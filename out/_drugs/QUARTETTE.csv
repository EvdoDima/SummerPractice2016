0, 1, ,I don't recommend taking this at all if you have any history of depression. I lasted almost 90 days but had to discontinue use due to constant thoughts of suicide and apathy. I was genuinely concerned if I kept taking them_ I would end up killing myself.,,F,21,1  days,6/13/2016,Quartette
1, 1, To prevent pregnancy,Fatigue_ Nausea_ Anxiety_ Depression,Do NOT! I repeat DO NOT take Quartette if you have any history of depression or anxiety. I had to quit after 7 days because the anxiety was so bad_ I felt like I was going to lose it. After quitting_ the anxiety got worse and mild depression set in. Thankfully I am already on an antidepressant (which I believe was counteracted by the Quartette). I have a feeling depression would be way worse if I wasn't already taking meds for it. Appointment with my psychiatrist next week to get this straightened out!!!,F,30,7  days,6/4/2016,Quartette
