0, 1, Osteoporosis,Began with severe lower back pain and gastro symptoms. Didn't make the connection to the Binosto until I visited my doctor and she did tests (negative) and I also went to physical therapy for my back which did not help. I know my body and I was totally fine BEFORE beginning Binosto. Stopped Binosto back in March_ after three months_ and STILL experience side effects... now have acid reflux and continued gastro issues. When will this end? I will never take an osteo med again_ ever. Poison is an understatement for these meds.,,F,55,3  months70 mg. 1X W,4/28/2014Email,Binosto
