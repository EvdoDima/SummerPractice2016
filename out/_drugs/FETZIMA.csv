0, 1, Major depression,SEVERE constipation SEVERE angerIncreased headaches_ continuing even after being off med for several months,This is NASTY. I had severe constipation & abdominal pain. Fiber & miralax didn't help. Needed 2 laxatives. I was also very angry & irritable all the time. No patience or tolerance. I have always been extremely patient. Felt like throwing things almost all the time. I feared I would throw things & hurt my cats. Thankfully I did neither. I am still VERY quick to anger & impatience. NOT me at all. Will this ever stop? Migraines & tension headaches increased in severity & frequency. STILL increased after several months off this crap. Good thing I'm disabled or I would have been fired for missing too much work. As it is_ my volunteer position has cut my hours_ so I guess that's being demoted. Grrrrrr :( :(,F,58,3  weeks40 mg,7/25/2016Email,Fetzima
1, 1, nerve pain,blurred  vision_ irritable_ heart pounding_,This has not helped the pain at all and I can't stand the side effects. Maybe if not already taking other meds it would be fine.,M,54,12  days20 mg 1X D,6/22/2016,Fetzima
2, 3, Severe depression,Sweats. Weight gain. Slight increase in energy.,Before fetzima I could not concentrate_focus_ have interest in doing anything_ could not follow instructions. Now I'm able to do all. I can have an intellectual conversation_ a whitty conversation_ focus_ concentrate_ do simple task. However I still cannot retain information well_ nor trust myself with house hold bills. The weight gain is at 50lbs_ sex- no interest what so ever. Not even cuddling_ the sweats have gotten worse. Been thinking about switching meds but so nervous to lose what I have gotten back.,F,52,1  years80mg,4/27/2016,Fetzima
3, 5, Major depression,"I've tried several antidepressants and this one has been way more effective than any others. My doctor has said that fetzima ""may"" give you a slight boost in energy or cause weight loss but it's been the opposite for me. I've gained about 35 lbs in a years time. Also causes excessive sweating with even slight activity.I look past these side effects though (even though the weight gain is a nightmare) because the drug itself has really helped me a great deal.",,F,40,1  years120,4/10/2016Email,Fetzima
4, 2, Major depression/Anxiety,Extreme sweating after any little exertion..intolerable. Gained 22 lb in 3 mo. time. Rapid heart rate. Absolutely no sex drive. Eyesight problems.,I have been on several antidepressants and I can say this med does help with the depression better than some but not the anxiety. I have had eyesight problems.. Blurry_dry eyes and thought it was due to age but reading these reviews I see more than half have the same issue. Time to see my doc for a change in meds.,,45,3  months20mg_1 x d,3/30/2016,Fetzima
5, 2, Depression & Anxiety,This medication helped with depression moderately. I was able to wake up and perform activities of daily living_ such as cooking_ cleaning_ and homework. However_ my energy did not increase with Fetizma. My energy remained the same: average. I have noticed a significant decrease in my sex drive. I do not even want to kiss or be physically intimate with my husband. However_ I am not sure if any other women have complained of this side effect.,,F,25,3  months80mg,1/27/2016,Fetzima
6, 1, Major depression,Higher BP and heart rate_ ice cold hands and feet all the time. Extreme sweating during the least little activity. Bad night sweats. Horrible dreams. Really bad aggression into month 2.,Would not recommend taking this med. Not only is it incredibly expensive_ the side effects I experienced did not out weigh the benefits. I did have a bit more energy in wanting to get up but the side effects took me down.,F,40,2  months40 mg,12/5/2015,Fetzima

9, 5, severe depression and anxiety,At first I sweat a LOT and my heart rate increased a little bit. That pretty much went away after a month. I had some issues with being grouchy and aggressive so my pdoc added 100 mg of Zoloft and that helped.,For me the combination of Fetzima and Zoloft has brought me out of a very deep depression. I can laugh again_ not crying all the time_ I have motivation again_ and I wake up ready to face the day rather than dread getting out of bed. There is hope!!!,F,38,3  months40 mg,10/18/2015Email,Fetzima
10, 3, Depression_ anxiety,Erectile dysfunction_ insomnia,Energising and seemed effective on my depression. Had good dreams -when I was able to sleep but sleeping more than 5 hours was next to impossible.  ED was severe. I don't think I had a full erection for the entire time I was on this med.  Seemed to relieve my arthritis pain. My wife ordered me stop taking because of the E.D.,M,58,3  weeks40 1X D,10/11/2015Email,Fetzima
11, 2, Major Depression_ General Anxiety,Delayed urination_ discomfort during orgasm_ difficulty sleeping through the night.,Fetzima didn't really seem to help with my depression_ and it made my anxiety worse. Shortly after beginning the 80mg dose_ I began waking up feeling panicked every morning.  After 2-3 weeks of this_ I knew it was time to try something else.,M,39,1  months80 MG 1X D,9/18/2015,Fetzima
12, 2, Depression,At first I had high hopes for this medication until the side effects finally overwhelmed the benefits.  I did feel less depressed the first month.  The worst side effects were headache_ eye pain and very affected vision problems that still persist over a month after stopping treatment.  I had some of the other dysfunction you can read under side effects_ but it was the vision issue that prompted me to stop the med.  Also_ the 2nd and 3rd months on this medication I noticed the depression coming back with a  vengeance.  I finally decided to stop when I could no longer read my books or even the print on this computer which I did enlarge.  I also developed liver symptoms which have gotten better since I stopped the med..,I guess many of these drugs are highly individual in their response both good and bad.  I really wanted this drug to work and I did hang in there with it_ but ultimately I had to let it go.,M,67,3  months40 MG 1X D,9/15/2015,Fetzima

21, 5, ,At first headache and nausea but it went away.,I only switched because of cost of my other med on new insurance.  Best thing ever!!  My sex drive had returned in a huge way after being severely absent for 10+ years and even ruining  a marriage.  This was a very pleasant and unexpected surprise. Depression is under control the same as the last med.  I've tried 10 different meds over the last 15 years and had given up on having a decent sex life in order to not be depressed.,F,36,1  weeks40,2/3/2015,Fetzima
