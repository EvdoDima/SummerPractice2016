2, 5, heart palpiations,None that I noticed.,Wonderful_ miracle cure for heart palpitations.  Unfortunately_ counter indicated with Latuda_ which I start a few months ago.  (Raises the serum levels of Latuda.) Had to switch to amilopine (sp?) and I have a lot of side effects with this new drug.  Too many so I'm not going to take it.,F,38,1  years120 1X D,3/30/2012,Cardizem
3, 1, Hypertension,Had experienced burning up oesophagus after taking Cardizem for approx 8 months.  Have had stomach burning and pain for 2 months.  ENDOSCOPY TODAY diagonised ulcers!!  I ceased Cardizem about 1 week ago and my conditioned improved immediately but still some burning and pain.,My doctor didn't know Cardizem caused epigastric pain until she checked her drug manual.  Thank goodness I looked it up and suggested to my dr that I was sure this was the cause of my problem. It may help to lower BP but who wants gastric ulcers?,F,60,18  months30mg 1X D,12/20/2011,Cardizem
