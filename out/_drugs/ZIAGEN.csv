0, 1, HIV,I was on it for 3 years and found that it is extremely expensive to maintain along with availability issues (not as widely available as other drugs). I ended up swapping it out for AZT along with my existing 3TC and EFV HAART regimen. Still undetectable and wish I could get back all of the money I wasted on Ziagen.,,M,47,3  years,5/4/2009,Ziagen
