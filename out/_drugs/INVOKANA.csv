0, 5, Type 2 diabetes,I've been diabetic for 32 yrs & had gastric bypass surgery 5 yrs ago to supposedly fix it & in spite of going from 310 to 115 lbs it remained! I take this with no side effects along with 1000 mg of metformin & my a1c is now 6.8_ my lowest.,Be careful about low blood sugar if you take another drug in addition to this,F,55,5  years100 mg,3/9/2016Email,Invokana
1, 2, Type II Diabetes,Take Invokana in the morning but wake up 4 to 5 times to urinate in the night_ so interrupts sleep. Not much noticeable difference in the day time.,I take Invokana in the morning with Metformin XR and an additional Metformin XR at night. This brings about minimal blood sugar control 175 - 195. Have medium stomach pains so may be getting the UTI everyone describes. Had much better luck with Glyburide alone but doctor won't prescribe anymore due to renal failure in some patients. Note: I also get dehydrated at night so have to drink several bottles of water at night.,M,59,3  months300mg 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Invokana
2, 3, High Blood Sugars,Frequent urinary tract infections and burning in penis.  Significant hair loss,Although this medicine is incredibly effective in both controlling blood sugars and even helping in weight loss_ the hair loss is a deal breaker for me.  And the urinary tract infections have resulted in multiple 30 day courses of levofloxin.,M,60,1.5  years300 mg 1X D,11/26/2015,Invokana
3, 5, diabetes,urgent urination after 3-3.5 hours sleep,miracle drug - many diabetes symptoms are gone......,M,76,7  days100mg 1X D,6/24/2015,Invokana
4, 1, For diabetes,Raised A1c. And tryglicerides,Took this because A1C was 7.4.  After 8 weeks it went UP to 7.6 !  Triglycerides went from 253. To 465.   Apparently the duretic effect of raising BS overrides the lowering effect for me.,F,56,8  weeks300 1X D,6/9/2015,Invokana
5, 4, High Blood sugar,Increase urination_ was on blood pressure meds but this lowered it too much in combination_ so blood pressure meds were halfed. I am still monitoring BP making sure it is adjusted correctly.,Monitor blood pressure when starting as this does lower it_ at least it did with me.   If you are female coat vulva area with vasoline or zinc ointment to prevent irritation as urine will be acidic and have more sugar than usual.   Also take empty soda bottle to bathroom and fill with water_ rinse off when finished.   This medicine is high maintenance with all that_ but the only one besides metformin that does not cause heart failure and pancreatic cancer at an alarming rate.,,,14  days100 1X D,2/6/2015Email,Invokana
6, 5, diabetes,In the beginning I had severe vaginal irritation and burning. It was so bad I could barely walk or sit. It also caused me to have low blood sugars and be rushed to hospital.  I did experience the uti. When first starting but now I no longer experience that. Plus I take metformin and that helps with exercise and healthy diet,,F,36,2  years,1/1/2015,Invokana
7, 5, Diabetes,None,Invokana has been a great drug for me and has lowered my A1C by  1.3% I also take Metformin and Tradjenta. I have not had any problems with this med what-so-ever and highly recommend it. I was skeptical at first due to reported UIT infections but this has NOT been a problem. I highly recommend this medication as a add on to your primary type II meds.,M,48,8  months100mg 1X D,12/22/2014Email,Invokana
8, 5, Diabetes,slight increase in frequency of urination,It was explained to me that this drug helps sugar leave the body through urination.  My blood glucose tests have dropped from an morning average of 190 to 130.  I am also on other diabetes drugs but it appears to me that this working well.,M,62,7  days300 MG 1X D,5/12/2014,Invokana
