0, 3, Shoulder pain and muscles aches,I noticed the first few days I was extremely tired. I would sleep for hours_ wake up and within an hour was tired again. Today was my first day without it and theres a big difference. My whole body hurts and I am in alot of pain.,,F,25,6  days20mg,2/4/2016,Amrix
1, 1, To sleep,I slept for 16-18 hours_ very nervous,scared me to death_ will not take again_ that is why I am researching it,F,62,1  days15mg 1X D,4/9/2015,Amrix
2, 5, Muscle sprain & spasms,Dry mouth_ thirsty all the time & slight drowsiness,I've been Amrix (which I found out was the ER version of Flexeril) for about 2 weeks now. In the beginning I didn't notice much of anything so I think you need to take it a few days before noticing any results. When it did kick in and my body was receiving it at the same time each day_ it did wonders. This coupled with Ibuprofen was a lifesaver. Spasms stopped spazing out and the strain slowly got better. I would recommend this to other patients however; it is pricey. Luckily my doctor gave me a coupon that made my copay $5!,F,36,2  weeks30 MG 1X D,2/2/2015Email,Amrix
3, 2, Neuromuscular pain,None,No side effects; no effects period. Just like taking a sugar pill.,F,58,30  days15 MG 1X D,10/16/2013,Amrix
4, 4, neuromuscular discomfort,Some sleep disturbances -- I wake up every couple of hours but am able to get right back to sleep. Does not make me sleepy during the day which is a very good thing.,Works pretty well_ not 100% though.,F,61,4  days15 mg 1X D,8/2/2013,Amrix
5, 2, Chronic Back Pain_ Muscle Spasms,Dry month,,F,32,1  days15mg,6/28/2013,Amrix
6, 5, Muscle Spasms/Lower Back Pain,Desire to sleep was strong at first but i take it at night_ so that dosen't bother me. With the coupon provided by the manufacturer on their website_ the cost is about $10 a month. When I have extreme pain_ I add a Vicodin or Tramadol. It has also just recently went generic ! I also use this drug for PMS/Menstrual Cramps and it works great.I would encourage new users to to start this drug over the weekend_ so you can see how your body will react. I have no problems_ driving or going to work after taking this drug_ but everyone is different.,,F,28,180  days30 mg 1X D,7/18/2011,Amrix
7, 4, Chronic spinal muscle spasms,,,F,48,1  years15mg 1X D,6/25/2011EmailHistory,Amrix
8, 5, Muscle Spasms/Scapular Bursitis,Expected drowsiness & Dry Mouth.,Worked well for me. I had the expected drowsiness initially the first few days of taking the medicine but that has since diminished. Doesn't really make me that drowsy now. This did help with the chronic muscle spams that I had_ but just seem to take the edge off. Might require slightly higher dose than 10 mg_ but will let the Doctor decide that when I return. Only real side effect was dry mouth_ or feeling thirsty.,M,29,1  months10 mg 3X D,1/3/2011,Amrix
9, 5, back spasm,A bit of dry mouth_ but not enough to stop taking the medicine.,My doctor told me to take it between 6 and 7 PM so that I wouldn't be drowsy the next day.  He also said it didn't matter if I took it with or without food.  It worked really well and I wasn't tired the next morning like some of the other muscle relaxers have made me in the past.,M,28,10  days15 mg 1X D,11/16/2010,Amrix
10, 1, muscle relaxer/pain,I took this pill roughly 10-10:30 Tuesday night.  It's now 11:48 and I still don't feel right.  I've probably been awake about 6 hours today max.  I just keep sleeping and I feel so lethargic and not right.,,F,40,1  days15 1X D,9/1/2010,Amrix
11, 2, neck-nerve/muscle pain,extreme dizziness and fatigue,I took just one pill at about 8:30 at night and the next day at 7am_ i could barely get out bed for work. I almost fell asleep driving and the fatigue and dizziness have lasted all day so far and its 1pm in the afternoon. I hope it wears off soon but im worried the feeling will last longer due to other patients experience. The Amrix drug fact page i dont believe is honest about what percentage of patients experience somnolence and dizziness. I will never take this again,F,29,1  days15mg 1X D,8/27/2010,Amrix
12, 1, Back spasm,Extreme drowsiness_ faintness_ brain fog_ zoning/focus trouble_excessive sleep and moodiness.,Took it one time for my spasm last Saturday_ and it worked great on the spasm but left me dysfunctional for two days afterward.  Still not feeling myself_ and here it is Tuesday.  Will stick with pain meds_ heat_ and PT.,F,49,1  days15 mg 1X D,6/22/2010,Amrix
13, 3, Pain in the shoulder joint,Extreme drowsiness and disorientation.,I took the pill in the evening not long before going to bed.  I had a very hard time getting up in the morning and was disoriented and groggy at school (I'm a teacher).  I felt like a Zombie all day. I fell asleep while proctoring an exam_ then later after school while doing prep work on computer.  At home_ I fell asleep at the dinner table.  After dinner_ I went to bed and slept for 9 1/2 hours_ extremely rare for me to sleep more than 6 hours. The pain went away though and I was glad I didn't need to take another pill.,M,63,1  days15mg 1X D,5/20/2010,Amrix
14, 1, Help Endure Physical Therapy,Day one took dose @ 6pm - blurry vision and disoriented for about an hour. Slept great that night and felt ok the next day. Day 2 took 2nd dose @ 6pm - slept great that night by 10 am the next day Horrible anxiety attack with redness of face and chest - felt like I was sitting in front of a fire; thought I was going to die - very anxious_ nervous_ tense_ increased heart rate_ disoriented_ confused... horrible_ horrible feeling!,I would not recommend this medication to anyone without constant medical supervision!!! Dangerous!!!!,F,42,2  days50 1X D,4/27/2010Email,Amrix
15, 4, Neck Spasms Chronic,Increased AM drowsiness.   At first getting up in the AM was challenging.  I stopped taking the drug after 10days.  My dr convinced me to give it another try.  I have been on it again for 3 weeks and feeling better than I have in years.   I am still very tierd in the AM but work full time at a professional position.   Since I am not in pain I can focus better on work and less on pain.,,F,39,21  days,11/7/2009,Amrix
16, 4, neck & back pain,headache when i first wake up but gone within 2-3 hours,this medication does not make me drowsy at all_ no hangover feeling the next day. i was afraid i would have trouble getting up the next day_ but although it helps me sleep_ i have no trouble getting up. it helps me a lot more than short term muscle relaxers! i'm by no means pain free_ but it does take the edge off,F,35,1  months,9/10/2009,Amrix
17, 4, Deep muscle spasms,The most notable side effect is drowsiness; since it's a 24-hour extended release medication_ it comes with 24-hour extended release drowsiness!,I take Amrix 15mg capsules_ 1-2 as needed for deep muscle spasms.  It's great for releasing muscles that are locked tight and not responding to shorter acting muscle relaxants_ but it's not suitable for long-term daily use because of the drowsiness.,F,36,6  months,9/3/2009,Amrix
18, 1, Low back pain (herniate disc L4-L5),"I took Amrix 30 mgs at 5pm and the next day I could not function.  Very sleepy and ""drugged up"" feeling.  Felt like I could not concentrate.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I will never take this medication again.",,F,49,1  days,8/24/2009,Amrix
19, 2, Strained Muscle,Extreme drowisness and unable to focus,I can't believe they prescribe medication like this. This has to be the worst thing I have ever taken. Please use caution with this medication. The warnings are not lying. I took it at 7:00 at night_ and apparently 18 hours of sleep was not good enough. It took a good 2 days to get out of my system. Never again.,M,33,5  days,6/10/2009,Amrix
20, 3, chronic nerve pain in mid back,taking 15mg at night and the first 4 days experienced only dry mouth and extreme thirst---side effects I could live with. After 4 days_ I struggled to stay awake even after 8 hours of sleep and an afternoon nap (something I never did before). I could not take this drug daily anymore. Works well on loosening up muscles I thought were permanently frozen.,works great if you don't mind sleeping your life away!,F,53,7  days,5/14/2009,Amrix
