I have changed my diet and exercise regularly. I am going to try the natural way first before going back to medication. I have a doctors appointment in 3 days and will bring this to his attention.

4, 1, cholesterol,We all know how painful a charlie horse is. Now imagine that pain in your legs_ neck_ ribs_(especially ribs) arms and every where else imagineable. Sitting_ standing_ or lying down I have cramps. Add having to be on your feet all day at work and you're really talking pain.,I went to my doctor about this pain because it was disrupting my home life as well as interfering with my job. I had body scans_ blood tests_ (more than $600.00 worth) ultra sounds and was even sent to a specialist and just two days ago she decides to take me off of Tricor. When I looked this drug up I was shocked and furious to see this site. Why wasn't this done in the first place? Now I have to wonder if this will be a permant problem or if it will cause permant damage. I was also told I have an accelerated heart rate. Is this also a symptom?,F,55,1  years48MG 1X D,9/29/2010,Tricor
