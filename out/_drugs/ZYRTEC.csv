3, 1, Hay Fever,I ended up getting huge itchy welts all over my body. It took a while to realize that it was the Zyrtec causing it because why would an antihistamine produce a horrible allergic reaction like that! As soon as I stopped taking it the welts went away and I even tried taking it another time because I still found it weird that it would cause an allergy when it treats allergies! The itchy welts came back. If I scratched them_ it was almost impossible not to_ they would increase to 2 inches in diameter. It was horrible.,,F,38,14  days1 pill 1X D,7/22/2016,Zyrtec

5, 1, Allergies,I didn't have side effects until I ran out of Zyrtec for a couple days. I started itching and feeling sick. It was easy to guess that this was the culprit. Then i went online and started reading how toxic this drug is. About day 3 my itching and sneezing was out of this world. I have clawed and scratched my skin off and have hives on my chest and neck. I refuse to give in and take another one. I'll be half dead and miserable or go to the hospital one...but i won't ever take this again. Poison_ not to mention makes you retain water and gain weight.

I didn't take Zyrtec last night because I'm so sick of not getting any sleep and don't want to risk developing any other problems and I really hope it goes well.

Mild headache and dizziness.,"To be fair_ I don't find the words ""non-drowsy"" anywhere on Zyrtec's web site_ so I can't claim they misled me.  But for me_ the drowsiness and fatigue caused by this medication has been so overwhelming and long-lasting that it's worse than useless.  I'd only touch this stuff in the event of a literally life-threatening allergic reaction_ and then only if I can't get my hands on an EpiPen.Worse_ it didn't seem to do much for my rash.",M,43,3  days10mg 1X D,6/25/2016,Zyrtec

I run 5 miles a day x5 days a week and was surprised at this sudden increase in weight and bloating.  Also triggered an increase in hunger.  Never experienced psychological issues (mood swings_ insomnia_ irritability_ anxiety_ depression) before until I started taking this drug. Although the psychological symptoms are mild_ they are still upsetting.  These side effects started about 1 week after I started taking it.

Words are indescribable the wonders this site has done for me as I was not sure what was going on with me.

Also_ I noticed my feet ankles being swollen and I do not consuming that much of salt diets. I thought Zyrtec_ and other Allergy-related drugs are not supposed to cause such harm as others have commented on its use. According to my Ear and Throat doctor_ Zyrtec and other related Allergy Meds and Sprays should be safe since they do not go through one's bloodstream but showed otherwise. With all these negatives being noted about Zyrtec and other Allergy drugs_ I as a person with allergies do not know else what to take.  ,If an adult person is experiencing such severe problems_ what about children_ babies (toddlers) for that matter_ who are unable to express their feelings_ is very devastating; Zyrtec and others similar to it need monitoring and regulating by the Food Drug Administration or any other departments responsible to oversee drugs usage.,F,54,  1X AN,3/10/2016,Zyrtec

Given this by doctor,"Heart racing_ anxious_ feeling uncoordinated_ dizzy_ feeling ""drunk"" while walking_ shaking_ dry mouth.",I don't have enough words for what this medication has done to me. I was standing in church today looking like a drunk (BTW I don't drink). My movement was so slow. I had to hold on to walls the last five days. My coworkers didn't want me driving and I haven't driven in two days. And today_ to top it off_ I thought my heart was going to race out of my chest. I would have never thought an allergy medicine could cause such issues. I haven't played with my son because I can't do it. I finally spent the whole day doing research. Why is this medicine an OTC when its so dangerous? I thought I was losing it! There are so many people saying what it does wrong to them. I still don't really have the coordination to type this.

After taking it for a few days_ I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time in my life. Since I had just started taking this medicine_ I decided to look up other side effects of zyrtec. I couldn't believe that an allergy medication could cause something as horrible as sleep paralysis_ but apparently I'm not the only one who experienced it. Also_ I noticed that i was really out of it the few days I was taking this but I didn't think anything of it until recently. Also I was a lot more anxious than usual.

It did relieve my allergies_ and the doctor said it was best to take it consistently_ so I was. While on this_ I seriously thought about hurting myself_ I thought about hurting my husband_ and I had completely unreasonable thoughts and reactions to people. I have never been in such a dark place in my head. Soon after I stopped taking Zyrtec_ I was back to normal. This is scary stuff_ and I can't believe it's on the market.

I'm not one to take medication so I took it only when I  felt I needed it.  I took most of medication during the day and noticed with I took the first dose it made me feel anxious and my heart  started to race a bit..  Can't take any decongestants because it makes my heart race.  So I thought this was okay to take.  Took it on another occasion at around 6 in the evening.  When I went to bed around 10 and laid down to go to sleep I felt very nervous and anxious.  Took my heart rated and it felt as though I was out jogging_  About 4 in the morning my heart rate finally slowed to normal.  Took the bottle to my Dr. and told him to put it on my allergy list.

I have stopped taking Zyrtec and never want to use it again.,Stopping Zyrtec is awful. The itching is so intense and a new one - my lips have been swollen all day. This is day 3 of withdrawal.

However the vertigo still comes intermittently especially if I lie down but triggers vary - a nightmare. I hope it isnt going to be permanent and that my lips will go back to normal.

They have been bad this year and I needed to look for something new after not being able to control a persistent hacking cough for over three weeks.  Right away I noticed this medication made me tired.  Not unexpected and for the relief I needed I could deal with that. Then I noticed my mouth and eyes became extremely dry.  Since it helped to dry up some of my congestion and  seemed to offer me some relief_ I thought ""I can deal"".  I am a very active person and exercise (cardio_ weights_ biking and running) regularly and I noticed that the mouth dryness became pretty intense during exercise_ no matter how much water I drank (and I usually have 64 ounces of water or more pre exercise).  It felt like I had a dry sponge in my mouth.  On top of that_ when I was active I noticed I needed to take frequent breaks to catch my breath and to help the feeling that my heart was going to thump out of my chest subside.  I felt winded even walking up stairs.  No thank you to all of that!  Plus_ I quickly noticed that when I tried to sleep my legs felt restless and my sleep quality was poor.  All of these things are very unlike me.  I went off the Zyrtec-D three days ago and onto a natural allergy relief product and already feel a world better!

If you have metabolic problems it will increase the intensity of side effects such as extreme somnolence_ agitation and dry mouth as the drug will stay in your system longer.Using the drug has been very effective over the years. I was originally prescribed this over 10 years ago for chronic red-eye and found it was_ when taken consistently for a 1-2 weeks will improve  inflammation and will remain effective for a period of upto a month.The problem with taking zyrtec for this amount of time is the side effects become much more noticeable and compound to the point where I have to decide on to continue or stop taking zyrtec for a time.After continual doses over a few days i become agitated_ have confused dreams_ and lose sleep. The immediate side effect is extreme somnolence that persists for hours or days after the last dose if i havent taken it for a period of time. Yes_ zyrtec is a life saver for my conditions but it comes at a cost of effectiveness vs side effects.

50, 4, Seasonal Hay Fever,Dry nose_ nasal crusting_ blood in nose_ mild drowsiness,This stuff works well on hay fever_ maybe a little too well because I can only take half a pill and I'll be good for about 3 days. It does make me a little bit drowsy so I take it at night_ sometimes I wake up and feel fine_ other times I've felt a bit foggy but it wears off. It also dries up my nose because it's strong_ I get a lot of crusting and blood due to the dryness. However these side effects are tolerable and better than having bad hay fever.,M,27,3  months 2X W,8/28/2015Email,Zyrtec
51, 1, Seasonal allergies,Daily drowsiness_ severe funk_ increased appetite.,I was so relieved when I came across this site!  Just spent an entire weekend in a horrible funk!!!!  It's Monday and I couldn't even work from home.  It's like my brain was sleeping.  I gave up and slept for 2 hours after a full 8 hours of sleep the night before.  I am normally a high energy person so I thought I was losing my mind until I realized the only change is I started Zyrtec last week and was told by the pharmacist for best results take it daily.  He said for best results take it everyday whether you're experiencing symptoms or not.  When I woke up I decided to Google Zyrtec side effects and it wasn't until I found these consumer comments that I know to quit taking Zyrtec!!!!!,F,45,7  days10 mg 1X D,8/24/2015,Zyrtec
52, 1, Year round indoor outdoor allergies,Irritability_ severe depression_ lethargy.,On this for probably 15 years after trying so many others that either didn't do the job of muting the allergies or their side effects were completely unbearable from the start. While Zyrtec works for the most part_ I did notice that my body wasn't responding to the anti allergy effect as well- still suffered on this. Went off a few weeks ago because the depression is changing who I am - and I feel like I actually went ON an antidepressant_ it's that much of a difference being OFF this drug. Into week 2 1/2 or 3 without: hands are swelling_ hot and itching like crazy- feet to a lesser degree. Been reading that this is common withdrawal. We take these pills for years like its nothing but the withdrawal is evidence that we've become dependent on it.,F,40,10  years,8/15/2015,Zyrtec
53, 1, Seasonal allergies,My son was experiencing seasonal allergies and rashes due to moving into a rental that previously had cats and dogs. After many sleepless nights of scratching himself to the point of bleeding_ I took him to an allergist who recommended 5 mg of Zyrtec each day. I had him taking 1/2 of the dissolvable tablets with no noticeable side effects. A few days ago I switched to the liquid and he's been an emotional wreck. He's unable to cope with any changes or upsets. He has thrown several tantrums that last for an hour or mor_ and he also started waking up in the middle of the night screaming from nightmares. My husband suggested it may be the Zyrtec and low and behold_ I find this thread. I will never use Zyrtec or any other allergy medication after reading the experiences on this site. Thank you for all of your helpful stories.,,M,3.5,1  months5mg,7/29/2015,Zyrtec
54, 3, hayfever symptoms,Itchy toes_ others I'm not sure about. It also isn't absolutely successful in stopping hayfever symptoms_ mine were only reduced.,I've taken a generic version of Zyrtec for about 3-4 years_ often missing doses and only taking pills when I felt symptoms coming on_ so I can't be certain of the links between it and my experiences. I also take it far more regularly in winter than in summer. I found many negative reviews about Zyrtec a couple of days ago_ and many side effects described were eerily similar to what I've experienced these past couple of years. Bad temper_ mood swings_ depression_ insomnia and sleeping too much were things I noticed in the colder seasons_ which I used to always pin on just being a teenager/the weather etc. It's currently winter where I am_ and to test my theory_ I stopped taking Zyrtec yesterday. Today_ I feel different_ anxious_ I woke up much earlier this morning than usual_ and I think I have itchy hives on my toes_ which I used to always take Zyrtec for after noticing it.  I'll update this review later on.,F,17,3  years10mg 1X D,7/16/2015Email,Zyrtec
55, 3, Allergies,Drowsiness.,Could not stay awake with this medication. Would sleep for 10-12 hours and still feel tired after getting out of bed. I even tried splitting the pill to make 5 mg dose_ but still felt very drowsy. This medication works_ but the side effect is just a shame.,F,26,2  days10 mg 1X D,7/13/2015,Zyrtec
56, 2, ,Moodiness not sleeping well my friend asked about what allergy medication she was taking and now I think I have found the reason for her outburst. I am still going to have her see a therapist just in case it is so something else. I think the medicine has a lot to do with her outburst though and her lack of sleep,,F,11,1  years30mg,7/3/2015Email,Zyrtec

58, 3, Allergies to several things,My daughter has statted Zyrtec for her allergies and she has always been our quiet and calm child. I have noticed though since she's been on it she has gotten worse with her attitude. She will scream at us_ screams the hole time she is in time out_ and will smack her sister for nothing. She just told me today she gets this feeling in her that makes her mad and want to hit people_scream_& throw things. This is not our little girl at all. I seriously think it is the Zyrtec because she was never like this until she was put on it. School she is stil quiet and shy but I am afraid she is going to start acting out and I do not want that for my child. I will be calling the allergy doc for sure after all these comments.,,F,6,1  days8ml,6/19/2015Email,Zyrtec
