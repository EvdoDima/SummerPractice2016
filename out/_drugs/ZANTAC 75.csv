9, 1, acid reflux,It would help the reflux and then the acid would come back worse.  I was getting acid reflux from everything I ate including water.  My stomach was not digesting.  Once a week I would spend a day throwing up.,I stopped taking the zantac.  The first two days I thought I was going to die.  After that the symptoms went away.  I can now eat pizza again.

11, 4, Gerd,If I go up on dose_ I seem to have a little difficulty sleeping,I have been taking this about nine years_ 75 mg about an hour or two before dinner. I'm usually sensitive to most drugs but was pleased with little or no side effects. Alcohol still causes problems. A few years ago it began to seem less effective and higher doses for me seemed to affect my sleep so I also raised the head of my bed which helped. Large meals late with challenging foods such as tomatoes and tomato sauce still get me up with reflux. Worth a try.,M,51,9  years75 mg 1X D,3/25/2010,Zantac 75

15, 5, asthma_ angioedema,None unless I take it right before bed_ which gives me a stomachache.  I just make sure to take it about an hour before bed and drink plenty of water.,As an earlier poster said_ this is a type of antihistamine.  I don't know what I would do without this drug.  I used to have severe problems with asthma and angioedema.  The zantac has completely stopped all of that.  I used to have daily asthma attacks and wake up in the morning with a swollen face and trouble breathing.  I suffered for years until an ER doctor told me about some new studies_ where they found that acid-reflux medications can help with asthma in certain people.  My life is so much better now.,F,27,2  years,1/10/2008,Zantac 75
