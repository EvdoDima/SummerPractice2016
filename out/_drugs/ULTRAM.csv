0, 1, Joint pain,Helped with pain from the start. I took it at bedtime about 3-4 nights a week. About 3 weeks in_ I became ill- thought I had flu or food poisoning. I was dizzy_ sensitive to light_ and felt like I couldn't keep my eyes open. I felt like I could only close my eyes and lay in bed- hoping it would pass. I was sweaty_ flushed_ and had no appetite whatsoever. I had diarrhea as well.  I thought I was going to vomit every second. This went on for 2 days. 3rd day in I went to Dr. - hoping for anti emetic and relief. Dr. ordered a host of labs and did a thorough neuro exam. No answers- all labs normal. After going through everything myself to figure out what was wrong- I realized Ultram was newest RX. Read medical info- and clearly this was the issue and cause of my illness. Ugh!,I will never take Ultram ever again. What horrible side effects I experienced. Not to mention loss of work and family time. This RX should not be used lightly and without upfront discussion with Dr. and pharmacist. Research and discuss other options.,F,46,4  weeks50mg,8/12/2016,Ultram
1, 3, interstital cystitis pain,muscle stiffness_ joint pain. Feels like the worst case of Fibromyalgia!!! This is a rare side effect of the drug. I could not even squeeze a bottle of shampoo so had to get off the drug. I now have permanent damage from this drug .,Worked great for the burning pain of Interstital Cystitis . My body adapted and I found that I continually had to increase the dosage .,F,48,3  years200,6/18/2016Email,Ultram

4, 5, permanent neck & back injuries.,Mental energy..and verbal diarrhea lol I can't stop talking for like 2 hrs after taking it.

6, 4, cervical kyphosis and DDD,sweats,I increased the amount I take very slowly and have avoided most side effects.  I also take with food.  I'm now up to 2.5 50mg/day heading towards 3/day.  It helps the pain but doesn't remove it completely--I take it with ibuprofen.  My conditions are inoperable and worsening with age.  I can't believe I hesitated to take this because of the addictive qualities.  Not only am I never going to be able to go off of this_ even if I do have to some day_ I'll just taper off gradually.  I recently completed a 6 mo. withdrawal from gabapentin (2700 mg.) without having to miss any work.  If I can do that_ I can withdraw from this_ no problem.,F,58,3  months50mg 3X D,8/30/2015,Ultram

15, 5, back pain _arthritis,had to take the last dose 6 hrs before bed or had trouble getting to sleep,excellent pain med for moderate acute and chronic pain. I had no trouble quitting it when I was pain free. It does raise the norepinephrine level a bit giving an energy boost. I had also read it stimulates the immune system to an extent unlike opioids which suppress it,M,,30  years50mg 2X D,10/30/2014,Ultram
16, 5, Post surgical pain (cancer),The only bothersome side affect that I have is a very dry mouth.  I was on dilaudid 4mg every 4 hours for 6 months after my upper left lobectomy. The doctor wanted me off of it of course so switched me to tramadol. The scar on my back is 9 inches long and my muscles and nerves were cut so I will always have pain. The tramadol definitely takes away my pain and gives me a mental boost. If I forget a dose_ I really feel it in my back and my mood. I am cancer free today and very happy! Stage 3b lung cancer.  As far as withdrawal when I no longer need it_ I doubt I will ever come off if it.  If I'm addicted I feel it's ok because at least I'm able to live a good quality of life!!,,F,51,2  years100mg 4xd,7/2/2014,Ultram

18, 5, Severe chronic pain (Lupus_ FM),constipation_ increased sweating,This drug has been a miracle for me. It takes a while to kick in_ and I wished it would be more fast-acting. However_ it does take away the severe pain I have been living with for 5 years. Without Tramadol_ I wouldn't be able to function_ and now I can lead an - almost - normal life. If I have some breakthrough pain during the day_ Tylenol Arthritis takes care of it. Very rarely do I need to take 100mg at bedtime.The constipation is greatly relieved by taking two soft gels of Liquid Magnesium Oxide (important as Magnesium comes in different formulations/ only the oxide one helps; also works as a muscle relaxant) at night.,F,44,10  months150 1X D,5/26/2014,Ultram

21, 5, sciatica_arthritis,It makes me feel very alert but relaxed_kind of don't care feeling.It feels like I could go to sleep but I can't. I call it twilight sleep b/c when I try to sleep_ I am in and out every few minutes untill it wears off_ which it takes up to 18hours. Next day I have bad headache.,"I only take it as needed_ 30 pills last me easy one year.It does work like a magic and I like the feeling when on it.I have OCD and SPD so being on it makes me feel relaxed but very alert and ""aware"" and ""friendly"". One pill lasts up to 18 hours. I use to suffer from Migraines and it did help with the pain some_ however now without Migraines_ it gives mi headache the next day.My boyfriend on the other hand gets very sick and throws up. He has very bad Dermatitis but can't take it. I only take it when absolutely needed b/c I worry it might have bad effect on my heart long term plus I don't want to go on other pain pill like codeine b/c it makes me very sick.I know someone who takes it every day and it affects him the same way_ very relaxed feeling almost like antidepressant.This is the only pain pill that works for me very well.Few years ago I had abcessed tooth and took 2-100 pills every 3 hours and it killed the pain but I was VERY dizzy and could not drive.",M,52,12  years50-100 1X AN,1/13/2014Email,Ultram
22, 4, fibromyalgia,First noticed itching but that went away in time. I lost almost 30 pads and I was already thin due to ed.

No withdrawal symptoms from true opioids but this was awful. This drug should be taken off the market!,,F,31,5  months400,8/6/2013,Ultram
25, 5, chronic pain,none,I have to stand or walk most of the day at work and suffer from chronic pain in my feet.  Doctors have not agreed on a diagnosis_ from tendinitis_ or nerve damage_ to prolapse of bones or tissues.  This medication allows me to function almost normally when I need to.,F,61,6  months25 mg 2X D,8/3/2013,Ultram
26, 5, Lupus_ FM,none whatsoever,When my doctor prescribed this medication and I took it for the first time_ I couldn't believe how I had survived without it for so long. The pain in my joints and connective tissue can be excruciating and would normally force me to stay in bed all day. I now take 3x50mg tablets at 6:00am every morning_ and by 9:00am I am usually able to get up and get ready for work. Without Tramadol/Ultram I couldn't even lift my arms to take a shower. Wonder drug for me.,F,42,1  years150 1X D,7/13/2013,Ultram
27, 4, Lupus and Fibromyalgia pain,Hard to say exactly what symptoms are caused by Tramadol_ as I am on numerous meds_ but I do experience mild relief from sometimes MAJOR lupus pain. It does not make me confused_ sleepy_ or dizzy. Weight gain when I started this and 2 other meds_ but it doesn't seem that is common with Tramadol_ so I don't think it's the culprit. I sweat like a menopausal woman or chemo patient just by vacuuming. It may be the lupus_ but my doctor feels that it is the Tramadol causing it. Yuck.,I like this medication. For most people with mild to moderate pain_ this is a great choice. My lupus affects my joints and tendons_ and it often feels like someone is injecting battery acid into my joints_ so I'm on the high end of pain many days. It is not strong enough for all of my pain_ so I have a breakthrough pain med_ but it is a good daily medication_ and when I miss it_ I do not feel any side effects_ i.e. it is not addictive for me. The only downside is the sweats. Keep a handkerchief handy just in case. Also be careful not to take too many. It slows your breathing_ and can cause you to stop breathing in your sleep if you overdose.,F,38,1  years100 mg 4X D,7/2/2013Email,Ultram

29, 4, Headache caused by chemotherapy,Itching_ euphoric,I personally like this medication; it just dulls the pain_ doesn't really take it away but it's better than nothing and I like that I don't have to have a hard copy of the prescription. It did cause a lot of itching at first so I took it with Benadryl and then I started to get over the itching. It doesn't put me to sleep like some other pain meds and I stopped taking it a couple days ago (as chemo is over) and I don't feel any discomfort_ i.e. withdrawal. Maybe that will come later but for now_ I'm satisfied with the results and would take it again.,F,48,2  months50 2X D,5/31/2013Email,Ultram
30, 1, shoulder pain,I took one dose at bedtime and woke up in the middle of the night itching_ but it wasn't severe and I fell back asleep.  In the morning I was so dizzy and sleepy_ I had a hard time getting kids ready for school.  I was too dizzy to drive so someone else had to drive them to school.  I went back to sleep for 3 hours.  I remained dizzy the rest of the day with a slight headache and even took another nap.,This drug did NOT help my pain at all.  I will not take this drug again.,F,35,1  days50 mg 1X D,5/23/2013Email,Ultram
31, 5, Fibromyalgia pain_ chronic fatigue,Itching around my nose if I take a dose too close to bedtime. I use Lanacane to help relieve the itch.,Thank God for Tramadol! Without this med_ I'm curled into a little ball in my bed due to my fibro pain. It also gives me a little energy_ especially if I drink caffeinated tea during the day. Other than the itching_ NO side effects.Even though I've been taking it for 4 years_ it is still effective - so no tolerance build-up is happening so far. I ran out one time_ and I didn't feel withdrawal symptoms like I've experienced with some antidepressants and other pain killers - I was just back to feeling my normal_ unbearable pain. Remember that meds work differently for different people. I hope this med works for you like it did for me. -F.L.,F,56,4  years50 mg 8X D,3/25/2013Email,Ultram

33, 3, Recreational Uses for depression,While my body was getting used to it_ when I took 5_ i would sometimes vomit and my heart rate would get fast. I would also lose appetite and be fatigued.  Even after my body was used to it_ I would still have a loss of appetite and I would be tired.,It isn't addictive,M,16,4  months450mg 1X D,3/17/2013Email,Ultram
34, 5, Sciatica/Mild Depression,Dry mouth_ constipation_ severe difficulty waking up_ sexual dysfunction_ slight dizziness.,I have been taking Tramadol for 4 years_ and just recently attempted to wean myself off of the drug. HUGE mistake. While I did not have severe physical withdrawals (as my weaning process was lengthy) I still had mild fatigue_ a little weight gain_ and could feel myself falling deeper into depression everyday without the drug. This went on for a month. I finally went back to the doc_ and am now back on 50mg 2x daily. My depression went away after 2 weeks_ energy levels are back to normal_ the 5 pounds I gained is gone and my pain is in check. However_ the trade-off is dry mouth_ some constipation_ trouble experiencing orgasm_ low libido_ dizziness even when sitting_ and difficulty waking up in the morning. The latter is probably the worst?I will hit snooze for an hour or two in the morning?or just sleep right through without even hitting snooze or turning it off. Once_ my husband said he wanted to see how long I would let the alarm go; he clocked 42 minutes of the alarm blaring and me barely moving. I could only imagine how I'd be if I were to take the max dose of 400mg. To sum it up_ Tramadol works well for my pain and depression_ but now I wonder how in the world will I get through my next attempt at weaning off the drug.,F,35,4  years50mg 2X D,3/16/2013Email,Ultram
35, 2, Kidney Infection/Kidney Stones,Severe Muscle Twitches_ Anxiety_ Lack of Pain Control.,Didn't necessarily take pain away_ but 'disconnected' me from it (and most everything else). Second day started noticing mild muscle twitches in my eyelid and base of my thumb in my hand. This quickly progressed with 24 hours into a constant spasm of the hand muscle. Also_ found it very hard to urinate. Twitches eased off within 6 to 8 hours_ of single dose_ stopped taking for about 36 hours. Then took two for onset of severe kidney pain in the evening following day. Within two hours severe muscle twitches (all over) rapid heart rate_ restlessness_ shallow breathing_ jaw clenching_ unable to sleep_ minimal pain control_ nausea. I thought this must be a what a panic attack feels like. I have never had one_ before though. Called nurse and she made me feel like a child_ and didnt' have a clue as to why I would react like this way. Needless to say_ I discontinued use. It's a month and a half later_ and I am still noticing alot of random muscle twitches. Never again!.,F,33,4  days50mg 3X D,2/20/2013,Ultram
36, 5, Fibromyalgia,I have seen a lot of Ultram reviews about how addictive and difficult this med is_ but it worked well for me. When I stopped taking it_ it was no big deal. I didn't have any withdrawals_ sickness_ or anything else. As with any med_ you could be allergic to it. It is very effective for me. It does cause dry mouth!,,F,44,2  years300,2/19/2013,Ultram
37, 1, Fibromyalgia,I had seizers_ horrible headaches that made my face tingle_ severe sweating and so much more! I was hospitalized for a week in the ICU due to the seizures I was having as a side effect from this drug. And went through severe withdrawal when the hospital took me off of it. NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG! Horrible.,,F,17,2  months50 MG,2/15/2013Email,Ultram
38, 4, Back pain,Loss of appetite_ irritability_ anxious & jumpy,The medicine seems to help with the pain but I have no appetite...probably not a bad thing for me though.  The worst immediate side effects were severe irritability & jumpiness.....like I feel like I want to fight & can't get still.....like I could run a marathon or something.  It's a very weird feeling....not sure how long I'll take this stuff.,F,27,1  days30 mg 1X D,2/8/2013Email,Ultram
39, 1, back pain,suicide,My son (age 30) cannot speak for himself and I wonder how many other people have experienced what he did. Within 4-5 hours of taking Ultram for the first time_ he picked up a pistol and put a bullet through his brain. I am the caretaker of his memory_ so I'm putting his age and gender.,M,30,1  times50 mg 4X D,2/8/2013Email,Ultram
40, 1, Kidney Infection,Some itching on the skin.  But more than anything: persistent & intensely severe headaches (felt like my entire skull was being hammered over and over).  Even the bones on my face ached with pain.  This drug pained my sinus cavities and caused me to have uncontrollably runny nose out of the blue.  Could barely open my eyes because I was too exhausted from the pain_ but couldn't even fall asleep because the drug kept me awake.  So I just lie awake with the pain_ or pace around like a lunatic until I became too weak to stand up.  Tramadrol drove me to the point of insanity.  I even resorted to banging my head against the wall to give minor relief to the unbearable headaches.  Couldn't focus on anything else because the headache was constant and extreme_ unlike any other headaches I've ever had. In fact_ I would rather much go through childbirth than have the headaches from Tramadol.,I quit after 3 days.  Yes_ it concealed my kidney pain_ but it caused me even more pain than that.  It was a nightmare I never want to go through again.  Felt like hell.  Funny thing was_ I called the doctor's office and the nurse acted surprised and said that Tramadol does not cause headaches.  Look at the Rx warnings_ moron!  It says to call my doctor ASAP if I get severe & persistent headaches!,F,32,3  days50 4X D,2/3/2013Email,Ultram

42, 5, Significant Back Pain,After pill wore off (about six hours) experienced headache_ slight nauseous_ and very sleepy and tired - needed nap and I never nap. Thought this was perhaps co-incidence the first day. Symptoms repeated on the second day- Also became a bit sweaty and nauseous in the car - a sip of soda and some crackers seemed to help - not serious. I think it is withdrawal symptom when drug wears off.,If I can get adequate relief from heating pad and tylenols_ I won't take it again. I can never take NSAIDS like Motrin or Advil - they might work - but I develop hemorrhagic coliis even after one dose of them. The Ultram_ fortunately_ did not cause this. My GI doctor said it was OK to take - although he thought the orthopod should have prescribed a muscle relaxer like Flexeril instead of this.,F,60,2  days50 mg 1X D,12/8/2012,Ultram

48, 4, Fibromyalgia Pain Control,No side effect for me at all.,The only bad thing is that I am about to be moved up to a much stronger drug for pain management because it no longer does the job. But if you are in need of pain relief and haven't had Fibromyalgia for 20 years like I have when no one had ever head of this sydrome and those who had wasn't for sure it was for real. It will take the edge off but be aware.....nothing will take away all the pain ever in my experience and I have been on so many different medication over the years and up to 8 at one time. I have cut back on almost everything and try my best to live each day dealing with the pain but it does get very depressing but I elected not to stay on anti-depressant for long periods. WARNING: DO NOT allow any doctor to put you on any BENZOS (klonopin_ ativan_ xanax_ valium_ etc) these are diabolical drugs and I learned the hard way what they do to you and how dependent your brain become on them and how long it takes to recover. I feel like they stole 10 years of my life and didn't realize I had changed so much. Google Benzo withdrawal and  go to you tube and you will never do allow a doctor to put you own these. When I was given BENZOs was prior to the internet so the info was not available but the doctors knew back then how bad these drugs were because they have been around since the 1950's and 60's. They lie. Don't lose your life to the Benzos. If you need help with Benzo withdrawal you may email me and I will support you.,F,47,8  years100 mg 3X D,9/7/2012Email,Ultram

57, 4, severe pain from endometriosis,constipation_ drowsiness/dreaminess_ withdrawals (diarrhea and general crappy feeling) if taken continuously for more than 24 hours.,I only take this drug WHEN I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED IT_ and IN ADDITION TO a non-narcotic anti-inflammatory. I recommend it for occasional severe pain_ since it is habit forming and you can quickly build up a tolerance for it_ and withdrawal symptoms are inevitable if you take more than a few doses in a row. When taken as I do_ though_ it is effective at making the worst pain of endometriosis more bearable. If I take it continuously_ though_ my body doesn't get a chance to re-regulate my digestive system and the constipation/diarrhea from withdrawal makes everything worse. Like most drugs it depends on the person_ and it depends on how you use it.,F,26,3  months50 1X D,2/22/2012,Ultram
58, 2, Removed wisdom tooth & abscess.,Dizziness_ Panic/Anxiety Attacks_ Dilated Pupils_ Shallow Breathing_ Extreme Drowsiness_ Inability to fall asleep_ Trouble Urinating.,The first night I took this pill (8pm)_ it worked for a couple of hours and then the pain came back shortly after. I popped an extra one (12am or so) and I was unable to stay asleep. I'd wake up every hour on the hour_ but I was able to fall right back asleep (unless I had to pee_ which took forever to do). Finally_ the next morning I popped another one (8am). By Noon_ I was experiencing the signs of an overdose and ran back to the hospital.,M,22,2  days50 MG 1X D,2/22/2012Email,Ultram
59, 1, for pain,I also take Effexor so my doctor decreaed the effexor. I was good until the fourth week. The sweating was_ terrible_ my hair was wet in the afternoon_ it didn't help my pain_ and it made me really anxious at 200mg a day. I went back to 100mg a day_ and a little less Effexor and I have been fine. The one benifit is the little bit of antidepressent in the med_ so my mood improoved_ so I don't want to stop it .,,M,50,40  days100mg 2X D,2/21/2012,Ultram
