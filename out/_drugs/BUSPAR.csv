0, 1, Anxiety,Took 71/2 mgs for years dr upped it to 30 mg.insomnia 3 days. Sweating. Tight neck aching shoulders terrible anxiety heart pounding tingling.in hand . My guess is he upped it too fast. Decreased it to 5 mg in the morning. I feel the dr wasn't thinking when he upped it so fast .

Why didn't she stop taking the meds!??"" Because onset was slow_ and vaguely noticeable until I ran out of metamucil. Heh? See? Yep_ missed the early signs until it was too late. 2 weeks after stopping buspar_ am on blood pressure meds to induce excretion of liquid buildup/edema in muscles. I can move again and have energy. My anxiety is a little worse_ but frankly I would rather be tightly wound and cognizant_ than fatigued and apathetic. May work for some_ not for me.

4, 5, Anxiety/Panic Disorder,No side effects,Never did I imagine that Buspar would work so well.  I have tried many things for my panic attacks_ which was a daily battle.  Buspar was added partly to boost the lexpro I had been on for a few years and partly the hope of relieving panic/worry.  It made such an incredible difference I was really in shock.  Everything I read made is seem like it wouldn't do much.  But for me it was a miracle.,F,45,1  years10 mg 2X D,7/6/2016,Buspar

It made my anxiety and depression so much worse and improved absolutely nothing. I was supposed to take 2 pills a day but they always made me pass out an hour after taking it. I had to constantly be around people (I'm naturally a loner) so I would go to public place just to be around people even though I didn't know them.

31, 2, Panic Disorder_ GAD,HORRIBLE nausea_ constipation_ dizziness_ pins and needles_ makes anti-depressant withdrawals 10x worse,Helps BRIEFLY_ for maybe 1 hour. But I can't eat anything without feeling sick_ and even without eating I feel sick. I have a phobia of vomit too_ so it's not helping my anxiety in that aspect at all. It's testing the limits of my Zofran. I've lost 6 pounds and I'm now underweight. Within the first 30 mins of taking it I often get dizzy spells and pins and needles that last 1-3 hours. It's bad because I can't really function in this state. It was worse when I was going through antidepressant withdrawals. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION IF YOU ARE GOING THROUGH ANTI-DEPRESSANT WITHDRAWALS!!! The symptoms of withdrawals are the same as the side effects of buspar so you will be miserable. I went up to 15mg twice a day briefly and the side effects just got worse. The first time I was on it I was on 10mg with Lexapro and I didn't feel anything except dizziness. Not a good medication.

37, 1, Anxiety,Bloating_ stomach pain_ paranoia and agoraphobia. Dizzyness_ disorientation_ light sensitivity. Nausea before and after meals.,I started on five mg twice a day. I had some side effects but the only one that bothered me was shaking and nervousness as each dose wore off. Once I increased to ten mg the shaking stopped but I became increasingly paranoid and my stomach started to react to everything I ate. I went back and forth between diahrea and constipation_ sometimes in the same day. The bloating and acid reflux were the worst. It made me look like I was pregnant. All in all it does not work for me. I have historically had bad reactions to medications like this and so I was really hoping this would work for me. But it doesn't. I am stepping down on my own before my check up appointment because it is effecting my ability to do my job. I also am a very physically active person and I haven't been able to run for three weeks because my discomfort is so great. I expect based on other reviews that it will take about a month to really reverse all of my symptoms while I step down gradually as is recommended. Note_ I do not recommend stepping down on your own_ unless you know how to do so safely_ and seeing a doctor as soon as possible once you choose to do so is highly recommended.,F,27,4  weeks10 mg x2,11/9/2015,Buspar

The second week I became sore and more irritable. By the third week I was having a meltdown daily and many more anxiety episodes. I wouldn't get out of bed unless it was for work and I would cry at the thought of leaving the house to go anywhere. I went to the doctor for a three week check up to see how my meds were doing_ and I had gained 11 pounds in those three weeks. The doctor has switched me to Zoloft now and it seems to be helping...I know buspar is great for some people_ and I was really hoping it would work for me considering it's one of the only anti anxiety medications that won't change your personality_ but unfortunately my experience with it was far from successful.,F,20,3  weeks10,8/15/2015Email,Buspar

Headaches lasted nearly all day. dizziness and nausea would fade after about 6 hours.,I know i was on a low dose_ but i really felt that buspar did not help much with my anxiety. i still had lots of panic attacks and nearly went to the hospital on multiple occasions. i just stopped taking it about a week and a half ago because i couldnt bear the headaches. i get migraines easily_ so these headaches morphed into migraines a lot. it may be a good medicine for others_ but it just did not sit well with my body. my body is very sensitive to side effects in general_ and its normal to have headaches and nausea the first 2-3 weeks taking it_ but 6 months in_ that should all be long gone. sorry_ buspar. didn't help much for me.,F,17,6  months20mg 1X D,7/14/2015,Buspar

It did not work for me_ just made symptoms worse especially after stopping the Klonopin. I went up in dosage after 3 weeks from 1x daily at bedtime to 1/2 pill after breakfast & lunch & 1 pill at bedtime_ this made the side effects increase dramatically.

56, 3, GAD_ Social Anxiety_ Bulimia,For the first 30 days I was prescribed 7.5mg of Buspar twice daily. This had no effect_ no side effects. Over the last week I have been taking 10mg twice daily. My Psych said she wants to begin aggressively treating my eating disorder as well and added zoloft 50 mg daily. (I cannot take amphetamines for my eating disorder due to previous addiction) I'm not 100% sure if it's the zoloft or the increased Buspar but I have had EXCRUCIATING headaches_ vivid dreams (which don't particularly bother me)_ sleeplessness_ nausea_ diarrhea which only lasted one day_ extreme irritability_ and increased purging.,My anxiety is slowly beginning to ease. After reading 500+ reviews_ I'm going to stick with it and hope for the best. Most reviews said that the side effects lessen after a few weeks. I will inform my psychiatrist when I see her next Wednesday. Fingers crossed!,F,16,38  days10 2X D,4/8/2015,Buspar

58, 5, GAD_ BPD_ MDD,Dizziness when increasing dose to 60mg/day.Other side effects may be any of my three meds_ so I can't say for sure that the dry mouth_ sleep problems or night sweats are solely the shopping of buspar.,It's been extremely effective for my awful anxiety.  I'm taking this along with Seroquel (200mg 50_50_100) and Welbutrin xl 300mg.  I began taking it at 30mg twice a day in January_ and upon my visit on April 1_ I was able to report that this addition had successfully helped a key component of my struggles--high anxiety for no reason and anticipation anxiety.Before being on buspar_ I had made significant gains with many of my bpd symptoms (anger_ frequent mood changes_ depression_ self harm etc).  But I had made very little gain in alleviating my anxiety until I began Buspar.  For the first time in a long time I am able to live a day at a time_ with no extreme anxiety over where things are going and what's down the road.  That's a freedom I have yet to experience in a long_ long time.  This combination has reduced my mood swings to general agitation and irritability_ and my psych seems to believe that increasing my dose to 60 will help with those symptoms and possibly help with sleep.,M,31,3  months60 (20 3x),4/2/2015Email,Buspar
59, 5, Generalized Anxiety,Increased anxiety for the first week. Gradually better after week 2. Compared to other meds Buspar has been great for me. No side effects after the second week.,Works great! Takes the edge off and doesn't make you a zombie like other meds. My mind is clear and I'm calm_ haven't felt this way in 15 years. Buspar gets a bad wrap mostly because people don't give it a chance to work (at least 30 days). It is NOT a benzo!! It doesn't offer instant relief. I used Ativan during the first 2 weeks as needed for panic attacks. Once the Buspar kicked in i no longer needed Ativan.,M,36,2  months15mg 2X D,3/23/2015,Buspar
