0, 2, Corneal Abrasion,I was given this to help alleviate pain for a corneal abrasion. Not only was it impossible to get this prescribed filled (it has to be specially ordered)_ but it didn't do anything to help with the pain. All it does is dilate your eye and blur your vision. I think this was a poor medicinal recommendation from the doctor. Not only that but I only used one drop in my infected eye and the blurred vision and dilated eye lasted for four days. The drug pamphlet does say that the effects may last several days for certain people. Well I was one of those people and I must say it's a real pain. I recommend that if you take this product that you prepare yourself for the fact that you may need to take off of work for a few days until your eye gets better (especially if you work with computers). I don't think the medicine is worth it_ to say the least. I will never use it again.,,F,25,1  days.5% 1X D,1/30/2011Email,Cyclogyl
