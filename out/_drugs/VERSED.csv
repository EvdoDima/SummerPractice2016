0, 1, celiac plexus block,"Went in to get a celiac plexus block. Was given three doses of versed. Kept telling the docs that I was fully awake_ aware_ and very anxious because what they were doing hurt considerably. I have been put under for multiple procedures_ and know the point when you are starting to go ""out."" This never occurred. They just kept repeating that I was fine and I would ""forget everything."" To which I kept reiterating that I would not and the versed wasn't working. They might as well have given me water in my IV. I ended up jumping off of the table in pain_ and had to leave.My main doctor's office that referred me to have the procedure kept telling me that there's no way I would remember anything.Wish that was the case. Would not recommend.",,F,29,1  days,8/8/2016,Versed

9, 1, For a biopsy of my liver,I woke up twice during the procedure_ screaming with pain. I kept telling them to give me more Fentanyl. Post-biopsy I had very elevated systolic blood pressure & increased heart rate.  I also had difficulty breathing & could not get a deep breath.  The night of the procedure I awoke with pain every time I took a breath_ & felt I was not getting any full breath's.  The next morning I started experiencing severe muscle cramping in my feet & calves. They were very prolonged & I had to stretch out of every one. I also felt very dizzy & lightheaded for a couple of days. The drug also caused extreme nausea & I am sure would have ended in vomiting had I not been taking Zofran.  I had also experienced waking up in excruciating pain during a previous colonoscopy.  I believe that because of the amnesiac effects_ the nurse both times gave far lower doses the f pain medication than was necessary for the procedure.  After looking up all the side effects of this drug_ & having experienced nearly all of them_ Zi will refuse to ever have this drug used on me again. It was a horrible experience both times_ & remembering the pain from the previous procedure 10 years earlier_ I should have refused the drug this time.,I will never allow Versed to be used again on myself_ nor anyone I know. The ironic thing is I am a critical care nurse & had used this drug many times for conscious sedation. In the future_ I will not participate in any procedures using Versed.,F,58,1  days?,3/27/2016Email,Versed

11, 1, Sedation for surgery,Had versed 5 times for surgery . Can't remember how I heard about versed but looked it up. The last surgery I said no to versed. I can tell before the first surgery I could do numbers in my head_ Remember what I said yesterday_ Figure volumes and amount of product I needed in my head. I was a builder. Now can't remember crap_ short term memory. Versed is the only drug that could have caused my memory problems. Its coming back slowly_ It was 2 years since I have been versed. I'm telling you_ SAY NO to VERSED>,SAY NO TO VERSED_ and ask when they say this will just calm you down what is is and ask how does it work.

14, 5, Surgery,None,They gave me versed right before my surgery. It made me very calm_ when I had previously been nervous.

15, 1, Hip Replacement Surgery,I was given Versed before_ during and after my hip replacement surgery.  I remember nothing including the surgeon seeing me after surgery to discuss complications and what I could and couldn't do.  The surgeon visited me the next day and told me again and yet I couldn't remember.  It took 6 days before I could comprehend and remember the complications and not continue to hurt myself.,It's now been 17 weeks today since my surgery.  I don't know if it's a result of the Versed_ the sick feeling of being unable to remember and what may have happened or what but I am severely depressed.  I have no reason to be depressed_ I caused no damage by not remembering what I was not to do because of the complications.  I am healed and in great shape.  No more hip pain_ but I am soooo depressed that I am now seeking professional help.  I've never been like this before.  I am not suicidal at this point but I don't want to live.,M,63,1  timesunknown 1X D,3/16/2016Email,Versed

24, 5, histeroscopy D&C with spinal anesth,"Lack of balance during recovery. Mild ""hangover"" for a few days.",I feel that I owe my satisfaction with the drug almost entirely to the very considerate and sensitive treatment I received from everyone concerned; they gave me full information about all the options in a preop visit and respected my choices. I was extremely frightened about having a surgical procedure as a result of various terrible experiences_ and I chose to have a spinal because I wanted to be awake but I didn't want to feel anything. I said they could give me Versed only if I explicitly asked for it. As my lower body became numb I began to feel some anxiety that I could not move my legs. I asked for a little Versed while I listened to music on my cell phone. From there on the experience was positively pleasant. I don't think I lost consciousness and I didn't feel it as a loss of control. Recovery was fine_ although my balance was a little off and I had a bit of a hangover the next morning. But the overall experience was great. Maybe another time I would take less or none if I felt less afraid. I would never choose conscious sedation alone for a painful procedure_ I would just take it for the associated anxiety.,F,65,1  days 1X D,1/31/2016,Versed
25, 1, Cervical Epidural Steroid inj.,"Versed did not work for me at all. I felt the Doc fishing around in my neck with the needle_ heard crunching when he hit several bones_and heard the Doctor say ""God dammit I can't get at the f - ing epidural space""! Finally_ I felt a red hot pain when he stabbed a nerve so I cried out and flinched... that was when the Doc started shouting ""Give her more Versed_ give her more Versed_ give her more Versed. I should point out that I'm 5'7"" and weigh 110lb; I shouldn't have needed a dose large enough for a horse. I do not take any meds that would increase metabolism of benzos_nor am I tolerant of benzos (one 5mg Diazepam tab will make me loopy for 3 days).

26, 2, colonoscopy and endoscopy,I felt everything during the colonoscopy.  I felt as if the doctor was impatient with me and just wanted the procedure to be done.

27, 1, lumbar injections & nerve burning,No reduction in pain. Muscle spasms for 12-14hrs after each dose_ I continue to have fuzzy/foggy thinking_ struggle to find words and just space out sometimes with no memory of the current event. These things are still happening on a daily basis.,Over the last 5 yrs I have had versed for lumbar injections 3 times_ before undergoing nerve burning procedures in the lower lumbar 2 times and for the placement of a trial stimulator in the spine. Example: last procedure: I can remember everything...even the conversation the doc and nurses were having about their plans to go to Disney for the holidays. The pain was excruciating!!! I cried and screamed out during the whole procedure and had a death grip on the bed trying not to jerk...they are dinking with my spine after all_ and was literally begging the doc to stop all while being told to be still! After the trial implant I can remember all of the pain_ had muscle spasms for 14 hrs straight but I don't remember the drive home. I have not had any benefit from this drug. The problems it has caused are terrible. I wasn't told there were any long term effects with the drug what so ever. I was told I would be awake and I would not have any memory of the procedures. WHAT A LOAD OF BULL!! Oh I was awake for sure and I remember every ounce of pain.  My primary care provider expressed concern about my ever having it again due to the problems with thinking and memory it has caused. I received the drug from the pain clinic that treats my chronic pain and fatigue. Sometimes I wonder why they would ever dispense versed like it is as benign as a tic tac when it's so very dangerous!,F,40,1  days?? unsure,12/11/2015Email,Versed

30, 1, Endoscopy,Amnesia. This drug is an AMNESTIC. Not a pain killer_ and not as similar to Valium or Ativan as they'd have you believe.,"Versed is given to patients so that they become compliant and later forget the procedure. It is often used so that doctors can cut corners on pain meds_ because patients will not remember the pain they were in. It is given sneakily_ with manipulation_ against patient orders and with UNINFORMED ""consent"". For anxiety_ they could give Valium_ and for the pain_ they could give adequate amounts of Fentanyl. It's horrific_ if you read up on it. Wiping the memories of patients after you've put them in pain is immoral and deplorable.",,,  1X D,11/10/2015Email,Versed
31, 1, endoscopy procedure,Memory loss is indeed an intended result but one patients are seldom told about.  They want you to think you were asleep or unconscious_ free from pain. Not always true.

Has these symptoms for about 1/2 hour.  Then slowly regained control.  Had my Personal Care Assistant there.  If did not have some one with me would have been so very scared.

39, 1, D&C,Totally passed out when I had informed the Anesthesiologist that I did NOT want to be asleep. Was given this with spinal block. I have no memory of the operation_ only remember waking (waking? was never supposed to be asleep!) in the recovery room with a HORRIBLE headache_ dizziness_ grogginess_ shivering_ etc. It took HOURS for this to lessen to the point where I could even lift my arms and legs!,3 days later and I am still sleeping like I have been drugged. I can hardly stay awake_ have confusion_ inability to think (or remember things_ sorry for my spelling mistakes!). Tinnitus is HORRIBLE. I had informed the staff that I had problems with ALL anesthesia_ but I guess they just didnt really give a ----. I wanted to stay awake_ and my wishes were not granted_ my 'side effects' are worse than the whole reason I was having the operation in the first place!NEVER will allow this to be given to me in the future_ I will die first.,F,49,  1X D,8/14/2015,Versed

44, 1, Anesthetic used for an EGD,"I sat up after receiving versed_ pulled the endoscope hose out. Climbed over the bed railing_ said a few choice words to the people around me_ got dressed and walked out followed by security. My husband was surprised as it had been about 10 minutes since they had taken me in for the procedure. I came to at home_ asked_ ""Why am I here?"" I only barely remember the movement of pulling out the endoscope tube. The doctor tried to blame me for the reaction to this drug and I felt that it was the doctors fault that the could have given me a mild sedative (such as Valium or similar) to calm me down. Obviously I will never let them use Versed again.",I would not recommend this drug to anyone who is having surgery.

47, 1, EGD/Hospitalization,"There needs to be a -150 rating for this drug.  Memory loss - days later and recurring_ not when administered. Half-days and such would just ""disappear"". Anxiety_ panic attacks_ nightmares. flashbacks_ recurrent PTSD.  Weird memory lapses_ as in looking straight at something and unable to come up with the word. Extreme anger and ""grudge"" reactions - the day after dose 3 I basically attacked a well-liked and well-known alternative practitioner for no reason at all and still haven't completely shaken it off.",I was hospitalized for six days and had 3 EGDs - month apart. Arriving at the hospital half-bled-out was not as traumatic as how the hospital staff behaved when they thought I wouldn't remember_ or the weird and completely unpredictable memory loss and lapses. The 6mg was given legitimately and with consent for the emergency EGD - but the staff kept slipping it to me as they were constantly told not to (and for no legitimate reason). I left the hospital in BAD shape. It happens that I have long-managed PTSD and wasn't surprised that it had flared up again_ considering_ only to resume putting it back in it's place with some really good help_ just to find whole new sets of problems directly created by the Versed and the incredibly evil behaviors that it spawns in the healthcare industry.  So much for trusting hospitals or anyone in them again ... even with really good help_ it's taken six months (with bi-weekly treatment or more_ since the last dose of Versed).  A really good acupuncturist with adrenaline disorder and addiction experience who's willing to work with you and lay down a grounding cognitive framework can REALLY help - but very hard to find and prohibitively expensive if you can't get it covered under a good long-term mental health benefit.,F,50,1  months6 mg IV 1X M,7/3/2015,Versed

51, 5, Colonoscopy,I had my second colonoscopy today. The doctor combined versed with demerol. I wish they had started the demerol sooner to help me relax but they didn't. I have a real high tolerance for this drug and nitrous oxide. The first colonoscopy 9 years ago I woke up twice_ but not this time. I was mildly conscious the entire procedure which only took 20 minutes. I asked the doctor to increase dosage and he did. I was very happy with the results although I wish he would have used propofol because of the euphoria effect. Having used versed and other conscious sedation drugs over the past few years_ I recommend versed without question but still like propofol and some of the other oral conscious sedation meds too!,,M,64,1  days 1X D,6/1/2015,Versed

53, 5, EGD,I have been given this twice. Once several years ago for a colonoscopy and today for an EGD. I was completely unaware of either procedure.,From reading comments it seems that how well it works depends on what they give you with it. I had versed initially and then propofol. My throat is a little sore and they use gas to kind of blow you up while they are looking around so I've had some gas pains. Other than that I was able to eat right away and actually not struggle to swallow since they stretched my esophagus.  It was well worth going through this procedure to be able to eat normally.,F,44,1  days,5/15/2015,Versed

I was told that the combination of versed and fentanyl would keep me out of pain_ partially sedate me_ and I would have no memory of it afterwards. Well_ they were wrong. It was extremely painful_ and I remember the whole_ excruciating ordeal. It was like I had nothing. My blood pressure went up_ and I had no trouble with respirations. I did not feel sleepy at all.

56, 3, colonoscopy/endoscopy,People react differently. All 4 of us (siblings) had this procedure. One can remember the whole thing and some pain but not bad_ one thinks it was awesome. Lol. and the other one thinks the endoscopy part was horrible. I had mine done yesterday and have chaotic memories of moving my legs in pain_ screaming_ gagging_ people talking to me. I think they gave me extra during because of this. Last thing I remember is yelping in pain during the colonoscopy part and then staring at the doctor looking at a screen and then a nurse putting a really warm blanket on me after and thinking it felt so good. It's not a drug where you feel like you have any control whatsoever. When I get my next one in 3 Years_ I'll take it again but this time_ I want enough that I remember nothing. It was pretty crazy. Felt wobbly after and don't remember calling my husband or talking to my mom on the phone. Definitely have someone waiting for you as soon as you're done because you can feel pretty confused. I felt like crying when I was dressed and left in the waiting room after and my husband wasn't there for 5 minutes to get me (Apparently that's the phone call I don't remember and I was pretty irritated with him...lol) I think I felt upset because it's a vulnerable feeling. They definetely don't give you a lot of recovery time and I think they should let you stay in a bed until someone comes to get you...being in a waiting room with people stating at me and feeling totally drugged did not feel good.,,F,35,1  days,4/30/2015,Versed
