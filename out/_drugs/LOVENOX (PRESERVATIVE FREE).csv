19, 2, Dvt_Ovt and pregnancy,Extreme hematomas_ pain_ and tenderness at the injection site. Have had to receive stitches for severe bleeding at injection site.  Mild nausea and vomiting. I was on arixtra for almost 2 years with no problems_ due to not becoming therapeutic on warfarin 6 months prior. Arixtra was perfect for me and the reason I had to switch to lovenox was due to my pregnancy. I have had 3dvts in my legs_ and 1 massive dvt on my ovary_ all of which while taking warfarin. I would recommend arixtra to anyone currently on lovenox because of less side effects. As I became further along in my pregnancy_ pinching skin was harder than ever_ and I was allowed other injection sites besides my stomach_ but with the same results_ horrible hematomas that required stitches. Very disapointed with this drug_ mainly because I've seen how blood thinners don't have to interfere with your daily life. For everyone who reads this and is dissatisfied with lovenox_ but doesnt know of anything better_ ask your doctor about arixtra!,,F,28,9  months120mg,1/1/2012Email,Lovenox (preservative free)

Minimal bruising (so far).,I found it helps out with minimizing the bruising if you sit down_ grab your stomach fat and put the needle in at a 90 degree angle vs. laying down and doing it.I miscarried after 3 months and the oncologist is hoping that this will help.  I knew I had factor V_ but didn't know about the other one until he retested me for a bunch.

To continue taking I spaced at 18 hrs.beginning w/the fifth dose. 2)at 2 weeks (spaced at 18 hrs.) experienced intense arthritis throughout my body. Have continued with 24 hr spacing.,I also have had bruising_ headaches and fatigue. This drug has a half life of 12 hours and stays in an average person's body for 96 hrs.or more. so each additional dose increases the concentration.

Itchy red rash_ worse all over abdomen_ spreading to my scalp_ legs_ arms_ crotch...horrible!,The rash went away within two days after stopping Lovenox.  Luckily my INR was in therapeutic range and I will be able to continue on Coumadin only.  My fear is that I will develop another clot...hope I am not allergic to drugs similar to Lovenox(like heparin).  The injections were not pleasant.

49, 4, Antiphospholipid Syndrome,"Bruising_ hematomas_ soreness until I experimented and became adept at giving myself the shots. Anyone who complains of these things would be wise to experiment and ask several nurses to demonstrate proper technique. I noticed someone here saying things improved for them AFTER they began pinching the skin while giving the injection. No subcutaneous should EVER be given without pinching the site. There's no way to avoid bruising and huge lumps if you aren't pinching the skin at the injection site. Those who complain of the liquid being ""painful"" need to pinch tighter.  Done correctly_ there is virtually no pain associated with this injection unless you happen to hit some nerves.  In this case_ pull out and move slightly.",Give the injection slowly. Count to 30 quickly while giving the injection slowly -- very slowly. Always pinch the skin. When finished_ hold the needle where it is and count to 5 quickly.  Pull it out a little and count to 10 quickly.  Then slowly remove it the rest of the way.  NEVER rub the injection site BEFORE or AFTER giving yourself the injection.  You'll bruise heavily_ get hematomas_ and experience pain as a result.  This really should be no big deal. If it is_ you're doing it wrong.,F,54,1  years120 mg 2X D,3/27/2010Email,Lovenox (preservative free)

Slightly more rapid heartbeat 10 mins or so after injection - could be anxiety/paranoia? Tiny bit of bleeding after injecting.,DVT after longhaul flight from Hawaii_ to London Heathrow_ then Newcastle in close succession_ had recently taken birth control pill dianette at time. Now pregnant Lovenox offered as precaution given my history. Instructed to inject on side of thigh_ not belly- started treatment at 23 weeks pregnant and will continue until 24 hrs before birth and afterwards also I expect as post=partum DVT just as much as a risk I heard.

I am currently taking 15mg of coumadin daily as well along with the Lovenox 100mg twice a day.  We are having a difficult time making my blood levels theraputic.I noticed if you ice the area down before and after the needle it hurts much less and the stingy doesn't last as long.",M,33,11  days,8/10/2009Email,Lovenox (preservative free)
59, 4, DVT/ PE/ Rare Blood Disorder,I dont feel anything like myself_ low energy_ Axienty_ cant sleep at night(dont go to bed till about 1 a.m.)_ sore stomach_ the injections hurt because of how thick the liquid is_ when you clean the area with the alcohol let the area dry first before injecting_ it wont hurt as much.  I am also on Coumadin taking 15mg a day regardless of if I have to give myself shots,Because i have a rare blood disorder (less then 1% of the population have it) i am required to have my INR tested twice a week right now_ when its where it should be i dont have to give myself shots_ but i find the side effects are more apparent_ i have only been off them for a day so far_ next week i go back to get my blood tested to see if my INR is still where it should be if not i have to take shots_ Im taking Coumadin as well and it seems that when im not on the shots the symptoms are worse.  I am a Lifer of these two drugs_ something im going to look into is a Homeopathy item called ARNICA MOTANA_ its made from a plant and when taken oraly it CAN help with blood clots and work with Coumadin_ im going to take what i found to my Doctor and get his take on it. Who knows if it will help but what the hell right?,M,21,3  weeks,7/21/2009,Lovenox (preservative free)
