2, 4, Pulmonary embolism while on coumade,Only improvements.  The worst side effects were the family doc-tors who failed to research before writing a prescription and were afraid to give SUFFICIENT dosage.  Also_ family doctors blocking a referral to a specialist_ where I ultimately got the required dosage increase.  ,It is very cruel to expect a sick person to take a pill every  6 hours!  When does the body rest?  Taking it every 8 hours is much better.  Also_ since your literature says up to 400 mg. daily_ why are most doctors unwilling to prescribe more than 200 mg. daily.  This is a wonder drug that seems to be being saved for the chosen few.  I believe it has many more applications than even it's maker is making known.  Guess we stop the money machine rolling if we cure too much at once_ right?,F,56,4000  days,12/27/2001Email,Persantine
