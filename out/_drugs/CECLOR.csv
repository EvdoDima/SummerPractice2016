1, 1, Bronchitis,I took this medication and started breaking out in hives almost immediately and have done so for over a year now.  I asked my doctor about the side effects and how long they would last_ he said he did not know.  There is nothing I can do for the hives and there seems to be no cure for them.  I would certainly NOT recommend this drug_ my life is miserable now and there is no relief in site.,I have completely discontinued usage.,F,30,1  months,11/16/2009,Ceclor
