0, 1, Acid Reflux,After taking it for only 2 days I woke up with awful dizziness_ I never had that happen before and can only think it had to be from Pepcid. Will not take it again_ too scary!,,F,61,2  days,6/9/2016,Pepcid ac

2, 1, GERD and heartburn,Dizziness_ shakiness_ lightheadedness_ inability to think_ heart palpitations_ very loud tinnitis_ migraines_ severe anxiety_ depression_ stomach pain_ sometimes explosive diarrhea_ sensitivity to higher temperatures.,Pepcid is the only medicine I've taken for 10 years and in the last 3 I began to notice the symptoms I've mentioned were getting worse and it could only be the Pepcid. Otherwise I am very healthy. My doctor was clueless and said that it couldn't be the Pepcid. I had lots of tests_ all of which came back normal.  I tried to stop taking it several times_ but the rebound heartburn made me go to back to it. The symptoms of dizziness and anxiety made me try again and again to get off of it. It was just awful. I couldn't function at all!  I felt like a zombie.  It's been 3 weeks and I'm beginning to see a difference. It took 5 days for the diarrhea to stop_ 14 days for the dizziness to stop. I'm still shaky at times_ but not nearly as bad as I was 3 weeks ago. Palpitations_ migraines_ loud tinnitis and anxiety are still with me but slowly going away. I would recommend that if you are on Pepcid_ slowly wean yourself off over a period of weeks.  I decided to go cold turkey and I'm sorry I did. The rebound heartburn is not as bad now as the first 2 weeks_ but it is still there.  Heartburn with meals or between meals was constant_ now it is lessening.  I am using Rolaids mostly_ but have found a 1 tsp of baking soda in water works great_ too. I can't believe how much better I feel all over.  If you are on Pepcid_ get off it now.,F,62,10  years20mg 2X D,7/23/2015,Pepcid ac
3, 4, Heartburn,Occasionally causes tenderness and pain in a specific area of my abdomen. Vivid and bizarre dreams are the main side effect. These dreams can continue for several days after taking Famotidine.,This is the best drug I have taken for heartburn. One dose lasts for ~24hrs. I am concerned about the side effects. I only take this drug on those occasions when I have severe heartburn. For me_ it's best to avoid overeating and avoid foods that cause heartburn.,M,54,2  days10 1X D,9/22/2014,Pepcid ac

6, 1, Allergic reaction to food,Pepcid and other drugs in the same class are used to block H2 histamine along with antihistamines and steroids. Pepcid caused me to feel extremely anxious_ mentally foggy_ and also caused heart arrhythmias_ swings in pulse and blood pressure_ and general discomfort.,It took nearly a full week for the side effects to wear off. If I should need a drug like this again_ I will ask for a different one.,F,53,6  days20 mg 1X D,3/19/2013Email,Pepcid ac
7, 1, GERD,Pepcid AC helped me with my acid reflux_ but at first I didn't realize it but the drug made highly aggressive.  I found myself getting angry easily.  By the end of the second week I was out of control and could not concentrate on my designs.  It wasn't until I slammed my laptop and knocked over my computer tower did I realize something was wrong at work.  A close friend mentioned that I was acting weird and had been trying to avoid me.  I stopped taking the medication.  The next day I went from feeling as if I could take on 5 guys at once to tearing up at random times.  It was an emotional roller coaster ride.  I also lost almost total concentration by the 2nd week.  I could not focus on anything for any length of time.  It turned me into a monster.  My coworker did not want to get in the car with me or go to lunch because he said I was like the incredible hulk with severe anger.  I would even wake up angry for no apparent reason.  Had stayed on the medication for any longer amount of,,M,37,2  weeks 2X D,6/12/2012,Pepcid ac
8, 3, GERD,Ringing in ears_ dizziness_ bizarre dreams_ wheezing/asthma,Unfortunately_ I stopped taking this drug because of the difficulties breathing I have experienced (aggravated asthma condition).  It did a wonderful job clearing up my upper GI issues. I could tolerate the other side effects.  The dreams were kind of fun.,F,60,2  weeks40 mg 1X D,9/2/2011Email,Pepcid ac
9, 4, GERD,Drowsiness,Worked well to suppress acid.  But_ I had to take sublingual B complex_ to combat the drowsiness.,F,47,5  months10 mg 1X D,10/5/2010,Pepcid ac

11, 5, Frequent Bad Heartburn/GERD,No side effects at all.,This stuff works like a miracle. I have noticed the effect not lasting as long as it used to when I first started taking it_ but that's the only bad thing I can say about it.,F,42,14  years 1X D,6/1/2010,Pepcid ac

13, 1, gerd,racing heart_ tremor_ anxiety_ throat constriction_ dizziness,Worked well for my GERD but couldn't stand the side effects. Tried Prilosec_ Protonix_ Aciphex_ Nexium - same thing.  Finally stopped everything (mistake - I should have tapered off) and had a very difficult week!  It took 4-5 days for the heart pounding to stop_ and almost a week to stop shaking. Now I'm trying lifestyle changes and orange peel extract.,F,52,4  weeks,12/27/2008,Pepcid ac
14, 4, GERD_ Acid Reflux,I felt immediatelly better taking Pepcid but I began having VERY intense_ detailed and extremly disturbing dreams. It almost made me want to quit. I will continue to take it but if the symptoms persist I may have to find an alternate solution. These were awful dreams.,,F,29,4  days,6/17/2008,Pepcid ac
15, 3, Dyspepsia,Anxiety,It helped tremendously my dyspepsia_ but I could not handle the side effects.,M,22,6  days,2/1/2008,Pepcid ac
16, 4, Gastritis,Bad taste in my mouth,I felt a slight reduction in stomach burning after a few hours of taking_ but even with the maximum strength 20mg twice per day_ it took 2-3 days before I felt like it really started to eliminate my gastritis.,M,30,7  days,7/20/2007,Pepcid ac
17, 2, acid reflux,SEVERE MEMORY LOSS i took this drug for 6 years. by the time i was 31 years old and i was frustrated with memory loss. my doctor took me off this drug and within one month i could tell a huge difference. he payed attention to my complaint because i was so young. i think older people's complaint would be brushed off.,if you are experiencing unexplained memeory loss try going off this drug and using prilosec otc instead.,F,35,6  years,4/9/2007,Pepcid ac
18, 1, GERD,none because it does nothing,pepcid ac does nothing at all. zantac is a much better H2 blocker and prevacid is obviously better. got incredible heartburn and acid indigestion,M,21,21  days,11/18/2005,Pepcid ac
19, 4, GERD,Joint pain and stomach aches after eating (during the first week or two of treatment.)  This subsided with continued use.  Brief heart palpitations shortly after taking higher doses (>40mg).,I've had to increase the dose over time because my body seems to develop a tolerance to this medication.  I take 40 to 60mg fifteen to thirty minutes prior to a meal and 40 to 60mg at bedtime.  It works_ but I have to keep increasing the dose.  I did read that you can take up to 160mg every 6 hours as that is the maximum dose.  I've heard of horror stories from people on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) so I'll max out the dose on Pepcid before I'll even consider a PPI.,M,33,6  months,8/27/2005,Pepcid ac
20, 4, chronic acid reflux,Possibly Bloating however this may be the disease itself.,As soon as I am even half an hour late taking medicine symptoms arise. Tablets are only a complete sucess when I have regular meal breaks and medication routinely.,F,25,3  years,7/4/2005,Pepcid ac
