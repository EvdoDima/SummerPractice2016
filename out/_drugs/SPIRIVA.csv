6, 4, Severe Emphysema,I think most of my side effects are from Symbicort but weight gain_ heart burn_ headache_ Urinary issues at times...,Spiriva seems like it helps a lot. Most side effects I noticed happened after adding Symbicort to my Spiriva.

8, 2, COPD_ on O2 and use othere inhalers,Can't diagnose _ but I can say that since I've been on Spiriva my eyes are getting very  blurry_   (use to get blurry only when I needed to use my inhaler)_  have gained terrible belly weight_ my normal daily bowel habits are now every other day with constipation and gas_ I was hospitalized for a blocked small intestine_ my breathing hasn't improved much and my sleeping is now intermittent.,I've wondered why so many things have changed all at one time - I was doing well and becoming more active.Now I've lost all I've gained and feel unwell.  Never would have guessed till I read so many similar complaints by others with equal  changes and symptoms.,F,64,1  years18mcg 1X D,10/11/2014,Spiriva
9, 1, Recommended by a doctor for COPD,The first symptoms were severe lower back pain_ along with dry mouth and eyes. The back pain became so severe that I started feeling nauseated_ along with dizzy spells and blurred vision. Then I experienced daily abdominal pains due to constipation. At first I didn't associate it with the medication_ but after three weeks the constipation got out of control. The pain became so severe that I finally passed out in the bathroom. The bowel movement was anything but normal; first hard_ then diarhea_ and finally blood - all symptoms of an intestinal blockage. It's been two weeks now since I've taken Spiriva_ and all the above symptoms have disappeared.,I would strongly advise against taking this drug! Make sure you read about the list of side affects_ which is a mile long. It mentions constipation_ but it does not warn that it may cause an intestinal blockage.,F,54,21  days 1X D,9/19/2014Email,Spiriva
10, 5, COPD,So far no adverse side affects. And a huge improvement in breathing. I am a Vietnam Vet. With a heart transplant diagnosis to deal with since 2008. Also COPD being for many years a smoker. Anyway being 100 pct disabled and housebound. But with all the sad things in the news about VA healthcare. They as a whole have saved my life. Over the past 6 yrs saved my life. Have a fantastic caring primary care doctor. And converse with him and his staff mostly on a site called my health vet. And my responce time is rapid. So in reference to the COPD. He gave me Spirava and yes very new to useing it. But can breath better than I have in years. So god bless the VA and the care for a heart that barely works. 3 heart surgeries in 5 years. So needless to say one of the side affects is heart pain. I welcome it_ compared to all I've experienced since 08. And so far can breath much much better. Thanks for all the health help I've gotten from the great health care employees at the VA with a endless job in front of them. Good luck to those who may read this.        Thanks,,M,59,3  days30mg,7/23/2014Email,Spiriva

16, 5, Stage 3 COPD,Backpain_ thirst.  Occasional leg pain (sharp stabbing pain coming from nowhere...goes away in as little as 10 seconds_ sometimes 20-30 minutes.)  Use heating pad for backache_ and drink a lot of water for the thirst. Livable side effects_ IMO.,Taking Spiriva in conjunction with Daliresp...astounding improvement: went from 88 on resting blood oxygen level to just about normal (reading of 94)  Even on mild exertion_ it only fell to 89. I can walk for 10 minutes without getting short of breath.  I can actually talk a little while walking!  I go about normal household tasks without taking a break every 5 minutes.   I don't wake up short of breath in middle of the night. Yes_ there's a few side effects_ but so far I can deal with those just fine.  I am dieting_ and have lost weight without difficulty so not getting the weight gain issues at all.  Have COPD...quit smoking 8 years ago but apparently I inherited bad lungs so got the COPD even though I quit  (and have never worked in a chemical-type industry or town either.),F,56,2  months18 MG 1X D,6/26/2012Email,Spiriva
