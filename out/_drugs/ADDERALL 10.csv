0, 4, Motivation_ energy,minor headaches_ fatigue_ unmotivated,Firstly_ please don?t be scared off by the neg reviewers here. YES you should definitely take them into consideration_ but most of them act as if these neg affects are guaranteed for everybody. I don?t need to get scientific because I can tell you my own experience. I have been taking adderall since I was 19. (I?ll be 30 next month.) I started in college like a lot of people bc I needed to be focused. For me_ once I was done with finals_ or even during summer break_ I would stop taking it since I didn?t ?need? it. I was perfectly fine. This cont. for a couple years. After I was done with college I stopped taking it for about a year. My entire life_ I was an insomniac and also naturally very lazy in general. Then I got my first job as a Paralegal at a Law Firm. I decided to get back on adderall so that I would start off kicking butt. I took it regularly (One 20 mg a day) for about a year or so. BC I was safe in my position I decided to get off of it. About 6 mo. after THAT_ I switched jobs to another law firm_ so I got BACK on it. Currently_ I am still at my job and I have been on it regularly since then. What I do_ is break my 20 mg pill in half and take 10 mg in the morning_ and then if I need it again later after work_ which I usually will in order to not nap when I get home_ Ill take the other half. Then_ I ?crash? from the adderall around 10 PM or so_ so it?s easy for me to go to sleep! I take it every day (incl wknds),F,29,9  years20MG 2X D,8/8/2016Email,Adderall 10
1, 4, Motivation_ energy,minor headaches_ fatigue_ unmotivated,(cont from prev box) the actual effects of adderall will wear off after consistently using it. When this happens_ I have to stop taking it for a week or so and then when I take it again_ the effects come back. Another neg effect I sometimes get is a minor headache when I get home from work. But I either just ride it out or take a small dose of buffered aspirin. Or smoke some weed. (It?s 2016 and it DOES help without adding more chemicals to my body.) I will also get dry mouth a lot but I am AWFUL about drinking water anyway! The pos effects are being extremely motivated. It ensures that I don?t mess ANYTHING up for a client and get everything done in a timely manner. There are many days I do not take it (bc I forgot it_ or my boss won?t be in all week and it?s an easy week_ etc.) and I def notice that I will goof off more instead of getting prepared like I do when I?m on adderall. I also have a tendency to overlook errors when I?m not on it. When I?m on it_ I literally think of everything_ double check anything I do_ am more than prepared_ and think outside the box. I consider myself a pretty intelligent person to begin with_ but it?s as if adderall makes me even smarter. I am normally a very shy introvert. When I?m on adderall_ I am much livelier_ not afraid to make conversation_ and I am very assertive and quick. After almost 10 yrs of taking it pretty regularly_ I do not experience any of the side effects other people h,F,29,9  years20 MG 1X D,8/8/2016Email,Adderall 10

5, 5, ADHD_ MOOD DO NOS,No side effects I can tell. Perhaps mild nervousness or impatience,Adderall has helped me greatly with my focus at work and energy levels in running errands. It gives me a lot of get-up-and-go. I was on Vyvanse_ which though it worked somewhat_ can't hold a candle to Adderall. I read of a way to jumpstart my Adderall and get more out of it_ and ran this idea past my doctor_ who said biologically it makes sense: Take 2-3 Tums tablets with your Adderall and it will last longer and you will feel its effects stronger. I do not know the exact science_ but a more basic stomach environment helps the drug be better absorbed. And this makes sense given people are told not to drink citrus juices with their Adderall -- they dampen its effects. When the penny drops_  Adderall has it all over many other ADHD medications (Vyvanse_ dextroamphetamine)_ because it contains two amphetamine salts: dex for mental focus_ and lev for physical energy. With many drugs_ I say the oldie but goodies are better than the new fangled ones put on the market to pump up drug makers' profits. Adderall is a classic. Ritalin is a classic_ too_ but my week on that made me want to become a hermit. For my buck (and sanity)_ it's ADDERALL.,F,38,60  days20 2X D,6/18/2016Email,Adderall 10

9, 1, ADHD,Chronic fatigue_ autoimmune disease (RA). Fibromyalgia. Adderall induced depression.,There is a reason there are no long-term studies on this drug. After 5-6 years of taking Adderall XR 30 mg and 10 mg later in the day_ taking days off from Adderall was not an option. Because on my 'days off' I never moved from the couch_ had zero energy and slept like I hadn't slept in years_ so I basically 'needed' it everyday for energy. Soon I started not being able to get out of bed without it. I worked full time_ went to college_ and raised my kids_ bought my own home_ etc. After Twenty + years of Adderall_ one morning after laying in bed waiting for the Adderall to kick in_ nothing happened_ but I decided to get up anyway. Only when I got up_ I could not even move my leg to walk. I knew all the years of taking this artificial energy my body could not produce one ounce on its own. I was done. The gig was up. I laid in bed for a year. Lost my job_ lost my house. I slept and slept and slept. This drug is working with your body to give it energy_ in excess. Don't for one minute think there won't be a price to pay_ because there is. It robs your immune system. The reason there are no long term studies on this drug is because when adverse reactions began appearing_ the study ended. There is no profit in bad drugs. Don't fool yourself into believing there is no harm in this drug_ for this drug to give you energy_ it is taking the energy from your reserves. When the stimulant receptors can no longer respond to the drug_ disease sets in and your body gives out.,F,51,25  years30 1X D,4/22/2016Email,Adderall 10

If I was closer to my ""normal"" weight_ the total weight loss would be on the order of 20-25 pounds_ and this weight loss occurred over the span of a year. Another ""side effect"" is that the drug has had a positive effect on my depression.

18, 1, ADD and mild depression,"This drug ruined my life. I don't know if it was only the adderall or toxicity coming from me combining it with Luvox and glutamic acid. Adderall has bene proven to be highly and permanently neurotoxic in both animals and humans at dosages similiar to those used ""medically"". It slowly sucks the personality and soul out of you and turns you into a horrible_ paranoid person. Adderall_ Vyvanse and Dexedrine are all just fancy names for Speed/Amphetamine. They are extremely similar to and equally potent to Methamphetamine. Please everyone get this in your head people. Meth differs from Adderall by one Methyl group. It has identical mechanism of action and side effects as Meth. You see all those faces of Meth warnings? Yeah....that can happen to you if you use too much Amphetamine (Adderall) too. I study Public Health and feel oblidged to inform people that Big Pharma is evil. They somehow manage to market neurotoxic street drugs and give them to millions of kids across the U.S. T",If you have ADHD I recommend you smoke Medical Cannabis. It has a positive effect on concentration for those with ADHD_ especially strains high in CBD and doesn't wreak havoc on your body/mind like this legal Speed does. It is not only neuroprotective (protects the brain)_ but it also has anti inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. If we never resorted to poisoning a majority of the population with toxic chemicals made by Pharma companies and the FDA actually did its job properly_ by outlawing all of the toxic chemicals_ 'medicines' and genetically modified foods that have been proven in both preclinical and human studies to cause harm_ then we would all be far more happy and healthy. By the way_ the U.S. is the only country that legitimately prescribes Amphetamine to its population. Amphetamine is outlawed in practically all countries due to the well known toxic effects the drug has on the brain and its ability to cause paranoid psychosis in previously healthy individuals.,M,21,2  months30 4X D,11/22/2015,Adderall 10
19, 1, ADD,This drug ruined my life. Apathy- I get no pleasure from anything anymore due to this drug frying the dopamine receptors in the brain. I have developed an anxiety disorder and paranoia directly because of this drug. In animals administering this drug only a few times permanently destroys 50-60% of your dopamine receptors. It also causes brain changes reminiscent of schizophrenia. Read the below articles if your interested. I can only recommend suing your doctor because Adderall is amphetamine/aka speed and should not be given to uninformed patients. http://www.jneurosci.org/content/19/21/9579.full.pdfhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142493 http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/315/1/91.fullhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486243Psychiatry and the government are evil.

22, 1, ADHD,This drug will make you feel great the first few days you take it. Then you start building a tolerance. What almost nobidy realizes is that this drug is highly neurotoxic to your brain_ with your dopamine neurons being destroyed the most rapidly. Most of the people reviewing this drug are too addicted to this poison to realize that it has permanently damaged their brains natural capacity to feel pleasure.,"I dare anyone who has used used this drug for more than a month to go off it and see if they can still feel the same amount of pleasure in life that they could before taking this neurotoxin. This is the primary substance used in animal models to create a permanent brain change reminiscent of paranoid schizophrenia. In monkeys given adderall for 3 weeks_ 40-60% of their dopamine nerons are destroyed and this damage has shown to be irreversible. Adderall creates a plain_ hollow shell of a human being who is productive yet lacks the other attributes of being human_ such as strong emotions_ empathy and creativity. Hence why its FDA approved for ADHD. I have a masters in Public Health so trust me when I tell you to keep away from adderall. Methylphenidate and Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) are far safer alternatives as they dont cause any lasting damage to your brain when used for  up to a year. If your interested in reading more then type in on Google: ""neurotoxicty of amphetamine ADHD"" or if you want to see human studies then ""amphetamine and parkinsons disease risk"" or ""Dopaminergic dysfunction in dextroamphetmine users"". The neurotoxicity caused by amphetamine containing drugs is the reason they aren't approved for use in Europe_ with Methylphenidate containing drugs being the only ones available.

I am now able to sit down and focus long enough to get things done (coursework_ the dreaded reconciling-of-the-checking-account_ bill-paying_ etc.).  I am less impulsive and less hyperkinetic.  I can easily make plans and execute them.  Returning to a task after an interruption takes much_ much less time.  These are huge_ huge things for me.There *are* side-effects: my appetite is definitely reduced.  I manage this by eating before_ between_ and after my doses. I feel quite fatigued by bedtime.  For me_ this is a plus -- I have had serious insomnia for my entire life; the fatigue allows me to sleep.  I had dry mouth and constipation for a few days_ but those resolved quickly.  If your doc prescribes Adderall_ don't let the bad reviews scare you off without a trial.  Remember that people are more likely to report bad experiences than good ones.  There are plenty of us out there for whom Adderall makes the difference between barely functioning (if that) and brilliantly succeeding.",M,27,21  days10mg 2X D,3/20/2015Email,Adderall 10

41, 1, Chronic Fatigue,Depression_ chronic fatigue_ teeth grinding_ crying spells_ loss of personality_ loss in interests_ weight gain when you stop taking it,I'm pretty sure this medication is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. NO ONE should take this stuff. It will make you nuts. Before I started taking Adderal 20mg 2x a day_ I was a vibrant_ happy go lucky chick. I started taking it because of chronic day sleepiness associated with a sleep disorder.  But honestly my life was much better before I ever took this stupid medicine.  Now mind you_ I've never taken more then prescribed... If anything_ I'd take less the prescribed because then I'd get my refills every other month instead of every month. Pretty much when one starts taking Adderall you feel great! Lots of energy_ lots of interest in doing every mundane thing you've never wanted to do... And you do it happily!  Great concentration and focus on everything you do. Plus_ you really start doing things to the BEST of your ability (cleaning_ organizing_ laundry_ cooking etc) so you feel like you've hit the jackpot.  Until you start getting depressed like I did.  I was taking adderal for 1 year when I noticed that I had to set my adderal right next to me on my nightstand so I could take it as soon as my alarm went off_ otherwise I would not be able to get myself out of bed.  Shortly after_ I found myself not being able to do anything if I had forgotten to take my medication or something. But t really hit me when I went on vacation and forgot my meds. It was one week of hell on earth. I wanted to do nothing but sleep day and night.  I had to lie to my friends and say th,F,32,6  years20mg,2/17/2015,Adderall 10

It was one of my favorite meds. I was in college and it gave me amazing focus and straight As. Unfortunately_ I have Glaucoma and this med worsens it due to raising pressure in the eyes. It can also cause other eye problems_ just an FYI. This med made me care about schoolwork_ I had extreme focus. I'm just at a point in life now where I don't want to rely on meds. I believe diet changes and exercise are the way to go.,F,24,2.5  years15 1X D,12/28/2014Email,Adderall 10
45, 1, focus_ weight loss,Shallow breathing (can't quite catch my breath_ which leads to yawning_ which -due to the anxiety_ I can't get the yawn all the way out! Makes me more and more anxious_ and my breathing more irregular!) Excessive swallowing (also feels like there's build up in my throat that is interfering with my breathing which ALSO causes anxiety) has anyone else heard of this?? Sometimes I have an overly outgoing personality (can't stop talking_ over-explaining_ dragging out my sentences. Just annoyingly talkative.)_ Either that_ or I have a flat personality_ irritability (from anxiety when ppl ask me too many questions_ or talk too much_ or won't let me focus on tasks_ interrupt_ etc.) productive even with things I hate to do (and would not do if it wasn't for the damn pill)_ OCD_ Lack of time management - which causes me to zone out on details_ wasting too much energy and time on something insignificant_ insomnia_ spacing out_ distant in social settings_ memory loss_ lack of enjoyment in things I used to do when I am not on it_ increased dosage due to easy & quick tolerance build up. Flu-like symptoms_ cold sweats (funny odor)_ FEVER!!!_ heart racing or skipping beats_ loss of appetite_ blurred vision_ increased bowel movements_ dry mouth_ lack of thirst. Overall_ it helped me focus the first couple of weeks_ & I DEFINITELY enjoyed my slimmer figure due to the loss of desire to eat anything_ however it QUICKLY backfired with dizziness_ headaches_ and weakness the second I crashed,"And ""Focus"" turned into OCD and anxiety. These are obviously easy to abuse and NOT worth. It's clearly unhealthy and hard on my body.

I have a very mentally challenging job_ with  many small details to manage over the course of a month. Been slowly letting projects uncompleted_ just too much to focus on. Getting this drug prescribed was a long time in the making. I had to go to three different psychiatrists for them to finally make the connection in my behaviour. I've been taking it about a week now_ haven't really noticed too much of a change with my ability to focus and stay on topic. I've had depression for about 3 years. Also take 400mg  Bupropion daily. I will try this for another 3 weeks_ and talk with the doc_ about maybe upping the daily dose. I'm hoping that this drug and its dependency will mellow out over time. About 4 hours after taking it_ I crash hard and feel somber_ and tired. It's not like a caffeine crash_ its different.,M,,7  days10mg 1X D,11/18/2014,Adderall 10
47, 5, ADHD,should only be taken in the morning or else you won't sleep. Become more social I feel the need to talk to everyone in the world. Dehydration is common so drink lots of water.

48, 3, ADHD inattentive,Blunted emotions when I take it (don't laugh as much)_ Hard to eat but remember to else you'll crash hard and doesn't work as much_ increases addictive behavior such as smoking and a bit OCD when I take it.,It's helps when you use it for studying_productivity_ etc. but it's easy to loose sight of what you started taking it for in the first place. In highschool I didn't use it as prescribed and grades actually went down. Helps to take it while your studying not before and if you have problems with self control let someone you trust hold it for you. There's gonna be a day where you WILL take 1 or 2 more than your supposed to think nothing of it_ eventually over time you'll find yourself running out of your prescription within a week and regretting it.,M,20,4  years30 1xday,11/3/2014,Adderall 10
49, 3, ADD,slight loss of appetite. Mild crash of energy after med wears off - but that does not bother me.,"I take 5 (five!) mg_ not 10. My doctor believes_ as do I_ that medications are NOT one size fits all_ and that it is always better to  take as little as you need.This drug was helpful for my organization_ productivity and calming my mind_ but I have not taken it long enough to know if I will stay with it or try something else.Some of the ""comments"" and misc. rambling about this drug are some of the most bizarre that I have seen on this site. Either Adderall truly has some potential to cause terrifying mental side effects_ or it just so happens that the people posting comments here have other very serious mental illnesses that they are not aware of? OR people are taking WAY too high of a dose. Or maybe all three.I was prescribed 5 mg_ and told to SPLIT THE TAB IN HALF AND TAKE 2.5 mg for a week and gradually increase. I would urge people to NOT take 10 mg at first_ but to work your way up_ and not to ever take doses as high as 30 or god forbid 60. DOSE MATTERS. Think about how you feel about half a beer or 10 beers.Too high a dose of anything can cause terrible side effects. A smaller dose could be the answer for some.",F,49,2  weeks 1X D,10/23/2014Email,Adderall 10

I hope that after reading this someone_  who might be in a similar situation_  will get a better understanding of how horrible and life destroying is this drug.My husband one day just decided to go to a doctor and ask for rx to treat ADD_ because he had problems concentrating on daily tasks or work. Let me mention_  that he did so without my knowledge. Only months later I found out that he got on some meds_ after his behavior became completely insane.  when I say insane_  here's what I mean :We have a house in the city_  on a very busy street_ next to a small unoccupied parking lot_ obviously a lot of cars pull in there just to turn around. One morning when he  was leaving for work_ a car slowly turned around there and left. When he came home_  he accused me of cheating_  saying that when he was leaving someone was waiting for me outside and when they saw him_ they got scared and drove away.  I couldn't believe this nonsense!!  I was trying to reason with him_ but the whole situation escalated to a scandal with him cursing me out and breaking furniture: he broke two dinning room chairs_ turned them into chips!! I didn't know what to do_  cause I couldn't understand then why is this happening. Next he developed a massive porn addiction; he got on adult friend finder_ Craigslist casual encounters and other garbage saying that I must be on those sites and he will find my profile.  When he'd think he ""found my profiles""",,M,39,3  years,9/4/2014Email,Adderall 10

I have serious heart problems_ social anxiety_ rice developed an eating disorder_ lost every friend I've ever had from isolating. I don't feel like a human being anymore_ nor do I remember how to live a normal life. I permanently feel bugs crawling on me and have destroyed my skin from the length if time on this drug. I am a pretty girl but adderall has ruined my appearance more then you can imagine.  It's great at first_ your on top of the world but it doesn't last and it is NOT worth what I've been though with health problems the past year linked directly to adderall. I use a breathing machine 4 times a day because I can hardly breathe. If you give this medicine to your child at a young age_ do your research. ADHD can be treated other ways. I wouldn't wish what I've been through on anyone. The last week on this medicine I didn't sleep for 5 days_ at work I started hallucinating and my face swelled up_ I couldn't move and it landed me in the hospital.
