0, 1, for a week long diarrheal illness,Taken only once_ I had severe cramping_ pain_ vomiting and bloating_ which necessitated a trip to the ER where they thought I had appendicitis. Only after a white count and xray revealed I had a colon full of gas_ did they cancel the surgery. Finally 6 hours after taking the Imodium AD the gas began to pass and relief came.,,M,17,1  times,5/19/2007,Imodium advanced
1, 5, IBS Triggered By Anxiety,Somewhat gassy_ but not very problematic. May try the anti-gas form of the drug.,Amazingly effective at controlling irritable bowel syndrome triggered by anxiety_ e.g. having to use the bathroom because of being in public. This drug works at controlling this terrible aspect of my anxiety/depression/OCD where Wellbutrin_ Zoloft_ Paxil_ Prozac_ Lexapro_ Lorazepam_ Xanax_ and Valium have failed! I cannot recommend it highly enough.,M,22,1  months,4/24/2007,Imodium advanced
