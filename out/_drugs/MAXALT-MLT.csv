0, 3, migraines,Initially very satisfied. Was an absolute god send to me. Nothing had ever made any impact in my migraines and then my doctor told me to try mazalt. Worked so well. With in half an hour to an hour the migraine and all its affects are completely gone. However i get migraines as regularly 2 times a week so my doctor started putting me on preventive meds. Sadomigrain then amitriptyline. Worst mistake ever. The amitriptyline with the maxalt produced some scary side affects. I had 2 episodes of SVT_ frequent PVC'S and was just generally feeling really unwell. I did not know what was happening. All the sudden i was sick all the time. My doctor checked for heart disease_ and they are now checking for nuralogical. I was scared it might of been cancer because my sister died of cancer. And then i noticed weird symptoms like my blood pressure went into stage 1 hypotension_ increased pvc's and i had muscle spasms in my leg after taking maxalt. So I looked up the side affects of maxalt and just so happened to read first where it said it is recommended that maxalt and amitriptyline are not given together as they increase the effects of one or both medications. So now i need to find out if the side effects at permanent_ and what i can do about them. The echo of my heart showed enlargement and stage 1 calcification of the aorta valve. So just be very careful what medications you are taking together even if your doctor prescribes tbem.,,F,31,3  years,2/25/2016Email,Maxalt-mlt

2, 5, Severe migraines,None,I use this as needed for migraines.  It is a lifesaver.  The sooner you take it_ the sooner your migraine will go away.  I feel groggy for a couple of days afterwards but not any worse than I wold have had I gone through the whole migraine experience.  This stuff is simply amazing.  I will say:  do NOT use it if it expires.  It really loses efficacy.  I found this out by accident.,F,42,1  days15 mg 1X D,10/19/2015,Maxalt-mlt
3, 4, Frequent severe migraines,Deel very heavy_ nauseous and tired - to the point where i feel nauseous just thinking about taking a pill. Very heavy head_ nasty feeling like brain is being pulled downwards. Tremor_ cant keep head upright_ urgent need to sleep (usually for a few hours and feeling of being over sedated_ sometimes making it difficult to sleep initially)_ slurred speach_ general effects of drowsiness.,I do get a very uncomfortable reaction from this medication_ which makes me reluctant to take this medication when i have a migraine. However_ it does work nearly every time i do take it so it is often worth the unpleasent sies effects and sleeping for a few hours and not taking on an empty stomach helps a little with these.,F,35,4  years10mg 1X D,10/13/2014,Maxalt-mlt

5, 5, migraine,I've taken maxalt for at least 5 years perhaps more. I like the melts much better than the pill since I also get nauseous.  The pill takes much longer to work for me. Usually it relieves my headache 100%. Sometimes it takes a couple hours.,,F,44,5  years10,5/4/2013,Maxalt-mlt

I have hyponeutremia (chronically low sodium) so have to eat lots of salt. When one vomits they get rid of mostly sodium so I had to stop imitrex. Maxalt is the greatest if for some reason didn't work have to take vicodin.

12, 5, Migraines,Occasional tiredness but goes away after a short period of time.  Allows me to take it whenever I need it because of so few_ if any_ side effects.,This drug saved my life...or should I say gave me a life back.  My insurance doesn't cover it...but it's so important to me that I've found ways to pay for it.  It's THAT important. I tried other things that only made me sick.  Only drawback..doesn't work if I take it before I go to sleep_ for some reason. .,F,60,11  years10 1X AN,9/27/2012,Maxalt-mlt

14, 5, Migraine,Slight drowsiness,I have had migraines for years and was always afraid to take medications for them.  I finally started Maxalt on the advice of my doctor and I am so glad that I got over the fear.  I used to spend hours in bed suffering with extreme headache pain_ nausea_ light/sound/smell sensitivity and vomiting.  Now_ if I catch it in time_ it will get better usually within an hour.  I even feel comfortable taking it at work.  If I wake up with a migraine that is well underway_ I will take Maxalt and lay down for a few hours.  It definitely helps me control my migraine and gives me back the precious time that I used to lose having to sleep one off!  It has been a life changer for me and I always have them with me!,F,54,1  years10 mg 1X AN,2/24/2012Email,Maxalt-mlt

I layed down and I could barely breathe. I seriously thought that I was going to die that night laying in my bed_ probably should have went to the ER. NEVER TAKING THIS MEDICINE EVER AGAIN. And the best part was I still had my migraine the whole time this was  happening_ didnt even make it any better. Wish I would have read the side affects and reviews before I had taken this drug.

18, 1, Migraines,Dry Mouth,This drug has not worked for me at all.  I have tried over a week for my cluster migraines and have had little or no relief whatsoever.  I was originally using Imigran (Sumatriptan) which was quite effective_ however took up to an hour to work.  The doctor recommended Maxalt to me and I have been miserable ever since.  I have just taken another Maxalt which has done nothing at all.  I am going to get some more Imigran today as this is the only thing that works.  Unfortunately I now have to wait 24hrs until I can take them.  This is torture when you are expected to function at work and look after children at home.  I am so glad that Maxalt has worked for many of you.  In my case it is Imigran that works well for me so I am still unsure why the doctor prescribed Maxalt.  If you find a good thing_ stick to it!  Good luck everyone.,F,41,7  days10mg 1X D,2/12/2012Email,Maxalt-mlt
19, 5, migraines,Very few--mainly more fatigue.,Maxalt MLT is the only drug that works on my migraines. Imitrex_ Relpax_ etc. just don't work.  I love the MLT as I typically throw up if I don't catch the migraine soon enough.  This drug works within 30 minutes of taking it and as long as I've taken it early enough_ always works. I use the 5mg_ as the 10mg makes my chest feel tight (kinda freaky).  For a migraine sufferer_ this is a wonderful drug.,F,43,5  years5 1X AN,1/20/2012,Maxalt-mlt
20, 4, very sick headaches,None that i can remember,it helps more often than not_ as long as it is the melt and not the pill because I am so nauseated from the headache I can't keep anything down. I have also tried Sumavel needlefree injection (sumatriptan) and I do have a prescription for Zomig 2.5mg that sometimes works if I can catch it in time before the nausea sets in. The Maxalt is a lifesaver when it works it's a true miracle and that is exactly what I need when I'm sick like that because I can't even get out of bed. On the rare occasions I have made it to the doctor or ER I have gotten injections of Toradol which work like a charm as well as injections for the nausea. But like others have said here it is extremely expensive_ I am on Medicaid and I can only get two doses at a time. My neurologist has prescribed Zomig nasal spray which comes 12 individual doses to a box and two boxes costs over $500.00....I know ridiculous_ huh? But it does work although I need to keep from swallowing too much of the spray since it may make me sick if I swallow it_ but it works. The injections were too difficult for me to use as I'm often too weak to do it correctly. So I can only hope somehow the drugs will come down in price because I'd be in trouble if I lost my insurance or they wouldn't pay for it.,F,53,1  years5mg 1X D,1/16/2012Email,Maxalt-mlt

23, 1, Migraine,pretty much all of them but very mild and brief.  Seemed to be the same side effects as Imitrex. Hot flashes_ slight nausea_ kind of a wind burn feeling on the surface of the skin. All very mild though,I tried Maxalt as a sample from my doc_ i have been taking Sumatriptan for about five years now and asked for some alternatives when i started having trouble with my regular script not working as well as it had in the past. He gave me two of the 10mg melts and i tried them the next time i felt a migraine coming on. They did absolutely nothing for me except give me some of the side effects. There was not even the slightest relief from the headache so i took the second at about three hours after the first and still nothing. The worst part was now i could not take anything else for 24 hours and it was miserable. I have not had to deal with a full on migraine in years having been able to knock them out with my regular script. Incidentally i think the issue with my current script stems from when my pharmacy switched from Dr Reddys to Sun Pharma_ i have discussed with my doc and will try going back to Dr Reddys or switch to Treximet. I have read here that Maxalt has worked well but for some reason it had no effect at all for me. Good luck out there people_ hope everyone finds their relief.,M,45,1  days10mg 1X D,11/14/2011Email,Maxalt-mlt

25, 5, Severe Migraine Headaches,I'm very tired and cry for a few hours afterwards.,I have been suffering for about a year and a half and refused to take the Imitrex.  I had no choice but to break down and take the Maxalt for the first time on Sunday.  My headache got worse and then immediately better in 20 minutes.  It's a miracle drug.

26, 5, migraine,None!,This med works awesome for me!  I put the tab under my tongue and my migraine is completely gone in 5 minutes.  I had previously tried Imitrex_ Amerge_ and Midrin with no success.  I have no side effects with Maxalt_ and my whole body feels relaxed after taking it.  I did notice that the regular Maxalt (the tab you swallow) didn't work as well for me as the tab you put under your tongue that melts.  I do wish this drug had a generic though because it is very expensive and my new insurance is giving me a hard time with prior authorizations trying to get it:(,F,28,2  years10 1X AN,9/22/2011,Maxalt-mlt
27, 5, Chronic migraines,None!,I've suffered migraines for 15 years (since I was 5) and I've never experienced anything like this medicine! For me it takes about an hour to work_ so I have to take it as soon as I start noticing visual disturbances_ but I can actually feel it kicking in and making the headache go away.

29, 5, Severe chronic migraine,Drowsiness_ drugged/dopey feeling.  Worse by far is the awful_ awful full-body aches from Maxalt_ from top of head to soles of feet (this side effect has gotten worse over the years).  Even my eyelids and the palms of my hands hurt.  Eating (once migraine nausea subsides) helps relieve the body aches.,Imitrex nasal spray worked for me for years until one day it didn't (and never did again).  Tried other triptans but Maxalt is my go-to. Gives fast_ long-lasting relief_ drowsiness is not so bad as to be debilitating.  But the body aches are awful_ and have gotten worse over the years.  Feel like I've been beaten_ lasts about 8 hours.  But still better than suffering out a migraine.  A good preventive routine (mine is bystolic_ a beta blocker) and a rescue prescription (mine is toradol injections) help too.

31, 5," To ""break"" a migraine headache.",No side effects whatsoever.,"I suffered from migraine headaches (""grade 3"" level--the worst ones) my entire life. Although I never took any time off while at school_ and later work_ it was very difficult to deal with even the simplist of daily tasks. Advil worked some of the time. After one very bad stretch of migraines (6 month period_ shortest time between migraines was one hour_ longest migraine was 10 days in length.)_ I had enough. I spoke to my doctor. I was put on Amitriptyline to help control the migraine cycle_ and Maxalt Rapid Tabs to ""break"" the migraines. Maxalt will not work if the headache is not a migraine. If it is one_ Maxalt usually works inside of 10 minutes for me. If the migraine fades back but remains_ Advil usually ""breaks"" the remainder. I do feel drowsy after a migraine ""breaks"" but this is a normal reaction for me and is an after-effect of the migraine itself_ not the medication I have taken. (There were many times I had not taken anything at all for a migraine_ and when it finally ""broke""_ I would feel drowsy until the next day.).  Although it may not have the same successful result for everyone_ I would recommend a migraine sufferer to give it a try.",F,47,5  years10 mg 1X AN,2/12/2011,Maxalt-mlt
32, 2, Migraines,I did not experience any side effects.,This started out as a wonder drug for me. However_ as time wore on_ it seemed that the Maxalt was only postponing the migraine. It would start on the left side of my face. I'd take the pill and in half an hour it was gone. The next day it would be on the right. I'd take another and it would go. The next day_ it would be on the left again. This last time_ I just called in sick and toughed it out with Gravol like I used to_ and it has definitely gone. Other times I would need two pills to get rid of the migraine. Then it would recur_ as usual_ a few days later. Even my doctor_ who uses Maxalt_ agrees that there's some kind of rebound effect_ that the body almost requires the migraine to do whatever it's supposed to do!,F,51,1  years10 mg 2X D,2/2/2011,Maxalt-mlt

I was worried about side effects_ but they were not a big issue -  a migraine will put me too bed with either way. My head still feels calm and clear a day later. I think it really broke the cycle! I haven't been this pain free in weeks. I guess sometimes you don't realize what you put up with on a regular basis until it is gone. It also has wiped out a lot of muscle tension throughout my body- I can see how this could be a bit much for some_ but for me it's a good thing.,F,40,1  days10 MG 1X D,1/5/2011,Maxalt-mlt

I was absolutely amazed with the results the second time I took it... I could still function_ instead of the headache hitting 10 on the richter scale it was more a 3-4 and everytime I take it the headache is less and less. I don't vomit_ which I nearly always did before. To me this drug is a miracle_ I don't get migraines that often but when I did they would take a whole day from me...

I've had migraines since I was a child_ getting worse over the years_ with and without aura. I get 15+ a month. Ugh. I've been on tons of drugs to prevent (haven't found one that works yet) and to abort. I was prescribed Maxalt about 8 years ago after trying all the narcotics_ Imitrex etc. It was a life saver. It has ""weakened"" a bit in efficacy over the years_ sometimes I may need to take it with three advil or take two in order for it to kick a headache in the butt_ but it still does it's job wonderfully. I honestly don't know how I survived without it. I also get rebound migraines after taking a triptan and Maxalt has the least frequency of this happening. Doctors keep trying to get me to switch to other triptans_ not sure why but Maxalt seems like one of their least favs of the triptans_ and I keep coming back to it.

My doctor prescribed it to take as needed with advil to take care of my migraines. Worked well except for the slightly tilted vision and severe itching of the face. I don't know if those side effects are typical though. All in all I'd say I was very satisfied with this medicine. It's been the most effective one yet for me.,F,15, 10 MG 1X AN,9/20/2010,Maxalt-mlt

The headache did kick in but it was nothing compared to the usual pain I experience. I also took 3 Advil and was able to function for the rest of the day which I have never been able to do in the 17 years I've been a migraine sufferer.

When ever I take a Maxalt my pain in shoulder area and upper back is better for at lest 24 hours.,F,52, 10 mg 1X D,6/1/2010Email,Maxalt-mlt
52, 5, Migraine.,None_ save perhaps for slight drowsyness but I always need to sleep after recovery usually.,A lifesaver for me. Suffered with terrible migraines for 40 years. I had suffered with them since my teens and got used to them getting them once a month or every week in later life. I thought it was natural to get one having them for so long.- over 40 years!Finally went to doctors (yes after all that time!) as it was getting too much for me getting older. Doc prescribed Maxalt and next time a migraine started I took half a pill and lay down. half hour later it has stopped were before I would have been looking at 12 hours minimum of throwing up and head torture.Then 24 hours to recover. Now 9 times out of 10 this wonder pill stops a migraine in its tracks. I usually only have to take half pill too. Bliss. I thought migraines were a way of life I had got so used to them over the years. Funny thing was after 40 years I cut out sugar after hearing Jack l'Laine (spelling?)fitness guru_ on the radio in 2005 saying he used to have headaches and cut sugar out of his diet and never got one again. I tried that (stopped  sugar as much asI could)and found that YES_ Sugar sets mine off! So I cut sugar out and I rarely get a Migraine now unless I eat sugary things (and No I am not diabetic) but if I do these pills save me.Thankyou.,M,56, 5 - 10 mg 1X AN,5/21/2010Email,Maxalt-mlt
53, 5, Severe Migraines,None,This drug has been a miracle! Nothing else has ever helped me! I have tried EVERYTHING! It is expensive though. With my insurance I still have a copay of $50 for a max of 12 pills a month. Im a college student_ so thats a lot fo money for me! There isnt a generic available in the US yet =/,F,21,3  months10mg 1X AN,5/11/2010,Maxalt-mlt
54, 5, severe migraines,Dry mouth. Felt some tingling in the hands.,Great medication.  It has been God-sent. I have tried sooo many others to no avail.  If taken right away on the onset of the migraine_ it will work right away.  Not everyone is the same so it works differently for everyone.  Sometimes I have to take 2 within 24 hours because it will go away but after 10 hours the pain comes back.,F,45,8  months10 mg 2X D,4/2/2010,Maxalt-mlt
55, 5, Migraines,Cotton mouth...no biggie.,"The BEST migraine medication out there. First I was on Topamax....felt like a ""mentally challenged zombie"" with numb hands. Then I was on Axert_ that worked really well to_ but it was VERY expensive. Maxalt-MLT is a miracle drug_ works VERY fast (30-60 minutes). I totally recommend this to anyone who suffers with migraines.",F,31,6  months10 3X M,3/14/2010,Maxalt-mlt

57, 1, Migrain,Doctors recommendation was taking it when the migraine starts: 15 Min. after taken the pill my light migraine(level 2 pain) was a full blown migraine(level 10+).As recommended by the doctor_ I took the second dose after 3 hours_ after 1/2 an hour my head felt as if it was in a vise and my skull was to small for my brain. 12 hours after taken the medicine the dressiness started_ that lasted the whole next day.,I have food allergy migraines 2+ times a month_ which last 2-6 hours. When I catch the migraine early 2 EXCEDRIN Migraine pills getting rid of the pain.With MAXALT-MLT I was 2 days in pain: never again.,F,55,1  days10mg 2X AN,2/27/2010,Maxalt-mlt
58, 4, Migraines,I usually experience 1-2 migraines a month_ mostly due to hormonal issues. My migraines will last for a period of 36-48 hours. I've lived with migraines for 35+ years.,I switched to Maxalt-MLT and really like the quick dissolving tablet_ however_ my migraine usually comes back about 8 hours later and then I retake another tablet. I just wish the medication would last at least 12 hours!,F,49,3  months,12/10/2009,Maxalt-mlt
59, 3, Migraines,Slight drowsiness-not sure if it's from the meds or the headache_ sudden need to urinate (usually when the meds start working)_ cotton mouth_ rebound headaches,"This was a miracle drug in the beginning-I get around 2 migraines a month-sometimes hormonal_ sometimes food allergies_ sometimes I have no idea why....through the years I've had to take more as I get more rebound headaches-it usually ""wears off"" after about 9 hours and I usually need about 4-5 doses to knock it out-seems like I'd have the migraine for about 48 hours whether I took meds or not.",F,42,7  years,11/16/2009Email,Maxalt-mlt
