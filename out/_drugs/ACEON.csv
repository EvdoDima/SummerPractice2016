0, 4, hypertension,Initially experienced a metalic taste in the mouth. This did not effect the taste of food_ and appetite was not negatively effected. Metalic taste has now disappeared.,Perindopril Erbumine 4mg in combination with exercise and intelligent diet has effectively lowered my blood pressure from 160/105 (the highest reading prior) to consistently below 135/82 as the highest reading since this medication was introduced. This is the first time trying a pharmaceutical approach for hypertension. I will note that I experienced unpleasent side effects from several herbal remedies. Believe me_ I would not be taking a pharmaceutical if I did not need to_ and this drug has been helpful even at the low dose.,M,53,2  months,7/8/2009,Aceon
1, 3, blood pressure,,,,, ,12/15/2008,Aceon
2, 1, High Blood Pressure,Palpitations_ no blood pressure lowering (bp increased while taking it)_ bloated face (only realised when started looking at photos of myself)_ vision problems_ insomnia_ depression_ sweating_ weight gain_ constant low-grade allergic reaction.,I thought this drug was ok when I started taking it - I read the packet insert and thought it would help to lower my blood pressure and reduce the risk of strokes.  When I started taking it I was pretty stressed out so probably didn't notice all of the side effects - it's only since I stopped taking it that I realised how awful it was.  I lost interest in life while I was taking Perindopril and became very depressed.  This med caused me lots of other symptoms including joint pain and a really bad rash if I went out in the sun.  My view is that this is definately one to avoid unless you are really desparate.  And when it's combined with a diuretic it's pure hell!,M,30,3  years,8/9/2008,Aceon
3, 1, High blood pressure,Persistent and choking dry cough. Keeps me awake at night and affects me at work. There is nothing worse than talking on the phone and having a choking_ spluttering coughing fit.,I have stopped taking the medication because the coughing drove me crazy. I'm going to try to cope with high blood pressure in some other way.,F,50,45  days,10/20/2007,Aceon
4, 4, Hypertension,Mild. Every few hours_ a dry cough lasting a minute or less. It also gave me tinnitus (ringing in the ears) but not badly.Occasion discomfort in my lower gut_ taking with a full glass of water avoids this.,Overall_ this medication helped and didn't make me sleepy_ in fact I think it increased my alertness. I have tried other meds which I couldn't tolerate. I was taking 4mg of aceon daily. My BP dropped about 10-15mmHg to 125/85 or so. My doctor wants it lower and asked me to try a combination. He is putting me on lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5. I'm apprehensive. I like Aceon. I also have a friend who takes it and she says she feels great.,M,55,6  weeks,3/15/2007,Aceon
5, 2, high bp,brutal dry cough that kept me up 2-3 amd every morning till I fell asleep....I rather have the BP than having to be a miserable SOB and wiped out due sleep deprivation...called Dr and switched meds,,M,47,1  months,1/25/2007,Aceon
6, 4, To treat high blood pressure,After the first hour there was some dizziness or lightheadedness when standing too quickly.  Just take care when changing positions.  For the first week I had a slight headache and some mild nausea but neither was so troublesome I stopped taking meds.  The pain wasn't even worthy of taking any other medicine.,(Since first being diagnosed at age 17 with high BP)I have been on 23 different types of BP medicines  trying to control my BP which flucuates from EXTREMELY high to extremely low. I am extremely sensitive to medicine and react very quickly.  This was the first medicine that has controlled my BP keeping it almost in a normal range.   Women- be cautious not to become pregnant_ very harmful to fetus.,F,29,7  months,1/24/2006,Aceon
