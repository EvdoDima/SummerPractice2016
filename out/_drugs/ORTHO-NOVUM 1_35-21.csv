2, 5, Pregnancy prevention_ regulation,None,I have been taking Necon (the generic version of Ortho-Novum) for a little over a year now_ and I can honestly say that I have had no problems with it_ whatsoever. In 5 years_ I've been on 4 different types of BC pills_ and this is the ONLY ONE that has not given me any of the usual side effects. I have not gained an ounce_ nor is my skin breaking out (two things that happened with other pills I've taken in the past). The best thing is that I NEVER notice any spotting while taking this pill continuously (instead of taking the placebo pills_ I go right on into a new pack_ thus skipping my period altogether). I feel as though I've finally found the pill that works for me!,F,23,1  years,11/13/2008,Ortho-novum 1/35-21
