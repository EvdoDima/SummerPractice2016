2, 1, Migraine,Treated at hospital for migraine.  The cocktail of drugs included reglan and caused anxiousness to point I had to walk around in hospital room.  This just compounded the migraine since I was unable to relax.  This is the second time it's happened to me.  I have had multiple treatments for migraines to include reglan but seems I'm now developing a reaction to the drug.  I will not be taking it anymore.,,F,45,1  days 1X D,7/23/2016,Reglan

5, 1, C-Diff,It has been decades since I was placed on Reglan.  I started having involuntary jerking of my hands and jaw movements.  I had suffered depression before but never like this depression.  My pulmonary doctor told me reglan could cause the jerking and after I stopped it_ it did cease.  The depression however held on for over three months.  I hope those who are experiencing this depression will take hope that it will not last forever and if they can endure it without other psychotic medications to hang in there.  I found benadryl at night helped.  One day I woke up and I was ME again.  However_ years later I will have short episodes of depression hit.  I have learned to recognize it and just breath and wait for it to pass.  In times of stress_ my jerks come back_ too. If you are depressed from this talk to those around you to make certain you don't harm yourself.  Knowing what I know today_ I would have tried using L-Tyrosine.,I would urge those who have negative effects report it.,F,67,2  months20mg,6/13/2016Email,Reglan
6, 1, Nausea in hospital,Severe anxiety/panic/terror_ severe depression_ delirium_ muscle spasms_ twitching muscles_ sore arms/legs/!back and shoulders_ weakness_ jaw clenching_ toes twitching_ hysterical crying_ inability to concentrate_ fear_ inability of being alone_ disassociation from my child_ insomnia and inability to stay asleep etc,Do not take this medication. I went to the ER for nausea and the dr gave me this via IV. I reacted to the first dose and they ignored me and gave me 2 more- too close together and I went into a delirium. Following that was severe gut wrenching depression and anxiety- both of which I never had before! That was 2 months ago and I have been suffering ever since. I have symptoms going on. I'm unsure of how long this is going to take but I am trying to fight for my life- as crazy as that sounds- this drug will destroy a perfectly normal life and person. I have never had mental issues before and I have had to see a psych. They prescribe meds but I won't take any. I am trying to heal on my own. However the physical stuff scares me- I am praying to God my exposure does not cause Tardive Dyskenisia. I notice I clench my jaw a lot and my neck/mouth hurts. I feel like Im holding my tongue weird and it's freaking me out. I'm seeing a neurologist soon to try and find answers. This has been a complete nightmare and I can't believe I've gone through this from a medication. I wouldn't believe it was true if it didn't happen to me- a perfectly normal functioning person turned into a basket case. This drug will put you through immense torture both mentally and physically. Please do your research and do not take this medication. I regret that day more than anything!!!!!,F,32,1  days30 mg,6/8/2016Email,Reglan

23, 1, Gastroparesis,Severe depression and and anxiety leading to mental breakdown,"My mother was prescribed this medication and soon after discontinuing med she started with depression_ anxiety_ nervousness_ insomnia_ anorexia_ and confusion. This medication took an active senior citizen who traveled_ had a circle of friends to socialize with_ maintained her single home on her own_ drove her own car and appeared 10 years younger than her age to a depressed_ suicidal_ crazy women. Weeks after stopping the medication along with the side effects she appeared to have aged 10 years older then what she was. Since she always looked 10 years younger_ this was such a significant change. She had to move in with family_ give up her house_ could not drive anymore_ refused to even talk with famy or friends on the phone_ constantly worried_ complained she felt as though she were ""jumping out of her skin""_ could not eat_ and had suicidal ideations. Despite therapist_ doctors_ antidepressants and anti anxiety meds_ my mother gave up her battle and refused water and food and a living will stated she desired no hydration_ medical intervention_ or tube feedings. She was lucid enough to re enforce her wishes. I believe this medication led to a complete mental breakdown as to which she was not returning from.

56, 1, morning sickness/nausea,Panic_ Irrational Fear_ extreme anxiety_ depression_ fatigue_ tremors,A min or so after the drug was inserted into my IV at the ER I panicked and started feeling trapped and very fearful. I started yelling for a nurse_ I didn't want to be alone_ I didn't want to be anywhere. It was only that day and almost a month later I feel anxiety that can only be described as the feeling I had that terrible day. I am now 16 weeks pregnant and I fear it may have had an effect on my baby. Do not take this if pregnant... Dumb doctors don't know what they prescribe. I mean really..what is this stuff!?,F,24,1  daysunknown,1/11/2015,Reglan

59, 1, Migraine,Agitation_ dread_ fear_ horrible panic ... I wanted to rip out IV and leave urgent care right away.  I didn't even care if my headache wasn't gone.  I was given benadryl which immediately took the edge off but I felt uncomfortable and anxious for the next 24 hours.  I never want to feel like that again.  It was horrible!.  I will definitely add it to my list of drug allergies.,,F,40,1  daysIV 1X D,10/22/2014,Reglan
