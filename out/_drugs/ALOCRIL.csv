0, 2, allergies,in the begining I had no side effects.  But then after a while I had the weirdest allergy.  When I took the drops i would feel burning but in the vaginal area.  It was like the burning went through my eyes and through my body.  It could have been a reaction.  Everytime I tried it again_ I would have the same reaction.  So that was the end of that medication.,But I did have great results for the first year.  It might work better with others.  I would give it a try.,F,29,1  years,6/17/2009,Alocril
