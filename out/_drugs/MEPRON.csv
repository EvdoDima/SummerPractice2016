0, 5, Advanced HIV Disease,Yellowish stools_ slight indigestion. Don't get it on your clothes_ the stains do not come out.,Hideous yellow color and awful taste_ but it definitely kept me out of the cemetary until my CD4 count went above 200.,M,38,3  months,5/18/2007,Mepron
1, 4, Bone Marrow Transplant,As stated below a horrible finger paint yellow color with a slight Maloxx-like citric taste and consistency. Causes me to have sudden_ unannounced_ and extremely soft stools of a yellow color. Basically ruins my morning exercise period. 10ml per day,This medicine kills protozoa and is used as a prophylactic during my weakened immune system period. Guards against malaria_ encephalytus_ etc_ etc. Taste not bad at first_ but now is difficult to stomach. Stains badly. Extremely expensive and amount is regulated per month by insurance carrier. However_ it gradually thickens_ sticking to the bottle interior_ and I always run out five to six days before I can purchase another.,M,61,6  months,5/18/2007,Mepron
2, 5, Ocular toxoplasmosis,While I was taking Mepron_ I was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia.  Don't know if the Mepron or the toxoplasmosis caused it_ or not.  Sometimes I got an anxious_ brain-fog_ through-my-whole-body unexplainable feeling that made me uncomfortable.  Every time it happened_ it went away by itself after a short time. It didn't happen at first_ but happened more often the longer I took it.,I didn't like having to time my meals to coincide with my 4x per day prescription_ especially I didn't like having to eat something right before I went to bed_ to get in that 4th dose.  I also didn't like having to eat fat with every Mepron dose.  If I didn't have health insurance_ the price would've killed me - $743.43 per bottle (a 14-day supply)!!  All in all_ a small inconvenience for saving my eyesight.,F,53,6  months,8/30/2006Email,Mepron
3, 4, Babesia (Lyme Co-infection),No side effects besides some slight fatigue and somewhat bad taste in mouth.,This medicine has a very striking color. It looks sort of like a bottle of finger paint. The taste is bearable and does not bother me. Not sure if it is doing anything to treat my infection but only time will tell. I rated it high because while it may not be helping me_ it is not hurting me either.,M,23,2  months,2/16/2006,Mepron
4, 3, Possible lyme,I was on zithromax_ plaquenil_ probenecid and omnicef when I added Mepron 2x a day.  I didn't have any side effects until I started Mepron such as extreme_ severe weakness_ felt anxious and overall weird feeling that eventually subsides. Then I had a couple of seizure-like episodes that lasted approx. 3 seconds.  Mini-blackouts.,Neon orange liquid.  Stains lips.  Tastes unpleasant.  Also took with other antibiotics and occasionally a miniscule amount of Vicodin and Ibuprofen for pain.  Had to stop the painkillers because it seemed to enhance the weakness caused by the Mepron.  Side effects aren't totally unbearable_ just uncomfortable.  But had to stop Mepron because of the seizures. To be fair_ not completely sure if Mepron caused it or the other meds.,F,44,40  days,8/30/2005,Mepron
