0, 5, Panic Attacks and Insomnia,Drowsiness,I have suffered from GAD and panic disorder since my teens. I have never abused my Xanax and have remained on a low dose for the last 10 years. My anxiety and panic attacks are due to a chemical imbalance and without my antidepressants and Xanax I can't function in life. I got to the point where I couldn't sleep_ eat or work because my panic attacks were so bad. Having a great psychiatrist_ therapist and the right medication helped me get my life back.,F,29,10  years.75mg,8/14/2016,Xanax

3, 5, Severe anxiety. PTSD,No side effects,This med has saved my life. I only use 1/2 the dose I'm suppose to take daily and only when I need it. It helps me fast and has given me my life back slowly. I think it's a great med. Being a (medically retired RN-OIF OEF )  RN I know that you must be responsible with this medication.

It's saving my life from so much I'm going through and giving me the ability to go out again and not stay locked up in the house,I'm VERY careful with this med. I'm careful with all meds including my pain med which is why I'm trusted by doctors to have whatever I need.  Be safe with it and it will help.

6, 5, GAD_ Panic,Slight drowsiness if already fatigued.,"Changed the direction of my life. At what point would an addiction (physiological_ psychological - or both) be preferable to some other condition? I would say when the quality of life with an addiction is infinitely improved when compared to a life without an addiction. One definition of the word ""addiction"" is: ""dependence on or commitment to a habit_ practice_ or habit-forming substance to the extent that its cessation causes trauma"". For me_ anxiety and panic were utterly unbearable. Agoraphobia was creeping in_ and even then staying home offered little more consolation. Traumatic. If I were to stop taking alprazolam_ per the definition of the word ""addiction""_ it would be traumatic. Indeed it would. When a medication's dose isn't increased in years_ is effective at treating the symptoms with very little side effects_ available as a generic_ why cease with the medication? I'm not sure anyone knows if anxiety and panic can be cured_ and I would rather have a mild addiction than live the bleak life I once did.",M,39,8  years.25 mg 2X D,3/15/2016,Xanax
7, 5, Severe Anxiety,None,Xanax is a lifesaver for me. I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks and this medication works immediately and effectively. Makes life tolerable. I love it. I've also tried other benzos_ (klonopin_ valium_ Ativan_ tenazapam) to no avail.,F,39,5  years1mg,3/8/2016Email,Xanax
8, 1, anxiety,terrible fatigue and it will immediately become addicted and constantly having to up your dose. can make you very cloudy and out of focus. after getting to 6mg I couldn't handle it anymore and was put on klonopin with excellent results.,I hate Xanax. my tolerance to it was awful and the dose kept going up and finally I couldn't handle the fatigue. like most benzos its highly addictive and very hard to come off. if you miss a single dose you are in big trouble.,M,43,3  years6mg 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Xanax
9, 1, Anxiety_PTSD_Social Anxiety_ etc.,This drug works fabulously when you first start to take it. That quickly wears off and you need more and more to control your anxiety. It causes fatigue_ mental fogginess_ and short term memory loss for me,I am now a slave to this drug. When I first started taking it I had no idea that it was harder to come off of than heroin. I would never take any drugs of it's class knowing what I know now. I ran out early one time. I had to wait 7 days before I could have it refilled. My withdrawal experience can only be described as hellish.The worst anxiety I have ever had_ panic attacks_ visual and auditory hallucinations_ my body jerking all the time_ seizures_ sweating_ not being able to walk_ tinnitus_ (I hear that all the time now). I could not leave my house_ drive a car_ my husband had to help me get dressed. The only way to get off it is very slowly and most Doctors don't want to deal with that. They try to cut you off a milligram every 2 weeks or something. That just leads to more anxiety. I now obsess about running out of it. I count the pills in the bottle.  When it starts to get low I start to panic. I feel like a junkie but this drug comes from a Doctor and a Pharmacy. If you take this drug please only take a low amount for a few weeks. Don't be in hell like I am!,F,54,10  years10mg 4X D,2/18/2016,Xanax

11, 5, GAD_ Panic Attacks_ OCD,Tiredness_ hunger_ dry mouth,Xanax has been a godsend for me. I have been suffering from severe anxiety to the point where I wouldn't leave the house unless I was going to the ER_ where I was visiting on a weekly basis thinking I was having a heart attack or stroke. I was finally referred to a psychiatrist who prescribed me Xanax and Lexapro. I did ok on this for awhile until the Lexapro made me gain 40lbs and I then I became majorly depressed. I have been on a few others...Klonopin_ Buspar_ and Effexor. All made matters worse. Xanax makes me feel like a normal person again. I can leave the house_ I haven't been to the ER in a long time although I'm still a bit of a hypochondriac. I also find that the Xanax calms my OCD tendencies_ which are excessive cleaning and disinfecting my house. My racing thoughts are calmed and I've lost 30 of that 40lbs. Personally_ Xanax doesn't cause weight for me. It does make me hungry but if I eat something healthy and exercise regularly_ this is not a problem. On Lexapro_ I was working out and eating healthy with no weight loss_ just gain. I looked puffy; not the same type of weight gain as normal. My doctor seems to have no issue with this medication. He's aware that I take it as needed for anxiety and to stop the racing thoughts at night before bed. I would not get on airplanes before this. I now can travel and it's nice to actually get a good nights sleep. I don't need it constantly so if I have to come off of it eventually_ I hope it's not an issue but I do other thin,F,34,5  years1,2/1/2016Email,Xanax

13, 1, Anxiety,Interdose Withdrawls,This stuff is a nightmare.  The rebound anxiety from interdose withdrawals tricks you into thinking your anxiety is getting worse.  Finally during withdrawals- Heard voices_ 24/7 panic attacks_ muscle zaps_ spasms.  Couldn't bathe myself or walk for several days.  Watch out- if your muscles are sore the day after_ you're psychically addicted.,F,30,2  years.5,1/2/2016,Xanax
14, 5, Panic attacks,Dry mouth_ loss of coordination_ trouble focusing_ slurred speech,This drug is the best thing ever. I take a very small dose about .25 MG if I know I'm starting to panic or a whole .5 MG pill if I'm having a panic attack. This is the only thing that completely stops my panic attack. It has kept me from being hospitalized several times. I've taken it for about a month straight before and didn't have a hard time coming off it. I know that it can be addictive and has the risk of being abused but if used correctly for someone with panic attacks it is a life saver.,F,20,8  years.25 MG 1X AN,12/22/2015,Xanax

18, 5, Anxiety_ Panic Disorder_ nausea,Increased appetite_ mild sleepiness_ relaxation_ sometimes lowering of inhibition_ sometimes more emotional. I don't find any of these detrimental_ though.,I have suffered anxiety all my life. When I was younger I suffered extreme emetophobia which led me to always get nauseated during panic attacks. They were a nightmare. I was finally prescribed them around age 17. The first time I ever took them_ 1mg immediately wiped out my anxiety. I've been taking them regularly for four years. I was put on an ssri before regularly taking xanax_ and the ssri (Zoloft) actually made my nausea worse. I have taken other benzodiazepines (klonopin_ valium_ ativan)_ and found xanax to be the most helpful. It is fast acting (I place it under my tongue to dissolve) and immediately cures my anxiety/nausea and enables me to have a healthy appetite. I've had anxiety episodes last for weeks where I could eat nothing and I'd lose weight_ which is bad because I'm already small framed. Managing my anxiety with xanax has given me a healthy weight again_ has helped me do presentations_ get through school and work. It is a miracle drug. I'm currently taking about 1.5 to 2mg a day but will not exceed that as this can be very addictive and has worse withdrawals than most other drugs. For what it's worth_ I can stop taking it for days and have experienced no withdrawals. But I do usually take it daily now. I would recommend it to sufferers of severe anxiety of any kind.,F,24,4  years1mg,11/15/2015,Xanax
19, 5, suffered to 79lbs in mid 90's,I experienced relief_ yet scrutinized. To keep an open man I did try valium however it was too strong_ klonopin didn't agree with my chemistry and broke me out like a teenager and I ventured back to xanax. I'm at a point where I'm getting more guilt and shame again and I I'm about to graduate for substance abuse counseling. However I've never had to increase my dose for the last 15 years.,scared to death because my doctor has moved once again having to go through scrutiny after I get through this crippling anxiety that was so misdiagnosed and the mid 90' and still comes with a stigma,F,37,10  years.5 mg/1.mg,11/10/2015Email,Xanax

After trying so many different ssri's_ that only made me gain weight and actually CAUSED depression_ I realized that this is the ONLY drug that will let me live a semi normal life_ and allow me to leave my house and actually drive on the highway. I am prescribed 1 mg. 3x's a day_ but I only take a half mg 3x's a day due my the fear of addiction. Every once in a while I will have to take an extra half mg_ depending on the curcumstances.

You will feel better just knowing you have the ability to do something about your situation_ instead of a feeling of despair and hopelessness. That is just simply magnificent.

No wonder she fell on the floor and had to be carried several times to the bed she obviously didn't need the medication.  but for those of us that actually need the medication is because of our high anxiety level.

32, 5, Severe anexiety (social),People would notice I was sluggish in the morning_ however I never felt this way,Tried everything even other benzos then my doc gave me this. I had no idea it was addicting or the dangerous withdrawal symptoms. Left my script at parents when I went home for Christmas. I didn't want to drive back and get it so just figured if get it the next weekend. Two days later I had a seizure at work. This was 7 years ago. Now my problem is the high dose I was on for so long and started at such a young age my dependence is frightening and it's not working anywhere near like it used to. I read a study that since your brain is still developing until say age 24 my brain developed on this whopper of a starting dose of Xanax. I'm sorry to say I have to pick some up here and there to feel normal. I went one stent of 14 months without it and I never slept for more the two hours a night and didn't say more than two words to anybody. My brain simply wouldn't work. Just like it was not there. Couldn't do simple things like even watch tv because I had no idea what happened 30 seconds earlier. Does anyone know of any studys that talk about the brain developing on Xanax like mine did. To the point I could take 30MG in a day and not even feel tired. I am doing good making my prescription last and never run out early. But it is always on my mind. I have anxiety over my anxiety just over having my anxiety meds now.,M,37,10  years8 MG,7/29/2015Email,Xanax

No major_ concerning side effects.,This has worked wonders for me. I take it for hangovers when I'm anxious after drinking too much. I take it for public speaking (with Inderal... wonder drugs). I take it for situational anxiety like work meetings. I was worried about the addictiveness_ but I have taken less than 100 pills in 6 years. This is a wonder drug. In situations where I might be anxious_ I take comfort knowing it's in my pocket and normalcy is 15 minutes away_ if necessary.

I do not take it everyday and there have been times I haven't taken it for weeks_ there are other times when the panic takes over where I don't know how I'd survive without it.unfortunately I also have Emetophobia.   xanax helps somewhat but it's not a cure-all for my phobiaunderstand that if you have the chemical imbalance which causes panic attacks there may be times where it sounds like some of you are blaming the medicine instead of the disease.As someone who has taken it for 30 years_ I have learned that not every medicine works the same for every person.   to the people who actually wrote here that it should be banned you're not getting it.,F,53,10  years.5 usuall,5/8/2015,Xanax

I stopped that nonsense right away because I truly am debilitated without it. but I don't want anyone thinking oh yeah I got xanax no_ that's not good_ it does make some situations happier or calmer but if you're taking it properly you will get relief from your proper amount. all I'm sayin is don't abuse the privilege of having this helpful little pill in hand just be smart an use your meds safely,F,25,6  years3mg a day,4/17/2015Email,Xanax

This works most days but some days it is out of my control and i have to take xanax. It doesn't make me feel like a zombie_ it just calms me.

I only took one pill and my entire body felt the side effects within 30 minutes of taking the pill with a glass of water I was falling over and I kept feeling this weird feeling of paranoia as if someone was watching me and I was home alone with my fiance?. I was very uncomfortable and for the most part I wished my stomach ache would come back and that the feeling the pill have me would go away I couldn't see anything for a period of about 10 minutes and I don't remember eating or falling asleep my mind today the next day is completely blank after the pill had set in . My fiance? told me he had to pick me up off of the ground 2 times carry me to the bed and that he had to wake me up to check on me multiple times. I will not ever take one of those again. He thought I was going to die in my sleep.,I have also seen others taking this pill some with a prescription and some without one. And it is truly a dangerous drug and that's what scares me and my family so much about it_ it's easy to access far more easy then it should be.

47, 5, anxiety,None_ except for mild sedation.,I take it only as needed_ and aware of its addiction potential_ I take only one-quarter to one-half a .5 mg tablet. It's enough to dispel the anxiety and is a godsend.,M,71,5  years.5 mg 1X AN,12/25/2014,Xanax
48, 5, Panic & Anxiety,A little sleepy. A cup of tea helps.,Great for those who suffer with panic and anxiety. I am very glad this drug exists. With this_ you can control your panic. When you KNOW you can control your panic_ you may be less likely to panic. This can lead to a lesser need for the xanax. Knowing you can control the panic is an awesome feeling.,M,,1  months0.5 mg 1X D,12/23/2014,Xanax
49, 4, Panic Disorder,None,Xanax stopped my panic attacks in their tracks_ especially when dissolved under the tongue. For anxiety management on a day-to-day basis_ I felt my dose was not high enough to prevent -all- anxiety_ but it was strong enough to keep me from panicking. After taking more than my prescription allowed_ I felt calm and euphoric_ but unless I wanted to run out of my prescription early this was not something I did often. Occasionally I used it to help me sleep and it worked.,M,29,5  years0.5MG 2X D,12/17/2014Email,Xanax
50, 1, Anxiety,"Drowsie_ sleepy sometimes_ disconnected_ high_ little drunk feeling. Listen_ this should be used last case scenario for long term use. Ask yourself_ do you want to be on this forever? With everyday use_ it will become an addiction_ I promise with withdrawls being quoted as_ ""just as bad or worse then opioids (heroine)"" a credible source says. They make you dumb_ a zombie. again_ last resort drug with a doctor closely involved who really knows and understands addiction an benzodiazepines. Remember doctors often have zero first hand experience with taking the drug. A COLD TURKEY WITHDRAWL CAN RESULT IN DEATH. do you really need this? If yes_ good healthcare you will have long term is a must. Then withdrawls were the symptoms I took them for (panic_ depression_ anxiety). multiplied by 100. Plus new physical pains as well",It's a drug highly abused_ and the reason is it can take a very small time_ as little as a week_ depending on dose_ to become physically and mentally addicted,M,30,3  years2 mg,11/29/2014Email,Xanax
51, 5, panic disorder_ anxiety,drowsiness_ memory loss_,worked really good except made me feel too drowsy at times. felt sort of intoxicated like i drank a few beers. never any nausea or unpleasant effects. i took this as needed for about 1.5 years at different times. did not seem to last very long. imo one of the best medications for social anxiety.,M,30,18  months.5mg 3X D,11/23/2014Email,Xanax

55, 1, Heart palpitations,Terrible anxiety_ irrational fears_ iatrogenic illness that lasted for over a decade.,This drug worked beautifully. At first_ then it became a nightmare. Don't take it. Don't let anyone you care about take it. Please. This is a mind-altering_ highly addictive drug that changes the way your body calms itself down. So much so_ that you may never be the same_ even if you stop taking it. NEVER stop this drug 'cold turkey'. It is dangerous and can lead to a very painful withdrawal syndrome that can last years.

56, 3, anxiety attacks,Drowsiness_ irritability.,I took xanax 2 years ago_ but stopped because my anxiety attacks stopped as well. Now that my depression has gotten worse_ my anxiety attacks have come back even worse. It's only been a week back on them_ but I've noticed I've been becoming very irritable and quick to anger when the xanax starts to wear off. Even falling asleep sitting on the couch. I'm wondering if this will stop in time? I hope.,F,32,1  weeks.25mg 2x D,11/6/2014Email,Xanax

59, 3, panic depression,drowsiness_ clouding of the mind_ forgetfulness_ lethargy,It did relieve panic disorder for me but eventually it just made me lack energy and felt like doing nothing but stay at home all day. Has a mild antidepressant effect which I enjoyed at times. Getting off Xanax was unpleasant. It took two years to get it out of my system completely. I never want to take it again...not even occasionally.,M,50,7  years0.25 mg. 3X D,9/29/2014Email,Xanax
