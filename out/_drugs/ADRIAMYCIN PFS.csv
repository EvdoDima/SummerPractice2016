4, 5, breast cancer,A bit of fatigue_ massive hair loss. Tongue coating at night.  I actually tolerated the dose-dense A/C treatments very well.  Anti-nausea meds worked perfectly. Had sternum and leg bone pain as a result of Neulasta shots.  Took Rx painkillers for that.,Took Adriamycin/Cytoxin in four doses over eight weeks as neo-adjuvant therapy in order to save my breast.  WOW!  I couldn't believe how much it shrunk my tumor.  No doubt would have killed any budding metasteses if there had been any.
