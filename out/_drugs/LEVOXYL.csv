1, 1, Hashimoto,This stuff is crap. I can't even walk. Cramping and crying and anger. I could just scream. I am a diabetic with borderline hashimoto. Meaning my numbers have always been where they are. But they changed the qualifying numbers for hashimoto so now all of a sudden I have it. I dont believe everything they say. This is the second medication I've been on and both are worse than anything I ever felt without the meds,,F,49,2  weeks,4/11/2016Email,Levoxyl
2, 2, Mild Hypothyroidism,Horrible tendinitis in both Achilles tendons that went away 5 days after stopping Levoxyl. Went from hiking 5 miles in the mountains to barely able walk 3 blocks on the sidewalk. MAJOR weight gain. 15 pounds in 3 months- no previous weight problems. Will probably try Synthroid or Tyrosint next.,Levoxyl is Gluten Free while many other generics have gluten.,F,40,3  months25 mcg,6/20/2015,Levoxyl
3, 2, hashimotos thyroid,Persistent hair loss for nine months and not getting better.  Going to Dr today for a change.,This thyroid med may work for some but not for me.,F,68,9  months75 mcg,2/6/2015,Levoxyl
4, 5, low thyroid,None,Does a good job in bring my T3 & T4 in proper range. Very pleased.,M,65,10  years100 mg 1X D,11/23/2014,Levoxyl
5, 1, hypothyroid,dizziness_ fatigue_ headache_ insomnia_ heart palpitations_ depression_ weakness.,I hated it.   The day after I switched to Naturethroid_  all side effects were gone.   I still have to build up to enough of a dose_  but experiencing great relief.   Levoxyl gave me hyperthyroid symptoms_  even though I was not clinically hyperthyroid.,F,55,6  weeks125 1X D,9/11/2014Email,Levoxyl
6, 4, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis,No side effects unless dosage is too high or too low.,The drug has adequately controlled my thyroid condition,F,54, 112 mcg. 1X D,5/22/2014EmailHistory,Levoxyl
7, 3, hypothyroidism,Whole upper body pain numbness and stiffness with joint pain esp. in the morning.  Diminishes gradually but never completely. If it werent for this pain i'd love it. But before taking it i was so sick i couldnt get out of bed.  I traded one illness for another,,F,49,9  months100mcg,5/7/2013,Levoxyl
8, 4, Low Thyroid (Hypothyroidism),I had a slight increase in energy and appetite.,I did try Synthroid_ but it irritated my lungs.  This could be due to the dye in the Synthroid_ I'm not sure.  I called the Pharmacist and she said that Levoxyl probably had the least side effects of the Thyroid meds.  I tried it and had no problems.  I am still taking it today.  Just drink a lot of water with it_ since it can dissolve easily in your mouth.,M,49,1  years50 MCG. 1X D,3/5/2012,Levoxyl
9, 2, Hypopituitarism Hypothyroid,Hunger_ feel too hot when first take it and then too cold for the next 18 hours_ JOINT PAIN_ and non-improved hypothyroid symptoms.,I have been on every dose imaginable and sometimes combination with T3.  I still have syptoms of hypothyroid BUT feel even worse when I get frustrated and try to stop taking this.  (Reason for giving it a 2.)  According to blood tests my free T3 and free T4 and all other pituitary hormones are in normal range so not sure why my hypthyroid symptoms persist.,F,45,6  years175 mcg 1X D,2/17/2012,Levoxyl
10, 4, hashimoto's/hypothyroidism,none,i started on 25_ and now am on 25/50_ alternating.  i've seen improvements already_ and i was very_ very sick for years.  i think most of the people here who have complaints couldn't find the correct dosage_ or perhaps when starting this medication hypo symptoms appear/worsen for a short period before they get better?  i'm very happy with levoxyl.  it's gluten- and lactose-free_ it's well-regulated_ well-tolerated_ and seems to work well.,F,59,2  months25/50 alt 1X D,2/16/2012Email,Levoxyl
11, 1, Hashimoto thyroidusm,After having taken levoxyl for 8 months my arms started to get numb and I ended up with a terrible pain in the muscle in my upper right arm.  Plus we were always adjusting my dosage - one dosage would work for awhile and then we would have to either increase it or decrease it depending on returning symptoms.  I have since switched to Naturethroid and I feel great.  Arm pain went away_ as did the night sweats and general body achiness.,,M,55,1  years100 mcg 1X D,1/17/2012Email,Levoxyl
12, 4, Hypothyroidism,It sometimes has kept me awake_ but also slightly increased my appetite.  No other negative side effects.  Synthroid irritated my lungs (perhaps due to the dye in it) and Levoxyl seemed to have the least inactive ingredients.  So far_ it seems to have given me more energy.,No major (negative) side effects.  Synthoid irritated my lungs_ but Levoxyl worked fine.  I am pleased with it_ but you do have to drink it with plenty of water due to the fact that it dissolves in your mouth quickly.,M,49,1  years50 MG 1X D,10/24/2011,Levoxyl
13, 1, Hashmoto--hypothyroid,Horrible experience---not sure is my doctor's bad practice or the medication. when is a good endo? have seen two so far_ none of them are good and care about my experience. I was extremely ill after my doctor increased my dose from 25-50mcg. I fainted and went to ER twice and diagnosed with heart arrhythmia---multiple PVCs and PACs after seeing my cardiologist. I got very hungry and dizziness and had to laid down. Need to drink orange juice every 1-2 hours and feeling really sad and crying. I have to be home for months to recover from it. on top of that_ my cardiologist wanted me to take beta -blocker_ which can make my cardiac symptoms worse for my hypothyroid state. I am so glad I went to herbal for my heart arrthymia and I am fine now_ but get symptoms when I am stressed. My health is never the same any more!!!I have been off the medication for 5 month now_ but could not get back to 25mcg_ it gave me Symptoms of dizziness and hunger right away. I stopped immediately. During the pe,I tried Sythroid before levoxyl---because Sythroid gave me itchiness.,F,46,2  years25-50 mcg 1X D,4/22/2011,Levoxyl
14, 5, Hypothyroid after Grave Disease,None,After radioactive iodine treatment for Graves Disease_ my thyroid was disabled so I was prescribed Levoxyl. It took a little to get the right dose_ but it's working fine now. There are now noticeable side effects.,F,51,1  years112 mcg 1X D,1/22/2011,Levoxyl
15, 1, Under active thyroid,Tried Synthroid I thought I was going to kill my self.  Tried Unithroid hair fell out in clumps had white pimples on my face  constipation and very moody.  Now on Levoxyl hate it hate all of it. Constipation all the time horrible mood swings weight gain etc..etc.  Take it off the market all of it.  There has to be some alternative medicine out there if so many people are feeling the same.  Drs. don't care to hear how this drug makes you feel.  Ban all this S*%#!,,F,55,1.5  years.88 1X D,8/17/2010,Levoxyl
16, 2, Hypothyroid/Thyroidectomy,lethargic,Had emergency thyroidectomy.  Dr put me on Levoxyl 125 then up to 150.  I just never felt good.  Not blaming the medicine at all.  But she noticed that my levels were not maintaining_ so she since switched me to synthroid.  Much better.  She said sometimes certain drugs don't work on certain people.  Glad she noticed there was no change_ because I feel a lot better on Synthroid 200mcg.,F,35,3  months125mcg 1X D,7/3/2010Email,Levoxyl
17, 3, hypothyroid,Tired at times_ constipation_ some digestive problems_ seems to have aggravated other hormones_ some breathing difficulties.,It helped me more initially_ now I'm looking at additional options.  I do feel it helped my thyroiditis immensely quickly because I started having a reaction to a compounded formula that got dangerous.  With thyroid_ it's a learning experience as is life - finding what mix works for your body and mind.,F,39,3  months100 1X D,6/17/2010,Levoxyl
18, 1, To perhaps stop nodules from growin,horrible body aches similar to firbromyalgia pain all over could not raise my arms above my head.  As soon as I stopped it it went away.,Am interested in replacing Levoxyl with Armour Thyroid my daughter in law had same reactions as I did to Levoxyl on Armour Thyroid she feels great.,F,66,1.5  years25 mcg 1X D,2/25/2010,Levoxyl
19, 4, Hypothyroid,MORE ENERGY_ weight loss_ some joint pain,Had previously been on Armour Thyroid_ but the recent reformulation set me back. At this point in time_ it is very hard to obtain natural dessicated thyroid (due to backorders and issues with the FDA) so rather than dealing with all that_ I switched over to a Levoxyl Cytomel combination and am pleasantly surprised. The combination seems more consistent than the Armour and I've even dropped a little weight (which I couldn't do while on Armour_ despite diet and exercise). Levoxyl and Cytomel are working nicely and I have no plans to change anything.,F,41,2  months,11/2/2009,Levoxyl
20, 3, preclinical hypothyroid,fatigue_ hair falling out_ dry itchy scalp and skin_ always sleepy and tired_ hair breaking off,has helped me with having more energy. Still sensitive to cold_ depressed somewhat. I thought this medicine would bring my hair back but it looks horrible_ thin and dry_ worse than before I started. Been on it a year and still not at the correct TSH level.,F,70,1  years,10/13/2009,Levoxyl
21, 3, hypothyroidism,the texture of my hair has completely changed and I am constantly losing tons of hair. I want my old hair back. Besides that I have dry_ itchy skin. I thought this stuff was supposed to get better on the drug.,I have successfully lost and kept off any additional weight that I put on prior to being medicated which is good. I also have more energy. I would still rather switch to a natural thyroid treatment though.,F,29,6  years,10/2/2009,Levoxyl
22, 5, Falling asleep while driving,None,,M,57,10  years,9/8/2009,Levoxyl
23, 5, Hypothyroidism,Dry mouth. When the dose was incorrect I experienced heart palpitations and panic attacks,This drug saved me however_ it took about 2 years for me to feel like a normal person again after starting the drug. I have not had any problems with weight gain or loss. I will need to take this for the rest of my life.,F,30,9  years,8/7/2009,Levoxyl
24, 1, Hypothyroidism/Hashimotos,Muscle and joint pain_ hair fell out_ fatigue_ terrible weight gain_ carpel tunel_ tendinitis_ arrhythmia_ brain fog_ etc.,What a horrible drug. I took this drug for 20 years because I was told there wasn't anything else for my hypothyroidism. It never worked and eventually made me very ill. I couldn't even walk up our stairs to go to bed. I had to sleep downstairs on the couch. I know it was the Synthroid that caused me so much misery because I switched to Armour Thyroid two years ago and all my symptoms are gone. All of them!,F,50,20  years,4/4/2009,Levoxyl
25, 2, hypothyroid,none,I had no symptoms of hypothyroidism. I went to my dr. because of severe side effects of fosamax even 10 months after stopping medication. I was taking fosamax for ostiopenia. Levothyroxin can also cause thinning of bones so I am leary of taking it especially because I had no symptoms of hypothy.,F,,90  days,1/25/2009,Levoxyl
26, 3, Post-RAI Hypothyroidism,When I first started taking it (100 mcg)_ the sodium caused a lot of fluid retention and I felt as if I had consumed a lot of salt. If there was a way to manufacture this synthetic hormone with less sodium content_ it would be better.  I suspect that it raises my blood pressure but I try to keep that in check with exercise.,I have to take Levoxyl or another thyroid hormone due to thyroid ablation following a diagnosis of Graves Disease. I feel better on 50 mcg.  I was still having muscle pain_ soreness_ cramps_ twitches_ overall weakness and fatigue after being on Levoxyl for over a year.  I was not properly converting the T4 to T3.  My endo added Cytomel and the combination of that plus Levoxyl seems to work well for me.,F,52,1.2  years,7/29/2008Email,Levoxyl
27, 5, hypothyroid,,Stopped coughing and choking attacks discovered to be caused by enlarging thyroid pressing on trachea.,F,46,5  years,6/18/2008,Levoxyl
28, 5, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis,The only thing is it dissolves fast so I make sure to drink plenty of water with it.,I was on Synthroid for years and started having lactose intolerance issues with it. I have none on Levoxyl. Plus I think this medication works faster and better than Synthroid.If you want to lose weight because of weight gain caused by hypothyroidism you need to read about the Harris-Benedict Equation. Plug in your numbers and then you'll find out how many calories you need to eat per day just to sustain life. Many people trying to lose weight don't eat enough calories and starve themselves. As long as I eat enough calories_ exercise and do resistance training_ I lose weight quite easily.,F,54,1  months,6/3/2008,Levoxyl

32, 5, hypothyroid,None.  Had to bump up dose higher than doctor wanted to go_ but finally felt relief of hypothyroid symptoms,This drug works_ but exercise is key.  As a woman who is not in her 20's_ you HAVE TO EXERCISE to the point of pushing yourself.,F,34,10  years,11/9/2007,Levoxyl
