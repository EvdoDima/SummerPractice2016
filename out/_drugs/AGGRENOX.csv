0, 1, TIA,Follow up for post below....... Had to finally discontinue Aggrenox due to constant dull to mild headache and very bad tinnitus. I have been off the drug for 2 weeks and still have mild tinnitus especially after sleeping. I hope to get all of my hearing back to normal as more time passes. Headaches have also dissipated. Trying to get back to a normal feel.Switched to Plavix plus aspirin and have not had any side effects.... just hope it does the job as well.Aggrenox worked just the opposite for me. No excruciating headaches the first 2 weeks_ or tinnitus for that matter_ but as the weeks went by the I just couldn't seem to withstand the dosage_ or the diprydimol .,If your ears start ringing and the ringing continues to get stronger as the days go by_ you should really get off the drug. It could create lasting damage to your hearing.,M,59,6  months25 / 200 2X D,3/30/2014Email,Aggrenox
1, 3, followup for undetermined TIA,I didn't experience the intense headache initially. Had a bad headache hours following the TIA_ then on and off daily. When I began Aggrenox_ I could not tell if my headaches were residual from the TIA or the beginning of the medication_ but they were more of a nagging intensity_ with feelings of sinus pressure_ similar to vasodilation found when taking Viagra_ or a bad hangover. Steady_ daily_ nagging headaches followed as the months passed_after 2 months rather strong tinnitus developed_ and I am now still trying different ways to reduce or eliminate these.,At first_ my Dr. and myself agreed to try to split the drug....meaning separate aspirin and separate  full release dipyridamole. This actually created stronger headaches with tinnitus...pointing out that the source of the headaches and tinnitus was from the dipyridimole and not the aspirin. It also does not have the same therapeutic effect as the slow release form found only in Aggrenox.We then decidided to try stretching out the dosing and adding a low dose 81mg. aspirin to augment the spread out dose. At present I take one Aggrenox every 18hrs. and one low dose aspirin every 9 hrs. after. and so far the headaches have stopped and the tinnitus is at a minimum or gone and is less bothersome than before. We may try to push this to one every 15 hrs. and see if I can still remain headache and tinnitus free....so it`s still a work in progress.I am afraid to change to a different med at this point since Aggrenox has the best statistics for stopping additional TIA's..especially when no cause is found. Until some newer drugs can beat these statistics it's worth it to try and stay the course with Aggrenox_ but...the headaches and tinnitus are especially difficult to tolerate under the full dose.,M,58,4  months25/200 2X D,1/11/2014Email,Aggrenox
2, 1, Stroke,In hospital severe headaches_ which went away.  Now severe tinnitus.  I would rather die than have this rushing in my head.  I can't take it anymore.  I have gone to an audiologist_ neurologist_ accupuncturist.  No one can stop it and it never started until I started this medication.,,F,74,200  days 2X D,6/14/2012Email,Aggrenox
3, 2, Post stroke,The headaches for me were horrible. I was not supposed to take Excedrin any more with it_ but I actually sent my son out from the hospital to buy me some. I felt like my head was going to explode. Maybe it goes away after several days_ but I could not live with it. Went back on full dose of Plavix( that I was on for a MI 2 years ago) Works fine for me and the results of studies I looked at showed fewer hemmorhagic strokes with Plavix.,My neuro tried to tell me that this was a better drug than Plavix for stroke patients. I think he must have been reading what the drug reps gave him_ because my search on the internet showed the opposite along with a higher rate of hemmorhagic stroke with Aggrenox. Great_ no clots_ but my brain explodes. Thanks but no thanks.,F,60,3  days150 2X D,10/14/2011Email,Aggrenox

5, 2, Aggrenox,Dizziness_tintinnitus_effected vision _hearing_taste_ confusion_ other use of different drugs_ extreme coldness on side of hemi-paresis_ nausea briefly_ tiredness,Am going to stop using this drug but don't know how. The sudden discontinuance can cause seisure and death.  I have taken it along with Bacolfen. Metformin_ and Lipitor over the past year and had another stroke and various hosiptalizations- not good.  As soon as I know how_ I am going to stop this medication.,F,61,1  years,1/2/2010Email,Aggrenox
6, 1, Vertebral artery dissection/strokes,Rash upper chest and back_ intense itching_ especially at night.Two separate biopsies confirmed hive like rash due to drug reaction,Also had taken Lipitor.  Discontinued Lipitor but rash continued.  It is still possible the rash could be due to LipitorI'm posting now in case others get this rash.  Apparently it is not rare!
