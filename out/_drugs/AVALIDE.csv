1, 2, Hypertension,cough_ post nasal drip_ pounding heart beat_ sore throat_ dizzy_ possible insomnia (but not sure this wasn't due to worryinig about all the side effects)_ almost fainted once.,It did lower my blood pressue a bit and rather quickly_ but it didn't control it consistently throughout the day. My bp would be 110/69 after taking it and up to about 160/100 - 170/110 when it was close to the medication wearing off.,F,60,7  days12.5 1X D,12/4/2015Email,Avalide
2, 1, Hbp,I started taking Avalide when I was around 25....so about 13 years ago.  I never really linked the side effects to the drug until doing research online.   My main side effects have been tinnitus/constant ringing_ loss of smell and taste to a noticeable degree_ anxiety_ facial blushing due to the anxiety_ decrease in vision_ decreased libido.  I was also on Metoprolol concurrently for about the same number of years...I stopped taking metoprolol about 4 months ago cold turkey and my pressure did not go up at all.,I finally decided to stop taking this med and roll the dice.  I think after so many years on Avalide_ my tolerance has been built up that the drug is not working anymore and the side effects have gone on for too long.  I stopped as of today and will report back in a month or so.,M,38,13  years150/12.5 1X D,12/14/2014Email,Avalide
3, 3, HBP,What everyone else has said here. My gosh! And to think I was calling my doctor because the pharmacy did not carry the 300 mg version. I will definitely get off this crap and go back to HBP as not having a memory is just another slow death anyways. Never imagined that so many of us have this problem. Will call my attorneys to see if there are any class action lawsuits filed and if not to look at these comments and maybe start one.,,M,60,12  years150 1X D,7/17/2014,Avalide

6, 4, HTN,BP was 165/110 and Avalide almost immediately lowered it to 130/85 range. At first I didn't notice any side effects. Now I have multiple side effects which have gradually gotten worse. It is a diuretic so increased urination is part of what makes it work and not a side effect. I have increasingly noticed reduced libido_ poor memory_ depression_ joint pain_ stomach pain_ and inability to sleep more than about 4 hours at a time. Although I'm happy with the therapeutic effects of the med_ I need to see my doctor to weigh my options.,,M,47,4  years150/12.5,3/23/2013Email,Avalide

10, 3, High Blood Pressure,Primarily lower back pain.,This medication was excellent at reducing my blood pressure; however_ after the recall_ Bristol Myers increased the strength.  My pharmacist brought to my attention the new smaller pill when I picked up my new prescription about a week ago.  Since taking the new Avalide pill_ I immediately began to feel lethargic_ depressed and have increased hair loss.  I did some research on the web and found this website.  I started to read the side effects suffered by people taking Avalide and realized that for months before the recall I've had lower back muscle weakness.  I put 2 and 2 together and came to the conclusion that this medication has been causing problems all along.  It only took Bristol Myers increasing the strength for all of the symptoms to become magnified.  I immediately called my cardiologist.  Hopefully_ there is an alternative.,F,51,18  months150/12.5 1X D,8/26/2011Email,Avalide
11, 2, hypertension,fatigue+++ muscle and joint pain_ body aches generally_ heart palpitations_ numbness and tingling to hands and feet and new sudden feelings of depression because of my inability to function day to day because of my symptioms.,My doctor sent me to specialists (neurologist and internal medicine ) I was tested and seen for fibra myalgia_ autoimmune disorders and other disease processes that result in similar symptoms_ every lab work and test came back perfect.  She prescribed me antidepressants and I was insulted...  I am a Reg. Nurse and mother of 3_ I stuggled to keep up most days.  My doctor finally gave up on me.  After researching Avalide_ I realized that I have felt crappy for the same amount of time I've been on the drug. My blood pressure isn't even that much better.  I've stopped taking it for a little over one week now and my body aches are 80% better and I'm not near as tired...Is this coincidental or what!!!,F,37,2.5  years300/25 1X D,3/17/2011,Avalide
12, 4, High Blood Pressure,This was working fairly well on my BP. Yes_ it did make me very tired a first. Fatigue somewhat went away. Hard to lose weight when taking this too. I just went to try to get a refill and found out that they are not making Avalide right now from the manufacturer??  So now they are going to put me on Avapro with the Hydrochoro diuretic as an extra pill. Why is this? makes me wonder was the Avalide safe for me?,Also_ why is the doctor handing out samples of a drug that they are not making?,F,52,5  months12.5mg 1X D,3/2/2011,Avalide
13, 1, hypertension,loss of sexual desire is CERTAIN !! Beware! And more importantly_ if you have IBS/IBD_ such as crohn_ ulcers or colitis_ stop taking this medicine_ it makes you bleed. Other than these_ it drops your BP.,,M,42,30  days 1X D,2/26/2011,Avalide
14, 4, Hypertension,I was taking Diovan HCT 160/12.5.  Worked well for awhile but my BP started creeping up.  Doctor then put me on Avalide 300/12.5_ one tab in the morning.  Great results and results are still good.  However_ I do notice a common complaint by others also taking Avalide and that's muscle pain.  After 1 year on Avalide_ I started noticing terrible muscle cramps of the extremities (hands and feet mostly).  After reading all this_ I am more and more suspicious Avalide is causing the cramps.  So_ other than some other medication that works for me as well as Avalide_ what are my present options? Well_ I can put up with the muscle cramps OR run the risk of a stroke due to uncontrolled hypertension.  As a side note_ in my personal experience_ most doctors seem to be quite hesitant to point an accusing finger at any medication.,,M,70,2  years300-12.5 1X D,2/20/2011,Avalide

Avalide does control my blood pressure.,Prior to reading several websites_ I never attributed any of the side effects I was having to Avalide.  Now I know that frequent urination is a definite side effect.  No one has mentioned a reduction in TASTE_ which I am experiencing the more I am on this drug.

19, 1, Blood Pressure,I had been taking Labetalol HCL 200 MG twice daily for some time and my blood pressure started to get higher. My current doctor added Avallide to help with this and I soon began too have severe joint pain and stomach upset. He than added a narcotic pain reliever to help. I have now quit taking Avalide and feel better. I have also quit taking the pain meds. So far I seem to feel alot better. I will be going to a different doctor.,Beware of Doctors on the take.

21, 1, High BP,I have no idea how it effected my BP but after 2 days of talking this medication I was feeling horrible. I couldnt figure out why I had dizziness_ confusion_ extreme fatigue_ leg cramps and stomach aches. My usual ringing in my ears increased dramatically. I continued it for 5 more days before I have decided that it has to be the Avalide and the side effects are unbearable. I have gone back to my old medication and I am calling my doctor in the AM.,,M,60,6  days25 1X D,8/7/2010,Avalide
22, 3, High Blood Pressure,Avalide controlled my BP very well after many tries with other medications. Until the last 6 months of taking the drug_ the only side effects I had experienced were a fast pulse rate and leg and foot cramps.  However_ I began having severe angio-edema_ which is facial swelling_ extreme redness and itching with no rash.  I looked horrible.  After eliminating everything and trying them 1 at a time - it was the AValide.  This is listed as one of the major allergic reactions to all Angiotension Receptor booster drugs. I am currently trying to find a new drug that lowers my BP without swelling up and itching!,"Avalide is the only drug I have taken for my BP that held my pressure steady throughout the day.  I am 5'6"" tall and weight 120 lbs so weight is not an issue.  I can have normal BP and an hour later it is in 150 range.  Avalide maintained me between 115/70 to 125/70.  But I did find the high pulse rate caused shortness of breath when I was rushing about. Off the Avalide I have none of these symptoms_ but I can't find a new medication that works.",F,67,3  years300/25 1X D,7/21/2010Email,Avalide

I even went to an Ear_Nose and Throat Specialist thinking i had an inner ear infection causing my balance problems.,For me Avalide is not worth taking because of all the side effects.

I started out with Avapro 5 years ago_ yet was placed on Avalide 300/12.5 3 years ago. Work related stress and age was increasing my blood pressure. I am also on generic lopressor_ but that's due to my recent MI and not BP control. Avapro and Avalide gave no side effects. My Dr stated he used it often for patients not controlled by generics.

I also have extreme tinnitis (ringing in the ears).  I have had ongoing digestive problems...I feel like a wreck!!!
