0, 1, High TSH levels,Tired_ cold all the time_ always wanted to sleep_ ridiculous weight gain_ no energy_ no will and really ignoring side effects there just are no benefits,"I found zero benefit to taking levothyroxine.  The goal of this drug is to completely shut down your thyroid and replace your natural hormone with a synthetic one. It just makes your pituitary think you have plenty of hormone (T4) and therefore doesn't need to tell your thyroid to make any. I am mad that I ever started on this stuff.  I'd like to know who decided what the ""normal"" range is_ or how the solution is to cause your thyroid gland to stop working.  I made the decision against my docs arguments to go off of this T4 drug.  I am now trying the active form_ T3.",F,46,8  years100mcg 1X D,7/6/2016Email,Levothyroxine sodium
1, 1, Hypothyroidism,A lot of Hair falling out faster_ memory has gotten much worse_ caused my blood sugar to rise until doctors think I have Type 2 Diabetes_ I can't put much weight on my hips or walk very much without terrible pain_ increased Depression and anxiety_ more things that I can't think of right now.,When I was on Armour Thyroid_ it helped all of my bodily systems work correctly_ but Levothyroxine doesn't help my bodily systems to work correctly_ but instead causes more problems as I listed in the side effects column. I am trying to get my doctors to change me back to Armour Thyroid. Hopefully these doctors will where as my former doctors at a certain HMO wouldn't.,M,61,13  years100 MCG 1X D,5/12/2016,Levothyroxine sodium
2, 1, Hypothyroid,Extremely crippling & painful joint pain (knees)_ tremors_ muscle spasms_ depression_ body aches_ neuralgia_ some suicidal thoughts.,In the form of Tirosint - Have taken this for 12 weeks.  Was originally on 50 mcg of the generic form of Levothyroxine and had only minor problems_ mostly did well.  Was switched to Tirosint after my TSH was good.  Was fine until 6 weeks in.  At six weeks my right foot began to ache. (I thought it was my shoes) Debilitating nerve pain came in both my feet at 7 weeks.  9-10 weeks in the nerve pain in foot subsides_ comes and goes_ but right knee begins to feel loose_ weak. At 11 weeks right knee pain (aches_ cramplike) has become extremely painful.  Pain has spread to left knee.  Also_ experiencing tremors_ muscle spasms all over body and aches at night.  Have been off of Tirosint for 4 days.  Hoping for improvement once medication leaves my body.  Pain has been so crippling & debilitating I'd considered quitting my job_ but the depression gets to be too much when I'm alone. I wish doctors would fully explain the chance of significant deterioration of health & lifestyle when they prescribe these medications.  I read a entry on one of these boards where a patient's doctor told her these meds tend to pool_ collect in the joints.  Still hoping for the best.,F,40,12  weeks25 mcg 1X D,10/20/2015Email,Levothyroxine sodium
3, 1, Low thyroid levels,Blinding headaches; horrible insomnia; hair loss daily; fainting spells; facial swelling; double vision; high blood pressure; debilitating hip pain.,Took Armor thyrid 14 years with no problems. Dr. decided he wouldn't prescribe it anymore and prescribed levothyroxine though I told him I couldn't take it before. Insomnia_ headaches_ and a feeling of being unwell began within two days. Took it 3-4 days and stopped 3-4 days so I could sleep_ as the insomnia would keep me up for days. At 3 months_ he changed it to Synthroid. No improvement and left hip hurt. At 6 months_ changed it to Levoxyl. 2nd day all sleep stopped and headache was horrible and hair was falling out. Day 3 fainting spells started. Day five facial swelling_ double vision_ and hip pain so severe I couldn't walk. Went to the Mayo Clinic website to see if any of it was due to Levoxyl (which is another name for levothyroxine). All were listed. Was surprised to see hip pain on the side effect list as it hadn't occurred to me it could be a side effect all those months. Have been through heck. Took 3 months for headaches_ insomnia_ and double vision to lesson a bit. Hair stopped falling. Blood pressure is still a little high 5 months later. Others left more quickly except hip pain which has put me in a wheelchair and cost me a fortune in specialists and expensive testing. Awaiting latest results now. Doctor put me on oxycodone and flexeril to try to make life bearable while this is figured out. It has been and remains a nightmare.,F,60,7  months50 mg,6/3/2015Email,Levothyroxine sodium
4, 1, hypothyroidism,Severe depression and anxiety.  Mood  swings.,After first being diagnosed with hypothyroidism at age 52 which I am convinced developed in childhood or at birth_ I really looked forward to finally having a normal energy level.I began to realize the longer I took it the worse I felt.It peaked with rapid mood swings going from feeling fairly normal to severely depressed with anxiety so severe Xanax barely phased it.All this in 4-12 hour cycles. Then the depression and anxiety never left until I flushed the synthroid down the toilet. A literal nightmare which by the way was another bad side effect. Vivid nightmares and waking up to severe depression for 15_20 minutes.,M,52,2  months50 MG,11/26/2014,Levothyroxine sodium
5, 4, Autoimmune hypothyroidism,Hair loss_ all over but especially noticeable near the front of my head (my part has widened a lot since I started taking this medication. I'm a bit worried that I might end up being bald eventually). I had no symptoms of hypothyroidism before I began this medication (it was found on a routine blood test) so I have not noticed any other changes as I had no symptoms to begin with. I wish it would have helped me with weight loss at least_ but no such luck! At least it's a tiny pill_ so it's easy enough to take.,,F,24,5  months0.75 mg,10/1/2014,Levothyroxine sodium
6, 1, Underactive Thyroid,This caused irritation in my lungs that was not relieved by taking Aciphex.  It was only relieved by taking Clarinex (5 mg.).  This could be due to an inactive ingredient in it that I am allergic to.  It contains glycerin which is made up of:  Palm oil_ coconut oil_ rapeseed oil and sunflower oil.  It does NOT contain dyes.,I took Tirosint (50 mcg.)_ which is made by Akrimax Pharmaceuticals.  The symptoms abated after I took an antihistamine and stopped taking the Tirosint.,M,51,4  days50 mcg. 1X D,10/29/2013,Levothyroxine sodium
7, 1, hypothyroidism,hip pain,Began taking 50mcg and noticed minor pain in joints mainly hip.Had labs done in six weeks and dosage was doubled to 100mcg.  Within a day or two hip pain became debilitating and I was forced to use a walker just to move from one room to another.  Pain was extreme but was told by my Dr. it could not be the levothyroxine.  Knowing myself that it was_ I bought a pill cutter and cut my pills in half.  Within 6 days I was walking fine and almost pain free.  I am now on Armour Thyroid along with the 50mcg of levothyroxine and hope to discontinue it in the near future.,F,62,4  months50mcg 1X D,12/23/2012Email,Levothyroxine sodium

10, 4, ,,After being on Armour for 2 years and experiencing a return in my symptoms I reluctantly decided to switch back to levothyroxine.  Soo thankful I did that.  I immediately noticed an increase in energy and began to feel like my old self.  After a few weeks I had cytomel 5mcg 2x a day added and I also noticed that helped a lot as well.,F,24, 150 mcg 1X D,8/27/2011Email,Levothyroxine sodium
11, 1, Hypothyroidism,Terrible aches in joints_ especially hips_ knees ankles_ wrists.  Pains in muscles_ inflammation of muscles and joints_ extreme pain on walking in hips.  swollen ankles all the time.,I was put on Levothyroxine for Hypothyroidism and at first it was not bad_ but after a few months I developed extreme pain when walking in hips and knees_ I couldn't walk and put on 5 stone in weight which I am now trying to get off.  I also had Achilles Tendonitis and Plantar Fasciitis in foot (all inflammatory disorders) in all it had an allergic reaction in my body where I had extreme inflammation in joints and muscles.  I had blood tests that proved I had way over the top inflammation i.e. the top rate of normal was 13 and mine was 35 which the doctor told me was Inflammatory Arthritis_ he then referred to me a Rheumatologist who also did many many blood tests and X-rays of my feet_ ankles_ wrists and hands_ but he couldn't find the reason why I had inflammation in my body_ he then referred me back to my doctor who was stumped!  I decided to try natural dessicated thyroid preparation as some people I had read about in books and on the internet cannot tolerate synthetic thyroxine_ I thought this was probably the problem as others had been through the same thing and natural dessicated thyroxine had saved them from being in a wheel chair and crippled in so much pain like I was and I could hardly walk it was so painful.  I am now taking natural dessicated thyroxine and the pains have become so much less than they were_ even I felt 100% cured.  But some doctors are sceptical about natural dessicated thyroxine_ but if it cures you then why not!  I also think that it will take t,F,50,2  years150 mg 1X D,4/5/2011Email,Levothyroxine sodium
