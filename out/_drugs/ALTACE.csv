My BP jumped up to 176/110 the second week and I went to the ER cause it would not come down and the chest pain..thought It was a heart attack.This stuff sucks and there are too many side effects for it to be considered safe.

I felt better within a day_ but it took several days for my face to return to normal.,Altace was prescribed to lower my BP and protect my heart and kidneys_ and my doctor didn't think this was a side effect of altace.

I do agree with the following person about doctors being to lazy to find the underlying reason for high BP! I do smoke 1 pack a day so the doctor assumes this is the problem with no other testings. I am sure this is not helping my high BP but for being a constrution worker and in good shape I beleive there is another reason. My BP was at average 151 over 91.

51, 4, High Blood Pressure,Further update to my last post on 9/17/2008.I decided to stick with the Tritace. The fatigue has largely gone (they say that this is common when you first start any high blood pressure medication). I was going to try Norvasc_ but heard too many bad reports about legs swelling etc. Going to see if the libido improves now that the fatigue is gone.Sticking with Tritace for now. BP seems to be under control on just 2.5 mg.,If you dont have a bad cough then stick with this drug as the fatigue will improve over time. The doc can always start you on a smaller dose and slowly work your way up.I am on 2.5 mg but might have been better for me to start on the 1.25 mg in the first couple of months.,F,31,15  months,9/29/2008,Altace
52, 3, High Blood Pressure,Dosage 2.5 mg commenced to treat high blood pressure. In the first month noticed the following: occasional cough (but not enough to stop the drug)_ very dry throat on a couple days_ reduced libido_ considerable fatigue - couldn't seem to keep my eyes open past 9-10pm when ordinarily I required very little sleep. Due to the tiredness_ results in snoring on occasion.After a little time_ things seemed to settle down - I no longer had the cough_ didnt experience a dry throat_ my body adapted to the fatigue and I can now keep awake past 9pm :)Next steps: am going to try a new drug as the libido has only improved slightly. Was going to consider halving the dose but Doc has suggested that I try NORVASC for a few weeks to see how this goes (fingers crossed).,The brand used was Tritace (Ramipril) which is the same drug as Altace.,F,31,15  months,9/17/2008,Altace

57, 1, congestive heart failure,Severe dizziness and fatique with pins and needles feeling in my hands_ actually fell down while on a walk because of the vertigo.,I have gotten so dizzy that I almost fell several other times. My doctor keeps ignoring my side effects and I will probably have to go to another doctor.,M,86,120  days,5/10/2008Email,Altace
58, 2, M.I. AGE 27 / LOW EF,I would first get a slight headache if I were to forget to take this med. Then about a year ago I started to get a slight twitch around my left eye and it just got worse. I went to a neurologist_ my medical doctor neither could figure it out. I noticed it got really bad about an hour after taking my heart medications. I stopped one while taking the others and I noticed when I stopped the Altace the muscle cramps and twitching went away.,I have to go to my Cardiologist to let them know what the symptoms I had been experiencing with this medication. I had been taking Altace for about 6 - 7 years before these symptoms started to show up.,M,39,7  years,5/4/2008Email,Altace
59, 5, High blood pressure,None,I started this med with the lowest dose and moved up slowly to 5mg and then to 10mg which stabilized the BP at a reasonable level... 120-130/80-85. That was about 5 years ago and so far so good.,M,65,5  years,3/31/2008,Altace
