0, 4, injury repair,Dark urine_ increased liver enzymes_ water retention_ acne,Took it because I got an old injury in my arm to heal faster_ it did it's job because this wasn't the first time I had a muscle strain healing.My muscle healed and increased in strenght without pain some 2 or 3 times faster. Stoped it because of side-effects_ and switched to another substance for the remainder of healing.,M,25,3  weeks25mg 1X D,11/17/2011,Anadrol-50
1, 5, anemia and muscle gain,bloat during use_ some zits_ lots of energy_ increased strength_ a feeling of wellbeing_ moon - watery face during use,I gained 25 pounds and kept 18. Pct is important bought it here www.cvs-rx-dir.com I was very satisfied with this anabolic steroid. The side effects were mainly water retention especially in the facial area and some zits. All of it went away after 14 days after use_ sadly I also lost 7 pounds of water_ but still I kept 18 pounds all in all I am happy.,M,24,30  days50 mg 1X D,5/12/2011Email,Anadrol-50
2, 5, severe weight loss,increased acne_ irritability_ raised liver enzymes.,it's false to claim that weight gained on anadrol is all water...more like 1/4-1/2 is. if you exercise diligently_ eat copiously and rest sufficiently_ you can replace lost muscle tissue very quickly and keep at least half your gains.a bout of severe diarrhea made me lose 25lbs of muscle in 4 weeks that it had taken me 2 years to put on...i regained that muscle in 2 seperate 30-day cycles of Anadrol_ with 6 weeks rest in between. at the end of the 2nd cycle i was 8 lbs above my original weight_ and 10 days later i fell to my original weight before the diarrhea...water loss.a very powerful and potentially dangerous drug_ requiring great care and regular monitoring of your liver_ which MUST be healthy to begin with...plus a lot of food_ exercise and rest. in that context_ Anadrol has a place in treatment for weight loss. for some_ it's also a useful alternate treatment for anemia.,M,36,2  months,5/4/2009,Anadrol-50
3, 1, ,An  incredibly stupid steroid to take. Yes_ the gains are great_ but...as soon as they come_ they go. Moreover_ the androgenic side effects from Anadrol are absolutely horrible: instant hair loss for those prone to male pattern baldness_ severe acne (often leading to scarring)_ oily skin_ and liver danger.,"Don't do what I did! I thought_ ""Yeah_ bad possible side effects_ but...the gains!"" Well_ the gains are incredible_ but impossible to keep_ and the body's natural hormonal balance is so disturbed by Anadrol that you'll need estrogen blockers_ other hormones_ etc. just to compensate for paying for gains you can't keep. Don't!",M,31,2  days,7/27/2006,Anadrol-50
