0, 5, High IOP,Alphagan helps to whiten my eyes which are bloodshot from taking Timolol (twice/day)and Travatan (once/day) . No other side effects.,,M,63,18  months1 drop 3X D,6/9/2011Email,Alphagan
1, 1, glaucoma,Tachycardia.  Also_ left arm and leg went 'heavy' and felt like they had bloodpressure cups on them.  That lasted 2 weeks.,One drop in right eye and 1/2 an hour later I was on my way to the ER for the worst cardiac incident of my life.  Huge Tachycardia and I think I must have had a mild stroke as well.,F,48,1  days1 drop 1X D,7/15/2010Email,Alphagan
2, 2, Glaucoma,Alphagan P lowered the eye pressure but caused VERY bloodshot eyes_ puffy_ red lids and extreme drowsiness...almost like narcolepsy. I've had the SLT (laser surgery) in one eye and will have SLT in the other so I won't have to take drops.,I took the drops about 6 weeks and the doctor told me to stop a couple weeks ago.  They also caused anxiety. Go to webMD to see all the side effects. Some are severe.,F,73,45  days,12/12/2009Email,Alphagan
3, 2, glaucoma,I forgot to add in my previous review that the AlphaganP SPIKED my blood pressure which had been under very good control with clonidine HCL.  On Alphagan my BP went to 173/105 !! I had to increase my BP meds to 3 times a day.,Alphagan made me very drowsy and so does clonidine_ so the increased dose of clonidine to counteract the elevated BP caused by AlphaganP made me fall asleep suddenly at any moment.  Now that i've stopped the Alphagan_ my BP is slowly coming down. I didn't realize that Alphagan could increase my BP until i read it on webMD,F,73,45  days,12/12/2009Email,Alphagan
4, 1, Glaucoma,This was prescribed as an addition to Betoptic suspension as pressures failing to respond.The Alphagan caused red_ sore eyes within a week of starting and a feeling of something in the eyes. Vision was blurred which gave me a slight feeling of disorientation.Constant waking up in night_also felt depressed. Initially pressures decreased from 24 to 18_ but thereafter actually increased to 28 and 30.So what's the point.,Not happy with Alphagan.,F,63,60  days,10/6/2009,Alphagan
5, 1, glaucoma,Extreme allergic reaction: red_ itchy_ oozing eyes_ fluid-filled pouches under eyes_ severe blurring of vision.,Also tried the supposedly less allergenic Alphagan P. Same problem. After 1 drop_ I turned into the 100-year-old woman.,F,60,1  days,2/1/2009,Alphagan
6, 2, Ocular Hypertension,Ocular pressures were in the low 20s - so slighly above normal.  Opthamologist prescribed Alphagan P - blood shot eyes causing blurriness.  Finally went to another Doctor who diagnosed the problem and it took 6 weeks for the blurriness to resolve itself.  New doctor is taking a let's watch it approach to my pressures and changing my contacts.,,M,36,4  months,11/21/2007,Alphagan
7, 1, open angle glaucoma,Red_ itchy_ burning allergic eyes; very dry sinuses_ nose and mouth_ throat -- uncomfortably so_ but got better after a week. The red_ itchy_ burning allergic eyes did not improve at all.,I took aphagan and was very allergic to it.  Later_ I tried Alphagan-P_ which has a different preservative and is less prone to reactions.  I still had allergy problems and dryness with it.  It also didn't lower the pressure any.,F,58,3  weeks,11/17/2007,Alphagan
8, 1, To reduce Intra-Ocular Pressure (IO,Added to Timolol to reduce IOP.  Disturbed sleep; would wake up twice a night. Affected metqboloism_ felt sleepy.
