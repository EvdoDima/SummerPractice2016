0, 5, Muscle Spasms Spinal Cord Stenosis,,I don't know how I could have survived the past ten years without this wonder drug. I have never abused it and it's the only thing that has given me any sort of quality of life. For those that are prone to drug abuse of any kind I can see how it could be dangerous_ but for those of us who actually suffer from life long debilitating pain from muscle spasms it's a god send.I've recently had two level acdf surgery and I've had to bump up the dosage a bit_ but if all goes well I should be able to go back to my normal dosage.,F,52,9  days,10/16/2006,Soma compound
1, 5, Neck and shoulder spasms_ back pain,I have been taking Soma_ off and on_ for over 10 years and occassional drowsiness is the only side effect I've even experienced...but even that is dependent upon other circumstances_ such as time of day and whether I take it with food or alone.,SOMA is one of the most effective muscle-relaxant drugs I have ever taken. Chemically_ I know that the drug does not really act directly on muscles_ but instead acts on the brain pathways. Regardless of the actual process_ the effect is still to relieve muscle tension and the pain that accompanies muscle spasm.It is a drug that could be addictive if you overdose on it and like the effect of being in a drunken stupor_ which is an awful feeling top begin with. Howeever_ when taken properly Soma is not addictive at all_ IMHO_ but then again_ I have never been addictive to anything_ either medicinal or non-medicinal. Considering that I have been taking Soma for over 10 years_ I can skip taking Soma for extended periods w/o any withdrawl symptoms at all.It is a wonderful medication_ and when combined with analgesics_ the effect is synergistic and complimentary.,M,58,10  years,5/31/2006,Soma compound
