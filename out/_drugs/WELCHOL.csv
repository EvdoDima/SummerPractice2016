1, 1, High Cholesterol,Mild headache_ gas_ diarrhea_ joint and muscle pain_ severe sinus drainage_ severe fatigue_ loss of appetite.,After only 8 days of using this medication_ my quality of life has gone to ZERO.After only 8 daysI have discontinued it and hope to recover soon. I lost 5 pounds_ can't sleep due to gagging and choking on the sinus drainage that continues non-stop day and night_ have no energy and can only think about getting home to sleep_ oh but I CAN'T. Based on ratings it seems this works well if you had your gall bladder removed_ but I can't live like this for a marginal reduction of cholesterol if any. The only thing worse about the statin I used prior_ is less leg pain. With Welchol everything hurts.,M,57,8  days3.75 MG 1X D,5/27/2016Email,Welchol

5, 4, High ldl,Slight muscle cramps in my lower legs. I had a couple of nightmares. My stools got harder_ so I started eating prunes_ which helped a little. I thought that I might become constipated_ but stopped the med due to the cost.,I had gotten terrible leg pains after taking lipitor for one week. I refused to take another prescription statin and instead took Red Yeast Rice. When my ldl started to go up_ I asked my doctor for an alternative_ which was Welchol. The drug store charged me less money for my 1 month supply. The next month they wanted to charge me about 3x as much. I could barely afford the original amount and definitely could not pay the higher fee. I got my insurance to agree on letting me get a half month supply. After seeing my doctor_ 6 weeks later_ she gave me 5 mgs of Crestor. After a month of that I quit due to multiple bad side effects. I am going to just keep working on improving my diet now.,F,61,6  weeks2500 mgs/d,12/2/2015,Welchol

Am an active runner and biker.  Had to stop both these activities when on Statins (severe side effects).  No major side effects with Welchol but cholesterol is still above 200 on it even when I was taking the full 6 pills a day.

Taking Welcohl on recommendation of my doctor as I am not able to take statins due to liver problems.,I hate this medication_ but will seek doctor's recommendation.  High cholesterol and 2 previous heart attacks make it imperative to keep cholesterol low.

19, 1, High Chol.,After being poisoned by 2 statin drugs(prevstatin and simvastatin) my Dr. gave me a RX of Welchol.  $240. for a box of powder packets!  I'm a VERY sensitive person with drugs_ I would've loved a free sample first.  There is a site where you can get a free sample of this drug.  I was warned to only take a pinch of it_ on a empty stomach .... OMG ... I took a 1/4 teasp. I was sick/nausea_ achy_ spacey all day.  Then I took a 1/8 teasp. with food_ much better_ but then my ears started ringing loudly and I had horrible insomnia while trying  it.  I also thought I had the flu(tired_achy body_ upset stomach)_ but now reading the other posts_ I think it was another side effect of this drug .... I'm afraid to try and take it again.  There just has to be a better way than these drugs!  You have NO quality of life while on them.,,F,60,7  days1/8 teasp 1X D,2/17/2014Email,Welchol

21, 5, Dr. recommended,Welchol has made me normal again_ able to live without looking for the nearest bathroom. No side affects as of yet. Just more energy and no longer losing weight.,I love Welchol. I went from a size 20 to a size 12 in like a 4 month span from constant diarrhea. My regular dr. couldn't find anything to account for it and sent me to a specialist. I suffer no side effects that others have experienced_ thankfully. My energy is back and the headaches and shakes I was having due to diarrhea are gone.,F,54,18  days625 mg 6X D,5/31/2013Email,Welchol

23, 1, High LDL,CONSTIPATION_ bloating_ nasua,"46 yr old petite female. Family history of heart disease. Total cholestorol of 255 LDL 156 HDL 80 Triglycerides 94. Not bad but doc concerned about LDL. Tried statin last yr. Horrible joint pain. Changed diet to exclude almost all dairy (my beloved icecream!) and changed workouts. HDL went up_ Tri's went down_ LDL still high. Thought we'd try this little pack of powder once a day. Did not read the side effects as like most_ I tend to think I ""might"" be having an effect? Five days in and OH MY! Thought I had a touch of the stomach flu going around but everyone with the ""bug"" was rushing to the potty. NOT ME! Stomach upset_ bloating_ nasua_ and miserable. Up until last week_ you could set the worlds clock on my daily BM's. Constipation is beyond anything I've ever experienced! I've always felt bad for family and friends that have dealt with this but I now know first hand how horrible this is! Three days after last drinking a packette of WELCHOL I am still not ""normal""! Stool so hard it might as well be concrete! It's the little things in life we take for granted. Tried prune juice with butter_ no luck. Hoping this will ""pass"" soon and I get back to living a normal life. I'm ok with living with high LDL. If I pass because of heart disease so be it. I will pass happy and enjoying life! Not sucking down one drug to do one thing and taking four more to counteract the one! Not to mention_ I've had to skip my workouts because I'm so bound up!

24, 5, Bile Salts diarrhea,Sometimes I feel bloated and have muscle aches.,I had my gall bladder removed in 2011.  I take one of these as needed when stomach is acting up. It has really helped.

25, 5, chrone's disease,headaches once a week. muscle weakness\soreness. impotence,This drug was prescribed for regeular diarreah and 15+ trips to the bathroom a day. My life was ruled by locations of the closest facilities. Im very active and my work is very physically demanding which led me to discover this muscle weakness and need for extra sleep daily once on welchol. An issue with my mojo was also directly noticed! Other than an occasinal C.D. bout this drug has changed my life to fewer than 5 restroom breaks a day! WHEW! I can now live a mostly normal life which I lost to C.D. 20 yrs ago!,M,33,1.5  years 2X D,11/18/2011Email,Welchol
26, 3, High Cholesterol - genetic,constipation_ indigestion_ constantly stopping up toilet!,I took only half the dose given to me because I am very prone to side effects.  It did lower the numbers even with half the dose_ but not enough.  I can't imagine if I had taken the full dose of 6 pills.,F,51,3  months3 pills 1X D,7/23/2011,Welchol
27, 2, chronic diahrrea,Awful bloating_ gassy_ generally quite uncomfortable.,This stuff does control my diahrrea so that I can now leave the house and live a more normal life_ but I feel as if I've been stuffed all the time an can eat only a few mouthfuls before I feel terrible.

29, 2, High Cholesterol,Constipation_ gas_ bloating,I read the normal dose was six 625mg pills a day. My dr put me on two twice a day. I was taking it because of high cholesterol/LDL and I am a 15 year CABG survivor and cannot tolerate statins. I am normally very regular_ but this stuff made me plug up like concrete. I felt bloated and had bad gass_ and when I did go I bled like a stuck pig. After two episodes of that I gave the drug up and regularity returned in a few days. Also no more rectal bleeding. I'm trying to control my numbers now with diet and Niaspan.,M,60,2  weeks,11/24/2009Email,Welchol

31, 5, high cholesterol,Moderate gas and constipation...much worse at high altitude.,It works.  My cholesterol and LDLs have dropped to very low levels and I can eat pretty much what I want but still watch my diet.,M,63,3  years,3/13/2009,Welchol
32, 2, High Cholestrol,I had no side effects while on Welchol.,It didn't lower my cholestrol at all. The LDL totals went up big time (bad) along with HDL (good). I watch my fat and sugar intake. If this drug had worked I would have stayed on it. I didn't even mind the 6 horse size pills a day. I can't tolerate statins. They make my brain numb and my muscles weak. I felt very good on Welchol_ but that's because it wasn't doing anything.,F,54,6  months,3/11/2009Email,Welchol
33, 5, IBS & Post Gall bladder surgery,A slight tendency toward constipation_ but considering the prevalence of diarrhea previously_ I can live with it. After decades of suffering_ I count this a miracle drug.,,M,,2  years,2/13/2009,Welchol
34, 1, High cholesterol,Constipation_ gas_ ringing in ears,I was glad to see someone else above complained about ringing in the ears as a side effect of Welchol_ because that's what I experienced. Besides the constipation and bloating that are a noted side effect_ about 10 days after starting Welchol I started to get the ringing in my ears -- at random_ multiple times a day.  I finally stopped the Welchol due to the constant constipation and gas problems (just not worth the discomfort)_ and lo and behold the ringing in my ears stopped about a week later. Haven't had any ringing since (and never had any before)_ so I'm sure it was the Welchol. Just like statins_ too many side effects. Would not recommend.,M,52,4  months,9/14/2008,Welchol
35, 5, Gallbladder Removed,None.,Gallbladder was not functioning properly; thus_ it was removed.  It continuously leaked into my intestines causing irritation.  I used Welchol to bind excess bile and flush it out my system.   I used it for about 8 months after the removal of the gallbladder.  It worked great for me.,M,35,8  months,7/18/2008,Welchol
36, 2, high total cholesterol and high LDL,constipation_ gas and general GI discomfort; sore throat; and ringing in ears which started about one week after starting Welchol and continued until I stopped.,Had tried statins several years ago but had way too many serious side effects.  My cardiologist recently convinced me to try Welchol for three months_ but the GI distress plus the new ringing in my ears (which I never ever had before) forced me to stop after the three months.  Did reduce my LDL_ but only slightly.  Not worth the side effects.,M,60,3  months,6/22/2008,Welchol
37, 5, IBS-D,none,Stopped my IBS-D and the pain and cramps on day one. Only had three attacks in 6 months.  I can travel again and eat things I never have been able to in years. This has changed my enjoyment of life_ have suffered 30 years with this until Welchol.,M,55,9  months,5/20/2008,Welchol
38, 5, BILE SALT DIAHHREA - NO GALLBLADDER,NONE,I had my gallbladder out in 98.  They put me on Questran.  That was horrible - terrible constipation!  Then they put me on Welchol - still binds the excess bile in the digestive tract but no side effects.  Best of all no bile salt D and I can eat all the fat I want.  3 tablets after breakfast and dinner.  They are BIG pills_ but I don't care.  Gave me my life back.  I can however see how someone with a gallbladder could wind up with too little bile in their system from these pills and wind up with terrible side effects / that however was not my situation.  I had too much bile to start with.,F,42,5  years,2/9/2008Email,Welchol

43, 3, High Cholesterol,None that I am aware of.,Took in conjunction with Niaspan and Lipitor.  Niaspan and Welchol alone did not seem to reduce cholesterol significantly -only when Lipitor was added was significant reduction seen.  So I don't know to what extent Welchol is helping.,M,44,5  years,5/11/2006,Welchol
44, 5, Stomach Troubles,Ocasional muscle and joint aches.,My gall bladder was removed 3 years ago_ and 2 years ago i developed many problems because of it_ I could no long er eat meat_ because anything with fats in it would upset my stomach.
