0, 4, Orthostatic Hypotension,None,"I have severe low BP which cycles up and down during the day. W/O Midodrine I basically cannot function in society and am housebound. With the drug I can at least get through an 8 hr workday so I can make a living. I wish they had longer lasting Midodrine. The effectiveness of each 10 MG dose is about 4 - 5 hours. It takes about 45 minutes to ""kick in"" and when the effectiveness wears off_ it wears off very_ very quickly (minutes).",M,65,2  years10 MG 3X D,9/16/2010,Midodrine hydrochloride
