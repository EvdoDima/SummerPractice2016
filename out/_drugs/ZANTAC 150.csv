My ears hurt_ they are so plugged I can hardly hear_ I have mild sinus issues_ but mainly in my ears. I am constantly tired and feeling like I could fall asleep no matter where I am or what I am doing. I have also had a horrible migraine headache that won't go away. My Dr wants me to go in today for this. These night pitch ringing in my ears is also another thing that is driving me crazy. My brain functions don't seem what it normally is_ and all I want to do is curls in a ball and just sleep it all away_ but causes me to not be able to sleep at night and makes me want to sleep in the day.

17, 2, Acid reflux and ulcer,Zantac worked fine in the beginning and has helped somewhat.  My problem is that after taking it over a period of time I had diarrhea_ nausea and extreme dizziness.  I had to stop taking it as I could not go to work.  For me the side effects outweighed the benefits.

Within 2-3 hours of consuming the tablet_ I fell extremely ill - unbearable upper abdominal pain & cramping_ extreme nausea_ the worst case of diarrhea_ and dizziness.  Now_ after over 7 hours_ the abdominal pain has led to repeated  vomitting.  After reading the labelled side effects more closely_ I have discarded of the entire bottle to spare myself any further torment as I am 100% certain that the Zantac was the cause of my extreme symptoms.

28, 1, Prevent ulcers from other medicatio,Severe headache_ rapid heart beat_ tightness in throat_ acid reflux_ bloating_ gas_ loose stool_ jitters_ sweating_ insomnia,I started taking zantac along with a high dose of steroids for 10 days. I had just had a spinal tap done the day before. I ended up with what I assumed to be a spinal headache from the procedure. After calling doctors and a trip to the ER explaining my headache_ (which has lasted 10 days)_ I was told my symptoms were not those of a spinal headache. I couldn't move_ I stayed on the couch for days. Worse than any migrane I have ever had in my life. After coming to this website tonight and reading reviews_ I realize it most likely was the zantac. Yesterday I felt human again_ probably because  I forgot to take the zantac. I have also never once experienced acid reflux until I started taking this. I took zantac around 5pm today with my other pills. It is now 3am and I still cannot sleep. I am sweating_ my stomach is in pain _ and my headache is back. I absolutely will be throwing the remaining pills away today.,F,25,10  days,10/23/2015Email,Zantac 150

All of my symptoms started a few days after starting the zantac. The anxiety is horrible. I don't know what I'm going to do now. I guess I'll at least lower the dose of zantac for now.

32, 5, from severe acid reflux at night,I started taking 2 times a day and immediately had trouble falling asleep and felt anxious. I would be fidgeting in bed a lot. I stopped the morning dose and started only taking at night since that's when I had worse symptoms with my stomach and immediately within 2 days of lowering the anxiety stopped. The Zantac was still effective. After a few months I started taking the second dose again and I did not get anxious I guess because my body was used to it. Zantac has changed my life. I couldn't sleep laying down at all I had to completely sit up to sleep or the heart burn was violent. And the only thing that would instantly stop the stomach acid from coming up was pepto bismal which took almost 2 years of suffering to find that out. Zantac is amazing. Just take a lower dose if u get anxious it will go away,,F,32,1  years150 mg 2X,9/13/2015Email,Zantac 150

It was in the area  where my lower intestine is located which i found odd. Then came the anxiety  that i was terminally ill. Almost felt like i was getting depressed. Not eating properly and just feeling different. I even had rapid lost weight that friends have noticed.  I know myself and my body_ I just know something is wrong so i decided to look up the side affects of Zantac 150 and a light bulb went off. I know it is exactly what is making me sick. I must of read like 50 comments and all their symptoms are like 95% the same symptoms I have. I mean i didn't get any blood clots or my heart didn't start  acting up thank God!

52, 1, heartburn,Frequent diarrhea_ constipation_ TERRIBLE ANXIETY_ pain in upper left side_ shortness of breath_ and I'm hot basically all of the time. INSOMNIA.,I struggled with anxiety while in middle school which would lead to me having diarrhea_ fever and shortness of breath. I thought I had grown out of it and then started getting it really badly again when I started college about a month after starting zantac. I thought I was just getting anxiety again because of being in a new environment. It all made sense. But recently_ it started getting worse. Recently_ I started suffering from insomnia as well. So I sat here and started thinking about how long I had been having these issues_ and it all started when I started taking zantac. I didn't even realize it was the problem because of thinking it was just normal anxiety like I had years before. So I googled the side effects and sure enough every problem that I was having in life was on the list. I decided to not take it today and do more research and after looking at other people's stories I do not think I will be taking it again. I think I would rather suffer with heartburn than have this continue to ruin my life. Can't even leave the house without fear of getting sick.
