8, 1, Atrophy,Extreme Headache_ Nausea_ Toxic Feeling,Horrible Experience with the WORST toxic reaction of my 54 years of life_ after taking this twice. I had an extreme headache with nausea_ which are listed as 'side effects_' but does make them healthy reactions to this so-called medicine. What we are not being told here is that estradiol is a very strong estrogen - AND Carcinogenic. As are the various other chemicals included in this synthetic mix_ i.e: parabens etc.. In addition_ this is seriously big pharma controlled as there is no comparable generic medicine 'allowed' here in the US. ONE tube of this crap costs $240.00 US - ABSURD. The pharmacy I went to lad me that they used to make a comparable compound formula for $40.00_ but they are no longer 'allowed.' ??  Consider ESTRIOL! It's SAFE. Note that Drugs.com will not publish this review.,F,54,2  days1 gm 1X D,7/25/2015Email,Estrace
9, 1, Vaginal pain during intercourse.,This stuff worked great until I went to Doctor because I was bent over in  abdominal pain_ joint pain_ couldn't lift my right arm_ jaw pain and high blood pressure_ headaches and forgetfulness. Doctor wanted me to see specialist until I googled the symptoms of this cream and stopped taking it. Much better now_ but looking for a cream for vaginal pain that will work without all these issues:(,Don't take it,F,52,3  months1MG weekly,3/25/2015,Estrace
10, 2, vaginal dryness_ atrophy_ after men,Found that when I did the 1 gm vaginally_ I would get a dizzy sensation.  Using less helped.

11, 1, Vaginal dryness from menopause,Weight gain_ loss of appetite_ bloating and abdominal pain_ water retention_ dry eyes_ muscle and joint pain_ and nightmares.,My gyn recommended Estrace at my one year check up due to acute vaginal dryness and inflammation.  I used it on a Tuesday and then on Thursday.  By Saturday_ my abdomen was so swollen and sore that it felt like I had on a belt that was too tight.  I also had no appetite at all.  My rings were too tight and so were my pants.  I went to see my primary dr on Monday.  He said that the dose was too high and to just use a tiny bit topically once the side effects are gone.  A week after my first dose_ my eyes were so dry that they were throbbing.  I also have severe muscle and joint pain and can't turn my head without it really hurting my neck.  I have had pretty bad nightmares for the past three nights all having to do with babies.  Weird!  I am anxious for this stuff to get out of my system completely.  I guess no sex for me unless using it topically will work.,F,53,2  days2 mg 3X W,3/5/2014Email,Estrace

19, 2, To manage PP hormonal side effects,Fever_ chills_ headache_ nausea. I thought I had the flu_ but soon realized the symptoms would come and go_ always beginning about 16 hours after applying Estrace. After 4 doses the correlation was clear.

23, 4, menopause,None what so ever,I had a hysterctomy and ovaries removed 3 years ago and have tried everything for hot flashes. They were horrible and nothing worked.

24, 5, HRT/vaginal dryness,No negative side effects,If you are taking this for vaginal dryness in particular_ I would STRONGLY recommend checking into FemRing_ which is a flexible ring inserted vaginally every three months that delivers a measured dosage of estrogen.  FAR superior to the messy creams!  I would still be on FemRing if my Rx coverage had not stopped covering it.,F,54,3  months,12/18/2006,Estrace

I love it personally.,F,57,12  years,6/10/2002,Estrace
30, 5, hormone replacement therapy,none,This really helped smooth out the perimenopausal symptoms.  What a great alternative to those synthetic hormones (in birth control pills) that had unending side effects!,F,45,5  years,4/19/2002,Estrace
