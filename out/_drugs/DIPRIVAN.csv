0, 3, ,The drug itself worked wonderfully! But putting it through my IV was the absolute WORST HORRIFIC PAIN I HAVE EVER FELT! It felt as if they were putting fire in my arm! My arm felt like it was going to explode! I could tolerate pain I've had two kids and I'm a pretty quiet person... I told the doctor it's burning and it just kept getting worse I ended up screaming and crying begging them to stop! Finally the doctor went to the opposite arm and gave me another injection that did not hurt and put me out.. I have never experienced pain like that in my life.. I did hear the doctor say it was because it was a small vein... I have huge veins.. I'm always told when I take blood how wonderful my veins are this was shocking to hear.... Other then that I remember crying falling asleep and then remember waking up and just so happy it was all over... I'm definitely scared out of my mind to ever be put under for the reason of the burning sensation! It's been 5 days since surgery and I feel Iike I have a Charlie horse in my arm and numbness... And a black & blue nasty bruise..Pain from a 1-10  was 10+++++++,,F,36,1  days,7/13/2016,Diprivan

5, 1, Colonoscopy,Woke up crying and cried hysterically on and off for a day or two afterwards_ plus I was highly anxious and agitated. I was definitely not myself.,I took Diprivan because I woke up crying in pain during the last part of my first scope under the usual Fentanyl-Versed combo and the procedure could not be completed. Needless to say_ after having nothing but trouble both times_ I will never have another scope for screening purposes.,F,54,1  days,10/12/2015,Diprivan

7, 4, Colonoscopy,I was out within 5 seconds of the propofol being injected into the IV. Woke up in recovery extreme tired and zombie like. Slept the majority of the day afterwards_ felt so tired and drained. But now it's been 8 hours since I left the doctors office and I'm experiencing the worst join pain in every joint of both legs and arms.  I feel like I was either running a marathon all day or am getting the flu.

9, 5, Surgeries_ EGD and colonoscopy,None.,I've had 6 surgeries since 2010-an endometrial ablation_ bone spur removal on both feet which was 2 separate surgeries_ a 2 level ACDF on my cervical spine(major surgery) knee athroscopy for a torn meniscus and bilateral eye muscle surgery and I just recently had a colonoscopy and EGD during two visits to the endoscopy center in the last 2 months. I had propofol for all of those procedures-one minute you're awake_ the next thing  you know you're in recovery and thinking how easy it all went. Propofol is such a wonderful drug.  When I had my epidural steroid injections and my liver biopsy I had fentanyl and versed/ or just versed. I remember both procedures and even though I don't recall any pain I do remember the needle and biopsy needle. Unlike the propofol I have no clear memories of the rest of day for both procedures.,F,54,  1X D,9/3/2015,Diprivan

Prickly and itching all over body. Intense pin prick feelings. What is it doing to the rest of your body if it hurt so bad in the arm?,Why is this damaging poison being administered to us and why are we being told it is so great!??? It is not!

This left me with ulcers up my arms and shoulders that are still covering my left arm for 3 years now.,The doctor's both told me they give us enough dope when that happens and very few remember it.

19, 2, epidural injection in my lower back,An IV was placed (so I thought) was given propofol but never fell out. I was awake the whole time.

20, 5, EGD/ UPPER ENDOSCOPY,As soon as this was injected into my IV_ I could feel myself losing consciousness_in what seemed like slow motion. It probably only took 20 seconds for me to black out_ but I don't like the feeling of losing control. I have had many surgeries and have never experienced this panic with anesthesia. Next time_ I will tell the anesthesiologist to make sure I black out without warning. I don't remember the EGD and that's the important thing. I know I yelled out several times before it worked.,I was already anxious about this procedure_ so maybe I should have been given an anti-anxiety med beforehand. I don't like the feeling of losing control_ and that's how I felt suddenly after being injected. I was also trying to breathe through the bite block and that may have made the anxiety sensation worse. In fact_ every other surgery I've ever had_ the bite block was placed after I was unconscious. I was injected with Robinal beforehand and my mouth was dried out from it. I don't know if this may have had an effect or not.,F,38,1  timesunknown,2/11/2015,Diprivan

I have never had any side effects from any of the drugs given to me during these procedures except for the usual grogginess. But I do confess I tend to get nervous prior to been put out. This time I went in for and EGD. The anesthesiologist told me you should fall asleep in about 20 seconds and might feel a burning sensation on your arm. It felt like the longest 20 seconds in my life.  I closed my eyes and started paying. I did not feel any burning but I did feel when the drug went into my brain and remember thinking_ oh there is goes_ then I felt it again. This time it was a little bit stronger sensation than the first. I remember thinking ""again"". I do not recall anything else.  I had not in my life experienced anything like that before.

25, 5, Colonoscopy and Upper Endoscopy,I have Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and an overall phobia of all medications so was terrified at the thought of using Propofol but had to have a Colonoscopy due to an extremely high family history of Colon Caner and symptoms I was having.  After getting prepped for the procedure the assisting nurse had me lie on my side and told me to open my mouth to insert a guard for the Upper Endoscopy and that's the last thing I remember.  There was no time to panic.  While she had me distracted the Anesthetist injected the Propofol into my IV.  I had absolutely no problems with it and have no memory of anything regarding the procedure.  The next thing I recall is being escorted out to the car by my husband.  I think it's a wonderful_ fast acting anesthetic and would gladly use it again for any procedure.  The after effects were only that I was more groggy than I had expected for the remainder of the day and on the second day developed a runny nose and some mild sneezing.

Both my Dr and the anesthesiologist reacted_ my doctor walking quickly over and the anesthesiologist checking my IV.   I swore_ SWORE I heard someone say is she crashing?

It felt funny to drink water; eating a sandwich was very difficult. I was ok until about 14 hrs after the colonoscopy when I noticed my throat glands had swollen to the size of golf balls. Four days later the swelling has improved to small grapes. When I reported the swelling to the dr he implied it must be from something else.

I have had to take 1-2 doses of Excedrin  each day.  The pain is in the same spot each day. It's not terrible_ but I wondered if it was a common side effect.,I was told to lay on my side and that's the last thing I remember. No counting or getting sleepy. Apparently_ I did say something to the doctor as I was going under & I had no recollection. I was shocked when he told me I had told him to do a good job because I had tickets for an upcoming sporting event. I had only met him that day & we had not discussed anything other than the surgery. I was expecting to feel groggy or have a sore throat but I felt fine when I woke up. I felt a little buzzed when I walked a few feet into a bathroom but that went away.

I received this medication in the past and the only difference this time is a constant runny nose and sneezing.  After reading others comments it seems like it is a common side effect.

I think they wanted to rush the procedures to avoid gridlock in the exam room_ so they knocked me out more quickly with higher doses of the stuff. I feel like I have permanent brain damage.

45, 2, Colonoscopy,I experienced profuse sneezing and copious nasal mucous discharge beginning immediately upon exiting the hospital. I had to use tissue after tissue after tissue_ all of which tore causing mucous to run down my sleeve_ the front of my coat_ and the side of my handbag. Sneezing fits continued until I decided to put wet cotton balls into the left nostril (the side that I was lying on during the colonoscopy) that helped for twenty minutes at a time. Sneezing convulsions continued when the cotton was removed for 2-3 seconds. This went on for 3-4 days_ when I was able to downgrade to a dry tissue stuffed into my nose. Then_ the right nostril started to drip. That lasted for another 3 days. Then_ I could breath without any insertions_ but the sneezing continued every 3 - 5 minutes for the next five days and lessened to hourly. The coughing that was periodic in the beginning then became frequent to the point where my lungs became sore_ fell heavy_ full_ and irritated.

After being used as a human pin cushion the iv was administered and shortly after the propofol was introduced.  I went right out and came back to almost full consciousnesses in about 20 min.  The next day I awoke with a headache which I normally don't get that has lasted 4 days now.  On top of that I don't feel like my normal self and my brain doesn't seem to be functioning well in terms of memory and conversation. I've also been experiencing minor tinnitus and a feeling that I'm lacking oxygen.  I'm almost positive the propofol is the cause.  I called the endoscopy center to see if this was normal.

He put together a ""cocktail"" of fantyal(spelled wrong)_ versed and propofol. I asked him if I would feel the sharp pain in my arm as it was being administered. I asked him about being sleepy the rest of the day and the length of time in recovery. I did not experience any  pain as they slowly started sedating me as I was being wheeled to OR. There was no counting nor did he tell he was going to give me the cocktail. I rolled over on my side and just closed my eyes.

I feel tired because of lack of sleep from worrying about the surgery but it was absolutely great. I shouldnt have worried. The fact that we talked about what to expect helped a great deal. The doctors and staff at the St Vincent Hospital Surgery Center were also very warm_ caring and jok",,M,61,  1X D,9/19/2012Email,Diprivan
54, 5, colonoscopy,No side effects at all.   I was very nervous about having this procedure  because I had never been sedated before.  However_ it was no problem at all!  After the anesthesiologist  injected the medication_ I felt dizzy for a second and the next thing I knew my stretcher was being pushed into the recovery room.  I woke up that quickly.  I felt a little tired for about 10 minutes and within a half hour after that I was walking out the door of the surgi-center.  Do not be nervous like I was -  it's not needed.,,F,48,1  daysunknown 1X O,9/14/2012,Diprivan
55, 5, EGD twice and colonoscopy,This was an amazing drug. Peacfully nodded off to sleep and then awakened a bit groggy but ok. The key to success with this and any other medication is to be honest about all medications you are taking including supplements. Also_ make sure you are honest about your weight and health history because they dose based on all of those considerations.,,F,48,3  times,9/8/2012,Diprivan
56, 1, Given small dose for upper endoscop,I was given propofol three days ago for an upper endo. I am no stranger to the upper endo. I have also had a few surgeries including joint reconstruction for sports injuries. I am beyond upset. I just turned 37 on Monday. I am in shape_ eat raw foods_ and work out. My procedure was done around 2pm on Thursday. I slept pretty much until 11 pm that evening. I was told the next day I could go back to work. I am on no other meds except for my thyroid and prilosec.. Friday I drove to work in a fog. I should not have. The lines in the road were glowing. I felt sluggish and had to hold onto walls while walking. I forgot my usernames and passwords at work (which are my name). Coworkers said I appeared to be drunk (I drink ZERO alcohol). I left work and drove home right away_ except I lost my way home. I drive it every day. I had to pull over and plug in my gps. I have no memory of yesterday. Apparently I called people. I do not remember the conversations I had. And I yelled at people. I went i,never again,,37,1  daysunknown 1X D,9/8/2012Email,Diprivan
57, 5, Colonoscopy,I was so scared to be sedated_ and some of the things I read on the Internet terrified me even more- which is why I want to tell anyone that's nervous about propofol for this kind of procedure that everything went brilliantly smoothly.  I have panic disorder and was very frightened about what it might feel like_ but honestly it was just like when you fall asleep at night.  I woke when the procedure was over with no side effects or pain.  Don't let the Internet scare you_ it was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend it.  One thing I want to add is that it's nice to have an anesthesiologist administering it for further peace of mind_ but to anyone like me that's scared_ I hope this puts your mind at ease a bit.,,F,37,1  days,8/23/2012,Diprivan
58, 1, Endoscopy,So much burning! and my arm keeps on getting like a charlie horse.  & knot that hurts very much and my left side temple is throbbing a lot.,The drug does what it's set out to do I just wish that it didn't have to burn so much.,F,37,1  days 1X D,7/19/2012Email,Diprivan
59, 1, colonoscope,"3-4 minutes into colonoscope I had a ""respiratory event""-stopped breathing. They had to insert a tube through my nose into the trachea to help me breathe and get me stabilized. When I woke up in the recovery room I was throwing up and coughing up blood and my nose was bleeding. The doctor told me that he takes full responsibility for what happened_ and will find out why this happened. I still have a terrible cough 5 days later_ have been on antibiotics since the day of the ""event""_ had to go to the ER for the uncontrollable coughing_ and was put on steroids and an inhaler.",I will absolutely avoid this medicine in the future_ and ask more questions of the dr. and the person administrating any anesthesia. The dr. has called at least once a day_ very concerned about what happened. He has sent the remainder of the batch to the manufacturer for testing. I think it should have been sent to an independent laboratory. This has been a terrible experience_ and I am anxious to get answers.,F,47,  1X D,7/13/2012Email,Diprivan
