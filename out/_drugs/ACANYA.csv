0, 5, Clear acne caused by staph.,Mild flaking_ too much turned my skin pink (I learned that lesson the hard way). CLEARER SKIN!!!,Basically_ the drug is wonderful. I kept breaking out from a staph infection that wouldn't go away. When my skin finally healed_ my doc told me to apply this every morning (I do night instead)to prevent this from happening again and my skin looks much better. Even though it worked instantly for me_ I'd be patient and give it a few months.,F,21,2  months 1X D,11/30/2010,Acanya
