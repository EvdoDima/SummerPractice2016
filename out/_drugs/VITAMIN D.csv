3, 3, Vit D deficient due to MS,None,I cannot seem to get my levels above 19-25 range. Been on this for 2 years. Lowest I have been is 7. That is when I was very sick. They tell me that is also the source of this deep bone pain I have.. deep in the bones. My PCP just increased it yesterday to 4 times weekly. I pray it helps and I have good results.

5, 5, Feeling extremely run down,absolutely no side effect_ except I now feel one million times better. Highly recommended this vitamin,I was feeling extremely run down_ tired_ no energy_ depression etc and I had always been a get up and go type person with loads of energy and never depressed. My blood test showed my vitamin D level was almost non existant so I started on Vitamin D3. I took five 1_000 IU pills a day for the first 10 days then I took three pills a day for the next 2 months and now I take 1-2 pills every day. With in the first 4-5 days I felt alot better it felt as though the fog had lifted and I could see clearer. Over the next few months I am back to my old self I feel younger again with more energy and enthusiasum for life. I think my Vitamin D levels had gone down over a few years and I was putting my lack of energy and haziness down to getting older but when I began to feel really run down I went to my doctor for some answers. I had every blood test known to man and the only thing that came back as odd or low was the Vit D. Its amazing what the lack of this one vitamin can do to your life. I also now go outside alot more like I did when I was younger and get the original source of Vitamin D from the sun as much as possible.,F,42,7  months,12/2/2009,Vitamin d
