0, 1, Nasal polyps and chronic sinnisitis,I started noticing a foggy head feeling_ anxiety symptoms with tachycardia_ and fatigue!! Never thought a nasal spray which is supposed to act locally can cause all of this. And Everytime I told my ENT doc about these symptoms he would say it wouldn't cause it._ he says it probably psychological. I just stopped it today when I read some of the comments and I'm going to go with my gut feeling. How long before I begin to see some relief of the side effects? Please reply to me,,F,30,1  months2puffs BD,1/16/2016Email,Omnaris
1, 5, sinus headaches,rebound headaches if you stop taking it,I tried other steroid nasal sprays_ Omnaris is superior to all of them.  They all just ended up down my throat and caused burning.  Omnaris is amazing_ it stays right where it should be_ it stops my headaches_ and never any sore throat.  The manufacturer and the company with the patent got into a spat and stopped making it for a few months.  That sucked!  Shame on them for their games.,M,35,5  years2spray 1X D,1/7/2015,Omnaris
2, 1, Sinus Infection,Ringing and incredible pressure in my ears_ spike upward in blood pressure from 118/75 to 168/102. Severe anxiety and feeling totally detached from reality_ nausea and total fatigue. Bad med!! Going back to saline nasal spray and nasal irrigation to clean my sinuses. This holistic approach to allergy patients is proven. This stuff is poison and physicians should warn their patients about the side effects.,Cannot believe this along with other nasal steroids were approved by the FDA.,M,65,21  days 2X D,1/19/2014,Omnaris
3, 2, Seasonal Allergies,Extreme fatigue. Felt like I haven't slept at all. I'm also kind of anxious. I won't take it again. It seems that all of these types of steroid nasal sprays have the same symptoms.,,M,65,7  days 1X D,11/20/2013Email,Omnaris
4, 1, nasal inflamation/rhinitis,Extreme fatigue!! Almost considered going to the ER. Also behavioral side effects as well. Will never use this medication again. Felt far worse than before I started using it.,,F,51,4  days 1X D,9/8/2013,Omnaris
5, 1, severe congestion,agressionoverly emotional reactions inconsolability,My son is 6 and has a history of sensitivity to steroids. He already takes a Qvar inhaler daily but we've been trying a few nasal sprays to see if they could help his constant congestion (his adenoids are very enlarged) but first nasacort and now this have caused horrible behavioral side effects. He is weepy all the time_ super hard to transistion from one activity to the next without melting to the floor in a tearful tantrum and aggressive behavior that is super unlike my usually sweet boy.,M,6,8  days 1X D,4/3/2013,Omnaris
6, 1, Allergic Rhinitis,On the 2nd morning my eyes were puffy and almost swollen shut.  Same thing every morning after taking this spray,,F,42,5  days2 sprays 1X D,7/17/2012,Omnaris
7, 3, Nasal Allergies,I really had no noticeable side effects_ it just didn't work as well as Astelin (an antihistamine).,This nasal spray is good if you have to be off of antihistamines for a week or so in order to get allergy skin testing.  Other than that_ I prefer a nasal antihistamine like Astelin.  It works better for my nasal allergies than Omnaris.,M,49,4  years2 sp 1 X D 1X D,10/25/2011,Omnaris
8, 5, allergic rhinitis,no side effects,I have used 3 or 4 prescription sprays over the years. All caused sores in my nose_ some caused me to be jittery and hyper_ some caused insomnia. Symptoms improved with Omnaris but unfortunately after one prescription my insurance company will no longer pay for Omnaris because it is more expensive than the ones that have a generic equivalent.,M,66,30  days50 mcg 1X D,1/24/2011,Omnaris
9, 2, Allergies,Severe Congestion and Nasal Polyps.,At first it started to work well_ then i felt like it wasn't. Then I started getting nosebleeds and a really sore throat.  At around the fifth month_ I decided to try to get back on it_ upon the recommendation from my Allergies--but my congestion failed to improve--I kind of feel it got worse_ but its really hard to be sure.  Either way Omnaris wasn't helping.,M,29,6  months 1X D,8/23/2010,Omnaris
