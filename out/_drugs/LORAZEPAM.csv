2, 1, anxiety take as needed,I took a .025 half a .05 to make sure I was not allergic to it. I asked the phyco Dr. For a diazepam as I had taken 1 for dentist and one at ER and felt normal. She said no I have to take this. I tried half and was anxious and fresked out to tske it. I took it and with in 3 minutes it hit me. I felt head high and body pains intensified. Felt like it was harder to breath for 27 minutes I felt the worse intense Anxiety. It amplified my anxiety.  After 30 minutes I felt better but my legs were tired. So after 2 hours I took the other half and was not as bad but still had my anxiety. So On Friday June 24 2016 I was extremely anxious I thought ok this is the real run threw I knew I would not die from it so I took. 1/4 th of the .05 and with in 3 minutes i felt the head weired body harder tight chest amplified anxiety the worst. Then haveing to put my daugter back to bed and her being fussy was amplified my nerves were threw the roof. It was about 30 minutes before I felt ok so I decided to take the other 1/4 of the .05 and the same symtoms all over again. I am not making it up it is not in my head. I hate this stuff. All I wanted was take as needed Diazapam(valium) now The Dr. Will give my another different one to try next. The reason I have to take as needed is I have stroke type migraimnes and Tacacrdia for my heart so I can not really take anything.,I was prescribed 5 take as needed so I will try again and I am documenting for the Doctor my symptoms. I have researched that lorazepam increases the glutemate in the brain. Well I get migraines and read Glutemate from msg form and natural as well as potassium ion can cause the cortex depression the makes the visual disturbance of the migraine. But to say i have npt been triggered to have a migraine. I really do hate this stuff.,F,35,2  days.025 half,6/25/2016Email,Lorazepam

17, 1, Loss my child Still born full term,I was about to deliver my baby and her heart stop beating inside of me. They administered ATIVAN on top of narcotics to me to keep me numb. I never asked for them to treat me with ATIVAN and didn't even know what is was until I was released home  from the hospital and had been on the prescription for 30 days. I tried to cold turkey the ATIVAN and what did I do that for I had had my first panic attack. I was at work and it felt as if death was coming upon me and I couldn't stop it. I was pacing the floor and told people to please call 911 I was dying. The ambulance came and said I was having a panic attack. I was crying and didn't understand a damn thing at that point. They administered at the ER this damn ATIVAN again and it dawned on me to start my investigation on this actual drug and to start being mindful at the aftermath effects it had on me. ATIVAN is a quick fix when you are in a state of uncontrolled anxiety or a panic attack but beware because it amplifies your condition when you try to get off of it. I had weened myself off of it and gone through and still going through the motions of being off ATIVAN. I had major withdrawal symptoms like head aches_ muscle spasms_ dizziness_ feeling of doom randomly_ disoriented at times_ unable to concentrate at times_ nervousness_ upset stomach_ chest pains_ and the ultimate heart palpitations unbearably. I have been off for 5 months and still don't feel all the way like my old self. I even have to go to the dermatologist becaus,This is not a drug that should be given for more than a couple of days. The body should not be subject to it's negative feelings of heart attack and doom taking over. I mean it.,F,,2  days10,1/6/2016,Lorazepam

19, 1, Panic attacks  anxiety,Ringing in the ears . Dry mouth _ shortness of breath  . Tremors _ headache _ depressed  anxiety _ panic _,I was given lorazepam in the emergency room for insomnia due to anxiety and panic . My doctor told me that my thyroid jump from hypo to hyper and I was having a bad reaction to my thyroid meds. He told me to take 1mg three times a day for 6 weeks until the thyroid medicine cleared out of my system . He did not inform me that this drug is very addicting  . I started taking 1mg every 12 hours . This worked for awhile but then I noticed I would become very jumpy and aggravated afte taking the dose . Doctor told me that this drug has an 8 hour life in your system . So pretty much waiting 12 hours I was withdrawling  in between doses . So changed to .5mg every 6 hours . That worked for about a day . I felt like crap . Over medicated and I was having the strangest thoughts running through my head . Went to every 7 hours for about a day . Then went to every 8 hours . I've been doing every 8 hours for about 4 days now . My body starts to crave it an hour before the time and now it doesn't even work . Sometime I feel worse . Jitters anxious on the verge of panic . I feel very stuck and very angry . How can I be going through withdrawl if it is in my system 24/7 ? I hate this drug and everytime I take a dose I feel like it takes my life from me . So afraid I will not get off it and worried about how I will feel when I am off of it . I don't recommend this to anyone and I will never take it again !! What a joke they give me one drug to counter react another .,F,51,2  months.5 mg,4/27/2015,Lorazepam

40, 1, Insomnia,I was prescribed this because I was having trouble sleeping around age 41.  Many other meds were tried and my dr finally put me on this. Gradually I had to increase the dosage and got up to 1 mg a day.  This went on for years. I realized the side effect were so bad but I could not get off of it. I tried and tried but would get so sick and could not sleep.  Finally I was going to church and got baptized by emersion.   I decided to try again for the umpteenth time.  I had scary nightmares which were demonic!  I could not sleep and only slept about 3 hours a night for a year!!  It has been around 18 months now and I am doing so much better.  I actually sleep between 5-6 hours a night   I still have side effects. When I came off it I thought I would die of a heart attack.  PLEASE PLEASE don't take this drug unless its only for a VERY short time. Definitely not over 3 days. THE WITHDRAWALS are so so brutal.

44, 5, Anxiety  & sleep,I have taken lorazepam for a while. I take 1mg at bedtime & have had no problems at all. If you take as your psych Dr prescribed you will have no issues. It's important to skip nights to keep from building a tolerance. Taken correctly it will  make your life easier to cope these days. Problems start when one sways away from prescribed amount & schedule. If you take it responsibly you should have no problems. I know people who take 6-8mg a day. That's asking for trouble. It's great for anxiety used correctly. If you have allergic reaction it's not the medication going bad_ it's your body not accepting it so can't really rate it bad. Good luck & calm wishes...,,F,60,4  years1 mg,5/30/2013,Lorazepam

While initially it was great but I decided to get off the drug because i was getting better and my life was improving........I tried to stop it in a week slowly however I got horrible insomnia and was scared i would die. I was so scared i started taking it again and thank god i got my sleep back however_ I am STUCK. If i try to stop it i get side effects and I cant deal with the insomnia. I am going to try to half the dose for a month however i am also scared that even halfing the dose will kickstart the insomnia. So I wonder if i have to take this drug for the rest of my life_ its a pretty scary thought because it makes me feel that I will fall down...dont know if that is a feeling or a real tendency...whatever it is_ I am damned if i stop it and damned if I dont. DONT TAKE THIS DRUG.....its better to suffer naturally..... the side effects are worst!.....I will try to reduce to 0.5mgs a day and I pray that my body can handle it and dont get insomnia.,M,37,12  months1.2mg 2X D,9/24/2012Email,Lorazepam
