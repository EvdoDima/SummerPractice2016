2, 5, Bone and Joint pain from Lupus,,I was prescribed Zipsor for bone and joint pain associated with Lupus. I also have 3 herniated discs that have been bothering me for years_ and for which I have always taken a low dose of Vicodin (almost daily). The Zipsor works well on the Lupus pain_ but also almost completely wiped out the pain from the herniated discs_ and has replaced my usual narcotic pain relief for my back.  As with any disc issues there seems to be the occasional flare up_ but when they do occur now they are minor_ and once I take my usual dose of Zipsor_ the pain is gone again. I have had no recognizable side effects.,F,46,9  months25mg 3X D,9/10/2012,Zipsor
