0, 1, Flush central line placed for chemo,Developed hydrocephalus_ had to have third ventriculostomy & may need shunt. This is in my 20 month old daughter. There was an obvious link to the heparin flush. Started out falling asleep after flushes_ then vomited after each flush. By the time we connected it and stopped using it_ the fluid build up on her brain was too great for her body to deal with. She was on NO other meds (not even tylenol) at the time and had not yet received any chemo or radiation.,I advise against the flippant use of it. It should not be a part of standard care.,F,1,5  days8-10 mL 3X D,3/6/2014Email,Heparin lock flush
