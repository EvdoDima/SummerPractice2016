0, 1, Birth control,Pain at injection site_ mania_ hysteria_ crying_ depression. Onset of these symptoms were about 24 hours after the shot. My poor husband thought I'd gone nuts. For about 4 weeks_ I was a mess! I filed a report with the FDA_ and I think this drug has finally been taken off the market. I have used birth control pills for years_ with no problems_ but tried this one time at the recommendation of my doctor. YUCK! Never again!,One dose lasts approximately 4 weeks.,M,41,4  weeks,4/10/2008,Lunelle
1, 4, not good with pills,soreness at injection site_ some acne,I had a good experience with lunelle_ but they recalled it due to so many women having circulatory problems because of the drug.  I suppose a recall is a good reason not to take something! I didn't have any troubles with it personally.,F,22,1  years,9/22/2007Email,Lunelle
2, 1, birth control,weight gain,i heard this one got a recall on it because women were getting pregnant! glad i wasn't one,F,24,5  months,5/28/2007,Lunelle
3, 2, birth control_ control heavy period,A lot of breakthrough bleeding_ It was like constantly having a period. Going to the Dr. once a month to get a shot was a pain.,This did not work for me but every woman's body is different.,F,25,3  months,3/21/2007,Lunelle
