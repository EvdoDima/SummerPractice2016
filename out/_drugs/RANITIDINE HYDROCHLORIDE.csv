0, 5, Silent GERD,None.,"I have ""silent GERD""_ which means no heartburn; symptoms include esophageal spasms and nausea. It flares up into tiny ulcers from time to time. Zantac or Ranitidine controls this and heals the ulcers. BUT if you have any bone loss due to menopause or your body type you must not take this or the PPIs long-term. They block calcium absorption. This is less efficient than PPIs so it is a better choice. So I take it as needed. Really surprised to read about all the side-effects as I am hypersensitive to most medications.",F,62,5  years75-150 mg 1X D,8/12/2014,Ranitidine hydrochloride
