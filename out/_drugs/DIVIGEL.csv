0, 2, Low Estrogen Level in Perimenopause,Weight Gain_ Breasts Swollen & Tender_ Heavier Periods,I had some symptoms of low estrogen which were confirmed by a blood test. Helped me sleep better (used with bioidentical progesterone for 14 days out of the month) but it caused weight gain (even though I exercised and ate clean). My breasts always felt swollen and tender and my bras didn't fit. I actually stopped taking it cold turkey and my breasts returned to a more normal state and I am fitting into pants I couldn't before. The problem now is I am experiencing acne breakouts since going off it. Be very careful and do your research before going on these hormones whether they are bioidentical or not. They are powerful!,F,45,2  years.50mg 1X D,11/6/2013,Divigel
1, 5, Low Estrogen Level; Perimenopause,None,I am perimenopausal. Had blood levels tested for all hormones and estrogen level was very low. Adding a small dosage of Divigel really helps. Very easy to apply on a daily basis and the packet is convenient to travel with. Gel is absorbed immediately. I take in conjunction with other bioidentical hormones and have my hormone levels monitored on a yearly basis.,F,44,1  years.25mg 1X D,4/26/2013,Divigel
2, 4, Terrible migraines,I played around with different strengths and settled for 1mg and the dose is split in two doe the day am and pm.  I am very sensitive to estrogen and this bring my level up gradually.  I had intense migraines at 51_ which came out of the blue and this all has eliminat them including hot flashes.  The gel dries quickly and you can titration up or down if you exercise_ etc.  I tried to lower the dose since I thought it was giving me gallbladder issue and my vagina is raw and inflamed.  I have titrated back up_ so hopefully that will work.  NOTE exercise a lot and not sure if I am metabolizing more o the gel_ so I may need something local (estrace_ vagidem) in addition to the Divigel.  Anyone have experience with local bio identical estrogen?,I like the portability and ease of the Gel.,F,55,4  years1mg 1X D,4/21/2012Email,Divigel
