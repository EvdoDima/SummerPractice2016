0, 1, Sinus Infection,extreme fatigue_ indigestion_ loss of appetite_ nausea_ vomiting_ fogginess_ depression,"Started taking this to get rid of a persistent sinus infection that had failed to respond to another anti-biotic and persisted for months. I've never had a negative reaction to any anti-biotic or any other drug for that matter. It knocked the infection out in a few days_ but by the 6th day I started experiencing all the above effects. Probably should have stopped taking it then_ but it took me a while to trace what I was feeling to the drug. Took last dose 48 hours ago_ and still feel terrible. Finally puked for the first time since I've had nausea for days and feel a little better. I lost 5 pounds in less than a week. Probably should have gone to the emergency room or hospital at several points. Don't know how I worked 3 days this week. The ""cure"" in this case was much worse than the ailment.",M,41,10  days125 MG 2X D,5/26/2012Email,Augmentin '125'
1, 1, sinus infection,headache_ dizziness_ diarrhea,I started taking this for a week and I was fine and had no symptoms until a few days ago when I started feeling dizzy and I had a headache. I called the dr and she said to stop the  medication. I've never had any problem before with any other antibiotic. This is the first. Would not recommend.,F,31,7  days125 2X D,3/22/2011,Augmentin '125'
2, 2, Auxillary Gland Infection/Abscess,Diarrhea_ nausea and red_ itchy rash,Doctor prescribed this to me to prevent the spread of an infection in my arm. For that reason_ it worked wonderfully. After the abscess was drained my doctor said the wound looked great and the redness from the infection ceased in my arm. But I had diarrhea halfway through the second day and it lasted through the end of the treatment period despite trying to take probiotics to help it. Then on the eighth day I broke out into a rash_ very similar to hives_ all over my body. My doctor suggested benadryl to alleviate the itching. This medicine did what it was supposed to do; it just came with side effects that made me feel worse than I already did.,F,20,10  days125 3X D,3/7/2011,Augmentin '125'
3, 1, Mild infection in cyst on ear,Intense nausea followed by hours of vomiting/dry heaving with nausea for almost 24 hours.,I was given this antibiotic for a small cyst that popped up on my ear that looked like it could be slightly infected.  I took one pill with a large meal and two hours later I was INTENSELY nauseous.  Then I proceeded to vomit on and off for hours and eventually it was just dry heaving.  I was nauseous for about 24 hours.  Won't be taking this again.  I had not needed to take an antibiotic in about 10 years_ but I have never had a reaction like this to one.  My doctor told me to stop taking it and just apply an antibiotic ointment.,F,38,1  days125 2X D,8/26/2010,Augmentin '125'
