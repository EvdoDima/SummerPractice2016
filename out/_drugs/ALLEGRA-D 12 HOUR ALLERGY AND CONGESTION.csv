2, 2, Allergies,Shortness of breath_ extreme loss of appetite_ depression_ anxiety_ heart palpitations_ tired yet restless,I started taking this pill and it seemed great I couldn't find anything to work for my allergies except this. I have been taking this pill for about a year and eight months. In that time I have lost 20 pounds because of loss of appetite which was not needed. The side affects seem to get worse I have extremely dry mouth as well. I was at work the other day where I am always on my feet and had to sit down because I could not catch my breath and my chest was tight. I am a relatively fit person I run and bike often and have only felt theses symptoms after taking this pill. I thought suffering from depression was a normal part of life but when I don't take my pill for a few days I feel so much better. I've been restless almost every night although I take my pill at 6am and go to bed at 10-11pm. Please do not take this pill find something like a natural/holistic remedy or approach to your allergie problems.,F,17,2  years12 hour,1/4/2016,Allegra-d 12 hour allergy and congestion
