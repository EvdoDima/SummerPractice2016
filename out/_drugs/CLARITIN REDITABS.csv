0, 5, Hives,None! I love Claritin! I get hives when I have a fever or if I am warm (in Texas that's a lot). I have tried ALL allergy drugs and nothing worked as well as Claritin. I take it as needed_ like if I will be at the beach or even when I am bundled up in the winter. Takes care of the hives in about an hour. Only side effect I have ever noticed is hangovers are little worse.  But that's behind me. ;),Love it.,F,42,5  years10mg 1X AN,10/7/2013,Claritin reditabs

6, 1, seasonal allergies,"ears stuffed; ""out of it"" feeling; tired; alternating sweating/chills",Have only taken two days:  yesterday @ 2pm and today @ 11am.  After reading on this site_ I am already sorry I took today's dose and hour and a half ago as my ears feel stuffed almost shut and I feel zombie like.  NOT good for anyone having to drive or work a demanding job.  I'm drinking a lot of water hoping to get this out of my system sooner.  Of note_ I take NO OTHER meds_ and haven't for years_ I exercise daily in a gym and usually feel very healthy.  Sorry I started this drug and won't continue.,F,59,2  days,7/1/2009,Claritin reditabs
7, 2, Seasonal Allergies,Cannot sleep despite being exhausted all day. Easily aggrivated_ and find it difficult to concentrate.,The first day_ it hardly worked at all. After the first day my allergies seemed to be almost completely gone. I'm not sure what I'd rather deal with_ my horrible allergies_ constant sneezing_ runny nose and watery eyes or the side effects of the drug. Either way I cannot get any work done and am miserable.,M,23,4  days,6/3/2009,Claritin reditabs

For the last few years_ I've had no trouble at all.  This season_ though_ it just hasn't been helping that much.  With the side-effects keeping me up at night_ I'm taking benadryl to sleep!  I think I'll just stick with that and keep on being tired during the day.  I was ready to blame my bc for the anxiety and hot flashes before reading these!,F,25,4  years,3/18/2009,Claritin reditabs

14, 1, Allergies/drainage,My son had hyperactivity_ extremely aggressive behavior_ sleeping problems.,"My pediatrician recommended this medicine for my 3 year old son.  The doctor didn't seem to have a problem giving my son the 10mg dose but children his age shouldn't take an adult dose.  My son had a terrible experience with this.  He threw things at us_ hit_ kicked and slapped us.  He was Dr. Jeckyl_ Mr. Hyde with this crap.  Would never give to a child again.  We were at the point we were going to get him ""evaluated"" when we realized that the Claritin was the problem.  Thank God we did_ he's a different child now.",M,3,10  days,7/19/2006,Claritin reditabs
