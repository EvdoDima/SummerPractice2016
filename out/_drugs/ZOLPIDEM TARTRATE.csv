0, 1, insomnia,"Symptoms: horrendous spikes in anxiety_ terrible night itches_ burning gums and tongue (trigeminal neuralgia spiked)_ increased sinus congestion_ pounding heart_ jitteriness_ waking up feeling ""wired"" --  in other words_ I was having an allergic reaction_ which occurred when my pharmacy switched me to an oblong peach generic zolpidem.  When I finally pinpointed the peach zolpidem_ and switched to brand Ambien_ the symptoms receded within three days_ and now_ a week later I'm getting back on keel with anxiety way down_ no itches_ sinuses clearing_ neuralgia calmer.  Thank heavens.  I had thought the problem was with other drugs prescribed for me to counteract the symptoms I was experiencing -- drugs for anxiety_ neuralgia_ sinus congestion -- so I quit them_ which lessened my symptoms_ but it wasn't until I got off the peach pills completely that my symptoms began to disappear.",Do not take the peach generic.  It's awful!,F,73,4  weeks10-15mg 1X D,3/14/2015,Zolpidem tartrate
1, 3, insomnia,brain fog; back pain; itching,My insurance company forced me to get the generic of Ambien_ manufactured by Teva.  I don't believe it is as effective as the name brand.  It did put me to sleep for ~5 hours in a row the 2 nights that I took it.  On the second night_ I took it in the 6 p.m. hour & slept until ~11:30 p.m.  I then stayed awake until ~2 a.m._ when I took another 5 mg.  That only put me to sleep for 3 hours.  After a period of clarity in the early morning_ I felt spacy_ anxious_ emotional & had aches & pains most of the day.  It feels like my left eye is seeing from a different depth than my right eye_ as though I am about to get a migraine.,F,45,2  days5 mg 1X D,6/27/2010Email,Zolpidem tartrate
