0, 5, Birth Control/Hormone Regulation,I've been on Kariva for nearly two years and never experenced any noticeable side effects on this medication. My hormones were out of whack beforehand_ and I have since been tested_ and they are all within normal levels now. Even in the beginning_ I didn't have any period of emotional side effects_ weight gain_ those kind of symptoms that typically accompany a new birth control pill.,,F,27,2  years 1X D,7/5/2015Email,Kariva

2, 2, Birth Control,Constant migraines_ dizziness_ weight gain_ pain/swelling in legs/feet_ eye pain_ depression_ extremely low sex drive_ still have the same amount of breakouts_ every month my period is 5-10 days later than the last start date,I really don't see anything good about this birth control. It's supposed to be another way to prevent pregnancy but you really don't need that when you have no drive whatsoever to have sex. Does the good out weigh the bad for me? No_ in fact_ I'm going to talk to my doctor about getting on a different birth control. I've had nothing but medical problems since I started taking it.,F,30,1  years0.15 1X D,8/27/2014Email,Kariva
3, 3, Regulated period and worry free sex,This is the only bc I have ever taken and over the years has made my period so light and regular I always know when I'm getting it and it now is reduced to 3 1/2 days (a lot of which is light- and very minimal cramping- no acne or other side effects mentioned)-- which makes me never want to come off of it. HOWEVER- it has completely killed my sex drive! I want to WANT to have sex but I am never turned on what so ever- not by my boyfriend or any other male I see for that matter. Its my only complaint but it sucks when the main reason you are on it is so you can have sex freely but now you don't even want to anymore,,F,22,5  years,1/31/2014Email,Kariva
4, 5, ,Kariva cleared up my face better than any other birth control I have ever tried. Never before have I consistently had zero zits!,,F,25,4  years 1X D,3/7/2013,Kariva
5, 4, Horomone Regulation,Weight gain(20 pounds)_ loss of sex drive,I started taking Kariva to regulate my horomones. Im not on Kariva now_ but I was. It did exactly what I needed it to_ without making me very moody. I did gain a decent amount of weight_ but I could deal with that. The only sucky thing about this birth control is I had no interest in sex_ and when I had sex I didnt feel much of anything. Its okay though_ they make pills for that.,F,24,1  years 1X D,8/5/2012Email,Kariva
6, 3, Birth Control,horrible acne_ mood swings,Kariva did help lighten my periods and I rarely experienced cramps or breast tenderness_ but my ance became horrible.  The sides of my face have broken out with terrible cystic acne and it has also shown up on my chest and back.  This is not worth it to me and I started Ortho Tri-cyclen this morning.  Hoping it works a lot better to clear up this acne.,F,24,3  months 1X D,6/22/2012Email,Kariva
7, 3, Birth Control,The only side effect that i have really noticed_ like others have said is absolutely no interest in sex at all.,,F,22,2.5  years 1X D,4/29/2012Email,Kariva
8, 3, birth control,Lowered sex drive.... But my period comes regularly for about 5 days. Less cramping_ and this brand doesn't cost much.,Very low sex drive.,F,25,4  months 1X D,10/30/2011Email,Kariva
9, 1, birth control,Moodiness_ tearfullness_ yeast infections_ decreased sex drive,,F,32,1.5  years 1X D,9/12/2010,Kariva
10, 3, Contraceptive,Extremely low libido ..which is continuing to get worse_ headaches_ mild cramps and bad cystic-like acne in the beginning.,Excellent for my menstrual cycle; it lowered my periods down to approx. 3 days_ very little cramping_ no heavy bleeding. I also didn't experience any weight gain or loss. No moodiness that I'm aware of. Plan to get off this pill ASAP because I have absolutely no interest in sex and it's making my relationship suffer.,F,21,2  years 1X D,8/31/2010,Kariva
