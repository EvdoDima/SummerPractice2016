6, 2, high trigs,fatigue_ depression_ irritability_ trouble sleeping_ HIGHER trigs than before taking the meds!,Doctor put me on gemfibrozil to lower my Triglycerides and raise my HDLs_ however after 5 months on the drug_ my Triglycerides are now almost double what they were before and my HDLs have not increased.

7, 5, Very high TGs (several thousand),None that I can attribute directly to lopid. I do get some foot cramps (but I am type II diabetic) and I can control them by keeping feet warm and eating bananas. I did have two frozen shoulders_ but I am taking many oral meds so who knows what caused them.,I'm satisfied. My TG went down from 2300? to 215. While I do find sites like this useful_ bear in mind that it's generally the people who have problems who post. I found this site as I wanted to see if anyone had advice about controlling TG *and* HDL/LDL (which usually means a statin) and lopid_ which is a *dangerous* combination.,M,51,15  years,11/3/2009,Lopid
8, 1, Cholesterol total was 231,Muscle aches in arms and back_ blurred vision,Had taken Lipitor years ago and had to stop due to muscle pains.  Two months after starting Lopid_ I have muscle pains mostly in my arms_ shoulders and back_ but the blurred vision scared me  due to previous surgery in that eye.  My eye doctor found nothing wrong and thought it could possibly be a sinus infection. (but I didn't have the usual sinus infection symptoms).   Unsure if antibiotic worked_ as took full length of 10 days before blurred vision stopped_ but now it returns off and on and only in one eye.   I'm going to stop Lopid for a while and then try again_ and if same problems occur_ I'll know it's the Lopid.  My total cholesterol was 231 (HDL 44 and LDL 154).,F,69,2  months,7/13/2009,Lopid
9, 4, High tri's,Some heartburn and appear to be more tired than usual.,I am taking one 600mg tablet a day.  Also 3 fish oils per day.  I have an underactive thyroid and take meds for that as well. This medication in conjuction w/ fish oil ( which i took alone for 3 months and lowered tri's from 992 to 512 ) has now lowered my tri's to around 200.  I think continuing with fish oil and lopid and continuing to exercise and lose some weight will get me where I need to be.,F,45,6  months,5/27/2009,Lopid
10, 1, High triglycerides,Wild_ vivid dreams and joint pain,I couldn't figure out why I was suddenly having wild_ vivid dreams so I tried to figure out what was different.  I had started taking Lopid three days earlier.  I stopped the med and the dreams stopped.  I waited two weeks and started taking Lopid again and after two days the dreams are back_ so the med is going away forever.  I am exhausted every morning from the dreams.,F,52,3  days,7/16/2008,Lopid

My reaction onset quickly (within 3 days)_ and after quitting gemfibrozil/Lopid_ I started feeling better within days. I was re-prescribed Tricor_ which is in the same class as Lopid. I had similar effects with it. So this family of drugs didn't work for me. I was given 1200mg (2x 600mg tabs) Lopid per day. I was only taking over the counter Claritin for allergies while on Lopid.,M,27,9  days,6/23/2008,Lopid

18, 1, High triglycerides,Headache_ cramps in my feet and muscle aches in my legs.,I was told this would not harm me like Lipitor did since I was no longer taking a statin drug.  It seems to be once you have taken a statin and experienced damage from that other meds will do the same thing to our bodies.,F,49,7  days,8/31/2006Email,Lopid
