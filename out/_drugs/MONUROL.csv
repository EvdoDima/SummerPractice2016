0, 5, UTI,I am absolutely way too sensitive to nearly ALL antibiotics that treat UTI's; I cannot take Flagyl_ Cipro_ Bactrim_ or Macrobid.  My doctor gave me this medication as a last ditched effort; it worked!,No side effects at all!  This med is old school_ and insurance does not cover it.  It was $65 and is found at compounding pharmacies_ or old school pharmacies.  Walgreens does not carry it.,F,41,1  times1 packet 1X D,6/13/2010Email,Monurol
1, 1, UTI,,NO PHARMACIES HAD THIS MEDICATION AVAILABLE. WALGREENS_ RITE AID_ ETC... IT IS HARD TO FIND AND WAY EXPENSIVE. NO INSURANCE COMPANIES CARRY IT. THIS ISN'T A GOOD ALTERNATIVE IF YOU NEED IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND HELP WITH YOUR INFECTION.,F,22,0  days,1/21/2006,Monurol
