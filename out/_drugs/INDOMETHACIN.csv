3, 5, Gout,No side effects whatsoever. Even took it on an  empty stomach.,I finally figured out I have Gout_ the P.A. prescribed Indomethacin. This basically cured my gout in my foot in like 3 days. I feel like this medicine is a godsend! In the past w/o any pain meds I would be bedridden due to foot pain for like 2 weeks before I could walk again.

12, 5, Originally for Knee surgery in 1995,I have had no side effects whatsoever. Just lucky_ I guess,I originally began taking Indo after a big time knee surgery in 1995 since over-the-counter drugs were not helping with pain management during recovery. I have been playing baseball(hardball) since that surgery almost every weekend_ sometimes two games and Indo really helps with any minor pain that I would experience. This year my left hip went kablooey_ and will require replacement_ but will not be scheduled for a few months. I am continuing to play but could not with the hip pain unless I took my Indo the night before. For me_ it is indispensable! I'm sure that I will need it during my hip replacement recovery.,M,65,20  years50 MG x 2 1X AN,8/5/2015,Indomethacin
13, 2, Extreme pain due to infected tooth,Sick stomach_ dizziness_ mild confusion_ needing to use washroom more,I wouldn't recommend using this drug_ I've used very strong pain killers before (such as codeine_ morphine_ and several others) but this one hasn't even curbed my pain. I've had to cancel all my plans for today to wait for the antibiotics I'm also taking to kick in. Pain is next to unbearable_ and I've taken 2 Advil extra strength liquid capsules which have just now kicked in and made me able to drink some water without wanting to cry. I've been using clove oil also_ but the pain is very persistent. I'm going to the dentist in a month and getting the tooth taken out_ but he said I need to have an antibiotic treatment before then. I don't believe the walk-in doctor exactly knew what he was giving me_ because he took a few moments before writing it down and giving it to me. Hopefully it kicks in_ but he said within 15 minutes of taking it I should be feeling the effects....nothing yet and it's been 2_ almost 3 hours. Very dissatisfied and I wish I was able to get in to see my regular doctor today. Hopefully I'll be able to catch some sleep tonight.,F,16,7  days50 MG,7/27/2015,Indomethacin

15, 2, Gout,Uncontrollable racing & pounding heart beat_ extreme dizziness & nausea.  Felt as if I was in a thick fog.,First ever bout with gout.  Took 25mg Indomethacin at bedtime with a Tramadol for pain. The Tramadol helped me sleep comfortably so may not have been aware of any Indomethacin side effects.  Swelling and pain was reduced in the morning.  In the afternoon_ took another Indomethacin while awake_ within an hour_ my heart began racing uncontrollably and was experiencing extreme dizziness.  When your heart begins racing and pounding uncontrollably and your head is spinning... it's extremely scary and nerve wracking.  Nearly called 911 as I thought I was having a heart attack due to the medicine  The on & off extreme rapid heart beat finally subsided after an hour.  Though it does relieve swelling & pain rather rapidly_ I'll never take this stuff again due to the horrendous side effects.,M,43,1  days25 2X D,7/15/2015,Indomethacin
16, 5, Gout,Dizziness,Taking for gout flare up. Works a lot better than Advil but makes me dizzy and that's not fun. Using colchicine to help with flare up and indo for swelling/minimal pain relief.

18, 1, Heel sour,Numbness of the face_ felt like someone had given me anesthesia_ like I was gonna pass out. Throat felt like it was closing up and tighting of the chest. I felt like I was losing my mind. Very afraid,I was driving home from work talking to my mom and telling her I didn't feel right then my face started getting numb. I hung up and called my husband and then told him about it and then my throat felt like it was closing up and I had a tighting in my chest. He immediately told me pull over now and call 911. I did but I felt foolish. They came and put me in the ambulance. They wanted to take me to the hospital but I decided to go home. I do remember the emt guy asking if I had ever had a panic attack. I said no cause I haven't. After reading all these reviews I realize I wasn't crazy it has happened to others with this drug. I'm sorry but after what I went through people need More warnings about this medicine! I can promise you I will Never Ever take this medicine again!! I have never been so scared. I thought I was gonna die.,F,48,1  days50mg,6/27/2015Email,Indomethacin

20, 3, Gout,The first time I took Indomethacin someone had to drive me home from work for blurry vision. During my last gout attack_ I took it on the weekend and spent a lot of time on the couch. My vision was off again and I could not concentrate on anything. The pain did go away and the bottle says only take for pain_ so I stopped after 2 days. I am taking Colchicine to control the gout now and only using the Indomethacin if I absolutely need it and not leaving the house.,,M,41,2  days25 MG 3X D,6/10/2015,Indomethacin
21, 2, Gout (Foot Inflammation),After the first dose with a moderately sized meal_ quite nauseous and and drowsy within an hour; had to lay down and ended up sleeping for about 2 hours; woke up with mild lightheaded feeling. 2nd dose was in the evening before bed_ so I think I likely slept through any side effects. Worked great for the gout pain in the morning of the next day (took pain from about a 7/10 to a 2/10) and so I didn't take any more doses on the 2nd day; though had a mild intermittent tingling feeling in limbs throughout the day. 3rd day morning_ pain had gone back up to about a 4/10_ so took another dose with breakfast cereal (light meal) and went into work. About 1.5 hours later_ became quite dizzy_ drowsy_ diarrhea_ anxious; decided to leave work and drive home when I probably shouldn't have. Upon getting home_ fell asleep on the couch for about an hour to sleep off the feelings; woke up feeling groggy.,Rating as a 2/5 because it did great at alleviating the gout pain / inflammation however the side effects were too debilitating.,M,29,3  days50 MG 2X D,6/5/2015,Indomethacin

24, 1, Hip Surgery,Head ache_ Breathing issues_ ringing in ears_ extreme anxiety/panic_ out of body experience_ Hot flashes_ Anger/ irritability,Everything was OK for the first few days then I awoke day 6 around 4 AM feeling anxious and having trouble breathing. I slept a few more hours on the couch sitting up. As that day progressed   I started to feel extremely hot_ early March with 4 feet of snow on the ground and I had windows open and my shirt off curled in a ball on the couch. It was a out of body experience like watching life as a movie but a scary movie. I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I could not cool off and I could not catch my breath. At one point I had  issues understanding how to use my cell phone and lights were too bright. it was sensory over load. I had unbelievable claustrophobia and all sorts of unexplained fear. Today is day 4 off of the medication_ each day is a little better with the help of some anxiety medication but I still have slight anxiety from time to time. I have had a panic attack before but it was nothing like this_ I thought I was losing my mind. As others have mentioned if you feel any of this it is defiantly the meds not you!

Took my third dose that evening after supper and felt ok. Friday morning_ same reaction_ but the afternoon dose gave me such terrible side effects that I had to lie down. I called 811 and talked with a registered nurse_ drank some fruit juice_ and elevated my legs. I felt terrible for about 6 hours. I didn't take my third dose and will never touch this drug again!! The side effects are very scary.  I read that indomethacin is a good SECOND choice! I think that if you are going to take this drug_ take it after a FULL meal at night because the side effects are not as bad as than if you take it with a small snack.,F,40,4  days50mg 3X D,2/2/2013Email,Indomethacin
59, 1, hemicrania continua & cluster hdach,lightheadedness_ palpitations_ drowsiness_ lethargy. blurred vision,Initially gave some relief to the hemicrania/cluster headache combo that I have with 1 25mg per day. That worked for a couple of weeks_ but eventually had to start increasing dosage to 3X/day and then I started with side effects; which now already outnumber the reason for initially taking it.   No stomach upset as I take Zegerid daily. I also had a nerve block injection to help relieve the daily pain. Neither the Indo nor the shot has worked. I still have the daily headaches. Could be the fact that headaches are still daily is also a side effect of the Indo so_ as of today_ I am going off the Indo since the side effects are mounting up. I will try a 2nd nerve block to see if it works without the Indo.,,68,45  days25 mg 3X D,12/10/2012Email,Indomethacin
