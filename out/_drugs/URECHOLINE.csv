0, 3, neurogenic bladder condition,Extreme thirst at times_ fatigue_ very frequent urination (maybe a symptom of the nerve injury)_ sometimes it doesn't seem to work as well as others -- seems to depend on how irritated the damaged spinal nerve involved is and/or maybe how much pressure there is on the nerve and or bladder. Symptoms generally get worse around my menses.,I get this medication from the local Costco Pharmacy_ which serves a huge number of people_ and was amazed to learn that I'm the only customer taking it regularly. I take 10 mg 4x a day. I would love not to need this medication_ but without it apparently my bladder does not empty completely. I started taking it after having hardware from a failed lumbar fusion removed. That's when I developed the symptoms_ which are very uncomfortable.,F,47,2  days,8/29/2008Email,Urecholine
