1, 5, blood pressure,none,Having been on this for 7 years with no side effects that I know of_ I can't believe the low ratings.

19, 1, High blood pressure,I am taking the generic lisinoprol.  Previously all hair loss stopped early in 2010.  Now it suddenly reappeared with a vengance.  Runny nose all the time.  I thought it may have been allergy season but now after reading this stuff_ it may be the Rx.  My blood pressure got up to the 160s over the 90s.  After taking this Rx_ it is down to 123/60.  The MD is happy with this.,My initial discomfort came as always feeling really cold. I have been so cold at work that I have to wear an under shirt_ top_ jacket and scarf. While the AC is aggressive during the summer at work_ I have NEVER been this cold before.  Feel stupid all bundled up. Is anyone else feeling super cold??I don't feel like I am choking but anything is swelling_ but I am no longer able to swallow my multi vitamin. I feel like I will choke so I don't do it.  These plus calcium were never an issue but now they are.  Could this be something like low grade swelling of throat??,M,60,45  days10 mg 1X D,9/16/2010Email,Zestril

I actually take the gen. brand lisinopril and it lowers my bp from 140/80 to a number of readings 133/129/118 all over 80 or lower. I also think its what I eat at times when I do the right thing my bp stays in the disierd area. So the most important thing is watching what you eat and most definantlly EXCERSIZE.

35, 4, High Blood Pressure,"No side effects for me. Although_ I know some people have what's called ""ACE Cough"" so this side effect is possible. Basically_ I've had no side effects.",Seems to be an easy to tolerate drug for me_ but alone it will not lower blood pressure very much.

40, 1, high blood pressuer,The main side effects I have are an itchy throat most of the time; coughing all day and into the night which keeps me from sleeping (my husband says I cough during the night also); and some shortness of breath. Other things I have noticed since reading this website are: fatigue_ mental fogginess_ mild leg cramps_ gagging/choking for no reason (not because of eating or drinking something).,My voice has seemed to change also. I am a preschool music teacher and have had difficulty teaching & singing through the morning. I also sing in a choir and have had problems singing. It seems that the more I try to sing_ it brings on more coughing and hoarseness. Very frustrating!,F,54,11  months,6/30/2009Email,Zestril

44, 1, High blood pressure,dizziness_ mild head aches_ and occasional coughing spells.,I can't say I recommend this med because it does not work as good as a lot of doctors think. I have had high blood pressure since I was 16 and I was in great shape then so I get sick and tired of hearing about weight being a main issue to high blood pressure. That said_ playing sports_ sleeping more and keeping stress low does more to lower my high bp than this med ever has. I take it with one other med to get my bp down and I'm lucky if it goes to 150 over 100. Don't waste your time and money on this med_ its not worth it.,M,28,1  years,2/22/2009,Zestril

46, 5, High Blood Pressure,Mild dizziness_ kind of a slightly enjoyable tipsiness,It does the job_ is very basic_ and is available in a generic form.  Wonderful value if it works for you.  More expensive medications haven't done even half as much for me.  Also think that the general mechanism for its function benefits my demeanor and leaves me more pleasant.  Wonderful medication that is derived from viper venom.,M,28,5  years,10/14/2008,Zestril
47, 1, maintain low blood pressure,sore limbs_ fatigue_ cloudiness feeling_ stomach cramps_ diareha_ short term memory loss_ tiredness_ required lots of sleep_ depression_ mood swings,I began taking this medicine after emergency heart surgery to help maintain a low blood pressure_ and prior to that my blood pressure was always around 120/80_ now it seems to hover around 200/130. The side effects of this medicine has endangered my ability to earn a living and someone from the FDA should check into how this medicine was ever allowed to market with all the documented issues surrounding it. In reading the associated comments I am quite distured by the amount of physicians which are either grossly misinformed about the medicines they prescribe or intentionally prescibe these medicines with known issues to help line their own pockets at the patients health expense. Something needs to be done about this.,M,51,2  months,7/29/2008Email,Zestril

Stated_ cough is a common side effect--guess they left that out earlier!!!  Type of cough that makes your boss want you to stay home_ keeps you up all night long and no cough medicine subsides it.,Dizziness symptoms also experienced.
