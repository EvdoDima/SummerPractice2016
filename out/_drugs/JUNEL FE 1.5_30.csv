9, 3, Birth control_ hormonal fluctuation,I've was on junel about 3 years ago and was satisfied with it completely. I went off it and got horrible hormonal acne and I'm 28_ eat organic_ non GMO_ etc!

My boobs have become plumper and tender_ I am extremely bloated to where my pants barely button and my scale says I've gained about 5 pounds in a month. I'm gonna give it another 2 months because I've heard these symptoms lessen. Also_ my sex drive has not dipped_ if anything_ it's increased.

12, 1, Birth Control,"I would took this birth control for 3 months and had to stop. I went to the emergency room for the first time in my life because of it.

16, 3, Prevent Cysts that occur with ovula,The first 2-3 weeks of taking this pill were hell. I was irritable_ angry_ no sex drive_ my breasts went up a cup size and were tender all the time_ and other symptoms such as hemorroids and heartburn (which I'm not sure is related),After one month of taking this pill_ these symptoms went away completely. I got my libido back_ my breasts are back to normal (boo) and i feel normal again. I guess you have to give this pill a month for your body to adjust.
