0, 5, Chronic Pain,I felt utterly 'high' and very sick after the first few doses_ but my body soon adjusted to it. I find it causes insomnia if taken in the evening. Can be rough on the tummy.,This has been a wonder drug for me. The only medication that has ever completely taken away my pain and enabled me to carry on with 'normal' working daily life. If used with caution_ it can literally change the quality of life of pain sufferers. However_ as it is now a controlled drug_ and GP's will no longer prescribe it long term_ I am being taken off it. Attempting to wean your brain & central nervous system off the drug is not pleasant in my experience. However_ I understand some people have no problems at all. I stopped after initially trialing it for 1 month and had restless legs for 2 nights and that was that. After the past 9 months_ cutting down from  200mg to 50mg has left me constantly waking at night_ and feeling restless legs during sleep_ as well as general flailing about the bed due to nerve twitching. Apparently this passes after a week or so!! Excellent relief when nsaids_ codeines etc do not touch your pain_ but do not take daily as you will only have to go through withdrawal in the future.,F,36,10  months100mg 2X D,7/12/2016,Tramadol hydrochloride
1, 5, Restless Leg Syndrome,None,Have not had RLS in a year while taking 1 50MG per day.  I take one at night time only. It does elevate your mood by making you more relaxed.  Highly recommended this drug for RLS.  It may have the capability of being addictive but I have not felt it yet.  I have missed doses and have had no issues.,M,32,1  years50 MG,7/12/2016,Tramadol hydrochloride
2, 1, Arthritis & degenerative discs,This med destroyed my life! Extreme depression_ anxiety_ no motivation to even leave the house. After 5 yrs it no longer works & I now have to try to wean down to try to get my life back. Haven't been able to get below 7 a day. This drug is the devil,If I could've I'd have taken NSAIDs but can't due to gastric bypass surgery. My advice is look at all that's written about this horrible drug & try anything else! I wish I had,F,55,5  years8-12 a day,3/9/2016Email,Tramadol hydrochloride

5, 5, Degenerative Disc Disease,Energy boost,Taking this for degenerative disc disease in my lower back in L1 and L2. Two 50mg pills in the morn and again late at night.  Helps get rid of stiffness in my back and hips_ allows me to walk and move much better and function during the day. Gives me an energy boost too for some reason.  It can be addictive if you stop taking it suddenly_ you will have withdrawals_ taper down slowly if you must. For me I take it everyday or else I have trouble sitting and walking and doing normal things during the day_ it helps me a lot.,F,41,5  years100 mg 2X D,5/19/2015Email,Tramadol hydrochloride
6, 1, fibromyalgia,Worked well for pain but found that I would get irritable and depressed when it started to wear off. Withdrawal was horrible! I couldn't sleep_ had depression_ anxiety and restless legs. I would not recorecommend this medication to anyone!,,F,48,2  years,3/8/2015Email,Tramadol hydrochloride
7, 5, Arthritis & fibro myalgia,None. Tramadol has changed my life. I've had a hip replacement & fibro myalgia is debilitating. I work 4 days a week as a high school teacher - which might be more than I am capable of_ if it weren't for tramadol. I came off Tramadol for 2 weeks without withdrawal symptoms earlier this year before having an operation for carpel tunnel syndrome.,,F,60,3  years150,1/6/2015,Tramadol hydrochloride
8, 1, Post Inguinal Hernia complications,*PLEASE READ*(All side effects (withdrawals) listed are 2 months after tapering off medication. (While on Tramadol my pain was much alleviated and my mood/happiness was lifted greatly..but then things changed.)*RLS*Insomnia*Nausea*Muscle & Bones Ache*DEPRESSION_ ANXIETY_ Dissociative Disorder*Hopeless state of being_ ETC.,As said_ after the mesh plate that was used to patch up my hernia started to cause problems_ specifically nerve entrapment_ I was put on Tramadol. My dose was increased to 400 MG and for the first 3 years it was the best medication I had ever used to alleviate the pain. I also found that Tramadol made me a happier_ more energetic person. I have read it has been used to treat depression in some cases. I found this to be true. I started loving this medication more for how it made me feel_ rather than how it controlled my chronic pain.Fast forward to now:After 3 years and 7 months of taking this medication_ I made the decision that I needed to tell my Doctor I needed off of this medication. Simply put_ I was taking it for the wrong reasons. I was semi-gradually weaned off of this medication (2 month process) and have been Tramadol free for almost 2 months.As many have mentioned_ I promise you that for me_ this withdrawal experience has been a absolute hell on earth. The first 2 weeks were mostly physical withdrawals. Believe it or not_ but although I was sicker then I have ever been in my life_ my decision to quit this med was my motivating factor that pushed me through the first couple weeks of intense_ horrific physical withdrawals. However_ 2 months later_ I am still barely holding on. The mental withdrawals have not eased at all. Although I am still dealing with slight insomnia_ restless leg and nausea_ depression_ severe anxiety_ panic attacks and a general attitude,M,31,4  years50 MG 8X D,12/15/2014Email,Tramadol hydrochloride
9, 5, Adrenomyeloneuropathy- pain,Itching mild at times,"This is the only pain medicine that helps my chronic pain. I take 1/2 tab once or twice a day most days of the week_ then try to take a few days off to prevent tolerance. I hate having to take medicine but without it_ my quality of life stinks. A niceBonus is that it helps with my chronic low grade depression. My mood and energy improve to ""normal"". No dizziness or ""high"" from this med which I like. I can function well and enjoy life again.",F,39,1  years10 mg/day,12/2/2014,Tramadol hydrochloride
10, 5, Chronic pain from Lupus and FM,Constipation_ and in the beginning overall itchiness which is pretty much gone,Tramadol is a life saver for me. I would wake up every early morning in severe pain_ and it took hours before I could get moving. Now I take 150 mg at 4:00 am_ go back to sleep_ and wake up around 7:30 - 8:00 am_ ready to start the day. I am so thankful for this medication. I know it doesn't work for everyone_ but for me it has been a miracle medication.,F,43,1  years150 mg 1X D,8/23/2014,Tramadol hydrochloride
11, 1, For severe_ lower back pain,I  have severe osteoarthritis in my lower spine with facet joint narrowing and some compression injury. For pain_ as I cannot be operated on as yet_ Dr's prescribed 50mg's Tramadol to be taken 2 to 3 times daily.Initially it *did* help for the pain and it lifted my mood too. But in time I came up with a whole lot of other serious conditions. I started to have severe heart palpitations. Was put onto Sota-Hexal to cope with those! Then started to walk as if I am 100 years old. Extremely stiff_ painful legs from the soles of my feet to my groin area. This stiffness also moved to my arms_ neck and shoulders.Dr's said this could not be due to the meds.I started with gradual restless-leg-syndrome to where it became chronic.I just could not understand why I was feeling SO ill! When my leg stiffness became so bad that I could no longer climb stairs and had difficulty even climbing into the bath or shower cubicle - I finally researched Tramadol on the internet and discovered how so many o,I have been off Tramadol for a few weeks now and have managed to get myself back down to only 40 mg's of Sota-Hexal for the palpitations. I am sure those will disappear too as they only started a short while after I had gone onto Tramadol. The restless-leg-syndrome is not gone yet but it is not quite as chronic as it was for a couple of months. I can gradually feel the life coming back into my stiff limbs.This has been a *horrific* medication for me and i am very angry that no Dr ever warned me about the risk side-effects nor took notice when I complained about symptoms I had never experienced before.Perhaps my brain and Central Nervous System is more sensitive than that of most people but I would warn anyone to think very carefully about the risks you face when you decide to start taking this med.,F,57,6  months50mg 3X D,6/25/2014Email,Tramadol hydrochloride
12, 4, broken coccyx / lumbar nerve damage,I'd broken my coccyx and had tried cortisol injections_ naproxen and co-dydramol which all only work semi-well on a short term basis. I was in severe pain_ in tears and could not sleep. This was a blessing to start. I started at 50mg twice a day_ then leading upto three times a day. The only side effect at the time being heavy eyelids. But after nearly two years of taking them_ to have the same level of effective pain relief (doesn't take it away_ but is manageable) i now need to take 200mg in the morning. I fond this lasts untill early evening_ when i take another 200mg before an early night. I must say over time_ it had left me feeling groggy and grubby. It is hard to tell if this is fatigue from my disorder_ or a side effect. Either way_ i find very effective at keep the extreme discomfort at bay and lead a mobile life. I do notice the pain hots like a wall when drug has run out. Must be doing something right. Though i would prefer not to have to take it for too long.,,F,28,2  years200mg,3/27/2014,Tramadol hydrochloride

Usually I only need to take a half tablet 2 or 3 times a day to be able to function in my job and daily routine and lead a fairly normal life.

Whether you're tapering or going cold turkey you will be in a world of hell for a few weeks. Withdrawals include RLS_ sever depression_ sever insomnia_ cold sweats_ diarrhea_ after days and days of no sleep I started to hear and see things that were not there. All that plus intense joint pain. It is not a good situation at all. Please beware when taking this medication.

Insomnia_slight itching.,I only take 1/2 pill at a time_ usually twice a day (morning and afternoon) because of the sleeplessness it causes.

Should have done my homework like I usually do. I was shocked to have withdrawal symptoms the first day I skipped the med. Started to wean off it...... when taking only 1/2 to 1 a day instead of 2-3_ had twitches/jerking in arms and legs when at rest. Stopped altogether now. Tho excellent for pain would not take again due to addictive quality and unnerving anxiety trying to stop the drug. My Dr. was surprised at my report_ says many pts. are fine on it.

37, 5, Menstrual Cramps,Itching! Hazy_ drugged (but NOT dizzy) feeling. Sometimes sleepy_ sometimes insomnia. Figure that one out.,I get horrible painful cramps that cause vomiting and other fun symptoms every month. My doctor prescribed Tramadol_ and it's pretty awesome for me. Ibuprofin just makes me vomit and other OTCs don't even touch the pain even if I up the dosage. I didn't want to go all the way to vicodin because it makes me SO dizzy it's hard to walk straight which doesn't help the nausea. So I do tramadol_ which brings the pain down to a manageable level_ which helps (a little) with the nausea. Hazy makes me unwilling to drive while taking it_ but nausea makes me unwilling to go anywhere while I need it_ so not a big deal. Most of the time I get the sleepies which is actually GREAT_ because I can sometimes sleep through the pain. And I don't get an intense itching_ just a very mild_ persistent allover itch which I will gladly trade for the horrible pain.I was actually totally unaware that tramadol had issues with addiction/withdrawal until reading other people's comments. I only need the tramadol for the first day_ so I only take one or two pills every month and have no issues at all with that. The hazy and itching only last as long as the pill does.,F,27,1  years50 MG 1X M,5/17/2011,Tramadol hydrochloride

39, 5, Fibromyalgia_ ADD_ Depression,Trouble sleeping if taken too close to bedtime.,I LOVE TRAMADOL_  its my WONDER DRUG.  I had been on Ritalin and all sorts of anti depressants but when I started taking Tramadol I was able to drop everything and stick with one drug to do it all.  My fibromyalgia takes the best out of me.  I hurt everywhere_ I'm constantly cold and I walk around like an old lady with arthritis (im 36)  I usually wake up dragging and in pain but within 30 minutes of taking my Tramadol I feel upbeat happy and ready to conquer the world.  I notice that when I miss a dose I start feeling depressed but unlike the other antidepressants I have tried_ I don't have to wait days for my tramadol to build up before it takes effect.   My tramadol was prescribed for my Fibromyalgia pain but had done soooo much more for me.  It has given me a new outlook on life.  I can focus on my daily duties_ I have stopped yelling at my son and have stopped crying for no reason at all.  I think the FDA should approve tramadol for depression because IT WORKS_ unfortunately not for everyone but for many!,F,36,5  years100MG 3X D,4/4/2011Email,Tramadol hydrochloride
40, 1, Post shoulder operation,Okay as long as I kept up dosage. Worked fine for controlling the pain but?.,I only ever took these Tramadol tablets as prescribed for post operative pain so according to the manufacturers web site_ I?m not addicted. To be classified as addicted you must be abusing the tablets. Things were fine until I stopped after 6 weeks. I had not been warned about the potential withdrawal effects which included sensory sensitivity_ itching_ hyper anxiety_ extreme insomnia_ panic etc. I started taking the Tramadol again and this time reduced over 2 weeks_ as soon as I stopped completely_ all the withdrawal affects described above came back. It is now 2 weeks since my last tablet and I?m still suffering from insomnia and anxiety_ I?m not able to deal with more than one question at a time otherwise I panic. I am a professional person with a responsible job but currently unable to work. I really wish the drug company and the doctors warned patients about the potential problems of coming off of these tablets_ it would have been easier to suffer the post op pain_ at least you know where you are with that.,M,55,6  weeks100mg 4X D,1/19/2011Email,Tramadol hydrochloride
