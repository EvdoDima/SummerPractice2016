0, 4, sinus infection,None_ I tolerated this antibiotic well. It seems to be a relatively friendly antibiotic relative to some others...,"Rated ""4"" because it is unclear if it truly helped clear the infection_ as is always the problem with sinus infections. I was regularly doing saline flushes several times a day_ and it could've resolved on its own.",M,27,15  days375mg 2X D,4/13/2015Email,Cefaclor

2, 5, severe bronchitis,None.  No diarrhoea.  Well tolerated.,Severe chest infection that didn't respond to amoxicillin_ erythromycin or zithromax (z-pak)_ given in that order.  Infection lasted several weeks.  Finally doc gave me cefaclor_ after 6-7 days huge improvement_ which carried on improving for a few days after I finished the course.  Completely cleared the infection.  Very effective drug.  Doc told me they prefer to keep it in reserve for difficult infections to avoid bugs developing resistance_ if I get another infection they will want to try amoxicillin first before using this again.,M,47,7  days250 3X D,3/2/2011,Cefaclor
