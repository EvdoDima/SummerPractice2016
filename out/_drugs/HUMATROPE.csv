1, 5, for adult growth hormone deficiency,None to date.,Before taking Humatrope_ my growth hormone levels were so low that I couldn't even stay awake.  I lost my drivers licence because they didn't know what was wrong with me.  Finally_ my endo tested me for this and since injecting daily_ I can finally stay awake and have my licence back.,F,46,2  years,8/22/2009,Humatrope
