0, 1, Seborrhea on jaw,Permanent severe_ engulfing acne on face_ permanent severe coarse_ black facial hair (I'm a woman_) extremely red face now manifesting as milder rosacea.,These topicals should never be used for than a week_ maximum.  When I developed the terrible side effects_ I went to six doctors_ all of whom told me steroid creams had no side effects whatsoever.  All they had to do was read the drug company's accompanying literature:  Severe acne_ hirsutism (facial hair) and rosacea_ as well as a list of other side effects longer than your leg.  I was kept on the cream for seven years.  Every time I tried to stop_ my skin inflamed even more (rebound rosacea typical of steroid topicals.)  When I finally found out the truth--such symptoms are not only side effects_ but permanent--it was too late.,F,57,7  years,10/27/2009,Aristocort
