0, 4, rosacea_ seborrheic dermatitis,Very dry skin. Good moisturizer solved that problem.,My worst trigger is heat. If I just remember to apply it twice a day (only during the summer) the redness is completely controlled. During the winter once a day is enough.,F,54,3  years 2X D,7/17/2010,Metrogel
1, 3, BV,"I saw that everyone had the clumpy disscharge that I also had. I talk to my dr and I said ""was it supposed to make me itchy?"" the first the she asked was ""did you have white clumpy disscharge"" i replied ""yes"" and she so ohh if you had that clumpy disscharge then you didnt have BV you actually had a yeast infection. so all of you guys were prob prescribed the wrong treatment.",it made me itchy and I had white clumpy discharge.,F,20,7  days 1X W,6/28/2010,Metrogel
2, 2, facial rosacea,Dry skin and my eyes have puffy bags underneath them. I look like I've been on a bender! Skin feels like plastic. Rash still present_ unchanged.,"My dermatologist ""thinks"" I have Rosacea so she prescribed this_ but I'm not really sure what I have. About 2 months ago_ I just started having red raised bumps on forehead and scattered on cheeks_ a few on chin. It is NOT acne since I have had acne when I was younger and this has no resemblance to it. It also itches slightly. I'm feeling very helpless.By the way_ posts here should only be for the topical gel. NOT any other form!",F,67,3  daysgel 1% 1X D,4/27/2010Email,Metrogel
3, 3, rosacea,Metrogel VAGINAL reviews should NOT be posted here and should be ignored because this is NOT the site for Metrogel VAGINAL.,Metrogel is applied to the face to control redness.  Metrogel VAGINAL is inserted into the vagina.  Do NOT confuse the two.  This is the site for Metrogel.  This is NOT the site for Metrogel VAGINAL.,F,63,1  years 1X D,4/7/2010,Metrogel
4, 1, supposed BV,Immediately felt like I'd been poisoned and felt very weird_ out-of-it_ almost out-of-body feeling; developed peripheral neuropathy within just hours from elbows to tips of fingers and from knees down to toes.,,F,27,1  days 1X D,4/6/2010,Metrogel
5, 5, moderate acne/very mild rosacea,None,I think some reviewers must be confusing this with a different forumulation of Metrogel. My review is for the topical formula. I used it on my face 2 x's per day at my OB's suggestion due to jawline/cheek acne and mild redness in my t-zone.  I noticed better results with this than with Obagi Nuderm/Tretinion. I could tell within a few days that it was working. If you look on the product website you will find a very good coupon for the product!,F,26,2  weeks,11/24/2009,Metrogel
6, 4, Perioral Dermatitis_ Rosacea,Some increased redness on my cheeks_ decreased redness around my nose/lips,Made my rosacea (on my cheeks) much worse_ yet made my perioral derm (around my nose_ under my lips/on my chin) much better.  I saw some improvement_ though not tons_ with the metrogel alone. Same with an oral AB-some progress but not tons. However in combination with the oral AB the perioral derm has almost completely resolved itself.,F,26,6  months,11/1/2009,Metrogel
7, 4, Rosacea,Slightly dry skin_ nothing terrible,Used twice per day.  Significantly reduced overall inflammation and redness.  Unfortunately_ recent work stress caused a flair up that Metrogel was not enough to overcome.,F,40,9  months,10/23/2009,Metrogel
8, 5, BV,No side effects. I actually drank while using it and had no side effects. If you take the Oral medication you will be VERY ILL. Don't even have a sip of alcohol.,I think I took used the gel once a day for 7 days. It was awhile ago so I don't really remember but let me tell you its a miracle! I was so embarressed. I asked a good friend thats a doctor about what i should do and he recommended it. So thankful.,F,26, ,4/13/2009,Metrogel
9, 5, Rosacea,None,I have taken it twice a day for about 3 years. It solved my long standing Rosacea problem with no ill effects.,M,80,3  years,10/17/2008,Metrogel
10, 5, acne,I have not had any side effects so far! Take note that several of the people rating on here are NOT reviewing the topical acne rosacea drug METROGEL_ but it sounds like its oral antibiotic/anti-fungal form used for other conditions.  They are clearly in the WRONG place for review.,"Derms have only dx'd me with acne (NOT rosacea)_ but a new derm prescribed this after I was unable to continue using Finacea (which worked well_ but which caused a severe flare-up of my formerly controlled asthma in less than one month).  He said Metrogel works similarly to Finacea.  I also take 50 mg of spiro a day and use topical Benzamycin and Klaron at night on my skin_ but the addition of Metrogel in the morning has been really excellent.  In only a few weeks_ my skin has become sooo much smoother and regained the ""bright"" look of normal female facial skin.  I am really happy; it has worked symbiotically very well with my other derm meds to make my skin much better!",F,31,4  weeks,10/10/2008,Metrogel
11, 1, ,headaches_ naseua_ vomting_ a really bad taste in my mouth. I just felt really crappy and drained all the time even after i stopped taking the meds.,these meds worked really good but the side effects are too hard to deal with. they needs to make another type of med without all the horrible side effects b/c i couldnt even finsh all of the medicene i only got to three days and i was directed to take if for seven. and even after i stopped the side effects kept occuring DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!!!!,F,20,3  days,3/12/2008,Metrogel
12, 2, acne roseacea,No side-effects. No benefits_ either.,I may as well have been putting KY Jelly on my face. I had no side-effects_ but I also noticed no change whatsoever. I would still recommend TRYING it_ because it may work for you... but it did absolutely nothing for me_ good or bad.,M,35,6  months,7/10/2007Email,Metrogel
13, 2, perioral dermatitis,Extreme dryness (sometimes to the point of the skin cracking and bleeding)_ scaling_ slight itch,I was prescribed Metrogel for perioral dermatitis and it didn't do squat!  My skin was still red_ scaly_ and bumpy around my nose_ mouth_ and chin; the Metrogel just added extreme dryness to the mix.  Metrogel made my skin so dry it would crack and bleed - not a very pleasant thing for a young woman to have on her face!  When I told my doctor the gel wasn't working_ she prescribed me an oral antibiotic.  My skin looks a lot better_ but I feel like a zombie.  I guess I would rather have a rash than be in a constant stupor...,F,22,2  weeks,11/2/2006,Metrogel
14, 1, acne rosacea,alcohol intolerance,My dermatologist prescribed Metrogel for acne rosecea on my nose. It works_ but for months I had to give up my habit of a beer or two with dinner because even a single beer caused rapid hearbeat_ flushing_ insomnia_ and the next day it felt like I'd had 6 beers instead of 1. In the Metrogel product literature there was no mention of adverse reaction to alcohol_ but I finally figured it out myself by researching the side effects of oral Metronidazole.  When I stopped using Metrogel_ the alcohol intolerance went away.  Even if you don't drink_ you have to wonder how good it is to have low levels of this antibiotic constantly in your bloodstream.  Another case of drug companies downplaying side effects_ I think.,M,48,2  years,9/13/2006,Metrogel
15, 1, rosacea,none - yet,metronidazole causes cancer in mice and rats but not hamsters according to the package insert.  I'd rather have rosacea than cancer.,F,36,5  days,3/22/2006,Metrogel
16, 2, Bacterial Vaginosis,It has been horrible. A Yeast Infection. Mild abdominal cramps_ just feeling crappy. Cottage Cheese like discharge_ yellowish white.,,F,40,7  days,2/6/2006,Metrogel
17, 1, BV during pregnancy,Cramping for a whole day_ which caused  a lot of anxiety_ as I'm 5 months pregnant- my ob/gyn decided to take me off the medication after one dose as a result. She found cottage cheese-like discharge already after one day- she thought it was candida_ which I did not have the day before when she examined me. I also have developed very dry and tingly lips and cracks in the corner of my mouth.,It's poison in my opinion. I would never take this again. I'm just grateful my baby appears to be OK.,F,42,1  days,9/21/2005,Metrogel
18, 5, rosacea,none so far,works pretty good. a lot of the redness is barely visible after 1 or 2 application,M,36,3  days,7/16/2005,Metrogel
19, 1, Rosacea,Very intense numbing and tingling in the upper legs,,F,44,6  days,4/29/2005,Metrogel
