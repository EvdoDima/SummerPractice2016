0, 1, Stents,Shortness of breath itching all over boby,Should not be on the market,M,42,2  weeks90mg,6/12/2016Email,Brilinta
1, 3, 2 stents placed after heart attack,I have experienced some shortness of breath and fatigue but my worst symptom is massive bruising with the slightest bump. I bruise so easily_ I can't tell you when I bumped something to cause it and the bruising is so bad it looks as if I have fallen down the stairs. I end up with a huge black and purple bruise down my arm after leaning it on my desk to use the mouse.,My doctor wants me on it for a year but will put me on Plavix if I desire. I don't know what to do. I'm afraid a head bump will cause a brain bleed.,F,38,1  months90 mg,5/17/2016Email,Brilinta
2, 5, Stent,None so far!,The age I entered is correct everyone! I experienced the scariest time of my life last week- heart attack- I had been feeling like something was REALLY wrong with my ticker for about a month and a half before my heart attack - been in and out of the cardiologist office_ emergency rooms_ and a couple of ambulances. Everyone told me it was nothing - probably anxiety. Had LOTS of tests done with nothing being revealed - so by the time I had my heart attack_ I thought it must be nothing_ really bad heartburn maybe. IT WAS NOT.  My entire family is in medicine and it wasn't until I couldn't feel my left hand and my chest and arm pain were so bad that I was scream crying that I felt I needed to get some help. ANYWAY- I am so lucky that I'm alive and okay!!!! I have a stint and I'm on this Rx_ and 8 days after having a heart attack_ I feel better than I've felt in many many months.  This Rx is working fine for me so far but if there's anything to learn from my experience_ it's that we MUST be our own advocates!!!! Tell doctors everything!!! BOTHER them!!!! MAKE THEM LISTEN. If they won't_ please find one who will.,F,38,1  days90mg X 2,2/4/2016Email,Brilinta

5, 1, 4 heart stents,rectal bleeding,Problem probably relates to crohn's disease.  Tried Plavix but it seemed to make the problem worse.,M,70,10  months90 2X D,11/17/2015Email,Brilinta

7, 1, Had 1 stent put in,After 36 hours on the drug_ I began experiencing Atrial Fibrillation. I also experienced a panic attack. The first panic attack that I had since 2006.,I had an EPC Cell capture stent put in_ so I'm hoping that the stent will heal itself quickly and I can just continue with the aspirin.,M,61,2  days90 2X D,6/26/2015Email,Brilinta
8, 1, 3 DES stents,The cough!  The cough!  The cough! Fatigue_ brain fog_ no stamina_ bruising and nosebleeds.,I have never had COPD_ don't smoke_ never had allergies and have never had a cough like this until this drug.  It is a dry and constant cough. It_ more than anything_ will be the one factor in making me go off the drug.  The brain fog is irritating and not normal; the fatigue is also lessening what I can do and for how long.  This is not good.,F,62,3  months90mg 2X D,5/15/2015Email,Brilinta
9, 2, heart stents,Primary side effect difficulty breathing...,with no generic available I requested my cardiologist prescribe a generic substitute that is older & exhibits less side effects according to reviews I've read. So far so good.. Greatly improved breathing & much less expensive,M,62,6  months90 mg 2X D,4/9/2015,Brilinta
10, 1, Stent placement,Serious brain fog_ which I suppose is ok if you lay around all day. I can't function on this med. Feel doped up and high 24/7. Am going to ask my doc to change it.Other symptoms_ bruising_ shortness of breath_ ringing in the ears.,,F,46,2  months90mg 2xday,11/30/2014Email,Brilinta
11, 3, Angeoplasty with Two stents,Suffering from severe coughing_ now and then chest pain.,Drug cost high.,M,59,3  months90 mg- two,11/2/2014Email,Brilinta
12, 1, 2 heart stints,Just released from hospital with severe anemia due to acute bleeding (menstrual)_ low blood pressure_ low heart rate. Nearly went into shock from blood loss.,This drug should not be given to women who still have periods. Plavix worked_ had fewer side effects_ and didn't send me to the ER thinking I was having another heart attack.,F,38,3  months90 MG 2X D,9/28/2014,Brilinta
13, 5, two heart stents,Bruising however that is to be expected from a blood thinner.,,M,46,4  months30MG,4/10/2014Email,Brilinta
14, 2, Anti-Platelet drug because of stent,I could not tolerate side effects.  Felt like I was having a heart attack!  Went back to Effient (which I took after 1st stent) and am doing fine!,,F,69,5  days90 mg 2X D,10/19/2013EmailHistory,Brilinta
15, 3, 4 heart stents,Coughing_ severe bruising_ nosebleeds_ hard to stop bleeding from any injury.,I hate this drug and the bruising it causes to my whole body.  Had an object fall on my arm and have a huge lump and black and blue that is not going away anytime soon.  I'm wishing I could have stayed on Plavix because even that did not cause the extent of the bruising I'm getting now.,F,68,5  months90 2X D,9/8/2013Email,Brilinta
16, 1, Doc stent in February 2013,went to ER numbness left side of body mostly face_ no Brilinta no numbness the end,took myself off and lowered Coreg to 3.125 from 6.2 (pulse was 38 to 48). will try Plavix if Doc thinks this would work better.,M,57,29  days90 2X D,3/23/2013Email,Brilinta
17, 3, I had 2 stents in my heart,I too have had a dry cough for 2 months.  I'm not sure if its related to the Drug.  It seems to have reduced my chest discomfort.  I used to take Plavix after my first stent was placed in my heart a year ago.  When my 2nd stent was placed in my heart two months ago they switched me to Brilinta.,Most of the other Doctors I see never heard of this Drug.  I understand it is a new drug but nevertheless it makes me slightly nervous taking.  But my cardiologist wants me to stay on this drug.,F,55,2  months90 MG 2X D,12/1/2012,Brilinta
18, 2, Had a stent inserted in the heart,Shortness of breath_ dry cough_ blood pressure has risen,I see my Cardiologist next week concerning these side effects.  The cough I can handle but the shortness of breath I can't (especially since I already have COPD).  Really can't blame the rise in blood pressure on this med as I'm not sure.,F,73,6  weeks40 mg 2X D,7/13/2012Email,Brilinta
