0, 5, coliltis and diarhea,No side effects.,The only bad thing I have to say about this drug is the cost. I guess I would sell anything I had to be able to afford it. It has literally saved my sanity.,F,72,10  years 1X D,7/18/2014,Lotronex
1, 4, IBS-D,No side effects other than rare constipation. If that happens I just stop for one day and all is well again.,I am male and have been taking this medicine since before it was removed from the market and jumped on it when it came back. I have suffered from chronic IBS-D since I was about 5 (I'm 52 now) and this is the only medicine I've ever had that was truly effective.  Unfortunately my new insurance coverage (Aetna) will not pay for it because I'm not female. Not sure what I'm going to do when my supply runs out.,M,52,5  years1 1X D,11/16/2011Email,Lotronex
2, 1, severe IBS-D,constipation_ slowed colon movement,I have severe IBS-D. I only took this drug for 5 days.  I couldn't go to bathroom at all.  I took medication to help me go.  I only would go a little bit.  After 6 weeks of not taking this medication_ my bowels are still not moving right. I am even having trouble just passing gas.  I also have a lot of nausea and bloating. I look like I am pregnant at times. I have an appointment with my doctor to see what is going on.  I wish I never tried this drug.,F,42,5  days1 mg 2X D,8/17/2011,Lotronex
3, 5, ibs-d,firmer stools_ no more diarrhea,Great drug_ should never have been removed from the market the first time.  I was on it then and got right back on it when it came back out.  It's not 100% but the best so far.  If I could get my doc to let me take more than 1 pill a day I would take 2 at times_ I sometimes need more than 1.,F,52,5  years1mg 1X D,6/17/2010Email,Lotronex
4, 5, IBS -- diarrhea,Minor constipation in the beginning,Lotronex is the best medication I've ever taken.  It is life changing.  I can eat anything and don't have to worry about IBS controlling my life any more.  I take 1 mg in the morning and I am fine all day.,F,34,3  years,3/31/2008,Lotronex
5, 5, Ibs-D,none,I only take .5 mg every other day and I have been living a normal life ever since. A definite must have if you suffer from IBS-D. No side effects only great results for me.,F,33,1.5  years,5/14/2007Email,Lotronex
6, 5, IBS,I can't believe more people haven't written in to rave about this drug. I have the diarrhea form of IBS (for which this medicine is intended_) and it has been a god-send.  When Glaxo pulled it from the market_ it was one of the saddest days of my life.  Fortunately_ it's back and regaining its notoriety among IBS sufferers.  The only downside is waiting the approximately 2 weeks for it to kick in.,It works so well if taken according to the instructions.  Start with the minimal dose_ and then if a second pill is needed_ add it. I have never needed a second pill per day.  One does the trick.,F,58,3  years,4/9/2006,Lotronex
7, 5, IBS-D,increased flatulence,So far_ so good!  I am starting to enjoy getting up in the morning and going out not having to worry about where the closest bathroom is.  I am .5 mg twice a day and seems to be working just fine.,F,32,2  weeks,1/29/2006,Lotronex
