2, 4, depression_ anxiety,Yes_ it's true that I've taken this medicine for over 15 years. Took a much higher dose initially (60 mg)_ but then tapered off to 10 mg/day (w/ option of 20 mg during high-stress times). It has been very effective for me--stopped or slowed down the panic attacks and increased my feelings that I could cope with my stressors. Eventually seemed to slowly help lift the black cloud surrounding me.  Few bad side effects_ except chronic constipation. Fortunately_ way less noticeable negative effect on sexual function_ unlike the SSRI's I tried initially.,,F,50,15  years10 mg 1X D,2/9/2016,Pamelor

17, 2, Spectrum Headaches,I have suffered from major depression and anxiety for a long_ long time and have been doing very well for over a year now with 200mg Zoloft 200mg Lamictal and 3mg Klonopin. I had a concussion after falling in late Sept 13 and started having daily headaches. I started seeing a neurologist for help and Pamelor was prescribed because most headache meds have caffeine or stimulants which I highly allergic to. He said that this medicine had several other uses than just treating depression. He was not at all clear enough that combining this with my Zoloft was bad news. I have horrible dry mouth_ confusion_ and lethargy. I feel like I have the flu without the UPR and vomiting. I'm not going to take it anymore.,,F,34,2  weeks25-50 MG,2/16/2014Email,Pamelor

19, 1, Depression,Rapid weight gain (~10 lbs in about 2 weeks),Haven't experienced any benefit since it has only been 2 weeks. But I am stopping now that I have connected it to insatiable appetite for carbs & sugar. Plus_ I feel even more depressed about the sudden weight gain. I was so down when it was prescribed that I forgot to ask about possible weight gain and I didn't even look this drug up on the internet until today.Well_ time to find a form of exercise....,F,39,2  weeks50 mg 1X D,12/24/2013,Pamelor
20, 5, Chronic Major Depression,Dry mouth_ sugar cravings...wt gain_ constipation_ crazy dreams with dose changes--only lasted 1-2 days.,"Pamelor (Brand name med----not generic) was the medication added to Zoloft 200mg and Wellbutrin SR 450mg that took me out of my deepest depression_ allowed me to sleep soundly and be refreshed in the am_ and just provided me the ability to function with ease and a positive sense of well being.  Unfortunately there are side effects; however I had trialed 30 + medications and various med combinations over a painful 8 year time period; Pamelor was what it took to find normalcy. (no more crying_ depressive/suicidal thoughts_ irritability or insomnia.)  Sorry to hear everyone else's experiences; but if it wasn't for this drug (part of my ""cocktail"" of 3 antidepressants)....I simply wouldn't have made it this far into my life. Age 44. As of today_ my pharmacy can no longer obtain the drug!! My back up plan with 90% effiectiveness is a compounded form of Nortriptyline (generic form of Pamelor).  Find an integrative doctor willing to prescribe ""Nortriptyline from a compound pharmacy.""  They only use the ""Nortriptyline"" ingredient and no binders within the capsule form..........it's made all the difference in the world; but nothing beats the real Pamelor.  I don't know why_ but generic meds are ineffective compared to the brand name for me. Trusting compound pharmacy I highly recommend--- Abrams Pharmacy in Texas.

21, 5, Migraines,I was originally on 100 mg but after 10 years i went to 50 mg. I was put on it for migraines when i was 4 months pregnant . I have had reduced migraines from taking pamelor. The only real side effect i had was for every 50 mg i took i gained 15-20 lbs.every time I have tried to go off of it the daily migraines have come back. It is supposed to make you tired but most meds i have an opposite effect of it so after i take it i have about 4 hours of energy. I have found to take it around 7;00 each night works best for me.,I have tried several other migraine meds to help with my migraines and this is the first one that i have not grown immune to after a period of time.I have suffered from Migraines since i was four.,F,46,20  years50 mg 1X D,11/5/2013Email,Pamelor

23, 5, Migraine prevention,Dry mouth (chewing gum helps)_ decrease in migraine frequency from 21/month to 3/month_ decrease in intensity: now manageable with Excedrine and feverfew. Hot flashes down by about 70%.  Sleep very well now so I am more focused during the day.  I exercise and eat vegetarian so weight is not a problem.,I started at 10 mg/day but not effective.  Increasing to 50 mg/day (I am 110 lbs) taken nightly has been amazing.  Pamelor also takes the edge off_ I don't feel stressed out at work and don't lose my temper anymore.  I think that this new situation where I am finally in control of my migraines has made me feel better about myself and not as helpless as I used to feel.  I highly  recommend trying it.,F,50,5  months50 mg 1X D,7/3/2013,Pamelor

28, 1, Major Depression,Irritability_ elevated heart rate (constantly over 110 bpm_) and increased suicidal thoughts,My doctor switched me to Pamelor because I was still having occasional suicidal thoughts on my old antidepressant. I became extremely irritable on Pamelor_ but the worst part was that my suicidal thoughts increased tremendously once I began the Pamelor. It got to the point where_ if I was awake_ I was thinking about dying. I had a plan in place and intended to use it. Thankfully_ my therapist got me to the hospital before I was able to carry it out. If she hadn't_ I probably wouldn't be here writing this review. Also_ the doctor in the hospital informed me that it's very easy to overdose on Pamelor and that it can be fatal. My prescribing doctor did not mention that at all.  This drug was VERY BAD for me....almost lost my life on it!,F,33,1  months50mg 1X D,12/24/2012Email,Pamelor

30, 1, Depression,I would absolutely NOT recommend this medication.  I'm appalled as to why the FDA even allows this drug. I've experienced weight gain of 10 pounds after only 3 weeks on this drug_ loss of libido and sex drive & caused me to have  mood swings where I'd be punching myself in the face.  I have trouble falling asleep at night then difficulty getting out of bed in the morning.,,M,35,3  weeks20mg,11/18/2012,Pamelor
31, 1, Anxiety/headaches,I took it for 12yrs and it helped my anxiety and headache issue like a charm however I was very over emotional during that time and quick to fly off the handle. I didnt realize this until I went off of it last year due to increase heart palipitation that began and have since stopped since going off this. I have longterm affects from this drug_ although my severe constipation i had during that time  I was on it has cleared up thank goodness I have lots of urinary and stomach problems since stopping this. I feel as though this medication and  its drying affect on the system created these over the long period of time i took them but didnt realize it due to nortriptyline being a pain receptor. However as soon as i went off of it everything hit me full force_ constant uti's_ kidney issues_ pancrease issues everything in my stomach just went to hell and a year later I am still batteling this_ Ive only had one doctor say that he thinks that because of the pain recepting propertys of this drug,,F,45,12  years10mg 1X D,10/25/2012Email,Pamelor

35, 1, Migraine,I was very drowsy but as that wore off I was very agitated and I was hearing voices in my head. My ears won't stop ringing now. I don't know if I will ever be back to normal.,This is a scary drug. Here are some of its side effects.Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth_ face_ lips_ or tongue); blurred vision or other vision changes; changes in sex drive; chest pain; confusion; constipation; fainting; fast_ slow_ or irregular heartbeat; fever; frequent or difficult urination; hallucinations; impulsive behavior or other unusual changes in behavior; jaw_ neck_ or muscle spasms; mental or mood changes (eg_ increased anxiety_ mood swings_ agitation_ irritability_ nervousness_ restlessness); panic attacks; ringing in the ears; seizures; severe dizziness or drowsiness; sore throat; stomach pain; suicidal thinking or behavior; swelling of the testicles; tremor; trouble sleeping; trouble walking or keeping your balance; twitching of the face or tongue; uncontrolled movements of arms and legs or stiffness; unusual bleeding or bruising; worsening of depression; yellowing of the skin or eyes.How could the FDA allow this poison on the market?,M,57,3  days50 1X D,6/18/2012Email,Pamelor
36, 4, Depression / Tension Headache,Intense sedation .... dizziness when standing ... light headedness .... low sperm ejaculation .... extended orgasms.,I was prescribed this for headache/chronic pain in my neck/head and major depression from having been sick for years.  This drug for me worked great_ not so much for my headaches but for the deep refreshing sleep it gave me to cope with the pain.  It also lifted my depression and gave me extended orgasms.  The only weird side effect was reduced sperm output during ejaculations.  I would probably be dead if not for Pamelor.  It really brought me out a sever depression.  I guess for some people it works on headaches_ but for me not so much.  Desipramine on the other hand works good for my headaches but ruins my sleep cycle.,M,46,10  years275mg 1X D,4/27/2012Email,Pamelor
37, 1, Anxiety/depression/insomnia,This was recently added by my doc to supplement Zoloft 200mg and Klonopin 3mg. It was supposed to help me sleep. At first it was ok_ but now I've noticed an increase in anger_ anxiety_ I'm shaky_ queasy and it has never helped me sleep the night.  I have horrible_ graphic_ vivid dreams and nightmares when I do sleep.  It has sent me in to full blown panic attack mode and I am refusing to take it anymore.,,F,30,4  weeks50mg,2/25/2012Email,Pamelor
38, 3, Neropathy Pain\NMO,PRO: Cuts pain over time and increased dosages (10mg to 75mg)CON: Rapid weight gain_ loss of strength_ water retention_ increased appetite_ poor\no erections_ loss of sex drive_ bloating_ fatigue_ very  moody when starting and stopping medication,Cuts the pain all though you won't feel/know it for some time_ as it is a gradual process. It cuts nero-pain by tweaking the sodium channels in your cells.  This causes you to hold more water and have rapid weight gain (20lbs - 30lbs).  Somehow_ the increased fluids around the nerves and muscles improves nerve conduction and lowers pain.The more I took_ the less pain and strength I had.  I went  from 240lbs to 290lbs in 3 months.  At 75mg_  I needed a lot of help_ especially getting up and down. Less strength and 50lbs heaver was hard on my wife.  I had to move to 50mg to function and later to 25mg_ as the side effects were still to  much for me. I have wined myself off completely after 1.5yrs. When you stop it causes a wicked rebound in pain for a few weeks.  It takes awhile to get through the withdraws and adjust to your old pain level.  Drink lots of water during this time_ as it helps.  I also  used Valium (PRN) and weed in the evening for pain. It did cut the pain_ second best after marijuana_ but the cost was too much and I still needed weed. I can live and function as a pot head_ but Pamelor made me a weak_ fat_ blob and I can't live like that.,M,47,18  months75 1X D,1/9/2012Email,Pamelor

When stopped first two stopped but have had progessively malfunctioning gastrointestinal system since.  Now age 52 lower GI pretty much doesn't function without  pain_ strain_ more pain.  Had no issues whatsoever with this_ perfectly normal until took Pamelor_ ever since lower GI/bowel has gotten worse and worse.

Increased appetite that i love,Pamelor so far is working amazing for me i cant believe it.  I used to get 3 or 4 headaches a day and have to drink caffeine to take them away.  i was on excedrin every day about 6 pills a day for headaches and then i quit the excedrin and got headaches everyday for 2 months.  then the doctor gave me pamelor and it started working within 2 weeks.  my life has got so much better and i can do stuff now.  im so glad this worked. i still do get little headaches sometimes but they go away pretty quick. now all i drink is a espresso with little caffeine in the morning and keeps the pressure off my head.,M,30,3  weeks50 1X D,6/24/2011Email,Pamelor

Pamelor doesn't effect my libido_ which is great_ but the anti-depression side is questionable. I have mornings when I really wonder if I'll make it through the day.

NOTHING my doctor perscribed would make them go away. Finally when I saw a neurologist he perscribed the Pamelor and four weeks later I've been completely headache free for almost a week now.

I was supposed to start at 10mg each night and increase to 100mg a day. when I reached 30mg my headaches decreased greatly_ so I stayed at 30mg/day. my mouth is very very dry all of the time & Im constantly drinking water because of it_ wake up in the middle of the night choking bc of dry mouth. no bowel movements for days which decreases my appetite_ but also gave me heartburn (which I never had before) also bc of the constipation if I went to many days without movement I would throw up bc I was so backed up. gained a little weight but kept it maintained by working out more than usual. bc it changes your hormones it fought with my birth control and would cause acne_ but did make menstration a lot better for me! the effects of this were worth it.

56, 5, Nerve Pain,I do not feel sleepy_ in fact I seem to be more energetic. It has curbed my appetite...I have lost 5 lbs already. I crave vegetables like crazy! I have dry mouth like crazy_ but if I brush and mouth wash it helps. Dry mouth is bad for your teeth and most pain meds/anti dep. cause this so up your dental care_ as it promotes bacteria to grow as there is no salivia to help wash it away! As for the pain...it has helped IMMENSLY! I seem to be a bit more emotional_ but not in a bad way.,I also take a low dose of Celexa (10 mg) which made me gain 20 lbs. over the last two years. For some reason they work well together and I have stuck a pefect balance. I am able to reduce my pain medication as not as much is needed any more. I am optimistic that the results will continue. I was very worried about weight gain as most people talked about that_ but so far I have lost 5 lbs. Also_ it has not affected my bath room habits one bit. Again_ I cannot stress enough that proper dental care is paramount when on any medication. The bacteria in your mouth gets below the gum line to cause periodantal disease. Learn from my mistake! I have to see a dental hygentist ever 3-4 mos to keep from falling out. Scary!PS The reason I am on all these meds is that I was in a terrible car accident many years ago that cause some pretty bad long term damage. I hope this helps.,F,37,7  days10 mg 1X D,10/2/2010,Pamelor
57, 3, Nerve pain from spinal cord surg,drymouth_ ringing in ears_ low sex drive (inability to ejaculate),I'm taking generic form -- nortriptylene.  It's helping the pain noticeably (though not anywhere near eliminating it) in conjunction with Gabapentin.  Trying to decide if it's worth all the side effects.,M,51,3  months75 1X D,9/28/2010,Pamelor
58, 4, depression/panic disorder,constipation_ dry mouth_ dermatitis_ rapid heartbeat,This med helped me cope with a major depression/panic disorder about 13 years ago.It was most effective for the first few years.  Gabapentin and alprazolam helped mitigate the anxiety. I stopped taking it over a year ago- It had outlived its usefulness.I mistakenly thought it contributed to a urinary problem (most likely was a separate- age related issue)  However_ the drying effects of this drug can mess with your digestive and urinary system.  All in all_ it was much more helpful than not- especially since I was terrified of ssri's after a miserable experience with zoloft.,M,60,12  years150mg 1X D,9/5/2010,Pamelor
