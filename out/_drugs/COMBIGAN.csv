0, 3, Glaucoma,Right eyelid itchy_ red_ swollen_ scabby. I thought at first it was skin cancer_ but from the comments here it seems a fairly common side effect. Not happy about this. It brings the eye pressure down_ but still ...,,F,56,2  months 2X D,7/1/2015Email,Combigan
1, 1, glaucoma,Lot#82809 is causing around eye irritation.,So far only Lot#82809 is causing the problem.  Reminds me of B&L contact lens wash problems of many years ago.  I cannot contact Allergan directly.,M,75,8  months0.20/0.5% 2X D,4/11/2014Email,Combigan
2, 1, Glaucoma,Swollen_ itching and cracking skin around eyes_ inflamed and swollen tear ducts_ inflamed eyes.   All symptoms stopped  within one week after halting Combigan.,"Combigan did reduce eye pressure beyond what Lumigan did_ but I had a reaction to something in the Combigan.  This reaction is mentioned as being of low likelihood in the enclosure.  ""Rare"" does not mean ""Never""!",M,76,8  months0.2 /0.5 1X D,5/3/2013,Combigan

6, 1, Glaucoma,After 15mnths developed red eyes_ itching eyelid margins_ tear ducts and other areas around the eye_ particularly below the eye where the skin became red and raw.,Caused Uveitis and Iritis which are being treated with steroid and dilatory drops which in turn are raising the eye pressures and the replacement (preservative-free) Cosopt drops are not strong enough to counteract this. Will probably end up needing surgery.,M,66,2  years 2X D,10/14/2010Email,Combigan
7, 3, temporary use to lower pressure,Dry mouth_ bad taste in mouth_ feel a bit tired.  Am getting some palpitations but not too serious as a deliberate cough or two stops them.  I was a chronic A-Fibber for 10 years before surgical cure (mini-maze surgery 4 years ago)_ so am quite familiar with heart palpitations.,I am only taking this temporarily in one eye after cateract surgery because corticosteroid drops caused high ocular pressure.  Would not want to take Combigan long term.,M,65,7  daysDrop 2X D,10/4/2010Email,Combigan
8, 1, glaucoma,I am exhausted almost immediately upon administering the drops.  I feel drained_ lethargic_ no energy at all.,I took Combigan 2 weeks ago for 2 days_ felt exhausted_ gloomy_ so I stopped the drops and felt great once again.  I waited 2 weeks_ tried again_ and immediately felt drained_ just like before.  I also take Xalatan with no ill effects.  I will continue with that and substitute Dorzolomide for Combigan.  I have 3 children_ so I can't sleep all day_ I need my energy back.,F,52,2  days 2X D,2/3/2010,Combigan
9, 4, high IOP,Puts me to sleep immediately_ so I take it right before bedtime.,Been on it 2 years and only now have been experiencing redness in one of my eyes only. Stopped the drops in that eye only and redness goes away. Until now I've had no problems with it.,F,40,2  years,12/23/2009,Combigan
