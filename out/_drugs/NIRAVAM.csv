0, 5, Extreme Panic Attacks and High Anxi,I have taken generic Xanax and it tastes horrible when I put it under my tongue and last up to a few hours that nasty after taste. Brand Xanax won't melt until a good 5 minutes. Plus both brand and generic Xanax gave me anxiety before the medication kicked in up to 30 to 45 minutes later. Niravam what a different animal all together!! I love this Xanax!! Tastes awesome_ melts in 5 seconds and works so damn fast! Kicks panic to the curb unlike the other Xanax No wonder this drug is so expensive but worth it believe me. Never again will I go back to regular Xanax brand or not.,,M,44,2  months1.0mg,12/4/2015Email,Niravam
