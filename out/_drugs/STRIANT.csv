0, 1, Hypogonadism,I don't think this lower (10 hrs a night) brought up my T levels by any significant degree. No side effects_ good or bad,Even with the tab properly placed_ it turned into a waxy paste within several hours. You can't eat with it in. It would soften into a paste overnight,M,53,30  days30mg 10 hr 1X D,12/18/2014Email,Striant
1, 1, secondary hypogonadism,impossible to continue using this drug! You are constantly aware of the tablet between your lip & gum_ its like having a bit of food stuck there! It would drive anyone mad! It also turns to a sticky mush if it does ( occasionally)stick in the correct place. more often that not it will not stick & ends up in an even more irritating place in your mouth!,Obviously very poor research done on real people before this system was marketed!If it was designed as a thin film to stick to the roof of the mouth like those breath fresheners it just might be successful. As it is_ I would expect the manufacturer to go bust!,M,55,10  days30mg 2X D,11/6/2010Email,Striant
