0, 5, Bronchial infection,took this for a bad bronchial infection. Ran 102 fever for 3 days. 1st dose_ diarrhea all day. Subsided 2nd day. No side effects whatsoever once diarrhea ran its course.,My fever broke 4 hours after the 1st dose. Was very thankful this drug worked effectively for me. I hate taking antibiotics but this one actually worked. Make sure you have an electrolyte to drink (gatorade_ etc)and a high quality probiotic if taking this.,M,35,10  days200mg 1X D,2/13/2012Email,Spectracef
