0, 1, Colonoscopy,Chills_ nausea_ bloating_ stomach pain,Vile stuff!  I used the flavor packet but it was no help.  Chewed gum after each 8 oz. dose.  Gagged constantly_ had two episodes of projectile vomitting.  Managed to get down most of four liters.  It worked after two hours_ but continued to work all night_ so no sleep.  Dry heaved all morning...NEVER TAKE THIS STUFF...IF YOUR DOCTOR INSISTS GET A NEW DOCTOR.,F,65,  1X D,11/17/2015,Colyte
1, 4, Colonoscopy prep,"It worked as promised_ but I simply cannot drink the prescribed amount of liquid. My first ""dose"" was to be 1/2 of the jug in one hour. I gagged down half that_ chewing a fresh piece of peppermint gum just before each cup. I held my nose_ used a straw_ and did the best I could. I dread my next session beginning at 3 am. This is my third colonoscopy in nine years with the same doctor_ and he used a pill/liquid combo in the past_ and I always was completely clean for the procedure. If he continues this barbaric type of prep_ he'll not see me for my fourth procedure. I'll find a doctor who is more humane.",Nasty tasting even with the so-called flavoring but effective. The required amount to consume is beyond realistic. If your doctor uses this type of prep_ find a new one fast!,F,65,1  days4 liters,8/24/2015,Colyte
2, 4, Colonoscopy Prep,"DISGUSTING TASTE. Extreme bloating and nauseating ""fullness"".","Absolutely disgusting. Tastes like metallic salt water--only thicker. Even reminded me of the taste of blood when I've had nosebleeds.  Extremely difficult to get down_ in other words. The first liter I downed in the ""every ten minute"" increments_ but the rest I could only bear every 45 minutes to an hour -- even THEN I was on the verge of crying and vomiting. This feeling was made worse when my mom told me about a pill form version. WHHHHYY wasn't I prescribed the pills!?!Works fast (within an hour after the first 16 oz)_ that's about the ONLY positive characteristic.",F,38,1  days4 Liters,4/9/2015,Colyte
3, 4, Colonoscopy prep,Nothing,"From experience I knew to eat soft foods two days before prep. Then all liquids the day before. Started the Colyte at 530am. After 1/2 bottle (2L) I was already clean. As usual I will tell everyone at the hospital I drank the whole bottle but I ""ain't gonna drink no more"" (excuse the bad English)",M,69,1  days4 L 1X D,8/8/2012,Colyte
4, 3, Colonoscopy Prep,Laxative,Fortunately it did not cause cramping.  I did mix Crystal Light lemonade mix in it so it made it more palatable_ but after drinking so many liters_ it got to be way too much.  I drank the first 2 liters in about 1-1/2 hours_ and the laxative started working after about 1 hour 20 minutes.  I drank the last 2 liters in about 2 hours.  It continued to work throughout the night_ so I got very little sleep.  I found out that I should have drunk a LOT of water after the 2nd liter_ to clear out the Colyte.  This was supposed to be prep that caused the least damage to kidneys.,M,52,1  days4 liters 1X AN,3/16/2010,Colyte
5, 1, Colonoscopy prep,"Horrible migrane type headache_ nausea.  Worked fast_ 1 hour.  Found it impossible to drink whole 4 liters.  I am a small woman_ 5""_ 105lbs.  No way to ingest that much liquid.  I almost feel toxic from having ingested it.  Horrible stuff!!!!!",I would not recommend this to my worst enemy.  I have had the phospho-soda before and that was much less to drink and had better effect.,F,46,1  days,7/22/2006,Colyte
6, 4, prep,took 3 hours to take effect.  It was the unflavored Colyte.  First 1/3 of the jug was ok_ then started gag reflex each gulp.  A straw helped with that.  but 3/4 done and no results.  After laying down a bit things started.  The last 4 cups were ok.,seemed to work.  I used some sort of powder in a lot less water last time_ worked as well without that whole gallon of fluid.,F,51, ,6/7/2006,Colyte
