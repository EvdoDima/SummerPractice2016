0, 1, Nasal allergies,I never have side effects to meds. After on this for a few days I became so exhausted I could barely function. I would nap any chance I got. Also would wake up sometimes with a pounding heart. The drug didn't even help my allergies. a few days after stopping I was back to normal again.  Totally not worth the side effects.,,M,39,2  weeks2 sprays/d,5/6/2015,Astepro
1, 5, sinusitis_ allergies,bad taste running down throat_ big deal.lol.A little burning here and there_ tiredness,I will definitely continue taking this spray_it has helped me a great deal to not feel so miserable! and also want to add_ for those that it dries out your nose_ buy ocean saline spray at any drug store to keep the nasal passages moist.HELPS!,,45,3  weeks1 spray ea 1X D,2/20/2014Email,Astepro
2, 2, Sinusitis,I seemed to become much more sensitive to Astepro after I had Shingles last spring. In addition the air is very dry now because I live in CT. Now the burning in and under my nostrils after I use this is practically unbearable. In addition_ it creates a mixture of dried blood and dried mucus that coats the inside of my nose and lasts for a few days. Very uncomfortable.,I am not going to use Astepro again. When I don't use it_ I can actually blow my nose and have normal mucous flow with no blood in it.,F,57,3  years.15 1X D,2/3/2014Email,Astepro
3, 1, allergies and asthma,Nosebleeds serious enough to send me to the ER and to an ENT doctor for cauterization and packing.  I have rarely had nosebleeds but today I ended up in the ER because I could not get the nosebleed to stop and was spitting up huge clots.  Had another after I returned home and my PCP sent me to an ENT doctor who packed my nose and then had to cauterize it.,I think I would rather live with my allergies.,F,56,3  months0.15% 2X D,8/21/2013,Astepro
4, 1, Allergies,After having taken Astepro for many months_ stopping b/c of the seasons_ and then restarting_ I began having horrible acid reflux.  After months of taking different medicines_ seeing specialists_ and getting pH tested_ I found out it was the Astepro causing irritation in my esophagus.,,M,32,6  months 2X D,3/4/2013,Astepro
5, 3, rhinitis,Kidney issues. When I went in for routine blood work_ my creatinine (blood protein) was 1.8 (34% kidney function)_ and that is too high. It indicates that the kidneys are not functioning properly. I quit Astepro_ and a week later my creatinine was .6 (107% kidney function). I also had urinary burning_ but there was no indication of infection in my blood. But there was some blood in my urine while I was taking Astepro. That cleared up when I quit taking it.,Although Astepro did help clear my stuffy nose_ I absolutely recommend AGAINST taking it. I was taking it in conjunction with Nasacort_ as recommend by my ENT doc. My dosage of Astepro was 2 puffs in each nostril 2x per day_ for a total of 8 puffs. I don't know if it increased my body pains; I have osteoarthritis and have chronic pain anyway. It does taste bad.,M,45,12  months4 puffs 2x 2X D,6/2/2012Email,Astepro
6, 3, sinusitis,sleepy_ mentally impaired.,While taking the prescribed dose_ I lost my purse and a few days later forgot to go to work. It changed my behavior so I reduced the dose. I won't stay on it because I need to be more alert.,F,59,7  days.15 2X D,5/27/2012Email,Astepro
7, 5, allergies/constant post-nasal drip,mild headaches and some fatigue,Have tried more than a dozen allergy meds and allergy shots_ this is the first medication to help.,M,54,20  days 2X D,3/22/2012Email,Astepro
8, 3, allergic rhinitis,Terrible burning itchiness inside my nose. Did not sneeze_ but sure felt like sneezing would have been a relief. The acute itchiness lasted ten or fifteen minutes_ and then significantly reduced but did not go away. Also_ the taste isn't good_ but that didn't bother me all that much.,This is only my second day on this med_ but so far I am unhappy with it. I called the doctor's office_ and told them that I felt itchy inside my nose_ like I had never felt before_ and the nurse told me it was just allergic rhinitis. Nothing I could say to her could get her to understand that this was different_ but I didn't realize that it was definitely a side effect from the med until the third time I took it. Now_ I'm certain.,F,48,2  days.15 x2 2X D,2/17/2012Email,Astepro
9, 4, Allergies,This medicine really stopped my sneezing and helped out with nasal allergies and the fatigue caused by them.  However_ it contains sucralose_ which can be a trigger for migraines and GI problems and possible Thymus Gland issues.  See www.livestrong.com/article/85719-dangers-sucralose/.,I don't feel comfortable taking this drug consistently because of the sucralose it contains.

10, 1, Nasal Allergies,Very dry sinuses that caused lots of blood in my mucus.,It did nothing to help my allergies. It only made my nose bleed. I don't recommend this at all.,F,31,1  weeks2 sprays 2X D,10/13/2011,Astepro
11, 4, allergies/sinus problems; migraines,Sleepiness. It gives me a good night's sleep for the first time in a long time_ but I'm considering reducing or skipping the morning dose.,Allegra D gave me some relief from allergy symptoms but didn't stop the sinus pressure that was contributing to chronic daily migraine headaches.  Astepro has given me relief from that sinus pressure and I've gone three days without a migraine!  That's a record for me in recent years_ so I'm beyond happy with Astepro so far (except for falling asleep in the day time!),F,60,3  days1-2 sprays 2X D,10/7/2011,Astepro
12, 3, Vasomotrr/Mixed Rhinitis,One major thing that happens is I get REALLY bad sneazing fits when I reintroduce this medicine into my body_ and especially for the first couple days taking it for the first time. To me_ that meant that maybe something was working. The sneazing fits are down right scary since they get the heart rate going and last for a couple minutes. I can't tell if the dry throat that I am experiencing due to the medication or if I wasn't on it that things would be much worse. I am a singer_ and dry throat is bad_ but at least I could sing at 60%_ as before using this product I could barely speak.,I can't tell with absolute certainty that this has completely helped me since it's too soon_ but one thing is for sure is that it deffinately helped me in general. It dosent seem people know too much about Vasomotor Rhinitis_ but most Dr's love to misdiagnose it. They will just think you have alergies_ when in reality_ your nose is so sensitive_ you get bad sinus headaches at any chance in temperature or humidity. I'm happy to know at least what I have so that I could begin treatment and from all the worthless nasanex_ nasacort_ flonaise_ alegra_ etc...this medication actually did yeild some results. If you are like me and have bad sinus issues and don't just have alergies I reccomend taking Sinus Buster for the sinus headaches. I tried treating my self on Sinus Buster alone_ but then my sinuses totally kicked my but and I needed to step up to Asterpro_ which deffinately helped. Again_ I'm not totally cured just yet_ but maybe I need more time. At least I know something is working for my condition_ if only a little bit. Singing is my life_ and I'm desparate at this point_ and this does help a little.,M,31,1.5  weeks1.5 1X D,5/21/2011Email,Astepro
13, 4, chronic sinusitis,I'm not sure if this is a side effect.  That is why I'm asking.  I normally do not have even pink cheeks but my cheeks are brilliant red after using this only once.  Has anyone else experienced this?,,F,57,1  days205.5 mcg 2X D,5/6/2011,Astepro
14, 5, sinus headaches_ postnasal drip,Some stomach ache_ kind of like heartburn_ but nearer my belly button. Slept well_ but had wild dreams_ like being chased by a horse-sized hamster_ all night. I was a little dizzy yesterday_ but just quit taking Claritin D 2 days ago_ which always keeps me up all night long with racing thoughts and pounding heart_ so it might have just been lack of sleep catching up with me. It CAN leave a gross taste in your mouth if you take it incorrectly_ so it is VERY important that you take it right_ because the taste is nasty and doesn't go away for hours. MAKE SURE your head is tilted forward while you're standing up_ with your chin to your chest_ looking down at your toes. Sniff GENTLY as you QUICKLY push the plunger down (aim it at the back side of your nose). This will create a mist that mostly goes into your nasal cavity. If you push slowly_ you'll get a stream of liquid that runs down your throat into your mouth_ and if you don't look down (so medicine can settle into your sinuses instead,I will post later when I've had more time on this medicine_ but after 3 days_ I think it is a miracle. For the first time in MONTHS_ I have no hint of sinus headache_ and it has almost cleared up my year-round case of post nasal drip. No more disgusting hacking and snorting just to clear my throat to breathe!!! I only take half the recommended dose_ because this medicine is similar to astelin_ and since Claritin makes my heart race and most of the negative comments regarding astelin talk about heart racing_ I didn't want to deal with that. Taking one squirt of the 1.5 mg spray up each nostril once a day hasn't caused any of that_ and did relieve the pressure in my head and ears. I feel like an entirely new person_ and am just hoping that some of the side effects I have read about Astelin are not going to happen. However_ I feel so much better that even if I did have side effects_ I would consider taking it_ even if not every day.,F,36,3  days1.5 1X D,9/16/2010,Astepro
15, 5, Post nasal drip,Only bad taste!,Worked very well to stop post nasal drip.  I use it along with nasonex and zyrtec and while taking allergy shots.  It works within 30 minutes and is great!,F,36,3  months.15 1X D,8/20/2010,Astepro
16, 5, allergies,Bad taste_ stange smells,Well worth any side effects. I had been on XZAL and NASACORT for two weeks and allergies were no better. Could tell an amazing difference after 3 doses of Astepro.,F,44,7  days.15 2X D,5/11/2010Email,Astepro
