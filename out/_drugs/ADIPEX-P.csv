0, 5, weight loss,Amazing!!! I lost 65 pounds...18 of them being the firat month on adipex. Dry mouth def._ my heart would race and you just have to sit down and remember and make sure not to OVER-DO yourself. My appetite was extremely curved- My mom went and got on it and had no effect at all_ she was disappointed but everyone's different. It is worth a try!  It works for most that I have seen_ but there are a few that see no results or side effects.,,F,25,4  months37.5,4/16/2015,Adipex-p
1, 4, Weight loss,Dry mouth_ constipation. After the 3rd time I took it I did not get energy like I did the first time I was on it! and caused me to get cystic acne.  My weight loss was great the first time I took it 174 down to 130lbs! I weaned of the meds( some withdraw )  over year and a half gained about 30lbs back! Started meds again and noticed my face began to break out and did not have energy liked I did in past! Although It still curved my appetite!  Thinking watching what I eat on my own is going to be my future route!,,F,29,3  years,9/21/2014Email,Adipex-p
2, 5, Control Appetite/Lose weight,Severe constipation_ restlessness_ and severe itching.  At times I would not have the urge to go for days and have to use an enema to induce bowel movement.  The itching is the worst. It happens on my thighs_ belly_ and under arms the most.  I itch many bruises into my skin because it is so bad and I cant stop.,I have taken this on and off for about 3 years.  The side effects have changed over time.  I do not have as much constipation_ but the itching came about with my most recent restart of the meds.,F,34,3  years30 mg 1X D,7/31/2014,Adipex-p

5, 3, Weight Loss,No Side Effects,Well_ my doc prescribed 37.5 1 x day last week to aid in weight loss. He said it would increase my metabolism (don't see where the label says that) and decrease appetite. I haven't noticed a single change and my weight has gone up 3lbs in this week like it's been doing for months. I have gone from 110 to 146 in just  few months. I have been vegetarian for 20 years and even started Weight Watchers again back in October. It worked before to get 40lbs off fast and my weight is still going up this go round. It's highly unusual. Am I not responding to this medicine because I do not have enough weight to lose? I think it's only 30lbs to lose and maybe I wont respond. I have felt exactly the same_ perhaps MORE hungry! Please someone email me if they have knowledge or advise! Erica_spain@hotmail.com,F,31,8  days37.5 1X D,2/26/2013Email,Adipex-p
6, 4, Weight loss,I experienced severe mood swings and anxiety while on this medication. My heart felt as though it were racing_ and I sometimes had trouble sleeping. The side effects_ however_ were worth it for me_ because I ultimately lost 90 pounds on this medication.,Side effects are extremely unpleasant. Anxiety_ racing heart_ insomnia_ mood swings_ euphoria_ dry mouth_ and a bad taste in mouth were the most common. Luckily this medicine isn't used for long-term and it is EXTREMELY effective in helping with weight loss. I lost about 20 pounds per month on average.,F,20,4  months37.5mg 1X D,12/6/2012,Adipex-p
7, 4, Weight Loss,Was unable to sleep when first started taking it_ possible stomach upset at times_ temperature changes (go hot and then cold easier than usual).,I started off taking the generic (phentermine) 37.5MG_ and due to this not working as well as it should_ my doctor increased to 37.5MG in the morning_ and then 18.75mg at lunch (half a pill).  It works very well for me.  I have no appetite_ lots of energy_ and generally feel pretty good.  I've lost over 50 pounds taking this medication. I have never taken the brand name_ so I can't speculate as to the differences between the brand name and the generic.,M,30,2.5  months37.5 1X D,3/10/2012,Adipex-p
8, 5, Weight Loss,Dry Month_ Insomnia_ Constipation - Increased symptoms of Existing Anemia Condition.,I'm taking Adipex/Phentermine in combo with Medically guided Nutritional Counseling. I've lost 35 lbs. in nearly 7 months (203 down to 168.  I have noticed its decrease in effectiveness after about 4 months. The key here is to adjust your diet and vitamin supplements. i.e. protein shakes_ lemon water(natural diuretic) B-12 shots AND B Vitamin supplements.  I am anemic and iron supplements were a must for me.  Bulk fiber and careful diet are a must with the already added constipation side effect.Bottom Line - My obesity was far more damaging to my overall health and well-being than these short-term side effects.,F,31,7  months37.5 1X D,10/30/2010,Adipex-p
9, 5, Phentermine,Dry Mouth_ Feeling Hot_ Increased Heart rate when I worked out_ Increased Energy_ Increase libido!,I love it! I take it first thing in the morning so this way I could sleep at night. I have increased energy at work. I don't feel tired all day. To conquor dry mouth I drank lots of water and had gum handy. When I was feeling hot I used my AC or fan. The only thing was when I worked out my heart rate would jump from 127 to 180. I had to take it slow at the gym to get the full effect but I had so much energy and I sweated for the first time working out. Plus I loved the energy while having sex. When my husband took it was even better!,F,33,2  months30 mg 1X D,8/14/2010,Adipex-p
10, 5, Weight Loss,Severe Dry mouth_ Insomnia_ Increased Sex drive_ little to no appetite.,I lost 35 pounds in 2 months with moderate exercise and a low fat_ high fiber_ low calorie (1000 calories a day) diet. I am currently in my 3rd and final month of this drug and the weight loss is slower the third month_ (my doctor states that this medication only works for 2 to 3 months at a time and use needs to stop after the third month.) He also says you must stop taking it for 6 months before you begin again (if it is still needed.) You can become addicted to it if taken too long. I am extremely happy with the results. A friend has been off of it for a year now and has even lost a few more pounds. You must continue a healthy life style to keep the weight off.,F,33,3  months37.5 mg 1X D,5/5/2010,Adipex-p
11, 5, weight loss,in the first week I couldn't sleep well at night but that wore off.  I cut the pill in 3's and only take that amount at around 3pm( since my craving are worse at night) and continue that until I feel I need to move to a half pill.  Doing it this way will not make you feel like you're gonna drop out of your own skin when you first start taking it and makes adipex last longer for you since it's known that your body adapts to it and it stops working after awhile.,This is a great medicine to drop start a weight loss program.  It takes away craving and hunger a ton and lets you get used to eating small meals thus shrinking your stomach so once you go off of it_ you are somewhat used to eating that way.  It's not addicting but Ween yourself off so you get used to eating good without it. It also gives you some energy and working out soon after you take it increases it's effects and will make you work out way longer or better!  Dry mouth is the main side effect I got and I just chew gum and drink tons of water!  This drug motivates you and even if you have a job or go to school it makes you way more alert!  It's awesome!  The best there is out there no doubt!  I went from 195 after having a baby_ down to 134!,F,26,6  months37.5 mg 1X D,2/26/2010Email,Adipex-p
12, 4, Weight loss,dry mouth_ withdrawal was very bad,I was taking this medication for 6 months and lost 30lbs. It worked great. I had a lot of energy and generally felt good. The only thing was that I stopped the medication_ because I could not make it back to my regular doctor's office and the withdrawal was absolutely horrible. I had paranoid episodes_ severe depression and anxiety and gained back 20lbs in 2 months. If you do come off this medication make sure you ween yourself off. It was entirely my fault that I went through this withdrawal and I just want to warm anyone who takes this that they need to come off of it under their doctor's supervision.,F,26,6  months,12/15/2009,Adipex-p
13, 5, Weight loss,Loss/lack of appetite,I love this medicine.  In 3 months_ with out doing 1 bit of exercise_ I lost 22lbs.  I know if I would have walked a couple of days a week or some little bit of exercise_ I would have lost more weight_ but I think that's pretty good for not doing anything.,F,22,5  months,12/13/2009,Adipex-p

I have lost 20 of those in just a little over two months! Am dealing with the severe mouth problems_ as I see the finish line. A word of advice....for your first few days....take only half a tablet! As the weeks progress_ supplementing your morning dosage with a second pill around 2 pm will keep you on track.,F,43,10  weeks,6/5/2009Email,Adipex-p
16, 3, to lose weight,It made me edgy and irritable.  I did lose weight (about 5 lbs.) without doing anything.  But I couldn't handle the side effects.  I had trouble sleeping and felt depressed and moody.  I quit taking it after about three weeks.  I like Tenuate much better!,,F,35,21  days,5/12/2009,Adipex-p
17, 3, weight loss,Hair loss_ anxiety_ irritability_ anger_ acne_ hypertension.,I loved adipex_ i hated the side effects. adipex helped me to drop 20 lbs very quickly. i could still eat but it must have raised my metabolism so much that i was dropping weight no matter what i consumed.  I had to stop taking it because I started to lose my hair_ started breaking out_ developed high blood pressure and became very angry and irritable.  If i didn't have so many side effects_ i would still be on it today. oh and of course_ once i stopped taking it I gained weight back immediately.,F,33,6  months,4/16/2009,Adipex-p

Usually I would take it for 3-4 weeks at a time (fear of addiction after reading up on it lol)PLUS I would notice it would start to lose effects after a few weeks to.I did pretty well on it.

20, 5, Weight loss,,"Another thing I gotta note. THIS ISNT a med for ""vanity"" weight. You MUST be over weight to morbid obese for this pill to work. In the beginning I lost FAST. But the closer I got to my ""medical"" proper weight it almost didn't do crap lol. Ive noticed in the ppl that say it don't work are not that much over weight or are basically losing vanity weight. Id say at least be 40 lbs over weight before trying this med.",F,31,6  months,1/27/2009Email,Adipex-p

I had gastric bypass in 1999 and after a pregnancy and gaining 58 lbs_ I could not get the weight off. Phentermine helps me not gain anymore weight. I have not seen a major decrease in weight loss.,F,38,1  years,12/29/2008,Adipex-p
22, 4, ,headaches_ decreased appetite_ sensitivity to light_ feeling wired_ short term memory loss_ irritability sometimes extreme_ feeling anxious_ nausea and vomiting,I was on this med for a little less than a year and it worked wonders.  I stated out at 15 which was too low_ moved up to 30 mg which worked great for months and then moved up to 37.5.  After moving up to 37.5 I noticed most of the side effects like the irritability_ nausea_ memory loss wired feeling and anxiousness.  This med only works for 2 weeks and then stops.  Then you have to stop taking it for a couple of days and start back up again.  I lost over 40 pounds and after stopping the med_ I am starting to gain weight back.  I tried to take it again in June and I started having rapid heartbeats and panic attacks.  I don't know if I can attribute the effects to this med_ but I have not taken it again since. My sister took this med and it made her irritable and anxious too and she stopped taking it. My sister and I both lost a tremendous amount of weight on it. I like what it did for me when I was taking it initially_ and it does work_ but I caution everyone to be careful.,F,28,11  months,11/21/2008,Adipex-p

Dry mouth_ occasional insomnia.",Ive lost 20 pounds in 2 months on this medicine. I take one pill in the morning and generally have a lack of hunger most of the day. I make myself eat breakfast_ lunch_ dinner...because meds seem to wear off alittle bit during the late evening and on an empty stomach had the urge to snack. Learned that drinking something (milk_ tea) seemed to curb the snacking urges at night.Ive had good results on this med_ would recommend only taking a one pill daily dose though_ dont let your Dr. up your dose_ if its not working with one pill... its not going to work for you_ try something else.,F,28,2  months,1/4/2007Email,Adipex-p
31, 1, weight loss,Chronic dry mouth_ racing heart_ shakes_ dizziness_ insomnia_ poor circulation_ back aches_ headaches_ racing thoughts_ mania_ heart palpitations,I have taken this drug off and on for the past 10 years for weight loss. It works_ but the results NEVER last_ it makes you feel great for about 6 months_ you loose weight_ you have awesome energy to work out and then it begins to not work anymore.  Its like you build up an immunity to it or something. I first took it in college under a dr's supervision along with Phenfluramine (sp?) as a part of the phen/phen diet.  I lost 40lbs. but eventually gained it all back plus 20lbs. I took it again 4 years after that and again lost 40 lbs._ but this time I became addicted to it and tried to take 2 or 3 pills a day when it began wearing off.  I eventually stopped taking it (after visiting the emergency room twice at 3am because I thought I was having a heart attack) and then gained all my weight back plus 40lbs.  Just stay away from this medication_ it isn't worth it!,F,31,10  years,4/4/2006,Adipex-p
32, 5, Weight Loss,Dry Mouth_ lots of energy.,Adipex is unlike anything I've ever taken to lose weight. I have tried every pill out there and they ALL made me feel sick_ gave me heart palpitations and headaches. That is NOT the case with Adipex. I took 1 pill in the morning_ and about 30 minutes later I feel happy and energetic. It takes away food cravings (I don't eat sweets at all anymore)_ and does not make me feel sick or manic at all. I lost 20 pounds in 2 months_ and have kept it off for a month. After I saw the dramatic weight loss_ I was motivated to keep it off_ so with proper nutrition and excercise this is GREAT!

I made a decision that if I went on this drug I would also exercise and control my diet. also I found a doctor that didnt simply give me the higest does but adjusted it for my needs. if your on the right dose your heart doesnt race and the side effects are minimal. I think this is a great drug combined with food control _ and exercise! with the right dose.  Once again I have to point out that YOU WILL GAIN THE WEIGHT BACK if you dont exercise and change your  eating habits and mind set.. I was on and off this drug for a while until I got the whole lifestyle change through my head.
