9, 1, Tooth infection,Within 12 hours I was suffering heart palpitations_ chest pain_ stomach and abdomen cramping and diarrhoea_ which increased in severity. My heart started to thump and then felt as if it was being rapidly turned over in my chest.  On 4th day it was missing beats every 8 seconds or so_ as confirmed on a hospital Emergency Room ECG.  ?	Chest pains over the central sternum area.  These symptoms relating to the heart and chest caused me much concern_ as I have high blood pressure and was under the care of a Cardiologist in another city I had just moved from.?	My stools had a reddish tinge_ presumably from intestinal/bowel bleeding.?	Clamminess_ shivering_ feeling of fever?	Rapid heart rate.?	Shortness of breath.?	Headaches_ behind the eyes and centre forehead.?	Gritty feeling in my eyes.?	Tremor in hands and fingers.?	Sudden appearance of a red rash on my lower arms.?	Weakness_ fatigue_ had to stay in bed almost,Our intestines have NO protection against these increasingly over-powerful drugs. Some create almost identical symptoms to poisoning_ as with Clindamycin (Neocin). I took just 4 days? dosage of this and had to be admitted to Emergency 3 times in a week_ and experienced it raging through my intestines_ liver_ kidneys in an almost identical pattern as was caused by a redback spider bite a few years ago! Each organ it attacked gave symptoms of pain_ malfunction_ and my liver felt as if it was going to burst. I think this was the liver trying with all its might to rid my body of this drug. DEADLY. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. It is not a Penicillin_ but something entirely evil as far as I have experienced. I had this given to me by a dentist after I specifically told him I wanted only Penicillin as it has always given me safe healing throughout my 69 years of life. He deceptively ?tried? this ?new antibiotic? (Clindaymycin) and told me nothing. Within 48 hours I was experiencing the worst symptoms I have ever had in my life after taking medication_ and lived in fear of it having caused clostridium dif._ which is known to have caused death. There are entire websites recording the devastating effects of this ?medication?_ and giving details of 95% of people having been caused similar agonising symptoms_ and even being admitted to ICU with their bodies shutting down to death.

I actually began to dream when lying awake_ all the while experiencing very hard involuntary jerks and twitches that would cause me to start gasping for breath. I never fell asleep.  This went on for hours after taking my second dose of 150mg and finally fell asleep from exhaustion around 4 a.m.  Lost perception of reality to an extent_ almost like I was on a bad high from a recreational drug.

22, 2, Tooth Infection,SEVERE SEVERE Indescribable heartburn,I have a tooth infection & so have been having difficulties swallowing. I went to take a capsule & I felt it get caught mid way down. I took it w a great deal of water & even ate a little something to aide in it going down. About 10 minutes later_to describe it as heartburn just does not come close to explaining the excruciating pain that came_ I thought I was dying of a heart attack or that acid was coming up & out & was burning right through all the soft tissue in my throat.It has been 3 hours & after handfuls of TUMS & other Antacids_ along with gallons of water_ I am STILL in a great deal of pain. I constantly feel the need to vomit but nothing comes up_ I have just been dry heaving. It is the one of the worst things I have ever felt in my life & that's saying a lot_ it feels like I have something lodged all throughout the entire length of my esophagus down into my stomach. Been through multiple major surgeries_ several tooth abscesses_chemo for cancer_ etc.THIS was by FAR one of the worst things I have experienced. Having such a dangerous powder within a gel capsule_ one that can easily get stuck & begin to dissolve in an area of the body that it is not made to be in_ can cause severe burns & other painful issues. I have heard horrific stories in where this has caused acute harm to people.

23, 1, Tooth pain/broken tooth,Here is a FYI!!   Be careful with Clindamycin Mine got caught in my throat yesterday_ which lead to me gagging and vomiting. It exploded and the medicine got into my sinus cavity and attached to my uvula ( hangy thing in the back of your throat) which then swelled up to 5 times the normal size. Everything in my head region got burnt by the meds.  My throat_ sinus wall_ mouth_ everything.  Due to that I could not talk or breath correctly.  If I could post the pictures you would not believe it. The doctors have not seen anything like it before.  So I was given some shots and new meds to get rid of the swelling. But she said it could take days for the burnt areas in my body to get back to normal.  This was the only time in my life I was actually thinking I was going to die.  It was the worst pain ever. Have to go back to the doctors today. So now I am paying copays_  gas to go back-and-forth my doctors and who knows how many days of work I'm going to be missing.. Not to mention I can barely swallow which means I have not ate in two days.  Prior to this I got extreme diarrhea_ and headaches which I saw on the side effects that they could be possible,,F,40,8  days300 mg,4/7/2016,Clindamycin hcl

51, 2, Abscessed tooth,I've had pneumonia in the past.  It felt exactly like being on this drug feels.  Part of that feeling is probably due to the infection itself.  No specific side effects other than feeling like walking death.,Clindamycin took care of the infection in a similar way that chemo fights cancer.  You pay the price either way.  I hope I never have to take it again but I would if I had no other choice.,M,62,7  days300mg 4X D,11/6/2015Email,Clindamycin hcl
52, 1, Tooth extraction & infection,Diarrhea_ stomach cramps/pain_ fever_ nausea.,Symptoms/side effects did not occur until two weeks after taking this medication. At first_ I developed a fever_ aches_ and chills. My fever reached 103.6 and was began to experience awful stomach pains and watery diarrhea. I went to the emergency room. An IV drip was needed for dehydration as well as strong doses of Tylenol and Motrin. It took 10 hours for fever to come down. ASK QUESTIONS WHEN TAKING THIS MEDICATION!!! I was only told to eat yogurt or take a chewable probiotic to prevent a yeast infection. I was never warned about the horrible stomach/digestive issues. After the hospital_ I immediately went to my GP who put me on Flagyl because I tested positive for C-Diff.,F,30,7  days 4X D,11/6/2015Email,Clindamycin hcl

54, 4, Root Canal Infection,Had complications with a root canal. This antibiotics is very hard on the intestines_ but I took it with Flagyl which counters that symptom. Still_ it causes significant diarrhea_ bloating and general malaise. At 150mg it did nothing_ but 450mg did the job.,This is a tough antibiotic to take_ but it did rid me of a low grade fever and knocked out a deep infection from a poorly executed root canal (3 months earlier). No headaches_ but I had a weird sense of being out of myself! But I did work and functioned_ though spent more time in front of the TV than usual. I'll update after a week or so after stopping (yesterday).,F,,3  weeks450 3X D,10/23/2015,Clindamycin hcl
55, 1, Acute Sinus Infection,On Day 3_ the diarrhea started . Not too bad_ but 3-5 times/day. I finished the druga week ago and still having mild_ watery to creamy bowel moments. However_ the worse was an itch rash from hell the day I ended the treatment. Neck to feet. My back was so rashy that it look like it had been sunburned. I eventually had to go get a steroid shot to control the itching.,The rash started to slowly fad after a week (on a steroid though). I'm concerned about the diarrhea and hope it's not c-diff. It's not any worse so I'm just going to keep an eye on it. Doc wanted me to take Flagyl but I just don't think I can handle another bottle of poison right now. I'll get tested for c-diff before I take something to cure it. Most people clear mild cases of c-diff on their own anyway. Bottom line: Take some else besides Clindamycin. It has too many risks.,M,38,9  days300mg 3X D,10/12/2015,Clindamycin hcl

57, 2, Root Canal,Heartburn_swelling and soreness of the vagina and butt. Very heavy vaginal discharge. Blurred vision and heavy gas.,I took this medicine for 10 days following my root canal and I have had the worse experience ever. Soreness and tender vagina and butt. When to the ER for swelling of both and was told it was a side effect of the medicine. I hope to NEVER take this medicine again!,F,32,10  days150 mg,10/5/2015Email,Clindamycin hcl
58, 4, 6 week sinus infection,Mild on/off nausea for an hour after taking but that all went away on day 4. On day 3_ the watery diarrhea kicked in and lasted for the duration. It was mild. Usually a couple times morning and couple times at night. No heartburn and a couple times I went straight to bed. My stomach has always been tough though. On Day 3/4_ my sporadic low grade fever I'd been having for 6 weeks was gone. I think I'm cured. Fingers crossed.,I took this drug after Amoxicillian failed to work. During my course of Clindamycin_ I took Jarrows saccharomyces boulardii (two mornng and one night)_ a good probiotic between antibiotic doses_ and lots of yogurt. This antibiotic can cause C-Diff only if you have the C-Diff bacteria in your colon. I took the saccharomyces boulardii in case I had it.,M,42,10  days300mg 3X D,10/3/2015,Clindamycin hcl
