0, 5, acute dermatitis,slightly oilier skin,This shouldn't be used long term. I've been on it for about 6 years but I don't use it everyday. I get a rash of tiny bumps all over my face that makes it's way down my neck. It itches_ is very uncomfortable and unsightly. Usually when it starts I use the cream. It relieves the itching immediately and the the rash is gone within 2-3 days. It IS a must have medication for me.,F,34,6  years,11/29/2006,Cutivate
