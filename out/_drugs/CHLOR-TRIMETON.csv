0, 5, Seasonal allergies,"None as long as I take 1/2 of a 4 mg tablet. When I take a whole table (4 mg) I feel very ""spacey"".",I take 1/2 of a 4 mg tablet every morning because I have a lot of allergies. During the months when the Cedar trees are puffing their pollen ( Dec_ Jan_ Feb) I sometimes have to take 1/2 tablet every 4 hours through the day and night.,F,73,8  years2 mg 1X D,1/16/2016,Chlor-trimeton
1, 3, seasonal allergies,Caused a sort of speedy feeling - a bit like I had too many cups of coffee - and caused my heart rate to go through the roof @ 120bpm while resting. Will not be taking it again.,Unfortunately I can't continue to take this because of the rise in heart rate it caused but it did relieve a lot of my symptoms. It was as good as Zyrtec_ better than Claritin and totally different from Benadryl. None of the grogginess but if you are sensitive to decongestants (despite that this is NOT one)_ you might want to avoid it.,F,42,3  days4mg 2X D,5/6/2014Email,Chlor-trimeton
2, 5, Allergies and Allergy Related Sympt,Unfortunately_ when I first take the drug_ there is a brief (45 min +/-) period where my nose becomes terribly itchy.  In the evening hours I become more sleepy than without_ however it's very easy to remain awake during the day.,With seasonal allergies_ and my need to drive a vehicle for work_ this is by far the best medicine on the market.  The 4 hour is my personal preference.  Directly after the itchiness_ there is immediate and sustained relief of post-nasal drip_ allergy related headache and watery eyes.

3, 4, Seasonal allergies,Sometimes causes drowsiness; sometimes not.,This is the best over the counter simple tried and true med out there!  It's affordable and I appreciate that it only lasts for 4 hours!Love it!  May it never_ ever go away.,F,53,1  years 1X D,2/1/2013,Chlor-trimeton
4, 2, itchiness,dry mouth_ severe irritability_ twitching in neck muscles_ blank thoughts_ trouble speaking properly,I wanted this to work without side effects based on other reviews here.  No such luck_ at least for me.  I do think the medication helped slightly with my itchiness_ but was very short acting.  What has not been short acting are the side effects.  My mouth is much drier than it ever gets with Benadryl over 12 hours after taking 1/2 the recommended dosage as a test before bedtime.  I'm glad I didn't take the whole pill.  I couldn't keep a thought in my head for hours after I woke up_ and when I tried to speak I kept stumbling over words_ leaving words out or saying the wrong words.  Not good. Also I'm way more irritable than normal.,M,50,1  times2 mg 1X O,10/8/2012,Chlor-trimeton
5, 4, allergies,None so far,,M,33,1  days4mg,1/23/2012Email,Chlor-trimeton
6, 2, Allergy and asthma,I took this medication hoping to get some help from asthma due to allergies. The other posts seemed like it might work. This medication did not help me and made me feel worse. It causes a rapid heart beat_ bad dreams and no relief from trouble breathing. Now I have a full package minus one pill.,Will not take again.,F,55,1  days30mg 1X D,6/5/2011,Chlor-trimeton
7, 5, seasonal allergies,drowsiness and dopey feeling if I take it with a decongestant (like Sudafed); otherwise nothing bothersome.,I used Chlor-Trimeton to manage my hay fever from age 15 through maybe age 30_ when i moved to an area where my allergies were milder and didn't need medicine.  When i returned to the pollen-rich land of my childhood five years later_ I tried Claritin (which didn't work well) and Zyrtec (which made me feel depressed and hopeless).  Now I am back to good old Chlor-Trimeton_ which works well without awful side effects.,F,40,25  years4 mg 2X D,5/20/2011Email,Chlor-trimeton
8, 4, post-nasal drip_ indoor allergies,none,Would prefer a 10 or 12 hour version to be available,F,25,1  months,1/12/2010,Chlor-trimeton
9, 4, allergies,I began taking chlor-trimeton after I was diagnosed with hypertention. Before that I took sudafed_ which is useless. Zyrtec and all other allergy meds cause me to have an irregularheartbeat. I think it does help me to sleep better at night_ but I am not sleepy during the day.,It helps a cough_ runny nose_ and itchy eyes. I think it is very good.,F,72,6  weeks,7/5/2009,Chlor-trimeton
10, 4, Seasonal allergy,With the 4-hour tablet I get drowsiness_ though not as much as with other products. The 12-hour tablet makes me less drowsy_ but is sometimes hard to find.,In more than 58 years of dealing with allergy_ this is so far the best of the bunch.,M,60,15  years,4/7/2008,Chlor-trimeton
11, 4, bronchial allergy cough,It stopped the cough completely_ but also made me sleep better at night - I'm normally a very light sleeper and wake up tired.   Chlortrimeton did not sedate me during the day_ but I did sleep longer and better at night consistently....,I switched to zyrtec when it went over the counter_ which works well enough for allergy and cough related asthma (which I have) but my anxiety seems increased - not terribly so_ maybe it's just that I stopped the chlortrimeton.   I may switch back.  Not sure,F,48,1  years,2/13/2008,Chlor-trimeton
