0, 4, Acne_ sensitive skin,Nausea,"I started using generic Dynacin at the suggestion of my dermatologist. My skin_ which is very sensitive but also prone to acne_ was becoming more difficult to ""balance"" and I started seeing more pimples appear that weren't going away. I noticed a difference in as little as two days after I started taking it: small pimples began to clear up and a big cyst that I had grew smaller. However_ I began to experience nausea that_ through process of elimination_ I came to assume is due to this medication. From here I plan on taking it as needed_ now that my skin has mostly cleared up.",F,16,4  days100 mg 1X D,4/24/2010,Dynacin
