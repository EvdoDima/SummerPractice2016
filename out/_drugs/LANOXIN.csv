1, 4, CHF,None as far as I can tell.,I was put on digoxin and spironlactone (water pill) at the same time when I was diagnosed with CHF. Due to the water pill I peed 11 lbs of water the first 24 hours I was on it_ and could finally sleep flat and not sitting up on 4 pillows. it was glorious to curl up in a little ball with no irregular heart beat and just sleep! one thing i learned is that it is imperative to drink enough water while on digoxin_ as if you don't_ it can turn into a poison and you can slip into a coma_ especially if exercise is involved on say a hot day. so drink plenty of water plus other liquids. blood tests to check your digoxin blood levels are also imperative_ it must be at a certain level to work effectively. My blood levels have just gotten too low and I have been having heart problems again.,F,56,3  years,8/29/2008,Lanoxin

6, 2, Heart problems,Mom was given Lanoxin_ within 4 days she had stomach problems_ nausea_ diarrhea_ was anxious/nervous and was mental slow. It took 2 weeks of contacting the doctor and a week in the hospital to convince the doctors that her problem was caused by the pill - not age. Within 2 days of stopping the pill_ she started to feel better.,The doctors said it created a toxic gas in her stomach causing the nausea and not eating feeling. At first the doctors said she was just not wanting to eat but..   Note:  Please ensure you take care of your elderly family members and listen to their comments.
