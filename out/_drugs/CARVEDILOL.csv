1, 1, Suffered a stroke,was given this in hospital after initially suffering a stroke on 6/30/15 not sure I had a high blood pressure problem following physical checkup on May 15_2015. Initially after given this drug I noticed I was unable to sleep for longer than 1 hour at a time in hospital. Brushed it off as being in the hospital. After discharge on July 13th still could not sleep at home for more than 1-2 hours at a time. Also began to feel light headedness daily in the mornings after waking up. After not sleeping ( sleeping medication trazadone 50 mg) didn't allow me to sleep any better I researched Carvedilol on Internet and discovered that like most beta blockers it cause insomnia. My doctor took me off Carvedilol after 1st prescribing 2 mg Lunesta didn't help me sleep either. No taking linsinopril sleeping much better.,,M,60,2  months3.125mg 2X D,9/10/2015,Carvedilol
