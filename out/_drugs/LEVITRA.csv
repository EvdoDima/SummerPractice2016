0, 1, ED,Eschemic episode fake stroke momentarily lost all body control I required medical attention to see if I was not having real stroke.  I workout 4 to 5 x a week.  I will never use this drug again. Nurse who provided medical attention said the same thing happened to her husband This drug is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.,Do not take this drug!!!!,M,60,1  days,7/2/2016Email,Levitra

3, 5, To help maintain an erection.,None.,Though my health and fitness are good_ due to BPH I had trouble consistently maintaining an erection.  My urologist prescribed 20 mg Levtra_ but wary of side-effects I let it side on the shelf for about 10 months before finally giving it a try.  The directions said to cut the pills into fourths and start with 5 mg_ so I did.  5 mg worked very well with no side effects.  I've found since that cutting the 5 mg chunks in half and taking 2-3 mg on successive day works even better--I can maintain my erection both days and on the second day have amazing stamina and drive.  My erections are rock hard_ they last for an hour or more (my girlfriend and I are in no hurry)_ and my orgasms are incredible.  Levitra makes me feel young again and works great.  Wow_ wow and wow pretty much sums it up.,M,65,45  days5 mg 1X D,10/14/2015,Levitra
4, 5, To improve sexual performance,I have never had any side effects when using Levitra. When I first felt the need to use sexual enhancement medication I used Viagra. It was reasonably effective but I quickly abandoned it because of the side effects: especially the slightly blurred vision and headache. I then went on to Cialis_ which didn't have such side effects but was far less effective in what it is supposed to do. To my immense relief I then found that Levitra not only is very effective but also gives me no side effects at all!,Though I had no real erectile dysfunction_ I noticed my erections losing some of their old strength. My partner is younger than me_ and though she could easily arouse me enough for intercourse_ I knew I wasn't as big and hard as I used to be. So I began to lose a bit of confidence in my ability to satisfy her. After unsatisfactory attempts with Viagra (side effects)_ Levitra has given me back everything I used to have - and more. My erection is hard_ and I think somewhat thicker than it has ever been though no longer. [I have no 'before' and 'after' measurements_ but it seems that Levitra expands the blood vessels widthways_ rather than lengthways.] Certainly I get a fantastic feeling of being fully 'pumped up' - like pumping up your biceps with weights - and of course women tend to find extra girth more satisfying than extra length. The other_ entirely unexpected benefit of Levitra is that it reduces the urge to ejaculate. I can perform intercourse for much longer (like a pornstar!) and even after ejaculating I stay quite hard_ so it doesn't need much more stimulation to be ready for another round. Levitra really proved its worth this summer when we took part in a foursome with a couple on holiday. I had no fears of failure. My partner joked that it was the sight of the excessively large bulge in my very brief swimming trunks (caused by Levitra the night before!) that attracted the couple on the neighbouring sun loungers. Maybe she has a point!,M,54,4  years10 mg 1X AN,9/23/2015Email,Levitra

6, 4, Difficulty in maintaining erection,Occasional flushing_ stuffy nose,I have found that one definitely needs to be stimulated for it to work best and so we plan our use ( once a fortnight) to a night or w/e out of town where my wife can leave her bra and inhibitions behind and dress to show off her breasts & nipples and the rest of her very curvaceous figure in sheerish tops and short tight skirts. We both know what we are going for and this heightens the anticipation for good sustained lovemaking as does to be frank the attention her displaying her mature 55yo figure gets from other guys. We both enjoy her getting this attention and although we haven't done anything about it our w/es are on the agreed basis of 'no limits' sexually and fantasies are harmless.  We look forward to these special adventures and that also stimulates reasonable non enhanced love making in between. The real difference is non enhanced I am good for one climax with Levitra a really good hard erection_ which she notices_ comments on and enjoys_  and 3/4 climaxes.,M,65,4  months10mg 1X D,7/2/2015,Levitra
7, 4, Age related ED.,Slight flushing and stuffy nose.,I'm pretty healthy man_ non-smoker. I simply wanted to try Levitra (10 mg) in order to compare it with Stendra (100 mg). Both pills work just fine_ although it took almost an hour for Levitra to start working versus 15-20 minutes for Stendra. Plus Levitra caused known side effects while Stendra did not give any side effects at all. Erections were strong and prolonged_ my wife was satisfied. The desired result was achieved.,M,53,2  days10 1X D,5/17/2015,Levitra
8, 5, Enhanced performance,Felt a little flushed while it lasted and exhausted after I put it to the test with my wife. No other side effects but smiles. Viagra (25mg) gave me a wicked headache that no aspirin or Motrin could cure. Cialis (10mg) s good for 2 days but not a rock hard erection for as long.,By far Levitra made me the hardest - rock hard for a good hour or so at just 10mg. My wife (42) was very pleased indeed with my prolonged and slow thrusting that she had a couple of nice prolonged orgasms to my one with her second. Six hours later she wanted more. Levitra did not fail me - without taking more. When she is happy_ I am happy.,M,60,1  times10mg 1X AN,5/12/2015,Levitra
9, 4, Erectile disfunction,Slight flushing and nasal stuffiness. Head ache the next morning,Tried Levitra as an alternative to Viagra. Pretty much the same results for me.  Was able to get an erection when sexually stimulated through foreplay about 30 minutes after taking the drug.  Erection was long_ hard and thick.  Was able to satisfy my wife and myself by maintaining an erection through penetration_climax and ejaculation.  My wife was pleased that I was able to thrust for so long without losing my erection.  Erectile dysfunction drugs work for me and would recommend them if you are having such problems_,M,60,7  days20 1X D,3/20/2015,Levitra
10, 1, Erectile Dysfunction,Could not get an erection. I _ as well as my wife_ feel frustrated,,M,69,2  days30,3/1/2015,Levitra
11, 5, Sometimes couldn't suatain an erect,No side effects,Huge increase in performance - erection really hard and lasted for nearly 90 minutes and two climaxes. Got another erection in the morning and third climax. Wife and setting helped with romantic meal in hotel and staying over to set the scene for my first test with the drug. Her going braless in public with short skirt and stockings helped make it a truly awesome experience,M,65,1  days10mg 1X D,1/29/2015,Levitra
12, 4, Difficulty maintaining har erection,Stuffy nose_ light headedness_ difficulty breathing. Feels like lungs collapsing sometimes.,Works like magic every time. I split 20 mg six ways. That way effects are minimal and it gives me 30 of good sex_ until ejaculation. Then it goes down_ and doesn't bother like higher dosage does,M,28,2  months2.5,12/12/2014Email,Levitra
13, 4, E.d,Bloated_headache_hang-over_ fatigue_  nasal congested.,It did it's job. I was able to decrease the side of effects by not drinking alcohol (on day of usage) eating small healthy meals_ but most importantly drinking a lot of TEA!!! it made using this drug very tolerable and decrease the side affects to a minimum.I know everyone is different but drinking tea around 4-6 cups doing usage has help me the most.. if your dealing with this problem it's worth a shot guys .. Really hope it helps you as much as it has help me because those side are brutal.,M,29,1  years20mg 2X W,6/10/2013Email,Levitra
14, 2, ED,Headaches_ nasal congestion_ coughing_ overall flu-like symptoms for days afterwards.,The erection it helped produce was great_ so it did what it was supposed to but the side effects were brutal. It would be impossible for me to take this medication and function on a daily basis.,M,44,1  days10 MG 1X D,1/19/2013,Levitra
15, 5, My erections don't last.,I sometimes have a dull headache after_ but nothing serious. Also_ for about a day after I get impromptu erections.,,M,48,2  years20mg,12/21/2012Email,Levitra
16, 1, Why does anyone take an ED pill?,No side effects.,Actually no real effects at all. I have tried Levitra several times only to disappoint myself and my wife. Tried again tonight_ took one-half and gave it an hour_ didn't work so I took another. Little effect. What now?,M,64,2  years10MG 1X AN,12/2/2012Email,Levitra
17, 5, Erectile Dysfunction,Stuffy nose_ LSD like high with regular dose. Makes me extremely horny.  It gives me the BEST hardon of any of the choices. Much bigger and harder.  It lasts in my system 5 days.  Ready at anytime I want it and sometimes when I am not :-) I cut the little pill in 1/4s.  One quarter still does the trick for me and the good effects last for about 4 days. The bad effects_ like the trippy feeling diminish considerably. I take care of the stuffiness with Afrin.  Viagra makes me terribly sick with absolutely no hardon.  Cialis works ok but not as well. I have to take Cialis the day before so it will work when I want it the next day. Gives me a headache also.,,M,50,10  months,7/27/2012,Levitra
18, 4, Post Proton Beam for prostate cance,The usual side effects_ such as nasal congestion_ slight headache_ but nothing too dramatic.,I tried the Cialis for daily use.  Not effective unless you take four tablets and then wonder why you are doing that_ especially at the cost.  Went back to Levitra_ told my wife when I took it_ and then we planned sex accordingly.  I do wake up with morning hard ons_ and a little masturbating helps_ so I am pleased o really.  At 67 I am doing fine and still enjoy a good romp in the sack_ even if it is not spontaneous.  We all wish the little man could stand tall on a moments notice_ but . . .,M,67, 20 mg 2X W,3/18/2012,Levitra
19, 4, E.D.,Slight headache.minor stomache upset_moderate stuffy nose,"After trying viagra and getting the ""blue haze effect_tried Vardenafil. Worked best for me after waiting 90 min. before sexual activity. No visual side affects. Works well_ but stuffy nose makes sleeping difficult afterwards. Will try nasal spray to overcome this(?)",M,67,60  days20Mg. 1X D,2/13/2012Email,Levitra
20, 5, Looking for a boost,Stuffy nose_ headache. Relatively minor muscle ache.,I really didn't think I needed it_ but I wanted a boost_ and I talked my doctor into writing a script. Worked fast and it induced the biggest erection I've  ever had. I didn't measure it_ but it was noticeably bigger_ especially in girth. seems to work longer than advertised.Will definitely use again.,M,49, 10MG 1X AN,1/23/2012Email,Levitra
21, 5, Erectile dysfunction,Some nasal congestion and much less often_ a minor headache.I had tried using Cialis_ but a cumulative overdose left me severe back pain that lasted for weeks. I've never had anything comparable happen like that with Levitra. Just wish it was cheaper.,The effectiveness of Levitra is DRAMATICALLY affected by whether or not you have food in your stomach. Especially oil or fat in the meal. Taking Levitra on an empty stomach_ like when first waking up_ has the most dramatic effect on good sexual performance. However_ taking it after a full meal gives me little effect at all_ at 10mg. So now I make a point of having a mostly or completely empty stomach before taking it and then the effect is rapid and strong.,M,55,3  years10 mg 1X W,6/28/2011Email,Levitra
22, 3, More Reliable Erection,"Slight headache_ ""foggy""-headed.",For me_ 1/4 of a 20mg (highest dosage pill for Levitra) pill didn't have the effect when I was tired that 1/4 of a Viagra (100mg) has. Took the 1/4 Levitra_ and getting an erection was the same as not taking anything_ whereas 1/4 of the Viagra gets me very hard and allows for a stiff one for the next 12-24 hours. (No_ the erection doesn't last 12-24 hours_ but it's available when needed.) I recommend Viagra over Levitra since it can be cut into quarters and still works. Emails with comments/comparisons/questions welcome.,M,58,1  days20 1X D,2/12/2011Email,Levitra
23, 4, ED,Flushing face. Nasal congestion or maybe slight swelling? Very bad headache.,The side effects were pretty intense_ and the headache lasted for ten hours after originally taking the pill. However_ I was able to prove to my lady that I truly am into her. She had been depressed as she thought it was her fault. Started working within 15 minutes of taking the pill_ and I lasted for an hour and a half. Twenty minutes later_ we went for five minutes before I had an orgasm. However_ this time_ I was able to let her keep going while_ and after I got off. She and I both liked that. It felt just as great as normal_ except I wasn't extremely sensitive as I always am after an orgasm. Overall_ it worked amazingly. Although the headache was very bad_ and I couldn't breath through my nose at all_ I'd say it was pretty much worth it.,M,27,3  weeks20MG 1X D,1/18/2011Email,Levitra
24, 1, ED,None,Just didn't work at all.Switched to Viagra and it worked.,M,64,30  days20 1X D,9/10/2010,Levitra
25, 4, ed,None other than sone spontaneous erections.,"Levitra worked fiarly well for me.  About 30 minutes after taking I would get a hard dick and be able to maintain a good stiff dick for some long term healthy sex. If my girl friend was willing I was usually up to a second round within 30 minutes.  The effects would last 10 - 12 hours. so sometimes I wake in the morning at home with a rock hard and have to do a little hand work. Do not recommed to take during the day due to spontaneous erections.  I had this happen at the gym once and it can cause more than little embarrassment to have 9"" boner jump out in the shower with 5 - 6 other guys.  No way to hide it...  All in all very good pill if you need help to get and keep erections.  Just be ready to have sex soon after you take or else you will have to take matterd into you own hands.",M,52,6  months20 mg 1X D,7/5/2010,Levitra
26, 5, Impotence,Flushing but no negative side effects.,"The quality of my erections had begun tapering off before I reached middle age. In middle age erections mostly useless -  I was having about a 25% success rate as far as penetration was concerned. In my middle fifties Viagra came on the market and for about ten years I enjoyed a success rate of about 60% - 70% (funny how you tend to remember the failures). Now that I'm in my late sixties I find myself having fewer successful attempts than a few years ago and have been experimenting with all the meds - including the ""generics"" online. I definitely get the best - serviceable if not dependable - erections from Levitra.  Although Cials is definitely the longest working Levitra is good for at least 12 hours and because it gives me firmer - if not exactly ridged - erections I'm going to stick with Levitra..",M,69,7  years20 Mg 1X D,5/23/2010Email,Levitra
27, 4, ed,Stuffy nose_ fatigue.,Good stuff_ lasts about 3-4 hours after waiting 40 min. Viagra was weak and got teh blue haze thing.,M,50,1.5  years,1/31/2010,Levitra
28, 4, ED,Severe Stuffy Nose,I realize I'm quite young and shouldn't have to take something like this_ however_ I've had severe erectile dysfunction for two year before resorting to this pill for help. From my experiences_ Levitra takes 15 minutes to start working_ 30 MINUTES for full results. I have experienced no side effects other than a SEVERE STUFFY NOSE. Usually taking only half the dosage two hours before the second will prevent this. Effects tend to last 10 HOURS or so for me. I am very pleased with it.,M,24,6  months,11/30/2009,Levitra
29, 4, ED,Stuffy nose. Slight headache sometimes.,Don't take after drinking coffee or anything caffinated. The stronger the coffee the poorer Levitra acts_ with shortened erection time frame and it can make one very sleepy if too much coffee is consumed.,M,63,3  years,11/18/2009Email,Levitra
30, 5, ED,I am a diabetic and 20 mg did the trick. It lasted to the next day for me. I got facial fushing which you know it has kicked in and headache afterwards but it is all gone by the next day. I have cut the 20 in half and it still works fine with less side effects.,,M,49,6  months,10/3/2009,Levitra
31, 1, Lack of quality erection,I switched to Cialis and it works for me.  Levitra caused my ears to turn red_ itch and burn.  Facial flushing was horrible.  It looked as though I had a really bad sun burn.,I have tried all 3; first Viagra_ then Levitra_ and now Cialis.  I am staying with cialis_ on 10MG as needed.,M,47,3  years,6/4/2009,Levitra
32, 2, ED,About one hour after taking the headache began.  For 24 hours after taking had bad headache_ general fatigue and generally felt like doing nothing.  I won't say I wouldn't recommend this just because it doesn't work for me_ but the side effects far_ far outweigh the benefits.,,M,55,1  days,6/2/2009,Levitra
33, 5, Age related ED,Slight facial flushing as the med takes hold; a good indicator that it's about time to get my money's worth.  Nothing else except maybe a slightly stuffy nose_ but it's less a problem than my normal alergies.,I changed to Levitra after finally (after three years) realizing that the Cialis was causing my heartburn and seriously exacerbating what had been minor back pain.  So far the Levitra is working exceptionally for me.  Phew!,M,63,3  months,4/16/2009,Levitra
34, 2, performance,Massive headache 2 hours after taking levitra.,I noticed a small improvement in performance but had a terrible headache later on.I tought my head was going to explode. Sensitive to light and sound. Not fun. Killed the evening. I won't be taking Levitra again.,M,48,1  days,3/20/2009Email,Levitra
35, 5, ED,Blurred vision_ stuffy nose_ light sensitivity.,Works great for me.  Cialis nor Viagra did a thing for me.  The Viagra caused the worse headaches I have ever had.  There was no way I would have wanted sex even if it had produced an erection.  Which it did not.  Cialis did absolutely nothing.  Levitra_ even if I cut it into quarters_ works for me even 3 days later.  Hardon anytime I want one too.  Very happy with it.The stuffy nose is easily taken care of with Afrin spray or something similar.Love it.  I just wish that it wasn't so expensive.,M,47,2  years,2/4/2009,Levitra
36, 5, ed,Headache morning after and flushed face.,This ed medication has allowed me to experience multiple erections and orgasm within 2 hours for first time since in my 30's.

38, 3, ED,moderate flushing_ headache_stuffy nose_ nausea,Took less than the required dose & it worked but the side effects were too much to continue taking it. Viagra works so much better for me with very minimal side effects. Levitra lasted longer but Viagra was much less a problem.,M,44,2  months,5/6/2008,Levitra
39, 5, ED,Stuffy nose and congestion,Great stuff!  Aside from the stuffy nose_ I am very satisfied with this medication.  I was reluctant to take a medication_ but with a little prodding from my girlfriend_ I finally decided to try it.  I am so glad that I did!  I take it about an hour before sex and have had absolutley no letdowns!,M,35,3  months,3/29/2008,Levitra

41, 5, ED induced by SSRIs,Blurry vision that lasted less than a few hours... but after all_ I'm trying to read after taking the drug.,Works fine...  great for the ED.  Did not help with the ejaculation issues by my SSRI.  I didn't need the drug after my SSRIs were regulated and could gain an erection on my own.,M,31,4  weeks,2/23/2008,Levitra

45, 5, Age-related Impotence/Venous leak,NO SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS! Facial flushing(slightly more pronounced than facial flushing I get from Cialis). Small price to pay when compared to the red face a guy gets when he can't rise to the occasion. Bonus at 66: morning erection next day even after ejaculating the night before.,Powerful stuff! Originally labeled effective for 4 hours. In Europe the label reads 7 to 8 hours and now it seems to be regarded as at least that or longer in USA. I use it in conjunction with Cialis. A couple of Cialis a week - works for maintenance (morning erections for 2 days after each dose) and a Levitra just before show time.,M,66,3  years,5/15/2007Email,Levitra
