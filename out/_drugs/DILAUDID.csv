0, 5, Tonsillectomy,This is by far the best pain med out there. Pain went from like 10 to zero in minutes _ it's amazing! Not happy that the doctor only gave me such a small dose of it. I was taking Tylenol with codeine for the pain at first and it did NOTHING! All in all great pain med despite all the side effects.,My side effects: Drowsy_insomnia_ nausea_ hallucinations,F,41,1  days1mg oral l,7/13/2016Email,Dilaudid
1, 5, After spinal surgery,No side effects,The best post operative pain reliever I have ever experienced after major surgery . I was first on morphine and it felt like they were still inside of me working . I asked them to please change it to delaudid because I had experience with it three times before . My pain level went from 10 to zero in seconds,F,64,3  days? 6X AN,7/2/2016,Dilaudid
2, 4, Chronic low back pain_ post surgery,Constipation_ more then likely due to surgery and amount of hydrocodone taken trying to relieve pain.,I've had chronic low back pain since I turned 20. I was having to take hydrocodone everyday to get through work. By the time I turned 24 I was taking 10's. Over this year it's began to not work as wel and after I just had surgery to remove cysts from both ovaries the surgeon told me that I may have to take two 10's being I've been on it since I was 18_ that I may have a hard time managing the pain. He was both right_ and wrong. Taking two 10's didn't help with the pain at all. On Wednesday the day after surgery I couldn't take it anymore and he prescribed me hydromorphone 4mg tablets to take every six hours. Being i was already constipated_ it helped some but hardly took the edge off_ after finally going to the bathroom there's been a bit more improvement but still painful. I'm not an abuser of any medication but I've been tempted to take two to see if it helps more with relieving the pain. My pain level on a scale of 1-10_ I'm currently at an 8/9 the lowest I've reached is about a 7. Better then the 12/13 hysterical level I was at this morning. Any advice is much appreciated from other chronic pain suffers. I think this would be a better medication for me then the Vicodin as even on a bad day taking two tens does nothing anymore.,F,28,3  days4mg,5/27/2016Email,Dilaudid

4, 5, stomach obstruction,None,This drug is a miracle. I have been in the hospital 3 weeks for a stomach obstruction & I grind my teeth too_ my tooth broke from having vitamin deficiency for so long. This medicine has helped for both issues_ helps to calm my achy body_ & helps my pain for longer than hydrocodone. Not everyone feels this way_ but everyone is different.

10, 3, back pain,The medication helped only a little bit. The problem was that I had to take so much oral to work and it didn't last that long.  The long acting dialiud is worthless. I was taking 2? 32mg a day. The I.R was better relief then the E.R. Anyway I was a little tired and had weird dreams.,Me and my doctor honestly thought that going from oxycodone to Dialiud would work better because it's much stronger.  That's always not the case. I know everyone is different but after reading so many others response to dialiud_  I was surprised to what I read.  So many others though the Samething as me.  That dialiud's half life was very poor and that it really didn't help with the pain compared to oxycodone.  The I.V dialiud was so much more effective and I didn't need a much.  Compared to the 32mg oral I was taking.  I only needed 8 mg of I.V to equal that.  I wish they could formulate the oral like the I.V. It would really be a great pain medication if they could do that.  But the half life is crap and it also has low Bio.,M,46,5  weeks32,6/29/2015,Dilaudid

15, 5, migraines_ post op pain_ iv in er,First time I had this was after my hysterectomy_ nurse pushed it way too fast and almost stopped my heart. I usuallyget this in IV form in the ER for migraines that last weeks. I always make sure they give me the anti-nausea meds first to stop any vomiting and headache nausea. I get compozine_ dilauded_ toradol_ and benadryl (in that order) and the headache stops immediately. The cocktail makes me very tired_ but sleep is best for migraines anyway. The benadryl helps with the itching_ too.,I have so many drug allergies that finding a cocktail that works is a miracle. I just wish drs would stop treating me like an addict because I ask for what works and what I'm not allergic too.  I have a great neuro that closely monitors my meds just to prevent addiction.  I've tried occipital nerve blocks and many other treatments. Can't afford Botox.  Will stick with what works.,F,44,  1X D,5/5/2015,Dilaudid

18, 4, Severe digital ulcers - Scleroderma,none,My ulcer on my first finger was excruciating_ to the point where I asked my doc to chop off my finger. She wisely suggested we get the pain under control before such a drastic measure. She prescribed Dilaudid 4mg every 4 hours. At first_ after researching on the net_ I was reluctant to take it so I only took half the prescription (2mgs). While the pain lessened it was not under control. Pharmacist kindly reinforced the need to take meds as prescribed (4mgs). Pain now under control as long as I do not skip doses. Wound clinic suggests I take the meds before coming in for next treatment. I will. For my severe pain_ so far this medicine works. I will only be using the meds short term_ hopefully I'll not have withdrawal symptoms as described_ but if so_ so be it.,F,47,6  days4mg,2/7/2015Email,Dilaudid

I slept for most of the next 48 hours. 4 days later I am having stomach cramps_ constipation_ goosebumps_ nausea_ tremors. I haven't taken anything else so I assume these are side effects as well.

22, 4, gallbladder,Hospitalized for gallstone blocking liver duct_ which resulted in jaundice and infection of the gallbladder_ and start of pancreatitis. Once admitted from er_ doctor only gave me half the recommended dose of 2 mg. Relieved my pain_ but would give me huge head rush when administered. Also had sever itching_ but was most likely caused by the jaundice since I was already itching.. Next day_ the new doctor put me on the full 2 mg dose to ensure pain management. Within 10 seconds of the full dose being administered_ I was doubled over in horrible pain from back spasms. This would only last for about a minute_ but happened with each dose_ so I was given a dose of valium beforehand. Never heard of pain meds CAUSING pain. BUT.... once the spasms stopped_ my pain was relieved. Some nausea_ but was on Iv anti nausea meds. I give it a higher rating because it did make the pain go away until they were able to get my surgery done. Everyone reacts differently with meds_ I guess I just have a weird reaction.

Some areas of severe pain on my neck went away but other areas on my neck were still there full force just as before. The symptoms all lasted until the medicine finally wore off. I could actually feel when it was wearing off. I will never allow this in my body again_ I have never in my life felt as much pain as I did when I went in the hospital that day_ and when I left I still had the pain and all of the symptoms above to go along with it.

I had a PCA pump for the spinal surgery and was only on Dilaudid about 12 hours or so. I wish I'd been able to do that with the hysterectomy--I had to call and request it_ which meant I was already in a lot of pain by the time someone got there. They only allowed 3 doses over a 24 hour period_ which wasn't sufficient. For post-op pain_ this is the best thing I've had. However_ I know it doesn't work well for everyone--sorry about that and hope you can find something that does.,F,46,2  days 3X D,12/17/2013,Dilaudid

Extreme drowsiness.,At a clinic to get relief from a  3rd day migraine I was given dilaudid in a shot in place of regular morphine which is what I had recieved in the past.  Morphine had no side effects except for drowsiness and itching.  Dilaudid caused immediate vomiting and dizziness.  Had to be brought to the car in a wheel chair with a plastic container.  Could not move for at least 2 hrs without dizziness and vomiting. Did eliminate the pain of the migraine_ but not sure if it was actually worth it.

Before I had the pain pump implanted I had an electric stim that wasn't helping much at all. I was pretty much disabled and rarely left home. Once the pain pump was implanted and I starting the Dilaudid my life totally changed. Was able to go back to work and do things with my family again. Still can't lift or do any physical things but my quality of life improved so much. That's why this inching concerns me now.
