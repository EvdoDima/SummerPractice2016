0, 2, Granuloma Annulare,Stomach ache which would send me back to bed for an hour each morning_ frequent (5+ times per day) loose stools_ severe depression.,Thought this might be helpful with Granuloma Annulare that I had had for over 30 years_ but I couldn't deal with the side effects which continued even after lowering dose. I am very sensitive to a lot of medicines_ so others may not have such a bad experience.,F,52,5  days400 mg 3X D,7/17/2012,Trental
1, 4, Poor Blood Flow,None,This product was prescribed to me due to the poor blood flow to my hands and feet_ making them feel like ice most of the time. At the same time_ the poor blood flow was causing my serious knee injury to heal rather slowly. After taking this medication for the past 9 months 3 times a day_ I am very impressed. I don't get cold as easily and the colder weather doesn't attack my joints with as much force as it once did. Very good product!,F,21,9  months,10/16/2008,Trental
