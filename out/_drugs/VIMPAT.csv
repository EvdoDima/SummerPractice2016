6, 4, Partial seizures,Stunted emotions,"This is my second time taking and my second rating. I asked to be put back on Vimpat as my doctor was ready to send me to an EMU to be evaluated and mentioned possible surgery and I did not want that. Last time_ in addition to stunted emotions_  I also had personality changes. Although it helped with my seizures_ I could not handle not being ""me"". This time_ while I am still on Keppra_ I added B6 in addition as recommended in a seizure forum. It worked. My emotions are stunted this second time but I am not flying off the handle or getting easily irritated.  I am not thrilled with the emotion thing but at this point in my life_ I'd rather deal with that than going into an EMU and the possibility of surgery. If it should no longer control my seizures down the road_ then I will look into the EMU.",F,47,1  years100 MG 2X D,4/17/2015,Vimpat
7, 1," started having small ""seizures""",Memory loss_ moodiness_ anxious_ emotional_rapid weight gain,"Started having small ""seizures"" when I started perimenopause.  I never had them before this. I was prescribed lamictal which helped a little. Vimpat was added which helped but I started having terrible side effects. Simple things like having eaten at a restaurant in the past I couldn't remember. Things told to me 2 days before I couldn't remember. Im always in a bad mood and cry over nothing. Gained almost 30 lbs since I started taking it. At first I thought I would deal with the side effects since it helped_ but now its not only affecting but my family. If someone had told me this before_ I would never have started it.",F,41,6  months100 mg,2/13/2015,Vimpat

12, 1, grand mal seizures,--Unable to walk due to extreme dizziness (for 2 hours after taking the drug_ I would be unable to walk -- I would need to crawl on all 4 fours to my destination.  I fell frequently because was also very off balance the remainder of the day -- my body was covered with black and blue marks--Unable to talk; slurred words (as when one gets very drunk) and unable to formulate sentences--Not effective; was experiencing 1 - 3 grand mal seizures each week--Memory became an extreme problem -- if I watched a movie in the morning I would have totally forgotten anything about it (or even having seen it) by the afternoon--Extreme depression; I'm sure part of it was simply due to my frequent seizures and the extreme side effects ,l also relayed my problems to Barrows_ the epilepsy foundation and the drug manufacturer but there was no concern from any of these parties.,F,57,3.5  years50 mg 1X D,1/16/2014Email,Vimpat
13, 5, Partial seizures,Noticed forgetfulness. Having trouble remembering little things and choosing between two things. I will need to get  one of two items and grab the wrong item.

14, 2, Partial Seziures,Initially_ Vimpat seemed to be a godsend. The doctor had added it when my Keppra was not completely controlling my seizures. About two weeks ago_ I fell. Not sure what happened. Three says ago_ almost went down again. Vision difficulty for the past couple of weeks. Severe headaches. Beginning to have difficulty reading (something that was happening just before I was diagnosed with Epilepsy--it improved 100% with Keppra but now it is back again) and now_ I have started hallucinating...first auditory and now visually.  My once laid back personality has become more intense_ getting angry and irritable over nothing. My emotions are otherwise flat. Things I should feel happiness_ sadness_ joy_ etc...do not have reaction....irritability and anger are only reactions I have. This is not me.,I am disappointed this is happening_ especially after such a good start on Vimpat.,F,45,10  weeks100 mg 2X D,6/13/2013,Vimpat

18, 5, Epilepsy,Dizziness - at first. My doctor was the Director of Research for the VIMPAT study.  The dizziness was controlled by taking me off of an AED_ and drastically lowering the dose of 2 others. From 800 mg /d of Lamictal to 15 mg /d and from 1000 mg /d Primidone to 400 mg /d.,"The only drug that worked. I had been terminally ill from epilepsy_ no medicine to treat me_ ""Go home and die""_ they had said. I resorted to marijuana for a while. It works_ but being high sucks_ because you can not function in a rational world - living as a happy_ goofy_ blob is no way to live. I gave up marijuana because I hated being fckt up 24/7/365. Vimpat works. The dizziness side effects were controlled by taking me off of Keppra_ lowering by primidone to 400 mg/d_ and by lowering my lamictal to 15mg /d (going off of it). My neuro was the Director of Research for Vimpat when it was an investigational drug.",M,60, 400 2X D,8/2/2012,Vimpat
19, 2, Seizure control,I was removed from Topamax and began taking Vimpat due to continued seizures.  When I began the drug_ I had horrific night panics_ headaches and increased blood pressure.,After about six months_ I acclimated to the medicine; however_ I experienced myoclonic jerks (new to me) and mental confusion about every other month which required Ativan to relieve the symptoms. I'm now titrating off Vimpat and adding Lamictal.  I'm doing much better with Lamictal with minimal side effects.  However_ once I began coming off Vimpat_ the headaches have returned with nausea...but it's worth it.  Of the three anticonvulsants I have tried_ Vimpat has the worst side effects.,F,50,1  years100 2X D,1/28/2012,Vimpat
20, 1, Seizures/Migraines,Severe nausea_ vomiting_ dry-heaves.  I recently tried Vimpat again and 5 days into the 50 mg dose once daily (lowest possible_ I believe)_ I began having severe nausea and dry-heaves yet again.  I've never experienced this much nausea in 20 years of migraine and seizure medication.,,F,29,4  months100mg 2X D,12/24/2011,Vimpat
21, 5," Epilepsy-""mainly partial seizures""","I've probably tried every seizure drug known to man. I was sick of taking Depakote_ due to the side effects_ but my doctor told me that it was the only drug that worked good in the past ""500mgs. a day"". About 5 months ago she called me and told me that she wanted me to try this ""Vimpat""_ needless to say_ ""Praise God!""_I finally found something that works. I have never gone longer than two months without having partial seizures_ that are to me_ the most horrible. Never have I gone this long without them. I'll be due to drive again by December 2nd. Very thankful.",,F,31,5  months150 mg.s 2X D,11/19/2011Email,Vimpat

23, 2, Simple Partial Seizures,short-term memory problems_ depression,I took a minimal dose of Vimpat for 3 months as monotherapy. No seizures_ but began developing depression a week after starting and which got severe over next two months. When I got off_ the depression went away. Not for me.,M,60,3  months 2X D,8/11/2011,Vimpat
24, 5, Epilepsy,Slight dizziness with my second dose increase; it was gone in a day though. Since I have been taking it_ I seem to be yawning a lot. I also feel very hot/overheated more easily. It makes me want to crank the AC. On the plus side_ I have been in a much better mood since starting the Vimpat. Things don't seem to irritate me as easily or as bad.,So far...I LOVE IT! I am also on Oxcarbazepine which seems to be controlling my Grand-mals_ but I was having frequent partials on almost every drug I took. My neuro decided to add on Vimpat to see if it would help. I have not had a seizure of any kind since starting Vimpat. He was even able to lower my dose of Oxcarbazepine without any problems. Don't be afraid to try it just because it is a newer drug.,F,29,1.5  months150 2X D,8/1/2011,Vimpat
25, 3, Epileptic Seizures,hair thinning_ slight balance problems_ insomnia,My dose was increased slowly_ to see at what point the seizures would stop.  Vimpat took away about 75% of my seizures_ but I now also have to take another medicine as well.,F,47,1.5  years400 mg/day 2X D,8/20/2010,Vimpat
