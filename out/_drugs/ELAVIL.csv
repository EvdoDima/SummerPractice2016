0, 5, Anxiety and sleep aid,I've taken this drug twice in my life and it's been a life saver each time. However_ it made me gain 50+ lbs each time. Sounds rediculous I'd take it again but it fixed all my other issues better than anything else I've ever taken. This medicine is great if u have a great handle on diet and exercise. Being small has always been easy for me as I have a very high metabolism....but I didn't stay as active as I needed to to continue this med. I've been changed to nortriptyline and it's decreased my appetite significantly and still works almost as good for anxiety and sleep :),,F,45,1  days50 mg,5/30/2016Email,Elavil

2, 4, Dr. RX  4 migraines cured anxiety!,The first month or so I had experienced side effects such as dry mouth_ constipation_ dry eyes and itching. I did not have all these side effects at one time nor did they all last the full month. It has decreased my appetite significantly. I have lost 15lbs.,"This is the first time in my life that I'm not fearful of ""something"". I'm normally anxiously awaiting an illness_ injury_ or a devastating disaster. I've never known so much contentment. I'm good with that!I still experience some migraines but not near as frequently. I'm very happy with this medicine and plan on keeping it around.",F,42,4  months25 mg,5/8/2016,Elavil
3, 4, Panic attacks & depression,Sleepiness_ but I consider that a good side effect because I always had trouble sleeping.  I also have fewer headaches and less night time itching.  The main unwanted side effect has been brain fog_ and because of that I am looking for alternatives.  For panic attacks_ I would prefer calming_ but will settle for numbing.,Amitriptyline stopped the panic attacks.  It is the most reliable thing I've tried for that.,M,58,8  years50,5/2/2016Email,Elavil
4, 1, Interstitial cystitis,This med turned me into a fat_ sugar-craving zombie. I gained significant weight_ although admittedly I was on other meds with same side effect_ so I think it was a bit of a triple whammy on the weight. Also_ it was very sedating. Even though I took it at night_ the fatigue continued right through the day without fail. That seemed to decrease a little with time_ but not a lot. I never had the least bit of pain relief. I may have had fewer migraines_ but I still had plenty of them - at least 3 days per month.,Again_ I didn't experience any pain relief whatsoever on this med. All it did was give me side effects. I just discontinued it_ so I'm not sure if I will experience an increase in migraines.,F,35,6  months20,4/25/2016,Elavil

6, 4, insomnia,After starting elavil_ blood pressure was dangerously high and developed congestive heart failure.,While it helped with condition prescribed for_ insomnia_ it caused my blood pressure to be high enough to require medication. I was also diagnosed with congestive heart failure when I had never previously had any problems. The least but still concerning effect was rapid weight gain. I gained about 50lbs in a few months. After stopping medication_ blood pressure and heart function are returning to normal. Weight gain has stopped also.,F,46,3  months50mg,4/15/2016,Elavil

10, 5, CFS/ME; Insomnia,None that I'm aware of so far. A little tired the first day or two_ but that's pretty normal for me.,I've tried many different medications for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and it's related symptoms - antidepressants_ benzos_ thyroid meds_ steroids_ antivirals_ stimulants_and on and on.I had been taking trazodone to help with sleep for several years_ but it seemed to be getting less effective. After doing some research_ I asked my doc about Elavil and he was happy to write a script.So far_ I have slept like a baby on it.  I was a little tired for the first couple of days_ but that seems to have faded.  Doc also suggested Lamictal during the day_ which I have not started yet.  I want to use just the Elavil for a few weeks to see its effects before adding anything else into the mix.,M,48,1  weeks10mg,2/19/2016Email,Elavil

14, 4, fibromyalgia,I was feeling it was harder to wake up in morning... my brain was kind of asleep for few hours... so I began to take elavil earlier and now it's better. I take it around 8PM go bed around midnight and able to wake up around10AM (I still need a lot of sleep... or maybe even a little more with elavil).No other side effect.,This week I've started to have more DREAMS :) I'm happy because I've red that dreams occur during the profond/paradoxal sleeping period which is truly good to repair/energize body and also tgat this phase would be almost not there with fibromyalgia... which could explain pains and tireness and everything (I believe)... I also feel less intense pain and I was able to go gym (15-20 min gentle elliptique + gentle hydromassage one day and gentle aquaforme the other day)...I've also change my diet: protein at each meals (gruau/Brown rice/quinoa/small lentils) this is to help muscles... plus green tea instead of coffee (i cut coffe to once or two a week only... like week-end coffee only... and green tea all other times)... I also cut ALL form of stress... and turned my mind into the more positive I can be even if fibromyalgia is truly hard to accept... well... I believe elavil is helping me and I want to keep it as low as possible.,F,35,6  weeks10mg,1/12/2016Email,Elavil

18, 2, Depression,Significant weight gain_ drowsiness_ hyper realistic dreams,Honestly_ I notice the most significant difference in its effect on me if I skip a dose.  I've taken it 13 months now_ and I barely feel different.  It helped a very small amount_ but if for some reason I miss a dose_ I feel 5 times worse.  The dreams are strange--extremely vivid.  All five senses totally engaged.  You feel every single thing as though it were actually happening.  I've always had strange dreams_ but I've never felt as much in a dream as I did on this medication.  Sometimes it's just weird_ but it's often unpleasant (dreaming about being stuck with needles or getting sick or being punched or choked--you feel it even though it's not actually happening).  Last week I took it very late at night (around 1-2 am) and lost the whole next day sleeping.And of course the weight gain.  I was gaining more and more weight even though I hadn't changed my lifestyle.  Did some research_ sure enough_ weight gain is a side effect.  I'm wondering if it's time for me to talk to my doctor about weaning off.,F,21,1  years50 mg,11/23/2015,Elavil
19, 1, Nerve pain in legs and anxiety,I am someone who never gets angry or feels rage_ but since taking this drug I have felt horrible anger and irritability_ this is so not me!

20, 4, General anxiety and social anxiety,"I began 10mg of Elavil (amitriptyline_) once per morning. On the first day_ it took approx 30-45min before I felt much more alert and felt relief from tension. My anxiety usually makes my facial muscles and lips very tense.  Elavil reeve the tension in my face and lips. If tension at its worst is a 10_ Elavil reduced it to about a 5. I was suprised.My anxiety will usually have my handwriting looking terrible when I'm anxious. When I write now_ my handwriting isn't shaky as it used to be. My hand and fingers are much more steady.My thoughts feel less rushed. I'm not on ""overdrive"" as I usually am.  I feel that I can take my time with tasks or when speaking.",I would like to increase my dose to 20mg. I've read that many find Elavil sedating so they take it at night. I take mine in the morning. I doubt I'd sleep at all if I took it at night. It makes me feel wide awake_ focused and calmer at the same time.,M,41,2  weeks10mg,10/25/2015Email,Elavil

25, 5, IBS,A bit groggy in the AM_ otherwise no other negative effects.,I was prescribed this due to my IBS. I had been struggling with mysterious stomach issues for the past several years_ following a strange 8 month long stomach virus. Recently found out what I've been experiencing lately has been ibs. It seemed like every other day there was something going on with my stomach - whether it was nausea_ constipation_ diarrhea_ or just an overall sick feeling. Totally interfered with everyday life_ as I never knew if my stomach would act up. Amitriptyline helps me tremendously. I never experience stomach issues anymore_ and I am MUCH more regular; I love it. I feel normal again. I do take it at bedtime though because it puts me to sleep. Sometimes it does make me feel drowsy for a few hours the next morning_ but it's not a big deal.,F,26,3  months10 mg 1X D,5/21/2015,Elavil

The day after my first bedtime dose I woke up shaking and could not stop crying the entire day. Second day I was worse and very irritable with high anxiety. Third day I missed work due to panic and the shaking. The medicine did help relieve my pain but just was not something my system could tolerate. If you can tolerate it I recommend giving it a go for fibro pain. Every medicine is different for everyone.
