0, 5, Lung Cancer,diarrhea_long eyelashes_ facial hair_ sores on toes and fingers,Risk/benefit clearly shows me that Tarceva is worth the side effects I've had. I take Lomotil as needed for the diarrhea (usually a couple of times a week). I have the facial hair waxed and the beautician trims my lashes so they don't stick together. I have Clindamycin ointment for the sores on my toes and fingers as needed.,F,65,2  years150mg 1X D,4/8/2010Email,Tarceva
