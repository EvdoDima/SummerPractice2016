Dark heavy discharge which caused severe irritation,I have researched the side effects of this drug only after taking it. I wish that I had done so beforehand.

1, 4, Dryness and UTIs,I suspected weight gain may be a side effect. I've never had a weight issue before. I have developed a muffin top around my middle and I am exercising. Sure_ I could be exercising more than I do and eating fewer sweets. It may not be the Osphena_ but I'm not sure.,I am happy with the results of the Osphena other than my recent weight gain. I will have to look closer at what I'm eating and step up my exercise a bit and see if that helps.,F,53,90  days60mg 1X D,5/16/2016,Osphena
2, 5, UTIs and some dryness,No side effects,I had 3 UTIs in 5 months and some dryness even with lubricants. Since my doctor suggested trying osphena_ I haven't had anymore UTIs_ but I still use the lubricant.,F,62,6  months60mg 1X D,3/28/2016,Osphena
3, 2, ,After a week taking Osphena_ I started to experience abdominal pain and insomnia. However it did help somewhat my discomphort. After 10 days I noted also weight gain. I decided then to take it every other day. The abdominal pain went away but the pill not longer worked as previously. Now after a month_ I am looking for other options with less side effects.,,F,61,1  months1x D,3/16/2016,Osphena
4, 1, vaginal atrophy,WEIGHT gain,Very little improvement in atrophy. Weight gain is atrocious. I did not have food cravings. My usual routine for losing a few pounds put the weight on. NO MORE OSPHENA for me,F,62,3  months30 mg 1X D,3/9/2016,Osphena
5, 1, Painful intercourse,Increased appetite and weight gain,Not worth the side effects. Will try other solutions.,F,59,1  months60,12/28/2015,Osphena
6, 4, Vaginal Atrophy,Hot Flashes_ increased appetite (potential weight gain),Works as claimed for vaginal dryness_ with a side effect of eliminating stress incontinence for me.  BUT the hot flashes and increased appetite are big disadvantages.  I am considering discontinuing_ even though the desired effects are terrific.,F,55,21  days60 1X D,12/23/2015,Osphena
7, 5, Painful sex_ dryness_ UTI,Only had a few mild hot flushes but they diminished over about 3-4 weeks.  Nothing that bad.,I was having frequent UTI's after sex and had pain during intercourse even after using lubricants.  I was on Premarin before but did not like using the cream and had OK results.  When I first started on the product I used it everyday for 90 days.  After that I have been taking it 3 times per week and I have continued to have great results. My husband says it makes a difference in lubrication.  VERY HAPPY.,F,58,9  months60mg 1X D,10/2/2015Email,Osphena
8, 2, vaginal atrophy and painful sex,Weight gain,I am experiencing large weight gain. Almost 20 lbs. Have never been overweight. Very upsetting and depressing. DOES stop painful intercourse but weight now has me unable to look in the mirror.,F,55,  1X D,6/16/2015Email,Osphena
9, 3, vaginal atrophy,weight gain,Still too early to tell if it helps but I am already fairly convinced that it causes weight gain which is not listed as a side effect. Anyone else have this experience?,F,54,17  days 1X D,3/29/2015,Osphena

11, 3, dryness_ burning_ itching,Too early to tell_ but so far none,Wondering if there have been any comparisions to vaginal estrogen creams.  Used Estrace for 2 years and it definitely helped.  Just recently found Estrace not doing the job so now trying Osphena.  Wondering why no comments so far and see little out there in the way of patient reviews.  How does this compare with vaginal creams for anyone who has tried both?,F,62,7  days60 mg 1X D,7/21/2014,Osphena
