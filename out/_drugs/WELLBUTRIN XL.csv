1, 1, Depression,Tinnitis_ aggression_ high blood pressure_ mania_ fatigue_ decreased inhibitions_ increased pleasure seeking_ but worst of all_ withdrawal of treatment caused DPDR disorder.,"Wellbutrin seemed to help me at first. I was confident_ headstrong_ and motivated. I didn't see it at first_ but this was because of my new aggressive behavior. I stood up for myself when challenged. I had an ""alpha"" mentality. I made a lot of life changes that I had been afraid to initiate. I was fearless. However....this came at a price. I was mean. People were afraid to confront me. I started to get tired some time after increasing my dosage to 300mg daily. So_ I started to taper off the drug. I don't know what wellbutrin did to me_ but I had a serious case of depersonalization-derealization disorder for a whole year after coming off of it. It was a nightmare. The worst year of my life. I didn't feel like myself again until I started Adderall after a year and regained some cognitive function and sense of self.",M,27,4  months150 mg 1X D,5/9/2016Email,Wellbutrin xl
2, 1, Anxiety_ weight loss_ stop smoking,Racing heart rate_ anxiety_ tremor_ paranoia_ loss of appetite_ hot flashes.,I only took this for 3 days. The symptoms were so bad that I stopped. Everyone says to give it 2 weeks for the symptoms to pass but I couldn't do it. Doc prescribed to me mainly for weight loss and quitting smoking. They definitely do curb your appetite_ in fact_ you have no desire to eat which can be dangerous. I had to force feed myself and I could barely take a couple bites. I still had the urge to smoke so that didn't help_ and I can't say it helped with anxiety because the pharmacist said it would take a month to be fully effective. The tremor it gave me was awful. My finger and hand constantly shook and I felt like I had no strength in my arms and hands.,F,34,3  days150mg,5/8/2016,Wellbutrin xl

5, 5, Depression,"At the time I started taking Wellbutrin XL I was taking Prozac but felt I needed a little ""boost"". Psych Dr. added the Wellbutrin XL. I lost 5 to 10 pounds initially and found I wasn't ""grazing"" all day. Eventually weaned off the Prozac and have continued with the Wellbutrin XL.",My insurance company_ UHC_ refused to continue paying for the name brand as of January 2016. My Dr. will not prescribe the generic nor would I take it if he did. As someone else suggested_ Google the generic. What I've read is pretty frightening and the FDA is irresponsible in their decision to give drug companies the OK to continue providing these useless generics to unsuspecting patients. Direct Success Pharmacy works with the provider of the name brand. It's a very easy process to get the name brand through this avenue. Some patients may not have to pay for the drug while others pay 50 dollars for a months supply. Your Dr. can write a script for up to three months at a time. For what I pay in insurance premiums every month_ it's pretty crappy that insurers are allowed to make these decisions for subscribers. It's happening more and more unfortunately and with most insurers.,F,55,15  years300 mg 1X D,3/20/2016,Wellbutrin xl
6, 2, Depression_,,I switched from CELEXA (40mg) to Wellbutrin XL about 3 weeks ago. So far it has been really hard getting through the days. I slept the whole weekend because I was severely depressed. I have had 2 major fights with my boyfriend and have been easily irritated by people at work. I am usually a doormat that never stands up for myself; however on Wellbutrin XL I am a lion looking prey on anyone that gets in my way. Celexa caused me to gain about 45lbs over the course of a year and a half. Even with excessive exercise and dieting_ I was never able to lose even an ounce of weight. I started Wellbutrin because of the reviews I saw online for it. I wanted a drug that would not cause me to gain weight. I am hoping things get a lot better over time. I am hanging in there only because some people have stated that it gets worse before it ever get better. I am going to increase my dosage to 300mg ( request the psychiatrist to do so) and see what happens. I really want this drug to work for me. I was skinny and now I am obese and depressed. UPDATE: It has been exactly 1 month that I have been on wellbutrin.  I am taking the generic brand made by Global Pharmaceuticals.  I am experiencing a little bit of the appetite lose.  Yesterday I went the entire day without eating.  I began to feel hungry around 6pm last night.  I have just increased my dosage to 450mg per day.  I have been taking this dosage for 2 days.

I no longer binge eat/have the desire too which was a huge problem before. I don't have the urge to way myself multiple times a day like before and I hardly weigh myself now (once a week). I am also attending cognitive therapy to learn how to help myself. Whatever you do know there is help and that you can't go through life alone. You owe it yourself to be happy. I wish you the best and things WILL get better. I know it for a fact I was very suicidal for a few years and had no hope all it took was hope and medication to start my recovery process.,F,21,2  months150 mg,1/9/2016,Wellbutrin xl

If you are going to take Wellbutrin_ I HIGHLY recommend ONLY taking the brand name. There are known issues with the generics (Google and see for yourself).

10, 5, MDD_ digestion failing,Increased libido_ minor muscle twitching in upper extremities_ magnified emotional responses temporarily_ minor decreased typing proficiency.,Though started for Major Depression almost 2.5 years ago_ it fixed my concern I would slowly starve to death by restoring effectiveness of my digestive system to about 95% or better of what it had been up till 8 years ago when it slowly began to decline. After three months I had to add a second antidepressant to control depression_ but none of the others keeps my digestive system working like Wellbutrin.

11, 3, PTSD - major depression,Slight humming or ringing in my earsVision problems,Wellbutrin is about the only prescription drug I could tolerate without numerous side effects. I can't use SSRI's etc. Lately though my eyesight is becoming increasingly troublesome. I have developed cataracts and of course my age plays a part in this too. But I now have blurred vision_ sometimes double vision and pain in my left eye. My blood pressure has also increased. I also take Xanax and Ambien as needed. Have no idea what to try next but the vision problems are really scaring me.,F,66,3  years150 MG 1X D,12/7/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
12, 5, Depression_ ADD_ Anxiety,Jittery at first_ insomnia_ brain fog,I never thought I could take Wellbutrin because of anxiety but doctor asked me to stay on it at least six weeks. To my surprise the anxiety faded away_ and the insomnia turned into drowsiness so that now I take it at night. Please don't take the negative reviews to heart and give it at least 8 weeks before you decide (unless doc says otherwise.) I tried it once before and gave up too soon. I think my life would have been more productive in the meanwhile if I'd have stayed with it. Have lost weight and only persistent side effect is mild brain fog/memory issue_ but that is improving by the week. I am so glad I stuck with it.,F,55,4  months300 mg 1X D,11/30/2015,Wellbutrin xl

14, 5, Depression,When I started I had severe headaches for the first seven weeks.  At week 7 the headaches subsided and have never had any more side effects,I have been taking brand Wellbutrin for 30 years and it has been a life saver.  When the generic came out my pharmacist changed me from brand to generic and my depression symptoms returned.  I called my doctor and he said what took you so long to realize.  He said many of his patients were having similar problems.  All these years my insurance supplied me with the brand drug.  My drug plan notified me that January 1st they will no longer supply me with the brand name.  If I want the brand name it will cost me thousands of dollars.  I do not understand how a drug plan has the authority to switch a person to generic when the generic does not work.All antidepressants work for me but they all make me physically ill.  Wellbutrin was the only drug that resolved my depression with no physical side effects.,M,70,10  years450 mg,11/5/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
15, 5, Binge Eating Disorder_ BDD,Weight decreased,I lost 30 pounds so far with Wellbutrin. I absolutely love it. I'm the thinnest I have ever been and am now very close to a normal body weight for my height. It gave me the willpower that I needed to fight binge eating. It requires some effort on your part_ but the medication is a great aide. The only problem is that it doesn't work for my BDD. That's easily fixed_ though_ because my psychiatrist has added a different antidepressant along with Wellbutrin. Overall_ great experience.,F,17,7  months300 MG 1X D,10/24/2015,Wellbutrin xl
16, 5, Depression,"None! Absolutely none. Not a single one. Nada. I started taking Wellbutrin XL for depression last Spring_ although I've probably needed it for several years -- if not decades. I have been terrified to start on the Dreaded Anti-Depressant my entire life!!! TV commercials listing every possible side effect_ knowing that it takes time for these things to ""work_"" but that the side effects are immediate_ knowing that it's not easy to wean off of these meds if they don't work and having to start over with a different med_ and possible weight gain (so common with these meds) have prevented me from even considering such an option. Boy_ was I wrong! I have experienced the OPPOSITE of side effects with Wellbutrin XL. It has ""fixed"" everything that was ""wrong"" with me -- and not just the depression! I think I can (and probably should) write a book about it because it has absolutely and unexpectedly REVERSED some very uncomfortable Multiple Sclerosis symptoms!! I've h","Bottom Line: I am no longer depressed_ I have *virtually* no MS symptoms anymore (just minor issues_ as I still do *have* the disease)_ I did NOT gain weight (just the opposite -- I think I lost a few pounds)_ and my libido has never been stronger. The nickname for Wellbutrin is the ""Happy_ Horny_ Skinny Pill."" I would add ""Healthy"" to that list_ and welcome any medical professionals who would like to study my situation to see if it can help others with their MS symptoms.",F,50,1.5  years150mg 1X D,10/21/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl

The only this is the insomnia is terrible so I'm about to start taking it in the morning and see how that works!! Regarding the dizziness it's very slight and maybe could even be because of lack of sleep?? This medicine has given more more energy_ helped me with my severe anxiety_ & make me feel happier and helped me mend relationships with my family.

18, 5, Severe depression,Increased anxiety for the first month_ out of body sensation for the first month_ dry mouth to this day. Slight weight loss (10lbs in 12months) and increased sex drive that hasn't wavered.,"Wellbutrin saved my life. After years of being fearful of taking antidepressants (I was worried I would lose myself) I finally caved after developing suicidal ideation and becoming fixated on death and obsessive negative thoughts. I can say it took my AT LEAST 8 weeks before I felt my depression subside_ but when it finally did_ it really did. I have never felt so ""normal"" in my life. I no longer am consumed with sadness and I no longer desire to seek out sadness. It's amazing!",F,23,1  years150 mg,9/21/2015,Wellbutrin xl
19, 5, Anxiety_ ADHD_ Depression,Irritability_ dry mouth,After cancer treatment anxiety kicked in which was affecting my business. Depression then set in because my business was suffering. My fiance a registered nurse was concerned and also she noticed I had signs and symptoms of ADHD and I was undiagnosed my entire life and it all made sense why I was always doing different things and could not sit still in school. When I started the med the first 3 days I was irritable and in a flat out rage screaming at people while I was driving and so forth. But then_ suddenly it went away and I have not had any anxiety or rage. My depression...gone. It helped my ADHD a great deal. I can concentrate and organize my thoughts which has made me more productive and able to focus on my business again. I have not been on this med for me but it is working and my only side effect is dry mouth but I need to drink more water anyway. I hope my experience helps you but remember everyone is different and talk to your doctor.,M,31,1  months,9/14/2015,Wellbutrin xl
20, 3, Depression,SHORT period of insomnia.  Exhaustion.  Excellent sex drive.,First_ the very good thing: I am much more interested in sex.  That was a big problem on Prozac.  Side effect wise_ I had insomnia for literally only like 2-3 days on 150mg.  Dosage raised to 300mg_ insomnia still did not return.  But my chief problem right now is being absolutely exhausted.  I have weened off 2mg Abilify and 60mg Prozac when starting this_ so my body might just be really confused right now.  But overall I'm disappointed because I thought Wellbutrin was going to make me not be fatigued_ be more energetic... I also seem to be gaining weight which I didn't expect. It's been two and a half weeks (sorry for writing a review so soon) so I hope in like another month everything will even out with the energy/motivation.,M,27,18  days300 mg 1X D,9/14/2015,Wellbutrin xl
21, 4, GAD/depression,I experienced loss of appetite_ some nausea but more concerning was the itching. Severe itching that I just couldn't take it anymore.

22, 2, depression_ adhd,I had severe nerve pain in my hand when on Wellbutrin XL.  After exercising_ after eating_ when hot and especially when cold_ my thumb would throb and hurt until sometimes I couldn't do anything but rock back and forth until the pain subsided.  Several especially bad times_ I also felt the pain in the tip of my forefinger_ and sometimes the tip of my middle finger.,The pain was generally localized to under the back left corner of my thumbnail on the right hand.  The pain started a month after taking Wellbutrin_ and I asked all my doctors and they said it couldn't be caused by it.  Well_ after taking Wellbutrin for 2 years and during two surgeries to fix the thumb pain_ I've finished the Wellbutrin and the pain has significantly subsided.  The pain before was up to 6s and 7s (with 9 being splitting my head open in a car accident)_ the pain is currently reaching a 3 at max and mostly just 1s and 2s.  The pain now could just be all the scar tissue from the surgeries!  This is on the internet now so if others are looking they'll know it could happen!

23, 1, depression_ in a drug combo,I thought I was experiencing a dramatic shift towards menopause. I had 3 heavier periods in 2 months both with severe outbreaks of hormonal rosasea_nausea_extreme sweating-- ended up in the ER with dehydration_ irritability and a worsening hypersensitivity to sound; it did increase my libido_ but that wasn't enough of a perk. I just recently stopped taking it.,I'd been on wellbutrin about 12 years ago.

It's been working great_ I take it at night. Unlike most people is sedating. So I take it at night_  the dry mouth_  sleepiness is worth it to me. The other ones killed my libido and having been married a year and a half it was either suffer from SAD all winter or take this.  If you have issues with the generic is the time release mechanism. Read about the FDA recall it's not bogus. Something isn't right with generic Wellbutrin Xl. I pay fifty bucks out of pocket but it makes a difference.

26, 2, Depression,Dry mouth_ anxiety (only in the beginning)_ weight loss_ loss of appetite_ tinnitus_ dizziness_ worsening of migraines_ bad taste in mouth_ increased sex drive,This medication does make you lose weight; however_ this side effect eventually went away.  I was already at a healthy weight when I began using this medication_ and I let myself get complacent about my diet and exercise_ so when the weight loss side effect went away_ I gained about 20 lbs in a short amount of time.  I recommend anyone taking this drug to continue being cautious about what you eat and how much you exercise.  The ringing in my ears and dizziness was pretty bad.  Those side effects never went away.  The medication seems to help my mood more on a short-term basis.  It increased my sex drive to the point that it was kind of annoying.  One thing about this medication that I really do not like is that it seems to increase the amount of migraines I get.,F,38,2  years300 mg 1X D,7/5/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
27, 5, Anxiety_ depression,I have taken this medication on and off for the last 3 years. I was treated with opiates for a severe car accident. One day I realized the opiates were making my brian mush_ and destroying my attention span_ so I attempted to stop taking the opiates. Little did I know the horrors of opiate detox. Once again_ I started taking wellbutrin at my doctors urging. It was a life saving drug for me. For me_ (maybe from the opiate detox period) the Wellbutrin worked great the first few days with an immediate marked difference_ the second week was rough_ but the third week an on was miraculous. I still cannot believe the difference. I have a terrible back and fibro. This medication along with a CNS suppresent like Horizant has killed all of my pain. I want to cry now thinking about what it took to get where I am today_ 100% pain free. Please people_ don't rely on opiates alone. There is good medication such as this that doesn't have the risks as opiates do. Eventually opiates actually made me hurt MORE due to long term use. I NEVER abused mine in the slightest_ it is just a side effect of long term use. The wellbutrin gave me my life back_ both from depression_ anxiety_ and opiate withdrawal. I really hope that physicians see these reviews and can recommend this drug to those going through opiate WD.,,F,36,3  years300,6/9/2015,Wellbutrin xl

My attention span has been just as bad if not worst then before_ I find myself daydreaming and jumping from task to task just as before only difference is now I have more anxiety when I'm trying to focus a task. I feel like this drug is just a safe med for doctors to give patients seeking help for ADHD so they don't have to actually dig into diagnosing you.this drug doesn't have any major harmful side effects and is non additive so its perfect for a doctor to prescribe out to quiet someone up.

I thought it worked extremely well. For some reason_ I am not taking to it the same as before. This go around is way different and not on a positive note. My period is a month late_  I always have to pee_ I'm constipated_ always tired but can't sleep for a full night and constantly paranoid. I don't know why I'm reacting differently but I'm not enjoying it. I'll give it a bit of a longer trial run and if it continues than I am quitting Wellbutrin XL.,F,21,3  weeks150 Mg,3/8/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
44, 4, generalised anxiety disorder_ insom,Doctor started me on Zoloft because the anxiety and panic attacks triggered a depressive state. After a month of taking it_ I realised that my motivation had decreased dramatically and I started making mistakes at work The Zoloft also caused daytime drowsiness. Tried taking morning_ then evening. No improvement in insomnia. Cut dosage in half_ then took alternate days only and felt motivation improved but insomnia Persiste. The doctor then switched me to Wellbutrin. At first did not notice anything in terms of being more alert at night but about 5 or 6 hours after taking it_ wave of calm would come over me and make me very drowsy. Some improvement in insomnia if I took it later in the Day. Did not know that alcohol cannot be taken with it as it is potentially threatening_ drank beer in the evenings and slept like a log. Now that I know it cannot be taken with alcohol I am not sure whether Wellbutrin induced sleep or whether it was the alcohol that induced sleep as its effects are magnified. Also noticed a slight increase in appetite. Should I be concerned with paradoxical effects of Wellbutrin? Has anyone's doctor advised ceasing Wellbutrin as a result of these effects? Don't feel emotionally blunted as with SSRIs. Friends have commented how well I look and they're no longer complaining I'm flippant and distant. If this works for sleep_ it  is a good drug. Reduced craving for nicotine.,,F,30,9  days150 mg,3/7/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
45, 5, Depression,Slight ringing in my ears but because of the benefits_ I can tolerate it.,The generic forms DO NOT work for me; I have to take the brand name. This is the only drug that is successfully treating my depression and allowing me to live a normal happy life. I wish the FDA would re-evaluate the generic brands - the coatings on them are all over the place so I would usually get a full blast of the drug after 2 hours_ then nothing for the rest of the day (the coatings did not allow for extended release). I ended up almost killing myself while on the generics.,F,54,6  years300 1X D,2/22/2015,Wellbutrin xl

47, 4, to get off of paxil,nausea_ insomnia_ more energy_ ringing in the ears.,I have been on Paxil 10 mg._ for 16 years.  I have gained 50 pounds and feel like a slug.  I have tried to withdraw from this drug numerous times_ with the help of my dr_ but was never successful_ due to the horrible withdrawal symptoms.  In the past_ I never used Wellbutrin_ to transition from Paxil to Wellbutrin.  My Dr. suggested it this time_ due to the weight gain. I have had only had one horrible day and night of the Paxil flu.  I am now off of Paxil_ two weeks and think it has left my system.  Please listen to this big news_ because in the past I have never been able to get off of Paxil_ but never used Wellbutrin to help me.  I have the beginning side effects of Wellbutrin 150 lx_ but I am sure they will go away with time.  My other siblings use this medication and it works for them.  We are all genetically disposed to depression_ since my Father suffered from it.  I so hope that I can get through these beginning stages with this medication and get back to normal.,F,71,2  weeks150xl 1X D,2/21/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
48, 5, DEPRESSION,Dry mouth_dizziness in first 2 months_ increased anxiety_ tremor (still to this day) less desire to eat-but will if SO puts it in front of me_ increase in alcohol consumption-due to increase in anxiety_ libido was nuts at first(pardon the pun) but has subsided to normal now_ easily ticked off to the point i don't talk to my dad anymore_ lowered inhibitions_ yelled at SO first time since we met 7 years ago_ energy boost-desire to do things now_ high increase in social anxiety_ increased heart rate(105bpm)_ awesome dreams which seem very real,I had been on this drug 12 years ago when going through a bitter divorce and then quit cold turkey with no problems. Went to doc in May of 2013_ and he prescribed me 300 xl with no titration.  My hands shook so bad i couldn't write if i tried. Never had any insomnia or nausea as others have said_ but most of the side effects have subsided now. The increase in anxiety has caused me to drink more_ as the alcohol relaxes me. I am going to go to doc next week and try and give Buspar a go. I have tried Celexa and just recently Lexapro(10mg) which the side effects were just too hard to want to go through my life with-since the very day I took it_ no sex drive at all. I still have not had sex for 6 months_ so hoping desire comes back soon as it is creating tension at home. I am also taking this with Concerta(36mg) for ADD and now motivation and energy are very good. I did notice a massive increase in libido in the first 5 months_ but that has toned down(argh) to the point that I'm not obsessed anymore. With all the side effects listed_ the question might come up as to why I would rate this so high. The fact is I FEEL GOOD. The vivid dreams are so real_ I have to ask SO the next day if I said something previously or did I dream it. I also find that alot of detail is remembered the next day- and some are stupid but entertaining.,M,58,1.5  years300mg 1X D,2/20/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
49, 2, depression,"Constant Yawning_ felt like I couldnt get a deep enough breath_ fatigue and dizziness later in the day. Could not tolerate  so I went back to an SSRI as buproprion is an ""atypical"" antidepressant which does not help with seratonin... back to fluoxetine....",,F,45,2  weeks150 xr 1X D,2/18/2015,Wellbutrin xl
50, 3, Low energy_ minor depression,None detected. I don't eat well_ use recreationally here and there_ and generally don't take care of myself. Nothing I deal with is Wellbutrin related and if it is it is very mild.,Take in am. Noticeable increased energy especially in morning. Strong coffee really ratchets that up. Skip lunch occasionally. That high energy disappears once I'm home from work with the kids. Exhausted. Damn kids. Hasn't done anything for depression. Found out I have low-t and started andogel 5 days ago. Not feeling anything from that. Doing both now per doc. He acts like the planets will align in a couple months. I'm doubtful_ but willing to try. Might have to ask for some Viagra and triple up!!,,40,4  months300 MG 1X D,2/15/2015,Wellbutrin xl
51, 2, Anxiety,24/7 Heart palpitations_ couldn't sleep a full night without waking up multiple times_ dry mouth.,I started taking this to help with weight loss because of the weight I gained on Paxil and to help my sex drive which I lost also because of Paxil.  It did help with both of those but my anxiety got really bad and I had horrible heart palpitations constantly.  I haven't had caffeine in over 8 years because of my heart being a bit sensitive and I quit smoking almost 2 years ago so it wasn't those things causing the palpitations.  I ended up back on the Paxil and have been off Wellbutrin for 4 days and I finally slept my first full night last night in over 2 months and I feel my palpitations lessening each day.  I'm sure this can work for some people but definitely not for someone with severe anxiety and any heart sensitivity.,F,35,2  months150 1X D,2/11/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
52, 2, Anxiety and insomnia,Went directly from lexapro_ which was a complete disaster...anxiety_ shaking panic to wellbutrin. I'm only on day 6 of wellbutrin. Still anxious_ insomnia_ nausea_ comstipation. It's hard to evaluate the Wellbutrin right now not only because it only been a week but because I'm wondering if I'm suffer WD from lexapro. Had to go cold turkey due to a terrible reaction. Really wanting this medication to work but so far nothing but negatives.,,F,58,6  days150 1X D,2/8/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl

54, 1, anxiety_ depression,Insomnia_ dizziness_ hives!!_ depression,I really wanted this drug to work but once I connected my itchy hives to the drug it was clear I needed to stop.  I also noticed myself becoming much more agitated_ irritated with everyone. The insomnia didn't subside either.  The worst part other than the hives was the sinking depression I wound up in_ and now I'm trying to dig out of.  My doctor told me thehives weren't connected to WB because they happened 2 weeks into usage_ but after online research it is clear there is a strong correlation.  I am using the generic Buproprion but I dont even want to try the brand name.  I just want this crap out of my system.,F,35,2  months150,1/12/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
55, 2, severe panic attacks and insomnia,racing heart_ increased anxiety_ nausea_muscle aches_difficulty concentrating_ extreme fatigue,This medicine did help somewhat with the negative thoughts I was having as I could not keep any thoughts in my head for more than a moment so could not obsess about anything_ panic attacks were a little easier to manage at first even though I was more nervous feeling but then started getting much worse and lasting longer. The longer I took it the more tired I was during the day but unable to relax or sleep. I was able to fall asleep and pretty much stay asleep at night better than before but awoke every morning around 5 am_ regardless of when I fell asleep the night before. Still extremely emotional during menstrual cycle.,F,49,20  days150 1X D,1/2/2015,Wellbutrin xl

Feel lethargic and still don't feel like joining the world.,I've been on 20mg of Celexa for 8 years for anxiety.  I recently became severely depressed over 2 months ago.  I checked myself in New Horizons and Doc gave me 50mg of Wellbutrin and upped my Celexa to 40mg.  I'm afraid to up the Wellbutrin_ due to the possibility of anxiety attacks.  I still feel the same_ except I am not crying from morning until night.
