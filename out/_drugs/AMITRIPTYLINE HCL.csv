0, 1, Migraines_ insomnia_ anxiety,Increased hunger_ more frequent headaches_ more frequent anxiety attacks. Next day fatigue.,I have never been so hungry in my life than on this medication. I constantly eat and once I'm done almost immediately feel hungry again. Gained weight in very short amount of time. It doesn't  necessarily make me sleep better or longer but the next day o cannot seem to wake up and feel exhausted all day long. Also I have noticed my anxiety is heightened and I'm in a constant state of fear. and since taking it I've had a headache every single day. Not as bad as a migraine so I guess that's a plus but pretty annoying headaches that still disrupt my day to day. Will be working to wean off this med. No relief at all .,F,24,2  weeks10mg.,8/3/2016Email,Amitriptyline hcl
1, 5, Chronic complicated  migraines,initially gained about 10 pounds when started because of increased hunger _ but was able to lose the weight over the course of the year by reducing carb intake,This medication gave me my life back ! Was getting complicated migraines with vertigo _ visual auras and severe nausea 3-4 x week _ came close to having to resign from my nursing job . Side effects well worth it for me _ now I only get migraines during menstrual cycle that require only Aleve or Tylenol . Completely able to stop taking imitrex _ on 50 mg X1 year .,F,45,1  years50mg,7/13/2016,Amitriptyline hcl

5, 1, Headaches,Dizziness_ lethargy_ and almost blacking out.,I was given this medication to help headaches_ but instead I slept for 14 hours straight after taking the first dose. Felt very lethargic after waking up and almost blacked out while standing.,F,,2  days 1X D,7/13/2015,Amitriptyline hcl
6, 1, migraines,It seemed to be the ONLY med that helped my migraines however i was not informed of the weight gain. Had convinced myself i was having a baby due to all the weight gained and cravings. the only time i had ever felt that way was 11yrs ago with my son. After not missing my cycle and not having a pos test i started thinking of what was knew in my life started looking around i went from 123lbs to 140lbs in less then 2 mnths. I will no longer take it as of today and see if my weight and appetite goes back to normal,Its sad that i had this effect. it has been the best thing ive found in yrs that helped my chronic migraines,F,32,7  months75mg 1X D,5/16/2015Email,Amitriptyline hcl
7, 5, Depression and anxiety,Dry mouth_ fatigue,I have tried Lexapro_ Prozac_ and Wellbutrin for my depression_ and Amitriptyline is hands down the best.  I am taking it for depression and anxiety_ but it has also eliminated any digestive issues I previously had.  I also struggled with little appetite for many years and I could not gain weight.  This drug has fixed that too and now I eat what I feel to be a more appropriate amount for my height.  It has been extremely helpful for anxiety and calming racing thoughts.  It takes atleast a month to notice improvement in depression_ but it has certainly been working.  This drug saved my life.  Also_ it didn't affect my libido like the other_ newer meds did.  You will often read that drugs like Amitriptyline have many side effects compared to the newer medications_ but I have found the opposite to case.  I think a lot of the side effects are amplified by the companies trying to sell the newer drugs.,M,25,2  months100 mg,5/1/2015,Amitriptyline hcl

10, 1, ,It made me feel like I was crazy_ I would get sporadic wiggling sensations in my left eye_ making me feel as if a worm was in there. I would just sit there with a mirror trying to find a fictional worm in my eye.,Needless to say I've stopped taking this drug. For Insomnia it work extremely well. But the side effect was a deal breaker.,F,19,4  days25 MG 2X AN,4/3/2015Email,Amitriptyline hcl

12, 1, Chronic Migraines/ Anxiety,Rapid Weight Gain_ Uncontrollable Hunger_ Nausea_ Thirst_ Sleeplessness,When I started taking this medication_ I was hoping to help my migraines. It didn't even TOUCH them. All I experienced from it was the side effects. I gained almost 10 pounds in 1 MONTH! I was starving all the time!! Seriously_ I ate everything in sight and I had cravings for things I don't normally eat. On top of the hunger_ I was nauseous. So strange. I was thirsty all the time_ it would wake me up after i fought so hard to fall asleep. I was miserable to be around_ per my husband. I do not recommend this medication.,F,27,2  months30 1X D,3/17/2015,Amitriptyline hcl

14, 4, Chronic Migraines,weight gain (13 lbs)_ sleepiness_ and no more depression (even though that was not why I was on it.),I went from 18 migraine days a month to 6 - 8. And now that I am going through menopause_ they are even less. But when I do get them sometimes they can be so bad_ I can't stop throwing up. I think I end up in urgent care at least 6 or more times a year to stop the vomiting.,F,50,3  years50 MG 1X D,2/22/2015,Amitriptyline hcl
15, 3, Insomnia_ depression_ anxiety.,Constipation_ fatigue_ carb cravings_ tinnitus worsening_ hands numbness while running_ waking up not feeling well rested.,I have been prescribed this med (along bromazepam) because severe anxiety episode accompanied with insomnia and depression.  Only take the pills 2 hours before bed and the bromazepan at bed time. The dosage was increased night after night till 25mg. Even thought this med helped me sleep_ I had various waking during the night. I quit the amytriptiline because extreme fatigue and hands numbness while training (running). My doc then change the prescription to Nortriptiline that I think that is a light version of Amitriptiline.,M,39,15  days10mg 1X D,5/22/2014Email,Amitriptyline hcl
16, 3, chronic headaches migraines,immediately had a significant reduction in headaches which was great.  Gained about 8 pounds and could not take it back off no matter what I did.  Also_ started having increased symptoms related to my restless leg syndrome.  I looked up the side effects of the med and found many other people also had weight gain while taking.  I tried taking half a pill per my drs suggestion and the headaches were worse.  Now its a struggle between crippling headaches without the pill or weight gain with it.,,F,36,8  months25 mg 1X D,2/23/2014Email,Amitriptyline hcl
17, 4, Chronic Migraines,When I first started taking the medication it made me sleepy_ but after two weeks that went away and I have had no problems since. I take this at night and I take 20MG Inderal in the morning. Between this combination_ my migraines are well under control.,,F,50,6  years50MG 1X D,1/16/2014Email,Amitriptyline hcl
18, 3, Chronic migraines,I've been on & off amitriptyline for 11yrs as needed for migraines_ mainly just taking  when an attack is bad enough that I need to sleep it off. I have always had severe mood swings and irritability on it if I take the pills for more than a few days. I never knew this was a sign of severe reaction. Over time the medicine has also lost its effectiveness at making me sleep and I'm lucky if I fall asleep for even an hour after taking a pill. Time to find something else. However I do hear that for most people this drug works wonders just not for me.,,F,27,1  days25 mg,2/23/2013,Amitriptyline hcl
19, 4, Insomnia_ depression,Extremely dry mouth (but I am also on other meds that cause this)_ drowsy waking up_ fainting/ dizziness upon getting up (although again I am also on Propranolol and Fluoxetine which have the same effect).,Overall this has been a great drug for me_ helping me sleep where before I could not get to sleep at all and lifting my mood. I do find it difficult to wake up on a morning occasionally_ but other times I wake up hyper from it! I do have a lot of dry mouth_ and there have been times where I have fainted upon getting up- but now I know to sit or stand up slowly and sit/ lie back down if I feel dizzy or faint. I have also been given Salivix pastilles (Natural Salivary Stimulant) by my pharamacist and they really help combat dry mouth_ so if anybody suffers from that side effect I would recommend them.,F,19,8  months100 MG 1X D,11/24/2012Email,Amitriptyline hcl
20, 5, insomnia headaches nervous stomach,Occured drowsiness(good)_ a little groggy when first wake up in mornings(but goes away in about 1/2 hr). This has been a miracle for me! It has helped with body aches and my tension headaches a great deal. I also have urinary pain and difficulty and this also seems to be helping with that too! Love this drug and would highly reccomend it. I take only 1tab nightly but thinking about tlking to dr about maybe a lower mg for during daytime usage for help with my symptoms,,F,31,4  months100,10/8/2012,Amitriptyline hcl

22, 5, migraines/complicated migraines,Dry mouth and sometimes helps you sleep.   Went from 1 to 2 a week down to maybe I feel one coming on every other month so I take 2 and maybe a midol complete (midol complete was only thing that ever touched them before....Tried a few others_ one made me so dizzy and nauseous all the time and the other made me projectile vomit about a half hour after taking.  The Amitriptyline has been like a miracle cure!!  ,,F,46,3  years25 mg 1X D,1/27/2012Email,Amitriptyline hcl

24, 2, Migraines with aura; milddepression,Extreme carb cravings and accompanying weight gain; made migraines with aura become much more frequent.,Worked OK for depression_ but the dramatically increased frequency of my aura migraines was scary!

25, 3, Migraines,Slept through the night but very vivid dreams_ but no nightmares yet. Controlled migraines_ but hard to concentrate during the day_ wake up feeling very tired and groggy_ even confused. Just want to sleep all day if I could. Felt like I was in a cloud all day. Husband says I'm more irritable and just not myself. Slight memory loss.,"Doctor started me off on 10MG every night but after three months of taking it the migraines started getting worse_ so she increased it to 25MG. I gave this drug a 3 because although it works for the migraines which is great_ but the side effects are starting to interfere with my daily routine and work ability.

27, 3, Sleep disorders,Extreme mental fog and fatigue the next day.,I may be more sensitive to this drug. I was prescribed 25mg at bedtime_ and I find if I take a full tab I have to take it hours before I fall asleep. Even when I do take the full tab hours before bed_ the next day I often feel foggy and spaced out_ and ready to nap the next evening. If I take a half-tab an hour or two before bed_ the next-day fog isn't quite as bad_ but it's still noticeable. I do not take this drug nightly_ more like a few times a week or less. The fog I get the next day_ however_ is why I rate the drug lower in satisfaction. -- My actual sleep under this drug is all right_ but heavy_ not necessarily refreshing. And I find that I need to sleep longer (min. 9 hours) when taking this drug_ or I'm too groggy to function much at all the next day.,F,52,1.5  years,1/3/2010,Amitriptyline hcl
28, 1, headaches/migraines/depression,I developed a horrible temper/attitude_ I started feeling extremely violent & moody.,This drug from what I've experienced and heard from friends and my fiance that have also taken it have all experienced the same side effect I have_ I don't think I could recommend this drug to anybody just because I wouldn't want to risk anyone having the same side effects.,,19,7  days,10/21/2009,Amitriptyline hcl

32, 4, chronic migranes,weight gain_ sleepiness,I suffered from migranes every other day for about a month. Dr put me on Topamax. It worked for a month or so_ reducing the migranes to once a week and I lost weight_ which was OK. Dr. changed to amitriptyline_ and while I have a migrane maybe once a month now_ i gained about 5-8 lbs.

Only other side effect is a dry mouth.,After 30 years of horrendous pain with severe migraine lasting anything up to 5 days at a time this is a miracle drug and life began for me at 50.  I still have the occasional attack but now only last 24 hours and usually due to eating something I am allergic to which is my own fault.,F,65,15  years,5/23/2006Email,Amitriptyline hcl
35, 4, sleeplessness i guess,got to sleep kept me asleep for ages,ordered some of these tablets off the internet because i had a friend who took an overdose of these and apparently tricylic anti depressants are really dangerous so be carefull. i found that taking three a night knocked me out for about 20 hours which was useful at the time because i didnt want to cope with anything. just be careful taking these. it helped me but not in the right way. it doesnt suit everyone,F,19,3  weeks,4/3/2006,Amitriptyline hcl

38, 3, chronic tension headaches,Weight gain,"It tastes gross! Very bitter - I'm used to taking small pills without water_ but this one I couldn't because I'd cringe everytime! Also_ it did help my headaches somewhat_ but I also have generalized anxiety disorder_ so my psychiatrist suggested I stop the amitriptyline altogether and go for another anitdepressant more suited for anxiety. He also mentioned that amitriptyline is what he calls a ""dirty"" drug_ meaning that in addition to affecting the serotonin and norepinephrine synapses in the brain_ it also affects the histamine response (hence the drowsiness) and has anticholinergic properties_ which he attributes to causing the weight gain. I gained about 5 lbs in the 2 months I was on it_ and I was only on 10 mg the first month_ 20 mg the second month. I would hate to see what happened as I increased my dosage! Needless to say_ I'm stopping the amitriptyline and beginning the new antidepressant.",F,23,2  months,1/13/2006,Amitriptyline hcl
