0, 3, lower back pain,Constipation,I am dealing with extreme lower back pain due to arthritis of the lumbar spine and cervical spine_ i also deal with fibromyalgia and plantar fascitis. From a pain level 1 to 10 i only get some relief with meds the morphine in combination with norco 4x a day and lyrica twice a day and amitriptyline once at bed time i only experience a pain at a level 6 and 7. I didnt take them one morning and i couldnt move i was in so much pain i was crying and all due to miscommunication. Finally took the meds and after and hour i was able to get up and get ready for work. I have pain_ numbness_ tingling_ swealling_ and very minimal pain relief. Today i was asleep most of the day and woke up by the pain i was feeling and an extreme hot feeling in my back_ i also experience several bowel movements in a matter of minutes and sudden hot flashes and chills accompanied with cold sweats went to work but unable to perform i went home only to realized i might have been experiencing some type of withdrawal since it was 4pm and id yet not taken a single dose of any of my meds and still wonder if that was possible from missing a dosage and why didnt i experience pain other than flu like symptoms. I dont know... I have lots of questions_ im writing them down for my doc visit on the 15th,F,36,2  months15mg,12/26/2015Email,Duramorph pf
