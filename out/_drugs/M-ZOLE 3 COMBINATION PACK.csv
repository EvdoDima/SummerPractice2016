0, 1, ,"I've had yeast infections before and used various inserts before with no real problems. It seemed like I was getting a yeast infection and I thought I'd better treat it before it got worse. Well_ this time my body's reaction to the medicine was different. I used Miconazole 3 a store brand_ but same as Monistat 3. The first night_ I inserted the medicine and then after several hours I felt burning and itching inside me and couldn't sleep. I used the external cream_ but that didn't seem to help. After about 4 hours_ it got better. On the morning of Day 2_ I noticed a tiny smear of blood and wondered if maybe somehow I scraped myself when I used the plastic applicator. I read the information sheet and it says ""a mild increase in vaginal burning_ itching or irritation may occur"" so I thought that's all it was and the medicine was working. Like an idiot_ I used the medicine again on Night #2. O-M-G. The burning and itching started shortly after putting the medicine in and was so i","After reading the info on this website_ I now know it's not my period_ it's my body's reaction to this horrible medicine.   I won't be taking the third dose tonight! My body's reaction to the medication is worse than the symptoms of the yeast infection.  How can this medicine still be on the market if it gives so many of us such horrible side effects??? They say ""a mild increase"" etc. HA_ that's no mild increase in itching and burning. The box needs to address the very real possibility of reactions like MAJOR intense FIRE and significant swelling. I don't know if I should take Benadryl to counteract the swelling...? Sigh. I'm climbing back in bed for another nap_ if I can.",F,47,2  days,6/10/2008,M-zole 3 combination pack
