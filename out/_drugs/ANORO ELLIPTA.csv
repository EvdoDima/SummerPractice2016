0, 1, COPD,Anoro was prescribed to improve my breathing. It didn't improve my breathing. After about 8 days on it I had such severe muscle and joint aches and pain and such severe leg cramps I could barely walk and felt prone to falling. As it was not helping my breathing I quit taking it because of the side effects.,,M,73,10  days30 mg 1X D,5/2/2015,Anoro ellipta
