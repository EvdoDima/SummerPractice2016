1, 1, high blood pressure,This med has caused severe sleep problems.  REM sleep occurs at least 4 times a night_ after which I am wide awake with problems going back to sleep.

4, 2, High BP,redness & itching under patch eventually progressed to generalized allergic reaction,"My doc prescribed ""Nasacort"" spray to reduce the itching under the patch_ which worked fairly well for about 1-1/2 years. Then the skin reaction got worse and the area stayed red even after patch was removed. Eventually I got a rash that spread from chest to back to arms & legs--entire body. It went away within 4 days after I stopped using the patch & switched to a different BP med.",F,50,2  years,2/17/2008,Catapres-tts-1

6, 2, ADHD,None,Was an early step in trying to treat our son's ADHD symptoms.  This one was so mild it didn't do much of anything.  The positive was little risk of side effects and nothing too scary as far as side effects_ but it just didn't do anything for ADHD.  Increased the dose to the max and still no results.  Have since moved on to the pure ADHD meds_ rather than blood pressure meds with other uses.,M,4,6  months,7/3/2007,Catapres-tts-1
7, 4, High blood pressure,Fatigue_ loss of vitality_ drive_ ambition_ and energy.,I have tried other medications for high blood pressure_ but their side affects were completely intolerable.
