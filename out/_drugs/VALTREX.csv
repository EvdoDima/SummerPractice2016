0, 1, Genital Herpes,Devastating Depression,Most horrible drug I have ever taken. Within a few day I started to experience extreme depression. When I stopped the drug the depression has lasted for years. While I have no proof it affects or causes long term depression_ I am positive it was the cause of my initial depression. Please so not take this drug!,M,61,5  days1 g 1X D,7/25/2016Email,Valtrex
1, 1, Suspected Genital Herpes,Started medication at 1230pm yesterday and wiithin two hours of first dose severe tingling/stinging started in exterior vaginal area (inner labia majora - the totality of the soft tissue burns/tingles/stings). After second dose last night the soft tissue inside my mouth had exactly the same symptoms and the symptoms in my genitals worsened significantly. Hershey's milk chocolate actually BURNED my mouth like it was a jalapen?o.... I Havent eaten a single thing since --it's the next day_ now.  I will NOT be continuing this medication!,I had zero herpes symptoms/diagnosis and went to doc yesterday for BV test which was positive. At that time the doc noticed a lesion and took a sample with a swab and it Hurt like hell. That was the only time I was aware it was there and the pain stopped immediately.  I didn't start my Rx until 4 hours after the swab and had zero symptoms until two hours AFTER taking it.. During my research many people have denied Valtrex has this effect_ I assure you_ IT DOES!  The blood work and swab results haven't come back yet but I'm giving the doc the benefit of the doubt.  I have no idea which type I have (HSV1 or 2) or how long I've had it since I had lesions that didn't itch or hurt until she sampled it. My only symptoms were bacterial infection or yeast infection related.  My husband has HSV1 so I suspect I got it from him. We have been together for 15 years.  I will let this virus run its course naturally_ I can barely sit down because the burning/stinging is SO SEVERE,F,42,7  days1000MG 2X D,4/29/2016,Valtrex

7, 5, HSVI/II,Periodic GI disruption.,"I am a healthcare practitioner and am writing to encourage patients to try Valtrex if recommended.  It is a very safe and effective drug.  Understand that replies to forums such as this are often only submitted by those who are dissatisfied.  Most of the negative reactions I've read are those of the virus_ not necessarily the drug.  Find out for yourself!  I have many patients who never knew suppression therapy existed for ""cold sores_"" HSVI. It can be life changing!  Though you can still infect others on suppression therapy_ with Valtrex I have no outbreaks and my partner remains HSV free!

25, 1, Suppressive therapy for cold sores,This an update to my original post on 12/30/13. All of my many symptoms resolved within approximately 1 month of discontinuing; however_ I have permanent joint damage in my right foot_ which still causes pain. About a year ago_ I attempted taking a dose to clear a cold sore and the return of symptoms was immediate. I haven't taken them since and won't. I've found that_ once my body no longer was dependent on this drug_ my own natural immunity strengthened. It took a few months. Now_ I take 1000 mg of Lysine twice daily. I just happened to think of updating my original post today. I hope it is helpful to someone and saves you the frightening experience I went through.,,F,43,2  years,8/16/2015Email,Valtrex

27, 3, shingles,I experienced swelling of my stomach after the 3rd pill on the first day.  Awful stomach ache and terrible gas pains that were stuck in my stomach continued to get worse.  Mild Nausea_ diarrhea in the a.m. and constipation in the p.m. with an urgency to go_ fatigue_ muscle twitching which was mild after the first day.  I made it through day 6 and only took one pill on day seven.  Doc. told me to the just toss the final two pills.  It has been 48 hours and the pain and gas is there but subsiding and I hope it continues to get better because these were awful side effects!,The Valtrex did reduce the shingles outbreak significantly so I guess it did its job but not without creating another problem...Both my shingles pain and my rash were tolerable on the drug but my stomach was out of control!,F,33,7  days1GM 3X D,6/12/2015,Valtrex

31, 4, HSV2,Never had side effects before. Always take one pill when I first start to feel funny like an OB coming on. Then another about 8 hours later then another 8 hours later. Those 3 usually nip it in the bud and prevent an OB from ever coming to fruition. This time however I started getting a spotty rash on my chest. It doesn't itch. Just very blotchy. Took one in PM 2 days ago and one in AM and one in PM yesterday (my usual 3) and both today and yesterday I woke up with these splotches. I don't recommend taking this or any other medication directly before bed.,Other than that to prevent an OB it works really well. I just try to use it as a last resort and keep my immune system up so I don't let the virus in. Smoking is the number one OB causer for me as well as around the time of my period. Don't smoke around the time of your period or you're asking for it. Lots of sleep and vitamins and hopefully you won't have to take Valtrex at all. Last resort ONLY.,F,26,4  years500MG 1X O,4/9/2015,Valtrex

I took one that night and one on Tuesday morning and have been nonfunctional since. I cannot stand light or any noise_ I can feel my heart pounding in my head_ and I have barely eaten because I can't keep anything down (thrown up twice with constant nausea). This is the worst headache I could ever imagine_ and for awhile the pain was so bad that I was sure I was having an aneurism_ and that just gives me anxiety. I skipped my Tuesday night dose and I will probably skip Wednesday morning. I plan on calling my doctor and hopefully trying something else_ otherwise I might have have to just not finish the prescription because I cannot deal with these side effects_ they have been much worse than my first break out.,F,22,1  days500mg 2X D,10/8/2014,Valtrex

I started getting them at the age of 32 after my historectomy.  My doctor told me that I was exposed as a child - and much like shingles - a stressful situation is what brought the virus out.  I am still on the fence about that idea ( since the nurse at the time of my historectomy had a cold sore ) he assures me that it was just a coincidence. I am not so sure about that.  At any rate_ Valtrex has been a life saver for me - in the past 2 yrs I have only had about 4 outbreaks which were almost unnoticeable and gone in just a few days.,F,47,2  years500 MG 1X D,4/8/2014Email,Valtrex

I took Valtrex for 30 days straight at 1gm per day then used it only as needed. I had a physical done and found out my kidney function has declined significantly due to Valtrex. 5 months earlier my kidneys were normal on an earlier physical.  I also experienced irritation of my eyes_ fatigue_ lower back aches(kidneys) _and numbness in my limbs. The product works_ but be very cautious when you do use it.

This medication initially seemed to be a God-send for preventing my frequent (premenstrual) breakouts but symptoms came on fast and without warning after almost two years (most of that time as suppressive therapy). I went from being in the best shape of my life (very fit_ active_ recently took up jogging) to dreading the walk to my car at the end of the workday; this happened almost overnight. It took a while to put the pieces together and it has been a scary experience.

57, 4, Genital Herpes,Nausea_ Severe stomach cramps_ dizziness_ headaches_ fever_ fatigue_ and mild hallucinations,A month ago I found out I had genital herpes (And screw the bastard that gave me this damn thing). It's a very mild case_ but still a pain in the arse (literally ha-ha) I was first told to go on the cold sore cream_ but it would take forever to go away_ and then come back as soon as I stopped using the cream. 2 days ago the doctor prescribed me Valtrex_ and told me to take 500mg twice daily. Can I just say holy crap this stuff is expensive - Love uni Student Dilemmas. Anyway_ it's given me bad nausea_ a bit of dizziness_ bad headaches_ a bit of a fever and every now and then I'll see random bright spots of light that quickly disappear_ and that screws with my head. Those side effects don't bother me so much though_ it's the ridiculously sharp stomach cramps that it gives me that are pissing me off. The best way to describe it would be super super super scary period cramps_ but 10x more painful. (And yes_ I'm sure it's not actually period cramps). Seeing as severe cramps aren't listed as an official side effect_ I was wondering if anyone else got this also?Despite these side effects_ I'll continue using it in future as it's cleared up the break out really quick. Although I'm not sure about suppressive therapy yet.,F,19,2  days500MG 2X D,9/21/2013Email,Valtrex

I gained 7 lbs in 10 days (I only weighed 110 to begin with)  I'm going to try a cleanse to try to get this nasty drug out of my system.  Also_ I don't know for sure if it helped speed up the recovery from shingles.  It took 3 weeks for my shingles to finally clear up_ which probably would have happened on its own.

Knock on wood_ I haven't had a full sore break out in 2+ years. Seldom_ a tiny tingle will come about_ then looks like a tiny white pimple. As long as I don't touch it_ they disappear within 2 days thout any pain or nastiness. I practically don't have any break outs anymore. I have never had any side effects that I know of... so unless any crazy issues pop up_ I'll continue to utilize this EXCELLENT medication. Daily.,,F,35,10  years1 Gram,8/18/2013Email,Valtrex
