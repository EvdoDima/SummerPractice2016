2, 5, Anxiety and Depression,None really,This drug has been a miracle for me.  Zoloft stopped working after taking it for 10 years and I slipped into depression and severe anxiety again the last two years without realizing it.  Took this and very quickly got relief from the depression but esp the crippling anxiety.  This med works amazingly well for both anxiety and depression plus there's no sexual side effects.  I hope it keeps on working.,M,7,9  months40mg 1X D,6/10/2016Email,Viibryd
3, 1, Major depression,Dropping thingsSleep paralysisRestless leg syndromeNotable weight gainAuditory hallucinations,"From the very start_ I had many side effects that I have never experienced with any other anti-depressant I have been on before (several).The first most notable one was dropping things. Several times a day. Specific types of items_ fruit_ glassware and cups. Anything that required a grasp around a surface. I dropped fruit every single morning while preparing meals for for my kids .I broke most of my glassware and spilled to go cups and water bottles almost daily in publicI spilled things almost daily. just slip out of my hand without any warning or more general notable weakness of grip It would ""give way"".I also began having sleep paralysis early on before I hit full dosing. I've had it a few times in my life without meds and it's always a terrible experience. But imuch worse on Viibryd. Skip this dug altogether if you are prone to panic attacks . It's absolutely awful. I was aware but not quite awake and unable to move. For tremendously long periods Upon falling asleep and during the night.It was claustrophobic and terrifying at times even though I knew what it was. There were a few nights that it was so bad_ I was scared to try to go back to sleep after 3 consecutive episodes. I was fully aware and able to talk myself through it_ even then_ the feeling of being trapped and not in control is extremely unpleasant. And losing sleep is the last thing that helps my depression.And also_ despite the packaging claims_ I gained a notable amount of weight RAPIDLY",F,47,5  months40mg,5/26/2016,Viibryd
4, 2, Depression,Tinnitis_ sleep paralysis_ tiredness,I was on Viibryd twice and the first time it did help with depression_ but made me feel almost numb to everything. The first time I was on it for several months with no side effects except sexually. I went off for that reason and to see if I really needed to be on an antidepressant anymore. I was fine for quite awhile_ but the depression did come back due to alot of family and health problems_ so I went back on Viibryd and found this time that it made no difference with my depression. I have tinnitus anyway and it made that worse_ and then came the sleep paralysis that I didn't have the first time I took it.  I didn't know what was causing that and researched it and found that other people on Viibryd were experiencing the same thing. If you've never experienced sleep paralysis count yourself lucky. It's terrifying and it would happen even if I was just dozing_ not even fully asleep_ on the sofa watching TV. I have since gone off of this drug. I don't think it caused any weight gain for me_ but the side effects that really started the second time with no relief from depression were enough for me to never want to be on any of these drugs again.,F,70, 20mg 1X D,5/22/2016,Viibryd
5, 4, Major Depression,With 20mg I experienced major irritability.  When I went to 40 mg_ I experienced Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). My Dr. cut me back to 20mg and the RLS went away.,I cut back from 40mg to 20mg recently. Will hopefully be fine on 20mg with no side effects. Fingers crossed!,F,57,2  months40 then 20 1X D,5/18/2016,Viibryd
6, 1, ,Sleep paralysis_ Night terrors,Was afraid to go to sleep for fear of dreaming about being paralyzed in my dreams by some unknown demon like force trying to abduct me or experiment on me.I knew I was dreaming but i couldn't wake myself up.I kept screaming and crawling to someone to wake me up while I watched myself lay there_ but it was only in my head they couldn't hear me.It was vivid dreams like being stuck in a horror sci-fi movie. Very scary stuff!,F,40,10  days,5/15/2016Email,Viibryd
7, 4, Major Depressive Disorder,Nausea_ itchy scalp_ diarrhea,My doctor suggested this as an alternative to all of the other medications I've tried and hated over the years (Celexa_ Prozac_ Lexapro_ Lamictal- all made me gain a ton of weight_ to the point where my depression would return). This is the first drug I've taken that I am happy with. No weight gain_ no sexual side effects. I do have to take it after I eat_ otherwise I feel nauseous. I also take it in the morning_ because when I was taking it at night it gave me crazy dreams. The first few months were frustrating_ because it bothered my stomach and one drink would make me feel incredibly hungover. But after probably three months_ most of that subsided. I hope with all of my heart that it keeps working for me for the long haul_ because I haven't felt this normal in years- and I don't want it to go away.,F,28,1  years10mg 1X D,5/8/2016Email,Viibryd
8, 1, MDD/Anxiety,It worked for my depression_ BUT...the withdrawal side effects were debilitating. Vertigo_ wanted to scratch my skin off my body_ brain zaps_ overwhelming fatigue_ tinnitus_ headache_ brain fog_ nausea. Within 2 days of not having the medication_ I was completely unable to function on my own. I had to have my sister go and pick up my prescription for me_ because I was unable to walk without holding onto walls_ let alone get in the car and drive. Within 30 minutes of taking the medication_ my symptoms had started to subside.,I finally decided to come off the medication_ and worked with my psychiatrist to gradually wean me off the medication. I went from 40mg_ to 20mg for two weeks_ to 10mg for two weeks_ then discontinued the medication.  I had the same withdrawal symptoms as before_ just not as severe_ but there was one symptom that I still experience now_ a month off the meds...which is the periodic sensation that my body is trying to jump thru my skin. My thoughts are clear_ and I feel a lot better knowing that I'm off the medication. This is a medication that I would not suggest for my worst enemy to take. The withdrawal side effects are horrible. It needs to come with black box warnings to let people know that they should NOT stop taking the medication abruptly.,F,49,2  years40mg 1X D,4/25/2016Email,Viibryd
9, 1, deppression,severe anxiety_ sleep deprivation_ intense anger and rage_ muscle aches_ electric brain clicks__ nightmares_ feeling worthless_ hopeless_ could not stop crying and hallucinations.,"PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!  I wanted to die.  I am 66 years old and have never had such horrible side effects in over 40 years of being on and off of antidepressants.  Who in heaven's name would put out such a horrendous drug that is suppose to help people?  I called my Dr. after being on Viibryd for 16 days:  10mg for 7 days_ 20mg for 7 days and 40mg for two days and told him I cannot_ would not continue taking this drug.  The nurse asked me why_ and after reciting the list of severe anxiety_ heart racing_ could not sleep_ agitation_ intense anger and rage_ body aches_ incessant headache_ feelings of a broken heart_ worthlessness_ pacing around_ couldn't sit for even 5 minutes_ and the worst of all_ was seeing my dead brother in my back yard_ the Dr. came back and said_ ""yes_ stop!""  I am still experiencing awful side effects_ can't get myself together.  A hanger fell out of the closet and hit my hand_ and I cursed like I a sailor using mf_ all the ""C"" words relating to men and womens' sexual organs.  My husband stood there_ stunned_ as I fast-paced around the room_ then I broke down crying hysterically  and apologizing to him.  Please do not take this drug!

13, 1, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Brain zaps if missed a dose.  20 lb weight gain.  Intense sugar/carb cravings.  Sexual side effects (no orgasm) Gastric issues.  Bloating.  Fatigue.,Stay far away from this drug!!  I've lost 21 lbs and my stomach is no longer bloated/inflamed since going off this drug.  I had numerous lab tests because I thought I had major gastric problems - turned out it was just the drug!  I no longer crave sugar like a heroin addict.  I feel pretty normal now_ but am on Bupropion for depression_ so that helps.  I vowed to tell everyone to stay away from this drug.  It may help anxiety_ but it's HORRIBLE in every other way.,F,37,4  years40 mg 1X D,3/28/2016Email,Viibryd
14, 4, MDD,Some weight gain_ approx 15 pounds. I'm not sure I can blame the med for that.,Viibryd has helped a LOT. I can get up in the morning! I have increased energy and am able to tolerate being around people. I still have some issues with depression but I am so much better. I have taken many antidepressants over the last 20 years and I have to say this is definitely one of the best.,F,59,2  years40 mg 1X D,3/8/2016,Viibryd

16, 1, Recurring major depresion,"Excess need for sleep but still tired/sluggish/sleepy. Slightly reduced performance at work due to tiredness_ lack of energy_ difficulty getting up to go to work due to sleepiness. Occurring rarely: vivid dreams; occasionally ""trapped in a dream"" where I can wake up but can't escape the dream - afraid to fall back asleep but can't become lucid. Missed dose 2 different times - loss of work because of extreme eye itching_ itchiness_ dizziness_ vertigo_ brain zaps_ fatigue_ diarrhea. I went off this drug for 2 weeks and had frequent brain zaps_ extreme lethargy_ itchiness_ vertigo_ dizziness. I thought my symptoms were from going back to my old drug but have now realized it was Viibryd withdrawal.",DO NOT MISS A DOSE OR TAKE A DOSE LATE! EVER! Missing a single dose and being late to take the next resulted in loss of a day and a half of work due to the severe eye itchiness_ itchiness_ vertigo_ dizziness_ tiredness_ brain zaps_ diarrhea. I am terrified of being on this drug and more terrified to go off. The lethargy when trying to go off this drug was EXTREME and the brain zaps were occurring several times daily ? frequently literally one right after another after another and the vertigo was frequent and a bit scary as I would feel like I was going to fall or pass out. Viibryd works for my depression but the side effects and consequences of missing a dose or being late to take a dose are scary and result in loss of work. I am known at work for my energy and drive. I am not quite that person when on Viibryd because of feeling so tired. I don't know what to do. I see my doctor in 3 weeks and want off this drug but am very scared of the withdrawal effects - how long they last and how strong they are. From what I have read of patient comments on various websites_ there is no escaping them.  I wish I never met this drug. ,M,46,3  weeks20 1X D,2/17/2016EmailHistory,Viibryd
17, 3, Depression,Insomnia_ brain zaps_ vivid dreams_ dizziness_ vertigo,Started this drug on 10mg_ made my stomach upset at first but only the first day or two. Worked my way up to 40mg and i had good results at first. Insomnia is manageable if you can stay on a morning schedule with it but You have to eat with it and I hardly ever had much for breakfast so I took it with dinner. I started having vivid dreams which most of the time I enjoyed. If I missed a dose or if I was late taking my pill the withdrawals would start. Most of the time it would start  with vertigo or dizziness or sometimes not at all but taking tthe pill right away would fix it. However.. I could never miss a dose.. if I fell asleep and missed a dose then I would have brain zaps. They would trap me in my nightmares. TERRIFYING nightmares. I was unable to wake myself up and when I did finally wake up I wouldn't be sure if I was still dreaming or not. I stopped taking the medicine because I worry about being dependent on it for the rest of my life and I can't deal with the withdrawals if I forget to take it or if something were to happen where I wasn't able to take it one night..not to mention the price of the pill. I tried to taper off but couldn't take the brain zaps so I ended up back on it but quit cold turkey recently because I ended up drinking that night and forgot to take the pill and passed out... Which I highly do not recommend! However I did make it through that night without feeling or noticing the brain zaps! Now just stuck with this never ending dizziness..,F,24,3  months40,2/14/2016,Viibryd
18, 4, Anxiety,When I was on 40mg it was too much for me.  I felt very wired and didn't sleep well. I cut it down to 20mg before I saw my Dr. again and I felt a little less anxious.  My Dr.  Then told me to cut it down to 10mg.  I am feeling much better with this dosage.  I feel less anxious and sleeping better.,I think you need to try this at different dosage levels and see if it works for you.,F,65,1  days10,2/10/2016,Viibryd

20, 2, Major depression,Nausea_ diarrhea_ and upset stomach for first couple of weeks. Then those went away. Sleeping issues: see below.,This medicine has done a very good job at making my depression bearable. However_ if I were to ever miss a dose_ I would know as soon as I fell asleep. I would have a horrible and vivid night terror that I couldn't wake up from. When I would finally wake up_ I had only been asleep for 10 maybe 20 minutes. This happened multiple times. Naps were no longer an option because I would wake up from them and hallucinate and not really be sure if I was still dreaming or not. I feel like I have begun to lose touch with reality. I can't tell the difference from things that I have dreamt or things that have actually happened. I absolutely love this drug for taking away my suicidal thoughts that had plagued me daily for months. But it is beginning to make me terrified. I have never had sleep issues before and have never experienced hallucinations this vivid.,F,23,4  months40MG,1/13/2016Email,Viibryd
21, 2, Major depression and anxiety,At first I felt like it was working_ now 5 months later_ I'm feeling extreme tiredness_ not able to think clearly_ major anxiety- every little thing is overwhelming.,Started taking about 6 months ago. In the last month_ I've been sleeping alot_ low on energy_ can't even fix myself a meal. I get overwhelmed with trying to do the simplest test_ such as making myself a meal. It's hard to do anything simple_ I was able to do before. I'm getting off of the Viibryd tomorrow and will try Cymbalta.,F,38,6  months40 mg,11/22/2015Email,Viibryd
22, 2, Severe depression_ eating disorder,I initially agreed to try out Viibryd because my psychiatrist promised me it had no effect on weight. WRONG! Within the first week I gained three pounds_ and I wasn't eating anything differently.,i just won't put up with any drug that causes weight gain_ so I stopped it.,F,24,7  days,11/20/2015,Viibryd
23, 3, Major Depression/Severe Anxiety,It's a nightmare with my insomnia.,I've been on Viibryd for 2 years_ it's extremely expensive with my insurance however my doctor assured me this medication was exactly what I needed for my disorder. I fully committed myself to this medication because my disease was breaking me down. I had been on Zoloft_ Welbutrin_ Lexapro...and I was tired of trying all these different drugs. And I was still having panic attacks and crying all day. It took all I had to contain myself just to go to work everyday. My point is_ I just don't think Viibryd works! I've been on it for 2 years and I'm in the same place_ mentally. Still having panic attacks and breakdowns with an empty wallet. I have an appointment next week with my Primary Doctor to research something else.,F,38,2  years40 mg 1X D,11/14/2015Email,Viibryd
24, 3, Major depression,Rapid weight gain_ brain zaps_ intense craving for sugar.,I started it after I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. At the time I was on Lexapro and Wellbutrin_ and was weaned off of these medications while I was going up on Viibryd. For the first nine months or so it seemed to do its job_ but then I noticed that I started to get mood swings that caused my therapist to believe I may have some sort of borderline personality symptoms. I started to show signs of suicidal thoughts as well and have since started tapering down on the drug_ as this was an indication that it was no longer working. I am down to 10 mg at the moment and I have noticed that I no longer crave sugar constantly_ my weight has slowly started to drop_ and the side effects of tapering are minimal. Overall_ it would have been a good short-term drug. I don't believe I should have been on it for this long. It was also VERY expensive even with my insurance!,M,21,1  years40 mg,11/14/2015,Viibryd
25, 5, Social anxiety,At first it makes you nauseous but it gets better each day and must be taken on a full stomach. You quickly get used to the medication and it goes away.,It has caused me to lose weight.,F,30,1  months20 mg 1X D,11/7/2015,Viibryd
26, 4, Anxiety/heaviness in my head,I'm so surprised by all of the serious side effects everyone is reporting.  I had some jittery legs and nausea for the first 2 days and I could tell it was changing things in my body_ but after that I had more energy_ could get out of bed in the morning_ able to concentrate and do my work.  About the 3rd month I did have some interesting nightmares_ but I'm a vivid dreamer anyway_ so I didn't find that to be too much out of the ordinary.  I've had no weight gain_ but my appetite has lessened.  Other than that I've had no unusual symptoms or complications with this drug.,I feel like it has helped but not sure how long I'll stay on it.,F,54,120  days20mg 1X D,11/2/2015,Viibryd

28, 2, Major Depressive Disorder,Extreme nausea. Sensitivity to smell and motion. Occasional diarrhea. Daily episodes of gagging/dry-heaving. Intense stomach pain. Symptoms were moderate in the beginning but worsened over the months it was taken_ ultimately becoming unbearable and preventing me from living normally.  Decrease in dosage did not stop side effects.,A functional anti-depressant taken since others had caused weight gain. Although the weight gain stopped and it was effective in it's treatment of depression_ the side-effects worsened over the period of use to the point where it did more harm than good.,M,25,5  months40 1X D,11/2/2015,Viibryd
29, 5, depression,when i began taking it diarrhea was pretty common. i had a few very vivid dreams during that time as well. after about a month or so_ both of those side effects wore off and i was feeling better than ever. i've missed a dose a few times by accident and that'd usually mean i was spending the rest of the day crying around the house and nothing more. i was on cymbalta for awhile and if i ever missed a dose my whole day would be hell and i'd feel so sick. i'd get hot flashes and would become extremely nauseous but  none of that happened with viibryd.. which was a relief. another side effect is that maybe only once a month or so i sleep for 16 hours straight. nothing anyone does can wake me. i'm not complaining of having the most relaxing sleep session ever but it can get in the way of daily responsibilities. but other than that_ viibryd has really helped me cope with my depression and i'd wake up feeling like i could face the day on a regular basis.. the diarrhea is totally worth it.,i've been switched over to effexor xr recently because my insurance doesn't want to cover viibryd. i feel like shit compared to when i was on it. cymbalta also sucks.,F,23,8  months40 mg 1X D,10/31/2015Email,Viibryd

My hands shook so much I woke my husband up. I felt like I had ants crawling on my scalp. I spent the next 4 days so nauseated I couldn't eat anything. Messed me up for a week.

36, 4, Severe Depression,Diarrhea_ leg cramps_ sweet cravings_ weight gain_ hungry all the time_ suicudal thoughts- preoccupation with weird thoughts,For the first 1.5 years it was great. I could actually think clearly_ brain function was normal_ I felt like a normal person. The side affects of the leg cramps_ and potty problems were worth it. My doctor had me taking 40mg one day and 30mg the next. If I took 40 everyday the leg cramps were unbearable. I Gained over 40 pounds it looked like I was 7 months pregnant_ the fat gain was a lot and it happened over the 1st year on the drug. I would walk 3 to 5 miles at least 5 times a week and the weight would not budge - no matter if I ate a little_ normal_ or a lot. Then the bad thoughts came so I started weaning off drug my doctor has done it slowly_ first week_ 30mg and 20 mg alternating days - next week 20 mg this week has been alternating days of 20 mg and 10 mg - next week will be 10 mg everyday - then alternating 10mg and nit taking any. This week I have had no demonic head parties and have actually seen a decrease in body fat and lost 4 pounds. Leg cramps are almost gone. The potty issues are better but I take diabetic mess that cause issues.  I did not realize until weaning that the drug was causing the food cravings. I do recommend the medicine but maybe just not for long term use. I am feeling good and still on my 150mg Wellbutrin SL,F,53,2.5  years40 mg 1X D,9/27/2015,Viibryd

I have my ups and downs sometimes but it makes it easier to manage and help put things into prospective. I feel like I can function normally.  No longer as moody and I'm able to be more outgoing.,Do NOT drink alcohol on medication you will be nauseous for two days trust me I learned the hard way dispite the fact it says not too anyways .

41, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Sever diarrhea_ especially after eating_gas_ difficulty in achieving orgasam_ and crazy fitful dreams.,I have been on just about every antidepressant made in the last 18 years. Viibryd has helped me more than anything I've ever tried! While there are side effects_ and they seem bad_ I went from wanting to die_ to living life for the first time in years! I started spitting my 40 mg tablets and taking 20 mg twice a day. The crazy dreams totally stopped! If I forget the night dose the dreams come right back. I could care less about the diarrhea and sexual side effects. Small price to pay to actually live again! Of course I haven't told my doctor anything about my side effects. I should probably do that!

42, 2, depression agitation,After starting taking meds terrible stomach cramps for weeks & finally subsided. If i didn't eat with meds I was nauseous_ if you forgot it 1 day you felt it.  I felt ok for the first few months_ of taking this Dr. said Viibryd would make me less sleepy & it did for awhile.  The brain freeze has been happening to me_ it's a very strange feeling of nothingness at times.  Irrational outbursts or crying episodes.  Sex drive has not existed since I have been on this med.After 4 months started waking up with feeling of stiffness in hands felt like some kind of inflammation and feet cramps,I would not recommend this medication to anyone & I am in the process of tapering off this med & will be off it in about another week. .  If you even have 1 drink with this med it makes you feel weird. If I need to go back on anything it will be citalopram.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone & I am in the process of tapering off this med and will be off it soon.,F,52,6  months10 1X D,8/16/2015,Viibryd
43, 4, Depression,Diarrhea_ G.I. Cramps_ decreased appetite.,I have taken many anti-depressants over the course of the last 10 years.  This is the first one that has actually helped my depression.  I have more energy to do things and I don't dread getting out of bed every morning.  I have actually started exercising which can only help things.  The best thing is no sexual side effects!  I can actually orgasm again!!!  The ssri's had all but made that impossible. It's only been 2 months but so far this medication gives me hope of feeling normal again.,M,43,2  months20 mg,7/26/2015Email,Viibryd

All have subsided,"Upon starting the viibryd I also purchaced a ""fisher wallace"" brain stimulator_ I think they compliment each other nicely_I have'nt felt this good in a long time.

46, 4, manic and post-p depression,I have terrible nightmares. If I wake up shortly after taking my medicine I feel like I am drunk and cannot move.,Aside from side effects_ I believe it has been a great mood stabilizer. My doctor also added 300mg of welbutrin to me regimen. I would prefer to be off completely but not sure I could cope.,F,29,3  years40MG 1X D,7/11/2015,Viibryd
47, 5, major depression,nausea 2 hours after taking the pill,The only side effect I get is extreme nausea only the first 4 days when first starting the medication and now again since I increased my dosage. I don't have much of an appetite which is great since I've been trying to suppress my appetite anyway. I really hope this is it for me with the side effects as I've read some horrible side effects others are having with this medication. As for my depression I do feel like this medication has helped me a lot. I don't feel like I did to where I couldn't even get out of bed to face my day. I look forward to doing fun things again and have zero anxiety when I do these things. So far so good!,F,31,8  days20 mg 1X D,7/8/2015Email,Viibryd
48, 3, Depression,Diarrhea weight gain indigestion sleeping issues vivid dreams,This worked great in the beginning as I got into it is seem to be good I was coming out of my depression but when I missed a dose I had the worst nightmare I've ever had in my entire life! It a has also caused some weight gain_ carb craving like crazy_ I mean craziness! For about three weeks now I've been noticing that I'm having difficulty waking up it's like I'm always in REM sleep no matter if I'm going to sleep for the night or if I lay down and take a nap during the day I can't wake up I can't even open my eyes it is awful and a few weeks ago I punched my husband in the head thankfully he was turned the other way!! But for the last few weeks the dreams have been torture literally bloody ghastly vivid dreams with death and violence just awful just absolutely stressful I mean like I'm trying to relieve myself from stress not be stressful while I'm sleeping come on!!   I've called the doc and I plan to wean off ?smh,F,53,3  months40mg,7/3/2015,Viibryd
49, 1, Major depression,Terrible anxiety_ especially upon waking.Angry_ weight gain_ itching_ heart palpitations_ itching feet. Mood swings. High blood pressure where it had always been low before.,I have been taking some form of anti depressant for many years. This is by far the worst one I have ever been on. Others have made me gain weight_ fatigued_etc._ but none have ever made me feel like I was going insane like this drug has. I have never had so many symptoms hit me all at once and I couldn't decipher what was going on_ because I was dealing with the loss of my father and many other things. I'm so glad I read what other people had to say and realize now it wasn't me_ it was the medicine. This is a very dangerous drug. I noticed if I forgot to take it as soon as I woke up_ terrible side effects would occur. Anxiety_ panic attacks_ uncontrollable crying. These symptoms got so bad that I tried to commit suicide_ because I couldn't deal with what all that was going on inside my head and my body. Please do not take this drug. I am now being weaned off of it and trying to recover from all the aftermath of attempted suicide. This was totally out of character for me. I have not been myself at all the entire time I was on this drug. It's hard to know what's going on when there are a lot of outside factors you are dealing with. That is why it took me so long to figure out that it was the medicine. Even my doctor didn't see it.,F,51,6  months40 MG 1X D,7/2/2015Email,Viibryd

52, 1, Major depression,terrible pains and stiffness in hands/feet.  Spent a lot of money on being evaluated for rheumatoid arthritis and other auto immune diseases.   I had symptoms of a pinched nerve in both hands but worse in right. Felt like I had flu-- could barely walk some mornings- only with taking pain meds and a lot of ibuprofen.   All of this started after I went to 40 mg dose about 3 mo ago.   I could barely move in the middle of the night and in morning.  I went from being healthy to feeling like I was crippled.  And not one Dr knew what it was.  Finally I looked online to see if viibryd could cause pain-- and there is was-- all of my symptoms.  This crap should be illegal,drs should know about this.  My dr wanted me to go for a full body CT scan next to see if I have cancer!   It's just this awful drug,F,53,7  months40 mg,6/7/2015,Viibryd

55, 4, Depression,"Just the runs in the first few weeks of taking it_ after some weeks of being on it_ seemed I needed just a ""little more"" of something_ so my Dr. put me on 30mg of Buspirone (15 mg_ 2 times a day) and I seem totally fine.  Missing a dose is weird_ feel like having allergy attack!  itchy nose_ eyes_ head_ little foggy.",Wish I IDIDN'T have to take anything_ but I went through big change in work_ 2 deaths and a close friends cancer diagnosis and handled all very well.  Not so detached_ allows me to cry (which other stuff seemed to keep me from feeling)_ so all in all a good mix for now,F,51,2  years40 MG 1X D,5/12/2015,Viibryd

58, 3, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Started on the dose pack at 10mg then 20mg then 40mg_ the 10 seemed to work somewhat then went to the 20 and started getting foggy feeling_ then to 40 and I was like a walking zombie. Pdoc switched me down to 20mg but still foggy_ so was told to cut the 20 in half to make 10mg but didn't get much relief with 10mg. Just not the right one for me.

59, 2, Manic depression,Started off great. Depression decreased a ton. Almost overnight gained 30 pounds. Depression came back_ almost even worse than before. Intrusive thoughts. Muscle weakness. Vertigo. Sleep paralysis. And I'd have these strange occurrences about an hour after falling asleep_ where I'd jolt awake feeling like something was TERRIBLY wrong. Blurry vision. Muscles aches and cramps. Extreme fatigue. The list goes on...,Contact me if you have any questions or had a similar experience. If this drug works for you_ that's fantastic_ but for ME_ I wish I never would have started on this damn drug. I am now on DAY 5 completely off of it. (Yes_ I tapered) it is terrible. My mind is racing_ I'm so dizzy that I had to call into work. It literally feels like I'm on a merry-go-round. Suicidal thoughts. Panic. Insomnia. You name it. I'm looking on the bright side though_ hopefully just a few more days and this medication can just be out of my life.,F,22,1  years40 mg,4/7/2015Email,Viibryd
