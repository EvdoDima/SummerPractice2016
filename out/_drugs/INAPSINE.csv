1, 1, ER visit_ possible gallbladder atta,Inapsine was injected into my IV along with Benadryl by an ER nurse. I have been told only a M.D. or Anasthesiologist_ not a nurse_ is permitted to inject this. It is to be given in an operating room or OR recovery room only. I was given this because of a sudden onset of nausea_ projectile vomiting_ and loss of bowel control. I immediately went crazy_ having a horrible panic attack. The nurses would not respond to me pressing the call button. I blacked out and then came to_ still having a panic attack. I felt an incredible need to run out of the hospital. I could not be still. A family member drove me home and I could hardly stand to sit for the ride home. I have never felt anything like this in my life. I paced the floors for 4 days_ unable to sleep or be still. I tried walking it off in a mall but when I entered the elevator to go down_ I panicked and ran out. I have never been able to ride downward on an elevator without having a panic attack ever since. This has been over 4 years ago now. I have permanent neurological damage and have reported this to the FDA. A neurologist wants to do an MRI to look at brain damage caused by this injection_ as well as nerve conduction studies_ and a test blowing air in my ears. I can't afford this and think the drug manufacturer should take care of these studies for me.,This medication ruined my life. I will have to avoid going in buildings with elevators the rest of my life_ including hospitals. Right now_ I am able to use stairs but if I need surgery at a hospital_ they won't discharge me to walk down stairs. One day_ I won't be able to use stairs anymore.,F,34,1  timesunknown,12/29/2014,Inapsine
2, 1, Migraine,Was given inapsine and benedryl in ER for migraine since the shot I got for a migraine the day prior provided no relief. In 5 seconds_ my life changed. I went from training for triathlon to not being able to walk but a few steps at a time. Extreme panic_ couldn't breath. Thought I was dying. 10 months later and still having issues. It caused inflammation to the lining of my ribs. Every day I wish I had just waited out the migraine versus this nightmare.,,F,43,1  days 1X D,5/3/2014Email,Inapsine
3, 1, Kidney stone,Within minutes of receiving the drug_ I went into the worst panic attack I could ever imagine_ violent shaking_ hallucinations_ and uncontrollable fear. If I there had been a gun within my reach_ I would have shot myself in the head to escape  the reaction. I was given Benadryl and Valium which somewhat lessened the effects. I went home and was in a state of confusion and couldn't sleep for about 18hours. 3 days later_ I developed chronic panic attacks. This was probably 15 years ago and I still need to take anti anxiety medication every day. Doctors have told me that this drug could not have caused my long term panic disorder_ but I didn't have it before being given Inapsine.,,F,61,1  days 1X D,2/21/2014,Inapsine
4, 1, Nausea_ vomiting,After the first IV injection_ I had a panic attack severe enough they moved the terminal cancer patient in my room to another room. They gave it to me again with the same panic attack. I protested but received a third dose.  I suffered severe panic attacks for the next two years and have had anxiety of varying degrees for the last 18 years.  Never did I have a problem with panic or anxiety before. Also_ it did nothing for the vomiting.  Why is there not a class action suit for this drug??!!,,F,43,2  days,1/14/2014,Inapsine
5, 1, Nausea_ vomiting,I didn't get any symptom relief and I wound up feeling like my skin was crawling_ I was disoriented and suicidal. I wound up in the emergency room three days after getting it in urgent care_ suicidal and terribly uncomfortabke. I had to take double doses of benadryl for three weeks before I was back to normal. Women should not take this medicine_ as studies show that women in childbearing years are likely to have a bad reaction to it. Horrible to be stop sick from out.,,F,34,1  days,6/29/2013Email,Inapsine
6, 1, Extreme Nausea,I was sick with Gastroenteritis and I had to make a trip to the ER for relentless vomiting.  I had already had some pain relievers for the stomach pain when the nurse brought in this medicine for nausea.  I began to dose off_ 10 minuets later I was jolted out of my sleep with a severe panic attack. I felt the need to pull my IV and run out of the ER. I told the nurse to unhook me so I could leave_ as soon as I made it home I felt like my legs were moving and needed to be moved and I was very tachycardic (133 bpm). 4 hours later and it was still going on and made another trip to the ER where I had an EKG and the doctor checked my cardiac enzymes.  After concluding I wasn't having an MI_ I was given 2mg Ativan and 50mg Benadryl and started to feel a little more comfortable.  It took a few days to feel like my normal self again.  This was the scariest situation I have even been in!!!,,M,27,1  days,6/22/2013Email,Inapsine
7, 1, Level #9 Migraine,Sever psychosis/anxiety. This is the second time I have received this medication and both times it has caused me horrible side effects. I believe this med should be absolutely banned and they should warn you about the side effects of this medicine! It has been over 24 hours and I am still feeling the effects. The first time I received the medicine I ripped out my IV and ran out of the ER_ second time it was given through a shot and I had to leave.,,F,29,1  days,4/22/2013Email,Inapsine
8, 1, Migraine headache,Well here is my story. I go to the hospital with a migraine type headache. They tell me they are going to give me a couple shots that will make it go away and make me feel better. I took their word for it. About 5 minutes after they gave it to me I looked at the clock and thought why am I here? I need to leave! I need to leave right now! I looked at my shoes so aggravated that I was stuck in this hospital that I took them off and threw them across the room. Then I jumped out of the bed and thought about pulling the IV out of my hand. But I pushed the nurse call button. and then grabbed the rail of the bed and started shaking it frantically. The nurse walked in and said what is wrong? I said I want to leave now I don't like what you gave me and I feel like the walls are getting smaller. I feel like I am stuck here and something is holding me back. She said you are having a bad reaction to the medicine. Then some nurses came in and held me down. The doctor comes in and says everything is,,M,23,1  days2.5 1X D,4/18/2013Email,Inapsine
9, 1, pancreatitis,Received inapsine_ benadryl and zophran thru an IV. Within minutes began to get very hot and panicked. Could not catch my breath. Thought I was dying. Extreme urge to leave the hospital. Hooked up to the bed with no call light started yelling for a nurse. She brought in 2 shots of ativan. At that point my legs were twitching so bad I couldn't sit still and scared out of my mind. Had my sister sign me out AMA. I don't remember that. I have no memory of anything after that until my husband woke me up 13 hours later. The absolute scariest thing that I've ever been through.,,F,34,1  days,3/24/2013Email,Inapsine
10, 1, Had steroid injection in spine,Same feelings as above patient. Went to er that night got Ativan and better after that.,,F,,1  days,2/10/2013,Inapsine
11, 1, Dizziness,They administered the Inapsine through my IV and within a couple minutes I started to feel like I was going crazy. My body started to tremor_ my heart was racing and I just wanted to escape from the hospital....and I did!!! I removed the IV and left without being discharged. On the bus home_ I felt uncomfortable and claustrophobic_ like I just want to run around and flail my arms or jump off the bus. Got home_ had to give my son to a family member and locked myself in a dark room. Tried and tried to goto sleep_ not happening_ my legs wouldn't stop moving and I was having crazy thoughts. I woke up the next day and my legs were still moving_ still anxious and scared...so I called 911. They brought me back to the ER and gave me Benadryl and Ativan which made me feel a little better but I still feel crazy. Definitely not myself anymore. This is day 3_ I still don't feel myself_ my legs are still moving and I can't seem to express myself much. Why do they prescribe this medicine to people if there's a chance of it running someone's life?? Am I just stuck like this forever? People at the ER didn't even take it seriously. It was a joke to them.Contact me if you're going through something similar: nwsmith1984@gmail.com,,M,28,1  days,11/29/2012Email,Inapsine
12, 1, Spinal headache,Initially_ extreme paranoia and pacing.  Almost ran out of the hospital.  Had unrelenting pacing and tachycardia for days.  I must have walked a total of 30 miles in 24 hours just pacing around the house.  My legs were exhausted and about to give out_ but could still not stop walking due to this hellish medication.  After a week of Benadryl and another hospital visit_ I returned mostly to normal.,,M,24,1  daysunk_ IM 1X D,11/23/2012Email,Inapsine

15, 1, Migraine,The ER doc gave me Inapsine for my migraine and within 5 minutes I suddenly felt Panic. I just wanted to run out of the ER despite my #8 Migraine and became extremely anxious. I asked the ER nurse if this is a side effect as this feeling was very alarming and frightening to me. She said that she was not aware of it as a side-effect. 24-hours later and I am still crawling out of my skin. I feel extremely tired physically but I can't lay down for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a time and I just have to get up and pace. Will this go away?? I'm starting to worry I will never be normal again!,,F,40,1  days2.5 IM 1X D,10/15/2012Email,Inapsine

Thought of killing myself (and this is NOT the kind of thing I would have thought before). The absolute most horrid thing I have ever experienced. Still having trauma flashbacks from the experience! Closest thing I have ever experienced to what it must be like to be trapped in an irritable_ psychotic manic state.

21, 1, nausea,"Psychosis. Extreme unbearable panic.Intensity would remain constant until hospital staff gave medication to quickly induce sleep. Would wake with normal mind_ but fear horrific experience could happen again. (Never thinking could be drug side effect_ questioned whether was fear of IVs. Eventually developed panic disorder associated with IVs.) Not until ER nurse educated me on strong link between Inapsine and anxiety_ did I understand. Also_ experienced physical ""claustrophobic-like"" sense as though bound. Strong desire to move. Threatened to rip out my IV. If no relief_could possibly have resorted to suicide.",Was given Inapsine and other anti nausea medications (including Phenergan) a few times over a period of about ten years for morning sickness and flu. Initially_ I had no such side effect. My sensitivity changed to the point that I had an immediate anxiety experience after taking a suppository. Doctors never volunteered info about side effects_ and last doctor said ER nurse who told me of side effect_ didn't know what she was talking about. Have friend who responded so dramatically to Inapsine given in hospital for morning sickness_ she literally ripped out hair from her head.,F,42, ,9/19/2007,Inapsine

It makes you feel depressed for days afterwards.  Doctors in the ER like to give it to pain patients so they don't have to ""risk"" treating them with pain killing medication.  I find the side effects of Inapsine to be much worse than any painkiller I've been given for my migraines.  I will never accept this med again.",F,24,1  days,6/2/2007,Inapsine
