1, 3, Fungal infection on big toe nail,Extreme tiredness. Regular bloating sometimes extreme. (Never experienced stomach complaints previously) Occasional irritability. Heightened general anxiety. Unusual muscular and joint aches. Find usual exercise regime sometimes impossible sometimes possible with extreme exertion. Last time I exercised I had what I believe was a tension headache_ very sudden very painful. Had to walk 4 miles back! Aside from these issues the poison seems to be resulting in unaffected nail. My opinion is get the nail cut off its not worth the hell.,,M,32,7  weeks250,8/7/2016,Lamisil
2, 4, Toenail fungus and skin fungus,Very little side effects.  Very slight upset stomach...almost unnoticeable.,I'm on month 5.5 out of 6 and no problems.  I was very worried about taking this medication but my dermatologist was not.  He was right.  Unless you have a history of liver problems in your family you should go ahead and take this drug.  It started killing the toenail fungus at around 2-3 months_ so my doctor put me on it for a total of 6 months.  The worst thing about it is...you will need a blood test almost every month...and this is mucho expensive if you don't have coverage.  The medicine itself is only about $75 per month_ and that is if you have no insurance.  Don't be afraid of it...go ahead and take it...and if you somehow are one of the minority who who has problems just stop the medication and tell your doctor_ there are other medications he can give you to kill toenail fungus_ but Lamisil is the most effective.  By the way I also had a fungal rash on my hand (what a big issue this was for years) and the Lamisil started killing it after only a month.  The toenails took longer.,M,51,6  months1 pill 1X D,7/15/2016Email,Lamisil

I don't have any side affects_ and have fought this for 8 yrs_ spent 2 yrs at a poditrist who gave me a nail polish to kill the fungus and religiously for 2 yrs did this with no change.   my toes have a long way to go_ they do not appear as thick_  they look like they are clearing up_ they dont look that disgusting any more...  i am going to go thru the 90 day treatment_ I just pray I don't get these horrible side affects some of you all talk about_ but I feel fine_ if not better!

23, 1, toenail fungus,Never been sicker in my life. Extreme fatigue_ nausea_ dizziness_ constant headache_ reflux_ total lack of appetite. Unable to concentrate. All of this_ all day_ every day. Like the worst hangover +flu at the same time.,"This stuff is poison for me: it has compromised every single aspect of my life. Since blood tests have been normal_ none of the Drs I've seen have picked up on the side effects & have called it ""hormonal"" (!). Discontinued it immediately upon realizing it's been Lamisil & not lead poisoning or a brain tumor or mononucleosis or Lyme disease (all of which I've considered as possibilities_ never having had side effects to anything remotely like this). It is POISON. Yes_ it kills the fungus but I have paid for it with my sense of taste_ my ability to function as a wife and mom_ interest in family_ friends_ and life. Had to take time off from job-unable to work w/fatigue & nausea. Went from being a triathlete to being unable to walk dog around the block in 2 months. I hope to God I will be able to get my old life back. This has been a NIGHTMARE.",F,49,85  days250 1X D,3/15/2016Email,Lamisil
24, 3, Nail fungus,Mouth sores_ depression_ anxiety_ fatigue_ joint pain.,I have tried everything else for this very embarrassing nail fungus_ so I am trying to tough it out and complete the course of therapy. I begged my MD for years to let me try it when nothing else worked. I don't want to have to take anti-depressants_ and when I told him about the anxiety_ he didn't want to give me anything for it. It says not to drink alcohol_ but there isn't any other way to sleep. Taking 15-20mg melatonin_ 4-6 unisom_ and 5-8 calms forte a night to be able to sleep 4 hrs. Back pain so bad_ I stay on a heating pad on my days off all day. Halfway through lamisil therapy. Just have to try to tough it out!,F,48,10  weeks250 mg,3/12/2016Email,Lamisil
25, 2, Skin infection,Anxiety_ OCD-like symptoms_ tight feeling in chest_ loss of appetite_ feelings of worthlessness,A couple of days after taking Terbinafine I began feeling extremely low and down_ unlike myself_ and had feelings of worthlessness and depression. Then the intrusive_ OCD-like thoughts_ began; very distressing and made it difficult to focus on anything. Also experienced a tight restricting feeling in the chest. Even after I have stopped taking the medication the intrusive thoughts and anxiety persist - do not take this if you are vulnerable to anxiety or depression!,F,17,10  days250mg 1X D,2/13/2016,Lamisil

28, 1, Toenail Fungus,Dizziness_ loss of appetite_ dry mouth_ insomnia_ fatigue_ diarrhea_ tremors_ anxiety_ depression,First couple of days were okay. I experienced a little dizziness and a slight loss of appetite. If I forced myself to eat when I took the pill the dizziness went away. Third day I began to experience some slight anxiety. The anxiety increased on the fourth day. I began questioning my relationship with my boyfriend (whom I love dearly). Thought it might be hormonal. The fifth day I woke up with diarrhea and severe dry mouth (I've probably drank a couple gallons of water today and am peeing like crazy because of it. Probably good to get it out of my system quicker). Throughout the day I experienced a lot more anxiety. Tonight I became very depressed and even contemplated suicide to get away from the sudden and confusing anxiety and depression. Had to call my mother to come sit with me in my apartment so I wouldn't hurt myself. I've struggled with anxiety here and there (nothing severe)_ but this is unlike anything I've ever felt. I made the connection to Lamisil when I stumbled on this site. I'm not going to continue taking the medication! Currently I'm experiencing terrible insomnia. It's now 1:30 AM and I haven't eaten for 12 hours because I can't keep anything down/I have no appetite. It's too early to tell if the medicine is doing anything for my toes. Even if it did_ I'd rather have nasty toenails than crippling depression or any of the other horrific side effects! I do not recommend this drug!!,F,21,5  days1x/d,1/18/2016,Lamisil

On top of that I also started getting panick attacks/ anxiety/ rapid heartbeat. All and all I was just miserable. I stopped taking the meds and we are now about 2 months further and I'm still trying to heal my digestive tract. The diarrhea is gone_ I do still have soft stools and I can't eat wheat/gluten etc any longer. My stomach wakes me up in the middle of the night because of loud rumbling.....

Since the medication didn't work the first time the next year they put me on it again for 90 days the first two weeks the panic attack started again and I started to investigate on the internet and found that is one of the main symptoms is anxiety and panic attacks I would not recommend it for anyone that suffers from depression or ending mental illness or even normal people I live a normal life and then in fear for the last two weeks of my life and didn't know why.

I went to see my GP_ she thought I might have rose river virus_ malaria or dengue fever. The tests came back negative_ but I had elevated white blood cells for no reason. My GP prescribed antibiotics and some pain killers. She had no idea about the lamisil side effects niether did I! Then after sixths week_ one night_ I woke up in a very bad mood and suddenly felt really anxious_ my heart rate went to may be 180. I went back to my GP_ she thought it's due stress_ then she asked me whether I still take those pills_ I said yes. Then she searched online and she said actually those pills (lamisil) have some side effects and one of those is anexiety!!!! Then myself_ I came here to see what are the side effects_ now I realized what happened. All these problems suddenly came up due to this horrible lamisil. I still have three weeks to go and won't give up until I finish them_ as my toe nails are growing back nicely.

No other side effects at all.,I read about possible side effects before taking it_ so I decided to start the medication by taking half a tablet for 4 days_ taken at bedtime. The side effects can be somewhat bothersome at times_ but I can already see improvement so it's worth it to me. I would NOT suggest pulling it off the market as others have suggested. Reactions are different in different people. I can only say I am mostly happy with Lamisil as I have not finished the full course of treatment.,F,69,2  months250 mg,12/16/2015,Lamisil

38, 5, Fungal skin rash and toenails,Loss of appetite_ slight nausea_ headaches_ exacerbation of depression and anxiety symptoms.,"I just have to say that I've read a lot of the reviews_ and all of the other reviewers are unfairly giving this medication a bad review because they didn't like the side effects. No medication in the world is going to be free of side effects_ and if you were a well informed patient and not only discussed the medicine with your doctor but read the info that you were given by the pharmacy then none of these would come as a surprise to you. Stop blaming a ""bad"" doctor or ""bad"" medication for your willful ignorance and refusal to educate yourself about what you put into your body. Also_ none of you seem to know how to follow basic instructions_ as none that I've seen have correctly put in their dosage info. Makes me wonder how any of you were bright enough to even submit a review_ as your reading comprehension skills and basic common sense seem to bee missing with most of you.",F,32,3  weeks250 mg,10/15/2015,Lamisil

My sleep is interrupted by waking all night and I ache all over.,I would never take this drug again!  My toenail hasn't changed.

49, 1, Ringworm & toenail fungus,Chest tightness_ muscle aches_ joint pain_ headache_ nausea_ anxiety_ lightheadedness_ sore throat.,I took this drug for six of the 30 days it was prescribed and on the morning of the sixth day I felt a tightness in my chest.  It emanated from the center of the chest and spread half way to each shoulder.  I stopped taking the medication on day six.  Following the chest tightness I experienced a tender area on the front of my forehead that resulted in headaches.  The upper part of my left arm had sporadic aches and I experienced joint pain in the left elbow.  Lightheadedness and dizziness followed on the second day after stopping the med.  I called the dermatologist's office and the nurse recommended to stop taking the drug (duh) and when I asked about the chest tightness she said it should go away that day.  It didn't.  I visited my regular doctor and reported the chest pain_ numbness in the arm_ and headaches.  He ran lab work for kidneys and liver and administered an EKG.  The tests were normal.  It has been four days since I stopped the medication and the symptoms persist.  I read an article online that suggested the medication remains in the system for 200-400 hours after the last dose.  I am hoping for some relief over the next two weeks.  I will NEVER take this medication again and if anyone asks me about it I will deliver a resounding NO.  RUN.  Find another course of treatment.

52, 1, Foot rash,Anxiety and severe depression. Dry mouth and bad taste in mouth.,I have struggled with anxiety for the past year and about 4 days after starting oral terbinafine my anxiety started increasing. On the 11 th day I started feeling this dark_ hopeless feeling. I have had small bouts of depression in the past but never anything like this. I also had this preoccupation with suicidal thoughts. It wasn't until I took the last of my 14 pills that I decided to look at the side effects. Sure enough_ changes in mood_ and anxiety and depression are right there. Then I found this site and am seeing that other people have experienced a very similar situation. I took my last dose about 36 hours ago and am still having extreme symptoms.

59, 1, 1 toe nail fungus,Horrible side effects.. first week_ severe diarrhea_ stomach pains and more. And then they gone away_ I felt much better and then the pharmacy forgot to give me 2 pills and gave me them when I picked up another prescription. I ended up getting it mixed with my meds and took a double does of it. It about killed me. And 3 days later I have had to go to urgent care and get test done because I believe my gullbladder has had a flare up or something with my liver. The pain is horrible and now I see everyone else has had horrible issues as well.. pull this drug,,F,31,2  months250,5/17/2015Email,Lamisil
