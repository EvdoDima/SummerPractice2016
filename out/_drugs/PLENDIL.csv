1, 4, High blood pressure,Only side effects with generic of Plendil which is Felodipine because hard to get Plendil.,Recently heard that calcium channel blockers such as this one causes high risk of breast cancer in older women my age. Is this true? Recently had to undergo a breast stereotactic biopsy because I have very dense cystic breasts with lots of calcification. Thank God showed no cancer. But I'm very concerned whether I should stay on this medicine because of the findings of this medicine linked to breast cancer.,F,62,4  days2.5 mg,9/19/2015,Plendil
2, 1, High blood pressure,Horrible head and neck pain + weakness upon standing. I also felt like my heart was racing and had to spend an entire weekend in bed.,I will not be taking this ever again. I must get my doctor to change this med. I was taking Mycardis and Losartin Potassium previously. Mycardis worked best without all these lousy side effects.,F,52,3  days10 mg 1X D,12/29/2013Email,Plendil

4, 4, Hypertension,I have been on Plendil for over 12 years with no side effects other then linkage to my breasts. I am postmenopausal  and at risk of breast cancer. Just undergone a stereotactic breast biopsy procedure 4 months ago because of increased calcification cluster growths. As of yet no cancer thank God. I'm now worried though about stopping this med as latest findings linked all calcium channel blockers  to breast cancer. HELP!,"According to health news on MONDAY_ Aug. 5_ 2013...""Postmenopausal women who use a type of blood pressure-lowering medication called a calcium channel blocker may have increased odds of developing breast cancer_ new research suggests.Long-time users of these drugs have more than double the risk for getting breast cancer compared to women not using the medications_ according to the study_ published Aug. 5 in JAMA Internal Medicine.""We looked at these drugs because people who use them to manage their blood pressure are usually on them for the rest of their lives_"" said the study's lead author_ Dr. Christopher Li_ of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. ""There has been some evidence suggesting that some of these antihypertensives may be related to breast cancer risk.""The study of nearly 3_000 women found that among high blood pressure drugs_ only calcium channel blockers carry the heightened breast cancer risk_ Li said.",F,60,12  years10 3X D,9/12/2013Email,Plendil
5, 2, high blood pressure,I have been on Monocor...and Coversyl but my bp in the office is 180... altho at home my monitor indicates 120  most of the time going up at night and early morning 140... Doc gave me 5mg of plendil which lowers my bp but gives me migraines and weird fluttering in the chest... it makes me uncomfortable and I am unable to sleep... so after 5 days I stopped taking it and now I feel back to my old self..I think that for me it didn't help but for some people it may work wonders ...so give it a try if you are asked to try it ...you never know...I took other meds like Norvasc...Lopressor...adalat xl.... with other side effects that made it impossible for me to take them either...   ...,Science has yet to find the cure or magic pill for this health problem,F,60,5  days5 mg 1X D,5/12/2012Email,Plendil

7, 1, hypertension,Worst headache of my life with severe vomiting!,I had normal bp until June this year.  They think it might be renal hypertension but after a second opinion_ the cardio wasn't convinced it was definitely that. I tried norvasc & aldactone both of which raised my bp to 230/135 and sent me to the ER. Plendil was the absolute worst. I felt like I was having a stroke_ & nearly passed out. The pain was so excruciating I wished I was dead.  I started vomiting from the headache about 2 hrs after it developed (which was about 3 hrs after I took the pill). I have never felt so sick in my life. The next day my neurologist sent me for a cat scan as I was sure a vessel burst in my brain. Not one medication lowers my bp which was normal or low up to Jan.  They are doing 2 MRI's next week.  I went to Cornell & they believe it could be trauma hypertension. My bp after talking to them has come down to 120's & 130's w/o meds. Prior to the consult_ it was 150's-180's/100-122.  DON'T EVER TAKE THIS DRUG!,F,56,1  days,10/25/2009,Plendil
8, 5, Raynauds,Slight heart burn at beginning of medication.  Once my body got used to the medication heartburn ceased to be a problem,This is an excellent medication for raynauds.  I have noticed over time that I have had to increase the medication.  I don't know if this is because my body has got used to the medication or if my blood vessels have narrowed even more as I have got older.  I now take 7.5mg a day,F,46,10  years,4/24/2009,Plendil
9, 5, high b?p,none that I have ever noticed,I have been taking Plendil 10 mg for over 30 years once a day! I have NEVER had a problem and it has worked well in keeping my b?p under control.MY PROBLEM now is that my pharmacist cannot get Plendil..many pharmacies can't..so he gave me the deneris which I did try once before and I HATED it. I did nOT feel well at all on felodipine!Well_ I went back to the Plendil after one day off it and have been taking the plendil until yesterday when I was told I would have a hard time finding it. So the pharacist gave me the felodipine (plendil generic) to TRY agin..one day and I feel horrible. I have to see my doctor Monday to see what we can do.I donot understand why distributors stop carrying a drug when they are obviously helping some people.So felodipine is my problem..so much for some generics.i would love to hear of anyone else that has tried to switch from plendil to felodipine and had the horrible experience I have. The plendil is expensive so I can see why some people may,F,61,30  years,3/14/2009,Plendil
10, 1, High Blood Pressure + Raynauds,Flushing_ irritability_ increase in blood pressure_ swelling of gums_ dental pain_ general odema_ gastric bloating_ rash_ terrible sweating_ heat intolerance_ trembling.  This drug was so awful I was glad to stop it and have the raynauds back.,I was originally prescribed Plendil to help control high blood pressure and improve symptoms of Raynauds Syndrome.  Plendil certainly did help the Raynauds - the only problem was it helped too much - I ended up looking like I had been boiled with a horrible red rash and flushed face to go with it.  It did nothing to lower my BP_ in fact it increased while I was taking it.  I also experienced swelling of the gums and real bad dental pain around my wisdom teeth.  My whole body felt on edge and had horrible itchy sensation on my skin.  I only managed to tolerate treatment for a week - when I stopped I had to treat the side effects with anti-histamines.  It took a while for my system to settle back down again.,M,27,1  weeks,8/22/2008,Plendil
11, 1, hypertension cause:12yrs on Prempro,Tightening of the throat - and swelling in the throat thought I had Hasimoto's Thyroiditis; extreme fatigue leaving me only 4 hour days; nervousness_ anxious; after coming off felodipine_ I was put on lisinopril but continued to have extreme pain in the throat (thyroid?) for four more months that faded gradually; simultanous onset of vulvodynia with puritis ani when taking felodipine and experiencing the other well known felodipine side affects.  Shock from taking this drug most likely triggered my memopause. This is a dangerous drug!,The doctors seem to be clueless/careless about the side effects of the drugs they so freely hand out and refuse to follow up on.  I finally came off felodipine after four months when I first realized the doctor missed the common symptoms listed on the drug sheet after I went back one month later complaining to the Doc. The Dr. perscribed an antibiotic!  At the time_ I did not associate felodipine simultaneous on set of puritus ani and vulvodynia with menopause as a side effect.  It has taken me five debilitating years without a diagnosis and 24+ doctor visits plus spending the last 4 months researching on my own to obtain a self diagnosis and cure for the puritus-ani and vulvodynia (because the doctors would not take the time and I no longer could stand the misery) most likely caused by the felodipine drug nightmare. Recently_ a rare and knowlegable nurse-practioner specializing in ob-gyn confirmed my diagnosis for the record.  Memopause has been around for a longggg time and it is a C,F,62,3  months,5/1/2008,Plendil

23, 4, Uncontrollable Hypertension,Have been taking Plendil for my uncontrollable hypertension for several years. I haven't had any side effects even though I'm still having blood pressure episodes. I have to monitor my bp daily with my home digital monitor.
