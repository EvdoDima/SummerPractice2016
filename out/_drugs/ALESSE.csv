4, 1, Birth control,Emotional_ sad/depressed_ irritable_ cramping (while not on period),The first 3 months of this pill wasn't too bad. I bled a little through the first 2 weeks of taking it. After the 4th month my partner had to talk to me about how emotional and irritable I was. I didn't notice how bad I was getting until he told me. I became a very angry_ depressed and all around horrible person which is very unlike me. Completely stopping this pill. Not worth the stress in my relationship.,F,20,6  months,12/22/2015,Alesse

Headaches_ vision problems (I am prone to migraines so those two usually go hand in hand for me)_ frequent fatigue_ out of breath doing regular every day things.,I know you're supposed to give new pills 3 months but honestly_ it's not even worth it to me.

I am sick over half of every day and it's conpletelt unbareable I thought it would get better but it's getting worst. I now have a nonstop headache and all I want to do is sleep all day.

11, 4, Birth control,NONE that were negative,I love this pill and have had no issues; surprised to hear about all of the bad experiences. My periods would come twice a month and were very heavy; Alesse  has removed all cramping and they are very light. They used to last 7 days; they now last 3 and are barely there. Over the years they are there less and less. I had spotting a few times due to missing pills. No weight gain/mood issues. I plan on taking it until I hope to get pregnant.,F,27,7  years30mg 1X D,2/18/2015Email,Alesse
12, 5, Birth Control,Gained weight quite easily when I first went on it. I've never been able to fully get rid of the excess abdominal fat and this is frustrating. Never experienced ANY PMS before going on Alesse and still do not have PMS while on Alesse. I recommend this birth control to other females because of the good experiences I've had and the horror stories associated with other types of birth control pills.,,F,21,6  years 1X D,2/3/2015,Alesse

14, 1, birth control,Acne in cheeks,I absolutely hate Alessa. I've never used birth control pills before but my doctor recommended it. The first month i got a tiny rash on my cheek and it just kept getting worse. I've been off birth control pills for about 6 months now and the acne hasn't gone yet. In fact now i have tiny scars on my cheek. Ahhh! I keep googling home remedies for acne but nothing has worked so far. I have sensitive skin and so it's hard to try everything.,F,25,3  months,1/4/2015Email,Alesse
15, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,The two years I've been on this pill I've slowly connected the dots. Mood swings_ crying_ depressed_ thinning hair_ bald spots_ acne_ and only feeling good one week out of the whole month. I put on 20lbs over the two years because alesse made me hungry.

16, 1, irregular & heavy periods,Before I started Alesse my periods were crazy and I would either have a period every 2 weeks or I wouldn't have it for five months. I've been on it for a year and a half and now my periods are crazy. I'm on my 2nd this month and it's lasted 10 days so far. Tomorrow I go to the doctor. I'm worried there is something actually wrong with me. My body should be used to this by now. It's weird that it just stopped working though.,,F,16,2  years1 X D,9/22/2014,Alesse
17, 1, contraception/acne,depression_ acne_ anxiety_ inability to sleep,I was switched to Alesse from Yasmin because I had switched GPs_ and she felt that the Yasmin was too high in estrogen. Within a few days_ I started to break out with acne (I haven't had acne in 5 or 6 years)_ and my moods were all over the place. I have had issues with anxiety and depression_ and Alesse brought them back in full force. I would be set off due to little things that never bugged me before_ and I was crying constantly. I also wasn't able to sleep at night. I'm feeling much better now that I'm off of it_ but I will never take this pill again.,F,25,45  days 1X D,8/29/2014,Alesse

Had problems by the end of the first month_ but continued to take it because my doctor assured me that I was just adjusting to it and would feel back to normal after three months on it. Quite the opposite_ my mood swings became increasingly worse to the point where I felt like I had no control over myself and worried I'd gone completely crazy. I felt back to normal within three days once I discontinued use. I'm healthy and was taking no medication other than Alesse.,,F,19,4  months,4/24/2014,Alesse

25, 2, Birth control,I do not know if they are directly related but I have noticed depression hitting my life hard since about the time I started Alesse. Crying all the time_ extemely irritable and sensitive and very very depressed. Other side effects which I believe are related are long lasting periods (sometimes 10 days early but it's only in small amounts until the real thing comes usually when it's supposed to). Very annoying however as I have to wear pads for 10 days prior to getting the heavy period flow. Extemely irregular period patterns.,,F,20,3  years,1/20/2014,Alesse

29, 1, Prevent pregnancy.,Headaches_ fatigue_ cramping_ prolonged bleeding_ skin rash_ tingling in hands_ dizziness. Before Alesse_ I was on the Evra patch. I am waiting to have an IUD inserted and my doctor recommended I switch to Alesse while I wait. The first few pills I felt fine. I noticed on the 8th day_ I had developed a rash all along my arms and legs. I started to get headaches in the front of my head which are incredibly painful and lead me to become dizzy. About two weeks_ I started to bleed. I wasn't expecting my period. I have now been bleeding for thirteen days. It's very heavy and there are a lot of blood clots. I have no energy and all I want to do is sleep. Alesse and I are not a good match :( I've never reacted to a pill before.,,F,21,1  days,8/24/2013,Alesse
30, 1, birth control_ lighten periods,Shortly after starting Alesse_ I increasingly had high anxiety. Not long after_ I had so much anxiety and irritability I couldn't sleep at night. I would have to take a sleeping pill just to get some rest. I had extreme mood swings_ and itchiness down below. This sounds like a lot of women have had the same side effects as me and I can't believe this is still being prescribed.

I was a mess.....when you go from being a normal person to wanting to stick your head in the oven - something is terribly wrong.  Despite my ob/gyn (an elderly male!) telling me it couldn't be this pill_ I insisted he switch me back.

I have been on two other BC pills before this one_ but had to stop because they gave me migraines (which i have never had when not on BC). When I was on Yaz I stopped because I got a migraines and the left side of my body went numb. After getting another migraine on Alesse_ I've decided BC pills are something my body can't tolerate. I did_ however_ enjoy that in the second month of Alesse my libido was much higher than usual_ and my boyfriend did not mind!,F,20,2  months 1X D,8/24/2012,Alesse
40, 1, Birth control,At first this pill was awesome- like 1 yr x awesome. No side effects at all until my face got brown patches (melasma)  everywhere that get worse with sun exposure. Not even SPF helps. I've been able to reduce the color by staying out of the sun as much as I can_ photo facials ($$$)_ and daily SPF and lightening creams but it still remains!! I'm quite conscientious about it. Can no longer do my hair certain ways or go out without make up. Buyer beware!! Or if anyone knows of a cure - pls help me!,,F,30,2  years,8/7/2012Email,Alesse
41, 1, Birth Control/ Regulate Periods,Acne_ Nausea_ Racing Heart_ Tingling/Numbness in arm and leg_ Headaches_ Dizziness (Hospitalized),I had been on Yazmin for 6 years_ but due to the warning my Dr said to try something else. She recommended ALESSE and said it would work well. WELL.. IT DIDN'T. After about the first week I noticed a lot more acne than usual. I figured I'd stick it out and see if it would get any better. During this time I noticed my mood starting to change and one moment I was happy/feeling like myself and the next I was down and anxious about everything. Things went downhill after the 17th day of taking the pill when I woke up with a resting heart rate of 125 and tingling in my left hand. After calling 911_ an ambulance took me to the hospital and I was told later on to get off the pill IMMEDIATELY for I was having a severe reaction to the hormones (Most likely the hormone Levonorgestrel found in Alesse). After being discharged that day and told it would get better I had similar episodes of tingling/numbness in my leg and arm and the racing heart continued. I was back in the hospital within 24 hours. ALSO TO NOTE I HAD NO UNDERLYING HEALTH ISSUES AND WAS ON NO OTHER MEDICATIONS WHILE TAKING ALESSE.It has now been two days since I've been off the pill and I am out of the hospital. I have not had tingling or a racing heart in over 24 hours. I am slowly getting my appetite back. Also_ my acne is starting to clear up. I will not be trying any other birth control pill for the next 3 months.I would NOT recommend this pill to anyone after my experience.,F,20,3  weeks 1X D,6/13/2012Email,Alesse

I went back on for 4 months ( no I did not use expired pills_ i got new ones). First month into it and I developed severely itchy skin on my labia. No rashes tho. I couldn't even sleep at night... For 4 damned months!  Yeast infection test came back negative. Then I realized perhaps there is a connection. I went off the pills and the symptoms were better within a week. It took bout a month or two to get back to normal. I've been Off of it for a year now but I find my skin gets sensitive now. I can't even wax my eyebrow without it itching for a few days after. And I've been waxing everything since I was 17,,F,25,4  months,5/3/2012,Alesse

44, 2, Contraception,The first and only side effect I had for the first 3 months was nausea. At the time_ it was almost every day. I still have nausea for about a week every time I start a new pack_ but it goes away and isn't as severe. On month 4 I started to get really sore breasts about a week or so into a pack_ that would last about a week. Month 5_ and currently month 6_ I had the initial nausea at the start of a pack_ followed by sore breasts_ followed by extreme irritability and high emotions. I am having trouble dealing with my daughter (almost 3) because I'm so emotional. I find I'm getting angry at her and expecting things from her she can't do yet. I find that on top of this I'm obsessing on those things which makes me more angry and feeling like I'm spiraling out of control. This month_ I'm noticing that my face is really breaking out. I haven't had acne like this since I was pregnant with my daughter_ and before that_ highschool.,At first I thought this pill was great_ now I don't think I can stay on it. I don't want to end up harming my daughter or causing emotional scarring due to my inability to keep my emotions under control. The week before my period before Alesse I used to be able to step back_ take a deep breath_ and let an issue go. Now I seem to be unable to prevent myself from working myself up to the point where I break down in tears. I'm sure there are many people this pill works wonders for_ but I don't seem to be one of them.,F,27,6  months 1X D,3/27/2012,Alesse

46, 2, Birth control,Moodiness_ depression_ anxiety_ lighter periods_ no sex drive,I had been getting more and more depressed and anxious while on this pill_ but I thought the cause was environmental. My boyfriend finally suggested I try going off Alesse_ and I started feeling much more level-headed. I had been feeling suicidal_ crying all the time_ unable to cope with stress--although I still get anxious_ HBC was definitely contributing to how I was feeling. I switched to Alesse because my doctor thought the lower dose would be better than my previous brand (I forget the name). I guess it didn't work.,F,25,4  years 1X D,12/13/2011,Alesse

After the first round of pills I had in between bleeding which I bleed till my next period it was mostly spotting and light bleeding but still a whole month ! I got 2 mild yeast infections_ When hubby was in the mood I was dry and never really in the mood_ I felt tired all the time like I had no energy to do anything. I also woke up several nights with cramps in my calf. It felt like I had a charlie horse.

I would lose way more than usual when brushing and big clumps of it in the shower_ it took me a few weeks to realize that it was probably the pill_ it stopped getting worse when I went off it_ but even now_ I still lose a lot of hair.  I've tried lots of things to make it grow back and nothing will.  Don't take this if you don't have lots of hair to lose!  I also gained about 15-20 lbs but barely noticed that because of how bad a problem the hair loss was!,F,25,2  months 1X D,4/18/2011,Alesse
51, 5, birth control,Maybe breast tenderness,Took Tri-Sprintec and another BC and had a lot of anxiety/depression etc. I looked up online what changes in BC might help_ and decided to ask for Alesse. From what I can tell_ I have not had any more mood issues. I do have low libido_ but this could be due to other things. Period isn't super heavy_ it's on time_ no pregnancy_ no noticeable/shocking weight gain_ and especially no mood changes = a winner for me!,F,23,3  years 1X D,3/1/2011,Alesse
52, 2, lutera actually_ birth control,extreme hair loss_ mood swings,within the first two to three weeks I noticed I was losing more hair than I usually did each day. I thought perhaps it was due to something else_ but it was not. I know they tell you to wait through a few cycles and I continued taking the generic Lutera for two months (generic because my pharmacy didn't carry Aless). I stopped taking it because I couldn't take the hair loss. I've always had really thick hair but now I have thin hair. I lost a weeks worth of hair in one day. It was coming out when I brushed and washed_ as well as throughout the day. My hair is still thin however the amount I'm losing has decreased dramatically_ it appears i'm back to normal and I have been off Lutera for one month. Also I noticed that I was having more trouble than usual controlling my mood swings_ and I was a lot more irritable. I am already a moody person and I was worse for those two months. But my periods were really light and short. So since I've been off_ I'm only shedding my usual amount of hair daily_ and I my moods are more stable_ well at least back to normal.,F,27,2  months 1X D,12/8/2010,Alesse
53, 5, control menses,I started out taking brand name Alesse and then changed to generic Lutera for the past ~2 years - no side effects for the entire the time I've been on it_ until just recently - I'm starting to get a little spotting now between periods and also PMS symptoms at unusual times_ so I'm hunting for a new pill - I don't think there is a problem with the pill_ but rather my body has changed - I've gone through this a few times with oral contraceptives over the years,I actually take Alesse/Lutera a little like an extended cycle pill_ but I do mine for 6 weeks on_ 1 week off - it's been great to have fewer cycles and I didn't have any problems with it until just recently (but like I said above_ I think this is just because my body is changing) - my gyn offered to write the script this way for me when I was considering Seasonale several years ago - so I've taken Alesse as directed and 6 weeks on_ 1 week off without incident_ as well as generic Lutera 6 weeks on_ 1 week off without side effects_ but this golden age is coming to a close for me_ and after many years of menstrual bliss (light flow_ no cramps_ perfect clockwork regularity)_ the hunt begins again to find another that will do this for me,F,34,10  years 1X D,9/7/2010,Alesse

As the months went on however I pretty much started to slowly lose my mind. When it came time for my period to start I would have so many mood swings that I was pretty much a different person. I could probably write a book on the problems I had with it. I don't recommend this pill_ but that's just me_ it effects everyone differently.,F,20,1  years 1X D,8/11/2010,Alesse

This pill worked like a charm. The first month of taking it was punctuated by some light bleeding and nausea if I took the pill a few hours later than usual_ but those went away after that first month. I'm very satisfied of this product_ apart from being forced to wear glasses because of the extremely dry eyes (resembling that of the elderly according to my optometrist).,F,23,4  years,1/24/2010,Alesse
59, 4, Birth Control/Regulate Periods,Mood swings,Best pill I've used. 3-4 days of semi-light_ little cramping periods. Every period was right on schedule_ unless I missed a pill. Had slight mood swings/feelings of hostility_ but it was manageable. Was on it for 10+ years_ never had problems.,F,27,10  years,1/15/2010,Alesse
