0, 1, COPD,This was prescribed as a steroid inhaler intended to improve my breathing. I was OK the first 4 days and it did improve my breathing to some degree. On the 5th day on Aerospan I got a mild stomach ache and bad diarrhea. The 6th day just the mild stomach ache but gas and rumbling in my stomach. On the 7th day I thought I had gotten food poisoning. I had the stomach ache_ was very dizzy_ light headed_ extremely exhausted_ had tachycardia_ and in the afternoon I got very nauseous and vomited. I then felt like I was running a fever and then got the chills. I was belching_ had lots of gas_ dry mouth_ sore throat_ muscle aches and difficulty walking the leg cramps were so strong. I pulled the sheet that came with Aerospan and read the possible side effects and these were all listed. I went off Aerospan for 3 days and everything cleared up. Since I wasn't sure if it was the medication or food poisoning I took one puff after being off Aerospan for 3 days and everything flared up so it was Aero,,M,74,7  days80 mcg 2X D,5/12/2015,Aerospan hfa
