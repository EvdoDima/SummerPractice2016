0, 4, pulmonary hypertension,I am able to breath more easily and it's helped my SOB so much.  I used to get SOB while talking_ now I don't even have to think about it.  I get my blood tested for liver every month and CBC every third month.  This is a miracle drug and I am very thankful for it..............,,F,63,3  years,5/26/2008Email,Tracleer
