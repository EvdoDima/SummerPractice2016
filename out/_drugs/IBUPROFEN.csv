1, 4, Low back pain and sciatica,Took every other day as I knew it would cause stomach problems. After taking it maybe twice a week_ I started having asthma attacks which I never had before. It's unfortunate because this med helped my inflammation and decreased my pain.,Must take with Prilosec to protect stomach,F,58,1  years600 1X D,12/19/2012Email,Ibuprofen
2, 5, Sciatica/Sciatic Flare-up,Drowsiness_ Nausea_ Heartburn,A miracle worker.  I was prescribed 800mg tablets for an absolutely horrific Sciatic nerve flare-up & if it weren't for them_ I don't think I could have made it through those 5 weeks.  I typically use the OTC version for minor problems (headache_ Aunt Flo_ etc) with no side effects.  However taking 800mg x 3 times a day actually did cause a few uncomfortable side effects_ especially the drowsiness and heartburn.  Taking the tablet with a full glass of milk helped a LOT.,F,28,7  weeks800mg 3X D,7/12/2012Email,Ibuprofen

9, 4, arthritis,none,I Would like it better if it was more effective against pain_ but it generally works as described. Lasts about 3 to 4 hours.,M,50,6  months,4/11/2008,Ibuprofen
10, 4, menstrual cramps_ mild pain,the main side effect for me is drowsiness.,ibuprofen for me is a miracle drug for menstrual cramps_ does zero for migraines for me personally_ however. wonderful for little aches and pains that i am getting now that i am 40. i would not recommend taking it too often as i find it loses effectiveness. always take with food. if you take this drug too often or habitually ( not that it is addictive_ it isn't) you will have major stomach problems and possibly ulcers. use caution. if you are a chronic pain sufferer and take this daily for pain you need to find another doctor. nsaids are great but can have alot of risks if you take them daily.,F,40,20  years,11/26/2007Email,Ibuprofen

13, 2, Various muscle/joint pain,When I first took them I got a little tired_ that stopped after a couple of days.  May not have been related.,Lost effectiveness after a week or so.  took 2 800 mg 2 to 3 times a day when needed for pain. (Not as written)  Great hangover headache med_ take 1600 mg before sleeping and no headache in the am.  works good for female cramps I am told.,M,41,7  years,4/25/2007,Ibuprofen
14, 3, Buttocks joint/nerve injury,Unsure yet:  Acid-reflux/laryngopharyngeal reflux_ chronic gastritis (definitely) and/or bile gastritis.  (You don't ever want these problems.),800 mg @ 3x/day at 1st_ myself reduced it to 2x after few months_ then to 1x later.  Also_ always had a pill in morning w/o food (NOT good idea - don't do that).  For this problem_ I'm not sure it helped much_ but I was scared NOT to take it; my buttocks had been in so much horrid pain that I could only baby-step walk_ and only very gradually got better.  NOTE:  I have much confidence in Ibuprofen as a pain-killer; I've used it temporarily for many things and it's good (including an earlier accident hurting my neck) and would get a 5_ but my problem here was so bad I don't think much could help me but time - and physical therapy (started way too late).  The side-effects of long-term use are not pretty.  GI problems are horrible.  I've gone from 1 horrid problem to another.,F,36,7  months,5/12/2006,Ibuprofen
