0, 3, 2b breast cancer -preventative of m,12 hours after infusion woke up in the middle of the night moaning of pain all over my body. Chest felt tight and I was warm. This pain lasted 12 hours but a mild ache has lasted 4 days so far. Tiredness lasted for 3 days too.,Going through it_ I wasn't sure I would repeat it in 6 mos. It was rather short lived so I may continue. I just need to plan for side effects or find helps. Not sure if you can take pain meds but I took excedrine for head and neck ache almost at the end.,F,48,1  days1 small  i,9/21/2015Email,Zometa
1, 2, Stage IV BC mets to bones,"Unable to walk a day after treatment. Extreme pain in feet_ legs_ arm_ shoulders and hips.  Right foot felt crippled. Nerve pain and burning down leg and in foot. Had to use a ""walker"" to get around - on 3rd day of these side effects after 2nd treatment in 4 weeks. Also was on Femara but doctor took me off it as side effects were even worse.",I might try a smaller monthly dose to see if it lessens these awful side effects. I feel I have to try as I have 5 tumors in various bones from mets breast cancer.,F,63,30  days4 mg 1X M,10/24/2010Email,Zometa
2, 1, Bone Mets from Breast Cancer,Flu like symptoms_ edema in legs and feet_ fever_ fatigue_kidney pain.,I have been on both Aredia and Zometa. I was advised recently that current research shows a correlation between long term use of Zometa or Aredia and the development of kidney stones. My kidney stone condition is quite painful and ongoing. I am now under the care of a nephrologist and am trying to determine if there is permanent damage to my kidneys.,F,57,8  years 1X M,7/9/2010Email,Zometa
3, 3, 2nd Breast Cancer - Stage 1a,Given bi-annually.  First time was last July 2009.  Fine the day of infusion - then went to bed that night and was hit with SEVERE chills [teeth chattering with three comforters on me in the middle of the summer] which turned out to be the onset of a fever that peaked at 102.9. Fever broke the next day in the afternoon.  Then for the next 2-3 days_ muscle aches and extreme fatigue.  ONC said because of age [too young] that was why it was so bad; but promised that it would only happen for the first dose.  I had my second dose last week.  Fever of 100 for a half an hour immediately after the infusion then the fever broke in the next hour and then I was fine. Muscle aches - mild.  Fatgiue and malaise - extreme.,Make sure you get your dental work done first before the infusion.  Any drilling could cause jaw necrosis.,F,39,6  months,1/24/2010,Zometa
4, 4, Osteopenia,After first infusion_ experienced mild flu-like symptoms beginning about 24 hours after infusion_ lasting about 2 days.,Taking Femara since early stage breast cancer (lumpectomy and radiation) 3 years ago.  Dexascans show 8% and 5% bone loss over the next 2 years due to menopause and/or Femara side-effects.  Too early to know benefit yet.,F,53,2  weeks,12/10/2009,Zometa
5, 4, Stage llb Breast cancer_,I had my first infusion of Zometa 4 weeks ago and didn't experience any side effects. No flu symptoms_ no aches or pains. I had a very slight fever that was gone within 12 hours. But no other symptoms.,I had stage llb breast cancer 3 years ago. I'm in remission now after(mastectomy) chemo and radiation. I took Tamoxifen for 2 years and am now taking Arimidex. My oncologist put me on Zometa(one dose every 6 months) because I am osteopenic and she said that new studies have shown that it helps reduce your chance for recurrance. I feel pretty good and if it helps keep me in remission_ then I am all for it!,F,48,4  weeks,11/19/2009,Zometa
6, 4, early breast cancer - prevention,Had first infusion two weeks ago_ and experienced the expected flu-like symptoms the next day. Since then_ I don't notice any side effects. I am on a lot of meds_ so it is hard to tell_ but I think all is well.,I am taking infusions of 4mgs every six months. I declined chemo and radiation following a double mastectomy (one breast and three nodes involved) and am taking Tamoxifen and Lupron_ so Zometa is my insurance against future recurrence to the bone.,F,41,2  weeks,7/3/2009,Zometa
7, 3, Drug trial for breast cancer,I am on a monthly infusion of 4 mg (?) (via i.v.) and experienced very difficult breathing_ chest pains_ and high fever/chills/flu symptoms the first time around.  My oncologist then gave me dexamethazone (steroid) to counter and this works wonderfully.  I get it the day of in the infusion and expereience very little of those side effects as a result.  I am also on Effexor and Arimidex so hard to know if some nausea_ numbness_ and fatigue is a result of either of those.,I rate it 3 as it is unknown as to its effectiveness for my purpose.  I am on a 3 year trial to determine if this drug will help prevent bone metastasis for breast cancer.,F,45,4.5  months,6/22/2009,Zometa
8, 4, stage 4 breast cancer to bones,Usually after treatment_ for a couple days feel as if I am getting the flu then I have the best week of the month is the first week after treatment_ Achy bones_ joints_ feverish_ tired_ just like getting the flu.,i think I would be in terrible shape if not taking zometa_ I believe it helps me with my pain and even gives me a little zing every now and then after treatment.,F,48,4  days,5/5/2009Email,Zometa
9, 4, Breast Cancer with bone mets,Very stiff ankles and feet and to a lesser degree wrists and fingers which only started about 6 months into treatment. I feel like I have lost a lot of agility and am wearing a suit of armour. Overall though I am pain-free despite the fact that I did have pain in some places where I have lesions ie spine_ ribs before treatment.,I make sure I go for a 45min-1hr walk each day. I find being mobile helps stiffness. I think with my advanced disease I would be so much worse off if I wasn't on Zometta. I am about to start on Femara which I have read can make joint pain much worse. So fingers crossed.,F,39,7  months,10/24/2008Email,Zometa
