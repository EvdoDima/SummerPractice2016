2, 2, Find a better alternative nasal spray,Nose bleeds_ insomnia.,I used Rhinocort back when it was a prescription years ago and worked like a miracle. I recently tried the OTC version and immediately began getting nose bleeds and horrible insomnia.,F,35,5  days,4/25/2016,Rhinocort

4, 4, 3 month sinus infection,Headaches and rapid heart beat and insomnia if taken late. I am a bit foggy at times but I also put part of that as going through menopause.,It worked wonders even though the side effects were bad_ it was better being able to breath. I'm beginning to stop using the OTC nasal sprays now after about 20 years of using them and will slowly decrease using Rhinocort. I am satisfied as I was suffering way worse before taking it. Just make sure you drink lots of water daily and only spray once in each nostril as soon as they are open to breath in.,F,43,5  days1 2X D,2/23/2016Email,Rhinocort

7, 4, Chronic Allergy & Sinus Infections,Hole in/Perforated Septum,The drug worked great for what it was prescribed. Unfortunately the side effect from long term chronic use (never abused) forced me to stop using it a few years ago. I suffered from the feeling of constant sinus 'congestion' from inflammation for quite some time (many months-almost a year) after stopping use.,F,36,12  years 1X D,1/4/2016Email,Rhinocort

9, 1, Allergic Rhinitis,Leg pain_ Hand and feet chills_ loss of appetite_ severe behaviour change: normally emotionally calm son became angry_ extremely touchy_ anything made him upset_ started having temper_ which he had never had before. Usually he calms down from any upsets or disappointments with hugs and empathy_ but while taking Rhinocort 32 mg was inconsolable. I realized that he started this behaviour a few days after beginning Rhinocort. We discontinued and his behaviour changed back within 2-3 weeks or so.,This medication was prescribed for my 4.5 year-old son_ who has had Allergic Rhinitis. While it seemed to help with those symptoms_ the effect on my son's mood and emotions was frightening. Allergies seem to be better but scared about the side effects.,M,4.5,3  weeks32 2X D,8/25/2015Email,Rhinocort
10, 3, maxilliary sinus 2ndary infection,Extremely uncomfortable and regular acid reflux_ headaches all through my neck and head (not just sinuses)_ which makes it difficult to focus and be productive in any way. The side effects go away within 24 hours of ceasing the spray but return very quickly after its taken again.,This very expensive ($35/mo) product seems to have some good effect of decongesting my sinuses and allowing mucous to get washed out with sinus rinsing. So it was great for that. But these new side effects are intolerable.,M,27,3  weeks128 2X D,4/12/2015,Rhinocort
11, 1, severe nasal congestion_ allergies,Nose started bleeding after 2 days. Dry nose_ daily headaches_ weight gain. Massive increase in acid reflux symptoms.Has only improved allergy symptoms slightly. I still have to blow my nose all day long. My nose is still blocked and i have to breathe thru my mouth still. And the COST is ridiculous.After reading the other reports here i will be immediately stopping the rhinocort and never using nasal steroids again. A hole in my septum is NOT worth it.,,F,40,3  weeks128mcg,8/9/2014Email,Rhinocort

13, 3, rhinitis air bourne allergies,This worked at first very well. I was told to use it with Bactroban_ a cream antibiotic to smear in both nasal passages. But I still developed the bleeding sores and bloody boogies. Finally_ worried about a hole in my septum_ I stopped taking it on one nostril for a week and then stopped using it in the second nostril. I am all stuffed up again_ feeling spacey_ headachey_ unwell.,Rhinocort worked to lessen the effects of Rhinitis and stuffiness. It never stopped the nasal dripping - getting off ALL types of dairy produce stopped the dripping. The problem with the bleeding must be taken seriously_ however -,F,67,9  years64 1X D,3/4/2014Email,Rhinocort
14, 3, Allergy and Nose Polyp,As with others this is first med that has ever worked for me. I had drainage that became endless cough. I had a polyp. This got rid of that and I have never been able to breathe as good as i do now. But I've bern on it for about 18 months and in past few weeks noticed bloody boogers and blood in mucus when I blow. So i have stopped meds. I have not been back into dr yet but have appt. I'm hoping its not a hole in sinus but I don't think I will use the spray anymore. May try allergy shots.,,F,30,1  years2 sprays,12/16/2013,Rhinocort
15, 1, Sinusitis,Dizziness_ loss of appetite_ heart palpitations_ racing heart_ headache_ insomnia_ loss of focus.,I will never use this or any steroidal nasal spray again.  I was running 3 miles a day_ playing basketball for 45 minutes a day_ and lifting weighs. I was very healthy other than the sinus issue. I started using Rhinocort because my ENT said my sinus passages were swollen. About 2 weeks after starting_ I became very unfocused or slightly confused_ I started getting terrible headaches_ It became difficult to fall asleep and I would only sleep maybe 5-6 hrs at best. Anxiety has set in and now my heart is missing beats and racing.,M,43,2  weeks 2X D,6/3/2013Email,Rhinocort
16, 5, Seasonal Allergies,Rhinocort is the best steroidal nasal spray. It has a lower volume of mist than others (Flonase_Nasonex_ Nasacort) and is water based. It works well for me even using it QOD.,I can use it every other day_ or every second day and it is very effective. Give Rhinocort a try. It's better than the others.

17, 5, nasal blocjage,slight nasal bleeding in winter,Miracle drug. My nose used to get blocked solid_ but still runny. Drove me crazy! This helped greatly with minimal side effects_ that I notice anyway. It has no odor_ unlike some others which I find repulsive.,M,56,8  years64 1X D,3/15/2013,Rhinocort
18, 1, Sinus allergies,Horrible! My daughter had used Nasonex with terrible effects like night terrors_ agressiveness_ nausea_ joint pain... So after a year with recurrent sinus infections her doctor insisted on trying Rhinicort. She said its a lower dose so I gave it a try.After just one use_ my poor baby was extremely pale_ nauseous_ vomiting. Complaining about the same leg pain that the Nasonex gave her and also flu like symptoms. You can't feel like that in just a few hours just by a virus... Stopped the spray and will never use any steroid spray again.The doctors never believe me when I insist the spray has this serious effects. Very frustrating.,,F,6,1  days,12/6/2012Email,Rhinocort
19, 2, Allergy,For many years this drug completely eliminated my allergies and sinus troubles. It even seemed to help prevent colds. I did occasionally get nosebleeds and dry nasal passages but nothing serious.  Out of the blue I developed a severe reaction to the drug_ with extreme heart pounding and very fast racing heart. It felt as my heart had completely gone out of control.  Very scary. I bought a new batch thinking that somehow the batch was not good_  All in all I tried 3 times with 3 different refills but the reaction remained the same. this was some years ago_ i now use an electronic light device to block allergies. I would use great caution in using this medicine.  It's unclear to me if the formula was changed.,,F,59,5  years 2X D,12/2/2012,Rhinocort
20, 1, Sons allergies,My son 9 at the time took it for allergies.  He started having headaches_ dizziness_ panic attacks and slight depression.  Before taking the medication he was a happy_ normal child.  I took him to his doctor_ the hospital and got an MRI before finding research about these possible side effects on children.  A week after he stopped taking it all symptoms cleared up.,Be aware of the side effects this can cause children.  I mentioned all his headaches to his doctor and nobody felt it was caused by rhinocort_ so I did my own research and took him off the medicatiin and he cleared up.  It is very scary to have your child go through all this and you feel helpless...so just be aware of possible side effects.,F,42,60  days 1X D,8/9/2012,Rhinocort

22, 1, allergies,My 17 year old daughter starting taking this_ and at first it was working great. Then one day she woke up saying she could not breathe_ that it felt like her throat was closing up.  Then she had a panic attack also.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure out what has been wrong with her. Now that I found this site I have taken her off of it immediatly_ so I am very thankful for the people that have spoke up and told their story_ cuz as a parent i was getting very worried and didnt know what to do. So thank you to all of you out there!!!!,,F,17,7  days30mg 1X D,7/8/2012Email,Rhinocort
23, 5, allergies,None.,This is the only allergy medicine that works for me. I've been diagnosed with allergies for 15 years_ and nothing else works on my allergies.

26, 5, Nasal blockage/alergies,I havent noticed any side effects myself,I have had problems with a blocked nose especially at night and loss of taste. I had surgery after visiting an ENT specialist a few years ago but the problem started to reoccur. After going back to the doctor again she reccommended Rhinocort and it has really helped_ my snoring has even stopped. My doctor warned me to make sure the spray is taken properly and taken deep in to sinuses not to back of throat as you will just swallow the steroid_ I think that is what a lot of people might be having a problem with here ie jittery effects_ nervousness. I personally am very happy!,F,29,20  days 2X D,11/6/2011Email,Rhinocort
27, 3, sinitus,Twitching nerves_ severe itching_ hot ears_ some tingling in fingers first few days.,I was given a nasal spray to help my sinitus which was causing bad headaches and a badly blocked nasal tube. It made me itch really badly_ even after i stopped taking it - i would itch everyday. So she gave me anti-histemines to stop the itching and also gave me rhinocort and said i wouldn't itch from it. It makes me itch a hell of a lot. It drives me insane - there's nothing worse than itching. So i take doses of rhinocort and an allergy pill at the same time so i don't itch. My ears get hot_ nerves in my fingers and face twitch for ages. The only reason i gave it a rating of 3 was because i no longer get the horrible headaches and thick mucus up the left nasal passage. It's all a bit of a nightmare_ though. I hate spraying chemicals up my nose. And it looks like i'll be doing it for the rest of my life. ):,F,18,  2X D,5/28/2011Email,Rhinocort

29, 3, nasal congestion/runny nose/sneezin,It did clear up the congestion I haven't been able to manage for months with anything else but over-the-counter decongestant nose spray.I have been feeling very dizzy_ light-headed and unfocused_ quick visual movements make me nauseous_ my eyes feel very dry. I have slept 10 hours during the last few nights_ but wake up feeling completely unrested. Also feeling slightly depressed. I usually have none of the above issues and feel very healthy (minus the nose bother of course...)_ and symptoms have only appeared after use of Rhinocort.,Will try and lower usage to every other day or less to see if side effects subside. If they don't_ will still consider taking it every once in a while to break the congestion / inflammation circle.,F,29,10  days 1X D,1/9/2011,Rhinocort
30, 1, Constant blocked nose,This stuff seemed to be working well for me but then I started waking up in the middle of the night with the sensation that I'd stopped breathing.  I thought I had sleep apnoea.  During the day I felt like my throat was constricted and there was a tightness in my lungs stopping be from breathing properly.  I started having very weird dreams as well_ and even panic attacks as described by others (maybe just due to the fact I couldn't breathe properly!)  It was a little while before I made a connection between these symptoms and rhinocort_ but when I found this website I stopped taking it immediately_ and now all those symptoms have disappeared!
