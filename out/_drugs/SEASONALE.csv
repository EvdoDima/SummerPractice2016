0, 2, To delay my period for vacation,I had swelling and pain in my calves_ then the pain started to spread to my arms. It made me moody_ and not want to do anything,,F,27,7  days 1X D,5/4/2016,Seasonale
1, 1, birth control,I am 26 and have been taking the pill for ten years (mostly Tri Cyclen Lo). My blood pressure became very high (164/112) on Seasonale_ so I stopped taking it as soon as I discovered my high blood pressure (about two months into my first pack of pills)_ but it took another six weeks to normalize.  It would go down and then up again. It took so long_ I became terribly worried_ anxious_ and depressed. In addition to the high blood pressure_ I had pain in my neck - a pressured feeling in my veins that would alternate from one side of the neck to the other - since the second week of taking Seasonale. I was sent for several tests and found that one of my kidneys was also mildly swollen. Finally_ two months after quitting Seasonale_ my blood pressure is normal_ my neck pain is gone_ but I need to do another ultrasound to follow up on the kidney swelling (hydronephrosis).,I found a website with studies of Seasonale and hydronephrosis was a side effect for a small number of women. I suppose all medication reacts differently in different people_ but this really sucked for me. I was afraid for my life. I strongly recommend that anyone who tries Seasonale should monitor their blood pressure.,F,26,60  days 1X D,1/22/2016,Seasonale

4, 4, Very heavy and long periods.,Seasonale cleared up my acne almost completely_ no weight gain_ and little cramping. Sometimes I get constant horrible headaches for weeks at a time but then they clear up.,These past weeks_ since I started school again_ I've been having really bad headaches again as I did during winter last year. Im almost considering getting off the pill. But I think Id rather deal with the headaches than deal with periods every month again. But_ it does seem like the longer im on the pill the worst and longer the headaches last. But the pill does have some great benefits!,F,17,4  years.15,9/23/2015Email,Seasonale
5, 1, ovarian cysts_ painful periods,My obgyn prescribed this instead of ortho tri to keep me from getting my period and he said my cramps would get better. 4-5 months into it my cramps reduced in severity by half. This was so amazing that I didn't even notice that by 6 months in I was thinking about suicide daily. I was ungodly depressed and I picked fights w everyone_ strangers too. I really thought it was just me. It happened so gradually and I never considered my bc. Not once. I became convinced I had now developed a mood/personality disorder. I made an appt to get tested and only 100% depression came as results. I began to plan my death as it felt comforting bc i hated myself. Then my mom came to visit and she saw the change. I started to read things about seasonale. IT ALMOST MADE ME KILL MYSELF. I love myself and I life myself and I have everything to live for. But it made me lose my bf_ friends_ I lost my loans for college and I wasted a year of my life wondering WHAT HAPPENED TO ME! This particular progestin is really messed up.,TAKE WITH EXTREME CAUTION,F,34,1  yearsnormal dos,6/1/2015Email,Seasonale
6, 1, To prevent pregnancy,Awful depression_ mood swings_ lack of a sex drive_ tiredness_ numbness and tingling in toes_ feet_ and hands_ sleeplessness.,It's turned me into a different person_ and I'm on the lowest dosage.,F,26,6  months0.1/0.02,5/6/2015,Seasonale
7, 2, Endometriosis_ pregnancy prevention,Weight gain_ depression_ fatigue_ irritability & mood swings_ loss of sex drive_ IBS_ acne_ extreme itchiness (scalp_ chest & back)_ difficulty staying asleep.,I started taking seasonale 2 years ago after being on Yasmin for 8 yrs. I always wondered why I feel the way I do_ and after a heated discussion with my husband about my loss of sex drive_ I decided to do some research. Wow am I thankful I ended up here. I've never had a problem with weight gain_ or depression. I've put on 15 lbs since taking this medication_ and I am always tired & feeling depressed. I could literally sleep for days_ except I don't sleep soundly at all. I have insane dreams_ and terrible night sweats. I feel bloated_ slow_ and lethargic most of the time. I walk a lot_ and exercise regularly_ and my tummy has grown enough that I never want to wear a bathing suit again. I am newly married and should be in my PRIME but I feel like garbage! I'd rather suffer the pain of endometriosis each month than go much longer feeling like this. :(,F,27,2  years,4/1/2015Email,Seasonale
8, 5, Extremely heavy frequent periods,None except cramping during the week off the pills and mild headaches when restarting the pills. No weight gain_ no acne_ no depression - I think it may have actually made me happier and more positive. Way lighter and infrequent periods. Totally worth the mild side effects for me.,This medication has been great for me. I had extremely heavy bleeding and huge blood clots that made it hard to do anything for 7-8 days out of 20. I also had iron deficiency. I've been taking this for 5 years and it's been amazing only having periods four times a year. Also_ they're way lighter and more manageable.,F,24,5  years 1X D,3/13/2015,Seasonale
9, 1, To get my period less_ convenience.,I'm sure everyone's reaction to this pill is different but after reading all of the negative comments about the pill I feel like I've been a part of some strange sorority of tortured women taking the same drug! Almost all of everyone's symptoms I've had. Anxiety_ depression_ severe mood swings_ panic attacks! 2 years ago I went through a divorce_ it was a cake walk compared to this!! I went off the pill 3 weeks ago and I'm Ortho-Tricyclen Lo now and my life is SO much better! I feel like I've come out of a fog! Don't suffer through this drug if you've had these symptoms ladies. Change!,,F,37,3  days,3/8/2015Email,Seasonale
10, 1, Endometriosis,I just stopped taking it. I thought I was going crazy. I kept thinking about my symptoms individually_ then I found this website and the mass array of symptoms I was having a lot of the women on here errrr having as well. Night sweats_ deep cystic acne_ back pain_ blurred vision_ itchy skin_ hive like rash on my chest neck and even my scalp. I thought I was allergic to something!! None of my docs in years ever thought it might be the birth control :/ I just stopped taking it and already I notice my skin is clearing up and not as itchy. I've been so overwhelmed with all of these weird things going on with me. I don't really feel like myself. I feel worn out_ and absolutely NO sex drive. It's like I'm just going thru the motions to get thru life...excited to be back to normal_ but very angry all at the same time.,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.,F,32,4  years30 mg,3/3/2015Email,Seasonale
11, 1, Less peroids,Depressed_ unfeeling_ sad for no reason _ no sex drive....frustrated.  I'm glad I found this website_ I thought I was alone and wasn't sure if it was the BC or not.,I'm so frustrated that this had to change me so much.. I hate having such heavy periods so often_ but would rather have them then feel this way anymore.,F,40,28  days0.15mg 1X D,1/13/2015Email,Seasonale
12, 3, Less periods,No spotting_ sex drive hard to tell due to my busy life style_ no pains_ occasional nausea_ but nothing to worry about. Unfortunatly the biggest thing was gain weight of 10 lb average and Zumba classes did not help at all.,,F,37,90  days 1X D,1/11/2015,Seasonale
13, 1, birth control,40 day bleeding_ gained 20 lbs,Seriously the worst. Was told to keep taking it to see if side effects would subside_ they aren't. Each 3 month pack i've bled for at least 30 days. Birth control isn't much good if I can't have sex! I've also always been small framed (100-110) and am now sitting at 125 with no losing it. Have been on Yaz since i was 16 with no weight gain ever. UGHHHHH.,F,27,9  months.15 mg,12/29/2014,Seasonale
14, 2, Regulate periods,weight gain_ increased appetite_ severe depression,I took this for 4 years. The first year was rough. I had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and a lot of spotting. My doctor just kept telling me to wait it out and my body would adjust. It took nearly a year_ but I did get adjusted. With every period I did experience the bloating and the cramps. It was always really bad for the first 2 days then my period was almost gone. The period only lasted maybe 5 days at most. So all that was ok...I always had depression to some degree so I thought it was just me. But while I was on this birth control I was extremely_ severely depressed. I mean_ I was suicidal at times. I never put 2 and 2 together until I went off of it 4 months ago and I have not had a single bad moment. I've been happier than I can remember ever being. So this helped regulate my periods which was great_ but it made me so off balance that it's not worth it. My husband told me he never wants me to go back on birth control again because of how different I am.,F,27,4  years 1X D,12/2/2014Email,Seasonale
15, 2, Birth Control/ Regulate Periods,Weight gain_ Discharge_ Breakthrough Bleeding_ Acne_ Mood Swings_ Bloating,Tried to give this multiple chances and I just couldn't do it anymore. Had breakthrough bleeding every two months for the entire time. I had clear skin until a month into taking the pill_ then it was pimple after pimple. Also notice increased appetite_ and some weird changes in emotions. If you can handle this stuff you are lucky! But just keep in mind this pill isn't for everyone.,F,20,1  years,11/5/2014,Seasonale
16, 2, Heavy periods,I already struggled with depression but taking these pills worsened it. I get spaced out and lack concentration when i go out doors. I do have anxiety problems but its gotten worse since taking Seasonale. I hate being around people_ i get angry at times and bitchy. I have this numb feeling and disattachment feeling.,,F,20,2  weeks0.15,10/12/2014Email,Seasonale
17, 3, ovarian cysts,Im taking the generic version called quasense. Within a week I immediately noticed a severe drop in my sex drive which took about a month to go back to normal. my breasts were also extremely sore to the point where id be in tears. By the start of the second pack I had pretty bad fatigue and no amount of sleep seemed to kick it. I also experienced lots of dreaming (i normally have dreamless sleep) which made my sleep even less satisfying. By the beginning of the third pack I had break through bleeding that lasted 6 days and was there just enough to be annoying. Not even 2 full weeks later_ I am having breakthrough bleeding again and now im experiencing chest pain and heart burn that is really starting to worry me. However_ the cyst that I was originally put on  the bc for is now gone and I am thankful for that part.,,F,24,2  months,8/21/2014,Seasonale

24, 1, Diagnosed with endometriosis,Horrid experience with seasonale. Brownish painful discharge for 1 month straight_ random full periods_ Not just spotting. And now ACNE! I've never suffered from acne until taking seasonale. The ONLY thing it helped was my pain during sexual activity caused by endometriosis. I'd rather have the pain than the long_ heavy periods and unattractive back acne. Definitely DO NOT recommend.,,F,20,5  days,2/22/2014Email,Seasonale
25, 5, having 4 menses cycles a year,The only side effect that I do not like Is the fact that when i do get my cycle its a little heavier...same amount of cramps though. Overall its very close to being perfect but i will continue to use this as my bc. And in this year i havent experienced depression_ anxiety or any heart problems...different reactions for different bodies.,,F,32,1  years,1/25/2014Email,Seasonale
26, 1, For BC and 4 Menstrual Cycles a yr,Painful cramping with first period on the pill_ shortness of breath_ heart palpitations and heart racing_ horrible panic attacks_ depression_ and headaches.,I would not recommend this BC to ANYONE_ I have tried many different BC's with my favourite being Tri-Cyclen Lo. This has to be the absolute worst BC I've ever tried. I had depression so bad I would leave my work and go home to cry. I hated everyone and everything. My husband and I were at the movie theatre ready to watch a movie in 3D (like we have done many times b4) and I had a panic attack so bad we had to leave 10 minutes into the movie I thought I was going to die. Heart was racing I could feel it through my winter jacket_ everything seemed loud_ I was sweating and shaking...I have NEVER experienced anything like this b4. Not to mention the daily heart palpitations/racing that make me short of breath on a daily basis. This BC was ver yscary and I would advise anyone thinking of going on it to find a different brand. I have been off it for 2 weeks now and the depression is gone_ I have only had one mild panic attack_ and the heart palpitations/racing is less frequent......I am hoping all this will go away once the birth control is completely out of my system.,F,27,4  months 1X D,3/11/2013Email,Seasonale
27, 4, Prevent pregnancy,I been taking seasonale for 4 years now_  the break through bleeding only happens for the first few months_  maybe 5/6. I hardly ever experience break through bleeding now.  Seasonale cleared up my acne_ and helped me with weight loss. I do get bloated sometimes_ but only mostly before and during my period. My periods are soo light its like nothing and my premenstrual cramps are half as bad as they used to be and occur 3-4 days before my 7 day cycle begins. I have noticed some discharge and a lack in sex drive however_ and can be very moody at times. The biggest side effect I noticed was hair growth.  My hair does NOT grow at all now_ all hair. Legs_  arms_ hair on my head :-( iv been trying to go my hair out the whole time and it just won't grow!  Overall I like seasonale however I will be coming off it in about a year!  Hope this helped you all!,,F,19,4  years,1/28/2013,Seasonale
28, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Chest pain_ depression_ anxiety_ paranoid thoughts_ break through bleeding_ tender breasts. I used this for 4 weeks bleed for three of them very heavily. Started to feel depressed and paranoid and I had no past history of that. I had shortness of breath and felt like I was having a heart attack. Went of it after that and within 2 days felt better_ like I was coming out of a fog. I had been on tricyclen for 10 years and nothing like this happened. I thought I was going crazy!

When I finally got to the end of the pack I ended having another period for three days which was nice_ however it was extremely painful. When I went to the pharmacy to get a refill they said it was on back order so I called almost every pharmacy in my area and they all said it was unavailable. Not only was taking this drug an awful experience_ but trying to find it was impossible. I decided to switch to Aviane because it seemed more reliable.

54, 2, Lessen hormonal migraine and BC,ACNE Breakouts_ still had migraines_ breakthrough bleeding lasting 3 weeks.,I started taking the generic of this because I get hormonal migraines the week I am on the sugar pills in a BC pack.  So I thought this may help relieve the migraines.  Well it didn't.  I still had migraines even when I was on the active pills. I also had break through bleeding that lasted 3 weeks.  And the worst of it was_ the acne break out.  It was all over my chest_ back_ face_ neck... Horrible!,F,40,4  months 1X D,2/12/2012Email,Seasonale
55, 1, endometriosis,anxiety_ constipation_ exhausted_ extreme bloating,I have been on birth control for almost 10 years_ and have just recently been having horrible cramps_ my doctor put me on the generic of seasonale for cramping. I am an ER nurse and work long hours on my feet_ exercise everyday_ and I'm a healthy vegetarian. I hate this pill. Over the last couple weeks I am so irritable that I can not even stand to go to work!!! I love my job and lately I have been so horrible to get along with. I feel like its making me crazy_ not to mention I've put on 5 pounds in 2 weeks and I have been the same weight since I was in high school. Not happy with this and going off of it immediately for the sake of my patients and my mental health!,F,27,1  months 1X D,2/12/2012Email,Seasonale
56, 1, ,MIGRAINES!! headaches_ vomiting an hour after taking_ exhausted/tired.,I wanted to get on birth control to prevent my cramps_ but didn't know it could come with such a price...... (bum bum bum) DO NOT take this pill!!! I became a major hormonal biatch_ my poor roommate had to deal with my crazy self. I am the happiest girl you'll ever meet_ but became a beast after being on this for only two weeks. I am getting off this pill tonight after reading this reviews. I do not care wtf my gyno is telling me_ they can suck it. Being a college student and taking this pill_ was not a good life choice. I usually get my period for 4 days but had it for over 10 with this pill_ I know you should give it a few months to regulate. But I do not feel like my self anymore_ serious mood swings! DO NOTTTT reccomend,F,19,2  weeks 1X D,1/27/2012Email,Seasonale

59, 4, Heavy periods,After two years of being on seasonale and two previous years on a different BC I developed a general anxiety disorder. Im not sure if it was because of the BC but after reading many of these comments it leads me to believe it is. I stopped taking it about two months ago and my parents have told me Im a completely different person now way happier and alot less moody. I also have not been having as many panic attacks and my anxiety is alot lower,,F,20,2  years 1X D,1/13/2012Email,Seasonale
