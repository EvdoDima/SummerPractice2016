7, 1, High cholesterol,Mostly leg soft tissue injuries and cramps to feet. The worst though has been the strange stomach and organ spasms and pain. Improved immediately I stopped the 40mg does the Dr put me on. On a 10mg dose for 18 months before symptoms returned and even worse. Have just taken myself off and immediately much improved. Not more organ spasms but still dull pain throughout upper stomach area. Seeing the Dr. tomorrow to request tests to see what this poison has done to me.,For years my symptoms of memory loss and muscle issues were dismissed as signs of ageing.

9, 1, High cholesterol,After being on Crestor for 5 weeks I broke out in urticaria. Insanely itchy skin and lumps which started like a mosquito bite but over time spread into welts. Also the muscles in my legs started to lose their muscle tone. After three weeks working with the doctor trying to control the rash which he thought was eczema I lay awake one itchy night and read the patient leaflet about Crestor and it said a known but uncommon side effect was extremely itchy skin with raised red lumps_ said it's an ellergic reaction and stop taking immediately.,I continued with this medication for three weeks before realising I was allergic to it. I now feel like I've poisoned myself. It's only two days since I stopped taking Crestor and I'm much improved. No more feeling like hoards of ravenous ants are racing under my skin at night and the rash is diminishing. In a few more days it should hopefully be all gone.

Very sore feet and body every morning_ tired by noon_ completely fatigued by late afternoon.,Tried another generic statin but had severe aches and pains in joints and muscles_ this should have been reason enough not to try Crestor but the doctor considered that if I had a problem with the first one_ it just wasn't expensive enough so I should go to the top shelf. Actually_ one reason not to prescribe Crestor is an adverse reaction to another drug in the same class. GP said pain in joints not a side affect but he is wrong.

Tried it once more.  Felt horrible.  The neck pain that I thought was my thyroid acting up_ I'm sure now was caused by the Crestor.  Right in the middle of my neck.  That pain had gone away after I stopped taking Crestor (but I thought I should get it checked out).  When I took the second dosage of Crestor_ yep_ it came back again.

41, 1, reduce cholesterol levels,From the get-go I experienced leg weakness_ cramping _numbness and pain. Initially was on 20 mg then after several months my cardiologist bumped up the daily dose to 40mg.....symptoms magnified greatly.....my compaints fell on deaf ears and he insisted I maintain the dose which I stupidly adhered to. Muscle mass became highly evident from a once athletic frame. CK levels of 1200 substantiated loss of muscle mass and myopathy. Family practioner through a recent blood test picked up on the high level of CK and attributed loss of muscle as related to the symptoms was most likely caused by Crestor. Next stop is to get the cardiologist to prescribe another statin and abandon Crestor  ...... and also monitor blood levels lest I drop the cardiologist and seek cardio expertise elsewhere.,I need to get off this disabling drug and recapture life as it was before using this dreaded crippling drug.,M,72,3  years40mg 1X D,6/17/2015,Crestor

My blood sugar came down rapidly (3 days) when I stopped taking the Crestor. Now my doctor believes me that it was not diet and exercise that would help me. Some day medications will be tailored to your DNA not one size fits all!,It does drasticly lower your cholesterol.  The results are not worth the long term side effect and serious muscle damage_ plus possible heart damage. Additionally for a diabetic to take one medicine to make your muscles use sugar it is counter productive to take Crestor that inhibits the muscles form operating normally.

I feel damaged and not properly notified of these potential and dangerous side effects.,F,68,6  years10mg 1X D,3/2/2015,Crestor
59, 1, Slightly elevated choelesterol leve,First let me say ; I have lupus and fibromyalgia_ so any pain I have my doc at the time would blame the pain on my condition. Until 2 yrs ago I could barely walk because my right hip and thigh hurt so badly it felt like it was broken ; could barely put any weight on that foot or the pain would shoot from the hip all the down to my calf. The same pain was present when I sat or tried to lie on the right side. Also found myself becoming very forgetful and having pain in my right side. The doc at that time told me I could not stop the Crestor ; to make this long story short I've been off the Crestor now for 6 days! Yes! I stopped this nasty drug pain still in right leg but nowhere near as bad as it is while taking this drug I can't say what will happen but my mind seems a bit clearer I'll see what happens. I have a new doc now and I will let her know next week that I stopped taking the Crestor _ I still don't like this feeling I have in my right side _ hopefully it hasn't destroyed my liver or kidney.,I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS DRUG FOR ANYONE_ the manufactures should be ashamed for putting this dangerous drug on the market just to make big bucks!,F,60,6  years10mg,2/28/2015Email,Crestor
