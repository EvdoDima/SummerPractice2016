0, 3, depression anxiety_ panic,I am getting off Pristiq now to get on Nardil.  PLEASE tell me it will work.  I have tried it all this year...except antipsychotics.

1, 3, Treatment resistant depression,Lots of side effects: hypotension_ insomnia at night_ sleepiness during the day_ lack of sex drive_ headaches and dizziness initially that have since gone away.  But by far the worst side effect so far is the muscle tension.  I curl my toes as tight as they'll go_ my jaw clenches uncontrollably_ the muscles under my chin clench_ my hands sometimes curl and distort.  I'm a little concerned that it's some kind of tardive dyskensia but I left a message for my doctor 5 days ago and told him if I need to change something or stop taking it to let me know.  So far he hasn't gotten back to me so obviously these symptoms aren't too worrisome for him.  No one else has posted these symptoms except a couple with jaw clenching.  Anyone else experience these?  Do they go away with time?,Seems to be helping sometimes but other times I'm right back to feeling worse.  Not sure yet about it's efficacy.,F,31,1  months75 3X D,3/2/2016Email,Nardil

These cramps are quite severe and take about 15 minutes or more to subside.,I have tried many anti-depressants from all families_ but always come back to Nardil. It has been the best medication for me. It initially gives me a boost_ but after a prolonged period of time this medication plateaus. It's important for me not to stop taking it because I'm feeling better .. I must continue the meds. Being a very old anti-depressant_ I have to let the pharmacist know I need a refill ahead of time; sometimes it needs to be ordered in.,M,62,15  years60 mg 1X D,1/13/2016,Nardil

4, 5, Depression_ Anxiety,Constipation_ Inorgasmia_ weight gain.,Brilliant medication. Completely eradicated my depression and almost all of my anxiety. No social phobia when on this medication! For a while I was in an almost constant euphoric state. Still works well after 12 years. Side effects are tolerable and can be managed_ and most go after a while. The dietary restrictions are hardly even noticeable.   MAOI's obliterate SSRI's.  Nardil is an excellent medication_ safe and VERY effective.,M,36,12  years30 2X D,8/15/2015,Nardil

9, 3, Anxiety / Depression,Insomnia_ weight gain (15 lbs)_ bloating_ constipation_ sexual dysfunction_ fatigue_ low blood pressure,Nardil worked well the first time I took it_ which lasted for a year until it didn't seem to help me when stress at work was getting bad.  I switched to Marplan_ which was awful_ and then to Parnate.  After about nine months on Parnate I became chronically fatigued_ had trouble concentrating_ and felt agitated all the time (too much NE)_ and eventually left my job due to poor work performance and worsening symptoms.  I eventually switched back to Nardil_ but it never worked like it did the first time I took it.  When my pdoc and I pushed the dose to 75 mg I became hypomanic and very irritable/aggressive.  I eventually experienced a mixed state that lasted for a few weeks.  I also experienced brain zaps while coming off Nardil_ which I've never experienced before with any other meds (Parnate was a pain to discontinue_ also).  I discontinued the drug quicker than recommended_ over the course of about 2-3 weeks.,M,34,5  months30 2X D,2/24/2015EmailHistory,Nardil

Over time the psychiatrist was prescribing so many other drugs to combat the side effects; Florinef to keep my blood pressure up and stop the fainting_ Sleeping pills and anti anxiety pills so I could sleep_ vitamins for my electrolytes that were tanking and finally an anti psychotic!  I became more sick on this drug than without it.  After passing out and not coming to this time I was rushed to the hospital.  I saw a psychiatrist there who told me that my dose was too high and I was having a toxic reaction_ not becoming psychotic.  He took me off the drug and while I still had to deal with the depression_ all the side effects vanished and I didn't need all the other drugs.

This drug has helped me get my life back and given me the energy and mood stability to get into therapy which is making an additional world of a difference.  Depression is 90% gone and social phobia 65% gone with Nardil Alone.  I can get out of bed and naturally start thinking what I want to accomplish today.  My motivation to do things is back.

22, 3, Treatment-Resistant Depression,Severe swelling of legs & feet; chills; insomnia; blood pressure in the 70/40 range; frequently close to fainting,I recently ended up in the ER as I fainted upon getting out of bed in the morning and did not come to for over 20 minutes by which time my husband had called an ambulance.  It was determined by consults with both psychiatrists and internists that this episode was caused directly by the Nardil and it was imperative I begin weaning off of it as it was far too dangerous for me to be on with the way I responded physically.   My heart rate was in the 40's and blood pressure when going from lying down to stand was in the 70's/40's.  A month previous to this I had lowered my daily dose to 45 mg and the swelling became minimal but the other issues remained.  And my mood and ability to function also decreased very noticeably.  So I am beginning to slowly taper off with no idea what I will try next as i have been on just about every other drug in every conceivable combination and dosage.,F,,4  months30 mg 2X D,10/23/2012Email,Nardil

24, 4, Major depression,Weight gain_ nausea_ horrible taste in my mouth due to change in coating in 2003_ dry mouth. Four hypertensive crises in 30 years due to eating spoiled chicken and/or ketchup.,"The doctor who prescribed Nardil saved my life. I had been having panic attacks_ deep episodes of depression_ and heavy depersonalization. I have been on as little as 60 mg_ but mostly maintained on 90 mg. I  would be lying if I said that it made me feel 100% better; it's more like 65-70%. The panic attacks are completely gone. I do suffer insomnia_ however_ and even moving the Nardil to earlier in the day has not helped. Yes_ it took about 4-6 weeks to kick in. The way my doc described it was that my ""depressed palor"" had disappeared_ but the greatest relief was that I no longer had severe panic attacks -- and those had been the worst of it. You have to be very committed to taking this drug because of all the food and drug interactions. There is a steep learning curve_ but once you experience feeling human again_ having to remember a lot becomes easier. If you're just starting on Nardil_ please give it time. I promise it will work for you. If you need to_ put up a wall calendar and mark off days. By around 4 weeks_ it will start to kick in because the blood level of the drug will be growing. Remember_ it IS worth the wait_ and YOU are worth the time it takes -- even if you have to take a leave from your job or your life.

28, 1, Severe Post Traumatic Stress/Depres,As I increased dose fainting and seizures started becoming a problem. Ended up in the Emergency Room after having 2 bad episodes in the space of 3 hours. I naturally have quite low blood pressure 120/50 but my blood pressure was dropping to under 90. In the emergency room_ through consultation with my GP and Psychiatrist it was agreed to drop dosage down to 30 mg twice per day. A week after being in the ER I had an unstoppable seizure_ went from arms_ legs and head flailing about uncontrollably to being stiff as a board_ neck back. An ambulance was called_ they were unable to stop the seizure so called for a second ambulance. They put a breathing tube down my throat in case everything seized up. By the time I arrived at the hospital I was unable to breath and the seizure contunued. I was placed in an induced coma in the Intensive Care Unit for 2 days and then was placed in the Critical Care Medical Ward for a further 2 weeks. I had one more seizure while undergoing rehabilitative Physi,Prior to all the horrendously bad stuff happening_ when I was taking my full dose of 90mg per day I was feeling the best I had ever felt_ certainly not 100% but soooo much better. When the dosage was dropped to 60mg per day_ I noticed a considerable downturn in my mood and behaviours - Binging on food_ feeling miserable again_ terrified to leave the house_ buying random things uncontrollably.Would I recommend Nardil?

Unless the joy for life I have really is mania or true euphoria_ in which case I welcome it. I am going to tell my doctor to stop prescribing other ad's as this is the only he should really ever use. I've tried everything and this is the only drug where I have seen a noticeable difference. It felt like waking up from a nightmare.

Without this drug_ I may have ended up an ECT victim or ending my own life.  In 10 years_ the MAOI drugs (Parnate_ and Nardil) are the only things that have touched my depression.  I went off Nardil before due to the weight gain - if this happens to you_ I strongly advise you don't do what I did and stop taking it.  I am just fortunate it has worked for me again.  I tried every SSRI on the market_ Effexor_ Wellbutrin_ Remeron_ Lithium_ Lamictal - nothing has worked as well as this drug which has relieved most of my severe_ treatment-resistant depression and anxiety.  It makes me feel normal_ feel like engaging in meaningful activity_ and returning to work eventually.  If you've tried modern antidepressants and they haven't helped_ or haven't helped enough_ you owe it to yourself to give Nardil or Parnate a try.

I had just transferred to a university and the drug trials were profoundly ruining my life for a year. There is no other way to explain the experience other than mental torture. Nardil saved me. The only reason I had almost every side effect to extreme degrees was because I increased to 90mg/day after only 1 week at a lower dose.

While there are still the occasional down days_ I no longer have major depressive episodes.  I do often have ADD-like symptoms_ but never hypomania_ and since I concurrently take 200mg daily of Provigil_ the cause has not been attributed to one or the other drugs_ or is perhaps a combination of the two.  I would like to comment on the diet restrictions:  Being the personality type that has to push the boundaries in order to know the playing field_ as it were_ upon initially taking Nardil I consumed foods from the restricted list_ slowly at first until there were no restricted that I don't consume freely.  In four years I have had one hypertensive event where I asked my wife to drive me to the ER when my BP meter indicated a BP of 180 over 250.  Upon arrival_ my BP was normal.  I had been told that in an MAOI related crisis_ my BP would not have returned to normal this quickly or without intervention.  Was it the Nardil? No one knows_ although an hour before checking my BP at home I had consumed nearly 8oz of Societe Roquefort cheese and nearly the same quantity of dry spicy Italian salami_ so it is probable.  My psch doctor and everything I've read had prepared me for specific symptoms that included being nauseous or vomiting_ severe headache_ etc.  The only symptom that signaled concern was an odd feeling that I hadn't experienced before which made me think to check my BP,M,62,4  years45mg 1X D,1/2/2011,Nardil

47, 1, Depression,DEATH - my friend died from this drug.,My friend was taking Nardil for depression. She had an allergy and took half an antihistamine. Her blood pressure shot up_ she got a cerebral hemorrhage and died after being in a coma for 2 weeks. This drug is VERY DANGEROUS and should not be prescribed to anyone.,F,32,2  years15 4X D,10/31/2010,Nardil
48, 5, social anxiety,insomnia_lack of libido_headaches_tremor-all gone now and probably went after i was slowly increased to 45mg a day,an excellent drug for social anxiety-when you first take it you are invincible_have verbal diohrea_can talk to strangers about anything(nardil nonsense!)nothing phases you.this eurphoric stage last a few weeks and then you mellow out to a normal stage where the drug just does its job and side effects are then minimal-i have had no issues with any food-i drink alcohol_eat pepperoni_mature cheese in moderation_dont be put off by these very outdated food restrictions,M,45,2  years15mg 3X D,10/13/2010Email,Nardil
49, 5, Bipolar 2 & Social Anxiety,Insomnia_ constipation_ low blood pressure_ lower libido_ in past 5 years_ due to Nardil causing high adrenaline levels_ blood pressure would spike high after evening dose; that is under control now.,To date_ Nardil is the only anti-depressant I can take.  I have tried many others and am treatment resistant.  Nardil has been a life saver for me in spite of some of the side effects.,F,45,19  years30.7 1X D,9/20/2010,Nardil
50, 5, bi-polar depression,lack of sleep and rem sleep_ headaches,this drug saved my life. i was suicidal and i came out of it in three days with a 15mg dose increase. i was out of all options. even more effective then the ect treatments. The only major stressor is the lack of sleep. But I hope to reduce my dose to a maintenance dose soon. Meanwhile_ I am living again and in peace.,F,42,1  days90 mg 1X D,8/21/2010,Nardil
51, 5, Treatment Resistant Depression_ GAD,Excessive sweating_ carb cravings,After two years of trying every anti-depressant known to man_ my P-Doc mentioned MAOI's as a last resort.  He said they were not prescribed often because of the dietary restrictions_ but I was desperate for relief. Nardil has been a wonder drug and a savior-My anhedonia has been replaced by motivation and enjoyment and I don't need Klonopin to battle anxiety.  The dietary restrictions are so minimal I can't believe that anyone with depression would not make the trade-off.  Full relief in exchange for no aged cheese_ pepperoni and soy sauce is a no-brainer in my book.  I can't recommend this medicine enough.,M,55,1.5  months60mg 1X D,8/13/2010Email,Nardil
52, 2, Atypical Depression,Repeated fainting/falling upon standing that didn't seem to go away with time resulting in many bruises & bumps to the head. Tiredness during day. Complete lack of headaches (good). Wanting to sleep all the time. Super low blood pressure even after activity. General coordination problems at 60mg which I was only at briefly-even trouble staying in lane while driving.,I think it was helping with my depression_ but the low blood pressure/fainting/falling was too dangerous & unnerving to remain on a therapeutic dose. I am on 22.5 mg now just to get by till my next dr's appt. Parnate is next. No food interactions_ but I stayed away from restricted foods. Still feel it is worth trying for anyone that hasn't responded to other meds.,F,35,90  days15mg 3X D,6/14/2010Email,Nardil
53, 5, Migraines and depression,Insomnia_ euphoria_ weight loss_ possibly tardive dyskinesia,"I've taken 4 courses of Nardil over 15 years. It quit working after 1 year except this time. Works extremely well for both migraines (the only prophylactic treatment that has) and depression. Staying hydrated increases effectiveness markedly - at least 1/2 gallons of fluids a day_ 3/4 is better. Keep Nardil ""foods_ meds_ and supplements to avoid"" list readily available for family_ friends_ doctors and ERs. [***You may contact me for very complete MS Excel worksheet***] You literally can't be too careful. While being prepped for a procedure the OR clinician decided to use lidocaine w/ epi (epinepherine) as opposed to the lidocaine I had approved_ on the spur of the moment! I intervened and he argued with me!! Had to get the doc to confirm my wishes. Review & insist on approval for all meds to be given in a hospital/ER setting.",M,55,2  years30 2X D,6/4/2010Email,Nardil
54, 5, In the 1980's for Major Depression,My side effects were mostly all GOOD with Nardil when I took it back in the mid-eighties for a major depression. No other meds at the time helped me..of course now in 2010 they have a lot of other meds..but none that I have taken have helped like Nardil did. I did have ONE High BP episode when I ate a very small piece of Kilbasa (my mistake). Headache for hours b/c of a spike in BP..but it went away. I also lost weight due to the strict dietary requirements_ so that was a plus.,I wish I could take it again now (2010) for depression_ but b/c of some health problems that I didn't have years ago_ the doctor won't give it to me. That drug saved my life. I told the doctor at the time who prescribed it that I would walk out in the AM and hear the birds singing..things were SO CLEAR. Amazing..and powerful drug. Within 3 mths of starting Nardil_ I had a job_ lost weight (I needed to lose a lot) and had more energy than I had in years. I thank God for my doctor at the time for trying this drug on me. Please becareful of the dietary restrictions and OTC meds you can't take with it. :) Take Care.,F,48,15  months15-20? 1X D,4/16/2010Email,Nardil
55, 5, Treatment-resistant depression,Side effects I have are weight gain and insomnia.  Nardil is the only med that worked.  (I take Abilify and others_ too).  I can't get the weight off no matter what I do.  I eat like a bird and exercise (not enough_ I guess).  HAS ANYONE HAD SUCCESS LOSING  WEIGHT AND TAKING NARDIL?!  PLEASE ADVISE.  Thank you.

Combined with olanzapine it is powerful_ only have a few depressed days a month now instead of constant dysthymia. Social anxiety is lowered but not eradicated.
