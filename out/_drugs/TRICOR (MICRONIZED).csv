0, 1, High Triglicerdies,Severe weakness in left arm and shoulder - some in right side -trouble walking at times - feel terribly weak - a little concentration issues cropping up - increased lower back pain - chills - it's August and I am wearing sweats at night to stay warm - trouble concentrating - pills get stuck in my throat.My BP is great. I know why my tri's were so darn high_ I have been drinking Walgreen's brand of Ensure like crazy for months. I easily would go through 2 cases a month. It is loaded with sugar and carbs.I stopped drinking it_ stopped sugar in my coffee (using Splenda)_ honey in my oatmeal_ taking Flax Seed oil_ chewing Omega 3 gummies (I have a very hard time taking pills - they get caught in my throat since having an infection and scarring in my epiglottis plus scarring from GERD) These things_ the Tricor_ get caught in my throat about half the time,I have a failed lumbar fusion and Severe Chronic Neutropenia. I have enough going on as well as a an ill family member who needs me at my best right now.I test my hand strength during these episodes when this weakness thing starts. Equal. I perform basic neurological tests to make sure this is not something else - like touch my nose with each finger while arms out stretched_ touching thumbs to fingers_ each hand going at the same time_ challenging a different pattern (both hands doing the same thing)I grin repeatedly to see if one side of my face is weaker - equal and strong.So_ it has to be this damn drug. I hate it. I will take anything but thisPlus_ I am at my coverage gap/doughnut hole on my part D - no way i can keep taking it_ even if it wasn't making my life difficult.,M,57,2  weeks145 1X D,8/31/2015Email,Tricor (micronized)
1, 1, high cholesterol/triglycerides,liver shut-down,I began to lose weight after taking this drug. After about four months my urine began to darken.

4, 1, Hypertriglyceridemia Tri level 660,Photosensitivity (sensitivity to sun light)_ I developed a very itchy skin rash on the back of my neck and forearms. It got worst as with continued exposure to sun.,There were no side effects at first. I exercise very often (indoors) and spend most of my time studying. After being on the medication for a little over 2 months_ I began to develop a rash on the back of my neck and around my ears. It progressively became more itchy. I thought it was a rash from some fungus I may have picked up at the gym. I tried Hydrocortisone for a week with no relief. The rash began to spread to my forearms and top of my hand. The itch was become unbearable_ so I made an appointment with my doctor who told me stop taking the medicine. The rash began to dissipate as long as I was out of the sun. A week later and I still have some sensitivity to sun light. Also_ my triglycerides decreased by 20 mg. Not much..,M,26,2.5  months 1X D,4/3/2014,Tricor (micronized)

7, 1, High Tri at 200+,My dr prescribed me of this med because he said that I have high risk of heart problem because my father died of it. After taking this med for just 2 days I had already experience dull back pain and arm pain. I thought it was just because of my recent workout in the gym but seem odd because I never felt that way before. After 4th day it worsen and I started checking if this med is causing it. To my surprise_ I was really risking everything just to lower my tri. I immediately stopped taking the med and after just 40 hours all pain went away. I will instead try to workout everyday and control my diet than to endure severe side effect of this med. I will return to my dr this weekend to report this. Not worth it.,,M,27,4  days200,9/12/2013Email,Tricor (micronized)
8, 1, High Triglycerides,Severe gas/bloating_ frequent bowel movements_ flu-like symptoms_ body aches_ persistent low grade headache_ coughing_ pain in large muscles of legs_ feel like doo-doo.,"My doctor is obsessed with my cholesterol. My total is 250 (should be under 200)_ HDL 42 (should be 46 or higher)_ LDL 161 (should be under 130)_ Triglycerides 237 (should be under 150.) Now_ to me_ these numbers are not that terrible. If he'll be patient with me I can get them down through diet and exercise. But he tests me every 4-6 months. I was unable to tolerate ANY type of statin due to the same symptoms I am now experiencing with Fenofibrate (generic form of Tricor.) I think I lasted less than a week on even the lowest dose_ gentlest form of statins. I must be hyper-sensitive to the effects of cholesterol lowering medications because within 48 hours of taking any of them_ the symptoms start. When I quit the drug_ I go back to normal almost immediately. So that makes me realize that it will not do for me to ""push through"" these symptoms just to see my numbers look better on a lab test. Heck_ there is evidence and debate that lower cholesterol even helps prevent heart attacks and heart disease. There is even a disclaimer on many of the web pages I read about his drug_ stating such. I would rather have a good quality of life than have numbers that look good to a doctor. Stay off statins and Tricor if you want a good life. As a side note_ I will add that statins can cause early onset dementia or confusion and brain fog. My mother developed early onset Alzheimer's and to this day we wonder if her statin use was partly to blame.",F,51,2  days145mg 1X D,8/1/2013Email,Tricor (micronized)
9, 1, Triglicerides,Tricor and Triipex Meds experience. Started with rash itchy palms then hives only to spread around to any place warm on my body. Then went to xtream shoulder pain and weekness.Brushing own teeth was a issue  the only relieve was to take benydrel but it only helped the swelling and itching the pain was almost unbearable in the shoulders . Then six years later another Dr. wanted to treat the Triglycerides with another medicine this time I was prescibed Trilipex had the same symtoms but it occured a lot sooner then  with tricor but the same miserable results. Note  Pain seems to migrate from one spot to another rapidly.,Tricor or Trilipex  .   Take these with caution . if you have any kind of weard side affects I recommend you stop taking abruptly and to expect one week of severe issues slowly subsiding over time to full recovery . Asperin and benidril will help no icy hot or anything like that on joints it only seem to make the pain worse. Hot water run over joint pain seem to be a quick relief.,M,53,14  days135 1X D,12/31/2012,Tricor (micronized)

14, 3, ,I'm having some stomach discomfort and nausea_ especially in the morning_ and I'm not sure if it's related_ but I've also had an acne breakout.......,My triglicerides were 681 and my overall cholesterol was 305 when I went for routine blood work about 3 1/2 weeks ago_ which is incredibly high and alarming since I'm only 26 yrs old and in good shape and work out and watch my diet_ especially when it comes to fatty foods. Both of my parents are on statin drugs because they have high cholesterol_ my mother's on lipitor and my father's on crestor_ and the doctor said my high cholosterol is more genetic than anything. And btw_ I also was misinformed and thought Tricor was a statin drug_ the doctor also told me that it isn't in that class. It is in a class of drugs known as phenofibrates (not sure if i spelled it correctly) which also lower your cholesterol_ but not a statin drug like crestor or lipitor. I'm going to go back for another blood test in a week and see if my levels are down from where they were a month before I started taking it.,M,26,3  weeks145mg 1X D,7/15/2011,Tricor (micronized)

17, 1, High cholestrol,Shortly after starting_ began to have continuos_ extreme burning sensation on the bottom of both feet -- like a chemical burn.  Then after 30 days_ due to high stress_ my blood pressure (which had been normal) began to rise.At about three weeks_ I had a reoccurring_ cramp like pain in my left calf; then_ after being on Tricor for 30 days and stress at work got sever I began getting more spots of cramping in my left leg.  Then_ after two days of extreme stress -- which cause very_ high blood pressure_ I began having cramp-like pain all over my left leg_ left arm_ and right leg and each spot was painful from a few seconds to 20 minutes.  At first (when I had the single cramp-like pain in my left calf)_ my doctor suspected a possible blood clot but venal ultra sound was negative -- during that time my BP was normal.  Later_ when my BP was high due to stress I finally went to the E.R. and they ruled out everything except the Tricor.  I've stopped it for 2 days (now) and even though by BP,I would definitely NOT recommend TRICOR if you have or begin to have high blood pressure!  They are many of drugs I've been on for high cholesterol and this_ TRICOR_ is the first one that has given me these side-effects.  I'm so glad I found this website as it confirmed the E.R. doctor's findings.

18, 1, High triglycerides,I originally posted on here several years ago regarding my terrible experience with this drug. Since then_ the medical community has started to realize how devastating statin drugs can be to some people. In my case_ this drug permanently disabled my ability to walk any appreciable distance and it did this in a very short time period.  Unfortunately_ by the time my physician made the connection_ the damage had been done. My Achilles tendons became so degenerated that I had to have both of them resected and grafts put in. For those of you experiencing severe muscle aches and pain in your extremities_ I urge you to stop the medication IMMEDIATELY and see your physician and demand that he pay attention to your concerns.  Mine did not until it was too late.  The condition is known as statin myopathy.  Please take the time to research this if you are having problems as I describe. For those with no side effects_ you are fortunate. However_ in my case_ I was perfectly healthy and active and i,,F,62,4  months145 mg 1X D,4/21/2011Email,Tricor (micronized)

Before starting Tricor_ I walked on the treadmill for 60-90 mins 4-6 nights a week. I ate about 1200 cals a days_ mostly fruits_ veggies_ cherrios and fish. My overall cholesterol was 188_ bad cholesterol was 92_ good cholesterol was 44 and my Triglycerides were 319 - which is why I prescribed Tricor. I give you the background of my activity level because 3 weeks after starting Tricor and I have no energy_ My muscles feel weak and I just want to lay down. I have been this way for 3 days. Almost immediately after starting Tricor_ I have been craving fatty food. That is unusual for me.  But worst_ is the pressure I am feeling behind my eyes. I am going to talk with my doctor this week_ but I really think Tricor is the cause of me not feeling well. I am only 39 and very healthy - except the Triglycerides.

24, 1, hypertriglyceridemia,Let me start by saying that before I took the TriCor_ I was a very healthy and active individual_ able to do about anything physically I wanted with a demanding job in a physician's office.  After_ I felt I had aged 100 years. My symptoms began shortly after taking the medication with aching in the joints. This was tolerable and truthfully_ I thought it was just a sign of aging. However_ these mild symptoms rapidly progressed to an unbearable pain in my legs so severe I could not walk at all. Despite reporting these symptoms to my physician_ her answer was to run tests. All told_ several visits to the emergency room_ MRI_ Doppler_ CT scans_ numerous blood studies later_ the pain was more severe than ever.,On one of numberous trips to my physician_ the light went on for her. She said to stop the Tricor_ which I did immediately and though the pain stopped_ I was left with residual weakness in my lower extremities that is with me to this day. I am happy for those for whom the drug works. However_ on reading this board_ it appears that the bad far outweighs the good. I don't believe at all_ as one poster said_ that these symptoms are a natural aging process. When one becomes immediately disabled simply by taking a medication_ there is not one thing natural about that. It should be removed from the market_ or_ at the very least_ dispensed with caution and strong warnings about its harmful side effects.,F,62,4  months145 1X D,9/24/2010Email,Tricor (micronized)

As soon as I read this website_ that bottle went straight into the garbage can where it belongs.  By increasing exercise and making one MINOR change in my diet_ I cut that number in half in less than one month.

40, 2, High Triglycerides + 1100,I have been on all of the statins for years.  My last was tricor which I have been on and off for years.  I routinely get joint pains which the physicians could not explain.  I had suspected these drugs but was told that it probably was not the cause.  After reading this I believe I know better now.  I get joint swelling_ redness_ tenderness and severe pain which clears in about a week.  Very cyclic_ occurrs around every 7 to 9 months in one or the other ankle_ but never in both at the same time.  Feet always felt stuffed_ stiff and as if pads on the balls of my feet.,I had started on lopid when in was in my late 20's.  I had flu symptoms and eventually switch to Mevacor then Lipitor and Crestor.  A few years back I was switched to Triclor to try.  I have been experiencing joint pain in my ankles ever 6 to 9 months which resembled gout for years.  Redness_ swelling_ and severe pain when streching or moving the joint.  It would always affect only one ankle at a time  but this last week if finally hit my wrist.  I am going to have to get off of these medications because I can't tolerate these pains.  I have had multiple MRI on my ankle_ shoulder_ but the test showing nothing_ and the Orthpedic MD could not account for any findings causing the pain and swelling.  I had been working out 2 to 3 times a week until last year when I found I had 3 bulging discs.  I am now 53_ so I think I am going back to Niacin and Fish Oil.  I have had this unexplained joint pain for 15 years now_ and on occasion had a high cpk reading.  I suspected these medicaiton_ but now hearing everyone elses symptoms I am convienced. I periodically stop the med due to low back pain_ which feels inside and not as joint or muscle pain.

41, 3, 900+ Triglycereides,Only been on 145mg Tricor for a little over a week.  I have dreams that would make Stehpen Kings hair stand up.  My skin feels prickly/hot and my joint and muscle pain has amplified somewhat.  But what choice do I have?  Can not tolerate Niaspan (blistered my mouth).  I'm going to stick this out for a month and see what happens.  Dramatically_ altered my diet and quit alcohol.  Lost 10 lbs. my first week.  In the gym no matter how much it hurts.  Sometimes the cure can be worse than the problem.  I'll continue until my numbers come down.  More than likely I will only take a half tablet after first month.  I need to lose 30 more lbs.  Hopefully_ that will get me back to normal.  No pain_ no gain I guess.  Thanks to everyone for posting and raising my awareness!,Guess many of should just face some facts.  WE ARE GETTING OLD!  With that being said_ those of us in our forties and up have probably worked long and hard lives.  Many of the symtpoms described sound to me as the natural process of aging.  For those of you who have suffered severe organ damage_ I am really sorry to hear that.  I've been HIV+ for 24 years and don't really know what its like to be totally healthy.  Pain is just a part of my world...so I guess I can tolerate this med. better than others due to my conditioning to pain.  I feel really bad for the younger folks too.  What a lifetime battle you will have.  Get out and excerise and eat clean everyone.  Then get off the darn drugs!  I intend to.  I want to live.

And it appears the stuff has suddenly accelerated damage to my kidneys; I was a pretty well controlled diabetic_ now my life span may have been significantly shorted by these drugs. And the NEW evidence coming out on this drug (evidence not paid for by the drug companies) shows this drug has ZERO effect on rate of heart incidents! Most doctors these days are stupid self-serving pill pushers. Don't trust them.,IGNORE all the doctors who endlessly INSIST you HAVE to take this drug (and/or statins). They are just legally covering their @sses at the expense of YOUR health. The original published data (falsely concocted by the drug companies) SAY this stuff is effective and that the side effects are minimal. So the doctors HAVE to prescribe it or risk being sued for malpractice. When docs keep insisting you take this stuff_ they are choosing THEIR career at the expense of YOUR possible death. This stuff is pure poison and they know it. Don't you take it.,M,56,4  months,12/7/2009,Tricor (micronized)
43, 1, Trig,Until I came to this site I had no idea what was going on with my body! I've been having muscle pains in my lower back_ numbness and tingling in both arms_ all over muscles aches and pain_ swelling_ & weak feeling. And get this_ I began coughing alot (another side effect)...and so I went to the Dr. to find out if I was sick. So instead of going over my new Tricor prescription with me to see if it could be a side effect_ she prescribes an inhaler!! Which that in turn made my eyes puffy! Gooood Grief! Seems all my problems were from this drug. I had a pharmacist suggest Fish Oil_ Omega 3...so it sounds like that's the way to go. And of course diet!,I just read this article today...so going off the meds tonight & hopefully will feel better in 24 hours!!,F,47,2  months,11/23/2009,Tricor (micronized)
44, 1, high bad and good chlesteroel,I have been going to a family doctor for six weeks for feet leg stomach back chest and arm pain. Looking back I was in the emergancy room two times this year with chest pain they could not find a reason for. In decamber 08 I had shoulder surgery for what I was told was arthritis_ and I still have the same pains. The bottoms of my feet hurt so bad I cant walk at times_ my doctor has taking me off these two drugs and its been three weeks with no releaf. I have had MRIs cat scans bone scans and nothing else can be found. It is making it very dificult I am a active person cant take much more of this!!!!!,Any person thinking of using these two drugs better think hard_ the side effects are not worth it!!!!!!!,M,50,24  months,11/4/2009Email,Tricor (micronized)
45, 1, high triglycerides,Wow!  Side effects were severe and immediate.  Every muscle and every joint in my body experienced severe pain.  Could not sleep for two nights.  Side effects disappeared within 24 hours of stopping taking the drug.,I must be sensitive to this drug because the side effects were immediate: within 48 hours.,M,64,2  days,10/24/2009,Tricor (micronized)
46, 5, High Triglycerides,None.  Also taking Niaspin mega dose which causes hot flashes.,To those who are having problems_ I am sorry.  But please realize that those side effects are identified.  It simply means this wonderful drug may not be for you.  For those of without side effects_ it's a godsend.,M,47,1  years,10/15/2009,Tricor (micronized)
47, 1, Hi Triglycerides  875,My side effects started off as mild muscle pain/flu like symptons.  I've been taking Tricor 145mg for about 16 months now.  I have developed severe muscle pain_ mainly in my left shoulder blade area.  It is also in my upper arms and and outer thighs.  In each area is like a trigger point to the pain and this pain then spreads throughout the muscle.  I've had MRI_ x-rays_ and more and they showed nothing wrong.  I'm also fatigued_ sensitive to heat_ and I can't tell you when the last time I slept all night.  I would get awake at least every other hour throughout the night. My urine is getting darker in color the longer I take it.  Over the past couple of months I have been experiencing confusion.,"I finally decided to look up ""TRICOR and muscle pain"" on the internet and thank God for this website.  I have taken my last TRICOR pill as of today!!  This chronic back pain has got to stop.  I need sleep.  I would like to be able to go outside in the summer.",F,46,15  months,9/25/2009,Tricor (micronized)
48, 1, On doctor recommendation,Within 48 hours started having rectal disorder (constantly having to clean myself as if I soiled myself). After about a week_ I started having blood in my stools. I thought that maybe I was asjusting (NOT). After third week_ I quit taking it as I was bleeding to the point of weekness. The bleeding stopped after a couple days_ but I still have trouble with the other disorder. NEVER take this medication. There is nothing it does that is worth all this discomfort.,,M,44,3  weeks,9/21/2009,Tricor (micronized)
49, 1, High Triglycerides,Weakness_ depression_ confusion_ frozen muscles_ drawn up muscles_ inability to exercise due to total body stiffness.,This happened over the course of 2.5 years_ very slowly_ until I was almost unable to walk as my pelvis was pulled out of alignment by muscles that were affected.   After going to physical therapy for a couple of weeks I realized that maybe it was the drug and quit taking it.  It's been about 90 days since I quit and my body is almost back to normal.  I walk with no problems and my depression and confusion is gone.   Not a good drug for me at all when it comes to quality of life.,F,54,2.5  years,8/28/2009,Tricor (micronized)
50, 1, Trig are high,Both shoulders hurt could not sleep on either side.  Then mucsle pain in the right arm.  Confusion_ weakness_ fatigue and anger.  Six days into this hellish medicine I helped my daughter move I was so fatigue_ joints hurt_ couldn't sleep on either side.  Screaming at everyone.,I had a doctor give me medicine not tricor that gave me hot flashed and turned me red with itching.  Unbearable_ when this medicine didn't work he up the medicine (2x) which I was in the emegerncy room with_ no double.  I refuse to take it so he gave me 145 mg of this hell on earth tricor.  I am not going back to this doctor.  Thank you all for sharing you experiences with this medicine.  Not even the pharmacist could tell me about this medicine.  Sad! Very Sad!,F,54,23  days,8/26/2009Email,Tricor (micronized)
51, 2, High triglycerides,taking it about 2 months_ began to get hives on arms and stomach; experience numbness at night in my arms and hands_ so bad I can hardly sleep (I do take it at bedtime per dr's orders); some finger knuckles completely swollen overnight,I had no idea that these problems might be a result of Tricor until lying awake for 3 hours tonight with arm numbness and itchy hives_ and put two and two together. Glad to find this website and see that others have similar problems (sorry to share the pain!).  Am going to call the Doc in the morning and tell him I am stopping it.,M,39,60  days,8/4/2009,Tricor (micronized)
52, 1, Slightly high triglycerides,Severe sciatica to the point it was incapacitating at times.,Lowered triglycerides quickly_ but the severe sciatica pain was too high a price to pay.  Better treatment with diet and exercise.,F,75,1  years,7/31/2009,Tricor (micronized)

54, 1, High Trigylcerides,Took Tricor over 15 years.  When dosage was tripled_ I experienced  gradualsymptoms reaching excruciating pain in arms_ mainly right arm_ leg and rib cage; but basically throughout body. Tricor did bring down my trigylcerides but at a cost of what feels like I'm dying.,My biggest concern is that although I stopped taking Tricor over 6 months ago and am taking a pain reliever I continue to have severe side effects (pain) and cannot lift anything over 5 lbs because I become almost incapacitated for days. Would like to know if someone has recovered after these experiences.,F,68, ,7/24/2009Email,Tricor (micronized)
55, 1, High Triglicerides,Side effects manifested very slowly.  They were a general sense of fatigue_ an aversion to exercise and muscle pains.  They came on so slowly that I didn't realize it was the tricor until later.  The side effects went away_ also very slowly after ceasing to take the medication.  Controling Trigs with Fish Oil and CoQ10 now. Feel much better.,Also_ I was diagnosed with a cardiac myopathy after taking this med for two years.  I feel the two may be connected because the heart muscle (that was damaged) is the same as all the rest of the muscles in your body (which many are reporting to be damaged from this med).  PLEASE don't take this_ look for diet_ excercise and supplements instead of taking Tricor.,M,44,2  years,7/20/2009Email,Tricor (micronized)
56, 4, High Trigylcerides,I've been taking 145 mg for about 4 years.  Originally my trigs were 330 when put on the med.  Then after the first test_ they went down to 160.  I get a blood test done every 3-4 months.  For the last year_ with no diet changes or weight changes_ my trigs have slowly been creeping back up.  I'm thinking the medicine is no longer working for me_ but doctor says to keep taking.  I started taking an Omega-3 supplement and at the last check_ trigs were down 20 pts.  I think it was the Omega-3 and not the tricor that helped.  I'm going to talk to doctor again about quitting Tricor.  I had no bad side effects other than the flu-like symptoms at first.  I want to try exercise and good eating rather than taking this too.,,F,31,4  years,7/19/2009,Tricor (micronized)
57, 1, High Triglycerides,I have been taking Tricor 145 for about 18 months.  Over the past year or so I have been waking up each morning the a very stiff and sore back.  I asked my doctor about it and he does not think that the Tricor could be causing the problem.  He thinks that I am starting to have symptoms of arthritis.  Well the last week while on a trip for work_ I didn't plan right and ran out of Tricor_ and so I did not take it for 3 days while I will still on my trip.  I have not refilled the prescription yet and I have now been off it for 10 days.  I have noticed it that since not taking it every night that my back pain has stopped_ and some of the other muscle and joint pains that I have been having also have seemed to stop or lessen.  I will not go back to tricor.  I will try and lower my triglycerides with by diet and excerise.,,M,36,18  months,7/16/2009,Tricor (micronized)
