0, 5, RR Multiple Sclerosis,Flu like symptoms (chills_ sweating) at the beginning but they went away,Works great_ had a relapse after year one_ and one year 5 but considering that I began with numbness and a blind spot in my eye_ this works great_ everyone needs to find what works best for them but this has been great for me.,F,32,8  years1 1X W,12/11/2014,Avonex
1, 2, MS,As long as I drink plenty of water I experienced little side effects.  Headache and insomnia.  However_ it did not help my ms at all.  A year later I have three times the number of lesions.  My neuro is taking me off avonex due to my body not responding to it.  Didn't work for me.,,F,33,1  years30 mcg 1X W,9/11/2013Email,Avonex
2, 4, RRMS,"Flu like symptoms for a couple of injections. Serious depression_ anxiety_ achiness_ and ""the blues"" after about 6 to 8 months.",I loved the convenience of the medication. I had to get regular bloodwork. I didn't want to believe the blues was caused by the medication_ but I have been off of it for about 6 weeks now and I feel like a new person. No blues or depression_ greater energy level_ clearer thought process.,F,40,1  years30 MG 1X W,8/13/2012Email,Avonex

4, 2, Multiple Sclerosis,Pain down my spine_ severe chills_ flu like symptoms_ major depression_ nausea_ headaches_ muscle spasm_ joint pain.,The twitching and numbing came and went as if I was never on any medication. I just got diagnosed a few months ago_ so I really can't tell what's normal for me and what isn't. I don't feel it helped me at all with the twitching/numbness as these ocurred on/off all the time. It made me moody and I lost a few pounds_ which was probably the only positive thing out of this.,F,38,2  months30 mcg 1X W,10/23/2011,Avonex
5, 4, MS,In the beginning I was having flu like symptoms (chills/sweats_ headache_ achey muscles_ etc).  But after about 3 months these symptoms completely stopped and now I have no problems.  Sometimes I bruise at injection site_ just depends it seems pretty random.,I like avonex a lot_ I have been on it for 2 years and have only had one relapse and 1 small new lesion.  My husband gives me my weekly injection (I was doing it myself but all of a sudden developed anxiety about it and since he has taken over I have no anxiety about the actual injection). When I was having side effects I found it helpful to drink LOTS of water the day of injection and take alieve every six hours the day of and the day after.  I no longer take the alieve but I make sure to be really hydrated and it seems to work.,F,25,2  years 1X W,8/30/2010,Avonex
