0, 1, Dr thought meds fixed everything,Nightmares like you wouldn't believe! Poor sleep and profound depression.,First of all_ this is the best website for reading about medications bar none. That being said_ any negative reviews that you have read about this drug are so true it hurts. I wish I had stopped it after the second day because it led me down a path of virtual he'll you would never believe_ of course if you have taKen this med you know what I mean. Be careful_ this drug is very dangerous and if you find out the hard way it's most likely too late. Do whatever it takes to fix your problem besides taking meds..meds are not going to fix your problems one bit. Try to think of a med that cures anything...pretty much almost none. I can't believe this drug is still on the market since it says on the side effects that it can cause schizophrenia!!! And this drug actually got approved?!,M,41,2  weeks,7/7/2016Email,Sinequan
1, 1, Insomnia,This drug turned me into a zombie. I know everybody has their own threshold_ and I tried all the lower doses for insomnia like 3 mg_ 6 mg_ 10 mg. Sometimes 10 mg would work but I was always feeling hung over. I eventually settled on 20 mg and I basically slept my life away. I slept at night and I slept in the day  and I cried and I fought with people and I became another person. This drug did not work at all for me. I also have chronic headaches and the Mayo Clinic told me that this is a good chronic daily headache preventive. Did nothing for me. Not 1 ounce of help. Same for fibromyalgia. Zero. If you need a night's sleep here and there_ and you don't have to get anywhere with a crystal-clear mind_ this drug is fine. Otherwise_ forget it. I am so much happier off it.,,F,53,18  months20 1X D,4/13/2016,Sinequan

3, 4, Chronic Pain,Extreme tiredness!  Struggled to get up in morning and would fall asleep often on the couch early in the evening.  WEIGHT GAIN was crazy!  15kg in 5 months.  Managed to stabilise my weight with strict diet and exercise_ but couldn't shake more than 5kg.  Have just stopped a few days ago and am bright as a button (not at all tired!) and not craving food at all.  YAY!,So far_ so good!!!  Hopefully my pain doesn't return :),F,41,2  years10mg,11/27/2014Email,Sinequan
4, 2, Insomnia,Increase in appetite and 15 lbs weight gain in one month....This medication made me want to EAT all the time.,I had great hopes for this med_ because I have tried just about everything to help me sleep more than a few hours....But_ it did not help much for my insomnia_ and increased my appetite_ followed by the weight gain......If you are weight conscious_ you should probably avoid this medication.,F,51,4  weeks25-100mg 1X D,4/29/2014,Sinequan
5, 3, Parasethesia & associated insomnia,EXTREME sleepiness!!  Can't get out of bed.  I take other meds_ so this is probably the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.  Will give it two more days_ and if my body doesn't get used to it_ I'm done!,,F,50,3  days25 mg 1x d,2/13/2014Email,Sinequan

7, 4, Panic attacks,At first I had extreme drowsiness and blurred vision. But it saved my life 5 time over. The first time for panic attacks. Then later on in life I had radiation to my chest and random nerve pain. Then I had a crushed LisFranc fracture and nerve pain and again_ small doses did the trick.,Us low dose and give it time. When I restart it _ its like I never left off. Works right away.I do not have to wait weeks for it to kick back in.,F,58,20  years25mg 2X D,10/30/2013Email,Sinequan
8, 4, severe hives,hair loss and mood swings.  Some weight gain despite exercising daily and paying attention to what I eat.  Only drug besides prednisone that has eliminated the hives.  Thankful_ but now wish the hair loss will stop.  Seeing a dermatologist next week.,,F,55,4  months40 2X D,7/30/2013,Sinequan
9, 5, Insomnia causing anxiety and depres,Some dry mouth_ but tolerable. Chew gum. Some weight gain_ about 25 pounds in one year but I ate like a pig_ Now eating less and it's coming off.,I tried every drug out there for horrible insomnia over a six year period. It just got worse.. The insomnia turned into depression_ then horrible anxiety and panic. Folks_ this drug is a Godsend. I take 25mg of Seroquel (the generic) and 150mg of Doxepin at night. For 7 years now_ I have slept 8hrs a night_ and have zero anxiety. Please give these medications a chance_ MUCH better than addicting benzodiazapines like Xanax and Klonopin_ etc! and yes_ Lunesta and Ambien are benzo derivatives! The doctors hand them out like candy_ they are a dead end road. Stay away from them.,M,57,7  years150 mg 1X D,6/24/2013Email,Sinequan
10, 3, mood/anxiety/sleep,I had to come off seroquel because it was making me so tired all day. This drug makes me tired at night_ but doesn't knock me out like seroquel. It also doesn't make me tired all day like seroquel. I'm probably used to extreme sedation so I'm sure that plays into why it doesn't knock me out like others. EXTREME appetite increase. I can't stop eating. I've been on it a few days_ I can't go 10 minutes without putting food in my mouth. Scared I'll gain weight.,Only time will tell if it works for my moods/anxiety. Coming off seroquel_ so I'm not experience any anger or anxiety so it very well may be working since I'm not experiencing mood problems from coming off of the other anxiety/mood stabilizer.,F,25,5  days60 1X D,1/7/2013Email,Sinequan
11, 2, to get to sleep and stay asleep 9hr,"Didn't experience bad dreams as have so many others writing here_ but i slept forever on this drug_ though i still need additional drugs like zopiclone (Canadian ""lunestsa""_ i.e._ imovane or benadryl to put me to sleep. i always slept over 12 hours on it_ i just couldn't get up_ and then when i finally did i felt depressed and groggy still for several hours_ incapable of doing anything.",I have in desperation to find a good sleep med taken this drug off and on. i notice that it is seriously impairing my memory_ e.g_ i can never even remember the day of the week. so i go off. then weeks later i try it again. same story. i also take xanax but though it relaxes me during the day it doesn't seems to put me to sleep at night_ and it wears off after about 5 hrs. so i wake and take some more.,M,65, 12 1X D,10/29/2012Email,Sinequan
12, 5, For sleep and depression,Does make me a great deal more hungry- scary huge appetite. It does get me to sleep- I use it as needed which was several months ago for 2 Sunday evenings and the night before last due to the insomnia from increasing Lamictal from 25 to 50 mg. it is very sedating and it can be very hard to wake up the next morning. I have to have plenty of coffee on hand and I feel hungover and could sleep the day away the next day. It will get the job done in treating insomnia though and if you aren't sleeping if you are like me you grin and bear it through the side effects to get that precious sleep. There may be weight gain- but nothing like I hear you can get from Seroquel.,,F,39,3  years25MG,6/13/2012,Sinequan
13, 2, Insomnia_ Adjunct Antidepressant,Extreme (Remeron level) sedation the next day lasting all the way into late afternoon the next.  Second evening_ took it again_ and BAM was back in insomnia-ville.  Brain fog severe.  Hangover effect.  Rapid reduction in efficacy when taken for more than 3 consecutive nights (tolerance forms_ luckily not dependence).Unsure if related to Doxepin_ but severe rash appeared the morning after I took my first ever dose.  See details re rash in add'l comments.,"For me_ the rapid reduction in efficacy for insomnia happens with all TCAs_ Trazadone_ Remeron_ and other old-gen anti-depressants.  Had hoped Doxepin would be different_ but of course_ my luck_ it's not.Doxepin s/e - nausea_ vomiting_ severe random vertigo_ GI issues_ diarrhea_ sedation_ daytime fatigue_ hangover effect (POSSIBLE_ not positively related: severe rash described below).Was prescribed 25mg dosage_ but after 3 nights got my pill cutter out and split the capsule (it's filled with very fine white powder)_ grabbed the most ""upright"" half of the cap_ then just took that part and discarded the rest.  Less hangover effect (at a ~10-12.5mg dose)_ less brain fog_ less fatigue_ fewer headaches.  Also no nausea_ vomiting_ or vertigo.Buuut....my doctor told me to stop due to my severe rash.  It looked like inflammation + insect bites + swaths of severe sunburn + water blistering; at night my feet would become bluish and bruised.",F,28,8  days25mg 1X D,11/15/2011Email,Sinequan

However_ once I am up it takes me much less time to become functional than it used to.,Since I am already on another tricyclic antidepressant (altho. there are significant differences between the various tricyclics)_ i.e._ clomipramine_ I'm in no hurry to up the dosage. The reason I take sinequan is to help me sleep_ which it does. I was off it for several weeks and when I started up again I expected to be more zonked the next day than I was_ but it was as if my body remembered and continued where I left off_ i.e._ not so much a zombie the next day./Really_ just getting out of bed is the hardest part.
