No new lesions_ no active lesions after 6 month MRI checkup_ and I am JC Virus Negative. I was extremely afraid of JCV_ but after my first clear MRI in years_ I couldn't be happier right now!,F,46,6  months 1X M,6/3/2016Email,Tysabri
1, 4, MS,Mild headache after first two infusions.  Lethargic a couple of days before and a day after infusion.  Very easily tolerated.,Staying well hydrated has combated the lethargy_ also makes it easier to find a vein.  Dx 2014_ started with Tecfidera (nearly cleared psoriasis_ but no help to MS)_ switched to Tysabri and had my first stable MRI after six months of treatment.  No new lesions_ no enhancing lesions_ one lesion increased in size.  Very happy with outcome.  I am JCV+ but with an exceptionally low titre_ I am not worried about PML at this time.,F,34,7  monthsInfusion 1X M,5/6/2016Email,Tysabri
