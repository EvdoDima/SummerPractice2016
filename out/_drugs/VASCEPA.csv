1, 2, High Cholesterol and Triglycerides,Joints in my hands now ache all the time. I just couldn't figure it out_ why so bad. Finally dawned on me I have been taking Vascepa. It does make my fingernails strong and grow like crazy.,Didn't lower my cholesterol_ but Dr. Said it was keeping Triglycerides down_ so kept me on it. Took Lipitor for 10 years and had to go off due to side effects of leg swelling. Leg muscle pain and brain fog.
