0, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Suffered with chronic sinus infections which I attributed to humira_ other than that nothing to really speak of,It has worked wonders in both the joint pain issues and skin issues. Would recommend it to anyone suffering with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. It is very costly and you will definitely have to have insurance to afford it.,M,54,10  years40g 2X M,8/6/2016Email,Humira
1, 4, PsA,None so far,Noticed immediate improvement in joint pain and the numbness from the carpal tunnel caused by the PsA. Expected the injection (pen) to be painful based upon the doctor saying it's the most painful of the injections but felt nothing with my first two injections. Happy so far.,F,57,2  weeks40 mg 2X M,7/26/2016,Humira

6, 1, Psoriatic Arthritis,Breathless_persistent cough_extreme fatigue_allergic reaction to Humira,Worked very quickly to clear psoriasis and stop pain in joints with no problems until recently after a chest infection. Didn't take when ill and after 2 courses of antibiotics thought it had cleared so did next injection. Next day I was covered in hives and coughing uncontrollably. Face swelled. Went Dr and sent for chest X-Ray told stop injection until results back. I have no energy at all.

7, 2, Reactive Arthritis and UC,Severe fatigue_ depression_ anxiety_ impaired memory and cognitive ability_ increase in already terrible hand and wrist pain_ headaches_ widespread itching_ general feeling of being unwell.,My rheumatologist had told me Humira had helped his other patients so much_ and I was desperate for relief_ so I tried it. Sadly_ I have felt much worse since beginning treatment. My husband told me he definitely notices the negative changes_ and he is very concerned because I am always exhausted and in pain far more than I was prior to taking Humira. I am happy for those Humira helps_ and I had wished I could be one of them_ but that is not the case. I hope someone will discover another option for people like me. One that is safer_ has less side effects_ and will provide permanent relief.,F,44,5  weeks40 2X M,7/11/2016Email,Humira
8, 1, Psoriatic Arthritis,Caused my arthritis to worsen (it now affects all my joints. Before it was only my knees and occasionally ankles). Severe muscle weakness and pain (so much so that it is a struggle to take my own shirt off_ for example). Esophageal spasms that make it difficult to eat and are quite painful. Pustular psoriasis. I had never had any of these problems before humira_ and I truly believe humira caused them.,Wouldn't chance taking this drug. Wish I'd known the horrors it would could cause beforehand because I never would've taken it. I am now way worse than I ever was.,F,30,4  months40 mg,7/7/2016Email,Humira
9, 5, Crohns disease,Initial injection site pain and redness. Fatigue.,I take one shot a week. It's put my Crohns in remission. I do have increased fatigue_ but it's a small price to pay for not having active Crohns.The injection is VERY painful.,F,33,4  years.8 mL,7/6/2016,Humira
10, 4, Psoriasis,Diagnosed with fungal (thrust/yeast) infection in my throat and mouth. Now a cough. Going to go on a candida friendly diet and limit sugar as this feeds yeast.

11, 3, Severe chronic ulcerative colitis/,I would get the occasional headache and get very itchy at injection site. Now I have sores in my mouth and the sides of my mouth are cracked and won't heal.. 7 months already.. Reg Dr said it was a fungus. I have a clear discharge from my nipples thought I had cancer went through a crap load of tests was told it was nothing. A year later still happening..  severe leg cramps to where it wakes me up at night_ to the point of me crying.. Brain fog_ moodiness_ crabby_now I have hives and I'm itchy from head to toe. Thought I was allergic to my soap and deodorant..  hair loss. Weight gain.always tired. Nose bleeds at least once a week.. sores in my nose.. constantly feeling like I have phlem in back of throat..  difficulty swallowing ( feels like I'm trying to swallow a golf ball) severe dry eyes..  Addressed some of these symptoms to my GI Dr before and my regular Dr. And not once did they say it could be the Humira.,I was on Remicade for about 6 years after I had my first bout with Pyroderma Gangrenosum which is caused by the Ulcerative colitis.  They took me off of that due to they were afraid that it would stop working. They put me on Humira.  Wasn't having too many issues at first. Now it seems I have the whole damn list of problems.

12, 5, RA,I really never experienced any side effects other than fatigue_ which is expected with RA.,I have been on Humira 40 mg. for about 6 years. This is a Wonder Drug!  I don't have any joint pain like I did when I was first diagnosed. I realize some people have developed certain cancers_ but no one knows if it was already occurring before they took Humira.

15, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Just a liitle fatigue the day after injection,"Mercaptupoline (6 MP) almost killed me.  Put me in the hospital with a red blood cell count of 4.3 (normal about 17) making numerous transpusions necessary.  I was almost out of options for a very stubborn case of U.C. when my Doctor prescribed Humira.  What a miracle!  I have been taking Humira bi-weekly for a little over two years and my symptoms improved dramatically!  In fact_ after my most recent colonoscopy_ I wsa declared in remission.  My quality of life is back to where it was before my diagnoses!  I know there are certain risks and sideffects to every drug_ but I had very few options left other than the dreaded ""S"" word (Surgery!!)  Thank you Doctor_ and Thank you Humira for giving me my life back!",M,55, 40 1X O,5/26/2016,Humira
16, 5, Ankylosis Spondylitis_ Crohns,Very happy. Weakness for first 3 months then no side effects.,Best results for Spondylitis. Not so much for Crohns. Had 3 hospital stays for Crohns.,M,66,10  years40 mg,5/25/2016,Humira
17, 3, Ulcerative Colitis and Spondylitis,Small red bald spot in my hair. My hair just slid out my hair about 2 weeks ago and no new growth has started. Also I have Weird disturbing dreams the first few nights after the shot.,I don't know how much the Humira is helping. I still have blood in my stool every bm. If I eat normal portions of food or most foods no matter how little I get pain in the side. At the moment I am only eating jar fruit ( the kind in the fruit juice ) and eggs. I can't seem to tolerate any form of starch ie bananas_ raw veggies_ most veggies even if cooked_ dairy is a big no_ white sugar_ heavy fats_ tap and some spring water (distilled_ reverse Osmosis and other flat waters seem fine). I can handle bone broth and veggies juice from my juicer that does a good job removing fiber. But I don't have time to juice. I see my G.I. tomorrow to discuss this. I don't have diarrhea so perhaps the Humira has fixed that. I don't have a lot of blood in stool like before so perhaps it is helping. I think it is. I wish I could eat more food and I wish I didn't have this bald spot in my scalp. I don't think it helps with my AS or Uveitis at all so far. I will up date this (Lord willing) next month. I started Humira February 25_ 2016 and today is May 25_ 2016. I do not take any other medication.,F,41,3  months,5/25/2016Email,Humira

Was put on Remicade which was terrific but would not last a full 4 weeks due to my antibodies attacking the medication.

23, 5, Psoriasis,Hard to tell if I really experienced any side effects. One thing I noticed is that I had to start taking allergy pills and high blood pressure medicine shortly after I started the Humira. But_ none of them can be directly related to the usage of Humira.,Humira is actually my second stint of a 99% cured psoriasis. I used Enbrel for 2 years until the insurance denied it. Then I was put on Humira and up until recently was 99% free. Now I have about 50 spots of red all over (100% sure it's psoraisis. I am going to contact my dermatologist.

However this is a small price to pay.,Lefludamide_ HCQ and Arcoxia failed to stop my knee froming going bad and was requiring injections every few months to walk again. Been in Humira now for 10 months and have not had a single episode. Back  exercising without worry_ playing golf and long walks. Still get the odd day of pain but no inflamation.Still on the other 3 but hoping to come of at least one of them next time I see my consultant.The itches and rashes are annoying but they are only mild and I haven't had an injection in nearly year now.

36, 4, Crohns + Fistulising  Crohns,Sometimes I have no side effects. Other times I get sore joints (mainly in my arms + hands). Tiredness and lethargy.Small amounts of memory loss (my wife reckons thats a man thing),Humira works_ but you have to give it time. If your looking for a quick fix it_ this is not for you.I got put on humira after having a total colectomy and development of fistulising crohns. It took 1.5 years to work properly and a lot of experimentation with pain meds_ antibiotics and sleep meds but i'm now on a mix of drugs that allows 90% normal life. Before humira i was a mess.I started exercising 4-5 times a week about 8 months ago and found that exercise reduces side effects dramatically. I still get the odd bad days sometimes but they are few and far between now.I have used both the syringe and auto injector. The syringe works for me as I can control the flow of the injection. Auto injector i would not recommend from the mental anticipation aspect.9 years ago_ crohns nearly killed me.

40, 4, Ankylosing Spondylitis,I've experienced multiple colds that have led to worse like bronchitis & pneumonia but I also have hypothyroidism & asthma so my immune system is already extremely inefficient.,I was experiencing extreme pain in my feet_ hands_ lower back_ shoulders_ wrists_ ankles_ Achilles' tendons_ & elbows. It started in 7th grade & continued to get worse. I have done cross country for 4 years & had to quit because of the pain. I also played soccer & stayed with that because I love sports. my freshman year was pretty mad when it came to pain. I started experiencing tingling in my legs & the pain started to become unbearable. this made me extremely depressed which didn't help with just starting high school. being very able to deal with pain this started to scare me because I couldn't. I went through many MRIs_ X-rays & blood work. they found nothing & pretty much looked at me like I was making it up. At the beginning of my soccer season of my sophomore year it stayed extremely painful getting worse & worse. it was very hard to participate & that angered my coaches. I was benched many times because of missing practices or having to sit out of things. finally one of my moms coworkers referred my to a rheumatologist about 45 mins away from my house who was a friend of his. being 16 he was slightly hesitant taking me because of his practice being for adults. luckily his friend told him nobody was helping & he finally took me in. he actually listened to what I had to say & didn't believe I was lying. he requested new blood work which still came back normal. because of my inflammation & pain_ he started me on prednisone w,F,17,8  months40 mg,2/24/2016Email,Humira
41, 5, Ankylosing Spondylitis,Frequent colds and bugs _especially a day or two after injection.,"This drug has saved my life. I was in horrible chronic pain and had flares that would move around in my neck_upper_mid_lower back_ ribs_ si joints_ and groin area. I was untreated and Mis diagnosed for years including by a rheumatologist because my blood work came up clean. after seeing doctor after Doctor_ having Mri And X-rays of every part that would flare only to have it show nothing. I had no idea what was going on and it was embarrassing to show up at the doctor a few weeks later saying ""now it hurts here"". My first rheumatologist  was clueless as to my diagnosis and refused to even try the humira because of no proof of inflammation from the labs. The  only med that would ever help was prednisone and we all know that can only be taken short term. After taking every nsaid_ muscle relaxer_ and opiod in the book_ after painful and hopeless months of physical therapy and a tens unit_ after pain management treated me like a drug seeking teenager and told me ""pain was subjective"" I had given up hope and contemplated suicide to escape the pain (3 years untreated)( I love my life but the pain was unbearable)My sister recommended her rheumatologist so in my last ditch effort I went to see him. I poured my heart out_ I cried_ I told him my story.  That rheumarheumatologist diagnosed me with Ankylosing Spondylitis after my testimonial. He didn't rely on bloodwork for his diagnosis. His decision saved my life. Humira has saved my life.",M,30,9  years40mg,2/10/2016Email,Humira

It has been a life savor.,I had plaque psoriasis covering over 90% of my head_ face and body. Started on Humira almost 6 years ago.  started seeing the positive results within a month_ and completely clear within 4 months.  Prior to Humira_ I was already on BP & diabetic medications. After 6 years on Humira_ I am still in remission_ and fortunately no side effects.  The side effects reported are very scary_ but as long as you do not experience any significant side effects_ I would say Humira is a WONDER drug.  Although it's very expensive (about $3600 for 1 month supply)_ the copay assistance is a huge help.  After copay assistance and insurance payment_ I end up paying only about $10/month.

Suppressing your immune system combined with dangerous staph infections_ and antibiotic resistance is VERY scary as these infections can become very serious.  It does help my crohn's disease. For the first year_ I felt great.  No issues with the injections. They are a teeny bit painful_ but not at all unbearable.  After my 4th staph infection_ that progressed A LOT more quickly than the rest_ I am starting the leg work to discontinue this medication and try to control my crohns naturally with diet_ supplements_ rest_ and monitoring my bloodwork.,F,30,3  years40mg 1X D,1/20/2016Email,Humira

49, 4, Crohns,Red_ swollen injection site (size of a golf ball)_ migraine headache within 24 hours of injection then it goes away within a day after taking migraine medication and with sleeping (not good when you have a job and kids)_ dizziness/vision issues within a day and then go away_ general fatigue and weight gain,I started Humira after stopping Cimzia after 2 years because of a bad fungal infection.  I switched doctors too because I felt my GI wasn't proactive and experienced with IBD.  After taking a break for a few months_ my new doctor prescribed Humira and it's worked well for me_ keeping a fistula at bay and also no bowel issues other than gas.  That's a huge improvement. No doubt better than anything I've ever taken.  I did end up getting resection surgery last year for a stricture but that was a long time coming.  Years of damage prior to effective medications we have today.  So after 3 years the side effects of Humira are worrisome and have gotten worse over time.  The migraine headache for instance is dreadful. I dread taking my medication. They didn't start until I was on the drug over a year so it concerns my doctor that it didn't happen right away like a side effect should.   I think you can develop worsening side effects over time with biologics.  Either way_ it's never simple.  Always reminded of the risks vs benefits.  My observation is that even the best doctors are overwhelmed with so many patients.  It's worrisome that complications from biologics can be life threatening.  I have young children so I am busy and I tend to minimize my side effects which isn't ideal when taking a strong medication like Humira.  I don't feel like I have any other options because of the severity of my IBD.,F,45,3  years40 mg 2X M,1/16/2016,Humira

Just my wallet :),After years in and out of the hospital from age 13-26 I finally tried Humira after using Prednisone_ 6MP_ and Remicade injections - none of which worked except Humira. It is wildly expensive_ but it is the only thing that makes me feel 100%. It's like I don't even have Crohn's anymore - truly incredible. I am scared of future complications but it is worth it to have a life and enjoy living without the terrible symptoms of Crohns. Put me in remission for 21 months of the 21 months on it so far...,F,27,21  months2 Pens 1X O,1/5/2016,Humira
