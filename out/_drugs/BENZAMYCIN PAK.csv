0, 5, Acne,dry skin,Besides proactiv solution_ this is the only cream that has ever helped my severe acne. Plus it kinda firmed up my skin and didn't make it look so saggy. The only problem was I was getting lines under my eyes and it was cracking and aging my skin a little.,F,17,3  years,2/6/2007Email,Benzamycin pak
1, 5, persistent but mild acne,definitely is very harsh on skin.  must counter drying with a heavy duty moisturizer.  otherwise_ no complaints.,I must've started using bezamycin about a year ago and it was what FINALLY cleared much of my skin up.  I have mild acne (not nodular -- mostly small lumps_ blackheads_ pore clogs) and it really did work for me.  I just recently went off it to try differin as it wasn't eliminating these small under the skin lumps around my mouth...big mistake!  Differin made my skin look as it did years ago and so I went back to benzamycin.  ALready I've seen a drastic improvemnt!  Thank god for this stuff!,F,19,1  years,8/2/2006,Benzamycin pak
