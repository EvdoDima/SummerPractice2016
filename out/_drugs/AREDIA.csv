I feel tired_ a little nauseated_ pain in creases when I sit down or stand up_ I am getting spasms in my hands and feet_ and have a slight headache at times.,I told my doctor about my problems after the first infusion and he said it was unusual to have any side effects and it was probably due to something else.

The second year it stayed the same_ and then this years bone density results were down alot.  Therefore my doctor's suggested that I take another 6 weeks of treatment.  I go once a week for a 4 1/2 hour infusion (30mg of Aredia with 500 mg of saline).  I have 4 treatments done and just 2 left.  I guess I'll see if it works this time_ but I worry about the effects if will have on me in years to come.,F,29,4  weeks,11/28/2006Email,Aredia

12, 5, Metastatic Breast Cancer,I can't say that I have had any side effects with Aredia because I have been taking either chemo or other meds during the same time as the Aredia which makes it almost impossible to differentiate between what causes side effects. I started taking Aredia in 2003 when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer with bone and bone marrow metastisis. I had fractures in my back & ribs before my diagnosis and after I started on the Aredia the pain in my bones all but disappeared.  I still have some stiffness after sitting a while and getting up to walk_ and occassionally get a little achy_ but otherwise it has been wonderful.  Without a doubt I would have been and still would be in a lot of pain if not for the Aredia.  I am blessed to still be alive and blessed to be able to lead a quality life without being in constant pain.,,F,60,2  years,2/23/2006,Aredia
13, 3, multiple myeloma,"My doctor is taking me off Aredia for a couple of months to see if my joint stiffnes_ pain_ and imobility might be a result of taking the drug.

Am to see a rheumotoligist in a couple of weeks but have already been tested for rhemotoid arthritis (negative).",I have been on the drug 4 months prior to BMT and 9 months now while I am in remission.

14, 4, Ostheoporosis,I have been taking Aredia for almost 2 years now.  Every 3 months_ for about 4 hours drip_ 60 mg with 500 ml saline - I go the clinic for the injection.No side effects so far - My last bone density showed that my spine improved a lot_ no more ostheo.  My hips also improved_ no more in the danger stage of breaking_ but I still need a little bit of improvement.I will have to continue the treatment for another year_ and hopefully_ after another bone density_ I will stop the treatment.I have also to mention that I take everyday_ 600 gr of calcium and 1000 units of Vitamin D_ and I exercie every day at the YMCA for 1 to 2 hours.,I would like to know in the long run_ is there any side effects that could be dangerous to my health ?,F,65,2  years,1/16/2005Email,Aredia
15, 1, It was to help my bone density,I had a Blood Stem Cell Transplant about 6 months after being diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma.  About a year after I had the transplant and was in remission_ I still am_ after 7 years_ I was given this drug. I read all the side effects I could find on it_ and it seemed fairly safe. All the time I was getting it once a month_ and about 5 years_ I find the Aredia is the cause of all my dental problems.  All my teeth have fallen out in the lower part of my mouth. If you look in my mouth_ you can see the jaw bone is completely exposed.  The dentis says there is no treatment for this_ just antibiotics and pain pills. Surgery will not work_ nor will the hyperbaric chamber. I can't even wear dentures on the bottom_ as there isn't enough of the jawbone left for the dentures to,,F,60,5  years,6/2/2004Email,Aredia
