3, 3, elevated IOP,feeling that chest is heavy_ post nasal drip_ sore throat; it hurts when i sneeze or cough sometimes_ body malaise_ anxiety attacks.I never attributed the anxiety attacks to the meds but to the possibility of developing glaucoma.It is too soon to cast the verdict as I am only on 1 week on Xalatan.,i was put on Xalatan after 5 days of having alphagan_ azopt_ and pilocarpine. IOP of both eyes lowered to 18 and when i came back after 6 days on xalatan alone_ right eye was on 24.  doctor had to combine xalatan with azopt and will be back after a week again.

8, 4, High IOP,When generics came out a few years ago I was given Falcon brand by Alcon instead of Xalatan. It lowered pressure fine but it took me 8 months to figure out it that it was the generic drops and not some other supplement or other factors that was causing a feeling of pressure under my heart and palpitations that would go away when I stopped the drops for a few days and come back when I started them again. When I switched to the Pfizer Greenstone generic latanoprost made in the same facility in Belgium and in the same bottles as Xalatan with the same exact label ingredient list_ the problem went away. Unfortunately_ sometime in the last year_ the Greenstone brand has become ineffective. I see it is now made in Ireland instead of Belgium. I wonder if there's a difference that is making it ineffective or if it's just something that might happen anyway after 10 years.,I've had to try different additional drops and may have to take Alphagan P  0.1% 3 times a day in addition to latanoprost since the Greenstone generic has become ineffective. I would like to try a different generic latanoprost or even the brand-name Xalatan to see if it would work again_ but I would have to stop the new drops for a week or so to test it. The situation with the generic latanoprost having different side effects and/or being ineffective is unfortunate. My pharmacy now uses Acorn brand made in India_ which I haven't tried yet. The first generic I mentioned_ Falcon_ made by Alcon_ which gave me side effects I didn't have with Xalatan_ at the time was made in United States (Texas) I was told by the manufacturer_ but when I asked where the ingredients were made they said it was proprietary information and wouldn't tell me_ so you can deduce what that means.,M,66,11  years1 drop 1X D,1/3/2015,Xalatan

11, 1, Glaucoma Suspect High IOP,Anxiety_ Muscle Aches and Bronchitis using Latanoprost (generic Xalatan),Took Metipranolol for 12 yrs and new doc wanted me on new drug as  Metipranlol is Beta blocker. He thought I had Bronchial issue. Tried to take Latonoprost twice and stopped both times due to anxiety/panic attacks that took 2 weeks to go away after stopping the drug. I can take the muscle aches but the anxiety is totally unacceptable. I am back on a beta blocker Timolol. For me Latanoprost is not for me no way.

Did not have this effect with brand-name Xalatan I used years ago.,I switched from Travatan ($42) to generic Xalatan ($8) for cost reasons. Within four months my eye pressures had risen from my usual 17-18 to an unacceptable 25. Back to Travatan. This result may not be typical_ but users of generic Xalatan should be aware it is possible. Several companies offer generic latanoprost_ and perhaps a different maker would be better_ but my pressure control is too precarious to experiment.,F,70,4  months1 drop 1X D,5/6/2012,Xalatan

19, 3, eye pressure,After six months I began experiencing shoulder pain and muscle soreness. I'd put drops in at 11 pm. At 2am I'd wake up with pain shooting down my neck and shoulder. I would get up and take an aspirin. I'd also use a vibrating tool. It would take me two hours before I could go to sleep. I went to my doctor after two weeks to check for signs of a heart attack. He checked me out and said it must be something else. A week later I started with a chiropractor to alleviate the pain. It helped some. I had to open a new bottle of Xalatan. I read the literature. I saw that 2% patients experienced muscle pain and joint pain. I called my opthamologist to tell him. We agreed for me to stop taking the drug for two weeks. Last night I slept through the night again for the fifth straight night after I stopped taking Xalatan.

I think he has a listening problem. As soon as I stop taking the med things begin to clear up. He says I have no other option. Thinking of quitting both the Xalatan and going to this doc. The drug itself worked on lowering my pressure to 15. My eye pressure to start was 25 and 20.,Most people seem to do ok with this drop. My dr says other drops have even more side effects.
