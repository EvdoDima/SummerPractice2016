1, 1, Meniere's Disease,Increase Dizziness_ Tingling hands feet_ skin felt crawly_ nausea_ brain fog_ easily confused_ tired_ tired_ tired,"In my case I do not recommend taking this for Meniere's Disease. It made all the symptoms worse!! And it's been 3 months since I stopped taking it and the side effects are still happening. It's taken a problem and tripled it.  It has really made my life unbearable. I was an active motivated_ clear minded person and now I'm just lost in this fog of confusions and feel stupid and useless. It has destroyed what was left of my life and self esteem and am just praying that the side effects will go away. No one told me that this could happen and no one seems to care enough to listen ~ I am not imagining this and I know what happened and when things got so bad... be very careful with this medication ~ it may work for some people_ but for the rest of us it has destroyed our lives... Thank you to everyone for their reviews_ I've been lost and don't wish it on anyone_ but it's good to know that I'm not ""just imagining it.""",F,52,6  days 2X D,4/6/2016Email,Diamox

3, 4, IIH,Some dizziness. Subsided after first month. Ringing in hands_ legs_ and feet. Feet tingling still awakes me at night. Exhausted most of the time. And always feel cold. Dry hair and mouth. Soda has tasted metallic since day dosage started; however after a month all food began to taste like cardboard. Loss of breath with little exertion_ almost feels like hyperventilation. Fogginess of thought is frustrating. Despite seldom having a meal_ have not lost much weight on this medicine.,This drug_ along with effective lumbar puncture_ has saved my vision_ which was in great danger with CSF pressure of 570. The side effects are bothersome_ but seem minimal when alternative is considered. When I miss a dose_ it's noticeable. My eye aches_ ear whooshing begins again_ and headache starts to sneak in. So it is working.,F,41,2  months2000,12/31/2015,Diamox
4, 4, IIH,I am still on this drug but I hate it_ I am constantly tired and get extremely slow and confused where I feel thick and ditsy and that is not me. I have had severe joint pain which seems to be getting worse from day 1 and my neurologist has brushed it off and believes that it is nothing to do with Diamox_ I've been referred to several joint consultants and none of them can tell me why I'm getting these pains. I feel as if my body is weak and I also tend to get a tight head and random blurry vision which can last for 20 minutes then go back to normal. My libido has also gone completely.,,F,23,2  years2000MG,12/29/2015Email,Diamox

7, 5, Chiari 1,Tingling in hands/feet. I am cold all the time. The initial side effects of taste issues went away. I have joint pain- knees especially and I have no grip in  my hands at times. I do struggle with fatigue off and on. Foggy brain and inability to focus at times.  I am now wondering if this med is what is killing my libido??,It is a relief to find this page. I felt like I was going crazy at times. I am not that old yet I can't remember things and my quick wit seems to be going rapidly:( I thought I had an undetected autoimmune issue but after reading all these posts- I think the joint issues are b/c of this med. I am now experiencing decreased libido for the last year or so and am wondering if this med is why. I did go off of it for 5 days and ended up with an rare form of migraine that mimics a seizure and was hospitalized. Clearly the side effects are worth it. That was very scary!,F,35,4  years250 1X D,7/31/2015Email,Diamox
8, 4, PTC,Tingling and numbness in hands_ feet_ lower legs_ and lower half of face. Some indigestion and heartburn at the beginning and when dose was increased.,The drug is saving my sight. When the PTC kicked in with the headaches_ vertigo_ horrible tinnitus_ dizziness_ vomiting_ nausea_ I wasn't paying much attention to my sight at first. When I did...I was shocked at how blurry and difficult it was to focus. I was diagnosed with secondary glaucoma do to the pressure_ and had already lost some vision. The Diamox was increased_ and eye drops added to the long list of medications and no further damage to my sight has occurred. As much as I dislike the tingling_ the numbness_ and it increases whenever the dose is increased_ I won't go off until the PTC is resolved. That unfortunately hasn't shown any sign of happening.,F,47,3  years500 2X D,7/16/2015Email,Diamox

11, 4, Puedotumor Cerebri/IIH,Tingling in fingers and toes_ fatigue_dry mouth_ loss of appetite. frequent urination. diarrhea_ cramping_ joint pain,I was diagnosed with Psuedotumor 2months ago. About a month before I was having severe headaches that had me screaming and in tears. I had to stay in complete darkness and everyone had to speak in a whisper because light and sound triggered the headache. I thought I had a brain tumor or an aneurysm. Drs. said it was just migraines and that they were normal for a woman in her first trimester. A couple weeks later I was back in the hospital because my double vision had greatly increased and my right eye stopped moving. A new Dr. finally diagnosed me with pseudotumor and started me on Diamox. It is true that the side effects can be horrible. I started out taking 1_000mg and was increased to 2_000mg after my opthamologist noticed that my optic nerve swelling hadn't gone down. However_ I have read that it may take time to find out what dosage may be right for the individual. Also_ my headaches and the pressure I was feeling at the beginning haven't returned. The pressure that I felt in my head is mild and the headaches can be controlled with tylenol. My eye also started to move again. Alot of the side effects also died down. As a reminder_ you have to make sure you take in potassium and drink lots of water!!! The disorder is still difficult for me_ especially since I'm pregnant. But I try to remind myself that every cure or treatment is going to come with side effects and what will happen if I stop taking it.,F,32,2  months2_000 mg 4X D,6/7/2015,Diamox

19, 3, Intracranial hypertension,When I first started taking Diamox_ the first 2 weeks were unbearable and my dose increased to 2000MG per day_ and was reduced to 1000MG because I couldn?t handle the side effects. Continual cramping in legs and feet especially at night_ wakes me up about 6 times per night and the painful cramping lasted 20 minutes each episode. Pins and needles in lips_ feet and arms all day. Continual ringing in ears that I couldn?t have a conversation or go to work. Tired all the time_ loss of appetite.,Lost 10 kg (22 pounds) since starting this medication due to loss of appetite. Still get the cramping in my legs but magnesium tablets seem to help as well as drinking lots of water. Slowly starting to regain my energy levels and feeling less tired. Have had 6 appoints with the neuro since and my optic nerves swelling have reduced as well as the intracranial pressure. Scheduled in for another lumbar puncture soon. My  vision hasn't improved but has actually deteriorated slightly_ but the headaches have completely stoped.,F,26,3  months250MG 4X D,9/8/2014,Diamox
20, 4, idiopathic intercranial hypertension,My symptomes are the same as everyone else on here_ the food_ the soda_ the weight loss_ trouble sleeping... I feel like a walking talking side effect! LolI am extreme in these few other things... I am extremely sensitive to light_ i wear special tinted glasses indoors to block out light. Numbness and tingling in hands and feet goes up my arms and legs if I get cold even when it's warm out. I have a hard time regulating my temperature so I am cold often. I have ringing in my ears like my head is in a washing machine_ there are times i lose my hearing. I have a sound sensitivity and I wear special ear plugs. I tire easily. My mood changes. I am starting to losing my hair. With all that said I recommend Diamox to all who truly have IIH! It Changed my life by making mine manageable again. These side effects are no picnic but they are a drop in the bucket to what I was suffering with before this medication. I've read some of the posts and it is sad that so many people gave up on this medicine after only a few weeks.

33, 5, Papilledema,tingling in hands_ feet and head. loss of appetite. Some lethargy when starting the medication.,I also had a tremor in my hands but I was also taking prednisone concurrently and would attribute that side effect to the prednisone. I found I was hit quite hard with the side effects of both medications at once including from the prednisone insomnia. I lost a few kilos but it didn't concern me and could also be attributed to the large amounts of water I was drinking. Although the side effects od Diamox are quite significant I found that drinking as much water as I physically could really made a difference to the severity of side effects. I don't drink soft drinks so I didn't have a concern with changing taste in regard to my other food. I would highly recommend just drinking as much as you can at strategic times when you're near a loo! I would get up to about 6L most days but I discussed privately with my boss that I wasn't 'slacking off' in regard to my frequent toilet breaks and she was quite understanding and discrete. When I was able to drink mass amounts of water I found I handled the meds quite well. The medication has done all it was prescribed to do. My optic discs have reduced as much as they are going to and I will be coming off the drugs in about 2months. I was able to avoid having a shunt surgically put in and neuro surgery so I don't feel I can complain as it saved my eyesight!

Lack of energy_   I developed swollen fatty knots under my skin.  Found out that it was because of the diamox.  I have been off of this drug for two weeks and I feel like my life has changed.

That is: tingling in hands and feet_ nausea_ loss of appetite_ some hair loss_ foggy brain and difficulty remembering things. The most severe symptoms for me were the weakness_ body aches and complete lack of energy.,I hope that this information can help someone else the way it has helped me. I went to my general practitioner and asked her if she knew of any ways to manage the symptoms so that I could function and not fall behind in my program (I am a phD candidate and am supposed to be working on my dissertation and graduating in the next year-I can't afford to not function). She told me that my symptoms were most likely due to dehydration (I had been drinking about 80oz a day). She increased me to 4 liters! It is A LOT OF WATER_ but by the next morning I felt better. I have energy again and I don't hurt. My hair has also stopped falling out. I still have tingles_ but they're annoying more than debilitating. She said a good test to determine if you are where you need to be hydration-wise (especially with this drug)_ is to continue increasing water intake until your urine is no longer yellow-but clear.   My neurologist just put me on lacix as well_ so I am most likely going to have to drink more_ and watch electrolytes. Anyhow_ I knew that I would have to increase my water intake because this drug was a diuretic_ but I had NO idea as to how much. I needed to share though because it really has made all of the difference in the world!,F,30,2  weeks500MG 2X D,2/3/2012Email,Diamox

I'm back to 1_500 - 2_000 MG a day with better results.  It takes 6 weeks to get used to this med and the ringing ears and diarrhea is probably the worse part for me.  The positive is that it does reduce the head pressure and makes it possible for me to work and function. I'm still waiting to see my eyes get better though.

Both of my optic nerves have hemorrhaged and I have lost some of my color vision. Severe eye pain and pressure and headache are for the most part gone now. Hoping that this medicine works so that I don't have to have surgery.,F,33,3  weeks250 4X D,1/15/2012Email,Diamox
48, 3, IIH/Pseudo Tumor Cerebri,"Tingling/pins and needles in fingers and toes and occasionally face (sometimes very painful)_ frequent urination_ ""mind fog""_ depression_ headache_ severe fatigue_ change in taste of carbonated beverages.",Almost all of the side effects go away if you drink lots of water! Also_ as you get used to the medication it gets much better (it just takes a few weeks to adjust). It works! My CSF pressure went down and optic nerve swelling decreased. However_ every 2 months or so my IIH symptoms (visual problems and headache) come back and they need to adjust the dosage. I am trying to be optimistic that they will find a dosage that works for me_ and combined with weight loss my IIH will go away. Don't assume the worst with this drug! At first it seems absolutely awful but it works and the side effects go away.,F,21,6  months500 MG 2X D,1/14/2012Email,Diamox

Memory problems & concentration problems; Dizziness;  Diarrhea_ Taste changes_ I am always freezing even when it was 90 degrees this summer_ some vision changes,After running mri's_ every test you can think of and 62 blood tests they finally diagnosed me with PTC In Jan 2011. LP was 25 took me down to 17 then i had another in Nov it was 25-29 took me down to 17 ugh not sure what good the meds are doing if its not lowering my pressures but it sure is helping with some of the headaches!!  My neurologist tried me on topamax and I had an allergic reaction so she put me on Diamox_ had an allergic reaction then my husband was researching and found that the cause of my reaction was cause of how fast they upped my dosage. So I started over and am up to 4000mg a day. Its helped alot till the seasons changed and now the headaches are back full force. Sometimes I wonder why I go without my Diet Pepsi so Ill go without and have me a soda and I rememeber quick enough!! The side effects suck but even with the weather changes here what the diamox is controlling is so much better than what it could be!!,F,33,8  months1000 4X D,12/3/2011Email,Diamox

57, 4, Idiopathic IntercranialHypertension,Tingling in hands_ feet_ knees and spider web feeling on face. Decreased appetite. Dry itchy skin. Dry mouth_ sometimes get confused.,"I was diagnosed with IIH Sept 8 2011. It was nice to actually put a name to the ""thing"" that was causing issues in my daily life. I was waking up in the morning completely blind and it would last for about 30-45 seconds. I brought this to my doctor's attention and he sent me to an Opthalmoloist. From there I was seen by my neurologist who ordered the LP. I have had only 1 LP with an opening pressure of 32 that when we were done taking off a few tubes of fluid for testing went down to 12. Since the LP I have felt that my head doesn't feel as ""full"" as it was before and I am no longer waking up blind. It take a few seconds for my eyes to adjust_ but I can see. I was started on the Diamox just after the LP and to me it seems that it is working. I am VERY thankful even with all the side effect for this drug. It was terrifying to me to think that I might not see my daughters grow up or to see my Husband return from his deployment next summer. There are so many FUTURE memories that this drug is going to help me see. I am so happy I came across this page it really helps to know others are having the same experiences I am.

58, 3, PsuedoTumor Cerebri,Tingling in hands_ feet_ face_ arms_ and mouth; Memory problems & concentration problems; Dizziness; Vomiting; Diarrhea; Sharp stomach pains; Drowsiness; Change in taste.,Diamox helps a little for my PTC_ but the side effects happen 24/7. It almost makes me stop taking it until I realize just how much it's helping my head. So if you think you'll have a problem with constantly being really tired_ always having your hands or feet tingle_ being sore or dizzy all the time_ having an upset stomach_ or not being able to taste things right.. Don't take this. Although it really does help_ and so I don't mind the side effects TOO much.. Just know it'll make you feel pretty icky sometimes_ but just fight through it and you'll be fine.,F,19,1  years250 MG 4X D,9/26/2011Email,Diamox
59, 3, pseudo Tumor Cerebri,the usual_ tingling in face and feet_ blurred vision at first but then improved vision_ bitter taste with carbonated beverages_ nasuea.,Started using using about five  years ago 250mg usually I would get relief in a few weeks.  Six months ago another episode was cured by the same dose_ but this time it didn't seem to work_ so I doubled the dose to 500mg 2X per day still no relief.  My symptoms are pressure and fluid probably CSF in my ears.  The pressure varies throughtout the day cannot correlate with anything_  I missed a dose last week and it felt like my head was going to explode.  Not sure what to do I definitely don't want to have a shunt too risky for infection_ so I'm waiting this one out.  I started with pseudo tumor when I was abour 20 and weighed about 120 lbs_ I certainly didn't fit the usual profile.  Had surgery to repair a CSF leak in my left ear in 91 it returned a few years later then faded away only to return again and again_  Now both ears are full.  Anyone have a similar experience?,M,58,5  months1G 1X D,9/15/2011Email,Diamox
