0, 4, weight loss(combined w/phentermine),I'm a hot mess! arms and feet are tingly_ cant focus on anything_ forgetful_ and i cant tell if i'm depressed about actual things or if i'm making things up in my head and getting overly upset about them. people around me think i'm losing it. HOWEVER_ i have lost quite a bit of weight with no real exercise or change in the foods i eat. i cannot eat very much though. i have to set reminders to eat at all and everything EVERY. SINGLE. THING. tastes awful. especially soda. works great for weight loss but i only plan to take until i reach a certain amount of pounds lost because it is clearly having serious negative side effects.,,F,31,2  months50 1X D,5/17/2015Email,Topiramate

2, 5, Binge Eating Disorder,Suppressed appetite_ extreme thirst_ taste distortion and ability to control impulse with sweet/salt craving,I have struggled with Binge Eating for yrs & finally found a psychiatrist who understands which part of the brain that controls this impulsiveness. I am truly impressed with this drug. I have read ppl having bad side effects but my dr said to stay on lower dose and you will still see benefits without the negatives. I would highly suggest.,F,30,7  days25mg 2x da,3/23/2015Email,Topiramate

4, 1, migraine,couldn't think_ concentrate_ or spell_ extreme fatigue_ limbs felt like lead weights_ stomach pain_ chills from being cold,Started at 25 mg first week-had no side effects. 50 mg second week and i no longer felt like myself. Couldn't make a decision_ couldn't use computer_ read or watch a tv show because i just couldn't concentrate and didn't enjoy doing it. I didn't have a migraine/headache but my skull hurt-mostly my forehead and sides of my nose-for days. I felt fatigued early in day and exhausted the rest of the day and could do nothing but lay in bed. I'm in menopause and usually warm but had chills nightly.Just could not function at all. When i lowered dose back to 25 mg got massive migraine with pain in forehead and side of nose exactly where skull pain was. Stopped taking as of that day.Never got to full strength of 100 mg.,F,55,2  weeks50 mg 1X D,2/6/2015,Topiramate
5, 1, migraine prevention,Started at 25 mg...within 3 days had to drop to 12.5 mg because of side effects. Slowly raised the dose in hopes to reach 100 mg...by the time I got to 50 mg_ I was a complete mess head to toe - physically and mentally. My muscles are complete jello. Hands and feet are numb. Tongue often numb. I've zero cognitive thought. I cannot answer questions. I do not know what day it is. Nausea and vomiting. Cannot sleep. Depression worsening daily. I cannot formulate sentences verbally. Cannot focus. Very forgetful. Have no short term memory. My long term memory is foggy also.,,F,44,3  weeks50 mg,10/24/2013,Topiramate
