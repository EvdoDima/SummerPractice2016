1, 5, Constipation,No side effects.,I take Miralax for constipation that is a side-effect of another medication. I take Miralax maybe three times a month. It works very well and produces a bowel movement either the same day or the next morning if I take it at night. It doesn't cause me any cramping and produces what seems just like a normal bm. I don't think I could take this for colonoscopy prep because of dehydration issues_ as I have a medical condition that makes dehydration very dangerous for me_ but for occasional use in low doses_ it works great.,F,26,1  days1 cap full,7/25/2016,Miralax

3, 1, colonoscopy prep,I had the preparation before and had similar results.  The last time_ I mixed it with powdered yellow Gatorade.  I sipped it (without a straw- no one mentioned this) and vomited after before finishing one 8 oz glass.  This time I just mixed with water b/c someone recommended that it doesn't taste that bad.  Taste was OK and drank small sips with a straw.  Same result_ after first 8 oz I vomited.  It was around 6pm and I was not able to eat anything else that day without vomiting.,"I asked my Dr. for an alternate prep_ but his answer was for me to get the ""constipation prep""  This was the same prep with an additional 10 oz dosage of Magnesium Citrate.  There were no instructions for mag citrate_ so I called the Dr office and she said to just take it. When? how much?  UGH!  Then she argued with me about Gatorade - like that made me vomit the first time. My beef is that my Dr. blew off my concerns about this prep and ignored my request for the Mag Citrate prep that I had with my first colonoscopy.  I am allergic_ or have a severe reaction to something in this_ and while this is probably rare_ I am probably not alone.",F,59,1  days230 grams 2X H,6/27/2016Email,Miralax

Day after colonoscopy am passing brown mucus and twice didn't make into the bathroom in time and soiled myself.,"Thought I was choosing an easier prep_ since I had no problem drinking this down in 8 oz gatorade over a 2 hour period.

I didn't start to have problems until after midnight with nausea_ dry heaves_ numbness and tingling in my hands_ dizziness and weakness. Called the on-call doctor twice_ first time he told me to try to ""stick it out"" and the second time he told me to go to the ER to be evaluated. ER staff said they weren't surprised and that they've seen this before.

I occasionally have to bump the dose up but not often.  I am truly amazed at some of the negative comments here.  Of course Miralax is going to cause some gas!  It's also going to cause diarrhea if you take a large dose i.e. prep for a colonoscopy--that's kind of the idea.   Miralax did not cause your sore throat_ your runny nose_  your itchy dry skin or foot pain.   It takes several days to work if you start with a small dose.

24, 3, Colonoscopy Prep,MiraLAX was mixed with 64 oz. of Gatorade2_ total 4 Ducolax pills for colon prep. I drank 8 oz. every half hour from 5pm - 8pm. After first two 8 oz._ I started feeling dizziness and abdominal pain. After the next two 8 oz._ I experienced very severe abdominal pain that radiated to lower back pain; all on right side. My first thought was that it had exacerbated sciatica nerve pain I had a few years ago. After completing the solution_ I was in acute_ excruciating abdominal and back pain -- worse than child labor pain. It was constant pain whereas I could not stand up straight. I couldn't lay down on either side without excruciating pain. I sat up in a chair to try to sleep; and I was up literally all night. My colon procedure was next day @ 2pm. The pain never subsided_ and I informed nurse and doctor of the pain; but seemed to be of little concern. Three days later I'm still experiencing pain in my mid stomach area and lower back. I've taken a couple of pain meds_ to no avail. Thankfully_ I never vomited_ but any standing or lying position this pain is severe. I may have to go to ER.I was not in any pain before starting the prep_ so I have concluded that this pain is caused by either or both the Ducolax pills and the MiraLAX. After reading about MiraLAX_ it is conceivable to think this severe pain is from the MiraLAX. In addition_ the pain worsen when I breathe (so it is constant)_ and when I cough_ yawn or sneeze. It has been torture and pure misery the last 5 days.,The MiraLAX worked for its intended purpose in cleansing my colon for the colonoscopy; however_ its side affects are terrible and seemingly long-lasting. I will never take MiraLAX again_ and I pray it has not caused irreparable damage to my stomach and other organs. The pain is contained to my right side only tthus far_ but seems to radiate across my lower back area. MiraLAX may work well for most_ but I will never forget this painful experience.,F,59,1  days8.3,11/15/2015,Miralax

37, 3, chronic constipation,My Dr. told me to take Miralax every day for the rest of my life. A few months after I started taking it_ I was really sick and diagnosed with staph infection in both kidneys.  The regular physicians gave me medicine after medicine and couldn't get rid of my staph infections.  They even sent me to specialists and it came to a point that people thought I was making up my illness.  I lost my job of 11 years because of this medicine.  I also fainted for the first time_ because it caused me to get dehydrated.  I went to the E.R. twice from fainting a total of 4 times. The doctors just couldn't figure out what was wrong.  I brought up the Miralax_ but they didn't think it was a problem and I would quit taking it for a few days_ but it never helped and I needed it for my constipation.  I finally decided 3 years of being sick_ was too much.  I decided to quit.  I was tired of not going outside in the summers because of the heat and I would get sick every day from dehydration (I had to keep Gatorade stocked up).  Please just be careful with this drug.  It works well for constipation_ but some side effects that stink. Including the constant bloating.By the way_ if you're new to taking Miralax_ you may need to take 2-4 caps per day (per my Dr)....it worked to get me going and then I cut back to 1 cap per day.
