1, 4, Reflux,None,I have been taking this for 6 years.  Never experienced any side effects like the other PPIs.  I love it- I do take a magnesium supplement as well _ as PPIs are known to lower absorption of Mag_ Potassium and Calcium.  Best PPI on the market!,F,49,6  years20 1X D,5/1/2014Email,Zegerid
2, 4, Acid Reflux,None_ but a slight increase in appetite.,Zegerid seemed to work fine for me.  I had bad side effects with a few of the H2 Blockers (e.g._ Zantac_ Pepcid_ etc.).  I also take Aciphex in the morning.  Both Aciphex and Zegerid are the two PPI's that worked best for me with little to no side effects.,M,49,3  years40 MG 1X D,10/24/2011,Zegerid
3, 1, Gerd,Pinpricks of itchiness on body. Itchy burning feeling on back. Feels like shivers across my skin.,,F,39,4  days20 1X D,8/23/2010Email,Zegerid
4, 1, Ulcer/Gastritis_ Acid Reflux,Nausea_ loss of appetite_ loose and urgent stools_ stomach pain_ extremely slow digestion_ exhaustion_ flu-like feeling_ severe dairy intolerance.,The first pill worked like a miracle! The 2nd pill had me feeling/looking so sick that my husband almost took me to the ER. Turns out I had all the symptoms of an overdose - 24 hours after taking the 1st dose! I had to take it less and less often until I was only taking 20mg once a week. And it slowed my digestion to the point that I got diagnosed with gastroparesis. I had always had a VERY fast metabolism before. You're supposed to take it on an empty stomach (this is no joke - if you have ANY food in your stomach_ the side effects will be much worse) and I often had to wait 20-24 hours AFTER eating before I'd even feel hungry again. A drink of water would make me feel full. This pill made me so miserable_ but stopping it brought the acid reflux back with a vengeance. But it was worth putting up with the breakthrough acid (when it never completely cured the acid reflux in the first place_ even with a very restricted diet) to get away from this horrible pill. Good news: it cured my stomach lining issues. Bad news: I'm stuck with more trouble than I originally had. It's been over a year since I took the last pill and I'm still nowhere near back to normal. It's been a slow recovery. This drug is dangerous. It works_ but only use it as a last resort - and BE MONITORED CLOSELY BY YOUR DOCTOR!!,F,26,6  months40 1X D,4/19/2010Email,Zegerid
5, 1, Acid Reflix,Chest pain_ tightness in the chest.,Began taking this for the treatment of Acid Reflux. Early on I had mild chest pains and an EKG came up negative. After about 90 days_ I again had chest pains and pains in my left arm. I spent two days in the hospital and test results showed nothing was wrong.
