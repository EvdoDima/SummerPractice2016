0, 2, Renal transplantation 2004,Brown crusty lesions spreading over my torso.  Some were so bad they had to be surgically removed.  Extreme exhaustion.  Seriously upset stomach. Skin rashes.,Eleven years ago i had a kidney transplant and since then i have been prescribed Neoral.  As the years passed by torso became covered with crusty brown patches_ like moles_ but larger.  Some i even had to have surgically removed.  They itch terribly.  I do not like this drug.  I feel it does more harm than good in as much as it really destroys the immune system.  I also feel it is time that as patients we no longer accepted the initial lame excuses of what this drug 'may' cause.  It DOES!  I can assure you.  The gums overgrow the teeth as well_ and bleeding and pain also occurs. Extreme stomache upsets and exhaustion daily.  Joint pain and walking difficulties occur over the years.So nasty to have to have this day in day and its a sad fact that the kidney is gradually poisoned by the dugs eventually anyhow.  Why are the drug companies so coy about the effects?,M,50,11  years100 2X D,11/11/2015Email,Neoral

9, 4, kidney transplant,I've taken this and other brands of cyclosporine for the 21 years I've had my transplant.  Bad nausea in the very beginning_ then no notable side effects other than extra hair growth.Currently_ the side effects are those of long-term cyclosporine toxicity--basically similar to mild kidney disease.,It's poison_ but what can you do?  Beats dialysis_ and then some...Take it with food to avoid any stomach upset.Currently I take the generic brand of cyclosporine.  I prefer it because the pills are tiny_ and come in a bottle instead of the blister pack...fewer unnecessary additives_ too.  I assume it's quite a bit cheaper than Neoral or Sandimmune_ though medicaid covers it so I don't have to worry about cost.,F,41,21  years,9/20/2009,Neoral
10, 1, psoriasis,increased hair-growth - OK on scalp but not on upper lip -; general fatigue; tingling in feet and hands; cramp under arches in both feet; had three bouts of flu due to reduced auto-immunity; dry eyes.,This drug has exacerbated my condition. I have suffered from scalp psoriasis for 16 years with small patches also on my hips during winter months only. I took Neoral 200mg daily for 4 months_ Nov 08-March 09 inclusive. I had no psoriasis at all on my hips. There was no improvement to the scalp_ however. Since ceasing the drug_ I now have larger than ever patches_ which are extending daily_ on my hips_ worse scaling on my head and_ more worrying_ it has now spread across my forehead_ upper cheeks_ around my mouth and anus. Prior to taking the drug I had not had a cold for over three years: I eat well_-lots non-psoriasis-triggering_ healthy food -  don't drink or smoke and live in a warm_ sunny climate all year round. I use chemical-free shampoo/conditioner on my hair. I guess it wasn't the right drug for me!,F,57,4  months,5/4/2009Email,Neoral
