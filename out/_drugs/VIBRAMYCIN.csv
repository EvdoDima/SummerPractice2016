1, 4, Doxycycline Actavis,Intracranial Tension HeadacheBlurred VisionClay StoolsStomach PainFrequent UrinationAnxietyItchy SkinConstipationInsomnia + Waking in NightFatiqueAssociated Herxheimer ReactionShaking and NervousnessIncreased Liver Enzyme CountKidney Aches and Pains and Lower Back Aches/PainBloodshot Eyes,Taking a high dosage for Lyme treatment along with Artesunate_ Bromelain_ Alpha Lipoic Acid and Nattokinese - a proven regime for Lyme Treatment.  This medication must be taken with food to avoid severe stomach pains.  Do as it says and never take on empty stomach.  This medication is effective against Lyme as part of a carefully planned treatment regime_ but the side effects are very noticeable and require monitoring.  My Lyme symptoms disappeared within 4 days_ but I must finish treatment regime to kill every last one.  For me_ the non-stop intracranial tension is bearable_ but I'm only half way into course.  I'm taking supplements such as Oral Liposomal Glutathione to help my liver_ as my liver enzymes have increases and I have intermittent clay stools and signs my liver is a bit sensitive to this drug.  Also_ if your on strong antibiotics like these_ then it must be balanced with a strong pro-biotic to replace the bacteria being killed in the gut.Taking this medication requires strong willpower as the side effects can interfere with day-to-day life.  Many people stop taking it mid-treatment.  I'm going to get to the end of the 28 days.  I can say that side-effect symptoms do start to decrease as your body gets used to the drug after a week or so.  My advice is to have family and friends to reassure you whilst taking this.  Increased fear and anxiety are definitely noticeable.,M,34,28  days200 2X D,1/28/2016Email,Vibramycin

5, 2, suspected prostate infection,I didn't get the nausea but got depressed and stayed in a really black mood. I started on 100 mg once per day and noticed really long_ intense_ nightmarish dreams. Increasing the does to twice daily was unberable because I felt violent and hated everybody. That scared me enough to drop the dose back to 100 mG once per day.,I was prescribed this antibiotic because an MRI scan showed possible prostate cancer but a biopsy showed nothing. The doctor told me to take the antibiotic for 30 days to see if the scan peculiarity was just due to some kind of infection. Whilst I would like to take the full dose_ I cannot as I felt I was going crazy and the rage I felt inside me was too frightening_ I am usually pretty laid back. I guess it's better than cipro_ the drug the doctor wanted for me to take - but I refused.,M,65,10  days100 mg 2X D,10/27/2014,Vibramycin

8, 4, Bacterial Sinus Infection,I was prescribed this antibiotic because I am allergic to Amoxicillin. I am also taking this with sudafed. After reading the reviews and the uses for this; I wasnt sure if i wanted to try it. But today i am on my second pill and so far i havent had any side effects. I have cut dairy out of my diet for the time im taking vibramycin. It also says to sit up 30 minutes after taking the pill and to take it with with food in your stomach and a big glass of water. It seems to be helping me mend and start feeling like myself again.,I have noticed an occasional rash that only lasts a moment on my finger and arm but nothing that i would need to call the doctor about.,F,25,2  days100MG 2X D,11/12/2013Email,Vibramycin
9, 1, STI-Urethritis,For the particular condition that I was prescribed_(Urethritis)_ the antibiotic was totally exacerbating. I took it three times for the condition until I finally realized what it was doing as the third time the rash that was a result of the Doxycyline was bodily(Erythema Multiforme-Minor). The rash is caustic and excruciating(unbearable) and massive amounts of Intensive Therapy Cream were mollifying.,I understand now that the rash occurred as the doxycycline is supposed to be used in conjunction with another antibiotic. I found out I was supposed to be using it with the metronidazole for the Urethritis. Three years later I'm still trying to find a doctor to prescribe me a course to eradicate the bacteria which now completely diseases me. I have Balanitis_ Uveitis_ Generalized Erythema that is Edematous_ and a Subluxated T10 or T11. I also almost ruptured a tendon a few years ago. My teeth are pretty well eaten away at the gum line.

20, 2, UTI,EXTREME SUN SENSITIVITY!!!  I went to the beach for the 4th of July while on this medicine---BIG MISTAKE. I hardly ever burn_ but used lots of sunblock just to make sure my holiday wasn't ruined. The medicine made me so sun-sensitive that I got severely sunburned_ even though I used sunblock and kept reapplying. The sunburn was exaggerated so much that even areas that were not visibly pink burned as if they were blistered whenever they came in contact with warm water_ other skin_ or anything else warm. I was also nauseous and even though the label says not to take the medicine with food_ I had to. I had to keep snacking while on this medicine and could not take it before lying down because it severly irritated my stomach and throat.  I hope I never have to take this medicine again.,,F,39,10  days 2X D,7/6/2010Email,Vibramycin

Every time I opened my eyes or moved my head the room started to spin wildly around. Then I felt very sick and I had to rush to the toilet. I kept vomiting for several hours until nothing but acid would come out but the need to vomit and the horrible vertigo would not go away_ I was nearly unconscious because of the violent vomiting reflex going on and on. Only at midnight I started to feel better. I had never before prescribed tetracyclines and after this I shall never give them a second chance.,F,46,2  days,9/19/2009,Vibramycin
23, 5, lyme disease,migraines_ light and sound sensitivity_ fatigue_ brain fog,I gave it a 5 - it wasn't the drug causing that_ it was a herxheimer reaction caused by the drug killing the lyme.

24, 5, Uknown Superbug,fatigue_ muscle weakness_ drenching sweats_ nausea.,I have a bug that cant seem to be cured and vibramyacin is the only antibiotic that will send it to a dormant state briefly.

My stomach bacteria was being killed off by vibramycin and would result in horrific internal pains_ nausea  and bleeding.

It works really well_ and I have occasionally stopped the prescription early because I was completely cured in a few days. I did use it full-term for the Lyme Disease.

32, 1, UTI,Extreme Nausea.,Immediately after taking it (w/in 10-20 mins.) I would feel SO nauseous_ I had to eat something_ even though it said not to eat 2 hours after taking it. My doctor prescribed this for a recurrent UTI (it was my 2nd antibiotic) and it did not completely clear it and then I got a different type of pain. I would not recommend this for a UTI.
