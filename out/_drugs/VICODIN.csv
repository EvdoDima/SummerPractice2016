0, 1, Wisdom tooth extraction,Intense nausea that can only be explained by my stomach actually trying to claw its way out of my body. I vomited every 20 minutes and any time I tried to eat or drink anything. When there was no more blood_ saliva_ and stomach acid_ I dry heaved. I cried pretty much the whole time and had a massive panic attack. At a couple points I laughed hysterically until it turned into sobbing. I was extremely anxious_ drenched in sweat_ and freezing cold. I was dizzy_ could barely move_ and it felt like my apartment was being spun into another dimension. Not only did it really not help the pain from my extraction_ it seemed to distribute the pain to the rest of my unsuspecting body. All I wanted to do was sleep_ but it was impossible until it finally wore off_ several hours after I initially took the drug_ but what felt to be an eternity.,Literally the worst experience of my life. I was sure I was dying. I would warn my worst enemy against using this drug.,F,24,1  days,3/8/2016Email,Vicodin

3, 1, Tooth extraction,Ok_ at first_ then felt nauseous and hungover..,,F,35,6  days10,4/29/2015Email,Vicodin
4, 3, Post breast lift,"post surgery I wanted to ""stay ahead of the pain"" so I began taking the Vicodin about 4 hours after I got out of surgery. Helped with pain very well for the first 2 days. The last 3 days the pain was at bay but I had a slew of side effects ranging from depressed mood_ panic/anxiety_ super increased heart rate_ feeling just plain on another planet_ shallow breathing to the point I was afraid to fall asleep until it passed. I was mostly surprised and dissatisfied with the panic/fearfulness and mood swings. I felt like I was taking a bad batch of illegal street drugs/uppers as opposed to the prescribed pain med it actually is! After day 5 I still had pills left over but decided to switch to Tylenol. Night of day 6 (first day not taking Vicodin) I fell asleep early and realized I had the deepest most restful sleep during that whole ordeal. Woke up next day feeling  significantly better as Vicodin was really getting out of my system.  Oh and constipation was not a prob because I used Metamucil and senna tea.",Good for short term pain. Watch out for longer use. Part of the time I felt relaxed_ slightly euphoric and pain free. Other part was extremely anxious/fearful but I've gotten used to dealing with anxiety from other experiences and have gotten decent with remembering to breathe_ self soothing and waiting for the panic to pass. Good luck to you all,F,26,5  days5x,3/31/2015,Vicodin

6, 3, Wisdom teeth extraction,Extreme nausea and vomiting,I was hesitant to use this medication in the first place and after this experience I don't want to take it ever again. I've been up all night vomiting to the point where I'm just dry heiving. If you need to take it_ I advise you to use caution.,F,,4  days,12/16/2014,Vicodin
7, 1, Tooth pain,Fine the first few times. The last second times _ extreme nausea_ vomiting_ head spinning. Felt hung over. Don't understand why I'm having this reaction,Wonder if I am now allergic to it.,F,34,8  months5 mg,11/12/2014Email,Vicodin
8, 1, Back pain,At first I felt a little euphoric but within a short time a horrible feeling of nauseau overwhelmed me. The room was spinning and I spent the next 2 hours hugging the toilet vomiting. I wanted to go to the hospital and felt like I was dying. I finally managed to crawl into bed and prayed I would fall asleep. In the morning I felt mostly better but still spinning from the night before and still my stomach wasn't right. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone. STAY AWAY!,,F,46,1  days 1X D,11/9/2014,Vicodin
9, 5, degenerative disk disease_ arthritis,Euphoria_ itchy_ dry mouth,I was taking vicodin on and off for 2 years_ but every day now for the last year. My prescribed dose is 20mg a day_ but I've noticed my tolerance going up. I try to skip days_ but the pain is awful and I find myself craving the vicodin_ which I do not like. I know it's an addictive drug_ but it helps my pain for right now.,F,32,3  years10/325,11/6/2014Email,Vicodin
10, 4, back pain (arthritis in spine),none really,Took this med for several years before my tolerance just didn't allow it to work anymore and doc switched me to something else. This worked wonders for my back pain and enabled me to function on a daily basis. It was great while it lasted_ unfortunately it is known for tolerance being a problem.,F,43,5  years10 mg 4X D,6/30/2014,Vicodin
11, 3, Carpal tunnel syndrome,Euphoria_ hot flashes and legs and hands_ overall Vicodin is for drug addicts it was somewhat unsuccessful at relieving pain and tolerance went up after a few days,,M,15,3  weeks10 mg,6/28/2014,Vicodin
12, 3, Back pain of muscular origin.,Euphoria.,More euphoria than actual pain relief. And it's usefulness goes down to nothing after taking it just a few days. A rapid tolerance_ moreso than other opiates. It's the type of drug that's only beneficial if taken every now & a Blue Moon -- not regularly. Really it isn't a great pain reliever overall. I guess it's prescribed so much simply because it makes patients happy for a few days.,M,49,3  months15 2X D,5/17/2014Email,Vicodin
13, 5, Colitis_ Migraines_ MS,I have been taking Vicodin for several issues as needed. It works great for my pain_ which can be severe at times. I do notice some itching and constipation_ but compared to my pain_ it's nothing! Be sure to drink plenty of water while taking this medication. Eat with a snack or light meal to prevent upset stomach if that is an issue for you. Overall_ this is a wonderful drug for me!,,F,34,3  years5/325,1/8/2014,Vicodin

15, 1, Tooth Infection,I would sleep all day which I didn't like because I couldn't take care of my daughter properly. I felt really sick all day_ every time I moved I felt like throwing up. It didn't even help with the pain of my tooth_ it just helped me sleep. I lost my appetite and lost weight since I couldn't eat.,I don't understand what is so great about this medicine.,F,17, 500 5X D,9/27/2013,Vicodin

19, 5, Chronic migraines_ depression,None. I use it as a prevention and treatment of migraines. Because it lifts mood_ increases alertness and energy_ I use it for severe depression that occurs in the winter. Generally take 2-3 a day. Taking more is counter-productive.  Works better than any anti-depressants I've tried.,,F,59,10  years7.5/350,1/26/2013,Vicodin
20, 3, Pain,nausea and dizziness,I know that doctors prescribe Vicodin as an effective pain reliever. However_ it is very strong and addictive. I've read that hydrocodone is about six times as powerful as morphine as a painkiller in this article: http://sober.com/vicodin.html,M,34,15  days30mg 1X D,12/12/2012Email,Vicodin

22, 2, back pain,Helped with the pain_ but basically paralyzed my bowels .,I called my doctor and they recommended Miralax _ but I already tried softeners and laxatives and nothing was working . I?ve taken myself off the Vicoden and am just living with the pain for now . I have an appointment with a pain management specialist tomorrow for possible epidural injections _ but what I really need is surgery for the herniated disc that are pressing  up against  my spinal cord .

24, 5, chronic back pain,My PCP prescribed Vicodin in stead of the usual crazy drugs for my low back pain; I feel sorry for patients forced into taking Cymbalta etc when responsible narcotic use can work wonders. The only side-effect that I  had was constipation and I didn't tell my doctor until the constipation had become severe.  During an exam in her office she was feeling my abdomen and asked when I had my last BM and when I said 4-5 days_ she nodded to the nurse who left the room_ returning a few minutes later with an IV pole with a big enema bag full of soapy water..and I got the how to prevent constipation lecture from the nurse and from my doctor as I got every drop.  Actually_ she could not have been nicer.,,M,57,1  years7.5 2X D,8/14/2012,Vicodin

28, 4, Sciatica/Sciatic Flare-up,Constipation_ Dizziness_ Drowsiness,Combined with massive amounts of Ibprofuen_ this helped me get through quite a bit of pain.  Typically I'd feel a little dizzy/drowsy for about an hour after but it worked wonders for the sciatic nerve pain.  If anything I would have preferred an extended release drug instead: I'd usually wake up in terrible pain a few hours after taking it before bed after it had eventually worn off.  The constipation is a whole 'nothing issue: if I actually took the 3 tablets x a day_ this would cause major problems with the piping.  By the third week I winded up only using it once a day or so when the pain was too much in order to avoid further bathroom disasters.,F,28,3  weeks5-500mg 3X D,7/12/2012Email,Vicodin

Severe migraines_ loss of appetite_vivid nightmares restless_ insomnia_ stomach cramps_ constipation_ weepy_ aggression between doses_ have to increase dosage after 2 days to get relief. It relives pain but causes so many annoying and exhausting side effects that I requested a change. I have a bad reaction/sensitivity to Hydrocodone which is in vicodin.

51, 1, Endometriosis,Horrible nightmares: first night_ I had nightmares and tried falling back to sleep but would go right back in the dream. Then I jerked awake every 30 mins or so freaking out. Extreme paranoia and the feeling as if there was something bad going to happen. I figured I didn't have enough to eat with the pill and maybe that was what caused it.

It wasn't great with pain but it made me sleep so it made it bareable.,,F,16,4  days500 mg,1/14/2012,Vicodin
53, 3, Wisdom teeth removal,This drug certainly does its job_ pain wise. However_ I became constipated_ couldn't fall asleep till 4am_ then kept waking up once I fell asleep. I had slight nausea_ and tonight I found out how paranoid it can make you. I was literally running around my house_ checking to make sure everything was locked_ like I had OCD. It was a terrifying feeling because I felt so sure something horrible was going to happen. Weighing the pros and cons_ I don't think I'd take vicodin again.,,F,17,3  days30mg,1/7/2012Email,Vicodin

56, 4, Chronic dental and testicular pain,"The most common side effect that I experienced was a false sense of well being or euphoria. While this is pleasant_ it can be troublesome because it makes me not care as much about my problems or want to address them_ and makes me lazy. For example_ I consider calling in sick to work even though I feel okay because I want to enjoy the ""high"" and my day.Other positive side effects I experience include increased talkativeness and desire to socialize_ increased enjoyment of everyday activities_ increased enjoyment of food and an increased ability to relax. The worst negative side effect I've had with Vicodin are fairly frequent nightmares (about twice a week) and a little nausea  with higher doses (15 - 20 mg at a time). Unlike most people_ I don't get constipated or experience an upset stomach while using vicodin. After a few weeks of continual use_ I feel that I am somewhat addicted to the medication_ but I don't feel that it's a severe addiction.
