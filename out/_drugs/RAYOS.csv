0, 2, autoimmune flare,I had finally fixed my digestion. I was having daily b.m.s. After starting this medicine I have not had a b.m. for two days now.  This is the only thing I have changed in my routine.  Obviously constipation is a side effect.  I have no gas or movement of any kind.  Hope I don't need an enema.  I will not be continuing this medicine for fear of hemorrhoids and colon cancer. Obviously hunger is increased with any prednisone so eating and not being able to poop cannot be healthy.,,F,35,2  days20mg,5/3/2015Email,Rayos
