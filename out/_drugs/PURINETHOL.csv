2, 5, Crohn's,Hair loss_ fatigue_ low immune system_ easy to catch colds and other illnesses.,Been taking Purinethol for 10 years. When I compare the pain I was in before starting this medication_ I would do it all over again. It has helped tremendously. I am currently coming off the drug since Purinethol isn't meant to be taken on a long term basis due to developing certain cancers. I have been blessed with two beautiful children while my disease was stabilized. I was unable to breastfeed because of the drug. Overall_ my experience was good!,F,37, 50 MG 1X D,11/16/2015,Purinethol
3, 4, crohns,Higher dose of 75_ then 50 mg gave  me a rash. 25 mg daily  has settled  it. I feel  like I  have  a totally different  body since  I  have  been  on 6mp. I feel  it's  slowly  killing  me. However  I'm  too scared  to  stop it. 4 re sections  over 42 years and  many drugs and  therapies  inbetween. My joints are stiff and  im constantly  fatigued.  I've  gained  8 kg and  my  hair  is very  thin BUT  I  am alive  and  doing  better  than  I  have  been  for  years. I'll  keep  taking  it.,,F,54,2  years25mg,8/11/2015,Purinethol
4, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,Very slight nausea/loss of appetite. Easy bruising + some hair loss.,Compared to my severe symptoms of UC this has been the only drug that has helped (apart from prednisone) and made life liveable again.

14, 4, Crohns,Non that I have noticed_ apart from weight gain. but thats a good thing.,I was diagnosed with Crohns in 2007. I have been on many different drugs for it. At one point I had to take 9 pills a day for the first year which worked for a while_ but eventually my body became immune to those drugs_ so in the end it did not help. After walking for almost 2 years with bloody washroom sessions (sorry) and constant pain_ trips to the washroom and losing about 25 lbs_ my Dr. finaly did some more testing and put me on Pretnison together with Purinethol. After 8 weeks I was off of the Pretnison and have been on Purinethol ever since. Even though I know I'm not cured_ I sure do feel that way_ no side effects_ my blood and liver looks good and I can live a normal life again. In the last 5 months alone I've gained back my 25 lbs plus an extra 10 lbs on top of that. I feel great apart from the occasional fatigue_ work out at the gym with no issues_ and as a musician am able to perform without any flare ups right before the shows. Sorry to hear about the others who have issues with this drug_ but I find it a miracle drug!,M,29,8  months50 1X D,5/13/2011,Purinethol
15, 3, crohn's disease,very fatigued_ dizzy_ trouble sleeping_  poor appetite_ and some nausea.,I've had Crohn's disease for over 20 years and was in remission for 15 until 2 years ago_ due to stressful situations in my life. I just worked up to 75mg a day and have noticed that I have less energy then ever before. I noticed my platelet count is costantly rising. I'm not sure what that means_ I will have to discuss this with my Dr_ I suppose. I've taken the next 5-6 months off work_ as I'm too tired and keep catching colds etc.. As a nurse_ working with the homeless_ I'm constantly exposes to various illnesses. All I can say is I hope this works!,F,36,3  months75mg 1X D,3/17/2011Email,Purinethol

17, 5, Crohn's Colitis,Some fatigue_ easy bruising dry hair and skin.,For the most part I feel blessed. I have had Crohn's disease since I was 24 and am now 54! I was on everything you can think of..prednisone_ sulfa drugs etc.I am currently on 50 mg of 6mp and 3 Asacol in the evening and 25mg of 6mp with 3 Asacol at night. I also take a prescription dose of Folate (Folic Acid) 5mg every night. I have had 1 fistula surgery and 2 colon resections. Since starting 6mp in 2000_ I have nearly been in complete remission_ except for a yearly cold and/or sinus infection_ some fatigue and dryer hair and skin. I do bruise a bit easier as well. With that said_ for me_ this was a life saver! I have my blood checked every 3 months and so far so good...Every day without dealing with that awful disease is a gift!,F,54,10  years75 mg 1X D,10/5/2010Email,Purinethol
18, 2, crohns/colitis,Was on immuran_ got too much joint pain_ and hard time sleeping. Purinethol seem to be fine but now that i'm into my 2nd month_ I feel tired_ nausea_ and just fatiged_ sleeping is starting to get bad again_ along with joint pain!,,F,34,2  months75 mg 1X D,9/9/2010,Purinethol
19, 1, Ulcerative Colitis,Exhausted_ Nauseaus_ Weak_ No Energy_ Hair thinned out dramatically_ no appetite.  Complete inability to digest any carbohydrate.  Blew up like I was 6 months pregnant every time.,"I've been dealing with Ulcerative Colitis for 20 years and thought this was finally the answer:  just SHUT DOWN my immune system so it became impossible for it to flare-up again - perfect!  But I was wrong.  I took this drug for a year and slowly became weaker and weaker_ had no energy_ got a cold or sinus infection about every 6-8 weeks_ was nauseaus and could only eat simple carbs because I was nauseaus_ my hair thinned out a lot (I actually have gorgeous Barbie hair_ so this was really terrible)_ but strangest of all:  I am left with a complete inability to break down Fructose.  Apparently it is metabolized in the liver_ and after a year of taking this drug_ my liver seems to no longer have that ability.  So any time anything with Fructose sneaks into my food_ I blow up like I'm 6 months pregnant and have to go to bed.  It is a horrible effect and seems to be irreversible.  I originally thought it was Yeast_ but my GI was able to diagnosis it with a series of hydrogen breath tests and confirm Fructose Malabsorption.  So my advice to anyone contemplating 6MP:  DON'T.  Just get off all meds.  Slowly but surely_ get off them.  Go to an acupuncturist or holistic practitioner.  DRAMATICALLY overhaul your diet to clean_ healthy foods_ and DRAMATICALLY overhaul your lifestyle to keep emotional stress at a minimum.  I've only had one ""allergy-induced"" flare-up in 5 years and I haven't been on any meds since the hell that was 6MP.  You have to change your lifestyle - you",F,33,1  yearsdon't rem 1X D,6/20/2010Email,Purinethol
20, 5, Crohn's,Fatigue_ lack of energy.,I have been taking Purinethol for almost five years and so far so good. I'm getting married in August and I would like to have a baby very soon. I have read mixed reviews on pregnancy and purinethol. At this point I think that I will probably stop taking it but I'm afraid that I might get sick again. Any advice?,F,29,5  years75mg 1X D,5/28/2010Email,Purinethol
21, 1, Crohn's Disease,Nausea_ brain fog_ fatigue. At 12 weeks I got shingles.,I was on 6-MP for 18 weeks. It had clearly suppressed my immune system as I came down with shingles which I've never had before. As I reduced my prednisone it was clear it wasn't working as all my Crohn's symptoms came back. As soon as I stopped the 6-MP the brain fog lifted. I'm now on low dose naltrexone which has been really effective with few side effects - the best Crohn's med I've taken,F,54,18  weeks50mg 1X D,5/5/2010,Purinethol
22, 5, ulcerative colitis,The last 4 years I've had skin cancer; I also have genetic/environment risks however I have had several squamous that required some reconstructive surgery. I have other skin problems as well. Exercise is a must however the body sometimes just can't do it_ never in the morning but I think that is part of the illness.  I have real difficulty with acension work.  I've had a heart stress test and was told the heart was fine however I was dehydrated_ I couldn't completely finish the test because I almost fainted.  I'm thinking it had more to do with the medication and its impact on anemia readings in the blood work.,I was steroid dependent when I started taking purinethol and it took 1 1/2 years to transition.  I have had periodic breakthru bleeding over the years however my current dose plus 3 Lialda a day usually will hold me.  I used to think I could stop the purinethol however it takes me months to get the bleeding to stop and my UC under control_ even with steriods.  I am religious about keeping up with the required blood work monitoring.  I rarely get a cold or flu virus so I think I am at the right dose on this medication_ keeping my immune system from overreacting.  I used to have severe allergies.  I do bruise easier and sometimes with the skin cancer work I don't clot quickly so they cauterize.  I still have periodic joint pain and redness in my elbows. Severe right sided pain flares still occur a couple times of year. For me_ as much as I dislike the side effects_ this drug has allowed me to keep my large intestines and am cancer free (my grandfather died of colon cancer).,F,52,17  years75 mg 1X D,4/27/2010Email,Purinethol
23, 1, Crohns Disease,A severe headache and diarrhoea which caused my Crohns to flare up.,MP6 gave me diarrhoea within a day of first taking it which flared up my Crohns. I was down to 1 a day on my 3rd 8 week session of prednislone but had to go up 4 a day as my CRP was up because of the diarrhoea the 6MP gave me. The next day I woke with a thumping headache and over the next week it got so bad I couldn't sleep with it (I only realised later that the headaches were worse in the night because I took 6MP before I went to bed). The GP said it was because of the increase of steriods and gave me tylex. This had no effect on the pain. 2 days later I went to A+E there after blood tests they found my CRP was 190 but they didn't know why?as my crohns was fine. I told them that it was the 6MP as I had been given Imuran before the 6MP and that didn't agree with me either. after 2 days of testing including a lumberpuncture they stopped the 6MP and within 2 days the headach was gone. But I was left with an enlarged liver and maybe some liver damage. My CRP is still up at 55 and I'm anemic. The doctor said that they had researched 6MP and there were no record of Headache as a side effect. But thats the side effect I got and just as well or who knows what damage this drug could have done to me. I spent a total of 8 days in hospital. If u have to take this drug be careful and just because a side effect isn't on the insert doesn't mean these drugs arn't causing it good luck :-),F,38,3  weeks5mg 1X D,4/8/2010,Purinethol
24, 5, UC,A little tiredness initially but not so bad now,I have had UC for 10 years after stopping smoking. Initially I was  not sure about this drug but since being on the Purinethol I have not had any major flare ups and must say that it is controlling my UC well. I did notice some tiredness at first but that has either reduced over time or maybe I simply got used to it_ Either way I manage to work play and run a few miles a week. I'm fine feeling a little tired if the alternative is cramping pains weight loss and spending half my life either in or seeking a bathroom!,M,54,2  years75 1X D,3/21/2010,Purinethol
25, 4, Crohn's disease,Fatigue_ memory problems_ hair loss but it grows back,Have had Crohn's for 31 years. Other meds did not work as well.  Not sure if I want to risk having a Crohn's flare to try to stop the 6MP and see if my fatigue lessens.,F,49,4  years75 mg 1X D,3/7/2010,Purinethol
26, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,None,"I have been ""on"" 6MP for five years_ after other meds for UC did not prevent symptoms and flares.  It worked for me almost immediately.  Although I experienced no side effects_ I decided to see how low a dosage I could get away with.  I only need to take 100 mg about once every two months in order to prevent return of UC symptoms.  It is true that I had a relatively mild case of UC_ but still_ bad enough to land me in the hospital twice in the first 18 years since I was diagnosed_ and I was never free of symptoms until I started 6MP.",F,56,5  years,12/10/2009,Purinethol
27, 4, ulcerative colitis,tiredness_ lack of concentration_ loss of appetite_ dry skin_ slight loss of hair_ mood swings,i was diagnosed 2 years ago with UC and 6MP definetly saved me from a lot of pain etc etc. however_ i still hopw there is a way of weaning myself of it. i would hate it to effect my fertility,M,18,2  years,11/29/2009Email,Purinethol
28, 3, Crohn's Disease,Bloating_ rapid weight gain_ headaches_ joint pain_ nausea.,Was on Azathioprine for a couple years_ which gave me no problems.  Not sure why_ but doc switched to Purinethol a few months ago.  Since the switch_ I have developed frequent headaches_ nausea (which I have never really had before on meds)_ moderate to severe joint pains and rapid weight gain.  I will be contacting doc to go back to Azathioprine if possible.,F,37,60  days,11/13/2009,Purinethol
29, 3, ulcerative colitis,chronic fatigue_ skin sensitivities_ skin cancers_ joint pain_ depression_ weakness_ difficulty concentrating,I have had uc for 16 years and I take 100mg of 6mp in conjuncture with lots of asacol.  This keeps my colitis from flaring up and my last colonoscopy looked great.  But at what cost?  I feel like it's eating up the rest of my body.,M,44,7  years,10/2/2009,Purinethol
30, 4, Crohn's,Nausea_ faintness_ dizziness and fatigue at first_ which subside after about one month. Still have lack of appetite_ possibly worsening of acne and tiredness.

Took this drug in the past for 3 years.,M,28,4  months,8/19/2009,Purinethol
31, 5, Crohn's,Just a lite fatigue. But I aways feel great.,This is the only medicine that has saved my life. I have had crohn's for 25 years.H Had my share of fistula and was on disability.

32, 4, crohn's,nausia,i was diagnosed with the disease 3m before i turned 11 and have been on an immune suppresant before for about 3yrs but when i started it i was put onto entocort too and had a side effect of nausia. ive only been on purinethol for a short while now but was again put on the entocort at the same time. only real side effect was nausia but i dont know which was causing it. this has since disappeared. my guts arent cramping and only occassionally ache for short peroids and my stools have firmed up quite a bit and im going to the toilet less. food intake is about the same. am alittle tired but thats prob due to the late nights and boredom looking for a job_ but after saying all that i dont know which of the two drugs is helping the most_ or if its the combo or if my body reacts well to these drugs. im having a blood test today_ so heres hoping its all as good as it seems.,F,24,2  weeks,4/6/2009Email,Purinethol
33, 4, Crohn's Disease,None that I'm aware of.,I started taking this along with Remicade infusions.  I take 50mg a day.  This along with the Remicade helped_ but I eventually decided to stop the Remicade treatments.  My GI doctor put me on opium tincture_ and that seemed to kick my flare.  Since then_ I've been pretty normal & just take the 6mp every day.  Anyone who's not having much luck with anything else aside from steroids may want to look into opium tincture or a similar narcotic since narcotics themselves cause constipation...kind of like a reverse effect.  It was an extremely small dose_ so I didn't feel anything & was able to go about my day normally without any side effects.  Just don't overuse any narcotics...I just read on about.com that the OVERuse of narcotics may cause Toxic Megacolon.  Great things we with IBD get to worry about_ right?,F,28,4  years,3/23/2009,Purinethol
34, 4, ulcerative colitis,When I first started taking 6mp i had leg pains for the first 2-3 months_ then it went away. Didn't notice any hair loss_ maybe a little bit of fatigue. I used to take it in the morning now I take it at night to fight off the fatigue and it seems to work. Also noticed recently that my cuticles are starting to crack and became sore.,I have had uc from 1999. Usually had mild flare-up every few months. Had a severe flare-up in 2006 where I had lost 20 lbs in two weeks and was dehydrated. That got me into trying some herbal supplements I read about in Jini Patel Thompson's book. I continued to take asacol until I had my last flare in 9/2007. Had to take Prednisone and then started the 6MP at 50mg a day. I have been free of any symptoms since I (reluctantly) started the 6mp.(No more Prednisone) I am starting to implement more holistic healing so that I can start to wean myself off of the 6mp but it has help me tremendously.,F,51,15  months,1/30/2009,Purinethol
35, 5, CHRONS DISEASE,originally was more tired_ but thats better now. ive had the longest cold ive ever had this year...maybe due to this drug_ i dont know. for the most part_ ive had little problems and its working. blood counts are normal.,,,,120  days,1/13/2009,Purinethol
36, 4, Crohns,slight hair loss_ low immune system_ light trouble sleeping_ little weight gain,I was diagnosed with Crohns 11mo ago. In & out of the hospital for a reoccurring abscess_ took endocore_ pentasa & prednisone & azothioprine together_ finally had surgery to remove a portion of my intestine since it would not go away. My GI doctor put me on Purinethol about 4 months_ I have felt pretty good_ I noticed I get sick easily. I hope that this continues to do good things for my Crohns. My question is it ok to take things like probiotics & immune boosting suppliments for normal health (like colds) or do they counter act the Purinethol,F,23,4  months,1/6/2009Email,Purinethol
37, 4, Crohn's of large,been so long so not sure what is Crohn's_ what is purinethol and what is just me,Been taking for so long I don't know. But recently talked to sister in law who was on it just a year_ and said she felt so much better energy and mood wise after getting off  of it. Got me thinking. I can't remember ever not feeling tired in my adult life_ unless I drink a lot of coffee. Maybe that would be the case anyway. I have had 5 episodes of bad depression in 20 years and still is low grade. As far as the crohn's_ purinethol has always helped and when I tried to get off it_ I immediately had terrible pain. I have only had to have one surgery so far and on 50mg now_ I feel lucky but wonder why my fatigue/ mood issues exist.,M,38,20  years,12/26/2008,Purinethol

Have some days where I can't get out of bed_ which is depressing as hell.,Been on the drug about 5-6 weeks so far_ running to the bathroom less but also unable to eat bc I feel so lousy_ so that may be why. Stomach cramps and joint swelling have not reduced_ was told must be on drug 4 months to see positive results.

So far I've had no colitis symptoms_ but I've only been off the prednisone for 5 weeks.

Stop looking for a quick fix.  This disease requires lifestyle changes and active management.  You can't just pop a pill like they tell you.  (I know_ I've tried that route).  After 1 year of 6MP_ I had the aforementioned symptoms.  They've been with me for 3 years since I stopped the drug.  Currently working with a Holistic Doctor to treat all of this and get myself ""back on track.""  I've been symptom-free on NO MEDS for 3 yrs.  They think IBD is a genetic autoimmune condition - fine.  Make LIFESTYLE changes.  NO DAIRY.  TAKE PROBIOTICS.  See a Holistic Practitioner.  Get out of the Western Medical System!!!!  Western MDs and Pharmaceutical companies don't make money when you're healthy.",F,30,1  years,11/24/2007,Purinethol
52, 3, Crohn's,Dizziness and vertigo throughout the day_ extreme sleepiness just after taking,Have only been taking it a week (50 mg)_ but haven't seen much about vertigo_ so thought I'd post to let others know how it feels to me. I take the 6 mp at night because shortly after taking_ I experience extreme fatigue -- almost as if I can't move. Am hoping that these side effects will subside over the first few months.,F,44,7  days,11/5/2007,Purinethol
53, 3, Crohn's Disease,hair loss_ joint & body aches_ excessive sweating_ extreme tiredness,I'm very leary about this medication. I was on it in 2002-2003 and stopped taking it because I hated the way it made my body feel.  I also had Remicade Infusions in 2003.  I cannot tell if it helped.  I was hospitalized this past August for a really bad Crohn's flare up.  My doctors brought up 6MP again and even though I had been against it for the last few years_ I decided to trust them since they stated many patients are on it with high success rate.  I've been on Prednisone since March and am finally down to only 10 mg a day (I wean by 5 mg per week).  I've been on 6MP again since August and started at 50mg a day and now am taking 75mg a day.  My blood work so far has been good but the way I feel is horrible.  I'm tired of waking up every day and feeling like I have the flu.  I don't know which is the lesser of two evils.  I've also come down with a bad cold/cough this week and fear that my immune system is very weak. Raising a 3 year old isn't easy when you constantly feel horrible,F,41,4  months,11/1/2007Email,Purinethol
54, 3, Crohn's,None initially. However_ after about 2 years on 100 mg. I began to develop skin cancers.,My dosage was eventually reduced after some blood work to 75 mg. and I stayed there for the next 4 years or so. The skin cancers began to appear in greater numbers_ first as basal cell then as the more aggressive squamous cell. No doctor made the connection; they all assumed I spent too much time in the sun. I discovered on my own the increased risk of squamous cell development in patients taking purinethol and I asked both my gastro and my dermatologist about it. Neither would admit it although they acknowledged the studies I found. After developing a new series of squamous cell cancers a few months ago_ I just stopped the medication. If anyone is interested_ try natural flax oil softgel capsules. I feel better than I have in years. Purinethol seems to have stopped the flares_ but it has ravaged my skin. I'm better off without it_ and if you'll research GI studies using flax oil in Crohn's patients_ I think you'll be surprised. Looks like the best kept secret in the world of Crohn's.,M,52,6  years,10/23/2007,Purinethol
55, 4, Crohnes Disease,None for the first several years but recently after getting married when my wife couldn't get pregnant I found I had a low sperm count and soon after developed atrial fibrillation in my heart.  I found other accounts of these side effects with others on the internet and soon hope to be off of the drug.  If these problems go away I will definitely attribute it to the drug.  Please ask your Dr. about fertility if you are on this drug.  The answer may shock you.,This drug probably saved my life but I beleive it caused other problems that I hope can be resolved and not affect me for the rest of my life.,M,29,8  years,9/20/2007,Purinethol

57, 4, colitis,,I am just finishing up with the predinsone after being on it all summer. I just turned 21 this summer and I havn't drank all summer because the doctor told me not to. Now I am off the predisone and about to go back to college. The doctor just put me on 6mp because the intestines were still inflamed but better than before. I talked to my friend and he said he drinks with fine with it and my research on the internet just shows you have to experiment for youself to see how your body reacts and there shouldn't be any bad reactions like there could be with mixing alchol wiht predinzone. My question is that the doctor told me to no drink more than 2 beers a week simply because I need to take blood tests for the first couple months on 6mp. If my body reacts fine to the alchol on 6mp_ will say 6 drinks a week really throw off the results in the blood test or which test do you think hes referring to that it could throw off the results. I want to obey the doctors wishes but I also want to be rea,M,21,2  days,8/30/2007,Purinethol
