Twenty minutes in I experienced the usual side effects with some chest sensations I hadn't felt before.  Got a rock hardon that satiified both the wife and I for about 40 minutes_ then climaxed after she did.  I was so tired out I couldn't ride her anymore that morning and later in the day jerked off while she was shopping.  Compared to Stendra which is almost as expensive_ Viagra gave me the stiffness and most satisfying hardon.,,,1  months25 1X AN,3/22/2016,Viagra
5, 4, For Erectile Dysfunction,This drug really works_ and works fast. However_ a mild headache is pretty much standard and it can last well into the next day. Make sure you have paracetamol and iboprofen on hand.,"Some people_ myself included are extremely sensitive to this drug. My first attempt_ at 25mg_ was an overdose bringing 2-day-long migraine_ searing eye pain_ uncontrolled sweating_ and rampant tachycardia in addition to a painful_ unending  erection. I spent hours with the phone in my hand wondering whether to call 911. I absolutely believe a full 100mg dose would kill me. I've since learned to use the drug in 5mg doses (maximum 2 x 5mg spread over half a day). Do NOT take a full dose until you know how this drug affects you. Be very conservative in dosing if you have any kind of heart rhythm problem. I would advise spending one quiet day with the drug learning how it affects your body before the ""big day"" of trying it with a sex partner for real.",M,,3  years10mg 1X D,3/15/2016,Viagra

For the last few months_ I was unable to maintain erection and truly concerned.  I was prescribed Cialis and Viagra.  I will comment on Cialis in that forum.  That said_ Viagra worked incredibly well.  In fact_ I was able to have another wonderful session with my wife 2x same night - So glad the blue pill is here!

However_ side effects include feeling flushed_ some palpitations_ waking up in he middle of the night feeling a bit nuts in the head_ and woke up with a funky feeling in my head. I am sensitive to meds as can be seen on how tiny of a dose i took. Happened enough times where i can positively attribute those negative effects to viagra (sildefinel).,,,38,8  days12.5 mg,10/3/2014,Viagra
28, 4, ED,Red face (flushing)_ Red eyes_ muscle ache -------I live in the Philippines and get generic Viagra.  It's called Sildenafil and made here by Amherst Laboratories_ distributed by United Laboratories and available in almost all Pharmacies. Six months ago I started with three name brand Viagra pills.  I was afraid to use it because I'd heard of so many dangerous side effects.  But my sex life had gotten to the place where I could no longer perform in bed.  So I finally talked to my Doc.  He saw no red flags in my medical history_ so recommended Viagra.  I was on my way from the USA to visit a young lady I'd been chatting with in the Philippines.  She made it clear sex was an important part of any relationship_ so I was very uptight wondering if Viagra would do the trick. WOW!!!  It was a miracle drug!!,"We spent 2 weeks of bliss. It had none of the side effects I'd feared. I did notice red eyes after sex but I figured that's cuz my eyes were tired.  I was using 1/4 pill (25mg) with great results.  . Obviously 3 pills didn't last long. We were in Thailand at the time and I found a generic from India called Komagra.  It was cheap but I was scared to try it cuz I'd heard so many stories about people dying from contaminated drugs.  But they were great!  No problems.  Still got some facial flushing and eye redness.  Back in the Philippines I found the Sildenafil.  Cost about $3.30 per pill (less than $1.00 per use)  Worked GREAT!! But over the last couple months my girl friend (who is now my wife) says my eyes are starting to look like a weir wolf after sex cuz they are so red.  Also I am noticing a dull aching in my back and shoulder muscles.  I'd increased to 50 mg (half a tablet) so I am thinking about cutting back to 25mg to see if that helps  ----To summarize_ these pills have been a miracle drug for me. My wife loves how long I can last and how large I get.   She especially loves the size and so do I.  She is very small and I am 6 ft.  What a GREAT combination for both of us!  SIZE DOES MATTER!!  Every time we make love she exclaims ""Wow_ you are SO BIG!!""  That really turns me on!! At first_ it hurts her a little bit.  But after a couple thrusts the pain is gone and the delicious fun begins.  So I am loving the pills but still concerned about the side effects.",M,69,6  months50mg 1X D,7/6/2014Email,Viagra
29, 5, ED,Very mild flush_ a bit of congestion_ and mild reaction in stomach.,This is a drug to use only if you need it_ so if you are getting erections on your own_ enjoy nature's gift while you can.  But if you need it don't be hesitant to talk to your doctor like I was.  I've learned to enjoy the mild side effects as I'm anticipating getting the best erections I've had since I was 20. I take it without food and lots of water.  After some experimentation the 25mg seems to give me a more satisfactory stiffy - the 50 feels less natural - more swollen than hard.  One issue - I don't get much precum.  Talk to your doctor guys.,M,57,5  months25-50mg 5X W,5/15/2014Email,Viagra

31, 4, Sustain erection.,Slight stuffy nose if dosage too high.  I take a portion of 100mg pill (about a quarter) at a time.  Also get flushed and puffy face and red lips.  Again if I take more than 50 mg in 24 hours.  No problem with vision or hearing.  Overall it works very well for me.  I use it to keep going after first orgasm - I have always had a quick trigger- never a problem when younger because I was good for 3-6 in an hour if I wanted.  Now not so much.  It help keep going and also seems to desensitize so I last longer before the first one.  Keep the dosage low to minimize side effects.,,M,48,1  years25mg,5/4/2014,Viagra

33, 3, To achieve harder erection,I took 2 x 100mg by mistake thinking they were 50mgs. Yes my erection was harder for longer but about 1 hour after taking my head looked and felt like it was going to explode. All my vision was with a blue hue and flashes_ after 3 hours the migraine style headache started _ I took ibuprofen and tried to sleep it off. In the morning my headache was so bad I hardly dare move. When I did move and looked in the mirror I looked awful_ swollen eyes_ dark rings_ puffed up face and the head ache from hell. It's made me realise this is certainly no drug to be taken light hearted. I feel really lousy_ like I've drunk a whole bottle of whiskey and then half a bottle of wine_ or something like that.  I say use it if you must but only take 50 mg and remember you need to be stimulated for it to work. You don't just get hard. Good luck guys.,,M,52,1  days200mg 1X D,3/17/2014Email,Viagra
34, 5, Minimal Difficulty Achieving Stiffy,none,I broke a 50 mg tab in half_ put half of the pill in an 8 ounce water bottle_ let it dissolve_ then I took just two swigs of the water; which amounted to about 25% of the total volume.  I did this on an empty stomach and within 20 minutes_ Mr. Happy was thicker and harder than I've seen him in 25 years; standing at full attention_ like a freaking flag pole.  Then my friends_ it was off to the races.  Wow_ this stuff is like gold.  WOW.  I've always been very leary of drugs_ so I wanted to start off really slow and I'm glad I did.

Jumped up to 124_ and slowly came down a little but was still rapid after 3 hours.,Tried this due to personal issues_ but will not be taking it again. Although it seems the rapid heartbeat is common and can be quite scary - I really don't like the feeling. And the results from what I took were nothing special to be honest. Won't be taking again - isn't worth the risk.,M,39,1  days25 1X D,7/27/2013,Viagra

As you may know the FDA cracked down on some of the more popular sites selling generic drugs on the net - generic4all was one of them..I can now recommend with confidence another excellent site - mynetpharma.comYou have to use your checking account - fill in routing number and account number. That's how they get around the problem the FDA caused when it persuaded Visa not to accept transactions with the internet generic drug companies.,M,62,10  years100 mg 1X D,6/2/2013Email,Viagra

41, 2, Problems due to diabetes,I had congestion within a few minutes of taking the medication. This was easily handled with saline nasal spray.,I got no benefit from viagra at all. I began to feel warm and that's about it. Manual stimulation didn't work_ oral stimulation didn't work. I switched to cialis and had much better results. I would like to caution guys about taking this just for fun. This is a drug that is meant for people that need it - not as a recreational drug. Are you really willing to risk the side effects when you can get an erection naturally? It's just not worth it. Also - watch your alcohol intake!,M,58,4  weeks100 1X AN,5/3/2013,Viagra

I continuously jerked for an hour. it was erect. I loss my stamina wore up my pants and sat down in my room. tried again after 5 hours. it got erect and remained erect after ejaculating as well.

I was worried. it was 18 hours of consumption. i went on to do my daily work. and tried twice at night_ and experiecned same condition. next day i visited a urologist and showed him my dick_ while standing. he pressed it and it got erect he tried scaring me by telling you need a surgery in which i will insert a needle and pull off the unrequired blood. i got scared.

43, 2, Erectile Disfunction,My husband took one last night.  He had been just taking half doses.  Tonight after he had a glass of wine he started acting really strange.  He started slurring his words and he said that his fingers and toes felt numb.  He had the problem with slurred words for several days after he took one for the first time.  That is why he had been taking a smaller dose.  Just like someone else said_ he felt like his brain and mouth are out of sync when he is talking.  I think that the alcohol made the side effects worse.  He was fine before he had the glass of wine.  I really don't want him to take this any more.  He was acting like he was really out of it and I was scared that he might be having  a stroke.  He went to bed early and is hoping to sleep it off.,If you have to have something_ take a smaller dose.

I sometimes take a small bite (1/5 of a 100 mg tablet)and chew it up and absorb it through the lining of my lip.  Taking it this way_ it takes affect in minutes_ and even when nervous about intimacy with someone for the first time_ no problems.  But I am thinking that it is not worth it.  Today I have the worst hangover and at other times I felt like it was saping my energy days later.

Flu lasted for 24 hrs. Test 2 25mg taken whole... effects same as test1. Test 3 25mg taken in tea with poached eggs on toast. 60 min hard on with NO SIDE EFFECTS_ 60 min pure sex no problems lady overjoyed. This has to be repeated as 1 test not enough.

58, 4, To have sex after drinking,I always flush_ and get a stuffy nose_ and have redeye that lasts about 1.5 days.,I actually take MALEGRA. I've found I can halve a 25 mg tab and the side effects are greatly reduced and don't last as long.,M,54,180  days12.5 1X D,11/17/2011,Viagra
59, 4, Post prostate cancer surgery,Blue Halo once.  headache sometimes.  First time I took it_ I almost fainted after standing quickly.  Sweating.,Worked for first couple of months_ seems to have stopped working (USA purchased drugs).  Found if I skip a day then double on dosage it helps. Recently bought drugs from Canada at half the price - seems to be legit and works same as USA drugs.  Bought generic from Canada (Singapore) - didn't seem to work as good.,M,53,4  months50 Mg 1X D,9/13/2011Email,Viagra
