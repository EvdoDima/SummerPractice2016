0, 1, Delayed Puberty,I am sure this drug works great for low testosterone levels in adulthood_ but DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR DELAYED PUBERTY. It ruined my life_ my personality and my growth. I was predicted to become 1.85 and this thing has prematurely closed my growth plates. I used to have a best friend whom i did literally everything with_ we were so close_ and when I started this all I felt was rage and emptiness. Do not take this for delayed puberty! I thought it would be great and I would finally grow and my penis would develop. Well I did grow and my penis developed but it completely screwed me up mentally. Wait until you are 18! to take this. It ruined me and left em with only anger when I used to be one of the kindest_ most peaceful little boys ever who had a best friend named zac whom i have lost now due to the rage this testosterone shots caused. Testosterone is not dangerous for adults! But it is very dangerous for children_ especially for kick starting puberty. Now my personality is ruined.,I took 100mg once a month. They did not even schedule it right. You would need to take it atleast weekly to have steady levels so my mood was all over the place. The half life is only 5-6 days_ so by day 30 I would have almost none in my blood. 25mg a week would have been much better. The best would have been none though_ as it just left me with rage and stole my personality from me. For adults it is very safe_ but not for kids!,M,,6  months100mg 1X M,10/5/2013,Depo-testosterone
1, 4, low testosterone,Headache_ ringing in the ears.,I take 1.5ml every three weeks.  The first day I normally get a headache.  After this I feel great for about two weeks_ then I start to get depressed and irritable.,M,48,1  years,3/20/2009,Depo-testosterone
2, 5, Hypogonadism,None really.  Once in a blue moon I inject into a nerve?  And the leg is a bit sore.  I use ice to numb the area before injections which seems to help.,I do weekly injections and it improves my mood_ energy_ sex drive and clears away the mental fog I had.,M,49,1  years,8/19/2008Email,Depo-testosterone
3, 5, FTM,High cholesterol (but I also had a genetic predisposition for it). Sweat more. I'm using a patch now and have more energy_ now that hormone levels are consistent. On the shots_ the levels drop before the next shot.,Increased muscle mass w/o working out_ lower voice_ fat redistribution_ hair_ more energy.,M,20,3  years,12/5/2006,Depo-testosterone
4, 1, Hypogonadism,Depression_ anxiety_ panic attacks_ paranoia_ persistent erotic fantasies. Mild occasional preapism_ increases in blood pressure and cholesterol. Heart arrhythmias. Sensations of excess body heat. Fluid retention. Impaired feeling of overall wellbeing.,I had bilateral testicular damage in late teenagehood. While the patch produces increase in physical strenght_ stamina and muscle mass_ as well as some loss in bodyweight - the side effects of testosterone_ especially on mental health and body fluid_ are simply not worth it. I am staying off this stuff for good_ and prefer the (far more mild) effects of hypogonadism instead. I wish I never have taken the drug.,M,24,2  months,4/18/2006,Depo-testosterone
5, 1, increase height growth,depression_ loss of concentration_ attention_ and focus_ lowering of voice_ slight aggression_ decrease in fine motor skills (in particular_ handwriting became sloppier).,I was prescribed Depo-Testosterone at 15 years of age to increase height growth due to short stature.  Initially_ I did not connect my symptoms with the introduction of taking the Depo-Testosterone_ but once I suspected a possible connection_ I mentioned it to my endocrinologist_ who_ after a while_ switched me to Depo-Estradiol.  Once I discontinued the Depo-Testosterone_ I noticed an overall (though not complete) improvement in my symptoms.,F,34,1  years,4/10/2005,Depo-testosterone
6, 5, Sex Change,none unpleasant,Voice drop_ libido increase_ hair growth_ and fat redistribution occurred.,M,21,44  days,2/20/2005,Depo-testosterone
7, 5, To increase libido.,None.,I take it to counter the sexual side effects of antidepressants. It helps me recover from an orgasm. By the next day I'm interested in sex again. Without it_ after orgasm it would be 4 day's before my sex drive returned to normal. Does not help with erection problems. It is very cheap if you get the injectable type. After injection you may feel a little better_ but more often than not_ the feeling better part slowly builds over a two week period (you cannot give yourself a shot and immediately expect sex).,M,55,8  months,8/13/2004,Depo-testosterone
