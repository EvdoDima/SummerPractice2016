0, 5, Found some in a neighbors trash,Just now took it_ said on bottle it helps with sleep. Said to start with 1/2 pill_ so I only took 4 to not be dangerous. Blood pressure obviously down_ feeling more relaxed than my tweaking butt was. Already optimistically happy that going through an unknown neighbor's house garbage was not a complete waste of time like too often.,"I might try to get this stuff prescribed if it continues feeling like this. Maybe I'll try taking the recommended dose and see if it would be worth it. If you don't mind_ do you have available ld-50 and fatal chemical reactions with other medications? As in don't ask what specifically I am asking about... Just whether or not you know if there is a similar no no like there is with nitroglycerin and Viagra_ or methadone and Xanax. I'm taking antidepressants_ benzos_ opiate pain killers_ occasional alcohol_ and things similar to ADHD meds. I'm bipolar of the ""sucks for you"" like level in correct scientific terms (acute bipolarus with psychopathinning hair disorder on acutely ugly subject)_ ADHD_ severely depressed_ hep C_ Epstein Barr_ IBS_ migraines_ hypoglycemia_ arthritis_ stretches of time with high incidence of irregular heart rate_ high blood pressure_ lifelong insomniac (been up 2 days so far. No uppers or even coffee to blame for it. Could feel I would not sleep tonight earlier (you can feel it)... Now i have hope that I might go to sleep peacefully and thank you even if it doesn't work_ the fantasy being normal is intoxicating..... Also some break damage from bad car accident_  borderline to textbook anemic depending on ability to think of anemia as something I should worry about. Are any of those factors red lines? Like do not ever even hold the bottle if you have these things type stuff. If so_ I'll let you know what it felt like to take it while being one o",M,27,1  days,6/14/2016Email,Tenex

2, 4, Motor tics / anxiety,"My daughter takes .5 mg in am  (before school) and .5 in afternoon (after school) for tics - mainly motor_ some verbal. This med combined with cog beh therapy (which has taught her ways to calm her own body/tics) has worked great! Tics were very noticeable/ disruptive to her...she still experiences tics_ but they are much ""softer"" and rarely noticable to anyone but her.",It took some time and some dosage adjustment. For her_ the lower dose given twice daily did the trick. She does have some anxiety and mild ocd_ but we do not feel it is an effect of the drug..just part of who she is. CBT helps with these areas too! Don't underestimste the benefits of this type of therapy for younger children. My daughter now has a bag of tricks to calm her thinking and her body.,F,8,1  years1,2/21/2015,Tenex

4, 1, Anxieties/OCD,Besides being extremely tired my daughter got flu like symptoms even vomiting. She also got very constipated. Over the course of the 3 weeks she became depressed and had no energy. We seen more OCD tendencies then before. Coming off the Tenex has been a nightmare.

5, 1, my daughter has adhd,My daughter was taking tenex amd concerta together amd was uncontrollable to all extreme. So we had to add risperdol to her night pills taking with calmed her down only a little. Igot tired of fighting the doctor to fix the problem so I removed her from everything just about two weeks ago and she has been fine ever since. The problem now is she has been going non stop number two to the bathroom and still does not sleep well. Her temper tamtrums has gone away. So I think no meds are better for her. Tenex was the major issue here especially for younger kids.,,,13,10  months54,1/18/2014Email,Tenex

7, 2, ADHD Anxiety,"It seemed to be helping his ADHD as he could not take stimulants due to ""seizure"" type reaction. Tenex caused really bad night terrors that he would not remember the next day. We correlated the meds to the sleep disturbance. During the night terrors he would not recognize me and he saw people that were not there. He has never even had dreams prior to this. He is almost 8 yrs old.",Keep a sleep journal.,M,7,2  weekshalf tab 2X D,7/25/2012Email,Tenex

10, 4, ADHD/Anxiety,this drug makes you very tired at first and emotional. STICK WITH IT! These side effects lessen after about 2 weeks. Eventually_ you may still need more sleep_ but you won't feel as tired as the first couple of weeks.,Works great for both my boys to help control hyperactivity and impulsivity. Does not work as well for attention.  My son also takes Strattera to help with focus or attention.  Has helped also control any tics that he might get if he's stressed out. Has not lowered his blood pressure.  Has done WONDERS for his anxiety. Without this drug_ he'd need an antidepressant for sure.  We'd like to stay away from drugs like Prozac since they make you hyper and that would make the ADHD worse.,M,9,3  years1.5 mg 2X D,4/28/2012,Tenex

13, 3, ADHD,aggression_ lethargy_ insomnia_ anxiety,Prescribed in August 2010 at 1mg per day in the evening.  Increased over Christmas break to 2mg per day.   He did okay for a few months_ but in April began becoming very aggressive.  He was in trouble at school_ so much so that I was getting phone calls every day.  This did not normally occur at all!!!  After being suspended twice in one week_ I chose to take him off the Tenex.  He doesn't complain of insomnia like he used to_ nor is he tired all day long.  Yes_ the hyperactivity is there_ but at least he's not aggressive and acting out.,F,7,8  months2mg 1X D,5/21/2011Email,Tenex

15, 1, pdd-nos,"tried this for my eleven year old son with autism spectrum disorder.  Noticed a spike in ocd behaviors like needing to line up all his toys in a straight row_ if I put something back on the shelf of the fridge and it wasn't ""just so_"" he would open fridge and fix it the way that seemed right to him. He was always uncrossing my legs if i crossed them_ knocked all my towels off their hanging spots. He also had wild outburts of screaming_ very aggressive behaviors_ and he was hitting himself on his face and legs repeatedly. I told his doctor to stop this medication.  He is now on 10 mg of celexa and the only side effect is increased urination. Behaviors still fluctuate_ but nowhere near as severe.",,F,45,4  months1 tablet 1X D,11/5/2010Email,Tenex
