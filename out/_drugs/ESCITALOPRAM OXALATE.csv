0, 3, Anxiety_ depression,Weight gain_ loss of libido,I took Escitalopram for a bit over from 18 to 24 and it did improve my anxiety and mood swings. It didn't do much for the depression unfortunately and one of the side effects was the complete disappearance of my libido.When I stopped taking it_ there were a couple of months where my sex drive slowly started getting back and then after 3/4 months it came back full force_ to the point where I feared I had become some kind of sex addict overnight. It took almost 6 months before my libido stabilized but I haven't had any problem ever since.,F,26,7  years15 1X D,5/30/2016,Escitalopram oxalate
1, 2, Anxiety_ Panic_ Mild Depression,Changed From Brand Name Lexapro 1 Month Ago - relapse of anxiety_ horrible mood swings_ return of panic attacks_ no energy_ diarrhea_ nausea.....,The efficacy of Escitalopram (generic) is far less than the Lexapro (Brand Name).  I have been on Lexapro for 2 1/2 years with fantastic results.  I have severe anxiety with panic attacks and Lexapro has done wonders far more than any other AD I had tried previously.  A month ago was the first time I had the prescription refilled with the generic form and within a week my friends and family started noticing I was getting very moody and just wasn't myself.  2 weeks into the change to generic I started feeling very anxious and noticed slight zaps of panic attacks setting in.  Around this time I also started having diarrhea and was getting nauseas.  1 Month into the change to generic I was back to being anxious with panic attacks_ horrible mood and feeling dull and depressed.  I called my Doctor to swith me back to the brand name but had to wait for my insurance to approve it.  In the meantime_ my Pharmacist gave me a few Brand Name Lexapro to get me through until my insurance approved it.  From the first dose I started noticing subtle improvement and three or four days later I was totally feeling better.Now I know everyone reacts differently to these kinds of meds so this is pretty much my opinion_ but this generic is NOT the same as it's brand name and I won't be surprised if it doesn't start to receive more poor reviews as it is new to the market this year.

2, 5, DEPRESSION,HAVE BEEN WEANING OFF_ FROM 30 TO 20 GRADUALLY AND NOW I AM ON 10. FEELING OK. CAN I GO FROM 10 TO 0 AND HOW LONG,THEY HAVE WORKED FOR ME..,M,74,6  months30 1X D,6/7/2012Email,Escitalopram oxalate
3, 2, depression,Sinus congestion with plugged ears in the morning_ lowered energy_ occasional numbness and tingling in hands_ arms_ legs. Felt down and pessimistic. Appetite increased. Digestion was affected.,I have a gluten intolerance and while I never had a problem with the brand name drug Lexapro_ this generic really did not work for me. I suspect it contains gluten. I have switched back to the brand name because it is really not worth it to experience these side effects; it's worth it to pay more fro the brand name.,F,37,3  weeks10 1X D,5/22/2012,Escitalopram oxalate
4, 4, Depression/anxiety,Tiredness in the afternoons_ weight gain,This drug has been very good for calming my mind and stopping anxious and fearful thoughts...however_ I have recently cut down to 5mg with a goal to wean myself off completely_ as I'm fed up with being so tired and with the weight gain.,F,45,4  years10 1X D,10/6/2011Email,Escitalopram oxalate
