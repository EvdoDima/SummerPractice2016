0, 5, ADHD,Nice uplifting feeling and euphoria slightly_ but it reminds me of Dexedrine slightly.,I can focus on the tasks at hand and this stuff helps me to do my weight regimen like it was nothing. Crank up some music and you feel invisible while doing anything physical. It doesn't get your heart racing like Adderal did for me and once again it's very close to Dexedrine in it's effects.If I get to speedy_ I just eat something_ or even drink a beer in the evening to mellow out. I sleep great after a couple beers. Like 6-10 hours straight. Great medication if you have motivational issues like I do with my adhd.,M,49,2  months30mg 2X D,6/20/2016,Phentermine hydrochloride

5, 5, I want to lose 20 lbs.,Side effects: GREATLY curbs my appetite_ creates inability to sleep at night_ gives me energy throughout the day_ heightens libido,I was 140 lbs. and desire to lose 20 lbs. I was advised by dr. to take 1/2 a tablet in morning & other 1/2 midday. After a wk._ I knew this was an overdose for my body size. I decided to take only 1/2 a pill each morning. This dosage works perfectly for me. I am seldom hungry_ have great energy_ and I love my SKY HIGH sex drive. I am worried that my sex drive will diminish over time with cintinued use of this drug. My husband is elated with my constant desire for sex. I have lost 10 lbs. in 3 weeks and feel quite sexy. I feel like I can reach my goal while taking this drug. It will be a challenge_ once I have reached my goal and discontinue use of this drug_ to keep my weight down_ I fear. I also want to keep my high sex drive.

8, 4, Weightloss,Dry mouth_ constipation_ light headed the first day_ lack of sleep the first two-three days.,I started phentermine on 7/18 and tomorrow_ 11/15_ I do my 4 month weigh in. I started at 242.2 and today I am at 210.4! Overall_ I am very happy with me decision to take this medication. I have no cravings when I take it_ have more energy_ and the dry mouth side effect has me drinking more water. It's not magic and you can still mess up. I don't take it everyday_ I probably have skipped around 35% of the time. I don't like feeling like I have to rely on it and I also know that some days I don't need it. I don't take it if I have to take sudephederine. I see this medication as a way to have more energy to get in the habit of working out_ make a habit of drinking more water_ and finding new (healthier) foods since no food tastes amazing/I don't miss some foods.,F,25,90  days37.5 1X D,11/24/2014,Phentermine hydrochloride
9, 5, Weight loss,"No strong side effects at all for me. The first couple days there was a little ""fizzy"" feeling in my head_ but after that I don't even know I've taken it_ except I have almost no appetite.  And like others have said_ you get dry mouth and drink a lot of water_ but that's what you should do anyway when you're trying to lose weight.",I been taking phentermine for 8 weeks now (one tablet a day around 11:00 am) and have lost 28 pounds. I feel so much better than I have in years_ I'm exercising more_ have more energy_ so I'm going to go another four weeks and try to lose 10 more. Then that will be it.  No bad side effects to speak of for me_ so all I can say is I'm very pleased with phentermine as an appetite suppressant and diet aide.,M,66,8  weeks37.5 mg 1X D,9/20/2014,Phentermine hydrochloride
10, 5, To jump start my weight loss - obes,Lots of energy and Dry mouth - my doctor prescribed it to me because I am extremely overweight and suffer from high blood pressure. I took it as soon as I got up every morning and never felt hungry or had a desire to eat. Many days_ I had to force myself to eat something! I was always thirsty though_ so I drank water constantly - all day long. It's been 2 months since I started taking this medicine_ and I've lost 35 pounds!! I also had more energy so I've been able to excercise more and actually started eating healthier!,,F,36,2  months37.5,7/26/2014Email,Phentermine hydrochloride
11, 3, weight loss,Severe heart palpitations,I asked to be started on Phentermine because I take Depakote and Seroquel for Bipolar Disorder and it's nearly impossible to lose weight while taking those. We started me on a half of a 37.5mg. tab. The first 4 days were great_ I felt no hunger and stayed within my caloric limit. After that_ the hunger came on slowly day after day until it was pretty much the same as it was before taking the pill. At about 2 weeks_ the heart palpitations started and by 21 days_ they were so bad I couldn't concentrate on anything but the fact that it felt like my heart was pounding out of my chest_ so we discontinued the drug. I think it may be a good drug for some people_ but if one has any type of mental illness they should be careful of the psychological effects (although I didn't have any from this low dose). I usually tolerate drug side effects pretty well but I can't tolerate this particular effect.,F,42,21  days18.75 1X D,8/14/2013Email,Phentermine hydrochloride

20, 5, Weight loss,None- eventually quit working,It was amazing.  I felt great.  Take it first thing before eating breakfast.  You need to curb your caffeine intake if you don't want to feel shakey.  I felt amazing_ had energy to hit the gym_ but you need to have intrinsic motivation and knowledge about how to eat right.  No processed foods which stimulate your appetite.  I gave up expensive coffee's and creamers_ pop and ate more natural whole foods.  I used my energy for good and not for evil... so I hit the gym and overcame my anxiety about going.   You have to want it_ you have to know how to get it and you have to still put good practices into play- this will take you where you want to go.  Unfortunately_ it stopped working for me after about three months.  I went from 223 to 165 and am currently back up to 180_ but suffered from an injury which has stopped me from exercising and caused some depression.  I am hoping to restart again in September and get back to where I want to go- my goal is 145.,F,41,3  months37.5mg 1X D,8/22/2010Email,Phentermine hydrochloride

Makes you energetic and focused like Adderall as well as decreasing the appetite. Effectiveness can wear off over time. I found that if I forget to eat sometimes I become really agressive_ impatient_ and irritable. I honestly can't distinguish this drug from Adderall_ or even cocaine. It might as well be called Prescription Coke.,F,25,6  months,7/15/2009,Phentermine hydrochloride

So_ after a month of that_ my doctor said to break tablet in half and take 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 around 2pm....tried that and still did not work well at all.

Of course it suppressed my appetite (my initial reason for taking it). You develop tolerance to this drug- thus you need more pills for the same effect; if it's that ""high"" your seeking. Other side effects after your 6-8 hour ""highs"" & ""no appetite"" is followed by feeling very tired but unable to achieve quality sleep. As others mentioned_ it makes you very talkative / extroverted; you get a lot of work done because it just presents you with all this ambition.

44, 5, appetite control,dry mouth_ sleeplessness_ irritability_ sounds weird but it made me much more talkative_ more outgoing_ more focused_ more energetic,I started taking this about a month ago and so far i have lost a healthy 20lbs.  If your mind is telling you that you're hungry_ when you go to find something to eat nothing sounds good so you end up skipping snack time or eating much less.  I used to be able to eat an unbelievable amount of food which made me gain weight faster than anything_ even though I was eating healthy food_  but now I eat very sensibly.  In order to keep the weight off though you must try your best to eat 3-6 small meals a day so your body doesn't go into starvation mode and start storing everything that you do eat.  Also_ when you stop taking the medication_ your lifestyle change of the way you eat is what will help to not pack on the pounds again.,F,20,1  months,3/5/2007,Phentermine hydrochloride
