2, 4, resistant depression + 30mg lexapro,Very bad headache the first day. I had to quit for one day then started up again with .25 (pill cut in half)_ then next day .5.,My doctor gave me the starter kit_ it has 7 dosages of .5 mg_ then 7 dosages of 1.0 mg.  After than you fill a prescription from doctor if you want to.  This was given to me for depression not responding well to 30 mg. of lexapro and also binge eating.  The first day I had a whopping headache_ so did not take the next day.  Then I took .25 in the morning and took the lexapro at night.  I did not have much of a headache.  The next day I took .5 in the am and then the lexapro at night.  Very light headache.  The next day_ same thing and no headache.  I feel gently in a brighter mood_ very subtle_ like I can listen to and apply my own positive self talk.  Appetite seems a little less_ no binging yet.  Sleep not too bad_ actually fall asleep within one to one half hour which is a big deal for me as I have had horrible sleep problems in the past.  I have ambien but havent taken it all since starting this.  I also use 1/4 teaspoon estriol cream rubbed on my wrists or belly and all menopause symptoms have vanished. I am cautiously optimistic and will keep writing about this.  Adding on to an antidepressant is so new to me.  I loved prozac but did not like the sleeplessness and the sexual side effects.  It obliterated ANY feeling!! Not good for a woman that still enjoys her husband.,F,58,5  days.5 start 1X D,5/4/2016Email,Rexulti
