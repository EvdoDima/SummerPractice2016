2, 5, Hypertension,Because of switching jobs and the new insurance rules I have been off of Micardis 2 times in the last 4 years.  Each time I have been taken off and substituted a different BP medicine I have major problems.  The last drug Losartan kept me awake at night and caused constipation and worst of all I was tired all the time.  Second day on Micardis and I feel great again!!,I would guess there are some side effects but this is the best medication I have ever used.,M,64,4  years80/25 1X D,12/5/2011,Micardis hct
3, 1, High BP,Severe dizziness to the point where I was nauseous and could not focus on daily activities.  I felt like I was in a fog all day.  Headache all the time. I could not sleep at night.  Very restless.  I only recently found out this was due to the Micardis when I missed a couple of days due to not getting it refilled before running out.  I felt so much better when NOT taking the Micardis that I knew all of my problems over the last few months were due to this drug.  I stopped taking the drug and all my problems are gone.,Terrible medication.  Will never take again.,F,52,10  months80mg 1X D,2/19/2010,Micardis hct
4, 2, slightly high blood pressure,sore throat_ violent coughing_ slight headache_ hot flushes_ feels like flu or bad cold. maybe it is ??????????,not sure whether blood pressure has improved yet. If it is causing the way I feel I wont be able to continue,F,63,15  days,10/7/2009,Micardis hct
5, 2, high blood pressure,Headaches_ lightheaded_ tired all the time. Stuffy nose especially at night and toothache pain that I believe is due to sinus pressure. After about 2 months on it_ my sodium levels are real low and I feel sick to my stomach all the time. Worse for several hours after taking it.,My doctor is taking me off it due to the low sodium levels,F,47,2  months,11/22/2008,Micardis hct
6, 2, slight hbp,None for days 1 2 and 3.Woke up day 4_ took tablet of 40 mg at proper time. 1.5 hours later took a nurofen plus_ just 1. within an hour I felt I could faint on and off. My heart was wanting to beat out of my chest. I was irritable and couldnt work out what I was doing. My partner returned home and asked if I was anxcious. I wasnt aware I was till he asked. Things got worse with the irradic heart beat. Scared me senceless,Arranged to go straight back to Doctors. Mine wasnt available so spoke to another. He did a BP test and it was down from the 4 days before. He ordered an ECG. This was fine also. I admitted that I had drank a few beers over 6 hours the night before but he didnt seem worried. He has taken me off the medication_ and asked I up my fitness a bit more and concentrate on my diet. I am in a healthy weight range and am fairly active. BP and cholesterol are in my family unfortunatly. I know I will get my BP under control thru exercise and diet. (I will even cut back on the beer !) as it really wasnt so high anyway. I will never take that medication again after suffering an anxiety attack like that. I felt I was going to have a heart attack. I think the first Doctor should have given me a chance to lower my BP by myself before jumping in to medicate.,F,41,4  days,10/10/2008,Micardis hct
7, 1, High Blood Pressure,DO  NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO SULFA!!!  Vision changes_ Shortness of breath_Blood pressure bottomed out_ Cardiogenic shock_,I did not know I had an allergy to Sulfa_ never having a problem before I was told to take this medication for high blood pressure_ and return to physician's office in one month...after taking 1st pill on my way home_ I was lucky enough to pull up behind a policeman and asked if he would call an ambulance. Arriving at the hospital_ I was complaining I was unable to breathe_ and was going down fast_intubated and transported to Georgetown ICU_ lucky to be here...,F,57,1  days,6/30/2008,Micardis hct
8, 2, High Blood Pressure/CHF,Chronic sinus infections_ nausea_ weight gain,If my GP had listened and educated himself concerning the side effects_ I think I would have been more open to sticking with the Micardis HCT.  Hyzaar was dreadful-bp was never under control with it like it is with Micardis but I have had 3 sinus infections over the last 16 months and gained 40 pounds since starting it.  I don't eat more (kept a food journal) but my metabolism is at a crawl now and I have hot flashes even though I am not menopausal. Since I found this website I am now sure it is due to this drug.,F,41,18  months,6/6/2008Email,Micardis hct

11, 4, ,dizziness,The blister pack is very strong and requires a knife to open it;I used 40mg for a year_ then switched to 80mg and cut the pill in half. The second year_ I took the full 80 mg. Lately_ I switched to regular Micardid (without the HCT). With Metropolol at night_ my BP is about 140/90 in the morning and down to 120/80 in the afternoon.,M,74,2  years,3/31/2007,Micardis hct
12, 4, High Blood Pressure,After trying four different blood pressure medicines_ my Dr. put me on this one.  It has kept my blood pressure under control the best_ but I do experience some dizziness and light headedness at times.  I am on the 80 mg dose_ and wonder if a lower dose would be better.  Dr. does not seem to think so.  I will try for a while longer and see if the dizziness goes away.  I have headaches each day too_ but not sure if it is from the Micardis Hct.,,F,42,2  months,12/9/2006,Micardis hct
