0, 4, Arrythmia,I've experienced ringing in the ears_ strange muscle pain in legs_ some cramping_ extreme tiredness,Hava had no episodes with heart but wonder if drug is worth the side effects,M,56,12  months50 2X D,11/26/2015,Tambocor
1, 5, arrhythmias,I had no side effects taking tambocor_ but when I took the generic had bad side effects from head feeling foggy_ anxiety_pounding pulse_and the strongest afib episode to date,I was put on Tambocor back in the early 1990's for arrhythmias.Couldnt afford it so I stopped taking it.Never had any arrhythmias while taking it.Fast forward to present_wore an event monitor for 30 days_found I haveparoxysmal afib.Told my cardiologist I use to take tambocor and wouldnt mind taking it again.So I went to the hospital to be observed for the first 5 doses_still had a few spits and sputters of afib.Came home Sunday and didgood until Wednesday afternoon I had a badafib episode like none before.Then I started looking how others complained about the generic version.Well I quit taking it until I get back in.Going to go with the ablation and non generic tambocor,M,47,5  days,11/21/2015,Tambocor
2, 2, Afib,Spaced out feeling_ nervousness_ tinnitus and aching leg muscles,Have only been on this drug (Tambocor) for 14 days and it has helped with controlling my afib_ but with a cost of side effects that annoy the hell out of me and some of them may not go away with continued use. This drug can have an ototoxic affect on hearing and with me it has. (Actually if you look up ototoxic drugs and look at the list it may surprise.) My spaced out feeling emerged about 4 days after starting it and is probably my biggest annoyance_ but now after 13 days the pains in my leg muscles is also very hard to accept. Local doctors don't believe these side effects are related to the drug_ but it is the only new one I have been put on_ so what the ????,M,64,14  days50mg 2X D,8/5/2015,Tambocor
3, 2, Post Ablation for AF,Tight chest_ dizzy_ increase in urination_ difficult to form constructive sentences_ rapid heart rate_ shortness of breath when walking,I had my first ablation 12 years ago and prior to that took beta blockers. After the first ablation no tablets ! I still had AF but my cardiologist refused to accept the ablation did not work so I had to live with it. Just found a new German cardiologist and had 2 ablations... He has put me on this drug for 3 months post ablation to control any post Ablstion AF during the scaring period... Not convinced about the drug_ maybe my body is not used to taking heart drugs so that maybe why my side effects are so significant.,F,40,3  days100,3/1/2015,Tambocor
4, 5, AFib,About 2 years ago I was diagnosed with Meniere's disease_ and as doctors often see no distinction between the actual disease and the SYMPTOMS of the disease_ I have no way of knowing if my tinnitus is related to the drug or not.,This has definitely helped.  I started throwing my first PVCs in my teens_ and as I got older they increased.  I'm sure my bout with chemo at the age of 42 didn't help.  When I'm tired or take in too many stimulates_ I will experience the arrhythmia_ but unlike NOT taking the drug_ they last a few seconds before correcting.  My Cardiologist feels this drug is a chemical version of ablation_ and since I also have a right atrium blood clot (from the chemo port I learned later I may have never needed)_ not physically touching the heart is advised_ even though the clot was there for 18 years before a cardiac scan for the Afib found it.  Fortunately the clot is well seated_ away from any valves_ and actually seems to be calcifying.  I'm fortunate my dosage is low_ so if need be_ I can have it increased should the need arise.  I throw a few from time to time_ but my doctor said this is to be expected.  Also recently I learned of a few other little health problems that may be adding to the Afib thing_ so all and all I'm satisfied with the drug's performance.,F,60,3  years50mg 2X D,9/30/2014,Tambocor
5, 3, A fib,Very tired_ blurred vision_ weight gain.,I've had two previous ablations 3 1/2 years ago. I was fine without a fib until my family doctor increased my antidepressant_ Celexa to 60 mg a day_ which is contraindicated for those with a hx of a fib. I'm currently symptomatic for serve real hours before and after each dose. I will gladly have another ablation to avoid meds the rest of my life!,F,29,40  days100mg 2X D,1/6/2014,Tambocor
6, 5, A-fib / psvt,Moderate fatigue - just means I gotta get to bed earlier and don't do too many late nights.I don't know if this is related_ but my hair seems to be growing faster than ever - now every two weeks I buzz cut it myself with #4 clippers,Two years ago_ had AF episodes every day_ (first thing in morning and arvo/evening)I could work hard/physical all day_ no problem_ as soon as I stopped for lunch or got home_ and especially if I layed down_ then my heart would go NUTS. Did every heart test there is_ and they basically said I have a strong healthy heart with an attitude problemAfter trying other beta blockers with no positive or negative difference_ started 200mg daily flecanide/tambocor _ then up to 350mg daily_ stopped having afib episodes. After a while_ back to 200mg and have been on that ever since.FOR ME flecanide/tambocor has had virtually no side effects_ and has worked perfectly,M,44,18  months100 2X D,11/23/2013Email,Tambocor

Hair loss and eyelash loss_ settled down after approx. 12 months,taken to A&E with fast AF 230bts/min giver Adenosine twice which did not work _ this was one of the worst experiences of my life_ felt like I was dying. Given Tambacor IV _ after 10-20 minutes back in normal sinus rhythm_ was then on 50mg twice daily_ I felt fine _ much better so cut down to 50mg once daily_ ended up in A&E again_ Tambocor given IV and ok again after 10 minutes_ am feeling good but going for an ablation soon so hopefully wont have to take meds for rest of my life.,F,57,36  months50mg 2X D,8/4/2013Email,Tambocor

10, 5, AFib,A loss of energy_ which was taken in conjuntion with other meds (from time to time).  Have worked through that with exercise regime.,Ablation in 2007 helped and two ablations (left and right side) this year as heart tissue grew back causing severe palpatations over a month.  Currently AFib free and without any occurance in the past 4 months_ might be taken off Tambocor all together.  My heart goes out to all fellow suferers.,M,50,14  days100mg 2X D,9/25/2012,Tambocor
11, 4, Afib,Cold hands/feet,Controlled my AF quite well till now. No real side effects apart from  cold hands/feet when I sit for a while in an upright posture...(funny_ I'm ok when laying like a lizard in front of TV)!But lately_ I'm getting short bursts (2 -3 hour stints) of afib back. Not the incredible thumping that used to occur for 24-48 hours_ just an elevated rate (120bpm) that is faint and misses a lot. But if I take an extra tablet_ this stops within an hour.Going to see what the doc thinks about having 3 tabs a day_ or maybe he'll say it's time to visit the electro-cardio specialist.....,M,58,400  days100 2X D,9/16/2012Email,Tambocor
12, 3, AFib,Blurred vision_ ED_ Rapid pulse rate 100 bpm/130bpm but am in sinus rhythm.,Will see Doc tomorrow to re-evaluate meds. I feel Docs should follow protocols and hospitalize AFib patients three days for observation when new meds are prescibed.,M,50,4  days100 2X D,6/5/2012Email,Tambocor

16, 3, Afib_ flutter,"Sad to read that others are suffering_ but reassuring to see the similar side effects.  Tremors and weakness are severe and getting worse.  Hair loss_ memory loss_ speech_ vision and writing/cognitive abilities are deteriorating rapidly to where it is becoming frightening.  Was just sent to a neurologist; wonderful elecrophysician who performed the ablation but denies/atypical that ablation has caused this rapid deterioration.  Also feel very ""lost"" mentally.  Thank you for sharing your experiences-not so alone with these terrible side effects. There is a dramatic change in me-difficult to even write this which is highly unusual for me.",Have had afib and flutter approximately 15 years_ about every 6 months in clusters.  Was kept in balance with 5MG Zebeta/day effectively until 1 year ago.  Cardizam was added_ but frequency increased_ plus very slow heartrate.  Decided on an ablation 4 1/2 months ago which seemingly has worked.  Was put in hospital to initiate 50MG/Tambocor 2xDay for a month previous to ablation; which helped greatly.  Am now on Tambocor approximately 5-6 months but with possible severe problems from it. Doctor just removed it and also 10MG/Day of Lipitor after 10 years.  We shall wait and see. I believe it was a good drug for the arrythmias_ but not certain if it has caused these severe side effects.,F,59,6  months50MG 2X D,1/8/2012Email,Tambocor
17, 1, A-Fib,Blurred vision_ fatigue_ overall not feeling normal in any.,This is a VERY scarey medicine to take. For some this works good_ but I personally could not stand the side effects. I had two instances where I almost went in to A-Fib_ but didn't. My Doctor attributed this to the Flecainide but I don't know. I have now been on Multaq for two months and have been A-Fib free ever since - and zero side-effects.,M,41,30  days100 2X D,5/31/2011,Tambocor
18, 1, A Fib,I've been on 100mg Toporol for 5 years for a fib.  I have a fib once every 12-18 months.  Cardioversion corrects the a fib.  This time the doc put me on 50 mg Toporol and 100mg x2 Tambocor.  I started having very blurred vision and when I layed down my heart would beat twice and skip a beat for hours which caused headaches.  I told my doc no more but he is insisting that I stay on it.  After reading into this med and all the problems there is no way I'm going back to it.,,M,53,2  weeks100 MG 2X D,5/26/2011Email,Tambocor
19, 3, Afib,Feel like I am in a fogg all day.  Out of breath.,I will give this a chance as doctors differ with my diagnosis.  Had an ablation in 2001 for SVT and new doctor thinks it's related.  I would have another ablation in a minute to get rid of the side effects.  Also taking 100 mg. of Toprol succinate and may have to reduce that to increase stamina.,F,65,5  days100 MG 2X D,4/27/2011,Tambocor

23, 3, PSVT,Fatigue is horrible.  Hair loss.  Hot flashes and mood swings.,I have had a heart ablation and it did not work.  I go again in January 2011 to discuss having another one.  My cardiologist says that sometimes you have to have 2 to 3 before one will work.  I know my pharmacist wants me off this drug.  He said long term use can be dangerous.  I take toprol XL also.  I still have bouts of arythmias.  They can be very painful at times.  I guess I will see what happens in January.,F,52,2  years100 2X D,11/14/2010Email,Tambocor
24, 4, Arrhythmia,None that I'm aware of.,My cardiologist prescribed Tambocor after I developed a cardiac arrhythmia following a heart attack in my right coronary artery. I also had a pacemaker installed_ (for pacing only_ i.e._ not a defibrilator). I'm unaware of any problems caused by the drug. Early this year my cardiologist quit his practice so I located a new heart doc. My new cardiologist does not like Tambocor at all_ he considers it to be a very dangerous drug and he does not understand why I'm taking it. He said I should be taking an ACE inhibitor_ which he prescribed in August 2010. However_ because I've been taking Tambocor since January 1997 he is afraid to discontinue it unless I'm admitted to a hospital as an in-patient for at least five days to monitor my heart while I discontinue taking the drug. It seems that I'm now between a rock and a hard place.,M,67,13  years50 MG 3X D,10/15/2010,Tambocor
25, 3, Premature atrial beats_,After a few weeks_ progressive tremors of one hand & forearm_  interfering w/ driving. At 3 months_ 2 days w/ leg tremors. Dose reduced to 25 mg 2x/day for 2 weeks w/ decrease of tremor amplitude but increased frequency. Off pills 2 weeks_ reducing amplitude but no change in frequency. Another post on this site says it took months for side effects to subside.  Cardiologist says this med doesn't cause tremors_ but Primary Dr. says this looks like likely cause_ in my case.,Beta blockers had increased excess beats_ but Flecainide (Tambocor) controlled them to normal level.,F,60,3  months50mg 2X D,8/1/2010,Tambocor
26, 3, Arrhythmia_ Tachycardia,Moderate increase in fatigue_ significant increase in sweating with activity. Initial nausea/worsening GERD that decreased with time.,I've only been on this medication for 2 weeks. It's dampened the sensations/awareness of arrhythmia but not taken it away. I am concerned about the additional fatigue.,F,41,2  weeks50 mg 2X D,7/26/2010Email,Tambocor
27, 1, atrial fibrillation,SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST - LOOK IT UP!,"I was told that this drug was ""bad"" if you have blockages so it was started in a hospital July '08 after they did a stress test and determined I was fine. In Jan '10 I experienced SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST and fortunately was revived after 15 minutes in the woods. Nobody expected me to live. At the hospital they did an angiogram and found 4 blocked coronary arteries. After quadruple bypass I'm now on Multaq. I recommend the book ""Deadly Medicine"" by Thomas Moore_ if you can find it.

29, 1, ,Extreme trembling in right arm and hand that got worse the longer I took the drug.  Vision problems.  Memory loss.  Worst problems were the tremors as they extended to other arm_ knees_ and feet.,Took drug for about 1 year.  Stopped it.  Took several months for side effects to go away.  Started me back on it. Tremors started immediately and very strong.  Pay very close attention to yourself if you start this drug and notice changes.  It was a bad drug for me.,F,60,365  days100mg 2X D,4/13/2010,Tambocor
30, 3, Afib_ SVTs,This drug stole my energy and my personality.  My edge was gone.  I was chronically fatigued_ foggy_ with anxiety and depression.  Everything was a chore.  Not  much was fun.,"I was treated for Afib with an electrical cardioversion.  When I woke  up_ I had a regular beat_ then SVTs_ regular_ then SVTs.  I was put on Tambocor.  It did a pretty good job of controlling the irregular rhythm_ although I would have occasional SVT episodes for up to a minute.  In two years_ I had three more episodes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter_and each time I was treated with a cardioversion which restored the ""normal"" rhythm of regular beat_ then SVT.  I resisted the ablation for atrial fibrillation (left side ablation) because of the highly elevated stroke risk.  Eventually_ with urging from me_ my cardiologists suggested that the real problem might be SVTs_ not afib_ and that the SVTs might be causing the Afib or flutter.  Three weeks ago_ I had an ablation for SVTs(right side_ no highly elevated stroke risk).  The SVT ablation worked wonderfully.  No more SVTs_ and so far_ no afib or flutter.  Stopped taking Tambocor nearly a month ago_ and I could not be happier.  My personality is back_ for better or worse.  I am not taking any medicine at all.  Only by stopping the Tambocor did I realize what a nasty medicine it is and just how much it cost me as a person.  If my cardiologists had put me in the SVT box_ not the Afib box_ much earlier_ I would have had the SVT ablation much sooner and not lost myself for more than 2 years.",M,62,2.5  years100mg 2X D,2/21/2010,Tambocor
31, 5, Afib,Having a little trouble with close-up reading but not a big problem. Could also just be time to get reading glasses.

And my hair loss hasn't slowed down at all.  Although my cardiologist assured me that Tambocor wouldn't cause hair loss_ I discovered that indeed it can cause hair loss in a small percentage of patients.

Even then_ I continued to have the pvc's and 4 episodes of svt_ but they were not as strong. I could deal with most of the side effects except the tremmors_ which were not constant_ but very strong when they did happen.  The tremmors became progressively worse as I continued to take the medication to the point where one day I couldn't even hold a glass of water without spilling most of it.  I have gone for 2 ablations without success because my pvc's usually stop when I'm lying down.  I'm very frustrated_ but still looking for answers.,F,35,3  months,10/2/2008,Tambocor

43, 4, SVTs,No significant side effects noted until I stopped taking it--maybe some mild hair loss and irritated stomach.  You do have to be careful when having a dental procedure requiring anesthesia.  I seemed to develop tinnitus_ pressure in the sinus area_ low-grade headache_ and mild dizziness more so when I discontinued taking Tambocor.  Of course_ more premature heartbeats once I went off of it too.  I'm going to undergo an ablation_ which is why I went off of Tambocor (can't take it for a few days leading up to the ablation).  I felt the medication did a great job of controlling the SVTs_ but I just don't want to take it the rest of my life.,If your doctor suggests taking Tambocor_ give it a try.

Experienced no real side effects for ages but now I am experiencing dizziness_ headaches_ a tight feeling around my head and feeling of pressure_ plus I developed tinnitus in my ears about 3 years ago which I'm sure is a side effect_ even though my doctor says not. My alternative is to have ablation on the extra electrical pathway in my heart_ but havn't plucked up courage to have this yet_ but I really don't want to be on this drug for the rest of my life_ even though it has been great in stopping my attacks_ I really feel prolonged use does cause side-effects.,I wonder if anyone else has experienced ringing in the ears or any of my other symptoms?,F,52,6  days,2/7/2008Email,Tambocor

I do not feel alert but foggy and out of sorts.,It does keep me in rhythm but dislike all the side effects.  I am going to ask my doctor to try something else.  I used to be on Amioderone but ceased due to similar side effects.,M,57,3  weeks,3/29/2007Email,Tambocor
52, 2, pvc's and vtach,Intense headaches every time I took a pill_ and I never get headaches.  Seems like it reduced the sensation of the palpitations but I still felt lightheaded and faint.,,F,44,21  days,3/20/2007,Tambocor
53, 5, Lone AF,Makes me a little tired_ but manageable.  Nothing else.,It really works well to control Afib.  I was reluctant to go on this drug_ but--bottom line--it really works.,M,50,2  years,3/8/2007,Tambocor

55, 1, Atrial Fibrillation after RF Ablati,Approximately 2 hours after being given three (3) tablets orally while in a recovery area following an RF Ablation Procedure_ and experiencing Atrial Fibrillation (procedure didn't fix it)_ I experienced a 23 second cardiac arrest.  My heart restarted in sinus rhythm on its own.  Noone told me there was any danger in taking the drug.  I'll never take it again.,,M,73,1  days,8/14/2005Email,Tambocor
56, 1, ARRHYTHMIA,Head Tremors_ more forceful arrhythmias_ and lack of energy.,Just wondered if anyone has noticed any head tremors after taking Flecanide (Tambocor).  I have jerky head movements from the base of my neck.  I never had it before starting the medication for PAT.  I have gone through several brain MRIs and they show nothing that could cause the tremors. My arrhythmia seems worse after changing from Inderal_ that I had been on for 25 years_ to Flecanide along with Veramapil. The more forceful irregular heart beat interferes with my sleep_ and I am tired all the time.,F,59,18  months,6/28/2005Email,Tambocor
