1, 1, Anxiety,Clonazepam ruined my mother's life and absolutely cause dementia and Alzheimer's she is off it in as a new person but the damage it has done I could kill her doctor for what she has done telling me that 10 a day was just fine if that's what she needs to go to sleep I knew she was taking too many I asked about it all the time finally psychotic was led to the hospital where is psychiatrist said your mother has dementia caused by clonazepam.

2, 1, Chronic anxiety disorder,Yes_ this medication works. It works very well for chronic anxiety disorder and  sudden onsets of severe panic attacks. Knowing what I know now_ I wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me_ and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed. I'm 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical_ emotional_ and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is.,This_ again_ has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. All skin_ especially the face_ becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated_ frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you're an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you_ but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months_ maybe more. That's right. Not just some one week hump to overcome. After finding how awful the withdrawal is I've been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero_ hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I'm now at 2- 1mg doses per day and I'm not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I've had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder_ but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don't seem to be any good alternatives. It's a long road ahead_ please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug. The truth is that most of us ac,F,32,10  years6 mg/ day,6/10/2016Email,Clonazepam

I keep thinking my mom is in the other room but she has been gone almost 20 years. Woke up this morning wasn't sure where I was. I'm really scared of this med now but dr said to stay on it. Never understood when people said they felt like zombies but that is what I feel. I also have the feeling I can take more_ didn't have that when I took xanax.

6, 5, Depression and Anxiety,None,I am so thankful that I listened to my MD to take this in tandem with Mirtazapine (Rememron).  I have had ZERO side effects and I'm not burning in benzo hell as some would have you believe.  It relaxes me for sleeping and works very well for deep anxiety.  Make sure you give it time.

7, 5, anxiety,for a benzo it has very little to no side effects. was used to remove me from Xanax. I noticed no transition switching cold turkey and actually felt better.,Klonopin is a great benzo having taken several that had terrible side effects. it is a very mild drug and really works so well you don't notice it.

8, 4, Neck Tremor,Mostly off-balance feeling when I first started along with joint aches.,After months of taking it I don't have any side effects_ It does reduce my neck tremor so I'm happy with the medication. It doesn't work 100 percent but its close. If I don't take the medication for a few days to take a break from it I will then feel  dizzy or like I'm off balance when walking along with a heavy spacy head.

10, 3, Anxiety and unable to sleep,Tired_ no energy_ headache and itching and headache at higher dose_ skin stings as in hurts like aches and pains in the body sometimes_ and horrible cold and hot sweats also hard to eat at times like a full feeling_ UTI that I have never had and lots of ear infections and memory issues most of the side effects started the longer I was on it. It also no longer helps me sleep unless I go way up and sorry i'm just not doing that. If you don't have to take these drugs for something very serious then I would subject not talking them at all as it can and it will eventually ruin you life.,At first this worked great and I was very relaxed_ and was able to sleep like a baby however_ I slowly started to feel like I didn't want to do anything but stay home and started to neglect the things I needed to accomplish during the day. I wish I never started it as this drug creeps up on your system very slow and before you realize it if you do at all that is as it kind of gives you a I don't give a care feeling. I took myself down off of it slowly as I was put on it 3 times a day at .05 and then I went down on it to 10 with in 6 months as I stated to see thanks to my kids that I had no energy at all and no desire to do anything. so stayed on this for a long time then in the last year have gone up and down on it for 10 to .05 and now staying at .05 and doing my best to get off of it!!

23, 4, anxiety,At first_ I did not experience any side effects that I knew of. I had not read about the side effects. I have inherited arthritis and I've had two back surgeries on my lower back. My knees often hurt and occasionally my ankles but I credited all off that to getting older. Boy_ was I wrong. I just had a good friend die recently_ I am in the process of selling things and getting ready to move_ and I'm doing a lot of work which hurts my back_ plus I have allergies.I was taking a couple more pills than I should have because of the stress_but when I was taking it before it seemed pretty mild. It is not! It took me about 3 days to figure out why I was walking like a 95 year old woman_ My ankles hurt severely_ and my entire body had aches and pains. Then I looked up the side effects for the very first time. I could not believe it. I suffered from every single side effect. I cut down my dose immediately_ and already the next day half of the pain was gone.I am almost hopeful that my back is going to start feeling better_ because after two surgeries it still gave me problems. Side effects include muscle aches and joint pain. As soon as I taper off_ I will never take this again.,,F,58,1  years.05 x 3,5/6/2015,Clonazepam

31, 2, Anxiety,I have been having panic attacks_ social anxiety_ and hypochondria for several years. Was on Lexapro and Alprazolam for breakthrough anxiety. I gained 30 lbs on the Lexapro although it worked well so I decided to come off of it and I've already lost 7lbs in about 2 weeks. Anyway_ Dr prescribed Clonozepam since it supposedly lasts longer than Alprazolam. I took it and felt nothing unusual but it did not even touch my anxiety. After two hours_ I started flushing_ sweating_ and throwing up. I could not sleep that night and when I finally did fall asleep around 7:30am_ I had hellish nightmares and kept waking up. The entire next day I felt like I had a bad hangover and a headache that wouldn't quit. I do not recommend this medicine.

I did have occasional panic and insomnia.  After many years_ I began having problems passing urine.  With a quick search_ Clonazepam came up.  I am using catheters_ getting infection after infection_ and am trying to get off the drug.  I have researched the Ashton Manuel_ and am trying the Valium crossover.  It's been a nightmare_ and I haven't even completed the crossover!  Please_ stay away from Benzodiazepines!  I'm a medical professional_ and didn't do my homework.

35, 1, anxiety,was on 4mg per day which didn't help me that much but affected my cognitive abilities which i wasn't aware of until told by others_ slurred speech_ seemed drunk_ driving badly_ not able to function well ie looking after myself_ cleaning up etc. Like a zombie.,Tapering off 10% per week as per doctors instructions and Ashton Manual(online)  Went from 4mg to 1mg with very stong but bearable alternating withdrawal symptoms including_ being totally wiped out-sleeping 16hrs_ slight panic attacks/adrenalin rushes_ very high anxiety_ dilated pupils_ itchy skin_ sweating_ unable to remember dates/mixing up appointments etc. Very wound up and uncomfortable but with times of feeling ok so i was able to reduce the dosage. I got to around 1mg then i got hit with symptoms so unbearable that i have stopped at this dose_ i felt like i had decended into hell; depression_ burning skin(when starting to sweat)_ feelings of terror_ feelings of helplessness_ not wanting to get out of bed_ difficulty doing every day tasks_ suicidal idealation (would rather be dead at times).  Knowing it is only going to get worse for months makes it all worse.  Feeling trapped.  I would not have taken this medicine if i knew that the withdrawal symptoms would be worse than the anxiety it was supposed to control.  Everyone is different some people have no withdrawal symptoms and use it for years but this how it has affected me.  Will be seeing doctor on weekly basis and try to work something out.,M,36,1.5  years1mg 1X D,5/19/2014Email,Clonazepam
36, 5, Anxiety_ PTSD_ Insomnia,I've not experienced any negative side effects while taking the drug it is difficult to stop taking,Clonazepam has essentially cured my insomnia (along with trazodone)and has made dealing with PTSD and anxiety a lot easier.  I took .5 mg 1x a day for about 2 yrs (took 1 extra per day during extreme times)then about a year ago I lowered the dose to .25 mg 1x per day with no problem.  My new doctor wants to get me off the clonazepam and she suggested I take the pill only every other day but so far that has not been doable for me_ I don't sleep w/o it and the next day I can't really function. The clonazepam also helps with pain associated with a herniated disc in my neck and loss of disc in spine_ I do not take any other drugs for pain nor anything else.,F,57,3  years.25 mg 1X D,3/26/2014,Clonazepam

38, 2, Myoclonic Jerks,Drowziness_ depression_ trouble with sleeping_ problems with co-ordination_ memory loss_ 'brain fog'_ confusion_ poor attention_ DEPENDENCE,I have Clonazepam at such as high dose because I have a rare Neurological Movement disorder called 'Myoclonic-Dystonia'. Sure_ Clonazepam alleviates the twitching and muscle spasms... until I get more tolerance and have to take more. Started taking Clonazepam about a year and a half ago- initially I  started on 2 mg a day :/ If anybody is offered this drug should really question it_ especially it is being indicated for long-term use. I didn't question enough and now I have such a strong dependence and ever increasing tolerance_ there are plans to up me to the max dose (20 mg). This drug has made me an addict_ I sometimes try to try to take less but the withdrawal is HELL.

39, 4, Panic/anxiety/depression/bipolar 2,None really,Clonazepam works for my panic attacks/anxiety and helps me to sleep. If I lose sleep I become hypomanic. I have had GAD since I was a child and am now 71 years old. I stopped drinking alcohol 24 years ago_ since it was not a medication_ and it only made my mental disorder worse.  I can't take any antidepressants beyond beginning doses because they induce hypomania.So I take the clonazepam  when I have episodes that bring me extreme panic or anxiety_ or when my insomnia gets worse.Typically I take between three quarters and one and a half milligrams at night only for sleep.When my panic or anxiety kicks up because of situational things_ I am increased to a total of 2 1/2 mg per day.  At present I am on that protocol. It has been the first time in almost 5 years that I have needed to take regular clonazepam  during the day to break up the anxiety_ panic part of my disorder.  While I don't like taking it_ it is the only thing that helps me. If I tried to cut back to soon the episode only gets worse.Normally_ I take only the bedtime dose. From time to time the psychiatrist is in support of my tapering_ which I have to do very slowly. Then I may get down to 1 mg at night for several months.Many people here talk about the severe withdrawal reactions. In my case the doctor and I both agree_ that when I get down too low_ it is not withdrawal_ but my primary bipolar to that kicks in _ which includes panic anxiety insomnia and depression.Right now_ I seem to have episode,F,,16  years1-1&1?2 1X D,1/22/2014Email,Clonazepam

42, 1, Dystonic cerebral palsy,insomnia_ depression_ anxiety_ suicidal thoughts,I was first prescribed this when i was about 16_ so then i thought it was a wonder drug because it controlled my tremors and muscle tightness...at least i thought.  What it really did was put me in such a fog that i didn't notice my tremors.  After about a year we raised the dosage from twice_ to three times a day. That's when all hell broke loose with the side effects.  I strongly urge you to try different alternatives and really do some research on this drug before making the decision to take it.,M,18,2  years1 MG 3X D,12/17/2013,Clonazepam
43, 1, For anxiety,rage_ derealization_ depersonalization_ suicidal thoughts and urges_ depression,Within an hour or less of taking this drug I would get extremely depressed and lethargic to the point my husband had to help feed and bathe me. I started having rages FOR NO REASON out of nowhere and then suicidal thoughts and even urges_ again for no reason. This drug as well as others in its class (benzodiazepines) should be limited to short-term (2-4 week) use. Beyond that_ the user could develop a tolerance where more of the drug is needed to reduce anxiety/insomnia. Users also get interdose withdrawal from the drug and feel the need to take more of the drug before the next dose to calm down. Before you know it_ your brain is dependent on it. Withdrawals from this drug are Hellish and last longer (YEARS in some cases) than withdrawal than from street drugs. Cold turkey withdrawal from this drug made all the above side effects much worse and I'm still healing from its effects 18 months later.,F,36,10  weeks0.125 3X D,4/8/2013,Clonazepam

It doesn't last for long though_ it goes away and you begin to just feel calm_ maybe a bit drowsy still.,It definitely helps when I'm feeling the onset of major anxiety or a panic attack and I need help calming myself down. It's not a cure_ I use it along with therapy and tools to help myself relieve my anxiety and panic.

48, 5, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Sleepy_ clumsy_ slight headaches_ euphoria.,I have never had serious anxiety issues until about seven months ago. For whatever reason my anxiety steadily increased to the point where I had this incredible daily fear that I had something physically wrong and I was dying. I never used to go to the doctor for anything (years i didn't go to the doctor) and suddenly I was calling every week to set up an appointment with an ailment I was sure was life threatening. I convinced my doctor to give me a referral to a cardiologist because of personal fears that something was going on with my heart. I met with an endocronologist over fears that my glands were not functioning correctly and I had an inbalance. I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack_ and I had two seperate severe panic attacks. I had numerous blood tests. 2 EKG's_ an echocardiogram_ chest x-rays for lung cancer. I honestly had fears that I had cancer_ an irregular heart beat_ liver failure_ kidney failure_ bone cancer_ deep vein thrombosis_ pancreatitis_ diabetes_ irritable bowel syndrome_ and the list goes on and on. All completely ridiculous_ but my fear was completely real and I couldn't escape it.After finally realizing these daily fears and my constant anxiety wasn't rational or normal I attempted to control it through diet_ excercise and meditation. Months of failed attempts to make anything better I finally set-up another appointment with my doctor to discuss my anxiety issues.

I had no idea how my life was going to change_ for the worst. The detox center had me go cold turkey and so three days later all hell broke loose. When i say all hell_ I literally mean it. The next 2yrs were pure HELL. I was in and out of hopitals the situation got so bad_ I had rather someone take my legs off as long as I was better. I am traumatized from the hell I had to live. Till this day when I talk about I still cry like a baby. So plz if u decide to come off any benzos_ do it in a way that u feel comfortable. First talk to ur Dr. and make sure its done very slowly.

It is a life-saver.,This medicine is a mini miracle for me. I have had no problems with it at all. I know some are complaining about withdrawal symptoms but_from what I have heard that only happens to people who take higher dosages. I have never really experienced any of that. I have abruptly stopped medications with no problems. ( I know you shouldn't do that and don't recommend anyone else do it. I was young then lol.),F,22,2  months1/2 mg 1X D,4/24/2012,Clonazepam
