1, 1, Antidepressant_ sleep,Trazodone (50 mg.) - I took half a tablet (25 mg.) and it caused Cervical Dystonia within a few minutes.  It also caused nausea_ tiredness and some slight dizziness.  I felt some indigestion as well.  My breathing felt a little weird as well.  This might be due to the anticholinerginic properties of it.,[Note:  I only took it one time and stopped it].

2, 1, Insomnia,,I loved this medication for the longest time --but this was before I made the connection to all of these side effects:1. Weight gain (gained 50 pounds over the year I was taking it. Have lost 30 in the last 6 months of being off of it!)  2. CHRONIC constipation. (I was considering getting a colonoscopy to check for cancer --I'm only 25)  3. Swelling/Water retention (my sister -who is a nurse- used to say I looked as puffy as her edema patients)I cannot believe how long it took me to connect these symptoms with this medication but I feel like a new person since stopping it.,F,25,1  years150 MG 1X D,2/7/2011Email,Trazodone hydrochloride
