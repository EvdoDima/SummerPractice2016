0, 4, Back Spasams,Sleepy_ shakiness_ forgetful_ withdrawals_ blurred vision_ not a care in the world,If been taking somas for 10 years after a car accident. Started out fine taking 1 to 2 pills as needed then it became recreational and I built up a tolerance then I loved the feeling made me feel drunk then I started to drink alchohol with them when I couldn't feel the feeling. Ended up in the hospital numerous times got in trouble with the law. I got 2 DUIs. Needless to say I'm addicted to them. Lost jobs lost friends. I would not recommend them if you have a addicted perssonality. Best sleep I've ever had. P,M,40,10  years350 MG,7/28/2016Email,Soma

3, 5, Severe neck back spasms,Fatigue_ definitely wouldn't drive anywhere after having taken one. It basically helped if I put some mineral ice on laid on the heating pad and then took one.,This is one of the best working relaxers that I have taken_ and taking numerous ones that have not helped at all. I've had two fingers that were numb on my left hand for 2 months I took this muscle relaxer for 3 Days made me and my feeling came back and my two fingers. It really works. Another time I had a spasm in my shoulder blade at 3 a.m. _ I was crying and in excruciating pain_ I took one put some mineral ice on_ and laid on a heating pad and after two cycles of that it was completely gone and I felt better.,F,45,1  years350 mg 2X D,4/21/2016,Soma

7, 4, Herniated Discs and spasms,Blurred vision_ Drunk feeling_ sleepy,I've taken Soma 350 for almost 3 Yeats now for my back pain_ I take 4 only at bedtime as I have 5 young children and I obviously don't wanna be in a stuper while taking care if them. So I only take then when I crawl into bed. I fall asleep in about 45 minutes and get a great nights sleep. I wake up feeling great and take my tramadol in the morning to help with my pain. I don't see how anyone could operate on this medication. Best used at bedtime. Also I stopped this for 9 months why I was pregnant_ no withdraw.... Really Helps Me!!!,F,32,3  years350,12/20/2015Email,Soma
8, 1, Herniated discs_ spondylolesthesis,Absolutely the worst effects trying to get off gradually. My back and legs are cramping and my mind is mush_ can't remember anything.  My doctor says they are hugely addictive. I always took as prescribed and felt fine_ but has been hell coming off,Soma should only be given to to three weeks for treatment. The longer you have taken_ the harder to get off. Wish someone had waned me. My doc thank Doc is tapering me off gradually_ but I still feel wretched. Get off slowly as soon as you can. My nerves are on edge and I'm useless at home_ walking dogs and keeping up house is impossible. So glad I'm retired and don't have children to care for. Please take heed from me_ it is no party feeling like this. Stay away from Soma. You all are feeling so good because narcotics along with soma turn into meprobamates in your brain (similar to heroin). That is why you feel so great on them. My doc believes the FDA is cracking down on prescribing the drug and they can shut down soma manufacturing and none of you will have it to take. Again_ get off ASAP_ sooner the better_ do it very slowly!!!!,F,63,15  years350 4X D,11/8/2015,Soma
9, 5, Leg Cramps/Pain,Sleepiness,I began taking Zanaflex_ but had to switch to Soma due to the headaches they caused. These are my miracle drug and help my morning leg stiffness as well as my cramping at night. They make me sleepy if I take them on an empty stomach.

11, 5, fractured T-7_T-8_ T-9. Musclespasm,drowsiness_ weight gain. tiredness during the day. some headache.,"I'm in med school right now and have taken pharmacology one and two. I know what the potential of this drug is along with many other drugs. All drugs have side effects. Does the benefits outweigh the side effects is the ultimate question you have to ask yourself. It's a individual thing.  Yes_ this drug will make you feel dizzy_ Yes_ it will make you sleepy. Yes_ you can overdose on it_ just like every other drug made. But it is up to YOU to put the drugs into your mouth and swallow them. Yes_ if you take a handful at a time you probably will be sedated for a long period of time. It does not ""relax"" the muscles required for breath. Those are not the muscles it targets. Many that do ""OD"" on this drug_ actually are taking other meds with them like pain meds_ or other CNS depressants. The fastest way to put your life in danger is taking a bunch of pills that should not be taken together or abusing the ones that you are prescribed. I had a hard time sleeping (falling asleep_ staying asleep) Instead of taking addictive sleep meds_ I asked my doc for soma. I take 3_ sometimes 4 at bedtime_ and have been doing so for around 2 years. I sleep. I don't always take that many. sometimes I take 1 or even half. Sorry for the people that lost loved ones to this drug. You can kill yourself with asprin_ tylenol. and alot of other OTC drugs. This drug is not for everyone. Your body chemistry is not all alike. Just take it as needed and prescribed.",M,46,2  years350x3-4 1X D,7/4/2015Email,Soma

20, 1, pain/muscle relaxation,Ever heard of Soma Coma? That's what it does. I used to have an Indian Dr (most don't like opiates) who prescribed me 2 350mg tablets 4 times a day! In the 1950's and 60's this drug was used as a Tranquilizer! Soma has NO muscle relaxing properties. ***USE WITH CAUTION*** especially when combined with CNS depressants.* Subject to abuse_ dependence_ withdrawal and misuse. There is a risk of overdose which may lead to death_  hypotension_ seizures and other health issues. withdrawal symptoms included insomnia_ vomiting_ abdominal cramps_ headache_ tremors_ muscle twitching_ ataxia_ hallucinations_ and psychosis. One of Soma's metabolites_ meprobamate_ (a controlled substance)_ may also cause dependence. *http://www.drugs.com/pro/carisoprodol.html#S2Feel free to contact me with Pain related questions or other issues.Mr. Robert N.

21, 5, muscle spasms_ pain,Occasionally Soma will make me loopy but not every time. If I take it after I've eaten it won't do that to me at all. Very rarely I have had a loss of balance_ maybe 3 times since I started taking it.,I take Soma in addition to Oxycodone and they work WONDERFULLY together for my pain that is caused by arthritis in my spine. This combination actually enables me to function and carry on my responsibilities as a mother of 3 young children_ instead of lying in bed with a heating pad all day and crying from the pain I'm in.

23, 2, SpasmsContractions-NervePain-Damage,Vertigo_ not for hypotension patience_ vomiting_ nausea_ stoned_ drunken spins_ severe constipation_ Fainting_ tachycardia_ no nerve pain_ no severe spasms_ my completely unmanageable pain is gone. I halved my pills same side effects- symptoms. I am trying a fourth now and will see if that works. It's been 30 minutes feel high and it also give anxiety. Hopefully I can adjust as my options for meds are so limited. DO not suggest anyone with low blood pressure take this. I had to puke and put on compression stockings as well as take other BP meds to raise my BP and stop the spins then passed out for 12 hours. At a full dose I worry that I could be in a coma. Couldn't imagine anyone wanting to abuse this as the side effects are awful enough. Dehydration and headaches also occur.,I am hoping this is an adjustment period but will be calling my doctor asap as he suggested. I do not suggest taking with any other sedative/ pain medicine/ almost went to the ER... I do feel out breath a little at a fourth dose.  (this is jst 1/4th of a 350mg pill) Please be careful with this drug. I love reality too so only hope to take this as a last resort if I don't stop all together because I feel completely like I smoked pot in space and not connected with the world around me and not in a good way. I ate with this dose and have been drinking glasses of water. Taking midodrine to raise BP.,F,26,7  days350 2X D,3/24/2014Email,Soma
24, 5, Motorcycle Accident 24 fractures,Tired in the morning,I have posted before about my motorcycle accident. Had 24 fractures and head injury. A year or so later the doc gave me Soma. That was the first good nights sleep I had since my accident. If only people wouldn't take it like skittles__ makes it hard on people that need it for real pain. Keep it down_ it will still work_ you just don't get that nice Soma hug. I was Rx'd 4 a day_ never took more than 3. Over the last 6 months I have cut back to 350 an hour before dinner. Then I take a one at night. It still works after all these years. I bump it with melatonin supplement sometimes. I try not to a lot. It greatly enhances a night with less pain___ gets you through the night. I only take Lortab (2) during the day. It seems like I wake up in a few hours if I take Lortab at night. Don't give in to that 3 or 4 or 40 at a time. Is that a road you want to go down? It's a Barbituate and very addicting_ I know..You will have to pay the piper if you get cut off. So would I at 2 a day. Do yourself a favor and take it only when you need it because your hurting so bad. It will ease your suffering.Funny thing about Soma is that it's a nerve blocker. It blocks the pain signal from getting to your brain. It still hurts but you don't know it. I have had a toothache. Been to the dentist twice. I notice when I take a Soma the toothache goes away. It comes back in a few hours but not as bad. It's a good drug.,M,60,12  years350 2X D,12/6/2013Email,Soma

32, 5, Pain and Help Sleep,I think it has taken my desire to do things away.,Broke 24 bones in motorcycle accident_ collapsed lung_ closed head injury_ fractured pelvis and scapula. I had never heard of Soma. My GP thought Flexeril was making me depressed and wanted me to try Soma. He was writing 4x a day with 11 refills for years. I never took 4 a day_ at one point I was taking 3 a day. Have cut back to 1/2 of a pill early evening and one around 10-11 pm with no problem. This last 1-1/2 is going to be rough to get off. My back was broken and neck injuries make it so I have to sleep on my stomach. Soma takes pain away like nothing else I have tried. I take 2 Lortab during the day but it hardly touches the pain. I don't drive on Soma_ don't feel it is safe because it does make you loopy on one pill. Now after 11 years I feel like I need to stop taking it. I didn't know that a good portion of it metabolizes into metrobromate_ a barbituate that makes it hard to stop.I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard spot. I want to get off it but I keep taking it due to my dislike for pain and enjoying 8-9 hours of sleep. After I take the night one I stay up for hours because it is the first time of the day I am pain free. It is definitely a double edged sword. I don't know if it makes you sick to stop completely_ I have never tried. The pain keeps me coming back every night_ even though I am completely unmotivated. I feel like Soma is robbing me of a life. I am content to watch tv all day_ every day. Maybe from the wreck_ or my age but in my heart I know it',M,60,11  years350 2X D,3/17/2013,Soma
33, 4, Knee muscle spasms,Sleepiness_ loopiness_ nauseau,It helped the muscle spasms stop. and i don't feel like i will develop an addiction_ i'm also on pain meds_ a really low dose for my knee(i've had 3 knee surgeries) and it really is helping me. i would not recommend taking this drug for a long time because it is meant for a 3 week period at most. i would recommend only to those who honestly need some pain relief from an injury. Not for 'recreational use',F,23, 350 mg 4X D,2/22/2013Email,Soma
34, 5, arthritis stiffness and pain,a little constipated and sleepy if I wasn't doing something.,Worked very well.

This is the only medication that actually REACHED my pain and dealt with it well.   I have no side effects_ and have been taking Soma for 7 YEARS....AND THE SOMA STILL WORKS WELL.  I'VE BEEN ON THE SAME DOSAGE for 7 years!!   Still works well. Have not changed the dosage or frequency.   I Pray someone out there will support NOT TAKING SOMA OFF THE MARKET IN THE U.S.  It certainly does much more good than not.

40, 5, Fibromyalgia,I have no side affects from this drug.,I have had fibromyalgia for over 16 years. It is a miserable disease and the only thing that has even eased my pain is SOMA. I had no adverse reactions from it and was actually able to sleep. If this med is taken as prescribed and for what it is needed_ then there should be no problem in taking this drug. As far as addiction_ I don't believe it and I will tell you why. I was on this drug for about five years and I then moved. Once I had new doctors_ they refused to perscribe it to me and I was shut off cold turkey and has no reaction. They have no chosen that I see a pain specialist for my pain and they all have no problem prescribing me narcotics and opioids which are so addicting that I can't understand what is happening here. I hate them_ I feel like crap taking most of them and they just don't work after a while. I have to take doses that are strong enough to knock a horse over to get any relief because my body has gotten use to them. I wish people would fight more for SOMA as it is one of the BEST meds out there. I am sorry for the few that I have read that lost someone to soma but it makes me wonder if they were taking way more than they were prescribed? These people that have a hell of a lot of nerve to come on here and think it is funny to write about you high experiences should be shot! This isn't the purpose for this medical rating.

45, 4, fibro,Some sleepiness_ nothing a cup of coffe couldn't cure for a bit. I can take with or without food. I do not drive however within 30 minutes of taking any dose_ after 30 minutes any lightheadedness subsides and I'm good,In conjunction with my Lyrica_ it has helped me function with only dull pain (most of the time)_ by keeping me loose and directly addressing my pain. I have been hurting excessively and these two drugs have helped me make a huge turnaround. I don't always take all 3 and sometimes I split the first one in half and take those halves as dose 1 and 2...but sometimes the breakthrough pain is simply unbearable. also helps me sleep at night because I can relax_ which can be hard to do when you hurt! I am so sorry to the people who have lost loved ones because of this med_ but I have also lost people to substances which were addictive_ and abused_ because they were adicts. choose to treat the addiction and the pain and try to always choose moderation. this med has saved me and I would fight the *&%#! who would have me suffer like I was before! I have kids and an elderly parent to look after. I have a job_ bills to pay_ and serious obligations to fulfil.I would lose all that_ which is literally my life. depriving me of that is very similar to actually killing me_ except that would be better_ because me family would get my life insurance pay-out; otherwise I am a drain on everyone_ even society.,F,36,30  days250mg 3X D,12/28/2011,Soma
46, 5, Right Lateral Thoracotomy w/ T6 Fus,Metallic taste in my mouth after 20-30min. NO BUZZING,What people rarely know about this medication is that a schedule II anxiety medication is a metabolite of Soma.  If you were to have a blood pharmacology done_ you would find that Meprabomate reveals itself at as much as 7 times the amount of the actual Soma. Also_ if you have been taking it as long as I have_ you may also find that your body isn't metabolizing it as it used to. I take this as prescribed and do not have a problem with it. But in researching it I find that many people abuse it. I guess you might say it's like what you hear about those who do hardcore drugs and get that overwhelming euphoria the first time. Then they continue looking for that same result but cannot find it again. So they do more and more and more. Eventually they wind up either jailed_ or it's always their first priority to obtain and take. If you are prescribed this medication (and it better be for a darn good reason [pain_ spasm] do exactly what the doctor says.

Drowsiness_ and a slight buzz when taken on an empty stomach.,I like this medication because it does not make me feel dependent_ and having a condition that is usually treated with highly addictive pain medications I try to avoid those at all costs. Unfortunately_ since I have been taking this medication I have been having very intense nightmares. That is my biggest complaint and it makes it hard for me because I have to decide what is more important_ to get to sleep and have nightmares_ or stay awake in pain.

51, 4, Herniated Disc in Neck,Tiredness_ Dizziness,Soma worked very well for the first few months_ then I built up a tolerance.  My muscle spasms would be so bad it would cause my neck to flare up causing severe nerve pain.  Soma would help the muscles relax so the neck pain would not flare up.  I stopped taking this right before my surgery_ and after my surgery my surgeon put me on a different medication.  It wasn't working as well by that time anyway.

If I take one pill before bed I sleep well and wake up with very little pain. However_ during a fibro flare the pain will come back after I'm awake for a couple hours. I don't get any of the ""high"" feeling others describe because it just puts me to sleep. I notice that I can't fall asleep without it anymore_ so I don't know if I'm becoming dependant on it or not_ but I have no desire to take it during the day.",F,37,6  months350MG 1X D,9/12/2011Email,Soma
55, 1, upper back pain,I couldn't walk_ I felt in a cloud for 20 hours_ hallucinated_ will never take it again.This is my experience only.  I take flexeril 10mg 3x daily and I love it!!!  Just body chemistry and genes_ I guess,I flushed all mine down the toilet and glad i did it.  There are only two people i can think of i would want to feel like that_ haha,F,56,1  times350mg 3X D,9/3/2011,Soma
56, 5, Migraines/Daily tension headaches,Slight sleepiness.,"I was prescribed this drug once per day_ at bedtime.  So_ the slight sleepiness it caused me was actually welcomed.  I was taking Flexeril 3X daily to keep me loose during the day.  It was a little hard to function doing that_ but a lot better than debilitating headaches!  I did not find the Soma to cause any ""euphoria"" or ""giddiness"" for me.  It just helped the pain.  had to stop due to pregnancy_ hoping to re-start after weaning baby from the breast.",F,33,2  months250mg 1X D,7/8/2011Email,Soma
57, 5, back surgery,Fell asleep quickly and become light headed if I don't fall asleep,Took after my back surgery and really helped with the combination of perks that I got from the hospital after surgery. For the people with all the negative effects from it make sure you read ALL the side effects so you know what you might be in store for and if you have any call your doctor ASAP. This is a VERY powerful drug with MAJOR side effects and yes it is possible you can die but that is very rare but can happen and it can be VERY addictive so take with caution...this information is not from some normal person I am a RN that works at a hospital. Please don't abuse this drug which most deaths from this drug is because of the toxicity of this drug and mixing it with alcohol which is the worse thing you could do so DON'T DO IT!!! Again it's a good drug to relieve some things but can be very dangerous so take with caution and make sure you know all the possible side effects before taking. Hope this helps.,M,21,2  months350 MG 3X D,5/11/2011,Soma
58, 4, neck sprain,insomnia,"I have noticed that Soma makes most people drowsy and when my husband had to take it_ he was asleep within 20 minutes. It has the opposite effect on me_ I seem to be only able to sleep about 3 hours at a time. It does help relieve the muscle tightness in my neck_ but no feelings of being ""high""_ etc.",F,47,1  weeks350mg 2X D,3/16/2011,Soma
59, 5, ,I experienced no side effects whatsoever _ otherthan a little tiredness on a350 mg dose,I had major pain followingfoot surgery _ mainly on most of my toes ( hammertoe and bunions )on both feet _possibly nerverelated post surgical syndrone and had trieddarvon and fiorinal withlimited success .  I also had60 visits with a PT wheree-stim _ ultrasound _ contrast baths and 830 coldlaser therapy was of some help but disregaurding anypain meds the SOMA seemsto help relax the nerve impulses _ which cause pain_ numbness _ tinglingand lack of focus due to these stimuli .  SOMA seems to block the nerve pain _ atleast after these other treatment modalities have maxed out their progression anyway .  I may possibly have perephial neuritis / neuropathy or compressednerves . At this point in myfollow-up therapy it takesmy mind off my feet and gives me more focus andallows me to be in the gameagain . I can actually hold aconversation without thedistraction of pain _ whichoccured sitting _ standing_walking _ or even sleeping _and my wife doesn't haveto watch me move my feetconstantly while we are justwatching TV and I am onceagain able to feel like more of an asset around the house and more capable atwork . luckily I am a lab technician at a major factoryor I might not have the 33years seniority I have at mystill young age _ and wouldmaybe have to retire !!  I  am thankful for where I amand not remorseful as I once was thanks to someprogress and SOMA to relaxmy neurological symptoms !!!!,M,51,2  days 4X D,2/16/2011,Soma
