0, 1, copd,Rash_ feeling awful,As with all the other inhalers I've tried_ I get an awful rash. Small red dots from head to toe.  Also_ had peeling skin inside my mouth.,M,69,1.5  days1 puff 4X D,2/15/2013,Xopenex
1, 5, Severe asthma for 30 years,shakey hands_ racing heart like with all asthma meds_,It is great to control asthma along with pulmacort and albueterol but not enough by itself to save the day.,F,36,10  years 1X D,2/3/2012Email,Xopenex

3, 3, Asthma,My daughter took this drug to replace albuterol for her asthma. It did not seem to work quite as well as the albuterol. A positive of the xopenex was that it did not make her as hyperactive as the albuterol. But we are just realizing it is causing her to twitch/shiver every hour or two_ so are taking her off of it.,,F,6,2  weeks 3X D,4/17/2010Email,Xopenex
4, 2, Asthma,None,Switched to Xopenex because of the heart racing effect of albuteral.  Unfortunately it didn't work for me so I'm back to the heart racing albuteral.  Which is ok because even though I may feel like I'm jumping out of my skin at times_ I like being able to breath...,F,41,3  months,10/22/2009,Xopenex
5, 3, drug company pushed it on my doctor,increased heart rate.,I wouldn't say xopenex is any different from albuterol.The hype says it is_ but it cost 5 times more.Its soooo typical that a drug company makes a small molecular change just to grab a new patent_ often making bogus claimsof better _ but really no change at all in effectiveness.The only change I see in this is a high price.,M,3, ,10/17/2009,Xopenex
6, 4, Asthma,We have not seen much in the way of side effects (my son uses both Xopenex and Pulmicort).  Perhaps a little more hyperactivity but not very noticable. Increased heart rate is probably one.  It's definitely much better than Albuterol.  My wife thinks our son has had more urinary incontinence after or around treatments.,This definitely seems like a better alternative to Albuterol as my son was on that at a very young age and I remember him shaking after treatments.  That's not the case with Xopenex_ though sometimes in his sleep he seems to twitch more.  My son has been on the Xopenex intermittently_ approximately 2-5 months out of the year he may need several doses before the Pulmicort kicks in.,M,6,5  years,4/4/2009,Xopenex
7, 5, asthma,No side effects,I was forced to switch from my albuterol CFC inhaler to Provetil HFA due to the ban on all CFC containing inhalers. The proventil HFA did not work at all. My doctor gave me xopenex and it works as effectively as my old albuterol CFC inhaler. I'm very satisfied.,F,28,1  months,1/26/2009,Xopenex
8, 3, wheezing with asthma,didnt notice any adverse effects while taking  this inhaler form. it helps with the wheezing that occurs very deep into my lungs. i have not been actually been diagnosed with asthma_ but it wont be long if i keep smoking and using the inhaler.,it cheap. it has been effective until recently when i was having all the physical activity. sometimes you can hear me wheeze all the way across the basement. it sounds like a cat in distress. i am used to this because i have had wheezing for ever. this med seems to work but i am going to try albuterol to see if that works as well.,F,31,4  months,10/6/2008Email,Xopenex
9, 5, a change from Proventil,None whatsoever.,Xopenex works promptly and effectively. I have noticed less heart racing and even aches in my heart when I was on Proventil. I am 57 years old now_ and have had asthma since I was two years old. I think Xopenex is great_ and I have had absolutely NO problem with it!,F,57,1  years,8/16/2008,Xopenex

11, 1, moderate to severe asthma,can't think of any major side effects except bad taste in my mouth.,"I was given this inhaler by my insurance company as a replacement for the supposedly ""discontinued"" Albuterol. (I moved out of state and was able to get my usual albuterol with no problem!)  My first moderate asthma episode_ I grabbed this inhaler and thought it would provide immediate relief_ as albuterol does.  It did not.  I took 2 more puffs_ and my asthma got progressively worse and worse.  Out of desperation and fear (I couldn't breathe and was on the verge of passing out)_ I took another puff.  Still no relief at all!  It is OK to use if you just feel a slight tightening of your lungs and are at the very beginning stages of of an attack.  But otherwise a useless product!  This inhaler also clogs up very easily and you have to prime it 4 or 5 times to get it going_ so it also wastes quite a bit.",F,32,6  months,5/3/2007,Xopenex
12, 1, pneumonia,racing heart_ pounding heart_ could not catch my breath.  I was scared to death. I thought this was to help me breathe and instead I was going downhill fast.  I really feared for my life. As soon as I stopped taking this inhaler_ I started feeling better.,I will not take this inhaler again and have it on my medical card so if I am unconscious_ no one will try to give it to me. The way my heart felt and the way I could not breathe_ I really felt every breath might be my last.,F,65,6  days,3/16/2007,Xopenex
13, 3, asthma,My child was prescribed this med as a replacement for albuterol that made him 'hyper'.  Although better_ it still has some behavioral impact and it is expensive!,,M,7,6  years,12/7/2006,Xopenex
