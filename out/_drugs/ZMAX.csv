0, 1, Sinus infection,Weakness_ dizzyness_ upset stomach_ diarrhea_ in ability to eat_ anxiety_ shaky_ completely out of it.,I thought this medication would be great. You take just one dose and it works for 10 days. However soon after I took it I felt 100 times worse then I had before and had added symptoms. I couldn't get out of bed or eat anything for 3 days. I was shaking when I would walk and felt like I was going to pass out. Everything was spinning on me and my muscles were all sore. After the frist 3 days I slowly started to get better but I didn't feel completely normal untill day 12. I would rather deal with a sinus infection than go through the absolutely hell this medication put me through EVER again. I have NEVER had a problem with any medication untill now.,F,30,10  days 1X O,8/5/2010,Zmax
