0, 4, Adult acne,Naseau and feeling slightly dizzy and diahorea,Will be calling doctor if I can reduce the dosage. My skin is clearer and I hope I don't put on weight,F,60,2  weeks100mg,6/29/2016,Aldactone
1, 4, hair loss,Absolutely helped my hair regrow -- also_ an unexpected plus: I had been getting cramping pain in my lower abdomen from a growing ovarian cyst. (I have PCOS.) Those cramps have just about all gone away on the Spiro. We recently built up to 200mg. After 2.5 weeks on that dosage_ I started experiencing scary side effects: Leg cramps_ breast pain_ light headedness_ headaches_ confusion (especially with things like name/word recall)_ cramping around my lower back. I've been taking a lower dosage (150mg per day) for a week?leg cramps are gone and the confusion is much less. But I've noticed that about 7-8 hours after I've taken the medication_ I can still get disoriented/light headed and anxious_ especially if I've had a stressful day. The cramping in my lower back happens if I don't take another dose right away. I tested how long these symptoms last without taking a another dose: Eventually_ the symptoms go away and my body calms down after about 2 hours. Its a scary process. I talke,I'm going to talk to talk to the doctor and drop my dosage back to 100mg_ or maybe lower.  My doc said 200mg is the effective dosage for hair regrowth_ but I was seeing regrowth at 100 mg.,F,36,3  months100mg 2X D,6/9/2016,Aldactone

4, 4, facial hair,Initial Headaches and dizziness but goes away.,"This medication worked well for me. I notice the facial hair slowed drastically (about 80% completely gone. However_ I have experienced great weight loss on this medication which I am concerned about. My Dr. said I would lose""water weight"" a couple of pounds at best. So far I've lost about 15 pounds which is not okay as I was already a smaller framed woman (115 lbs). I worry that it can't be healthy to lose weight so rapidly without diet or exercise. I'm considering stopping this medication though I'm definitely achieving my goal with the removal of the facial hair_ I'm losing weight way too fast.",F,35,3  months50mg,3/8/2016,Aldactone

11, 4, Acne,At first horrible break out for the first 3 months on and off. Then sudden clearing that stayed clear. I had more headaches than normal and muscle tightness. But skin looked amazing. By 6 months my skin was beautiful with occasional acne that would clear at a single pop. My skin felt less oily and perfectly balanced. My mood swings got really bad_ dizziness and having a use the restroom a lot was very annoying. I gained 10 lbs which were hard to rid myself of. Month 8_ I started having severe intestinal issues_ I would have cramping and horrible gas that would clear out a room. The gas was 24-7 upon waking up. I tried to alter my diet_ but nothing helped. I continued to have stomach issues_ but my skin still looked amazing. By month 11 I started noticing sexual problems_ I was diagnosed with PGAD- Persistent Genital arousal disorder and I am now being treated for that. I have stopped all medications_ including my birth control that I have been on for over 12 years. PGAD is no joke_ and,,F,32,1  years50 MG 2X D,9/18/2015Email,Aldactone

13, 1, Occasional cystic acne,About a week and a half after starting this med I started feeling this horrible feeling in my chest and overall just not good feeling.  At one point my legs and arms were tingly and my left hand became numb and cold to the touch_ trouble breathing_ irregular heart beat and muscle weakness .  I went to ER and was advised to stop the meds immediately.,I was so looking forward to clear skin... but this is not the med for me.,F,36,10  days100 mg 1X D,7/12/2015,Aldactone
14, 5, Pcos hair loss/thinning,Worked wonders_ initially prescribed with metformin for pcos_ my hair was coming out in clumps. Metformin made me very sick so stuck with the spironolactone only. It takes 60 days for me to see a difference but my hair feels amazing_ my skin is amazing and body hair growth has slowed also I am the thinnest Ive been since high school with no diet changes. Love this med. No bad side effects either,,F,36,4  months50mg,6/15/2015Email,Aldactone
15, 1, acne during period,my period came a few days early in April_ but this month (May)_ it is 5 days late and nowhere in sight.

It's just too early to start to regulate my period.,F,16,30  days30 mg 2X D,5/28/2015,Aldactone
16, 1, Acne,Started taking this drug for extremely bad acne. Cleared up my face completely- I never get zits anymore and my face is virtually flawless. However_ the drug has completely altered my body in the way it functions mentally and physically. I am dizzy all the time_ experience muscle pains in my legs_ have constant headaches_ am externally tired all the time no matter how much sleep I get_ am depressed and moody_ experience anxiety attacks frequently_ have irregular menstrual periods_ am increasingly irritable_ and experience an overall feeling of lethargy.,I would not recommend taking this medication_ especially in younger people. Of course it did wonders for my acne problem_ but the side effects are a bigger issue than my clear skin. I am an athlete and since taking this medication my abilities have dropped significantly- due to the fact that my muscles have become too weak to withstand heavy activity and that I get extremely worn out and tired within the first few seconds of exercising. I am in great shape and have never experienced this before. My coaches assumed I was anemic_ due to my drowsiness_ but we finally figured out that this medication was the root cause of my problems. Since taking this drug I have also become more dehydrated and have gained 5 lbs- which is not normal for me as I am in shape_ exercise daily_ and have a healthy diet. I've read on this site that this medication has been successful for many people_ but I think that at a dosage as high as mine and even at such a young age_ this medicine's benefits are not worth the side effects. I stopped taking it today and hope my body will return to the way it was before I started taking this medicine.,F,17,9  months100mg 2x/D,5/26/2015,Aldactone
17, 4, Cystic acne,Cystic acne is gone.  Skin looks better at age 60 than at 20_ 30_ or 40.  Dry mouth never went away. Breasts are enormous. I had no idea this could be why until I heard that it is used for feminization of transgender people. My dr had suggested breast reduction--she must not know either. Slight weight gain but breasts are so big that I can't find clothes. Guess I need to make a decision: perfect skin with few wrinkles and cartoonish breasts or facial cysts and clothes that fit over my boobs.  Forgot to mention that my skin is virtually wrinkle free_ oh_ and my boobs bloat!,,F,60,10  years50 my,5/7/2015,Aldactone

Hasn't made me feel dehydrated_ weak_ etc as it has some_ though I have had some diahrrea (unpleasant but livable_ I assume it'll go away as my body adjusts to the meds).

I'm very happy with this even though the weight loss has me concerned a little (I'm at 100 lbs.right now). I'm eating almost everything and that doesn't change my current weight.

30, 5, acne_ hair thinning_ facial hair,initial dizziness but stopped experiencing after a few weeks. Could have been due to not drinking enough fluids through out the day.,My acne has decreased dramatically and my skin no longer as oily. I used to have to wipe my face multiple times throughout the day and make up never stayed on. Now my skin is hydrated and not oily. My hair has stopped failing out and I am growing new hair near my hair line. I am also taking 10mg of biotin per day which probably helping the most with regrowing my hair. my facial hair has decreased; i still get one stubborn hair on my chin but I believe that it will soon disappear with prolonged usage.

Weight loss (skinniest I have ever been in my life!)_ high energy and felt great.,I started taking Spironolactone after talking to a co-worker about adult acne. (She was Canadian) and said that her Doc had perscribed her 100mg/daily of Spiro for her adult acne and she had no side effects. I made an appt with my Doc and she investigated it and finally decided that I could give it a try. It took about 2 months before I started noticing ANY side effects (good/bad). i.e. I did not see any results for 60 days. After 60 days my skin was completely clear of acne (face_ chest and back all clear)_ I was 10 lbs skinnier_ I was sleeping good and was in overall good spirits! After a few months (maybe 4-6?) I started experiencing some heart palpations or instances where it felt like my heart would stop....then start again. When I talked to my Doc about it_ she was intrigued. We ran tests_ but could never come up with anything conclusive. Over the years I have started and stopped this drug due to a pregnancy and trying to alleviate acne with other more natural solutions... but to date_ this has been the only drug that ever worked and had positive side effects for me.

I also suffer from severe headaches and migraines for have battled them for about 23 years now.  I have had a dramatic decrease in my headaches since taking this medication.  I am so pleased.  The dermatologist could not explain the change in headaches but I spoke with my nuerologist stated that I most likely have been suffering from hormonal headaches and that because this medicine reduce the amount of testosterone levels and therefor may be reducing my headaches.

It seems that with this drug its possibly mg sensitive.  25 seems to be my number_ for now anyways_ kind of like the sleep number bed_ there might be a number with this too that works for each different individual and their body.

I am pleased that I read about this product after being diagnosed with PCOS.  I am on a low potassium diet to be on the safe side  (especially avoiding things like chocolate_ bananas and potatoes). I am walking about 45 minutes a day.  Another side affect of my PCOs is that I have high cholesterol which is going down too because of the increased activity and better eating habits on my part.  I am also not eating the red meat and cutting out Dairy quite a bit going soy_ chicken and fish.  I have 90 lbs to go to be down to my goal weight_ so I will check back in with you all in December.,F,37,30  days50mg 2X D,9/28/2011Email,Aldactone
51, 5, Decomp cirrhosis (edema) from Hep C,I like this drug.  I started on a higher dose.  It worked to prevent edema and ascites (fluid in the abdomen).  I've been able to reduce the dose and the side effect of breast enlargement.  Libido is reduced,I take fluid_ or_ better yet_ electrolyte replacement (Gatorade) to prevent muscle cramps.,M,64,2  years25 mg 1X D,9/9/2011Email,Aldactone

53, 5, Hair loss,Drinking water a lot as it goes straight through me. Periods are irregular and coming every 2-3 weeks though very light.,Drug is helping hair loss_ was told it would take from 6 to 12 months to start to work. Upped the dosage from 25 to 100mg and noticed it working after only a month. Have a lowered libido and was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this. Always had problems with constipation_ but this has now rectified itself. Weight gain is not a problem at all any more. I love the drug. No other side effects_ however will cut down gradually to see if the libido picks up.,F,45,5  months100 MG 1X D,8/5/2011,Aldactone
54, 5, Acne,None,Love it. After years of acne I am thrilled taking Aldactone.  It is the only thing that keeps my skin clear. It also seems to help keep my blood pressure normal.,F,51,3  years100 MG 1X D,7/24/2011Email,Aldactone
55, 4, acne,stiff muscles caused by low sodium,I've been on aldactone for several months_ seen solid improvement in my moderate acne.  It has helped much more than any thing else I have ever taken_ birth control_ antibiotics_ topical gels_ etc...  I think it's worth a try if you are plagued with stubborn acne but definitely need periodic blood tests to make sure you are staying healthy.  Caused my sodium levels to fall below normal and now have to drink lots of electrolytes to maintain a normal level.,F,34, 100 1X D,7/2/2011Email,Aldactone
56, 4, Acne,Breast tenderness_ weight loss,Has worked great for me. I currently use this with retin-a and duac gel_ the combination has given me awesome results for my acne! I have been on every oral medication out there for acne besides Accutane and Aldactone has worked wonders even at the low dose I'm on. My skin tone is even brighter and I have no new break outs.,F,30,2  months50 mg 2X D,6/12/2011,Aldactone

58, 5, Hair loss_ acne_ hirsutimsm,Breasts got larger_ body shape more feminine_ weight very steady,I started this medication mainly for the hair loss. My hair loss was a combination of telogen effluvium and androgenic alopecia from PCOS. The hair loss leveled out and only slightly increased over the years. My skin has improved from cystic acne to people telling me I have some of the best skin they have ever seen.  I never get a pimple. One of the most striking things is what has happened with my body and weight. Prior to starting this medication_ I dieted and exercised hard core all the time and my weight would range from 128 (if training) to about 146 and the swing would occur throughout the year. I would have to work hard to keep below 142. When exercising_ I would also bulk up in a way that did not look very feminine in the upper body. Spironolactone stopped that. My weight is a constant 130 with or without exercise and I have not dieted since I started this medication. I no longer have a huge appetite and all binging behavior ceased.  I can eat what I want and if I gain even a pound (such as on vacation)_ it comes right off.  When I get sick_ my weight drops to the mid to lower 120s so actually_ keeping weight on is more of a problem.,F,35,7.5  years50 mg 2X D,11/28/2010,Aldactone
59, 3, Acne & excessive hair,Periods are lighter. Same period pain. I'm more emotional & I cry more (but happy tears.) I urinate a LOT. I have an INCREASED sex drive. I've noticed some hair on my body is lighter.,My Dr put me on it for excessive hair_ & I take it for acne_ as it cleared my friends hormonal acne. Weird thing is my hormone tests come back normal. I have a high sex drive_ but Aldactones suppose to decrease it_ I find it increases mine even more_ which is weird. It's testosterone that makes us aroused_ oh well. I'm a happy person_ but find I'm more emotional on it_ I cry more_ but happy tears. I'm still breaking out heaps_ but the pimples are not as big. I also use proactiv. I've noticed this week my body hair in some places is lighter. I also did laser hair removal on my face 4 wks ago & not 1 hair has grown back. I want to see what happens after being on Aldactone for 6 months in conjunction with laser. I know Aldactone increases fertility & causes birth defects in male fetus' so I'm unsure about it for that reason_ I don't take the pill because of it's risks!,F,30,2  months100mg 1X D,8/3/2010,Aldactone
