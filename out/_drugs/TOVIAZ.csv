0, 3, Interstitial Cystitis,Dizziness_ unable to focus_ just generally feeling weird,This is an update to my previous review (2010 I think?). I am out of remission with my IC again_ and I'm finding almost all the drugs I took for it last time around are reacting a little differently this time for some reason. Toviaz still works well_ though now it can make me REALLY dizzy and spacey_ which I don't remember happening last time at all.,F,39, 4 1X W,11/4/2014,Toviaz
1, 1, overactive bladder,Hallucinations_ memory loss_ difficulties with situational awareness.  Dementia-like symptoms.,"Toviaz was a disaster for my mother.  Her urologist started her out at 4 mg_ which had little effect_ so he increased the dose to 8 mg.  At this dose_ Mom experienced hallucinations_ memory loss_ and with what I would call difficulties with situational awareness.  (For example_ she and my dad were on vacation and she asked him one evening what time he had to milk the cows the next day.  Dad grew up on a farm_ but Mom and Dad are retired and Dad hasn't lived on a farm since he was a boy.)  Mom also had difficulty with mechanical things_ such as operating the remote_ microwave_ car locks_ etc.  Our family doctor thought she had some sort of rapid-onset dementia.  We followed up with her neurologist_ fearing the worst_ and he asked a raft of questions and did a number of tests.  Tests were all negative_ but there had been one recent change in meds: Toviaz.  ""I don't want you on Toviaz!"" the neurologist exclaimed.  Mom discontinued the Toviaz in September and was back to normal by the end of November.",F,73,4  months8 mg 1X D,6/29/2014Email,Toviaz
2, 3, overactive bladder,The med worked for overactive bladder_ but also constricted the urethra_ resulting in decreased rate of urinary discharge and requiring much more time.  With a cytoscopy or cath_ the urethra opens up_ and discharge rate is normal again.,,F,51,2  years 1X D,5/14/2011,Toviaz
3, 4, Bladder - IC,,My urologist recommended I try this over Enabelex_ and I'm so glad I did. It does have much fewer side effects than Enablex. Doesn't dry me out as much all over_ but really keeps me from having to get up to pee as much at night (the main reason I take it). Only downside is there is no generic.,F,35,4  months 1X D,10/1/2010Email,Toviaz
