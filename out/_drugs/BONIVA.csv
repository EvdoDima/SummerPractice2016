1, 1, osteoporosis,severe leg pain; severe back & joint pain,I had to be taken by ambulance from work to the hospital because pain got so severe I could no longer sit or stand. This medicine is poison and the doctor who prescribed it to me is responsible for giving me poison. It's been almost 2 months since I took one dose and still in pain and having problems walking.  I pray these side effects go away.,F,51,1  months150 mg,7/21/2016Email,Boniva
2, 1, Osteopenia,Boniva gave me ulcers.,I am very healthy and active.  Three months after taking Boniva_ I had violent gastric episodes.  Heartburn_ bloating_ belching and some bowel problems. After many doctor appointments_ I realized I had the symptoms synonymous with ulcers. After research_ I discovered that many people have reported ulcers from the use of bishosphonates. I have no doubt that my health problem started with Boniva.  I quit the stuff immediately_ and am currently on a healing diet that I hope will help.  The symptoms I developed changed my daily life.  I agree with others_ this stuff is poison.  Also_ this is the first time I've ever contributed a review to ANY website.  I decided to do it because I appreciate learning about other's experiences with drugs.  I wanted to help warn others about the dangers of Boniva.  There are other remedies for bone loss that are being researched_ and I intend to find out more.  I'm also looking into diet options_ and a product called AlgaeCal_ a high absorption calcium.  If anyone has other options_ please post.  Good luck to everyone!,F,58,3  months 1X M,7/12/2016,Boniva
3, 1, Osteoporosis,Only a few day after starting Boniva I started getting burning aches and pains in my arms_ shoulders elbow. It felt like it was deep in my bones. Now  I'm having problems with both of my shoulders. I can't lift my arms up over my head to comb my hair. After the first two doses I called my dr to inform her how I was feeling. She said take it for one more month and see if the side effects go away. They only got worse. I then called to tell her I wasn't taking it anymore. I explained how I was feeling and she said I needed to go to an orthopedic dr because the sides affect were not caused from the Boniva. And in fact she said it sounds like I have arteritis. I was never told I had arteritis before I started the Boniva This is a horrible drug. It needs to be taken off the market asap. I would not recommend to anyone.

8, 1, Decrease in bone density,Have been on Miacalcin for many years. Dr. Said bone density had gone down and prescribed Boniva. I put him off for 6 months then he convinced me to take it. As instructed I took pill with about 10 oz of water at 7:30 in the morning. Did not sit or lie down until several hours later. By 7:00 pm I was in pain. Legs neck shoulders. I felt like every bone and muscle in my body was hurting. Slept none At all that night due to pain. Could barely walk the next day. My right hand and wrist was useless. Could not use it at all. Low grade fever later that day and night. 20 days into. The month I had red blisters on my neck and face. Then scaled off like a sunburn. Month finally over. Still skin problems but joint pains are almost gone. Hopefully the skin problems will evidentially go away also. Have an appointment with a rheumatologist next week. Unless my T scores are off the chart I will not take any more of these types of drugs. Back to my Miacalcin. Never had a broken bone in my life. Another 20 years of nothing cannot be as bad as one month of Boniva.,,F,69,1  months150 mg,3/1/2016,Boniva

22, 1, Osteoporsis,Within 1 hour I had piercing head pain which increased with movement. Took my blood pressure and it was 152/103. At my physician's office 9 days earlier it was 118/78. I am an athlete who does triathlons and in training for my first ironman. I immediately went to the doctor and she had to put me on blood pressure medication. Day 2 wasn't much better. Day 3 was fairly good with the blood pressure under control and minor headache. Continued with my training for the ironman which is on September 27. Day 4 woke up with the severe headache and my diastolic pressure (the lower number over 100). The jabbing head pain nearly caused a fall. By 4pm I started with excruciating stomach pain.

Went back to the doctor and had X-rays taken of my ribs_ then a ct scan with contrast and another one without contrast of my lungs and they found nothing thank God! then I came to this site and bingo!

I went back to the doctor because of pain in my left leg (had a previous right femur fracture with IM rod insertion). I am scheduled for surgery to put a rod in my left leg due to atypical femur fracture. This poison works by preventing loss of bone. But it doesn't allow new bone to form so all that's left is old bone which is brittle. I refused my last DEXA scan because_ frankly_ I don't care what the numbers are. I am a) not going to change what I am doing now (supplements and diet) and b) the scan measures quantity and not quality of bone and so is misleading.

54, 1, I broke a rib,The first time I took this once a month pill it nearly killed me. I began throwing up liters of blood and passing it through my rectum for hours before a friend found me.  I was in ICU for 14 days total.  The massive bleeding continued for ten days durning which I received 17 transfusion's  of my rare blood type to keep me alive. Throughout those ten days I was not allowed to eat any food what so ever while they  made several attempts to locate and cauterize the many deep holes this drug had eaten into the lining of my duodenal area within only  seven days following my taking it.  On the 10th day in ICU they made a last ditch effort to save my life by operating on me. They opened me up to sew close the deep holes  Boniva created.  After 14 days in ICU_ and another five elsewhere_ I was placed in a nursing home for 28 days to recover.  Within the first five days of being there I suffered a stroke for which Dr. Athos refused to listen to my daughter's pleas to come and see me immediately,This drug has a black box warning which says do not give to patients with GERD. My doctor gave me a free trial dosage which was one pill per month even though he had been treating my GERD for four years prior. The only bone related issues I had were Arthritis in one knee and in the knuckles of both hands.  For that pain I had received two localized Cortisone Injections twice a year for two years before I fell out of my bed and  broke a rib at age 78.,F,78,1  monthsunknown 1X M,4/17/2014,Boniva

59, 2, Osteoporosis 25% bone loss,Flu-like symptoms beginning the first evening.  Chills_ muscle aches_ headache_ nausea_ bitter taste_ diarrhea_ sleepiness_ weakness.  Chills_ aches_ nausea were severe for the first two days_ but subsided after about 4 days.  I was unable to work or do normal activities for 5 full days the first and second month I took Boniva.I skipped a month_ (just too busy to be sick for 5 days) and took my third dose the following month.  By my third dose the symptoms had stopped except for mild weakness_ sleepiness and diarrhea lasting about 2 days.  I think I can live with that.,I gave Boniva a 2 (Not Satisfied) because of the severity of the side effects for the first two doses_ I won't know if it was effective until my next bone scan.  As long as the side-effects remain mild_ I plan to stay on the drug until my next DEXA scan.,F,56,3  months150 1X M,2/10/2014Email,Boniva
