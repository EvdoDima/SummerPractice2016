0, 2, A-Fib,Severe stomach pain_ headaches_ some chest pain and muscle weakness,I did the 3 day ICU stint to get on the Tikosyn.  I passed with flying colors! However_ in the ensuing weeks I have had almost constant nausea and then very severe stomach pain.  Today my electrophysiologist took me off of it.  He felt I have given it my best shot and so do I.  I will go back to Rythmol and Verapamil and we will talk about an ablation. This was a rough go and I hope my stomach will settle down.  If you have any GI issues I would not recommend Tikosyn.,F,74,4  weeks250mcg 2X D,11/25/2015,Tikosyn

5, 4, Following cardioversion due to Afib,So far_ I feel much better than I did_ but the last two days I have lost the initial surge of energy.

8, 4, A-fib,Tikosyn was RX'd to help maintain NSR post ablation. I feel the ablation was successful (increased energy)  but I'm still very aware of my heart?not sure if it's flutters or if I'm out of NSR. My physician wants to maintain me on this med for nine more months. He feels it's working well. I'm not sure I can continue for that duration  because of the side effect I'm experiencing.,I am experiencing significant hair loss!

12, 3, Atrial fibrilation,"Diagnosed with atrial fibrilation in May 2010.  Was on Meprolol_ and then Sotolol_ before being placed on Tiksyn.  Spent 3 boring days in the hospital while they monitored my heart and blood pressure (highest pressure/BP was 149/110 with a pulse of 108)_ and my creatine levels in my kidneys.  3 VERY boring days.  Have intermittent defibrilation so much that they have tried twice to do cardioversion (stopping your heart with an electric shock and then restarting it - kind of a manual ""reset"" of the old ticker)_ but couldn't because I was NOT in defib.  Experience defib every now and then_ but just started to pick a really nasty case of hives:  hands start to itch_ and then random parts of the body would begin to itch too.  The worse case was when my upper shoulders_ thighs_ buttocks_ calves_ and lower back was covered in hives.  Took Benydril_ which slowly killed the itch over 2 hours but if you wanted my credit card numbers - I would have given them to you to stop the itch.",Since it is a special order medicine_ it is somewhat costly.  I have Blue Cross_ which nicely lowers the price_ but RECOMMEND to anybody with a health savings account plan with your employer to PARTICIPATE_ so that way you can get your money back on the cost of the drug_ and get a nice deduction from your taxes at the end of the year.,M,48,120  days125uG 2X D,12/2/2010,Tikosyn
13, 3, A-fib_ A-futter_ SVT_ V-tach_ tach,dizzy_ short of breath_ not feeling my fast heart beat_ headache_ hair loss_ chest pain_,"I started tikosyn after a 3rd failed ablation_ no other medication keeps me out of A-fib.  But no other medication put me into V-Tach or SVT's either.  So I guess it is a catch 22.  My hair is falling out_ but I atributed that to my hyothyroidism I will ask my doctor.  I thought my medication was working well_ or well enough and then my doctor asked me a question.  ""If you never had heaart problems before_ would you seek help now for the way you feel and the way your chest feels?""  My answer I would not only seek help but I would most likely go to the ER  I do feel better haven't been hospitalized in 7 weeks_ a record for me.  for the last 11 months I hadn't lasted 3 days out of the hospital with out ending up back in ICU.",F,45,7  weeks,12/29/2009Email,Tikosyn
14, 3, AFib and AFlutter,Personality change.  I do not feel like myself.  Anxious. Still get the AFlutter (my thing) but only for a few days at a time.  I have had one frightening episode of chest pain and do get dizzy and lose my balance.,I am also losing hair and I really don't like the strange feelings I have.  Wonder how few of us are on it.  Don't seem to see much input from users. Since I have a pacer and defibrillator_ I am protected more than most. Have developed  muscle spasms and aches_too.  I really don't like the way I feel_ as I said before but it has helped me convert myself to regular rythmn.,F,73,67  days,12/14/2009,Tikosyn
15, 1, Mixed arrythmias,Cardiac arrest after the 4th dose,I was only on this two days_ while in the hospital (as required.)  I felt very strange the entire time.  Then I had cardiac arrest and emergency defibrillation.  Doing much better on Rythmol now.,F,59,2  days,12/7/2009,Tikosyn

17, 5, flutter,For the three months I have been on it my breathing is great.  I can walk_ cut grass_ work in yard_ pretty much back to normal old self. I also take Digtek and Warfarin. I also have vocal cord dysfunction which caused alot of my former breathing problems and I control that with a nasal rinse and nose spray.  So far the drug is doing everything it is supposed to but I'm still a little afraid of taking it with what can happen suddenly.,Not knowing if Tikosyn is the problem but am balding_ have some kind of skin scaling and redness in spots which come and go. Am being monitored every three months. As of right now_I give it a 5.  My doctor says only certain people can benefit from it and he thought I was one that could.,F,71,3  months,10/21/2007,Tikosyn
18, 1, atrial fibrillation,I have been lethargic_ nervous_ sleepy and generally not feeling good.  I generally bounce back into afib every 2nd_ 3rd or 4th day_ with some bouts of higher blood pressure.  I never used to have any problems with blood pressure.  By not knowing how I will feel from day to day it is difficult to plan even a day ahead.,It requires 3 day hospitalization to get put on it.  ECGs have to be monitored for irregularities.  Only special physicians are permitted to prescribe it and pharmacies do not keep it in stock.  They have to special order it.  The most troubling possible side effect is causing a rapid heart rate which occasionally could be fatal_ according to the descriptive sheet from Pfizer.I have a friend who seems to be doing fine with the stuff.,M,66,7  months,4/15/2007,Tikosyn
