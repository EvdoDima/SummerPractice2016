1, 1, High Blood Pressure,Severe weight gain_ discolored toenails.,For years I have been attempting to lose weight.  When I stopped taking Atacand_ the weight began to slowly come off and the discoloration on my toe nails went away.  Atacand was the only medication that I was able to take to lower my blood pressure for I live in a high elevation... I'm not too sure if it's worth the weight gain...or the discolored toenails that I thought to be a fungus.,F,57,7  years 1X D,6/28/2011Email,Atacand hct
2, 5, hypertension,None known.,I started taking this prescription after checking on this site to find out if anyone else had been having problems with Diovan.  It wasn't really lowering my blood pressure_ so I saw the side-effects I had been experiencing.  My doctor tried me on Benacar_ but that caused leg pain after a few days.  Someone on the Benacar site mentioned Atacand and how well it worked.  I tried it and had been taking it for several years without any noticeable side-effects.  And it lowered my blood pressure.  I stopped taking it for almost three weeks when my insurance plan lowered the amount they would pay towards non-generic meds.  I took Cozaar for a short time and it was a very bad experience.  I had back and joint pain_ my eyes twitched_ feet swelled and itched and my taste was off.,F,60, 32mg 1X D,4/18/2011Email,Atacand hct

4, 3, High Blood Pressure,I have had no side effects.,Started out on 16 mg.  later the 32 mg.  No real lowering of BP on either one. The diuretic makes me get up almost hourly at night.   I DO wish it would work_ as I want to continue due to no side effects.  It is rather expensive.,F,67,2  months,11/10/2009Email,Atacand hct

7, 5, High blood pressure,After taking Atacand HCT 16/6.25 (half of 32/12.5)_ my joint pain caused by Benicar 20/12.5 has gone away.  My BP becomes much more stable during my daily activities. I don't feel any side effects now.  I'll report if there is a side effect developed in the future.,My doctor gave me Atacand HCT 32mg/12.5mg.  I take half of this drug (16/6.25mg)and my BP is average 120/75. In the past while I took Benicar HCT 20mg/12.5mg (for about 11 months)_ my BP was about 130/80. My feeling is that Atacand is a better drug for me.,M,67,7  days,6/4/2007,Atacand hct

9, 5, Hypertenstion,Minimal side effects_ possibly some diarhhea_ but not sure if that is related,This medicine has been pretty effective at controlling my blood pressure. I was was previously taking Diovan HCT_ which was doing well_ but with an insurance change I had to switch to Atacand HCT which is a similar drug. It seemed to take a few days to really take effect.,F,35,1  months,12/25/2006,Atacand hct

Afternoon fatigue_ Blurred vision_ Orthostatic Dizziness_ ED_ and Thinning Hair.,Highly recommend.  It's great to be back.,M,50,1  weeks,12/25/2006,Atacand hct
11, 5, HBP,Just began today after 1.5 years on Diovan HCT 80/12.5.  Must say this drug worked immediately at stabilizing my BP with no side effects other than energy to spare.,Will note side effects or health concerns as the months progress.,M,50,1  days,12/17/2006,Atacand hct
