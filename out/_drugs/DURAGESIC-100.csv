0, 5, Reflex Sympathic Dystrophy,At this point I really don't have any side effects.,the exact dose is 275 every 72hrs. The fentanyl patch saved my quality of life_ such as it is.  I was in excrutiating pain for 2 years while trying all those oxy___whatever pills on the market until the patches were introduced to me and finally some relief.  The only problem I problem I have with them_ honestly_ is that over the  years I have been titrated up on the dose so much_ because the disease I have is a progressive one_ that there really is not much further to go without stopping my breathing.  And when I need surgery to change the battery in my neuro stimulator_ what pain medicine do they give me?? Fentyal is the top of the line.  I've been given dillaudid before and it takes the edge off.  But that's the problem with this medicine...its fantastic for major and long term pain_ but be careful.....there is a limit....I know I've reached mine and now I'm in a predicament and I still have more and more pain_ as well as break thru pain.,F,47,18  years275 3X W,2/8/2016Email,Duragesic-100
1, 3, degenerative discs failed fusions,No appetite whatsoever Severe weight lossDry mouthDifficulty passing urinePalpationdifficulties falling and staying asleepLack of energyI started on 25mcg patches 8 years ago but after a while your body gets used to it_ so it doesn't have the same pain killing effect which necessitates you going onto a bigger dose. I'm now on the largest patch and have been for nearly 4 years and I still find the pain to much to bare even with taking oral morphine on top for breakthrough pain.,,M,,8  years100mcg,10/1/2015Email,Duragesic-100
2, 4, DDD spinal stenosis arthritis L2-5,No real side effects other than adhesive giving a rash.,Im not taking Duragesic but the generic. There was no listing for it. Its from the company Apotec. Ibe read on other sites it doesnt work as well as other patches but simce this is the only patch Ive used so far I cant complain. Seems to be working just fine to me. Havent had this much pain relief in years. I have two issues with this patch. #1. Its too thin. Its like a mylar ballon and feels like one too. Its so thin it crinkles on your own and so it doesnt lay flat on the skin. Ive used a breathable bandage to keep it flat. I must me somewhat allergic to the adhesive because when I take the patch off on third day the skin is irritated and red and itchy but doesnt hurt. I thought Id give it a month and in a few days I'll get a refill and will try a different brand. Hopefully it wont cause the irritation.,M,44,4  weeks100mcg,7/13/2015Email,Duragesic-100
3, 5, MCTD,Little nausea,I'm only taking 50 mcg every 72 hrs.  A total life changer for me.  I live with chronic pain over my whole body.

4, 3, degenerative disc disease,Takes 12 hours to work_ then only works for 24 hours. Maybe if there were a higher dose it would work better. Works good when it actually works_ but 72hrs..NO WAY!,,F,30,1  months100mcg/h,7/11/2014Email,Duragesic-100
5, 5, degenerated disc's,"Minor itching morning after applying. Occasional night sweats_ I think related to time of applying. Never had one remain usable for more than 48 hrs. But_ I have a somewhat normal life now_ & side effects would have to get much_ much worse for me to switch from them. Best pain management I've had_ & while I'm not pain free_ I am able to lead a functional_ productive life_ & not spend my days back and forth from sofa to bed trying to find a comfortable position.

9, 1, Back pain following back surgery,I was prescribed a 50mgs Fentanyl patch. I had placed my first Fentanyl patch on my back on Friday_ July 12_ 2013 and placed my second patch on a different area of my back on Monday_ July 15_ 2013.The first 3 days of usage caused me to become very tired and to have much increased pain_ not only in my lower back_ (sacroiliac area)_ but_ also in my shoulders_ neck and upper back. Additionally_ I developed severe constipation. (At the time of this writing_ Wednesday_ July 17_ 2013 shortly after midnight_ I have not had a bowel movement for four days_ despite having used stool softeners).My second patch resulted in my falling asleep at my computer; sleeping with my head on my computer (laptop) from 7:45am to 6:30pm_ Tuesday_ July 16_ 2013 and waking up with acute edema and excruciating pain. I kept waking up and then nodding off_ (with my head falling onto my laptop). I became unconscious_ disoriented to time_ and incoherent. I was_ as well_ off-balanced and exceptionally woozy!,"A friend stopped over just when I needed for someone to help me. His coming over was incredibly fortuitous. He had a very difficult time waking me_ with my continuing to nod off with my head lying on my computer. He left after both us believed that I was fully conscious. I wasn't. I kept nodding off_ repeatedly_ finding myself with an unlit cigarette in my hand. I_ in time_ woke up enough to be able to call my insurance company's 24-Hour ""Call a Nurse"". We agreed that I needed to call my pain management doctor. He was reached by his answering service. The answering service relayed information from my pain management doctor to me. I was informed to_ immediately_ remove the patch. I did so.I_ at this time_ (almost 12:30am_ Wednesday_ July 17_ 2013)_ am becoming more alert and oriented. I still am having pain; but_ the severity is decreasing. I remain very tired and shall_ soon_ go to bed.This is PRECISELY what happened for me when I was in a SNF and had been prescribed a 50mg Fentanyl patch. The poor nurse who found me in an unconscious state was very frightened telling me_ a day later_ that I could have died. The insurance company RN told me the same thing and said that I was very lucky to have had my friend come over at the time that he did.  I call him_ ""my angel"". Maybe he really is!I have got to inform every doctor with whom I am presently working_ (and all future doctors)_ that I simply cannot take any opiate/opioid medication. Phew!

10, 3, Chronic pain from disc fractures,Has helped but have horrendous brain fog. Tiredness which is threatening my job security. I had to choose this drug_ morphine continuous release__ or methadone for my pain relief after major mess in Florida. I was taking oxycodone & perfectly fine_ but had to change to one of 3 I mentioned. This drug saved me from oxycodone withdrawals_ but now I am forever it's prisoner.

17, 5, Fractured spine - burst L4,Reduced appetite_ occasional insomnia upon initial application_ reduced effectiveness upon day 3 of patch life,After a 35 foot/5 storey fall upon concrete_ I smashed myself up pretty badly and was initially given IV morphine while in hospital (1 month) and then Oxycontin the first 3 months of my 6 month stay at a rehab' centre before moving onto Duragesic 50 mcg_ which was a MASSIVE improvement by the 2nd day..best thing the Doc's ever did for me!! I could never expect life to be perfect after smashing myself so terribly but Duragesic is FAR better than any other analgesic I've tried. Over time_ I've progressed to 75_ and recently 100 mcg as one of the discs has worsened and more pain relief has been required but no increase in side effects!!,M,38,3.5  years100 1X D,1/18/2012Email,Duragesic-100
18, 5, Generalized internal chronic RSD,Nausea_ vomiting_ tiredness,I tried over 60 various medications to control the intense chronic pain caused by my generalized internal chronic RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy). Only strong extended release narcotic painkillers work for me. The one that works best for me is Duragesic (brand name fentanyl patches made by Janssen Pharmaceutica). Generic fentanyl patches do not work as well for me_ if at all_ and cause me much worse side effects. I can say without the shadow of a doubt that Duragesic patches gave me back my life_ that is_ they gave me a life worth being called a life. Thanks to the Duragesic patches_ I can now work. I can also do the activities I enjoy most: sky diving_ horseback riding (especially circus type)_ water skiing_ rock climbing_ mountain hiking_ etc. I can never thank Janssen Pharmaceutica enough for making these wonderful fentanyl patches. The only negative point is the very high cost of the patches_ for patients whose medical insurance will not cover fentanyl patches and for uninsured patients.,F,37,9  years125 mcg 1X O,11/25/2011Email,Duragesic-100
19, 4, Lupus pain_ Fibromyalgia,Reduced appetite_ sweating_ mild nausea,I use the generic_ mylan brand fentanyl patch. I prefer this to the duragesic patch which gave me some skin irritation. Mylan sticks better and does not irritate my skin. I am so glad for this long lasting patch that gives me continuous relief for several days. I prefer it to popping oxicodone every few hours. Other pain meds caused way more ups and downs and fatigue than the patch. I feel almost normal_ pain is not gone_ but much reduced. Without this_ its was excruciating. I can lead an active life as opposed to being bedridden with pain. Just wish it wasn't so expensive. Fortunately my insurance has been covering the cost. I would give it 5 stars if sweating wasn't an issue and if it didn't cost so much_ and if it was easier to get off of. Once you start this drug_ it is extremely hard to get off of because the withdrawals are so severe. So I try to stay on the lowest dose I can tolerate.,F,53,8  years175mcg 1X O,9/7/2011Email,Duragesic-100
20, 4, Failed back surgeries,I also am suffering from severe nerve pain and have been given methadone for that.  Duragesic is the only medication that works for me and I like it due in part to a past addiction to codeine. With a patch and the fear of ODing on Duragesic it is the best method for me.,I change patches every 48hrs and I have now been on the 75mgc for so long on the second day I am feeling withdrawal symptoms of constant tiredness.,M,59,7  years75mg 1X D,8/7/2011Email,Duragesic-100

I have had 5 back surgeries-laminectomy (failed)_ spinal chord stimulator implanted_ battery changed_ stimulator removed and a spinal fusion/stabalization.  Nothing has worked!!!  I have of course tried every narcotic and non-narcotic pain med out there!

23, 5, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,dry mouth_ occasional withdrawal symptoms_ fatigue_ constipation_ initial skin rashes on application site,Has the potential to move you from constant intense pain and hopelessness to managed pain levels that are livable. I don't know if it is possible to get to a zero level of pain with it_ perhaps because I am resistant to take more than I do. The patches do not last for 3 days for me. I take them every 2 days and try to alternate changing (sets of) patches so that I change one or more patches each day. This means: at a dose of 200 ug/h_ use 100 patches. Put on patch A - 100 on day 1; put on B - 100 on day 2. On day 3 replace A with a new patch C - 100. This keeps the dosage more consistent. At 175 it works fine with A-75 and B-100_ etc. Variation of temperature can cause withdrawal symptoms for me_ which is frustrating. The initial skin irritation was addressed by spraying a corticosteroid inhaler on the skin in the application area_ then letting it dry before applying the patch_ for the first several months of use. Dental issues are a problem for long-term use_ as is constipation.,F,34,6  years125-225 1X O,12/31/2010,Duragesic-100
24, 5, Broken back. spinal cysts_ CPS,"Skin irritation (esp. w/ new SANDOZ patches)_ constipation_ occasional mood swings_ occasional nausea_ slight ""loopy"" sensation rarely",The SANDOZ branded fentanyl patches are now made by ALBA (a division of Johnson & Johnson)_ and as of March 2009 (the copyright date on the packaging)_ stopped using a gel reservoir with a porous membrane covering the reservoir in its high-dose patches (by 2010_ SANDOZ eliminated gel reservoirs in ALL of its fentanyl patches). Instead_ SANDOZ (like competitor Mylan) uses a matrix of Fentanyl in strands that melt with body heat. The matrix is covered with polyacrylate adhesive and backed with a VERY thin polyester/ethyl vinyl acetate covering  My body does not react well to these new patches; I get nausea (not uncommon; some studies show that up to 10% of people on ANY high-dose narcotics will develop nausea during product use) and my skin gets so irritated I can watch it pinken through the semi-opaque covering.  Pain doc is attempting to reduce my overall fentanyl usage (thus_ adding a box of 50 mcg/h in with the regular 75 mcg/h to facilitate switching from high to low).  I'm still having great success w/ the patch_ though--nothing keeps pain at bay like it.,F,47,3  years50-75 mcg 1X O,10/31/2010Email,Duragesic-100

Battled pain from severe fibromyalgia_ rheumaoid arthritis_ 3 herniated discs_ lups-I had just about had it with doctors and medications prescribed. I was in so much pain_ my quality of life was nil. This gave me my life back_ yes_ with a few changes_ but all I could handle. I did end up having all my teeth extracted and was told the patch was a factor in that but hey_ I got dentures and all is well. If you take this drug as directed it is a life save.

Cut back to 75mcg and I think clearly now but some pain has returned.,I was on morphine sulfate for a couple of years_ total of 90mg a day. This did little to help_ made me a little nauseous. Doc switch me to duragesic patch starting at 50 mcg for 6 days then to 100mcg. The 100mcg along with 15mg morphine sulfate for break through pain. This got rid of 80% of pain and did not even need morphine. Two weeks ago I cut back to 75mcg patch_ I could not  think clearly. Ok on 75mcg although I'm getting about 50% reduction in pain.,M,59,3  months 1X O,5/4/2010,Duragesic-100
27, 5, Chronic pain from nerve damage,A little tiredness and I have noticed my memory is not as sharp as it was sometimes-these side effects are NOTHING compared to other narcotic meds I have tried through the yrs and I have tried them all!!,This medicine has been a miracle for me and I am amazed that it is not prescribed more often for people who have severe and chronic pain. It is so amazing not to deal w/ the constant withdrawal/ups and downs of oxycontin_vicodin_and other more commonly presribed meds. Morphine gave me terrible migraines and restless legs as it would wear off and it made me sooo tired. These patches give a steady stream of med. that if used properly_prevent you from ever having to deal with all that agony. It also gives me better pain relief than any other med w/o any real side effects besides a little memory issue which could have more to do w/ my insomnia which is unrelated to this med.I have also only had to up my dose once in 4 yrs and that was because my condition worsened not because the drug became less effective. So_ talk to your dr. if you have chronic pain....people who have died or od'ed from Fentanyl have misused it - people don't die from using it correctly.,F,46,4  years50mg 1X O,4/6/2010,Duragesic-100

Been on Loritab 10 mg x4_ Lyrica_75mg x3 Demerol 50 mg x4_ Norco 10mg x 4_and now Percedan 4.35x6 and tinazidine 4mg x9 and now the 25mg patch. So far its only been 72 hours but I feel 0 relief from the patch. It's on my forarm and I keep it in place with bandages in an X over the patch. I am hoping my doctor will bump me up to 50mg tomorrow....I am sooooo sick of the pain. My quality of life sucks. I was working full time and walking 3 miles a day before this happened. It was supposed to be a simple surgery and back to work the next day.....that was in August 09. Do the 50's work without doping you up? I have a 10yr old to take care of. As for that person drinking the medicine...good luck and God be with you cause one of these times you are not gonna come out of it. This stuff is no game.

29, 5, chronic pain_ spinal tumors,mild constipation_ skin irritation from patch adhesive_ mood swings,This medication is a lifesaver_ literally.  I was ready to commit suicide because I could not stop the pain I was having from tumors on my spine and severe fibromyalgia.  I was first given it after a car accident_ and within an hour after the patch was put on_ I felt something I hadn't felt in YEARS:  Pain-Free.  It's not a perfect drug--it does cause constipation_ the adhesive is a skin irritant_ and my moods tend to swing up as the medicine gets absorbed and down as the dose runs out--and if you stop taking it suddenly_ you WILL go into opiate withdrawal_ no question.  But if you're a chronic pain sufferer who can't get relief no matter how many high-dose narcotic pills you take_ ask your doctor about the fentanyl 3-day patch (the generic name for Duragesic).  One patch can change your life...at least_ it did for me.,F,47,2  years50 mcg 1X O,3/7/2010Email,Duragesic-100
30, 5, Fibro_ herniated discs_ neuralgias,mild constipation_ skin irritation with Duragesic brand when worn above waist,This medicine literally saved my life.  Before it I was in such severe_ constant pain that I was actually seriously considering suicide.  I had zero quality of life.  This medication allowed me to be functional again and although I am far from being pain-free_ my quality of life is pretty good.  I am on disability but am able to have a life now.  I would highly recommend this medication to anyone with long-term_ severe chronic pain not getting relief from other pain meds.  I change my patch every 48 hours because on the third day it seemed like the drug was wearing off and I was needing lots of breakthrough pain meds. (Many Medicare Part D plans pay for up to 15 or 16 patches a month so ask your insurance carrier if you have the same issue).  I am now on minimal breakthrough pain meds.  I have been at the same dose for 6 1/2 years and have been able to avoid increasing the dosage by using alternative therapies along with the patch.  I have found that the Mylan brand_ being a smaller patch_ causes less skin irritation than Duragesic_ especially when worn on the very lower back/top of buttock area where less pulling occurs with movement.  Although the manufacturer tells you that you should wear it above the waist_ this is only because they only studied it there_ but I had no decrease in effectiveness wearing it on my lower back or upper buttock area.  The patches also stay on much better for me there_ with no need for tape or overlays.,F,34,7  years75 mcg 1X O,2/26/2010Email,Duragesic-100

Vivid nasty nightmares_ couldn't sleep_ was then tired in the day_ felt really sick.

I also was about at the stage of suicide from intractable pain_ ( back_ and chest ) for 5 months. If you can imagine how horrible and disconserting it is to have chest pain 24/7 for months_ and literally not be able to do for yourself.  Oral opiates just were awful_ made me sick_ didn't last_ or just didn't work.  At first I was very leery of starting the patch_ ( I am an RN ) but it got to a point where I was desperate for relief. Best thing I ever did.  It gave me back my life.  I have also just had my second cervical epidural with some relief but not enough_ unfortunately.,F,62,2  months,1/26/2010Email,Duragesic-100
34, 4, DDD_ L5_ perm nerve dmg in one leg,Nausea_ constipation_ tiredness,I have been on 50 mcg for at least 5 yrs. Without it I'd be on disability. Drug enables me to work and have a life most of the time. Some patch change days I am very nauseous to the point of having to stay in bed all day. Next day I'm fine. I have 5 mg oxycodone for breakthrough but seldom use. Also taking Lyrica_ helps w/ the nerve pain in the leg & arm but gained too much weight! I lost weight on Duragesic. The Mylan generic is best_ the name brand or the other generic increase the nausea. I can swim_ but have to watch exposure to sun & heat or too much medicine will be released @ one time. This medicine made me able to walk on my own w/o using a cane constantly. (Bc of nerve dmg in leg/foot still have to look down & walk carefully). All in all a good drug_ if one must be on an opioid.,F,50,5  years,9/15/2009,Duragesic-100
35, 5, Severe spinal pain after car crash,Addictive.  Constipation.  Difficulty reading (weird eye strain feeling).  Mild insomnia.  Get help with the withdrawal when/if you discontinue use.  Except for the withdrawal issues all the side effects while using were totally manageable.,"This drug was a miracle for me.  After a bad car accident I tried to avoid spine surgery for 3 years.  The patch was life saving for me.  My pain was so bad I was suicidal and none of the ""traditional"" painkillers worked for me.  I had to change the patch after 48 hours -- I could not go for 3 days as it would wear off too quickly and the third day was agony.  Tell your doctor if you think this is happening to you.  When I did finally stop using the patch I went off cold turkey_ on my own_ and I do not recommend that.  The withdrawal was awful and like torture so I highly recommend asking for your doctor's help.  The best part about the Duragesic patch was that it doesn't make you feel high.  You can function and think and have emotions_ etc...  And at the correct dose_ it will take away your pain to a manageable level.  I'm very petite and could never tolerate more than 50 mcg so I needed to take other meds for break through pain -- but so what?  The patch_ while I needed it_ gave me back my life.",F,34,3  years,3/19/2009,Duragesic-100
36, 2, Chronic Pain L4-5 surgery_ DDD_ OA,Somewhat severe constipation. Anxiousness that at a higher dose became unbearable. Uneven release of the drug from the patch.,I've been on this drug two different times. The first time we went up to 75mg and that is where I experienced the horrible anxiety. The second time_ a different MD due to a temporary move_ prescribed it incorrectly and I finally asked him to take me off of it. At that time I found that the generic patch stayed on better and the drug released more evenly. I never_ either time_ could go three days with one patch_ always only two. I also found that certain conditions such as warmer weather_ physical exertion_ caused the drug to release faster. Like most of this type of drug you really should decrease slowly but I found it difficult to go from 25mg to nothing without feeling quite sick. The first time I was on this drug was for 9 months. The second time was less than 2 months. The second time the MD incorrectly prescribed it along with MS Contin and as he increased it I had depressed breathing and heavy sleepiness and I KNEW something was very wrong.,F,51,2  times,2/8/2009,Duragesic-100

38, 1, Chronic abdominal pain,After 6 surgeries and many pain meds_ I ended up on Fentanyl Patch. 75mcg/hr down to 12.5mcg all had horrible side effects - on me.  I missed weeks of my life_ seizures_ possible unconscious at times_ slurred speech_ unable to walk_ constantly falling and getting hurt/cut_ unable to sit-up at times_ stayed awake for 2-3 days then slept for same_ very vivid dreams/nightmares_ and even severe cigarette burns everywhere (including on my body) which I dont remember.,"Not even after all my surgeries was I given Fentanyl.  Being a ""widower"" and living alone_ I do not feel that this drug is safe_ at least for me_ to use without having someone around.  For me and my body it was just a horrible_ horrible drug and I will never use it again unless it is in the hospital under the direct supervision of a physician and/or nurse to monitor me!",M,45,8  months,11/10/2008Email,Duragesic-100
39, 5, Disc pain and rotatory scoliosis,None that I've noticed. I used it a few years ago when I was obese_ and it made me sleep a lot. But now it doesn't.,"I used it years ago and started again recently. I believe this is the best long-acting pain reliever that exists. It was one of three options offered to me: Morphine_ Oxycontin or Fentanyl.  I tried the first two and didn't like them. Fentanyl is wonderful. There's no ""high"" like oxycontin. No side-effects like morphine. My breakthrough pain med use has gone down remarkably. I have to change patches every 48 hours_ as the 72 hour schedule didn't give me enough pain relief or consistent relief.  ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO LET YOU TRY THIS. It is WONDERFUL! However_ when you go off it you may have to use the Suboxone program. I did years ago and it worked to get me off the 75 mcg. dose I was on at the time. I'm only on 25 mcg now_ but I weigh half as much as I did then so I figure that's why less works now.",M,,4  years,10/16/2008,Duragesic-100
40, 4, Fibromyalgia,Constipation_ insomnia on first day of applying patch,Duragesic has been a God send for me. I was on Lorcet 10/650 4x a day and Ultram 50 4x a day_ but it caused a lot of stomach upset and wore off too soon and it seemed I was constantly popping pills. With Duragesic I get constant pain relief. I've been on 50mcg for 4 years. There is no 'high' feeling_ just relief from my chronic pain for 3 days without having to worry about having pills with me at all times. I do occasionally still get breakthrough pain(usually on the 3rd day) which I take Ultram 50 up to 4x a day to help control. I take a fiber supplement to help control the constipation_ which works as long as I am consistant in taking it. I tried the generic patches for a couple months but they only lasted 2 days for me. The first day I felt 'high' on them_ then_ not much pain relief and sort of a'withdrawal feeling' on the 3rd day. So I went back to the brand_ this medicine has given me more freedom in my daily life; I don't know how I ever existed without it.,F,34,4  days,9/5/2008,Duragesic-100
41, 5, HepC related Perip. Neuropathy,none! I don't even have withdrawal syndrome anymore,I am on 4 100mcg patches every three days. I used to take MEGA doses of morphine (6000mgs +). I had edema in my legs_ I lost my cough reflex and got double pneumonia_ I collapsed one day and almost didn't wake up due to CNS collapse. I suffered supremely coming off all that morphine_ but I would do it again in a heart beat. I am aware of my surroundings again_ I can remember going to the movies with my wife_ I can do little things around the house. I have my life back! thanks to Patches and suckers.,M,56,8  years,8/17/2008Email,Duragesic-100

43, 2, Spinal Disorders,Sweating_ Nervousness_ Anxiety,I started on the 12 mcg patch a month ago and cannot tolerate it. I think it can be helpful to a great many people but I am very hypersensitive to meds.  The biggest complaint I have was the non stop sweating which was supposed to abate and didn't.  I also absorbed it very quickly so by the 72 hour mark I was in withdrawals.  I did try to go to 48 hours but it knocked me for a loop.  And the most pain relief I had was probably for one MAYBE two days.  I just don't see the point of cycling like this and STILL having to take BT meds.,,51,1  months,5/8/2008,Duragesic-100
44, 1, MS,TERRIBLE SWEATING!  The slightest activity caused me to sweat completley through my clothing.  SO embarassing!,I had trouble getting the patch to stick with all the sweating.

45, 5, DDD Spine collapsing 3X Surg/fusion,First month diff slow breathing_ but give it time.  You get use to it and no longer notice these issues.  Mild sleeplessness.  Euphoric when tired.  Black-outs when sleep deprived.  Standing-sitting-driving.  Its like sleep walking.  Only if I have no had even near adequate sleep.,WOW!  What a life changing drug.  Tried every other narcotic on the market for years ending with oxycontin 80mg.  I was gagging taking so many pills.  Though the patches must be used at 2 day intervals.   3 is just an uphill battle fighting to get it back under control.  Most will need Tegaderm or overlay from Jannsen.  Takes a month or two to get used to but when you get at the right dose you can live virtually pain free.  Don't come off it and don't run out by abusing them.  Major withdrawl_ near seizure-like on high doses.  I am on 400mcg every 48hrs and have not seen anyone here even close.  Read that the highest you can go was 300.  Wrong!  Had Dr tell me he had people on 600.  I could easily go that high now after 7 years.  I was in a wheelchair and could not stand straight upright.  I have my life back.  Driving_ housework_ standing on concrete floors.  You name it.  I can go 90% of the day pain free with Actiq as a breakthru.  Had some issues with surgery anesthesia.

46, 3, severe hip pain due to OA,extreme sleepiness_ severe nausea/vomiting at higher dose.,I started on the 25 mcg patch for severe hip pain (I am getting hip replacement in June '08) and found it worked fairly well but I still needed 6-8 percocets (5mg) daily for BT pain. My doctor put me up to the 37.5 mcg patch (adding a 12.5 mcg to my 25 mcg) and within 30 hrs after application I developed a searing headache and intractable vomiting. I pulled thepatches off and started over the next day with the 25mcg. I tried the 37.5 two times_ approximately 3 weeks apart_ and had this same horrible result. Even with the 25mcg_ I am so stoned when I sit down to relax that my eyes cross and I nod out. I can't read a book or watch tv b/c of this. Very annoying! I am seeing my PM doctor this week and will tell him I really can't take the 37.5 patch b/c of the N/V_ and even wonder about the 25mcg making me impaired in general (I work in health care). I also have to say that the patch in general scares the bejeesus out of me - I worry I will go to bed and not wake up from the darn thing mis,F,49,2  months,1/12/2008,Duragesic-100

49, 4, Crohn's Disease / Degenerative Disc,Weight Loss (20lbs in 4 months) Wears off in 2 1/2 days,This is the best thing I have been on so far.  Have taken just about every pain med out there.  Was on Avinzia (time released morphine) before this and it was like taking baby aspiran.  Have Crohns / Degenerative Disc Disease / 4 Herniated Discs / Osteoperosis and I'm only 45.  This has made life much easier than taken a dozen pills a day.  With the Avinzia I was still taking 3 Percocet a day with it.  Now I only take maybe 1 5/500 Vicoden a day_ usually in the evening after work to give me a boost.  Some days I don't take any.  Now using 75 mcg patch.  Started on 25mcg for a week and it did nothing.  Then 50mcg for a month and now on 75mcg for the past 2 months.  Only problem is it starts to weart off sometimes after 2 1/2 days and that starts the withdrawal symptoms.  Restless legs and arms and chills.  Take zanaflex and vicodene to help.  Sometimes change the patch 8 hrs early.  Have been trying to time it out by changing the patch every 66hrs.  That way I only run out 1 day ahead o,M,45,4  months,9/5/2007,Duragesic-100

56, 2, Herniated Disk L4-L5,Constipation; Fatigue; irritability,My mood swings are horrible. I got pregnant and my doctor told me that it was safe to continue to use this drug while being pregnant.  Well my irritability was so bad that I would have SEVERE screaming episodes where I'd get so mad at whoever happened to be in the room.  I'd get to the point where I couldn't even breathe.  I ended up losing our baby at 18 wks pregnant because of it. I couldn't just stop taking the drug b/c of withdrawls and I had NO control over my anger. I am still on the drug and I still have so much anger.  I get so mad so easily and just scream and yell. I've never been like this before. The 3rd day is usually the worse while on this drug. The doctor really won't give me any advice on what to do. Does anyone else have this problem? If so please email me at ddifrancesco@huxcomm.net,F,36,6  months,3/30/2007Email,Duragesic-100

I also changed this patch every 48 hours or the 3rd day was not good.  This stuff will get you so addicted you will think you can never get off of it.  It took three and a half months for me to work my way of this stuff by slowly dosing down.  It was three and a half months of hell which I spent in my bedroom.  Thank God I got off of it because when I switched insurance company's they just cut me off even with the doctor recommending I had to have it.  I told them I was on it for two and a half years and just couldn't quit because of withdrawal.  They told me ""Oh well_ just go to the hospital if you start withdrawal"".
