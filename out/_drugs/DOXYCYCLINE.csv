0, 1, Sinusitus,Severe acid reflux_ stabbing stomach and esophagus pain that wakened me at 2 am and kept me awake all night in pain. No sleep at all. Constant burning in upper abdomen.,I took this with a full meal of chicken_ rice_ beans and 16 oz water at 3pm. So to be wakened at 2am in severe pain is a huge concern. I followed all the guidelines to minimize side effects and still had a horrible reaction.usually after 4 days on antibiotic you feel a little better. This stuff had zero effect on my month long sinus infection. Stopping this monster today. Hoping for relief and sleep by tonight as I take probiotics and Zantac. Get a different antibiotic!,F,40,4  days100 2X D,2/2/2015,Doxycycline
1, 5, chronic Lyme,Nausea/vomiting if I didn't take it with food; dry skin; sun sensitivity and severe sunburn if I wasn't careful.,"I have found this to be a very satisfactory long-term medication_ being easy to take_ cheap_ and safe_ and covered by insurance. It didn't cure the Lyme disease but keeps it under control so symptoms are minimal. I call it ""maintenance"" therapy.",F,67,23  years200mg 1X D,1/5/2011Email,Doxycycline
2, 3, Lyme Disease,Nausea_ which was helped if I took the pill with some rice.,The side effects of the doxy itself were tolerable; I didn't have any of the vomiting or diarrhea that a lot of people tend to get_ but I did have a Herxheimer reaction from its effect on the Lyme in the second week of treatment---I could not eat_ and could barely move_ couldn't get out of bed for an entire week. However_ after that week I started to feel a lot better and I definitely feel better than before I started the doxy.,F,22,30  days,4/6/2008,Doxycycline
3, 4, Hydradentis supurlativa,Itchy skin_ stomac problems,Cleared up facial acne and armpit infection but has not helped with HS in other places.,F,37,9  months,1/15/2008,Doxycycline
4, 4, chronic Lyme Disease,lots of nausea and occasional vomiting_ occasionally took over the counter anti-nausea meds- helped. You have to take it with food!I also got sun sensitivity_ which was pretty bad towards the end- I usually dont' sunburn easily_ and this was bad enough to be annoying.,It worked very_ very well for my chronic Lyme- I went from disabled to highly functional in two months (the treatment takes much longer than that or you will relapse_ see www.ILADS.org for more information on proper treatment). I eventually had to switch to azithromycin and then herbal treatments because of the nausea/vomiting_ but I would go back on doxy if necessary as the nausea was less of a problem than some other antibiotic side effects. This is the least serious of the antibiotics side effects I've felt while having Lyme. Some Lyme patients experience a temporary worsening of symptoms- a Herxheimer reaction- which is not a side effect but is caused by dying bacteria_ explained at the ILADS treatment guidelines website. Other patients may need different antibiotic for their chronic Lyme or a combination_ however_ no one antibiotic helps everyone with this condition. Long term treatments (even years) usually put it into remission.,F,35,90  days,5/20/2007,Doxycycline
5, 4, chronic Lyme Disease,I already described my experience but forgot to add that it's critical to not lie down for at least half an hour after taking this antibiotic or the nausea is worse_ and it can irritate the esophagus_ both of which I experienced.,,F,35, ,5/20/2007,Doxycycline
6, 1, Acne,Esophagitis_ anxiety,Be careful when taking this medicine. Be sure to drink with at least 8 oz of water and DO NOT lie down after taking this. I made the mistake of going to bed immediately after taking it one night. I have not been able to eat for two days! Major pain in my chest and back when I swallow food! It's a great antibiotic but the side effects aren't worth it,F,26,14  days,4/26/2007,Doxycycline
