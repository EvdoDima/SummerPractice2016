0, 1, Migraines,No side effects relieved my moderate migraines on two separate occasions. I tried it again when I had a high level migraine took two doses apart and it didn't do much at all. Also extremely expensive.,,M,30,3  days12.5,10/17/2013,Axert
1, 4, migraine,none,First migraine med I've taken that didn't have horrible side effects and actually helped relieve migraine pain.  The 7 day headache didn't go away_ but the medicine significantly reduced the pain enough for me to participate in and acutally enjoy day-to-day activities!,F,47,1  days12.5 mg 1X D,11/9/2011Email,Axert

3, 5, Severe migraines,None,Axert is my wonder drug.  After trying most every 'new' migraine medication out there_ my doctor finally decided to try some of the older ones.  Axert usually relieves my migraines on the first pill.  If not_ you can take a second one after one hour.  I don't go anywhere without them.,F,55,5  years12.5 1X AN,7/27/2010,Axert
