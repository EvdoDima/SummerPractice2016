0, 1, Severe pain after root canal,,It did nothing to assuage my pain. I was in agony. Why my endodontist prescribed lodine_ something meant for mild to moderate pain_ is beyond me. Ibuprophin was slightly more effective. Wrong pain reliever for my situation.,F,64,1  days400mg,3/5/2016,Lodine
1, 5, Severe back pain,None so far,Helps the pain tremendously,F,43,1  days500 mg,1/14/2016Email,Lodine
2, 5, sciatica_ bursitis_ fibromyalgia,Feeling feverish_ sweating (mostly at night). Mild gastritis.,A really good pain reliever.  Takes two or three weeks to have full effect.  As good_ for me_ as Celebrex and the generic (etodolac) is much less expensive. NSAIDS work differently for individuals and this is one of three that have worked for me.  I have probably tried at least ten different ones.,F,66,1  years2x 400 mg,10/22/2015,Lodine

4, 4, Arthritis,Dry mouth_ tiredness_ problems urinating_ laryngitis.,"I'm upset that this drug works so well for my arthritis (spine/hip). I was almost bed ridden until I took Lodine. I didn't read all the side effects_ and mine were not listed as the top ""side effects."" So_ for another week_ I kept suffering with being tired_ dry mouth that is causing me to have laryngitis. Digging deeper into the effects_ I did find mine. I'm sure my doctor will tell me ""this doesn't happen to anyone else."" That''s what they always tell me when I have problems with drugs. But I have drug sensitivity_ and seem to be the 1%.",M,60,2  weeks400 2X D,6/29/2014Email,Lodine
5, 4, Shoulder tendinitis,I started taking this for my shoulder. After they found that I only had tendinitis and no tears_ I did intense PT for months. When I felt better I decided to stop taking Lodine. Unfortunately my knee hurts excessively since I stopped. Apparently it has been bothering me and I did not notice because of the Lodine 2x per day. I had it scoped 8 years ago and the right one 6 years b4 that. Can I try to stay on Lodine long termFor my knees????,,M,44,8  months30,6/25/2013Email,Lodine
6, 4, tooth extraction,Constipation,No swelling or pain whatsoever... just constipation afterwards.,M,30,3  days400 3X D,2/21/2013Email,Lodine
7, 1, Back pain (car accident),SEVERE abdominal pain!,I was prescribed this drug to relieve back pain after a car accident.  It helps with pain.  However_ I developed abdominal pain so severe my primary care physician sent me to the ER for a CT scan to rule out appendicitis!  Interestingly_ the pain peaked several days AFTER discontinuing the medicine.  I discussed the scenario with a rheumatologist; he told me that he has observed this with etodolac (although not as often with acute usage).,M,40,2  weeks500 MG 2X D,9/19/2012,Lodine
8, 1, tooth abcess,none because i only took once WHICH WAS ENOUGH!!!,THIS IS CRAP!!  I do not take pain meds of any kind so even the smell of a pain med should work on me.  The pharmacy said this is the same as Advil.. what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I dont know what pees me off more.   the money spent for this garbage or it being garbage   DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS_  Goody's work and cheaper  GRRRRRRRRRR,F,56,1  times300 4X D,7/31/2012Email,Lodine
9, 4, Arthritis_ Spinal Stenosis Degenera,I went off it for 6 days in preparation for an epidural steroid injection.  I noticed that while I had more arthritis pain_ my appetite was decreased.  I am not as hungry when I don't take the drug. Since I am overweight and this does not help my back_ this is important for me to take into consideration.,My daughter was prescribed Etodolac for menstrual cramps and noticed that her appetite increased when she took the drug.  It works very well for her cramps_ however and since is on it intermittently_ this is not a problem.  For me_ on it twice a day every day for 7 years_ I wonder how responsible it is for my weight gain.,F,62,7  years 2X D,1/21/2011Email,Lodine
10, 3, joint pain_ sciatica_stenosis,Joint pain_ nerve tingling_ arm_ shoulder_ neck_ spine_ knee_ ankle involvement.,Lodine was the best of the NSAIDS that I tried in terms of keeping pain at bay. Mostly I did not want to move at all. After being sent for yet another MRI_ the pain changed sides and I realized it was spinal_ probably stenosis. I had gained weight and lost the joy of life_ was out of shape. I also read that taking these drugs can lead to tendon damage. Diagnosed as Vitamin D seriously deficient_ I supplemented with D_ fish oil_ calcium_ glucosamine_ chondroitin msm and multi vitamin. I started aquatic exercise_ hoping it would not hurt. In two weeks I was down to one pill a day_ in a month to none. I have lost 20 lbs and am on weight watchers and am taking kung fu classes--don't laugh. In all_ holistic approach is working. The answer is not found in just a drug.,F,60,2  years 2X D,12/8/2010,Lodine
11, 5, bad back pain_ knee_ fibromyalgia,constipation (take magnesium)_ stomach burning (get scrip for carafate),I have taken this drug on and off for 15 plus years_ after trying naproxen_ naprosyn_ ibuprofen_ and many other nsaids. I have extreme spinal stenosis and am on heavy duty narcotics also but they did little for the arthritis in my knee and other joints. I have found I do best with this nsaid_ it takes the pain away and it works quickly_ it doesn't take weeks to really take away the pain.  I tried Lyrica_ Savella_ and Cymbalta for fibromyalgia_ and had terrible side effects_ the doctor said these drugs would help the fibromyalgia but I didn't find that to be true_ I couldn't get past the side effects long enough to find out if they would help or not.  I have discovered that I need to take a drug called carafate (sucralfate) before I take the Lodine for my stomach this drug coats the stomach (it is sort of like chalk) and doesn't seem to have much in the way of side effects for me.  For the constipation I do well with taking 400 mg of magnesium (the basis of milk of magnesia) at night_ every night(I graduated up to this amount). Occasionally I have to take a stool softener too_ because the narcotics I take also cause constipation.  The only reason I stopped taking Lodine was that I had atrial fibrillation and they put me on coumadin and the doc said I couldn't be on a drug that thinned the blood like Lodine.  I have since had heart surgery and had a procedure that ended the afib.  Now I am back on the Lodine hip hip hooray,F,62,15  years400 mg 2X D,6/5/2010Email,Lodine
12, 1, general arthritic pain,Had severe skin rash breakout from just one pill. Red rash with discoid charasteristics.  Took me several episosdes to figure this out. Took 8 weeks of prednisone to calm it down.,"I have been diagnosed with SCLE Lupus.  This reaction is making me feel possibly I have ""drug induced Lupus.""  Have had similar reaction to Plaquenil.  Have not found anyone else with this reaction to Etodolac.  If you have had this reaction please post a comment.  My husband takes this all the time with great sucess for back pain.  I posted a 1 because of my response.  I never expected this reaction.",F,60,1  days400 mg 1X D,3/3/2010Email,Lodine
13, 3, tooth pain,stomach pain and watery stools,my sciatica is gone while i have been on this pain med and the tooth pain is gone.. the stomach pain and watery stools have made me miss work.,F,26,2  days,2/3/2010,Lodine
14, 2, osteoarthritis: back_ fingers_ toes,I wound up with either severe gastritis or an ulcer and am now on medication for that and a bland diet till the stomach pain is gone.,Lodine is the best ever for absolutely wiping out arthritic pain. With Vicodin_ I settle for mild pain to avoid taking to many narcotics. Unfortunately_ I have developed probably an ulcer from the Lodine_ and have had problems with previous attempts to take Lodine. With a history of ulcers_ this is no surprise_ but very sad since Lodine completely resolved the arthritic pain.,F,62,4  days,4/1/2009,Lodine
15, 5, Arthritis,Warm body; always warmer than others in a room.  When not taking it_ body temperature is cooler. ALWAYS take with food_ never on empty stomach.  No drowsyness_ no stomach upset_ no dry mouth.,This is a great anti-inflammatory and works on bursitis pain_ knee pain_ facet joint pain_ heal spur pain.  Costs less than $24 for 60 (cheap generic).  When I have to go off this_ my body hurts so much I can barely move.  Replaced expensive Celebrex.  About the same in pain relief.  This medication must be discontinued about 2 days before surgery because of it's affect on the blood just like other NSAIDS (aspirin_ etc.).,F,59,6  years,6/10/2008,Lodine
16, 2," Plantar fascitiis or ""heel spurs""",Bad constipation_ a little drowsiness after about 1 hour but not enough to go to sleep.  Still_ I would not drive after taking it.,It did not help.  And why do so many NSAI drugs make you so freaking constipated???? Thank God for Metamucil.  I took 400mg twice a day.,F,46,2  weeks,6/5/2008,Lodine

18, 4, Sciatic Pain_ Back Pain,Mild flushing_ more vivid dreams_ water retention_ very mild headache.,"I too was having nightmares on Naprosyn. Nightmares were almost always about having a screaming match with someone over what I can't say. Doctor looked up side-effects and said that was NOT one of them_ but switched me to Lodine (Etodolac).  Nightmares went away. Was also taking Skelaxin during the day for muscle spasms (Flexeril was too sedative for day time usage).  Also 5mg Vicodin as needed.  Company switched insurances_ and new doctors first comments on my prescription was ""What weird kind of Kaiser Cocktail is Etodolac and Skelaxin""? and wouldn't prescribe the Skelaxin... but_ he DID up my vicodin prescript from the 20 at a time I was getting with Kaiser with 0 refills to *60* at a time with *3* refills... I have more than one friend who became heavily addicted to vicodin_ so one 60 tablet refill lasts me 6-8 months.",M,41,18  months,12/14/2007,Lodine
19, 4, L5 compression/sciatica,Slight flushing in the ears and a very_ very low grade headache in the scalpula (more of a tension in the muscles then an actual headache).,"Had been taking Naprosyn.  By experimentation_ found out that was causing very vivid nightmares (almost to night terror levels).  First night off of Nap on on Lodine_ *dreams* were as vivid as the nightmares_ but *not disturbing*. Greatly reduced sciatica pain_ but didn't relieve general aches in the back (related to my muscles attempting to ""re-adjust"" their function to automatically compensate).  As a result_ my regular walking gait is ""different"" (however_ I just traded trucks with my partner for a week_ and am now driving a clutch instead of an automatic).  Also just tried Skelaxin for the first time tonite_ and am AMAZED at the relief this has provided_ in addition to the Lodine.  For the first time in years_ I can pretty much ""jump up"" from my chair at the computer_ walk around the house_ back straight_ no pain_ do regular duties (dishes_ bend over to pick up the cat's bowls_ everything (mildly_ so far ---I'm not pushing it!) I used to do coming home",M,40,1  days,4/10/2007Email,Lodine
