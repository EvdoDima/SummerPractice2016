0, 1, Seasonal allergies,I started having awful headaches after starting Flonase.  I also had some under eye muscle twitching and anxiety making it difficult to sleep at night.  It's definitely better to blow my nose 100 times a day than to deal with all those side effects.  Will not be taking another dose.,,F,42,10  days,8/15/2016,Flonase

2, 2, sinus congestion,post-nasal drip_ shakiness_ insomnia_ sinus symptoms getting worse,Only took my second dose this morning_ although after taking the first yesterday_ my sinus congestion got worse.  Nothing has changed from the way it was before_ where I thought the drug would help.  I was leery of taking it because I hate using drugs for anything.  Already there's some post-nasal drip_ which is exactly I didn't want to take it.  Also_ I hardly slept last night (although to be honest_ my sleep has been poor since my sinus problems began 6 months ago)_ and I'm shaky and agitated this morning.,F,67,2  days50 1X D,7/28/2016Email,Flonase

5, 1, Seasonal allergies,"PLEASE READI felt so alone in this at first but after doing some research_ I can see there are more and more people suffering from side effects as I did and still am. I started taking Flonase for seasonal allergies for about two months until I had my first ""anxiety attack"".  It was very intense and I have no idea what was going on so I called an ambulance and took a trip to the emergency room. They  diagnosed me with anxiety and prescribed me anxiety medication and it made me feel worse. 6 trips to the ER later_ I finally got to see my family doctor. (Btw  every doctor I had seen before this completely overlooked Flonase as being the culprit)  so this time before seeing my doctor I did a little research and found out that various people around the world are having severe side effects from Flonase that goes undiagnosed.  Chances are that you have been using it incorrectly and just jamming it up your nose and spraying away and going about your day. But This is where things get a little unclear. Technically when you're using Flonase you're supposed to spray  at the interlinings of the beginning of your nostril (in an outwards direction) NOT  into your nasal cavity. This  is where it gets scary. If you spray into your nasal cavity nine times out of 10 the drainage will take the Flonase to the back of your throat and you will then swallow it into your stomach . THIS IS WHERE THE DAMAGE IS DONE.  The steroid then begins to damage not only your esophagus but the inte",Although the product works very well definitely read the warnings and side effects before using and do not swallow any of it .,M,26,2  months2xD,7/23/2016Email,Flonase
6, 1, For allergies,Flonase definitely helped when I used it. I could breathe and not have any allergy issues. I always had a runny nose though when using it. I finally decided I did not want to be on ANY drugs at all_ so I stopped using it. Plus I had no insurance to cover the cost_ so I quit getting it. Now I have constant sinus blockage. One side or the other is ALWAYS BLOCKED. My sinuses block up if I laugh_ when I lay down etc. My sinuses are not the same since using FLONASE. Obviously the steroid has damaged my sinuses. Never again will I trust a doctor or their stupid medicines they push on us.,,F,59,5  years30 mg 2X D,7/19/2016Email,Flonase
7, 1, Sore throat caused by post nasal,A short time after using Flonase I started to feel very anxious_ disoriented_ jittery and more. I bolted out of a store and hoped that I would make it home without going to the ER. Major panicky and disoriented feelings.,It was the same feelings I had when I  once was on prednisone for a week. If you can't take cortisone stay away. It's horrible. I'll never take this again.,F,59,1  days50 mcg.,7/18/2016,Flonase

9, 2, Sinus inflammation due to allergy,Bad Fatigue_ mild leg cramps_ weakness_ nausea. Steroids usually tire me so this is no exception. But it did help with my sinus symptoms but not worth the side affects. Better to use a netti pot with distilled water only and the salt packs that are sold with them.,The adverse affects need to be mentioned on balance with the good. This does not stay local but is absorbed through the blood vessels and skin thus affecting the entire body.,M,54,3  days50 mcg per,7/10/2016Email,Flonase

Never had anything like this happen to me before.  Still feeling this way hope it goes away soon.  Threw it away will never take again.,Actually  took it for one week it was great felt fine it worked.  Few weeks later took it again for 3 days when this happened.  It's  the only new thing in my life so it has to be the Flonase plus other have the same reaction.,F,47,3  days,7/2/2016,Flonase
12, 1, Vasomotor Rhinitis,I started this nasal spray 3 years ago. It worked awesome for the three years. On May 24_ 2016 I started to have severe stomach pain_ cramping and nausea that brought me to ER three times in the past 30 days and EXSTENSIVE specialists and testing that showed nothing was wrong w/me. I stopped medicine 4 days ago and I'm soooo much better. If you use this spray and notices weird symptom side effects_ I suggest you go off for 1 week and see if it's due to this spray.,,F,52,3  years,6/30/2016Email,Flonase

14, 2, Constant nasal congestion,As soon as I started using Flonase I lost my ability to sleep. Felt very nervous and anxious all the time_ like something inside me was going to explode. I thought I was losing my mind until I figured out Flonase is a steroid and that was probably what was causing my issues. It does work great for allergies. Completely eliminated my allergy symptoms. But I can't take it because of the side effects.,,M,48,3  weeks50 mcg,6/21/2016Email,Flonase

I have been frightened_ has insomnia_ felt like my heart was beating out of my chest...and cried to my wife on a nightly basis.This morning I made the connection between my incredible anxiety and the beginning of this medication.I couldn't go to work today and just sat and detoxed.I feel so badly....for the past 6 days I've been a horrible husband_ father and therapist...sitting like a zombie in session.In glad to know that I'm not losing my mind.,NEVER AGAIN!I can't wait to get this crap out of my system and get on with my life!!,M,49,5  days,6/15/2016Email,Flonase

I also experienced bouts of crying_ snapping at my family_ anger_ nervousness_ racing thoughts_ not able to sleep well.  My joints hurt and my body is very stiff.,"I have been off of this POISON for a week now and am STILL suffering the side effects.  If anything_ they are going away in tiny amounts each day.  This drug is a steroid and can build up in your system.  If you take an asthma inhaler_ you are getting a ""double dose"" of the steroids.  The side effects will creep up on you and then BAM!  After being off of it for a week I am now experiencing tingling on my left side in my hand_ foot and left side of my face and I don't know why.  Praying that this all goes away soon.

My husband informed me that Flonase is the same family as cocaine_ the reason it's only recommended for no more than two months.   Second day_ heartache again.,And funny thing is it hasn't eliminated my allergies/symptoms but added issues to the list. I will not use it again_ don't like messing with my heart.,F,43,2  days2,5/23/2016Email,Flonase

I had a miserable allergy day so thought I would try again and the anxiety came back almost immediately.  i have been ""clean"" for 2 weeks now and am feeling amazing after 2 years of searching for a reason for my anxiety and taking serious meds to get to sleep.  Now a cup of herbal tea does the trick.  I am amazed that the spray was all I had to change!",After talking to others_ I think the anxiety issue needs to be at the top of the side effects list and more research needs to be done to determine the effect of long term use of steroid nasal sprays especially since we are now perscribing them to children.,F,56,2.5  years1 spray 1X D,5/22/2016Email,Flonase
31, 1, Seasonal Allergies,I have used Flonase in past years with no problems. I've been using for about two weeks now and noticed that about 30 minutes after taking it my eyes get horribly itchy and burning. Enough that several times I've had to flush with water (I thought maybe just laundry detergent or something?). When I looked it up and saw this site_ I realized all of the other weird things I've been feeling the last two weeks were on here also! Namely_ extreme tiredness during the day and unable to sleep at night. Which is what has probably cause my not-so-normal persistent moodiness/attitude.,It definitely helps with allergies_ but to me the side effects I get aren't worth it!,F,31,2  weeks4 sp 1x dy,5/21/2016,Flonase

36, 5, Alllergies,No side effects noticed.,Personally_ I think a lot of folks that post here are hypochondriacs. This nasal spray could not possibly cause all of the issues being blamed on it.

37, 1, Potential sinus problem,EXTREME Anxiety_ massive headache for days,So I had been having sinus issues for almost literally the past month.  Had 3 ER visits for severe sinus pressure and 3 (unproductive) Dr. visits.  One of the ER Doctors put me on flonase_ so I took that and the first day I immediately had a headache on the entire left side of my head.  On top of that_ later that night I was eating dinner then all of a sudden I was sweating profusely_ my heart was racing and I was having short breaths.  I had to leave the restaurant and I realized that I was having some sort of panic attack.  After I had calmed down_ the headache was still lingering and lasted for about 2 additional days (and yes_ I was taking ibuprofen) before it finally subsided_ but it left me with my head feeling heavier than it did before.,M,23,1  days30 mg 2X D,5/6/2016Email,Flonase

It really helped my allergies_ but the side effects from the medicine aren't worth it. I will find holistic ways to deal with my allergies including going on a food elimination diet in order to weed out a potential food sensitivity. I was scared I was losing my sense of smell_ but I wonder if others could benefit from an anti fungal for an infection in the nose?
