0, 5, Hysterectomy,The only problem I have is with the adesive_ but I have a problem with all adhesives.  I gladly deal with that to use Vivelle.,Vivelle prevents hot flashes_ mood swings_ and migraines.  After my hysterectomy I wasn't given any hormones_ which sent me into the worst cycle of migraines that could not be controlled.  After a neurologist in Memphis_ Dr. Deshazo got them somewhat under control_ he worked with Dr. Hargrove_ a specialist at Vanderbilt who prescribed the Vivelle patch.  It was and is a lifesaver for me.,,,20  years 2X W,10/24/2013Email,Vivelle

3, 1, menopause,got ZERO absorption compared to Estraderm patch which was discontinued by Novartis. More than half of my patients got no response either. Filed complaint with Novartis and FDA. Wore Estraderm patch for 23 years with no problems. RIP Estraderm. Am now using Evamist. Absorption excellent.,WASTE OF MONEY! Pharmaceutical fraud!,F,57,30  days0.1 mg pat 2X W,5/7/2012Email,Vivelle
4, 5, severe hot flashes and insomnia,the only side effect for me is back pain but versus the severe hot flashes and night sweats I will take back pain any day,,F,49, unknown 2X W,3/4/2011,Vivelle
5, 4, Post-op uterine septum resection,Some insomnia in the beginning_ otherwise nothing_ still concerned if it's working as I am not feeling ANY different :),,F,29,23  days0.1mg/day 2X W,9/3/2010Email,Vivelle
6, 4, hormone replacement,none,stopped mebopausal effects such as hot flashes etc had total hysterectomy at age 31,F,36,60  days1.5 1X D,7/13/2010,Vivelle
7, 4, Menopause,none,Sensitive to adhesives but no problem so far. Bloating and digestive issues are diminishing and memory lapses_leg pain and hot flashes are gone.Sleep is much better. No migraines since starting the Vivelle Dot. I have a feeling the Vivelle Dot would have eliminated all my premenstrual headaches too. I've used BHRT with progesterone and just progesterone alone but I had weight gain_ depression and puffiness  using progesterone and it did nothing for my migraines. Finally decided to try BHRT without progesterone and that has made all the difference for me.,F,57,4  weeks.05mg 2X W,5/21/2010,Vivelle
8, 1, Menopause,Joint Pain in feet and hands.,"Started Estradiol/Prometrium 6/2007_ noticed syptoms within 2 weeks_ pain in feet. Stopped taking medication. Consulted with Dr. ""absolutely no connection"" was her response. Consulted with PCP ""absolutely no connection"". A year later still experiencing joint pain. I was totally healthy and pain-free prior to taking this medication. Beware!",F,48,21  days,7/20/2008,Vivelle
9, 5, Hysterectomy,None,I recently had a complete hysterectomy due to a tumor and many cysts on my ovaries. I was having a lot of cronic pain in my side_ heavy periods_ headaces and mood swings. Since my surgery all of this has gone away_ It was the best thing I ever did! The patch is very easy to wear and keep up with_ I would recommend it to anybody!,F,38,2  months,4/27/2008,Vivelle
10, 5, Hysterectomy,None,The Vivelle dot is fantastic.  I had a complete hysterectomy in 2002 and went on the patch pretty quickly after.  It nipped the hot flashes_ sleeplessness_ anxiety_ and night sweats in the bud; my sex life is great; and my husband has noticed that I seem to be more even-keeled_ moodwise.  I started at .1 mg. and am now at .5 and am still doing fine.  That and the hysterectomy has improved my quality of life immensely.  I have had problems with my periods since the day they started--very heavy bleeding_ clots_ extreme pain_ sometimes almost fainting_ terrible mood swings_ pain during/after sex_ pain even when not on my period. I had a complete hysterectomy and was found to have endometriosis_ adenomyosis_ and generally a messed-up reproductive system.  I am now pain free and enjoy my life ALL of the days of the month!  For me_ the hysterectomy and going on the Vivelle patch enhanced the quality of my life immensely!,F,53,4  years,4/20/2007,Vivelle
11, 5, hysterectomy,I was on this for 13 years and toward the end of my use of it_ developed a little redness around the patch. I would still be on it if not for that fact and the scare of breast cancer from using hormone replacement.,I was very pleased.  I did gain weight_ but I cannot swallow a pill and this was excellent.  I was on this from 1991-2004. It adheres very well and feels most like your skin. Also_ you do not have to worry about the increased chance of gall bladder problems with this patch.,F,65,13  years,3/17/2007,Vivelle
12, 5, perimenopause,Some breast enlargement and a small degree of breast tenderness.  This was not problematic.,"The patch is very small and barely noticeable against your skin.  It adheres extremely well. I found it to be most effective when changed every 72 hours. Alleviated perimenopausal symptoms within first week: hot flashes_ night sweats_ bloating_ ""mind fog""_ and irritability. Also noticed a marked decrease in appetite/food cravings.  I am currently using the 0.025mg Vivelle patch in conjuntion with 100mg Prometrium capsule on days 1 through 12 of each month (for uterine protection).",F,41,2  months,7/11/2006,Vivelle
13, 5, diminished ovarian reserve,Vivelle dot best patch to take overall.  Other patches don't stick as well and the size of vivelle is small. Would recommend changing every 3 days instead of the 3 1/2 days that is recommended in instruction insert.,,F,37,8  months,6/29/2006,Vivelle
