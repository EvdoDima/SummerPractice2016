0, 4, Ankylosing Spondylitis,Occasional dizziness_ almost feel hung over_ but without drinking. Don't know if it's the Enbrel_ or just getting used to not being on ibuprofen all the time. Skin doesn't seem as healthy as before_ zits don't heal as fast.,I am doing things I couldn't do before. Driving long distances_ lifting objects_ strenuous yard work. I've even stopped taking drops for my recurrent iritis. The Enbrel is working great at stopping the AS. However_ I don't feel physically at the top of my game_ and I don't know why.,M,54,3  months50mg 1X W,8/12/2016,Enbrel

2, 3, RA,Diagnosed with RA 8 months ago.  Started with Xeljanz but worked well for 3 months only. I followed a strict diet of eating only good foods for like leafy vegetable_deep sea fish and fruits.  Took 3 caps turmeric daily_ Kefir and  accupuncture. Actually_ before I started with embrel my ESR was down to 35 from 39. I Just had 2 shots of embrel 25mg so I don't see the difference yet. I refrained from Salt_ sugar_ red meats_ preserve meats and all foods bad for RA. I did my own research_ doctors are maybe busy to guide patients on this but really all these help.

I didn't want to commence with either of these drugs_ as I have avoided drugs all my adult life. However after reading all the literature available to me_ I did commence and the pain of RA has diminished.

5, 1, RA PAIN AND DEFORMITY OF JOINTS,It has helped the pain but the rash and starts immediately after injection have tried everything but always get a rash that lasts 2 to 3 weeks.  Call Embrel and they are no help the nurses just read the instructions to me.  Well I know how to read_ I want to know why the rashes and why do they take so long to clear.  The HELL with what Embrel states;  if you have a skin reaction it will clear up in 3 to 7 days_ in reality it clears up in 5 to 8 weeks.,They could have better nurses that actually have experience in doing injections.  And are able to give rational and informed communication.,F,70,2  months50 1X W,5/12/2016,Enbrel

8, 1, Rheumatoid arthritis,Was on Humira for about a year until the sinus infections became so bad I took myself off  dr. suggested Enbrel . Was taking it for about four months  _  my last injection left my leg swollen itchy   Which wasn't a big problem for me  it went away in a few days . It's been probably three weeks since my last injection _ I've called my dr to  find another remedy .  I'm short of breath coughing having night sweats  and just all-around miserable . Biologics just aren't for me ..  Since I've been off the injection I'm feeling very stiff and sore  but I'm also dealing with chest congestion possible lung infection . At this point I'm just afraid of the Biologics .  I can't deal with being deathly ill   99% of the time .,,F,50,3  months,4/7/2016Email,Enbrel
9, 5, Ankylosing Spondylitis,Slow skin healing_ easy discoloration,I had a positive experience with Enbrel from my first injection... No injection-site reactions or other side effects... I experienced noticeable improvement in SI_ neck_ and hip pain after 2 injections_ with continued improvement.  After several months I noticed slower wound healing_ and discoloration after a cut or breakout had healed.  With the reduction in pain_ my stress decreased_ I was able to increase exercise & stretching_ sleep more_ bring inflammation down_ and stop using the Enbtel after a year and a half.  I discontinued using it without tapering- listened to my body_ and stopped when I felt I was ready.  A couple things I found helpful from the beginning: to utilize breathing & relaxation techniques just before & during each injection_ and to inject into a fleshy area of my upper thigh.,F,47,18  months50mg 1X W,3/22/2016,Enbrel
10, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Very slight injection location rash which no longer happens,Was very apprehensive about being told by my Rheumy that my psoriatic arthritis was quite severe and that I should take this drug. I also hated the idea of having to inject myself. However_ since I started taking this drug 4 months ago_ after an initial 4/6 weeks_ the main side effect is that I feel great. The chronic foot and back pain is gone. The muscle pain and general fatigue is also in the past. I didn't realise how badly I was affected by my arthritis until the Enbrel took effect. Time will tell how effective this is and if I get any nasty side effects_ but for now_ this is truly a miracle drug for me.,M,50,4  months50mg 1X W,3/5/2016Email,Enbrel

Recently I have been getting dizzy and was just wondering if it had something to do with the medication_ that's why I am on this site. Trying to learn the long term effects from your experiences.,I had severe pain in my joints for three 3 years prior to being on Enbrel. It improved the quality of my life.

22, 4, RA,Burning with injections. I prefer prefilled syringes versus the auto inject. I can control how fast to give it to myself. I do get erythema at the injection sites for about 3-4 days after injection. I'm also on Methotrexate injection  weekly. I started about 3 wks ago with a headache to my forehead_ cheeks radiating into my jaws and posterior neck.  These start about 2 days after the injection and lasts about 2-3 days. I notice they start in the evening and cause severe nausea. They kind of knock me down for a while. I have a history of migraine  headaches_  so I initially thought it was the headaches coming back again. After a lot of research _ I now realize it's a side effect of the Enbrel.,I have experienced moderate relief of the pain to my hands and feet.? It used to hurt so bad to step on the floor in the mornings_  or to make a fist or hold a pen. Those symptoms have improved and a intermittent. I'm  thankful for the relief I've experienced.  I'm praying the headaches will subside over time and I can continue on Enbrel. I am disappointed with the minimal information on the Amgen website regarding headaches. They don't inform on the severity of these and how debilitating they can be. I'm hanging unto the Enbrel train though_  until theres a need to change. Remember: research_ inquire_ study and learn all you can about your illness. Be sure the info is Reputable!! Arming yourself with knowledge keeps you in control of your body. Prayers and hugs to all.??,F,47,7  weeks50mg 1X W,1/11/2016,Enbrel

28, 1, psoriatic arthritis,I really thought I was going to die. I only did 2 injections. My overall condition got worse. I developed rashes that a dermatologist is still trying to figure out. I developed weakness that I never had. I was so sick overall. This is going on two months and I'm wondering if I will ever recover from this. I know these drugs may work for some people but I wish I would have never tried this. One injection of Humira had a similar effect. I have decided that I will not take anything that supresses the immune system ever again including steroids. I will do as much as I can naturally. This was very dangerous for me. I believe I may have had an underlying condition and Enbrel made it worse by lowering immunity. I am interested if anyone knows how to recover from this.,,M,46,2  weeks50mg,11/27/2015Email,Enbrel
29, 3, RA,My Rheumy doubled the Enbrel doze to 100mg weekly because of pain_ then l  developed  severe heart burn ( too long a story to get into but missed 6 weeks of work) which resulted in long term issue. Now must take life long low dose old fashioned anti depressant for heartburn issue.Recently caught severe virus with flu like symptoms_ severe cough_ bronchitis then sinus infection_ my first. I assume with a weakened and supressed immune system if I continue taking Enbrel I'll continue to get sick and just can not afford this pattern. Not sure I want to go back on Enbrel.

Absolutely fantastic BUT now experiencing severe side effects.

33, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis,No side effects because I use the powder vials 25mg 2x/wk because they don't burn.  The powder and diluent has to be mixed prior to injection.  It's a very fine needle injection.  Much better than the auto injector.If using the auto injector at 50mg 1x/wk it burns and gives an injection site reaction from the preservative in it. If using the prefilled syringe at 50 mg 1x/wk_ it's not as bad and only stings. Again from the preservative. ,It works.I take it without methotrexate.,F,50,7  years25mg 2x wk,10/1/2015,Enbrel

37, 2, RA,After the 1st dose_ I thought Enbrel was my miracle but after the second dose I experienced extreme nauseas for 4 days. I called my RA doc who wanted me to discontinue next dose of methotrexate and Enbrel then take next dose of Enbrel by itself. That night I had the nausea but next morning things seemed fine. I had slight confusion through the morning and felt 'burned' by the sun when I took students outside. I ended up losing conscience and  having extreme confusion (maybe a seizure) over the next 2-3 hours. Went to er_ had normal MRI and CT_ blood sugar and cell counts but still felt confusion_ inability to make my body respond to mental commands_ difficulty speaking words that I wanted to say (mentally not physically). After 2 days I was still having nausea even with drinking water and now it's been 3 days and I'm still drinking Boost (no appetite) and still some brain fog.

My ra doctor agreed and is looking for alternate drug.  I knew something was wrong with my health but had no idea it was enbrel doing the damage.

Went to a couple of dermatologists and was put on high doses of prednisone which made me crazy and my family fear my wrath. Lol. Those of you who have had the roid rage understand. They just said it was eczema.  RA doctor did not know what rash was either. Finally the rash got so bad went to another dermatologist who was (is) amazing and biopsied rash. Thank goodness she discovered I had a severe staph infection. (presently going through this.  If i hadn't gone to her I could have been hospitalized. I think after long term use it may cause infections. Don't know why this just started to happen. I'm going to call Enbrel's hotline and inform them. Going to find new RA doctor and stop Enbrel.

41, 5, RA,In the first four weeks_ I had injection site swelling and itching--but that no longer happens.  I am fatigued for a couple of days after the injection.  Headaches--but they're not as severe as when I first started the drug.  I had a root canal about two months into the treatment_ and still have pain and inflammation at the tip of that tooth.  My dentist has seen that happen with other patients who are on some type of biologic.,This is a miracle drug for me.  I had used Arava for months_ with absolutely no relief.  For over a year_ I was in excruciating pain; I was unable to use my hands; couldn't make a fist; and I broke my foot twice from dropping a pot onto it!  Three days after my first injection_ I could use my hands again!  The swelling was gone within a week and I no longer had pain in any of my joints.

I even stopped my prednisone which i could never go a day without and really didnt help a hole lot but was able to bare through work.2 weeks after 2nd injection i suddenly woke up with a large painful soft ball size red rash at both injections sites. Very itchy and painful and warm to touch. That night i had chills_  hot one minute and soaking wet and freezing the next also have body aches and severe nausea & vomitting and a headache since reaction. I went to my md and they are doing blood work and urinalysis. I dont know if i have the flu or its from the injection. Kinda weird i suddenly reacted with a rash then got sick 9 hours later. Guess i will see what happens.,Im very nervous of taking my next injection after reading some of these reveiws but wow i cant beleive it worked so quickly.

So even though I personally don't see a ""miracle"" to my pain_ it HAS TO BE HELPING me.  My hair loss is major since starting Enbrel.  I have purchased a wig for a backup as I lose huge amounts everyday when brushing my hair out.  I have to ""catch"" the hair doesn't go down the drains as way too much falling out and definitely would cause a clogged drain!!!  Hoping for a miracle!!!

I ensure the medicine sits out at least 30 minutes before injection to ease the sting. Occasionally I will have a flare up but it does not last. I was skeptical about starting a biologics after reading about the many side effects. But I trusted my doctor had weighed the benefits to the possible side effects. Also I took it upon myself to read as much as possible about the disease & the medications.
