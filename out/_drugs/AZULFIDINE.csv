0, 4, Crohn's Disease arthritis,Acid reflux,It has done more for my Crohn's arthritis than Asacol_ 6mp_ or Entocort ever did.

2, 3, Crohns,Had positive experience the first week taking it 2x per day along with folic acid. During the 2nd week_ dosage was increased to 3x per day. Began feeling first symptoms of dizziness within 5 days of taking 3x per day. Continued feeling dizziness over the next couple days. Dosage was increased to 4x per day. Ceased taking medication as dizziness was getting too difficult to deal with after only taking 4x per day for 2 days. Also had brightly colored urine_ possibly pain/discomfort in the kidney area_ and still having some slight bouts of dizziness even after being off medication for one full week.,,M,32,3  weeks500 mg 4X D,6/3/2014Email,Azulfidine

19, 1, Ulcerative colitis,Very painful urination,I've had uc for over 40 years. My gastroenterologist started me on it originally and I suffered through many summers. I was very active and sweated a lot and if I didn't drink  an abnormal amount of liquids_ I would urinate very painful orange urine. It was so bad that I stopped taking it on a maintenance basis and just used prednisolone enemas when I had flareups for many years. I eventually went to a different doctor who prescribed Asacol. What a God-send! No side effects and no more painful urination problems. Anyone having problems with azulfidine should try Asacol. Another plus_ the Asacol tabs are smaller. Whenever I get a rarely occuring flareup now_ I use Rowasa enemas for a couple weeks and I'm back to remission. Good luck to all!,M,64,10  years,11/8/2006,Azulfidine

22, 4, RA,,Though I feel better taking this medication_ after reading the other postings_ I am a little concerned about my dosage.  My rheumatologist has me taking 4000 mg a day (8 en-tabs).

23, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis,None,Took 2000mg for two years and am now on 1000mg a day. I take the enteric coated tabs.

27, 2, psoriatic arthritis,Major nausea_ reflux_ vomiting.,I tried the azulfidine en-tabs as they are suppose to have less gastro side effects_ the side effects were too much for me at this time. Perhaps my dosage was too high to begin with. ( 1000 mg) I will try it again in the future starting at a lower dosage ( 500 mg ) and work up to 2g per day (2000 mg) over a four week period. Also on other medication which may have attributed to the gastro effects.,F,45,7  days,11/18/2003,Azulfidine
