0, 1, GERD,Where should I start with my side effects: my cardiologist prescribed for GERD on 2/11 I started taking 2/12. I was also taking amitriptyline for migraines so when my head started to feel like it would explode I thought it was from the amitriptyline so I casled the neurologist to have another meds prescribed. My symptoms started with terrible headaches_ anxiety my head feels like it's about to explode_ my heart feels like it's about to stop beating and I can't sleep I'm afraid to fall asleep.when I lie on my back it's worst very terrifying experience. Couple of weeks ago I had to go to ER I was taking me drool so I tought the sh owners from that. They kept me overnight said I was fine_ my cardiologist checked out my ekg said I was fine. At the time I didn't think anything of the protonix. Then I came to this site and read people are experiencing the same symptoms like me. My head feels like it's going to explode from the pressure.
