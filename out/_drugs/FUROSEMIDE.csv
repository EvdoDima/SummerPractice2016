0, 5, Fluid Retention,I haven't experienced anything but BETTER overall feelings of well being and my health is slowly coming back AFTER HCTZ decimated it!,I was given HCTZ for fluid retention.  Supposedly_ the fluid in my chest was respiratory related at all_ but according to the genius doc who prescribed it to me_ it would manage the rattle and wheezing I was having at night while trying to sleep!  HCTZ_ in a matter of weeks_ had me going from feeling my vibrant 42 years_ to a very lethargic 92!!!!!  I had no energy for anything!!!  I work in an elementary school and I could barely walk the halls_ barely leave the lot from my car to the school_ without my legs feeling like they would buckle under me.  My breathing was out of control.  A coworker heard my gasping for air and I nearly scared her half to death!  I have a 5 year old son_ very active_ couldn't move off the couch if I tried!  All store errands stopped and were met with agony!  I had to have a shopping basket to lean on and even grab to_ just to make it through ONE isle of shopping!  HCTZ also affected my sleeping terribly!  While I know different meds work differently on different people_ I am IN LOVE WITH FUROSEMIDE (Lasix)!!!!  Just two days on this and I am already feeling like ME again!  I got out of my car this morning_ walked around the school halls_ and no breathlessness_ NO leg pain_ and no breathing like I needed an oxygen tank!  It's a shame that I had to take measures to advance my own health positively_ because my QUACK kept telling me that none of this was the HCTZ.  Mind you_ I'm not a pill popper_ and I never had any of the symptoms I had until th,F,43,2  days20 1X AN,4/8/2014Email,Furosemide
