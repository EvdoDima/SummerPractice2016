1, 3, ADHD,Drowsiness_ Crash,Have taken pretty much every ADHD medicine and was really excited to finally get Focalin XR. Focalin IR tablets work fantastic for me (5 or 10mg 3x or 4x/day) and was really looking for an extended release version of d-MPH..My biggest problem with this medication is not that it doesnt work_ it does. It is that it lasts only 3.5 hours... Then I crash super hard and get incredibly drowsy. Have tried a few doses too and the same thing happens. Also_ I am not sure why 5mg of Focalin IR feels like 3 times stronger than 15mg Focalin XR. I cant stay on this med because I need more than 3.5 hours of coverage_ and do not feel comfortable taking 50+ mg of d-MPH to get it.,M,27,2  weeks25 1X D,5/26/2013,Focalin xr
2, 5, ADHD,Loss of appetite which causes low blood sugar which causes tantrums.  Otherwise_ an amazing_ life changing drug for our child.,"This drug has allowed my dear daughter to go from being thought of as a ""problem child"" in school to getting all 100%+ days.  Her self esteem is soaring and she can control herself which was impossible before.  The only problem is the lack of appetite which leads to tantrums from low blood sugar.  We will take this over the rages and daily trauma she had to deal with prior.",F,9,6  months25 mg 1X D,1/27/2013,Focalin xr
3, 5, ADHD,Slightly jittery and does slightly increase my anxiety level.,Amazing med! I've tried so many stimulants and couldn't tolerate them. This works so well for me_ helps me to wake up/stay focused/think clearly_ I'm very relieved to finally have this in my arsenal of items for self care. NOTE: My son who is 7 also takes this and is doing very well.,F,43,3  months15mg 1X D,10/4/2012Email,Focalin xr
4, 5, ADHD,1) Intermittent stomach pain even when taken with food_ 2) difficulty falling asleep managed with melatonin 1 mg 30-40 mins before bed._ 3) much quieter_ more reserved and serious (less personality)_ which  may be resulting in fewer friendships_ 4) definite decrease in appetite during lunch_ which I counteract by giving him more calories at breakfast (including protein) and at dinner - continues to make gains in weight & height at each checkup.,Of all the meds we've tried_ Focalin XR has worked the best.  My son has earned straight E's (Excellent) in 1st grades for last 3 grading periods & positive behavior reports (I implemented a simple system with teacher to get daily feedback). Qualified for the gifted program although he was never the best test-taker in the past.  My only complaint is that it only lasts 5 hours. We added short-acting Focalin (not XR) in the afternoon & that has caused terrible rebound irritability (weepiness or anger/defiance) that got worse over time: was once every couple of weeks_ then weekly_ then daily.  We're switching to 2 doses of Focalin XR. Problems with other meds we've tried: Concerta caused severe rebound irritability with either aggression or weepiness. Intuniv (not a stimulant) caused major sleepiness regardless of when he took it (would fall asleep in the car on the way home & I could sometimes get dinner in him but a bath was out of the question) & daytime enuresis (wetting himself).,M,7,7  months10 mg 1X D,6/30/2012Email,Focalin xr
5, 4, ADHD,None known,My 7 year old son just switched to the XR 20 mg capsule and takes it once in the morning.  He was taking the 5 mg tablet twice a day but had to change due to summer camp not willing to give him meds there.  There have been no side effects with the new dosage and he does great through out the day!,M,7.5,2  weeks20MG 1X D,7/3/2011Email,Focalin xr
6, 4, ADHD,loss of appetite_ trouble sleeping,This is the third drug my son has tried for his AD/HD.  So far it seems to be working and he has little side effects.  I will re-evaluate in a month or so.  It took a month to side effects when he was on Daytrana and those side effects were pretty bad.,M,4,4  days10 mg 1X D,5/6/2011Email,Focalin xr
7, 5, AD/HD,My son had quite a lot of appetite loss_ difficulty gaining weight_ some trouble getting to sleep but we were able to counter that with Melatonin quite easily.,We've tried my son on Concerta_ Adderall_ Vyvanse_ Focalin Immediate Release and Strattera. Out of all the meds the Focalin XR seems to have the fewest side effects for him. The others either do nothing at all or make him moody and aggressive.,M,6,1  years10mg 1X D,3/1/2011Email,Focalin xr
8, 4, Adult ADD,dry mouth_ mid-day crash_ decreased appetite,I've been on Focalin XR 10mg for a week now.  My doc added it after trying straterra for 10 weeks with minimal improvement. I'll titrate to 20mg after 14 days.  So far so good_ my focus and attention has improved_ I'm able to stick with a task until completion.  I hate the mid-day crash_ its weird I'll crash then I'll get a second wind.  Its like its releases in spurts instead of gradually throughout the day.,F,30,7  days10 1X D,6/18/2010,Focalin xr
