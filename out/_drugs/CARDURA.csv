1, 3, BPH and high blood pressure,No problem for about 15 years.  Then an additional medication (Sinemet) was added for Parkinson's symptoms.  I immediately experienced severe nasal congestion and huge amounts of mucus discharge.  These symptoms were so severe they kept me awake most the night.  Symptoms included coughing_ gagging on mucus_ spitting_ clearing my throat_ and blowing my nose.  Sleep problems were prominent for almost a year until I figured out the problem.,I eventually learned that the Sinemet enhanced the action of Cardura_ including the associated side effects.  My GP was convinced it was an allergy.  My neurologist insisted it could not be Sinemet.  Neither considered the possibility of an interaction.,M,72,15  years2 mg 1X D,5/9/2014Email,Cardura
2, 5, BPH,Initially I experienced occasional dizzy spells until my system stabilized to it. Possibly contributes to dry eyes_ but age and other meds are more likely culprits.,Started on 2mg and doubled dose each year until now at current 8mg which works well to control urination urges and increase flow,M,58,12  years8mg 1X D,3/6/2011,Cardura

4, 4, BPH,Feeling weak & tired.  Disturbed sleep at nite.  Somewhat depressed.  Dizzy when getting up.,Less side effects with lower dose.  Better than Flomax on side effects.  Maybe_ I should go back down to 2 mg a day soon.,M,70,1  years4 mg 1X D,3/22/2010,Cardura
5, 3, high blood pressure,much reduced sensation on ejaculation.  one event of a lot of blood in urine.,when on this drug i did not have to get up in the night to urinate.  i stopped taking the drug when i had a lot of blood in the urine - my doctor did not think the drug caused this - it could have been too much exertion during exercise.  however I have had no recurrence since stopping the drug.,M,58,1  months,1/23/2010,Cardura

9, 2, for symptoms of BPH,Side effects include shortness of breath_ palpitations_dizziness_ pre-syncope_ fatigue.,I continued taking Cardura for several years for relief of urinary symptoms_ especially problems urinating at night. The side effects were bad to alarming_ but other alpha blockers including Uroxatrol and Flomax were ineffective by comparison to Cardura.  I found that between 1 and 2mg nightly were enough to improve urination while keeping the side effects to a barely tolerable level.I finally decided to go with surgery and had a TURP_ and will thankfully say goodbye to Cardura.,M,70,5  years,11/28/2008Email,Cardura

Taking 10mg Norvasc on its own for 2 years_ but it suddenly stopped working. Added 2 mg Cardura_ but after 3 weeks_ I could not stand the side effects any more_ so quit.BP went up to 180/90 but I felt better than on the Cardura.I had some atenolol and went back to the old system and took 1/4 tablet once a day. Feel great and bp is now 148/70.I hate Cardura with a passion.I guess I'll be in trouble from my doctor  - too bad!,M,61,3  days,4/1/2008,Cardura
12, 2, High blood pressure,Short of breath_ weak_ swelling in joints (6mg)_ retaining water_ irregular heart beat_,Started on 4 mg evenings_ then had a breakthrough after first 2 months (BP when back up)_ started on 6mg at bedtime and the bad side effects started.

14, 1, High Blood Pressure,out of breath walking_ pounding heart_ severe migraine_ numb legs and arms at night_ palpitations and terrible 'fitting' type tremours.  The last straw was when I kept on passing out every so often_ so ended up in hospital for 5 days.  It had affected my nervous system (fight or flight).  I know not everyone has same outcome but I wouldn't reccommend this drug_ there are better ones with less side effects e.g. lisinopril,,F,34,28  days,2/6/2008,Cardura
15, 5, Uremic poisoning aftermath.,Fantastically vivid dreams. Wonderful detailed dreams in technicolor.,The first night I took it I had insomnia--couldn't go to sleep for 7 hours. But my brain raced all night and went through my entire 2 year residence in Germany. I laughed so hard at things that did not seem funny at the time I was really living them that I had to stuff the sheet in my mouth to not laugh out loud. Very strange experience. The second third and fourth nights I had such detailed fantastic dreams that I was looking forward to the fifth night. My husband_ a GP took it away from me and would only give me the original dosage (I was supposed to double it on the 5th night) and I didn't have any more dreams. After 7 days he threw it out. Probably thought I was enjoying it too much. I am an artist_ and extremely sensitive to color. Have you questioned any female artists about their experiences on this drug? I loved taking it.,F,61,7  days,1/28/2008,Cardura
