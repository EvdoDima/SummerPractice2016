4, 1, severe knee pain,Foggy_ headachey_ then went into shakes for several hours  all this taking just 1/4 pill! Hated it. I am very drug sensitive so decided i better just try part of a pill..  sure glad I didn't take a whole pill. Unreal.....forget this! Back to Advil..,,F,59,1  days750/7.5 1X D,4/25/2012Email,Vicodin es
5, 5, 3 years,tiredness_headache,very good at relieving my severe arthiritis pain in knees and spine.  I usually take between 1 and 3 per day depending on the weather and what type of physical activity I am involved in.The drug does make you feel calm and peacefull in addition to relief of pain but I do not think I could ever take more than 3 per day due to the fatigue.,F,63,3  years750 3X D,11/20/2011,Vicodin es

7, 4, Chronic Neck pain. ACDF Surgery,Headache_ sleepiness_ constipation_ dizziness.,Works well to reduce the pain.  Can be addictive so I only take it when I really need it.,F,24,6  months7.5/750 2X AN,10/23/2011Email,Vicodin es
8, 4, pain after extraction,constipation_ mild nausea,"Great for real pain_ but not abuse_ in my case. I used to love having extra opiate pills_ for ""fun""_ around after dental mauling_ but now I get too constipated. And I'm sick of all that tylenol. Big deal--no chance for addiction anymore. I only took two doses (needed) and got plugged up for the next day. Ugh.",F,59,1  days7.5-750 4X D,10/11/2011,Vicodin es
9, 3, Chronic Nerve and Pelvic Pain,Constipation_ alert (Can not take at night!)_ happy go lucky_ itchy nose_ short term memory loss,7.5/750 Doesn't take away the pain_ merely distracts me from it about 75% of the time. I have chronic pelvic pain_ nerve pain with my glute muscles fusing together and hitting nerves after I had my coccyx removed 4 years ago. I take a half of a pill_ maybe a whole pill almost everyday. Constant pain_ spikes about 6+ times a day_ sometimes bringing me to tears. Scared of addiction and try to just deal with the pain.,F,24,10  months,10/9/2009Email,Vicodin es
10, 5, surgery pain/recreational,Biggest side effect: tolerance_ addiction_ and withdrawal. Vicodin was my only relief after I had my tonsils and adenoids taken out at the age of 24_ but like a lot of people_ I liked it too much. This began an opiate addiction that lasted for almost 9 months. I'm finally off them_ but I wouldn't say that people shouldn't take Vicodin because you can get addicted. Just make sure you are making good choices and have a doctor that it monitoring you properly. It doesn't matter how amazing Vicodin makes you feel_ it's not worth the 30 minutes of euphoria to completely ruin your life like I did. Side effects: nausea_ vomiting_ itching_ drowsiness at first_ noticeable euphoria_ more sociable_ more energy_ coming down is very unpleasant_ and withdrawal is one of the worst things I have ever experienced (nausea_ vomiting_ diarrhea_ severe dysphoria_ shakes_ extreme anxiety).,Wonderful drug for moderate to severe pain_ but be careful with it.,F,24,9  months,9/3/2009,Vicodin es
11, 2, Fibromyalgia Muscle Pain,Headaches_ stomach pain_ and joint stiffness/gave me a strong arthritis type pain all over. Pain was almost like a bad flu,Didn't help much with fibro pain plus I don't like that taking the prescribed dosage of 2 tabs every 4-6 hrs puts you almost at a tylenol overdose.  I switched meds after a 37 yr old friend of mine had to have a liver transplant and almost died.  She never abused dosage and if you ask me it isn't worth risk.  There are better meds out there.,F,35,1  years,8/29/2009,Vicodin es
12, 3, Chronic pain from MVA,anger issues_ anxiety_ after extended use ineffective for pain level.  constipation_ loss of libido.  General dryness.  Weight loss.  Intollerance (violent sickness) if alcohol ingested_ even small quantities (1 glass of wine).,Worked great for a year or so but after taking it for so long it no longer worked to eliviate pain.  I took varying levels of opiates for 9 years straight.  Withdrawal is horrible.  I tapered dosage in half for a month_ then in half again for another month_ until one day I quit taking them altogether.  I will NEVER use pain pills for my pain again unless post-op.  The withdrawal is not worth it.,F,45,9  years,4/24/2009,Vicodin es
13, 4, car accident hurt shoulder,sleppiness,I love this drug to get high pretty good for pain_ BUT I wouldnt take it too long,F,31,90  days,3/5/2009,Vicodin es
14, 4, Severe joint damage,Impaired vision_ slight dizziness_ and extreme energy and hyperactivity .,Even though this medication can help I would not recommend it unless you truly truly need it. The medication can become addictive and cause abdominal problems and liver problems.,M,28,2  years,2/20/2009Email,Vicodin es
15, 4, fibromyalgia,sleepiness_ itchiness,I take it periodically when my pain gets to the point where I can't sleep. I am terrified of becoming addicted and needing greater doses_ so I use it only when my pain is unbearable.  It puts me to sleep and I wake up the next morning feeling significantly better_ even when I'm in a downward spiral.,F,55,3  years,2/13/2009,Vicodin es
16, 5, Recreational,Euphoric_ sociable_ pain-free.,I think I liked it a little too much.  When mixed with alcohol_ it causes extreme euphoria.  I found I was much more talkative and relaxed around others...to the point where when I didn't have it_ I could barely function.  Still dealing with addiction to it_ day by day.,F,22,1  years,12/19/2008Email,Vicodin es
17, 5, degenerative disc disease,"a little nauseous when started taking. constipation. the word constipation does not do it justice. there is a definate ""hydro"" turd. nothing like you've ever experianced. any over the counter stool softner/laxative helps a lot.",vicodin has made every day life a little easier. I have degenerative disc disease (lumbar). 2 disc bulge directly on my spinal cord. both discs are completely blacked out on mri and another is gray.have been to several neurologist and at this point because of the position of the discs I have no other options. you must be careful with this med because of the possible  addiction. the feeling you get out of it is wonderful BUT only take to alleviate the pain. I dont need to be completely pain free just relieved enough to work. for me this philosophy has kept me from addiction. I can go without it with no withdrawls just a lot of pain. one thing that has helped me decrease my dose_ 4 7.5 a day to 2-2 and a half_ is an inversion table. this helps take pressure off my spine. be very careful with this med!,M,38,1  years,11/7/2008,Vicodin es
18, 1, Oral surgery,I felt like I was knocked over the head_ and held down_ and I became very nauseated. I was trapped on the verge of hurling_ but fighting it since doing so would make things very messy in my mouth where I had lots of stitches and couldn't well clean. A bad night.,"Reading the other comments_ I see I am in a minority. So_ this med may work just fine for you. Maybe it's better on a ""full"" stomach -- something not easy to achieve when one's had surgery in one's mouth.",F,50,1  times,5/31/2008,Vicodin es
19, 5, Knee Surgery and Low Back Pain,Little Dry Mouth and some Constipation_ Thats it.,The Best Pain Killer so far. Makes you fell good inside. I take 1 in the morning with my Coffee_ 1 during the mid day while working_ and 2 at night before before bed with Green Tea and I'm fine. Dont eat heavy food with it eat light and a good hot bowl of soup works the best. I have taken Vicodin for 6 years I take 3-4 a day and i have (NO PAIN AT ALL)... Just dont over medicate yourself. It works take it!!!!,M,35,6  years,11/16/2007,Vicodin es
20, 3, 4 Wisdom Teeth Extracted,Very drowsey while sitting/laying down however_if I was moving i'd be fine. Itching. Occasional disorientation and dizziness.,I would take 2 vicodin every 4 to 5 hours and one to two ibuprofen inbetween taking them. There was still a considerable amount of pain if I was doing anything with my mouth (eating_ drinking_ talking) but it helped more then just taking the ibuprofen alone.,F,19,3  days,9/26/2007Email,Vicodin es
21, 4, Neck pain due to bone growth,Slightly sleepy. Slightly lower concentration level. No constipation.,Works well for my chronic pain. I am prescribed 4 per day_ but sometimes only take 3. Prior to taking Vicodin I was miserable_ now I almost feel normal. I am happy with the results and the side effects are mild. I will be taking it long term and hope that I do not become tolerant. Vicodin does not make me feel euphoric. I feel no other need to take other than for pain control.,M,50,1.5  months,9/15/2007,Vicodin es
22, 5, Post Multiple Tooth Extraction,NONE.  No side effects & No Pain!,I would strongly recommend this medication!,M,54,8  weeks,3/3/2007Email,Vicodin es
23, 4, 4 Wisdom teeth extracted,Sleepiness_ some dizziness_  itching all over.,This medication helped take the pain away quickly_ within minutes after taking it.  It also makes me sleepy within minutes after taking it_ I could hardly keep my eyes open.   But after some sleeping I wake up refreshed and are able to get stuff done. The pain was so unbearable right after surgery_ that I had to take two on my first dose_ which made me real dizzy....didn't do that again.  On the second day of taking the medication I got so itchy all over.  I got the same itching side effect from taking morphine a few years ago after a surgery.  Much better then Percocet...I hate percocet  ...it makes me so unbearably nauseous .,F,,6  days,1/21/2007,Vicodin es
24, 3, back surgeries,constipation_ euphoria_ withdrawl symptoms of low grade fever_ depression_ nervous twitches_ rashes_ weight gain,"over time dosage must increase to provide relief.  when I run out I feel like a junkie_ trying to buy from internet.  currently in withdrawl.  I hate this medication but I love the relief it provides.  I really want to get into physical therapy again and stop taking vicodin_ or at least reduce the number of times I take it per day.  I have taken anywhere from 5 to 20 per day recently.  I feel like I'm falling into the ""cycle"" described by others on this page and am trying to stop it without rehab.  I've never had addiction issues with anything before.  I've had lamanectomy and spinal fusions and pain is bad but this medication is just as bad and very dangerous.",M,51,2  years,12/1/2006Email,Vicodin es
25, 4, For pain,A little light headedness_sleepiness.And stomach irritation if taken without food.,I TRY TO TAKE THE SMALEST DOSE AND I STILL GET SOME RELIEF.IF I TAKE A WHOLE TABLET IT MAKES ME TALK ALOT.,F,33,6  months,10/20/2006,Vicodin es
26, 5, hand surgery,Mild euphoria (nice trip!); occasional rebound headache; occasional mild nausea_ the result of taking Vicodin on an empty stomach; mild disruption in sleep.,Also prescribed Phenergan in combo with Vicodin to fend of nausea.  Only trouble is that Phenergan puts you sleep in zombie land for a long time.  Great for pain relief -- and the side effects (except for nausea) are pleasant.  One feels a sense of calm after taking Vicodin.,M,40,1  months,7/10/2006,Vicodin es
27, 5, Herniated discs & arthritis in neck,Mental fuzziness_ lack of focus and fatigue.,The side effects are worth the pain relief. Without it_ I would not be able to work or play. I only take 2.5-3 p/day (7.5/750)--NEVER anymore than that. I most likely have a physical dependence since I've taken the same dose for about two years. But I know I'm not psychologically addicted (if I was_ I'd be wanting to take more); however_ most doctors have a problem prescribing it long term--even though it's obvious I'm not abusing the drug. My last doctor agreed to prescribe it long term. Question is: Why only her and not the others?  Any comments from other chronic pain sufferers who use this drug?  P.S. I used to take it with Oxycontin but I didn't like the idea of taking that drug so I detoxed myself off of it. I'm glad I did.,F,52,2  years,5/4/2006Email,Vicodin es
28, 1, to get high,constipation_ very dizzy_ cannot function,Very easily addicting.. I had some left over from a root canal and decided to take it. In the beginning_ it was fun.. After 2 weeks_ I tried to stop and my skin was itching like crazy and i felt depressed to the point where I couldnt function. I got more illegally and then after a week I came to my senses and stopped. The withdraw is bad... again_ itchy skin_ dizzy.... bearable though. I am glad I stopped.. Please be careful with this.,F,24,3  weeks,4/2/2006,Vicodin es

After prolonged use the drug is now only effective for approx. 3 hours.
