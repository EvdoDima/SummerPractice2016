0, 2, TMJD_severe back/neck spasms,I've taken this on several occasions_ and each time have noticed that the mental side effects are atrocious. That said_ this drug does relieve the pain associated with severe  muscular tension.  Unfortunately_ as soon as the medication wears off_ I find myself somewhere between rage and profound depression. I'm groggy_ weepy_ needy_ and feel entirely out of control for upwards of 2-3 days afterward. For me_ these effects outweigh the benefits of this drug.,The medication works; however_ it should be dispersed with a label stating that you might what to jump out of a window when you finally wake up from the mini-coma it induces.,F,27,1  weeks10mg 1X D,9/14/2013Email,Cyclobenzaprine hcl

2, 4, Fibromyalgia,Fatigue_ dizziness,Normally this medicine isn't used on a long term basis but my doctor made an exception because it helps fight the fibromyalgia muscle spasms so that I can get a good night's sleep. Because I've been on it so long_ I no longer feel tired from it during the day. It has not lost its effectiveness nor have I needed a dosage increase.
