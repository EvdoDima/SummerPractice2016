BP 115/70 approx when ever I check it. 71 in aug/09 and been on this stuff for over 10 yrs. If I have any side effects they are to minor to notice unlike some other poisons I have been prescribed (CRESTOR). Been around a long time unlike the new not fully tested combination wonder drugs your Dr. can hardly wait for you to try. Your reading this so you know whats going on but have you talked to your friends about the drugs they are taking who may not have internet. I do it all the time now and I find the elderly expect to be in some kind of pain just because of their age and seldom blame the drugs. I have had serious problems because of prescription drugs and had to find out by myself what it was and thank God I did. Dont be shy Talk to your friends about your aches and pains as well as theirs. Good health to you all.,,M,70,12  years,5/25/2009,Ziac
