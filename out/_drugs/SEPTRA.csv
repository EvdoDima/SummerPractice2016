1, 1, Severe Diarrhea,Anxiety_ insomnia and heart palpitations,I took this drug for 1 day_ once in the am and once in the pm_ and by that night I started feeling anxious so I decided to stop taking this med. Today is starting my third day off of this stuff and the anxiety has gotten worse or its just me stressing out or not sleeping at all last night. I am really starting to wonder how long this stuff is going to stick with me. If there is anyone out there who has overcome these side effects please share your story on this site as I have read through several hundreds of reviews and have not seen any clear answers as to anyone recovering. I just feel like I'm in a pit right now and I just want some good news. Please someone just email me so I'm not alone through this.,M,27,1  days800/160 2X D,2/11/2016Email,Septra
2, 4, UTI,Gas_ anxiety_ occasional stomach ache_ headache_ body aches,I went through Septra much better than any other antibiotic_ it had its side effects though.

3, 2, UTI,No appetite at all. Heart racing. Hot and cold chills. Bad taste in mouth. Gas. Memory loss. Confusion. insomina.,The doctor prescribed me this for 10 days twice a day. After very 1st dose_ my appetite completely was gone. My heart feels like it is beating out of my chest. I have a nasty taste in my mouth. I cannot remember anything. I can't sleep neither. I feel so sick it's not even funny. I made it two full days. I really thought I could make it threw the week but I just cant. I just want to feel like myself again. The side effects are unbearable for me. So Ill just have to call the docs and get a alternative medicine because Im done never ever again!,F,25,10  days,11/18/2015,Septra

I'm shocked to see that the Doctors are not aware of the horrible side effects.,F,17,6  days 2X D,3/17/2015,Septra

Made me super sluggish as well but the pain was so intense I had to quit taking it.,After my 2nd dose on day 3 I called the Doc and told her I wouldn't take anymore of this med.  Guess what?

10, 1, UTI,Took Septra a few years ago and didn't like the nausea. Got another UTI and took one dose.  Vomiting_ chills_ muscle aches_ sore throat that felt like I had popcorn stuck in it.  Then next morning both the backs of hands were numb_ and red eyes. Generally felt like I was beat with a bat.  Crazy.  Wanted to go to hospital but figured I should wait till it was at least 24 from the first dose.  Made me feel better to read all these other side effects.  Thanks,,F,42,1  days,10/5/2014,Septra
11, 1, uti,Sharp pains shooting in legs_ nausea_ vomiting_ absolutely awful feeling. Did not react to this antibiotic well AT ALL. Do not recommend this to anyone.

15, 1, inflammed follicle/cyst,Vomiting_ constipation_ diarrhea_ extreme nausea_ headache_ hallucinations_ confusion_ short term memory loss.,I have not been able to even smell food without getting sick. I stopped taking it this afternoon 8/19 after reading the posts on this site. All this afternoon and evening I have still been nauseous and have a headache. I've been only drinking ginger tea. I found a different option; burdock root which I plan to start in 48 hours when hopefully the Septra (death pill) will be out of my system. I feel like my Dr. tried to kill me. He and I are having a long talk at my appointment next week. I have never thrown up so much in my life. I'm really sorry to hear about everyone else's side effects_ especially the guy who woke up in the hospital. I don't know who approves these drugs but THEY really should do more in depth testing. My fault for trusting my Doctor or is it my Doctor's fault for trusting whoever the heck approved this pill from Hell. From now on I will do my own damn research on any and every pill prescribed to me before I take it. Even Motrin. Good luck and I hope anyone reading this stops the pill and finds another solution. I'm going to go throw up again. Fingers crossed that this will be the last time.,F,30,4  days160/800 2X D,8/19/2013,Septra

19, 1, Ear Infection,My daughter was prescribed septra and within and hour of taking the drug her nose started to bleed profusely and took over a hour to clot.The amount of blood coming out was so much that she also began throwing up blood from it going down her throat. This happened two more times that day. Found out after researching it that in rare cases it can cause problems with decreasing blood platelets leading to clotting problems. First sign is severe nose bleeds and bleeding.gums. After 24 hrs of not being on this the symptoms disappeared. Beware on this drug and if something is happening out of the ordinary once you're on it the cause is probably the medicine,,F,6,1  days,4/7/2013,Septra

25, 1, ear infection,Started having flu like symptoms after a day or so which I failed to recognize as side effects of this drug because neither the doctor or pharmacist mentioned any possble effects other than rashes_nausea or yeast infection.Symptoms kept worsening daily (just like the flu):persistant headache_body ache_back ache_stiff neck_muscle weakness_nausea_loss of appetite_low grade fever that was rising_heart palpitations_shortness of breath_skin sensitive to the touch_swollen lymph nodes_sore throat. I felt as if I had been poisoned-I am not exagerrating.I was debating on going to the ER when it dawned on me to research this drug (there was no printout included from the pharmacy so I had to look it up on the internet).I was shocked at what I read.MANY people had experienced similar effects and some were even worse. I stopped the drug immediately and within a day my health began slowly improving.And to top it off it didn't even clear up my infection!This is a dangerous drug and after researching even more about it I am convinced that it should NOT be prescribed by any doctor -even as a last resort- because the risks DO NOT outweigh the very few benefits_ if any_ there might be and besides_there are many alternative antibiotics that could be prescribed instead.This drug is a dangerous  and destructive drug.

The first four days were fine_ and the drug beat the infection quickly_ but on the fifth day I had very serious chest pain and felt like I was breathing through a straw.  I never wanted to take it again in my life!  My doctors(s) told me that next time I would just need the dosage reduced due to my kidney dysfunction_ so that my kidneys could process the drug and it didn't build up in my system again.  So_ now it's next time_ another kidney infection_ I'm taking 1/2 dosage for one or two days and then 1/3 dosage for 3x the number of days.  The first day or two were fine_ but I'm starting to get the jitters and the chest discomfort again (very mildly right now).  To be honest_ I'm now scared of this drug.  I rated it a 3_ because it does really knock out an infection and works for those who don't,F,44, ,11/25/2008,Septra
