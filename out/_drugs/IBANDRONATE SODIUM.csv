0, 1, prevent osteoporosis,I have been taking Boniva for 2 years with no adverse side effects. I took my first dose of this generic Boniva 4 days ago and had horrible side effects including numbness and tingling on one side of my face_ it felt like something popped in my jaw (spasm)_ numbness around my midsection_ and insomnia. My doctor said these were all side effects. The insurance company decided to change my prescription to generic without my doctor's consent. My doctor took me off of this and the Boniva permanently. I would not recommend either drug to anyone. They should be taken off the market.,,F,91,1  days150 mg,10/3/2013Email,Ibandronate sodium
