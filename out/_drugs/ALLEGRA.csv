0, 1, allergy shots,dizzyness_ irritabilty_ blurred vision_ feeling amped up,would rather be sleepy on Benadryl.   Currently on allergy shot regimen_ and they want me to take anti histamines to prevent reaction.   Allegra is the only med I take and it makes me feel awful.   Mean_ dizzy_ cant focus my eyes.

1, 1, Seasonal allergies,"Have been taking Allegra on and off for over a year. Been taking it regularly now for over a month due to high allergy season. Have been suffering from dizziness_ vertigo_ ear pain_ tinnitus_ fullness in ears_ mood swings to point where my husband and children have stayed clear of me_ lack of energy_ recent muscle spasms in legs and feet like ""Charlie horses"" that awaken me in the night_ depression for no reason_ feeling ""out of it"" unable to concentrate_ blurred vision_ dry eyes_ neck pain_ lower back pain_ stomach pain_ feeling discontent. I do not suffer from depression. Have suffered from insomnia and was taking trazodone for that. Stopped taking it thinking THAT was the cause of my symptoms. Felt better the next day. No dizziness or vertigo for 3 days. Turns out I had stopped taking trazodone AND allegra at the same time be said I thought I was getting too dried out and that was causing inner ear problem. Started to sneeze and itch so took Allegra. Then next day my dizziness_ nausea_ fullness in ears_ tinnitus_ etc returned. Now after reading these posts I believe it was the ALLEGRA that was causing my issues all along. I just took my last dose today. And I'm not going to let my teenage daughters take it again either as they've experienced similar but less frequent side effects too!",,F,46,1  years30 mg 1x D,6/21/2016,Allegra

4, 1, Dermograpism,I suffer from Dermograpism and it had recently flared up. I went to cvs and asked a pharmacist his recommendation because I had already been on prednisone. He recommended Allegra and it worked wonderfully for the itchiness and welts that I would get. However_ I would never use this again due to its side effects. I've had trouble sleeping_ sore throat_ stomach problems_ joint and muscle pain especially in my shoulders and arms and am very weak. I would rather endure the flare ups of my Dermograpism than to feel completely helpless and in constant pain and discomfort. Never again.,I am hoping this is out of my system soon.

8, 1, Allergies,Psychiatric disturbances_ back pain_ dry eyes_ peeling lips_ tooth pain_ fatigue_ constipation,Wow. Where to start. I've been taking Allegra on and off for a few years_ but I recently started taking it almost every day due to sinus issues. It seems that the side effects have been building up over time. I have an autoimmune disease that causes joint pain_ but I started experiencing an abnormal presentation of back pain after a few weeks of daily dosing. I was considering going back on immunosuppressants to resolve this pain. I also started experiencing heightened anxiety_ feeling like I was going to have a meltdown at work. Eventually I started feeling lethargic/depressed/empty and was ready to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist. I also started noticing peeling_ dry lips_ loss of appetite_ and constipation. I didn't realize that it could be the Allegra causing these issues_ as I have a few chronic health problems that can present with similar symptoms_ but I have been feeling more like my old self after cessation of my Allegra regimene. I don't even think that my allergies are that much worse without Allegra.,M,28,6  months180mg,4/1/2016,Allegra

10, 1, Dust allergy and full ears,My legs feel weak_ heavy and jumpy.  I feel dizzy and unsteady even when just standing. I feel out of it like I can't think straight and there is a feeling of doom which leads to anxiety and a fear that something is terribly wrong.  The insomnia is terrible. I can fall asleep because of being extremely tired late at night but wake up a couple hours later with the feeling of doom and anxiety and then I am unable to fall back asleep.  The med seems to work when I first take it for my full ears but then about six hours in it starts to wear off and then the side effects start.  Awful feeling!,After trying this a few times and getting the same results each time I'm concluding its the med.  I'm throwing it out!  Never again!

11, 1, sinus infection,To my friends and family that I recommended ALLEGRA to_ I'm very sorry. 2015_ I took ALLEGRA D 24 and I ended up at urgent care. I could not urinate. 10mins in a stall and all I could manage was a trickle. I thought I had kidney stones. Got a really bad sinus infection_ 2016. Thought I would give it a try again. This time I took ALLEGRA D 12hr_ drank 3 bottles of water and same side effect. In a stall with tear coming out one eye. I was a Marine but it hurts that bad. I drank a total of 10 bottle waters_ a large glass at dinner and glass by my bed. I'm having fever aches_my mouth is very dry_ the roof of my mouth burns_ I'm so restless that I can't sleep and it still takes 5mins to pee. I'm done with ALLEGRA. NEVER AGAIN.

I lost my taste for several hours on the 10th day taking Allegra_ and took one more pill on day 11_ then I completely lost my smell and taste. I quit Allegra for good on day 12_ and now it is day 13 my smell and taste still not coming back. Someone said here her taste was gone for one and half year! I hope it does not take me that long! This was the third winter since I had severe allergy and it was the first time I tried to take allergy pills on a regular basis. I did not take any allergy medicine the past two winters and I survived. Allegra made my congestion worse.

They said to take Azelastine_ but after reading the reviews they are too similar to this med so I will not take anything but natural for now.",Never again!

I wish I would've came here first before taking it and I was really freaked out. Also it says something about this product that I was feeling these symptoms only after 2 days of taking this.

18, 1, seasonal allergies,My twin grandsons took this with doctors instructions due to runny noses and coughs due to allergies.  After four days one of the twins mood changed he seemed sad and started acting out in daycare very angry and hitting also acted out during water play almost afraid of water which was not usual behavior.  He started hitting other children and the only thing that had changed was putting him on medicine.  His twin started to show signs of being defiant.  I immediately stopped giving them tbe medicine which tookaanother week to get them back to their normal selves. Very scary and sad that they couldn't express themselves and state how they were feeling.  I can't imagine what the outcome would have been if I didn't put two and two together the long term effect it wouldhhave done.  Afterwards I read these reviews my suspicions were confirmed.  Parents should be aware very difficult to watch a child go thru this.  I immediately threw out medicine.  I would rather deal with runny nose and cough than aggressive behavior and child of 3 say im scared.,Do not give to young child whi cannot express his feelings thru out.,,3,7  days,10/27/2015Email,Allegra

20, 2, Seasonal allergies,Chest pain_ pressure & tightness. Difficulty breathing. Changes in EKG,Allegra was very effective initially_ but efficacy lessened the longer I took it. Then ~ not knowing it was bad until after the fact ~ I was taking it while using acidic supplements I.e. vitamin C & Cranberry caps (for an unrelated health issue)  & I believe this is what spawned the cardiac problems {I read later it's not supposed to be taken with fruit juice.} The chest pain felt like classic heart attack symptoms & I went right to the Dr. My EKG is slightly different but the changes are not significant_ thank goodness. And once I stopped the Allegra & got a lot of rest_ the chest pain & dyspnea went away. *I also read later that fexofenadine / Allegra is a 2nd generation metabolite drug of terfenadine / Seldane that was taken off the market in 1998 for cardiac arrhythmias that caused sudden death.  An FYI & thanks to everyone who contributes to this site! A go-to for me from now on when I need to use a new med.,F,42,6  weeks 1X D,9/25/2015,Allegra
21, 1, Seasonal allergies,Weak legs_ horrible back pain_ dizziness_ stomach pain,Over 2 years ago I started having back pain to the point that I was bed ridden for almost a year. The Drs couldn't figure it out. I went through PT several times and different pain meds_ but nothing helped. A family member asked me if I was taking Allegra_ I was_ she told me to get off of it. I did and the pain got better. At least I could function again. Not too long ago_ I tried the 60 mg thinking it wouldn't be as strong. Within a few days_ my back was killing me and my legs were weak. I have thrown it all out. I will never take Allegra again. Nasty stuff!,F,48,1  months60 or 180,9/20/2015,Allegra
22, 1, seasonal allergies,I have seen multiple doctors_ done multiple tests_ and spent thousands of dollars trying to figure out what was wrong with my body. I thought is was MS_ or muscular dystrophy. I would get severe weakness in my legs_ and some trembling.  I had no physical strength in my body what so ever. It was very frustrating. And the doctors couldn't figure it out. Well_ I just figured it out. It s the Allergra. After 3 months of having no symptoms_ and then all of a sudden the symptoms have come back_ it has dawned on me that it is the Allegra that I just started taking again for my seasonal allergies that is causing it. This drug is not for everyone.  My son has no physical side effects like me_ but he gets very emotional on this medicine. And he is not a sensitive emotional kind of kid. I actually like that it brings out his emotional side. Benyadryl made him extremely angry and abusive. So I'll take sensitive and emotional over that.,,F,32,4  weeks30mg 1X D,9/17/2015,Allegra
23, 1, Allergies,At first drug seemed amazing stopped side effects of allergies about half an hour after taking it. However within a few days I started to feel different I itched_ and felt sad and stressed. I put this down to being 'hormonal' like every girl my age does. However I started to feel dread towards something unknown almost like depression that I had no way of explaining. My mum noticed a difference in me but again put it down to hormones. I then on my 21st day of taking it had horrible hand tremors that lasted around 12 hours to then wake up and have the most excruciating arm muscle pain when bending the elbow_ (This is today as I am writing) I started thinking the most horrible things were happening to me such as MS or some other devastating muscular disease. I know it sounds dramatic but is honestly started to diagnose myself. I am normally outgoing and always on the move however today is my third day of not leaving the house because I am so tired and weak legged. I decided to google the drug after I have been sitting here crying for twenty minutes for no apparent reason. And I found this site where 685 other people have had similar reactions. Feww_ I don't wish it upon anyone at all_ but I'm glad that I'm not alone in being an absolute mess when taking this.

28, 1, seasonal allergies,Dizziness_ stomach cramps_ extreme tiredness_ tingling and numbness in leg_ face_ and arm_ inability to concentrate_ headache_ paranoia,I used to take allegra on occasion for my allergies_ then at the start of summer I began taking it once daily. A few days after I started it gave me weird numbness and tingling all down my right leg_ but I didn't make the connection that it was the allegra. Then gradually over the last two months my symptoms have gotten more severe_ I became super anxious and paranoid and thought that I was seriously ill or diabetic_ and consequently was unable to fall sleep. Just a couple days ago I realized it must be the allegra because there were a brief few days I had forgotten to take it_ and I felt a lot better and didn't have the tingling in my face that had been happening a few times every day. I was still taking it after that time because once again I didn't make the connection to the allegra_ but now I have. It has been two days since I stopped taking it_ and while my symptoms haven't gone away entirely yet_ I do feel somewhat better.,F,26,2  months180 mg 1X D,7/25/2015,Allegra
29, 5, Chronic Uticaria,None! Great pill to take!,I used to take Minocyclin in an effort to rid of my severe body acne. That didn't work and left me with nonstop hives less than a month after taking it. Even when I stopped taking Minocyclin my hives were uncontrollable. I never had hives before that pill. The hives were so bad I would have to go to the ER and urgent cares. They would wake me up in the middle of the night_ would appear everywhere on my body and face_ and make me feel like ants were crawling under my skin. Absolutely terrible.Because my condition was so severe_ several doctors put me on steroids_ which none worked. I went to an allergist_ and she told me I was allergic to several insects_ foods_ and plants_ but through a blood test taken in 2015 I found out that was false. Anyways_ after the steroid dosages I was prescribed Allegra. That's how long I've been taking it_ back in the day when it wasn't available over-the-counter. Personally_ I felt that Allegra when it was prescribed was stronger. However_ the over-the-counter 180mg dosage is great too. I take it only when I break out in hives_ which isn't every day but maybe 2-3 times a week.I regret taking that darn acne pill_ but life happens. Allegra has helped me get through many things with no side effects. I wish you all the best with this pill_ don't be discouraged to try it!,F,20,6  years189,7/24/2015Email,Allegra

My head feels a little funny like when your nose is stopped up but not as terrible. The sensation makes me feel a little loopy. I hope the nose thing goes away as I go back to smaller doses.,Like many commenters I've been irritable and crying but I really think it's because I'm covered in ugly burning itching hives and there's a fairly good chance they'll never figure out why and I could be like this for 20 or more years.

He said this feeling would not go away and he had no reason to feel sad(he is a great student_ has many friends and is very social  and has a pleasant personality). We took him back to his pediatrician and she stopped his Allegra immediately. It has now been two weeks since and he is fine now.

45, 1, yes,This is a horrible medication.  I have been taking Walmart brand fexofenadine for sinus issues.  I worked initially to dry up my sinuses and post nasal drip.  However_ after about 2 weeks I started having heart palpitations_ tremors_ panic attacks_ pain in lower back_ trembling in left leg.  I went to the ER twice.  Was given a clean bill of health (and of course a High medical bill will be coming in the mail.).  I started thinking the most horrible things were happening to me such as ALS_ MS or some other devastating muscular_ or cardiac degenerative disease.  I started eliminating all vitamins_ asthma medication except for Fexofenadine.  I kept on taking that and the symptoms persist.  I finally figured out what was happening to me.

49, 1, Sinus/Allergy,Depression_ itching_ unable to sleep.,Horrible OTC medication. Imagine_ I only took it once a day for two days! I should have listened to the doctor on call at the hospital when he told me over the telephone that I could stay taking Zyrtec instead of switching. There are more reviews against Allegra than for this damn poison. Those of us with the same side effects cannot be wrong.,F,35,2  days,4/9/2015,Allegra
50, 1, Allergies,Severly depressed_ Hand shakes_ Blood pressure_ Extreemly irritable_ unclear thinking.,I really feel that depression should be required on the list of side affects on the bottle.   This was not just the kind of depression like blah day_ but the kind that makes you want to not talk to anyone_ stay in bed_ and hate to say it as it is certainly not the manly thing to say but actually feeling like you want to cry for no reason!,M,38,7  days 1X D,4/2/2015,Allegra
51, 1, Indoor/outdoor allergies,Anxiety. Depression.,"First of all_ let me address those who are criticizing people's experiences and calling them ""hypochondriacs."" And let me offer a well deserved rebuttal for these critical and close-minded individuals who see it fit to parade their uninformed_ unstudied opinions around. People react to medications differently_ individually. This is a thread to educate_ to communicate. Not to tear down. My experience on Allegra is very much like the experiences I have read on server all different websites. During the four weeks that I was on this medication_ I began to experience extreme anxiety and depression for absolutely no reason. I have a fine job. All of my relationships are healthy. It occurred to me to search the web for any sort of correlation between Allegra and anxiety/depression and I found multiple webpages and threads that exposed these sort of symptoms. For those of you claiming that prior experience with depression/anxiety or hypochondria are the real culprits--this is completely untrue. I am a high energy_ charismatic person and have never had any trouble with anxiety or depression. Allegra caused me to feel completely numb_ unable to find any source of joy and crying due to a sense of doom and hopelessness. I didn't want anything to do with my friends. I was completely inconsolable. The side effects of this drug are very real. I've stopped taking it and after two days I'm beginning to feel like myself again. Everyone around me has noticed a difference. We need to b",F,25,4  weeks1 xD,3/27/2015,Allegra
52, 1, Sinuses_ allergies.,Extreme depression_ severe anxiety_ total insomnia. Crazy stuff. Thought I was losing my mind.,When I put two and two together I couldn't believe an over the counter drug could do this to anyone. What I felt like it must be to have a BAD LSD Trip. Never again!,M,55,1  days180,3/27/2015,Allegra
53, 1, Seasonal allergies,Anxiety_ severe depression_ nausea,After 2 doses of this medication_ I experienced extreme anxiety and depression to the point of not being able to stop crying and thinking of how I could end it all. I have never felt so miserable nor have I ever been so scared! After 4 doses_ I realized it was the Allegra and stopped taking it. It's been almost a week and I'm still not completely back to normal but I am feeling so much better. I'll suffer with the sneezing_ itchy and watery eyes and post nasal drip any day over what Allegra did to me!,F,38,4  days30,3/23/2015,Allegra
54, 2, seasonal allergies,Took allegra for three days which led to increased anxiety_heartburn_shaky_increase sinus pressure_ dizzy_felt calmy and generally  on edge all day. I'd rather deal with the allergies then take these meds,,M,29,3  days180mg,3/21/2015,Allegra
55, 3, Indoor winter allegries,Took allegra on and off all winter_ could seem to put one and one together as to why I was so nervous ( much more than normal) so I stopped the coffee.... No caffeine still on and of nerves daily.. Then I had a aniexty attack for no reason following my morning dose .... Then I put it together the aniexty only came when I took the allegra  for 2 or mor days straight ... Racing heart_ a little dizziness.... Not for me,,M,33,5  days60mg,3/16/2015,Allegra
56, 3, seasonal allergies oak tree,Feeling not myself_ sort of depressed_ more tired than usual_ requiring more sleep than normal,Does help somewhat with the allergy symptoms. Experienced the same effects with clatitin and zyrtec which worked the best but makes me the most sleepy and dizzy too! Trying some herbal remedies now that I read all these comments.,F,50,5  days1 every 24,3/6/2015,Allegra
57, 1, Hives,I first took Allegra (180mg) one morning before a fall festival where it was going to be windy_ and it worked great with no side effects. Ten days ago I developed a slowly spreading rash and doc said I could try Allegra. This time I took it at 7 in the evening. At 1am I woke up with upset stomach and bloating and severe dry mouth. I drank water for two hours with some relief. I do have chronic digestive issues and recurrent dry mouth_ so my take is that Allegra 180mg is just too strong for me and not suitable for nighttime use (when laying prone).,,F,44,1  days180MG,3/3/2015,Allegra
58, 2, Asthma and Bad Allergies,Extreme Anxiety_ Hyperactivity_ Nervousness_ Fatigue but wired.  Personality changes_ mood swings.,This is the first time I tried the real brand name Allegra_ before I had only tried the generic.  This drug is horrible.  It did work on my allergy symptoms pretty well_ but the severe anxiety and other side effects are not worth it.  If I dare to take more than 30mg a day_ it's like someone gave me ten lines of cocaine and I'm wired and jacked up like crazy.  Extreme Anxiety and Hyperactivity.  And all kinds of manic and not feeling myself.  And very fatigued_ but wired up.  I'm not the only one who has gotten all this off Allegra_ if you search google_ you will find many people going back over ten years who got all this from Allegra.  It's a terrible drug that never should have been approved.  It shouldn't be given to children_ and it should only be used in very small amounts in the most extreme allergy attack situations and even then_ it's not worth it.,F,45,1  days30mg 2X D,2/11/2015Email,Allegra
59, 2, seasonal allergies,Tried taking allegra twice. First time I took it when first prescribed felt no immediate side effects until day two. Increased anxiety_dizziness_headache and stomach pain. Stopped taking it and a week later figured I'd gave it another shot. Again increased my anxiety_ dizziness_  woke up with a headache and generally felt on edge all day. Also felt an increse in nasal pressure and Congestion.,,M,29,1  days180,1/31/2015,Allegra
