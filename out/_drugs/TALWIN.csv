0, 1, Pain from diverticulitis,I see from comments some had good reactions some had bad as I did. I am similar to few. No vomiting but severe dizziness the next morning. I take a few different other medications (prescribed and not abused) on a regular basis. I took this because of the opiate blocker due to being a 7 year recovering alcoholic/attic and being one I know the feeling of a good pain pill or lots of them lol. This has to have a reaction to some medications. I can barely walk to the fridge to get water_ thinking it might help_ the next morning. It was closing my eyes like I was going to sleep but not sleeping after I took it_ slept through the night ok then this severe vertigo that I hope goes away soon. Truly the worst trip I've been on and have been on a few in my lifetime. Missing out on work again today that I am behind on from the diverticulitis that has a deadline for people to have Thanksgiving in the home they bought that every contractor that remodeled it_ even the guy overseeing it_ f****** up stomach is growling as I'm typing I hope the vomiting or sh*** don't start now. FDA needs to check side effects when taken with different medicines. If I move my head laying down its vertigo laying down_ how the hell does that happen. crazy feeling I've never had and even scary_ hoping it goes away. You've probably already taken it and have problems or are on a good high if your reading this_ good luck!!,,M,55,1  days1-2 4hrs,11/20/2015,Talwin

7, 1, Car accident_ mri noted ls probs,irritability_ hot flashes_ fast/irregular heartbeat_ tremors_ nausea,it did not diminish pain whatsoever.  i was concerned when i saw it used to be widely abused but it's beyond me why anyone would want to take this drug.  i do not usually take narcotics so i have a low tolerence for them and this provided no relief at all but felt like being in a nightmare the last time i took a dose.  i would NEVER take this prescription again.,F,40,1.5  days50mg 3X D,10/3/2013,Talwin

9, 1, Surgery on finger,Extreme nausea and vomiting.,My Doctor recommended taking this medication immediately after my surgery. (Stay ahead of the pain). I followed his instructions even though I wasn't in any pain. Immediately after taking one pill_ I became sick and vomited.  I waited the required hours before taking the second pill_ which caused the same reaction. I will NEVER take this medication again.,F,63,1  days 2X D,7/11/2012,Talwin

13, 4, 1. Shoulder injury_ 2. Depression,Taking a full 50 mg pill leads to increasing disorientation and tiredness. 1/4 pill (12.5 mg) usually has no side effects except the occasional upset stomach.,Although I started with Talwin for pain (worked very well)_ I have mainly used it (unprescribed) to help with depression. I am also on anti-depressants. When I am extremely depressed and non-functional_ 1/4 pill (12.5 mg) gets me out of it. There is the temptation to continue taking 1/4 pills_ but I can limit it to 2/day for 3-4 days. By then_ I'm ok.,F,48,10  years12.5 2X D,7/13/2010Email,Talwin

16, 5, Gunshot Wound to shoulder,I had no side effects at all using this. I was taking so many vicodin 750 that I had major allergic reaction.,This is the best pain killer I have ever used and did not make me stupid or dizzy or high.. If you are in severe pain and I mean severe_ this works wonderful without any side effects used as prescribed. Also because I took 1 per day and it killed pain all day til the next morning_ I had no withdrawals.,F,43,5  months,7/13/2008Email,Talwin

19, 5, severe pain (kidney stones),Talwin takes the edge off the pain for me but doesn't have the mental confusion side effects many narcotics have for me.  I can still function on it.,I have had probably half a dozen or more Talwin prescriptions since my twenties and prefer it to Percocet or Vicodin_ which make me nauseated.  I have never taken it longer than three or fours days at a time_ however.  I keep it on hand for horseback riding injuries.,F,53,30  years,10/28/2007,Talwin
20, 5, back pain,Do not drive until medicine wears off.  Similar to 3 martinis.,My back hurt for 2 years_ related to deformed vertebra. I slept next to a back brace which I needed to strap on before I could stand up. Over 2 years_ doctors prescribed a long list of medicines which only ruined my digestion.  A new doctor prescribed Talwin for 6 weeks.  Following 6 week course_ back pain remained gone and has since been kept under control with regular exercise and occasional use of Talwin_ a couple pills per year.,M,40,6  weeks,10/17/2007,Talwin
21, 1, infection from bone graft in finger,Fever_ extreme nausea & vomiting (even with food)_ heart racing_ extreme dizziness & vertigo_ couldn't sleep but was in this weird 1/2-dream state with really fast & often disturbing images/thoughts. It's supposed to last 4 hours but after 8 hours I could barely stand.,This was the worst medicine experience I've ever had! I'd much rather have the pain_ & I hate pain. It takes longer to metabolize than stated on the label (in my case & it looks like some others_ too).  I switched to plain old regular Tylenol... scared of pain killers at this point.,F,30,1  days,10/11/2007,Talwin

The Doctor said put these on your allergic list.,I reccomend that you do not buy this.,F,68,2  days,6/22/2006Email,Talwin
25, 5, Dry Socket - tooth extraction,I am highly codeine intolerant.  I was in such pain from a condition I got after a tooth extraction called Dry Socket that the dentist called the pharmacist and he recommended this.  Combined with a few Advil it got me through the nightmarish pain I was in with no bad side effects at all. It had a relaxing effect which was helpful due to the pain I was in.  It was a lifesaver for me but I could see how it would be addictive over a long period of time due to the relaxing effects the drug has.  I am glad to have finally found a painkiller that actually works for me though_ to be taken only when I really need it!,,F,45,7  days,4/13/2006,Talwin

31, 1, abdominal pain,vomited for 6 hours until it wore off. mild hallucinations (waking nightmares?). The vomiting was so painful to my already-sore abdomen that it counteracted the pain relieving effects.
