0, 2, Heart palpitations and hbp,Horrible medication_ am now getting off it_ I hope the damage is not irreversible. Am on 4 medications for sudden onset labile high blood pressure_ tribezor and aldactone_ last 4 years. Developed heart palpitations after the death of my mother in May_ with adrenaline rushes and bp of 220/105. Doctor said I was going to have a stroke. Wanted to put me on Coreg but had tried that 2 years ago and had horrible side effects_ pounding heart_ shaking and tinnitus. Doctor insisted I needed to go on Bystolic_ initially resisted but gave in after two weeks. I shouldn't have! After about 3 days_ developed numbness in hand_ muscle pain in arm_ (feels sore like I had a flu shot)_ such severe pain in leg and hip I have a hard time getting up in the morning. After 1 week_ called PA and she cut in half to 5 mg. pain didn't go away_ couldn't get heart rate up during exercise. After another 2 weeks_ I cut it in half again_ but symptoms didn't go away. Hand numb all the time_ arm and leg ache_ having cramps in calves_ and 2 nights ago_ developed very severe itching and broke out in hives! Called PA today_ she wanted to switch me to Toprel_ (I had bad tinnitus with that one 4 years ago)_ I said NO. Beta blockers are the drugs from hell. She's doing blood work_ but told me to take 2.5 mg every other day for a week - but yo expect rebound HBp and more heart palpitations!! My cardio is going to yell at me when I see him next month - but I'll yell back. And NO more beta blockers!,,F,64,1  days10,8/12/2016,Bystolic
1, 3, High blood pressure_ arrhythmia,Panic attacks_ anxiety_ bursts of adrenaline feelings_ weakness_ headache_ visual disturbances,I was on 5mg of bystolic up until about 2 weeks ago. This was a switch from atenolol. This drug does a much better job with blood pressure but the 5mg made bp and heart rate very low. Started with unexplained panic attacks and a visual disturbance that sent me to the ER. Cut dosage in half. Feeling better than I did on the 5 mg but my doctor did not feel it was the medication. I disagree. Never had problems with sudden panic and anxiety. Time for a new doctor. Listen to your own body. You know it better than anyone.,F,45,3  months2.5 mg,7/23/2016,Bystolic
2, 3, Blood pressure and arrhythmia,Seems to increase episodes of arrhythmia.,My top number concerning my blood pressure was still too high. I went from a resting heart rate of over 100 to around 76 and up to 83. Doctor reassured me that it should not increase my arrhythmia problems if I increased dosage to 20MG but it seems its only slowing my heart significantly and not resolving and other issues.,F,37,3  days20MG,7/13/2016Email,Bystolic
3, 3, Blood Pressure,Powerful medication! On 5mg many side effects...fatigue.....weakness.......depression....But blood pressure way down 117/69.

4, 4, Heartbeat high,Very tired. Numbness in my arms and shoulders_ joint pain_ especially in hands and knees.  Mild dizziness_ vision seems worse.  Mild nausea.  Not sure if any of it is related to Bystolic_ but I don't take any other medications or supplements or vitamins.  The comments here have made me a bit nervous.  I don't want to have a stroke_ but I'm not completely comfortable with taking this med.,,F,49,6  months5mg 1X D,6/27/2016,Bystolic
5, 1, Pre-hypertension 135/90,Shoulder pains_ extreme tiredness_ abdominal pains close to ribs on right and left_ chest pains_ hard to breathe_ wrist pains_ anxiety_ weight gain.,My blood pressure always ran slightly high and I certainly have white-coat syndrome. I was prescribed Bystolic 5mg which did not affect my BP_ so was increased to 10mg where I remained for nearly a year. I felt detached from reality and walked around in a constant daze even though taking my dosage at night. Only a hour after being awake_ I would fight to keep my eyes open. My sleep was not affected by this drug. My blood pressure pleased the doc_ but the side effects where too much to handle. I told my doc I was weaning off_ so he gave me a week's supply of 5mg samples and told me to monitor my BP. After the week of 5mg_ I would be off the drug. That was 8 days ago and I have started feeling a bit like my old self again. I still have periods of anxiety_ but not constant like when taking the meds. Looking forward to the rest of the symptoms to go away completely as it seems they tend to come on for a short period and then go away. No longer feeling like a zombie or a prisoner to this drug. For the past eight days of being off this medication_ my BP has consistently averaged 123/78 with HR 72. I am starting on an exercise regimen since I no longer feel like I am fighting to breathe. While on Bystolic my weight shot up from 195 to 235. This med was not for me and I urge you to have a lengthy conversation with your medical care professional before starting down the Bystolic road...it was a long road for me.,M,46,1  years10mg 1X D,5/31/2016Email,Bystolic
6, 1, HTN_ a-fib,apathy_ decreased kidney function_ leg edema_ insomnia_ weight gain_ cold feet and legs and hands_ inability to function at ANYTHING memory problems,Bystolic not only decreases the ability of my heart to function_ it also decreases blood circulation to my kidneys AND brain.  Until this beast entered into my life_ I rode my horse_ did my own home remodeling and basically enjoyed living.  I was amazingly stupid to allow this poison into my body.  This is not living_ this is sitting in a chair waiting to die.,F,66,13  months5 1X D,5/2/2016,Bystolic
7, 2, High blood pressure,I've been on bystolic 10 mg in the evening with another drug in the morning with a water pill every other day.  Dr switched me to 10 mg of bystolic in the morning and 10 in the evening with a water pill. I am feeling weak  legs are weak insomnia and shortness of breath.  I never had any of this when I wasn't taking meds. I know I need to because of my bp but I don't know how much more I could take. Feeling like an invalid spend most of my days sitting around. Never had this before! Seeing md Friday which I know already he will tell me I'm crazy. I never had any of these symptoms before meds. Please help!!,,F,63,3  months20mg,4/26/2016Email,Bystolic
8, 1, High Blood Pressure,Heavy depression and extreme anxiety.,I just wanted to update my rating from October of last year.  I was on Benicar and had anxiety and depression.  The doctor put me on Bystolic.  In October_ everything was great and I rated it a 5.  Another month went by and I started having the same symptoms as I did on Benicar; extreme anxiety and heavy depression.  In December_ I insisted the doctor put me back on Lisinopril and my symptoms have disappeared.  My BP is right on track and I have not been depressed or had one bout of anxiety since then.,M,47,4  months10 MG 1X D,4/21/2016Email,Bystolic

12, 5, Hypertension_ palpitations_ anxiety,The first month I noticed some hair loss and itchy skin but they both went away.,I tried Metoprolol and Bisoprolol but I could hardly function on them. I take Bystolic at bedtime and get a good night's sleep but it does not make me drowsy if I don?t go to bed right away. It did at first but this changed after a few weeks. As well_ it has helped my anxiety tremendously. Although I still get some palpitations_ they are hardly noticeable.

15, 2, Tachycardia_ high BP,Terrible diarrhea_ bad nausea. But the worst thing was what it did to me mentally. Heavy depression_ broke down sobbing_ for no reason I could think of_ every time I was alone. Depressed and had suicidal thoughts (uncharacteristic for me) and very irritable. Very tired in a depressed sort of way. I felt like aliens were controlling my mind.,The only reason I gave it a 2 is because it did lower my BP_ but too much. Now I am off the med and feel normal again. The cause of the BP turned out to be chronic pain_ which has resolved now_ so I don't need a beta-blocker anymore.,F,46,5  days5 mg,2/26/2016,Bystolic
16, 5, Hypertension,Fatigue_ cold sensitivity_ cold hands and feet_ mild lightheadedness on occasion.,My MD and I are satisfied with how Bystolic is working for me.  My BP now ranges in the 110s/70s from 150s and 160s/90s.  Because of the fatigue_ I take my dose in the evening.  If I'm pretty active after my dose_ the fatigue doesn't set in_ but definitely does once my activity level drops.  Not having any insomnia.  We will keep evaluating_ but it's working wonderfully for me right now.  No_ I'm not a paid spokesperson - it really is working well for me.,F,53,1  years5MG 1X D,2/25/2016,Bystolic

I drink a lot of water anyway_ but I was to ""push the fluids"" along with the magnesium. I feel centered and calm--no rushing in my ears or inability to find the right words. I feel very good.

After having chronic insomnia for multiple years_ I'm finally getting decent sleep. I feel that Bystolic has positive effects on my cognition_ mood and attention as well_ probably due to it's positive effects on nitric oxide_ which is very much involved in neurotransmitter function.
