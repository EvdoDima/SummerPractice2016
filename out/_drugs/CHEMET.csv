0, 3, Mercury Toxicity,"I never had Fibromyalgia before but since I have taken the greater doses (100MG every 4 hours) I have suffered from profound neuro pain in the chest_ flank_ & back.  My protocol is to take the Succimer (DMSA) every 3 to 4 hours for 5 days and then take 9 days off.  While taking the DMSA I feel like I have the flu with much incessant aching and suffer from a pronounced raspy cough.  Following a course of treatment the flu symptoms go away but the Fibromyalgia like symptoms increasingly flare up over the days; I suspect because of what is called ""redistribution of mercury"" as the blood level of the DMSA is gradually cleared; however the raspy cough subsides.",Chemet (DMSA which is also known as Succimer) apparently is the least nephrotoxic of the available chelating agents and that is why I so far have endured its most unpleasant side effects.  Some weeks of the aforementioned protocol I add 50MG of Alpha Lopiec Acid (Q 4 hours) to the protocol and this appears to cause the side effects to spike!,M,62,1  years100MG 6X D,5/8/2014Email,Chemet
