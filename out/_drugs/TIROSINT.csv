0, 1, Hypothyroid,Tremors_ crippling knee pain_ muscle spasms_ depression_ body aches_ neuralgia_ some shortness of breath_ some suicidal thoughts.,Have been on this medication for 12 weeks.  Was originally on Generic Levo and had no major problems.  6 weeks in on Tirosint and my foot began to ache and I walked with a limp.  By 7 weeks_ I had very painful & constant neuralgia and dull aching in both feet;this continued into 11 weeks.  9 -10 weeks in and I developed weakness in one knee.  12 weeks and the pain in both knees has become crippling (sharp_ cramp-like_ aching and constant).  I have discontinued use and am hoping for improvement once the medication leaves my system. Joint/knee pain is listed as a 'rare' side effect of this drug_ I didn't realize the pain would be crippling.  Still hoping to recover when this leaves my system.  I wish the doctors would be more forthcoming about the chances of debilitating side effects_ but I suppose these meds do perform well for some people.,F,40,12  weeks25 mcg 1X D,10/20/2015Email,Tirosint
1, 4, Hypothyroid,TSH of 8.2 down to 4.8 in less than 2 weeks.  Skin started peeling_ had and reflux_ and a pulse of 120.  My Endo pulled me off.  I must say that despite those three things on Tirosint my vision cleared along with the brain fog and depression and anxiety. Starting to think side effects from Tirosint were really the effects of being hypothyroid.  Will be asking Doc if I can try it again once I'm stable,,F,46,2  weeks50 mg,7/23/2015Email,Tirosint
2, 5, Hypothyroid,None.,I had very bad side effects with levothyroxine so my doctor provided me samples of tirosint.  BEST idea ever - my TSH level went from 17 down to 4.5.  It takes about 2 weeks to start working but magic no pain no coldness no brittle hair nothing that's part of being hypo. =],F,27,8  months85,2/23/2015,Tirosint
3, 3, hypothyroid,nausea_ bloating_ dry skin_ anxiety,"I wanted to give tirosint a try because I am extremely sensitive to ""fillers"" in medications. I am allergic to milk and was trying to find a drug that was free of lactose. Tirosint  seemed perfect because it contains no extra ""fillers"". works well for a few days and then the side effects kick in. I think I will go back to synthroid because the anxiety on tirosint is ridiculous. Disappointed because I expected it to work better than it did.",F,38,3  months100mcg 1X D,8/9/2014Email,Tirosint
