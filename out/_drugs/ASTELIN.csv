1, 2, Allergic Rhinitis & ETD,Drowsiness - got worse after 3rd day - could hardly stay awake at work!Dizzy!   started 3rd day and got worse each day after.   Anxiety....feeling jittery at times....legs felt weak.  Sneezing!Mild nausea feeling started after 7 or 8 days,also noticed small amounts of dried blood in nostril each morning although no nose bleeds.  Noticed muscle aches_ especially in joints and neck_ after a week. Definitely seemed to help ease the sinus pressure_ but after doesn't seem to be doing anything at all for the Eustachian tube dysfunction.,M,54,9  days2 puffs 1X D,10/28/2015,Astelin
2, 2, Allergic Rhinitis,I was prescribed Astelin after had a major allergy attack. It really did help it worked about seven days after I started it I developed chest pain. I do have a history of coronary spasms. I took my nitro four times the day it first happened. I looked up side effects and became wary. I  Took it again several days later when I was going to be exposed to something I'm really allergic to. Five hours later I was driving and had crushing chest pain. I will never take it again be wary of it if you have any type of cardiac history. I have not had any chest pain since I stopped it. By the way I hadn't had any chest pain for over year when that happened my cardiologist does believe it is connected,My dose was two sprays each nostril,F,40,2  weeks205.5mcg,9/17/2015,Astelin

5, 1, Allergies & sinus,I'd used this previously but stopped because of taste and bp issues. Restarted because of severe allergies. Wish I had never done it! Was so exhausted and the worst was that it sent my BP way up_ 160/89. I also had an increase in heart rate that was a scary thing - 100+ beats per minute. NEVER again! It's been a miserable day and I won't repeat it!  Be very careful when you decide to use this medicine. Read the list of side effects in detail. Reviews and post marketing are the only ones that mention this as an issue. ,,F,58,1  days,7/1/2015,Astelin
6, 2, allergies,Tried this medication once in the evening. It stopped my skin from feeling itchy but it caused some pretty severe depression and then I conked out.  :P  I can't deal with depression or passing out like that and the allergies came back full force the following morning.,,F,38,1  days1 squirt 2X D,5/7/2015Email,Astelin
7, 4, non allergic vasular rhinitis,Works better than anything I have used but I am exhausted.  I have never had an issue with sleepiness from drugs_ even benedryl does not give me problems_ but this drug makes me feel like I should sleep 20 hours a day,I have had vascular non allergic rhinitis since I was young and it has gotten worse with age_ making me feel like I have a continual cold/sinus infection.   I am allergic to weather/barometer changes which causes migraines/ strong smells and I believe I also have allergic rhinitis and hayfever.  Most of the time I feel like I have a horrible cold.  This has really helped but I can't handle the sleepiness or the lack of ambition.  I take it only at night now and use flonase during the day_ but I still am tired.  If I quit taking it_ the exhaustion disappears_ but the symtoms of the rhinitis become horrible.,F,66,4  weeks30 mg 2X D,10/17/2014Email,Astelin

9, 1, vasomotor rhinitis,Terrible aching pains - deep_ unremitting muscles aches in the calves of both legs within 2 days of starting this medicine_ spreading to the backs of the knees_ the thigh muscles and the hips within the first week. It took 2 weeks for the pains to dissipate after stopping it.,It was insidious - my legs started aching immediately - a deep dull ache in the muscles - mainly the calves at first. I had driven 400 miles and thought it dehydration or just sitting for too long. And then it got worse and worse until on day 7 it was literally agony_ I thought I had a DVT but it was both legs - the calves_ behind the knees (deep in them)_ up through the thighs and into the hips. Deep_ unremitting_ terrible pain. I could hardly sleep at night.It wasn't until day 7 that the penny dropped and I realized that it might be this medicine. I came to this site and saw other people had been similarly affected. I stopped it and prayed that the symptoms would dissipate. It it took a full 2 weeks for the aching to go away. A little every day - 5-10% - until finally it was gone.The effects of the spray as a decongestant weren't so remarkable - it didn't work very well in that regard.,F,63,7  days2 squirts 2X D,9/30/2014,Astelin

Side effects were much worse than what the medicine was supposed to cure.,Worked decently for my nasal drip and I was pretty happy 1-2 days in. Then I started getting muscle twitches and soon the other side effects followed. Didn't realize that it was the Astelin causing it until later after which I ceased the medicine. The blood pressure subsided and anxiety was reduced (but not back to normal). Twitches subside but still exist.,M,,3  months 1X D,10/12/2013,Astelin

14, 1, post nasal drip,Three months into taking Astelin I experienced anxiety_ paranoia_ and high blood pressure.  I went off for two weeks and things cleared up; I had such bad allergies I took it again for five days and the symptoms came back.  I also lost a lot of my sense of smell and taste while taking Astelin.,The FDA drug study on Astelin is a joke.  250 people took it for 30 days???  That is a study in stupidity.,M,33,3.5  months2 sprays 1X D,2/26/2013Email,Astelin

I didn't mind the bitter taste - it is a medication after all - but it felt as if my symptoms were getting worse_ including incessant coughing at night. I didn't even put the severe heart palpitations and the super-weird dreams together with the Azelastine use before I read the comments other people left here... I am not a morning person to begin with but now it is almost impossible to get out of bed in the morning.

21, 4, Allergies,I sometimes had a burning in my throat and almost always a burning in my nose (probably due to the citric acid in it).  However_ it really stopped the sneezing and really helped out with allergy-related fatigue.,This product does not contain sucralose_ as Astepro does_ so I feel more comfortable taking it.  Astepro is sweeter than Astelin_ but it's due to the sucralose in it.

But my major problem is post-nasal drip and that has not significantly improved.Cons: Hunger is so bad I can't think about anything other than food.

23, 1, allergies,I took Astelin for 3 days but had to stop due to unexplained muscle jerks and twitching.  Stopping the medicine did not stop the side effects_ they became much worse.  They are now so severe I have to take 2 different meds to control them and have to visit my neurologist every 6 months.  I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this side effect.,I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone!!!  3 neurologists and alot of money later_ I have them about 90% under control.  This is a life long effect which I am hoping does not get worse over time.,F,47,3  days 1X D,7/22/2011Email,Astelin
24, 4, post-nasal drip,No bad taste experienced_ but it made me drowsy_ and feeling as if I had a general anesthetic a couple of hours earlier.  This drug evidently crosses the blood-brain barrier.  I thought that only first generation antihistamines were supposed to do that.  Too risky.  Comments here pretty scary.  I'll use in future only if desperate.,Very effective elimination of post-nasal drip_ which had been with me for several months.  The PND had been affecting my breathing by dripping into the bronchial passages.  However_ I still feel a little short of breath. I don't know if that's due to the drug or because there's some pre-existing bronchial constriction in sync with the nasal congestion. At least I've established that my PND is curable.,M,54,3  days 2X D,11/6/2010,Astelin

31, 3, Chronic sinusitis,I initially tolerated Astelin quite well. It made me tired at work but nothing a cup of tea wouldn't fix. After a year an half_ I suddenly began experiencing a sensation as if I didn't have enough oxygen in my system. After discontinuing all medications_ I began to re-introduce them one at a time. After the first dose of Astelin_ I began experiencing the same sensation. I discontinued use of Astelin and was fine. Unfortunately_ nothing worked quite as well as Astelin with my sinusitis. They introduced a new version of it so my doctor gave me a sample_ thinking it may have been some particular ingredient in the original that may have been changed in the new version. He was wrong. After the first dose_ I began experiencing the same lack of oxygen sensations. I have not used it since.,It was great while it lasted but it seems I developed a hyper-sensitivity to it after having used it successfully for a long period of time.,M,53,2  years1 spray ea 1X D,9/29/2010,Astelin

Astelin has worked wonderfully well at preventing any allergic attacks so far this season and I have had NO trouble breathing.  It took approximately 1 month of use before any side effects occurred_ and since I currently take NO other medications and am in generally good health_ I can only attribute my recent problems with Astelin.  I am an RN and have been researching my symptoms day in and day out_ only to end up on numerous medications for a ""migraine"" that has lasted over 10 days.  I decided to stop taking ALL medications last night and am just finally free of pain in my head.  I will not be taking Astelin anymore.  I am sure this medicine is wonderful for some_ but the side effects just are not worth the freedom from allergies for me.

I have a very bad nose(deviated septum) and have always had problems from allergies(grass_ceder_pets).  Not until i tried to wing myself off of astelin is when i noticed i am having heart palpitations.  I have been a college athlete and know my body very well...Do have some history of overweight grandpa with irregular heartbeat.  I am 26 and i am in tremendous shape.  Prolonged use of Astelin has turned out to be a very scary thing for me.,I have been tired at work_ but do not think astelin is the culprit_ many people(me) have sleep apnea that also suffer from extreme allergies and deviated septum.the Heart Palpitations is consistent in my experience.  Not until my third 30 ML bottle_ did i start to experience the irregular heart beat.  I run and weight train close to 5 days a week and have been a collegiate athlete as little as three years ago.

35, 1, non-allerginic rhinitis,I'm the one who described having Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms after taking Astelin for 6 weeks.  The symptoms are still on-going_ though lessened a bit.  Turns out my body is only mimicking RA.  It is also mimicking another auto-immune_ inflammation response: Lichen Planus.  With this disease I get white webbing through the tissue under my tongue.  This is the only fatal form of the disease and I have had a small chunk of my tongue cut out for biopsy.  My mother also took Astelin for a couple of months.  Her body is also mimicking RA.  Looks like we'll both have the extreme pain and fatigue of RA for life.  Plus_ with the Lichen Planus I'll have to be screened for cancer once a year.  The thing I don't get is if my lab work shows that my body is only mimicking these two auto-immune_ inflammation responses_ why won't the symptoms go away now that I'm no longer taking the Astelin.,Has ruined both mine and my mother's lives.,M,52,6  weeksmaximum 2X D,6/28/2010Email,Astelin

45, 5, Post nasal drip after nasal infect.,None.,I had a bad sino-bronchial infection. Even after I was cured of that_ I had very bad post nasal drip. Astelin was amazingly effective in clearing up the post nasal drip. I used 2 sprays per nostril twice a day until I was out of the 200-spray bottle. I held my head down for a few minutes after the sprays_ to assure I did not taste the bitter taste. This is a wonderful drug in my opinion.  It cost me $50 co-pay since it is a brand drug_ but it was worth every penny. Note: I don't have any allergies_ so this use of the drug was for inflammation left over from a nasal infection.

It is too expensive_ dangerous and the only time that I wasn't severly affected by the drowsiness was when I only squirted the orange liquid in one nostril and leaned forward while I gently breathed in through that clogged nostril. I used this product a grand total of 3 times. I was perscribed this by a new doctor and she told me to just ""try it out"" and she also perscribed me Atarax which also causes drowsiness_ the combination of the two often causes upper respirator issues and I have enough of those already. I couldn't even notice if it actually worked because it seemed that all I could do was sit on my bed at home and twitch. The only time I will ever use it again is if I get so sick that I can't breathe through either one of my nostrils.",F,16,2  days,10/10/2009,Astelin

57, 4, Chronic nasal allergies,I take it only when my condition gets very bad. I take one spray in each nostril. Makes me very drowsy and so I take it at night only. While the sleep is always good_ it also produces vivid dreaming. Fortunately they are good dreams. Last night's were beautiful_ including wonderful landscapes _ exquisite architecture_ subdued colors_ festive people_ etc.etc. Only bad was a friend in trouble. But everything is sooo  realistic_ it was amazing. That is why I googled Astelin side-effects this morning and here I am!,If it works take it only when absolutely necessary. The other unpleasant side-effects like bitter taste_ temporarily sore sinus and nasal-passages  are outweighed by the relief_ unlike say Benadryl which leaves me almost disabled with drowsiness and long period of lethargic malaise.,M,63,2  years,9/30/2009,Astelin
