0, 1, To avoid pregnancy,Weight gain in all the wrong places,"I took Modicon a year ago for only a month or two before I discontinued using it. I wasn't dating anyone at the time and did not have sex in the couple of months I was taking Modicon. I stopped taking it due to undesirable weight gain. I'm a very petite girl (5'1_ normally 95 to 100 lbs) with very high metabolism and I do not gain weight easily. Within a few weeks of taking Modicon_ my face got rounder/fatter and my arms got bigger. A couple of my friends and even my mom commented on how I looked ""different"" and I could see it when I looked at myself in pictures. I hated the way I looked with a fuller face and bigger arms_ and I shot up to about 105 lbs (very unusual for me). Since I wasn't having sex at the time and didn't need BC_ I stopped taking it completely. I didn't change anything else about my lifestyle and about a month after I stopped Modicon_ my weight went back to normal and my face and arms thinned out again. I have remained 100 lbs or less since! I just started Loestrin 1/20.. hopefully the lower estrogen level means no weight gain!",F,24,30  days 1X D,12/13/2013Email,Modicon 21

2, 2, Birth Control,When I firswt started taking this pill_ the first week_ nothing seemed different. Then I started feeling very bloated_ I gained about 5lbs. and had no appetite and felt nauseous.I usually go to the gym (for the past two years) daily_ but couldnt go_ and if I tried_ I felt severly tired and dizzy.I have depression_ and this seemed to multiply it_ to where I couldnt get out of bed in the morning and felt disconnected.I have acne_ and it seemed to help that (the only positive effect).This is the third pill I have tried_ and the low dose pills seem to make me blled during the regular pills and not on the sugar. I also noticed I couldnt wear my contact when taking this pill_ my eyes simply rejected them when I tried to put them in.,,M,24,20  days,3/23/2008Email,Modicon 21
