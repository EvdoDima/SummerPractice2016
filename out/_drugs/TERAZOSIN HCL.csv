0, 4, High Blood Pressure,I ate some salty olives and my feet began to swell badly. When I stopped the extra salt_ the swelling went away.,Dr. told me this med was to reduce swelling in the prostrate and that one of the side effects is that HBP is reduced. It did create a stronger stream and did reduce my BP about 30 points with no adverse side effects yet.,M,73,30  days1 1X D,4/6/2011Email,Terazosin hcl
