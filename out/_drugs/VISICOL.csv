0, 1, Prep for colonoscopy,"Warning! It nearly killed me. I'm a healthy 52 yr old woman. I was sitting down and A few minutes after taking the 20th pill_ I told my husband I didn't feel very good_ and lost consciousness. I tried to stand up and I passed out again. He called the paramedics. They sat me in a chair_ then I heard them say ""We are losing her"" next thing I know I was in the hospital.  After 7 bags of IV fluids_ potassium pills and 4 days in the hospital_ my potassium and heart rate came back. This was two weeks ago_ and I still don't feel well. Avoid this medication. Very dangerous. It was very difficult to find a pharmacy to fill this bad medicine. Not many carry it. No one I know has used this method. Now I know why. I wish I would have been warned. I hope no one else has to go through what I did.",Visicol tablets are dangerous to your health.,M,52,1  days,10/9/2007Email,Visicol

No pain at all.,I'd read about electrolyte disturbances after taking this drug_ so I prepared for it by making sure I was fully hydrated before-hand and that I took it with fluids that contained electrolytes (Propel_ Gatorade_ Apple Juice).  It's a lot of pills to take_ but they were no larger than my Vitamin C tablet I take daily_ so not hard to swallow.  I started getting results 45 minutes after taking the first pills_ and it lasted for several hours afterward - around 5 hours from start to when I stopped getting the urge to have a BM.  My procedure was scheduled for the afternoon_ so I did the first round at 5pm the night before_ then started up the second round at 5am the next morning.  I didn't feel dehydrated at all afterward.  This drug can also put a heavy load on your kidneys_ so I continued drinking fluids for the entire 5 hours to insure there would be some extra fluids available for my kidneys.  Most of what you drink with the prep is sucked out by your colon_ so I feel it's important to,F,43,2  days,12/2/2005,Visicol
