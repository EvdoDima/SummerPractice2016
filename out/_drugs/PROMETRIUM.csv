0, 3, Short luteal phase/ttc,Dizziness and drowsiness which wasn't a big deal since it was taken at bedtime. Minor mood swings which could also be related to impending period.,I was put on it to lengthen my luteal phase. I would start spotting 6-7 days past ovulation. The only thing progesterone supplements did was lengthen it by two days. On 9 days past ovulation_ I began spotting again anyways.,F,36,9  days200mg/day,8/7/2016,Prometrium

4, 4, Heavy_ irregular bleeding_perimenopause,Day1: very tiredDay 2: fatigue_ headache_ drowsy_ VERY vivid odd dreams_ nauseaDay 3: I debated whether or not to stop - read all reviews here and decided to try it one more night since it's a weekend and I only have 5 total pills.  I changed what I did based on what one other user reported and took it with an entire glass of water.  I don't know if that is what did the trick_ but I woke up feeling AMAZING!!  I still had the vivid dreams and also now have some breast tenderness_ but no drowsy_ fatigue_ headache or nausea.  I feel almost euphoric and at total peace.  I will take it again tonight and should I need to update this review_ I will.,,F,43,3  days100mg 1X D,2/21/2016,Prometrium
5, 1, Not menstruating/Not menopausal,Had no side effects for first 6 days_ then had stroke-like (TIA) symptoms. Blurred-vision_ loss of balance_ muscle weakness_ inability to walk or talk_ complete fog. Didn't know why. Took Prometrium on day 7-nothing. Day 8-same stroke-like symptoms. Stopped taking med_ haven't had any other episodes.,Unfortunately_ those symptoms are listed as an severe allergic reaction. ,F,47,8  days200mg,2/6/2016Email,Prometrium
6, 4, My uterine lining is too thick,Extreme drunk like feeling_ dizzy...take it before bed time. Got up to use the bathroom and walked straight into our bookcase. This medication should have a warning on the label to not drive or operate heavy machinery.,Take it before bedtime.,F,40,10  days400mg 1X D,1/27/2016,Prometrium
7, 5, Regulate cycles,The drug make me feel a little fuzzy. I also have some bloating and other gi discomfort.,I take this medication on days 17-28 of my cycle. For the first time in my life I have a regular cycle. My periods are also not as heavy. This medication has worked well for me.,F,35,10  days200,1/13/2016,Prometrium
8, 5, for migraine headaches,I would have  a migraine 24 hours before my period would start... clearly hormonal.  My naturopath put me on this and it makes all the difference!  No more migraines!,,F,47,12  years100 1X D,1/3/2016Email,Prometrium
9, 5, Perimenopause,Indigestion_ drowsiness_ leg pain.,Was prescribed 200mg but started off taking half that dose (100mg). I was getting maybe 4-6 hours of broken sleep every night_ horrible night sweats_ insomnia_ irritability_ foggy brain. Since taking Prometrium I am sleeping like a baby! It's AMAZING! I take it 30 min before bed and I'm up in the morning feeling refreshed and energetic. Hot flashes are gone. I was 3-5 lbs overweight (I am 5'3 and weighed 126 which was heavy for my frame) and I'm down 4 lbs in 2 months. No bloating. Hair is nice and thick. I swear this medication is a Godsend for me. I had a tubal ligature after my 3rd child at 32 and I haven't felt this good since before I had kids. Seems like the issue is really hitting the right dose. Taking 200 mg gave me bad indigestion and leg cramps. Since I lowered the dose it seems to be perfect. Also I think you need to give your body time to get used to it.,F,40,2  months200,12/22/2015Email,Prometrium
10, 3, Hrt,I start spotting every time I begin the 10 day cycle for the progesterone part. I thought cycling would help clear the thicker lining.I don't know what the best dosage is for me.Can I use prometrium capsules intravaginally? Would I absorb it better?,I am wondering if I am absorbing it. I have had endometrial hyperplasia with Vivelle dot.075 patch and have also been on continuous prometrium. My osteoarthritis in feet_ hands and back have increased over the last 2 yrs.I am so frustrated.,F,68,10  years100,10/17/2015Email,Prometrium
11, 1, Pre-menopausal,Dizziness_ sleepiness every day_ felt overly emotional_ unfocused.,Shortly after taking nightly dose_ I noticed my heart racing.  It was in the 130-140 bpm range and would not return to normal.  Finally had to go to ER for an intravenous dose of Lopressor to slow down the heart rate.,F,53,30  days200 mg 1X D,9/11/2015,Prometrium
12, 5, Extremely heavy bleeding_ anemia,Occasionally slightly dizzy after taking it.,I take it every few days to keep it in my system. Periods now heavy but not hemorrhaging. I cannot control it with any type of estrogen/progesterone birth control pill because of severe emotional side effects. I'm using the prometrium to try to avoid a surgery. In addition_ avoiding soy products helps.,F,50,1  years100 mg,9/7/2015,Prometrium

14, 5, Estrogen Dominance_ PMDD,1st & 2nd day dizziness_ increased ability to fall asleep(take night) Very calming_ helped quickly during the day with irritability & pmdd symptoms.,I have searched for interventions for PMDD. I found that I had very similar symptoms to estrogen dominance day 12-28. It was as if my pms started way early and my period took forever to relieve it. I would be extremely hungry_ angry_anxious_short with everyone_ gain weight_ extreme fatigue. I even thought I was Bipolar. Nope...it's balancing that good ol estrogen. Prometrium isn't able to lower current estrogen but cam help balance and that's the key. My husband and I agree it's already changed my life.,F,30,2  weeks200mg,5/5/2015Email,Prometrium
15, 1, to reestablish menstrual cycle,Fatigue_ dizziness_ feeling as if I'm drunk,Feeling lasts well beyond stopping the drugs,F,30,7  days400 mg,4/10/2015,Prometrium
16, 4, PMS/heavy period/estrogen dominance,-helps me fall asleep fast-morning wake up very groggy -during day sometimes feel very tired-minor cramping/tenderness in the uterus area at first_ since subsided,I take 25mg on days 6-14_ then 50mg days 15 to start of period before bedtime.I feel like I sleep deeper but then I wake up around 5am for some reason_ I normally can sleep through the night.  Sometimes I do feel very tired during the day_ but I think this happens when I increase to 50mg and take my dose too late the night before.No breast tenderness_ I have found it actually has helped my breast pain just before my period.  I started taking Prometrium just before my last period_ so I'm waiting for my next period to see if any changes w/ my flow_ PMS_ etc.  But overall_ I feel good on it so far.  Just notice more fatigue when I increase to 50mg and if I take it too late at night.I'm going to try to take it earlier at night_ maybe around 9pm.,M,35,1  months25mg 1X D,2/27/2015,Prometrium
17, 1, insomnia,Stroke like symptoms: unable to focus_ unable to walk.  Also expereinced painful breasts_ pain on right leg_ dizziness_ heart palpitations_ anxiety.,Warning--take upmost caution and do all research before considering this drug.  This was recommended to me by a Naturopath Doctor.  I made the mistake of not researching this drug before I took it_ and so thankful I did not start on a higher dose. I question that this drug is even on the market_ as in my opinion it should not be.,F,57,14  days100 mg 1X D,9/25/2014,Prometrium
18, 5, Menopause,Less muscle pain_ brain fog_ and improved fine motor skills / cognative function; some abdominal weight gain_ other weight gain (which I can live with since the pain and fine motor skills / cognative function have improved). I already take something to sleep (trazadone) so_ it really hasn't affected my sleep.,"Vivelle dot .50 mgs 2 X a week didn't help me very much by itself; doctor added Prometrium (100 mgs); no joy. Per ""The Estrogen Alternative: Natural Hormone Therapy with Botanical Progesterone"" [Raquel Martin]_ Progesterone ratio needs to be 125% to 1% for estrogen to be effective. Applied Prometrium topically 2 X and rotated location to areas of skin that is thin (forearm_ wrist_ tops of hands_ back of knees). Also_ now I just ""forget"" to use it; naturally cycle myself off. Interval between mood going to &^$# is getting longer and  intensity of  mood swings are less. Other things to also consider (as previously mentioned) is bio-identical thyroid medication (like Armour); and adrenal support (like Relora) and cortisol precursors like 7-keto DHEA and Pregnenolone. Yes_ I have gained weight_ but_ was not active nor eating a ""clean diet"" (craved carbs - sure sign of weak adrenals); sodium / potassium not balanced? Water retention less severe since eating 2 blended potassium rich meals every day (lots of resources for blended meals on web). And exercise has helped with burning fat. (It takes a lot more energy to burn fat after menopause -- see ""THE COMPLETE FIT or FAT"" by Covert Bailey (great section of menopause) or one of ""Zone"" exercise books / websites. You are NOT exercising as efficiently as you think you are because some exercises are not effective for burning fat as you might think!",F,55,180  days100 2X D,10/22/2013Email,Prometrium
19, 4, night sweats/peri-menopause,Drowsiness_ mild stomach cramps_ lethargy_ somewhat depressed_ mild headaches.  Had a period (I was told by my doctor that I shouldn't but it was at the beginning therefore waiting a while before worrying too much about this),I am hoping the drowsiness goes away as I am finding it hard to function. Unfortunately for me I had just started a new position and my head is in the fog.  When I first began taking it I couldn't wait to go home to go to bed.  I stopped going to the gym_ had no energy.  I have since gained weight_ mostly in the stomach area. On the upside_ since taking prometrium in combination with Estrogel_ my night sweats have all but disappeared.  I hadn't slept a full night in years.  Now I pass out before being able to count to 10.  I feel much better because I am getting some much needed sleep.  Will be taking HRT for the shortest possible length of time.  Just trying to get me through the rough spot I experienced.  Before taking HRT_ I was coping with acupuncture and homeopathic meds but in April_ the floodgates opened and my entire system just went crazy on me.  Night sweats were the worse (that and not sleeping a wink and trying to work full time).  I am going to continue taking it and hope that the negative side effects disappear after a while because the pros are better than the cons for me right now,F,52,30  days100 mg 1X D,6/20/2013Email,Prometrium
20, 4, Perimenopause,Side effects only when dosage is off. Initially I had some irritability and urinary/bladder irritation and not much help with insomnia and fatigue I was hoping for. Now that my dosage is right_ I dont have the side effects and it has helped with sleep_ bloating and fatigue.,I suggest anyone starting progesterone/prometrium start off at a low dose from compounding pharmacy. My first doctor put me on 100mg since that is the only dosage available unless you get it from compounding pharmacy. This was too high a dose and caused bad bladder irritation. I went to another doctor that prescribed progesterone in 25 mg dose so I could start out low and adjust as needed. I started on 50mg and didnt have side effects and it started helping with the bloating_ skin itching/dryness_ insomnia issues. When it started to lose efficacy_ I increased to 75mg_ and it worked well again. I am now taking 75-100 mg nightly with good results.  Helps a lot with bloating/PMS symptoms. I cant believe some doctors are starting people on 200mg -- no wonder the terrible side effects! You have to ramp up slowing with HRT as the body needs to get used to it. If you had a bad experience_ as I did initially_ I would suggest trying again starting on a low dose. It takes a good 30 days at least with all the bioidential hormone replacement for the body to adjust and it takes some tweaking. Its worth experimenting to get it right if you are having extreme perimenopausal issues as I am having. BHRT has helped my quality of life_ but it has required patience to get dosage right. Everyone is different and starting on lowest dose is best. You have to be your own doctor for the most part. Most doctors are ignorant and not very good at dealing with this issue...,F,44,6  months75-100mg 1X D,4/7/2013Email,Prometrium
21, 2, Menoupause symptoms,Racing heart_ numerous hot flashes_ insomnia_ jittery feeling into the next morning.,Tried this in combination with Divigel (estradiol) for mild menopause symptoms_ the worst of which is insomnia.  The very first night I took this I noticed side effects. It made my heart pound all night long and caused numerous hot flashes that woke me up every hour.  During the night_ I felt exausted_ dizzy and loopy yet I could not sleep.  I still felt jittery the next morning. Too afraid to feel that way another night_ so it's going right in the trash. Too bad_ because it's expensive! ,F,49,1  days100mg 1X D,2/8/2013,Prometrium
22, 3, Post menopausal symptoms,If you have side effects_ you may have high levels of progesterone due to drug-drug or drug-food interactions. DO NOT CONSUME GRAPEFRUIT PRODUCTS!,The CYP3A4 enzyme clears most of prescribed drugs (substrates) from your system. Check to see if any of your meds or supplements are CYP3A4 substrates and or if they are inhibitors of CYP3A4. Grapefruit stops the action of CYP3A4 gut enzymes completely in 30 minutes_ permanently and irreversibly. You renew the enzyme in over 24 hours_ so taking grapefruit products separately from your drugs does not help. When you can not clear substrates_ levels of them get too high and side effects_ even fatalities_ may occur. Many herbal supplements are CYP3A4 inhibitors as well. Do not take them. Ginkgo_ garlic_ turmeric_ for example. Research every substance for CYP3A4 interactions. Be well!,F,57, 100-200mg 1X D,1/27/2013Email,Prometrium
23, 1, Perimenopausal,OMG! I thought I was having a heart attack.  200mg Oral. Resting heart rate over 140 for 6-8 hours while sleeping_ over 100 the next day. Vomitting all night_ Sweating_ so weak had to be carried to bathroom. Headaches.Stopped taking immediately. Cannot imagine taking for 14 days.  Maybe it should have been a suppository at 200mg? on Estridot but goal was to create period.,,F,47,1  days200 mg 1X D,1/8/2013Email,Prometrium
24, 5, menopause,No adverse side effects observed,Sleep_ glorious sleep! I'm fairly certain this is the first time I have experienced a full night of uninterrupted sleep in over a year. I also have a greater sense of well-being. Very pleased indeed and hope I can take it forever!,F,51,7  days100 1X D,8/31/2012,Prometrium
25, 3, PCOS,"Extreme dizziness_ ""drunk"" feeling_ constant headache_ lethargy_ uncontrollable crying_ difficulty concentrating",I hate having to take it_ but it works in terms of helping me have a period. The first 2-3 days are the absolute worst. I can barely get out of bed and when I do_ I walk around in a daze and anything will make me cry. I tried the 100 mg dosage which had less severe side effects_ but I had to take them for a longer period of time (which I didn't like). So_ I sucked it up and went for the 200mg. I take it before bed to help with the dizziness_ but it still lingers the following day.,F,32,12  days200mg 1X D,8/31/2012Email,Prometrium

28, 1, menopauase with premarin,Nausea every day_ stomach irritation_ constipation_ HEADACHE_ pain in calves_ blurred vision_ sore _enlarged breasts.,It is hard to know for sure which drug is causing all these problems_ but I think it is the prometrium_ for the nausea and headache. It helped my depression_ but I can't tolerate the side effects at this time.  Will quit both and start to get rid of the side effects/,F,50,60  days100mg 1X D,8/7/2012Email,Prometrium

30, 3, Low Progesterone/TTC,Have to drink with a lot of water or it feels like it is sitting in my throat.  Then I start to feel jumpy and tingly_ eyes feel puffy- I just feel off after taking it.  Heart flutters also.  I do not feel sleepy after taking it_ but dr. told me to take it before bed.  Lay awake for a while.  Then I have really weird and vivid dreams of people_ places or thoughts from the day before.  Wake up after 5 hours in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. Do not feel tired in the morning.  I think it has opposite effect on me- makes me hyper.  Not loving this but taking it to higher progesterone levels and in case I do concieve.  I take it starting the third day after ovulation through day 12_ and I assume will cont. if get a PPT.,,F,28,4  days200 1X D,7/19/2012,Prometrium
31, 4, Panhypopituitarism,Strange dreams.  In this 3rd  week of taking_ I'm watching my stomach distend like a basketball.  I am hoping this is temporary.,Since becoming panhypopituitary (due to surgeries) in my 30's I lost all my hormones.  I had to replace and balance so many other hormones and vitamin deficiencies that the doctors were not ready to deal with the female hormones until everythign else was balanced.  That took almost seven years... seven years I would not wish on my worst enemy.  In my first week on this 100mg of Progesterone and an estrogen patch I felt like myself for the first time in years.  I slept without waking up 6 or 8 times like I had been doing and I could THINK clearly.  All the awful night sweats stopped and all the uncharacteristic despair and crying went away.  I no longer felt cold_ old and tired 24/7 and wan't getting flustered over stupid little things.  I even got a sense that my libido was returning.  All was wondeful but now it's the third week and I can no longer get into any of my pants.  If I see myself sideways in a mirror it looks like I swallowed a basketball.  I also could not sleep at all last night with those old aches and pains and woke up to two pimples and I haven't had a pimple since I was a teen.  I REALLY hope this is a temporary glitch because those 15 days/nights of feeling like my normal self again were the best gift I've ever received.,F,45,17  days100mg 1X D,6/29/2012,Prometrium
32, 5, perimenopause_ bleeding_ anxiety,In the beginning - lethargy_ depression_ drowsiness_ breast tenderness,The side effects were in the 1st month only. Now I take Prometrium 100 mg 12-14 days a month_ vaginally_ before going to bed. In the beginning I had to use some Estrogel to get out of the depression_ However using Estrogel led to extra bleeding/ spotting and anxiety_ so now I am using Prometrium only.Lack of progesterone in the perimenopause is the reason women get anxious because of estrogen fluctuations_ (Natural) progesterone down-regulates estrogen receptors thus reducing this sensitivity and diminishing anxiety.One more comment: progesterone creams and gels did not help me at all_ since progesterone_ unlike Estrogel_ is not absorbed by my skin. Vaginal way is the best way to take it_ also for endometrium protection.,F,49,3  months100 1X D,5/4/2012,Prometrium
33, 1, insomnia,Put on this by my naturopath so I assumed it was safe.  Foolish me!  Slept terrible and woke up with a raging headache_ nauseated and just feeling very strange.  Decided that since I don't tolerate meds well_ it isn't worth feeling awful 24/7 just to try to sleep better.  Threw it away and will never try HRT again--will go back to using my natural progesterone cream that doesn't have any side-effects.,,F,56,1  days100 mg 1X D,4/11/2012Email,Prometrium

I do not experience any sleepyness or grogginess in morning.  I have to take this because it offsets the effects of Estrogen gel.,F,49,1  months100 mg 1X D,9/3/2011,Prometrium
51, 3, prolonged bleeding during cycle,Day 1. Was told that it would make me sleepy. WOW. I felt completely drunk. Wondering if this is normal for dosage. There is no way I could take this other than at bedtime. So far no other symptoms.,,F,34,12  days400 mg 1X D,8/31/2011,Prometrium
52, 3, Stop frequent menstruation,Gained 17 lbs in a month_ severe depression_ major bloat_ Knocked me out within 30 minutes of taking it.  Stronger than other sleeping pills.,"I had almost constant periods for about 5 months and was feeling very fatigued from the  loss of blood.  Prometrium stopped the bleeding and kept me from having a period from May until October.  The only problem is I gained so much weight while on it and I was horribly depressed.  I ran into an ex boyfriend recently and he asked me how I was and if I still had to take ""that hormone.""  He told me he had never seen me that sad or bloated and was happy to see me these days being so happy.",F,31,21  days 1X D,8/15/2011,Prometrium
53, 5, menopause,none,I am taking prometrium 100 mg orally at night.  I am also on the vivelle dot 0.05.  The mood swings have gone. I was a loaded gun.  My symptoms with irritability and emotional lability at a #10. All gone now.   the severe hot flashes are gone. (I think that is the patch and not the Prometrium that took the hot flashes away???)  The wakening at night from the hot flashes is gone.  The vaginal dryness and dry skin are not.  Lots of lubs on the market though.  The one thing that continues is the awakening at night.  I also have difficulty falling asleep immediately now it takes up to one hour to fall asleep.  stopped all caffeine for 30 days and the problems with sleep still continue.  My libido has improved 300%. .  Laurel,F,60,1  years 1X D,8/10/2011,Prometrium
54, 3, Kick start my cycle.,Bloating_ weight gain_ cramping,I've missed 5 cycles since going off the pill so the doctor put me on to see if it would kick start me back into normal.  I've been on it for 5 days now and am BLOATED and putting on weight although I'm hopeful it will go away once I get off.  It does make me sleep better at night though.  It doesn't seem to be working for the cycle but the doctor has indicated that I am peri-menopausal so that would be why.,F,45,5  days2 x 200 mg 1X D,7/23/2011,Prometrium
55, 4, to induce period,Dizziness_ drowsiness_ bloating_ soreness of breasts(nipples)_ fatigue_ difficulty concentration_ anxiety_ mild cramps and tingling pain in lower-right abdomen and groin area_ gas.,Got period after 6th dose.I am ttc . I have PCOS and was on birth control until my laparascopy recently. I had the surgery to remove an ovarian cyst (and an ovary) and had two regular menstrual cycles afterwards. This time (3rd cycle) around I missed my period and showed negative on pregnancy_ so the doc prescribed prometrium to bring on my period. I took the pill by mouth.,M,29,10  days200 mg 1X D,7/21/2011Email,Prometrium
56, 3, perimenopausal symptoms,Used alone I'm not certain of any side affects as I take prometrium with premarin (1x daily).  When I take the two together (the last 10 days of the month) I have heavy_ extended periods 0f 9-11 days_and i feel the usual tired_ spacey_ chocolate cravings asociated with having a period.  But I also get some dizziness_ and brain fog.,I just discovered this site and I found out why I get dizzy and sleepy_ my OB-GYN neglected to tell me to take this medication AT NIGHT! makes sense as I was having trouble sleeping and night sweats.  I take a over-the counter sleep med_ but I will try Prometrium at night to see if it works. I will ask my Dr. to lower my dosage as  it may shorten the duration and strength of the periods i'm having. Thanks so much for your comments I don't feel alone anymore!!!!,F,55,90  days200 10X M,7/20/2011Email,Prometrium
57, 2, perimenopausal,nightmares,I'm taking prometrium since I'm  on an estradiol patch (the vivelle dot). No matter the dose or duration I am finding the prometrium intolerable because of the consistent_ horrible nightmares - I can tolerate the other side effects.  Is anyone else having this experience?  It is clearly related to the prometrium because I have been trying it off and on for over 6 months now.  I am at a loss as to what else to do to prevent uterine cancer and the estadiol has been a life saver for depressive symptom.,F,55,14  days100--200mg 1X D,7/13/2011Email,Prometrium
58, 4, missed period,dizzy_ cramping_ slight nausea_ racing heart_ odd dreams,I only took the meds for a little over half the prescribed time as I felt as though I had a ball in my belly. Way BLOATED! I gained a few pounds (water weight) and was very cranky and emotional. I started spotting the day I started taking it_ and did so until I stopped. The day I stopped I started bleeding like I was dying. I have never had cramps like these that didnt result in child-birth. and I'm bleeding through a super-plus maxi every hour_ I switched from tampons as the super-plus tampons were ineffective after a half-hour. considering calling the doctor. If you can stand the violent period_ I would say go for it. It works_ it just hurts and is rather inconvenient.,F,30,6  days200 2X D,7/3/2011,Prometrium
59, 2, no period; start ovulation cycle,Did not do anything.  Took 200 mg each day and was supposed to get my period at the end but I did not.  Nothing happened.  Did not have many side effects_ either.,Was very expensive in addition to not working!  Still have not gotten my period or ovulated.,F,29,12  days200 mg 1X D,6/29/2011Email,Prometrium
