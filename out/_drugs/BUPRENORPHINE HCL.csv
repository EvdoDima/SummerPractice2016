0, 5, chronic knee pain,none,I love this stuff.  It beats narcotics.  Things I've learned about it; 1) it can come in troche form which is a lot less than suboxone (with an anti-inflamatory added which makes it for a unique use). 2) docs are limited in the number of addiction recovery patients they may have but not in the number of pain management patients. 3) unlike traditional narcotics_ this works continually with no lessening of pain relief.,M,50,2  years8mg 2X D,7/24/2012Email,Buprenorphine hcl
1, 5, Back Pain_ Severe,Terrific pain killer. The only side effect for me was insomnia. Being a partial opiate agonist and partial antagonist it is a safer medication than pure agonist opioids. Used extensively in Europe_ but here in the USA any doctor wanting to prescribe this medication must take an 8 day course and give it only to addicts.,Use it in the USA for pain. It works great.,M,68,150  days,1/16/2009,Buprenorphine hcl

3, 4, Opiate withdrawl and cravings,None actually that i noticed,You cannot use any other opiates_ from codiene to oxy to heroin for 24-48 after taking bubrenorphine. Buprenoprphine is a partial opiate_ but does not make one high_ but totally eliminates withdrawls. ,M,31, ,5/22/2004Email,Buprenorphine hcl
