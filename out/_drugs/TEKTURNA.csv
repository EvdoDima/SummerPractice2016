3, 5, HBP,I did not have any side effects with Tekturna HTC.  The only complaint that I have is the price.  I was laid off from my job and had to switch to Losartan because of cost.  It was then that I began to experience problems (i.e._ weight gain_ fatigue).  I am switching back to Tekturna despite the cost.  It's just not worth it to be miserable.,,F,45,3  years 1X D,8/11/2013Email,Tekturna
4, 1, High BP,Severe urinary track infection_ enlarged boggy prostate an urethritis. Went through every test know to man for UTI including very painful scopes of the bladder an biopsy of the prostate. Was put on several different antibiotics for UTI even though no bacteria was ever found in clutters or urine. Read someone else experienced the same type problems with a 300 mg does of Tekturna but when dosage was decreased symptoms decreased same here.

I stopped taking it yesterday and I have immediately felt better.

I've been taking my BP and while it is elevated_ it's only slightly higher than when I was taking the Tekturna.  Now that I feel so fantastic_ I definitely don't want to go back on it.

11, 2, High blood pressure,Hair loss_ severe cough,I took Tekturna  for approx four years before I had to stop due to severe coughing (so bad that I broke a blood vessel in an eye). Prior to that_ I experienced substantial hair loss_ which started about 6 months into the treatment. But Tekturna worked fairly well. I was sorry I had to stop using it_ but the constant and severe cough was unbearable.,F,64,4  years300 mg 1X D,6/6/2012Email,Tekturna

14, 5, Hypertension,None,In 2007 my BP was 240/120_ and was also diagnosed with a bundle block.  I had a pacemaker implanted and cardiologist put me on Micardis/Hct and later added Norvasc.  My BP would never get lower than 140/100.  He then put me on 150 mg of Tekturna and within a month I was down to around 110/70.  I have maintained that for almost 3 yrs but yesterday my PCP called and told me to quit taking it because of some recent warnings.  I asked what the warning was about and was told there were instances of sudden cardiac arrest.  Great!  This medication worked for me and now I'm told to quit taking it.  To add to the frustration I have had to change my Plan D carrier twice because the ones I had dropped it from their formulary.  Now I've been put on Bystolic and I'm worried because of the complaints I've been reading about it.,M,68,3  years150 mg 1X D,1/10/2012Email,Tekturna

I found that it takes over the 2 weeks noted in the literature to really help.

17, 1, I had slightly elevated B/P,I had the worst back pain you could imagine. I ended up first in urgent care and then in the emergency room. I could only get to sleep with help from percocet and could only get through my day with a muscle relaxer. I had all over joint and muscle pain. I thought I had fibromyalgia.,Once I realized it was the Tekturna I called the doctor and discontinued the medication. Within one week the back pain was gone. The muscle and joint pain was gone. However_ I now have residual neurogenic pain in the last area of my upper back that was affected by Tekturna.,F,52,3  months 1X D,7/29/2011Email,Tekturna
18, 1, blood pressure,This has got to be one of the worst medicines that I have ever encountered! It made my joints ache_ I felt like I had been posioned-my stomache felt like a was going to throw up all of the time_ it put so much pressure on top of my head that I thought it would expode_ no sleep at all_ thank god my doctor changed my prescription. It did keep my blood pressure in check_ but created so many other problems_ never take that again!,,F,66,35  days150mg 1X D,7/6/2011Email,Tekturna
19, 1, HBP,At first_ I did not suspect this med. I thought I'd gotten an upper resp infection. My cough started slowly_ like when you have bronchitis and quickly worsened. I was so busy at work_ I was trying to push through it. Went to doc to see about what I thought was bronchitis_ and found that my blood pressure_ which had been somewhat high (150/80) was now 290/212. I was admitted to the hospital_ for what was expected to be an overnight stay_ turned into 11 days. Tekturna caused immediate CHF and a myriad of other issues. My blood pressure has not been controlled since_ but not as severe as when on this med. Because of this incident_ I am now uninsurable_ lost my health insurance and have more problems than ever - not to mention huge medical bills I'm still paying off. I would NEVER take this med_ or any other in this class again.,Agreed - the clinical studies on this were extremely skewed. I am so sorry I ever tried this med. For 25 years Zestoretic did a very reasonable job with many fewer side effects.,F,58,15  days150 mg 1X D,6/26/2011Email,Tekturna
20, 4, high blood pressure,bp rose very high initially at night_ but I felt energetic in the day. Doc changed to HCT formula. It still didn't work to lower bp_ but I loved how I felt. Diovan added..mostly works now. I take 150 in morning and again in early afternoon (not at night_ cant sleep). I must diet (Atkins) or I would gain weight rapidly. All worth it to me to feel good and not so tired.,,F,69,5  months150 mg 2X D,4/29/2011Email,Tekturna
21, 1, High Blood Pressure,Moderate difficulty breathing; dizziness & light headed; rise in BP & pulse rate over 10 days from 122/70  to 167/82; dry cough;,"I took for 10 days and my BP went up a little each day and developed the side effects mentioned to the left. Called Doctor and he told me to stop taking tekturna_ and go back on Verapamil ( which caused MAJOR palpitations - so I'll be med free until he figures out what to give me next).It seems Tekturna doesn't lower BP for a lot of people from what I read in this site. The Novartis (maker) website barely touches on this side effect in their clinical trials_ saying only that ...2.2% of patients were removed from tekturna for ""uncontrolled hypertension. 2.2% of 6_450 patients in the trial = 142 people.What good is a BP med if it RAISES your BP?Want to see the shocking truth about how patients are chosen for ""clinical trials?""  GOOGLE  Clinical Trial_ and read the WikiPedia article. Women_ children_ the elderly_ and those with common medical conditions are frequently excluded from trials. That is to prevent those people from having adverse effects to skew the results of the drugs during trials so the FDA will approve them. Yet the drug will be prescribed to those same women_ children_ the elderly_ etc at some point_ and they will experience bad reactions to the drugs_ reactions that would have been discovered in trials.

22, 1, HBP,By the 5th day began having severe and constant arrythmias_ to the point that ER trip was needed.  Had been taking Cozaar (Losartan) also_ so perhaps the two combined contributed. (?) No heart problems were discovered_ so it appeared that the only variable was the initiation of Tekturna.  Wonder if anyone has had this problem_ because journal evidence does not list arrythmias as a possible side-effect.,Wonder if anyone has had this problem_ because journal evidence does not list arrythmias as a possible side-effect.,F,63,5  days150 mg 1X D,9/1/2010,Tekturna

29, 5, High Blood Pressure,Have had high BP for about a year. Almost every BP med I tried has had bad side effects EXCEPT Tekturna. I am taking 150 mg. Tekturna twice a day plus 100 mg Metoprolol twice a day. Began a year ago with BP at 212(!). Now in the 130's. New drug... your insurance may not cover any/all of the cost. Great stuff...give it a whirl if you've had problems with other BP meds.,,M,62,2  months,1/16/2010,Tekturna
30, 4, High bp,Tried Diovan_ Benicar (cough with those) but Tekturna has least side effects. Worst side effect for me is weight gain. 10lbs in 5 months @ 300mg. On about 500 calories a day and cannot drop weight. Tinitus. Achy muscles(neck and lower back)every so often. It has affected my personality_ not as much enthusiasm and drive which is very dissappointing.,It has controlled my bp so far.,F,64,5  months,12/26/2009,Tekturna
31, 4, HBP,I have tried  every BP medicine and could not tolerate any of them. Tekturna (150mg) works for me_ but I do have some side effects that are very bothersome. I have serious insomnia_ and my heart beats rapidly_ as high as 95-109 beats per minute. My Dr put me on Inderal to lower my pulse_ but the insomnia persists.,Also started getting short of breath and cut my pill in half. It remedied this. My Dr explained that this medicine builds up in your system_ and if you quit taking Tekturna_ it would still lower blood pressure for 2 weeks.,F,56,8  months,10/1/2009,Tekturna
32, 5, hypertension,I tried eleven (11) other medications before trying Tekturna and was either allergic or had horrible adverse reactions_ and my blood pressure would not get lower.

35, 3, High BP,Only on Tekturna for 2 weeks and so far it's worked great_ with no side effects.  Literature says diarrhea is the most common but I've had none.,Also read that it works much better with Diovan combined. So far it's working well by itself 135/70 but since I was on Diolvan alone before(which did 'not' keep my BP stable it was erratic but no side effects) I'll keep that in mind and if the BP does shoot back up I'll add the Diovan back with the Tekturna. I liked the way it worked directly on the Renin_ differently than the ARBs or ACE inhibitors or esp. the Beta blockers.  Fingers crossed.,F,55,2  weeks,4/10/2009,Tekturna
36, 3, High Blood Pressure,No side effects noticed_ except for maybe making my bp go higher.  Worked great (150mg) .. for about 2 months.  Doctor said if bp starts to creep up_ then to double the dose.  I moved to 300mg for a few days_ which made me feel even worse_ and my bp went up even higher.  I read that the renin rebound is higher with these types of drugs when compared with the ACEs and ARBs.  Was then given 5mg lisinopril (dad's been on this one @20mg with success for 10+ years) to add to the 150mg tekturna_ which worked_ but too good.  I started consistently getting 100/60 readings with heart rate high 70's in the evening_ and my body just didn't feel right during those times.  After a month and a half of that_ I went to tekturna 150mg and lisinopril 2.5mg.  In less than a week_ bp was up and I felt like crap.  Switched back to 150mg/5mg for a little over a week_ which brought things down again_ but like before.  I then switched to tekturna 75mg and lisinopril 5mg_ which brought me energetically and bp,I do yoga once a week and practice a martial art twice a week.  If I open up and share that I battle high blood pressure_ people are shocked.  I will say_ during the times when taking this drug and when the bp has been under control_ my sexual responsiveness was improved.  With that said_ to all that are looking for the right bp drug for them_ I say this one's worth a shot.,M,33,6  months,2/11/2009,Tekturna

38, 1, HI Blood Pressure,After 2 weeks did not control BP. and made my puls race switched back to DIOVAN.  About that time I found some info ON LOWERING BP. W/ HI POTASSIUM DIET. BEEN EATING MASHED POTATOES (7 OZ.) = 1000 MG. POTASSIUM.  ALSO MORE VEGGIES & FRUIT. PLANTAINS ALSO ARE HI IN POTASSIUM.  USE A SALT SUBSTITUTE WHICH IS POTASSIUM 600MG/ 1/4TSP. IF I EAT SODIUM I TRY TO EQUAL W/POTASSIUM.  LAST 2 WEEKS DOING THIS I TAKE 1/2 (80MG) DIOVAN /DAY AND BP. STAYS AROUND 125/75.  TOOK ABOUT 8-9DAYS FOR DIET TO START WORKING.  I BELIEVE IN TIME I WILL BE DOWN TO 1/4 DIOVAN OR LESS/DAY.

I also take HCTZ 25mg and 10mg amlodipine. The aliskerin was substituted for good old lisinopril 20 mg. and I think the lisinopril worked better.
