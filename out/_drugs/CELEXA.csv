4, 5, GAD and Depression,A follow up.......This is a fantastic drug. I was started on 10 mg and went through the normal side effects which left after 3 to 4 weeks. My doctor boosted my dosage to 20 mg. Too much. Too medicated. Went back to 10 mg and will hold with this dose. I feel fantastic. I'm a senior and the FDA has now stated that 20 mg is the highest dose a person over the age of 60 should be prescribed. More mgs. may not help but hurt.,Great for senior citizens at 10 mg at least for me. Anything stronger is too much.,M,68,4  months10MG 1X D,6/10/2016Email,Celexa

7, 5, GAD & Depression,Nausea_ Insomnia_ Lack of Appetite_ Restlessness_ Fatigue and Yawning,"Through the years I've suffered from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and seemed to handle it on my own through diet_ exercise and my spiritual faith. This cursed condition runs in the family. When the anxiety really got too much the doctor prescribed Xanax to use as needed when it got too much to handle. I'm a retired senior citizen and this winter really got to me. I was stricken with the most horrible and wicked bout of anxiety which led to a bout of depression which I really never experienced before. All of this stuff was brought on by some ongoing unresolved family issues which kept building up and I guess I had a massive meltdown. It seemed like my world was ending before my eyes. I was really lost. I have a wonderful family physician and she prescribed this miracle drug to me. She said many of her patients had great success with it. I was warned that the first 2 weeks were not pleasant at all but I knew I had to just ""suck it up"" to let this med work to heal me.  By the end of the 3rd week I really began to see light at the end of the tunnel. A new calm and peace I've never experienced in all of my years. I am now entering my 5th week and I really feel a new sense of normal that is totally new to me...  Whoever may be trying this for the 1st time....please don't give up.

14, 1, Depression during pregnacy,psychosis_ suicidal_ doing things and then not remembering doing them_ weight gain?,This is on behalf of my friend. She is pregnant and her depression got worse and she was prescribed Celexa. She's been having horrifying side effects. Apparently she sees things and then doesn't remember_ has tried to hang herself then doesn't remember_ says weird things and doesn't remember... everyone tells her she's done this stuff but she swears she can't remember. She's also put on a decent amount of weight_ more than pregnancy weight. Not just her stomach and hips (typical pregnancy weight) but everywhere... and I'm thinking Celexa might be the culprit since it can cause weight gain. She's naturally very tiny so this is a bit odd. She's been very self conscious because of this weight gain. I'm not sure why her doctor put her on this medication but he/she is an idiot.,F,21,1  months 1X D,12/29/2015,Celexa

22, 5, Major Depression,I found that stopping Celexa was worse than starting. Some of this might have been because I was so depressed and that the side effects were tolerable in the beginning. However_ when I stopped taking Celexa I felt really nauseous for over a month straight and have been having weird electric shock sensations. I think my body must be more sensitive because I had taken over three months to wean off under the supervision of my doctor and still had some bad side effects when stopping. Despite this_ I would defiantly consider taking Celexa again if I need to.,I was in the depths of major depression and wanted to kill myself. I have never been so sad and did not see any hope. After talking with my doctor she recommended Celexa. I was hesatant to start taking an antidepressant because I thought it would be a life long thing but she told me that I could take the medication for the short term like 6 to 8 months to see if it would help. It did take some time to kick in but after about two months I was back to my old self and smiling. For me Celexa was a great tool that_ along with counseling and lifestyle changes_ helped me to live again. I am so glad I got help and did not give up.,F,31,8  months20 MG 1X D,7/16/2015,Celexa

I'm pretty much just in the 'whatever'... mood most of the day. ha. It did make my period late_ as I have read about others also. Don't be scared to take this med.

24, 5, Depression,None,Celexa has been very helpful treating my depression. However if I miss a dose or a few doses I will cry uncontrollably about anything and everything. Very small things can set off a crying jag. Otherwise I've been very satisfied with the results of this medication. My dr did switch me to Viibryd because at one point I felt the celexa wasn't working and that pushed me over the edge.

27, 3, Depression,I ate more than I usually did and gain some weight.  Also_ the first few weeks_ i started taking naps because i got drowsy.,I took for it for 3 months and i saw some change.  I felt slightly less negative  about life but I was still having days were i was too depressed to get out of bed.  I was told I would have to wait a month for the effects to happen but 3 months passed and nothing happened.

28, 3, Bipolar,Extreme sleepiness_ Lethargy_ Sluggishness,I have bipolar_ manic only type but my docs all insist I take an anti-depressant too_ they say it will help with anxiety and help tame my manic episodes. Ah_ha_ha...no. For bipolar mania it's about as ineffective as a placebo_ it may help for depression but I wouldn't know because I don't have depression. It didn't ease my anxiety at all. What it did do was make me sleep non-stop. I would literally sleep for 19 hours_ up for 5_ back to sleep for 6 hours_ up for 3_ then back to bed that night for 17 hours. When I was awake I was so tired and sluggish all I could think about was I can't wait to go back to sleep. I would sleep right thru my alarm_ started paying my bills late and missing my appointments because I could not wake up. My last doc put me back on it for IBS but I made him lower my dose to only 20mg which is tolerable. It works very well for irritable bowels and constipation but I had to stop taking it because my new ADHD med if taken with Celexa can cause my heart to stop or explode. So now my Adhd is under control but going to the bathroom is painful again.,F,29,2  months100mg 3X D,5/6/2015,Celexa

30, 1, anxiety/stress,While I did experience a relieving overall calm_ the bad outweighed the good. 30lb weight gain (I'm a distance runner). Extremely lethargic (I started sleeping whenever I had free time). Antisocial (I love a party). Unmotivated (chose sleep over daily runs). Chewing on the inside of my cheeks while asleep (never did this before). Stopped for a week. Lost 3lbs_ but became uncontrollably irritable.

31, 4, Depression/Anxiety,I was initially prescribed this med for postpartum depression after my last baby. I can honestly say that I think this medication helped me tremendously. As with any antidepressant_ I was worried about weight gain_ but I did not have a problem losing weight (at least initially) while I was on it. When I did start gaining weight after being on it for about 5 years_ my doctor tried blaming the medication and switched me to wellbutrin (which I hated). I have since realized that the weight I have gained was due to a different health issue and had nothing to do with the Celexa. Although I am trying to refrain from taking any antidepressants_ in the future if I ever do need one again_ this will be the one I go for.,Worked great for treating depression and anxiety and I personally had no bad side effects whatsoever.,F,37,5  years20mg 1X D,4/9/2015Email,Celexa
32, 4, Anxiety,I did not experience many side effects that I can attribute to Celexa. The only one I had_ and the reason I quit_ was erectile dysfunction. Ruined my confidence_ and made me concerned that something else was causing it.,Celexa worked great for me and my anxiety.

37, 3, Anxiety,At first_ like any antidepressant_ it was hard to adjust.  It make me a little nauseous_ sleeping was effected_ no weight gain at all_ worked for anxiety_ if I took too much I couldn't orgasm.  But I am on such a low dose that its not working enough for what I need it to but I dont want to lose sex drive and now after all this time on it I am having memory issues and feeling like I just can't think_ like I am straining my brain.  I want to try something else.  If you're not worried about your sex drive_ take it bc it works.  Now Lexapro didnt effect my sex drive at all but it made me gain weight and I was tired ALL the time.  So I am going to try a new med called Fetzima.  I am hopeful.,,F,43,2  years10 1X D,1/6/2015,Celexa

Even after 2 years off I was with bad sensations (no feelings at all_ no sensations of love_ anger_ etc.) that this medicine brought to me..

42, 1, Depressed,Celexa ruined my life_ started out on 20 mg_ I told the doctor after a few months of taking it that something just wasn't right and doctor said that not to worry that I just need a increase in dose to 40mg_ at the time I was depressed as I was dealing with renal cell cancer and lost a kidney_ Celexa changed me_ it wasn't helping the depression it was making me depressed more and I went away and forgot to take my Celexa with me and that was the best thing that could have ever happened after a little over a week I started to see that this medicine changed me_ changed my personality_ mood swings and I realized that people with depression don't know why they are depressed_ I was depressed because I had a reason.

43, 1, MDD & GAD,Increased suicidal and other intrusive thoughts. Racing thoughts. Hyperactivity. Increased paranoia. Increased impulsivity. Decreased sex drive. Decreased appetite. Weight gain (20-30 lbs). Marked unusual changes in personality_ behavior_ and mood. Emotional numbness and inappropriate expression of emotions (especially smiling and laughter).,My experience is too long to detail here but suffice to say my experience on this medication was absolutely horrifying and left me extremely apprehensive about trying medication again. This was my first time giving medication a try after suffering for eighteen years without and it was the only medication I was taking at the time. I did not drink or participate in the use of recreational drugs at all whilst I was on this medication. I called it quits after all of the wretched side effects finally accumulated into one of the worst panic attacks I've ever experienced in my entire life_ which resulted in me missing one appointment with my doctor and lead to her refusing to see/treat me anymore. My condition was worse than ever before for over a year afterwards_ I suffered several very severe depressive episodes and my anxiety disorder developed into agoraphobia. I had one friend who was also taking this medication at the time and had been for a few years_ at a much higher dosage than me_ who had expressed never having experienced any problems with it at all... however she was also on several other medications simultaneously. Another friend also opened up about taking this medication later on_ same dosage_ and expressed that she also had serious problems while she was on it and ended up quitting.,F,29,3  months20 1X D,11/26/2014,Celexa

45, 5, Anxiety PTSD,Initially I had the fatigue and feeling so sluggish but I cut the dose in 1/2 for two weeks. I only took 5 mgs before I went to sleep. After two weeks I increased it to the 10mgs and still I take it before I go to sleep. No other side effects at all.  No weight gain. In fact_ I've lost the pesky 10 pounds I was trying to lose and kept it off with no changes in diet or anything.,Celexa has been great. I have had no issues once I cut the dose in 1/2 and gave myself a few weeks to adjust. Now I take my full dose before I go to sleep. No problems at all. This has helped me level out so good. I'm less anxious and I notice I have a handle on the PTSD a bit better than before. Nothing is perfect but this helps with the majority of it all. Served as a RN in Iraq and Afghanistan and really had troubles when I returned home. This has helped me so much. I truly do feel better_ not 100 percent but much better than before and better than I felt in a very long time. I'm happy with this medicine.,F,38,3  months10 1X D,10/28/2014Email,Celexa
46, 5, C-PTSD and Anxiety disorder,No libido whatsoever,Helped so much; my miracle drug!  I spent about a 1.5 years on Zoloft for depression_ but started misusing it when anxiety came on. Finally had a complete anxiety meltdown that sent me to the ER.  The next day my doc took me off Zoloft and gave me Celexa.  It took a while for the anxiety to settle down_ but I felt hopeful for the first time.  My panic attacks went from constant_ to sometimes_ to now and then_ to hardly_ and now basically non-existent.  I still get a little edgy on rare occasions if I'm really stressed_ but no actual panic attacks in about a year.,F,,2.5  years20 MG 1X D,10/28/2014,Celexa
47, 1, Anxiety,I've tried many meds for anxiety & no luck except Prozac for 7 yrs then it pooped out so tried this. I am sensitive so Dr put me on 5mg after dinner. A little nausea at first but not bad. Then for the next 5 days I slept! I had extreme fatigue & drowsiness. Couldn't go anywhere but my bed_ bathroom & fix easy food items. I was a slug. I couldn't go to my yoga or water aerobics class. I basically lost s week sleeping. I didn't want to be around anyone. After existing for a week I told myself this is not normal & I am having a bad reaction because this is dangerous unhealthy drowsiness. I took 2.5mg the next night & stopped. It's been 48 hrs since last dose & can keep my eyes open & can read my book again. There is no getting past that kind of reaction. I had no anxiety of course because it knocked me out. I'm feeling better now. Be careful with this stuff. No wonder people gain weight you become so inactive. No pills for me. Glad some have good results but I read a lot that people just keep taking it hoping side effects will lessen & are quite miserable. Strangest medication I've ever taken & scarey. Good luck trust your gut.,,F,62,7  days5mg,10/23/2014,Celexa

I have been on it about four or five seperate occasions. The first couple of times I tried generic but proper brand name Celexa/Cipramil (I am Australian) works much better and in Oz only costs a few dollars more. Don't fall for the generic trap! I have experimented with other SSRI's and SNRI's and even an NRI at psychiatrist's requests but now insist on this one if I need to go back on!

Regret that- it REALLY has helped.  At first dry mouth_ thirsty_ and a tiny bit dizzy.  A couple of nights of insomnia but I have something to offset that.  A major uptick in mood and overall energy.  Does not flatten me out as bad as the others have years ago where you felt nothing- no happiness_ no sadness- just blank.

Felt improvement after 2 weeks but felt a LOT better after one full month.  You have to stick with this and give it a chance. The worst SE's were the first week.  They have gone away or are greatly lessened and can be dealt with. Still some drowsiness at times.  I take this before bed at night. I feel like myself again and am back to doing and planning things.  Sleeping a lot better too. Tried all kinds of things (sleeping pills_ benzos) and this is the one that worked (and is much safer).,M,53,1  months20 1X D,4/2/2014,Celexa
59, 4, bulimia and depression,Extremely tired (still) and diarrhea_ nausea and migraines first 4-5 days. Diarrhea and nausea subsided after about 3 days and headaches for about 5. I'm still extremely tired_ it may even be getting worse. I can literally sleep all day and I could never sleep in the daytime before_ not even when I was sick.,I was purging 1-2 times per day for 15 years. Literally_ I have only thrown up 1 time in the past 9 days and the normal urge wasn't as intense for that. I could have easily not done it. This so far has been like a miracle drug for my bulimia. I used to get so stressed out and have anxiety and that triggered my purging..but now I don't get stressed and my mind is so much clearer...and I'm never hungry. So_ when I eat I am almost making myself eat and there is no need to overeat. I'm sorry I waited so many years to try this but I really didn't want to get on any medications. If you have bulimia and need some help fighting it_ I highly recommend trying this. It will make you extra tired. That is the one downfall but I'd rather be tired and keeping my body healthy.,F,38,9  days20 1X D,3/24/2014Email,Celexa
