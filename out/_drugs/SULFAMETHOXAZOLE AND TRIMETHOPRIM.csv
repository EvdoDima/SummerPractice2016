0, 1, Severe Diarrhea,anxiety_ insomnia and heart palpitations,I took this drug for 1 day_ once in the am and once in the pm_ and by that night I started feeling anxious so I decided to stop taking this med. Today is starting my third day off of this stuff and the anxiety has gotten worse or its just me stressing out or not sleeping at all last night. I am really starting to wonder how long this stuff is going to stick with me. If there is anyone out there who has overcome these side effects please share your story on this site as I have read through several hundreds of reviews and have not seen any clear answers as to anyone recovering. I just feel like I'm in a pit right now and I just want some good news. So please someone just email me so at least I'm not alone in this,M,27,1  days800/160 2X D,2/11/2016Email,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
1, 1, Urinary tract infection,Took 1 pill right after supper with 8 oz water and had no real side effects.  Then 3 hours later as I got into bed I experienced sudden onset of severe dizziness immediately upon lying down for the night_ nausea from room spinning around and sudden extreme sweating so that I had to rip off all my night clothes.  I felt like I was going to die. Managed to sit up on side of bed and within 10 minutes all the horrible reactions were totally gone.  Took no more pills.,I had taken this medication on two earlier occasions for UTI bouts with only slight tummy indigestion.  Pills worked well at that time.,F,79,1  times 2X D,1/24/2014,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim

3, 1, UTI,Severe muscle aches behind my thighs_ knees_ calves_ and arms. Swelling to the face and lips. Flushed skin. Persistent numbness in my fingers. Extreme sharp headaches. High fever of a 102. Swollen face and lips. Dizziness. Inability to stand for more than 5 seconds. Liquid discharge from the eyes. Chills and overall body aches.,I took this medication for my UTI just before dinner within 5 hours I developed a very high fever_ chills and muscle aches. I had sharp headaches that felt like a knife that attacked in the same spot behind and front side of my head. I began to take extra strength Tylenol every two hours for the fever and headaches. This helped keep the fever down but not the headaches. As soon as the three hour mark hit the fever would shoot up. Thinking it was just the flu I went to work in the morning. I did not take the second dose because I was under some other medications for other reasons and did not want to take them closely together_ so I intended to space them apart by 2 hours. When I woke up my face and lips were swollen and my skin was flushed. By 9 a.m. I began getting a strong pain behind my legs to the point I had to keep them moving in order to stay standing. It increasingly got worse that even if I moved I still felt like my legs would give out and I would fall. By 11:30 a.m. I had to go back to the clinic. I was in extreme pain_ my fever and headaches continued and I had an overall terrible feeling that something was very wrong. I tried to describe my pain to the doctor that I had never felt these types of pain in my legs before so she ordered an ultrasound to my legs. But found nothing. The doctor consulted an allergist and another doctor and gave them a list of my medications. They all concurred that my symptoms sounded like it was due to the sulfameth+trimeth.

4, 2, sore throat/congestion,Fever around 102_ chills_ rash that spread starting on face and neck_ back_ and chest and spread to all my body.  This happened afte taking the drug for 4 days.  It was prescribed for 10 days,I  didn't know to look for this to be an allergic reaction to the medicine I was taking. I just thought the medicine wasn't the right one I needed_ because my son had had strep throat the week before_ and I thought perhaps the strep infection may have come to me after I had been taking the medicine.Since it took several days to have any symptoms I didn't connect the 2.,F,50,4  days,1/19/2008,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
5, 3, staph infection in foot,I took a 10 day course and by about the 6th day into it_ was experiencing abdominal pain and general abdominal tenderness. Also loss of appetite and moderate fatigue. I am an athlete and found that any high impact sports such as running increased my symptoms significantly. I also often felt headachy and mildly nauseous. I tend to be sensitive to antibiotics and this one proved to be no different for me. It did however significantly clear up the infection in my foot within 24 hours.,,F,39,10  days,1/26/2007,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
6, 1, Infectious prostatitus,I got through one 10 day course with few problems.  But a few days later I had to start again.  Two hours after one pill I started to itch.  Within a few more hours my temperature was up to 101_ I had chills almost like convulsions_ and I vomited several times.  The next day my doctor put me on Benadryl and the symptoms cleared up.,,M,63, ,1/5/2007,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
