0, 3, Yeast,Vaginal pain,I had a stabbing vaginal pain and cramps.  My doctor thinks I may be allergic_ but sometimes pain is a symptom of yeast_ so who knows.  The first day I used it_ I swear it was like a miracle drug.  After the second dose the pain started_ so my doctor said no more.  The pain is starting to subside_ so I think it was the Terazol 3.  It also gave me chills and a general feeling of malaise.  It got rid of the yeast though!,F,40,2  days,1/8/2010,Terazol 3
1, 5, To prevent yeast infection,None,My Dr. had me use this a follow up while treating cervicitis/BV with cleocin (I did 2 rounds of the treatment).  It can often cause yeast infections so this was used as a preventitive measure.  He also did not recommend any of the OTC type of monistat products and thinks they are highly ineffective in treating yeast infections. Go to your Dr._ get a proper diagnosis and treat with prescription products.  Diflucan is also a very good drug for yeast infections.,F,33,6  days,2/5/2008,Terazol 3
2, 5, yeast infection,no side effects,Im not sure if it went away. But i had no burn_ no itch! I think this stuff is great!!! I personally think it is way better than Monastat_ which totally burns and itches.,F,28,3  days,9/14/2007,Terazol 3
3, 3, vaginal yeast infection,my vagina still itched the entire time I used this medicine_ and still itches though I am on the last day of using it. I noticed the longer I went without using it_ the more the itch would subside so maybe the medicine itself makes you itchy down there. I really hope the yeast infection goes away.,,M,24,3  days,2/11/2007,Terazol 3
4, 5, ,works great!,monistat tore me apart... terazol is way better.,F,25, ,8/13/2006,Terazol 3
