0, 1, Parkinsons Disease,After taking this drug for 8 months_ my mother has gone from having a few memory issues and slight impulsive behaviour to suddenly (in the last 2 weeks) now having full blown paranoia in which she thinks my father is trying to make her think she is mad (she cannot find things and then blames him for moving them when it is later found)_  now spends hours in her dresser room moving / sorting out the same items & clothes (Impulsive compulsive behaviour)and trusts no one with has lead to some very deceptive behaviour. She now wants to control her own money with seperate bank accounts and wants to move out and leave her 38 year marriage.,The consultants are now trying to lower the dosage of this drug and my mother is on weekly home visits to moniter her state of her mind but I suspect the damage has already been done. My father had no idea how bad my mothers paranoia had got until I (the daughter) stayed with them for a week (I live in another country). The nurse consultant had no idea either as my mother did not tell her the extent of her suspicions until we went to an appointment all together (a week after her previous meeting) and she revealed to the nurse her real thoughts and emotions.  Whilst my mother is adament this drug is working (the shaking hand has stopped)_ the side effects are just not worth it.  If you already have any minor jealousy issues / minor impulsive compulsive  behaviour_ then I would seriously consider NOT using this drug as I suspect this drug enhances this behaviour.,F,67,8  months12 mg 1X D,3/19/2012Email,Requip xl
