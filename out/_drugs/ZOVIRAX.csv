0, 1, shingles,Insomnia_ nausea_ vomiting_ severe brain fog_ loss of appetite,I'm in college and I couldn't think to do my work. It was unlike anything I've ever experienced and very scary.,M,22,2  days 3X D,5/7/2012Email,Zovirax
1, 5, Cold Sores on Mouth,None,My instructions say to take 4 a day for 8 days. I've found that if you take a pill as soon as you feel the mild tingle (no visual bump yet) then the cold sore will usually go away after 5 pills ( 1 day ) and it won't even appear. But you got to be quick and you may likeley take some pills for false a indication sometimes but early treatment is the key. When in doubt take the pills_ once you see the sores its too late.,M,45,15  years200 MG 4X D,5/29/2010,Zovirax
2, 5, Angiodema related to Epstein Barr,Knocked out the lip burning and swelling within first 24 hours.  Have been symptom free since finishing 10 day dose.  Usually have attack once or twice a year.  Used to take Prednisone but this is better and safer.  Slight headach while taking medication but no other side effects at all.  Just normal feeling lips for first time in months.  I also have Interstial Cystitis and it calmed it down as well.,,F,44,10  days,12/10/2007,Zovirax
3, 5, Cold Sores,none,I can't believe how great this drug works!  As a sufferer of cold sores my whole life_ I've tried A LOT of things.  Many don't work and are a waste of money.  I have found that if you take Zovirax as soon as you feel the tingle of a cold sore emerging_ it will stop the progression and save you a lot of pain and embarrasment.  The key is getting the med in you right away.  I have my doctor write me refills so I always have the drug on hand - particularly when I travel or am in a stressful season of life and likely to get a cold sore.,F,39, ,8/16/2007,Zovirax
4, 3, Shingles,overgrowth of bacteria in intestines and colon - causing abdominal pain_ gas_ diarhea,,M,50,3  months,8/14/2007,Zovirax
5, 4, shingles in my 10 yr old,nausea and fatigue,My son was put on acyclovir for shingles. He is 10 years old.  I was concerned becuase of the serious side effects I read about.  The medicince worked well_ though.  His only side effect was on day two_ I think when he tollk his second dose and the medicine had really hit his system good_ he got stomach cramps with nausea and he was really tired/worn out like he just didnt want to get up and do anything.  It did wear off later that day_ however.  His rash from the shingles dried up and the medicine did its job.,M,10,10  days,4/13/2007,Zovirax

7, 2, Shingles,Nausea_ Diaharrea_ vomiting,Worked against shingles_ but expensive and side effects were miserable.,M,62,7  days,8/27/2005,Zovirax
8, 5, cold sores (herpes simplex),Light peeling of the skin on the lips.,Zovirax drastically reduces the symptoms I usually feel with the onset of an outbreak.  Sores are smaller_ do not erupt as much_ and disappear in 3-4 days.  Fever is avoided when treatment is initiated early.  Sore throat_ swollen lymph nodes_ congestion_ runny nose_ are all reduced significantly.  I have been using this for 5 years.  A round of treatment usually lasts a week.  I continue treatment 2 days past the last symptom_ with 6-10 applications per day.,M,38,5  years,2/21/2005,Zovirax

10, 3, Cold Sores on mouth,dry lips,It was fine--but I kept having to increase my dose to prevent/treat mouth sores.  Not worth taking an expensive medication for this problem.,F,31,4  years,5/4/2004,Zovirax
11, 1, Acne,Depression_ Anxiety_ OCD_ etc,Zovirax is a highly dangerous drug and should be resarched before engaging in taking it,M,48,9  months,3/21/2003,Zovirax
