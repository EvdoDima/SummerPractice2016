1, 2, Shingles,I've had a lung transplant and am immunosuppresed. I'm also in rejection with poor lung function. I got shingles and was prescribed this. I started to feel very weak. Have more difficulty breathing_ I felt like my blood pressure increased_ and like I couldn't catch my breath. Was tired all the time and had trouble just moving around. At first I thought my lungs were getting worse_ but when I stopped taking Acyclovir those symptoms cleared up. Doctors of course don't believe me_ but the symptoms were very real and return when I just take 1 dose.,I can't take this drug. I would rather go through the pain of shingles again. Not sure if I'm allergic or what_ but I don't see many people reporting what I feel_ so I wanted to share.,M,43,10  days400mg,7/23/2016Email,Acyclovir

7, 5, Eczema Herpeticum,I get stomach aches occasionally from it. Possibly from not drinking enough water.,Without this drug my face would be covered in blisters. I have been taking this medication with flare ups for 10 years. They happen frequently so luckily this medication is pretty inexpensive even without insurance. It was 4 or 5 dollars for a bottle at the Walmart pharmacy.,F,28,5  days400mg 3X D,4/1/2016,Acyclovir

12, 3, herpes simplex of lips and mouth,Only odd side effect is neon.green urine and stools,If my son did not take this medicine every day his lips and mouth would be a crusted oozing wound. This medicine is a god send that works most of the time if you catch the onset immediately. He uses liquid oral and the cream. It's very expensive and have to jump through hoops to get insurance to pay for it. Our insurance pays half because it's considered a specialty drug. We pay $550 a month. I wish it wasn't so expensive but well worth it and our family is blessed to be able to afford it but a huge hardship to a family that can't.,M,3,2  years800 mg liq,10/28/2015,Acyclovir

17, 3, shingles,At the time I did not seem to have any side effects but I did notice a rash/raised little red bumps on my face.   However since then I have been diagnosed with PMLE which is an allergy to sunlight. I can only assume that this reaction was triggered by taking this drug.  I have suffered with this now for 2years and means I have to be extremely careful when I go out in the sun. With hindsight although the drug probably prevented me suffering too badly with the shingles I seem to have developed a life long condition re allergy to the sun_  so wish I had never taken it,,F,59,7  days,8/14/2015,Acyclovir

I seemed to always get them on my kneecap and below the shaft of my penis which generally speaking hurt extremely bad! I would get swollen lymph nodes in my groin and feel extremley tired before an outbreak would occur. Acyclovir cleared a bad outbreak up in the matter of 3 days! Totally worth it if you ask me!,M,24,10  days400mg 5X D,7/4/2015Email,Acyclovir
23, 5, Genital hsv-1,No noticeable side effects,I was taking Valtrex for nearly six months at different dosages and it barely taking away any of my symptoms so finally I decided to go with a different medications and even through the first few days of taking this I can already tell that it is working much better than any other treatments I was recieving. With my constant unending breakouts and symptoms I thought that I would have to deal with this bull for the rest of my life_ but it seems that things are becoming better. Seriously good luck and if you're having any trouble have no fear in speaking to your doctor about it. I know I did_ but that's their job and if they don't like it dump them and find a new one. Good luck.,F,18,4  days3 daily,6/1/2015,Acyclovir

I had the most horrible head pressure and went to the hospital twice. Now I'm having tremors_ head pressure_ tingling all over my body_ facial spams. I'm so upset. I'm convinced that the lab that made the tablets mixed something wrong. I had no effect with the same drug in capsule form. This seems strange. Please be careful guys.

Note: I get them really bad just after a yeast infection. They cover inside and out of top_ right side of my lip. Also_ the lower right side (outside)_ lower left (outside)_ and entire bottom inside near the gum line. Never had a simple_ little_ one spot_ breakout. Lips and gums swell to the point of visits to the ER. Better results with this med than with valtrex.
