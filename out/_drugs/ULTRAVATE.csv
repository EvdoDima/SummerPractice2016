0, 4, Eczema,This stuff is one of the most powerful topical steroids and I ended up getting away from it because of dermatitic atrophy (thining of skin). I think short runs for flare ups are better than prolonged use as effectiveness_ for me_ tapered off and required longer and higher dosage prednisone courses.,It's like lightning: awesome but could be dangerous if not given careful consideration.,M,36,3  years 3X D,6/4/2010Email,Ultravate
1, 5, Psoriasis,Slight irritation when used over prolonged period.,Should not be used for longer than 2 weeks at a time. Works fine at reducing itching and plaqueing in psoriasis_ but psoriasis never really heals completely. Far better than most steroid creams_ however_ and much lighter and easier to use. Switched to Humira with amazing results.,M,38,4  years,7/15/2008Email,Ultravate
