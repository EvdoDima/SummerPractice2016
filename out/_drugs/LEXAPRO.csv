3, 2, Major Depressive Disorder,Decreased libido and emotional numbness,All antidepressants can affect libido_ but Lexapro killed the little bit of sex drive I had left.  The biggest issue_ though_ is that it's made me totally numb_ emotionally.  I don't feel sad_ but I don't feel anger_ empathy_ or love either.  I just feel empty.  I'm so done with this medicine.,F,37,2  months30mg 1X D,7/11/2016Email,Lexapro
4, 1, GAD,dizzy_ headache_ felt in a fog_ agitated_ nausea,My GAD hasn't been terrible over the years.  Overall I handled it without requiring drugs.  Infrequently took .25 alprazolam for tougher events.  Having a particularly rough year with many stressful events occurring at the same time.  Saw my doctor about this and the increased anxiety and he suggested I try Lexapro (alprazolam OK as needed).  So I haven't had such a difficult time with anxiety under normal circumstances over the years.  Felt so terrible with only two days of Lexapro (way worse than any anxiety I've felt) that I knew that it wasn't for me.  I stopped taking it and will try to manage without drugs.... step up exercise... try meditation/relaxation techniques.,F,63,2  days10 1X D,7/10/2016,Lexapro

It took a long time to figure out what was causing the horrible acid reflux that come on suddenly and cough_ but I'm convinced it's a side effect of the Lexapro. It's a great drug for short term?

17, 2, To treat depression,I had vivid dreams that I could not distinguish from realitity and memory. I had to use logic to come to understand that these dreams Did not happen. This is a side effect my therapist didn't even know was possible. It meant I wasted a lot of time looking for things that didn't exist. But the worse episode for me was when I had a dream that my younger brother had been dead for a decade. I was alone in my dorm room at the time and so it took me an hour to realize he was still alive.Also_ the medication only has an affect on my mood if I am taking caffine as well. This was an accidental discovery for me as I have worried I am caffine sensitive like both my parents are.,,,19,5  months5mg - 20mg,4/6/2016Email,Lexapro

This drug made it almost impossible to function as I was napping for 1-2 hours after work and would sleep for 10 hours every night and was still falling asleep at work.,This medicine helped to shut off my racing/obsessive thoughts almost completely. It was so nice to have a clear mind and not be overwhelmed by every day tasks that used to get me panicked. I genuinely never realised just how active my mind was until I started taking this medicine. Unfortunately the drowsiness was unbearable for me and I found it almost impossible to function  or move.

I felt super calm but not flat like I did on Zoloft.   I finally have been weaning off due to the sexual side effects and weight gain around my middle.  I felt like I looked pregnant_ it was awful.  I have been weaning off_ going from 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 to a tiny piece a week apart for each dosage.  I stopped altogether 2 weeks ago and the electricity running through my head is pretty bad.  That seems to be the only side effect for me going off.  I started taking Wellbutrin and it seems to help with some of that.,F,53,9  months20 1X D,11/8/2015,Lexapro

I couldn't be sad and I couldn't care about anything. It was a relief.,"- Most people don't start on 20mg_ it was an emergency. - If you have an ""inner critic""_ it takes that voice away and you feel like you're allowed to feel happy again.- DO NOT STOP COLD TURKEY. I stopped after three months because I felt better. I gained ten pounds. The depression took about for months after to come back. Not pleasant.- Loved this drug_ but if you don't like the feeling of uninterrupted calm_ I don't recommend it. You aren't overly happy or overly sad_ just stable.",F,21,3  months20,10/15/2015,Lexapro

46, 5, Post Partum depression and GAD,"First two weeks were a nightmare. I had no clue it was the side effect from the lexapro. I checked myself into the ER 3x in one week certain that I was dying. I vomited for three days straight. Heart palpitations for 2 weeks. Along with the ""brain zaps"" people tell about. And a feeling of eminent doom 24/7. Like you just saw a dog get hit by a car. They ran entire body scans and told me I was the healthiest person ever. Visited the psychologist who prescribed me and he promised if I just stuck with it_ it would pass. And he was right! Almost exactly after the second week I woke up one morning and I felt 100% better.  Xanax was the godsend to get me through the side effects. Take it as prescribed and it is your best friend.",I've read nothing but negative reviews on this drug. Some people even claim that the first day of taking the pill it was either aweful or amazing. Just know that you WILL NOT feel any effect for 3-5 days as it takes time for it to build up in your body. I started taking this for my Post Partum. I was to the point that if I even looked at my baby or heard his voice I wanted to vomit. I wanted nothing to do with him. I wanted him away from me as far as possible. I knew there was something wrong with that_ so I spoke to a psychologist and he prescribed me lexapro. I started off on 2.5 mg for one week. Then 5 the next week (those 2 weeks were the worst) then  I worked up to 10mg. I felt so much better but I still had the feeling of uneasiness. So he bumped me up to 15. That was the magic number. I was totally back to normal.  It's been 1yr now and my little baby is now 1.5 yrs old. I feel like I don't need it any more. So my dr has me stepping off. I've gradually taken down the dose by 2.5mgs each month just to be sure I don't experience withdrawals and guess what?! THERE HAVE BEEN NONE!!! Yay. I'm literally down to my last 30 days of this medicine and I feel awesome!DO NOT JUST QUIT COLD TURKEY. you must must must gradually lower the dose by a month at a time or you will suffer TERRIBLE consequences.,F,32,10  months15,9/1/2015Email,Lexapro
47, 1, severe depression_ panic disorder_,"My psych doc has tried me on every medication and medication combo possible. He decided to try Lexapro 20mg even though I had a bad reaction to Citalopram (same drug class). By day 2 I was feeling pretty good_ that night went into a seriously deep depression and had a bad panic attack in the middle of the night. Now_ day 4_ it's hard for me to get myself to go anywhere_ do anything or even be happy. I go back and forth either having a hard time sleeping or constantly being tired. Additionally_ I'm now snapping at people ""at the drop of a dime"" for stupid reasons and my heart rate increases to the point that it feels like it's going to burst out my chest. On top of that_ it takes HOURS for me to calm down after becoming agitated/angry over petty things and then I'm just exhausted. I'm a really calm and laid back person. I don't get angry or frustrated easily_ let alone growl at people. I'm also dizzy and unbalanced to the point that I can't walk straight and run into things or lose balance.

Start up side effects are common and can really stink_ but they do end.,F,26,1  days10 mg,8/6/2015,Lexapro
55, 4, Major Depression_ General Anxiety, - my mind feels a bit slower_ however this may simply be because I no longer constantly ruminate and feel more relaxed.  I have trouble getting motivated_ though I am thankfully able to stay motivated once I finally get started.   - constricted affect (clinical term).  Basically_ I don't feel things as deeply as I used to.  In a way it's good because I no longer wallow in misery in order to drive my creativity (which nearly led me to suicide several times).  However_ I have lost my creative drive in general as a result.  Every emotional stimulus feels watered down_ but then maybe I only feel that way because I assumed my prior hypersensitivity was normal_ even though it wasn't healthy.   - diminished libido and sexual sensitivity_ both physically and psychologically.  Even though I can achieve and maintain erections and I still feel pleasure_ it is difficult for me to orgasm.,Overall_ Lexapro is an extremely effective drug for eliminating deep depression and I recommend it wholeheartedly_ regardless of the side effects.  Lexapro has kept me in remission for almost 5 years now_ which has allowed me to make important behavioral and life changes so that hopefully someday I won't need it anymore.  I will say this_ however - if you are serious about curing your depression_ do not rely on the meds to do all the work for you.  Meds get the depression in remission so that you are capable of making whatever changes necessary to sustain remission upon cessation of treatment.  Harsh sacrifices have to be made if you want to get through this.  The side effects of this drug can take a serious existential toll in your life.  For me_ my lack of libido and emotional sensitivity has made it very difficult to develop romantic relationships.  I also lost my creativity_ which had defined me as a person for most of my life.  At first glance_ this may seem too steep a price_ but I am at the point now where I realize that giving up those things actually helped me to focus on recovering from past abuse that I had ignored_ as well as learn healthier coping mechanisms for dealing with stress and how to avoid negative thought patterns.  I have also been able to learn about love and healthy relationships from an objective viewpoint before jumping in naive and unprepared.  Ultimately_ I now have a more positive outlook on life.,M,26,5  years20mg 1X D,8/3/2015Email,Lexapro
56, 5, Generalised Anxiety,Lexapro calms my horny a bit -this is a good thing_ haha. Also_ my jaw gets tight and jittery jaw now & then_ but it goes away within a few minutes. The first 5 days was hard-going with headaches_ dizzy spells_ and feeling like I was in a time warp. That was all gone after a week.,Four weeks in with Lexapro_ and I'm feeling emotions I've never known before because my anxiety no longer takes over everything. I feel like this is what my 'normal' is. Lexapro was my last resort_ and_ I finally feel like ME. Going on Lexapro is one of the best decisions I've ever made.,M,31,4  weeks10mg,7/16/2015Email,Lexapro
57, 5, Anxiety_ adult ADHD,None (I have a tolerance to Buspar_ a similar drug_ so this could be why),I began taking Lexapro for my anxiety and ADHD symptoms as an addition to my Buspar regimen. Buspar and Lorazepam had been relieving (some) anxiety_ but did not put a dent in my focus issues. Lexapro did the trick! I feel calm but also focused_ something that Adderall or other ADHD drugs could not accomplish. I highly recommend this drug to adults who experience anxiety along with focus issues.,F,23, 5 mg 1X D,7/12/2015,Lexapro
58, 2, Anxiety_ stress,Dizzy_ drowsy_ tired_ sleep all day_ headache_ feel weak.,"This is a cleaner version of Celexa_ in terms of side effects yes but not sure otherwise. I feel drugged and only started with 5 mg. Takes until noon for me to really ""wake up"" Exercise is what keeps my spirits up and helps ease the stress but Lexapro took away all my energy and will to do anything. I'm getting off....",F,39,7  days10 mg 1X D,7/11/2015,Lexapro
