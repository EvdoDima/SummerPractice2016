0, 3, Diabetes Type 2,I took this med for 8 + years. In Nov.2012 I noticed both of my feet and ankles were swollen like tree trunks. I thought from too much tamales_ PC put me on 40 mg Lasix_didn't help. Went to diab.doctor_he said the actos ingredient was causing the swelling. Then prescribed Actos 1x daily and metformin 500 mg 2x daily. I don't take the actos because of the foot and leg swelling from before. My aBS is now 140-170_not good_but I've been on steroids for two weeks for sinus infection. Also made me gain weight_with Acto PlusMet.,,F,48,8  years15/850 mg,9/28/2013,Actoplus met
