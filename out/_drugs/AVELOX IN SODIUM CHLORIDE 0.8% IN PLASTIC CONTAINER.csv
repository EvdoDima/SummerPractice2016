0, 1, ,I want to say that this drug should be re-called and re-evaluated immediatly. 45 minutues after taking my very first dose I experienced severe tremors and an anxiety attack. At first I had no idea what was happening to me. My wife is diabetic_ I am not but I thought I was having some kind of low blood sugars. I was able to test my sugars with my wifes monitor and they came in at 95. I called my provider and made an appointment with the Doctor. By the time I got to see him I was still experiencing the tremors. The doctor immediatly took me off this stuff. I seem to be doing better now. If you doctor writes you a prescription for this medicine_ do your homework!!!!!,,M,60,2  days400 1X D,11/15/2010Email,Avelox in sodium chloride 0.8% in plastic container
