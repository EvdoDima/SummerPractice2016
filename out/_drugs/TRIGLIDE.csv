0, 3, High Triglycerides,Persistent abdominal pain_ gas and bloating_ particulary in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen.,My insurance dropped Tricor coverage_ so my doctor switched me to Triglide.  I was very happy with Tricor.  It worked very well and I did not have any side effects.  While the Triglide worked well in terms of lipid regulatio_ about a month in I developed nagging pains in my abdomen.  The pains varied in terms of duration and level_ but got progressively worse.  The pains were fairly consistent_ and did not improve with other medication/treatments.  After a while_ I started to think I might have developed ulcerative cholitis or an abdominal tumor.  I had my doctor switch me to generic fenofibrate_ and after about three weeks_ the pain is gone.  Only downside is I have to take the generic with food_ whereas Tricor and Triglide could be taken on an empty stomach.  I also don't know how well the generic is working_ because I have yet to get follow up blood work.,M,44,1  years160mg 1X D,1/17/2013Email,Triglide
