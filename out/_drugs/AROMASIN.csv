0, 1, Stage I/II Breast Cancer,The oncologist first prescribed Arimidex_ which I only took for 4 months due to the severe joint pain.  I could barely get in and out of my car.  I was then prescribed Aromasin and tried it for about 18 months and the hip pain became so bad I could not sleep and my cholesterol was almost 300.   So I took a six month vacation from the drug.  My cholesterol is now well under 200 and the hip pain is almost gone.,While I understand that the first five years after a cancer diagnosis are very important_ if I continue to take this drug I will end up on a statin and pain medicine.   Taking those will only cause even more side effects.   I am talking with a naturopath to look for some alternative ways to prevent any future occurrence of cancer_ there has to be a better way than this drug.,F,62,2  years25mg 1X D,7/27/2016Email,Aromasin
1, 1, breast cancer,Hot flashes_  joint pain in hands sometimes so bad I could not use fingers which I need to do my job.  One elbow joint pain.  Bladder pain and pressure like an infection but it wasn't an infection.   Antibiotics did not help.,"This drug is horrible for me.  My oncologist is NOT happy I stopped it and refuse to try it again.  I felt like I had a bladder infection but antibiotics did not clear it up.  Since I work in a lab I did my own urine tests and could see I had bladder irritation signs but no infection.  About 3 weeks after stopping the drug the bladder symptoms  are gone.  My knuckles in my hand hurt badly and I have trouble using my fingers and they ""lock""up sometimes.  I also have one elbow that hurts.  I talked to my oncologist nurse today who said I can go back on the meds since I have been off them a month and the hand pain is NOT from aromasin.  I am still having hot flashes.  I believe the drug is out of my system but the side effects and damage the drug causes is not gone which is why the hot flashes and pain is still there.  I told the nurse I will not take anything until the pain is less.  I know my body and I know from another drug I took years ago it can take MONTHS to get over the side effects and damage from the drug.  I wonder if it worth trying something else.  I was given a 4% chance of cancer returning with the drug and 8% without.  I had a mastectomy and no chemo or radiation needed.",F,60,50  days25 mg 1X D,7/12/2016Email,Aromasin
2, 2, Stage 1& Stage 2_ Dbl Mast_Chemo tx,Mainly_ severe mood swings - depression and anger/rage_ severe pain on my knees causing difficulty to walk after getting up then pain goes away_ insomia_ weight gain.,My mom was placed on same medication for 5years and saw the same SE on her.  On a side note_ breast ca doesn't run on our family.  We are both BRCA neg. Knowing the SE_ I was mindful of what I am feeling and I try to control the SE as much as I can.  I keep myself busy most of the days so I don't feel depressed.  As for the anger/rage_ I identified my trigger sources and I try to avoid them as much as I can (not 100% successful).  I watch what I eat but I'm also not 100% successful on this category.  I have gained weight (and I thought it was due to chemo tx).  My onc have given me clonazepam to help me sleep and relax at night.  I also take tylenol (with codeine) to help with the pain.  My onc also told me he thinks I should be on this drug for 10years (vs 5yrs for my mom) bec new study came out showing better outcome for my stage of cancer to stay on it for 10years.  I try not to think about this.,F,46,5  months25 1X D,5/20/2016Email,Aromasin

By the 5'th month had difficulty getting out of chairs and walking for first few minutes up. Knee pain and hip pain at night made sleeping very difficult. Dr switched to exemestane.  But I first stayed off both for a month.  Joint pain is better but will see what this month will bring.  Back cracking is bizarre.  At least I don't look 90 when I walk.

Heard horrific things about Boniva. Had lumpectomy and radiation one breast. Why be miserable? My prognosis is very good without drugs. I'm active and exercise. Feel I made good decision and still at low risk.,Oncologists practice cookie cutter medicine. They have a drug to combat side effects for other drugs. Not happy with how I felt on aromasin.

15, 1, Intraductal Papilloma w/Dysplacia,Although I was not diagnosed with BC_ I'm high risk since my mom is a bc survivor.  I've been on this drug going on 9 months. At first I didn't notice really any side effects except fatigue and that was after about a month.  A couple months later I started developing insomnia; joint pain in wrists_ hips_ ankles and feet.  After about 4 months on this drug_ I developed trigger finger in both thumbs.  There were days where it became exceptionally painful to walk because the bottom of my feet felt like they were on fire.When I went for my follow-up to see my onc_ I told her about the se's and as many of you have already experienced_ my onc was very dismissive about my complaints which I resented.At first I wasn't having any issues with weight gain because I'm a T1 diabetic who carefully watches what I eat but suddenly in less than 1 months' time I've gained almost 14 lbs!  I'm also going through horrible mood swings to the point I'm either crying uncontrollably or I'm feeling something akin to 'roid rage' all within a span of a couple minutes.Between the sudden weight gain and the extreme mood swings I am going to see my onc and tell her I want off this drug.,As a Type 1 Diabetic I got very sick in Aug 2015 and didn't realize I was in Diabetic Ketoacidosis and that by the time I was in ICU I'd had 2 mild heart attacks.  My Diabetes is a bigger threat to me right now than the chance of bc plus I don't know why the onc would put me on this drug given I don't have bc but high risk.  I don't like this 'one size fits all approach'.  Sure glad to find this website and have the kind of validation I need to show my doctor this is not 'all in my head'.My best to each and every one of you.,F,56,9  months25 mg,12/6/2015,Aromasin

Doctors dismiss pain_ fatigue_ swelling with ""it's better than cancer"" type comments flavored with ""we all get such aches as we age."" All this in less than a year.

18, 2, 2 year breast cancer survivor,I am experiencing synovitis of the hip and wondered if there was a connection to the Aromasin?  Also_ I was on Anastrazole and switched 10 months ago to Aromasin d/t the severe hip and knee pain and my inability to sleep.  I do sleep better now but the pain in the hips and knees can still get pretty bad.    Also_ two months after starting Aromasin_ I developed carpal tunnel syndrome (never had it before).  One month later I had the surgery to release it and there was still mild nerve damage that has not reversed.,"I noticed that some people are taking a ""vacation"" from taking Aromasin.

20, 2, Stage 2 Breast Cancer,Hot flashes (not too bad though)_ bad bone/joint pain_ forgetfulness_ weight gain_ sugar craving_ acne and rash_ some insomnia.,I was on Arimidex for 5 months and had to stop because of extreme bone pain. Exemestane SE are very bad. When I first get up in the morning I am literally hobbling around! I can barely walk_ my ankles are so weak and painful. I have to hold the handrail carefully when going down stairs as one of my ankles has given out on me several times. Back pain so bad that just shifting in a chair can elicit gasps from the pain. Turning over in bed very painful. Ankles_ knees and hips make popping/cracking noises. As many others have said_ I'm 57 but feel 97. One of the worst is weight gain. After my surgery & chemo_ I watched what I ate and lost 15 pounds - docs told me weight was super important - but since being on the AIs I have gained 20+ pounds with no change in eating habits. Losing any weight takes going to 600 calories a day (pretty hard to maintain). Exercise is difficult with the bone pain. Am now taking a mini vacation from it_ after just 7 days off of it_ pain is 2/3 gone_ brain fog is lifting_ I have energy again. I wanted to see how much of what I was experiencing was from the drug. Turns out_ all of it. The doctors just don't seem to understand how this drug can wreck your quality of life. I don't want cancer again_ but have to decide if all this is worth it.

21, 3, Stage 2a Invasive Ductal Carcinoma,Extreme muscle and bone pain that could not be controlled at all with over the counter meds such as Tylenol_ Ibuprofen_ ASA. Prescribed Meds like Tylenol #3_ then Buscopan patch then trimodal provided some relief but not enough. I had all the other side effects listed_ it was a total nightmare for me. I have just quit 10 months short of five years. I just can not deal with it any longer.,I know it is important to complete your full treatment course on Aromasin but when it becomes so unbearable_ you really need to weigh the risks and side effects you have with the drug vs the expected percentage rates for survival by taking the drug. With a mastectomy and chem alone I was told 93% with the five years on Tamoxifen the first year and a half_ then Aromasin for the same I was told an additional 3% putting me up to 96%. I feel  my survival rate should still be fairly high quoting it 10 months early.,F,61,2  years30 mg 1X D,8/24/2015,Aromasin

24, 1, Stage 1 Breast Cancer,I had taken Arimidex for 9 months and had increasing joint and muscle pain. I went off for a month and most side effects resolved. My oncologist switched me to Aromasin. In about 2 weeks the joint pain started coming back and then the swelling of hands_ feet plus tiredness. I am a nurse besides a patient and this is so uncomfortable. I am going to go off of this and won't even try Femora. I will give Tamoxifen a try in hopes the joint issues are not a problem. I am very active for my age_ have no other health issues and this drug has really affected the quality of my life. I have 4 more years of this type of treatment. My oncologist thinks this is better than Arimidex....Wrong! Hope other patients don't have this experience plus this drug costs more too!  I do my research and read.

28, 4, Breast cancer with bone mets,I already have serious osteoarthritis_ but I'm not feeling worse on the Aromasin. The only side effect I seem to have is extreme insomnia_ which is a real problem.,Right now this drug is saving my life! After 9 cancer-free years following diagnosis and treatment of Stage IIb ILC in both breasts_ I have a recurrence with bone metastases and am now Stage IV with no cure. I took Tamoxifen for 3 years the first time around and had no problems. Then switched to Femara for the worst 6 months of my life. I lasted a week on Arimidex before finally returning to Tamoxifen for the rest of my 5 years.  So I started Aromasin 5 months ago with trepidation because of my past history with AI's. My only problem is bad insomnia that I keep trying to deal with. I also receive an injection once a month of Xgeva to strengthen bones and alleviate bone pain. That's probably shielding me from the bone pain others are experiencing. I am so grateful that this drug has decreased my tumor markers 75% in 5 months and gotten them well within normal range. Because of the Xgeva I actually have less arthritis pain_ too. Now if I could just sleep better...,F,67,5  months25mg,6/2/2015Email,Aromasin

Went off of it and in 3 weeks I felt like a NEW person. Fatigue was gone_ pain was gone_ I could finally sleep and I felt ALIVE again. They have now switched me to arimidix. Was was Femara for 4 months and it almost gave me a heart attack. So we will see how Arimidix works. I think these AI drugs will soon tell the tale of how horrible they are.

37, 3, hi estrogen on testosterone therapy,Fatigue and pain was a problem within 7 days of beginning 25mg daily. Brain fog_ loss of motivation_ stiffness_ and just generally not feeling like doing anything_ even easy daily tasks.,Taking this to lower my estrogen levels after 6 months on testosterone replacement therapy. Testosterone is converted into estrogen in the male body and with testosterone replacement it sometimes gets converted at a higher rate leading to very high estrogen levels which can cause many issues from water retention_ male breast development_ and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. 25mg per day dropped my estrogen to nearly zero. The body uses estrogen for many things_ and getting it super low can cause many problems. Severe joint and bone pain_ fatigue_ depression_ anxiety_ sexual dysfunction are some of them.  Fortunately_ my doctor was very knowledgeable and had me switch to 12.5mg per day. After a month_ I was still struggling_ but not as bad. Estrogen levels tested as still being too low although not as low as before. So next I was told to use 12.5mg every other day. That proved to be the right dosage as it allowed my estrogen levels to balance out in the normal range for a male. Unfortunately for breast cancer patients_ the goal is typically to get estrogen levels extremely low. I am not sure if it is the mechanism that the estrogen is lowered by with the drug_ or if it is an issue of too little estrogen in the body for other functions to remain normal. But for my situation_ once I got my estrogen levels in the normal range_ the side effects were barely noticeable_ compared to before when they made me feel incapacitated.,M,39,60  days12.5mg 1X O,12/14/2014,Aromasin

Oh_ and my favorite side effect?  I gained 30-35 pounds in a matter of months & CAN'T get it off!,I started taking the Aromatase Inhibitors in 2009. My docs tried to tell me that my bone-muscle-joint pain was because of my age (60s) and my weight. It was just ordinary arthritis they all said. Hogwash! I am so tired of doctors laying every health problem on my age or my weight when it is one or more of the drugs I am on. Here's how I know my symptoms are Aromasin drug-related: Every time I take an Aromasin Medication Vacation_ most of my Aromasin side effects go away. And_ I started on Arimdex and then Femara and had the SAME side effects. I stayed on Aromasin since there were no other options. I have not had a 1-month vacation from the Aromasin for 4 years_ but when I did_ my pain decreased. Since I reached my 5 years on this awful drug_ the choice is mine to stay on it or go off. I decided to take another vacation. Within a week_ my pain is nearly all gone and my other symptoms are also improving. I can't believe how much better I feel. I feel like I have my life back. I don't know if I will go back on Aromasin or not. What's the point of taking a drug that makes your daily life a hell? Not what I call a quality life.

It made my bone hurt so bad eventually I could not even get out of bed it was horrible_ my regular doctor prescribed me hydrocodone for the pain I was in I am currently on tamoxifen and am very happy oh I forgot to tell you about the other side effects not sleeping_ anxiety_ my life was not worth living and I often wondered with the amount of money we give to cancer research the medications should be at least tolerable it's horrible to have to go through this and keep thinking if you don't take the medication your going to get cancer again.

55, 3, bc/st 1/nonmet./6.1 cm/est. pos,,3/11/13 -The hotflashes have improved somewhat. However_ I am sick of the constant perspiring!! My skin is messed up (was always complimented on my skin looking so young before). Aged. Am on DHEA cream for vag. dryness. Seems to help. The headaches at night are maddening. I NEED SLEEP. I was only stage one with no metastases (spelled right?)  Had total mastectomy with recon. I wonder if this is necessary. Dr. said contributing to osteopenia (precursor to osteoporis).AS OF 4/25_ onc gave permission to go off!!!  Said no proof after 5 years of hormone therapy that there is any further benefit.  Said my prognosis is 99%plus because I did the hormone therapy.  I went 7 years_ so it is pretty certain.  Onc said because I had chemo before surgery_ had total mast._ and have been clean for 7 years with the hormone therapy and because of the type of cancer it was_ my prognosis is practically 100% without further aromasin or subs.

58, 3, Stage 1 Breast Cancer,Haven't really experienced any side effects with Aromasin to date.   I had breast cancer 9 years ago and took  tamoxifen (no effects) for three years and then Femara.  Femara made me feel like I was 100 years old.  I took for two years and then quit.  I think that it was over several months that it made me feel that way.  It seemed like it was a cumulative effect over time.   So far_ tho_ so good with Aromasin.  We'll see over time,,F,54,2  months25 mg 1X D,11/11/2012Email,Aromasin
