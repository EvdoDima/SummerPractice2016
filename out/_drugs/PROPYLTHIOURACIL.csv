0, 1, hyperthyroidism,Stomach pain_ racing heart rate_ pain in the right side of the stomach_ nauseous_ heavy chest_ sore throat with phlegm,I have had severe side effects_and the bad news is this pill was not effective as my t3 and t4 hormones level are even higher when compared to the levels before I start this drug. Feeling so sad.,F,31,1  months100 MG,12/5/2015Email,Propylthiouracil
1, 1, Grave's Disease,Digestive problems_ shortness of breath_ joint pain and irritability.,My original doctor wanted to inject radioactive iodine into my thyroid_ which I refused. She wanted to remove my thyroid_ which I refused. I agreed to take Propylthiouracil_ but she did not warn me about any side effects and then I moved interstate_ where my new doctor was concerned about the strength and frequency of my dosage_ so I stopped taking it immediately. I changed my diet. No gluten_ no grains_ no refined sugar_ no processed foods and minimal dairy. 30 minutes of exercise daily. 30 minutes of sunshine daily. 2 litres of filtered water daily. My readings returned to normal after 3 months and I am not on any medication or any supplements.I still have digestive problems_ which are attributed to the long term effects of this drug.,F,48,240  daysunsure 4X D,12/12/2014Email,Propylthiouracil
2, 1, Over-active thyroid,Took alongside thyroxin for 12 months. Despite normal blood levels I began to put weight on throughout the period of taking the drug.,I have never been able to lose the weight_ my thyroid is now under-active as it was before the brief period of over activity and I now take 100mcg of thyroxin daily. I believe that the drug has somehow permanently changed my metabolism and would never take it again. I  believe that the consultant should have waited to see if my thyroid levels dropped to normal on their own for a couple of months instead of wading in with this over-zealous use of propylthiouracil drug treatment. Now_ no matter what I eat or whatever exercise I do_ nothing helps at all with my weight.,F,57,1  years100mg 1X D,5/13/2012Email,Propylthiouracil
3, 3, hyperthyroidism,After 1 year_I began to have back pain then--excruciating pain on right side of abdomen. I also had no appetite. I reported this pain to my doctor who advised an abdominal sonagram. On checking the internet for contraindications_ I found that my symptoms indicated my liver was being negatively impacted by the drug.I insisted on stopping the drug immediately although I was told that I could just lower the dosage.,Even if your initial reaction to this and other drugs is okay_ your doctor should continue to check for and advise you of all side effects. A bad side effect doen't always appear immediately; it can occur after long term use.,F,50,14  months,10/13/2009,Propylthiouracil
4, 4, Hyperthyroidism/Grave's Disease,I was diagnosed with this condition while trying to get pregnant and was put on 100 mg of PTU for mild hyperactive thyroid.  I have more of a problem with how the endocrinologist handled my case than the PTU itself.  The most noticeable side effects I have had_ which occurred early on_ was weight gain that would not stop_ fatigue_ and rapid heart beat.  Before taking the PTU I hadn't really lost weight due to hyperthyroidism_ so the weight gain was not a good thing.  The endocrinologist had me on 100 mg a day and would not lower the dosage to stop the weight gain.  I since moved on to a different physician and I only take 50 mg a day now which has been the norm for the last eight years.  I have not been able to loose much of the weight_ but I have not gained anymore due to the med.  One nice thing is that when you are pregnant hyperthyroidism goes into remission and you don't need to take the PTU.  I had to pick it back up about three months after giving birth - I became exessively fat,The biggest thing I wonder about with this med is why they can't make it coated.  The taste is awful!,F,45,8  years,11/27/2007,Propylthiouracil
5, 2, hyperthyroid,chills_ low fever_ muscle aches_ sore throat_ fatigue,I used PTU successfully during my last bout with Grave's Disease. This time almost immediately I had a bad reaction. I saw 3 doctors over 2 weeks who all failed to look into the symptoms thoroughly and I ended up with a low white blood cell count.My pharmacist gave the best advice early on about the symptoms!,F,47,15  days,8/1/2007,Propylthiouracil
6, 4, hyperthyroidism,On 300 mg a day my hair started falling out.  I cut myself down to 200 mg a day and it stopped.  Doctor approved the reduction of the dose.  Otherwise it worked on my symptoms: lower body weakness_ pounding heart_ trembling in hands.,,F,63,12  years,9/21/2006,Propylthiouracil
7, 5, OVER ACTIVE THYROID,WORKED RIGHT AWAY APPROXIMATELY 3 WEEKS...I WAS ABLE TO PUT BACK ON MY LEAN MASS RIGHT AWAY...DOCTOR HAS NOW CUT MY DOSAGE FROM 300MG TO 200MG....NOW...,HELPED ME A LOT...ESPECIALLY WITH MUSCLE BUILDING.,M,27,3  months,7/7/2004Email,Propylthiouracil
8, 1, hyperthyroidism,Bad stomach pain literally could not lay on stomach_ esophageal pain_ quick exacerbation of mild chest congestion to bronchitis_pain in right upper quadrant_ neuropathy pain presently already had was exacerbated.  When stopped started with intractable nausea on medicine for nausea presently still being evaluated for that have to see gastroenterologist.,,F,51,5  days,8/9/2003,Propylthiouracil
