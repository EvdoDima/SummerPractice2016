Withing days of taking myself off the statin_ all better.  It did work to improve all my numbers but  at what cost.  Along w/ the continual rotating joint pain and loss of flexibility and joint stiffness_ I also had slight mental fog_ reduced energy levels_ reduced muscle mass showing up. After repeadted complaints and multiple appts_ all to no avail_ I finally  took my self off the meds with almost immediate improvement across the board. Now i'm in the process of finding an alt primary care who who is better tuned in_ more well versed_  and is willing to more effectively advise_ g,,M,61,3  months20 1X D,5/12/2014,Advicor

4, 1, to lower my cholesterol,I took 500mg for 3 years_ then after my PCP doubled the dose_ I began to experience severe neuropathy and myopathy in my hands_ arms and legs.,Although the drug lowered my cholesterol_ it attacked my nerves and muscles and made a cripple out of me.,M,51,3  years,7/19/2007Email,Advicor
5, 3, High Cholesterol,Heavy flushing_ especially of my face. Aspirin helps some. I have a headache in the morning. No real improvement in my numbers over Lipitor. Caused my blood sugar to go up. My wife says it makes me grumpy. Maybe she is just agitating me more.,My numbers actually were worse with Advicor than with Lipitor. I do not think I like this drug given the poor results and the way it makes me feel. I also have Type 2 Diabetes which seems to complicate the issue. Advicor raised my blood sugar average by about 15%. I am going to ask my doctor to change me to something else.,M,57,6  months,5/28/2007,Advicor
