0, 4, ,Worked well to ease back spasms_ but made me sluggish and tired. Also made my mouth dry.  But I will put up with these side effects because the spasms were much worse.,,M,69,3  days5 2X D,10/31/2015,Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride
1, 2, muscle spasms pain,Cause my spasms and back pain to get much worse when took a whole pill at bed time.,I have been taking this med as needed for years_ usually only a half a pill at bedtime and didn't have any problems with it. Recently I threw out the middle of my back and was having very bad muscle spasms so started taking a whole pill at bedtime. I would sleep for an hour_ then the med would kick in and the pain was so bad in my back it would wake me up and keep me awake. I would have to take an RX pain pill to stop the pain it was so bad. I rarely take the RX pain pill and usually only a half...here I was taking a whole one every night. Did some searching on here and elsewhere on the net to see if this could make the spasms and pain worse...found a scattered few who also experienced this. So last night I didn't take the muscle relaxant and finally had a peaceful nights sleep without being woken up with terrible back pain. Wish I had figured it out sooner_ the last couple of weeks have been so horrible with this pain_ every since I started taking a whole muscle relaxant.  I may never use this medication again. I have alot of back problems and thought this was helping...now realizing it may have been making things worse all along. They should let people know it can cause what its suppose to help with..,F,54, 10 mg 1X D,7/19/2015Email,Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride
