0, 1, PCOS. Spotting in between periods,Acne to chest and back. Bloating. Mood swings,I've been on many bcp since I was 16 due to PCOS. I kept spotting in between my periods so my doctor put me on demulon. Since being on demulon_ I've had acne to my chest and back and getting large pimples on my face which I never had before. There's been no change in my periods. I still get them for 7 days and they are heavy. I am very short tempered and moody on this bcp. Not a fan of demulon,F,23,3  months,2/26/2015,Demulen 1/35-28

2, 4, Acne/Pregnancy Prevention,First four months on Zovia 1/35E it improved my mood swings_ I gained weight_ about 8 pounds_ boobs increased about a cup size_ I felt very bloated all the time. Acne got really bad up until the four month mark.  Acne completely cleared with the ocassional pimple here & there near the end of my fourth month on the pill. Weight went back down a bit (about 5 pounds but I also exercise almost everyday) and I didnt really have much of a bloated feeling after that. And I have had no pregnancies on the pill.,Everybody is different you have to give it time before it adjusts to your body. I almost stopped taking the pill on the fourth month until I saw it started clearing up my acne majorly.,F,19,6  months 1X D,4/15/2014Email,Demulen 1/35-28
3, 5, birth control,No noticeable side effects_ may get moody around period time_ lighter periods(1-3 days)_ can miss periods up to 3 months in a row.,I started taking Demulen 9 years ago. I never had any side effects_ except noticing that a few days before my periods_ I may get moody_ depresss_ but it only last about 2-3 days. No weight gain_ clearer skin_ don't feel any different_ no babies!,F,30,9  years 1X D,6/30/2012,Demulen 1/35-28
4, 4, Birth Control,Worst - heat rash_ sensitive skin_ extra hair. Some bloating and possibly mood swings :)_ sore nipples. Some periods missed consecutively_ screw up on the pills at all and get spotting.,I just recently discovered that this is probably what has been giving me sun sensitive skin_ easily getting heat rash and burning quicker. I just now read that it can increase hair growth and am pretty sure that has happened too_ my arm hair is LONG and everywhere_ and I get lots of mutant long hairs on my back_ face and arms frequently. Plus I have hairy hands and feet. But no kids_ so it worked that way_ and I had tried many other kinds in a couple years with always bleeding through. Demulen did give me 3 day barely there periods which was nice_ but worrysome when it didnt come for 3 months. Stopping because I want to see if I notice any difference in myself not on it_ hoping for no more heat rash_ its itchy and ugly.,F,29,12  years30 1X D,6/28/2012,Demulen 1/35-28
5, 4, POF_ Early Menopause,Main complaint: no Libido_ didn't even want to be touched by my husband. I am no longer on this pill because of the libido problems.Sore breasts_ bloating a few days before periodAcneGood symptoms (for me): increased breast size_ increased appetite_ increased weight.,I was put on this to help me get my periods back and stop my ovaries from dying. I have Premature Ovarian Failure and Early Menopause symptoms. This pill brought back my periods and made me gain weight (I was very underweight).This BC pill is the first one that hasn't given me severe mood swings or depression. Wayyy better than Alesse that way.PS: If you're just starting this pill_ give it some time!! The first 2 or 3 months can be rough until your body adjusts.,F,25,1.5  years 1X D,2/29/2012,Demulen 1/35-28
6, 1, Birth control,Severe depression_ incressed acne_ heavy breakthrough periods_ mood swings.,This pill was recommnded to my doctor because i am plus size and could not take have the patch. She said it would help my acne and lighten my periods. Although it did indead lighten my period_ the side effects were so harsh over time I had to switch. Over time i became severly depressed during random parts of my day. I cried for no reason_ and could not seem to lighten my moods. My acne was twice as bad as it had been_ especially around the time of my period. I had stopped taking this pill for two months when i was very stressed over work and having 2-3 periods a month_ and within a week of not taking Demulen my face seemed much cleaner and my moods better. I did go back on this pill_ and the side effects came back just as bad. I have now switched and feel much better.,F,19,8  months30 1X D,6/17/2011Email,Demulen 1/35-28

8, 2, Acne,More acne_ tender/enlarged breasts_ emotional_ fatigue,I started taking demulen for my chest/back acne_ and it has not gone away in 3 weeks. It has progressively gotten worse.

10, 2, Birth Control,I was on Demulen 1/35 when I was 21 and I didn't even notice it.  No side effects and I could time my periods by the second.  They were super light and only lasted 3 days with no cramps. I am now 43 and only Zovia is available.  I've been on it two weeks and am bleeding like I'm having a period and having horrible cramps.  I hope this doesn't last long.  I tried the ortho nova patch before this and it was an absolute nightmare.  Nausea_ enlarged tender breasts and bad depression.  This bleeding and cramping isn't much better.  I was fine for the first two weeks until this.  I wish the real Demulen was still available instead of this generic stuff.,,F,43,14  days1/35 1X D,10/14/2010,Demulen 1/35-28

12, 5, birth control,No side effects ever in 6 years!!,This was great for 6 years. It did take me about a year and a half to get pregnant after stopping this pill. I took the name brand_ not the generic. Then after the birth of my son_ I tried this again_ however they had stopped making the name brand so I had to take the generic_ zovia the second time around. It was horrible. It was not the same. I had to stop taking it after 2 weeks.,F,32,6  years,11/23/2009,Demulen 1/35-28
13, 4, heavy flow_ cramps_ moods,I was on alese for 5 months and felt very sick and it didnt really help me with my moods around the time of the month. So I was switched to demulen and straight away I had no more moods but I have missed completly quite alot of my periods out of this year I think ive missed about 8 periods out of 12 and the others have been nothing but light spottting for less than 24 hours. Overall it has helped me alot but can also be quite confusing.,,F,18,14  months,7/10/2009,Demulen 1/35-28
14, 2, Heavy Periods/ Cramps,I have been on Zovia 35 for 2 months now. The first month was ok no period_ which I loved. On the second pack/month I started bleeding. The bleeding has not stopped its been a little over a month now and I'm still bleeding. It has gone from spotting on and off to a flow like a regular period. My breats are constantly sore and have become extremely enlarged. My sex drive is almost completely diminished. Can't really tell if I've gained weight simply because I'm always a little heavier when I'm bleeding/blotted.,Blotting_Enlarged and sore Breasts_ mood swing_ no sex drive.,F,26,2.5  months,6/6/2009,Demulen 1/35-28

16, 1, sister taking it for birth control,She died (age 35) of multiple pulmunary embolism in 1989 after taking this for many years.  Only possible cause of death found by the coroner was long term use of birth control pills. She had a healthy married life.,I just found the brand she used while sorting through some old boxes of stuff & thought I would look it up on the web. Perhaps this will help others not take this RX.,F,,15  years,1/26/2009,Demulen 1/35-28

20, 2, Birth Control,Nausea_ Moodiness_ Headache,Have only been taking Zovia for a week and it has given me really bad nausea.  It has also made me very moody and I have been very irritable (I almost feel like I cant go into work anymore because my co-workers are getting on my nerves so much). Today I have had a really bad headache which won't go away.  I took Ortho-tri cyclen before but my insurance no longer covers it.

25, 3, birth control/ reduce heavy crampin,tender breast around period time_ weight gain from the belly button to the mid thigh_ horrible cramps_ headaches two weeks before period_ very very low sex drive.,When I first was changed to this pill it was great because it got rid of my migraine headaches I was getting from pill before. Now I get bad headaches two weeks before my next period. Sometimes my breasts are tender_ sometimes they are not. Sometimes I have extremely heavy periods_ sometimes they only last a day. My weight gain in my hip/thigh area sucks!!!!!! I don't eat differently_ I workout 3/4 times a week and I have gained about 15 lbs since January when I was put on this pill. I hate it. I hate that every month is different. My sex drive is so low_ I don't even want him to touch me. I feel so bad for him.,F,26,6  days,7/26/2007,Demulen 1/35-28
26, 5, Birth control,Bloating when starting new pack,Hi there. I wrote the 5th and 6th comments under this one. Anyway. It's been about 3 months or so and I am loving this pill. I love it because I don't even really realize I'm on it. I have only ONE side effect and that's the monthly bloating after the white pills. Other than that it's great. I seem to have lost a couple more pounds as well. Again_ I have no clue if it's the pill or not but it very well could be. :),F,22,3  months,7/13/2007,Demulen 1/35-28

28, 4, birth control_ acne,bloating at first_ HUGE increase in sex drive (which isn't always a good thing...)_ acne flare-up at first but now going away_ NO appetite AT ALL,"I've been taking Zovia for about 2 weeks. I changed from yasmin (which was HORRIBLE for me) and ortho tricycl. low (which also didn't work for me) and this seems to work well for me.  I had bloating at first and an acne flare-up_ but both seem to be going away.  I feel great on the pill...although it is only now that I'm getting my appetite back (this was really really dramatic for me_ it had to be the pill).  Overall_ I like it so far.  Demulen is supposed to be one of these ""ol'trusty"" pills in comparison to some of the newer fancy ones like Yasmin or Loestra_ but it seems to work better for me.",F,23,14  days,6/13/2007,Demulen 1/35-28
29, 4, Birth control.,Slight weight gain_ bloating.,This is the third bc pill I've been on in 2 years. All others have caused spotting in the 3rd week. I've only been on this one a month but so far so good. I quit smoking this month too so many of the side effects could be due to that -- headaches/bloating/crankiness.,F,30,1  months,5/20/2007,Demulen 1/35-28
30, 2, Prevent Pregnancy,Moderate to severe leg cramps.  Painful breast and nipple tissue.  Severely decreased sex drive_ to the point of not wanting to be touched at all.  Slight to moderate depression.  SEVERE menstrual cramps.  Feelings of nausea 2 - 4 hours after taking pill,I was switched to Demulen after taking Aviane for 5 years (experienced erratic bleeding which led to switch).  Took this pill for two weeks before I called the doctor and had her switch me.  Felt much better after not taking pill for two days_ but HORRIBLE cramps.  Like all medications_ what works for one won't work for another.  It's not that I don't recommend this medication_ it just did not work for me.,F,24,2  weeks,5/20/2007,Demulen 1/35-28
31, 4, Birth Control,Spotting.,"Hi again. Just checking in. It's me. I wrote the two comments under this. Anyway. It's been a month on Zoia 1/35E. At first I had some not so great side effects such as minor acne_ bloating and a ""killer migraine"" but turns out the migraine was due to a toothache! The bloating goes away within the 2nd week as well as the acne. The only side effect I have now is spotting. My period seemed to be super short as well (about a day or two) and there were no cramps. I have to say_ I am glad my doctor put me on this pill. I really think it's a great pill now. :) GO ZOVIA! Hahah. Oh yes. Decreased appetite. I'm not 100% sure if it's due to the pill. I believe that partly it is. Anyway. I was 105 to start- 8 days in still same weight but seemed heavier due to the sudden major bloating -end of the month and I weight 102 and no bloating! But remember... It's not a miracle weight-loss pill; for some reason I just don't want to snack as much or as often.",F,22,1  months,5/18/2007,Demulen 1/35-28
32, 3, Zovia 1/35 -Birth Control,Killer migraines. Bloating.,First BC pill ever. Day 8 on Zovia (same as Demulen). There aren't very many side effects except for a killer migraine and bloating. Loss of appetite_ although I don't look any thinner due to the major bloating. The migraine is pretty obnoxious though. I NEVER get headaches or migraines so when I started getting them (around day 2) I thought it was a toothache...but it's not. The migraines feel like someone stabbed me in the head with a screwdriver. I take 4 Advil and it *somewhat* goes away. I would almost say it's worth it_  but I could surely do without it. Thinking about just going to an IUD. I hate being bloated.,F,22,8  days,5/2/2007,Demulen 1/35-28
33, 3, Zovia 1/35 -Birth Control,Migraines. Bloating. (I totally forgot!!!)--> Mild acne. ,First BC pill ever. Day 8 on Zovia (same as Demulen). There aren't very many side effects except for a killer migraine_ mild acne and bloating. Loss of appetite_ although I don't look any thinner due to the major bloating. The migraine is pretty obnoxious though. I NEVER get headaches or migraines so when I started getting them (around day 2) I thought it was a toothache...but it's not. The migraines feel like someone stabbed me in the head with a screwdriver. I take 4 Advil every couple hours and it *somewhat* goes away. I would ALLLMOST say it's worth it_ but...now that I think about`it...not really. I could surely do without it. Thinking about just going to an IUD. I hate being bloated. And the migraines. And the mild acne. I've NEVER had skin problems before and now I get these tiny little pimples around my chin. It's not really noticable at all but I had crystal clear skin so I totally see the difference.,F,22,8  days,5/2/2007,Demulen 1/35-28
34, 5, birth control,,I have been on Demulen for 17 years and have no complaints.  One added benefit other than birth control is the fact that you can pretty much know the time and day your period is going to start_ length is shorter and flow is lighter.  I have recently been told that they have discontinued Demulen and I am somewhat disappointed to have to change from something that has worked so well.,F,38,17  years,4/27/2007,Demulen 1/35-28

43, 1, Contraception/Cramps,Extremely low sex drive_ did not take away cramps or breast tenderness.,This is the third pill I have been on in the last several years.  I started on this pill because my cramps and breast tenderness were so extreme on the other pills I had tried.  Unfortunately_ since I began taking this pill_ I have absolutely no sex drive.,F,23,1  years,5/14/2006,Demulen 1/35-28
44, 4, Contraception and Cramps,"Weight gain (especially around the belly area - ""love handles"")_ flattened affect_ decreased sex drive_ severe mood swings in week before period.",Initially started taking Demulen for control of heavy periods and debilitating cramps (3+ days in bed per month!). Now I bleed lightly for only 2-3 days a month_ no cramps. Light spotting for a month when I first started at age 17. I will say that Demulen's effectiveness is worth the weight gain (from ~100 lbs to 120)_ the flattened affect (I just don't feel emotions as strongly as before)_ decreased sex drive (from ~ 4-5x per week to maybe once per month)_ and severe mood swings (feeling unprovoked anger with bf_ crying for no reason/inconsequential things - only for last week of pill). My sister tried Alesse and became a moody crazy woman who tried to kill her bf_ so I'll stick to Demulen! No reason to change!,F,24,7  years,5/3/2006,Demulen 1/35-28

46, 3, to decrease pms,Moodiness -- although this is nothing compared to the anger that Yasmin gave me; incredible fatigue_ although that may be because I've been swtiching between different bc pills; increased vaginal discharge.

49, 1, BC,Severe depression_ anxiety_ hallucinations,Being on this pill was the scariest time in my life.  I was severely depressed and crying constantly.  I would greatly overreact to any stressful situation.  Additionally_ I was terrified of my husband who has never given me anything to fear.  I was sure he was going to kill me.  I have little recollection of this time_ but have been told about it.  I felt as if I were watching myself from outside my body and couldn't control my outrageous emotions.
