0, 3, Chronic Pain,It worked well at the beginning but over the years caused Anxiety_ weight gain_ major adrenal and hormonal issues_ very difficult to taper off.,I took this drug because I was in too much pain to work. It kept me going to work for over 6 years but eventually the side effects were too much. The taper was very difficult and time consuming (3 years - unable to work the last two). I was at a very high dose for pain but I believe if I was at a lower dose I might not have had so many side effects.,F,49,8  years24 mg max,9/10/2015,Subutex
1, 4, Better option than relapsing,Same as opiates less intense,This drug was the first drug I have ever discovered_ that my brain had no want to abuse. I have been taking 1/4 of a pill a day for two years now. I never thought it possible to be happy on just a quarter a day!! I thought I found my miracle drug.After two years however I have been finding my self depressed randomly and I cry for no particular reason. So with turning 30 looming around the corner l made a drastic change. I quit my job_ was honest with everyone why! You know why honesty is hard. It's like we are hidden_ no body knows the true me and the struggles an addict deals with_ so we hide from everyone. I am glad too report I am 5 days into my detox and although it is not even close to as easy as I thought it would be for the first time in awhile I am feeling like my self again. When we are hi 24/7 everything seems like a dream and that is no longer sufficient for me! I want real memories and I want to connect with people on an honest level. I have walked every walk of life there is from being a bum on the street to a general manager of a 2million dollar business. From drug addict to construction chief. From inmate to head chef!! I have never let drugs stand in the way of my dreams. I smoke a pack a day and still jog 2 miles everyday. every walk of life I have endured has only shown me that everyone deals with issues. It has to be about you!! You have to want it and be willing to do whatever it takes to get what you want out of life! I was willing to tell a judge lock me,M,29,2  years1 mg,5/31/2015Email,Subutex
2, 5, opiate detox,Loss of libido entirely_ my relationship has suffered greatly from this libido issue. Psychological upset when treatment ceased. Subutex (buprenorphine) saved my life. Methadone left me feeling like a junkie with sweats and aches daily but subutex is like being clean_ I tapered my dose from 8mg to my current 1mg over 6 months and will be drug free within this month. Feel fantastic. I know from previous withdrawal however that once I'm off the subutex I will start craving heroin again. The circle will repeat.,,F,26,6  months8mg,9/9/2014,Subutex
3, 5, Opioid addiction maintenance & pain,Constipation,As a recovering addict_ this medication does *NOT* get me high whatsoever and despite being a partial opioid agonist_ it helps relieve some pain but is only moderately effective.  It was a very uncomfortable transition from large doses of Methadone to Buprenorphine but the discomfort lasted around 3-5 days. This medication has given me my life back however and because it bonds so strongly to the opiate receptors in your brain_ it will block other opiates while it's still in your system so you won't get high from them which is a great tool to prevent lapse-in-judgment relapses.  There is a generic out now that is much less expensive.,M,28,9  months8 MG 2X D,8/7/2013Email,Subutex

5, 2, chronic back pain,"What my side effects on it were: Decreased sex drive (almost to a halt)_ insomnia & sleep paralysis_ anxiety_ memory issues_ difficulty concentrating_ palpitations_ hair is falling out & springs then snaps_ teeth ache & chipping_  & nails fold & are ridged all down beds-  (read that subutex inhibits absorption of calcium)_ chronically fatigued_ my husband says I don't show emotion & my friends say my ""joy is gone"". I was put on every opiate I can think of in 2001post car accident. After liking them way to much & dosages being upped & upped I was switched to methadone. That was upped eventually to 335mg per day. Bad things came about from the methadone & I thought subutex was the answer. I began at 8mg suboxone- was eventually switched to subutex & worked up to 32mg subQ. The side effects did not come on at once. Insomnia & low sex drive were the beginning. I am at home detoxing now- jumped off at .33mg per day. I have made it into day 18.. maybe that's because I had taken it for 8 yrs & methadone 2 prior to that. My neurotransmitters have alot of self correcting to do. Symptoms of detox are coming and going now & the worst is over. The 1st 7 days were physically tough for me. The next 7 days the emotional detox started & physical symptoms were lighter.  Now I'm trying to regain strength & say goodbye to the off & on physical symptoms & I'm starting to see a bit more sleep. Did it help my pain? -yes.",,F,35,8  years32mg,5/15/2013,Subutex
6, 4, Opiate Dependency,ZERO sex drive_ some constipation_ some drowsiness,"I began taking Subutex after experiencing nasty side effects while on Suboxone. I've heard that for some people_ the Naloxone/Buprenorphine mix is bad; guess I was one of them. Subutex does the job in curbing opiate cravings. I do notice_ however_ that I get more of a temporary ""high"" feeling from Subutex than I did from Suboxone. This is why some addiction specialists will only prescribe Subutex to those who have demonstrated responsibility; apparently Subutex is much easier to abuse due to the lack of Naloxone as a deterrent. Because the name brand is so expensive_ I go with generics but have learned a few things from the different formulas. There are some crappy generics_ one of which is called Hi-tech (or something like that) and it is carried at Walgreens. This formula dissolves incredibly fast which renders the levels of the drug in the bloodstream erratic. This could lead to the need to take the drug more often. I found that Teva brand was excellent (operative word being ""was"" since their patent expired) so the next best is Roxane brand. I found that some days I need even less of my usual dose because Roxane brand works so well since it dissolves slowly. In all_ Subutex has helped although the lack of libido is slowly killing my once happy marriage. I am in the process of tapering my dose (went from an initial 16mg a day down to my current 5mg) so I hope to get my libido back.",F,35,2  years5mg 1X D,3/17/2013Email,Subutex
7, 1, chronic physical scoliosis pain,"Insomnia_ being treated like a drug addict after decades of terrible chronic physical pain_ banned from any hope of future pain treatment. no matter what happens to me_  because of the ""addict"" label_ fear of errors in hospitals because MDs can't remember the endlessly proliferating opiate brand names.",I was told by a pain mgmt MD that Suboxone was a pain med. It is not. I switched to Subutex after the horrors of the Naloxone (Narcan) added to Subutex which = Suboxone. Now I am in as much pain as before Suboxone but must live with the constant fear of accident or illness that will cause more pain because both are incompatible with opiates. Sellers of these drugs claim tolerance can't happen_ but this is not true if you are in pain; they're no different from opiates in this way.,,,5  months6-32 1X D,10/2/2012,Subutex

9, 3, Opioid Addiction,Constipation_ Urinary Retention (difficulty voiding)_ headaches_ nausea_ episodes of panic_ decreased sex drive_ joint aches,"This medication does very well at controlling the cravings for opiates but the side effects have been a nightmare. I've only been on this medication one month so far- and it is doing it's job but I feel terrible. My body maybe unable to handle the medication therefore my options are to switch to another medication or taper off the Subutex ""for good.""",F,20,1  months8 mg 3X D,5/29/2012,Subutex
10, 3, Addiction to Prescription Pain Meds,Constipation_ Itchy_ No Sex Drive_ Depression at Doses under 1MG_ Sometimes feeling skin discomfort_ Nausea (Occasional)_ Insomnia_ Food Cravings_ Thirsty_ Drowsy,I started using Suboxone first before Subutex I was addicted to Pain Killers. I never shot up_ snorted my meds. Simple addiction traded for something I believe is worse. It keeps my withdrawal symptoms at Bay and keeps me from wanting other Opiates. The side effects are horrible. I started at 4mg comfortably and have made my way down to .25mg. I tried going off the medication entirely and couldn't do so momentarily. You have to have no other obligations or anything going on because detox is rough. Looking back I should have detoxed from previous meds and by now I would be feeling alot better instead I am still at square one. On a positive note. I am more productive on the meds. I didn't keep up on things while abusing pain meds. I have made alot of life changes since the transition. I actually was able to see the changes I needed to make. I just think it's harder because this stuff is so much stronger.   So please make a informed decision before starting subutex_ suboxone or buprenorphone treatment. Remember withdrawal is inevitable. Coming from someone who actually takes their meds like they are suppose to and not a dr. writing a script.,F,25,6  months.25 1X D,11/16/2011Email,Subutex
11, 4, opiate addiction,constipation_ lowered sex drive_ some nights I experience insomnia (only if dose was taken too soon before bed)_ I'm a tobacco smoker_ and tend to smoke more after taking a dose_ cravings for starches/sugar.,I began taking Subutex after finding that Suboxone's side effects were too overwhelming! I had a pretty substantial problem with opiates_ both pain pills and heroin_ and sought treatment in Jan. 2010. I can say that Buprenorphine itself has helped me tremendously; I have not abused any opiates since. I started with Suboxone but I found that after 2 months I had severe constipation_ zero sex drive_ and my menstrual cycles were crazy irregular. Thankfully I have a doctor who was willing to try Subutex with me. He said that for some reason_ a lot of his female patients were having problems with the other ingredient in Suboxone (Naloxone) and he noticed that they responded better to Subutex. I can say that while I still have some constipation and at times low sex drive_ they haved dramatically decreased in severity. My cycle is also back to normal. Extra additives in ANY medication is something that the body just doesn't need. The Naloxone only acts as a blocker for opiates. If you prove to your doctor that you are responsible and are not abusing opiates (or_ even trying to abuse the Suboxone) they should consider giving you Subutex instead. And it's cheaper! If you are a woman taking Suboxone and having any of the problems I had_ please consider taking Subutex. You will still have some issues_ but they will be less severe_ I promise. Who knows_ it may be better for men too_ but of course I can't attest to that! Feel free to email with any questions.,F,34,12  months4mg 3X D,8/20/2011Email,Subutex
12, 4, Treatment Resistant Depression,"Refractory/Treatment Resistant Depression/Anxiety since the age of 16y/o and have tried probably 70 psychotherpeutic drugs (all classes of antidepressants_ benzo's_ mood stablizers_ 70 ECT'e or shock treatments_ you name it_ I've tried it.  Parnate and Naridil with ""Buprenorphine even better.",Maybe many people suffering from severe life altering anxiety and depression don't necessarily have a defective monamine or neurotransmitter malfunction of serotonin_ norepinepine_ dopamine and Gaba_ but in endorphins or opiods as exercise was the only thing that ever really superiorly helped my depression via endorphin system.,M,43,2  months2 mg BID 2X D,9/27/2010,Subutex
