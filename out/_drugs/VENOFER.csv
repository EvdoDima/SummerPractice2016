While it infused_ my exhaled breath smelled/tasted like maple syrup.,I went through two 5-visit IV treatments_each over 5 weeks_ each with two vials of Venofer injected into a small bag of saline. It boosted my iron to better levels and made my epogen treatment more effective.,M,23,10  weeks,12/4/2008,Venofer
