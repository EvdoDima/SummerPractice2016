1, 2, for severe cystic acne,Severe depression_ constant migraines_ nausea_ fatigue_ anxiety_ chest pains_ dizziness_ short-term memory loss_ palpitations_ dry eyes.,Usually I don?t have serious problems with most generics of Mircette.  Viorele has the worst side effects in a birth control pill I've ever experienced.  I wasn't able to function.  On the positive note_ it kept my skin clear and my pores tight.  My husband said I look younger and less tired.  Usually I have red eyes from birth control pill use but this did not make my eyes red_ although it did made them dry.  I wasn?t able to wear my contacts for a long time.,F,37,10  days 1X D,2/25/2015,Viorele
