0, 4, Gerd_ Barrett's,Quite a bit of abdominal gas in the early morning after taking it before bed.,I also take 40 mg of Nexium first thing in the morning.  Between the two_ I've not felt better in years.,M,75,2  months30 mg 1X D,3/8/2016,Zegerid otc
1, 5, Acid Reflux Disease/GERD,No side effects at all.  OTC pill hard to swallow due to its large size.,This medication is a miracle medication for me.  I have tried every prescription and non-prescription medication for acid reflux_ and this is the only one that does anything.  I take it 30 minutes before every meal.  The presciption powdered form did work better_ but I don't mind the lesser amount of money for the OTC version.  If you get a lump in your throat from acid reflux - this medication will be your salvation!,F,38,4  years40mg 2X D,1/2/2011,Zegerid otc
