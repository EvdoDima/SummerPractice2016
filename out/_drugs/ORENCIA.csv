0, 2, Rheumatoid arthritis,Extreme fatigue and hippy tummy,Has made zero difference to my arthritis,F,63,3  days30,2/3/2016,Orencia
1, 5, RA,none,I was on Orencia for about 7 or 8 years.  It stopped the progress of the disease and eliminated all swelling. It even reduced the inflammation I have from osteoarthritis/injuries in my hands and I regained a respectable amount of grip strength. Unfortunately_ Dr. went back to his home country.  Haven't had Orencia for 6 months now and I feel 10 years older and every part of my body that has ever ached is hurting. In other words it relieved OR inflammation as well as the RA.  Looking for another rheumatologist that will prescribe Orencia for me!,M,75,7  days 1X M,5/7/2015,Orencia
2, 1, My wife - for arithitis,My wife died on the way home from having _ infusion of orencia. she complained about the infusion_ and died 15 min. later_ on her way home. that was 3-years ago,I notice that it is no longer advertised on T.V. I lost my wife for nothing. Richard C. Walton _Sr. Tele ; 352-621-9715,M,73,1  days 1X D,2/24/2015,Orencia
3, 4, RA,No side effects except for some tiredness. At month 2 it felt like I was lifted from a fog_ I no longer feel as if I was hit by a bus. My RA pain is now very localized and improving everyday.,It took several months to start working_  but it is worth it!One day_ you just feel better_ like you did before RAattacked your body.,F,54,3  months 1X M,1/28/2015,Orencia
4, 2, RA and psoriasis,Headache_ sore throat and back pain and tenderness near both kidneys for 1-2 days after subcutaneous injection.,I have not benefitted much in terms of relief from swollen joints or stiffness. Hands_ knees_ feet still painful around joints. I was told to give it time but not impressed so far. Began taking methotrexate ( (6) 2.5 mg tabs_ 1X per week) during second month but no improvement noted.,F,55,3  months125 mg 1X W,9/28/2014Email,Orencia
5, 5, RA,After using Remicade and Humira I have been on Orencia for 4 years. The doctors are using it to control pulmonary fibrosis and rheumatoid lung in my case. No bad side effects. The Orencia reduces the inflammation in my lungs and allows me to breathe so much easier. I am having the infusion every 21 days at this time.,Humira and now Orencia has stopped the progression of the scarring in my lungs. I now have only 20% working but after an infusion I can do most things without getting short of breath if I'm careful. This stuff saved my life!,M,64,4  yearsMaximum 1X AN,8/27/2014Email,Orencia
6, 1, psoriatic arthritis,Started with just mild fatigue_ and nausea the first week. By week 3_ felt like I had a bad case of the flu_ minus respiratory symptoms. Severe nausea_ loss of appetite_ and severe diarrhea. I felt like I was hypoglycemic all the time! To top it off_ I got no relief from the psoriatic arthritis at all! Would never take this drug again!!!! Oh by the way_ I'm an RN!,,M,61,3  weeks125 mg,8/2/2014Email,Orencia
7, 1, RA,None.  No help for RA_ and no known side effects.  My original comment was the second listing [above] for this drug.,Waste of money and time.  Since I had read the time to be effective might be stretched out_ I went the 5 months.,M,83,5  monthsIM-self 1X W,2/21/2014Email,Orencia
8, 3, RA,Anxiety_ depression_ horrible smelling urine_ heightened sensory reactions (hearing things/ seeing things out of corner of eyes)_ breathing_  severe heart burn and digestive issues.,I get it as an IV. The side effects come and go_ they are not constant but they are bad when they occur. Had some of the same problems with enbrel. Was on methotrexate at same time_ but stopped taking that two weeks ago to see if it would lessen the side effects_ and also to see if the Orencia is working on its own. Still have minor arthritic flares even on the medications.,F,43,8  months750 mg 1X M,2/10/2014,Orencia
9, 3, RA,Can't tell yet.  Enbrel worked for 4+ years_ then 2 years ago_ stopped.  Been through most other biologics and can't do MTX.I understand Orencia takes 4 months for some_ and I hope it will kick in for me_ hence the 3 rating for now.,I will revisit as I determine it is or is not working.  As of 7 weeks no negatives_ but no symptom relief either.,M,83,7  weeks1 IM shot 1X W,10/1/2013Email,Orencia
10, 5, Rheumatoid arthritis,No side effects. Hed to increase dosage to eliminate any flare ups between treatments. I do not take methotrexate with it. Was on humira but was not as effective,,F,46,9  months 1X M,1/9/2012,Orencia
11, 3, PsA,Dull heavy headache. Flares up to painful sometimes.,I took Enbrel for 3 1/2 years and it stopped working. I am waiting for the Orencia to kick in. I'd like to see more ratings from people with Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.,F,56,3  months750mg. 1X M,2/14/2011,Orencia
12, 5, RA,for the first few days after the IV_ flu-like symptoms_ back pain specially in the kidney area_neck pain_ jitteriness_ odd smelling urine,This drug worked so slowly that I did not notice it working at first_ but it seems to be working great now_ if I can make it through the first few days after the infusion. I have been on Enbrel_ but it stopped working after about 3 years_ Humira did not work at all. I also take mtx_ but am considering stopping it because of the side effects. I am very happy with the Orencia so far.,F,58,5  months1000 1X M,2/5/2011Email,Orencia
13, 2, RA,migraines,All drugs are poisonous eventually; I have found a cure with the honey and vinegar diet (which also cures migraines) and vitamins!,M,55,30  days 1X D,12/6/2010Email,Orencia
14, 5, rheumatoid arthritis,none,This drug has been a blessing for me.  Humira and Enbrel helped very little_ plus I had terrible injections site reactions.  The sites would swell up_ turn red and itch like crazy for several days.  I still take Methotrexate also.  My RA is pretty well controlled at this point.  It took about three months to get the full effect of the drug.,F,53,3  years,12/14/2009,Orencia
15, 5, rheumatoid arthritis,Some redness and bruising at injection site. Usually tired and achy for first 24 hours. No problem after this.,I had tried Humera_ Embril_ methotrexate_ nothing was helping. Orencia has been great. My doctor told me to be patient_ that it would take 4-6 months to help. It took 4 month and I really started noticing a difference. My doctor said my joints are the best she ever seen them look to date. I feel more energetic and my pain is reduces to about two thirds of what it was.,F,45,7  months,12/9/2009,Orencia
16, 1, RA,Terrible Migraine That WOULD NOT go away.,It started minutes after starting the IV and grew worse through out the day. After my second infusion my headache was so bad I went to the ER and they couldn't find anything wrong. They gave me major pain killers but nothing worked. I stopped taking the meds and it took about 2 months for the pain to go away. I would NEVER take this drug EVER again.,F,21,2  months,12/9/2009Email,Orencia
17, 3, rheumatoid arthritis,Some redness at the IV site after administration. Otherwise_ well tolerated.,It's a bit bothersome to have an IV medication-- just because of the time factor_ IV_ etc. If you can_ have the infusion at a private office.  I've had the infusions in a hospital outpatient center_ and each infusion takes about 1 1/2 hours because it takes an hour for the medication to come from the hospital pharmacy.  BE SURE to go to the Orencia website--- www.orencia.com to sign up for the promise program before your FIRST infusion and they will pay your co-pays for the first few months. You can find the infusion schedule on that website also. I have been on several other medications Humira_ plaquenil_ Arava and have not had success in controlling my RA with them. I can't tell much difference yet however with the orencia.,F,32,1  months,7/19/2009,Orencia
