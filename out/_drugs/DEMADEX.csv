0, 3, congestive heart failure,I have only been on this drug for one day_ although the dr has tried lasix for the past 3 weeks with no results she put me on this yesterday. I feel better_no chest pain_ BUT I GAINED 2 pounds over night and was awake ALL NIGHT! I am still short of breathe_ but that is nothing new. So I can't blame it on this medication.,,F,61,1  days30 1X D,10/3/2014Email,Demadex
1, 1, Edema/fluid retention,These pills caused paralysis in less than 12 hours after I took the first (and only) one.  Woke up and could not move my hands.  They were locked in fists.  My speech was slurred and my facial muscles were also locked.  I could barely walk.  I had to be transported to the ER via ambulance where I received a potassium IV.  These pills had depleted my potassium level to 2.5.  I had another attack of paralysis in the ER.  Do not take these pills unless your doctor has checked your potassium levels before prescribing.  Mine did not and this was the most terrifying experience of my life.  I will never_ ever take these again.,,F,29,1  days20 mg,2/13/2013,Demadex
