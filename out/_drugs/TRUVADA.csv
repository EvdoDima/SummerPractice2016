1, 1, HIV,Osteoporosis. Men in their 20's get osteoporosis from this poison_ too! After all these years they are finally acknowledging this fact. It will cripple you!,Severe Osteo ain't just for old ladies anymore! HIV meds are just plain toxic and I quit all those meds due to side effects after being tortured into my current physical helplessness since 1996. The pharm. corps are just plain greedy and evil. I wish I never took this drug even if you believe it means I would be dead now. This is not a life_ and truvada/viread just give you more problems that never go away.,F,57,10  years 1X O,9/8/2012,Truvada
