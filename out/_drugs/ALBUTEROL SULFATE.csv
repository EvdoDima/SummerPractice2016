2, 2, Albuterol Sulfate Inhaler - TEVA,RED REPLACEMENT MINI LOOKING inhaler. Replacing the old ones. did not stop asthma attack in progress. Wasteful priming of the inhaler before use_ after taste.,Red inhaler made by Teva. Did not seem to stop the attack without excess use. It tells you to prime the inhaler before use which wastes doses. Left a gross after taste. Half the size of the other inhalers with a double the price tag on it. Not impressed. Helps some.,F,35,2  years,4/17/2009,Albuterol sulfate
3, 1, Asthma,I now take ProAir HFA_ since the old generic albuterol is no longer available.  No side effects_ but I fear death because the ProAir HFA just DOES NOT WORK to stop an asthma attack.,I used generic albuterol for over 10 years as needed for asthma attacks.  The old albuterol WORKED great_ but the FDA & EPA had a problem with the propellant in it_ so now we have ProAir_ which costs more_ but does not work.  Instead of 2-4 puffs during an attack_ I have to take 8-10 puffs of ProAir.  I don't know if they have changed the drug or just the propellant_ but as it is today_ the ProAir is a waste of money.,F,46,3  months,4/11/2009,Albuterol sulfate
