Insomnia.,Within the first two or three days_ the muscles in the top part of both of my thighs started hurting continuously. From the knee to the groin. Very bad pain.

Plus my sleep cycle suddenly changed. I though that might be because of the unrelenting pain_ but now I'm not so sure. I stopped taking it one day shy of the two week mark my Doctor prescribed.

The side effects have been so horrible and the UTI pain still exists so I discontinued med.  Should know tomorrow results of recheck culture but expect it to be positive due to continued burning.  Doctor said he already alerted Infectious Disease dept immediately after first culture to prepare for possible IV treatments.  This drug was only a hit or miss antibiotic for this strain of E Coli bacteria.  (Note:  mfg is Sandoz_ 875/125_ 2 x daily),,F,48,8  days875/125,1/9/2013Email,Augmentin xr

Thankfully my sister also has started taking this medication and is experiencing the same side effects.  And funny enough after 4 days of stopping Augmentin_ my anxiety has gone.  Knowing that Zoloft takes 2 - 3 weeks to work_ I am fully convinced that it was the Augmentin that made me feel the worst anxiety in my life.  I also had Diarrhea and no appetite whatsoever.  Never in my life have I suffered from such appetite suppression as I have on this medication.
