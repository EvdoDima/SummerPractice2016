1, 4, Depression,Wellbutrin/ bupropion is a great solution for depression.  Not many side effects until my pharmacy changes generic suppliers.  Over the years the pharmacy just changes suppliers_ and with that my life changes dramatically.    In 2012 I was switched to the Generic  bupropion by Teva.  I felt horrible_   I don't think there was any active drug in the pills.  2 years later studies proved Teva had manufacturing problems and it was taken off the market.  Now_  I was switched to Sun Phama  Generic_  100 mg  SR.  I've been taking 4 days and feel horrible.  Like my life is flushing down the toilet. I'm just numb and very spacey_  I don't think there is any active Bupropion in the Sun Pharma pills.  I'm going through withdrawal after 12 years on the medicine.  Never again will I accept the pharmcies Sun pharma pills.  I'm switching pharmacies and will always verify who makes the generic before I accept the RX.  I wish I could afford the name brand Wellbutrin.   I usually feel great  on the Sand,,M,55,12  years200mg 1X D,2/21/2016Email,Bupropion hydrochloride

4, 1, Depression/Anxiety,Anxiety_ binge eating_ racing toughts.,After being on the brand name Wellbutrin XL for 3 years I decided to change to the generic.  Slowly over the course of that month I had extreme anxiety return_ depression and wild binge eating issues.  I did not realize that the generic would be so different but it was....argh!  I will never go back to generic for any of my anxiety/depression related symptoms.  The money is worth it.,F,40,30  days300 mg 1X D,10/5/2011,Bupropion hydrochloride
5, 3, fatigue_ anxiety,Severe abdominal cramping and bloating_ constipation_ lack of appetite_ and teeth sensitivity.,,F,23,2  weeks150 mg 1X D,7/20/2011Email,Bupropion hydrochloride
6, 4, Depression_ SAD,Agitation_ weight loss_ dry mouth_ constipation_ headaches_ insomnia (at first)_ decreased appetite,Felt awesome for the first few days_ then was depressed/agitated for two weeks. It really started to kick in a month later and the effects were subtle. I have to say that this medicine made me very very habitual all of a sudden. I was eating *perfectly* as religiously reading food labels and never eating anything unhealthy. I started all sorts of good habits on a daily basis_ and I think this can help people get out of depression as long as it doesn't turn into OCD. I had cotton mouth for the first couple weeks_ and for the whole rest of the time I had to carry a water bottle everywhere I went. I was also severely constipated_ and even with those magnesium drinks that are supposed to empty you out within minutes didn't do anything. It got easier with time_ but then the effects started dying out and it was like I was taking nothing (maybe six months?) I had to increase my dose to 450mg total...it helped_ but I think I just became more agitated. I think this medicine is only made for short term so you can build healthy habits. One more thing -- whenever I drank alcohol_ even just one drink_ it would make me extremely tired and quiet. I wouldn't get any sense of well being or sociability at all. If I drank two drinks then I would be really depressed for 2-3 days. Couldn't feel alcohol until I fully came off.,F,22,10  months150mg 2X D,6/20/2011Email,Bupropion hydrochloride
7, 3, depression_ anxiety,Significant and ongoing abdominal bloating and frequent cramping.,I haven't been on it long enough to realize the benefits in full but I've noticed increased energy levels and being more focused on tasks both of which I like but the abdominal bloating and cramps are too inconvenient for me.,F,43,3  weeks150mg 1X D,3/3/2011,Bupropion hydrochloride
8, 4, depression,decreased libido,This drug was given to me as a generic for Welbutrin xl and I don't notice any difference between the two. It works and has the least amount of side effects of the many other ssri's I have tried.,M,61,3  years150 1X D,8/13/2010,Bupropion hydrochloride
9, 4, Depression_ Anxiety,Insomnia.  Only get about 4-6 hours sleep a night_ but it does not seem to affect my performance during the day.,Now I just have insomnia.
