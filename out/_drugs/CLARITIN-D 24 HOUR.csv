1, 3, Stuffy sinuses_ sore throat,Jittery_ faster heartbeat,Didn't work until about four hours in_ so definitely not impressed with that. When it did work_ my nose still dripped but I didn't feel stuffy_ so I tolerated it. My throat was still a bit sore_ but I attribute that to the nasal drip which the Claritin-D did not do anything for. About six hours in I started to feel a bit jittery and my heart rate went up. I wasn't panicking about that_ even though I have anxiety (thank god I found this and could easily diagnose the cause of my jitteriness) but it wasn't very pleasant. I won't use this again; I'll probably just opt for some good ole nose spray next time my allergies decide to attack.,F,16,1  days10 1X D,6/26/2016,Claritin-d 24 hour

3, 1, Plugged ears_ mucus_ stuffy sinuses,I've taken this before over the past few years to help with allergies and I've always been fine. But this time was horrible. I couldn't sleep all night_ my heart was racing_ I felt nervous even though I knew it was from the medication. Now I've got a headache. I won't be taking it again!,,F,30,1  days,4/28/2016,Claritin-d 24 hour
4, 4, Allergies Hayfever,Now_ some insomnia if taken right before bed and after 3-5 hours of sleep. This wasn't the case initially.Sometimes the feeling of a small mucus lump in the back of my throat.,I've actually been taking the Costco generic (Allerclear) as it is much cheaper than Claritin D24.I only take it for 4-5 months in the spring and summer for hayfever. For the first couple of years I would take it at night and wake up feeling very well-rested unlike other allergy meds where I would have a very difficult time waking up.After using for a couple of years I would begin waking up after 3-5 hours of sleep and not be able to get back to sleep. Now_ I take it in the morning.It doesn't get rid of all of my hayfever symptoms but it does help quite a bit.I wish it wasn't as controlled so we could get several boxes at a time.,M,48,7  years1 pill 1X D,4/10/2016,Claritin-d 24 hour

I felt less side effects. I have a history of anxiety attacks and this lil pill was testing my limits.

8, 1, dust and pollen allergies,I first started taking this drug at Coachella in April where I experienced the worst allergies I had ever had. I could not breath and my eyes were swollen and crusted shut. Within a hour of taking the drug_ I felt immediate relief. My eye bags drained out and I began to breath. But I also felt hyper_ anxious_ and energized_ as if I had just drank a ton of caffeine. My eyes widened and I had a dry mouth. I also had a loss of appetite. The side effects came over me in waves- I would literally feel a rush of good and energizing feelings_ also slight nausea and dizziness_ come over me at various points of the day- like taking Molly. It's strong_ strong stuff. Later_ I experienced insomnia_ but I would try to take the 12 hr drug early in the morning so I wouldn't feel the effects by night time. I must admit that at first I loved the way this drug made me feel. I would get so much done_ as if I had taken an adderal_ and feel so alert and awake_ plus never had to deal with my allergy symp,"However_ I started feeling more insomnia and started having some anxiety attacks. I have had depression and anxiety before and can recognize the symptoms immediately. I felt down and ""weird"". I'd pace around my apartment feeling terrible and anxious and just cry. My dry eyes twitched. And when I would come down from the drug_ at night_ I would feel even more exhausted and hungry than normal. I became really dependent_ addicted- fearful if I did not take it I would not get as much done the next day_ or I would just feel to tired and not be able to breath_ so I needed more....I'd take an extra pill (12 hr) to go out at night to stay awake. I seem to have gotten used to the drug in some respects- It no longer gives me a jolt_ and I no longer feel good at all while I take it. Instead I am exhausted. I feel waves of exhaustion that just come over me. I feel like I am asleep but the drug is pulling my eyelids awake (and they twitch still). I feel depressed. I have been on the same birth control for years. But I think this pill does something to exasperate my hormones or my PMS symptoms. For the past 3 months being on Claritin_ my breasts have swollen up so large and been so painful during my ovulation until my period is over. It is so uncomfortable that I cannot even exercise. I have also been constantly constipated and bloated. I retain water. I have been exercising and eating healthy as always_ even overcompensating and eating less_ and I've still gained 5 pound",F,25,3  months 1X D,8/6/2015Email,Claritin-d 24 hour

I took it once and was up all night long_ feeling as if my heart was going to explode_ restlessness_ jitters_ headache_ hot sweats_ dry mouth.

28, 1, Allergies,I took Claritin-D for my allergies then ten minutes later I had a huge headache that wouldn't go away so I decided to take aspirin. Now I had done some research before_ if both shouldn't be taken together. There wasn't any big threats so I thought it'd be ok. Now within 30 minutes_ let me tell you how fast my heart was beating. It was literally pounding out of my chest. I already have really bad anxiety attacks_ so low and behold... my mind starts panicking and I'm on the floor feeling like my heart is going to just pop out. I'm not sure if both of the medicine made it worse? but I have taken Claritin-D before_ and it has given me the same symptoms as I had today. It was just 10 times worse today. I felt like my head was floating all day_ very dazed_ every time I stood up I would fall back down from being so light-headed_ had negative energy to do even the most simplest things. I just slept for a few hours and I still feel sick to my stomach. I hope this wears off soon................,Never taking again.,F,24, 1 1X D,5/31/2013,Claritin-d 24 hour

32, 5, Seasonal Allergies,Constant dry mouth_ occasional heart palpitations_ occasional insomnia_ occasional ED,I LOVE this stuff.  I used to live in a constant congested_ foggy state during May-Sept allergy season.  Would get debilitating sinus headaches especially if I drank any alcohol.  But now I take the 24 hour Claritin-D every day and feel great.  You MUST drink a lot of water EVERY DAY.  And I give up coffee once I go on the allergy meds or I get heart palpitations.  But it works so well for me that I got a prescription from my family physician so I can get 3 months worth at a time.  Yes_ there are side effects_ but for me_ they are FAR better than the allergies!,M,51,6  years 1X D,4/15/2013,Claritin-d 24 hour
33, 3, Itchy eyes_ nose_ and throat.,Claritin worked great for my allergies. I was in love with it until I started experiencing other unnatural woman problems. I could finally go a day without being miserable from allergies_ but my sex life was on 0 for an entire week. This isn't like me and my bf was kind of concerned as well as myself. I was just having vaginal dryness_ which made anything sexual unpleasing. I thought it was a coincidence_ but then I found that a few other women were experiencing the same problems! If you are a woman without a sex life_ I'd recommend claritin any day. Maybe it's my fault for not drinking enough water while on this medication_ but either way_ it's my only complaint.,,F,20,3  weeks10 mg,2/16/2013Email,Claritin-d 24 hour

It also did wonders for my allergies?I could finally breathe. After 3 wks of being on it though_ all the negative side effects hit. The deal breaker was the plummet in libido.

I took my first claritin the other day as I have been really stuffed up in the mornings due to possible allergies. I took the first one at about 5pm and then went to my jiu jitsu class at 6:30pm. Best class I've had in a long time - I was energetic_ excited and basically high. I couldn't sleep very well that night_ was restless and unable to deeply sleep which is highly unusual for me.

43, 1, year-round allergies,It works SO well for allergies_ and I enjoyed it as an appetite suppressant. But I finally realized that it's been responsible for painful vaginal dryness (sex was almost impossible_ even using tampons was unpleasant)_ really bad mood swings and irritability (especially during PMS time_ which has never been a problem for me before)_ lower libido_ and a drastic decrease in athletic ability/performance (it's like I suddenly had no cardio conditioning or muscle strength despite working out intensely my entire life). Now that I've stopped taking it for a couple weeks_ these things are beginning to subside_ but now I'm horribly exhausted all day every day. I'm trying to compensate with caffeine_ but it's not really working (and I don't want to be addicted to that either!) So now I'm perpetually tired and suffering really bad allergy symptoms.

The biggie_ though_ was that after I stopped it_ my nose became so dry and caked with mucus that I have had to wet it and blow hard_ one nostril at a time_ into the sink several times a day.

55, 3, Flu/Cold Congestion,Extreme Bloody Nose,My very first time taking this stuff resulted in a pretty severe bloody nose. About two hours after_ I felt EXTREME pressure building up in my sinuses... and then it suddenly dissolved (more like 'popped')_ but that's when a huge gush of blood poured out of my nose and all over my shirt (I had absolutely no advanced warning or time to grab the tissues). A few minutes after that_ a giant bloody sack came out after that and the bleeding stopped. I swear it was the lining of my sinuses. I know it was from the Claritin because I hadn't had a bloody nose since I was 8 years old.All of that said_ it DID clear up the congestion. I think perhaps I had this reaction because both of my second molar's roots protrude deeply into my sinus cavity_ so if you also have that going on you might experience the same thing. Therefore_ I'd advise everyone to only take this when you absolutely cannot stand the congestion anymore... and to keep plenty of tissues handy_ just in case.,F,21,1  days10mg 1X D,6/25/2011,Claritin-d 24 hour

My heart pounded out of my chest and I felt as if I had taken a diet pill or some similar stimulant.  By nighttime my heart was still racing and it took my forever to fall asleep.

But my biggest complaint is that my store never has 12 hour only 24 hour and the drug DOES NOT last 24 hours_ it's absolute rubbish!  And to make it worse... You can't take anything else until 24 hours later...
