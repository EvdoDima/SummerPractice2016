Plus many othe health issues that had no explanation.,Horrible rash on chest. Appears and feels like a chemical burn_ at times I have had blisters and chest/neck area are always discolored. Also have many skin tags appear on neck/chest area that sting & burn. I have multiple strange health issues that can't be explained after test results Fail to find a cause. For example: muscle spasms on left side rib cage_ leg & foot cramps_ neuropathy in toes_ hand/thumb pain_ cluster headaches_ can not focus eyes well enough to read after waking_ for about an hour. Tired_ no energy_ hot all the time_ sweat all the time_ back pain_ joint pain_ foggy head_ can't recall words_ anxiety_ impatient_ frustrated_ easily to anger. I have taken myself off of this drug_ (not recommending this_ just my personal choice) I want to have evidence that some of these symptoms diminish when the drug is out of my system. It has only been 3 days and I am seeing some improvement. Glad I found these comments; I have several doctors_ allergist_ dermatologist_ GP_ gastro_ GYN. and the list goes on.

49, 2, HBP,Diovan immediately dropped my blood pressure.It works on me within 20 minutes. I have been taking it over 10 years.I immediately started losing my hair. I had a tremendous amount if hair or I would be totally bald by now. I have had dark circles under my eyes that I have to use concealer on. I have also been heat intolerant.  If I cannot get somewhere cool I will start getting dizzy and feel like I will pass out.I gained 10 pounds and have not been able to lose it in all this time. After reading just a few of the personal side effects from others I realized my side effects are not as bad as some. However I decided to go off this medication two months ago. I weaned off by gradually decreasing the tablets. NEVER go off this medication Cold Turkey!! Just wean off!! Everything I have read indicates going on a vegetarian lifestyle (at least temporarily) dramatically decrease the blood pressure. There are herbs that will help the heart and blood pressure.

59, 1, Hypertension,I see all the side effects people have commented about and I have many of the same issues. I'm not absolutely positive that it is caused by diovan but after seeing this I'm 85% sure that it's a real possibility. I feel there isn't much use to talk with my doctor right away until I can prove it because I'm certain I will hear its not the medication and why after all this time has it taken so long to have these symptoms. There (not recommended) I'm going to stop the diovan for now and see if the side effects dissipate. I will control my blood pressure naturally for now doing my best. Anything is better than what is happening to me now for the last few years. The issues I've been experiencing are extreme neuropathy with foot pain to the point I can't wear socks and shoes without having severe pain wich lingers on throughout the whole night after a short period of wearing then and some walking_ eye/vision issues. The most important of any and there are a couple more is the neuropathy. The pain never goes away in my feet_ toes especially_ its there 24/7 and have alotbof trouble walking (i use a cane) and when I do walk it's not far at all. They had much difficulty giving me a diagnosis of pheriphial neuropathy because there was no good reason for me to have it.Therefore another reason for me to believe the diovan is the cause. Excuse how long this is but there is so much more I could say about this. This is the worst most devestating thing I've ever physically experienced and I',,F,51,5  years80 MG,8/8/2014Email,Diovan
