0, 5, Anxiety due to alcohol and cocaine,Side effects were minor or almost non existant. It's when you try to stop taking this benzodiazepine that the real problem begins_ because your CNS depends on it_ in order to function.,Take Ativan only for a short period of time if necesarry. It is a drug (OPIOID) just like what you find on the streets_ only legal because it is prescribed by a Dr. Don't let any Dr. tell you that this is a maintenance drug for you_ it is not. It is a powerful drug that start at low doses and your body and mind want more..this is why it is a controlled substance. SHORT TERM USE 7 DAYS MAX AND YOU SHOULD BE OK...SAY NO TO BENZOS!!!,M,44,1  years2 mg a day,8/12/2016Email,Ativan

4, 5, Anxiety,None other then the physiological urge to take the Ativan.,Due to some health issues_ I was having a high level of anxiety daily which also led to some depression. Ativan was fast acting and helped calm me down when the anxiety felt unbearable. It did not really help me sleep. I started taking Melatonin for sleep and then I was able to stop taking the Ativan. I'm glad I never started taking the antidepressants the doctors had prescribed.,M,62,2  months.5mg 1X D,6/6/2016,Ativan

I'm working part time again.,The only problem that I have ran into has been my regular Pharmacy all of a sudden decided they would not fill the prescription even after calling the  psychiatrist.

7, 5, Panic attack,"I experienced panic attacks severe at about 30. Worked very well. I am now 68. So I have taken this med for over 35 years. I have over 500 scuba dives_ jumped out of air planes_ made over 200 speeches and worked on ambulance for two years. No side effects at all. I take 1 mg x day. The only problem is getting off fast. I was on 3 Mg a day now 1 mg. it caused my heart to skip withdrawing.  My cardio Doc said ""why quit"".  Really. I have probably been on this med as long as anyone. No ill effects. It does have a bad effect I have seen in about 1 in 10 people I know. They became very agitated. Also I don't use this for sleep. I have no other illness and take no other meds.  If you can't sleep try over the counter Unisom. This is an over the counter med and works very well. Give it a chance.",,M,68,10  years2,4/19/2016Email,Ativan

10, 1, Insomnia,For several years Ativan worked well in helping me get to sleep (2mg)_ then getting me back to sleep when I woke up at 4 am.(1mg)_ until I went into tolerance withdrawal_ a truly hellish experience. Have not been able to sleep more than a few hours each night_ and now have debilitating anxiety attacks during the day. Each morning I wake up on the Cortisol Express and cannot calm down. Only higher doses can stop it_ and now that I'm trying to taper off this terrible drug_ the withdrawal has been horrific_ with worse insomnia and panic than what caused me to take it in the first place.,Don't even start benzodiazepines_ because getting off them is worse than anyone could possibly imagine. Once you develop tolerance withdrawal it will be too late to prevent this hell.,F,60,4  years3 mg,4/2/2016,Ativan

It has been over 24 hrs since I took the 1 mg dose and I am still dizzy and light headed.

16, 5, PTSD/ constant anxiety& panic attac,Dont feel like myself. No desire to eat_now i just want to barrel through work_ go straight home and hide under my covers in bed. (which is impossible. I have two small children) Although i get relief from the discomfort of constant severe anxiety_ im now terrified being without my meds. Ive ran out 3 times thinking i could be fine. WRONG. the withdrawls are worse than the anxiety and are far more severe. I become dizzy_ weakness in arms and legs_ tunnel vision_ panic attacks that last longer and are HELL_ cant sleep because of anxiety_ vivid crazy nightmares! I get more anxiety when im running low because i dread what happens when i run out. Because im waiting for my insurance plan to freaking start_ i've been to the ER three times for refills this last month 1/2!  I never imagined i could be this dependant on medication. The E.R sure likes to send you home with them then expect you to just_ BAM! stop taking them knowing how addictive they are_ then they question you about why you're back for a refill. It makes no sense! Hello! Yes_ im back because i think im dying and ativan is what takes the horrible withdrawls away. Duh! WELL I GUESS I AM AN ADDICT THEN. I need Ativan to literally function and go to work now. Benzo's are the worst to ween off of. And stopping cold turkey could cause seizures.,,F,31,2  months2 mg daily,1/17/2016,Ativan

I've been on EVERYTHING for my panic disorder... all the SSRIs_ Effexor_ trileptal_ gabapentin_ buspar_ propranolol_ lamictal_ betaxtol_ prazosin with no luck but this medication works. No side effects except some sleepiness. When I took Ativan it was the most normal I'd felt in a long time_ and it lasts for a good 8-12 hours too. I was only given it for exams though_ and as if now I'm stuck with buspar again which does nothing for me but make me sick to my stomach. My doctor refuses to give to me again because of the risk of addiction_ but I've tried everything else and some of the other meds he's put me on have had some dangerous side effects that have almost killed me.

29, 3, Severe Anxiety,Ativan worked great until I became addicted to it. I lost 2 years of my life to this drug. I can't even recall most of that 2 year period. I really needed to go to rehab but my husband along with my dr supervised my weaning off of it. Even weaning off was HORRIBLE. Worst anxiety that lasted a LONG A TIME. Even worse than what I EVER experienced before I took it.,Please do NOT let your doctor prescribe this to you on a long term basis.

Ativan helped me through a really tough emotional time when I felt like I couldn't take on basic day to day tasks like showering. 30 mins after taking I was calm and able to focus on work like a normal person. Only downside is that it is addictive otherwise I would take it everyday for as long as I needed. So so helpful.,F,29,4  weeks 1X D,9/9/2015,Ativan

32, 4, Anxiety,None,Ativan is great to help with anxiety but I can't say it enough.....don't take it for long periods of time!! I was on it for 2 years when I found out I was pregnant they made me stop taking it immediately and the withdrawal was terrible. I swore I would never take it again but my anxiety got the best of me_ I tried weaning off of it recently and the anxiety was HORRIBLE so I started taking my normal dosage again. I will prob be on this medication for the rest of my life_ please do yourself a favor and don't take it daily (as my doctor prescribed) it is very addictive and very hard to get off of.

36, 1, Anxiety due to health issue,Initially helped but this was very short lived. Blacked out trying to get off this-was not told how addicting it was. Literally the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life and it lasted months. Had to switch to Klonopin in order to wean off benzos. I would never take this again.

After slowly removing myself off the drug with a gradual decrease of a period of 4weeks mentally I feel fine_physically not so much. I have been getting abdominal cramps and given that I already have issues with my stomach it adds to it. When I thought back when I first started taking it I remembered my bowel movements started to increase significantly_ now being off the drug I notice they have decreased quite a bit.

I was with a customer at lunch and blacked out an had seizures. Was taken to ER where they gave me Ativan and everything was fine. Obviously I was addicted but had NO clue until that day. It took me months to get ""off"" this drug with the help of the Ashton manual and a forum which has since been closed. This experience was one of the worst of my life but I'm one of the lucky ones.",I kicked my doctor prescribed addiction several years ago. I follow this web site occasionally to see how others are faring. I believe this drug class_ including Ativan_ Xanax_ Valium and so on is one of the most serious drug problems in America (and maybe the world). These drugs are being prescribed to millions of people_ many of whom have very bad experiences as they build tolerance and become addicted. Do a Google search and read the stories for yourself. MANY lives have been devastated by this drug and others.

42, 4, stress,Getting agitated day after I take a dose.,I  take Ativan 1mg. maybe once a week_ maybe 2 times in a week.  I was prescribed it for stress_ but I found it to be great in the evening to help me ease in to a nice sleep_ which is has.   I was taking Ambien prior_ but found the ativan much more pleasant to take than Ambien..   The issue I'm having with this drug is that I have noticed a pattern whereby_ the very next day after taking the drug the night before_ I get agitated_ and I end up provoking an absolute fight with my husband on things I wouldn't ordinarily even pay attention to.  It happens every time.  I wonder if anyone else has had this experience.  It makes me afraid to take ativan at night knowing I'm going to be irritable the next day.  Otherwise_ I love this drug for sleep.  I would never take this drug every day_ and certainly never take more than 1mg.  Is this a side effect other people have experienced?,F,54,2  months1 1X W,3/25/2015,Ativan
43, 1, For anxiety,Shakes_ muscle aches_ insomnia_ nauseousness_ extreme anxiety_ depression_ buzzing in my ears_ heart palps_ shortness of breath.,I would not recommend taking this drug. I was on .5mg for only 2 weeks for my anxiety attacks. Yes_ it worked at night so I could sleep peacefully_ but once I stopped taking it_ the withdrawals began horrifically and that's just from 2 WEEKS!!! I wish my doctor never would have prescribed this to me. She did tell me that it was highly addictive and for that reason she was just going to give me enough for a couple weeks to calm my nerves. She did not explain to me what could happen to you if you just stop taking it cold turkey. I understand that everybody is different and some may not even experience withdrawals from ativan only after a few weeks_ but like I said... everybody is different and she still should have explained to me what could happen. My body reacted very badly to this drug. I'm now just starting to feel a little better. The last few days were excruciating for me. The anxiety attacks came on so intense. I could not sit still from the shakes_ I constantly felt nauseous_ I was having digestive problems_ I could not sleep at all! I was awake for 24 hours and being awake that long is just going to feed into your anxiety. I was so restless_ I had absolutely no appetite. If I even tried to put food to my mouth_ I felt like I was automatically going to vomit. I had a racing heart_ and I cried uncontrollably_ I also had buzzing in my ears. My muscles started to ache so bad from constantly shaking and being so tense. The worst part was definitely the anxiety that came on,F,25,2  weeks.5 mg,2/12/2015Email,Ativan

46, 1, Panic/insomnia,Intradose withdrawals began within days_ experienced somnolence_ crying off and on all day_ depression_ suicidal thoughts_ no motivation for anything_ wanted to hide away from the world.,"I was given Ativan after an ER visit for heart palpitations_ told the physician I could use something to get some sleep and get back on track since I was having anxiety and difficulty coping with events in my life. Big mistake! I began taking .5 mg to sleep. First three nights it worked great. Then in the morning I felt a bit ""off"" and felt like it would be okay if I took a quarter of one (.25 mg). I did this for several days in a row (.50 at night_ .25 in the morning) and quickly began having crying spells during the day. I know what it is to be depressed but this was a very deep depression that just came up so quickly out of nowhere. I ended up acting psycho with an ex boyfriend and also drank at a party and raged on some people there (granted they WERE real jerks but still_ not my style). I was afraid to cut back because I felt like I didn't want to live as it was_ but I am now on day 2 of having cut out the morning dose_ and tonight I'm going to cut the .50 in half. I've been taking loads of niacin (NOT the non-flushing kind)_ I'm taking about 6 100mg pills a day spaced out with food_ this has had a calming effect on me so I'm not taking anything out on anyone. I'm just keeping to myself_ unable to get out of bed really_ crying up a storm over silly things_ worst than when I was pregnant. Feeling that life has no meaning.

47, 5, PMS Anxiety,I have taken Ativan sporadically over the years as needed_ during times of intense anxiety (usually when my PMS clashes with difficult relationships). I just started taking it again after about 7 years off and I'm noticing some fatigue_ lack of ambition...but I think my adrenals and nervous system are already really depleted and Ativan's anxiety reduction is just putting me in touch with how tired I really am.,I absolutely LOVE Ativan. Life can be really hard sometimes. I am an advanced meditator_ yogi_ and holistiic healing professional_ and I know that there are many ways to deal with stress...but sometimes life gets the best of me and when PMS stacks up against PTSD with a big heaping dose of relationship drama or family drama_ I have a really hard time keeping my cool. I have had such bad anxiety attacks that I feel like I can't breathe and that I'm having heart palpitations. When I feel the ice cold hit of cortisol hitting my bloodstream in an intense relationship argument or situation_ I know that it's all over for the day and I'll be just trying to hang on by my fingernails to be able to cope with the day. Ativan changes all of this for me. I only take a half dose_ as needed. My prescription says to take 2 a day_ but I only take about 2 or 3 a week during even the worst stretches of anxiety. One half dose just stops the physiological stress reaction in it's tracks_ and allows me to process the situation with a calm_ cool and collected mind. The heart palpitations and overwhelm vanish_ and I can see the problem clearly and deal with it rationally. Lately I've noticed that I seem to be feeling pretty tired after taking a full dose_ but it's not any more tired than I would have been had I been dealing with an anxiety attack all day and night. I love Ativan and I like to have it available to me when I need it. I've never been inclined to abuse substances_ so for me_ it's a wonde,F,40,10  years1/2 dose 3X W,12/20/2014Email,Ativan

I also was on it for insomnia_ and social anxiety. I had on and off times where I tended to struggle with more depression when got on it and didn't realize it cause more depression and not heal that but it did help some panic attacks for awhile until now. It stopped working sometimes and I think it has me tolerant or dependance on it that gets me overwhelmed so slowy getting off of it since now on clonazepam see too if that helps or not. But these are very dangerous and must be cautious at all times. Lorazepam made me gained more weight too and increased appetite_ and sometimes made me cry more even when it help me sometimes sleep. I just hate struggle with panic attacks. I tried antidepressants like Paxil and Prozac but not good either. I felt very sad and hopeless since I have not many to talk to.I also have no friends too so this makes me even more worse. I am trying to withdrawal lorazepam nice and slowly hope it goes well and clonazepam. I started 4 days ago hope it helps cause it slowly process one.

54, 1, anxiety and chemo,I was depressed to the point of uncontrollable crying_ daily suicidal thoughts_ not talking to best friend for 6 months_ brain fog_ flu-like feeling_ difficulty breathing_ fatigue.  I thought it was from the chemo.  Not True It caused neuropathy in my fingers and toes to not go away.  It can take up to a year to get mental function back_ if ever. Takes 6 weeks to clear body.  Addictive.  I stopped due to news about Ativan and dementia from long term use. My brain felt better in 3 days.  The 5th day I thought  I would die from the withdrawal symptoms.  You can go into convulsions I found out later.,I wanted to die every day.  I prayed for it.  I stopped on September 10_ 2014.  I read it is more difficult to get off than opiates.,F,66,2  years1 1X D,9/17/2014Email,Ativan

56, 5, Panic Attacks,I rated Ativan on this site some 4 years ago. I have taken this medication for some 35 years for panic attacks. For 30 years I took 3 mg a day slowly cutting back to 1 mg.  They did the job. Never had a panic attack again. I have never had any reaction at all. I have flown airplanes_ jumped out of planes_ scuba dived for 15 years with over 500 dives_ rode Harley's for 20 years and gave over 1000 presentations_ and have been a lead medic on an ambulance and have never had any side affects. I have my blood checked every 6 months and have no ill side affects.  I do work out every day running walking and lifting weights. If you have any questions please ask.,,M,66,10  years1 mg,8/20/2014Email,Ativan
57, 1, Nausea,Developed tolerance after taking it for a few months.  My initial symptom (nausea) was getting worse.  New symptoms emerged: anxiety_ tremor_ irritability_ restless_ palpitation_ sweating_ insomnia_ fatigue_ dysphoria_ throat tightness_ headache_ racing thoughts and speech difficulty.  Still experience some symptoms (primarily anxiety and headache) after tapering off 4 months ago.,Be very cautious if you are taking ativan long term (>2-3 weeks).  It did help my nausea in the first few weeks_ but it made me feel worst when I was trying to get off this medication.  Avoid benzo_ it's highly addictive.,M,34,4  months1mg 1X D,7/22/2014Email,Ativan
58, 1, anxiety. I was simply put_ stupid.,Hair loss! Strengthened anxiety(worse) after its affect going out of your body; addictive; joint and muscle pain. Anyone had hair loss because of it? And did it grow back?,,F,28,1  years2g,7/6/2014Email,Ativan
59, 4, PTSD /sleep,None,I take Ativan sublingual and not generic named Lorazepam. I was told by a pharmacologist that many people can't take generic due to liver enzymes being different in everyone. I tried generic and what a difference between the two_ many side side effects I read here.  If you can permit yourself the trade names_ it's worth every penny. While trade and generic names and their active ingredients are the same the other components aren't_ and that's why people react to most of them. Email me with any question.  I have a no substitute rule on meds.,F,,4  years1mg 1X AN,6/19/2014Email,Ativan
