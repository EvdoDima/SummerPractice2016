0, 3, STD,Nausea_ Stomach Pains_ drowsiness and definitely a lot of diarrhea. And one panic attack,"Everyones body is different_ I noticed women have it worst off from this medicine and idk why. But for me I took this around 2pm today after eating Popeyes and 15-20 minutes later I felt like I got the stomach bug with severe stomach pains and nausea_ running to the toilet to go number 2. After that I had a panic attack because I wasn't expecting this feeling. However as the day has been going on I continue to get a bit of sour stomach and nausea before each episode of needing to go to the bathroom. I feel like eating before is a must and drink water or it would have been worse!! It's 5:23 pm and things seem to be settling with very minor stomach pains here and there. I hate the doctors and medicine in general_ they'll give you anything to charge your insurance_ there's better alternatives then this ""fu*k you now you feel sick as hell"" Zithromax pill. As long as this works I'll be happy but never again. Lesson learned.",M,20,1  days1000MG,8/5/2016Email,Zithromax

2, 1, Bronchitis,Severe stomach pains_ anxiety_ anger_ depression_ insomnia_ diarrhea_ massive headache_ vomiting,I just started this today not even 24 hrs ago and I'm have many side effects. I took this antibiotic before and it was all fine but now i can barely stay out of the bathroom because of constant throwing up/diarrhea. And when I'm talking to someone I seem to snap out of nothing! I don't have an history with anxiety or depression but I am very sure I had a panic attack and I couldn't slip crying and feeling just awful. I felt better without this drug. Don't take it. It has far to many side effects that happen way to often,F,17,1  days,7/14/2016Email,Zithromax
3, 1, Some sort of bacterial infection,I took two pills the first day_ one pill the second day as directed. After about 30 hours of taking pills 1&2_ the side effects started. Right ear plugged up_ vertigo began. within 4-6 hours_ panic_ sweats_ vomiting. All bad. I did not take the day 3 dose. I went to the doctor instead. Got a different antibiotic. It's been approximately 6 days since my first dose and I'm still not right. Fatigue is harsh_ still a wee bit disoriented. This drug can't get out of my system fast enough. The side effects seemed to be waning yesterday to the point i declared myself nearly 100%_ but last night i felt like i had a vertigo/insomnia relapse. Mild_ but still kept me up for hours.,take at your own risk.,M,42,2  days500mg 1X D,6/16/2016Email,Zithromax
4, 1, Bronchitis,"First_ you feel a little ""off"" with some weird depression. It feels like doom and gloom. Then you can't eat a thing. Then you develop SEVERE anxiety and panic attacks (heart palpitations_ nausea_ chest pressure_ etc) for no apparent reason. This is how this drug affected me. I was dry heaving all the time. If there was pepper cooking_ I would feel it in my throat and heave. I would vomit from the panic and then panic because I'm vomiting. I had a great job--a math teacher. I took this drug for bronchitis (which ended up being viral) all because my mom wanted me to. She was worried that it would get worse. And I took this evil drug. I couldn't work. I was teaching using post it notes. It was insane. After stopping this drug_ the symptoms of anxiety got worse. Sometimes I felt like I couldn't breathe. I totally isolated myself because even TALKING would make me heave if I breathed funny. For an entire year_ I barely spoke. All I did was read and play jigsaw puzzles while watchi",Some people just need time (a LOT of time) and their symptoms will subside. I wasn't that lucky. I try to post this on here from time to time (although it's been a few years at this point)_ but someone emailed me about this and I decided to post again_ PLEASE email me if you have any questions. There is hope. You are not alone. You can get through this. Good luck to all of you.,F,36,5  days500mg 1X D,6/12/2016Email,Zithromax

A week after that I was still experiencing sore joints and back pain_ acid reflux so I went back to the hospital_ Doctor ran test said I was dehydrated and said I had an uti.

It sped me up. I was sick and up cleaning bc of the med. Every side effect I experienced is on the rare list which just blows my mind.,I have read articles on this medicine and the potential for death by heart attack is scary. Especially since my chest has bothered me since I started it. I'm a healthy 40 yr old female but the fact that my chest bothered me is the reason I sought out info. I workout daily but something is wrong. My husband just finished same dose. He was sick too but worse and it did nothing. We just got back from Dr and he's now on doxycycline.

23, 1, Sinus Infection,Worst medical experience of my life,I was given Zithromax for a severe sinus infection. I am pregnant_ and this was recommended to be best for pregnant women. I was prescribed to take 2_ 250 MG pills on the first day_ but at the advice of my pharmacist_ only took one the first day. I took the first pill around 3 PM_ after a late lunch. Picked up my son and drove home and felt completely fine. I sat down and realized i couldn't read the words on the TV_ so i took out my phone and did the same_ with the same results. The words were blurred and i had a sudden terrible headache behind my eyes .. i laid down for about 20 minutes thinking i was having a migraine (never had one before-but knew symptoms) .. i thought i was better so i stood up_ only to realize that my hands were completely numb and my arms were tingling. After this my mouth/tongue/neck all became tingly and i couldn't get my words out! I was having what i thought was a stroke! My husband was completely freaked out and drove me to the ER_ as i had never experienced anything like this before and i wasn't thinking it could be from a z-pak! Levels were fine_ tests were ran and lots of money were spent .... all because of this medicine. No one in my family will ever be prescribed this drug again! I also suffer from mild anxiety_ and like a lot of others have said_ this is absolutely not a drug for people who already suffer from this ... my heart was beating so fast and i had never had a reaction like this before. BEWARE.,F,27,1  days250MG 1X D,3/3/2016,Zithromax

37, 1, Atypical respiratory infection,Only had minor GI upset but psychological effect is almost unliveable. I have no history of mood or anxiety disorders but this drug gave me MAJOR anxiety_ worry_ fear_ depression_ panic. like a lot of other posts I had almost constant feelings of impending doom and dread. Constant vivid nightmares about death and dying. Extreme paranoia and hypochondria made worse by the amount of aches and pains it causes. At one point I counted up 12 different life threatening illnesses I was convinced I had. My life would have to literally depend on it for me to take this drug again. Last  2 months have been hell_ and I still need to wait for drug to wash out my system.,Think very carefully before taking.

The panic attacks were terrible.I only had 3 pills_ and was sick for over a week. It has been almost 2 weeks; since I took the last pill_ and I am still at times feeling side effects. Conducted research as I thought I was going nuts; found out that there are 2 forms of Zithromax_ Pfizer and PLIVA_ I had the PLIVA (white) pills; not the Pfizer (pink) pills. I do not know if this was the major difference as I have taken Z Pack many times before and never had a problem. This is the worse medicine. I asked the Pharmacist if they had changed the formula she indicated to me that there were no changes. Something has changed.

I'll take this drug any day rather than die a slow_ painful death from pneumonia or sepsis.  For the all the folks on this board whining about the side effects of this antibiotic_ you have obviously never taken Flagyl. Let's keep the side effects in context. Folks_ otherwise healthy people (many of them children) used to drop dead from a wide variety of disease on a daily basis.

It was an endless torturous experience. Didn't link all of this with Zithromax and so wasted loads of money on Upper GI endoscopy_ X-rays_ MRI scan_ ear tests_ CT scan of abdomen_ Ultrasound_ blood work which in turn resulted in ridiculous prescriptions like Nexium_  Ganaton and further antibiotics. Blood work also found elevated levels of liver enzymes and cholesterol levels.,After a protracted period of heartache_ frustration and depression_ I gave up all those medications that arose from an array of misdiagnoses and by sheer luck_ read up about the effects of antibiotics on the web and as per suggestions from some people with similar experience_ started out with a strong probiotics brand called VSL3 which has 100 billion strains of live cultures. The impact was almost miraculous I must say - after a tantalizing 9 months_ I felt human once again. After almost a year on probiotics_ I am still recovering from the horrible damage it did to my gut flora. MY ADVISE - STAY AWAY FROM THIS LIKE PLAGUE.,M,40,4  days500 2X D,11/8/2015Email,Zithromax

On the third day my skin started getting a little itchy but continued taking because I saw no rash. The next week my symptoms hadn't gone away and my eyes starting yellowing. Went into the doctor and my liver enzymes were all too high. Doctors tested for everything and couldn't figure it out; I was sent to a liver specialist (after an ultrasound_ CAT scan and countless blood tests) who determined I had drug-induced hepatitis from the zpack. It's almost 2 months later and my enzymes are still high. Wishing this would go away_ I have extremely intense pruritus_ constipation_ jaundice_ lost 15 pounds and severe fatigue,Will not EVER take again,F,19,5  days500_ 250mg,8/11/2015Email,Zithromax
