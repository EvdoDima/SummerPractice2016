7, 5, Disc degen fibro mitiple breaksBACK,Constipation controlled with stool softners and occational exlax of some type i was switched around several times and finally settled on an extended release MS. My doc retired and upon switching care givers i asked to stay on my exact same mexication i dont feel stoned even taking 60mg IR as needed daily which pushes me to 500mg a day of mprophine it just helps take the edge away.  I work 12hour shifts in oilfield supply and this drug makes that possible.

8, 3, Chronic low back and left leg pain,Constant constipation_ sleeplessness_ dull pain all the time_ sharp pain in low back and down left leg if I stand or squat down for long periods_ like trying to work on my lawnmower.sweating_ nausea and blurred vision.,I actually took MS Contin and it made me deathly sick. I had to stop taking them and was introduced to Kadian as a substitute. I worked for awhile and then I had to increase the strength several times until I got to 80mg. He then put me on Lyrica 150mg twice daily to help the nerve pain in my left leg. Along with Celebrex 200mg and Zoloft for depressiion and pain_ I don't hurt too bad.

It is terrible for me and does NOTHING to help with the pain.

13, 4, DDD_ spinal stenosis,constipation. Take MiraLax for it. MiraLax is great.,Was on ms contin but after taking over a year I would get about 6hrs of relief instead of nearly 12 hrs. Seems to be doing great. What I like is that there are no peaks and valleys with it. Its the same as ms contin. Only difference is the way it is released into your system. It feels more even_ smoother.,M,40,3  days 2X D,2/17/2011,Kadian
14, 4, Fibro_ herniated disc,Constipation,I was on the duragesic patch for 2 1/2 years--it worked but I had a truly bad experience with a bad patch. Per my request my doc took me off of the patch & I needed to be on something and she recommended Kadian. I wish I new about this years ago--this works well for me. I am able to do a lot more--I don't have to worry about anything falling off and not getting the meds. With Kadian and any other controlled medication u must take it as scheduled -- don't miss a dose or you risk withdrawal symptoms. Great medication for those who need it--you must have chronic every day pain & have tried several other narcotics prior to using Kadian. Kadian is a great medication when prescribed ton the right person and taken properly.,F,36,6  months60 2X D,2/14/2011,Kadian
15, 4, DDD_ spondylosis_ herniated disc,Maddening constipation_ but taking fiber pills & eating Shredded Wheat_ apples.,I can actually get out of bed! I also take Vicodin for breakthru pain. The only drawback is very few pharmacies carry this med. I had never heard of it before. Had taken MSER in the past & the difference is Kadian doesn't give you the high feeling_ a GOOD thing.,F,40,3  months20mg 2X D,2/11/2011Email,Kadian
16, 4, Severe Neck and Back Pain/Injuries,Constipation resolved with stool softener/laxative.,I was injured in 2000 and again in 2008.  I am 38 years old and I have severe neck and back pain which basically took my life away from me.  I have been on many medications and tons of Physical Therapy and chiropractic work.  Nothing gave me as much relief that I get from Kadian.  I also take it with Amrix (one nightly) and have Norco 10 for breakthrough pain.  Since starting the Kadian_ there has been a HUGE increase in my activity.  I can walk around the block twice or ride my bike for about 20 minutes. I still have breakthrough pain_ however_ not near the pain I've been in for so many years. I can sleep through the night without pain waking me up any longer. I also don't notice much drowsiness as I did with other medications_ however_ the constipation is no fun. I took a laxative/stool softener nightly with no luck x 4 days.  I finally drank MOM. Nothing.  Drank MOM the next night and ohhhhhh let me tell ya...major incontinence on my way to work the next evening!  Oh my gosh what a horror!  So...I use the stool softener/laxative but will stay away from the MOM! All that said_ I feel that my doctor has given me my life back by prescribing me Kadian and Amrix. Thanks Doc!,F,38,1  years40 mg 2X D,8/27/2010Email,Kadian
17, 5, extreme pain,constipation and the solution is: I take pysullium husks mixed with juice which helps with this issue. I take two heaping tablespoons every other day. You mix it and drink it quick(its a bit unpleasant tasting so I use juice not water) before it gels. I buy the pure husks at whole foods or trader joes!,This med helps me lead a almost normal life. I would have a hard time without it!! I take 15mg oxycodone 3X's a day in addition!,M,57,  2X D,8/25/2010,Kadian
18, 5, several auto immune diseases,mild constipation_ nothing otherwise,i have several auto-immune disease causing severe/constant pain - systemic cns lupus & vasulitis affecting my heart_ brain_ connective tissue_ pulmonary fibrosis_ and suspected MS. i take enough meds as it is_ only had to take it 2xday_ great pain control_ no stomach or fogginess issues_ rarely needed my 'rescue' immediate release dilaudid.,F,42,1.5  years60mg 2X D,8/18/2010,Kadian
19, 3, Chronic low back pain,Constipation(pretty normal with narcotic pain killers) blurred vision(reading close up)and urination problems(starting).,"My local DR eventually had me taking (3) 7.5/750 Hydrocodone 3X a day. While it worked pretty well it lasted 2 hours and the doses just keep increasing. I HATED the ups and downs of the pain with this medication. I felt I was always planning my days with my kids based on my medication. Even planning days at work such as waiting to take my meds so I can sit through an hour meeting. I really liked the ""time release"" aspect of Kadian although it took a couple hours to kick in and NEVER lasted 12 hours like it was supposed to. I was given Morphone Sulphate Immediate Release (MSIR) 15mg_ 2 tablets 2x a day and that helped with the delayed ""kick in"" but didn't help with the voids created with the Kadian not lasting 12hrs. While Skelaxin worked best_ I had to switch to (2) 10mg Flexiral 2X a day. I still struggle with everyday tasks  (20 mins on a riding lawnmower) resulting in a full day sitting in my chair ""recovering."" I guess I have to decide when enough is enough and seek surgery but until then this is better than it was. I have seen my father go through 3 surgery's_ my oldest brother have 1 surgery and the middle brother go through 2 surgery's all with minimal temporary relief only to be worse off after the fact. I will put off surgery as long as possible.",M,43,2  years60mg 2X D,7/31/2010Email,Kadian

22, 4, Low Back Pain,Constipation_ sweating_ rash when combined with some other drugs. Eat high fiber foods like Fiber1_ AllBran that control constipation.,This works for low level constant pain_ but when I walk more than 10 minutes without stopping_ I get a horrible stabbing pain that nothing touches so far. Recently had to stop for 1 month_ had no withdrawal symptoms except for sleeping alot for 1 week.  Low level pain returned & went away when I started Kadian again.,F,64,4  years30 mg 1X D,5/16/2010,Kadian

24, 2, FMS_ Periph-Neuropathy_ Chron Pain_,DRY MOUTH CONSTANTLY - Especially if I wake up during the night or wake-up in general. Always Constipated & Constipation causes more abdominal pain. More Fatigue than I already have from the Fibro_ inconsistency w/length of effects. Sometimes it lasts 8H_ generally only 9-10H tops. Have to use BT meds (Percocet 10/325) in between doses while waiting for next dose and/or when it starts wearing off. Sweating ALWAYS during sleep - sheets soaked. While it does well w/pain relief 2H after dose - 8Hrs_ there is no consistency with continuous relief. I've had to put up with Kadian due to Medicaid mandates (Minimum 90 day trial) before I can switch back to Oxycodone ER 40MG. FAR BETTER RELIEF AND CONSISTENCY with Oxycodone ER 40MG.,I don't understand why Medicaid would pay $450 more for this drug for 3 months instead of continue the Oxycodone ER 40MG. Why make us patients suffer MORE than what we already do. I can't stand how insurance/gov't dictate what is better for you than our Doctors!! There is NO difference between Kadian and Morphine ER - just a name difference. Morphine ER is $150_ Kadian is $650_ Oxycodone ER 40MG is $272.

25, 4, For back and leg pain,Constant itching. Constantly needed benadryl. serious blurred vision.  Doing and completing meaningless tasks.  Thinking hat you are always correct.,Strong drug. A good combination with existing medicine.  Absence of pain.  Canno function in real world activities. Wondering if I'll ever get a tolerance.  Thinking that the world is actually flat.,M,36,3  months120mg 1X D,3/7/2010Email,Kadian
26, 2, severe arthritis pain,honestly felt i received no pain relief from this drug.  i had taken vicodin and percocet previously.  the percocet was far more effective.,very disappointed.  thought it would be better than previous meds tried.,F,76,3  months 2X D,3/6/2010Email,Kadian
27, 4, Spinal degeneration,Of course with this type of drug withdrawal symptoms like sweats tend to come along with the medication. My physician has me on 0.1mg of clonidine 4 times a day to relieve these symptoms. Don't know what I would do without it. Many physicians unfamiliar with pain medications seem to be unaware of how helpful Clonidine is for sweats and other side effects of narcotics.,Kadian has helped me live a somewhat normal life. I cannot do the things I would like to do but the severe pain is relieved. I also take Percocet 10/325 prn for break through pain. As my condition worsens I am afraid the dose of Kadian may have to be increased as walking is becoming increasingly painful.,F,56,8  years130mg 2X D,2/12/2010Email,Kadian
28, 1, Herniated Discs and Surgery,Not an effective RX for long term pain in my case although the doctors said it was for long term relief.  I took 30mg twice daily with Norco for breakthrough pain.  Doctor changed to 50mg once daily.  I asked to be taken off of it and stay on Norco only,CONSTIPATION,M,29,2  months,1/26/2010,Kadian
29, 3, Herniated Discs,Constipation,Taking one 60mg capsule 24 hour slow release at bedtime_ gives me a good few hours sleep but pain control not last all day.   Think doctor needs to give me something for the bad periods to take as needed during the day,F,67,6  weeks,1/12/2010,Kadian
30, 2, Back pain,None that I expirenced,I had bad back pain for about 6 years now. I first started with Kadian 30_ one pill a day for a month and it seemed to do noting for my pain. I then went to Oxycodone_ two 10/325 mg tablets a day. This seemed to help quit a bit_ but still I was in a lot of pain while doing certain things.Yesterday my doctor put me on Kadian 20 which kind of disapointed me knowing Kadian 30 didn't work before. But this time I was to take the Kadian 20 plus my Oxycodone and thought that maybe that would help. It didn't as of yet_ 24 hours later. The only reason I wanted someting different other then the Oxycodone is the Oxycodone don't last long enough and I have to go 14 to 15 hours with out any medication and I'm always being wakened from my sleep in pain. So I haven't goten a good night sllep in years_ well _maybe a few nights. I really don't think doctors give patiants a high enough does of pain killers so that a patiant can led a more normal life_ and thats my problem.... any time I try to do anything I end up in pain for days and I'm pretty much a useless piece of meat.....So this is the seconed time I took Kadian_ the first time for a month with no improvement in pain_ and I didn't expect much with a lower dose this seconed time. Maybe I'll see an improvement in a few days_ but I'm not counting on it.,M,55,1  days,11/26/2009Email,Kadian
31, 2, Neuropathy_ OsteoArthritis,Difficulty urinating is the weirdest_ just have to relax and think about a waterfall. Constipation_ every morning drink a liver cleansing potion of warm water_ lemon juice with fresh squeezed ginger root_ small splash of cayenne pepper sweeten with agauve nectar.  And drink a few ounces of Aloe Vera juice every day.  Really helps maintain a nicely formed stool daily nothing like that messy Miralax.  If I take more than 20mgs Kadian three times a day I get uncomfortably sweaty with the least amount of exertion.,Kadian works for a certain extent but get breakthough pain in my lower back and feet with no other meds for it_ Doc just wants me to take more Kadian!  Medicare won't pay for Skelaxin which works wonders. Sometimes get weepy & morose if I sleep 2 hours past dose time which can happen at times because of the lethargy.  I have tried to detox myself off but it is hard and I don't recommend it to anyone.  In the end there is no perfect drug although I am going back to the Pain Clinic to see what else might help.  All of our bodies react differently to pharmaceutical chemicals and I wish our Doctors would be more aware of it. This site is a great way to self-evaluate my pain needs.,F,50,2  years,11/26/2009Email,Kadian
32, 5, neck_ back_ bilate shoulder pain,Constipation_ relieved with stool softners,"I have never taken Kadian but have a friend who is on it and she is doing great with 40mg BID.  I take Opana which is a similar type of med (schedule II) The difference I see after reading the comments is that I never got the drowsiness_ cotton mouth of the ""high"" that many experience.  I take 40mgs every 12 hours and Norco for breakthrough.  I have had 16 surgeries since 96 and can honestly say the my Pain MD nailed it.  I now have what is considered an active life and play with my 4 grandkids without being bedridden the next day.  If Kadian doesn't work the Opana might.  Good luck to everyone as being in constant pain can really ruin a life.",F,50,2  years,11/19/2009,Kadian
33, 5, Chronic Back Pain,Severe constipation cured by diet and Miralax_Cotton mouth - drink lots of water and sugarfree gumDrowsiness - keep going and let body adjust,NO HIGHS which is important to me.  The pain JUST disappears.  Hydrocodone 5-mg/350-mg for break thru pain.  Not all doctors know how to prescribe pain med's.  I worked with a pain specialist (Voted Best Pain Dr.) to find what worked for me and what didn't.  Kadian much better than pain patches for me! I've had to increase the amount over time but this amount is working for me.  I'm not pain free but I now have a life.,F,65,4  years,11/2/2009,Kadian

The second time about 2 days later it worked a bit but not nearly as well as the first time. It feels very unpleasant when it kicks in_ not at all pleasant like I was expecting (given it's so frequently abused I was expecting to feel lovely and ""high"" and I didn't in the slightest). It's only worth taking if you're in a LOT of pain_ and then only once or twice.",M,29,3  days,9/15/2009,Kadian
38, 1, back pain,my life was all but gone.,This drug practically killed me.  My doctor had me on 130mg. of Kadian along with 8 15 mg. tablets of oxycodone a day_ and up to 1600 mg of Skelaxin_ and 4 1 mg tablets of Klonopin.  Pretty much all I did was sleep.  It is extremely addictive_ and way too easy to undo the capsules and take out a few extra pellets.  Your body will continually crave more.  There is no way not to become addicted to it if you are on it for more than a short time.  I was on all this stuff for 9 months_ and finally went to a detox center for ten days to be taken off all of it.  A month later_ I am finally well enough to drive_ walk_ eat normally_ but not sleep_  my psychiatric doctor says it will probably be several more weeks before I'm back to normal.  It was awful getting off the stuff_ even at a place where they take good care of you and give you things to make you feel better.  When I got home I was still in major detox_ hallucinating_ throwing up_ everything including water tasted like cigarette ashes.  I can't stress it enough- don't take this drug!,F,53,9  months,9/3/2009,Kadian
39, 3, 3 herniated disks cervical & lumbar,sweating that soaks everything_ gastric statis that leads to sudden vomiting_ unending battle with constipation_ break through withdrawl symptoms_ like I'd missed a dose when I haven't,Chronic pain rules my life. After trying everything I started 20mg once daily_ no relief until I got to 50mg 2x day_ I still had break thru pain but only rec 4 tylenol #3/day for that due to my Dr.'s paranoia_ I intially rec'd 6 to 8 a day & that worked well but he dec all his patients down to 4 a day lest someone injures their liver (why he can't prescribe it with aspirin I don't know).  My life was tolerable for 2 1/2 years on this program but for last few months I develop withdrawl symptoms at 4am (from my 7pm dose) that last until about 10am_ same thing in the evening_ sometimes it covers & sometimes it doesn't & I cannot see what is making it so.  I've tried eating_ not eating_ etc.  I go today & I don't know whether to ask him to up it to 60mg twice/day or just to shoot me!,F,49,3  years,8/24/2009,Kadian

I have also begin to have severe_ untreatable itching all over my body; I had itching in just one spot for many months_ and now it has spread (this is a side effect of morphine). Slept 12 hours or more per night for the first many months_ but now I start to hurt severely all over if I stay in bed for more than 9 hours_ so I *have* to get up!,"I was on generic morphine sulfate 3x/day for years_ and switched to 130mg of Kadian to avoid gaps in pain control with 2x/day dosage. It does not control the pain as well as MS or Oxycontin.I was able to reduce my dosage slightly without any problems_ one time when I wanted to try to quit (heh). I have not tried to quit completely_ but it gives me hope.I wish doctors would prescribe Kadian for more than 30 days' supply.  I drive four hours round-trip every month just to get 30 days' worth of pain medicine_ and sometimes have to fight for getting it at a pain doctor's office I have been going to for five years!Of course_ some of the problem is people who abuse morphine_ but denying it to people who actually do need it is inhumane_ and making patients pay for an office visit every month is greed on the physicians' part.To Actavis_ the maker of Kadian :  please find a way to make Kadian less abuse-able for those who would do that_ so that maybe actual pain patients will have an easier time convincing doctors to prescribe it for mail-order amounts (90 days).  Thank you!I did not choose a 5 rating here because it has not gotten rid of the pain_ only lessened it.  The rating chart says a 5 means ""this medicine cured me"" ... pain medicine does not CURE anything!",F,37,8  months,5/19/2009,Kadian
43, 4, spinal arthritis_ fibromyalgia,Hot flashes/sweats_ constipation (controlled with Miralax)_ occasional sleepiness.,Kadian has been effective in reducing pain_ with some malingering. Previously prescribed oxycontin for more than a year and was then was switched to Kadian_ 50 mg. I didn't notice a big difference in managing my pain.  Also take breakthrough meds (Norco)_ which seem to work more effectively_ but not long lasting. I also experience migraines which are controlled with generic Imitrex.  Finally_ I am also taking Celexa_ which I feel may add to the hot flashes/sweats.  The combination of meds may be exacerbating my menopausal symptoms.,F,48,10  months,5/8/2009,Kadian

I quit it cold-turkey after ~3 months. No side effects of quitting it_ to my (and my doctor's) surprise! I now take it infrequently for really bad days.

48, 5, diabetic neuropathy,constipation(bad) uses miralax daily to control. some sweats infrequently. full feeling in the ears causing pain when sounds are present. some problems getting urine to pass. no sexual ability whatsoever. extremely lethargic.,ive tried every kind of pain killer on the market_ even had a device implanted in my butt to deliver small shocks to my spine to control the pain(after 2 years they gave up trying to program it and make it work).the kadian is the only medicine that has been able to keep the pain just below the threshold_ i know its there but i can get around and do some things.for all the problems it has its still better than the cocktail of drugs ive used before_ every side effect is manageable_ and the pain control is quite noticeable.this drug is a god send_ without it i wouldnt be able to stay alive the pain is that bad without it.im currently using 600mg once a day with the 100ug fentyl patch.better living thru chemistry.(someone holds the copyright on that line).,M,57,5  years,3/1/2009Email,Kadian
49, 1, Chronic pain from previous injuries,PAIN_ LACK OF RELIEF,I have been approved for Rx Assistance through Kadian Pharmaceticals (previously prescribed MS Conitin 60 mg_ plus Percocet 10/325's for breakthrough pain) & this is my first day taking this brand of medication & in all honesty I must say that I am very disappointed. I have been suffering from chronic pain for many yrs (was injured in an automobile accident_ have had multiple surgeries_ in addition to developing Rheumatoid Arthritis & later Endometriosis) and have taken many different pain relievers (various generics/etc.) & before taking the Kadian brand of extended release morphine_ the 60mg actually helped me_ so long as I took oxycodone (Percocet) for breakthrough pain~but_ this is like taking a placebo/sugar pill! Let me state for the record that I_ like most people suffering from chronic pain_ do NOT take opiate-pain-meds to 'feel good' or get high~it's a quality of life issue. And while I'm aware of slight differences between brands (regardless of what pharmacist,F,38,1  days,1/30/2009,Kadian

53, 5, Pain management hysterectomy,Little bit of constipation. Make sure to eat plenty of fiber and take a stool softener. Very addictive. For me there was a high for the first couple of days_ but that is over. Relieves the pain greatly for 6-8 hours.  Also taking this along with Oxycodone. Dosage of Kadian is 20mg I am hearing that Kadian has bad withdrawel. But haven't reached that fun time yet :P This one makes me really sleepy!  I take this before bed and I am out like a light within 10 minutes!,I am on a low dose of 20mg.Suppose to take one in the morning (since I am still pretty much in bed all day_ the tiredness is okay) and another one at night.  Sometimes I have to cheat though_ my tolerance has already gotten used to it_ plus it is a very low dose.  Helps manage the pain for 6-8 hours okay I guess.  The doctor put me on this because after having a hysterectomy 7 weeks ago_ I was still having a lot of pain and the oxycodone was barely helping anymore.  I think my body has a high tolerance for pain meds.  But I have a very low tolerance for pain!!  I sure will be glad when this story of my life is over. :) This is one of those addicting drugs that takes a lot of will power to not take too many of to control the pain completely.  And I am not even going to get into how bad it is with the oxycodone with the will power!  I can sure see how people get addicted to it! The body goes nuts for it.  At least mine sure is.

55, 3, Restless Leg Syndrome/Leg Pain,Really bad nervous jittery feeling. Felt like my heart was trying to jump out of my chest. Could not sit still. Profuse sweating with chills. Seems more like taking speed than a narcotic.,Does eliminate the RLS pain and discomfort but not worth the trade off of the side effects. After discontinuing Kadian RLS came back with a vengeance.,M,50,5  days,9/19/2008,Kadian

58, 2, Fusion L4-L5 and L5-S1,Constipation is horrible.  I take OTC MiraLax to get rid of it.  I started eating apples and they help a lot.  I have headaches that won?t go away by taking any OTC drugs.  I have to sleep through my dosage or headaches get worse.  I get a shaky feeling inside and I feel sick to my stomach quite often.  I notice if I take the pill at 8pm and sleep until about 11am I feel pretty good the rest of the day.  If I take the pill at 8pm and wake up at 8am I feel terrible for the rest of the day.  The pain is not relieved from taking the medication.  I also take Oxycodine 15mg immediate release for breakthrough pain.  I stopped taking the Oxy because I thought that was what was making me feel bad_ but now I know that it is the Kadian.,,F,41,6  months,8/16/2008,Kadian
59, 3, low back/sacroilliac & hip pain,CONSTIPATION & SEVERE ITCHING WITH RASH AND FINE BUMPS ALL OVER. Cannot sleep through the night_ sweats and chills_ wierd dreams_foggy slow thinking_ 'don't feel like doing much' attitude. Mainly_ the constipation_ the terrible itching_ and feeling like I have morning sickness 24/7. I don't even like eating anymore...my tongue feels tingly_ low appetite_ nausea and fear of the dreaded CONSTIPATION!,Kadian does the job...HOWEVER...I need to make a judgement call on overall feeling. Yes the pain is reduced yet the rest of me (my mind_ body and spirit)is suffering one way or the other. Kadian 40mg/day. I also take 75mg of Lyrica 4xday(good for the nerve pain). I am so tired but can only grab cat naps.,F,47,2  months,6/16/2008,Kadian
