0, 1, Severe seasonal allergy,Did not help at all_could not focus trying to pack for vacation(have packed for years) very difficult crazy bad dreams_confusion waking up like you where in a dream,Would NEVER take this drug again they say there are no side effects with this drug_ I say they are crazy should certainly have precautions before taking it there are major side effects,F,77,1  days80 1X D,8/14/2016,Depo-medrol
1, 2, Severe seasonal allergy,First_ acute spike in blood pressure and heart rate_ anxiety_ difficulty sleeping (even sitting still)_ acid stomach_ belching. Next day_ alarming physical weakness_ dizziness_ depression. Starting that second night_ heavy but unrestful sleep with unusually vivid_ crazy_ even revolting bad dreams (normally_ I rarely even remember my dreams) with lingering gloom on waking. (Now I dread going to sleep!) Pain from hip injection much worse 3 days afterwards_ despite hot baths and massaging the area; feels like my hip was hit with a sledge hammer!,"Depo-Medrol alleviated about 95% of my major allergy miseries in 24 hours_ but then the ""roller coaster"" of very unpleasant side effects after that are a whole new bunch of miseries! I think next time I'll suffer through the allergy with more OTC meds rather than undergo these awful side effects again!! The doctor said this shot could give me amazing relief. Well_ yes...and NO!!!",M,65,1  days80mg 1X D,8/8/2016,Depo-medrol
2, 5, Sciatica or extreme lower back pain,No side effects,I believe I suffer from sciatica. 6 months ago this happened and a doctor told me that's what it is. It's only in my back_ I don't feel any discomfort in my legs or hips. Strictly lower back. Anyways_ I couldn't tell you what happened but like a light switch_ yesterday_ my back started in. This morning_ I couldn't dress myself. Literally. Couldn't walk normally_ the worst_ most extreme back pain I have ever experienced. I'm a nurse for a doctor and it occurred to me that could give myself this shot. The 5 or 6 800mg ibuprofen cut nothing. Advil_ did nothing_ bengay_ nothing. No exaggeration_ not one bit of relief. So_ I got to work drew up the 1 ml of depo medrol and for good measure I drew up a nice 3mg of toradol. As fast as I could_ I shot myself in my right deltoid muscle. About 2 minutes later I could walk normally. My back was still tight but a good 80% of the pain was gone. It's now 645pm and I'm still very comfortable. Little tight but pain is minimal. I gave myself these shots at about 745am.,F,32,1  days1ml,6/23/2016,Depo-medrol
3, 5, Severe rash on hands and feet,No side effects only relief!,I've had a horrible rash almost like poison ivy/oak. Derm says it is contact dermatitis. I've gone to walk in clinics and demand a shot of Depo instead of other steroids. The rash completely goes away for approximately 45 days. After steroid  wares off rash comes back. Once itches is unbearable after 2 to 3 weeks I go on the hunt for a new walk in clinic that will give me an a shot of Depo I ask for 2 ml of 40 mg and I'm good for another 2 months.Most amazing drug.

After two weeks I got a terrible itching rash that spread from my arms to my stomach_ legs_ back_ neck_ and buttocks.  It has been going on for 4 weeks.  Went to a dermatologist who put me on prednisone to relieve these symptoms.  Still have them and my course of prednisone will end in 3 days.  I cannot sleep at night because of the itching.  The rash is horrible!,I have had a terrible allergic reaction to this steroid.

12, 1, Hives,When our daughter was in college and getting ready for her wedding she had unexplained hives. Went to doctors and the nurse gave her a kenalog injection not in the hip in case of side effect but in the arm. She had the side effect of muscle wasting at the injection site. Not good when you are about to get married and in a sleeveless dress. We visited the doctors office not to sue but to advise and work a solution out. We asked them to pay for what our insurance did not cover to have it fixed. They did_ thank heavens. Our daughter had plastic surgery to repair. It fixed it and she has had no problems since. The plastic surgeon said sometimes it can recur even after surgery but it did not. That's been about 9 years ago. It was outpatient surgery. Steroid shots or Meds are Very risky. I'm sure they can help but can also hinder. Use your own judgement. We never found out the cause of her hives? Maybe nerves from upcoming wedding? Not sure. I would say be aware and proceed with extreme caution if you ever need to have an injection or need the medicine.,,F,21,1  days60mg?,12/15/2015,Depo-medrol

Yes they do give you some unpleasant side effects but these are short term and what are they in comparison with extreme joint pain and stiffness?! The worst one personally experienced is anxiety.

23, 2, Severe hip arthritis,None - just some soreness for a day or two,I was diagnosed with severe arthritis in my hip and was told I'd need a hip replacement at some point. The doc said I could get relief from these shots until they didn't work anymore_ at which point I'd probably want to go ahead with the hip replacement. I had one 80 mg shot under a fluoroscope in Aug 2014_ and it gave me almost complete pain relief for 8 weeks. I had another shot in Nov 2014_ and it gave me no relief. I had a third shot March 2015_ and I had relief for about 4 days before the pain returned. I'm now talking about hip replacement with my doctor.,F,40, 80 1X O,3/16/2015,Depo-medrol

25, 1, Neck pain,I received 3 epidural injections of Depo Medrol. Once a week for 3 weeks. I had reaction after 3rd. Waiting 15 minutes after injection before leaving office. I had taken Valium before procedure and dozed off. When I woke after the alarm went off_ I could not move any part of my body and barely able to move my mouth to talk. They rushed me to room with oxygen etc and it took abt an hr and half before I had feeling again. I asked doctor what had happened. He said not sure maybe a reaction to numbing injection. Well after 1st injection severe pain at neck and unusual eating habits. I told doctor on 2nd visit. He said wow that's odd. 2nd injection I told him the same. No response. Well after the 3 they called and cancelled my 4th. So now 6 weeks later...i have gained 30 lbs_ difficulty breathing_ pain in whole body especially legs. I have had severe cognitive issues. Not remembering short term things especially. It seems some things have improve d_ but others keep getting worse. I was 117 lbs when I started these epis. Now I'm miserable in pain and depressed.

27, 1, Allergies,EXTREME insomnia_ EXTEME fatigue_ anxiety_ increased libido but unable to climax_ the list goes on and on.,My allergies became out of control while moving house (dust) so after a week of suffering I went to the dr hoping to get some relief. This was 2 days ago. I have had no relief from my allergies but that now fades into insignificance to the issues I now have. I have not slept since having the injection and have now been awake for more than 2 days. I can get a few minutes of dozing sleep in which I have strange dreams but can't get any deep sleep. Doing anything is very difficult even basic daily tasks. All I want to do is sleep but can't. I had to defer my uni exams because I am very sick and have no focus. My libido is out of control but I can't climax_ this is very strange and frustrating. I have never felt worse and am very worried about what's to come. This drug is poison. Do not go near it with a 50 foot barge pole. I went back to my dr today who said that there are no side effects with this drug. What a load of crap! She even offered to give me another 40mg dose to try and help with my allergies to which I said NO!!!!! I would jump off a bridge before I would be injected with this poison again.

29, 1, BronchoSpasm (Asthma),I've had depo before and it never did this to me before. Extremely rapid heart beat_ irregular heart beats_ and fluttering heart with any movement (no endurance). Shallow breathing. Could not walk far without feeling my heart was about to burst. Could not swat a fly without my heart overreacting and going wild. Slightest emotion caused my heart to go wild. Felt like acid or fire running through my arm and neck veins. Twice I almost died. Felt like I was in the 7th circle of hell! Felt like fire_ then antifreeze_ running through every cell of my body with rapid heart. Muscle weakness. It has been 20 days since receiving the shot and I'm still having symptoms.

Also_ the injection had no therapeutic effect whatsoever. It seems there is a common_ scenario - what I experienced along with many others - that makes me wonder about the competence of doctors who administer these injections: doctors not informing patients in advance about possible long-term_ serious side effects; doctors being far too cavalier in administering these injections; doctors denying side effects patients experience (some patients are told that they have ""anxiety issues"" or it's all in their heads! - read reviews elsewhere_ the level of medical incompetence is truly amazing); and doctors being completely uneducated about side effects.",PLEASE_ everyone who has experienced serious adverse reactions to corticosteroid injections_ file a report with the FDA: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053074.htm or call the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 to report by telephone. I had trouble filing online and sent a hardcopy to the FDA (which was acknowledged by letter from the FDA). Lawsuits are very difficult to bring_ and the only way to force responsible administration of these potent drugs is for EVERYONE who has suffered serious side effects to report to the FDA. Corticosteroid use (abuse) is now booming business for doctors and drug companies_ and it seems that the administration of these drugs has become unbelievably irresponsible.

Not warned of any serious side effects when I specifically asked and docs later denied any connection between injection and side effects.,"Google article ?Understanding Potential Complications Of Epidural Steroid Injections: Practitioners need to understand and educate their patients regarding the full scope of potential side effects that can occur when receiving epidural steroids."" The article states: ?Despite the indisputable rise in the number of pain interventions_ little has been written about the potential side effects of administering steroids into the epidural space. In fact_ many premier textbooks allocate only a couple of pages to exploring glucocorticoid mechanism of action and then only briefly mention potential side effects. This lack of understanding has led many practitioners to nai?vely view steroids as benign drugs without fully comprehending the broad scope of potential side effects that can occur when steroids are injected into the epidural space . . . to understand the full scope of complications that can arise from epidural administration of glucocorticoids_ it is necessary not only to understand the technical/mechanical complications that occur with needle placement_ but also to grasp the role of pharmacokinetics_ steroid particulate size_ and_ most importantly_ how glucocorticoids affect nearly every organ system.?Also google 1.25.12 Bloomberg News article ""Bristol-Myers Warning Ignored on Steroid Shots Tied to Deaths""",F,36, 80 1X D,8/14/2012,Depo-medrol
50, 1, supposed trigger point in back,Update from 7.5.12 and 7.10.12 postings: side effects of pain in extremities persist as well as extreme fatigue. Also_ the injection had no therapeutic effect whatsoever.,"I have done quite a bit of research on Depo-Medrol and corticosteroids in general since many MDs seem clueless about the side effects of the drugs they most frequently prescribe and have no interest in problem solving. For those with an indentation from soft tissue injections_ find medical article ""Treatment of Local_ Persistent Cutaneous Atrophy Following Corticosteroid Injection with Normal Saline Infiltration"" by PETER R. SHUMAKER_ MD_ JAGGI RAO_ MD_ AND MITCHEL P. GOLDMAN_ MD. The article is in the following journal: Dermatol Surg 31:10:October 2005. Apparently_ saline infiltration which is easy to do_ works to fix the indentation (but good luck finding a doctor who has heard of this); you should be able to find the abstract for the article online and the paper at a medical school library. A good dermatologist should know about this technique or be willing to investigate it for you. This doctor is familiar with the technique and it might be worth contacting him: MELVIN A. SHIFFMAN_ MD_ JDSection of Surgery_ Newport Specialty Hospital_Tustin_ California.  For other issues such as muscle weakness_ extreme fatigue_ nerve issues_ get your adrenal glands checked by a GOOD endocrinologist. Corticosteroids are known to interfere with adrenal gland function which can result in a host of uncomfortable to debilitating symptoms. I hope this information might help someone suffering from a terrible reaction to corticosteroid injections.",F,,1  days20 1X D,7/18/2012,Depo-medrol
51, 1, supposed trigger point,Update from 7.5.12: all side effects persist.,"Found out proper dosage for depo-medrol. In addition to being in the package insert material it's posted in the July 15_ 2002 issue of the American Family Physician Journal (article title ""Joint and Soft Tissue Injection""): 2 to 10 mg for soft tissue and small joints. So_ the 20 mg I received for one trigger point (soft tissue injection) is excessive. I was told by the doctor who injected this that I was receiving a ""tiny amount"" of depo-medrol_ and when I later complained about side effects_ I was told that the dose was a ""pediatric"" amount. Btw_ I'm under 100 lbs. and along with horrible nerve related side-effects_ lost weight because of this injection.		",F,44,1  days20 mg 1X D,7/10/2012,Depo-medrol
52, 1, supposed trigger point in back,menstrual irregularities; red face and chest; extreme insomnia; pain/tingling/numbness/weakness in extremities - arms_ hands_ legs_ feet.,"Just one trigger point injection of 20 mg. depo-medrol 3 1/2 months ago resulted in numerous side effects. The menstrual irregularities_ red face and chest and extreme insomnia have subsided_ but the pain in arms_ hands_ legs and feet persists and isn't letting up at all. I was told by my doctor that this was merely a ""pediatric"" dose and harmless. Well_ not for me and it may well not be a small dose for the purposes of one trigger point injection. Corticosteroids are very potent drugs and in my experience with both depo-medrol and kenalog (also horrible side effects) doctors tend to be incredibly cavalier in administering these meds and have a collective blind spot when it comes to side effects.",F,44,1  days20 mg 1X D,7/5/2012,Depo-medrol
53, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis,"A single Depo-Medrol injection was prescribed by my rheumy one week ago as a ""bridge"" to manage pain from RA until the Methotrexate and Enbrel take affect.  Took 2 days to feel any benefit from the injection_ but it has helped immeasurably.  At day six I experienced an anxiety attack in the middle of the night with perceived difficulty breathing.  I experienced this same side effect 4 years ago while taking the pill form for several weeks due to a neck injury_ so I was prepared for it.  If not for the anxiety attacks_  I would be very satisfied with this medication.  Depending on any returning pain levels as this injection wears off_  I may submit to another one to continue to hold me over until the other meds kick in.  Also_  found the injection to have much more efficacy over the pill form.  Good luck to you who are reading this and I hope this review helps you.  As a footnote_  I want to also mention that I am not normally prone to anxiety attacks and have only experienced them while taking Prednisone.",,F,46,1  days80 mg,7/4/2012Email,Depo-medrol

55, 1, contraception,"I would say to ANY girl or women considering this to not even think twice. I'm 21 years old and been on the injection for one year then in January 2012 I experienced extremely painful stomach pains which prevented me from walking. I now live on 30mg of codeine (which doesnt touch my pain) and diclofenick for an anti inflammatory then a tablet to prevent ulcers on my stomach. For a 21 year old girl who is obviously planning to have children then to be told you have cysts is my worst nightmare. I now have the option of halving my chances and removing an ovary if this cyst turns cancerous_ put up with the pain or wait for them to shrink. I have already been told it will take me up to 5 years to conceive and it really upsets me. The worst part was that the dep website has the cheek to say ""dep decreases the chance of cysts"" this is not true as me and a close friend have experienced the exact same problems.

57, 1, Seasonal allergic rhinitis,Danger!! This drug gave me diabetes! I had blood glucose of 5.2 mmol always before given this shot for my allergies. Didn't help the allergies. Now two months on and the effects should have worn off_ but instead it raised my blood glucose levels to 11-15mmol. Now I'll be on diabetic drugs_ probably for the rest of my life and not counting the potential organ damage that goes with it. I asked the foc when he gave me the shot what side effects I can expect and he said none. What a bunch of liars! Don't care what happens to me but I'll never set foot inside another doctors office again for however long I live.
