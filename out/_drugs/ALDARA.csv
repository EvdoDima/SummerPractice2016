0, 1, BCc,Trouble breathing_  and horrible weakness. I have never felt this bad in all my life. Can't get my strength back.,It works_ but I guess it's different for everyone. I wouldn't use it again.,F,59,6  weeks5 mg.,7/8/2016Email,Aldara
1, 5, HPV,Itching_ redness_ flakiness.,My treatment includes TCA and Aldara. I use the Aldara as directed and apply a small amount directly to the areas that need it 3 times a week and rub it in until you can't see the cream_ per the directions. I'm not sure why the consensus of many people seems to be that clearing up warts should be symptom free and painless. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.I got the expected redness_ itching_ and flakiness expected when healing up an abnormal skin condition. Also_ the cream is working quickly in conjunction with the TCA treatment.I have zero abnormal or unexpected side effects.,F,29,3  weeks 3X W,6/27/2016,Aldara

3, 2, hpv,I was diagnosed with hpv in my anal areaAfter about 10 freezing treatments and the outcome bleak I was put on this creamI was somewhat disappointed as I was expecting a bit of discomfort to give me an Indication of whether or not this aldara treatment is working but had nothing till the second week and then the only thing ive had is pain in my groin glands and a tiny bit of itching but im unsure if it?s the cream working on the hpv or the hpv multiplying as ive recently felt a new wart. Im only the second week so I shall continue_ tonight is my 5th application ive read tbis cream is more responsive in females than males and can take along has 16 weeks. So as if yet im staying positive and carrying on. If this cream is uncomfortable I can imagine people will feel shite excuse my french. But isnt the short term discomfort worth it for ur sex life and to make you feel attractive again? I have no clue who gave me this but I curse them everyday my advice us its 16 weeks of hell if you have a reaction but atleast u know its working. I have no idea yet an that does my tree in.Im assuming it is having some effect as my groin glands are  tender so fingers crossedUnless you plan on being a nun or priest guys id advise complete treatment,I rated not satisfied only as I cant tell if its working yet,M,32,10  days,5/25/2016Email,Aldara
4, 2, GW,Extreme fatigue_ migraine_ depression_ anxiety attacks,The burning sensations whilst uncomfortable was manageable.

5, 2, Gw,Swelling_ rash_ intense pain_ hypersensitive to pee/water as if I have several cuts down there_ bleeding.,My treatment involves both freezing and using Aldara after to speed up the process to rid gw. First time I used Aldara_ only had mild irritation. Was grateful not to have experienced the possible side effects mentioned by my doctor. However_ after my last freezing session_ I used Aldara for 3x a week and after my 3rd application_ it began to swell and itch. A few days have passed since my last Aldara application but the swelling only got worse and adding more side effects to it. The itching was replaced by unbearable pain despite taking NSAIDs. I started bleeding and my inner folds of my vagina is clearly inflamed as well. I used the cream really sparingly every time! So I don't understand why it is acting up when I was fine with it before. It's really bad. I'd recommend just go with freezing only. It isn't as painful as the side effects I'm experiencing from Aldara.,F,,1  weeks,5/4/2016,Aldara

7, 1, BCC on chest,This is an update to an entry I submitted on 9/10/2014. Unfortunately I cannot seem to update my original post. I had been advised to used Aldara once daily for 5 days per week for a total of 6 weeks.I had severe symptoms of fever_ dizziness_ muscle aches and feeling teary. I stopped using Aldara upon my doctors orders due to the severity of the physical wound- the size of a 50 cent piece_ even though I had been very cautious to use the bare minimum of cream to a BCC not much larger than a grain of rice.,I stopped using this cream after week 5 and hoped my symptoms would abate- they did not. It has been 19 months since I used Aldara. The dizziness I developed while using Aldara has never totally gone. I also developed tinnitus so consulted an ENT who diagnosed ATYPICAL Me?nie?re's disease. I do not suffer rotational spinning (typical to Me?nie?re's)_ rather a constant disequilibrium_ like having been on a boat too long. It's exhausting and has affected every aspect of my life. I have questioned doctors as to whether this could have been caused by Aldara_ all have said no_ even though it came on at the same time I was using it. All doctors have said even the flu like symptoms I was experiencing were unrelated to Aldara (they had never heard of that despite it being noted as a side effect!) -that I must have had a virus! In the past 19 months I have spoken to others that have used Aldara. Some who have experienced no ill effects whatsoever_ and some like myself who have_ in our opinions_ had our lives screwed up to varying degrees because of this drug. To others reading this and considering using this as a treatment_ consider ALL of your treatment options before making a decision.I thought a topical cream would be a safe_ non invasive form of treatment. But to me_ Aldara is a horror of a drug wrapped up with a pretty name.,F,49,5  weeks 1X D,4/3/2016Email,Aldara

10, 3, HPV Genital Warts,My balls are in agony.Soreness_ blistering and dryness.,I've been using Aldara for just over 3 weeks_ every two days. I have ten warts_ all about the size of a pin head (thanks_ ex!). The two largest warts have nearly gone but I still have a few around the base of my penis. I made what seems to be a common mistake and used too much cream in an attempt to speed up the process.Mistake. Woke at 4am with a fire in my groin and it's been like that since. Can't sit down or work. I have a line of five sore_ open blisters on my scrotum and all I can do is lay in bed with my legs open.My fault for going a bit gung-ho with this stuff but I didn't expect a reaction like this. I've been feeling sick and depressed for a few days too_ but I'm not sure if I can blame that on Aldara or my love life.,M,41,3  weeks.5mg x2 d 1X D,3/21/2016Email,Aldara
11, 1, GW,This medicine was absolutely awful. I experienced extreme pain and ulcerations that developed from using this cream. I missed 2 days of work because of the pain. It felt like I was peeing razor blades. My labia became so swollen that I couldn't urinate. My doctor told me it WAS NOT a reaction to the cream and that I had genital herpes despite blood tests coming back negative. Needless to say I am firing my doctor.

Run from this cream.,,,30,3  months,3/7/2016,Aldara
14, 1, GW,Please be SO so so careful and fully informed before using this cream! Absolutely fuming_ when I was prescribed this medication the nurse did not inform me at all of the risks...she told me to dab bits on the warts_ not rub it in and wash off whenever i wake up. All she explained was it helps fight the virus. Due to being completely uninformed I applied the cream to the warts_ got dressed for bed and went to sleep.In the morning I have not experienced pain like it_ its excruciating. Every part of my vagina has swelled up and it is completely unrecognizable_ it is red raw and when I urinate it is like urinating razor blades. My vagina skin is purple_ blue and black. I held an iced pack wrapped in a towel as pain relief and co-codamol which helped slightly. Things seemed to be improving today with less pain but still ridiculous swelling... when suddenly i started bleeding and my skin has burst in places. I cant move/walk. I am so upset because if the nurse had taken the time to explain,Once everything settles down_ i will build up the courage to use it in the correct way. It is so frustrating that a health professional has not informed me correctly and it has resulted in this. Its not the kind of medication to just lather on AT all which I thought it was. Make sure you are very well informed before considering using this dangerous cream.,F,20,3  days1 month 3X W,2/28/2016,Aldara

Unfortunately_ I had a shoulder surgery and as that healed up fast_ my warts came back. Treating them now. It is only one wart that sprouted. As opposed to the first occurrence which was about 5.

19, 3, GW,"Ok_ I'm really hoping this helps someone.  I started taking Aldara for a flat wart (I couldn't even see it or feel it but it was itchy). After 5 days (every night before bed)_ I was a horrible mess; severe pain_ blisters_ bleeding_ oozing_ swelling_ scabbing_ severe back pain and horrible headaches.  I couldn't walk_ or go to the bathroom / shower & laid in bed crying for 3 days.  I basically ""burned my vagina off."" I stopped using it and began using Lydicane_ Triple Antibiotic Ointment with pain relief and Vivadin for the pain.  It took about 5 days before I was completely back to normal.  DO NOT USE ANY OTHER KINDS OF RELIEF OR STEROIDS- it'll make it worse. And even though one Dr. said it ""looked"" like a Herpes outbreak_ it wasn't.   Now my original symptoms are back even though everything looks completely normal.  My Dr. has me trying it again only 2-3 times a week.  So far_ so good.  Here's what I'm doing: only use a little bit and only on the spot(s) necessary.  Prior to application_ put Vaseline around all the other areas to protect it_ and again_ just a little bit on the area needed.  I'll follow up when I'm done_ but I've been told 3 months.  Good luck!! It will get better!",,F,33,1  weeks,12/12/2015,Aldara
20, 3, Anal Warts,Itching_ Soreness_ Sensitivity,I have just finished week 3 out of 4 week treatment plan. I think overall the warts around my anus have reduced in size and look as though they could be getting better however i think it will take more than the 4 weeks. Had to miss a treatment in week 2 as area around anus was very painful and even hurt when having shower/bath.No feelings of nausea or headaches.A lot of negativity on this thread_ I think the important thing is to keep your doctor updated on the process and not to give up if the treatment you have been given doesn't work. If this treatment doesn't work for you then tell a doctor. Having GW makes you feel uncomfortable and disgusting and can make you feel depressed. DON'T LET IT.

I'm about to start my third week on Imiquimod_ and my semi-large wart is all but gone.  It just vanished_ almost overnight!  My doctor recommended taking a multivitamin with folic acid in it_ and I think that helped a lot too (I have a horrendous immune system_ and folic acid boosts it).  I also second that you don't need to use a lot of cream.  I got 6 uses_ or two full weeks_ out of one packet_ and obviously I'm having a ton of improvement.,F,23,2  weeks 3X W,10/22/2015,Aldara

I could not urinate without experiencing terrible pain_ It even hurt to walk_move and sleep at night. I wish I would have looked at the reviews before using this medicine.

26, 5, Genital warts,Irritation and itching.,I had a bout of several genital warts_ all spaced all over my genital area (clitoris included people.) After having read about this treatment on line_ I was so scared that I did not use it for about two weeks but for me the liquid nitrogen was way too painful_ especially on my lady button.I really want to spread this news as much as possible; EVERYBODY REACTS DIFFERENTLY. Please_ please do not be discouraged. I am very sensitive to pain (translation_ wimp. I also tend to react very easily to things) and have gone through this with no burning sensations_ absolute no side-effects like the flu symptoms and/or headaches etc. aside expected sensitivity and by the first week of use I noticed a considerable difference.DOSAGE:I do not know if the frequency with which people are using it is what is causing problems but I will note what I did;-3 times per week on alternating days e.g. Monday_ Wednesday and Friday-Left on for no less than 6 hours and no longer than 10 (I always left it on for 8-10)-The first week I used it certain areas got very sensitive so I put off using it for a week (perhaps leaving it for a week let it do its work instead of bombarding my system)-After the week of rest I went back to using it for a week_ then left it for TWO weeks due to sensitivity(Warts are all practically gone by this point except a tiny remnant)I have now just finished the three sachets for the third week of treatment and am wart-free.Do take into account that people,F,22,3  weeks250mg 3X W,8/15/2015,Aldara
27, 1, Genital Warts,Worst pain in my entire life. If you are reading this and your doctors have given you this do not put this on your genitals. Myself and my boyfriend have had flu like symptoms and then severe burns on our genitals. I cannot pee or walk or even sit without being in pain. I have been prescribed numbing gel from my doctor yet this has only caused more stinging. On inspection I have noticed blisters forming that are now unbarable in any position. It is ruining my life. I would rather suffer with the warts than go through this again. DO NOT USE ALDARA. Instead go through cryotherphy which is what I intend to do when or if my vulva returns to normal. This virus has affected me hugely and after thinking I was going to be cured and instead slammed me with these excruiciating,pains_ is heartbreaking. NEVER USE ALDARA. Even as sparingly as I did it has taken 3 applications with more than 4 days inbetween each one for this 'cure' to ruin my vagina. DO NOT USE this_ it is not worth the risk. Go for freezing the warts_ that pain is minute compared to what I am feeling.,,20,  3X W,7/15/2015,Aldara
28, 5, HPV Genital Warts,I had some swelling and minor irritation/redness near my labia (burning) but nothing unbearable like many of the testimonials I read prior to starting the drug. The key is to use a TINY amount on the tip of a Q-tip or toothpick and applying it SPARINGLY to the wart. I sit with my legs spread open so it has time to dry and won't spread to other unaffected areas.,This is 100% a miracle cream. I had about 4 GWs and was mortified at their formation. I applied before bed 3x weekly (every other day) and all GWs miraculously disappeared within 2 weeks - about 6 applications. Thankfully I have a drug plan that covered the entire cost because I hear it is extremely expensive when purchased outright. Even if you have to purchase it you can get by on very few packets if you use sparingly. I was GW free for 5 months and just noticed 2 new ones appear_ so am restarting treatment with leftover packets (that aren't expired). I'm hopeful that their disappearance will be just as fast as last time.,F,27,3  weeks30mg 3X W,7/6/2015,Aldara
29, 5, GW,Burning_ Itchy_ flu like symptoms,I promised myself that I would write here if it all went well because I like to be positive! And for anyone that is about to use this cream for GW please know that it will be painful but it will be worth it!!! I saw a reduction of the warts immediately. I obviously put too much cream since I was desperate to get rid of them and got horrible flu like symptoms but I just went on about my day because I figured it was the cream and normally you get a fever when you have a cold to kill the virus (that's the bodies mechanism) so in a weird way I was happy I was having side effects it meant it was working! At times I got discouraged because I felt like they would come back. I had to skip some of the treatments since my genial area was on fire super swollen and burned so bad_ I knew adding more cream would cause other serious problems down there. So I would put desitin and that would help a lot. Since most of the warts had cleared up I only used a little bit of cream only on the warts but to be honest I would put it all over to be safe. I figured out a way to help the rest of the skin not to get hurt by the cream so I would break a cotton ball and line it around the inside of my v*** so that only the lips had the cream on. In a month or so I am all cleared!!! I never gave up and even when I could barely see them I still finished the whole treatment.,F,25,1  months,6/25/2015,Aldara

31, 3, GW,Chemical burns - very painful,I saw a lot of comments here and wanted to help. Doctors should be advising to administer very tiny amounts to the specific areas - use a cotton bud. If you mess up and apply too much it could be very painful. If you have a lot of pain and chemical burn situation you need to stop using it until it clears up. A lot people have been asking what they can do to speed up healing for the chemical burns they got from Aldara. I bathed the area in salt water 2 or 3 times a day and put aloe gel (not cream) on the area. This REALLY helped. For a while I was really worried and freaking out. The GWs all cleared up. The whole experience has been pretty terrible - the pain of chemical burns is unimaginable. Luckily it wasn't as bad as some of the situations I read about here. You have to be SO CAREFUL with this stuff. If you start getting burns STOP USING IT. Use Aloe gel to soothe the pain and accelerate healing. If you still need to use the Aldara be very careful and be sure to use only on the GWs in very small amounts.,M,25,7  days1MG 3X W,6/20/2015,Aldara

Joint pain_ runny nose_ occasional insomnia that is unaffected by Lunesta and clonipan_ hives on untreated areas.,I am using Aldara on two large BCC areas_ one on the left shoulder and one on the right back/shoulder areas. The left shoulder is where I have had the most problems. The original bcc was approximately 6cm by 6 cm. the inflamed and areas of rash now covers an area of 12.5 x 12.5. I have a number of other medical issues including recent surgery for a double inguinal hernia_ a number of other bccs that have been removed by MOHs and other conventional surgical procedures. I am also on various medications for PTSD and severe major depression and elevated cholesterol (something new but probably attributable to non- Aldara medications). Recently I have suffered occasional insomnia_ a previous issue taken care of by medication_ but the new bought_ if caused by Aldara_ defeats all sleeping meds.  I have also recently begun experiencing joint and hip pain. My dermatologist keeps telling me to keep the affected areas covered in Vaseline_ but this seems to exacerbate the problem. My main concern with the amount of Aldara I use Dailey (2 packets/ .5 grams) that I I may suffer permanent side effects. I am willing to continue because_ if it works_ it will allow me to avoid surgery and grafting in a difficult location. I will update this blog after my remains 2 to 3 month therapy remaining.

42, 1, Vulvar dysplasia from HPV,I was prescribed aldara for mild vulvar dysplasia causing painful intercourse. I was having painful intercourse with my husband and went to the GYN. She did a bopsy and said I have mild vaginal dysplasia caused by HPV. I had no warts or lesions. She prescribed aldara to the area of biopsy/pain 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The only thing she told me was to wash it off after 8-10 hours with mild soap because it can cause irritation. After I had used aldara for 3 applications_ I had a severe headache_ fever_ body aches_ and fatigue. I thought I had a virus so I kept using it.

43, 5, AK,Redness_ overnight itching on application nights_ burning_ sores and scabs in infected areas,I just completed the whole 16 week regimen. It seems_ for me_ there was a big response in the earlier weeks with overall redness and scabbing quite pronounced. After the tenth week or so_ the skin was mostly soft and healed_ with smaller sections around the fringes still reacting (perhaps due to spreading the medicine more after the worst areas were cleared). The last four weeks or so were pretty much a non-event. The skin areas that were affected are cosmetically nicer than before; but_ more importantly_ the AKs are gone. Time will tell how long this will last_ but at least the few scaly growths are not present. Clearly_ some seem to bail early in the treatment. I would encourage you to tough it out as the end is worth the inconvenience.,M,55,16  weeks 2X W,10/24/2014,Aldara
44, 1, Molluscum,I applied this to my genital area and literally have sores down there now from this medicine. They are so painful that I can't get out of bed and I take 800 mg of ibuprofen during the day and Hydrocodon to sleep. I would much rather just have the molluscum and wait for a derm treatment.,The molluscum is gone_ but it seems like this medication worked a little too well!,F,19,1  weeks.25 mg 5X W,10/20/2014,Aldara
45, 2, Genital warts,I'm having a horrible experience with aldara. I partly blame the doctor for this. I got diagnosed with genital warts over a month ago and they tried freezing a couple of times which didn't do anything_ so they gave me the cream. I got told to put the cream on 3 nights in a row every week and to put it 'all over' and was not warned of any side effects. I'm now in agony having one of the worst experience of my life. But i know it's because i've been using it wrong_ clearly i have overdosed now i'm suffering extreme pain_ can't move from my bed had to call in sick at work_ i can't pee_ they are oozing liquid and it smells horrible. PLEASE make sure you use it correctly_ i had no idea this would happen nor the importance of not overdosing. Apparently this is a sign it is working in fighting the virus though_ i plan on leaving it for a coupl or weeks till it settles then going back to it correctly_ so it may work yet.,,F,19,7  days,10/5/2014,Aldara
46, 5, Genital warts,3 weeks using Aldara now. Skipped a couple doses in the middle due to soreness. Wasn't bad at all_ just being extra cautious considering all the horror stories on here. I'm applying 3 nights a week. Had prob fifteen perianal warts_  a few quite large. As of last night I have 2 tiny warts left. All the others are GONE. THIS STUFF Works. Just don't get greedy and slather the stuff on any more than 3 nights a week or you're running the risk of some serious side effects. Be patient_ use common sense_ take a break if needed_ and this stuff works wonders.,,M,27,3  weeks,9/23/2014,Aldara
47, 5, AK,Redness_ sores_ scabbing on forehead_ cheeks and around eyebrows (treated areas). Earlier weeks_ when the response was more pronounced_ general fatigue the day after application.,I was originally hesitant to use_ based on some of what I read about side effects. Clearly_ the first six to seven weeks were rough. But_ I just kept going since I understood that the more the visual signs_ the more the hidden damage that was being exposed. Truth be told_ I shudder to think about all of those ticking time bombs that were not visible (there were perhaps three visible AK areas before I started treatment and the treatment exposed dozens more). For those that may be interested_ the payoff at the end is clearly the end of those abnormal cells. But_ for those that may be interested_ if you continue on the treatment_ you will have soft_ baby like skin after the regimen. I can't say it's been a panacea to me_ but my wife loves touching the soft skin now. Basically_ there is a cosmetic upside that some would consider worth the pain by itself. Would do this again.,M,55,16  weeks 2X W,9/22/2014,Aldara
48, 5, GWs,Irritation in treatment area. Oozing of clear fluid. Muscle aches.,It's me again! One of the things I hated when reading was people who posted during their first couple weeks and stopped. I wanted to hear from people thru the whole treatment. So I decided I will do that. I am now at 7 weeks. All of the original warts are gone. I have a appt with Doc next week. He gave me no instructions to stop before then so I won't. The treatment area expanded as time went on because as areas got red on the perimeter of the treatment area I expanded the area thinking there was virus there. I now have a large treatment area and it is inflamed but not unbearable. There is oozing of clear liquid from some spots. Lots of dry skin and pealing. On treatment day I soak in the pool and then use my finger and literally scrape the dead skin away prior to new treatment. I believe I am wart free now but will post after my doctor appt and again later to let you know about the healing process.,M,55,7  weeks 3X W,9/15/2014,Aldara
49, 1, BCC,Pain_ severe flu like symptoms_ exhaustion_ back pain_ headache,Would NEVER use Aldara again! Diagnosed with a bcc on my chest_ I was prescribed this with no mention of side effects other than scabbing at application site. Applied for 5 days on_ 2 days off. At week 3 started to feel unwell_ by week 5 I felt like death. Went back to the doctor who discontinued use. I have been off it for a week now but still the flu like symptoms persist- if anything they are getting worse. Extreme fatigue and body aches and very teary_ not like me at all. To anyone considering using this cream_ do so with extreme caution. I am hoping my symptoms subside.,F,48,6  weeks5mg 1X D,9/10/2014Email,Aldara
50, 5, GW,I started using aldara cream on Monday for genital warts_ I have quite a few small warts like skin tags on different areas of my vagina. I wanted to write this review to give others some hope_ because I know when I got diagnosed I didn't have any hope at all. After seeing various doctors and reading a lot online I've come to the conclusion that hpv isn't for life. If you have a healthy diet and strong immune system then you can get rid of this virus quite easily_ yes it may take time and it may return but it isn't forever! I used the aldara on Monday and Wednesday_ today is now Friday and I have my 3rd treatment tonight. Slight burning but nothing major. I think the trick is to only apply a tiny bit of the cream_ if you use too much you'll have bad burning and itching(used too much on Monday) my warts have gone down massively in the few days that I've used this cream_ if the treatment continues to work like this I would gladly recommend this cream to anyone! I also starting taking immune system enhancers which I assume are helping too. If it isn't working as fast for you then I advice to stick with it_ finish the 4 week treatment and see what the doctor has to say after that.,,F,21,4  days3 per week,9/5/2014,Aldara
51, 5, GWs,Side effects started to subside after 3 weeks. Only had sore and inflamed skin.,I'm the one who wrote on 8/20. It is now one week later. All of the warts are either gone or crusted up and are days from being gone. In the last week something interesting happened. That is that the skin is no longer sensitive and painful. It is almost as if it is healing during treatment. The areas where the warts were is still red or purple. But the warts seem to be gone. So for me it was 3 weeks of discomfort and then it went away. My follow up with the doc is in 4 weeks. He never said I could stop before then so I guess I will just continue the treatments up to 4-5 days before the appt and let everything heal so he can get a good look. At this time I believe that I'll be clear at 5 weeks and the doc will suspend treatment at 8 weeks.,M,55,4  weeks 3X W,8/27/2014,Aldara
52, 4, GWs,Soreness around coverage area.,Today is exactly 3 weeks for me. I have a few warts in a cluster on the scrotum and then 2 other areas on the shaft with a cluster of 4-5 warts. The redness and tenderness was certainly uncomfortable but not as much misery as others have said. After the 2nd application the skin under the treated areas literally pealed off leaving the underneath very raw. I waited 3 days and let it heal then resumed and at this point the areas are red and tender but the warts are diminishing. All of the warts are black scabs or have disappeared.  The thing I did notice however was that I would develop red/purple areas in places that weren't being treated. My doc said this stuff goes into the skin and surrounding skin so I guess I wasn't surprised to see this. I think this may be what other's have said that more warts developed on this treatment. I don't think these are warts but possibly areas of the virus where future warts would develop. The areas were never raised and I could not feel a bump. Just a red or purple area about the size of a pimple. There are about a dozen of these and I expect them to clear up during or shortly after treatment.My doctor said this was a 16 week treatment but then as I was leaving he said 16 weeks or shorter. I have a appointment at 8 weeks_ 5 weeks from today_ but as I look at the progress so far and read others who said 3-4 weeks cleared it up_ I'm not sure if I should stop when I see no more warts or continue putting this stuff on.,M,55,3  weeks 3X W,8/20/2014,Aldara

55, 5, Basal Cell Carcinoma,Nothing unusual/distressing. I had one large BCC at the bridge of my nose. I used Aldara daily (overnight) for six weeks (five days on_ two days off) and it cleared up leaving only a tiny scar on my nose.I've just finished using all over my face for solar ketosis (3 days of treatment_ applied in the evening) and again_ I've not experienced any bad side effects. The cream has bought up three spots on my nose and also a few on the tops of my cheeks. These have healed without issue.,After reading all the comments on this blog I was concerned that my treatment would be difficult. My experience has been really good. BCC's are gone and no side effects. I'd highly recommend.,F,32,6  weeks 1X D,6/9/2014Email,Aldara

I used it 3 times a week with rest day in between and all that happened after 3 weeks was the area turned a healthy colour as my good skin_ but the biopsy site looks red and though not open appears to be affected by the cream.
