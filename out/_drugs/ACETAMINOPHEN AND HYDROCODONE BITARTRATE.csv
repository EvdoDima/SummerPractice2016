0, 4, Tonsillectomy and kidney stones,Nausea_ insomnia,I was on this twice--once for a tonsillectomy and another for kidney stones. It did knock out my pain_ but it wore off in 3 hours and I was only allowed to take one pill every 6 hours so that was not fun. It made me very nauseous_ so I took it with some Zofran prescribed by my doctor. It also made me unable to sleep--I tossed and turned while on it and had to take a sleeping pill to drift off. I know it was this drug causing it because it did it both times I took it and stopped once I got off of it.,M,29,2  weeksN/A 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Acetaminophen and hydrocodone bitartrate
