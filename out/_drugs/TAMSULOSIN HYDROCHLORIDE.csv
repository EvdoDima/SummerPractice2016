0, 1, BPH,tooth pain_ retrograde ejaculation,The medicine definitely improved urine flow_ but after about 2 months I developed some tooth sensitivity_ localized upper left quadrant. Dental x-rays showed no structural problem. After 4 months that pain increased and was intense at times. For some days I was eating a lot of ibuprophen. Discontinued Flomax now for about 2 weeks. Pain has definitely lessened but not completely gone away at this point.,M,55,4  months.4 mg 1X D,12/21/2015,Tamsulosin hydrochloride
