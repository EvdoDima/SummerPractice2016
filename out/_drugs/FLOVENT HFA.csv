0, 1, COPD,I caught a cold aggrevating the COPD. So it was a new prescription. Symptoms came on gradually_ by the 3rd day I was extremely irritated for no reason. I felt angry for nothing. I figured it was the new drug. I quit taking it 2 days ago and am exhausted but no longer angry or irritated.,Side effects not worth it.,F,57,6  days1 puff 2x,5/14/2015,Flovent hfa
1, 1, Newly diagnosed adult asthma,Extreme worsening of asthma symptoms--shortness of breath_ chest pain_ sleep disturbance. Did not happen immediately after dose--woke up with symptoms in the morning. Ended up in ER and back on oral steroids.,This side effect is not uncommon_ yet my doc acted as if I were the only freak this ever happened to. I finally stopped taking it (against her advice) and the symptoms gradually went away. I no longer see this physician.,M,54,6  days440 mcg 2X D,3/16/2014Email,Flovent hfa
2, 5, Asthma,None_ Have been using this medicine for over a decade_ I take 1 puff in the morning and I'm good for the day_ maybe once or twice a year I use my rescue inhaler_ The doctor tells me to take 2 puffs 2 times a day_ but I don't need to use more than what I feel my body needs.,,F,46,12  years110 mg 1X D,5/20/2013,Flovent hfa
3, 4, asthma,flovent works good_but you have to take it regulary for it to work.I have no side effects from this medicine.I think most of the side effects that some of the people are talking about would disappear once the body adjusted to the medicine.,,M,51,10  years220 2X D,4/1/2013Email,Flovent hfa
4, 1, Asthma like symptoms,I began Flovent at around 5PM the first night. I took my second dose around 7AM the next morning_ and by the time I was at work at 9AM I was feel tingly_ my heartbeat was 96_ I was coughing_ I had a lump in my throat_ and I was fatigued and dizzy. It got so bad I had to tell my boss I was leaving. I almost started crying when I told him_ which was very strange_ because while I was concerned about my condition_ I was in no way upset or sad_ but I couldn't seem to control my emotions. I spent the rest of the day at home_ sitting in a chair_ feeling totally out of it. Scary stuff...,,F,60,2  times88 mcg. 2X D,3/5/2013,Flovent hfa
5, 1, asthma,Made me irritable/depressed and sad. This came on gradually over several days.,Since this drug doesn't seem to do much for asthma I don't think I'll use it. The degree of help is not worth the side effects_ which are pretty spooky.,F,58,3  days 1X D,1/31/2013,Flovent hfa
6, 3, Asthma,Sadness_ depression,My otherwise happy go lucky 12yr old_ who has been on this medicine about 18months_ has recently become depressed_ and cannot explain why he feels this way. There have been no recent events in his life to cause these feelings_ and the only medicine he takes regularly is Flovent HFA. After doing some research online_ it seems that although this wasn't one of the reported symptoms in the clinical trial_ many people have reported depression as a side effect of this medication. I have called his respiratory specialist and asked for another medication.,M,12,18  months44mcg 2X D,8/9/2012Email,Flovent hfa
7, 5, Chronic Acute Asthma,occasionally lost voice and had oral thrush once,I didn't rinse my mouth or use a spacer all the time_ that is why these things happened...but also my doctor reduced my dosage to the least amount and it still works well.  Before Flovent_ I had to be on a prednisone burst once a month.  Now I only need prednisone maybe twice a year if I have a bad virus or if I'm around an allergy trigger for too long.,F,37,15  years44 mcg 1X D,7/13/2012Email,Flovent hfa
8, 1, virus-induced asthma,SOBBINGcrying all nightwaking up each hour at nightsadnessweepingcrying all night long after only one puff of this drug,My son has mild asthma_ wheezing for just 2 days after an upper respiratory tract infection. He was prescribed Flovent HFA. I was very worried about giving this to him_ based on all of the possible side effects. But after a lot of pressure from his doctors_ I decided to start slowly and give him just one puff (44 mcg) yesterday morning to start. He had a pretty normal day_ maybe a little bit more clingy and irritable_ but no problem. He went to bed fine for bedtime_ but he then woke up each hour ALL NIGHT LONG_ SOBBING. He was just weeping_ inconsolable. I have never seen my son like this before. He is such an easy-going boy who never complains. Even when he is teething all of his molars and in the middle of a bad cold_ he does not cry and sleeps through the entire night. Last night_ after just ONE PUFF of Flovent in the morning_ he had the WORST NIGHT OF HIS LIFE. He woke up each hour inconsolably crying for 45 minutes until we could console him back to sleep_ just to wake up again a little bit later WEEPING. Flovent is a HORRENDOUS medication. What kind of poison must be in this drug to cause such a horrible reaction after just ONE PUFF ?!!!! I will never give my son this medication again.,M,1.5,1  days44 mcg 1X D,3/27/2012Email,Flovent hfa
9, 4, Asthma,I have had no negative side effects except a slight metallic taste in my mouth sometimes.  Of course_ you are supposed to rinse out your mouth after each inhalation.,I had my allergy doctor switch me from Advair to Flovent (since Flovent does not contain a Long-acting Bronchodilator).  An LABD can cause heart failure_ so needless to say that was a concern.  Advair has both an LABD and a corticosteroid.  Flovent just has a corticosteroid_ which I felt more comfortable with.,M,49,30  days110 mcg. 2X D,10/25/2011,Flovent hfa
