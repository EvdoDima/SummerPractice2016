0, 1, anxiety,Extreme thirst and dry mouth_ very agitated_ couldn't sit still. poor sleep. horrible taste in mouth_  food tasted metalic and no way could you even enjoy one glass of wine w/out falling over.  Also you could even smell the chemicals going through my blood via no nostrils.  Drug haze thinking and vision. Confusion. Bad trip.,I had anxiety and it was very disruptive in my life.  Tried all other things like meditation etc but didn't seem to work.  My doctor said try this it should really help.  WRONG Now I'm trying to withdraw from this drug after only 7 days. It may be just that I can't tolerate this medication.,M,67,1  weeks5mg 4X D,11/16/2013Email,Buspirone hydrochloride
