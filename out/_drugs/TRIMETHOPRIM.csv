Twenty minutes later my eyelids started to puff up_ then a blistering stinging rash started to develop on my legs and arms and was shortly followed by a swollen tongue and blistering on my lips.  I think my body recognised this as the toxic poison that it actually is.  I realised this is not a side effect. It was the effect of digesting toxic chemicals_ namely trimethoprim.,I think my body recognised this as the toxic poison that it actually is.  I realised this is not a side effect.

Feeling very unwell_ I get the medical appointment and start on the medicine only to find it does not really work. Maybe it slows the infection_  I am not sure.  I have then suffered a very unpleasant 3 days_ before getting a further medical appointment to be put on a different antibiotic,M,59, 200 2X D,10/20/2012,Trimethoprim
