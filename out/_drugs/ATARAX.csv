8, 4, Hives (To help sleep and itch),Was originally to help w/ itch from hives. I have insomnia and WOW this drug has made such a difference. Doctor prescribed two scripts of it during my 1 month of hives. Just taking one a night until I run out and it helps immensely just getting me to sleep. I just need that extra help falling asleep. I'd say it helps with sleep quality as well. Very satisfied.,I had zero side effects other than the purpose the drug was created.,F,21,2  months25mg,6/9/2015,Atarax

11, 5, allergies/anxiety combined,sedative effect upon talking- however the best medication by far I have ever been described.

16, 1, bipolar anxiety_ sleep problems,diarrhea_ vomiting confused with gastro-enteritis_ no sleeping enhancive_ occulaire adjustments_ blurred vision_ state of confusion_ itchy dermatitis,I knew that I was Atarax non-responsive (as well as one of my son's).  We could drink an entire bottle and not experience any benefit to our problems.  We would only be stuck with the side effects.  I knew that if Atarax had no effect within the 24 hours following the initial dose_ to stop it right away.  I'm a doctor_ but that had no effect on my treatment. I pleaded with the psychiatrists to stop giving me Atarax (because it was the only meds that they put me on)_ but they refused_ so I was stuck on it_ until I played the game_ and told them that I was much better_ and they let me go.  My whole body has become a playground for Atarax.

23, 1, anxiety_ sleeplessness,I was actually prescribed Atarax syrup to take to help treat anxiety and sleeplessness that I was experiencing. This syrup smells awful_ tastes_ awful_ and all this medicine did was upset my stomach. If you have bad anxiety problems along with insomnia and a doctor tries to prescribe you this stuff_ just say no! I sure which I had.

It has been a very good drug for me but it makes me drowsy but only when I take it sometimes if I take regularly the I don't get drowsy. It helps a lot calms my skin down if itchy. I would recommend this to exzeema who suffers from a lot of itching.going abroad to hot countries also helps. I was the worse case bandages being hospitalised and the lot if you are bad then get dr to refer you to st Thomas hospital in Westminster it is one of the best hospitals with all the good doctors in dermatology. My daughter had exzeema aswell by taking her to a hot country Pakistan really cured her exzeema. I'm still taking atarax but only if needed and no more scratching at nights for me cause I'm partially cured in not as bad I used to be. I hope this helps. ,,F,33,10  years10mg,11/7/2013Email,Atarax

I know this medicine also treats itching so was wondering if it suppressed my itching even though I didn't need it for that and now that I'm done with it my body is going through withdrawal and itching a lot?

27, 1, hives,I was first given a shot of Visteril at hospital after a week of predisone (20 mg)and my hives were returning. I was pissed they gave it to me_ I felt like I could barely walk and I had to drive home. The initial effect wore off then I was wide awake all night (shot was at 7pm) I filled the script the next day_ took it one day_ still had the loopy feeling at first then decided to quit taking it. Two days later I quit the prednisone. I had horrible muscle pains_ bouts of depression and anxiety_ chest pains_ ringing in my ears_ nausea_ no appetite and lost 9lbs in a week. I thought it was all due to the prednisone_ then tried the visteril again after a week off the prednisone and didn't get the severe loopy feeling so I thought it was because of the prednisone. It helped with the itch due to hives coming back in full force but now after reading all the side effects from others on here. I can honestly say what I thought was prednisone withdrawal is now from the visteril. I even last week got a script for 25 mg of attarax. Took it last week up until yesterday. Then decided to quit taking them. I have severe muscle tension_ zaps in my back_ head and calfs_ only 4 hours of sleep and still wide awake. Alot of nervousness and worry. I would really like to know of these symptoms will work themselves out. I can say I would rather be up all night putting cold copresses on hives than deal with these side effects.

I lost my desire to exercise and experienced a significantly increased appetite.,Without medication I normally have terrible interrupted sleep_ so i tried Atarax.

But looking back_ I see that Atarax helped me a lot with the skin rash and pruritis_ although these symptomes appear only when I am awake and don't disturb my sleeping behavior as well as Atarax. Do I recommend it? of course yes_ but just for a short period and not in an exessive way. Try to find out why you can't sleep in stead of handing the problem to Atarax.

34, 1, I was taking Atarax for anxiety.,"I am going to try and explain in my own words what this new ""pill"" that I was going to be taking was supposed to help me with. Ok I guess when I committed my self to the hospital they started me on Atarax. I wasn't ever even told I was put on a nrw medication. When I found that out I was kind of upset. I thought to myself what did they put me on? But at that time it was working. So I said to my doctor well I guess_its working. Because when I first started the new pill it was working. Ok so then I was feeling good with Atarax. Then after I got out of being watched while I was taking it. Got out of the hospital I felt fine. Then it started that whatever that this med. Was the I just started taking was different. This new med was not the same. It made me laugh that new pill Atarax it made me sit there from the first I took it to my friends that were nice people I thought and that pill was not that right medication for me.  I would take it and then I would loose it. I would sit there a laugh about nothing. If this happen to anyone else please let me know",,F,26,4  weeks25mg 3x da,8/15/2012,Atarax
35, 5, Severe Itching,Drowsiness (which was the point)_ difficulty waking up in the morning,I love Atarax. I am taking it for a severe itch that no doctor has been able to figure out. I've been itching for 6 months now_ and wasn't able to sleep at night because the itch was so extreme_ I'd wake up in tears after less than an hour of sleep. With the help of atarax_ I'm able to get a full night's sleep. Waking up is difficult_ but I'd rather have that problem than the itchiness and lack of sleep. Unfortunately_ until they figure out why I'm itching and find a way to fix it for sure_ I'm going to be taking these on a nightly basis.,F,24,2  months25 1X D,8/12/2012Email,Atarax

37, 5, Allergies,None,Have suffered with horrible seasonal allergies. I made an appointment with an allergist for testing. I'm off the charts for seasonal allergies and indoor dust mites. She prescribed Nasonex along with irrigating my sinuses once a day in the morning. I also covered my mattress and pillows with protective covers to prevent dust mites. She also prescribed Atarax for bedtime. It works fantastic. I've never had a better night's sleep and I feel great in the morning. Wonderful drug!,M,64,14  days25 MG 1X D,8/5/2012Email,Atarax
38, 3, Hives,,"Hoping to dispel misinformation. 7 days ago I had a bad food allergic rxn. Bottom of my feet to the top of my head_ worst on torso.  Was prescribed Atarax + 40mg Prednisone/day.  First 24 hrs: no change. After reading on sites like this about people having hives disappear in 24 hrs on Atarax_ I started to worry. Even doubled up on the Atarax dose once.  48 hrs: went back to the doctor because my experience wasn't matching what I saw on the internet (this is why health care costs are rising).  The (2nd) doctor explained two important things: First_ ATARAX DOES NOT MAKE HIVES GO AWAY FASTER. It only helps with the itchiness_ and if I didn't need it for that_ I should stop taking it. I confirmed this with the pharmacist.  Second_ the only things that DO make hives disappear is a) Prednisone and b) time.  I stopped taking the Atarax at that point. End of the third day: started seeing real_ substantial fading_ especially on my extremities. Days 4-5: people wouldn't notice the marks unless I pointed them out. Day 6-7: pinkness barely noticeable everywhere except my chest (because of the sheer quantity that had been there). I liken the recovery time to that for acne. Hope this helps someone! Vowed I'd come back and follow up_ unlike people posting ""just started_ hope this works"" and never reporting back.

Once my body became used to the medicine (about a week) I didn't notice side effects much_ anymore.,I'm not sure it's helping the angioedema (which doesn't come and go; it's been pretty constant) - the side effects are MUCH easier for me to handle than claritin and it makes me less drowsy than benadryl.  I'm pretty sensitive to medications_ but my experience with atarax has been a good one so far.  It's also helped with underlying anxiety even though I'm on a fairly low dosage.  If my anxiety gets worse_ I would be willing to take a higher dose of atarax to treat it because this does not cause dependency like some other anxiety meds I've tried in the past.,F,33,3  months10mg 3X D,3/16/2012,Atarax

I did have a nightmare that nite_ maybe a coincidence.,After a first time bout of hives lasting on and off for about 7 weeks_ and finding only minimal relief from Benadryl_ oatmeal baths_ calamine etc._  I got a prescription for 10 mg of Atarax. I took it once and slept through the night without staying awake from intense itching. The next morning I felt a touch groggy but so grateful to not have any itching. I did not take another dose because there was no renewed itching and the size of the existing hives on my body was starting to shrink.  I did not get any new hives after this first dose.

46, 3, Itching,Nothing for over 40 years (other than drowsiness) then post menopause_ its drying effect was bad on my complexion.  So I stopped cold turkey OMG!,For a few months after stopping abruptly (an idiot move in retrospect) last April_ the insomina was horrid for a few months.  That resolved.  But what's followed has been a nightmare.  The ringing in my years is so noteworthy_ I have to attempt to talk over it.   I never had anxiety before (a mental brick) now I feel close to panic for no reason. I'll wake up with dread. My resting pulse rate has gone from around 65 to 120 (that's upon waking!).   My heart will pound_ my pulse will roar through my extremities_ throbbing unmercifully. I can go on_ but you get the idea.  It was so bad_ I had all my hormone levels checked.   I had a thyroidectomy in the early '60s so I watch that regularly and take dessicated natural hormone replacement.   Over 9 moths later_  blood levels are all normal_ and clearly I am not. I have no other underlying health issues.  How long will this last?! (the rhetorical cry of the damned)  I'm wondering whether to start back on a very low dose (like splitting the pills to 2 or 5 mg) but I'd rather not.    I'll watch this site for any signs of encouragement (OK_ that may be wishful thinking-- even documented discouragement will do.)  I can't find anything to replicate my experience online.

Is this a true sympton of this drug_ because emotionally it has helped me so much and also with my allergies..thank you,Would like very much to continue to take but..tha joint pain does seem to be related to this 10 Mg pill,F,69,25  days10 mg 1X D,5/24/2010Email,Atarax
