0, 5, folliculitis_ topical itching,,I don't use this regularly_ but keep it for when I have reactions to things (I am allergic to many substances and am prone to folliculitis flare ups_ esp. During times of stress).  This is a miracle for itching.  Doesn't even compare to over the counter hydrocortisone_ which does nothing for me.,F,29,2  years 1X D,2/26/2014Email,Temovate
1, 4, Scalp psoriasis,Slight tingle when applying to the areas on scalp,This really hepled with the itchy_ flaking in about 3 days!! Now I use a couple of times a week to help with the flares.,F,49,2  months30 1X D,1/21/2011,Temovate
2, 2, Eczema,After 5 days of application (twice a day)_ caused an allergic skin reaction: painful and itchy blisters. Doctor prescribed antihistamine (with side effect of somnolence/drowsiness) subsequently but no additional topical treatment. Skin blisters became dry_ scaly_ ugly-looking subsequently.,Hopefully_ with the anti-histamine the allergic reaction shall subside. Will need a more effective treatment for the original problem of eczema.,M,36,5  days,10/27/2007,Temovate
3, 2, seborrheic dermatitis,peeling_ itchiness_ oiliness in skin_ acne on my scalp,way too strong_ get rid of the dermatitis fast_ but it creates more problems that looks like it invites the psoriasis to come back. Temovate made matters on my scalp worse. Better to go with a medium potency whenever possible.,M,30,2  years,10/28/2004,Temovate
