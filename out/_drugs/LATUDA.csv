0, 1, Bi polar,Anxiety especially 1to 2 hrs after taken. Dr. Kept upping dose to 80mg. Involuntary muscle jaw movement @ 80. Reduced dose with continued anxiety slight tremor noticed by internal med. psych said stop it. Fortunately I had read patient responses to taper & it was still difficult to get off. Off 1 month no panic attacks which were not a problem pre Latuda. Thank God tremor not permanent,Some reviews say miracle drug which is fantastic. I post worse drug I've ever been on because it was patient reviews that made me connect the dots on how terrible this drug was for me & to taper off,F,56,1  yearsUp to 80mg,8/14/2016,Latuda
1, 3, Severe anxiety_ psychotic features,I was very tired after taking this after dinner. I was shaky and trembling  on it_ and I my leg muscles felt weak_ like I almost couldn't or didn't want to walk to places. It helped in some ways with my anxiety and social withdrawal. I felt faint on it_ and I had my blood pressure checked and it was low_ which isn't normal for me- I always have normal or high blood pressure and I take high blood pressure pills. Always sleepy_ and just wanting to stay in bed and sleep. I noticed people would get red around me_ like being around me on this med increased their blood pressure.,It helped me in ways with my anxiety (I was able to walk across a crowded shopping center to get a Smoothie- this I would normally never do). I only took it for 1 week_ as per the directions of my psychiatrist_ and I wonder if I should have taken it longer_ for at least 2 weeks_ to see if my body and mind adjusted better to the side effects. I also didn't like always feeling weak and faint on it; I would be walking somewhere and feel faint and a little nauseaus_ almost like I was going to pass out_ but this could have also been due to my anxiety_ which it also heightened in some ways. I'm unsure if these side effects would have gone away if I gave it more time.,F,33,7  days20 mg 1X D,7/23/2016Email,Latuda

3, 1, anxiety or ?? who knows?,1/2 hours of feeling good_ perhaps an hour_ and that night I ended up in the emergency room,Expensive. A brief window of experience that made me think this was finally a good drug to help me. Then_ a few hours later_ cardiology symptoms that made it necessary to go to the emergency room.

5, 2, Bipolar Disorder Type 1,Latuda made my heart beat pretty fast it made me feel like I was overheating it is always cold in our flat yet my neck and back would be so sweaty they stated it makes you feel drowsy until your body gets used to it but that's not the case with me it made me yawn and feel drowsy constantly no matter the time I'd take it do you know how annoying it is when your body isn't tired but your mind thinks it is? Also it caused me to shiver constantly my teeth were always chattering that's annoying as heck too I'd have to take the medicine my psychologist prescribed me for anxiety_tremors and shivers to help get rid of the teeth chattering I'd have to walk or take a shower or read a book to occupy my mind it made my anxiety worse and don't get me started on the akathisia it got so bad once that the ambulance had to come get me and the hospital had to help me get some sleep they thought I was trying to harm myself again I've recently flushed it down the loo cause I can't take the horrible side effects any more. I would rather deal with my bipolar disorder the way I was before I got on latuda.,If your doctor suggests this to do not accept ask them is there anything else they can give you the medication sucks and should have been approved by the FDA.,M,23,2  months20 MG,6/24/2016,Latuda

Cold chills and hot flashes.,I am very sensitive to medicines but I thought I would give it a try. After day 2 of taking the medicine all of my side effects became extremely worse and I had to go to the e.r. The muscle pains_ nasea_ and vomiting were so bad I didn't know what to do except cry. I am now taking medicine for the nasea and pain until that subsides.,F,25,2  days20 mg,6/18/2016Email,Latuda
7, 1, Bipolar I and PTSD,Extreme diarrhea!! I read a ton of reviews_ I had really high hopes for this medication. It has been a nightmare. Jittery_ on edge_ ringing in ears_ restless legs_ and diarrhea. I finally gave up after 3 days and switched back to Seraquel. I'm still feeling the side effects of Latuda. I read it takes four days for the medication to be completely out of your system. Please be careful when talking this. Talk to your doctor about all of the side effects.,,F,27,3  days25MG,6/14/2016,Latuda
8, 3, PTSD AND PREGNANCY,Weird feeling in my legs and feet _ restlessness_ sometimes racing breathing like I wanna go for a run,Huge help only safe one for me to take in my pregnancy_ only reason why I give this a less rating is because the leg thing is unbearable. Seems to get worse as the dose increases. I can't tell if the crying spells are Latuda or pregnancy but it's for no good reason it doesn't make me more depressed just makes me cry,F,20,3  weeks40 mg,5/23/2016,Latuda

10, 2, to help with depression,I've been off and on this since last fall about. 20mg at dinner_ then it takes forever to sleep_ next day I feel sedated and drugged_ a hangover feeling and all I want to do is sleep_ this is not good to enjoy life_ and its the lowest dose. I'm cutting it in half tonite to see. I only take cymbalta at am. So what is my problem and what should I do? Maybe its not for me.,Any comments would be appreciated,F,58,5  months20 mg,5/7/2016Email,Latuda
11, 2, Bipolar 1,Extreme nausea_ trouble sleeping,I take it at night and within the hour it makes me sleepy but I wake up during the night a lot feeling restless_ and I am constantly waking up at 5 unable to go back to sleep. The nausea is terrible_ I mean I slept in the bathroom last night so I could have easy access to the toilet. I haven't been taking it very long but the nausea is unbearable.,F,21,5  days20 MG,5/5/2016,Latuda
12, 5, PTSD,First few days horrible side effects and felt way worse depressed after the 6 th day noticed a huge difference. No longer on 6 pills. Just one.

13, 4, Bipolar depressive + anxiety,Sleepiness within about an hour and a half to where I literally have to find a bed or I'll just curl up wherever I am and fall asleep_ sometimes nausea,This medication has helped me emotionally an incredible amount. The first night I took it I was very nauseous and thought I had the flu. Since then I find that as long as I eat at least 300-500 solid calories right before taking it_ I'm fine. The sleepiness is a problem in that I'm a college student and need to be able to stay up late to do homework_ so if I am forced into bed by my medication right after dinner it's quite difficult to get everything done. But the fact remains that this medication has helped me feel better than I have in years and I finally feel like a human being - reminds me of when I got my glasses and thought to myself_ is this how everyone else can see? This good feeling is what I've been missing out on! Latuda has helped me a lot and I'm okay with the side effects for that reason.,F,19,3  weeks40mg,4/1/2016,Latuda

15, 1, Bipolar II,Immediately nauseous on first taking it. Also a bit dizzy and very unsteady on feet. This eased after a few hours. However after second dose I was same all day. After third dose I had severe out of body feelings and nightmares. Still nauseous. When I woke up next morning I still did not feel well and as morning went on I got much worse. Had feeling of tongue swelling_ trouble speaking and trouble breathing. Luckily husband was with me and took me to hospital emergency ward where I had to be given adrenalin. They were not certain what happened but assumed allergic reaction to Latuda_ but thought strange as had taken it 14 hours before. Nothing else had changed in what I was taking or eating though.,Beware. I have tried just about all the available drugs to treat Bipolar II over the last 10 years and never had anything like this experience.,F,46,3  days20 mg 1X D,3/28/2016,Latuda

17, 2, Bipolar type 1,Confused_ weight gain_ sleeping_ no energy,The first two weeks on this I felt great it helped a lot with sucidal thoughts and psychosis. Then I had no energy and motivation to do anything. I was tired all the time and tried to sleep but couldn't. I was also confused a lot. Like I couldn't remember any thing. I gained a good 25 pounds while on this mainly because I craved carbs while taking it. I recently decided to quit cold turkey and while its only been a couple of days I have so much energy now and I am not craving carbs. This medicine sucks. I hope one day they will have better options for bipolar disorder.,F,28,3  months20 mg,2/14/2016,Latuda

19, 5, BiPolar Disorder,I have trouble getting going in the morning. It's almost noon before I feel awake.,It's made a huge difference in my life.

20, 1, Bipolar 1,Horrible akanesia! Tried it a year ago during a bad depression. It bumped me at the 40 mg but the akanesia was a new kind of torture so I was forced to stop. Began it again a year later for another bout of depression with psychotic features. 20 mg with 25 mg of  benydril and I did well but again when I titrated to the 40 mg I experienced extreme stomach upset and unbearable akanesia_ even accompanied by 2 doses of 50 mg benydril.,It's worth a try if you're desperate but for me_ it's one of the most hellish drugs out there.,F,40,2  weeks20-40 mg,1/12/2016,Latuda
21, 2, Mood Disorder NOS_ Depression,Nausea_ diaharrea  Increased anxiety_ manic like state_ agitation shakiness_ restlessness_ basically feeling like I had too much caffeine times 10.,This medication made me feel like I had 10 cups of coffee or something_ and I have a major caffeine sensitivity. It made me feel sick_ anxious and basically put me in an agitated and manic state. It did help with my depression a bit_ but it made my anxiety and mood problems worse. I don't remember what dosage I was on_ but it was a low one_ since my doctor always starts me on the lowest dose then usually has me cut it in half because I'm so sensitive to medication. It was also a f***ing pricey medication because I got perscribed it when it first hit the market. I was so disappointed that I paid like $70 for something that didn't even work.,F,20,1  monthsDon't Know 1X D,12/29/2015,Latuda
22, 4, Schizophrenia/Bipolar,Since my previous post I am still taking Latuda and haven't had anything to drink at all.  I have also been hospitalized twice since my last post.  I will probably be taking medication for the rest of my life.  I used to work full-time in the medical field and owned a  house before I became sick so a lot has changed.  Now I have my life centered around God_ going to church groups_ and being active in my church.  My weight is still higher than it was without taking it.

Prescribed sleeping aids don't work for me. Also couldn't deal with the nausea and stomach issues induced by this drug. Luckily_ I haven't had any of the more severe symptoms.

29, 1, Depression and mild bipolar,"I was sitting in my husbands hospital room ( he had cancer surgery) and I took morning dose with my coffee.  In about 15-20 minutes I began bobbing my head uncontrollably and my husband rang for a nurse.  I became non responsive by the time she ran in the room and she immediately called for ""rapid response team"".  I don't recall anything after my head started bobbing_ all I know is I came to about 4 hours later in the ER. I was admitted and tested for stroke.  I basically went in to a ""temporary coma"".  All test results were negative_ thus ruling out any other cause than a severe allergic reaction to the drug.  I do suffer depression but am now terrified to take anything at all.  I am trying to find a lawyer that will take my case.  The hospital filed my insurance with the diagnosis of ""severe and highly potential threat to loss of life"".",Had I been home alone or anywhere else for that matter_ I would have died.

31, 3, psychosis,I'm currently taking this medication for over 2 years for treating my psychosis episode i had two years ago. I would have to say it absolutely made me lose weight significantly (around 20 pounds) because if I didn't have a full stomach or meal properly digested_ I would vomit it all out instantly. I did have slight dizziness if I took it with my other medications and there were times I would wake up confused or a headache. Other than that_ it helped with my psychosis and enables me to fall asleep (which I so desperately need on a regular basis being a full time student and working full time).,I would suggest taking this with meals (350 calories or more) and fully digested before taking this medication to prevent nausea and vomiting,F,19,2  years20 mg,11/14/2015,Latuda

I am severely paranoid as well as annoyed with everyone I work with. Things that I would simply let go or ignore_ I'm harboring rage and paranoia about. I have tried every bi-polar med you can name and absolutely nothing worked. I was looking forward to being ""fixed"" as just another over-represented statistic of females diagnosed with depression. I'm sticking with my mood-stabilizer and getting off this crap. Expect the FDA to be shady and don't question why they allow this stuff. The FDA turns a blind eye to a lot of things including human testing in developing countries on the poor and desperate...and everyone is so concerned about the poor animals. I have a close friend that works for a pharmecutucal company. You'd be disgusted. I can't give this drug another minute of my being.

Because of my experience on it_ I have developed traumatic shock. I would never ever recommend this horrifying drug to anyone. It was a life changer for me in that I know have less trust in any medication. Everyone around me noticed the changes and I almost went to the emergency room before getting in contact with my doctor and driving in the middle of the night to a pharmacy to get benztropin and sleeping pills. I got off the drugBut the worst part was all of this happened around my 26th birthday and I was completely not myself. I can't stress enough how traumatic this was for me. My whole body was shaking_ my teeth chattering_ I could barely speak_ I couldn't stop walking around_ and that was immediately after taking the meds every night. The doctor said maybe try a lower does but I said NO I will never take this drug again.

50, 3, Bipolar depression,"I've been on latuda for 3 weeks and two days now. The first week 20 mg_ second 40 mg and now 60 mg. I have been experiencing extreme fatigue and muscle weakness an hour or so after taking the medication (around 6-7pm) which makes me want to crawl Into bed. Once I crawl Into bed I start to feel that inner restlessness feeling_ or ""akathisia"". I think its uncommon to feel it while feeling extremely fatigued at the same time but I do. I feel extremely anxious and I want to crawl out of my skin and my legs won't stop moving but I'm too tired to actually get up. I payed no mind to any of this until recently. I thought the reasons behind my symptoms were that I had been waking up at 4am or 7am for work and for school without taking naps during the day so I figured that's why I'm so tired. But I read the latuda medication guide and came across the word akathisia and saw that muscle weakness was another side effects of the drug and I began to worry. I'm still on the medication.

51, 5, Depression_  Bipolararity,Slight akathesia (feelings of inner restlessness) for an hour after taking the pill,"I'm on week two of Latuda and it has been the best med for sure so far. I have severe OCD_ anxiety disorder(s)_ ADHD_ and what the psychiatrist calls ""bipolararity"" (racing thoughts_ irritability_ moodiness) - which could just be symptoms of severe anxiety or something different on there own. After trying just about every psych med made_ Latuda has been the best. I take this in combination with 300mg Luvox and 40mg Vyvanse. Within a week the ""impending doom"" depressed feeling lifted and I felt more motivated to do things that needed to be done (versus feeling overwhelmed by the thoughts and OCD). Often times I felt so overwhelmed I would just go to bed but I now feel optimistic about things and am doing things that would normally send me to bed depressed and overwhelmed_ I find it easier to talk to people also as I feel my generalized anxiety has been significantly reduced. I use to have ""Sunday dread"" fearing the upcoming week but that has since become much more tolerable.

This is the best outcome I've ever had for any anti-depressant_ atypical_ or anti-psychotic medication.,F,49,1  months30mg 1X D,4/30/2015Email,Latuda
57, 1, Bipolar depression,From the very least dosage I was on_ I had severe nausea. Even though I would eat more than 350 calories. We added a nausea medication for me to take twice a day and I still experienced severe nausea that resulted in me throwing up every single night. I did experience some gains from the medication such as elevated mood and a more stable mood. But they were very small and barely noticeable.,Not worth the minimal gains.,F,19,1  years120 MG,4/25/2015Email,Latuda
58, 1, Bipolar 2,Horrific anxiety and dread a few hours after taking it.  Waking up in the middle of the night feeling terrified and full of doom. Extreme suicidal thoughts.  Inability to concentrate.,I was ready to kill myself on this drug.  I truly feel that I almost didn't make it.  I cannot believe this level of side effect is considered acceptable by the FDA or whoever allowed this on the market.,F,49,3  months80,4/20/2015,Latuda
59, 5, Bi polar,After taking Latuda for six months I developed uncontrollable muscle spasms in my left leg and right arm and hand_ a facial tick above my left cheek and worst of all impotency that 150 mg of Viagra couldn't help. I have since been weaned off of Latuda the spasms have stopped_ the tick disappeared_ and my erections have started to return sometimes without the aid of Viagra still waiting for that to return to normal.,,M,55,1  years40,4/17/2015,Latuda
