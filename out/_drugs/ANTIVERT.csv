4, 1, Labyrinthitis (inner ear)_ vertigo,Knocked me out flat - fell asleep on my desk. Made the vertigo way_ way worse after 2 doses. Feel like I am floating even 18 hours after last dose and am really pissed off about nothing!,I don't take any other meds and am extremely healthy other than the virus that caused this vertigo when lying down or to my left side.

12, 1, motion sickness,This medication was a total waste of my money. It simply didn't work at all for me. Plus one of it's top side effects is dizziness. And_ it did cause slight stomach upset for me. It contributed to me feeling a bit lethargic as well. This pill definitely was not the answer for helping to treat my problem with motion sickness. For me_ it was nothing but a waste of my money.,I do not recommend this pill for treating or even preventing motion sickness at all.,F,38,2  days25mg 2X D,11/7/2013,Antivert
13, 4, Vertigo,"I have a few more pills to take and won't be sure if what I'm feeling is a side effect of the pills or a symptom related to the virus (?) which  ostensibly caused my severe vertigo attack. However_ since my vertigo cleared_ my balance is precarious and I walk as though I were drunk. I see that meclizine can impair ""motor skills""_ which would presumably include walking and I'm hoping that once I stop taking it_ my balance when walking will return to normal.",My vertigo (the room spinning_ nausea_ etc.) seemed to clear up nicely within two days of my first dose of meclizine. I was told to continue with the 25 mg. dose until my symptoms cleared up completely_ and I've not be sure if the balance issue is a symptom that has not cleared up yet or a side effect of the drug. I guess I'll find out tomorrow!,F,62,6  days25 3X D,4/6/2013,Antivert
14, 1, extreme vertigo,EXTREME fatigue_ couldn't even FORCE my eyes open. Fell asleep in the tub. My eyes kepg rolling and going cross. Felt like I was in a complete fog and I couldn't even think straight.,The Dr. gave me this med in the ER. I asked if it would make me feel funny (I do not like taking meds but I was so tired of the dizziness that I was willing to try it) and he said no. I drove home 2 hours after being given the Antivert and as I was driving_ I was literally scared. I couldn't focus_ couldn't concentrate and was afraid I was going to have to pull over. I made it home safely. After a few hours of not being able to shake the feeling_ I decided to take a bath. Thankfully my cat likes to sit on the side of my tub while I bathe because I think she saved my life. I dozed off at least 4 times and every time I was awaken by my cat patting my arm. I probably would have drownd and not even cared. Dangerous drug_ if you ask me!,F,36,1  days25 mg 3X D,5/26/2012Email,Antivert
15, 3, lightheadedness_ dizziness_vertigo?,repetitive and cyclic dreams_ dizziness,Only think it helped one morning.  Otherwise_ couldn't tell the difference between the disequilibrium and the medicine.  Not sure why doctor prescribed only 3 days usage (coupled with Ciprodex),M,51,3  days25 mg 3X D,5/8/2012,Antivert
16, 4, seasickness,Drowsiness_ dry mouth and grogginess on waking.,Made me drag fairly badly for the first three days_ but after that I seemed to develop a tolerance to the side effects. Was effective at preventing motion sickness as long as I took it a while before the motion started. Being draggy is much better than feeling gaggy_ but this would not mix well with driving.,M,31,30  days25 mg 2X D,1/23/2012,Antivert
17, 5, Vertigo caused by inner ear problem,Extreme sleepiness,Good stuff!  Works extremely well.  Was prescribed 25mg - too much.  Functioned much better on 1/2 pill.  Also_ take it in the evening preferably before bed.,M,49,1  weeks12.5 1X D,8/21/2011,Antivert
18, 1, Vertigo,Extreme tiredness_ unable to think clear_ dizziness,I cannot take this drug during the day because it knocks me out so I tried taking it at night and I felt drugged the next morning and couldn't function.  Not sure why doctors prescribe this since it does not treat the Vertigo and it just make me so sleepy that it's like torture_ I'll I wanted to do while on this pill was sleep_ not good when you work full-time.,F,42,30  days 1X D,8/5/2010,Antivert

20, 2, dizziness & vertigo,made me very sleepy; seemed to wake up in a sweat at night (and during naps) on the days I was on this; it didn't really help the dizziness much--I didn't see a noticeable effect.  My vertigo/dizziness was suspected to be caused by a virus.,,F,31,3  days,1/8/2010,Antivert
21, 5, migraine and vertigo,Sleepiness,Works well to deter nausea_ I can usually get away with taking 1/4 to 1/2 of a 25mg pill to avoid the worst of the drowsiness but it'll definitely knock you out at higher doses. As an added bonus it seems to help with the confusion and anxiety that I sometimes get with migraines.,F,32,3  years,11/30/2009Email,Antivert
22, 2, Vertigo,I just took my first one while I'm at work thinking it was a non-drousy thing.

I'll just have to live with the extreme dizziness and nausea while I""m work.",F,58,1  days,10/1/2009,Antivert

25, 1, lightheadedness vertigo,extreme tiredness and more dizzy than before...seriously i have never felt this tired in my whole life_ i cant take this pill anymore_ all i seem to do is sleep,didnt help at all in the lightheadedness/dizzyness..i find it hilarious that one of the side effects for an anti-dizzy pill is dizzyness. im told if i take it longer i will eventually stop felling as tired and adjust to it. but to be honest i dont want to. its a horrible disconnected fake tired feeling that i dont like at all. its like extreme jet lag.,F,25,2  days,5/7/2009Email,Antivert

31, 1, After C-section for nausea,"The medication was administered via IV after surgery because the nurse suggested a ""new"" medication for nausea.I think she gave me too much medication. I could not keep my eyes open and several times I would wake up from sleep feeling like I would stop breathing. I could hear people talking but I could not open my eyes. I couldn't even nurse my baby because I had no use of my arms. I told my mother several times I was afraid to truly go to sleep because I felt I would never wake up! It took 12 to 15 hours to wear off and I still felt groggy for another day. I would definitely NOT recommend to take this medication! I would have much rather been vomiting than feel like I was about to die.",,F,34,1  days,8/30/2007,Antivert
