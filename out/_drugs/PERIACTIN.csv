3, 2, sleep & appetite problems,agitation_ insomnia_ dizziness,My 13yo was rx'd Periactin for possible abdominal migraine symptoms_ and to increase his appetite and help with sleep.

5, 5, Decrease appetite due to Adderal,At first some tiredness but this went away after a week,This has really helped my appetite. I am now eating normally. I would not be able to continue with the Adderall (for ADD) if not for Periactin.,M,18,3  months,9/9/2009Email,Periactin
6, 5, brachiradial prurits_ hives,None that I can tell.,I had this itching withOUT a rash for 2.5 years on my arms that suddenly developed into a rash 2 months ago_ and my allergist recommended Xyzal_ which did NOTHING.  She then prescribed cyproheptadine_ which in combination with Buspar has nearly knocked out the itch and the rash.  For anyone out there with a mysterious itching on their arms without any sign of a rash (brachiradial pruritis)_ I highly recommend this drug_ with a possible combo of it and Buspar.  My itching is 98% relieved (only slight itching when a cold front comes through or the mold and pollen count is very high).,F,41,2  months,1/10/2009,Periactin
7, 5, Increase Appetite and Weight Gain,Great Appetite_ Weight Gain,I finally eat like a normal human should! I eat three meals a day at least and snacks.

I also suffer w/migranes and it has occured to me that I don't get them anymore bc of Periactin...cool,F,19,7  days,12/9/2008Email,Periactin
8, 2, food allergies,difficulty urinating_ stomach cramps_ tremors,was a wonderful help for about 1 day. Then I reacted to it_ it stopped helping and just got me sick. Oh well_ at least I got to dream for a day of getting my life back. My immune system has become very sensitive_ so my immune reaction is kinda my problem as much as it is a problem of the drug.,M,,1  days,12/4/2008,Periactin
9, 5, ,This medicine caused a lot of fatigue in the beginning. However the fatigue subsided with time.  I also have to be sure to get a full nights sleep while on this medicine.,My doctor prescribed this medicine to help with my appetitie. I used to never eat dinner and my others meals were usually small. Within a week_ this medicine greatly increased my desire for food. I also suffer from migraines induced by stress and poor appetite and since starting this medicine_ I eat more regularly and have far less migraines. I would recommend this medicine.,F,5,2  months,10/6/2008,Periactin
10, 4, Failure to Thrive/allergies,Thirsty_ hungry_ tired & irritable,My 2 1/2 year old daughter was put on this medicine because she was very close to being a failure to thrive.  She would gag on food constantly and therefore_ not eat.  This medicine_ at least for the last 3 weeks has increased her appetite and interest in food.  It has however_ made her more iritable and cranky.  A side effect I will gladly trade to see her grow and gain some weight.,F,3,3  weeks,7/18/2008Email,Periactin
