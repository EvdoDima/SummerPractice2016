8, 2, High Blood Pressure,Headaches_ palpitations and a little shortness of breath.,My doctor gave me 4 weeks of samples for AZOR. The first 3 days I felt fine. Any swelling in my feet and hands were gone after I started the AZOR. On day 4_ I started having really bad headaches. By day 5_ palpations started. The evening of day 7 I was feeling crazy. My heart was racing and my head was pounding. I felt like I was full of anxiety.  I was clearly headed towards a panic attack.  On day 8_ I forgot to take it. Half way through the day_ I realized the headaches were completely gone and the palpations were almost non existence. I think the way to go is through weight loss. Not worth the headaches. I don't recommend AZOR!,F,45,7  days5mg/40mg,6/12/2015,Azor
9, 1, Stroke level hypertension,My BP was stroke level. We're talking 200/120.  Dr prescribed azor BP immediately went down. Few weeks later started having intimacy issues and loss of sex drive. Dr checks blood and starts me on testosterone replacement injections.  The injections worked for about a week or so after I would take them and would wear off after. Even while they were working I still had a limp noodle. I dealt with this for over 2 years and finally one day something just told me to Google reviews of the drug azor. I stumbled upon this site and started reading the numerous reviews of low T_ ED_ swollen breasts_ weight gain_ headaches. Immediately I called my doctor and asked if we could try something different for BP med and told him of my findings.  At this point I was 10 hours from home working for a month in the middle of nowhere. The nurse calls and said he won't make any changes until he sees you in the office. I was depressed that I thought I had found a solution to the problem I had battled for 2 years and my doctor whom was normally understanding of these things wouldn't do anything.  I came home from work and immediately found a new physician told him of my findings he said let's try it. He writes the script for loesartan and low and behold 3 days after I dropped azor I got my erection back. Azor gave an indication of low testosterone and the symptoms of low T. I battled this for 2 long years. It nearly ruined my marriage. My wife and I usually have an active sex life. This drug is terrib,Do NOT take this drug if you're a male. It will kill your sex life and make you feel like crap,M,32,2  years10/40,4/14/2015Email,Azor

Azor lets B.P. get no higher than 145/96 (right out of bed_ first thing in the morning). Within 2 hr. of waking B.P. usually goes to around 125/75. 12 hr.

Real muscle pain making it hard to walk. I might try benicar or natural choices_ and see what happens. Oh ya Azor has only been on the market for 3 years. Some books say you should not take a drug thats been on the market less than 7  year. Doctors just seem to throw these meds at you _ never a natural product.
