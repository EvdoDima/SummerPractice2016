I've suffered the side effects of a few drugs over the last 2 years anti depressants and others_ but these side effects are the worst by far.

Lightheadness_ nervousness.,The drug seems to be doing its thing with arrythmias_ not so sure just yet about the blood pressure. That's gone up a little after switching from 10mg Norvasc_ but it's a little early to tell yet. The lightheadedness kicks in about 50 minutes after taking it and hangs around all day.

26, 5, A-fib and high blood pressure,NO side effects,Cardizem has completely stopped my A-fib_ and taken care of my high blood pressure. But the most amazing thing that it did was stop my hives. I had hives every single day for over 6 years. I was treated with every antihistamine known to medicine_ including Doxepin. The only thing that stopped the hives before was prednisone_ which I took every day for those 6 years. Then I was given Cardizem for A-fib and within 3 days_ my hives vanished and have not come back.

I stopped dancing and socializing and had zero creativity.I was offered another calcium channel blocker but research showed the same side effects for that one. What next? This is the second BP drug to do this to me. I am normally very high energy and active and creative.
