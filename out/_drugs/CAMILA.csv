0, 1, Endometriosis,This pill is a nightmare.  I was prescribed for my endometriosis after I had laproscopy.  Day 1 I was so dizzy within 4 hrs of taking it.  I took at night.  Couldn't sleep_  nightmares_  hot flashes.  Day 2 was so fatigued I couldn't get out of bed.  I started to cramp horribly and all my endo pain was back that was alleviated by surgery.  I began to have horrible gas and diarrhea.  Day 3 I was panicked.  I was in a daze_  my legs and arms were so weak and my body could barely function.  Diarrhea.  Fatigue.  I stopped it after day 3. Today I have cramps pretty steady and diarrhea.  But I never will take any form of this again.,,F,33,3  days.35,4/22/2016Email,Camila
1, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,Depression_ Sweating_ Anger,I was prescribed this medication due to high blood pressure. After two years of experience on this medication_ I would not recommend use of this drug. My personality was altered drastically and I suffered from depression and extreme anger. After two months of stopping this medication_ I am starting to return to normal self. I wish I had not wasted 2 years of my life. Please monitor your mood closely on this medication.,F,38,2  years 1X D,2/22/2016,Camila
2, 2, To prevent pregnancy,Disturbance with sleep moodiness vivid nightmares and some anxiety and sweating really bad,I've never been on a birth control with this many side effects before and I've been taking birth control for a long time until I went off of it after I got married. My husband and I had our first baby 7 months ago. So at first my OBGYN put me on Ortho Tri Cyclen but they give me headaches. So he told me that this Camila will work good for me. Not so now I'm headed back to the doctor again. It makes me feel like a woman going through menopause not to be mean to any woman going through menopause. I don't sleep I wake up sweating really bad. I sweat all the time and I never sweat before. Not even that bad when I was pregnant. And I'm really moody I can't even stand myself snap at everybody in my family. I've been having crazy weird dreams and I have anxiety already but this pill is really making a comeback worse.,F,33,1  months,11/22/2015,Camila

4, 1, Birth control,Anxiety_ depression_ weight gain_ sore and larger breast_ heart palpitations_  loss of sex drive_ blurry vision_ extreme mood swings_ tingling in extremities.,I was prescribed Camila while breastfeeding. I waited to start it till my baby was 6 months old so my hormones had time to straighten out. The first week of taking it I started feeling down and having anxiety attacks. By the following week my sex drive was at zero_ zilch_ it no longer existed. My moods were all over the place_ angry one minute_ crying the next. I suffered for 6 months and knew things had to change when at my Dr's appointment it was pointed out I had gained 15 lbs in just that short amount of time. If you have even the smallest hormone sensitivity dont take this pill. You'll be miserable.,F,33,6  months,7/22/2015,Camila
5, 3, Pregnancy prevention,Significant hair Thining_ heart palpitations_ headaches_ dizziness_ weight gain_ extreme dry mouth_ blurry vision and MOOD SWINGS!,Camila did help prevent pregnancy I did not take it the same time everyday and it still was effective  but it's extremely difficult remembering it everyday not to mention the bad acne I had the first 2 months. Periods became very light in terms of length of time but it was always very dark in color. The symptoms were tolerable for a while but yesterday was my last day and I will be seeing my OBGYN for a different form of BC.,F,29,7  months,5/26/2015,Camila

9, 4, Contraception,Stopped period_ mood swings (at first)_ headaches (at first)_ acne,"I love Camila. I have been on this pill for a little over a year. At the beginning_ it was awful. I had mood swings that were out of control. I had constant headaches. I stuck with it because I cannot take any contraception with estrogen. After 3-4 weeks the moodiness and headaches went away! The first period I had on Camila was the heaviest and most painful of my life. After that_ I did not get my period for over a year_ which I think is AWESOME. I actually just got my first period in over a year_ and it was extremely light and only lasted 3 days. It does increase acne a little_ but providing some extra attention to your skin care regimen will keep it totally under control. I have noticed my hair is thinning a little at the top of my head_ which I never thought was related to Camila_ but now that I read someone else's comment about hair loss_ I'm definitely going to bring it up to my gyn. The hair loss is not too bad_ I've just noticed that it's a little more thin than it used to be. I am hoping that the loss isn't irreversible. Anyway_ if the hair loss is unrelated/fixable/reversible_ I would definitely reccomend this birth control to anyway who can ""tough it out"" for a couple weeks.",F,21,1  years1 pill 1X D,2/25/2013Email,Camila
10, 1, Birth Control,Acne_ hair loss_ weight gain_ two weeks straight of headaches_ increased migraines_ vivid dreams_ unable to sleep well,This is truly the worst birth control pill that I have taken.  I have been on several types over the past 20 years_ most recently Yaz and Yasmin.  My Gyn wanted me off of Yaz because they have estrogen and it apparently became a risk after I turned 40.  They worked very well for me.  This is a nightmare.,F,40,2  months 1X D,10/30/2012Email,Camila
11, 1, Birth Control,depression_ anxiety_ no AF_ acne_ mood swings_ stalled weight loss,I didn't notice it at first but_ over time this stuff made me feel as if I was losing my mind.  LITERALLY.  Unexplained crying_ bad moods_ I have never felt like this in my life. I hope others have a better experience than I did.  This was prescribed to me due to I had high BP on my last check up so I had to abandon an estrogen based pill which was not much better.,F,42,11  months 1X D,9/13/2012,Camila
