They have changed the formulary _ and now it is like poison.,F,,1  days150 mg 1X D,8/2/2016Email,Diflucan
2, 5, Systemic candida,"Most of the reviews I have read for this drug seem to be ""yeast die off"" reactions and not allergic reactions. This is speaking from experience of fighting systemic yeast for 5 years and trying 12 different anti fungal treatments. A simple google search ""herxheimer symptoms"" will explain that most of these negative diflucan reviews are from patients that have a serious underlying yeast problems_ that blame the drug for doing what it is designed to do: kill yeast in every area of your body. I am thankful for flucanazole_ no other treatment penetrates deeply into most all tissues of your body to stop the yeast. The last straw for me_ to seek RX treatment was fungal arthritis. It has worked perfectly. Sad that doctors don't know much about "" herxing."" It sounds like a lot of the patients would have benefitted from this drug if they did not run away at the first reaction. Dealing with yeast is a bit like a behavioral intervention_ things get ugly _ loud _ worse_ then they get better than ever.","One month into treatmentGood side effects:  as much energy as when I was 20 years old.  Don't need caffeine_ sleeping much less at night_ joint pain is gone_ no more carbohydrate cravings_ emotional stability that I haven't experienced in years.Negative side effects: localized and temporary itching at various infection sites (legs_ face_ eyes_ arms).  A few sharp but brief headaches ( Google ""Alzheimer's candida"").  A few sharp but brief pains internally. Side Note: also taking 600 mg daily of OTC Allicin (garlic derived)_ as studies have indicated synergism when fighting yeast.",M,33,2  months300 mg,7/22/2016,Diflucan
3, 1, Vaginal Yeast Infection,After the 4th time taking this drug with only great results I started feeling like my blood was boiling throughout my body. I would get red bumps around my lips_ nose_ ears that would itch.

My heart began to race(it was like a drum in my ear) as I dosed off to sleep_ I jumped up and felt like I was about to faint I was extremely light headed. This was a terrible_terrible experience.

I took a shower_popped a Bendedryl_  and put some cortisone cream on my stomach. Within 4 hours I had welts all over my stomach. I went back to the Dr.and he said it was an allergic reaction to the Diflucan. I had to get 2 shots in the office and now on different antibiotics.

39, 1, Fungi infection on scalp,I am having random heart palpitations that started on the third day. It is an overwhelming feeling that feels like my heart sits at my throat as if it were effecting my Thyroid. Never felt anything like this_ it's a bit scary when it doesn't seem to go away for up to hours at a time or just randomly coming and going throughout the day. It will make my heart rate randomly spike up at the smallest effort_ I run a farm and am an athlete I've never experienced such strange behavior from my heart rate. It makes me a bit panicky and certainly create a lot of worry when I get this feeling that I can't really explain other than my heart sitting in my throat. I've stopped taking the pill three days ago when I realized that what I was feeling must have been a side effect_ now from seeing others comments I am certain it is a side effect. DO NO TAKE THIS DRUG_ THERE ARE WAY BETTER WAYS TO CONTROL FUNGI STARTING WITH PROPER DIET.

46, 1, infection,My left pinky finger would begin itching at the knuckle very intensely and then the swelling would always begin a few seconds after. Only that one finger... Once a year... Could not figure out what was causing it until this time. I hasn't taken this pill in a couple years and also had not had a breakout on my finger. I took one the other day and a few hours later it began again. So this time I put two and two together and researched online. Never will I ever take it again. Every time this happens it itches so badly I want to scratch my skin off!!! My knuckle turns purple and my whole finger swells up so much it hurts. Then come the blisters... And the peeling off the skin. Two days later and it is still itching me to death!!!!!!,Avoid it..... Not worth it. Thank god I figured out what was causing this.,F,25,5  years1,5/14/2015,Diflucan

49, 1, Yeast Infection,Aside from the yeast infection_ I felt fine when I started taking the one 150mg pill of Fluconazole (the generic Diflucan)_ but later that day I started feeling as if I was coming down with the flu and developed an itchy scalp. I figured I was having an allergic reaction and took Benadryl and went to bed. The next day it had spread to my buttocks_ the nape of my neck and was even more severe on the back of my scalp now going from ear to ear. I wasn't able to see my doctor until the following week and he prescribed a prednisone pack_ which after a week of treatment finally stopped the scalp and neck itching. Now the cheeks of my buttocks are still covered in a much larger area and are still burning and super itchy and the rash is bright red and this is 4 weeks later. I have another appointment with a specialist tomorrow. I know this is from the Diflucan_ so it is my first and last time taking this medication.,,F,61,1  weeks150 mg 1X D,4/20/2015Email,Diflucan

The harsh side effects come with high doses (600-800mg per day).  Besides...the skin peeling off the soles of my feet I saw as a benefit. My feet now look as beautiful and soft as a newborn baby. This drug took away Valley Fever symptoms in just a few days.,F,45,3  years200 mg 1x,4/16/2015Email,Diflucan
52, 4, vaginal yeast infection,nausea_ stomach pain_ vaginal discharge,I had some really really mild nausea and stomach pain_ but nothing unbearable. I also had some discharge_ which I'm guessing is from the die off of the yeast when the antifungal gets to it. I took one 250 mg pill and then three days later_ one more 250 mg pill. It was effective in getting rid of my yeast infection and it has not come back so far. I'd take it again_ there were barely any side effects_ and the ones I had were very mild.,F,20, 250 mg 1X AN,4/14/2015,Diflucan
53, 3, Vaginal yeast infection,I had taken this in the past and had no problems_ it worked great for yeast infections. Took it a year ago before I left for a trip to Mexico. After being out in the sun I would feel like my skin was on fire and like I was going to faint and more but thought I had just caught a bug during the traveling. Tried it again for a pesky vaginal yeast infection. 1 200mg every 48 hours then 1 every week for 6 months. I took one M_W_ forgot Friday so I took it Saturday and then Sunday. Felt awful. Nausea like with morning sickness_ low sun/heat tolerance_ stomach pains_ very loose stools at times_ dizzy_ and rapid heart rate. Went into see my family dr. My heart rate and blood pressure was super high for me along w all the symptoms I had felt on my trip. The only similarity is that I was taking Diflucan then and I'm taking it now. Stopping it and trying Monistat 7 days. I didn't feel any of these symptoms before getting on Diflucan again. It has been so nice to find this website and know that I'm not the only one out there. My obgyn had never heard of anyone having any side effects to it. My family dr was much more reassuring in saying that it definitely could be the med. I'm a healthy female who's in great shape and works out regularly. Hope this review helps someone else!,,F,35,4  days200mg,4/2/2015,Diflucan

Within 10 minutes of taking Diflucan_ I had a panic attack_ so I took an additional .25 MG of Xanax to calm down and that made everything worse. After a long night_ I found out that there is a severe interaction between Xanax and Diflucan. Since then_ I've reduced the amount of Xanax I take_ and every time I take it_ I get delirious and dizzy. I don't know why my doctor of pharmacist would allow me to take this. It's been 48 hours since I took the Diflucan. Good news is my yeast infection has cleared up_ but I will stick with the nasty creams and suppositories for my care now.,F,25,1  days150 MG,3/12/2015Email,Diflucan
