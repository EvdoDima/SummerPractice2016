0, 4, Migraine,very sleepy and when I woke up I felt drowsy for hours. The medication did resolve migraine with nothing else would work.,I had a stadol and phenergan IM injection combined so I am pretty sure the drowsiness and sleepiness lasting so long had to do with the combination injection.,F,33,1  days2mg IM,6/18/2016,Stadol
1, 1, Migraine,Thought I was dying! Lost vision_ completely white bright lights_ hard to breath_ ear and face numb.  Had to go to ER.  BP was 61/38.  Had 2 bags of fluids and two hours later to get my BP back up to a safe range to discharge.  Will never take again.,,F,53,1  days2mg,4/20/2016Email,Stadol
2, 1, labor pain,I couldn't breathe and kept passing out. I felt disconnected and the pain was still there. I had zero energy or breath to push. I would never take this again. I was swollen in my face and would never wish my experience on any person I thought I was dying,,F,33,1  days,1/24/2016,Stadol
3, 1, Labor pain,Absolutely horrible. I guess it helped with pain but only because I was too busy feeling crazy. I was saying things that made no sense at all and struggled to breath. I felt like I was fighting with myself just to take a breath. I would much prefer the labor pain and was over the moon to finally get an epidural.,,F,35,1  days,12/27/2015,Stadol
4, 5, Migraines,Love stadol. Works super fast. Like that I don't have to shallow something when I'm nausea. I dislike that it causes my arm to go numb while trying to sleep. Feels like dead painful weight. I would stop taking it if it did this everytime.,,F,49,7  days4,11/23/2015,Stadol
5, 5, Migraine Headaches/Pain control,I have been on it for 10 years now and it still makes me sleepy if I have to take 2 doses.  During the day I am fine to take just one dose and be okay.  Yes_ it does make your nose stuffy_ therefore_ you get dry mouth: but I already have that problem,Stadol was a life-saver for me.  I tried all the migraine meds and they did not work.  The heavier drugs such as Morphine_ etc._ give me awful rebound headaches.  I have a very rare genetic degenerative disease.  I don't tolerate medicine well and I do not react in the prescribed way.  Maybe that's why Stadol works so well for me.,F,49,10  yearsNasal Dose 3X D,9/6/2015Email,Stadol
6, 4, Migraines,Nausea_ irritability_ drowsiness_ weight gain_ flu-like symptoms,"I have been taking stadol for many years for migraine headaches. I have to be very very careful not to take too much over a short period of time (consecutive days) because I become very moody and angry. I also feel lots of body soreness like I've got the flu. I'm not sure why_ and this is something no one has been able to explain. I also feel very ""swollen"" when I take it_ almost like it makes me retain water. I take this sparingly and try to only use it as my last resort. Also_ the rebound headaches are TERRIBLE",F,32,1  years1 spray,8/7/2015,Stadol
7, 2, Hospital,Used for Migraine. Felt as though I was in coma state. Very sleepy,While at hospital I was in and out of it. As the drug was wearing off I became irritable and angry out of my control. I was yelling and snapping peoples heads off. I had no control over my actions. I had never in my life ever acted in such a way. Scary in fact. I was given the drug by I.V. I was fine in the hospital while I was in and out of a coma like state. But as the drug wore off I became angry and argumentative. I made no sense because I could not think straight. Worst drug ever. My migraine did not subside and once the drug wore off I did not fall asleep. I was wide awake.,F,34,1  days 1X D,8/5/2015Email,Stadol
8, 4, Extreme migraine,Was given an injection in the glute. Within minutes I felt flushed and had a splotchy complexion. I felt very odd kind of tipsy and drowsy. Also I was very irritable. ,Overall the drug worked and helped get rid of the excruciating pain. The flush I felt was a normal response the doctor said. It went away shortly after. But the irritability lasted until I was able to go home and sleep. (1hr later),F,30,1  days2MG,6/7/2015,Stadol
9, 1, Hospital,Had just had a hysterectomy in the hospital the nurse came to administer Stadol intravenously.  As soon as she injected it_ I fel something wrong_ My eyes rolled back and I felt as If I died and came back to life. everything went dark in the room  and I came back to life my body felt flushed and as if hives were coming all over. I felt my entire blood was burning. worst experience I have ever had in my life.,The worst experience I have had in my life. Ive noticed that I don't do well with any other types of opioids either. Oxycodone gets me depressed and unable to sleep etc.,F,38,1  daysdont remem 1X D,5/15/2015Email,Stadol
10, 4, Migraine Headaches,I suffer from Migraine Headaches. It helps me. It has it's flaws but_ has been the most effective. I have tried every known med that is suppose to help. Stadol has helped me the most.,Why would an M.D want to find a different medication for my condition if it is helping me? I am told M.D's are prescribing it less. Well_ Stadol helps a lot! I don't want to try another!,F,54,7  years10 mg,3/10/2015,Stadol
11, 4, migraine,Lightheadedness or floating feeling_ constipation_ occasional stuffy nose.,If I have a migraine with nausea or vomitting_ this is the only med that seems to help.  I cant use triptans due to allergy.  Downside is that it is best suited for use at home. I would NEVER take this and try to drive. However pain relief and respite is almost immediate.   Biggest problem I have had is that doctors seem scared to prescribe it even when they know about the triptan allergy. I'm don't have history of drug abuse or addiction so I'm not sure where this iscomingfrom.,F,54,10  years2 bottles 1X M,2/22/2015Email,Stadol
12, 1, Back pain/labor,I felt like I was dying and coded in the hospital due to an allergic reaction from this drug. I have had back surgery and have had pain medication but never ever experienced this. I was gasping for air_ and only due to my husbands attentiveness of seeing I couldn't move or talk did he save my life by alerting nurses. Thankfully my daughter is ok_ but I almost died that day. It was not the nurses at CMC's fault as a matter of fact it was their quick response at bringing me back and I am thankful. Just stay AWAY from STADOL. Now_ I fear medication because I had that experience!,,F,34,1  days30,6/23/2014Email,Stadol

14, 3, Spinal Pathology,,"Using nasal formula. Second time to use in my life. First was after car accident 12 yrs ago. Now it's for spinal degeneration pain including a cyst on my cord_ multiple disc pathology_ sciatic pain_ ""significant"" stenosis_ etc_ etc_ etc. So far_ I've gotten ABSOLUTELY NOTHING from this drug. Almost zero discernable pain relief. Years ago it made me all loopy and silly and giggly_ and completely unaware of my pain. Now it's only like I've taken a unisom or benadryl from over the couter (FIVE nasal sniffs in 3.5 hours). NOTHING. Back and hip still hurting the same_ still limping_ pain still stabbing me in the groin and butt cheek. I'm just sleepy_ like it's been a long day. No euphoria or silliness or lightheadedness_ just a horrible taste in my throat that ruined my dinner_ and heavy eyelids_ and not in ""a good way"". So anyone seeking pain relief_ or especially ""drug fun_"" should look elsewhere. This drug is too tiny_ too fricken hard to come by_ and it's not worth all the bullshit you have to go through to get it for this little pain relief and only a set of heavy eyelids that a long_ hot shower could give you for a lot less money.",F,41,2  days 2X D,5/16/2013EmailHistory,Stadol
15, 3, Debilitating Migraines_,"pain relief seems to be primarily on the side I used the spray on-not sure why.Couldn't hold my eyelids open-but not asleepHave trouble falling into a deep sleep if I have taken Stadol past midday_ at bedtime it seems to put me in that sleeping but not asleep state_ so waking up not feeling refreshed. Nose bleeding_ Sinus congestion was bad after using it_ Dry mouth _ Itching all over_ but especially my noseBad taste in throat after 10 minutes or soCouldn't relax felt ""overstimulated"" by my surroundings",I've had debilitating Migraines since 2005 and none of the migraine meds work for me. Tried the Botox shots & had an allergic reaction to them-not fun at al! I am getting pain relief from the Stadol but I am not sure the side-effects are a good trade-off for me. Perhaps if they lessened over time_ as my body adjusts to it_ it would be okay. Otherwise I'm just trading one debilitation for another.,F,47,2  weeks1 spray 4X D,4/1/2013Email,Stadol
16, 1, child labor,Stadol did not relieve the pain associated with childbirth; only disabled my faculties to react to the pain. I suffered a near death experience due to hypoxia. Left my body and floated above in the hospital room. Saw the heads of my husband and student nurse below. Distinctly remember their voices below me. Death was so beautiful. No fear_ no regrets_ no reason to stay. Something brought me back. Maybe a major contraction caused me to inhale a major breath of oxygen. I felt my soul being sucked back in my body. Long term effects-I have no fear of death. It is as natural as life. We are eternal beings.,,F,26,1  daysnot sure,11/10/2012,Stadol
17, 1, Labor,This made labor worse. Instead of taking away any pain it just made me feel alternatively drowsy and crazed. It felt like I was losing my mind. Awful stuff.,,F,31,1  times,9/12/2012,Stadol
18, 2, Severe TBI_headaches for 29 years,Completely stoned_tired_forgetful_agitated.,This is some very NASTY stuff_my advise is do not take it !!

20, 1, Migraine,Extreme_ uncontrollable anger and irritation.  Itchy uncomfortable feeling in legs_,I absolutely will never take this medicine again.  I was given this medicine in the hospital for a migraine and right after receiving it was overcome with a sense of physical irritation and anger that i could not control.  I lashed out at my dad who brought me there_ and I knew what was going on but for some reason could not say anything about why i was acting that way.  ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I don't understand why they would give anyone this medicine.,F,22,1  days 1X D,1/31/2012,Stadol
21, 5, Migraine relief; pain; insomnia,Sedation (great for my insomnia too! as long as I don't use it too often); muscle aches/spasms after it wears off in 2-4 hours; reduced judgment and reduced cognitive functioning; tolerance/dependence develops quickly; zero withdrawals for me though.  Mild-moderate nasal congestion_ post nasal drip tastes gross_ and the bottles Stadol comes in are TINY_ with 10mL only.  And manufacturer claims that = 16-18 sprays?  Liars.  More like 10-12 (if lucky).,Very effective for migraines (while I wait for Frova or Relpax to kick in).  It's incredibly effective for insomnia_ only with very occasional use. I get a super rare side-effect of muscle aches/pains when the drug begins wearing off in 2-4 hours.  Not bad enough for me to discontinue.  It's a difficult drug to get a script for - most doctors haven't heard of it. Docs who have_ are reluctant to script 4 bottles/mo (my monthly rx).  I don't think 40mL of a mild partial antagonist/partial agonist opiate is that much to have at once_ 1st_ and 2d_ 10-12 sprays/wk are all I get out of those bottles (10-12 sprays/week are about what I use; I am scripted for use in both nostrils_ repeating every 4 hours (if pain doesn't go away) up to 6 times in one day (I only redose up to 4_ but still)!  Repriming is a bitch - wastes sooo much dang med.  Wish they made larger dose bottles and that docs offered this drug more as it's very safe (hard to OD on it bc ur nasal passages get saturated pretty fast_ and it's only actually 10mL(actual drug)/40mL (saline solution_ inactive ingredients).  It's a weaker form of Buprenorphine/Suboxone - why isn't this being pushed like crazy?  And it's a SCHED IV OPIATE!,F,28,1  years2 sprays 3X AN,11/15/2011Email,Stadol
22, 5, Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Initially there is a really bad metallic taste in your mouth. There is also some minor nasal congestion.,I have had chronic head pain for 43 years after a head injury_ Additionally I also have frequent migraine and infrequent cluster headaches. I have tried ALL of the Triptans and many other drugs alone and various combinations to no lasting effect. I have kept food diaries_ scent diaries_ activity diaries_ chemical exposure diaries_ and light impulse diaries without finding any correlation to my head pain. The only thing I have ever taken that is effective against my head pain is Stadol. It works for me in about 15 minutes and the only effect I get is relief. It is a real miracle drug for me.  I am a masculine man_ but the first time I took it I cried because the relief was so quick and complete. I highly recommend it.,M,49,3  years1mg 3X D,11/8/2011Email,Stadol
23, 1, labor,Difficulty breathing_ hallucinations_ impaired speech_ immobility_ paranoia_ overly-emotional_ no relief from pain_ drowsiness,This is the worst drug ever for labor. I was having excruciating painful back labor and had dilated to 7 cm. I could only endure my contractions standing up leaning into my husband while my sister rubbed my back. I didn't want an epidural so the nurse suggested stadol and said it would take the edge off. Well_ it did not. Stadol reduced me to a inarticulate crazed lunatic! Almost immediately_ my eyelids felt too heavy to keep open and I had to lay down. 2 minutes later I was hit with the most unbearable contraction. I felt like I was being pulled apart and my back breaking. Worst of all_ I couldn't sit up or form a coherent sentence to get my husband to understand that I needed help. All I could do was make these subhuman_ guttural noises that alerted him that something was wrong. After two more back-splitting contractions_ I was finally able to overcome my drug-induced paralysis. I reached out and grabbed my husband's arm and didn't let go. speaking took great effort and I didn't  sound like me at all. My speech was painfully slow and slurred. Help me! Pull me me up! I could go on_ but truly want to put the nightmare behind me. the nightmare of being trapped in my own body_ unable to communicate intelligently and forced to endure back labor laying down!,F,36,  1X D,8/29/2011,Stadol
24, 1, Labor,A few minutes after the Nurse gave me Stadol about 8 nurses rushed in my room because they had lost my baby?s heart beat on the monitor they gave me an oxygen mask and then rushed me off for an emergency c-section.,After reading others statements of the problems they had with this drug also during their labor this drug should never be used during labor.,F,29,1  days 1X D,5/20/2011Email,Stadol
25, 5, Migraines_ insomnia,Numbness/tingling in limbs_ sedation_ nasal congestion (mild)_ pain relief; waking up not feeling refreshed_ tolerance forms if used too often (more than 4-5 days per week IMO),Miracle drug for migraines! I've tried all the triptans (Imitrex_ Maxalt_ Zomig_ Relpax_ etc.) but got only bad side effects and no relief.  I'm so glad a friend recommended I ask my doctor about Stadol NS for migraine relief.  It works within 5-10 minutes_ whereas Frova takes 3-4 hours to really kick in.  Glad it's a Schedule IV - doctors seem so afraid to prescribe opiates for migraine pain.  Summary: Miracle drug for me_ I'd highly recommend it!,F,27,6  months2 sprays 1X AN,3/24/2011Email,Stadol
26, 5, migraines,Nausea sometimes_ drowsiness always,For anyone who has chronic/severe migraines_ this is the drug for you.  For all of the people that had it during labor_ probably not for you.  I have suffered from migraines for 15 years.  NO medicine targeted for migraine pain works for me_ but stadol does & it was something I could take during pregnancy.   It is a narcotic_ so it can be addicting.  Although_ I think anyone who suffers migraines doesn't look at drugs like an addict_ I think narcotics are looked at more as a life saver & a chance to catch a break from the pain....,F,28,2  years1 spray??? 1X AN,3/7/2011,Stadol

29, 1, labor,I had hallucinations_ I stopped breathing several times and  was sleeping peacefully on my own_ when this was put into my IV.  I woke up gasping for air and screaming in a panic.  My baby's heart rate dropped as well and I almost lost her.,My experience with this drug also left me completely traumatized & not able to sleep.  Since then I  wake up constantly in a panic_ as though I am suffocating.  I take meds now for panic attacks_ which I never had before.  Not to mention I am now terrified to have more children.  My experience was a nightmare & I thought I and my baby were going to die.  Just wish I would have been asked first_ so I would have had the chance to say no to the drug.  I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone having a child.  It ruined the memory of a moment that should have been so wonderful.,F,33,1  times2mg 1X AN,11/21/2010,Stadol
30, 1, Labor,Extremely tired and crazy.,"I was completely out of it the whole labor with my daughter. I don't remember anything! It was my first pregnancy and I was looking forward to the labor and delivery and to not remember anything but yelling out ""Why isn't my baby crying?"" is not how I wanted to remember it. My daughter was born DEAD because of this drug. She had no heartbeat and she wasnt breathing. She was an ashy grey color. Thankfully the nurses acted fast and were able to revive her. I don't think this drug should be administered for labor anymore. Falling asleep in between contractions is dangerous for the baby (the reason my daughter was born this way). FDA needs to re-evaluate the usage of this drug.",F,21,  2X D,6/8/2010Email,Stadol
31, 1, labor pain,A few minutes after this drug was administered. I at first felt fine_ after about 20 minutes I went crazy_ was in a living nightmare_ and stopped breathing.,When I was having my third baby I told the nurse that admitted me that I wanted to to try to have the baby with out a epidural due to the fact that I had had issues with my labor stalling out with my previous delieveries. She said no problem we can give you something to take the edge off and listed what they offered_ she suggested demerol and recommeded I did not take stadol she had seen to many problems with this drug in laboring women. All went fine until I was about 6 cen dilated and the real pain started. I told my new nurse I would like demerol_ and the new nurse ( due to shift changes) injected Stadol after I said i didnt want it_ she said it worked better than the demerol and there would be no problems. After that I spent hours with crazy hallutinations_ was trying to pull out my own hair and felt i was awake in a nightmare_ my blood pressure dropped_ I need to be reminded to breathe constantly. I thought I was going to die. After the idiot nurse left the room my husband fell asleep(way to go coach) as did I it was about 3 in morning and we had been there all day_ anyway the next thing I remember was two docters one yelling and a team of nurses. When I had fallen asleep I had stopped breathing so long it caused fetal distress which sent off some alarm_ and they had to work to get me breathing consistently . The doctor did something to reverse the effects of the drug and I reassigned a new nurse.

33, 1, Labor,Dizziness_ crazy_ out of body experience,I was given this during labor for contractions and I will NEVER take it again! It did not lighten my contraction pain at all it just made me crazy instantly.  I felt like I was having an out of body experience or something.  I couldnt control what I was doing or saying.  It was hard to move my body. Had trouble breathing like I had to concintrate on breathing in and out or I'd stop breathing.  I also had no concept of time.  When I told my nurse I DIDNT like the medicine and dont give me that again she gave me benadryl which seemed to only make me hallucinate more.  I was terrified_ even though in the hospital I felt like I was going to die and no one could help me!,F,28,1  days,12/7/2009,Stadol

I really don't get this since it is the only thing that truly helps the terrible pain.  I am NOT addicted to the stuff.  Who could be and like that feeling you get from it.

I didn't even remember when people came to visit me.  I will NEVER use this again.  Make sure your doctor puts a note in your file about it and remind the nurses because people don't always read your files.  So scary!  Doesn't do anything for pain either.,,F,32,1  times,7/8/2009,Stadol

I was so out of it after delivery I could not sit up or keep my eyes open much less hold my baby which impeded me from nursing her which is what I really desired to do-- I believe I also had this experience because the dr ordered me to have 4 cc of this medication instead of the usual 2cc--,F,36,1  times,2/3/2009,Stadol

I felt like I wasn't making any sense and told the nurse I felt like I was bouncing all over the room. Had to close my eyes or I would get dizzy.,I will never take this medication again! It was very scary and I could still feel my contractions_ only slightly less. The feeling of anxiety and panic was way worse than the contractions. I felt so out of control and like I was tripping on acid.,F,30,1  days,12/12/2008,Stadol

I was terrified!!! A nurse came in and was checking me. I was awke but couldn't talk or move. I tried so hard. Then after she left. I was finally able to scream. So I did. That same nurse came in and I told her what was happening to me and she told me to go back to sleep. The shift was about to change. A new nurse came I am unsure how long it was and I told her what I was exsperianceing and she gave me a drug to counter act the stadol. The dumb nurse before her gave me more!!!!

46, 5, Severe Migraines,Puts me in a sleep/trance state within 15 minutes (that sleeping but not asleep state); metallic taste; cotton mouth; itching when I've taken too much/too often.,I have had severe migraines for 10 years now and unfortunately I am in the small percentage of people that have an adverse reaction to triptans (Imitrex_ Zomig_ Relpax_ etc).  This is the only heavy pain medication that I can take to avoid going to the hospital.  It is NOT targeted directly for migraine pain_ so with really severe migraines it may take 2 (rarely 3) doses to get rid of the pain.  Be careful not to take multiple doses too closely together - you'll end up with a rebound headache from all of the medication.It does have the strong potential to be addictive_ but as long as you are honest with your doctor_ you shouldn't have any problems.,F,27,10  years,3/30/2007,Stadol

I slept for about 15 hours and didn't feel like myself for a couple of days. I was very itchy from the Stadol. I ended up having to take a benadryl because of it.  All in all I really feel like it helped me.  I will ask for it again.,F,29,1  days,2/8/2007,Stadol
48, 5, Migraine,About 15 min. after spraying it into my nose_ I felt the intense ice-pick like throbbing start to go away. I took a phenegren with it to help with the nausea. Much better than sitting for hours in the ER,After years of suffering with Migraines_ I at least have found something to get me through the really bad ones without going to the ER and getting a shot of some super-potent narcotic!  Stadol lasts about 5-6 hours for me.  I needed a 2nd dose_ but after that_ the pain was managable and with 24 hours_ I was back to my normal routine.  I can't tell you how wonderful it feels to NOT have to worry about getting a migraine_ and having someone take me to the ER (I think it just makes everything worse!). I honestly feel like I have my life back.  I know I'll always get migraines - (I also take topamax daily_ Frova and Maxalt) but sometimes - nothing stops the pain- and this has given me the relieve I need - without putting me 'out' for 16-20 hours!  I wish my doctor would've given this to me years ago!,F,40,1  days,1/25/2007Email,Stadol
49, 5, Migraines and stroke,At first:  extreme_ profuse vomiting; inability to walk or balance; inability to sit up after taking stadol; literally begging the floor to stop spinning.  Later on:  slurred speach_ melancoly_ very happy_ extremely relaxed.,Atenolol was eventually prescribed and the migraines_ for all intent and purposes_ diappeared over night.  Haven't had Stadol in over a year now!  Atenolol did the trick for me.  Right now_ I have a miagraine and have had for two days.  May have to have some Stadol.,M,50,1  years,9/21/2006Email,Stadol

51, 5, Debilitating Migraines,Difficulty sleeping soundly. ,"I've had severe migraines since childhood. As a young adult_ I would have a severe migraine almost every Saturday morning. I finally begged the doctor to give me something for the pain after trying ""midrin""(?) and suffering for hours after taking the Midrin. The doctor was convinced when I was taken to the ER with severe dehydration after throwing up for several hours and passing out. I was admitted to the hospital for observation_ had a CAT scan and fluids for 24 hours and was finally given something to control the pain. That together with Immitrex_ exercise_reducing stress in my life has kept my migraines to once a month for the past several years. I'm 6'0 193 lbs and one spray of Stadol takes about 15 minutes to completely abort the Migraine. This would have saved me countless hours of missing work had my doctor taken me seriously when I went to him originally.",M,34,5  years,7/6/2006Email,Stadol

56, 4, Migraines,Nausea and vomiting_ flu-like symptoms_ depression_ and confusion,I'm a dentist myself and have suffered from migraines since age 12. I have been taking Depakote_ Neurontin_ and Elavil for migraine prevention for around 7 years. They greatly reduce the frequency of attacks. I use Imitrex injectable when I have my aura (a true lifesaver that has very few side effects). I have used the other triptans (Relpax_ Maxalt_ Frova_ Zomig etc.) and nothing works as good as Imitrex. My doctor believes it is important to have a rescue opiod_ he has tried Lortab_ Levo-Dromoran_ and Percocet but I cannot keep them down so they are useless. He then tried Stadol NS (which I myself prescribe occasionally for post-oral surgery pain)_ which dulls the pain quickly usually within 30 minutes but I don't recommend it to just anyone as the side effects can be terrible (just makes you feel plain yucky!) It is important to note that unlike Imitrex_ Stadol will not relieve your nausea_ it will make it worse. This medication however can be a lifesaver when you don't feel like making a trip to the ER. Just a side thought about opiods_ as a dentist I prescribe opiods (usually Talwin_ Vicodin_ or Tylenol#3) to my patients who are expieriencing nerve pain_ or need a stronger med after oral surgery_ and never have I had a patient manipulate me for drugs. If the treating doctor monitors the patient the risk of addiction is so small. Pain in the US is far undertreated and doctors must realize that opiods have their place and can make a patient more comfortable. In my opinion doctors who don't treat pain properly are just as much at fault as a doctor who makes a surgical error. Both are malpractice. L. Sanderson_ DDS,M,30,2  years,2/22/2005,Stadol
