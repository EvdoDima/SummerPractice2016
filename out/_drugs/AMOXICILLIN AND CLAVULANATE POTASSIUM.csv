0, 1, Viral infection,This is poison. Took only 1/2 of this horse pill and woke up soaked in sweat_ sluring speech and  fading in and out according to husband. Rushed to ER. Horrible stuff. FDA should ban this!,Never had any issues with Amox until this. Something has changed. I would steer clear of this stuff. Imagine if I had taken the whole pill. Stopped use after 1/2 dose,F,40,10  days875,5/13/2016,Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium
1, 2, Cat bite,Took a total of 5 days..day 5 was awful! Every joint on my body ached_my back made it impossible to sit ..plus legs hurt so bad I couldn't walk. Also started getting very lightheaded and yes..it made me constipated .I i felt as though I had the flu _but this would come over me 3-4 hours after taking recommended dosage. Cat bite healed and Dr not in on weekend..short of the E.R. I took it upon myself to discontinue med's.,Miserable medicine!! I have taken Amoxicillin before  with no problems but this one threw me for a loop...never again ..I've been off 1 day and still waiting for lightheaded feeling to subside .,F,64,10  days875 2X D,4/9/2016,Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium

3, 3, dog bite on hand,Extremely loose stool,By the morning after the fourth dose_ stools are so loose that I am afraid to leave the house - these side-effects are far in excess of those I've experienced on other antibiotics - however_ the nurse said Augmentin is the best antibiotic to use for dog bites so I need to get through the next five days the best I can - I should have taken the probiotic pills from the first day - started on them yesterday and they help!,F,63,7  days125 mg. 2X D,4/18/2012,Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium

TOO Normal_ will call it Mild Diarrhea but gone twice a day_ cramps are continuous_ also unusual bleeding from vagina...(Not Period_ as Tamoxifen has stopped them since June of last year. Only lasted 2 days...Can't get rid of the cramps_ feels like a ""Muscle Tightness"" of my lower abdomen. Don't know what to make of it.. Stopped taking them_ the heck with it.",,F,44,4  days400mg 2X D,4/26/2011Email,Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium
5, 3, double ear infection,tooth staining_ loose stools,my son_ age 3.5_ had stained teeth by the 6th day of taking this.  We brush his teeth 2x a day and had just been to the dentist 2 weeks ago for a cleaning.  I know the meds caused this staining.  It says on the paper from the pharmacy that it may cause staining of teeth in children and to tell the doctor if it occurs.  The doctor stated that this does not usually happen from amoxicillin but to brush his teeth with baking soda and water. I don't know how that will go over with a 3 year old who doesn't know how to spit very well yet.,M,3,10  days5.1 ml 2X D,2/8/2011,Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium
6, 4, sinus infection,Diarrhea,"After 3 pills I got pretty bad diarrhea.  I couldn't cough_ sneeze_ or blow my nose without going a little.  Before taking the pills_ I was not eating right for a few days because I had a really bad sore throat and I hadn't gone #2 in three days. I did try to eat before I took the pills.  A friend told me to eat yogurt like Activia. I'm on day 4 of a 10 day prescription and the diarrhea is better_ but I still have ""bubble guts"". I might go get some yogurt tomorrow!",F,32,10  days875/125 2X D,12/10/2010,Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium
7, 3, Sinus Infection,Nausea_ bloating_ diarrhea_ yeast infection_ general itching,I learned the hard way that you must take this right before_ during_ or right after a meal.  The bigger the meal the better.  I got a bad yeast infection after being on it for only 3 or 4 days.  I didn't think to take probiotics with this medication until after the yeast infection showed up.  I have also noticed general itchiness over my whole body_ especially at night.  I am now on probiotics and only have a day and a half left of this medication.  If I ever need to take this stuff again I will be sure to load up on probiotics!!,F,28,10  days874-125 2X D,6/30/2010,Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium
