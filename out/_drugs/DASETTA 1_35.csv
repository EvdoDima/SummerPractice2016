0, 1, Endometriosis suppression,Migraines,I was put on this after my surgery for endometriosis to help suppress is and prevent recurrence. I had no issues other than unexplained migraines that started shortly after I started this pill. They're ruining my life and becoming more and more frequent and the only explanation is this pill. Other than that_ it has worked well for me_ but the migraines were enough for me to throw the rest of them in the trash and try something new.,F,27,1  years35,5/31/2016,Dasetta 1/35
