5, 4, to stop smoking,About the time I stopped smoking_ a year ago_ now_ I started chewing the gum. I developed a swelling and mild discomfort in my stomach. Gastritis_ based on internal examination recently_ seems to be the problem. I see some comments here that link the gum's use to gastritis. The gum seems to induce me to drink more_ and excess drinking also seems to be a cause of gastritis. Curiously_ I mentioned to both my doctors who are in one way or another treating me for the stomach swelling and pain issues that I was chewing the gum. Neither said it would present a problem.Well_ I am so tired of the stomach problems_ enlarged abdomen etc.. that I'm going to make a sincere effort to cut out the gum and cut down on the alcohol. I have become addicted to that combination and its hurting my health. Gotta quit.,,M,68,1  years2 mg 10X D,6/9/2016Email,Nicorette
6, 1, To stop smoking,I never smoked till I was sick at 43 I smoked for six months and then started nicorette after three years I basically turned into a vegetable of doom and gloom I could not drive I thought I was at burnout within myself I was depressed and anxious and felt like I could not go on I stopped doing the basic things human beings enjoy in life I ignored the rashes the panic attacks and would not listen to my friends and family who were trying to tell me I had every listed side effect I had to have a gum 24/7 in my mouth while I slept,After three years I came off nicorette within five days I felt happy within seven days I could drive the car again at ten days I was listening to music.  But at 15 days the screaming addiction in my head and mouth was horrendous I had to get the doctor to prescribe a calmatives to knock me out I am not through the woods yet and this stuff is the devils own if I had not seen the difference the last month in myself I would not have believed it.

Previously addicted for 5 years_ went to addiction clinic for help_ got off the Nicorette but started smoking again. Not sure if any or all of my symptoms are a result of using Nicorette.  However I have undergone all sorts of tests and camera investigations and no obvious cause can be found for any of these problems.  Having now read other people's symptoms there is too much similarity for me to ignore the fact that Nicorette might be causing mine. I am going to do my very best to give up_ it's not going to be easy as I am totally addicted.,F,71,7  years30+ Mg 1X D,6/3/2016,Nicorette

11, 5, To quit smoking,Years ago_ I used the gum- that had adverse effects on my teeth. Quitting gum sent me back to smoking. Til I found the lozenges... Been using lozenges happily with no side effects. (They are just a bit expensive). I only use niccorete brand 4 mg MINI lozenges. The regular size lozenge would leave white marks around my lips. I am thrilled to have this product and be smoke free!,Highly recommend the mini lozenges to QUIT SMOKING!! If you're still smoking_ stop! That's a proven killer. It's a shame the government doesn't promote smokers to quit. It should be a top priority_ with more commercials and information about the hazards of smoking. Shameful to see how poor people spend their last dollars on cigarettes.,M,44,1  years4 mg,3/25/2016,Nicorette

13, 4, To stop smoking,For the past few years my dentist has been telling me i grind my teeth - which didn't sit right with me - and now i realise the damage is caused by chewing on this gum which has been eating away at the teeth and causing substanial damage on the side where I chew.,While brilliant at stopping me smoking I am addicted to it_ and had no idea that I was ruining my teeth - you need to be extremely careful with this gum. My dentist (UK) has no idea about the effects of Nicorette and dentists should be better informed.,F,59,15  years2mg 10X D,3/2/2016,Nicorette

I have previously tried chewing the gum for an hour and then adding a half piece of Trident for the following hour.  It helped tremendously with the anxiety and sleep problems.  I also found that I would go for longer periods of time without remembering to have another piece of Nicorette.  I am going to start doing this again and take it a step at a time as I gradually stop using altogether.,F,66,6  years2mg,2/4/2016,Nicorette

Extremely addictive,I have been taking the 2mg and or 4 mg mint lozenges since 2008_ and I had to have one in my mouth constantly_ it would come out right before I ate_ and go right back in after. Most of the time I had 2 lozenges in my mouth at all times_ upon waking until I was going to bed. I used zero discretion with these because it was better than smoking. I just have a sinking feeling that it must be corroding my stomach the way it is doing so with my teeth_ call it a gut feeling. I am on day 7 of quitting and I have been so moody and depressed and lethargic. I feel like a giant exposed raw nerve_ and I am extremely touchy and sensitive.

20, 2, To stop smoking,Hair loss_ bloating_ upset stomach_ mouth ulcers_ weight gain and inability to lose weight. Teeth coroded. Terrible wind! Feeling tired and generally unwell.,I've been on the 2mg lozenges for the last couple of years before that it was the 2mg fruit gum. It is highly addictive and I started to panic if I was going to run out.  I've been to the doctors for blood tests as I was feeling completely exhausted everything came back fine. I have been worried about the long term effects this stuff has on your health so did a Google search and came across this site. I had gone 24 hours without a lozenge and it spurned me on to kick this terrible addiction.  It's now been 11 days Nicorette free and although I found the first few days not to bad I feel quite depressed now. I'm gonna stick with it and hopefully won't feel so crappie as time goes by.,F,49,8  years2mg,12/17/2015,Nicorette

But then I got into the habit of constant use every day. After about a year I noticed my hair went very limp and ' dead ' looking and over the past month or so has thinned by about fifty percent. I've stopped taking nicotine for three days now and the falling seemed to have practically stopped. Phew. The best way to get me off it. Make my hair fall out !!  I wish I'd known this before.

If you are reading all these comments_ believe them there are too many comments for us all to be wrong. I noticed my hair falling out at and alarming rate and thought this was just part of the normal cycle. Trust me_ it's not and its just on for way too long. I am now on medication for severe acid reflux attacks and this was the final straw that made me stop taking this stuff.

26, 1, Stop Smoking,Hair loss - chest pains - teeth loss - torn bicep tendons - anxiety - mental confusion -small cuts never healing.,A regular pack of cigarettes contains around 15 mg of nicotine and when you inhale your lungs can only absorb around 10 to 15 percent of the nicotine. So when you smoke one pack cigarettes you are only absorbing around 2 mg of nicotine for the whole day.Now the problem with the gum and lozenges is that you are being told it is alright to overdose on nicotine for 12 weeks. For example_ one piece of gum contains 2 mg. of nicotine which is equal to a whole pack of cigarettes. So what happens when you eat the maximum recommended dosage of 20 ? 2 mg lozenges or pieces of gum a day? What happens is that you are now absorbing a total 40 mg of nicotine a day. That is equal to 20 packs of cigarettes a day!  Then if you eat the 4 mg gum that is equal to 40 packs of cigarettes a day! 40 packs of cigarettes a day!  You are also instantly addicted the very first week you use it. That is if you don?t to start hick up and then throw up your lunch all of the time. Also I wish you some good luck when you try to go back to smoking cigarettes. I guarantee that you will be smoking at least 2 packs of cigarettes a day. In a way it would be cheaper to just pay the $70 a week for the gum. Then after all of your hair and teeth fall out your heart will stop. I am not kidding! But at least you will have stopped smoking.  Go into any Walgreens or CVS and look at what is right behind the cashier in every store across the country and what do you see?  You will see their most profitable sel,M,,1  years0 1X D,11/12/2015,Nicorette

42, 1, To quit smoking,I dont know where to begin with this stuff. I have been quit smoking for about a yr although i do sneak around from time to time and smoke a cigar. I hide the nicorette gum use. Im with someone who doesnt know i have any more habits. Thats a whole other ballgame in itself_ but I did try to quit the gum a few months ago. Oh_ a few days went by and I was back chewing. Im hooked on the fruit chill 4mg. I can finally say I am ready to kick this habit for good. I dont know if this is linked to the gum or not but I have gained a lot of weight and I just have this general feeling of being unwell. My jaws hurt. Might i add_ i chew one after the other all day and i buy the little 20 count boxes. This is the most horrible addiction. I have been 10 years clean off meth and 16 yrs off cocaine and coming off all that was easier than this it seems. Now if I can just kick this habit and STAY quit and stop taking over the counter energy supplements_ Ill be very thankful. I guess im just scared of the withdrawals from it. Hats off to the ones who have already successfully kicked it to the curb.,DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE NICORETTE.

I knew a lot_ but it was averaging over $500.00 a month! So stupid!!!! I quit chewing the gum now over 2 weeks. What I did was: I bought the patch 21 mg for 1 week_ then the 14 mg for one week and now I'm on 7 mg for the last week. I also chew extra gum to help. So far so good.

Its only been a week since I have stopped the chewy_ but already I have noticed a massive difference in my hair_ nails and attitude.  I feel like my usual happy bubbly self and can't believe the difference in 1 week. Yippeee!  I am so happy!!!  I am going to see my doctor and also tricologist next week to let them know what has been going on_ they may have other patients with the same symptoms that they can't diagnoise.,F,57,4  years2mg 10X D,8/13/2015,Nicorette
49, 1, To stop smoking,Sharp chest pain_ feeling sick with no energy constantly_ weight gain_ lack of sex drive_ teeth decay and a general feeling of anxiety,I have done so much research on this and everything says it is safe! I think deep down I knew it wasn't. Am trying to quit after reading all this posts. I don't need strange cancers_ heart disease_ loss of teeth and everything else people are talking about here...,F,35,10  years2mg,8/10/2015,Nicorette
50, 3, To stay off cigarettes,Gums have receded over half a centimetre in the side where I chew,A lot of the comments here are unfair. Nicotine is fiercely addictive. That's why substitutes like Nicorette exist to put nicotine into your system without all the other harmful stuff you get from smoking. Of COURSE they are addictive. It's our responsibility as a user to manage that. I failed to and I am currently addicted but I don't blame the manufacturers_ I blame me! Due to the damage to my gums from years of Nicorette abuse I am now going to try to quit Nicorette. Pity because I love chewing it.,M,44,10  years40 MG 3X H,7/3/2015Email,Nicorette
51, 3, substitute cigarettes,Hair thinning hiccups ear popping and air noises this went when my jaw muscles got used to chewing. Odd salty taste with original flavor as they contain sodium in 4mg,Hello to you all_ I am a 48 year old smoker_ around six years ago I gave up with no aid at all cold turkey_ around three months later I discovered blood in my stools and to cut a long story short was diagnosed with Ulcerative-Colitis. The symptons got worse as time went on_ these included a rash on my forehead with pimples_ Ulcers in my my mouth as well as other parts of my body_ poor eye sight and blurred vision_ painful joints. What surprises me is that 85% of sufferer?s of UC are ex smokers or smokers and affects 1 in 400 people in the Uk_ so it stands to reason that most of these symptoms would be attributed to any stop smoking aids. My new doctor had no knowledge of the link between smoking and bowel disease so therefore would have not have diagnosed my UC and himself blamed any alternative stop smoking aids. After 18 months of not smoking and I was nearly house bound with symptons so I started smoking again within 2 months was symptom free. I have tried all nicotine products and within 3 months my symptoms return. I know smoke 10 cigs a day low tar and consume around 10 4mg plain gum pieces and this is possibly the best combination for me. My gum symptons seem to be_ hair loss at fist popping ears wich seem to be my jaw muscles getting used to constant chewing and hiccups.What I am summerising is that some of these symptoms metioned in this and other sites could be caused by bowel problems that smoking has masked_ and should be explored as to get the best diagnosis.,M,48,6  months4mg 10X D,6/26/2015Email,Nicorette

53, 3, quit smoking,2.5 years of chewing Nicorette gum with no problems_ the occasional headace or sore jaw_ but that is expected when chewing so much gum. Have become addicted to it and the last half a year have been experiencing confronting heart palpitations and chest pain. Cannot be sure it is accociated to the gum but I have a feeling that it is. Naturally worried when experiencing chest pain_ and now needing to quit the gum.,They need a quit line for Nicorette products,F,25,3  years2mg 10X D,6/17/2015Email,Nicorette

56, 1, To stop smoking,STAY OFF THIS  GUM!  I do not care what the flavor is stay off...I have developed hair loss of 50 %.  Pain in both arms_ and legs_ It became so bad I was convinced I had developed bone cancer.  When I tapered off this gum and consequently stopped_ the pain all over my body did as well.  It made me hyper_ erratic_ moody_ argumentative_ almost manic in state.  I would rather smoke.  The wonderful thing about all this is since I have stopped using Nicorette_ my cigarette cravings are less than when I was chewing that gum.  It is a totally self defeating way to overcome the habit of cigarettes. Read Alan Carr_ anything if u must to change the BEHAVIOR of your habit. You could not pay me to put a piece of that gum in my mouth again_ and trust me.  I loved it big time.  Never again.,DO NOT USE.  PERIOD.,F,53,10  years2mg 10X D,5/9/2015Email,Nicorette
57, 1, To replace smoking,Took lozenges and gum on and off for three years. I thought this was a foolproof. risk free way to feed my nicotine addiction_ and to mitigate the weight gain associated with quitting smoking cold-turkey (nicotine is an appetite suppressant_ and it boosts the metabolism). Side effects with gum and lozenges were actually different. Witht he gum_ my teeth and gums became sensitive_ and my gums bled more easily. I began to fear losing my teeth. The gum also made me more antsy and 'wired'. The lozenges had a more relaxing effect (I think because the nicotine in the lozenges is released at a slower pace). I did not have oral symptoms for using lozenges_ but I had digestive issues_ trapped wind_ painful digestion_ irritable bowels. Overall intake of nicotine temporarily and noticeably increased blood pressure. I would go from 70 BPM to around 85 BPM in a short time. I also tried electronic cigarettes. I found no noticeable difference between each delivery method (I was in it,Nicorette and other nicotine delivery methods will help you quit smoking (at least temporarily) but will keep you nicotine dependent. In this sense they are exactly like cigarettes_ but without the chemicals - the nicotine is the reason you are drug dependent_ the cigarette (like the lozenge_ or gum) is just the method of delivery.The use of NRT also brings with it health problems with long term use. According to anecdotal evidence from a large number of smokers_ prolonged use results in tooth decay_ hair loss_ tooth loss and digestive discomfort. I am now quitting with Allen Carr's EASYWAY. As cheesy as it is_ it works far better than NRT.,F,27,3  years4 8X D,4/8/2015Email,Nicorette
58, 1, To quit smoking,Seriously_ they should tell people that the gum is more addictive than smoking. I have ruined my teeth and gums and am not grinding my teeth_ probably because I don't chew at night... The cost is unbearable_ about ?200 a month in the UK. I consume three boxes a week so 315 pieces of gum. This is madness. I tried to quit but I go crazy - the gum hits faster than the cigarette. Plus cigarettes are meant to relax you_ whereas the gum makes you very edgy. Pharmacists say 'you quit' - how can you quit when you are hooked on nicotine worst than before? One person at boots said I should speak to the pharmacist - how can I? These people never smoked! I wish I never started_ but this Easter_ I am locking myself in the house and will quit and I am sure I can find a better use for over ?1_000 a year! Don't do it if you are thinking about it. It costs more than smoking!,,F,44,3  years40 1X H,4/2/2015,Nicorette
59, 1, Quit smoking,About 4 or 5 hours after my last dose I started to feel antsy.  I don't know how else to describe it. I started to bounce my legs up and down on my toes while sitting there. I couldn't focus my attention on anything_ except the fact that I had no more NICORETTE. My arm muscles felt as if they fly out of my skin_ and my skin was crawling. About 8 to 10 hours after my last dose I started to feel nauseated_ and started to sweat heavily. These feelings would persist for the next week or so.,Felt great during my usage days_ no lie.,M,20,7  years4 MG,3/16/2015,Nicorette
