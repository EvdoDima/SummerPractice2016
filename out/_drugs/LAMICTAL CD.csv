0, 5, bipolar_ mood stability,"At first I was slightly drowsy in the morning. I am having trouble with my knees ""falling out"" which started around the same time I started my lamictal.  .",Has anyone encountered a similar situation? Beside my knees_ which could be due to anything (don't want to blame the drug) BUT lamictal absolutely saved my life and the ones around me. I was a mess_ post partum_ bipolar_ anxiety_ depression_ manic. It has literally saved me! I am SO HAPPY my doctor prescribed this medication for me.,F,27,4  years200 mg,6/9/2015,Lamictal cd

2, 5, depression with severe mood swings,I have a slight case of lamictal brain-fuzz. My memory is a little worse and I have trouble spelling when I didn't before_ but it is mild.,I've been cycling through depression meds for 7 years. I used to have extremely bad mood swings that were uncontrollable...I could go from happy to extremely depressed or irritated in a matter of minutes. I felt horrible because the slightest thing could set a mood swing off_ like a ripped pair of jeans. Lamictal has been a godsend and has helped in a way no other medication has. I hope I never have to stop taking it; I am still depressed at times but it is milder and now my moods are mostly stable and my life isn't being taken over by my mental illness.,F,26,6  months100mg,2/20/2015,Lamictal cd
3, 1, Mood Swings,This drug has made my asthma horrible. My rescue inhaler barely helps. This made my mood swings worse and my anxiety 10 times worse. I've also had a few panic attacks.

4, 5, Bipolar,This medication has saved my marriage. I was a mess before I started taking it. I picked fights with my husband constantly. Finally_ he told me he couldn't take it anymore and was considering leaving. I knew at that point that if I wanted our marriage to work_ I was going to have to get help. My doctor put me on Lamictal and within days I noticed an improvement in my mood. I'm not 100%_ but I am much better off than I was before I started taking it. I have a lot going on in my life_ including the loss of loved ones and dealing with several medical issues with myself as well as my children...some of these issues are progressive and incurable. Lamictal has helped me deal with everything head on_ instead of curling up in a ball crying and being unable to face life. I can finally be strong for my family. Things could not be better between my husband and I. We get along great and we're finally able to give our children the loving_ stable environment they deserve. I will never stop taking this medication. As far as side effects_ if I have any_ they have been so mild that I haven't even noticed them. Yes_ some people do have unpleasant side effects_ but that's a possibility with every medication out there...even Tylenol. What works for some_ clearly does not work for others. You'll never know if this will be a right fit for you unless you give it a chance. It's worth a try_ in my opinion. ,,F,35,1  years100 MG,5/18/2014Email,Lamictal cd

7, 1, BIPOLAR AND ADHD,This drug made me stare out of the window_ non social_ people kept telling me I was not myself  and asking me what was wrong and I did not feel like myself. I was not thinking at all. There are alot of people who do not know I am adhd or bipolar_ they just think I am a get her done type of person and am very social. Limictal with paxil made me a zombie_ did not feel comfortable_ my stomache always hurt- would try to make it feel better by eating_but that did not help. I forget all of my symptoms but I felt as if I were dying. I also have never had gory and mutilation dreams_ being scared and trying to run away. I started having horrible seeming so real nightmares. I am thinking that I was misdiagnosed as bipolar and I am only adhd. Both run in my family and I did tell the dr. I went to that I don't believe I have strong bipolar symptoms. I know what a person acts like and the symptoms from speaking with 2 of my sisters that have bipolar.

9, 5, bi polar II,I have had no side effects what so ever. This medication is like the missing link in my brain.,"I got a diagnosis of bi polar II disorder in 2005. I have been treated for depression only in the past...unaware that the ssri's would make me hypomanic. Lamictal has helped me so much. It evens out my moods_ which for the most part is good. I also take celexa. They even out my moods and dull them a bit_ but it is better then crying all the time_ insomnia_ paranoia_ and rage. It sucks having to be on medication. I wish I could go off them and be a normal person_ because I have had periods in my life when I was ""normal"" but if I miss even a single dose I am struggling to function and if I miss a few days my world literally falls apart_ can't work or function around people. Anyway_ it has helped me a lot and it has helped me stay sober. Haven't had a drink in almost 6 years. ",F,48,5  years200mg 1X D,4/27/2012Email,Lamictal cd
10, 2, Bipolar II with mixed states,Inability to orgasm_ problems with talking_ eyesight changes_ confusion_ short term memory loss_ trouble sleeping,"All in all_ this drug has been a godsend for me and my relationships.  While I'm still struggling to become a better person_ this drug has removed quite a few roadblocks.  I have side effects and they definitely bother me after having been on the drug for a few years_ so I'm considering weening off after speaking to my doctor.  Two years ago you might have found me either exercising or crying uncontrollably any giving time of the day_ even at work on breaks_ but now I'm a pretty well adjusted person who's finally calmed down enough to pursue some interests other than drinking and laying around watching tv.  From what I've read about lamictal_ it's nothing you want to stay on long term_ especially if you having side effects.  As far as side effects go_ (and pardon_ i'm in a hypomanic state atm) I tend towards mixing up my words_ forgetting what i'm saying midsentence (which makes me look like a total DA at work)_ I have swirly and sometimes static like vision_ especially when I'm looking at bright objects like the sky and the computer.  I have residual images constantly_ I have a hard time getting my brain to ""work"" sometimes_ like during math_ and some trouble sleeping.  I also have stiff muscles and find myself clenching my entire body during the day and at night.  So basically_ it's worsened the normal effects of hypomanic states in bipolar disorder_ in many ways_ while keeping me completely level headed about it_ if that makes sense.",F,24,2  years50 1X D,2/21/2012Email,Lamictal cd
11, 1, Bi-Polar,"Feelings of indifference_ increased disasociation with reality_ irrational thoughts sometimes stemming from ""lucid dreams"" that he is certain mean something. Sporatic and unpredictable aggresion accompanied by severe shaking. Disreguard for responsibilities. Warped sence of invincibility. Increased confusion and inability to cope with distractions.","I am writting this on behalf of my husband as a warning to other concerned spouses/children/partners/parents out there that are experiencing_ second hand_ the negative side effects that this drug may be having on their loved one. After my husband began taking Lamictal he started feeling ""better"" quickly. This led to sudden thoughts that he is in his right mind and should be focusing on him and his needs while his children and wife sit on the sidelines. He has now lost his wife and children and beleives that it is a good thing. He has left the house and is only paying for his room and board where he is staying and refuses to pay the bills he left with his wife and children. This is all very recent and who is to know if he will remain happy with these changes but he has very limited interaction with his children at this point and the effects on them have been huge. It does appear that he feels better but from what I see it is only better because he isn't reguarding any of the responsibilities that he has. Only time will tell how he responds when reality hits him but from what I have seen so far he will continue to withdrawl. He refuses to listen to my feedback about his treatment and has concocted a grand story in his mind that I am the root of his anger issues and with out me he will now be better. He has taken this to the extreme of simplifying our seperation saying that I just didn't want him to go hiking so I ended our seven year relationship and tore our children",F,32,3  months100 MG 1X D,7/11/2011Email,Lamictal cd

14, 4, Bipolar I_ Hypomania & Depression,None at first_ spontaneous and rapidly worsening symptons after 8 months.,"After months of severe insomnia_ suicidal thoughts_ etc. lamictal was a godsend. Within a couple weeks my entire life turned around. No significant side effects_ but I generally don't get side effects. It continued to work through the summer_ wasn't affected by any pain killers from a few surgeries. What really made me realize it's full effect was how well it worked during a really disastrous breakup. Never been so sad in my life_ but I was able to function_ go to school_ etc. I didn't have any suicidal thoughts like I would have had in the past. Mid-October_ it suddenly stopped. It started with insomnia_ restlessness_ crying all the time_ inability to finish work_ lack of motivation_ couldn't get out of bed_ extreme hunger_ etc. I was put on 300 mg... no change. I started getting weird anxious energy_ like... when I was upset or stressed I started acting ""scary."" Spontaneous_ very neurotic reactions to little things. Inability to connect to emotions_ connect to physical actions. I'm so glad someone else reported this: weird_ compulsive head-scratching. And my shoulders and collar bones. I picked at my skin until I had little scabs like bugbites_ but I never realized it. I displayed all the symptoms of public anxiety but never ever felt paranoid or anxious. This December it's continued to get worse_ severe depression and listlessness_ crazy insomnia_ apathy... I started Seroquell XR which was miserable.

He had me taking alprazolam_ ambien_ xanax and adderall all at the same time.( WTF? )Before that I had tried lorazepam_ Lexapro and Cymbalta. Nothing worked.  The thought was that my anxiety was triggering depression and I couldn't focus so I took something for that_ and then I needed something to make me sleep. Didn't work. I was total zombie for months and I was suicidal. Up and down.. I was scared and paranoid all the time. I felt so terrible I wanted to die. I found a new doctor who put me on Lamictal. It completely evened me out and I felt like a human again. The anxiety I had was gone and I was so happy to have my life back. It really seemed like a miracle drug. HOWEVER... a few months ago I started experiencing joint pain and swelling. My knees give out. I sometimes have to walk backwards up the stairs and I am not over weight. I can hardly get out of bed in the morning. My feet turn inward - cant put them flat on the floor. I feel like someone threw me down the stairs when I wake up and I have a hard time gripping things. An example: I was carrying a gallon of water into the house and when I sat it down sharp pains started shooting up my arm. After just a short bike ride my knees give out and my wrists hurt.

32, 3, Depressive Bipolar II,Inability to focus vision on fine details_ some discoordination with fine motor tasks_ abnormal liver functions_ high triglycerides and cholesterol_ and CRIPPLING BACK PAIN.,I was excited to try this med as_ like many people with BPD_ I have a hard time taking SSRIs. It's claimed to be more effective against depressive episodes than more regularly prescribed BPD meds like Lithium_ and it was. However_ I gradually developed back pain during the slow dose increase used to start this medication. It started as a slight stiffness in my back_ and I assumed I was just out of shape. Then it became painful_ and I assumed I had hurt my back somehow_ but didn't think the Lamictal had anything to do with it. By the time I got to 200mg_ I was basically crippled and wondered each time I bent over whether that would be the time I wouldn't be able to stand back up- at 37 and fairly healthy_ I knew something was wrong. In spite of pointing this out to various doctors and nurses_ none of them seemed to make the connection_ and it wasn't until I did my own research that I found that a VERY HIGH NUMBER of people have similar complaints_ something like 1 in 12. At 200mg I had my blood checked_ which revealed abnormal liver functioning_ and high triglycerides and cholesterol. The doctors (all psych trained) didn't find that odd either. I have stopped taking the med and hope that sometime in the next month or so my back will recover and that the damage isn't permanent. So PLEASE recognize that your doctors are not all-knowing gods_ and that the side effects of this med can creep up on you VERY slowly.,M,37,3  months,8/23/2009,Lamictal cd

Quick mood swings on the first day which I found interesting. I was laughing and crying at the same time. My moods started to calm down. Instead of quick mood swings....I would have a bad mood one day and good mood the next day. Always felt aggitated and irritable at night. I had to take 2mg of Clonzepam to get me to sleep. Felt my skin itching but no visible rash. That sensation disappeared after I got into my new dose level and it started again when the pdoc increased my dose. I felt he moved me too quickly into the dosages. First two week 25 mg_ the 2nd two weeks 50mg_ the 3rd dosage was increased to 100 mg for three weeks. I did felt it stabilized my moods but the initial dosages made very tired and it was hard to concentrate at times when people talked to me but that slowly cleared up. Experienced some headaches. Experienced in the sixth week some twitching at night in my limbs. Felt dizzy at times.Noticed in the seventh week motor agitation which came in spurts and came throughout the day. Also had trouble with my gait but nothing real serious. None of this effected my driving ability. I did experience flu systems which the pdoc thought was the regular flu. I thought it was the meds....then I broke out in hives. Pdoc told me to stop ASAP.  When the rash reached my face I went to the emergency room. Got a quick dose of allergy steriods and diphenhydramine. Took a whole week for my rash to clear up.,F,52,49  days,7/10/2009Email,Lamictal cd

The stuff had horrible side effects including what I have on Lamictal and more.  I could not function on my job and still had seizures.  My doctor put me on Lamictal and I take it 3 times a day - 150 mg AM/PM and 100 at lunch.  I figured out I had seizures in the late afternoon so the lunch dose is just a little push to get me to my night time dose.  I've been seizure free for 5 years this April.That said_ sometime the side effects are pretty bad. They seem to improve or get worse with hormonal changes.  I get frustrated at the lack of strong feelings but I'm on this drug for the side effect of controlling seizures rather than the primary intention of helping bipolar.  So_ I should expect no strong feelings since it is a mood controlling drug.  However... I miss them.

The first month it felt like it had completely chanaged my life.  I was happier and higher on life than ever!  Unfortunately that didn't last.  My depression came back in full furry_ but the hypomania didn't.  So basically I felt like crap all the time.  And now sleeping problems and weight gain have become issues.  I go for days without sleeping_ but its not that I am not tired_ my body just can't sleep_ so I am sluggish and withdrawn during the day.  Kind of sucks. But_ it has only been four months_ so maybe it can still work for me.  Last time I visited the psych_ she bumped me up from 100mg to 150mg and reminded me that it was important to take the meds.  Its not like I wasn't before_ I just don't like taking them. . . but apparently I am a suicide risk_ so people get all freaked if I don't take them.  I don't know.

It changed my life completely_ Then_ by a cruel coincidence snatched away. I suggest trying it and see if it works.,M,39,2  months,11/30/2008Email,Lamictal cd
42, 4, Bipolar II,"Appetite loss_ blurred vision_ dizzy_ ""high"" feeling at first",The appetite loss has been the most severe side effect (which I dont mind_ I've lost 5 pounds so far)_ but the other side effects are eliminated completely by exercising immediately after taking the pill. I'm fortunate that I was already working out regularly before taking this medication_ but I strongly recommend trying to exercise (even walking) if one were struggling with side effects. It works for me. The drug seems to be clearing my mind as I increase the dosages (started at 25 mg_ then 50_ etc.). I played the violin when I was young and at a very definite point about 10 years ago seemed to lose my ability. Luckily I kept my violin because I seem to have picked up where I left off 10 years ago! Could be coincidental? Feel free to email me.,F,28,4  weeks,11/2/2008Email,Lamictal cd
43, 4, Anxiety_ irritability_ depression,sore throat_ weight gain_ irregular periods,I felt HUGE relief the first couple of days when I started on 25mg. Now I am on 100mg and I constantly have to drink water and tea as my throat hurts. Also have to keep clearing my throat. Got my period 2 weeks early. Overall though_ a positive effect. Will have to wean off soon as I plan to get pregnant in the near future. Also on 20mg Prozac.,F,38,6  weeks,10/11/2008,Lamictal cd
44, 2, mood disorder,"anxiety_ headache_ head feels heavy and ""stuffed up""_ ears feel plugged up_ extreme drowsiness/fatigue_ vivid dreams_ waking up a lot in the night_ mood swings.",I dont think I can do this.  I've never felt this weird on antidepressants. I've never felt bad enough that I start crying uncontrollably and get really scared to take another dose.  I was told this drug is well tolerated but I'm not tolerating it well at all!  Its only been a week but I'm going to ask my doc if I can ween off of it.,F,31,7  days,9/6/2008,Lamictal cd
45, 4, bi polar 2,scratching my head_ that's not so bad. :)  please contact me with positive experiences with this medication. that would help.,i have just started taking Lamictal and have felt relatively good this first week at 25mg.i will be increasing that dosage every week and see what happens.  while i recognize that some of the side effects are real for people on this site_ i am concentrating on relieving my depression which can become very severe regarding my bi-polar.  The balanced periods are not too severe or out of bounds_ but the depressions are paralyzing and suicidal.  i appreciate all the comments from everyone that has hadsuccess with this drug.  i am hoping it is an answer to a 25 year search for controlling the depressions i have had. Hang in there people.,M,45,7  days,8/27/2008Email,Lamictal cd
46, 3, bipolar II,vision blurry_ fuzzy-headed_ loss of creativity and enthusiasm_ sex drive MAJORLY decreased,I had the side effects described by others on this page regarding fuzzy-headedness_ dropping words_ etc._ as well as vision problems_ but I have noticed these are lessened if I take the dosage at night. I was at 100 mgs for some time and recently increased to 150_ but my sex drive is literally ENTIRELY gone.  As this is creating problems in my marriage_ I am dropping back to 125 and am going to hold there for a while to reassess.  Also general loss of creativity_ although I wonder if the loss of sex drive and creativity are because I am missing the manic phases.,F,31,1.5  years,8/26/2008,Lamictal cd
47, 4, Bipolor,Listlessness_ increased appetite_ fatigue_ insomnia.,I've been at 200 mg for over a year now. It leveled things out. The raging ended and the quick swings into depression stopped too. It was almost miraculous. Lately_ I have had almost no energy_ don't get enthused about anything any more. I feel rather zombie-like. Sleep was a problem until the doctor put me on Ambien. No problem any more.,M,50,16  months,8/15/2008Email,Lamictal cd
48, 5, bipolar II,Some: dry eye_ blurred vision_ acne_ short term memory loss_ trouble finding words_ insomnia_ vivid sometimes very strange dreams_ ulcers in mouth_ mild rashes_ the usual,Great drug_ my third time to use in the last 3 years.  The sideeffects are a mild nuisance compared to suicide and deep depression.  Had one bout of depression at 5 months this time andincreased the dosage from 100mg. to 150mg. and will soon try 200mg.  Also take 150mg. of wellbutrin upon waking and 150 mg. at noon.  Its the original fast acting parent drug.  I take it this way so it wears off before bedtime.  About the memory thing_on depressed days I couldn't remember shit then either.,M,59,6  months,8/11/2008Email,Lamictal cd
49, 5, Bi-polar II,None that I identified as side effects.,Lamictal plus Provigil really turned my life around.  I had been barely functional for 3 years prior.  But I have recently discovered that I have osteoporosis and that Lamictal interferes w/ absorption of Vitamin D and calcium.  I have also experienced severe cognitive deficits since taking the drug--memory loss_ difficulty finding words_ can't remember how to do basic arithmetic.  I am now re-thinking my use of this drug.,F,62,4  years,6/7/2008,Lamictal cd
50, 3, bipolar 2,"at first_ none. now i am experiencing agitation_ hostility_ racing negative thoughts_ dysphoria_ emotional detatchment_ ""spaced out""_ loss of creativity and motivation",at first_ no side effects and i felt better and happier than i have ever felt in my life. i was happy and confident but then i started to feel kinda detatched as i moved up on the dosage scale. then added lexapro and experienced severe agitation_ hostility and dyphoria. stopped lexapro and those symptoms worstened and i take xanax to calm me down. it helps ease the anxiety but doesnt remove it completely-just helps me forget it and move on with my day- but i don't enjoy it. i don't enjoy anything i used to. music_ movies... music used to get me through the tough times. i don't get excited about anything and my husband thinks i am unhappy in the relationship. that is not the case_ i know that deep down. i just don't care about anything. now i am at 100 mg lamictal and just don't care. i have never felt so emotionally flat. i don't feel connected to my husband whom i am normally crazy about.  i understand this stuff takes time to work and i have only been at 100 mg for 2-3 weeks.

51, 1, Mood swings,Severe back and joint pain_ 3 spine fractures_ high blood pressure_ high triglycerides.,My 15 year old son started Lamictal 150 mg at age 12. He has suffered 3 fractures in his spine_ terrible bone and joint pain_ and high blood pressure. Hasn't been in school in 3 mo. Unable to sit. Been to Cleveland - Pittsburgh had spinal epidurals_ facet injections_ MRI_ bone scans_ spect scan_ steroid inj_ physical therapy_ labwork_ took many meds -put on Enbrel IM Injections for 3 mo hoping he might have arthritis. Doctors guessed arthritis or that his pain was in his head. Turns out LAMICTAL can cause. VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY which causes high blood pressure_ elevated triglycerides_ elevated ionized calcium /PTH_ fractures AND MORE. Tapering off. Doc started 50_000IU vit D wkly. and 1000mg calcium daily. BE CAREFUL. Vit D Deficiency is serious. Have your blood checked. Lamictal can be helpful but the anticonvulsant family can cause Vit D deficiency.  Are very thankful that we know the source of his pain. We now have hope that the next weeks and months will bring relief. We thank God.,M,15,3  years,5/3/2008,Lamictal cd
52, 4, moods swings BPll,I think my side effects were non existent_ started off with very small doesage like others here_ was increased slowly to 150mg_ 75 twice daily...have experienced some weird things going on which i attribute to age and life...maybe the drug,For 15 months it was my wonder drug_ lived a very even keel life and was very happy.

54, 4, Bipolar II,short-term memory loss_ fuzzy head_ drowsiness_ inability to articulate things_ disinterest in exercise_ possibly why I keep getting sick_ lack of motivation_ indifference,In many ways this med has been wonderful- my moods are the most stable they have ever been. That said_ I am starting to feel like an idiot. I am a writer and I can't even call my children by the proper name_ let alone combine correct verbs and nouns to express myself properly. It used to only take me an hour in the morning to start functioning; now I feel like it never happens. Also_ I have little desire to do anything- I used to be physically fit and eat well_ now I have little motivation to do either. And I keep getting sick_ which never used to happen. All of this seems to be getting worse in the last four months. On 200mg_ ready to reduce my dose. Definitely won't get off all the way. Don't get all that excited about anything anymore.,F,33,15  months,4/12/2008,Lamictal cd

57, 5, bipolar,Slight weight loss immediately after weening off depakote ER.,The drug is expensive & has potentially serious rashes as possible side-effects but I would gladly pay double because it allows me to work with a clear head & doesn't make me feel lethargic nor does it make me feel as though I have no true RANGE of emotions.,M,44,2.5  years,3/26/2008,Lamictal cd
58, 4, Epilepsy,Acne,I switched to Lamictal after taking Depakote for several years.  I am currently on 100mg/day and I have no complaints other than acne.

I noticed I felt rested in the morning before I jumped to the 100mg dose causing me to have major insomnia. Going back down stopped that. I again experience restful sleep.
