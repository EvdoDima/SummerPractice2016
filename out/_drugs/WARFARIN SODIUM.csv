18, 3, Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli's,Bloating_ exhausted_ weight gain_ hard to lose weight_ legs (calves and knee) feel swollen and tight,I'm not a fan of this drug.  After a foot surgery in October 2013 I developed two blood clots in my lungs that were found in November.  The Dr. thought that my surgery and birth control pills made this happen.  Got put on Lovanox injections for a few weeks then over to Warfarin 7.5mg a day.  Seemed to be going well enough_ then had an IUD put in for excessive Menses bleeding.  After that was put in my INR levels tanked to nothing.  For about a month they upped my doses to get the levels better.  Now I take 12.5mg a day and 15mg twice a week.  I hate it.  My hair ( I have long hair) seems to want to shed everywhere_ I feel super tired_ my vision is pretty wonky sometimes.  I feel bloated and have had some weight gain that I can't get rid of.  I'm tired of being on it.  I'm hoping they let me off of it this week.  I'm getting depressed_ not sure if that is from the drug or what.

19, 3, Multiple PEs in both lungs,Severe headaches_ lightheadedness_ dizziness_ mental fog_ loss of words,Couldn't be more miserable. I developed multiple PEs after my youngest was born in Jan 2014 and have been on it since then. I will have to be on for another three months. This entire situation has destroyed my life. My postpartum bleeding never stopped and thanks to that my doctor's suggestion was to put me on depo provera which didn't stop it completely and carries a side effect of MORE PEs. Now they want me on another 10 day dose of hormones with the same potential complication. No thanks. My INR has been wonky ever since I first started on this stuff because I am breastfeeding and trying to eat a healthy diet for my baby's sake - yeah right. Like I can accomplish that easily when I'm being warned that I am better off avoiding the veggies I need to be eating. I am just now beginning to experience postpartum hair loss but it's worse than I remember it being with either of my other two children so I am wondering if this is not also thanks to the warfarin. I am so very tired of this drug and I cannot WAIT to be done with it. The day can't come soon enough. I barely feel human most of the time.,F,27,3  months10mg 1X D,4/4/2014Email,Warfarin sodium

31, 3, Deep Vein Thrombosis in Right Leg,I started taking this medicine due to a deep vein blood clot found in my right leg. The clot was caused by a perfect storm of events (according to my doctor) - heterozygous for factor v Leiden_ on a high estrogen birth control pill_ and traveling long distances for work. Once I started taking the warfarin_ I sensed that there was/is a correlation to my INR level and how fatigued/light headed/foggy I have been feeling.

I am taking 8 mg and 10 mg alternating days throughout the week.My doctor is having me stop taking warfarin in about a month since my clot has cleared  - I can't wait as I hope to return to feeling normal again.
