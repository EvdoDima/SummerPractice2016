0, 1, Nasal Congestion,,I highly recommend to stay away from this nasal spray ingredient oxymetazoline hydrochloride. Yes_ it works on clearing your sinuses_ but it becomes addictive and then it starts damaging your health. Try something more safer and non drug. I did and it works. I can't tell you what safe nasal spray I have found_ but do research on natural and safe nasal spray.  GODJESUS Bless,M,43,2  years 4X D,8/16/2012Email,Ocuclear
