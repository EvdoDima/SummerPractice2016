0, 5, seborrheic dermatitis,None.,For yrs. I used Ketoconazole cream. It didn't work.  Then I read about Xolegel 2% Gel in a medical magazine. My doc prescribed it and -- WHAMO -- my skin is gorgeous. I can't believe how well it worked. The gel works as a much better vehicle for this medication.,F,22,2  years,2/21/2008,Nizoral
1, 5, dandruff,Side Effects:  There is still dandruff on the back of my hair/scalp.,Nizoral is the best I have ever tried.  I have tried everything else_ but doesn't work.  Nizoral works however_ I have still have a little bit of dandruff in the back of my scalp.  I don't know what that means_ however_ I recommend trying Nizoral...but the price is around $14-$16_ it is well worth it!,F,25,8  months,10/10/2004,Nizoral

Has been going on for 4 weeks and only just yesterday investigated possible side effects of ketoconazole  and RXList.com notes Acute Urticaria as a KNOWN side effect to ketoconazole - but 2 doctors I went to - a PMC and a Dermatologist - both said,I think it was the combination of treatment with ketaconazole with the Nizoral - not the Nizoral alone.  ,F,48, ,9/15/2004Email,Nizoral

Nizoral was prescribed with Atarax and that MAY have intensified the reaction_ but the doc says no also. Either way -  urticaria is a KNOWN side effect of ketoconazole taken by itself w/o other meds,F,48,4  weeks,9/15/2004Email,Nizoral
