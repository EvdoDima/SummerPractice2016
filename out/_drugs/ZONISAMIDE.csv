1, 4, Epilepsy,Was on Lamictal for a couple of years and had the memory of a goldfish. When I switched to Zonisamide_ I felt so much better and clearer. One big problem... now I have 3 Kidney stones. Passing kidney stones is one of the worst kinds of pain you can imagine! Other problem_ I started having partial seizures again (thankfully not the Grand-mals)and I don't want to really up my dosage of a med that gives me kidney stones. Needless to say_ my neuro and I are looking for a new med that will work for me.,If you are taking this med_ drink LOTS of water (at least 3 quarts a day)! If you start having cloudy urine_ add lemon to the water you drink and think about calling your Dr. You may have a kidney stone.,F,29,2  years200 2X D,2/28/2011,Zonisamide
