0, 1, Migraines,Sleepiness_ nasaeous,This drug was given after my normal Imitrex wasnt lasting quite as long as before.  But Amerge wouldn't even touch the migraine at all.  Zero relief.  Guess I go back to imitrex.,F,37,3  days2.5mg,3/3/2016,Amerge

3, 4, Migraine headache,Nausea_ weak feeling in legs_ distorted sense of taste,This medication is slower to take effect than Imitrex; however_ its effects also seem to last longer.  One thing I don't like about it is that it makes the effects of the migraine (nausea_ dizziness_ malaise_ and the headache itself) worsen before they improve.  It's easy to use this medication too often_ and it won't be as effective.  When I'm in the middle of a bad migraine cycle_ where I'm getting them daily_ I rotate between Amerge and Imitrex so that neither one loses effectiveness.,F,38,100  times2.5 mg 1X D,7/5/2015Email,Amerge

5, 4, Migraine,Depression and altered my mood -- hostile_ annoyed with everything,The depression and hostile feelings only lasted the time period I was on the medicine. I took one early on the first day and one in the evening. Then one the next morning. The hostility and depression started in the evening of the first day and ended by early evening the second day.  The good news is it helped put a dent in a migraine I had been fighting for 6 weeks and had gone into my eyes causing dizziness.  I was starting to come unglued with the headache.,F,45,1.5  days 2X D,9/22/2013Email,Amerge

8, 5, Migrane Headaches,I have no apparent side effects.,"My ""magic pill""! I started taking amerge for hormonal headaches pre and post menopasaul. It is amazing after suffering for years with days in bed; within 45 minutes I can feel the headache disappearing. I am no longer missing work or worrying my family. I usually get a burst of energy for the rest of the day after the H/A is gone. Again it is a ""magic pill"".",F,59,8  years 2X M,1/22/2012,Amerge

10, 1, Migraine,Extreme drowsiness.,Amerge did nothing at all for my migraines. I had taken Imitrex for years but it stopped working. All Amerge did for me is make me really sleepy and didn't touch my migraine. It may work wonders for some_ so give it a shot! I like Frova much better!,F,39,1  months2.5 mg 1X AN,12/24/2010,Amerge
11, 5, Chronic Migraines,Slight drowsiness_ no worse than Benadryl,"I call this my ""magic"" pill! I take it on onset of symptoms (aura_ first pain) and the headache is gone in less than 2 hours. It is pricey_ and the quantity is limited by the insurance company. But_ it is worth it's weight in gold. I highly recommend it!",F,34,4  years2.5 Mg 1X AN,6/22/2010,Amerge
12, 5, Severe Migraines,The side effects are tiredness_ spacy_ some tingling in hands and feet_ dry eyes_ but the side effects are more desirable than the migraine,I have had migraines for a few years now_ but in the past year they are severe and have been destroying my life.  With a migraine I lie in bed for 3 days in the dark and vomit.  I have been taking amerge 2.5 MG for the past 4 months when the migraine starts.  Within 2 hours the migraine is just slightly painful so that I can get out of bed and do things.  I can just handle simple tasks until both the migraine is completely gone and the amerge has worn off.  I am very happy with amerge.,F,50,4  months2.5 1X AN,6/11/2010Email,Amerge
13, 3, migraines,Severe stomach ache:  12 hours after taking_ and after I eat a meal_ I get a severe stomach ache.  So severe_ I can't talk.  Stomach ache is excruciating for about 2 hours and then quickly disappears and I am fine again.,I've been taking this med for 5 years.  First 3 years_ no stomach ache.  Now_ I get the stomach ache every other time I take the med.  I've had thorough ultrasound to detect gallbladder or other issues.  It found nothing wrong.  Have never had any other stomach issues in my life.,F,44,5  years2.5 MG 1X M,5/19/2010,Amerge
14, 5, Nothing else had worked,None,"I am one of the few ""lucky"" men to experience migraines and the only thing that had ever worked for me prior to Amerge was a shot of demerol at the MD's office. However_ it's important for me to take it right away before the pain comes on (during the visual symptoms that precede the headache).  In the times I've taken it after the headache comes_ it hasn't been as effective.",M,39,5  years2.5 MG 1X D,4/3/2010,Amerge
15, 5, Severe Migraine,Minor side effects: tingling of skin and slight drowsiness.,Absolute lifesaver! After suffering migraines for 15 years_ this is the only drug that has worked for me. Maxalt_ Imitrex_ Vicodin_ Zomig and a variety of over the counter drugs didn't make a dent in the pain. My new neurologist will only prescribe 9 per month (as opposed to the originally prescribed 20) and is trying to trick me into taking Nortriptyline instead. After some research I discovered that this is an antidepressant. Has anyone else been given this and does it work for you? What is going on that insurance and doctors are against Amerge. It's obviously a miracle drug!,F,31,9  months2.5 mg 1X AN,3/16/2010Email,Amerge
16, 5, migraines,mild dizziness_ drowsiness_ feeling of heaviness in head.  some nausea_ but much more tolerable than the alternative!,I have suffered from migraines since the age of 10.  This is the first medication that has worked for me_ when taken upon the first sign of impending migraine (for me_ I get blind spots) it almost completely eliminates the migraine. If for some reason I am not able to take it immediately_ it still takes care of at least 75%.  Wish it wasn't so expensive_ but I can't imagine living without it_ it is the only thing that gives me relief.,F,36,2  years2.5mg 1X D,2/11/2010,Amerge
17, 5, Migraine,,I was in the middle of a full on migraine when I took Amerge. I wasn't sure it was going to work since I didn't take it before the migraine was full blown_ but within an hour my migraine was almost gone.  Within 2 hours it was completely gone.,F,29,1  times,12/2/2009,Amerge
18, 5, Migraines,I have had migraines for 14 years and finally there is a medicine that makes them go away or mostly away.  I'm so happy with this drug.  I have tried everything in the past_ including other triptans_ and this is the only one that works for me.,,F,37,2  months,9/22/2009,Amerge
19, 5, Migraine,spacey - tired,Best medication out there! I tried everything the doctors had and nothing worked.. Then she said last resort but it is expensive.. I am so glad I tried this medication.. I generally wait till the migraine is in full swing_ I take this med and lay down.. when I wake up a couple hours later.. poof.. migraine gone.. Thank God!I do agree the cost is a bit much.. BUT I only take when I get a strong migraine..,F,33,6  years,7/1/2009,Amerge
20, 5, Migraines,Brief drowsiness for about two or three hours after taking and a heaviness feeling in my head that lasts about four hours after taking,For the past three years since my daughter was born I have mirgraine headaches and/or bad headaches every day through the months of May and June.  After every test including allergies_ taking allergy meds_ mirgraine preventatives and a variety of pain relievers (presciption and non)....this is a miracle! Although it takes longer for the migraine pain to stop (two hours) than some other medicines_ I will be headache free for up to two days with Amerge.  It is definitely worth the wait...I get back to my old self with lots of energy!  Can't say enough.,F,41,30  days,6/23/2009,Amerge
21, 5, Migraine,Husband hasn't mentioned any.,My husband has noted that if he waits until he feels migraine pain_ the Amerge is unlikely to work at all.  However_ if he can take it at the first aura symptom (itching in back of hands_ crashing mood_ increased sense of smell)_ the Amerge prevents the migraine entirely_ or in cases where we expect a 9/10 level migraine (severe weather)_ he only reports pain of 3-5.,M,38,1  years,4/25/2009,Amerge
22, 5, Migraines,Cold extremities (same as all triptans I've taken.  Also tired and VERY spacey_ can't concentrate on anything that requires complex or sustained thought.  That said_ I can easily do housework_ child care_ and simple administrative tasks at work--just not complex planning_ writing_ or analysis (which unfortunately are the primary tasks of my job). Like others_ I'll accept this as a trade-in for the migraine pain_ no problem!,"Like all triptans_ Amerge can cause a rebound if you overmedicate (over days & weeks--not a single overdose).  Amerge  works even better if you take it with 1 tab of naproxen (google ""NSAID and triptan"" and you'll see this scientifically supported. Amerge has worked better for me than any of the previous 5 or 6 triptans I've gone thru over the years.  I am very fortunate that my neuro was able to convince my HMO (wrote a letter) that I should have 18 pills a month instead of 9_ same co-pay for me_ re: medical necessity.  It's always worth a try to see if that works with your insurer. . . .",F,42,4  years,1/23/2009Email,Amerge
23, 5, debilitating migraines,mild tiredness,I agree with all those who state here that it gave me my life back!  I tried Imitrex & Maxalt. They made me sleep but did not remove the migraine pain.  When I feel a migraine start_ or even if it has already taken hold_ it only takes 1 2.5 mg Amerge_ and an hour later I can go on with my day.  Before Amerge_ I was in bed in a dark_silent room throwing up for the day.  This drug has been a miracle for me.  I have taken it (only when I get the migraine) for probably 10 years.  Long term side effects worry me_ but when I have a migraine_ I just want that relief!  I have no other known side effects_ but if anyone knows of them (because I understand there are always trade offs with drugs)_ I'd be interested in knowing what they are.,F,57, ,1/10/2009,Amerge
24, 3, Migraines,Mood Changes_ Irregular Heartbeat_ Dizziness,It definitely gets rid of the migraine_ and it seems like I am the only person who had the really negative side effects.  However_ I stopped taking them and I still have a few pills left for my really severe migraines.  The side effects of taking the pills are more dangerous in my opinion_ for me_ than dealing with the migraine.  I have a high pain tolerance though_ but a low depression threshold.  They do work_ don't get me wrong.  The other problem is the cost.  And the packaging.  My insurance won't automatically cover it_ so we have to pay upfront.  Not worth it to me.,F,21,2  months,8/6/2008,Amerge
25, 5, Migraines,absolutely no side effects in my case.,This medicine enabled me to function normally for the first time. started having migraines in my mid-30's which lasted approx. three days at a time. Spent the days in bed with ice and in the dark. I take Amerge and the headache is gone within two hours and I very rarely have to take the second one. its been like a miracle for me.,F,52,5  years,6/9/2008,Amerge
26, 5, Migraine,,Amerge has set me free! I have been getting migraines every since I was in high school and nothing has worked. I have been through nearly all of the different migraine medicines and none of them has helped me the way Amerge has.,F,25,2  months,5/21/2008,Amerge
27, 5, Migraines,Difficulty breathing; frequent urination; some stomach upset; fatigue; poverty (during the time my insurance wouldn't cover the cost!),Agreed with many people that this drug gave me my life back; without it_ I would be completely unable to hold down a job_ that's for sure!  I've had migraines since age 8 and tried just about every new drug (and then some) to try & treat them.  Amerge has been the only tryptan-type drug that has consistently worked_ although sadly I find I need to take two 2.5mg pills now instead of one as treatment.  The difficulty breathing is not as severe as when I first started taking the drug - and I'll gladly put up with it instead of the migraine.  The only drawbacks come from my insurance company_ who at one time refused to cover the drug (and put me in the poorhouse at $30+ a pill) and now will only allow me 9 pills a month - which would be okay...if I only got 4 or 5 migraines a month. :/,F,37,10  years,5/21/2008Email,Amerge
28, 4, Migraines,None medically_ to my observation. Really bad side effect on my wallet though! The drug company should be more considerate +  control their spending on packaging of this drug to bring the price down to a realistic level! (completely immoral_the excessive PACKAGING!! ),Have had migraines since my teens & the regular off-the-shelf pain killers with coffee used to work.  When that eventually stopped working_ I was grateful for this drug (& my drug plan!)The generic version can't come soon enough!,F,53,5  years,3/23/2008,Amerge
29, 5, Migraines,A little drowsy at times.,I have been taking amerge for 14 years.  It works wonderful and gave me my life back.  I have taken as many as 18 in one month with no bad side affects.  Prior to this I took Imitrex shots and pills for 3 years and this lasts much longer.,F,52,14  years,3/18/2008Email,Amerge
30, 5, Migraine,Groggy_ tired_ nasueated_ at times felt fire running through my viens. Sometimes no side effects.  Depended on severity of migraine. All side effects were worth it and less severe than any migraine.,I have had headaches since I was 15.  Amerge is the only medicine that I felt has helped when I felt a headache coming on. I used to make 3-4 trips in a year to the ER to get a shot_ but since taking Amerge_ I've had about 4 trips in the past 7 years. The times that it doesn't work are few and far between compared to when it does help.  My mother and her sisters take Amerge also.,F,41,7  years,1/11/2008Email,Amerge
31, 4, Migraine Headaches,Fatigue (though that could be from the migraine).  Horrible rebound headache - having taken 8 Amerge in one month.,As I've come to my 30's_ I've gone from having the occasional migraine that required 1 or 2 Amerge_ to having them more frequently.  This month_ I've taken 8_ and am experiencing a /horrible/ situation with a rebound headache.  That said_ I'm also on some other medications for Fibromyalgia_ and neuropathy.  Amerge has always been wonderful at alleviating migraines_ and I heartily recommend it.  In my case_ a medication caused migraines that lasted weeks into months_ and I don't recommend trying to treat with Amerge constantly.  You'll get heart dysrhythmias and possibly a relentless rebound headache situation.,F,35,7  years,11/6/2007,Amerge
32, 5, migraines,It may cause sleepiness_ but to go to sleep for a while seems to help the Amerge work better. I wouldn't notice any bad side effects from the Amerge because the migraine side effects are much worse anyway.,I've tried many migraine drugs_ surgery and preventions.  The very best treatment is still Amerge.  I only wish it would last longer than 24 hours. I feel like Cinderella! My vision clears up. The brain fog_ the intense pain and muscle tension is helped greatly. It is the best day when I finally take the Amerge!,F,57,7  years,10/3/2007Email,Amerge
33, 5, migraine,A little neck discomfort about 1/2 to an hour after first taking pill which goes away after about 30 minutes or so and doesn't return.,I have never had anything work as well as Amerge.  It lasts a long time - 20-24 hours.  Must take it at first sign of migraine for it to be most effective.  It does make me a little drowsy_ but I can function and work and take care of my family.  I don't know what I would do without this medicine!,F,41,8  years,7/28/2007,Amerge
34, 5, migraine headaches,The Amerge blocked my thinking even more than the migraine did_ but it was very effective in getting rid of the migraine.  The following day I usually felt like I'd had the flu_ but don't know if that's due to the migraine or the Amerge.,,F,50,5  years,5/1/2007,Amerge

36, 5, Migraines,Tired,I have had migraines since I was a young teenagers. I missed many days of work and school and first tried Imitrex which didn't work. I am so thankful for Amerge as I have been successful with it. I live in Canada and for 6 pills it is about $100 which is expensive but thankfully I have coverage and don't have to pay. Although_ even if I did_ I would because it's worth it being able to function and lead a normal life. I don't know what I would do if this stopped working.,F,30,3  years,3/31/2007Email,Amerge
37, 5, Migraines,Cold and tired - but that could be migraine side effects too.,Sometimes it takes awhile to work_ and sometimes I need to take a second one 4 hours later_ but it usually works very well for migraines.  Imitrex never worked for me.,F,50,7  years,2/27/2007,Amerge
38, 5, Migraine,None,Have been a migraine sufferer for seven years and was never prescribed anything until Amerge.  It eliminated the headache within an hour and gives me back my life!  I don't know about other medications_ but this one helps me tremendously.,F,21,2  weeks,1/18/2007,Amerge
39, 5, migraine,Thank God for Amerge. Sometimes I get a little spacey or cold extremities_ but I can get my kids to school and myself to work. I routinely take it two to three times a month.,,F,45,3  years,9/25/2006,Amerge
40, 5, migraines,I feel tired for the next few hours after taking one tablet,I had tried many different drugs prior to Amerge without success.  Amerge actually stops my migraines within 1 hour - I am ever so grateful and go nowhere without Amerge.,F,44,3  years,9/19/2006,Amerge
41, 5, Migraines,Some times feel a little spacey_ but not drowsy,I have had migraines for over 20 years and Amerge is a god send. It works for me EVERY time that I take it_ unlike Imitrex_ which I took in the 1990s. I have almost no side effects with Amerge. I can't say enough about how it has positively impacted my life.,F,46,7  years,7/28/2006,Amerge

43, 5, for migraine,by itself I was fine maybe a little tired_ when I take it with my Neurontin I feel dizzy and more tired...,I think it works better for menstrual migraines than regular even though I still use it for regular migraine.  It also seems to last longer than most meds I've tried (about 26 hours),F,40,6  months,5/25/2006,Amerge

The drug appears to slow me down_ which helps the medicine overtake the migraine.,Take at first signs of migraine pain_ and give it a chance to kick-in (slow down!).  Waiting too long to address your pain will cause the drug to be ineffective.  I've suffered from migraines for 22 years_ and this drug is a miracle drug for me.

51, 5, chronic migraines,I was taking Imitrex shots and pills prior to the Amerge tablets for the last year and they did not always end the h/a pain.  I also had the nasty Imitrex side effect of a worsening h/a for 15 minutes after injection before I received any relief. It was always so nerve racking.  I have been taking the Amerge (almost daily) for a week now and have had no side effects to speak of (maybe a little drowsy). Also_ in one instance it only took one pill to get rid of a h/a I almost went to the E.R. with.  The Amerge also takes a little longer to work; 1.5 to 2 hrs for last headache but the h/a slowly vanished. I am thrilled so far and no more shots!,,F,34,1  weeks,1/12/2005,Amerge
