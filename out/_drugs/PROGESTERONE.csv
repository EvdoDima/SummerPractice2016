0, 3, must take with vivelle dot/estrogen,Drowsy_ some general feelings of weakness_ lower back pain_ mild uterine cramps without menstruation_ increased hot flashes.,"Reading the comments here_ it sounds like I just stumbled into an emergency room in a war zone. I would remind readers that these reviews do not take into consideration any other ailments_ disorders or medications - from these ""reviews"" I have no idea what progesterone is really actually doing or not doing to everyone else; just wanted to share my experience.",F,51,2  weeks200 3X W,7/9/2016,Progesterone
1, 1, Hvy painful period& tubular breasts,Extreme sudden hair loss on top of head! Can't sleep at all during luteal phase of menstrual cycle when I never had a bad night's sleep in my life! Racing heart! Highly irritable! Extreme anxiety with panic attacks and nervous hand tremors!,"I have heard of this ""helping"" some women.  (But it also will shut down your body's own natural production of it with prolonged use) It made my periods worse (how was that even freaking possible?!) I still can't sleep almost a year later. All I do is research how to fix this and my husband can't stand how obsessed I am. I hate doctors that don't truly want to help people. The choice is yours if u decide to take this_ but beware of this so-called natural_ bio-identical hormone from hades!",F,30,3  months40 mg 2X D,6/17/2016,Progesterone
2, 1, Pms_ mood swing,First I was given a bhrt pill from the PA that treated me. It was 50mg of progesterone_ 25mg testosterone_ 5mg of DHEA. After 6  weeks she went up on the dosage. I felt horrible and fat!  I was going about 8 weeks until I had a period_ but cramping and bloating and emotional. After testing my hormones again_ she changed me to a cream. My progesterone had dropped and estergen skyrocketed past 650.  I'm still having problems with the cream. Had a period two weeks apart. I called the PA today and she basically told me she wasn't sure what to do with me. I'm wearing myself off the hormones. I'm going to continue to take armour thyroid 90mg. This has been a very expensive_ horrible experience.,Progesterone made me feel horrible. I was bloated_ gained weight_ more tired_ emotional and depressed.,F,39,6  months50mg cream,6/16/2016Email,Progesterone
3, 1, Pre-Menopause,"After having night sweats_ mood swings_ lack of libido_ etc it was determined I would benefit from hormone therapy.  Estradial hormone patch .025MG and Progesterone (Cylic) 12 days of cycle.  At first it seemed to help.  However_ my mood swings are now much worse_ depression has been much worse (I take an antidepressant and have increased that).  I don't feel like me_ I'm tired_ can't focus_ I'm not motivated_ I have extreme swings in emotion and have rage with irritation. Concerned I went back to doctor to see what they could do.  They basically ran bloodwork and said my estrogen was in the ""Normal"" level...so I don't need to increase my estrogen.  I started researching the Progesterone and I now believe it is the culprit.  I have decided to stop the Estrogen and Progesterone and try some more natural remedies because at this rate it is NOT worth it.",,F,51,8  months100MG 1X D,6/13/2016Email,Progesterone
4, 1, endometriosis,extreme breast tenderness and swelling_ depression_ severe weight gain_ fatigue_ bloating_ severe mood swings_ joint pain_ heavy and very painful periods,This cream ruined my body. I read how using it can greatly help people suffering with endometriosis pain.I was so optimisitc and gladly dished out hundreds of dollars and kept telling myself those were all just temporary side effects. I hate my body more than ever right now_ as I gained 14+ pounds in the time I used the cream. I eat a very clean and balanced diet_ and excercise like a fiend. this has ruined my self esteem_ as well as my sex life with my partner. I have fat deposits all over my body that were never ever there before. seeing myself naked is shocking_ as I have an entirely different body now thanks to this horrible cream. My mood was so doom and gloom that i actually thought about breaking up with my boyfriend and being alone. It makes you mentally sick.

I didn't realize it at the time but it made my hair fall out and my sleep issues worse.  So I went to the doctor and she told me it was prob not enough and wrote me an rx.  My symptoms got even worse.  Just stay away.  Do not take it!!!  I have been off of progesterone for 7 months now and am slowly getting better.

7, 1, Tested low / estrogen dominance,Severe panic attacks_ heart palpitations_ shortness of breath_ sensations of anxiety/unease_ crying spells_ dizziness_ acne_ sweating_ fatigue.,Thank you all for taking time to post your experiences with this drug. I wish I would have read this sooner.  I was prescribed  progesterone cream_ adrenal support superman and thyroid medication.  I am highly sensitive to medication so I took only half of the dose for 21 days. I actually felt okay until week 3 when out of nowhere I had a panic attack at work.  Since then I have an ongoing feeling of unease and anxiety that changes to extreme sadness throughout the day. It is very difficult to concentrate. I do not have a history of panic attacks and have never contemplated suicide until this all started. Thank goodness I found this website because I thought I was going crazy.  I actually started psychotherapy 2 weeks ago because I did not know what was going on. I stopped taking this 5 days ago. I feel a little better but still have anxiety and a general feeling of unease.   I would love to know how long it took others to completely heal from this.,F,35,3  weeks40mg,5/8/2016Email,Progesterone
8, 1, ,SWELLING_ INSANE fatigue_ stomach pain_ nausea_ disturbing clots passed during period_ the horrible depression.,What is wrong with Drs.?! I slept for 6 DAYS round the clock_ I thought I had a flu...then the crying started_ and shaking hands_ paranoia_ extreme sadness...and I BRIKE UP WITH MY BOYFRIEND_ who I love dearly...(he held on tight_ thank you Lord)...I thought this was me as well_ I pushing suicidal thoughts away all weekend. I read this_ that's it. No more for me. I tried to tell my GYN that I progesterone (Promeitrium) does NOTHING good for my hormonal swings. She dismissed me and said I don't think you have taken this before: but I HAD. At age 30_ compounded at first then the brand. SAME EXACT REACTIONS. Honestly_ the pill_ with a balance of hormones_ may be synthetic_ but I'd rather risk the side effects then to risk suicidal and psychotic behavior. SHAME on the MD's who say 'Oh_ it can't be what I prescribed_ I've never seen a reaction like that before.' REALLY!!!!??? You are clearly not in research for a reason. Nice to meet you. I told her! I told her. Take such good care of yourselves my girls out there. Thanks for reality check. You all probably saved a life tonight.,F,48,1  weeks100mg,5/2/2016,Progesterone
9, 3, Fatigue_ovarian cysts_fibro.breasts,Rash_ dizziness ONLY when pharmacy changed brand to Akorn generic (round dark pink pill with an AK on it). I had no reaction to the round peach pill with SV on it taken prior_ Solvay now AbbVie. (While I had a partial hysterectomy about 10 years ago_ I still have my ovaries and am still ovulating_ but have significant hormone imbalance- extreme fatigue_ inability to recover from exercise_ developed ovarian cysts_ dense fibrocystic breast tissue. The SV brand helped somewhat with these symptoms.),Ask what brand the pharmacy carries! Even generics differ from one another. From reading about the differences_ progesterone capsules from different companies vary in purity. (Sometimes it's the fillers or dyes that differ.) I read that many people experience reactions to Teva generic brand as well.,F,46,8  months100 mg,4/10/2016Email,Progesterone
10, 1, Premenopause,My doctor told me the bioidentical compound was going to fix all the concerns I was having from my migraines to sex drive. Well_ I'm glad I found this site because I thought I was going crazy.. between the anger issues to not having the energy (strenght maybe a better word ) to move. I have always been active_ yes had days my body just didn't want to cooperate but never to this extent. I feel like I have cement running through my veins... prior to starting the bioidentical progesterone I had registered for several races and now I can barely make it up my stairs. I actually thought I had ms_ but I'm going g to stop taking the progesterone to see if that helps. I read the one woman's comment about being so angry she wanted to leave her husband_  kick her kids out of the house etc. This week I missed work due to having a major break down.

I woke up feeling sick and VERY nervous. That quickly turned into a full blown panic attack and I felt like I was losing my mind. I was shaking_ sick to my stomach_ everything seems surreal and weird. My face felt numb and tingly and my head started to hurt. I called my Dr. right away. She said to take the progesterone maybe every 3rd day instead_ at night and also to half my already tiny dose .5mg of estrogen. I agreed to try that by immediately decided to never_ ever take that pill again! I have sent her a note requesting to try a cream instead and that way I can better monitor how much I am getting. I don't even want to try that to be honest because now I am terrified of ever feeling like that again. I'm happy for the gals who don't get bad side-effects from this horrid drug but I am warning you other who are thinking of trying it....these posts are NOT overreactions!

I feel less bloated_ thinking more clearly and just feel MUCH better than I have in a long time. I even have more energy. I am going to start taking it at night though and try to avoid those wonky feelings after first taking my dose. This is only day 8 so who knows what lays ahead.

46, 3, Estrogen Dominance,Dry eyes_ anxiety_ hypoglycemia_ uncontrollable shaking_ brain fog_ panic attacks_ feelings of unreality,I took both compounded topical progesterone and Pro Gest creams under the guidance of a doctor.  I was initially prescribed the progesterone for estrogen dominance symptoms (extreme anxiety) and it worked WONDERFULLY......for 5 months.  I felt normal.  Then my symptoms reverted back and they got progressively worse.....anxiety every day instead of just the week before my periods.  Looking back now_ I should have either stopped using it or at least cut down on the frequency and dose but my doctor actually told me to use more.  So here I am now...with 15x more in my saliva than I should have.  I stopped cold turkey and am in Day 7 of my detox.  The symptoms are still really bad if not worse than before.  Am seeing a different doctor to find out how to get this out of my system.  Please use with caution and listen to your body....most doctors do not understand how to use this stuff.  Just because you can get it in a health food store does not make it safe.  And all the glowing reviews on line ....haven't we read all of those??  Learn from my mistake.....I have.,F,49,1.5  years30-80mg 1X D,2/24/2015,Progesterone

49, 1, to stop hair loss created by Estrac,Severe stomach muscle cramps_ dry mouth_ clicking in every part of my body_ couldn't eat_ can't sleep_ hypothryroid reaction_ no energy_ severe lethargy_ feeling of dryness throughout body_ depression_ weird dreams_ hair feels very abnormal and dry_ bloating in stomach_ tired but wired sensation at night_,I should have known better!  I had tried natural progesterone during perimenopause_ and simply hated it.  But_ experienced severe scalp itching and hair loss due to vaginal Estrace.  Thought maybe some counter balance might help.  Just a small amount_ less than 1/4 tsp._ sent me into a tailspin.  Then a doctor decided that I needed to take a small 25mg of progesterone for 6 weeks.  I didn't make it two.  All the side effects listed are from that little 25mg. daily.  Does anyone know how long it will take to get well again?  I feel awful_ haven't been on it for 3 1/2 weeks_ but still feel the effects.,F,58,14  days25mg 1X D,1/11/2015Email,Progesterone
50, 1, Perimenopause_ hot flashes,What a mistake!  I had been experiencing unpleasant night sweats due to perimenopause and my MD gave me some literature on ways to reduce its symptoms.  So I bought Progest cream at a health food store.,I used the product as directed.  The first 3 days_ no side effects and no night sweats.  After that_ extreme lethargy_ sleepiness_ depression_ anxiety_ nausea and heartburn set in_ to be followed by the shakes_ uncontrollable thoughts_ fears_ nightmares .... it was horrid. I stopped on the 11th day_ experienced the above symptoms for about 2 more days_ and now  a total of 5 days has passed_ and I'm only 50% back to normal.  I am improving daily_ but I suspect it will take a few more weeks or a month.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  There is a reason why we experience menopause and its symptoms_ we should not interfere with how the body is supposed to work.  I would never recommend progesterone or any other HRT.  I'm going to ride menopause out like my grandmother and great-grandmothers.,F,44,11  days20mg/1/8 2X D,1/5/2015,Progesterone
51, 1, Tested Low,I used a compounded progesterone cream.  Anxiety_ heart palpitations_ cystic acne_ hair shedding_ insomnia_ weird carpal tunnel feelings in both arms that fluctuates. Pins and needles feeling in arms fingers_ ravenous hunger. Extremely loose joints.,Soooo... do not use this drug. It is dangerous! It worked great for 3 weeks_ but is has caused more problems. If you used progesterone cream (like on your arms) then you suddenly develop weird sensations in your arms weeks later. Don't be alarmed. It is the toxic overload from the cream in your body! Drink rose petal tea and do some juicing to get the toxins out. This has been helpful. Also think about taking a liquid iron supplement if you are still having periods.  Also try Vitex (herb) to raise your progesterone. Its gentle and has GREATLY helped with my anxiety. Thank you Jesus!!! The Lord gave me a dream to take vitex.. it takes time but is helping. I'm sleeping more. Also think about low doses of B6_ vitamin C_ and Curcumin if you are having acne. All these things have helped me.. and I can tell my progesterone has started come up on its own with the help of these supplements after being off this cream for a month. This drug has been HORRIBLE and others need to know the side effects... there are many! I wish I would read up before I took it. I hope this post will help anyone struggling with the same issues. I am HEALING everyday! Be careful.,F,34,5  weeks40-80mg 1X D,1/2/2015Email,Progesterone
52, 1, Premenopausal,Unless your body produces zero progesterone do not take this drug. It caused anxiety_ heightened awareness of everything good and bad_ irritability and puts you in a fog.,Take care of yourself. Eat right and exercise.

53, 1, Estrogen Dominance,I was having a lot of anxiety and insomnia along with some depression_ and irregular periods.  After saliva testing_ I was told by my naturopath that I am estrogen dominant_ and the solution was to take this bioidentical (derived from wild yams) progesterone lozenge 2 x day for the last two weeks of my cycle.  I lasted only 6 days on this stuff.  I will say that during the first few days_ my anxiety felt much better.  However_ on the third day I started getting night sweats_ my sleep worsened_ and on the 6th day I began spotting.  I then got my period a week early_ and stopped taking the progesterone as I was told to do if I got my period.  The next day I had vertigo.  I was quite depressed for a few days_ it was awful.  My depression got a bit better as time went on over the next week.  I was told to take it again in my next cycle after I saw signs of ovulation_ so I did.  After just 1 dose_ I felt instantly more anxious_ my mind was racing and I just felt not right.  A few hours late,I do feel that you need to listen to your body.  Do not believe them when they tell you that you need to give it at least 3 cycles to level out.  While that may be true for some_ our hormones are always changing.  You truly need to get tested often_ keep a journal_ and track everything to find out your dose and when you should be taking it.  I personally do not want to continue focusing on trying to find the magic dose and timing to make this stuff work for me.,F,36,6  days12.5 mg 2X D,11/29/2014Email,Progesterone

55, 1, Heavy menstrual periods_ PMS,Difficulty breathing_ rapid heartbeat_ debilitating anxiety_ panic attacks_ major depression_ oily skin and cystic acne_ insomnia_ loss of concentration and brain fog to the point where I began failing all my classes_ excessive appetite_ bloating_ extreme anger_ short-term memory loss...,"Shittiest thing I've ever done to myself. Symptoms began right after I started the cream_ told the doctor_ who told me they were ""normal"" and would go away_ foolishly continued using it_ getting more and more angry/depressed/anxious until I almost killed myself two days ago with an overdose of sleeping pills. Nearly failed all of my classes this semester_ broke up with my very loving boyfriend because I felt so bad that he had to deal with me like this_ withdrew from all social activity_ and spent days and days just lying at home sleeping all day with the shades drawn_ crying or raging or just trying to breathe. One time_ I was running up the stairs and when I got to the top my heart was beating so fast that I felt nauseous and dizzy_ and threw up in the bathroom. My resting heart rate while on this cream went all the way up to 120 at some point. Scarily heavy periods with the worst cramps ever. Best thing that ever happened to me was running out of this cream and being too depressed and fatigued to go to my doctor's appointment. Every day after that I felt better_ and now_ two weeks later_ I am starting to feel a tiny bit better.",F,22,3  months20mg 3X D,11/14/2014Email,Progesterone

I also developed odd food sensitivities_ and terrible insomnia.  NOTHING helped.  You name it_ I tried it.  I tried sleeping pills_ I saw naturepaths_ chiropractors_ massage_ meditation_ Paleo diet... NOTHING helped.","From what I gather_ this poison RUINED my intestinal flora.
