2, 3, i wasn't able to afford it,I am 24 female in Tennessee_ I have suffered migraines daily and am constantly in excruciating pain for the last 13 years. I tried to get a rx for this Med and I was able to get it. I have read countless reviews from others that use this drug. The problem. I went to the pharmacy to get it filled and it was gonna cost me $1_500 I almost fell o er dead right there on the pharmacy. That is ridiculous. I have no insurance_ and have to pay cash for everything_ which I'm not complaining about that because I believe that if I need it_ ill pay for it_ but I couldn't afford this and I feel like on losing hope_ I have tried all the beta blockers_ triptans_ numerous preventives_ ergots_ even depression meds_ and anti seizure meds_ nothing works so I was excited to try this. This is ridiculous. Does anyone know how I might be able to get this Med at a discounted price? I have contactes Valeant Pharmaceuticals and haven't heard anything back. I don't know what to do. I don't just have headaches_ I have migraines that last 2-3 months at a time. And when the migraine finally goes away I will get another one within 3-4 days that will also last for months at a time. I need help and I don't know who else to contact about this. Any advice or helpful information is extremely_ greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance.,,F,24,1  days0 mg,10/6/2013Email,D.h.e. 45

4, 5, Migraines,none,I am so thankful for this drug.  I was having severe migraines 2-3 times a month and having to go to the ER at least once a month for treatment.  Now I can give myself an injection and it is gone in 20 minutes.  I don't have to ask someone take me to the ER and then take care of my children while I sleep off the medication given in the ER.,F,34,4  months 1X AN,5/20/2011Email,D.h.e. 45
5, 5, Migraines,None at all,I have had migraines since I was 9 I am now 24 B4 getting these injections I had tried EVERYTHING all triptans such as imitrex just to list one people are familiar with I did bio-feedback therepy I also did physical therapy for my neck and shoulders_ I tried anti-seizure meds such as topamax and I did the diet taking out all things I mean its been years of trying it all some many scans and a lot of hospital visits which are hard b.c they think your seeking pain meds when all I wanted was relief I also have tried against my better judgment but I hate pain management I don't want to mange my pain I want it gone and to know whats causing it to begin with so I have tried stadol once and it made me so so sick most pain meds do I am not a large person at all my migraines typically last three days and I have a sever migraine weekly sometimes twice weekly which means six days a week the diet did help I have A LOT of triggers..chocolate_ onions_ tomatoes_ avocados_ MSG...the list is endless lol anything good makes me sick :( but I went to a new doctor along with my regular Neurologist and I tried the five day hospital stay for the DHE treatment AGAIN...and I was still sick afterward I still was taking my midrin if needed but was told to try my hardest not too...I was still sick and my doc. put me on the injections DHE 45 when I have a migraine I cant get shake and would normally go to the hospital for...and IT WORKS....THE HEADACHE GOES COMPLETELY AWAY NOTHING has ever worked I am so,F,24,4  months,9/17/2009,D.h.e. 45
6, 5, Severe Migraines,None that I remember.,Injection every 8 hrs in hosp f/3 days. On 3rd day severe migraines started again & they gave me Toradol to help w/the pain.  The migraines continued f/2 more days. I fought thru the pain & tears. Under my Doctor's advisement I did'nt take percocet(narcotic)for pain and took toradol instead. It was well worth the 3 days of pain because now my migraines are manageble. I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis(MS)5 years ago. There's no cure for MS_but my migraines are under control & I'm thrilled!,F,47,3  days,5/28/2009Email,D.h.e. 45
7, 5, Severe migraines,Nothing material_ a little nausea once.,This is a far better option than pills. The rebound effect is eliminated and the results are consistently better than other drugs I've used over the past 20 years.,M,54,1  years,3/30/2008,D.h.e. 45

9, 1, 4 month long migrain,Went into a Brady code_ Heart rate dropped to 30 beats a minute_ cold and pale_ coldness in fingers/hands and feet_ severe mood change (anger/ anxiety),I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  The contraindications for the drugs are long.  I thought I was going to die_ and now my migrain is worse than ever_ and am back on dilaudid (strong pain medicine)_ again.  If I was given all the information prior to use_ I would not have had the injection at all.,F,35,1  days,7/24/2007,D.h.e. 45
10, 4, Chronic Migraines,nausea,I take Ondansetron for the nausea about 1/2 hour before the DHE.  The shots are annoying but I get longer relief than from the nasal spray. (at least 48 hours)  I'm not convinced this is the answer but at least I am off the triptans and analgesics that have a higher incidence of rebound.,F,41,1  months,7/17/2007,D.h.e. 45
11, 4, migraine,diarrhea and joint stiffness,I've been using DHE for 17 years.  It works very well for me.  I currently have 2 to 3 migraines a month_ down from 5 or 6 when they started 27 years ago.  Prior to using DHE I would have to go to the ER for injections that put me to sleep for a full day.  I highly recommend DHE45 but I do wonder how long it is safe to contrict/dilate blood vessels with this or any other  vasoconstricting drug.,F,59,17  years,3/11/2007Email,D.h.e. 45
12, 1, migraines,tightness in chest_ headache was worsened with each injection_ pain in legs_ my body/immune system was weakened after treatment and my head still hurts.  I have been on bed rest for a while.,I do not believe doctors have done enough research.  I would not recommend this treatment to anyone else.,F,34,4  days,9/30/2006,D.h.e. 45
13, 2, migraines,nausea_ possibly tremors,I had 4 doses_ and before the DHE was given_ they gave reglan. the 4th time_ i experienced very bad side effects from the reglan: dystonic reactions_ and tremors (not sure if it was caused by reglan or DHE).I stopped getting more doses because of the side effects_ and it barely helped the migraine i've had for months.,F,14,2  days,5/17/2006,D.h.e. 45
