0, 3, weightloss,Brainfog from RA subsided. Chronic fatigue from RA subsided. Allowed me to stop using steroid treatment first time in three years (since onset of disease). I feel as though I have awoken from a comatose state. Amazing drug in that regard.,As far as weightloss goes_ this drug does not work by itself_ one must be fully committed. In that regard I have managed to lose 8 pounds in less than two months. Losing this weight has required me to stay focused on other things rather than what to eat next. I think Contrave has helped. Whenever I feel hungry_ I prepare hot green tea or water with lemon instead of getting a snack. This medicine allows my mind to accept these refreshing drinks as a replacement for food whereas before I could not stop fixating on eating.,F,51,57  days8/80 4X D,4/22/2016Email,Contrave
