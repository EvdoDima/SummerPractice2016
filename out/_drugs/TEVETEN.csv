0, 5, High blood pressure,Almost no side effects.  I've had none of the joint pain or stomach acid that I had daily while on Atacand.  Some days my sinuses seem a bit more sensitive to smells.  I feel mentally clear and have no fatigue while on Teveten.  My circulation in my extremities has also improved.  ,I asked my doctor for Teveten after trying lots of different blood pressure meds in the past. I was running out of blood pressure medications to try and saw the high rating on this site.  I'm glad I pushed the doctor to precribe this med as its very well tolerated.  My insurance company covers it because I had angioedema while on Altace.,M,49,6  months,5/23/2016,Teveten
1, 5, High Blood Pressure,Absolutely none.,I have been taking various BP drugs for years....and have either had rashes or headaches from most of them.
