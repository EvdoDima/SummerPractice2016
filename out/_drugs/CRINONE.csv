0, 3, Infertility,Uncomfortable with the amount of vaginal discharge after use_ had to use a pantyliner.,I will continue to use crinone gel because I am trying to get pregnant and if I do it will be worth it_ but it is kind of gross.,F,30,2  days,1/22/2010,Crinone
1, 2, Perimenopause,Excessive discharge requiring use of a pantiliner.Unsightly_ pellet-like discharge of gel build-up during coitus.,I was prescribed Crinone 8% gel to be used for uterine protection_ in conjunction with Vivelle Dot 0.025 patch.  Due to the messiness of the gel_ I requested to be switched to Prometrium 100mg capsules after using it for only 3 days.  I liked the idea of physically applying progesterone specifically where needed without a full systemic effect.  However_ it just wasn't worth the mess and inconvenience!,F,41,3  days,7/13/2006,Crinone
