0, 3, Osteoporosis,The only side effects experienced were a slight amount of heartburn on occasion when eating fruits with high acid content and some stomach pain_ but very intermittently_ and only the first two years.,I started taking Atelvia four years ago for osteoporosis. It was great being able to take this medication immediately after eating breakfast.  After two years_ my dexa scan showed an improvement in bone density to the level of osteopenia. I have been taking calcium and do weight bearing exercise on a regular basis_ so I was shocked when my latest dexa scan this year showed a slight decrease in bone density to the level of osteoporosis. My doctor suggested trying an IV infusion treatment or continuing Atelvia for another year and another dexa next year. I determined that the IV option was not a good idea for me_ due to the long term possibility of side effects. Now I have a dilemma - my new healthcare provider does not cover Atelvia at all. Paying out of pocket would cost me nearly $5000 for the whole year.  The only covered options are generic actonel or fosamax. She also suggested Evista_ but due to family history of stroke and heart disease_ this is not a risk I want to take. It would be nice if there was a generic version of Atelvia available.,F,62,4  years35 MG 1X W,7/7/2015,Atelvia
