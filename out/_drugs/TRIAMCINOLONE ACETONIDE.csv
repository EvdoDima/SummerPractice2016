0, 4, Scar infiltration,Muscular pain_ joint pain_ skin rash_ sore throat,This is the 2nd time i take steroids and i discovered i am sensitive to it. Only a small injection to infiltrate a scar and i am knocked out. The first time i took prednisone felt similar effects. Scar is not iching anymore and seems to be better in appearance. It's only two days though.,F,38,1  days 1X D,11/25/2015Email,Triamcinolone acetonide
1, 1, Itchy rash,Greasy_ thick_ slow to absorb. Steroids can be dangerous.,Did not work for itching_ redness or swelling of skin.  Itching subsided only minutes before returning worse then ever! Not worth the risks involved with taking a steroid if it doesn't do anything.,F,32,2  days.10 2X D,6/9/2010,Triamcinolone acetonide
