0, 5, Afib,I had the common metallic taste for about six months.  I've been on it four years this month_ and it has completely controlled my episodes of Afib.

1, 1, A-fib,Converted to sinus rhythm_ but cardiologist wanted to experiment with Rythmol as pill-in-a-pocket rescue drug. Almost immediately after taking_ heart rate skyrocketed and felt like it was pushing me back into afib. Side effects lasted for about a month from that single dose. Will never again try any Class III antiarrhythmic.,Judging from online comments_ doesn't seem to work very reliably. Probably best to avoid.,M,51,1  days150mg,4/28/2016,Rythmol

10, 1, Intermittent A-Fib,Severe (near debilitating) muscle cramps in shoulders_ groin_ upper thigh.  So severe that Tylenol and Naproxen did not help much.  This began within a day of taking the medication.Cardiologist thought it may have been one of the other meds causing the issue and changed them.   At day 23 I could no longer take the pain and wouldn't take it anymore.  At day 24_ the cardiologist agreed to take me off it.  It's been near three weeks and the remnants of the pains still shoot through my shoulders.   However_ I can now move my arms without a huge amount of pain.  It slowly is all coming back.,I'm sure Rythmol works for some folks but for me_ the severe muscle cramps was too much.,M,45,24  days325 1X D,4/23/2015Email,Rythmol
11, 3, Diagonised with SVT/ afib,Weakness_ blurred vision _ acid reflux _ stomach burning _ swears_ a little bit of chest pain. ( but pretty sure this was all part of the healing process),I have been on rhythmol for two weeks now following a catheter ablation done by my electrophysiologist .. He prescribed me rythmol 350 mg 2x daily along with 25 mg of toporal (beta blocker ) after coming home from the hospital I was having bad side effects (stomach acid_ dizzy_ confusion_ blurred vision_ weak _ I felt awful all over ) I could not tell if these were side effects from the drugs or from the healing process of the surgery ...  After  about 6 days I skipped a day of Meds to see if the side effects would subside .... By noon that day I was feeling worst than ever so took them again and right away felt better about an hour after .  So that answered my question. I haven't hd any episodes of a high heart rate.. I am scheduled for another ablation in 6 weeks but hopefully the rythmol will keep working for me until then.,F,23,2  weeks350mg,3/16/2015,Rythmol

I have had an implantable cardiac monitor (Medtronic LINQ) inserted into my chest and hope that the doc can finally get some solid data from this gadget and a better diagnosis instead of doing the 'best guesses' with these damn pills.

Had a bad episode on Christmas of last year when I caught the flu and the doc gave me a cough med that had a bad reaction with the atenolol. Causing my heart to bounce between 145 to 185 bpm.  Ended up in the hospital for a couple of days.  The doctor wanted to do an ablation but now they say the success rate isn't good enough.  Think I'm going to get a second opinion.

But overall the medicine works great for me I can deal with the minor side effects because it's so much better than dealing with the Afib..

Had an occular migraine day #3 (no pain_ just swirling lights and colors in left eye) and wonky little pains in head.   high pitched ringing in ears.  Appetite decrease_ initally constipated_ but that resolved with adding more fiber foods to diet.  GERD/mild burpy condition_ especially on rising_ taking medicine for that.,Praying I will not be taking this long; 12 days ago_ just had my 2nd ablation and placed on this for support during post ablation healing period.  This is my 5th AFIB drug in the two yrs I've had it (lone AFIB type). Either my second (touch-up) ablation has worked (praying so) or this meicine is working in conjunction_ because I have had no bad AFIB eipsodes since ablation...:)  I have been on 5 meds and all caused side effects_ I am really sensitive to these meds (beta blockers and this class too)...+ didnt eliminate my lone AFIB. therefore ablations. About my recent burpy GERD_ which I never experienced  before these meds_ (I dont eat a diet to cause this)  I have seen GI dr and told developing GERD can come from channel blockers and other  rhythm meds.  keep the faith everyone.  report whats not working for you to your Cardio EP.  stay after it.  AFIB and meds to treat it have many possible side effects...which can really bring you down.  aside from AFIB I am in great health..best wishes to all.,F,45,11  days225 2X D,8/12/2011Email,Rythmol

31, 4, arrythmia & palpatations,Last year my heart started fluttering and having palpatations. There were no other symptoms. I went to the er and they sent me home.  I saw a cardiologist and he put me on Rythmol 225 2 x a day and Metoprolol er 50 mg 1 x a day. At first I was tired and had no energy.  After about 2 weeks I started to feel better with no other side effects.  My doctor suggested that I get the ablation so I could be free of any meds_ so I tried that. The procedure was not painful at all_ but the doctor couldn't get my heart to mess up at all_ so he ended the procedure. That was last September and I have had 2 small episodes of palpations since. My EP doctor said I might try to reduce my dosage to one a day_ but I'm afraid the palpations and arrythmia will come back.  Overall I think the Rythmol has helped me. I do everything I use to except drink coffee_tea_ and eat chocolate.I can live with that. They really need to lower the price for people that can't afford it.,,F,62,1  years225 2X D,2/8/2011,Rythmol

I am not real happy with my cardioligist as he just wants me to try the ""newest"" pill and my GP really doesn't understand the connection of my symptoms. I am fortunate to live in an area with many choices ofteaching institutions_ and recently found out about a world renowned EP cardioligist close by. I have talked to his successes with Pulmonary Vein Ablation and have an appointment in a week for a second opinion.

Had maybe 4 palapatations (4 or less beats) in the las 10 months. I think your hair grows slower_ but that just means less haircuts. No loss of ability to exercise.

36, 4, Cardiac Ablation,Originally took Multaq twice a day during my post-ablation recovery to control afibs until scar tissue formed.  It worked_ but only for a few hours - never reached 12 hours before next dose was due and this was frustrating.  Then the EP put me on Rythmol 325mg X 2 a day_ and it controlled my afibs for the full 12 hours each dose.  Now_ I am getting very small afibs again after a month post-ablation and they are getting more frequent in nature.  The EP told me to continue my cardio exercise_ but the Rythmol makes me yawn constantly as I am not pumping enough blood with oxygen with this slower heart rate.,I had an uncontrolled afib episode that finally sent me to the hospital.  It was finally controlled by an IV drug - Cardizam(?)_ but once off the drip_ the afib would return.  Had a cardiac ablation to remedy this afib.  It worked for a month_ now the afibs are back_ not as strong or long lasting_ but getting more frequent each day.

Had a cardioversion 8 months ago. My heart stayed steady for 7 months before the AFib returned. My cardiologist put me on Rythmol (225 mg twice a day). Before taking the drug the only effect I felt from the AFib was slight shortness of breath when I began exercising. After a couple of minutes of exercise the shortness of breath disappeared. I called the doctor's office today and was told to discontinue taking Rythmol and return to taking digoxin.

I wish I was one of those who didn't feel them.  I would pay at least $72 to not feel them anymore.  Thought about ablasion_ but the word actually means to destroy_ so I think I will think on it.

49, 2, AF,Who knows.  When you have afib you feel weak_ dizzy_ out of breath_ have palpitations and anxiety because your heart beats are irregular.  Had AF about 4-8 hours almost every day with some episodes lasting 18-24 hours.  The side effects of the drug were minimal compared to the effects of the AF.,"Had pulmonary vein catheter ablation 3 months ago.  Marked reduction in paroxymal AF immediately.  No AF after two weeks  Still taking the drug along with diltiazem.  Should be able to stop all the drugs in a couple of weeks.  Protocol calls for continuing the drugs and wsrfarin for 3 months post ablation.   All of these posts I read about drugs causing problems seem actually to be the AF causing problems.  Work with your Dr. and find a combination of drugs that relieves the AF.  If that doesn't work look into ablation.  The procedure is pretty successful (80%?) for lone paroxymal AF.  The longer you have AF the harder it is to get rid of.  Once it is chronic and you are ""older"" it is tough to get rid of the AF.  However I will be glad to get off the heart meds.

Increased my dosage to 425mg 2x day - still not holding me in regular rythmn.  Having a second ablation on Friday to fix the Atrial tachtychardia I have developed.  Rythmol makes me extremely tired.  I used to Jazzercise 3x wk_  plus Zumba - can't do either anymore! Very depressed_ anxious_ short of breath_ night sweats_ daily hot flashes and lethargic.  Dull headache everyday_ mildly constipated_ blurry vison... Hoping second ablation fixes all.  Had the ablation to get off all meds_ as promised.  Starting to lose hope of this!!!",F,49,4  months,11/23/2009Email,Rythmol
53, 4, acute A/F,metallic taste for several weeks,After four ablations to correct severe a/f_ and hidden flutter_ I am now free of symptoms_ HB stays at 65-70. Also take lisinopril to remould heart action. Seems to have been quite effective,M,64,8  years,10/23/2009Email,Rythmol
54, 2, A- Fib,I was always tired_ no energy_ food and liquids didn't taste right. I had a constant light flutter all the time. Would take 3 or 4 naps a day. Stomach hurt.short of breath just walking from one room to another. I was on 325 mg for 1 week when i said enough.,After 1 week of being off Rythmol 325 i am feeling much better_ still have irregular beats but it is better than being on the Rythmol,F,50,7  days,10/12/2009,Rythmol
55, 3, pvc's_ Ventricular tachycardia,I had an ablation that did not help at all so then I was put on Rythmol SR 225mg twice a day and it worked fine for about a year then had increase in pvc's so up dose to 325mg and that didn't make a difference so increased to 425mg twice a day and I am so extremely tired all the time_ I can barely function. I'm debating on trying another ablation even though I don't know if it will work_ I'm frustrated!,,F,38,17  months,10/9/2009,Rythmol
56, 1, A-Fib and A flutter,After my 3rd failed attempted to fix my A-fib the Dr. put me on Rythmol and I turned into a zombie monster. I could not even walk up the steps to go work in the morning_ then after taking it for appx. 2 weeks I started yelling and freaking out on everyone. I am thinking this is not the medication for me I have never felt this way before and I am tired of apologizing to my wife.,I actually scared myself by the way I was acting.,F,,2  weeks,8/26/2009Email,Rythmol
57, 2, Atrial Flutter/Fib,Increase in irregular heart beats. Non-stop atrial flutter_ diarrhea (only for the first two days)_ Milk and water tasted sour.,I was prescribed Rythmol for my Atrial Flutter. Though I had heard great things about this drug_ that is was specifically designed to help atrial flutters/fibrillations_ it just did not work me. I took the drug a few days before my cardioversion and a few days after. The first two doses (325 MG each_ twice/day) I noticed an increased in irregular heart rhythms. For the first time in eight months of having palpitations I've had an atrial flutter I could not break. Doc took me off Rythmol. I'm now looking into having an ablation surgery to stop the flutters.,M,36,7  days,7/7/2009,Rythmol
58, 5, Lone A-Fib,Some constipation.  Metallics taste initially which has dissipated.,"I have had lone a-fib since I was about 13 years old.  I was told I had mitral valve prolapse and my doctor thought that was the cause of my ""palpatations"".  Doctors could never catch me while in a-fib until this past year when I had an episode for 12 hrs.  The Cardiologist put me on Rythmol SR 325mg twice a day.  He then added Cardizem 150mg later in case I have another a-fib episode...it's suppposed to slow my heart rate.  I haven't had one a-fib episode since being on Rythmol.  I hope it lasts.  I'm looking into ablation but waiting for the procedure to be studied longer and have a better success rate for those with a-fib in the future.",F,39,5  months,7/5/2009,Rythmol
59, 4, severe arrythmia,Have trouble climbing even the slightest incline because legs get tired and I get out of breath.  Can walk indefinitely on the flat_ swim_ whatever.  Very strange.  I have clear arteries and do not have PAD.  Not sure if Rythmol is the cause of this problem or not.,I have severe a-fib and other arrythmias_ take 325 Rythmol twice a day.  After  having tried about four different medecines_ I have finally found one that works - at least for now.  Way too expensive_ tho.  It uses up my prescription limit in 6 mos.  I get anything else from Walmart.,F,70,6  months,7/4/2009,Rythmol
