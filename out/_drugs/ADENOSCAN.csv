0, 1, Thorough cardiac workup,It helped to know ahead of time to expect nasty happenings!!!  I am serious about that!  They use this for a chemical stress test.  Sometimes they don't want to put you on a treadmill_ and this drug helps the body react as if you were doing that anyway. It dilates the blood vessels (which give you an instant headache) and just creates a confusing frightening feeling.  I became nauseated_ and was completely grateful for having not eaten a think for what seemed like forever.  NPO from the moment I entered the ER.....12 hours earlier.,I understand WHY this drug is used.  I just did NOT enjoy the experience - not even close!!!,F,69,1  days,3/17/2009Email,Adenoscan
