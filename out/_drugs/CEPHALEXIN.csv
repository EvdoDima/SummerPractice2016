I couldn't breathe and my legs and hands went numb.  My boss called an ambulance and they rushed me to a nearby hospital.  The entire time I thought I was going to die.  It took me about 30-45 minutes to calm down.  They couldn't find out what was wrong with me after blood work and CT scans(I think it could've been a panic attack) but after that I still haven't felt right.  3rd Day: I tried to call my Dr. (although it was a weekend so it was a nurse on call) and I had to do the run around from them to the ER to the pharmacist_ back to the ER where I got the antibiotics from and they told me to keep taking the antibiotics because they doubted it was a reaction.4th day: I'm still really dizzy and tired.  My hearts still beating really hard (not fast at least) and on and off I feel the sensation of what I felt on day 2_ but I'm (hopefully) able to control it.Seriously_ if this isn't a reaction then why the hell am I feeling like this when this is the only thing I've been taking??

Back ache_  feeling of unreality_ anxiety and dread_ insomnia. I called Dr. and begged to be switched to a different antibiotic.,"The literature that came with the drug said to take this med ""with care"" if you are 65 or older.  As we age_ humans produce fewer of the enzymes that break down this and other meds and help to clear them from the system.  So we end up with super high concentrations of the drug in our blood.
