0, 4, Insomnia and anxiety,PRN for occasional anxious periods in life. Only used at night and in small quantities.It's OK for rare to occasional use_ but I did not find it effective as an insomnia treatment drug_ nor for daily use. The body can rapidly build up a tolerance for this_ meaning you need an increased dose after a few days or so. So_it is best used as a one-off_ once-in-a-blue moon medication.,Used at night only.In the morning_ I felt groggy_ cranky and grumpy.It is not a mood enhancer by any means and you can expect it to flatten and lower your mood significantly_ the next day.It does calm the muscles though. For instance_ if you grind your teeth in your sleep_ or move around a lot_ it can help you relax.Also_ you can expect to wake up_ from your own snoring/ snorting_ if you take this at night. It relaxes the throat_ so you tend to snore if you take this at bedtime.,F,39,10  years7-22.5mg 1X D,4/8/2014,Oxazepam
