0, 5, cirrhosis of the liver,none noticed,When I first found out I had cirrhosis my doctors were pretty sure I would need a transplant. They decided to up my dosage and since then the swelling went down and there has been no additional scarring on my liver. I should probably say that I am helping the cause of it remaining healthy because I do not drink nor have I even tasted alcohol.,F,19,4  years500 MG 2X D,4/18/2010,Actigall
1, 3, Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,Severe fatigue at 9 pills per day.,For a drug known for its lack of side effects_ be careful at higher doses.  I had been taking six per day for about six years and never realized how lethargic it was making me feel.  When the Dr. increased the dosage to nine per day_ I could barely function.  Without it_ my liver enzymes go off the chart_ so for now I take four per day which is tolerable.,M,36,6  years,8/8/2007Email,Actigall
