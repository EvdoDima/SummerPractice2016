0, 5, Unable to sleep nightmares anxiety,Blue face and hands. I have to go off it now. Its very noticeable as it reacts to sunlight exposure rare ad it is_ it has happened to me.,I've tried coming off a few times but nothing else works like it does for me..,F,59,10  years300mg qhs,7/27/2016Email,Desipramine hcl
1, 5, Migraines,Dry mouth and nightmares (but not too disturbing),Started at a very low dose and gradually increased to 100mg by the end of 4 months. It has significantly reduced the frequency and severity of my daughter's migraines.  She had previously tried topiramate and propranolol with horrible side effects. She tolerates the Desipramine very well and it works wonders. Much easier to tolerate than protriptyline_ which she also tried.,F,14,5  months100mg,2/20/2016,Desipramine hcl
2, 2, nerve pain in pelvic area,Slightly having issues with sleeping. Increasingly painful orgasms. The longer I am on this drug_ the worse the pain gets each orgasm.,,M,29,30  days25 1X D,4/20/2015Email,Desipramine hcl
3, 2, Fibromyalgia pain,Only took two days. Could not sleep_ dry mouth and nausea.,,F,75,2  days25mg,3/4/2015,Desipramine hcl
4, 1, Depression Panic Disorder,Practically no side effects at all_ just some mild tiredness at bedtime dose,This was like taking a placebo--nothing happened at all even as I increased the dose. Seems to affect norepinephrine more than serotonin. I read it may be better for people withdrawing from stimulants like cocaine.,M,50,40  days50 3X D,9/30/2014Email,Desipramine hcl
5, 5, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,,,M,57,21  years97 MG 1X D,11/28/2012EmailHistory,Desipramine hcl
6, 1, Major Depression with anhedonia,Dry mouth_ difficulty urinating_ somewhat decreased sex drive/anorgasmia_ constipation_ heptatoxicity.,"I took this medicine because of my anhedonic depression (apathy_ lack of drive_ inability to feel pleasure_ feeling ""empty_"" etc.). It felt like a sugar pill other than the side effects_ which I guess alerted me that the medicine was at least in my body. It wasn't good on my liver so I had to stop.",M,20,3  weeks100mg 2X D,9/16/2012,Desipramine hcl
7, 5, Depression & anxiety,Serious constipation_ dry mouth_ trouble sleeping_ weight gain,,F,40,2  years150,4/19/2012,Desipramine hcl
8, 2, dysthymia_ bulimia,trouble falling asleep and staying asleep_ binge eating/compulsive over-eating_ weight gain,This medication brought back my bulimia_ which was in remission for over a year. It caused me to have very strong urges to binge eat daily after being on it for a few weeks that I could not fight despite using all my therapeutic tools I could think of. Additionally_ I had previously been able to cope with episodes of overeating without purging since my recovery from my eating disorder_ though not while on this medication. It seemed to increase my impulsivity in that way_ which is counter to almost evertying else I've read about this medication. Also_ it didnt' do much for my depressive symptoms (if anything it made it worse because of how out of control I felt with the return of the bingeing and purging and fear of weight gain).,F,23,60  days100mg 2X D,6/28/2010,Desipramine hcl
9, 5, Depression,Dry mouth_ constipation_ lightheadness when I stand up suddenly_ itching_ sleep disturbances.,I was put on this medication as one of my last resorts after trying nearly every other anti-depressant on the market and having to discontinue them because I couldn't tolerate the side effects.  This medication has been wonderful.  I feel less depressed than I have in a decade and the most of the side effects either went away completely or were greatly reduced after a couple of weeks on the medicine.  My dosage was very slowly increased from 25mg to 75mg and now I feel great.  Hooray!!,F,42,2  months75mg 1X D,5/24/2010,Desipramine hcl
10, 2, Depression,Gained 30 pounds_ difficulty urinating_ dry mouth_ forgetfulness_ stammering_ constipation_ craving for sweets,This med gave me very little benefit and a LOT of crummy side effects.  I hope everybody else has a better experience with it!,F,45,6  months,1/14/2010,Desipramine hcl
11, 3, depression,weight gain_ occasional constipation,It was recommended in a trial of R-EEG to find what meds should work best for me.  It worked ok for a while at a high dose of 250 mg and now I'm at 350 mg and it's quit working.  worked ok for about 6 months but I've been through over 10 anti-depressants and nothing's worked for long.  I've gained 20 pounds since starting to take it.,F,61,10  months,10/27/2009,Desipramine hcl
12, 2, depression,acid reflux in the morning_ change in sleep cycle (couldn't stay asleep as long_ felt too cold or too hot_ some minor nausea,I started on the lowest possible dose of 10mg at night.  On the second day I couldn't stay asleep more than 4 hours.  After that I started taking it in the morning.  My sleep pattern was still altered.  Also_ immediately after I woke up I would have the worst acid reflux.  I gave up after 7 days.  I know its not enough time to judge a drug but my tolerance for these kind of side effects is really low.,M,55,7  days,5/10/2009,Desipramine hcl
13, 1, Panic disorder,Extreme worsening of panic attacks: more frequent and more intense.,Do not recommend taking this for panic attacks or anxiety.,F,22,10  days,1/17/2009,Desipramine hcl
14, 4, depression/anxiety,dry mouth_ heart palpitations_ increased sweating. -no weight gain,"Desipramine was the 1st anti-depressant that I took. It worked well for me. I went on it very slowly....probably taking about 6 months to get to my daily dose of 200mg (taking 100mg 2xday). I was so glad to be feeling ""happy"" that I did not care about the side effects. After going off it_ however_ when I became pregnant...then going back on_ it seemed to lose its effectiveness. I had to switch to a new med and am still trying to find one that I can live with and that works well.",F,39,7  years,8/25/2008,Desipramine hcl
15, 5, depression/ add/ panic disorder,dry mouth_ increased appetite,I am very pleased with this medication it replaced- wellbutrin and adderall- I pay cash for my rxs so this saves me about $80 per month.  It also seems to do better than my other medications!,F,33,45  days,5/5/2008,Desipramine hcl
16, 5, antidepression,Tried multiple drugs.  This one combined with zoloft helps without drowsiness.,,F,,3  months,7/17/2007,Desipramine hcl
17, 5, Morning depression,A short while after taking_ experienced brief heart flutter. Occasional constipation. Awakening after a few hours of sleep at night just once every night_ but can tolerate this_ considering the superlative help it has given me for morning depression.,A God-send! A life-saver! A tricyclic without the sedating effects the others have. Weaned myself down from 75 mg. daily to 25 mg. daily for years; upped dose to 50 mg. daily at bedtime to avoid flare-ups. An oldie but goodie! Superb drug!,M,64,26  years,1/10/2006,Desipramine hcl
18, 4, depression,There are few side efects for me.  One is waking up only after a few hours od sleep.  The other is weight gain. The weight gain has only been in the last 4 months.  I've gained 15 pounds.,,F,48,3  days,11/15/2005,Desipramine hcl

20, 5, Anxiety/Depression,Only side effects have been constipation and a slightly increased heart rate.,This drug was a God send.  It has completely cured me of my despression/anxiety. I feel normal again.,F,54,12  years,8/9/2004,Desipramine hcl
21, 5, Depression and Drug addiction,Dry mouth_ increased heart rate_ somewhat higher anxiety (but I am treated for anxiety already).  The one good side effect I had was an very high increase in my libedo! (husband is very happy)!  I do have some weight gain which is my only concern.  But when I figure I haven't attempted suicide since I have started this med_ the weight gain is the least of my problems.,,F,40,1  years,2/26/2004,Desipramine hcl
22, 5, depression,dry mouth and constipation were the worst but seemed so subside after the first two weeks.  Another strange side effects is my urine is very concentrated even though I drink between three and four liters of water a day.,,F,30,22  days,10/18/2002,Desipramine hcl
23, 2, Depression/ADD,No effect other than a rash over my arms and legs,,F,17,2  days,5/21/2002,Desipramine hcl
