0, 3, Anxiety_Panic attacks_ Agoraphobia,"Was prescribed this medication in late 1990's. My Psychiatrist increased the doseage every time I saw him.  At present I take one dose daily of 4 15mg tablets.  60 mgs of generic Tranxene every day is pretty expensive.  A pharmicist agreed to sell the 120 15mg tabs per month for $45.  My general physician now prescribes the meds as I no longer see a psychiatrist_ only a psychologist and general physician. The M.D. says if I quit taking the Chloraszepate I would have seizures.  I am obviously quite physically addicted to this medication.  I have no idea how I will get off of it.  In the beginning it helped tremendously.  I have been on Most ALL Benzodiazepines for anxiety.  I have been in psychotherapy for 26 years. First I was treated for depression in 1980 when I graduated high school.  Most people with depression have anxiety.  Unfortuantely I have been on MANY anti-anxiety meds and cannot find a ""safe"" med that doesn't have addiction problems.",I would like to get OFF of this medication!  I wish there was an alternative ...besides using alocohol which affects the same way.,F,44,8  years,11/28/2006Email,Clorazepate dipotassium
