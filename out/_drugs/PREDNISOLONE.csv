0, 5, Pneumonia,Little high blood pressure.,Fantastic wonder drug_ removed lungh infection in super speed.Don't get scared of all the bad reviews. In fact; most people tolerate it very well. I have to admit the reviews scared me.It took my asthma_ allergies_ migraine_ depression_ low sex-drive and stiff muscles away. The euphoric effect disappears after a few days_ in that time you feel so good_ happy and confident_ you may get a little hyperactive and do all the stuff you didn't want to do. I also noticed i felt a little warm and very horny the first few hours after taking it. No sleep problems or anything.If you want to avoid side effects_ or the hyperactivity_ space the dosing; for example 20mg and then 20mg 30-60 minutes later. DO NOT space it more_ because then you decrease its effectiveness.,M,29,7  days40 MG 1X D,4/25/2016,Prednisolone

2, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,On 15mg I thought I was going crazy. I was restless and couldn't sleep. Felt panicky. I reduced to 10mg and it was BLISS. No pain_ tons of energy_ body toned up_ was able to be really active. Slept fine. It was as thought this is what my body had missed all my life. I'm now on 7mg maintenance_ and am trying to alternate between that and 5mg daily. To reduce side effects and problems.

When nothing else works_ prednisone shuts off fever_ myositis_ RA.  Then the side effects come.,"After 3 weeks moon face.  Takes about 2 months for it to go away after you taper to below 7 mg/day.  Be patient. High dose_ can't sleep_ don't want to eat_ can't type (re-type 3 times) can be irritable (so don't be and help the folks around you cope with you) As you taper_ your appetite can become enormous_ expect it and stay away from all salt and sugar_ refined foods and anything ""white"" as it can induce diabetes.  Thank God for the drug even with the side-effects_ I am so glad it is there anyway.

6, 5, Bells Palsy,Muscle aches and twitches_ increased hunger_ fuzzy head and vision. Tiredness but this could have been the Bells Palsy anyway. I caught the paralysis of the face fast enough (within 48h) for the steroid drug to reduce the nerve swelling and restore motor function to almost 100% by day six of taking 50mg/day. Had some mild withdrawl symptoms for 4-5 days afterwards (was not tapered off as only on them for 10 days) - tired with slight muscle aches. Slight facial twitching and ear pain dying away after a week. Well worth putting up with.,Very effective in my case considering Bells Palsy can drag on for months or even years in some cases. Steroids if taken quickly after facial paralysis can increase your chances of making a full recovery.,M,47,10  days,9/16/2009,Prednisolone

8, 4, Crohn's Disease,weight gain (mainly in the face and belly) lemon shaped belly (it went all hard and rounded) increased facial and chest hair (no problem) more spotty (mostly face and legs) ridiculous appetite (enjoyable after not being able to eat though) obsessions with strange things. manic episodes (doing things way faster than was practical) feeling that if there was an accident or a fight that i could save/defeat anyone. no hair loss (thank christ),i got diagnosed 6 months ago but had had crohn's for 10 years previously. although it seems like i put a lot of side effects down it wasnt so bad. they made me feel energetic and quite strong generally_ made me poo regularly (up to 7 times solid a day_ but when i got used to them just twice normally) it was good to poo regularly and solid too. and not be in pain. or worry about going out and having to go to the toilet. i was not happy about the weight gain though. weening off now and getting more pain. although my belly is smaller (horay) i'd still rather not have pain.,M,25,150  days,12/10/2007,Prednisolone
9, 4, SLE,Moon face_ insomnia_ depressed mood_ thinning of the skin_ slow wound healing_ irregular menstrual period_ increased growth of facial hair_ weight gain_ increased appetite.       ,I was in high dosage of prednisolone when I was first diagnosed with SLE. I was extremely unhappy due to the change of my appearence-round bloated face and lot of weight gain_ but it did keep my lupus under control. The doctors were not sure if it was SLE or steroid that caused my joint problems--I have a total hip replacement and core decompression done on both shoulders. I have osteopenia due to long term use of this drug and is taking actonel. There is good evidence that Calcium and vitamin D supplements protect against osteoporosis brought on by corticosteroids. So talk to your doctor about taking these supplements if you will be on this drug on a long term basis. I wish that my doctor knew about this before he put me on this drug.,F,49,30  years,10/29/2006,Prednisolone
