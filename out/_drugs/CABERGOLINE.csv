1, 3, Prolactinoma,fatigue_ dizziness_ crazy emotions_ depression_ anxiety_ weight gain_ loosing hair off my head and gaining it on my chest and face_ brain fog and a total lack of motivation.,"I was diagnosed with Prolactinoma(2cm_ 1500 prolactin levels) after I didn't have a cycle for 2 years and I started getting extreme migraines daily.  I was put on Dostinex_ the daily migraines decreased in intensity and duration_ but still no cycle to this day (8 years on Cabergoline)  My prolactin numbers have reached  ""normal range""_ currently at 58.  Lately I have been feeling depressed_ anxious and very angry.  I have also been getting hair growth on my face and chest and am just explode with anger when I am normally a pretty laid back gal. I can see that I am acting aggressive and crazy_ but I can't seem to stop the reaction.  I got my testosterone checked and it is high_ 68.  I feel that the medication is increasing my testosterone_ which is causing my anger_ but my prolactin is still high and when I tried to get off the meds a few months ago because of the anger my prolactin jumped up to 175 in just 6 weeks.  I am frustrated that I don't have options.  I feel that the Cabergoline is causing: Increased testosterone_ anger_ anxiety_ emotional melt downs (anger and crying)_ I could easily sleep 12 hours a day and need coffee everyday_ and my weight is climbing even though I am too depressed to eat much. The positives is that the headaches are less intense and the tumor is not growing.   The negatives are that I am an emotional mess_ I am slowly turning into a man and I don't have any motivation to do the things I once loved (mountain biking_ backpacking_ running",F,30,8  years.5 mg 3X W,11/3/2011Email,Cabergoline
