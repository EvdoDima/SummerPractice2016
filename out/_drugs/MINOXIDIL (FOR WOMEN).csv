1, 1, ,Dandruff_ heart palpatations,Here is the thing with this medication - it absolutely DID work for me - it grew my hair and thickened it up.  The reason I gave it a 1 (dissatisfied) is this:  I truly believe that minoxidil has contributed to me getting rosacea.  If you don't know what this is_ please look it up as there's not enough room to explain.  As rogaine (minoxidil) is a vasodilator - it expands blood vessels - I truly believe this is what happened to me.  Yes_ rosacea can be hereditary and yes_ I believe that too may be a factor.  But_ you can also get rosacea from damaged blood vessels.  By putting minoxidil on my head for many many years (and expanding my blood vessels) - I believe this could be a possibility...  I wish I would not have done this to myself...  Rosacea is painful and incurable.....,F,54,9  years 2X D,6/12/2012,Minoxidil (for women)
2, 1, Thinning hair,I suffered horrible feelings of paralysis like a numbness in my face and sometimes teeth. I felt like my head was going to fall of my neck. Also experienced breathlessness and night sweats.,"For ears I and my doctors couldn't figure out what my ""mysterious illness"" was.  The doctors forgot to ask me if I was taking minoxidil before they prescribed medication.  As a result_ I had severe drug reactions with other meds. Then later when I stopped the meds & was just taking minoxidil_ I still felt sick.  I accidentally read the side effects of minoxidil and realized the numbness was what I was suffering. When I completely stopped_ I got better.  Stay away from this drug it doesn't work that well and the few hairs you do get are not worth your health!",F,45,2  years,7/23/2009,Minoxidil (for women)
