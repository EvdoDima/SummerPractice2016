4, 2, plantar faciitis; aches & pains,Very drowsy and tired and no pain relief at all.,Unlike previously taking just one tablet of Aleve_ which immediately took away my pain symptoms_ this drug had absolutely no effect at all. My doctor prescribed this drug (instead of Aleve)_ to be taken twice daily_ but after reading the side effects_ I am concerned about that frequency. I'll not bother with it anymore and will occasionally take Aleve instead. Fortunately my pharmacy made an error in only giving me 6 tablets instead of 60. I'm glad it happened; it saved me an unnecessary expense.,F,65,1  days75 mg 2X D,7/11/2010,Diclofenac sodium
