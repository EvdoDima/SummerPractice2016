0, 2, Gerd/Acid reflux,I have taken this before maybe once a year or every couple years for a while. Never had any side effects. Found it helped me a lot to be honest with no side effects. But this time my dr had me taking it for 3 months to clear a ulcer I did not have. Even tho it helped with heartburn it had the wildest side effects like dizziness_ loss of words for brief moments while talking to people_ anxiety and the biggest was severe leg cramps and muscle weakness. Did some research into it and sounded like there was a lot of people experiencing the same things. Been a week off it now and most side effects are gone. I do not know if I could recommend this product again due to all the new warnings that have recently came out about this drug.,,M,35,1  months20mg,5/27/2016Email,Prilosec otc
1, 1, One night acid indigestion,Severe heart palpitations for 45 days straight_ day and night. Spiking blood pressure (200/105)_ where I am usually 110/70. Severe neck stiffness_ and very sick burning feeling in the muscles_  where you can not turn head. Insomnia. High anxiety.,This drug has side effects that are dangerous. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. The problem with the drug is_ it is 95% protein bound to plasma proteins and proton pump proteins. When Prilosec OTC enters the acid environment in the stomach_ it turns into a different compound which irreversibly binds to proteins. It no longer gets excreted at the same rate as the initial drug. This is why it takes so long for the effects to go away. There is absolutely no literature saying how long until it is completely metabolized out of the body. At about 45 days_ I had tiny relief and saw there might be hope to feel better. I did take a BP medication to temporarily lower the BP and am planning to go off it soon. The theory behind the raise in BP is: proton pump inhibitors block an enzyme that lowers another enzyme that effects nitric oxide to be produced which dilates blood vessels. So_ basically the nitric oxide one needs to dilate vessels and keep BP down_ is not getting to your arteries. Because Prilosec OTC (and all other PPI's) take so long to leave the body_ the side effects last endlessly. I think one has to take care of the side effects while they are present until that second deadly compound leaves your body (when the proteins are degraded) which takes long. One person on this site_ wrote that at 60 days post Prilosec_ she started to feel better. I have been about 8 weeks post Prilosec_ and see some hope. This has been the worst thing I have ever experienced due to the irreversibility of th,F,54,3  weeks20mg,12/13/2015Email,Prilosec otc

13, 1, Bleeding ulcer_ inflamed esophogus,"Began to have upper right abdominal pain_ after taking a dosage_ nothing would ease it.  It was my gallbladder_ Prilosec OTC caused me to have gallbladder attacks.  As soon as I stopped taking it those symptoms completely disappeared.  It also seemed to make my heartburn worse after a while_ stomach more acidic.  I have since learned quite by accident that I have a large gallstone and some enlargement of the bile duct. But have never had any symptoms of gallbladder trouble except mildly increased liver enzymes on bloodwork.  I have read some posts on this site that indicated they had found that Prilosec could cause issues that can further develop into stomach cancer and several posters said they had gallbladder issues arise because of it!!  Just another drug they all want to push as a ""wonder"" drug!

14, 1, Acid reflux/heartburn/gastritis,I was on this stuff for years and just in the last few years switched to Protonix.  I thought it was helping well for keeping my acid reflux at bay_ but in reality it was causing me to have more stomach pain & bloating and I just found out I have several (30) gastric polyps now and they were most likey caused from long term use of PPI's.  I'm mad because not one doctor_ in all these years_ ever warned me that long term use could cause polyps_ not to mention weak bones and teeth_ and also cause a rebound effect trying to get off of them. I have slowly weened myself off_ but now have to deal with heartburn/reflux every day.,My advice is to stay off this drug at all costs_ do natural stuff instead_ like aloe vera juice/gel_ apple cider vinegar_ or whatever else you can find instead.,F,50, 20 MG 1X D,2/1/2012Email,Prilosec otc
15, 3, Acid reflux/gastritis,After going off the antibiotic Cipro_ I was told to take Prilosec OTC once a day. The first day_ I had extreme thirst_ the second day_ my heart beat like it was going out of my body_ the third day there was some unrealistic extreme anxiety and headache_ the third day - just felt very very very very fatigued. The fourth day was very fatigue and had intense pain in my upper left abdomen. Have not been able to sleep correctly - go to bed fine but waking up way too early. Extreme dry mouth and metallic taste in mouth and funny smell (metallic) in urine. Fifth day_ extreme anxiety. Woke up the 6th day (today) and decided not to take it. Has effected my work and thinking.,I know these ratings are always questionable_ because you don't know if this is the medicine or the disease_ and being that I had a UTI_ I just can't 100 percent say_ but all I know is that before this and before taking medicine_ I was sleeping (even with my fluttering and all that was going on which caused all to think it was GAS and reflux) better. It appears to have cleared up most of the issue. Prevacid did this to me too(took it two days) and Zantac didn't work either. Maybe it was too much a dose for me_ don't know.,F,41,5  days20 1X D,11/15/2011Email,Prilosec otc

18, 3, irritation_ duodenum,Worked well for me_ but pain came back when I stopped taking it.,Prilosec has a rebound effect.  When I stopped taking it_ the stomach acid came back in full force.  So I most recently started cutting the pills in half_ making it 10mg.  They dont sell these otc_ you have to get a doctors prescription.  For me_ cutting the pills works well.  I then start alternating the Prilosec OTC 10mg one night_ with Zantac 75 the next night. I continue reducing the dosage of Prilosec and increasing the Zantac until off.  I now use the Prilosec on an as-needed basis_ and depend more on the Zantac.   Too bad they don't provide more info on the rebound and other side effects of Prilosec.,F,68, 20 mg 1X D,5/28/2011Email,Prilosec otc

20, 1, gerd,,this is just a note to those trying to come off this drug without rebounding.  ASK YOUR DR FOR THE 10MG version... they DO make it!  you can't cut the 20 pill in half!  so alternate a 20mg with a 10mg for like 2 weeks_ then cut down to the 10 version.  start taking the 10 every other day then ween down to zantac 150.. then zantac 75 to avoid any rebound.  this should work!,F,26,1  years20 1X D,3/3/2011,Prilosec otc
21, 2, Dyspepsia (indigestion)_ GERD,Rebound reflux after stopping,Prilosec helped with my symptoms of burping/indigestion that the doctors diagnosed as GERD. After an upper GI endoscopy and other tests revealed no illness and no esophogeal damage_ I decided to stop taking Prilosec. I'd read that it's best to taper the dose slowly. But when I cut the dose to 20mg I experienced terrible heartburn for about 2 weeks - and I'd never really had any heartburn before. My GI doc and internist both said I should go back on the 40 mg does and stay on it basically forever. Instead_ I took one 20 mg tablet for two weeks_ then cut back to every other day for two weeks_ then stopped (and took a lot of Tums instead). Now_ after nearly 8 weeks_ I'm starting to feel nearly back to normal. So_if you find you have terrible heartburn after quitting_ and you want to get off the meds_ I recommend that you taper and stick with it for at least 2-3 months. Otherwise_ you'll be taking the stuff forever.,F,48,4  months40 MG 1X D,2/21/2011,Prilosec otc

I actually had a pretty good day yesterday.  I have also changed my eating habits (eating smaller portions more often and chewing my food thoroughly) if I do start getting heartburn I control it with TUMS.  I am still having some muscle pain and my pulse rate goes up from time to time for no apparent reason.  Still feeling fatigued.  The best part is that I don't feel like I'm going out of my mind or that I'm going to die at any moment.  I can't say for sure that the drug was causing these symptoms_ but since stopping it_ I sure feel a lot better.  I'll update again in a few days.,M,42,2  months20 1X D,6/26/2010,Prilosec otc
