1, 4, Pain and fever,No side effects. Gets rid of fever_ doesn't do anything for pain for me though. I am not sure why. It doesn't relieve swelling for me either. Works great for fevers though_ brings them down really fast.,,F,,1  days200 1X D,7/3/2016Email,Tylenol
2, 3, Shoulder pain,None,all I am allowed to take since I had wls and can't take Motrin due to ulcer risk. Well I pulled my shoulder and the only thing that would work is good old fashioned naproxen can't take it. Calling doctor tomorrow,F,29,1  days1000 mg,3/24/2015,Tylenol
3, 3, It's in the Vicodin my Dr. gave me.,After taking Vicodin for three years_ it and any product containing Tylenol/acetaminophen now gives me a perfect 10 migraine which only ibuprofen will make go away. Before this happened it used to be the best pain reliever for me.,My Dr. had to switch me to ms contin due to my reaction now.Short term duration of this medication is the ONLY way it should be taken in my opinion.,M,51,3  years325 3X D,11/23/2012,Tylenol
4, 3, Shoulder Pain,I received a headache about 30mins after taking.Also a very weak tingle in my arms_ like they were falling asleep.I still have shoulder pain =/,I think I will stick to  ibuprofen when it comes to needing a pain med.Since I have never had a problem with that medication.I also notice when taking Tylenol I end up having to take more then I want to take. With ibuprofen I take 2-4pills instead of 6-8 of Tylenol. =(,F,27,1  days6pills@500 1X D,8/17/2012Email,Tylenol
5, 1, headache,Paranoia,Anandamide reuptake inhibitor`?? Terrible addictive and gateway to hell. Maybe.,M,30,2  days1 1X D,1/2/2012,Tylenol
6, 3, Headaches.,None.,Tylenol is good for a headache. One pill never does anything_ two eases the pain_ but it's never 100%. To get rid of the pain completely (for severe pain) I take ibuprofen.,F,19,14  years,11/28/2009,Tylenol
7, 2, Headaches,None,Either im immune to this or it isn't very effective. I've taken it many times and always have to take more than recommended for anything to happen. It also takes a long time to kick in. Waste.,F,19,4  years,8/23/2009,Tylenol
8, 1, Pain,None,Seems to be more of a mental drug_ where it won't relieve pain but make you think it is working. If you are in pain_ try something else.,M,19, ,8/16/2009,Tylenol
9, 3, Headache.,It helped my headache but it too forever to kick in. I only got mild releif. I didn't expereience many side effects from this drug.,Good mild pain killer.,M,18,2  days,4/19/2009,Tylenol
10, 3, arthritis,I get mild headaches and feel sleepy. I also feel lethargic.None of these side effects is listed anywhere_ but I have been experiencing them repeatedly.,It helps somewhat with my arthritis pain. Aleve worked really well for me_ but I cannot take it (and other NSAIDs) because of stomach problems and other side effects_ so I am glad I can take Tylenol sometimes. But if I don't want to fall asleep_ I just put up with the pain until it bothers me too much ... There don't seem to be any good choices for me.,F,57,3  years,2/26/2009,Tylenol
11, 2, Pain (post-op),Taking Tylenol elevates my blood pressure significantly.  I have experienced this numerous times.  Most recently hospital personnel tended not to believe me and administered Tylenol for pain after my aortic valve replacement.  They became believers!,I know Tylenol works very effectively for most people.  Unfortunately I and I am sure others have suffered significant side effects which seem to be met with doubt and denial  by well meaning health care professionals. My side effect is significantly elevated blood pressure.,M,63,1  days,12/13/2008Email,Tylenol
12, 1, headache or pain,When this drug wears off_ I am always very depressed.  I cannot take it.  Switched to ibuprofen with no problems.,Kind of scarey that this drug guarantees depression in me when it wears off!,F,46,10  times,11/30/2008,Tylenol
13, 4, Absessed Tooth,None,I have taken tylenol over the years for recurring headaches. Now I am taking 500 tylenol and 600 motrin for absessed tooth. Works great until bedtime. At bedtime I take 2 tylenol pms with motrin and if I take it early enough I actually get some sleep,F,29,5  years,8/25/2008,Tylenol
14, 4, Myalgias,None,,F,40,40  years,8/13/2008,Tylenol
15, 1, headache,None,Pain did not go away at all. Tylenol has never worked for me and I have tried it many times over the years when ibuprofen was not available.  Aspirin does not work either and medications that are pain relievers that have aspirin or acetaminophen (Excedrin) in them do not work. Opiates that contain either of these analgesics have limited efficacy for me as well; I usually have to double the dosage to receive any relief.,F,35, ,6/7/2008,Tylenol
16, 1, pain_ headaches,Itching_ like bugs crawling under my shin.,I've tried Tylenol over the years off and on_ usually when I can't take anything else; however_ Tylenol has never had any beneficial effect on aleving my pain.  The last 2 times I used it_ I ended up with an allergic reaction ~ severe itching all over my body (no hives_ just itching) that lasted for about 6 hours.,F,42, ,4/12/2008,Tylenol

18, 3, headaches,After taking tylenol regularly for 30 years I have developed a severe case of both diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis. My diet never included the foods normally associated with the cause of theses conditions_ and I hardly ever drink and have always led a clean_ healthy life style.,,F,,30  years,10/11/2007,Tylenol
19, 2, headache and shoulder pain,,Tylenol has never helped me with pain issues.  Regular aspirin works wonders for me. However_ never take too often. Always check with the pharmacist for any drug reactions.,F,60,55  years,10/9/2007,Tylenol
20, 4, dental pain and arthritis,headache_ including pounding in head_ throbbing of neck and temporal blood vessel (left side) and sometimes rapid heartbeat and/or palpitations_ all these occuring only as the drug wears out of my system.,If I absolutely must take an over the counter analgesic_ this is the one I reach for. It is especially effective on dental pain_ and causes fewer side effects than NSAIDS. However_ it sometimes gives me a headache as it wears off_ and symptoms that suggest it may be raising my blood pressure_ so I only take it when abosolutely necessary. In addition_ it is supposed to be hard on the kidneys_ although I have no information that it has negatively affected me in that way.,F,55,5  years,6/2/2007,Tylenol
21, 4, ,rarely_ nausea,,M,60, ,4/11/2007,Tylenol

23, 5, hadeache,n/a,works for me,F,40,100  weeks,7/17/2006,Tylenol
24, 4, fever,severe farting_ but worked great otherwise,,F,25,53  months,7/17/2006,Tylenol
25, 5, fever,None,Worked like a charm!  In fact_ every 4 hours when it started to wear off I could tell.  Too bad the package recommends you taking it only every 6 hours.  That seemed just long enough where my fever would start to return.  But after I took my dose the fever dropped like a rock.  Amazing medicine and so benign.  Oh_ I don't really drink but if you do_ quit while you take this.  The combo is a big no-no.,M,31,20  times,4/13/2006Email,Tylenol
26, 3, Arthritis in knees,Severe itching of legs,,F,59,10  years,1/25/2006,Tylenol
27, 1, post-surgery pain,After taking Extra Strength Tylenol for about 4 days I had extreme dizzyness_ the feeling of extreme hypertension (I already take meds for high blood pressure_ so I know what hypertension feels like)_ and a clammy_ sweaty/warm feeling.,I took just slightly less than the maximum dose.  I cannot completely verify that the Tylenol caused my problems_ but my physician recommended that I immediately stop taking it.  I felt better within two days after ceasing to use Tylenol.,F,42,4  days,9/10/2005,Tylenol
28, 1, Headache,Racing heart_ worse headache.,I even took no asprin tylenol and had problems breathing shortly after taking it. I will stick with advil and works better for me.,F,32,1  days,9/6/2005,Tylenol
