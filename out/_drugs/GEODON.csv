0, 1, Panic Disorder / Anxiety,"This drug made me insanely sedated. I took it once a day at night for three days_ on the fourth day I took it also in the morning and I could have fallen asleep standing up. Same for the next two days. I stopped taking it during the day because I fell asleep at my desk. It wasn't something caffeine could fix either. My heart would be POUNDING and I'd be jittery but could literally close my eyes for 2 seconds and be asleep. Cannot live like that. I started taking my dosage in the middle of the night (1 am) so that I could sleep off the drowsiness (it only really effected me for the first 3-5 hours after taking it)_ but after I upped my dosage I started getting tense jaw_ teeth grinding and shaking. I was also getting involuntary muscle movements and did my research about tardive dystonia/dyskinesia and promptly decided to get off it. I do NOT reccomend this drug... it makes you feel very ""drugged"" and you can tell when 12 hours between doses is up because you start feeling w",Controlled anxiety_ terrible side effects.,F,28,10  days20 2X D,7/28/2016,Geodon

3, 1, bipolar depression,This is the worst medication I have ever taken. Took me four miserable years to figure out that this was of my gut wrenting depression. For the first year it was fine. Then I became paranoid_ convinced everyone hated me_ lost all my friends. Then the dystonia started (when your muscles are tight and you can't control them) it was in my left leg right arm and face. I had no good emotions_ no matter what. I found it so hard to smile_ not to mention the anxiety of the charts_ I was almost agrophobic. . And I was so lazy and enjoyed nothing. Not to mention I gained 100 lbs. But wait_ it gets worse... I am currently tapering off this medication onto abilify and it is pure hell. I can't breath_ I can't focus_ I can't sleep. My Dr had to put me on benzetropines_  that's now another addiction battle I'm going to have to fight.,I swear_ dress are paid to push this drug. There is no other way that a drug with this many side effects and down falls would be prescribed @ such doses to completely unsuspecting people who are just looking for help.

4, 1, Bipolar Depression,Shortly after start_ had episode of forgetting how to drive (middle of traffic on interstate)_ felt like I was coming out of skin_ couldn't sit still_ jumping from one side of sofa to other_ couldn't walk_ shaky. Unfocused. At. most times_ walked slowly with shoulders hunched and mouth hanging open. Lost memory,This drug took my life. I've been off of it for a year_ now. The sad thing is_ my side effects remain! Constant right hand tremor. I WAS an artist_ with beautiful handwriting. No more. Still have severe memory loss. Still experience feeling of needing to get out of my skin. Severe anxiety. Mild OCD. Can't stand clothing to touch me_ at times. Extremely debilitating depression. That's just a glimpse. Mental issues...due to past use_ or just my own??? The memory loss and tremor_ I can say_ all Geodon. For seven years I took it_ faithfully_ to stop crying. Well_ I didn't cry for 7 years! Not even when my only_ baby sister died unexpectedly! Not when others I loved died. Not when terrible things happened to my kids. Many times_ I had NO idea of what was going on in my own home! Not only did it stop my crying_ but it took away laughter. Any ability to live was lost. Mostly_ I isolated_ and still do. I have 5 kids. Most of their events_ I missed. I can never get years back! The tears have returned_ but the joy is elusive. I can't imagine choosing to take Geodon_ knowing what I do now! If I were not God's child_ saved thru the blood of Jesus Christ_ I'd have strongly considered suicide. It's THAT BAD! One good thing is_ my withdrawal. I was taking 3 capsules a day. Weaned myself. First_ a week or two of 2 a day_ then_ down to one. It wasn't at all difficult for me to stop that insanity! I only wish that the changes it made in me were not permanent.

This really upset me because my doctor knows how much my weight gain concerns me; so what does he do?!  He prescribes Geodon which clearly has weight gain as a side effect.  I'm quite peeved with him right now.,Be your own advocate.  Do your homework on any meds prescribed.  My mistake was that I trusted my doc too much.

It's not like normal anxiety it's like a panic attack is trapped inside my head trying to push its way out and it is literally driving me crazy. My breathing is calm and my heart rate is normal when it starts. It usually starts around 5pm. I'm taking kilonipin but that only takes the edge off of it.

This is my first night without it and I feel almost normal again. I stopped cold turkey and I'm a little afraid there will be withdrawals but I'm willing to risk it so that I can stop feeling as down right terrible as I did while taking this.

11, 4, Bipolar ll,30 pound weight gain.,I'm sorry to read the severe side effects others are having. I take geodon for racing thoughts and irritability. The geodon has taken these issues away completely. I actually handle high stress situations much better than I thought possible. I switched to geodon in hopes of reversing the weight I gained from seroquel and saphris.Unfortunately if a med. has weight gain as a side effect I apparently am going to just gain weight. My pdoc suggested tegretol might help reverse the weight gain but I have read scary reviews about that med too.I take 150mg of lamotrigine daily as my mood stabilizer and it has been great for my depression. I've taken this for 10 years with no side effects.,F,47,2  years40mg x2 da,1/2/2016,Geodon
12, 1, Bipolar,Nose bleeds_ Migrains_ weight gain_ anxiety_ oversleeping_ tiredness_ memory loss still trying to figure out the damage...,I was put on geodon at age 9 to treat my bipolar. It was paired with lexapro to treat depression. I am now almost twenty and have taken myself off of both medications. I started taking myself off as soon as I turned eighteen.  Since being off I sleep better. I feel more alert and aware of my surroundings. I was forced into taking this medication. When I stopped I felt as though I woke up.. I have no anger or depression. I do however have mild anxiety attacks. This medicine has made my life extremely difficult. before my diagnoses i was diagnosed with several other disorders (Asperger's_ adhd_ schizophrenia )and was put on various other medications from a young age. I was bullied and grew up in an abusive household. The other medications made me do really strange things. I was taking geodon before I slept at night. if i was out of it or I forgot it I would have extreme withdraws. I am now concerned about my organs and my heart after being on this medicine for so long. It was unnecessary and did nothing but hurt me in the long run. I beg any one reading this to never put any one under the age of eighteen on this medication. It is too strong and causes to many horrible side effects that can and will do permanent damage. I have never felt better then I do now being off of this stuff. I am not saying your kid doesn't have a disorder or will be mis diagnosed like I did; however the brain is not fully developed at that age. being mis diagnosed is a real possibility.

13, 2, Mood Disorder_ Psychotic Episodes,Irritability_ rage_ loss of motivation_ headache_ nausea_ vomiting_ dry mouth_ Dysphagia (had trouble swallowing at times),I'm writing this on behalf of my boyfriend. He was first on rispiridone which did wonders for him but he was bothered by the facial drooping and slurring of speech so his doctor put him on this crap. It helps him a bit but he becomes extremely irritable and sometimes rageful and will pick fights for no reason. He gets sick a lot on this medication and gets headaches and dry mouth. This causes him to miss school and he's already missed a lot this year. He also has panic attacks where he has trouble swallowing and that Dysphagia side effect made it worse. The only reason I'm giving it a 2 is because it helped his psychotic episodes a bit. It did NOTHING for his mood_ in fact it made it worse. I was hoping this would help him put on some weight like the rispiridone did since he's a bit underweight but it's just made him sick. He stopped taking it and had withdrawal side effects from it too. A very poor choice for medication.,M,18,2  months 1X D,12/29/2015,Geodon
14, 4, Anxiety with Aspergers,"Greatly_ massively depleted ""will-power"" to accomplish even desired activities.",My son was diagnosed with Aspergers and Generalized Anxiety at 6.  By 9_ his outbursts led us to Geodon. It helped_ but left difficulties the psych blamed on anxiety...  He needed help to get to school_ a party_ a movie_ brush teeth_ tie shoes_ do homework. etc.  This went on 6 years.  He is now 15 and has been in 11 schools - private_ home_ co-op_ and public. He was banned from some; we left others. His ?anxieties? controlled our family life.Then_ 7 months ago_ we stopped Geodon. Amazingly_ our child came to life: eating new foods_ laughing_ becoming more animated_ taking new initiatives_ and never doing worse than with Geodon. His WILL returned and was now stronger than his ?anxiety.? We withdrew from the private school for children with learning disabilities and re-enrolled in the public school that had started truancy proceedings 11?2 years earlier.Now_ halfway through the school year_ he gets himself up and dressed_ has never been late_ has changed all of his classes to advanced placement_ controls his frustrations_ and his dull_ uninvolved look is gone. He is animated and expressive making real friends.SUMMARY: Geodon was a lifesaver when our child was young. But as he matured_ the medicine continued to suppress his ?will.? His psychiatrists never connected his school and life troubles with the medicine. We should have stopped Geodon earlier.

23, 5, depression and motivation issues,The first time I took Geodon I had this weird side effect. About 20min after taking it I felt suddenly severely depressed and suicidal. I started crying for no reason then laughing. My heart was beating really fast and it got worse to the point where I called 911 because it was pounding so hard I thought I might die. Everything turned out fine and I didn't end up going to the hospital but I stooped taking it for this reason to later on trying it out again.  If I hey overly excited/scared my heart will beat to fast and sometimed I get heart palpitations but I think I've got it under control now To where it's not a major problem anymore but a side effect that had gotten better over time.I also have 0 appetite. I had to lower my dose to 40mg because I couldn't physically eat. I was gagging on anything I tried eating even something small. I went back up to 60mg recently and it's been better but I am never hungry. I continue to lose weight which is nice but I'll have to watch out if I get too low.Another reason I don't eat much is because it make a me feel nauseas. My stomach seems weaker and can't handle much of anything besides water. I feel mild nausea after eating a bowl of soup and a piece of bread.,Keep a close eye out when you first start taking Geodon or when you increase it. Everyone I increase the dose I get a severe side effect. Sometimes you have to stay at a lower dosee for your body to get use to it so don't rush with it. I had severe anxiety/feeling like I was jumping out of my skin when I increased my dose. Don't let a bad side effect stop you from taking it if it's helping. Talk with your doctor about it. Also I feel dehydrated a lot so make sure your drinking enough water.,F,23,2  months60mg,4/24/2015,Geodon

25, 1, Mood disorder/ depression,-UNIMAGINABLE FATIGUE-low blood pressure-fainting -restlessness-dizziness/ disorientation,PLEASE DONT SKIP! My Dr. Put me on this on top of other meds to help with hopeless thoughts. I took 40mg at night and about 30-40 seconds when I woke up the following morning I felt extreme shaking and restlessness. I had to get up to go to school and the second I got up I was really dizzy and disoriented. I went to use the bathroom and I knew something was wrong because I could see black spots and felt like I was losing control of my body. I tried to call for help and tried to lift myself up with a towel hanger but it broke just as I was BLACKING OUT and hit my head on some marble. My dad is a Dr. and said the medicine can cause a SIGNIFICANT drop in blood pressure for some people. By the time I was able to lay down again I physically/verbally could not communicate or move. Another red sign was knowing that my eyes WOULD NOT STAY OPEN no matter all my will power I gave to get up due to the fatigue. I couldn't go to class I woke up in the late afternoon. I am a light sleeper and this put me out DEAD COLD even though I took it the night before. This pill will knock the hell out of you and I'm in college I can take tired this was NOT THAT. This level of exhaustion can only be felt because of something like this and I hope no one has to feel what I felt! PLEASE consider another form of medication before trying this!

26, 1, Bipolar Disorder,I was suicidal and severely depressed. Was started of Risperdal and Trazadone. Risperdal has so many law suits it's crazy. I stopped that drug. Was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on Geodon. Best thing I ever had for 3 weeks. I was extremely functional and able to experience joy again after months of darkness and depression. Then I missed a dose. The very next day I was suicidal again. I was depressed all over again. I stayed off for a few days before starting it again. I needed a fix. I started again and things got a little better but not much. I would still have manic phases and urges. This past Wednesday I missed a dose. I also missed Thirsdays dose. Friday I started getting strange sharp pains atop my head followed by dizziness and and elevated heart rate. I was hauled off in an ambulance with a blood pressure of 198/113. I thought I was dying. I had 5 panic attacks this past weekend and visited the hospital 5 times. Finally having a CT scan that was clear. I was also placed on BP meds. It's Monday and I'm plagued with a feeling of water running in my head. I feel itching in my head and forehead. Also burning. All accompanied by headaches. I'm tAking Ativan to help me calm down.

I also have my appetite back which I know I need to be careful about.

41, 1, PTSD_ Major Depressive Disorder,"I am 50 years-old. When I was 46 years-old_ Geodon caused major anxiety beyond anything ever experienced.

It almost killed me. The doctor told me she never heard of those side effects so she increased the dose! Unable to think_ I took it.  When anxiety became so bad_ curled up on the floor_ I stopped taking it. My two dachshunds (7 year-old twins) had to be re-homed. I couldn't care for them.

46, 1, Bipolar 2 Depression,,I was given Geodon as a Hail Mary when nothing else worked to relieve my bipolar depression. Zyprexa does work well but it caused metabolic syndrome and I had to discontinue its use over 2 years ago. I do take 750 mg. Of Depakote and 100 mg of Zoloft for basic maintenance. The first day after my first dose of taking Geodon I was driving home from a baby shower and felt like my eyes were finally open again - the world was beautiful and I loved my life! I felt expansive and so positive and decided to pop into a piercing parlour to get my nose pierce! Anyway that was the start of 5 weeks of intense mania -- spent money I didn't have_ argumentative_ decided to feng shei my whole house_ couldn't sleep_ talked incessantly_ sounded like jets flying through my head and I started lying and being sneaky. I just thought I finally had come out of my depression....unfortunately my driven behaviour felt so agitated and uncomfortable and my family became concerned. I was honest with the psych doc but he didn't associate the mania with Geodon and instead cut back my zoloft to 50 mg. And wanted to decrease depakote. Well I continued to spin into mania - having 4-5 lists going no at one time and so much to do! He took me off Geodon 3 nights ago and immediately the mania was gone (along with a few thousands of dollars!) and now the normal struggle of depression has taken hold again...,F,56,5  weeks40 MG 1X D,6/2/2014,Geodon
47, 1, bipolar,PERMANENT: itchy crawling skin_ skin eruptions all over including staph infections and acne bumps that really itch. TEMPORARY: confusion--I'll go into a room and forget what I went in there for. CONCLUSION: I will never ever ever take psych meds again--I'd rather be bipolar than take some shit that I don't know the outcome which can be permanent.,MEDICATION FROM HELL.

50, 3, Suicidal thoughts,The first dosage I took in the evening with dinner_ went to bed about 8pm and slept until 11am the next day_ that worried me_ so I skipped a day_ the next dosage_ was in the afternoon after church with dinner_ approx. 4pm_ I felt like I was high_ I was stumbling around_ I finally went to bed at 8pm_ got a few calls and text msg_ did not hear anything_ I was out unitl about 4:30am   I don't like this at all....,It helps with my insomnia_ would consider taking it_ if I had nothing to do the following day_ and I noticed I wasn't really hungry when I did eat_ but I can't take this on a regular basis,F,57,2  days20mg 1X D,11/20/2013Email,Geodon
51, 3, Psychotic disorder NOS,Tingly feeling in hands while sleeping_ extreme tiredness after taking the dose. Need 12 hours sleep or I can't function. Hangover effect if not enough sleep. Vivid crazy dreams all night long. Sleep eating. Weight gain. Can't multitask.,Started out in 80 mg a day 5 years ago. Have been slowly weaning down over the years. Terrible withdrawl symptoms with each decrease. Took a couple months to settle out with each decrease. At 20 mg noticed some anxiety but have stuck it out and switched to decaf coffe which helps. Tried to go completely off and 3 days later my vision was so blurry I could not see well. Had a hallucination when I looked into the mirror. Also felt out of body feelings. I went back on the 20 milligrams and went back to normal. No more hallucinations and my vision went back clear. My phychatrist says he does not understand how only 20 mg would do anything at all but I am living proof that it does. I know what I saw when I went off of it. Wish I could get off of it but I need to have my vision and I can't be hallucinating. I need to go to work.,F,51,5  years20mg 1X D,10/27/2013Email,Geodon

53, 5, Bipolar I,"Initially felt very ""blah"" with first dose_ such that it occurred to me this must be the mood that makes people play Sudoku. Then I went promptly to sleep for 4 hours. That feeling did not persist past day 2. I had dry eyes in the morning for the first 2 years_ but that also went away. I'm taking an unusually low dose but it works brilliantly for me. No mania_ no psychosis to distract me from the pursuit and attainment of my goals. It works nicely in concert with Lamictal_ which itself can't stop a psychotic episode (in my case) but stabilizes mood gently and fights depression.",,F,32,3  years20,7/31/2013,Geodon

55, 4, depression&Anxiety_ repeat thoughts,Major dry mouth_ sleepiness (which is why I only take it at night.,I love Geodon. I was put on it for repeating thoughts. I would sit around and think about everything that I did wrong from when I was younger to today. I guess it's a form of OCD. It is also prescribed for my depression. I am taking cymbalta for my anxiety.  This medication is great. I can look at things differently now. My thoughts are still there_ but I can stop myself and realize what I am doing_ and I can turn those thoughts around into more positive thinking.  I use to sleep a lot during the day. Sometimes I feel a little sleepy during the day but I do not sleep during the day anymore. This is a great thing! I am actually up doing things. Seeing the sun_ hanging out with my friends_ having a life. I have not had any hunger for sweets on this_ or any weight gain. I was on mirtazapine before geodon and I was hungry all of the time on mirtazapine.  On geodon I'm no longer craving just sugar. I am hungry but I'm hungry when I am suppose to be. I now can make good food decisions and eat the right thing because I am no longer hungry for just sugar. On mirtazapine I gained about 21 pounds. Since being on Geodon I have lost those 21 pounds plus more! I love this medication. I am active now and it has been easier for me to get over things that are negative. All the medication I've been on has made me gain weight_ and I've only been on this for 4 weeks_ but so far I am losing. Now I hope that the weight will stay off.  So far so good. *knocks on wood*,F,34,4  weeks60 1X D,7/26/2013,Geodon
56, 3, Bipolar,I loved Geodon.  It was the first time in my life that I could think clearly.  Unfortunately_ I had a horrible reaction.  I puked 10+ times a day.  I had horrible anxiety and could not sleep.  I also had a horrible rash on my face.  I lost 30 pound in 3 months.  I finally had to go back in the hospital and change my meds.  I continued to take the drug until I had to stop_ because I liked thinking clearly. I have to admit_ it helped me get to where I am today and that is better than I have ever been.     When anyone begins a new drug_ make sure you monitor any changes. .,I am currently taking Lithium and SEROQUEL. I am doing very well on them.,F,35,4  months60 1X D,7/20/2013Email,Geodon
57, 4, Schizophrenia,"This is the third or fourth time I post about geodon and_ every time I try to rate this drug_ I also want to comment to readers to browse on your search page: ""schizophrenia as one extreme of a sexually selected fitness indicator"" to better understand the diagnosis. Basically I'm making this comment to the person previous to this post_ since I mentioned not so long ago I work out and that when switched from risperdal to geodon_ it seems I gave the appearance of being not that big_ than when on risperdal. I gained 12 pounds in January of this year and just recently in April_ had to buy bigger clothes_ so I'm thinking my doctors put me back on 160 mg_ without me knowing_ they now my schizophrenia is severe. Those voices that I once thought were coming from my head_ now when I refer to them_ I label them as the ""system"" since now they now give advice wherever I go and are fun to be with_ so_ actually voices are normal_ only if I knew how we make this possible.",I'm in peace with local_ state and federal police_ so I know I can rely on them and they give me the impression they can rely on me_ so I'm very happy I've come this far in regards to my illness.

58, 2, mood disorder,weight loss_ extreme fatigue/feel like i just broke out of a casket when i wake up_ mood swings aren't any better_ nausea_ racing heart_ kind of a high sometimes,i went to the hospital in may last year_ took 80 mg when i was there and when i came back_ and my psych lowered it to 60. so maybe it's just this dose_ but i feel like utter crap. tho before_ when i was taking 80_ i was high all the time. so i don't recommend geodon_ overall. it's good if you gained weight from a former drug_ i guess_ and for some people it probably works_ but it doesn't for me_ go figure.,F,16,2  weeks60?? 1X D,5/8/2013Email,Geodon
59, 2, Bipolar I,It did stop my manic episode. But as it was explained to me_ atypicals (lower side effect profiles) become typical the higher the dosage. And I gained 10 pounds in a very short period of time.   Right now the internal shaking is a real downer.  I'm coming off of it and feel like I'm coming out of my skin.  The tremors got progressively worse_ not better.  This may work for people_ I just never loved it.,,F,41,3  months120mg,5/7/2013Email,Geodon
