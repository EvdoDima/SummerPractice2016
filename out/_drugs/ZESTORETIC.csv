4, 1, High blood pressure,Severe leg cramps_ foot cramps_ knee pain_ heart flutters_ back pain_ joint pain. After only 2 days of taking this drug I awoke to a excruciating shin pain. Felt like something was squeezing my legs and at same time hitting with a baseball bat. I was on Lisinopril w/out hctz 40 mg several months before this drug and I developed severe ear congestion and  muscle clicking in my right ear. Still have ear clicks.  Went off drug. Switched to Valsartan/ hctz. On it for 2 months. Same horrible effects. Bone pain_ muscle spasms in legs_ weakness_ no energy_ hair thinning.   After being on all three of these drugs for a total of approx. 5 months _ I feel like I am 90 years old.  I so much want this out of my system !  I just hope and pray there is no permanent damage. I had to take a leave of absence from work due to these drugs.,THIS IS POISON.  Do NOT take this drug. I am thankful for this site for I now know my symptoms are not from some other disease.  These drug companies claim these side effects are very rare.  Not so. they should be taken off the market.,F,49,23  days20 / 25 mg 1X D,9/23/2014,Zestoretic
5, 2, hypertension 150-170/90-100,My doc put me on this drug for my hypertension_ and told me to watch for cough_ as the most distressing symptom. I never experienced that_ but did have headaches a lot_ even when my BP was not elevated. That could be attributed to it. It worked mediocre_ I'd say_ for me. It lowered my BP sometimes_ but wasn't consistent. It might be 110-132 when I'd first wake up_ and throughout the day_ would be in the 130s to 150s_ sometimes as much as 160. It just depended. I also started on Synthroid at the same time_ and began having other symptoms such as: hair loss_ weight gain_ nipple discharge_ irregular menstruations_ headaches_ and dizziness. The dizziness was only the first 2 days. So I attributed many of these symptoms being from the synthroid. After discussing with my doc_ he thinks many of these (minus the female problems) are side effects of the Zestoretic. He's seen this in other patients and discussed it before with pharmacists. Due to my BP not being lowered as much as he wants and the ill-effects of the diuretic part of the drug_ he is discontinuing this drug and starting me on another one.,,F,29,7  weeks10mg,6/7/2013Email,Zestoretic

15, 2, hypertension,Shortly after I began taking this medication I developed a horrible cough. I have been taking this medication for 6months and the cough has just gotten worse.I cough so hard at times I can hardly breath. Tomorrow I am going to see my doctor and I will ask for something different. Benicar w/hctz seems to have less of the horrible side effects.

17, 1, High Blood Pressure,Already had problems with my erections but was getting by. A couple of weeks after taking Zestoretic penetration became impossible because of the diuretic in Zestoretic. Turns out that diuretics (Chlorothiazide in this case) are a known factor in causing Impotence in a high percentage of males.,Luckily my Dr increased the dosage to 40mg. Zestoretic doesn't come in 40mg dosages so he prescribed Lisinopril 40mg and Chlorothiazide (diuretic in Zestoretic). I was in my late fifties at the time and coping with serious erectile difficulties which I attributed to aging. Not so_ I found out. At least not the only cause. When I finally talked to another Dr he confirmed the problems were probably being caused by the Chlorothiazide. On my own I stopped taking the diuretic on weekends and after some improvement erection-wise I stopped it altogether. I still take Zestril 40mg and my blood pressure is down and my erections are up (okay_ as good as a sixty-something male could hope for anyway).,M,66,4  weeks,6/30/2007Email,Zestoretic

21, 4, Hypertension,"None. Most side effects I read about on this site are over-hyped. People get caught up in ""creating"" side effects. I'm an RN and I rarely see any side effects_ other than cough for this medication.",Combination ACE Inhibitor/Thiazide diuretic works extremely well in controlling hypertension; the benefit is through the synergistic effect the two drugs have on the renin-angiotension-aldostersone mechanism.,F,36,8  months,4/6/2007,Zestoretic
