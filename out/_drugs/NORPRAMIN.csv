0, 2, Atypical Depression,Dry Mouth_ Dizziness_ LIght headedness_ decreased libido_ Pressure changes in my ears_ difficulty exercising without almost passing out_ fatigue,I took as an augmentation to Paxil (20mg). I've only been on it for 2 weeks_ but I'm ready to quit from the side effects.,M,40,2  weeks50mg 1X D,6/17/2014Email,Norpramin
1, 3, Tension Headache,Early waking ... sedation ... increased libido ... mind numbing,"This medication saved my life back in the 90s.  I had a severe chronic headache that was diagnosed as psychosis and until I went to a neurologist and explained him my head pain_ it went untreated.  Even a 10mg my pain in my head decreased by half!  I was really suicidal at the time and Desipramine saved my life.  The ONLY negative thing about it was that it made me rise early and made me a little tired during the day which acted to depress me.  But it does work for nasty head pain and for that I'm thankful.  I found out a few years later that a dose of Zyprexa along with Despramine keeps you asleep longer.  That's what I take to this day for my neuro/psyche problems. I have never had to increase my dose all these years.  It works like a tryciclic ""aspirin"" of sorts.",M,46,10  years25mg 1X D,4/27/2012Email,Norpramin
2, 5, bipolar II/SAD depression,dizziness_ dry mouth_ weight gain,have taken desipramine since 1987. An older drug_ docs will tell you it has more side effects than SSRIs or that it will switch bipolar depression to hypomania. Not true for me!  was transferred to SSRI for 2 years_ and had such a horrible experience I refuse any anti-depressant now except desipramine. After a few months on desipramine_ all side effects will dissipate.  Always lost weight or had no weight effect on this drug until last year when it changed manufacturers. I think they reformulated it_ because now I have a desire for sweets that I never had before on this drug.  But it's still worth it. Completely stops SAD inability to get out of bed in morning. If SSRI side effects are bad for you_ try desipramine (if you're bipolar_ make sure to take a mood stabilizer at the same time).,M,42,25  years100 mg 1X D,11/14/2010Email,Norpramin
3, 1, major depression,Had extreme agitation_ mood swings_ crying fits_ difficult getting out of bed every day...and all this 4 weeks before my wedding.,The doctor had me take this after a round of ECT to try and maintain the benefits of the treatments-BAD IDEA.  I'm surprised my fiance didn't postpone our wedding because of how bad off I was from the side effects.  The dr. had me taper the dosage back down and gave me xanax to help calm me down to come off of it.,F,28,1  months,4/10/2009,Norpramin
4, 1, Decrease peripheral neuropathy pain,difficulty breathing_ increasing shortness of breath_ difficulty urinating_ increased heart rate_ excessive sweating_ heat stroke.,Do not take this drug under any circumstances.,F,66,6  months,7/18/2008,Norpramin
5, 2, depression anxiety,sleeplessness dry mouth increased body temp,took 25mg in morning 50mg at night could not sleep made me speedy felt more anxious only take 25mg now and i sleep fine but still feel sad,F,33,6  weeks,6/11/2007,Norpramin
6, 3, Depression_ snappiness_inattention,Urination 3 times a night; increased pulse; reduced tolerance for physical activity; gas; non-existent sex drive.,Norpramin 10mg (the smallest pill) once a day for the past 11 days.  Started at the lowest dosage and am working upwards.  It has bad side effects listed on the left_ so I've set limits for this medication: (1) I take it in the morning; taking it in the afternoon means that I'd have trouble staying asleep; (2) I take Toprol XL 25 mg. 2 hours prior to Norpramin to counteract the increased pulse resulting from Norpramin; (3) If I exercise_ I delay Norpramin; and (4) I've taken a one-day drug holiday after 10 days because I felt it was getting too much for me.  On the plus side: much better thinking_ less distraction_ less anxiety_ friedliness to family.  With Norpramin_ I've become a normal person and people now want to deal with me. When you're taking toxic pills like Norpramin_ forget about the dosages recommended by the manufacturer and your doctor.  You're the only judge.  Start with the lowest dosage and work upwards.,M,44,11  days,3/24/2007,Norpramin
7, 5, depression & anxiety,dry mouth_ increased cravings for sweets; some agitation--but not always,This is not commonly prescribed anymore_ bc it is one of the 'older' antidepressants. But I think the side effects are actually must less than the newer drugs like Prozac. This drug helped me a great deal_ I fell asleep at night_ slept  more deeply and woke up refreshed- for the first time in 5 years since having depression. It gave more energy during the day and less anxiety. The problem was that these positive effects began wearing off and when the dose increased_ I got some nasty agitation. I would not rule out taking it again however. Also a good thing: I had no sexual side effects with this med at all.,F,38,1  years,3/1/2004,Norpramin
