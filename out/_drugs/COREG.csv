0, 5, Heart Failure,None,I have no complaints whatsoever with this medication_ it has been a Godsend for me thus far. I was experiencing extreme fatigue with even the slightest amount of exertion_ could only walk very short distances_ and had to sleep in a recliner because I couldn't lie down flat because I'd have trouble breathing. Coreg removed all of those symptoms_ this week I started a daily walking routine and can now do a whole mile without being exhausted. I plan to increase that distance soon. I am extremely satisfied with this medication.,M,49,1  months39 mg,5/26/2016Email,Coreg

In May 2014_ I was rushed to the ER having threatened a stroke and going into heart failure_ and one week prior to this_ terrible thigh and ankle swelling like I had NEVER seen before!  I found that after having my son_ 2008_ that I had been slowly developing heart failure.  My heart just could not keep up with my regular_ sedentary_ office all day lifestyle.  Long story short_ I had a 15% ejection fraction rate_ they believe I had a mini stroke_ as those symptoms quickly dissipated once I was on IV Lasix_ and losing all that fluid!  Needless to say_ I am over a year out on this thing_ my current EFR is now a wonderful 66% and I feel so much better!  I started this journey on about 9 different meds_ whereas I hadn't had to take a single prescription in my life!  Now I am on only 3 of those meds and while I still am not 100% activity level wise_ I am thankful for my LIFE and Coreg!

15, 1, High blood pressure,"After 5 by-passes in 2007_ I was placed on another beta blocker called Toprol which put 45 lbs on me in 10 months.  After a lower back operation in 2013_ three months later my blood pressure went up to 205/85.  Due this peak rise_ I was placed on another beta blocker called Coreg/Carvedilol.  I experienced such high nausea and dizziness that some days I could not even get out of bed for days.  Finally after 10 months_ my doctors took me off of this beta blocker after my health complaints and gaining another 10 lbs. The sad truth is I am still having the nausea and dizziness plus now aching in my joints especially in my feet.  On many days_ I do not think I am going to make it to the next.  I am now going to the gym five times a week due to the workout_ especially the treadmill_ making me feel better.

Sometimes they develop so slowly that you don't realize it's the meds causing the problem.,At this dose_ it helped BP moderately_ but lowered heart rate to 50. Did not control anxiety or palpitations. Could not increase dose because of heart rate and other side effects.
