0, 5, Severe Allergic Rhinitis,Sleepiness_ but only towards the evening when I take it. I usually wake up refreshed.,I have struggled a lot with finding the right allergy medication_ and this was a miracle med!,F,21,7  days5 mg 1X D,8/10/2016,Xyzal
1, 1, Allergies:Mold_dust_ trees_ grass,"After discontinuing use sever ITCHING! The first time a few years ago I tried to stop taking it I itched so badly I thought ""Wow I really do need Xyzal"" and started taking it again. This time I googled and hello.  This stuff is addictive. Never again folks! Going to get my doc to prescribe something for the hives and I'm done.",Don't risk it!  I had NO idea and now I'm convinced discontinuing Xyzal is my problem. Not my allergies itself.  There are safer options.  This should be listed as a side effect.  Uncontrollable itching!,F,52,5  years5 mg 1X D,6/12/2016,Xyzal
2, 1, Seasonal allergies,Xyzal is the only sinus medicine I have ever taken That truely helped my allergies... That being said I only need medicine from April to June when my allergies are the worst... I stopped taking it three days ago and have had the worst withdrawal itching all over I have ever experienced... This medicine has a component of Zyrtec (cyterezine) in it-doing some research it looks like coming off of Zyrtec causes the same crazy itching... I will never take this medicine again,,F,31,2  months30,6/4/2016,Xyzal
3, 1, Hives allergies itching,Having hives type break out and this medication cleared it up. However I felt drugged up so I took it at night. I used to be able to take a 90 min spin class but I barely complete a 45 min one. My output have dropped 200. I told dr i have gained weight and I am tired all the time. Dr said it shouldn't be this rx. I wish I had read these reviews earlier. I will never take this medication again. I would rather have hives,,F,54,2  months30,5/31/2016Email,Xyzal
4, 1, sinus and allergy problems,Headaches_ difficulty concentrating_ anxiety_ nervous_ restless_ lethargy_ wakefulness during the night_ bad dreams_ elevated BP.,It took me 10 days to realize my symptoms started with the use of the medication.  I was so tired when I got up in the morning and would start the day with a headache.  Really concerned me that my BP was higher than usual.  Decided it was time to DC the med.,F,,10  days5 mg 1X D,5/20/2016,Xyzal

6, 2, Year Round Allergies/Chronic Sinus/,Drowsiness_ drugged feeling_ & significant mood disturbance.,The drug seems very effective and improved sinus symptoms and hives. My Doctor suggested a trial to see if I had the same side effects that I experienced when taking otc Zyrtec. Everything was great for 3 days and out of the blue and for no reason began feeling very depressed_ crying over things and this strange black and white/catastrophic thinking. I continued taking it for a week and was hoping that this side effect would go away. It didn't. I took one pill a week later in hopes of alleviating 4 days of hives and itching. I was fine the first 12 hours and after that my mood began falling. As I neared the 24 hour mark I became increasing depressed and teary. I am not at any point in my cycle where my moods would be affected this way_ nor are there any significant stressors in my life_ just normal everyday things.,F,40,7  days10 1X D,4/27/2016,Xyzal

9, 1, Hives,After trying JUST ONE 5 MG tablet_ I have GAINED 8 POUNDS in 7 DAYS. My weight hasn't fluctuated since I can't remember when -- maybe when I was in college?,The reason why I took Xyzal for just one day is because my hives went away the next day. Now you could blame me for this but I wasn't prescribed the med_ just given one tablet from a friend to see if it would help my (non-chronic) hives. Is this what I deserve? Will this weight go away on its own since I just took one tablet for one day?,F,37,1  days5 MG,8/30/2015Email,Xyzal

12, 2, Indoor Allergies,Hives_ chest tightening_ coughing jags,For me_ Xyzal is a bad drug. It gave me hives_ a 2-4 hour coughing jag after taking it_ tingling lips_ a tight cheat_ trill voice_ basically an anaphylactic reaction to the levocertizine which is the main component of the drug. I stopped taking it and have asked my Allergist to prescribe something else. Hopefully the hives will get a lot better soon.,F,48,10  days5mg,6/28/2015,Xyzal
13, 3, Non-allergic Rhinitis,It helped with the allergic symptoms_ but the downside was the weight gain. I exercise 60-90 minutes a day_ but within a week of starting the medicine I had gained a few pounds. After a month_ I'd gained 7 pounds even though nothing had changed in my diet or exercise routine. I'm talking to my doctor about other options because I really don't want to buy a new wardrobe.,,M,35,1  months,6/24/2015,Xyzal

16, 4, Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (Hives,EXTREME_ SEVERE Fatigue.  I wake up every morning feeling drugged or hungover.  It takes me quite a bit of time to become fully awake.  This has affected my livlihood; even though I set my own hours_ I am working less because of the fatigue.  I tried taking it earlier in the evening at around 5- 6pm and I struggle to wake up at 8am!  I am tired and lethargic most days and struggle to stay awake.  I've become heavily dependent on coffee which only helps marginally.  I've also gained a considerable amount of weight (20 lbs) despite limiting myself to 1200 calories a day and working out heavily (kickboxing_ interval training_ weight training) - can't fit a single thing in my closet and the scale won't stop going up!.  At first I didn't put it all together_ but after reading about others' side effects_ this med must be the culprit! VERY frustrating!,This med has worked SO well for me after suffering from CIU for over 14 years.  However_ the weight gain and fatigue are becoming more than I can bare.  I'm going to go off of it for a couple of weeks to see if the side effects go away.  Back to taking 4 tabs of Allegra everyday -- what fun!!,F,37,6  months5 MG 1X D,4/4/2015,Xyzal

19, 1, Seasonal allergies,Insomnia_ anxiety_ depression,I took XYZAL for 30 days before I realized what it was doing to me.  I would wake up 2 -3 hours after going to sleep and have strong feelings of anxiety and depression.  The lack of sleep caused even more anxiety.  I was at the point of needing anti-depressants when I figured it out.  All anxiety and sleeping issues went away after two days without Xyzal.  Will never take this med again.,M,45,30  days5 mg 1X D,9/29/2014,Xyzal
20, 1, Allergies and Eczema,Xyzal has done wonders for my toddlers allergies and has helped to calm her Eczema. However_ a week on the medicine she been having behavior issuses. From a child that was always happy_ smiling and loving to a very aggressive and anxious child. The allergist said to continue the Xyzal that it had nothing to do with her behavior issues. I continue the Xyzal_ but things got worse about ten minutes after I'd give her medicine she would go wild_ she would scream and cry for no reason. She had started being very aggressive with other child pushing and hitting even adults. This is not my baby_ she's a monster. I blew it off as a phase. Two days off the medicine I'm already seeing a change in her behavior. I'll deal with the allergies and eczema the best I can a natural way.,,F,2,2  months,9/19/2014Email,Xyzal
21, 3, Allergies,Was taking the generic Levoceterine for roughly three months and was very satisfied with the results it had on my sinus issues due to allergies. However_ within those three months my sleep became very irregular_ I gained 10 pounds and seemed to never be not hungry. I stopped taking the medication a few days ago and already my energy level has increased_ my hunger has gone back to normal_ and my sleep has become regular again. Of course my sinuses are already starting to act up ever so slightly again. I wish this med worked without those side effects because it truly did help with what I needed the help with in the first place_ but not worth the weight gain.,,M,34,3  months5mg 1X day,8/28/2014Email,Xyzal

24, 1, Severe Allergies,Extremely tired through out entire day.  Weight Gain.,I have taken XYZAL for a few years.  In the last 1 1/2 years I realized how tired I was all the time_ how I had no energy anymore to get things done_ and how foggy my thoughts were.  I have 3 children and a busy schedule so I brushed this off for a long time as just being worn out at the end of my day.  But about a year ago my allergist asked me how I was doing and I told him that I just seem to be getting more and more tired_ have had intense headaches and could not figure out where my energy went.  He asked me to stop using XYZAL and see what happens.  I started feeling more energetic almost immediately.  I have severe allergies at certain times through out the year and XYZAL has worked so good at helping control them.  I wished I would have realized sooner that it was this medicine causing such issues in my life.  And I recently put the medicine to the test - took it before getting my allergy shots.  I became extremely tired driving home (about a 40min drive)_ wanted to sleep all day_ went to bed before the entire family and woke up the next morning so groggy and tired I just wanted to go back to sleep.  I will be finding an alternative to taking this medication.  It's ruled my life long enough.,F,43,2  years5mg 1X D,3/7/2014Email,Xyzal
25, 4, Allergies - Meniere's symptoms,Fatigue_ bad dreams_ lethargy_ increased appetite_ sleeplessness_ moodiness muscle fatigue_ major weight gain.,Xyzal ended years of suffering from Meniere's-like symptoms. But_ gained 40lbs the first year. Friends/family shocked at my weight change_ urged me to try other treatments. Needed a break from the persistent feelings of hunger_ fatigue_ nightmares_ moodiness. So_ quit the Xyzal for 8 months.  Lost 20 lbs. Sleep and energy levels returned to normal.  But_ Meniere's symptoms came back too.  Quickly went back on Xyzal.  Meniere's symptoms went away again; ugly side-effects came back too. Gained 40+ more lbs; up 60 lbs since the beginning of 2012 (still gaining). The bad sides are so distinct that I'm convinced they are from the Xyzal. Even so_ I've concluded that I'd rather be a fat guy than go deaf with severe vertigo and the risk of losing my drivers license.  Still researching new treatment methods so I can get off Xyzal_ though.,M,45,1.8  years10mg 1X D,10/13/2013Email,Xyzal
26, 5, Severe allergies and severe asthma,I have taken every allergy medicine out there with no success. Even taking 10mg of Xyzal a day I still have bad allergies_ but it is the best it has been in years. Since increasing to 10mg my asthma has improved slightly and I don't use my rescue inhaler as often. Luckily I have no side effects from it_ because it has been the best thing that has happened to me!!,,F,27,6  months10mg,8/30/2013,Xyzal
27, 2, Seasonal allergies.,Somnolence_ depression_ weight gain_ vivid dreams (not real pleasant).,"I was so happy to read other's comments about Xyzal. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I took it for 3 months_ May through mid-August_ because I have seasonal_ dust_ and dust mite allergies. I broke the 5 mg tablet in half and took only 1/2 of it each night when I realized I didn't need the full 5 mg to control symptoms. I enjoyed how it made me sleep so much better than usual. However_ over the months my dreams became more unpleasant and vivid_ and I became much less ""myself"" and more depressed_ also I gained 4-5 pounds even though diet and activity remained the same. And all this on only a pediatric dose (I'm an adult). I didn't take it last night and woke up feeling very different and much better mood-wise. Just normal again. Kind of cheerful and optimistic. I hope that the extra pounds go away of their own accord as well! I plan to use Nasonex and try Claritin next Spring_ or use Xyzal very sparingly for short periods of time only.",F,56,14  weeks2.5 1X D,8/12/2013Email,Xyzal
28, 2, Autoimmune uticaria,Extreme fatigue_ mental fogginess and weight gain. I had no idea that this medication was causing the problems it was. It did help relieve my hives but is SO not worth it. I could barely get out of bed after 10 hours of sleep and gained 25 pounds despite working out and eating healthy. I have been off for 2 days and have lost 4 pounds. I am having trouble sleeping now but hoping this will resolve the longer I am off the drug. Doctors do not acknowledge these side effects and will tell you the drug does not cause these things but it really_ really does!! I feel more awake and so much less foggy. I had no idea how foggy I was all day until I quit taking it.,,F,45,7  months5mg,7/18/2013Email,Xyzal

30, 4, Allergies to Mold & Pollen,Possibly way more than I thought there were...,I have been taking this for years - it's the ONLY allergy medicine that has worked for my inner-ear allergies.  I used to take Claritin every day and a Benedryl every 4 hours (NOT GOOD!).  However_ I stopped taking it 3 days ago (my prescription ran out) & I'm itching like crazy!  If it really is from the XYZAL_ I wonder what other side effects I've been experiencing that I didn't associate with this drug.  I've had pretty poor health (up and down blood sugar_ pain in muscles_ brain fog) for a similar amount of time_ and have tried a lot of things to get back to feeling normal.... The light bulb is clicking!,F,26,3  years5 mg 1X D,11/30/2012,Xyzal

33, 5, Year around allergies,No side effects; works wonderfully,I'm curious if after a length of time your body can build up a resistance to XYZAL? I've been on it for over 3 years with no issues and all of the sudden it's like I'm not even taking anything for my allergies at all - sneezing_ running nose (clear)_ itchy-burning-scratchy eyes_ eye drainage_ etc... Maybe my dosage just needs to be increased? Or should I ask the doctor for a different prescribtion?,F,46,3  years10 MG 1X D,10/16/2012Email,Xyzal
34, 4, Year round allergies,I have done very well taking this medication to control my allergies.  However_ my Dr. advised me to stop taking it for 7 days prior to allergy testing.  With withdrawal of the Xyzal I am experiencing ITCHING_ it is very bothersome.  It has been one week since stopping the Xyzal and the itching has not ceased.  With this as a withdrawal symptom I am inclined to not take this medication in the future.,,F,51,2  years5 mg 1X D,8/21/2012Email,Xyzal
35, 3, Allergies_ Dermatitis,First_ it works great as a sleeping pill before bed time. As good as most sleeping pills. Great antihistamine too. But I noticed depression in the morning after a full dose. I cut the nightly dose in half and that seems to cut back on the morning depression. This should be listed as a side effect!,,M,42,2  years20 1X D,8/4/2012Email,Xyzal

40, 4, Asthma_ Exteme allergies,I have not noticed any pronounced side effects. I took zyrtec for a year. I got used to the drowsiness after about a week and it did not bother me either. I did gain some weight on it but not too drastic. Side effects with Xyzal seem to be less.,I took Zyrtec for a year. It changed my life. It was the only thing that helped my chronic severe tightness in my bronchial tubes. It was like a miracle drug...until one day I guess my body got too used to it and it quit working. I was miserable again for quite a while until I heard about Xyzal and decided to try it. So far_ it seems to be working. My fear is that a few months later I will have the same problem as I did with Zyrtec. I wonder if anyone on here has had a similar experience and has advice on how to avoid this drug loosing its effectiveness. If so please chime in.,M,56,14  days5mg 1X D,1/9/2012Email,Xyzal
41, 3, Pulmonary allergies,Trouble getting up in morning on 5 MGM dose but better on 2.5 mgm. Felt a little depressed in general_ some dizziness. After coming off drug felt terrible- dizzy_ nauseated_ hot flashes last few days. Saw 2 doctors- may have affected my balance centers.,Seemed to help in the beginning- allergic to mold_ dust mite and tree pollen.Not sure taking it day after day for many months is a good idea because I think withdrawal occurs within a few days of stopping. When I took it intermittently last few days it seemed withdrawal got better when I took it again but now I need to get off it. No return of allergy symptoms though. I am a retired nurse anesthetist and no other concurrent meds or medical problems.,F,69,7  months2.5 to 5mg 1X D,11/18/2011,Xyzal
42, 3, itchiness from eczema,I have only taken it a couple times because each time i take it the medicine knocks me out and then I wake up in the middle of the night from the sound of a fly or a bug. It always seems like the bug lands on my face and/or in my eye. It is the weirdest thing. I even get up look around my room to see if there is a bug. It helps me not itch at night but then I feel like I have flies in my eye,,F,24,1  days2.5 mg 1X D,9/26/2011Email,Xyzal
43, 1, Allergies,intense joint pain that made it difficult to stand up.,I am very healthy.  The Xyzal really helped with the allergy symptoms but it was not worth the intense whole body joint pain that i experienced.  I stopped taking the Xyzal and noticed improvement in my symtpoms within three days and was back to normal within 15 days.,F,36,30  days 1X D,8/25/2011,Xyzal
44, 2, Allergies and hives,If I take it_ that starts a BAD day. And I happen to take it EVERY day_ along with SIngulair. If I take it_ I'm VERY anxious_ irritable_ and depressed. My friends all thought I was bipolar. If I forget to take it_ I'm in a happy_ cheerful_ optimistic and calm mood all day_ but I'm covered in hives.,Only thing that helps the allergies. Does wonders on hives. (still am taking it) So_ I recommend it if you HATE hives_ but to stop it if you start feeling depressed or anxious. I notice a difference in the mental/mood related stuff almost immediately. The depression from it is really... not good... It's a bit like waking up and putting on a pair of glasses that filter the good out of the world before you can see it.,F,15,3  months5 1X D,8/20/2011,Xyzal
45, 5, Chronic Sinus Infections and Hives,Get very itchy for a week or two if I stop taking Xyzal_ but have found taking Claritin for that time makes the itching go away.,I had chronic sinus infections while taking other allergy medicines (primarily Claritin and Allegra).

Couldn't focus on work and struggled to stay awake behind the wheel.,It is more effective than drugs like Clarityn_ but then again none of them are very effective for the clogged up sinuses and catarrh symptoms of hayfever.

I was so tired I could barely function.  I am normally a very happy_ patient mom.  After 2 days of taking this medication I was screaming at my kids.  I was also driving my car very fast_ which I never do.  I think this is a very dangerous medication. I am disappointed that my doctor didn't warn me about these side effects.

The dreams are insane_but I don't mind them because I can't seem to hold a thought for long on Xyzal. this pill takes a while to kick in at night_ once I'm passed out or in a mild coma i'm unable to scratch_ when i wake up my skin feels slightly numb (which is great for me) the itchies come back around 11 ish in the day and comes on full force around 2 PM. Wish I could take 2 doses but might end up in a coma forever. I think i have permanent white scars from the itchies :( because i kept scratching my wounds. I'm now depressed over that. :.{,I've have an unknown uncontrollable itch all over my body. Everything (cortizone shots_ benadryl_ zertec_ every lotion prescribed didn't work. Xyzal didn't get rid of the itch but at least i'm not cutting my skin and bleeding all over the place like i used to.,F,31,14  days5 MG 1X D,12/5/2010,Xyzal
58, 2, hives and sinus alleries,routine bloodwork turned up seriously elevated liver enzymes after one month on this which were normal 6 months ago. Why aren't there warnings about liver damage? Damaging my liver to block my allergies is not a good deal.,It worked on my allergies.,F,58,30  days5 1X D,11/14/2010Email,Xyzal
59, 2, dust mite allergy,Constant sweet cravings.Extremely rapid weight gain (15 lbs in 3 weeks_ 3 pant sizes - size 4 to a size 10!!) lethargy_ depression (I have Bipolar Disorder which has been under control for years with meds),This definitely helped with my allergies_ but the side effects are intolerable. Plus_ I paid the norm $100 for a month's supply_ because insurance will not cover it.  I should have taken that as a sign!,F,36,3  weeks5 mg 1X D,10/27/2010Email,Xyzal
