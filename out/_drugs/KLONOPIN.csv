2, 5, Panic attacks,I became physically addicted to low--dose (.5mg)  Klonopin after about a year of use - and I couldn't care less.,I am physically addicted to Klonopin and I couldn't care less. I mean_ if I had diabetes I would need an insulin shot to function and I see no difference. I am allergic to SSRI's and Marijuana induces panic attacks for me so I have no alternative.  I take a small dose - .5 Mg - and have never had to increase it to get the therapeutic benefit I need.  My panic attacks were so severe I was close to suicide. After suffering for 20 years I was ready to give up when a British psychiatrist new to the US scoffed at my symptoms and   He said there is no reason to suffer like I was suffering and took me off anti-depressent (prozac at the time) and prescribed the .5 Klonopin. That man saved my life.  Now_ I have never even thought to abuse Klonopin as for me it is simply medicine.  Same with Oxycodone after 3 surgery's. It's medicine and you take it as directed and stop taking it when you don't need it.  For people like me the benefits far_ far outweigh any risk. The bottom line is that my panic attacks were so severe as to be dibilitating and this drug save me when I was 43 years old. I'm 65 now and still working a high-tech job effectively enough to receive accolades for my work as well as great performance reviews that result in bonuses and pay raises. I think there are many_ many people like me who use a low dose_ don't abuse it_ and reap great benefit from anxiety relief. Tell me it will give me Alzheimers in 10 years and I'll tell you it's been more than worth it for me.,M,,25  years.5 1X D,6/18/2016Email,Klonopin
3, 5, Anxiety and crazy amount of stress,Sleepy_ relaxed_ can get a little short tempered the day after and mildly down mood the next day,Stops obsessive worry and allows me to eat and relax when my anxiety is high.

4, 4, Atypical Trigeminal Neuropathy,Initial tired feeling but that subsided after a couple of weeks,I am taking this for a neuropathic condition - not sure if that's considered off-label use - but it seems to sometimes help with my pain.

I have also found that it does calm me down and I am able to take things a bit more in-stride.,M,59,4  months.5 4X D,5/20/2016Email,Klonopin
5, 5, OCD and panic disorder,Felt somewhat loopy the first few weeks of taking Klonopin. The loopy feeling went away as I got used to the medicine.,Klonopin helps my anxiety tremendously. I know a lot of people are scared of taking Klonopin because of the fear of getting addicted but as long as you take it the way you're supposed to and don't abuse it you will be okay. My racing thoughts are practically gone and I almost never have a panic attack now. I used to spend almost every waking moment living in fear to the point where I was terrified to get out of bed and now I'm a functional member of society. My anxiety used to torment my mind and I had no way to stop the obsessive thoughts but Klonopin has helped me enough that I can do all the things I never thought I would be able to do because I was too scared.,F,22,5  years1 mg,5/17/2016,Klonopin

8, 5, Insomnia,No side effects at all.  Just a wonderful nights sleep.,I originally took it for a few months for severe anxiety_ 1 mg every 6 hours (4 mg a day). I found it also made me sleepy.  After a few months_ under a doctors care_ I started to reduce my dosage.  I no longer take it for anxiety_ but now I take it about once a week or so for insomnia and it gives me a great nights sleep.  All I need now is .25 mg for sleep.  I am shocked to hear that people get addicted to this drug.  It was easy for me to dose down without issues.  I tried Xanax initially_ but that drug does not last long enough for me.,F,52,2  years.25 mg 1X W,4/20/2016,Klonopin

I was prescribed this along with another medication for acute dystonia. The efficacy of this drug was not discussed with me. Apparently around 15% effective in dystonia. I did NOT provide informed consent. The neurologist was in complete denial about the side effects and potential for tolerance withdrawal which is truly scandalous and I was therefore left on it for months longer. He then gave me a dangerous regime for withdrawal. Withdrawal was truly horrendous and 6 months on I am still suffering the withdrawal symptoms of low mood_ insomnia_ anger_ tearfulness_ pins and needles_ fasiculations_ muscle twitching and vibrating sensations in my legs. So devastated I took this drug. It also increases your risk of developing dementia. BAD BAD BAD.,F,,10  months0.5mcg 2X D,3/28/2016,Klonopin

16, 4, Neck Tremor-Dystonia,I use it for my neck tremors and anxiety. I'm now able to be in public and not feel embarrassed anymore. It doesn't work 100% for me so I may in time increase my dose at some point. If I go without it for a few days to give my body a break it makes me feel off balanced_ like walking on a boat with a heavy spacy head and mild anxiety_ so it can be annoying If you choose to do that. Once I take it again I'm totally fine again.,If I decide to get off it I would defiantly wean from it to limit the withdrawals I mentioned. It's not a scary drug at all from my experience so far. So if your Dr. suggest it I would try it because I was scared at first too_ but now I'm not at all and best of all it does help with my neck tremors and anxiety.,F,51,1  years1mg 2X D,2/25/2016,Klonopin
17, 1, Anxiety and Panic Attacks,Headache_ nausea_ rapid heartbeat_ nightmares_ insomnia.,I had my first panic attack at 19 and after a month of hell_ decided to see a psychiatrist who prescribed me Xanax. I took them when I felt a panic attack coming on and xanax stopped it right in its tracks. Eventually_ just the comfort of having the Xanax around stopped the panic attacks. I stopped fearing the fear and stopped seeing a therapist for awhile. Fast forward to the birth of my daughter - I started experiencing post partum anxiety ten times worse than the worst panic attack of my life 24/7. I went to the ER several times and the only thing they could find was slightly elevated blood pressure. Was referred to a psychiatrist who basically made Xanax out to be worse than heroin. Her alternative was Klonopin and over the course of the 5 days taking this stuff_ I'm surprised I didn't commit suicide. I contemplated it; that's how bad it made me feel. Maybe it just didn't agree with my body chemistry but wow_ in addition to the side effects above_ I lost almost all my baby weight from the nausea and lack of appetite. I did not sleep at all; I was sleeping better having a cup of chamomile tea before bed! So_ I looked up the psychiatrist I was seeing back in college and he was still practicing. I felt relief just walking into his office. Went home with my prescription for Xanax and I'm back to just knowing relief is there and how it can stop and prevent a panic attack is enough. I rarely have to use it and suffer absolutely no bizarre side effects. Maybe for mild general an,F,34,5  days,2/1/2016Email,Klonopin
18, 5, Anxiety_ Panic Attacks,,No other drug works for me. I was prescribed this over 10 years ago. I had such bad anxiety and panic attacks I ended up in the hospital 3 times. I was prescribed this and My panic attacks and anxiety were mostly under control. I do not have any sode effects. I am not tired anymore than a normal person_ don't get dizzy or anything else. I have tried to come off of it multiple times because my parents thought it was bad for me to be on for a long time. I had such bad anxiety/withdrawls that I had to go back on it everytime.

22, 2, Restless Leg Syndrome_ Insomnia,Fatigue_ joints pain (elbows_ knees)_ light sleep_ withdrawal symptoms (anxiety_ memory loss),I was prescribed this because of leg movements during the night which could have been the cause of my fragmented sleep and lack of REM sleep. Even at the lowest dose it didn't work_ deep sleep and REM sleep became scarcer. The pain in my knee was severe and caused many sleepless nights. And like with all benzodiazepines quitting proved difficult_ because of the increased anxiety and the memory loss. The only positive thing about this drug is that it helps with social anxiety. During the time I was on it I was much more open and talkative. But the side effects are not worth it imo. I also discovered that taking this drug with (lemon) verbena herbal tea increased its effects.,M,42,6  months0.3 MG 1X D,11/27/2015EmailHistory,Klonopin

26, 2, Anxiety,Brain fog_ drowsiness_ pancreatitis_ dizziness,I have a rare pancreatic/biliary disorder that causes nausea and vomiting. Klonopin helped treat these symptoms plus the overwhelming anxiety that accompany my condition. Problem is when I wanted to go off it I entered a living nightmare. I did a very slow taper over 9 months. By the 6 month mark I started getting pancreatic attacks. I figured it was part of my condition_ but noticed the attacks worsened on days I lowered my dose. I went off Klonopin entirely and was dizzy for a month. It felt like I was on a boat. I'd get nausea_ panic attacks_ and the pancreatic pain was beyond what pain medication could touch. I cannot believe this medication caused such bad withdrawal and for so long! I will never take a benzo again.,F,46,3  years.25 mg 2X D,10/9/2015Email,Klonopin

It does help anxiety a little bit but the side effects are horrible. I discourage anyone to take this medication. I pray that my fiance wakes up and switches to something else because he will not listen to me. Other people have told him the same thing and have warned him about the way he acts on it but he doesn't listen.

The symptoms are horrendous and its very addicting and nearly impossible to get off of. The symptoms of rebound and withdrawal are almost unbearable. This drug caused my depression to increase to the point in which I was suicidal and it created extreme anxiety on the rebound. When the dose wears off Your original symptoms return ten fold. I strongly urge anyone to avoid this type of drug . Avoid caffeine on this med and when tapering off. I have been off clonazepam for four months after so called short term and still going through horrific nightmares and other symptoms of dementia. I truly believe this drug has changed the physiology of My brain. My memory is really bad and I feel so tired all the time as I can no longer reach deep sleep stages. I wake tired and very soar and unrested. Avoid this and other benzodiazepines at all cost. Both My Doctor and pharmacist were inept regarding this drug. They told Me to just taking it and I did.

On it for 9 years and my primary care doc kept writing scripts instead of talking to me and seeing if I really needed this addicting drug for so long.,Don't take it! I tried to cold turkey it last July. Big mistake! Ended up in the ER twice. They thought I was showing signs of ms and did a brain MRI on me. I don't have ms. It was all horrible withdrawl symptons! I went back on but have been slowly weaning since then. Every time I wean I have withdrawl of course not as severe as cold turkey but it's terrible. I hope to be free of this drug by this July a year after ending up in the ER. I want the old me back!,F,51,9  years0.5 mg 4x,4/8/2015,Klonopin
53, 1, Anxiety,Glassy eyed_ tired_ lethargic_ headache,I was on Klonopin six years ago for a couple of months and then crossed over to Valium and tapered for a month. I had severe muscle aches_ chemical anxiety_ and insomnia (3-4 hours of sleep a night). This went on for a few months but things improved each week and I healed.Stupid me went on Klonopin again in Nov 2013. I was on it for four months. Crossed over to Valium and did a six week taper. I am one year off and still suffering terribly!!!I have total insomnia for a year now (no sleep-zero for days at a time unless I take Benadryl to get a few hours)_ severe emotional blunting: can't cry or feel love for my children_ muscle twitching_ head pressure_ and burning skin. This withdrawal has rendered me almost non functional.Benzos are poison!!! Never ever take them. If you need something for anxiety_ try Valerian root. If you need a prescription_ try Vistaril. But never use benzos. This has destroyed my life and my family.,F,48,4  months.75 mg,4/8/2015,Klonopin

55, 5, insomnia and fibromyalgia,No side effects except the benefits of the drug seemed to be somewhat fluctuating from nite to nite after many years and I had no desire to increase the dosage.,I slowly tapered off of my 2 mg dosage; it took 1-1/2 months of a wide variety of awful_ awful side effects. But I am strong enough that I persevered and I got completely off (everybody is different). Once I was completely off (for 2 months)_ my insomnia and fibromyalgia pain returned with a vengeance. I felt I was slowly dying from sleep deprivation_ and I'm sure that I was. I could not rely on soma (which doesn't do much if taken daily) and other weaker sleep medications. It was soon clear that I had to go back on Klonopin and take it until my dying day. Klonopin is literally a life saver for me!,F,65, 2 mg 1X D,3/30/2015EmailHistory,Klonopin

57, 3, Anxiety,I've felt more sad since I started taking this dose (2 days ago). At times I feel like crying_ for no reason. It's feels like I'm switching my anxiety for sadness.,This has worked for my severe anxiety_ but since raising the dose 2 days ago_ I notice I'm much more sad. I hope this passes.,F,31,2  days0.5 mg 3X D,2/11/2015Email,Klonopin

59, 1, my husband was taking it,At first he was OK. He has always been a sweet loving person however he takes too many of them and it makes them very aggressive_ loud_ angry and yells at me in front of our son it has been a complete hell for us every time he gets it.,I wish the doctor would have never introduced them to it because it is breaking up our marriage. I dread when he gets them every month.,F,,8  months30,2/6/2015,Klonopin
