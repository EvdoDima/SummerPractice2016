0, 1, For Hayfever,After the initial spray there was burning sensation. After 5 minutes when I was expecting relief; my nose appeared more blocked which then resulted in making my breathing worse. I also experienced periods of dizziness and a dry cough and the day after a sore throat,I normally use a Optirex a nasal spray for hayfever I think the concentration may be higher in Optirex although the product is actually cheaper. It gives more or less instant results that last for me personally for about 10 hours the only downside is it can sometimes give you a weird taste down the back of your throat however this is momentarily and often goes after a minute or so,F,25,1  days,7/31/2016,Beconase

3, 1, Nasal dripping,This medication caused me severe anxiety_ irritability and symptoms of psychosis.,I used it as directed_ but would not ever use it again.,,47,2  months50mcg,2/2/2016,Beconase
4, 1, sinusitis,Irritable_ angry_ agitated_ palpitations_ anxious,Would not recommend this_ have suffered with sinus trouble for years but recently taken beconase I find I have no patient and the smallest thing annoys me. Will not be taking it again.,F,33,4  days50mcg,3/2/2015,Beconase
5, 1, post nasal drip back throat,On the second day when I took the first dose_ (twice daily) 50mcg 180 controlled doses the sensation was extremely strong in my left sinus and I became dizzy_ my heart beHan to race and the room went black. After lying for a while I wondered if I should call 999. I made it to my pharmacy 20 minutes later but was still shaking uncontrolably for help where they said that this medication is safe and that sometimes it might be a little peppery. It's been 6 hours and I'm still feeling unwell especially on the left side of my head and neck.,,F,45,2  days,12/10/2014Email,Beconase
6, 3, i was addicted to sinex,I couldn't lose weight and did not put two and two together! I eat healthy and gluten free_ so i looked up steroid use and this is only answer! Does help blocked nose though and drip.,,F,32,2  months2 sprays,7/5/2014Email,Beconase
7, 1, Trouble breathing through nose,Anxiety_ irritable_ anger_ mood swings. Nose felt a lot better but the cost is too high,I tried this spray a few years ago and stopped as I didn't feel right. My GP assured it couldn't be this. This time with me_ I know I have a problem with it. The leaflet didn't mention these possible effects - its only after digging I realised the issue. On a plus side_ my nose did feel a lot better_ but I am not using it again!,M,42,21  days 2X D,7/8/2013,Beconase
8, 4, Year round allergies,Nosebleeds,Definately helped my post nasal drip_ I was experiencing thick clots of green phlegm_ especially from back of throat.  I have had a dry throat and nosebleeds using it_ but nothing I can't handle.  Dosage was 2 pumps each nostril twice a day_  then reduce to 1 pump each nostril once allergy was under control.  I can't comment on the anxiety comments_ I can't imagine that such a small dosage could affect you like that.  I haven't had a cold since October 2012_ so I can't comment on the immune response either.,F,43,1  years 2X D,4/12/2013Email,Beconase
9, 1, rhinitis,Unexplained anger_ irritability_ anxiety_ blisters in nose_,I am not usually the sort of person to fly into a rage but the slightest thing makes me angry_ I am raging at my family and they are suffering due to my extreme mood swings. This site and patients comments have shown me that the medication is causing the problems as I have so many of the same symptoms as other people who have rated this drug on this site. I will no longer be using this nasal spray.,F,78,9  weeks50mg 2X D,12/20/2011,Beconase
10, 1, Allergic Rhinitis,Inability to deal with even low level stress. Panic attacks_ general anxiety_ insomnia_ immune system down.,"Was put on beconase aged 11 as the then latest ""miracle cure' for allergies. 2 doses a day and told to take it for life. No-one monitered my condition. Developed above symptoms after aproximately one years use. No-one really took much notice as it was put down to ""teenage neurosis"" (even though it got worse with time_ not better) and just a poorly functioning immune system in teenage and adult years. Not long ago_ a doctor friend of mine found out about this and was horrified - result gradually reduced dosage and stopped using it. Apparently adrenal gland damage is possible and also irreversable. Would recommend the monitering of anyone on this_ as people react differently to medication. It did help the allergy_ but given the choice_ I would rather have stayed on antihistamines.",F,47,31  years 2X D,9/8/2011Email,Beconase

12, 4, Hayfever,My tendons all over my body are getting inflamed at the slightest work/lifting.,I am getting weak tendons all over my body - legs_ arms_ hands_ feet. Had cortizone steroid injections in my thumbs for 'Trigger Thumb' (damaged tendons) but the consultant said next time it would be an operation as too much steroid weakens tendons. That made me wonder because I've taken Beconase for at least 15 years (only spring and summer) and it did cure my severe hayfever_ but at what cost if it's messed up my tendons and I can no longer work? Has anyone else had similar experience or is there no connection?,M,41,15  years,9/16/2009,Beconase
13, 5, Hayfever,None,I was a sneezy_ itchy_ runny mess for years_ relying on the old-fashioned antihistamines for relief nearly every day_ until I found Beconase.  I pump once in each nostril each morning - voila!  That's it.  No more allergies.  Very safe_ very effective.  I have been using Beconase for about 18 years.,F,52,18  years,6/25/2009,Beconase
14, 1, asthma,insomnia,I went on and off this drug several times over about a 1 1/2 year period. It has a 100% correlation with insomnia. My doctor claimed it could not possibly cause insomnia and that it is safe enough to give to children. Based upon my experience_ I consider giving it to children as child abuse.,F,55,18  months,11/26/2008,Beconase

17, 4, Hayfever,Headaches_ extreme anxiety_ agitation_ indecision_ confusionand unable to focus on things. Also a 'hyper' feeling.,beconase did help my hayfever_ but I went through a very bad spell recently with the above symptoms. I reasoned Beconase was to blame_ and stopped using it. I already feel less anxious. I have spoken to my doctor who says he has not heard of this phenomenon. I then discovered this site when looking for more information. This confirms my thought that Beconase is capable of causing *serious* problems.,M,35, ,6/2/2006,Beconase
18, 4, Allergy,I do not feel it has any of the effects mentioned by the other people talking about the drug here. It makes me breath and it's price is right compared to similar drugs. I try to stop taking it and then find my self unable to breath or sneezing my head off,,M,46,4  years,12/11/2005,Beconase
19, 3, Rhinitis,I found myself getting agitated_ angry for no reason.  Then I remembered that Beconase has steroids in it so I went on web to check side effects which match my symptoms.  i am normally on non reactive_ calm_ easy going person and i am behaving like a stressed person.  Stopping Beconas immediately.,They should make people aware of these symptoms.,F,41,7  days,4/11/2005,Beconase

22, 1, allergies,"Insomnia_ agitation_ anxiety.  I felt angry and hostile for no reason.  Did not realize it was the medication until it happened on several occasions.  Several doctors have assured me it is ""not systemically absorbed_ there is no way it would do this with such a small amount of steroid""_ etc. etc.",The toxicologists I have consulted have explained to me that there is no more efficient method of getting a substance into one's system_ and that is in fact quite possible.  This type reaction to steroids is considered quite common_ but the drug literature for these nasal sprays does not acknowledge it.,F,42,3  days,4/19/2002,Beconase
