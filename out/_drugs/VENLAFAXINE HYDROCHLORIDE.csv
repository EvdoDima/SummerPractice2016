0, 1, depression,All the usual.  Impossible to stop without terrible  side effects. Would  never recommend taking it. Worst nightmares I've ever had_  continuing off and on over the 5 years. I have to change to something else.  I have given this drug a fair trial!!,Dr's should tell you that you can get this side effect.,F,,5  years75mg 1X D,7/5/2015,Venlafaxine hydrochloride
1, 4, depression,took a while to adjust_ maybe 3-4 months before my sex drive returned and started feeling feelings again. I plateaued twice which is how i ended up on such a high dose. I have been stable on 300mg for 6 or more years. only remaining side effects are poor heat tolerance/sweating and  urinary hesitancy_ which is worth it for staying out of major depressive cycle,Got dx with ADHD at age 23 and the addition of stimulant (adderall) to antidepressant was a life changer. I am happy with this medication and have no plans to go off. The biggest issue is a missed dose aka withdrawal. Probably not so bad on a low dose but absolute hell for me: nightmares_ dizzy_ zombified x1000,F,28,9  years150 2X D,8/1/2014,Venlafaxine hydrochloride
2, 4, depression_ anxiety,Before starting I was having severe depression & bad mood swings. Went off on ppl a lot in a rage. Couldn't stand myself. Now taking it for 3 mo. And feel a lot better insteadof fflipping out on ppl I can just walk away and let it go before I would be in a rage for hours/days. My worry level has dropped. This med really helped me. I've tried a bunch and this was the one that helped me. Good luck,,F,45,3  months150 er,4/16/2014Email,Venlafaxine hydrochloride

4, 4, Depressive anxiety,I've been taking the generic (Venlafaxine EG) and it has helped allright to overcome my anxiety disorder. To be noted that the withdrawal effects are quite severe: I once forgot to take it with me for a week away and I had constant nightmares and strong dizziness during the day. Even with a long and careful phasing out (from 150 to 75 mg_ and then to 37_5 mg)_ after I finally stopped taking it  I had occasional nightmares for ten days.,,M,53,18  months37_5-150mg 1X D,2/3/2013,Venlafaxine hydrochloride

6, 2, Anxiety & Panic Attacks,Daily headaches and severe stomach pains,I switched to the generic to save some $$$ but quickly found out after almost 2 weeks that I have been having daily headaches and severe stomach pains.  I can only conclude that it is from switching to generic.  I will go back to the brand name when this script runs out and see if that cures my problem.,M,30,2  weeks75 1X D,8/30/2010,Venlafaxine hydrochloride
