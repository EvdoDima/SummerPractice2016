0, 1, bladder infection,This medicine IS A NIGHTMARE.  Taking it for a UTI.  It made me anxious_ woozy_ restless_ I had a headache_ was confused and forgetful_ had palpitations_ dry throat...I was both tired yet anxious and felt like I could simultaneously take a nap and rip someone's head off.  I was taking it on an empty stomach 3x then talked to my dr. yesterday and she changed it to 2x with meals.  Some side effects went away BUT THE ANXIETY AND AGGRESSION ARE STILL PRESENT AND IT'S MAKING ME TYPE IN ALL CAPS.,,F,48,3  days500 3X D,5/12/2016Email,Ampicillin trihydrate
