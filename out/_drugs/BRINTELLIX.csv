1, 5, MDD_ Anxiety_ Agorophobia_ have chi,Nausea,First antidepressant inmy life that actually WORKS!! I WANT TO GET UP_ DO THINGS.No jitters. Work through the nausea- eat a few peanut butter crackers or saltines_ then take pill_then sit UP. Will only last for a little while. Set aside time to be still. If you lay down right away you will vomit. If you take at bedtime_ once the nausea calms down_lady on or tilt toward your left side especially if you have GERD issues. At 5mg you may see minimal effects. Once you start to increase toward 10mg you should start feeling better. Please get Zofran for the nausea from your doctor if you need it. It keeps you from vomiting.I almost quit in the beginning due to it but I found that the crackers and only a few shops of water worked. Always check all medication interactions with amedication interaction checker online_especially if you use multiple pharmacies. Hang in there. This medication is a miracle for me. Taper up slowly per month if you need to.,F,36,3  months10 mg,8/12/2016Email,Brintellix
2, 3, depression,Itching_ drowsiness_ rapid weight gain_ clouded mind_ memory loss,I will say it worked fantastic at first.

3, 4, depression and anxiety,I have felt great on this medication.  My weight has remained constant and my bowel movements are regular.  Some nights_ I still have problems sleeping_ and nap during the day  I think I will try to take the medication at night.  I have had some serious loss of equilibrium (not vertigo)_ and I have fallen down 4 times.To date_ these episodes have not been associated with the brintellix by my psychiatrist or specialists I have seen for the problem.  I have even had an MRI and MRA_ and now how an appointment with a neurologist.  I am starting to think that the brinitellix may be associated with the loss of equilibrium.  I intent to discuss with my psychiatrist again.  But I would hate to stop taking this drug_ as it has really helped by depression.  I have more desire to engage in life_ and I am much more social.,,,62,1  years10 mg 1X D,8/1/2016Email,Brintellix

22, 4, PTSD_ MDD_ PANIC ATTACKS_ GAD,I tried this med last year but due to extreme constipation switched. Back on it now because other than constipation it's the best I have ever tried. Since I was on 40mg Prozac 2 weeks ago and could not wean before starting brintellix I am only on 5mg right now. Prozac can take several weeks to leave the body and increase brintellix effects by 2 times. When I try to increase my dosage right now I have symptoms of serotonin syndrome for about 1 hour (heart racing_ sweating_ shaking_ shivering_ anxiety_ nausea)_ so I am waiting another week to increase to maybe 7.5. Cutting the pills is difficult (shape)_ but it can be done. First few days I experienced a metal taste in my mouth_ feeling of warmness_ and a little bit of jitters about 1 hour after taking it. Only lasted 5 to 10 minutes. Now  I have night sweats_ feel little motivation_ and sleepy_ but it has helped with my anxiety a lot. Anxiety feels physical so I don't freak out. Last time I was on 10mg I felt pretty good all around. Feel more logical and in charge of my life_ less emotional and out of control. I'm expecting to feel better as I will slowly increase to 10mg over the next few weeks. Do not recommend transitioning from Prozac because of long half life and increase of brintellix plasma makes transitioning extremely difficult.,Other side effects right now are sometimes upset stomach_ soft stools_ little moodiness.,F,46,2  weeks5mg,6/3/2016Email,Brintellix

26, 4, MDD(major depressive disorder),Anxiousness_ I have to take sleeping pills to sleep otherwise id be up all night restless.,This medicine is GREAT for major extreme depression_ like I can't move or get out of bed depression.

Brintellix is the boss over any ssri out there.,M,24,4  weeks10,5/17/2016,Brintellix
27, 2, Depression,Strange neurological symptoms,I had heard great things about Brintellix so I was excited to try it and was extremely disappointed when I had an adverse reaction. My face went numb_ lips tingly_ I was slurring my words_ and my whole body was twitching. It was some kind of strange migraine/seizure-like neurological thing so I had to stop taking the med. Luckily none of the bad effects lingered after the Brintellix was out of my system.,F,22,3  days5 mg,5/17/2016,Brintellix
28, 5, Depression/Anxiety/Toxicomania,Visual hallucinations_ nausea_ morning insomnia (wake up at 5 am but refreshed)_ dizziness_ irritability. Side effects are mild and subsides after 1 week. Better tolerance_ than with tricyclics and SSRIs/SSNRIs.,Brintellix is a serotonin modulator and stimulator that has a different mode of action and also stimulates norepinephrine and ace?tylcholine release in the brain. I was a methamphetamine drug addict_ and I tried all the antidepressants available including tricyclics. Anafranil was excellent but I had some annoying side effects. Since I take Brintellix_ the brain fog disappeared and I have more energy_ more motivation_ a better quality of life and I don't suffer from social anxiety anymore. My quality of sleep is better. I didn't gain any weight. I have a more concentration and it helps my ADHD. I use in combination with Vyvanse 40 mg_ Lamictal 100 mg and Wellbutrin SR 100 mg BID. People that didn't try for at least 4 to 8 weeks shouldn't put ratings on drugs.,M,37,2  weeks10 1X D,5/16/2016Email,Brintellix

31, 3, Major Depressive Disorder,First couple of days on this medication I was knocked on my butt.  Very fuzzy_ tired and dizzy.  I definitely experience nausea on this medication but nothing I cannot handle by now.  If I do not eat with it_ that's when I experience most of the nausea.  Also_ if I do not eat with it I will experience diarrhea.I have a great doc who put me on the brat diet until the symptoms were tolerable.  Organic apple juice_ toast_ rice_ crackers and light chicken soups.  Other than that_ I have not had anything bothersome other than insomnia which I take benedryl to help relieve.,I'm very sensitive when it comes to medication.  So instead of switching me_ my doctor helped me work my way through the  side effects.  10 mg pulled me out of a depressed fog.  I suspect I'll end up on 20 mg for full relief.  No high blood pressure_ no weight gain_ no food cravings....it's worth a shot if you can get through the first few weeks.,F,36,3  weeks10 mg,5/11/2016,Brintellix
32, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Decreased sex drive (as with all antidepressants I've taken),Brintellix cured me of MDD. I have been on antidepressants for 7 years and this is the only medication that helped me. I was on Celexa_ Zoloft_ and Effexor before I took this and the previous medications all failed. I took Brintellix for 2 years and I'm now in my final days of weaning off the medication.,F,25,2  years10mg 1X D,5/4/2016,Brintellix

My main problem is anxiety. This drug did nothing for me. It made me feel flat. Did not improve my mood at all in fact it made me emotionless and depressed. **IMPORTANT** - Just because it did not help me does not mean it won't be your ""wonder drug"".

36, 1, depression,Horrible dizziness and nausea,Heard such good things_ had hoped this would help me. I've been pn paxil 2 years_ hate it and need to get off it_ but weaning without side effects was hard_ and this drug just made those worse.,F,31,2  weeks10mg,4/4/2016,Brintellix
37, 3, Major Depressive Disorder,Dizziness_ headache_ gas,I am switching to Brintellix from Paxil as the Paxil has seemed to run its course in helping my depression.  Doctor said she's seen good things with this med and thinks it will be good for me.  The first couple of days were fine.  Yesterday and today I have alot of dizziness and headaches.  When I move my head_ it feels like my brain has to physically catch up.  Have to work hard to absorb information or listen right now.  We stopped the Paxil cold turkey and started with the 10 mg of this hoping that would ease some of the withdrawal symptoms.  Not sure if this weird thing I'm having is withdrawal from the old med or side effect of this new one.  I knew Paxil is hard to withdrawal from_ but I'm going to hang in there with this one and hopefully this feeling gets better.  Super gassy-I know that's the Brintellix.  No itching yet.  Lots of racing thoughts_ but that's my norm anyways.  Slept fine last night_ but took 1/2 an Ambien before bed.,F,46,4  days10 MG 1X D,3/28/2016Email,Brintellix

As soon as I started the 10mg dose I was able to feel an improvement in my thought processes.  Prior to Brintellix_ I had been constantly obsessing with anxiety and depressed_ feeling hopeless and that I was just hear to wait until death took me.  A week after the 10 mg/day dose_ I was able to think about my day and things that I needed to do.  No more obsessing.  And_ I am able to make life meaningful with just my day to day activities again.  Before it was work and come home.  Now_ it's work_ come home and find meaningful things to do!,F,58,21  days10mg 1X D,2/29/2016,Brintellix
43, 4, Major Depression_PTSD_ anxiety,So far I have only experienced little red spots appearing all over my skin. I have had a bit of insomnia but then again I always do. My anxiety is a bit higher but not unbearable. I am concerned about the red spots because this is what happened to me when I took Paxil. It turned into extreme itching after the spots appeared.,I haven't had any of the nausea that people complain about so far. I have taken it on an empty stomach and with food. The amazing thing about it so far is that it has already stopped my constant thoughts of suicide. I haven't been crying all the time or had mood swings. I am concerned about the people who said that they gained weight with this drug. I know it is supposed to be weight neutral. I am already over-weight from taking in the past Depakote_ Zyprexa_ Remeron and other drugs that make you gain weight. Right now I am only taking Brintellix_ Xanax and Trazadone. I just read that someone said it wasn't good to take Trazadone and Brintellix together.  I am supposed to stay on the dose I'm on for 2 weeks and then bump it up to 10mg. If the spots turn into itching I will have to discontinue this drug I guess. I also read about the short term memory loss. That worries me as I already have that from taking various different Benzos for years. I know what they do to my memory.,F,54,4  days5 mg. 1X D,2/18/2016,Brintellix

Decreased sex drive.(Never had side effects with any other SSRI),I've never had side effects with other antidepressants. This one has also caused decreased sex drive. It was 6 weeks before I had relief from my depression. While not as tearful as before the therapeutic dose_ I feel blah and lacking emotion such as laughter.

48, 2, Depression,nausea_ flatulence_ lethargy,I have treatment resistant depression. Have tried many meds and always have a horrible reaction and no benefits. I started Brintellix on 5mg_ in case of bad reaction. Took that for 2 weeks_ then upped to 10mg for 2 weeks_ then 15mg for 3 weeks. My depression did not lessen. In fact_ I possibly felt worse. However_ I did stop crying daily_ but was probably just too numbed out. I didn't actually feel any better_ had no energy_ and just sat on the couch all the time. I did have nausea daily but I have a pretty iron stomach so no vomiting. After nearly two months_ I gave up on the med. Within 2 weeks of stopping_ I gained 7 lbs. I had been the same weight for over a year and suddenly was rapidly gaining weight. Aside from lethargy and moderate nausea_ I really had no noticeable side effects.

51, 1, Depression/anxiety,I've been taking 60mg of Cymbalta with success for 9 years. Until the last 3 months I've experienced severe depression which may be due to becoming perimenopausal but regardless my doctor switched me from 60mg Cymbalta to 10mg of Brintellix without tapering. Felt manic_ had great energy but agitation_ anxiety and intense irritability within 2 days. In short_ I felt terrible. Doctor changed me back to cymbalta at 120mg which I've been on for exactly a month now but I'm in severe depression still. Started birth control to see if hormones will help and looking into a Novasure procedure to see if that makes a difference. I've was diagnosed with depression 30 years ago and have taken Effexor_ Zoloft_ Wellbutrin_ Serzone_ abilify_ at multiple long-term periods in my life.

52, 1, Depression_ anxiety,Started at 5mg and had mild nausea and sleeplessness but did experience some improvement in depressive symptoms and anxiety. Even noticed improved cognitive functioning and concentration. But that all changed after 2 weeks when massive even worse anxiety and depression ensued. Became completely obsessive about every little thing and brain was racing with random negative thoughts. Would awake every night after 4 hours sleep with mind racing so badly sleep was impossible. Developed a severe pressure headache and fogged out disassociated feeling as well as noticeable problems with memory recall and even slurred speech. Went straight to Dr after finishing 1 month supply of pills and was told to stop immediately and was placed on Prozac which produced immediate improvements.,Obviously this drug works for some but not for others -- everyone has different body chemistry and genetic make-up -- but for me this drug_ after early promise_ proved to be a 2 week psychotic roller coaster ride that made me far worse mentally. Hope and perseverance are not reliable methods to address severe symptoms. If it's not working for you talk to your doctor fast. There are other options.,M,53,1  months5mg,12/31/2015,Brintellix

55, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Itchiness,I was having days I couldn't even get out of bed_ eat_ or do anything for myself that's how bad my depression was. I've been on over 40 different psych drugs in hopes of reducing my depression. This is the ONLY drug I've taken that didn't give me sexual side effects_ or any other bad reaction. Within two week I started noticing a slights change for the better and now after a month in feeling amazing even at the lowest dose. Give it some time and realize the therapeutic dose is ideally 15-20mg a day. So_ if you don't notice much in the beginning its because you're probably not on the right dose for you. I HIGHLY recommend this med. It even helps me focus.,M,24,1  months5mg,12/26/2015,Brintellix

57, 3, Depression Anxiety,itching_ extreme dizziness_ weird feeling over all_ hyper active_ trouble concentrating,I was on Zoloft for 10+ years_ it worked very well for me_ but like any SSRI it began to lose it's potency. Dr. suggested this med and I felt it helped a little with anxiety_ but gave me more weird feelings of dizziness_ depression_ feelings of doom etc. Then the hyperactive spells came and I hated that_ still on it right now_ thinking of switching else.,M,39,60  days10 1X D,12/12/2015,Brintellix
58, 3, Depression resistance to other trea,It seems to help with my depression but also seems to be aggravating anxiety and trouble sleeping.  Nausea is terrible but lessening with time.  It is better if taken with food.  Although it seems to make me extremely tired feeling_ when I lay down to sleep_ my mind is racing and I can't sleep.  Only sleep short amounts even with xanax.  I have been on xanax/kloni for years.  Have never had trouble sleeping with the xanax before.   I am going to try changing up the time that I take it and see if that helps.  I am also going to try to continue it and see if the sleep/anxiety thing is maybe another side effect that may reside with time.,,F,35,1  months5-10,12/9/2015Email,Brintellix
59, 3, depression,My head gets very itchy.  keep scratching my head. sometimes have to take Benadryl for it.  was keeping me awake but switched to morning which is better.  If i eat with food dont get nauseaus.  my memory is fabulous on Brintellix.  so smart. remember things from childhood.  Trying to figure out if there is weight gain just upped it,I dont feel it helps me depression as much as Prozac did.  I would like to combine them but my dr wont let me. Just upped to 20 to see if that helps with obsessive thoughts.  dont know yet,F,55,9  months,12/6/2015Email,Brintellix
