0, 1, ,Horrible gas pains_ bloating_ cramps_ anxiety_ insomnia_ and intense abdominal pain and distention.,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG unless there is NOTHING else that will work.  I took it as an adjunct to Cipro for diverticulitis_ and I have never had a more miserable 36 hours.  Spent a sleepless night with abdominal pain_ gas_ distention_ and horrible bloating_ and had to go to the emergency room the next day for treatment antibiotic-caused colitis_ courtesy of Clindamycin.  I still feel fragile.  This is a terrible drug_,F,57,1  days300 3X D,7/8/2012Email,Clindagel
1, 5, to get rid of the tiny bumps on my,slight numbness every so often of my face...not as bad as it sounds,LOVE IT! In 26 years I have NEVER had clear skin. It took me a month after being given the rx to actually fill and take it because everything else they gave me made my acne worse.  I don't like/trust my derm so i was lear ( have since stopped going). this lotion is the best thing I got out of going there so long!,F,26,6  months,7/8/2009,Clindagel
2, 5, Acne,Every once in a while I thought my face felt a tiny bit numb...but other then that NO SIDE EFFECTS :),I love this medicine. I was leary at first and didn't want to waste the money on filling this RX since every other RX that the doc gave me made my acne 100x worse! I was sick of having nodules on my face! I was going to try Accutain_ but I didnt like the NEVER ENDING list of HORRID side effects.  Within two days I noticed a difference in my skin with Clindamycin.  Everything from no pimples to the little annoying bumps going away. LOVE_ LOVE_ LOVE THIS MEDICINE! :),F,26,15  days,11/5/2008Email,Clindagel
