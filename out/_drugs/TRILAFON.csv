0, 5, Psychosis and agitation. Bipolar,to get used to it the first time I had extremely rigid and painful muscles_ walked around like a zombie. I then I experienced tremors in certain places that was fixed by an anticholinergic such as cogentin_ but that does not work for me. I take artane and I still have a bit of a quiver in my chin/lower lip. However_ I have not had to be hospitalized in almost four years and that for me is an extreme accomplishment.,Taken off and on since I was 17_ only taken off due to multiple doctors trying to put me on the new popular med at the time I had illogical and racing thoughts_ bursts of anger and extreme paranoia. I had a psychotic break in high school my senior year.  I am almost 40 and it always worked for me but they took me off it in a hospital and I have tried every antipsychotic and this is the only one that worked with sustained use.,F,39, 8 w/4 prn 2X D,3/6/2016,Trilafon
1, 5, severe postpartum and confusion,No side effects at all.This drug saved my life. I improved after 2 doses. Had about 5lb weight gain.,I hope they always make it. The newer drugs are scary.)/,F,58,8  years4mg x 3 da,1/2/2015,Trilafon
2, 1, told doctor i might be depressed,anxiety restlessnessthought my head would explode when i cold turkeyed peratsin only after few days but survived and was ok afterwards. never cold turkey this thing fast or bad things can happen,,M,28,3  days8,1/14/2014,Trilafon
3, 5, Schizoaffective Disorder,None except some yawning an hour after taking.,This is by far the best antipsychotic I've taken with the fewest side effects too.  It helps with thinking straight_ being unafraid of people_ sleeping at night when I need to_ and it even has increased my libido.  Overall I've become much more functional than when I took any of the so-called atypical antipsychotics_ including the revered Clozaril.  I only tried this older medication after trying all the newer ones over the course of ten years_ and supposedly having no other choice.  It's a shame I wasn't tried on this first.  It would have saved me years of agony and excess body weight (I'm losing all my Zyprexa weight now while I've been taking Trilafon).  Just remember that just because it works so well for me_ it doesn't mean it will for you.  Everyone reacts differently.,M,39,1  years24 mg 1X D,9/20/2011,Trilafon
4, 1, psychiatrist didn't like me,Akathesia. This drug is pure poison. NEVER voluntary use it. ,If you have used it for 1-2 days STOP IT IMMEDIATELY. I did and I survived (28 years old) although I it was terrible. I used seroquel to help with sleeping thought.If you have used it for longer periods of time. I don't know. You maybe doomed. God bless your soul.,M,30,3  days8 MG 2X D,1/14/2011,Trilafon

I take it 3 x per day_ makes me tired_ but would rahter have that then scary anxiety . If I take it at bedtime gives me insomnia_ so takin git three X a day abd not at nightitme_ works better.

6, 2, Schizo affective disorder,nausea_ restlerssness sleeping problems_ nightmares_ vomiting_ dry mouth_ drowsiness rapid heart beat_ difficulty urinating_ problems breathing_ sor musles hurt real bad_ shaking body or hands during different parts of theday_ dizzy_ confused_ cannot focus,I take as my doctor prescribed_ but have problems one momment and better another. Feel like the world can do without me_ only friends and family seem to understand. others want me to kill myself and stole my profile pictures and posted them on the Software Problem and other Google groups. While I am not suicidal_ I am very sad adn am mocked and made fun of on most web sites. I try to keep my mental illness a secret_ but they know and follow me around the internet telling me to kill myself or that the world would be better off with out me. I even get phone calls asking for someone with a different name who does not live here and it happens during the day. It used to happen at 3AM a few years ago_ but why are they doing this?I guess I don't belong here_ tried to stop thinking about it_ tried to forget_ but medicine brings those bad memories back.My crime they say_ is that I exist and that is reason enough to hate me and why they want me dead. But I will survive this and be with my friends and family as long as I can. Even if I am suffering and in pain a lot with a sore neck_ back_ and head. I've had my head hit many times in my life and recently bumped it on a wooden TV stand trying to get a computer part that fell back there.Even my own son disrepected me_ my father died his grandfather_ and I try Love and Logic and be a good father_ but he keeps doing these things to me and he knows they get on my nerves. I love him_ but if he keeps it up somehow the stress reacts,M,42,60  days12 1X D,10/3/2010,Trilafon
7, 2, Psychotic episode,Cognitive slowing_ major confusion_ painful muscle spasms_ feeling sick and zombielike_ made me too disorganized to read,Some people love it. It does have a lot of good about it_ but I would never consider taking it again. Ever.,F,17,2  months24mg 1X D,8/30/2010,Trilafon
8, 5, Paranoid Schizophrenia,Rapid/Pounding Heart Beat_ Palpitations_ Muscle Cramps,I have had hardly any side effects from this medicine_ and I feel really good on it. It doesn't increase my appetite like some other antipsychotics.,F,22,2  weeks,12/20/2009,Trilafon
9, 1, some sort of psychotic disorder,Severe depression leading to intense suicidal ideation,Normally I can sometimes THINK about suicide_ but Trilafon made me so depressed that I started OBSESSING about it. It got so far that I made exact plans_ before I decided to seek help before it was too late.,M,34,1  days,7/14/2009,Trilafon
10, 3, Bipolar II,Dry mouth_ muscles aching_ sore throat_ draining sinus_ forget short term memory (most of these went away until I upped the medicine)_ sometime but not alway_ wake up early ie 4:00 am increase oragms?,I just increase from 12 to 16. The side effects aren't horrible but annoying. Most of them went away at 12 but came back when I went to 16. Perphenazine has made be ok better_ I still have some have my moment. Perphenazine did make them less and not as bad as normal. I am really hoping this works because I think I have been on most everything and either it didn't work or side effects that I could not live with. This is an older drug and there is a small chance of getting Parkinson. My Dr. told me to take 800mg of vitamin E.,F,39,1  months,7/21/2006Email,Trilafon
