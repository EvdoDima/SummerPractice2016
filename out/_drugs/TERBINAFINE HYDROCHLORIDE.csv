0, 4, Toenail fungus (5 toenails),Taste disturbance (lasted a few hours then went away). Rash for a few days then went away. Loss of appetite. Body Aches every now and then. Vivid dreams (which I appreciate). Extreme Fatigue most days.,Will continue treatment despite all the negative side effects since the fungus was spreading to all of my toenails and I have a swimming pool so I want to be able exposed my feet without feeling embarrassed. If I get cured then it will all be totally worth it! (45 days into treatment and clean clear nails are growing!),F,26,45  days250mg 1X D,8/13/2012,Terbinafine hydrochloride
1, 4, Toenail fungus,Slight loss of taste.Slight hair loss.,Started taking 3 months ago. Toenail fungus of 16 years improving dramatically for 1st time. (Tried all alternatives without success)Went on sugar free/ gluten free diet_ no alcohol. I believe this minimised impact on liver_ and thus side effects.Terbinafine is toxic_ but so is a fungus_ often found systemically if on toenails. Lifestyle change stops re-occurrance_ but needed terbinafine initially.,M,49,3  months250 1X D,8/22/2010,Terbinafine hydrochloride
