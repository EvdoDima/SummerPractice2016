0, 1, Insomnia,Suicidal thoughts and aggressive behavior.  I was fine taking this at first_ it definitely worked to put me to sleep_ however_ I would wake up in the middle of the night and have to take more.  I was prescribed the Zolpidem generic.,I did not tie in my suicidal ideation with the Ambien until yesterday_ and did my research and found that it was a common side effect. Previously_ I woke up in the morning and looked forward to the day.  For the past several weeks_ my thoughts have been primarily centered on how I can off myself.,F,55,1  years5 mg 1X D,7/25/2016Email,Ambien cr

3, 1, Sleep/nurse working nights,Wanted to kill myself while on this medicine. caused severe mood swings.  Caused severe depression long term and when I stopped taking it I felt normal again. I also drove on it after taking my dose before bed and don't remember driving. Scary stuff!!  It does work to promote sleep but these other side effects out weight a good night sleep I take melatonin 10 mg at bedtime and it works without any side effects. Please don't get trapped and stay away from this dangerous medicine.,,F,41,3  years12.5,10/30/2015Email,Ambien cr

5, 1, insomnia,I had terrible head pain_ Occipital pain and they say it caused neuralgia. The pain got so severe_ I have a nerve block done in my high part of neck into my skull. I stop and went on Benadryl and that works fine for the insomnia. I also couldn't remember anything_ and ate like crazy in bed with no memory of it. It did knock me out but can't tolerate the head pain.,,F,53,2  months10mg 1X D,2/24/2015Email,Ambien cr
6, 1, insomnia,headache after waking up_ increase anxiety_ worse insomnia_ HORRID withdrawls_ builds tolerance quick (have to take more drug for same result),These are no safer than benzos like xanax and klonopin etc.  They are addictive and will mess up your natural sleep architecture.  Don't let any doc tell you that the z-drugs are safer than benzos because they are equally addictive and withdrawls are as bad or worse.  If your not sleeping find ways to destress your life and relax.  NEVER START ON SLEEP MEDS...,M,30,9  months12.5 3X D,8/30/2014,Ambien cr
7, 1, Insomnia,I tried 5mg (half a tablet) on the first night and did not sleep at all. I had a paradoxical reaction to it and had racing anxiety and irritability. I felt very irritable and anxious the next day.My GP advised me to take a full 10mg the next night. I had visual hallucinations (seeing everything in triple) and stayed awake the entire night_ with racing anxiety.I had an adverse reaction to this medication.I was not taking any other medications at the time.,This is called Stilnox in Australia.,F,39,2  days5mg 1X D,4/8/2014,Ambien cr
8, 1, Sleep,Hallucinations. At the time I was working nights. I came home ate breakfast took a Ambien Cr  took a shower before  going to bed . I started seeing people in the bathroom with me through the shower door . I would open the door and they would disappear . I got out of the shower and went to get some clean underclothes . The next thing I know my wife was waking me up asking what I was doing in her bed . The last thing I remember I was standing in front of the dresser. Needless to say I tossed the pills.  Another person I know took this ordered some stuff on line and didn't remember doing it.,,M,60,2  days1tablet 1X D,6/2/2013,Ambien cr
9, 4, Depression/anxiety unable to sleep,Memory loss is severe_ once I've taken tablet I cannot recall anything that happened after i took the table the next morning_ be it social media/phone calls etc. it is extremely disconcerting,Very vivid dreams_ can take a while to fully wake up,M,48,12  months12.5 1X D,2/25/2013Email,Ambien cr
10, 5, Insomnia,"No side effects_ excellent drug. I used to take Lunesta after two years I realized it stopped working. This seems to have worn off a bit but I have no ""zombie"" effect during the day the way I did with regular Ambien. I haven't tried to come off it so I can't say anything to that. My insomnia originally started almost 13 years ago and I got the best sleep with this medication.",,F,36,4  years12.5,5/24/2012,Ambien cr
11, 4, to help me sleep,I really have not had any severe side effects from this medication which is unusual for me.  I just thought that this medication was not working and then was put on another medication which was absolutely horrible and I never want to take another dose of Doxepin ever again!  If taken correctly under the guidance of a good doctor who knows what they are doing then they can and will help monitor your progress and if they are even concerned about their patients then they will take the time to listen very closely to what the patient is saying and then make the appropriate adjustment on the medication.  I also did not have the heavy hangover feeling the next day and after 8 hrs was ready to get up and did not feel heavy all over which was what I had on Doxepin.  This drug may not be perfect but it is so much better than suffering the other symptoms that I experienced on Doxepin and by the way this drug will never touch my lips again.,Basically I never have had any unusual side effects to this medication like night sweats_ swelling of the hands and ankles_ dry mouth or cravings for sweets all the time.  If a good doctor who really cares about their patients will listen to the patient and find out just how meds do affect them then they will know what can and cannot be given to the patient.  Because you yourself know your body better than anyone else and that even includes the physician.,F,52,6  months10 MG 1X D,12/7/2011,Ambien cr
12, 1, No longer taking it,hallucinations at night_ but good sleep.,the bad part of this drug is that I have fibromyalgia and I had an immediate increase in pain that I didn't connect to the drug until we did some online research.  I don't recall any problems for me of getting off of it_ but then_ I don't have problems w/an addictive personality either.  It does its job_ but the side affects aren't worth it.  I quit cold turkey,F,75,2  years 1X D,12/7/2011Email,Ambien cr
13, 1, Sleep issues obviously,This drug WILL knock you out. and you sleep a good 8 hours. but now try getting OFF the drug is where you have a problem. Causes Insomnia_ anxiety_ flu like symptoms_ agoraphobia_,RLS_ Headaches_ nausea_ diarrhea_ heart pounding and much more_ DO NOT EVER TAKE THIS DRUG! Can take up to 2 years!! 2 years to fully recover from taking this drug!! It is one of the worst things I have ever done with my life and regret ever taking one!!,F,39,5  years10 mg 1X D,10/31/2011Email,Ambien cr
14, 1, Insomnia,Memory loss,I agree with the other person who said this drug should be banned.  I was taking regular Ambien which helped me fall asleep_ but I'd still wake up in the middle of the night.  Prescribed this and I will say it worked_ big time!  However_ you do things and don't remember them while on this which is definitely unsafe.  Stopped taking it when I actually had intercourse with my husband and couldn't remember doing that.  Plus_ if I missed even one night of taking this I had horrible insomnia and would not get one bit of sleep.  I only took for about a month_ the risks just weren't worth it to me.  But will say if you want something that will help you fall asleep and are desperate_ this will work!,F,42,30  days 1X D,8/26/2011Email,Ambien cr

16, 4, Chronic Insomnia,I take with Seroquel 100mg and a muscle relaxer due to a spine disability I have; works well. Makes me a bit cranky and feeling a bit weird_ but pretty effective. Starts to stop working_ no matter what. I then switch to Lunesta.,,F,44,2  months12.5mg 1X D,7/18/2011Email,Ambien cr
17, 2, Insomnia caused by Bipolar Disorder,I found that it didn't help me to get to sleep as well as regular Ambien_ and that I had really bizarre dreams while on it. I was also waking up feeling extremely tired and disoriented.,Be careful in the morning when you wake up. You might still have some Ambien on board if you took it too late. I was in a car accident (minor fender bender) because when I wake up after taking Ambien CR I am out of it for awhile.,F,23,2  weeks12mg 1X D,4/30/2011Email,Ambien cr
18, 5, Insomnia,Drowsiness_ Agitation_ Memory Loss,I take this when I absolutley need to get a good nights sleep.  If you don't get in bed immediately after you take it_ you will get easily agitated (when spouse tells you to go to sleep) and forget things you do.  With that being said - take it then go straight to bed like you are supposed to.  I only take it as needed_ maybe once or twice a month so no need to worry about addiction.  No morning groggy feeling for me as long as I make sure I can sleep a full 8 hours.  Was a lifesaver for me when my mother died.,F,42,  1X D,2/14/2011,Ambien cr

20, 5, Inability to fall/stay asleep,Becoming very sleepy and out of it. That's what I wanted_ so those are good effects. If I try to stay up_ I will do strange things--send rambling emails_ eat another meal. No cooking or driving thank goodness.,This drug saved my sanity_ no doubt. Take it on an empty stomach for best results. Make sure you are ready for bed. You can feel it within 15 minutes. I sleep soundly_ for the first time in my entire memory.,F,43,3  years12.5mg 1X D,1/19/2011,Ambien cr
21, 2, insomnia,Helps to sleep but scary memory loss following days...and during 3 months that I took it off and on_ I was ridiculously hungry ...woke up from hunger....would eat and not remember.  Gained 30 lbs in 3 months and I have never had a weight problem before. It is coming off now that I am off of Ambien.,,F,38,3  months12.5 1X D,1/14/2011,Ambien cr
22, 1, ringing in ears making it hard to sleep,Horrid anxiety_ abdominal pain_ bladder pain_ diarrhea_ pain in my eyes_ head pain_ lethargy_ weird spacey feelings all day_ sleep deprivation because I couldn't sleep for more than 4-5 hours and did I mention anxiety? All of these went away when I quit taking ambien.,This drug should be banned. When I quit taking it_ I hardly slept for MONTHS! And the withdrawals were horrid. My doctor told me it would take six months or more to recover from the brain damage this drug does. This drug has made my life hell_ I wish I had never taken it.,M,51,18  weeks10 1X D,1/5/2011Email,Ambien cr

24, 5, Insomnia,Maybe a bit drowsy the next day but feel rested.,I had an awful time getting to sleep and the other drugs I tried either didn't work or only let me fall asleep for a short time.  I think the benefits of this drug are well worth it.,M,51,2  months12.5 MG 1X D,8/2/2010Email,Ambien cr
25, 5, insomnia,none  - some shock due to the cost of this drug!!! They need to come up with a generic for the long acting Ambien!,I take Ambien because I cannot fall asleep or stay asleep because of neuropathy - nerve damage - caused from several lumbar & cervical fusions as a result of a car accident. I also suffer from Fibromyalgia. If not for Ambien (and my faith in Jesus_ my Lord and Savior!!!)_ I would not get any sleep at all - I would just stare at the ceiling!,F,54,5  years12.5 1X D,5/21/2010,Ambien cr
