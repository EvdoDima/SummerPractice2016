1, 3, ED,Severe stomach pain_ shoulder pain_ and red face flushing,I usually take half a cialis pill 10mg)_ but as I  wasn't always able to achieve a full hard-on erection_ I decided this time to take the full 20mg pill.  By the following morning_ I surprisingly woke up with  a full erection_ and soon I had my wife screaming in pain because I  was so hard_ and probably also  she was so dry!! However the drawback to all this enjoyable climatic sexual success_ is that for the next three or four days_ I experienced severe stomach cramps_ sore shoulder pain_ and my face and cheeks broke out in redness!! I had this red face many times before_ and my doctor and specialist had never told me that it was all due to my taking of Cialis. In some ways_ I feel that Cialis is a very dangerous drug and that in most cases_ the pain and suffering caused immediately  afterwards is definitely not worth the 30 seconds of  pleasure derived.   ,M,66,5  days20 Mg,6/30/2016,Cialis

10, 1, BPH,UnGodly pain in buttock_ lower back_ thighs and even down to calves. Started to go to ER twice and did got to my Chiropractor for an adjustment_ couldn't sleep much for 2 days after the 3rd day I quit taking and I visited the Chiro that day_ after visiting my Chiro I felt better...good enough to resume the Cialis after skipping a day. About 5 hours those UnGodly pains came again and I ended up trying to sleep leaning agains a wall. Sitting was terrible_ lying down was worse and the only relief I got was standing or walking (though my legs at timer were weak). Finally searched the internet and found this site and another that clued me into the problem...CIALIS. Oxycodone and muscle relaxer didn't help finally got a little relief from Ibuprofen. Still some pain 2 days later...pray it will go away completely.,"I got so hard a cat couldn't scratch it but the ""pill from hell"" isn't worth it...I've got 86 pills I'm about to flush.

Most persistent side effect has been stuffy nose but this is not a big deal.,I originally went to the urologist because of Pyrones syndrome. While there I told him about my ED and he prescribed Cialis. Cialis has made our love life amazing. Erections last as long as it takes for me to orgasm. My wife probably orgasms 8 times out of 10. From research this may be partly due to the kink in my penis from the pyrones but persistent rogers give us both the confidence we were lacking previously.,M,70,4  years20mg 1X W,3/25/2016Email,Cialis

It is three weeks later and my vision is still blurred and eye is still burring. My doctor referred me to an optomologist who gave me an ointment for 7 days. He stated I have a swollen gland. The anti biotic ointment has not done anything.  I am super scared that I have suffered a perminent internal eye injury. For I still have sharp eye pain_ blurred vision_ and my eye has been tearing now for over 3 weeks. Not sure what to do next.,I feel that this is a very dangerous drug with big Pharma money behind it.  Please be careful when useing.  I think that the 5mg daily version is worse. There is something different about it.

36, 5, ED,Severe muscle aches of the upper back between the shoulder blade areas with mediocre lower neck/shoulder soreness. This began on day 5 at 3am.  I rolled my back muscles against an inside door frame to pseudo massage my back muscles gaining some relief and took an 800mg Ibuprofen (left over from an earlier shoulder surgery) that permitted me to sleep.  I repeated this on day 6 and 7 and also took some Ibuprofen at work which relieved the pain a bit. I did not associate this ache with Cialis until I saw a TV commercial on day 7... Bingo!  After seeing the commercial I also realized the connection to my between my abnormal irritability the last few days_ my loss of interest in walking in the morning_ in which I?ve been doing religiously for the past two months_ and increased minor knee and shoulder pain.  I had labrum shoulder reattachment surgery in February about 7 months ago; have had continuous subsiding pain since the surgery but it still exists; noticed an increase in pain on,At this point knowing what I do about Cialis_ and I feel my doctor should have clued me in_ but then maybe this was a conscious decision on his part not to; this will be determined on my Wednesday doctor visit_ I don?t have any issue continuing taking Cialis.  I will hydrate more as one suggested_ I will skip every other day until Wednesday?s doc visit. Check on a reduced rate such as 2.5mg. But honestly the benefits of having an erection far outweigh the realized negatives I?ve encountered. I say this with a clarifier being if I can get the symptoms under control.  The old adage_ No Pain? No Gain!  I?m 58 and in a two year period my erections have subsided from being softer to almost non-existent and loss of interest. When I was younger I used to say that if I ever lost my ability to get erect my life was over.  Well_ I got to this point and mentally it was alright with me but like an epiphany one morning I came to the realization that this was not who I am or ever was and decided to see an endocrinologist. Blood test is being reviewed and any treatment will be discussed this Wednesday. In the interim the doc gave me the Cialis to try. I?m alive!!! Erections are NO problem. I?m harder and thicker_ now I whisper sweetly to Big Mike? he immediately answers by standing at attention and presenting himself for action? I love my new volunteer army of one!

37, 1, BPH - Enlarged Prostate,Severe Lower Back Pain,Started an every-other day routine for a couple of weeks and felt stiff lower back. No betterment of urine flow.   Then start 5mg every day. Lower back pain became worse.  On 5th day of this daily dosage regiment my lower back pain became extreme_ debilitating_ and would not go away with Advil or Tylenol. Could not sleep/sit.  Pain was very deep and unrelenting. Almost went to hospital but then read this web-site and saw similar reactions. So I quit Cialis. Pain persisted for 24 hours more and then started subsiding_ but with periods of intensifying pain for 3 to 5 hours. Pretty frightening.  About 36 hours after stopping Cialis the back pains started going away permanently. Whew!  According to documentation from Cialis_ back pain problems occur in 1 to 3% of users.  I really doubt this.  Am I one of the few?  Anyway_ this drug is not for me!,M,69,7  days5 mg 1X D,9/4/2015,Cialis

39, 2, ED BPH,At first it was like I was a teenager again. Aroused of just the thought of sex. Got half hard just shaking it after a piss. Night time visits went from 4 times a night down to one. Harder erections than I have experienced in years. Wow_ my manhood was back full steam and I could again piss over a fence.  I was so excited.  Ouch_ after the eighth day I noticed extreme pains in the back of the upper leg. I thought it was due to outside work. Ibuprofen and Tylenol wouldn't touch the pain. I couldn't sleep at all and even resorted to trying the floor. I suspected this pain may have been from the cialis but until I started reading these reviews wasn't sure .  Another side affect I noticed was a period of irritability shortly after taking pill. Reminded me of when I drink too much caffeine.  I don't know what I am going to do because I really liked the positive effects it has on ED and BPH but the pain is almost unbearable .

44, 4, ED and BPH,I have been taking Cialis on and off for over a year.  I break a 20 mg tablet in half for a 10 mg dose.  I usually only take one or two doses a week.  Without a doubt it works as advertised for ED. I only experienced mild symptoms of headache and nasal stuffiness. Unfortunately_  I took 3 doses over 5 days last week and developed horrible side effects.   Extreme muscle pain in hips_ legs and upper back.  Severe neck pain and bilateral shoulder pain_ fatigue_ nausea_ and lethargy and headache.  It's been 4 days since I took last dose and symptoms are gradually improving.  Still have mild neck pain and nausea. Also experienced tinnitus.  I'm starting to think Cialis has been the cause of mild but persistent health problems this past year_ including body aches_ headaches and fatigue.  I hope these symptoms disappear soon.  ,Cialis is like any other drug...it has negative side-effects. It is not for everyone and should be taken carefully.  Dosage seems to be important with Cialis. Take the smallest dosage possible and closely gauge your symptoms. I do not plan on taking Cialis again.  The side effects are too scary and severe.   I've always been fairly healthy and fit_ but now I feel lousy and trepid.  I suspect the symptoms will dissipate over time_ but it will take a while.   I've had to take flexeril and extra strength Tylenol to mitigate the symptoms with limited success.  Be careful!,M,54,1  years20 mg,6/24/2015,Cialis

47, 4, BPH,cramps from hell,Had to stop after a week as cramps caused 2-3 hours lost sleep every night. Stopped 2 days and started 2.5mg for 3 weeks w/o cramps. Told my Dr. and they suggested 5mg every other day and the 2.5mg on the days I didn't take the 5 again w/o cramps. Then I went to the 5mg every day. Went from six trips per night to two.,M,57, 5mg 1X D,6/11/2015,Cialis
48, 4, To improve erections,Initially I had the full set: muscle pains_ dizziness_ blurred vision_ reflux etc. That was when I was taking up to 20 mg at a time. After a few months I started using 5 mg roughly every other day. I now have almost no side effects_ except occasional reflux if I eat too fast_ but still get all the benefits.,I have used both Cialis and generic equivalents (Apcalis_ Cynalis) and found all to be equally effective. Where I am at the moment I can only get 20 mg pills so I cut them into 4 (easier with generics). We make love 3 or 4 times a week so I take a 5mg pill 3 or 4 times a week. The fact that Cialis lasts for some time in the body means that I can still perform even though I have not taken a pill for 36 hours. My main recommendation to anyone thinking of using Cialis is to start with a week or so of daily 2.5 mg. Then_ depending on the effects (positive and negative) decide whether to continue_ to increase the dose or to stop completely. If you get positive effects but also negative side effects I recommend a bit of perseverance if they are tolerable - my side effects have lessened to almost nothing. I allow my pill to dissolve slowly under my tongue; whether that is a factor in reducing the side effects I don't know. Like others I also suggest that you cannot expect Cialis to compensate for years of failing to look after your body; if sex is important enough for you to take a drug it should be important enough to diet and exercise.,M,70,3  years5mg 4X W,5/13/2015Email,Cialis

While it offered an improvement to the symptoms of BPH_ it was not the 'cure' I had hoped for and some of the previous issues still existed. While the positive effects of the medication lasted for a few days_ the adverse side effects have completely discouraged me from continuing this treatment.,M,38,2  weeks20 1X W,5/4/2015,Cialis
53, 5, ED,None,This is a follow up to my post 04/16/2015.  Took a whole 20 mg tablet on a Friday around noon.  Was sure to drink several large glasses of water the remainder of the day and into the evening.  Before heading to bed after a late night out with moderate alcohol consumption (3 screwdrivers and 2 shots of Patron over 3+ hours) took 2 extra strength Ibuprofen.  One session that night and 2 the following morning with ZERO headache_ back pain_ shoulder pain.  Next day worked outside most of the day_ consumed 5 beers_ and several glasses of water during the day.  That night normal meal_ only one mixed drink_ followed by 2 very robust sessions.  Erections were again EXTREMELY hard for all sessions this weekend.  Wife was beside herself with joy.  Before falling asleep_ 2 more Ibuprofen_ and again NO headache_ flushing_ neck or back pain.  Another session in the morning_ followed by a day of traveling by car_ and pain was non-existent.Like another poster said_ take the pill EARLY in the day_ and stay hydrated.  This seems to be working well for me.  Will be moving to either 5 mg every other day or 2.5 mg daily in the near future.,M,53,2  months20 mg 1X AN,4/28/2015,Cialis
54, 3, ED,OMG. The worst lower back pain ever_ shoulder pain_ general muscle pains_ muscle fatigue_abdominal pain_ joint pain. Worse at night. Seen my doctor. Didn't link my symptoms to cialis at first. Had blood tests_ X-rays_mri_gastroscopy etc. all normal. Is is 20 days since last cialis and it is slowly improving. No idea how long it will take to completely clear up.,It works for ED_ without a doubt. I'm not complaining about the positive effects but will definitely NEVER touch them again.,M,4,2  years5 1X W,4/22/2015,Cialis
55, 5, ED,Pretty severe neck and upper back pain.  Very_ very mild flushing and stuffy nose.  Took two extra strength ibuprofen for the next two days_ this took care of the neck and back pain at night_ slept well.,"Was diagnosed with atrial flutter (NOT fibrillation) last year and meds compounded beginnings of ED.  Was capable of hard erections_ but was experiencing more ""non events"" than my wife or I was willing to accept.  Non smoker_ very light alcohol consumption.  Lost weight (30lbs) and more exercise helped_ but meds were taking their toll.  Was cleared for normal activity_ and doctor supplied trial pack of 20mg.  Took one whole pill friday afternoon_ and the party was on!!!  6 sessions from friday night to monday morning_ all with happy endings.  First 4 experienced EXTREME hardness_ wife commented about them.  Last two were well above average for me.  I have been experiencing spontaneous erections since monday morning_ something I haven't done in years.  As someone said_ stay hydrated and have ibuprofen ready for the muscle pain.  I will finish the trial pack_ and consider moving to the 2.5mg daily dose per my doctor.",M,,1  days20mg 1X D,4/16/2015,Cialis
56, 4, anxiety to fail/ new partner,Pain in the lower back for days? ..yep!! _ stuffy nose_ therefore hearing problems and mumbling voice for approx 30min after 3 - 4 hours of taking it. Cramps in legs?..yep!!,"It works..but not immediately..!! especially if your a big guy_or muscle guy (at least with me) Take at least 5-6 hours before combat:-)) Worked best as of next morning really. If a new girlfriend or woman the anxiety to fail doesn_t help  ""him"" either. Than viagra is better! Viagra puts teflon on the bullit_in 20 min_  if you know what I mean. But woman suspect something is fishy after you keep on going and going. So be an oscar winning actor..! You make me so horny..is not a good answer. Overdosing Does not help just to ""make sure"" like I did with 2x20 :-)) with cialis.  Makes no difference in the hardness or duration. Cialis overdose made me mumble I.e stuffy nose kinda mumbling.. So save that pill. If girl is helpfull and relaxed i.e french_  dutch_ swedish_ or other it helps_ if german beer""cooler"" and frostyer as the alps than good luck..All in all ...no pleasure without pain collegues.",M,50,1  days2x20mg,4/16/2015,Cialis

58, 1, ED caused by Propecia,I posted on 2/7/2015 to say I was very fit_ running_ gym etc.  This is an update.Two months after taking this drug I am still having muscle fatigue issues and general lethargy.  Have always been very fit previously.  I'm wondering if the damage is permanent.There are no other medical Issues that can be causing this (I've been checked out).AVOID THIS DRUG.,,M,42, 5mg 1X O,4/9/2015,Cialis
