1, 1, regulate period/prevent pregnancy,extreme moodiness/irritability_ fatigue_ period changed start date twice,I am stopping Myzilra once this pill pack is finished. My doctor switched me to Myzilra from another birth control brand. With that birth control I felt fine and never saw any changes in my mood or routine due to the medication. Once I started taking myzilra I started becoming frequently aggitated at things that would have not been a big deal before. Also_ the day my period started every month changed and then changed back. My periods also got significantly heavier during the first day or two than they were on the other birth control. At the end of this pack_ I am ceasing birth control use altogether.,F,19,4  months1 pill 1X D,5/28/2013Email,Myzilra
