0, 4, Long heavy periods & mood swings,Mostly good!  Improved periods & mood.  Still had vaginal dryness though.,I have suffered from very long_ heavy_ and frequent (often twice a month) periods for the last 3 years and severe mood swings for about 4 years.  My OB-GYN put me back on birth control pills to try and control these symptoms.  I've tried many pills in the last few years.  Some helped a bit with my periods.  Zovia was the first pill to help A LOT with both my periods and my mood swings.  It has been a savior!  I still have vaginal dryness and am going to give HRT a try_ but if I don't get any further improved results with HRT_ I will be running back to Zovia!,F,40,9  months 1X D,1/9/2012Email,Zovia 1/35e-21
