TAKE ACTION. I will never again listen to what a doctor tells me. i had to do my own research to understand why these things were happening to me...he never even told me_ even after I asked multiple times why these things were happening to me.

3, 1, bipolar I syndrome,rapid weight gain despite diet efforts_ massive hair loss_ lethargy_ loss of interest in  activities I used to enjoy_ constant headaches (I had never suffered from headaches before),I strongly recommend taking an active role in managing the type of medication you are prescribed. After all_ you are the one taking them and having the side effects_ your doctor is merely prescribing them. Never be passive about your treatment. Research the side effects and even if your doctor does not believe you_ insist on your arguments or get other opinions. After 6 months of going through absolute hell from all the side effects you can think of I decided to tell my doctor I would not take valproic acid since it was doing more harm than good. Most doctors dislike patients doing research on the meds they are taking_ since they believe they are the owners of the truth_ but they would definitely change their opinions if they were the ones taking such medicines. Thanks to valproic acid I have lost the little self esteem I had left.,F,44,4  days,6/5/2006Email,Valproic acid
