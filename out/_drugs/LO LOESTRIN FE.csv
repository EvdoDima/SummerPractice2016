0, 2, To try to reduce a thick uterine lining,I had a brutal 9 day bloodbath in the middle of my cycle (filling multiple pads and tampons daily.) The cramps were more than I'm used to_ but not unbearable. I assumed it would have been done with the bleeding after the 9 days in the middle of the month_ but sure enough my period showed up right on time. My period was a normal flow for me. I didn't continue taking the pill after the first month of use because it caused far more problems than benefits. My acne came back_ I was irritable_ and everything felt somewhat off emotionally and physically. I've been off of it for a few weeks and I have a bit of cramping and some weight gain as a result. I'm hoping I'm just bloating and my body is trying to adjust to the hormonal change.,I do believe this pill can be useful in some circumstances and is worth trying_ but discuss the risks and side effects with your doctor. My doctor said all of these symptoms were possible and we decided it was still worth trying for the condition that I have. Not the worst thing in the world_ but not for me.,F,22,1  months,8/15/2016Email,Lo loestrin fe

I feel so sick I can't even sleep.  It's actually 145 AM right now! So not worth it.,F,39,1  days,7/30/2016,Lo loestrin fe
3, 1, heavy bleeding.  how ironic,"Started this on the first day of my period as directed.. Same time everyday.  Have been bleeding in various amounts every day for 22 days straight.  The first ten days were a light bleed followed by eight days of very heavy clotting running down my legs mess.  The past four days have been spotting/very light bleeding.  I feel crampy all of the time_ all month long.  Im extremely irritable & going off in rages followed by depression and guilt.  I feel like im in a very dark place now.  My libido has dropped.  I have insomnia for the first time in my life.  I feel afraid to go to sleep    and must take a sleeping pill every night.  I eat everything thats not nailed down.  My weight is quickly going up.  By far the worst is the low dark depression that has gotten worse & worse since i started Lo Loestrin Fe.  Im supposed to start my withdrawal bleed in a few days and i wonder how thats gonna go.  Everyone including My dr says i need to give this med three months.   So i feel like i need to wait for the magical day when my body finally ""adjusts"" to the pill.  But  this just seems unreasonable.  This  pill is just a complete nightmare and women are made to feel bad if we dont ""stick it out"" for 3 months!  Why???  Dont we deserve better than to lose months of our lives in a crazy mental and physical distressed state just so we can see if it will work??  Ugh please!!",I was on bc pills for nearly 20 years and have never had side.effects like this.  This is NOT acceptable!!,F,,3  weeks1qd,7/22/2016Email,Lo loestrin fe
4, 1, Heavy periods and heavy bleeding,So I was on Lo Loestrin Fe for 12 months and I had so many issues. The first came three months in. My periods got worse_ and I had abdominal pain that impaired my breathing. 4 months in I gained 50 pounds and had severe cramping. My periods became unpredictable and I couldn't tell when they would start again_ most of the time I was having periods every two weeks. Finally stopped taking them after I had horrible pains that required an ambulance and a trip to the er.,This is literally the worse pill I've been on and now because of it I weight an unhealthy amount. Devastated me and my life. Also now my hair is brittle_ falling out... I'm off this pill. I'm still having trouble loosing this newly gained weight and that is unacceptable.,F,22,12  months30 MG 1X D,7/21/2016,Lo loestrin fe
5, 1, For heavy periods and anemia.,Started Lo Loestrin on day 1 of my period.  By day 4 I had developed terrible mood swings including extreme irritability and rage.  The headaches started and my head had a fuzzy feeling.  I wanted to stop the pill but my husband and mom said to give it more time.  My period was lighter instantly BUT its day 11 and I am still spotting all day and I have terrible cramps.  The rage is a little better but.headaches continue.  One bothersome side effect is sleepyness.  I'm SO TIRED!  Its such a tremendous effort to get anything done.Wish this spotting & cramping would stop.  From the other posts i've read_ it can go on for months.  Ugh.  The pads/tampons irritate me if i wear them this long so i take them off at home and just mess up my undies so i can get a break.  I hate this pill so far.  Hope it gets better soon.  Right now i'm in my bed with horrible cramps googling about it.  I'm so miserable but my Dr.  Says i need to wait the full 3 months before switching.  If men had any idea what we endure ...ugh.,I used other birth control when I was in my twenties and never had problems with any of them like I do with this one.,F,43,2  weeks,7/11/2016,Lo loestrin fe
6, 1, Multiple painful periods a month,Helped with period however gained close to 10lbs. Also broke out in horrible cystic acne. Could not figure out why. I have always had perfect skin to the point where I would skip school if I had a single pimple. This medicine made me have disgusting cystic acne all over my face. I lost all confidence. Would not leave the house. Now my clothes don't fit. 3 days not taking the pill and my face has already totally cleared up. Hopefully the dark spots do not last. Very upsetting. Worst medicine ever. I would rather have 3 painful periods a month than take another one of these pills.,DO NOT TAKE!!!,F,18,3  months1/10,7/6/2016Email,Lo loestrin fe

I cry I don't sleep well I sweat all the time and I am very snappy! This was suppose to help regulate my cycle but instead I have no cycle. I have also been breaking out in hives for 2 months and now this makes sense it's the pills!! I am miserable on it! My Dr told me all pills will cause nausea at first but to try and get through it. Well I did and I have had nothing but problems from this pill.,F,25,2  months,7/5/2016,Lo loestrin fe
8, 1, Prevent pregnancy,My doctor prescribed this birth control for me because it had lower dosages of hormones. However since the first pill I haven't been myself. Headaches_ dizziness_ fatigue_ sweaty all the time_ upset stomach_ and today was the final straw. I had a vomitig episode. Then I started to get light headed and dizzy and I passed out. I've never had any of this happen to me prior to taking this pill. Would not recommend.,,F,22,3  days,6/11/2016,Lo loestrin fe
9, 1, Contraceptive,Horrible side effects. I've been on this pill twice. Both times I experienced the SAME side effects. I forgot how nuts it made me the first time around. It's made me feel like I'm on anabolic steroids with my rage. My boyfriend can't say anything to me without me snapping_ I want to kill everyone_ I eat everything that isn't nailed down_ and I haven't been exercising like I usually have. I am going back on Seasonique because I feel like a normal human being on that medication. DO NOT GET ON THIS PILL. I'm stopping it a few days before my period because I threw tupperware at my boyfriend yesterday and it's turning me into the HULK. Ah.,,F,28,3  months 1X D,6/9/2016,Lo loestrin fe
10, 4, To prevent pregnancy,Breast Tenderness_ weight gain (~15lbs)_ sometimes no menstrual cycle,I honestly think this is a great birth control but I'm starting to think it is not good for long term use. I have had a pretty pleasant experience with this birth control. This is the only birth control I've ever taken in my life and I started a couple weeks before I got married for family planning purposes. Occasionally I have missed my cycle which always causes me to take pregnancy tests. And now I am starting to speculate that the 15lbs of weight I have gained is because of birth control because my eating habits have not changed drastically. I would recommend this pill but after 1.5 years_ I think you should find an alternative.,F,25,2  years 1X D,6/3/2016,Lo loestrin fe
11, 2, prevent pregnancy,I have been on this medication for almost 2 yrs and I am just realizing that its no good I have gained about 20lbs just this year at first my periods would come every month now I haven't had one.

My Dr recommend this_but it has been nothing but an annoyance. I always had clear skin minus the one or two small breakouts here and there.

14, 1, Painful ovulation,Breast/nipple soreness_ weight gain_ mood swings_ increased blood pressure,I started taking Minastrin for pain I was having during ovulation_ but my blood pressure increased a great deal so my doctor switched me to Lo Loestrin. BP went down slightly_ but I stopped the pill when I started having pretty severe breast pain that I just couldn't handle anymore. I also didn't care for the fact that I didn't get a real period on it_ and I wanted to stop before I started getting more severe side effects. I think the pill is just not for me_ but I definitely wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.,F,30,2  months,5/15/2016,Lo loestrin fe

This is the second pill I have tried and so far I have not been satisfied with either. I can't stand being depressed and anxious_ and now I have no sex drive so it makes the birth control pointless.

23, 1, Birth Contrpl,This is the worse birth control in the entire world. I was previously on Ortho but switched to this as my doctor said it would help with my moods. No way. I've become a raging hormonal monstor_ my boobs hurt all the time_ my periods are not regular_ I've gained weight_ and have the worse cramps I've ever experienced. And then_ to make matters worse_ I got pregnant while taking this everyday at the same time without ever missing a single pill. I literally set an alarm on my phone.

24, 1, Avoid Pregnancy,Prolonged spotting between periodsCrampingFatigueMood swings,I've been taking various types of birth control since I was 15 years old_ and I've never had as many issues as I have with this pill. I'm relieved to hear that many other women are experiencing similar side effects that I am. I switched from the Nuva Ring due to irritation of my cervix and my OB/GYN recommended Lo Loestrin. I'm on my 3rd pill pack and I absolutely HATE this mediation. The first month I took it I bled for about 2 weeks in-between my cycle. It wasn't really heavy_ but it was definitely more than just spotting. The second month it got a little better_ but again_ right around ovulation_ I started bleeding and it lasted for about 10 days. My periods are practically nonexistent_ probably because I bleed so much in between. I've also experienced pretty significant swings_ which I believe are rather uncharacteristic for me. I seem to fly off the handle about minor issues and lose my cool more often than I retain it. The magnitude of side effects from this drug are rather astounding considering how low the dose is_ but after 3 months of this nonsense_ I'm stopping this BCP.,F,29,3  months 1X D,2/19/2016,Lo loestrin fe
25, 1, Painful periods_ birth control,Insomnia_ severe nausea_ night sweats_ diarrhea_ bloating,I'm very sensitive to medications and rarely take them but I couldn't stand my painful periods anymore. Dr prescribed this pill as the lowest dose available. Only took it two days but it's horrible. Wide awake with nausea and diarrhea in the middle of the night and the nausea lasting throughout the mornings. Gained two pounds in two days_ most likely due to water retention/bloating. Unusual hunger for junk food. Am stopping immediately. Based on all the previous reviews_ I do not want to gain 20+ pounds_ be depressed_ anxious_ mood swings_ etc. Will have to deal with period pain.,F,33,2  days,2/17/2016,Lo loestrin fe
26, 1, Extreme painful periods,Spotting_ loss of appetite_ weight losss_  depression_ lack of motivation,I switched to Loestrin from a stronger BC because it was causing nausea and vomiting. The first two months seemed great because the nausea was finally gone and all I had was some light spotting. I was feeling depressed about something going on in my life_ which depression usually kills my appetite when it's bad enough_ so I assumed that was it. But when things cleared up in my life_ my appetite didn't. I've lost over 5 lbs in a couple weeks on my 3rd pill pack_ weight I really didn't need to lose. I can hardly get myself to eat and I hate how I feel towards food. I have been feeling bouts of depression and extreme lack of motivation_ like life has no luster for seemingly no reason. I am normally a very happy person. Also_ during my third month_ I started spotting more heavily dark discharge halfway through the pack_ and it hasn't stopped. It's gotten heavier as the week for my period has arrived_ but it's black and clotty! I have headaches_ maybe from the pill or not eating enough. I feel miserable. I'm done with this crap.,F,23,3  months1-20mg 1X D,1/22/2016,Lo loestrin fe

28, 4, Constant horrific menstrual cramps,Breast pain_ possible weight gain_ possible decreased sex drive_ gastrointestinal issues at first,I started this medication because i was in constant horrible pain and my hormones were fluctuating wildly_ to the point where I'd have random periods throughout the month and be perfectly emotionally stable one day and suicidal or aggressive the next. It's possibly caused by endometriosis but whatever the case this pill has definitely helped me fight that.I say possible weight gain because I've gained about seven lb (when i had a menstrual cycle my weight would fluctuate up to six lb depending on the cycle and I took this from the average) but that might be because i switched from a job where I was standing and walking all day to a job where I have to sit for four hours a day_ and later because I've been actively trying to gain muscle mass (and it seems to be working-I can see the results). I've been hungrier lately and I think i might have more fat too but i think my metabolism is just trying to adjust to the new muscle and I haven't checked my body fat percentage in a while...that being said_ if i gain too much more fat I'll have to say it's probably the pill.I say possible decreased sex drive but that may just be stress or something and sometimes it DOESN'T seem decreased-usually I'm insatiable and can't afford to go a day without masturbating but lately I've been able to miss a few days...if that continues I'll be worried_ but even without medication I'll occasionally have times where it's not as strong_ just like I occasionally have times where I'm even worse tha,M,21,3  months,1/15/2016,Lo loestrin fe

39, 2, periods and pregnancy,weight gain_ no periods at all_ crazy mood swings,"When I first started taking lo loestrin fe I was 15 going on 16 in two months my sophomore year of high school April 2014. I weighed about 115-120 lbs. and I was a happy girl always. Now I am a senior in September 2015 and just turned 17 almost 3 months ago and I weigh almost 140lbs. I don't know if I should blame it on a rough winter last year or this pill_ but I have a hard time believing that my naturally tiny and thin body randomly gained weigjt from poor health habits. Nothing about my diet or exercise changed since I started taking this but it seemed as though this happened during the winter of my junior year. All of the sudden I tried on my old prom dress and realize ""Wow. I am NOT as skinny as before"" being able to hardly zipper it. It is a confidence crushing fact I deal with every day with looking through old pictures of me from before and looking at myself now. Everything on my body has gained weight_ not just tummy or thighs. Everything. I am planning to see a doctor/gyno soon about it because I really believe it's from Lo Loestrin as a long term side effect. This random weight gain happened over Winter 2014. Also_ my mood swings are AWFUL and I didn't have a period while on this pill until this summer. It's a horrible feeling to feel as though you are not yourself.

40, 1, Birth control/heavy painful periods,I gained so much weight and became completely uncomfortable in my body. None of my clothes fit right. I was miserable. I constantly complained to my husband about my weight gain and got on his nerves. The weight was mainly in my lower stomach. Not cute!! My self-esteem and body image was ruined. I also could not get a good nights rest. The bags under my eyes were unbelievable. I would cramp all month! Just random cramping out of the blue.,My periods were shorter but the pain was still the same. I used to pass blood clots with my period and that stopped as well. I am so frustrated because I can not choose between having a shorter period and being overweight and uncomfortable in my skin. I took Microgetstin 1/20 for 3 months and lost the weight but my periods are longer and I started passing clots again. I would not recommend Lo Loestrin to anyone!

My beautiful_ athletic_ active daughter started using this birth control method four years ago. She has fought a twenty pound weight gain ever since while staying very physically active in college.  Her acne which she kept under control in high school worsened significantly.  She complained of gas_ nausea_  and stomach aches. She went from being very happy and well adjusted to mood swings of being extremely fatigued_  moody_  irritable_  stressed_ sad_ and flat out angry at times. She didn't understand it. I put it down to a highly active and demanding college schedule and changing  majors and schools once. However_ she has not felt good for most of this time.  We never thought of her birth control.  She even went to her physician and they found nothing out of sorts. Being young one would have no idea that hormone birth control could do that and I did not have that trouble. I stumbled across this forum while researching lo loestrin fe and pregnancy symptoms thinking her hormones were out of whack for that reason. I am devastated this birth control severely affected her for four years and I thought she was suffering from college stress and fatigue.,F,22,4  years,7/26/2015,Lo loestrin fe
48, 1, Ovarian cysts_ prevent pregnancy,Anxiety_ panic attacks_ depression_ insomnia_ mood swings_ zero sex drive_ extreme irritability,The first month on this pill_ everything seemed fine. Then the second month I started to experience mood swings and constantly feeling tired. I lost my sex drive completely. By the end of that pack my mood swings turned into a psychotic rage over the littelest things. I finished 22 of the pills from my 3rd pack and I am now having insomnia for the last 3 nights. I cry at the drop of a hat and when I'm not crying I'm screaming. My husband and I have agreed that this pill is not for me and I have discontinued as of last night. I also have not had a period the entire time I've been taking it_ not even spotting. I hope everything balances out soon because I feel like a crazy person!,F,27,3  months10 mcg,7/7/2015,Lo loestrin fe
49, 1, Cysts and pms -major mood swings,Insomnia_ depression_ lethargic_ slight acne and hair loss,I've only been taking this bc for a few days and I've already noticed major side effects. I'm not sleeping well at night and find myself exhausted during the day and wanting to nap_ which I've never done in my life! Already noticed some slight hair loss and breaking out on my face. Worst of all is I feel really super depressed and I really shouldn't. I have zero motivation and I'm usually always active and generally positive. I just feel like crap. I'm going to talk to my doctor today and have him give me something else to get rid of the cysts or just let them be.,F,35,4  days1 mg,7/6/2015,Lo loestrin fe
50, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,Trouble falling asleep and staying asleep_ bloating_ pelvic pain_ mild depression_ emotional wreck_ paranoia_ anxiety/ panic attacks_ nausea_ memory loss_ heavy period_ loss of appetite,Never taken birth control in my life. I was only four days into the pack and I was experiencing pelvic pain and bloating. Started it when I was ovulating so this didn't help the pain I was already in. Always happy_ level headed_ and confident I was suddenly crying at my job for NO REASON_ I still am so emotional and I feel like I'm going crazy_ I stopped the pill on 6/17 and I still don't feel like myself! Recently went to the doctors and I was diagnosed with mild depression. This pill has absolutely ruined my mentality. I hope to balance out soon cause this is awful! Would not recommend to anyone!!,F,22,4  days,7/3/2015Email,Lo loestrin fe
51, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Anxiety and Depression,I decided to give this low dose a chance and I regret it. After month 2_ I started having severe anxiety and mood swings. My final straw was the severe depression in month 4 so I quit. It's been two months since quitting and I still feel the anxiety. Hopefully I balance back out soon.,F,25,1  months1,6/29/2015,Lo loestrin fe
52, 1, pre menapose,EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN. about 10 to 15 pounds without a change in diet or exercise. headaches everyday. severe cramps. breakthrough bleeding all the time. Insomnia. Tired all the time every day . Sleep with no rest. emotional issues.Angry all the time.No sex drive. No drive for anything. Swelling of breast.(painful),I was on this pill for 1 full month and 15 days into month 2. Then i just couldnt take it anymore.At first i noticed i was gaining weight at a very rapid rate and im very active. Then my breast started to swell to the point where it felt like i was breast feeding again. Im a smaller chest size woman so any change in size is going to hurt like all hell i went from a 34 nearly b to a 36 D in this short period of time and i was in pain all day every day i just wanted to cry. Then the breakthough bleeding started to happen and i took the pills as prescribed didnt miss a beat. my hair began to come out in clumps in the shower and my stomach stayed upset 90 percent of the time. Then by the end of month 1 i was angry all the time didnt matter what it was i was upset. no sex drive whatsoever and i couldnt sleep i would sleep then get up or sleep all day and feel even more tired then before. I told my husband i couldnt do this anymore and i am going to try a natural cream instead. i went off of these horrible pills 3 days ago and still no relief just a lot of heavy bleeding and cramping. my best advice to any of you run away and tell the doctor not just no but HELL NO. I wouldnt wish these pills on my worse enemy,F,30,1  months 1X D,6/18/2015Email,Lo loestrin fe

54, 1, Birth control,Insomnia_ depression_ hair loss_ nausea_ headaches_ diarrhea,The first 2 months I bled every 2 weeks. The third month was a short period and by the 4th month I didn't have a period at all. I literally thought I was going crazy or something was seriously wrong with me because I felt horrible. It wasn't until recently that I realized it was this BC pill that was causing me to experience all the ridiculous symptoms... I was literally exhausted but couldn't get to sleep. Once I fell asleep I was up 2 hours later. Definitely felt depressed and sooo angry all the time. Hair came out in clumps in the shower. I seemed to be nauseous quite a bit and had diarrhea almost every day. It is just not worth taking the pill with these side effects. I have never reacted to BC pills like this before.,F,33,4  months,6/8/2015,Lo loestrin fe
55, 5, ovarian cysts_ regulate periods,None-maybe a headache here and there..although_those could be life and work related.,"Best birth control ever! I have been on BC since I was 19 due to my cysts. I've have many issues with other BC such as kidney pain_ cystic acne_etc. I am a small petite person_ I needed a low hormone pill to make sure i had a period every month. I was so thankful when this came out. I'm not ""big"" enough body fat wise for a lot of BC out there. And this is perfect. I still miss a period here and there_ but I'm active and eat super healthy so that's not abnormal to miss a period. Great BC for us small/active females. And I still have a very high sex drive. No issues whatsoever.",F,28,2  years,6/1/2015,Lo loestrin fe

Never in my life have I dealt with anxiety or panic attacks. Since I got on that pill I had fears of dying or having a heart attack. Couldn't breathe or see at times. Been to every doctor possible_ had many exams done_ even went to see a psychologist. I don't recommend this pill to no one.,F,29,1  years 1X D,5/28/2015,Lo loestrin fe
57, 4, irregular heavy painful periods,Anxiety_ dizziness_ nausea_ lack of energy,I am very apprehensive about any birth control. I have tried nuva ring and a different pill (not sure which one). This pill so far has had the most dramatic side effects. I bleed for two weeks straight when I first started. I have always suffered from anxiety and depression.The first month on this my anxiety was really bad but I can't say it was the pills fault. It might of just been legitimately my nerves. Any way after the first month my period was very light_ not painful_ and after getting used to taking the pill every day my nerves have subsided and I feel level. The dizziness hasn't gone away though. It comes in spurts and I know I just need to drink some water and sit down for a second. DO NOT SMOKE!! I was a smoker and if I smoked a cig on this pill I puked!! So it help me quit lol.,F,24,2  months,5/27/2015Email,Lo loestrin fe
58, 5, Severe menstrual cramps_ PMS_ acne,Breast tenderness_ dizziness and nausea in beginning.,First time on a BC pill_ about to finish my second pack_ and I feel great! The first four days or so I felt very dizzy and nauseous after taking the pill - almost as if I were on a boat. I was hoping it would subside soon_ and it did! Now I don't feel dizzy or nauseous_ thankfully_ and everything's going well. My body hasn't fully adjusted yet though_ and I'm getting my period randomly for several days in the middle of my pack_ and not when I take the placebos. But_ it is lighter and much less painful so far_ which is great. The acne is definitely calming down and any pimples I do get aren't too bad and are easy to manage (ie they go away quickly). Although my boobs are sore as hell_ I don't mind because they've definitely gotten bigger (which is never a bad thing :)). Oh and my moods are definitely more leveled out.,F,26,2  months1mg/10mcg 1X D,5/21/2015,Lo loestrin fe
