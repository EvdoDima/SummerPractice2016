0, 1, High blood pressure & Arrhythmia,Chest pains_ Constipation_ Lack of focus_ Exhaustion,Worst drug I have ever taken. Started out with some minor constipation_ nothing big. Then the drug started to lose It's effect so the doctor told me to increase the dosage to 80mg from 40mg. Went like that for a month_ constipations grew ever so more painful and eventually one day when I woke up at 6-7 AM_ I started having stabbing and cramping chest pains. Had to go to the hospital and once I'm there_ everything checks out fine until a cardiologist presses and massages my heart muscles to recreate the intense stabbing pains and wouldn't you know it. the drug has essentially made sections of my heart to become inflamed_ resulting in severe pains every 3-5 seconds.If this drug does not help you at a 40mg dose_ avoid it like the black plague.,M,22,3  months40-120 MG 2X D,10/27/2014Email,Isoptin
