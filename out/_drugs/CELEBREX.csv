0, 5, Joint pain,For 6 mths I've suffered chronic pain in the morning woken from sleep in pain in my joints. It started in my knees_ then elbows & wrists. But 2 mths ago it started in my hips & lower back_ & as my sleep was interrupted DAILY_ so was my life. As soon I get up the pain would go_ but the other day it wouldn't. So I went to my Dr who gave me Celebrex. I was scared to take it reading bad reviews. So I rang my Dr & he said take it & let me know how you feel tomorrow. I took it last night & can't believe I waited THIS long to try it. For the 1st time in 6 mths I woke with NO pain & it made me drowsy_ which was a bonus. Celebrex WORKED for me so I want to write a POSITIVE review for people out there who are scared off by bad reviews I read HERE. I'm pain free_ so I hope it works for others as it has me. I am PAIN FREE!!!,The only side effect I had was drowsiness_ which was a good one_ as I haven't had a good nights sleep in 6 months!,F,36,1  days200mg 1X D,7/27/2016Email,Celebrex

10, 1, joint pain,About 30 minutes after taking Celebrex with milk_ I felt an explosion in my chest_ broke out in an itchy allergic rash accompanied by dysphoria_ heart palpitations_ and closing of the throat.  That was 8 weeks ago.  Since then_ I've had one episode of nausea accompanied by cold sweats_ heart palpitation and dysphoria to the point of almost passing out.  In fact_ I had all of the symptoms of a heart attack.  I choose to go to the emergency room.  My heart passed with flying colors but the symptoms haven't gone away.  When I told the Doctor at the ER what I had taken_ along with my history since_ he shook his head and said I was lucky.  My real problem is gastrointestinal.  Right now_ I suffer from gurd_ accompanied by pain in upper left_ middle and left sections of the abdomen.  I have never suffered gastrointestinal problems in my life!  At this point_ I can't even eat a couple of tablespoons of tuna without experiencing heart burn and worse.   I will be going to a regular doct,"I would not recommend Celebrex to anyone for anything_ not because it doesn't work to alleviate the pain associated with arthritis or joint pain but because the side effects are devastating.  It simply isn't worth it.  If I can stop one person from taking this and ruining their gastrointestinal tract_ believe me this is painful and could very well be chronic and life threatening_ I will have done my job.  DON""T TAKE THIS!",F,59,1  days200mg 1X D,1/11/2016,Celebrex
11, 1, Arthritis,Thank God I did not take this drug. I'm only reviewing to warn people that if you have a life threatening sulfa allergy like I do_ do not take this medicine.,My doctor prescribed this to me well aware of my sulfa allergy. My allergy is so severe and I'm so sensitive to sulfa that I cannot ingest anything with sulfates in it either. While the sulfate reaction isn't life threatening_ it has sent me to the ER before with severe heart palpitations and feeling as though I was having a heart attack. I went to fill the prescription & my pharmacy alerted me Celebrex contains sulfa. I called my doctor's office and ask why they would prescribe me a medication with sulfa & they shrugged it off stating it's just a trace amount. A trace amount is all it would take to close my throat. Needless to say I got a new doctor within the week.,F,49,1  days,1/7/2016Email,Celebrex

Blood panel showed significant changes outside of normal ranges in kidney function BUN/Creatinine ratio_ blood gulcose_  I have stopped taking this medication completely.,"My pain management doctor never checked my liver and kidney function and put me on the highest recommended dose.  I am a small person_ 5'3"" 123 lbs.  I have been a very healthy person all of my life until this accident_ I have never had abnormal blood panels.  My family doctor is the one who caught the problem_ not the pain management doctor.

27, 3, Rheumatoid Arthritis,I am 10 days into taking Celebrex. Days 1-8 were great... No side effects  and it helped with the severe pain_ stiffness and swelling in my hands and wrists. I went from not being able to use my hands to gaining full use of them. However yesterday_ day 9_ I began to have horrendous stomach which has not stopped. I have been lying in bed_ in the fetal position with a heating pad on my stomach. Even the morphine I take for my back (failed back syndrome) won't get this pain under control. I've decided to stop taking the Celebrex for few days to see if the stomach pain stops. If it does I'm going to try it one more time along with a PPI. If that doesn't work then I guess I'm back to not using my hands again.  It totally stinks because Celebrex has been the only medication which has helped my RA pain_ but I just can't take this stomach pain. It is like I have to choose the lesser of two evils... Excruciating RA pain or severe stomach pain. I wish there was something that worked as well as Celebrex without the side effects.,,F,36,10  days200,3/5/2015Email,Celebrex

Took first dose before bed_ upon waking the next morning I could hardly move my injured hand (the one the medicine was supposed to be helping)_ all of my joints hurt. Worse part was when I sat down on the couch every bone in my spine popped in secession_ moved again a couple minutes later and the same thing happened. I have never had a problem with my back before.

First thought it was asthma having been recently diagnosed but found that was not the case.,Was surprised to have had problems with this medication as I had taken it 3 years ago when I underwent knee replacement. Didn't appear to have any side effects at that time but was only on it for a couple of days.  This time_ the side effects were almost immediate.  Stopped taking exactly a week ago. Still having shortness of breath_ rapid heartbeat and fatigue with little/any exertion. Also effected my muscle coordination. Kept dropping things. Difficulty standing.

Called dr and told him of my side effects he said that Celebrex was not the cause but to stop taking until my appointment with in in 3 days. I've read that this medicine can cause blood cloth and stoke. I don't want to take this med,This medicine aggravated my gastritis and I specifically asked the dr if this will flare up my gastritis and he reassured me it won't. These drs prescribed meds they probably won't take themselves or give to family member.,F,50,5  days200mg,11/23/2014Email,Celebrex

43, 4, osteoarthritis,Celebrex has worked great for my joint stiffness and pain.  The only complaint I have is the horrible withdrawal symptoms I have if I forget to take it.  It has happened twice in the last two years.  I don't realize I have forgotten to take it until I begin to feel bad.  I take it daily and both times this occurred_ I had forgotten only one dose.  The symptoms came on suddenly...generally feeling ill_ like I had the flu.  I chilled_ had terrible muscle pain and achiness_ and my joint pain was 3x worse than before I started taking Celebrex.  Within an hour of taking a Celebrex_ the symptoms let up significantly both times and completely disappeared after several hours.  I have found testimony from a few others with similar symptoms.  This is the only complaint I have_ which seems to be very rare.  I read on another site that less than 1% of patients surveyed have experienced this.,,F,55,5  years,9/6/2014,Celebrex

46, 1, Osteoarthritis,It certainly relieved my arthritis symptoms and I was always extremely diligent about taking it on a full breakfast to avoid gastrointestinal side effects but......18 months ago I had a routine gastroscope and it found some small cellular changes in the lining of my stomach. I was commenced on Nexium and reduced my Celebrex to alternate mornings. Just had my second gastroscope and I have pre-malignant Barrett's plus pre-malignant changes in my gastric lining from reflux and heartburn. And I had no symptoms since taking Nexium. I was advised by the gastroenterologist to NEVER take Celebrex again due to the potentially life-threatening changes in pathology. And yes_ I have been almost teetotal for 32 years and a non-smoker for 35 years.,If you have ANY symptoms of heartburn_ reflux_ GORD.....get a gastroscopy as soon as possible.

49, 5, Bilateral ankle fractures,None,I have taken Celebrex since I had car wreck in 1995_ which I almost severed both feet off at the ankles. I was never suppose to walk again. This is a wonderful medication. NO ONE knows my pain with every step I take. Celebrex has not made all the pain go away_ because I am a paramedic and work 16-24 hour shifts_ but it makes a considerable difference. I can either take it and walk or not take it and not walk or play with my grandchild. Every body is different to any drug. I think it is up the each individual on taking it and live with the side effects and long term effects_ I know what it can do.
