0, 1, UTI,Highly nauseous_ dizzy_ lethargic_ slow speaking_ depressed_ didn't want to get out of bed. I am substitute teacher and the kids asked me if I was on drugs because my speech was a bit slurred and I couldn't come up with simple words to talk. Like I had a stroke or something. I am finishing up my last dose and all I want to do is lay in bed. I also have had some really weird dreams and wake up scared. I don't drink coffee_ alcohol or take any prescription drugs. I am a very clean eating_ exercising_ hyper girl_ but this med has changed my entire personality in a week...ugghh!,,F,44,5  days500 2X D,12/4/2015Email,Cipro hc
1, 1, Chronic ear infections.,"Incredibly painful when inserting in to ears with a dropper. Almost made me think an eardrum had ruptured.Felt anxious and couldn't get my brain to ""stop""_ I couldn't focus and was very tired and drowsy. Also gained weight within one week of taking the drops. Woke up with a headache daily and was easily irritable which is not normally in my nature at all.",I have suffered from chronic ear infections for about 7 months. I've taken 7 courses of abtibiotics_ none worked_ so my Dr has referred me to an ENT Specialist and recommended these drops in the meantime.I don't feel they've helped at all and I'm purely relying on Nurofen or other painkillers to keep a cap on the pain. Useless drug for me.,F,26,7  days10mL,12/1/2014Email,Cipro hc
2, 1, UTI,I tolerated 4 days of Cipro; the fifth day or 9th pill was horrendous.  Within 10 minutes of taking pill after breakfast I suddenly developed severe dizziness and was lucky to find a nearby chair before I fell. Room spun around and I became severely nauseated.  My husband found me a puke pot and my breakfast came up as well as partially dissolved pill.  I remained dizzy for the next hour and couldn't leave chair for fear of falling.  Finally made it to bed and after another hour could get up without dizziness.  Took no more Ciprofloxacin.,,F,80,4  days250 3X D,6/9/2014Email,Cipro hc
3, 1, kidney infection,I fell asleep the night I started taking cipro and I could not be awaken for 14 hours. I was so out of it I took the tp to bed with me after I got up for an hour to take more. I could not stay awake the rest of the day. Like mixing pain meds and alcohol.,,F,27,2  days500,3/23/2014,Cipro hc

5, 3, UTI/Bladder infection,extreme fatigue_ joint pain especially in shoulder_ nausea_ constipation_ light headed_ dizziness_ popping in lower back_ back pain_ feeling of hopelessness_ depression_ and extreme weight gain_ cloudy thoughts_ I was on cipro and I gained 10 lbs in about a 2 week period of time.,If you are able to deal with the side effects_ then I would recommend this drug. I guess the benefits out weigh the side effects and risks.,F,48,10  days 2X D,4/16/2012Email,Cipro hc
6, 5, UTI but it also helped another prob,None.,Orginally put on for 3 days.  UTI symptoms improved but infection did not clear.  5 days_ 250mg_ 2x per day_ cleared the UTI AND coicidentally helped a skin rash_ elsewhere_ that hadn't responded to multiple medications.,F,45,5  days250mg 2X D,3/18/2012,Cipro hc
7, 3, Diverticulitis,this is a very scary drug to take_ I have had vivid nightmares_ aching pains in my joints_ extream tiredness_ flu like symptoms_ madding thoughts of hurting others_acid reflux so bad I could feel it in my sinuses_burning behind the eyes_I hear poping sounds in my color bones_my chest_elbows_ back and spine area ect. I am a 39 year old male taking this with Flangyl to fight Diverticulits.,"Most of all of this started after comming home from the hospital_ I didn't know it was these meds alone that was causeing my proablems because while I was in the hospital I was given these drugs through IV_ wasn't allowed to eat or drink by mouth and was given injections of Morphine for the pain. So of corse I was blamming the combo of drugs on what I was dealing with in the Hospital_ but once I came home and started the pill form of these drugs I started to feel the full side effects and was thinking I was going to die by day 3. I have fought through the madness because I want to be healed of the pain and have yet to be seen by my regular doctor. I must have drove the on call nurse through my insurance crazy with ""am I alright"" questions. I am still bothered bby what this drug does to the human mind and body. If you are on this medacation I suggest talking with a Shrink to help pull you through because your doctor will say your just crazy as long as your not running a feaver of 101.5 and not bleeding in your stool. If you are a sufferer and would like to have someone to talk to feel free to e-mail me.",M,39,6  days500 2X D,3/5/2012Email,Cipro hc
8, 5, UTI,Absolutely none_ except a bit of nausea the first time I took it_ which vanished pretty quick.,Not entirely done with my first prescription of Cipro (5 days)_ but on day 2 I've already noticed much less burning with my UTI. Avoid bactrim and that other one if possible_ Cipro is apparently much more effective. Also_ disregard the horror stories here unless you have bad medical history. I have a horrible immune system and I feel sick often_ and I had NO side-effects aside from the first bit of nausea (I did scarf a meal directly after though_ that probably caused it). This antibiotic gets two thumbs up from me_ especially since it only cost me $4 without insurance :]I recommend this_ highly.,F,18,5  days500mg 2X D,12/28/2011,Cipro hc
9, 4, UTI Bladder and kidney infection,unable to sleep at night during the first 3 or 4 days_ slight aches in body during first few days_ strange headache pain behind one eye experienced during mid week which went away after two painkillers (perheps too much lighting around me that day?) but apart from that this medicine worked for me and overall worth it. I have just finished the whole course of antibiotics and I feel a lot better. A little weary that I may still have a slight kidney infection or maybe a kidney stone. I will give it a couple of days. No problem with urine_ drinking at least 3 litres of water for the past 2 weeks_ before that upto or at least 2 litres of water a day. Urine is somewhat cloudy. I can tell there are white blood cells because of this. I will wait a few days to see how I feel and pay very close attention to what my body is telling me.,Overall this medicine is very good. This is the second time I have used this antibiotic. First time was when I first got a UTI with all the classic symptoms of a lower UTI/ bladder infection which was 2 years ago. This time I didnt have problem urinating buy my pain was more in the kidney area. I had flank pain. My flank pain is pretty much gone but I only feel 90 percent better. My urine is somewhat cloudy although Im drinking at least 3 litres of water a day and keeping fairly active also a little ache on my left side but almost gone/ on and off. I'm giving it two more days_ I should feel 100 percent by them if not Im making a trip to the doctor because even if my uti has completely cleared and its not a kidney stone it would be something else. But I do feel so much better,F,26,7  days500mg 2X D,1/28/2011,Cipro hc
10, 4, cUTI (Complicated UTI),Lethargy_ Joint Pains_ Palpitations_ Constipation_ Blurry Vision,Regardless of all its side effects_ Cipro has indeed served well in treating UTI. It seems too strong for a medication_ or I may just have a very weak immune system to begin  with.,F,21,10  days500 mg 2X D,1/16/2011,Cipro hc
11, 5, UTI/INNER EAR INFECTION,STIFF NECK.  A VERY SHORT PERIOD LIKE CRAMPS FOR A FEW MINUTES ON AND OFF,I have taken this more than 3 times_ I get UTI often since my daughter was born 16 month ago. And it does work. My ear is 95% feeling better. Yes side effects are scary for all of us_ so is driving a car. Get over it. It helps..and have you noticed that the older the woman the worse off they are with this medication..bc i saw a 23 yr old who said she loved it..no problems..im in my mid20s and NEVER had an issue!,F,25,12  days500 2X D,11/29/2010Email,Cipro hc
12, 1, UTI,Unusual weight gain and extreme fatigue.  My weight always stays close to 110 lbs_ in 1 week I weigh 118.  I was horribly hungry and gained between 5 and 8 lbs.  I had to drop the dosage half way through the week to 1/2 because it was too strong_ and then I stopped taking it before the 10 days because my clothes are so tight..this is UNREAL!!!,I HATE THIS MEDICATION =/,F,46,7  days500 mg 2X D,11/28/2010,Cipro hc
13, 4, Strep Throat,Tendon pain_ nausea_ loose bowels_ insomnia,Side effects diminished with a week of being on Cipro_ began to have significant improvement over the past 2 days in particular. This is the third time I've been on Cipro for an illness. It's the only antibiotic I can take without life threatening side effects and works very well.,F,39,11  days 2X D,10/29/2010Email,Cipro hc
14, 4, Food Poisoning,None. Read my comment to the right.,I was very sick for 6 days. Within 2 hours of taking this medication I was no longer sick or in pain and this pill healed me. My goodness everyone wrote horror stories on here. The ONLY side effect I had was I became sleepy. For the overly concerned that does not mean fainting or power sleeping. I mean I felt a bit sleepy for about 20 minutes then it stopped. I felt relaxed and not alarmed at all. It is easy on the stomach. I have a sensitive stomach. I took it with food and drank full bottle of water. I am going on day 3. Dear overly concerned notice your heart is beating faster before even taking the medication. This is because your brain controls your body_ just as if someone jumped out and scared you your heart rate rises_ which indicates the body and brain relationship. Stop driving yourself insane. I did. BAD. And look. I ended up being sleepy lol. Email me if you need any help. It is to the right of this box.,M,28,5  days500 2X D,9/19/2010Email,Cipro hc
15, 1, Possible Strep Throat,"Cannot drive car_had to pull over_ too much anxiety_Panic.  Feeling profound sadness_ suicidal thinking. My normal blood pressure is sky high now. Feet and hands hurt and tingle. Lower back pain_ very irritable_ jumpy at the slightest noise. A ""hangover"" feeling and spacy.",Went to doc about it_ he told me to stop it immediately. labs show I didn't have Strep throat after all_(took it for nothing)But it may be the reason for the strange lab result showing my hypothyroidism (low) which was always within normal level with the thyroid med_ lab test now shows it is Hyperthyroid_ which is VERY STRANGE and now there is protein in my urine which means kidney is being damaged_ this is puzzling my G.P.and I. And I'm sure it's aggravating the symptoms I'm having_ but how long will this go on?? They've reduced my thyroid meds now hoping that will go back to normal_ I've been off the Ciprofloxacin 500mg for 7 days. Still it feels as though I'm getting worse_ not better. It's a shame this med can cause this since it can really help knock out an infection. But_ this is the end for me using this med from now on. I also use the ear drops for chronic ear problems_ but have now gone back to the old fashioned one. My suggestion to anyone that is prescribed this_ start out with a very small dosage for a few days and see how it works for you. You may be glad you did that_ you wouldn't want to be feeling what me and others I've read on here are or have gone through with this med.,F,52,5  days250mg 2X D,2/11/2010,Cipro hc
16, 1, UTI,Numb from hips down to toes in both legs.  Muscle spasms_ naseau and dry heaves.,Writing this in regards to my mother.  She was just prescribed this for a UTI.  She's taken 7 pills and is not able to walk.  Have contacted local emergency rooms and they are referring us to speak with our local pharmacist.  She is stopping this immdediately.  I'm praying to God that her side effects will stop.  She is currently being treated for Colorectal cancer and doesn't need anything else to worry about.  Please do not take this medicine.  I wish I would have known about this before she went on it!,F,60,4  days,1/9/2010Email,Cipro hc
17, 5, Kidney and UTI infection,None,Was having quite a bit of pain in my kidney area lower back_ about 12 hours after the first dose_ I started feeling so much better. The kidney pain was gone and the burning in my pelvic area reduced. I was feeling really ill before the first dose with fatigue_ chills_ head fogginess_ no appetite and all of those symptoms resolved withing the first 24 hours. It's a wonderful miracle drug for me!,F,37,7  days,11/17/2009,Cipro hc
18, 3, UTI,Had very rapid heartbeat on 500 mg.   Prescription was changed to 250 mg.  Worked quickly to reduce symptoms of the UTI but was very anxious and exhausted most of the time.  Also have had joint pain in hands_ neck and legs.  Did help with the UTI however.,,F,65, ,11/2/2009,Cipro hc
19, 5, UTI,None,This stuff is sooooooo much better than bactrim. I can't believe they prescribed me that crap. Thank you_ cipro. You aren't a monster drug like the sulfa drug that sent me to the ER.

21, 4, UTI,On Day 3 of 5-day cycle and only side effect has been noticeable fatigue.  Fatigue hasn't been so bad that I can't safely operate a vehicle_ but I do nap/sleep with ease and don't have a lot of energy.  But feeling tired is certainly better than the UTI symptoms_ which have improved significantly.,,F,45,3  days,8/11/2009,Cipro hc

25, 5, otiis externa,None_ but I did have more lucid dreams.,Most of the comments here are from people who did not take this preparation (they are confusing it with Cipro tablets) so should be discounted (though their experiences with the systemic use of Cipro tablets may be valid). This is a topical eardrop preparation of ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone for external ear infections and is a godsend for divers and surfers.,M,56,5  days,3/19/2009,Cipro hc
26, 3, UTI and Kidney infection,CRAZINESS! I lost my mind_ I thoght about mass murder_ killing people_ my head was gone! I took a total of 34 pills . 2 pills a day for 16.5 days.  I WILL NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE EVER again. IT DID help with the infection but damn _ the side effects are insane. If your infected you will feel relief in a day or 2_ atleast I did.. but the tiredness and absolutely NO energy level is still with me. My Main side effects were thisVERY tired (and I have a hyper thyroid)somewhat nausiated_ never vomited from it though. Very decreased appetite and increased indigestion. Very mentaly disturbed and hopeless feeling about 3 days into the run. If you start to feel crazy_ literaly_ its probly just the cipro. The madness in my mind has gone away but my stomach still hurts.,"Knowing what I know now_ after researching this some what_ I am not a doctor at all..... I wouldnt take this again and I would askfor somthing that ""seems"" safer from what I have read but like I said I am not a doc or a pharmacist...Id ask for keflex. Never cipro. The US military has stock piles of cypro because it kills ANTHRAX. now that is some strong stuff. I just had a UTI and kidney infection....not anthrax. They also use this to help fight the HIV virus. Im greatful that I feel better but am worried of these side effects after the fact. I read where_ if you take it for 3-4 days_ youll neeed a day or 2 of rest afterword. if you take it for a week_ thats 2 days of rest 2 weeks is 3 days 3 weeks is 4 days and so on. I learned this from a body building site where these idiots were using steroids_ injecting them and then using cipro to fight the injection site infection WHILE WORKING OUT. can we say STOOOOOPID?",M,35,17  days,3/13/2009,Cipro hc

We'll see.",F,50,1.5  days,2/6/2009,Cipro hc
28, 5, Severe UTI,No side effects_ just lots of relief!,I am so happy to finally be relieved of such severe pain.  Have suffered from bladder infections off and on for over 20 years.  This is a miracle drug for me!

29, 1, UTI_ Prostatitis,Severe nausea with very slow digestion_ fatigue_ dizziness_ foggy thinking_ stomach pain.,"Back in 1990_ I was diagnosed with gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying with nausea and vomiting of undigested food) after taking Cipro for weeks for Prostatitis. I have suffered with these symptoms with some improvement along with food allergies and severe spinal degradation since I first took Cipro. I never made the connection until recently when I again took Cipro for two weeks for a UTI. The same gastrointestinal symptoms returned and I immediately stopped taking the medication. I will warn anyone who reads this that these gastrointestinal symptoms from Cipro can be permanent as they are in my case. I also believe that Cipro may permanently effect the production of stomach acid. Acid blocking drugs(Nexium)also cause my digestive symptoms to get worse. I use probiotics_ betaine HCL and licorice to control my digestive symptoms. Weak solutions of vinegar or lemon juice sipped at mealtime also can help. If a weak solution of vinegar (2 tsp/4 oz.) eliminates your ""heartburn""",M,50,2  weeks,6/11/2008Email,Cipro hc
30, 5, UTI_ vaginal infection,None.,I have taken Cipro twice: Once it was for a UTI.  Another time it was for a bacterial vaginal infection (I had excessive discharge).  In both cases_ it worked FAST.  I felt relief from the Cipro in almost 24 hours.  The Cipro was prescribed for me when Macrobid did not work.  I thought it was a great drug.  Sorry I don't remember the dosages_ since it was about 3 years ago.,F,46,1  weeks,5/24/2008,Cipro hc
31, 1, UTI,Anxiety_ burning of the lining of the digestive tract_ stifness and joint pain_ loss of ability to think clearly_ spaciness_ and food allergies_ insomnia_ depression,Really nasty stuff - do not take if possible. I took Cipro 12 years ago for an UTI. It cleared up the UTI within 10 days. However_ I immediately lost the ability to digest food properly because this drug dilapidated my digestive tract: leaky gut syndrome_ allergies to nearly all foods and having to live in constant pain and severe digestive distress are a few permanent side effect of this drug. Cipro caused such an imbalance in my system that I ended up having a hysterectomy_ malfunctioning thyroid_ joint pain_ and severe weight gain right after I took this drug. Before I took Cipro I was very healthy and thin. Naturopathic care has helped with the joint pain and thyroid issues but the digestive issues are permanent. I am blown away there are posts on this site that claim to have had no side effects from this drug.,F,48,10  days,4/13/2008,Cipro hc
