1, 3, atrial fib,My husband was taken off nitro patches and put on this drug.  We don't know if this is the drug that has been causig low-grade constant headaches orr if it's a combo of this plus xarelto and aricept_ or if the cause is one of the these other drugs.  Has anyone else had headaches from this drug?  Also_ ringing in the ears and low energy.,,M,73,4  months120mg 1X D,2/9/2013Email,Diltiazem hcl

4, 3, fast heart rate with swollen glands,Hot Face Flushing& VERY COLD stinging sensations in lower trunk and my thighs kept me from sleep. Low grade fever persisted even though a throat culture was negative. After 3 wks. itchy and had light rash_ began shallow quick breathing for a few minutes a day. Felt wired! So far_ not good management of HighBP_since it causes fever which raises BP and I still feel unwell.  But_it dropped heart rate 96 points. (I don't have heart disease.) I hope there aren't Sulfites in these tabs_as I'm allergic to Sulfites.,My doctor introduces new BP meds when I'm sick with bronchitis_ the flu etc. Of course_ BP is higher when one has inflammation and fever!  So I suffer double.  Plus BP meds can CAUSE a fever so who knows if med is working?  I tried to go upto 120 mg. tabs 2XDAY of Diltiazem for 4 days for even better BP control. I had mild headaches. I GOT TOO DIZZY! I couldn't take a dish out of a sink and put it in a cabinet. (I might try a 90mg. tab 1xDay and skip the bedtime dose_ just to have BPlowered somewhat.),F,50,28  days90 2X D,3/6/2011,Diltiazem hcl

6, 4, atrial flutter_ atrialfib_tachacard,I felt for a while a bit down_ not actually depressed_ it has been the true drug for the firewall I need_ as I can break out to a 210 heart rate on a dime even with this pacemaker in. I have post open heart surgical nerve and rhythm damage and am grateful for this drug keeping me going. it is much better than other calcium channel blockers as one I took had me nosedive into this dark place which scared my big mind and upset me that I wasnt forewarned about the horrific side effects of some of these drugs. I take some nerve meds so I find it is best to take cardizem at nighttime and it has the least noticeable affects then. I tried to take a lower dose for a bit 120cd and went into atrial fib at the store..208 rate and counting..I just cant stand having an abnormal heart rate..so I will take the pill if it works.,I would try different doses if your having problems as there is no one drug that anyone could agree on and I would also experiment as to the time of day you take it. I like later at bedtime and it seems to be much more tolerable. I of course would always prefer no drug...but thats not going to happen,F,53,3  years,5/20/2007,Diltiazem hcl
