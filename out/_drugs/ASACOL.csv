5, 4, UC,None_ I've felt fine.,This cleared me right up after having issues for a year. Now I'm nervous because of all the bad reviews.  I never liked taking so many pills but my Dr. Always said it was like putting a bandaid on a sore.. And it didn't get absorbed into the blood so it was fine to take.

6, 3, Crohns/Colitis,"Took about 5 months for my body to adjust to the Asacol after having been on Sulfazine EC for nearly 20 years.  Since Jan. of 2015_ have passed 20 kidney stones and all appear to be directly related to the Asacol and not diet related.  After having an ""all-clear"" with both kidneys on 5/28/15_ passed two 7mm stones on 7/2/15 and 7/17/15.  They are being formed way too quick to be from any other source.",My Crohns has been moderate_ but meeting with Doctor to switch back to Sulfazine EC.  Visits to ERs to help with kidney stones is not worth it as I'm not any better on Asacol than on Sulfazine and symptons aren't bad enough for Humira.,M,52,22  months800 MG x 2 2X D,7/28/2015Email,Asacol

One day for whatever reason my doctor gave me some saline washes to use (1994) with-in one week i stopped going to the toilet_ i.e. i didn't wake up needing the loo.....it was like a mircle. Can't imagine the feeling. I'm writing this now because i've just had a flare up. I'm going to try the same thing again as I'm pretty sure that these washes cleared me up last time.

15, 1, colitis,,My name is Michael Sipusic.  I was notified by my prescription company that a RX I have been taking since 1993 is being discontinued mid April.  Reason stated is because the medicine has DBP in it.  The drug is Asacol used to treat colitis.  DBP is known to cause thyroid cancer I read.  In December 2007 I was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer after taking Asacol for 14 years.  Thyroid cancer in males is rare.  Even though the drug is discontinued...the drug manufacturer has not made any statements on their website and it looks like business as normal for them.  This drug was slated to go generic this year and I fell they are holding off on the negative news because it will impact their stock price significantly.  On top of all that...I believe this drug contributed to my thyroid cancer.Please see attached documents and information below.DBP was added to the California Proposition 65 (1986) list of suspected teratogens in November 2006. It is a suspected endocrine disruptor. It was used in some nail polishes; all major producers began eliminating this chemical from nail polishes in the Fall of 2006.DBP was permanently banned in children's toys and childcare articles_ in concentrations of 1000 ppm or greater_ under section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA).Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with the endocrine (or hormone system) in animals_ including humans.

17, 1, Ulcerative proctitis,Fatigue_ irritability_ anxiousness_ insomnia.,I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Proctitis in my teens. It went in remission when I picked up smoking. I quit 6 months ago and started taking Asocol . Doctors don't believe me_ but this medicine keeps me awake at night_ insomnia_ fatigue_ and extremely anxious. I tested my theory that it may be the Asocol_ by taking it every other day to see if I notice a different in sleep pattern or anxiousness_ and irritability. It is indeed the medicine. In between periods of not taking Asacol_ I felt fine-- and have no sleep disturbances. However_ symptoms of my UC subside greatly when using this medicine. I dislike the side effects_ but the medicine itself is every effective.,F,33,2  months500 MG 1X D,3/1/2013Email,Asacol

19, 1, ulcerative colitis,My daughter who is now 15_ was on asacol for her UC.  When she was first put on it_ it seemed to be fine.  She started to gain a large amount of weight and started to experience severe headaches.  She had a MRI thinking she had a brain tumor_ and nothing.  She decided she was done with the meds and refused to take them_ and the headaches went away.  I am not 100% it was the asacol_ but seems to be a connection.  I see that headaches have been mentioned on this site as well.  Her UC really didn't get any better either taking this medication.  She missed 35 days of school last year_ as she couldn't get out of bed due to her headaches and would sit there an cry.

22, 5, ulcerative colitis,It usually will quell a flare-up of colitis by taking 2 400 mg pills twice daily.  This time_ however_ I've had to take it three times daily_ and it seems to have gotten a handle on the UC but more slowly than norma.  I am very impressed and grateful for this drug.  The only thing I have noticed_ and I don't remember noticing this before (when on lower dose) is that I have a remarkable amount of gas.  And what is worse is that during a flare-up of UC I experience gas pains -- so a drug that causes me to have MORE gas is obviously a problem.  Also_ the drug is horrendously expensive.  I thought my insurance would cover it but the pharmacist gave my 3 months worth and said insurance wouldn't cover it_ and the bill was $1_200.00  I'm thinking of buying it online where the prices are just a tiny fraction o that. Can I do that?,,M,52,4  weeks400 MG,4/24/2012Email,Asacol

28, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,NO side effects -- except that during my third flare_ when we couldn't get the diarrhea under control using both prednisone and Asacol_ it turned out that the Asacol was actually causing the diarrhea. So now it will have to be a crap shoot - who knows whether it will be a silver bullet_ ending the diarrhea_ cramping and pain and giving me back my life_ or something that keeps me stuck at home_ unable to risk moving far from the john.,I took 4.8 G / day_ divided into either 2 or 3 doses_ my choice.During my first bout with Ulcerative Colitis_ Asacol was a miracle in a bottle - it completely stopped the endless cramping and diarrhea. I took the full dosage (12 - 400mg tabs/day) for several months_ then tapered off very slowly and maintained remission for three years. I had a flare_ went right back on Asacol and voila! nearly instant remission. Again_ tapered off after taking it for a couple of months_ but remission was short-lived.Now for the bad news:  the next flare_ the symptoms were only marginally controlled_ even though I was taking both prednisone and Asacol. I was getting desperate_ and finally_ my GI suggested that I stop the Asacol_ which apparently sometimes causes diarrhea.  To my shock_ within a day or two_ the diarrhea stopped. Unfortunately_ I have not stayed symptom-free_ and 4 months later I am still on prednisone and struggling to get control of this disease.Bottom line:  when it worked_ it was like a miracle drug. How ironic that it then began to cause the very symptoms it had been surpressing! I wish I could find something else as good.I had no other side effects. No nausea_ no hair loss_ or anything like that. So the question each time I flare will be:  does it work_ or does it make things worse? And that will be determined by trial and error.,F,55, 4.8 G 1X D,9/12/2011Email,Asacol
29, 2, Crohns,Possible cause of gout.,A lot of the common side effects of Asacol are what I had before I started taking it_ and they largely persisted. However_ a year after going on it_ in despair in a bad patch of gut problem_ I started seeing a medical herbalist and he improved matters greatly. I now have developed gout_ in the complete absence of the usual culprits such as red wine and red meat_ and have found it listed as a side effect. The herbalist switched to concentrating on the gout and the gut symptoms are much worse - which leads me to think that Asacol hasn't helped as much as the herbalist and has probably given me gout. Herbalist is back on the gut thing and I'm going to come off the Asacol. It seemed to help a bit but has apparently been outdone by natural remedies.,F,64,3  years400 3X D,8/23/2011,Asacol

Also cramps began to travel up and induce nausea every time they hit.  Makes going to work miserable.  Can't eat until I get home.,I tried to understand how Asacol works and wonder if it is just too non-specific after I understood that it is designed to interfere with the production of a natural lipid based secretion called prostaglandins_ some of which cause inflammation but some of which also inhibit inflammation.  Here is a website that explains a little of that: http://www.raysahelian.com/prostaglandin.html  Thanks everyone for the heads up about the kidney failure and hair loss.

32, 2, Ulcerative Colitis,minor headaches/cramps/feverishness/nausea for a month (at most_ more like a couple weeks_ but spread out over a month),The first couple weeks I had a bit of the headache/feverish thing come and go sporadically but it wasn't too big of a deal in relative terms. Nausea passed after a week or so too and it was never bad enough to even make me go to the bathroom to try to throw up so it was reasonable_ I think. The only problem is the Asacol never did give me even a day or two of remission. In fact_ I went untreated for 10 years and just dealt with the annoyance of frequent_ liquid (but very quick) stools. Since I had a colonoscopy I've had a new kind of pain (12 months now_ non stop) like there's rocks or something shart in my anus. I was prescribed Asacol after the colonoscopy but things have never gotten any better_ they just changed a bit. I go to the bathroom less often_ but the cutting feeling when I go can be excrutiating! Even after a BM I can't walk or sit normally for hours without constantly adjusting my position like it's OCD. In public it's really hard to deal with. The pills are huge too_ so if I had to take any more than 4 a day I don't know how I'd carry them around and keep them private. Furthermore_ after a month or two of taking it regularly_ the capsules start coming out in your stool. My dr. said it's a good thing_ so long as the shells are empty because then you know that the medication is being released near the end of your GI system. Problem is I'm getting the feeling that broken shells that can survive a GI track probably do a number on sensitive tissue with the jagged ed,M,25,18  months1600 2X D,5/8/2011Email,Asacol

34, 2, collagenous colitis,diarrhea and gas,I was diagnosed with collagenous colitis 4 1/2 month ago. Six weeks ago I was put on Asacol after I called my doctor in desperation due to a weekend of non-stop liquid diarrhea...several mishaps where I did not get to the bathroom in time and I actually lost 4 pound in two days.  I was also put on a prednisone regime at the same time.  I seemed to improve for a few days and then things got bad again (although not as bad).  I recently noticed that one of the side effects of Asacol is diarrhea and gas.  I asked the doctor if the Asacol might be contributing to the problem.  He suggested that I stop taking it for awhile_ which I did three days ago.  This has been the best three days in four 1/2 months.  My stool is almost back to normal_ visiting the bathroom just twice in the morning_ and I feel well for the first time.  I am hoping that this turn around lasts.  I am on the prednisone for three more weeks.  We'll see...,F,66,6  weeks400 mg 6X D,4/11/2011Email,Asacol

My Dr. stated I was lactose intolerant.  Finally after 8 months I called and indicated I needed some relief. I had a colonoscopy and it was determined I had cologinous colitus.  I was put on Entecort for three months and added Asacol the last month.  I have had several flair ups since but went almost one year without any.

HAIR LOSS has been terrible - didn't think it might be ascol but has been getting worse over past 2 years. Had sig and upper Gi recently and dr said it was fine - am going to new dr. Old dr said all good and has ignored my nausea for over a year.  I am so frustrated.  The nausea and fatigue is worse in the morning and makes it hard to get going each day.  I have very restless sleep and have to take ativan to sleep. My UC did have surface after quitting smoking and I had very severe attack - in 08 spent week on hosp,F,39,2  years3 pill 3X D,10/25/2010,Asacol

55, 5, proctitis/diverticulitis,fatigue. but being my age I cannot blame asacol for that I think_,although I am newcomer using this drug it has worked really well so far and all the problems that have been described by so many people on this site did apply to me for eight months_ I was admitted to hospital eventually allowed home and used Predfoam canister to inject into the rectum_ followed by Asacol canister after two months on Predfoam_At the same time using these injected foams I was taking Asacol at 3200mg per day which I can only say have greatly eliminated bleeding_gas_diarhea etc but during this eight month flare up I have lost 8.5 kilograms. at the moment I do not eat as much as i used to or any junk food at all so I hope to stay at a non obese level of weight which is well within the safe weight area for my bodies build.I have other health problems like angina and C.O P D but reaching 74 I cant complain but I want to wish all sufferers my best wishe to all of them and hopefully they will get relief somehow for all their suffering.,M,74,3  months800 3X D,9/29/2010Email,Asacol

59, 2, UC,Have been taking drug for 4 months now_ having been diagnosed this April with UC.  Was hospitalized for 11 days.  Was on Prednisone_ but have tappered off.  Started off with 3-400mg asacol tablets three times day. Now only taking 2-400mg tablets two times a day.  Since diagnosis have had body aches_ hard to walk_ especially after just getting up.  Lots of hair loss.  Acne/bumps over body_ which have just recently spread to top of forehead.  Dropping dosage hasn't seemed to change symptoms.  Not sure if symptoms are because of the asacol or UC itself. Interest said bowel diseases can host a lot of other problem in our bodies.  Not sure if asacol is that helpful.  If it's keeping the inflammation down_ then I'm sure it will be helpful in the long run.,,F,44,4  months800mg 2X D,9/10/2010,Asacol
