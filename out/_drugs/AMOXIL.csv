0, 2, Root canal infection,Weight gain_ weight gain and more gain. Two pounds of water weight already. I thought it was  my scale out-of-whack but after googling the subject of weight gain with antibiotics_ there were many hits. I understand that once you quit a course of treatment_ the weight loss is a lot slower than the weight gain. I have 3 more days to go and hopefully I will my procedure by then and won't have to take it anymore.,I had no other side effects so that's why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. It prevented further infection and kept away the potential for fever and swelling,F,64,4  days500 mg,7/25/2016Email,Amoxil
1, 3, Abscessed tooth,I'm on day 4. Have some dizziness_ diarrhea_ and feel pretty much exhausted. All three side effects started today.,Amoxicillin started to work within 24 hours. I don't enjoy the side effects but would take it again. It has been my experience that no antibiotic is all that pleasant to take.Dosing is one every 6 hours.,M,62, 500mg 3X D,6/14/2016,Amoxil
2, 3, Pneomonitis,Mostly depression with exhaustion. I began to feel hopeless with mild anxiety which is not normal to me at all ... I was actually relieved to read that others have reported the same thing. I have mild nausea also ...,It seems to be a necessary drug but I would not choose to be on it long term ... it also concerns me to think how it might affect children ... ?,F,62,5  days250mg,10/7/2015,Amoxil
3, 3, Helicobacter pylori infection,Nausea_ abdominal pain_ spasms during the night (which further caused sleeplessness)_ skin rashes_ dry mouth,I was prescribed the Nextium hp7 which contains amoxicillin to kill the H. Pylori (in my stomach). 5-6days after taking the pills_ things started to go downturn_ with unpleasant new symptoms poping up one after another_ after day-8_ it went bizzare - I was feeling so sick that I thought there were something seriously wrong with my liver or bile or pancreas - I finished the course anyway_ as the instruction says if I don't follow the exact dosage the bacteria will become more difficult to wipe out later.,F,44,10  days2x2x500mg,8/15/2015,Amoxil
4, 3, Root Canal_ possible infection,Cloudy head_ confusion_ difficulty focusing_ forgetfulness_ lethargy_ insomnia_ weird mood swings_ short term memory problems_  bizarre/disturbing dreams_ tongue rash/bumps_ tongue sensitivity. Low appetite_ lots of headaches_ forgetfulness_ &things taste weird.**All of these are to an extreme degree & interfering with everyday life.**,I was starting to think I was crazy since none of the official medicine thingies really mention the symptoms I have been having. I'm on day 6 of a 7-day regimen; will probably go ahead and finish & hope I start feeling more clear-headed & even-keeled soon. I can't remember if I mentioned it_ but forgetfulness. :-)Seriously though_ the symptoms are almost as bad as the infection. Not as bad_ but extremely frustrating and scary.,F,40,6  days500 3X D,4/20/2015Email,Amoxil

8, 5, Severe Sinus Infection,Slght muscle cramp_ dehydration_ nausea if taken without food_ upset stomach_ occasional dry mouth. Took this to clear a sinus infection. Was prescribed a prescription for 10 days. I was only able to take it for seven due to the side effects mentioned previously. Outside of the side effects it did exactly what it's suppose to do. While taking this make sure you drink plenty of water through out the day!,,M,47,10  days1000mg,10/17/2014,Amoxil

11, 5, dental abscess,Some fungal infection (tinea).,A good and safe drug for its intended use_ but keep an antifungal creme on hand_ since you may experience a tinea infection. Probiotics afterwards are a good idea_ as well.,M,40,10  days250 mg 3X D,5/25/2014Email,Amoxil

13, 4, Pre-medication for Dental appoimtme,I take Amoxicillin as a pre med before dentist appointments. I take 2000/mg one hour prior to my exam. I had a cleaning & crown scheduled within a 2 week period which means I took 2 2000/mg doses within that time. My side effects included adult acne on my forehead and a vaginal infection. I chose not to go to the doctor for the vaginal infection (I wanted to see if it would clear up on its own. It did within 5 days.). I am also immunosuppressed (transplant recipient_ which is why I am required to take the pre med). I usually don't have major issues with this drug_ however_ the vaginal issue was VERY unpleasant.,"Overall_ I can't complain. I was well when I took it (I take the medication to PREVENT an infection due to dental work). With taking large doses 14 days apart_ I can safely assume that was why the side effects were more severe (I am also a small woman: 5'1"" 110#). I am so thankful for this site. It has helped me pinpoint which medications are causing side effects. I don't feel that it's 'dramatic' to write an honest review of what is happening with your body. We are all different and have different reactions.",F,34,1  days2000 MG 1X D,4/16/2014,Amoxil
14, 5, double ear infection,This is the safest and one of the oldest antibiotics out there_ and thankfully my toddler tolerated it well with probiotics 5-6 hours after the morning dose.  Lots of water and coconut water!,,F,3.5,10  days,3/23/2013,Amoxil
15, 4, strep throat,nausea (which subsided after eating yogurt 3 hrs. after each dose)_ fatigue_ headache and back pain.,I've taken this med several times over the past two years for tooth infection avoidance without any negative side effects.  However_this time was totally different the fatigue and back pain were the worst and i almost didn't take my last five pills because of this.  The back pain started on the second day my doctor said to keep taking the meds_ by the fourth day i felt so bad that i started taking them every ten hours instead of every 8.  This eased the nausea and fatigue somewhat along with eating greek yogurt 2.5hrs. after each dose_ of course i had to take the meds longer but was able to function better.  I have become quite sensitive to antibiotics as i've gotten older. I will try natural alternatives next time.  of course they have their side effects too but not nearly as bad as prescribed meds._ and they get the job done naturally.,F,57,10  days500mg 3X D,2/20/2013,Amoxil

19, 5, Tooth Infection,No side effects_ I wish people would stop being so dramatic as other will people will get paranoid and aviod treating their infection!!,Amoxil is a fab antibiotic_ as with any antibiotic space them evenly_ every 6-8 hours_ eat with them as this will stop nausea or upset stomach and give them a chance to work. More than likely its the infection itself that is making you feel ill not the tablets!!!!,F,34,7  days500 3X D,10/17/2011Email,Amoxil

24, 4, Tooth Extraction/Infection,I took this with an OTC product I purchased called AZO YEAST - this contains probiotics which help with gastrointestinal problems and warding off yeast infections_ the dose I took was more than recommended on the AZO Yeast Box_ but I have taken this before with antibiotics with good results_ Take 2 AZO yeast pills about 5 minutes before each dose of the antibiotic and had NO bad side affects. I do recommend the AZO Yeast as most of these penicillin based antibiotics give me yeast infections.,I clench my jaws and i had to have the extractions on teeth I had root canals on because I cracked the roots right along the gumline and the root canals become unsealed and infected... ugh... This medicine worked well but I went back because I still had some pain and swelling in my check and the oral surgeon now gave me Augmentin 875 2 x's a day - I go back on Friday because we haven't ruled out the fact that it could be another tooth abscessed!!,F,37,7  days875 2X D,5/12/2010,Amoxil

The pain subsided once I went to bed_ but the next day_ by the end of the day_ the pain had returned.,,F,50,7  days500 3X D,5/6/2010Email,Amoxil
27, 5, Tooth and Jaw infection,I have a severe anxiety disorder and depersonalization disorder.  All I can say is thank God for Amoxicillin_ it's the only anti-biotic I can take.  Most other anti-biotics actually have side effects that can really screw people's heads up... racing heart_ anxiety_ mood swings_ bad dreams.  Amoxil does none of these to me.  Again_ thank GOD for Amoxil.,,M,32,7  days1500 mg 3X D,4/7/2010Email,Amoxil
28, 1, ear infection,Extreme stomach pain_ indigestion and nausea - worse each time she took it - last dose I was ready to take her to the ER,My daughter took this in November.  She had a total of 4 doses.  Ever since taking this drug she has had trouble with her stomach. Reflux_ constipation and food sensitivities. I have taken her to an ENT and a GI.  They can find nothing wrong with her.  I think it was from the Amoxil.  Anybody else out there have a similar reaction?  The doctors prescribed an adult dose of Prilosec for her symptoms_ which after reading this site_ she will not be taking.  I've got her taking probiotics and really watching her diet - hopefully it will fix itself soon.,F,10,4  days 2X D,2/20/2010Email,Amoxil

32, 5, bronchitis,I took the liquid form_ so I got thrush_ but it was easily cured with Nystatin. Otherwise_ I had no side effects.,I had terrible bronchitis for weeks_ as I was scared to take anything for it.  The Amoxicillin cured me in several days.

33, 1, strep throat,No side effects_ but it doesn't kill strep!,My son has taken this drug several times in the past for strep throat_ and years ago it used to work.  But this time_ after the full 10 days on it_ the strep returned a few weeks later...in his anus!  (I'm not joking here.) He got this itchy rash that kept him up at night and hurt when he went to the bathroom.  After several trips to the perplexed doc_ she finally did a swab test (down there) and found out he was positive for strep in his anus.  Augmentin worked this time.  I wouldn't trust amoxicillan for strep any more!,M,11,10  days,4/11/2009,Amoxil
