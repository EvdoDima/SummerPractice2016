2, 1, Migraine,I had panic attacks and heart palpitations.,I was given this med for headaches. My heart rate shot up from 78 to 191. I thought i was having a heart attack. I could not yell out because i was too weak. So i started to pray. I felt stuck like it was never going to stop!!! The nurse had to give me adivan to calm me down. The nurse had to sit by my bed side to monitor my heart rate. It never went back to 78 it stayed in the 90's. This is the worst feeling ever id rather feel pain. Please take this med and get rid of it before it claims someones life. This happened 2 weeks ago and im still a nervous wreck!

6, 1, Nausea and vomiting,Ten minutes after getting an IV dose of this med_ I felt like I was going nuts. My skin was crawling_ I had very bad panic_ and I was close to pulling my IV out and leaving the ER. This was absolutely the WORST physical feeling I have ever had...mind you_ I've given birth and had multiple surgeries. Stay away!

7, 1, Neasea,Well I was taking compazine because I kept vomitting after  my wisdom teeth removal. Well turns out I'm in the 2% of people allergic to it. I had severe dystonia_ my lip and jaw drooped_ I looked like I was having a stroke. My teeth would not unclench and the worst was my neck muscles were out of control and I looked like I was the exorcist. Scariest experience of my life. I couldn't stop looking up. Thank god they gave me iv Benadryl and my neck finally went back to normal,,F,21,1  days,6/29/2016,Compazine
8, 1, Nausea from stomach flu,Jittery_ anxious_ angry_ restless_ muscle spasms_ profuse sweating. I was given this garbage via IV for nausea in the emergency room due to me losing 10 pounds from vomiting/diarrhea from the stomach flu. After about 5 minutes I noticed that my legs wanted to kick and they began cramping. I started sweating and I wanted to start punching people and rip out my IV and start running as far away from the hospital as I can (even though I drove lol.) I started to calm down about 20 minutes later and when the nurse came back I asked her why I reacted like that and she said that it happens with some people. The doctor gave me a script of this crap (which I will never fill_) I'll just stick to Pepto Bismol. Avoid this medicine.,Don't ever take this shit. Ever.,M,32,1  times,6/19/2016,Compazine
9, 1, As a part of migraine protocol,"Restlessness_ muscle aches_ extreme discomfort_ the feeling of wanting to ""crawl out of my skin"".",I received this drug as a part of migraine protocol IV cocktail (Benadryl/Compazine/Dexamethasone) in emergency room after experiencing 3-day long severe migraine bout. Immediately after the IV push I experienced the feeling of restlessness and muscle cramps similar in sensation to what happens during rising fever. It felt as if anything touching my skin was giving me the feeling of great discomfort and irritation (clothing_ blanket). I realized that it might be a reaction to one of the medications in the cocktail but wanted to give them a chance to work anyway and did not alert the nurse. The cocktail worked in the sense that it broke my migraine but even 2 days later I'm still experiencing same side effects of restlessness and muscle cramps_ although diminished. Just waiting for Compazine to leave my system at this point.,F,43,1  days10mg 1X D,6/3/2016Email,Compazine

I went home and although my headache was gone I still felt dizzy and anxious. I had a panic attack and had to go back to the ER. They gave me an IV to try and flush my system. I went home. The next day I still felt dizzy and drowsy. I went to the doctor and they gave me a medicine to control the dizziness. They said the compazine would just have to run its course. This is day three and I'm still having trouble sleeping_ dizziness_ and anxious feelings. I'm hoping it wears off soon.,I would not recommend anyone taking this drug!!!!

18, 1, Dizziness - moderate vertigo,Increased dizziness_ felt worse than before. Dry mouth_ anxiety_ tiredness/fatigue_ just wanted to sleep_ didn't want to do anything. Disturbed sleep_ woke up in night and couldn't get back to sleep,Prescribed Stemitil - Prochlorperazine maleate 5mg three times a day for vertigo. Dipping and swaying feeling_ not spinning sensation but feeling off balance_ even sitting still. I woke up with it one morning. Doctor tested me for Epley maneuver but said it wasn't crystals inside ear canal. I suggested Stemitil because it worked for me 30 yrs ago when I had extreme dizziness and nausea from a damaged inner ear after a road traffic accident. Ive had dizzy spells come and go over the years from my ear damage. I haven't had dizziness for many years so I thought the tablets would help me like they used to_ but now I am menopausal and my body has changed. I only took them for 3 days but the dizziness got much worse so on day 4 I stopped taking them. I felt anxiety_ dry mouth_ exausted_ and more dizzy. After researching online I am now trying sublingual under tongue methylcobalamine vitamin B12 high dose but I need to try it for a few weeks to find out if this will help reduce my vertigo.,F,56,3  days5mg 3X D,3/11/2016,Compazine

21, 1, nausea,My husband was given IV Compazine for nausea. Almost immediately he became severely anxious_ and his heart rate rapidly increased and he began sweating. He is not an anxious person and this was extremely out of character. He told me he felt like he was going to die and begged me to help him! He also had feelings of paranoia that he's never had before. The nurse gave him some Ativan to counteract the results and he was able to get calmed down slightly. However_ now 2-3 weeks later he has been up several times in the night still experiencing the same side effects. He never experienced this prior to taking Compazine! DO NOT Take this medication!,,M,43,1  days 1X AN,2/21/2016,Compazine
22, 1, Stomach virus. (5 days),While not being able to hold down any food for days_....my stomach started hurting very bad.  I couldn't take the stomach pain anymore.   Called mom to take me to the E.R.  I know I lost 10 lbs that week_ and shouldn't have waited THAT long!   I was admitted & they gave me some phenegran thru I.V.  My stomach was still hurting very bad_...it didn't help at all.   They then gave me this horrid Benedryl/Compazine cocktail.   The next thing I knew I felt like I was suddenly going to die.  I wanted to rip my I.V. out right then and there.  I thought about it_ and didn't say anything to mom or the nurses_....but nothing but bad thoughts entered into my mind.   I couldn't stop thinking about taking that I.V. out myself though.  I'd never experienced anything even close to this before.  I dealt with it on my own_ was released from the hospital as it did eventually work_ & the bag of I.V. fluids did help as well.   .......was then dropped off at my house and continued thinking/feeling,,M,33, ? 1X H,2/1/2016Email,Compazine
23, 1, Migraine and nausea,"I was given a cocktail of benadryl then compazine and fluids due to a migraine I had for 2 weeks. At first I thought the crazy feeling was just me as I deal with anxiety anyway. In the next week I experienced random attacks of impending doom_ like I was going to die. WORST feeling ever! I ended up back in the ER shortly after (still had migraine/nausea) and was given same cocktail. I wanted to rip out my iv and run. I knew then it was from the compezine. The only thing that kept me there was knowing I was getting a dose of valuim (which hardly helped the impending doom feeling) for my brain MRI. After reading these comments I regret not telling the nurse right away how I was feeling. Other than the impending doom I also felt trapped_ like I was never going to leave that hospital room. I was so tired and wanted to sleep but felt like I would never wake up if I did. The ""cocktail"" did make me feel better temperaily but I can't say that it was worth it. I would rather stay puking my guts out with a pounding migraine then feel like that ever again!",I suggest you please tell your nurse or doctor right away if you have any negative symptoms of compazine!,F,,1  days,1/9/2016,Compazine
24, 1, Severe Migraine,Extreme anxiety for entire 48 hrs Panic attacks + shakiness Insomnia Difficulty breathing,Dear hospitals_ PLEASE for the love of God STOP giving this POISON to your patients! I was given this garbage for a severe migraine and within seconds I was shaking like crazy and I had the worst anxiety of my life for 2 whole days. I couldn't even sleep it off because it was preventing me from sleeping and at one point I was even having trouble breathing. It didn't even work for the pain I was in_ it only made me feel like I was going out of my mind. To make matters worse_ the nurse gave it to me even when I asked her not to_ and then told me to stop freaking out while I was having a panic attack. Always make sure that you ask your doctor or nurse what they are about to give you. Don't let yourself or your loved ones get injected with this panic poison!!!,F,23,1  days10,1/8/2016,Compazine
25, 1, Concussion,I wouldn't wish this drug on my worst enemies. I've never been suicidal in my life before this. It's been over 72 hours since they shot me up with it in the ER_ and I'm still not focusing the same. I'm listless in my desires_ but man_ I couldn't even sit still. I looked like I was crazy. The only thing that's helped is Klonopin.,,F,26,1  days5mg/mlx100 1X D,1/6/2016Email,Compazine
26, 1, Nausea/vomiting,I was young_ 12 or 13. Was given a shot in the buttocks at the ER. That was the most painful injection I have ever had in my life. 24 hours later I could not relax my stomach muscles and began feeling jittery like I had to run away. My mother took me to the clinic and while sitting in the waiting room my mouth turned into a grimace and my tongue protruded out_ heart was racing. They rushed me to an exam room and while lying on the table my back arched to the point that the only thing touching the table was the top/back of my head and my heels. My tongue came out and curled down my chin. I remember the Doc coming in and ordering the nurse to get Benadryl shots stat! After the B shots(s) I was able to relax and felt better after a few days.,Prior to this reaction_ I was very outgoing_ loved to get up in front of the class to read my stories_ do speeches or just clown around. Afterwords I was withdrawn_ anxious and started suffering panic attacks. The rest of junior high and high school was hell! That was in the late 70's so you didn't talk about your fears. There are no panic disorders or any other type of mental illnesses running in my family so I just suffered for years until seeing a shrink and getting on some mild meds around 1999 or so. After reading all the experiences of others_ I am convinced this drug affected a big part of my life. My anxiety was so severe it kept me from furthering my education. The good news is_ it does get easier over time and I never ever had a desire to do drugs because after that reaction it took several years for anyone to even get me to swallow an aspirin. LOL! I noticed on some of the comments that people have a desire to correspond with others about their experience. I would be very interested in that myself and am leaving email address. I f this drug is still available_ do not take it!,M,53,1  timesUnsure 1X O,12/8/2015Email,Compazine

Went to EC last weekend after fiorecet and phenergan failed and I was vomiting green bile and drooling. The IV compazine_ benadryl_ toradol_ steroid cocktail worked immediately. I did experience the flight stage and wanted my IV out. However_ it ended the pain_ nothing else mattered. I fought the irritability and went to sleep. I could not work or drive the next day. After that I was fine. I take the oral form of compazine now with benadryl and pain meds for migraine and it's working so far. Good luck to all you other migraine sufferers. I pray for us all to be pain-free.,Careful with IV use,F,32,7  days10mg,11/7/2015,Compazine
28, 1, migraine,I have to say that I know now that giving someone compazine IV without pretreating them with a beta-blocker and ativan is just asking for trouble. Unfortunately_ at the time I didn't know and sadly they usually don't tell you what they are giving you. Some doctors absolutely refuse to treat anything but obvious pain (broken bone_ bad burn..etc) with opiates. It turned out I was given a large push of straight compazine and about the same time the nurse left I started feeling burning and jitters. I then felt waves of tingling coursing up my body. I started to feel restless and anxious as if something bad was happening and then I started to cry. I don't know why but I just knew I must be having a reaction to the medicine and that I could very well die. I slammed the emergency button and the nurse came in and said it was just normal side effects. ?? wtf_ I was freaking out and going out of my mind but how can you relate that? I now know I did have a reaction but that it precipitated an anx,Terrible drug_ I know it has it's uses and if given orally or as a injection into the arm or butt that cuts down on the side effects a lot_ but just hearing that drugs name scares the crap out of me.,M,50,1  days? 1X D,8/23/2015,Compazine

I felt like I needed to get out of the hospital immediately_ like I was trapped and was never going to get to leave. I became extremely agitated and demanded that the nurses remove my IV so I could leave. I thought once I got home_ the anxiety would be gone. I was wrong. I was anxious the rest of the evening along with feeling foggy_ disconnected and having thoughts that nothing would ever be okay again. It has been 24 hours since the IV dose_ and I still feel very anxious and disconnected.I would tell anyone to NEVER take this drug.

39, 1, Migraine,This drug is HORRENDOUS! I was told that any side effects would last only a few hours after leaving. The side effect of this medication were worse than the migraine. It took 48 hours for the effects to diminish. Within 10 mins.of it being administered I was restless_ fidgety and exhausted at the same time (which is a terrible combo). Once I got home (which by the grace of God_ I was able to drive myself home...which I should not have been allowed to do) I couldn't sleep_ yet was too groggy to stay up. I lost my appetite and urinated incessantly! I mean I must have peed every 1 1/2 hrs. It stunk really bad too...for about 3 or 4 days. I had jaw clenching that was so bad that my jaw was sore for almost 4-5 days after the injection wore off. I took about a week for the restlessness to dissipate. Still having trouble sleeping almost 3 weeks later!  After the 48 hour period...the migraine came back for almost two more days!I am a spiritual person and believe that life events can shape us,This drug SUCKS!,F,,1  daysIDK 1X O,4/9/2015,Compazine

Went to ER to just find some relief to get comfortable_ COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE!! 1ST time I had this cocktail. I already suffer from panic attacks_ especially with any morphine/opiates. Within 5 min of the IV cocktail- full blown panic attack. Crawling out of my skin to get up and walk around- in way too much pain to do it. After lying there for another few minutes felt like a heart attack was coming_just wanted to get out of there and get that IV out of me.

By the third day I had convinced myself I was loosing it. I had social anxiety symptoms_ the feeling I needed to get out of the room I was in and then just keep ""escaping"" is the best way I can describe it. I couldn't function because I was so agitated_ insisting on leaving (which I finally did by that evening)....just a bunch of different symptoms that were not easy to deal with. They finally gave me some Benadryl and then some Ativan to calm me down. I was being treated as though I was just a random crazy lady who was just f.ed up. They had psychiatry come talk to me (3 different drs at three different times) who all said there's nothing  wrong with your mental status at all....the medical team just needs something to blame your symptoms on and this time this won't work for them. I left AMA that evening & went to a different hospital for the rest of my inpatiet time. Once the compozine had been flushed from my system I was back to normal. I seriously would have slept on a bench in a park in a bad neighborhood next to a crazy homeless guy than to stay there one more second. My mind was on overdrive and rational thinking was non existe",,F,42,3  days30mg,4/2/2015,Compazine
44, 1, Migraine,I went to the E.R for my first ever migraine. Dear god_ do I regret it.I had a panic attack_ I was in hysterics_ I wanted to cry and scream but I couldn't even produce any tears. I didn't attempt to take out my IV_ but I know for a fact I wanted it out and I wanted to go home and rest. I tried to fall asleep on my hospital bed after I calmed down a half-hour later_ I couldn't go to sleep because I was too hyper vigilant of sounds. Then I started getting tremors.By the way_ this was in a cocktail with Benadryl and some other drug I can't remember_ but seeing all the reviews here made me think Compazine made me freak the fuck out.,,M,17,1  timesidk 1X D,4/1/2015,Compazine
45, 1, headaches due to viral meningitis,I was given this medication while in the hospital for viral meningitis. Gave me the worst anxiety attack of my life! I still have anxiety attacks from it.

It had been given to me in a 5 second period...,,F,28,1  times 1X D,3/29/2015,Compazine

48, 1, Migraine,This drug is horrible!!! I went to the ER because I was experiencing the worst migraine of my life.  Within 10 minutes of the compazine being administered through the IV I felt extremely restless. The nurse offered benadryl but I just wanted to go home at this point!! I was discharged then had to wait about 30 minutes outside for my ride because I couldn't drive. It helped the migraine but at the same time I was so out of my comfort zone. Once I got home I was still very restless. It was awful. I had no control over my body. Probably one of the worst days of my life.  Finally I took Motrin pm and passed out. Felt better the next day...  however it's nice to read that I wasn't the only one who had such a horrible experience.,,F,27,1  days,3/17/2015,Compazine
49, 1, migraine,My daughter who is 7 went to the hospital for a headache. They said it was a migraine and gave her compazine and benadryl. Immediately she started twitching and seemed to be breathing heavy. The nurse said she was fine and left the room. I had to run out and get her 10 seconds later because my daughter started freaking out_ screaming saying she needed to get up. As soon as the nurses got to the room she stopped breathing. They had to push on her chest and give her oxygen. I sat there watching in disbelief. I have never been so scared in my life. I thought i was losing my baby. This drug should be taken off the market,,F,7,1  daysdont know,3/17/2015Email,Compazine

52, 1, migraine,Went to er because a bad migraine and left wanting to blow my head off! It wasn't ten minutes after the doctor pumped it via iv I was raising hell wanting to leave_ threatening the doctor and completely out of my mind.

Then the frequent bathroom trips began_ I peed probably 35 times that night_ contemplated suicide all night also.. worse drug ever,If the us government wanted to torture someone_ just give them a shot of compazine...

54, 1, Migraine,Do not take this medication under ANY circumstances. I do not know why this is legal to administer to human beings. This medicine gave me the absolute worst experience of my life. I was restless_ anxious_ couldn't sit still_ the whole she-bang. I wanted to die. I begged one of the nurses to please kill me. Did it get rid of my headache? Yes. But you'll wish you just had a headache after you experience the side effects of this devil spawn from Satan's pharmaceutical company.,NEVER_ EVER_ UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES_ TAKE THIS MEDICINE. I am not joking. It will make you extremely suicidal if they do not have Cogentin on hand to reverse and placate the effects.,M,19,1  daysIV 1X AN,2/10/2015Email,Compazine

56, 1, Migraines with Nausea,I was given this after going to emergency with an extreme migraine_ which was causing nausea.  After receiving it via IV_ I had an incredible feeling of uneasiness and restlessness_ but couldn't keep my eyes open as well.  I would close my eyes and try to sleep_ but I felt like I had a heightened sense of awareness of every sound_ feel_ thought....but unable to keep my eyes open.  As soon as I was left alone_ I tore the IV out of my hand and sneaked out of the ER to my car.  My eyes felt so heavy driving_ that I pulled into a parking lot to sleep for a few minutes_ but I had the same feeling of wanting to scream at the top of my lungs and couldn't stay still_ but again_ couldn't keep my eyes open.  I was able to make it home_ but felt the same way the next morning.  I went to work and in a meeting_ I jumped out of my chair after 2 minutes and paced the hallway.  I remember telling myself time and time again_ that I now knew why people committed suicide.  I told myself that if these fee,,M,39,1  days 1X D,1/10/2015Email,Compazine

59, 4, Headache from TIA,I was given compazine with Benadryl  to help my headache. I was at the ER for a TIA (mini stroke). I had been begging for meds to help my headache since I arrived at the ER and was put in a room. The doctor could not give me narcotics because I was gonna be transferred to another hospital to have a work up. Anyway as soon as the nurse put the medicine in my IV my heart rate jumped in the 100s and my BP jumped to 168/138.  I started feeling tired and then it immediately stopped and I started getting so nervous. This feeling was crazy. I felt agitated and anxious. I started having and uncontrollable cry. I wanted to take off running and scream at the same time. I told the nurse that I wanted to go home and begged them to give me something to calm me down and the doctor said no I'm sorry we can't . So I signed papers to go home and needles to say today is the third day home and I'm still jittery and nervous. I can't sit still. I can't believe the doctor couldn't give me Ativan or something in my IV to calm me down. And on top of that I have a bad heart ( PFO) _ angina and high BP  so this definitely didn't help my BP and angina. I would definitely not recommend this combination for a headache while it did help my headache it did cause a weird reaction.,,F,45,1  days,12/20/2014,Compazine
