0, 1, URI coughing and rash,Pediatrician prescribed 5 day course for upper respiratory sx_ coughing and a rash that developed after taking azithromycin. After 1 dose of prednisone_ daughter experienced severe tightness and tingling in leg and tongue along with excessive thirst not relieved by drinking water. Also had extreme anxiety and emotional crying. Discontinued med. 4 days later still had extreme anxiety/panic and difficulty catching breath. Took to ER because she felt like she couldn't breathe and dr said could take as long as 6 weeks for sx to subside. Those who are super sensitive to meds should be cautious to take this. The side effects are bad and long lasting. Do not recommend as psychiatric effects are documented.,,F,14,1  days40 mg,1/11/2015,Prednisone intensol

10, 1, CD,"Hair loss_ acne_ major depression_ suicidal_ memory problems_ weight gain_ sexual side effects_ red eyes_ heart palpitations_ yellow skin...Go here to read what the Mayo Clinic has to say about the psychiatric effects of corticosteroids: mayoclinicproceedings.com/inside.asp?AID=4187&UID= Here are some excerpts: ""It is important that clinicians in all specialties become aware of the potential psychiatric adverse effects associated with corticosteroids and explain these effects to their patients.""""The corticosteroid dosage is the most important risk factor for the development of psychiatric symptoms."" ""Psychiatric disturbances can occur at any point during corticosteroid treatment_ including almost immediately after initiation and even after cessation of treatment."" ""Patients should be evaluated for any suggestion of suicidality."" ""Corticosteroid-induced psychiatric disturbances are common and include mania_ depression_ psyc","""Educating patients about potential adverse effects and asking about such effects at each patient encounter can enhance early intervention for adverse corticosteroid-induced psychiatric reactions."" ""Although a powerful therapeutic option_ corticosteroids are associated with serious adverse effects_ both physiologic and psychiatric."" ""In our literature review_ we found that the potential psychiatric adverse effects of corticosteroids span a symptom spectrum from subtle mood changes to full-blown affective syndromes and frank psychosis.""""Cognitive deficits_ particularly declarative or verbal memory deficits_ have been well documented during both long- and short-term corticosteroid therapy."" ""More severe cognitive impairment consistent with delirium or dementia has also been described.""",F,, ,9/27/2008,Prednisone intensol
11, 1, autoimmune disease,I was on a very high dose; I don't know anyone who's taken such high doses as I did. Side effects: Suicidal ideation_ depression_ bipolar disorder_ large acne cysts that scarred my skin_ weight gain_ thyroid disease_ rapid heart beat_ decreased healing ability; dry_ red eyes...too many to mention. In short_ it ruined my life.,If anyone tells you prednisone is safe_ don't believe them. I really wish I had been assigned a different doctor. When I became sick_ I was assigned someone_ Anne Sullivan_ whose medical interests supposedly are adolescents and chronic disease--and because I was an adolescent with a chronic disease_ I suspect that's why I was assigned this doctor. She told me prednisone was safe and not to worry about side effects; I believed her_ as I would've believed any doctor. I started experiencing side effects right away and the doctors denied them--and now they're permanent_ because they refused to treat them. Also: prednisone didn't help my disease at all. In fact_ just weeks later I was told I was going to die and my mom and I had to drive five hours all the way back to Iowa City_ to the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics_ to see my doctor. The reason why I_ a teenager_ was going to do_ however_ was related to the stupid advice my doctors in the hospital gave me_ not my disease. Basicall,F,, ,9/22/2008,Prednisone intensol
12, 1, Crohn's Disease,Prednisone gave me Cushing's Syndrome - which for guys means a lot of bad things_ like Erectile Dysfunction_ weight gain_ high blood pressure_ hypertension_ depression and anxiety_ thin_ fragile skin that bruises and scars easily; facial flushing; rounding of face; pink and purple stretch marks; slowed healing of cuts; infections and even insect bites; muscle weakness; and acne.,This stuff is worse than drinking battery acid. Good doctors use it only as a last resort because it is so terrible.,M,32,5  months,9/7/2008,Prednisone intensol

He said that prednisone's effects are long-lasting and you can't undo the damage. Even for the people who think they didn't have side effects_ they most likely did and still do. For example_ prednisone reduces your ability to heal for the rest of your life.,F,26,4  months,8/20/2008,Prednisone intensol

15, 1, UC,Severe depression. Suicidal. Attempted suicide. Mania. Panic attacks. Anxiety. Impaired thinking. Impulsiveness. Acne from hell - large red acne cysts. Acne scars. Ruined skin. Hair loss. Dry skin. Red blotchy skin. Dry eyes. Red eyes. Thyroid disease. Yellow skin (possible liver damage). Extreme insomnia. Increased appetite. Weight gain. Stretch marks. Mood swings. Rage. Feelings of hopelessness. Tremors (couldn't shave or I'd kill myself). Joint pain. Heart palpitations. Infections. Suppressed immune system. Bruising. Couldn't heal. Nausea. Vomiting. Headaches.,Before I took prednisone_ I had perfect skin_ and_ besides an occasional pimple_ never really had much acne. Prednisone changed that; it ruined my skin_ and_ as a result_ destroyed my self-esteem. People I haven't seen since taking prednisone don't even recognize me. My eyes_ from prednisone and all the other drugs_ barely produce tears at all anymore. My eyes are so dry_ I can't wear contacts. The whites of my eyes are almost entirely red. My skin is still yellow. People stare and ask about it; pretty embarrassing. I have lost faith in doctors completely. I've only been to one doctor about my yellow skin. He mentioned the possibility of it being drug-induced hepatitis. I loved my life_ but_ because of this drug_ I hate my life. It didn't even help my disease. I wish my doctors had told me about the side effects and other treatment options--I found a strict diet and probiotics to be more effective than prednisone and all the other drugs combined.,M,19,6  months,7/26/2008,Prednisone intensol
