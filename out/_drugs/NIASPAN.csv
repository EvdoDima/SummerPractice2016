0, 5, high cholesterol,Occasionally I will feel a flushing_ but I know it will go away in 20 to 30 minutes_ so no problem.,It really helps my cholesterol levels. I tried 3 different statins before niacin and had horrible leg pain and mood swings. I felt terrible with statins_ but niacin works great.,M,55,6  years500mg 1X D,12/1/2015,Niaspan

2, 4, cholesterol control,Radical flushing/burning feeling.,"The radical flushing that one would experience taking this medication was effectively controlled by taking an 81mg asprin 30 minutes before bedtime_ then taking the 4 Niaspan caps with two cups of apple sauce. Usually I am not aware of any flushing effects as I sleep. Occasionaly_ I will feel the effect upon waking in the night and rarely upon awaking the next morning. Chocolate and some candy's eaten at bedtime will negate the buffering effect of the apple sauce. These foods also seem to amplify the flushing effect. I would seriously avoid chocolate after taking Niaspan.My cholesterol numbers continue to improve with each 6 month lab test. After receiving a quad bypass at 50_ my heart disease was described as ""quite serious"". Niaspan_ along with lovastatin and carvediol have become my daily regimine_ and I am having little or no negitive side effects from these drugs in combination.",M,53,3  years2000,10/30/2014,Niaspan
3, 5, Elevated Lpa levels,Light flushing_ nausea,My Dr prescribed Niaspan and monitored it with me over a year_ beginning with 500 mg and every 6 weeks increasing the dosage to 750 mg_ 1000 mg_ 1250 mg_ 1500 mg and then finally 2000 mg. This monitoring allowed my body to adjust to the different strengths. However_ my Dr. has now said to stop taking Naispan as studies have recently shown that it is not proven to be as effective as they first thought. Has anyone else heard this? Should I stop all at once or do I need to wean myself from it?,F,66,5  years1000 MG 2X D,10/27/2014Email,Niaspan
4, 1, High Cholesterol_cannot takeStatins,"I took  Niacin ER 2000 mg.for 3 yrs. I expected the occasional flushing and rash on my face. During this time I became very anxious and unable to deal with stress. I was put on two antidepressants. I started with reflux_ nausea_inability to eat without coughing and spitting up_ severe weakness so much that I felt a ""sinking"" feeling and would have to go to bed for an hour several times a day. I attributed the nausea etc. to GI problems. On three occasions during the three years I thought all this was  possibly the flu or stress. Three weeks ago my face began to swell. I looked like I had gained 20 pounds. My weight remained the same. I had blisters on my tongue and sores in my mouth( attributed by my GI MD and Dentist to stress)My tongue felt like it was on fire. I called my Primary care doctor and he said to stop the Niacin immediately and take ASA and Benadryl.I started to look up the side effects of Niacin on medical sites and blogs. All of my symptoms were there. Within one week after stopping the Niacin All of my symptoms disappeared including GI symptoms. I no longer need my acid reducing prescription. I have much more energy. My husband says I am a different person. It has now been three weeks since I quit. I can exercise now and I will gradually start to discontinue my antidepressants.I wish I had known of All the side effects. I urge you all to Refuse to take Niacin!

I slept well that night (first time in a few weeks)_ my mind didn't go goofy with racing thoughts (first time in two weeks)_ and the migraine disappeared the next day.  So I will NOT take this medication again.  I feel soooo much better even after one day of not taking niaspan.However_ I want to tell you that I did NOT experience very much flushing.  I followed my doctor's advice...he said to take one 325 mg. aspirin one hour before taking the niaspan.  Also_ eat an apple or apple sauce with the niaspan.

Basically_ NIH stopped their study when they learned that although Niaspan actually increased HDL_ and reduced triglicerides_ there was ZERO effect of reducing cardiac events_ and there was a slight increase in stroke risk for for the control group.

Unable to get rid of them for over half the next day.  No dry mouth though and do not see this problem listed anywhere.  Don't know if this is connected to Niaspan or another med reaction.,Started 500 mgs to 1000 mgs 1x per day at bedtime.  Always take 3 aspirin or ibuprofen at night for pain.  Now take 30 minutes prior to Niaspan.  First three months_ HDL rose 11 points.  At six months it dropped 9 points lower than the original number.  (Total swing 20 points down.)  Came back up somewhat after nine months.  Doc doubled dose to 2K mgs.  Headaches started.  During a sleep lab study at 1K mgs_ they found my heart rate was 95 while asleep.

59, 2, Bad cholesterol too high,"Scalp_ face and ears burning; fatigue--not enough energy to exercise_ profuse sweating_ ""zoning out_"" occasional nervousness--enough to keep me tossing in bed or making my hand shake on my mouse at work. I even switched from taking at night to the morning_ hoping for improvement. But no. My doctor would not ok a blood test until 6 months_so I sought out a lab on my own.",My blood test showed both my good and bad cholesterol going up 7 points since before the med. So I decided to quit. This is the 3rd day I've been off this med_ and I feel miserable. Since quitting_ I've been urinating excessively_ especially at night_ I've been woozy and very tired. My muscles are stiff. Today at work I suddenly got diarrhea. (Note: I did take Welchol for awhile_ and it worked_ but the muscle aches I experienced were unbearable. I am afraid to try a statin.),F,59,3  months1000 1X D,7/12/2011Email,Niaspan
