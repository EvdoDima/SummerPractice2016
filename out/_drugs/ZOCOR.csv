0, 4, High cholesterol,Could not tolerate the 20mg at first. All sorts of weird side effects even at a lower dose.  Stopped it for a while and was warned by my doctor.

And minimal.,Along with diet and exercise_ it does the job.,M,78,6  years20 1X D,2/20/2016Email,Zocor
1, 1, 134 cholesterol reading,A lot of pain in legs. Loss of libido. Forgetfulness. Dizziness. Loss of muscle strength in my legs.,I was on Statin for two years. This was eight years ago. When I complained about pain I was prescribed Vicodin and Gabapentin. I had this doctor for forty years. Now I am sure he did not know anything about what this poison can do. I found this website too late. I quit against the advice of my doctor when I felt something cristalize in my leg muscles. Now I spend most of my time in a chair because walking is too painful.

5, 2, To lower my ldl_ overall cholestero,Terribly calf_ and back of entire leg CRAMPS! OMG ! I stopped last night. My doctor increased my dosage to 40mg from 20mg about a year ago.

So_why my cardiologist wanted me to go to 80mg_I have no idea. But_ I'm done. I'm calling my doctors_  both my primary and cardiologist in the morning  (it's Sunday). These drugs are very dangerous. I'm thinking to myself_  maybe all the walking is causing my leg pain. Now_ I've been walking every day for 2 year's straight. So_ I figure_  my legs must be conditioned by now. So why_ when I get out of bed (the simvastatin causes insomnia. .I don't care what your doc tells you. Mine told me it's not the simvastatin. I swear these docs are compensated to prescribe medications. Must be. Anyway_ why do my legs hurt so much in the morning?

11, 1, As a precaution against heart attac,I had intense cramps_ weakness_ and other vague pains in my right leg_ which was weakened from childhood polio.I was starting to fear that I might end up in a wheel chair.,I had no problem with this drug for 3 years. My polio attack (age 6) was relatively light_ and I have always been active. I tried stopping Simvastatin (Zocor) 3 times because I couldn't really believe the drug was causing my problems - which I feared was caused by Post Polio Syndrome.I was not advised to stop the 'treatment'_ though my doctor agreed it would be a good idea when I suggested it.The problems started to recede each time I stopped_ but it took 9 months to return to normal. Over that time_ I took an NSAID (diclofenac) in progressively lower doses. This enabled me to exercise again - which I think contributed to my recovery.Note that Zocor seemed to selectively attack my polio leg - so I would advise anyone who has had polio (but really anyone at all!) to avoid this drug completely.,M,64,3  years40 MG 1X D,7/22/2014Email,Zocor

I took 80mg Zocor for 5 months starting January 2011 and stopped June 2011 when I suspected that Zocor may have been the cause of all my symptoms.  The weeks following stopping the medication things got worse.  I had to take a medical leave and eventually lost my job because of all my symptoms.  I saw many specialists and took numerous blood tests and imaging (x-rays and mri's) and had procedures done (upper endoscopy and colonoscopy) and everything was negative.  I was even sent to mental health who cleared of any mental issues.  I was told by both Mental health and neurology that they had seen this before with patients who had taken Simastatin at the high a level.  Things VERY SLOWLY got better but never completely better.    The last specialist I saw--a rheumatologist looking for auto immune disorders told me that since no one can find the answers for all my symptoms to try eastern medicine and holistics.  I didn?t know what to make of that so I went to see a naturopath a year after I stopped taking Zocor (May 2012).  He asked what medications I've been taking prior to my symptoms and he gasped at the high level Zocor.  He pointed out that many of his patients had problems with statins.  He explained to me that the biggest problem with statins is that it inhibits the production of CoQ10 in the body which is required for all systems.

As is always recommended I reported these problems to my doctor and he told me he was certain it wasn't my medication.  I just stopped taking this drug for about a week and the muscle pain is already backing off. Who cares if ""your numbers look good""  if you feel terrible all the time.  Another incentive_ at least for me to quit statins is the updated FDA warnings about increased risk of diabetes and dementia.  My father has been taking ""Lipitor"" for years.  Within the last five years he has been diagnosed with first diabetes then dementia.  A little to close to home since the only reason I took this drug was because of ""Genetic Predisposition"" from Dad.",M,49,5  years40 MG 1X D,3/1/2012,Zocor

47, 4, Very high cholesterol,I have been taking this for the past 16 years. No bad side effects_ just sometimes get itchy like ive got an allergy_ so occasionally take allergy tablet.Would probably have had a heart attack by now if I wasn't taking it. So what would you rather do? Not take it and have a stroke or heart attack or take it followed by a healthy diet and be alive?,,F,41,10  years40,1/31/2012,Zocor
48, 1, Cholesterol slightly high (200+),My arms ached particularly after raking leaves or weightlifting. That was three years ago. They still ache today if I lift heavy objects. For example_ if I hold a toddler for any length of time.,I was eating grapefruit when taking Zocor.  I have no doubt the drug has permanently damaged my arm muscles.  I can't lift weights anymore.  Afterwards my arms ache for weeks. My (former) Doctor wanted me to continue taking Zocor.,M,66,14  days10mg 1X D,1/26/2012,Zocor
49, 2, High cholesterol (296) Genetics,I am a runner. Shocked to find out my cholesterol was so high (296).  Learned it was genetic. Side effects began with Charlie horses/calf pain in the middle of the night. Vaginal pain and dryness_ swollen gland on left side of throat_ sinus infection_ naseua_ indigestion_ dead legs_ and weight gain!  In 3 months_ my cholesterol lowered 103 points_ but it's not worth it. Going cold turkey for 3 months and then re-test and go from there.,,F,39,3  months20 mg,1/20/2012,Zocor
50, 1, Borderline cholesterol & Family hx,I used simvastatin for 3 years. In year number 2 I started having muscle weakness_ leg cramps_ confusion and tinnitus. Year number 3 had trouble walking_ started using bilateral hearing aids_ major leg cramps in especially the top part of my legs. Have seen 2 doctors and 1 neurologist. By the way_ my new doctor just started me on Crestor 3 weeks ago--which my neurologist is weaning. I stopped the simvastatin 1 1/2 years ago but symptoms have not resolved. Currently working with a neurologist to see if effects are reversible. At 57_ the pain and weakness in my legs and arms along with the horrible tinnitus might be permanent. I wish I had known before the first practitioner started me on this med for borderline hyperlipidemia and a family history. I was having no symptoms from the cholesterol itself_ even had a heart cath to prove it.  Most recently besides having trouble walking and climbing steps_ I've had memory clouding and thinning hair. I have a lot of living to do but this has de,,F,57,3  years10 1X D,1/19/2012Email,Zocor

52, 1, high cholesterol/triglycerides,Severe muscle aches_ hair loss_ weight gain,I was doing roller derby at the time_ which produces muscle aches of its own so the muscle aches produced by this drug_ along with the 15lb weight gain and hair loss_ were unacceptable. I found a natural red yeast rice alternative which has brought my cholesterol down from 193 to 182 and my triglycerides down from 347 to 272 (I know that's still high). I intend to stay on the red yeast rice as I have been on it for the past six months with no ill effects and while the cholesterol drop wasn't major_ the tri drop was_ so I will continue with it. I wouldn't recommend a statin drug to anyone unless s/he was a masochist who loved chronic pain and getting fat and bald.,F,28,1  years40 mg 1X D,12/31/2011Email,Zocor

54, 1, Cholesterol,Waves of anxiety_ lasting 2-4 days.,I started having feelings of anxiety and worry_ usually about work issues. I thought maybe I was just reacting to stress at work_ however my feelings were totally out of whack. It would last 2-4 days_ where I had trouble concentrating_ lost appetite_ and just had a feeling of dread. Then it would go away_ and I would be fine for a few days. This cycle continued for almost 3 months. I was so confused by this_ I figured I might need some psychological help. Then it occurred to me this all started at the same time I had started on simvastatin. Anxiety didn't seem to be a listed side effect_ but I was desperate_ so stopped the simvastatin. The anxiety continued for about a week_ then totally stopped. It is 3 weeks now_ no more anxiety_ I'm back to normal! I still can't believe the effect_ especially since I was on a very small dose (5mg). But the facts don't lie. I'm really scared to start on another statin now_ not sure what to do.,M,53,3  months5mg 1X D,11/17/2011Email,Zocor
55, 1, high cholestral,Started meds last Saturday night. Woke up Tuesday morning and was very stiff and sore. I suffer with joint pain and had both knees replaced 5 years ago. As day progressed pain increased. Haven't had pain like this since before knee replacements..Could not figure out why all this pain.. weather? Activity? nothing out of the norm. By late afternoon i had dug out my canes. Remembered doctor saying complications with Zocor could be muscle and joint pain. Called Dr. told her my trouble. She said quit taking the pill and come in for blood work in morning.. Could not get into our mini van_ to much pain. Called my sister who came and got me in her car. Gimped on home in great pain to knees. Thought maybe i felt alittle better last nite_ with hopes of being better in the morning. NOT!! took 10 minutes to get out of bed and make it to bathroom. Called doc. again. My blood work looked fine_ and she didn't think it was connected to the Zocor. I beg to differ. So now what?? How long does it take to,,F,54,3  days10 mg 1X D,11/17/2011Email,Zocor

58, 5, High Cholesterol,None,I've had chronic high cholesterol my entire life as long as doctors have been monitoring it. (10 years now). I was on Lipitor for a while when I was in my teens_ and 100lbs lighter_ but it did nothing to my cholesterol levels.My newest doctor put me on the generic of this (simvastatin) around 4 months ago. I've had no side effects_ and it has worked wonders for my cholesterol. I saw fantastic results after just a month of use. My cholesterol was finally in the normal range (below 200) for the first time ever. While they say its supposed to be used in conjunction with a change in diet and exercise_ I can't really afford to buy a bunch of healthy foods because I'm on food stamps_ and even with no change in my diet and only a small change in my activity levels_ I saw these results.,F,26,4  months20 1X D,10/29/2011Email,Zocor
