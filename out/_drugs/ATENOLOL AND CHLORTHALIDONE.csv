I've been on it for close to a year now with only slight energy loss and it's still working as designed.,F,25,9  months,7/29/2007,Atenolol and chlorthalidone

4, 1, hypertension,Terrible fatigue_ lack of interest in anything_ slept all of the time_ couldn't work out any more (too tired). Wife said I was a complete slug.  I already had a low heart rate in the 40s due to running_ and this drove it to nothing.,Now on Diovan HCT. It has no side effects_ works great_ does not reduce my energy_ and I run every day with no effect. Can say none of these things for beta blockers.  No way I could recommend them.,M,47,6  months,11/14/2004,Atenolol and chlorthalidone
