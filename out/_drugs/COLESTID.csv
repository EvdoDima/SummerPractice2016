0, 5, Runny stool,N/A,I had a major bowel resection 22 years ago due to Crohn's Disease.  After my colostomy was reversed_ problems with runny stool persisted due to shortening of the bowel.  After a year of panic about not being able to reach a bathroom in time_ I finally asked my doctor if there was something I could take and he prescribed Colestid.  While Colestid is a drug for cholesterol_ the main side effect is causing constipation_ and in my case_ helps my bowels to function normally.  No more urgent trips to the bathroom!  It has definitely led to a better quality of life for me.,F,43,19  years30mg 1X D,9/14/2011Email,Colestid
