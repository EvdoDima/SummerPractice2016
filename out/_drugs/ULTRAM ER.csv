0, 1, Back and leg pain,I spent 11 hours waiting for extreme nausea from the very first pill to end.  It helped the pain but being so sick was awful.  In the trash it goes.  Back to naproxen sodium.,,F,63,1  days50 MG,3/8/2015,Ultram er
1, 3, Arthritis in hips,Weight loss,"(fyi_I've had no unpleasant side effects.) After starting this medicine_I began to lose weight_ unawares. I was shocked when at the 3 month check-up_ I learned I'd dropped 23 pounds. Now_ after taking it 7 months_ I have dropped about 50 pounds. Caused me to not feel normal hunger. I would begin a meal_ but feel full quickly_to the point that I absolutely wanted NO more. Very unusual. Normally_ I'd want seconds!  This will cause your stomach to shrink. 2 mo ago_weight loss began to slow-thought it might be stopping altogether. I determined to help it out a bit.Tried to make sure I never ate 'tween meals_ etc. I've continued to lose weight_ w/o any real effort_but slower than before-probably a good thing. Only other possible cause for weight loss is use of a hot tub.  About the same time as I started with the Ultram_ after reading online about the potential benefits of hot tub use for Arthritis sufferers_ we purchased 1; I began to use it-virtually every day for at least an hour or longer. (Husband built ""desk"" that fits across it. I go out with Bible_ computer_ etc & make good use of my time.) According to an online study_those in 1 for at least 30 min/day lose an average of 1 lb/week.  Whatever the cause-probably a combination-the weight loss has been significant;that_ in itself_ helps any overweight arthritis patient. I'd be interested in knowing of similar experiences.",F,57,7  months200 mg 1X D,10/12/2011Email,Ultram er
2, 3, I was taking 'regular' Ultram on an,Itchy face_ and nausea like codeine_ but lasts much longer_ good for dental pain_ lower lumbar_ old man's knee_ etc. I always wondered why it made me feel peppy and got me out of the house a few times (I could walk again)and then turned into a depressing hallucination filled crash.  Only recently I discovered it has an SRI effect! And along with any SRI's dreadful side FX_comes that awful medical 'addiction' I couldnt understand why the walls moved up and down and the carpet would ripple like wind on a pond- for over a week-Stopping 90 days of morphine and dilaudid was much easier_ and quicker.Even a barbiturate detox was a tea party next to getting off SRI's.The entire class of SRI's is as prevalent and over prescribed_ like PFL's in the early '50's- Major doses of major narcotics and barbiturates in the 60's- Drs handing out power packed speedballs for people who 'need a little energy' during the day_ and want to skip lunch.What will they say in 20yrs about the time Dr's gave,Ultram manages pain ok_ first like a stiff dose of codeine for a week or so_ then your natural tolerance kicks in_ and makes it pretty useless.It was thankfully free of toxic Ibupro/aceto-But then I find out it also has an SRI action_ and that typical SRI withdrawal nightmare.,M,63,15  days150-250mg 1X D,8/26/2010Email,Ultram er
