0, 2, Blood Clot,Hair Loss_ Bruising and bumps at injection sites,For what it's worth_ I experienced hair loss with Coumadin too.  On Arixtra_ when I would accidently cut myself_ I would still clot and my weight fluxuates between 108-110lbs_ so the dosage should have been optimal to overdose for my size.  I didn't get another blood clot_ so I can't say it didn't do it's job though....,F,24,8  months5 MG 1X D,3/23/2011Email,Arixtra
