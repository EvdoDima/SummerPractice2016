0, 1, lower back pain rupture disk,Mild to no pain relief. Highly constipated after only 5 pills. Blood in my stool when I could go 48 hours after discontinuing. HIGH cost of 1500.00 for a 90 day supply the drug company ships to you and charges your insurance.,"I was given this product by my doctor instead of hydrocodone they now refuse to dispense.They told me ""we've never prescribed it the doctor just grabbed the 3 day sample off the shelf and decided to make me their test subject. They also gave me 10mg of flexeril to take with it at night...DANGER BEWARE....This combo nearly killed me. First off did nothing for the pain I was experiencing from a ruptured L5 disk in my lower back. I only took 5 pills and boy that was enough.I got so constipated and could not go for 48 hours when I did it was extremely painful like pushing hardening cement through me. I stopped taking it the second day. I took the flexeril at night like they prescribed but unlike prior experiences with flexeril and hydrocodone this combo now made the flexeril act differently on me. I became highly anxious my eye pupils got very small and my heart rate was erratic and pounding out of my chest. I thought I was going to die I stopped both of them and tried to contact my doctor about my concerns by email but they won't contact me back. I looked online and all the articles say taking high dose of Ibuprofen and flexeril is safe. That's bullcrap I'm convinced if I was not aware and just listened to the experts I'd be dead right now.....",M,52,2  days2800 mg,4/24/2016Email,Duexis
