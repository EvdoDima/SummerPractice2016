0, 5, Butt acne,Dryness_ peeling,I believe this is the correct medication to add my comments on.  I was using the TOPICAL Erthromycin 2% gel for about 2 weeks I think. (All the others seem to be oral meds.  This is the closest listing I could find)  This worked fast.  The problem never returned.  I had these inflamed pimples on my butt which made it uncomfortable to sit in certain positions!  The cause was unknown_ but this gel was great in getting rid of it.,F,46,2  weeks,6/5/2008,Erygel
