9, 1, Hypertension,For two years_ I've felt like I don't give a S**t about anything_ and thought it was menopause related. At doc last week and BP 170/86. Says we'll add Norvasc and mentions that the BetaBlocker really slows down your heartrate. Asked if that's why I'm tired and don't care about anything_ because I was certain it was my hormones. Have been taking Norvasc along with Labetalol for 8 days_ and I feel like myself again_ lost 7 pounds_ wanted to go hiking and clean my house. It's been a dump for two years and I couldnt stand that it didn't bother me.  It wasn't hormones_ it was Labetalol!,,F,50,2  years 2X D,10/20/2014,Labetalol hcl
10, 4, Neurocardiogenic Syncope,None,I was switched from metoprolol to labetalol when I became pregnant. I have no complaints so far. Metoprolol worked great for me_ as far as keeping my fainting at bay_ but it made me so tired. I felt a huge energy increase when I started labetalol. I haven't experienced any fainting with it so far.,F,29,5  months50 mg 1X D,6/4/2014,Labetalol hcl

12, 1, hyptertension,I took medicine for about three weeks several months ago and experienced horrible hallucinations. Later_ I was taken off the prescription and given something else. Recently_ I was prescribed the medicine again and have taken it for only about 14 days. Again_ the horrible hallucinations occur. I also have difficulty sleeping and have become fearful. The medicine_ however_ is effective in reducing the blood pressure.,,M,60,14  days300mg 3X D,1/4/2014,Labetalol hcl

18, 4, High Blood Pressure,The first few weeks or so_ I was extremely tired.  I adjusted to the medication though & never experienced any side effects after that point.  This drug is extremely safe to take during pregnancies and while breastfeeding. I have been taking since I was 29 due to HBP.  It ran in my family & other lifestyle changes did not help reduce my blood pressure (low salt diet_ exercise_ diet_ etc.).,,F,40,11  years,8/15/2007,Labetalol hcl
19, 3, high blood pressure,I feel tired after just walking up steps.,I was taking it twice a day_ but had to eliminate the dose in the morning because it pushed my blood pressure to a level that made me dizzy.,M,59,3  weeks,3/17/2007Email,Labetalol hcl
20, 1, hypertension; palpitations,Tingling in scalp--almost a burning sensation; dizziness; upset stomach; muscle pain; extreme fatigue; unexplained weight gain...increased after first week.,My doctor wisely started me on the lowest dose--50 mg twice a day--to supplement Diovan since I was having frequent palpitations. On the fifth day_ my scalp began tingling oddly and it hurt to touch my head or comb my hair. I had muscular pain in both arms and some nausea and discomfort in my stomach. I was tired all the time--occasionally dizzy--affecting my work. My doctor told me to stop immediately_ stating that some people cannot tolerate beta blockers. I will be starting a new drug this week to address the palpitations. the side effects would seem to outweigh any benefit of this medication.,F,56,2  weeks,9/8/2006,Labetalol hcl
21, 3, hypertension,Extreme tiredness_ coughing_ dry throat_ stomach upset and frequently causing vomiting even with food or milk. Gained well over 20 pounds in 6 months_ 15 more since then_ even with the loss of appetite caused by med.,It does work on my blood pressure so Dr refuses to take me off it. Last Dr I had refused too but they don't understand how horrible it makes me feel. So I guess since it lowered my BP I am forced to give it a 3 but if offered something else I would be first in line.,F,47,2  years,4/3/2006,Labetalol hcl
