0, 1, clostridium difficele,Nausea_ severe heatburn_ severe fatigue_ abdominal distention_ backache_ appetite changes_ intermittent anxiety_ poor sleep due to side effects making me feel so ill in addition to unusual anxiety_ liver function tests (ALT_ AST_ alkaline phosphatase) elevated out of normal range.  My alkaline phosphatase was so elevated (249 with normal range of 40-150) that my MD ordered an abdominal ultrasound as he suspected liver or gallbaldder disease.  My ultrasound was normal and it was determined that elevated levels were due to the metronidazole (flagyl).  That is how hard the drug was on my system.,I made it thorugh day 8 of 10 day course and returned to the doctor because of how bad the combined side effects were making me feel.  He took me off of the metronidazole.  The c. diff diarrhea returned and I was placed on oral vancomycin.  Day 8 of the vanco.  I feel much better as the vanco has not given me any side effects to speak of.  After stopping the metronidazole I was searching the web for side effects of the drug and came across this website. I was stunned to see how many people had the same or a very similar group of side effects_ particularly several that mentioned the anxiety.  I think the doctor did not believe me that I felt the drug was causing the anxiety spells.  I honestly felt as if I were poisoning myself the more doses I forced myself to take.  This drug may work but for at least a very significant portion of patients it has very_ very harsh side effects.,F,54,8  days500 mg 3X D,4/1/2011Email,Vandazole
