5, 4, Gastroparesis/nausea/vomiting/sleep,This drug worked well. I take it in IV for every night. After four years of taking it this way_ I found that it started to affect my memory.

6, 1, Insomnia,Stopped breathing when trying to sleep. Extreme anxiety.,Taking this was a complete nightmare. My husband had to sit awake all night with me to make sure I did not stop breathing. Absolutely terrible experience. Was taking it for sleep and it ended up keeping TWO people awake for the whole night. I cannot believe this med is so widely available over the counter,F,53,1  days25mg 1X D,12/6/2015Email,Phenergan
7, 1, Sleep,Difficulty breathing_ tingling_ dizziness,I will NEVER take this again. I took it to help me sleep since I suffer from chronic insomnia_ it made me extremely tired but - the downside was I was struggling to breathe. Every time I fell asleep I woke up quickly_ franticly trying to breathe. My whole body was tingling with pins and needles and I felt really strange and out of it. Once I finally fell to sleep I had the most restless sleep yet_ and ended up sleep walking. I've never sleep walked in my life and it hasn't happened since taking this medication. Not pleasant.,F,20,1  days 1X D,10/22/2015,Phenergan
8, 4, Food poisoning,Relaxed_ tired and no more nausea.,I got really ill from food poisoning and this stuff took away the nausea asap_ while allowing me to relax and sleep well. I took it as a suppository and I'm sure that's why it worked better than the pills.

11, 1, Severe nausea and pain,vomiting_ syncope_ convulsions_ and respiratory distress. I stopped breathing.,I was given this medicine via needle 3 times_ and each time my reaction became more severe. The nurse told the doctor that I was having these reactions_ but he wouldn't listen to her_ and ordered more. After the third injection_ I awoke to one nurse spraying me with oxygen_ one nurse shaking me by the shoulders_ and a third nurse slapping me across the face. Repeatedly. Nasty crap.,F,27,1  days 3X H,10/2/2014Email,Phenergan
12, 1, Nausea,Had an upset stomach so took half of a 25 mg pill. Worked well and made me very sleepy so I went to bed. Woke up 20 minutes later and felt like I was losing my mind. Stayed awake for a half hour and began to regain myself. Went to sleep again and within minutes woke up and felt crazy again. Do not take this unless you are very sick.,,M,27,1  days12.5,9/17/2014,Phenergan
13, 3, pain- help Dilaudid work better,Wow. Most Physicians around here (Western PA) don't prefer to prescribe this med anymore due to its side effects_ lasting side effects and irreversible side effects such as tremors. I was given 10mg of Dilaudid combined with 30 mg of Phenergan every 2 hrs for a Kidney stone_ which I was prone to. I was given a high dose of pain med because I'm on 75mcg of fentanyl X72hrs patch and 30mg of Oxycodone X3 daily. I felt SO high. Confusion_ extremely tired_ tremors_ talking but not making sense. (Like I was drunk) I was kept over night for observations and was given this combo every 2 hrs. After awhile_ I didn't like the feeling but it worked. Now_ I prefer Dilaudid combined with Zofran. * Feel free to contact me with pain issues and other issues you may have.Mr. Robert N. Davis,,M,37,10  times30mg,7/16/2014Email,Phenergan
14, 1, Pain- given with Demerol,"At that time I felt bad burning up my veins. They had to redo my IV site 2-4x's a day from veins ""burning out""","I had severe bowel obstruction_ if I did not eat I had no nausea. I asked the nurses many times to stop this med. Dr. wanted it given just ""in case"" & to increase Demerol effect. I got an IV shot almost every 4 hrs for 3 wks.They had to put in a central line because my veins were bad. NOW> I have only 1-2 places where they can put an IV or draw blood. Also> 2 yrs later I was found to have severe CHF_ and the symptoms had started after I got out of the hospital!!",F,48,21  days? 5X D,3/14/2014Email,Phenergan

30, 3, Nausea,This caused Cervical Dystonia (a neurological condition).  My neurologist said it could.  Here is a list of drugs that can cause Dystonia:  lifeinpain.org/node/3.,It also caused sleepiness.  I like Zofran a lot better.  Zofran didn't cause Cervical Dystonia either.,M,49,7  days25 mg. 1X D,2/6/2012,Phenergan
31, 5, Insomnia_ nausea_ allergies,I find phenergan an extremely safe drug and useful for several conditions. Primarily taken at bedtime to allow relaxation and sleep. I took this every other night for years with minimal side effects_ but it does produce poor quality_ light sleep and nightmares_ and a little weight gain. Since reducing to only a couple of nights a month_ my sleep quality has improved and i no longer rely on it. No long term ill effects that im aware of. Experienced a little increased anxiety and moodiness_ and obviously some difficulty getting to sleep at first_ upon withdrawal.,,F,25,4  years12.5-25mg,1/23/2012,Phenergan
32, 4, seasickness,Drowsiness_ flushing_ nightmares,Prevented vomiting from seasickness_ though it didn't entirely eliminate the nausea. The drowsiness wasn't actually a bad thing - sleep is the best cure for motion sickness_ in my opinion.

Recently I have been taking Phenergan a few times a day for a few weeks and I started having awful spells where my vision went crazy and I had right hand tremors-- it was very scary I wouldn't suggest anyone take this drug for long periods of time!!

44, 4, nausea/vomiting due to migraine,"Drowsiness_ extreme at first with some hangover effect (but not unbearable ""Remeron"" like_ least for me).   I've grown tolerant to the sedative effects_ after about 3 months continuous usage (not daily_ but 3-4x weekly).",Works AWESOMELY for my nausea/vomiting_ but only certain types.  Flu-like nausea_ airsickness_ and food-related nausea respond well to Phenergan for me.  However_ I get weird vertigo/nausea/vomiting (from reading_ or sometimes just randomly).  Phenergan doesn't touch that (only good weed does).,F,28,7  years25mg 1X AN,11/15/2011Email,Phenergan

47, 3, nausea,Nightmares_ hallucinations_ tremors_ extreme fatigue,Phenergan_ at first_ seemed like it would be the miracle drug I've been looking for. I am prone to anxiety with nausea as a result_ especially in airplanes. I figured that I would save some of this medicine for when I travel but there is NO WAY I will even consider it. I took it last week for some nausea (relating to flu). The first 6 hours were fine (I slept through 4 of them)_ but afterward I felt very jittery - my fists clenched by themselves at one point. I fell asleep and then woke up only to find I was actually still dreaming. I experienced sleep paralysis (lucid dreams_ too_ but not the good kind) which was terrifying. The next day I was SO TIRED even though I'd just had 8 hours sleep. I will never take it again unless I can't stop vomiting and there is no choice. It DID help with the nausea_ but the rest was just...yuck!,F,27,2  days 3X D,5/19/2011Email,Phenergan
48, 4, severe pregnancy nausea and vomiting,Very sleepy_ strange dreams,I have to say_ I appreciate this medication.  I suffered severe nausea and vomiting from my pregnancy and was on the verge of being admitted to Tue hospital for dehydration and malnutrition.  For me_ the benefits outweigh the risks.,F,30,4  months25 mg 2X D,4/19/2011,Phenergan
49, 5, Nausea from migraines.,My doctor originally prescribed Phenergan for the nausea that comes with my migraines.  I have found_ although it does make me sleepy_ it also takes away almost all of the migraine pain 90% of the time.  In addition_ I have not experienced vomiting in years.,It does make me sleepy_ but also takes away the pain and nausea of migraine headaches.,F,67,6  years10 mg 1X AN,3/9/2011Email,Phenergan
50, 4, Severe nausea_ Vomiting,I wanted to lay in bed all day because I was so tired and I am actually on it now and it has been a hour and a half and it has taken no effect yet.,It's great through an IV but man in pill form it really sucks for me. It takes way to long for it to start working. I took it for the first time three days ago and I held it in for an hour and finally puked it up. It just does not seem like it wants to work on the spot for nausea.,M,18,3  days25 MG 3X D,12/20/2010,Phenergan
51, 5, Nausea after surgery,As soon as the nurse injected it into my IV I stopped vomiting and passed out_ but that could be because I just came out of surgery and had been given other pain meds_ anesthesia_ and other nausea meds.,When I came out of surgery I was vomiting non-stop and the nurse gave me a nausea med. I don't remember what it was_ but it did not work at all so an hour later she injected my IV with Phenergan and it instantly stopped the vomiting and I felt SO much better. If I ever get surgery again_ I will be requesting this drug for post op.,F,25,1  daysIV 1X O,11/15/2010,Phenergan
52, 5, Nausea and Vomiting,Sleepiness and dry mouth,Phenergan is a great medication for nausea and vomiting!!  I have had Zofran for nausea and vomiting also in the hospital.  As many people on here have stated Phenergan is inexpensive and it really cures and wipes out nausea and vomiting!For anyone who can not take Phenergan I would suggest either Zofran or Meclizine.  These medications may cause you to have less side effects since everyone reacts differently to medication.,F,35,30  days25MG 1X D,11/9/2010,Phenergan
53, 1, post surgical nausea,After single dose (injection) was unable to speak coherently - could not make the words verbalized match the thoughts I wanted to communicate.  Thus unable to respond to doctor's questions re pain and nausea.  I also felt dizzy and anxious. Awful!,Will not take it or any phenothiazine again. After this surgery_ short term memory was significantly affected for months - computer tasks learned in a 3 month  intensive training immediately pre-op were not able to be reclaimed in the subsequent 3 month period.  However it is unclear which of the various anesthetics_ pain medications (which I stopped within a few days after leaving the hospital) or other meds contributed to these lasting effects on mental function.,F,55,  1X O,10/26/2010,Phenergan
54, 4, Nausea,Very_ very_ very tired the next day. Was completely out of it for about 24 hours afterward and really could not function well. No appetite_ just wanted to sleep and nothing else.,Did the job like a champ.,M,32,1  days25mg 1X D,8/28/2010,Phenergan
55, 5, Detox from methadone,Very easy sedation.  Side-effect so worth it compared to being in fetal position all night sick holding stomach.,I totally understand some peoples negative side-effects but when detoxing from methadone (possibly opiates but never tried when using)I'll take as much sleep as possible.  Also helped w/ massive insomnia that I had B-4 being given this_ what I consider to be_ miracle drug.,M,33,3  weeks25mg/50mg 3X D,6/7/2010,Phenergan
56, 4, Nausea from Depo shot,Sleepiness/lack of energy_ restless legs,After a few weeks of using this drug_ it doesn't make me too drowsy any more_ but it has started causing a restless leg syndrome-like effect. My legs have this awful creepy-crawly feeling that just makes me cringe. It's terrible_ but the nausea I had was worse. Sometimes after taking it I feel a severe lack of energy and I just don't do anything because I feel too tired to move.,F,25,1  months25 MG 1X D,5/25/2010,Phenergan
57, 5, vertigo_ nausea,"Side effects seem to vary each time I take it. The more severe side-effects are less frequent. Mild drowsiness; excitation; decreased comprehension and focus; verbal paraphasia (usually totally unrelated word but similar sounding_ example ""cajun"" instead of ""agent""); and the worst (only had this a few times) I feel agitated and anxious and feel like I have to do something with my hands: sometimes I ball my fists or shake my arms or rub/scratch when I don't have an itch; last time I had this urge to snap things in half_ I went outside and broke some sticks to spare my ruler and pencils and felt better afterwards.",I had been taking meclizine for my vertigo/nausea but it made me really drowsy and didn't completely relieve my symptoms. Last year I got the flu and my GP prescribed Phenergan for the nausea/vomiting. It worked really well for that and didn't make me nearly as drowsy as the meclizine. I read online about it being used for vertigo as well so I asked my doctor about it and started taking it for my vertigo instead of meclizine. The weird side effects kind of freak me out but generally I'm much more functional at work on Phenergan than on meclizine or nothing at all.,F,26,8  months12.5 1X AN,3/6/2010,Phenergan
58, 4, Allergy,Dry mouth_ lethargic_ tired_ no energy completely drained_ I literally sleep for two days after taking it.,I take the drug whenever a rash and hives come up on my body due to an allergic reaction which I don't know what is caused by.  Maybe dust mites or washing powder?!,F,24, 25 1X D,2/26/2010,Phenergan
59, 5, extreme morning sickness,a little sleepiness and dry mouth,This was a life saver for me_ my son would never had been born if I didn't take this medication! I didn't experience any of those horrible side effects others have. The benefits outweigh the risks_ as long as you aren't allergic and it is administered properly then it works.,F,31,9  months,1/3/2010,Phenergan
