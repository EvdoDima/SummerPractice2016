0, 5, behavior issues,My son is 3 and was having extreme behavioral issues_ nightmares_ peeing his pants when he got mad_ even getting kicked out of his preschool program.  I had him evaluated by numbers of therapists_ behavioral specialists_ mobile therapists_ and occupational therapists.  He was seeing a therapist at daycare once a week along with a behavior specialist_ and nothing seemed to be working_ he was getting worse.  I finally took him to a psychiatrist who reccomended this medication for bi-polar/ADHD.  Within 2 days_ his behavior had changed drastically.  It is now only 2 weeks later_ he is back in his preschool program_ doing fantastic_ getting smiley faces every day and has gone a whole week without one time out!!!  He no longer pees his pants_ he is easier to talk to and reason with_ he listens_ pays attention_ and I am even getting compliments on his good behavior from the daycare. This medicine hasn't made him like a zombie_ or made him lose his appetite.  He is a much happier little boy_,My life has changed drastically since putting him on this medicine.  I felt bad putting him on it at first because he's only 3_ but I couldn't be happier with the results.,F,26,2  weeks,1/23/2009,Chlorpromazine hcl
