0, 5, Unprovoked DVTs and PEs,No side effects. I was on Coumadin for 5 years prior to going on Xarelto and actually had 4 blood clots while on Coumadin. I have had NO clots since starting Xarelto. It has been great. No monthly blood checks. No dietary restrictions. I'm so glad some drug manufacturer made a different blood thinner other than Coumadin which is literally rat poison.,I am very cold a lot. Like freezing. But I had this when I was taking Coumadin_ as well. I don't bruise or bleed as much as I did when I was on Coumadin. My eyesight has gotten worse_ but I think it is just genetics and aging and not related to Xarelto. Please contact me if you have any questions. Dosing if this drug is very important because it can affect your organs that filter it. It made my creatinine levels higher at first_ but then I went from 20-15 mgs_ and it is fine now.,F,44,5  years15 mg,8/7/2016Email,Xarelto
1, 2, PE,Diagnosed with PE on July 7_ 2016. Started out in 15mg twice a day for the first 20 days & now on 20mg once a day. It makes me feel awful...dizziness_  nausea_ & headaches. I'm fatigued & have no energy around the clock. It's difficult to work. I've gone to the ER twice since being discharged from the hospital because of my dizziness. My potassium has dropped & my doctor can't figure out why. I had to be given potassium by IV & a prescription to get my potassium up. It's been a nightmare. I have vivid dreams ... All of this & I'm not even scheduled hematologists until August 15th because I'm a new patient. I'm so outdone!,,F,44,1  months20mg daily,8/7/2016Email,Xarelto

7, 2, ,Joint pain_ itching_ hoarseness,I was prescribed Xarelto after an ankle fusion to prevent clots (run in the family_ no movement in leg for 3 months).  I'm really disappointed with the extra joint pain_ when I just had surgery to correct the pain I am having from severe osteo-arthritis. Overall_ I guess the medicine is effective_ does its job_ but the side effects suck. Period.,F,36,2  months15 MG,5/18/2016Email,Xarelto
8, 3, Dvt and PE,I was put on Xarelto for provoked blood clots in my leg that went to my lungs. I just had my 1 month checkup and Dr. said the clots look good. So the drug worked on that. But let me tell you the hell I went through. 3 weeks of the worst joint pain I have ever had. I could only walk if I had to. And my knees would not bend. My knees bend about 90 degrees now but being unable to walk for three weeks left me with a lot of muscle lose. I can walk with a cane and the muscles are getting stronger but please don't put yourself through this. If you feel joint pain talk to your doctor and try something else. You should know in a day or two.,,M,46,1  months20,5/12/2016,Xarelto

17, 5, Multiple idiopathic DVT and 2 PEs,At first_ the 20 mg elevated my creatinine in my blood when I had routine blood work done. I dropped down to 15 mg and levels went down to normal range.,A Godsend.... Was on Coumadin for 5 years and was never therapeutic and actually had 4 more blood clots in my calves while in Coumadin in 5 years while on that rat poison...... Xarelto has been great..... Never had a blood on Xarelto (knock on wood) No side effects at all other than always being cold_ which I had on Coumadin_ as well. So thankful for this drug. No monthly (or more) testing and always therapeutic and no diet restrictions! It's about time they made something better and less antiquated than Coumadin!,F,43,3  years15 msg,10/10/2015Email,Xarelto
18, 1, DVT and PE,I have terrible muscle and joint aches_ gained weight yet have no appetite_ extreme fatigue and brain fog. Until I started taking this medication_ I was an active and healthy 40 y/o however I found out I suffer from MTHFR_ which is a genetic condition which causes my blood to clot_ and ever since I have felt as though my body is at least 20 years older than it is.  My doctor doesn't seem to listen or care about my side effects. I've never been sick in my life and now I feel like I have the flu every single day.,I wish I never would've started this medication and have requested my doctor put me on something different however he is reluctant to do so.,F,41,5  months20,9/21/2015,Xarelto
19, 5, clotting_ factor v leiden_ lupus,Bruises take a long time to heal_ but what do you expect! And I don't really cut or injure myself_ so that's not a problem.,"I LOVE XARELTO. I didn't want to go on a blood thinner at all and this option was perfect for me to get started. Coumadin_ that rat poison_ was off the table. Now_ I did have a couple of ""episodes"" called TIAs while on Xarelto because I hate taking medicine and would forget to take my pill....for instance_ one weekend_ took it Thursday night_ didn't take it Friday night or Saturday night_ then took it at 10pm Sunday night_ got up Monday morning for work and at 8am had an incapacitating TIA. You definitely have to take it right.  ER doctors hate this drug for some reason. My husband would tell them I take Xarelto and they'd trash the drug bc there I was proof it didn't work. Of course when I came around I didn't own up to not taking it properly. I'm sorry Xarelto. I did fess up with my regular doctors though. My doctors warned me about riding roller coasters_ etc. but I did anyways_ never had any problems. It is a great drug and like taking a placebo. No issues at all.",F,36,3  years10 1X D,8/18/2015Email,Xarelto
20, 1, prevent blood clots,I think they were 15 mg. I developed a rash and itching so my doc told me to stop taking it_ but the rash and itching continued and became very severe. All over legs_ feet_ hands and arms. Doctor was treating with prednisone and benadryl with no relief. When it spread to my back after 7 weeks (by this time I was horrible looking_ red welts_ itching so bad I couldn't sleep) I went to a dermatologist who said it was from Xarelto_ it has a long half life or something_ gave me a huge shot of steroids and a prescription_ steroid lotions and it finally went away. I will never touch this med again_ I suffered.,,F,67,3  days15 mg 2X D,7/24/2015,Xarelto
21, 2, Pulmonary embolisms,I took Coumadin for one year after embolisms back in 2010. The INR testing was a pain but lived to tell about it. Been on xarelto for 2 months and am miserable.

Pain in muscles and joints had become crippling.,I had to take Gavipentin and Norco in an attempt to stifle the pain caused by this drug_ which provided some relief_ but I shouldn't have to take drugs to try to cancel out the negative effects of this drug.

30, 5, Pulmonary Embolisms,Minor intermittent incidents of itchiness and slight hair loss. Possibly low energy_ but that was more likely from the PEs.,SO grateful for Xarelto & knowing I was always in therapeutic mode.  Took forever to get INR up to 2.0 the 2 weeks I was on warfarin & I never knew if I was protected or not_ not to mention the huge inconvenience of going to the lab with O2 in tow when I was really ill.

32, 1, blood clot in legs,My 81 yr old father developed blood and fluid filled blisters_ bruises and peeling skin_ that opened up and wept fluid after taking only 30mg over two days. It also interfered with a nerve block my dad had been given for another health issue. The side effects never stopped and nothing could be done to stop them. He died in agony. I WOULD REFUSE THIS THINNER AND REQUEST THE TRIED AND TRUSTED OLDER THINNERS. YOU HAVE TO ENDURE THE INCONVENIENCE OF FREQUENT LAB TESTS BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REMEDY IF IT YOU HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS.,IT IS IN INSANE THAT PHYSICIANS NOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY DO NOT TELL PATIENTS THAT THERE IS NO REVERSAL DRUG FOR THIS THINNER. IF YOU TAKE ONE OF THE OLDER THINNERS LIKE WARFARIN AND EXPERIENCE A SIDE EFFECT VITAMIN K WILL REVERSE IT.
