0, 1, Reative Airway Disorder,Nervousness_ Difficulty sleeping_ Gas_ Diarrhea_ gerd_ skin irritation_ nightmares,Started trial of the nebulized version of pulmicort. After 1 hour_ I noticed mild skin irriation. After 2.5 hours_ my stomach started to rumble loudly. I took some antacid went to bed. Had difficulty falling asleep. Had two nightmares_ one of which woke me heart  pounding_ woke with diarrhea. I can also feel the acid in my esophagus which was not there before taking this product. No thanks!  I have a very hard time finding an effective treatment for my symptoms as so many meds create an adverse reaction.,F,44, 2 Mg 2X D,2/11/2016Email,Pulmicort respules
1, 1, asthma,irritable_ aggressive_ defiant_ disrupted sleep,My 4-year-old has been taking Pulmicort for 2 years and we've only just made the connection to his difficult behavior. It felt like he was always either stalling or squalling. At worst he would have raging tantrums multiple times a day. We stopped treatment about a month ago and the change was night and day. He also started sleeping through the night more often. When Singulair didn't work_ we resumed Pulmicort and within a few days he started showing some of the old defiant tendencies. We are taking him back off and researching alternatives.,M,4,2  years.25 mg 1X D,8/24/2014Email,Pulmicort respules
2, 1, allergy-induced bronchitis & asthma,It resolved any tightness from bronchitis & asthma within an hour but caused violent_ angry thoughts that developed into uncontrollable rage.  I don't want to ever take it again because I don't want to be liable for my behavior. This drug could make me harm others.  This was very disturbing_ unsettling_ out of character.,I would use any/all alternatives first if needed.  I will not go back to this unless I can sign a release of liability.  Poor parents who have to deal with their tiny temporary drug induced Hulks.,F,44,1  days60mg 1X D,8/20/2014,Pulmicort respules

4, 1, asthma,My normally loving_ kind son became a monster while taking this and other allergy and steroid based meds. He would cry all day long_ hit and kick (which he had never done until on the meds) and he will not eat and sleeps constantly. Naps keep getting longer and longer and he still wakes up appearing tired and restless and then cries more. His normally mild tantrums became unbearably violent and hysterical. Screaming would not stop_ hitting and biting himself in frustration started. He complained his head and stomach hurt all the time which he had never done before. He said foods tasted funny_ no matter the food. Many bruises started to appear on his legs... more than the norm. Overall_ my child turned into someone we didn't recognize. We want our sweet child back!,I do not recommend giving this to any children. It has horrible side effects for some kids. Beware of this possibility.,M,2.5,2  weeks5 mg 2X D,2/9/2011,Pulmicort respules

6, 3, Allergy Induced Asthma,"Improved breathing and reduced illness recurrence.  Unfortunately_ my 6 year old had uncontrollable rage and mood swings.  He lost all ability to reason_ could not sleep_ was hyper and exhausted.  I cannot tell you how awful it was for my husband and I until it dawned on us that it could be the medication.  Sure enough within 2 days of stopping it he started to return to ""normal"".  My doctor did not believe me and wanted me to start the medication again.  I refused.",I have to say that because my son's Asthma is not severe_ we were able to stop taking this medication.  It really worked for his breathing and I have friends who have had great luck with this medication for their kids severe Asthma symptoms without the behavioral issues.  It is just not a good med. for my son.,M,6,2  months,9/16/2008,Pulmicort respules
7, 1, Asthma,This medication does help our sons asthma_ but the side effects seem to outweigh.  I have realized since he has become potty trained_ that giving him this medication makes him incontinent.  This is very upsetting to him.  The Dr's seem surprised and I'm not sure they believe me_ but it is factual.  It also makes him very moody and sensitive and he will cry at the drop of a pin.  His preschool teachers knew when he had been on this med as his behavior would change so drastically.  I feel badly that we left him on this med for so long_ but it is hard to sort out what is toddler behavior and what is medication induced.  Trust your gut_ I wish I had.,We have decided to discontinue_ but are very disappointed as we know his asthma symptoms will increase.,M,4,2  years,3/13/2008,Pulmicort respules
8, 3, asthma,irritability_ uncontrollable anger_ absolute defiance.,"Concern about ""published"" side effects not saying anything about the ones I have experienced with this child.  Seems there are others with same signs.  What is medical field feedback? Anyone know? Would appreciate comment.",M,2.5,4  months,3/9/2008Email,Pulmicort respules
9, 2, Asthma,2 year old went from being nice_ loving_ and happy to dropping on floor_ constant crying at school_ hyper_ standing on table_ and napping every where.  Preschool commented on crying for two days and sleeping all day on cot and not herself.  Also bruising on arms_ legs_ buttocks_ and back.  Seemed a little withdrawn at times.,It helped her to sleep through the night_ which is what the problem was.,F,2,5  days,12/11/2007,Pulmicort respules
10, 1, Asthma_ cough,Coughing_ irratibility_ extreme tiredness_ but inability to sleep.  Too young to know for sure_ but may be having signs of aggression.,This medicine was prescribed to my child and I was led to believe that without it her asthma would keep her in the hospital.  While on Pulmicort she's been to the ER twice and admitted to the hospital once.  I was told there were no side effects_ but her coughing increased dramatically.  Each time I complained of her cough_ they increased her dose.  Finally after researching on my own_ I learned coughing IS a side effect.  Now that she's off it_ she's not coughing and sleeping through the night.  We still have to deal with her asthma_ but Pulmicort definately did NOT help and may have even made things worse.,F,1,2  months,10/13/2007,Pulmicort respules
11, 1, Asthma,My child experienced severe behavioral changes each time he went on Pulmicort.  He became irritable_ impulsive and aggressive.  We took him off the medicine and his behavior returned to normal.,,M,5,4  months,10/2/2007Email,Pulmicort respules
12, 2, asthma,My five year old has necessitated Pulmicort during allergy season. He becomes aggressive and sleepless whenever this is administered via the nebulizer. While his wheezing from the asthma does reduce_ his irritability become incessant. This medication causes him to cry (all day)_ want to fight_ and urinate in his bed (after limiting liquids). He will also wake up screaming_ even though he does not realize that he is talking. This does not occur when Pulmicort is not administered.,I am the mother of the child taking this medication. It is very expensive and should NOT be prescribed without sharing the aforementioned information to parents of kids with asthma.,F,35,2.5  years,5/20/2007,Pulmicort respules
13, 1, Whistle cough,Out of control behavior_ unreasonable hostility_ fits of rage_ irrational responses_ hyperactivity.,My 5 year old son was prescribed this meds as a nebulizer for a whistle cough. It is like the sweet_ funny child we were used to moved out and this extremely naughty_ hostile_ disruptive_ reactive child took his place. We could not reason with him at all_ he seemed unable to control his own behavior and unable to explain why he was behaving this way. It was awful. We will never use this medicine again_ or any other steroid inhaler or nasal spray.,M,5,6  months,3/17/2007Email,Pulmicort respules

15, 2, asthma,Significant behavioral problems-aggression_ emotionality at a higher dose. Overactive and exicitable at a lower dose.,My child started on this drug at age 3 1/2 and_ we thought we had a different child.  Drs. convinced us it was unrelated to the meds.  We finally discontinued at age 6 for a 'drug vacation' over the summer and were amazed at our calmer boy.  Thought it might be coincidence until the DR. wanted him back on due to illness.  After five months off_ three weeks on made OBVIOUS behavior changes.  We will NOT use this med in daily preventative way ever again!  I resent the Dr. refusing to acknowledge that behaviors ARE a side effect!,M,7,3  years,12/7/2006,Pulmicort respules
16, 2, asthma,"stunted growth_ ""yeast"" diaper rash/thrush","My now 2.5 year old took pulmicort daily (at first 2.5 twice daily_ then once) for asthma control.  I think it did offer some control_ however she still had asthma flares requiring albuterol while taking pulmicort as ""maintenance"".  I was concerned about the side effects and ""weaned"" her off pulmicort while making all kinds of ""smaller"" changes (eg_ eliminated milk products from her diet_ added magnesium_ changed some environmental factors).  In four months at the end of the taper period and off the drug she jumped from below 50%-tile in height to 75th%-tile in height.  No more diaper rash_ either.  (note: her siblings average about 80%-tile in height).  I think this stuff does work to control inflammation - but for mild-moderate asthma in children it is like using a nuclear weapon to kill the bugs in your garden_ with vigilance and research you can tread ""more lightly"" on your (or your child's) body.  Also - there are no 10-20 year out studies f",F,1,1  years,7/6/2006,Pulmicort respules
17, 1, asthma,vomitting_ hyperactivity_ infection,doctor has insisted after each attack that we give this to our 5 year old and 2 year old_ but we've stop due to side effects noted above.  Try to control with Xoponex alone_ and advair for the 8 year old.  This is not good for children.,F,2,2  years,4/8/2006,Pulmicort respules
