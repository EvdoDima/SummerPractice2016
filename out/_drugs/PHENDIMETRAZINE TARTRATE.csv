0, 1, Weight loss,Dry mouth_ exhaustion from not sleeping_ zero motivation_ depression_ suicidal thoughts,This little yellow pill turned me into a complete psycho maniac. I have never in my life behaved the way I did when I was on this pill. When I got so depressed I actually started thinking about suicide I knew something major was wrong. I started reading more about the medication and realized that's exactly what it was. Once I stopped taking them everything changed and I went back to normal. I look back now and cannot believe how much those pills took over my life and could have eventually ended it.,F,34,3  months30,6/20/2016Email,Phendimetrazine tartrate
