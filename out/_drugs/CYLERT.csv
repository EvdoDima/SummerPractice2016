0, 5, AADD,none,Got stuff done. Had muscle control issues that were resolved. Hand eye coordination improved. Actually could pay attention to what I was doing in real time instead of thinking what I should have done.,M,56,20  years112mg 1X D,5/14/2012,Cylert
1, 4, to add some perk to Marplan MAOI,Became a bit hypomanic on this med_ having too much fun_ so to speak.,It was quite pleasant and gave me the extra drive I do enjoy.  Now take Cymbalta which has good push so I don't need a supplement.  But this is an interesting med.  Originally developed for the military to help soldiers pull 24-hour shifts awake_ but it didn't work well for that.  DOES work well as a mood elevator.,M,59,1  years,3/24/2006Email,Cylert
