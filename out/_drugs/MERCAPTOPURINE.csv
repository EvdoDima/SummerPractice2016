1, 2, Crohn's Disease,Doctor prescribed it to stop rectal bleeding. Started taking it at 50 mg per day. After a month i believe_ the bleeding had stopped but my white blood cell count dropped to about 2.6. Doctor immediately lowered the dosage to 25 mg and I never had problems again but now I'm taking methotrexate instead of the 6-mp. May work for someone else but I happen to be part of the 10% that didn't respond well to it.,,M,17,7  months,8/20/2012Email,Mercaptopurine
