0, 2, Bph,Dizziness _tire_dry mouth _feeling of fainting,Good for frequency not good for the flow is a shame because u can retrograde again with flowmax no semen,M,54,6  days10mg,3/21/2016,Uroxatral
1, 2, frequent urination and incontinence,have had a headache now 6 straight days.,It helped settle the pain and urge to urinate_ but now I have no idea when I have to urinate so the incontinence is worse.,M,63,6  days10mg 1X D,12/7/2015,Uroxatral
2, 5, BPH_ Frequent Urination,Feeling of fainting then went away.,I had testicular cancer stage 2a and was treated with light rounds of radiation. 3 months later I had a hard time starting urine and sure enough my prostate was slightly inflamed from the radiation. Went to the urologist and was started on Flomax which caused retrograde ejaculation. Went back to urologist and started on uroxatral. The only side effect I had was when I stood up I would get light headed. My g/f being an RN said she knows it is a side effect. Me being an electrician climbing ladders etc..this is not a good thing but I stuck with it and about a week later the feeling of I am going to faint had dissipated completely. I did not experience any other side effects. My urine flow is great and no problem starting urine. Some patients on here advise never to take it etc..please talk to your doctor and try what you need to and do not listen to advice from people on a forum to mislead you. What works for others may not for you. I take no other meds_ I do not drink_ smoke_ I eat healthy and I am in awesome shape because of the physical activity I do everyday.,M,31,8  months10mg,9/14/2015,Uroxatral
3, 3, Overactive Bladder,Headache first 3-5 days_ get winded easily with any physical activity_ unable to lose weight.,Taking uroxatral for chronic prostatitis_ not an enlarged prostate.  For myself_ more effective than flowmax. Also experienced retrograde ejac with flowmax_ no retrograde with uroxatral.  Does cut down on bathroom trips but going to stop due to the weight problem.  Have not been able to cut weight since starting the drug.  Have stopped taking uroxatral in the past and lost weight after doing so.  Which is unfortunate because it does work.,M,38,1.5  years10 MG 1X D,1/2/2013,Uroxatral
4, 1, kidney stone,Heart palpitations_ dizziness_ trembling_ light headedness_ tiredness_ decrease in blood pressed. Every time I stand up_ I begin to feel as though I am going to faint. I already have low blood pressure most of the time_ and I have a heart murmur_ and this medication worsens each. I am a female_ and didn't know until I picked up my prescription and read the literature with it that it is not recommended for women and can interact with birth control. I was prescribed to take this medication 3 times daily. I think I would rather deal with a kidney stone than the side effects of this medication and it's potential drug interactions.,,F,28,1  days10 mg,8/19/2012,Uroxatral
5, 4, ,Worked well_,Helped wit flow especcially in AM_ no obvious side effects but found daily dose unnecessary. One dose lasts for few weeks. I resume when needed and response quick.,M,68,2  months 1X D,12/24/2011,Uroxatral
6, 2, BPH,Headache_ fatigue_ congestion,Bounced back and forth by Dr. due to side effects of Flomax and ineffectiveness of Uroxatral. Uroxatral did well in taking care of a problem with urgency_ but its effectiveness waned after about a year or so. Eventually I was back to 4-5 times per night urinating and still had issues with very weak stream/starting such that each time I got up was a 5-7 minute event. Needless to say_ my ability to have a well rested night was severely hampered.,M,50,3  years10 MG 1X D,8/24/2011,Uroxatral
7, 3, bph,Stuffy nose_ dizzyness_ light headed and heart palpitations,Started out with one dose a day. Saw rapid improvement in frequency to urinate_ almost none to one trip to the bathroom during sleep. Good flow and no more burning or urine retention during the day. Felt like a teenager again. However_ the longer I took it everyday the worse the side effects were. Saw my doctor_and basically_if I took Uroxatral everyday_ it was building up in my body. So he moved me to every other day. Alot less side effects_ but still having heart palpitations (mostly at night). Not sure at this point if the side effects are worth the cure.,M,50,60  days10 1X O,3/6/2011,Uroxatral
8, 5, bPH_ urinary retention,none noted,I have a very large prostate and have nbeen taking various drugs such  as Cardura_ Flomax and most recently Rapaflo. Due to a number of factors I developed a case of urinary retention and had to go to the ER to have a cathater installed to drain my bladder. At a follow up appointment i asked my urologist if there was a prostrate drug that did not have retrograde ejaculation as a side effect. He started me on Uroxatral and it has worked out great. Being able to ejaculate again is awesome. I could not deal with the the retrograde thing. It has been 9 days since the unary retention eposide (my first and hopefully last trip to the ER) and my bladder is working back to normal (at least normal for me),M,63,7  days1[ 1X D,12/27/2010Email,Uroxatral
9, 1, Persistant kidney stones,Sinus headache_ dry lips and mouth_ dizziness,Urologist gave me this drug to relax the ureter and help some painful kidney stones pass. Took the first dose and had experienced dry lips and eyes (in spite of pushing fluids).With the second dose_ sinus headache was off the scale_ bloody nose and dizziness ensued. I would not recommend Uroxatral as a drug therapy for kidney stones in women and gentlemen_ take note that these side effects are being reported in reviews from men as well but not listed as a problem on the drug company's advisory letter.,F,56,2  days 1X D,12/9/2010,Uroxatral
10, 4, Frequent urination,First day - headache.  I stopped for a few days and tried it again.  No headache now.,It is effective for the frequent urination symptoms.  The 10 mg dose may be a little too much.  If i skip a dose every few days it seems OK.  If I skip two days in a row the frequent urination problem starts up again.,M,69,1  months10 mg 1X D,9/17/2010,Uroxatral
11, 1, frequent urinating @ night,Extreme nasal congestion_ dry mouth_ headache; feel like a head cold,This medicine is not worth it!! The side effects are terrible and it simply does not work. Nasal congestion lingers until the next day; I feel like I have a head cold. The dry mouth is terrible! This stuff is poison and should be avoided. It amazes me the junk doctors are willing to give their patients. Not only did this drug not provide any relief for frequent urination at night_ but it caused extremely bad side effects as noted. Please DO NOT BE FOOLED into thinking it will help. Don't take it; toss it out! - And tell your doctor this stuff is pathetic. Doctors need to wake up and see the garbage they are prescribing!,M,45,7  days10 1X D,5/13/2010,Uroxatral
12, 4, improve urinary flow,Uroxatral causes sinus stuffiness for a few hours after taking but clears up within twelve hours.  Nightly frequency is now 1-2 times instead of 2-3 times_ with good flow during the day.,I tried four different alpha blockers including Uroxatral_ Flomax_ Cardura_ and Hytrin.  Hytrin had the most side effects and Uroxatral had the fewest.  These included weight gain (probably caused by water retention)_ body ache_ joint pain_ anxiety_ detached feelings_ and stuffy nose.  All improved flow_ but Uroxatral is longer acting and stays in my body for about 3 days.  This means I only take one 10 mg tablet every three days.  I have also noticed no loss of sex drive plus some male member enlargement.  Good stuff.,M,65,6  months,1/28/2009,Uroxatral
13, 3, bph,dizziness_ light headed and not very alert at times. Blocked nose is the problem and this affects normal breathing. Dry mouth as well.hope some new medications for bph sufferers are on the way soon.,,M,60,3  years,1/23/2009,Uroxatral
14, 1, BPH_ trouble urinating at night,None,I tried it for 2 weeks and found it totally ineffective for relieving problems urinating at night (mainly getting up 4-6 times).  I also tried Flomax which was slightly helpful but caused stuffy nose.  Cardura_ another alpha blocker_ worked much better but caused terrible side effects including shortness of breath_ fatigue_ dizziness_ and pre-syncope (feeling you are about to faint).Because of bad results with all these drugs_ I chose to have a TURP_ and now look forward to not having to use any of them.My suggestion:  if one of these drugs works well for you without unacceptable side effects_ stick with it.  Otherwise consider surgery.,M,70,2  weeks,11/29/2008,Uroxatral
15, 4, BPH and Prostatitis,Headaches and tiredness. symptoms become worse after drug is taken over many consecutive days. I need to skip a dose to manage headache and lethargy.,The drug is extremely effective and the side effects are generally more tolarable than Flomax which gave me severe nasal congestion and retrograde.,M,48,6  months,9/11/2008,Uroxatral
16, 4, BPH,None,I only get up once during the night which is down from 2-4 a night.  Flow has improved as being able to M T my bladder.  I chose this as oppose to flo you know who as it gave too many side effects.,M,44,10  months,1/27/2008,Uroxatral
17, 1, BPH,After only one pill I experienced extreme anxiety_ uncontrolled trembling_ and loss of mental control. Since this was a time-release pill_ these side effects continued for 19 hours!,Due to severe side effects_ I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION!Other than BPH I am a healthy individual both physically and mentally.,M,64,1  days,12/18/2007,Uroxatral
18, 5, bph_ frequent nightime urination,none,This drug is a godsend.  I didn't know how bad I had gotten until I got better.  I only get up zero or one time per night_ down from 4 or 5.  Urges during the day have diminished greatly too.,M,56,3  months,11/11/2007,Uroxatral
19, 5, relax spasms in the urinary area,None,Wonderful drug to relieve the side effects of prostate radiation. I was having urinary hesitancy_ delayed urination_ etc. from spasms in the urethra and it worked great.  You need to take it with meals to get the best results_ otherwise its effectiveness seems to be less.,M,70,3  months,7/28/2007,Uroxatral
20, 4, BPH,None.,I'm writing in because so few comments might indicate this isn't a good drug.  I studied what was available and chose this over Flomax. It works.  I went from having frequent urges to urinate_ to not having frequent urges to urinate--feel like I did when I was a teenager. I do want to make clear that prior to taking Uroxatral I took Flomax which also worked. I switched because Uroxatral (according to the medical literature) is slightly more focused on the specific problem (urges to urinate) with less side effects--e.g._ less retrograde ejaculation_ less diminution of sex drive_ less dizziness when I get up quickly_ etc.  I'm a real person living in Florida with a very busy life--so please forgive the absence of an email address.  I once gave it on a travel site and was inundated with emails.  Good luck to all of you.,M,65,2  years,7/28/2007,Uroxatral
21, 2, bph,lower back pain;  tiredness,"not covered by BlueCross (WellPoint)  co-payment;unless Dr indicates  ""no substitutions"".",M,55,4  weeks,5/28/2007,Uroxatral
22, 3, Spastic Smooth Muscles,For the first week only: mild blood pressure drop_ mild sleepiness_ & no effect on smooth muscles. After the first week there were only the positive side effects. After the first six months the positive side effects were not as potent. Certain foods and herbs that are known to cause smooth muscles to spasm_ would work against the positive effects of the medicine. If the dose is delayed within the recommend 24 hour period_ the positive side effects of this medicine quickly wears off. That's quite a reminder for me.,,M,49,8  months,4/27/2007Email,Uroxatral
