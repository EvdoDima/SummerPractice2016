0, 5, Fast Heart Rate and High BP,No side effects.,I take (1.5) 10 mg tablets per day = 15 mg.  Betaxolol is the best beta blocker I have tried (including nadolol_ carvedilol_ bystolic_ atenolol).  It keeps my resting heart rate consistently 60-70 bpm throughout the entire 24 hour day. Without it I go over 110 bpm!  My heart rate was inconsistent on other beta blockers.  Nadolol gave me Renauds syndrome.  If you take 1-2 mg of Doxazosin (alpha blocker) with your Betaxolol it should bring back the circulation to your feet and hands significantly. It did mine.,M,63,180  days15 mg 1X D,1/25/2016Email,Betaxolol hcl
