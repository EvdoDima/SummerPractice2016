0, 1, anxiety/insomia,I switched insurance plans and was given a new doctor who informed me that she doesn't believe in Xanax and refused to prescribe it_ even though I had been using Xanax with great results for a few years. I never abused Xanax..as a matter of fact I always had pills left over when my Dr would refill. Took vistaril for 2 nights. I had the most horrible dreams imaginable. Very vivid..very real...scared me half to death. Was afraid to take it during the day. I have been living with this horrible anxiety untreated for 2 years now. I don't understand how insurance companies can dictate what Dr you can see_ or how a Dr can take you off a drug that has made your life livable.,,F,57,2  days,7/31/2016,Vistaril

2, 1, Anxiety,This med made me psychotic and paranoid,I was taking zoloft for depression and last year was prescribed vistaril for anxiety.  I don't  know how I spent the last year of my life.  I don't know where I have been or what I have done. I have bits and pieces of memory.   I went missing and my family filed a missing person with the police.  The police found me in a seedy motel.  I was convulsing and had no control over my bowels and bladder.  I was unable to walk and my blood pressure was off the charts.  Taken to ER.  After many tests_ I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder_ panic attacks_ delusional_ anxiety_ and psychotic.  I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.  The psychiatrist increased the vistaril for anxiety and insomnia.  I had uncontrollable jerking and felt as if my body was infested with bugs.  I was discharged after 10 days.  I fell and broke my arm and wrist.  My behavior was out of control.  Screaming at my family_ thinking they were trying to murder my daughters.  I was taken back to the psychiatric hospital_ but was refused admission after talking to a psychiatrist.  He diagnosed me with a sleep disorder_ saying my behavior was due to lack of sleep.  I was found in another motel_ on the floor_ with a broken leg.  I was totally disabled with a broken left arm and right leg.  Back to psychiatric hospital.  Same diagnosis_ sleep disorder.  I was told to keep taking vistaril to sleep.  Months later my brother found me near death at my parents home.  Back to ER.  I was given klonapin for anxiety and final,F,60,1  years50 mg. 4X D,5/19/2016Email,Vistaril

My question is why the hell did my Dumbass Dr. give me this medicine for itching. I have a headache just reading everybody else's side effects.,This is why Dr get sued if I would have taken this medicine before looking it up on Google I would have a lawsuit against my Dumbass Dr right now.

I was prescribed it for anxiety off label_ 25mgs three times at most a day as needed. I became psychotic and paranoid after one pill. I have Bipolar1 and possible chronic psychotic symptoms underlying my mental illness_ but still---I had a very dangerous reaction. It made me do all kinds of crazy crazy stuff like change my FB profile 20 times and rant and wow my anxiety was non-existent_ get it? I had no normal reactions. Everyone laughed it off and thought I was high. I was high_ high as a kite on crack. I could have committed suicide_ I ""felt"" like killing people. Not for any reason...at all...and I knew it was wrong_ just thoughts out of nowehre! I had a whole conspiracy evolve from my dad moving out and the addresses changed after 25mgs in one day.

23, 4, Anxiety & Insomnia,twitches_ dry mouth (can be extreme at times)_ occasional lack of appetite but I'm not sure that's because of this medication,I began taking this medication for anxiety whilst in rehab for my benzodiazepine addiction_ ironically. I was referred to studies conducted comparing the efficacy of Vistaril to Ativan for long-term anxiety control. Vistaril_ over time_ far out performs benzodiazepines for anxiety AND doesn't cause dependency. I take it TID (once upon waking_ once in the afternoon_ and one at bedtime) every single day. If I don't take it or forget a dose_ I do notice an increase in anxiety_ but nothing compared to forgetting to take a Xanax or Klonopin (both of which I was prescribed for years). Anyway_ the reason I give this drug a 4/5 and not a 5/5 is for two reasons: the intense_ almost 24/7 dry mouth it causes and_ more importantly_ the restless legs and / or arms it causes along with 'feeling the need to move'.,M,24,4  months50mg TID,8/18/2015,Vistaril
24, 5, Panic Attacks,Decreased anxiety symptoms_ decreased panic attack symptoms,I started to have panic attacks during the night and would have anxiety symptoms during the day. Thought I would give Vistaril 50 mg a try b/c I don't want to use a medication that can cause dependency or effect my work. It has been great. Anxiety symptoms are gone. Panic attack symptoms have decreased to where I awaken but can reason myself out of having full blown symptomology. I am considering trying 75 mg at bedtime to see if that will stop the panic attack from occurring altogether. I have had no negative side effects. Individuals should attempt this medication prior to using an anti-anxiolytic.,F,53,7  days50,7/16/2015,Vistaril
25, 1, Anxiety,It has taken me a little while to figure out what medicine was giving me awful side effects. Vistrail is the worst med I have ever been on_ and I have been on so many. I can't remember having any noticeable side effect with ANY meds_ but this one is the Worst I could ever imagine.  Body twitching_ eyes hurt(wierd) I am so hungry_helium head_ dizzy when bending over_ which has made me fall 9 times in 6 weeks_ Hearing Voices + Noises that are not there. As I heard the voices_ in my head I knew they weren't real. Paranoid ~ I thought I heard someone in my side yard_ and it's all wooded there. I heard them crunch thru the woods_ then their truck pulling up beside my house. There was no way this was possible_ especially since I had the window closed_ AC_ fan and television on. I saw the shadows. I had the crazy dreams_ sweats_ hands trembling_ cotton mouth and muscle weakness. I'm not positive about the muscle as I have been trying to figure this out. Anyway_ my muscles twitch like crazy and even had a scalp twitch. I stood up a few times and wanted to go in the other room.,"IT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP WITH MY ANXIETY. AS A MATTER OF FACT THE VOICES_ MOVING SHADOWS_ NIGHT TERRORS_MUSCLE TWITCHES and DIZZINESS TO WHERE I KEEP FALLING...Yeah_ the Doctor was right_ this is so much better than the Xanax I'd been taking for years. The side effects of the Xanax was MY ANXIETY WENT AWAY!  Geez_ my grandfather used to say_""if it ain't broken_ don't fix it.""  I guess everyone is punished because young adults are buying and taking them. Now anyone who is on a Benzine or Opiate_ they torture you_ finding new meds. Those young adults will still get their hands on it the while others who actually need it can't.  BRAVO!",F,45,2  months50mg X 3,7/12/2015Email,Vistaril

27, 2, Anxiety,Knocked unconscious and severe swelling and pain in feet. I can't even walk or stand it is excruciating.,Works great to knock someone unconscious but I have 4 children and was prescribed this because I went to the ER shortly after my baby was born suffering from severe post partum anxiety. I explained that there are only Xanax or Valium help without making me a zombie and they gave me this crap. I asked the nurse if it would make me pass out and she told me no that it doesn't do that.  Clearly I can see that is inaccurate and I'm very disappointed in this medication as it causes severe pain in my feet so that I cannot walk for several days after just 1 pill. I have taken 3 pills this time over the course of 48 hours and my feet are still extremely painful 2 days after my last dose.,F,30,2  days50mg,6/10/2015,Vistaril

30, 1, Ended up in ER with panic attack,I have taken this medication before. ONCE a night while detoxing from alcohol almost three years ago. Made me feel loopy and tired and gave me weird dreams. THIS time I was prescribed it 4 times a day (100mg) total after an emergency visit for a severe panics attacks and thought I was having a heart attack. A few days in I noticed my hands tremoring_ had stomach aches_ weird dreams_ night sweats and heart palpitations. Last night I had to call an ambulance. I took exactly as prescribed. My my left arm and leg were tingling_ my left arm still hurts_ my BP and HR were through the roof and I was seeing stars and about to pass out. I terrified I was dying. Today my hands won't stop shaking and twitching_ my stomach hurts_ my heart is pounding like crazy and my arm is still in pain. Throwing them out... WORST THING I COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN. I suffer from GAD_ OCD_ Bipolar_ Major depression and ED. I am awaiting getting back on my Celexa and Buspar_ which together do wonders for me.

I ONLY take this when I know I am able to stay home the next day. I am literally exhausted and cannot wake up for at least 24 hours. Sure the anxiety goes away because I'm passed out!

My body is constantly craving sugar and caffeine for energy! I have noticed my self eating more and more throughout the day!

I had no problems the first day and was sleeping through the night. However_ I started seeing shadows and other visual hallucinations that progressively got worse. Then I started hearing voices. . I will say_ it did wonders for my anxiety_ but I felt like my thought process would slow way down after I took the Vistaril. The hallucinations got worse. I would see shadows whiz pass me and felt like I could not tune out the voices. I decided to stop taking it thinking no big deal_ I've only been on it a week. I was fine the first day_ but the second day I woke up with a massive migraine and spent the entire morning throwing up.

59, 5, Panic Attacks,At first I was nervous to take Vistaril; but when I woke up in the morning_ I realized that Vistaril helped me sleep throughout the night; no bad dreams at all. I took it with Lisinopril 2.5mgs to help lower the blood pressure that comes with having severe anxiety. I was a bit drowsy the next morning_ but was able to do things calm and collected.,Premature to say anything about Vistaril and its effects; but I do know that the stress that my body had is stabilized at the moment; that is 1 time dosage of 25mgs at 9:00pm. I plan to stay off it once I return to the gym_ but will continue to use my 2/5mgs of Lisinopril; because anxiety does_ and can_ cause an increase of blood pressure_ not even funny. Vistaril I used before_ but I didn't use it as recommended; now this 2nd time around I did and it did wonders. I thought I will be at the ER again with a blood pressure reading of 189/117_ but so far my blood pressure reading_ on Vistaril has been 119/70 or 129/82. Not bad!! And pulse below 80. I do not plan to take it for a duration of time; as I don't want to be zombie like or disconnected from the world. But for an emergency basis_ Vistaril has been a life savor; not to mention faith and believe in my savior Jesus.,M,42,1  days25mg 1X D,10/31/2013Email,Vistaril
