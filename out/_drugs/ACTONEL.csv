He has me very scared about my Tscore on my spine_ but I do not see anywhere that this drug has really been proven to improve bone mass.

It did a little. Good to know I wasn't going crazy with my symptoms after reading people's comments. I thought I was falling apart! The drug is expensive and the general generic version symptoms were far worse than actonel. My insurance didn't cover that much because of generic availability- I'm paying 375 bucks for 3 pills which is my share of the cost. I think I will also stop taking the drug and continue with calcium and Vit D.,,57,3  years150 mg,12/31/2015,Actonel

18, 1, Osteoperosis,The first time taking it_ I developed all the flu like symptoms within 8 hours and continued for 2 days. My doctor encouraged me to take it again as the first time is always hardest. This time seemed to be going well_ until 30 hours in I developed the absolute worst stomach pain I have ever experienced. I spent the entire night writhing in pain and I am in hour 12 and still no relief. I believe this medication is poison.,DO NOT TAKE IT.,F,50,2  months150 mg,12/6/2015,Actonel
19, 3, Severe Osteporosis,,I began taking Actonel (the generic version) four and a half years ago for severe osteoporosis.  It helped but to a limited degree_ so my doctor switched me to Prolia and I am glad he did!  At least thus far.  Actonel gave me the worst GERD I have EVER experienced and I used to dread each month when I'd take it.  I would experience GERD for weeks afterward and then about the time it began to subside_ it was time for another dose!  Worse_ it seemed to make my leg muscles VERY weak.  I have some problems in that area anyway_ but Actonel seemed to add to them tenfold.  I don't like Actonel at all even though I took it for four years.  It also seemed to blur my vision_ made my mind a bit hazy at times like I couldn't think straight and basically_ I am GLAD to be off it forever!  I will stick with Prolia.  No side effects thus far and it's a simple once every 6 month subcutaneous injection by a nurse at the hospital.  Easy_ simple_ and you're on your way!  I don't give high ratings to Actonel except that it did improve my bone density somewhat but not enough to remain on it.  And the side effects never really subsided.,F,63,4  years150 mg. 1X M,11/19/2015,Actonel

I read the side effects and I'm shocked that they don't tell you it can do long term damage. I am a VP in a large company and can't afford being out of the office. When I called my doctor he said there is nothing you can do to counter besides 2 advil 3x a day. I've been drinking water with the hope of flushing this poison out of my system.

God knows how I carried on but I didn't want my bones to get any worse.  A dexa scan after 2 years showed my hips were normal and my spine had gone from osteoporosis to osteopenia.

49, 1, Osetoporosis,I had been on Actonel for about four years but due to painful tongue and mouth_ throat and blisters on inside of mouth my doctor and I decided that I should come off the drug to try and find out what was causing my problem.  I saw two ENTs_ one dismissed me completely and the other diagnosed me with Burning Mouth Syndrome and told me that I had to live with it.  Go home and get the info from the internet.  Prior to seeing these two Specialists_ I had tried all kinds of meds to relieve my painful mouth and throat but nothing worked.  I came off the drug and after 2 years_ I was starting to feel that my mouth was only beginning to feel normal again.  Finally_ after years of not being able to taste my food and staying away from many foods_ I was starting to get back some normalcy in my life.  Then I had a Bone Density done and I was found to be at very high risk to break a bone_ so my doctor suggested I go back on this drug again.

54, 1, Borderline osteopenia,I was started on Fosamax when it first came on the market. It irritated my stomach so my gyn dr. Switched me to Actonel when it became available. After 14yrs. both my femurs broke spontaneously_ 6 mo. apart_ requiring insertion of intramedullary rods.  I had no idea that this was a result of Actonel until the 2nd. Surgeon stated  that the femurs are the strongest bones in your body and do not fracture spontaneously_ mid-shaft_ both at a 45 degree angle and stated that this was definitely caused by the Actonel.  The  bisphosphates  prevent your bones from producing natural healing elements and results in stress fractures in your bones which do not show up on x-rays.  I have also suffered a fractured pelvis and sternum in the past 5 years.,This medication has made me completely disabled with a great deal of residual pain and loss of ability to perform even simple things.  This medication is horrible and the amount of damage it is causing should be more than sufficient to have it taken off the market.  My own primary physician refuses to prescribe any bis phosphates.  Please don't take it!,F,75,14  years150 mg. 1X M,9/4/2014,Actonel

56, 1, Osteoporosis?Osteospina,I took Actonel for the first time on Sunday_ and the last!! I developed a migraine during the first day and by night time I had severe back pain that shut through the front of my chest/heart. I could only take short breaths because every time I breath deeply I would feel a stabbing pain in my heart/chest. I also felt pain in my joints on my left arm. During the night I couldn't even turn over without moaning each time. I felt pain in the spinal cord. By the next morning I felt like my whole body was aching. I also felt warm and had chills. It's the third day and I developed a rash around my neck. I also have been bedridden for the last two days on and off. I ache every time I move. I also am having upper abdominal pain since yesterday evening.,I will never take this medication again and hope no one ever takes it either. I don't want anyone to experience the same symptoms. I wish I would have done more research on this medicine before taking this med.,F,49,1  times35 mg 1X W,6/3/2014,Actonel
57, 1, Osteoporosis,Within an hour of taking the medication I started to have dizziness which lasted about 3-4 hours followed by nausea_ significant chest pain and vomiting. I initally thought that I was having a heart attack but saw that several other people also reported chest pain and had it medically checked out to find that it was not an attack. The next day the nausea continued and the joint and muscle aches at their peak_ not to mention the chest pain felt like a small elephant was sitting on top of me. Breathing was difficult to say the least. It has been 72 hours since I took my first...and need I say...last pill of this poison. My chest pain is as bad now as it was the first day but thank goodness the nausea and vomiting have subsided. I was never warned that I would have any reaction....much less one to this degree. I will never take another dose of this drug or any kind of it's class. Life is too short to take something that can do this much damage with just one dose. I can only imagine what w,,F,,1  days150 1X M,6/2/2014,Actonel

59, 1, Osteoporosis,I took my first dose of Actonel 2 days ago. Yesterday I had minor joint pain. Today I feel like I have been run over by a truck. Severe joint and muscle pain_ flu like symptoms_ headache and wasted my day bedbound. Panadeine Forte every 4 hours has had very little effect except to make me sleepy. I will Not be taking another dose of this medication and am shocked that with all of these complaints_ they are still allowed to sell it!,Think twice before taking this medication. My bone density score was very low particularly for my age so I thought taking Actonel would be a wise decision to avoid complications in later life. But the side effects I have are too much to continue taking it.,F,47,2  days35mg 1X W,4/19/2014,Actonel
