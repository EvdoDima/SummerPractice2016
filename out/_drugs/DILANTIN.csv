1, 5, seizure control,Gum overgrowth_ possible psychosis when level is too high. agitation. irritable_ fatigue,Dilantin has stopped nocturnal seizures_ some partials_ and may have reduced the overall number.  Unfortunately_ it is often elevated by other meds and when this happens there are psychological impacts_ gum overgrowth and many other side effects that aren't positive.  Still_ it's been more successful than without it.  Dilantin is normally the primary med for some and has required at least one add-on.,M,50,27  years330 1X D,7/4/2016,Dilantin

4, 5, Epilepsy,At first I couldn't take it_ it was making me sick and feeling funny. After a couple of months it worked perfect.,If your doctor tells you to take Dilantin_ no matter how you feel_ continue. Don't forget to take this medication_ take it daily. The good news is once your used to it you should be able to take it once a day_ in the morning. I went from a failure at high school to becoming a dispatcher for a huge company. i also wrote programs for the company. This is all due to the help  of dilantin. Once your on your level you will find that if something very important is about to come up such as a meeting_ one extra pill will zoom you in and focus you. Agree with this medication and you may be seizure free for years.,M,59,40  years400mg 1X D,5/5/2016Email,Dilantin

6, 5, grand mal seizures,I was put on 300 mg of Dilantin at age 16 for seizures but after a week or so_ it was reduced to 200 mg when I exhibited toxicity to it.    I have osteopenia but so did my mother_ and two of my sisters so I can not say that Dilantin has caused it.  According to an MRI done at Mayo in Rochester_ I have moderate cerebral shrinkage.  This accounts for some of my unsteadiness at times and I realize this is a side effect of Dilantin.  However at age 65_ many people have an unsteady gait so I again can not say that Dilantin did that to me.  I do not have any gum overgrowth.  I have some elevation in my ALK Phosphatase count but not enough that my neuro is concerned about it.,"At the age of 16_ I felt my life was over when I started having seizures.  Dilantin gave me my life back so that I could function normally and I married and had two sons.  No one ever told me of the side effects until after my second son was born and thank God that both of them were spared any birth defects.  I do seem to metabolize Dilantin differently and need to keep my levels up above 20 to avoid a seizure.  Just this week I learned that Dilantin is also measured in ""free"" levels  and that as long as they are between 1 and 2_ I am in the normal range.  That is still confusing to me as my last reading was 32.2 with free level at 1.7.  Along with the knowledge of my neuro_ I have lowered my dosage from 260 to 230.  He hates Dilantin because it is so hard to keep a balance on levels especially as we age.  For now_ I have no plans to switch to another drug because Dilantin has kept me safe from seizures and all drugs have side effects.  In a perfect world_ I would not have to take any drugs at all.",F,65,49  years230 1X D,2/26/2016Email,Dilantin

Every few years I have an EEG which has always shown some abnormal activity so Drs have kept me on Dilantin since I was about 17. Twice over the years I've come up toxic on blood work and had levels temporarily decreased. I've always considered the side effects worth being seizure free until this year. For the past several months I've been having trouble with being able to concentrate on things that require hand/eye coordination...like typing or sewing.. without developing a jerky muscle spasm. It also happens sometimes when the sun's extremely bright. It doesn't last long but when it does I have to stop what I'm doing and live in fear that it's a seizure coming on.

As are many people_ I'm uncertain as to the bioavailability of the new formulation_ although I am also aware that this varies greatly between patients. Final comment: If nothing else works and side effects are minimal_ the duration of use should be 5 years maximum for patients like myself (well-controlled idiopathic generalized seizure syndrome).

Effects are different for everyone_ this does not mean everything I said here will happen_ this is only from what I've experienced living on dilantin.,"I've been on dilantin for a little over 16 years and counting. Its helped me with my seizures at night. I have ones where they only happen at night in my sleep. I'm athletic and eat fairly well (semi vegetarian Is suppose lol) and in need for change. I'm done with doctors experimenting with my brain_ late in this stage I just can't handle these side effects_ it ruins a large aspect of my social life and I feel stupid around others when I'm not engaging quick enough in conversation.

This subsided soon.,I have taken Dilantin since 1965. I have been taking this once a day 3 100mg tablets before bed. I have had no side effects and my life was as normal as if I never had epilipse until June 2006 when I had a seizure. My doctor increased the dosage to 4 100mg tables _  2 taken at 11 am and 2 at 11 pm. I thought that was it for another 40 years until Thanksgiving 2009 when I had 2 seizures within 8 hours. My doctor added 2 500mg Keppra to the Dilantin. Then in Sept. 2010 _ I had a mini mal seizure where I was out for maybe a minute. What is happenning to me. Is it just because I'm getting older or because I have been taking the medication for so long ?

48, 4, Grand mal seizures,Delayed reaction times in thought. Some slurred speech -- maybe happens 2-3 times a month that I notice speech is slurred or that I can't think of the right word.,DILANTIN has worked pretty well in keeping grand mal seizures relatively well controlled (about 8-9 seizures in 10 years)_ with all of those seizures coming when the therapeutic level was low.  In fact_ the dosage may have been increased during times when compliance was the issue rather than a breakthrough seizure_ but it was hard to tell.Although the slurred speech is definitely a post-DILANTIN symptom it is really hard to tell with some of the memory/ delayed reaction issues. I definitely had some of those symptoms before diagnosis and also had insomnia issues as well. Was also diagnosed with sleep apnea_ and with the wide range of problems that sleep apnea can cause it is hard to really pin down any of those symptoms on DILANTIN or epilepsy. The sleep apnea existed before the epilepsy and it's possible they're even related. I will go through periods of drunk-like and there are times I can be at work and close my eyes for a second and suddenly be in REM sleep_ but it is still hard to tell anything if you're not getting sleep.I have had not had gum growth or recession. Overall_ it's worked pretty well and unless I addressed the other issues of insomnia/ sleep apnea it's pretty hard to justify switching when I haven't had a seizure in 2 years.,M,44,10  years460 mg 1X D,7/19/2010Email,Dilantin

On 400mg_ I feel the above side effects which affect my livelihood and social interaction.  On the dose I take_ only once in a blue moon do I feel a slightly off balanced.  I do know to take extra care of my gums and will take a bone density test when I turn 40.  I love daily products so I don't anticipate this being a problem.,My only additional comment relates to the one time in 18 years where I ran out of the medication.

Then saw an infomercial for a sub-lingual Vitamin B pill. It was pitched by a doctor we once knew in another town. Liked him. Trusted him. No mention of post-seizure_ or Dilantin_ but he claimed the stuff would help with the symptoms i was  experiencing. What the hell. We ordered some with limited expectation. About 6 weeks later we realized my condition had changed very noticeably. A couple months later I went through an exhaustive [3 hour] eval and road test to determine if I actually was ready to drive again. Bingo!Not 100%_ but I'm 73 and few in my group are. In the last year I've done all the driving on trips of 2500 miles_ and several of almost 800 miles. No sweat.Every case is different but it's worth  a try for anyone who's in comparable straights. Just be patient though. It takes a few weeks.It may not be easy to find_ but anyone on Dilantin_ considering another anti-seizure drug_ or worried about long-term use must read the Jack Dreyfuss  [the mutual fund pioneer] book: ""A Remarkable Medicine Has Been Overlooked"". I can vouch for the anti-depressant qualities.Jim",M,73,10  days,1/23/2010Email,Dilantin
56, 5, Life-extension purposes.,No adverse side-effects whatsoever.,I have taken this drug at 100 mgs daily for long spells but today take it occasionally especially if I am about to face some apprehensive social situation. It helps at maintaining one's composure. It also inceases one's stamina enabling one to do manual tasks without exhaustion. On intially taking it (the first 3 doses) I experineced a psychological high but thereafter no noticeable effect. My wife too takes it when feeing apprehensive or depressed but requires 200 mgs for her to notice its benefit. We self-medicate.,M,79,16  years,12/30/2009Email,Dilantin
57, 4, seizure disorder,Hand tremors started after 10 years of use (worse with caffeine and low blood sugar); more hair on my arms than your typical woman; get very sleepy after 1-2 beers or glasses of wine on an empty stomach; forgetful with names_ but this is part of aging for all of us!,To encourage those who worry about long term use...  Dilantin may be an oldie_ but for me it has been a goodie at 300 mg/day alternating with 400 mg/day.  I have climbed mountains_ run a half-marathon_ and not been cognitively affected at all. I am now working on my PhD in the top program in my field. Gums fine_ bone density fine (with vitamin supplements and weight bearing exercise).  I don't know what the future holds_ but Dilantin has been a blessing and a constant for me over the last 26 years.,F,33,26  years,11/23/2009,Dilantin
