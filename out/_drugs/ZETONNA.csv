0, 5, Non-allergic Rhinitis,Burning sensation immediately after use,This is the most amazing nasal spray I have used.  Traditional sprays have not worked for my non-allergic rhinitis_ and they tend to leave me with a sore throat due to drainage.  This spray does not induce drainage and the accompanying sore throat.  It also works much better than the others I have tried.  My only qualm is the hefty $100/month price tag.,F,21,3  months37 mcg 1X D,2/10/2014,Zetonna
1, 2, allergies,Upper abdominal pain_ nausea_ constipation_ sinus drainage,I am very sensitive to medications_ but this one sent me to Urgent Care thinking I was having pancreas or gall bladder problems.  The symptoms slowly crept up on me and I didn't realize the cause until I had been using it for about 2 months.  Three days after I discontinued the medication my pain and nausea were gone.  I wish I could use this because it  helped relieve some of my allergy symptoms_ but  it is just not for me.,F,64,60  days37mcg/actu 1X D,5/30/2013Email,Zetonna
2, 5, nose stuffiness,I love this stuff. I could not taste for over a year and I can now taste perfectly. It burns when you first spray it but it's worth it.,,F,54,45  days 1X D,2/28/2013,Zetonna
3, 5, Sinus Congestion,No side effects,I have been on flonase and astelin for a few years and since starting on Zetonna I have not needed astelin as often.  It works so much better than flonase.  Unfortunately it's not covered by insurance but it's worth it to me since I feel so much better being on Zetonna,F,60,2  weeks 1X D,2/20/2013Email,Zetonna
4, 2, hoarseness_ drainage,I felt agitated and irritable.  I'm not sure if this was the cause_ as I was also taking 180 mg of Allegra.  I'm leaning toward the Allegra as the cause_ but I stopped taking both.,,F,51,  1X D,9/2/2012EmailHistory,Zetonna
