0, 1, yes,Rash on face_ emotional_ sharp stomach pain_ nausea_ felt depressed. I was prescribed this for 4th relapse of c diff colitis. Flaygl didn't work_ Vancomicin was not enough by itself so my dr prescribed this. Not working even though I'm on the best drug_ according to the Dr 's_ for c diff. Finally Dr 's did colonoscopy and afterwards told me I was colonized and would never get rid of it_ and would have flares up from now on. This is hard to go through_ but other people have other illness worse than this_ so I don't want to carry on any further.,,F,43,20  days200 2X D,3/28/2014,Dificid
