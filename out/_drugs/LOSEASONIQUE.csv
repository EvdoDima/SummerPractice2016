0, 2, ovarian cysts,Migraines,"I am very sensitive to chemicals of any kind. Medications_  soaps_ perfumes_ etc.  My eggs don't like to leave my ovaries so they just swell until they can't fit and burst. Very painful. So I decided to try BC again. Because i am so sensitive I have been on SEVERAL kinds and lo seasonique was the least painful. But it is pricey and I lost my insurance_ which is why I stopped. My former doctor gave me a generic version that started with an ""a"" and immediately I became sick. Had to see her_ my primary_ get a neurologist because migraines are such a serious side effect. That was a year and a half ago. So when my new doctor suggested we try again I said it had to be lo seasonique. It was fine for the first month. But when I started the second month my anxiety started to go through the roof. I have high blood pressure to begin with so when i felt it rising it sent me into serious panic attacks and my hear would flutter. I made it half way through the second month and I got a migraine and immediately stopped.",F,27,2  months,8/18/2015,Loseasonique
1, 2, Birth Control_ Acne_ Aldactone,Tiredness and Fatigue_ increased anxiety and mild depression,The whole picture: Have struggled with acne since teen years and have taken 1 course of Accutane when I was 16. Have had generalized anxiety since teen years which is always controllable by Zoloft 100mg. Have taken YAZ and Yasmin in my 20's with no side effects. I am now 35 and have had two children and still struggle with acne so I started Aldactone and loseasonique mostly due to the pregnancy concerns while taking Aldactone. In short the Aldactone made me very tired and lethargic and increased my anxiety and also experienced depression. I stopped the Aldactone after three weeks. I was still feeling tired and slightly depressed and stopped the Loseasonique(generic) and feel like myself again. i also had breakouts on my chest and back from the birth control. In trying to figure out this ance thing_ I noticed a breakout after Easter when I had eaten a lot of sugar. I have since really limited my suagr intake and my skin has cleared remarkably!,F,35,4  weeks 1X D,4/15/2015Email,Loseasonique
2, 2, Cyst on ovary control periods,Diahrrea  nausea upset stomach cramps more sex drive which is not really that good considering i already have a sex drive thats crazy. But im kinda iffy on taking this.medicine not sure of if i want to keep continuing it.,,F,21,3  days2mg,11/20/2014,Loseasonique
3, 2, Cycle regulation _ prevent pregnanc,I have been on this for a year and have always experienced breakthrough bleeding before_ but this month_ I have bleed every day! It's ridiculous!,,F,31,1  years1x,1/13/2014,Loseasonique
4, 3, endometriosis,Breakthrough bleeding for 2 weeks_ horrible cramping_ lethargic,I've only been on this pill for 5 weeks and I'm hoping some of the problems go away with time.  I've been bleeding now for 2 weeks_ which is extremely annoying_ and I've had cramping on and off during this time period as well.  I've suffered from endometriosis for a while_ and the cramping is up there with some of the most painful cramps I've ever had.  I've also had a few days where I'm just so tired I don't feel like doing anything and just want to sleep.  I'm going to wait it out for the first full pack (3 months) and hope that I adjust to this pill!,F,26,5  weeks 1X D,6/27/2012,Loseasonique
5, 5, Control bleeding for endometriosis,Occasional night sweats_ but that's about it.  This BC seems like a walk in the park compared to all the side effects I had while on Lupron treatments and surgery. I am extremely happy with it.,,F,28,6  months,3/7/2012Email,Loseasonique
6, 4, fewer periods bc of PMDD/bipolar,Some breakthrough bleeding. Weight gain (I was underweight anyway so I'm not complaining).,"The first month I was fine_ no break through bleeding no side effects. The second and third months of the first pack I have been having a little breakthrough bleeding every day. I will take this over a full period any time but just something I have noticed. It's barely noticeable and usually only in the morning and I am bloodfree the rest of the day. I have also been cramping the past few days and breakthrough bleeding more than usual but I'm supposed to start the ""period week"" next week.",F,21,2.5  months 1X D,7/27/2011Email,Loseasonique
7, 4, endometriosis,my hair did fall out after 2 months.  I have gained 10 lbs.  The appetite did seem increased from before I was taking Yazz.   Also my breast are larger which I did not need.,I have a history of endometriosis. I went on Yazz years ago when my estrogen was low.  Lately_ it seemed more increased that I started having uterine contractions and migraines.  It has really helped with the periods and contractions that I like it for that but I have not enjoyed the side effects.,F,46,4  months 1X D,5/1/2011,Loseasonique

9, 3, Dysmennorhea,Breast swelling & pain. 16+ days of bleeding. Some acne.,I was very hopeful about taking this medication as I have extremely painful periods both before & during menstruation in which the pain can last up to 2 weeks. I started the medication mid period and 4 weeks later by the time I got to the next period I began bleeding lightly and the bleeding has continued for 16+ days now. I have never had a period for more than 5 to 6 days. I have actually been bleeding more the past few days than I did at the beginnning. I have also been getting zits on my face:( I am discontunuing the medication & hope I will stop bleeding soon. I do not have the severe pain as I typically do during normal menstruation_ but the incessant bleeding is getting rediculous. I did like having bigger boobs though_ except for the fact that they hurt really bad.,F,31,6  weeks0.1/0.02mg 1X D,6/8/2010Email,Loseasonique
10, 3, PMDD_ cycle regulation,High blood pressure_ fatigue_ hunger,I had great hopes that this would work for me_ but it didn't.  I usually experience migraines with bcp's_ but did not with this.  Everything seemed okay until week four when I experienced my heart racing and fluttering.  A trip to my pcp confirmed my blood pressure was high.  After I had my second child_ I became very sensitive to medications_ and it seems that I'm just not going to be able to take any oral contraceptives.  But on the whole_ I did not have many of the other side effects women experience on this.,F,35,1  months 1X D,3/5/2010,Loseasonique
11, 4, acne & wanted fewer periods,"developed a different smell ""down there"" (maybe b/c it changed the chemistry?); decreased sex drive",I had been on ortho tri-cyclen previously for many years_ and wanted similar results for clearing acne_ but to have fewer periods.  It seemed that as long as I took the pill within the same 3-4 hour period each morning_ breakthrough bleeding was avoided.  It did clear my acne_ although not as well as ortho-tri cyclen. However_ because of the added benefit of not having a period but once every three months_ I'll probably stay on this.  No cramps_ no breast tenderness_ no mood swings on this_ which I was getting before I started this.  Period started after missing two pills.,F,31,42  days,1/8/2010,Loseasonique
12, 4, Birth control_ anemia,Painful cramping_ dull headaches_ insomnia for the first couple of weeks_ tired_ breakthrough spotting/bleeding_ breast tenderness.,I talked to my doctor about an oral contraceptive he would recommend to a girl like me (prone to anemia_ vegetarian) after my boyfriend kept pestering me to get on the pill. My doctor recommended LoSeasonique saying his two daughters take it_ one of them being vegetarian. I'm on month four of it and I can say I am satisfied. I get very nervous when taking prescription drugs and was disappointed when I got the common side effects of cramps_ headaches_ breakthrough bleeding etc. They were bad the 1st 2 weeks but subsided thereafter and have slowly disappeared. I did get breakthrough bleeding again for 2 weeks before the low dose estrogen pills_ however. There is an unexpected benefit that has influenced my liking of this medication. With no periods_ I have not had mood swings. Before every period_ I would get really depressed_ anxious and irritable. That has all been eliminated since I've been on the medication. Oh_ and this medication is REALLY pricey_ so be prepared to shell out some cash when your sample runs out. :/,F,20,3  months,10/19/2009,Loseasonique
