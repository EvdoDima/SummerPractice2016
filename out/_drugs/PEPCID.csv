3, 2, GERD,Third dose made me have heart palpitations. Shortly after I started having small sharp pains in my back_ shoulders_ sides and sometimes legs/feet/stomach_ which seemed to only get worse with further usage.I already had anxiety related to my chest pain/indigestion and this drug only made it worse_ before usage I had managed to relieve myself of most symptoms but they came back like a train upon usage.Fifth day I received a golf ball sized bruise by using a wash clothe and it scared me enough to discontinue usage.,I will no longer take this medication_ I have a follow up appointment in a few weeks with a physician.

Couldn't function_ couldn't think_ didn't know what I was doing.  Get off of it as fast as you can.  I'm glad I didn't listen to the doctor.

21, 1, Acid Reflux,"Sudden and severe anxiety.  I never had any anxiety issues in my life so when it felt like my life was falling down around me and the world was going to come to an end within a few days of taking this drug_ I figured it was the Pepcid.  I went off the Pepcid and within 24 hours I started to calm down.  Within 4-5 days the anxiety went away by the 10th day off of Pepcid_ I was completely back to my happy_ normal self.  On a side note_ I took a 150mg Zantac pill about 4 months later for acid reflux (have taken Zantac 75mg before with no problems) and this larger dose brought on another milder episode of anxiety.  Now_ I stay completely away from proton pump inhibitors.  I use mastic gum at times and alternate with slippery elm bark to control my acid reflux.  I also occasionally drink a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water (Bragg's brand with the ""mother"" is organic and has all the apple debris in the bottle that holds all the true healing nutrients_ etc.).

25, 2, acid reflux,My experience was awful. All of my side effects were as follows: pounding heart beat_ headaches_ muscle pain and stiffness_ gitters_ anxiety_ and tiredness/weekness.

29, 1, GERD,I only took two doses of this medication.  The first night_ about two hours after I took one pill_ I had this awful_ bitter medicinal taste coming up my throat into my sinuses.  I had a pretty bad panic attack_ too.  I felt pretty certain at the time that these things were tied to the Pepcid.  The next day_ though_ my symptoms returned so I decided to give the medication another chance.  That time_ not only did I have a panic attack_ but I vomited bitter pill foam and broke out in a burning rash on both of my arms.,,F,38,2  days20 MG 2X D,12/12/2013Email,Pepcid
30, 1, heartburn,the Pepcid Complete got rid of my heartburn but suddenly I started awakening to my heart racing and last two days ago my heart was skipping a beat and racing. Didn't connect it to the pepcid; thought it was a panic attack or stress. But now that I have read side effects on the internet_ I am thinking it was the pepcid. Too dangerous for me to take. Would not refer it to anyone .....,,F,64,30  days10mg 1X D,12/2/2013,Pepcid

I been off this medicine for a week now I still feel a little nervous but not nothing like I was before. I'm also sleeping better. I turned to drinking apple cider vinegar 2tsp in water 2x a day. Its working pretty good for me. Lastly this drug is bad for you I would not recommend anyone to take it or any meds in its family.,,F,26,2  years20mg,9/7/2013,Pepcid
32, 1, Acid Reflux,Body pain and stiffness in upper and lower extremities_ including calves_ ankles_ feet_ and toes and fingertips_ tingling_ jitteriness_ heart palpitations_ light-headedness_,I started Pepcid OTC 20 mg once daily.  Didn't realize my problems that started were due to Pepcid as I originally started out with pain and tingling in my breasts. Breast ultrasound was normal.  Pain and stiffness started in my left leg at my knee and included my knee_ calf_ ankle_ foot_ and toes.  This spread to both my legs and into my thighs_ arms_ and fingertips.  Saw my doctor who didn't say anything about side effects and actually asked me to increase dose to 40 mg a day.  Had blood tests which was normal.  After a week and a half_ I have developed heart palpitations_ light-headedness and constant body pain.  EKG showed abnormals sinus rhythm but Dr. thought it was due to caffeine.  I think now two days later if heart palpitations was caffeine related_ my symptoms would be gone but that wouldn't explain the body pain.  I had an MRI and am waiting results_ but I am convinced my problems are related to the pepcid after reading others' comments.  I will see how my weekend goes without pepcid and if my symptoms improve.,F,43,30  days20 2X D,5/3/2013Email,Pepcid
33, 3, Reflux,I started taking Pepcid 8 days ago due to gastric reflux.  I began having all kinds of weird symptoms that I never associated with Pepcid until I read all of these testimonials.  I couldn't figure out why I was having severe chest pressure with shortness of breath.  I was having extreme anxiety attacks along with this chest pressure.  These episodes would completely resolve themselves_ but would come back at unexpected moments.  It was very scary!  After reading these testimonials I am certain Pepcid is causing all of this!  It would happen to me shortly after taking the med every time.  I just never associated it together until now.,,F,43,8  days20mg,10/28/2012,Pepcid
34, 1, gerd,Originally started taking this for severe GERD and possible ulcers.

35, 1, ,I was put on prescription strength famotidine for a possible case of GERD.  For the first week or so I had an adjustment period getting use to the heart palpitations and so on.  After that it seemed to work.  By week 6_ it seemed to have the reverse effect.  I would suffer from stomach pains each time I took it.  I even went to a new GI doctor for a second opinion on the GERD.  He insisted that it could not be the famotidine that was casuing my distress.  After a brief ER visit_ thinking I was having a heart attack I decided to quit - WOW talk about acid rebound!  My doctor put me on a PPI - after about a week I decided I didn't want to be stuck on that too.  I am on day 4 without any kind of acid suppression - life stinks right now!,,F,38,60  days40 mg 2X D,10/30/2011,Pepcid
36, 1, Acid Reflux,After several weeks of taking Pepcid AC_ my ears started to ring and ache.  But it was helping with my acid reflux so I continued to take the medication in spite of the ringing and pain.  Eventually_ the pain and ringing became  severe so I stopped taking the medication. The pain went away immediately_ but the ringing still remains.  I have been waiting about two years for the ringing to subside_ but it has not.  Unfortunately_ taking Pepcid AC has resulted in permanent hearing damage.,This medication worked well for my acid reflux_ but I wish I had been aware that the ear ringing was possibly a serious and permanent side effect.

37, 1, acid reflux,Lowered platelet count_ easy bruising_ profuse nose bleeds needing cauterization,I have taken Pepcid for over ten years for acid reflux.  About a year and a half ago_ I started getting nosebleeds so bad that I ended up in the ER on several occasions.  In addition_ I would bruise easily and had blood in my urine.  The doctors could not discern the cause.  I finally looked up the side effects of what I believed was an innocuous drug (pepcid)_ but the side effects matched exactly with my symptoms - bleeding and depression.  Never again will I take this drug . . .,F,65,10  years20mg 1X D,5/8/2011Email,Pepcid

39, 2, acid reflux,I took Pepcid occasionally for acid reflux for over ten years.  It would work on the reflux_ but seemed to weaken my digestion so I'd start having sour stomach_ belching sometimes severe enough to be nauseous.  It's taken a long time to make the connection but I believe that the Pepcid is responsible.  Also after reading other comments here I realize I may have had emotional side effects of depression as well.,I always though Pepcid was one of the safest medications out there - I even gave it to my elderly cat for her stomach trouble.  This experience shows me there is NO chemical medication that can be taken without extreme care.  My natural remedies for reflux are Cats Claw_ Schizandra_ and Bragg's apple cider vinegar.  None of those work as completely or quickly as Pepcid but it's preferable to the side effects.,F,41,11  years10mg 1X D,6/29/2010,Pepcid
40, 2, gerd,It helped with my heartburn and gerd.  Weird thing was that I started developing anxiety attacks (sometimes severe) and very emotional & agitated.  Started getting depressed and emotions were on a roller coaster.  Didn't associate it with Pepcid until I just happened to check the side effects.  I stopped taking it yesterday and I hope to be better in a few days.  I started taking Pepcid because of the bad side effects I had from Protonix.  Gave me severe migraines 24 hours a day with nausea.  Took me 10 days to figure it out.  I had been on that 2 weeks before those symptoms occurred.  Two days later_ no more migraines. I would not suggest either medicine to anyone.,,F,49,20  days20 mg 1X D,5/2/2010,Pepcid

42, 3, acid reflux/barrett's esoph,Have been taking pepcid for four years and it helped with acid reflux for the most part.  Four months ago_ I began having severe anxiety and depression.  After going through a thorough exam_ nothing was found.  I discontinued taking pepcid for one reason or another and found myself feeling better with the depression isssues_ however due to my acid reflux had to start again.  I found myself very anxious and nervous and aggitated when I took it.  I continued taking for several days and these issues didn't resolve.  I stopped again and felt better again.  Went off pepcid again last week and felt much better with anxiety and depression and nervousness.  Had to take pepcid lastnight due to terrible acid reflux and within 1 1/2 hours was having crying episodes for no reason at all along with aggitation and nervousness.  I am convinced now that the pepcid plays a role in these psychiatric disorders.  If anyone including the Dr. says no way_ I am here to say WAY!!!!!!,,F,45, ,12/3/2009,Pepcid
43, 2, GERD,"Well when I first started taking pepcid I felt a little disoriented. After about a week this feeling went away and everything was fine_ the stuff worked great. However_ sometime last week I kept getting constant headaches. Everyday I had a headache_ then came the heart palpitations_ confusion_ severe lower back pain and blurred vision. I actually started wondering if I was being poisoned. I'm only 30_ never had any problems like this before. I stopped taking this ""poison"" 2 days ago and am now feeling relief. However still have some blurred vision. Ill take the heartburn.",,M,30,4  weeks,9/7/2009,Pepcid
44, 1, Hospital gave it in place of Nexium,Within 15 minutes of them giving me the Pepcid I became combative.  I was in the hospital at the time and I had already been dehyrated and was experiencing a side effect from the Zpak along with my normal acid reflex reducer medicines when they decided to give me pepcid and I freaked out.  I tried to get out of bed_ I became very anxious.  This happened both times they gave me the pepcid in the hospital.  Since then I have decided to try a natural cure for my acid reflex.  The Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar drink which is on the side of the bottle.  We'll see if it works.,,M,28,1  days,6/14/2009Email,Pepcid

47, 1, acid reflux_ upset stomach,Worked fine for about a year - 20-40mg/daily really reduced stomach acids_ then severe panic attacks with mental confusion and breathing difficulty set in from nowhere! Didn't realize it was Pepcid_ so I kept taking it.  The attacks grew worse and more frequent_ especially at night! I went online and read the possible side effects. Although rare_ some patients reported experiencing anxiety attacks.  I stopped taking the drug 3 years ago_ but still to this day have an occasional panic attack.   Seeking an alternative to Pepcid_ I recently tried Tagamet (Acid blocker) which I had taken with no side effects approximately 1 year for a stomach ulcer in the late 1980s.  To my horror_ I suffered the same exact result!  I'm no medical professional_ but I assume I've developed a sensitivity to these types of medications.  I now have to take prescription Celexa as needed whenever the panic symptoms occur.  I use liquid OTC antacids for occasional stomach symptoms_ AND I stopped drinking coffee!,I would not recommend this stuff to anyone!  Other than very occasional acid reflux and seasonal allergies_ I am a very_ very healthy individual who has not had any family history of heart problems_ mental disorders or depression.  The panic/anxiety attacks I suffered were extremely frightening_ extremely real_ and on a level of intensity that landed me several times in emergency rooms! I thought I was having heart attacks and on the verge of death.

If I stop using it will my hair loss stop?,Over the years I tried everything to treat the symptoms. Pepsid has really helped. I have recommended it to many people.  I don't know how I could manage the acid reflux and indigestion without it.

51, 3, Suspected GERD,After fourth dose I felt intense anxiety_ a racing heart (for hours)_ had panic attacks_ a stomach ache_ and felt shaky all over including inside my stomach.  After the first dose_ I had occasional ringing in ears and a feeling chills or cold which I also felt after subsequent doses.,Doctor suggested I try an OTC acid reducer to see if it would help vocal chord and throat problems I had been experiencing for a few weeks.  I am EXTREMELY sensitive to medication so I always use extreme caution when starting.  I bought Pepcid Complete so that I could break the chewable tablet and start with a really low dose.  After the fourth dose_ almost a complete tablet taken shortly before bed_ I woke up in the middle of the night with my heart racing_ experienced a panic attack and felt like I had chills.  Later in the morning I had a stomach ache and could barely eat breakfast.  I felt on edge and restless much of the day afterward.  After this fourth_ pill_ however_ throat symptoms were greatly alleviated (hoarseness_ sharp burning pain on right vocal chord).  I am unsure what my next step is_ as I finally felt some throat relief for the first time in 8 weeks.,F,36,2  days,7/13/2006,Pepcid

Well about 15 years ago I began to have problems w/ depression!I've been seeking holistic aids for the reflux which by the way was successfully treated w/ pepsid. Ready for this?  I heard that taking 2 tbls of vinegar can stop it so I gave it a shot. Burned like heck going down but about 5 min later   NO REFLUX! And I was fine all night through the sleep hours. This is all recent so we shall see over the long term weather my mood gets better but I have a feeling it will. I'm told for long term natural cure of acid reflux thata 20 day regiment of Orange Peel Extract works. I am trying it now so I will report back.,it reduces acid which is needed for digestion and the break down of nutrients and minerals. Think about that....,M,48,15  years,10/14/2004Email,Pepcid
