0, 1, low oxygen levels,i am 60 years old_ have had asthma since birth_ or so they tell me_ have not had an asthma attack since i was in my early teens. Have had low oxygen levels my entire life. Had pneumonia last year_ started out with a little congestion_ should of went to doctor for medicine_ did not_ so ended up with pneumonia. I have been pretty healthy most of my life_ in fact i do not get sick_ except for this stupid pneumonia i got last year (also had chest congestion about 10 years ago and pneumonia about 25 years ago) Now they decided i should be on all the drugs_ tried inhaler_ it almost killed me. now doing albuterol with something else in nebulizer treatments.  My breathing is steadly getting worse_ my mental state of mind is getting worse. The medicine is awful_ i have quit taking it and am hoping that it is not too late to get back to how i was.  Why do the doctors not realize that low oxygen levels can be caused by the pulminary vein narrowing.  But evidently they will not check that because,this is not a medicine physicians should prescribe,F,60,20  days 2X D,2/28/2016Email,Albuterol

5, 5, Asthma,I have been taking albuterol for 20 years and have had very few side effects unless my asthma is not doing well and I take too much of it.  This can make me nervous_ and my heart race.  It can also make you a little nervous and shaky when you first start taking it until your body gets used to it.  It can cause insomnia if you take it too close to bedtime so I take it about 30 minutes before I go to sleep to avoid that.,Would recommend.  It has been a life-saver for me.,F,40,20  years,6/12/2008,Albuterol
