0, 3, Having headaches daily,Headaches and swelling. Pain in stomach.,I am only allowed to take no more than two a day and three a week. When I am out for that week I have to wait until the week is over to take anything else. Did not know that it would make my stomach problems worse.,F,37,6  months15mg,8/1/2016Email,Cambia
1, 5, Migraine headache,Took 1 daily as needed with migraine. Best thing ever.,Cannot afford $900 before meeting deductible_ then $200 copay after deductible.  Shame on pharmaceutical company.  Needless to say_ cannot afford to take this medication.,F,53,1  days50 mg pwdr 1X D,3/23/2015,Cambia
2, 1, Migraines,Because of aspartame component I experienced worse migraines.,If aspartame is a trigger for your migraines_ do NOT take this. Most doctors will say it is such a small amount that it will not matter. It does!,F,31,2  weeks1 pkt 1X D,5/3/2013Email,Cambia
3, 2, Migraine,Tastes gross -- heavy mint flavor. Felt like it was burning my esophagus all the way down_ then dry heaves once it hit my stomach. But it didn't make me actually vomit_ and the burning sensation went away quickly.,Was prescribed Cambia as a backup to Maxalt_ since triptans can be taken only 2 days/week. Unfortunately_ it didn't work at all on my migraines_ so I'll continue to look for something else as a backup.,F,47, 50 mg 1X AN,11/14/2012,Cambia
4, 5, migraines,Once I had bad nausea due to taking it on an empty stomach. Also causes bleeding problems.,Stops migraine immediately when taken early on when all others didn't. If I wait I have to take two doses. Easy to take - a powder in a small amount of water. It is an anti-inflammatory_ not a hypnotic. My insurance only pays for 4 doses a month_ less than I need_ and paying for it without insurance is too expensive.,F,62,1  years50 mg 1X AN,5/24/2012,Cambia
