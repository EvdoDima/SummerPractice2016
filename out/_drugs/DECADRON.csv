20, 5, Addison's disease,Slight muscle ache sometimes_ usually in my arms or wrists. I was put on this medication when I was first diagnosed with Addisons. I noticed an increase in my appetite_ but somehow I actually lost several pounds on this medication without even trying. It was really nice because I did not lose weight from Addisons itself_ which usually causes weight loss before it is treated. It improved my symptoms completely_ I felt normal again_ with enough energy to live life! My doctor worked me down to 1 mg a day_ and then switched me to hydrocortisone. Since starting hydrocortisone 3 months ago_ I still feel normal and energized_ but I have gained 30 lbs. I wish I could go back on dexamethasone because it didn't have that side effect for me_ but since I have to be on steroids for the rest of my life_ I can't (dexamethasone builds up in the body_ hydrocortisone doesn't). Anyway_ I liked this medication.,,F,20,3  months4mg-->1 mg,10/1/2014,Decadron

24, 1, brain tumor that spread from lung,Mother in-law took it.it did its job of keeping the swelling in brain down after radiation treatments.she was however never able to get off of it because her body was so used it to it and couldnt adjust to being off of it.when she tried getting off of it all she did was throw up and lost alot of weight. When on it she had major muscle weakness_couldnt get up on her own and could no longer walk.and as it was upped she had halucinations and began to have some dementia.decadron is evil and it kills. I firmly beleive its what killed her because her cancer was responding to treatment.She ended up having no quality of life and died 9 months after starting it. There are other steroids out there_ so only use decadron as a very last resort.i wish it was never made and hope one day it is no longer used because all it does is kill you.,,F,64,9  months2mg-6mg,4/20/2014Email,Decadron

I forced myself to not attack her and I've never felt anything like that in my life. When I returned the next day for my second day of chemo the nurse asked me what I was feeling and as soon as I told them I felt like I was dying THEY KNEW it was Decadron and removed it from my treatment.  I gradually felt better within days but I was told I had the opposite reaction to the drug that was supposed to give me euphoria.  I also have the opposite reaction with other steroids.  Once with a frozen shoulder I received a steriod shot for pain and the following pain was truly unbearable for days.

Blood pressure issues_ Very low hearth rate ( under 50 while sitting). Fog minded,This is my DAD. My mom is the main caretaker. The main issue was the jekyll and hyde like switch of the person. When the steroid hit his system he became Mr Hyde. A completely different person. when the dose was reduced to 1MG a day be was then become like a very old 90 year nice man that just sites and watches TV only of others turn it on first. Also the lost of balance stopped and he whent from a whell chair to slow walking with no help. Now with a new treatment they have infected him with more steroid with the other chemo and again Mr Hyde is back and mean as ever. Now that we know what is causing the issue we will be looking into stopping the steroid use. My dad is completely incompatible with the hellish drug.

36, 3, Bee Sting - intense swelling,Agitation/Anger/Rage,My 14 y/o son was given this medication through injection just above he buttocks to help with swelling and pain from a bee sting. He seemed crabby on and off all afternoon_ but by about 8:30 that night he was beyond aggitated. He got mad about not being able to watch a movie and flipped out. Screaming and yelling and babbling about things that made no sense. My son NEVER behaves this way. I thought almost immediately that this had to be a reaction the that shot. This fit lasted about an hour_ to the point that I was about to get him in the card and take him to the ER. He got himself so worked up that I was certain he was going to pass out because he couldn't breathe. When we finally were able to calm him down and get him to catch his breath_ we settled him into his bed and I listened to him cry himself to sleep. This is not normal behavior. I called the Doc's office this morning and was told that it was_ indeed_ a reaction to the Decordron.,M,14,1  days1 Shot 1X D,5/29/2012Email,Decadron
37, 1, Cancer,My mother was on this drug for 2 weeks after receiving radiation treatment for a brain tumor. She had stage iv breast cancer that had spread to the lungs and then the brain. Up until she took this drug she was her normal_ wonderful self. Decadron robbed my family of the final 2 weeks of my mothers life. She became the EXACT OPPOSITE person. Yelling hateful things at us_ acting crazy and refusing any help. She was a strong Christian and on this drug as she was praying she would pray to the 'dark power' and ask for the good to be overcome by evil. It was the most difficult thing I have ever experienced. Months later I researched and found countless other similar stories_ including many here. There are better options and this drug should be taken off the market.

Negative - Taking this medication on a busy day at work when you can't eat.  Your blood sugar will drop suddenly and you will have to stop and eat.  Pros- No pain anywhere on my body.  I organized my house and cleaned it from top to bottom_ manicured my yard at 3:00 am with a flashlight in hand.  I had the energy of 10 people and got more done in that one week on decadron than the whole year off of it.   This drug was like an energy pill for me_ physically and mentally.

She was given haldol to take to counter hallucinations. I'm wondering how long this will last. This is not my wife and it is terrifying.

58, 4, Brain Tumor ICP brain swelling,"Hot flashes_ severe ""moon face""  appetite increase_ insomnia_ joint pain_ shaky all the time_ heart palpitations_ can't even hold a fork right without tremors_ eye dryness or pressure",I never experienecd the euphoria some people reference_ but it does help with the swelling significantly.  The pain experienced with it is definitely unpleasant but trying to manage.  The tremors are constant and the moon face is surprising although I monitor my diet and haven't gained as much weight_ but cravings are unbelievable....difficult to manage and make sure I don't go overboard on things.  Often hungry during sleep even_ have woken up from pain in joints/muscles and struggle to fall/stay asleep.,F,30,30  days12mg 2X D,6/24/2011Email,Decadron
59, 4, Brain Tumor Radiation/Chemo,Swelling in knees_ ankles_ face.  Unrelenting appetite which led to weight gain.  Acne on chest_ back_ upper arms_ and face.  Racing heart_ jittery hands.  Impossible to get a full night of sleep (3 uninterrupted hours was a GOOD night).,Decadron was a necessary evil.  If I hadn't been taking this nastiness_ my brain would have continued to be inflamed_ causing me more massive headaches and making my life hell.  I would say the worst side effects were the appetite/weight gain_ swelling_ and the acne.  No 29 year old wants to look like they're 16 again!,M,29,2  months3MG 2X D,6/20/2011,Decadron
