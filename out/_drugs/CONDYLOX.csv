2, 5, Genital warts,Burns like hell and gets worse every application. HORRIBLE odor like you couldn't imagine_ itches,Wear maxi pads and change them often. When you feel itchy or wet kinda like you're sweating be sure to make it to a restroom_ change_ and pat dry. It's awful but it works!! Mine were pretty far spread and I have one cluster right in my anus that's taking the longest,F,25,5  days,3/1/2016,Condylox
3, 5, Genital warts- external labia,None.  Mild tingle maybe.  No pain,I applied pretty liberally to a small cluster and a couple small strays. By the end of the treatment cycle (3 days/twice a day) they were gone.  Used a vagisil cream on interior labia only to protect it just in case.  They turn white with application_ and then just kind of shrivel off and fall off. I think the last one I kinda plucked off.  Now 2 mths later_ they're back so now on day 1 of another cycle.  Allowed maybe a minute of dry time. Completely painless_ no odor.  Nothing- just gone,F,37,1  daysSolution,2/21/2016Email,Condylox
4, 4, Condylox,Like everyone else -- first time I was generous with the application and suffered for it. Warts/skin begin to rot_ burn and bleed. The warts (or what I think are warts) turn black and usually fall off when I'm scrubbing in the shower. (Not sure if I should even be scrubbing the area or if I should just leave it alone_ actually.) I'm currently on my second round of using it--three months later first case--as more have appeared.,A few people mentioned having used it multiple times. I'm interested in hearing peoples' experience with reoccurring breakouts. I'm on my second in a span of three months.Quick backstory: Not sure where I got it. My ex and I we were together 9 months (stopped using condoms after a couple weeks) and were both orally-inclined. If she or I had any visible warts_ we definitely would have noticed. We broke up in September. Guess who pops up in October when I'm ready to jump back in the dating game? Four lil homies at the base of my penis. Went to the doctor in October and got condylox. I used it and it cleared up. Notified my ex about it--she's got an appointment with her OBGYN coming soon. (Should have told her when I first noticed them and maybe I wouldn't have burned the hell out of my penis applying this stuff incorrectly the first time.)It's early January now. Guess who's back? Three more lil homies.How many of you using this product have experienced reoccurring warts? Are any other products better than condylox? Has anyone gone a solid year without another outbreak? And_ I realize this isn't a forum_ how do you disclose it to past/current/future partners? Please message me and share here if you have any insights.Thanks for reading_ and may you never see these little fuckers again!,M,32,  2X D,1/6/2016Email,Condylox
5, 3, GW,None.,So I am on day 3_ of application and reading all the comments. I have experienced none of the side effects of what's being posted right now_ which is scarier to me then the side effects. Its a liquid in a very tiny bottle and comes with the qtips. I have been very liberal with application and I came to this side because I was worried that it was not working. I would expect some burn or tenderness because it was described as an acid_ but to get nothing scares me. If anyone has had a similar experience please contact me.,M,23,3  days 2X D,11/27/2015Email,Condylox
6, 3, hvp bumbs,So much pain!,It didn't hurt the days I was applying it...a little burning but nothing I couldn't handle. I only used it for 2 days because my warts turned white and it was becoming painful. As the days went on it became more and more painful. I didn't know about letting it dry..so I think it spread all over. I have spots where the gel ate through my skin. this has been the most painful experience of my life. It hurt to walk_ sit_ move. It was unbearable. The only relief I found was taking a bath and that was only temporary. The pain has eased a little since. Its been 8 days now since I used the gel and my wounds have not healed yet. Its so uncomfortable and burns when I pee and so painful to wipe. As far as I can tell my warts fell off_ but the area is so swollen and covered with open sores_ it's kinda hard to tell for sure. I will never use this again. The pain is unimaginable.,F,27,2  days,11/7/2015Email,Condylox
7, 5, Treatment of GW,So I'm now on my second round. Your supposed to do 3 days on (2 treatments a day) and 4 days of. Repeat up to 4 times. So 2 treatments a day would be 6 doses. Well after the 2nd dose it started getting more and more unbearable_ so I only got through 5 doses. It was excruciating. The pain_ itching_ stinging. I had to use frozen bags of edamame to ice down there. I thought I would never do it again. But once I saw the results that was another story. It worked amazingly_ and I had a lot of both vaginal and anal warts. So there were like two spots that looked gone but questionable_ so I decided since it was such a small surface area_ I could bear one more treatment. On day two of that.,Use a hand mirror. Don't use too much. Make sure you let it dry!! Oh and I found it helpful to tuck folded toilet paper between my labia and butt where I was treating. It'll start to kinda leak fluid/ puss and it'll itch like crazy if the area is rubbing other skin. Call off of work. The pain is worth the results if you can bear it.,F,29,3  days.5%,11/2/2015,Condylox
8, 4, HPV (SEVERE_ 2 HIGH RISK STRANDS),Burning_ swelling_ flu like symptoms_ nausea_ and tremendous pain.,"After switching doctor after doctor due to the fact they would not help me with my condition_ I have a terrible case of HPV. My current doctor even described it as the ""worst she has ever seen"". Please take note that my review is for those who are suffering the same hurdles I am when it comes to this virus. I administered this to two large wart sites and by god it burns like a heffer. I had crazy side effects and even had to take Narco to go to bed last night. However_ it is noted that you should only take this in small quantities and I was using it in two large areas so this could be why the side effects were so severe. I can barely walk due to the yeast infection this has given me and has caused swelling. I just picked up Monostat today to use. Although_ despite it's torture_ I can say it has successfully killed my two large wart sites (they have not ""sloughed"" off yet_ but they are whiter than white) and a few have been removed from my body and this is only on day five. Both wart sites are painful; however_ Neosporin 24 hour infection protection and pain relief has been helping with both sites. I will be waiting a while before I use the second treatment so I can fully recover since I did attack the two largest sites I have and now all I have to tackle is the little ones. This is no joke_ but it gets the job done and if you are like me_ where the warts are so bad they place you in discomfort on a day to day basis_ this is the gel for you.",F,22,5  days0.5% 2X D,9/21/2015,Condylox

Anyway i have one dime sized wart by rectum. I am 2 doses down with 1 coming tonight. Trying my best to keep it off healthy skin. The wart turned white. Now it hurts like nothing I've ever felt. Hurts_ sitting_ standing_ laying down_ heck it hurts in every possible position. I'm really tempted to just put duct tape on both my cheeks so they don't have to rub on each other.

16, 4, Anal Warts HPV,Burning_ white flaky skin_ some bleeding_ odor,Saw 2 pimple-looking bumps around my rectum and didn't think anything of it for a couple of weeks. Went to the doctor and was told I had warts_ take the cream_ and basically move on with my life as though it was no big deal. Would love it if they never come back. As others have said_ only apply this stuff to the warts. It will burn like crazy. I just finished the 3 days of treatment_ and it sounds like I am in for a painful few days judging by what I'm reading from others. Bottom line: it is SO easy to get HPV_ especially around your anus.

17, 4, GW,"I was diagnosed with GW Tuesday last week. Had them for about a month before I could actually be seen by a doctor. I figured I had it after researching in my agonizing time waiting to be seen.  Once diagnosed I was given the ""4 out of 5 people have this its common"" speech. needless to say I'm bitter_ and I want these disgusting things to go away and never cone back. I was prescribed condylox_prodoylox comes in a tiny bottle with little q-tips for application. I had clusters of tiny warts maybe 8-10 pet side on the bottom of my vagina and then small individual warts around my anus.  My fiance applied the medicine to my warts for me twice a day for three days. I'm on my first rest day. My clusters are gone no warts.  I have 4 large warts still holding on. Where the clusters were are now huge open wounds. Has this happened to anyone else? It is so painful and I have a very high tolerance.  It is a large chemical burn and its right where my butt cheeks touch so there is no way to really keep it from rubbing.  Anyone have some advice? Love some direction here.  The pain is crucial and the skin looks like I was mauled by an animal.  I'm satisfied the warts are gone but I cannot be overjoyed about the way my vagina looks plus I'm getting married in 2 months.

21, 5, genital warts,Burning and bleeding.,Females listen up!! Second week on medication. You absolutely need someone to apply it to areas you can not reach_ or areas that need to be held open to DRY! If you have them on your rectum...You will need monostat_ clean wipes_ and panty liners. Hold area open and apply ONLY to warts. Keep area open to air dry at least a full minute or you get it on skin that doesn't need it.That skin will die!A fan helps a lot! They do start to come off after the first week_ usually when you wipe and it does hurt. You can get skin tears. If you do and it is on your rectal area_ you must keep it clean and dry or you will get a yeast infection there. The areas weep and cause wetness. A yeast infection has a noticeable odor and the area turns white. Here is what I did. Cleaned area three times a day and applied monostat. The areas were bleeding and weeping so I used a panty liner. Peel off the back and fold it in half . Put it in between the buttocks to keep the area dry at all times. You may need to change it a few times a day till the area heals enough to stop doing it. Yes it is uncomfortable. BUT please listen to me and this will get you through it. I am on my second week. All 7 of my vaginal warts fell off the first week. 5 of my rectal warts fell off as well. You can do this!!! Remember that once they are gone you still have the virus and you can get more warts...and spread it to your partner. The quickest way to know if the virus is gone is a pap smear.

It kept growing and I noticed small clusters of bumps under the folds of my vaginal lips. I was freaking out! I went to the doctor and as soon as she saw them she knew it was gw/aw. Right away she prescribed condylox. I read the application instructions but and applied it just to my warts but didn't let it dry. HUGE MISTAKE. It burned like no other and after a day my skin became white and tender to the touch. I only applied it 2xs a day for 3 days and after the 3rd day the warts under my vaginal lips were where white. I used a warm wash cloth and gently wiped them down an the warts fell off!!!! By the seconds days rest I started to notice the warts around my anus slowly go away and the large ""growth"" cluster of warts was virtually gone! I'm on my last rest day and ALL MY WARTS ARE GONE!! No scars marks or any proof they were even there. I have been so depressed because of this and felt my sexual life was over but condylox changed that.

27, 5, Genital warts,Slight irritation around site of wart. For very small warts_ this is very common since it is almost impossible to apply and not get any on healthy skin.,This is basically for the guys out there who have penile warts. I have used it on 4 separate occasions and each time it works like a breeze. You barely have to use any - just enough to get a thin coating on the wart. After 3 days you may notice a difference or you may not notice much of anything and think it is not working. Stick with the instructions and take the 4 days off. Each time I used it_ I noticed nothing until the 4th and 5th days_ when the skin/wart began flaking away and basically falling off. I've never needed to use more than one treatment week on a wart. 3 days_ morning and night (and you can be pretty relaxed on the time) and you'll likely be all through with it. Don't stress if you get a tiny bit on healthy skin. It does take a bit to dry. I give it at least 15 minutes just to be sure. **Feel free to email me of you have any questions.**,M,40,5  days1 2X D,5/14/2013Email,Condylox
28, 5, Genital Warts (gw),For the people that said burning burning burning... that is 100% correct. The first application burned_ but not as bad as later applications. The second application burned as well. I think it's better to bathe or shower first_ dry first_ and then apply the gel. Allow the gel to fully dry!  Do not close your legs or walk! The best is to sit with your back on the wall_ lay on the floor_ or lay on the bed and apply with mirror. I fanned it with a paper_ but some people use the cool setting on a hair dryer. If you are active with sports_ jobs_ etc.  You should do what I did and start on Thursday of Friday_ & do your 3 days wen you can relax. The second day of treatment for me was yesterday_ the pain was unbearable_ walking_ shitting (moves those muscles where the warts were). Also_ pee contains uric acid_ it burns the treated area very badly_ enough to make you shout!  It was so painful_ I decided to take a hot bath_ and soak_ I lightly scrubbed the area_  and ran warm/hot water on it.,I had felt a tiny little bumpy cluster at the bottom of my vaginal opening_ like right at the bottom. I have vaginal tears there after sex_ so I just thought the skin healed weird_ but I am a biology student_ so I knew it could also be gw. I went to the doctor_ she looked and immediately said it was gw. I cried_ I was devistated. She asked me if I wanted to treat and I said yes_ so she prescribed the gel. You are supposed to do twice a day_ once at morning_ and once at night. You can also use it while on your period. I took a shower_ and took my first dose at night. It took 3 seconds_ and then all of a sudden hurt immediately! Like imagine when you take a shot of tequila_ and the shock sensation afterward!! You want to use a good light (desk lamp maybe) and a small mirror_ magnifying is even better. I didn't use the precision tip_ I put the gel on qtips_ and applied with those.

30, 5, Genital Warts,When I first went to the doctor_ I was scared. I wanted these warts gone. I was prescribed Condylox per his request. I doused my penis in the gel and to my horror_ it burned while at work and burned for quite a while_ removing the majority of my genital warts but also the majority of my skin on my penis-head where the genital warts were. I could not handle this. So I stopped taking condylox_ this was a year ago almost precisely to the date. I then tried every other remedy I read about online_ although I was still smoking cigarettes. I stopped trying about 3 months later. Last week_ I went to the doctor again to try condylox_ since the warts had persisted. At this time_ I had quit cigarettes for about 2 weeks. I knew how to use the gel now and the results are amazing. Less is more_ guys! I have about 50+ warts_ flat and raised_ and they are dissapearing fast. The gel is basically an acid that eats away the warts and your skin. Be very_ very careful and as I said_ less is more. I still h,My best advice is to have a healthy diet_ raise your immune system_ quit cigarettes and alcohol and DO NOT PANIC. Use a nail file in order to allow the gel to enter the warts.

Tried to keep it off normal skin but difficult w location. I LITERALLY burned the first two layers of skin off a large area and have been couch/bed ridden for three days waiting to heal. Can't walk_ sit_ drive_ etc. if this happens to u don't panic. Get A and D ointment and Bactine cleansing spray w lidocaine (no sting kind). Take warm soapy bath three times a day to keep clean_ use Bactine 3x per day and A and D as often as u want. Bear down and pray.

35, 4, HPV,Very minor soreness_ no pain whatsoever.,I've been struggling with this condition for a few years now.  I've had multiple visits to the dermatologist for freezing (which has had limited results)_ and was prescribed Aldara which did absolutely nothing for me.  Condylox has so far been the most successful treatment.  I'm on week 3 now and my smaller warts have shrunk in half.  I have a cluster about the size of a penny on my waist line (which had previously been misdiagnosed by my doctor)_ and it's receding each week.  I don't feel I'll be completely rid of them by the end of 4 weeks so I may have to switch back to regular cryo/freezing visits to finish them off.  I've seen others' experiences stating that they were in a lot of pain but the treatment seemed to work very quickly for them.  I have absolutely no pain but my progress seems to be slower.  Maybe there's a correlation there.  Ultimately this treatment works for me but as I've learned_ the preferred treatment varies from person to person_ so don't be discouraged if your mileage varies.,M,33,3  weeks 2X D,10/17/2012,Condylox

I am laying in bed as I type this cringing from the burning_ stinging pain around my rectum. The whole area is red and raw and wiping after a bowel movement makes me want to cry. And passing gas. Never thought THAT could hurt. Anyways_ Because of the position of the warts around my anus_ its difficult to see well enough to apply only to the warts_ so a few times I have just taken a small amount and smeared it over the entire affected area. The only improvement I see so far is that some of the warts are getting a black spot so I hope that means they are necrotizing.

Skin is red_ but bumps are white and soft like they were left in the bathtub too long.It does seem to be working,This stuff works very well_ just be ULTRA CAREFUL to only apply to the wart or bump.Make sure you let it dry for a while before putting clothing on or doing anything that could spread this stuff around.,M,27,3  days 2X D,7/23/2012,Condylox
38, 4, Genital warts,Mostly burns once it is rinsed off after 4 hours. Wasn't to bad til my skin blistered. But well worth the pain!,I had done 5 treatments at the doctor and the warts were slowly going away. We decided to try condylox and I'm shocked. After the first cycle (3 days on_ 4 days off) my warts that I thought were impossible to get rid of are gone. Though I had gotten a huge blister around the cluster which is now almost gone as well. I'm on cycle number 2_ only see one small wart so I'm treating it.,F,22,  2X D,7/7/2012Email,Condylox
39, 2, Genital warts,Had no side effects if applied correctly,Forget Condylox.  I tried it several times and my warts never fully went away and they always returned quickly.  I went to a dermatologist. First he froze the warts then applied a substance similar to Condylox which I was told to wash off in 6 hours.  After 3 treatments 2 weeks apart my warts were gone completely and never returned.,M,63,30  days 2X D,6/12/2012,Condylox

48, 3, HPV Anal Warts,3 on_ 4off_ 3 on was the schedule for a max of 4 weeks. Have warts and hemorrhoids. I had my husband put the medicine on ONLY the warts very carefully. I missed 2 doses so I extended treatment to 4th day. On my first day of being off (5th day) I'm experiencing the worst pain. Some of the condylox got on good skin when my cheeks pressed together and ate surface away! Ouch! Haven't been able to have BM's very easily due to pain. Can't wait to see Dr in 2 days for check-up! Its VERY painful and hard to clean.The majority of the warts are gone_ but Im not sure its worth the pain.By the way_ is this the least painful at-home treatment?!,,M,22,4  days.5%,2/4/2012Email,Condylox
49, 4, Genital Wart,No side effects!,My wart completely fell off within the first application cycle!  I began using Condylox on Friday morning and I applied the medicine as directed ? twice a day_ three times a day.  I woke up Wednesday morning and I noticed the skin around the wart tore.  I left it as is and that same evening_ around 7 p.m. used the bathroom and noticed the wart was complete gone.  What a relief!  Now I have to focus on getting rid of the HPV_ if I still have it.Despite the side effects of the medicine_ I didn?t feel a thing.  I did notice the skin get darker and darker as Wednesday approached.  It?s like watching paint dry.  Nevertheless_ no itching_ burning_ headaches_ none of that stuff.  Some people may experience side effects_ others don?t.  If you don?t feel anything going on down there_ that doesn?t mean the medicine is not working.  Best wishes to all of you.,M,26,3  days 2X D,1/4/2012Email,Condylox
50, 4, HPV- GENITAL WARTS,I have a large patch in my rectal area_ that I just found out about. I'm on day two of treatment_ mine is a large cluster of small warts so very hard to apply just to the affected area. The first time I applied I stood up quickly and it burned so bad I almost fell over_ but after reading these reviews I used some of the tips. Ladies (or men) the hair dryer really helps. I haven't seen any improvements with the warts yet_ but the pain has started going away somewhat. But I've also read the pain doesn't really start until the first rest day. So we will see. i can say reading these has helped me feel a lot better about the situation.,,F,22,2  days,1/3/2012,Condylox

54, 4, HPV,burning/itching,"If you are not a male with a high pain tolerance I do not recommend this method of ""treatment"". After applying condylox for the last day i experienced scabs and pain. For the whole duration of application I applied the gel all over the base of my penis where the legions existed. The first and second day I experienced Immense pain. I headed to wallgreens and stocked up my operation cabinet and mentally prepared for immense pain (no painkillers whatsoever). I had picked the remaining scabs off the second day off the gel. I then poured rubbing alcohol (70%) all over the raw skin. CAUTION: THIS WILL BURN AND YOU WILL USE EXPLITIVES. the rubbing alcohol is to prevent any infection. I also used surgical gloves when dealing with the genitalia. It's not worth spreading the infection and doctors wear them when examining you for the disease so why not. After the rubbing alcohol i sprayed on neosporin with pain relief. After letting the neosporin dry somewhat I caked on vaseline. This keeps the neosporin in tact with the skin. Next i wrapped my whole penis in gaws (not the tip of the penis). So far this has made everyday movement possible. ONLY APPLY THE CONDYLOX GEL TO YOUR WARTS PRECISELY!!!! CONDYLOX IS AN ACID! The goal of condylox is to rott of the wart so if it comes in tact with healthy skin it will rott it away. Alcohol will be painful but it will keep your tender areas protected from infection. By the way i was wearing a condom. Email me for more or just to talk.",M,18,3  days.5 2X D,10/5/2011Email,Condylox
55, 3, Genital Warts,Swelling_ burning (especially when wiping)_ slight bleeding,I had about 6-7 one lg one one medium and the rest small...  I do not understand how ppl keep saying to not get this gel on healthy skin...  with extremely small warts it is impossible not to!  However the results seem to be worth the pain.  None are gone_ I wish they were but the ones that can be felt are noticably smaller.  How are women seeing them?  I don't understand lol I wish I can see down there to see what the heck is going on ne us girls are going in blind which also leads to this medicine going on to healthy areas of skin :/ ..  One thing I can suggest is not to use too much and dry with a hair dryer before and after application.  This is my third day on my first cycle so hopefully I see more results soon,F,24,3  days.5% 2X D,9/18/2011,Condylox
56, 4, Genital Warts,Pain_Swelling_ Ordor,This shit burns like crazy but if you want to get better you will suck it up and just deal with it. The 1st day applying the gel it was not that bad. But then the 2nd and 3rd day OMG burning and a nasty smell_ its hard to walk_ get out of bed_ sit_ wip anything. So I'm on my first day of rest and I'm sprying Neosporin with pain all over and apply warm rags it makes it feel so much better. But I'm going to the doc Saturday just to get a week check up because the smell is REALLY bad. Make sure you put the gel on the warts only and have a fan to blow on it to help it dry_ make sure you let it air out. It is very nasty but its working =) ready for it to be over 1st and last STD,F,21,4  weeks 2X D,8/18/2011,Condylox
57, 4, gw,"I was just reading the instructions again_ now i understand what they meant by ""erosion"". this stuff BURNS whatever you put it on. hence any bleeding (fold of skin touching the applied areas)_ and the redness_ and the swelling_ and the painful days of work walking around. Only using it for 3 days and noticeable discoloration of warts to slight black.",3 days in and its going good. Ive had em for about 3 yrs_ thought they'd go away on their own. Fed up_ I turned to the real deal. I have about 30 warts on the shaft and base of my penis ranging from tiny to pea sized. After 3 days its getting slimy on some warts_ and some turn black and start to shed... Good advice about the neosporin Ill try it.... overall if you need it_ use it carefully and let it dry! Hopefully they all leave for good but honestly I dont think they ever really will... But who knows_ maybe ill eat those words.,M,25,3  days7mg 2X D,6/18/2011,Condylox
58, 5, genital warts,Severe burning_ a bit uncomfortable,Just found out last Tuesday I have warts. Used the 3 days 2x a day and I'm on my second day of rest. I had 6 warts on my vagina and only one that was larger is left.  The pain isn't too bad_ but definitely worth it. Try aloe. It soothed the burn and heals the sores from the area where the wart was. Highly recommend it!!,F,22,3  days 2X D,5/14/2011,Condylox
59, 3, GW,a little redness_ didnt feel any burning that everyone else seems to have felt,i went through 2 of these bottles and the warts pretty much went away however i had more and more reappear after i stopped apply...i would start my cycles again and they would disappear_ again i stopped and more would appear_ guess it didnt work for me,M,24,3  months.5 2X D,5/9/2011,Condylox
