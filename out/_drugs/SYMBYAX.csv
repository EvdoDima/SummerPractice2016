0, 4, treatment-resistant depression,Tiredness_ weight gain_ low blood sugar episodes_ hunger,This was the first medication that ever worked for my depression. It gave me motivation to pursue my hobbies again. The sleepiness was intense at first and I could NOT wake up unless I slept at least 8 to 10 hours_ but that did go away after a couple weeks. I sleep really well on this medication. I actually quit taking it because I didn't like the low blood sugar episodes and risk of diabetes - which I'm at risk for already - or the insatiable hunger and weight gain. I tried Abilify and it was actually much worse. So I'm back on the Symbyax. I don't know if I'm going to develop diabetes or how long I'll be able to stay on this_ but it really is the only thing that works.,F,37,5  weeks6mg/25mg 1X D,2/18/2011Email,Symbyax
1, 3, Depression & Anxiety,Weight gain_ increased appetite.,Other than the increased appetite and weight gain I loved this medication. It gave me energy to do things I haven't done for a long time. Like hiking_ riding my bike_ exercising etc. It made me happy and wanted to be around people again. I hated to stop taking it_ but I had to because of the 30 pd weight gain which caused my blood pressure to go up. I wish so much I could have stayed on it.,F,50,2  months3mg/25mg 1X D,2/7/2011,Symbyax
2, 1, Depression_ social anxiety,Developed a rash_ slept for almost two days straight. Medication made me extremely tired.,,M,20,3  days3/25 1X D,12/18/2010Email,Symbyax
3, 3, GAD_ depression,shaky feeling in arm and leg muscles_ slightly lightheaded_ heart feels like it's beating harder (not faster_ but harder),Helps my insomnia greatly!  Anxiety is somewhat better after 3 days.  I'm worried about the possiblity of facial tremors_ which my doc said could show up in 20 years from now and supposedly increases with the amount of time one is on the drug...,F,37,4  days3/25 1X D,9/27/2010,Symbyax
4, 4, Add on to Pristiq 50 mg,sleepy_ blurred vision_ foggy headed_ insatiable hunger_ weight gain...,while the side effects arent fun to deal with (esp the weight gain) I slept very sound for the first time in years.  At first I had a hard time getting up and going in the am but now I am up at at'em!  I do feel I have a ton more energy and dont NEED a 2 hr midday nap anymore.  I do have to take it at nite but it does make me sleepy initially.  The depression and anxiety are completely GONE!! Overall I think it works well but I am concerned about the side effects of weight gain and high cholesterol...switching to Abilify next week....,F,34,11  days3/25 1X D,7/17/2010Email,Symbyax
