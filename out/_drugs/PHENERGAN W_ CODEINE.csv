0, 4, Torn ligaments and cartilage,I have been taking Codeine Phosphate Hemihydrate Paracetamol capsules for about a year.I take them as and when I need them this can range from 1 a day to 1 a month depending how my legs are.I suffered no side effects with these only extreme drowsiness at first.I have however built up a tolerance to them now and a full dose 60/1000mg now gives me no side effects but sometimes isn't strong enough to fight my painI would recommend these but do be careful as they are extremely addictive!!!,,F,19,1  years30/500 mg,10/9/2012,Phenergan w/ codeine
1, 5, Pneumonia / chronic cough,No side effects at all_ besides relief! I can finally get sleep! Nothing else works as well as this cough syrup for me_ I've tried everything!!! I have a rare lung disease so I've tried almost everything_ and promethazine w/codeine is by far the best to stop or ease up my coughing spells. Slight drowsiness may be a side effect_ but I am unsure whether it is from the syrup_ or the relief provided from it. I highly recomend this medication if you have a severe cough:),,F,26,7  days1teaspoon,3/5/2012,Phenergan w/ codeine
2, 5, easing Bronchitis cough,Almost immediate feeling like I was drunk.,Past experience with a post-op med containing codeine let me know that this stuff was going to knock me on my rear figuratively speaking. It has definitely done its job both with cutting down coughing and putting me to sleep at night. It is not the primary medication I am on for bronchitis but still helps immensely.,F,29,10  days 1X D,10/15/2010Email,Phenergan w/ codeine
3, 5, Asthmatic cough after cold,A bit groggy and thirsty in the AM_ but not a problem.,This cough suppressant is superior to Tussonex in that you actually get a good night's rest_ with REM sleep.  It works as advertised for cough suppression.  Thanks_ doctor.,M,48,3  days 1X D,8/31/2010,Phenergan w/ codeine
4, 2, Back pain,extreme neausea,It helped the paid but made me feel so sick I couldn't take it again,F,56,1  days,1/20/2010,Phenergan w/ codeine
5, 1, pain,nasuea everything bad,30% of people cant metabolize codine into a narcotic. if your doctor prescribes it tell them to fuck off,M,15,2  weeks,4/15/2009,Phenergan w/ codeine
6, 2, coughing,With 1 tsp_ NOTHING happened.  No effect on cough - didn't even feel drowsy.  With 2 tsps_ very slight effect on cough and slight dizziness and fatigue.,,F,31,2  days,1/6/2009,Phenergan w/ codeine
7, 3, Chronic Bronchitis,My head feels heavy_ migrane headache and just feel uncomfortable.,I'm taking Phenergan w/Codeine to wean off from Tussionex Penniketic. I've been taking Tussionex every day since April of this year. So my body has gotten used to the medicine. I just would like to note; I wasn't taking it to feel any high.All it ever did for me was control the cough and put me to sleep. I was simply taken it for my Bronchitis. Now I just hope I could finally rid myself of this medication as well and go back to normality.,F,39,1  days,11/4/2008Email,Phenergan w/ codeine

9, 1, cold/cough,Uncontrolled vomiting (including dry-heaving)_  horrendous headache_ leg weakness. Lasted for 12 hours. Took 1/2 tsp of the 'mild' cough medicine. Full recovery took 24 hours.,I'd taken it before_ years ago_ with tylenol_ and got nauseated_ but never vomited.  Never again.,F,60,1  times,10/14/2007,Phenergan w/ codeine
10, 1, dysmenorrhea,I took this in the form of Tylenol #3 and as plain Codeine.  Had nausea_ sweats_ violent itching_ allergic reaction.  All in all_ a horrible experience.,It says it is an analgesic_ but I guess it is meant to be cough medicine_ as it has no effect on pain.   I assume I am allergic_ as it caused my hands to swell.  Itching was unbelievable - absolute torture.  PLEASE don't let your doctor Rx this for any kind of pain !,F,28,1  weeks,10/24/2006,Phenergan w/ codeine
11, 5, cough from bronchitis,none,It really provides cough suppression and has a pleasant taste_ unlike another cough medicine I was given.,F,52,3  days,9/22/2006Email,Phenergan w/ codeine
12, 5, chronic cough/pneumonia,recently blurred vision - only in morning_ minor constipation,This is the only remedy that has worked effectively and reliably for over 35 years. Have asthma and any chest cold becomes a racking cough - as a youth lasting over 4 weeks. As an adult it remains the only effective treatment for night time rest and quickest relief for cough. Generic made me gag_ only the original has worked. Also effective are Teslan pearls for cough suppression - chem name benzonatate - phenomenal when combined with phenergan - nothing beats it!  Have never had problems with it being additive either.,F,41,14  days,7/7/2006,Phenergan w/ codeine
13, 5, Coughing all night,None,This is the only cough medicine that helps me to get a good night's sleep when I am coughing all night. Not only does it stop all coughing_ but it also seems to help me fall asleep and stay asleep. It works every time. Wish I could take it more often. My doctor will only prescribe it if I'm desperate.,F,62,3  days,4/16/2006Email,Phenergan w/ codeine
14, 5, bad cough,some drowziness in the morning,while recovering from pneumonia with a bad cough_ this medication instantly stopped my cough and gave me the relief I so desperately needed for sleep and rest,M,54,4  days,1/11/2006Email,Phenergan w/ codeine
15, 5, terrible cough,none,This is the ONLY medicine that stops my cough. Why can't it be bought OTC?,F,42,4  days,12/28/2005,Phenergan w/ codeine
16, 5, bronchitis,None really_ the first day I was a little sleepy but not enough to stop me from my daily activities or effect my thinking.,It worked wonders! I was previously on Carbofed which is generic for Rondec DM and that did nothing_ that had dextro and an antihistamine in it and that made me extremely tired with no relief at all. I would recommend this to anyone.,F,21,6  days,12/11/2005,Phenergan w/ codeine
17, 5, Cough,Extremely effective and very low nausea side effects!,You do feel interesting while taking and after taking for about a week I REALLY craved donuts after I stopped taking the drug.  It's great and cheap!,M,49,7  days,5/26/2005,Phenergan w/ codeine
18, 5, Chronic cough,Some dizziness_ enough to keep me off of ladders.  Very managable.,The only thing that really stops my cough.  Dextromethorphan won't touch it.  Taking the codeine for about a week stops the cough until the next cold_ usually months later.,M,48,7  days,1/25/2005,Phenergan w/ codeine
19, 5, cough,none...a little sleepy,this is the only cough medicine that doesn't make me want to vomit from the taste...it is an old medication_ but it tastes better than anything out there...it is hard to get_ though as the insurance companies want you to have the generic which tastes awful...if you have to take a medicine_ it should at least taste ok,F,39,6  days,10/10/2004,Phenergan w/ codeine
20, 5, strep pneumonia - wheezing cough,None whatsoever!,Amazing relief!  Horrible cough that went into wheezing.  Talking to anyone would stimulate coughing/wheezing attacks.  Previously on just codeine elixir with minor relief.  P & C saved me!!!  As the days progressed_ need for use decreased.,F,45,7  days,8/25/2004,Phenergan w/ codeine
21, 2, post-op pain,extreme nausea!  REALLY extreme!   Did I mention EXTREME?,loopy sleep_ couldn't wake up_ felt trapped in sleep/dream.half-awake cycle--felt totally helpless and frightened,F,16,4  days,4/5/2002,Phenergan w/ codeine
