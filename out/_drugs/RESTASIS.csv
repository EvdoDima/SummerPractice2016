0, 1, Extreme dry eye,After one dose in each eye_ within the hour_ I started feeling jittery_ had pressure on my chest and had difficulty breathing.  I thought it was a coincidence but started reading comments on this site and knew for sure it was from Restasis. My eyes are really bad and don't know where to go from here. Can anyone recommend what alternative to take to help this painful condition?,,F,69,1  days0.05,8/15/2016Email,Restasis

2, 1, Dry eye and to help other eye issue,I was experiencing head aches.  I normally do not have that problem.  Additionally I felt a need to clear my throat more often and would sometimes loose my voice.  As soon as I realized it might be from the meds I found this web site.  I discontinued Restasis and by the next day I felt great and the symptoms were gone!  It did help the dry eyes_ but not worth the side effects!,This seems a dangerous medication.  It's very expensive.  What do I do with the 2 1/2 month supply I have left?  I wouldn't even want to donate it.  Market value close to $700!  Fortunately my pharmacy helped me find a coupon and I have insurance so cost was $10.,F,60,2  weeks,7/2/2016,Restasis

56, 2, Dry eyes,OMG- Restasis gave me pink eye at the worst time!!  Now i can't go to work.  Spent 4 hours in the ER.  I'm wondering why my doctor suggested I try this???  Side effects are worse than the dry eyes.,Don't use this!!,F,46,1  months30,3/30/2015,Restasis
57, 2, Dry Eyes,Took Restasis for two years & often had red eyes but didn't  make the connection until today. Husband kept saying stop but ignored him. Today cannot stop the tears and runny nose. Am miserable. Have washed eyes repeatedly in cold water and left eye is better but right eye won't give the tears a rest. Am stopping restasis and hope my eyes will recuperate without having to see a doctor. Recommend no one stay on Restasis for an extended time.,DO NOT TAKE FOR EXTENDED TIME PERIOD.,F,72,4  monthsYes,3/28/2015,Restasis
58, 3, Chronic Dry Eye,Since taking Restasis I have had excess mucous and post nasal drip every night_ resulting in a sore throat every morning. Symptoms started within the first month of use and has progressively worsened. I finally made the connection when I realized that on the few occasions when I forgot my evening dose and had a decent night sleep. My eyes feel better but can no longer deal with side effect!,I am stopping Restasis and hope that an equally effective replacement without all the side effects can be developed.,F,62,7  months0.05mg 2X D,3/20/2015,Restasis
59, 3, Severe dry eyes,I experience post nasal drip every single night which results in waking with a sore throat. I never had it before using Restasis and know that the drug is the cause_ because on the 4 occasions that I forgot the evening dose I did not have the post nasal drip all night and NO sore throat in the morning! Not sure what the answer will be for an alternative but 7 months of this is too long!,It's very sad that something that appears to help has so many different side effects_ let's hope they come up with a better alternative because it appears many people like myself suffer from Dry Eye!,F,62,7  months0.05% 2X D,3/19/2015,Restasis
