0, 3, Hypertension,Initially no side effects. In week 4 now and started having diahrrea soon after I take a dose. I'm only on 25mgs a day. I always request lowest dose possible. Hoping it passes. The other med made me cough nonstop (ALTACE) so switched to this,I have sudden onset of high blood pressure. Was running 180/110. Came out of nowhere.  After 4 weeks I'm in the 140/90 range so it's starting to work. Hoping the bad case of the diahhrea ends. I take at night now. Can't take it in the morning or day hours or I can't leave the house. Always in the bathroom. Been using small dose of Imodium to help offset,F,40,1  months25mgs,6/3/2016,Toprol-xl

I have went with reducing dosage by a quarter every two weeks. Do not try and quit cold turkey or you could end up in ER like I did with racing heart and feeling like I was going to have another heart attack. For me this is one of the worst drugs I have ever experienced. Never felt so awful and the cardiologist had the nerve to say it was all in my head. Dismissed the side effects and said maybe I needed an antidepressant. Needed an antidepressant for being on the damn Metoprolol. God awful drug. How they don't see a pattern with people's side effects is beyond me. Stay away from this stuff if you want to be happy. That is my two cents. Hope you all can recognize your side effects. Is slow but eventually you will be in a fog and not even realize it. Be careful with this drug in higher dosages.,M,46,2  years50mg a day,10/2/2015,Toprol-xl

11, 1, Mitral valve regurgitation,Brain fog_ light-headed_ dizziness_ extreme exhaustion_ no energy_ neuropathy_ hair loss,I was diagnosed with mitral valve regurgitation at age 38 after going to my doctor complaining of increased fatigue and light headedness.  Within 8 months of diagnosis_ I had open-heart surgery to repair the valve.  My cardiologist put me on this drug (generic version) so that my heart would not have to work as hard. It did reduce my pulse rate and blood pressure_ but my blood pressure is already rather low. The surgery fixed my heart_ but this medicine caused some of the same symptoms that I had before the surgery. I felt almost constantly tired and fatigued. Sometimes around bedtime_ I often felt that if I did not lie down and sleep immediately that I was going to die.  Periodically_ I would get dizzy and light headed.  I had brain fog and could not mentally focus. In addition_ I began to experience new issues.  My hair began to fall out_ I gained about 10 pounds_  and I had localized nerve pain/sensitivity in one area from about the 12th through 24th month of being on the drug (one full year of this neuropathy). My cardiologist said that metoprolol was not known to cause this_ but after carefully weaning myself off of it by gradually reducing the dosage_ the nerve pain went away after a few weeks and has not returned.  I feel like my old self again now that I am off of metoprolol. The fatigue_ brain fog_ light headedness_ dizzy spells_ and nerve pain are all gone. I am back to my normal weight. I hope my lost hair comes back_ but I'm doubtful.,M,42,2  years25 mg,5/23/2015,Toprol-xl

Huge and dangerous mood swings.,This drug has turned my life upside down. I am a vegetarian_ strength and endurance athlete_ do yoga almost daily and am a relentlessly hard worker. I lost both parents within the last 1.5 years. The losses and ensuing family issues started triggering panic attacks. My doctor put me on Zoloft first_ it helped a bit with the depression but did not stop the panic attacks. He then put me on 50mg of T a day. The panic attacks started getting worse_ so he upped the T to 100mg a day. My life continued to plummet into a dark abyss. Hateful_ obsessive thoughts_ constantly toying with killing myself.. I have all but stopped working out_ which is something I've never had trouble motivating to do. I just don't have the energy anymore and if I do manage to get in a workout_ I'm gasping for breath the whole time_ dry coughing and nauseous. Let's not even get into the joint pain afterwards. I can barely mow the lawn now. I feel like I could write a novel about how horrible of an experience Toprol has been and still is. Until yesterday when I found these message boards_ I thought I was going insane_ literally. Last night was my first skipped dose_ I'm going cold turkey because I refuse to put any more of this poison in my body. I'd rather control my thoughts and breathing than feel so horrible. I blame Toprol because I've almost never had most of these issues before taking it.

Symptoms are fairly intense the first month or so. Fatigue mainly_ some anxiety. My symptoms subsided after a few months. I am a runner_ completing several 10k and half marathons in the past year. Exercise is a bit different while on Toprol XL. My heart rate increases very slowly and will not peak above 130 BPM. Sort of like limiting fuel to an engine.

One side effect that has been great is my cardio endurance during workouts has improved drastically. With the heart rate kept down I don't fatigue as easily and can swim greater distances than I have in 15 years. Nice to workout and not tire so easily as was the problem prior to taking the medication.

When on once daily dosing at 25mg I was getting very strong rebound arrhythmia's. When the 2nd a.m. dose of 12.5mg was added_ all heart irregularities ceased. So far it's been working for a little over one month. In my case_ we were hoping it would lower my heart rate and RAISE my blood pressure to stop frequent fainting. Toprol didn't help to raise my BP so I had to add another med. The nightmares and nighttime air hunger were short-lived. I do not get increased exhaustion on the med_ but I'm still unable to run long distance or exercise like I used to before my heart symptoms began.,F,27,5  weeks25 & 12.5 2X D,11/22/2013,Toprol-xl

A-fib stopped when I took 25mg Xanax that I happened to have with me - my heart doctor was quite surprised_ as Xanax is not the normal prescription for A-fib...thereafter I took 12.5mg Metoprolol XL once at night_ that I reduced to 10mg.

The symptoms have been getting a little worse as of late so i decided to do some research online regarding the drug and came across this website and a slew of data showing the ill effects of this drug. I plan on visiting with my new GP next week and start getting off this drug. It does help mediate some things but when you help solve one problem and create a few dozen more_ its not worth it. If you are having some or all of the side effects listed from all the people here_ talk to your doc about possibly getting off.

56, 1, High Blood Pressure,I am taking a Generic Toprol XL.  First I was taking 100 mg twice a day when a doc told me to stop it.  Ended up in the hospital with palpitations_ speeding heart rate_ very high blood pressure and anxiety.  Doc says_ oh I wouldn't have told you to stop it if I knew you had a heart problem.  Hmm_ well_ I don't have a heart problem_ I told him it's the drug.  Had to look it up on the internet to find out what was wrong with me and had to go back on it to stop the withdrawal symptoms.  I am now on 100 mg. 1 time a day.  Not one doc will get me off this drug.  I have been to three asking for help.  Right after I started taking it I got dizzy all the time and was sent to a neurologist who said I was having migraines without the pain_ quack.  He put me on another drug.  Watch out docs will put on more drugs because of the side effects of the BP med. Then it just gets worse.  You can't convince them that it's the drug that's causing all your symptoms. I am dizzy all the time_ foggy_ insomnia,,F,51,4  years100 mg 1X D,5/30/2011EmailHistory,Toprol-xl

59, 1, High Blood Pressure/Heart Disease,I recently had 3 stents put in 12/2010.  I had been on Toprol in varying amounts for 10 years.  My BP was perfect or low and my heart rate was about 50 bpm.  I have always had a lower than normal heart rate.  Although I have had heart stents before_ I was not feeling well after this procedure.  Real dizzy especially in the afternoon.  About 3 weeks after the surgery_ I went to the emergency room and my heart rate was 41 and BP was 90/45.  The Dr. weined me off Toprol (25MG)over about a 2 week period.  First cut back to 12.5 MG for a week then half of that for about a week.  Dizziness is still present_ not as persistent as before.  Heart rate is close to 60 and BP is either at or below normal (120/80) most of the time.  Not sure what changed with the stents_ but BP seems to have stablized. Still taking Altace however.,,M,65,10  years50-25 MG 1X D,3/14/2011,Toprol-xl
