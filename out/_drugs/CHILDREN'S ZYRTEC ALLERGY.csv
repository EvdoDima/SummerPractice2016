0, 1, ,Our 7 year old daughter took it for allergy symptoms for 6 weeks and her behavior really changed. She became combative_ and had a cold look in her eyes. Something was happening and it was scaring us. AND THEN SHE HAD VIOLENT INVOLUNTARY NECK AND HEAD JERKING! At first we thought it was a habit she picked up from other kids at school_ looked like an exaggerated movement you would make when surprised....head thrown back_ shoulders crunched up_ but one day it got to be every few minutes....we found this website_and immediately stopped using Zyrtec. The active ingredient has all these side effects that ARE NOT LISTED on the bottle OR the the Zyrtec website!!!It took 5 weeks for the twitches to finally completely go away. And her personality came back almost immediately. And now we find out the the FDA has recalled all the products made by MacNeil_ incl Zyrtec_ Children's Tylenol_ etc....We are disgusted by this whole situation_ not realizing we were poisoning our daughter!,,F,7,6  weeks10mg 1X D,5/9/2010Email,Children's zyrtec allergy
