0, 4, Low T,anyone who says that this stuff smells terrible is crazy. I cant tell you how many women have complimented me let alone want to jump me due to the smell of Testim alone!!! So many women have asked me what that smell is that its incredible. Testim please do not change the smell!,Good stuff.,M,41,1  days50 1X D,8/21/2014,Testim
1, 5, low T,none,had no response to androgen regardless of dose.   had  a quick response to Testim.   Eventually found I needed to be on two vials.  really helpful.   It has a slight scent but oddly_ many women think I'm wearing some kind of obscure cologne.  Dont like the sticky feel while its drying but that small drawback is worth it for me.,M,51,3  years100 mg 1X D,10/8/2013,Testim
2, 1, hypogonadism,none,This stuff works well and smells horrible.  The smell does not wash off_ and nobody will f*ck you smelling this bad.  Spend the extra $ and get the patch.,M,50,3  weeks50 mg 1X D,7/1/2013,Testim
3, 2, low testosterone,None yet,Odor is very strong. Gets in clothes_ sheets_ pillows. Does not wash out in laundry. Smells like old ladies smelled in church back in the 1950s_ icky sweet with sweat and cheap talcum powder beneath it. I may not be able to tolerate this drug. I used Androgen before. No smell. I had to switch as A-gel went off the formulary of my insurance plan_ but I would sure love to ditch the stench!,M,64,1  weeks30 mg 1X D,12/5/2012,Testim
4, 1, low t,High blood pressure_ high hemoglobin_ restless nights,,M,57,12  months150GM 1X D,12/5/2012Email,Testim
5, 4, Low T levels_ no sex drive.,I'm getting acne on my upper back and acne and whiteheads on my face_ specifically the chin and lips area. I'm always seeing whiteheads on the edges of my lips. What can be done?,,M,56,3  months50 MG,6/13/2012,Testim
6, 3, Low T,At first some heat flashes_ then those went away very quickly.  No side effects for one year_but this year more frequent heart palpitations and my blood pressure began to rise.  The smell wasn't bad either and the med stays on your skin real well.  Did not experience any rashes or allergy to this med..,This drug did help me raise my T levels last year_ but this year my levels have stayed low.  Below 230.  I don't know what my body is doing with the Testim_ but not raising my T levels.  I know it's not converting the testosterone to Estradiol because my E levels were normal.  Going to try the Clomid route.....,M,42,2  years50MG/tube 1X D,8/25/2010,Testim
7, 4, Low T,None except the musky smell. It's very sticky even after waiting few minutes to dry. My wife likes the smell_ unfortunately_ so do my other male coworkers.,Prescribed due to normal but low testosterone. I was at low 300s but my urologist wanted me to be above 500. I stopped using it after the birth of my daughter -- can't risk the chance of rubbing the med on her.,M,40,5  months1% 1X D,7/14/2010Email,Testim
8, 5, hypogonadism ( low T),After  several months on Testim I got some acne on my stomach and chest area.. not a big deal for what I get in the benefits of this drug.,Testim has made a big difference for me.. My libido has increased.. I feel more energetic and healthy and I am not fatigued any longer..I am happier and generally have a much better sense of well being. Yes_ it does have a smell..but not a bad one ..my wife really gets turned on by it _ actually. It is known to absorb better than androgel for many men and it works great for me.. it keeps my testosterone levels up where they need to be.,M,51,3  years10 grams 1X D,5/17/2010Email,Testim
9, 2, Hypogonadism,Actually wasn't on it long enough to experience side effects.  Posting because I wanted to let people know that this product smells.  Had to switch to Androgel as it is odorless.,This product smells.  It's not an offensive smell_ but it lingers_ even after showering_ and gets stronger if you work out.  My wife thought it smelled sweet; not a manly smell.  From what I could find online_ the smell comes from a chemical they add to help the product be absorbed more quickly.  Basically_ with Testim_ you can wash it off or go swimming 2 hours after application.  With Androgel_ they recommend waiting for 5-6 hours.,M,38,2  days1% 1X D,2/11/2010Email,Testim
