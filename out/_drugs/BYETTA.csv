Didn't do so well overnight and across morning. So_ Dr has stopped and resumed insulin therapy :(I guess it comes down to the individual's needs.

6, 4, Diabetic 2,A little constipation. Feeling full earlier than normal when eating.,Dropped insulin to start Byetta. Appears to have really stabilised BSLs - rarely above 10 and fasting about 8. Looking forward to 10 units when Endo gives green light. Hope to stay off insulin. Downside was going from 1 injection to 2 per day. No other real issues + no weight loss or gain. Positive experience so far.,M,49,8  days5 2X D,7/23/2013Email,Byetta
7, 2, Diabetes 2,It somewhat controls appetite however the pain in my legs is not worth the appetite control. I didn't realize it was from the byetta and I went to multiple docs trying to figure out the problem. Then my dad said maybe its that medicine ur on so I stopped it and the pain started to go away.

9, 4, diabetes type 2,Nausea for the first couple of months as we ramped up my dosage.  Not as bad as morning sickness from pregnancies.  It went away.  I have other symptoms_ but really_ I'm going through menopause and some family trauma.  I don't feel as though I can blame Byetta for my body that is struggling.,I noticed a big difference in how full I felt from the beginning.  It helped tremendously with my blood sugar.  Now my A1C is in the 5.4  range_ before about 6.2  I have dropped 20 lbs.  There are times it feels less effective_ so I go off of it for 3/4 days_ then start again.  I always notice a big difference a couple of days after I've gone off of it_ I want to eat everything in the house.,F,56,29  months10  mcg 2X D,5/15/2013,Byetta

No nausea even at the start.,In tandem with a couple of major changes to how I worked my diet which has given me much more control in splitting up calories per day and a much more varied diet_ Byetta has led to me losing 6 stone over 7 months after 30 years of failure.

12, 1, Type II Diabetes,My husband started taking Byetta and was in heaven because he lost 40 lbs that insulin put on him. He plateaud and went crazy trying to lose more weight. He eats all junk food and high fat _ high carb meals and then starves himself and eats Adkins Bars and shakes. He has lost all his friends_ he is acting abnormal_ has an obcession with weight loss. He is almost 49 and I am afraid he will kill himself on Byetta! He litterally has lost his mind! All he thinks about is weight loss_ shaving all the hair off his body and buying new clothes_ from 38_ to 36 to 34 inch waist and says he is going to keep losing weight. His hair is thinning on his head. he is out of control with spending money and running us into debt. I called his doctor and told the office nurse he was eating all junk food and playing a dangerous game with this drug and the dim wit told him he could lose 16 more pounds! He is killing himself and ruining our lives_ marriage and hurting our children.,It makes people lose their minds!!!,M,49,1.5  years 2X D,8/18/2012Email,Byetta

15, 4, high blood glucose #s,heartburn_ nausea_ weight gain at first,I was on 5mg 2x a day_ and it helped a bit_ but I gained weight_ contrary to what I've read. I also had daily heartburn and nausea and kept antacids closeby. A month ago i went to 10mg since blood sugar #s were going up and am having a much better experience. I've figured out that if I don't each much in quantity at a meal_ I have no heartburn/nausea and great #s.

16, 4, Diabetes II,Get lethargic if I eat too many carbs_ but now that I figured that out_ I have more energy than the last 6 months.  My stomach sometimes gets a little jumpy_ but none of the naseau which is the most typical side effect.  I have had several bouts of diarhea_ which can be linked directly to eating too many carbs/too high fat carbs for dinner.  Appetite has been interesting.  I go through long periods of not being hungry at all_ then instantly hungry.  Then a little bit of food_ and I am full again.  Blood sugars in a more controlled range (was averaging 200_ down to 150 in first week).  Have periods of intense warmth_ usually after eating.  Slight increase in rosacea_ but I had that prior to this drug already.  Well worth a shot twice a day for these kinds of results.

The smell and taste right when i take the injection bothers me.,It's hard to deal with at times_ and i resent the fact that im 18 and have to do this but it could be worse because It definitely beats Metformin. I can tell when i don't eat right. I'm definitely getting used to what it does to my body. It's nothing i can't live with. It's been the best medicine i've tried for my PCOS (and i've tried metformin_ glumetza_ and actos) even though i get sick 8 out of 10 times i take it_ over all im happy with it.,F,18,2  months10mcg 2X D,3/28/2011Email,Byetta

41, 5, PCOS,The number one side effect that I had instantly was feeling tired_ weak_sicl to my stomach and at times vomitting without warning.I did notice that my sense of smell went to the roof. I could smell things that noone else could. Almost like a pregnant woman.  When I first started Byetta in Feb of this year the first two to three weeks were horrible. I talked to my GYN and said to take tums and if needed take Zofran for my stomach. After the medicine got used to my body_ the side effects went away and was able to eat an hour prior to a meal_ without problems. If you go off your dose for a while_ you experience the side effects all over again. That's mainly why I took so long to get back in the groove of things.,Since February of 2010 I have lost 70lbs. I have PCOS and the Byetta helps a lot with my body making too much insulin. And since I have been taking Byetta I noticed I haven't had as much woman problems. The weight factor is awesome_ just another perk. But I love the way the medicine works with my PCOS. I love Byetta! (Once the side effects are gone by week 3),F,23, 10 mg 2X D,11/3/2010,Byetta

I already ate low carb before Byetta_ now I still do... but can be bad every now and then without falling asleep.Yes_ sometimes the shot stings a little_ or I hit a tender spot... but for all the good this is doing for me_ I can live with it.

About a month ago I went for a checkup and my A1C went from 7.1 to 5.9.  I also take 500mg of metformin 2 times a day along with the byetta.  I take my byetta an hour before I eat.
