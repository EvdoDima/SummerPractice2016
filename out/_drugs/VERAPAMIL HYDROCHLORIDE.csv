0, 4, hi blood pressure; svt's;pvc,constipation_ see comments,I am on the ER (extended release) of 180 mg and I take that with 80mg of quinapril. the verapamil has helped the quinapril lower my stubborn high blood pressure (160/115) to a range of 125/85. I do not have any really noticable s/e other than the constipation . I do have hair loss and some mental fog_but I think  hair loss and mental fog are due to the incrase of my quinapril ( I was at 40 a day and it wasnt working so I went to 80 mg) overall_ verapamil ER made by mylan is great as long as you dont mind taking a fiber supplement to help with the constipation. I think the benefits of taking the verapamil outweighs the one minor s/e.,F,36,45  days180 1X D,11/4/2010,Verapamil hydrochloride
