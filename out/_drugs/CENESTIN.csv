0, 5, Total hysterectomy at early age,None,I've taken Cenestin for 10yrs due to hysterectomy. I was dx with aggressive breast cancer in 2012_ but it was NOT fed by estrogen or progesterone. It was Her2+. I stopped taking Cenestin abruptly due to oncologist pressing the issue. This was a terrible mistake! It affected me cognitively and caused many physical discomforts. After 6 months I found a dr that would prescribe it again_ despite the breast cancer history. I feel so much better now! Quality of life definetly trumps quantity in my opinion. Drs need to be more compassionate about this issue.,F,42,10  years.45mg 1X D,12/1/2014Email,Cenestin
1, 5, Menopausal symptoms,,This is the only HRT that works for me. There have been times that it has not been available and I got a generic and my symptoms returned.,F,58,9  years.3 mg 1X D,7/18/2014Email,Cenestin
2, 1, hysterectomy,Started to notice itching in my arms and legs but Dr. said to keep taking that this medicine should not cause that and she had never heard of anyone else with that issue.  Now_ I have stopped taking it because I finally broke out in a rash on my shoulders. I would not recommend to anyone.,,F,49,7  months1.25 1X D,5/2/2013,Cenestin

5, 5, Total Hysterectomy with ovaries out,None while taking...love it.,I had a complete hyst in 1993 and had tried many other estrogen products while I was a clinical RN in a women's health clinic...kind of the office guinea pig.  They were not controlling the menopausal side effects_ such as hot flashes_ insomnia_ anxiety spells_ etc.  A dear friend_ another RN_ suggested Cenestin_ so I tried it and was amazed...after one month_ no menopausal symptoms and I was able to smile_ enjoy life with more energy as well as a happier temprament_ which my hubby was grateful for.  I have tried to wean down to a smaller dose_ but the hot flashes and grumpiness return full force_ so I am still on 1.25 mg.  At 55 years of age_ I will continue to use for another few years under my doctor's close care...unfortunately the cost has skyrocketed since I started to take them years ago and it may not be an option for others due to lack of funds or insurance!,F,55,10  years1.25 mg 1X D,2/23/2012Email,Cenestin
6, 5, oopherectomy,None,I have been on HRT for 21 years. I am a small boned person but have not had bone loss. I attribute this to Cenestin. I tried not taking Cenestin but the hot flashes drove me mad.  The headaches that I had had before taking HRT came back. I persevered for one month. That was enough. I will not give up Cenestin.,F,72,7  years4.5 1X D,9/13/2011,Cenestin
7, 5, menopasue,none,I feel young again_ calm_ happy_ a lot more energy. I recommended to everyone who suffers from menopause.,F,49,5  years0.625 1X D,7/13/2011,Cenestin
8, 5, menopause symptoms,None except for calmness_ less wrinkles_ smooth skin with no blemishes and no excess hair. Best product ever.,I recently stopped taking cenestin on my own when questions arose regarding breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy. Then I had to have a biopsy which was negative Thank God. I stopped using the cenestin with disastrous results_ hot flashes_ more facial hair & blemishes that I never had_ and I'm sure if my husband was asked my temperment has not been the best. Well_ I restated cenestin with an almost immediate change in my skin_ calmness_ and no hot flashes. I will continue to take cenestin and recommend this product to others after checking with their physician.,F,65,17  days 1X D,12/13/2010,Cenestin

11, 1, hsyterectomy at 43,started cenestin after the hysterectomy in 2001. Kept asking the Dr. if it was safe. I had read that you should only take it short term. Still had night sweats and weight gain from it. However_ in 2008 went in for a CAT scan for another issue and a tumor was discovered on pelvic wall. Was stage 4 cancer_ needed two major operations and approx. 18 mos of chemo. I had no ovaries but still developed ovarian cancer with also endometrial cancer cells. I truly believe it was caused by the cenestin feeding these cells over all those years. I had the surgeon stumped cause they couldn't even diagnose the cancer properly because there were so many different cancer cells within the biopsy piece. Had to send it out to three different labs for research. Has been a long road trying to recover. Wish I would have trusted my instincts and just lived with hot flashes rather than take a drug like this one.,,F,52,7  years,1/18/2010,Cenestin
12, 5, severe menopausal symptoms,none,Drug got rid of hot flashes_ vaginal dryness_ aches and pains_ fatigue and depression. I was able to lose almost 40 lbs. Libido is much more active (perhaps too much). It is as though the drug knocked 25 years off my age.,F,57,2  years,3/9/2009,Cenestin
13, 4, Hysterectomy,none,Second night after surgery I had a night sweat. My Dr. had me on 0.9 censetin the day I left the hospital. I do not have no night sweats at all. I am just scared a little because I was given a high dose_ my Dr. says it is a normal a dose. Is it really?,F,47,2  months,2/4/2009,Cenestin
14, 3, menopause side effects/hot flashes,breast tenderness_ skin break-outs_ and bloating   The worst side effects came about a day or two AFTER discontinuing Cenestin:  an over-all sensation of not feeling very well_ jittery.  After about five days of non-use_ the hot flashes returned but the other side effects (feeling unwell and jittery) went away.  I am now happily dealing with moderate (tolerable) hot flashes which is where I was prior to taking the drug.  In conclusion_ I wish I had never taken it.  I feel now that the side effects_ and possible risks of taking Cenestin_ did not make using the drug appropriate for me or worth it.,My Dr. never told me that I should only be taking Cenestin short-term_ as it was originally intended.,F,57,2  years,10/24/2008Email,Cenestin
15, 4, Hysterectomy,some heart flutter,I have found that 1/2 of the .625 tablet relieves hot flashes and night sweats for me. I have tried to stop taking the drug_ but the symptoms return.,F,52,3  years,2/28/2008,Cenestin
16, 5, hysterectomy,None,Have taken lowest dose (.3) for several years. Tried to stop once _ just cutting down to every other day_ and just didn't feel right. hair started getting thinner. Decided the benefits outweighed any risks. I get checkups every year_ eat healthy_ etc. Recommend the drug to anyone.,F,63,4  years,2/13/2008,Cenestin
17, 5, hot flashes_ memory loss_ depressed,vaginal discharge,I had been on Premarin for a couple of years after a complete hysterectomy and didn't like how I felt: blah_ moody and depressed. After losing 25 lbs my hot flashes and interrupted sleep (fatigue_ depression_ memory loss) started up again. Cenestin did the trick. I feel much better. An added bonus was that it got rid of vulvovaginal thinning and dryness_ although the vaginal discharge is quite heavy.,F,55,3  months,10/19/2007,Cenestin
18, 1, menopause,Within 2 days I had a yeast infection vaginally_ orally_ a urinary tract infection_ and a yeast type infection in my eyes as well as diarrea. Great_ no extreme PMS_ but my body is far worse off!,,F,50,12  days,10/3/2007,Cenestin
19, 5, early menopause & hot flashes,Have not had any side effects from taking this medication.,I have a family history of cancer and heart diseases_plus I am a diabetic_ so I did have concerns about this medication. I have been taking it for 3 years now at a high dose rate and have not encountered any problems nor have I had any drug interactions with it and other medication.,F,51,3  years,8/25/2007,Cenestin
20, 2, hot flashes,Migrane headaches_ tingling fingers_ wavy vision_ bleeding,The other commentors raved about cenestin. I'm glad it worked for them_ but the side effects were too great for me and I had to go off the medication.,F,54,2  months,7/31/2007,Cenestin
21, 5, Premature menopause,I have experienced NO side effects unless you say being calm_ centered_ healthy and energized side effects.,I take Cenestin along with Prometrium and have taken it for about 10 years. I read about it before FDA approval because the company that makes it is practically in my back yard. I was diagnosed with premature menopause at 32 years old. I am now 43 and my doctor had at first prescribed Premarin (with which I bled about 20 days out of each month. I was searching for something new when I read about Cenestin development. I kept asking my doctor for it and as soon as it was FDA approved I got my prescription (even though I had to educate my doctor on what it was first). I have been on it ever since and have recommended it to many. I don't know why this isn't THE leading menopause symptom remedy. Doctors should be more educated.,F,43,10  years,2/16/2007Email,Cenestin
22, 5, Hot flashes_ night sweats,This drug is wonderful - my doctor says it's plant-based. I take a VERY low dose - the lowest infact.  I used to take a higher dose but as time went on_ I found I didn't need it.  I take Cenestin with Prometrium.  Occasionally I have breast soreness but without this drug_ my life is a living hell.,,F,53,5  years,6/5/2006,Cenestin
23, 5, Dr. prescribed,I don't notice any side effects.,I take Cenestin with Prometruim before bedtime every night. The combination makes me calm.. I rarely get upset and I feel 25 again sexually_ I'm having fun..life is grand!  Before taking these I had severe hot flashes and I became angry too quickly.  I am so much happier now_ I'm feeling confident; all my friends ask me what I'm taking because they also want some.,F,50,1  years,1/31/2006,Cenestin
