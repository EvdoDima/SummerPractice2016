0, 1, Chronic foot pain,Horrific debilitating back pain with muscle spasms.  Almost went to ER last night.  I've been off it 24 hours and I'm improving already. The back pain started the day after my first dose but I didn't recognize that it was the nucynta that was causing it.  I wouldn't recommend this medicine to my worst enemy.  If I didn't take myself off it_ I probably would have eventually had a heart attack.,,F,66,3  weeks50 MG 3X D,4/10/2015Email,Nucynta er
1, 4, Pain Management,Welts_ Skin Inflammation,I really liked this medicine because it was one that didn't zone me out or cause constipation.  For a good bit of time I researched why I was having welts and skin redness (unrelated to other issues).  I finally stayed off the Nucynta for 2 weeks and discovered that the welts and skin inflammation pretty much went away. This_ after about a year trying to identify what was going on. For clarity_while I didn't have any withdrawal problems_ the pain came back with a vengeance while off the medicine.  I kept blaming an allergy to my cats_ food_ pollen_ etc_ only to find out it was none of them causing these problems.,M,61,18  months50mg 1X D,2/6/2015Email,Nucynta er
