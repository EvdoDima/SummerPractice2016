0, 5, Migraines,Achy joints_ fatigue_ sometimes an upset stomach,If I take at the onset of a migraine it usually subsides within 30 minutes,F,46,6  years 1X AN,8/2/2016,Zomig
1, 5, Migraine,GENERIC ZOMIG DOES NOT WORK,Get the BRANDED ZOMIG ONLY,,,5  years,7/17/2016,Zomig
2, 5, Chronic Migraines,Frequent urination_ facial numbness.,Within 45 minutes_ my headache is greatly reduced.  I've tried the generic Sumitriptan and it doesn't work nearly as effectively.  It can take a headache that is causing vomiting and severe pain down to an annoyance at worst.  The facial pain is somewhat of a relief as I've had chronic facial pain for the past 2.5 years_ so any relief is great_ but it does concern me as I would hate for that to become permanent.,M,41,30  days5mg 1X D,4/11/2016,Zomig
3, 4, Migraines,The migraine is gone within 45 minutes after taking zomig but then the side effects are crazy. I can't hold my head up_ my throat swells were its impossible to swallow anything_ I'm dizzy_ my stomach is very upset and my skin feels like its burning,I've been prescribed so many different prescriptions but the zomig is by far the only migraine medication that give me some relief_ the side effects i can really do without,F,49,4  years5mg,3/18/2016Email,Zomig
4, 5, Migraines,Difficulty swallowing.,No trouble except swallowing_ which is a concern. I no longer take it but I have permanent constriction in my throat from taking it over time. (However_ I only took 2.5 mg at a time_ cutting it in half because I only received 9 a month)_ I still suffered a lot of pain in head_ neck_ shoulders_ face that was excruciating when I didn't have any left to take of my monthly prescription. The zomig relieved the pain quickly when I took it_ however. But now I'm left with problems swallowing which other over the counter drugs also create_ to a lessor degree. Upon taking zomig I'd feel my arms becoming heavy as if whatever pain in my head was relaxing my body as the pain depleted. I was glad to have this medication because the pain was so bad. Of course now I realize I have histamine intolerance so it's like foods with histamine a built up in my system causing this but it was confusing because one day a certain food didn't bother me and another it did. I didn't know then about histamine intolerance however. I still have it and I have to be careful what I eat and vary my diet. ,F,67,10  years5,2/25/2016Email,Zomig
5, 5, Migraines,Sleepiness_ skin is extremely sensitive to warm/hot water_  occasional nausea,This stuff is great.  I tried everything over-the-counter and nothing worked.  Relieves my headaches completely within 30 minutes.  My doctor prescribed the 5 mg tablet but I cut them in half to lessen the nausea side effect.,F,37,4  years2.5 1X W,10/13/2015,Zomig
6, 3, Hemiplegic Migraine,Tingling in the back of my head. Tightness in my neck and pain from neck to my right eye. Extreme nausea. Drunk-like feeling. Loss of coordination.,This took action within 2 hours_ the side effects kicked in after 45mins - 1hr. I felt awful. Could not hold my head up_ had to keep tilting it to find some relief. Nearly threw up from nausea. Felt like I was in some weird drunken stupor and could not walk straight. Migraine subsided substantially though after about 1.5hrs. I found that this was not supposed to be prescribed for hemiplegics so perhaps this was the issue along with my doctor who prescribed me this medication. I would sincerely advise anyone thinking of taking this medicine to try an alternative first if possible.,F,23,1  days2.5mg 1X D,9/11/2015,Zomig
7, 4, Migraines,No side effects that I've noticed.,I've suffered with chronic migraines since I was 13. I'm now 27 and have seen countless doctors and neurologists and tried countless medications. Zomig is the first and only drug to even touch my migraines. Zomig doesn't completely stop my migraines but it brings it from a level 10 (where I'm vomiting or fainting)_ down to a level 6. It's still very painful and I have to remain lying in bed_ in the dark_ but it's not bad enough to make me vomit. Zomig is amazing but I wish I could get more than 6 pills at once.,F,27,4  years2.5 mg,8/17/2015,Zomig
8, 5, Migraines,Tingling burning sensation on the back of the head muscle aches and pains in the joints especially in feet tightness in the neck and chest and down both arms hypersensitive to warm water sometimes sleepy when eating within two hours of taking medication it's almost like eating something sour kind of things in the back of your jaw,I have suffered from migraine since I was 13 years old this is the only medication I have ever taken that will take the headache away mine typically used to last 6 to 12 hours no matter what I would take now I take Zomig 5 milligram tablets and it's gone usually within the hour I do have some side effects but I have found eating something for example a half of a peanut butter sandwich no matter how nauseated I am can help with the side effects also naproxen or an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen seems to help with the side effects as well I read many side effects on this feed and yes they are scary but the medication does work for me the side effects are still there so if I can eat something small like a sandwich take the medication and lie down for an hour I'm a hundred percent better when I get up I highly recommend this medication for severe migraine sufferers,F,47,3  years5 MG tab,8/16/2015Email,Zomig
9, 5, headaches,Major fatigue.  Frequent urination and feels like I have a sunburn all over if I shower within a few hours of taking it.,Can't live without it!

11, 4, Frequent Migraines,Sore throat_ achy jaw_ dry mouth_ extreme fatigue,This medicine is amazing if you take it right when you have the smallest headache. If you wait for a bad headache or migraine it is useless. Take it even if you do not know if the small headache will develop further. Can take a second dose 2 hours later if needed.,F,29,5  years 2X AN,4/25/2015,Zomig
12, 3, Chronic Daily Migraine,Head pain got less severe within an hour of taking but second dose was needed. I felt very strange. My eyelid crumpled up. I was very tired but found it hard to fall asleep. I had some crazy dreams and woke several times during the night. My throat felt tight and I experienced a heavy chest. This morning I'm exhausted and ache all over. I'm feeling very forgetful.,I took this medication an hour before I went to bed. It was prescribed as I am sensitive to sumitriptan. I still have a nagging head pain this morning but I'm glad the migraine went last night!,F,29,1  days2.5/5,1/29/2015Email,Zomig
13, 4, Migraine,Feel disoriented_ hard to concentrate_ a little dizzy_ sleepy_ frequent urination_ heightened senses - taste touch hearing.,Side effects have got worse the longer I take it. I'm pretty much incapacitated for most of the day_ can 't drive until about 9 hours after use. Still much better than a migraine as it does relieve all of my symptoms most of the time and always helps considerably.,F,67,12  years2.5 mg 1X AN,1/3/2015Email,Zomig
14, 4, Cluster headache / migraine,Chest tightening. Sore throat and irritation from nasal spray. Hyperaesthesia on scalp. Mild fatigue. Mild nausea. Slight euphoria several hours after dose,I tolerate this far better than sumatriptan which sends my blood pressure through the roof and I get out of breath. Zomig even at the 5mg level is fairly well tolerated. Nasal spray starts to take effect in around 10 mins. By 30 mins_ the pain is all gone.,M,34,6  times5mg 1X AN,12/11/2014,Zomig
15, 4, Severe migraines,I have always been sensitive to medications and have side effects. Zomig is the best I've tried and I have tried A LOT. Migraine lessens after 30 minutes_ disappears in an hour. I get extremely sensitive skin (hurts to touch scalp_ brush hair_ body feels over sensational) my throat tightens and I get a burning in my neck. Not altogether unpleasant. It does make me sleepy and feel like not moving whatsoever.,Overall very happy with this. When none of my medications work_ this makes it all better.,F,17,2  months,11/5/2014,Zomig
16, 5, Migraines,Has been a lifesaver.  Pain stops within 30 mins of taking.  I've had migraines daily now for over a week and worried about rebound headaches.  One thing I do notice is a feeling of tingling in my arms and sinus drainage with sneezing.  Is this normal with drug?? Doing more research and what the long term affects are.,,F,45,1  days5mg,10/11/2014,Zomig

22, 3, for migraine,Very few side effects_ slight tingling in arms_ neck and nasal passages.,this drug has always been so very effective in relieving my migraines which I used to get once or twice a week.  Zomig usually worked within the hour and that was on only half a tablet ie 1.25mg.My problem however is now medication overuse or rebound headaches.  I suffer migraines or headaches now on between 18 and 24 days a month now and the only thing that shifts them is yet another dose of Zomig.  It is ruining my life.  I wake up every morning with a bad head_ a stiff neck_ aching arms.  The headaches vary from one sided migraine headache to a dreadful pain in the top of my head or even in my face or back of my head.  Even after taking the zomig_ I don't now feel well until after lunch. I was never warned about medication overuse in the first place or else I would never have let my dosage creep up and up.  I don't feel the drug companies or GP's do enough to warn people about this.,F,62,12  years2.5gg 1X AN,3/4/2013Email,Zomig
23, 5, Frequent migraines,No side effects here.  Actually makes me feel so great!,Zomig has been a lifesaver for me.  I used to take Relpax_ which was also great_ but insurance all of a sudden refused to cover it.  Tried Imitrex and didn't work and had horrible side effects.  Zomig takes the migraine away in about 30 minutes and I feel great afterward.   I wish it would go generic_ because it's very expensive and my insurance limits the quanity.,F,46,2  years5mg 2X W,12/20/2012,Zomig

33, 5, Acute frequent migraines,Occasional dizziness,This medication has been a life saver for me! I have had acute migraines for 33 years_ I could be down and out for several days_ vomiting_ nausea_ intense pain.  Suffering approximately 12 -15 attacks per month.  When I take Zomig_ the migraine is gone within 30 minutes and I usually only need to take one 2.5mg pill.  It's fantastic_ I don't need water to swallow it_ so it can be taken anytime anywhere.  I no longer need to take codeine products which only slightly minimized the severity and no more gravol to keep down the nausea.  I had tried imitrex_ which gave me severe stomach cramps_ which also kept me out of commission (hard to say which was worse_ the cramps or the migraine).  Zomig has given me the freedom to make plans and keep them.  I have an active life again and only wish this had been available years ago.,F,45,10  months2.5 1X D,10/21/2011Email,Zomig
34, 5, Migraines_ 1-2 a month,Sore joints_ sensitivity in extremities and skin_ cold nose_ over-stimulated salivary glands_ sore scalp_ and feelings of drowsiness that eventually pass.,I started getting migraines about 10 years ago when my kids were toddlers. The migraines usually occur during my period every month_ sometimes twice_ and usually with 1 or 2 days of bounce backs. I was originally prescribed Imitrex (nasal_ 20mg)_ and the side effects were so painful_ I would cry trying to decide which was worse -- the migraine or the cure. I was switched to Zomig_ which was an immediate relief. I usually will take 1/2 5mg pill at onset and if I can sleep for a little while_ am all set. If I don't catch it on time_ I have to take a whole pill. Zomig truly did give me days and days of my life back_ and I'm grateful. The last year_ though_ I am finding that I have an alarming loss of memory; I can't remember something I did_ or where I was heading_ or who I was with... It is scaring me enough that I think I will give up the pill entirely (the only medication I take) and treat any migraines with OTC meds and sleep.,F,42,4  years5MG 1X D,10/6/2011Email,Zomig

My throat started to constrict and my vision went black I was exceedingly dizzy and tired and was unable to breathe properly.

My side effects are minimal_ a little tightness in the neck / throat and some yawning_ slight tiredness. It relieves EVERYTHING - headache pain_ light sensitivity_ aura_ sound sensitivity and nausea! Such a blessing!,"I am having more and more difficulty getting a prescription for this from my family doctor. Insurance now only covers ""4 headaches a month"" and of course you have to keep your cholesterol low to be allowed to continue with the prescription but this medicine has kept me functional and happy for the last 11 years. Such a blessing!

I started having migraines 16 years ago OTC drugs did not touch the pain.I had either a full blown migraine which would put me in bed and fully out of action for up to three days. Severe head and neck pain  vomiting_ dark quiet room etc. Or  I would just have a dull ache for days which made concentrating difficult. Thankfully my doctor prescribed triptan meds. If I take a Zomig early in the attack the pain is usually gone within two hours or less.  I have up to 4 migraine headaches a week and they will just appear from nowhere so I take the Zomig rapimelt.

49, 5, Persistent migraine,Headaches like migraine but eminating from sinus area.,I am third generation who suffers from migraines. I used to get a couple a year when I was in my early teens which have escalated frequency wise over the years. I was prescribed zomig about 5 years ago by a Consultant. I found them to be fantastic and cured me with no side effects within an hour. Since taking them however my migraines have become more and more frequent to the degree that I now wake up at 5.30am every morning to take a zomig so that I can get up a few hours later. I have taken a zomig every day now for about two years. I believe that I am now adicted to them and that it is the zomig that is now causing the migraines. I try periodically to go cold turkey but I can have a debilitaitng migraine for up to 4 or 5 days and eventually I give in and take a zomig and I am back to normal within an hour again. They are fantastic but please be careful that you don't become addicted. I find it very worrying to read some of the reveiws on this website especially the potential links to heart problems?,M,45,5  years2.5mg 1X D,12/31/2010Email,Zomig
50, 5, Three day migraines every fortnight,Awful zombie-like feeling after taking. Drowsy_ nauseous and the pain intensified temporarily. Operated in a dream-like state for hours afterwards.,I wanted to kiss the person responsible for this drug. I got my life back after suffering three day migraines for over twenty five years. Other drugs didn't touch it. They just made me feel even more sick. I couldn't believe there was a drug which aborted the migraine. Wonder drug! The side effects weren't pleasant_ but were a breeze compared to frequently spending three days in a darkened room_ suffering intense throbbing pain_ dizziness and nausea. True suffering. I wanted to die or bang my head against something hard to stop the pain. (Oh migraine is SO NOT like a mere headache!I get cross that non-migraine sufferers say they have migraine yet still function normally! They have no idea.....)However_ I must warn against the side effects. I took Zomig regularly...on average about one a week_ at the onset of a migraine. In 2003 I suffered a heart attack. Not sure if it was severe angina or a full blown heart -attack. I now have a stent in my heart after having an angioplasty. On my records the doctor states there was no real reason for my heart troubles. I was fit and not overweight. It came out of the blue. Zomig is contra-indicated for those with heart problems_ so to my dismay I was taken off it. (I felt like an addict being deprived her drugs!) However_ I had to take antenolol_ a beta-blocker as a matter of course after my heart incident. (I also have to take a small dose of asprin and a statin.) Guess what? No more migraines. I have been told the beta-blocker is the key.,F,56,7  years5mg 1X AN,12/15/2010,Zomig
51, 5, Chronic Migraines,My side effects:  Enhanced sense of taste_ temporary light sleepiness (but can go easily without having to lay down). Here's a weird one: Memory Loss  Also_ I'm not sure if this is directly related to Zomig_ but recently I had twitching in my eye lids.,I continuously research medical advances on migraines. There is NOTHING out there that will prevent them. I tried not drinking wine_ not eating cheeses_ stuff with nitrates etc. I've taken all sorts of prophylactics that were prescribed. It's all BS. If you have migraines go ahead and enjoy your wine. Not drinking it doesn't change anything.  Zomig WORKS but it's a reactive remedy.  I don't know about other triptans_ because I've never taken them. My migraines started when I was about 16 yrs old and became more severe at age 25 when I had my daughter.  They became so overpowering that I could not get out of bed for 3 days at a time. Since my neuro started me on Zomig_ I can function and live a normal life. My dose is 5MG_ but I divide it into 3 parts and 1/3 of the pill normally takes care of everything: migraine_ nausea_ energy loss. The only thing it doesn't take care of is my cold hands and cold feet_ which now I know are related to migraines. I have also found that Zomig takes care of my headaches (Note: Headaches are NOT Migraines). I'm a little worried about my memory loss. Sometimes I will ask my family the same question two or three times in a row without remembering it. They point this out to me and it's a little weird. I'm only 36. I also finished my MBA recently and I found remembering concepts substantially more difficult. I usually had to contribute about 3x more work than my counterparts.  Something is definitely affecting my memory and it happens most often aft,F,36,1  days5 MG 4X M,12/4/2010Email,Zomig
52, 3, headache,tired_ bad leg aches_ spacey_ and depressed,Like everyone here; zomig only thing that works for headache; i figured out I could take a forth of a 5 mg pill and it almost always works with less side effects....why wouldn't my doc have tried lower dose first?? Began tae kwon do lessons with hard workout and began getting bad leg pains when I take it now_ though. Feel like a zombie_ and tired and depressed_ but better than a headache and lasts only 1 day; before headaches were 2 to 3 dys; have traced headaches to food; msg and chemcials_ which is in almost everything_ bananas_ over ripe avocadoes_ most wines_ vegetables that are cooked and over 2 days old_ vegetables that are not real fresh_ many leafy greens_ red meat and more.,F,53,2  years1.25 mg 7X M,12/1/2010,Zomig
53, 4, Migraines,The most annoying side effect has been frequent urination.  Zomig also makes me quite sleepy.,I have found that Zomig works quite well on my migraines_ but it does leave me quite tired_ to the point where it really is difficult keeping my eyes open.  Also_ the frequent urination is annoying because when I have a migraine_ I want to lay down and sleep_ but having to urinate every 15 minutes (urgently) gets in the way of this.  I have found this to be true for other migraine medications I've tried.  I'm going to keep up with the Zomig for a while longer to see if it really is the right medication for me.  I also find that after taking it I feel like I'm a bit spacey...like in a bit of a dream-state.  I'm a teacher_ and all these side effects interfere with my ability to teach after taking the medication--focusing is difficult.,F,39,3  months5mg 1X D,11/17/2010,Zomig
54, 1, migraines,Constant muscle spasms in neck_ shoulder_ upper back on one side_ and spasms in face on same side.,"Zomig was effective_ but apparently_ triptans can cause neurological issues such as dystonia and spasms. Prior to taking Zomig_ I was on Imitrex for years. After seeing many doctors and reviewing literature on the subject_ I am convinced that triptans caused the ""movement disorder"" I have. I will never take triptans again.",F,42,6  months 8X M,11/3/2010,Zomig
55, 5, Migraine,Frequent urination_ tightness in head_ tired_ sore throat,I now have a life!! Suffered with migraines since I was 17_ started off 1/2 every few months to every month in my 20's. It got so bad I was having 3 or more a month. Tried different medication/herbal/acupuncture the lot. After having 3 children they just got worse. Thank god I now have zomig_ I now have my life back and can actually plan a day out! Thank you.,F,37,3  years2.5mg 6X M,10/5/2010,Zomig
56, 5, migraine headaches,Usually none.  One morning before work I took 5 mg and had to do a lot of getting up and down and had some light headedness; especially when lowering my head to look under cabinets and then standing up.  1st time ever (I also had taken 800 mg of ibuprofen because I had a sore bad-don't know if one had anything to do with the other-so I now refrain from mixing the two.),My dad suffered from migraines his whole life and sadly never really got any relief.  The first time I took Zomig and my headache floated away I though it was a miracle.  It has never failed me...never.  Unfortunately I have not been able to afford insurance for many years and it is a difficult a least to keep a stash on hand.  I HAVE to have it when I get a migraine as nothing else will help.  Be careful buying them from Canada_ the Chinese make imitations that only the real migraine sufferer with know are fake...God bless Doctors that get samples and the barter system.  It really is a great break through but my wife keeps telling me it going to kill me someday. At least the last 9 years have been a blessing if it does kill me.,M,61,9  years2.5 & 5 mg 2X W,10/2/2010,Zomig
57, 4, migraine,weakness_ fatigue_tender scalp but most recently excessive runny nose_ terrible bouts of sneezing_ itchy skin and eyes. These latest side effects are incapacitating.,It does help eliminate the headache which lasts 3 days and requires more than one dose over that time.,F,52, 2.5 mg. 1X AN,9/3/2010,Zomig
58, 5, Migraines,I feel dizzy_ loopy_ tired_ my whole body feels bruised_ I am a total space case on this med_ but yet 95% of the time it gets rid of my migraine.  So I rather suffer all the side effects then have a migraine_ which just makes me so sick.  I can deal with almost any pain but migraines are the worst.,I've suffered for migraines since I can remember_ as far back as 5th grade.  I've tried everything from A to Z_ Zomig seems to be by far the most affective RX for my migraines.  I've yet to try the nasal spray but to like the pills that dissolve_ I get the fastest results with those.  Only problem I seem to be having is when I wake up w/a migraine I'm doomed no matter what. My migraine last for 2 days when this happens_ no matter what.My insurance only pays for 6 pills a month_ doc gives me samples when he can.,F,46,3  years5 MG 1X AN,8/24/2010Email,Zomig
59, 5, Chronic Migraines,sleepy_ lethargic_ grateful,Zomig has been my savior having had chronic migraines daily for 34 yrs.  The debilitating migraines require the full 5mg ZMT_ the others I can usually manage with the 2.5mg.  My biggest problem is getting my insurance company to pay for the meds.  Now that Imitrex has made a generic_ my doctor will no longer receive Zomig samples which really helped offset the small amount the insurance company allows.  I live on the Mexico border and Zomig is no less expensive there and difficult to find.  Lately I've been taking a 25mg Phenergan (generic) and 1 (one) Skelaxin (now generic) that seems to help at times when I am running low on Zomig.  I take Fioricet also if the headache is really painful_ but Fioricet like so many pain meds causes  rebound HA's.  I no longer take any OTC meds for the same reason.  I also am affected by weather (low barometric pressure)_ dairy_ peanuts/peanut oil_ bananas_ msg_ nitrates_ yeast_ not enough sleep_ too much sleep_ stress_ et._al.  My doctor absolutely forbids Niacin.  It causes severe migraines.  I can't take B vitamins_ Vitamin E_ too many anything with antioxidants as it opens the blood vessels_ causing better blood flow to the brain_ which is good for most people_ but for me causes migraines.,F,61,10  years5 mg ZMT 1X D,7/22/2010Email,Zomig
