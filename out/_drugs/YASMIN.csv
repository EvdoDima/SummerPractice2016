1, 4, Regulation / avoid pregnancy,Always loved this birth control. Never gave me any side effects. I just went off of it for 2 months and recently started again but this time on the generic brand Zarah 28. I went to bed tonight a tad hungry (I guess I ate dinner to early) and took my pill around 12 midnight. I woke up with extreme nausea and cramping at 5am this morning. I hope it is the pill. I can't see what else it would be. I've also had bad cramps and been spotting for 5 days now. A few days ago my spotting was so bad I had horrible cramps resulting in diarrhea that lasted about 3 hours. I hope this is just a side effect of my body getting used to it again. I feel so sick right now I'm having trouble typing but closing my eyes gives me such spins. This is strange because when I was on it all these past years I never noticed this.,,F,27,3  years30,4/5/2016,Yasmin
2, 1, regulate PMS_ acne_ contraception,terrible mood swings_ painful menstruation_ stomach problems_ chest pain_ back pain_ vaginal dryness_ painful sex_ anxiety_ IBS_ nausea_ hair loss_ hot flashes,WORST drug i have ever taken. i was on aviane but switched to zarah for better acne control in Jul 2014. i wholeheartedly regret it now!!! I felt sick from Jan-Apr 2015 and didn't know why and I've again felt the same sickness only worse from Sept 2015-now(Mar 2016). My stomach constantly feels empty_ hungry_ tight_ and that it's on fire_ i'm nauseated_ my stools keep floating_ and my bloating gets worse around when it's time for my period. My hair has even began to fall out! Zarah (Yasmin) made my GAD symptoms resurface to the near point of panic attacks which i haven't had in 3 years. It made me take so many hot flashes and i'm not menopausal! This drug made my vagina so dry and painful_ I haven't been able to masturbate at all for almost a year!! also it did nothing to ease my flow_ i clot so much from this drug. this evil pill also gave me IBS which gets severe around the start of my period. i missed classes at my uni because of yasmin. i've been off of it since Feb 2016 and switched back to aviane_ i'm still waiting to feel better after all its put me through_ the withdrawals are almost worse than the actual side effects. never in my life had i wanted to kill myself so badly,F,20,1.5  years3mg 1X D,3/15/2016Email,Yasmin

5, 4, PCOS_ oily skin_ acne_ missed perio,Extreme thirst_ bad heartburn_ arm and hand numbness_cramps_random nausea_ and bloating.,Pros: Regular period_ less mood swings (then all the bc pills I have been on)_ skin isn't oily anymore_ cleared most the acne_ slowed down the excessive hair growth_ and gave me back my breasts.

7, 4, Regulate periods/skin,I was taking Yasmin then Ocella_ the generic. Side effects were increased GERD_ migraines_ and temperature sensitivity.,Ocella/Yasmin cleared up my skin problems and regulated my cycle. However_ I have had a ton of health issues occur. My adrenal glands were pumping out a ton of cortisol_ I was not absorbing Vitamin C (was diagnised with Scurvy)_ was not absorbing D or B either. My eyesight went rapidly down hill_ and I ended up with hypothyroidism. I am now on a ton of medications and vitamins and have too many specialists for my age. I also had an unknown tumor form on my spinal chord_ and my cecum twisted. I now wonder if there was a connection. Ocella is no longer controlling my cycle_ and after about 10+ years_ I am changing BC pills. It will be interesting to see what happens.,F,43,10  years1 x D,8/22/2015Email,Yasmin
8, 1, Birth control,I just woke up having a panic attack_ I have felt angry_ depressed and suicidal this week and I'm outraged that my doctor prescribed this evil drug to me with my history of severe depression and anxiety disorder. NEVER TAKE YASMIN.,This drug could have driven me to suicide if I had not researched my recent anxiety and worsened depression and realised that Yasmin is the reason for it. It should be banned. I am seriously thinking of taking legal advice on this matter.,F,33,10  days 1X D,8/5/2015Email,Yasmin

17, 1, I was actually taking zarah,Zarah caused: panic attacks_ anxiety_ fatigue_ suicidality_ muscle fatigue_ headaches_ blurred vision_ hazy vision_ sense of being out of it_ sense of not being well_ paranoid_ hypochondriac_ crying_ mood swings_ loss of appetite_ loss of sex drive_ tingling and numbness in hands_ feet_ arms. And more,I had been on ocella for many years and then was switched over to zarah. Everything was fine at first but then after about a month I had my first panic attack ever. Few weeks later I had another one. Few days later I had another. And then proceeded to have either panic attacks or bad anxiety every day following. Went to doctor and had blood tests and ekg. All came back normal. I decided it was the pills after I looked up the side effects. I was 1 week into my third month and stopped. Had my period for 10 days during which was extremely moody and crying all the time with anxiety but not as bad. Was pretty good for 2 weeks with mild anxiety. Now it's been 3.5 weeks since I stopped the pill and I don't know if I'm supposed to get my period soon but I've had cramps_ weird vision problems_ dizziness_ headaches everyday_ crying_ tingling_ muscle fatigue and just tired all of the time. From what I have ready it has taken many people months to recover. It has almost been a month for me and things were pretty good and I was getting back to myself. This is a bump in the road and I hope it goes away soon. I will continue to recover. You are not alone and you are not crazy. I know it feels like you are all alone when this stuff is going on but believe me. You aren't. You will get better. I will never take this pill and probably no pill ever again. It has seriously messed me and my hormones up and I have never felt worse than this experience. I would not recommend Zarah to anyone. It's no,F,25,2  months,4/29/2015Email,Yasmin
18, 3, Birth Control,- Went from an A cup to a C- plenty of weight gain- depression/anxiety/guilty feelings,The pill does what it's supposed to_ I've been sexually active with my boyfriend for around a year and a half and never worried about pregnancy. I've decided to tough out the side effects because it's worth it... But don't get me wrong they do suck. I miss having motivation to do things and being happy without forcing it.,F,18,2  years,4/21/2015,Yasmin
19, 2, Birth control,Headaches for the first few days_ mild nausea for the first week_ ongoing breast tenderness_ spotting every day_ dryness and pain after sex lasting up to 3 days.,For me it's just not worth it - I never experienced this discomfort before taking yasmin and now I don't want to have sex with my partner due to the pain afterwards. I'll be stopping before I've finished the first pack as the side effects are getting worse rather than better.,F,23,3  weeks,4/14/2015Email,Yasmin
20, 1, birth control,acne_ weight gain_ awful mood swings_ depression_ bloating_ migraines_ decrease in sex drive,I understand that this pill works differently for everyone_ but it was absolutely not for me at all. It started out absolutely fine. For the first 3 weeks I had no weight gain_ no headaches_ I felt great but after the first pack (and the first break_ which was shorter) everything fell apart. I know I sound incredibly dramatic but honestly I can say that this pill was really awful for me. I argued with my boyfriend constantly over absolutely everything_ I was miserable_ I gained weight_ I had migraines all the time_ completely lost all desire to have sex_ I just didn't feel like myself at all. I'm usually a really happy and energetic person_ so for me_ it was something I really struggled with. My boyfriend begged me to come off it_ so I have and its only been 5 days since coming off it and I already feel a lot better. Desperate to try and find something which works for me. I tried Cerazette before and loved it_ but wasn't happy with not having any breaks...the quest for the perfect pill continues! :),F,21,2  months30 1X D,4/8/2015,Yasmin

22, 1, Birth control,I didn't notice any side effects for a few years. Then I started experiencing extreme fatigue_ hair loss_ depression_ anxiety_ mood swings. I attributed it to stress in my life at that time. However when the stressful situation had eased I still experienced these symptoms. I Started to think I was just a moody miserable person. Luckily_ I went off birth control and I feel like a new person.,Don't take it...,F,31,10  years,3/17/2015Email,Yasmin
23, 2, Birth Control,Went on Yasmin approximately 4 months after giving birth to my son.  After a month i became unusually  depressed_ had no interest in sex and was generally  tired all the time. I thought it may have been post partum depression  but i had none of these symptoms after the birth of my baby. It was when I started take in the pills that I had these feelings.  I have been off the pill for 4 days now.  I am having headaches every evening  since then.  (I rarely get headaches).  I hope it is just making it way out of my system.  I have decided to try Mirena instead.  I will wait a month or so before doing so.,,F,35,6  months,3/13/2015,Yasmin

Another side effect is you do not take this medication after just having a baby. Shands Jacksonville sure didn't mind giving it to me. And no one seems to want to compensate me for all that I loss.

I'm sure this is down to Yasmin as it has co-insided with my cycle and previous to this_ my migraines we're controlled with simple medication. I now need pain killing injections when i have an episode. I will be coming of this ASAP and going back to my old pill_ which also did a better job of clearing my skin up. Sorry folks.

I couldn't go to work as i felt depressed_ stressed and sick constantly. I have now stopped taking Yasmin and already within a week i can feel the difference. I'm not saying this is a bad pill but i wouldn't recommend it long term.,F,25,2  years30 1X D,1/28/2014Email,Yasmin
