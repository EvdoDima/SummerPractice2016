3, 1, heart transplant,rash_ severe peripheral edema_ mouth sores_ swollen tongue_ swollen eyelids_ red around the eyes_ breathing difficulties_ pneumonitis.,Side effects can increase over time_ rather than show themselves immediately.  Doctors do not have great familiarity with this drug_ nor is there a good amount of data about dosing and side effects.  Take with caution.  Report all side effects to dr.,M,45,60  days.5 1X D,1/12/2014,Rapamune
4, 1, Kidney Transplant - anti-rejection,Zits everywhere_ hair loss_ skin tone went pale_ nausea_ loss of vision in right eye (corrected later surgically_ apparent scarring)_ Charcot Foot (increased neuropathy caused bones to shatter_ foot injury is permanent - surgery would have 50% chance of losing foot).,Transplant doctors wanted to try to treat 'side effects'_ but when vision started to fail I stopped taking it - bad effects lingered. It apparently stops my body from fighting bacteria and slows growth (eg:hair). Hair recovered somewhat when I quit_ with rogaine it is recovering well. Fortunately surgery fixed my vision (infection of cornea)_ but foot damage is permanent so I'm now handicapped.,M,55,2  months,7/13/2009Email,Rapamune
5, 5, Kidney Transplant,Elevated cholosterol,Great drug!!!  No side effect accept for the higher cholesterol.  No rejection.  I feel as if I did prior to getting sick 5 years ago.,F,30,2  years,12/6/2007Email,Rapamune
6, 1, Kidney Transplant,Anemia_ elevated lipids_ malabsorbtion of food_ liqiud stools_ wounds wouldn't heal_ scarring from simple scratches_ bruising_ feelings of hopelessness_ high blood pressure_ rapid heart rate,I had to go on mulitple medications just to treat the side effects of this drug.  I lost 20 pounds because my food was not being absorbed into my body.  I could hardly walk by the time I was taken off of it.  My resting pulse was 130! I had to switch transplant centers just to find a doctor who could see that it was the rapamune making me sick.  My lipids were so high I was told I was going to have a heart attack.  I was only 25 at the time! Run far away from this drug.  It seemed like a miracle drug at first_ but turned into a nightmare. My dose ranged from 2mg to 12 mg because my absorbtion was so bad.  It is an unpredictable_ dangerous_ killer drug.,F,27,2  years,10/31/2007,Rapamune
7, 1, Liver transplant,Rash_ reduced white count_ reduced platelet count_ severe edema_ increased creatnine. All counts were way out of limits. Dr's said Rapamune attacked my bone marrow.,Had taken NEORAL for eleven years following liver transplant when Dr switched me because Rapamune is supposed to be easier on the kidneys. This drug may do wonders for others but apparently I'm allergic to it. Result was nine days in the hospital having my stomach tapped_ receiving platelets_ hemoglobin and various meds to repair what this drug did to me. NOT ENOUGH WARNING ABOUT POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!!!,F,68,6  days,11/2/2006,Rapamune
