1, 1, Chronic insomnia,Did nothing for my insomnia. I slept my usual 4 hours. Awakened with pounding head_ dry mouth_ dizziness_ and nausea. I flushed the rest of the pills and will go back to benadryl and herbal otc sleep aids as my amount and quality of sleep are as bad on trazodone without side effects. Horrible drug. Reinforced why I am loath to take prescription meds.,See above.,F,49,1  days100 mg,6/23/2016,Trazodone hcl
2, 5, For sleeping issues,It gives me a headache at times when I wake up the next morning and sometimes makes me off balance from a sitting to standing position. I have lost 40 lbs due to no appetite and light exercise in a resistance pool. This has helped me tremendously before my quality of life suffered.,I would recommend this medication to people who have severe insomnia. However take it in bed because I have found that it has a fast acting release and if you are not settled down and ready to sleep the medication is not as effective I have found for me.,F,42,4  months150mg x2,6/16/2016Email,Trazodone hcl

22, 1, Sleep_ ease anxiety,Restless legs_ head and eye aches the next day_ dry mouth_ grogginess_ severe nausea.,My doctor prescribed this medication to help me sleep and to hopefully curb my anxiety enough so I would be able to eat well again (my anxiety takes away my appetite and in some cases will not let me eat at all). I took this one night and had the worst side effects of any medicine I've been on--and I've tried a lot. It didn't make me tired_ yet the next day I was extremely groggy. I couldn't eat at all since I was so nauseous. I took a small bite of a muffin and had to spit it out because I felt I was going to throw up. I have a headache advil won't cure and my eyes are sore and tired. I constantly feel like I have to use the bathroom and am quite gassy for some reason. I only took it one night_ but I'm not trying it again. I can't afford these side effects when I'm already having trouble eating and I have a 3 year old child to take care of. I've been basically bedridden the whole day.,F,24,1  days60,11/17/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

25, 1, Sleepliness,I started out taking 50 mg a day at night because I couldn't sleep. I went to sleep easily and slept great. After a while the dosage had to be increased to 100 and then to 150. I suffered from dry mouth and dry eyes terribly. I began to get acid reflux and was put on medication for that. I didn't connect the medication to the acid reflux which kept getting worse. Then I began to experienced racing heart. To the point where I had to go to the dr. And have tests. They concluded that the trazodone was causing the fast heartbeat..and took me off. I went thru hell getting off it. It took months. And then one day I realized that my acid reflux was gone. The stomach bloating was gone. The dry eyes and dry mouth were gone. I still haven't found a solution to my sleep problems but I'll never take trazodone again.,,F,69,3  years150 1X D,9/13/2015Email,Trazodone hcl
26, 4, Chronic insomnia_ depression_ PTSD,My problem with trazodone is my body got extremely use to it which is why I'm at 150mg(and I refuse to go higher). The medicine has honestly helped me so much over the years BUT within the past 2 years it has over the time stopped working for me because I've had to also take OTC sleep aid to assist with the sleeping or even if I did take OTC I still would stay awake and not sleep (granted my insomnia especially as of lately since my grandmother has passed has been acting as if it's insomnia on steroids). Another thing is I only take it at night to sleep - regardless if I've eaten 30 minutes before_ an hour_ or even 3 hours before I get so nauseous when I go to lay down to the point that keeps me awake. I don't know why it is doing this and neither does my doctor.,The thing about trazodone_ it doesn't work for everyone just like any medications. I have been on it for 7 years and only until the last two years I've had problems.,F,24,7  years150,8/29/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

Had to take welbutrin to curb EXTREME anxiety caused by trazadone. (A FEAR like I have never experienced before! I felt like my world was (literally) spinning out of control) I repeat_ DO NOT TAKE TRAZADONE! It will mess up your life! This drug should be taken off the market!,,F,36,8  days50 mg 1X D,7/23/2015Email,Trazodone hcl
28, 1, chronic insomnia,groggy_ low in energy and tired. Shortness of breath_ breathing through my mouth. Somewhat flu like symptoms_ headache it's hard to bear the weight of my head on my body_ dry mouth with chocking sensation and blocked nostrils so I'm breathing through my mouth. Very heavy chest with pounding heart. literally I'm hearing my heart beat from last 26 hours. Oh and I forgot to mention pounding and clog ears.  Back pain_ neck pain and some visual hallucinations.,"I was happily taking Ativan 0.5 mgs from last two years but I asked my doc to give me something else with ""least possible side effects"". I asked because I was having absolute dependency and immunity to Ativan_ so my doctor Rx trazodone stating that it's ""ONLY"" going make me groggy for a few days_ and that's it_ but last night around 9:30 p.m_ and it knocked me out in about 20 minutes. It's good because I don't want insomnia_ but it gave me hangover feelings. I had a very restless night because I woke up several times with thoughts of fear and confusion. My chest was very heavy and I had such a hard time breathing. It's been about 26 hours since I took it but my chest is still very heavy and I am short in breath and continuously breathing through my mouth.  I hardly made it through the day because I was so low in energy and had a foggy mind. Yes my happy bubble has burst and I can't wait to get rid of these side effects.I am not going to take this drug anymore and I won't recommend it to anyone. Also_ I forgot to mention my daughter took this drug a few years ago and she quit it within a week.",F,50,1  days25 mgs 1X D,7/21/2015Email,Trazodone hcl
29, 1, insomnia,Restlessness_ terror_ anxiety,My experience taking this medication was so awful I have been unable to bring myself to try another medication and it's been over a year. This made me tired. I have never been so exhausted. It made my brain sleepy but gave my body a mind of its own. I could fall asleep for a few minutes then would awaken with the over whelming need to shake my arms. I spent 10hrs sitting in my backyard crying and a good amount of that time; trying to punch my own arms until they fell asleep. I wouldn't wish the experience on my enemies.,F,25,1  days50MG,6/22/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

32, 1, Insomnia_ depression/anxiety,Nasal congestion_ frequent urination_ dizziness_ headache_ bloating_ extreme thirst_ next day grogginess_ sleeplessness_ heartburn,After trying many different medications to treat anxiety and insomnia_ zoloft_ buspar_ hydroxyzine_ klonopin to name a few I had reached a point where nothing was working. (Benzos work well for me_ but my doctor doesn't care to prescribe them often) I had talked to my PCP and asked to try trazodone.  Big mistake. I'm usually a person who can wait out side effects because I know they aren't permanent but the side effects from this medication are some of the worst. The first night i took 50 mg during the day and 100 mg before bed. It did not cause any drowsiness whatsoever. I almost immediately got a pounding headache_ felt extremely dizzy and felt more depressed (slight suicidal idealization) than I have in my life. Once I went to sleep I had continuous nightmares_ and woke up several times to not only go pee_ but to drink water. I would end up drinking about 4 bottles of water in about 25 minutes. I was so thirsty and miserable. However_ once I went back to sleep about 3:30 I didn't wake up until almost 4 pm. No matter how hard I would try to wake up_ I would fall right back asleep. Finally I woke up_ took a shower and felt slightly okay. Still had a headache. The next few times I took it_ I cut my dose down to just 50 mg and it did nothing for my sleep. The dizziness I felt was unreal and never went away. I still feel lightly heavy in the head and I took my dose yesterday at 2 pm. As far as I can tell this medicine has no benefits that are outweighing the bad side effects,F,22,3  days50mg,5/25/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

Around 10pm I took another 50mg tablet. I was absolutely restless in bed tossing and turning. Temperature was screwed up_ kept feeling hotter than usual. Was able to fall asleep for a few hours maybe 3 or 4 until I woke up at 4am. After not being able to fall asleep again I decided I needed to upload my experience. Although this is the first night ive tried it_ I hope it works tomorrow.,M,19,1  days50mg,5/15/2015,Trazodone hcl
35, 5, Insomnia,Can't turn my brain off at night. Barely getting 3rd hrs. Love this med.  Makes me very sleepy in about 20 min. Wake up groggy but two very small cups of coffee wake me right up then feel very energized.  Sleep about 6 hours.. wake up for potty break once but used to wake up every hour.  I think it has helped my nervous bladder. It has made a fantastic difference in getting some quality sleep. You have to give this some time.  Was extremely tired in the beginning but that is much better. I suffer from severe back pain and migraines.  As my neurologist says_ your body cannot heal itself unless you can sleep. No other side effects.  Am on Lyrics also who have makes me forget names but small price to pay for not being in so much pain.,,F,72,6  months50-100 my,5/14/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

Helps me sleep well for 5 to 6 hours_ thinking of including Melatonin to help sleep longer_ however 6 hours is usually enough to get me through the day well. Helps calm speedy thoughts of the day almost immediately at bedtime.

40, 2, Sleeping problems,Gas and severe bloating.,Trazodone has helped me sleep. Before taking this medication I was waking up every hour during the nighttime. Since taking trazodone the first night I woke up once (2 hours after falling asleep). The second and third night I woke up twice. I have tried every over the counter sleep aid and I have yet to find any med that has helped this much. Trazodone is wonderful as far as helping with sleep but the gas and severe bloating (120 lbs and workout daily) cause major problems. Trazodone has caused more bloat than I have ever experienced in my life. Also_ I read a few posts on here about individuals experiencing withdrawal symptoms when stopping this med and that worries me. I am not sure if I am going to continue this medication.,F,28,3  days50 mg,5/8/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

57, 5, Insomnia,It has a definite and very welcome appetite suppressant effect on me. I hope that continues; I know for some people it causes weight gain. It also makes me want to sweeten my coffee a lot less; less than half what I did before I started taking it. In addition it has changed my temperature perceptions; I used to get cold during the day and would turn the thermostat up_ then turn it down at night and turn on two fans. I don't need the fans_ and I keep the temperature the same day and night. The downside is that it makes me  very loopy; I have trouble thinking of words and names_ and my spelling has gotten horrible. I can live with that.,It's helping me get to sleep and wake up at normal times_ something I haven't been able to do for more than a year. It's causing me to lose weight; I have to force myself to eat twice a day so I can take my pills (which need to be taken with food). My life is getting progressively saner. I feel like a new person. I don't think I was depressed or anxious before_ but maybe I was. Anyway_ I'm happier now because of the positive changes.,F,65,4  days50 MG 1X D,12/23/2014EmailHistory,Trazodone hcl
