0, 5, Contraception_ irregular period,Shorter lighter period_ no acne_ breast growth,This pill was wonderful. It cleared up my skin within days of taking it. My periods were shorter and lighter with minimal cramping. My breasts also grew a bit. The only complaint is that I did get a lot of UTIs while on this pill and had never had them before. Don't know if there could be a link. My insurance stopped covering this brand so I have to switch. Hope to find something just as good.,F,18,1  years,3/8/2015,Loryna
