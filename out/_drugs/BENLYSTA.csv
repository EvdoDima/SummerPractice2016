1, 4, Lupus_Stag V membranous nephritis,Have had the first 3 loading doses in 6 weeks followed by one dose per month for 4 months.  Have tolerated it very well with no major side effects.  I do get a little tired after my infusion.  Has imporved my kidney function significantly. The big downside is the cost_ but there are programs available for assistance.  Everyone is different but I highly recommend this treatment!,,F,48,7  months420 1X M,1/3/2014Email,Benlysta
