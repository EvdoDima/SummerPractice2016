1, 4, Pregnancy complications,Skin irritation,Based on reading the majority of the reviews_ I've never experienced any blurry vision_ dry mouth_ etc. Sorry it didn't work out for the others_ but for me it's a miracle. Im diagnosed with HG_ a severe case in a pregnancy_ and out of the 8 medications that I was taking daily_ The patch seemed to work the most. I discontinued the 7 medications and stuck with the patch. However_ I did have one problem..Since Ive been using this for about 6 months now_ my skin behind my ears are very irritated. Looks like someone burned me. It did feel like a burning sensation everytime I put a new one on_ but it's just a side effect_ Its embarrassing to have my hair up_ people tend to think I have a bad skin rash/infection. The color of the skin behind my ear is a reddish-purpleish. I did take it off once to see how it goes_ and I ended up being back in the hospital_ severely vomiting and vomiting up blood. As much as my skin itches a lot and burns_ I just cant take it off. It?s a nightmare everytime I take a trip to the ER. HG is the worst to have during pregnancies.,F,20,6  months10 mg 2X W,7/31/2016,Transderm scop
2, 1, Travel,Wore when traveling to Africa.  Had to keep on pretty much the whole trip because of motion sickness.  Returned home and took the patch off as soon as we landed.  With 24 hours was horrendously sick.  Fatigue_ nausea_ light headed_ anxiety_ super depressed_ depersonalization_ and looking/acting completely drugged.  For 4 days couldn't pull myself off the couch or out of bed.  Day 5 started to see slight improvement with using Dramamine_ zofran_ and Ativan.  Still have a long ways to go to get back to my normal!,,F,35,10  days,7/11/2016Email,Transderm scop
3, 1, Post surgical nausea,Dry mouth blurred vision headache dizzy PVCS itching dilated eyes.,After removing patch worn for 3 days post op had terrible headache nausea Pvcs dilated pupils equilibrium was off dizzy still having issues after 4th day.  Terrible drug!,F,50,3  days,5/31/2016,Transderm scop
4, 2, Post-op nausea and vomiting,Long history of post-op nausea (PONV) here. Excellent care team applied patch about an hour before surgery (along with IV Zofran) to stop the nausea. Really hoped it would help. The dizziness & blurred vision & very dry mouth made me feel worse--dying of thirst. Drank too fast post-op and had some of the worst PONV ever. CRNA said to wear it 3 days; I took it off after about 36 hours; my doctor switched me from oral promethazine (did not stay down) to meltable Zofran_ which was much better. Hope it works better for others.,,F,50,2  days1 mg patch 1X W,5/18/2016Email,Transderm scop

7, 5, Multiple sclerosis symptoms,No side effects were more noticeable then my MS symptoms in general. It helps every day with my constant vertigo_ dizziness_ and my nausea. If the patch stops working after 3 days I need to put on another because my symptoms come back in full force and its unbearable. I have a hard time leaving the house without one that is actively helping to control my symptoms,I really wish there were more studies about the long term effects of regular usage,F,20,90  days1.5mg 1X D,3/17/2016Email,Transderm scop
8, 1, Nausea during anesthesia,Ugh the patch was put on me prior to surgery so I wouldn't get sick from the anesthesia. The next morning I woke up and couldn't see anything up close. It's now 4 days later and I still can't see up close. No one told me that blurred vision was a side effect. This is awful. I had to go back to work. I will never use this again!,,F,37,1  days30,3/12/2016Email,Transderm scop
9, 1, prior to surgery to prevent nausea,Dry mouth_nausea_extreme dizziness_dialated pupils_ blurred vision_ constipation_ trouble urinating the first 24 hrs.,I was directed to put patch on evening before surgery. Upon waking (10 hrs. after applying the patch) I was extremely dizzy and very blurred vision. Couldn't read my phone_ couldn't see paperwork I was signing at the hospital.The Dr. Said I did the right thing removing it. I had all the above symptoms the first 3 days. I'm on day 4 and I'm still very dizzy at times with bouts of nausea and headaches. Im worried how long it's going to take to clear my system. I would advise no one to take this drug_ very unsafe_ I don't know how it's even allowed to be prescribed. Scary stuff!,F,44,1  days1.5 mg,2/8/2016Email,Transderm scop

11, 1, I was trying it out before a trip,I put a patch on in the evening on a Saturday. By Sunday late in the day I began to feel very dizzy.  I kept it on for about another hour or two and couldn't handle the dizzy feeling anymore and took off the patch.  The next day and a half I felt fine.  By that night though I began experiencing dizziness off and on that progressively got worse.  I also have vision issues_ confusion_ headaches_neasua_ trouble with speech_and severe ear pain.  My doctor put me on a steroid_ meclezine_ zofran_ Zyrtec.  Feeling some relieve but not all the way yet.  So this is day 4 of symptoms.  I did this for an up coming trip.  I'm trying to find out how much longer this will last,,F,43,1  days1.5 mg,12/11/2015,Transderm scop
12, 1, 8 day cruise,I used one patch every 72 hours as directed. I experienced extreme dry mouth and drank water constantly during my cruise. The patches really worked for seasickness which troubles me badly_ but from the moment I removed the last patch_ I was deathly ill.  Severe nausea and headache as well as vivid_ disturbing dreams were my reward for a nausea free cruise. The aftermath of the patches lasted longer than the 8 day cruise.  I have been fatigued_ but unable to rest soundly and once awoke to my heart flipping around in my chest like a fish out of water.  I will never request this poison again.,,F,63,8  days 1X D,10/31/2015,Transderm scop
13, 4, to prevent sea sickness,I used this patch to prevent sea sickness while going deep sea fishing and it did keep me from getting sea sick. The only side effect I've had is the eye on the side I wore the patch_ the pupil keeps dialating. The other pupil is normal. It's been one week now since I removed the patch and the one eye is still dialating. Weird!,,F,59,1  days,10/23/2015,Transderm scop
14, 1, Surgery,Should've learned my lesson the first time I used this for surgery as it made me extremely nauseous as soon as I took it off and the nausea lasted for days. I thought this was because I took it off after 24 hours and did not wait the 72 hours as I was instructed. Just had surgery last week and used it again this time following instructions and removing after 72 hours. The side effects were horrible. Headache_ dizziness and nausea also broke out in a horrible rash. Used meclizine to try and lesson the withdrawals I was experiencing. It took a few days and a few doses of activated charcoal to start feeling normal again. Still suffering with this rash though. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone! This drug is toxic and should not be approved for use!,,F,46,1  days30,10/20/2015,Transderm scop
15, 1, vertigo,Unexplainable and weird feeling.  I stayed in bed for 2 days unable to sleep.  My heart was pounding and bp got so high.  I used meclizine 25 for two days which helped.  I told my doctor about the side effects and he laugh at me.  He said the drug is non-addictive.  I can just remove it and that should be it.,I tried Transdem Scop because it works with a friend and my meclizine gets me sleepy.  I'm back with Meclizine and am glad that it helps me when I needed it.,,67,3  days,9/26/2015,Transderm scop
16, 3, Motion sickness on a cruise,It really helped to keep any motion sickness in check during the cruise_ but hours after I removed the patch I REALLY started feeling the negative side effects:  swollen ankles_ dizziness_ heart pounding_ sweating....all to the point that I was thinking about going to the ER. This is the day after I removed the patch and still feel ill due to the side effects. I won't use this medication again.,,F,53,3  days 1X D,7/31/2015,Transderm scop

When I removed the patch I could not get up for two days and after a week am experiencing severe nausea and dizziness.,I wish I would have know about the withdrawal affects after wearing the patch for so many days. I have used the patch many times before for shorter trips and did not experience the withdrawal symptoms.,F,41,10  days1.5 MG,7/28/2015Email,Transderm scop
19, 3, for a cruise,I just got back from a cruise yesterday morning. This patch worked for motion sickness however after I took it off yesterday I instantly had bad dry mouth and confusion. I had felt like I had burned my tongue eating something hot but I couldnt remember what I had eaten (a banana and orange juice) I then began to feel nauseous and was having blurred vision and double vision. I instantly started drinking tons of water thinking that it would flush it out of my system and I took a shower to really wash the area where I had the patch. I totally zoned out in the shower and knew I was there to wash the patch away but could not remember if I had washed it or not. I then laid down and tried to text my friend but I was seeing double vision again almost impossible to text. I actually fell asleep into a deep sleep for a long time. This is not common for me_ I never take naps during the day. Well today i'm on day 2 and was supposed to pick up my husband from the airport but I do not feel confident,I was prescribed to take one patch for 72 hours and then swap it out with a patch on my alternating side. I followed instructions.,F,39,  1X D,7/24/2015Email,Transderm scop

Could not control my thoughts my actions.  This is not a safe drug.  It has been 3 days since I had taken this drug off and nothing helps.  I would rather deal with a vertigo attack than these side effects.  Please do not take this drug it is very unsafe,M,30,1  days,6/30/2015,Transderm scop
22, 1, Vertigo,Extreme dry mouth_ dizziness_ extreme fear_ insomnia_ emotional_ unusual thoughts and behavior_ shaking_ anxiety. I thought I was going crazy.,Please never take this medication. Worst experience of my life. Went to the ER twice doctors in ER did not believe it was side effects of medication. They keep telling me it was the Vertigo and to keep taking the medication. Thank goodness for this website. It's been five days and still having side effects. It come in waves. Sometimes I'm fine and then all of a sudden my heart will start beating fast_ or I get nauseas_ or begin sweating. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG.,F,32,5  days1.5,6/19/2015,Transderm scop
23, 5, Motion sickness,Dry mouth_ thirst_ tiredness_ a little foggy,I've used this 5 or 6 times. Usually on a boat. I do get carsick so on a trip to Asia where we were driving to factories on dirt roads that were windy I wore one. Never felt nassaus. Had a trip 3 days ago that required me to be on a bus_ used the patch and was fine. I evern READ in the backseat of the car!  Dry mouth and tiredness are better than nausea and vomiting. Use correct dose. It's been a game changer for me.,F,44,2  days1 mg 1X W,6/11/2015,Transderm scop
24, 1, 4 day cruise,SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION. I had the patch on for about 24 hours and my hands/wrists were so swollen to about 2-3 times the size. I thought that it was because I was wearing the pressure point wrist bands_ so I ignored it. The next day I could barely swallow. I thought that I just had severe dry mouth_ a common symptom_ however I was really having an allergic reaction! I came home from the cruise_ and within 1 hour of taking off the patch_ I have severe shaking_ could not hold a glass of water. I felt like I was still on the boat with the wooziness_ but way worse. I had to hold onto objects just to walk across the room. I took an allergy pill and within the hour_ my heart palpitations began. High blood pressure_ shaking uncontrollably_ could barely stand up_ felt like I was going to pass out. I ended up in the hospital.,I am thankful that I saw this website because I also thought that I was going crazy. It is now 3 weeks after taking the patch off and I am not the same. I have the worse fatigue I have ever experienced. The first week off the patch I still felt like I was going to pass out_ also with fatigue and shaking and confusion. I would forget what I was talking about or take an extra long time to respond to an email at work. I would have these shaking light headed episodes where I would almost pass out. I ended up missing about 2-3 days of work because of this. All I could do was sleep. I also had spasms in my legs which lasted a few days. The second week was slightly better with less of the shaking light headed episodes. The fatigue was still there however. I am just trying to be patient. Week three and I can't take it. I have not been the same since. I have never experienced this fatigue feeling for this long. I am still having trouble concentrating but it's better than week 2. I am extrememly depressed_ not myself. I have actually gone back to exercising only to be let down by having to stop in the middle of it. The almost fainting episodes have stopped_ thank god. However I am not myself anymore. I really hope that it fades soon. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I really feel that if I did not go to the hospital that I would have passed out and not woke up. I really do. ,F,34,4  days 1X D,6/3/2015EmailHistory,Transderm scop
25, 5, to avoid motion sickness on cruise,During I had the patch I did not experience motion sickness or side effects  but after I took it off_ it was horrible : vomits_ upset stomach_ dizziness. I thought I had a stomach flu.  I finally recovered and could travel back to my home.  It spoiled my vacations for 4 days. DO NOT USE THIS PATCH.,,F,52,3  days30 1X D,5/5/2015,Transderm scop

27, 1, Post anesthesia/surgery,Blurred vision_ dizziness_ weakness_ memory loss_ anxiety that elevated blood pressure_ shakiness_ depression_ headaches_ vivid dreaming_ feeling like I was trapped in my own body!,I had a routine surgery that caused me to become sick after anesthesia. The nurse just put this on me and directed me not to touch it for it could cause my eyes to dilate. I was very careful not to touch it. I returned to work and after I took the patch off. I began having all above symptoms. I called my dr immediately and told me it was the patch. I missed a week of work and I prayed to God that I would recover quickly! This was a VERY SCARY experience and I thank God that I have a wonderful husband and family who helped me! I have 4 children and work a full time job. I was unable to be a mom or work! I had to rely on others to drive me and take care of my children_ while I laid in bed. I am a normally very healthy 32 year old. I do not take medication_ smoke_ or drink alcohol. I would have rather been sick all night than go through the symptoms I experienced from this patch!!!!,F,32,3  days,3/12/2015,Transderm scop
28, 1, post-surgery,About 2 hours after taking the patch off (before I knew any of the stuff on this website) my arms started to feel oddly weak. I didn't feel like I had normal control of my hands. I had blurry vision while on the patch and it got worse after I took it off.  The day I took it off I was unable to eat or drink due to severe nausea.  I was highly emotional which was very unusual for me.  I felt depressed and fatigued. I ended up getting 4 liters of fluid through IV the day after I took the patch off. 3 days after that I ended up with what is called an intractable migraine and only a trip to the ER fixed the issue. Nearly 3 weeks later I am still having vision problems but the other issues have resolved.,Stay far away from this crap.,F,35,2  days 1X O,2/26/2015Email,Transderm scop
29, 1, Seven Day Cruise,"Two and a half months after using the Transderm Scope Patch and I am back to normal!  I struggled the most with Vertigo.  My symptoms were: dry mouth_ itching around patch_ vertigo_ dizzy_ cognitive confusion_ the muscles on one side of my face (the side the patch was located on) would  tense at night when I was tired.  This would cause my face to appear lopsided.  I had loss of near vision_ extreme fatigue. ear pain_ ear popping_ and vomiting when patch was removed.  I also had gut issues and appetite issues.  Women in their mid 40s can develop vertigo (Mal de Debarquement or ""MDD"" a type of vertigo and imbalance that occurs after getting off of a boat.)  The big question_ was my body resetting itself after an allergic reaction to scopolamine in combination with MDD or was it all related to the Transderm Scope patch/scopolamine.  I believe it was all related to the patch_ so did the majority of the doctors I visited.  Either way_ I learned the actual drug is still in your sy",Drink water to flush everything out of your body.  I took Benadryl_ and think it helped a small amount.  Our cruise was very rough seas in  August 2014.  While the patch was on I did not get sick once.  Out of 10 family/friends members on the cruise who took the patch_ five had a reaction.  For you who are suffering now_ I am so sorry.  It was a long road_ but it is over now!  I?m at month three and will now and work to get back into the great physical shape I was in before I had my allergic reaction. Best Wishes.,F,43,4  days 1X D,11/11/2014Email,Transderm scop

33, 1, Motion sickness on trip,I used the patch before and had no issues using it on this trip. I took off patch after plane/car ride home after 2 days with that patch on. I woke up with extreme itching thoughout my body_ then progressed to dizzy feeling. I took benadryl with no help_ got worse went to ER. Told them about trip_ mentioned patch. ER dr told me maybe bug bite or parasite from ocean. Put me on prednisone. Got worse and worse over the next 7 days (another trip to ER_ and 2 trips to walk in clinic). Dizzy_ not myself_ could not think or drive_ shaking_ and heart rate up even after an hour in doctor office. Just told me to go home and drink water_ came off prednisone given antihistamine. Dr took me off everything except antibiotic while waiting for blood work to come back. Doctors said_ have no idea what you came in contact with and did not believe it was from patch (and neither did I and that point).,"Came home in tears on day 7 from doctor as heart rate was still up and dr pretty much told me to ""calm down it will go away"". Thankfully I did not have to go back to work for 2 weeks but was getting nervous about being forced into a medical leave. I went to my computer and searched everything_ places I have been_ bugs_ ocean water....then finally this site and a few others like this! YES!!!! I found it!! I was shocked as I used the patch before but like so many before me_ it happens a lot to people who used it before. It was everything I had! I read about people doing the dramamine. I was so nervous to do it but it was over the counter and told my husband it can't hurt and had taken it before. It was like a MIRACLE. Total turn around. I took 50mg (non drowsy brand only_ reg one has a different drug). I took 25mg every 6 hrs for 12 hours (2 doses)_ then took a 24 hr 50mg dose and slept it off. No more meds_ heart rate down_ dizzy stopped. You will know when to take the next pill as you start feeling it again. If it is at night take 25mg or try to sleep it off. I am still waiting my blood work and when I go back this week_ I plan on getting my records and then telling this dr he needs to read up on this patch! I also plan on writing my hospital to inform their doctors_ did not have to go through those 7 days of extreme discomfort if they understood this withdrawals from this patch.

SEVERE flushing (like a sunburn all over). DRY MOUTH. Just complete_ complete HELL. I would take the nausea over this ANY day. The stupid anesthesiologist didn't even tell me what I got - didn't tell me to take it off if I got urinary retention. It's been a WEEK and I am still needing to use a catheter to drain my bladder. What in the hell are they thinking giving this to people without their knowledge?! POISON POISON POISON. STAY AWAY!!!!,I wore the patch for 2 days before Googling it and realizing it was SCOPOLAMINE. Look up Scopolamine on YouTube. It is a deliriant. If you care about your mind and body_ don't let them TOUCH you with this stuff.,F,23,2  days1 patch 1X D,8/5/2014Email,Transderm scop
37, 5, Prevention of Motion sickness,I used the patch to prevent motion sickness when I went to Disney World and Universal Studios.

40, 1, Preventing post-op nausea,Extreme blurry eyes_ extreme dry mouth and throat,I put this on before surgery at the recommendation of my anesthesiologist.  When I woke up from my surgery_ everything was blurry.  Five hours post-surgery I could not only not read things closely_ but also couldn't see the TV in my hospital room.  I asked the nurse if I could take off the patch_ and she said no.  Well_ by 11pm that night I was nearly blind and pulled off the patch.  For the first week after surgery_ I had severe dizziness and spins.  Meclizine helped that.  However_ my eyesight continued to be poor for 6 weeks.  I finally saw my eye Dr. and she said to wait it out.  Now_ 8 weeks post-surgery_ I feel my eyesight is back to normal.  That was a HORRIBLE experience and I only wore it for 12 hours!  I will turn it down every time in the future.  I would rather throw up a few times.  I wanted to post for those who are worrying that your eyesight will never return to normal.  It does.,F,37,1  daysone patch 1X D,5/2/2014,Transderm scop
41, 2, nausea prevention while at Disney World,I thought I was going blind.  To the point I was scheduling a follow up appointment with my lasik doctor from 8 years ago to see if I needed an additional procedure.  I couldnt read anything_ close or far_ and everything was in doubles and blurry.  When I finally remembered ears and eyes are tied into motion sickness_ I had my husband google the side affects of Transderm Scop to see blurred vision in the #1 spot.  My doctor didnt mention this when pescribing it or I would have stuck with dramamine.  I took it off immediately.  Its 3 days later and my vision is still jacked up.

42, 1, cruise,cotton mouth and blurred vision while on it.  It helped me not get sick on my cruise.,But o man about 2 days after I stopped taking this I couldn't drive to work with out getting so motion sick that I had to go back home.  Confusion and I thought maybe I was going a little crazy_ very scared that it wasn't going to go away_ dizzy spells out of the blue.  Cant focus on my work.  Worse after affects than LSD or any other drug I have ever took and I have took a lot of different drugs.  It has been three weeks and my body and mind are finally starting to feel normal again.  I wore the patch for 10 days changing it every three days behind my right ear.  And when I took it off my salivary glands were swollen and I got a horrible sore throat.  It has been three weeks and I can still feel the after affects a little bit and my sore throat and salivary glands still hurt.  NOT WORTH IT STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG.  SHOULD NOT BE LEGALL!!!!!!!!!,M,30,10  days 1X D,2/9/2014,Transderm scop
43, 1, Cruise,While taking drug very dry mouth_ blurry vision and dilated eyes_ also very little urination. Did not suffer seasickness so I thought it was great. Used 2 patches every third day_ had an itchy feeling around patch.,Exactly 24 hours after taking off patch was when the real issues began. I could not function because of the dizziness_ nausea_ blurry vision and severe fatigue.  Thought it was jet lag and trying to get my land legs back. This is now day six and I have had issues with my balance_ confusion_ my head feeling full_ a floaty feeling_ trouble focusing and reading_ exhaustion_ a rash_ headaches_ nauseated feeling_ sweaty_ and weird dreams.  Also_ my period stopped instantly when I was on the patch and now 10 days later it has started again_ 6 days after taking the patch off.  It's hard to describe to others how I feel...just out of it and my body feeling weird.  What the heck was in that drug that it takes so long to get out of your system? My 13 year old son wore a patch for 2 days and took it off. He says he felt fine while wearing it.I would never use this again.  Will use the wristbands next time.

45, 1, Disney trip,24 hours after taking off patch I had severe nausea and dizziness - lasted for 24 hours. Not sure how common these side effects are as this site seems to report mostly bad side effects. It helped while on vacation to reduce nausea on roller coasters but man did I pay for it afterwards. Also my box didn't tell me to switch ears per 3 day applications which may have made my side effects worse.  I'll just stay off roller coasters_ not worth it for me.,,M,43,9  days 1X O,11/30/2013,Transderm scop
46, 1, Motion Sickness/7-day Cruise,Blurred vision_ Parkinson-like tremors_ moderate confusion_ short-term memory loss_ nausea,Twenty-three years ago I underwent back surgery and was given Scopolamine to treat the nausea and vomiting which I had post-operatively. I developed hallucinations_ a very frightening experience_ and the Scopolamine had to be discontinued. Despite that experience_ being a long-time sufferer of motion sickness_ I  decided to try the Transderm Scop Patch when I was going on my first cruise 4 years ago.  It worked very well for me at that time. A few weeks ago_ my husband and I were going on our 2nd cruise_ and this time_ the experience was totally different.  Although it seemed to control the motion sickness for the first 6 days of the cruise_ blurred vision_ tremors_ and moderate confusion occurred from about day 2 on_ although at the time I did not connect these symptoms with the patch and thought perhaps they were related simply to being on the sea.  On day 6_ after replacing the 2nd patch with the 3rd to cover my final day on board_ I became seriously nauseous.  We disembarked the next day_ and I felt moderately nauseous during our 2 days on land and our 10 hour plane trip home.  But the next day_ when I was settled back at home_ I became significantly nauseous which has caused me to be non-functional for a week now.  I feel OK when in a prone position but become nauseous when I stand and move around in any way and fall asleep very readily. I would never use this medication every again and would strongly discourage others from doing so.,F,67,7  days 1X O,11/4/2013,Transderm scop

51, 1, Cruise,No motion sickness at all during cruise.  Dry mouth_ red dry eyes_ inability to sweat when working out were my only side effects on ship.  1 hour after removing patch- blurred vision_ nausea_ one dilated pupil.,24 hours later after removing patch I felt worse.  Felt like I was coming down with a stomach bug.  Felt very dizzy_ blurred vision_ no appetite_ heart racing_ headache.  I started searching on line about my symptoms and so glad I came across this site.  I was starting to think I was going crazy!  I am now on my 6th day of feeling like this.  Vision is getting better but dizziness_ anxiety and fast heart rate are the same.  I cannot believe that these side effects are not more known by medical professionals.  The only thing I was told was that my mouth would get dry.  I would never have used this patch if I knew about these withdrawal symptoms!  I just wish I knew how long I'd feel this way. Very unpleasant.  NEVER USING AGAIN!!,F,34,7  days1.5 mg 3X W,7/18/2013Email,Transderm scop
52, 1, Motion sickness,I went on vacation with my family when I was 13_ they gave me the patch twice in two days.

I am now 39 and can still remember verbatim the two day trip!!!,,M,13,2  days10 mg,7/14/2013Email,Transderm scop
53, 1, Anti nausea for surgery,This was the worst drug experience I have ever had in my life. I did not know what was wrong with me for the first 2 days after I had returned home from a surgery.They gave me the patch to help with Nausea. I first started feeling dizzy and disoriented and then the anxiety started. I could not walk and my heart was pounding. I have done my share of drugs and I will tell you right now this was the worst and most scary experience I have ever had. I thought I had permanently lost my mind. I spent all night awake and hyperventilating.I thought I was having a heart attack. I tried other things to calm me down but nothing helped. I am lucky my boyfriend took care of me. It lasted about 4 days and the worst 2 days where in the middle. I will never take this drug again. The doctors did not believe me when I called and told them what was happening and that made me even more scared until my boyfriend found this site and read the review.  at least then I knew I wasn't going mental.,Stay Away from this drug,F,26,2  dayspatch 1X D,6/11/2013,Transderm scop

Felt bad all day on Saturday_ but oh my Sunday morning all hell broke loose_ 24 hours after removing the patch my symptoms were heightened.  My husband took me to the urgent care center_ all they did was tell me to drink lots of water to try and flush the drug out of my system.   Its day 5 now and I'm still having issues with dizziness_ weakness and fatigue.  Hoping to be back to at least the original state I was in before takign this drug soon.,F,47,1  times1.5 1X D,6/6/2013,Transderm scop
55, 5, Vertigo,No side effects,Only thing that stopped my vertigo_ nausea_ and vomiting that lasted for four weeks before I got it.  Within 30 minutes of having one on_ my vertigo stopped.  Hasn't been back since.  Highly recommend this for anyone with vertigo.  Be careful and wash your hands after handling.  This is a strong sympathetic system medicine.,F,34,21  days30 mg 1X D,5/4/2013Email,Transderm scop
56, 1, I had minor surgery.,When removing the patch within an hour or so I was disoriented. Felt like I was in a dream. I then became confused and kept repeating myself. I had to have my husband come to my work and take me home. I slept all night but woke up with the same side effects literally no memory_ very scared and confused. Husband took me to the ER. They did cat scan and blood work and told me to drink lots of fluids. Doctors didn't seem to know about drug effects. I became worse within a few days. Finally got to the point where I was studdering and couldn't remember anything. I became catatonic and couldn't speak at all when I was finally rushed again to the ER. I was placed in ICU for 24 hours and had testing for a stroke. I also had vomiting_ high blood pressure and fast heart rate. MRI_ and every other test said no stroke. reaction to the patch. I then spend another two days in a regular room getting my speech back and my anxiety level down.,THIS DRUG SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET! Even if some tolerate it well its not worth it to have it out there where it can cause so much havoc for those that do not tolerate it well. I was not given any side effect information besides_ dry mouth and blurred vision. Surgery center just placed it on me. THIS DRUG COME FROM A PLANT IN COLUMBIA THAT IS USED FOR TRUTH SERUM AS WELL AS CRIMINALS TO DIBILIATE THE VICTIM WHERE THEY DO NOT HAVE A MEMORY OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. THIS DRUG IS CALLED DEVILS BREATH IN COLUMBIA. I have went through two weeks of hell after having this patch. I thought that I was not going to live through it all.  It has now cost my husband and I thousands in medical bills because of my SERIOUS reaction. Please call the FDA and the pharmaceutical reps in your area as well as the makers of this drug. If enough people do maybe it will be taken off the market. 10 DAYS OUT AND STILL WORKING ON GETTING MYSELF 100% BETTER! STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG.,F,44,2  daysunsure 1X D,4/29/2013Email,Transderm scop
57, 1, 7 day cruise,This drug is poison. I have used the patches on 3 previous cruises and thought this medication was wonderful. This time_ I was terribly wrong. During the cruise the only problem I experienced was blurry vision_ which I expected because it was listed as a side effect. 12 hours after I removed the patch_ all hell broke loose. I was naseauted_ dizzy_ felt like my movement was delayed by 3 seconds_ anxious_ depressed_ tired_ was twitching and confused. I couldn't focus and was crying all the time. It has been 4.5 days since I have had that evil patch on_ and I still do not feel back to normal. This drug is HORRIBLE and STAY FAR AWAY from it.,,F,24,7  days,4/4/2013Email,Transderm scop

59, 1, To avoid Nausea after surger,15 minutes into wearing the patch my heart start thumping wildly and then racing_ thumping and racing...beating hard_ then I noticed my throat scratchy and dry.  I could not think clearly.  My face was on fire and when looked into the mirror my cheeks were flushed. Diarrhea the next day.,15 minutes into wearing the patch my heart start thumping wildly and then racing_ thumping and racing...beating hard_ then I noticed my throat scratchy and dry.  I could not think clearly.  My face was on fire and when looked into the mirror my cheeks were flushed. I thought hmmm I better look at side effects and so when I did I ripped that patch off immediately.  I had placed it on at bedtime as I was to have surgery the next morning...as a result surgery was cancelled due to my condition from the patch...I had felt GREAT all day long before I placed that patch on...unbelievable...for me it was a HORRIBLE experience. I had diarrhea that next day into the next night...I didn't get any sleep that entire night after I ripped the patch off.  If you have ever had an allergic reaction to any other substance DO NOT USE THIS PATCH.,F,56,1  days 1X D,1/24/2013Email,Transderm scop
