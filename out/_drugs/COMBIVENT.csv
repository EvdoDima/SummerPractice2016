0, 4, Pneumonia suspected COPD,Massive coughing fit that started during inhalation and carried on for 10 - 15 minutes afterward. My mouth and tongue were somewhat numb.,The doctor prescribed this combination as salbuterol on its own had no measurable effect. The coughing after the combination was highly productive and once the fit had died away_ the wheezing that brought me into hospital initially has been under much better control. It's a fairly harsh experience though!,M,50,1  weeks,12/26/2014,Combivent
1, 4, Bronchitis,Week limbs_ increased hunger_ coughed directly after use,,F,16,4  weeks,4/11/2012,Combivent
2, 4, Asthma,Cough after using_ but that is more a productive effect than a side effect.,I use this with Maxair when my asthma is severe and it works well for me. It makes me cough right away and begin to clear the cottony mucus that comes with asthma out of my airways. Less heart racing than with albuterol.,M,53,6  years1-2 puffs 1X AN,12/7/2010,Combivent
3, 5, Asthma,None that I am aware of.,This works better for me than the regular Albuterol inhalers_ like Proventil_ ProAir etc. It has albuterol in it but also has Ipratopium Bromide.  This combination seems to be more effective to open my airways during an acute attack.  This is mainly a COPD medicine_ but it is being more widely prescribed for asthma because for many it is more effective.  It acts much more quickly for me than Albuterol inhalers alone do. I can also use it up to six times a day_ but Usually once or twice is enough.,M,53,2  years1-2 sprays 4X D,10/19/2010,Combivent
4, 2, emphysema and asthma,I could not inhale the drug without violent coughing. It did open the airways incredibly but within a few hours I got very painful joints [knees and arm bones] Pain bad enough to prevent sleeping. This pain would go within 24 hours of stopping the combivent.,It was wonderful for opening the airways after the initial bronchospasm on taking but the pain in the muscles and bones of arms and legs was unbearable.,F,70,7  days,5/22/2009,Combivent
5, 2, emphysema,It was very tough to take this med because even with a spacer it made me cough every time I tried to take it.  Had more success with Atrovent taken separately or nebulized DuoNeb.,Spiriva works much better for me than Combivent ever did & it NEVER makes me cough.  Never could figure out why Combivent made me cough & Atrovent even via MDI didn't make me cough nearly as badly.,F,50,10  times,7/10/2007,Combivent
6, 4, son was taking for Asthma/pneumonia,coughing_ but nothing out of the ordinary. Coughing may have been from Pneumonia. It seemed to do the trick slighty.,It seemed to work_ but I am unsure. He was in the red or low yellow zone on his peak flow meter_ this medication allowed him to get to the high yellow zone. May have been the medication_ or he was just getting better.,M,9,7  days,1/17/2007,Combivent

11, 2, ,Throughout taking this inhaler medication I noticed that it irritates the throat and causes a severe coughing fit with each use.  I had better results with the use of plain albuterol_ however_ my M.D. suggested I try combivent.  I am definitely dissatisfied with the results.,,F,25,1.5  months,7/7/2004,Combivent
