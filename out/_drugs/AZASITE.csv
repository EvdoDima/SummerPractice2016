0, 3, ,Terrible headaches,I was using this off-label to treat my dry eyes.  Because of the expense and concerns about long term use_ I did not use Azasite often. In 2010_ I went through three_ three week courses_ and it was wonderful.  My eyes were comfortable_ and the little bumps in my eyelid went away.  However_ in 2015 and 2016_ I tried the medication again_ and it gave me unbearable headaches both times.  I don't know if I have become allergic or sensitive to something in the drops_ or whether the new owner of the patent somehow changed the formula and added something that was not there in 2010.  At any rate_ I cannot use them any more.,F,54,  2X D,3/5/2016,Azasite
