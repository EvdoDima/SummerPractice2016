0, 3, Birth Control,"No weight gain_ maybe even slight 1-2lbs) weight loss.i did have strange cramps in my toes and feet that I never had before. Definite increased anxiety. I am switching to Generess FE because I think Safyral has been causing my hair to shed over time. It also changed the texture from thick and slightly wavy to pin needle straight.  But_ I did not get pregnant. I am 43 years old _ very active_ 5'5"" 125lbs. and stayed that way on this pill.",,F,43,3  years 1X D,8/6/2014,Safyral
1, 3, Prevent pregnancy,estrogen dominance_ hair loss_ fatigue_ cravings_ bloating,The only thing I liked about this BCP is cleared up my acne_ and no breakthrough bleeding or unplanned pregnancies. I hated losing my hair more and more over the 10 months while on it! I also hated the lack of sex drive_ intense carb cravings and fatigue I experienced toward the middle-end of each pack. I will be switching back to LoEstrin FE next month because the side affects are becoming worse with time.,F,26,10  months 1X D,7/17/2012Email,Safyral
