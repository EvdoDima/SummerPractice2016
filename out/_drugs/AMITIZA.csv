0, 2, Bowel resection / non working colon,I have had bloating_ extreme dizziness to where it's affecting my everyday life! Have had to go to the ER already was taking with Relistor shot as well every other day.

1, 4, Constipation,None,Stopped taking because of its expense.  Now_ every morning I mix one teaspoon of baking soda in 12 ounces of water and add the juice of 1/2 of a fresh lemon. At night take one 1_000 olive oil extract pill to keep insides hydrated.  This combination works just as well as Amitiza and it only costs pennies compared to $4 a pill for Amitiza.,F,59,2  years24 2X D,5/11/2016,Amitiza
2, 3, OIC,Severe bloating_ distention_ and super dry mouth. Occasianal nasea_ but that could be from other meds. When you take 4 or 5 meds_ it's hard to figure out which is causing what.

5, 3, medication-related constipation,Chest tightness_ mental fogginess_ fatigue,"In 45 days I've had three spontaneous BMs. I continue to experiment with additional measures_ based on MD recommendations. Currently I also take 2 to 4 magnesium tablets/day; 3 stool softeners; 5 soluble fiber capsules with lots of water; 2 sennas (at night); and use 1 or 2 suppositories. I've had only 1  spontaneous BM in 45 days that was ""enough_"" so I used a suppository even after the other 2_ producing an equal amount on the 2nd try. I'm highly motivated_ as the medication that produces constipation gave me a large+small bowel impaction this summer_ which turned into an obstruction_ and I had to take Supraprep via nasogastric tube in the ER to clear it. I'm disappointed that Amitiza isn't very effective_ and worried about my quality of life if I keep being unable to concentrate very well.

7, 5, Unknown severe constipation,I started taking 24mg once as day but gave me severe nausea and almost like a was gonna pass out I had to sit crouched over in the floor for about an hour and a half to two hours it did this twice so I stopped taking it and called my doctor_ he said try 1 every other day_ so I did but it did the same thing. I called back and he said to stop taking it and started me out on 8 mg. even with the first dose I have a bowl large by everyday.  I have to take it on a full stomach it just makes me gassy if I take it on an empty stomach it makes me severely nauseas.,I know take 8mg a day on a full stomach doesn't matter if it's in the afternoon or at night.  I went from no bm for 7 days at a time_ tried linzess_ miralax_ stool softners_ laxatives_ and none of them worked.  Amitiza so far is the only thing that helps.  I have daily bms now no more stomach swelling and most of all no more constipation!!,F,24,1  months8mg 1xd,4/29/2015,Amitiza

10, 3, Gluten intolerant_chronic constip.,occasional shortness of breath_ achy joints_ bloated feeling_ diarrhea_ occasional headache,When I first started taking amitiza it would make me bloated and full feeling. Sometimes I would have a bowel movement_ sometimes not. If I did not it was a pretty uncomfortable feeling most of the day. I did have the shortness of breath a few times. I was taking it twice a day as recommended. It was brutal in the beginning. I was desperate though_ from the discomfort of the constipation. I started reading about how the medicine worked and started my own trial and error of the best way to take a dose. I stopped the twice a day for one because it made me feel terrible all day and evening. Eventually I stopped taking it with food early in the morning_ and would take it with a cup of coffee. In 1-4 hours I would have a bowel movement. It was usually just diarrhea_ but it relieved my constipation_ and I generally felt better. I have been taking it off and on for several years now_ and I know this; if I take it on an empty stomach_ it works better. I drink a bottle of water and generally a cup or two of coffee. It's difficult to have to wait around in the morning for a bowel movement_ especially when it comes on the way this medicine brings it on. What I have begun to do now is set my alarm and take the medicine about 2 hours before I get up in the morning. It seems to work. I get up_ and within and hour I'm going to the restroom generally. I try to eat pretty quickly_ and it usually makes my stomach feel achy for a little while after_ but it's much better than feeling aweful for,M,38,4  years24mcg 1X D,1/15/2015Email,Amitiza

12, 2, Chronic constipation,I developed an infrequent dry cough on Amitiza and it hadn't started working afte 2 weeks so I stopped using it.,I had been constipated for about 10 years_ since moving to Florida.  One day I saw rust stains in my toilet after returning from vacation and realized there was a lot of iron in my water.  I know iron can be constipating_ so I added a type of salt to my water-softener that takes the rust out.  Since then I am no longer constipated. Perhaps doctors should ask about iron in water before prescribing Amitiza!,F,61,2  weeks24 mcg 1X D,7/29/2014,Amitiza

17, 4, Chronic Constipation,A little fatigue and bloating,"I started with the 24mcg 2xs per day and had nausea_ headaches_ abdominal pain_ fatigue and mental fogginess. I read that there is an ""adjustment period"" so I stayed with the program and started to have BMs daily. I very gradually decreased the dosage over time and still get the same benefits with much reduced side effects. I only take one of the small pills per day now_ but I still have a little bloating and fatigue_ but significantly less than I had with larger dosages and without any medication at all. This medication works for me. I can't give it a 5 rating because I still deal with side effects_ although they are minor.",F,49,7  months8mcg 1X D,3/12/2013,Amitiza

26, 1, IBS-C,stomach muscles spasms (left side)_ sudden onset of painful gas_ joint pain (knee),When I first started taking Amitiza_ it worked really well. I was taking the 8 mg pills once a day even though the directions said to take it twice daily. This was for about a 2 week period. I was having bowel movements about twice a day and felt great. After prolonged use_ I found that it did not work for me. I started to experience muscle spasms on the left side of my stomach_ which I have not experienced before taking the pill. Although they are not too painful_ it is an odd sensation. Going into the 2nd month_ the pill seemed to have lost its effectiveness as I wasn't having regular daily bowel movements like I used to when I first started. Bowel movements were starting to get irregular and I would have movements every other day. I was off the pill for a while and started up again and increased my dosage to two times a day. This had a negative effect as I would have sudden onsets of painful gas which was  embarassing while at work. I have been off Amitiza for 2 months and have decided to go the natural route: reduce stress_ improve diet_ regular exercise_ LOTS of water_ and fiber supplements. I have found the exercise has improved my IBS-C as well as reducing stress. The fiber supplements don't really help but I am unsure if I am using them properly (not drinking enough water). Although I still experience bloating_ constipation_ and gas_ it is not as bad as it used to be and is probably due to not following a healthy diet. And the painful gas has lessened.

28, 5, IBS-C ( spastic colon,When i started taking this medication on August 24th 2009_ i was a bit hesitant because nothing else had worked.  Anyway i started taking 2 pills a day 8mcg. The NAUSEA was almost debilitating! And_ no bowel movements. So i had to wear the Nausea Patch behind my ear which cause MAJOR BLURRINESS and i couldnt focus to read. But_ after about a week i actually started having bowel movements which was a blessing! i started having stomach/abdominal issues after i had my gallbladdere removed in 2000. anyway.. so after about a month into the medication which i contemplated stopping several times because i could hardly stand the nausea. im so pleased with it! A MIRACLE!. Now my insurance is starting up saying that i need to try this or that first and im like ive tried everything under the sun and this is the only thing that helps.. what a croc of crap!
