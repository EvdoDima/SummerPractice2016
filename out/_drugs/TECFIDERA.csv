0, 3, MS (off label Psoriasis),Flushing_ stomach upset_ dry mouth.,This is not medical advice_ this is only my experience.  Consult a Doctor prior to trying these remedies.  To combat the flushing_ I would take two low-dose aspirin about an hour before dose.  For flushing and stomach upset_ I would also try to take it with a meal - at the very least_ a full fat greek yogurt_ full fat cheese_ etc.  Protein and fat helped.  Nothing helped the dry mouth_ and apparently it's not a recorded side effect (although it's the only reason I had dry mouth).  Tec nearly cleared my severe Plaque Psoriasis (and made me a happy girl)_ but after several months Tec did nothing for the MS_ having new lesions and/or enhancing lesions on each MRI.  Side effects were bothersome and required a bit of planning_ but because I had great results with the psoriasis_ I tolerated it longer than I would have if I did not have psoriasis.,F,34,10  months 2X D,5/6/2016Email,Tecfidera
1, 5, Multiple Sclerosis,Initial nausea_ stomach cramps and flushing. The stomach issues were so bad that I nearly abandoned it after a week but then it slowly started to subside. The flushing still occurs occasionally and I do still take the tablets with food just in case.,Try avoiding fruit and other acidic foods when first starting on the tablets. I found that a big breakfast helped with the first tablet of the day. I also found that keeping my stomach full helped so constantly eating snacks was how things first started but definitely got better after a month or two.,F,26,18  months240 2X D,1/10/2016Email,Tecfidera

3, 3, MS scars,I am exhausted all the time. I have bad nausea as well. I was told to take the meds with a Fat_ Carb_ and Protein each time  10 minutes or more before taking the pill. That's making me feel full all the time_ and tired. I only weigh 125 pounds. I shouldn't be this tired! We will see if it helps with my next MRI. The nausea and tiredness must go away!!!,,F,45,60  days240 2X D,5/13/2015Email,Tecfidera
4, 5, Relapsing MS,Initially_ flushing and gastrointestinal   Taking with food definitely helped. After 4-6 weeks the side effects started to reduce.  Now they are rare but I still take with food Just had my first MRI and things looked good. Have had no relapses (but didn't on Avonex either which I was taking before).  I like the independence of tecfidera over the Avonex shots. I just couldn't do it i had to drive over to my mother in law and have her perform the injections.   It is nice to feel in control of my therapy.,,F,50,9  months240 mg,9/5/2014Email,Tecfidera
5, 5, RRMS,Terrible fatigue_ flushing_ nausea for about 6 weeks. Then_ only flushing and occasional mild nausea for 15-30 minutes a few hours after each dose. It has been SO worth it! No relapses_ MRI improvement and lesion healing :) Overall I feel pretty good considering_ and I do not miss shots every day either.,,F,38,8  months 2X D,6/3/2014Email,Tecfidera
