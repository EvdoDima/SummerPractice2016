0, 4, reduce LDL/increase HDL,Rarely will get a warm tingling feeling about 4 hours after ingestion but usually stops after 30 mintes.  Appears to be the flushing effect of niacin..,My cardiologist suggested this medication to reduce LDL and increase HDL.   It has worked for the LDL_ reducing it from 125 to 90 mg/dl.  The HDL has stayed the same at 45 mg/dl.  Also this drug is not on my insurance formulary_ so not sure if I need it_ A normal statin alone might do the same thing_ and be a whole lot cheaper.,M,70,7  months500/20 1X D,4/20/2012,Simcor
