4, 3, Misdiagnosed bipolar,Gained thirty pounds,It's good short term (3-6 months) until a proper longer term plan is developed.  It's been described as a 'dirty drug' because it affects so many neurotransmitters.  Should only be used with psychosis.  The benefits of this drug would only outweigh the most extreme cases of mental illness_ I believe.,F,39,1  years150,6/25/2016,Seroquel
5, 1," What my doctor calls ""hypomania.""",I HATE the way this stuff makes me feel. It's terrible. It makes me feel groggy and drowsy_ but it doesn't help me sleep. It makes my restless leg syndrome worse_ just like antihistamines do. I also feel sick_ kind of like a bad hangover. There's also kind of a jitteriness in the way I feel. It's like my muscles have been sedated but my nervous system hasn't. There's just as much anxiety as before taking the drug_ but you feel so groggy and letharic that you can't do anything to ease the jitters. This is a terrible drug. My doctor prescribed it for a condition she calls hypomania_ but after taking just half of a 50 mg pill I can tell that this is not what I need. The grogginess and lethargy might be okay if the drug actually helped me sleep_ but it doesn't. It's like it both sedates and excites my nervous system at the same time_ so my body and my mind are confused as hell. I couldn't wait for the effects of that 1/2 pill to wear off.,My doctor said that she has had patients who take a 600 mg dose of this drug. I think 600 mg would kill me_ seriously. The effect from just 25 mgs was almost too much for me to bear. If you decide to try this drug_ be very careful. Better yet_ don't take it.,M,48,1  days25  mg,6/24/2016Email,Seroquel

I was told that I could never get off of this stuff_ but 16 months ago_ I quit cold turkey. Weening off was not an option for me_ as it made me feel more anxiety_ and more 'crazy'.  I went through 3 months of withdrawal from taking seroquel. I would never recommend that anyone take it..ever.

Fatigue_ lethargy & apathy.,I have been on this medication for around 15 years now. I have tried going off it many_ many times. I even slowly tapered it down to 6.5 mg_ but always ended up back on it because without it - I wouldn't sleep at all for days_ until I would usually start hallucinating and feeling like I was coming apart at the seams. Nothing else seems to work for my insomnia. I am fed up with constantly feeling tired all day and am sick of being so overweight. I went cold turkey 7 nights ago & have only managed 8 hours of sleep TOTAL since. I'm exhausted_ but OK mentally_ in part thanks to being on Prozac & in part to being so determined to get off of it for once and for all.

24, 3, Insomnia,"First few days I slept extremely well. But I went through a long weekend (3 days) unaware of time or place and avoiding social contact unconsciously.  The effect was very strong_ a zombie like effect.  Forgot to exercise_ ate a lot of ice cream_ both bad for me.  Especially bad since I have high TG anyway and should stay away from carbs.  Somehow it seemed not to matter if I ate a tub of ice cream a day.  Nothing mattered.  I tried to take it only some days_ but then couldn't sleep.  In the end I went back to just not sleeping at night.  I sleep during the day_ have an evening job which is ""morning"" for my body.  Hey whatever_ I learned to adjust.",Lots of people are saying headache.  I think I understand why.  I have migraines and they are affected most by my blood pressure which needs to stay low.  Somehow this was pushing my blood pressure up_ giving me a constant headache and tinnitus.  It did have some great side effects like_ my gut calmed down and stopped constipating by being uptight.

I was 105 lbs when I started taking this and was up to 120lbs in just 3 months. My hunger would not cease. Round the clock I was so hungry. It was terrible. I'm not sure if it worked for my bipolar as I only took it for 3 months_ but it wasn't worth it. The withdrawal symptoms were hell. Not as hellish as Effexor withdrawal but really bad.

Now I am paranoid and not sure the medication has done anything to slow or stop the paranoia.    I think my doctor is experimenting on me.  Has me on klonopin_ Seroquel_ Temazepam. Now she has added additional 200 mg of Seroquel during the day.  Only in the morning for a short time can I seem to think a little of my own thoughts in the fog of Seroquel hangover.  I read somewhere these are brain disabling drugs_ a chemical lobotomy in a pill form.  I hope this is not permanent but the strange part is I don't seem to care anymore if it is.

Trial 10 MG a night I cut these nasty pills in half_ 3 weeks into it as I figured I woke up after 20 hours of sleep felt like I was in a coma. Sore joints_ legs hurt to walk_ severe abdominal problems_ black hard stools_ when I can because my stomach is so painful I feel horrible. Days go by different things I notice on just that small amount. Now I am certain the peptic ulcer I had @ in. My 20s_ is back and perferated_ Bleeding. This needs to be dicontinued it will kill you.,F,46,1  days10 mg,5/18/2015Email,Seroquel
55, 5, Bipolar,I am on XR and 25 mg 3x a day of regular seroquel.  Since October_ I have had excruciating_ non stop pain in both hands and feet.  Has anyone had pain with this med.?,This was the only medication my doctor has increased/decreased in the past year.  Doctors can't figure out my pain.  Please let me know if you have had pain on this medication.,F,43,2  years150,5/15/2015Email,Seroquel
56, 5, Unable to sleep,"Every now and then it is like I have taken a sugar pill. I joke that for every bottle they put 5 or 6 sugar pills in just for fun. I have to take Restoril with it or I don't fall all the way asleep. It's like I am asleep sort of but I can remember all of my dreams and I kind of turn into a movie director.  I finally got to the point where if this continued on for too long I could say in my dream ""ENOUGH.""  I had to think about it and tell myself this is what I was going to do for several weeks before my brain remembered to to say that while I was in that state. As long as I take the Restoril with it I actually fall asleep and have at least at short period of time where I am completely ""unaware.""",Something happened to me 9 years ago where I can't fall asleep on my own. I also probably had a nervous break down at the same time. The dr never really knew what happened to me. Before that I never had any problem sleeping. I don't know what I would do without Seroquel. Probably go crazy. I am very grateful to have it. I will say this. I am off all medication for depression an anxiety.  I take a calcium/magnesium supplement and it takes the edge off and actually works better than the Zoloft of Wellbutrin that I took. When I was taking the Zoloft I had what they call vivid dreams. It was worse than what I described above.  I've read about people who try to have vivid dreams. I think they are nuts.  I also sweated a lot at night. Once I was finally off the Zoloft the night sweating and vivid dreams went away. Just saying that to say I knew then it wasn't the Seruquel doing it. If anyone has questions about the use of the Restoril along with the Seroquel you may email me.,F,44,9  years200 mg,5/14/2015Email,Seroquel
57, 1, Bipolar Disorder,Seroquel can cause tardive dyskinesia. I was diagnosed with it at 19. It's an unbearable_ potentially permanent and disfiguring neurological disorder that destroys lives. I do not recommend it.,,F,19,2  years500 MG,5/9/2015Email,Seroquel
58, 3, Panic Disorder_ GAD_ Depression,The morning after taking:- Very sore throat- Severe night sweats- Croaky cough- Difficulty swallowing- Burning/watering eyes- Chest tightness/wheeziness- Upper body and back stiffness and pain,Fairly fast acting as far as having a sedative/anxiolytic effect. Did not have issues when taking this medication at 15 years of age. However_ the side effects may be a polypharmacy issue as I am now also on desvenlafaxine 250mg_ clonidine 100mcg_ modafinil 300mg and orphenadrine. Also have a history of sensitivity to most medications.,F,23,2  days25mg 1X D,4/24/2015,Seroquel
59, 1, Afghan\veteran,Became Diabetic\lost half eye sight_ Damn drug pushing pysch doctors.
