0, 5, Status Migrainosus,None that I am aware of at this time.,I was suffering from severe migraines that lasted for months due to a head injury I received in an automobile accident.  I was in severe pain and I had never had a severe migraine before_ I had no idea how terribly awful they can be and I was put on a strong opioid to help me_ which barely scratched the surface in relieving the pain when it was moderate and did nothing for the severe pain.  My first neurologist suspected tension headaches_ he was clearly not listening to me because I could not be in any light for several days at a time_ no one could touch me_ even gently_ without increasing the pain and even sounds made outside my home would also increase the pain terribly.  My new neurologist informed me that I was suffering from ongoing migraines and prescribed this medicine that changed my life.  I am very grateful to her and this drug for helping me.  It either eradicates the pain or greatly reduces it.  I highly recommend trying this drug to help manage migraines.  I took it every day for a week_ but my neurologist said not to take the recommended dosage (two in a 24 hour period_ the first only at signs of a severe headache and the second two hours after the first only if headache has not gone away) more than 3 days a week.  She said using it more may trigger rebound headaches_ so make sure you speak to your doctor about frequency of usage.,F,33, 100mg 2X AN,12/18/2010,Sumatriptan succinate
