9, 1, I HAD A VAGINAL YEAST INFECTION.,I USED THIS CREAM IN CONJUNCTION WITH DIFLUCAN. I HAD A TERRIBLE BURNING SENSATION EACH TIME I USED IT. I GOT WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER. I FINALLY DECIDED IT WAS THE CREAM. I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED USING IT AND GOT RELIEF FROM THE SWELLING AND BURNING. I RESORTED TO USING PLAIN VASELINE TO EASE THE PAIN. THE DIFLUCAN ALONG WITH THE VASELINE FINALLY CURED MY PROBLEM. I HAVE ALMOST THE ENTIRE TUBE OF CREAM LEFT AND WILL NEVER USE AGAIN. I WAS THEN PRESCRIBED MICONAZOLE NITRATE_ BUT AM AFRAID TO USE IT BECAUSE I ANTICIPATE THE SAME RESULTS. ANY SUGGESTIONS?,,F,60,2  days60 GRAMS 2X D,7/23/2011Email,Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide
10, 5, itchy fungal infection,none,I use this cream under my breast at the lowest edge of my bra. I think if I didn't have to wear an underwire bra I might not have the problem. It was prescribed about 5 years ago and I only have to use it for a day or two_ about every other week. The rash occurs mostly in summer or if I'm dressed very warmly in order to keep my heating bill down in winter. I see that many comments mention vaginal infections; they can be caused by oral sex. Don't see that very often in advice columns_ but it's true.,F,65,5  years60 mg 2X D,2/17/2011,Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide

14, 1, vaginal & gastrointestinal yeast,"Severe burning and pain on vaginal area tissue.  I discontinued use after 3rd application and got a prescription for something my doctor said was milder: clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream.  Still burning but less so.  Taken in conjunction with diflucan which was extremely beneficial.  I stopped using the prescription topical creams--too irritating.  As a topical I am using ""Yeast Rescue: a topical herbal solution in olive oil.  I find it very soothing and not irritating_ also very moisturizing.",,F,55, ,11/28/2009,Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide
15, 2, Vaginal candidiasis,Once you use this cream_ you never get rid of the smell! I am swollen more than I was before I began using it_ also.,I have had bouts with vaginal yeast for years_ but have had no flare ups in years. I had an actual culture done_ and the report stated that it was a non-albicans type of yeast. The usual meds did not work at all_ and that goes for the prescript creams_ also.I woke up a few days_ and there it was.....swelling_ intense itching_ burning. I called my doctor to have him order what finally did work several years ago_ but instead_ he gave me Nystatin cream and 3 xtra strong Diflucan. I have used this cream since 2 days ago_ and I have yet to feel any relief. There are times when I think the infection is getting better_ but then I have a horrible itching_ burning attack.The meds I had used several years ago are called Ketoconazole cream and pills. When I compare where I'm at right now with this Nyastatin cream to where I was at the same time when taking the Ketoconazol cream_ there's no competition! Give me the Keto cream anyday.,F,53,3  days,8/22/2009,Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide

18, 5, vaginal itching,23 years ago my gynecologist prescribed this cream and until this year the prescription was filled with a product from Alpharma (purple & white tube). It was magic -- immediate relief. My prescription is now filled with a product manufactured by E. Fougera (yellow & white tube).

I used it morning and evening and there was a huge difference between when I forgot it and when I didn't.,F,19,5  days,9/29/2006,Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide
24, 5, skin fungal infection,No side effects that I'm aware of.  I do find I need the cream more often however.,I have used nystatin/triamcinolone_ the cream_ many times in my life to get relief from the itching and spreadable infection that occurs at the back of my neck just above the end of my hair line.  I have used it at different times in my life_ usually during dry winter months_ but not every year.  I was perscribed many other Rx creams that didn't work and had to specifically ask my doctor for this one (which a doctor when I was a child had percribed).  I was never told it was a steriod drug_ however_ until I visited the pharmacy to pick up a new tube this year.  I was also informed to use it sparingly (only a very small amount is needed).  I wished I had been told that years ago.  The problem does reoccur but the drug always works and I then don't need it for a long time.  As I've grown older (I'm now 40 something)_ I find the need for the cream more often.  It used to only occur once every 5 or more years_ now it's coming back every year.  The drug does still take care of it_ however.,F,45,30  years,6/5/2006,Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide
