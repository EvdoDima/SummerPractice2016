0, 5, DI,none that we know of,My four year old grandaughter that we have custody of has been on DDAVP all her little life. A life saver for her. It help regulate her urine output nicely. Nasal spray twice daily.,,46,4  years,12/6/2009Email,Ddavp
1, 5, Diabetes Insipidus,None,I love it! After brain surgery I didn't know how I was going to survive going to the bathroom every 20 minutes. I take DDAVP nasal spray and it works like a charm.  When taking other meds I have to increase the dosage_ but other than that it's a God send.  I use to spend $60 a month at the local CVS_ but I started mail order and I pay $10 for a seven month supply!  If you have mail order as an option check out the cost of the medicine.,F,38,5  years,9/17/2009,Ddavp
2, 5, Bed wetting/diabetes insipidus,Mild sinus irritation at first_ but it did go away over time.,I love this medication!!!  I see some people commenting about the cost of it.  Walgreen's carries it_ get their Walgreen's prescription card for $20 per year_ then you pay only $68 and some change.  I would be lost without it.  Even with our insurance_ it's still cheaper at Walgreen's.  I hope this helps anyone who is having trouble affording it.,M,34,10  years,7/23/2009,Ddavp

8, 5, Diabetes insipidus,Leg swelling if taking too much.,My daughter has been on DDAVP  since 1978_ 29 years.
