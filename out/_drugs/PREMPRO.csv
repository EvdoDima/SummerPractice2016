0, 4, Severe hot flashes,So far slight weight gain. No other side effects.,My hot flashes were unbearable and non-stop. Since taking this drug I no longer have them but I am greatly concerned with the possibility of breast cancer. I'm high risk (mother_ aunt_ grandmother had) and considering getting off the drug. Also_ I workout alot and weight gain is not an option I will accept.,F,48,2  weeks.03-1.5 1X D,7/18/2015Email,Prempro

8, 4, Severe hot flashes,Extreme breast tenderness_ acne_ weight gain_ fatigue,On the plus side it completely stopped my hot flashes. They were so bad I was unable to sleep at night. Now both of my breasts are extremely tender_ I have acne_ I am always tired_ and have gained 5 lbs in 3 months.  I have decided to cut back to taking it every third day to see if that helps.  I cannot stop taking it because the hot flashes were intolerable.,F,52,3  months.625 / 2.5 1X D,5/23/2012Email,Prempro
9, 3, pre menopause,No major side effects yet_ but always hungry_ and tired.,I had thermal ablation due to heavy periods_ which forced my body into menopause.  Then my hormones went crazy!  Severe night sweats_ breast tenderness_ extreme anxiety.  Blood work showed my body was very low on estrogen_ have been taking this for 3 months_ night sweats are gone_ anxiety is better.  Still have some breast tenderness_ but tolerable.  I am always extremely hungry_ and cannot get full.  Fatigue also.  I am going to see my doctor in a few weeks_ and hope she can help with how I'm feeling.,F,39,3  months.625 1X D,3/31/2011Email,Prempro
10, 4, perimenopause,Severe edema in my legs and feet - vascular malfunction.,I actually love the effects of this_ other than the edema - which is why I have to stop. I have a history of severe PCOS_ PMDD_ and Major Depression that led to years of disability and for the first time in a long time I feel great - other than the severe edema which is very painful and difficult to manage ( I feel like I am weighed down by wet cement ),F,42,1  months 1X D,3/13/2011,Prempro
11, 4, Menopause,In six months_ no bad side effects. Good ones include losing the terrible night sweats_ less unexplained hunger (lost 8 lbs)_ better sleep patterns.   I think when analyzing ratings one has to see what the patient suffered from before. If she already suffered from depression_ it isn't fair to say depression was a side effect of Prempro...if she had depression and just had surgery_ who is to say it was the Prempro and not preexisting condition and/or life?,Working very well.,F,48,6  months.625 1X D,1/14/2011,Prempro
12, 1, Post oopharectomy HRT,The main side effect is severe depression. I began taking this after BRCA+ related removal of both ovaries. While this is managing the beginning menopausal symptoms of hot flash the depression is horrific; despite already taking an antidepressant.,I strongly recommend not taking this medication after my personal experience and reading about many others' experience.,F,37,8  days0.625/2.5 1X D,11/17/2010,Prempro
13, 1, menopause/ mood swings,I have gained 41/2 lbs in 3 months. I have acne like I'm a teenager. Did not fight acne as a teenager but do now. I get heart burn. Can not sleep less then 9 hours a night_ groggy all day. Have no energy. Have had periods that last up to 10 days_ every two-three weeks. (Heavy periods).I also have back problems prempro make it worse_ can't hardly get around some days because of joint pain. I think I would rather go thru menopause bitchy!!!,,F,51,3  months0.3mg 1X D,5/10/2010,Prempro

15, 2, Depression,Got my period for over 2 1/2 weeks and decided to come off it.  I feel like I've been hemorraging since stopping about five days ago.  It did nothing for my depression as far as I can tell so I wouldn't advise it to help with this!,"My doctor didn't think a blood test would be helpful before whipping out her Rx pad.  When I returned and asked her about side effects_ she mentioned cancer_ stroke and heart attack. I told her I was already at risk for stroke and heart attack and she said ""so you may as well take it.""  Needless to say_ I'm starting with a new MD ASAP!",F,52,35  days,11/28/2009,Prempro
16, 1, menopause,Breast cancer - this is an extremely dangerous drug and it's a crime that it was approved by the FDA. Do not take this drug. It's better to go through menopause naturally or use herbal medicine.,After cancer I had surgery_ chemo and radiation. Now I am in chemo induced menopause which is far worse than natural menopause. It only bought me a few years of benefit for a lifetime of greif.,F,49,6  days,2/15/2009,Prempro
17, 3, hotflashes every 15-20 minutes,in my second month of the Rx.  Good results at first.  Now have begun menstrating again after a year and a half absense.(Absence of menses was the only good thing I find about menopause.)  Am 53 years old.  Menses is now in 7th day.  hot flashes continue at night even with medication so now take Ambien (generic).,Don't know if I will stay on it or try a natural compounding.  am not crazy about having a period for the rest of my life.,F,53,70  days,8/15/2008,Prempro
18, 1, Perimenopause,"Severe breast swelling and tenderness - bra_ no bra_ didn't matter - way too sensitive.  Even sleeping on them hurt.  Didn't help my PMS_ and after a year and a half_ trying different combinations of ""prem"" and ""pro""_ and not really feeling right at all_ I read about the dangers of HRT and decided I needed to find another way.  My mother was on HRT for about 20 years_ and developed breast cancer and had her gallbladder removed.  And all that estrogen over all those years didn't keep her from shrinking in height. Don't believe all the baloney from the ads on TV - and don't expect your doc to be too up on this stuff either_ since all they know is what the pharmaceutical sales rep tells them.","At 43_ I had a period that lasted 18 days and severe depression - my doc did an estrogen blood test_ and finding it low_ put me on Prempro. I have since learned a lot - like women that are still having periods should not be put on estrogen!  And_ blood tests are worthless when measuring estrogen!  Ladies_ do your homework - read Dr. John Lee's book_ ""What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause""_ and make those simple changes.  I found a copy in my local library_ and found it so compelling I bought it for myself and my mother.  I now use over the counter bioidentical progesterone cream_ walk and lift weights_ take a good supplement with calcium_ Vit. D and magnesium and feel much better even though I'm three years older.  You don't have to be a slave to the pharmaceutical companies!",F,46,1.5  years,7/7/2008,Prempro
19, 1, HRT following early complete hyster,Weight gain (about 25# first year!)_ bloating_ breast tenderness_ fatigue_ depression_ acne_ indigestion - I hate this drug!,Had complete hysterectomy/both ovaries removed at age 42 for endometriosis. Need progestins to counteract estrogen which causes endo to regrow. Am prone to depression - but this is the worst! I weight more than ever in my life and have no energy at all.  Am about to start a different progestin formula because this is the pits.,F,43,14  months,4/13/2008Email,Prempro

21, 1, Bled for 4 months,Drug info says not to take if bleed too long_ but Prempro is exactly what I got! Having my tubes tied threw me into early menopause at 39_ with severe cramps & longer periods.Leg Pain_ varicose veins. Yes_ I am now concerned that I may have gallbladder disease because of attacks I have. Quit taking Prempro. Also period free now.,,F,53,5  years,8/16/2007,Prempro
22, 2, HRT after PCOS and Ovaries removed,Gall bladder disease!!! Counteracts Synthroid prescribed for hypothyroidism!!!!,"In 2000 I was diagnosed with PCOS. Took prempro to reduce cysts and re-establish cycle after many years of two or less per year. After 3 months had to have both ovaries removed due to benign tumors. After a few months started having Gall bladder attacks. After about a year ended up in the hospiital with infection and ""Thousands of Stones"". Received IV antibiotics for 5 days and had Gall bladder removed.  Continued on Prempro for a few years following that.  Developed Hypothyroidism and began taking Synthroid for that.  The estrogens in Prempro counteract the thyroid meds so I asked Gyn to reduce dosage. Seemed to be working ( have begun to lose weight FINALLY) but on last sonogram had thickening of uterine lining so was taken off of Prempro(with the thyroid meds working my body started making its own Estrogen and that's why I needed more progesterone than was in the lowest dose of Prempro that I took) will begin progesterone only and see how i do.",F,38,5  years,6/13/2007Email,Prempro

24, 3, Post-menopausal,bloating_ breast tenderness_ indigestion_ weight gain,I'm not sure if the bloating_ breast tenderness and indigestion are all from the Prempro_ but while I was on Prometrium and Vivelle-Dot for 2 1/2 years_ I felt wonderful. I just couldn't pay for two co-payments_ it was too costly.  I agree with another comment posted regarding the 28 day cycle.  Post-menopausal women do not need a 28 day cycle_ they don't have menstrual periods! I think that women are treated indifferently by insurance and drug companies.,F,46,2  months,4/26/2006,Prempro

26, 1, FOR HRT,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.... it's the progestin (provera) and not the estrogen. It gives me breast tenderness_ ouchies_ bloat_ weight gain_ cramps.  It does the same when I take it separately as in Provera.  The estrogen itself never bothers me.,I absolutely hate having to take this... and am now on a longer term estrogen alone for months before I do add it for 2 weeks. (prometrium now) never again the Provera.   And have no problems with an increase of uterine thickening. Just bad stuff_ and the more I've read is most likely the cause of the increase in breast cancer and NOT the estrogen content.,F,53,6  months,12/10/2002,Prempro

28, 4, Post menopausal symptoms,,"I am currently taking Prempro and covered by HMO.  I have a concern regarding the doses (28) per month in the Prempro package.  When my husband has a drug prescribed_ he gets 30 doses per month.  However_ I only get 28---forcing me to pay an additional copay on an additional month's supply of 28 to cover the year.  Consequently_ my year's supply (subsidized by HMO) costs more than his.  Also_ my year's prescription always expires after 12 fills and I am inconvenienced by having to phone my doctor for an extension prior to my yearly checkup. I contacted my HMO about this and was told that it was packaged that way because of a woman's 28-day cycle and that any complaints I had should be addressed by the drug company. Do they not realize that a post-menopausal woman no longer has a ""cycle""? In discussions with other women we would much prefer 30 doses per month than 28. I believe this is just another way to ""gouge"" women at the pharmacy.  ",F,56,3  years,6/6/2001Email,Prempro
