8, 3, Gout,Started it 7 weeks ago but was on 300mg came off it after a week due to side effects. Aches foggy etc. bad idea to stop it. Resulted in a massive painful gout attack for 6 weeks. Tried everything my uric acid level was stuck at 9-10. I went on NSAIDs twice for relief then a course of oral steroids. My uric acid level was now 9. My doctor put me back on alpurinol 100mg and within 3 days pain subsided from a 8/9 to a 2. I took colchicine for the first 2 days and stopped due to stomach problems.i only take alpurinol now and am going to stay on 100mg for two months then going for a blood test to check my uric acid level again. If not much or no improvement I may increase it under my doctors supervision to 200 mg a day then same again after 2 months etc...I also have cut out bread with wheat in and cereals and now have low gluten free bread and cereals. This has helped my attacks I believe and the pain.,Makes me tired for a while after taking... Colchicine only controls the pain but will do nothing at all to lower uric acid levels. Only allopurinol can lower levels,M,53,7  days100,10/22/2015Email,Allopurinol

I will take my chances on the gout episodes rather than feel sick_ foggy_ and crampy every day of my life.

20, 1, syndrom of a gout attack,very low blood pressure_ fever_ dizzy_ very tired dry mouth and headache_ diarrhoea_ red blooders and blisters all over her body. itchiness_ disoriented.,My Mom took the medicine for round about 3 weeks. She got it from her doctor shortly before she left on vaction. The doctor described to her because of a kind of gout attack although knowing that she had kidney and liver problems. 21 days after she took it_ we picked her up at her vacation and brought her straight to the hospital. They did not immediately know what it was and medically malpracied her_ another 20 days later SHE WAS DEAD. She died of an over reaction of Allopurinol on the so called LYELL SYNDROM. She died an awful dead as her body was burned for more than 70% outside and her whole muscosa dissolved in her mouth_ her throat_ her vagina. She should have never taken this devils medicine.,F,75,21  days300 1X D,8/31/2014Email,Allopurinol

24, 5, Gout,initially general malaise but that was probably the gout effecting me than the zyloprim. Once the gout cleared all seemed ok. Scary side effect is erectile disfunction. Onset about 4 months ago.,Taken allopurinol on and off since 29. Cycling with me getting an attack_ colchicine to kill that off_ then allopurinol - usually 200mg. Usually then after 7 months of no attacks I (hitherto the most recent attack that is) would drop the meds_ thinking I could 'boof' it out and invariably I'd be hammered with another attack within 12-18 months - rinse and repeat. Now I aim to stay on allopurinol permanently. Worryingly I've noticed erectile performance has been severely affected in last 4 months whilst on 300mg-very embarrassing at times and no good for the psyche. Only meds I'm on so if it's meds that's it. Never ever had ed b4. I've put on weight but at 85kg and 180cm I'm not that obese.  Can get an erection but not nearly as readily as before. Once a week now if lucky. Use rowing_ spin machines but always have before without having been so drastically effected. It's like things are being heavily repressed rather than totally blocked. After today's celebrations (Australia Day) I'll drop the meds for a few months and see what happens. Then start and stay around 150-200mg as that was ample b4 and never had ed effects. Allopurinol also is beneficial for benign prostate enlargement so perhaps that might explain things. I don't have that but there might be some interactions happening down there.,M,45,6  months300 1X D,1/25/2014,Allopurinol

28, 4, severe gout in both feet,intermittent stomach ache.  frequent headache.  Overall ok.,I am 43 years old...and suffered the past 15 years with gout pain in my big toes. Going back about 6 months ago i would get pain throughout my whole foot that would basically cripple me. And for no apparent reason as far as diet went to avoid gout triggering foods.  I had spent years taking Pro-gout and Colgout tablets which were fine and my attacks would subside within a couple of days. BUT i wopuld suffer terrible stomach ulcer pain and cramps due to it.  4 months ago my doctor did blood tests_ and due to very high uric acid levels he put me on a 5 day course of Prednisolone which eased me into the daily taking of 1 Allopurinol tablet.  The Prednisolone was fantastic and i suffered NO stomach upset...the daily taking of Allopurinol has COMPLETELY taken away my foot pain and i have already had small amounts of foods and drinks which i religiously avoided with no gout pain or effects.  I can at times get an upset gut but it passes quickly.   In my opinion and after suffering chronic gout for years....THIS works. Allopurinol is my saviour!  I once took black cherry juice and i caused me much grief and allergy!  If you suffer gout....talk to your doctor about a treatment of Predisolon easing you into a daily tablet of Allopurinol at a milligram that suits your system and you will be FREE!!    :-),M,43,4  months100mg 1X D,4/25/2013Email,Allopurinol
29, 1, High uric acid levels,Took one pill - after a few hours_ turned pink all over like a lobster_ with a rash over most of my body. Went to wee in the night - fainted/collapsed for the first time in my life_ and was out for 15-20min_ accoring to my wife. Taken to hospital and received intravenous steroids (cortisone) which helped a bit; now at home just taking piriton - the rash is still really bad after 4 days. I have NEVER had an allergic reaction before to any food or medicine.,I was first given allopurinol some months ago in conjunction with chemotherapy for leukaemia_ to remove uric acid from the breakdown of cancer calls. I also had a bad rash then_ which I thought was down to the chemo (it was a possible side effect). This time_ not having had any chemo for 4 months_ I'm sure the result was caused by the allopurinol. My wife thought I was dead. I won't be taking it again.,M,64,1  days100 1X D,1/21/2013,Allopurinol
30, 5, for gout pain,no side effects for me. It doesn't work immediately_ but slowly reduces attacks as uric acid diminishes in the blood.,I inherited gout from my Dad's side. Started at age 30 _ and I'm now 56.. If i miss my allopurinol for over a week_ it can be felt in my lower joints_ so I have learned by experience to not miss.  It is too painful.  I take 150 mg/a day. If the uric acid is allowed_ thru not taking meds_ to build up in the system_ it will take a long time (from my experience_ up to 3 months) to reduce back again to normal. I also have found out that the gout is way worse when overweight. Damn_ isn't that just the way it goes with about every disease?Bottom line_ don't ignore this this sleeping giant for too long. I got cocky 3 yrs ago and thought I could ignore taking the allopurinol for a few months. I ended up with excruciatingly painful swollen knees off and on for about 6 months_ and my legs literally atrophied from lack of motion_ because I was on crutches.  Today I am completely pain free_ due to allopurinol.,M,56,20  years150 1X D,1/16/2013,Allopurinol
31, 5, gout,none,Prior to starting to take allopurinol for gout in my foot_ I was looking into having my shoulder operated on because of sharp pain in my shoulder that I'd been having for a number of years.

I have not been taking allopurinol for a couple of weeks and the shoulder problems just started to re-occur.,M,56,1  years20 MG 1X D,11/7/2012Email,Allopurinol
32, 5, UC (Ulcerative Colitis),None due to the Allopurinol itself. However_ I take it as a XO inhibitor_ to change the metabolism of Azathioprine. The Allop+AZA combo causes mild anemia (11.5-12.0 Hgb).,Allopurinol increases by about 3x-4x the level of an Azathioprine metabolite that helps keep UC in remission (6TGN)_ and reduces manifold the levels of another AZA metabolite that is toxic to the liver (6MMPN). A combo with Allop (75mg) + AZA (50mg) has kept my severe pancolitis in remission_ and brought down the level of 6MMPN from >10_000 to ,M,59,2  years75 1X D,10/23/2012Email,Allopurinol

37, 2, Gout,Itching_ Welts swelled up in random locations_ headaches_ nausea_ every joint in my body hurts now instead of just my ankle. This stuff is awful I have not had an attack in three years and the only thing I was doing was eating a bag of black cherries per every two weeks and bought enough bags to freeze for when not in season and this winter I didn't  buy before the last shipment to the grocery store and low And behold 65 days no cherries and the gout is in full effect. Took allupurinol to try and make it till June but forget that I am headed to grocery store getn some cherry juice and going to choke it down it really does work and no side effects these damn doctors need to get educated on the issues they are diagnosing I was advised on cherries from my chiropractor go figure the one doctor insurance companies don't want to pay for the ones that help without the use of drugs!,,M,37,6  days300,3/18/2012Email,Allopurinol

41, 3, High Uric Acid Levels,fluctuating weight_ rash_ severe kidney stone build up (uric acid stones),I had severe attacks associated with uric acid levels when diagnosed.  I was told the usual_ stop the red meat_ smoking_ drinking and trigger food etc_ problem was and is that I am a non drinker_ smoker and had been a vegetarian for a couple years prior to first diagnosis and remained so for another 2 years afterwards while they mucked with diet.  Instead of gout symptoms I occasionally got the weight/rash issues and when I went in for a blocked urethra this year I was informed of the discovery of 6 additional stones in my right and 4 in the left kidney and all of them well over the 11mm range_ all uric acid stones.  My system has not been flushing but harboring it for several years.  Allopurinol has lost effectiveness and I am still now in the process of surgery for removal.  Strongly suggest if you have been on this for several years to get an ultrasound on the kidneys and verify your body has not turned to working around the drug as mine has.,M,38,17  years200 mg 1X D,9/26/2011Email,Allopurinol
