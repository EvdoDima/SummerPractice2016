11, 2, Depression,I started rubbing my big toe and the one right beside it back and forth constantly (24/7). This is happening with both feet. Even when wearing tight shoes which makes my toes ache. I quit taking the Ability about a year ago because of this but this annoying side effect won't go away. I have to put Bandaids on my toes to keep from getting calluses. It is so bad that i wear holes through the Bandaids. I think this nerve wrecking side effect is permanent!  I regret ever taking it!,As far as helping with my depression there was very little difference.,F,60,2  years5 MG,3/13/2016Email,Abilify
12, 5, depression,Good effect within 5 days. Better concentration and less procrastination. Mood stable. Sleepy a bit. Will take at night.,I suppose this med is good depending on the other stuff one has been diagnosed with. Too many young people on too many different meds. I take Lexapro 20 MG /day. This is a good med for certain types of depression. Multiple disorders are another issue I think.,F,58,10  weeks5mg,3/9/2016,Abilify
13, 5, Bipolar 1 Disorder,Easily Angered.,Abilify has saved my life and made the quality of it back to normal. I tried every med in the book and was in a mental hospital for 9 months. I do not get the akathesia_ insomnia_ or weight gain. I switched from Invega due to tenderness of the nipple. I notice this drug is used at its full potential by CLASSIC Bipolar 1 individuals. Bipolar 2 people it doesn't help with your depression. I used to take Abilify with Lithium but my Lithium levels were so low for a long time due to weight gain from Invega that I only take Abilify now. My only itch with this medicine is that it makes me easily angered.,M,21,4  months5 MG 1X M,3/4/2016Email,Abilify
14, 4, Treatment Resistant Depression,Weight gain,I think this drug is good_ and actually helps for serious depression. I haven't had any serious episodes while taking it_ but it's not a miracle drug. I have gained 20 pounds since starting this medication. I feel like I crave carbohydrates more. The weight gain has really been a struggle for me_ but if it keeps the depression to a somewhat tolerable level_ then I suppose it's worth it.,F,39,6  months5 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Abilify
15, 1, diagnosed with bipolar,50 lb weight gain. Akathesia_ constipation_ suicidal thoughts_ depression_ restlessness_,Abilify is a horrible drug and did nothing for me but harm. What it does is cause a whole host of extremely undesirable side effects (as well as make drug companies very rich_ as do all antipsychotics.) Given my years of experience with antipsychotics I have come to despise them because of their inefficacy to provide any substantial benefit_ what they do is completely numb emotions and cause mental states like apathy and also suicidal ideations_ they are also effective at sedation and taking away a persons will to live. I also philosophically do not believe the current mental health model because its all geared towards making a profit at the cost of the livelihoods of patients. It is all a shameful scam and if you have a choice you should all-together avoid the system. Do so at all costs for your own well-being.,M,28,1  years10 MG 1X D,3/1/2016,Abilify
16, 5, Depression augmented with abilify,Nausea_ acne_ itching skin. Restlessness_ talking a lot need to read and walk around at the same time_ vomiting after reasonably vigorously exercises such as walking. Slowed intestinal motility_ minor food cravings_ I'm watching the weight gain and fighting it to the death. This is NOT necessary!! It is so far the least of the culprits for mysterious and seemingly uncontrollable weight gain. I would blame some or most of that on the effects and the way the body is affected from hormones like prolactin and others you just can't control your own entire brain.  First two days at 2 mg I was light headed hungry nauseous and walking and excercizing to work through the beginning,Hunger not uncontrollable! Eat the healthy food. Prepair meals maybe if you have motivation to use! Yes I had the restlessness. I kept reading thinking and pacing. Walk; even if it's a small space indoors. It's worth working through its my favorite choice so far in regards to the PARTIAL agonist at select dopamine receptors it worked fast. I might get to a point where my depression could lift and I would feel happy again_ like the early school years! I have high hopes now.,F,31,3  months10mg,2/26/2016,Abilify
17, 2, Sever bipolar with psychotic feat.,"Apathy_ extreme coldness to loved ones_ lethargy_ wait gain of around 50 lbs_ spontaneous near fainting dizzyness ( horrible while working) nausea and vomiting.  I don't know if this counts as a side effect but after Abilify I don't trust taking any pill even ""harmless"" ones. (Was told Abilify is harmless)",Hate it. It made me mellow and not hear voices but at what cost? I became so apathetic towards my partner and parents I didn't care if I saw them or not. Didn't care if I was hurting them or not ( never pysicaly). Had no goals or drive to do anything just wanted to sit. Not do anything. And veg. Several times at work I almost fainted and was suspected to be on illegal drugs because I just left not caring about informing my employer. Did nothing for my extreme paranoia and may have made it worse as was somewhat forced to take this drug by my partner. Before I took it I was bad and really delusional so I understand why but I still resent them for it. So I stopped taking it and slowly got back to my manic self... I think I like this better than feeling dead but not caring. My guy wants me back on it but idk if can even bring myself to eat another pill.,M,20,1  years20,2/7/2016,Abilify

20, 5, Bipolar disorder,When starting the med I noticed a difference in manic/depressive cycling within 2 weeks and was stabilized and at baseline by 4 weeks. I was very impressed. I did experience some weight gain but it was not bothersome for me. I also experienced blurred vision that became progressively worse as I continued to take the medication. Discontinuing use does not improve this. In fact my eyes continue to become more and more blurred and frankly I AM concerned with going blind eventually. Other side effects I have experienced discontinuing abilify are nausea vomiting and drastic weight loss for about 3 weeks after my last dose. I will note that I was not nauseous or vomiting until about 2 weeks after my last dose. I also experienced body dysmorphia from the weight loss which made the depression and mania cycling worse. I have not enjoyed discontinuing the drug and look forward to securing another prescription soon. Also since continuing I constantly feel itchy especially my hands and feet and shoes are inconvenient because if this. I also have lost an alarming amount of hair. I do find this somewhat distressing. I have not had any medication since discontinuing 4.5 months ago and am currently in manic cycle.,,F,43,5  years40 mg,1/23/2016Email,Abilify
21, 2, psy: you need to control your brain,After initially taking the drug in my early 20s I was convinced that it was helping me_ clarifying my thoughts_ lifting my mood_ giving me some stability in my changing life events and difficult experiences_ the shock of dropping out of uni + other things. After a couple of years I noticed It became harder to study_ and remember things but I took this as something that I had to work harder on to overcome. Only after I graduated from uni and decided to come off it myself_ I experienced terrible effects: these are as follows_ brain paralysis_ terrible short term memory_ forgetting things in seconds_ repeat what I do_ and do not know what I have done. There are times when my memory is so poor it just goes blank and I feel I may have alzheimers. My concentration is so bad_ I miss obvious detail. My neck twists in contortions it is so embarrassing- tardive dystonia which has not been diagnosed. During withdrawal I had terrible headaches_ nothing for the pain_ I could not sleep at all as the,Abilify may seem good at first but do not take it for a very long time on your own.

22, 5, Schitzoaffective/Psychosis,fatigue_ after giving birth_ had to increase methadone,Abilify worked great when I was pregnant. I was also on 15mg methadone. After I had the baby_ though_ I was exhausted_ and had to increase to 40 and it was hard to taper down on the methadone. I stopped taking it 8 months after I had the baby. It didn't completely get rid of the hallucinations and delusions_ but I was able to rationalize them and not get out of control.,F,34,16  months15mg 1X D,1/2/2016Email,Abilify
23, 2, Anorexia Nervosa Depression/Anxiety,WEIGHT GAIN of 30 pounds_ excess appetite_ EXTREME tiredness_ acne_ facial dropping_ dizziness,I was put on this medication for my anxiety/OCD surrounding my anorexia nervosa. It stopped the anorexia in it's tracks_ but it killed me. It was only supposed to be a short term medication_ but my parents tried to cut me off cold turkey and at bad times so they thought I was addicted when I wasn't. I was able to eventually taper off it and lose all the weight I gained on it. As a result I was on it for two years. I gained 30 pounds. Some weight was normal_ but I think 15 of it was excess. I couldn't lose the weight no matter what I did to exercise_ and I couldn't stop eating and could never tell when I was hungry or full. I got made fun of so much and my own family made fun of me_ so my depression got worse. It also made me VERY VERY tired. I initially started at 5 mg but then I had to go to 2.5 because I almost fainted because it made me so tired_ and even the 2.5 made me tired enough to have to take naps during the day. I also had facial drooping for the first week_ but then that went away. I was told that was normal. It did it's job with helping stop the anorexia but the side effects were brutal and it didn't help my other problems.,F,20,2  years2.5 1X D,12/29/2015,Abilify

It also slowed down my metabolism. I gained 25 pounds in three months_ and it took me almost 18 months to lose that weight because of my sluggish metabolism.

Nausea_ acid reflux. Some people stare at me like I'm weird in public.,I was given this to help me calm down my thoughts. I have social phobia and I don't think it's helped this at all; it may have made it worse. When I go out to restaurants_ I feel more wired_ and it's not a pleasant feeling_ but it's hard to describe. I do notice some benefits_ like I'm not walking around like a wounded_ hurting animal anymore_ and when I see things that used to make me feel jealous or hurt (like couples or friends together_ or women with babies) it no longer has such a hurtful impact on me. I don't know what to do with this medicine_ b/c I notice benefits_ but the increased uncomfortable feeling is kind of hard to deal with_ and the worst thing is that some other people look at me like something's wrong with me. This has happened at the past 2 restaurants I went to; two different older men looked at me like there was something wrong with me.  I am on the fence with this drug; I think I should give it more time to see how I adjust_ but the uncomfortable_ wired_ anxious-like feeling I get from it can be embarrassing for me_ especially when other people look at me like there's something wrong with me.

49, 1, OCD; adjunct to Zoloft,At first I had no side effects or benefits from the drug_ so my doctor had me titrate up to 6 mg a day_ over a period of about a month. I was only on 6 mg for about a day before I ran out of medication_ so I went two days without any Abilify at all_ and then went back on 6 mg. Within half a day of restarting the drug_ I was more anxious and panicky than I've ever experienced_ and that's saying something. I was paranoid and developed massive social anxiety issues almost immediately_ thinking everyone was constantly discussing how weird I was_ reanalyzing conversations I had and feeling incredibly embarrassed at everything I said. I started having non-stop insatiable What-Ifs that were totally implausible_ but were so terrible to me that I wanted to jump out a window just to distract myself from the unstoppable stress and doubt. I read afterward that Abilify has a very long half life - about 3 days. It's been about 6 days since I stopped the drug and the anxiety is not much better. I can,Abilify is scarier than any drug I've been prescribed. If your life isn't already at rock bottom_ I'd be very wary of risking this drug_ especially with so many others saying the same sort of thing.,F,30,30  days6 mg 1X D,5/28/2015Email,Abilify

This feeling of restlessness has persisted for 14 months AND COUNTING after discontinuing. It has been the most devestating thing of my life. THIS DRUG SHOULD NOT BE LEGAL. BE AFRAID. I took dozens of psyc meds including seroquel by the handful for 10 years and nothing that bad ever came of it. Is this permanent?

It sucked because it made me severly hungry_ like I could never get enough food but I ignored the extra hunger and still cut myself off when I knew I was full. But everytime I ate_ if I did not throw up I would have a lingering nausea that lasted all day to the point that I actually had to make myself throw up in order to feel better. The sickness would not go away until I vomited so if it didn't happen on its own_ I would force myself to. Not good_ I am not bulemic. Also noticed weight gain even with constant vomiting. Puking that much should never result in weight GAIN. Also caused crippling dizziness_ had to lay down throughout the day or I felt like I was going to faint. So I stopped taking it.,F,29,3  weeks40mg 1X D,5/6/2015,Abilify

55, 1, adhd and mood swingd,My son has been taking this medicine for about four months at first he was taking 5mg and it didn't seem to do much once the Dr upped his dosages to 10mg I seen a huge change he went from active to extremely tired falling asleep in class on the toliet or just randonly. His attitude changed too. He became very calm after taking it at first but after a few hours he would lose it hitting himself and others. Yelling and was very impatient. His appetite changed too he went from barely eating to wanting to eat all the time and now he doesn't eat much at all. For about the last two months he has been super constipated and throws up randomly at night. But has no recollection Of what happened like he does it when he's sleeping. This med definitely is scaring me specially now that I read coming off of it can cause even more problems I feel bad for putting my son on it for the first place.,,M,6,4  months10mg,4/17/2015Email,Abilify
56, 4, Severe depression,For the first week or so I experienced nausea and dizziness_ but that went away. My depression lifted within a few weeks. I could function again! I became much more social_ and I was able to focus on my studies.However_ I gained 20 pounds within two months. Yikes! After that_ the rate of weight gain slowed down to about 2-3 pounds more per month. The weight gain triggered binge/purge cycles_ and eventually I stopped taking it because I couldn't deal with the insatiable hunger. After I stopped taking it_ I became suicidal again.,The med made me gain weight_ but it totally helped my depression!!! That being said_ even AFTER I stopped the med_ I wasn't able to lose the weight I gained no matter how much I dieted or exercised. It's like my metabolism had completely changed.,F,20,9  months5 mg,4/16/2015Email,Abilify
57, 4, Depression/Anxiety,After taking Cymbalta 60mg for some time with limited results_ my psychiatrist recommended that I add Abilify to the mix.   After doing so_ I noticed a marked improvement.   It was as if I had been lifted out of my funk for the first time in quite some time.   I recommend this drug.   As far as the weight gain everyone complains about_ I have a solution:  Do not eat so much.  This medication cannot cause you to gain weight per se; consuming more calories can_ however.   You must monitor what you eat_ and you must exercise.   Besides_ doing  so_ along with drinking plenty of water will_ I believe_ mitigate any other unwanted side effects.,,M,47,6  months5mg 1X D,4/14/2015,Abilify
