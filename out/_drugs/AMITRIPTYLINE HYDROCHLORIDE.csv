0, 1, Sleep Disorder,Worked brilliantly at first_ started on 10mg but I had to keep increasing the dose until I ended up on 50mg. Then the hallucinations began and suicidal thoughts. Coming off it was damned scary!! I My doc tried to get me back on it despite my reaction and I haven't been back to him. Hallucinations at night mostly seeing figures in my room_ then was manic felt exhilarated one minute then completely a mess the next. Felt like my skin was burning_ thought I was going mad. I lost control of my temper often. Vivid_ scary as f#*k dreams waking in a complete sweat and screaming. I was on it for a year total and it took seven months to come off and eventually feel normal again. Scariest time of my life,,F,38,1  years50mg 1X D,12/18/2015,Amitriptyline hydrochloride
