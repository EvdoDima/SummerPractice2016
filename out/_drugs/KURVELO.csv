0, 4, Hormone balance_ contraception,First month: painful (non-period) abdominal cramping for most of the first month. Unusually long and heavy period. Increased fatigue and brain fog for most of this time as well.,The first month of being on Kurvelo was probably the worst I've ever experienced in starting new birth control. I almost quit_ especially with the fatigue during and following that horrendous period. But I stuck through it and I've evened out to a much more normal state since then. The start is rocky but can be worth it for women looking for more regular periods and a good contraceptive.,F,30,2  months.15mg,11/24/2014Email,Kurvelo
