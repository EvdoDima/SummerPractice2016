0, 2, RRMS,I was diagnosed August of 2015 and started copaxone Sept/October 2015. I ended up stopping around Feb/March of 2016. I would get dime or quarter size welts at the injection site_ shortness of breath_ a flush feeling and anxiety from the shot to the point of crying. I would get these horrendous chills that would like 45 min. Nothing could warm me. So I eventually just stopped taking it overall,I would like to try something different. My neuro doesn't like the pills as he calls them ineffective and can cause liver problems. I was looking into the monthly IV medication. But the side effect of that is brain disease_ which I don't think is worth it.,F,25,6  months40 3X W,8/8/2016,Copaxone

3, 5, RRMS,"It always blows my mind to read about severe side effects being attributed to Copaxone. I have never experienced a single adverse reaction in the 18 years I've been taking it (that's over 6_500 injections!). I consider the mild discomfort at the injection site a small price to pay for the benefit of experiencing fewer relapses -- and ultimately protecting my brain for the future. I am 100% certain that I would be in a wheelchair by now if Copaxone hadn't come along when it did. I do envy the patients who are newly diagnosed and can get started on the 40mg right away -- as they will likely experience very little lipoatrophy -- the only adverse reaction I've had to ""endure."" But I'm not in a wheelchair_ I'm still working full time_ I cycle at least 1_500 miles per year (in rainy Seattle!)_ and I honestly believe that none of that would be true if I hadn't started on Copaxone immediately after my diagnosis.","Of all the medications out there now (there was only Avonex & Betaseron when I was diagnosed -- we've sure come a long way since then!!)_ I believe Copaxone to be the most convenient (3x/week injections with an AutoJect) and most effective with the least amount of side effects. If I were newly diagnosed_ I would start with Copaxone. If it doesn't seem to work_ or if the injection site reactions are too severe_ there are more than a dozen other FDA approved meds to try. But I feel like I ""won the lottery"" when Copaxone was released right after my diagnosis.",F,50,18  years40mg 1X D,10/23/2015EmailHistory,Copaxone
4, 2, MS Dx 11-2014,When I first begin I just had basic normal injection site burning_ pain_ itching_ redress and swelling. I use a cold compress for about 30 minutes to an hour following the injection and was fine. I always did my injections at night before bed and in the morning after I always wake up with severe flu like symptoms fever the whole nine yards but Dr said this is better than the alternative. So I continue to take Copaxone now October 2015 6 months after starting Copaxone I relapsed causing the usual cycle of IV Steroids as well as follow up with pill form.  So I continue taking it and for the second time now shortly after my relapse but the first time this happened  before my relapse.  About 30 minutes after taking the injection I start feeling really flush heart racing and then extremely extremely cold to the point that I shake my entire bed chattering and usually I'm very hot but this happens and I get extremely cold like I lose every ounce of heat in my body_ my body goes into full body spasms I yawn excessively my eyes water I can't see anything it's like my whole body is in pain and my muscles are reacting in some sort of strange seizure type of occurrence. This can last for an hour to several hours causing me to hardly sleep through the night and then when I wake up the next morning as usual I feel the normal flu like symptoms. Now I was willing to deal with the painstaking side effects but when I relapsed I'm thinking now what is this really doing to help me its supposed t,Going to see what else is available,F,33,6  months40 mg 3x w,9/25/2015Email,Copaxone

I did NOT. I was scared of Tysabri. After finding that it caused me severe respiratory distress and bladder infections_ I went back on Copaxone last week. For the first time in 7 years I had a site reaction: a huge red welt of hives_ hot as a furnace. I put cold on it and it left after 25 minutes. This drug has been very good for me_ and oddly_ when I started it I ceased having migraine headaches. I do occasionally have weak legs after injecting_ and reactions can happen no matter how many years you've been on the drug. As I already had depression_ Avonex or Betaseron weren't options. The only real concern I have is of lipoatrophy_ as I'm running out of places to inject. I've hit a blood vessel occasionally_ never pleasant_ but nothing permanent.

24, 3, multiple sclerosis,When I first started I had no issues but as I kept injecting ....,"About a year ago I started having the ""post injection site side effect"" [what feels like a heart attack / panic attack] Which I was told mostly effects people just starting Copaxone. What I found online is when you inject into a vein this will happen. To date I have had this happen 2 times. So now I have to really check where I inject. If I see any ""blue"" at all I will not inject in that spot or near. It's getting harder to find virgin spots . In Nov 2012 I noticed pitting edema in my shins. I've been through many tests which always seem to come back negative. I am interested to know .... If anyone else has huge lumps on the top of their legs. They seem to be permanent as they never go away.  I also have bad varicose veins on my legs near the injection sites. Is it possible that the medicine is either not being absorbed properly or the damage from injecting for years is some how stopping the flow of blood[fluid] from the knees down and causing pitting edema and stabbing pain and what feels like burning veins. On me my hips and legs are the worst. If I inject that day the pitting edema seems worse in that leg. A few days ago the pitting was gone and the day I injected into leg the pitting was back. I just put this together as being a cause so I am still interested to see if the pitting starts to go away and then when I inject again does it get worse and if it does it every time.

I feel better_ but I am sure that is only because I now know what I have and that Copazone will make it better. (Hopefully),I feel like I have made the right choice taking Copaxone because of the least amount of side effects.  I can deal with the medicine buring at time of injection and if I have a post injection side effect 20 mins. will end alot faster then being sick for days after as some of the other meds. can cause.

I would love to get some relief from the side effects.",,F,45,30  days20 mg 1X D,8/29/2011Email,Copaxone
51, 3, RRMS,Bee stinging feeling with burning.  Sometimes a lot of burning. Really itchy the next day and very hot to the touch that can last for days after.  The normal welts are always there.  I use a hot pack that Shared Solutions sent to me every night after my injection.  I apply pressure for about 45 mins to an hour with it which helps me.   I try to massage some of the bumps days later_ but it also causes it to be itchy again.  I've tried everything that my nurse from Shared Solutions has suggested for the itching_ but nothing has worked yet.  I just continue to itch.  I could be a lot worse i suppose.,I was diagnosed in Sept._ 2002.  I was stubborn about this type of treatment and perhaps in a bit of denial.   But i had a major attack New Years Eve Day weekend and i realized that i didn't want to go back to that again.   I started the Copaxone 7 months ago as of yesterday.  This is still new to me.   Every night it's different in some way and i still second guess the area's to be done.   My family is bending backwards for and with me.  I can't complain.   My husband does the injections on my buttocks and the back of my arms for me as i find it hard to reach.  My left limb from elbow to hand is still healing from the last attack and i find it very hard to use it.  I'm okay on my own with my thighs and tummy.    I can't say if this medication is doing anything for me as i don't notice a difference other then i'm alot better now then i was at the beginning of the attack.  I find i'm more tired through out the day also.  I see my neurologists in 2 days and i really hope he sends me for an MRI just to see if there is anything more going on.  I had a possible relapse 2 weeks ago that landed me back on IV meds.  But the doctor wasn't really sure if it was a continuation of the previous attack or a new one.   Hopefully some thing will become of this stuff.  I'm proud to say that i haven't missed a dose yet.  I'm getting better at it_ but i don't think you can every get use to doing it!!!!,F,31,7  months20mg 1X D,8/29/2011Email,Copaxone

53, 4, MS,Copaxone was great for the first 1.5 yrars. Then one evening right after the injection I started feeling hot and got a bitter taste in my month_ my chest felt heavy and I could bearly breath I got bad stomach cramps and had to go to the bathroom I was terrified went to the ER and they told me it was a reaction to the medication. not another reaction for a year then it just happend again last night_ I called my Neurologist and she said that other patients on that medication have been passing out_ and told me to stop taking it. I go see her next week hopefully we can find something else to keep my relapse remittin MS in check.,,F,47,4  years 1X D,8/1/2011Email,Copaxone
54, 5, rrms,the expected itching _ lumps in thighs_ slight stinging...... All things I can live with vs. The alternative.,Copaxone has helped me greatly!  No more tingling in legs_ no more weird sensation in my back when I tilt my head down_ no more numbness in my hand!  Yaaaay copaxy!  Only thing I am is extremely exhausted tired.... Boo! Not sure if that is related to the meds or just an MS thing....,F,35,9  months20 1X D,7/28/2011Email,Copaxone
55, 5, MS,Minimal side effects--I think.  My weight has fluctuated a lot over the last 21 years_ so I don't know if Copaxone has anything to do with that.  Same thing with anxiety & back pain.  I've been treated for anxiety since before I started Copaxone almost 12 years ago (started 10/99) and I'm quite heavy and my lifestyle is very sedentary_ so that's probably why I have back pain.  Sometimes I have injection site reactions (big lump_ pain_ hot feeling) but they don't last very long (just a few minutes).  The injection itself almost never hurts.  Sometimes I try to inject in a place where scar tissue is present and that hurts quite a bit and the needle doesn't want to go in.  So of course I try another spot and don't force it.,I think Copaxone is a great medicine.  The symptoms I used to have frequently (dizziness/light-headedness_ numbness in limbs) have all but disappeared.  And I haven't had a major relapse since I started Copaxone.  I continue to have severe_ chronic depression and a lot of anxiety_ but it is unknown whether that is caused by my MS.,F,45,11  years20 MG 1X D,7/24/2011Email,Copaxone
56, 2, Multiple sclerosis,itching_ lumps_ rashes_ dizziness after a week_ two months after an acute panic attack_ spasm and pain in his right hand_ now swollen lymph nodes in the groin,I stopped to inject into the hands because they have no fat and I think that the panic attack occurred because I'd probably hit a vein,M,40,4  months40 mg 3X W,7/18/2011Email,Copaxone
57, 5, Multiple Sclerosis,Redness and soreness at injection site; It can be a little embarrassing in a bikini to have welts but it is well worth it to be healthy and relapse free.,I have been on Copaxone for over 9 years and it has been terrific. Although the injections are not fun_ the medicine really works. Not only have I been relapse free_ but my lesions have gone away. Despite the injection daily (which I have gotten used to)_ I  cannot see myself changing medications since it is working so effectively and without side effects (other than the welts from the injections). I am looking ahead to kids and research shows you can continue to take it during pregnancy without harming the baby and continue taking it while you breast feed. Copaxone has kept me healthy_ feeling great_ and looking forward to not having another relapse for many years to come.,F,29,9  years1mg 1X D,7/15/2011Email,Copaxone
58, 4, RRMS,I get the usual injection site reactions_ a hive sometimes_ and the ghost bruises that stay for awhile. My main concern right now is that I feel I am immunosuppressed. Every three to four weeks I am coming down with a cold that often requires the use of antibiotics (azithromycin) to get rid of. This has been going on for the last 7 months and I don't know how to live a productive life like this. My doctors cannot figure it out_ and their only answer is that it is likely the copaxone which I am quite reluctant to stop. Is anyone else experiencing this?,I have not had a relapse in exactly one year. I think copaxone is an excellent treatment for MS and the injection site reactions are really quite negligible (for me personally) given that I would much rather have a hive than optic neuritis or another such relapse.,F,29,1.5  years20mg 1X D,7/15/2011Email,Copaxone
59, 3, MS,usual site reactions.  Itchy red lump.  Had first immediate post injection reaction after a year.  Flushing_ heart racing_ low back pain followed by chills for the day.  After that_ I noticed increased joint pain.  I do have arthritis_ but my hands were becoming increasingly stiff.  Had my 2nd immediate post injection reaction 8 month later...not as bad as first...but the joint pain became unbearable.  Neuro told me it's one of the side effects.  She took me off (med holiday) for three months.  I've been off for a month now and have absolutely NO joint pain in my hands!!!!  I Have another appointment in 2 months when we will decide whether to try one of the other drugs_ go back on the copaxone or use nothing.,My last MRI was done a week after this appointment.  There have been no changes in the past 2 years.  Was it the Copaxone?  Don't know.  Maybe I'll start back up in August.  I'm contemplating quality of life over the joint pain.  It seems to be doing what it's suppose to with the least amount of other worse side effects...I didn't want to mess with my liver or kidneys and I already have a thyroid problem.,F,52,2  years20 1X D,6/24/2011Email,Copaxone
