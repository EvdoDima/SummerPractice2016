0, 4, Acne scars and active acne,Peeling/irritation for the first 3 weeks_ sun sensitivity_ burned when I cried (my tears irriated my skin for some reason).,Currently 9 1/2 weeks in and my skin is improving a ton. I apply Tazorac .05% at night an hour after moisturizing_ and Aczone 5% in the morning after moisturizing as well. The important thing to remember with retinoids and basically any acne medication is patience. It was extremely discouraging about two weeks ago when I read all of these stories of people showing clear skin after only a month of Taz and here I was 7 weeks in and my skin wasn't improving_ but after reading other success stories of people sticking it out for months I decided to keep going.My skin isn't 100 % clear but it is so soft to the touch and the acne that I still have is very small scars that have faded tremendously.Finally feeling confident in my skin after struggling with moderate acne and overall greasiness for the past year_ and after trying every OTC acne treatment out there from Clearasil and Noxzema to make brands such as Dermalogica_ I've finally found something that helps my akin_ and I can't wait to see what my skin looks like by week 12 ( knock on wood),F,17,9  weeks.05%,7/6/2016,Tazorac
1, 5, Very mild acne_ pores & blackheads,Red irritated_sensitive_ preeling and flaking of the face.,Just like the other reviews on here I too was hesitant to try a product that would cause all those side effects. My dermatologist prescribed it to me and warned me to make sure I use moisturizer before applying TAZ. I didn't listen which was a big mistake. I think had I moisturized the side effects would not have been as bad. The first two weeks were the most embarrassing weeks. My skin looked like it was sunburnt and it felt that way. I wanted to quit but I stumbled upon this website and listened to what everyone said. STICK TO IT! I'm in my third week and although there is still some shedding going in small areas this medication is GREAT! I already see a difference. My pores look great the blackheads on my nose gone and even the small fine laugh line that even my plastic surgeon said Botox or juvederm could not fix is near to hardly visible. I hope that this review helps someone whose about to start or is going through what I went through. Your face will thank u for it. ; ),F,31,3  weeks0.05%,8/30/2015,Tazorac
2, 3, Acne,My skin has been dry the past few days_ not nearly as bad as other reviews have said but I'm avoiding dryness by putting on lotion before I use Tazorac.,I'm 15 years old and have been using acanya and Tazorac for about 2 weeks. My acne isn't that bad but it still bothers me since I'm the only one of my friends who has acne. I've had acne for a little over a year now and I've been to three different dermatologist which nothing they gave me helped. When I first started to use Tazorac and acanya I only had acne on my left cheek and tiny bumps on my forehead. The first few days I saw improvement but now after using this product for 2 weeks I've gotten more acne all the right side of my face!! And I'm so angry about it!! So far these products have done nothing but dry out my skin and cause more acne in places I've never had it. My dermatologist did say it will get worse before it gets better so maybe this is just a phase. When I read other reviews _ people saw improvement right away which really disappointed me when the same didn't happen to me. If you want to see improvement in your skin fast_ I wouldn't recommend either of these products.,F,15,2  days10,4/16/2015,Tazorac

5, 5, Adult acne,I've heard a lot about the burning and itching of Tazorac on the face. Believe me_ it's worth it! My derm recommended that I only use it every other night for the first week in order to give me/my face a chance to get accustomed to it. I started using it every night during the second week. I have to admit -- on the first night_ I washed it off because the itching and burning we as so bad. For those who are just beginning this medication_ my take on it is that it dries out blemishes WHILE SLOWLY BURNING OFF LAYERS OF DAMAGED AND SCARRED SKIN EVERY NIGHT. I only use it at night. In short_ the burning and irritation are worth it! My skin is velvety soft! So_ hang in there...it's worth it!!!,,F,43,6  weeks.05,7/23/2014Email,Tazorac

8, 5, mild to moderate acne,Mild itching_ redness_ skin flakiness.,After being plagued with moderate adult acne_ including painful cystic acne flares_ I finally went to my derm to be put on a regimen. She prescribed Solodyn 105mg daily_ Acanya mornings after cleansing and before moisturizing _and Tazorac 0.05% after cleansing and after moisturizing at night 3-4x a week and working up to every other night. After using Solodyn my breakouts_ including cystic flares reduced dramatically. After 1 month I started weaning off Solodyn and stopped it entirely 2 months after starting. All the while I continued using Tazorac at night_ every other night. After 2.5 months use_ skin had become clear_ bumps and scars smoothed out_ hyper pigmentation from past flares and pimples were minimized. And I had this glow. And everyone who hadn't seen me thought I had lost YEARS in age_ as it also is well-known for anti-aging affects.  Only minor irritations for me because_ I think Solodyn kept the initial purge effects in check. And I apply Neutrogena sensitive skin moisture before apply Tazorac_ only at night and only every other night. I had pretty bad Acne_ blotchiness_ dark spots in April when I started and by July_ little to no acne_ spots_ blotches_ bumps cleared up_ skin looked radiant and everyone was commenting on how young I looked. For me_ all three worked together_ but Tazorac I continue to use as maintenance. May not work for everyone_ but for me an absolute miracle.,M,34,5  months0.05% 4X W,9/22/2013Email,Tazorac

26, 5, Acne,Peeling_ Redness_ purging,Tazorac is taz-o-riffic. You may notice that I have only been on this medication for 1.5 weeks but that is just this time around. ( I will update this as the journey continues) When I was in junior high_ the derm. prescribed me Tazorac as a last step before accutane. This was actually before the cream had come out so my skin went through extreme peeling and purging. After the purging was complete_ I basically would have layers of skin falling off my face. I won't lie_ this was incredibly embarrassing in junior high but it didn't last forever. Initially I was using the gel every night but because of the peeling my derm. suggested I only put it on for 15 minutes then wash it off. This reduced the peeling and redness greatly and seemed to work great on my acne. When the cream came out_ I switched to that and was able to leave it on all night with little to no peeling. This stuff saved me. I survived the peeling_ redness_ and breakouts and returned in the 8th grade to people complementing me left and right. I literally had a girl run up to me to tell me how great my skin looked- Man_ that was awesome. I went off Tazorac because I was convinced it was having a bleaching effect on my face. I had a tan body and pale face.  I have never experienced acne so bad as I have been in the past 6 months. I went off birth control and my skin has had a hell of a time adjusting. I'm 23 now and perhaps this is Adult acne but it is painful_ huge_ and takes forever to go away. I have even missed c,F,23,1.5  weeks1% 1X D,8/23/2011Email,Tazorac
27, 5, Acne,I'm an aesthetician who has been on Tazorac 0.05 for about a year.  I use it every other night.  I have found that the key to success with Tazorac is combining it with the right skin care products.  I use Obagi Clenziderm Step 1 ( for oily skin with 2% salicylic acid) and Step 2 (Pore Therapy with 2% salicylic acid) twice a day along with my Tazorac 0.05 every other night.  What my saving grace has been is a product called Cicalfate by Avene.  Originally a post laser product_ Cicalfate is gentle enough to apply to bleeding_ oozing skin (sometimes caused by a CO2 laser treatment) and has soothed my skin nightly.  It really keeps the side effects of Tazorac at a next-to-nothing level.  Here's the kicker -- I'm a dry_ sensitive skin type who is very acne prone.  All of these products are strong but are very tolerable with the use of Cicalfate_ which by the way_ is pretty inexpensive.  Only $24 retail!  Good luck to everyone on Tazorac.

29, 4, Bad breakout,Bad initial break out_ greasy/oily skin,I've always had pimples here and there but a few months ago my skin turned it worse it has ever been. I was on differen prior to this that my doctor had gave me but this made my skin worse. So I went to the dermatologist and he prescribed tazorac to me. I'm also taking clindamycin and minocycline.  The 2nd week on this product I had the worse breakout I have ever had. I couldn't believe it and hated looking in the mirror! I was so discouraged so I called my doctor to tell him I was stopping the product. He told me that this is what the product is suppose to do and he told me to continue using it. So I did. And let me tell you it has actually been worth it. It has been about 7 weeks and my skin is so much better than before. My skin is finally starting to feel like it use to be. I do have a lot of scarring now because I picked but they will eventually fade or makeup works fine. But you have to be very patient with tazorac.

30, 3, Acne/Pore Minimizer,Dry Flakey Skin_ Very dry lips!,I started using this product back in November.  I have a friend who is 42 years old and has the most beautiful skin!  She uses a similar product called Retin A (I'm sure you've heard of it).  When I went to the derm_ she suggested I try the Taz.I have very large pores_ and have had mild to moderate acne since I was about 13.The moisturizer used first makes the product less harsh.  I started out using it_ as directed(pea sized amt) for the first 2 months_ about 3 times a week.My friend suggested I go full speed ahead and use it 5 days a week (minimum).  I thought she was nuts but at first_ I'm not gonna lie...it was rough.  My skin was blotchy_ flakey_ and not pretty.  I covered it as much as I could with makeup but sometimes that made it look worse.My suggestion is to wash your face at night_ put a small amt of moisturizer on (the suggestions here for Cereve are correct...it is a good moisturizer!).  Wait about 15 mins_ and then apply your pea sized amt of Taz.  I do this Monday night-Friday night.  I give myself a break Sat and Sun night.  I think my fine lines around my eyes are going away too.  People will suggest you stay away from the corners of your nose_ and the 'puppet lines' (the lines from the corners of your nose down to the corner of your lips)_ but these are the areas that need it to...so i say....suck it up and give it a chance.

31, 2, Acne,Burning_ itching_ peeling_ severe soreness (tenderness) of skin,I started using Tazorac on January 7th_ it is currently March 8th. Over all_ I'm not sure if I would recommend this drug. It hasn't did much to clear up my acne at all so far. I started by using BP pads on my face at night followed by a moisturizer and then the Taz. When I was doing this regime_ I didn't have any harsh side effects_ however_ I was getting absolutely no results either. Then_ I eliminated the moisturizer and was just applying the Taz after the BP pads. This actually started working better for my skin and I noticed the peeling but my acne was slightly getting better..minimally. However_ I've been doing this for about a week and a half now and my face hurts so bad! I can't touch my face without it burning and hurting really bad. I just washed my face and it was stinging so bad that I think I'm going to skip the Taz and BP pads tonight. I just applied a lot of moisturizer and hopefully it will feel better soon. I read that you should apply moisturizer before applying Taz and I also read that the moisturizer doesnt alter the effectiveness of the Taz but I'm not too sure if this is true. The Taz seemed to work so much better without the moisturizer_ maybe I just need to incorporate the moisturizer more into my routine. I'm not sure how to fix this_ I just know I've been using Tazorac for two months now_ my acne is still there and even a little worse_ my skin peels and my face hurts. ....not satisfied.,F,18,2  months0.05% 1X D,3/7/2011Email,Tazorac
32, 5, Acne,Redness_ Dry Flaky skin_ Irritation_ Burning,I have used Tazorac gel in the past_ applying it at night. It caused me severe burning and irritation. To cope with the dry and peeling skin I use Aveeno natuarlly radiant mosturizer with spf_ which works excellent and well worth the money. I also use Triaz foaming cloths both day and night before applying tazorac. I was never told to use a mosturizer before applying tazorac. I completed the process in about 5 months I used Triluma to get rid of the scaring. My face was flawless and I always received compliments. However_ I got lazy and stopped taking such great care of my face_ and my acne returned. I am currently going through the process once again and it has been four weeks and the improvements are drastic already.

For a while_ about three weeks in_ I noticed that things seemed to be improving_ but then I'd have phases of more breakouts. Right now I'm in one of those breakout phases that seems to be worse than before. So bad in fact that I actually made the decision to go on Proactive to see if that would work faster/better. I changed my mind after reading that I still may go through some of the same side effects as Tazorac. After reading everyone's comments on this forum_ I've decided to stick with Taz for at least another three weeks_ which is when I go back to the dermatologist to let her check my progress. This whole process is definitely about being patient_ even though I'm very self-conscious about my appearance right now and want something to fix it all NOW. I hope that Tazorac is worth the wait and stress. Besides_ Taz is more cost effective than Proactive and that's a very good thing. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories.

Drink:2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in half a cup of water. You can read online the amazing benefits for acne and just your health in general     Supplement: instead of taking so many medications for acne that are damaging your skin and overdosing it with chemicals I advice natural vitamins that help the skin.  Tumeric pills morning and night and Spirulina are amazing for acne and your body's health! You can also read their benefits online.,MORNING: 1.  use quarter size of jojoba oil and massage into the skin for 30 seconds this will soften peeling and combat dryness_ jojoba oil is also great for scars and acne in general. Hop into shower with jojoba oil on if you take a shower in the morning                   2. Wash with water_ there will be a film of jojoba oil still on skin.  At this point add your gentle cleanser and massage for another 30 seconds to wash away the oil.  If if still remains you can GENTLY massage with a washcloth.  This should wash away the jojoba oil                   3. Apply a thick layer of moisturizer and let it soak in before applying any makeupNIGHT   1. Same as morning #1 with jojoba oil.  Hop into the shower with jojoba oil still on if you take a shower at night               2. Apply gentle cleanser and massage very gently with washcloth or cleansing cloth to remove dirt and dry flaking skin.  DO NOT BE ROUGH.  Do this for 30 seconds and rise with warm water               3. dry face and wait 5 minutes and apply a pea size amount of tazorac to problem areas!! not areas that are completely fine because that will just irritate them for no reason.  After applying tazorac wait 1 minute for it to sink in and then apply a thick moisturizer.  Keep applying till the skin feels calm and not cracked and dry               4.

37, 4, Large pores_ blackheads_ acne,Mild redness_ moderate dryness_ irriatation when washing face/applying lotion,I have tried both strengths of retin a micro over the last 2 years with moderate effectiveness_ but my skin was still very oily.

I had enlarged pores on my cheeks_ and blackheads on my nose. My enlarged pores have shrunk & are nearly invisible now_ visibly less blackheads as well. My once oily skin is now actually dry_ so be prepared to use a good moisturizer. I never used a moisturizer even when on retin a micro.

38, 4, Moderate/Severe Acne,Some dry_ flaky skin,This medicine is great if you use with a moisturizer to counteract the side effects. I tried Tazorac cream a year ago_ but had to stop using it after a week_ my skin is sensitive and it was getting so red and irritated it was even kind of swelling. Recently_ my acne was getting more out of control so I started using it again 3 weeks ago. I bought Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer. It is a bit pricey ($15-$18) so I was hesitant to pay that much for a moisturizer_ but it is worth every penny. I use it every morning and at night_ 15 min before putting on Tazorac. It has cut the side effects down significantly. My face is just a bit flaky and drier in some areas_ but really not that bad. I am convinced that this moisturizer has saved me from most of those dreaded side effects. Probably the only way you will not be suffering from severe dry_ irritated skin. I know my skin is still supposed to flake somewhat before my acne can get any better so I?m just waiting for that 3 month mark to start seeing really clear skin_ but I?m very confident it will work because it already dries up my pustular acne after 1 night. Note about what make-up to use: If you are having problems with make-up looking horrible putting it on flaky skin_ try Maybelline SuperStay foundation. I have tried many department store and drugstore foundations and this is one that does not emphasize that flaky skin as much. Plus_ it looks super smooth on and doesn't settle into lines or wrinkles!

I give it a 5 because I know it works you just have to fight through it and my acne is about mild to severee within that range and ive had it for 5 years ive gone through many medications and this one is finally feeling like its working,M,17,1  weeks30 MG 1X D,10/30/2010,Tazorac

43, 4, acne,some redness of face_ not too much peeling..just a bit,after 3 months my skin is starting to get better. I had extremely oily skin and I think it is helping that as well. Less blemishes and less oil. i use Duac during the day and Taz at night w/o moisturizer sometimes. i am going to stick with it. I do have scars and i will see if this helps the scaring at all,F,62,3  months30mg 1X D,9/26/2010Email,Tazorac
44, 5, Acne on chin and forehead,Peeling_ redness_ brought a lot of deep acne to the surface.  Groups of pimples would form overnight.,I've never had terrible acne but I would still breakout_ or get a few pimples on a day to day basis.  MY skin was never 100% clear and I never knew if I would wake up with a random pimple_ especially on my chin.  Tazorac definitly made my skin far worse for two months.  It was terrible and embarassing but after EXACTLY two months my skin is far better and almost 100% clear_ with just a little scarring that will probably go away completely after continued use.  If you're experiencing side effects now and it's making you want to stop using the product I deifnitly reccommend staying with it for 2-3mnths.  I never used lotion before applying the tazorac_ and applied a pea size amount at night to all affected areas.,F,23,2  months.05 1X D,9/24/2010,Tazorac
45, 5, severe acne,peeling_ itchy_ dryness_ and redness,2 years ago I had severe acne. I cried all the time due to low self-esteem. My acne did get worst before I got better. However_ I do believe it just depends on the person's health_ history_ and skin in general. Tazorac was a miracle!! My face literally was so clear people thought I had on make-up_ and I didn't. Recently_ my face began breaking out again so I went back to the dermatologist and they prescribed me Tazorac since it worked a miracle in the past. My face isn't near as bad as it was 2 yrs ago before I used the product_ but I definitely believe it's not all that great now. I advise everyone who uses this product to continue using it whether your face gets worst or not. Believe it_ Tazorac truly works_ but the only way to find out is to actual go through with it. My suggestion is to put it only on the irrated areas_ put moisturizer ON TOP of it ONLY WHEN needed_ if peeling worsens_ apply it every other night_ and wash your face every morning and night with warm water and pat dry. I promise you_ Tozarac will not only change your face_ but it will change your life!!,F,21,2  years30 grams 1X D,9/19/2010,Tazorac
46, 2, acne,redness_ large pores_ dryness at night no positive results with my breakouts and acne scars the only difference is the texture of my skin; when i touch my face it feels soft and smooth except for the small pimples i still have or get.,i hope i see obvious results in the future....,F,18,1  months 1X D,9/19/2010Email,Tazorac
47, 5, acne anti aging,thinner skin  red spots peeling  brings deep acne to the surface,This product breaks out your face_ causes severe peeling_ flaky skin and then after a month the redness fades and you have glowing skin. The first week for me was a living Hell because of the huge deep zits on my chin. I also used finacea during the day and I use emu oil to moisurize. This moistrizer sinks in and stops the flakiness. I have not seen a change in wrinkles but the Taz has cleared up the deep cystic acne on my chin that was so deep and the bumps hurt. It is so wonderful to wake up with smooth skin. I can not wait to see results after 3 months. I also will be using a clarisonic brush to keep up with getting rid of the dead skin cells that taz exfoliates off. I am 59 and have finally got rid of the bumps along my chin which caused me to cry-I have never had acne except during my late 50's . The first weeks are very bad and makes you want to give up-my daughter did . Keep using it and do not give up.,F,59,2  months1% 1X D,9/12/2010,Tazorac

The redness has almost gone away_ but the itching and burning is medium to severe.,F,67,14  days 1X D,9/12/2010,Tazorac
49, 3, Cystic Acne,It is only day 5 and I am experiencing increase in oilyness and redness on the actual zits themselves. Getting worried that it is going to make my face worse! I too  have tried just about everything from Obaji (which worked amazing for about 4 years)_ proactive_ murad_ retin A_ acutane_ etc...and still here I am at 41 years of age having to deal with ACNE. I am a small business owner and am very embarrassed to meet with clients!,My derm has me washing my face 2x a day with Sodium Sulfacetmide 10% and Sulfur 5% cleanser_ waiting the recommended 30 min_ then mixing the tazorac with CeraVe together then applying. I am also taking Spirolactone as well...wish me luck!,F,41,5  days0.05% 1X D,8/18/2010Email,Tazorac
50, 3, acne,i've previously been on the tazorac gel and that stuff used to sting my face and make it all red_ dry and flaky but i didn't know that you were supposed to apply moisturizer prior to using the gel but i'm currently on the cream tazorac and have yet to experience any side effects (apart from my acne worsening in the first few weeks),i've been on tazorac (gel) before but i was so impatient that I gave up before hitting the 3 month mark; I recently went back to the dermatologist and was prescribed tazorac again but she stressed the fact that I needed to be patient and that i wouldn't see any sort of improvement for at least 12 weeks; it's been 6 six weeks and i think my skin is starting to slowly clear up. I had A LOT of bumps all over my face_ which got worse and i'm at that point where the really bad acne is starting to clear up and i'm sort of back to where i was before my face got worse b/c of the medication. I will post another review in six weeks to let people know if my skin actually does clear up.,F,18,6  weeksidk 1X D,8/14/2010,Tazorac

52, 1, acne,redness burning peeling.,DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE FAIR SENSITIVE SKIN! I used this product ONCE_ and had a horrible reaction. It started with red patches and now two days later the red patches grew till they covered my entire face. My skin is red and thick now with fine lines and peeling of the skin. It looks like I have a chemical burn. I hope it will subside soon? But doesn't look promising.,F,21,1  times30 mg 1X D,8/1/2010Email,Tazorac
53, 4, Moderate Cystic Acne,I started using the tazorac cream and it made my face look like an oil slick!  Also_ it dried out my face so bad (yep_ at the same time making it super oily) and my face hurt to touch and was super bright red. It peeled so bad I was embarrased to leave the house.  Not to mention_ my acne was never worse in my life during the first 3 months!!!  I looked like a joke!,The first 3 months were horrific!  My skin was red_ peeling_ acne-ridden_ and oily!  I was so upset and depressed about my face the first 3 months_ but was told that was the magic number of months to wait as far as results go.  Since my face was still gross after 3 months_ I asked my doctor to switch me to tazorac gel 0.1% and it started working better.  I think it must have been the mineral oil in the cream that made me sooooo greasy.  Anyway_ tazorac gel is working fine now.  I get a few deep cystic pimples now_ but not as bad as before.  I never touch my face_ clean it with Mary Kay cleanser for oily skin_ and clean my face 2 times per day.  I occasionally use toner and use Mary Kay moisturizer for oily skin.  I always apply the moisturizer 1 hour prior to using Taz at night to keep from horrible peeling.  I don't recommend skipping the moisturizer_ no matter how greasy you think your face is.  I also use Duac cream each morning.  This has been working for the past few months_ but isn't super affordable.  I've tried everything you can imagine Rx and OTC_ except for Accutane.  Not worth the side effects for me.  I hope this blog was useful to others struggling with acne.,F,35,7  months0.1% 1X D,7/6/2010Email,Tazorac

55, 2, Acne,Before stumbling upon this site I used this product for 2-3 days_ and stopped due to excessive peeling_ itching and burning of my skin.  Little did I know there was a solution to this problem.,I am 35 yo AA female and I've been cursed with acne for as long as I can remember. I've tried just about everything to help rid myself of acne_ and the horrible blemishes left behind due to my picking. My initial experience with taz was not very good_ I stopped using within 2-3 days. I am truly grateful for whoever created this website.  It has been very helpful in providing useful information on how to prevent the excessive peeling_ and burning of my skin. I re-started taz about a week ago after reading all of the postings.  It seems as though everyone has experienced pretty much the same symptoms_ which was good news to me b/c I thought it was just me. My daily regimen is wasing my face with Cetyphil at night_ apply moisturizer_ then the taz.  In the morning_ I just wash my face again and apply moisturizer. No more excessive peeling_ minimal itching_ and no burning.  I will admit my acne hasn't gotten any better_ as a matter of fact it's worse.  I will continue to use taz given the fact just about every posting states their acne got worse before it got better.  My biggest problem was the peeling_ and the burning of my skin_ which has been resolved.  Hopefully_ in the next 2-3 months I will have a wonderful success story to post about how wonderful my skin looks!,F,35,2  weeks0.1 Gel 1X D,6/11/2010Email,Tazorac
56, 5, Acne,Slight redness_ sun sensitivity_ skin appears slightly thinner.,Tazorac has worked extremely well. It took about 6 weeks for my skin to get used to the medicine and about 3-months before my skin cleared up completely. I use the cream at night after washing my face with Cetyphil facewash and applying Cetyphil mosturizer. The medicine keeps my face clear of pimples_ but I still have blackheads. My blackheads are really deep on my nose_ so maybe they will just take more time. I do have a question...does anyone know if it is safe to continue to use Tazorac for an extended period? I love this medicine_ and want to continue using it as long as it doesn't loose it effectiveness or build-up in my bloodsteam.,F,28,10  months.05 1X D,6/2/2010,Tazorac
57, 5, Severe Acne,Extreme dry skin_ peeling_ extreme sensitivity_ burning_ redness.,Tazorac literally changed my life. I had severe acne in Junior High_ and at that time_ all of my other friends had perfect skin_ so it was really embarrassing for me to look like that. I had no self esteem_ and I just felt ugly. I would always wear make up to cover it up_ and none of my other friends had to wear makeup! My dermotolagist prescribed Tazorac and for the first few weeks_ my skin was dry_ burning_ red_ and peeling_ it made everything look worse. My acne began to clear up a little bit_ but the side effects of Tazorac made things look 10 times worse. About 5 weeks later_ the side affects dissapeared and my acne did too. It was literally a miracle_ my skin looked amazing! Many times I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. I felt great and I finally began to think I was actually pretty. It worked amazing for me for about a year_ before I ran out again and I so from the on I just stopped using it_ and surprisingly my acne didn't come back for a very long time. Now I find myself in highschool_ and I've noticed my acne coming back so I've got a new presciption and I'm starting it again. The symptoms (redness_ dryness_ burning) are back but I can't wait to see my skin clear up again!,F,15,2  years 1X D,5/28/2010,Tazorac

I have scars & red marks all over my face.  I Did noticed that the pimples were drying up but the red marks are still there.  I just can't wait for everything to go away.,I'm using Tazorac every night and also use 'clindamycin' twice a day.

59, 5, sun damage & fine lines,Redness & drying_ some irritation. I have been using Tazorac for approximately 10 years. My dermatologist prescribed it to improve skin texture_ tone_ and color. He also prescribes Premarin Estrogen cream as a night moisturizer. I have been seeing this Dr. for 30 years now. I am now 60 years old and have the skin of much younger woman. Smooth and soft with very minimum fine lines. As a sun worshiper in my youth I was concerned about sun damage. Tazorac has removed it all_ even on my neck and arms. The estrogen cream has kept my skin supple and does not have that thinning skin we ladies get after menopause. Girls_ use this product & don't give up_ you will have wonderful benefits.,If it is too strong for you to use everyday. Start out with 1-2 times a week mixed in with your moisturizer.,F,60,10  years.1% 1X D,5/10/2010,Tazorac
