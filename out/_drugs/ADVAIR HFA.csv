1, 3, Athsma,muscle cramps,Helpful note: many times muscle craps are caused by lack of Potassium. But do you think your Doctor would tell you that you could buy a over the counter nutrient that could help....Is'nt it funny that many of the complaints have to do with muscle cramps and studys do show that this drug does sometimes zap potassium. when I asked my Doc. he said it was highy unlikely that thats the reason I was having cramps. So I stoped the meds and started potassium ...guess what_ feeling much better. Look into it. Potassium plays many roles including heart heath . also notice all the heart complaints here....All I can say is DUH! to the makers of this drug! I am not a Doctor and you should ask your doc. if this is right for you_ but this helped me good luck!,F,24,50  days 2X D,6/19/2011,Advair hfa
