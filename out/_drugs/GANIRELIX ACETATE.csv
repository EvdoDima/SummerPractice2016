0, 5, Infertility treatments,Little burning at time of injection_ but that quickly faded.,I did not ovulate early_ which was a huge plus the cycle I used this as my husband was out of town and we were using frozen sperm for an IUI. 39 weeks later we had a perfect 10 lb boy. Well_ he does have a hypospadeas_ but that occurs in 1 in 200 boys_ so it would be impossible to directly link it back to the meds. I know quite well correlation does not equal causation and will not be joining the ambulance chaser lawsuits that are becoming so popular.,F,30,4  days1 syringe 1X D,8/31/2011,Ganirelix acetate
1, 3, IVF,Initially when I took the drug my greatest side effect was lots of fatigue and bloating. It also made me feel bad_ in a strange way_ not physically but emotionally_ it's hard to describe and I never felt this way before or after_ but I felt really bad. My doctor had me take 2 shots at the same time for 5 days.  Ugh...,My baby had torticolis and a flat spot on the skull at birth.  This is listed on the package insert as a possible side effect.  I wish I had read the package insert before taking this drug because I would have probably asked for something else.  He had a cranial helmut to help correct the problem.  It cost thousands and wasn't covered by insurance.  Out of curiosity I started asking others in the waiting room if they had IVF babies.  Most were...at least at this clinic...interesting...  Fortunately we were able to correct the problem_ at our expense of course.  It was very difficult financially and we had to set up a payment plan.,F,40,5  days 1X D,12/24/2010,Ganirelix acetate
