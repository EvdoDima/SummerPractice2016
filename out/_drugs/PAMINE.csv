0, 1, For IBS,Made me so drowsy I could not take it during the day if I needed to be alert and had to concentrate on driving.  Almost nodded off just while sitting on the loveseat one afternoon after taking it.  Made vison kind of blurry and hard to focus.  Also_ after taking several times I got urine hesitancy---it was just hard to urinate whe I got the urge. Also my urine had a strange odor to it after taking the pamine.  I was hesitant to continue taking it as well when I learned it decreases sweat/perspiration and our summer temps were over 100 degrees.  Some of the side effects listed for Pamine included constipation and bloating too---the very things I was hoping to GET RID OFF that were caused by IBS.  Will not continue to take this medication.,,F,59,7  days2.5mg 2X D,8/7/2011Email,Pamine
1, 5, IBS,I don't sweat much on it_ so I have to watch that I don't exert myself on hot days.,I take on dose in the morning_ and I am good for the day.  It slows things down enough that by the time the one dose (supposed to take it every 12 hours) I take a day wears off_ I have normal movements -- for the first time I can remember!,F,25,1  years,8/22/2008,Pamine
2, 1, severe  stomach cramps,my body functions stoped working and i was sick enough to dieafter 3 doses in 3 days.,my stomach cramps were gone and my husband started giving me grape juice_ apple juice and whatever liquid he could get down me. I was very weak but he wouldn't let me die_ he thought i was going to_ and wrote down the children's phone numbers_ so he could call them.,F,85,3  days,7/16/2008,Pamine
3, 5, colon spasms,The first few days_ I experienced some confusion and had a hard time working.  I reduced my dosage and instead of taking it on an empty stomach 30 minutes before_ I acutally take it at the same time that I eat.  That seemed to cure the confusion.  I do experience dry mouth_ and my eyes are very sensitive to the light but chewing gum and wearing sunglasses is better than being in pain after I eat.  I've been able to eat for over a year now anything I want and as much as I want pain free and without having to make a mad dash to the bathroom every time I ate.  I suffered 10 years with IBS and Pamine has given my life back.  I can now go out and eat_ watch a movie_ travel_ and not have to know where the next restroom is or how long the pain would last.  Thank you Pamine!  Lisa,,F,37,1.5  years,1/23/2006Email,Pamine
4, 2, IBS-D,Always Stomach upset_ Always Nausea_ Never Ending Headache_ Sometimes Dizziness_ Always Drowsiness_ Extremely Dry Mouth_ Dry Nose.,I took this for IBS-D to prevent attacks and it actually triggered my attacks.  I took it for a week and couldn't handle it anymore.  Not satisfied!  I'm on Levbid now and it works much better!,F,30,1  days,1/1/2006Email,Pamine
5, 5, Esophagael spasams,,I have had esophageal spasms for a long time.  Feels just like a heart attack. I have ended up in the ER several times with it because I also have heart problems and it's tough to tell the difference so they have to run tests to make sure it's not my heart. A doctor gave me a few samples of Pamine to try and I guess it soothes the spasms.  When I take one Pamine the pain is relieved within minutes and I know it's not my heart.  Has saved me several trips to the ER and I haven't had any side effects.  I only take one when I have these attacks.,M,57, ,7/8/2005,Pamine
