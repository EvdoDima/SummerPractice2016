0, 1, Hyperuricemia,Though I had just one gout attack about 4 years ago_ my uric acid levels in the last three years have run between 7.8and 10.5.  I had been taking Allopurinol with iffy results.  Immediately after starting Uloric I experienced systemic arthritic pain_ both shoulders_ hands_ wrists_ both hips_ left knee_ and the pain increased daily.  I contacted my physician's office and got the okay to discontinue use.  After three weeks off this medication I am still experiencing strong pain_ though nothing that resembles an actual gout attack.  I have CHF and have also experienced an increase in chest pain.  This is not a good medication for me.,,F,68,8  days40 mg 1X D,9/20/2013Email,Uloric
1, 5, tophaceous gout,none,I changed my rheumatologist because I felt my gout was not adequately controlled_ especially when I started developing tophi on my hands.  My new Dr. put me on Uloric.  After 3 days of taking Uloric my uric acid was 3.2.  18 days after that_ it was down to 2.9.  My uric acid tends to run above 10.  Even probenecid was not having an effect.  I couldn't take allopurinol because it raised my liver enzymes.  I also notice that it appears the size of some my tophi are diminishing.  Overall I'm content with the fast improvement.,F,55,22  days40 mg 1X D,10/10/2012Email,Uloric
2, 1, gout,During the two and a half months I took this drug_ I had more gout attacks (5) than ever before. Before using this drug_ I might have had a gout attack every two months at the most. I used my colchicine to combat the attacks_ but then_ thats what I did before so I stopped taking it. I'm going to try something else.,,M,65,80  days40 1X D,7/20/2010,Uloric
3, 5, gout,none,Lowered my UA from 9.1 to 4.4 in 2 weeks. 40 mg/day.  Allopurinol is cheaper and been around longer- works great for most people; I happened to be allergic to it.  If you need help with gout_ go to gout-pal.com. they are not selling anything just a forum of fellow gout sufferers with outstanding advice.,M,44,4  weeks,1/30/2010,Uloric
