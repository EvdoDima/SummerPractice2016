0, 1, Asthma flare up from getting blasto,Mkes it harder to breathe for 30 minutes after taking it. Getting worse and doctor wants to put me back on prednisolone again. I notice that if i use ventolin I dont get better. If i take just the steroid I get better within a couple of weeks. Symbicort keeps me illand going downhill,,M,58,2  months,7/31/2016Email,Symbicort
1, 1, COPD,Started on 160 and after heart palpitations dose reduced to 80.4 BID.  The medication gave me tremors_ slight weight gain_ moon face_ and excess sputum production.  Leg cramps were horrible and every physician I questioned had no suggestions to relieve them.  After 4 horrible years on it I asked my pulmonologist to get me off Symbicort and  was recently prescribed Anoro.  This works much better for me and I am glad to be off the steroids.  Haven't used a rescue inhaler since changing medication.,,F,65,4  years80.4 2X D,7/18/2016,Symbicort

3, 5, COPD_ Pulm. Sarc._  Bronchiectasis,Since on Symbicort I've only experienced hoarseness. This is an extremely minor thing compared to not being able to breath properly.,I was hesitant about starting this inhaler because of the black box warning.

4, 5, breathing well controlled,hoarseness_ bruising.,Advair did not work well for me. I constantly had to run inhaler under water to get it unplugged. I was thrilled when my insurance switched me to Symbicort. I breathe better and use my rescue inhaler less often. I also use Synthroid for hypo_ which I had previous to using any steroid inhaler. It has not affected my thyroid or dosage in the slightest. The benefits outweigh my side effects.,F,44,2  years160 2X D,4/23/2016,Symbicort
5, 2, Asthma,I took Advair for years and loved it. My insurance made me switch to Symbicort because it was cheaper and they required that I failed on Symbicort before they would pay for Advair. I have had to use my rescue inhaler more frequently on Symbicort_ I'm experiencing an irregular heart beat and worsening of msk pain. I've also gained 20 pounds and my thyroid has gone from normal to hypo. I stopped taking it this week and am hoping to see some of the negative symptoms subside.,I've had lifelong asthma and know how to manage it well with meds.  Not a fan of symbicort. It's cheaper than advair by half_ but I have to take 4xs as much to get an affect and the side affects are far worse.,F,41,9  months 2X D,4/6/2016,Symbicort

8, 1, As a preventative asthma pump,Heart palpitations which caused dizziness_ shortness of breath_ chest discomfort and mood is low.,I have had asthma all my life. I've always been on the pumps and most recently I was on seretide 250 which I was perfectly happy with. On a routine asthma check they decided to move me to symbicort_ obviously I asked them why because I was happy. They showed me a little medical book that belongs to them. Seretide cost something like ?65_ symbicort ?7.50. I appreciated their honesty and gave it a go_ but the difference in price is shown through how horrible a drug this is. I've never had problems ever with any asthma pump or with my health_ yet this week I've seen the doctor twice and also went to a&e through these absolutely horrible side effects. I could barely walk let alone jog without the heart palpitations stopping me in my tracks and it alarmed me. I'm fit yet I'm worried to do anything at the moment. Obviously I'm off it now and have been for 4 days_ I'm still getting symptoms so I'm hoping it's working it's way out of my body. It's a horrible cheap drug and I would NOT recommend it.,F,35,2  weeks200,3/18/2016,Symbicort

24, 1, Wheezing_ and shortness of breath,My doctor prescribed this to me after me thinking for 2 weeks back in the beginning of Nov. I was having my normal allergy symptoms. Then I started having shortness of breath and wheezing. She diagnosed me with Bronchitis_ and put me on Zythromax and Prednisone. That didn't help_ and I developed a slight cough. I just realized today that it has been this medication that was causing me to begin itching_ and breaking out in hives after using it(2 puffs 2x dly). Also began experiencing leg cramps about 5 days ago_ stomach bloating and cramping_ elevated blood pressure from day 1 (already on meds) which was controlled_ AND I've gained about 5 lbs!!,My symptoms have not gotten better although_ they have not worsened. I'm a singer_ and I'm unable to hit my notes. My singing_ and speaking voice is very raspy and sometimes I can barely talk. This was occurring BEFORE the Symbicort_ but I thought it would help clear it up. I'm waiting to call my doctor on Monday_ but will not be using this medication anymore!

26, 1, asthma,For the first two weeks I was able to breathe with the Symbicort product very well.  Then I began to develop mucus and coughing_ which caused breathing to become more difficult then before I used the product.  I was not advised that you could not quit this product cold turkey.  When I did stop using it abruptly_ my breathing was completely shut down.  I almost passed out. I was able to get to my rescue inhaler_ which saved me.  I had to use the rescue inhaler every hour then every two hours just to be able to breathe.  This is not shortness of breath I am talking about.  I could not breathe.  After a few weeks of stopping Symbicort I developed allergies.  Especially food allergies.  I had asthma attacks over practically every thing I ate.  I lost 35   pounds in just a few months because I could not breathe after eating with out reacting severely.

27, 3, Asthma,* Eye's have a harder time adjusting to small print or pictures close to the face and overall slowed eye lens adjustment and reaction time.* Bloating and/or weight gain noticeably in the stomach and face areas of the body. * Occasional painful muscle cramps and/or contortions in the chest (when stretching)_ legs_ fingers/toes.* Lethargy. * Occasional headaches.* Excessive coughing up of phlegm in the morning upon waking.,This medicine does work in regards to relieving serious asthmatic breathing symptoms for long periods of time (12-24hrs). However_ one needs to be aware that there are side effects that come along with the product and may vary from person to person with some overall similarities. Noticeable weight gain is an issue and one cannot eat their previous normal caloric intake without gaining weight. The only way around this is to eat less caloric dense food and focus more on foods that have a higher nutritional value. Minimize or eliminate processed foods_ simple carbs_ sugars and other additives. I've had to go with eating only one large meal a day_ with a smaller 2nd meal or snacks throughout the day to refrain from gaining too much weight. I also drink an energy drink in the morning with fresh squeezed lemon/lime juice to wake me up from the lethargy this medicine brings upon you (I don't like coffee and consume one of the various pre-exercise energy powder products on the market_ this does the trick for me). I don't eat out much and cook all my own food at home to monitor exactly what and how much I'm eating. If you continue to eat like you did previous to using this medicine you will gain serious weight_ i.e. 3 meals a day_ not paying attention to where and what food is being eaten_ etc. Maintaining some kind of exercise routine and a healthy lifestyle is a must on this medicine as it will slowly ruin other parts of your health while allowing you to breathe normally,M,41,2  years80mcg 1X D,11/15/2015Email,Symbicort

Just called the on call nurse to see if I need to go to the ER. And I was not too bad this morning  prior to today's dose. I wanted to see how I did without it. Well I am definitely worse with it.
