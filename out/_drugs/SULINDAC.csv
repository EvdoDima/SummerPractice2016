0, 3, arthritis,nausea_ heartburn_ nosebleed,It was helping me despite the very low dose_ but after a week the nausea became worse and I had to discontinue. I am sensitive to medication; it may help others.,F,58,7  days150 1X D,4/10/2010,Sulindac
1, 3, Rotator cuff injury,This drug appears to have raised my pulse rate_ both resting_ and while exercising. It's usually around 75 while at rest_ but it's more like 95 now. Also_ my max heart rate while doing aerobic exercise has increased by approx. 10 bpm (175 vs. 165.Also_ (I hope this isn't too much information!)my stool is turning yellow_ which concerns me about my liver function. Yes_ the pills are yellow_ but they seem very small to be having that effect. If I end up having to take this medication for more than a month_ I will ask for a liver function blood test.,I was diagnosed via MRI with a full thickness rotator cuff tear (no surgery yet_ but the probability is likely).Although this medication did offer relief to the acute pain after my injury_ I am very concerned by the warnings that come with this drug. The following are quotes from an information pamphlet given to me by the prescribing Dr.:1. The risk of Serious and sometimes fatal heart problems_ heart attack and stroke may be increased with use of this medicine.2. Risk of serious and sometimes fatal stomach and bowel problems (bleeding and holes in the stomach/bowel)is increased while using this medicine.,M,56,21  days150 mg 2X D,3/7/2010Email,Sulindac
2, 4, osteoarthritis,none,It's a lifesaver for me. I have jaw_ knee_ and hand pain_ and for me it's the difference between feeling like the tinman without oil vs. the tinman with oil. I worry what it's doing to my liver - I don't like being dependent on medication - but the help it gives me overrides the concern.,F,54,7  years,11/29/2007,Sulindac
3, 4, arthritis,None however my doctor said I needed to stop because of my Lap Band_ which is a weight loss device.  He said this medicine would cause errosion to my band and stomach.,While taking this medicine I still had arthritis aches and pains but when I stopped taking it_ my back got so stiff that I could not bend until about 4 hours after waking and then again late in the day it would get stiff again.  These are typical arthritis signs.  I didn't notice how well the drug worked until I had to get off of it.  Was off a week before stiffness came about_ was off another 5 days and I HAVE to go back.  OTC meds do not work the same.,F,52,1  years,11/12/2007Email,Sulindac
4, 3, Rheumatoid arhtritis,,worked for the first month and quickly lost it's effectiveness,F,31,2  months,7/6/2005,Sulindac
