0, 5, chronic constipation,none,"Doctor told me to start at 30 ml. and gradually increase dosage by 5 ml. every three days until ""your bowel movement becomes so powerful that you cannot under any circumstances ignore or avoid a daily bowel movement.""  He added_ ""You really can't overdose on lactulose because any excess amount is just expelled.  Take with breakfast.""At first_ all it produced was a gurgling effect in my stomach about noon.  As the dosage increased_ my constipation decreased and my bowel movements become easier. But_ at the same time_ I developed pungent and voluminous flatulence that I had to control to avoid social embarrassment.  At the above dosage_ there is a feeling of a hot bowel movement pushed out by gas and bloating.  You can ignore it for a while if you want to_ but eventually the urge becomes such that you can think of little else.  Finally_ panic sets in and you must find a bathroom quickly because there really is no alternative.",M,66, 150 ml 1X D,6/23/2010,Chronulac
