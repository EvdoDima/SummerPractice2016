8, 1, bipolar depression with anxiety,Weight gain was(30Lbs)_ sweating_ memory loss,I started taking it in 2004. At first I hated the sweating and weight gain. After awhile I learned to cope with it and my anxiety was about 80% gone. My depression disappeared. It seemed as though I was never bipolar and I was textbook bipolar!. I was able to cope with even with an abusive partner. The issue is you cope too well. You become desensitized to everything. Nothing  feels normal. You just go through the motions of life. I didn't think of my children's needs or emotions because I had none. I weened off after 5yrs of taking it. Stepped down from 60 to 30mg then off. I did take prozac while weening. I was off for two months and asked to be put back on it after all my bipolar symptoms resumed. I took it and was back to normal except I had anxiety. Now after being on it for almost 16yrs I weened off again with prozac. I've been off cymbalta for 3 months. Still on 40mg of prozac_ but hope to wean off that_ too. The reason I wanted off is memory loss. Forgetting words_ there meanings and how to pronounce them. Driving and not knowing where I'm headed after a few minutes. Not able to enjoy sex. Just loss of feelings. After 3 months off I'm still without memories from the past_ have issues remembering the date_ names_ recipes_ appointments_ to thaw something for dinner. It's impossible to remember my meds or appointments. I don't have signs of depression but am on 40mg of Prozac. I just want to remember.,F,40,16  years90 1X D,6/20/2016Email,Cymbalta
9, 1, PTSD Symptoms,After 4 1/2 years on Cymbalta(30mg)_ and still dealing with Depression from PTSD_ I had a 24 hr psychosis event and ended up in the emergency room. My doctor then thought it best to bump my dosage to 60 mg. That extra 30mg of Cymbalta _ almost was the last nail in my coffin. Within a few months I was always irritable and angry verbally abusive to my family. My anxiety was on full blast and I couldn't turn it off_ causing tremors and restless legs. I slept 3 to 4 days a week_ and I had extreme depression. I had migraines and lived in a fog and couldn't even comprehend basic responsibilities _ like paying my bills or working my cell phone. I showed paranoia symptoms and my blood pressure would raise or drop at any given moment_ I was often dizzy or light headed_ probably from the raising and falling of my blood pressure. My heart would beat rapidly  much of the time_ and my sleep patterns way off. Because many of these symptoms resembled extreme PTSD symptoms and my VA doctor so many mil,I am experiencing residue side effect_ after a few months without Cymbalta_ mostly in tremors and restless legs.

I've had headaches since I stopped -I am not sure if it's due to the Cymbalta withdraw or maybe its a long term side effect? but I don't know what else would be causing them_ since I eat very healthly and do a lot to avoid anything that can cause cancer.  my primary doctor said ulcers can cause headaches?-so I'm seeing a specialist to see if that gets rid of the headaches?Cymbalta definitely worked for depression_ not sure about fibro pain.

After seeing every type of doctor AND having every type of blood test/urine test/a fat biopsy about the swelling and itching rash on the inside of my knees and what started on the inside of my ankles. I have FINALLY figured out that I am having an extreme allergic reaction to Cymbalta. It also landed me into the ER as my upper lip swelled up after a nap one day. I was then put on Prednisone 20 mg a day to subdue the swelling and rash/itching. After putting on even a lot more weight because of the combination of the Cymbalta AND Prednisone_ I have plans for stomach surgery within the next 2 months. I started investigating/researching Cymbalta and I noticed a common denominator. EVERY site I went to mentioned as a ""Severe reaction to Cymbalta"" ALL of my symptoms. I had an appt today with my doctor that prescribed the Cymbalta and I tried multiple times to advise him of all of the websites I checked_ EVEN THE FDA.GOV_ they all said the same symptoms.  HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT I WAS NOT ALLERGIC TO THE ACTUAL MEDICINE_ IT WAS THE DYE IN THE CAPSULES I WAS ALLERGIC TO! After going through the entire endocrine system_ ie: do you have diabetes_ etc. He decided to change me back to Pristiq.  i quit taking the Cymbalta 3 days ago and I was able to titer myself off the Prednisone and my rash_itching and swelling is so much worse than ever!",F,47,1  years120mg 1X D,5/13/2016Email,Cymbalta

I had to go to an optometrist a couple days later due to seeing color bands out of the corner of my eyes when looking to either side and floaters appeared also.

In fact I am worse because this drug_ like most serotonin dominant drugs_ saps what little motivation I have left. I just have no interest or desire to do anything and this is much worse than before starting. The drug also failed to alleviate my bad memory and other cognitive impairment problems.

More like my brain was turned into ultra fine steel wool and I could hear and feel my steps at times. I could hear my eyes blink_ or a squishy sound in my ears (like someone squeezing steel wool inside my ears). The sounds came along with the ""mild electric jolt"" feeling too_ from toes to head often. Generic form I have are 6 small white pills inside the blue and white capsule. Dropped from 60mg to 30mg for several weeks. Then began removing 3 of the small white pills to take 15mg for a few weeks.

45, 5, Fibromyalgia,None known.,Tried to see if I could get off of drug_ but found that my foot pain was so bad that I could barely function.

49, 3, Major Depression,Not sure if side effects were from this medicine or others (Niasin and Zetia for high cholesterol)_ but I had dry mouth.  I was still depressed_ and I don't know if it was working. When I forgot to take a dose on time_ I had nausea.,I went through a difficult divorce and had a lot of other big changes in my life (moving to different house_ starting a new business_ money issues)_ but I was still very depressed so I didn't think meds were helping.  I stopped taking Cymbalta when I had skipped a dose and was too busy to deal with the nausea.  I didn't really intend to stop taking it_ but I didn't want to deal with the nausea so I just never took it again.  Didn't notice any difference for at least a month.  But then I went through more stress_ moved again_ downsized my business_ had staffing problems_ no family or close friends nearby_ etc.  Two months after stopping med_ I had extreme memory and disorientation problems.  That is getting better because I don't have as much on my mind now_ but I can't concentrate_ am very lonely and depressed and confused.  I have a lot of bad crying jags and feelings of homelessness and fear of the future.  I might go back on it_ but when I moved 4 months ago_ I never finished unpacking and now I can't find my meds so I would need to get a new prescription_ but it is so hard to get an apt to see a Dr.  I am just generally confused and can't make decisions.  I feel like there is no one I can depend on_ and no one would notice if I disappeared.,F,58,3  years60 mg 1X D,1/5/2016,Cymbalta
50, 1, Fibromyalgia,"The amount of pain this offset over the years is not worth the horrible side affects of trying to stop taking it.  Its been over 3 weeks of feeling like my head is inflating and deflating_ my eyes feel like they are spinning.  I have the dreaded ""brain zaps"".  I alternate between rage_ depression and crying my eyes out.  I have trouble concentrating and my ears are ringing.  My short term memory has failed.  I can barely drive.  I tried decreasing my dose for a week and the side affects hit me full on_ so not wanting to extend this for longer_ I stopped entirely.  I am worried about keeping my job_ my relationship and my sanity (maybe even my life).  From other patient experiences_ it seems this could go on for weeks.  The manufacturer should be honest when you start taking the drug about how severe this withdrawal can be and what percentage of individuals have these symptoms.  They also need to research how they can help people get off of it_ maybe a step down package of 10",,F,49,4  years60 MG 1X D,12/29/2015,Cymbalta
51, 5, Nerve_joint_PTSD post car crash,Have had some dry mouth/throat but no other side effects.,This medicine has helped TREMENDOUSLY. I was rear-ended while parked and had numberous fractures_ spine damage_ nerve damage_ and severe PTSD. My dr put me on neurontin first but I ended up in the ER. Second day of neurontin_ my vision became so blurry I could not see and my blood pressure was off the charts. I was very worried about more nasty side effects with cymbalta. As far as I'm concerned_ this medicine is a Godsend. After about 5 days_ I felt the best I've been since my car accident six months ago. It's expensive but for me it's awesome!,F,38,2  weeks60,12/26/2015Email,Cymbalta

Caused blurry vision - by day four_ I was unable to drive my car or read a letter because my vision was so blurry.,Didn't work as well as Lyrica on the nerve damage pain. Helped with anxiety only because it knocks you out and puts you into a zombie-like state. But the worst part was the vision changes - made it completely unsafe to drive.

56, 3, ,Swollen abdomen_ yellowish tint to the eyes_ painful liver_ lethargic,Although cymbalta work wonderfully for my depression in the beginning I began having some terrible symptoms about a year ago. I suddenly developed a slight yellowish tint to my eyes. I went to my gastroenterologist who did my annual colorectal and endoscopy exam. He discovered that I had a cyst on my liver. Although I had told him I had pain in my liver he told me I should not have any pain. The pain got worse. I had more test through my PCP who uncovered horses and lesions through a cat scan with contrast. Thank God I had the good sense to do some research. I called my psychiatrist who she said Cymbalta could cause those problems. I had begun to run out of the prescription_ fortunately_ so I stopped taking it all together. The majority of the symptoms have stopped. My Distended stomach has decreased_ painful liver is nearly gone_ yellowish tint of eyes has decreased_ I have also lost weight since I stopped taking it and I am NOT lethargic. My mood has been uplifted since stopping the Cymbalta.,F,63,10  years60 mg 2x d,12/8/2015,Cymbalta
