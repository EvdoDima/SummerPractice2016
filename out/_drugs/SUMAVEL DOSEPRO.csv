0, 5, Acute Migraine,Pain at injection site_ with a little bleeding.  That's it.,I'd had a migraine for days. Nothing was working for me. I finally remembered I had a sample of this. It was 2:30am_ and thank God!  By 2:45_ my days long migraine was GONE! That's huge. I thought triptans weren't helpful for me. At least for now_ I have something new to attack my migraines with and I'm feeling more hopeful.,F,42,1  days60mg,4/16/2015Email,Sumavel dosepro
1, 5, Sudden or ongoing migraine headache,The shot is painful.  Usually gives me a slight bruise and bleeds a bit.  I immediately press on it and put on a BandAid.  I get a small hive at injection site. Usually works on about 20 minutes but can take longer at other times.,,F,39,2  years1 shot,10/29/2012,Sumavel dosepro
2, 5, Chronic migraines,"Painful injection which causes swelling and a bruise.  Have a quick ""adrenalin"" type rush feeling immediately.  Migraine usually goes away within minutes.  Amazing drug for sudden_ intense migraine.",,F,38,1  daysDosePro,2/24/2012,Sumavel dosepro
3, 5, migraine,holy crap that stung lol. I watched a short demo video on the product and it said it was like a bee sting. yea maybe a big giant bee lol. outside of that the side effects are similar to sumatriptan. For me they are very mild flush feeling with maybe a quick cold sweat and moment of light nausea. most are barley noticeable.,Worked great and is the fastest relief i have used yet. Sumatriptan seems to take a few hours to kick in for me but these work in about a half hour or less. I dont use these regularly but had my doc right me a one month script of six just so i have them on hand for those times i really need relief fast. Paid for them out of pocket so as not to disrupt my regular script with my ins company_ now THAT hurt lol.,M,45,1  days6mg 1X D,11/14/2011Email,Sumavel dosepro
4, 5, Migraine,Stinging at injection site is fairly intense_ but only lasts a minute or so. Welt raises up from injection. Floaty_ weak feeling lasts maybe 15-20 min.,Under most circumstances_ headaches are gone within 20-30 minutes.  This medicine has been a godsend!  On one occasion where I didn't use the medicine until my headache was so bad that I was already vomiting_ it took 2 injections to get it under control.,F,50,6  months6 mg.x1d 1X D,9/18/2011Email,Sumavel dosepro
