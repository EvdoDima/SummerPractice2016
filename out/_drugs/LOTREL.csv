0, 1, High blood pressure,Coughing uncontrollably,After reading many blogs_ I told my doctor that Lotrel could be the reason I'm coughing. I have been to see a Pulmonologist to see if I had asthma_ did not. Next I'm supposed to see an allergist. If the change of medicine works_ I don't need to go.,F,60,4  months5MG,7/17/2016,Lotrel
1, 3, HBP,Been taking for just a few days when wife asked why I'm huffing and puffing after my brief morning work out. Then today was short of breath after bagging 2 loads of cut grass. Dizzy too.,Reduced BP from 140/90 to 128/88. Not worth side effects. Stopping it today. Will try to post follow-up.,M,55,7  days5/10 1X D,5/22/2016Email,Lotrel
2, 2, To lower my blood pressure,"Frequent peeing in the wee hours of the morning (this makes me alive at work let me tell you). That expression should be ""the pee hours of the morning."" If I completely empty my bladder_ why am I doing the same thing an hour later. Screw that. Weight gain (I never had two chins before). Blurred vision.  Erections not like they used to be and sex drive is blah. A little coughing. Swelled lower calves/ankles. This medicine is not for me.  I am a different person on it.  Time to try a different approach.  When my Dr. told me_ you may have to be on this medicine the rest of your life_ that did not sit well with me. I wanted to pour antifreeze down his mouth and see how he likes it. Most medicines are poisons and are toxic. But the amounts are so low they hopefully won't kill you and perhaps may have a positive effect.","I am very concerned about the long term effects (and_ of course_ the side effects).What good is controlling your blood pressure if Renal Failure is a possibility. That is scary.  I have been taking the generic version Amlodipine Benazepril 5-20 dosage. I started on 5-10_ then my Dr. increased it 'cause it was not working. I should have stopped him right there.  This medicine scares me and though it worked initially_ it no longer works. So why take something that makes you feel like crap and can possibly kill you if there are no benefits. At first I liked this drug_ I thought it was working for me_ but then it stopped and my BP is the same now as when I went on it.  Around 140/90_ sometimes 150/100. I am going to try supplements_ diet_ and exercise.  I guess you can say I tried to take the easy way out.  Well_ that did not work for me and my daily fear of what this medicine is doing to my body is not helping. What really pisses my off is there is not much information on how to properly go off of this medication. I always find this ""Consult your Physician before going off of this Medicine.""  Why_ so he can put me on another drug and keep my body dependent on these horrible drugs. I don't think so. What also bothers me is you have to see your Dr. to get the drug prescription renewed after a while. What kind of money making scheme is this? Sorry_ not me. I go online for advice now_ and I go to the Dr. for regular milestone checkups or if I am sick. I have an accurate BP",M,48,2  years5/20 1X D,7/24/2015Email,Lotrel

4, 4, HBP,Dry nagging tickly cough and no energy,Lotrel lowered my blood pressure to normal. Before Lotrel my blood pressure was spiking to stroke levels and beyond. It has controlled my blood pressure but this nagging cough is ridiculous. The cough developed within a week of taking it. And I have no energy at all.

Insomnia.,When I first went on this medication_ I asked my doctor if there were any side effects I should be concerned about.  He said it was a newer drug_ so there weren't any listed.  Wish I had been better about listening to my body back then.  This stuff is terrible.  My husband was on it for 20 years also.  He developed a terrible cough and pain in his feet and kidney issues.  The doctor prescribed more drugs.  Today_ he's dead.  I will do whatever I can to get off this junk.

Itching and rashes.Respiratory problems Sometimes blurry vision Funny taste in mouth_ indigestion_ nausea  and funny feeling in my chest. Hurts when I cough_ and  tired all the time.,I was on Lotrel 5/10MG for 10 years. First I was taking the Brand name_ and the longer I took it_ I had problems which I_ at the time did not know this medicine was causing this.  Had respiratory problems so bad that I was on steroids for 2/12 years_ causing me to gain a tremendous amount of weight.  Things went from bad to worst when I started taking the generic brand. I took another HP med for a short time and it caused similar side effects_ but my feet were not hurting.  Since I started taking Lotrel again_ my feet are burning and hurting enough to interfere with my walking.  I am opting for a more healthy lifestyle so that I can come off this poison_ as these medicines seem to have similar_ deadly side effects.

9, 2, Due to high blood pressure,I was taking the medicine before bed time. Though it lowered my BP_ it also lowered my HR. It would average around 52-55. It has gone as low as 48. And I am not one of those athletic types with a low HR.My chest felt weird and I was terrified to fall asleep. I wpuld stay up until I could not stay awake any longer.I finally did not take it last night and slept well. I then took my dose in the morning and made me feel so lethargic.

15, 1, HBP,I was an extremely healthy person w/controlled HBP for 3yrs while taking Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25 & Norvasc 5 - until my Ins Co 'Recommended' I switch my Norvasc to Lotrel 'because they were the same drug'_ & that my Norvasc co-pay was going up to $50 & Lotrel would only be $25; & they thru in a coupon for a FREE month. After ~10 days of my Lis/HCTZ 20/25 & my Lotrel 5/40_ I collapsed & nearly died. At the ER my BP was 56/48_ 3hrs later & a BP of 76/58 I was sent home & told I was overmedicated & said I should be fine by the next day. I wish. Each day I started experiencing a different problem_ & now have brain damage w/chronic neuro & endocrine issues. EVERY side effect that people have mentioned here_ & was listed as a rare possible side effect_ I have; & like many others have said_ even after a couple days I kept feeling like the drug was still in me. I haven't been able to work since & am considered permanently disabled. That was,Amazing how much has & is still_ coming out now about Lotrel & its serious side effects. What's more disturbing is the fact that the FDA had previously reprimanded Novartis 3 x's for advertising that Lotrel was a safer alternative to Norvasc & w/very few documented cases of problems; & if you happen to OD_ you'd only experience Hypotension. Have you seen the recent product info? I along w/so many others have unpredictable issues on a daily basis that my Dr's can't  explain. From chronic migraines & nausea; GI vision_ heart_ hormone_ thyroid & endocrine issues; to rt side tremors_ swelling & pain in my feet & extreme fatigue.

It made me so fatigued and lethargic_ I simply did not have the strength/desire for any activity.  My marriage suffered because I was suddenly accused of being lazy_ which I am not.  BUT the drug kept me in such a fatigued state_ I was now a burden on my family. The other side effects like the muscle cramps and urination frequency were issues that I could live with_ but not the fatigue and depression.  I stopped taking LOTREL altogether and I lost 35lbs and my fatigue and depression has ""mysteriously"" vanished.

I have been sent to several other specialists and no one could figure it out. I guess its partly my fault also for trusting a pen happy DR to write more perscription instead of trying to figure out all these symtoms i was getting after perscribing this medicine.although they all didnt come at the same time it has been strecthed out over several years.

Coughing_ muscle aches/weakness_ foot pain with some fluid retention_ EXTREMELY fatigued_ doom like feelings_ and shortness of breath and find it hard to concentrate at work.  I am being worked up for the fatigue and shortness of breath (have asthma under good control) and I bet it is this drug.  I have put a request in to my physician to get off of this drug and haven't heard back from his office yet.  I was put on this medicine off-label for my headaches and they have been better but this drug tends to lower my blood pressure and I already have a low blood pressure.  Symptoms seemed to get worse when it was switched to a generic brand.  Can't wait to get off of it.

30, 3, Hypertension,Increasing fatigue_ profuse sweating_ and concentration problems.,Started on a 10/20 dosage 3 years ago as a replacement for Zestril which my insurance provider would no longer cover (but it worked very well).  Lotrel worked well at first_ then after 2 years my body got used to it and increased to 10/40 dosage.  Noticed obvious increase in sweating_ nocturnal urination_ long and short term memory problems_ dizziness.  Did not notice any ED problems.  Fainted on standing a few months ago_ checked BP (while standing) but it was not abnormally low.  Started checking BP twice a day while still taking 10/40 and it seemed normal (averaging around 120/80).  Left a stressful job a few months ago and thought I'd check BP without taking Lotrel for a few weeks to get a new base reading.  No difference with or without taking Lotrel now.  Time to find something new (if needed_ hopefully not).  It's worth trying to see if it works for you but good idea to monitor its effects at least occasionally and note the common problems people are reporting with it.,M,52,3  years10/40 1X D,12/14/2010,Lotrel

Before getting pregnant_ my BP was always 120/80. After giving birth_ my blood pressure ranged anywhere from 140-180/80-110.

I have no interests but in my bed now. At times i also gets bloating and slight pains in my abdomin when im no where near my monthly. The only reason im giving this medicine a chance is because my mom who has it_ hypertension(although she didnt get it til she was 45)_ was using it and the doctor thought if it works for her maybe it will for me. but she swelled a lot and is now off it and after doing research i found out that it can cause asthenia wich is weakness of muscles and cause tiredness!!! eventhough it brought my hypertension stage 2 (185/117) to 120/90 I am going to ask my doctor for somethn else and this time i wont tell him what my mom is on cause even if it help,It works but it hasnt been properly studied and for a younger age group i think its just all wrong since it can cause asthenia.,F,24,9  months5/10 1X D,11/29/2010,Lotrel

48, 2, high blood pressure,Works great at lowering my blood pressure--side effects not too bothersome at first. Feet and leg pain_ which I attributed to my job as a waitress_ constant coughing_ shortness of breath_ but it gets worse the longer you take it.,Last 6 months_ developed SEVERE lower back/hip pain on left side_ which sometimes spreads across entire lower back...pain so bad_ it sometimes brings me to tears while working. Then about a month ago_ mental depression set in. I'm normally a very happy_ energic_ out-going person. I became withdrawn_ unusually sensitive_ irritable_ lethargic--everything I am not! I missed a couple of doses of this poison 2 weeks ago_ and guess what? I FELT GREAT!!! NO PAIN AT ALL!!! I WAS HAPPY AGAIN!!! I wasn't constantly short of breath_ wasn't coughing_ had energy...just felt like my old self again! Went to Dr. today_ told him how I'd been feeling_ told him how I felt when off the Lotrel. He told me_ no_ he had NEVER heard of Lotrel causing those side-effects-tried to get me to take anti-depressants-I said no! I insisted it had to be the Lotrel. He's sending me for back x-rays (guess he doesn't believe me) and switched me to tenormin 25 at night and norvasc 10 in the morning. Tenormin is a beta blocker (YUK!) and norvasc is one of the poisons in Lotrel! I don't think I'll do any better on these new poisons_ but I have no choice but to try them. I go back in 2 weeks...time will tell. If he can't switch me to something that doesn't cause such debilitating side effects_ I'll just have to find a new Dr.,F,56,3  years10/20 1X D,2/23/2010,Lotrel
49, 1, High Blood Pressure,Weight loss at first (15 lbs)_ lack of appetite_ slight coughing_ thought was my asthma/GERD_ then severe depression_ lack of energy/motivation_ anxiety_ tired all the time_ can't sleep at night from coughing_ extreme coughing causing gagging and throwing up_ sleepy all the time_ can't concentrate_ nasal congestion_ isolated myself_ couldn't do much. Up many times during the night from the coughing. Sometimes insomnia. Started to have leg swelling.,I was happy at first that this drug suppressed my appetite and helped me to lose weight but the benefit of this stopped after a few months with no more additional weight loss and ensuing bad side effects. It DID help with blood pressure_ but not worth the side effects. Didn't know what was wrong with me_ had a bad cold_ then it seemed to get worse plus I have asthma and GERD so thought it was that_ am on Triminterene (sp?) plus the 5-20 generic lotrel_ loved it at first since I lost weight_ helped my BP a lot! Never had it so low_ but after a couple of months_ my life deteriorated and now I was wondering what is wrong with me and how unhappy I am. Not really knowing why. After reading what other people wrote I know that this is the same problem. Stopping it as of today! I want my life back! I was also on Linosipril and it also caused me to cough a lot. I've been out of it since October 2009 to today February 17_ 2010...doctors can't figure out what is wrong and treat my symptoms not mentioning possible side effects of Lotrel.,F,43,7  months5-20 1X D,2/17/2010,Lotrel

51, 5, high blood pressure,I do not remember any side affects worth mentioning,I started taking Lotrel 10/20 (4) years ago after a physical at work revealed HBP and I was told by the nurse to get medicated .. everything was fine until I retired & when I was going to have to pay for it myself_ I decided to just quit taking it .. anyway I had been monitoring consistently_ both at home & at work .. I was in the 120/60 range on the Lotrel .. when I quit it the BP started going up_ sometimes 180/90 or even slightly higher_ which is no big deal to me considering some of the propaganda you read nowadays saying high blood pressure may not be that bad after all .. anyway_ I started getting these_ what I call Ice pick headaches maybe a few time a week & lasting only a second or two_ so decided to go back on Lotrel to see if the headaches subside .. just picked up a prescription today & will update progress in a month or two .. or,M,68,2  years,1/29/2010Email,Lotrel

54, 1, Blood Pressure,Loss of voice_ extreme asthma type systoms_ dizziness_ can not sleep_ hypertension and exteme foot pain.,"My husband has taken Lotel for 2 years.  He has experienced extreme foot pain_ over the past two years has been treated for extreme ""adult"" asthma_ with every inhaler known to man.  In the past 6 months_ we have been to numerous specialists_ cario_ lung_ alergy_ ENT_ have had CT scans_ ekg_ echocardio gram_ blood tests_ hospitalized_ etc.  Last week we finally saw a great doctor who specializes in Critical Care & internal medicine _ who told us that my husband either had the worst lungs on the face of the earth_ or the worst case of asthma he had ever seen_ OR his real gut feeling was - it is the LOTREL.  He took him off the LOTREL_ advised that it would take 2 weeks to feel better and be able to breathe.  It has been 4 days and his voice shoulds so much better_ just waiting and praying that all of the other side affects go away too.  This is terrible medicine!  My husband has really suffered while on this medication_ and it did not really help in lowering his BP.",M,66,2  years,12/7/2009Email,Lotrel
55, 1, High blood pressure,Extreme foot pain while walking_ swelling legs_ depression_ dry swollen nasal passages.,I took this drug for about a year-6 months ago dosage was incresed and that was I started to notice the problems. I went to the orthopaedic doctor and they found nothing wrong with my feet.  I knew I had to find a reason for my discomfort and started researching medication side effects and found this web site.  I call my doctor right away and requested a different blood pressure RX.  Within 2 days edema was gone.  It took about 8 days for my feet to start to feel better.  I want to thank others who posted.  You helped me to figure out what was causing my problems--not the doctors or the drug web disclaimers.  I can not even begin to tell you how much better I feel overall.,F,50,1  years,12/4/2009,Lotrel
56, 1, High blood pressure,Dry nasal passage_ joint pain and pain in my feet so bad I could barely walk at times.  PCP and orthopaedic doctor could not see anything in x-rays. (previously tibula repair with left rode) thought maybe a stress fracture.,I am thankful I found this web site and saw other were experincing foot pain also.  Called dr for a new RX. Hopeful pain/discomfort will get better.  Pain had already affected my life style. Foot pain last 2 months or also.  Joint pain longer-but unsure of a specific time.,F,49,365  days,11/23/2009,Lotrel
57, 1, High Blood Pressure,I have been on Lotrel for appooximately two years. During the first few weeks_ I didn't notice much change. Then I noticed the fatigue and body aches over the next 9 months but did not connect it to the Lotril. On November/08 I was at deer camp and had severe back and under the rib pain. Had my wife drive me to the emergency room. They run cat scans_ MRI_ blood tests and no one could figure out what was causing the problem. After November the pain moved from my back to my hips and legs. My feet and hands begin to swell which made sleeping very uncomfortable. Doctor could not figure it out. Four weeks ago my script was doubled from 5-20 to 10-40. HOLY CRAP..I thought I was dying. I even considered ending my life. I could barely get out of bed_ slept most of the time_ stomach was bloated and had all the symptoms as earlier mentioned. I am quiting the drug today and will let you know the results. Why doesn't the FDA do something about this?,This drug should be investigated by FDA. This drug could kill!!,M,55,2  years,11/5/2009,Lotrel
58, 5, HTN only,first week_ nausea_ dizzy and Lightheaded when standing up to quickly. After week mild general weakness_ week 2_ no general complaints now. ,All my symptoms are normal_ and were expected. I went from a normal non active bp of 160ish/100ish_ up to 180/120ish active.You have to remember going from a high BP like this to 120/70ish is a big change for your body to adapt to. There will be side effects for a short time_ and they should eventually level out_ if you don't feel these side effects_ the drug is probably not working for you. How many years did you have HTN as the norm_ vs how long have you experienced normal BP? 3-4 days vs 20-50 yrs plus?? Plus_ ALL drugs have side effects.,M,31,6  months,11/2/2009,Lotrel
59, 1, Hypertension,After one month taking Lotrel 10/20_ I experienced loss of concentration_ fatigue and slight edema on my lower extremities but my blood pressure went down from 196/96 to 130/74. No headaches anymore. Bld. Pressure went back to normal. After the second month_ I felt the pain in the Lt. knee only_ then down to leg and become more painful on the ankle_ more edema and I could hardly walk especially in the morning. I stopped taking the medication. I would not recommend Lotrel to anybody. My Doctor switched me to another antihypertensive drug. Please listen to your body and speak up to your doctor.,,M,59,3  months,10/25/2009,Lotrel
