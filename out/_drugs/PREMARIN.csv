15, 5, Menopause symptoms 20 years ago.,Only good effects.     But what about the Provera I take 12 days a month?  That one worries me but I seem to need it in order not to build up the endometrial lining.,First took .625 which I cut into pieces so it was about a 3/4 pill I was taking.  Maybe 7 or 8 years later went to the .3 dose.  Have been taking that for the rest of those 20 years worth.  I LOVE IT.  Only side effect is thinning hair_ but maybe that's from the Provera I take 12 days a month.  ??  I've tried a time or two to do without Premarin but life wasn't worth living.

After 5 years my GP put me on 0.625mg of Premarin (side effects of changing were very bad).  After these had settled I got on very well will Premarin_ but had doseage cut to 0.3mg 2 years ago by my GP who wants me to come off soon.  When reducing I just went from one day using 0.625mg to 0.3mg the next I had side effects of hair loss_ mouth ulcers (still get issues with my gums & ulcers)_ hair is thinner than it was but it has stopped shedding so much now.  I am about to have my first mammogram and if all well the GP will let me stay on them.  Interesting to see others have been on them for 20odd years I'm hoping I will be the same.  Am told I look 10 years younger than I am I have a younger husband who is only 44 so Im not keen to stop them as we still have an active sex life.

I also experience frequent headaches lasting 2 to 3 days at a time . my memory became so poor that it has affected my work performance to the point that I can no longer be a productive member of the work team .physically _ my vagina burns _pains and itches almost constantly . my hair is rapidly becoming so thin _ im sure I will be wearing a wig in a few months .never in my life have  I had depression . now _ I not only see nothing wrong with suicide _I now view it as the best possible remedy out of a horrible tortuous situation .,F,67,35  years0.625 mg 1X D,7/23/2015,Premarin
29, 5, Total Hysterectomy at 39,Weight gain. Gained about 30 pounds gradually since surgery.  Levelled off and just bounce up and down 10 or 15 lbs or so at a time.,"Started high dosage 1.25 right after surgery.  Lost insurance a year later and with high prices_ started cutting in half to .625.  Noticed an increase in hot flashes (never completely without the flashes).  Prices kept going up_ so I tried to stop one Summer about 4 years ago.  It was awful_ I really can't even remember that whole Summer.  Hot flashes/night sweats were almost unbearable lasting days and days at a time.  Memory got so much worse_ I truly though I was losing my mind.  Mood swings were very noticeable by others.  Leg pain and just a general tired and down feeling (depression I guess).  Insomnia was somehow the worst symptom_ probably because I have never had any problem with sleeping.  I know ""back in the day"" that menopause was considered a sickness for women and they did not work like we do now.  I am convinced Premarin is helping me with daily life and I would not be doing well without it_ or at the least taking anti-depressants which I know others who take them with lots of side effects.  I could do without the weight gain_ but will not stop taking Premarin.",F,46,7  years.625 1X D,6/26/2015Email,Premarin
30, 5, hysterectomy,Swelling in hands_ ankles_ abdomen_ legs and feet on .9mgNone on .625 feel great.,I started taking .625 afyer my surgery 2 years ago. Dr. Upped to .9 after a few months.  I took for 1 year_ had weight gain_ but fatigue was gone felt good.  My insurance changed and I found Canada Drugs so ordere from them for $60.00 rather than over $100 from pharmacy.   They didnt have .9mg but had .3 so I took 3 of the .3mg per day after 1yr decreased to 2 of the .3mg every other day and found a great balance. No swelling_ lost weight_ felt great. Only problem with mail order is it takes about 10 days to get pills_ so you need to keep up with reorder.  I went 2 weeks without and was uncomfortable_  skin broke out_ yeast infection.  I will continue to take the .625 as it really helps.  I was concerned about going on this drug_ but after reading everyone's experiences_ I made a decision to go on.  It's quality of life and drug trials are done in the interest of drug companies not the public.  The women who were on the trial were all over the age of 60 and could have had heart disease anyway.  If you don't take progesterone there is not a problem_  it's the combo for women with uteruses that have risk for cancer. Thank you to everyone who posted here_ you helped me make my decision to go on and stay on this drug.,F,49,2  years.925,5/8/2015Email,Premarin
