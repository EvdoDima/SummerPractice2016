I gained 30 pounds and got scar tissue from the blood draws.  I was forced to stay on this medication for far too long_ and I cannot think of one positive thing to say about it.I have been off of it for about a year now_ and I feel infinitely better.  The withdrawal is absolutely terrible (severe headache_ -extreme- insomnia_ nausea_ ect.) but it is definitely worth going through to stop taking the medicine!,F,13,6  years300MG 2X D,1/14/2016,Clozaril

9, 3, Psychosis NOS,Drooling_ bedwetting (got dose lowered and it stopped) Extreme drowsiness.,Paliperidone had no effect so they put me on it. Definitely helped with the psychosis but i hate the sleepiness so much. I mean sleeping 10-16 hours of the day. If i force myself up early im foggy and fall asleep by 630pm.

I will end my life soon... death is better than suffering like this for the rest of my life I just hate what this meds have done too me! Even thou I'm now only on 250mg reduced from the high amounts I was taking when I 1st started it. Much love to others whom suffer or feel like the way I do. Keep strong God knows what we are going threw never let others bring you down in life even if its family members...that's happened in my case...,,M,24,2  years250mg,5/26/2014,Clozaril
18, 1, They HATE you!,DEATH. NEVER voluntarily start taking this drug. Seroquel is better one. Lots of side-effects.,,M,34,1  days,3/18/2014,Clozaril
19, 5, Bipolar 1,Drooling (worse in first few years)_ weight gain_ craving for sweets especially after a dose at night_ sedation that lasts way into the next day_ too much time on the couch watching bad TV.,Great drug for treating my terrible depression (suicidal thoughts) and for somewhat stabilising my rapid cycling. Hasn't fixed everything but I wouldn't like to think where I would be without it. At a time when I had run out of options it was a wonder drug for me.,F,40,6  years250mg 1X D,9/19/2013,Clozaril
20, 3, Schizoaffective Disorder - Bipolar,Nighttime drooling_ carb cravings_ sedation,I had to switch to Clozaril after developing Tardive Dyskinesia on another anti-psychotic.  I find my mood to be much better on it_ and I have no hallucinations.  I take the bulk of it at night_ and I am really tired after an hour for about 3 hours_ and then I am fine.  Sometimes I fight going to bed_ and have experienced hallucinations a few times when I did.,F,54,9  months150mg 2X D,8/31/2013Email,Clozaril
21, 1, psychoses,"Doctors are in ' love ' with clozaril at the moment coz it has been known since the 1950's. So ofcourse it is the most ""studied"" antipsychotic.I know someone on clozaril who drools during the day time and docs couldnt care less. But hey_ what can they do about it? You have to be admitted in a psych ward to start on this. If you dont like clozaril youre in shit coz docs rarely take someone off it. Meant to be a miracle drug. Keep in mind EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. Pretty arrogant claiming this will wipe out psychoses.Was a sugar pill for me.",,M,31,9  months400,5/21/2013,Clozaril
22, 4, Bipolar disorder/insomnia,drooling_ extreme tiredness that lasts well into the day,I am always leery about a drug that requires weekly_ then monthly blood tests_ but I will say that it is the only thing that has been able to put me to sleep for more than 2 hours. I have tried at least 30 different meds and none of them worked as well as clozapine. I've been taking it for almost 2 years now.,F,36, 100 MG 1X D,5/3/2013,Clozaril
23, 1, Bipolar 1 - Schizoaffective,Drooling_ sleeping for 24+ hours straight.,My daughter taxes Clorzaril and we were very hopeful but no difference in her life than any other drug she tried.  Zyprexa_ lithium_ lamictal_ haldol_ seroquel etc.  She is busy focusing on the voices in her head and doesn't talk much but this has been the ONLY drug she has asked and demanded to stop taking.  She hates it but can't tell me why.  It does make her sleep alot however and crave sweets.  Doc cut her back to 400 mg and added 80 mg of Latuda and also kept her on seroquel in combination.,F,24,5  months650 1X D,4/28/2013,Clozaril
24, 1, Schizophrenia,I took this drug because i had no choice. I was in a high secure hospital and quickly realised i had  to jump through ihoops if i wanted to get out of there. I had to tell them what they wanted to hear and take the meds. All i wanted was to be my spiritual self. Theres no such thing as mental illness its a state of mind_ albeit one that can be difficult_ i did not want my soul destroyed by digital machines and chemicals and bullshit psychology. I hope we make spiritual progress for the sake of our future generations. They should not have to be tortured for having a spirit. This drug clozaril will destroy a part of you. It will damage your physical self just as much as your spiritual. Its like being connected to a machine. You feel good at first_ silence and peace. But once you come off it_ you realise how they are stopping you from being your true self. I realise i was a zombie for 5 years. These people do not want you to think for yourself. What is more dangerous. Being dead inside. I,Dont take it. Its the exact chemical opposite of ecstasy. After i have been off this drug for a while i start to get my natural thoughts back. But I cant sleep without it,M,30,6  years400 1X D,4/6/2013Email,Clozaril
25, 5, Schizophrenia/Psychosis,Some drooling,Finally_ after testing various other medications such as_ Seroquel_ Zyprexa_ Abilify_ and and Risperdal. All of these medications didn't help me stop hallucinating(audial). Clozaril_ after about a week I was fine and living a normal life again. It's a hassle having to do all the bloodworks_ but for me this has been a miracle drug. So it made the bloodworks worth it. After 1 year it is only required once a month(the blood tests). I am free of hallucinations and more focused then any of the other meds I was taking. I give this medication a 5.,M,29,1  years225 MG 2X D,3/19/2013Email,Clozaril
26, 1, Paranoia,Clozaril was taken off the market in the 1960's as a result of deaths from Agranulocytosis. Now patients are tested for this. Plus have to have an ECG at least every 6 months.,,M,19,10  months300,12/20/2012,Clozaril
27, 1, Schizophrenia,Drooling_ droolingThis is more sedating than seroquel. Clozaril is the most sedating antipsychotic.Clozaril has the more weight gain than zyprexa.,Like the comments before: UR bed when u wake up in the morning will be full of saliva. Yuck! The only way to stop salivating is to tell ur doc to take u off it.I can't get off this stuff keep relapsing and guess what? Doctors put me straight back on it again. My life is a misery and zyprexa actually worked better for me.,M,,2  years600 1X D,11/8/2012,Clozaril
28, 2, Schizophrenia,Drooling_ knocked out straight after taking it, This is meant to be the 'Gold standard' the 'Best' antipsychotic. Did NOT do much for me. PLZ remember everyone responds differently to medication. The thing doctors rarely mention is that Clozaril is one of the hardest drugs to discontinue if you don't like the side effects. It can cause 'rebound psychoses' at its worst. Basically your psychoses can sky rocket off the universe by trying to get off this medication even if your doctor takes you off it slowly. Once on Clozapine you might be on it for the rest of your life coz of what is mentioned above. This can be a miracle drug for some people but for me my paranoia and hallucinations were NOT stopped and were actually worse. I hated the drooling which as far as I know can NOT be stopped by anything. Missing more than 2 doses in a row can make you have a relapse which happened to me. On the up side. This is the only antipsychotic that does NOT cause TD(tardive dyskinesia). If your doing fine on something else don't bother changing hoping for a cure coz at the moment there is NONE. ,M,,11  months500 1X D,11/6/2012,Clozaril
29, 5, Schizophrenia,Extreme sedation_ lethargy in the morning_ excessive salivating_ desire to eat sweets that is impossible to resist_ heart races_ panic attacks,Yes_ there are a lot of terrible side effects. Yes_ the blood draws are an inconvenience.But clozapine has controlled my schizophrenia better than any med I've been on before (been on lots of antipsychotics),F,19,1.5  years200 mg 1X D,4/11/2012,Clozaril
30, 1, Light schizophrenia,My son took it for 6 years and his worse of now-totally a vegatable.dont take this drug_its DANGEROUS!,,M,19,1  days400mg,4/3/2012Email,Clozaril
31, 1, sluggish schizophrenia,,THIS IS DEADLY KILLER DRUG. THIS IS SIMPLY USED TO KILL IN MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS. IT JUST KILLS YOU. PERIOD. Outside (prison) hospitals this drug is almost never used because it is simply a KILLER drug. It is 100% unethical to use this drug. YOU DIE.,M,30,1  days 1X D,10/10/2011,Clozaril
32, 5, Schizoaffective/Schizophrenia,Drooling at night and Drowsiness and increased appetite,Clozaril has made me normal. I have no more symptoms of schizophrenia. I am very happy that I was put on this medication and I plan to stay on it. It is worth the trouble of the weekly blood draws.,F,23,6  weeks200 mg 1X D,3/23/2011Email,Clozaril
33, 1, depression/bipolar II,Extremely sedating--I slept 12-14 hours out of every 24. Increased appetite. I lost my personality and became like a zombie.,I did not realize what clozaril was doing to me until I stopped taking it and the sedation wore off. Then I could see that the two years I spent on clozaril were two years that I spent as a zombie laying on the couch. I wish I had not taken this drug.,F,41,2  years200mg 1X D,6/10/2010,Clozaril
34, 1, self-injury_ bpd,drooling_ EXTREME weight gain (in institution and not eating much too)_ drowsiness_ not remembering events_ bed-wetting_ 100% zoned out_ taken off because my white blood cell count dropped,"this is the most EVIL med I have ever taken.  My doc wanted to put me back on it saying that_ ""my white blood cell count didn't drop too far"" last time I was on it.  Doctors are currently in love with this med_ it works for some_ but event they have quite bad side effects from what I know.",F,25,4  months,1/11/2010,Clozaril
35, 5, Schizophrenia,Drooling_ Sedation_ Seizures,"I have to take a seizure medication with Clozaril because my seizure threshold is low.  Actually_ if I take any antipsychotic I have to take an anticonvulsant_ so it's not just Clozaril_ it's just that I have to take a higher dose on Clozaril.  Ah_ for the drooling_ you can take (sublingually) the eye drops that they give you at the eye doctor to dilate your pupils.  It stops the drooling.  I take a couple drops under each side of my tongue before bed and I don't drool at night...nice.  My doctor taught me that one.  When I went to fill my prescription for the eye drops_ I had to explain it to the pharmacist...lol.  I don't get too much sedation_ I mostly sleep it off_ as I take the med at night.  I've tried all the meds and this is the best one.  It even helps the negative symptoms_ which are mostly what remained for me with the other meds.  I had a lot of problem with ""connecting"" to people_ which affected my ability to form relationships with people and my interactions with people.  Clozaril helps a lot with that so I can relate to other people and ""connect.""  It is hard to explain_ but it definitely helps me feel human.  For me this has been a great medication.",F,37,6  years,11/8/2009,Clozaril
36, 1, bipolar,gross medicine,doctors say this medicine is the best_ thats a big lie and rumor.  This antipsychotic did nothing for me.  Most patients grow out of there bipolar or schizophrenia by the time they turn 30 years old anyway.,M,29,2  years,10/9/2009,Clozaril

The mandatory bloodwork is a major inconveinence and pain in the rump.The 2 good things about it are:no sexual side effects_and good for anxiety.,M,,12  years,12/13/2008,Clozaril
