0, 2, Migraines,Very rapid and continual weight gain.,I have taken Topamax for several years.  The drug seemed to quit working_ and my doctor was not comfortable increasing the dosage.  He decided to add verapamil.  Topamax is known for weight loss.  Needless to say I was very surprised at how quickly I gained weight (20 pounds in a year) while taking verapamil in addition to a medication that causes weight loss!  I am quite certain it is related to the medication since I am a very health conscious individual.  Aside from the weight gain_ verapamil has been mostly effective at relieving my migraines_ with only a few breakthrough headaches.,F,28,1  years,6/28/2008,Verelan pm

2, 1, migraine preventative,SEVERE constipation_ bloated abdomen_ weight gain_ night sweats,a 300 mg dosage and did not seem to contribute to helping my migraines lessen. The constipation was unbearable. I took colace and dulcolax every night. I went off the Verelan a couple of weeks ago and have already lost ten pounds and my stomach is almost flat again. I dont know for sure if the night sweats are related to verelan_ but I havent had them since I quit this drug.,F,39,8  months,10/17/2005,Verelan pm
