0, 3, trigeminal neuralgia,Mostly effective in controlling severe and disabling TN_ especially when switching to XR.  But  over time_ the side effect for confused thinking and balance took hold.  It had a severe and insidious impact on my life.,"Looking back_ I wish my MD had been more attentive to the side effects and considered alternatives to Tegretol.  When I presented in 2012 with severe TN (levels 7-10 pain_ couldn't talk_ no solid food)_ I got immediate relief.My current MD says that my 1200 MG dosage is like constantly having two beers and knocks 5 pts off your IQ.  It has a subtle influence on your judgment.While this was all happening I met a fantastic woman and became engaged.  To merge our families with three kids meant I had to be sensitive to her needs_ sell my house and buy a new house for us_ while also holding a demanding job and going to school part time.  I was very good with the fun tasks.  But if it was complex_ things got foggy.  Contact a realtor_ get a loan_ fix my credit_ create a list of things to fix in order to sell the house_ create a list to invite to the wedding.  I would step back and look at myself_ ""You're not doing this.  How odd.""  I see now Tegretol made me into slug.  And my fiance? saw this_ didn't see the connection to Tegretol_ and began to wonder about me.My MD knew the basics of our situation_ had met my fiance?.  If he had been more compassionate he might have seen what was happening and counseled me on what to expect.Ultimately my finance saw what I was doing_ became angry and defensive_ interpreted my actions as meaning that I really didn't want her and the marriage_ and cancelled the wedding five weeks out.  I was angry and confused_",M,55,4  years800-1200MG 3X D,8/3/2016Email,Tegretol-xr

2, 3, Epilepsy,Early morning joint stiffness is a definite side effect..it does wear off after 30 minutes or so.Walking down the stairs in the morning after getting up is very slow and precarious.  I changed to Lamictal because of increase in appetite and resultant weight gain on Tegretol.Whilst on Lamictal I had no stiffness whatsoever-it was a surprise..totally unexpected bonus.Unfortunately it kept me awake and after a year on it I had v.bad seizures and went back on to Tegretol Retard.The stiffness returned and I noticed an immediate slowness in my thinking.I am 67 and and it is now 17 years since I went back on to it ..total no.of years taking Tegretol is 37 less 1 year when I changed to Lamictal.I have injury-induced aches and pains in addition to the Tegretol side effects.One morning I felt less stiff and realised I had forgotten to take a tablet the night before.As an anticonvulsant it works so I am afraid to try anything else.Another bad side effect is increase in cholesterol..mine was 10 plus!!Am now on statins..at least for now.,,F,67,10  years600 mg,10/15/2014,Tegretol-xr
3, 1, Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy,Dizziness_ ringing in ears and extreme vomiting.,This could only happen to me! My sleep neurologist  started me on  800 mg of Tegretol for  NFLE and she forgot to titrate the dose. After taking it for one night and the next morning_ I ended up in the ER due to extreme dizziness_ vomiting and   a ringing in my ears.   I switched Doctors and changed  to lamictal  (titrated) which is working well.,F,40,2  days 2X D,9/22/2014,Tegretol-xr
4, 1, Seizures,Just about every side effect listed on your page_ incompetence_ mood disorders_ instability_ feeling like a drunk_ could not remember what I had done that morning_ started to contemplate suicide as I was not able to cope in my job and perform as a provider for my family.,Now on Epilim and I am back to the old me. Please if you are anything like I was go and persuade your neurologist to try something else.,M,55,400  days500 2X D,7/30/2014,Tegretol-xr
5, 1, Mood Disorder,When I was a teen my anxiety was misdiagnosed as Bipolar Disorder and the doctor gave me tegretol_ not sure what the dosage. I went from weighing 115 to weighing 163. I stopped being able to remember everyday words as simple as license plate or macaroni. Sometimes I couldn't remember my own name_ age or phone number. Thinking became so hard for me that I had to drop out of school. My mood did not get any better_ the doctor just thought it did because I was no longer able to express any emotion. My hair stopped growing_ my nails got thin and they were always breaking_ my skin broke out in the most horrific acne I've ever seen. I slept about 16 hours every night and still never felt rested. After about 3 years I had enough of living in that zombified state and stopped cold turkey_ the withdrawals were horrible_ shaking and irritability like you would not believe but it was worth it to get that devil drug out of my system. It took at least a year for my memory to come back and for me to f,Hated it,F,20,3  years 2X D,2/3/2014,Tegretol-xr
6, 4, Trigeminal neuralgia,Weight gain_ memory loss (technical words_ names)_ depression,While Tegretol has been right for my pain_ I would like to pursue a different treatment to avoid the side effects.

I can tell it's burning through the other meds I am taking_ so some adjustment is still needed.,It has been a miracle drug for my head pain.  I still have daily pain_ but not as bad.

10, 3, seizures,drowsiness/tiredness_ slight confusion_ some memory recall problems esp short term (though can remember later usually).,mostly its the drowsiness... i take 150mg in the morning and 200mg at night_ and it can be tough waking up sometimes_ like in a fog. I was on 200mg during the day but went back down to 150mg as i couldnt function properly. Thinking of going back to 150mg at night (as my original dose) however am concerned about it not having quite enough effect and i can get some very slight seizurelike activity (without unconciousness or anything_ just like a cut off semi seiz..) wierd.But this tiredness_ lethargy_ bad recovery_ im not sure if its just the teg or some remnants of a more serious issue i had with tiredness even before taking it... like chronic fatigue/system worn out...All in all though the tegretol has stopped my seizures (one every 6weeks or so) for 8months now which is great.,M,34,8  months150 2X D,6/1/2011Email,Tegretol-xr
11, 2, Complex Partial Seizures/Mood,Inital side effects lasted for about 8 days. Although were strangley enjoyable_ felt quite drunk! Giggly_ silly_ goofy. A metalic tast in throat some times_ a bit tired_ a bit unsteady. Not the best - but manageable. After the first 8 days_ the inital side effects dropped off and I began to feel very drugged and scared. My mood became very unstable. I am now weening off it.,FYI: I am very sensative to medications in general!! The inital side effects were fine_ although once it settled in - I wasn't fine at all! But that is just me. I have heard a lot of people have done well on it.,F,29,11  days200 1X D,1/28/2011,Tegretol-xr
12, 1, seizures,Side effects were very minimal. Mouth dryness. Mood was exceptional. Very happy all the time. Also slept really well and didn't even wake up tired. I had been on Keppra for 2 1/2 years and never slept and was tired all the time. I thought this was going well. Then I developed flu-like symptoms after about two weeks at full dose. I started out at 100mg. I had horrible head pain_ neck pain_ chills and body aches like I had been thrown down the stairs. I had a blood test and told to stop the tegretol immediately.,After I stopped the medication_ I thought the symptoms would stop_ but they did not. They got worse. I had toxic liver something. This has been going for a week and the doctors say it might be another week. I never would have taken this medication if I had known this might happen.,F,45,1  months200mg 2X D,12/3/2010Email,Tegretol-xr
13, 5, Seizures,Get tired easily.,When I started getting seizures I was put on Dilantin which was not working for me because I was getting major mood swings. When I was 11 I was put on tegretol XR and that's when I started to get less and less seizures. Now_ I have been 7 years without a seizure and I am very happy with what tegretol has done for me!,F,20,9  years300mg 2X D,11/4/2010,Tegretol-xr

15, 4, Bi-Polar II,Fatigue_ goes away somewhat_ hair loss_ skin thinning and spots_ easy to burn_ dry mouth_ insomnia_ short term memory problems_ word recall problems sometimes_ increased appetite,For me living without a medication like tegretol is just not possible. As such medications go I have had the fewest side effects on tegretol. I know the hair_ skin and probably memory problems have a lot to do with vitamins and I do take a multivitamin but it is not enough. I do not gain weight because of the tegretol but I have to watch my diet because I do feel hungry a lot of the time. Still well worth living with these side effects than the dark hole of depression I most often find myself in with no medication.,F,32,8  years600mg 1X D,7/16/2010,Tegretol-xr
16, 4, seizures,General fatigue_ ability to fall asleep anywhere_ anytime.  Loss of sex drive.  Weight gain.  Serious brain fog.,It controls my complex partial seizures_ which is good.  I haven't had a seizure in more than three years_ and I'm now starting to taper the dose downwards VERY slowly (going down by about 100 mg/day this year_ maybe another 100 mg/day next year.)  On the not-so-good side_ Tegretol completely erased my sex drive.  It also kind of blunts my emotional responses to events_ so that I retain a kind of detachment (which makes sense when you remember that it's also prescribed as a mood stabiliser).  I would go off it if I could.,F,51,4  years250 mg 2X D,7/8/2010,Tegretol-xr
17, 4, Partial Epliepsy,Weight Gain,Has ended the grand mal seizures and has stabilized the seizures to a decent but not total control point.

21, 3, tonic clonic seizures,I have been on this medication for 15 years (since I was 8) and have had no severe issues. Sometimes I would feel dizzy or disoriented_ nausea_ or fatigue. That's about it.,I still get seizures on the medication_ especially if I miss a dose_ but not always. I am thinking of switching to Keppra bc Tegretol can produce osteoperosis in women_ and newer epileptic drugs tend to have less severe side effects. And getting pregnant on tegretol is not recommended either. Just a heads up.,F,23,15  years,3/4/2009,Tegretol-xr

25, 4, bi-polar disorder II hypomania,11/02/07 - some daytime sleepiness but none overall,11/02/07 - I have taken a lot of different mood stabilizer meds and this is the best one so far.  It is very hard for me to wake up in the morning but that has been a lifelong struggle.  Also_ I feel like I crave sweets and have some stomach issues (indigestion_ IBS symtoms_ etc.) but that may not be a result of the Tegretol.  I am also taking 50mg of setraline (Zoloft) and was on Rozerem.  I started with the non XR version of carbamazapine and it made me feel drunk and very dizzy in the morning.,F,35,7  months,11/2/2007,Tegretol-xr

27, 4, Trigeminal Neuralgia,Blurred vision every now and then_ feeling a little agitated every blue moon and lingering headache most days.,Tegretol has been a miracle drug for me. After 15 months of severe facial pain and being misdiagnosed with tmj and dental problems_ inner ear infections_ bad vision_ neck problems_ you name it they claimed I had it. They were giving me every drug known to man until I finally was diagnosed by an emergency room doctor (on a long painful night) when I could not take the pain anymore and thought I would end up dying. After some face and jaw x-rays he said I had trigeminal neuralgia NOT tmj_ he put me on Ultram which took about 50% of the pain away and told me to go see a neuralogist. The neuralogist put me on tegretol and about 90% of my pain is gone as long as I stay on track. All day long I seem to have a lingering mild headache but I will take that pain anyday of the week verses the pain I have had to live with before. Every once in a while the pain comes back and the Tegretol XR does not seem to be working but it is few and far between_ most days it is wonderful.

29, 5, petit-mal seizures causing migraine,I am more tired when I take this medicine.,It is very unusual for a person who has my kind of seizures to be on this medicine_ but it is the only one that helps me. If I don't take it_ I will have a migraine the very same day. I take 2 200 mg tablets twice a day- that's 800 mg/day for those of you who might be confused. I was on Depakote before this_ but I grew out of it.,F,23,12  years,9/5/2007,Tegretol-xr

31, 4, epilepsy,Short term memory problems_ have to concentrate to remember something detailed like an address for example,I take 200mg twice daily. Epilepsy caused me to have to re-train from a Chemical Engineer to Information Technology. Don't know if related to tegretol_ but I have to frequently urinate_ and feel fatigued. However_ when I exercise it helps. I play squash three times a week to a good standard and have a no problems with the stress of my job. The quality of my life exceeds incomparably that without tegretol. I have driven for 14 years.,M,44,16  years,1/3/2007Email,Tegretol-xr
32, 4, Bi-Polar_ nerve pain,DIZZINESS and intoxicated feeling. The off and on dizziness is most bothersome. Also_ if I forget to take it at it's usual time_ I start to feel very sick.,It really make me feel drunk at first_ but the effects slowly wore off and I feel great on it now.

34, 3, Seizures_ Bi-Polar,Sour Stomach_Restlessness_lack of clarity in thought,The drug took forever to find the proper dosage. I now take 1000 mg's a day but I occasionally have interaction problems with the vicodin I take for my knees and back and the clonazepam for sleep. The back of my head would start feeling overpressurized and my eyes would turn yellow_ a sign of over dose from one or all drugs_ but I never take moire tha usual. A day of of them will usually do the trick.,M,31,4  months,11/28/2005,Tegretol-xr
35, 2, mania,standing balance problems_ wrists became so stiff and painful I could not do pushups any more.,blood tests are bothersome_ getting off can cause siezures_ after I got off my wrist pain went away.  Do not overtake this medication_ I know two people who did and their judgement of distances made it impossible to walk until the tegretol cleared.  Drugs that slow liver cytochromes_ like some antibiotics_ can cause an overdose without any change to you normal dosage.,M,46,2  years,9/12/2005,Tegretol-xr
36, 5, nocturnal seizure disorder,Actually_ none.,It's awesome.  I am able to only use 250 mg a day (two big_ one little)_ which is_ I think_ possibly beneath the lowest typical dosage.  The timed-release is just grand.  BTW_ I was prescribed this because I am a woman of childbearing age and my two top-notch female neurologists told me that this was the best for childbearing.  I had a child with it and had no problems either.  Good job.,F,44,19  years,7/29/2005,Tegretol-xr
37, 5, nocturnal seizure disorder,none,oops. sorry. I posted earlier and said I was taking 250 mg a day. I'm not. I'm taking 500 mg a day.  200 mg in the mornings and 300 at night.  I was taking 600 but pushed my doc to lower it since I prefer to take less in the daytime.  I heartily disliked dilantin. Ick.,F,44,19  years,7/29/2005,Tegretol-xr

42, 5, trigeminal neuralgia,slight drowsiness,Tegretol has been a miracle drug for me.  After 8 years of being misdiagnosed with atypical facial pain_ tmj_ dental problems_ even cervical facet joint syndrome_ a family practitioner diagnosed trigeminal neuralgia and put me on tegretol.  For 8 years I took Oxycontin_ Vicoden_ Darvocet_ all kinds of muscle relaxers and antidepressants_ etc. and nothing helped.  I tried acupuncture_ hypnosis_ chiropractic_ homeopathic medicine_ biofeedback_ and had counseling with a pain psychologist. Several days a week I experienced nausea and vomiting from the excruciating pain.  I prayed for God to let me die.  After the third day of taking Tegretol XR_ the pain was reduced to an annoying cramp_ and since then I have experienced almost complete relief.
