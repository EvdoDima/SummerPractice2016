1, 2, pilonidal cyst in lower back,Lightheadedness_ vomiting_ forgetfulness_ anxiety_ sun sensitivity,I was taking this medicine for 2 days when I decided to stop.

It was to the point I could not even carry on with day to day activities.  I know I only had an allergic reaction_ but I will never take this again.,F,23,2  days,2/18/2007,Bactrim pediatric
