1, 3, Endometriosis,A little break through bleeding the first 2-3 months.  Some anxiety at random times_ bad acne (on chest_ back and neck too).  Rollercoaster emotions.  Depression.  Joint/Body aching.,I take this continuously to try and combat my endometriosis.  However_ when the side effects get to be too much_ I have to take a break.  I does work great and do its job to keep me from bleeding_ but I do worry about long term effects_ and how I will keep up dealing with side effects.  I'm very annoyed with the acne_ especially as a 28 year old!,F,28,14  months,3/30/2009Email,Ovral-28
2, 3, pregnancy prevention,Acne face/body_ anorexia_ changes texture of skin_ made skin oily and bumpy.,This gave me my energy back_ but it made me look like a hormonal teenager. Too bad because I loved otherwise. The packaging is bulky and ugly though_ it is in shape of a race track.,F,28,3  months,11/17/2007,Ovral-28
3, 4, Birth Contro and PCOS,Overly emotional at times_ increased anxiety (felt in the chest and neck),I'm actually taking LoOvral but they don't have it listed. I was on Ortho-Tri Lo but that totally dimolished my sex drive! LoOvral has really helped restore it but the downside is more anxiety.,F,26,2  months,10/30/2007,Ovral-28
