Leg cramps severe.,I was prescribe skelaxin along with lyrica and celebrex for fibromyalgia_ osteo arthritis and neck pain from a cervical fusion. I cant sleep_ feel sick all day and nauseas. It does very little for my pain. I suppose it would be slightly more tolerable during the day. I really would not recommend this drug.,F,51,6  months800 mg,6/11/2016,Skelaxin

5, 5, lower back spasm,extreme drowsiness_ pressure in my ears_ sensitivity to noise.,The benefits of this drug far outweigh the side effects. I couldn't move before I started taking this medicine. Within an hour_ I felt relief.,F,55,3  days800mg 3X D,5/14/2015,Skelaxin
6, 5, lower lumbar pain,I am taking this in combination with Daypro and Vicoden. I noticed lightheadedness but again this could be from the combination of meds.This drug has been highly successful thus far. I could not walk without being in excruciating pain and the muscles around my spine and hips would seize and I could not fully move my gait. Within hours I could walk with only minor discomfort and would not get stabbing pain every time I got from a sitting to standing position.,,F,32,1  days800,5/6/2015,Skelaxin
7, 4, Muscle spasms/pain in upper back,Initially maybe a tiny bit of fogginess_ but not sure attributed to the drug,I have had an ongoing issue with muscle pain_ knots and stiffness in my upper back between the shoulder blades. This was aggravated recently and went into one of the worst spasms I've ever had. Pain radiated down my arms and side. Doctor prescribed skelaxin. I found this site and read up on this drug prior to taking it. I was hesitant due to the number of negative experiences. I had also taken a muscle relaxant years ago (think it was flexeral) with no relief. I was also given nabumutone and started taking that first (as I've taken this before for tendinitis). After 2 days I was no better_ so took the skelaxin. I had relief within the hour. I was sure to take it with a full glass of water to avoid the chalking taste or burning others have commented on. I'm on day 2_ and I'm not completely pain free_ but I'm probably 75% better . So far_ no notable side effects.,F,60,2  days800mg 2X D,4/5/2015,Skelaxin
8, 3, Herniated disc_ pinched nerve,Some woosiness_ can definitely tell when 5-6 hour mark since taking pill is approaching. Harder stools.,Does help with burning/muscle pain along shoulder/neck. Doesn't do anything for nerve twitches_ tingles. I am able to work about 8 hours/day. No drowsiness.,F,54,3  weeks800 mg 3X D,3/30/2015,Skelaxin

10, 4, pinched nerves from muscle spasms,Heartburn_ tightness in chest_ chalky taste and smell that doesn't go away for about 12 hours...which would be next does_ bloated,Skelaxin works very well and almost immediately for painful spasms. Better than most muscle relaxers I've used. And it doesn't make me as tired as others_ like soma or flexeril. But I hate the side effects_ so I will only take it if I can't move. Like this morning. I woke up at 4am and couldn't move my neck. Sharp searing pain. You'll take anything to get out of that pain. So I took one 800mg and by 5am I have full ROM_ no pain. Still 6hrs later_ pain minimal. But I am drinking fluids constantly to alliviate burning and H2O tastes like chalk. Not fun. So I recommend getting a sample first from doctor_ bc it seems so many people have very different side effects_ some have none. It's a drug to use cautiously in my opinion_ but it does the job.,F,36,4  weeks3x day 800,1/8/2015,Skelaxin

This drug made zero impact_ though I was very hopeful / thankful my PCP decided to try it ...  did nothing but fill me up with intolerable ""side effects"" (how about the medication doing what it's promised to do ?).

But as soon as it started working it made daily life bearable and I am able to sleep at night.I still feel stiff but no pain to speak of.If you are looking for immediate relief_ stick with the narcotics.I noticed a lot of folks only took it for a day or two.

Worked like a charm..almost from the start it seemed to ""block"" the spasms which were 10/10 painful....allowing me to recover and heal faster.",M,50,7  days800 3X D,10/2/2013,Skelaxin
23, 2, Back pain,30 minutes after taking this pill my tongue felt like I had burned it on hot food_ which I didn't. I tried eating an apple with peanut butter and I had to stop because my tongue was so sore. 4 hours after taking the pill (bedtime now) I had bad cramping in both legs. The feeling was like the bad cramping you get after your legs had fallen asleep and the blood was finally rushing back to them. Also_ had about 8 palpitations or heart fluttery feeling.,I may try taking it again once more since it did help my back pain. Hoping all those sensations were just a coincidence and not side effects.

I have not come in contact with latex while taking skelaxin as far as I know_ when I do come in contact with latex on my face my whole face swells not just my mouth. After taking skelaxin my lips are swollen to the point the skin is peeling. Blisters forming in mouth_ the blisters form quickly and burst shortly after.  Within an hr of taking a skelaxin pill developed severe genital itching that lasts a few hrs and then goes away. I did the in home yeast infection test kit thinking maybe it was a coincident_ but that came back negative. Just feel I have to say it_ I was at my obgyn a week before taking this med and got a clean bill of health and have not engaged in any sexual activity since then so I am confident the intense itching correlates to skelaxin and not a separate issue.Not noticing a diffrence in the pain or spasm when taking it_ the adverse reactions outweigh any benefit I could be getting from this med.,F,28,1  weeks 3X D,7/29/2013Email,Skelaxin

It feels good to feel good again...I wish I had tried it a long time ago_  but didn't because of the price...none of the flexeril_  Valium_ percocet or twenty other drugs worked or either made me pass out.,,F,48,3  days800 mg,9/27/2012,Skelaxin
30, 1, leg muscle cramps & spasms,"insomnia_ feeling of ""swollen muscles""_ sore & tingling leg muscles","My doctor prescribed Skelaxin for muscle cramps that were continuing after a bout that landed me in the emergency room.  While in the hospital they treated me with Flexeril_ which worked very well.  I'm not sure why Skelaxin was prescribed instead of Flexeril afterward_ but the nurse said they were equivalent.  The Skelaxin prescription was filled by Sam's Club with a generic (don't know the manufacturer_ but it's a pink oval scored tablet).  I had asked for a muscle relaxer because I was having difficulty sleeping_ due to the muscle cramps/spasms and twitching in my thighs_ calves_ and toes.  I could cope in the daytime_ but not at night_ so decided to take it only at night.  I took 1/2 of a 800mg tablet Friday night about 11pm. At 3am I was still wide awake_ and took the other half.  I never slept that night_ and did not notice any difference in the cramps/spasms.  Basically_ a sugar pill would have had the same effect_ except for the insomnia.  Saturday night I took one entire tablet before bed.  I never slept that night_ though I felt extremely tired.  After several hours_ I noticed my leg muscles felt ""swollen""_ sore_ and slightly tingly.  I was more sore after generic Skelaxin than before.  Before_ I had ""troubled"" sleep; with the pills_ I had no sleep at all.  Another reason not to take this med - on my drug plan_ 30 generic Skelaxin cost $106_ and 30 generic Flexeril cost $4.

48, 5, lower back pain,No side effects,I pulled my lower back back in april and I reaggravated it about 3 weeks ago. The pain moved from my lower back and spread up towards my right arm from ribcage to shoulder blade. The spasms I had would send searing pain through my shoulder and into my abdomen. I couldn't breathe in deep and moving hurt. Went to the dr thinking all sorts of things wrong and he prescribed metaxalone(skelaxin). First day I took one and I didn't really see a diff. Next day I took all 3 doses and felt awesome. The last two days I've only had to take one pill and its done the job. No pain. However I talked to the pharmacist and he said that if you take pill without food_ its actually a lower dosage_ apparently taking tthis pill WITH food u get all 800mg...so maybe that's why I havennt experienced any side effects at all.

If skelaxin doesn't work for you fine!  Find one that does.  But don't scream and throw fits to take skelaxin off the market that actually works for others.  Live and let live.
