0, 5, Bph,Completely satisfied with reduction of enlarged prostate and symptons. Only side effect is volume of semen decrease. However by staying on an active exercise program it seems to keep me able to have erection and enjoy sex. It does decrease the ejaculate slightly. Benefits out weigh the minimal side effects.,Took every day for one year. It took almost 10 months to show improvement. Last 4 months have cut back to every other day with good results so far,M,56,1  years.5 mg .,3/9/2016,Avodart

4, 3, BPH,Around six weeks after starting Avodart the volune of ejaculate began to decrease until after six months there was nothing at. In addition there was a dramatic change in the sensation I felt at the time if ejaculating; the pleasure was gone. My BPH symptoms had improved and so I decide to stop taking the Avodart in the hope that normal play would resume_ however I'm sad to report the side effects have continued nine years on. My sex life has been ruined!,,M,60,1  days0.5,3/22/2015Email,Avodart
5, 2, Enlarged prostate,None that I'm aware of.,After a year-and-a-half on this medication_ I found it did nothing to shrink the prostate - it's the same size now as it was when I first started to take the drug - and nothing to alleviate the symptoms - frequent urination at night. Doctor contends it prevented the prostate from getting any larger. I contend it did nothing and was a complete waste of time and money. Glass half full/half empty. Will be trying alfuzosin next (Uroxatral generic equivalent).,M,64,16  months0.5 MG 1X D,5/9/2014,Avodart

9, 3, enlarged/inflamed prostate,Leg muscle aches/cramps_ joint stiffness_ tenderness in feet,This is the second time in 2 years that I have taken this drug....with a 6 month break in between.  Symptoms began 20 - 30 days after starting the drug. The drug helps w/shrinking the prostate_ but the side effects are miserable.,M,60,2  months20mg 1X D,2/12/2013Email,Avodart
10, 4, frequent urination/enlarged prostat,,Now taking Avodart every other day_ alternating with Saw Palmetto extract.I believe my prostate has shrunk somewhat more. I will discontinue both Avodart and Flomax (which I also only take every other day now) when I run out. It will be interesting to see if my BPH issues continue to be better (having to urinate less often) and if the sexual side effects completely subside (a little more difficult to get an erection and decreased ejaculate).,M,59,3  years.5 1X O,1/7/2012EmailHistory,Avodart

12, 2, prostate cancer,Tumour quickly became smaller to three quarter size and hardened and became well-defined_ libido decreased to near zero_ sexual frequency reduced to once a month at best_ feelings of severe depression_ despair_ mental degradation_ lethargy_ increased anxiety_ can't wait to get off the stuff.  Feelings of despair and mental degradation increase with continued usage especially after 25 days.,Too many negative side effects for me and hate the stuff.  Wish the tumour would just vanish on its own and they would develop a pill without the side effects or a pill to destroy the tumour.,M,70,42  days0.5 mg 1X D,6/20/2011Email,Avodart
13, 3, Hair Loss,I have taken avodart for two months for hair loss.  It causes something strange to happen when i take the pill at night before be.  i have to go pee like 20 times.  Its weird because i know people take it to stop frequent urination. Maybe because i didnt have that to start with its doing opposite??? i dunno_  gonna keep trying hoping this feeling will go away.  cause i really dont want to loose my hair.  or better yet I really want to keep what i have,,M,25,2  months_5 1X D,10/18/2010,Avodart

16, 4, back pain when urinating,,Iâve been taking for 5 years and will probably continue for rest of life. I began because of some severe pain in my lower side back when urinating. Had to be catheterized several times in emergency room. At first thought was kidney stones. But never found stones_ and doctors could only suggest had something to do with prostate. Meanwhile I also began to show the usual prostate symptoms: urgency_ frequency_ reduced flow. For those I started to take Flomax. The severe pains stopped after several months_ but the other symptoms remained troublesome until recently. The good news is that I've just stopped taking the Flomax after five years and I'm doing fine. I attribute my improvement to the Avodart_ which_ I surmise_ reduced the size of my prostate sufficiently to make taking the Flomax unnecessary to control the symptoms. So there is hope ... though patience is required: 5 years in my case. I guess Avodart was the real agent of long-term change for the better.,M,59,5  years,8/11/2009,Avodart
17, 2, moderate BHP,painful sensitivity to breast nipples_ breast enlargement_discontinued use upon M.D. advice (after 6 months use.),I also take 10 mg of Terazosin_ for urine flow_ am still on this drug.Avodart seems to alleviate the prostate pain I am suffering from_ but the side effects are too strong.,M,66,6  months,10/28/2008,Avodart
18, 4, BPH,Does cause ED if taken 6 hours before sex.  Planning ahead means postponing dose,Flomax had changed my life for the worse.

21, 2, Enlarged Prostate,Anxiety_ rash and pain in groin area_ lowering of libido_  and slowly decreasing overall wellness,Shortly after starting Avodart_ I felt a terrible anxiety in my leg area and lower body.  Had never experienced anything like this in my entire life.  I wrongly blamed it on eye drops taken for Glucoma. The anxiety slowley went away after starting a rigorus vitiamin regiment but was soon replaced with an agressive rash and pain in the groin area.  My Dr. treated the rash with antibiotics and then later with a prescribed cream.  After both treatments the rash returned with a vengence. The light came on and I realized my problems were atributed to the Avodart.  After only 2 days off the pills_ rash is almost gone_ my libito is back_ and I feel like my old energetic self.  I honestly had no idea how far I had drifted from my previous spark for life.  Will visit with my MD in a few days and discuss options.  Perhaps since the recovery is so rapid_ a pill every other day might work_ or even an occassional sabatical from the drug now and then.  Or maybe no Avadart at all ?  I must admit_ it,M,64,18  months,2/11/2008,Avodart
