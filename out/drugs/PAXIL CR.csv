0, 5, anxiety caused by menopause,Some weight gain_ tiredness in the beginning,Complete life saver.  Take it at night and it works best.  I stayed at lowest dose and let my body get used to it.  It did not take the full 6 weeks to work for me--saw great results sooner.  I have zero anxiety now.,F,55,1.5  years12.5 1X D,5/1/2016,Paxil cr
1, 5, OCD,On and off this drug for 8 years_ in that I went off of it once for a few months.  I'd been on for a good few years before going off and had zero withdrawal or problems going off it by tapering down.  For now_ I need Paxil and Seroquel to have a decent quality of life_ as off the drug_ my anxiety rules my mind with obsessive horrible thoughts that plague me.  The only side effects I have are slightly delayed orgasm and mild constipation.,Paxil CR is well tolerated by me and as you can see_ I've been on it uninterrupted for about 6 years.  When I went off of it briefly_ my OCD came back hard...so back on it.,M,40,8  years32.5mg 1X D,4/9/2016,Paxil cr

5, 5, over 10 years on and off,Only medication that works for my anxiety. With all the medications on the market this is the best one. I have tried pretty much every SSRI_SNRI_ Lamictal etc. Paxil works the best and I always go back too it. I can completely go off it cold turkey without any withdrawal symptoms. As far as side effects go the only drawback for me is fatigue.It is a powerful drug and at my current dose it does make me tired so I take it at night. Also if your not careful with your diet it will lead to weight gain.,,M,39,10  years37.5 2x da,9/17/2014,Paxil cr
6, 5, panic disorder,"Okay_ I didn't take much_ and I had a bad allergic reaction to it (BAD_ as in_ couldn't breathe_ hives around throat) ...but I swear this stuff is like COCAINE or something. I've got Graves and really shouldn't be on anti-depressants (am not a depressed person_ etc)_ but doc wanted me to try it at 20mg/day. I took 5mg knowing it might hurt me (though I didn't know about the allergy; one zoloft just made my hr go up to 200bpm and ER). I never knew ""happiness"" before that one dose_ SO MUCH that even with the hives_ I took another few days of 5mg_ then 2.5mg_ then 2.5mg (then pharmacist had us flush them). #ADDICTIVE","There were ""bad"" side effects even on low dose_ and I took it 4 days only_ but this kept me happy like ""high"" for a full week even after I stopped. I can't take zoloft or most SSRIs_ and Paxil was a last-ditch on my doctor's part. I was allergic. AND STILL WANTED TO TAKE THEM. That should tell you something.Of course_ I'm not ""depressed""; I slept well the first night (couldn't breathe well_ needed lots of benedryls the next few nights)_ but felt like I COULD FLY I was so happy inside. This is definitely ""the one that got away"". I think they'll give us Paxil in Heaven and we won't have allergic reactions! Â—Daddy was/is on it for decades for depression; he is so calm/cool/relaxed all the time that people COMMENT_ so I was more than happy to try this! I can't believe I had such a bad allergic reaction to it :( But yes_ if you can take it_ DO SO. I was scared by the tales of getting off Paxil_ but if you take it_ I don't much think you'll care about getting off it one day_ lol.",F,35,4  days5 1X D,4/19/2014Email,Paxil cr
7, 5, PTSD_ADD_ANXIETY_DEPRESSION_,Constipation. Increased appetite_ weight gain.,I noticed within one month of taking Paxil CR_ the ability to stop my mind from racing occurred and I was able to fall asleep. Prior to Paxil CR_ I couldn't stop my brain from racing and it caused sleepless nights as a result. I have feelings of euphoria_ and I am  less emotional.  That's a good thing because feeling depressed and sad all the time can make one ill and cause hospitalization. Needless to say_ I would recommend this medication. I took Zoloft for year's_ but it made me aggressive and caused uncontrollable muscle movement. Paxil CR by far is a much better antidepressant.,F,57,3  months25 MG 1X D,4/10/2014Email,Paxil cr

10, 4, Depression/Anxiety/OCD,Fatigue_ emotional blunting_ low libido.,"Paxil is the only SSRI that calms my racing thoughts.  The effect on anxiety is almost immediate for me.  It also helps with depression_ but I suspect some of that is just from feeling calm.  I've tried about 15-20 psychiatric medications_ searching for the elusive ""cure""_ but Paxil_ Lamictal and exercise seem to be as good as it gets.  It gets a 5 for anxiety and 3 for depression.",M,41,15  years25 1X D,8/23/2013Email,Paxil cr

I have been on and off of it depending on stressful situations in my life.  It does cause major weight gain but it is the only med that helps me with major anxiety.  Helps a lot with IBS also.

Very frustrating! We thought nothing of it as we had been drinking_ but a few nights later the same problem struck again and after 30mins of pounding away at my poor wife_ she said enought of that_ rolled me onto my back and had to jerk & suck me off for another 15 mins before i could eventually cum.

16, 4, Depression,Nausea_ drowsiness_ no crying_ numbness_ eye twitching_ 30 lb. weight gain,I was initially taking 12.5 mg/day for 9 months.  For the first 4 months_ I was diligent with exercising and good eating habits and actually lost weight.  During the 5th month_ I was injured and the exercising had to stop.  Interestingly enough_ I sunk back into depression and had to double the dosage by the 9th month.  When I stopped exercising_ I also started to gain weight almost instantly (20 lbs. in 5 months and then 10 more in 2 months after doubling the dosage).  I have been exercising again for the past 2 months and haven't lost a pound!!!!  However_ on the double dosage_ I am back to myself again.  Much happier_ in control_ less anxiety_ sociable_ not obsessing about things.  Not sure what to do.  Might see my doctor about going back down to 12.5 mg and continuing the exercising.,F,42,1  years12.5/25 mg 1X D,10/9/2012,Paxil cr
17, 5, Depression/Anxiety/Panic Disorder,Why are any of you taking regular Paxil? The drug has been reformulated as Paxil CR (constant release). The new formulation takes away most if not all of the side effects as the problem with regular Paxil was its short half-life (4 hours). Doctors should NOT be prescribing regular Paxil anymore. Paxil CR is an entirely different drug. Only use BRAND NAMES when it comes to AD's as the generics just don't cut it. Paxil CR 12.5 MG knocked out my depression and severe anxiety/PD within days. It's a good drug. If you need to withdraw from any SSRI use Lyrica. It's like a beta blocker for the brain and will cancel out any and all withdrawal symptoms from any SSRI/SNRI. For weight gain_ sexual dysfunction associated with this or any SSRI take the herb Rhodiola Rosea. It's a miracle herb.,,M,39,2  years12.5,6/30/2012,Paxil cr
18, 5, OCD/Panic Disorder,WEIGHT GAIN!!!!  Gained 20 pounds easily within 2 years.  Don't let anyone tell you it's not the Paxil CR.  I was a competitive runner and STILL gained weight.  I went on a 1_200 calorie diet for over a month and exercised 6x a week.  I wrote down everything I ate and DIDN'T LOSE ONE POUND!  Stopped taking Paxil CR and lost 2 pounds in one week while eating anything I wanted.,With that said_ Paxil CR eliminated my OCD symptoms.  It was wonderful in that regards but I ended up feeling depressed when month  after month I kept on gaining weight.  I stopped taking it for that reason alone.  I am  now on Villbryd and trying to see if I can lose this weight.,F,46,2  years37.5 1X D,6/11/2012Email,Paxil cr
19, 5, Anxiety (GAD_ Panic_ OCD),Slight weight gain.  Dry mouth.  Entertaining dreams.  Emotional numbness.,Was basically non functional for 6 months because of anxiety and lost 30 pounds.  Tried Lexapro and gave it 5 weeks. Only gave me headaches. Also tried Xanax and Clonopin and while they worked_ I would very quickly get rebound anxiety which put me into a spiral of hell. Finally found Paxil CR and it returned me to normal in 48 hours. Probably had the best year of my life on this drug even with intense times of stress.  Oh_ and it almost completely cured my IBS.  It does cause emotional blunting. You still feel the emotion_ you just don't yell or cry.  Tried tapering off and IBS came back.  Back on it again and back to normal.,M,40,1  years12.5 1X D,3/8/2012,Paxil cr

23, 1, GAD and Social Anxiety,,While I was taking this medicine I didn't care about anything. My emotions were completely numb_ minimal weight gain_ no interest in sex. Others noticed I was withdrawn_ but didn't say anything because they thought I was happy. When I decided after 6 years to not up my dose and actually wean off of it_ the nightmare began. I had a HUGE rush of emotions that I couldn't control that had been numb for years_ my head was fuzzy: I couldn't think_ brain zaps. It was horrible!!!! It has been almost a year since I got off of Paxil and I am still trying to pick up the pieces over the past 6 years. Including my friendships and most importantly my marriage. I DO NOT recommend this medicine or anything that resembles it like Cymbalta. I now take Buspar and have never been happier!

I have weighed 118 for as long as I can remember. I was very depressed when I first started Paxil and I'm sure that started the weight gain with increased sleeping and lack of exercise.  However_ I know it has increased my appetite tremendously. I got over the depression within a few months_ and it definitely calmed the anxiety and panic attacks.  I did not experience any side effects getting off of it and am now trying Luvox CR just because of the excessive hunger and sweating. Yuck!,F,34,1  years25mg 1X D,2/25/2011,Paxil cr
25, 4, Anxiety/drepression,Weight gain {have to watch what I eat/walk several miles 3-4x per week}_ fatigued_ Lessened sexual desire.,"Well it's hard choosing between a healthier sex life_ and lower weight_ vs. feeling high-strung_ moody_ sometimes depressed and having anxiety attacks. The thing is I don't think there's any ""perfect"" drug out there because they ALL seem to have side effects of some sort_ and guess we all just have to be our own guine pig so to speak to find out what works for you. So I've been taking Paxil for many yrs. now and it's truly helped me a great deal w/anxiety_ and if/when I feel depressed bounce back quicker than back then. Plus get behavorial therapy. I must say exercise_ yoga and taking vitamins helps too--esp. cod liver oil has helped me. So Paxil has become a part of a healthier emotional/mental life for me long ago. I've always been scared of getting off Paxil since I NEVER want to have another clinical depression as long as I live. I guess some of us just are more suseptible to this_ just as some have other illnesses they have to cope with. The thing I like least abt Paxil is my decreased sex life. And that I feel fatigued w/less energy. Perhaps 10-15mg. would be a better dosage for me than 20mg. As far as weight gain_ I'd probably have a normal weight of 130-136. But can't exercise a lot during the winter months [get way too tired during winter] so my weight sky-rockets up to 145. EEEK! Rest assured_ once the weather breaks_ it's very easy to drop 10 pds. from just keepin up on miles of walking.So_ guess I'll still be taking it since my anxiety levels dropped",F,45,15  years20mg 1X D,2/12/2011,Paxil cr

For about 6 months I couldn't sleep more than 4 hours per night_ wasn't eating_ food didn't taste or smell good. I constantly felt severe anxiety and tried so many things to feel better but nothing helped.

28, 4, PE,Lethargy.  I feel like I could stop and nap at any time during the day.  I need to keep my mind occupied or I will start nodding off.  No weight gain for me- which I've heard is pretty common.  Vivid dreams at night_ which are a nice bonus.,I actually started taking paxil to help with premature ejaculation.  I could only last a couple of minutes with my wife.  While she never complained I'm sure she was frustrated_ as was I. Since beginning Paxil_ I can last virtually as long as I want in bed- The level of ejaculatory control is amazing.  Since my wife is on prozac it takes her a long time to reach orgasm_ and I now have no problem holding off until she gets there.  Intercourse can easily last longer than 30 minutes.  Anyone out there who is suffering from PE_ I would highly recommend getting on this med.  The only downside has been the lethargy.

It made me hungry and not as motivated to exercise.,If I had to_ I would take this again. The only reason I stopped is because of the weight gain and hunger it gave me. Paxil CR saved me when I was only sleeping a few hours a night and having constant anxiety. Whatever you do_ do NOT go off of this medicine cold turkey. Do it under an experienced physician (preferably a psychiatrist). There are withdrawals. My dr had me start taking my new med while I was still on the Paxil CR and I tapered over a period of three weeks. I still felt like I had the flu for about a week.

I was eating healthier than I have my whole life and excercising more_ and the weight wouldn't come off. When I asked my dr if I could try another medication_ she suggested that I drop down from 12.5 mg to 10 mg. I did lose some weight immediately_ but some of it stuck. I finally went down to 5 mg for about a week_ then I stopped taking it altogether. I thought since I was on such a low dose and I tapered off of it_ that I wouldn't have too bad of a withdrawl. WRONG. Since I stopped Paxil_ I have felt like I have the flu - extreme dizziness_ nausea_ brain ""zaps""_ uncontrollable rage and I will cry at the drop of a hat. Someone compared the withdrawl from Paxil to a heroin withdrawl. I am on day 6 of withdrawl and finally starting to get my appetite back_ but still have the dizziness and brain zaps (I get dizzy and hear a clicking noise if I move my head too quickly or my eyes shift too quickly). I've heard withdrawl symptoms can last for weeks_ months and even years. This is a SCARY drug. Having said all that_ it really did help me with my moods while I was on it. I didn't let things bother me_ I didn't obsess over things anymore and I was much calmer overall. I didn't realize how irritable and depressed I was until I wasn't anymore.

Most symptoms from first 2 weeks went away but were replaced with; sweating_ loss of orgasm_ and the odd deep yawn.,"Paxil CR has helped me through a very difficult 3 months in my family life and work life.Prior to taking Paxil I was depressed a few times in my life and took Effexor several years ago for 4 months. It was very effective as well but no as much as the Paxil CR. I had similar side effects on Effexor_ but was able to achieve orgasm easier than on Paxil CR.Paxil CR has helped me with:1. What I call ""taken the edge off""_ not every little thing bothers me anymore.2. I've become more active and have been able to overcome any social networking issues I have_ basically I can relax around people in most situations now.3. Greatly helped me through a difficult situation in my family.4.

I didn't have horrible withdrawal when I stopped. I didn't gain weight from the medication either. I did try the generic version of Paxil CR and it didn't work at all for me_ it felt like I was taking a placebo. I need to take the Brand name or it doesn't work for me. I know everyone tells you there is no difference in generic and brand name but there is.,In reading a lot of the ratings and explanations of issues_ I notice the milligrams noted don't all correspond with Paxil CR. I'm wondering if some people are rating Paxil and not Paxil CR. There is a difference.

The weight gain is slow so I didn't associate it with the Paxil until I came off of it and the weight started to drop.  Exercise_ diet had no effect on the weight gain. Detox was HORRIBLE -- major brain zaps_ night sweats_ and upset stomach for the first two weeks_ and then joint pain for months.,It worked very well for anxiety and irratibility. Be careful if you miss even one dose because the side effects from withdrawal will set in. Once you go off of it_ be prepared for some intense withdrawal sypmtoms.  Doctors should warn people about the withdrawal before anyone starts taking it. Also_ buy some bigger clothes because you are going to get fat.  For all the good it did in relieving my other mood symptoms_ my image of myself took a huge dive because of the weight gain.

If you are depressed_ change your diet and work out like an olympic athelete; with this you can avoid post-drug side effects.

97, 4, Depression and anxiety,None that I can specifically attribute to Paxil CR,Helps me control my display of emotions.  Has a calming effect that I like.

I think I am going to try a Vitamin B12/Vitamin B6/Folic Acid supplement and hope it helps too_ because generally speaking_ my understanding of psychotropic drugs in general is that they frequently have unpredictable side effects_ sometimes do more harm than good_ and some can be addictive.  When I was taking 25 mg per day_ I had no withdrawal symptoms when I stopped taking it.

I get the chills between 10 and 15 times a day_ and this only started to occur through the withdrawl phase.  Please do not take this drug.  The withdrawl is not worth it.  I cried for about two weeks straight_ had no appetite_ and was erratic for several weeks.  I can't believe that doctors actually prescribe this horrible drug.

I took mine with depakote and all I did was sleep and get fat.  Without a mood stablizer Paxil put me into manic states followed by very violent and depressive states-not good.  Then after so long it quit doing anything at all.  I just went to a new psychiatrist and amm now on the right meds. I am on a combo of 2 antidepressants now- Lexapro and Wellbutrin XL with Geodon for my mood stablizer.  A much better combo_ I am actually starting to feel like my head is coming out of the clouds.

Everything is okay until you go off the drug.  I had pretty nasty withdrawals including the electrical ""zaps"" (reported with all ssri's)_ even more sweating_ shakiness_ GI distress_ increase in anxiety/depression(to be expected).  Withdrawals gradually got worse as I decreased dosage further.  They got bad enough where I had to go back on Zoloft(also an SSRI).  I also take seroquel which also helps with withdrawals.  They probably would have been much worse if I wasn't on anything else to help compensate.  Paxil cr is very beneficial for some people to the point where therapeutic effects outweigh side effects.  Stay on lowest dose as possible to minimize possible adverse effects if it if effective for you.  It has been reported the paxil/cr is the worst ssri in terms of sexual side effects and withdrawals(next to effexor an SNRI) and I experienced both of these  (these effects are very inconvienent for young men like myself)",M,20,4  months,1/24/2007,Paxil cr

I havent had trouble with anxiety for 6 years_ so when the panic started again_ it was surprising and frustrating bc I have overcome so much-so this is why I feel this is such a great medication-it has helped me with my PMS and my irritablilty_ hopefully the sexual side effects will lessen-thank goodness I have an understanding husband.

I am currently tapering off of the drug and have had withdrawal symptoms(37.5mg-25mg-12.5mg...).  Since tapering off the drug_ I have had an even more intense craving for alcohol along with the usual withdrawals (increased depression/anxiety_ shakiness_ tingling_ and a general feeling ofdistress.)  I don't feel like myself right now.  I also take seroquel_ which I know is helping with withdrawal symptoms.(I've been taking seroquel for a long time_ before I was on paxil cr).  I can't imagine what it's like to go off of paxil without something to augment the withdrawal process.  Paxil/paxil cr may be beneficial for some people_ but don't take it unless it's you must_ that is after trying other SSRI's (zoloft_ celexa_ prozac_ etc).

She said to fill the RX for Paxil and we'd change my meds at next appt. I was at 37.5 mg Paxil. We started to taper down. She didn't tell me what I might experience during withdrawal. It was horrifying. I felt like I was dying_ but knew I wasn't. I was terrified_ and didn't know what to do. ER wouldn't treat me because I wasn't in life-threatening danger. I made calls to my doc_ all times day/night. A nurse I spoke with said Paxil doesn't cause any [side effects/withdrawal].

211, 1, DEPRESSION,FIRST THREE DAYS I DID NOT DREAM_ WHICH FOR ME WAS STRANGE. THEN DAY 5 THE ANGER_ DESPAIR_ AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR STARTED. I AM BY NATURE A SWEET CALM PERSON_ BUT I EXPLODED EVERY FEW MINUTES. I THREW THINGS_ I CRIED_ I CURSED (WHICH I DON'T DO) I THOUGHT ABOUT SUICIDE WHICH I DID NOT DO WHILE ON ZOLOFT OR LEXAPRO. I SWEAR THAT IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN A GUN I WOULD HAVE USED IT. THAT IS HOW OUT OF CONTROL THIS STUFF MADE ME. I AM A QUIET 50 YEAR OLD LADY WITH NO VIOLENT PAST OR TEDNDENCIES. I THREW BY BOTTLE AWAY AND CALLED MY DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A REACTION. AT LEAST WITH ZOLOFT ALL I DID WAS HAVE NOSE BLEEDS (WHICH I WAS TOLD THAT IS UNUSUAL FOR A SIDE EFFECT TOO)  I AM HOPING THAT NO ONE ELSE EVER SUFFERS THIS WAY.,,F,50,5  days,6/1/2006,Paxil cr
212, 5, panic attacks_ depression,nausea_ drowsiness at first_ lack of libedo and organsim,paxil has been a miricle cure.  I began having panic attacks that became so extreme I was unable to work or even leave my home.  I have tried many antidepressents_ but the side effects were to unbearable to handle and the releif was minimal.  I have even lost weight with out trying to.  It really helped cure my hunger_ that was due mostly to depression.  I would like and info from other users on lack of  orgasim and ways to releave this side effect.  Also has anyone taken this med while pregnant?  Was the baby ok?  My husband and I would like to have a baby_ but I am afraid of the panic attacks returning.thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!,F,34,1  years,5/29/2006Email,Paxil cr
213, 3, Depression / Anxiety,Tiredness_ nausea_ libido low_ no orgasms_ heart palpatations or occassional anxiety (can't tell),I am very sensitive to all medications - particurally the ones for depression_ so I started out taking the CR at 12.5 every other day for a week.  Then I tried to take it every day for two weeks_ but I could not tolerate the drowsiness.  I felt really drugged.  I had a hard time getting up in the mornings_ and it stayed with me all day.  The tiredness was making me irritable.  Plus I had nausea for a few days. I had to cut back to every other day again_ but it was working. I was feeling good for a while with more energy and a positive attitude. But my symptoms came back.  Today I started taking it every day again_ and I'm tryng to take it in the morning instead of at night.   After reading about the terrible experiences of people coming off of this_ I am concerned. I cannot get back into my doc until July to talk to her about it. I was thinking that this could be the 1st med to work for me.  I've been depressed for most of my life.  I want to feel better. Hasn't anyone been weened off,F,39,5  weeks,5/25/2006,Paxil cr

All of those side effects were gone within the first month or two and now I just have a slightly decreased libido_ but that doesn't bother me_ because now it matches my husband's libido exactly!,I was placed on Paxil primarily for the constant obsessive thoughts that come with my severe OCD.  I would have done anything to get rid of them.  I was in a major depression and have Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder_ as well.  The OCD was getting worse as I got older and I couldn't handle it anymore.  The Paxil worked within a month.  I now almost never have the obsessive thoughts.  I wasn't much into the idea of taking meds before_ but now I'm VERY GRATEFUL!!!  I'm also in counseling and am able to make better progress because of the Paxil CR.,F,35,6  months,5/8/2006,Paxil cr
217, 1, Paxil,Self harm_ suicidal tendencies_ restless_ extreme mood swings,My daughter was prescribed paxil at age 7 1/2.  This medication should not be given to any child.  When it was finally realized her problems stemmed from the paxil_ the withdrawal was horrendous to say the least.  She literally was not able to function for a very long time.My daughter was prescribed paxil because of a school incident to get her over the shock.  It lead her down a road of numerous mental health labels_ loss of health_ education and friends.Now paxil free she once again is a happy child_ the mood swings disappeared_ the suicidal tendencies and self harm....disappeared. With the stop of this medication the mental health labels magically disappeared as well.Once again a happy child leading a normal life.  GlaxoSmithKline needs to let the public know the truth about this medication so docs and patients know what to look out for.  The withdrawal of this medication for many is a horrendous experience leaving the patients thinking their mental health is breaking do,F,10,2  days,5/3/2006,Paxil cr

That day_ I drank enough to necessitate going to the bathroom 20 times while at work. I'd been on Zoloft many years ago and knew that you need to taper off if you've been taking ADs for a while_ but since I'd only taken three pills_ I didn't think that was necessary. Boy was I wrong. Within a few hours of missing the next pill_ I became very nauseous and agitated. My brain couldn't focus long enough to put together a complete thought_ and I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. It was so bad that I wound up in the Emergency Department.

I was in a bad relationship years ago and never told anyone about what when on_ then it crept up on me to the point of insanity.  I lost so much weight from these horrible thoughts that I kept on thinking to the point that my family made me go on meds.  I started on paxil 12.5 in January 2006 and started feeling better in like a week.  I uped to 37.5 mg then went back down to 25.  This drug helped me so much.  I actually slept a full night.  I didn't run to the doctor everyday obsessing over things_ and stopped snapping at everyone.  I got married and have been on it for 1 yr and want to start having a baby in the next year or so_ so i am going to slowly wean myself off.  I gained 10 while being on this drug_ hopefully it will come off sone.  If anyone has any tips on weaning off the meds_ or if you lost the weight you gained on it contact me.

In fact it may have helped too much as I became extremely unconcerned about things that used to worry me. I was reminded that a little worry can be a good thing. It did help my seasonal depression_ though. I would have continued it but the heart palpitations were a little scary. Also_ I became an extreme alcoholic while on it. I drank every night and really enjoyed it. As soon as I went off this drug I returned to my old moderately drinking self.

If I could recall these dreams and put them on paper..I would make more money than Stephen King. I gained weight. 80Lbs. Didn't really feel much better until I incorporated exercise (intense martial arts training). A combination of the medication_ years of therapy (people must remember that therapy is important.) and the exercise. I felt like I finally was a live...unfortunatly that didn't happen until age 39 or 40,"I started out on Paxil HR (regualar paxil) it was a life saver once I was on the right dose. 60mg by year 2 or 3. I would have surely committeed suicide without it. Now I am on the Paxil CR and I am not really happy with the results. I just don't care about anything. I have gained 30 lbs. and I don't feel like I have the energy to work out. My Dr. just increased the dose from 75MG to 100MG. I started the increased dose yesterday. When I woke up after sleeping form almost 12 hours...I had ""visual trails"" It feel like I am hallucinating. Reported this to Dr. She suggests I continue with the increased dose and to see what happens. I had to change to Paxil CR because the Pharmacutical company is giving me my meds free of charge and they are not producing paxil brand anymore.

I have taken over the years different ssri's such as regular paxil_ celexa and lexapro.  all however_ do still seem to be weight gainers.  i think the difference with the paxil cr is the controlled release part which must upset my bowel system.,,F,58,6  weeks,12/18/2005,Paxil cr

Disbelievers will call it the placebo effect but I know how my body and adrenaline works. The only reason I stopped taking Paxil CR is b/c of wanting to get pregnant.I've never ever used any anti-depressants before and I was surprised at the wonderful results from PaxilCR.I started at 12.5 and went up to 25mg. Despite it's side effects_ it really helped my anxiety_ especially while driving. After weaning off of Paxil_ I realized that if Paxil could calm me down_ I could actually BE calm and now driving doesn't bother me much. I have more self confidence and I have to say 'THANKS PaxilCR!' The weaning process was a little irritating (nausea_ dizzyness_tingling)but nothing horrible although I only took it a short time. Everybody will have a different reaction to drugs_ but I was very happy with PaxilCR and would recommend it. Just remember_ you can't get something for nothing.

Be prepped for w/d_ it can be bad but if you have learned natural ways to cope you will be okay soon again.  Don't take the benzos for more than a cou[ple of months.  Dont take the paxil.

I have been searching for sites to praise paxil..almost everything I see is all the negative side effects. Paxil is the best decision I've ever made. I had horrible social anxiety..felt like people were watching me..I had depression..I was always sad and down..I took this and within days I began to feel emotional relief. I am so thankful my doctor put me on this. I only had side effects for less than a week when I started on it..and its been wonderful ever since. I've not gained any weight either...I learned that it has to do w/ your natural metabolism determining whether or not it makes you gain weight. I have always been naturally thin all my life_ and it has not affected me at all. I love it!! I feel much more confident_ always happy..and not moddy like I used to be.

I burned myself out to the point where my body could not tolerate stress anymore_ and I had anxiety symptoms for about 4 months_ and then a couple of panic attacks. Paxil is getting the neurotransmitors in my brain balanced again. I have only been on paxil for almost 4 weeks_ and I already notice a great improvement. The only bothersome side effect is decreased libido and sexual orgasmic climax is much more difficult,Don't be discouraged when you first start taking it - it sucks pretty bad - wait it out though_ and I'm sure you'll agree it's totally worth it.,F,22,27  days,10/8/2005,Paxil cr

261, 5, Depression_ Anxiety Attacts,No noticable side effects.,I saw an advertisement on TV about Paxil and thought I should give it a try.  It took 2 appointments with my psychiatrist to convince him to let me evaluate the drug.  I took my first 20mg pill in August of 1999_ and felt IMMEDIATE results.  I used to be unable to go to the store because of anxiety attacts.  Paxil very promptly corrrected that matter_ and has been the ONLY drug capable to doing that.  Not even the benzodiazepines could work that well!  Prior to Paxil_ I used Elavil for years_ and thought that was the only antidepressant that would work for me_ but I discovered that Paxil works better.  I have been using the 20mg or 25mg CR pill for the past 6 years_ will no reason to escalate the dosage.  I rank it as a very effective antidepressant as well as a panic-control drug.,M,43,6  years,9/14/2005Email,Paxil cr

274, 4, Depression/Loss of a loved one,When starting this medication I had no side effects.  I actually adpated to the medicine easily. However going off of the paxil CR is a different story.,The Paxil CR 25 did help me get through my depression_but I remained on the drug longer than I should have. Had I known that I would become addicted to the medication I would not have taken it in the first place. As you all know the Paxil has been banned_ and I was switched to paroxetine the generic version.  I broke out in a rash_ and had to stop taking the medication. So I quit cold turkey. It has now been a week since I have taken the Paxil/Paroxetine_ and I am experiencing severe withdrawls.  I am throwing up_ dizzy_ sensitive to sounds_ agitated_ loss of apetite_ night tremors_ weird dreams_ panic attacks_ boats of crying episodes_ and weird eye movements. Anyone that has experienced this and has successfully gotten off the drug I would like to hear from you.  I need support.  I did end up in the ER_ but all they wanted to do was put me on Luvox. I do not want to take another medication so I can get addicted_ and go through these horrible withdrawls. The doctors all wanted to fix me short term and would not admit me to watch me get off of the Paxil. I am looking at the long term. That is sad_ that the ER would not help me. I was told that I was relapsing_ and I dont believe that was the case. It is the withdrawls.  I know that I dont need the medication_ and want to get off of it to be drug free.  There are better ways than getting addicted to medication. If I had known 3 years ago what I know now_ I would not have gotten on the medication. Please do research_ and think twice before starting the medication. If you want a good read on it get the book called your drug may be your problem how and why to stop taking psychiatric medications by Peter R. Breggin_ MD and David Cohen_ Ph.D. It is agonizing trying to get off the drug.

I gained 40 lbs on this.,I have been on Prozac (felt irrational)_ Effexor (gained 70 lbs)_ Zoloft (still anxious) and now this.  Paxil has the worst side effects for coming off.  If anyone has successfully got off Paxil CR please email me and tell me how.  I am so desperate and do not know if I can make it through these withdrawl symptoms but I will not go back on something that is making my brain feel like jello and I sleep like 14 hours a day and work.  Still no social life. Please HELP me!,F,27,1  years,8/23/2004Email,Paxil cr

386, 5, Depression/anxiety,The only side effect I have is sleepiness.  I yawn alot.  I am starting to feel like myself again. I did have some abdominal cramping but I don't know if that is the paxil CR_ or the Mexican food I had that day.,I am still a little slow in the mornings but I am starting to see a slight difference in how I think and worry about things. The real side effect that I haven't experienced yet_ but that really bothers me _is the sexual side effects.  I am getting married in March/2005 and want a healthy sex life.  Loss of libido is not what I need right now.  If anyone has found out what to do in this situation it would be greatly appreciated by me and my Fiance.  As for all of the other side effects_ I haven't experienced any that are intolerable.  I thnk anyone taking an SSRI should undestand that there are going to be side effects and withdrawal symptoms_ and just make sure you read about what is available and make your decision based on what you are trying to accomplish.

387, 4, Depression & Anxiety,Diarreah the first week_ major weight gain (15lbs)_ tired_ lack of energy.  My doctor changed my prescription to Wellbutrin and am having horrible withdrawals to the Paxcil...dizziness and naseau.,The Paxcil Cr worked great for the first year and then it kind of stopped working.  My doctor said that Paxcil has a tendency to stop working for some people and I am one of the lucky ones.

Here what I am experiencing:Insomnia with very wierd and strange dreams (many of these something or someone is after me);crawling skin_ this is worse of all_ it is accompanied by a hypervenalation type feeling_ in this state I am completely misberbly. Hallucinations at night when waking (not knowing where I am); the pulse sensation_ where you turn you head and you feel like a wave or waves of dizziness pass though you head;  ear pulses too_ same thing but I have short sporadic noises like a TV with no channel.  Overall_ out of control emotions especially when the crawling effect is going.  I have left work twice for the day because I was on the verge of collaspe and could not communicate with my clients.,Don't do it or if you do you better need to anti-anxiety relief badly.  I got talked into it by my family doctor during a tough time at work.

DON'T DRINK WHHILE TAKING... I would get wild if I drank any alcohol_ for the most part the medication helped me a great deal.  Started off on 12.5 mgs ... after two weeks went to 25 mgs because could still feel a panic attack approaching... then for the next two to three weeks I would have anxietyor panic attacks but they were very surpressed and controllable... stoped having anxiety and panick attacks completely since then... HOWEVER... 2 weeks ago I went back to the 12.5 mgs. and am going to try to withdrawl all together because I have become so fat and I am tired of sleeping 12 hours a day.  We will see.. so far I have had pretty bad vertigo_ dizziness_ brain shocks_ wild wild dreams (not nightmares though) and terrible headaches.Hope to be Paxcil CR free by November 1st.

Also the weight gain thing I was not aware of_ I just thought I had gained weight but the thing is I dont eat bad or a lot_ so now I know why I gained weight.

397, 4, OCD_ BDD_ Self-Mutilation,The first 2 weeks_ I was very spacey.  I was also very apathetic.  I had decreased appetite.  I immediately spent less time grooming_ mostly because I was so spacey I didn't put much effort into anything.  HOWEVER_ after those initial weeks_ I started feeling completely normal_ except I no longer had severe OCD/BDD/SM habits (I used to spend 5 hours a day grooming_ now I only spend 1).  Give the Paxil a chance; if I had judged based on the first 2 weeks_ I'd have sworn that it made me feel worse.  But now I feel much better than before.  I may have gained a few pounds_ but I was underweight before.  I think I'm closer to normal weight now.  I've never had an eating disorder_ I just come from a thin family.,I don't remember what I felt like before Paxil.  I would say that the Paxil makes me feel really sleepy_ because I want to sleep all the time_ but I know I was like that before the Paxil too.  I wanted to sleep all the time before_ and I want to sleep all the time now.  It's because I don't get enough sleep because I'm really busy.  It's also because I never exercise_ which means my serotonin is lower than it could be.  Also_ my husband says I'm SO MUCH NICER to him than I was before Paxil.  I don't remember being really mean to him before_ but he says I was.  I don't plan to stop taking the Paxil for a while.  I guess I'll have to stop when we have kids_ which is still a few years away.  As of now_ I recommend Paxil_ but I may be singing a different tune once I need to stop taking it.  I've had OCD symptoms as long as I can remember_ and I've had BDD almost as long.  I began SM around the age of 13.  I've only began seeking help for all this within the last 6 months.  I've got a long way to go before I'll see the long-term benefits of the assistance I've sought.,F,26,5  months,7/27/2004,Paxil cr
398, 5, anxiety and insomnia,weight gain_ decreased libido and difficulty reaching orgasm,The insomnia was killing me! I was so anxious and my mind was always racing. I got on Paxil CR for insomnia/anxiety and it has done wonders. . . I sleep like a normal person now! I am also less on-edge with my kids and husband. I started with the 12.5 mg dose and after 2 weeks increased to 25mg. I've been at this dose for about a year.,F,36,1  years,7/24/2004,Paxil cr
399, 4, Depression/Anxiety,brief light nausea at beginning_ which was to be expected by the nature of the drug (SSRI)_ but not unmanageable; inability to orgasm; lethargy--absolutely had to take naps_ not optional; *extremely deep-plunging depression with suicidal thoughts when I missed two doses one weekend*,Paxil CR helped me immensely and made interacting with others signficantly easier.  I worried about sleeping so much; before_ that was a side-effect of my depression_ always staying in bed.  I also noticed that I didn't recall any dreams I had when I was on Paxil--strange_ because my doctor warned me to expect vivid dreams as a possible side effect.  Although I may have slept more soundly when on Paxil_ it puzzled me that I felt the strong need to sleep during the day_ even for a few hours.  I did feel like life was much more manageable while on the Paxil_ though.  ***One caution--be careful not to miss more than one dose in a row!  Maybe not even that...when I didn't take it for one weekend_ I started cutting my arm and leg (something I'd never done before) and having irrationally desparate thoughts of suicide.*** I stopped taking Paxil after my prescription ran out_ and although I plan to go back on some anti-depressant soon_ I may ask my doctor to consider something other than Paxil CR.  It worked for me in terms of helping me deal with my depression and anxiety_ but I think there might be something else out there that won't make me quite so lethargic.  If nothing else works better_ I'll return to Paxil CR without hesitation.  :-),F,21,5  weeks,7/24/2004Email,Paxil cr

I felt a little sick to my stomach yesterday too.  When will this feeling stop?? It has been a week since I have lowered my dosage.  Is there anyone out there that has successfully gone off of this drug?  I am worried that I will keep gaining weight and not be able to go off of this.  I am going to continue lowering my dosage until I have completely gone off of this.

443, 3, depression and anxiety,not many side effects going on when I started. This time I have gained 25 pounds in a year.,I started taking Paxil in 1995 for depression and anxiety. I was up to 30mg at one time but changed doses a bit during the coarse of treatment and decided to go off of it sometime in 1998. I do not remember having any problems going off of it then_ I just remember I tapered myself rather quickly down and only experienced minor electrical shock feelings and slight anxiety. Because my experience with Paxil was so benign the first time_ when I started having anxiety problems again back about a year ago_ I started taking 10mg of Paxil. About 3 weeks ago I decided I wanted to stop taking it for a while and tapered a bit like I had before for a few days. This time the experience was 100% different. I had EXTREME headaches_ constant anxiety_ painful electric shocks_ INTENSE fatigue (awake for 3 hrs and exhausted)_felt like I was dying and was constantly crying. I didn't even think it was from the cessation of Paxil because I never had this problem before. I thought that I must be developing some other medical problem. I then looked up on the internet and saw that some people have major withdrawal going off paxil. I took pill of Paxil immediately and within 4 hrs I felt like new- FOUR HOURS and I felt better than I had in years. So there obviously is some addiction/dependance that goes on with this drug and it is somehow related to other factors (being that I had severe withdrawal this time and nothing last time I went off). If anyone has had a similar experience I would like to here about it. It scares me to think I am addicted to something. thanks,F,28,14  months,4/15/2004Email,Paxil cr

It isn't just hard to remember to take them_ it is also hard to just get them down.  I have been trying to wean myself off because I cannot handle it anymore. I feel great all the time_ that is until my body decides it is having withdrawls from the paxil cr.I have been trying to wean myself off for a few months now and I experience double vision_ entire body shocks_ numbness_ sleepiness_ and migranes. I don't recommend to anyone to do this by yourself_ it is extremely painful!! I can now go 3-4 days without taking the drug_ but by the time the 5th day hits i am miserable and have to take another dose. I hate this drug.,Only get on Paxil CR if you wanna stay on it forever!!! Don't get on this drug unless you really need it.

453, 4, Panic Attacks/Anxiety Disorder,For the first week I physically could not eat.  Everytime I put food in my mouth_ my throat would close off.  I would spend hours a day dry-heaving as well.  I lost 10 pounds in the first 10 days I was on the medicine and experienced worse anxiety than I did before I was put on the drug.  I also missed several days of work and became dehydrated and was almost hospitalized.  Other side effects that I experienced were horrible night sweats_ strange and vivid dreams_ body jerks_ no sex drive what so ever_ inability to achieve orgasm_ extreme exhaustion (I would have to sleep 10-12 hours a night just to be able to get out of bed) and I also felt dizzy at times and often felt confused.  After the initial weight loss I then gained 20 pounds and was unable to take any of it off.,While the panic attacks did cease (which I am grateful for) I wish that I would have never taken the drug.  I was only on the 12.5 CR because the 25 caused me to sweat and I became very jittery.  I began drinking heavily while on the medication for no real apparent reason.  With the excessive drinking_ the weight gain (I went from 110 to 130lbs) and the lack of sex drive (I am a newlywed) I began to experience severe depression.  I was also bothered by the inability to feel certain emotions - sadness or anger when needed.  Just recently I started to get off of the Paxil because I couldn't take effects of the medicine anymore.  I took the 12.5 every other day for two weeks and then stopped taking it all together.  The side effects were a complete nightmare - extreme anxiety_ severe mood swings (bouts of extreme sadness or anger)_ dizziness_ and nausea.  I am terrified that this drug could have caused some sort of damage to my body or brain and I regret taking it.  On the bright side_ my sex drive is coming back_ and I am not exhausted anymore.  I have only been completely off of it for 2 weeks now and the side have decreased significantly.  I just pray that the weight will come off quickly.  Please contact me if you experienced the weight gain and if you were able to lose it.,F,27,6  months,3/24/2004Email,Paxil cr

456, 1, depression,I experienced a good change in the first couple of months. However_ after the first couple months I noticed that the drug put me in a state of euphoria. I thought I was great I thought others were beneath me. I had an urge to binge drink. Drinking alcohol is a big no no with this drug. I felt very self destructive. I had become very hostile. I hated myself. I feel alot better now that I'm off the drug. But still to this day if I consume alcohol I find my behavior to be very erratic.

Nothing mattered but sleep.  I would often fall asleep and nap just 3-4 hours after waking up.  I would even pull over while driving sleep in parking lots for over an hour. I also completely lost my libido.  I was only interested in sex every couple weeks at most and would go weeks without ever even thinking about it.

I am approximately on month 4 and I feel a little SEXUAL DESIRE COMMING BACK. HOWEVER_ MY DRIVE IS NO WHERE NEAR THE ANIMAL THAT I USED TO BE.,Drinking alcohol with this drug is very dangerous. I live a life where I am out at dance clubs and bars every weekend with friends. When I first started taking Paxil_ I had a situation where I went into comotose from drinking. Since that_ there have been many nights where I lose all feelings of reality and blackout. Usually I can't remember what happened to me the night before. Its actually kind of cool_ because I get to listen to my friends telling me what we did the night before at the club_ and I cant remember sh*t! I would say that if you go out regularly to bars and hang with a bunch of guys that like to party (like I do) then be careful how much you drink. Its like one second you think that you are fine_ then the next you wake up on the street curb_ or on the floor of a friends apartment_ and you cant remember how you got there. I would recommend that if you want to go out and get drunk_ then make sure that you always have your friends by your side_ because you never know when your going to  black out and comotose.... All you do know is that it WILL happen BEFORE last call for alcohol at the club. The sexual side effects are still there a little_ but they are improving slowly. Ultimately_ things are better emotionally_ and I feel as if I will attempt to go off Paxil CR soon.,M,24,4  months,9/23/2003,Paxil cr

I then started on Paxil CR (37.5) due to a severe return of panic attacks.  I have been taking this for a year and have experienced the worst of the side effects for the last 2 1/2 months.  I have experienced a twitching/buzzing/electrical shock sensation in my head which is sometimes compounded with heart racing_dizziness and confusion.  I frequently wake at night with these symptoms which are very similar to sypmtoms of panic attacks themselves.  My gp suggested to increase my dosage 2 1/2 months ago thinking my complaints were due to more panic attacks.  I believe this med builds up in your body.

I bite my tongue in my sleep and grind my teeth and it hurts. I now have to take my dose at night before bed along with a sleep aid (Ambien)and I skip all the side effects except for loss of appetite.

Finally after the 2nd day of this burning some feelings began to come back to my legs.  The Dr. told me to never take an SSRI again_ he believes it was an allergic reaction_ without the appearance of hives.  The feeling took about 8 days to completely go away_ but it lessened considerably after those 2 days.  It was very scary.,According to the pharmacist my experence with the CR is only about 1% of people taking the drug.  I also think if I had it to do over again I would have rather been on regular Paxil_ because that wears off after 24 hours.  The CR builds up in your body and stays in there for a lot longer.,F,30,3  days,11/6/2002Email,Paxil cr

550, 5, panic attacks & depression,Side effects included: decrease in appetite(I lost 10 lbs in the first 3 weeks)_ dizziness_ sleepiness_ yawning_ moments of mental block or confusion_ dry mouth_ and at times people would comment on my dialated pupils. All the side effects subsided after 3-4 weeks.,I was suffering from severe panic attacks and depression (for more than a year)prior to taking paxil cr. My anxiety and depression immediately improved once I started the meds. The side effects eventually went away... and so did the depression and anxiety for the most part. I feel like my old self again. If I forget to take the meds in the morning_ by afternoon I start to get a headache_ but It goes away after I take the missed dose.I would highly recommend this drug to anyone suffering from panic attacks (& depression). I would also recommend combining it with therapy. I have my life back!!,F,30,5  months,10/31/2002,Paxil cr

552, 1, Mild Anxiety,Inceased Anxiety_ emotional mood swings,I took this drug for two days. From the time I started taking itmy anxiety increased 3 fold accompanied by extreme emotional mood swings. Was taking Klonopin half of a .5 mg tab about  3 times a week for mild anxiety that would surface occassionally. Thought it would be good to go on a therapeutic medication to try and halt the mild anxiety all together but after two days of greatly increased anxiety I am going to stop.,M,31,2  days,10/7/2002,Paxil cr
553, 1, depression_ anxiety disorder,Very tired and apathetic. Horribly nauseated with loss of appetite.Also have been more anxious than before. Have lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks of taking this medication due to not being able to eat.,Though I have not taken the medication for very long_ I don't think I can get past the side effects. I feel worse than I did before_ and have stopped taking it.This is actually my 2nd time trying this drug_ but again have been unable to try to see it through due to side effects_ which disappoints me_ as from what I have read_ and from what my doctor told me_ Paxil CR is supposed to have fewer side effects than the regular Paxil.,F,39,2  weeks,10/7/2002,Paxil cr

555, 5, Anxiety & OCD (mild),"For the first few weeks_ many including: lack of ability to concentrate_ ""mental fogginess""_ poor sleep_ constipation_ sleepiness (from lack of sleep at night) sexual function (ability to maintain erection_ no climax). Now_ after six weeks of use_ everything is fine except sleep pattern is not quite back to normal and I still have poor sexual function. Actually_ my erection is fine_ but it takes a long time (sometimes/often never) to climax. I'm going to ride this out longer to see if the sexual function returns. The drug is so good_ I'm hesitant to change anything.",It really did a good job for me. At least in my case_ you have to give the drug a few weeks for the side effects to subside.,M,43,6  weeks,9/16/2002,Paxil cr
556, 5, depression,I have had none.,I am so happy with this med_ and I really think this is me talking not just the meds.  I thought I couldn't stopped taking something else_ I though it was my life line_ I had been on it for over 3 yrs and my doctor suggested trying something else which was Paxil Cr and it has been the best chance I've taken in a long time. :),,23,1  months,9/13/2002,Paxil cr

559, 4, depression,Different side effects at different times. At night a little anxious and in the mornings when I take it I get a little forgetfull.,Really helped gety me out of my depression. Iam now able to get out of bed without a fight and feeling already overwhelmed. I have found that NOT telling friends can be a good idea. I have recieved mixed comments from friends. It is best not to have to explaine everything to everyone and rummors always cause issues,M,29,3  weeks,9/9/2002,Paxil cr
560, 4, Depression and Anxiety,Dry mouth in the morning mostly_ loss of appetite but that's coming back after a few weeks of being on it_ not sleeping well and tired all the time.,I can tell that I'm feeling better with the depression and anxiety_ but I dread the mornings because I feel so tired and zombie like when I drive to work.

561, 4, depression/anxiety,needed to nap during the day for the first week and there is absolutely NO sexual desire at all.  Other than that there are no other side effects for me.,I had reservations about continuing this medication when I read about the extreme side effects coming off this drug.  I decided to go ahead and keep taking it because it took away the severe depression and anxiety after the second day. I don't know what will happen when I do attempt to come off Paxil CR_ but I will have faith that things won't be that bad since I don't have many side effects.,F,32,3  weeks,8/5/2002,Paxil cr

567, 2, depression/g.a.d,extreme fatigue.  was taking 25 mg/day for first 2 mo. then went to 12.5 mg/day.  delayed orgasm which is fine b/c I often had premature ejaculation. Weight gain (20 lbs in 3 months) Do take viagra when needed for e.d.,I initially was on 300 mg/day wellbutrin sr for depression but still had some g.a.d. after 4 months. this was cut to 150mg/day with 12.5mg/day of paxil cr for the anxiety.  I was then taken of wellbutrin and put on 25mg/day paxil cr.  The paxil was wonderful for the anxiety but all I wanted to do was sleep.  I was constantly falling asleep on the job and did nothing but sleep at home which upset my wife b/c it was as if I were doped up on downers all the time. It was even hard for me to drive and stay awake at times. I was on paxil cr for about 3 mo.  I've now gone back to 300mg/day wellbutrin sr combined with 100/mg viagra for my erectile dysfuction.  The only downer about Wellbutrin SR is that when I initially was taking it_ I lost almost 20 lbs. the in 4 months and I eat like a horse.  I was 6 feet tall & 173 lbs and dropped to 153 lbs.  When I went on Paxil I gained it almost all back. I don't need to lose weight but I'll take it over feeling doped up on paxil all of the time.  Wellbutrin is great for depression and gives me a quality of life but just adds a tinge of anxiety to me.,M,41,3  months,7/16/2002Email,Paxil cr

575, 2, anxiety/depression,I've always had stomach trouble- Paxil CR just made it worse with wave after wave of nausea.  Makes the day drag by when you are drowsy_ too.
