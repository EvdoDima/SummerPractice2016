0, 5, Sjogrens,I love love love this medication. No more painful sex or cottonmouth!!! I can eat food without choking on a dry ball of mush and I no longer dip my cookies in water. I still can't leave the house without a glass of water- so the car being filled with empty cups issue unfortunately_ is not resolved. Anyways I am sensitive to meds.. The first month I was constantly nauseous but I stuck it out and after that no issues. Just carry snacks in your bag or whatever and eat a few bites of food with it. Good luck ❤️,,F,24,3  years,5/25/2014Email,Pilocarpine hydrochloride
1, 5, dry mouth and mucus membranes,None,This makes my mouth more moist_ and reduces yeast infections due to lack of moisture.  I don't want to be without this med!,F,36,2  years5 mg 4X D,1/27/2013,Pilocarpine hydrochloride
2, 3, Sjorgren's Syndrome,Profuse sweating about 35-45 minutes after taking followed by nausea for over 6 hours. With the sweating_ however_ comes the saliva. I feel like Tim Allen in the Christmas with the Cranks movie when he had the botox and can't drink the water without it dripping from his mouth. I'm not drooling though!,,F,49,3  weeks5 mg 3X D,1/7/2013,Pilocarpine hydrochloride
3, 5, SJORGREN'S SYNDROME,I haven't had any side effects which amazes me because I'm very ultra sensitive to medications. I'm taking one {4 times a day.} It helps to relieve my super dry mouth especially when I'm trying to have a conversation. I've had a dry mouth for so long it's a relief to have a normal amount of saliva. I've gone so long without having any saliva that it took me awhile to get use to having any. I had a huge grin on my face the other day while I was concentrating on my computer work because I actually drooled. Thankfully I was at home and not in public! There's nothing like a woman walking around town drooling with a big smile on her face. It's a blessing to have any sort of saliva. I feel badly for the people who have experienced side effects with this particular medication. I realize that no two bodies react the same_ but Salagen is working great for me. I would recommend this medication to others if they are able to tolerate it :-),,F,60,1  months5mg. 4X D,1/26/2011Email,Pilocarpine hydrochloride
