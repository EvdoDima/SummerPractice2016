1, 5, seizure control,Gum overgrowth_ possible psychosis when level is too high. agitation. irritable_ fatigue,Dilantin has stopped nocturnal seizures_ some partials_ and may have reduced the overall number.  Unfortunately_ it is often elevated by other meds and when this happens there are psychological impacts_ gum overgrowth and many other side effects that aren't positive.  Still_ it's been more successful than without it.  Dilantin is normally the primary med for some and has required at least one add-on.,M,50,27  years330 1X D,7/4/2016,Dilantin

4, 5, Epilepsy,At first I couldn't take it_ it was making me sick and feeling funny. After a couple of months it worked perfect.,If your doctor tells you to take Dilantin_ no matter how you feel_ continue. Don't forget to take this medication_ take it daily. The good news is once your used to it you should be able to take it once a day_ in the morning. I went from a failure at high school to becoming a dispatcher for a huge company. i also wrote programs for the company. This is all due to the help  of dilantin. Once your on your level you will find that if something very important is about to come up such as a meeting_ one extra pill will zoom you in and focus you. Agree with this medication and you may be seizure free for years.,M,59,40  years400mg 1X D,5/5/2016Email,Dilantin

6, 5, grand mal seizures,I was put on 300 mg of Dilantin at age 16 for seizures but after a week or so_ it was reduced to 200 mg when I exhibited toxicity to it.    I have osteopenia but so did my mother_ and two of my sisters so I can not say that Dilantin has caused it.  According to an MRI done at Mayo in Rochester_ I have moderate cerebral shrinkage.  This accounts for some of my unsteadiness at times and I realize this is a side effect of Dilantin.  However at age 65_ many people have an unsteady gait so I again can not say that Dilantin did that to me.  I do not have any gum overgrowth.  I have some elevation in my ALK Phosphatase count but not enough that my neuro is concerned about it.,"At the age of 16_ I felt my life was over when I started having seizures.  Dilantin gave me my life back so that I could function normally and I married and had two sons.  No one ever told me of the side effects until after my second son was born and thank God that both of them were spared any birth defects.  I do seem to metabolize Dilantin differently and need to keep my levels up above 20 to avoid a seizure.  Just this week I learned that Dilantin is also measured in ""free"" levels  and that as long as they are between 1 and 2_ I am in the normal range.  That is still confusing to me as my last reading was 32.2 with free level at 1.7.  Along with the knowledge of my neuro_ I have lowered my dosage from 260 to 230.  He hates Dilantin because it is so hard to keep a balance on levels especially as we age.  For now_ I have no plans to switch to another drug because Dilantin has kept me safe from seizures and all drugs have side effects.  In a perfect world_ I would not have to take any drugs at all.",F,65,49  years230 1X D,2/26/2016Email,Dilantin

Every few years I have an EEG which has always shown some abnormal activity so Drs have kept me on Dilantin since I was about 17. Twice over the years I've come up toxic on blood work and had levels temporarily decreased. I've always considered the side effects worth being seizure free until this year. For the past several months I've been having trouble with being able to concentrate on things that require hand/eye coordination...like typing or sewing.. without developing a jerky muscle spasm. It also happens sometimes when the sun's extremely bright. It doesn't last long but when it does I have to stop what I'm doing and live in fear that it's a seizure coming on.

As are many people_ I'm uncertain as to the bioavailability of the new formulation_ although I am also aware that this varies greatly between patients. Final comment: If nothing else works and side effects are minimal_ the duration of use should be 5 years maximum for patients like myself (well-controlled idiopathic generalized seizure syndrome).

Effects are different for everyone_ this does not mean everything I said here will happen_ this is only from what I've experienced living on dilantin.,"I've been on dilantin for a little over 16 years and counting. Its helped me with my seizures at night. I have ones where they only happen at night in my sleep. I'm athletic and eat fairly well (semi vegetarian Is suppose lol) and in need for change. I'm done with doctors experimenting with my brain_ late in this stage I just can't handle these side effects_ it ruins a large aspect of my social life and I feel stupid around others when I'm not engaging quick enough in conversation.

This subsided soon.,I have taken Dilantin since 1965. I have been taking this once a day 3 100mg tablets before bed. I have had no side effects and my life was as normal as if I never had epilipse until June 2006 when I had a seizure. My doctor increased the dosage to 4 100mg tables _  2 taken at 11 am and 2 at 11 pm. I thought that was it for another 40 years until Thanksgiving 2009 when I had 2 seizures within 8 hours. My doctor added 2 500mg Keppra to the Dilantin. Then in Sept. 2010 _ I had a mini mal seizure where I was out for maybe a minute. What is happenning to me. Is it just because I'm getting older or because I have been taking the medication for so long ?

48, 4, Grand mal seizures,Delayed reaction times in thought. Some slurred speech -- maybe happens 2-3 times a month that I notice speech is slurred or that I can't think of the right word.,DILANTIN has worked pretty well in keeping grand mal seizures relatively well controlled (about 8-9 seizures in 10 years)_ with all of those seizures coming when the therapeutic level was low.  In fact_ the dosage may have been increased during times when compliance was the issue rather than a breakthrough seizure_ but it was hard to tell.Although the slurred speech is definitely a post-DILANTIN symptom it is really hard to tell with some of the memory/ delayed reaction issues. I definitely had some of those symptoms before diagnosis and also had insomnia issues as well. Was also diagnosed with sleep apnea_ and with the wide range of problems that sleep apnea can cause it is hard to really pin down any of those symptoms on DILANTIN or epilepsy. The sleep apnea existed before the epilepsy and it's possible they're even related. I will go through periods of drunk-like and there are times I can be at work and close my eyes for a second and suddenly be in REM sleep_ but it is still hard to tell anything if you're not getting sleep.I have had not had gum growth or recession. Overall_ it's worked pretty well and unless I addressed the other issues of insomnia/ sleep apnea it's pretty hard to justify switching when I haven't had a seizure in 2 years.,M,44,10  years460 mg 1X D,7/19/2010Email,Dilantin

On 400mg_ I feel the above side effects which affect my livelihood and social interaction.  On the dose I take_ only once in a blue moon do I feel a slightly off balanced.  I do know to take extra care of my gums and will take a bone density test when I turn 40.  I love daily products so I don't anticipate this being a problem.,My only additional comment relates to the one time in 18 years where I ran out of the medication.

Then saw an infomercial for a sub-lingual Vitamin B pill. It was pitched by a doctor we once knew in another town. Liked him. Trusted him. No mention of post-seizure_ or Dilantin_ but he claimed the stuff would help with the symptoms i was  experiencing. What the hell. We ordered some with limited expectation. About 6 weeks later we realized my condition had changed very noticeably. A couple months later I went through an exhaustive [3 hour] eval and road test to determine if I actually was ready to drive again. Bingo!Not 100%_ but I'm 73 and few in my group are. In the last year I've done all the driving on trips of 2500 miles_ and several of almost 800 miles. No sweat.Every case is different but it's worth  a try for anyone who's in comparable straights. Just be patient though. It takes a few weeks.It may not be easy to find_ but anyone on Dilantin_ considering another anti-seizure drug_ or worried about long-term use must read the Jack Dreyfuss  [the mutual fund pioneer] book: ""A Remarkable Medicine Has Been Overlooked"".

56, 5, Life-extension purposes.,No adverse side-effects whatsoever.,I have taken this drug at 100 mgs daily for long spells but today take it occasionally especially if I am about to face some apprehensive social situation. It helps at maintaining one's composure. It also inceases one's stamina enabling one to do manual tasks without exhaustion. On intially taking it (the first 3 doses) I experineced a psychological high but thereafter no noticeable effect. My wife too takes it when feeing apprehensive or depressed but requires 200 mgs for her to notice its benefit. We self-medicate.,M,79,16  years,12/30/2009Email,Dilantin

Dilantin may be an oldie_ but for me it has been a goodie at 300 mg/day alternating with 400 mg/day.  I have climbed mountains_ run a half-marathon_ and not been cognitively affected at all. I am now working on my PhD in the top program in my field. Gums fine_ bone density fine (with vitamin supplements and weight bearing exercise).

It burns.Cold water used in conjunction with taking Dilantin has stopped an oncoming seizure before happening. A Cold towel around the neck-(loosely)_ and cold towel under the arm pits.Having a fan helps too. (oxygen)(Note): Age & condition are to be taken into account.Dilantin has saved my butt for 26 yrs.

Lack of concentration and coordination problems are two things I would like to attribute to dilantin. Maybe a slower thought process.,I take half of what was prescribed to me (200 mg opposed to  400 mg) to reduce side effects and it's been an effective dossage. For the most part it's been a miracle drug but have alway been concerned about potential ill effects.

66, 5, Seizure Control,Slight drowsiness_ bad constipation_ & intermittent (last for a few minutes every few days) uneasy dizzy feeling.  Mostly these side effects were only during the first few months of taking this medication then subsided or learned how to control.,Excellent medication that I am very grateful for as it has eliminated seizures for over 20 years.  Very few side effects and this medication controls seizures for me even though my blood levels show that I am below the therapeutic level.  I take 400mg of Phenytek (time released Dilantin) and my body must metabolize most of it as my blood levels are below theraputic....but it is still very effective and controls my seizures.  No need for me to increase level and every time I had lowered my dose I have had a seizure.  Early on I had some uneasy dizzy spells where it kind of felt like the earth was moving and I would get very anxious (sweaty palms_ increase heart beat) but it wouldn't last very long.  It was not so bad that it would affect my driving_ walking_ function or anything_ just an uneasy feeling as I thought maybe it was a sign that I was going to have a seizure.  Once I realized this feeling was from the medication and not a forewarning of a seizure then it didn't bother me.  Mo,M,42,22  years,2/21/2009,Dilantin

The fact that I suffer from Sleep Apnea seems to amplify the drowsiness to the point that I often find it nearly impossible to watch a TV program or movie in the evening without falling asleep.  Once I have passed out cold on the couch (around 8:00 p.m.)_ my wife finds it nearly impossible to wake me and I often feel that coming out of sleep is very hard as if Im drunk_ as one writer states below.  Once I finally wake up (around 11:00 p.m.)_ I find myself wide awake soon afterwards and unable to sleep again until the wee hours of the morning.  This frustrates my wife to no end,I have read all of the comments on this page and I understand_ to some degree_ how difficult many of your experiences have been.  I am grateful to have a fairly normal_ seizure free life and realize that things could be much worse than having to deal with the side-effects of Dilantin.  Nonetheless_ I know that it can be challenging and I try to take comfort in the hope that someday soon progress will be made towards understanding_ preventing and perhaps even curing seizure disorders currently regarded as idiopathic.

No big deal when I was originally a write off but things have gone amazingly well anyway.,I'm 27 and don't have any kids.  I guess Dilantin is one of the best seizure medications to be on if you are pregnant_ so I'll stay on it.  Very few side effects on unborn babies.

I've been taking 300 mg daily for 34 years. I had severe gum problems requiring sugery almost quarterly_ which stopped completely after the first 10 years. I've had a slow developing neuropathy in my feet_ and I know that Dilantin contributed to my osteoperosis (hip fracture 6 years ago). I was on Fosamax for 6 years with good results until recently. I was switched to Boniva with terrible side effecdts. My problem now is the possibility of coming off Dilantin to one of the newer drugs to better control the progress of the osteoperosis. Dilantin has been a great ""work horse"" drug for me despite the side effects. If changing causes me to lapse into a seizue_ I may no longer be able to drive - or worse.",Younger women should clearly be aware of the need for conscientious dental health to control gum disease_ as well as the risk for osteoperosis and drug-induced neuropathy with Dilantin.

103, 3," ""Focus"" for seizures in brain",After taking Dilantin now for my fourth week_ I feel safe in regards to my seizure prevention_ yet have many concerns towards my Dilantin medication.  Since being on the medication - 400mg at bed time - I have experienced extreme mood swings including frustration_ impatience and anti-social feelings towards my friends and family_ even towards my girlfriend.  I also find myself at times very dizzy for a minute or two at a time to the point where I feel I have to sit down in order to continue walking or even standing.  I have also felt a major loss of appetite complete with almost daily headaches.  My final symptom since beginning Dilantin is a very ugly rash beginning on my feet and hands and spreading upwards towards my legs and arms.  The rash is similar to a Measles rash - and I have had my shots for that - with tiny red spots not very raised that itch on occasion_ complete with shakiness and tingling of these extremities.,Has anyone else near my age with a seizure issue had the same sort of side effects to Dilantin or possibly have any advice?

131, 1, epileptic seizures,I had my first seizure when I was 14 years old.  I was perscribed 30mg phenobarbital. My second Gran mal seizure_ they added 100mg of dilantin.  From there on_ each time I had a seizure_ my neurologist would just increase the dosage until my body would adjust to the level and surpass it.  I would then have another gran mal seizure.  Finally I was taking 150mg of phenobarbital_ 500mg of dilantin_ and 1250mg of depakote daily. The dilantin was making me very drowsy_ swelling of the gums_ irritability.  During school years_ many teachers would pull me aside and tell me I better not show up on campus stoned again or I will be suspended.  The only side effect that was ever explained to me was after I was on the medications for 9 years and that was the dilantin and phenobarbital together rob your body of its calcium and vitamin D.

The reason behind this move was to record a seizure on computer and localize exactly what part of the brain is causing the seizures.

Now we are back to russian roulet with the medications.  The most current are Topamax and Lamictal.  The neurologists speak very highly of these.

Dilantin was a great started drug for me when I was diagnosed and the severity of my epliepsy was unknown but I recomend changing to a long-term drug as soon as you can -- you don't have to live with the side effects!,F,24,6  years,2/21/2006,Dilantin
139, 5, siezures (neurocardiogenic syncope),I usually have to keep my level on the high side of the theraputic range (about 20-22) so when it goes too high I usually get memory problems and Coordination problems.  It's hard to tell if I am getting hair growth because I am italian.  But the coordination has definetly been a big issue_ which I noticed quite a bit out on a boat.  The memory problems have hindered me a little bit_ since I am in grad school but I've learned that if you really wotk on it_ it is possible to train your memory better in spite of the medication.  Problem with side effects is unless it's obvious_ you get the med student sydrome and feel you have each thing you see on the list.,My problems may be casued more to a problem in the cardiovascular system_ However_ since I changed from tegretol to phenytoin I have only had siezures due to the change in medication.  It really has been a great medication and allowed me to stop worrying about when my next seizure is going to be.,M,28,2  years,2/1/2006Email,Dilantin
140, 5, 2-3 Seizures,I can relate to many of you. I have been on Dilantin for nearly a year now and I thank the gods it has set me straight. For the past 7 years of my life I suffered from significant sleep issues. After about 6_ combined with high levels of stress_ burning the candle from 2 ends_ and one time a nasty flu_ I had a few seizures over the course of 3 months. 2 were with one day due to that fact that I hurt my back during seizure #1 and could not sleep following the episode. I have been seizure free since I started taking dilantin. I definitely have side affects that seem to  line up with many of you. Some I am sure are just due to that fact that all the years of abuse have affected me neurologically. The effects that bother me are poor concentration_ memory issues_ an occasional frustrating search for a word_ and perhaps that is it.  All in all_ I can say reduced stress lessens these side effects and they have gotten marginally better over time. The first 4-6 months where difficult. I truly f,,M,29,1  years,1/22/2006,Dilantin

142, 5, complex-partial seizures,Initial unsteadiness on feet and appetite suppression.,I found it very important to take a vitamin B complex supplement to control the fatigue and depression that long-term use caused. Even after a temporal lobectomy Dilantin is the only drug that controls seizures and has bearable side-effects.,F,47,15  years,1/6/2006,Dilantin
143, 4, Epilepsy - tonic-clonic (Grand Mal),"Not sure if these are side effect_ since when I mentioned them to the last neurologist I saw_ she essntially discounted them. But for the past 5-10 years I have difficulty ""finding"" words_ or use the wong words for things. I also have problems with long-term memory. Whole events are gone. Like my visit Blackpool when I was 16 - I only know I've been there because I have seen photos and/or my husband tells me about it. Even when told about it_ nothing comes back.Facial hair - not sure if this is the same type of growth other people are experiencing - mine isn't all over my face_ but like ""whiskers."" Waxing/plucking looks after it_ but it's not very attractive in a woman. Wonder if changing drugs will reduce this.Mentioned to my GP that I'd been getting something like ""hot flashes"" and he did say that chemical changes in my body if I am peri-menopausal could definitely affect Dilantin levels/effectiveness.",Developed epilepsy at the age of 7. Early on was on Phenobarb and Dilantin_ later switched to Dilantin alone. At about 15yo tried Depokene(?) Depakote(?) (can't remember which) but it was decided Dilantin was best. Dilantin has controlled my seizures for over thirty years_ but I find that in the past few years it isn't as effective as it once was. I get tremors and focal seizures more_ and have come close many times to having tonic-clonic seizures (most times going to sleep for a while helps.)At this point_ my Dilantin levels are high - according to my GP_ creeping into the range where liver toxicity becomes a worry - my liver function has been checked and so far it's ok. Currently I'm waiting on a consult with a neurologist to look at possibly changing to something else.Would love to hear from others who may have experienced decreased effectiveness as menopause approached. Did you change drugs? To what? And would also like to know if anyone else has had long-term memory prob,F,38,32  years,10/8/2005Email,Dilantin
144, 4, Epilepsy,Beginning of gum overgrowth. Dentist tells me to floss and massage gums every time I brush. If gums get too big_ they will go in and cut some of the gum back. I have a memory problem. Nothing bad though. I played Jesus in a play and had no troubles memorizing over 500 lines.,I take 600mg all at night right before bed (Started out with 300mg when first diagnosed 18yrs ago). My seizures are controlled with Dilantin. I am able to drive_ go cycling_ camping_ fishing_ and several other outdoor activities. I was in Martial Arts and was a gymanst in High School (2nd in State). My GPA was a 3.8 at Texas State Technical College and a 4.0 GPA at Western Technical Institute. I am in the process of hopefully becoming a City Carrier for the Post Office. I have passed all tests and just waiting to see my doctor_ so he can fill out some forms for me. Benefits with the Post Office are great!,M,33,18  years,8/9/2005Email,Dilantin
145, 4, benign brain tumor_ removed 1995,if the level gets too high- vertigo_ blurred vision_ drowsiness_ imbalance.  Otherwise_ no noticible effects,This medication required diligent monitoring.  If the level in the blood changes too quickly_ you can experience many side effects.  I was fine for several years at 3x100mg/day.  Several years ago_ I started a diet to help me gain weight_ and threw my level off_ resulting in a seizure.  Recently I've been sick and lost a lot of weight_ throwing off my level.  Readjusting requires frequent blood tests.,M,31,11  years,8/5/2005,Dilantin
146, 4, gran mal epilepsy,I have begun to experience peripheral neuropathy_ and combined with menopause_ memory problems. Lipitor use brought on a seizure and so did use of generic medication.,This medication has been good to me_controlling my seizures_ but I wish the discussion of the side effects and what to watch for was done up front by the drs.  The gp. does not know what to look for as a side effect and the neurologist sees me extremely infrequently.,F,56,40  years,7/30/2005Email,Dilantin
147, 3, due to having cerebral palsy.,i have been taking 500mg of dilantin every day for over ten years... experienced most side effects... so far the worst effect has been the extreme gum/teeth damage.  i was warned about gum problems... but not at this extent... very painful mosta the time. i myself am researching different meds... does help w/seizures... not sure if the pain of effects r worth it though.,,F,29,10  years,7/27/2005,Dilantin
148, 2, Diabetes,Loss of Memory_ Forgetfullness_ Tired all the time_ stomach pains_and pimples.,I had to start taking Dilantin because I would have seizure when my blood sugar would be too low.  The doctor said the medicine might help with them.  I guess as an extra precaution but I don't think its good and I don't like the medicine.,F,23,1  months,7/19/2005,Dilantin

150, 4, seizure disorder,My hygentist noticed some affect to my gums from this med_ I also believe it causes me to feel tired and some memory issues. My being tired is a contributing factor toward having mild anxiety attacks. I also notice darker hair growth incl onmy hands and under fore-arms around the wrist_ and face. As of late I have also felt a skin crawling which I guess is a result of the hair growth. Otherwise this med controls my grandmal seizures,My Dr. plans to switch me from it in case I decide to get pregnant in the future. I carried one baby successfully to term with no ill-effects to the fetus. But they were esp watchful of heart and spine disorders to the fetus. She was delivered healthy and strong. We were happy to see she did not have any finger_ toe or facial structure problems such as cleft lip or palate which has also been associated with babies born to mothers on Dilantin.,F,31,3  years,7/15/2005,Dilantin
151, 4, Epilepsy,Decreased brain activity_ tiredness/lethargy_ lower levels of some vitamins(D and possibly B complex). Folic Acid supplement is a MUST for all users of Dilantin. Talk to your doctor for info.,It does keep me seizure free provided I have a normal sleep pattern of 8 hours a day. Without the sleep it is much less effective if not ineffective. I don't like what it did to me mentally. I have no choice. IMPORTANT TAKE SUPPLEMENTAL VITAMINS. Vitamin D is important in formation of bones and teeth. Dilantin lowers this vitamin level as a known side effect. Vitamin B-complex uptake I believe may also be affected. Vitamin B6 also helps in proper function of the neurons or nerves. B-12 loss affects short term memory. Vitamin B-12 deficiency symptoms include: loss of appetite_ numbness and tingling of hands and feet_ paleness_ shortness of breath_ fatigue_ weakness_ confusion or change in mental status in severe or advanced cases. These symptoms echo the side effects of Dilantin. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist first. The generic version of Dilantin did not work with me.,M,41,14  years,6/25/2005,Dilantin
152, 3, seizures from mild tbi,The dilantin has the least side effects but I sleep at least 8 hours at night and then a 2-3 hour nap half way into the day. I am finding this drug sedative.,The dilantin only covers my partial and tonic-clonic seizures. This medication is not covering my absence_ myoclonic and atonic seizures. Of all the seizure medications I have tried I do like dilantin the best for not haveing any effect on a personality change.,F,48,3  days,5/20/2005,Dilantin
153, 4, Grand mal & petit mal seizures-,Immune system_ memory_ gums have receded from teeth.  However Dilantin can control the seizure as long as my Dilantin level is at a proper level.  I have tried several anti-convulsant medications.  I have experienced fewer side effects with Dilantin.,Along with taking the daily dosages of Dilantin_ I have done research and try to take responsibility for my daily activities.  I know what triggers my seizures and attempt to avoid them.  I experienced a grand mal four weeks ago_ just days after back surgery.  It turns out that my Dilantin level was a four.  It is a shame that I can not keep track of my levels other than going to a lab to have blood drawn.  As with people with diabetes checking their surgar levels it would be great if people plagued with seizures had a method of making sure that their anti-convulsant medication was at a safe level.,F,53,30  years,4/15/2005Email,Dilantin

In general_ I sleep OK now and feel normal.,I'm taking it because of a nighttime seizure I had.  I have been diagnosed with a cavernous angioma (a birth defect in my brain_ some veins leak a little blood and cause irritation) The docs tell me that this caused my seizure.  I've known about it for 8 years_ but opted not to take any medicine_ because the only symptom was a face twitch_ that was just a nuisance.  I took Dilantin a few years ago_ and thought the medicine effects were worse than the face twitch_ so told my doctor that I wouldn't take it anymore.  Now I have to take it because my driver's license has been suspended_ and I need to get it reinstated.  Am considering surgery to fix the problem_ and then_ I am told_ I won't have to take medicine any more after a couple of years.,M,45,28  days,2/5/2005Email,Dilantin

After being on this medication for this long and also being in menopause_ I have had to start taking Fosamax to help my bone density.  After 2 years_ my bone density is back to normal but I continue to take the Fosamax.  Another side effect is some facial hair but with todays hair removers_ this is not worth worrying about.  My coordination is not perfect because of the medicine but I have learned to live with it.
