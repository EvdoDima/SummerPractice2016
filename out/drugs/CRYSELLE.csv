0, 1, contraceptive,fatigue_ dizziness_ cystic breakouts_ extreme mood swings_ heavy period_ cramping_ migraines,I was giving this pill a three month trial. I have always been a healthy_ laid back person_ but on this pill I was on edge and sick. At the worst stage of taking the medicine_ I was wanting to live in a cave because my migraines and mood swings had become so bad. I longed for complete silence_ darkness_ and no smells. I went to the doctor for vertigo then ended up in the ER with chest pains and a panic attack because I thought I had a blood clot. Thankfully the scans for blood clots came back clear. I was also fearful I had a brain tumor or something terribly wrong because my headaches were the worst of my life and daily. My MRI stated I needed to see a neurologist and will finally get my appointment in May. I was put on a hypothyroid pill because my TSH tested too high. Since stopping the Cryselle and beginning Levothyroxine_ my symptoms have all gone away! It could be that I had an underlying condition of underactive thyroid_ but I did NOT have any known health issues until taking this drug. And I had been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for the past five years. I go back to have my TSH level retest this week. It will be interesting to see if it was simply the Cryselle that rocked my world or if it is a condition Cryselle helped me identify. I am keeping my neurologist appointment_ but I have not had any migraines or vision issues in three weeks now that my system and hormones seem to be leveled back out.,F,27,3  months 1X D,4/10/2016,Cryselle
1, 1, Endometriosis,I got on this pill right after surgery for my endo. From day one this pill has been a problem. It started off with extreme nausea_ dizziness and disorientation. My doc said this was completely normal but to try to take the pill at night instead of am. Into my second pack I started at 7pm instead of 7am - the nausea was still there and I started bleeding irregularly. I would have two periods for the next three months. Absolutely HORRIFIC cramping all the time even when I'm not on my period and not to mention I feel like I belong in an insane asylum. I am so ANGRY all the time to the point where I envision hurting someone. I have zero drive to do anything. I have gained 15lbs and I have horrible cystic acne especially on my jaw line and chin and T-zone which I've never had before. I seriously feel like this pill is just not worth it. I definitely would NOT recommend. Will NOT be going back on it after this pack.,,F,27,4  months30mg,1/31/2016,Cryselle

3, 2, irregular periods/cramps/emotions,It's still all new to me. But I feel like I have super bad cramps almost immediately. But I thought maybe it was just me. I always get sick when I have cramps so i didn't necessarily blame the pill. Asked my DR and she didn't think that this pill is giving me such terrible cramps all month. My face is oily and I can't stop thinking about jamming my face with meat. I am going to see my OBGYN to see about my abnormal Pap and hopefully get off this. Or maybe the worst int over. ???idk,,F,31,3  weeks.3mg,1/27/2016,Cryselle

6, 1, regulate period_ fibroids,It started out with nausea and bloating - didn't feel well but was told by doctor to give some time in system so I did.  After only 3 weeks of taking pills I thought I have a Charley horse in leg.  About 2 days later my leg swelled and I went to the emergency room and found out I had blod clots in leg and in lungs - multiple ones.  The doctor said I was lucky to have made it to the hospital.  I spent 5 days in hospital_ now have to be put on blood thinner for 6 months(perscription - $416mth. and I have to have a hysterectomy in 6mths. after I am done with Blood thinners.,"WATCH OUT- my life has completely changed!  I now have to ask for help for everything because I can hardly walk.  I am hopeful in a couple weeks/ months things will hopefully become better.  It is hard not to be able to do your daily activities and my life has been put on hold.  I also will be off of work with no income until I can walk again!  My only ""high risk"" was that I was 46 years of age.  BEWARE- ASK Questions",F,46,3  weeks.3 1X D,11/20/2015Email,Cryselle

16, 1, Birth Control,Before Cryselle I was very fit and in good shape. I also had perfect skin. I never had cramps_ migraines_ spotting or heavy periods. I was energetic and always happy. After being on Cryselle for over a year_ I have gained over 30 pounds. I anticipated weight gain since that's a major side effect of most birth controls_ so I changed my eating habits shortly after starting Cryselle. I started eating healthier and being more active but that didn't help with the rapid weight gain. I now have stretch marks all over my body.  I also have terrible acne all over my face_ back_ and chest. I have migraines 24/7 and they get worse when I'm on my period. The first period I had after starting Cryselle_ I had the most excruciating cramps I've ever experienced. I thought my body was just getting used to the pills so I shook it off. I still get extremely terrible and debilitating cramps to this day. Over the counter pills_ especially made for Menstrual cramps_ do absolutely nothing to ease the pain.,If you are taking these pills or plan on starting these pills_ pay close attention to your health and behavior. If you notice any bad changes_ please consult your doctor. Don't let Cryselle ruin your life like it has done for me.,F,20,1.5  years.3mg/.03 1X D,10/4/2014,Cryselle

19, 1, Birth control,"Worst decision I ever made. This was my first birth control so I thought it was ""normal"" to feel how I felt. I was incredibly incredibly emotional and moody. I would cry at the drop of a hat. I would get angry at any and everything. I felt so depressed. My period was also always heavy and would come with painful cramps. I finally realized this wasn't normal and decided to try a new pill. My doctor prescribed me a new one and I felt totally different and back to myself almost immediately!!!!

23, 1, Cycle regulation,Did a good job regulating cycles - HOWEVER has been the main contributing factor in conjunction with Factor V Leiden clotting inheritance linked to the stroke I encountered in April 2011.,"Previously stayed away from medications in general and never had blood test prior to beginning consumption - was given the thumbs up to low side effects and was instructed that the low amount of hormone was ""ok"".  Would NEVER have even started using if I would have known it was a possible complication.

24, 1, birth control,constant headaches_ extremely bad moodiness_ fatigue_ leg numbness and pain,I had a terrible headache for the entire first week  of this pill. Nothing helped it go away. It also made me turn into a MONSTER. Everything made me angry. I couldn't believe how little control I had over my emotions. It also makes me extremely tired. The clincher is my leg numbness. It felt (and still feels) like I have tourniquets on my thighs. My legs throb and hurt. I still get headaches. I will not be renewing this prescription for the second cycle.,F,22,2  weeks 1X D,6/21/2011Email,Cryselle
25, 1, Shrink ovarian cyst/BC,I had EXTREME moodiness. I thought my husband was going to call off the wedding! Also_ my libido decreased to a big fat ZERO. I have been off of it for four months now and the moodiness is gone_ but the libido is still non-existent_ which has never been the case for me. I'm a newlywed_ so this is has been extremely frustrating. I will never take a birth control pill ever.,On the positive side_ my doctor put me on this particular type because we were trying to shrink an ovarian cyst. The other lower dose pills were not working_ and this one finally did the trick. But if I had known I would have these side effects_ I would rather have had surgery_ without a doubt.,F,36,5  months0.3-30mg 1X D,11/3/2010Email,Cryselle
