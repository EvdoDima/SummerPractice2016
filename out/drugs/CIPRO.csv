0, 1, prostatitis,Heart palpitations_ severe anxiety_ severe insomnia.,As a result of my insomnia - which kept me up for 48 hours at a time - and anxiety I got addicted to benzodiazapines - another dangerous class of drugs that are over-prescribed - which was most unpleasant to fix.  I also think it damaged my immune system as I simultaneously developed psoriatic arthritis along with the stated symptoms.Flouroquinalones are well-documented to cause all sorts of very bad side effects_ some permanently disabling. There are support groups and at least one documentary that document such. A number of drugs in this class have been banned in Europe because of the side effect profile.  They should never be used as a first-resort antibiotic but they often are.It took me two years of hell to recover from my side effects and I still don't sleep like I used to and find it hard to get motivated sometimes. Don't take any drug in this class unless your life depends on it.  Really.,M,66,30  days500 mg 2X D,8/16/2016,Cipro

4, 1, UTI/Bladder infection,Took in 9/2014 for 7 days. 2 YEARS LATER - SUFFERING PERMANENT_ DISABLING SIDE EFFECTS. While on Cipro - random ice pick pain in both hips_ both knees_ and shoulder. Terrible lower back pain. Pain all over body. After finishing med - felt like razor blades were slicing both achilles tendons. 8 weeks later - walked up and down stairs/next day could not walk. Both achilles tendons and calf muscles were frozen/taken in wheelchair to orthopaedic doctor. 6 weeks of PT ? can now walk_ but can never dance_ run_ exercise_ or stand on toes again due to permanent tendon damage. Recently had MRI - diagnosed with tendon damage and bursitis (painful inflammation) in both hips. Hips always painful. Have to lift myself off of car seat with both arms when I drive over speed bumps. Can't do any repetitive movements with my hips. Use heating pad on them and lay down a lot. Hurts to walk for too long in store. Cipro also damaged thyroid - caused hypothyroidism. Nails broke off in chunks after Cipro,"RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN FROM THIS POISON (while you can still run) I IMPLORE YOU - DO NOT EVER TAKE THIS DRUG - IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE. (THIS INCLUDES LEVAQUIN AND AVELOX_TOO)  I have done a lot of research these past 2 painful years. Cipro was originally created for anthrax exposure only.  It also has been used as a chemo drug_ and it acts like a CHEMO drug. It is NOT an antibiotic. It works by damaging bacteria DNA_ so they cannot replicate_ but it also PERMANENTLY damages human DNA. Hundreds of thousands of people have been injured by this drug. Many are permanently bedridden - in chronic pain_ crippled_ cannot walk. There have been hundreds of thousands of complaints filed with the FDA. There are at least 4 Black Box warnings on this drug_ which is the closest thing it can get to being pulled from the market. Warning #1: Tendon damage/rupture Warning #2: Permanent nerve damage Warning #3: Permanent Mitochondria Damage Warning #4: (Posted 7/26/16) As per FDA_ ""Can cause disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons_ muscles_ joints_ nerves_ and central nervous system that can occur together in the same patient."" IF YOU VALUE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE - YOU WILL NOT TAKE THESE MEDICINES AND ASK FOR ANOTHER_ SAFER ANTIBIOTIC. CONSIDER THIS REVIEW AS GOD WARNING & PROTECTING YOU.  Look up ""Cipro is Poison"" website to learn more. This website is about a healthy 30 year old guy who took 12 pills and has been bed-ridden for past 6 years.",F,43,7  days500 MG 2X D,7/31/2016Email,Cipro

The conspiracy complaint also alleges that over 5_000 people died as a result of Hamburg's conspiracy cover-up at the FDA:Once confirmed as FDA Commissioner_ Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg acted as the instrumentality that all Defendants used to perpetrate their conspiracy and racketeering enterprise by having her act illegally and outside the scope of her authority as FDA Commissioner to suppress material information to Plaintiffs and the public that Levaquin was inherently dangerous and in fact_ deadly. Had this information been disclosed to Plaintiffs and the public at large_ her and her husband's financial gain and net worth would have plummeted_ since Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg's husband_ Peter F.

17, 1, UTI,On 2nd dose felt some neuropathy in lower legs but was busy so shook it off. Thought it was from another reason. 3rd dose 1/2 hr after taking while driving felt a wave of terror come over me. Had to make it through a traffic light while asking my kids in the back seat to pray for me. Thank The Lord I was picking up an older daughter who could drive. Thought it was just a wierd occurrence but decided to goggle and found this was not unusual to have this reaction. Thought I could use mind over matter_ proceeded to go on a 6 lane rd only to have it strike again. I lumped out of the car and told my daughter to drive. I huddled in the passenger seat_ younger daughter called an ambulance which my daughter cancelled bc there was an urgent care center around the corner. I had these episodes about every 15-20min apart. They hooked me up on a heart monitor and while lying down watched my heart rate spike to over 150. They wanted to give me Xanax or some other drug and I refused. That was all I needed_ to have another drug reacting to this one. This was terrifying_ humiliating and potentially deadly. I was headed to go out on the highway. What if this happened there? What if I didn't have the ER there? When I was released_ noticed as I would try to rest_ the drop off where your body goes to relax into sleep was a trigger to a less intense attack. So the drug cos win all around_ antibiotic_ anti anxiety meds and now sleep meds. I'm not taking anything.

Now hands are asleep while sleeping indicating peripheral neuropathy,Just Google Flagyl and Cipro lawsuits. There are firms dedicated to nothing but filing suit for people whose lives have been destroyed because of these drugs. I only took 7 pills of this poison and 7 pills of Flagyl before stopping. I believe both drugs in concert have caused the severe side affects to double. No way of knowing which one is worse. I've read that both are equally as horrible on their own. Side affects are still present after 3 days of being off. It is bar none the worst most insidious chemical I have ever put into my body.
