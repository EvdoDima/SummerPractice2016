0, 1, prostatitis,Heart palpitations_ severe anxiety_ severe insomnia.,As a result of my insomnia - which kept me up for 48 hours at a time - and anxiety I got addicted to benzodiazapines - another dangerous class of drugs that are over-prescribed - which was most unpleasant to fix.  I also think it damaged my immune system as I simultaneously developed psoriatic arthritis along with the stated symptoms.Flouroquinalones are well-documented to cause all sorts of very bad side effects_ some permanently disabling. There are support groups and at least one documentary that document such. A number of drugs in this class have been banned in Europe because of the side effect profile.  They should never be used as a first-resort antibiotic but they often are.It took me two years of hell to recover from my side effects and I still don't sleep like I used to and find it hard to get motivated sometimes. Don't take any drug in this class unless your life depends on it.  Really.,M,66,30  days500 mg 2X D,8/16/2016,Cipro

4, 1, UTI/Bladder infection,Took in 9/2014 for 7 days. 2 YEARS LATER - SUFFERING PERMANENT_ DISABLING SIDE EFFECTS. While on Cipro - random ice pick pain in both hips_ both knees_ and shoulder. Terrible lower back pain. Pain all over body. After finishing med - felt like razor blades were slicing both achilles tendons. 8 weeks later - walked up and down stairs/next day could not walk. Both achilles tendons and calf muscles were frozen/taken in wheelchair to orthopaedic doctor. 6 weeks of PT  can now walk_ but can never dance_ run_ exercise_ or stand on toes again due to permanent tendon damage. Recently had MRI - diagnosed with tendon damage and bursitis (painful inflammation) in both hips. Hips always painful. Have to lift myself off of car seat with both arms when I drive over speed bumps. Can't do any repetitive movements with my hips. Use heating pad on them and lay down a lot. Hurts to walk for too long in store. Cipro also damaged thyroid - caused hypothyroidism. Nails broke off in chunks after Cipro,"RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN FROM THIS POISON (while you can still run) I IMPLORE YOU - DO NOT EVER TAKE THIS DRUG - IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE. (THIS INCLUDES LEVAQUIN AND AVELOX_TOO)  I have done a lot of research these past 2 painful years. Cipro was originally created for anthrax exposure only.  It also has been used as a chemo drug_ and it acts like a CHEMO drug. It is NOT an antibiotic. It works by damaging bacteria DNA_ so they cannot replicate_ but it also PERMANENTLY damages human DNA. Hundreds of thousands of people have been injured by this drug. Many are permanently bedridden - in chronic pain_ crippled_ cannot walk. There have been hundreds of thousands of complaints filed with the FDA. There are at least 4 Black Box warnings on this drug_ which is the closest thing it can get to being pulled from the market. Warning #1: Tendon damage/rupture Warning #2: Permanent nerve damage Warning #3: Permanent Mitochondria Damage Warning #4: (Posted 7/26/16) As per FDA_ ""Can cause disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons_ muscles_ joints_ nerves_ and central nervous system that can occur together in the same patient."" IF YOU VALUE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE - YOU WILL NOT TAKE THESE MEDICINES AND ASK FOR ANOTHER_ SAFER ANTIBIOTIC. CONSIDER THIS REVIEW AS GOD WARNING & PROTECTING YOU.  Look up ""Cipro is Poison"" website to learn more. This website is about a healthy 30 year old guy who took 12 pills and has been bed-ridden for past 6 years.",F,43,7  days500 MG 2X D,7/31/2016Email,Cipro

17, 1, UTI,On 2nd dose felt some neuropathy in lower legs but was busy so shook it off. Thought it was from another reason. 3rd dose 1/2 hr after taking while driving felt a wave of terror come over me. Had to make it through a traffic light while asking my kids in the back seat to pray for me. Thank The Lord I was picking up an older daughter who could drive. Thought it was just a wierd occurrence but decided to goggle and found this was not unusual to have this reaction. Thought I could use mind over matter_ proceeded to go on a 6 lane rd only to have it strike again. I lumped out of the car and told my daughter to drive. I huddled in the passenger seat_ younger daughter called an ambulance which my daughter cancelled bc there was an urgent care center around the corner. I had these episodes about every 15-20min apart. They hooked me up on a heart monitor and while lying down watched my heart rate spike to over 150. They wanted to give me Xanax or some other drug and I refused. That was all I needed_ to have another drug reacting to this one. This was terrifying_ humiliating and potentially deadly. I was headed to go out on the highway. What if this happened there? What if I didn't have the ER there? When I was released_ noticed as I would try to rest_ the drop off where your body goes to relax into sleep was a trigger to a less intense attack. So the drug cos win all around_ antibiotic_ anti anxiety meds and now sleep meds. I'm not taking anything.

There are firms dedicated to nothing but filing suit for people whose lives have been destroyed because of these drugs. I only took 7 pills of this poison and 7 pills of Flagyl before stopping. I believe both drugs in concert have caused the severe side affects to double. No way of knowing which one is worse. I've read that both are equally as horrible on their own. Side affects are still present after 3 days of being off. It is bar none the worst most insidious chemical I have ever put into my body.

Just because he's willing to play Russian roulette with his life doesn't mean you have to play it with yours. Cipro--and every other fluoroquinolone antibiotic still on the market--is capable of causing savage harm. Hello_ every drug in this class now carries MULTIPLE black box warnings.  Yea--real safe!

61, 2, Prostate infection,None. I do not understand the reviews on this website. I looked up studies on the incidence of any adverse reaction from this drug and the incidence is around one percent. Yet this drug has a rating of 1.6 out of five and most patients recommend against using this antibiotic. The studies I looked at proved it has fewer side effects than most other commonly used antibiotics. Is it possible that just the people with adverse reactions review drugs like Cipro? I noticed that all commonly dispensed antibiotics are terrible drugs according to the reviews on this site.,It was interesting to read reviews on this site. It seems that drugs that are well known to be highly toxic to the body and mind like speed (Methamphetamine and adderall) received among the best reviews. Even haloperidol_ a neurotoxic neuroleptic that causes tardive dyskinesia in 30 percent of users and parkinsonism in over 50 percent of users has better reviews than this widely prescribed antibiotic. The flouroquinolones are available over the counter in most Asian countries (for example bangladesh). If they were crippling everyone then a large proportion of Asians would be crippled. The published studies on the safety profile of this drug (showing an excellent safety profile_ better even than amoxicillin) and the reviews on this site do not match at all. Please note that I am not discrediting the side effects reported but clinical experience and these reviews do not match.,M,20,7  days500 1X D,12/30/2015Email,Cipro

74, 1, UTI,About two weeks ago_ my primart care physician diagnosed me with a UTI and prescribed cipro to be taken twice a day for 10 days. Two days later I took myself to the ER for unbelievable pain and it turns out I had a kidney stone. I am not aure if the two things are related or not. The kidney stone debacle had me on Vicodin_ Ibuprofen and Flomax so I quit the Cipro. About a week after_ I traveled to Italy and hadto go to the hospital for lower abdomen pain that I thought was my UTI coming back. The doctor prescirbed me 500 mg twice a day for six days. However I have completely given up on it_ I refuse to take it. It basically has taken all my energy away_ I have no appetite and I have a really hard time getting to sleep_ once I do get to sleep_ I wake up in the middle of the night with stomach cramps and runny stool. It is so uncomfortable. I am sure that this medicine is doing more harm than good and I will not ever take it again.,This medicine is so potent_ I dont think I should have been taking this for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection.

111, 3, Uncomplicated Lower UTI,As always with taking Cipro I start getting dizzy and heart palpitations_ anxiety_ and a mild head ache. Very thirsty all the time_ and very hungry. Some muscular-skeleton pain especially in legs. Gas,A lot of people have been commenting about cipro being taken off the market. Cipro is one of the only broad spectrum antibiotics I can take. It gives me side effects but overall it does its job_ and relatively quickly. It was approved for anthrax inhalation in 2004 I believe_ and to battle such an illness you have to be strong. These complainers obviously haven't taken the Malaria pill. There's on for you_ if you can keep it down long enough for it to worm that is. Overall a very safe drug to take because it's half life is 12 hours so it'll be out of your system quickly.,F,23,3  days500 mg,7/6/2015,Cipro

It was a bad infection (three intravenous drug treatments three emergency room admissions_ four weeks in hospital_ private infection room where everyone had to wear protective clothing Including food service. Six moths on clarithromycin. I took cipro both orally and intravenously. It was one drug of many.

I can go on and on here_  I do not over-react_ I am a level headed person_ who knows what it's like to be sick and suffer_ but the way this drug made me feel was beyond cruel. Please_ don't take cipro_ or levaquin or any drug in that family unless it's life or death! and DEMAND they keep you as an IN patient for the first 24-48 of taking CIPRO/LEVAQUIN!! I'm serious! or ask for a much milder antibiotic!! I swear if you need an antibiotic! you are already sick! don't make yourself 100times WORSE!!!! and to all the doctors_ physicians assitants_ nurse practitioners - BEFORE you give this - WARN the patient of the strength of this!! or how about you take it yourself! or give it to YOUR family/loved ones!! you all know the black box warning! listen to it!!! ugh!!!!,F,29,1  times500mg 2X D,6/25/2015Email,Cipro

I would have been homeless if not for family support.,The damage to my quality of life was so extreme I personally would die before using this drug again.  This drug is very insidious_ with damage occurring weeks and months post exposure. The medical profession is loathe to admit the drugs they commonly prescribe can do this.  Thus_ complaints after exposure are assigned another cause.  I ended up having 3 exposures before an astute clinician put the puzzle together.  It appears that a segment of the population with a mutation in the P450 channel of the liver are susceptible to problems_ whereas others may take it without incident.

Part of the problem is that many can take it with little if any side effects.

You don't have to take my word for it--just hit up Google and you'll have no problem finding the horror stories from countless people from all around the world who've had their lives ravaged by this poison masquerading as an antibiotic.  Also be aware that Cipro can turn on you at any time--just because you've taken it in the past with no noticeable adverse effects does NOT mean you'll have the same luck going forward.  It doesn't work that way.  I truly wish nothing but death & destruction for every last employee at Bayer.

That was the extent of his instruction. Prior to taking cipro I was very fit and strong. Shortly before taking I had been cross-country skiing every week and often walked 4-5 miles easily. After 4 weeks the extreme fatigue was gone_ but still become fatigued much easier and generally feel like the cipro has aged me many years. 6 weeks after taking it_ still have much hip pain after walking an easy mile. Becomes too painful to continue after 2 miles or being on my feet for an hour such as when shopping. Gait becomes wobbly due to weakness in hip. This not improved since I stopped the cipro.

But was missing work and missing life in general because all i wanted to do is sleep.,After awhile I started feeling very week in hands and feet as if i had no muscle strength.  Its been over a year and I am still sleeping more than ever_ still week_ tired_ no energy_ hands hurt a lot.  Causing me problems at work and at home as my family doesn't understand what has happened to me.  I started having panic attacks_ trying to cover up how tired i was from the rest of the world.

He diagnosed the condition by feeling my ear and taking my temp. He actually googled the condition to check out the proper antibiotic and came up with Cipro. Only asked weather I was allergic to any antibiotics. Never told me the drug was black boxed by the FDA. I had a partial kidney removal 1 year ago for cancer and have a inoperable rotator cuff tear.

I am 33 years old and typically make it to the gym 3 times a week--not happening this week as I still feel a bit weak and tired.  I am hoping to feel back to myself by next week.  One other thing to note is that I informed my doctor that I was still feeling a bit tired_ weak and still had a loss of appetite (w/loose stools) and she took a stool sample to make sure I did not get another bacterial infection FROM cipro called C Diff.

I felt totally fatigued_ nauseous and had tingling and numbness as well as the muscular and tendon pain_ in my wrist as well as around my ankles. It has been nearly 5 months since I discontinued the course and I still have terrible pain when walking or standing - my wrist constantly aches and feels like it is burning too and I can hear ligaments clicking and grinding when I use it.

THIS DRUG IS POISON!!! IT CAN HAVE LIFE CHANGING CONSEQUENCES!!!!From there it only got worse and I only took one pill.  I was bedridden because I was so weak I could not stand up or walk.

I could hardly move in bed_ because when I did_ I would get sharp shooting pains like I could feel every muscle and tendon not being able to function.

The caffeine and nicotine did not metabolize in my body due to the Cipro_ and I spent a whopping 60 hours without any sleep at all. Package instructions had no mentioning of caffeine or nicotine. Taking 0.25 mg of Clonazepam helped on the tremors and the anxiety_ and essentially enabled me to sleep_ but enforced the disorientation.  The combination of antibiotics seemed to help against the infection_ however not clear how much can be subscribed to the Cipro (the other drug used was clarithromycin).

On the fourth day I felt sick and went to my doctor.  About that time I began feeling dizzy and as though I was going to pass out.  I stopped both medicines on that day_ but the worse was yet to come.  Anxiety_ dizziness/vision problems and stomach pain have been plaqueing me for 6 weeks now.,I went to the ER because I felt anxious with an elevated pulse rate and weird pulsing feelings in my lower leg.  They looked me over_ did a blood profile and sent me on my way.  The anxiety will just come out of nowhere (how I'd guess a panic attack might be) and I'd feel like I was about to lose control.  The anxiety has lessened gradually_ but still occurs occasionally.  However_ the feeling of dizziness (like mild vertigo) comes and goes to this day.  The pit of my stomach feels sore just to mild pressure - one day better_ the next day worse.  Beyond these horrible side effects_ I can't be sure which medicine is to blame (Metronidazole has many similar complaints).

405, 1, Uti,43 year old athletic male_ soccer player since high school_ and avid weight lifter. Felt like superman. I developed UTI symptoms and decided to take a safe medication. I had taken CIPRO 8 years ago and didn't recall any side effects. This time around took the antibiotic and went to Hell. I have experienced side effects that have damaged every organ...joint pains_ stomach pains_ cartilage destruction_ neuropathic pains ( burning skin_ pin and needles_ and so forth)_ and on and on_ worst side effects were depression that made me suicidal_ anxiety that was from Hell_ severe insomnia_ eye pains_ ringing in the ears_ loss of short term memory_ brain fog_ unable to focus eyes_ and tons more. The medical community is ignorant of the syndrome that Fluoroquinolones cause. Trust me if you haven't suffered this syndrome yet_ you WILL if you continue taking it. The good news is after 7 1/2 months I have noticed some improvements. Avoid this family of antibiotics like the plague. If you haven't experienced any of its side effects_ consider being given a second_ a third_ forth chance_ but if you continue taking it especially the 500 mg and above tablets you WILL suffer. The 250 mg tablets may be below the toxic range and most people can tolerate them well_ but the 500 mg tables will get you eventually!,,M,43,4  days500 mg,8/24/2012,Cipro

I was wrong. The second reaction was worse.  Within 24 hours of stopping the drug I was improving but probably because I only took 2-3 pills.  This drug is extremely nasty and should be recommended on a life or death basis only.

466, 1, After kidney stone removal surgery,This antibiotic caused me severe abdominal pain not related to kidney_ bloating to where I looked 5 months pregnant_ gave heart palpitations_ muscle aches_ and significant digestive problems.,This was the first time I had been on CIPRO.  I had a kidney stone that wouldn't pass_ and they did surgery to remove it_ and left a stent in for five days. That alone was horrible_ but I had a stent once before and expected that I would feel better once the stent was removed.  I felt just as bad for five days after the stent was removed_ to the point where I considered going back to the ER.  I was unable to eat_ my digestive system felt like it had shut down.  Food just did not pass from my stomach for hours and hours.  I couldn't fit into any of my pants -- I looked 5 months pregnant. I also believe I was unable to process the hospital drugs and anesthesia out of my body properly_ because things were so slowed down. There was another med I was on for two days that turned my urine blue.  For nearly 72 hours after my last dose of that med I peed blue_ even though my doc said it cleared out of the system completely in 6 hours. I blamed this med for my problems_ since I had never had problem with antibiotic before_ and I quit that med.  I continued to take CIPRO for two full days more before I looked it up_ experiencing such an unwell feeling that I was minutes away from going to hospital. I also had significant heart palpitations_ by the way. I read the side effects of CIPRO and many of them were what I was experiencing.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS DRUG.  I have been off of it for two days_ and I am still not doing regular activities_ still feel ill_ though my appetite is back,F,44,10  days500 mg 2X D,4/13/2012Email,Cipro

469, 1, ,Fluoroquinolones can cause a severe reaction that hasn't been fully appreciated by the medical community. I am a physician and I know how ignorant we are with regards to the side effects. The FDA warning doesn't take a strong stand against the side effects and fails to mention that Fluoroquinolones lead to a SYNDROME with many side effects. To believe this class of medications causes one or another side effect is completely irresponsible of the FDA. As a physician and as someone that is suffering the Fluoroquinlone syndrome/toxicity_ I beg the FDA to limit the use of Fluoroquinolones to life and death situations_ and to recognize that Fluoroquinolones can lead to a syndrome that can last months if not years. If it wasn't for my vacation and sick leave days_ and the kindness and understanding of my empoyer_ I would be out of a job! Yes_ a Physician at  age 43 out of a job and on disability.  This is proposterous to say the least. The FDA must take the sufferes seriously. I have revi,Prior to this toxicity_ I was a healthy_ physically active person. I had NO medical history. For God's sake_ I had never taken any meds except a few motrins and Tylenols here and there. This medication has completely made my life miserable. I feel like a 300 year person. Please_ I beg the FDA to take a moral and ethical stand above monetary  gains_ and limit the use of these meds_ and to better inform the public of the syndrome that may arise_ and believe me_ as a sufferer_ the symptoms aren't your garden variety symptoms.

Once I finished it_ I had pain in all of my joints (mainly the ones I used). It has been two weeks and I still have a lot of pain all over. I used to be really athletic before taking this medicine. Now_ I can barely walk or lift stuff. If you take this drug_ make sure it is for a life or death situation.

I experienced extreme paint in my joints and especially my hips. I was in bed in a lot of pain for a long time. I went to the ER but they were clueless of course.  I finally got my primary care doctor to draw blood and my liver function test were elevated which is the only way it became obvious that I had gotten hepatitis from this drug. I can only imagine what the liver tests were right after I took the medicine. They were probably off the charts.

I thought he was dying. He obviously had a serious reaction to this drug.  We are terrified. Called the emergency vet_ and they sounded like they googled the drug to see what they should say to us. Awful. They have NO clue. It has been 3 and 1/ 2 hours...... Our dog is still a little confused and unbalanced _ pacing back and fourth between naps. Don't use this drug_ human or animal.

It is now Feb. 3rd_ 2012 and I am still having severe issues.  Interestingly my symptoms did not start until a couple months after taking the Cipro_ which is apparently quite common with these drugs.  I went from a very active_ athletic 29 year old to a 30 year old who can barely leave the house some days.  I am lucky to have a job that is not currently physically demanding and understanding coworkers_ or I would be in a very difficult situation.  It now requires all of my reserve of strength to make it through a normal 8 hour work day sitting at a computer_ where before I could work 10 to 12 physically demanding hours.  I have seriously thought I was on the verge of death a couple of times in the last few months_ and I probably was.  My doctors are unable to identify the cause of any of my symptoms and seem to be able to do nothing of any use to help.  Do not take this drug unless it is a last resort_ it just isn't worth it.

524, 1, Prostate issues,I took Levaquin and ciprofloxacn about 4 years ago for my prostatitis on and off for about 1 year from July-2006 to June-2007.All together I took the stuff for 122 days total. Only warning I was told about was ruptured Achilles tendon which I didn't develop so I didn't link my other problems to the drug and kept taking it because it did help my severe prostate pain.I noticed aches and pains in all my tendons muscles and after a few years has passed the pain has continued. I feel like I an old man and it takes much time to even get out of bed or up out of a chair and moving. The bottoms of my feet are so sore I can hardly walk at first. Calves down to my heals are sore. Shoulders_ and elbow tendons sore and Back of Neck and back too.Both Biceps near elbow and up as well as back of elbow. Feet from heal to toes hurt including tops of feet. Wrist fingers thumbs and back of hand bother me. Maybe I should just say I hurt all over except my face and eye lids. Forearms are also sore.,I also noticed ringing in my ears when this all started too and it never goes away. Just walking up or down steps and I get and hear threads in my knees tearing followed by pain which seems to get better in time only to happen again. Example_ all I need to do it put pressure on my elbow to turn over in bed and I hear and feel threads tearing again in my elbows and shoulders. My tendons are still brittle and have reoccurring Tendonitis from the doses I took and It was 4 years ago. I ache so bad I can't sleep nights and took so much aleve and other over the counter pain meds my stomach is upset to the point I am sitting on the toilet about 10 times a day.  I had 45 codeine pills for a sinus surgery I had in 2009 and taking one of those before bedtime at least allowed me to sleep some. Codeine is the only thing that takes the edge off the pain. I have also developed depression. I have always tried to stay active and now I don't do a lot of what I used to enjoy. I feel like I'm stuck in the body of an 80 year old man the last 4 years.

I am particularly concerned about the lingering GI distress_ which is disabling 2 days after finishing this drug. With all the research on the human genome_ scientists should be able to identify the genes that make some individuals likely to have an allergic reaction or be susceptible to drugs' adverse effects (for example_ because they metabolize them poorly).

546, 1, suspected UTI,I took this stuff twice before over 10 years ago with no issues.  I took it again 3 years ago and had alot of the same overwhelming issues other people have described.  From what i have read_ this stuff does cumulative damage that can be insidious depending on your tolerance for this drug. Those with a low tolerance are the lucky ones because they get the reactions so they stop taking it before it has the chance to do permanent damage.  For anyone reading this....look up other anitibiotics besides quinolones on this web site.....how many of them have 1300 responses_ mostly scary onces that are practically consistant person after person?  There are other safer antibiotics so even if you don't beleive anybody on here_ the bottom line is it is not necessary for you to take this stuff....you can take something else that is safer.  For me it took about a month for the intensity to start settling down and about 4 months for it to go away all together.

551, 1, Hot Tub Folliculitis,Severe GI Tract Inflammation_ Kidney Pain_ Vomiting_ Lack of Appetite_ Possible Others,Prescribed for Hot Tub Folliculitis (a skin rash caused by topical contact with contaminated hot tub water).  During treatment_ I had severe lack of appetite (not lack of hunger_ just recoil at the thought of eating no matter how hungry)_ and various symptoms that would be presumptuous to blame on the meds.  Since stopping Cipro (2 days)_ Ive had severe GI tract inflammation to the point its painful to lie on my stomach to sleep (I cant sleep on my back; no sleep either) and a dull ache/burning sensation in the kidneys similar to that I get when I drink too much soda_ but not in that it sometimes gets worse (presumably dependent on what Ive consumed).  After 1 day of self-treatment with acidophilus and magnesium_ Ive finally had a day of loose bowel movements after at least two with none and my appetite is back_ but I still cant eat much because the GI tract inflammation is still in full force and Im afraid to go back to any ignoramus that would prescribe this for a SKIN RASH!   I didnt know what it was until now_ but even my friends husband said CIPRO?  OMG_ thats for life or death treatment!   I hope and pray I dont develop the long term effects some have posted here_ but even if I dont_ what Ive already experienced is completely unacceptable results for having been treated for a skin rash!!

Every time I went to the bathroom it would be diarriah and every time I thought I was done_ it would come back.  I went to Dr. Bandri on September 26_ 2011 and he prescribed ciprofloxacin for the symptoms and ordered blood work.  The tests came back within normal range. I stopped taking the Antibiotic on Oct. 3_ 2011 due to adverse reactions including (Pains all over my body in my joints and tendons and extreme headache).  I contacted the Dr. after taking it for 4 days and told him my symptoms around 12 noon (the time that my next dosage was due) He told me to discontinue using the antibiotic.  My stool had returned to normal as well.  I stopped taking it.  Around 45 minutes after talking to the doctor_ I began to have horrific things happen to me including the list of side effects above.

I had a lot of side effects same as listed here but the 2 that I remember most include the unbelievable body pains and the 2 seizures I experienced when I took ibuprofen for the pain weeks later (after the regimen) for about a week (must have been the buildup?). Learned later: bad combination. Never had seizures before and none since. I'm not going to spend a lot of time explaining because if you're here_ you either already are or are going to become a lot more educated about this drug_ and many of these horrific side effects people are talking about are real. Here it is a year and some later_ and I still have ""aftershocks"" of pain_ very minor (and who knows_ maybe unrelated) compared to the hell of the first 6 or so months. Had MRI which confirmed tendonitis. Detoxed with chelates and more (and took expensive collagens) and eliminated a lot of fluoride sources in my diet_ all of which I believe helped significantly. This stuff sure lingers. I remember reading that Cipro in a petri dish dematrixes collagen cells within 72 hours. I remember reading that many of the anthrax letters guys back around 2002 (?) after 9-11 refused to take Cipro.

My knees hurt again and I hadn't had knee pain for 3 months before taking it.  I can't believe that as common as these seem to be that it is still commonly prescribed.

Read this article before you put your first cipro pill in your mouth: http://www.antibiotics.org/resources/side-effects.pdf,Before i started taking cipro i knew about this site and all horror stories made me worried but doc say he prescribes cipro like 5 times per day and nobody ever reports any issues so i said fck it lets take em i want to feel better i hate going to pee every few hours and went ahead and took my first pill and the only thing i noticed at first was the muscle spasm nothing else_ but my 5th day i started having some weird pain in my knees and my tendons but didn't pay much attention until day 7 went i really felt a sharp pain in my right knee_ stopped taking it immediately and side effects got worse in the upcoming days to the point that i had a limp in both legs. I stopped 08/19/11 and symptoms got worse 1 week AFTER i stopped treatment. Luckily i'm back 90% to normal i just feel there is some dmg on my right tendon but i'm crossing my fingers i don't get a rupture later on. But let me tell you that it was curing my prostatitis i was going less often to the bathroom and pain in the groin area was non existant just after taking second pill. Cipro works but side effects are serious please try something else different first and see if that works and after you try at least 2 other methods then go with cipro because if you get the not so rare side effects they can last for a while.,M,28,30  days500 2X D,9/15/2011Email,Cipro
580, 4, Blood Poisoning/Sepsis/Upper UTI,Slightly tired,I was given this in conjunction with Levaquin IV (350mg)_ because I had sepsis_ and my life was endangered. The pharmacist is who went over to avoid caffeine_ dairy 2 hours before/after doses_ and with my calcium. Monitor potassium_ etc. Drink half gallon of water per day_ and no heavy aerobics or weights_ until I'm back to normal. I was told that would take about 5 days. And then_ to baby step back in. I also have a compromised immune system_ from Fibromyalgia & IBS_ Migraines. I must take lots of supplements and dairy_ but warned to work around the doses_ as there can be issues with the Cipro if closer than 2 hours. It saved my life_ and I actually have felt better than when I first came down with fibro!

DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!,I took Cipro about a week ago for a UTI. I got the prescription from CVS (no black label warning on any of this)_ and 13 pills later I started getting pains in my legs and my arms. I called the doctor who told me to keep taking the Cipro (crazy right?).  But at that point red flags went off and my boyfriend and I went to the web and looked up CIPRO. It was then we saw millions of stories and I knew I had to stop taking this poison.A full week later and I am experiencing extreme leg spasms which have debilitated me so much that I can hardly walk and Ive been home from work the whole week. I'm in pain in my arms as well...as well as experiencing cramping and soreness in my achiilles tendons and calves are sore and cramping. I am also feeling spasms in my arms as well as my jaw. My God...what a nightmare drug.Perhaps the worse is what happened last night...On top of everything I started getting these massive PANIC ATTACKS!! and excruciating headaches. Worst I've ever had in my life. It was like someone was crushing my skull from the sides. The pain went all the way down from my head to my shoulders and trapezius muscles (Ive never had pain like it before and it was the worst headache I've ever had in my life). I've gone back to the doctor who prescibed me this poison and the doctor doesn't take me seriously and dismisses me entirely. I could spit blood I'm so angry.

Random shooting pains in my muscles. Fatigue.,If you are considering taking this pill:  DO NOT. There are much safer antibiotics out there.If you are experiencing ANY sort of stiffness_ stomachache_ or pain_ STOP TAKING THIS IMMEDIATELY.  I talked to some doctors and they said the effects tend to be longer lasting the more pills you take.I took 4 pills over two days.  On the evening after my third pill_ I had a strange bloated/nauseaus pain in my stomach. I didn't think much of it_ so I took a fourth pill that night.  During the night after the second day I was barely able to sleep and woke up several times because my limbs were numb.  In the morning_ I felt tingling and pain all over my body_  I had to consciously remember how to walk_ telling myself to pick up each foot and move it forward. It was hard to do anything with my hands_ texting_ writing_ and opening little milk cartons was almost impossible.  I really felt scared and hopeless when I read the reviews_ but started to feel a little bit better everyday.  Though I am normally quite active_ I rested and haven't exercised.  A week later_ I am feeling probably 90% better. I am still very tired and have stiffness and cracking in my joints_ but I can function almost normally (I just get tired and am still not up to being able to exercise.)I can't say much about cipro getting rid of my uti symptoms_ since I had NONE to begin with_ just some irregularities in a uranalysis.

590, 1, uti,,Dr at walk in clinic prescribed me Cipro. From the the first pill_ I noticed that my jaw started becoming tight and stiff_ and some dull pain. I thought it might have been all in my head. From the second pill_ I noticed more pain in other parts of my body_ like my feet_ legs and arms_ neck_ shoulders. I continued to take it_ especially since it was very effective against the uti_ but after the fourth pill I knew I couldn't take this anymore (and especially after reading lots of stuff online about the effects on your tendons and the long term effects that many people have for life). My legs were paining me. My feet ached. My knees hurt. My arms and hands had shooting pain. It was like someone beat me up or I had been in a car accident. I was even limping. I went to a different dr today_ and she told me this shouldn't be given for a uti_ unless several other antibiotics didn't work. She didn't seem to know anything about the tendon side effects_ and it seems no doctors or pharmacists take this seriously at all. I still have pain today_ and I am sore all over. I am worried that I will not go back to normal_ as many people haven't who took even less of the pills and dosage than me. I hope to be one of the lucky ones. This medication should not be dispensed. It should be taken off the market. I warn anyone to not ever take this medication. I am a young (28)_ healthy_ and fit woman_ and this happened to me.

Apparently_ Bayer had sent a black box warning on this poison but my doctor did not tell me about this warning.  I hear that there is a former Bayer Sales rep that is bragging that she increased sales of cipro/avelox from $800_000 to $3.5 million from 2004 to 2008. However_ there is no way this area has seen this type of increase in population/patients.  Apparently_ most of the doctors in this area are pretty corrupt (taking free stuff from Bayer) and deciding to go with the more toxic fluoroquinolones rather than staying with safe drugs such as Zithromax.,M,55,7  days500mg 2X D,8/26/2011Email,Cipro

When I was prescribed the medicine for a UTI_ I was happy it was something I was familiar with taking. Within an hour of taking my 1st dose_ I felt my throat tighten up. It felt like something was stuck in my throat. It felt dry (cotton mouth feeling). Within 2 hours my muscles/joints were aching and I had chest tightness (not sure if it is just the muscles in my chest). Went to ER and they immediately said I was having an allergic reaction to the CIPRO. They monitored me for a few hours to make sure my throat didn't close up. Was given Benadryl and another allergy medication that was a steroid (not sure the name). It helped reduce the symptoms. They continued to monitor me to make sure I was breathing ok. I was discharged after several hours since my symptoms did not worsen. The doctors were very aware of the dangerous side effects of the drug. They never questioned it was anything else. One day later_ I still feel pain in my arm and back and some tightness of my chest. The blood work at the hospital noted a decrease in my Potassium levels. Not sure if that is a side effect...but low potassium can cause muscle weakness. Do Not Take This Medicine!!!,F,37,0.5  days500 MG 2X D,8/13/2011Email,Cipro

Well_ I made the mistake of reading these reviews when I got home and considered going back to the doctor to ask for a different medication.  But by that time the clinic was closed and I was in pain from my UTI_ so I didn't really have a choice.  I'm glad I just decided to take the Cipro.  The doctor was right_ I started feeling better a few hours after my first dose and was actually feeling back to normal by the end of the 2nd day.  No side effects at all.

Have used cipro on 6-7 occasions previously with only minimal side effects (nausea_ fatigue)_ and it has always worked great_ I always keep it on hand in case of emergency -- this is how much i used to like this medication. All of this changed 10 days ago_ after I took 1 dose of 500mg (which I found out is 2x the amt I usually get_ thought the pill was kind of large when I swallowed it but was in too much pain to notice).

What the heck was the doctor thinking?  Also told them I have hashimoto's disease (hypothyroidism).  I should never have been given Cirpo_ and certainly not with ibuprophen.  Was also told to take ibuprophen for pain at home.

I also have an overall weakness after taking Ciproflaxacin.,I usually go to the gym regularly.  I was taking spin classes_ TRX classes_ Zumba_ and more.  I had trouble taking a WALK the other day.  This drug is POISON.  I was not made aware of the side effects before taking it.  I would NEVER have taken it if I was.  I figured it was like any other antibiotic.  I thought it was safe to use.  It isn't.   So now what?!  It is July 28th and I am still suffering!  How much longer is this going to affect me?  I wonder if my left ankle and foot are the worst of it_ or are there other symtoms lurking that have not come out yet?  STAY FAR AWAY from this drug!  This drug has ruined me.,F,45,2  days250mg 2X D,7/28/2011Email,Cipro
615, 1, UTI,After 2 pills_ I felt extremely dizzy_ racing heart_ and heart palpatations. I called the Dr. and she said my symptoms were probably not caused by Cipro but agreed to switch me to Bactrim. I took one pill of Bactrim and felt the same symptoms. I went to urgent care thinking I was having a heart attack.. My blood pressure and pulse were elevated. The Dr. ran an EKG_ tested heart enzymes_ and took a chest x-ray_ which all turned out to be fine. He diagnosed me with a normal sinus arrythmia and told me to continue taking Cipro and remove caffiene from my diet. After my 1st dose back on Cipro_ I had the same symptoms as before only worse. I finished my last dose and hope that I am one of the lucky ones that do not have long lasting side effects.,With all of the antibiotics on the market_ I can't believe Doctors would prescribe this one. I cannot function at all on Cipro. It really infuriates me that I was told by two doctors that my symptoms were not caused by Cipro when it is clear that many people have reported these very same side effects.,F,37,5  days500 MG 2X D,7/27/2011,Cipro
616, 1, diverticulitis symptoms,on the 10th day of taking Cipro_ I woke up in am and could not walk due to extreme achilles pain.  Since then_ and it has been OVER 3 years_ I have tendon (which of course includes joints) pain all over my body and it has severely limited all activities from walking_ yoga to housework_ cooking (opening a jar is painful or impossible) and I have pain every minute of every day and it HAS NEVER improved.  At times it seems like a bit less and other times it flares up severely.  I have not found anything that helps (nsaids etc.).  The worst part is I find most doctors don't know anything about it and/or don't believe me or think it must be something else going on..... Also_ I contacted the maker's of Cipro several times just to get info or validation and they absolutely don't respond in any way except to have it documented with the FDA...and they sure haven't gotten in touch with me!,the black box warning appeared a couple months after I took Cipro.  I fit the criteria for most at risk and they knew about problems for many years_ and had theywillingly put the warning sooner I would not have taken it.

I knew I hadn't bumped it_ so as it was the 4th weekend_ and my doctor unavailable_ went to local ""walk-in"" clinic.  Didn't know what it was_ but suggested I go to ER if it developed redness.  Late that day I had bright red area 1"" x 4"" down center of swelling.  Went to ER.  I mentioned that I'd recently been on Cipro_ and could that have caused this.  Didn't know.

When hospitalized and receiving iv delivery_ asked if ibuprophen could be used for pain management and was given 800 mg tid.

Hoping that over time strength will improve.,My condition warranted the use of strong antibiotic therapy.  However_ under no circumstances should nsaids be given in combination with this drug.

Finally calmed down and slept after 4 days of not sleeping at all. Weakness in legs. Trouble thinking straight and worsened ADD.,This drug should either be taken off the market or used as a last resort. Also there should be clear warnings on the label about not taking the drug with NSAIDS such as Ibprofen. I didn't learn that the two were contraindicated until it was too late. Apparently NSAIDS keep you from breaking down the drug properly which can allow it to build up to toxic levels in your system. This drug should also never be given to people who have conditions such as depression. If you have a toxic reaction to this drug the best thing you can do is get glutathione (a detoxifying amino acid found in our bodies) injections. That is what I did and it helped tremendously. Recommended glutathione dose is 600mg 3 times a week. Must be injected for full benefit. Cipro deeply imbeds itself in tissue which is why detoxifying right away to prevent further side effects and damage_ is so important. I feel like I'm still having some trouble thinking straight_ but I think most of the other side effects have cleared up. I found the following two websites helpful for support in my healing: http://fqvictims.org/fqvictims/index.htm and http://www.survivingcipro.com/.

This all happened when I took my last dose od Cipro. Now I'm self treating with amino acid supplements_ arnica for inflammation_ senna (for GI)_ and drinking lots of cranberry juice(low soidium/sugar) and of course lots of water. No junk food. It's been 2 weeks and symptoms are improving,I am an active person. Running & resistance training. I cannot  exercise again until tendinitis is under control.   Update: My symptoms are doing better. Stopped taking anti-inflammatory at the advice of other sufferers. Prior to stopping symptoms were better. Saw a orthopedic doctor. Said he's never treated a Cipro damaged patient but has read about it. Said to treat as though I have a sport injury and try not to bear weight on muscles until inflammation subsides. Encouraged me to stretch a little each day until no pain when stretching then gradually add weight. The will strengthen muscle so tendon doesn't tear. My headaches are gone. Eating veggies as raw as possible (high in magnesium). Absolutely no junk food or processed food (can or package). No alcohol or sugary food. As soon as I do I get a headache with joint pain. I'm drinking lots of cranberry juice(low in sugar and salt). Cranberry is an antioxidant & high in Vitamin C. I'll report again in a couple of weeks.  Update#2   It's been about 5 weeks and started taking magnesium/calcium supplements.  Helps with pain.  Still anytime I use a muscle my tendons become inflamed.   Also joint pain is constant.  It is difficult to carry or do normal activities without feeling some pain.  Seeing a Rheumatologist next week.

660, 1, UTI,After the 3 dose_ my legs started to feel 'weird'. I started having problems walking and I felt pain in my achilles tendons. I exercise every day and when I went to the gym_ I found all I could do was walk 2 miles per hour on the treadmill_  I usually run at 6miles per hour. Everytime I tried to increase the speed my legs_ knees felt like they were going to give out. I spent 30 minutes on the treadmill and went back to my job. After 1 hour_ I started to feel nausea after eating 2 crackers_  then I felt like I was fainting and started sweating and felt so bad that I had to lay down on the floor. After 30 minutes_  my nausea passed and I left work and went to the ER. I could barely walk_  my legs were so weak_ I had shooting pains in my achilles tendon_ numbness and pins and needles feeling from the knee down.  My heart _ blood and liver checked out ok at the ER.  I was not taking any more CIPRO. The next day_ I am at home resting and the side effects are isolated to my knees down. I am,I took 3 doses and then when I started to feel the side effects _ I looked up CIPRO and read the black box warning.  I have asthma and take steriods and MY DOCTOR NEVER TOLD ME the warning.  She never told me any of the possible side effects.  I just got off the phone with her and told her that because I take Advair/steriods she should have never prescribed this medicine. The black box warning states not to take in combination with corticosteroids but my doctor stated that since Advair is inhaled corticosteroid it is not included. I told her that I disagreed and that my symptoms fit exactly with the warning. She said this happens in less than 1% of patients and thats why she prescribed it for me.DO NOT TAKE THIS CIPRO unless you will die without it. I went from running 3 miles at 6miles per hour to walking like an old lady in TWO days of this medicine. I am so worried and it was not worth it for a UTI that I could have taken another antibotic.,F,40,2  days250 MG 2X D,5/26/2011Email,Cipro
661, 1, Diverticulitis,Bless ALL of you for this site and your comments. I am SO SORRY for all of you that have suffered horribly at the hands of this poison. You basically saved my life. I was prescribed this 'medication' yesterday for accute diverticulitis. I took only 1 (one) 500mg dose and had a terrible headache. Then i couldnt sleep last night_ even with Ambien_ which was strange. I woke up this morning feeling generally terrible with a bad headache_ jawache_ general malaise. Pain behind my eyes_ feel jittery.So_ I thought darn - could I be having a reaction to this stuff? Then I found this site and was floored. I can't believe it is still legal_ it has hurt so many people so badly.,I immediately stopped taking this thanks to all of you. Luckily I only took one pill yesterday and am starting to slowly feel better. I flushed the rest and will be having a 'conversation' with my doctor about this poison. I think it is a horrible shame that the FDA_ which is supposed to be protecting us allows the continued sale and use of these poisons. I have occasional accute knee pain due to knee reconstruction that occasional warrants narcotic pain meds. It is like trying to slay a dragon to get a few pain meds to manage the pain for a limited duration. The FDA makes it almost impossible to get these_ but they allow doctors to hand this poison out like they are chicklets. I found the same thing with anti-depressants. I sometimes have generalized anxiety attacks and take lorazepam which works wonders. I am constantly being pushed to go on tons of anti-depressants. I tried em once and it's like someone performed a lobotomy on me. Just makes me sad. Bless all of you and thank you - I pray that you recover.,F,38,1  days500 MG 2X D,5/24/2011,Cipro

With the Cipro I traded one problem for a couple others and i very much regret ever taking the cipro! I have lost a huge amount of weight because of this drug. I am terrified of food because i get so sick after eating and when i do eat i take a few bites and feel full as if i can't eat no more.

664, 1, Epididymitis,Superficial muscle spasms which I would qualify as low level peripheral neuropathy.   Low level pain in knees_ ankles.,The warning leaflet was interesting: Tendon ruptures in the elderly.  Seeing this drug is fluorine based and that fluorine and any chemical containing fluorine is HIGHLY toxic I did some research.  Thank Heaven Almighty for the internet.  Thank all you brave people victimized by this drug for posting your comments on the internet.  I took this drug 1.5 days.  After swallowing the last pill it occured to me I MAY have been poisoned by this drug back in 92 making my life a living hell of malise_ uncontrollable migratory muscle spasming and weakness-and set the stage for tendonitis and knee meniscus breakdown years later.  Within 1/2 hour of taking the last pill I slammed milk_ 200mg zinc and 150 mg magnesium to block absorption.  I made the doctor switch me to doxycycline.  Two days later I am still having superficial migratory muscle spasms but the joint pains have stopped.  If I had done the full 14 day cycle I dare not think what could have happened.  I cannot afford to be an invalid at 41 with a family of 5 to support.  The drug works very well at killing offending bacteria but the cost is not worth it.  I'll suffer a painful prostate and testicle for a month while slower working doxycycline does its thing.

665, 3, UTI Cystitis,On day two i had severe muscle pain in my thighs_ particularly in the quadriceps. I got them massaged_ that made them feel better. However the pain went away after the third day_ despite the fact that I continued the Ciprofloxacin. Ive read some reviews and it seems that this drug is causing crazy side effects in certain people. Thank God none of them struck me. Ive also noticed though that most of the people that experienced the side effects were older than me. I'm 26_ male with a healthy life style.,It wasn't really that bad for me. Reading most of the reviews in this blog I feel i've been lucky not to be effected so adversely as some of the other users. There was slight muscle pain on two_ but it went away. HOWEVER as soon as I completed my prescribed dose ( 7 days_ 500 mg x 2)_ my symptoms have returned. I felt almost completely cured while I was on the dose. Now that i've stopped taking_ basically because i've finished my prescription_ my symptoms have re-appeared. I'll consider trimethoprim or an alternate this time_ this decision is influenced by the reviews you guys have posted. Better safe than sorry_ i'll avoid it.,M,26,7  days500 mg 2X D,5/15/2011,Cipro

I was given Ativan in the beginning and became dependent on the medication. I took a product available at Point of Return's website called ""Support"" along with their other products promoting glutathione which I've read is the best thing you can do when you've become intoxicated from Cipro; alternated Support with Immonocal at times. I also took Jigzaw magnesium which is supposed to bind to the cipro and dispell it out of the system. For the first year and 2 months_ could not do exercise without extreme pain in back and neck. It was then that I looked into Atlas Orthogonal Chiropractic and along with tapering off the medications_ I am now 100% recovered.

I noticed no difference in anything_ except lightning fast healing.,I was so freaked out by reading some of the horrid comments here that I hesitated 24 hrs to take Cipro_ which as it turns out was my biggest mistake - hesitating.  I don't doubt some had issues but everyone is different and I think most people w/ adverse reactions are more likely to post.  So here is my good news for you_ I had no side effects and I had immediate stoppage of my infection.  When I say immediate_ I mean it.  The infection & drainage stopped and I started healing after a couple hours of first dose.

After a sleepless night spent in excruciating pain I ended up having to be taken to a Chinese hospital (which is a horror show in its own right) by a friend who is a pharmacist.

I ended up being put on a regiment of berberine hydrochloride which I was skeptical of at first_ but it within 15 minutes I was still exhausted and dehydrated but I was feeling instantly better.

Next year found low_ dropping platelet count_ bottoming at 11k - not tested for 18 months_ with frequent rupturing (not caused by external injury) and bruising (especially in thighs_ arms and legs).  Then heavy attack of petechiae (lower legs red) and pain where Achilles tendon starts (both sides).,"This is a follow-up to my 30 Oct 2010 post.  Quinolone antibiotics are derived from quinine_ which can affect platelets; petechiae is an adverse effect of Cipro (& ITP)_ as is Achilles tendon rupture.  Switching to a gluten-free diet to increase serotonin raised my platelet level appreciably for the first time in 2 years_ with no medication (the pharmaceutical tactic is to keep serotonin in the synapses longer with SSRIs rather than produce more).  Ater what must have been lower than 11k to allow later petechiae_ the count went up to 39k in a few months - the physician commented they have no understanding of the processes involved (their previous IVIG treatment had zero effect).  The flourine component in this drug may also cause problems_ and I am noting posts about joint weakness and collagen depletion_ advising the use of MSM and other supplements.  Doctors have a mindset that once a drug is ""out of your system"" it has ceased to cause effects_ but since Cipro works to upset bacterial DNA replication_ in some people it may catalyze adverse effects that are 'relatively permanent' - this is how a single pill can set so much devastation into motion.",M,50,1  days 1X D,1/27/2011,Cipro

Within 4 hours I experienced terrible throbbing pain in my left leg after taking only two doses.  Later on the same day it became throbbing pain in the entire leg from hip to ankle.  I stopped taking Cipro immediately when I noticed the side effects. (luckily the pharmacist had previously warned me to watch out for these signs) I could not find any relief for the throbbing pain.  I read on the internet to try loading up on calcium to counteract the drug.  It has seemed to help alleviate some of the severe pain.  Today I am resting with my leg propped up and this is helping.

I caught bronchitis_ and I was very sick. I had a bacterial infection_ but Cipro was the first medicine that the doctor put me on_ without ever trying another medicine. It made me so incredibly ill that the cure was worse than the illness. I do not feel like I will ever be the same again after taking this medicine. I was told to take it for 10 days and only took it for 5. Now_ one week later_ I can barely still muster up the energy to cook myself a meal before I have to head back to bed.

Had taken it before without severe side affects so I didn't realize it was the medication until I had taken it for 2 months. Extreme pain in muscles_ tendons_ ligiments. Difficulty walking_ standing_ sitting. Severe plurisy. Pain in every joint and muscle. Difficulty sleeping although exhausted. Face continued to break out. Swelling of ankles_ feet_ legs. Was told I had fibromyalgia and swelling was due to working outside in the heat. Was tested for blood clots in my leg. Stopped taking it and took prednisone for 1 week. This helped but only slightly. Went to Sports Medicine doc who got me off the Cipro immediately. Got a cortisone shot in my knee. He suggested water aerobics and after 6 months I am feeling so much better. I still have itching and tingling of forearm_ but now doing workouts 5 days a week without pain. Will NEVER EVER use this drug again or anything in the same family of drugs.

767, 1, UT pain,Quickly developed basal thumb joint arthritis such that I dropped a glass while washing it and had to finish the dishes with one hand.  Severe diarrhea.  Pain in both Achilles tendons.  Pain in right shoulder and shooting pains in palms of hands.  This was 6 years ago and I still have the basal joint arhritis_ shoulder pain and_ intermittently_ Achilles tendon pain in one ankle.,An ophthalmic version is Zymaxid which I took reluctantly for eye surgery Sep. 2010.  Although the Physicians Desk Reference says the blood concentration using this drop is 1/1000 or less than caused by the tablets_ I still have experienced new arthritis in one finger_ intensification of the basal joint and shoulder pain_ and more frequent recurrence of the tendon pain.  And_ hello_ smart-mouthed doctors:  don't tell me I already had arthritis anyway.  I had no basal joint pain before first taking cipro_ and a detailed X-ray 2 weeks after the pain developed showed no joint lesions.  Lesions did_ however_ show up on an X-ray a year later.  Hello_ also_ suffering patients: even Bayer and the FDA has now admitted people need to be more careful with this antibiotic - notice went out a year or two ago.  Most importantly_ it should only be used as a last resort and only when the target pathogen has been identified.  So any MD who blows you off about the side effests is only ignorant and open to a well-deserved lawsuit.  Finally_ to the men who have tried it or might try it for prostatitis:  if you're going to experiment with drugs for this condition_ try to get a doctor to prescribe Valtrex first.  After 18 miserable months with the UT pain I had originally been prescribed Cipro for_ I found serendipitously that a couple of days on Valtrex fixed it for months.

I cannot sleep due to the pain or the insomnia which I now have.  I went to my doctor after suffering these symptoms and she refused to acknowledge that it was the drug that was causing my ailments and suggested that I see a psychiatrist.  I did not take her recommendation and instead visited a homeopath who treated me for the drug's effects.  I came out walking and moving with less pain_ but still have milder versions of the symptoms 2 weeks later_ it seems to get worse when it is cold.  It will take time for my body to remove it from my system_ as according to the Warnings reactions can happen months after finishing the medication.

I won't deny its effective. The problem is it nearly killed me. My story is similar to others youll read here. When I first took Cipro_ I was in my 30s_ active and fit_ working for a large law firm.  I didn't know at first what caused my symptoms. I assumed the dizziness_ fatigue and migraine headaches were caused by my ear infection. My doctor refused to admit my symptoms were adverse reactions to the drug.  As I continued to take Cipro_ the symptoms became harder to ignore. In 2001_ I had convulsions so severe that I went for MRIs and CT scans of my skull. Good news: no brain tumor. Bad news: no prognosis. It was the Anthrax scare of October 2001 that alerted me to the problem. Postal workers refused to take Cipro because of the same side-effects I had suffered myself for years. My doctor was still skeptical_ and the substitute he prescribed turned out to be another kind of FQ. My symptoms continued until 2003_ when I found myself in ERs three times with anxiety attacks and disorientation.  I lost my job because I could no longer focus or concentrate.  In 2004_ I finally took charge of my own care and found the answers on the Web.  Support forums on adverse reactions to FQs alerted me to the cause_ and provided advice on controlling the symptoms.  It took five years_ and continuing dietary restrictions_ but I have finally controlled this hell-on-earth.  I am in a new job and successful once again.

If you try it_reduce the magnesium as soon as you feel better as it is not recommended to take over 200/300mg per day. I am back on my usual intake: 650mg of calcium a day_ 2000 I.U. of D3 & 200mg of magnesium at dinner time_ it relaxes my muscles & may be tendons?& helps me sleep.Calcium helps in neutralizing Cipro's action & magnesium relaxes muscles.

780, 1, Prostatitas,Everything similar to all the people who have been chemicaly poisoned.,"ATTENTION: You want help-stay away from your doctor. Cipro or fluoroquinans inhibits the production of the good protiens (Collegen) in your body. This is man made chemical poisoning. Okay now what you should do.1. Stop your F%cking medication-don't flush it cuz your putting that junk in your water_ personally I'd send the crap back to Bayer and let them eat.2.Do not take-Steroids_ Ibuprofen-this is bad!!_ Aspirin3.Eat protien-Eat bone broth-go to butcher get beef soap bones-big ones with the marrow-crock pot those bad boys for a day on low. Pour off liquid let cool and skim off the layer of fat. Drink the broth-you are giving your body the amino acids to repair the collegen-tendons joints etc.4. Keep moving-if you are stuck in a chair fall off it and roll_ then crawl_ then walk-go slow-you want to keep you body moving so it will stamp out new protiens for your joints. Eventually the ratio of defective ""cipro innfected stamps' will decrease overtime. How much time-thats a case by case situation.5.Get in a pool-Float the low resistance on those joints will help rebuild them. You will feel better mentally with some excercise.6 Don't give up hope. no one will beleive you hurt as much as you do. They will tell its just age. Scew em.

Called my doctor and stopped it immediately. ,Does anyone know why that happens with this medication?,F,33,3  days250MG 2X D,11/22/2010Email,Cipro
784, 1, Cough_ upper resp infection,I am in tears reading these posts. I never would have thought the swelling in my legs would have been caused by this until today. My left leg is slightly swelled as well as the ankle but my right leg looks like the michellin man's leg. Literally bulges....my ankle is completely swollen to where I can barely move my foot. I really hope that since I finished it this morning that this will go away. I can't believe I was this stupid to keep taking it.,Avoid this medication at all costs...read everyone's posts!,F,41,10  days500 2X D,11/21/2010Email,Cipro
785, 3, Bacterial gastroenteritis/e.coli,Sore neck_ aching body but the worse was the terrible nightmares last night_ dreaming I was dreaming but nightmares occured in both dream states_ possibility of the dreams of me dreaming were hallucinations in some parts. Really disturbing nightmares too.,This medicine made me feel better within 1 day so cant fault it for that but am now scared to take it because nightmares is considered very rare affecting less than one in ten thousand ppl. Gonna ring doctor later to get advice,F,27,2  days500mg 2X D,11/19/2010,Cipro
786, 1, Bladder Infection,Horrific graphic real nightmares.  Restlessness and anxiety.,I will never take another drug again without reading the warning signs first.

787, 1, Kidney Infection,I went to the doctor because of one thing.  When I got there I was told something else - that I had a kidney infection. (I don't believe this to be true).  While at the hospital I was treated with one bag of levaquin and a ten day supply of cipro.  I had the bag at the hospital took one pill that night at bed time and another the next morning with breakfast.  By the afternoon of the second day (two pills in) my entire body hurt and I could barely walk.  I went from marathon training to difficulty walking even to the kitchen. I only took two pills and have not taken another in 3 weeks.,Does anyone know when the pain will go away and I can go back to running?,F,30,1  days 2X D,11/16/2010Email,Cipro
788, 1, uti,tendonitis everywhere_ muscle twitches_ anxiety_ insomnia_ popping joints... Insomnia was gone in 48 hrs. The moderate muscle/tendon pain went away after 2 weeks but flares up randomly here and there.  My joints pop 8 months after taking 2 of the cipro pills. Every joint I have is creaky and pops so loud. The only thing that helps is magnesium. Cipro interferes with your body's ability to use magnesium. My symptoms have slowly morphed over time. I hope in another year I'm symptom free. Fingers crossed. It's a slow recovery. And I'm 23 and was in great shape before taking it.,GET MAGNESIUM and take it every day.  If I miss it for 2 or 3 days_ my joints pop more_ I get really tight muscles_ muscle twitches_ and even a lump in my throat and trouble swallowing. Magnesium is the only thing I have found to help. Take it easy on the exercise_ your joints are weakened and will wear down quicker.,F,23,1  days 1X D,11/14/2010,Cipro
789, 4, mastoiditis,"""spacey"" feeling; dizziness; general malaise; felt like a war was going on inside my body; hip joint pain & stiffness",I was prescribed a fairly high dosage due to the difficulty of treating a bone infection with oral antibiotics.  (This was an alternative to in-patient IV antibiotics.) Side effects lasted for the first 5 days or so_ then tapered off.  The only remaining side effect (3 weeks after finishing course) is left hip pain & stiffness.  This seems to be a tendinitis_ and it is resolving with rest and daily stretching.  In my case_ the drug worked well and although the side effects were unpleasant for a few days_ it allowed me to continue to work instead of having an in-patient hospital stay.,F,50,10  days500mg 2X D,11/13/2010Email,Cipro
790, 3, lyme_ h. pylori,none,I think it's useful to realize that all these side-effects people complain of are EXACTLY the same as the effects of Lyme disease and other similar diseases.  Perhaps_ these aren't side effects at all_ but actually a latent infection manifesting itself as the bacteria dies.  This is well known as a herxheimer reaction.  90% of people with Lyme disease do not realize they are infected.  I was infected for 15 years before figuring it out.

I am bed ridden except when hydrochone is taken.  Must start Navigator with a pair of pliers_ cannot lift most pillows_ difficulty trying to wipe in bathroom_ pain is worse than child birth_ vision changes_ foggy thinking and pain changes places to hurt....involving two to three places at a time.

794, 1, UTI,I think I managed to get 2 pills in me before I ended up at the ER due to red blotches all over my body and horribly swollen & painful joints (knees/ankles especially). It was twice as bad from the time I left my house to the time the doctor came in the room. I couldn't even walk by then. Never had any type of reaction to an antibiotic like this before.,This happened quite a few years ago_ and they put me in the hospital and tried to come up with some other reason for all my symptoms_ but I was fine the day before I started taking this medication_ and finding this web site has confirmed my belief that it was *all* coming from the Cipro. Never had an issue like this since.,F,32,1  days 2X D,11/4/2010Email,Cipro

796, 5, Chronic UTI's and Kidney infections,I will have to say that cipro is a life saver!!! I have suffered from chronic uti's and kidney infections for the past 7 months and have been put on cipro 5 times for these nasty infections. I have been on numerous antibiotics including septra_ bactrim_ macrobid_ etc for my chronic uti's and nothing has helped me more then cipro. I will admit you will get a range of nasty side effects including panic attacks_ anxiety_ insomnia_ headaches_ heart palpitations_ indigestion_ heartburn_ yeast infections_ body aches and pains etc but to me it was worth the side effects. You just have to get through the first 4 days and then the side effects subside.

800, 1, Antibiotic-induced colitis,Immediately after taking first and only pill small red bumps appeared on chest_ over next month both arms were covered with clusters of spontaneous bruises; next year found platelet count was dropping and they were over-sized.  Intravenous immunoglobulin had no effect_ even temporarily; spleen found normal on ultra-sound.  Last tested in mid-2009_ platelet count was 11k. Recently suffered severe petechiae on both legs_ and continue to have swollen rashes behind both calves_ and pain where muscles attach to Achilles tendon; red skin is irritated_ feeling like a bad sunburn.,Cipro attacks the gyrase protein to interfere with replication of bacterial DNA.  Mediation of adverse effects has been found through increasing the ratio of ADP (stored in platelets) to ATP_ by up-regulating cyclic AMP: this is done through the ligand of Gs-coupled GPCR - with the 5-HT receptor_ the natural ligand is serotonin_ an important component of platelets.  This could explain why platelet counts have been reported to increase with consumption of papaya and a gluten-free diet_ both of which increase the serotonin level_ which can also be supplemented with L-tryptophan and 5-HTP.  Started on this unpleasant and restrictive diet recently_ and have observed some improvement with the lower legs_ though I was apparently close to being crippled by the steady_ relentless attack of this extremely unsafe drug_ beyond its having induced the life-threatening macrothrombocytopenia (typically an hereditary condition that has never been diagnosed in my family).,M,50,1  days500MG 2X D,10/30/2010,Cipro
801, 3, diverticulitis,After taking Cipro for 7 days_ developed horrible red_ raised ITCHY rash over most of my body.  Druggist and doctor both told me to stop Cipro immediately and take Benadryl for rash symptoms,Three days after stopping CIPRO_ red raised bumps keep reappearing all over my torso and itching only relieved with Benadryl (makes me sleepy) and hydrocortisone  Itching almost unbearable at times.,F,60,7  days500 mg 2X D,10/29/2010,Cipro
802, 1, diarrhea and vomiting,Immediately my diarrhea and vomiting went away_ but myself and my stomach weren't feeling any better.  All the way until about 10 days after I was on the drug did my stomach finally start to feel better.  The big thing was this long term effect that I've had since I was on the drug... Insomnia.  I've never had sleeping problems before I took Cipro for this length.  I had used Cipro before_ but only 1-2 pills.  I could not sleep and was always tired during the day.  I went to GNC and became tolerant to all their sleep aids within a month or so.  Went to a sleep specialist and became tolerant to all the drugs he gave me rather quickly.  I was even drinking myself to sleep_ awful.  Apparently_ the best place in the country for this type of disorder is Hopkins and I have been with them once a week for two months.  Although I have improved from 3 months ago_ I want to get to sleep!  Here it is almost a year later and over $1_000 later_ I still have terrible insomnia.,,M,25,10  days500mg 3X D,10/27/2010,Cipro
803, 5, UTI,None.,I've had 5 incredibly severe and very quickly progressing UTIs over my life (first symptoms at 5pm_ bleeding from urethra at 10pm)and was prescribed Cipro in the emergency room and in the doctor's office. It always worked SO wonderfully and was like a miracle to me.     Reading over all the unfortunate side effects makes me sad to hear how other people have fared with it_ but I felt like those are the people most likely to write a review.  I wanted to give the other side_ in that it can be very helpful_ with no side effects for certain people.,F,35,7  days 1X D,10/25/2010,Cipro
804, 2, Suspect prostatitis,Quite severe Diarrhoea and flatulence and some slight muscle pains in the legs.After speaking to the Consultant we have decided to stop taking this and perhaps try another antibiotic BUT I will be very careful about what I take.,Following a flexible cystoscopy some inflammation was seen as the instrument was drawn out through the prostate so CYPRO was prescribed.  It has done absolutely nothing for the frequent urination problem. At first enlarged prostate was suspected but scans proved the prostate was_ if anything_ smaller than usual for a man of my age. The consultant said 'the last thing you need is an operation' which is why the cystoscopy was done.,M,67,17  days250mg 2X D,10/24/2010,Cipro
805, 1, possible diverticulitis,Horrible joint pain_ especially in both knees and both ankles.  Right foot is now totally numb due to a dead ligament killed by cipro.  Now I have horrible pains in both of my shoulders and elbows.  Completely bedridden now.,The doctors are absolutely horrible.  Totally dishonest.  They tell me it's in my head.  The doctor that originally prescribed me this garbage totally denies its a side effect.  I keep asking them if it is so safe why don't they take this crap. I thought doctors were upright now I know most are totally morally corrupt.  I've tried almost ever supplement known_ Ginkgo_ Bilberry_ NAC_ Vitamin C_ undenatured collagen - nothing works. Now trying Chlorella but it prob. won't work either.  Any ideas?  It's been 14 months since I got floxed and its still getting worse.,M,54,7  days500 2X D,10/22/2010Email,Cipro
806, 1, chronic prostatitis/epididymitus,I had ringing in my ears instantly from taking this. After about 10 days my tendon in my left foot made me hobble around for a further 3. I had wierd feelings in my face also. The thing is_ I've stopped taking this atrocity yet still have tinnitus after 14 days cypro-free... I have no idea how long this could last for_ if it will cease or remain? The body is the best healer. Don't blindly accept consultants/doctors/surgeons ideas like I did. Do the research_ get the perscription in a 'just incase' mind set and always seek alternative therapy. My condition lessened from items considered folk remedies or illegitimate according to Western medicine. Remember its all a business to them. In this case the antibiotics did absolutely nothing to help me.,Just don't.,M,22,14  days750mg 3X D,10/21/2010,Cipro

I've been fatigued ever since_ at times so badly I could hardly stand the pain walking up the stairs.  I am a very upbeat energetic person (morning person at that) and I've totally lost interest in any activity becaue of the pain.  Had to go back to the docs for a UTI/Kidney infection and just finished another dose...I wish I had found this website first.  I'm worse now than before and I was just starting to feel better.  I never associated all this with the medicine_ I just assumed I had picked something up during the Mission Trip.  It's very upsetting to think I might suffer another several months of these side effects...as it is my family is suffering along with me because ""Mommy is not herself"".  :o(  Praying that God will fix this through some other means.",F,39,5  days? 1X D,10/19/2010,Cipro

I'm wondering how long the tendinitis will last - Very depressing to have a normal active lifestyle altered in this manner.  I was switched to Macrobid after having so much trouble with the Cipro - I'm wondering why I wasn't given Macrobid in the first place_ since the warnings clearly indicate a problem especially for those over 60.  I'm now suspicious of all prescription medicine_ and thoroughly disgusted with the FDA for allowing Cipro to remain on the market.,F,62,5  days500 2X D,10/14/2010Email,Cipro

I already am a pain patient_ from a military injury and this put my pain over the top. I am having stomach problems_ ankle_ legs_ back... PAIN is unreal. I am no longer able to work. I went into septic shock after 7 days and cipro was given to save my life. I was also given another antibiotic along with this... I feel like crap. It has been 2 years and I still am recovering. I don't think I will ever be the same. I hope that we can help get something that is safer. Less side effects.

I was still nauseated & started feeling anxious for some reason. I called the Pharmacist after the 4th day & he told me that it was normal for Cipro to cause joint pain because it softens the cartilage? WTH? & not to do any strenuous activity & since I was nearly 1/2 way through my treatment to just keep taking it. Well I was supposed to take it for 10 days & only lasted 7.

832, 1, Sinusitis,Side effects came after course of drugs done in other words_ way too late - severe and crippling pain in hip all the way to ankle - spontaneous tendon rupture_ bruises appear out of nowhere on my legs - 2 seizures_ never had a seizure in my life except for 25 years ago coming out of anesthesia - first 6 hours of the day agony_ may have 2-3 hours a day ok_ with heavy doses of pain killers and ibuprofen. Absolute poison. Unacceptable level of risk. Not living in fear_ but it is always on my mind - will I have another seizure? Or rip other tendons? Will I need surgery_ a hip replacement_ what could possibly come next?,"These side effects have been going on for almost a month. This drug has changed my life - I can no longer do stairs_ no way lawn work or housework without risking tendon tears_ never mind the pain - wondering how much longer I can make it into work. Clinical doses of Ibuprofen seems to help some_ but not without narcotics. I am almost past the ""I can't believe it"" stage and am entering the angry stage. I see my doctor in a few days - the same one who prescribed it. I am not holding my breath that he will admit to knowledge of the effects - wouldn't that be a liability on his part?

835, 1, Urinary Tract Infection,This drug was very bad news for me_ and I had many of the issues described by others here. I am a 40 year old male_ very healthy and strong overall.  An arthritic condition began to set in after just 4 days on the Cipro (prescribed for a garden variety urinary tract infection)_ and within 2 more weeks_ the pain was so debilitating that my family forced me to go to the ER. My entire body hurt_ particularly my hips_ shoulders_ lower back_ hands and feet.  My knees and elbows for some reason were virtually unaffected. I couldn't even put on shoes_ let alone tie them_ I had to crawl up the stairs_ and I had to shower after using the toilet because I couldn't wipe myself. The pain was so intense that I needed help getting in and out of bed_ rolling over_ etc. during the night. I sincerely thought I could be dying.  After seeing that a couple of the numbers from my blood tests were very abnormal_ the ER doctors grew concerned and gave me IV pain medication and anti-inflammants (the abnormal,I would not take this drug ever again unless my life depended on it_ and would not let anyone else I knew take it_ either_ without at least warnimng them.  It may be fine for some_ but it clearly causes severe problems for many_ and even in my instance_ where I've gotten at least most of the way back to normal again_ there are still lingering effects_ and I first took Cipro over 2 months ago_ and was only on it for 4 days before I stopped taking it.,M,40,4  days500 MG 2X D,9/20/2010,Cipro

In June of this year_ I was once again perscribed Cipro for Prostititis.  On the second day_ I experienced significant and severe abdominal cramps and spine pain.  I stopped taking it.  My doctor then put me on doxycycline and an NSAID (Nuproxen)  I found out that was the worst thing anyone can do_ from additional research it maximizes the side effects of Ciprofloxacin.  Three months after taking the last pill_ I have had it all: Joint Paint_ Tendon Pain_ Cartilage and Tendon Popping_ Insomnia_ Myalgia type pains and sensations_ Eye Pain_ Headaches_ Muscle Weakness and Stiffness_ Numbness & Tingling_ Tremors & Twitching_ Cold Hands & Feet_ Burning Sensations and the list goes on & on....,If anyone has had success in detoxifying from this poison_ please post what has worked for you.

Kaiser's phone doc (kaiser is the worst) instructed me to stop taking it immediately and take benedryl_ no mention of how bad/sick I would feel and for how long. I am now 14 days of the cipro and still not feeling 100%. my boyfriend became so worried by my lingering symptoms he insisted i go back to see a doc in person and when i did_ not only was i not told about what symptoms i might be still experiencing_ the male doctor told me i must be depressed_ and_  'well_ you look good!'gee thanks for your blatant disregard and unprofessionalism. i guess the drug companies really are paying the physicians to shut up. btw_ i am a psychologist.,F,42,3  days500 mg 2X D,9/17/2010,Cipro

I got off it after day 2 due to panic_ anxiety_ throbbing_ felt like i was on caffiene x about 100 times that_ could not sleep at all for 2 nights because I was so anxious_ and worst of all the leg surges in my right calf muscle. And_ 2 days later I'm off this and I'm still getting these horrible heat surges in my right calf muscle. I feel like someone was trying to poison me by me taking this. Stay away from this drug if you can_ not worth it to chance this horrible state I'm in.,Stay away. It is the worst experience of my life.

840, 1, Kidney Infection,*Extreme gastric upset* leading to permanent damage since 2007. Tremors_ sluggish_ fever.,I was prescribed this drug when I arrived at the walk-in clinic_ clutching my side in pain and peeing blood. I was happy to get on the road to feeling better but was I sure in for a surprise. The 'cure' was far worse than the problem. My knees sometimes bugger up_ but what really erks me is the gastric issues I have had ever since taking this poison. My mother_ a nurse_ put me on acidophilus bacteria which helped a lot_ but many years later I still suffer gastric issues like nausea/acid reflux ever since Cipro. It's hard to find a doctor who will hear my plight_ but I am very certain Cipro did something to me. I had a gut of steel before taking this atrocity. Yes_ let's feed people Fluoride!

841, 5, psuedomonas,Severe diarrhea if one takes milk without probiotics first.,Cipro probably saved my life when I had psuedomonas back in 1990. I have had to take it a number of times both as I.V. and pill form for as long as 45 days at a time. I usually feel better within hours of the first dose_ and it continues to work a few days after no longer taking it. I am shocked at all the negative comments. Maybe I was so near death it could only help_ or maybe God is just taking care of me. I feel really badly for those it hurt because I have had other meds mess me up and I sympathize with the hurt and outrage. I hope each of you gets better very soon.,M,53,20  years750 mg 2X D,9/14/2010,Cipro
842, 3, UTI,"I took this drug 2 years ago for a UTI.  It initially caused me diarrhea_ stomach discomfort_ and something close to a yeast infection (but I didn't have to treat it_ I ate yogurt and it went away upon finishing the antibiotic).  2 1/2 months later_ I pulled my calf muscle severely while playing basketball... at the time I was only jogging down the court.  I always found this odd_ I did plenty of more strenuous activity for years.  Ever since_ I keep having recurring calf strains from very little activity... walking_ stretching in my sleep.  It keeps me from running like I used to.  Never would have connected it to Ciprofloxacin or a drug in general.  I pulled my calf again last night in my sleep_ which is how I ended up here... I simply googled ""why do I keep pulling my calf muscle"" to find a site that mentioned this as a side effect for Ciprofloxacin.",I can't say for sure that the drug caused my muscle/tendon ailments_ but it is surely suspicious.  I am shocked that the drug I took just 2 months before this 2-year long struggle with my calf muscle can cause problems with tendons_ cartilage_ and muscles.  I certainly could have taken another antibiotic instead... my infection wasn't that bad!  I'm not even sure it made it go away_ I was also drinking lots of water and cranberry juice to flush it out.  My doctor was too busy to see me_ it was her Physician's assistant that prescribed it to me.  There needs to be more awareness out there of these serious side effects!  I will certainly spread the word.  I truly hope there is something I can do to stop my calf muscle issues_ it is somehow comforting to have a possible cause.

Then I began to experience EXTREME fatique (could barely get off the couch)_ abdomenal & low back pain.  It felt like I had the flu.  I elected to stop taking Cipro after the 1st dose on Day 5.  I will say that while my bladder felt better about Day 3_ the other days were hell.  I believe that the dosage was just too high for me (looked at pdrhealth.com to see typical dosages).  Of course it is a Holiday weekend so no way to reach my Dr. but I feel OK getting off of it as the typical dosage seems to be 250mg x 2/day x 3 days.,Seems to have done its job but made me feel sicker in the process.,F,55,10  days500 2X D,9/5/2010,Cipro
847, 1, Sinus Infection,Slight nausea without food_ anxiety/depression_ painful UTI and yeast infection symptoms,I was prescribed multiple rounds of Cipro for sinus infections. Each time I took it_ I would end up with symptoms of a UTI_ after which I was given another antibiotic_ and then ended up with a yeast infection and would need a 3rd round of different medicine. I took probiotics with all of these_ but my body is so out of whack now. The last dose (round 4) of cipro has given me severe symptoms of both UTI and yeast infection at the same time_ so painful that I cannot urinate and have trouble sitting down. My OB-GYN found no trace of infection in my system_ yet the pain continues. I expressed my concern before taking this medicine to my doctor and he insisted it was the only way to fix my sinus infection. I am now in more pain and sicker than I started. I have begun alternative treatments of Chinese herbs_ acupuncture and significantly adjusting my diet and lifestyle to cleanse my system and get better. It has been 5 days and the improvement is just slightly beginning to show. In the long run_ I will likely never take antibiotics again.

I was prescribed a 7 day course of this med by a Locum doctor as my doctor was on holiday. He then re-prescribed it on his return for a further 7 days. It was at day 10 I stopped.

850, 3, Kidney infection/UTI,extreme fatigue_ rash_ itchiness_ no appetite,I'd been ill for a week_ when I saw blood in my urine.  I went to the doctor_ and they tested my urine for blood.  They found blood with their test kit and said it was probably either a UTI or a kidney problem.  Put me on Cipro for 7 days.  I was extremely exhausted while on this drug.  I'm only 33 and am very energetic normally.  I ended up needing to nap while my young kids played around me.  By day 7_ I couldn't wait to be off the medicine - I felt like if I was on it one more day_ I'd die.  A day after I stopped taking it_ it was painful to urinate_ so I started taking Oil of Oregano in case it was a UTI (it wasn't painful at my diagnosis).  I've been off it for 7 days now_ and now I'm having more side-effects.  I now have a rash and I'm itchy everywhere.  If I take a few bites of food I feel like I ate a huge meal - and I can normally eat a lot.  I work out 6 days a week and now all my muscles are very sore_ which is not normal in the least.  From now on_ I will try to prevent a UTI by taking oil of oregano_ vitamin C_ cranberry juice_ and probiotics.

Then I noticed a feeling of heat in my ankle.,Since Diverticulitis is a condition that flares up repeatedly_ I have been on Cipro several times before.  I have also suffered with tendonitis_ but I never tied the two together.  Sadly_ neither did my doctor.  I kept trying to figure out what I was doing that caused the tendonitis to act up_ thinking it was the shoe I was wearing or my activities.  I went for physical therapy and injections of cortisone.  It just kept coming back.  Now_ after taking Cipro for just 3 days_ I experienced severe pain in my left hip_ and then the soreness in the tendons.  A family member did some research and told me that this could be caused by the Cipro.  I called my Doctor and he told me to reduce the dose to once daily rather than twice.  After reading the notes posted on this web site_ I will stop the Cipro completely and seek an alternate medication.,F,58,10  days500 2X D,9/2/2010,Cipro

Day 8: Severe episode of nearly passing out (while driving!)_ tingling in calf muscles_ weakness in legs_ racing/palpitating heart. The documentation says these are serious side effects that require immediate medical attention. Went to ER; changed Rx to Keflex. Cipro side effects continued every day_ sometimes better_ sometimes worse_ so much that my primary care physician sent me to the ER for a second time in 8 days. No one could do anything other than tell me to drink lots of fluids. Have been on at-home heart monitor for the last month. Heart rate spikes any time of day or night as high as 120 bpm and stays there for hours. Try sleeping with that. Five weeks after taking my last pill of Cipro_ the heart irregularities are easing somewhat_ although a new development is that my calf/heel muscles have been tight and burning_ to the point of needing to use some ice. Restlessle,Before taking Cipro_ I was extremely healthy and a frequent exerciser. It has taken more than a month out of my life (so far) and cost me more than $8_000 in ER bills_ not to mention time lost from work_ family_ exercise_ and everything else. I will NEVER take this drug again and will tell everyone I know to stay away unless they have absolutely no other option. It is unconscionable that the manufacturer has no antidote or treatments for the known side effects.

Nausea after eating and upon waking up. Stiff/weak joints.,I was pretty sure that I had a UTI before arriving through the hospital after searching the internet about what could be wrong. I also had pretty harsh pain in my abdomen. After urine and blood samples and a long wait in the ER_ the doctor diagnosed me with a UTI and kidney infection and prescribed me the Cipro.About an hour or so after the first dose I felt nausea. I was dry heaving although I had eaten. I figured I just hadn't eaten enough so I had another snack but the nausea never subsided. It's still day 5 and it hasn't. I jut figured that some antibiotics do this and that would be the worst of it. Wrong!I'm on day 5. For the past 4 days I have had constant abdominal and lower back pain. I find it difficult getting in and out of bed and standing up because my legs feel weak and stiff. The worst was yesterday afternoon. I was confused_ slightly delirious_ and VERY upset. I was depressed and feeling like I should just give up and stay sick because my pain is almost unbearable.This is ridiculous. I have been taking this medication for less than a week_ so I can't imaging what it would be like if I kept swallowing these poison pills for another 5 days.

Well.....aside from the fact that taking it felt 'nuclear' (strange sensation up my throat and nose)_ also caused nervousness and my heart to race along with diarrhea. Well....5 days into it (today!) I woke up with severe tremors and my body felt heavy and I was confused.  I went back to the hospital that prescribed it and the doc said it HAD TO BE THE CIPRO.,CIPRO is horrible and nasty.

I was sick to my stomach for about 80% of the time while being on it_ even throwing up. I also experienced dizziness and pain in my inner ear_ so I thought I had an ear infection. I have been off for several days now but am still having side effects. I had joint pain in my knees and shoulders shortly after taking it and it's still there. I also am still having an odd sensation in my arms_ almost like my muscles are fatigued and hurt_ like I have been working out at the gym recently_ but I have not. I'm very upset the doctor prescribed Cipro to me_ because I had an existing anxiety issue and cardiac problem that I've been doing well coping with_ and I informed the doctor of that. Shortly after beginning Cipro_ my anxiety spiked and my heart began racing despite medicine to help it. I'm still nauseous despite being off the drug for several days_ and hoping it subsides soon. It's hard for me to even sit up w/out being sick. This drug appears to have cured my UTI_ but I recommend it only as a last resort.

Not sure how I managed to have an attack of diverticulitis since I watch what I eat_ and I am (or was) as regular as your alarm clock.  Now_ I'm in the bathroom all the time and believe my system will never be the same. Side effects:  Dark & loose stools at least twice a day_ NO APPETITE_ CRAMPS...

896, 1, UTI,Chills_ fever_ disoriented_ confused_ lightheaded_ weak_ LOW blood pressure and rash.,After a visit to the emergency room it was finally determined that I had a severe UTI. I did have chills_ fever_ and dizziness due to the infection. On the forth day after beginning the medication I went to my own doctor feeling no better. I am diabetic and my blood sugars have dropped more times than I care to count since starting the drug.  My blood pressure which is normally 117/70 with medication is now 80/55. Although we were both concerned with this drop_ I attributed it to being bedridden for a good deal of these now four days. Tonight after taking my scheduled dose I began to put two and two together after noting that my blood sugar dropped_ I became even more confused_ I tried a brisk walk to bring up the pressure but to no avail. So I did some research here and on other sites to find that the body aches_ disorientation_ confusion_ chills_ and low grade fever are due the the CIPRO. I have now developed a red rash all over my lower legs and have not been in the sun at all. I have also noticed decreased urine flow despite many_ many glases of water and swelling of my feet and ankles. I have taken my LAST dose of this terrible medication and pray I suffer no long term affects. It didn't dawn on my own doctor who is an internist/cardiologist with many years of practice that my symptoms could be a reaction to medication...and even prescribed and additional five day regimen since I was not getting any better.,F,65,4  days500 2X D,7/21/2010,Cipro

902, 2, UTI,"heartburn_ tachycardia_ lightheadedness_ nervousness/anxiety_ panic attack_ sleeplessness_ fatigue_ indescribable sense of ""something wrong""",Recently (April 2010) I got a sulfa-resistant UTI and my doc put me on a five-day course of cipro. Three days into it I had a scary episode of racing heart_ lightheadedness_ hyperventilation_ feeling like I was going to pass out_ and a creeping sensation that something was going wrong with my heart. I'm not sure if anything actually WAS wrong or if it was purely a panic attack_ but_ whichever_ it was a bizarre set of symptoms (I have never had a panic attack before).  I discovered that walking briskly improved the symptoms. For the next week I had a string of episodes like this. I did not get any of the tendon or muscle problems described by others and my symptoms vanished rapidly as soon as I went off cipro. Fast forward three months_ I get another resistant UTI_ and I still have a few cipro left - so I take them - yeah I know_ stupid. Day 1 was fine; on day 2 I got the sleeplessness and free-floating anxiety; on day 3 I got the lightheadedness_ the about-to-pass-out feeling_ bad heartburn_ tingly face_ aha_ now I know for sure it's the cipro. The list of symptoms doesn't quite convey how creeped out I feel - this weird body-wide anxiety like I've eaten a toxic mushroom and can actually feel my major organs slowly breaking down. On the plus side it did stop the UTI dead in its tracks. If you have to take this_ don't take it for more than 3 days.,F,45,3  days500mg 2X D,7/15/2010Email,Cipro

Then I had to go to the ER 4 times in 2 months! Cha-ching!  They have no interest in prescribing a less toxic anti-biotic!  Someone at the top of these Corporate Hospitals has planned it this way!",2.5 months later...The Insomnia finally stopped.  Tachycardia much better..Still very short of breath.

It has gotten so bad that I am afriad to go to sleep at night_ just because I know what will await in the morning.

I stopped taking Cipro immediately after these symptoms began because I researched side effects online and found mine were common.  I am a healthy active 34 year old and now I feel like an 80 year old with extreme arthritis all over.  My joints shift and pop and it hurts to hold a pen!  Basic tasks are a struggle.  I have two young children and don't have time to deal with these effects.  I agree with others that state that there are plenty of other antibiotics out there and this should be used as a LAST resort.  This is only the 4th day after stopping the medication and I am going back to the Doctor today for testing.  I will post updates of my progress.

931, 1, UTI,I had a UTI that I had foolishly allowed to advance to the point of needing an antibiotic.  My doctor prescribed me a 3-day course of 500mg 2X per day.  On Friday at 6:00pm I took one single 500mg pill.  I felt fine; I went to bed at 10:30pm and at 12:30 am I woke up with the worst panic attack_ sweaty palms_ rapid heart beat_ and I did not sleep that night.  The next day_ my brain became adulturated with depressing thoughts_ and I knew not to take another pill.  The next evening_ I went to bed at 10:30pm and could not fall asleep until 3:00 am and woke up at 7:00 am.Today_ I feel like I have eaten napalm.  I look like I have been drinking tequila_ and I feel terrible.,Fluoroquinolones are very toxic; they cross the path into your brain.  They destroy your GABA and your melatonin.  Although the damage may not be permanent_ it can take a LONG time to restore it.  So what are the alternatives?Well_ there is a MUCH safer antibiotic for UTI's called MONUROL.  It is a one-time packet that you mix in water.  Unfortunately_ it cannot take care of serious UTS's.  Another alternative sold in health food stores is D-Monnitol.  This herb draws the E.Coli away and clears the problem away.  BUT you can only use this herb once every 8 weeks; you can overdose on it_ and it CAN be fatal.  At least it won't affect your brain like the evil Cipro.,F,41,1  times500mg 1X D,6/20/2010Email,Cipro

I tried to tell the doctor I couldn't tolerate it and should have trusted myself.,I have a metabolism mutation - P450-CYP2D6 and have found I'm affected by other metabolizing methods.

Oh yea_ and a coated tongue.,"After researching as much as I could find from medical journal excerpts_ I am taking a multi-mineral tablet with calcium magnesium_ a tablespoon of Milk of Magnesia during the day and Melatonin Snooze-in which is a blend of Melatonin with calcium magnesium and other herbs which really_ really helps though it makes you sleepy if you take it during the day.

I also take a multivitamin_ D3_ and L-theanine. If you have learned anything else that helps I'd love to hear. I am taking the ""keep moving"" advice to heart.

I tried several treatments to get better. You will be glad to know I am better now_ so keep positive_ it will pass.Here's a list of things that helped me 1) Find the best accupuncturist you can find and explain what happened to you. He or she will then treat your liver and kidneys intensively. The liver toxicity is the main cause for the tendon problems. 2) Simultaniously try and find a very good sports physiotherapist. He or she will treat your muscles and tendons. Traditional_ Thai yoga was also very helpful to sort out some very painful areas in the neck_ back and tendons.3) Try colonic irrigation. This will try to clear out any remaining toxins in your system. Also take active biocultures 4) Try taking a zinc suppliment and some calcium rich food that will help to mop up any resudial cipro 5) Get advice on herbal products -""boswellia"" and ""devils claw"" can help 6) Try taking Siberian ginseng (comes as a tincture - which you can mix with fruit juice) which is a great adaptogenic (means it gently fine tunes your system that has been disturbed)7) Have good healthy clean food 8) Get yourself a regime so you can treat youself easily.

966, 1, prostate infection????,Cipro affects the bodies ability to regenerate collegan. Basicly it turns healthy tendons into string cheese. The way I recovered was to keep active. If you can't walk -crawl. If you can't crawl-roll. Everytime you make a movement your body replaces the protiens in the structure. Cipro blocks this regeneration. Eventually the body will rid itself of this chemical poison. How long is a individual cases by case situation.

I'm currently thinking about talking to an attorney.  I should have been warned by the doctor and the pharmacy.  I know it is a small percentage that have long term effects from this drug_ but we have the right to know before taking.  We shouldn't have to look info up online about a drug prescribed to us.

Write out any negative thoughts down on a piece of paper and then find ways to argue against those thoughts and write those new thoughts down. Recovery is possible but it takes time.

996, 1, diverticulitis,Debilitating wrist pain and weakness.   I can no longer play the guitar_ and sometimes I can't even turn a doorknob.   This SUCKS.,I first took cipro two years ago and it was about that time that the wrist pain started.   I also have developed neck and hip pain at night.   It didn't occur to me that it was cipro_ until I recently was given cipro for diverticulitis again.  This time_ over the first few days of treatment I felt myself freezing up like I was becoming some kind of invertebrate with an exoskeleton.   All the symptoms I'd developed over the past two years escalated:  pain_ stiffness.     So I came here to askapatient_ and ... boom.   It all fell into place.

Thought it was from fatty food I had for dinner.Still noticed numbness on Sunday so stopped Flaygl.Then Monday took Cipro and burst of numbness in arms within 1/2 hour.Told doc he told me to stay on.Tuesday afternoon noticed ringing in my ears and stopped.Today is Friday_ I have been off of it for 3 days_ and still getting numbness in hands and lower legs_ and burning off and on.Really bad numbness everytime I get up from sleeping.I am so scared. Went to GI doc yesturday and he said my GP that put me on Cipro and Flaygl misdiagnosed me and I didnt need to be on it at all. Was probably just irratable bowel flare up and just eat high figer diet.I am so scared.If anyone has had numbness/burning sensations like me and have had any relief either over time or found something to take_ please email me.If you doctor recommends this drug_ try doxocycline instead.This drug so needs to be taken off the market.If there is some sort of lawsuit anyone knows of_ please let me know.It I stay like this I dont know what I am going to do:(So horrible.Please let us all come out of this.Thank you and god bless all of us.

1000, 5, severe sinusitis,After four months of sinusitis and three prescriptions of Azythromax a CT scan of my bleeding sinuses revealed they were completely blocked. My doctor said I would probably need a surgery but before that he wanted to try Levaquin. I asked him to prescribe cipro because it was the strongest poison I knew and I really wanted to kill the ugly germs. I guess I felt like people who have cancer and take chemotherapy because it is the lesser of the two evils. I started feeling better after three days. I was waiting for side effects but nothing bad happened. Towards the end I got stomach gas and then polyuria_ but I can't be sure what caused that because I was also on steroids and 180 mg of antihystamine Allegra per day.

1001, 1, prostate infection,After about the third dose of Cipro_ I had horrible muscle spasms in my back_ neck_ buttocks and legs.  The extreme pain got worse with each dose of Cipro. Disorientation_ confusion and incoherence followed after the last dose and the pain only became worse.  Now_ after about a week after stopping Cipro_ I can't walk. The tendons in my leg are extremely painful and I can barely stand without support and in spite of taking a course in prednizone_ the pain and the muscle spasms are still intense.  Will this ever go away? I was perfectly healthy prior to Cipro and loved to walk in the mountains.  Will I ever be able to do that anymore?  What can I do to make this go away?,This drug should and MUST be taken off the market so people won't get so very hurt by it.,M,72,4  days250mg 2X D,4/1/2010,Cipro
1002, 2, Prostatitis,Thanks to this website and all of your comments I have decided to NOT take Cipro.I wanted to add an educated guess about the cause of many of these symptoms.  Cipro binds with magnesium_ zinc_ iron and calcium possibly because of the fluoride content.  These minerals_ now combined with Cipro would be useless to the body.  Cipro may be causing multiple mineral deficiencies in patients who have preexisting low mineral levels.My suggestion is to use a chelated multi mineral supplement to help correct any deficiencies.  I would stay clear of aspartates (personal experience).  Do not use products containing magnesium oxide_ which is very difficult to absorb.I wish I had a recommendation about which brand to try.

1005, 1, Cellulitis infection in leg,First_ I'd like to point out that the drug had no effect whatsoever on the infection - I had to go to another full course of antibiotics to kill that off. I took this medication the first full week of January this year.Skin rash_ tendonitis in ankles_ kness and shoulders_ gout outbreak in 5 or 6 joints at once and depression for the first couple of weeks.  Since then_ skin rash has abated but I've still got problems with gout breakouts (and I am watching my diet so it's not because i'm misbehaving) and tendonitis - these things seem to come and go with no warning.  Also_ lacking energy and a general body ache.

Also I was walking back to the bed and began having dizziness_ nausea_ cold sweats and then began the worst faint I_ve ever had(I've fainted a few times before and this was very different.) I made it to the phone to call 911 but couldn't dial for the disorientation. I laid on the floor praying not to die_ holding the phone as I passed out. My husband rushed home to take me to the ER but we knew this was a medication reaction and we waited to see if I would get better.After half a day of bloody stools and just blood coming out- the bleeding stopped. I was very tired with chills for a few days and discomfort in my esophogus_stomach_ but especially my bowels. Thank God I only took that one pill! Praying not to have long term gastrointestinal damage.I can still feel discomfort in my bowels after a week.,Many people can take this medication without any side effects but if you have never taken it before_ like any medication it can be a killer or do long-term damage.

My regular MD did blood work and discovered that my ""muscle emzynes"" were sky high.  She would have given me a steriod but said that it would affect my blood sugar. So for about a month or so I just put up with the pain before it finally subsided. Here's the saddest thing of all......this happened 7 years ago.  If I stress my thigh muscles in any way (like exercise) my thighs hurt so bad_ and get so tight that  they cause me to feel ""unsteady"" on my feet.  I have to go down the steps backwards!

I don't think everyone would react like this_ just keep in mind that if you do feel pain/weakness in your limbs_ call your doctor immediately. It is not normal_ so my doctor told me to stop and will prescribe a different antibiotic.

1035, 3, UTI,Manic reaction_ insomnia_ headache.,I have my 3rd UTI in 4 months. My dr. put me on Cipro for 10 days. Today is only day 3. The first night I took the pill_ I couldn't fall asleep. I normally have a drink in the evenings_ but did not want to drink with the medication. I had a hard time falling asleep and thought it was due to not having a drink. However_ I woke up at 5 AM the next morning (2 hours earlier than normal)_ and couldn't fall back asleep. I was manic all morning_ doing laundry_ organizing things_ cooking_ doing homework_ etc. That night I felt very tired but could not fall asleep. I had a terrible headache that would not go away. I slept two hours from 11 to 1_ and then again from 4:30-6:30. I still feel manic_ and still have a headache. I am hoping this won't get worse.,F,21,10  days 2X D,2/26/2010,Cipro
1036, 1, UTI,I don't even know where to start with my anger towards Cipro. Seven years ago was the first time I took this and ever since have suffered from some tendonitis and joint inflammation throughout my body. I have had three surgeries to helped make it tolerable to walk. Although they helped the tendonitis it would just move somewhere else. Three weeks ago I was prescribed this for another UTI. Regrettable_ I didn't read all the fine print and assumed my doctor would have the sense to know the dangers of prescribing this drug for minor UTI. The second and third day I had a headache. After my 6th pill I could not walk. Of course_ I still thought it was this mysterious disease that no doctor in seven years could diagnose that caused my ankle to swell up and my entire leg to ache like it was pinned under a boulder. I googled cipro side effects to find out about my headache and well that just opened Pandora's Box. Everything I read was answers to my questions and problems for seven years. Unfort,I have found some relief drinking IONIX Supreme from Isagenix. I have spent thousands on trying to find solutions. If you haven't started your cipro prescription_ DON'T!

For me this has not gone away. I was a guy who was pretty tan in the spring and summer. Now my skin I get really bad rashes. Something about Cipro just makes your skin and eyes really sensitive to light....be warned_ it can be permanent. Even being in any amount of sunlight now hurts my eyes. I thought this would go away eventually at first_ but it hasn't. I really don't think I'm ever going to be able to just go out and sit in the sun again.

1040, 1, Prostatitis,1. Tendon pain in the knees and behind them.  Pains started after 4th tablet. Slight pains_ coming and going. I kept taking it_ since there was no warning that I had to stop and doctor told me that I worry too much about it(!). After I quit_ it became more severe in 2 weeks_ then gradually disappeared 1.5 months after discontinuation. I was fine for 1 month_ until I tried rollerblading. Pains came back and stay now with no improvement for 2 months. Barely walking. Muscle weakness. Still having them.2. Heart palpitations. Started on 8th day. Just brief episodes. Three weeks after discontinuation they suddenly became horrific_ violent and endless_ continued for another 3 weeks. 12500 per 24 hours! I worn heart monitoring device and visited emergency. I was in hell and thought that I am going to die soon...3. Insomnia_ inability to concentrate_ severe anxiety_ panic attacks. Almost resolved by now. Had them for 3 months after discontinuation.4. Hypothyroidism. Got cured on it,It's a fluorine positioning.Like with many of you_ doctors were fooling around with me_ convincing me that it can not be from Cipro!ITS A MAFIA! They all instructed to say the same thing!When I complained after 1st episode of tendon pain_ doc told me that it can't be from Cipro - he said that he gave it to hundreds of people and no one complained! The horrible leg pain_ which started during the antibiotic course and lasting for months no way can be from Cipro. How childish it sounds... I saw 4 doctors and the first thing they do  they looks for other reasons_ like rheumatoid arthritis or some kind of coincidence!The state of US health care is outrageous... Who are these people??? Kaiser Permanente poisoned me. They didnt even do the test to see if I have an infectionI don't understand why I need a medical insurance. So that doctors would kill me???No more trust!I had to figure out myself_ that I had fluorine positioning as many of you.There are some remedies_ how to remove the fluorine from your body: http://www.naturalnews.com/026605_fluoride_fluorides_detox.htmlThe bad thing  fluorine can stay in your body for a long time and keep poisoning you.This medication is very DANGEROUS. 1) Side effects come or intensify_ even after discontinuation. 2) Doctors refuse to associate it with cipro and do a proper treatment. 3) Side effects are very long term and unpredictable. 4) NO adequate warnings regarding tendon pa,M,36, 500 1X D,2/24/2010EmailHistory,Cipro

I almost passed out while driving_ thinking I was having as stroke or heart attack. One ambulance ride and multiple tests later reveal nothing. This was in Sept. 2009 and still only slightly better. Sleep seems to help the most. Doctors pretty much don't care or believe these symptoms are a result of Cipro. In my mind there is no other cause. Till now I have led a healthy life with no medical problems (other than the bladder infection - which I wish I had have dealt with the old fashion way).

I was not thinking this was related to the medicine so I kept taking it. Aat about the 6-7th day_ I started to feel some pain and stiffness in two areas: on my right foot at the middle toe 'knuckle' area_ but underneath.  This has come and gone since I have stopped taking the medicine about a month ago and appears to be abating now.  The worse pain has been in my right elbow - a tennis elbow sort of symptom.  This has not gone away and in some ways it has gotten worse in this period (perhaps because it is difficult to immobilize my right arm).  It has now gotten to the point where I am considering getting treatment for the tendonitis now.,Despite the above_ I generally liked the medicine as I have been on other types of antibiotics in the past and had all sorts of GI side effects - none of those were seen with this treatment.

1065, 3, UTI,Cipro along with Phenazo (pyridium) worked well when I had a severe bladder infection where I was practically dripping blood. I have had a hysterectomy a few years ago so I have not menstruated for years.,Cipro is a very harsh medication and was initially used to combat the Anthrax infection which killed people many years ago.For severe infections it works but the side effects and allergies to this medication are very high and most people are not able to tolerate it. Now I visit a naturopathic doctor and for UTI's I take UVA URSI which is a natural supplement consisting of the uva ursi leaf and it works great for UTI's and bladder problems. It can be purchased from the health food store. It has tannin in it and can be used ONLY MAXIMUM 5 TIMES PER YEAR. I mark down the date I start taking it and it can be taken for only 7 days - 2 capsules per day. One in the morning and one in the evening. At the onset of a UTI I take 2 right away and this has helped me immensely. Along with the uva ursi you must also take spring horsetail silica - also two per day. When the UTI has cleared up then if you are prone to frequent UTI's you should take the spring horsetail silica - one per day to keep the bladder healthy as this makes the bugs slippery in the bladder so they don't adhere and cause a UTI. Also the silica is great for skin_ hair and nails.,M,49,5  days,1/31/2010,Cipro

1073, 2, possible uti,ear ringing_ headache_ aches in knee/back/hip_ start of a fever_ starting to feel like developing a flu,250mg twice a day.  (only took two pills before I stopped) Took first pill at night and had (ear ringing/strange feeling)-that went away by the 2nd day.  Had a slight headache after taking it might have been from stress though.  When I woke up my body ached some and it seemed to affect my right knee_ back ..felt like I could pull a muscle or strain it easily.  (Basically it mostly affected areas where I've put strain on in the past and are more prone to wear out from overworking them)..however I haven't been overworking them it was the result of cipro.  Then took my 2nd pill in the morning.  Started to feel flu like symptoms by the end of the day and took my temperature (developing a fever).  I called the pharmacist and recommended not to take anymore and to talk to my doctor.  She said most people do not have these reactions.  I don't know if that's true.  But I recommend to pay attention to the warning.  There are some common reactions like nausea headache etc that are suppose to be more common.  But there is a list of things that warns you if you have them to stop taking it.  And flu like/fever is definitely one of those.  As of now my body aches_ feels like the flu and slight fever.  I am going to avoid doing physical activity until I start to feel like my body is recovering.   And am just laying around in bed_ not lifting heavy objects etc bc when you have this reaction (achy muscles/straining) its easy to pull something.,F,29,1  days,1/21/2010,Cipro

Really_ I suppose I'm atypical maybe but this stuff worked amazingly for me_ I'm halfway through treatment and symptoms have all disappeared down to my normal levels of sneezing and blowing my nose all the time because this place is full of allergens. As an added benefit_ if I had any other bacteria floating about in me I'm sure its quite dead too. Floxin type drugs are not to be used constantly though_ so as to not make resistant bacteria.,M,23,5  days,1/20/2010,Cipro

I went to Target to shop and felt really tired and this is after resting for the last couple of days. It was hard to lift the big laundry detergent bottle.,I think this is a great antibiotic and has cleared my infection.  I think it may be too strong for a simple UTI and I wonder why it was prescribed to me.  I guess because I may be allergic to Sulfa drugs.  I think it should be saved for Anthrax.  Other than the fatigue_ I have had no other bad side effects though.  I find the fatigue rather odd.,F,43,5  days,1/18/2010Email,Cipro

1081, 1, Kidney infection,Yes_ The Cipro appears to be clearing up my Kidney Infection. With it came many side effects. The first day I took it I got very sharp pains in my lower abdomen that were so bad I curled up in a ball on the floor for a half hour. I have never felt pain that bad before. When the pain subsided I got up and walked to the kitchen and instantly got light headed. Instead of getting a drink_ I ended up heading for the couch. On my way there I literally felt drunk... I couldn't walk straight and everything was starting to go black. Just as I got to the couch my lower lip got extremely tingly and I blacked out. Days 2_ 3_ and 4 I had pain in my hands_ arms_ legs_ feet_ and hips. I had chest pain and was short of breath. My mind was in a fog. I couldn't think_ couldn't concentrate. Headache. I felt depressed. Day 5 I had that sharp pain in my lower abdomen again.. This time I was curled up on the couch for an hour before it got better. I literally thought I was dying.,I've been doing some research online for home remedies. I came across one that said to take a shot of Apple Cider Vinegar 3 times a day. They claim that it's good for getting rid of Bladder and Kidney infections. So I started this yesterday...Not only could this be helping my infection_ But all my side effects seem to have up and disappeared. LOL...

1101, 3, UTI/kidney infection,brain fog_ horrible headache_ abdominal pain_ dizziness_ extreme tiredness_ extreme depression and feelings of hopelessness,I'm a kidney transplant patient and have taken cipro on and off for years.  I've probably had it 4 times this year alone_ and this is the 2nd time with horrible side effects...so bad that I thought my kidney was rejecting. It is only because of the holidays and hospital beds being full that I'm not hospitalized.  A friend researched side effects and told me about the tendonitis associated with Cipro and transplant patients.  I then started researching and found this site.  These symptoms are right on. I don't know why I'm impacted differently now. I was supposed to be on it for 4 mo_ but quit last night after seeing this site (12 days).   Already my headache is better_ and I'm hoping to see the other side effects disappear as well. When I first started this_ I spent 3 days in California.  I was in such a fog I barely remember the trip. It seems more like a dream than an actual event.I might try it again_ as it does eliminate the infecion_ but would definitely stop at the first sign of symptoms. Levaquin has also worked for me_ but insurance doesn't want to pay for that anymore.  Not sure how the public option will impact our choices of antibiotics_ or we'll all be paranoid schizophrenics from being on these meds :-)Also read Cipro was shipped en masse to the Gulf War and our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. If it has anywhere near these side effects_ I imagine it is creating all sorts of havoc with paranoid soldiers with guns. Scary thought.,F,57,12  days,12/28/2009Email,Cipro

I took the entire prescription_ but will NEVER take this again- the only reason I finished the entire course was because I was afraid of what other antibiotic I would get prescribed.  I started getting syptoms day 1 about 6 hours after I took the first dose.  The dizziness was horrible and would come in waves.  The whole room would spin for about 20 seconds every few hours.  I would get nauseous and this_ coupled wit the dizziness_  made it difficult to work and to pretty much do anything else because I never knew when another dizzy spell would hit me.  I felt ""out of it"" and was having terrible back aches and migraines.  I'm a normal_ healthy 28 yr old and have never had any of these issues before so I know they were related to taking the Cipro.  I would never take this again.  I took my last does this morning and still don't feel back to myself.  I'm hoping as it gradually leaves my body I will begin to feel like myself again.  I felt like the Cipro was poisoning me...

I've been taking it for about three days_ and when i don't take it immediately after waking up_ my symptoms of the UTI come back even worse than before_ leading me to believe this medicine is doing nothing.

I'm constantly tired on it_ insecure_ completely paranoid_ horribly depressed_ with mood swings that make me feel like some sort of caricature of bipolar disorder.  What's even worse is that I had to reschedule a MAJOR exam because after I take this_ I don't even fell well enough to walk and can barely manage to read or write a coherent sentence for almost two hours!  After reading these reviews_ and realizing that some people have these permanently_ I'm going back to my doctor and demanding a new prescription_ and reporting this drug to the FDA.

PRAYING TO THE LORD FOR TOTAL RECOVERY AND HEALING FROM ALL THIS_  i must say it feels like a blessing just to find this page_ because even though i feel better than i did_ i was just wondering WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THIS MESS ALL ABOUT?!!!....MY PRAYERS GO OUT TO ALL OF YALL OUT THERE GOD BLESS YALL,M,32,2  weeks,12/9/2009Email,Cipro
1117, 1, UTI,Depression_ thoughts of suicide.,Wow_ now that I see the other comments I'm amazed anyone is prescribing this drug. Of course_ if anyone is_ I'm not surprised my doctor is. She's pretty much in big pharm's back pocket.,F,44,3  days,12/8/2009,Cipro
1118, 1, post-surgery infection prevention,severe back pain_ knee pain_ mild ankle pain_ headache,I'm an extremely healthy young guy and prior to taking Cipro I had never experienced back pain or knee pain.  My back would hurt when I laid down at night to sleep.  It seemed to intensify as I relaxed_ and tensing up seemed to slightly ease the pain.  When I woke up in the morning_ I felt fine though and it didn't hurt standing up during the day really.  Luckily after I stopped taking the drug the back pain got 90% better.  Knee pain kicks in primarily in the mornings when I'm driving to work and has also improved (but not gone away) since I stopped taking the drug.  However_ I have had a headache now for at least 5 days!  I've never had a headache for this long.  I can't think what else it could be related to.  Ibuprofen helps_ and luckily the headache isn't too intense_ but the fact that it's not going away is scaring me.  Will be seeing a rheumatologist and possibly a headache specialist soon.,M,24,7  days,12/7/2009,Cipro
1119, 1, suspected kidney infection,nausea_headaches_dizziness_paranoia_EXTREME anxiety of the EXTREMEST kind_panic attacks_ shortness of breath_ difficulty breathing_ heart racing_ etc... the list goes on,It is now 2 weeks since I took my last CIPRO. I have taken them 4 times before over the last 3 years thanks to my GP who refuses even now to admit that there are any serious side effects.I am in England in the UK and not the USA like many posters here.Unless you have taken CIPRO then you can never_never understand what they do to you and your body and mind. I have been to hell and come face to face with the DEVIL himself thanks to my GP and the pharmaceutical companies and Government policies.If you read this before taking a pill then please stop right now and throw them away because any infection is far better than what you will go through.If I had to make a choice right now between a CIPRO and an injection of heroin off the streets then I would opt for the heroin without any doubt or faltering in making the correct choice.These drugs are worse than any street drug that a scumbag drug dealer peddles in dark alleyways.I am taking each day at a time now and thanks to God have now stopped having the horrible negative thoughts that have overwhelmed my life for the last 14 days.I still cant go upstairs without getting out of breath or having aching bones_ but thanks to a good friend have started a de-tox and i pray to the good Lord that in time i may be normal again.DO NOT TAKE CIPRO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES..PLEASE DONT.I CANT REALLY SAY ANY MORE,M,31,3  days,12/5/2009,Cipro
1120, 1, Possible UTI,"Pains in legs_ feet_ fingers_ toes_ wrist...can barely walk. I feel like I am burning up every night_ a ""hot"" feeling. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!",I am so scared_ I took for a suspected UTI_ 2 pills a day for 7 days. The pain and fear is so bad I've already contemplated suicide. I'm 25 ears old_ how can this happen! I've had to withdraw from school_when the semester was almost over_ and was suppose to be job hunting. Now I don't know if I will ever be able to resume college or work again since reading others horror stories. This pain may really not go away for weeks_ months_ years even?! It's been over a week since discontinuing.I never even wanted to take this to begin with_ because I had a urinalysis come back NEGATIVE after taking a different antibiotic.A urologist said it was possible I still had an infection_ which sounded like BS to me. I checked with my regular physician who said it was indeed possible to have a negative result but still have an infection.  I had no symptoms of infection other than kidney pain. My family urged me to take this_ and now I'm am filled with guilt for not following my gut instinct on this_ like this is my own damn fault.I discontinued what should have been a 10 day treatment after 7 days_ and went to the ER. Still not properly diagnosed,F,25,7  days,12/4/2009,Cipro
1121, 3, UTI/Kidney Infection,Continued pain in my right kidney_ shooting pain in my left arm_ pain in my toes_ overall pain in my stomach_ left kidney_ weight loss_ depression_ anxiety_ morbid thoughts_ lethargy_ sleep disturbance,I had a UTI that lead to a kidney infection.  My doctor prescribed a 7 day course of Ciprofloxacin which I dutifully took.  It cleared my kidney infection_ however_ I still continued to have pain the right kidney.  I tried to go back to work_ experienced acute pain.  Since then I have started to have all the pain noted as side effects and it continues.  It wasn't until I stumbled across this last night that I actually began to think that it is the Cipro.  I have now been off work for nearly two months.  I am a shadow of my former self.  I don't have energy to do anything. I'm a single mum and struggle to care for my two young children. God knows what I would have done if I hadn't had a loving family around me.  I go to bed at 8pm every night_ and wake up every morning feeling worse. I'm probably going to lose my job_ which I loved_ because I just can't work. I had a ultrasound scan yesterday that came back as clear which has made me feel like I am going mad and all this is in my head.  If this is true_ I cannot believe that we can be prescribed a drug that can cause more harm that the original illness for which it was intended.  Please email me with comments.  I've been prescribed a further 5 weeks course of this product and I stopped taking it last night when I read all your comments.  Whoever started this thread_ I thank you so much.,F,40,42  days,12/3/2009Email,Cipro

Not sure if this was the direct cause_ but I doubt the infection did this.,Many drugs (artificial chemicals) have severe adverse effects_ some permanant.  I personally prefer Eastern holistic medical approaches over the more profit oriented Western approach (which often leaves hapless victims in it's wake).

1126, 1, UTI,I took Cipro 2 months ago for a possible UTI.  I immediately became very ill with abdominal pain_ exhaustion_ body aches_ pain in my extremities.  When I went to the doctor she suggested I probably did not drink enough water so when my urinary problems returned 2 months later the doctor recommended Cipro.  After the 3rd day the same symptoms appeared even though I was drinking enough to drown myself.  I stopped after 3 1/2 days but I still have the aforementioned symptoms and backaches as well.  I will never take this drug again and after reading some of these accounts i am afraid I may have long term effects. P.S.  I didn't even have a UTI.,,F,61,4  days,11/29/2009,Cipro

1128, 1, UTI,Cipro ruined my life.  I don't wake up until 3pm most days now because I have no life to wake up to.  I dread every day.  I can barely walk_ barely bathe myself_ barely even type this message right now.,"Two months ago I was healthy_ active and independent.  I don't know if I'll ever be that person again_ thanks to six days on Cipro.  The biggest mistake of my entire life.  How can these things be allowed to happen?  Where is our protection?  I don't fit any of the ""risk"" factors for developing side effects: I'm nowhere near 65_ never had a transplant_ no steroid use...but here I lay crippled and wondering what the hell is going to come of my life now.  Those poisonous pills have attacked just about every part of my body--and severely so.  No longer able to care or provide for myself_ I struggle every day with thoughts of suicide.  I am now a 30-year-old trapped inside a 200-year-old body and every day I want out.  This was not the way my life was supposed to end up.  IT'S NOT WORTH IT_ PEOPLE.  TAKE SOMETHING ELSE.  I hope this message finds you before_ not after_ you've ingested your doctor-prescribed poison pills.  If you've already taken them_ drop to your knees while you still can and pray to God that you're one of the lucky ones.  And never take another quin drug as long as you live or else you're truly asking for trouble--repeat exposure to quin drugs seems to be a big factor in becoming floxed.  Also_ I'd advise NEVER to take a quin drug unless you know FOR CERTAIN that you indeed have a bacterial infection.  If not_ the poison will turn on you and attack your own tendons_ muscles and tissues.  That is my warning to you.  One f*cked up life is enough!",M,30,6  days,11/28/2009Email,Cipro

1133, 1, Suspected bladder infection,Side effects in the order they appeared after taking Cipro for 3 days (500mg twice a day): Aches and pains in my arms_ sudden very sharp pains in heels_ freezing yet clammy feet_ buzzing feeling in feet_ weak ankles_ shooting pains in feet ankles and calf muscles_ cold sweats at night_ waking up in the night with numbness in fingers_ sharp pin prick pains in chest and jaw_ tightness in chest_ very thick sticky sweat on face and hands_ pain in heels and arches of feet when standing (later diagnosed by GP as plantar fasciitis)_ freezing hands_ prominent veins appearing in arms_hands and legs......,"I had already taken Amoxycillin for 7 days_ Keflex for 6 days with only temporary relief from what seemed to be a bladder infection. I ended up in hospital with excruciating lower abdominal pain. All tests were negative for bacterial infection_ but they still put on cipro.They'd also given me morphine and a muscle relaxant intravenously_ followed by the cipro 4 hours later_ along with a cocktail of pain killers_ (dihydrocodeine_ tramadol_ some sort of ant-sickness tablet) and they wanted to give me ibuprofen_ but I happened to refuse that one on the grounds that I'm asthmatic. I didn't read the leaflet accompanying the cipro tablets until day 3 of treatment_ which mentions not to take it with muscle relaxants_ ibuprofen and many other drugs!! I do not know if Cipro alone caused my side effects_ or the cocktail of drugs they pumped me with_ but the most upsetting thing for me is that there was no sign of bacteria (or anything else for that matter) in my urine or blood samples_ so I don't understand why they treated me with such a toxic drug.I was sent home with a 10 day supply of Cipro_ but stopped taking it the following day when the foot pain started.My GP said I should stop reading about side effects and that she'd NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE HAVING SIDE-EFFECTS to this drug. I went back a couple of days later in worse pain_ and at this point the GP said ""Well_ the PEOPLE WHO I HAVE SEEN WHO HAVE HAD SIDE EFFECTS TO THIS DRUG have gone one to recover_ eventually""",M,34,3  days,11/25/2009Email,Cipro
1134, 1, Suspected bladder infection,See my previous post,Continuing my previous post:The doctor who put me on cipro REFUSED TO SPEAK TO ME_ and the message relayed to me was to speak to my GP and that side-effects are VERY RARE!! My only option was self help. I embarked on a detox diet_ eating fresh fruit and veg_ taking probiotics_ drinking nettle tea_ and avoiding flouridated toothpaste_ drinking lots of water_ and taking a biochemic tissue salt (Mag.Phos.) which is anti-spasmodic. I got myself a small wooden foot roller to help stretch the tendons in my heels. It's now been excatly one month since the side effects started and I can tell you that the pain_ cold clamminess and buzzing in my feet has almost gone. The leg weakness has mostly gone. I no longer have the sweaty face and hands. I do still have pains and numbness in my arms and hands_ which occurs every other day or so_ depending on what I've been doing. My feet ache after standing/walking for more than 15 mins_ but that's nothing compared to the pain I had before. Good luck to all of you who have had horrible side-effects from this drug_ or from interactions with other drugs. My only advice is to try detoxing your system.And people who have taken this drug and had no side-effects should count themselves very lucky. There is no need for them to belittle the terrible effects it has had on other people less tolerant to flouride poisoning!,M,34,3  days,11/25/2009Email,Cipro
1135, 2, Kidney infection/UTI,Extreme fatigue_ dizzy_ lightheaded_ feeling of being somewhat off balance_ feeling like ears are stopped up_ nausea_ weird dreams_ not sleeping well_ joint/muscle aches.,"I have taken this drug before and not had any problems.  My symptoms I was having relating to the kidney infection seem to be better_ but this time around the extreme tiredness is just awful. Today is the 7th day I have been taking 500 mg. every 12 hrs. and I am now having other symptoms which are worse than before I went to the Dr. I started worrying about it after really pushing myself yesterday to get through the days work and then this morning_ I went back to bed after feeling totally wiped out after being up only a couple of hours.  Also_ having weird dreams and just feel blah and ""weird"".  This had me thinking maybe I was misdiagnosed and had something else going on_ then I decided to research the side effects a little further.  I found this site and from reading the other posts on here_ it seems I am having pretty much the same type of symptoms as others have stated.  So this time around_ the Cipro seems to work as far as clearing up the infection but the side effects from this med are worse than the symptoms I was having from the infection.  Assuming it is in fact side effects from the med that is causing all this for me.  I will call my doctor and see what she says.",F,46,7  days,11/24/2009Email,Cipro
1136, 1, Prostatits,Autoimmune vascular neuropathy.  Tendon destruction.,It's been at least a year since I've last taken Cipro.  Like the product insert says_ severe_ irreversible neuropathy is among the possible side effects.  Just imagine burning_ temperature-induced pain in all of your extremities.      The research I've read on Fluoroquinolone toxicity_ describes an autoimmune_ Raynaud's-like_ vascular condition that chokes off blood to peripheral nerves-- hence irreversible nerve damage and occasionally_ severe pain.  Damage to tendons may follow a similar pathogenesis.My self-experimentation with vasodilatory substances_ including Niacin (flushing type)_ Ginkgo_ and topical Rogaine_ have effectively brought this disease-- yes_ this is a disease despite what doctors may imply-- to tolerable levels.  It is still extremely inconvenient_ however_ as it is not my only underlying health condition!The lack of post-market research into fluoroquinolone side effects means that there is little your doctor can do to recognize or treat this condition.  Steroids have been proposed as a treatment to many-- but with existing tendon damage this is kind of a bad idea.For the legal sake of this excellent website_ I am not a doctor_ and these statements have not been evaluated by any governmental medical body.,M,31,3  days,11/24/2009Email,Cipro

You are a very lucky person and should really count your blessings. My life has been a living hell from this drug. I took it for a kidney infection in 9/08 it worked great for me. My infection returned again in 10/08 so my doctor prescriped it again and thats when my nightmare began. It has been over a year and things are better but I have nerve damage in my shoulder and in constant pain. My ears ring all day long. I only sleep 3 hours a night. Why would all the people posting make this up. I have nothing to gain from this because I can't do anything about it legally because it has a black box warning on it.

Regardless of these side effects_ I'd certainly use Cipro again if needed and recommend it to others.,I read this site the first night I began the medicine and freaked out and called my OB/GYN (I had gotten the Cipro from a Urgent Care). I asked my doctor about the side effects and what they normally recommend_ and they said they use Cipro all the time and that they've never heard of any of the side effects mentioned on this site (not to say those who posted them are making things up).

I will be getting off these drugs 12/13 and am counting the days.  Don't like to talk about almost losing my life to microbes but am grateful for an outstanding ID doctor and these meds.  I don't let myself thing too much about the (thank god) minor side effects.  Its scary to think about our future where these medicines will become ineffective due to overuse.  I had no choice to poison my body for so long but can tell you I would never take cipro for a sore throat or other minor ailment where there are alternatives.I had strong joint pain early on that has become less of an issue.

There are literally THOUSANDS of victims out there of all ages (floxy's) who were perfectly healthy_ active individuals before they took Cipro.  Now they form internet groups trying to console one another and figure out WTF has been done to their bodies and lives.  DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT_ PEOPLE!  Report your horror stories to the FDA_ eventually they can no longer turn a deaf ear to the havoc this drug is causing.  This poison must be pulled off the market before it floxes one more unsuspecting individual_ and it's long overdue for Bayer to have its ASS SUED OFF.  I'll be there in a wheelchair if I must!

I'm taking calcium and magnesium supplements as well as glucosamine and MSM_ drinking lots of water_ vitamin C_ probiotics_ fish oil...NOTHING is stopping this from wreaking havoc on my body more and more each day.  I have literally aged 100 years in two f*cking weeks.  When is this going to stop!?  IS THERE ANY HOPE?,M,30,6  days,11/7/2009Email,Cipro
1156, 1, prostatitis,Took one pill in July -Joints are still sore.,Here is some feedback on the side effects of Cipro. My joints continue to improve though my dosage was smaller then others I read about.I always stayed on my feet with very mild walking. Also walk down stairs backwards so it doesn't stretch the achilles tendon out. I have made bone broth which gives your body protein to rebuild tendons. Ice massage works well too. Stay away from aspirin and Ibuprofin as they restrict blood flow to the joints. Brocchli is a natural anti-inflammatory. I also stretch to keep things limber. Any questions please e-mail me.,M,46,1  days,11/6/2009Email,Cipro
1157, 1, Epididimititus,Took full prescribed course(14 days 2 x 500mg a day)After day 4 went back to GP to query Aching ankles_leg_arm_& back muscles_Shooting Headaches_Nausea_Night sweats_and general lack of energy...,On second visit to GP after explaining previous side effects was instucted to continue with course and was prescribed with Pain Killers...Three weeks later and side effects still persist_have had blood test and results show slightly raised white blood cell count_I am hoping this is due to CIPRO as I am really worried it is something more serious!!!Have to get second lot of blood tests tomorrow then if count is the same GP will be referring me to a specialist.I have shown some ofthe comments to my GP an he was unaware of the risks(Am well sickened we dont have the same black box warning in UK) If anyone has any advice please email me,M,48,14  days,11/5/2009Email,Cipro
1158, 1, ear infection,numbness in legs and arms_ headaches_ dizzyness_ shakiness_ sweaty palms_ knee pain_ thigh pain_ neck pain_ shoulder pain_ insomnia_ fatigue_ blurred vision_ throbbing veins_ diarrhea,I'm still trying to decide if i'm goign to go back to the doctor.  From what I'm reading_ its probably no use.  The first day i felt side effects was the day after finished taking the drug.  It felt like i was having a stroke_ half of my body was numb.  From there my arms and legs were constantly numb and i couldn't sleep and i was constantly alternating between headaches and dizzyness.  After reading boards like this_ i started taking a probiotic and a omega-3 pill.  The probiotic was to help rebuild the positive cells i'm sure Cipro killed and has helped with the diarrhea.  The omega-3 oil has helped reduce the numbness.  I don't know what's going to help stop the shaking or dizzyness/blurred vision/sweaty palms i'm still dealing with.  If you have a clue on how to get this awful drug completely out of my system_ please email me.  BTW_ its been about a month since i stopped taking the drug and I've just been able to get back into my gym routine.  I was perfectly healthy before the ear infection and worked out about 4-5 times a week on average.,M,24,10  days,11/5/2009Email,Cipro
1159, 1, possible uti,See comments,This is a request to anyone who has made progress in recovering from these quinolones. LET US KNOW ABOUT IT!!! We sure could use the hope that maybe we_ too_ will get better. So if you have overcome a neuropathy or a muscle/joint pain issue_ (even to a degree) dont just leave the board. Tell us.

1160, 1, UTI,6 months out and I still have foot_ ankle and knee pain and some neuropathy in my feet.  I had 4 months of utter hell following 5 250mg doses of this drug.  Damage to my vision and several tendons/joint is long term.,You would be well advised not to take this drug unless you hve no other choice (e.g._ you will die or have lifelong problems due to the infection).  Beware of other similar antibiotics.  The Dr. refered to Levaquin as a more mild anitbiotic.  It will do the same things to you.If you took this and had no problems_ a warning for you: everyone has a limit to how much lifetime exposure to flouroquinolines they can take before these horrible events start to occur.  Once they occur_ there is no going back.  Injurys to soft tissues like tendons are very stubborn and even worse_ the drug changes your body's ability to heal the damage it created.  IT IS NOT A SAFE DRUG.,M,42,3  days,11/3/2009Email,Cipro
1161, 1, epididimitis,ankle and knee pain_ numbness in hands and feet_ burning in wrists and back of leg_ headaches,Although I was aware of the potential adverse effects of Cipro_ I decided to take the drug because I have never had any form of reaction to medication. This is a decision that I am now regreting because I have been experiencing the listed adverse effects since I stopped taking Cipro over three weeks ago. With time_ I hope to make a full recovery but I consider this experience to be an important life lesson. 1. Do not take any medication unless you absolutely have to. 2. If you need to take a drug that has potential serious side effects_ always research to see if their is an alternative that is safer. 3. Stop taking a medication immediately if you experience any side effects!,M,32,5  days,11/1/2009,Cipro

Turned out to be bad shoes.,To everyone complaining about the doctor not telling you about the effects_ read the stuff that the pharmacy gives you; look on the internet; follow the instructions of what you should avoid while taking it. I see mention of people taking ibuprofen and such. The drug info clearly states to not take NSAIDs with it_ or take with dairy_ or have too much caffeine_ etc. I get that side effects occur_ but how many mentioned on this site are self-inflicted or caused by something other than the medicine?,F,42,20  days,10/31/2009,Cipro

It really sucks. And I don't feel any better. At all. The bad thing is I didn't even get a chance to talk to the doctor about what I felt was truly going on. I went to the restroom came back and he was gone_ he had my prescription written out and gave to another worker in the office to give to me.,F,22,5  days,10/31/2009Email,Cipro
1165, 1, prostatitis,tinnitis; stinging/shooting pain sensations all over body on skin; headache_ total loss of appetite_ nausea_ very sore achilles tendons_ popping shoulder_ knee_ wrist joints; throat felt 'thick' (not sore_ but uncomfortable; almost like it was slightly swollen); definite increase in 'eye floaters'; stinging tongue that gets coated much more quickly then it did previously (possibly changes to my saliva glands?) lots of anxiety (but whether that is due to the side effects or the med itself_ I don't know - not that it matters).,6 weeks after taking the cipro - I've still been experiencing the 'thick' throat feeling_ occasional neuropathy_ loss of appetite/ nausea.  It has now been over 6 weeks since I took two ciprofloxacin tablets (total 1 gram of drug).  I am so glad I stopped taking it immediately (started having bad headaches and ringing ears after the first day of use).  I've had a much better day today and yesterday_ however - possibly due to my increasing my calcium levels (drinking more milk; eating 'tums' as calcium supplements - not sure what the science to this is_ but if there was fluoride in my body causing these problems_ i know that calcium binds to fluoride and perhaps inactivates it.  the neuropathy has largely abated for now; that ridiculous 'thick throat' feeling has gotten *mostly* better as well.  still recovering in the appetite department.  For the first time yesterday and today I am feeling like my old self again.  I will keep up the calcium supplements for the next few weeks.  I definitely wouldn't be taking calcium if I didn't think it was helping_ as I have a propensity to form calcium kidney stones.  But I'd rather have the threat of a stone than the crap I've been dealing with for six weeks on the ciprofloxacin.,M,26,2  days,10/30/2009Email,Cipro

1167, 1, Infection,I took Cipro for 7 days (twice a day @ 500mg).  Everything seemed fine while taking it_ other than it gave me a yeast infection.  Well here I am two weeks after I finished my course_ and suddenly my achillies tendons and ankles are absolutely KILLING ME.  I'm very scared because I wasn't aware of the horrible side effects this drug can cause (or how common they are) until after I'd already taken it.  I've laid in bed for the past three days because I can hardly walk.  If anyone has any advice PLEASE EMAIL ME!  I'm so scared that I'm going to end up with a rupture or that this pain will last forever (as many people on here claim).  I can't believe my doctor gave me this SH!T and the only side effect he mentioned to me was sun sensitivity!  Sun sensitivity...and here I am barely able to walk.,Again_ please email me if you have any advice or ideas as to how I can minimize/heal the pain in my achillies tendons and ankles.  I've never in my life had any problems with my feet or tendons.  I'd also like to hear from anyone who's had similar side effects from taking Cipro and your experience with it (did your pain go away over time_ etc?).

1169, 2, UTI/Kidney Infection,Nerve/muscle pain just above right knee that shoots down leg_ mild nausea and abdominal cramping in the beginning,I was prescribed 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. I'm currently on day 6 and am just now starting to see the more serious side effects spoken about on this site. The first few days I had mild nausea and abdominal cramping_ which I felt was normal for a new medication being introduced into my system. However_ since last night I've had this intermittent pain that shoots down my leg_ starting about mid thigh above my right knee. It is more painful when I'm on my feet_ but I can still feel soreness even when I'm sitting down. It's not terribly painful_ but when it starts to shoot down my leg_ it makes me pull in my breath. I'm going to my PCP this afternoon after work to see if my infection has cleared up and if I need to switch to a different antibiotic.,F,25,6  days,10/26/2009,Cipro
1170, 1, fever/diarrhea,Took 3 days several days later had left ankle pain and swelling_ and sore achilles tendon.  Went back to the doctor ankle the size of a grapefruit and starting to get soreness in my right foot.  Doc said cellulitis and prescribed Keflex.  Three days later went back in because my right foot was swelling badly although left foot swelling was down pain the same.  Now I'm on prednisone and wear compression hose and my right knee is swelling.  Docs are acting like they want to call it RA but after reading this I know it's from the Cipro.  I took it for three days and have been out of work three weeks and counting.,I just turned 46 but I am very healthy.  I build large barns and buildings all by myself for a living.  I am lucky to be able to feed the chickens now.  The compression hose work well for helping the achilles tendon_ without them it hurts continually with them on it is bearable.  Soaking in warm water with epsom salts gives temp relief on the pain in my feet.,M,46,3  days,10/25/2009,Cipro

I am a healthy & active 27 yr old that has never experienced any pain in my legs before taking this medicine. I did not take the medicine on the third day and called my doctor and pharmacist. I am now taking Bactrim with less serious side effects. It's been 4 days since I stopped taking Cipro and I am still in pain! Not too mention my entire body has started to making a ""popping"" noise whenever I move!",Do not take this medicine!!

""Here take a pill_ ok_ take a pain killer to counter the side effects of the pill I just gave you. Well_ lets just run you through a battery of expensive tests and give you another pill."" Honestly someone should regulate the doctors and their tests and HONESTLY tell you about all the side effects that you will encounter. All we ever want is an honest diagnosis- what do I got and how can I treat it without feeling like I am going to die by filling a prescription. Sure some bacterial infections can kill you_ but so can the medications they give you. I don't like feeling ill_ but I don't like that doctors seem to tell you_ ""inconclusive... I have no idea what you got_ but follow up with your primary doctor"". They actually print on discharge papers now: (Your condition does not appear serious at this time.

Taking 500 2x a day.,I got a staph infection from outpatient surgery. The infection was cultured and showed susceptible to Cipro and Keflex. Took 7 days of Keflex and then 10 of Cipro. Infection was almost gone_ but not quite and I am on another 10 days of Cipro. I think the stuff is great. Also took for a misdiagnosed UTI a few years ago and no side effects then either.

The last two mornings I have woken up in so much pain I have almost fainted.,It's disturbing how often this pill is prescribed. I had traveler's diarrhea.  There has to be something else out there for that. Watch for side effects when taking this drug.  When the pain first started I thought it was normal from working out but as it progressed_ it was obvious this is not from working out.

I'm very active and it was devastating to me.,Please try taking MSM to alleviate joint problems caused by this family of antibiotics. It seems to have helped reverse damage.

1192, 1, Prostatitis,While taking Cipro_ joint stiffness_ tingling in legs_ muscle cramping in legs and shoulders_ muscle twitching over entire body. 3 months after discontinuing Cipro treatment_ sudden acute onset of peripheral neuropathic symptoms_ including severe muscle twitching throughout body_ tingling and burning sensation in arms and legs_ severe muscle cramping and muscle weakness. Confirmed by two neurologists that Cipro is the most likely cause. Because of the activity of flourinated compounds used in Cipro_ side-effects can occur weeks to months after discontinuation of the drug.,It's been three months since discontinuing the Cipro. The side effects continue to progress. I just saw a second neurologist who also nodded when I said I was on Cipro a while back. I must now undergo the usual battery of tests to rule out ALS_ MS etc._ but the unofficial diagnosis from two neurological doctors is CIDP resulting from Cipro. I was put on Cipro without any blood tests to indicate that I had a bacterial infection. There was no result from the treatment_ which means it was unnecessary. Even if it had fixed my prostate inflammation_ I would not have taken Cipro if I'd known the side effects. The result of taking Cipro is that I am now likely stuck with an autoimmune disease which may last my entire life. At the very least_ I'll require regular steroid ingestion_ and possibly I will require immunotherapy to treat the symptoms. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION UNLESS YOU HAVE A LIFE-THREATENING BACTERIAL INFECTION!

Fearing testicular cancer_ I kept on with the cycle.  By day 4_ I lost feeling in my feet and hands and by day 8_ I started getting these feelings in my face.  After I completed the cycle_ I told my doctor that I still had those feelings_ along with the headaches and bad muscle cramping.  He said it would go away - it never did.  I just visited my neurologist and got a CAT Scan and MRI done for fear of MS or ALS.  Both tests came back negative and the neurologist stated that it had to be the meds.  He even consulted with a neurologist colleague who had a patient with the exact same symptoms and took 2 years to accurately diagnose!!  Cipro works for most folks_ but the second you get ANY side effects_ please_ please_ PLEASE stop!!!,M,36,14  days,9/19/2009,Cipro

I thought the cloudy head was from being on a bland diet but I was on the diet a week before taking the antibiotics and never felt like this.

1200, 1, Prostate Infection,I was prescribed 500 mg of Cipro twice a day for 14 days to cure what was thought to be a prostrate infection_ but which turned out to be a kidney stone.  I have never had any negative side effects from a drug before_ but Cipro is different.  It began with a screaming headache with occasional nausea and dizziness.  And then the muscle pains started.  At first it was in my quadriceps_ which felt tight and sore.  On the fourth day I woke up in the middle of the night because of a severe pain in my right shoulder.  On the fifth day my right arm was still sore_ but that night a severe pain in my left shoulder and bicep woke me up.  I called my doctor and told him that I was through taking Cipro.  I've been off of it for a week now_ but the pain in my arms will not stop.  It feels like a severe cramp that will not stop.  Sleeping makes it worse because I'm not moving around.,I stopped taking Cipro almost a week ago_ but the pain in my shoulders and arms will NOT go away.  It's 3 o'clock in the morning right now_ and I can't sleep because the pain is so bad.  The doctor prescribed Vicadin to help me deal with it_ but NOTHING gets rid of the pain.  The side effects from the Cipro is far worse than any pain I've experienced with the kidney stone_  I am a very healthy_ athletic 47 year old.  This kidney stone is the first time I have ever been sick_ and the side effects I'm experiencing from taking the Cipro are first I have experienced with any drug.   The JERKS who have posted to this website suggesting that this is some kind of joke or conspiracy need to go straight to HELL.  Cipro may work for a lot of people_ but the side effects I'm experiencing have ruined my life.  If you experience a headache or any of the other milder side effects commonly associated with this drug_ stop taking it immediately. I'm looking now for possible solutions or treatments to my muscle pains.  If I find something--anything-- that works_ I will post it here.  In the meantime_ I'm going to try all the other suggestions people have made starting with treating this as flouride poisoning_ and trying to detox with borax.,M,47,5  days,9/15/2009Email,Cipro

I have heard that Vancomycin is better_ but I don't know how readily available it is_ plus if one built up a resistence to vancomycin_ they would really be in trouble.Also_ I have been eating a hearty meal with each dose_ avoiding calcium.

And now_ after 5th day I am experiencing severe pain behind left knee_ muscle and joint pain in entire body_ ringing in left ear_ hands and feet tingling at night_ and nothing tastes right.I'm not even sure my UTI has cleared up 100%.  And to top it ALL off_ my insurance would only pay for 6 pills_ not 7 because it wasn't ""pre-approved""!!!  How do you ""pre-approve"" an infection?????

I could not figure out what was happening to me until I googled side effects of taking Cipro. This medicine will really mess up your body.  DO NOT TAKE IT. I have decided to use a home remedy for my UTI by taking apple cider vinegar with honey twice a day_ fresh ginger tea_ plenty of water_ and hot water and lemon every day.  I have healed myself of many minor illnesses at home by focusing on my healing and eating natural things.  CIPRO is a killer and is very toxic.,This is the WORST medication I have ever taken.  It makes you feel SICK and much worse than you did before taking the medicine. It is a feeling that you have been poisioned or drugged.  I am very disappointed that doctors would prescribe this medication to patients.  If they knew what people felt like after taking this DRUG_ they would be ashamed.

My usual routine at the gym was trashed.   LIft a weight?  Hah!  Interestingly_ some weeks after quitting the cipro_ I developed an eye infection and put in a drop of the newest antibiotic drops my eye doc gave me.

1290, 3, UTI,stomach aches_ yeast infection_ severe diahrrea (sexy_ i know)_ a tiny little rash on my abdomen that only shows when im out in the sun_ with prolonged use: hallucinations_ huge mood swings,ive been getting UTI's on a regular basis for the past 6 years.  honestly_ the only thing that prevents them is vitamin c and 8 glasses of water a day.  if dr's ever prescribe me cipro_ i've learned not to take it for more than 3 days and save the rest for next time.  it's true_ cipro kills ALL bacteria_ good or bad (hence the yeast infections) so make sure to eat TONS of yogurt or drink KEFIR (good stuff!).  i'll drink a bottle of KEFIR a day and the effects are not as harsh.  but if you can get away with taking any other kinds of pills_ do it!  dr's wont approve of ginko baoloba but treat cipro like candy.,F,24,3  days,4/23/2009,Cipro
1291, 1, diverticulitis,Ten days into a 14 day course of Cipro_ I developed severe pain in my shoulders_ wrists_ and thumbs. Sleeping on my side was impossible_ and sewing or cooking or even lifting a frying pan were amazingly painful.  I am a healthy old jock and having worked out at the gym for over thirty years_ I know what pain is normal or predictable for me.  This was way outside my experience of sports injuries_ and it really was/is debilitating.  I stopped taking Cipro_ and at first it seemed that the pain rapidly decreased; however_ it's now been over two weeks_ and I find that lifting the smallest weights or using the slightest incline on the treadmill causes the old pain to flare up and new pain_ such as knee pain that I've never had before_ to arise.  Advil helps_ but I'm not used to limiting my activities or living on medication_ and not knowing how long these side effects will last or if they will get worse (the medical literature says it is possible) is worrisome--this in addition to dealing wi,If you google the frequency of tendinitis or tendon rupture with Cipro and other antibiotics in this class_ you will read surveys which indicate that serious reactions are fairly rare_ that is_ one in something like 11_000 patients_ plus or minus a few thousand.  Those are not bad odds.  But people who have been harmed post more often at sites like askapatient than do people who have not had problems_ so naturally you will see a higher proportion of negative responses here.Even so_ I would recommend being very careful with Cipro.  It's important to read the patient information that comes with the drug_ where warnings about possible tendon damage are clearly laid out_ and noting that people like me_ over 60 and physically active_ or people who already know they have problems with their joints for other reasons_ are more likely to have a serious adverse reaction.  I suspect that some people are just more sensitive to medications in general_ and if you know that about yourself_ it would probably be a good idea to avoid Cipro and its cousins.I would not and could not take this drug again.,F,66,11  days,4/22/2009,Cipro

I have lost musle mass_ and can't sleep one my left side. This has been going on now since July 29th. 2008. There are now signs things are getting better. Don't take this drug. I took it for four days at 500mg. I am recieving shots in my shoulder and neck of anti inflams and cortosoids. This has been a awful experience. Medical people have NOT been helpful.

Unable to make a fist. Right wrist EXTREMELY  swollen and very hot. Pain walking_ actually causing limping.,It is two weeks today since I took the 3 pills. The doctor was COMPLETEly dismissive of blaming the cipro_ until he WITnessed the size of my wrist...he acted like I had been making it up before that.  Now I've got his attention.  Two courses of pred with no effect.  Hives break out in the pm. Benadry and claritin have helped.  Still experiencing migrating pain in joints_ but have not had a SEVERE attack like early on in shoulders and hand.  Counting this as improving. Perfect health before this_ athletic. Praying for all that are suffering from this drug. There is no treatment or cure_ just time and luck...every case is different. Take it only if your life depends on it.

Otherwise_ it worked well.,My daughter had to take Cipro as a last attempt to get rid of her kidney infection before hospitalizing her.

Hallucinations_ sensitivity to light_ spaciness_ complete forgetfulness (would forget where I was_ who I was_ where i was going_ drive miles and miles when I was supposed to be going to work_ forget where I worked)_ EXTREME nightmares. ALL of this lasted six months. It has been four years since I took this drug and sometimes when I have a glass of orange juice all the symptoms come rushing back_ it's weird. Complete intolerance to alcohol and caffeine that have lasted for years. Intolerance to Chlor-Trimeton? and many other medications that influence GABA for any reason. Anxiety_ Panic Attacks_ the list goes on and on. Wasn't there something else they could have given me? I almost think it would have been better to go with a sulfur based drug that was not quite as effective than give up six months of my life and live with these side effects years and years later! I used to laugh at people with anxiety thinking it was all in their hea,After I took this_ I completely lost my mind. I was a healthy_ 20-something professional whose life was destroyed after taking this drug. I went from having virtually no allergies or sensitivities to being light sensitive_ many allergies (some previous such as animals)_ cannot tolerate alcohol anymore (I believe this drug cross the Blood brain barrier and can have an effect on GABA)_ well_ I guess it's easier to list the things this drug did not screw up_ such as my liver and possibly my heart_ although I have started having panic attacks as the latest in a long line of years of symptoms all present after this drug.,F,32,2  weeks,3/31/2009,Cipro

I took it for the entire 10 days_ and had no problems back then.  He told me if my diverticulitis flared up again_ to start taking the other refill right away_ which I did.  It was a much different story this time.  I started feeling toxic about the 4th day into it_ and stopped it the next day on my own.  The least little bit of activity was overwhelming for me_ and I'm normally quite healthy.

I called my doctor Saturday morning to get the prescription changed to a different antibiotic and had to end the call because I needed to vomit. Now taking Keflex -- no problems.

I have done some very extensive research on Cipro and other fluoroquinolones (FQs). Part of our problem_ especially in the US_ is the fact that we're so quick to pop a pill for every thing that ails us.  Taking antibiotics for every little illness only causes bacteria to mutate and become more drug resistant_ thus making it that much harder to fight off.  Below is information I wish I had know:1.  Cipro_ Avelox_ Levaquin_ Maxaquin_ Noroxin and Tequin therapy is nothing more than flouride poisoning. It kill all bacteria_ both bad and GOOD.  Eat LOTS of probiotic yogurt to replace the good bacteria; good bacteria is absolutely essential to having a healthy GI tract and fighting infection NATURALLY.2.

In fact_ this is the only antibiotic I've taken that didn't cause major side effects. It's puzzling why this drug seems to cause so much trouble for some but not others. I wouldn't take this drug for a minor infection_ but if you truly do need it_ I would at least give it a try for a day or two to see how you will react.

I had taken this several times before with little reaction (some nausea_ excessive thirst_ and stomach cramps) but the most recent time I developed the skin reaction as well.,The rash appeared 2 or 3 days into taking the medication.  Cleared the UTI up quickly (which was resistant to Macrobid and I am allergic to sulfas) but the rash took over 2 weeks to clear up after stopping the medicine.  As it healed_ I would get stabbing sensations everywhere the rash was.  The sensation would be all over at random times and painful enough that I would yell out.,F,29,3  days,3/9/2009,Cipro

It may have helped to limit or prevent long-term damage due to this drug.  As soon as I felt severe hip pain I discontinued Cipro (after 3 - 500mg doses).   It has been almost a week since I have been off this drug and I still don't know how long these effects will last.  It sounds like_ if you experience muscle pain_ that is it important to ""listen to your pain"" rest the affected area and minimize use_ to prevent further and possible long-term damage.

I took the medication for 14 days thinking that my arm was sore because of something else and now two weeks after taking the medication - I still have the pains in my shoulder from time to time.

The next morning I woke up going to the bathroom constantly_ trying to urinate (pushing with all my might) getting very little_ dribbling results.

Fluoride builds up in your system over time and ruins your bones_ joints_ and muscles.,If you have chronic pain or tendonitis after taking this medication_ you will have to clear it out of your system.

It finally messed up my hands (I am a professional pianist) and today was the first time in over four months that I have felt like I might get over this eventually.,I took this for a UTI for a week_ then about a month later for two more weeks because the infection came back. About six weeks later I had two cortisone shots to the knee and a week later woke up one day with all my joints on fire. Every move I made resulted in pain all over my body. I have suffered for four months now.  The medical doctors won't cop to it being a CIPRO reaction (one has even suggested that I have rheumatoid arthritis)_ but my chiropractor_ acupuncturist and reiki therapist all believe that it is. They are the only relief I have gotten at all from this_ and I am experiencing it as a poison that I have to slowly let pass through my body.  I think in another month or two it will be totally gone.  I teach college_ but if I had been a blue-collar worker_ I would have been out of work four months ago.

Within days I could hardly walk due to tendonitis and muscle pain. For three months I could not walk farther than from room to room in my house. A month after the ear ringing started. Once the tendonitis was gone (about 3 months after it started) I was able to walk some_ then more_ until I can walk as far as I want_ but still feel pain in legs. Activity helped for me_ once the tendonitis was gone. Still ear ringing_ and head pain which seems to be from tendons in head (jaw). I saw many doctors all with may ideas but no solid fixes. I was formerly very fit_ able to hike 20 miles in mountains. I want to know if the ear ringing ever stops for anyone?,These are very powerful drugs and doctors readily give them out like lollie-pops. I recommend people seek out alternatives before risking the rest of their functional lives on it. The drug companies need to research the mechanisms of injury and seek ways to help.

An MRI of the left knee shows damage to the tendons and swelling of the bone marrow in the left knee. No arthritis was seen.  I use a walker now. I am going to an Orthopedic Dr._  Another Dr for pain management_ Rehab in warm pool_ and finally an Acupuncture Dr and drinking chinese herbs.  The Acupuncturist has helped me the most so far.The orthopedic Dr,I will never take this drug again and tell everyone I meet not to take it either.  Acupuncture is not covered by insurance and this is my first experience with this treatment and I hope it will continue to improve.,F,67,7  days,12/1/2008Email,Cipro
1383, 1, travelers diarrhea,nightmares_ paranoia_ anxiety_ depression_ tight chest_ increased heart rate_ achy joints_ dry eyes_ intercranial pressure_ tinnitus_ dizziness_ extreme fatigue,I took one dose of cipro_ and I feel like it is one of the worst mistakes I have ever made in my life. I never have nightmares_ and I actually typically enjoy my dreams because they are so pleasant. Within a 3 hour time period I had about 5 dreams in which I was unable to talk_ and woke up screaming. Eventually I sat in my bed for 2 hours_ fearful to get up_ and afraid to go back to sleep. Once I was able to get out of bed_ once the sun came up_ I had to leave my house because I was afraid to be inside. But I couldn't go far because I was afraid my house would catch on fire. Despite the fact that I knew the feelings I had were not real_ I could not fight them. I have never had any kind of psychotic episode before_ and typically have extremely low levels of anxiety and no depression.,F,22,1  days,12/1/2008,Cipro
1384, 1, UTI,ankle (achilles tendon) pain and stiffness_ leg pain,This is a continuation of the previous rating. Although in the past I never experienced symptoms_ this time I experienced lots of pain and stiffness in my ankles. I was extremely worried after reading the black box warning of the drug_ so I stopped taking it after the third dose and asked to be switch to a different antibiotic. Looks like I'll have to deal with the macrobid tearing up my stomach. But still would rather have stomach pain than damage that could last me the rest of my life. I hope there will be no lasting damage this time. Pain lessened after my last dose_ but 24 hours later I'm still a bit sore and stiff.,F,23,2  days,12/1/2008,Cipro
1385, 5, UTI,No side effects that I noticed,It seems like cipro has been put in a bad light here_ and just wanted to put my positive experience to let others know that it doesn't have negative effects on everyone. I have had UTIs since I was 4_ so believe me I have tried just about every antibiotic out there. Penicillin gave me hives_ Septra was the worst experience of my life (severe anxiety_ urinating every 5 minutes_ burning itching skin_ felt like I was going to die)_ and Macrobid works but with some stomach pain. But I have never had any problems with the cipro. And it always clears up the infection for me. Occasionally I will take macrobid too so that I don't build a dependance to cipro_ but I prefer the cipro any day. I have never taken it without food so not sure if it makes a difference on the stomach. But I always feel it's a good idea to take antobiotics with a meal. I get yeast infections after antibiotics though so this time I'm trying some acidolpholous pills during my treatment.,F,23,7  days,11/30/2008,Cipro
1386, 1, Kidney pain (possible bacteria),I went to the Dr and he said my urine looked clean_ but he couldn't explain the severe pain in my kidney_ but guessed it could be a build up of bacteria on the kidney. I had undiagnosed reflux in my right kidney as a child_ which destroyed the kidney. It is basically a mass of scar tissue_ sometimes it has function_ other times not. I started taking Cipro a few days ago and every time I took it I got so nauseous and my bones in my lower back hurt. Now I am exhausted_ my back is killing me_ my arms_ wrists_ and neck ache_ the sunlight burns my eyes and causes me to see black and red spots. I am severely nauseous_ and my kidney still hurts. I am stopping it today after reading all of this.,Nausea_ Diarrhea_ Severe Lower Back Pain_ Pain in All Joints_ Sunlight Burned Eyes_ Fatigue.

1387, 2, possible UTI,FATIGUE FATIGUE FATIGUE.,"I think I react badly to this particular class of antibiotics. I have taken Cipro before and had some fatigue but not like this. This time_ I slept for 4 hours in the middle of the day on the second day of taking Cipro. I have had UTI's before and usually do not feel so completely drained and in a state of brain fog as this. I also had trouble staying alert while driving to the grocery store.I have taken Levaquin in the past and the reaction to that drug was MUCH worse. When I took Levaquin_ I literally fell asleep at work in the middle of typing on the computer. The Cipro fatigue is more a sense of feeling weighted down or ""blah."" It does work to cure the UTI's but I am not sure if I can continue taking it through for the full 10 days. I am only on day 3 right now.I also have some odd twinges in my joints and that happened in the revious times I took Cipro as well.

The interaction of the Cipro with anti acids seems to be the only thing we can track back too.  I was in the hosptial for 11 days and 6 months off work.

Next time it was prescribed had besides pain_ severe mouth dryness_ nightmares_ floaters and pain in right foot.  The third time it was prescribed and the symptoms came back I looked up the drug and found the effects were related to Cipro and Levaquin so I didn't take more than one dose.,I had taken Cipro and/or Levaquin for sinus infections several times before with no ill effects.  Because of that I never associated the symptoms I was having to that drug.  I associated them with activity or other drugs.  It has been one year now.  I have pain and some swelling in my right foot.  I have pain in my upper arms if I stretch and floaters and discomfort in my left eye.  I am very careful about physical activity and am going to a trainer to slowly build up strength and range of motion.  I eat only organically grown meat and fish.  I have definately seen improvement and feel very lucky.  I have tried to make sure all my doctors and friends have the information I have found.  Altho' they sympathize with me_ one at least still prescribes it as he thinks it is such a good drug.,F,66,7  days,11/23/2008,Cipro
1393, 1, UT,After being on 500 mg of Cipro for 5 days_ it did not get rid of the UT.  A week later when the UT symptom were still there_ the dr. put me back on it for 10 days.  By day 6_ I was having severe burning and spasms in my UT and bladder.  Also_ pain behind my eyes_ vomiting_ tremors_ diarrea_ and achy all over.  When I stopped taking the Cipro_ the vomiting and diarrea stopped but the terrible pain and burning in my bladder continued.  I have been off of it for 10 days and I still have pain in my UT and bladder_ pain behind my eyes_ blurry vision_ and terrible aching in my joints.  Also_ extreme dry patches on my fingers and around cuticles.,I went to a urologist when my primary found that the infection had cleared up_ but I was still having extreme discomfort and pain in my bladder and UT.  The urologist said that my UT/bladder was still inflamed from the infection.  I have never had this happen before after at UT infection.  They did a CT scan _ but I doubt they will find anything.  After finding this website_ it explains why I feel so terrible.  I can't go with taking the Utira C to calm by bladder.  I am also living on Advil.  I can't sleep at night without it.  I feel like an 80 year old woman my joints hurt so bad.  My menstrual has also stopped.  I had a pregnancy test but am not pregnant.  I plan to go to a holistic doctor for detox.

On day 8_ (first day off Cipro) I had full blown hives over my torso (front and back)_ arms etc.  Terrible itching....hives were raised and blister red. Went to a walk-in clinic and was told it was reaction to cipro. Now am on a steroid to combact the allergic reaction to cipro. Today_ 2 days after being off cipro_ the rash has spread to my face and although the steroids are helping_ they are now making me jittery etc.  I have a known allergy to sulpha and told the physician this when he prescribed cipro. I now have listed in all my records that I am allergic to cipro. My worry now_ after reading this site_ is that the rash symptoms may not disappear?  I did have some stiffness when I started to walk in the morning.....never connected it to the cipro. That has disappeared and was never severe.,,F,61, ,11/17/2008,Cipro

Sore tongue_ mouth and throat - taking oral supplements that I have always tolerated brings on burning and soreness in the mouth/throat so that I have had to stop them. One week after taking the cipro out I had night sweats that lasted for 10 days. The tendonitis is still in full force 7 weeks later and no idea how long it will last.,I had no idea that so many others had these reactions - the adverse effects must be much higher than 1 in 10_000. I will be filing an adverse drug report to make sure the FDA include this in the statistics and would urge others to do the same. I have been very grateful for support from the Fluoroquinolone Antibiotic Victim Community (FAVC)group at http://noquinolones.proboards58.com/index.cgi.I will definitely never take a fluoroquinolone again and would advise anyone thinking of taking them to steer well clear and find an antibiotic that does not ruin your life.,M,36,3  days,11/17/2008,Cipro

I honestly never had any from this drug. With my uti's I had severe burning and pressure and within an hour or two of taking the first pill that was all gone. I LOVE this medicine.

I found it odd that the first time I took Cipro (which was about a year ago)_ I had hardly any side effects. But this time I am getting these side effects. Still_ my UTI symptoms are improving already. I no longer feel the constant urge to go or pain when I urinate. If it'll clear up this infection_ I can endure the side effects for 2 more days.,F,23,1  days,9/13/2008,Cipro
1428, 5, stomach upset_ urinary tract inf.,,I was prescribed Cipro before a 3 month trip abroad as a medicine that could cure me even if I was stuck in the middle of the jungle or on a mountaintop. Yep.I had to take it 3 times in 3 months_ which is not a good plan. Each time I got bad stomach illnesses_ waited a week to see improvement_ nothing happened_ I took it. Same thing with a UTI I tried to cure home remedy style.It cured the above problems in 24 hours or less practically with the first pill. Cipro will eventually become a weaker drug as more bacteria becomes resistant. Try to avoid taking as much as I did (I may ask for a more common antibiotic for my next trip for regular_ run of the mill infections) But right now_ if you are really ill_ Cipro is the drug to get those bad bugs out of you immediately.,F,21,10  days,9/12/2008,Cipro

I went to the ER and the doctor said it didn't sound like these were Cipro symptoms - most likely just stress. The racing heart has stopped but now I'm getting dizzy and a light head and numbness in my hands and arms.  Sounds like I have been floxed_ huh?   Is there any chance these symptoms might clear soon?   I have been off of the drug now for 6 days.,M,38,4  days,9/11/2008Email,Cipro

I felt really bad and really depressed. I read most of these reports from other people and I felt even worse_ it didn't help. I would like to tell anyone who is experiencing the same thing: YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.  I investigated a lot about Cipro Side Effects_ the doctors do not know about the side effect and almost all of them dont believe you.  In some cases the side effects as insomnia and neuropathy could appear until 2 month after take Cipro and the Doctors do not link Cipro and with side effects.  Don't overload yourself with appointments_ medicines_ and specialists the doctors wont believe you.  I found a very serious research about Cipro side effects on www.fluoroquinolones.org also I spoke to some friends that are doctors (some of them investigated on medical magazines and reviewed the latest papers related with Cipro Side effects) and believe me_ your symptoms are most likely due to your side effects.

After last dose became super ill and ended up in the ER and was admitted for the night.  My body was one giant hive_ hands so swollen they had turned blue and really painful_ so were the bottom of my feet.  Had really bad chills to the point of not being able to control my motor skills.  Doctors thought it a bit strange that I didn't have this reaction prior to finishing the dose.  Put me on Prednisone for a week.  Feeling much better_ just weak and can't handle any kind of heat.

He made me feel like it was in my head since a urinalysis showed that the infection was gone.  He sent me back home and said that if I was still feeling bad in 4 days_ he would refer me to a urologist.

I was having jarbbled thinking and trouble figuring out how to do basic things like pour a glass of water_ when I was feeling okay an hour or so ago)_ difficulty concentrating (I felt like I couldn't put together one clear thought or focus on what I was doing)_ anxiety/nervousness_ restlessness_ mild carpal tunnel pain_ vision change (everything seemed slightly blurrier_ but it wasn't too bad)_ stiffness_ body pain_ an overall feeling of terrible heaviness_ including of the chest.  It felt like the medication was damaging my body; like it was eating away at my muscles or something.  I felt like death_ just a lifeless feeling at my best moments on this drug.,Something about this drug doesn't seem right; Its too strong and I shouldn't have this many side effects after taking it for such a short time.  I even took a strong antibiotic once called Rifampin with worse side effects listed than this_ and even had some of them_ but it wasnt as bad.  I dont want to continue a prescription that seems to be doing damage to my mind.  Im feeling better after being off of it for almost thirty six hours_ but not completely yet.  Hopefully I will_ and may others too I pray.  Please_ somebody_ get this drug off the market or provide more severe and detailed warnings with it.  If that had been done_ I might have thought twice before taking it.  And then if people still want to risk their health they at least have the knowledge before they decide.

I am slowly recovering. Most notable change during these six month: anxiety has mostly disappeared while joint problems have considerably worsened. Hopefully it will resorb eventually. These side effects are not that frequent (maybe 5% of patients or less)_ but now I know they are very serious and can last for months or years. I experienced 1 month of hell and 5 month of purgatory.

That night I experienced severe night sweats_ anxiety_ restlessness and fits of depression. (Somewhat like an overdose of hydrocortisone.) I didn't get to sleep until 3AM_ and then only slept for 3 hours. I didn't take any Cipro the following day. After several bouts of diarrhea_ the malaise passed off.  I believe that what I experienced was essentially an allergic reaction_ but there are aspects of the side effects which lead me to believe that Cipro can be neurotoxic (night sweats and anxiety).

I took it for an infection in my throat and the entire duration of the 4 days was hell. I could not concentrate at work or college. By the time the sun went down_ depression started and I couldn't get my happiness back at all. Physiological depression is the worst feeling. Don't take any Quinolones if your problem isn't serious.

My doctor switched me to cipro so I cautiously started the treatment - because i already had 3 days worth of the other drug the doc said if i started to get sick then i could stop after 3 days. However after a day I felt immediate relief_ the other drug had me so knocked out that the cure was worse than the disease. I finished out the cipro without any side effects that were serious as listed here on this board. Hours after taking it i noticed i'd have bad indigestion/heartburn sensation and a headache even with food and water. But overall my body responded well and I could go to work again and feel normal. Every drug has a different reaction for every person. The best rule of thumb is_ if you notice your drug is making you sick - have your doctor switch to something else.

I called the doctor at urgent care as soon as I started feeling these same symptoms today. He told the nurse to tell me to keep taking the CIPRO - that the symptoms weren't from the drug_ that it couldnt cause these symptoms so quickly after the first dose.  I asked to be changed to a different anti-biotic and he wouldn't do it.  He said that that it must be something else_ I wouldn't be having the symptoms so soon after taking the drug.  I told the nurse on the phone that if he didn't change,These are my symptoms within one or two hours of taking CIPRO: muscle aches_ diarrhea_ nausea_ fatigue_ depression and a feeling of horrible malaise.  All that I could do was lie on the couch and feel crappy. The doctor made me feel like it was in my head and that I was a big baby.  Thanks for everyone's comments.

My advice: Don't drink milk or consume dairy products_ don't take vitamins or consume anything with a lot of iron_ zinc or magnesium_ don't consume ANY caffeine or chocolate_ and drink as much water as possible daily.  The most serious side effects I've come across on this page seem to represent less than 1% of the millions,M,30,2  weeks,10/17/2007,Cipro

I immediately stopped taking all medication.   Then tingly feet set in.  A week later_ I had some chicken and had another reaction - antibiotics in chicken - now I eat only organic.  But instead of going away_ I have gotten has continually gotten worse - burning feet and hands_ creeping up the arms and legs.  Alcohol makes the sensations worse as does bright sunlight.,It has been 18 months since this happened and I still have burning feet_ hands and lower arms. Not debiliating - I still exercise and can run. Just very annoying - have to ignore.  Have had brain scan_ two different neurologists including Mayo as well as scores of tests to see if the problem was caused by something else - but it is too coincidental to taking cipro.  I also think it effected by thyroid - fluorides are said to do that.   The only thing I can say is that I finally got the Dr. at Mayo to admit that cipro might have produced these effects.  Everyone says it should go away eventually - ie nerves take a long time to heal. But I am beginning to think i will have to live with this sensation for ever.

I've done alot of research on this subject and have found that Cranberry juice or Blueberry Juice is supposed to ward off any urinary infections.  I haven't tried the Blueberry juice yet.

There have been many substantiated reports of serious tendon and ligament damage suffered by weight lifters and athletes while taking cipro. These injuries usually occur at the tail end of treatment and in the week or so after discontinuing the drug. A personal perspective_ I waited close to a week after finishing the 10 day treatment to start exercising again_ and I figured I'd start light with some push-ups. I've experienced pain after push-ups before (especially after taking some time off) but nothing like this. I'm much more sore than I should be (or have ever been) after doing push-ups. So it looks like I'm going the very conservative route for the next couple weeks. I've been doing light cardio and not much else.

1650, 1, UTI,I had an extremely bad reaction but it is more common than you might think. The list of symptoms in the insert is all from people who took it after it went to market. What does that tell you. Your Dr. will not only not tell you about the side effects he or she will likely laugh or ignore you or ask if you need psych drugs. This is for real. They need to wake up. I had symptoms involving my nervous system_ I had huge episodes of fear like I can't even describe - not panic_ FEAR_ and I was not a fearful person before taking this.  I was a joyous person.  I could not stop going to the bathroom but that phase was followed by severe dehydration which has continued to this day TWO YEARS or more later.  I have dehydration and dry eyes all the time.   I am not the same person I was.  I feel this  has aged me 20 yrs.  I had the worst symptoms in the first year.  At first I could not walk could barely tolerate the touch of a blanket.  I could not open a bottle of water or open a package of food,AFter two years a lot of the symptoms have improved and I can walk normally but not as fast or long as I used to.  At least I can appear normal.  It has atrophied a lot of my muscles.  I suspect it damaged my thyroid.   What this does to people is so weird. Doctors will just test you for known illnesses and this causes things that are not known.  If you have a bad reaction don't panic_ you will need all your inner and physical strength to survive and go past this.   It will take all your strength of mind. ABove all know that this is NOT YOU but it is a toxic poison that is wreaking havoc on  your tissues and nerves.   I found out that a lot of doctors are idiots.   It will take a while for medicine to catch up to the damage it is causing with POISON PILLS such as Cipro and its sister drugs.

Please note that CIPRO is NOT EFFECTIVE against Chlamydia as the ER doctor had evidently thought. I was prescribed to take this pill twice a day for 14 days and took it for 10 days before I was told I needed to go back to the ER for what I've learned is probably antibiotic-induced-colitis caused by this terrible drug!,M,18,10  days,2/26/2007Email,Cipro

1667, 3, Bacterial Prostatitis,This was a milder attack than the first and was on the mend before I started Cipro (2 days after first symptoms). By day four the obvious signs of prostatitis had abated_ apart from the odd twinge.  However_ I had a set of other symptoms this time that were familiar from my first brief acquaintance with Cipro: dizziness on waking (dismissed as BPPV last time)_ tachycardia (my usual pulse rate is very slow)_ my first ever faint (on a treadmill just after I finished a run)_ periodic shortness of breath_ difficulty clearing my chest_ anxiety & nervousness_ sleeplessness_ night fevers_ depression_ sadness_ pessimism - all the sort of stuff that it is easy to write-off as typical_ post-illness. However_ after 10-days this time I got back to exercise by taking long walks and a few days after that I took my first easy run.  I was aware of the possibility of Achilles tendon rupture by now and had discussed it with the last doctor_ who said it was a risk of all drugs in this class but mostl,"This is my second encounter with Cipro. I had it for a week six-months ago when I reported an initial bout of prostatitis to the doctor.  Subsequently_ a specialist put me on doxycycline (and 400mg ibuprofen) for a month.  Seemed like an odd choice_ given that a month of Cipro is emerging as the UK ""gold-standard"" for ABP (and the ibu combo is frowned on).  However_ he knew I ran - about five miles almost daily...  This time round I had a urine sample analysed by a clinic immediately_ which identified an e-coli infection. Yet another doctor agreed that a month of Cipro made sense to try and eradicate any prostate infection. I also requested Ibuprofen again and reluctantly (risk of fits with Cipro) received a scrip for a two-week course. I might add that a PSA test that I was grudgingly granted first time round had come in at 17 (should be below 2)_ which had prompted the first doc (who had_ naturally_ assumed that I had anything but prostatitis) to do a complete 180_ send me",M,48,30  days,1/31/2007,Cipro

My Dr. switched me from Levaquin to Doxycycline which after 2 weeks on the meds_ my infection flared up.  My Dr. demanded I take Cipro.  Note that I started on this after 2 weeks on Doxycycline which failed to cure my infection. Unlike Levaquin_ Cipro XR1000 was very well tollerated by me.  I did quit all caffeine when I started the drug_ which probably helped minimize any side effects. Cipro started clearing my infection with first dose.

1700, 1, UTI,CIPRO was prescribed to me for only three days for a UTI and now I have a constant sense of urgency to urinate -- something I never experienced before taking this drug except immediately before on another antibiotic generic for Microbid.  I discontinued that antibiotic and the urgency problem went away but apparently I still had traces of bacteria.  That's when the doctor prescribed the CIPRO.,It's been 48 hours since my last CIPRO pill and I am still having severe problems with urgency even though I took a dose of Acidophilus thinking perhaps the CIPRO had merely wiped out my good bacteria as well as the bad.  Apparently it's wiped out more than that -- ie. the proper functioning of my kidneys.  Hope it will come back.  I remember an elderly lady friend of mine who was on antibiotics before becoming completely incontinent.  Wonder if it was CIPRO or a similar drug.  Wonder if there's a correlation between the prevalence of Detrol_ etc. and the use by gynecologists of antibiotics like CIPRO.  Please comment if you know.,F,,3  days,9/24/2006,Cipro

Most bothersome to me was flushing - 8-10 times per day and during the night_ I would get very hot and very sweaty.  It only lasted a minute or two but was almost unbearable when it happened - felt like I was burning up.  Was taking Flagyl 500 mg 3X/day and Cipro 500 mg 2X/day_ so not sure which one was doing it.  Had had both of them IV in the hospital for a week_ and did not have side effects when it was IV_ so assume effects are related to metabolism by the GI tract / liver / kidneys.,Hope it did what it was supposed to do (get rid of bacteria in abscess). Relative to that goal_ side effects were certainly tolerable and not a really big deal (I've certainly been carrying on my normal work and life schedule) - but definitely more noticeable side effects than with some other antibiotics.,F,49,14  days,9/12/2006,Cipro

1756, 1, kidney infection,acute tendonitis_ some nightmares,I would recommend that you not take this drug if you have ever had tendonitis before. I had had recurring episodes of hip tendonitis from running over the last 20 years_ and it was primarily my right hip (near the right kidney_ where the infection was) that flared up on the drug (interestingly_ my right hand was also sore_ where i had torn a ligament skiing the year before).  The pain started almost immediately but was difficult to diagnose. I stopped the drug after 5 days but experienced the most acute episode two days after stopping the drug.The various postings on this site that indicated that this pain might NEVER subside had me worried that i might never run again or even live normally ever again. I am writing now mainly to reassure visitors to this site that there is hope if you experience severe tendonitis while on_ and even after stopping_ this drug. If you do take this drug_ stop the drug immediately upon noticing any tendonitis_ especially in areas that have been sore before.,F,42,5  days,3/8/2006,Cipro

I had tremors_ morbid thoughts of death_ just to name a few. I went to the emergency room and off cipro. Now_ 2 weeks later_ I'm having an anxiety attack every day.

That night pill #5_ more anxious_ irritable_ could not sleep.  #6_ could not breath_ anxiety_ trembling in hands and fascia muscles across upper body.  Emergency room visit and the doc immediatly took me off of it and told me of similar problems with other patients.,Where did this stuff come from?  This is my first UTI requiring meds_ my wife gets them somewhat frequenty and was always given Macrobid(SP?).  I have never heard of this being given as such a generic antibiotic.  Mother had severe stomach reactions also.Still feeling tense_ hands shake on and off.  I hope this goes away with time.  Even my family doctor told me of the exact same symptoms when she took a sister drug for bronchitis.  She was not the prescribing doctor.Now I'm waiting on anxiety drugs to stem off the feeling until it passes out of me.   What a nightmare.

Up to 1999 had 3 or 4 attacks and the medicin prescribed to me made by very tired so my Doctor changed it Cipro March 1999.  In April-May 1999 I developed serious muscle pains and was suspected having PMR_ although my arthritis doctor ended up suspecting reactive arthritis.  Summer 1999 was mere hell_ sleeping was difficult and my short term memory started failing. Up till that time (I was 52) I had been running an average of 40-50 miles each week and was in excellent health.  'Cipro symptoms' lasted over two years and eventually most faded away.  I had 2-3 year pause in the diverticulitis attacks till late September 2005.  I took my Cipros for 5 days.  'CIPRO' symptons came back equally severe October 2005.I went to websites and after 30 minute search_ the case was closed - at least on the issue what had been causing my symptoms.  One of the privileges being a Finn is that you can swim in ice,Worked wonderfully curing the effects of Diverticulitis.Took Cipro maybe 5-6 times between 1999 and 2005five days at each timeI hope somebody will class action suit hell out the manufacturer.,M,58,5  days,11/24/2005Email,Cipro

During the almost four years since taking Cipro_ these same muscles/tendons/joints in my back have been very easily aggravated (e.g. carrying anything heavy_ jarring from running_ etc.) Throbbing pain sufficient to wake me up at night to take Ibuprofen or to stand in a hot shower. Never had the slightest symptom before the Cipro.,Despite instructions to be sure to finish taking all the medication_ I quit taking it after three days because I couldn't stand the pain.  Discovered upon checking standard dosages on the web that I probably should have been given only 100 mg for three days_ rather than 500 mg for six days.

Sure there where some fun times_ butI can't even dream of or picture a day long ago_ when I wasn't inagonizing pain every moment of my life.I am very limited as to the type of work I can do_ and as a result could not afford money to pay for any type of college.It has effected my parents very much over the years.  They don't like to see me in pain all the time_ and they have to help me out a lot.  And 5 years worth of pain killer prescription drugs can really cost a lot_ and it's still costing!I would do anything to go back in time and change the fact that I ever took this horrible drug_ Cipro.  I hope I bastards who created this will someday know the pain and suffering they hasve caused me.  And as I stated_ I hope for compensation.  If anyone has any helpful info for me please email me!Dan,This drug should be taken off the market but I still hope that a mass lawsuit will someday help to compensate the loss and pain of those who have had negavtive side effects to this horrible drug.

Encouraged by my boyfriend who is against nearly all prescription drugs (he swears most are not even neccesary_ and in most cases the side effects are worse than the diseases they are prescribed to treat)_ he said why don't I look up some information online. I found this site right away_ and needless to say I have been very enlightened_ and more than thoroughly disgusted. Why this drug is still on the market is beyond me. I feel 100% positive that I am sick now because of it. Never again will I accept a prescription for this drug_ and I sincerely hope that I do not continue with these symptoms_ or develop something even worse later_ like some of the cases here I have read. This drug has put my life in a bad situation; my 84 year old mother depends on me to be up and available to help her and I have hardly been able to drag myself out of bed all day_ much less do anything for her. I didn't sleep a wink last night_ I kept imagining I heard things_ or felt insects in my bed and several times last night I just laid there and watched my computer moniter across the room undulate and shimmer/flicker (I know it really wasn't). When I did drift off_ I woke abruptly from terrifying nightmares_ in a panicky state. I feel like I am 100 years old. It's taken me about 30 minutes to write this_ because I cannot concentrate_ and I keep staring off into space in a fog.I encourage anyone who has been prescribed this drug to demand something else in it's place. Don't take it.,F,40,7  days,8/2/2005,Cipro

1806, 1, ear infection/sinus,My dad has had severe sinus and ear infections all his life and taken many different antibiotics and never had a reaction. His head swelled and turned red and a had a 104+ fever_ only to mention a few symptoms. The worst part was the doctor swears he can't be allergic to Cipro and gave it to him again and the same thing happened. If he hadn't stopped taking them - do to the family insisting_ I don't know what might have happened. The doc (ear specialist) was informed and still obviously didn't believe us and gave him a derivative of Cipro the next time (my mom and dad didn't bother researching it) The scary swelling and redness and fever started again until my sis and I looked it up and it was Generic Cipro_ so he immediately stopped taking it. The doctor has written in the chart (now that my mom insisted not to give him Cipro again),If you even think you are having a reaction to this drug_ stop taking it immediately- Don't let a dr tell you that you can't be having a reaction to it.

1814, 1, UTI,You name it! These drugs are horrible and the worst side effects a lot more common than they let on. IF you have the bad effects_ get ready for doctors to deny the cause being Cipro_ and tell you there is nothing they can do anyway. Most tests are normal but the really weird ones. But it is a living HELL that just gets worse_ new symptoms popping up months or YEARS later. I don't know what this drug does to people but it's devastating.  If there is ANYTHING ELSE you can take_ ask for it. I had racing heart_ insomnia_ terrifying dreams_ waking nightmares_ panic attacks off the charts (never before this!)_ incredible pain all over_ weakness_ extreme exhaustion_ food reactions really bizarre_ joints feeling like they could move backwards_ achilles and other tendons burning and feeling very dry_ extreme dehydration_ nerve tingling/itching/buzzing. Too many almost to list!  And I was healthy before. Now have symptoms almost like lupus! Which is a known effect of this type of drug (quinolones). Eye pain_ metallic taste in mouth_ unable to look at lights_ dry eyes_ dry rubbery skin_ dark ropy veins appearing_ it's a nightmare. Like I am now twice my age.,NINE MONTHS after stopping taking the Cipro_ which I only took for five days (it's happened to people after ONE pill though)_ I still not only have symptoms but NEW symptoms. This has killed healthy cells in my body and attacked the thyroid_ also shut down ovary function totally. I was basically healthy and tests show the difference from before & after Cipro. Sky high ANA_ ENA and DNA antibodies and thyroid antibodies. EXTREME confusion and brain fog. Changed moods/personality. Can't handle stress at ALL now. Can't eat most foods_ just organic fruits/veggies. Anything else and the intense muscle/joint/tendon pain comes back. Latest symptom is dark ropy veins appearing all over arms and body. Also_ hands turning bony_ I used to have pretty hands =(  It is like all my tissue is atrophying. Elbow bones sticking out far_ and elbow skin sagging. Like I woke up and someone 80 yrs old had traded bodies with me. FSH went up by *120 points* from taking Cipro. Had just had it tested the week prior. This drug should be pulled entirely or ONLY given for last resorts_ NOT common UTI! Doctors themselves do not know how horrible this is and there is little way to prove it_ how do you prove PAIN? Bone pain so bad in the beginning I thought I would pass out. Plus_ thanks to taking this I can no longer take anything_ since it effects even that. I have no idea why_ but it does for many people. Can no longer eat nightshade vegetables_ those increase the pain. Can no longer eat most fish/meat_ farmers give Baytril which is a form of CIpro_ to animals. Body goes haywire in CIpro victims if they eat that stuff. NINE MONTHS of my life taken up by this_ too weak to do anything but sit or lay around_ I try and walk when I can. Then I have to rest a few days. Peripheral neuropathy and have had days when I could not WALK at all. Had to use wheelchair at age 42!!  Scared of future. DO NOT take this stuff if you have a chance not to - ask your Dr. for another type of pill_ or go the natural route_ if it is not life or death. Search online for more info. The quinolones are torturous.  I still cannot sleep right. Now those dark purple veins everywhere - this is just ONE LONG NIGHTMARE since Cipro.,F,42,5  days,5/20/2005,Cipro

Presently am having severe sharp ankle and shin pains as if a knife is being ground in through my muscles and bones. Am unable to sleep due to the shooting pains that attack me at any and all times.

I stopped after four days and seem to be turning the corner on the side effects.  The prostitis_ if thats what I had_ is still here.  I think the dr. may have missed a muscle pull or hernia and the cipro  is obviously of no benefit there.  I agree with many of the comments above_ be sure you need this.

I am pretty sure that these symptoms mentioned here by me are very SLOW in subsiding. My advise would be to first determine if the protratitis is a result of yeast related bacteria. If not_ I would advise finding an alternative method of treating it being that it will have no effect on the situation.

I couldn't even concentrate enough to read a national geographic.  He said I had a bad infection and that I should try and stick it out_ that they hate to change meds in the middle of the prescription.  I told them I couldn't stick it out.

1853, 4, pseudomonis  (on going),I take cipro as an on going treatment.  A year ago I came down with the lung bacterial infection pseudomas_ due to a genetic mutation in my body for Cystic Fibrosis.

I have experienced systemic yeast infections because the Cipro causes  a digestive disturbance.  The Dr's nurse told me to go to the health food store and buy some Acidophilus pills ( which are kept refrigerated)  These have eliminated that problem.  I also eat lots of yogart with the active cultures.  I have not had any further yeast infection since I started taking them.
