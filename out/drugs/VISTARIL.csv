0, 1, anxiety/insomia,I switched insurance plans and was given a new doctor who informed me that she doesn't believe in Xanax and refused to prescribe it_ even though I had been using Xanax with great results for a few years. I never abused Xanax..as a matter of fact I always had pills left over when my Dr would refill. Took vistaril for 2 nights. I had the most horrible dreams imaginable. Very vivid..very real...scared me half to death. Was afraid to take it during the day. I have been living with this horrible anxiety untreated for 2 years now. I don't understand how insurance companies can dictate what Dr you can see_ or how a Dr can take you off a drug that has made your life livable.,,F,57,2  days,7/31/2016,Vistaril

2, 1, Anxiety,This med made me psychotic and paranoid,I was taking zoloft for depression and last year was prescribed vistaril for anxiety.  I don't  know how I spent the last year of my life.  I don't know where I have been or what I have done. I have bits and pieces of memory.   I went missing and my family filed a missing person with the police.  The police found me in a seedy motel.  I was convulsing and had no control over my bowels and bladder.  I was unable to walk and my blood pressure was off the charts.  Taken to ER.  After many tests_ I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder_ panic attacks_ delusional_ anxiety_ and psychotic.  I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.  The psychiatrist increased the vistaril for anxiety and insomnia.  I had uncontrollable jerking and felt as if my body was infested with bugs.  I was discharged after 10 days.  I fell and broke my arm and wrist.  My behavior was out of control.  Screaming at my family_ thinking they were trying to murder my daughters.  I was taken back to the psychiatric hospital_ but was refused admission after talking to a psychiatrist.  He diagnosed me with a sleep disorder_ saying my behavior was due to lack of sleep.  I was found in another motel_ on the floor_ with a broken leg.  I was totally disabled with a broken left arm and right leg.  Back to psychiatric hospital.  Same diagnosis_ sleep disorder.  I was told to keep taking vistaril to sleep.  Months later my brother found me near death at my parents home.  Back to ER.  I was given klonapin for anxiety and final,F,60,1  years50 mg. 4X D,5/19/2016Email,Vistaril

My question is why the hell did my Dumbass Dr. give me this medicine for itching. I have a headache just reading everybody else's side effects.,This is why Dr get sued if I would have taken this medicine before looking it up on Google I would have a lawsuit against my Dumbass Dr right now.

I was prescribed it for anxiety off label_ 25mgs three times at most a day as needed. I became psychotic and paranoid after one pill. I have Bipolar1 and possible chronic psychotic symptoms underlying my mental illness_ but still---I had a very dangerous reaction. It made me do all kinds of crazy crazy stuff like change my FB profile 20 times and rant and wow my anxiety was non-existent_ get it? I had no normal reactions. Everyone laughed it off and thought I was high. I was high_ high as a kite on crack. I could have committed suicide_ I ""felt"" like killing people. Not for any reason...at all...and I knew it was wrong_ just thoughts out of nowehre! I had a whole conspiracy evolve from my dad moving out and the addresses changed after 25mgs in one day.

23, 4, Anxiety & Insomnia,twitches_ dry mouth (can be extreme at times)_ occasional lack of appetite but I'm not sure that's because of this medication,I began taking this medication for anxiety whilst in rehab for my benzodiazepine addiction_ ironically. I was referred to studies conducted comparing the efficacy of Vistaril to Ativan for long-term anxiety control. Vistaril_ over time_ far out performs benzodiazepines for anxiety AND doesn't cause dependency. I take it TID (once upon waking_ once in the afternoon_ and one at bedtime) every single day. If I don't take it or forget a dose_ I do notice an increase in anxiety_ but nothing compared to forgetting to take a Xanax or Klonopin (both of which I was prescribed for years). Anyway_ the reason I give this drug a 4/5 and not a 5/5 is for two reasons: the intense_ almost 24/7 dry mouth it causes and_ more importantly_ the restless legs and / or arms it causes along with 'feeling the need to move'.,M,24,4  months50mg TID,8/18/2015,Vistaril
24, 5, Panic Attacks,Decreased anxiety symptoms_ decreased panic attack symptoms,I started to have panic attacks during the night and would have anxiety symptoms during the day. Thought I would give Vistaril 50 mg a try b/c I don't want to use a medication that can cause dependency or effect my work. It has been great. Anxiety symptoms are gone. Panic attack symptoms have decreased to where I awaken but can reason myself out of having full blown symptomology. I am considering trying 75 mg at bedtime to see if that will stop the panic attack from occurring altogether. I have had no negative side effects. Individuals should attempt this medication prior to using an anti-anxiolytic.,F,53,7  days50,7/16/2015,Vistaril
25, 1, Anxiety,It has taken me a little while to figure out what medicine was giving me awful side effects. Vistrail is the worst med I have ever been on_ and I have been on so many. I can't remember having any noticeable side effect with ANY meds_ but this one is the Worst I could ever imagine.  Body twitching_ eyes hurt(wierd) I am so hungry_helium head_ dizzy when bending over_ which has made me fall 9 times in 6 weeks_ Hearing Voices + Noises that are not there. As I heard the voices_ in my head I knew they weren't real. Paranoid ~ I thought I heard someone in my side yard_ and it's all wooded there. I heard them crunch thru the woods_ then their truck pulling up beside my house. There was no way this was possible_ especially since I had the window closed_ AC_ fan and television on. I saw the shadows. I had the crazy dreams_ sweats_ hands trembling_ cotton mouth and muscle weakness. I'm not positive about the muscle as I have been trying to figure this out. Anyway_ my muscles twitch like crazy and even had a scalp twitch. I stood up a few times and wanted to go in the other room.,"IT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP WITH MY ANXIETY. AS A MATTER OF FACT THE VOICES_ MOVING SHADOWS_ NIGHT TERRORS_MUSCLE TWITCHES and DIZZINESS TO WHERE I KEEP FALLING...Yeah_ the Doctor was right_ this is so much better than the Xanax I'd been taking for years. The side effects of the Xanax was MY ANXIETY WENT AWAY!  Geez_ my grandfather used to say_""if it ain't broken_ don't fix it.""  I guess everyone is punished because young adults are buying and taking them. Now anyone who is on a Benzine or Opiate_ they torture you_ finding new meds. Those young adults will still get their hands on it the while others who actually need it can't.  BRAVO!",F,45,2  months50mg X 3,7/12/2015Email,Vistaril

27, 2, Anxiety,Knocked unconscious and severe swelling and pain in feet. I can't even walk or stand it is excruciating.,Works great to knock someone unconscious but I have 4 children and was prescribed this because I went to the ER shortly after my baby was born suffering from severe post partum anxiety. I explained that there are only Xanax or Valium help without making me a zombie and they gave me this crap. I asked the nurse if it would make me pass out and she told me no that it doesn't do that.  Clearly I can see that is inaccurate and I'm very disappointed in this medication as it causes severe pain in my feet so that I cannot walk for several days after just 1 pill. I have taken 3 pills this time over the course of 48 hours and my feet are still extremely painful 2 days after my last dose.,F,30,2  days50mg,6/10/2015,Vistaril

30, 1, Ended up in ER with panic attack,I have taken this medication before. ONCE a night while detoxing from alcohol almost three years ago. Made me feel loopy and tired and gave me weird dreams. THIS time I was prescribed it 4 times a day (100mg) total after an emergency visit for a severe panics attacks and thought I was having a heart attack. A few days in I noticed my hands tremoring_ had stomach aches_ weird dreams_ night sweats and heart palpitations. Last night I had to call an ambulance. I took exactly as prescribed. My my left arm and leg were tingling_ my left arm still hurts_ my BP and HR were through the roof and I was seeing stars and about to pass out. I terrified I was dying. Today my hands won't stop shaking and twitching_ my stomach hurts_ my heart is pounding like crazy and my arm is still in pain. Throwing them out... WORST THING I COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN. I suffer from GAD_ OCD_ Bipolar_ Major depression and ED. I am awaiting getting back on my Celexa and Buspar_ which together do wonders for me.

I ONLY take this when I know I am able to stay home the next day. I am literally exhausted and cannot wake up for at least 24 hours. Sure the anxiety goes away because I'm passed out!

My body is constantly craving sugar and caffeine for energy! I have noticed my self eating more and more throughout the day!

I had no problems the first day and was sleeping through the night. However_ I started seeing shadows and other visual hallucinations that progressively got worse. Then I started hearing voices. . I will say_ it did wonders for my anxiety_ but I felt like my thought process would slow way down after I took the Vistaril. The hallucinations got worse. I would see shadows whiz pass me and felt like I could not tune out the voices. I decided to stop taking it thinking no big deal_ I've only been on it a week. I was fine the first day_ but the second day I woke up with a massive migraine and spent the entire morning throwing up.

59, 5, Panic Attacks,At first I was nervous to take Vistaril; but when I woke up in the morning_ I realized that Vistaril helped me sleep throughout the night; no bad dreams at all. I took it with Lisinopril 2.5mgs to help lower the blood pressure that comes with having severe anxiety. I was a bit drowsy the next morning_ but was able to do things calm and collected.,Premature to say anything about Vistaril and its effects; but I do know that the stress that my body had is stabilized at the moment; that is 1 time dosage of 25mgs at 9:00pm. I plan to stay off it once I return to the gym_ but will continue to use my 2/5mgs of Lisinopril; because anxiety does_ and can_ cause an increase of blood pressure_ not even funny. Vistaril I used before_ but I didn't use it as recommended; now this 2nd time around I did and it did wonders. I thought I will be at the ER again with a blood pressure reading of 189/117_ but so far my blood pressure reading_ on Vistaril has been 119/70 or 129/82. Not bad!! And pulse below 80. I do not plan to take it for a duration of time; as I don't want to be zombie like or disconnected from the world. But for an emergency basis_ Vistaril has been a life savor; not to mention faith and believe in my savior Jesus.,M,42,1  days25mg 1X D,10/31/2013Email,Vistaril
60, 1, Severe Insomnia,Tremors_ muscle twitches_ leg and muscle pain_ anxiety,"At first I thought this was a wonder drug helping finally get some sleep.  But this is NOT to be taken long term.  The problem is that I have a few other debilitating issues in addition to relentless insomnia.  It took me a long time to realize that it was this ""harmless"" antihistamine that was causing a host of bizarre symptoms including:  depression_ twitches_ tics_ excessive worrying_ blundering through life in a fog and generally wishing I was dead.  This evil sh!t is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Stay far_ far away unless you want to end up in the psych ward or ER.  Doctors or the FDA should be sued for prescribing/allowing this poison.

63, 1, Sinus Congestion,Sedation_ groggyness_ tremor_ panic_ anxiety_ paranoia,This medication is TERRIBLE..took 100mg in one day. 25mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for sinus congestion. It helped with the congestion and the anxiety that I was experiencing but once it wore off. That's when everything hit the fan. I developed tremors in my lower jaw_ lip_ and muscle twitches in my arm and leg. It also caused me to have weird hypnogogic jerks when ever I attempted to go to sleep at night. I have been very on and off with this drug and it has done nothing but make me needlessly worry about whether or not something is wrong with me. I started experiencing all of this crap one day after taking it. I can't wait for all of this to get out of my system. I hated this drug so much that I threw the rest of it in the garbage can. I really DO NOT recommend this drug to anyone. There are better methods for anxiety and sinus congestion and this is coming from a person who has really high levels of anxiety and chronic problems with sinuses.,F,23,3  weeks25mg 4X D,9/12/2013Email,Vistaril

All that this medication truly is_ is a prescribed form of Benadryl.

I find other antihistamines like diphenhydramine (benadryl) and doxylamine much more sedating_ and for that reason better for anxiety_ although sedation is only an indirect way of treating anxiety.

Definitely puts me to sleep at night_ and I sleep very soundly. The only problem is that I don't wake up. I will sleep right through any alarm. Generally speaking_ this medication makes me sleep about 17-18 hours. It's completely unmanageable. There is no reason I should be sleeping this long_ but when I take this medication_ it is impossible for me to get out of bed before then. If I manage to get out of bed at a reasonable time_ I am extremely tired all day_ and feel like I could go right back to sleep any minute. This is terrible.

90, 2, Anxiety,brain fog_ hangover_ drowsy_ depersonalization_ anxiety_ potential hallucinations_ depression,I was prescribed this a few days ago as an alternative to a benzodiazepine for anxiety.  The first dose of 25mg was ok-- it calmed my body down_ certainly.  Unfortunately_ it also made me feel detached and somewhat depressed.  It was manageable at first_ but as I tried more doses later in the day and night (I took 4 doses overall)_ the brain fog_ detachment_ and depression worsened.  Any time I tried to sleep on it_ (which was twice)_ I woke up many times with night sweats and bizarre dreams.  While napping during my last dose_ I had a period of about 2 hours where I couldn't tell if I was dreaming or awake and I heard talking that wasn't there-- really freaked me out.  Anyway_ I think I'm done with this drug.  I would recommend trying it if you want to avoid benzodiazepines_ many people have very good reactions to it.  I was afraid that I might not because I have had similar reactions when I have taken more than one dose of benadryl for sleep for a day or two.

112, 5, Anxiety,Heavy headedness,During a time of great anxiety it came in very handy_ and the daytime groggy symptoms soon subsided. It appears to be a relatively little known treasure that is perhaps as safe as it gets in terms of addictive properties and uncomfortable side effects. My recommended dosage was 50mg in the morning and afternoon for anxiety (although I often skipped the nooner)_ and 150mg in the evening as a sleep aid. I usually of not always lowered the  evening dose to 100 mg and it seemed to still be effective while lessening the daytime fatigue. Apparently it is a very versatile and unique antihistamine that has significantly passed the test of time. No withdrawal effects after discontinuation.

I don't know how well it works for anxiety_ because I can't stay awake following a dose.  Also_ aches and pains in my legs_ but that is probably from laying in the bed for 2 days.,F,27,3  days50mg 1X D,8/26/2010,Vistaril

I have tried everything to combat the drowsiness and narcolepsy_ it has not worked at all. It does do wonders for anxiety_ however_ its hard to be anxious and nervous when you are knocked out for 72 hours straight,F,25,6  months150 MG 1X D,8/3/2010Email,Vistaril
126, 5, anxiety,slight drowsiness_ water retention,I was put on this about 2 years ago during a time of extreme stress and it was great. It allowed me to stay calm but was mild enough that I could still think clearly and function properly. From the outside_ you would never know I had taken a medication. Well a new year_ a new job loss_ a new set of god awful circumstances and I found myself in a situation again where I needed to be calm but focused. Vistaril is again helping me to do this. I will say that I do feel a bit puffy from water_ but I'm not wringing my hands and freaking out_ I'm calm enough to do what I need to do. You can always give it a try and just quit if you don't like it...,F,35,14  days25 mgs 4X D,7/28/2010,Vistaril

NOTHING has helped me.  i've been on everything. but i stuck with it for a month.  i was on it 6 times a day and gained a ton of weight. that's all it did for me. and for insomnia_ i can tell you the tv line-up until about 5:00 in the morning. now for my boyfriend_ he's sleeping right now from it and can't wake up.,my family dr told me i could just take them as an antihistamine and smiled.,F,43,1  months50mg 6X D,7/9/2010Email,Vistaril
128, 4, Anxiety,drowsiness,"I take 25 mg twice a day for anxiety. I was going through my life constantly ""on edge."" I always felt like I was about to have a panic attack. So far_ this drug has been WONDERFUL for me. It makes me a little sleepy_ but nothing that I can't handle with a little bit of caffeine. (I work 12-hour night-shifts. I can take a pill at 9 pm_ and I'm still able to stay up all night.) I don't feel myself turning completely red when I talk to people anymore_ and I don't have that constant nervous/anxious feeling. I really hope it stays this way. I had forgotten what it was like to feel ""normal."" Thank goodness for Vistaril! :o",F,24,4  days25 2X D,7/5/2010,Vistaril
129, 5, Counter withdrawals from Xanax,Shallow breathing_ heart slowed down_ numbness & swelling in my face_ dry mouth,Vistaril saved my life when I was trying to stop taking Xanax.  I couldn't go off of it due to the horrible side effects when I tried lowering the dosage.  The Vistaril is also for anxiety and is not addictive.  A doctor in ER gave it to me when I went there in desperation while trying to stop Xanax.  Not only did it help me sleep_ it helped with the anxiety as well.  I had to stop taking it due to waking up during the night and my face being numb.  The next morning it was swollen and still numb.  I now take Melatonin and vitamin B5 to sleep and it works great.,F,49,21  days25 mg 1X D,6/23/2010,Vistaril

131, 1, For Insomia and Anxiety,Severe daytime drowsiness and anticholinergic brain fog,Avoid it like the plague - it only creates a false drowsiness that you never would have had otherwise. And the drowsiness doesn't go away after a few hours. Wouldn't you rather have your life energy back so that you can function during the day  rather than be sedated into a false soporific stupor all day?,M,47,3  days50 1X D,6/14/2010,Vistaril
132, 1, anxioty and panic,no change in mood panic or anxioty. or even sleep,i was put on vistaril and strattera because of my provider not trusting me from past drug abuse. took them for a 3 weeks in combination with celexa. after missing all my meds for one day i took them the next day and within 45 min my body locked like a full body charlie horse felt like i was being shocked head to tow had to be rushed to the ER by ambulance. took 3 hours to regain mobility and prol 2 days for my brain to recover. so i do not recommend this drug to anyone with out having done the reserch and trusting your provider. i know my case is rare but still real.,M,27,3  weeks100mg 1X D,6/13/2010,Vistaril
133, 3, to help with sleep,What I noticed the most after adding Vistaril to my night time medications was brain fog and difficulty in getting up in the mornings.,I have stopped the Vistaril in an attempt to reduce the number of medications I am taking. I have noticed increased mental clarity_ and a slight increase in energy. The energy increase didn't last.I contribute that particular symptom to my MS. I do think that taken over a period of time_ Vistaril is slightly addictive. I have noticed some depression_ increased irritability_ and some diarrhea. This is the fourth day since I stopped taking the drug.,F,54,5  months25mg 1X D,5/7/2010Email,Vistaril

My family could see what the drug was ding to me so they got me a new Dr. He said i had to get off the benzo's (klonopin_ Xanax) because i was having to many side affects_ he put me on visteril_and i have had no side affects_and it is non-narcotic_ so i won't become addicted.....Thank God For Visteril!!!!,M,31,3  months100mg 1X D,3/28/2010,Vistaril
136, 5, Sleep_ anxiety,Nasty hangover effect in the morning. Very sleepy and sluggish.,I actually really love this medicine. I was on Ambien which works OK_ but my Dr. added this to help me stay asleep longer. This works so well_ I don't even take the ambien anymore. 50mgs will help me relax_ but 100mgs will knock me out. I am glad I found something non-habit forming that works so well. The hangover effect in the morning is brutal_ but i understand that will fade over time.,F,33,1  weeks50-100mg 1X D,3/3/2010,Vistaril

The 2nd night I took it I slept several hours but the sleep was broken and I couldn't fully wake up until about 5 p.m. the next day. I felt drunk and my face felt numb_ my tongue and throat felt like the muscles were tired and I couldn't talk right. Only took it for 2 nights and haven't taken it for 3 nights now and still have tingling in my face and weirdness in my tongue and throat.

I took Vistaril in the past but never had these side effects. It helped for a couple of days but I would wake up with the sweats and horable nightmares. I quit taking it and no more nightmares and hotflases. Thought i was dying on this crap. I rather NOT sleep then have to deal with that.,F,36,4  days,1/22/2010,Vistaril

145, 2, social anxiety disorder,dry mouth_ hunger,I started taking Vistaril because I'm a recovering addict and benzodiazepams (Xanax_ Ativan) are too tempting for me to abuse.  It helped for a minute_ but now it doesn't seem to be as effective.  Maybe it's all in my head or maybe the dosage is wrong.  I hope that I can figure it out because for a few days there I was sure I found a wonder drug.,M,28, ,12/15/2009,Vistaril
146, 4, Anxiety,Tiredness_ feeling good. I liked it. It worked. They would give you it when you got aggressive in lock up. Sometimes a high dose in a shot form_ other times in a pill. Works very well!,,M,18,15  days,12/1/2009Email,Vistaril

I then got a small rash on my stomach. I didn't notice much decrease in my bladder issues.,Might work good as a tranquilizer. I discontinued... Could not deal with the side effects.,M,38,14  days,9/27/2009,Vistaril
149, 1, anxiety_ depression,terrible panic attack_ feelings of uncomfortableness_ paranoia_ feel tired but cant sleep sort of feeling- I feel totally not myself_ just really paranoid and on edge-  I feel I am on the brink of a panic attack..this has been happening to me for the last 2 days-  Ive been taking Vistaril for 2 weeks-  along with Lexapro and Geodon.  I am just assuming the vistaril is the problem bec I take the lexapro in morning and geodon at night-Anyone else having this?  ,I dont think I like it.  Its not working for my anxiety at all-  think its actually making it worse-,F,32,2  weeks,9/23/2009,Vistaril
150, 3, Anxiety/insomnia,Very groggy_ not able to focus_ space-y.,"If you have insomnia_ this is for you; knocked me out cold for 10 hours.  Unfortunately_ I woke up with that ""Nyquil Hangover"" feeling. (I wisely took this when I was not working the next day.) Even taking this 12 hours before_  my Vyvanse (for ADHD) did not work as well.  It was VERY hard for me to focus and get moving the next day.  I can see how this would alleviate anxiety/panic_ but I would not take it during the day unless I felt an attack coming on.  Unless you have adrenaline surging through your system from anxiety_ this drug will wipe you right out.  It might be an alternative to benzos for some.  It doesn't give me nightmares like Ambien did_ but it also makes me ""hungover"" the next day_ which Ambien did NOT do.  I don't know.  I probably won't be taking this again_ unless my insomnia gets really bad.  I'll stick to xanax for the anxiety_ too. I wanted an alternative to benzos_ but so far I haven't found it in a pill. (deep breathing exercises_ walking_ yoga and meditation work much better.)",F,41,3  days,9/13/2009,Vistaril
151, 4, anxiety attacks,Extreme sleepiness.  I take it at night (10 or 11pm) and I have trouble waking up the next day_ sometimes my exhaustion stretches until noon.  Also I wake up very hungry.  I don't eat excessively or anything_ but when I take it I have to eat breakfast.,My dr. prescribed Vistaril for me to take only when I have panic attacks at night.  I take Celexa daily for anxiety_ but I only have panic attacks at night.  So this medicine works for me since it puts me out really fast.,F,25,3  weeks,9/4/2009,Vistaril
152, 4, anxiety/ Xanax addiction,hungry and sleepy,I was having a lot of anxiety and was on Xanax for years. Xanax made me a total pill addict. This med works almost as good as Xanax for anxiety without addiction. It is also a better sleep aid than a max dose of ambien. If you have an addictive personality like me_ skip the benzo drugs (Ativan/Xanax) and try this stuff. Also remember the key to no anxiety is NO caffine.,M,28,10  days,9/4/2009,Vistaril
153, 5, Insomnia/Nightmares/Anxiety,None...except when I've run out. Then I can't sleep and am very irritable. Nighmares plague me when I do not take this med.,I take 400 mg at night for sleep. I also take Neurontin (300 mg twice daily) and Klonopin (3 mg at night). I realize that this is a lot of medication_ however it has enabled me to combat the effects of bipolar disorder_ anxiety disorder_ and PTSD. It helps keep me level throughout the whole next day after I take it at bedtime. Yes_ the sleep is coma-like_ especially when taken with so much Klonopin_ but that's what I need. For me_ this drug has been a God-send. I've recently tried reducing to 300 mg at night_ but it is causing some mild discomfort_ though I will continue to attempt to cut down because I'd like to take less meds. And yes_ I agree...helps with post-menapausal symptoms and I haven't had a cold in 6 years! As an aside_ since so many people have mentioned Klonopin...Klonopin works for me_ much better than Xanax_ but because I've been on such a high dose for so long my doctor and I both agree that should I want to try and come off of it_ it would require inpatient management_ similar to detox.,F,51,6  years,8/19/2009Email,Vistaril
154, 4, anxiety,Very tired....dosed off within 2 hours of taking it....at 6 pm.   Make sure that you can sleep before you take it,I'm going on Celexa for anxiety but it was making me more anxious at first_ so doctor prescribed Vistaril.  I slept like a baby.  Went to bed at 11 and just woke up at 8:30.  Very tired still.  Need to take a shower to wake up.,F,30,2  days,6/25/2009,Vistaril
155, 4, side effects of antidepressant,I have just been prescribed celexa for anxiety but they said it could aggorvate my condition before it gets better.   I took the Vistaril and hour ago at work and feel like I could fall asleep.  Which is weird since it is so light out.,So far the side effects have chilled out a little from the antidepressant.  I am hoping this works as good as xanax because I have been taking them for about a week for anxiety and am afraid to get hooked.,F,30,1  days,6/24/2009Email,Vistaril
156, 2, panic attacks/aniexy,loss of concentration_ drowsiness_ irritablity_ lights to bright_ not really insync with the world_ and loss of memory,I have been taking for about a month and it does help but since I get new fears every week I have to cope.,F,15,1  weeks,6/12/2009Email,Vistaril
157, 4, Panic attacks_ motion sickness,It seems to help my axiety pretty well_ not as well as my ativan_ but still worth trying. It was GREAT for my motion sickness- I dont get nearly as nausiated when i drive or take certain medications.,Helps with sleep- simular to taking benadryl.,F,29,2  weeks,6/10/2009,Vistaril
158, 2, anxiety in place of klonopin,upset stomach and slight diarrhea_ other times nausea_ other times vomiting,I was given vistaril b/c my dr. thought that klonopin wasn't good for my intractable depression (turns out that klonopin can cause depression and I could have saved 5 years of my life if the drs. told me this and I would have never started on a med roller-coaster of anti-depressants_ antipsychotics_ etc to help depression).  Anyhow_ vistaril worked for anxiety to calm me down and didn't have much sedation to it but I was used to klonopin so maybe I just didn't notice sedation.  It wasn't as strong as klonopin but did help.  I can't tolerate it b/c lucky me my body doesn't like it but my brain did.  I gave it a 2 b/c of the side effects.,F,36,4  days,6/4/2009,Vistaril

160, 1, Anxiety/Panic Attacks,Sleepiness & extreme hunger.,This med did nothing for my anxiety except made me sleepy. I honstely felt like I took 4 tylenol pm pills_ and  the hunger it gave me was crazy. This is the first time and last time I will take this. If I continued I would probably gain 100lbs!,F,28,1  days,5/16/2009,Vistaril
161, 5, Anxiety/Depression,Slightly drowsy but not so bad that it's interfering with anything I want to do.,"I was prescribed this along with Lexapro for depression and anxiety. The anxiety is new for me and started as a result of my marriage failing_ and beginning divorce proceedings. I should mention that I'm a recovering heroin addict who is on 130mg of Methadone and 30mg of Adderall daily (for the past 2 years) so that will obviously have an affect on the way the Vistaril effects me. I had a pretty noticeable reduction in my level of anxiety and muscle tightness the very 1st day. I'm hoping that this good response lasts and that once the Lexapro has a chance to build up in my system to its therapeutic levels that I will only continue to feel better. Since I'm an addict my doctor obviously didn't want to prescribe another addictive medication and I'm usually skeptical about ""non-narc"" drugs since I've always had a warped view that ""the stronger the drug the better""_ but I've never been happier to be wrong. This has worked great and I'm so thankful that it's not another addictive substance that I have to worry about kicking one day_ if necessary.",F,34,1  weeks,4/22/2009,Vistaril
162, 5, anxiety,none,Love it!  Dr had put me on Cymbalta 30mg first_ but when I called in due to a new panic attack at work two weeks into Cymbalta_ his partner replaced the Cymbalta with Vistaril.  Not only has it calmed me (and the pains anxiety brings)_ it took away ALL my seasonal allergy symptoms.  Plus it reduced my appetite...I'm a stress eater so more calm = less eating.  I now have my life back plus I can breathe!,F,49,15  days,4/8/2009,Vistaril
163, 5, insomnia_ anxiety,a little hung-over early next morning at 50 mg. nothing else,this is a little known treasure in treatment of anxiety and insomnia. i've tried all the popular meds and vistaril is gently calming and cheap as dirt. no side effects but dry mouth and slightly harder to get out of bed. try it before klonopin_ which can cause depression. really_ vistaril (atarax) is worth a try.,F,48,2  years,4/2/2009,Vistaril
164, 3, Anxiety_ Sleep-Aid,Experienced Extreme temperature fluctuations with daily fevers ranging from 100.4 - 103.1,It helped with heart palpitations_ chest pains from panic_ and anxiety attacks but didn't help as a sleep aid at all,M,29,7  weeks,3/16/2009,Vistaril

167, 4, general anxiety disorder,worst side effect was sleepiness but I can still function well enough to continue taking it,I've been taking Lexapro for a week for anxiety and depression and was given Vistaril to take to help in the meantime.  I was taking Ativan for a couple of years_ only as needed_ and was worried about becoming addicted.  The Vistaril works fairly well and does give me a feeling of calmness.  It also helps somewhat with the heart palpitations that come from stress/anxiety.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from anxiety/depression/stress related problems.,F,44,2  weeks,12/29/2008,Vistaril
168, 4, anxiety and insomnia,don't think i had any just felt tired,Worked good the first couple times but seem to loose effect after awhile.  But i feel this is a far better med to be given for anxiety and stress.  Is not addicting like benzo's.,M,24,1  months,11/29/2008Email,Vistaril

I believe they may have started from my smoking addiction. I have been quit smoking for going on two weeks and I believe all my medical issues will be resolved after my body adjusts to everything and clears itself out.,F,20,3  weeks,11/17/2008,Vistaril

I was told that i was able to do what was asked and eventually i could move normally.  I would not reccomend this as a perminant treatment for FMS but when an extream case comes and you are conservitive about the meds that are given_ i would say yes. but only in rare cases.,F,44,1  times,10/11/2008,Vistaril

172, 5, Anxiety,none,I was put on Vistaril 25 mg 3x a day several days ago. I will take it temporarily as a job loss is causing tremendous anxiety. I was afraid to try it because I was completely knocked out by Klonopin I needed to take several years ago. I helps_ but in a very gentle way. I still feel a bit anxious_ but I'm not snapping at people and crying for no reason. You can just kind of feel your brain relaxing a bit_ but without being sleepy.

I was rushed to the hospital during the first trimester of my pregnancy. Within 5 or 10 minutes after receiving it_ I felt absolutely wonderful! After almost 3 months of being ill_I was able to finally eat_ sleep and feel close to being normal again.I don't know why_ but my doctor did not prescribe it for me again but switched to something else.,F,47,1  days,3/3/2008,Vistaril

182, 1, anxiety,"BLURRED vision_ WEIGHT gain_ ""FLASHES/BURSTS"" of white light in my vision_ APPETITE increase_ LOSS OF MENSTRUAL PERIOD FOR 7 MONTHS!","I felt no different_ but I was persuaded to continue taking it and have suffered GREATLY. I took this medicine and in the meanwhile gained near 25lbs_ had no MENSTRUAL PERIOD the entire time!_ blurred vision to the point that I thought I would need glasses_ odd ""flashes"" or bursts of light that would come out of nowhere_ and a HUGE appetite which Im sure I can blame the 25lbs for! I think the hardest for me is the weight gain and the loss of periods. I know Vistaril is what made me lose my periods. I believe this because when I ran out and didnt take it I started my period within a week_ which was about how long it takes to get out of your system! I have now switched to Buspar and am just thankful to have my vision and menstrual periods back. Im sure I will lose the weight and hopefully these ""FLASHES/BURSTS"" of white light will go away too!",F,25,7  months,9/18/2007,Vistaril
183, 1, Anxiety.,If anything_ it may have made me bipolar.,Although I'm 18_ my doctor & my dad insisted they be in the room together_ not letting me do any talking. My dad knows nearly NOTHING about me_ yet he told my doctor to prescribe this. Of course_ he agreed right away_ & I'd get constantly scolded any time I resisted taking it.,F,18,2  months,7/29/2007Email,Vistaril
184, 5, alcohol withdrawal/anxiety,on occasion makes me very sleepy,a fantastic med in my opinion. it should be used more in place of benzos. for mild alcohol withdrawal it helps enormously across the board-calms the shakes_ helps you rest and sleep_ and has powerful anti-nausea/anti-emetic properties which is just what you need. loosens up the stranglehold of obsessive thoughts about booze. works fast_ non-addicting_ no memory probs-try it before xanax people!,M,42,4  months,7/12/2007,Vistaril

186, 2, anxiety SAD,Drowsiness for the first 3 days. Sexual climax problems.,This stuff didn't work much for anxiety. I think it's supposed to make you not sweat and stuff when you have anxiety and that worked. But it did nothing for my over worked brain that never stops worrying when I am in public or attemting small talk.,M,25,2  weeks,5/4/2007,Vistaril
187, 3, OCD Anxiety Before Sleep/Insomnia,Initially_ stomach upset.  That went away in  a few days.  The feeling of calm others described set in quickly_ and helped me  rest for about a week... then it completely stopped having any effect on me.  Felt very tired in the mornings as well_  but since I have chronic insomnia and  slept_ it was a small price to pay.,Started on 50 mg. after trazadone stopped working for me to sleep. Worked nicely for about a week_ then completely stopped.  I just tried 100  mg. last night hesitantly and was tossing & turning all night.  Now I feel like a freight train rolled over me.,F,30,14  days,5/3/2007,Vistaril
188, 3, panic/anxiety,I have not started taking this yet_tonight will be the first night_ but I am satisfied with what I have heard from others who are currently taking it. I do have to say I am not a fan of taking medications!,,F,32,1  days,4/26/2007,Vistaril
189, 5, Anxiety_ paranoia_ sleep aid,Sleepiness (which is a GOOD thing).,I was prescribed Vistaril to be taken as needed for any paranoia or panic attacks I may have_ and also advised by my psychiatrist to take it as a sleep aid_ as Zoloft_ in addition to saving my life_ wired me up too much to sleep. It does the job.,F,31,3  days,4/20/2007,Vistaril
190, 4, Anxiety,Extreme Drowsiness,My doctor prescribed this for me as an alternative to Klonopin during anxiety attacks. I have the occassional anxiety/panic attack and wanted something a little lighter than the Klonopin to take. (I am not on any type of daily medication for my symptoms...i.e. Lexapro..etc)  She also said that this dissolves in the stomach more rapidly than the other RX_ thus making the effects kick in sooner. This really does the trick for me. My only complaint is that an hour or so after taking this_ I will be knocked out! I would definitely recommend this.,F,24,6  months,4/9/2007,Vistaril
191, 5, Interstitial Cystitis,Makes me a drowsy so I take it before bedtime and it helps me sleep well through the night. I take 25mg.,This drug is an antihistamine which supposedly helps with mast cell degeneration in the bladder. I'm not sure exactly how it works but I know it does work for me. My painful bladder symptoms improved a lot after taking it.,F,49,1  years,3/19/2007,Vistaril
192, 4, For anxiety,"Well_ I've only been on it for two days. I immediately felt the effects of less and then VERY little anxiety_ but I was too sedated and ""out there"" to go to work. I called my doctor and she changed my dosage from 50 mg tablet every eight hours as needed to 25 mg. Today I am at work and_ while I am definitely a little bit groggy_ a sip of coffee here and there helps. Overall_ a great drug.",Has anyone had nosebleeds?,F,27,2  days,2/20/2007Email,Vistaril

194, 5, Panic Attacks & OCD anxiety,I finally got some sleep!!!  Only side effects are slight sedation with light euphoric feeling.,I was having such bad substance abuse withdrawals I was having BAD panic attacks and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  The OCD was so bad that I was in a constant state of Panic.  Once I was put on Vistaril_ it worked tremendously and helped until the Zoloft kicked in.  Absolutely Miracle Drug.

197, 4, anxiety/panic_ nervousness_ GAD,few side effects.  Included some sedation especially when starting.  Usually goes away with time.  Also had dry mouth.  Thats about it.  I take 50-100 mg as needed.,This is one of the only psychotrophic drugs I've taken that I considered a safe drug.  Vistaril is very mild but fairly effective.  It's also good for allergies and itching.  Also will relieve nausea if you're experiencing it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has anxiety/panic.  Vistaril is good at preventing panic and shakiness.  Can also work for insomnia.  It's also approved to treat alcohol withdrawal.,M,19,2  years,10/31/2006,Vistaril
198, 5, Panic Attacks/ nervousness/ anxiety,I only take 25mg when I am having extreme or mild anxiety.  I do not take it everyday on a regular basis.  It seems to work very well within 30 minutes. I also sleep very very well on it.  I also take 100mg of Zoloft for the panic attacks.  I like the Vistaril since i have a history of drug abuse and it is non addictive.  But_ If i were to have a severe panic attack_ only Xanax or something stronger can help so i keep those on hand just in case.  But_ for anyone who suffers from mild to extreme anxiety and is looking for something non addictive_ then I would definetly recommend the Vistaril.,,F,28,10  months,10/27/2006Email,Vistaril
199, 5, Severe anxiety,slight drowsiness_ but more of a calm_ relaxed feeling,I can credit Vistaril for giving me my life back.

I can't recommend this medication enough. It's my godsend. Honestly_ it's a miracle.

201, 1, anxiety,Did not care about anything. Did not remember doing things from one minute to the next. Found myself pulling into my driveway and wondering where I had gone. That sort of thing.,They prescribed this stuff to me because I supposedly was suffering from anxiety. I was having chest pain_ and I guess I freaked out from that_ and it made my heart rate shoot up. In short_ I went to the ER and they pretty much told me I was crazy_ prescribed me the Vistaril and sent me on my way. It messed with my mind a great deal and made me feel like I was going insane. And by the way_ I went back to the ER and it turns out I've had bronchitis which accounts for the chest pain and trouble breathing.  SO I didn't even need the stupid Vistaril.,F,21,6  days,8/5/2006,Vistaril
202, 5, anaphylactic reactions/ cronic hive,Will sleep for about 13 hours after taking_ but it def. beats passing out from a reaction.  i guess the sleep lets the body slow down or something.,I had cronic hives and swelling for 9 months straight.  nothing worked_ until my allergist put me on 4 diff. meds (including this one) that worked together to stop the reactions. Now_ I'm through with hives and still take it for anaphylactic reactions that would otherwise end up in a visit to the emergency room!,F,22,1.5  years,6/8/2006,Vistaril

Um the type sedation was kindof calming however. and got lots of sleep. too much sleep though.. and not practical med for anxiety in my opinion...

210, 1, seizure activity/anxiety,I had a hard time with this shot_ & would never take it again.  I became EXTREMELY irritable and it took several hours for me to go to sleep...almost like I had the OPPOSITE reaction to what it was supposed to do...basically_ I came unglued.,DR told me there would be no side effects_ even though I told her that I tend to have adverse reactions to meds.  After researching more on the internet about it_ I found out there ARE side effects.  Make sure your DR informs you of all side effects of this drug!
