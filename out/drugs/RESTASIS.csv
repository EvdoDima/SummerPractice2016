0, 1, Severe Dry Eye,Severe headache like my head is splitting open. I have migraines but this is totally different_ daily within 30 minutes of instilling drops_ otc pain meds will not get rid of this headache. Confusion and blurry vision_ these could be the result of the severity of the headache. Neck pain_ tightness in my neck_ pain in my ears_ sinus pressure_ slight post nasal drip_ nosebleeds_ feeling of pressure or swelling around eyes and in cheek bones. I realize that all of these are symptoms of sinusitis but I have no real symptoms of sinus infection_ just the pain. Noted a continuous upward climb in my blood sugar_ and abnormally high spikes_ type 2 diabetic on an insulin pump_ I maintain an awesome blood glucose average of 98 and an A1C of 5.6 very tight control so this was very alarming to me_ have had blood sugar spikes over 200 since starting restasis 1 month ago_ this is absolutely unacceptable. The only change to my routine has been this medication! Also_ stopped using the restasis over the,Will never try again_ not worth this pain and absolutely not worth any risk to my health where my blood sugar is concerned_ kidney failure_ heart failure_ other diabetic complications are much worse than dry eye.

3, 1, Dry eye and to help other eye issue,I was experiencing head aches.  I normally do not have that problem.  Additionally I felt a need to clear my throat more often and would sometimes loose my voice.  As soon as I realized it might be from the meds I found this web site.  I discontinued Restasis and by the next day I felt great and the symptoms were gone!  It did help the dry eyes_ but not worth the side effects!,This seems a dangerous medication.

85, 1, Dry Eye,Eye_ head_ gum and ear pressure pain on left side.  Burning in eyes and redness of eyes.,I have been using Restasis for over 8 years off and on. It worked miracles in the beginning.  I stopped the medicine last summer_ because I felt so great but my dry eye came on full force_ worse than ever.  Immediately I went back on the medicine_ per doctor's order.   He said my eyes were extremely dry and to not stop the restasis or I would have to get the plugs.  So I started back up_ but the pain got worse from that point on and never stopped. My left eye had blood in it_ twice for an entire week.   My eye doctor saw a little improvement but can't help with the pressure pain so he referred me out.   I saw a million doctors and my dentist_ they pass me around.  I did CT Scans and MRI's_ and nothing.  Sinus and brain clear.  No cavities.  They think I am crazy.  So now it's been over a year with this pain and my eyes feel dry as can be_ I am confused and frustrated.   Then_ all of a sudden it hit me to google side effects_ so I did but nothing appeared abnormal.  I was looking on the restasis web site though.

Throat and nose feel restricted/ swollen. Symptoms improved after 1 week discontinuing    drops. A second attempt a few weeks later resulted in same symptoms- sore throat actually worsened and dry mouth intensified. Negative outweighed positive for me.

About 50% of the time it stings a bit when I put it in and for a few minutes afterwards.  I don't really mind that though because I have severe eye allergies and the burning/stinging is very minor compared to the intense itching I used to get during grass season.

174, 2, dry eyes,I experienced little benefit after 4 weeks of daily use.  My eyelids began to become red_ itchy and irritated.  I had to stop using Restasis due to inflamed eyelids.  My dry eye condition responds best to over the counter eye lubricant drops. As long as I keep my eyes *marinated* several times a day with inexpensive lubricants_ I feel better. I spend 9-10 hours a day using the computer_ and probably don't blink enough when I am concentrating on work.,,F,46,6  weeks,10/19/2008,Restasis

177, 3, chronic dry eye,Temporary eye irritation immediately after drops administered; understand that medication must be used for several weeks before results are noticed,Medication is extremely expensive and unless results are exceptional_ I will not refill RX.

179, 4, sjogrens syndrome,stinging for a few minutes after I take the drop (2x a day),Why do they make you waste half the liquid in the sealed container each time you use it? and it is very expensive  Otherwise good stuff...nothing else works anyway.,F,43,4  years,2/5/2008,Restasis
180, 3, dry eyes - lasik + maoi,some burning_ which usually goes away fairly quickly.  not as effective as i had hoped_ but better than nothing.,i started having problems with dry eyes after my lasik procedure_ mostly waking up with painful/dry/itchy eyes after sleeping all night_ but after a month or two it was manageable with artificial tears.  a few months after i started taking emsam (the maoi patch_ for depression)_ the dryness got worse - i woke up a few times with my eyes so dry that my eyelid was literally stuck closed_ and a few times felt like it ripped off the surface of my eye if i opened it suddenly.  after about 8 weeks on the drops_ i was back to the pre-maoi levels_ and i'm now able to manage the dryness with tears again (no more waking up with eyes stuck closed).,F,27,6  months,1/22/2008Email,Restasis
