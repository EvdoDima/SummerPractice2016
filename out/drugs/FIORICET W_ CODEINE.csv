0, 5, Chronic muscle tension headaches,Constipation,Very effective for relief of chronic moderate muscle tension headaches caused by whiplash auto accidents,M,65,10  years,7/17/2016Email,Fioricet w/ codeine
1, 5, chronic migraine_ tension headache,At first energetic and talkative_ but now no obvious side effects since I've been taking for a few years. I can only take one at a time_ max 2 in a day.,I generally take one pill_ once a day and two if my headache increases. I have a number of health issues and this seems to help significantly with my overall well being. I never take more than 30 pills in a month. It is the only medication that does not give me a rebound headache and in all honesty has helped me become more sociable and at ease. I can see how people could become addictive and abuse this medication but because I am hypersensitive to caffeine_ it is self limiting in that I can take a max of 2 for a really bad migraine. I've been on much stronger pain killers and this is by far the most effective with the fewest side effects only if taken in limited amounts. Combined with imitrex this works very very well and eliminates the unpleasant side effects of imitrex.,F,44,3  years1-2 1X D,5/4/2016Email,Fioricet w/ codeine

5, 5, migraine / tension headaches,I have had absolutely none and I have taken this medication for years.,I had my first migraine in 1982. I suffered with these having to go to emergency rooms and even being admitted for dehydration and severe pain vomiting.  After my family dr tried everything. ..he started me on this fioricet with codiene.  It is a miracle drug for me. I take it on a daily basis and I keep my headaches under control.  I get no high from this medication.  It is for the sole purpose of controlling my headaches.  I find doctors want to bulk on this medication.  I do not drink...I do not smoke... however I have to have this medication to be a functional human being. I have worked all my life and raised two sons.  It is the ONLY medication that keeps me being a human. I would like to say the the medical profession....it may be an older medication. ..but for people like me that have tried it all it works great and it has kept me put of the hospital and at my full time job and to be a mother and now a great functioning grandmother.  Please....it u have a patient that has tried it all....let let try this medication and have a functional life.,F,56,10  years30 mg,4/29/2015Email,Fioricet w/ codeine
6, 3, Migraines,Nausea/vomiting if taken w/out food,I have taken this medication for years.  Only take when I get a migraine.  Sometimes I won't get a migraine for months at a time.  Other times I will get several within a short time span.  Fioricet helps somewhat_ it dulls the migraine_ but doesn't eliminate it.  I don't understand the people saying it is addictive.  I get no buzz_ no high from it_ and I am a lightweight.  I do not even drink.  It helps somewhat_ but think it could be better.,F,40,5  years 1X AN,10/2/2011,Fioricet w/ codeine

9, 5, Migraine,Gets rid of my migraine!!!!,I've had migraines since I was 16 yo. I've tried everything. I've been on beta-blockers to help prevent them. This is the only thing that has ever gotten rid of mymigraine within an hour to hour 1/2. I take 1-2 Caps ever 4-6 hrs as needed. It doesn't make me feel intoxicated in any way. It just does it's job. I do take excedrine migraine first then I take this if it doesn't work. My migraines are debilitating to the point all noise and light kills me. I puke all day and just lay there in misery. This is a wonderful drug!,F,27,  1X AN,10/14/2010,Fioricet w/ codeine

I have been taking Lortab 10 6times a day for 7 yrs and it worked up til this year . my Dr. switched me to this medication and it sucks when compaired to the lortab. Ive had to go buy medication off the street to get me buy until I cld get a different type of pain medicine. This medication made me very drunk but it didnt help any of my pain. I had a very bad headache and woke up with the worse hangover. I didnt like this medicine at all.

12, 5, Chronic chest cramps from stress,Drowsiness_ Dry mouth,I was dealing with cramps in my chest wall brought on by stress and over-working_ and my doctor prescribed this instead of a muscle relaxer. Even though its used mainly for migraines_ it worked wonders. The cramps stopped and the pain and soreness it caused stopped also. I can see how this drug can be very addicting though_ so it's best to use it sparingly.,M,22,2  months 2X D,4/17/2010,Fioricet w/ codeine
13, 1, Migraine headaches,I starting using Fioricet w/codeine in 2006 for migraines.  I would take one every couple of weeks for migraines.  I enjoyed the 'high' I would get when I took it_ so I started taking more and more and everyday.  By 2009_ I was up to 20-30 pills a DAY!  I felt great all day long and then I would come home from work and sleep for hours and yell at my kids if they wouldn't leave me alone.  The medication made me very irritable. In 2009 I was in a major car accident while on the medication and almost died. I was in coma_ had a feeding tube and broke over 10 bones - not including all the internal damage.   I don't remember a good portion of 2008-2009 while I was taking the Fioricet really bad. I obtained a print-out from my pharmacy to see how much I had really taken- turns out I had been prescribed over 1_800 pills in a 6 month time frame - WOW_ that's crazy. Doctor shopping obviously worked for me. So_ I have been sober for over a year now and feel SO much better.If you NEED this and t,,F,37,3  years40 mg 10X O,3/26/2010,Fioricet w/ codeine
14, 5, Very Bad Headaches,Dry Mouth_ constipation,I have had very bad headaches since July 2009. this is the only medicine that has helped me. I take it as perscribed but it takes my headache away right away. Just dont overtake it.,F,29,4  months,1/30/2010,Fioricet w/ codeine
15, 4, Headaches,Consipation_ Sleepiness_ reduced sex drive_ stuffy nose_ memory loss_ reduced inhibitions in social settings_ overeating_ dependency_ very productive in short spurts_ overcommitment when feeling the buzz_,It works great on headaches! Other body pain as well. It is like a lubricant to the joints. The most I have ever taken in one day is 6 pills. This is way too much. If I take more than two then it is just the dependency driving me. It was not unusual for me to run out of pills before my next perscription was due. My doctor and I have an honest relationship about my dependency on this drug. I have stopped taking it on several occasions because I cannot stand to be mastered by a pill - longest stint without it was 8 months so it can be done. At the same time_ when I get a script for anything else but Fioricet it simply doesn't work. Truth is my headaches have been gone for years. I like the med for the overall relief of body aches and pains of any kind as well as a feeling of reduced stress and increased confidence. It also helps me with decreased urine flow (Prostate) - I can go like a race-horse when taking Fioricet! I'm not sure what I will do long-term. I'd like to stop because I do not need it; however_ most of the time I want it. It feels good to admit these things if for no other reason than to say it to people who might understand what I'm describing. If you can stay off any medication_ do it. If you can keep your dosage to 1-2 pills per day you will be fine. One suggestion: let a spouse or friend help you be accountable for your use of this medication.,M,46,10  years,1/24/2010Email,Fioricet w/ codeine

17, 5, Migraines_ headaches_ general pain,Some jumpiness,This is the only medication that actually worked on my headaches and for years I would take 1 or 2 only when needed.  There were  some other medical problems with a lot of pain_ and after I was ok and didn't need stronger medication_ I figured I could use fioricet w/codeine as my all-purpose pain medication.  I must admit that for over a year my tolerance has increased and I now must take at least three a day at the same time.  Frankly_ I can't figure out whether I really need it or not.  I want to taper off and think my doctor is about to cut me off_ but I can't seem to wind down or don't know how to do safely (doctor vague on this).  Has anyone successfully tapered off?  How and what did you experience.  I still think it is a great medication_ when used properly but I am pretty sure I am dependent_ and very concerned.  Thanks for any specific suggestions.,F,59,9  years,9/22/2009,Fioricet w/ codeine
18, 5, headaches and back pain,only positive side effects----unless taking too much.  Then I get rebound headaches_ but being sensible works wonders.  I don't know of any other drug that works as well for me.,I have arthritis and back problems.  I have tried other meds such as percocet_ vicodin_ etc.  the fioricent w/ codeine has been as effective_ if not more_ than the other drugs.  I have been taking this drug for nearly 40 years and don't find that I have to take more as the years go on.  usually one a day will do the trick.,F,67,40  years,7/20/2009,Fioricet w/ codeine
19, 5, chronic headaches,thirst_ euphoria_ increased productivity_ talkativeness_ complete lack of social anxiety_ slight stomach pain_ drowsiness after a few hours_ increased appetite,fioricet with codeine is almost like a wonder drug.  however_ i have mixed feelings about it as i have recently suspected that i have some dependency on it.  i have had chronic headaches since i was 19 and although i have had migraine rxs_ neurology treatments_ chiropractic alignments_ antidepressant rxs_ epilepsy rxs_ herbal treatments_ acupuncture therapy_ massages_ and went on a vegan diet--nothing seems to make my headaches go away--except for fioricet.  the most i ever took in 1 day was 2 pills.  i admit to having abused the drug by taking it with alcohol.  i have been off the drug for 5 days now and have had low-grade headaches almost each day_ i feel unmotivated and a little depressed.  i'm trying to go without it as long as possible but with headaches nearly every day now_ i have been getting very little done this week.  if it's the only thing that makes my headaches go away_ should i continue to use it with possible dependancy_ or is it better to tolerate the headache pain to,F,27,2  years,12/12/2008,Fioricet w/ codeine

21, 3, Migranes/tension headaches,Dizzyness_ confusion_ sleepiness,Be SO SO careful taking this drug...it can work and has worked well for me-depending on the type of HA I have_ but is also incredibly habit forming.  If you can take something else-do it.  If you have to take this drug-do so with care.  I no longer use it because I struggled with addiction to it.  Also-prolonged use/overuse of any Tylenol product will cause kindey damage.  You can get through a migraine but dialysis is a little tougher.  A good neuro can provide some better options.,F,41,10  months,10/14/2008,Fioricet w/ codeine

But_ your body needs more and more as time goes on. Unfortunately_ I am in the process_ after 2 years_ of trying to get off of this_ with marked withdrawl symptoms and rebound headaches. If you can find a non- narcotic to relieve your headaches_ I would recommend it. You never see the addiction coming_ but your body gets used to having it in your system_ and it is hell getting off of it.",Would appreciate anyone else's experiences with medicine that worked to releieve severe migranes (non addictive).

23, 5, Headaches,Just don't take them to regularly_ can get rebounds if you're not careful_ and because they make you feel kind of good_ there is obviousely some potential for abuse.  Bottom line_ take them when you need them_ not all the time.,This is a great medication.  I get headaches so bad sometimes its completely crippling_ I can't do anything.  Some one I know gave me a couple of Fioricet for a particularly bad one_ and BAM_ headache was totally gone.  The person below who says they don't work blah blah blah is not speaking for the majority.  They work_ and they work great.

There have been times when my migraine was so bad and I was vomiting_ then we would have to make a trip to the ER for injectables.  It has been a long time since I had to go to the ER and I am really happy with the Fioricet w/Codeine.  With the stronger drugs_ I would get really rebound headaches after they wore off_ especially w/ the Demerol injectable_ so obviously I no longer take it.  Thank God for the Fioricet w/Codeine.

29, 4, Migraine,Short Term - dry mouth_ slight euphoria_ constipation_impaired concentration_ nausea counteracted by gravolLong Term - Very concerned and can't seem to find any data,I have tried Imitrex_ zomig_ daily drugs etc and the only drug which provides relief with minimal side effects has been fiornal C 1/2.  The migraines vary in intensity sometimes with aura and sometimes without.  However I am very concerned with the long term side effects in my system and am always concerned about physical addiction.   My migraines are occurring 2 - 3 times a week and this is actually not too bad right now.  Having been on the drug for so long_ I don't think addiction has occurred as there has been prolonged periods without headaches and no problems.  However_ rebound headaches are a concern at times as well. I would love to hear from anyone with experience with this drug - positive and negative.,F,43,26  years,5/25/2007Email,Fioricet w/ codeine
30, 5, persistent headaches,Positive - this improves my mood_ social skills_ and mental acuity. I also have noticed an increase in motivation_ which leads to productivity.Negative - this has HIGH abuse potential if not kept in check. I have definitely noticed a rapidly developing tolerance. NOT an ideal medication for anyone who has frequently abused or currently abuses drugs of any sort.,"I have had daily debilitating headaches (sometimes they fit the criteria for migraines_ sometimes they do not) for a few months now - ever since I took Wellbutrin for a few days. OTC headache treatments have NEVER worked for me_ not even as a small child_ so this was a godsend! However_ tolerance to codeine escalates rather quickly_ and does not ever top out (it is an opiate). Barbiturates are also supposedly very addictive; I have not noticed any signs of physical addiction yet. I am trying to find another medicine that works for me because of the addiction/abuse potential. Unfortunately_ this is BY FAR the best thing I have found. Most other medications render me what I can only describe as ""narcoleptic"" for a few days_ and some are too intoxicating to be of any use.Note: the first week or so I took this_ it was also mildly intoxicating. However_ I got over it_ and no longer get such effects.",F,19,5  weeks,2/14/2007,Fioricet w/ codeine

32, 5, chronic headaches,constipation_ increased dosages,I think this medicine works wonders_ but over time you have to take more and more for it to work.  I tried to come off of the drug and the reboud headaches weren't like anything I have ever experienced.  I take two capsules two to three times daily depending on my headaches.  I have seen a neurologist for my headaches_ and they can't seem to find anything significantly wrong...weird_ I have chronic headaches for some reason.,F,27,8  months,6/27/2006Email,Fioricet w/ codeine
33, 5, migraines and back pain,sometimes a slight dry mouth and slightly sleepy feeling_ but for the most part I feel normal except for the passing headache.,I have been using this drug for years and its the only drug that doesn't bother me in an adverse way and works. I've had some severe drug allergies when I was younger_ so my motto is_ if it works_ stick with it.  Imitrex works on the headache_ but makes me feel strange in other ways and its very expensive.  I can't take Advil_ but I take Bayer Back and Body or Tylenol.  I have  back pain and arthritis so if I am feeling really bad I will use the Fioricet for that too. But I have a new doc and he is real hestitant about giving me the drug at all because he thinks I am addicted.  Thats scarey to me_ because I know I am not addicted_ and its no fun to endure the pain and have to worry about not having enough medicine.
