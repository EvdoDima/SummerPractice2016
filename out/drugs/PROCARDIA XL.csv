1, 2, pre eclampsia/ postpartum hbp,Headaches_ pressure in my upper abdomen/mid chest area which I now know from reading everyone else's reviews is acid reflux/gerd and I have been being treated for that since a week after I started taking procardia I have to take carafate now for acid reflux. Also experiencing weakness in legs and arms. Tingling in hands and feet.,I go to my Dr tomorrow and hoping she will take me off this medication so I feel normal again. Also if I'm late taking my procardia I develop a headache when I finally do take it.,F,29,6  weeks,5/9/2016,Procardia xl
2, 1, Hypertension during potential preg,Flushing_ warmth of lower legs/feet_ tingling burning face at first_ then progressed to severe palpitations/heart pounding/fast heart beat_ chest pain/tightness_ severe indigestion_ profound fatigue_ insomnia_ nausea causing weight loss_ and the worst_ extreme anxiety/feeling of impending doom/depression.,The side effects for me started as tolerable_ and then progressed to completely debilitating. Had to go on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds because I thought I had developed a severe panic disorder. I became a different_ non functioning person on this drug. After being taken off_ I was back to normal_ free from all side effects_ within 3 days. The potential side effects of this drug are very scary to experience.,F,31,5  months60mg,2/19/2016,Procardia xl
3, 3, High blood pressure,Swollen ankles_ depression_ anxiety_  anger problems_acid reflux and dizziness,When I first started taking this I had no problems. 3 years ago after I had my second child that's when I started having more problems.

5, 1, blood pressure high,"First off. I read through everyone's comments because I wanted to know did I have similar symptoms and a lot of them I did. I have been looking for answers about this medication to find out is it still effective after years on it;and can it raise your blood pressure or stop working after years on it. I have developed symptoms such as anxiety_ anger issues where I get upset to the point I could rip someone's head off_ even though I can still control my anger. I have high heart rate_ always now and I notice it a lot of times when I am laying down. Shaky weak feeling sometimes and headaches a lot more than usual. I don't know if this medication increases my blood pressure or is it just not working anymore. I started taking this medication in ""03"" even though I wasn't taking it all the time like I needed too.I would bit recommend it just because I am not sure if it is causing me to have these symptoms or if it even works. I am too scared to take another medication but I will need to see a specialist about this soon.",If you guys have any more information about being on this medication for long periods of time and how it affects your body please let me know.,F,28,10  years60 mg xl,11/27/2014,Procardia xl
6, 1, post partum preeclampsia,At first I was prescribed 60 mg procardia Xl then my doctor added labetalol along with increasing the procardia to 90 Xl daily. At first the drug worked well but the longer I took it the worse the side effects became. The side effects are_ dizziness_ short of breath_ faint feeling when I stand up_ heaviness in my chest_headache_ depression_ anxiety_ nervousness_ and unusual fatigue.This medication feels like it is killing me_ when I miss a day I feel normal again and my blood pressure does not get any higher than 140/106_ although that is still hypertensive. It is not terribly high_ so I wonder how beneficial this medication really is for me ? I am glad that I made an appointment with a cardiac specialist to mange my blood pressure and hopefully take me off of this awful drug.,,F,42,6  weeks90,7/16/2014,Procardia xl
7, 1, High blood pressure,High Pules_ Fast heart rate,At first it worked great but over time Pules rate went higher and higher. So bad it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest. This stuff was not for me. If this happens to you tell your Dr. You want to try something eles. Fast heart rate is a side effect of this stuff.,M,33,6  months90 MG 1X D,5/18/2013Email,Procardia xl
8, 3, High blood pressure,Acid stomach; fatigue; constipation,I started taking Procardia XL after my cesarean. I had pregnancy-induced hypertension and my BP remained high after birth.  It seems to do pretty well at 30 MG to keep my BP at borderline.  I believe if I lost weight_ my BP would be at normal with the help of Procardia XL.  I had a burning in my stomach starting the day I started taking this_ so I have had to take a variety of acid reducers including Nexium_ Prevacid_ Prilosec_ and Zantac.  I have to take Procardia XL at night because it does make me tired.  I have also had to take stool softeners with it as it seems to cause a bit of constipation.  There are warnings on the insert about narrowing of the GI tract_ so I don't know if its more than constipation.,F,35,2  years30 MG 1X D,10/24/2011,Procardia xl
9, 2, hypertension,Redness_ fever_ and swelling of knees_ lower legs_ and feet. Never had this to happen before.,Doctor changed to a different medication.,F,32,8  days30mg 1X D,3/31/2011,Procardia xl
10, 2, HBP,30 MG dosage_ had some mild swelling for a couple of days. No effect on BP. Upped to 60 MG dosage in the second month. Within a few days experienced uncomfortable edema in feet. My migraines went from 4-5 per month to 10-11. I developed pain in my sternum that made it impossible for me to lie on my side in bed because of the pain. I originally attributed it to my fibromylagia_ but the pain went away within a few days of my doctor taking me off of this medication because of the swelling. I have also not had a full blown migraine since stopping this medication. I was taking a generic manufactured by Mylan.,This medication did not work for me at all. But I also recognize that people with positive experiences rarely post on an internet forum such as this_ which to me_ explains the largely negative ratings on many medications. I am by no means saying that my experience should keep you from taking this_ but rather educate yourself and be aware of potential side effects_ and discuss potential side effects with your doctor.,F,37,60  days60 MG 1X D,4/4/2010,Procardia xl
11, 1, High Blood Pressure,I had problems with being very violent and upset about everything. I felt very tired constantly. I had a problem with trying to hit someone with my car. I decided it was time to get off the crazy pills and move to Norvasc.,It is a horrible medication. My blood pressure didn't go down at all_ it actually went up because I was irritated 24/7. I do not recommend this medication to anyone.,M,19,6  months30mg 1X D,3/10/2010Email,Procardia xl

14, 1, hypertension,depression_ fatigue_ insomnia_ dizziness,Drug didn't do anything for hypertension_ very expensive_ Dr only kept increasing dose to 90mg. This stuff is worthless and the side effects are awful. They should take it off the market.,F,64,2  years,4/22/2009,Procardia xl

18, 3, Raynaud's,Extreme dizziness and exhaustion,It worked great for my Raynaud's.  I never imagined something could work so well.  BUT_ since I have normal blood pressure_ it lowered it way too low.  I was exhausted during the whole time I took it and got dizzy even turning my head.  I decided not to take it the next winter since the exhaustion never got better.,F,30,5  months,12/15/2007,Procardia xl

22, 1, Hypertension,Headache,Doctor said it might cause headaches and it did. One 30 mg dose gave me a headache for two days. Now I have always had a probelm with headaches (since adolesence). The beta blocker (atenolol) I have used for the last 25 years tended to suppress them. I was still using the atenolol when I took the procardia. Developed a severe headache within 3 hours.,M,51,1  days,4/8/2006,Procardia xl
23, 1, Hypertension-unknown cause,Horrible drug.  Made me a very crazy_ angry person. Normally people irritate me but I was overreacting like I never have before,Stopped taking it and over next 3 days became much calmer and less irratable.
