0, 2, bhp,sinus congestion_  no ejaculation at all weakening orgasm_  dizziness 2 hours after taking for about 4 hours_  much less sleep.  drops blood pressure too much to sports with high power_ high cardio demand -no strength no power,i stop using the pills 2 days before i play hockey.  also after 3 days off pill there is is complete ejaculation with solid orgasm.  If you can get away with hit take the top of the capsule and use half_ or go as long as you can without getting in bad shape-  in my case 4 days without is my limit as infection becomes a strong possibility.  if you go off for two weeks then all introductory side effects re appear when you start.  for me best deal is half capsule two - three days a week full capsule two-three days a week.  Some days none at all in order to play hockey.  if i have a monday game i take my last one on Friday.  It works better than when i was in my 20's possibly_ but if  u play high level sports or like sex_ it is a grim prognosis_ unless u are willing to and are able to play around with dosage and frequency.  By the way my doctor knows all this and he does not have a problem with it,M,59,8  months4 1X D,8/8/2016Email,Rapaflo
1, 4, BPH,Initial 8 mg dose/day was terrible. Headache & dizzy but improved urine flow. I decreased the dose to 4mg & only took at night. I increased to 8 mg/day over several weeks. Experienced minimal side effects along the way & have almost zero now @ 8 mg. retrograde ejaculation is disheartening. At 1st I thought it was no big deal because you still have an orgasm but after about a month I can say they're not quite as satisfying. The key for me to get the urinary benefit was to increase the dose slowly.,,M,62,2  months8,7/26/2016,Rapaflo
2, 1, urinary retention after surgery,Huge Purpura_ first on lower right arm then on upper_ one week later.  Right elbow bursa sac filled with fluid.  Stopped taking the drug.  The Purpura_ visible on my arm_ cleared up.  Enlarged elbow sac  remained.,After five more weeks_ with no reduction in enlarged elbow I went to an orthopedist who aspirated the bursa.  It was filled with 80cc of very bloody fluid.  Three days later he aspirated about 50cc.  The swelling has diminished by about 60%.  I experienced the more common side effects while taking Rapaflo_ which went away when I stopped taking it.  The Purpura_ which I believe filled my elbow bursa has persisted for over a month.,M,78,24  days8mg 1X D,4/23/2016,Rapaflo
3, 4, couldn't urinate,Can't ejaculate.,Works great so far. I can deal with the one side effect I am experiencing. I hope no others appear. Urinating is gooooood!!!!,M,61,7  days8 mg 1X D,3/5/2016,Rapaflo
4, 1, weak urination flow,Horrible congestion unable to sleep well.  Felt like I was getting the flu.  Though in one day of taking it I felt a strong flow when urinating and great erections.  However I have stopped taking because of the severe congestion and body pain.,I would not recommend this drug.  I'm tired because I couldn't get any sleep. The severe congestion and body aches made me sick.,M,53,1  days8mg 1X D,1/8/2016,Rapaflo
5, 1, To improve urine flow at night,Immediately stuffy nose_ back pain_ teeth pain_ headache_ dizzy_ snoring like a bull_ terrible sex because retrograde ejactulation.,Stopped taking it. Now I do not drink any liquids in the evening and not getting up to urinate. Still leftover side effects. Worst medicine ever!!!!,M,64,1  days8mg,12/4/2015,Rapaflo
6, 1, Slow stream after prostate biopsy,Retro ejaculating_  lower back pain_ congestion_ headache. About a 50% ability to get an erection.,"After 9 days_ I can urinate ""better""_ but I have no sex drive_ the dry_ discouraging orgasm_ and headaches. It just gives me a bunch of other things to worry about.  My urologist didn't warn me of any of these side effects. He gave me a 2 week course from his sample closet so I didn't even get the printed material from the pharmacy.  I feel like I went from being a sexually capable 50 year old man to a mere shadow of that overnight.",M,50,9  days8,10/21/2015Email,Rapaflo
7, 3, Prostatitis,Tiredness_ joint pain_ retrograde ejaculation_ lower back pain,I started taking rapaflo to treat prostatitis that I developed over the past few months as a result of a tightened muscle in my bladder. The pain urinating mostly subsided_ but being a runner I can't really put up with so much muscle fatigue_ and as a teenager I can't stand the problems ejaculating. Not a fan.,M,18,7  days8MG,8/22/2015Email,Rapaflo
8, 1, slow stream,50% less ejaculation feeling_ lower back muscles hurt all the way around to the sides of my stomach_ felt like I had flu symptoms_ I felt so bad I prayed to God to help me_ I always do that. This was so out of the ordinary for me_ the lower pain that is!,,M,61,2  days4mg 1X D,6/22/2015,Rapaflo
9, 2, BPH,Retrograde ejaculation. Treatment for BPH. Without it_ severe urination problems_ with it all but killed my sex life for both me and my wife. RF procedure is only option however the #1  drawback to that procedure is permanent retrograde ejaculation.,So in summary_ no real choice only more gambling! Flomax caused severe syncope and no ideas if it would cause same dry ejaculation issue or not. Seems that I am in a place with no options left except to choose a sex life or having to self catheterize to empty bladder. Anyone have any good advise?,M,59,3  years8 mg 1X D,3/24/2015Email,Rapaflo
10, 1, Weak urine stream,Definitely disrupts sexual performance,I found this medication to be ineffective for my need as well as inordinately expensive relative to competitive products.  I found ineptness in the marketer's response to their published discount offers_ even to contact by my urologist.  I think the product is over-hyped.  Be wise and try before you buy.,M,65,42  days8 MG 1X D,3/9/2015,Rapaflo

12, 1, Urine Retention,I developed extreme pain in my lower back muscles and joints and nasal congestion that affected my sleep. I also got worse as far as urgency and need to urinate small amounts several times per day. As soon as I quit taking this expensive medicine and returned to taking Doxazosin_ all of these side effects disappeared. Its very expensive Flomax_ beware.,Read this:http://www.theridgefieldpress.com/31954/say-no-to-rapaflo/,M,72,90  days8MG 1X D,12/12/2014,Rapaflo
13, 3, Enlarged prostate,Serious dizziness first day of use.  Retrograde ejaculation same day taking the meds.,It takes two days to clear the meds out so i can have a normal ejaculation.  This is the most difficult problem with this medication.  I have to stop taking it so I can have sex with my wife and then start it up again.,M,65,5  months30 MG 1X D,11/9/2014Email,Rapaflo
14, 1, enlarged prostate,Retrograde ejaculations_ dry orgasm,Rapaflo is a mixed bag of trouble.  A conundrum as it is_ without it I cannot urinate naturally_ with it my manhood is negated! My urologist says I will always have this condition if I want to urinate naturally.  This depresses me and I am suicidal.,M,73,90  days8 MG 1X D,8/8/2014Email,Rapaflo
15, 4, enlarged prostate -urine retention,I have been on and off the medication for the past three months . experienced leg cramps_ headaches_ severe congestion a couple of times a..a..these seem to come and go as you advance. Sleep much better_ less times up at time_ somewhat better flow. ejaculation is a problem. yes_ dizziness too_ but all pains have subsided and I will continue to take for a couple more months till I see the dr again. I did have some noticeable twitching in my chest_ then stopped for  a week. so far this time no twitching.... maybe just hard to get used to even in the limited dosage I have.,,M,58,60  days4mg 1X D,3/9/2014Email,Rapaflo
16, 2, enlarged prosate_ slow flow,Rapaflo had no side effects that I was aware of_ which was a good thing_ whereas Uroxatral had all kinds of nasty side effects for me.,Rapaflo did NOT help with the slow urine flow_ frequent nighttime urination_ or the agitation during unination.  waste of money for me and now that I am off it (3 weeks) the above issues seem to be even worse.  In the process of looking for a new med.,M,64,4  weeks8mg 1X D,11/21/2013,Rapaflo
17, 3, BPH,Extreme muscle and joint pain.  Started with lower legs_ now arms and hands.,Worked well for symptoms_ however if this is a side effect (not sure yet_ although pain started within a week or so of taking medication and has progressivly gotten worse) will have to stop soon.  Seeking expert advice.  Getting to the point where walking is extremely painful and difficult.,M,57,30  days8MG 1X D,11/11/2013Email,Rapaflo
18, 1, To help in urination,I had a stuffy nose_ fullness in my stomach_ headache_ dry mouth_ issues breathing while sleeping_ trouble sleeping_ some weakness and fatigue.  I only took it one time (8 mg.).  This was for help in urination in order to pass my remaining kidney stones.,I took this drug no more due to the side effects mentioned earlier.,M,51,1  days8 MG. 1X D,9/6/2013,Rapaflo
19, 1, BPH,Muscle pain_ muscle spasms_ joint ache_ tingling of nerves_ dry ejaculation.,I had been on Flomax for years and was getting a rapid heartbeat and palpitations from that along with some light-headed feelings_ so the doctor put me on Rapaflow_ which he said worked better. About a week after starting Rapaflo I started feeling weak in my left arm and leg. This progressed to tingling in my left leg and foot. Then I started getting muscle spasms and twitches in both arms and legs_ and then stiff painful muscles and an achy feeling like you get when you have the flu_ along with  some dizziness and totally dry ejaculation. I stopped taking the Rapalow and within a few days most of the symptoms had disappeared and I feel much better. It's been about a week now without taking it and I still have some mild muscle spasms_ but everything else is back to normal. Hopefully I will continue to get better.,M,50,60  days 1X D,8/12/2013Email,Rapaflo
20, 4, Weak urine flow,Tiredness. Retrograde ejaculation_ stuffy nose_ sore throat.,Very tired_ but getting a little better. Sore throat went away after 3 days. Stuffy nose much better after after 10 days. Retrograde ejaculation is weird_ but not intolerable. I was given samples to try and when the 14 days was up_ waited a day and found ejaculation returned to normal. Ease of urination continued for several more days. I'm working on a prescription refill (insurance wants me to try Flomax first - allergy to sulfa drugs_ so that's not happening). Planning to try taking every other day to see if that will minimize side effects.,M,58,14  days8mg 1X D,10/12/2012Email,Rapaflo
21, 4, BPH,Only side effect is retrograde ejaculation.,Great for urination difficulties caused by BPH.  Not too happy about retrograde ejaculation_ which is just plain weird.  I plan to ultimately get off this drug because of this unnatural side effect.,M,59,60  days8 MG 1X D,7/3/2012,Rapaflo

24, 4, bph,Loss of ejaculation with rapaflo_ which is a little less of a problem with flomax.,Both flomax & rapaflo very effective_ even on 1/2 dose. Experienced severe sinus & chest congestion with flomax; turns out was allergy to the sulfa component of flomax which rapaflo does not have. Flomax is now generic & a better & much cheaper choice provided u have no allergies to it & rapaflo side effects are not less than flomax.,M,66,45  days8 mg 1X D,2/16/2012Email,Rapaflo
25, 3, Recurrent urinary tract problems,The tiredness was bad_ especially for me with chronic fatigue.  More troublesome was inflamed sinuses and very stuffy nose for the entire time on the drug.  These were all side effects listed for the drug.,It worked within a couple of hours in improving my ability to urinate properly_ but I can't live with the side effects and will try to find something else.  To the first person who rated - if Rapaflo didn't cause you sinus problems_ Flomax probably won't either.,F,59,2  days8 1X D,1/8/2012Email,Rapaflo
26, 4, urinary symptoms,It definitely improved urine flow on the first day. I stopped using it after the fourth dose as no ejaculation occured at orgasm_ it was a weird feeling and my girlfriend missed it too.,My symptoms are not bad enough yet to miss the feeling of ejaculation but if they progress to the point of requiring medication I would definately use Rapaflo. I have read too many bad reviews of Flomax's stuffy or runny nose to try it.,M,61,4  days8 mg 1X D,10/1/2010,Rapaflo
27, 4, Urine Flow Problem,The only side effect that I have experienced is that I no longer ejaculate.  The feeling of ejaculation is about 50% of what it use to be.,This drug does not have the side effects of another drug that I was taking for my problem.  It works very fast...in 2 days or less.,M,71,4  months 1X D,4/23/2010Email,Rapaflo
