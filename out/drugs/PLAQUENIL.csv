I spoke with my pharm he instructed me to dc the plaquenil start benadryl and contact my rheum ASAP . Saw Rheum next day agreed with pharm on dc of plaq_ added prednisone_ said severe rash and definitely allergic to plaq. I was seeing some improvements while on med. Less pain in hip was definitely only positive lol.,Also had lots of nausea felt like a fibro flare very flu-y. I thought at the time it was just my body adjusting to the new med.

8, 3, SLE and RA,This is for the GENERIC: extreme nausea and vomitting to the point where taking Zofran to stop it did not help (and it normally ALWAYS works!). Insurance denied approval for brand name. I was able to identify 5 ingredients in the generic that is not in the name brand that could be causing the problem. Also_ any cut or wound I got became difficult to heal_ though rheumy said Plaq doesn't cause issues with this (my PCM disagrees).,"Besides the nausea/vomitting_ it was helping alleviate my symptoms far more than I realized. Though I still had fatigue_ it improved somewhat_ the pain in my joints had decreased significantly_ and I had these weird ""nodules"" that used to pop up under the skin of my arms and legs that disappeared. Getting eye exams every 6 months to check for Plaq toxicity...so far so good.",F,42,9  months200 MG 2X D,4/13/2016Email,Plaquenil

Twice in one month of taking this poison_ I have awoken to itchiness and hives that spread all over my body.  The rheumy suggested that I take antihistamine everyday along with the Plaquenil to control the reaction_ but it happened again and it's far worse than before.

21, 5, Discoid lupus_ sojrens,"Love this relatively inexpensive drug. Because of my prescription coverage I take generic_ so I cannot compare it to the name brand. It has been a literal ""put me back into life without severe pain"" medicine. It has almost completely removed the pain in my feet and joints and kept my flare ups at bay. The doctor added 5 mg of prednisone a day 5 months ago for swelling of my joints. The 2 medications are working HOWEVER I have had easily bruising and any little cut scrape bleeds like I have been gashed. Will have the doctor reevaluate my dosage of plaquinel in October to possibly ease the side effects.",,F,55,2  years400 mg a d,9/27/2015,Plaquenil

I have elevated RA factor. My ankles_ wrists_ knuckles will get really intense arthritic pains if I miss the plaquenil. I have never taken the generic and hope I never have to. Another bonus to the plaquenil is that it thins my blood_ I guess? I have factor v leiden_ a blood clotting disorder and this lupus like autoimmune disease must also exacerbate the clotting issue because before plaquenil I had 7 ministrokes (TIA) btn 2010-2014 and since beginning plaquenil_ I have not had any!

24, 1, Amyopathic Dermatomyositis,Unusual strange emotions_ agitation_ insomnia_ fast heart rate during the middle of the night_ blurry vision.,My rheumatologist prescribed 400mg per day for me but I cut a 200mg pill in 4 pieces to see how I reacted to the drug before I started the full dose.  Boy_ was this drug awful.  The first day_ for an hour_ I felt mean - that I wanted to pick a fight with someone which is definitely not me.  The next day_ I felt euphoric and I had the desire to run out on the street and hug everyone I saw.  Thankfully_ I was able to control these emotions and not make a fool of myself.  If I had taken the full 400mg dose_ god knows what would have happened.  I switched to Methotrexate 7.5 mg per week with 2 mg. folic acid/day and I have very little in the way of side effects.  A few weeks after I stopped Plaquenil_ I met two people who had Lupus and had been on Plaquenil.  They both stopped the drug because of side effects that included anxiety_ extreme irritability_ being very emotional.  One of these people also had pressure build up behind her eyes which her doctor attributed to Plaquenil.,F,66,7  days50 mg 1X D,8/17/2015Email,Plaquenil
