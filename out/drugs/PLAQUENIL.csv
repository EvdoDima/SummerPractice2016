I spoke with my pharm he instructed me to dc the plaquenil start benadryl and contact my rheum ASAP . Saw Rheum next day agreed with pharm on dc of plaq_ added prednisone_ said severe rash and definitely allergic to plaq. I was seeing some improvements while on med. Less pain in hip was definitely only positive lol.,Also had lots of nausea felt like a fibro flare very flu-y. I thought at the time it was just my body adjusting to the new med.

8, 3, SLE and RA,This is for the GENERIC: extreme nausea and vomitting to the point where taking Zofran to stop it did not help (and it normally ALWAYS works!). Insurance denied approval for brand name. I was able to identify 5 ingredients in the generic that is not in the name brand that could be causing the problem. Also_ any cut or wound I got became difficult to heal_ though rheumy said Plaq doesn't cause issues with this (my PCM disagrees).,"Besides the nausea/vomitting_ it was helping alleviate my symptoms far more than I realized. Though I still had fatigue_ it improved somewhat_ the pain in my joints had decreased significantly_ and I had these weird ""nodules"" that used to pop up under the skin of my arms and legs that disappeared. Getting eye exams every 6 months to check for Plaq toxicity...so far so good.",F,42,9  months200 MG 2X D,4/13/2016Email,Plaquenil

Twice in one month of taking this poison_ I have awoken to itchiness and hives that spread all over my body.  The rheumy suggested that I take antihistamine everyday along with the Plaquenil to control the reaction_ but it happened again and it's far worse than before.

21, 5, Discoid lupus_ sojrens,"Love this relatively inexpensive drug. Because of my prescription coverage I take generic_ so I cannot compare it to the name brand. It has been a literal ""put me back into life without severe pain"" medicine. It has almost completely removed the pain in my feet and joints and kept my flare ups at bay. The doctor added 5 mg of prednisone a day 5 months ago for swelling of my joints. The 2 medications are working HOWEVER I have had easily bruising and any little cut scrape bleeds like I have been gashed. Will have the doctor reevaluate my dosage of plaquinel in October to possibly ease the side effects.",,F,55,2  years400 mg a d,9/27/2015,Plaquenil

I have elevated RA factor. My ankles_ wrists_ knuckles will get really intense arthritic pains if I miss the plaquenil. I have never taken the generic and hope I never have to. Another bonus to the plaquenil is that it thins my blood_ I guess? I have factor v leiden_ a blood clotting disorder and this lupus like autoimmune disease must also exacerbate the clotting issue because before plaquenil I had 7 ministrokes (TIA) btn 2010-2014 and since beginning plaquenil_ I have not had any!

24, 1, Amyopathic Dermatomyositis,Unusual strange emotions_ agitation_ insomnia_ fast heart rate during the middle of the night_ blurry vision.,My rheumatologist prescribed 400mg per day for me but I cut a 200mg pill in 4 pieces to see how I reacted to the drug before I started the full dose.  Boy_ was this drug awful.  The first day_ for an hour_ I felt mean - that I wanted to pick a fight with someone which is definitely not me.  The next day_ I felt euphoric and I had the desire to run out on the street and hug everyone I saw.  Thankfully_ I was able to control these emotions and not make a fool of myself.  If I had taken the full 400mg dose_ god knows what would have happened.  I switched to Methotrexate 7.5 mg per week with 2 mg. folic acid/day and I have very little in the way of side effects.  A few weeks after I stopped Plaquenil_ I met two people who had Lupus and had been on Plaquenil.  They both stopped the drug because of side effects that included anxiety_ extreme irritability_ being very emotional.

Started getting flu symptoms_ fevers_ swollen glands. Had extreme dizziness and extreme hair loss. I don't know if the hair loss was from the BCP that I started around the same time or the Plaquenil_ but it is copius hair loss. Very depressing. I quit the med because I didn't see a lot of improvement and I wanted to get rid of the awful dizziness and hair loss. If the hair loss continues then it is probably the pill.

Oncologists are scratching their heads because corresponding markers for suspect blood cancer are non-existent.

I take 4-5_000 units of Vitamin D_ 600-1_200 units of Calcium_ and 1-2_000 units of Vitamin C daily - I don't think those supplements would cause any swallowing problems.I was prescribed generic Plaquenil for a scalp condition that was attributed to discoid lupus in April 2012.  The scalp condition cleared up_ but my doctor wanted me to continue with the medication because I have very high ANA readings with no other  symptoms that indicate any systemic illness.  I had also developed wrist pain temporarily -- I was told to wear a wrist brace at night and the problem cleared up_ so maybe the wrist issue was not due to the medication.  I'm getting regular checkups by an opthamologist to monitor any vision changes_ but I feel like it might be starting to affect my vision_ although the opthamologist said there were no meaningful changes from my last checkup.

C are very low_ may be why I didn't tolerate this drug.After about 2 weeks I did notice a bit less joint pain & by the 3rd week it was very clearly starting to help (the rheumatologist said it could take 6 months for it to work_ but I'm VERY sensitive to many things & I did notice a change for the better for the joint pain until I got sick_ then it was far worse.The 4 rating on this site says_ ""This medicine helped""_ 3-""Somewhat Satisfied - this medicine helped somewhat""  yet a 2 says_ ""this medicine did not work to my satisfaction""_ thus my rating.This medicine worked for the RA_ yet because of the complications_ it clearly wasn't worth it for me.

Also got itching on legs that turned into severe ugly bruises about a month into taking meds and then went away until it happened again about a week ago. However I am on a few other meds and cannot say for sure it's the Plaquenil causing this.,Seems to be working great for me!  I also believe that I feel well due to my positive mind set and the fact that I am very active.  I've been at the other end of the spectrum before with negativity and depression and I see a world of difference!

I also take Ibuprofen 400mg TID_ Tramdol 100mg about every 4 hours_ Vitamin D supplement.  It changed my life.  I was in bad pain for about 8 years before this.  It took a little while for meds to kick in (3 months).  I lost 40 pounds ( but that was good) I was overweight.  I take my meds regular and on time.  If I get off schedule it does not work as well.  At bedtime_ I take 100mg of Tramadol_ 800mg Ibuprofen and I sleep like a baby.  I take the Plaquenil 200mg in the morning.,Take at the same time every day and keep schedule.

107, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis; Fibromyalgia,Diarrhea that lasted about a week; flatulence that was very bad for the first two weeks_ then tapered off and now is infrequent_ but uncontrolable; headache when first taken each day starting the second day for a week; stomach cramping;,I was told up front from my Rheumatologist that Plaquenil caused stomach cramping and bowel issues in the majority of the patients tested_ so I was aware of it when I started it. I was also told it could take up to three months to start working. I was in so much pain that I was willing to give it that amount of time if I would be at least partially pain free after the three months. Luckily it started working within the first week_ which I deemed worth the side effects I was having so long as they went way by the fourth week. They did_ I don't have the headaches or nausea now. I do have uncontrolable flatulence which can be unpleasant in social situations but is mostly silent and non odorous. My pain is quite a bit less_ I do still have flare ups and achiness when I squat_ stand_ sit or walk for long periods of time. My morning stiffness is lessened as well. Each person is affected differently by medications_ so you have to choose if the side effects are worth the outcome of the medication overall. For me they were_ but I understand many people do not like this drug and will tell others to not use it. If you have mild to moderate side effects_ I would suggest giving it a few weeks to see if there are benefits to taking it before you try another medication.,F,29,3  months200 2X D,1/14/2012Email,Plaquenil

I later became pregnant with my son and I was terrified knowing the condition of my health... The further along I became_ the better I felt as odd as it sounds. It seemed that my sickness went into remission. I had my energy back and my body didnt hurt half as bad. It was great. My son was born 5wks early and the hospital encouraged me to breastfeed. I still felt better while nursing until I stopped producing milk after about 6wks and all of my symptoms came back tenfold. Obviously there must have been certain horomones that played a role in my remission. I was baffled.  I was referred to a Rheumatologist a few wks ago and he ordered another blood test. My blood results showed the presence of antibodies ( ANA_ Histone autoabs_ U1RNP autoabs_ Rheum abs). Amongst other findings my neutrofils where low_ lymphocytes where high_ and eosinofils where high. Also_ the tourniquet was left on my arm the entire time and thats usually a no no when checking blood for certain things because it can cause inaccurate results. He said little about my results other than diagnosing lupus. I have had alot of symptoms of Sjogrens syndrome as well and severe dry skin all over_ dry mouth_ and dry eyes are just to name a few.

Dr. didn't believe me that it could be allergic reaction so he put me back on plaquenil for one more week_ this time at 400mg/day.  He thought it was lupus flare so I received very high pulse therapy treatment of medrol.  I was in hospital for a week_ I went home_ and it got worse.  I had to take 75 mg/day of prednisone.  The second week of taking this poison I began hearing voices and noticed I felt much much worse and this time was convinced_ despite all the doctors advice_ that it was a severe allergic reaction.  I had a skin biopsy done which confirmed it was an allergic reaction and not autoimmune related.  I have experienced terrible effects.  For almost 2 months all the skin on my body peeled off despite being on high level steroids and it also caused me to have a fast heart rate and feel nervous/irritable and shaky and have very dry eyes and high eye pressure.  BEcause of being on high level steroids I have experienced very bad side effects such as infections/moon face/weight gain_ etc. all that comes with prednisone.

After a few weeks these symptoms went away.,I have had great results with Plaquenil.  Before I went on it_ my hair was falling out dramatically from the roots. I couldn't touch my hair without coming away with a bunch. This started slowly 8 months ago but accelerated rapidly in the 3 months before I was diagnosed with lupus and started the medication. I was told that the Plaquenil would take 2 months to have any effect and I was not optimistic at first. But around the 7 week mark_ I became cautiously optimistic when my hair stopped falling out heavily in the shower and seemed to lessen its shedding upon combing and throughout the day. Around the 9th week_ my hair loss had completely stopped.  Now_ I can see that my hair is definitely growing back.  It's like a miracle and I just pray that the medicine does not stop working.

Generally_ I only have finger/wrist joint pain now when my hands are exposed to cold temperatures. Sadly_ it doesn't seem to be effective for my spinal osteoarthritis pain. I highly recommend it for finger/wrist osteoarthritis pain. Patients need to be careful about watching for vision changes while taking Plaquenil. Be sure to get your eyes check annually. Also be certain to tell your optometrist/opthamologist that you are taking Plaquenil_ so they can watch for vision changes.

The first thing I noticed was that I was less stiff in the morning.  Then I gradually saw improvement in my energy levels and my all around well-being.  I do see an optometrist every 6 months to check for vision changes.  So far all is well.  I am grateful that the drug is extremely affordable and I have not had any real side effects.  My rheumatologist explained that this is something I will have to take for the rest of my life.  I also take Levothyroxin for my Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and completed a round of prescription Viyamin D after initial diagnosis.  This is my second flare in 2 months. My doctor prescribes a two week dose of Prednisone and that seems to help. Since I am newly diagnosed I appreciate everyone's comments and suggestions.

158, 3, Osteoarthritis,This drug *did* help with my joint pain_ diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis as result of Ehler Danlos. Rheum suspects additional autoimmune disease_ but tested neg for Lupus. Initial gastrointestinal issues_ vomiting_ nausea. Like morning sickness all the time. Was on 400mg day at that point. VIVID_ epic length dreams. Exacerbation of OCD that was previously under control. Dosage stepped down to 200mg and moved from PM to AM to counteract dreams and OCD flares at night preventing sleep. AM dosage caused massive brain fog. As mother and full time psychology student this prevented me from performing to standard both academically and as a human. Last four weeks have been dealing with constant_ overwhelming anxiety_ huge upswing in OCD symptoms_ and worsening depression with suicidal ideation_ lack of focus and ability to stay on task.,Having gone off the drug for only two days_ I can report that I slept for a full five hours last night (miraculous!)_ my OCD symptoms have stepped back down_ and I'm looking at my behavior of only last week in disbelief. I'm not ruling this drug out yet_ but may need to combine it with an SSRI and strict monitoring. Would STRONGLY recommend that patients with anxiety disorders do not take this drug without discussion with a Psychiatrist first. Am much more cheerful today_ despite the fact that I'm in a lot of pain. (Psychosomatic? Seems unlikely the drug has cleared enough yet to cause remission of psychiatric symptoms and reoccurrance of physical.

185, 3, Undiff. Conn. Tissue Disorder - SLE,It's hard to say since I've had so many ailments since before and after I was diagnosed_ and I feel that my doctors did not correctly assess any of them. I was already having improperly diagnosed digestive problems_ which to my thinking may have been the first symptoms of UCTD/lupus. My rheumatologist has not confirmed it_ but 7 years later_ I am now suffering gastroparesis_ and my gastro-enterologist has finally confirmed that it is likely a symptom of my autoimmune disease. The only side effect I can directly attribute to the plaquenil is random bruising of my skin. I've always bruised easily_ but this was w/o cause. If there were bloating_ headache_ memory or painful side effects_ they were just in addition to the symptoms I was already having. At the time I started plaquenil_ I was in so much pain and unable to function that I was concurrently started on 15 mg of prednisone. I never got below 8 mg. of prednisone w/o my joints/nerves flaring up_ so I've never relied primarily on pla,All I can say is that w/ the combined prednisone and plaquenil... my joints lost their stiffness... the pain I do experience is intermittent and tolerable. I manage my pain w/ ibuprofen and vicodin as needed... usually not on a daily basis_ sometimes 3 times daily for the ibuprofen. I also soon after my diagnosis began using a low dose of pamelor (an anti-depressant found to be helpful for migraines) nightly_ which may have contradicted any depression symptoms_ though the dr. told me that the dose i was on was not sufficient to treat clinical depression. My main concern at this point is treating the gastroparesis now that it's finally been diagnosed. I think at this point_ my dose of plaquenil is as high as I can go w/o risking toxicity that may affect my eyes or something else_ so it might be time to try a new medication... but i prefer not to go on anything stronger as I've done so well with this one.

191, 2, Lyme Disease,Headache (all the time!)_ nausea/anorexia_ general stomach ickiness_ dizziness.,(Note: I started plaquenil simultaneously with zithromax; it may be that some side effects resulted from the latter.  I think it's mostly the plaquenil.)  Side effects began soon (within 24 hours) after I started taking it.  I stopped taking it over a week ago_ but the side effects still have not subsided.  Due to stomach problems_ I have to FORCE myself to eat_ I can only choke down a bit of fruit anytime before 4 or 5 pm_ when hunger simply wins out over stomach upset.  Meanwhile_ I have had a nonstop headache; it waxes and wanes_ but sometimes is almost migrane-like in severity.  I have continued working but not with my usual efficiency.  IMPORTANT QUESTION: How long did it take side effects to end?  I was surprised to find that this drug can take 1-2 months to be completely eliminated from the system -- does this mean that I could have side effects for that long?  :-(  I have stopped taking the zithromax_ in case side effects are related to that drug; the zithromax takes a week to clear_ so if I still have these problems in a week_ it's caused by the plaquenil.  I will update then.  I am reluctant to rate this medicine because I did not take it for long enough to see if it would have helped (and lyme disease isn't one to respond immediately to antimicrobials_ anyway).  I'm giving it a 2 for side effects.

I awoke on the 14th day to see hives covering my neck and chest_ I watched as they then spread within an hour to the rest of my body. Only my palms_ soles of my feet and most of my face were spared; it was terrifying as I'd never experienced anything like it before. I saw my GP who told me it was a reaction to Plaquenil but a VERY RARE one. I have been taking anti-histamines for 2 weeks and the hives are now almost gone.

Slowly over the last 5 years or so_ I think Plaq flattened my mood to such an extent that I looked forward to nothing - I had lost my exuberance totally. Also think it made my hair lose its colour - but that's hard to say as I am middle aged now!,I'd say it helped me greatly initially_ but then the effect reached a 'plateau' and I never got back to my pre-UCTD self. Guess that's expecting too much. I stopped taking it a couple of weeks ago_ because I was still aching daily anyway and I wanted to see what I'm like without it now - to see if my mood can be lifted. I feel I pretty much dragged myself through life during my 40s and I can't face doing that into my 50s too.

Have any of you tried the Antibiotic treatment for all rh. diseases? Although few doctors use it_ and med. schools don't really teach it_ research has revealed that these diseases aren't ""immune systems gone haywire_"" but they are the result of tiny Micro. bacteria which hide deep within cells. Even tho they can't always be seen on slides_ when treated with PARTICULAR low-dose antibiotics_ the diseases respond greatly; most go into remission_ and some patients declare themselves cured. (Doctors don't_ however_ because of the ability of the bacteria to hang on.)  Long-term treatment with THE antibiotic has not proven harmful_ when the patient is properly observed. And_ the doctor doesn't even have to be an RH one; any who will agree to use this protocal is fine. (Dermatologists already use this antibiotic in treating skin diseases.).....Go to link_ ""The Road Back_"" for more  info. With all the harmful drugs you are or will be on_ it makes no sense not to give this a try.

My dermatologist said that the hair loss is due to the weight loss (? hmmm...)_ and my crohn's is all but gone now.  My immunity has not been compromised because I haven't really gotten sick since I started...and I teach first grade!,Strange but effective.,F,36,5  months,9/5/2009,Plaquenil
240, 2, RA type symptoms,Severe depression,"It's possible this drug was helping me.  I experienced depression that was progressively getting worse_ to the point of feeling like I was crazy and out of control (in my mind anyway).  I've been off of it for several weeks_ however_ I still feel very ""off.""  This is the only medication I had been taking which is how I know my depression was caused by plaquenil.",F,38,3  weeks,8/30/2009Email,Plaquenil

243, 4, Lupus,diarrhea_ severe headaches_ itchy-like prickly feeling (similar_ but not as intense as the allergic reaction I had to a sulfa drug)_ increased photo-sensitivity_ and it seems like my muscles were MORE weak at times,The diarrhea went away after a couple weeks(thankfully). I initially took 400m daily_ but I now take 200m. I know there are serious risks_ but the renewed energy is something I've desired for a long time. I used to be terribly fatigued. Weighing the risks is important for those using this medicine. Having the energy to increase my quality of life is important to me_ so hopefully the benefits will continue to outweigh the risks. Good luck to everyone using this drug.....,F,36,4  months,8/17/2009,Plaquenil
244, 5, RA / Sjogrens,Nausea_ gas and bloating...but it completely went away when I stopped taking vitamins and minerals at the same time.  I now take vitamins with lunch instead of breakfast.,"I have been off and on Plaquenil for 15 years.  I am back on it after a 2 yr break_ but just discoverd now the vitamin/plaquenil link to nausea.  It has always helped with the ""flares"" and I am already near pain free with reduced swelling.  I feel it is the one drug that will keep me off anything more potent for a long time.

246, 3, Sjogren's,200mg twice a day caused low blood pressure_ poor circulation in extremities_ extreme heat radiating from my body that woke me up in the middle of the night_ frequent urination_ and heart palpitations.  Most side effects began at week 10 of the dose.  Stopped meds for 30 days_ most side effects halted quickly_ palpitations slowly decreased but never went entirely away.  Went back on at 200mg once a day_ palpitations increased in frequency during week two.  Not sure if I'll stay on it.,Overall the drug did reduce my aches & pains_ dry mouth_ and increased my energy.  I'll have to weight the pros and cons of staying on it.,F,32,12  weeks,7/28/2009,Plaquenil
247, 4, Sjogren's Syndrome,Initial explosive diarhea and flatulence which cleared after 2 weeks. Increase in yeast infections.  I have developed a rash and severe itching and burning in perineal area which may be linked to lichen planus?  I have decided to stop taking Plaquenil to see if there is an improvement or not.,Overall Plaquenil worked great for me.  My fatigue was GREATLY improved after only 2 months and the ache in my fingers disappeared.  After a year the extreme dryness in my eyes was much improved.  I am also taking salagen for dry mouth and eyes.  I don't feel good about stopping but I need to find out if the yeast infections and severe itching and burning are related to this drug.  If not I will go back on it.,F,57,2  years,7/26/2009,Plaquenil
248, 5, RA,Horrible nightmares at first_ gone after about 3 months.  Have had some skin rashes_ but not sure it's the Plaquenil_ and have some hair loss/scalp problems.  Again_ not sure if it's the drug.  Ditto on all the gastro problems everyone mentions:  gas_ bloating_ diarrhea from time to time. Some fatigue_ but it's much better than when I was in the middle of a flare.,Very satisfied with this drug so far_ but have been worried about my hair loss and scalp irritation.  I've been basically pain free since it started working (it took about 4 months to really notice).    I would be scared to go off of Plaquenil because I feel like I did before the RA.,F,56,3  years,7/20/2009Email,Plaquenil

Strange dreams but I have insomnia (pre-plaquenil)so the fact that I am sleeping is a good thing.,"This is my second time attempting to get on Plaquenil.The 1st time my mobility improved within the first week but I developed sores in my mouth and nose after being on it for two weeks. By the fourth week my sores were still active.  My Rheumy told me to come off of Plaquenil so that we could find out if the sores were part of a ""flare"" or response to the Plaquenil. The sores cleared. After three months being off of Plaquenil my sores returned when I was ""flaring"". Hence it was determined that the sores are part of my autoimmune disease not a side effect of Plaquenil. I agree. I am now back on Plaquenil. My muscle and bone stiffness has greatly improved. I've had one flare which was brought on by a fall (I sprained both ankles and my right leg). Even with that trauma- my flare only lasted three days. I have taken Plaquenil for one month taking one 200 mg per day. Now I am entering my second month. I have started taking one 200 mg twice per day. The side effects listed have come back and I am hoping that they subside over the next week like they have in the past month.",F,44,33  days,7/19/2009,Plaquenil

I also have Raynaud's which didn't change_ but improved greatly with Synthroid I take for Hoshimoto's Thyroiditis.  I am grateful this drug is working for me with minimal side effects.

No side effects for first 20 hours_ then nasty diarrhea_stomach nausea_ stomach cramps_ dizzy_gas_ burping_ feeling spacey_ black out when standing_ felt totally out of it - basically non functioning. Terrible brain fog.  Forget about driving_ going to work_ or doing anything other than praying for the drug to get out of your system.  Effects lasted for three days_ diminishing with each day.  Never took a 2nd pill. Also developed sore/scratchy throat which continues at day 3 but doc says not from Plaquenil.  Coincidence is too strong. Not on any other medication I can blame.,Could not tolerate 1 pill let alone taking it long term.   I think doctors should stop calling this a safe drug.  It has terrible side effects even for those on this site that give it a 5.  Exchanging one set of intolerable symptoms for another is a poor choice.

I wear cold wet towel on my arms and another small one to touch the other itchy areas. It helps but I can still feel the itching elsewhere. You can't live like this! I go to work and try not to show my scratching. This morning (2am) I woke up and took 2 benadryl_ zyrtec_ and slathered on benadryl and hydrocortisone creme.

I was getting worse everyday. I started with one pill in the morning and then accepted what I had and started taking the second pill. Within 3 weeks I noticed a huge difference.

I too_ tried to discontinue this drug and after 3 weeks I could not get out of bed.  My original symptoms were back and felt worse because I had lived without them for several years.,Please be very careful with the eye exams.  I had some brief episodes of blindness and more indepth testing was done (ERG) and this detected Plaquenil toxicity.  I am told it has progressed to 'irreversible' state.

However after taking plaquenil for nine years I am considering getting off_ due to the fact over the last couple years I have more tremors in my hands_ more hair thinning and now wondering if plaquenil can affect your bones negatively. I am experiencing more low back pain. Also interrupted sleep. More blurred vision than in the past and more muscle pain. I get the eye exam each year. My doctor tells me_ my low white blood cell count is due to the plaquenil. I will pray about what to do. I certainly do not want a flare.

Hair loss was pre-plaquenil and this has not subsided (yet). Thinking seems clearer. I have to say I absolutely love this drug.

Last few days tip of tongue and lips feel numb.,My GP contacted the Lupus unit_ as she said that it was the worst she'd seen me in ages_ and was told that how I'm feeling isn't down to plaquenil but lupus.

292, 3, unknown diagnosis,Stomach pains_ nausea ( mild to moderate most days) instestinal issues_ nightmares,Overall I believe this is helping. My morning aches and pains are not better_ my evening pains are much better.  My 'needle pains' through out my body have been much less severe and happening less often.  Today my doctor says to give it a few more months.  She sounded please with the results so far.,F,39,2  months,2/27/2009,Plaquenil
293, 5, MCTD (Lupus and RA),during the first 2-3 months_ I experienced red bumps all over back (fading_ but still there at 4 months)_ nausea_ diarrhea_ headaches_ bruising_ restlessness at night_ tiredness (probably from lack of good sleep).  Most symptoms subsided after first 2-3 months.,Could see the good effects from Plaquenil after about 3 months; My joints and energy-level feel better than they have in several years.  For me this is definitely worth going through the 2-3 months of side effects.  I still have some red bumps on back_ but they have faded a great deal.,F,23,4  months,2/25/2009,Plaquenil
294, 5, Lupus,Minor stomach upset the first few weeks_ some gas_ ringing in the ears_ some hair loss but have had major benefits on this med.,I've been on plaquenil for 20 years. I see an eye specialist 2x a year. Have never had a problem. I'm on 200mg once daily_ taken right after breakfast. My Lupus symptoms have pretty much disappeared while on this med. I still feel some fatigue. Before plaquenil_ I could barely function and could not work_ had major pain and fatigue. Tried going off my med once to see how I felt. After 3 weeks_ I went back on as I felt horrible. Will never try that again!,F,52,20  years,2/25/2009Email,Plaquenil

296, 1, Sjogren's,extreme dry eyes_ seeing flashing lights_ fatigue_ possible weight gain,I have been taking this about 1 month for peripheral neuropathy and Sjorgren's syndrome.  My dry eye problem has gotten much worse since then - constant burning and lots of goopiness.  I have incidents of seeing flashing lights about once a week.  I'm also feeling very fatigued.  I am a regular exerciser (5 days a week) but have had to cut back my work-outs for lack of energy.  That may explain the mild weight gain_ or it could be another side effect of the plaquenil.  I'm going to stop taking it today and see if things improve.  My doctors don't believe any of these problems are from the medication_ even though they all started about a week after beginning the medication.,F,50,30  days,2/25/2009,Plaquenil
297, 5, Lupus,After one week_ started having increased anxiety_ racing heart_ back pain and panic attacks about 2 hours after taking pill.,Doctors said Plaquenil doesn't cause those side effects so I stopped taking it and all side effects went away. (Was taking 400 mg per day) Started again a week later after all the lupus pain returned at 50mg per day. Cut the 200 mg pill into 4 pieces and take one piece in the morning with breakfast. Works great!  No side effects and the arthritis pain_ ulcers and rash of lupus are gone too.

I haven't the energy to go for a walk with my 4 year olds or the focus to help my 6 year old with his homework.  I'm afraid they won't remember their mommy as somebody fun_ but as someone who wasn't there. I constantly feel like there is drainage in my throat even though I'm not sick.  Have you heard from anyone else that feels this way?,I also had blurry vision and lots of goo in my eyes.  The swelling in my hands and feet is still there_ though not as bad.

My SLE went undiganosed for at least 5 years. The joint pain was so intense I was practically carried into the doctor's office. I was put on 200mg of this drug_ and some prednisone. The relief from joint pain was almost immediate. Two weeks into this treatment I developed a yeast infection_ that usually when treated_ would go away with just one treatment. I've had 3 treatments and the itching will not go away. I have been suffering from chronic itching on my upper back and chest. I have developed welts and rashes and I can't find relieve. The doctor gave me a shot of benadryl and more cortisone_ but no relieve. I've used all types of creams and homeopathic itch relieve creams_ but the itching would not go away. I'm strongly considering not taking this medication unless I have a flare up.

Rheumy said it would be highly rare for it to be from this drug and to start taking it again.  1 week before I started taking it_ my hair started falling out again.  Finally realized it was a side effect of my SLE_ not the drug.  The two times I have stopped Plaquenil_ I have been hurting so much I'm usually in tears and at the end of my rope when I go see my rheumy.  The starting back on the treatment_ life gets better again and I feel like I can manage life again.  I sleep better on this because my pain is so much better I CAN SLEEP!

Reduced appetite.Tiredness with some insomnia.200mg tabs > 2tabs once a day with or after food,Consultant prescribed this as I had regular episodes of RA with increasing longevity of attacks. Although blood works came within normal parameters the physical presentation showed the classic clinical signs of RA and after further examination it came to light I was hypermobile in all my joints and this can cause RA.After discussion ( hasn't prescribed for hypermobility cases) and the necessary eye tests_ we agreed to trial run for 6 mths but any possible improvement may not be apparent for 12mths. 2 wks into the program and joint swelling started to decrease less painful attack experienced. 2 mths later_ hands are almost back to normal with full range of non painful mobility. Slight ache experienced when with hindsight I realise attacks would have occurred. Have not been crippled with swelling nor pain at any point since starting this medication.

I have had Sjogren's for 9 years.  I rated it a 1_ but_ if it works for people_ who am I to recommend they should not take it_ however I believe this drug gets rated higher due to the skew of this rating system.  Philosophically_ I feel it is a 2. This medication made me worse_ and that puts me in the minority.  I was told it was not treatment_ but only to relieve symptoms. I was told it would not affect the course of autoimmune disease.  I do have severe esophageal dysmotility and this drug is not for any one with stomach issues.  I also have myopathy_ and this drug causes muscle weakness.  More problems I do not need!  With Sjogren's_ my eyes are at risk already.  I also have significant neuropathy which may be why the insomnia and neuro issues got worse. There are a lot of new biologicals out there now_ that are more  treatment based.

I had the onset of terrible menopausal symptoms_ especially anxiety followed by hot flashes many times a day. I don't know if the Hormone replacement therapy interacted with the Plaquenil_ but both drugs list depression/anxiety as possible side effects. The anxiety and weird dreams were worse than the pain of the RA ever was. So...I went off both the HRT and the Plaquenil...and feel much better mentally after 7 days. I was on the combination of HRT and Plaquenil for 9 months.,It did help the pain and seemed to prevent the worsening of the joint damage... I don't want to go on anything else as I seem to react badly to many drugs but only after I am on them for a while so it is hard to tell that the drug or drugs is the cause.,F,56,7  years,8/17/2008Email,Plaquenil

I have to say that I have been able to work_ deep tissue therapy_ since taking Plaquenil for the past 3 months.  I do at times feel achy_ but nothing compared to before.  I never want to be without this med. again.,F,42,3  months,8/16/2008,Plaquenil
346, 5, RA,Maybe diarrhea,In the very short time I have been on it_ I have improved about 95%.  I want to comment about itchiness:  I've noticed others attributing this to plaquenil. Well_ two months ago_ before I started on the plaquenil_ I had one night where both my underarms and the palms of both hands were unbelieveably itchy.  But there was no rash and the skin was unbroken_ and the next day the itch was gone.  Maybe it's not the plaquenil_ but_ for some people maybe it is.,M,74,3  weeks,8/7/2008,Plaquenil
347, 2, MCTD/Lupus,Rash on my sides and back that I could not tolerate - extremely itchy.,The doctors thought maybe I was allergic to Plaquenil. I stopped this medication and was started on Imuran. The rash or itch did not leave for quite a while after I stopped the taking Plaquenil. I then learned that medications to control Malaria (Plaquenil)can sometimes cause the development of Large Plaque Parapsoriasis. It took weeks for the rash and itch to go away. The Large Plaque Parapsoriasis has not come back.,F,66,90  days,8/2/2008Email,Plaquenil
348, 5, Subacute cutaneous lupus,No side effects_ infact my hot flashes diminished???,Have been taking it x 2 months_ my rash within 3 days started fading.

I now know I probably had the beginnings of lupus....wish we had hindsight!,F,59,2  months,7/16/2008,Plaquenil
349, 5, RA,occasional bouts of diarrhea and gas,It has really worked for me.  I took myself off the medicine once_ thinking I might not really have RA since it was totally in remission.  And then I had an unbelievable flare. I hurt so much I became depressed_ I could barely work. I have not done that again. I'm a believer.,M,64,6  years,6/23/2008,Plaquenil
350, 3, Idopathic Chronic Angioedema,Stomache pain_ cramps_ gas_ diarreha_ constipation(it would rotate for day to day).  But after the second week my tongue became sore_ and it progressively became worse.  I then went to the dentist's and she asked when I developed these funny red bumps in my mouth.  I called the doctor and he told me to stop the Plaquenil immediately.  I did and the bummps and sore tongue went away in around two days.,It was working.  I can put up with the upset stomache because I get worse upset stomaches from the angioedema than the medication.  It gave me back my energy_ stop the swelling in and around my lips_ and stop the twitch I get in my neck when I am very tried. But it seems I have a rare reation and so I had to stop.,F,37,14  days,6/22/2008,Plaquenil

It covered my whole body with the exception of the palms of my hands and the bottom of my feet.  Two weeks later after stopping the medication_ I am still suffering from this reaction.  Does anyone know how long this will last?,Didn't seem to help my RA while taking it.  The steroids (prednisone and methylprednisolone) for the rash helped more.  Will not attempt this drug again.,F,50,3  weeks,6/20/2008,Plaquenil

P.S. he also says the (irritable at times_ as well as nervous and anxious)should not be a typical side effect.

It helped me to function more like I use to before I had my first flare up and was diagnosed with SLE 8 months ago.  I really thought at one point I would have to stop working and go on disability or something_ the aches were too much.  My hair has stopped falling out_ but it does not grow as it use to.  Plaquenil has not yet help me with the butterfly rash I have on my face.  I can live with it.  It is still early with my usage of it.

It is a nasty tasting pill so take with juice or something to mask the taste.,I began taking Plaquenil in January 2007.  I was terrified of the possible side effects with vision so I have yearly eye exams.  I used to get constant fevers_ mouth sores and pleurisy.  Since beginning the Plaquenil_ all of this has stopped.  I only need 200mg a day because of my weight (130 pounds).  I was told the higher the dose_ the greater the risk of eye problems.  I am very thankful for this drug.,F,38,16  months,4/2/2008Email,Plaquenil

I am hoping I can go off some_ or most_ of the the other 11 meds I take at bedtime.  I am a pharmacist and need to be able to stand all day and not take meds that make me foggy.  I haven't been on very long but have noticed some improvement. I am still a good barometer as to when the weather will change_(achy_ exhausted_ depressed) hopefully after some time on the Plaquenil that will change.

Actually_ I'd have to say that it has improved my bowel function. It wasn't until the 30 day mark that this other GI stuff started. I did take several doses without food_ so I'm wondering if that could have caused it.  AT 10 days I started seeing big improvements in the morning stiffness that had been dogging me for months_ so in that respect I was pleasantly surprised because I wasn't expecting any help before 2-3months.   Dr. had said that patients continue to improve even more in the 6-12 month range and he didn't know why it takes so long.  I had resisted these other drugs because of the side effects_ but while the dr. was patient_ he kept suggesting it. It has definately made an improvement in my condition.

Back at work and am at about 85% and need to carefully watch what I eat and get the right amount of rest.  I was in intense pain for months before I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome.  Endep and Celebrex were prescribed and they have definitely helped as has a product called 5-htp which I purchase from an Internet company iherb.com.

408, 4, SLE,none that i can think of,i started taking plaquinel about  9 years ago.. it really helped control my lupus..i never really noticed any side effects in fact sometimes i forgot i even had lupus.. however last year my doctor took me off of it because i wanted to get pregnant and within 3 months of being off of it i went into a horrible flare up that i am still fighting after a year.  i am since back on the plaquinel (200mg twice a day) as well as steriods and imuran (which i never had to take before)  after all this i found out it is safe to take plaquinel while pregnant.  so now not only am i not pregnant i had to start imuran which you are not allowed to be pregnant on.  overall i have had a good experience with this medication.. and once you are on it i don't recommend going off of it!,F,29,9  years,7/19/2007Email,Plaquenil

It lasted about 10 mins and afterwards I felt really tired/and scared!! Please email if you have experienced anything like this. I have only been on it for 21 days at 400mg per day,I'm not sure if this is a side effect or not. I feel great in every other way. The plaquenil has helped with joint pain so much and I haven't had any probs like other people. My doctors are no help and are only interested in prescribing loads of medication - some of which I am not taking eg: prednisolone.,F,38,22  days,7/4/2007Email,Plaquenil
411, 3, RA,Only side effect - EXTREMELY itchy lips.  Also on Celebrex_ so I guess this could be causing it as well_ although the itchy lips started when I started taking Plaquenil.,So far the RA in my knee is much better.  I can really tell when I have accidentally skipped just one dose - the knee pain reminds me.  But I don't know how much longer I can stand the itchy lips!

413, 1, SLE,Started with the stomach troubles (almost like having the stomach flu for 3 weeks). Then the intense anxiety and depression kicked in_ which was not relieved by xanax or ativan. Major insomnia_ ringing in the ears and heart palpitations. The effects of my lupus were nowhere near as horrible as the side effects from this drug.,I'm not sure many dr's are aware of the awful side effects from this drug. All side effects should be reported to your rheum. I stopped this drug because I thought I was going to go crazy from the deep depression and anxiety.,F,41,2  months,6/28/2007,Plaquenil

418, 5, SLE,Some initial GI upset during the first 2-3 weeks.  The first week I had a lot of ringing in my ears about 1/2 hour after taking the plaq but 2 months into it that is no longer happening unless I take it when I am really fatigued.,"The Plaq has helped so much!  I was starting to feel like I would never be normal again. The pain in my hands_ shoulders_ neck and feet were making it really difficult to function and the fatigue was extreme! At that rate I expected that I would have to quit my job and try to get disability because I was absolutely at the end of my rope. After about 6 weeks on plaq my hands started to improve and I am doing much better. My ability to think and concentrate is much better which is a huge help to my confidence and my sense of well-being. I am still not ""normal"" but I feel like I function at about 80% of where I was before the lupus and I am hopeful that I will gain some more ground with the plaq over the next couple months.",F,30,2  months,5/26/2007,Plaquenil

I sometimes feel unstable when I walk. Pain is some what reduced but not gone.  I also still take 4 to 6 ibuprofen a day.  It does help to drink a few beers at night.,I have RA and this is my second time to take Plaquenil.  I was diagnosed with RA in 1990 many meds and 2 years later pain became manageable and I attribute it all to Plaquenil. I have been telling people about Plaguenil ever since.  I was down to 1/2 a plaguenil and had been in remission for a number of months and the doctor took me off in August 1996.  I became pregnant right away twice and taking MSM pretty much stayed pain free until June 2006 when my dad got sick.

Salagen worked heaps better and for the first time in years the saliva flow improved. But the other side effects had such a great impact that I halved the dose (from 400 mgs to 200 mgs per day). To no avail_ unfortunately. I ended up calling my reumatologist. She thought I was having a severe allergic reaction and told me to quit Plaq immediately. So I've only used it for 10 days.

Prednisone is what's making you fat_ what's giving you headaches_ bloating_ insomnia_ increased appetite_ constipation etc...plaquenil usually causes an upset stomach at first and then subsides--that's been my experience.I just wanted to help anyone who was confused about that part. But with the Plaquenil--it has given me 6 good days a week instead of maybe only one...I can get out of bed in the morning and walk to the bathroom without having to hold onto things---if you have arthritis and you've been on this medicine_ you know--it just magically dissolves the pain and swelling.

482, 5, Lyme Disease,"Brand name Plaquenil works like a charm -- no side effects. One time the local pharmacy filled it with a generic that made me itch after taking my shower. I didn't make the connection until I took the pill in the evening when I didn't shower and the itching was unbearable. It was my only medication that had changed. I called my doctor and asked him to write a ""Brand Name"" prescription. Several months before I had a reaction to a gabapentin generic and subsequently another generic when the local pharmacy suddenly switched from one that had been fine. After talking the situation over with my doctors_ we came to the conclusion: no more generics because the pharmacies switch day-to-day based on cost. If you have a tendency to be sensitive to fillers or artificial colors_ the only guarantee you have from refill-to-refill is to stick with the more expensive Brand Name.",Bottom line: before you give up on the potential gains many of us have seen in our lives from Plaquenil_ talk with your doctor about the benefits of using the brand name.

When the insurance demanded a diagnosis_ she diagnosed my Lupus.

579, 5, autoimmune (SS or Lupus?),I have been on the drug for about 6 months.  My skin seems to itch a little more but that could also be the thyroid condition.,To me_ it is a miracle drug.  Before Plaquenil_ it was a feat to just make it out of the bed.  My doc had tried flexiril which helped my restless  legs and I could actually stay asleep for most of the night.  She added cellebrex which was also a big help.  It took a little over 3 months for the plaquenil to really kick in.  And once it did_ I was able to begin living a pretty regular life again.  Before taking this drug I was missing at least a day of work every week - 2 weeks.  And on the days that I managed to get out of bed_ it took all I had to make it through the day whether working or not.  The fatique has been the worst part of my illness.  I am now reducing the amount of flexiril and cellebrex that I take.  I can now work 10-11 hours a day but I keep a pretty rigid bedtime.  I told my doc that I don't really care what name my illness ends up having - I just am so grateful for this drug and all it's benefits.  I still have flareups when I spend most of my weekend resting whereas before I spent most of my life resting.  It really is a wonder drug!,F,51,6  days,8/29/2003Email,Plaquenil
580, 4, RA,Major diarrhea until I figured out I needed to take it with a full meal_ not just a glass of milk. No stomache problems at all now aside from a little excess gas.,I've been taking it for 7 1/2 weeks and had all but given up hope that it would work. My symptoms seemed to have worsened rather than improving. Miraculously about two days ago I noticed a marked improvement_ especially in the mornings when I needed it the most. Feel better now - more energetic_ much less pain - than I have in almost a year. I pray that it keeps working. I'm also hopeful that I can get off the Prednisone (5 mg/day).,F,39,7  weeks,8/26/2003,Plaquenil
581, 2, rheumatoid arthritis,Dry eyes. Had trouble wearing contact lenses.,At first plaquenil worked although I was never really free of pain.  It did keep me on my feet.  After 2 years it took larger and larger doses to work and I had to take other meds to help out.  My medicine cabinet looked like a mini-pharmacy and I still felt bad.  Damage to bones also slowly continued. After 4 years it stopped working altogether.,F,56,4  years,8/26/2003Email,Plaquenil
