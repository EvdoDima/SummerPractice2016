0, 5, Gout,Trouble sleeping. Slight confusion.,Indomethacin is the labeled name but it was mfg'd by Teva. It worked well. After 3-4 hours the most intense pain subsides. After a few days you will be able to walk some and gradually feels normal within a few weeks. I would not take it any longer than required though.,M,31,2  weeks50 3X D,7/29/2010,Indo-lemmon
