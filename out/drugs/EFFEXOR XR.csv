0, 2, Major Depression_ General Anxiety,Drowsy throughout the day_ sleeping for a long time_ weird dreams_ heart palpitations_ minor muscle spasms_ lower libido_ skipped periods often_ heavy periods when I did get them_ migraines_ feeling slightly more aggressive_ lowered mental capacity.,It at least did something_ but the amount of side effects speaks for itself.It helped anxiety slightly_ but made my depression worse in my eyes. Despite the slight amount of energy I had_ I felt even less motivation to direct it towards anything productive. My inability to think correctly lead me to get frustrated when I tried to get work done_ and also lead me to being more rash with decision making. Sleeping more did not affect my sleep schedule. In other words; I was up for less hours at a time. Weird dreams is honestly the only good thing about this drug for me. The amount of side effects sure made life even less fun than it already was.Quitting this drug was horrible. Constantly felt like I was about to faint_ felt like my brain was being zapped with an electrical discharge. These were strong feelings_ even though I was gradually reducing the amount. I heard taking an SSRI while weaning off helped_ since withdrawal from SSRIs is not nearly as bad_ but I didn't have that since it was my decision to quit.This is surprisingly strong stuff. My brain chemistry still feels different_ and I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this. This was my second in line for antidepressants_ and if your doctor recommends this so soon_ reject it. Try something else before you risk taking this. Getting someone addicted to this so they have to keep buying it is dangerous. It does actually affect your behaviour though_ so it may be worth trying if everything else won't work.,F,17,7  months150mg 1X D,8/11/2016,Effexor xr
1, 3, Depression with anxiety,Headache_ light headed_ memory issues,Helped with depression some.  I stopped crying. Didn't help as much with anxiety.  The memory issues were disturbing!,F,46,2  months37.5,7/14/2016,Effexor xr
2, 1, depression/anxiety,Withdrawal from this drug is horrific. It's been compared to heroin withdrawal. Severe sweats_ chills_ nausea_ electrical shocks in the brain_ indigestion_ to name some. Oh. .. and my blood pressure shot through the roof for a few days. I'm on week four without and my brain is still trying to recalibrate itself. Not sure how long it's going to take to be better. Hopefully soon. The worst of the withdrawal is gone. My moods are up and down which is normal. Hopefully they'll stabilize soon as well. Good luck to everyone trying to get off this drug. Hang in there. It WILL get better.,This drug was a miracle for me. It did what it was suppose to. But trying to get off it is pure hell.,F,51,10  years150,7/14/2016Email,Effexor xr
3, 4, ADD_ depression_ anxiety,exessive sweating when sporting_ sleep interruption,My diagnosis was ADD with depression and anxiety_ my main complaint was feelings of chronic fatigue. Having tried many drugs (stimulants_ citalopram_ escitalopram_ Wellbutrin_ sertraline and even Parnate)_ psychiatrists wanted to give up medication therapy. After much insistence the psychiatrist finally agreed to prescribe venlafaxine. And with success_ finally an antidepressant that helped! Less tension_ less social anxiety_ less often sick and almost no suicidal thoughts. Especially in combination with sporting_ I feel much better. Side effects are excessive sweating when sporting and every night I wake up halfway. I now take 112.5 mg (75 + 37.5 mg)_ if I take a higher dose I feel very sleepy.I took venlafaxine twice previously and when I felt better for a while_ I quit. Reducing gradually went fine without any severe withdrawal. For tapering I used venlafaxine of the brand Bluefish (available here in Europe). The capsules do not consist of granules but of tablets with each 12.5 mg. Every week I took one tablet less and I didnt experienced any severe withdrawal. Only at the end a bit of the common electric shocks_ but I didnt find it very disruptive_ more like you had a glass of wine.,M,35,4  months112.5 1X D,6/20/2016Email,Effexor xr
4, 1, migraine prevention,This medication cut my migraine episodes down. However_ every afternoon I would suddenly become extremely fatigued and get a tension headache. I gained 10 pounds_ was always fidgeting and biting my fingers_ and made the most impulsive decisions.My thinking was very relaxed...easy and breezy. I actually quit a job with good compensation and benefits.I got married to an individual  that I would never of considered . I did not even want to get married previously. This medication put me in a fog. It took a month of withdrawl . I am now attempting to resolve all the issues and rebuild . DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. I PREFER TO SUFFER A MIGRAINE SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK . THE CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT WORTH IT!!,,F,47,3  months37.5 1X D,6/20/2016Email,Effexor xr
5, 5, Depression/Social phobia/Pain,None_ because I take my dose everyday at the same time in the morning and that I'm a responsible person.,Very useful for chronic pain and social phobia. Before Effexor XR_ I was avoiding social situations and I was so nervous in public. It also helps my depression and anxiety but if I increase my dose above 150 mg_ it has the opposite effect and I become wired and emotionless. It's more effective than SSRIs beside Prozac. I tried Zoloft_ Celexa_ Paxil_ Lexapro_ and I felt like a lethargic zombie.,M,37,3  years150 1X D,6/12/2016,Effexor xr

13, 1, Depression_ extreme anxiety,If I could go back_ I would have never taken this drug. At first it was okay because I didn't feel as anxious as I usually did. Eventually_ I began to have hand shakes and once in a while my body feels out of sync. I no have problems with anemia because I am always bleeding.Dr's have not suggested effexor as the culprit_ but it is the only medicine I take and it will not go away. I just keep bleeding and Noone knows why. After attempting to wean off of this medicine it feels like you are going to die. It does give you flu like symptoms and they last so long. The worst part is that I began to gain a lot of weight once I went without medicine for two weeks. I am the biggest I have ever been. I will give the weaning another try_ but with my job and kids I am scared to. I get so irritable and aggressive when I don't take it. I need to wait for the perfect timing.,,F,32,6  years150 mg,2/1/2016Email,Effexor xr
14, 4, Major Recurring Depression,If not taken early in the morning_ I can have sleep problems.    When I first began taking Effexor_ I had a racing heart but after a few months that subsided.I had been on several other anti-depressants before Effexor and they never helped at all. I really like this medication because it had minor side-effects and it actually worked_ for me.,,F,60,10  years150 1X D,1/19/2016Email,Effexor xr
15, 1, Depression,Dry mouth_ insomnia_ nausea_ tremor_ constant brainzaps_ sweating_ more suicidal than usually_ easily irritated_ changes in personality_ headache_ sleep paralysis and so much more,When my doctor prescribed Effexor to me_ he said that there weren't a lot of side effects. He was so wrong. It was the worst six months I have ever been through. I felt like I couldn't control my own body_ and the constant brainzaps almost drove me crazy. The worst part was if I missed a dose_ or took it later than usual_ I would throw up the whole next day_and the tremor in my hands made it hard to do basically anything. After a while on Effexor_ I started worry about the fact that I was way more suicidal than usual. My mom told me that she was terrified every morning to go into my room_ in fear of that I had hurt myself.Quitting Effexor was hell. Out of nowhere I would start crying like crazy_ hyperventilate_ and even pass out. It took almost 3 months to get off of it. I warn as many people as I can about this drug. After quitting I started taking Wellbutrin_ and it changed my life. Please don't poison yourself with Effexor.,F,19,6  months300 mg,1/19/2016Email,Effexor xr
16, 3, Depression_ GAD_ Panic Disorder,EXTREMELY dry mouth_ bad constipation_ irritability_ loss of sex drive _ withdrawal side effects.,This was the most effective med for depression that I've taken... it stopped my suicidal/self harming urges as long as I didn't have a reason to feel suicidal. However_ the constipation and dry mouth became too much and it wasn't helping my anxiety at all_ so I stopped it. I had the withdrawal side effects (brain zaps_ pins and needles_ dizziness_ stomach flu like symptoms_ irritability_ increased anxiety/depression) 5 days after I stopped taking it. They were/are pretty brutal_ but this is my first time not being on anti depressants for SIX YEARS_ so that might be part of the issue. That and buspar is making it worse.,F,20,4  months37.5 MG 1X D,12/27/2015,Effexor xr
17, 5, clinical depression/general anxiety,I have never had any negative side effects while taking Effexor. STOPPING it is kind of painful_ especially if you do it cold turkey instead of weaning off of it. You get weird electrical like zaps all over and feel kind of goofy.,This medication saved my life. I've had to stop taking it a couple of times due to insurance issues but I would never do it voluntarily. When I stop taking it_ not only do I have to go through the withdrawal_ which is not fun_ but my depression and anxiety increase 10-fold.,F,55,10  years225mg 1X D,12/23/2015Email,Effexor xr
18, 1, Depression,This drug is TOXIC. STAY WAY. I took it for depression and it worked well. HOWEVER. The withdrawals are horrendous.  Brain zaps like electric shocks_ severe aggression and irritability_  flu like symptoms_ and at times self harm as the aggression would turn inward.  This drug should be banned from the PBS. I am still suffering withdrawals after a month_ although the physical symptoms have almost gone_ I now feel depressed but I wonder if it's from the horrendous physical withdrawals.  I just hope it hasn't caused me permanent brain damage.,In my experience over 30 years of taking various anti-depressants SSRI's are toxic. Doctors are always praising their glory as they say there is less side effects. But this is not true unless your happy having insomnia every night and shoving more Valium into your system in order to go to sleep and this results in having to take more and more since lower doses no longer work.  If you want a crappy sex life hence contributing to additional problems in your relationships go ahead.  Never again!!  Yes the old tricyclics also have side effects such as dry mouth and slight weight gain but at least you sleep and your relationship is in tact. Never will I take SSR's again! 😡,F,56,12  months35mg 1X D,11/25/2015,Effexor xr
19, 5, Chronic migraine,In the beginning heightened anxiety_ stomach upset_ drowsiness,"This drug saved my life! For 9 months I had daily_ constant migraine activity (lightheadedness_ head pressure_ felt like the floor would drop sometimes_ visual disturbances). I was diagnosed with migraine by a neurologist and he prescribed this medication. I started ""low and slow"" because I was petrified from the reviews I read. After 2 or 3 weeks I started noticing improvement. God I'm so thankful for this drug!!! Been taking it for about 1.5 years. Pretty much brought me back to normal after about 6-7 months.",F,42,1.5  years75 1X D,11/21/2015Email,Effexor xr
20, 1, Depression,Please do not take this drug_ I started taking it for depression and after just 5 days my hair has fallen out at the front I now have a huge bald patch. It should be banned. One of the side effects is Alopecia. I have thick long dark hair and am devastated.,Horrible drug. I have since read a lot and found many people experiencing hair loss_ some now are having to wear hair pieces or wigs.,F,41,5  days,11/21/2015Email,Effexor xr

23, 1, Misdiagnosed as major Depression,DO NOT under ANY circumstances takes this medication!  The symptoms you have BEFORE taking this medication are WAY BETTER than the side effects of this poison.  I will focus more on discontinuance in additional comments.,Please read the information of many other patients who are desperately trying to get off this med_ myself included_ and imagine yourself trying to get off heroin_ crack_ meth amphetimines....

24, 3, Anxiety/ depression,Have only been taking it for three days now but the side effects have been pretty crazy. Not necessarily bad but feeling really stange. nausea_ complete loss of appetite_ loss of weight_ feeling depressed to feeling super energetic and sort of manic_ social anxiety_ trembling.,I'm on a fairly small dose and would like to keep it that way_ I think I will keep going for a few more weeks and hopefully it will help out with my other issues_ also I think it's better not to get too caught up in others reviews because they can mess with your ideas of the drug and cause some confusing placebo effects.,F,17,3  days37.5,9/20/2015,Effexor xr
25, 3, Depressive episode,Initially helped me to be able to deal with day-to-day tasks. Have been trying to get off for over a year now_ but to due to withdrawal side effects (feverish_ shaking_ nausea & feeling disoriented) I always revert back to taking it. Basically for the last year I've been on this medication purely because of the side effects of withdrawal & just couldn't afford time off to be sick. I wish i had been more informed about this medication before taking it.,Would like information and advice from patients who have successfully come off efexor xr and would like to know how long it took before withdrawal symptoms finally subsided?,F,26,3  years75mg,8/29/2015Email,Effexor xr
26, 3, Depressive Episode,hypomania_ agitation,This worked really well to get me out of a severe depressive episode quickly but overtime I started to feel a little bit manic_ agitated. I was making impulsive decisions and felt out of sorts so I decided to stop taking it (under medical supervision). The withdrawal for this was absolutely terrible and I needed several sedatives to get me through it_ shaking_ panic attacks_ brain zaps_ awful. Overall I have mixed feelings about this because after being off it for a few months my depression has come back.,F,26,4  months37.5 mg 1X D,8/15/2015,Effexor xr
27, 3, Major depression,Usual side effects of snri's + excessive sweating; hellish nightmares continously.,There should be some way to eliminate these side effects. This drug should have been tested and for these side effects eliminated before being given to patients.  I would definitely not recommend anyone taking it without being fully informed of ALL side effects. ,F,72,4  years75mg 1X D,7/27/2015,Effexor xr

29, 3, major depression disorder,I had difficulty sleeping at first_ but no other side effects. Medicine was the first ever to help me_ but trying to stop taking it is a whole other story.,Okay if I am even a few hours off from my normal dose I start having the strange electrical shock feelings in my brain. This past weekend had a horrendous toothache and went to a dentist on Saturday_ with my mouth hurting I forgot to take my medication driving home I could feel the zaps and stsrted to feel very strange. I was sweating but freezing_ I came home and laid down (let me mention I had no dental work done_ the dentist left early so my appt was cancelled) now I am a single mum of 4 children_ I was completely incapacitated. I would fall asleep and have the most vivid amazing dreams_ my daughter came in at one point_ which I do not recall_ and said I was screaming and flenching about. The next 24 hours were a pure nightmare_ tremors_ bouths of sweating that I saturated my clothes and freezing all at the same time_ like my hypothalamus was damaged. I have done my research boys and girls and this sounds completely harmful. They do not know if it withdrawal or serotonin syndrome which is deadly. This has happened to me before while on vacation I ran out of meds and I felt like I was a heroin addict withdrawing from heroin_ the difference was this did not stop it was relentless and the buzzing just gets louder and louder_ and the uncontrolled jerking of my hands and legs...it was bad.it wasnt until at some point on Sunday I realized oh my God I know what is wrong and I reached into my bedside table for the medicine_ within hours the bussing stopped_ by the next daybon my s,F,38,10  years150mg,5/19/2015Email,Effexor xr
30, 5, Depression/Anxiety,Brain zaps within a few hours if not taken on time. (short half-life)Occasional loss of sexual function.,By far the best antidepressant I have taken in after 15 years of being on different meds. Previously tried Prozac_ Zoloft_ Cymbalta and Lexapro. The best thing about Venlafaxine/Effexor XR is that it is a SNRI_ meaning that it works differently to most other antidepressants_ and helps with compulsions or obsessive thinking_ in addition to depression and anxiety. Small frustrations are now a breeze_ and major challenges are now more manageable_ whereas before I would find it difficult to complete even the smallest task without obsessing and fixating. Helps you look at the big picture of life and not just the small bothersome details. Downside of this is that occasionally it can lead to a loss of motivation because it removes the anxiety that often gets us started on something important. You have to take this med at the same time everyday_ or within a few hours you will feel withdrawal. This is due to its very short half-life_ meaning that it doesn't stay in your system very long. Other side effect I have noticed is reduced sexual function occasionally. Overall_ this med has totally changed my life. Sounds like a cliché_ but for me it's really true.,M,37,1  years150 1X D,5/6/2015,Effexor xr
31, 5, depression_ mood swings_ anxiety,At first I had a few side effects which have gone away completely. I remember I would have night sweats and trouble falling asleep. That didn't last too long and went away after about 2 months.,Effexor XR turned me from a total recluse scared of even being around people to a social butterfly. I had bad social anxiety and that pretty much all went away after starting Effexor. It help my severe mood swings and I was no longer crying randomly or going from happy to suicidal in ten minutes. I still had mild depression and motivation issues though and increasing the dose to the highest did nothing. I have to say Effexor XR has helped me out tremendously.,F,23,1.5  years150mg 1X D,4/24/2015,Effexor xr

34, 2, depression,Mania_ terrible withdrawal,Worked great at first_ then started feeling manic/anxious/irritable. Was talking really fast and interrupting people and not getting much sleep. Decided to get off of it and am still slowly withdrawing. It is hell_ brain zaps_ shaking_ extreme restlessness_ physical pain in hands and feet_ heart palpitations. I have been on many different antidepressants and never experienced such miserable withdrawal symptoms. Wish I had been warned.,F,25,3  months75 1X D,4/12/2015,Effexor xr
35, 4, depression/anxiety,Brain buzzing within 12 hours of missed dose. Less and less libido and sexual function over the years. Made my drinking into raging alcoholism.,Detoxed and AA'd up and stopped smoking. Too bad about sex_ alcohol and tobacco_ I enjoyed them all _but Effexor has really helped me.

36, 5, OCD_ Social Anxiety_ Asperger's,"Startup side effects (experienced during the first week and when escalating dose) : Nausea_ loss of appetite_ yawning (but not tired)_ getting songs stuck in your head_ feeling odd_ insomnia (it's a bit stimulating at first)_ night sweats_ vivid dreams_ dilated pupils_ ejaculation delay. Continued side effects: ejaculation delay_ slight daytime lethargy_ and emotional ""hardening"". Other than that_ you don't feel like you are on anything.",Effexor XR has been generally great. It's a medication I can't do without. I've gotten off it successfully twice (slow downward dose titration over a month or two) but my symptoms return. The only thing I don't really care for is the ejaculation delay. This is has been one of the primary reasons for me trying to get off of it. It's not all terrible however. When I reach orgasm it is very intense and it's VERY productive....The sexual dysfunction is dose-dependant and I'd be unwilling to go on a higher dose even though my partner is understanding. It has no effect on libido or erections for me_ it just takes longer to finish. It has been great otherwise. It's way better than the Lexapro/Cipralex I was on. I'm happy and can deal with stressors. My obsessive thoughts stop and are replaced with logical deductions. It has made me into the optimistic realist I knew myself to be. I have improved so much on this medication. I've gone back to school to study my passion and finally got the balls to come out as gay to my family and friends. The only issue is that I've started defining who I am while on the medication. It has therefore been hard to come off it for long periods of time because I start loosing my built-up ideal self. I hate being dependant on a substance but I may have to make an exception for Effexor. My anxiety and OCD rear their ugly heads when I'm off it. I need to make peace with my situation.,M,25,2  years150 mg 1X D,2/17/2015EmailHistory,Effexor xr

41, 1, anxiety,HORRIBLENESS!!!!!,So about 10 yrs ago was put on effexor and it worked great! Then had to up dose a couple times and eventually my dr added mirtazapine with it and i felt on top of the world! 2 yrs later got off all of it_ didnt feel need for it anymore. Have been off of it for 10 yrs. Have had bad anxiety for some time now tho so went back to dr and got put back on effexor and asked for mirtazapine(remeron) again but he said its actually an add on so instead prescribed me trazodone for sleep cuz ive always struggled with my sleep anyway_ Mirtazapine works very well for sleep also btw. Anyway took trazodone first nite and slept great but woke up really groggy! Took effexor that morning and symptoms became worse and got a headache. That night took trazodone again and didnt sleep as well but woke up feeling great! Then took effexor and started feeling horrible! Cloudy_ confused_ headache_ dilated pupils_ dizziness_ almost like a feeling of lost touch of reality_ just plain horrible. So looked up side effects and everything ive read is horrible about this drug_ made me remember when i missed dose yrs ago and i wanted to die but i never experienced what i experienced yesterday while TAKING the drug! Threw away my bottle a few minutes ago_ the side effects and withdrawal effects are enough for me to never touch this drug again! Im keeping trazodone and will continue to take it as it is also an antidepressant and for anxiety amongst a whole slew of other things.

I was doing all the right things_ eating well_ running 6-12 miles per day-training for my first marathon. I thought that was the answer. I could beat this thing without medication. That's what everyone says right? Diet and exercise! Maybe that's why this bout of depression completely blindsided me. and knocked me flat on my ass. I could hardly get out of bed_ the thought of brushing my teeth was exhausting. After months of feeling like I was swimming against a current to just LIVE my life I made the first step in what I have known to be an uphill battle. I sought out a depression and anxiety specialist. Sitting in that exam room that first day I remember just being a puddle of sad all over his floor. I thought he had extensive knowledge_ probably because he was one of the few Dr.'s in my life that haven't basically just told me to 'try harder' I thought he understood. Let me state that when I get depressed to the point that I cannot just 'handle' it anymore I know my own personal symptoms. It's a struggle to get out of bed_ I do mean a fucking battle_ its exhausting to have to do basic things like brush my teeth_ take a shower_ put on clothes.

I was on Prozac for about three years but after moving to northern Alberta from southern_ the winters became harsh on my depression. I had it increased but still no luck_ Prozac was just no longer cutting it. It was during my finals that I visited a walk in clinic in hopes to get another increase.

My mom being an RN was furious at this_ she couldn't believe that he would change my medication without knowing me or at least consulting with my psychiatrist (back home) I kept to my Prozac until  the end of my finals. I did research online and came across so many haunting reviews and even debated not taking it at all. The first day after taking it_ I had headaches and I'd wake up to vision issues this lasted about 14 days and they intensified when tweaking with the dosages. I am happy that I stuck to this medication_ within two month I began to feel what I imagine others describe as happiness_ something I had so rarely experienced.

90, 3, Depression & Social Anxiety,Initially: Erectile Dysfunction_ Decreased Cognitive Ability_ Memory Issues_ Sudden Weight Gain_ Horrific Withdrawal Symptoms (vertigo_ spinning room_ nausea_ light and movement sensitivity... lasted 2 weeks_ was bed ridden),This medication is an effective anti-depressant. You can expect to have a 2-3 month lead in with annoying side effects. Every dose increase will bring those side effects back. Once my body had adjusted_ all the side effects left me_ and my mood was balanced and lifted. My social anxiety did not improve_ but I believe I have a dopamine deficiency. Expect to be off work if you are coming off this medication. DO NOT miss a dose_ DO NOT discontinue without speaking to your doctor and reducing doses slowly. You will regret it if you don't.

93, 5, Depression_ GAD_ social anxiety,Increased sweating,I am a psychiatry resident_ and I just want to say that all ratings from people who have taken any SSRI (Prozac_ Paxil_ Zoloft_ Lexapro_ Celexa_ Luvox) or SNRI (Effexor_ Cymbalta_ Pristiq) for less than one month should be completely disregarded.  In fact_ this site should probably remove them.  These meds take at least 3-4 weeks to work like they are supposed to.  And yes_ people get GI side effects and headaches (since serotonin is mostly in the nervous and GI systems)_ but these are typically worst on days 3-7 from starting or with a dosage increase_ and they do get better.  Increased sweating has been my biggest problem with Effexor XR.  I have tried switching to Prozac twice (currently I'm on 40 mg of Prozac).  The sweating is better for the most part_ but I think Effexor was really helping to control my irritable bowel symptoms because it's kind of out of control at the moment (it makes sense due to Effexor's norepinephrine reuptake inhibition_ which is the mechanism of the older tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline that is often used for IBS and other chronic pain syndromes).  I've been on varying dosages of Effexor (150_ 225_ 300 mg).  I was doing really well on 150 mg for the past year but again I wanted to sweat less.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to go back on Effexor despite the sweating.  There are really no magic pills; generally patients need to weigh the benefits and the side effects (which generally improve or disappear).,M,27,2.5  years150 mg 1X D,4/25/2013,Effexor xr

I seem to be very sensative to side effects.  Effexor really seemed to help level me out and make me feel happy again and not worry so much.  But almost immediately_ my blood pressure went up and I became very constipated.  Then I started experiencing a racing heart and occasionally would feel 1-3 'hard' heart beats every 5-10 minutes.  After about 5 months_ I suddenly broke out in a rash and hives on my chest_ shoulders and neck.  My face would become red_ flushed and itchy and I'd itch from head to toe.

I ended up in ER twice because of Effexor withdrawal in the past.,It may work short term but doctors need to be more careful in the cost-benefit analysis of this medicine. Also_ in the event of misdiagnosis (as it was in my case)_ if you write this drug for a patient who is actually bi-polar_ you'll intensify the manias (when most of the suicides etc. occur).,M,31,3  years37.5 1X D,2/14/2013,Effexor xr

Most of these have improved but are still present.,"I started out at 75_ then bumped up to 150_ 225_ and now 300 mg.  I feel like 300 mg is a lot but I have had treatment-resistant depression and have been on SSRI's for a couple years so it's not bad.  With SSRI's_ withdrawals are not bad as long as you taper down.  If you are on a high dosage and you cease taking it immediately that's very dangerous.  Effexor is not ""addicting"" in the sense that a narcotic medication like Xanax is_ but it does cause chemical changes in the brain (that's how it works) and the readjustment period if you stop taking the medication is considered ""withdrawal"".  As somebody with a substance abuse history_ SSRI withdrawals are a joke compared to alcohol or any other narcotic.  You can't die from Effexor withdrawal lol.So far the medication has worked fairly well for me.  I am finally able to get back to work and I have motivation to do things again.  I have no major complaints other than the short half-life of Effexor (make sure you take this med at the same time every day_ because withdrawals can kick in just from missing or being late with a single dose).'I also take Trazodone 150 mg to help me sleep and Buspirone 15 mg to help with sexual side effects.Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns about your experience with the med.  99% of side effects (except sexual) get better within the first couple weeks.

I could not tolerate the every other day because of the ""brain zaps"" so I took 1/8 tab (18.75mg) daily for 2 weeks.  I then stopped taking any amount and the brain zaps increased and I was a crying_ sobbing mess!  I cried at everything and at nothing!

I suggest trying almost anything before this_ and if you do go on this drug be prepared for a living hell getting off of it. There have been a few that had minimal issues getting off of it but the majority including myself wen't through a special effexor version of hell. That possibility is my warning to anyone who wants to give it a try. Keep in mind the websites by the drug makers of effexor gloss this truth over. So look into it well before taking it because I sure didn't. Weaned myself off very slowly because I just wasn't getting enough good out of it and it was unpleasant if I was late taking my next dose or if I missed it for some reason. this is one med that you better not miss getting a perscription filled for.

I have had a lot of side effects with both of the medications_ but it has been a life savor for me. I have been committed 3 times in the last 2 years. I was also getting 1 on 1 counselling but at the time I didn't have any insurance and the laws changed. So I had to start doing group therapy_ and that didn't work. I always wanted to help others instead of helping myself. The Effexor XR worked wonderfully for me until about 2 1/2 years ago. I fell 4 1/2 years ago and broke my right ankle in 3 places and I ended up with RSD. Since then I have been in a power chair and I can do almost nothing by myself. I also ended up getting a blood clot in my right leg and was put in the hospital for that also. The Effexor XR worked so good for me with little or no side effects_ until I was raised up to 300 mg. I feel that a lot of the side effects that I have are from the RSD not the Effexor XR.. I am trying to get back into counselling now. The counselling does wonders for me. As far as the liver problems_ the Dr. told me I had a fatty liver. I am also on morphine for pain from the RSD. I would recommend for anyone to take the Effexor XR.

I'm just not as horny as I was before_ which isn't a bad thing.  Don't let bad reviews keep you from trying SSRIs or SNRIs each person reacts differently and it usually takes a couple med changes to find the right one for you.

I was put on it for anxiety. mood and while it seemed to help at first it eventually made me more irritable. the worst thing for me was the weight gain. the doctor said it was weight neutral...yet on my first followup visit her first question was whether i had gained weight..obviously she knew this was a possibility...i had gained like 10-15 lbs without changing anything in regards to my diet. i had always been slender and with a little diet and exercise could maintain a good figure...the weight slowly crept up to the point where i blew up out of nowhere...went from a size 4 dress to like an 8 or a 10 VERY fast! i got a trainer_ joined weight watchers_ cut calories and the weight would not come off...it was so embarrassing to have this unexplained weight gain to my family and finance -they saw how dedicated i was to exercise and diet yet i looked so fat and gross in my clothes...talk about depressed...this made me DEPRESSED...my doctor told me to ""stay active"" and ""eat lean protein"" really? duh?  finally i quit effexor almost cold turkey...i am getting married and cannot afford to be on this drug and have this disgusting weight gain...3 weeks off and already my body is showing signs of getting back to its old self..if body image is important to you-STAY AWAY! i wish someone had told me or i knew this or i never would have started this terrible god awful drug. fight through the withdrawals and take vitamins and y",F,32,7  months75 1X D,3/5/2012Email,Effexor xr

Doc put me on 75mg of Effexor XR.  Took that for 9 years and then I started having insomnia which was has been the major side effect of the depression that I experienced.  Bumped my dosage up to 150mg and I started sleeping better but I got major constipation_ more fatigue and just not functioning very well.  Its been very difficult to stay focused at work and I'm constantly falling asleep.  May be time to try a different drug.

I hope that's temporary because I can deal with everything else,I had been off Effexor for two weeks when my cat accidentally knocked my bottle down my drain and my insurance wouldn't override and give me two weeks' worth.

Side effects include significant weight gain_ gas_ severe sweating_ headache_ risk taking behaviours_ sleep disturbance and significant memory loss (i cant remember much while taking it_ like the 2 years were a patchily recalled dream) and upon discontinuation_ severe withdrawals_ physical and mental. Required meticulous tapering and psychological support to get off the drug. Am now drug free for 15 months and no longer suffer the original illness.

It's only been about 10 days_ and the night sweats are less severe and the headaches are gone_ but I'm not sure if that is due to cutting down or that menstruation ended about 5 days ago.,I've read online a long list of complaints of side effects from patients who are taking or who have taken Effexor. I am blessed that the only side effect I have is night sweats_ though it's so bad that I've changed my clothes up to 4 times during one night and I'm cutting my dosage without my doctor's permission.

After years of taking this_ I felt like a shell of my previous self_ doing things I would never do in my right mind. That and it was way too expensive after losing my job and not having a drug plan. So_ I tapered down the doses very gradually to minimize withdrawl effects... Wow. Worst part was the nausea and vomiting_ out of nowhere most times. Understand that this was what would happen when I would have a panic attack. I couldn't socialize during that time_ and I haven't even started with the brainzaps. They are hard to describe_ but its almost like a electric shock in your brain. Sometimes one_ sometimes 10 in a row. It was a horrible experience_ and I never recommend even starting this drug_ I would recommend Pristiq if anything. Having a relapse after being off Effexor_ and realizing the error of my young and foolish ways_ almost dying from an overdose of bad Ecstasy_ I am like this for life. I will always have seretonin problems_ and Pristiq helps control that_ with a mere fraction of the side effects. No nausea if you miss a dose_ you just feel like you need to stay in bed.

I now function completely normal_ and my dose was moved up to 150mg.  I seriously would be a different person if I didn't take this drug_ but the fact that I feel so bad when I don't take it does scare me.

One tends to think that if a drug is ""not addictive""_ then it would be easy to get off.  This is definitely not the case with Effexor XR_ so doctors should alert their patients to the this potential issue.

I would go to class_ come back and sleep_ and sleep_ and sleep.....All I did for six months was cry_ sleep_ get angry_ want to die_ want to hide. Horrible experience.

I have gone off of the drug twice in the 12 years I have used it. The withdrawal symptoms can be intense (mostly dizziness and brain zaps for me) but I found that if I tapered off very slowly they were tolerable.

This was after 4 years of being on it.I'm very_ very very happy with Effexor_ but I will echo two things that have been said here:  1) Eat it with food!  Nausea isn't fun.2) Do not skip your pills or quit this cold turkey.  If I miss a day I get edgy_ if I miss two days I turn into a monster.  Through all the side effects_ even having to take a small dose of blood pressure medication_ I happily take Effexor XR.

However_ I was still having physical manifestations of anxiety (racing heart_ etc.) and migraines so my docs kept increasing the dose.

For a week I couldn't walk and could barely talk or lift my hands to take care of my kids. I threw my guts up and sweated profusely.  It was a horrific experience and has scared me away from ever taking ANY anti-depressant again.

193, 3, hot flashes,The sexual side effect of no orgasm was the worst and is why I stopped taking it.  I had thought if this drug stopped my hot flashes and helped me sleep better_ that my libido would improve.  It didnt work out that way for me.   The first three days on it I had killer headaches but continued to take it and they never re-occurred.  I had to change to taking it in the morning instead of the evening or it would keep me awake all night.  It gave me several tremors (more like full on limb jerking) everyday.  Both the sexual side effects and the tremors occurred less often after a month of being off Effexor and  they stopped being a side effect over the next few weeks .    I didnt originally take this for depression but did get the benefit of it working for me in that respect.  I was calmer_ less easily agitated over the small things and just overall in a better frame of mind by the third week of taking it.  I was surprised at just how good I felt!

I have read that long term effects can be on your memory - anyone else experienced this?

I tried tapering off last year - got within 2 weeks of complete withdrawal and the first symptom that came back was crying jags and within a week I was into a full blown all out depression.

Nothing ever suits him and he blames everyone and thinks they pick on him.  He can't sleep well or at the right time or he over-sleeps.  He can't keep a job because he feels so ill.  He is now using more alcohol_ I think to try to feel better from the drug effects.  He does not figure it out that the drug has made him this way_ because he is so addicted to it.  Now his doctor says he is bi-polar.  I am sure it was the drug that made him bi-polar.  It has such terrible side-effects.  As a child and teenager up to age 20 he was never like this.

Nightmares every night and tired all day_ almost to a state of paranoia. Tried other drugs but the effexor xr seems to be doing the trick. It is a slow process and I take mirtzaphine at night. But I also keep all my therapy sessions. The drugs can not do it alone.

I went off the medication cold turkey_ and the withdrawal was brutal - I missed four days of school because I couldn't stand up for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling an intense dizziness_ almost as though my brain was sloshing around in my head. I suffered from paranoia in which I thought people were going to come through the window and shoot me. I was able to finally make it to school on a combination of Dramamine_ Motrin_ and Xanax. I would not wish the withdrawal on anyone.,F,17,1  months37.5 1X D,12/22/2010,Effexor xr

Was on Pristiq 50 mg for a while tried to get off and could not withdrawal without craving for the drug_ so asked to go on low dose effexor xr to satisfy my craving. This drug is addictive and has bad withdrawal. It can work for some people_ just don't believe that it is any safer than other addictive drugs_ remember all newer drugs are not addictive like cigarettes weren't a long time ago.

I was on for about 5 years and felt so good I titrated off it with help from Prozac.  I've been off Effexor (and all anti-depressants) for almost a year with no negative effects.

Short term memory wasn't very good while on it.,Effexor absolutely worked for me. I started to feel relief from my PPD in 1 week while on it. Then my anxiety went away_ been dealing with that all my life. I felt great! At times even euphoric. I still felt emotion_ I could laugh and cry when appropriate. No change in my libido(yay!). If it weren't for the side effects I would probably stay on it. The side effects are not cool. WEIGHT GAIN_ hungry ALL the time! SLEEPY_ but had a hard time getting to sleep at night. Short term memory loss_ felt ditzy at times. It was mostly the weight gain that made me quit taking it. I worked out 5-6 days a week but could not control my cravings and continued to gain weight. I tapered VERY slowly. I opened the pills and would slowly increase the amount of the little balls that I would take out. I had ZERO withdrawal symptoms. I would recommend Effexor to others and would consider going on it again if I were going through a rough time (although as briefly as possible).,F,33,1  years75mg 1X D,11/19/2010Email,Effexor xr

I have had Effexor a few years ago and remembered that I had a terrible time coming off it.  But this time around because I've had one of my worst meltdowns ever my doctor has prescribed it again even though I expressed concerns about the effects of the eventual withdrawal.  I have beern on it for four days so far this time around and I feel very strange_ like the world around me is unfamiliar and strange and frightening.  I got in the car to go to work this morning and ended up having a panick attack.  I drive around the block a few times and in the end came back home and called in sick.  I work in a high pressure where I need to constantly think outside the box and I'm worried that I'll start freaking out and failing.  I also cannot reach orgasm on this med.,I really hope I can overcome these feelings of strangeness and unfamiliarity of my suroundings and my fear of going back to work.

I gradually have worked up to 225 mg (37.5 mg for 6 days_ 75 mg for about a month_ 150 mg for a couple weeks_ and now 225 mg the last three weeks).  People complain a lot about withdrawal on this med_ but a lot of them don't taper like they should.  A lot of family practice docs don't have enough experience with antidepressants to know exactly how quickly to taper the dose.  At first this was a concern for me too_ but my psychiatrist assured me that by tapering correctly_ most people avoid major withdrawal symptoms.  I'm a second year medical student_ so I think I a reasonable amount of knowledge to know that he isn't just trying to make me feel better for the time being.  Anxiety ruled my life before Effexor_ and my latest episode of depression was the worst of many.  I was having almost constant GI problems_ which have been attributed to my mental health struggles.

I'll tell you what I am doing that seems to lessen the withdrawal effect. First get a notepad because you are going to want to write everything down because you will be decreasing your dosages. Your effexor XR capsule will have little white beads inside of it. Depending on your dosage_ that is how many beads are in it. My dose is 75 mg_ so I have 75 little white beads in it. Step 2 is to get a small dark colored bowl and a pencil. Next wiggle ""cap"" off the capsule. This is the shorter end of the capsule. Once you have it off then set it to the side. Now you will see that there are the tiny little white beads inside. Do not dump the entire content of beads into the dark colored bowl! (I use the dark colored bowl since it's easier to spot and count the beads). Now while holding the capsule_ tip it slightly to loosen the beads up and grab your pencil. With the pencil tip_ easily scrape the beads out one at a time if you can. Always check your bowl and COUNT the white beads because you need to be exact. EVERY DAY YOU WILL REDUCE YOUR DOSAGE BY 5 WHITE BEADS! DON'T REDUCE BY ANYMORE THAN THAT OR YOU WILL DEFINITELY EXPERIENCE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS! Once you remove 5 beads from the capsule_ screw the top ""cap"" on snug. You will have to wiggle it back on. Discard the beads preferably in an old medicine bottle with a child-proof cap. Take the capsule with at least a bottle of water to wa",F,31,10  years75 mg 1X D,10/26/2010Email,Effexor xr

Starting taking this as off-label treatment for hot flashes during menopause. Thought it was a God send- it worked so well. But then started needing more & more to keep the hot flashes at bay. Started feeling addicted & needing it when it was time for a dose. Lost ability to orgasm & started feeling just weird. Randomly took my BP several times at drugstores & it was sky high (my BP had alwyas been low)_ but couldn't get the same results at my doc's office- thought the BP machines were broken. Mainly due to the orgasm problem decided to withdraw slowly- had read the w/draw horror stories online. Felt w/draw symptoms but figured I'd hang in there & deal with it. That's when I had the heart attack.  No fam history of heart disease_don't have high chol/lipids_ not overweight_ casual smoker. Had a thrombus_ no hardening of the arteries_ etc. i believe the Effexor caused some kind of BP spike which created a spasm or vascular constriction or something resulting in a thrombus.

Two weeks later_ I began experiencing extreme headaches like never before. I knew that sweating was a side effect of Effexor_ so I attributed the headaches to dehydration_ caused by the sweating; drinking more and more water helped only minimally. Next came the extreme fatigue. Though I have experienced problems with energy that came with the depression_ this is something else. I find it difficult to get out of bed and necessary to nap for two or more hours during the day and all day on the weekends. I can still sleep through the night; in fact I think I could sleep all day and all night if I were allowed to. I am struggling to make it through an 8 hour work day because of this fatigue. I feel foggy in my mind_ apathetic_ am experiencing stiffness in my muscles and joints and recently have become very irritable. All in all_ I would say these things are worse than the depression I was experiencing before I ever went on medications two years ago. Between Lexapro (didn't help)_ Pristiq (miserable side effects_ depression returned) and Effexor - I can't seem to get it right.

Only problem is this med makes me slightly irritable to sounds_ sudden talking or disturbances ever so slight as they may be while I'm trying to work.  There's a little bit more lack of concentration on my part which can be mistaken for short attention span because this drug puts me in a state of La La land and it's hard to snap out of it bc it's such a nice place.,M,26,3  years75 and 32 1X D,9/6/2010,Effexor xr

Sweat heavily for no reason.,Even with all the side effects that I mentioned_ I thought the benefit outweighed the issues. Before taking this medication I would have at least one week during the month where I wouldn't want to go to work or couldn't do my job b/c I couldn't concentrate. I'm a web developer and it would feel like I'm looking at code for the very first time. Not a good thing when you have a schedule and you lose a week b/c you can't get your brain to work. Not only that_ but my emotions were hard to control. When I started the effexor I didn't experience the issue with concentration anymore and my moods were more level. With all this being said_ my husband and others that I trust were seeing behaviors that I couldn't see. I'm the type of person who wants to correct any annoying behaviors and it wasn't that I didn't want to see what they were seeing_ I couldn't. Well_ it got to the point where I am today. I saw a Psychiatrist b/c I felt that I needed to adjust my medicine levels to fix what was happening. She conducted her assessment and determined that I should come off of all medicines and fix a sleep disorder issue that I have and then I would be able to determine if medication was necessary.

I experience cold sweats most nights while I'm sleeping. I also am experiencing withdrawal after an accidental period of double dosage followed by halving the dose again to the prescribed amount.,I was previously crying everyday often multiple times for no reason_ after 2 days of the 37.5mg dosage this stopped and even when I tried I could not cry_ it was like the water turned off even if I was genuinely sad. As I was still sad but not crying I moved up to 75mg as I had still only left the house for work and university I eventually moved to 150mg which has dramatically improved my life which I am actually living again like a normal person. The last time I went to the chemist with a new prescription they told me to take 2 capsules a day of the 150mg which I did. I did not notice any changes but since returning to the chemist they informed me that was wrong and I am only supposed to be taking 1per day. It has been 2 days since halving my dosage and I am currently nauseous_ incredibly shaky and dizzy and had to call in sick to work.

The withdrawal is ridiculous. If I could go back and time and never take it I would in a heartbeat.,M,25,7  years150 1X D,8/10/2010,Effexor xr
271, 2, ,shaking_ withdrawal symptoms,I have used brand named for many years. If I missed a dose in the early morning_ withdrawal effects would not show up until late afternoon.  With generic_ withdrawal effects will show up by 10:30 in the morning.,M,43,7  years 1X D,8/1/2010,Effexor xr
272, 2, Depression,Have just been switched to generic after taking brand name for 5 years_ and have been very ill - feels like withdrawal_ which is nightmarish.,Generic has a problem - don't know if it doesn't release right_ or what (since Effexor XR is extended release) - it has made me very ill - anyone else with this problem_ please let your doctor and pharamacist know - please get the word out that there is a problem with this generic!,F,40,5  years75mg 1X D,7/30/2010,Effexor xr
273, 4, Anxiety,Side effects included increased sweating_ permanently dilated pupils_ nausea_ teeth grinding/jaw clenching_ increased heart rate (90 bpm) and increased blood pressure. The nausea and sweating subsided after the first month.,Despite the side effects this drug really did help me to gain some balance in my life_ I am now tapering off slowly with no real withdrawal syptoms. My main reason for coming off is that the drug tended to dull all of my emotions and I kind of want to feel things fully again.,F,25,1  years75mg 1X D,7/27/2010,Effexor xr
274, 5, for hot flashes!,none,I have only been on this for 2 wks but after one week my hot flashes stopped! This was wonderful since I just started having them 2 months ago and they were every 30 minutes! I feel happy and perfectly normal otherwise,F,50,14  days75 mg 1X D,7/23/2010,Effexor xr
275, 1, Migraines,Extremely tired...sleeping 15 hours a day sometimes. Migraines continued. Numb.,I needed to get off this medication to do a sleep study. I got VERY ill. Within 2 days of going off 37.5 mg I was vomitting and had nausea. It has been 15 days and I still feel awful. Migraines_ muscle aches_ tired_ gastrointeritis_ bloated_ dizzy_ shocks_ hard to concentrate_ brain doesn't track_ this has been a NIGHTMARE. My doctor did say that Paxil and Effexor do have many withdrawl effects...however_ they should be gone by now and aren't. I do not want to start taking this drug again. This is scary..I am not able to work and get things done.,F,49,7  years300 1X D,7/16/2010,Effexor xr
276, 5, Depression,For the first few months I had sexual side effects but they went away. Some weight gain,"The only drug that ever helped me. Others did not work or had bad effects. The ""brain jitters"" everyone talks about are very true when missing a dose. They are really no biggie_ to me anyway. Over all my mood is good_ I am much more productive generally. I tried the new generic version and it does not work the same. BEWARE. Even though it's cheaper_ the wreth brand works different and much better. I am waiting to talk to my doctor as to why but this is in the literature. There is a difference in this generic. If you are starting out I would defently suggest the name brand to see if it helps. Once stable_ then test out the generic for yourself.",M,34,1  years150 MG 1X D,7/11/2010,Effexor xr
277, 1, depression,"after missing 2 days of dosage (forgot to fill it): nausea_ dizziness_ MASSIVE headache_ ""brain surges""_ blurred vision_ inability to concentrate. I went through this twice. The second time I began researching the drug online and seeing how so many others were having issues with it. I know you are suppose to come off the drug slowly_ but by that time it was almost out of my system completely_ so I just dealt with the side effects and felt completely different after a week. That week was hell_ but to get off this drug was heaven.",Don't take! Stick with the older drug combinations such as Wellbutrin & Zoloft.,F,28,4  months 1X D,7/9/2010,Effexor xr
278, 1, Anxiety_ depression,"Strange itchy rash on my skin-scared for life now.. swelling of legs and ankles_ eventually entire body_ bloating_ constipation_ loss of ""caring"".. no sex drive_  insane sweating.. dizzyness_ heart palpatations.  These all occurred gradually as the dose was upp'd and when I complained to the dr's (three) they didnt know what to do and at first denied it was the effexor- eventually weaned me down- and all smptoms disappeared.",Cost hundreds of dollars to find out this medicine was CRAP!,F,36,1  years150 MG 1X D,7/3/2010,Effexor xr
279, 3, Depression/OCD,Nausea_ staring into space_ delayed orgasm_ increased anxiety at times,Good for OCD and anxiety but really didn't help with depression so my pdoc switched me back to paxil with no taper.  Even after taking for just 30 days the withdrawal was really significant.  I felt like I was a having a really bad allergic reaction_ but after resuming at 37.5 felt fine.,M,38,30  days75mg 1X D,7/2/2010,Effexor xr
280, 3, depression/fibromyalgia,Really helps with social anxiety and depression. Side effects are weight gain and horrible sweating. I really would not recommend starting though because when and if you want to go off of it_ it is so awful to try...I felt suicidal_ not typical at all for me...decided to stay on it to avoid withdrawal so PLEASE don't start.,,F,63,7  years75 1X D,6/29/2010,Effexor xr
281, 5, Anxiety/Panic,No side effects whatsoever,I have been on Effexor XR twice before.  Both times it significantly reduced my anxiety within a week.  Going off Effexor wasn't that bad as long as you go off slowly.Recently I restarted taking Effexor XR due to a return of anxiety.  It is working as it always has.  Prior to restarting Effexor XR I tried both Lexapro and Zoloft.  Both of those medications made me sick as a dog.  I am so happy that I respond so well to Effexor XR.  It makes me feel normal again.,M,47,4  years37.5 mg 2X D,6/19/2010,Effexor xr
282, 3, Depresion & GAD,more hyper /anxious -yet more energetic though..just tried cymbalta had alot of anxiety on that-now trying Effexor. Acne _ hyper_ insomnia_ diarrhea _ fogginess ,Anyone had any rash or increase acne? ???got this horrible ??acne rash behind my ear..looks like pimples but not? weird _ got it after starting meds,F,38,2  weeksat 75 now 1X D,6/14/2010Email,Effexor xr
283, 4, depression and anxiety,weight gain_ some jitters_ loss of libido,If you are taking this drug and it works for you_ stay on it.  I weaned off of it and plunged into a horrible state the likes of which I had never experienced.  The strange thing was_ when I went back on it it did not work as well.  I felt flat and couldn't laugh.  Now I am trying Cymbalta_ which I pray will work since this has been six months of Hell.,F,44,2.5  years150mg 1X D,6/11/2010,Effexor xr
284, 5, Anxiety,Weight gain; especially belly fat. About 10 lbs over 1 year without changing my diet or exercise habits.  I have been thin all my life - size 6. After reading other users internet blogs I realized that Effexor XR does cause weight gain in some persons.,For anxiety it worked really well with no other side effects other than than the weight gain.,F,40,1  years37.5 1X D,6/7/2010,Effexor xr
285, 3, depression,loss of appetite_ occasional sleeplessness and nausea. I went through the worst HELL ever when I went 4 days w/o taking the medication because i was having a problem getting Rx refilled. The side effects were HORRIBLE: dizziness_ extreme & endless nausea_ headaches_ major anxiety_ uncontrollable crying episode...it was bad. When I finally got the Rx refilled_ I felt like a druggie desperate for a quick fix--i NEEDED it just to take away the horrible side effects.,I want to get off the medication because I don't feel like it's working anymore but my doctor says I'm at the highest dose possible for this drug so I should just stick with it.,F,31,8  months300 mg 1X D,5/21/2010Email,Effexor xr
286, 4, Depression/Mild Anxiety,{35mg for the first 2 days} sleeplessness_ jaw clenching_ hyper activeness_ restlessness and finally 3 days later a collapse! (faint).-------------------------------------------------{10mg self-reduced dose for 2 months} often became easily muddled (dopey)_ an inability to keep to my diet hence slight weight gain_ decreased apathy and reduced hesitation to act on my thoughts.,Took half a 75mg pill for the first 2 days. It felt like i was on speed and then i suffered a collapse on the 3rd day. So Doc switched me to Celexa which i hated! Celexa felt like i was imploding and more depressed the longer i took it (for 2 and a half weeks).So i got an idea; to take Effexor again just in smaller doses_ since it made me so energetic. Long story short_ I've been reasonably happy with Effexor_ my apathy reduced noticeably. The only down side is that i often would get muddled (like ask stupid questions and forget things easily). Doctor found out i was taking the Effexor outside of its capsule so told me to switch to a new brand_ Pristiq_ which he says is similar just in tablet form.,F,29,2  monthsabout 10mg 1X D,5/19/2010Email,Effexor xr
287, 2, Depression,Agitated depression_ hypomanic-like symptoms_ mood instability. Of course_ these could have been unrelated to effexor. I also gained about 10 kilos (22 pounds)_ but it could have been due to other things such as implanon. When I started taking it the first time I experienced some insomnia and headaches. The worst thing about effexor is the withdrawal_ which the doctors don't seem to know much about but it seems to happen to everyone who tries to stop taking it_ and not just the people who post about it on the internet.,It just didn't do anything for me_ but no antidepressant has. I was on varing doses on and off for about 2 years and I was almost continuously depressed. Apparently it works great for some people_ and it doesn't have many side effects while taking it_ but it is VERY hard to stop taking it. I had to wean myself down to 5 granules once every few days before I could stop_ and even then I had brain zaps for a few weeks.,F,24,6  months150mg 1X D,5/9/2010Email,Effexor xr

290, 4, Depression,Insomnia_ loss of libido_ memory loss_ loss of consentration,This pill has helped me a lot. That is when I am taking it when I am supposed to. However_ the side effects are awful. I can't sleep at night and during the day I am extremely exhuasted. My memory is crap and I can't seem to consentrate very well. According the research I have done myself it has also caused both my babies to be born early due to toxemia. I wasn't taking it like I was supposed to with my second pregnancy and my child was not born as early as my first one.,F,22,5  years150 1X D,5/1/2010,Effexor xr
291, 5, anxiety_ mild depression,it took about 4 weeks to really start working. in that time i had strange feelings almost like i was on a high at times. pupils were hugely enlarged_ clenching my jaw alot_ suffering alot of dreaming i never use to. sleeping alot about 12hours a day_ coffee doesnt keep me awake anymore.have experinced headaches alot when i wake up mainly. increased appiette_ weight gain of course. no lose of sex drive.,effexor works very well. has aken away all my anxiety and depression. makes everyday life much more mangable. im happy with the result_ is certainly worth the side affects. the side effects are less common and some totally gone already. Very grateful for this drug!,F,20,3  months75mg 1X D,4/25/2010Email,Effexor xr
292, 4, Anxiety,Let me start by saying that I have previously tried Zoloft_ Lexapro and Paxil. The side effects experienced on these I found to be UNBAREABLE: Increased anxiety_ restlessness_ headaches_ inability to ejaculate_ suppressed emotions_ etc.Since starting Effexor_ the only side effects I've experienced is an initial increase in anxiety levels (which subsided in a week)_ vivid dreams (which I find to be pretty cool)_ and a slight delay in orgasm (which is NOTHING compared to SSRI's_ which required a marathon effort). The difference I noticed here is_ when I was on the SSRI's_ the sensation of sex kind of felt like nothing. Like I was getting no where. Whereas on Effexor_ it feels good like it should_ but just takes longer to ejaculate.,To date I feel a lot better. Not a 100% better_ but a lot better. I feel like I can get through the day with less worries which makes getting through the day easier (more happy and motivated). I feel less worried about social situations and I am not starting to look forward to meeting new people and socialising more. I really hope my comments will encourage people to try Effexor. I know drugs affect people differently_ but if Effexor can help me as much as it has_ then I recommend people to try it out :) good luck!,M,24,4  weeks75 MG 1X D,4/21/2010Email,Effexor xr
293, 5, Anxiety/panic attacks,Lots of energy (caffeine-like jitters) and always hungry.,This was an amazing drug. It made me feel much less anxious and I only had 1 panic attack the entire time I was on it - and it was at the beginning when it probably hadn't kicked in yet. The jitters were easily bearable (it just feels like you don't want to sit still_ but it's not unpleasant)_ though the hunger was no joke - it got expensive ;) I gained no weight though_ probably a combination of the constant movement and my already fast metabolism. The only problem I had was when I was being weaned off of it: that blood-rushing feeling in your head when you stretch or yawn... well... I got that all the time. It lasted about a week or 2_ and then it was fine. All antidepressants have withdrawals_ just make sure you wean off of it slowly. All in all_ a fantastic cure for anxiety and probably depression too. Just make sure you're being monitored_ because I've heard of other people not being able to take the side effects. I HIGHLY recommend it!(Oh_ I took it when I was 17 - I don't know if they've changed the formula by now or if my age made a difference. I know they don't prescribe it to minors anymore because of a risk of suicidal thoughts/actions.),F,26,1  years75 mg 1X D,4/19/2010Email,Effexor xr
294, 4, Severe Depression,weight loss; dialated pupils; racing heart; loss of appetite; increased energy; changes in taste; restless;,"Overall_ I feel better even after just 8 days taking it. I have not had any ""depressed"" lows yet. Dialated pupils and racing heart lasted 2 days. I've lost 5 pounds already. And about 6 days into treatment...everything sweet_ is now too sweet. I discovered this eating yoplait Cherry yogurt. It tasted like an entire box of artifical sweetner was poured into it. Same for tea_ soda_ and candies :( I havent tried chocolate yet.I drank alcohol while on this med_ and did not experience any side effects. Moderate drinking too: 2 margaritas and 2 full glasses of wine. Still feels like the meds are working",F,26,8  days75mg 1X D,4/19/2010,Effexor xr

He has psychotic episodes_anger issues_delusions. He no longer resembles the man he was 5 years ago_its like he doesnt even see me as human anymore.He is very abusive.He also takes adderral_which is yet another nightmare story,I cannot get medical professionals to take him off the garbage. He did wonderful on prozac,F,51,5  years150 1X D,4/17/2010,Effexor xr

298, 5, depression,Slight loss of appetite_ slight loss of sex drive but not as bad as other antidepressants_ very vivid and interesting dreams (I liked the crazy dreams).,Effexor XR is the only antidepressant that has helped me_ and I think I've tried them all. I have been on it twice for about a year each time...I felt wonderful while on it but it gradually stops working after about a year. Felt so much better while on this drug...I was friendly_ outgoing_ could laugh about things_ felt normal. My emotions were great...felt fairly happy most of the time but not zombie-like. There were still times when I felt down but they didn't develop into depression like they would have had I not been on the drug. I actually lost about 5-10 lbs while on this drug. It helped my anxiety so I stopped munching out of boredom/stress. Really changed my life for the time I was on it. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work for long periods of time. It is hard to wean off of_ but I think the benefits far outweighed the inconvenience of withdrawal. Wean  yourself off slowly. I only took 75 mg so I switched to 37.5 for a month or so_ then started taking the 37.5 every other day_ then every third day. You will have headaches and flu-like symptoms and weird electrical jolts in your brain for a few days during the process. It's not such a huge deal.,F,32,2  years75 mg 1X D,4/5/2010,Effexor xr
299, 1, Anxiety/ Depression,Decreased sex drive_ weight gain_ withdrawals less than an hour after missing a dose_ stopped working.,I was on Effexor for 3 years. The first 2 years it worked wonders_ I felt great. Then it started to wear off and stopped giving me any benefit whatsoever. I spent a YEAR getting off that medication. I had severe withdrawals for 6 months (some of the side effects of withdrawal like motion sickness still have not gone away more than two years later)_ and the stress of the withdrawals triggered severe GERD which I was hospitalized for. I would never recommend this medication to anyone unless they plan on never getting off it ever.,F,21,3  years300 MG 1X D,4/3/2010,Effexor xr
300, 3, Postpartum Depression/ Anxiety,Weight gain-90 lbs! Decreased sex drive_ difficult to reach orgasm. Night sweats.,This drug helped me so much. However_ now I am trying to get off. Before this I took Paxil_ again with the weght gain. Celexa made me vomit immediately. SSRS effect people in different ways. I was hospitalized under suicide watch when my baby was 2 months old. Effexor did help me through it. I did feel good_ after the dry mouth_ nausea etc. stopped_ it worked great. But now the excessive weight gain has me depressed! I have no interest in sex. It has been 14 days since I took a pill_ and sometimes it is literally minute by minute to get through. My mood swings are terrible! I feel overwhelmed_ like before. The headaches are horrible! It is so tempting to go back on_ but I want to be slim again. I used to be so small. My pharmacist addmitted that weight gain is a side effect_ while my Dr denied it. My dietition told me my diet is fine_ it's probably the effexor. 7 years is a long time to be dependent on a drug. I hope I can do this. From what I have been reading here_ I am not alone.,F,36,7  years75 1X D,3/30/2010,Effexor xr
301, 1, depressions\,I you miss even just one dose of this medication.....I experienced terrible nausea_ diarrhea_ dizziness_ fatigue_ horrific headaches and 'brain zaps'.,DO NOT EVER start on this drug.  If you are already on it_ talk to your doctor about weaning the dose. Wean very slowly as these side effecs can_ at times_ be crippling.,F,34,2  years150mg 1X D,3/30/2010,Effexor xr
302, 4, Depression,Vivid dreams_ shallow moods (like I literally could not feel true sadness_ guilt_ anger).  Every day had a little bit more sunshine.,Effexor worked great for my depression.  My only complaint was that I could no longer write deep poetry because I was so happy all the time.  The vivid dreams I had were absolutely incredible.  The only problems I had were when I forgot to take it.  If I missed a pill_ I would get panic attacks_ be short of breath_ couldn't focus or function at all_ and have cold sweats.  This would all go away upon taking the next pill.  I went off Effexor because I didn't want to get hooked and take it for the rest of my life (my dad has taken it for years.)  I went off of it on my own_ without a psychiatrist_ by dividing the capsules and weening myself off.  (Note: I did go through a severe panic attack when I tried going cold turkey-- dumb idea to begin with.)  It was a great drug when I needed it_ just be careful.,F,19,2  years150 mg 1X D,3/24/2010,Effexor xr
303, 4, Depression_ Anxiety,Vivid dreams_ lack of any sex drive_ constipation_ farting_ some sleepiness.,If I take a weekend off_ I can have sex/orgasms.  When I have gone off the medication_ the depression and anxiety is so awful.  I will deal with the side effects any day for how Effexor has changed my life for the better.,F,39,9  years75 mg 1X D,3/17/2010Email,Effexor xr
304, 4, Depression,I gained 15 pounds on this which was OK for me as I've always been slim and it was better to be a little plump and happier.  However recently it seems to have stopped working for me so I will probably try something new.,I found effexor xr combined with celexa to be a good cocktail of meds for my depression.  No sexual side effects which was very nice after prozac and paxil completely took all libido away.,F,48,6  years75mg 1X D,3/17/2010,Effexor xr
305, 1, Severe anxiety,Sweating_ insomnia_ nausea_ space feeling_ feeling very depressive_ horrible boost of anxiety_ feeling going crazy_ hyperactivity.,It's the worst thing_ no doubt about this. Pure poison. I thought I would really disconnect from reality. I got dreams (the few hours I was able to sleep) that were like over the reality. It's like to be trapped in a dream and you can't do anything to escape. The only thing similar to this_ was when I got a high fever during a night. I don't care if this drug can help some people. So many are saying that it's poison_ and they are right. People with good experiences are surely a minority. This was the most scary experience of all my life. I ended at ER begging for a way to stop this crazyness. Before to try it I thought it should be used at last resort. I got confident and tried it anyway. But I was right...it was a bad idea. Before I tried paxil_ zoloft_ wellbutrin_ celexa_ seroquel_ zyprexa_ and no one was near the hell of effexor. I got night panics on celexa and it was nothing compared to effexor. Whatever your doctor is good or not_ stay away from effexor except if you tried everything.,M,28,2  days37.5 1X D,3/16/2010Email,Effexor xr
306, 3, Depression and Anxiety,Excessive sleepiness (10 hour or more of sleep)_ when awake I felt like I was on speed: heart racing_ jittery. Not much of an appetite at all_ kind of force myself to eat something each day. Sex drive is low as well.,"I've been on this drug in the past (5 years ago) and it worked wonders then_ almost to the point of feeling manic_ though.  I stopped taking it then b/c it raised my blood pressure to much.  I am now trying it again hoping the side effects that I experienced then (and now) will taper off. I do recommend being cautious and educated on this drug before taking it and always wean off of it gradually.  Luckily my side effects are no where near as bad as other peoples_ but its the withdrawal I am worried about even if the manufacturer says there are no ""withdrawal symptoms.""  I personally call bullshit.",F,30,8  days75mg 1X D,3/15/2010Email,Effexor xr
307, 4, depression/anxiety,weight gain in the past,I am back on Effexor after a month of trying Pristiq.  For some reason_ the Effexor works better for me.   I don't think it has fully kicked in yet_ but I feel better.  It is true that this stuff helps you take things more lightly.  I might try a combo of it with Wellbutrin_ for the sake of motivation,F,44,7  days75-150mg 1X D,3/14/2010,Effexor xr

310, 4, panic attacks/anxiety,terrible headaches and nausea when missing a dose. otherwise_ no more panic attacks and reduced anxiety. mild insomnia rarely.,i had my first panic attack at 11 years old_ two years after my father passed away. i was first prescribed paxil_ and had an allergic reaction_ then i was put on welbutron_ and it did nothing for me. i was then put on Effexor 37.5mg once a day and it worked wonders for me. When i turned 13_ was uped to 75 mg once a day. I did not have a single panic attack_ and rarely felt anxious for two more years (4 years anxiety free). although when missing a dose i had terrible headaches_ almost migraines_ and got very sick to my stomach_ when i took it right i had no problems. the older i got the less i took it. No specific reason_ just a forgetful teenager i guess_ but in about three months or so i had gotten myself off of it on my own and was still anxiety free without it. during finals week of my junior year (i was 17) i had a week long panic attack. Full blown panic attack_ shaking_ numbness_ constantly crying_ fainting. although it came in waves it never fully went away. i went back to the doctor and was prescribed it again at 37.5mg once a day. i dont know if my body had changed or what but every time i took it_ although a little less anxious_ i had terrible headaches and was very sick to my stomach. it was like i had the withdrawal effects only when i took it as prescribed. i didnt even finish the first bottle.,F,19,2  years37.5 1X D,3/9/2010,Effexor xr
311, 3, Depression,- Weight gain. (No matter how much I worked out_ I was never able to get ripped. Like all SSRI's_ Effexor causes water retention).- Chronic Fatigue (Tired all the time.  Even after sleeping 10 hrs.  As soon as I got off Effexor_ the fatigue is gone).- Sweating (You will sweat and feel hot all the time. Again_ as soon as I stopped taking the effexor the sweating disappears).,Effexor was a Godsend in my life when I needed it most.  It lifted me from hell and brought me back my old happy self.  A couple of things about this medicine:DO NOT DRINK when you use Effexor.  It will lower the effectiveness of the medicine PERMANENTLY and you will be left wondering why the meds are no longer working as good as they used to.- Getting off Effexor is some of the worst hell imaginable.

I often wonder whether these medications ""pooping out"" for about 30% of people is a clue to the underlying biological cause of depression.

This is especially true for anyone diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or other GI issues. These pills wreck havoc on your digestive system. I was up to 150 mg for about 4 months_ then went down to 75 mg because the vast list of side effects was negating any benefits I had gained. For a couple weeks while on the 150 mg_ I felt more mentally balanced_ but also felt like Id need to keep upping the dose_ which I didnt want to do. Ive been sober for 14 years and have an addictive nature so upping the dose to infinity is not a good idea. My doctor wanted me to go off slowly_ but since being on these pills has destroyed my relationship (not to mention my sanity)_ I was on 75 mg for two weeks then just went off. Ive been off for 6 days now and I cant believe this drug is legal. The dizziness and nausea seems like itll never stop. Am trying supplements and motion sickness pills_ but they dont seem to be helping. Im just trying to ride it out.

Initially (after 4-6 wks) the medicine helped level out my violent (literally) mood swings as well as decrease suicidal thoughts. However_ my doctor & I kept increasing the dosage (150 mg became the cap_ & I'm about 100 lbs) until I essentially became so sedated that virtually all I did for the past 2 yrs was sleep. I became apathetic & completely lost my sex drive_ which eventually ended my 5 yr relationship (we didn't have sex for 2.5 years). Getting off the medicine was very hard - I had too much withdrawal sickness on just lowering the dosage_ so had to break open the capsules & count out the beads for about 3 months (the only way it was possible to get off). I had a dramatic increase in energy almost immediately after getting off Effexor_ but after being drug-free for about 3 months & feeling just as bad as I did before I started the medicine_ am now trying Wellbutrin instead. I did not have any counseling while on Effexor_ but I would recommend it with any medication like this_ as I feel like all I did was live in a drug-induced denial for the past 4 yrs.

I was taken off Depakote and put back on Effexor 6 months ago. What a great decision! I have more energy_ don't feel sluggish_ and my weight was great until I was put on Seroquel to help with sleeping. Seroquel will make you gain weight! Just went off that. I did have to decrease my Effexor from 150mg/day to 75 mg/day because it did seem to increase my anxiety and really affect my ability to fall asleep. I like the lower dose much better.

Agree that there are many side effects with all anti-depressants. Effexor XR was prescribed to me as a soothing_ no side-effects anti-d.  Well that's bullshit. Three months ago I was on 275 mg. I went down to 175 mg for three weeks_ 150mg for two weeks_ and have slowly dosed down to 75mg for another two weeks_ dividing capsules in half for another two weeks_ taking out beads per advice on this website. Thank you!  Throughout this dosing down there have been the proverbial EFFEXOR BRAIN ZAPS.  I liken the zaps to people with low blood pressure_ like my husband. When he stands up too quickly_ he feels giddy -- light-headed -- for a few seconds.  But it's not fun when it's happening to you all day.  I did two days over the holiday season with zero Effexor_ but absolutely needed my half capsule of beads on day three.  Medication of this nature may work for some_ but my gut feeling tells me that this is an extremely addictive drug_ needs to be treated with caution by those prescribing and those using.  The jury is not yet out.  It has certainly not worked for me.  I am offically off it and feeling so much more me.  I completely understand why many of you who have written on this website feel that Effexor XR is addictive.

I once again had to be put on Xanax to get through.,When I stopped taking Effexor after being on it for about 3 years_ my doctor first reduced my dosage to 75 mg (I had been on 150) then down to 37.5. I had no problems when I was taking it. It was when I stopped taking the 37.5 that I started experiencing what are now referred to as brain shivers. Every few seconds_ I felt like I was getting an electrical zap in my brain. It was unpredictable and awful. It lasted over a month_ probably about 6 weeks.

Effexor xr has truly been the best medication i have found to work for anxiety. i use to break out in sweats becasue i was so nervous. effexor helps me stay positive and gives me a better outlook on life. i actually feel like a normal person for once. i hate taking meds but i think of anxiety like a broken arm you got to wear a cast tell it gets better. i take 75mg every morning at the same time. be sure to take this med at the same time. i also drink a full glass of water with my dose. some meds arent for everyone. you got to just keep trying till you find one that meets your chemistry. this web site is good but id advise you to not go on it when your trialing a new med because everyones different.

While the med did help get me through the most severe portion of my depression I was in physical pain if I missed a single dose. My head felt so odd. I can't put it into words. Add in nausea and irritability. I feel I was kept on this med much too long. I do need 'long term management' but this is a hard core SSRI. I just started taking Celexa and feel much better - awake!,THE WITHDRAWAL - I now have a new understanding for drug addicts / alchoholics. Damn! I was 'forced' into withdrwal. I had tapered down to 75mg/day (from 225) and was out of town w/o my Effexor. Long story short it was a hell of a week1 I was tapering because I eventually wanted to get off but not like that. TAPER SLOWLY PEOPLE!!! If I new somebody around me had Effexor I would have sold my body to 'get my fix'. Nausea_ vomitting_ irritability_ tearfullness_ the funny head feeling_ on and on. What a rollercoaster ride! Glad to be off! Again_ I did need it during the mosr severe part of my depression but there are so many other options that do not have such withdrawl symptoms.

I love the suggestion where a person opened their capsuals & removed a certain number of ""beads"" every day.  I basically did the same thing on a day where I had a big commitment to my kids and knew I couldn't miss it.  I opened the capsual and removed most of the medication.  Put it back together & had relief from my symptoms in a few hours!!!  If this drug is still going to be prescribed_ a more appropriate taper method needs to be developed!

I should have been taking meds when I was younger too but back then we did not know all that we know today. I had taken Zoloft before and tried to switch from it to Wellbrutin XL with no luck. Zoloft side effects for me were tiredness_ less energy and low sex drive. I had to slowly get off Zoloft by doing without it every other day and then completely got off_ then started taking Wellbrutin.  It was awful.  I cried alot_ was panicking and was miserable.  I had to start my Zoloft again. My husband saw me crying while sitting at my makeup mirror one Sunday morning and said ""Get back on your Zoloft_ doing without the few side effects are not worth it!"" The doctor said it was because they are different types of drugs.  So...I stayed on Zoloft for a few more years but was always tired.

A lot of nausea and returning anxiety.,I have used other ADs before_ but EFX was the best one so far. I got it when i had severe panic attacks and anxiety. It also worked for my ADD. For the first time in my life i didnt worry a lot about the little things. I could be myself around other people. I felt confident. I went to the gym almost every day and i started to cook everyday. I started with 75mg and after that switched to 150mg and then 225mg. The 150mg made me feel the best but also made me tired and less motivated. After 2 years i decided to quit because of worsening of the tiredness_ which was so bad at times i could hardly function. It took me 1_5 years to go from 150mg to 0mg. The first 2 drops from 150mg to 112mg and 112mg to 75mg where ok. But below 75 it was utter hell. I didnt make it to 37_5mg so when i went back to 75mg i was ok again_ but i noticed the efx didnt work the same anymore. After 6 months i was so tired i couldnt get out of bed so i decided to quit the EFX in hospital. This time it went remarkably well and within 2 weeks i went from 75mg to 0mg. After that i had for about 3 weeks little bit of brain zaps and a little bit of nauseau and i was also a zombie at times. Now 9 weeks later i still have a lot of mood swings which for part is of quitting the EFX but probably also my ADD. Also getting my feelings back which i lost for the most part.

When I first started taking it_ I thought I was seeing some improvement_ but I feel more unmotivated and depressed than I ever have today. After missing a dose (haven't missed a dose in awhile) I had the most vivid and unintelligible dream tonight that caused disorientation and confusion (I did not know where I was for a few min.) upon waking. Withdrawal symptoms will alter thinking and change behavior_ and I've never gone more than 24-hours without a dose. I'm going to be tapering this drug off.

I didn't realize just how much it did help! For several months after weaning I started having horrible sweating spells. My mind wasn't sharp and things didn't look as clear as they once did. I could be standing somewhere and I'd start sweating with beads of sweat pouring off my temples_ forehead_ and down my back. I felt anxious and had no desire to go out and about. I began thinkng there must be something horribly wrong with me or I had thyroid issues going on because no one around me was sweating. After my blood work came back normal_ I sat down with my doctor and talked more about the sweating.

I got on Zoloft and in time was up to 150mg.  I felt better_ but the weight gain was killing me.  OK_ now I dont feel better_ at least I think I do_ but the way my body looks_ makes me want to jump off a bridge and kill myself.  Now I am right back where I started from.  After time_ I was tired of the weight gain and didnt feel like the Zoloft was working for me anymore.  I went to the Dr. and he switched me to Effexor XR.  In no time_ I was up to 150mg.  Today_ I have not lost any weight_ just gained.  AND to tell you the truth_ I guess I really dont feel any better_ cause I am depressed about the way I look.  I weigh more now_ than when I was 9 mon. pregnant.  I cry for everything.  My family and I feel like now is my time to get off ALL anti- depressants.

It was terrible getting off the drug.,Don't do it. There are other antidepressants out there that are easier to come off of when the time is right. This one is just ridiculous. I take xanax now on a daily basis for anxiety and have been off all anti-depressants for 2 months now. I feel better_ but am working on that 20lb weight gain.

What does that say about this horrible drug?   He would have been 31 years old_ he left a 2 year old son_ and wife behind and his brother_ sister and me and his father_ and all the people who loved him_ because he was truly a very good man_ everyone loved him_ so what does that say about this drug_ or any of these drugs_ I could not believe he did that_ he was a survivor_ but he gave up_ I believe this medicine killed my son_ mentally!!!!where is the site for the lawsuit_ someone please tell me?,F,54, ,6/30/2009Email,Effexor xr

I am now 46 and happy to report I have not been depressed for about two years.  I have tried prozac_ wellbutrin_ paxil and serzone.  I tried Effexor (not XR) 18 years ago and felt wonderful after the first week.  Couldn't continue due to severe constipation.  After many years of trying other meds finally found out about Effexor XR.  It has been the drug I have been searching for.  Even though I have insomnia (so I take it in the morning and take trazadone for sleeping)_ nightmare when I miss a dose (my family always knows when I miss a day for I am sure to talk and occasionally scream in my sleep)_ I also feel very shaky and unable to concentrate and will cry for no reason the day after missing a dose_ but I feel better than I have ever felt in my life.  I have been taking it for 8 years now and would put up with almost anything to keep this desire to wake up and live!  There was a time I would have rather been dead.  For me XR is more effective with way less side effects.  Don't care what long term effects may be.  At least I enjoyed life while on it.  Glory to God!,F,46,8  years,6/3/2009,Effexor xr

I changed to Wellbutrin_ and that was a BIG mistake.  I instantly reverted back to my depressive state_ and was completely unhappy.  I went back on XR_ and was relieved almost instantaneously.  My husband and I are wanting to get pregnant_ so my doctor recommended I get on Zoloft.  It worked better than the Wellbutrin_ but I felt fuzzy-headed and not myself.  I went back on the XR_ because it worked so well and determined that the benefits to me were worth the risk.  It is the only drug that works for me.  I now take it at night_ and that has helped me sleep and has lessened the drowsiness during the day.,F,29,2  years,5/29/2009,Effexor xr

410, 1, Depression,While on the medication I would experience painful shocks through out my body when I would miss a dose even by an hour. These shocks radiated from my forehead_ to my teeth_ and then the rest of the way down my body. They were so bad I would involuntarily turn my head. My depression never got better while on this. I experienced weight gain and loss of sex drive.,When I finally went to the doctor and demanded to be taken off of Effexor she started to slowly decrease the dose. Even cutting the dose in half caused me to have SEVERE shocks all day long. When I went down to taking none the withdrawl effects were so bad. During the first week I could not be around my 4 year old son because of extreme anger!! For the first two weeks I could not drive and could barely leave my bed. I constantly felt like the room was spinning. After about six weeks the withdrawl effects decreased. I have been off of Effexor for about nine months and I still experience withdrawl effects atleast once a week. I swear these shock effects never go away!! I would never recommend this medication to anyone. It nearly ruined my life. Please use serious caution with this medication. Feel free to email me_ I have been through it all with Effexor.

I had a loss of appetite on the drug (some days I would not even think about eating until 2 or 3 in the afternoon.,The one positive of this drug was that I lost 25 lbs in 8 weeks_ but I do not know if that had to do with the med or if it was a change in my diet.

I see my doctor tomorrow to discuss weaning off Effexor XR_ 150mg daily_ SLOWLY.  I need something_ but don't know what to ask my doctor for.  Many primary care doctors just don't know what to prescribe.  Please - what have you found helpful to ease withdrawal?  I can not go through withdrawal and take care of my children.  I physicaly will not be able.  Please responed ASAP with any help_ suggestions you might have.And I agree_ WHY doesn't the doctor educate their patient about side effects-withdrawal BEFORE the patient takes the first pill?

I have vivid dreams and just general feelings of being unwell.,The very first time I took them_ I felt amazingly clear headed. Everything was sharp and crisp. I felt hopeful_ things didn't appear to be hopeless any longer. I was calm and logical! Effexor XR is the only SNRI I can take. It helps with my type of depression. It's also amazing how it takes care of the swelling on the bottom of my feet from Periphial Neuropathy. I started on 37.5mg. Then I increased to 75mg and stayed there for awhile. Then I went up to 150mg. and stayed there for quite sometime. I started to feel overwhelmingly tired and more depressed_ so I weaned myself off 150mg back down to 37.5mg because I just didn't feel well on the higher dose. I think the 37.5 works best for me. When I weaned down_ I didn't have the horrible withdraw symptoms I thought I would. The only time I had the electric like (zaps) and crazy head feelings was when I totally missed a dose. You have to wean down on these slowly. I also changed the time of my dose too. Instead of taking it in the mornings_ I take them at bedtime to prevent restless legs. When I was taking them in the mornings_ by night time_ my legs would be so restless_ I couldn't sleep! All in all though_ I would recommend them.,F,58,4  years,4/16/2009,Effexor xr

Nothing was great_ nothing was terrible; everything was just OK.  I settled for Ok rather than being depressed.  But the weight came back and then some_ lack of interest in the outside world_ weepiness_ sleep problems and NO LIBIDO AT ALL.  I've taken 75mg and then doc increased to 150 during winter.

428, 4, severe depression,I started taking Effexor XR approximately 2 weeks ago. I started at 37.5 mg for 7 days and have now been taking 75 mg for 5 days. I felt euphoria for the first 7 days: I started exercising again_ my chronic back pain went away_ I organized my desk_ papers and finances_ I was able to finish some adminstrative duties that had been hanging over me for quite some time. My anger diminshed almost completely and my best friend commented on how I seem like my old self again. Prior to 2 weeks ago I had never been on any meds. My depression started as post-partum and then just blossomed out of control over the course of the last 2 years. After only 2 weeks on Effexor_ I feel like I have my old life back. I'm enjoying my daughter and life as a Mom like I never have before. I'm running again and dug my mountain bike out today for my first ride of the season. And what's really positive is that the pain I've had since being 5 months pregnant has pretty much all but disappeared since taking this drug,My psychologist pointed out that most people on website forums are people that are unhappy about their meds and have an agenda about passing on their warnings. So I'm on here specifically to provide a positive outlook. I am so happy on this drug right now that I am sad I didn't take it before_ or listen to my friends and family who said that I had 'changed' since pregnancy.

Six years later:  none unless I forget to take it.",I've been on Effexor XR for more than 6 years now and overall it's probably helped me 60-70%.  I go through phases of doing good_ and then not so good.  Diet_ exercise and taking the time to relax play major roles in how well I'm doing.  I also take klonopin 2-3 times a week when I feel overwhelmed.  Other drugs I've tried are Zoloft which made me extremely agitated and Luvox that I couldn't stay on long enough to see if it worked or not because I couldn't get past the headaches and nausea. I was on a tricyclic at one point with the Effexor and it made me feel like I was really crazy (very scary). I'm at 225mg/day and I'd like to wean down because of the side effects from not taking it but my doc says this isn't necessary and it's probably just part of my OCD that I'm worrying about being on the meds in the first place.  I wish they'd figure out what causes OCD already_ or at least how these meds work.  I feel like a guinea pig that no one can help sometimes!!!

After many years of having anxiety/depression I am now working with a therapist that helps me.  I think the first time I was on meds I thought it would cure me.  But it never did_ it just made me able to function_ but I wasn't truly happy.  Anyway_ I finally figured this out after many difficult processes.  I had to fix me and I finally found a shrink that was able to help.   My anxiety is lowering_ but I still stay on the Effexor for now.  I do look forward to coming off of it_ but for now it helps quite a bit.  I've already weaned down to 37.5mg anyway. The most uncomfortable thing about it is the constant dehydration and headaches.  Even after doing yoga I am dying and I can drink 5 glasses of water and only then feel better.  It's crazy.  I don't like the extra 5lbs either.  But whatever.,F,34,4  years,3/15/2009,Effexor xr

I gained a lot of weight while taking it_ but I think that had more to do with my lifestyle at the time than the drug itself (although anorexia is listed as one of Effexor's side effects - I'm still waiting for that one to kick in_ lol).  The only negative thing I could say about it is typical of all anti-depressants - if I missed a dose_ it made me horribly ill with headaches_ anxiety_ nausea_ bouts of crying... it was awful.

My movement is a little ""stupid"" at times_ much more expressive_ a little overly-relaxed_ and I say what is on my mind more often without thinking (unlike before).  At times_ its like feeling drunk_ without being drunk_ and people don't get my sudden ""out-there""_ openness.",I've lost my obessiveness.  I suddenly allow people in my house and can relax (never did this before).  I suddenly started having sex (after being celebate for 16 yrs) (TRUE! - DEPRESSING_ I KNOW!)_ and suddenly don't get nervous around other people (like men_ work collegues_ etc).  I hate and resent taking a drug to feel happy_ I worry about long term side effects_ but it made me able to deal with other (difficult) people in this world better without taking it out on myself.  My depression is almost gone.  My life has improved.  Effexor has been good to me.

The highest dose of Effexor that I took was 150mg.  It did a great job!  It got me through a really tough time in my life.

The feeling of disconnection from reality was quite intense at times. I believe these drugs are still experimental and should not be widely prescribed yet. The sale of these drugs are an attempt to ""cash in"" on as wide a variety of mental problems as possible.",Withdrawal from Effexor was one of the strangest experiences I have ever had. It was like there was a electroshock generator installed in my brain which would give me a jolt every 30 seconds or so. Also_ random electric flutter throughout my whole body was quite uncomfortable. These were the main symptoms which lasted aprox. 3 weeks after stopping Effexor. I believe taking this medication resulted in long term damage to my nervous system which I still deal with today. I would recommend against taking SSRI drugs unless your symptoms are unable to be controlled by any other means.

Then it seemed the low dose stopped working so we went up to the next level and that soon stopped working so we went up to the highest level which worked until my eyes were constantly twitching and I was completely exhausted all of the time. I went back down to the middle dose of 150mg daily and that worked better for a few months.. Now_ after a little over a year on this medicine_ my weight has ballooned up atleast 50 pounds in 4 or 5 months_ I have severe acne mostly on my chin (seems to be a common side effect from my research online)_ and I was_ once again_ unable to sleep and yet very tired all of the time and my anxiety was back for the most part and I'm depressed about my weight and the awful pimples.

Dry mouth!! slight constipation. I do have high blood pressure_ but I can't say if it is caused by the effexor or if it its just genetic,"I am very happy with my results from taking this.  I have been on 150mg for about 5 years.  It has kept me quite stable.  In the past year I have been having more mood swings_ and bouts of severe depression.  I was prescribed 75mg more_ I couldn't really tell the difference.  Now that winter is again in full swing_ I will be taking the extra 75 again.  I did try to stop taking it 2 years ago.  I was weaned off of it and still experienced the severe withdrawls.  Now I know what drug addicts go thru.  I would have givin anything for a ""fix"" of Effexor.  I switched to Wellbutrin for about 2 months and never felt right. I had to go back on the effexor.

BUT_ if I miss a dose all hell breaks loose.,After trying zoloft and lexapro with little or no relief_ I tried Effexor. I didn't really feel that much better until I got up to 225mg. I've been on 300mg for about a year and a half and I'm pretty satisfied. I suffered with severe depression for most of my life and was only diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder 2 years ago. I can honestly say that I haven't felt this good in over 20 years. BUT_ since I had gone untreated for so many years_ I do not actually know how an average adult is supposed to feel. I guess I'm still mildly depressed but it's a lot better than constant mood swings_ rage_ paranoia/anxiety_ panic attacks with vomiting_ crying/screaming until I hyperventilate_ constant thoughts of suicide and utter hopelessness and dispair. Only real problem is that I'm completely dependant on this drug and the withdrawal is unbearable.

Before I was on Effexor I was very shy_ while on Effexor I became overly talkative and outgoing and had every symptom of hypomania. I was socializing constantly and became obsessed with socializing. The hypomania lasted the entire time I was on Effexor. I exercised every day_ I did an hour of treadmill a day and still gained weight on Effexor. I did and said so many impulsive and embarrassing things while I was on Effexor that I never would have said or done before. The hypomania is very embarrassing after you get off of it and realize what you said and did.,I experienced hypomania for the first time ever on Effexor. It feels great in the moment_ but once I got off it_ it's really embarrassing looking back at the things I said and did on Effexor. I am so embarrassed now. I was told I was very manic on it and hadn't ever experienced hypomania until Effexor. I am so embarrassed now_ I made a total fool of myself on Effexor.,F,20, ,11/20/2008,Effexor xr

I shared personal_ random and weird things with tons of people. I gained weight even though I exercised every day. I did an hour of treadmill every day and still gained weight. I became manic and talkative_ my sex drive went up. I was obsessed with partying and socializing and became very manic. I just kept talking about random things and became overly friendly. I became so annoying and when I went off_ I was like a different person. It did relieve the anxiety_ but it turned me into this manic_ psycho social person. After getting off it_ it took a very long time to lose the weight_ lots of exercising and dieting to be skinny again. I was all into socializing_ partying_ I would talk about the weirdest most random stuff to people. It's so embarrassing.,My personality changed completely on Effexor and I said and did so many embarrassing things. I feel like a fool and am so humiliated. Everyone noticed how manic I acted on Effexor and I feel like it just put this new person into my body. It caused this severe personality alteration. Everyone I met on Effexor thought of me in a completely different way then people I met before and after Effexor. I was on some other drugs at the time_ though. Effexor has led to many embarrassing situations and revelations after getting off it. I was talking about the most random things on it and just became way over the top. It took away some moments in my life I will never get back. When I got off it I became a totally different person_ it was like my old self that I couldn't remember appeared.

So if you are having trouble sleeping I would give that a try before quitting.  I believe it takes a little while before you notice anything happening.  So far all I have noticed is  a loss of appetite.  But  I am wanting something that lifts my mood and gets a little motivation so I can function.  Taking it in the morning works best for me because it doesn't make me tired.  I have other meds for that.

I cant not name the amount of side effects i have.  Blurred vision_ headaches_ nausea_ IBS systems_ vomiting_ tired_ fever_ night sweats_ etc... all on top of the usual menopause symptoms.   I feel really sorry for my kids this week.   I have heard it can do wonder for those with depression and other issues but would never recommend for menopause.

I'm producing breast milk_ which makes my breast hurt and is embarrasing when it happens out in public.. i feel like im going through severe withdrawals even tho ive taken the med religiously..

Been on it again for 1 week and am going to discontinue again. Can't handle feeling like I stayed up all night doing cocaine or acid and sex drive is gone again.

However_ I'm now on 300mg and it's not working at all any more_ and I'm really afraid of withdrawal.

I still think back on it because treatments since (for mixed diagnoses of depression_ ADD_ or possible bipolar) are getting me nowhere. I quit Effexor twice abruptly_ as is not recommended_ and it was scary. (First I quit when I discovered I was pregnant_ and next because sexual side effects got worse after trying it again after other SSRIs and mood stabilizers). It's not the weird brain ""zaps"" and ""tracking"" that are troublesome with discontinuation--those go away--but the immediate plunging into a severe instability and nervous collapse_ resulting in a greater depression to dig oneself out of. When I am tempted to go back down that road_ I recall that is has no easy escape. this could be a good medication option_ but I think my diagnosis is inconclusive anyway (it's all trial and error; I think I am Aspergers with depression and irritability/anxiety and ADHD_ but this can look like bipolar so n",F,35,2  years,8/23/2008,Effexor xr

I have patched up a relationship that was falling apart and am able to focus more at work and accomplish a lot more every day. I am so happy I got through the first few weeks and gave it a chance. If you are having side-effects early on that are not life-threatening_ please try to give the drug some time as many or all side effects may dissapear.

For my depression I have tried Zoloft_ Paxil_ Lexapro and Welbutrin.  Effexor was the only one to ever work.  It saved my life.I would urge all readers of this site to consider two things before a patient opinion influences your decision about a medication.The first is that if you are having unbearable side effects_ call your doctor immediately and get off that medication.  It's not right for you.Second_ given that this is a patient-driven site_ it makes sense that most of the comments will be negative.

Been trying hard this week by alternating days that I take the 37.5mg as this is the smallest dose cant taper any smaller than this. Feeling the wicked withdrawal from such a small amount. The head rushes_ irritability_ the flashes do seem a tad hotter but manageable. How long would you keep this tapering process up and does anything help with the withdrawal symptoms?

Overall_ if you believe you need help for your depression I would recommend trying a different drug BEFORE resorting to Effexor. It has more side effects than most SSRI's and SNRI's. For me_ any benefits were greatly outweighed by these side effects.,F,28,3  months,6/2/2008,Effexor xr

I also have experienced some excessive sweating after being active. I do not sweat while active_ only when I stop. Sometimes I have difficultly focusing_ but not often. The withdrawal effects are quite substantial if I miss a dose. The effects are ""brain zaps""_ dizziness_ headaches_ sensitivity to light_ nausea_ shakiness_ mental confusion_ and difficulty focusing.",I have been wanting to get off of the medication for the past couple of years_ but am afraid of the withdrawal effects.

I don't think doctors should be allowed to prescribe this unless they take it for a couple months and then successfully get off of it.  Brain zaps_ watermelon head feeling_ nausea_ vertigo_ brain fog...the inability to care about absolutely anything - horrible.  I switched to Wellbutrin XL and it's been the best change ever....once the Effexor withdrawal finally ended that is.  Good luck to anyone trying to get off of this drug - if you're about to start it - you have to decide that you'll take it for the rest of your life - really did nothing for my mood either except for the total mind dulling - I was still depressed.

572, 4, Bipolar disorder,profuse sweating_ night sweats_ nightmares_ tics,When I was initially put on Effexor  at the age of 14_ I became manic_ which I have since learned is a common reaction to antidepressants for bipolars. Unfortunately_ my adoselcent psychiatrist didn't follow up with anything but Lithium at the time_ which only made me ill_ and_ consequently_ he misdiagnosed as clinically depressed. Since then I have tried dozens of psych meds and had many diagnoses. Effexor_ with the addition of the correct mood stabilizer_ has given me the most productive 18 months of my life. I'm able to miss a day or two with no ill effects_ but any more than that and I get headaches_ nausea_ and my arthritis pain intensifies greatly. There is not one single drug that works for everyone_ and this medication may not be the ideal; however_ despite some really irritating and consistent side effects and the potentially difficult time I may experience coming off of Effexor_ I would NEVER trade emerging from an almost lifelong depression_ partly thanks to this drug.,F,25,18  months,5/21/2008,Effexor xr

575, 2, Depression/Anxiety,High blood pressure_ anxiety,Effexor did not alleviate my depression or anxiety to any meaningful level.

576, 1, Depression/Anxiety,inability to focus_ loss of interest_ fatigue_ headaches_ weight gain(15pounds)_ and extreme nausea_ dizziness_ migraine_ and brain zaps when trying to come off drug.,In my opinion_ it's the worst drug ever. I started off losing a bit of weight due to a loss of appetite but then after the first 2 weeks I could hardly stop myself from devouring everything in sight. I ended up gaining 15 lbs.  Then came the blahness. I couldn't get motivated to do anything.  I quit several clubs teams that I was apart of at school because I was just too tired and disinterested to participate. My grades have also suffered. I also get terrible migraines that last for weeks. And the withdrawal is the worst. Just after the first day of not taking the drug I began to experience extreme nausea and dizziness. Oh_ and how can I forget those fun brain zaps! And after all of that it has only made my depression worse. My anxiety is under control but the side effects in this case outweigh the benefits.,F,15,4  months,5/3/2008,Effexor xr
577, 3, Depression,At various times throughout the 18 months I was on it I had them all_ I guess. I had weight gain (20lbs)_ night sweats_ extreme drowsiness coming on suddenly without warning_ flat emotions - didn't care about anything_ not even when my Mom had to have major back surgery_ tinitus_ vivid dreams_ gas_ and nausea and dizziness if I missed a dose by even an hour or two. Didn't notice any sexual problems_ though. Guess I was lucky there...,This drug worked pretty well to stop my depression. For me it just sorta numbed me out so I stopped caring about the stuff that bothered me. In the end I found the side effects were just too bothersome. After 18 months I weaned myself off of it very slowly. Well_ believe me when I say that the withdrawal symptoms are no joke. I would NEVER have taken this drug if I'd known just how awful you feel after stopping.,M,38,18  months,5/2/2008,Effexor xr

579, 3, anxiety_ depression,I stayed on this antidepressant the longest I've stayed on Celexa_ Paxil_ Elavil_ Prozac_ Buspar_ Tranxene_ Zoloft. It was a subtle medicine_ in that_ I never knew if it was working or not! But_ I kind of liked that_ because it allowed me to conquer my anxiety and feel real_ you know_ be the real me_ not some doped up version. I felt like me on this even though I still was a bit anxious_ it allowed me to work through it. No side effects that were disabling. Even when the dose was given higher_ I never noticed. My mom used it and said it did nothing for her. I kind of get that. It seemed a bit like that to me_ as well_ but then again_ like I said_ I liked that. I like to work out my problems and not rely on a pill to fix everything. And I was on this for years. It's a gentle medication. It was for me_ anyway.,,F,34,6  years,4/30/2008,Effexor xr
580, 3, Depression,increased sweating_ dry mouth_ twitching_ 'brain zaps'_ inability to orgasm_ worsening of anxiety eventually_ insomnia,I was on 225_ I kinda crashed when I went to 150 (with psychiatrist approval); I went back to 225 but have_ by counting granules_ gotten to 187.5.Benefit: Lifted me out of most of the depression_ numbness was nothing next to Zoloft (fluoxetine).Bad stuff: Dry mouth_ sweats and twitching are all mild enough to put up with. Brain zaps are also okay because they're rare and mild unless I miss a dose. After a year_ I noticed my anxious habits (nail biting etc) were getting out of control and I was more anxious than I had been before_ and it took ages to get to sleep. Sex drive wasn't too dented; without getting too graphic_ I would be aroused enough for sex_ but orgasms are veeery difficult. Advice: Go on it for less than a year_ and when you go off_ go very slowly & monitor whether you're getting miserable again (diary is good).,F,20,16  months,4/28/2008Email,Effexor xr

Those feelings and thoughts have totally diminshed and i am a much happier person and have a positive outlook on life thanks to EFFEXOR XR_ i would reccomend this medication to be at least trialled_ as this medication has been a true life saver.,F,38,3  years,4/26/2008,Effexor xr

I am now on Wellbutrin ( awesome ) but I am still on effexor and have decreased my dose which makes you feel outside of yourself. I did not take any of the effexor yesterday as I hope to just take Wellbutrin but I am even having trouble typing these comments because I did not have a dose of effexor in the past 24 hours. Not a good suggestion for depression.,F,37,6  months,4/24/2008,Effexor xr
583, 1, bipolar depression,The drug caused me to have NO sex drive and NO emotions.  When I should have been crying_ I had no desire.  The side effects of coming off this drug are hell.  Obviously I see this is a very addictive drug as far as withdrawl symptoms.  Even tapering the drug_ I have had SEVERE dizzines and SEVERE nausea.  No one can prepare you the side effects when you decide to stop taking it.,The Effexor did work for my depression while taking Lamictal.

Weight loss in the beginning because of no appetite but that was good because in February I had to have a 4th stent in a heart artery so the weight coming off was a plus. Sex? Ha! Non-existant!  My wife is on Celexa so we are ""some partying couple!!!  I have been on it for at least 5 months this time at 225mg per day (150mg morning/75mg afternoon).  It has helped ease the depression but I am still at a stage where I don't feel like doing anything and have trouble thinking with accompanying memory loss problems",If I had a choice_ I would like to be off of it because of one obvious side effect but I am afraid of the depression coming back as it has before.  I sleep ok but I take 2.5mg of Xanax at night to help.  So_ all in all_ the medicine has worked to a point.  Maybe I am expecting too much from it.  In retrospect_ I think I have had a lifetime of depressive episodes with anxiety and irritability.  I just never got any help until 1994.  Childhood trauma_ I'm sure_ has something to do with it all.  Everyone is different with these types of meds so for me Effexor XR is just OK_ not a miracle but certainly a help.,M,59,5  months,4/21/2008Email,Effexor xr
585, 5, Anxiety_ Severe Depression,I am very fortunate to be one of Effexor XR's success stories.  The drug was incredibly effective for me.  Effexor XR coupled with a strong hunger for God helped save my life.  The side effects weren't too bad at all:  a minor case of tinnitus that was noticeable only at bedtime_ decreased libido but manageable_ and somewhat of a flat mood that made me reticent.  But the benefits FAR outweighed the side effects.  I am very grateful.  I first tried Lexapro for 4 days_ which had wicked side effects of nausea_ vomiting_ insomnia_ etc._ then  I switched to Effexor XR and it made all of the difference....a night and day difference.  The best part was that I was able to keep my mental acuity while taking Effexor XR_ which I needed in my job.,I don't have anything to prove what I'm about to type_ but reading through the posts it appears like maybe less dosage would be better for most if not all folks.  I only took 75 mg which was a tremendous sweet spot for me...I'm certain that anything stronger would have lead to the bad side effects that most experience and write about.  For full disclosure_ I also used small dosages of Xanax (0.5 mg per day_ on better days I cut the Xanax in two and only took half of it) along with Effexor XR 75 mg 1x/day_ and the two together in these smaller dosages were tremedously effective.  Withdrawal wasn't a problem but I did go slowly by tapering down to a week at 37.5 mg before quitting completely and timing it such that days 4-6 that I was off of it occurred during the weekend away from work...withdrawal took about two weeks.  Hang in there_ life will get better!,M,43,5  months,4/18/2008,Effexor xr

For first week: jaw clenching_ tremors_ akathisia_ mild manic state_ racing thoughts and speech.,I've been on and off Effexor XR 3 times in the past 3 years.  Each time I take 75mg for about 2 months_ then stop.  I do not taper off_ and only experienced mild to moderate withdrawals.  Most notable were a euphoric/slightly manic state on day 1_ with vertigo and electric sensations on my skin (not brain zaps) for the next few days.  It felt like I was slightly intoxicated.  Also some headache and nausea_ but nothing too severe.,F,22,2  months,4/18/2008,Effexor xr

I completely lost my sex drive so my doctor switched me to Effexor XR today.  I start 37.5mg tomorrow and then up to 75 in a week.  After reading all of these comments I am a little nervous about it_ but I am going to try it because I really want feel better ALL the time.  I don't have insurance and I am a little worried about the cost_ can anyone help me with a place I can get a good deal?  Thanks.,F,23,0  days,4/18/2008,Effexor xr

I'm happy_ all the time but it hasn't helped anxiety at all. It hasn't effected me sexually_ but if I miss a dose it's best to stay as far away from me as possible_ it's extreme and I wasn't this way before the meds.

I have been weaning off extremely slow. I reduced from 150 mg to 112 mg to 75 mg to 37.5 to 18.25 to 12.5 to where i am today at 6.25. At each interval I have stayed there for 3 weeks. Only real problem was going from 75mg to 37.5 where i experienced deep depression for about 3 days but it did subside.

592, 3, Mental and Physical breakdown,I have been on this drug for 2 years and am now trying to get off of it.  Unfortunately_ it's becoming harder with each passing day to not take a pill due to the side effects.  I am always dizzy_ to the point where I throw up several times a day.  I get these shocks in my brain that cause numbness in the lower part of my face and lips.  I can't sleep and when I do I sweat and have strange dreams. My memory is shot.  I can't seem to recall things I have done the previous hour.  My anxiety and panic has been agrivated and returns without warning.  My weight gain was horrible.  I went from 140 to 200 in a very short period of time and I wasnt even eating.  I seem to shake uncontrollably and I am so restless that sitting still is not an option.  I use to enjoy going to movies_ now I hate it because I cannot sit still.,This drug did it's job to help me recover from my breakdown_ but Trying to ween myself off of this drug has seemed to cause more to be depressed about.  I am afraid to drive because of the dizziness. I can't walk a straight line.  I have no memory .  I just want off the drug and it feels like I will never be able to do so.  This alone causes major depression.,F,37,2  years,4/14/2008,Effexor xr

I didn't even realize how bad off I was until I took this_ and I bounced back within two weeks.  I just increased from 75 mg to 150 due to extreme stress_ life changes_ and hormonal stuff hitting me all at once.  After suicidal thoughts I asked my doc if I should increase the dose.  Until my job messed up my life I'd been doing quite well on 75 mg for 5-1/2 years except one period when I experienced grief at the loss of a family member for a few months.  I am calm most of the time_ but not dead inside.  I would laugh_ cry and have all range of normal emotions.... until the work thing hit and I had trouble coping.  I hope to get back to 75 mg after I can make some positive changes in my life.  Glaucoma runs in my family and I dread having to stop this med when I get to that age_ not because of the side effects but because it's worked so well for me.

594, 4, Social Anxiety_ Depression,Brain zaps the day after a missed dose,It's helped the depression a great deal_ but the anxiety less so. I'd experienced the brain zaps a few days a month for a while_ but only put them together w/ the fact that I'd forgotten to take the Effexor the day before I experienced them. 'Brain zap' is a broad term_ but for me_ I can feel my pulse or some other non-painful jolt in my fingertips_ head_ and_ oddly enough_ my soft palate; I feel very tired_ and dizzy when I stand. Laying down mostly mutes the zaps_ but the only cure is to take Effexor as soon as I can_ even if it's earlier than I would take it in the day.,F,20,8  months,4/10/2008Email,Effexor xr
595, 4, Depression_ social anxiety,"""brain zaps""_ extremely vivid dreams_ increased insomnia_ lower sex drive which fluctuates_ manic feelings.",The main issues I have with this drug is I find it can cause insomnia and obviously severe and unpleasant withdrawal.  Some side effects such as brain zaps continue even without missing doses.  White balls present in stool which I at first mistook for tapeworms and it freaked me out since I work with animals and worms are a common hazard.  Once I realized it was XR Effexor balls it made me wonder why they weren't dissolving and if I was not getting the full effect.  Don't be discouraged by the side effects reported by other people_ I tried many other medicines before this and found them useless and was very skeptical about depression medication until I found this worked.  Obviously the benefit should always outweigh the drawbacks_ if your depression is mild than maybe this is a bad idea.,M,28,2  years,4/10/2008Email,Effexor xr
596, 5, anxiety/panic,I had very few side effects going on the drug.  Head felt a little weird the first couple days and experienced a little nausa.,Currently I am on Effexor XR 75mg.  I went off because of the price and switched to plain Effexor_ 2-37.5 a day.  I experienced a significant amount (20 lbs) of weight gain.  I faithfully work out and don't eat a lot.  I have since gone back on the Effexor XR 75 mg hoping that it will go generic soon in the US. I've been on it just two weeks_ and have already lost 5 pounds.  The first time I was on it_ I wasn't hungry and lost weight too.  Effexor XR has been a god send for me_ I was withdrawing from family and friends due to a medical scare and I had to do something.  I know all these comments from others might scare you_ but for some of us... it works with little to no side effects.  Take this from someone that fought with her doctor to not take meds.  Good luck to all of you.  We'll be just fine!!!,F,39,9  months,4/9/2008,Effexor xr

There are reports about how people get addicted to it and feel ""brain zaps"" when trying to go off.  As Effexor is my third anti-depressant_ it's worked the best and I'm sick of shopping around.  Even with the side effects_ which aren't too bad and more just annoying_ I can deal.  However_ I worry about the day when I decide to go off of them and determine if my depression is more chronic or clinical.  I've gone a few days before without taking it and felt dizzy_ tired_ nauseous_ and spacey.  I'm afraid that the mild addiction will be enough to keep me on them forever_ even if I show signs of recovery.  Also_ if I'm on them forever_ that could be bad news if I decide to have kids (in the way future).good news: there's a generic coming out_ meaning it doesn't cost $10 a pill (before insurance) sometime soon",F,20,4  years,4/8/2008Email,Effexor xr

Then I went through a whole range of a bit nauseaus_ a bit diarrhea then constipation and such.  After treating each thing in the first few months it leveled off and it is fantastic!  I do consider this a lifetime drug though.  I have cut down a couple of times very very gradually but the horrible depression came back with a vengeance so I'm a lifer and loving it.  I do take a bit of Valium to help me sleep if needed and found I could cut my caffeine content down also or I get too hyped up.  Basic bottom line is that it works.  I got discouraged when I read people's side affects but finally hooked up with a nice girl who loved it and she helped me through the beginning. I'm so grateful and hope I can help people also.,Work up to the dose very slowly and if you ever want to stop_ do it so slowly that you almost don't know it.

My doc has suggested dropping to 112.5 for 3 weeks_ then to 75 for 3 weeks_ and so on.....but I think I'll start by breaking up the 150 mg capsules and removing a couple of grains per day.  I did forget my morning capsule once several months ago - for 1 day I felt fine_ so I deliberately didn't take it the second morning.  I was snappish and irritable all day and a bit weepy.   On the whole the Effexor had the desired effect of kick-starting my recovery.  My opinion may of course change depending on how the withdrawal goes.

However_ over time_ the side effects outweighed the benefits_ switching to Prozac.  I've wanted off for years_ but withdrawal symptoms were too severe.  I've had unexplained hives for 2 yrs.  Doc didn't believe my hunch that there was a link to effexor.  My new doc is weaning me very carefully and the hives are subsiding but still having horrible emotional problems coming down.Even before the hives_ the exhaustion_ weight gain and lack of sex drive put a lot of pressure on my marriage.  Lethargy so bad that I needed 10 hrs sleep/night & a nap every day.  Hard to hold down a job and have a healthy marriage w/kids.  Overall_ great for short-term use_ but wean carefully -- it will likely cause suicidal thoughts as you come off!,F,40,9  years,2/20/2008,Effexor xr

645, 1, Chronic back pain,Severe changes in my personality. Developed anxiety with anxiety attacks occuring daily_ if not up to 3x/day. Developed feelings of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. Withdrawal from friends and family_ loss of self esteem and confidence. Not wanting to get out of bed in the morning. Bursting into tears for no apparent reason_ and not being able to control myself from hyperventalating...or getting myself to calm down.,I do not recommend taking this drug if you are not clinically depressed. I WAS NOT depressed before starting this medication. My doctor put me on this anti-depressant because I have chronic back pain due to moderate scoliosis_ 2 bulging discs_ and arthritis. She told me that pain causes depression_ and depression causes pain so this drug should break the cycle. Within the first 2 weeks of starting this medication I have seen major changes in my personality. I have developed anxiety with anxiety attacks since starting this medication. I did not have anxiety prior to starting this medication. I am now taking myself off of this drug(under the supervision of my doctor) in steps_ which is making the anxiety and depression worsen. I do not want to get out of bed in the morning. I do not want to go to work_ see friends/boyfriend_ have sex_ or do anything socially engaging. My self esteem has all but dissappeared along with my self confidence. I now burst into tears with nothing triggering me,F,19,5  weeks,2/20/2008Email,Effexor xr

It's a little choppy_ as it was difficult to keep track of at the time. thurs. pm. - missed dose int the am_ and took tonight after a ridulous rage episode.   Than at about 2 am I felt better_ but was still upset about the event earlier. I looked on the internet for answers. And I got some. I decided to quit cold turkey.  days 1 and 2 - feeling very strange_ nervy and squirly_ sort fo light headed. tingly feeling in my lips _ that spreads down kind of like ahead rush. I can feel these epidodes coming on. Starts out like gerbil wheel starting to spin in my head. Then it turns into feeling of steady light electrical shocks.  day 3 - terribly crying episode this afternoon lasted an hour and a half.

Due to the heroin type side effects trying to get off this VIRAL Stuff.  Geeze what a market.    I told my doctor how bad it was. Theye really didnt care.  This drug was driving me crazy.  They told me deal with it and keep taking it unless i felt like commiting suicide. Then I could get an appointment right way. Otherwise no I would have to wait for 3 weeks for an appointment. How CRUEL!I just wanted off it. He said do not try to go cold turkey. Now I know why. The effects are deadly. Some people have had seizures according to what i read on the web. He had no answer about the side effects i was having. He acted like it was the first time he heard of it. I think that was BS! I think they get kickbacks on certain drugs they push.!

Orgasm was either severely delayed or didn't happen at all... if i could get over the lack of sex-drive. Initially lost 5 lbs_ gained it back in double.,been on effexor xr 150 mg for a little over a year. feel significantly better than without it. no more pressing depression or sadness. it made me extremely tired_ initially_ and i slept constantly... which was okay_ since i was suffering from insomnia and lack of concentration before i started taking it. Orgasm eventually came back... thank god... though_ my girlfriend wasn't complaining.I recently built a tolerance to the 150mg_ so says my Dr._ and i've been upped to 300mg... which isn't helping with my concentration and has made the insomnia return.,M,26,1  years,2/14/2008,Effexor xr

Minor symptoms include dry mouth_ maybe constipation_ maybe eye dilated_ maybe loss of appetite_ but hard to tell if from med. nothing serious and imo worth it.,Effexor has changed my life. Nothing else I tried worked for my anxiety like it. Depression is gone_ and now can function and deal w/anxiety in life like I couldn't before. Now I feel like a normal person that can interact and live life. Absolutely wonderful experience for me. I would recommend close monitoring with doctor (I had cell and it helped to be in close contact w/her) especially at start and end of treatment and not missing doses. I know it has to be tapered very gradually when getting off.,F,21,2.5  years,2/11/2008Email,Effexor xr

Hope it settles out and helps me feel better.,F,32,1  days,2/11/2008,Effexor xr
655, 4, depression/nerve pain,I was initially on Effexor and slowly got up to 100 mg a day.  Was on this for several years_ had back surgery and wanted to quit Effexor because I was no longer depressed or in pain.  Withdrawal was very_ very difficult as many here state.  I ended up staying on a maintenance dose of half of a 37.5 mg tablet.  After a year or so on this I had more spinal problems and related nerve pain.  Upped the Effexor to 75 mg without much pain relief.  I now switched to XR 150 mg for the past six months.  I have lots of neck problems (DDD_ herniation_ stenosis_ etc) so I thought the severe pain in my hands and arms was the result of that.  HOwever_ in thinking about when the pain increased_ I realized that it coincided with my switch to a higher dose and XR.  To compound the problem_ I was put on Diovan 160 mg for high blood pressure at the same time.  So I don't really know if the increase in pain is related only to the Effexor XR or Diovan also.,"Overall_ Effexor did very well relieving my depression.  It helped keep migraines at bay and I had tolerable_ minimal side effects.  But getting off of this drug is really nasty.  I had to d/c my meds a few days before a neck myelogram and had a very bad reaction to the lack of Effexor in my system.  My pain increased tremendously and I was a basket case emotionally with crying_ etc. I had to go back on the Effexor and make an appointment with my prescriber to find something to cover me for when I have the myelogram. I had the ""typical"" brain zaps and odd brain feeling_ dizziness_ anxiety.  I would love to d/c this drug forever once my neck problems have been taken care of.",F,52,7  years,2/8/2008,Effexor xr

I tried weaning off with my doctor's help and still came back begging for more to get rid of the echoes in my head and the dizziness.  It is awful to try and get off this stuff.  I really think I could do without it but I cannot stop taking it because of all the effects it has when trying to get off.  Does anyone else get the echoing and dizziness when you do not take it or not enough or try to wean off?  Help!  Wish I never started this crap.,M,55,6  years,2/7/2008Email,Effexor xr
657, 2, depression,- night sweats- intense nightmares- rapid heartbeat- weight loss- loss of appetite- loss of sexual desire- waves of dizziness / brain weirdness- severe hives over my entire body,It's really too bad about this. I was thinking the other day that it was working out okay_ despite the side effects. I was willing to put up with everything except the hives.  I'm about to stop taking it because apparently once you get the hives_ they don't necessarily go away for months or even years after you go off Effexor.  And let me explain why the hives are so awful - it's not just a few itchy patches.  It is all down my arms_ legs_ and sides.  They are worse at night_ and I've even started getting them on my face.  Last night_ I had so many hives on my face that it looked like I was wearing a misshapen lumpy mask.  It's itchy and embarrassing.  I was on the drugs for about 6 months before the hives showed up.,F,29,6  months,2/5/2008,Effexor xr

I've not experienced any of the side effects I've read about on this site as well as others.,This medicine has saved my life_ literally.  I have attempted suicide on two different occasions_ my last attempt was Jan 6_ 2008.  I slit my wrists and my husband found me 15 minutes later.  My psychiarist put me on Effexor XR that very day at the hospital.  I have NEVER responsed to the other anti-depressionants as well as I have Effexor XR.  I've been on Paxil_ Zoloft_ Prozac_ Wellburtin and Lexapro with very limited success.  With Effexor XR 150 mg I have a new life!  I see my doctor every week and she is monitoring me very closely.

I can't remember a time in my adult life when I've felt so able to control my emotions_ I can put my worries into a mental dungeon with a thought.

It was different each time because I started when I was 15 and I was changing so much during those years. It helped with depression and anxiety_ though it does make me feel apathetic sometimes. The side effects are different each time_ except for the weird dreams. I have been on 150mg for 2 months. I felt invincible at first_ but now it is less effective. The worst side effect is definately the fatigue. This drug really alters your brain. It is dangerous if you are not careful.,F,20,4  times,1/31/2008,Effexor xr
664, 4, Anxiety_ minor unipolar Depression,Side effects include euphoric feeling in the morning_ jaw clenching_ feeling of tiredness about 6 hrs after each dose but this is mild.  I do not have withdraw symptoms if I miss a dose.  I did however have a craving for sweats when I first started the drug but I just resisted the urge to eat them which seemed to break the cycle of compulsions.  Libido is fine_ but in some instances climax takes longer_ o well.  Also I should say that I had trouble focusing when I started taking Venlafaxin in higher doses this persisted for a very long time_ and at times I felt as if I had ADD.  This however isnt the case but I did feel as if I had to concentrate harder to both remember information and focus on completing complex comprehension task.  Basically it made it hard to study psychology until I learned how to concentrate very hard on what I was doing.,First off Ive been studying psychology for about 5 years now.  Im far from a doctor but I know more than the average Joe.  I started taking Venlafaxin after trying to come off Tramadol often called Ultram.  Ultram gave me horrible withdraw symptoms which I had trouble getting over and this caused me a lot of anxiety_ it should be noted I started taking tramadol due to a lower back injury in my L4 L5.  After starting Venlafaxin it took about a month to really start working for me_  Im a 175 pound healthy male.  I dosed up to 225 mg over the course of 3 months.  After about 5 months I noticed the efficacy of the drug was starting to fade although I didnt need the drug as much as I normally dont have major bouts with anxiety.  The drug did level me out meaning I was able to think more objectively about situations before responding to them.  The drug also made me flat at times but not so much that it was impeding my life.  Ive been taki,M,23,8  months,1/31/2008Email,Effexor xr

During the treatment I noticed that I was tired all the time but my doctor didn't attribued this symptom to the medication. During the treatment_ it was painful to go to school due to the lethargy that I was experiencing_ I was continualy walking in fog. After 2.5 years of torture_ I decided to taper off gradually from this medication. The withdrawal symptoms was a NIGHTMARE!!! Flu-like symptoms_ fatigue_ skin sensivity_ sensivity to all noises_ chest pain_ tachycardia_ very bad digestion (unable to eat without having a bad reaction). More than one year after the withdrawal_ I still have all these symptoms!!! I cannot work or function at all!!! I tried many drugs after that to repair the permanent damages due to this hellish drug like: Paxil_ Celexa_ Cipralex_ Remeron_ Risperdal_ Seroquel_ Seroquel XR and Zyprexa and for my somach: Pariet_ Pantoloc_ Nexium_ Prevacid_ Losec_ Pepcid and Zantac.

667, 4, Depression and anxiety,Initially I had dizziness and some naseau. I found taking it at breakfast reduced nausea. I have found I sweat more on Effexor. No massive weight gain yet. Most annoying side effect is delayed orgasm and sex drive reduction.  While the mind is still interested the body does not have the tingling all over like it used to before sex.,Often get restless legs syndrome with Effexor. Appetite has improved but not to the point were I am emptying the pantry like their is no tomorrow. That is good! Some antidepressants make you so hungry.

Seriously_ if you can get through the first few weeks (I actually had to miss a few days of work because of how sick it made me)_ it's well worth it.

Maybe for me it is the combination of the two but I have not experienced any of the negative side effects others have described.  The ones I did experience certainly wouldn't make me stop taking it.

The cost of it_ outside of my health insurance_ is almost 6 times the cost I pay now ($20 per 30) at Costco. I've also been seeing some insomnia lately_ which I wonder if Effexor isn't responsible.

The only complaint that I do have is weight gain.  I have gained significant weight while taking effexor but cannot say it is entirely from the med.Alot is also from going from being very active to less active and   a  sweet tooth plus stress eating.  Although I am not glad about my weight gain_ it is far better than living under the black cloud of depression. I did try Welbutrin_ but it did absolutely nothing for me and felt like I was not taking anti-depression medication at all_ so went back on Effexor.  My dr did suggest that I not take my 75 mg dose in the afternoon and see if it helps with weight loss.  I thought I would have side effects from missing the dose_ but so far I have not.

I always tell my doctor_ please don't start anyone_ because once they get started_ they'll never be able to stop.  It's like a narcotic.  The nightmares are the worst for me.,F,44,5  years,1/17/2008,Effexor xr
686, 4, Anxiety_ depression,Mildly bored and apathetic.,Don't let some reports of horrible withdrawal symptoms prevent you from trying a very safe medication that is extremely useful for many people. I felt the withdrawal symptoms if I missed a dose big-time - but big deal. And trust me_ I felt them - the electric shock sensations - but they're nothing to be afraid of and I have severe panic disorder! You'd think a person with panic attacks would fear these sensations immensely_ but if I can deal with them_ anyone can. And when you do withdraw completely_ it has to be done very slowly_ like I did_ and I barely felt any of those sensations because it was done properly. When I took it_ I felt like a really calm_ functioning human being - maybe two panic attacks in two and a half years of taking it. Now_ since I quit taking it almost six months ago_ my panic attacks are back - daily panic attacks. Effexor worked really well for me and I am going to go back on it because I know it helps with my panic and anxiety symptoms. It is definitely worth,F,29,2  years,1/17/2008,Effexor xr

Since the doctor said I shouldn't expect a difference for 2+ weeks_ I was a little surprised that there were initial_ noticeable effects in 30 minutes. But these were mostly the side effects_ and real improvement in my depression didn't appear for the suggested two weeks. I've been on it for several months now_ my life is greatly improved_ I handle work stress much better_ I handle my kids much better_ and for maybe the first time in decades_ I understand what real happiness is. My only complaint is that so much of my life was so subtly but truly less fulfilling than it could have been. I've reevaluated everything based on this experience.

I dropped from 150 mg to 75 mg without substantial side effects. When I dropped from 75mg to 37.5_ all hell broke loose. I experienced this weird brain zap_ where it felt like an electrical current was bouncing around in my head. I had severe panic attacks; way worse than when I was initially diagnosed. I suffered from heart palpitations and horrendous headaches. My doctor prescribed Lexapro while I attempted to drop from 37.5 to zero. I was evil to everyone near me in the morning_ and cried for no reason every night. He put me back on 37.5_ removed the Lexapro_ and added Prozac.

I also had thoughts of suicide.  When all this is happening_ you're not sure if it's withdrawal or if you really are going off the deep end.  That's why these testimonials are so critically important and why the doc and drug manufacturer should go out of their way to tell you NEVER NEVER go off the drug too quickly.

That happened three times_ and the effects of those three times will be with me the rest of my life.  The rage was about things that I normally would find annoying_ but only momentarily. I quit trying to get off it_ but am about to try again after another 3 years on the drug.

Switched to taking it right before bed so will sleep through the tired phase. Am taking 225 mg.  Still occassional anxiety but much better.  Coping and attitude have improved.

BUT_ hated the physical side effects_ I took valerian (okayed by doctor) to offset the insomina - but weirdest was I realized only after I went off it how it affected my eating habits - I put on weight - around 10 lbs - in the 2.5 months on it - no impulse control and ""munchy"" syndrome - this was counterproductive as I had lost a lot and putting it on made me depressed!  Withdrawal was odd - first 2 days nothing_ then the third day_ waves of nausea_ headache_ dizziness... Day 4 and 5 and now (Day 6) DEFINITE brain zaps - didn't know what people were talking about until they started - NOT nice ... and I was only on 2.5 months - overall - DOES do what it is supposed to do - you need to weight whether it is worth the side effects",F,51,75  days,12/12/2007,Effexor xr

Along with other trials (Lovan & Luvox) it helped me reduce my emotional dependence on alcohol. Except for the sexual side-effects I would've given it a better try.  Today is day 4 off it (and I stupidly didn't reduce it slowly) so I feel like I am at the start of a severe fever.  Dizzy_ nausea ... make sure you TAPER OFF IT when the time comes!

744, 1, depression_ suicidal thoughts,Inability to gain an erection without significant physical stimulation from partner; even then_ orgasm was infrequent.  I began to get twitches that felt like bodily electricity_ which was not only startling and uncomfortable_ but also led to me developing an incapacitating social anxiety that used to be only nominal_ and i still retain a modified form of the latter two side effects to this day (it's been a year and a half).,I firmly believe that it should not be approved for medical use unless some method of effective test is made to make sure that it won't worsen your state while you're on it_ but even more importantly_ after you get off of it. I had to begin taking a different prescription (Lamictal) to counteract the side effects that it gave me for a couple months longer than I was on Effexor XR_ and now they are TOLERABLE_ but I still feel a social anxiety unlike anything I'd ever experience before... When I get nervous (which is often) my body will literally move in coordination with other people's bodies... I used to describe it as if vague_ kind of abstracted strings were pulling me and everyone else around me in accordance with eachother.  When I told my doctor that he most likely misunderstoof and thought I was exhibiting schizophreniform symptoms_ when in reality_ I didn't believe in any of it_ it was merely the only way I could describe the sensation.,M,20,4  months,12/8/2007,Effexor xr
745, 5, Bulimia/Anorexia_ Depression,The first time I took effexor_ I felt like I was a paraplegic.  I could not move_ think_ did not want to eat (weird because Im bulimic)_ and I slept in bed all day_ did not want to exercise_ felt pain in my joints_ horrendous headaches_ sometimes i would feel these odd sensations in my brain which felt as if I was being electrocuted.  This was at a dosage of 37.5mg and happened the first week.  So after telling my doctor_ he transfered me right away to zoloft_ which did absolutely nothing for me.  I had faith_ so I went back on effexor_ and the side effects I had experienced before_ were no longer present.  I increased my dosage to 75 mg. This started to help me feel much better about myself_ the world_ and I became less depressed over all without the severe side effects I experienced before.  Last week I increased my dosage to 150.  I feel so much better_ I can get up in the morning and go out and continue on normally with my day instead of being completely miserable.  Food does not c,I am pleased_ so far with effexor.  I dont think that I could continue with my life if i hadnt taken any SSNRIs.  It really helped me...and continues to do so.  I feel really hiper and happy sometimes_ which is GREAT_ and I am pretty much back to my old self again.  For other information as to what medication I have tried that did not help:-zoloft: worsened bulimic episodes_ made me edgy_ no improvements_ felt the same even at 150 mg. -celexa: do difference what so ever_ i stopped cold turkey after two months_ nothing happened.-prozac: wow that made me so suicidal that I started writing a book on ideas of how to commit suicide. IT WAS NUTS! Bad experienceBut then again_ it depends on the person: everyone reacts to these types of medication differently.  It takes a while to find which medication works best for you.

749, 5, YES,Slightly blurred vision. Minor constipation. Dizziness. All these resolve within two weeks. HOWEVER: you must taper off this med very slowly. Cut the tablets in smaller and smaller dose. It takes me at least a month to come off this. Know this going in and you'll be fine.,As a depressive_ this med is a very powerful weapon in the toolbox. I use it to halt downward spirals that tend to end in clinical depression. I have abuse issues from my childhood that can trigger serious feelings of pain and abandonment. Once that gets going long enough I get depressed as well (there is a difference between emotional pain and actual depression).  Now I just start up the Effexor and go to just 75 mg.  Within exactly 11 days I pull out of the emotional slide and I'm fine. After that I stay with it for a few months and taper off SLOWLY. Essentially I'm off meds about 75% of the time and this tool has eliminated any fear of future depression. I am very fortunate to find something that works so well_ so fast and at such a low does.  I take 20 mg of Prozak in the winter for SAD because Effexor is just to strong_ taking away my feelings. However_ in a pinch_ Effexor kicks in faster than the SSRIs.

The last week  was 37.5 mg.   Bad idea!!   I have been off for 5 days and it has been extremely difficult.  I feel dizzy and nauseous and very tired.

As far as discontinuing Effexor_ I have done this several times in order to try other agents or to test my libido ( as a matter of fact_ my libido soared when I DC'ed Effexor_ but I was a nervous_ miserable wreck_ so I went back to it.) the key is to wean yourself off slowly. Open up the capsuls and take half of one if you are taking 75mg or if you are taking 150 mg cut down to 1 capsule or 1 and 1/2.

I was prescribed Effexor for that. At first it gave me racing heartbeat_ and vivid dreams. I was only prescribed 37.5mg. It actually took a long time to get rid of the panic attacks. I had them all the time for about 6 months_ then slowly they stopped. This medicine actually inhibits the panic attacks from becoming severe. I would still get panicky_ but definitely wasn't as bad without the medicine. Sometimes situations will arise where I'm anxious_ but definitely no anxiety for no reason. It is something you have to stick with_ its not a quick fix. It does take time for it to work. The really bad thing about this pill is the side effects if I miss just one pill.

It was indeed effective for me when I began taking it. After being on it for a few years and discovering the withdrawal symptoms if I missed a dose I figured I would be on this medication for life. But recently (now that I have been feeling 'normal' about life for years thanks to effexor) I am noticing side effects. At first I thought all these side effects were seperate issues. It never occured to me they could be from my precious effexor. I looked up Acne and Effexor on Google and it led me to this page and others. After reading other people's experiences I realize that my time with Effexor should be up (well it probably should have stopped 2 years ago).

If one has a history of taking various antidepressants for years_ I do not advise Effexor XR.  Particularly in dosages of 150mg a day or above. Side efffects too debilitating.

My normal hearing is somewhat obscured by the pulse signal while it is occurring.4.Withdrawal symptom: Ability to fall asleep is severely hampered. Head shaking from side to side wakes me as I am about to sleep_ multiple times before sleep eventually comes.5. Withdrawal symptom: Depression_ confused thinking and action_ lack of ability to concentrate.Withdrawal symptoms only occurring on last reduction step 75mg-0mg/day. Withdrawal period for me was about 2 weeks,1.Advisable to take off work if you are withdrawing.2.Inability to concentrate and dizzyness due to inner ear disturbance may also pose a danger.3.At beginning of week 2 I was offered Prozac/fluoxetine 20mg. I took 1 that day and 1 on the next. Slept well after the  2 doses. Other withdrawal symptoms also dissapeared within hours of the initial dose of fuoxetine.

My current doc agrees that it's one of the hardest meds to come off of_ and promises that if we taper_ it will be slower than crap.  He felt I'd been trying so many different meds that didn't work_ and that I hadn't been on a high enough dose of Effexor in the past for it to be effective... so far_ seems to be helping keep my mood more stable but I do notice a kind of deadening of emotions- I know that was a concern of mine before when I took it.

The only thing I really dislike about the drug is the increased sweating which occurs at various intervals during the day.

891, 4, anxiety / OCD,I have been off and on this medication a few times over the past 6 years. I definitely gain about 10-15 pounds on it (but not as much as I did on the SSRIs).  The weight comes off rather quickly when I go off it.  It also dulls my sex drive_ making it much harder to orgasm.  Other side effects include dry / less vibrant skin_ some fatigue (although managable)_ and dry mouth. (My dose has been anywhere from 37.5 mg for several months to 225 mg for several months -- even the lowest dose is somewhat effective but the higher dose is even more effective - but the side effects are more pronounced at higher doses).,I've tried almost all of the antidepressants for anxiety and some minor OCD tendencies and in my opinion_ effexor is the best of its kind. It really changed my life for the better in many ways.  I am extremely upbeat and positive when I'm on it and also a lot more productive and focused.  It does not affect my ability to think straight at work.  In fact_ it increases my ability to focus.  On the flip side_ I hate the weight gain and the other side effects.  They are definitely from the medication as I've been off it and on it enough times to be sure of this.  I do think the side effects are less at lower doses so I recommend staying on the lowest dose you can.  Withdrawal is not as bad as people make it out to be if you taper the medication.  Yes_ there are a few days at the end where you feel a bit flu-like but it's not that big of a deal.,F,33,6  years,8/13/2007,Effexor xr

Switched to Lexipro - worked for a couple months then the anxiety/anger problems started again. Switched to Effexor XR 75 mg 6 months ago. No side effects and the depression and anxiety are gone. I have felt normal on this drug. Accidentally skipped 2 doses and the feeling of shocks in my head/ears scared me big time.

When I did have sex or even when masturbating_ orgasm was very difficult to achieve and ejaculation was weak when it finally arrived. At the same time there would be semen in my urine_ or sometimes an emission of semen by itself when defecating. Very low energy: I've been unable to accomplish much_ and when I had to take about a month off from exercise due to illness I was unable to resume my routine_ which had never been a problem before. There's been some weight gain_ presumably resulting from lack of exercise rather than the drug itself. I'm currently weaning myself off it_ and had brain zaps and vertigo when I cut back too quickly.,This didn't really do a thing for me. My mood lifted for a while_ but that seemed to be because I had an unusually interesting project at work_ which would have naturally lifted my mood anyway. As soon as it ended the anhedonia returned to what it had been.,M,43,6  months,8/1/2007,Effexor xr

It basically stopped working overnight and my doctor upped the dose to 225mg.  After 3 days on 225mg my anxiety was unbareable!  I went back and he took me off of it completley and replaced it with Wellbutruin.  It's been 7 days since I've stopped taking it and it's been a living hell. I know it's not he Wellbutruin as I've have researched it on the web and know people who have taken it with no problems. I would describe Effexor XR as being drunk 24/7 plus having the flu at the same time.  My dr. told me that it could take up 3-4 weeks for it to completly be out of my system and has given me Valium to get thru the next couple of weeks.

I was truly happy and stopped purging and maintained a healthy diet of 1400 cals with exercise for about 6 weeks.  Despite the diet and exercise_ I gained 21 lbs in those 6 weeks.  Suddenly without any explanation I became more depressed than I ever felt before I took the drug and began feeling suicidal to the point of throwing away all of my possessions and selling my car.  I have never felt so low.  I stopped taking it immediately and the withdrawal has been horrid.  I am a marathon runner and I suddenly couldn't make it more than 5 miles from a raised heart rate and shortness of breath.  My skin has broken out in cysts and the weight I gained won't budge.

It has dramatically improved my drepression_ and removed my mood swings about 99%. I had dramatic weight gain (about 45 pounds in 7 months). After week 1 I began to feel like the person I was back in my 20's; like I was back in reality after being away for a very long time.  For this_ I give Effexor an A+++. I began taking it after being married for 8 months. I too feel this saved my marriage. My husband thinks this drug is a Godsend. I am trying to find other ways to deal with the delayed orgasm & lack of sex-drive because emotionally it takes a toll on my enjoyment of sex and willingness to participate.

Then I tried Wellbutrin for a while_ but it gave me panic attacks. So I tried Effexor. This drug has given me more energy. Things that used to make me uncomfortable seem less intimidating now. I am able to go out of the house more often_ and I have less paranoid thoughts. I have also been able to get more exercise which I used to never have the initiative to do. However_ about a month or so after I started taking it_ I suddenly went off of it_ foolishly thinking that nothing would happen--do NOT do this!

It really helps my OCD a lot.  It improves my mood_ helps me focus_ gives me confidence_ and really gives me a more positive perspective on life.  It is a lifesaver in many ways.  However_ I really hate the fact that it is harder to control my weight on it.  I also hate the fact that I can't orgasm on it.  I am an overachiever and it takes away some of my drive which is also bad.  Adding wellbutrin to it did help counter some of the side effects (especially adding it to 35Mg).  Overall_ I really recommend giving it a try because everyone reacts differently to these medications.  Also_ the withdrawal is not that bad if you taper it slowly.  I have gone off it 3x now and tried other things and as long as you don't go cold turkey_ it's not as bad as people make it sound.,F,33,6  years,7/18/2007,Effexor xr

This medication pulled me out of that_ it was slightly effective against dysthymia but not a cure for it.  The ""discontinuation syndrome"" aka WITHDRAWL_ lasts for about 3 weeks_ and during the first week you are extremely sick.   Weigh the pros and cons against your own situation_ but if you are desperate - like I was - anything is better than being severely depressed.  Also_ don't plan on taking this medication for life as people seem to build a tolerance to it. For the long term - try alternative forms of medicine and make sure your doctor tests you for EVERYTHING that could be causing your depression - it is not normal to feel depressed all the time - no one will take the bull by the horns except yourself.

I have taken so many different drug I cant even name them all. I lived in hell until the fifth doctor I tried finally changed my diagnosis from Bipolar to Depression and prescribed Effexor. Since taking this medication_ I have discovered a life I couldnt have even imagined. Although I still take other medications with the Effexor I know that without it I would not be the same.

After about 9 months that better than normal wore off and I was left anxiety free and feeling normal.  I quit after about 2 years.  I ran out of my percription and was to lazy(one of the side effects) to get it refilled.  I quit cold turkey.  Some will say that the withdrawals are absolutely hellish and they would be right.  But for me after 2 days of cold turkey the brain shivers went away and I felt pretty normal-if not a little cranky.  Now the problem-my anxiety came back.  I have tried every non drug remedy there is and they do not work in my case.  So after beingeffexor free about 1 year I started taking it again.

In the long term_ it has helped me find myself again and indoing this i am able to return to work after loosing my job. (long story_ but i should have taken it to the unfair desmisal board). Fianlly and most importantly_ i am strong enough to start trying for a child again after having several miscarragies (early in preg.). Although i am having side effects coming off the medication i am glad i did something about my problem.  BUT I WILL SAY THIS: ""REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING BEFORE GOING ON THE MEDICATION AND GOING OFF IT. MAKE SURE THERE IS NOT ANY OTHER WAY OF HELPING YOURSELF BEFORE GOING ON ANY ANTI-DEPRESSANT AS ITDOES MESS WITH YOUR BODY AND YOU CAN'T JUST DECIDE TO GO OFF THEM OR HAVE A FAMILY OR ANYTHING THAT REQUEST YOU TO BE OFF THEM"".

Standard treatment after chemo/radiation is 5 years of Tamoxifen_ which put me into early menopause...it was ugly!  My oncologist put me on Effexor after I told him I couldn't stand myself and didn't know how anyone else could stand me either!  Worked well for the 5 years I've been on it (except for weight gain and loss of interest in sex...my poor husband)_ but the withdrawals now are HELL.

Only side effect before that was dry mouth which was minor.  Doctor thought the Effexor was causing the headaches and switched me to Paxil (headaches went away_ then came back daily again after 2 months of taking Paxil - have been on Paxil for 5 months and am tapering off it now).

It's changed my life. It's like I have instant coping skills. Stuff that used to agitate the heck out of me_ causing me to have many physiological stress problems_ now just doesn't bother me in the least. It's made me see how much my own attitude was causing problems in my life. Thank you_ Effexor! Good luck to all of you out there struggling with this kind of thing.

975, 4, anxiety/depression,EXCESSIVE weight gain and sweating,I've been on Effexor XR for 4 years now_ 225mg.  It completely alleviates the anxiety which is one reason why_ after gaining 100 lbs and enduring disgustingly excessive sweating_ I'm still taking it.  After three years of calm_ I'd hoped to slowly get off the drug to see if I could manage the anxiety myself(and wanted to lose some of this weight as it exacerbates my arthritis among other problems.)  I went through a long period of tapering off with no trouble.  However_ two days after going from 37.5 down to nothing_ I had flu-like symptoms (dizzy_ vomiting_ diarrhea_) deep depression and uncontrollable sobbing.  After 4 days of this I went back to the doctor for more Effexor.  Three doctors later_ the first I've heard of these side effects was today_ looking them up on the internet_ and it appears that nearly everyone trying to get off Effexor goes through the same thing_ and it lasts a long time.,F,41,4  years,6/17/2007,Effexor xr

1007, 1, IBS,"I have been on this drug for three years and have been having what I felt were ""fainting spells""_ but in reality it may have been seizers. I have dizziness_ hot flashes_ heart ""flutters""_ no sex drive_ restless legs_ nausea_ sleepy most of the time_ shoulder tension_ dry mouth at times_ can't get out in direct sun light (causes dizziness and/or fainting spells)_ can look into blinking lights_ headaches_ etc",I really wanted to make people aware that no matter how long you are on a medication side effects can occur later into taking it. I was shacked when they told me that it was all side effects including the seizers. That is scary when all is well and bang you are hit with this. Just be careful with this and all medications. Do not ever feel like it is dumb to bring up what might be a side effect to you doctor_ it could be (even three years later).,F,32,3  years,6/1/2007Email,Effexor xr
1008, 5, anxiety/ panic attacks,very vivid dreams_ sweating_ it is very hard to reach climax,when i first started this medicine 9 months ago- I felt like I was going crazy. I prayed to feel normal again. I was always in a daze_ dizzy_ panicy_ inability to sleep but doc and girlfriend kept urging me to give it a chance. Now I am normal again. Hardly ever experience the anxiety anymore. Has definitly made things better. I don't want to be on effexor forever_ but right now it is working great and like our Lord says 'do not borrow from tomorrow_ today has it's own trouble'. To all the people that keep saying 'DONT EVER TRY THIS DRUG'- that's not fair. I know alot of people who take Lexapro and says it works for them like effexor works for me. But when I was taking it_ first time in my life I had ever thought about suicide- and i am not suicidal or depressed and never have been. HMMMM? could it be that every one is different.

1010, 4, GAD,First few weeks on effexor 75 mg_ worked very well little side effects except insomnia. As time progressed almost 6 months now I am weaning off the medicine_ it has helped a lot but side effects are horrible as a 19 year old. NO SEX DRIVE_ Weight gain from 120 to 132 in 6 months. Where on wellbutrin I lost weight_ down to around 110 I normally weigh 120. VIVID dreams recently. As the doses lower now I am feeling the withdrawl symptoms of sadness_ unexplained crying and such.

Restart did same on 75 mg. Restart on lowest dose 37.5 OK.  Now: Little tingles and still slight blurred vision but nothing like before and SEX OKAY!!! (couldn't say that much with the depression),"Effexor has saved my life. Literally. I recently came home from the hospital after a suicide attempt during a profound chemical postpartum depression from 2 back-to-back miscarriages.  I've dealt with depression since my abusive childhood_ but this was by far the worst. I have now ""failed"" on all the other classes of meds_ so it was Effexor or shock therapy.  I was willing to put up with a lot at that point. MAJOR POSITIVE EFFECTS for me are that I can now move and think and talk at near-regular speed_ I have facial and voice expression again_ I can give and receive love_ and I'm actually alive and not planning my next suicide attempt. There's no substitute for that.  My husband and my 2 year old daughter are also darned glad this medicine exists. Effexor produces more remission than any other modern antidepressant (I actually DID do the research)_ and it's #1 for PPD_ but it's still a chemical and not a guarantee.  I_ for one_ am VERY glad it was an option. Rough start aside",F,36,1  months,5/28/2007,Effexor xr

Many responses I see deal with the side effects.  They were pretty considerable at first_ but went away once my body adjusted_ which was about a month or so.  It has helped me a lot.  I was so tightly wound_ and having anxiety attacks all the time.  Now not-so-much.  I like it because I still feel things_ I am not completely numb to the world_ I cry_ I can laugh_ and I can get mad.  I was really worried I wouldn't knowing that Effexor treats anxiety and depression.  Anyway_ let the medicine adjust to your system.

I am now weening off the drug and that is also not good_ but I am feeling more myself and in control instead of zombie like. Doctors said this was normal symptoms and I periodically would try to get off the effexor but found the side effects of that worse at the time until I finally had enough and decided to go through the withdrawels and end the effexor for good.,,M,36,2  years,5/22/2007,Effexor xr

The negative obsessive thoughts playing over and over in my head have disappeared completely.  I have not experienced any sexual side effects. I was on a 100mg dose of Zoloft prior to taking Effexor and it completely crushed my sex drive. I no longer have that sense of dread every morning and I am able to handle the stress of daily life. I would definitely recommend Effexor XR.,M,32,1  years,5/20/2007,Effexor xr

My anxiety is not daily_ weekly or even monthly a regular occurance for me so I do not know how well the effexor helped this problem_ haven't had anxiety prolblems in a very long time.  However_ I went off of effexor while on vacation and had been off of effexor for about 4 months.  The reoccurance of horrible PMS symptoms has made me decide to get back on effexor_ it is a Godsend to be without PMS syptoms!

I dont see how dizziness_ fatigue_ grossly dialated pupils and a limp dick are meant to improve your condition....I seriously recommend something else...just through the last of mine out.

He just said take the rest of the pills you have then stop. So I took 75 mg for like 3 days then I stopped. I got so sick_ every time I ate I got all shakey and sweaty and thought I was gonna puke_ so I'd lay down and fall asleep. I was so tired and nauseuos_ then I got super dizzy_ like I was dizzy then a huge surge of dizziness rushed over me_ if I moved my eyes weird even. God it was awful_ so I called and they said I was having withdrawl_ and I'm on 37.5 for a week then 37.5 every other day for a week. God it sucks.,F,17,4  months,5/16/2007,Effexor xr

Although I still experience these side effects when upping my dosage they all go away after two weeks.  I still have mild depression and anxiety_ but it has been the most effective treatment for me.  I've found that no matter what the medicine is you never really get to the point of being symptom free.,If I am late taking my pill I experience withdrawal symptoms within an hour of my missed dose.  Once I start feeling dizzy and nauseous it's too late.

My once productive life was reduced to counting the tiny beads out of a capsule trying to appease my body_ but yet still work towards getting off this stuff over weeks.  I was so dizzy and nauseated I could barely stand from the withdrawal.  The drug clears your body rather quickly_ it's that you have to retrain your brain to function without it.

The strange ejaculations stopped after about 3-4 months and unfortunately the vivid dreams subsided around the same time (for the most part;)).  If I had to say a few negative things about this drug they would be that I feel dependent upon the drug_ but being dependent upon the drug is WAY better than experiencing anxiety.  The other thing would be that missing a single dose ruins my day because I am incapable of doing anything productive while I am dizzy and shaking.

Then I began sleeping ALL THE TIME. About a year and a half after that_ the doctor decided it was the effexor_ and I was switched to SSRI after SSRI... until finally I was ordered a sleep test and it turned out I had VERY severe sleep apnea_ and there was evidence that it'd been around for a while.

1063, 5, Anxiety,When I first began taking Effexor XR_ I experienced some bad dreams_ very tired_ nausea; it felt alot like the flu.  BUT here is my advice.  STAY WITH IT!  The symptoms are only your body getting used to the medication.  The sympoms occur anytime there is a dosage change; down or up.  The good news is this. THIS MEDICATION WORKS GREAT!,I've take this medication for over a year now and had amazing results.  The highest dose I took is 75mg 2X per day.  This gave me a VERY even feeling.  I felt normal for the first time in many years.  In combination with this medication I've been seeing a psychologist.  I've learned to talk myself down from the anxiety; so now I have reduced my dose to 37.5mg 2X per day.  I had a few withdrawal symptoms for a few days_ it felt like the flu.  Also it kind of felt like my axiety was returning; but just like my doctor told me that was just the dosage change.  Sure enough I feel fine again!  I will hold at 37.5mg 2X per day for about three months then drop the daily dosage to 37.5 1X per day for another three months; and then off all together.  REMEMBER any dosage change will create symptoms; RIDE IT OUT! The symptoms go away!  This is an awesome medication that gave me my life back!,M,42,1  years,4/30/2007,Effexor xr

Before taking this medicine I couldnt leave the house for about 2 years_ suffering from panic attacks that controlled my life. The only real down fall was the low sex drive and unability to orgasim. But now the drug seems to be wearing off. I'm starting to have panic attacks again and anxiety and racing thoughts that make me feel like I'm gonna go crazy. I would really like to get off this medicine and switch to something else- Hopefully something that will take care of my anxiety and not kill my sex drive. I'm really scared to get off the drug though. My advice would be to those seeking info about the drug. IS that all drugs work differently for everyone.

My doctor wanted to increase the dose to 125 mg_ but I decided that 1 month on this medication was enough_ so I started the withdrawl process (for two weeks).

I get palpatations occassionally throughout the day_ not everyday_ thank goodness_ and my eyes have become to feel pressure behind them.,I would not recommend this medication unless you absolutely have to have it.  I am going to stop taking the medication_ because I feel the same way with the medication as I do for the last three days that I have chosen not to take it.

I lost over 50 lbs in the last 6 months just from lack of eating or throwing up what I did eat. The doctor knew I was on Steroid inhalers and a smoker when not pregnant_ but did nothing when my blood pressure skyrocketed but double my dose. I had to stop working because I work in Tech/IT and I couldn't stare at a computer screen or focus my eyes without becoming violently nauseous. Horrible vertigo -- I felt like I was always in a bad hash high and scarily disconnected from my body. I started S/I again for the first time in years while on Effexor. It all finally came to a hilt after not taking 2 doses under doctors orders New Years Eve because I knew I would be drinking. Full blown hallucinations - slipped into a dissociative episode and called the cops on my husband thinking he was a boyfriend who died almost 10 years ago and trying to kill me.

1106, 4, Depression and anxiety,Sedation (had to start taking it at night); decreased libido,Effexor alone was only somewhat helpful for me for anxiety and depression. I had to stop taking it in the morning and start taking it at night because it makes me sleeply. Now_ I take 300 mg. daily in combo with 30 mg. of Remeron. The combination is a godsend. It ended an adult lifetime of torturous anxiety and periodic bouts of morbid depression. I sleep like a baby_ wake up feeling fine_ experience a normal range of emotion during the day_ have good concentration and mental clarity_ and am loving life clean_ sober_ and awake.  Effexor and remeron together are powerful medecine_ if you can make peace with them.  The only drawback to remeron is a battle against weight gain (see remeron ratings for more info.) And_ the decreased libido with effexor is a hassel. But_ living virtually free of fear and depression is worth the effort to compensate for the side effects_ in my experience.,M,41,14  months,4/4/2007,Effexor xr

My Dr. bumped me up to 150 mg. and I still felt tired and agitated.  I was then bumped up to 225mg and I started feeling a bit better but was still experiencing depression_ agitation_ irritability_ and being tired.  My Doctor bumped me up to 300 mg of Effexor and 150 mg of Wellbutrin and this was the solution for me.  It took 6 months on this dosage for me to feel completely like myself again but every day was a better one.  I have had a very good experience with effexor and with it and my Doctor my life was truly saved.,Effexor XR did not cause me to gain weight in fact_ I actually was able to lose weight.  However_ I think that is due to the fact that when I am depressed I tend to overeat and when I'm not depressed I can manage my diet in a healthy manner. I highly suggest that you find a Psychiatrist that you feel comfortable with and who understands how the medications work. For the first 6 months_ I worked with my Doctor once a week to insure my dosage was proper as we were both committed to making me healthy again.  I can now check in with him every few months but no matter what I know that he is just a phone call away if I have any questions or concerns.  I would also suggest that you include your loved ones in your treatment as they will notice things that you may not.  It's important for your Doctor to have complete information to be able to help you.  I know that this may not work for everyone but it has been a godsend to me and I am very thankful!,F,40,4  years,3/31/2007Email,Effexor xr

Once_ the doctor mistakenly gave me regular Effexor (not XR) and its calming effects did not last as long.  I could tell the difference.  I lost my temper.  I felt shakey.

Later I was forced to quit that job and my back collapsed.

I highly recommend that you do not make any life changing decisions until you and your doctor see how this medication affects you at the onset of taking this drug.  This adversely affected every aspect of my life - personal & financial. Never had thoughts of ""suicide"" only thoughts of ""suing"" the pharmaceutical company. Note that this happened at the onset of taking effexor and I had no warning of this type of side effect.  I take effexor xr 75mg daily - truely do not know if I still need it.

If I go more than two hours past my dose_ I can't even see straight! My lips become numb. It's horrifying!,I hate Effexor XR. The only good thing that's happened from taking it is now I realize my anxiety & depression are not as insurmountable as I thought - being on Effexor IS! I am down to 37.5mg/day and hope to be completely off in about a month. ONE WEEK since I decided to go off Effexor and I realize what it has done to my life! I see the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Don't take it - it's very nasty and you will regret it. Go for a run at the park - it feels great!

Missing a single dose sends my brain into mini-seizures_ or brain shivers_ which produce migraine-like headaches... lasts until hours after I take the next dose. Have also had to supplement with Imipramine due to anxiety. (I've also noticed a weird increase in my blood sugar sensitivity_ and find myself getting tired and much more irritable than usual if I skip a meal.),It saved my life -- BUT -- if you have never taken street drugs before_ I would NOT recommend this drug. It's potency and side effects can be a nasty surprise for anyone who is taking it for mild depression. THIS IS A LAST RESORT DRUG. It should not be tried before other anti-depressants have been tried. It's been working wonders for me so far_ after two other kinds failed... but I was debating suicide at the time. Sexual dysfunction is always better than death_ though_ so it's been no contest for me. DON'T QUIT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. The drug doesn't even start working for the first three weeks_ so grit your teeth_ put up with the nausea or premature ejaculation or whatever and let it do it's job. If the side effects are worse than the depression_ you're on the wrong drug. Easy as that. And DUH- withdrawal is gonna suck.

Over a 2 month period of itchiness and hives I thought I had developed an allergy to something new b/c I had moved. I had been on the drug for over 8 months and my doctors ensured me I would have experienced an allergy to the drug months ago.  I kept taking it. I only discovered it was effexor when I lowered the dose and my lips and mouth would swell 30 mins (on the dot) after I took my pill. I eventually weaned myself off of it but it was so hard because of that tingly/light headed/electric shock feeling you get from withdrawl (I've seen a lot of comments on that from other people...weird).

Miss or decrease your dose and within 5 hours_ your brain is left ""abandoned"" and going haywire!  *****  I found Effexor fixed my depression (major depression_ suicidal) within one week- to the point that I felt totally detached from everything and everyone.  Not sad_ not happy- just like I didn't care.  I stopped calling/emailing/seeing people.  Wanted to drop therapy where before I was totally attached to my therapist and would never dream of leaving.

I feel like I'm wearing an electric shock collar and someone keeps pushing the button. I am so desperate to get off this crap that I am taking the capsules apart and counting the granules_ trying to wean off one granule at a time. Naturally_ my doctor parrots what the drug company says. ""This is not a known side effect."" ""I've never heard of it being as severe as you say."" Yada yada yada.

1233, 4, depression,"The electrical sensation that someone mentioned is generally from ""withdrawal""; Effexor (even the XR) has a very short half-life_ and as the concentration decreases during the day_ the ""electric shocks"" increase; for me_ it's particularly noticeable when I turn my head (e.g._ backing up a car)_ and when I'm tired.  I take the Effexor XR in the morning and at lunchtime_ and my doctor and I recently added 10 mg of Prozac in the morning.

1247, 3, Severe depression_ organic based,The withdrawal is exactly what is described. It is unfortunate_ but  probably quite true that the brain itself changes to adapt to this drug_ which in the case of this particular toxin (all psychoactive medications are_ theoretically_ poisons -- not mine but a Stanford M.D.'s words) -- I have begun the process of accepting that the changes will have some permanent effect_ one of which being the inability to be free from the symptoms withdrawal brings with it should I have to stop taking the drug.,I_ too_ like a few others have been taking effexor xr since it was initially released. In the decade or more of experience I've had_ the dose I take daily is 300mg. I don't suffer from high blood pressure.  The organic chemistry of my brain leaves me at a disadvantage for producing the right amounts of neurochemicals. Effexor keeps what I make available longer and that's added consistency and stability to my sleep_ appetite_ movement_ etc.. Effexor xr has been the one medicine that has helped but even it has proved to be limited over time. I would not recommend this or any other drug like it to anyone with a mood disorder or any other condition except perhaps one that is already disabling. I am glad it was available as the best choice at the time_ but 10 years ago_ the doctors dismissed us when first describing the agony of stopping or missing my prescribed dose.

I am going back on Effexor this week after 1.5 years without.  I am cautious because although Effexor made me feel confident and uninhibited it eliminated any self doubt_ a small amount of which I now realize serves an important funtion in life.  I will closly monitor my ability to self evaluate and make reaonable decisions this time.  When I was last on this drug_ allot of risky financial mistakes and overconficence at work led to becomming unemployed and broke.

Also_ it made my insomnia worse - I was not able to sleep at at all.  The worst effect was the constant feeling of agitation.

1262, 4, GAD,Zero - Dry mouth in the beginning.,A lot of people on anti-depressants worry about weight gain. I truly believe the weight gain is a result of general overall well being and feeling better.  When on anti-anxiety the anxiety in your body decreases_ and perhaps the metabolism slows down.  You feel better so you want to eat!!!  I have zero side effects from this med_ but I also have a high tolerance to side effects.  Also_ if you read all the threads and side effects_ and have an axiety or obsessive personality_ of course you're going to think you're going to have all these side effects and_ in turn_ your body will respond by_ indeed_ producing the side effects you read about.  I have been on Effexor for 5 years.  I believe it has done all it can do for me and I need to dive into my true self and also help myself.  There is no 'happy pill'....these anti-anxiety meds simply take the edge off....YOU have to do some congnitive work as well.

It was an out of body experience.  I jumped up to see if I was awake_ and if I stayed floating in the air_ I knew I was having the out of body experience again.  Then I would float down the hall.  It was like being in 'The Matrix'.  If you think this sounds fun_ guess again.  It was terrifying.  (The dreams happened say within a year of stopping Effexor.  I can't prove this was a side effect of taking Effexor_ but what else would it be?  I read some other posts that prompted me to think it was the Effexor.),Simply too dangerous to try it.  If you have an addictive personality you will find it difficult to quit.  If you MUST take an antidepressant_ at least consider another one.

Kind of like lucid dreaming.  Sometimes they were quite entertaining.  Other times they were absolutely terrifying.  Either way_ I was waking up at 4am every morning like clockwork and would wake up every subsequent hour.  This left me extremely tired and_ with a full time job and a four year old_ unfunctional at times.  Oh yes_ I took this for anxiety...the feelings in my stomach went away but I found myself getting very paranoid and very angry where at one point I felt like running as fast as possible into a wall to stop it all.  For a brief moment I felt like ending it all.  Other than that_ upon reading other comments_ I think I did experience a lack of interest in sex and it was more difficult to have an orgasm.  No weight gain but loss of appetite,I took effexor once before for anxiety and post partum depression.  After 3 weeks of crazy dreams and all the rest_ as above_ I stopped it cold turkey and experienced 'withdrawal' (they call it 'cessation symptoms' how nice)_ which was the same as the start up but the dreams were very very negative and the lethargy was and still is an issue. I am not waking up in the middle of the night anymore_ I dont feel any symptoms of anxiety which is why i took it in the first place_ no paranoia_ but I'm still dealing with the feelings of utter anger.  I talked to my doctor and she said I should never had taken it for anxiety.  My mother took it for depression and anxiety and she had a really hard time getting off it.  My final comment?

Hope the comments help and good luck.,M,28,14  months,12/11/2006,Effexor xr

1274, 2, depression_ and stress,weird dreams_ dizzyness ... the WORST = stoping it .. u get weird shocking sesations in your body_ not pleasant. NO sex drive AT ALL. You feel less emotions which is good for some_ but when u hurt someone_ and then u get off the medication and realise...u feel emotions. Be very careful_ I dont recommend this at all. I even woke up several night drentched in sweat_ and I have a good physical endurance. I can run for 45 mins without sweating that mnuch. There are possibilities other than drugs. See your psychologist.. and if he or her recommeds it... then that person is trying to notdo their job.,Please... its not worth it .. its the worst thing ever. I'm not being sarcastic either.

Started at 25mg for the first two weeks and I'm only at 75mg. I don't know if my doctor will keep me at 75mg or go up yet because I'm also taking 100mg of Lamactil for bipolar (hypomania). It was rough for the first week and a half but then most of the side effects wore off. Overall I think my depression has lifted_ so this combo seems to be working for me. I was worried I'd be emotionally flat_ but I still have a full range of emotions. I was also worried that I was sleeping about 12 hours a night_ but now I'm starting to get my regular sleep back. The only downside is that there's no generic yet.,M,34,1  months,12/10/2006,Effexor xr

After 2 weeks_ all side effects were gone.,I've been on a 150mg dosage for a year now.  I can honestly say this drug saved my life and made me normal again.  I knew I was reaching the end of my rope and even though I knew my nervousness and anxiety was 'all in my head' I couldn't get my brain to shut it off.  Effexor has successfully done this for me!  The only downside was after several months I seemed to be suffering from ED.  I still had the desire but could not make love to my wife no matter how much I wanted to.  My doctor gave me Cialis and that has worked like a charm.,M,38,1  years,12/3/2006,Effexor xr
1281, 4, Depression & anxiety,Blunted affect_ apathy_ initial weight loss_ followed by weight gain_ drowsiness_ severe withdrawal symptoms_increase in blood pressure,Effexor worked really well for me when I was in the pit of law school despair.  It pulled me up and made me feel like living again.  It curbed my anxiety_ but it also made me pretty apathetic about things that would have normally excited me didn't get a reaction -- like having an entire glass of wine spilled on me.  I initially lost about 30 lbs_ but regained about 50 over the course of a couple of years.  I tended to be sleepy on Effexor in the beginning_ but that tapered off.  The worst side effect of Effexor is the withdrawal symptoms -- brain shivers_ irritability_ inability to focus_ nausea_ you name it.  My advice is take it very slow -- I found that opening capsules_ counting out X number of specks and licking them off my hand (and gradually decreasing them) greatly reduced the symptoms.  Granted_ you'll feel like a junkie as you do that_ but you'll manage to get through the day.  Overall_ if you're in a deep depression or very ridden with anxiety_ Effexor will probably pull you,F,28,2  years,12/3/2006,Effexor xr

This is the worst antidepressant ever_ have tried lex_ zoloft_paxil and prozac. The only one that seemed to work was prozac-although it stoppped after awhile_ will try again. Effexor has done nothing to alleviate the anxiety; in fact it makes it worse. I decided to quit cold turkey and don't believe the hype- you will experience brain tremors for a little while _but they are nowhere near as bad as quitting prozac_ b/c prozac's half-life is soooo long.

By the 18th day I had such a panic attack driving home for work that I drove right to the doctor. He gave me effexor xr and I am to start it tonight. Does anyone else take it for anxiety?

I am currently on 225 mg a day. It took every ounce of my being to try each day to get my feet from the bed to the floor. I knew I was in trouble so I called my doctor. He tried me on Wellbutrin...didn't work after 2 weeks I went back and he put me on Effexor XR. I was and am a new woman. I have no sexual problems_ no nightmares basically no problems at all.

Perimenopause.  My OB/GYN prescribed the drug for me when I broke down during a routine visit and couldn't stop crying. After being on for about 10 months_ I started forgeting to take the pill at the same time or would accidently skip a day.  I found that I would become severely dizzy and felt sick.  I actually thought I was having symptoms of a heart attack.  I now take it at the same time every day (75 MG in the AM so I don't forget)and haven't had any bad side effects.  Generally keeps my anxiety in order_ and I don't overreact to simple bumps in the road any longer.

I was tired all the time_ not thinking very fast or clearly_ and going through emotional swings.  Reduced to 112.5mg - experienced about 3 days of side effects tapering the dose_ however_ this is much better.  Can function very well_ still a little tired_ probably from waking at night.

The side effects increased anytime a dosage change was made (increase or decrease in dosages intensified the side effects with some homostasis but all side effects were always present).

Dreams were a bit off.,Given that the high dose seemed to mess me up at the beginning_ but did have a positive effect in the next two days_ I spoke to my doctor and we moved me over to Wellbutrin and about 5mg of Effexor per day.

There is occassionally a bit of a 'buzz'_ but I learned that happens when I have coffee within an hour of taking the Effexor.Now I am thrilled.  I went through 5 years of lowered productivity until I realized it was depression.

I hardly ever cried while on the drug as opposed to crying all the time (I am very sensitive and tender-hearted).,"I really enjoyed the calmness that I experience while on effexor. I was able to think more rationally and calmly with out worring so much about everything. The feelings that everything was going to ""blow up"" even though life was going well seemed to vanish. I was more equipped to handle life's curve balls that was hurled at me more efficiently. My husband's insurance was cancelled and weening myself off the med. seemed the obvious answer. I felt as if I traded some things to get emotional relief. I traded my sex drive_ assumed higher B.P. and weight gain_ just to get a calm state of mind. Coming off of effexor has been a trip in itself. The feeling of ""brain shock"" is really a strange sensation. I feel dizzy and sometimes out of control. Like a movie that has been put in fast forward for a few seconds. Then I am ok.

Sleepiness and bouts of sleeplessness extreme lethargy developed diabetes type II high blood pressure and was hospitalized twice when trying to ween off of the drug.,No one ever told me even as I was seeing my psych and psychologists weekly_ and my physician_ that what I was experiencing could be from the drug. They just said I was severely mentally ill and needed hospitalized and more and more medication. At my second involuntary hospitalization I refused all psych meds and miracle of all miracles I FINALLY GOT BETTER. 5 months drug free and no more hospitalizations ps both my psychiatrist and my psychologist dropped me during my last hospitalization. Said I was too severely ill for them to help me. NICE! But I've gotten better ever since.,F,45,5  months,8/24/2006,Effexor xr

1374, 2, Anxiety and mild depression,My doctor is getting me started with Effexor XR very slowly. She gave me the usual sample pack containing a weeks supply of 37.5mg capsules and a weeks worth of 75mg capsules BUT also gave me 3 more 7 day strips of the 37.5mg. She told me to take 37.5 mg a day for 3 weeks and then move up to the 75. I am currently on week 2 of the 37.5mg. After only a couple of days I noticed jaw clenching_ sharp electric pains in my eyes_ constipation_ problems with thermoregulation_ night sweats_ vivid dreams_ a waning libido_ and inability to achieve orgasm. My depression and anxiety are usualy pretty mild_ so these side effects are not worth what little good this medication can offer. Also_ after very recent blood tests_ we discovered that my testosterone and other hormonal levels are low/off_ which is more than likely the reason why I was having symptoms of depression_ listlessness_ and lack of interest in life. My doctor has already mentioned taking me off of Effexor and focusing on the real prob,After reading other people's comments about discontinuing the use of Effexor_ I have to say that I am a bit scared. I have enough problems without having to go through this as well. I just think that in so many cases Doctors are eager to jump the gun and tell their patients that they are depressed or anxious when there could be other problems going on that they don't even consider. If you are a guy_ even a young guy_ and suffer from mild to moderate depression_ by all means_ have your hormones/testosterone checked out. Do some research on testicular hypofunction and or hypothalamus dysfunction. It could be worth it.,M,28,2  weeks,8/23/2006Email,Effexor xr

Do as much research as you can and you will find it's not worth the risk. Some people can NEVER stop taking it - others have problems for weeks or months. The only really good thing it did for me was completely wipe out my body pain when nothing else touched it - but I DO NOT recommend it becuase now that I'm off it_ the pain is worse than it's ever been before AND I have all the other stuff too.

I wake up in the morning feeling completely fine and then within an hour my heart starts to beat faster and my stomach gets heavy. I have to force myself to eat small bites of food at a time which sometimes makes me vomit. The whole point of me taking this medication is to relieve myself of these symptoms which are put on by anxiety. I now have no reason to continue Effexor if I have to live with these symptoms on a daily bases. I never had depression_ but because I feel sick and useless all the time_ I now do.

Still_ even then_ I refused to take medication.  Finally_ when I had exhausted all hope and effort_ I 'submitted' to my therapists advice and tried Lexipro-- to no avail.  Lexipro actually made me feel worse.  Effexor was the drug that changed everything.  It evened me out.  The highs and lows I used to experience dissipated; I didn't well up with emotion at the drop of a hat; I finally felt in some sort of control over my emotional state.  When friends ask about it_ I tell them that I still experience other symptoms of depression: fatigue_ loss of interest in sex_ sometimes a lack of motivation; however_ I no longer carry the  feeling that I am worthless and useless (despite having a ph.d. and a good career) and the world would be a better place without me.  It is really like the weight of the world has been lifted off of my shoulde,M,40,20  months,7/18/2006,Effexor xr
1415, 5, Anxiety,If two or more doses were missed I would get the awful and very weird electric shocks/buzzing/tingling feeling going in my head and eyes. I had no emotional withdrawal symptoms_ though_ which was great.,Effexor XR took my panic attacks and whooped them! From the moment I started it I had no attacks. NO attacks! It was rather amazing.  I wasn't officially diagnosed with depression at the time that I started taking the Effexor but I have tendencies towards depression and it helped that also.  I felt like everything was Ok again. I was pretty calm about everyday stresses and took a crisis very well. I hated coming off of it_ because I did it cold turkey and had the crazy withdrawal symptoms_ so I won't do that again.  I've been off of it for about 2 years because I'm doing ok_ but if I need something for my anxiety again I'll definately take the Effexor.,F,35,3  years,7/17/2006,Effexor xr
1416, 3, depression,Has helped my depression_ but I feel disconnected to the world_ like I am just floating through it.  I could care less about the house_ my personal hygiene and health_ job _ kids.  I don't even care if we go out to have fun or not.  Frankly I prefer to just lay on the bed all day.  I don't sleep_ just lay there_ but that doesn't bother me-I just don't care about anything.  I aksed my doc about it_ but he said that was not a side effect.  I am going to try once again (for the millionth time) to get off.,"it did help the depression but I want to ""feel' alive again.",F,55,4  years,7/17/2006,Effexor xr

1418, 5, depression,loss of libido but due to depression i didnt have much to start with_ so it doesnt bother me at all.,I have been on and off efexor xr many times with great results. I just go off it when I feel better and take a dose here and there when i have a bad day. Initially I start by taking it everyday. I have had NO problems with this drug at all. I dont wean off it i just stop even though i have been advised to wean i just feel better and forget to take it. I found it to be great. i take 150mg a day when i am on it.,F,33, ,7/15/2006,Effexor xr
1419, 5, Social Anxiety,Use a 24-hr pharmacy_ because you DO NOT want to run out. I missed 2 doses & felt like a junkie looking for a fix in Walgreen's: my head felt like it was actually vibrating_ and I had vertigo_ nervousness_ racing thoughts_ and just a sick feeling.  During the 1st several months on Effexor_ I had many of the side effects on the product insert_ but I stuck with it because the benefits were amazing and the side effects generally went away after I moved up to the next dosage. I now take 225mg in the am and mostly just have yawning spells and symptoms that seem to be related to my hormonal cycle: sweating_ hot flashes_ increased night sweats (I've always had them)_ blemishes_ and itchy scalp with some folliculitis.,"It changed my life! Before Effexor_ I was overly self-conscious_ scrutinized and obsessed over every negative interaction_ avoided social situations and drank too much when I did go_ I couldn't objectively assess situations or even think straight because of my anxiety-driven thought processes. Effexor shut off all of that background noise and I was able to think clearly and rationally.  I was less reactive_ less sensitive to criticism and rejection_ I was able to debate an issue with someone without becoming upset and defensive or  aggressive. I felt more upbeat_ less timid_ calmer_ more outgoing_ less self-conscious_ I stopped taking things so personally_ and drank WAY less in social situations. I remember having some initial successes and thinking_ ""So_ this is how normal people feel.""  I feel like I'm more in sync with the rest of the world.   I only wish I'd gone to a psychiatrist sooner.",F,37,2  years,7/15/2006,Effexor xr
1420, 5, Depression and social anxiety.,I would become very tired each time my dosage was raised_ but that would usually resolve itself within a few days. I sweat much more than I used to_ but it's not yet to the point where I'd stop the drug. It suppresses my appetite (which is fine by me) and I had some mild headaches at first_ but they went away.,I wasted two years on Zoloft feeling just as depressed and anxious as ever_ so I was skeptical about SSRIs in general. I'm so glad I gave Effexor a chance because it's been a breakthrough for me. The constant tension in my neck and shoulders has relaxed_ I feel more confident and worry less about what people think of me_ and I'm HAPPY. I actually think about and plan for the future now_ instead of just feeling exhausted thinking about it because it meant day after day after day of feeling down.,F,27,3  months,7/14/2006,Effexor xr
1421, 3, panic attacks,At first_ was very happy. Did its job and stopped the panic attacks but the withdrawals are unbearable and can't get off. Please help!,I don't know if anyone on here knows this_ but you're not supposed to get pregnant on Effexor XR because it can cause damage to the baby. When my husband and I wanted to start trying the withdrawal symptoms have kept me from being able from getting off. I've felt wierd electrical shocks_ extreme fatigue and almost blacking out. This was at 37.5 mg_ the lowest I've been told you can go. I've tried tapering for a year! Anyone been through this and actually got off? Appreciate any comments.,F,28,3  years,7/12/2006,Effexor xr

I had a very hard time coming off the med.  I was only on it for about 5 months.,I wasn't hungry_ but gained a lot of weight.  I know I wasn't as active on the drug as off of it.

I have vivid but pleasant dreams_ am a  bit spacy at times but absolutely no sexual side effects unlike with Paxil and Prozac a big plus.  Lost 10 lbs :),I was on a combo of Prozac/Paxil 300mg for about 2 years. Although the drugs worked I had real bad side effects loss of libido_ inability to achieve orgasm_ tremors and insomnia. After an initial 30 lbs weight loss_ I started gaining weightafter 18 months. I decided to stop the drugs that lasted about 10 months then I started getting terribly depressed. So here we are again back on meds. Effexor solved the depression problem almost immediately but I am still antsy.

No initiative_ things I used to like to do aren't appealing or fun anymore. (I'm really not sure if its my life or the pill doing that_ since the side effects have been most apparent the last year or so.)It works_ thats for sure. I've been on 150 mg for the majority of the 2 years_ just upped it 50% and seeing how thats doing.I would recommend it.

I had my first experience with 'brain zaps' when I missed a dose. Scared the cr*p out of me! It was like my brain was electrocuting itself. I am now terrified of withdrawal_ but am determined to get off of it and get my health + old 'self' back! I am praying to God that I don't have permanent brain damage or impairment_ and that my creativity will return when the last of it is out of my system.

1430, 2, situational depression,On starting I experienced about every possible negative side-effect. Nausua_ dizzyness_ mood swings_ both extremes of sexual disfunction (depending upon the dose I was at). Though the med kept me from spiralling down in my depression_ it also flattened my mood to the point of total apathy.  I didn't care about anything.  My job went down hill_ I had an affair_ I ignored my kids.  Things I never did before I was on Effexor_ no matter how down I got.  I eventually got off of Effexor because of severe leg cramping that made it impossible for me to sleep.  The tapering was hell_ but I used Wellbutrin and a low dose of prozac.  Have been off effexor for a month_ but am still suffering from irregular bowel movements and headaches.  Now I am  just looking back at what a mess I made of my life while on the med.,Do not take this drug unless you are being constently monitored by family_ friends_ and a therapist.

I've been off of them for 2yrs and these problems havent gotten any better.

Throughout have suffered extreme hot flashes.,"Severe side affects I mentioned include:  feeling a sort of vertigo issue just by moving my eyes around.  nausea and faintness.  electrical shock sort of feelings from behind my eyes and through my head.  disoriented and so forth.  Hot flashes has been a major issue throughout_ starting with about 3 mos after beginning treatment.  Significant weight gain_ increased appetite and difficulty controlling urge to binge.  Currently suffering bouts of ""rage"" or irrational anger.  The slightest thing sets me off_ might be time to switch meds_ this has NEVER been an issue before.  Has worked well for me over a year_ a little afraid of the withdrawal when it's time to quit.  Anyways.  Good luck.",F,30,1  years,6/10/2006,Effexor xr

It took 9 months to get off of it_ I continued to experience after effects long after I stopped taking it completely.  I wouldn't recommend this to Anyone_ EVER! Especially if there is a chance that you like me_ might have Bipolar depression_ instead of Unipolar. Took 2 years for my thyroid to be ok again & even then weight loss was only achieved by the development of anorexia nervosa.

I tried Celexa and it made me very very sleepy right away and I couldn't stand it_ so I quit taking that. My doctor wanted me to try Effexor XR.

Doc added some sleep aids_ but they did not work too well.   6 wks or so of taking 150 @ night around 11p or so_ I now believe I have figured out why the sleep aids did not work_ and why I was so keyed up while in bed.   Effexor is designed to get you going_ and taking it that late at night_ then mixing in sleep aids_ it was a counter effect @ work.   Sleep aids wouldn't work because the Effexor has the body amped up_ while the sleep aids were trying to calm and relax.

1459, 3, Depression and anxiety,Inability to orgasm on dosages higher than 75mg a day. Slight apathy and abscent-mindedness (I make lots of typos_ etc.). I guess that's because it's an effective anti-anxiety drug for me. Apart from that_ no adverse side-effects.,Before Effexor XR_ I tried: paxil_ citalopram_ sertraline and trazadone. None of them helped much. Some made me feel worse. Effexor is the first antidepressant that has really helped. And I noticed positive effects from day one. My anxiety is much improved.  I sleep better. I get fewer tension headaches. My energy levels are back to normal. I still sometimes feel unmotivated on waking up in the morning_ but I don't want to increase the dose above 75mg because of the anorgasmia_ and the potential difficulties in eventually quitting the drug. I did try 150mg a day for a week_ but the benefits didn't increase. The main benefits for me are the reduction of anxiety and the improvement in my energy levels. I used to take Ativan for anxiety_ but that made me absent-minded. Effexor doesn't make me so absent-minded. It hasn't really lifted my mood much_ but my mood wasnt really my problem. My problem was severe debility_ brought on_ I think_ by long-term anxiety.,M,54,26  days,5/16/2006Email,Effexor xr

1461, 3, low depression,Serotonin Syndrome,I was doing fine on 150 mil. and then due to an upcoming move suggested to my doctor we raise it a bit.  He doubled it and now I find out he had me 75 mil. over the recommended dosage.  I started losing days from Vertigo_ spasms_ headaches_ confusion_ etc.  This did not happen overnight and it was more gradual - which is why I never suspected Effexor.  Another doctor and two neurologists later I finally know that I ended up with Serotonin Syndrome and suspect I could be dead by now had I not put two and two together.  The neurologists never even questioned this area.  It is important that anybody taking these types of drugs know that this possibility does exist and to watch the dosage.  It is said to be rare_ but I suspect as more and more try these drugs we will hear more about this.  My symptoms were not necessairly listed as side effects and that is what threw me.  I was on no other drug and it had to be the high dosage.  I read this site and realised it could be this and cut the do,F,47,5  years,5/12/2006Email,Effexor xr
1462, 5, Anxiety_ RSI_ Depression,First two weeks were a bit weird. During that time I had some pupil dialation_ light nausea_ sugar craving_ abnormal vision (a cross between blurriness and tracers_ but fairly light)_ significant lack of concentration_ sleepiness.I still get occasional effects like those described_ but much less severe. Also_ my ability to concentrate has totally returned_ in fact much better than in a long time. The only thing that I feel I really have to watch is the nausea. Taken without food_ or not enough food to offset it will consistantly get to me. I haven't thrown up_ but sometimes it does hit me suddenly. I try to be careful_ but sometimes it still happens. Oh yeah_ effects on sexuallity have been interesting. Though I do feel my immediate nerve sensations may require a little more coaxing to get up the mountain_ my interest_ creativity_ and responsiveness have all increased. Net effect = more fun.,Some folks have mentioned clarity in thought. After the initial adjustment_ and even somewhat during_ I must say I absolutely agree. Even more_ it's like I can see bad patterns off to the side that my brain used to fall into_ and I can just acknowledge them and pass them by. It's pretty amazing. I feed the core of my trouble is anxiety_ resulting in physical pain and muscle spasm symptoms_ as well as depression. And that is where I feel the medication is really helping. Because I'm not nervous_ everything is easier. My experience with it is that it is distinctly increasing my awareness_ but not in a self-conscious or worried way. Rather_ with a calm_ confident optimism that I can make better choices. It's facsinating_ really. I even find myself catching the chronic habit of overtensing muscles in my arms and shoulders so much faster and more frequently. I'm able to just let alot of it go and reorganize my internal energy. I took Wellbutrin previously_ and this is very different. To me,F,33,1.5  months,5/10/2006,Effexor xr

Dry mouth and of course_ a decreased ability to maintain an erection and it takes forever to orgasm and when I do_ they're like a slow dripping tap :(  I also hear ringing in my ears at night like the doorbell.  For what it's worth_  I seem to be drinking much more alcohol than I had previously.,As for the depression/anxiety_ I feel that that the med has done it's job.  I've been on them for a month at 75mg. I don't experience the lows that I did however I also don't experience the highs I had as well. The doc wants to bump up my dosage?

I may switch to another medication (or raise my dose) if the effect continues to decline.  I'm taking 75mg/day.,M,41,2  months,3/1/2006,Effexor xr
1500, 3, depression; suicidal thoughts,Cravings_ mania_ sex drive THROUGH the roof,I was trying to lose weight before.  But effexor made me crave sweets like never before.  Thus I got fat.  10 lbs or so in a month.  Not worth it.  But it did save my life.  I couldn't think suicidal thoughts because I was overtaken by sexual fantasies -every-minute-of-every-day-  Anyway...i choose physical health over emotional health.  Don't go with effexor if you're not willing to gain weight for euphoria.  Withdrawal was hell: brain-zaps_ vertigo_ nausea and inability to read without vomitting.,F,20,30  days,2/28/2006,Effexor xr
1501, 1, Irritable bowel / anxiety,Found that I didn't care about much of anything.  I started drinking veryheavily and gained around 40 pounds.  When I decided to get off of it the experience was very painfull.  I had to decrease very slowly over an extended period of time.  Then I had withdrawal symptoms for a long time after.  I am now taking Buspar and while I had some problems initially_ it seems to work well.  I have lost 15 lbs and don't drink abusively.,Wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone.  Very scary.  I would classify this as having done a lot of damage to my life.  Stay away from this drug.,M,46,3  years,2/26/2006,Effexor xr
1502, 5, panic disorder,yawning_ drowsiness_ dry mouth_ bruise more easily,After a frightening experience with Lexapro_ I went on XR. My panic attacks are gone and I was able to stop the daily use of Klonopin. I've also lost 10 lbs. in the 3 weeks I've been on it. I just don't feel compelled to eat_ sometimes even when I'm hungry. Bruising more easily_ but nothing like on Lexapro.,F,36,3  weeks,2/19/2006,Effexor xr
1503, 5, Fibromyalgia,Slight vertigo the first week of taking 37.5mg then went up to 75mg and everything was fine_ felt a little more tired_ no withdrawl side effects,Effexor took away almost all my fibro pain_ it was great!!  I went off of it to try something that might give me more energy and help me lose weight_ but the pain has come back so I will most likely be back on Effexor in the next day or so.,F,31,6  weeks,2/15/2006,Effexor xr

1506, 3, anxiety_ depression,I mainly wanted to add a comment here for those who fear getting off of Effexor_ it may not be a bad as you think_ everyone is going to have different reactions. I was on 75 mg. for about 3 years. Helped quite a bit_ but after having so much trouble not sleeping_ I decided to quit. I decided to take it slow and decrease over time. I would quit_ then have flu-like symptoms_ then_ instead of getting all bent out of shape_ I would just start on it again_ at 37.5 or 75mg per day. Did this about four times over an 8 month period and the last time was a piece of cake. Do seem to have some tingling in arm/legs occasionally yet after 4 months_ but it's bearable and occasional_ but I also take Xanax and it could be from that. It could be the same for you. Don't get discouraged_ just start back on at as low a dosage as you need to still feel half decent. Good luck,Some people need this or another drug for life and that's ok. Don't be hard on yourself if the benefits outweigh the side effects. Wish none of us had to take anything ever_ but that's life sometimes. leave the NOSPAM out of my email address_ if you need to write.,M,54,3  years,2/13/2006Email,Effexor xr
1507, 1, Post Pardum,Night sweats_ nausea_ dizziness_ non-existant sex drive_ brain zaps_ headaches_ scary dreams_ anxiety_ HORRIBLE withdrawl!!,"I began taking Effexor because I suffered from horrible post pardum. I didn't want to take it but I gave in because my post pardum symptoms were miserable. Looking back I wish I had gone with my instict and flushed it down the toilet. I had horrible dreams and would wake up scared and crying. These dreams were like none that I had ever had before. If I missed only ONE pill_ (75mg once/day) I was easily irritated and would get angry very easy. I would also feel the brain zaps if I missed a dose. The withdrawl was the worst!! I tried to come off slowly but I guess it was not slow enough. I thought I was losing my mind.  I kept wanting to take it just to make the withdrawl symptoms stop! I had a lot of anxiety and strange thoughts like ""what if I drove off of this hill""!! Not that I would have done it but these things never entered my mind prior to taking Effexor. It turned me into a basket case while trying to withdrawl from it and I ended up taking Zoloft for about two months",F,32,18  months,2/6/2006,Effexor xr

1510, 5, Chronic long term depression,I started with 37.5 mg. then up to 75 then up to 150 which I have now been on for 13 months.  Starting to notice that if I am even30 minutes late taking my dose_ I start to get this whooshing sound/feeling in my brain when I move my head.  It weird and hard to describe.  Also noticing that I am drinking much more alcohol than I ever have_ yet my alcohol tolerance is unbelievable. (never was before effexor).  I am going to see my doctor as I have been experiencing the whooshing effect some mornings as soonas I wake up and I am being dilegent about taking the meds at exactly the same time every morning. Also decreased sex drive_ difficulty reaching orgasm. Dry mouth_ excessive sweating ontop of being perimenosausal.  But I was in such a black hole whenI started taking effexor that I am reluctant to switch. Effexor gave me my joy of life back. Was on prozac for a number of years.  Side effects were unbearable after year 3.  Severe tremor_ muscle pain and severe muscle weakness_cou,I am concerned about ever coming off this drug as I have had such tremendous relief from depression.  Also concerned that at 150mg I am having this brain whooshing thing as soon as I wake up that makes me feel disconnected.  What is this whooshing thing?  It kind of freaks me out and I wonder if this drug is causing permanent changes in how my brain works.,F,50,13  months,1/27/2006,Effexor xr

I went on Effexor XR and within a week felt like my old self! I highly recommend it for the RIGHT PERSON.,F,52,8  months,11/8/2005,Effexor xr
1549, 5, Depression and Anxiety,Loss of appetite. Ear ringing. Inability to sleep for more than 5 hours. Tingling in fingers and toes. Dry mouth.,This is my third cycle of Effexor XR.  The first time I went off of it I quick without tapering the dosage.  BIG mistake.  Got really irritable for about 2 weeks.  Second time I went off I tapered the dose to 37.5 mg / day.  No withdrawal symptoms.  I recently went back on it (2 weeks ago) at 75 mg / day and it's a life saver.  I was experiencing severe anxiety and depression.  Until this episode I had never had thoughts of hurting myself.  Now the thoughts are gone and I look forward to starting my day.  I've never experienced sexual side effects while taking this medicine and the initial side effects disappeared after a few weeks.  I find I can concentrate now and think clearly.  I'm not as jumpy anymore either.  I suspect I'll be taking this medicine for the rest of my life which is fine by me.,M,34,2  weeks,11/5/2005,Effexor xr
1550, 1, Severe Depression,Fine at first as it levelled out my moods and enabled me to cope with life.  From the start though I had tremors and hot sweats. Then I started to gain weight_ dizzness_ disorientation_ vivid & disturbing dreams. Excessively tired and apathetic.  When trying to reduce the dosage I experienced tinnitus_ brain shivers_ muscle spasms_ disorientation_ extreme changes in body temperature_ and agitation,While being hospitalised for depression my Doctor prescribed Effexor 250mg.  If he'd bothered to explain the potential side-eefects and the difficulties in reducing the dosage (and getting off the drug) then I probably would have had second thoughts.  It may have fixed one problem at the time but caused many others - some of which I'm still living with despite not taking the medication anymore !!!,F,32,2  years,10/31/2005,Effexor xr
1551, 4, anxiety & mild depression,Side effects - extremely vivid dreams (some good_ some bad)_ memory loss_ weight gain_ & decreased sex drive.,continued... The only way to shake some of the symptoms of withdrawl is to lay down.  It doesn't work instantly. I have to lay there awhile to feel a little better.  Once I get up the symptoms are there. The only way for me to shake these feelings it to take another dose. (I currently take 150mg.),F,26,4  years,10/30/2005,Effexor xr
1552, 3, panic attacks,Blood pressure increased a little. No other side effects that I noticed.,This medication was more effective than other medecine tried to help with constant anxiety and panic attacks. I have been on this medication for about 4 years and would like to get off but the stories I hear about withdrawal are scaring me.,M,33,4  years,10/30/2005,Effexor xr
1553, 5, Depression/Anxiety,The withdrawal effects are horrendous when I miss a dosage.  Very quick half-life_ even on the XR.  No side effects while I'm taking the medication.  Haven't noticed a decrease in libido_ aches_ pains...anything like that.  The withdrawal symptoms_ though...those are a completely different matter!,This was a miracle drug for me.  I had major suicidal thoughts with obsessive tendancies.  The week after I started taking Effexor XR_ I couldn't keep a suicidal thought in my head if I wanted to!  Miracle drug for me!  I do have some concerns about pregnancy.  I'm not pregnant yet_ but hope to become pregnant in a year or so.  Effexor XR is not an anti-depressant for pregnancy.  I don't know what I'll do then.,F,29,4.5  years,10/27/2005Email,Effexor xr
1554, 4, depression,Horrible missed dosed side effects; diffculty in orgasm,I think the medication itself_ when taken properly is fantastic.  DO NOT MISS A DOSE.  This can not be stressed more imprtantly.  When I missed two days because I was too busy to pick up the refill_ I started having SEVERE panic attacks.  Be careful.  When taken regularlly - it's great.  No decrease in sex drive - though seem to have lost ability to orgasm_ sure wish I could find it. No weight gain.,F,33,2  months,10/27/2005,Effexor xr
1555, 1, panic attacks,OMG THE WEIGHT GAIN!!!!  I gained 30 lbs on Effexor and that was enough to depress anyone...then I was on cimbalta. Cimbalta put me into a major depression after 3 months_ so now I am moving on to Wellbutin XL.  I hope this works.,I wish I hadn't had the the wieght gain with Effexor.  It had few side effects and really worked for me otherwise.,F,38,16  months,10/26/2005,Effexor xr
1556, 5, severe depression,Had a few symptoms: nausea_ agitation_ headaches when i started_ after a month they ceased,Saved me from severe depression and suicide. After 6 months felt I should stop_ very concerned after one day without efexor resulted in extreme emotions- crying etc_ electric shocks continually through my head_ nausea_ severe dizziness. Continued to work and push through with symptoms. After a week just very mild dizziness- withdrawal symptoms don't last a long time for everyone_ don't be scared to cease the meds because of withdrawal,F,30,6  months,10/25/2005,Effexor xr

ALmost shakey_ or tremors_ but they are ""below the surface"" rather than something visible.  More like I feel as though I am vibrating. Sometimes ringing in my ear_ or lightheadedness.  I was here looking for anyone who sensed the drug was moving them towards taking a higher dose (one friend suggested this might be the problem)",It did work well for my depression_ but reading these make me wonder about other things that have been going on - like the pins & needles I attributed to some other mystery.

Intermittent Crashes -- I've had small crashes after 3-6 months at which time the dose is increased.  The Wellbutrin was added to improve the effexor -- I'm not sure it did.  It seems to take about 2-3 weeks before the increased dose improves my mood.  I'm at the max. dose now -- discontinued the Wellbutrin and my psychiatrist (ADHD specialist) has added Concerta.  I'm at the starting dose of 18mg.  It has made my head more clear_ reduced my anxiety but my I'm having interupted sleep again.,F,38,3.5  years,10/18/2005Email,Effexor xr

Hyopmania at the higher dosages (150 mg).,This is the only drug--and I've tried everything but the MAOs-- that has made me feel without a doubt better.  I don't spend hours every morning questioning the purpose of my life.  The insomnia has been the worst part_ however_ and all the sleep aids I've tried (Benadry_ gabitrl_ Lunesta_ etc.) have pushed me back into a depression while_ in interacting with the Effexor_ giving me incredible and exhausting nightmares. Xanax_ though has helped me sleep_ but it has addictive potential.,M,39,10  months,10/16/2005Email,Effexor xr

Seemed to help with depression for about a year_ but I noticed that my ""lows"" were MUCH lower. My doctor bumped up my dosage a few times_ but I started getting dizzy spells a lot and these very strange ""zaps"" in my brain - like electricity going through and slowing everything down. It was very weird_ and rather disturbing when you're driving. Also_ as my dosage went up_ I was groggy ALL the time - had a lot of problems concentrating at work cause all I wanted to do was go home and take a nap.

However I felt drugged on and off theoughout the treatment...a bit like the old tricyclics.,I believe that this medication should be withdrawn. Over time it's effects tapered off and getting off it was just awful_ tapering down over a month from the normal dose still produced another month of the dreaded seratonin electric head_ headaches and sense of unreality. If I hadn't understood what was happening and why I think I would have been totally deranged.Getting off it was far harder than getting off the two tricyclics I had been on in the last 20 years and miles harder than getting off Zoloft.FWIW I would be looking for a different drug next time I need an antideppressant.,M,55,12  months,10/5/2005,Effexor xr

1599, 4, Anxiety,Very vivid dreams_ loss of appetite (had gained about 20 pounds on paxil_ so the weight loss wasn't a bad thing in my mind).  Loss of sexual interest---although I was able to achieve orgasm which was not possible on other types of drugs.,Like most drugs of this type_ you should not abrubtly stop taking it.  Within one day of a missed dosage_ the famous brain zappings_ flu like symptoms_ and disoriented feelings start.,M,41,3  years,7/18/2005,Effexor xr
1600, 3, major depressive disorder_ anxiety,dry mouth_ reduced tolerance to hot temps (not a good thing if you live in a hot climate)_ slight tremor.  If I miss a dose_ I get dizzy and have nightmares.,No sexual side effects.  I'm not sure the other side effects are worth it.  It took care of the major depression in that I can function_ but I'm still anxious and weepy_ and I'm not going to increase the dose. It's back to the doc now to see what else can be done.,F,35,7  months,7/18/2005,Effexor xr
1601, 3, depression anxiety,trouble sleeping_ inability to achieve orgasm_ severe interaction with alcohol,I've only been taking this for 13 days_ sleep trouble and lack of orgasm started immediately.  I'm hoping these side effects go away in time.  I've sworn off alcohol as I experienced severe hostility while drinking on this stuff.  I'm only taking 37.5 mg to start_ my doctor said he'd up the dosage to 75mg after 2 weeks.  I actually feel worse now than before I started taking it_ but i feel I can chalk that up to not sleeping for the last 2 weeks.  I hope to notice a beneficial difference with the dosage increase.  I'd love to converse with someone near my age (36) (female) who's going thru the same crap.  Moral support etc.,F,36,13  days,7/12/2005Email,Effexor xr
1602, 4, Panic Attacks_ Generalized Anxiety,At first_ serious sweating and then a feeling of euphoria. I think I feel more depressed somehow but also more level. Sometimes a giddy hyperness soon after I take it. Occassional leg cramps_ jumpy legs -maybe not related. Sometimes a very strange thing when I walk and I feel like an adrenaline rush and my eyes can't keep up with my walking- very hard to explain-NEVER experienced anything like it befor- but pretty rarely happens. I am at my heaviest ever and attribute about 10-15lbs. to the med.,This pretty quickly and effectively cured me of my severe anxiety_ panic attacks and especially effective for social anxiety.  I no longer get severe depression_ but sometimes feel like I am more depressed in general. STill have some occassional anxiety which is probably not normal_ but I can live with it. I am terrified about the possible difficult withdrawl but feel that I don't want to be on this drug forever.  Getting married soon and will have to get off when we plan to start our family.

1603, 5, Anxiety/Tics/ADD,Weight loss- 20lbs the first two moths. Decreased appetite. Orgasm difficulty_ Mentally I'm a little slower_ but my brain isn't going 1_000 MPH with ADD/anxiety so it's a trade off. A little tremor_ but if I lay off caffeine/alcohol it's not bad.,Don't believe the hype_ this pill isn't the devil. It killed my anxiety/ADD and I don't tic (I was blinking a lot) anymore. I love this stuff. Highly recommned it. I've also talked with 2 other people who have gone off effexor and didn't have any problems. Any pills that change the chemicals in your brain are going to be magic for some_ and hell for others. This has been magic for me. I just need to quit losing weight because I can't afford to get my clothes resized again. This won't make you fat either. I actually a forget to eat sometimes_ I never did that before. And I went from a strict low carb diet to eating whatever I want. Since I eat less on Effexor_ I still lose weight_ love this stuff.,M,,6  months,6/28/2005,Effexor xr

1609, 5, IBS caused by Anxiety/depression,It was tough to get started_ and took almost three weeks for the severe stomach pain to go away_ and then it did_ completely. It makes me sleep very deeply_ which I never did before and I've gone from being awake at 6:00a.m. to happier sleeping until 9:00a.m (in my case this is a good thing).I am also must less preoccupied with sex. I didn't think this was an issue for me at all until I found what it's probably like for normal people. I have no performance problems at all_ in fact I think my wife is enjoying our sex life more than ever before. But I am not constantly horny_ which I was. I am enjoying sex much more.I am more patient with everyone and much more able to focus on my work.The major side effect for me is that I sleep deeply.,Saved my life. I was in a downward spiral and feeling like an old man. Sad_ and in pretty much constant pain from various things. I was down to eating plain meals of only easy to digest food. I didn't go out much.Now I'm like a normal person again. Since I've been on this treatment I've come to understand that I was probably suffering from severe anxiety for the last 20 years_ with depression and physical symptoms of the anxiety setting in since I was about 40.Now I have the outlook I did when I was 25 (if not the energy). I look forward to all the things I can do in life.Effexor has turned off the background of worry that was always dripping in my head.,M,47,16  months,6/14/2005,Effexor xr

Extreme anxiety attacks lasting for 3 full days and nights - after only 3 x 75mg tablets of effexor xr,I have been on Avanza (60mg) for about 18 months_ and the doctor recently recommended adding 75mg of Efexor in the morning_ and reducing the Avanza to 30mg at night. First day (Wednesday) was fine_ second day (Thursday) i started getting anxiety attacks every couple of hours_ leading up to around lunchtime when i found myself to be extremely agitated and in a permanent state of anxiety_ the likes of which i have never experienced before - shakes_ very panicky_ extremely agitated and nervous_ etc. Friday i was in two minds about taking the pill_ but did it anyway_ and the anxiety just didn't stop. I have not taken the effexor since Friday morning_ it is now Monday and i am JUST starting to lose the anxiousness_ not to mention the feeling of total exhaustion and loss of sleep. It was that bad that i basically have hidden all weekend_ didn't answer the phone and was very apprehensive about even going downstairs to do the washing. At least i finally managed to get some sleep last night_ with the help of 2 stillnox tablets. For me this drug has been shit and i will never take it again.

REALLY KILLED MY SEX DRIVE!!! BUT I too have found a wonderful treatment for that; it is an herbal remedy by the name of yohimbe it has tripled my sexual urges yet orgasim is still harder but at least I get there! Desired weight lose almost immediately with no effort just did not want to hit the cookie jar every time i walked by it.Preety funny but sooooo true.I now have to remind myself to eat to keep up my energy. NO DOUBT THERE ARE BAD SIDE EFFECTS BUT IN MY CASE THE GOOD RESULTS OUTWEIGH THE BAD! i HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE PERSON THAT i HAD SLOWLY BEGAN TO LOSE SLOWLY DAY BY DAY ALMOST UNNOTICED AND WITH EACH DAY IT CONTINUES TO GET BETTER.I again want to live life rather than lay on the sofa and watch  the world turn between my exhausting naps and dragging off to work on rotating shiftwork.,Now I must say that not all meds are appropriatte for all people_ I had previously taken zoloft with great results but after a ten year haitus from it the second just didn't work.I too have tried paxil_ serzone_ prozac and wellbutrin BLAH! for  me.DR.S are too busy to recognize the symptoms of depression because of our crappy insurance policies or some just want you to get oveer it.  Alot of people are ashamed to say they are being treated for any kind of depression but you must remember something biological has gone awry with our brain chemicals_be it from trauma_ past medications_ post traumatic stress_ shift work(when your brain doesn't know if it should be awake or asleep) or for any number of reasons_ it is not just because you are sad_ lonely_ or lazy!!  Find a GOOD doctor_ mine had recognized my depression before I had he said he could not see the usual happy person that came to visit for thyroid problems so that day he gave me samples and dramatic changes have started to take place. Yes I have fear of long term side effects but I feel in my situation I would rather risk possible unknown side effects than to continue with the physical and emotional pain of depression.We need to be personally responsible for assessing the risk-benefit of any medications we take_ make yourself as informed as possble. Just give it a try it will not take long to decide if it is the one for you_ I must say that by the end of the first day I was ready to throw them in the trash_ incrediable anxiety_ but i forged on somehow and now I will not go without it!And for the last comment about the totally tanked sexual desire I found the yohimbe bark in the stacker2 xlc pack then i went to www.drugdigest.org and looked it up under herbs and guess what they used before viagra yep yohimbe and for me_ a female_ it has made me CRAZY FOR SEX WITH MY HUSBAND SO HE IS LOVING IT!!!  pLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU DECIDE TO TRY IT BECAUSE EVEN HERBS CAN HAVE SIDE EFFECTS BUT LOOK AT THE POPULATION OF CHINA_ THEY MUST REALLY KNOW THEIR HERBAL REMEDIES.mAKE YOUR DECISIONS WITH CARE BECAUSE WHAT IS GOOD FOR MY BODY MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR YOURS.  One last thing I also take Provigil 200 mg a day and and .5mg of ativan to eaase me off to sleep but I seem to be able to accomplish the big tasks at home and at work but my concentration on small menial tasks has gone to space somewhere gotta get that back so i can get the bills paid and finish reading my novel not to mention be able to sit still through a 30 minute sit-com.HA!HA!

Am definitely having difficulty sleeping but was able to wean off Xanax. Trying Neurontin for sleep now. Think the diagnosis of cancer plus going off my progesterone threw me into depression again.

Nausea in the beginning_ passed_ little if any weight gain_ insomnia in the beginning_ but the anxiety I experienced this time around almost killed me. Panic Mode FULL FORCE! I stopped it today. (March 11_ 2004),Not sure why Effexor XR didn't work for me this time around_ it always made my life fantastic_ bearable_ helped me through CBT_ and helped my social anxiety_ helped me to at least function. It helped me tremendously with depression AND anxiety a few years ago_ but this time around_ it is one antidepressant I will NEVER take again_ the heart palpitations/anxiety/speeding pulse rate scared the living daylights out of me and I have been taking Effexor XR for 3 months at 75mg a day.

The pill worked a little with my mood swings and I don't deny that it helps but I still continued to have the anxiety attacks which was a problem to begin with. The only way I could get up for school was when someone physically woke me up so I was late ALOT! I had really bad vivid dreams. If I missed a day I felt terrible_ crying_ anger_ etc. If I missed 2 days you might as well not even talk to me. I became lightheaded and almost passed out_ moods were so unstable. Couldn't have an orgasm during sex. When I got off the medicine it took 2 months to get to normal. Mood swings were terrible. My mother begged me to go back on it!

1669, 5, bipolar/severe depression,i have taken the drug ecstacy maybe 6 times in my life (went on effexor 2 yrs after last time) & taking effexor at 75mgs & up produces mock-ecstacy effects including: dilated pupils_ dry mouth_ overwhelming feeling of well being_ constant yawning/ear popping (also w/ paxil) some nausea_ light buzz of a headache_ some restlessness.  This feeling has been confirmed by only those who i know who have taken ecstacy previously in their lives; weird pharmacokinetics.  No probs with memory or orgasm_ except i just dont feel like having sex.  I never saw that as a side effect_ and it hasnt subsided_ so im fine with it; less distracted that way :),I have bipolar (dont know what type) with frequent severe depressive episodes_ general anxiety_ and adult ADD (what a fun person i am).  I bite my cuticles & the skin around my fingers until it bleeds_ my fingers are constantly red_ swollen_ bleeding_ & scarred from constant chewing/iiritation.  My doctor says that is OCD but i don't think so_ i do it when im scared or nervous but not all the time.  nonetheless_ i love this drug.  i guarantee anyone that if i had not ever been placed on this drug_ i would have committed suicide_ thats how bad it was.  Ive tried to take paxil_ buspar_ zoloft_ prozac_ even haldol at one point & geodon (the drug they gave to the creators of alice in wonderland).  Geodon and haldol_ since they are used as antipsychotics_ helped me too_ but i was in an emotional coma (literally) on them.  With effexor_ everything seems better and brighter; there's a good spin on the world.  not that i don't get sad_ but i am more rational with respect to how i feel and how i react to my feelings.  I'm able to calm myself down and justify my feelings without them getting all out of control.  I don't know how to explain it without sounding like a nutcase_ but i felt like a normal person for the first time.  it shocked me to believe that there are people out there who do not have access to these meds & have to deal with the kinds of feeling I had to deal with.  I am now able to think before i feel.  I am more able to cope with my impulses and negative thoughts.  The kinds of doors_ with respect to ability_ that this drug has opened for me are just phenomenal.  The effexor is the only thing which has helped for my fingers_ although they are not cured.  Also taking effexor for ADD_ which has helped tremendously in combination with Adderall.  Withdrawal is a bitch; i accidentally had to when i couldnt obtain a prescription.  Within 10 days of coming off of it_ i was in bed crying_ a hermit_ wouldnt leave the house_ everything just seemed so horrible; life wasnt worth living for anything.  Unfortunatley_ i could easily see someone like me committing suicide after coming off of it cold turkey.  its like hitting an emotional brick wall at 60mph. But otherwise_ its what has kept me alive.,F,23,1  years,3/8/2005Email,Effexor xr
1670, 4, ,Strong desire for junk food in the beginning_ along with insomnia for the first week_ and low appetite_ not too sleeping well (better than Wellbutrin though)_ breaking out (acne/zits)_ maybe slight weight gain.  But all in all_ most of them went away in first couple weeks except for the acne and dry_ flakey skin.  Better side effects than any other med I tried (Wellbutrin_ Paxil_ empower-herbal stuff),Helps with anxiety_ but can't say it's cured my issues/depression.  Still_ better than the others I tried.  Can't say I like being on it_ but felt like I just couldn't stand the constant bouncing from anxiety to depression and finally went back on it.  This is my second time on it_ and the first time I was on it for a year and a half.  Yup_ still got issues_ still in therapy_ still trying.  Effexor isn't a cure-all_ but I guess it's better than nothing.,F,29,2  weeks,3/8/2005Email,Effexor xr
1671, 2, anxiety,I have anxiety around my health_ so the side effects of Effexor really suck. I have had muscle pain in the large muscles of my arms; kind of a burn like after lifting weights and maxing out your muscular capacity. I've also had an unpleasant tremoring in my hands. Also some of the other SSRI side effects_ like dry mouth_ yawning_ insomnia_ etc. Fortunately the sexual side effects have been minimal. I've heard that this is a fairly miraculous drug for SOME people who are dealing with anxiety_ but I'd really caution people to be wary if your doc throws a free sample at you. I'm weaning myself off very carefully with the help of my doc and naturopath because of the possible withdrawal effects. Look drugs up on sites OTHER than those of the pharmaceutical companies so you can get a balanced view of what you're dealing with. And most important_ if you begin having side effects that freak you out_ be very careful how you quit taking this drug!  My best wishes to all of you (us) who are dealing with anxiety_ depression_ etc.,CAVEAT EMPTOR! Do your research ahead of time before you try Effexor. Ask around from a variety of sources. You may have a lot of trust in your doctor_ but it really pays to do some research on your own as well_ including websites OTHER than those of the big pharmaceutical companies.

1673, 5, Depression Disorder,Initially I felt like my jaw was rigid...strange but true.  Not much else other than that.,I was on this for 7 years and it worked great for me.  I had episodes of depression over my lifetime and finally went on this med. I started to wean off it for financial reasons recently and then was tired a lot.  Had a family history and thought that maybe I should try something else and asked to be switched to Wellbutrin after weaning off Effexor once I had insurance back.  DID NOT WORK...Misunderstood that the family member was on Wellbutrin AND Effexor. I was on Wellbutrin for 1 month and CRASHED hard.  Can't eat_ sleep or work. Have added the Effexor back as a small dose until I get to Psych Dr to get regulated.  If this works for you DO NOT GO OFF OF IT.  For me_ I misunderstood needing an increase for it not working.  I am in a living hell and waiting for the next few hours until I get to someone who knows what they are doing. Do not think that counseling is the answer.  If you have a chemcial imbalance and this works for you STICK WITH IT. I will never go off again and am just hoping I did not screw myself up and I don't respond to it it as well.  I had been depression free since I started it and can't believe I was dumb enough to try to go off of it. If this helps just one person that is thinking of going off of it_ it is worth posting.

This sounds worse than it really was but then all these side effects went away almost overnight.,This is the first anti-depressant I have taken and I felt it working the first day.  Before taking this drug I was constantly depressed_ weepy_ and did not have a will to really do anything.  I was not capable of coping with everyday life issues and could not really hide it from family_ friends_ co-workers anymore.  It was shocking to realize I had come this far with depression for it to affect every part of my life.  I started taking 37.5 mg for one week_ then took 75 mg for two months.  In that two month time my outlook changed completely for the better and I actually feel normal again.  My doctor recently increased my dose to 150 mg and I am feeling great.  It is not the kind of feeling where I feel drugged or altered.  It is just that the foggy heaviness is gone and I feel clear-headed again.  Everyone around me has noticed a change.

Couldn't have an orgasm even though I was more horny than usual.  :(   I toughed it out for another 6 days hoping things would change but they didn't.  I decided I'd rather take the pain than have the equipment not work.  I was really worried about withdrawal but had only minor symptoms( e.g. slight headache for a day or 2 ).Tightness in chest could have been a bigger problem( i.e. persistent hypertension ) but I was able to relax into it after a few days of meditation for 1-2 hours a day.I was able to sense/feel what the drug did and after coming off of it I was able replicate some of its effects with meditation.Great drug except for sexual SX.,M,33,16  days,1/30/2005,Effexor xr

Then take half of the half of 37.5mg_ so on and so forth_ until you are taking only a few little white balls inside the capsules per day.

1717, 5, Depression and Anxiety,None,I just wanted to make the point that despite both glowing and negative reviews for Effexor on this board_ they cannot tell someone what is right or not right for their brain chemistry. Finding the right antidepressant can be a tedious and discouraging process. They all have many potential side effects. This doesn't necessarily mean that the right drug does not exist. I do not want people to decide against Effexor out of fear that they will have experiences like others on this board. Someone who is new to antidepressants needs to carefully consider if the severity of their condition makes them willing to endure the process of finding the correct drug. There are many alternatives and like these drugs_ different ones work for different people. Be careful reading these reviews and make sure that you think for yourself about what you personally are willing to do to feel better.     -2nd year med student studying to be a psychiatrist,F,21,2  years,1/19/2005,Effexor xr

My initial side effects subsided after a few weeks_ and I felt like I had been given a new life.  However_ after several months_ I completely lost all sexual desire.  I fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful effort to maintain a romantic relationship.   I couldn't blame my girlfriend for wanting to leave after months and months of a sexless relationship; I had no interest whatsoever in anything sexual.  Although I was completely satisfied with Effexor's effect on my depression and anxiety_ this inability to maintain a relationship was enough to make me want to switch medication.  As soon as I had health insurance again (I had recently graduated college and hadn't yet found a job)_ I switched to Zoloft.  I have some sexual side effects still_ but they are less than when I was on Effexor.

My old physician thought if it was helping me sleep at night and keeping me calm (and being I had no major side effects) I might want to stay on it for as long as I wanted or forever.

1785, 1, depression (situational? hormonal?),For the first couple of days lots of difficult side effects_ but those eased. On my maintenance dose of 75 mg: weight gain (15 lbs in 2 months)_ difficulty achieving orgasm (never a problem before)_ unusually deep and long sleep_ weakened vision. None of these seemed overly significant.,Withdrawal effects began within 4 hours of skipping a dose. Eight hours after missing a dose_ the effects were violent: drenching sweat_ blinding headache_ motor-visual impairment_ and_ worst_ violent spasmodic vomiting--violent enough to make me bellow and pee my pants with each spasm_ ending with dry heaves_ staggering. Withdrawal symptoms subsided within an hour of taking dose. Three separate times I went through this scenario; first two times I thought it was food poisoning. Third time it was unmistakably the missed dose (I was fasting). Since that last time_ in September_ I've been weaning myself successfully on my own schedule: I open the XR capsule and take out 5 (initially) or 10 (when I felt ready) more granules each day_ stepping it down day by day. There are approximately 200 granules in a 75 mg capsule. Tomorrow should be my last day: yay! I've had virtually no withdrawal symptoms doing it this way. I'm also supporting withdrawal by taking good vitamins_ extra B vites_ extra C_ l-glutamine_ milk thistle_ sometimes Emergen-C_ and an herbal compound I've used before when physically stressed (Wellness Formula by Source Naturals).

After one year of taking Effexor_ I still get night sweats and very vivid dreams_ but it beats not being able to sleep or waking up in a panic.  Still feel like sleeping too much if given the opportunity_ but perfectly capable of operating on 8 hours sleep a night.  Some weight loss at the beginning_ but back to normal in a few months.  Have not cried in over a year_ which is a little weird - definitely deadens some emotions_ but it's worth it.,Effexor has been very successful for me.  It is wonderful to live life with less intensity - less anger_ worry_ sadness.  It's nice not to obsess over things_ and to just enjoy life as it comes.  I have less drive_ but I'm more successful at the things that I do choose to focus on.  This is a great feeling for a former perfectionist.,F,35,16  months,10/31/2004,Effexor xr

1807, 4, Recurrent depression,Wild_ life-like/real dreams; definitely CANNOT skip a dose (wicked headache and dizziness). Taking at same time is important_ but at a low dose (150mg for past 3 years)_ can manage to go about 8 hours beyond usual dosage time with little effects.  The 'broken sleep' however is frustrating...and if a dose is missed_ wow_ the dreams and pyschedelic 'views' the mind kicks out when eyes are closed are absolutely incredible_ scary_ affects you the next day_ etc.  Who needs to go to the movies?!  Perhaps this is what Hollywood could use -- keep a dream journal; you never know!  All that aside_ at a remission-type dose (150 mg or less)_ if i don't start experiencing very unusual health affects_ i intend to stay on this drug for a long while.  Mental illness (i.e. lack of serotonin) is just like any other defect the human body can have.  So_ why not?  It helps me immensely_ and the side affects are tolerable_ as long as i don't provoke them by missing a dose.

Serious_ almost constant attacks of vertigo and 'brain zaps' have kept me house-bound_ unable to drive or work_ and frequently even unable to walk unaided.  I tapered off fairly gradually from 150mg to 0mg_ but the step from 37.5mg to 0mg has been by far the most difficult to endure.  While the Effexor may have provided a limited amount of relief from the migraines for a short period (less than 6 months)_ that relief did not merit the side effects suffered_ the incredible withdrawal symptoms I'm currently experiencing_ or whatever risk there may be of long-term or even permanent damage to my central nervous system.  NOTE: every time I reported to my doctor that I felt the Effexor was not helping me or was making my health worse through its side effects_ he denied that the Effexor could be the cause of my discomfort and responded by INCREASING the dose.,F,41,3  years,10/18/2004,Effexor xr

The worst recurring issue is insomnia and a kind of restlessness/guarded feeling when I should be wanting to head for bed. But the stability Effexor gives me is invaluable. I suspect it's responsible for slowing my efforts at weightloss (but again_ the stability makes for a healthier life_ longterm). My advice is DON'T MISS ANY.

I brought her into my room for the second time only to find myself becoming aroused and then not aroused in a cycle.  After 4 or 5 times I was becoming confused_ needlesstosay so was she.  To make a long story short: I'm a bit disappointed with the drug (and my doctor whom told me there would be no sexual side effects) - very not cool.

Dry mouth_ very vivid dreams_ but the very worst was the urinary frequency which really debilatated me.,I started Effexor XR early April 2004 at 37.50 for two weeks; increased to 75 mg.  for two more weeks and was increased to 150 mg. which was when the urinary frequency began with a vengeance overnight!  I thought I had a bladder infection and was treated for such with no relief twice.  I finally went to a urologist and had two cultures done and both were clear;  he said that the Effexor was causing the problem.  My family doctor pretty much said I need to get to a specialist who can deal more with the anxiety issue so I made an appt. with a psychiatrist who was wonderful!  Prior to the visit I had already weaned myself down to 37.50 mg. and so the doctor took me off the Effexor XR that day which then began the week from HELL.  I began throwing furniture_ slamming doors_ yelling at people_ crying all the time.  THIS IS NOT ME!!!  This is day 6 off the medicine and am to begin Lamictal tomorrow.  The psychiatrist said that depression_ anxiety_ seisures_ obsessive/compulsive_ etc. all stem from the same area of the brain and that the Lamictal is actually an anti-seisure medicine that she believes will calm that part of the brain down;  hope she's right.  The bladder is not back to normal yet and if it doesn't get better I am going back to the urologist for tests to see if the medicine did some damage to my bladder.  I hate the anxiety attacks but coming off of this medicine is the worst I have felt in my entire life!!!   DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE and if you have any problems such as depression_ anxiety_ etc. don't rely on your family doctor.  If you can afford it_ or if your insurance covers this_ see someone who knows the brain and the medicines that are out there to help bring your life back in order.

I have had countless days where I will sleep for a ridiculous amount of time without waking up. When I finally do wake up I do so in a cold sweat - which is horrible. If I miss even one pill I am dizzy and have spells of shooting dizziness every 5 to ten minutes. I become confused and disoriented- forgetting where I put things that I just set down_ it is as though I am lost in some foreign world with my mind. Instinctively_ I want lay down and sleep to make the dizziness go away - ( I should mention my eyes are always very dry when this happens_ too) and then I will proceed to sleep for hours on end AGAIN. It scares me that these antidepressants are prescribed so casually - because they can alter your life dramatically. I feel as though I am addicted because when trying to go off of the drug (as prescribed) the withdrawel symptoms are so overwhelming - I turn into a true nutcase. I really urge that more medical research be done with these drugs. I know that I am a guinea pig for doctors due to the youth of this drug - but please keep in mind the lifechanging and devestating effects that these drugs can have on people.

I have actually lost a little bit of weight but am now concerned about weight gain after reading everyone else's comments!!!,Effexor did nothing for me when i was on small doses_ but since I have been at 150mg and higher_ i have definitely noticed a difference.  I do not cry as often and am more social and productive.  It has really heightened my level of daily functioning_ for which i am very grateful.  However_ I still have an occasional episode of hour-long sobbing_ suicidal thoughts_ and trembling.  But... I do not think i will change medicines because it took me a long time to even find a medicine that made a difference and i also fear the intense withdrawl symptoms of this medicine!

My eyesight is strange_ feel like I am in tunnel and everything looks like it is wiggling (don't know how else to describe it).  Don't feel safe driving with eyesight like this.  Hope it goes away soon.  My Dr. gave me this in conjunction with Lamictal (a mood stabilizer) but bipolar people aren't supposed to stay on antidepressants or we'll cycle.

1890, 5, Anxiety and Depression,The only side effects I experienced were mild insomnia and extreme shakiness for the first 3 days.,I was never one to take any kind of drugs.  I would only take aspirin as a last resort. But I have to say that taking the Effexor has made me feel so much better.  I read all the side effects and was reluctant to start it_ but knew that I needed to take something in order to function in life.  I am currently on 75 mgs per day and it has made a huge difference.  My advice to anyone considering taking the drug is don't stress out when reading the side effects.  All drugs effect people differently.  Give it a chance.  It took about 14 days for the drug to kick in.   The side effects did go away after about 4 days and when I increased my dose from 37.5 mgs to 75 mgs I didn't have any side  effects.  My Dr. prescribed xanax for me to take along with the   effexor for the first week which actually eliminated the shakiness and nervousness immediately.  I only had to take the xanax for the first three days on the Effexor.  I suggest that  if you decide to take the Effexor_ having the xanax on hand for the first few days will help.  I have not had to increase my dosage as of yet.  I'm hoping to be able to stay on the 75 mgs for as long as possible.  Reading about the withdrawals is a little scarey_ but like I said_ all people are affected differently by different drugs_ so I will cross that bridge if and when I get to it.  Effexor has made a huge difference in my life and when and if I have to come off it_ if I experience any withdrawals_ well_ so be it. It would be a small price to pay for  being able to enjoy life.,F,40,5  weeks,7/27/2004Email,Effexor xr

Everyone (including myself)has been baffled about the weight gain and now after visiting this site...problem solved!

It feels like an alien (or at times many aliens) are living in my head.  I have a loss of appetite and stomach cramps.  I feel confusion_ disorientation and light headedness for most of the day.  It is a relief to lie down at night.  It is impossible to describe to anyone who has not been through it the sheer hell of this kind of withdrawl.  I have had zero sex drive whilst being on the drug although I had a very low drive prior to going on the drug which was part of my history of depression anyway.,I have 2 children and it is my responsibilities towards them which keep me going throughout this hell.  It would be so easy to go back on the medication but I feel that this hell surely will end soon and I am willing to fight it out. Reading everyone else's responses has reassured me that these  side effects are consistent with the drug and has given me that added strength to battle through the hell.  I have to tell myself how depressed I was prior to taking it and remind myself of how much progress I have made since taking effexor-er.  Hopefully 2-3 weeks of hell is a small price to pay for the positive benefits I have had whilst being on the drug.,F,44,2  days,6/26/2004,Effexor xr
1913, 4, Major/ Clinical Depression,Effexor XRgives me really terrible dry mouth and I sometimes have these terrible pains in my chest and it feels as if i am going to have a heart attack.,Taking this SNRI has helped me function in my every day life. I had been on other SSRI's which did not help me at all. It is frustrating for me as I am 18 and have such troubles finding the norm. I was on Celexa for a couple months and I didn't improve at all. I have been diagnosed with SIB which means i cut myself when i get frustrated/depressed/angry/lonely/numb etc. The medicaton has not helped with my SIB but hopefully in time psychotherapy along with the SNRI's will help.,F,18,30  days,6/26/2004,Effexor xr

However_ did have some later more severe depressions and upped dosage and combined with Remeron for a brief period...then to XR @ 225. I had very severe Inflammatory Bowel Disease that I know_ connect with when I started on XR?? Now_ I am tapering off XR and immediately the IBD has gone into remission!!!!!!! Could I have been through 4 years of Hell with IBD unnecessarily???? Anyone else out there had anything like this. My tapering off is going well. I started taper off 3 weeks ago and will be off in one more week. Not too much trouble except for some anxiety and only a couple of night sweats incidents at front end. I do try to stay calm_ get plenty of rest (getting very tired around 3PM-but taking a nap) and eat moderately.

I am on 150 mg now of Effexor XR. I did not think that these things were caused by the medicine until reading this site. I am terrified to get off the medication now because of the withdrawal symptoms_ plus the regular fears that the depression and anxiety will return.

1923, 5, depression and anxiety,The first few days I was kind of spacey_ shakey_ and the anxiety actually increased.  Had a TREMENDOUS amount of energy.  Slight problem with insomnia.  Severe constipation. (Cured with prune juice).  Began on starter pack (37.5 mg for 7 days_ then increase to 75 mg).  Was worried about taking the 75 mg due to initial side effects_ but turns out side effects did not increase with dosage.  Side effects almost gone except for yawning_ stiffness in neck (not bothersome)_ and change in orgasm.  I can actually achieve,Effexor XR has been a miracle drug for me.  I was in a deep depression_ and had begun to entertain thoughts of suicide.  I have sustained energy now.  I can work all day_ come home_ and have the energy to play with my children.  I felt better a week into starting this drug.  I had almost stopped taking it due to the side effects after the first few days_ but am really glad I didn't.  I feel and act like I used to.  Everyone I know has commented on the change in my attitude_ performance at work_ and the return of my sense of humor.  I can focus mentally_ stress levels have dropped_ everything is better.  Except sex drive.  That went to hell in a handbasket.  But_ after I get started_ it seems to come back.  Overall_ I would definantly recommend this drug to someone in a similar spot that I was.  I have read about the horrors of withdrawl_ though_ and that scares me.  I hope someone has figured out a tolerable way to w/d from this drug by the time I need to go off of it.,F,32,30  days,6/20/2004,Effexor xr

1928, 5, Severe depression,Initially_ I had some weight loss (a positive!)_ nervousness/anxiety_ and blurred vision. Now_ the worst side effects for me are insomnia_ hot flashes_ and excessive sweating. My doctor added Remeron to help me sleep_ but it really didnt seem to do the job. We tried Trazodone instead and it workedhowever_ I developed 24/7 hyper-sexual arousal (yes_ I knowit doesnt sound like a problem_ but believe me--without going into too much detail--it can be). I found out that it was related to the Trazodone. Now_ I take Ambien and that seems to do the trick. I also had problems with daytime sleepiness and later ADD-type symptoms. We added Adderall_ which caused heart palpitations. While_ my internist and psychiatrist kept trying to add meds to quell the symptoms_ I did my own research and discovered that the sleepiness and ADD were not just because I wasnt getting enough sleep. I have sleep apnea_ which means that I dont get quality sleep if I dont use my CPAP machineand I hadnt used it in several months. Light bulb! I now use that lovely positive airflow machine every night and have no more problems with daytime sleepiness_ ADD_ and palpitations! Other side effects for me are dry mouth_ constipation_ and vivid dreams (which are kind of cool_ when you take time to decode them). If I miss one day of taking my 300mg of EffexorXR_ I suffer night sweats_ headaches_ nightmares_ and confusion.,I am very happy with EffexorXR. When I started taking antidepressants about 10 years ago_ I was prescribed Norpramin_ which was awful! I had horrible anxiety attacks. I took Prozac for a few years_ but I found that it made me feel like a zombieno emotions at all and an extremely low sex drive. I switched doctors and my internist prescribed Wellbutrin_ which didnt work for memore anxiety attacks. I finally found a great psychiatrist_ who prescribed Effexor and later EffexorXR. I take 300mg each morning. My depression has decreased_ Im able to function normally_ and I can still feel all my emotions. Sure_ I have some side effects_ but those I can live with. Not being able to get out of bed_ crying_ feeling hopeless_ etcnot so much. My psychiatrist also referred me to a fantastic psychologist. Ive seen her for almost 3 years now and feel like Ive made a lot of progress.,F,41,3.5  years,6/16/2004Email,Effexor xr
1929, 3, depression,increased appetite and weight gain_ no sex drive_ mental dullness_ lethargy_ apathy,When I took the first dose_ I felt better within 24 hours.  I started with 75mg for 2 weeks and then went to 150 mg after that.  I felt better than I had before I went the on drug but I couldn't feel anything else.  I didn't really care about anything-I was living but not alive.  I also gained weight and slept all the time so I didn't try to the lose the weight. I switched to Effexor from Lexapro which also made me very lethargic and that's why I switched.  I finally couldn't take the side effects anymore so I quit the Effexor cold turkey.  NEVER DO THIS!  For 8 days I was dizzy to the point I didn't want to drive. I was also severely nauseous all those days.  I was able to see my doctor and now I am on my second day of Prozac.  The Prozac has at least helped with the dizziness and nausea. I'm hoping this will work since this is the fourth medication I'm trying.  Before the Lexapro_ I tried Welbutrin_ which had no effect and I hated it.,F,33,8  months,6/16/2004,Effexor xr

Definitely has messed up my sex drive and I don't like that AT ALL.,I like that Effexor makes me feel normal and takes the worry away.  The second day on it_ I was really buzzed_ but that subsided.  The sweaty palms comment was due to having to speak in front of an AA group (I'm recovering) and my mind toys with me that I should be totally clean.  I have only been on it for a week and will probably stop taking it (will talk to doctor today) because my sex drive went down the tubes and during sex_ an orgasm was nowhere in sight.  As an alcoholic_ I am also very afraid of the dependency and withdrawal comments on this board.

1954, 2, depression_ SAD,Increased craving for sweets  at 37.5 dose; also constipation_ which I've never had in my life.  At 75 dose_ dry mouth_ painful muscle tension in neck and headache on that side of head_ extreme sleepiness_ physically dragged down. Dream exaggeration_ but not unpleasant.,After three weeks on 37.5 dose_ there was  some mood elevation. Then I went to 75 dose and I think mood elevation remained but I was too tired to notice. Sleeping 12-14 hours per night_ then nodding off on the bus_ on the couch. Coffee had no effect.  Pain in shoulder_ as if someone were pushing me_ resulting in headache bad enough to keep me in bed 30 hours_ dizziness at that time too. That sense of someone pushing me along from the outside was unexpected and unpleasant; I'd much prefer to feel better from the inside out. If Effexor had a personality_ I'd say it was a nasty Master Sargeant marching me along. The mood elevation came rapidly_ but the side effects more than cancel out the benefits. I'm now tapering off with 37.5 for 10 days_ at which time my supply will run out.    I hope to get Effexor XR out of my system and go back to Prozac in the future. When I took Prozac for a year 10 years ago_ a mere 5 mg dose/day gave me a great lift -- yes_ from the inside_ it seemed. I was in a fine mood_ got tons of work done_ made big decisions_ even looked better. I had minor side effects with Prozac for about three weeks_ then smooth sailing.  I'm very sensitive to all drugs_ and of course aging changes your system somewhat.  Effexor is not for me_ but I'll miss the exciting dreams.  Probably it's a good drug for those with more robust systems.,F,67,5  weeks,5/5/2004Email,Effexor xr

Other than the weight gain_ I would be happy (literally happy) to live with the other side effects and stay on this drug.

If you are the user of an anti-depressant medication yourself_ or_ if you are a family member or friend of someone who has used or is currently using anti-depressants_ your personal perspective is important in this research. I would like information concerning how and when you_ (or they)_ started using the prescribed medication_ the name and dosage_ (if known)_ and also for what illness or condition the medication was prescribed.Other important information for this research would cover side effects_ which would include_ but not be limited to_ odd or strange feelings or actions encountered during the drug's use. Additionally_ if you_ (or they)_ are now in the withdrawal stages_ (or have been in the past)_ any information on length of time_ dosage decreases_ feelings_ overall condition of health_ etc. would be beneficial to my research.If you are interested in sharing any portion or all of this information with me_ I welcome your email to:beach-lover@verizon.netI addition_ if you have any questions please feel free to drop me a line at the same address.Thanks!deb,F,50,1  years,4/6/2004Email,Effexor xr

I was going through a divorce and asked my doctor for something.  I can't believe how readily they just hand you whatever is in the cabinet...  Anyway_ my life is on track_ I have nothing to be depressed or sad about.  I also have no health insurance at the moment_ and it's pretty expensive_ so I decided to quit taking it... COLD TURKEY.  I knew there would be side effects_ and I was ready for them.  And boy did they arrive with a vengence!!!  I've been off for a little over a week_ and it's getting a little better.  The first 3 days or so_ I thought I was in the twilight zone.  Dizziness_ ringing of the ears_ irritable_ anxious_ horrible nightmares_ feelings of electrical surges in my body.  My God_ I wasn't in this bad of shape before I started taking the drug!!!  Well_ like I said_ it's getting a little better everyday.  But I feel I can say that this drug is VERY ADDICTIVE.  Some people probably do need to be on it forever_ but many do not.  Everyone needs to know the side effects of coming off of this drug when it is given to them!!

But on second later use it didn't work at 20 mg_ so tried Wellbutrin - a very very dangerous disaster for me and quickly stopped it.

Effexor XR helped me put my life back on track.  Mixing it with alcohol makes it less effective.  I had withdrawal effects the days after partying_ which included extreme tiredness_ irritability_ diahrrea_ not being able to work (I would go to work_ but was not as productive)_ depression_ and panic attacks.,I did a lot of research about the withdrawal effects and was afraid to taper off.  However_ I am tapering off effexor xr very successfully_ 37.5 per week.  I am exercising_ eating better_ not drinking alcohol_ and I am dealing with issues by facing them rather than escaping from them.  It is imperative that when tapering off of effexor xr to have a solid support system.  People who you can trust and talk to when you feel depressed and anxious.  The important thing is to taper slowly and to exercise_ eat right_ and stay away from alcohol.  You can do it.  Hang in there and taper off slowly.  It is working for me.

My neurologist thinks I have some obscure muscle/nerve disease_ my primary care physician prescribed the Effexor after I told him I thought I fractured my sternum!

I have been on this medication for almost a year now and it has not gotten better whatsoever.  The good obviously outway the bad or I wouldn't still be on it.  I'm not saying that sex wasn't a part of my life before_ but I can walk into a room of friends and have a conversation with them without freaking out.  I am not a hermit anymore.  I have a life.

Today is my first day being off it so unsure yet if I'll get any withdrawal symtoms. I tried Zoloft for 1.5 months prior to this and stopped that due to the extreme sexual side effects. Still no solution for my anxiety. I've been told by two doctors that there are no tests to check if I even have a chemical imbalance.

I question whether the initial positive response was more due to the apathy.  Sure_ most of the negative feelings were gone but I soon realized so were the positive feelings.  I really didn't care about anything.  Two warnings if you do try it.  Don't let your prescription run out.  I went without for 3 days and it was absolute hell.

AThen became very agited and angry and extremely tired..yawining frequently and have been using dexedrine successfully for 2 years for ADD.  and even that did effect  the extreme fatique and inablity to focus_ and lack of short term memory. Unable to function. Dr. took me off after 3 weeks total.. And then the nightmare really began.. more extreme sweats_ chills_ and extreme nausea and headache.. had to to to the ER at nigt where a shot of phenegren and something else ended the pain and nausea.  I was also coming off a second drug for bronchitis_and the first antibiotic had not worked..read somewhere that effexor sometimes causes respitory problems and bronchites..interesting.  I went to ER last night..they sent me home with sinusitus diagnosis..and another prescription for antibiotic biaxin and some predinzone..so tonight I am a mess again..exteme abdominal cramping and gas_ as well as continued hot flashe sweats and chills.. can 't sleep ia m sure because of prednizone.. forgot to mention that i was on a week pack. with the first antibiotic Leviquin.. All the while i was discussing my meds with my pschiatrist drug manager.  Also_ had many of the other not so commom problems such as neck pain and muscle aches.Nigtmare while awake and asleep.

'Woozy'feeling when turning head. Anger and rage with missed doses. Frequent urination and urgency.,Although I was put on this medication 4 years ago_ I didn't associate many of my problems with the medication until of late_as side effects.Now_ when I started counseling and reading more of the side effects others have_ I can see that these are related.I have experienced less depression over the 4 yrs_ but now my PTSD nightmares are returning along with others. I take 300mg QD_ along with 150mg Wellbutrin (was supposed to help the libido...didn't..just made my mouth dryer). Now I am feeling strange..like anxiety is returning in huge spurts. I think the good effects wore off a year ago. I am looking for alternatives now that I SEE the side effects. Had to get a guard for my mouth in order to save them from grinding off_ too.

2092, 4, Chronic dysthymia,Horrible constipation (almost total blockage if daily Metamucil and a lot of stool softener pills aren't taken every single day). Abolished my desire for sex - totally nonexistent libido.,Did a terrific job of relieving depression_ put me on a more even keel_ able to better handle stresses of life.  But the side effect of such severe constipation would prevent me from  considering using in the future.  I recently stopped taking it (too abruptly I've found out_ with stomach-flu symptoms_ vomiting up any and all food or water_ feeling hot then cold_ with restless legs and intense weird dreams at night_ and those 'trails' others have mentioned when moving your head or your eyes)_ but on a more positive note_ I happily discovered my libido is back!  All this time I thought it was just me_ perhaps a 'phase' I was going through_ not knowing how else to explain my total lack of desire for sex.  Needless to say_ my husband is delighted and will complain loudly if I ever mention wanting to go back on Effexor again! Want to give Wellbutrin a try (patient comments indicate it's a sex drive booster rather than a detractor!),F,53,20  months,8/15/2002,Effexor xr
2093, 4, Depression and anxiety disorder,extreme sweating_ not much emotion.,This drug helped me a lot when I first starting taking it. It has been four years.

With the help of my Dr. I want to get off this medication. I tried it before_ but it will have to be done very slowly because of the bad experience I had with withdrowal symptoms. I honestly think that all psychiatric medications are overused. I have been taking meds for the last 17 years. After a while the stop working and they give you something else to get addicted to.,F,39,4  years,7/30/2002,Effexor xr

With the new Psychiatrist who prescribed EFFEXOR XR_ I was told that I'd never had NMS and couldn't get NMS from EFFOXOR XR.
