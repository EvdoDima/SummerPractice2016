I HATE this drug_ it was developed in the 1940's to kill rats and now I take it daily. I am a 5 time half-marathon runner and certified yoga instructor_ my health and active lifestyle is very important to me so being on this drug makes every terrible side effect that much more worse. Almost every side effect mentioned I have experienced. I started at a Coumadin Clinic today and the pharmacist advised she doesn't see many side effects_ I call bull on that. I can't be the only one experiencing all these issues. My INR is all over the place I have varied from 1.7 to 4.3.

I wish I can say I'm looking forward to the day I no longer need it. That wish was crushed when my doctor said I have to take it for life. ?? I'm glad to know that there are people out there on coumadin who are experiencing the same side effects as I am. I was made to believe that this medicine has no side effects.

14, 2, PE in right lung after DVT leftcalf,I was getting headaches after taking Coumadin.,I experienced the PE one month ago and the clot seemed to go away after a week. Nonetheless I was put on a combination of heparin injections and Coumadin. Quickly got tired of having INR levels checked two to three times a week. For some reason I was having this sense that Coumadin was not something for me. So despite various doctors telling me I should be on Coumadin for 3 mos_ or 6 mos or indefinitely - I made my own personal decision to stop taking Coumadin. Will let you know how it goes_ but have started a regular cardio and weight training program_ and healthy diet with controlled calorie intake around 1500 per day. I feel good about this decision_ and time will tell if I have any future issues. But I had a strong personal resolve to stop taking Coumadin.,M,54,30  days11.5 1X D,10/31/2015,Coumadin

Since that time i have had numerous clots and due to all major leg veins now being occluded_ I wear a compression stocking on that leg and still have experienced about 5 or six ankle ulcers over the years.

22, 4, DVT,muscle/joint pain.  severe headache upon discontinuation,Diagnosed with a DVT after knee surgery.  Found a good balance pretty quickly where my INR was just above 2.0 and my dosage was 10mg on the nose.  Tested weekly and it never changed even with the occasional broccoli or leafy greens.  Had enough energy to keep (light) excercise and working out. I heard that was good to help a DVT dissolve.  Close to 3 months I felt the muscle or joint pain kicking in making it harder to lift_ so I'm glad the was when my doctor said I could get off of it.  NOTE:  There might some withdrawal effect from this med_ because I had a screaming headache the week following discontinuation (no weaning).  I've never had bad headaches or migraines and it was so bad I got a CT scan to make sure a clot didn't travel to my brain.  Came out negative_ so it must have been the med.,M,43,3  months10mg 1X D,3/2/2015Email,Coumadin

I got the original company name B/4 3 buyouts and consolidations from our daughter who does home health care.  All your doctor needs to do is call in an Rx to them and they will send a kit to him to train you on how to use it.  Their phone no. is 1-877-262-4669.  They use a finger prick to get the blood sample.  Also_ if you are a little shaky you can support your arm (I use the original box the equipment came in and have taped it closed again_ I also taped a white piece of paper over where I set the meter and guide my (with the other hand) finger to the test strip for the blood drop_ as the test is movement sensitive while it is being evaluated. I then call it in to the company and if out of limits they contact my doctor_ who then tells me to up or lower my dosage.  I also_ track everything I eat to keep other health life style concerns/problems under control I may have or want to avoid.  To better get a handle on controlling my INR/PT/% (depending on which part of the world you live) I have gone to the United States Department of Agriculture www.usda.gov website and looked up ""Home and Garden No. 76"" which has over 98 pages (35 lines per page)of foods and over 40 nutritional values for each food.

53, 3, DVT in thigh_ PE/Plumonary Embolism,Swelling knees_ back aches_ often have difficulty sleeping due to lower back pain along the muscles of the spine_ morning muscle aches from the kidneys upwards or muscle pain radiating out from between the shoulder blades_ the lower trapezius. More frequent cramping in calves_ fingernails are brittle (rip and chip more easily)_ fatigue/loss of physical endurance_ slower to heal_ sensation of blood rushing through my leg veins_ maybe some minor memory loss as well_ although it could be that I'm just getting older :),It is difficult to distinguish what might be a drug effect_ what is due to clotting_ and what is life_ but it seems to me that since going on Coumadin the circulation in my back muscles is reduced when I sleep. I get woken up after 5-7 hours from the ache_ and it only goes away with a massage or enhanced blood flow to the area from a little physical activity. Sometimes in the middle of the night I get calf cramps that I never used to get as well. Naturally I'm often more tired as I don't get the consistently unbroken sleep that I used to. The slight swelling at the back of my knees has made maintaining leg flexibility a challenge_ but not an insurmountable one. My INR still fluctuates every few months between 1.3 and 3.4. All of this is a pain to manage but not life changing. As a seasonal labourer the most disturbing symptom for me is the fatigue/steadily declining physical energy reserves_ although it may have more to do with hitting the 40s than Coumadin. Still_ I am looking at other drugs like Rivaroxaban but the long-term side effects are unknown.

56, 5, Right Leg DVT and PE of lungs,Hello_ the name is Robert and I was 43 when this happen and was 44 when I was taken off the Coumadin. I had pain in the left leg for sometime thinking I had pulled a muscle_ but about a month and half I started getting pain on my left side about mid back. two days later I was in bad shape and was coughing up blood. That day I was admitted to the hospital where I was told if I had waiting another 24 hours I wouldn't be here to write this. I'm now going on 47 and have been off Coumadin for 2 years. When I went on Coumadin it took only about a month or so where I was pain free after my 5 stay in the hospital. I did notice of the course of taking this drug that my hair growth slowed and was thinning on my head as well as my pubic area! Even now I don't have the hair that I had_ but the thinning has slowed and some has come back. However_ I'm glad to my alive and I'm glad that this drug was around even know it's been around for many decades. I hope all of you get better and move on with lif,,M,46,1  years7.5 1X D,7/2/2013Email,Coumadin
57, 4, Pulmonary embolism,Extreme fatigue (I'm exhausted all the time!) hair loss_ and the interaction with my other medications is causing me to get frequent headaches/migraines,After much trial and error to get the right dosage_ I'm now taking 7.5mg 4 days a week and 11.25mg the other 3 days each week.  I am two months into a six-month course of Coumadin and cannot wait to be off this medication.  I'm so tired of the side effects and having to watch my diet so carefully.  However_ my heart rate is slowly decreasing_ so I know that the Coumadin is doing it's job and that my body is breaking down the blood clot.,F,34,2  months7.5mg 1X D,6/21/2013Email,Coumadin
