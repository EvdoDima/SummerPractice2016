I HATE this drug_ it was developed in the 1940's to kill rats and now I take it daily. I am a 5 time half-marathon runner and certified yoga instructor_ my health and active lifestyle is very important to me so being on this drug makes every terrible side effect that much more worse. Almost every side effect mentioned I have experienced. I started at a Coumadin Clinic today and the pharmacist advised she doesn't see many side effects_ I call bull on that. I can't be the only one experiencing all these issues. My INR is all over the place I have varied from 1.7 to 4.3.

I wish I can say I'm looking forward to the day I no longer need it. That wish was crushed when my doctor said I have to take it for life. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'm glad to know that there are people out there on coumadin who are experiencing the same side effects as I am.

14, 2, PE in right lung after DVT leftcalf,I was getting headaches after taking Coumadin.,I experienced the PE one month ago and the clot seemed to go away after a week. Nonetheless I was put on a combination of heparin injections and Coumadin. Quickly got tired of having INR levels checked two to three times a week. For some reason I was having this sense that Coumadin was not something for me. So despite various doctors telling me I should be on Coumadin for 3 mos_ or 6 mos or indefinitely - I made my own personal decision to stop taking Coumadin. Will let you know how it goes_ but have started a regular cardio and weight training program_ and healthy diet with controlled calorie intake around 1500 per day. I feel good about this decision_ and time will tell if I have any future issues. But I had a strong personal resolve to stop taking Coumadin.,M,54,30  days11.5 1X D,10/31/2015,Coumadin

Since that time i have had numerous clots and due to all major leg veins now being occluded_ I wear a compression stocking on that leg and still have experienced about 5 or six ankle ulcers over the years.

22, 4, DVT,muscle/joint pain.  severe headache upon discontinuation,Diagnosed with a DVT after knee surgery.  Found a good balance pretty quickly where my INR was just above 2.0 and my dosage was 10mg on the nose.  Tested weekly and it never changed even with the occasional broccoli or leafy greens.  Had enough energy to keep (light) excercise and working out. I heard that was good to help a DVT dissolve.  Close to 3 months I felt the muscle or joint pain kicking in making it harder to lift_ so I'm glad the was when my doctor said I could get off of it.  NOTE:  There might some withdrawal effect from this med_ because I had a screaming headache the week following discontinuation (no weaning).  I've never had bad headaches or migraines and it was so bad I got a CT scan to make sure a clot didn't travel to my brain.  Came out negative_ so it must have been the med.,M,43,3  months10mg 1X D,3/2/2015Email,Coumadin

I got the original company name B/4 3 buyouts and consolidations from our daughter who does home health care.  All your doctor needs to do is call in an Rx to them and they will send a kit to him to train you on how to use it.  Their phone no. is 1-877-262-4669.  They use a finger prick to get the blood sample.  Also_ if you are a little shaky you can support your arm (I use the original box the equipment came in and have taped it closed again_ I also taped a white piece of paper over where I set the meter and guide my (with the other hand) finger to the test strip for the blood drop_ as the test is movement sensitive while it is being evaluated. I then call it in to the company and if out of limits they contact my doctor_ who then tells me to up or lower my dosage.  I also_ track everything I eat to keep other health life style concerns/problems under control I may have or want to avoid.  To better get a handle on controlling my INR/PT/% (depending on which part of the world you live) I have gone to the United States Department of Agriculture www.usda.gov website and looked up ""Home and Garden No. 76"" which has over 98 pages (35 lines per page)of foods and over 40 nutritional values for each food.

53, 3, DVT in thigh_ PE/Plumonary Embolism,Swelling knees_ back aches_ often have difficulty sleeping due to lower back pain along the muscles of the spine_ morning muscle aches from the kidneys upwards or muscle pain radiating out from between the shoulder blades_ the lower trapezius. More frequent cramping in calves_ fingernails are brittle (rip and chip more easily)_ fatigue/loss of physical endurance_ slower to heal_ sensation of blood rushing through my leg veins_ maybe some minor memory loss as well_ although it could be that I'm just getting older :),It is difficult to distinguish what might be a drug effect_ what is due to clotting_ and what is life_ but it seems to me that since going on Coumadin the circulation in my back muscles is reduced when I sleep. I get woken up after 5-7 hours from the ache_ and it only goes away with a massage or enhanced blood flow to the area from a little physical activity. Sometimes in the middle of the night I get calf cramps that I never used to get as well. Naturally I'm often more tired as I don't get the consistently unbroken sleep that I used to. The slight swelling at the back of my knees has made maintaining leg flexibility a challenge_ but not an insurmountable one. My INR still fluctuates every few months between 1.3 and 3.4. All of this is a pain to manage but not life changing. As a seasonal labourer the most disturbing symptom for me is the fatigue/steadily declining physical energy reserves_ although it may have more to do with hitting the 40s than Coumadin. Still_ I am looking at other drugs like Rivaroxaban but the long-term side effects are unknown.

I had pain in the left leg for sometime thinking I had pulled a muscle_ but about a month and half I started getting pain on my left side about mid back. two days later I was in bad shape and was coughing up blood. That day I was admitted to the hospital where I was told if I had waiting another 24 hours I wouldn't be here to write this. I'm now going on 47 and have been off Coumadin for 2 years. When I went on Coumadin it took only about a month or so where I was pain free after my 5 stay in the hospital. I did notice of the course of taking this drug that my hair growth slowed and was thinning on my head as well as my pubic area! Even now I don't have the hair that I had_ but the thinning has slowed and some has come back. However_ I'm glad to my alive and I'm glad that this drug was around even know it's been around for many decades.

I've been a little irresponsible with inr and missing dosage_ and as a result_ they're moving me to a new drug.,Personally_ I would like to think that some of the ailments being described are as a result of warfarin_ especially weight gain! Before reading this site_ I had heard that warfarin can cause water retention but I would heavily discourage you in taking diaretics as this is in part what helped make my dvt so big. Evenso_ my experience of the last 20 years is this: if you are getting headaches_ chest pain or any other non-normal events_ either see a doctor_ or remember that you have suffered a life threatening event and anxiety is a natural reaction to this. I used to wake up in cold sweats believing that I was having a PE or something. This happened for years_ even now sometimes. Just take a deep breath and relax. Take more exercise_ do something at least once a day. I play badminton at least 3 times a week and feel good for it. But I do still get anxious. It's only natural and can cause all sorts of phantom symptoms. Good luck to you all.,M,43,20  years8mg/day 1X D,7/16/2012Email,Coumadin

Having to take it for the rest of my life i would like to get on well with it!Since i lived with knackered heart valves for 12 years and always thought it was fitness related (im a tallish thin guy_ never been overweight at all) i've never really known (remembered) what 'normal' feels like. Im no longer tired after walking to town and back (talking feeling like i'd ran a few miles). So my mechanical valve is helping me and i doubt the warfarin is really affecting me as after 15 weeks i only got a migraine and felt 'weird'_ nothing really before so maybe its my other medication?.,M,24,15  weeks7.5 1X D,3/6/2012Email,Coumadin
109, 4, DVT,Probably saved my life. My experience is similiar. For the first 6 months I had a lack of energy. Mostly caused by inactivity and diet. Inactivity caused a 20 lb weight gain in 7 months. I still experience sensitivity to cold weather. I never have slept much. Though for awhile I did not have any energy. My doctor aid I had a low red blood cell count. So I started taking wheat grass juice and ounce every 2 or 3 days. My energy increased by 80% in the first week. My last blood test was normal for red blood cells 3 weeks ago. When I first started on warfarin I stopped eating vegitables_ I didn'k know which ones had vitamin K_ so now my colestral is a bit high. My doc has told me to start eating veggies or I'll be on a pill to reduce the colestral. So my current plan is to cut meat down to 5% of what I was eating and that is still alot. Increase veg intage by juicing and drinking the veggies. My doc told me today that I would be on warfarin for the rest of my life.

I was very physically active before the knee surgery and have been advised to not yet return to conditioning training/weight lifting_ etc.  Meanwhie_ because of delay to physical therapy due to clots_ I am far behind on recovery.  Knee procedure required far more than originally scheduled and the scarring is making procress difficult.  Ultimately_ I am not as active and that has impacted my physical and mental well being.

My doctor is 'conservative' and wants me to stay on Coumadin for life_ just in case I go back into an undetected afib. But_ I can detect afib happening. And_ the constant joint pain affects my normally active outdoor life style. I will argue (explain) to my doctor at my next visit that I am dropping Coumadin. My doctor and his PA neither one believes that there are any side effects to Coumadin. Just like all the doctors who denied any side effects to statins_ whereas the ample scientific literature proves otherwise.

I slowly started to gain weight as I was increasing my exercise routine.  By 7 months after my surgery_ I was at about 195 lbs.  Mainly in my waist area.  Exercising was much less rewarding than before.  I was feeling pretty weak and very light headed most of the time.  By about 11 months of being on this blood thinner_ I decided to just stop taking it.  This was a huge gut check to risk a blood clot_ but feeling the way I was_ I really didnÂ’t care.

After reading this message board I was seriously concerned about weight gain_ but I've actually lost a few pounds by really watching my food intake and getting back into the gym as soon as my doctors gave me the go ahead. Hair loss is my other big worry_ but so far I haven't noticed more loss than usual. I've always been an active dreamer_ but this med has punched my dreams into overdrive.

I am so glad that i found this website and that i am not the only one having the side effects i am having. I was thankfully in the hospital when the DVT was found in my upper right arm_ which was caused by me lying on that arm when unconscious (due to having pnemonia and a bad mix of medications) a few days prior to that day that the clot was found. I was then hooked up to a heparin drip for 7 days and then started taking Warfarin while in the hospital and had my INR taken every morning for over the week i was in the hospital and my dose of warfarin was changed according it the INR reading. When i was discharged from the hospital i had to go back to the hospital every 3 days for the first 3 weeks for my INR levels and am now going every 7 days to 10 days for my INR levels. I hope that i am not going to be on this much longer but that all depends on what my doctor tells me at my next appointment. I look forward to reading other peoples experience on Coumadin/warfarin.

You can't cheat yourself on sleep at all on this stuff.2.  Moderate exercise.  Yes_ you're tired_ and the last thing you want to do is work out.  But do something....bike_ walk_ lift weights.  It helps some with energy and water retention.3.  Drink more water than usual.  I found that I was not as thirsty as I usually am on this med.  However_ drinking more water seemed to help with the water retention (I would lose weight literally within a half hour of drinking a bunch of water!)_ dizziness_ a bit with energy_ and also with the heart pounding issue.  This med seems to mess with the water balance in your body.4.  Do what they say and go easy on the alcohol_ which increased the side effects for me.

302, 2, PE,Extreme fatigue and depression.  My INR got too high and they took me off it for a couple of days.  Today is day 3 without Coumadin and my depression is already 100% better.  My lower back hurts every day. I'm tired all the time but can't sleep through the night (even on Xanex).  My body hurts so bad sometimes that it hurts to lay down.  I feel like I'm one big bruise.,I'm 47 years old and just had PE for the first time.  They're not sure what caused it so through the process of elimination_ they decided to blame it on my Nuvaring (birth control).  This site has been so helpful.  I haven't discussed my side effects with my doctor yet but thought all these things were in my head. They want me to take it for 6 months but I'm not sure I can deal with it for that long.  They want me to be between 2 and 3 but my last 3 readings (which I go in for everyday) have been around 5.  It's crazy the way if fluctuates up and down. I'm starting to wonder if they'll ever get it stabilized.  I have only been on it for 2 weeks_ what are the side effects going to be like in a couple of month.

304, 4, Atrial fibrillation,bleeding_ fatigue_ itching_ rash,I was taking coumadin (Wafarin) for over 20 years. For the first 13 years my biggest problem was excessive bleeding if I cut myself and occasional nose bleeds. In the last 7 years I noticed dark spots appearing on my skin whenever IÂ’d bang against anything. I became more fatigued. I developed a rash. I had unbearable bouts of itching. My mental capacity diminished to the extent that my neurologist told me I am losing it. I understand I am 86 years old. Within the passed three months I was hospitalized twice for two bouts of rectal bleeding. Each time the doctors could not find the immediate cause though they did decide the risk of stroke was less then returning to the hospital for a third bout of bleeding.Since I have been off the medication I have more energy and more interest in the world around me. There is enough of a change in my demeanor for friends and family to comment. My overly thin skin is free of black and blue marks. I do not know if my itching and rash will disappear but I certainly hope so. I take one full aspirin a day and so far it has kept me from a stroke. I decided in the hospital that the risk of a stroke was more acceptable than the risk of bleeding every five weeks. I spoke to my doctor about what I believe to be CoumadinÂ’s side effects and he stated that with certainty that these are not side effects of the drug. I can state with the same certainty_ he is wrong.,M,86,21  years3 mg 1X D,5/22/2010,Coumadin

309, 4, Massive Pulmonary Embolism,Cold hands and feet_ increased appetite_ itchy toes and finger_ extreme fatigue_ dizzy spells and light-headedness occasionally,Started Warfarin 2 months ago after a massive PE. I am 29_ was very fit and active running half marathons and doing triathlons. So what caused my PE? I assume the pill I was on (Femodette). Doctors not sure though the fact I have sickle cell trait and had a mild case of thrombophlebitis 3 years ago may have been a precursor! I have since stopped my pill and not using any other form of oral contraception mainly so as to let me body rest. So_ my appetite has gone through the roof and not sure whether its the actual drug or my body simply trying to heal itself and requiring nourishment? I get cold hands and feet and have an annoying itchy rash that appeared on my toes then on my finger with swelling. I have noticed I feel more tired than normal more often and need to nap more often in the day. My warfarin clinic have been great and let me lead a normal life and they dose me around this. My INR still fluctuates often so the weekly INRs are a chore especially as I travel away from home with my job a lot. My diet was pretty healthy prior to my PE so thankfully not many restrictions though need to drink more water. I have not noticed any major mood swings yet!though I have tried to maintain a positive outlook and had support from family and friends. It may still be early days for me though this website has been helpful.

313, 1, DVT - Caused by Birth Control Pills,This is a follow up. Please see my post from 3/3/2010 for a full description of the side effects I experienced.,"I first posted on 3/3/2010 about my horrible experience with this drug. As stated I stopped immediately a month early cause I could not take it anymore. Now it's been nearly 6 weeks later and I'm thrilled to report that I have my life back! After looking into this med more_ I'm fairly convinced that it can somehow affect your thyroid. (This is just my opinion.) While I started improving immediately after stopping the med_ it was a bit slow going until I started taking a natural supplement called ""Thyroid Energy."" The kind I take is from Now Foods but I'd think any natural Thyroid booster might help. It's been great! I've lost 10 pounds so far without trying_ I have energy_ I can FOCUS and I'm no longer losing hair. My business is slowly but surely back on track. I wonder if being on a natural Thyroid booster while on the med would have off set some of the side effects. I don't know_ but it may be worth looking into for those of you still on this med and experiencing similar problems. However definitely talk to your doctor first as even natural supplements can be very potent! Best of luck to everyone on this stuff and by all means look into amino acids and supplements that might help_ then talk to your doctor FIRST to make sure he thinks it's safe for you before taking anything.",F,30,5  months10 MG 1X D,4/18/2010,Coumadin

Finally my husband called the ambulance_ as I could not go the steps myself and took me to the hospital. They found I was very anemic and gave me 3 units of blood right away_ 2 more units later. I had to swallow a camera and they saw a bleeding ulcer in my stomach. That is where I was losing the blood. All doctors repeated over and over: ""No more Coumadin"". I had to stay in the hospital 4 days until I regained 70% of my strength.

Although_ I am not sure if the hair loss was due to the Coumadin or stress of the experience as I am still losing hair.,I was diagnosed with a DVT on 9/30/09 due to taking the birth control pill Loestrin 24. I was aware of the serious side effects that could be caused from taking the pill but didn't think I would experience any due to my age_ no history of family clots_ and I don't smoke. My DVT was located in my right iliac vein with extension into my inferior vena cava. Dr. told me it covered a large area. I started on Lovenox which I took for about 2 weeks then switched to Coumadin which I believe saved my life. I didn't appreciate the side effects_ but it did help. I'm still alive. My INR level fluctuated quite a bit in the beginning. I started taking 2.5 mg_ then 5 mg_ then ended up taking 7.5 mg which finally stabilized my level. I had a follow-up cat scan on 12/29/09 and the clot is completely gone which was surprising. I am no longer taking Coumadin. My hematologist told me on 12/1/09 that my clot may not be gone within 3 months_ and that I may have to be on Coumadin for 6 months or longer.

No particular side effects during the first six months.,After taking coumadin for six months my PCP prescribed an antibiotic for an upper respiratory infection. She didn't have me check my coumadin pt or inr while taking it. The interaction caused my pt to go up to 5.6 and I developed a 3x2cm cranial bleed. This time the bleed was in the occipital area in the left hemisphere. I had difficulty processing what I was seeing. Ultimately_ I couldn't read. My neurologist was quite angry at my PCP. My PCP thought that 5.6 was high_ but not enough to worry about_ but my neurologist said we should worry if it reaches any amount over 3.0. Lessen learned_ the hard way! Gotta remember those interactions! I can read and write now_ as evidenced by my post_ but it was the strangest feeling in the world.,F,55,4  years,1/7/2010Email,Coumadin

I asked if it was from the warfarin and the Dr. said not likely.Then all of the other syptoms started and I was put on all different kinds of meds to help (so they thought). The Drs where being very good about it _ we live in a small town and the Drs all discussed my condition quite often. Finally after 6 weeks I could not go on any longer_ I was losing my mind. I went to see my Dr and begged her for some other alternative to warfarin because I will never make it through the holidays. One of the Coumadin nurses sugested we switch to Coumadin from warfarin. I started the Friday after Thanksgiving and within ONE week I was back to my self again. Well 80%. The funny thing was just because the Drs never heard of someone having these problems on warfarin before_ it was like it just doesn't happen!,F,48,59  days,12/12/2009Email,Coumadin
346, 5, Heart Ablation Surgery/Arrhythmia,Bruised easily_ bleeding more when cut.,I have no idea if Coumadin kept me from having a stroke or blood clot during my heart arrhythmia and ablation surgery_ but I was taking it for prevention and it did it's job. The side effects I listed to the left seem to be a given since this drug is a blood thinner. I've experienced no other side effects.

That is when I had a mitro valve replacement.  What was suppose to be a fairly routine surgery turned into a 13 hr surgery.  Long story short_  2 open heart operations_  lungs collapsed twice_ respirator twice and I coded 3 times_  Once on the table and 2 times in room.  I have been on this rat poison for to long.  I have 2 incidents where my bladder was filling up with clots.  Energy is gone_  And everytime I ask my doctor why they cant level off my coumadin_  he says he is not sure_  I wonder sometimes if it is even worth taking.,M,31,13  years,12/8/2009Email,Coumadin

You can definitely tell when your levels need to be checked. I am considering going off coumadin for a time this year to see if symptoms come back. When I was off about 4 years prior to my clot_ I would get severe double vision out of nowhere and I would have to wait for it to pass. I went to several Doctors but none thought of clots. My Doctor now said they could have been very small clots. I was also on the ""pill"" so that may have added to it and being off of it may help not to have these episodes with clots. It would be nice not to be cold all the time. Anyone else experience this?",F,30,1.5  years,12/6/2009Email,Coumadin

My INR has never tested too high_ and only tested too low when I was first being treated. I have been treated with both brand name Warfarin and Generic. I have no other significant medical issues_ and no clotting disorders. My clots were attributed to birth control pills. Heparin injections are what stabilized my blood clots_ not Warfarin_ and Warfarin doesn't make the clots dissolve_ it only picks up where Heparin left off and keeps your blood slick enough to prevent the clots you have from getting bigger_ or from forming new ones. So no I am not satisfied that given the number of incidents of DVT/PE per year_ they haven't found a better way to treat these conditions since the discovery of this medication (which was what_ in 1930 or 40?) and that they blatantly refuse to accept that this medication does indeed have grossly uncomfortable side effects and its users are not ""crazy"". Don't kid yourself people this stuff is potent. It was accidentally discovered when farmers cattle were being found dead from consuming the plant it is derived from.

Don't give up.  I found simple sugar help alot with mental focus.  I've stumble on this after I was force to quit tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking.  So I turned to candy and caffine.  Yes_ I put on 30 -35 lbs in the last 6 mths.  Prior to all this_ I also lost 125 lb and going back to some of thing I did to lose the weight.

When I discuss my recent side effects_ they tell me they are not related to coumadin. I NEVER had headaches before taking coumadin. I have had a headach EVERY DAY since leaving the hospital. The lower back pain is enough to make me cry in agony and no amount of Tylenol helps. I can't take aleve or Ibuprophen because my INR level goal is very high (4.0) and I've already had pulmonary bleeding. I REALLY REALLY hope this isn't permanent because after just one month I can't take it. I'm glad this medicine is saving my life but the side effects are getting worse.

I dont know what to say other than_ they dont give you any true information before putting you on this medication.  I am a lifer and I am thankful everyday there is something here that can assist with me having as normal of a life as possible and being able to live a long life with my family.I just wonder why they dont have any support groups for younger people as this would be of a great help.  i am so tired of people saying it is no big deal_ it is just a little pill and you will get use to it....I COULD SCREAM!!!  i just want to be as normal as possible.  I feel more calm seeing others my age and older going through the same things.  I wish there was a group that specilizes in this mess because i just soo depressed.

Take this drug with extreme caution if you have to_ and make sure you warn family and friends of the possibility you may become quite a different person (see my side effects).Be aware your doctor will advise you that Warfarin is not responsible for your side-effects.

I fell and my leg swelled up like a baloon.  Went to the ER.  They did little and sent me home.  At four am the next morning my daughter-in-law had to rush me back to the ER as I has lost so much blood into my leg my blood pressure had dropped to 75/45. I had blood transfusions and spent 3 days in the hospital.  A couple of weeks ago I started taking resveratrol only to discover it has the same blood thinning effect as coumadin and my INR shot up to 6.8 and I got severe diarrhea.  Until I read the posts on this site I never connected my severe tiredness to the coumadin - I thought it was my heart medicine.  I read there is a new drug coming out that is much better.

I originally went in for surgery to repair my Mitral Valve and at the same time have an ablation to treat my Atrial Fibrillation. A couple of weeks later I was home only a few days before I started to have complications from the surgery and the COUMADIN! I was losing consciousness and rushed back to the hospitals I.C.U. to find out that I had blood clots in my lungs_ fluid (1.5 liters to be exact)in my chest and an I.N.R. near 12!(toxic) After a Greenfield Filter was placed in my Vena Cava to catch any more clots_ a chest tube to rid my body of the fluid_ and plenty of vitamin K_ did I begin to recover from this nightmare. Upon my discharge my Dr. adjusted my coumadin from 7.5 mg to 2.5 mg. I now go for routine blood work and I have had my Dr. call and tell me to skip a day here and there because my I.N.R. levels are higher than 3.

My doctor and hematologist say that all these things I complain about are not related to the coumadin but come on do they not listen to what people taking this medicine are saying?

364, 3, Multiple Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli,Gained 10lbs and belly fat and yes_ I am blaming the coumadin since I haven't changed my lifestyle from before I was on it. I am so tired lately because the vivid dreams I have every single night don't allow me to get quality_ restful sleep. The smallest bump or pin prick hurts much worse than it used to. I am almost always cold and am dreading the Wisconsin winter even more this year. I get numbness from time to time in my hands and feet.  Had some lower back pain when I first started but it has gone away.,My doctor said that I should eat whatever I want (green vegetables_ etc) and can drink socially and he will adjust my coumadin around my life_ NOT the other way around. I am not thrilled being on this drug but I understand the necessity of it for the time being. However_ I am going to see a hematologist to talk about long term use. If I can get off of this drug in 6 months to a year_ then that's what I would prefer to do - so I am going to get multiple opinions and weigh my options. It is not fun being told that you have to be on this drug in order keep from getting more blood clots but there are compromises that can be made so it does not affect your life anymore than it has to. If your doctor does not work with you on a compromise_ then find another doctor who will. My doctor is very focused on making sure that I am healthy and have as 'normal' of a life as I can. And if you don't already have a medic alert bracelet_ I would suggest getting one for the duration you are on this medicine. If you were in an accident and unconscious and bleeding_ it would let medical personnel know that your blood is thinned and they should be extra cautious about your chances of bleeding out. Gruesome and not fun to think about_ I know_ but it's something to keep in mind.,F,28,3  months,10/1/2009Email,Coumadin

However_ my Coumadin clinic has slowly been increasing my dose from an initial dose of 3 mg daily to 12 mg daily. I've only been on the 12 mg dose for a couple of weeks. INR is stable btwn 2-2.2. I do have some insomnia_ which was VERY bad when I also had to take injectable Arixtra as an adjunct to increase INR. My doctor prescribed Ambien and this helps. My hair is very dry but so far no major hair loss. I am starting to have oily skin and breakouts_ but I'm not sure if this is because of the Coumadin or because of being taken off of oral contraceptives b/c of clotting.

As for my Weight gain I believe this to be due to too many cheeseburgers and not necessarily the warfarin. I have days where I feel like crap_ but I put my mind towards getting off my behind and doing something constructive. Usually after I start doing something I feel better.,I am a lifer on this stuff. Have been taking it for 7 years now. I do find that I have trouble mixing words in stressful situations like giving presentations or talking to my boss...makes me feel like a retard sometimes...Oh well_ I just get over it_ life is way too short to stress especially over what other people think. I do not have any other issues really...I play bass in a rock band and do not have problems learning songs so doing what I love is not affected by this.

Two weeks later I clotted again and they repeated the procedure and put in 18 inches of stents in the artery. I am on 12.5 mg but they have trouble keeping me theraputic. One week I am at 1.5 PT/INR and the next week in the ER getting a brain CT because the INR is so high. I put up with the drug because I kind of like living.

I am barely going to make this.  I don't have nausea_ but some days feel dizzy and always_ always_ extremely tired on this crazy stuff.  I was extremely concerned when I kept hearing that there are NO side-effects to this drug.  ANY time you take a foreign substance into your body there IS a side-effect.  The fact nobody in the medical world wants to admit this or research these common persistant symptoms further is odd and disconcerting.  I have no hair loss but I've only been on Warfarin for three months and have gainded 15 pounds.

At first I was resistant and after taking 15 MG it boosted the level and then I started feeling these systems.  Nobody Listens when you tell them your having this problem because they said the drug doesn't cause these systems.  I went to emergency room a few days ago because of this and they found nothing wrong with me.  Blood was okay_ Heart okay and the CT proved the blood clot in my lungs was gone.  My doctor wants me on this for a year.  I don't know if I can take it for that long.  I thought maybe my body would get used to it.,F,38,3  months,6/24/2009,Coumadin

Unfortunately_ I will have to be on Coumadin for the rest of my life and I probably won't be able to have children because of the need for Coumadin. I've been working out (swimming 1 mile & Bike 4 miles five times weekly) for two months now and have been frustrated because_ while I feel my body changing_ I have not lost one pound.

After two years on the medication I was begging the doctor to take me off.  I could not do anything except sleep.  I had tremendous weight gain going from a size 8 to a size 14! I was switched to Lovenox shots when I began trying to have a family and there was an immediate difference.  I began losing weight without even trying_ even when I was pregnant and trying to put on more weight.  Shortly after my children were weaned I was put back on Coumadin because of the side effects of Lovenox and all of the old symptoms came back_ including the weight.  The only difference is the fatigue either it is not as severe as before or having been sleep deprived with young children my body has adjusted.,F,34,6  years,6/7/2009,Coumadin

She complained up to to this point of extreme fatigue_ loss of hair_ dry skin.  Her life had been reduced to sleeping while on coumadin,We really hope she survives.

When I first went on it after throwing small venous clots to my fingers_ the first thing I noticed was it changed my T3 lab value. My T4 was normal and my T3 climbed to 11. I'm not on cytamel and I'm not hyperthyroid. Fatique has steadily gotten worse but so have my heart valves so not sure cause. The weight gain has been very difficult to take. My weight was stable for several years. After being on coumadin for 6 years now I've gone up 20lbs and it will not budge with dieting at all. My hair fell out after back surgery 18 months ago but has all grown back in. My joints always hurt but I do think they got worse on the coumadin. I'm holding on to the hope that the new drugs in trials will be out soon and we can replace coumadin.......it has too many restrictions and side effects.,Something that struck me when I found this site was the number of people that developed clots after orthopedic surgery. I'm a nurse and we see that here too. I wonder how many patients have underlying clotting diorders or autoimmunity_ they do not know about_ before they have surgery. So many of the side effects people talk about here are what we with autoimmumity deal with everyday. Any of the Docs on here have a opinion on that?

I went to my Dr. 3 times to get them to take me off coumidin and they said it was a bad idea. I finally went to a hemotologist and that Dr. explained that keeping someone on coumadin after one episode of PE was more dangerous that the chances of having a second episode. After 5 months of agony I was finally taken off of coumadin and within 24 hours my joint pain went completely away and after one week I had already lost 10 pounds without trying. I would advise if you are having negative results with coumadin to seek out a specialist and find out the truth about this very dangerous drug.

Others may occur in some people and there may be some side effects not yet known.""A medication/poison which has been around for so many years_ this is a disgraceful admission.If anyone has an alternative to taking this drug_ please email me:penguins@internode.on.net",M,65,7  months,1/31/2009Email,Coumadin
426, 3, DVT/PE after ankle surgery,Hair loss_ fatigue_ skin rash_ headaches_ dry skin_ problems concentrating_ trouble sleeping_ cold hands and feet and sometimes very hot when it is freezing inside_ joint pain_ heavy periods and cramps_ itchy scalp with small res sores_ severe depression_ anxiety_ excessive weight gain and unable to loss even with diet and exercise_decreased sexual drive_ dry hair and changes in hair texture_ feel psace out often and forgetful_ too many things_ not sure if put them all,You have no idea how much it helped to rad the comments at the same time they scared me to death.  I suppose the medicne has helped me_ but I am not sure it is worth feeling like you are not you anymore.  At least I am no crazy and I am not alone--there's a lot of us out there trying to go by.  I wish drug companies cared and that doctors listened a bit more to their patients.  So often I felt like I was loosing my mind and even wondered if I was imagining all these things I am feeling and that no one around me seems to understand or take into account based on what the doctors say.  I can't wait to get of this medicine and claim my life back_ have a child_ be me again.  I feel for all of you that are in the same boat.  Yoga and meditation seem to help a bit_ counseling_ exercise.  Don't give up.  I am really considering getting off the medicine in a few weeks when I get tests that assure me that I no longer have clots.  Good luck!,F,32,6  months,1/30/2009Email,Coumadin

Experienced none of these problems with Lovenox over the past 6 months. I live in the mid-west and am used to cold winters_ now I can't walk my dog 1 block with out my fingers feeling frozen and in agonizing pain.

428, 3, DVT,fatigue_ excessive weight gain_ hair loss,I was prescribed warfarin sodium (coumadin) after developing a bloot clot in my leg_ attributed to being on the pill.  During the 4 months I was on it_ despite going off the pill and massively cutting down on alcohol consumption_ I GAINED 25 pounds.  After I was off the coumadin_ I had my thyroid tested_ as I do every year.  I was diagnosed with mild hypothyroidism and prescribed synthroid about two months ago.  I haven't gained any more weight_ but haven't lost any either.  I note weight gain was not listed as a warfarin side effect_ but synthroid (thyroid replacement) indicates that it is not absorbed as well when on coumadin.  Could there be a link between regular thyroid function and coumadin as well?  Seems like a lot of the coumadin side effects (weight gain_ dry skin_ fatigue_ memory/concentration problems) are also symptoms of hypothyroidism.,F,34,4  months,1/27/2009,Coumadin

Have fallen twice during my drug therapy and FREAKED OUT! Both times my ample ass saved me..once slipped coming down stairs at home_ once tripped on vacuum cleaner cord.,"I had DVT that progressed to PE's after some extended periods of travel and being immobile in bed with the Flu. Dr thinks that HRT gave me my risk factor\are calling it a ""provoked"" event.  I have been on Coumadin since March 3_ 2008. I have had 3 CATs of the chest_ 2 leg dopplers_ and maintain an INR of 2.0-2.5.I no longer eat hardly anything w/Vit K. Got a list off the internet that gives amt of Vit K in different foods.Site is Dr Gourmet. Helps me manage diet. I keep gaining weight no matter what I do. Supposed to get off Coumadin at 1 year anniversary but would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. No genetic/blood risk factors or disorders. Had symptoms for MONTHS but didn't put them all together until after the event. Am married to a Doctor and he didn't even put it all together until I couldn't breathe.

430, 1, Blood Clot in Arm,"My blood pressure dropped significantly while taking this medication. The first week I felt good without any side effects. During the second week I began feeling horrible. I was tired and felt like I had the flu. I was vomitting every morning. My blood pressure would hover between 70-90. I also had problems staying warm. Cold chills were very frequent! I told thhe doctors that this medication was what was causing these side effect listed above_ but I got the same responce over and over: ""Coumadin does not have any side effects."" My cardiologist took me off of the medication after 3 weeks because he said I was at a high risk for internal bleeding. Also_ while I was taking coumadin they could never get my levels right. I was always way too high_ yet they never altered the dosage. I have been off of it for 4 weeks now_ and I am still having trouble getting my blood pressure back to normal.",I know this medication can really help people who have blood clots_ HOWEVER do your research. Have family members do research as well because doctors are under the impression this medication does not have any side effects_ which is completely stupid! The more people you can have around that are informed as what to expect when you are taking this medication_ the better off you will be. Do not play around with this drug_ or take what your doctor says at face value. Get informed and have all the people around you informed as well.,M,78,3  weeks,1/21/2009,Coumadin

I can't do my job well because I am so tired in the afternoon.  I have a hard time listening for long periods of time.  And I need to lose weight to decrease my odds of having another DVT_ but it's extremely difficult.  Large amounts of exercise only maintain the weight and I keep decreasing my portions and meals and nothing makes a dent in the scale.  Also_ I still do not have a stable INR.  I've been taking it since last January.  I take 12.5 mg every day_ but twice a week I take 15mg.  It's very high and I'm pretty nervous.,F,38,12  months,1/21/2009Email,Coumadin

Tired (but not to the extent that I am overly bothered - I just sleep more lol).,I am taking Warfarin_ and whilst it is doing its job I will certainly put up with the 'not so good' bits.  What I can't understand is that if everyone on here have very similar symptoms_ why are the doctors saying that Warfarin doesn't have any side effects_ we can't all be wrong_ and as someone else said_ we are the people taking the medication.,F,47,10  months,1/19/2009,Coumadin

I was diagnosed with bilateral multiple PE following the use of the Nuvaring fro HRT for over a year. In the past 2 days_ I have not taken my dosage (7.5 3 days a week_ 10 mg 4 days a week) because I canÂ’t stand the way feel. I have been on it for 3 months.

It took till December for my body to accept it and my INR to remain the same_ or close to_ at each blood test. Now I can go every other week instead of every week. Yay to no more bruises on my arm! I am taking 8 to 9 mg a night. The side effects i feel were never described to me. The weight gain is unreal! I am a teacher and I am always on my feet. I excersize daily_ however I have gained at least 20 lbs. I never had more than one zit at a time and now I have severe acne.

I have to sit in front of my heater with layers of clothes_ drinking coffee and still COLD. The other troublesome side effect is low blood pressure_ which really sucks.I have other symptoms many of you mentioned_ but as I also take other meds and have other conditions_ I cannot be sure they are related to warfarin. Those would include_ tiredness_ mild weight gain_ dry skin_ some hair loss_ reduced physical endurance.,Coumadin and Lovenox saved life in 2002. I have Factor V and am told I will take it the rest of my life. I have accepted that. Staying alive is more important than the discomforts and other associated risks. I have noticed that my side effects were worse when I first started the drug. I don't know if they  have lessened or I have just gotten used to it. The only thing I can't get used to is being cold. The hypotension and anemia are not pleasant either_ but I have adapted.,F,33,6  years,1/14/2009,Coumadin

I have done what I could to alleviate or minimise the side effects_ not to mention the money that I have spent trying to ""heal"" myself :0)The side effects can be debilitating at times.

I switched to Coumadin...it seems to be different. I seem to be less spacey and more able to concentrate. Though certainly not back to my old self.

I had been on a regular workout schedule before taking coumadin. Now it is a real struggle energy wise. I also seem to gain weight by breathing. Huge water retention issue. Hands and lower legs and feet swell all the time. Diruetics don't seem to help much. Feet feel thick and wooden. I assume the coumadin has helped_ but only because they have told me so. I don't have much of a problem holding a 2.2 PT with a 5 mg daily dosage. Because of family history_ I am told I may be a lifer. I hope there is another answer.",M,51,6  months,12/6/2008,Coumadin

My target INR is 3.5_ which may explain the unpleasant side effects.  When my INR is at target range_ I do not suffer strokes_ TIAÂ’s_ or clotting near the valve_ which is a blessing.  But_ high fluctuating INRs_ do cause frequent internal bleeding episodes.  Because I work full time_ this is a major inconvenience.

Have gained all over body and looks different then the usual weight gain. this has made me very depressed.,coumadin is not working. was put on it after a massive PE in March. While on the coumadin i had another clot in June.  was told by my doctor that i will be a (lifer) as i call it.  feel as if life is in a holding pattern. things will never be same. afraid of doing certain things because of bleeding and bruising.,F,49,8  months,10/9/2008Email,Coumadin

As soon as I started the coumadin I would wake at 5am and feel terrible all day. My doctor has said that I can take sleeping tablets_ but 2 more months of this feels like a nightmare. I am healthy young woman with a business to run_ and I would rather live with the 3mm clot rather than kill myself with this treatment. I have been told there is an international protocole for this treatment_ so however big or small the clot is you get 3 months of a prison sentence.

My doctor wants me on coumadin for 6 months.  I've had difficulty staying within the INR rating of 2 to 3 even though I am very careful with my diet_ etc.  I ended up with DVT and PE due to birth control.  My doctor was trying to stop my menstrual period for 6 months to get my iron levels back up (I was so anemic the iron levels did not register on blood tests).  She had me double dosing and it caused the DVT.

Both parents died from PE before family realized they each carried an inherited blood disorder.   When I started on coumadin_ dr told me not to change my lifestyle.  Told me not to eat a lot of food with high vit K_ but to go ahead and have salads everyday if I want and the dr would adjust my coumadin to my diet.  I still play tennis 2-3 times a week (I do bruise badly if hit by a ball_ but figure that is a small price to pay to be alive)_ and eat pretty much what I want.

Since coming off it I feel like I have lost my security shield in a way because I become paranoid whenever I get a new pain which I think could be another PE. However_ I am happy to be off it. One thing I am greatly concerned about now is that I still have upper chest tightness which I notice more at night in bed_ especially when I change positions in bed. I have seen a few doctors and they think it is stress causing the tightness but I don't think so. I have had an ecg and chest x-ray also and the doctor said the results were good.

I tire very easily but that may well be due to potential lung damage from the clots.  I tend to sunburn easily too_ however I have NOT had any memory or hair loss or most of the other things others are having.  No problems sleeping however I am experiencing a few small bouts with depression lately and am going to my Dr to sort that out.  I do not think its related to the Coumadin as this is 2+ years since I started taking it.,Spent a week in the hospital with it all.  D-dimer test had a reading of over 5000 and I was told by the Dr that I was extremely lucky to be alive after I passed out.  Many die within the first 60 minutes.  I was given a 'test' drug w/ my approval to break up the clots and clear them out_ plus I had a filter installed for a couple months_ otherwise I'd have been on oxygen for a minimum of 6 months.  The Dr thinks the PE may have damaged my lungs somewhat_ thus my tiring easily.

506, 4, Clot in leg and small PE in lung.,Mainly pain in and around the greater saphenous vein where the clot occurred. Some moderate to severe chest pains at times. I had mild symptoms at the time the clot and PE were diagnosed in late 12/08. Started on Clexane and then on Coumadin for 6 months. I got the clot after an international flight of 14 + hours crammed into a middle seat in economy. While on Coumadin I have had to make several overseas trips (Business class only now!) and spent weeks in Australia_ Japan and the USA. As a result_ probably due to the diet changes_ my INR has never been steady at the 2.5 required and has ranged between 1.5 - 3.7.,Reaching a steady INR of 2.5 has not been possible. Interestingly_ I feel that most of my aches and pains have had a psychological basis. In March 08 I was experiencing leg and chest pains_ most evident at night. My doctor ordered a leg ultrasound and lung CT scan.    Both results showed no evidence of the clot or PE. My pains all but disappeared. Now_ when I notice pain in the clot area I am usually in a stressful situation. For me it seems that the side effects of Coumadin arise from the stress of associated issues and lifestyle changes caused by obsessing somewhat on the obviously dangerous nature of this drug.Additionally I have noticed some weight gain however considering my diet is more bland and less healthy now_ I am not sure I can blame the Coumadin directly.,M,50,5  months,6/5/2008,Coumadin

Again_ I don't know if it is the drug or the PE.,After an initial couple of weeks with both lovenox and coumadin_ I now have stabilized with INR around 2.5-3.0 while taking 5mg daily.  I don't really have any major complaints; I have not had to make major changes in my diet or in my alcohol use (1-2 glasses of wine daily).  The biggest change for me was having to give up my razor and use an electric one instead as a precaution.  My greatest concern is not knowing how long I have to take it.

513, 2, DVT,I have been on coumadin for almost 22 years.  I think of coumadin as both good and bad.  The good is that it has saved my life.  The bad is the side effects.   When I first went on coumadin I began having trouble sleeping_ which has still continued.  I do not have the energy I once had.  I have also felt like I have ADD while on coumadin.  To summarize:  anxiiety_ lack of energy_ sadness_ and yes at times depression.  I asked for almost twenty years if there were any side effects of coumadin_ to which my hematologist said no.  Finally_ a primary care doctor informed me that there may be links to coumadin and depression/anxiety.  He began to study this after his mother went on coumadin and he noticed the effects on her.,There is yet to be any other alternative for people with DVT.  I am 100% convinced that there are grave side effects.  (lack of energy_ sadness_ and depression/anxiety),M,38,21  years,4/28/2008Email,Coumadin

The downside of this medicine was that I was losing a lot of hair_ moreso than your average fall out.  I ended up gaining at least fifteen pounds while taking coumadin_ even though I didn't change my diet or exercise.

520, 2, DVT_PE_ genetic clot tendency,What is the benefit of this process_ reporting my side effects without opportunity to feedback and support from other folks on Coumadin?A 'side effect' for me is the lack of useful information.

She insists that are no side effects to coumadin and no alternatives for me to take. She refuses to help me access reliable information so I can consider alternatives.  So_ okay_ she doesn't want to risk malpractice by helping me make an informed choice about my body and my life and my wellbeing?  If docs can't help me figure this out_ who can?

525, 4, DVT Left Calf,I experienced many side effects initially including loss of appetite_ weight loss and I was always hot.  After a month of the medications many side effects have subsided.  After my initial weight loss_ I had some weight gain (which I don't blame on this medication).  However_ try as I might_ I have not been able to take off a single pound and wonder if the medicine has something to do with it.,Most side effects could be explained because of my condition.  After being diagnosed with a small blood clot in my leg I was put on coumadin right away and told to go on bed rest.  Prior to all this happening I was active_ doing an exercise video several times a week at home_ taking kickboxing 2 days a week and bike riding with my family.  While on bedrest_ my clot worsened and now I have total blockage.  The pain was so intense I didn't want to do anything except cry.  It hurt all the time_ but anytime my leg was vertical was particularly brutal.  To avoid using the bathroom so much_ I greatly reduced eating and drinking (also the fact that if nobody was around to serve me the pain wasn't worth it).  So I attribute my initial weight loss to that and the fact that the muscle I had built was turning to fat.  I believe that I was initially hot because it was such an ordeal for me to get around.  It was like a workout to walk into the other room.  Thank goodness for the blessing of a new,F,39,7  months,3/18/2008Email,Coumadin

Initial diagnosis was crohn's disease but a great gastroenterologist was suspicious of that and ordered the blood testing. My doctor told me that this is now happening due to age - our veins become less flexible as we become older and most likely any clots in earlier years were passed easily. I never had any problems until this happened and was surprised at the diagnosis. I have not had any clots since taking coumadin and so will continue. I'm not perfect with it_ but having a home testing kit is wonderful - no more hospital visits for testing; I just call in the results.

IÂ’m extremely resistant to the blood thinning properties of Coumadin! I started on 5mg daily plus had to self-inject Clexane twice a day. My INR was 1.1_ then 1.2 then it stuck at 1.3 for over two weeks whilst they played around with my dosage. At 10mg it inched up to 1.5_ so my GP put me on 14mg daily and I finally made it over 2. At which point I stopped the Clexane. Today I scored a 3 so IÂ’m down to 12mg. IÂ’m so glad I found this website as it would appear lots of you have been experiencing side effec,F,46,4  weeks,1/18/2008,Coumadin
547, 1, Lone Atrial Fibrillation,Fatigue_ Swelling_ Nosebleeds_ Rapid Heart Rate_ Higher Blood Pressure_ Feeling of falling_ light-headiness_ nausea,my husband was on this medication for about 3 months_ when the Dr. said there was nothing else he could take_ he decided to stop taking the medication as he felt the loss of quality of life was not worth the benefit of this medication. We eventually saw a doctor who suggested an alternative Called Sintrom_ which has all the benefits of Warfarin but is better tolerated by people who just can't take Warfarin. He has only been taking it for a short time_ but so far it seems to be doing the job without the side effects. I pray that it continues to work. The doctor who told us about this drug said a lot of doctors don't know about it_ but it has been around for a while. I would suggest you talk to your doctor and see if this is available in your area. We live in Canada_ so don't know if it is available in the US or not. Good Luck.,M,65,3  months,1/17/2008,Coumadin

My eyes are blood shot as soon as my INR reaches 2.9 or above. My hair is falling out and I'm developing a bald patch. My weight fluctuates_ but I'm not sure if that's due to the inablility to exercise. My skin bruises and heaven forbid I knick myself while shaving. I am constantly tired and I can't get to sleep at night.,While I'm grateful that there is a drug out there to help us_ I feel the same way as everyone else...Why isn't there something better?

Then I had a stroke in 2005. I decided to go back on Coumadin_ found the one and only Coumadin Clinic in a doctor's office in town.  Then I had some coronary drug-eluting stents put in.  That cardiologist put me on Plavix in addition to Coumadin and aspirin. He instructed me to keep the INR between 1.8 and 2.5.  I weigh and measure vitamin K foods_ and take 2.5mg. Coumadin daily.  Well_ the stents are still patent after almost 3 years.  And no new stroke_ yet.  Ginger potentiates warfarin unpredictably.  Amiodarone raises INR off the scale.

My hematologist states that I have to take this medicine for life.  I am giving it 12 months.  By then the clot will be gone_ and I will go back to being myself.

Now_ taking HRT post-menopausally_ I developed this clot in less than 8 months.  What I plan to do is never do HRT again_ get off of the coumadin_ be myself again_ and wish for another 53 years of clot-free life.  Being heterozygous caused me to have my daughter testesd.

Minimal hair loss_ mood changes (slightly apathetic at times)_ acne (likely from stopping birth control)_ bruising_ excess bleeding (gums and menstrual).,The first few months on Coumadin are the worst in terms of side effects.  Eventually your INR will stabilize and the side effects will become less and less.  I still have some very minor hair loss_ but the bruising and bleeding has subsided.

For people that complain about chest pain check your magnezium level_ mine was low due to decreased vit k intake. Low mag. causes muscle spasms_ which your heart is one big muscle.  Im sensitive to any adjustment done on my med._ for people that dont stay in range_ the generic has a tendency to flucuate your INR. I pay a higher copay for coumadin and my ranges are now stable. Plus the generic gave me the worst acid reflux I had ever had.  Hope some of this helps others.

I had Lovenox shots 3x/day for 10 days in the beginning too.  I'm just tired of feeling like I'm a whiner or a hypochondriac!!  I want my life back to the way it used to be.  I have 4 little boys_and they need me to be constantly on the run with them_ not saying ""sorry_ but mommy really is pooped or doesn't feel very well guys"".  I know that the warfarin is why I am alive_ and I respect and appreciate that_ but it seems to me that if ther's so many of us with these same issues_ that we could work to find/develop something else that would help MORE than it hurts.

Bleeding hasn't been too bad.,Got two DVTs in leg after minor knee surgery - attributed to surgery and birth control. I'm on a fairly low dosage - right now on 4mg and INR is high enough (2-3).

Doc says that some patients never get regulated and have to have blood drawn every week for the rest of their lives. IÂ’m praying thatÂ’s not me.

606, 1, Blood Clot in leg,My mother was placed on coumadin for 6 months after finding blood clot in leg.  She completed 5 1/2 months of the treatment before her doctor took her off the medication.  She has been off the coumadin for 1 1/2 months now_ but is still experiencing the same really bad side effects that she had while taking it_ only now they are worse.  She has burning and pain in her arms and legs (arms are the worst).  She says it feels as if someone is holding a hot iron to your skin.  Her skin has changed so drastically over the last few months that even a touch leaves a major bruise that lasts for weeks.  Her skin feels like paper and brushing against ANYTHING will tear it and it will bleed for days and will not heal.  Arms and legs also itch_ but the burning and the pain are the worst.  The pain and burning are becoming unbearable.  Has anyone else that has gone off coumadin experienced these side effects after coming off coumadin?  Also_ any recommendations on how to treat the burning and pain?,,F,78,5  months,7/21/2007Email,Coumadin

My side-effects seem to be getting better (except for the burning in the stomach).  Thankful for the medicine that has kept me alive_ but I think it has side-effects even if the doctors say it doesn't.  The psychological effects of the PE are much worse than the physical_ though_ so I wonder how much of my complaints are simply in my head.

In turn I feel fat and uncomfortable and I think this is causing me to have a very low sex drive. This is hard when you are a newly wed. I have also noticed lack of motivation_ depression and my feet ache a lot. Really weird.,Regardless of the side effects_ I feel thankful for Coumadin. I feel fortunate that there is something out there for me to take_ thats going to make me better.

611, 1, Did not take,Sorry to see so many people suffering from this dangerous drug.  Here are some alternatives but work with your doctor.  Papaya's enzymes can help dissolve clots but will affect the Coumadin dosage- you will need less (good).  Garlic is very good against bacteria and good for cardiovascular system but again makes Coumadin more effective.,Raw garlic 1-5 cloves a day or garlic oil etc.  Ginko Biloba also helps thin blood but is safe- less drugs.  Nat vit E also good- mixed tocopherols best or lots of nuts.  Ginger thins blood also and has many other good properties_ anti-dizziness_ anti bacterial_ raw form digests protein and probably clots.  Nattokinase is a good clot dissolver.  And Vit D3 - from sun or pills is very important in general- or cod liver oil- also thins blood.  See vitamindcouncil.org.  Check out James Duke PhD for herbs.  Work with your doctor for the right Coumadin dose and get off it asap.,M,52,0  days,6/29/2007Email,Coumadin

I have never experienced weight gain and actually have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 years.  On the other hand_ I have experienced enhanced side effects from taking other drugs while on Coumadin.  Zoloft made me feel drunk.  The side effects of antiepileptic drugs of Gabepentin and Lyrica (dizziness_ disorientation_ loss of balance_ and excess sleep)were magnified to such an extent that I chose not to keep taking them.

Since then I have had recurring UTI and for the past few years they are becoming morefrequent.  I am now having them at least every 3 months.  Of course this means treatment with antibiotics_pyridine and antifungus meds for yeast infections.Coumadin inhibits Vitamin K which helps the good FLORA in the intestines_vagina and urinary tract.

I have not changed my diet and eat lots of greens almost every day. The Coumadin dosage was adjusted to suit my diet. It took a while to stabilize but I have been on 5 mg/2.5 mg on alternating days for about 3 years. Maybe it helps that I execercise for at least one hour every day.,M,73,6  years,4/21/2007Email,Coumadin

638, 4, PE,A week after having a heart procedure I had a PE. Now a month later I feel better but will take coumadin for 5 more months. I broke out in a rash which the docs attribute to the taking of heparin_lovenox and coumadin all at once. Thankfully that went away. I am grateful to all the posters who commented about anxiety and wondered if it was the meds or a reaction to the stress of having the condition.That made me feel a bit more normal.Thanks:) Most of my side effects are limited to nose bleeds_ gum bleeding and easy bruising. Also I am occasionally overwhelmed with sudden fatigue.,So far my levels have stayed between 2 and 3 without adjusting a thing. After reading this board I see how fortuante I am and hope it continues.

I've been sorely mistaken. I am a competitve althete and I can't afford the weight gain. Nor do I care to change my approach to reduce my options for bruising. Frankly it ticks me off.

669, 4, DVT and PE,No real side effects from coumadin. I am a medical doctor and was just dianosed with DVT and PE. So I have some interesting insight on this issue. Maybe I can help give others some assurance.  I think  a lot of the symptoms other persons here are reporting are indirectly related to the coumadin. Weight gain is likely due to  a reduction in physical activity due to the problem for which the coumadin is being taken. Dvt and pe do cause limits in activities. It is likely your doctor has kept you out of work and advised rest. This reduction in activities without a subsequent reduction in food intake probably led to increased weight. The fatigue and lack of energy could likely be caused by the anxiety and stress and depression we all felt when given our diagnosis. One minute most of us were healthy the next we are being told we have this new condition which no doubt will change our lives either short term or forever. Headache_ body aches and a host of other symptoms can result from somatiza,I have been getting headaches and my temper is shorter than usual. I tend to think its indirectly related to the DVT and PE and more likely due to all the chemicals that are floating around in my body and not from the coumadin. Chemicals with long names. Leukotrienes_ histamines prostaglandins_ reactive substances which are helping my body heal from the PE and DVT. Just like when you have a cold. All those substances which fight the cold virus also make you feel miserable. They make your head_ your whole body hurt. Even your hairs sometimes hurt. The same thing happens with blood clots and all the substances your body makes. If you've had surgery for valves or bypass that also causes pain. Inmobility causes pain. Not being able to do the things you enjoyed causes pain. The depression of being ill causes pain. Maybe its not the coumadin. Talk to you doctor. Ask. Hope this information is of use.

I was hospitalized for a week in September 2006 and haven't had a day where I can actually say ""hey_ today I feel better.""  It's constant discomfort.  I have been getting huge headaches_ I was given a Vicodin once for the headache and I felt no relief at all.  The next time I had a headache_ I was given 2 Percasets and felt somewhat better.  I was getting my blood drawn every 4-6 hours the week I was at the hospital and now I'm getting my INR checked every Monday.  It's been 2 months and I have had my dose switched many times because the anti-coagulation service can't seem to find the right dose for me.  It has been low and it has been high.  It's been 2 months already and out of those 8 weeks I think it's only been fine maybe a week.

I had a P.E after they found clots in my left leg.  Side effects cold and bruising_ nose bleeds_ and heavy periods.  Nothing that I can't handle.,I have a rare blood disorder Proththian Gene Mute (I think it is like the V-factor) where my system does not break up clots.  They just found this out 2 years ago. I was born with it. And it did get passed on to my son even though they said it is rare to pass it on to him. They said I didn't need to get him tested but I did thank god because he has it as well.  But he is healthy and just has to be aware of it he does not have to take anything.  But needs to notify doctors before surgery or if he gets in an accident. Clots are scary I had one in my lung they didn't even know about until after the fact.  So thank god for Coumadin I will be on it the rest of my life.

Additional research on side effects is SERIOUSLY needed as the drs don't seem to believe that the drug is to blame.  Biggest complaint is the fatigue.,M,25,5  months,7/14/2006,Coumadin
721, 4, DVT right shoulder,Weight gain (10+ lbs)_ feeling cold more often than before_ hair thinning_ heavy periods/miserable cramps_ mild to severe chest pains_ more sensitive/tender to touch_ frustrated more easily_ light-headed_ heart fluttering_ and the most common side effect-bruising more easily,The doctors' best guess at what caused my DVT was having been on the birth control patch (Ortho Evra). I went on birth control for regulation and cramps; starting out on the pill_ then switching to the patch_ and right before the DVT_ had switched to the Nuva Ring (which I highly suggest as an alternative to the pill). I do not like having the cramps back and I most certaintly do not appreciate the weight gain and hair loss. Hopefully I'll only be on the coumadin for 3 months and the clot will be dissolved. If not in 3 months_ then 6 months. I won't have to be on it for life_ thank God. Thank you to those that left comments_ at least I know I'm not crazy since others have had the same side effects.,F,24,6  weeks,7/13/2006,Coumadin
722, 4, DVT in right arm,First couple of weeks experienced headaches which have since subsided.  Weight gain of 6 pounds.  Feel bloated.,When diagnosed with DVT_ doctors agreed the clot was a result of my taking birth control pills (Ortho-Tricyclen).  So I stopped taking the pill the same day I was diagnosed.  My target PT/INR is between 2.0 and 3.0; however_ I have only managed to be within the range twice.  Since I began taking the med_ I have had to get my PT/INR every week until recently when I now have gone every 2 weeks for the last two tests.  Today was 3.8; tomorrow I actually have vascular studies scheduled to determine if the clot has dissolved.  I'm crossing my fingers that the doctor decides to take me off the medicine if all is good with the vascular study as my doctor did mention at the start of the therapy that he felt I would not be a life-long coumadin patient.  Although the medicine seems to have done well with ridding me of the clot in my opinion (I no longer can see nor feel the clot in my arm)_ I must admit that the weight gain has become bothersome to me.,F,31,3  months,7/10/2006Email,Coumadin

725, 5, Have 2 artificial heart valves,Bruise very easily and bruises take longer to heal. Any cuts I get seem to take longer to heal (and also bleed lots more than before.)I notice my heart beats faster at night_ sometimes keeping me awake. Don't know if it's related to Coumadin or something else. It (heart pounding) has happened since my valve replacement surgery. Haven't noticed hair loss or weight gain. But_ I'm much more sensitive to extremes of heat and cold now.I'm taking Warfarin. 5MG 3x's/week. 3MG the rest.,I'd rather not be on this drug_ but I have no choice. I'm thankful to God I was able to get new valves to keep me alive. Taking the medicine is necessary for my artificial heart valves.It was overwhelming_ at first_ learning how certain foods could impact my blood thinning. I'm used to it now.What I really hate is having to get my blood tested every 2 weeks... and realize I'll do this until I die.,F,52,2  years,7/2/2006,Coumadin
726, 4, DVT in left calf,I've been on Coumadin since 1/2006. I had terrible side effects at first_ dibilitating migraines_ dizziness_ increased blood pressure (normally my blood pressure is low because I'm a runner) and weight gain of 15 lbs in 4 months. The dizziness subsided after a couple months and blood pressure went back to normal. Still experiencing the weight gain and daily dull headaches with an increased frequency (3+ times a week)with the migraines. I'm also cold all the time_ but was before the Coumadin.,I originally attributed the weight gain to not being able to run for a month and then being forced to start back slowly. But after dieting and getting back to my normal running routine (4-5 days a week - 45-60 minutes of running at 6.5 mph or faster) I still haven't been able to lose the weight like I normally could before being on the Coumadin and still seem to be gaining. I will be getting off the Coumadin the end of July and couldn't be happier.,F,33,6  months,6/29/2006Email,Coumadin

728, 3, DVT - arm,I was initially diagnosed with a DVT in my arm_ admitted on Heparin_ then Lovonox injections ( which made me feel 'loopy' - dizzy and confused). No side effects from Coumadin initially_ 2 months into started getting dizziness and foggyness.,Some days I'm dizzy_ some days I'm not.  The Lovonox REALLY made me dizzy. Seems that fatigue and hydration may play a role as to when I feel dizzy. Also live at high altitude. I will only be on the Coumadin another couple of weeks - as they have no explanation for why I had a clot - lots of tests_ all within normal limits.,F,45,3  months,6/27/2006Email,Coumadin

730, 1, suspected pe/clot aft hysterectomy,At first a dull headache_ joint pain and stiffness then swelling of the legs and inner thighs and heaviness in arms. Now no headache but other symptoms remain though come and go. I've had hot feet at night now for three days.  Every day it's what's it going to be today? I am also at least 15 pounds heavier than when i went into hospital (for hysterectomy) late April and I had even lost weight after surgery before being put on the Warfarin.  today i bumped myself and have a painful swollen bruise. I am only going to be on this for six months.,I see from all the posts here that there are many side effects which are not listed on that rundown you get with your pills.  I called BristolMyersSquibb 800-332 2056_ and spoke to the pharmacist. He admitted that bilateral swelling (slow)in the legs is a side effect of the drug.  This is not something any of my doctors have ever thought was a side effect. The Bristol Myer pharmacist seemed very interested in hearing what other side effects I had. This is all done anonymously.  Everyone should call and let them know what the real deal is. Obviously there are things occurring that should get documented. It's hard enough to be on this drug to also feel like a hypochondriac with your doctors. I recently went to a number of specialists (vascular_ blood) to rule out possible problems.  Some doctors may not understand that we once felt pretty good and now we're legitimately concerned that we've got a whole slew of things to deal with since being on the drug.

733, 4, artificial heart valve,Since taking Coumadin I have experienced severe headaches_ body aches and hair loss. I have gained 7kg since my operation_ but not too sure if I can attribute weight gain to Coumadin. The reality is that this drug is keeping me alive_ and even though I hate the side effects_ I have to take it until a more suitable alternative is available.,I feel that the side effects of coumadin add to the frustration felt by patients after heart surgery. Rapid weight gain_ headaches and hair loss in a short period of time does alter our perceptions of self. The new self that stares back at me in the mirror is like a stranger_ but I think I can get familiar with him over time.,M,42,8  months,6/15/2006,Coumadin

735, 3, blood clot,Losing hair in big clumps_ always cold_ tingling and achy muscles_ extreme bruising_ nosebleeds_ earbleeds_ lightheaded_ fainting_ weight gain of 15 lbs_ pain in the lungs,After the birth of my second child I had a rare complication of a blood clot near my ovary. Started taking coumadin and lovinox shots every day for three weeks. Then I got to stop the shots. The side effects of this drug are now almost worse then the blood clot. With a two year old and a 4 month old child it's hard not to be tired without the added fatigue of this medication. Also_ every time I play with my two year old and I get bumped or banged with a toy I get bruises that look like I was in a car wreck. Doctors told me that losing hair wasn't a symptom or weight gain_ but judging from the reading of other entries I now think differently. I don't know how long I'll have to be on this_ but hopfully not much longer. Three months I'll get a catscan and find out how the clot is doing. Maybe then I can stop taking this drug and start to feel like a person again.,F,25,5  months,6/6/2006,Coumadin
736, 4, Mitral stenosis,I'm only on 5mg.  So far there's been no change since on coumadin. I see my Cardio MD every 6 months.,I must be really blessed because my INRs are always great. I just try to be careful because of the bruising.  I'm a clutz_ so believe me when I say I now hold on to the rails of stair cases. Had both my feet operated on in January_ so had to go off coumadin for a week. I pretty much eat what I want. It's just that if I eating something I know has Vit K_ I only eat it once a week.  Mitral stenosis is caused from undiagnosed rheumatic fever/strep throat. As a child_ I had tonsilitis all the time_ so the MDs think that's when it might have occurred. My cardio MD is a great guy and just gave me the go-ahead for my trip to Scotland next year.  Maybe I'm wrong_ but I think a positive attitude is helpful and have taught myself (w/some success) to not stress about things over which I have absolutely no control.  I've already had 15 extra years from a near-death brain tumor removal_ so why NOT be positive!,F,58,1  years,6/5/2006Email,Coumadin
737, 4, DVT Left Leg_ Protein S & Factor V,I just recently started on Coumadin again since 2/2006... The high dosages are causing me to have gained almost 20 lbs._ massive headaches_ very tired after noon (just dragging)_ a little dizziness at times..  It is a must I have some type of blood thinner because I have two blood disorders (Protein S & Factor V Leiden).. Both are carried down from my fathers side of the family. I have three children that will have to be tested to make sure they do not carry the disorders as well.  But there's not doubt the medicine will take care of the Coagulation problem but I feel it has caused the weight gain for sure..,In 1995 had a DVT in my left leg from my Hip to my ankle (almost killed me) Took Coumadin for 6 mo. then took two Heparin Shots a day in my stomach_ then years later took one shot a day of Lovenox.

Is regular blood tests necessary to adjust for medication?  I've had PT's for the first month only.  Doctor doesn't think it is necessary at this point ( into my 5th month).  I continue to have swelling in my calf and ankle areas_ especially at my sock line. Doctor also thinks that I will be able to get off it next month.

Approximately one week after starting the regimen_ I began experiencing severe headaches that rose in intensity during heavy physical/sexual exertion. I also started taking an antiarrhythmia medication at the same time as the coumadin_ and have been taking Diovan to control high blood pressure and Zocor to control chloresterol levels for several years. I have never suffered any side effects prior to beginning the coumadin and antiarrhythmia regimen.

I would much rather the doctors have warned me of these symptoms_ or at least given me affirmation when I presented them_ instead of making me feel like I'm a hypochondriac.  Knowing (or believing) that my symptoms are side-effects of the drug is so much more comforting than worrying that perhaps something yet to be diagnosed is seriously wrong.,F,27,3  months,5/16/2006Email,Coumadin
744, 4, DVT in right calf,Weight gain_ seem to sweat much more_ more sensative to extreme temperatures.,As many others have commented_ I too experience weight gain after starting coumadin(warfarin) treatment.  Part of the gain could be attributed to the fact that I could not maintain my excercise routine for several months after diagnosis.  But even after I resumed_ the weight did not come off as I expected.  If I miss any days it seems to re-appear rapidly even though I try to watch my diet carefully.  Have not experienced any hair loss or body aches / headaches as many others have stated.  My levels have been very stable_ so my dosage has been consistent (4 mg/day).  Hoping this is not a lifelong treatment.,M,43,10  months,5/15/2006,Coumadin

I am known to my doctors as one of those ""freak of nature things"" that happen to patients sometimes.  I was on birth control when this happened.  Thats it.  No injuries_ vacations_ etc.  They can't even tell me if I have to be on this for life.  Shouldn't something this serious come with some sort of an explanation????

I found I cut very easily (not so much bruising) but did not bleed excessively. I had some shortness of breath but no real problem with exercising.My main question was_ did it cause an 8-10 lb. weight gain in spite of an average of 1 to 1 1/2 hours a day of exercise (mainly biking)?If anything_ I felt like my hair has gotten a bit thicker.I'm not aware of feeling any colder than usual.,Cardioversion failed and I have gone off medication and onto 1 aspirin a day.,,62,3  months,4/25/2006Email,Coumadin

I had an INR of 10.1 recently with no medical explaination_ but they gave me vit. K and I got back to normal_ that was the only time I have had issues. I am happy b/c I had a lot of PE's and leg DVT's when I was diagnosed_ I have not had a blood clot for 5 years. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions.,F,28,5  years,4/21/2006Email,Coumadin

Feel kind of crappy all of the time but am getting used to it.,I will be on this for 6 months.  DVT is gone (verified by follow-up ultrasound).  Had flown recently which might be the cause although I have had had one Lupus Anticoagulant test come back positive (will repeat three times after Coumadin).  I am going to talk with my Doc about Dan Shen (Salvia Root) as a supplement to reduce my Coumadin amount.

Cardiologist tried cardioversion (twice) to get me back to normal. Each time it got worse and I eventually lost my heartbeat - couldn't do better than 30/minute (pretty tough walking and going up stairs). Pacemaker helps a lot. I'm taking Flecainide_ too. Don't know if that is also contributing to my cold intolerance. Looking forward to summer! Technology is wonderful - Just have to remember that it does have limits.

Without the pill the cyst grew and when I ovulated and because I was on coumadin I bled into my cyst causing extreme pain and putting me in the hospital for 1 week.

Because of my insurance I had to switch to warfarin and have not had any regulatory problems - my INR has been between 2 and 3_ and my dosage is 7.5mg M_W_F and 10 mg the rest of the week (I get checked once a month and have been on this dosage for five months).

The side effects have caused fear and extreme anxeity_ thus further worsening side effects. Now I am on an anti-depressant.,M,33,4  months,6/8/2005,Coumadin
826, 3, DVT/PE,Feeling cold but that got better with time_ to a point. Thirst or sore throat with higher doses_ 15 mg/day. Some weight gain and swelling in the face/eyes. Difficulity sleeping at higher doses. Makes you feel fuzzy or in need of coffee to stay sharp and alert but coffee doesn't help the fuzzy feeling.,No problems with bruising so far. No hair loss that I can tell. VERY difficult to regulate_ I bounce from .8 to 2.6 to 1.2 to 3.6_ it's never right. Can't take any pain medicines that actually work and tylenol is a poor pain reliever at best and really toxic to boot. I can't really think of anything good to say about Coumadin at this point in time.,M,36,5  months,6/1/2005,Coumadin
827, 3, dvt lower right leg/due to chemo,headaches_ have been her largest complaint. She has been on average dose of 7.5mg to 5 mg per day. Since Jan. 05,Just got a pt/inr home analyzer. Just looking for some other self test folks to relate to. They are telling my wife she could be on this for at least 3 more years. There is no way my wife is going to go to some clinic bi-weekly for her pt/inr for the next 3 years. I do know my wife pretty well after all she has gone thru from her battle with cancer. So we got a in home test analyzer and the Dr. is willing to let us call in the results and then he will prescibe the amount of Coumadin for the week.,F,42,5  months,5/30/2005Email,Coumadin
828, 1, dvt in left leg,tremendous weight gain...20 lbs in 5 months....annoying and disturbing since i exercise regularly (1-2 hrs 5 times a week) and i watch what i eat,i hate it...wish that doctors would explore natural alternatives to this rat poison. it's easy to push pills. also_ it has not alleviated the leg swelling. the only time i find relief is after pilates.,F,51,5  months,5/15/2005Email,Coumadin
829, 5, Aortic Valve Replacement,The only side effect that I can with confidence blame on coumadin is that I get cold much easier than before.  I'm losing my hair even though there is no evidence of balding on either side.  On the good side_ bruising isn't as bad as I expected.  I don't play with sharp things anymore.,My history is that I was very unstable.  For the first few years I was getting tested 2-3 times per week.  I've stablized at about once per week_ although I occasionally make every 2 weeks and even made it to 3 weeks one time!,M,51,14  years,4/10/2005Email,Coumadin
830, 1, seizures,dry mouth_ dizziness_ fatigue. Felt awful in general.,No joke_ this is used as rat poison. I've been through the mill (ulcer_ seizures_ kidney failure_ and transplant) and this is one of the worst drugs I've ever taken.,F,27,1  years,4/2/2005,Coumadin
831, 4, PE_ genetic clotting problems,I get cold more often (although my doc says this isn't related) mood swings and slight depression_ not sure if it's from the meds or the significance of the medication and the mortality factor.  Bruising and when I get a cut_ it takes longer to clot now.,Added worry with regard to getting pregnant; coumadin causes birth defects so it is unwise to get pregnant while taking it.  Also the necessity to watch vitamin K intake (green leafy veggies_ oils_ etc.) to maintain safe INR levels.,F,24,1  years,3/29/2005Email,Coumadin
832, 4, Blood clot therapy,,Still taking this medication for at least 2 more months,F,43,4  months,3/23/2005,Coumadin
833, 3, Stroke/Vertebral Artery Dissection,Slight light-headedness often (not major but simply annoying as I just don't feel right)_ hard focusing at times_ bloating_ loss of appetite at times_ occassional shortness of breath (although might be from me worrying).,Seems to be pretty unstable in effects. Started taking 6mg/day. Originally it was keeping me at 2.5 (Protime). Then within one week_ with no lifestyle changes_ it dropped to 1.9 and caused TIAs. Two days ago it was boosted up to 8mg/day which has brought about the mentioned side effects. Are these normal for the higher dose or will they go away. My doctor seems to be unsure of a lot of the side effects as it is such an individual reaction. (So it helped somewhat_ but still not very comfortable with it.),M,34,6  weeks,3/11/2005Email,Coumadin
834, 5, Atrial Fib,Bruise easily - even from somehting as benign as a massage.,,,,2  years,3/9/2005,Coumadin
835, 3, LUNG EMBOLISMS THROWN,IF A DRUG IS UNSTABLE AS COUMADIN IS_  THE PATRIENT BECOMES THE SAME WAY.  FEAR_ ANXIETY_ LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ALL CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS AS WELL AS THE DRUG.  EXHAUSTION IS EITHER FROM THE DRUG OR WORRY.  DRS ARE LACKING IN THEIR EXPLANATIONS. WHAT'S NEW????,TOO UNSTABLE.  NO REAL REASONS FOR THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THIS DRUG PROVIDING THAT THE PATIENT IS FOLLOWING THE RULES AS I AM.FEELS LIKE HERE TODAY_  GONE TOMORROW.,M,62,2  months,2/4/2005Email,Coumadin
836, 4, dvt/pe/ivc filter placement,hair loss_ loss of appetite and weight_ also fatigue,Although I am very comforted by the thought of all the benefits coumadin has provided me_ I am having a hard time dealing with hair loss.  It is also discouraging to me given the fact that I will remain on coumadin lifelong.  Please contact me if you have the same side effects.  Also does the hair loss continue or will my body adapt to having the coumadin in my system?,F,31,1  years,12/30/2004Email,Coumadin
837, 4, Sinus Venous Thrombosis,Tiredness_ light dizziness_ upset stomach_ lack of appetite.All of the symptoms mentioned above do not always persist but rather come and go.,If anyone else is suffering from the same side effects_ I would appreciate if you contact me via email and share that with me.,M,27,2  months,12/27/2004Email,Coumadin
838, 4, I had DVT when I was 14.,longlasting bruising.  Especially if I accidently hit my leg or arm to a chair or a table the bruise gets too dark and stays for years.  Really I am not exagerating.,,F,26,12  years,12/25/2004Email,Coumadin
839, 3, Spleenic Infarcts,A little bleeding when I brush my teeth.A bit cold_ but I live in New England_ and was borned in a very tropical city in South America_ so maybe it's not the drug that's the problem.Biggest problem with this medicine is that it constantly remains me of my mortality. Not that I though I was inmortal before. I do recomend to try to spend more time with family and friends. I feel fine_ the effect is mostly fear of getting a complication.,I still do not know why I developed the spleenic infarcts_ all my blood work came back negative. My doctor recommended life long treatment. It's hard to think about a life-time of coumidan. I'm trying to take it one day at a time. I can't complain_ had this happened to me in my country_ I would have been in big trouble.,M,32,6  months,12/12/2004,Coumadin
840, 4, Stroke,I am extremly cold now when I'm not excersising. That's the only one I can pick out though. I started it about the same time I started Neurontin (for seizures)_ so some of the initial side effects may have been confused with neurontin side effects,My blood's all normal now_ no more blood clots in my brain!,F,20,2  years,11/12/2004,Coumadin
841, 3, Aortic Valve Replacement,Where should I start? Migrane headaches_ difficulty swallowing/having to clear my throat constantly_ fatigue_ numbness of the skin on my hands/extremities_ and severe PUFFY EYES!,I take it only because I have to.

842, 3, DVT,I'm getting headaches is this normal...  and light sensitivity - blood in my nose when i blow my nose now and i bruise easily,this drug scares me b/c i'm afraid if somthing happened i wouldn't be able to clot properly,F,28,1  months,10/15/2004,Coumadin
