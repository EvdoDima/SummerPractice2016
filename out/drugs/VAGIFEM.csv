0, 1, To soften cervix prior to surgery,Vaginal bleeding just like period (not had a period for 4 years as ovaries removed) bleeding now for 5 days with no let up as yet_ headaches_ hot flushes_ emotional_ feel horrible!,If any doctor tells you to take this to soften the cervix prior to any procedure to make it more comfortable and easier DO NOT TAKE IT!! I had a polyp removed 5 days ago_ a simple and quick procedure_ never expected to have the side effects I have had. If I knew then what I know now I would never have taken it. I feel the same as I did prior to having ovaries removed due to going through a horrible menopause.

1, 1, Vaginal atrophy/heal vag wall tear,Initial stinging after insertion which subsided after an hour.Day 1-discharge on applicator.Day 2- waves of nausea and diarrhoea which subsided after a day.Day 3 drawing feeling in pelvic region and lower back pain as if starting a period.All the above subsided.Day 4- soreness in vagina and around bladder.Felt like it was on fire.Dreadful discharge so assumed thrush and took a fluconazole and gave up.Hoping all this subsides now stopping the medication.No idea whether this will help dryness/ atrophy as could not face sex with this amount of soreness and discharge going on anyway!Am worried this will give me an ongoing problem with thrush. All in all it has caused me a pretty rough four days and to no avail.Hope there are othet options available as am done for if this is the only one.Fearing for my future sex life to be honest so has increased my anxiety levels too.Can't seem to get much help from doctors or gynaecologists either@,,F,51,4  days10mg,7/22/2016,Vagifem

After the initial build up_ hoped side effects would subside. Some effects did_ but a few hours after taking the pill thereafter (4 days off_ 1 day on)_ the cramping and bloating would resume with a vengeance. Doctor told me it would be ""very unusual"" that my symptoms would be caused by vagifem and ordered vaginal ultrasound suspecting ovarian cancer! Ovaries are fine...been off meds for almost 2 weeks and FINALLY the symptoms are resolving (going off brought a lot of abdominal pain too). The medicine DID work for the intended purpose but clearly NOT worth it for me.

54, 3, Pain in urethra area,I thought I had UTI or external yeast but was in need of estrogen and opted for Vagifem. Doctor offered ring or cream estrogen but most preferred pill and doctor knew nothing about it till I informed. He read the web  information wild I was still in the office and he a wrote a prescription with instructions to take twice weekly. I am a brand new patient and per the instructions in the box I am supposed to take 10 milligrams for 2 weeks every day and then switch to the twice weekly routine. When I told this doctor he reacted as a typical doctor would found to be at fault and claims I can take this lower dose and still have the same result over time. In fact this will expose me to the estrogen side effects longer in time by stretching it results longer_  possibly never attaining results and  refuses to change his orders. Apparently there is a reason to take the medication for two weeks straight to achieve the desired effects and once achieved to maintain them by the taking the product twice a week thereafter. Is he in violation of FDA they are the ones that the rules on medications not home town doctors and he is at risk for his insurance to go up should I file a claim on him. However if it will do the same over a longer amount of time I'm fine without pursuing that Avenue. my main concern I will never achieve what the drug is supposed to do by not taking it correctly.

123, 5, Vaginal burn/post full hysteretomy,NONE,GREAT_ GREAT!  After 4 years of what was misdiagnosed as Interstitial Cystitis_ UTI's_ Vaginal burn finally diagnosed with Andymyosis_ Endometriosis_ Fibroids. Had full lapro hysterectomy removing everything -including ovaries.  Using Vivelle patch but when added Vagifem everything improved immensley.  Best it's felt down there in years.  The first application actually hurt as the estrogen receptors were so starved that they overreact when introduced but after that first day WOW what a relief.  So give it a few applications sticking with it.  The longer you've been deprived down there of steady estrogen from fibroids or other uterine related disease_ atrophy the more the receptors will react which at first is not pleasant but it does get better as they get what they need. As the estrogen receptors get more saturated with the Vagifem it just gets better.  The Vivelle patch is great but just couldn't get to the local direct application like the Vagifem can.  A combo of both works well.  Also noticed post hyster went into deep depression_ weeping from surgical menopause. The Vagidem really lifted my mood right away.  Feeling like my old self at about 5 weeks post hyster and only a week on Vagifem.  Before Vagifem felt empty.  The Vagifem definitely brought me back.  Highly recommend.  No side effects at all.  Super easy to use.  Just use before bed.  No mess or fuss. Best stuff ever.,F,46,1  weeks,7/14/2009,Vagifem
