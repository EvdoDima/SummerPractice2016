1, 5, Hypogonadism,Hypertension,"Wow!  This drug has had a definite positive impact in my life.  Lots more intimacy with my wife.  Raise and promotion coming.  Better in social situations.  My doctor advised me to apply it to the smooth hairless skin under my arm; I apply it on the under side of my arm and down from my armpit.  It takes some ""getting used to_"" but this way it's not as messy as the other commenters indicate.  And yes_ I promise_ it works.",M,42,2  months20 MG 1X D,5/7/2015Email,Axiron
2, 2, low testosterone levels,Tear in underarm skin due to skin sticking together while raising arms during the day. No other physical side effects. In fact there were no effects at all.,The application was nonsensical. How a reputable company like Lily could market this process is a bewilderment to me. It dripped down the sides of my abdomen. The instructions are to apply after deodorant. So what that winds up doing is removing the deodorant. Then there's the issue of the skin under the arms  sticking  together during the day and eventually tearing my skin. After 2 applications of 30 mg. only increased my testosterone from 240 to 247_ the endocrinologist increased dosing to 4 pumps_ which only raised the level further to 253. The results are not worth the annoyance of the application process. I am weaning myself off of the product.,M,64,9  weeks120mg 1X D,2/9/2014,Axiron
3, 4, hypogonadism,The product is watery like rubbing alcohol which makes it run off armpit very easily.  The alcohol in Axiron is hard on underarm skin and any raw or red areas will hurt like hell when you apply.  Armpit hair causes the product to spray onto hand when applying.,Considering I rarely get all of the product applied without dripping some off I seem to be feeling a lot better since starting with axiron.  While it is messy I think it is way better than sticky androgel on your back and abs or stinky testim.  So far its the best topical T I have used in the last 5 years.  I'm on 2 squirts and will have T checked in another month or so.,,57,2  months60 1X D,10/8/2013,Axiron
4, 1, Low Testosterone,Smelled like solvent under your arm. It took forever to apply and to dry. During the day the underarm became sticky when sweating. The applicator was a joke which caused solution to spill even when applying very carefully.,I was was diagnosed with low T with a number of 235 and started with 30 mg (1 swiping application under each arm) once a day. Went back after 90 days and found that T number only went up to 273. The doctor increased my dosage to 60 mgs (2 swiping applications under each arm) once a day. Went back for another T count 30 days later and it went down to 157. I had a complete thyroid blood test and everything was normal. Apparently I was not absorbing this T solution. I've now started 200 mg of injected testosterone cypionate every 2 weeks to begin with and will be re-evaluated in 90 days to adjust dosage until desired number. Doctor said most older guys go to this method because the transdermal methods may not work. The injections are much easier than trying to put this solution under your arm each day. That was a real pain. Injections are painless and will be a direct route instead of wondering if solution is absorbing.,M,64,4  months60 mg 1X D,5/25/2013Email,Axiron
