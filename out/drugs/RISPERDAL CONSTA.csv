0, 1, forced: substance-induced psychosis,Complete soul and mind destroyer. My brain feels like an empty shell. Almost everything that was 'me' has been erased - thoughts_ memories etc. I'm no longer a human. This drug has taken away everything that made me human. No longer have a soul and my mind is so weak now that it functions at the level of a chimpanzee. Can't understand anything I read or hear any more. The whole world has disappeared. Don't recognize family any more. Am completely disconnected from everything. Friends no longer exist in my awareness. Each moment is lived in intense shock. There's no real memory left to speak of or whatever is left is but a faint whisper and without any soul attached to it. Pure blank. I have lost almost all my God given intelligence. I have even been eternally damned the drug has destroyed that much of my brain/mind. Much of what I have learned in life has been erased. It's like this drug just shredded up my brain tissue to nothing. God has left my awareness. There is no more God or 'me,Started the injections in March 2015 and ended May 2015 yet it only got worse after they were stopped. Month by month my brain/mind kept deteriorating_ becoming more void like; empty of anything human like; emotion_ conscience_ creativity_ intelligence. And it keeps getting worse and the fear grows deeper and deeper. WHAT HAS THIS DRUG DONE TO ME? I am no more. End of life_ end of soul eternally. I can't believe I have to be like this forever more even beyond the death of my body. What an horrendous curse. Never in my wildest imaginings could I have anticipated such incredible loss of 'me'_ everything that I am. No memory of yesterday_ just stuck in this moment to moment loveless_ mindless void. I wonder is there any chance whatsoever of anything being healed or brought back to life! Yet almost 8 months after having stopped the injections my mind keeps slipping away more and more. It's like the poison just keeps seeping deeper and deeper into my brain. I'll be more than a vegetable in no time by the looks of it. Just what exactly do they put into these injections? Anyone have anything to tell me that could give me some hope?,M,36,2  months35 mg 2X M,1/10/2016Email,Risperdal consta

Menstrual periods have resumed with heavy bleeding and cramps_ clotting. I deal with this for 8-10 days_ then have two weeks w/o my period before the bleeding resumes. I never thought about suicide before this drug_ now I am so despondent about the lingering side effects that I think about ending my life daily. I would never hurt my family by actually taking my life_ but I pray for God to take me in my sleep every night. This drug stole my life. I am a shell of my former self. I was a computer programmer with a successful career and a satisfying social life. Now_ I can't carry on a conversation and I can't retain new information. This drug has ruined my life_ I suggest researching alternative methods of treatment if you have an adverse reaction to steroids.,F,43,5  months25 mg 2X M,1/30/2014,Risperdal consta

I was hospitalized for about one month and a half (arrested we mean_ and the only people who knows this_ is whom already passed through the same). I started with the maximum dose_ 50 mg and i stayed there for a few months_ they lowered me to 37.5_ where I stayed for a few months and i am now at the lowest dose that is 25 mg. At the time of receiving the injection i'm in an absolute terror because i know I'll feel bad again and I'm always terrified when the day of receiving it is approaching. Apparently there is a lot more people than the general people think_ that is currently in the same situation as me_ and know this is terrifying. It seems it is a widespread phenomenon_ a witch hunt in the XXI century_ 'diagnose' and drugging. Yes_ I'm being forced drugging me_ if i offer the least resistance_ I was warned_ I will be hospitalized again_ against my will. I had never thought of suicide until i started with this 'treatment'. This is not treatment_ is torture_ and I think many of them who prescribe this drugs know that.This is all pure merchandising.,M,22,1  years25 mg 2X M,4/11/2011Email,Risperdal consta
15, 5, Schizoaffective/Schizophrenia,NONE,I have no side effects from Risperdal Consta. I was put on this when I was hospitalized and I haven't been hospitalized since. I really love this medication. The only problem with it is that it kind of wears off close to the next injection date_ so I have to also take 700 mg of Seroquel daily. With the Seroquel_ I never notice it wearing off_ and I have never felt this good. I plan to never get off of my medications now.,F,22,5  months50 MG 2X M,7/26/2010Email,Risperdal consta
