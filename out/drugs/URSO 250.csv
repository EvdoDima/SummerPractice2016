0, 4, Gall bladder,Stayed with 1 pill a day.  Two pills a day caused loose stools and some indigestion,I have polyp in the gall bladder which impeeds flow of bile into the stomach.  SEVERE bloating resulted and small dose of Ursodiol virtually stopped this.  Prescribed 2 a day (one @ breakfast / 1 @ dinner)  Stopped the dinner pill as I don't eat a large dinner and often would cause loose stools and some minor indigestion.,F,36,2  weeks,9/8/2009,Urso 250
1, 5, primary biliary cirrhosis,none,Seems to be an extremely benign drug. Made the elevated liver enzymes go down and presumably slowed the disease progression but it's hard to assess that. There is no cure.,F,69,12  years,5/11/2009,Urso 250
