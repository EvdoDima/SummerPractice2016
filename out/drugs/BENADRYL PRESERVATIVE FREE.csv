2, 4, Allergies_ allergic reactions,Only side effect I ever have is a bit of drowsiness.,Works good.  After a couple doses the drowsiness is reduced_ for me anyway.,M,35, ,9/29/2009,Benadryl preservative free
3, 4, Medication Allergy,Worked great. Had a really bad allergy reaction to a medication and after speaking with my doc_ he suggested I try benydryl for instant relief.  It started working within the hour.  I totally recommend for intstant allergy relief. However_ the only drawback is you do become drowsy and it takes a while to leave your system.  Definetly not something to take afte 9pm as you will wake up extremely groggy.,,F,24,3  days,12/26/2007,Benadryl preservative free
