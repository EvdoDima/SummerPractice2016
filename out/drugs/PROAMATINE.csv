0, 4, vasovagal syncope,Tingly scalp_ sudden urinary urges_ dry eyes,"This was prescribed after an a-fib episode that put me in cardiac icu for a couple of day. During my stay in the hospital step-down unit_ I had a tilt table test which I ""failed"" spectacularly. I had been having extreme dizzy spells for a year prior_ especially bad when walking or exercising (which I had quit because of)_ and sometimes even when sitting! Midodrine really is effective at keeping my energy levels up_ and making me feel normal.  But like another reviewer noted_ it is short lived_ so when the effects wear off in about 4 hours after a dosage_ I start to have symptoms again.  Also_ it is ill advised to take within 3-4 hours of laying down_ which sometimes is inconvenient when I'd like to take a nap_ but then remember that I took my medicine too recently.",F,41,3  years5 mg 3X D,8/10/2012,Proamatine
1, 4, neurocardiogenic syncope,none!,Have been taking midodrine for about 10 months. After several months it became less effective for me but i still take it 3 times a day and if i feel bad just take an extra one. It still helps a lot,F,21,10  months,12/7/2009,Proamatine
2, 5, low blood pressure/syncope,tingly scalp_ goosebumps_ chills_ itchy scalp.  The only one that really bothers me is the itchy scalp.  It can be embarrassing and very uncomfortable,It was a miracle drug for me.  I was almost totally bedridden due to orthostatic hypotension.  Whenever I would stand my BP would drop so low I would be on the verge of fainting.  Even sitting was difficult.  After taking midodrine I was able to resume most normal activities.  It was truly amazing!,F,51,3  months,11/23/2009,Proamatine
3, 3, Syncope_ hypotension,Tingling and itchy feeling in my scalp. tingling in my skin and a bit irritability.,I took this to try to help me stop having episodes of syncope. I was passing out nearly 3 times a day. Unfortunately this drug wasn't enough to stop it and I had to get a pacemaker. Since the pacemaker I don't pass out. I still take the poamatine though. So the two together seem to work. If your doc talks about getting a pacemaker I wouldn't avoid it_ just get it_ I feel so much better with it.,F,24,6  months,10/14/2008,Proamatine
4, 2, low blood pressure/dizziness,Fatigue_ nausea,Did not provide the rise in blood pressure that I needed to avoid a pacemaker.  Ended up having to get a pacemaker.,F,24,3  months,9/29/2006,Proamatine
