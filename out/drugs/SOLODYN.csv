0, 1, Rash,Facial swelling_ blurry vision_ more rash,After taking solodyn for 10 days I ended up with swollen face_ horrible itchy rash_ blurry vision. I stopped taking it 6 days ago and half of my face is still swollen. One of my nostrils is closed_ one eye is blurry.i have facial numbness. I was instructed by a nurse to stop taking it and  my doctor did not even bother calling me back even though I requested to speak to him. It says that it takes 16 hours to flush out of your system. BS. It's been  6 days and I am still suffering. Shame .,F,43,10  days65MG,4/18/2015,Solodyn
1, 1, Cystic acne,"We are in a living hell due to this medication which triggered an autoimmune response in my then 14-year old son. He continues to struggle with daily abdominal pain_ nausea_ vomiting_ and bowel issues 2 years after stopping this medication. His derm was very defensive and refuses to concede that this med triggered all of this_ but she now has Solodyn listed as an allergy on his chart & will not place him on any oral meds for his acne due to his ""sensitivity.""  My child never had any kind of GI issues prior to taking Solodyn_ but ended up in & out of the hospital after taking it for about 1.5 months. He lost over 20 lbs & missed 2 months of school initially due to his extreme GI issues and he continues to suffer daily -- it breaks my heart!  Do NOT take this medication_ it is horrible. I would give anything to be able to turn the clock back & to never have consented to try this med!!!",,M,14,2  months,9/25/2013,Solodyn
2, 1, Acne,Joint pain_ nausea_ vomiting_ dark urine_ itching_ headache_ elevated liver function tests.,This drug triggered autoimmune hepatitis in my 17 year old daughter.  She was very ill and had to take a high dose of prednisone for 9 months to reduce the inflammation in her liver.  Please stay away from this drug.,F,17,5  months 1X D,7/9/2012Email,Solodyn
3, 5, peri-menopausal acne,None that I can tell.,I was concerned when I developed acne and rosacea for the first time at age 44. After trying a few topical medicines that did not work_ solodyn worked beautifully. It is expensive_ though.,F,45,120  days 1X D,5/7/2011Email,Solodyn

5, 3, cystic acne,Continual yeast infection that does not respond to prescription medicine treatment as the anitbiotic is a long term daily medicine.,Medicine works great for my face.  Little harsh on the stomach_ but I often have tolerance or nausea with tetracycline products.  The recurring yeast infections from the medicine are to the point of unbearable and I may have to discontinue use of the product,F,40,  1X D,12/13/2010,Solodyn
6, 5, acne,I was on other meds for other things so not sure what side effects this caused.,I was suffering from cystic acne. It was horrible. This cleared it up in about 2 months. I was maybe getting one small zit when I started my period but other then that all acne was gone. It was so great and a great alternative to more extreme drug like Accutane. I had to stop taking it due to insurance changes and it wasnt covered and my face broke back out again_ maybe worse now. That is the bad part I guess. Also_ its very expensive without good insurance. I miss it so much!,F,31,1  years130 1X D,5/10/2010,Solodyn
