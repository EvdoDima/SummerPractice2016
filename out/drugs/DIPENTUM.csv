0, 5, crohn's,Can cause minor stomach ache sometimes but nothing that doesn't go away pretty quickly. No bad side effects.,Have had wonderful luck with this drug. Even after flares and a round of Entocort_ it keeps me in check.  Would recommend it highly before all the drugs with horrible side effects!,F,59,4  years2x250mg 2X D,4/29/2012,Dipentum
