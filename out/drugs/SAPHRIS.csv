0, 1, bipolar1 mixedtype psychotic episod,"On it I ""passed out and blacked out"" the 1st & only time I ever took it. About 45 minutes later I barely made it over to my couch and then I lost the next 24 hours. During that time I am told I had 3 phone conversations I cannot remember at all. I am no drug lightweight_ I am a good size adult female_ have been taking various psych meds for 25 years and can tough them out usually but this one kicked my ass. I gave all my free samples back and I will never take Saphris again. If you are starting it I highly recommend you do not be alone when you first take it. In the words of Clint Eastwood I guess you have to ask yourself if you feel lucky.",Maybe it's just personal preference but I don't like the idea of taking something that instantly dissolves on your tongue. No way you can puke it back up or even spit it out if it hits you wrong_ plus it made my mouth feel weird. Also they say not to drink anything for a certain amount of time after you take it and I didn't like that either because I'm always thirsty from my meds. If Saphris helps you that is great; however_ this Rx and I did not get along. I felt like it could have killed me. If I wanted to be a zombie I would rather just stay psychotic.  God knows what damage I might have done or had done to me while I was in a blackout from it.,F,60,1  days,7/4/2016,Saphris

6, 4, Bipolar_ PTSD,The usual dry mouth_ tongue numbness,I wanted to let everyone know who's take this and have problems with dry mouth_ canker sores_ numbness_ I don't have trouble like you do even though I get the dry mouth and numb tongue. What works for me for dry mouth is to use biotene spray every time your mouth gets dry_ maybe even use it preventatively. It works great and as long as your mouth has the proper moisture_ maybe that will eliminate the sores and burns which I've here'd others describe suffering. As for the tongue numbness_ it doesn't bother me and goes away quickly. Biotene also relieves the numbness in my opinion. I hope this helps all who report bad effects.,M,,1  weeks5 MG 1X D,4/4/2016Email,Saphris
7, 3, Major depression_ insomnia,Dry mouth_ canker sores_ numb feeling_ slight anxiety before I fall asleep and did I say DRY MOUTH?!?!?!,This was amazing. It allowed me a restful sleep and increased me energy the next day. I stopped taking it after a ten days as I couldn't take the dry mouth and cankers totally covering my tongue_ cheek and even my tonsils. Dry mouth I had to stop. My doctor then asked me to try Seroquel and that made me sleep constantly and agitated.  So two weeks ago we switched to Olanzapine and the weight gain in just two weeks is terrible. As well_ I would be drowsy all day and zero focus or concentration.I missed how Saphris made me feel so last night I decided to try it again. I'm hoping that perhaps the dry mouth will improve after continued use?  Can anyone help to explain how they coped with severe dry mouth 24/7?,F,53,1  times5mg,1/26/2016Email,Saphris
8, 5, Schizophrenia/anxiety/paranoia,Occasional dizziness_ slight increase in temp.,I would recommend this to anyone who needs an anti-psychotic medication. I see people who stopped taking it after 1 or 2 days and gave it a bad review. That's truly not fair. In order to give any drug a fair review you need to be on it for roughly 6 weeks. After about the first week symptoms start to go away. This medication has given me the ability to function. As for the cost_ you can get it directly from the manufacturer for free. I don't pay a penny for it.,F,24,1  months5mg,1/20/2016,Saphris

17, 1, bipolar I,the first time i took saphris was the day i was diagnosed for GAD_ depression and BP1_ with BP1 being unexpected. aside from the other drugs prescribed (valium_ lexapro) which were helpful thus far_ my experience with saphris was crazy. i was to take it at night for 2 weeks. after i had taken it_ it took 30mins or so for effects to take place. i started feeling sleepy_ then decided to go to bed. when i finally settled in_ i started getting mini spasms_ causing me to curl up unintentionally over the span of i assume was 30mins (but it felt longer). i decided to get up_ all drowsy and feeling like a zombie. i went to get food because i oddly felt very hungry. so i was basically walking around the house trying to get something to eat_ while being half-asleep. when i finally got to sleep_ the next day i woke up 5 hours later than usual. it was a terrible experience. i stopped taking it after that day.,it also tasted like sh*t and felt like burning under my tongue.,M,25,1  days5mg 1X D,8/16/2015,Saphris

21, 2, severe depression & PTSD,Acid like_ very frightening_ experience on 1/2 a pill (5mg)Elimination of SEVERE depression (but only for about one day),"I have never done acid but the stories sound exactly like what happened to me.Took the medicine. Had this ""Acid like"" experience of auditory_ visual_ tactile hallucinations that lasted about 10 hours. If I moved my body in the slightest way the ""trip"" intensified. To get to bathroom had to hold on to furniture or walls. At some point during this whole thing I cooked food (god only knows how) because I woke up with huge mixing bowl with leftover homemade mac and cheese in my bed and a trashed kitchen.To me the ""trip"" was frightening as h*ll. But the strangest thing happened. When I came out of this horrifying experience it was as though someone had gone inside my brain and scrubbed it. Made it sparkly new. There was no depression the next morning. Not like mania but soooo happy to have the darkness lifted for a moment (about a day). I swore I would NEVER take any more new psyc meds.However_ its now many months later and the depression became unbearable again. I took 1/2 a pill 28 hours ago. Was drunk as a skunk for about 12 hours. Holding onto walls to walk. No hallucinations that i remember this time. Slowly eased into a sober state. I thought I was aware of the full experience but I just checked my blood sugar (am diabetic) & it is 250 yet I have ZERO memory of eating any food. However - yet again - brain scrub feeling. Depression LIFTED! Feel clear headed with occasional wave of drunk feeling that lasts only seconds. Feel hopeful an",F,49,1  days5mg,6/6/2015,Saphris
22, 1, Bipolar II mixed rapid cycling,Tongue_ mouth numb for 18+ hours.  I only took 1 dose at night around 10:30pm.   20 min after taking it I was a complete zombie_ I had to be helped to bed by husband.  Stumbling_ tripping and talking nonsense.  Woke up 5 times during night.  Third time husband heard me banging into walls trying to get to bathroom.  Bad bruising on shoulder from this.  Finally stayed up after 5th time waking.,"Dr. had given this to me for my bipolar depression.  I am highly sensitive to medications like Seroquel and I took 12.5mg at night for sleep.  I also suffered very adverse reactions to Depakote and I feel that this medication produced very similar effects.  When I got up for the 5th time and stayed up my body felt jittery_ my eyes were burning_ red and my eyeballs felt like they were ""jiggling"" on their own_ I was desperately thirsty and starving but nauseous.  Like I said before_ my mouth stayed numb for about 18+ hours.  I will never take this medication again.

39, 5, BiPolar II_ Depression_ PTSD,Increased appetite right after taking the medicine_ weight gain_ numbness in mouth_ sleepiness.,THIS MEDICINE HAS SAVED MY LIFE!! I no longer have the constant negative dialog running through my mind. Yes_ I WAS suicidal. Saphris has also helped with the depression and the inability to concentrate. Since taking this medicine I am now able and look forward to the simple tasks of my day; housework_ paying bills_ cooking_ lunch dates with my girlfriends_ and I am now even volunteering in my granddaughter's class every week. I am able to get out of bed now and do my hair and make-up after showering because I want to and not because I have to. This medicine tastes horrid; very pungent like a fermented grape seed_ hence the numbness. And you have to allow it to dissolve under your tongue and not drink or eat anything for 10 minutes. It has caused me to gain some weight but I don't care; at least I'm still here. A little RLS but it subsided. Hopefully the weight gain will subside as well.Thank God for Saphris!,F,52,3  weeks10 1X D,9/24/2014Email,Saphris

Got restless legs to start with which settled with Cogentin 2mg administered just before I took the Saphris. You even get used to the taste! However major increase in appetite was too much for me.,This drug is definitely worth a try for a range of symptoms. The deal breaker for me was the hunger_ both immediately after taking it but also leftover hunger effects into the next day. I gained heaps of weight in a short time-frame! Its a shame as not everyone on here has had that effect so I was just unlucky!,F,46,3  weeks10mg 1X D,11/3/2013,Saphris

I feel functional on it. If I accidentally skip a dose the next day I am really depressed. Before this med I would have suicidal thoughts daily. I barely had nightmares before this med somehow put up with it for so long then started a med to help with nightmares but it didn't work at all. The nightmares I have are severe. Hellish. Demonic. I have placed an order for Latuda today as I cannot stand the nightmares any longer but Saphris worked wonders for my depression.

53, 5, Bipolar,I would recommend saphris to take with a mood stabilizer. I used to be only on 150mg of lamictal but that sent me into an extremely bad low. I had a migraine for a week straight_ was extremely exhausted no matter how many hours I slept_ fell asleep every where_ and of course_ wanted to kill myself. Saphris 5mg was prescribed to me and it started working the next day. It's been great so far. I'm not feeling any rapid cycles and have been sleeping well. I did skip a pill which caused me to take two throughout my day (morning and night) which was not a good idea because my mood changed for a day or two. At first I was extremely lethargic after taking saphris. It was not a good feeling_ I felt extremely high. But it went away after two or three days. Saphris saved my life_ I completely recommend it.,,F,19,3  weeks5,6/15/2013,Saphris

I am also talking amitriptyline and clonazepam for the same symptoms_ but they were simply not putting me out. I've had insomnia all my life. Saphris cured it from day 1 and at the start_ the quality of my sleep was also improved in that I awoke with more energy. Over time_ I've become more lethargic although Saphris still knocks me out cold. Every night. It seems to have had little overall effect on my depression or anxiety_ though. In fact_ my social anxiety seems to be worse. The carb cravings have gone_ finally_ though it tough the first month.,M,43,2  months5mg 1X D,6/3/2013,Saphris

Some trouble falling asleep.,I take saphris a half hour before I go to bed because even 5mg knocks me out. A little sleepy in the morning_ but worth it after the good night sleeps. My shakey hands went away after 2 weeks. Once in a while my arm or leg might fall asleep but not for long. No cognitive side effects. **DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL** My experience: 4 beers with friends_ I didn't feel the alcohol but I did pass out on the toilet. Also I took 20mg for 1 week and was miserable. I felt extremely restless. 15mg is golden for me. No mania_ no hypomania_ no rapid cycling_ and I still feel like myself!,F,25,2  months15 1X D,4/26/2013,Saphris

Within the first few days I reached a scary level of happiness. I began to have racing thoughts_ talking fast and being completely irrational. Soon after I began hallucinating that I knew every stranger in a different from school or work all day. I had the cops called on me for having a breakdown over thinking my dead grandmother was still alive to a woman and the ambulance took me to the ER. There I exclaimed to the entire ER  to listen to me because I was Obama (I'm a white girl)_ had a seizure_ risked falling into a coma_ and stayed in the psych ward for 2 days when recovered. All because I took Saphris that was prescribed to me. It was terrifying and life altering.,F,24,8  days5 mg 1X D,3/24/2013,Saphris

It numbs the underside of your tongue a little_ but you get used to it and the numbness goes away in a few minutes. Would definitely recommend this medication!,,F,40,3  days10mg,12/29/2012,Saphris

Helped me sleep but did not help with agitation or hypomania during the day. Switched to Vistaral after 10 days. Next day extreme aggitation ending with suicidal ideation and crisis unit stay. Not sure if one dose of Vistaral or stopping Saphris caused the suicidal ideation_  but it resolved in a couple of hours.,,F,48,10  days5 mg,10/24/2012,Saphris
64, 3, Bi-Polar II- depression and anxiety,This medicine has helped me somewhat with depression.  I think I need to up the dose though.  I may need to take something with it for anxiety_ but I'm not sure.  This medicine can make you restless.  I don't have the restless leg thing_ but I do get an inner restlessness if I don't take it with Inderal.  I've heard you can also try taking Saphris with a drug called Cogentin to combat the restlessness.  Other than the agitation_ numbness of the mouth after taking it_ and the unpleasant taste_ I'd say this drug is pretty good.,,F,34,1  months10 mg 1X D,10/6/2012Email,Saphris

66, 5, Bi-polar with depression,When I  first starting taking  Saphris at the recommended dose_ it made me very hyper and alert. It felt like I did some speed_ and I was a ball of energy. After a full week of that we cut back to 5mg for the whole day. Still too much_ put me in a maniac spending spree. After several weeks_ we went down to 2.5mg a day and for the last seven months_ I am doing fabulous. The perfect dose for me was not the recommended dose and never is. I am very sensitive to the normal dose that most people take_ other then that I have no bad side effects only good.,I have tried a lot of different medications over the years like_ Celexa_Lexapro_Lamictal_Neurotin_Depakoe_Trileptal_Cymbalta_Wellbutrin_ those are the ones I can remember anyways_and nothing has worked has well as the Saphris has. I have a lot of Anxiety and so with the Saphris_ I also take 0.5mg of Klonopin once or twice a day as needed and 100mg of Wellbutrin Hr. I have no suicidal thoughts anymore_ it made my stomach issues go away I don`t get depressed like I use to once a month. Thank you_ Thank you_ for this wonderful drug you made for us bi-polar people.

68, 5, Bipolar (mixed episodes),Numb tounge after taking it. Tiredness. If I take 10mg once I get Rls. Get really hungry after taking it..obsessive thoughts about food. hah,This medication is amazing but if I miss a dose I regret it. It really stables me out. The crying spells and extreme irritability is gone. No racing thoughts. I also suffer from horrible anxiety and this helped tremendously.  It did make me gain weight in the beginning but really I take it at night and just refuse to eat so I dont gain weight. Or if I am just to hungry to sleep I'll drink a protein shake. This drug has given me my life back with little side effects. I've seriously tried almost everything out there my doctor was running out of options and he put me on this and it was like a miracle. I finally feel normal and I can function. If I'm having a real emotional day or feeling very stressed then I  take a half of a 5 and feel so much better in 30 to 45 mins. This drug is amazing. I never want to get off of it. It just sucks that it cost so much but well I'll pay that price verses being on medications with a ton of horrible side effects. LOVE IT! And on a side note_ I have a horrible time with medications because of side effects. This is the first one that I can be on and its all bearable.,F,23,2  years5x1 1X D,5/17/2012Email,Saphris
69, 5, Bipolar 1_ mixed_ rapid cycling,"I went on this drug when I could no longer take the weight gain related to Zyprexa. I had heard from my psychiatrist  Saphris was molecularly similar to Zyprexa but without the gargantuan appetite side effect. I am glad I switched. While Saphris does give me a sudden urge to pig out_ this sensation lasts just 15 minutes and then the drug knocks me out for the night_ whereas Zyprexa would boost my appetite all day and night. Saphris has helped me feel calm and even more spiritually connected. My only complaint is that it makes sleep come rather suddenly -- I don't ""drift off.""  And I sleep 8 hours no more_ no less on it. Had to get back on coffee to clear the morning drowsiness of this drug_ but all-in-all I am very happy to have made the switch. I am now in a weight loss program to lose the Zyprexa poundage_ and I feel like I have my life back.",There is an unflavored and a black cherry version of this drug. insist on the black cherry and make sure the doctor writes this on the prescription or the pharmacy might fill with the regular stuff.

We are getting very close to side-effect free medication_ the libido issue is pretty much all that remains at this point.   Might I add that this drug is better for the schizophrenia itself rather than Zyprexa_ overall_ a major improvement.,I read somewhere that this drug s chemically similar to Zyprexa_ so it may be a good option for people that want to wean themselves off of Zyprexa.

I will periodically update my reviews if anything major changes,Some say weight gain but I'm not hungry on this so far. I already take lorazepam .5mg 3x per day_ 20mg Prozac started when I started Saphris so that could be helping too. I also take Keppra 500mg 2x per day_ vyvanse 70mg per day_ temazepam 30mg at night which I still need apparently. Saphris isn't knocking me out like others have reported. I also take flexeril for my back 10mg 3x per day. So far so good!My doctor said its known as the new and improved Seroquel without the weight gain but its only been five days. Seroquel put 50lbs on me over five years so about 10lbs per year. I've never been this heavy so I hope Saphris doesn't do that to me.,F,42,5  days10mg 1X D,3/11/2012Email,Saphris

80, 5, Bipolar II,I have experienced: (1) A numbing effect on parts of the mouth exposed to the dissolving pill.  It's similar to the effect of an over the counter oral analgesic; lasts maybe an hour.   (2) Sleepiness.  Given a choice_ take it just before bed.  After taking it about a week_ the sleepiness is less pronounced.  (3) First night only: sleepiness was extreme; had a restless feeling while falling to asleep particular in my legs. (4) Waking up with a leftover taste in my mouth very much like I would get when I was a smoker.  I've found that keeping my tongue out of my mouth (I'm serious!) until well after the pill dissolves prevents this *and* reduces the numbing effect.  The downside is that I miss the taste of that black cherry goodness.,"Wow.  Some of my feelings and experiences:(1) I felt the effects the very next morning; a HUGE difference from the weeks-long wait for antidepressants and mood stabilizers.  My mood went from a marginally ""not-bad"" to a full blown ""good"" and reached ""very good"" in another two days.  I was able to get things done including a couple of tasks that were pending for almost 18 months.(2) Mild calming effect. Anxiety (unrelated to external sources) has never been a notable problem for me but it seems most likely it has been with me at a low ""background noise"" level. (3)  Very mild euphoria.  I'm closely monitoring myself: am I in a low-level hypomanic state? Perhaps_ but I'm finding it very easy to exert self control.  It may well just be feeling good about feeling good.(4) I *do* have racing thoughts from time to time but they aren't scattered; more ""rushing"" with deliberation than ""racing"" aimlessly. Note that I have subclinical ADD (a common comorbidity as I understand it).(5) Within a period of 24 hours I learned a lot: I missed a dose yesterday. While clearing out dust covered computer equipment to accomplish (success!) those 18 month old tasks_ I misplaced my pills. I called my doctor in the AM to call in a prescription. In early PM I discovered that I'd have to wait until tomorrow.",M,51,11  days5 1X D,11/1/2011,Saphris
81, 4, Bipolar I,Restlessness; Insomnia; Difficulty swallowing (usually last about 1.5 hours after administration),Lamictal seems to have conquered the depressive episodes of my bipolar_ but I've been struggling with persistent mania for over a year.  I've tried at least 5 of the main anti-manics to no available.  My main symptoms were extreme irritability_ debilitating anxiety_ hyperactivity and insomnia.  To my amazement_  I'd have to say the saphris has pretty much conquered the irritability and anxiety.  However_ my sleep cycle is still erratic.  Also_ I'm still exercising excessively (about 4-5 hours a day of swimming and biking.)  I can't sit still_ and have boundless energy even on two hours of sleep.  Still_ life is as good as its been in about three years.  If I could get my sleep normalized and energy levels toned down I could go back to work.,M,37,3  weeks5 MG 2X D,11/1/2011,Saphris

84, 4, schizophrenia,Can't have sex all day long_ but that's about it.,I was taking two anti-psychotics and wellbutrin before switching to saphris.  I stuck with the wellbutrin_ but replaced the two drugs with saphris only.  This drug is great.  It is a MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.  It may turn out to be a blockbuster drug like the one that came out in the nineties that makes you hungry and sleepy all day long but preserved your sexual functioning better than any of the other ones at the time.  I am becoming progressively more sane_ so much so that if I had a disability evaluation in the near future_ I would probably pass.  Economy sucks_ but who knows_ maybe I could get a job modeling.  I have even dropped about five to ten pounds since switching to saphris_ so I am not entirely bsing about modeling work.   Best weight in years. The pharmaceuticals people are getting really close to truly side-effect free medication.  If I were eighteen or twenty five_ I could probably make love four or five or maybe six times a day on this drug.  If only the young guys knew how much the old school anti-psychotics sucked_ they would be begging for a drug like saphris.  What kind of a schizophrenic do you want to be_ one that is remembered for doing something terrible_ or one that is remembered for taking their medication every day_ staying out of trouble and supporting themselves?  I predict that 100% side-effect free medication will be on the horizon in no more than ten or fifteen years.,M,37,6  months5mg 2X D,8/24/2011,Saphris

It is still continuing to where I have to take 0.5 mg of xanax about 3X a day. I called my psychiatrist and she suggested stopping the saphris tonight. I'm also on luvox and had to increase that from 100 to 150 to stop the obsessing about the attacks. I've felt suicidal_ lost_ dreamy_ and terrified.

91, 1, Psychosis and racing thoughts,Another terrible drug I started taking after I was taken off of the Geodon. I only took this drug for maybe three weeks to a month. Just like Geodon it caused the same side effects. Uncontrolable muscle clenching_ panic and anxiety attacks that made me literally want to kill myself. I became almost paranoid at everyday things. Could neither sleep nor eat or drink most of the time. Horrible sweating and disturbing dreams. This drug is very new but even on such a low dose of 5mg per day it was enough to drive me to the edge. The symptoms became so severe I had to be placed in a mental hospital for a week which helped to calm me down_ although not a hundred percent. The drug magnified my symtoms to the extreme and I felt the side effects on and off for months after taking both the Geodon and the Saphris.,I should note that the way the drug was administered was through a lozenge which I placed under my tongue and it dissolved in my mouth. I was taking this drug in April of 2010 until May when I was hospitalized and finally taken off of the drug.,M,26,25  days5 1X D,3/20/2011Email,Saphris

I can't find any other information on this since it's so new and my doctor keeps telling me it's weight neutral but clearly it's not which is too bad. I'm also on prozak 60mg and topamax 500mg for depression and binge/purging. Hope this info helps!,F,30,60  days10MG 1X D,7/31/2010Email,Saphris

107, 4, depression,numbing of tongue_ a little off balance_ created some hunger minutes after taking_ lack of saliva,was so scared to try this drug_ but so glad I did.  I take 40 mg of prozac in the morning and 1 mg of xanax xr at night.  2.5 mg of saphris replaced my sleep medication_ and I slept beautifully.  The first night in months. A little groggy in the morning_ but knew immediately when I woke up that my mood had lifted.  Had my first good day.  Worked for me.  We will see how it goes.  I have never been diagnosed with bipolar_ ect.  Only anxiety_ depression.  Have never taken an anti-psychotic medicine before_ but feel more like myself and am so pleased.,F,36,1  days2.5 mg 1X D,5/1/2010,Saphris
108, 5, Bipolar II,sedation_ brief numbing of my mouth and tongue_ tastes bitter_ groggy the first couple mornings,So far_ I am very satisfied with saphris. I have tried just about every mood stabilizer under the sun_ which all left me with the inability to think_ nausea_ etc... Saphris puts me to sleep quickly_ so I take my dose right at bedtime. I woke up groggy for a couple days_ but after a shower and a cup of coffee_ I felt amazing. I do not feel depressed_ nor do I feel dulled by the medication. What I like best so far_ is that the medication is tempering my racing thoughts_ without turning me into a vegetable. The numbness in my mouth_ and the bitter taste from the medicine are not too bad_ and are less pronounced each subsequent day.I'll be posting another review after a month or so.,M,26,7  days5mg 1X D,4/25/2010,Saphris
