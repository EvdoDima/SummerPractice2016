0, 1, bipolar1 mixedtype psychotic episod,"On it I ""passed out and blacked out"" the 1st & only time I ever took it. About 45 minutes later I barely made it over to my couch and then I lost the next 24 hours. During that time I am told I had 3 phone conversations I cannot remember at all. I am no drug lightweight_ I am a good size adult female_ have been taking various psych meds for 25 years and can tough them out usually but this one kicked my ass. I gave all my free samples back and I will never take Saphris again. If you are starting it I highly recommend you do not be alone when you first take it. In the words of Clint Eastwood I guess you have to ask yourself if you feel lucky.",Maybe it's just personal preference but I don't like the idea of taking something that instantly dissolves on your tongue. No way you can puke it back up or even spit it out if it hits you wrong_ plus it made my mouth feel weird. Also they say not to drink anything for a certain amount of time after you take it and I didn't like that either because I'm always thirsty from my meds. If Saphris helps you that is great; however_ this Rx and I did not get along. I felt like it could have killed me. If I wanted to be a zombie I would rather just stay psychotic.  God knows what damage I might have done or had done to me while I was in a blackout from it.,F,60,1  days,7/4/2016,Saphris

6, 4, Bipolar_ PTSD,The usual dry mouth_ tongue numbness,I wanted to let everyone know who's take this and have problems with dry mouth_ canker sores_ numbness_ I don't have trouble like you do even though I get the dry mouth and numb tongue. What works for me for dry mouth is to use biotene spray every time your mouth gets dry_ maybe even use it preventatively. It works great and as long as your mouth has the proper moisture_ maybe that will eliminate the sores and burns which I've here'd others describe suffering. As for the tongue numbness_ it doesn't bother me and goes away quickly. Biotene also relieves the numbness in my opinion. I hope this helps all who report bad effects.,M,,1  weeks5 MG 1X D,4/4/2016Email,Saphris
7, 3, Major depression_ insomnia,Dry mouth_ canker sores_ numb feeling_ slight anxiety before I fall asleep and did I say DRY MOUTH?!?!?!,This was amazing. It allowed me a restful sleep and increased me energy the next day. I stopped taking it after a ten days as I couldn't take the dry mouth and cankers totally covering my tongue_ cheek and even my tonsils. Dry mouth I had to stop. My doctor then asked me to try Seroquel and that made me sleep constantly and agitated.  So two weeks ago we switched to Olanzapine and the weight gain in just two weeks is terrible. As well_ I would be drowsy all day and zero focus or concentration.I missed how Saphris made me feel so last night I decided to try it again. I'm hoping that perhaps the dry mouth will improve after continued use?  Can anyone help to explain how they coped with severe dry mouth 24/7?,F,53,1  times5mg,1/26/2016Email,Saphris
8, 5, Schizophrenia/anxiety/paranoia,Occasional dizziness_ slight increase in temp.,I would recommend this to anyone who needs an anti-psychotic medication. I see people who stopped taking it after 1 or 2 days and gave it a bad review. That's truly not fair. In order to give any drug a fair review you need to be on it for roughly 6 weeks. After about the first week symptoms start to go away. This medication has given me the ability to function. As for the cost_ you can get it directly from the manufacturer for free. I don't pay a penny for it.,F,24,1  months5mg,1/20/2016,Saphris

17, 1, bipolar I,the first time i took saphris was the day i was diagnosed for GAD_ depression and BP1_ with BP1 being unexpected. aside from the other drugs prescribed (valium_ lexapro) which were helpful thus far_ my experience with saphris was crazy. i was to take it at night for 2 weeks. after i had taken it_ it took 30mins or so for effects to take place. i started feeling sleepy_ then decided to go to bed. when i finally settled in_ i started getting mini spasms_ causing me to curl up unintentionally over the span of i assume was 30mins (but it felt longer). i decided to get up_ all drowsy and feeling like a zombie. i went to get food because i oddly felt very hungry. so i was basically walking around the house trying to get something to eat_ while being half-asleep. when i finally got to sleep_ the next day i woke up 5 hours later than usual. it was a terrible experience. i stopped taking it after that day.,it also tasted like sh*t and felt like burning under my tongue.,M,25,1  days5mg 1X D,8/16/2015,Saphris

21, 2, severe depression & PTSD,Acid like_ very frightening_ experience on 1/2 a pill (5mg)Elimination of SEVERE depression (but only for about one day),"I have never done acid but the stories sound exactly like what happened to me.Took the medicine. Had this ""Acid like"" experience of auditory_ visual_ tactile hallucinations that lasted about 10 hours. If I moved my body in the slightest way the ""trip"" intensified. To get to bathroom had to hold on to furniture or walls. At some point during this whole thing I cooked food (god only knows how) because I woke up with huge mixing bowl with leftover homemade mac and cheese in my bed and a trashed kitchen.To me the ""trip"" was frightening as h*ll. But the strangest thing happened. When I came out of this horrifying experience it was as though someone had gone inside my brain and scrubbed it. Made it sparkly new. There was no depression the next morning. Not like mania but soooo happy to have the darkness lifted for a moment (about a day). I swore I would NEVER take any more new psyc meds.However_ its now many months later and the depression became unbearable again. I took 1/2 a pill 28 hours ago. Was drunk as a skunk for about 12 hours. Holding onto walls to walk. No hallucinations that i remember this time. Slowly eased into a sober state. I thought I was aware of the full experience but I just checked my blood sugar (am diabetic) & it is 250 yet I have ZERO memory of eating any food. However - yet again - brain scrub feeling. Depression LIFTED! Feel clear headed with occasional wave of drunk feeling that lasts only seconds. Feel hopeful an",F,49,1  days5mg,6/6/2015,Saphris
22, 1, Bipolar II mixed rapid cycling,Tongue_ mouth numb for 18+ hours.  I only took 1 dose at night around 10:30pm.   20 min after taking it I was a complete zombie_ I had to be helped to bed by husband.  Stumbling_ tripping and talking nonsense.  Woke up 5 times during night.  Third time husband heard me banging into walls trying to get to bathroom.  Bad bruising on shoulder from this.  Finally stayed up after 5th time waking.,"Dr. had given this to me for my bipolar depression.  I am highly sensitive to medications like Seroquel and I took 12.5mg at night for sleep.  I also suffered very adverse reactions to Depakote and I feel that this medication produced very similar effects.  When I got up for the 5th time and stayed up my body felt jittery_ my eyes were burning_ red and my eyeballs felt like they were ""jiggling"" on their own_ I was desperately thirsty and starving but nauseous.  Like I said before_ my mouth stayed numb for about 18+ hours.  I will never take this medication again.

39, 5, BiPolar II_ Depression_ PTSD,Increased appetite right after taking the medicine_ weight gain_ numbness in mouth_ sleepiness.,THIS MEDICINE HAS SAVED MY LIFE!! I no longer have the constant negative dialog running through my mind. Yes_ I WAS suicidal. Saphris has also helped with the depression and the inability to concentrate. Since taking this medicine I am now able and look forward to the simple tasks of my day; housework_ paying bills_ cooking_ lunch dates with my girlfriends_ and I am now even volunteering in my granddaughter's class every week. I am able to get out of bed now and do my hair and make-up after showering because I want to and not because I have to. This medicine tastes horrid; very pungent like a fermented grape seed_ hence the numbness. And you have to allow it to dissolve under your tongue and not drink or eat anything for 10 minutes. It has caused me to gain some weight but I don't care; at least I'm still here. A little RLS but it subsided. Hopefully the weight gain will subside as well.Thank God for Saphris!,F,52,3  weeks10 1X D,9/24/2014Email,Saphris

Got restless legs to start with which settled with Cogentin 2mg administered just before I took the Saphris. You even get used to the taste! However major increase in appetite was too much for me.,This drug is definitely worth a try for a range of symptoms. The deal breaker for me was the hunger_ both immediately after taking it but also leftover hunger effects into the next day. I gained heaps of weight in a short time-frame! Its a shame as not everyone on here has had that effect so I was just unlucky!,F,46,3  weeks10mg 1X D,11/3/2013,Saphris
49, 3, depression/ bipolar,CONSTANT SEVERE NIGHTMARES. 10 MG was too much for me and made me very irritable and depressed.,This medication has been the only medication of many to actually help with my depression. I feel functional on it. If I accidentally skip a dose the next day I am really depressed. Before this med I would have suicidal thoughts daily. I barely had nightmares before this med somehow put up with it for so long then started a med to help with nightmares but it didn't work at all. The nightmares I have are severe. Hellish. Demonic. I have placed an order for Latuda today as I cannot stand the nightmares any longer but Saphris worked wonders for my depression.

53, 5, Bipolar,I would recommend saphris to take with a mood stabilizer. I used to be only on 150mg of lamictal but that sent me into an extremely bad low. I had a migraine for a week straight_ was extremely exhausted no matter how many hours I slept_ fell asleep every where_ and of course_ wanted to kill myself. Saphris 5mg was prescribed to me and it started working the next day. It's been great so far. I'm not feeling any rapid cycles and have been sleeping well. I did skip a pill which caused me to take two throughout my day (morning and night) which was not a good idea because my mood changed for a day or two. At first I was extremely lethargic after taking saphris. It was not a good feeling_ I felt extremely high. But it went away after two or three days. Saphris saved my life_ I completely recommend it.,,F,19,3  weeks5,6/15/2013,Saphris

I am also talking amitriptyline and clonazepam for the same symptoms_ but they were simply not putting me out. I've had insomnia all my life. Saphris cured it from day 1 and at the start_ the quality of my sleep was also improved in that I awoke with more energy. Over time_ I've become more lethargic although Saphris still knocks me out cold. Every night. It seems to have had little overall effect on my depression or anxiety_ though. In fact_ my social anxiety seems to be worse. The carb cravings have gone_ finally_ though it tough the first month.,M,43,2  months5mg 1X D,6/3/2013,Saphris

Some trouble falling asleep.,I take saphris a half hour before I go to bed because even 5mg knocks me out. A little sleepy in the morning_ but worth it after the good night sleeps. My shakey hands went away after 2 weeks. Once in a while my arm or leg might fall asleep but not for long. No cognitive side effects. **DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL** My experience: 4 beers with friends_ I didn't feel the alcohol but I did pass out on the toilet. Also I took 20mg for 1 week and was miserable. I felt extremely restless. 15mg is golden for me. No mania_ no hypomania_ no rapid cycling_ and I still feel like myself!,F,25,2  months15 1X D,4/26/2013,Saphris

Within the first few days I reached a scary level of happiness. I began to have racing thoughts_ talking fast and being completely irrational. Soon after I began hallucinating that I knew every stranger in a different from school or work all day. I had the cops called on me for having a breakdown over thinking my dead grandmother was still alive to a woman and the ambulance took me to the ER. There I exclaimed to the entire ER  to listen to me because I was Obama (I'm a white girl)_ had a seizure_ risked falling into a coma_ and stayed in the psych ward for 2 days when recovered. All because I took Saphris that was prescribed to me. It was terrifying and life altering.,F,24,8  days5 mg 1X D,3/24/2013,Saphris
