4, 5, BiPolar Disorder 1,Insomnia (go to sleep fine_wake frequently through the night)_dry mouth/thirst at night_strange/vivid dreams_ vision is completely whacked_ night sweats.& I seem to have trouble spelling (worse than normal) which is something I haven't read anyone else here having so who knows???,I had a severe manic episode 4 months ago that was brought on by taking an antidepressant and other external factors.It was the perfect storm_as my doctor tells it.I don't think anything that severe would have happened otherwise.That is how I was finally correctly diagnosted with bipolar_but I put my kids and myself in danger during this one & only episode so obviously I wish my bipolar disorder could have been discovered another way.I have been incorrectly diagnosed with depression for 20 yrs with no results from meds but was still never screened for bipolar disorder.Anyone who can relate to this_please ask your doctor to screen you for bipolar disease.Taking antidepessents on there own can be detrimental_ as I have personally experienced.I am taking 600mg a day & I feel like I am taking way too much.I think he is being over cautious(because of the extreme episode &/or my family history).I believe the overdoseage is causing me unnecessary side effects_insomnia & the fatigue that follows_etc.Since the episode_ I've taken other meds.Zyprexa is one_it made me gain 20lbs.Of course I was grad. increased to the 600mg Lamotrigine and he plans to reduce it eventually but not soon enough for me.Has anyone else ever been prescribed 600mg/day even for a short period?,F,40,4  months300mg 2X D,12/9/2011Email,Lamotrigine

6, 5, BiPolar 1/Personality disorder,The only side effect I had was the acne_ but I was able to remedy that with LOTS of water (68-70oz a day) and Mary Kay Blemish Toner and Mary Kay Acne Treatment Gel.,I have always had beautiful skin without any effort_ so the acne really bothered me.  But this pill has done such wonders for me that I didn't want to abandon it.  Especially since it has not effected my weight.  When I first started using the Mary Kay products I used the toner 3x a day and applied the acne gel after.  I was able to get rid of a blemish after only 2 days of using the Mary Kay.  I do not sell Mary Kay_ I am only giving this information for those who might have the same experience.  This drug has helped me tremendously and would try anything to KEEp taking it.,F,38,3  months200 1X D,7/10/2010Email,Lamotrigine
