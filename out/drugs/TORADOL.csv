I had enough time to check out before it began feeling like the injections site was on fire. It felt like the pain lasted hours when it really only lasted 30 minutes at the most.,I have had severe migraines since I was in probably in jr high. I've been through several drugs and the only thing that wass helping was the acutal cause. I went in to see the dr and he convinced me to try a toradol shot.

It did take about 10 minutes for the Toradol to start to work but when it kicked in it eliminated 90% of the pain.  No side effects at all.  This drug is excellent for pain relief.  Was given a subcutaneous shot of Dilaudid 2 mg prior to discharge home and that_ along with the Toradol (which I was told is longer acting than the Dilaudid_) kept me comfortable until I made it to the Urologist the next morning.

Having given birth twice in my life I can say that passing a kidney stone is by far worse.  The pain just doesn't let up.  The doctor prescibed me T3's when the pain is bad but on a couple of occasions the pain was just to severe and the T3's just didn't help I had to go to the hospital for help with the pain.  After being admitted I felt like a crazy wild injured animal_ the pain was unbearable.  Once they injected me with this beautiful drug I was literally pain free in 15 minutes.  OMG...is this drug amazing.  Of course they also administered gravol for the nausea and some demoral (not sure why) but all I can say is Thank YOU makers of Toradol.,F,47, ?? 1X AN,2/20/2011,Toradol

I went home_ laid down on the bed_ and fell asleep until almost the same time_ the next day_ save a short period of wakefulness after the first 10 hours of sleep_ or so.  The medication did definitely help_ though; I've had some moderate eye pain_ a little sensitivity to light & sound_ but overall_ I feel about a million times better.

My girlfriend almost took me to the ER_ not by my request--I was too out of it--she just saw that I wasn't right.  Worst passed in a couple of hours though.,"Several days after pretty extensive knee surgery_ my knee was really swollen and causing throbbing pain.  It was the 4th of July weekend_ my Doctor's office was closed_ so I went to the ER to get it drained and to get more pain medication (this was the third similar operation on the knee_ so this was nothing new).  The ER Doctor drained the knee OK.  But rather than giving me percodan or vicodan -- the pain medicine my Doctor had prescribed  on both prior operations and this one and which worked fine and didn't have any significant side effects-- the ER Doctor gave me a shot of Toradol (to ""load"" me) and Toradol pills. This was around noon.  I took the pills as directed--basically closely following the shot.  By late afternoon-- 4-5pm_ I was really messed up.  I've had a lot of different anti-inflammatory medications for my knees and as well as several pain medications (percodan_ vicodan_ darvoset_ etc.).  Never had any significant side effects_ except the expected drowsiness etc. from the pain medication.  Whenever I am asked about drug allergies_ I put down Toradol.

Toradol injections have always knocked the spasms down from a 10 to a 4-6 within an hour or two.  Percocet and Soma usually take care of the rest_ but NOTHING has knocked down the pain and inflammation as quickly as Toradol.  Not experiencing any side-effects from it is a plus_ too.,M,36,12  times,6/9/2009Email,Toradol
204, 5, Thoracic surgery for collapsed lung,None? I got really sweaty but I think that was the morphine,This was the greatest.  In the recovery room after the surgery they gave me 40 mg (I think_ massive amounts of pain = hard to concentrate) of morphine and couldn't give me any more.  That got me down from a ten to a... 7 maybe.  Two shots of toradol got me down to a 2.  Thank you toradol!! :),M,16,2  days,5/21/2009Email,Toradol
205, 5, migrane headaches/stress/tension,none_if maybe tired but they tell you_ after you get this shot lie dowm_ in a quite_ dark room.. wich i fall a sleep,its great when all else fails_ like the motrins_ tylonal_tension relive haedaches didnt_ we tried the shot of torodol.. it worked... so a factor of why you took the shot is probly a reson of your side effect_ i went and reduced all stress by 62% and i feel better_ not great but better_ less frquent_ and can do more. she also did some other checking before she gave me the Torodol_ blood work_ and then she asked if i we depressed. so may be if you too this and you were/ are depressed_ or you took it becuse of stress_ and your wondering why it came back_ the awnsers are right in front of you stress is a major factor of MIGRANE_ as soon as i have tryed all migrane tension headache and all else false i go to the doc. usully in a 24 hrs.,F,28,3  years,4/23/2009,Toradol

208, 5, recurrent severe kidney stone pain,Minor burning during injection and persistent soreness at injection site up to 72 hrs. This can be avoided if injected 1ml/1ml with Marcaine; a local anesthetic.,[These comments are regarding Toradol  for injection_ I have not personally found Toradol tablets to be effective for pain relief.]I first encountered Toradol years ago when hospitalized with my first migraine_ 1 injection and the migraine was miraculously gone. Fast forward 20 years to 2009 and I am rushed to the ER with 10/10 flank pain_ which turns out to be a kidney stone. Again I am given Toradol and the pain is almost gone within seconds. I am currently producing kidney stones like some sort of masochistic factory & both the ER and my urologist are very generous in offerring me Norco_ Vocodin and Oxycodone. But I far prefer_ and always request 30mg/ml Toradol for self injection. (Note: I am VERY needle phobic_ that's how bad my pain is and how well this medication works when injected). It is the only thing that actually rids me of all the pain and leaves me functional so that I can still work and drive. It IS a drug with many side effects and must be taken under the close management of a physician. However_ for those people whom are good candidates for it_ like myself_ it it a absolute godsend. My quality of life would be zero right now without it.,F,43,6  months,3/31/2009,Toradol

My husband found the student Dr. and told her and she came in with a large dose of benedryl and did not know why I didnt get it this time. This helped a great deal. the Dr. said that she always gives benadryl with toradol because of side effects. I do have asthma and do take celexa. ,I do have asthma and do take celexa. These are just two of the interactions that should be considered before administrating toradol.I had also been give zofran before the toradol that day.

I was given more every 6 hours for several days.  It also took away my nerve damage pain for about a week.

I was on it for less than 2 days. I can tell a difference since my last dose was about 12 hours ago_ the side effects seem to have eased up a little but unfortuantely the pain is becoming much more obvious.

I was given Maxalt (a disolvable form of Imitrex)_ which made me sick and therefore made my headache much worse. So I went to see my regular DR she gave me a shot of phenogren for the headache and a shot of another drug for the nausea. Well_ needless to say because phenogren affects the nerves it did me no good. Four days later because I still could not get rid of my 'migraine'_ I went to see another DR who gave me a shot of Toradol (a muscle relaxant). He told me that the pain was more than likely caused due to the muscles in my head contracting and spasming and not relaxing. He said I should feel the affects within 20 min. Unfortunately_ I was not feeling any relief until I woke up from a 5 hour nap. I still had a little pain_ but it was bearable_ and I was happy.,F,20,1  days,12/5/2007,Toradol

I am allergic to opiates/opioids (as well as having other allergies and asthma) and several other medications_ so I assumed my treatment options were limited. My migraines are menstrual-linked_ and I ususally have them all during the week before I start my period.

I was given a script of 20 pills for 10mg of Toradol by an ER doctor and with 30 mins of taking ONE_ I was pain free for 12 hours!!  Only 10mg of Toradol 2 times a day and I can breath!  Tramadol comes close but doesn't last as long nor act as quick.  Just wanted other women to know about this miracle drug!,F,36,3  days,2/21/2006Email,Toradol
258, 4, Back and Leg Pain from my Back,When I would urinate I think I was finished before I was finished. I dont know if that side effect came from the shot_ but it was right after I got the shot.,I have had 4 shots over the past 8 months. I felt no immediate relief with the shit. It took about 3 days to take effect. Then_ it would only last about 7 days after I got the shot. Just like clock work the pain is back. When I get a lot of pain in my lower back I get leg pain in both legs. I hope to have surgery soon to correct the problem_ but toradol really helps; for a week or so.,M,36,8  months,2/14/2006,Toradol
259, 3, Migraine,Stomach cramps with the feeling of diarrhea_ but was constipated,I had had a migraine for 8 days. I was taking two other pain medications as prescribed by my doctor 4 pills 4 times per day. It made me sleep_ but when I awoke_ the pain was back. I could not take another day of it. I visited my doctor and was given an injection of Toradol.  The dizziness_ nausea_ blurred vision_ and the headache was gone within 10 minutes. It was wonderful. The next day it was back.  I am at a loss.  I am now on day eleven of the migraine. It is not as bad as it was_ but I am still looking for total relief.,F,29,1  days,2/5/2006,Toradol
260, 5, Surgery_ other,I cannot take Morphine or Demerol (found out the hard way)_ so this was my only other alternative. It very works well_ but not as well as the other two described above as it wears off earlier.,The only concern I have is that prolonged use can lead to kidney damage which was why I was taking it in the first place. As long as amount and duration is monitered_ I would highly recommend Toradol.,F,28, ,2/3/2006,Toradol
261, 1, Sever back pain,Sever vomiting of blood_chest pain_chills,Was given injection of toradol in er because i was in severe pain. i have three buldging disc in my back and had lost all feeling in my right arm and leg.Soon after I broke out in a cold sweat and became very nauseated_after going home I began throwing up blood perfusly and was taken to the emergency room were I stayed over night.I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG AGAIN!!!!,F,39,1  times,1/19/2006Email,Toradol
262, 1, Inflammatory cartilage pain,"Felt like I was ""high"" - things didn't make sense to me_ I was lifting my feet several feet in the air while walking_ etc. Just completely ""out of it.""","Given as a shot to ease inflammatory cartilage pain (in addition to prescriptions to many other NSAIDs). Later found out through my own research that the NSAIDs actually further damage the cartilage. Sure_ Toradol eased my pain for about three hours_ but that was it. Never again! I'm on herbal anti-inflammatories now and feel ""normal"" again and my pain level continues to decrease!",F,28,1  days,9/17/2005,Toradol
263, 1, Headache Relief,Dizziness_ Red & Itchy Skin_ Fever_ Drowsiness_ Flushing_ Nervousness,Doesn't relieve the headaches for more than 2 hours.,F,18,6  days,9/5/2005Email,Toradol
264, 2, migriane,dizziness_ sweating_ and loose stools,was not happy with results_ I felt worse after the administration of toradol then I did before,F,25,1  days,7/11/2005,Toradol
265, 2, neck and shoulder pain,the injection itself (IM) was fine.  of course there was a bit of pain due to pushing a liquid into the muscle tissue_ but it was slight.  at first_ it really worked for me_ but about two hours after the shot_ i began to have severe abdominal cramping and intense burning pains.  i began vomitting a few hours after and had incredible pain.  i doubt i'll take it again_ as the only thing that helped the pain was hydrocodone_ which is what i was trying NOT to take.  ce la vie!,,M,34,1  days,6/22/2005,Toradol
266, 5, migraine oral and IM,2 doses of oral in a day_ bloody nose the next.  IM--sweet relief--no side effects either.,With all other drugs pushed at me and I refused_ my NP offered me this.  My migraines are gone totally within 1 hour without sleepiness_ hangover_ etc.  Go home_ lay on couch_ chair etc. and in a short time it is gone. I saw a neuro as well as my rheumy and they have both endorsed the medication for me.  I have FMS/CFS as well and by not taking care of the body/muscle pain_ it can lead to the migraine out of control.  I know my limits of no more than twice of oral 30 mg in a day_ then call for the hypo which is 60 mg.   My medication insurance will not allow me to get more than 6 doses in a month of the oral.  Yet they cover endless in the ER_ different insurance for that care.,F,50,5  years,5/26/2005Email,Toradol
267, 5, major surgery,none,I was given morphene with the button and it did not touch my pain I was begging for relief and then came a shot of toradol and within minutes the pain was gone all of it wow. nothing better as far as im concerned.,F,40,14  days,4/25/2005,Toradol

273, 4, headaches,none noticed,I started taking it after visiting the Diamond headache clinic in Chicago. I wasn't delighted with the thought of stabbing myself with a needle_ but after practicing on a orange_ I had the confidence to try. When I had my next bout with a killer headache I had no problem utilizing the shot of toradol. Funny what pain will do to a person. toradol has been one of the few consistant reliefs for my pain. Havn't had a script in a while but still would use.,M,43,9  months,1/20/2003,Toradol
274, 5, muscle spasms_chronic  pain,Drowsiness.,"My Mom took it for years but now they're finding it can do bad organ damage real fast_ so she can't take it anymore. I recommend it to chronic neck and back pain sufferers who visit the ER like a second home as a ""pain cocktail"". Ask for a shot of demerol_ toradol and visterol.  It will give relief within 20min. depending on dosage and body weight of course. Don't feel bad about telling the doctor what you want_ he/she's not a mind reader. Just don't EVER take a prescription for pain pills from an ER doctor_ that's how you get flagged in the computer as a drug seeker_ go see your doctor for your meds.",F,21,5  times,8/13/2002Email,Toradol
