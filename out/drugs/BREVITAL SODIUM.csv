0, 5, Outpatient ECT,No side effects for me.  Was up and about within about 45 minutes after the procedure.  Not drowsy later or nauseous or anything.  In fact I went to work right afterwards.,Not used very much since Propofol came about.  But as I understand it_ the Methohexital does not interfere as much with the seizure as Propofol does_ so it is preferred for this procedure.,M,40,10  weeks,9/22/2008,Brevital sodium
