1, 2, Endometrial cancer,I had no periods for three months after I started Megace and then they were irregular with occasional spotting (My periods were perfectly ordered before). No appetite change or weight gain. Mood changes_ dizziness.,My fibroids started to grew very fast and my gyno said it is because of progestin intake.

2, 5, To aid in weight gain,I have had no side effects from this medication as to date.  Although I must mention I am on the liquid and it tastes absolutely disgusting.  Small price to pay to be healthy again however.  I have found that a potted meat sandwich is the best food to take with this medication.  It quickly removes the disgusting taste from your mouth and you can't go wrong with a few calories in your diet if your tying to gain weight anyhow right?  I have been on this medication for 7 days now and have gained a total of 6.4 pounds.  I was almost 30 lbs under weight so I still have a long road ahead of me but I'm off to a great state.  This is the first medication I have been given that actually helps.  I've tried everything herbal under the sun_ been to dietitians_ counted calories and ate like a pig.  This is my motive drug!,,F,34,7  days650,12/16/2015Email,Megace

Also_ the first dose I took made me feel drunk and I had short term memory issues for about 3 hours_ but it faded away.,I gained about 3 pounds (if not more) per week! This was much needed after losing 10 pounds in 2 months from eosinophilic esophagitis closing off my throat and making it so hard to get enough calories in plus reduced appetite from the stress of that. I was only 95 pounds before that happened! This drug_ even with its slightly annoying side effects_ has absolutely saved me from a hospital stay and NG tube. I'm not a big fan of western meds_ but it has made me look/feel healthier and energetic and so quickly.

16, 3, Extensive Complex Hyperplasia Atypi,Loss of sex drive_increased appetite which caused weight gain_ increased blood preasure_ cramps in my calves_ bad night sweats and hot flashes.  Mood swings which alter every day living and fatigueness.,Had Extensive Complex Hyperplasia Atypical and a hysterectomy was not an option for me as I wanted to have a child. Doctors would have preferred to do one but I fought it. I was on aggressive Provera and Prometrium therapy before Megace but needed to get something stronger to reverse the condition before I could try for a child.  Megace altered my life so much I had to work from home once a week b/c things would really get to me and I would be VERY fatigue by mid week.  Gained 30 lbs in 3 months and when I tried to work out the fatigueness increased.  Am going back on Provera @ 40 mg 2x a day which is still aggressive but I am at the end of the conidition and hopefully only need 1 more D&C to test. Next month will be 1 yr since I started aggressive progesterone therapy.  I would have a good discussion with your doctor about this med if this is what is recommended. If I didn't want a child so bad I would have told them to do a hysterectomy b/c this med ruined my quality of life.,,31,6  months160 2X D,6/9/2011,Megace
17, 5, Appetite Loss,Megace works wonderfully.  I have not experienced any side effects besides sweating (only at night) and more frequent urination.  It has brought my appetite back and I have gained 8 pounds in 3 weeks.  Great drug!,,F,27,3  weeks625 1X D,5/25/2011,Megace

In two months_ I gained thirty pounds and have never been happier with my self-image in my life.  This was the miracle drug I had been waiting for for years and while the side effects were annoying at worst_ they were well worth the advantages.",M,19,2  months1 tsp 1X D,6/7/2010,Megace
19, 2, fibroids,Weight gain and developed diabetes. Hair loss and breast reduction.,I would not take this if you are already overweight. I think it may result in subsequently developing diabetes and it did not shrink my fibroids.  They grew! It did diminish the bleeding problem associated with the fibroids_ but it wasn't worth getting the new problems that developed.,F,53,18  months30 MG 1X D,2/18/2010,Megace

But the side effects have slowed me up terribly and are rough.,F,61,2  years,11/15/2008,Megace
24, 4, Atypical hyperplasia,Side-effects change from month to month.  The first noticeable side effects were increased appetite and frequent urination.  I started dieting and have lost about 20 lbs.  Soon started noticing that I had trouble falling asleep and then sleep interruption (had to get up during the night to urinate).  I also get a lot of headaches_ gas_ pain in stomach and back_ loss of sex drive_ mood swings_ loss of concentration_ fatigue_ tiredness and most recently pain in calf. There is some bleeding_ but not like having a period.  Haven't had a period since I've been on the medication.,This medication works.

Within 3 days of starting this regimen_ it stopped the bleeding_ cold.  No bleeding_ no spotting_ nothing!  I'm probably still looking at a hysterectomy due to the adenomyosis_ but I hope to stay on this med until then.,F,45,20  days,7/22/2008,Megace
27, 1, Heavy menstrual bleeding,Gynecologist prescribed it for heavy periods due to fibroids.  Stopped the bleeding cold_ but four days later I got a blood clot that led to a pulmonary embolism and almost killed me.,If you have any blood clotting disorders (I have Factor V Leiden) do not take this drug under any circumstances.  I also think any doctor who prescribes it should do a comprehensive blood test for clotting disorders first.  In my case_ my gyno knew about my clotting disorder and prescribed it anyway.  The blood clot risk is in the literature but I found it before he did.,F,49,5  days,5/4/2008,Megace
28, 4, Stomach cancer,Increased appetite and increase need for liquid fluids.,I was diagnosed in February 2007 with stage 4 stomach cancer.  After 6 months of chemo all malignant cells were destroyed_ however the main tumor mass with malignant cells remain.  I have completed 5 weeks of radiation on the tumor which destroyed my appetite.  Megace has increased my appetite and a need for fluids which is very important.  I have only taken megace for two weeks_ hopefully I will gain the 45 lbs back that I loss during treatment.  I will get back to you in a couple of months.,F,56,2  weeks,3/19/2008Email,Megace

31, 4, For weight gain for Celiac Disease,Really bad fatugue_ tingling sensation in neck and mouth_ ankle and leg water retention. Gained 14 pounds in 3 weeks which was amazing but_ side effects which over ride the outcome. Feeling like I am crashing all the time and metal taste in mouth_it also caused me to not have a menstal cycle.,I think the drug is worth taking due to my situation of malabsorbtion and lack of gaining weight. But_ the side effects really take over. There is also no way you can get pregnant on this medication if you are young consider this because it can cause deformities in sexual organs of fetus's this can be really hard to deal with so make sure you are not planning on getting pregnant.,F,27,1  months,1/9/2008Email,Megace
32, 5, complex atypical hyperplasia,There has been an increase in side effects each month as the 5 months have passed (only 2 more months to go!): moodiness_ calf tension/pain_ ankle swelling/fluid retention_ mild weight gain_ frequent urination (even when bladder is nearly empty) which also results in frequent sleep disruption due to waking every 1-2 hours_ extreme fatigue (beyond what is accounted for by sleep disruption)_ mild hypertension_ increased thirst_ occasional headaches/body aches_ occasional diarhea often combined with mild viral-like symptoms (i.e. hot flushes and exhaustion)_ increased appetite.,My biopsy at 3 months was clean and I am hopeful for my follow-up biopsy in 2 months.  The side effects are worth it because it is looking like I will be able to avoid both cancer and a hysterectomy.  I am glad my gynecologist recommended this approach even with the side effects (the side effects weren't bad for the first 1-2 months).  With diet_ I have managed only a 5 lb. weight gain over the last 2 months only.  It is my hope to stop this gain and possibly reverse it before my next M.D. appointment.,F,37,5  months,6/4/2007,Megace
