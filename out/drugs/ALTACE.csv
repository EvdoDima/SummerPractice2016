I felt better within a day_ but it took several days for my face to return to normal.,Altace was prescribed to lower my BP and protect my heart and kidneys_ and my doctor didn't think this was a side effect of altace.

I do agree with the following person about doctors being to lazy to find the underlying reason for high BP! I do smoke 1 pack a day so the doctor assumes this is the problem with no other testings. I am sure this is not helping my high BP but for being a constrution worker and in good shape I beleive there is another reason. My BP was at average 151 over 91.

51, 4, High Blood Pressure,Further update to my last post on 9/17/2008.I decided to stick with the Tritace. The fatigue has largely gone (they say that this is common when you first start any high blood pressure medication). I was going to try Norvasc_ but heard too many bad reports about legs swelling etc. Going to see if the libido improves now that the fatigue is gone.Sticking with Tritace for now. BP seems to be under control on just 2.5 mg.,If you dont have a bad cough then stick with this drug as the fatigue will improve over time. The doc can always start you on a smaller dose and slowly work your way up.I am on 2.5 mg but might have been better for me to start on the 1.25 mg in the first couple of months.,F,31,15  months,9/29/2008,Altace
52, 3, High Blood Pressure,Dosage 2.5 mg commenced to treat high blood pressure. In the first month noticed the following: occasional cough (but not enough to stop the drug)_ very dry throat on a couple days_ reduced libido_ considerable fatigue - couldn't seem to keep my eyes open past 9-10pm when ordinarily I required very little sleep. Due to the tiredness_ results in snoring on occasion.After a little time_ things seemed to settle down - I no longer had the cough_ didnt experience a dry throat_ my body adapted to the fatigue and I can now keep awake past 9pm :)Next steps: am going to try a new drug as the libido has only improved slightly. Was going to consider halving the dose but Doc has suggested that I try NORVASC for a few weeks to see how this goes (fingers crossed).,The brand used was Tritace (Ramipril) which is the same drug as Altace.,F,31,15  months,9/17/2008,Altace

58, 2, M.I. AGE 27 / LOW EF,I would first get a slight headache if I were to forget to take this med. Then about a year ago I started to get a slight twitch around my left eye and it just got worse. I went to a neurologist_ my medical doctor neither could figure it out. I noticed it got really bad about an hour after taking my heart medications. I stopped one while taking the others and I noticed when I stopped the Altace the muscle cramps and twitching went away.,I have to go to my Cardiologist to let them know what the symptoms I had been experiencing with this medication. I had been taking Altace for about 6 - 7 years before these symptoms started to show up.,M,39,7  years,5/4/2008Email,Altace

66, 4, BP,A dry cough that started about 5 weeks ago_ and has continued day and night since then.  BP was lowered for 1.5 years.  I had no adverse symptoms until cough recently developed.,Initially I thought the cough was due to cold and flu_ but it wasn't productive.  When headaches started and raw throat developed from chronic cough_ I went back to my MD.  He immediately took me off Altace and switched me to different BP medication.  Told me it would be a few days_ maybe weeks before cough went away.,M,55,1.5  years,2/24/2008,Altace

69, 4, chronic high blood pressure,only at first - constant extreme dizziness_ felt like I might just slide off the chair_(DO NOT TAKE ALTACE w/a diuretic) now only lightheadedness_ slight but daily.  I drink too much coffee to offset the brain fog. Fingers occasionally become numb/green-grayish and hurt_ especially in cold weather-circulation problem  maybe. BP was around 185/50_ now always very near 120/80. Most slight changes were managed by just keeping busy and not worrying about the minor discomforts. Once I ran out of Altace and BP shot up and I felt extremely anxious/tense and very tightly wrapped-it was awful-never again.,New Doctor/Cardiologist says keep it up - 10 mg per day. Also just started taking 5 mg Crestor and baby aspirin. I would recommend Altace. Only side effects I feel now after 10 years is a slight brain fog and occasional sore-numb fingers. Stay as active as you can-move_ move_ move-that really helps combat the brain fog. Brisk walking a few times a day is easy and works.,F,54,10  years,2/13/2008,Altace

Snoring at night due to very dry throat and this wakes me up 4 or more times a night. Can't make it through the day because of tiredness. Experienced a period of high anxiety and was placed on an SSRI and of course this led to even more side effects such as decreased sexual function and libido. As one writer said_ the joy almost went out of life. I need to review my lifestyle and get of the meds.,Now taking up to 40mg per day and BP is really not much improved. I have been steadily suffering ongoing and increasing major fatigue which has impacted my social and professional life very badly. Motivation levels for all things pleasure almost gone. Just too tired to get up and go. I started to search the www and found this page. Wow_ could this med be part of the problem?My wife is also on same meds and she is so tired she spends 15 hours a day in bed_ gained 30lb and has worsened menopause symptoms. She has dry cough all night and major joint and muscel problems. So_ OK_ it could be old age (57 for both of us) but why don;t the Dr's tell us about these issues when they prescribe this stuff. Perhaps the free golf trips they get_ makes them overlook these facts. I also believe it should be everyones business to be their own doctors and to own their own health problems.

It started with a constant tickling of the throat_ like I was starting to get a cold. Then_ almost suddenly_ I started getting the infamous dry hacking cough.

A bit of dizziness at first that went away after 2 weeks.,I stupidly told my Dr about the cough and he immediately put me on Coversyl_ then 3 other meds until I got to Diovan 160 which was the absolute worst med ever - stomach problems_ dizziness_ nausea_ hair thinning and weight gain (gained back the 10 lbs).

100, 3, cardiomyopathy - 45% efficiency,I take 5 mg Altace daily_ but no other drugs except Advil or aspirin several pills per week.  Resting heart rate is in the low 50's_ about 120/80.  I do not have hypertension.  Fatigue seems to be the worst side effect for me.  Cramps in feet and calf muscles_ usually while laying down or bike riding.  Cramps in abdominal muscles.  Fatigue and lack of energy in general_ but worst in the evening_ made worse by relaxing on couch right after work - very hard to summon the desire to get up - but if I get up and get strenuous exercise for an hour or more I feel MUCH BETTER for the rest of the evening and the next day (note: I have always been a physically active person - a sedentary type person might not get this benefit). However_ I can't seem to maintain the same intensity of workout than before taking Altace - this is due in large part to my Cardiomyopathy_ but I feel it is worsened by the Altace.  Often get light-headed when bending over at the waist.  Bouts with diarhea for several wee,I get 4 or 5 hours of fairly strenuous exercise per week_ in blocks of 1- to 2-hour workouts_ which I have found to improve my tolerance of Altace by staving off the fatigue (the worst side effect for me).  Light to moderate exercise offers no benefit and is a waste of time for me.  Overall_ the side effects of Altace are annoying_ but not to bad at this point for me and are worth bearing if Altace will really prevent my condition from worsening.,M,42,2  years,6/30/2007,Altace

Spoke to a pharmacist as I was out of the country who immediately asked if I was taking an ACE inhibitor then suggested that it was a probable cause.  Stopped taking it for 3 days and the sore throat_ cold and cough went.  Started taking it again and the sore throat and cough returned within 24 hours.  Stopped taking it for 10 days and only cough maybe 3 or 4 times a day.

178, 1, High blood pressure,Cough- got progressively worse_ especially at night. I lost many nights of sleep. It was frightening.,I was not warned about the cough side effect. I thought I must have lung cancer from when I smoked 20 years ago. I stopped Altace about a month ago on my doctor's orders and the cough has nearly gone. Since stopping it_ my blood pressure has been around 130_ which not too bad.,M,71,2  months,9/4/2005Email,Altace

180, 5, high bp,I started having a cough during the day and night but I went for allergy testing first to rule it out and it turned out I am allergic to dust.

185, 4, High Blood pressure,Decrease sex drive is a big one especially since I am only 36 yrs old.  The other main one that I have noticed is that I had let my prescription run out by accident and had to wait on the mail order script to get here during this time off of the medication not only did I have more erections than I had had over the last 12 months in the 5 days I have been off of Altace but I had developed chronic knee pain over the last year or so while taking Altace my doctor said it was just arthritis setting in but during this time of being off of the medication my knees actually started feeling better and not hurting as they have over the last 12 months or so.  Clearly there is a connection between not only the Sexual drive with this medication but also the severe knee pain I have been suffering with.  Needless to say I am not starting the Altace back up as I am going back to my doctor to demand something different for my High Blood pressure that hopefully does not have these kind of side effects.  Good luck to all of you that are still on it and hopefully you will not experience the same side effects I have.,It does work on lowering your blood pressure but the side effects are just too much to ignore.,M,36,16  months,6/14/2005Email,Altace

188, 4, High BP (150/90),At 10 mg dose had itchy rash on backs of knees_ and hair loss (head_ arms_ legs).  The rash became evident after taking Altace for approximately 2 weeks.  After 6 weeks I realized that the hair on my head was starting to fall out_ and I had lost most of the hair off of my arms and legs.  On the bright side_ I didn't have to shave as often!  After decreasing dosage to 5 mg daily these side effects seem to have gone away.  Rash has disappeared_ and hair is thickening again.,Started Altace at 5 mg daily_ which lowered BP to around 140/80.  Increased dosage to 10 mg_ which lowered BP to around 135/80.  However the side effects kicked in.  Doc reduced dosage and problems went away.  By itself Altace doesn't totally control my BP.  Must take it in combination with something else.  Combining with 10 mg HCTZ was VERY effective.  Reduced BP to 110/70.  Currently taking with Norvasc_ with BP lowering to only around 130/80.,M,41,7  weeks,6/7/2005,Altace
