0, 1, Anxiety,Extreme fatigue_ arrythmia_ palpitations_ shortness of breath_ depression_ worsening anxiety_ disorientation_ general malaise,At first this medication worked wonderfully for anxiety. Slowly I began developing the above side effects and had to go to the emergency room with a resting heart rate of 120 and constant palpitations. I didn't realize it was the clonodine for a long time. I was taking more and more of the medicine that was making me sick.,M,35,2  months.01 2x day,5/15/2016,Catapres

2, 1, Hypertension,Stay away from this drug! It worsened my Blood Pressure over time_ and has too many horrible side effects to mention!Creates insane anxiety!,It is a killer drug!

3, 1, High pulse,Discontinuation syndrome/ withdrawal,Developed high blood pressure since being on this. Doesnt even help with my fast heart rate anymore. I have to take it to avoid withdrawing from it and having a stroke. Last time i tried weaning i was in the hospital with A-FIB and sinus tachycardia. I think I will forever be STUCK in this drug. Stay away from it unless you want to be in ICU. This is by far THE hardest pill to come off of and I  really don't think it's possible without killing you. If you just started taking it_ talk to your doc about stopping before its too late. How is there not a class action lawsuit for this drug??,F,31,4  years2.4 mgs,10/8/2015,Catapres
4, 1, Hypertension,Lethargy_ foggy brain_ unable to focus_ palpitations_ extremely dry mouth_ nosebleeds_ loss of appetite_ low pulse/bradycardia (,I have resistant hypertension and it also fluctuates a great deal.  So in the morning I can be 120/80_ at lunch be 173/108 and by bedtime 114/79.  My doc has me on 3 different meds_ metoprolol (beta blocker)_ trandolopril (ACE inhibitor) and then D/C'd Cardura and replaced it with Clonidine.  I only took this devil of a medication for 5 days and spent a lot of time researching the side effects during those 5 days.  I would NEVER recommend Clonidine to anyone.  The side effects started on day 1 within 45 minutes of taking the medication.  My mouth was dry I was drinking 2 gallons of water every day and still was thirsty_ and of course because my mouth was so dry_ food had no taste to me what-so-ever.  I was lethargic and felt like I could fall asleep at any given time during the day which is NOT a good thing when you work.  I was unable to focus on anything and forgot my computer passwords and was even on the phone several times and forgot who I was talking to and why I was talking to them.  By day 4 I started having palpitations and my blood pressure was still elevated but my pulse was really low_ borderline bradycardia.  I had a headache from day one and also had some tremors.  I stopped taking it and contacted my physician to let him know why.  There was no way I could function day to day feeling like that.,F,56,5  days.02 MG 2X D,5/28/2015,Catapres

Hospitalized with heart and kidney failure.,I have severe hypertension without medication to levels over 200/150_ so this drug was combined with three other anti-hypertensive drugs and a diuretic. [Verapamil_ Bystolic_Amlodipine_ Triam/HCTZ].  I took Catapres on a as needed basis when my BP was severely high.  It took about 24 hours for my BP to get to a normal level_ but shortly got dangerously low.

16, 2, Sweating/Blood Pressure/Anxiety,Dizziness_ Noticable Hair Loss_ Severe Constipation_ Occasional Palpitations_ Tiredness_ Malaise_ Weight Gain_ Extreme Dry Skin_ Uncontrollable Dandruff_ to name a few.,I started taking Clonidine (Catapres) about 2 years ago initially at one 0.1 mg tablet per day for sweating due to Methadone Maintenance Therapy's notorious sweating problems. At first_ I didn't like the drug because of the dizziness I experienced and chose to stop taking it briefly. I started on it again to give it another shot and still had the dizziness although it went away about a month into taking the drug. For awhile_ it was a wonder drug.  My sweating episodes decreased and it helped with my unrelenting anxiety.  My doctor put me on a sedative drug for  a week in the beginning of treatment for the anxiety but discontinued it after the first and only prescription because I guess he didn't want me to form another addiction.  So_ I stayed on the Clonidine_ and he increased the dosage to 0.1 mg tablets three times a day.  I was on that dose for a good portion of my treatment__ I did notice that I was taking more naps than usual and was so tired I could barely get through a 6 hour day at school without falling asleep at my desk. After about 6 months of that my anxiety increased and my doctor in turn increased my dose again to two 0.1 mg tablets_  three time a day. So by this time I was sleeping all the time_ no energy. Then about 1 1/2 years into taking Clonidine_ I started noticing more than usual hair loss in my brush. I wasn't worried at first_ but then it started to fall out more and more.

Works great for a few months then it does nothing but keep your BP low. I'm finally at .5mg's_ 2X's/day and still have real bad constipation. Add this with opiates_ (which cause bad constipation)_ and you get nothing but an impacted colon. Even the pharmacist asked why I was on the most extreme high BP med out there. I wish I would have done research on this because I would have stayed away from it. Do not take this while you are detoxing_ take it when you are finally off your DOC. When my dr. put me up to .2mg's_ 3 x's/day_ I couldn't understand why I couldn't change the channel on my t.v..

I felt 100% better until one evening I had to go to the ER room because my BP had gone up suddenly (210/110).  I was put on the 3mg patch then and only tolerated it for 4 days.  I had to get off the patch because I just couldn't tolerate the itching any more.  I am now on tablets and so far (1 week) I've had only minor side effects (light dizzeness_ etc.).  Overall this drug has worked for me in keeping my BP lowered.,M,63,1  years,8/7/2006Email,Catapres
52, 1, blood pressure,I get hives in the back of my throat with nagging cough within 10 minutes of taking a catapres pill.  Then fatigue hits so overwhelming it can be difficult to focus.I gained weight on this medicine.There are several classes of blood pressure medicines I cannot take.  Hytrin sent me to the emergency room looking like Garfield the cat.  That was scary.  The emergency room doctor lowered my blood pressure with catapres.  Then my family doctor kept writing scrips for the medicine even though it never adequately controlled my blood pressure.Just before it is time to take a does of catapres_ my blood pressure spikes.  My doctor took me off of the catapres and put me on benicor which put me in the emergency room.  The doctor said NEVER ABRUPTLY STOP TAKING CATAPRES.  Your pressure will rebound spike.  It is a withdrawal symptom.I decided to go to a heart doctor who is weaning me off of catapress instead of relying on my family doctor to lower my blood pressure.,Why are they selling a blood pressure pill that actually raises your blood pressure just before it is time to take your next pill?,F,51,5  months,7/27/2006,Catapres
53, 1, High BP,I LOVED the idea of a once a week patch! Less to remember_ steady dosage of drug. And it worked great for the first two years! But now I have developed severe itching and pustules at site of patch. I have to keep switching the site of the patch. I took a break of several months from the patch_ then returned to it two months ago. Now_ in addition to the pustules and itchiness under the patch_ I have also developed itchy scalp and unbearable itching on my earlobes_ esp. the left one (I wear the patch on my left arm). I am off it_ permanently. I will not use it again.,I have read that switching to Clonidine pills after developing an allergy to the patch could trigger a whole body allergic reaction.,F,59,3  years,7/5/2006,Catapres
54, 5, Blood Pressure Surges/High BP,I first took clonidine/catapres for uncontrolled blood pressure surges_ and it worked fantastically_ very fast control. They also used it on me in the ER. Extreme tiredness is a side effect---this caused me to take 1/4 to 1/2 tab of .1mg on a regular basis_ and it still works perfectly.  BUT_ YOU MUST NOT CONSUME ANY ALCOHOL WITH CLONIDINE.  Alcohol_ even one drink_ reverses the effect of clonidine.  Moderate alcohol (a few glasses of wine for several days) will completely stop clonidine from working for 24 hours--you will need ER and a different drug to bring down BP.  Once I realized this_ I found many research papers on the alcohol effect in animals.  I now have no side effects from clonidine_ because I quit drinking.,"YOU MUST NOT CONSUME ANY ALCOHOL WITH CLONIDINE.  If you need to drink_ find a different medication.  The ""Avoid Alcohol"" warning is a joke--you can't drink at all without diminishing the effectiveness of this drug.",F,49,3  months,6/5/2006,Catapres
55, 4, Orthostatic intolerance & tourettes,Weight gain.,I've used the patch for several years with no skin problems.  I take this to raise my blood pressure_ not lower it_ and it works great for that.  It seems to help ticks some but not great.  I am searching for causes of insomnia which brought me to this site.  They say the % is low.,F,42,5  years,5/24/2006,Catapres
56, 3, Severe Hypertension,Exreme fatigue and dry mouth_ dry skin_ hair_ eyes.,Is working better than anything else I've tried in lowering BP from 160/106 to 129/89 or so_ but that fluctuates due to the short life of the drug. Don't know if I can continue to take at least during the day-I am falling asleep at my desk_ meetings_ etc. Cannot shake the pure lethargy and fatigue,F,46,6  days,5/3/2006,Catapres
57, 3, High blood pressure,At first the patch was wonderful because of the lack of side effects and the excellent control of very high blood pressure. After a couple of months on the patch_ the itching and skin rash were/are almost intolerable.  The other side effect that began thereafter three is anxiety and depression.  I wish there were another drug that could control my BP without all the side effects.   I wrote to the manufacturer in Germany without any response.  That is disappointing.,,F,66,6  months,3/30/2006Email,Catapres
58, 2, High Blood pressure,Extreme dry mouth--even though it says the drug has a half life of 6hours_ dry mouth lasts for over 24hours after discontinuation.  Fatigue.  Minimal eye dryness.  Sleepy_ not good while driving at all; very dangerous.  Dose taken 300mcg/day.  Changes in mood_ slight depression_ loss of sex drive.  This drug has the most side effects of anthying else and the list goes on.  Whoever approved this should be put to death.,"Useless drug for reducing blood pressure and should be pulled off the market.  All it does is give side effects.  I also noticed while taking this drug that I would move my arms while sleeping at night_ kinda of like sleepwalking motions.  I'd actually wake up and see myself doing that.  Once I woke up and I was sleeping in a ""muslim praying"" position.",M,,7  days,10/29/2005,Catapres
59, 2, Migraine Headaches,Elevated Blood Pressure_ weight gain_ muscle cramps_ aches and pains_ dry eyes_ change in taste_ heart palpitations - over time_ benefit for headaches ceased.,After starting Catapres_ I put on weight and my blood pressure became elevated - I thought BP elevation was due to weight gain - After I developed rash from patch and switched to oral (same dosage) -side effects were worse - slowly discontinued  medication and side effects diminished AND blood pressure returned to normal! I don't understand this!,F,60,700  days,9/19/2005,Catapres
60, 2, menopausal - hot flashes,I was on only a 0.1 mg tablet daily for about 3 months.  Now I am taking a 0.2 mg tablet daily and still find no relief of hot flashes.  I understand this is a very low dose but am apprehensive about taking the patch or a higher dose.  Doctor cautions about possible dizziness with increased doses.,Flashes are so bad_ I am willing to give this a shot for a longer time period.  So far_ I am having no side effects positive or negative.,F,56,4  months,2/26/2005,Catapres
