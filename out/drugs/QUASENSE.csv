0, 1, Birth Control and heavy periods,Moodiness and sores developing on Labia,I had BOTH my daughters on this pill and they both developed canker like sores on the Labia area at 8-9 weeks after starting this pill.....just too much of a coincidence for it to not be this pill......took them off immediately....sores were painful and not worth the aggravation.,F,16,8  weeks 1X D,5/4/2016Email,Quasense
1, 4, birth control,Is anyone experiencing sleep issues with this medication? I am having occasional nightmares with sleep walking_ infrequently_ but it is is problem. Onset at age 45 with no other precipitating causes or prescribed medications is unusual.,,F,45, .15mg/.03m 1X D,1/6/2011,Quasense
2, 3, Birth Control,Burst blood vessel_ which caused me to see flashing lights in my vision.,Prior to Quasense_ I'd been taking Seasonale_ and other birth control pills for the past 12 years_ so it's hard to say that Quasense is the only culprit_ but I started seeing spots/flashing lights out of the corner of my eye. I went to the eye doctor and he found a burst blood vessel_ which he believed to be caused from too much estrogen in the Quasense. He said if I didn't stop taking the pills_ I would likely have a stroke. He suggested that my OB/GYN might be able to recommend a different brand of pill with less estrogen_ or another form of birth control.,F,30,1  years 1X D,10/19/2010,Quasense
