9, 3, prescribed not ovulating each month,It's my first cycle taking clomid I have mild spots of endometriosis the doctor warned me I might experience abdominal pain an if it gets too bad they will book me straight in for a scan. For 2 days my stomach has been in agony it's bearable as long as I have painkillers with me at all times I can't walk much because of the pain it hurts when I cough laugh or feel about. I'm hoping it eases off as I don't want to be phoning my consultant to book me in for a scan for no reason I don't want to be wasting her time. It's been 5 days since taking them on days 2-6 of my cycle so maybe it's because I'm currently on day 22 an the pain started day 21 maybe I've ovulated fingers crossed.,,F,25,1  months50mg,10/20/2015Email,Clomid

13, 2, PCOS_ Anovulation & Absent Periods,Caused SEVERE mood swings that got way out of hand as I continued taking the drug. Clomid made me feel like I was not myself. I got into major fights with my husband over things I wouldn't have normally_ broke things I wish I hadn't_ inflicted pain on myself in a few different ways including cutting_ and had feelings of depression and wanting to die. Minor side effects I experienced were hot flashes and night sweats. The symptoms usually started a day or two after finishing the 5th pill for each cycle and lasted for up to 2-3 weeks.,"To elaborate on the ""SEVERE mood swings_"" I was so mentally messed up from this drug that I had boughts of chaotic rage towards my husband. The first month I had successfully embarrassed myself in front of all my neighbors by driving off in a fit of rage and ended up driving up onto my next door neighbors sidewalk like a crazy person; which is a good reason not to drive when angry to begin with_ but I felt I had no control over any of my actions much like The Incredible Hulk. The second month I still got into huge fights with the hubby that ended in me causing self harm due to not being able to handle the strong emotions this drug was throwing my way; I had started head banging and had a feeling of wanting to just die. The third month again with the self harm_ except this time I ended up causing self mutilation by cutting while feeling like I didn't want to be around anymore again_ that's where I drew the line and my husband and I decided I should stop taking Clomid for good. It effected my quality of life while taking it and put an awful strain on my relationship. I can't wait until it's fully out of my system and I get to be me again. I know everyone's different_ but with what has all happened to me in just 3 months_ I wouldn't recommend ANYBODY to take Clomid.",F,27,3  months50 mg,7/9/2015,Clomid
14, 2, To conceive,First round was fine_ but second month was not good.  Took 4 out of 5 pills and I could barely walk by the afternoons on days 8 and 9 (cycle days). my thighs were so sore like I had run a marathon! I am still sore but much better on day 13. Apparently I am the 1% who gets myalgia.  Lots of fluttering in pelvis_ a bit tired but will not be taking Clomid again. I do ovulate_ so not indicated_ but it was decided that I could try it.  Hoping for twins though!  Fingers crossed:),,F,41,4  days50,5/22/2015,Clomid

52, 3, Unknown infertility,I did have great ovulation on clomid_ but that is the only positive. I had some mild hot flashes_ some mood swings_ and  at times became pretty emotional. The worst part about clomid for me_  has been the dizzy spells. They are so bad I am sometimes afraid to drive. I have decided to take a break from clomid because of the severity of this symptom.,,F,34,2  months50,10/26/2012,Clomid

Bumped up to 100 mg and ovulated on day 13 but no pregnancy. Currently still on 100 mg_ CD 17 and still no ovulation. I chart my temps every morning but nothing has picked up yet. However_ I don't rely heavily on my temps as there can be so many variables while doing so. The past few days I've been crampy but nothing I can't handle. I have my day 21 progesterone levels done this coming week so we'll find out if it was just my chart,,F,33,3  months100 mg,10/19/2012Email,Clomid

Good luck to all!,F,26,1  months50mg 1X D,10/4/2012,Clomid
55, 2, Anovulation,"Holy Jesus. The side effects are horrible; simply put_ personally DEBILITATING.  If you're sensitive to medications or anything you put into your body_ for that matter_ Clomid may not be the right fertility drug for you. I would've appreciated if my OB/GYN told me just how much weight gain is possible on this medication. When I began my 1st cycle of Clomid_ I was 119 lbs and a size 2. I'm 5'2""; I'm short and I know it. I've embraced it over the years with short strides in long-distance running. I've been a marathoner and half-marathoner since age 17. I'm now 36. As for the side effects_ the hot flashes come and go and are deal-able_ but the tremendous weight gain_ abdominal bloating and mood-swings are not welcome_ at all. The first month I took 50 mg Clomid on days 3-7_ I experienced extreme hot-flashes_ abdominal bloating that made me appear as if I were 5-6 months pregnant although I certainly was not_ bizarre mood-swings that had me both crying and laughing within the same",It's 3 days before I am due for my period. THAT_ or the grief of experiencing 2 rounds of Clomid has made it possible that I could indeed be pregnant. I'll be sure to post if I get any positive news. Thanks to all the women who have posted here. It certainly helps reading about your experiences and makes me feel like I'm not entirely alone in this journey.,F,36,2  months50 mg 1X D,10/2/2012Email,Clomid
56, 2, Infertility,None,I am 33 years of age and Clomid didn't live up to its reputation.  My doctor put me on provera_ to re-start my menstrual cycle after a cycle was skipped after a miscarriage_ and then put me on Clomid.  I ovulated late and have subsequently NOT become pregnant.
