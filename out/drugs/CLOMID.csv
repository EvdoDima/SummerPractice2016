9, 3, prescribed not ovulating each month,It's my first cycle taking clomid I have mild spots of endometriosis the doctor warned me I might experience abdominal pain an if it gets too bad they will book me straight in for a scan. For 2 days my stomach has been in agony it's bearable as long as I have painkillers with me at all times I can't walk much because of the pain it hurts when I cough laugh or feel about. I'm hoping it eases off as I don't want to be phoning my consultant to book me in for a scan for no reason I don't want to be wasting her time. It's been 5 days since taking them on days 2-6 of my cycle so maybe it's because I'm currently on day 22 an the pain started day 21 maybe I've ovulated fingers crossed.,,F,25,1  months50mg,10/20/2015Email,Clomid

13, 2, PCOS_ Anovulation & Absent Periods,Caused SEVERE mood swings that got way out of hand as I continued taking the drug. Clomid made me feel like I was not myself. I got into major fights with my husband over things I wouldn't have normally_ broke things I wish I hadn't_ inflicted pain on myself in a few different ways including cutting_ and had feelings of depression and wanting to die. Minor side effects I experienced were hot flashes and night sweats. The symptoms usually started a day or two after finishing the 5th pill for each cycle and lasted for up to 2-3 weeks.,"To elaborate on the ""SEVERE mood swings_"" I was so mentally messed up from this drug that I had boughts of chaotic rage towards my husband. The first month I had successfully embarrassed myself in front of all my neighbors by driving off in a fit of rage and ended up driving up onto my next door neighbors sidewalk like a crazy person; which is a good reason not to drive when angry to begin with_ but I felt I had no control over any of my actions much like The Incredible Hulk. The second month I still got into huge fights with the hubby that ended in me causing self harm due to not being able to handle the strong emotions this drug was throwing my way; I had started head banging and had a feeling of wanting to just die. The third month again with the self harm_ except this time I ended up causing self mutilation by cutting while feeling like I didn't want to be around anymore again_ that's where I drew the line and my husband and I decided I should stop taking Clomid for good. It effected my quality of life while taking it and put an awful strain on my relationship. I can't wait until it's fully out of my system and I get to be me again. I know everyone's different_ but with what has all happened to me in just 3 months_ I wouldn't recommend ANYBODY to take Clomid.",F,27,3  months50 mg,7/9/2015,Clomid
14, 2, To conceive,First round was fine_ but second month was not good.  Took 4 out of 5 pills and I could barely walk by the afternoons on days 8 and 9 (cycle days). my thighs were so sore like I had run a marathon! I am still sore but much better on day 13. Apparently I am the 1% who gets myalgia.  Lots of fluttering in pelvis_ a bit tired but will not be taking Clomid again. I do ovulate_ so not indicated_ but it was decided that I could try it.  Hoping for twins though!  Fingers crossed:),,F,41,4  days50,5/22/2015,Clomid

55, 2, Anovulation,"Holy Jesus. The side effects are horrible; simply put_ personally DEBILITATING.  If you're sensitive to medications or anything you put into your body_ for that matter_ Clomid may not be the right fertility drug for you. I would've appreciated if my OB/GYN told me just how much weight gain is possible on this medication. When I began my 1st cycle of Clomid_ I was 119 lbs and a size 2. I'm 5'2""; I'm short and I know it. I've embraced it over the years with short strides in long-distance running. I've been a marathoner and half-marathoner since age 17. I'm now 36. As for the side effects_ the hot flashes come and go and are deal-able_ but the tremendous weight gain_ abdominal bloating and mood-swings are not welcome_ at all. The first month I took 50 mg Clomid on days 3-7_ I experienced extreme hot-flashes_ abdominal bloating that made me appear as if I were 5-6 months pregnant although I certainly was not_ bizarre mood-swings that had me both crying and laughing within the same",It's 3 days before I am due for my period. THAT_ or the grief of experiencing 2 rounds of Clomid has made it possible that I could indeed be pregnant. I'll be sure to post if I get any positive news. Thanks to all the women who have posted here. It certainly helps reading about your experiences and makes me feel like I'm not entirely alone in this journey.,F,36,2  months50 mg 1X D,10/2/2012Email,Clomid

This is the 3rd round and I decided to take a break from the clomid.  I believe the clomid was still in my system.  It worked.  We are now pregnant.  We also used opk sticks_ which helps pinpoint ovulation.  I believe clomid is safe_ but not to be used longterm_ no more than 6 cycles and up to 250 mg.

My progesterone level on Day 21 was 31.30 which means I ovulated.

My sister took 50mg the first month and didn't get pregnant.. so she rushed and increased her dosage to 100mg during the second month and got pregnant with twins! I am going to be patient as much as possible because I definitely don't want to get twins after seeing what my sister had to deal with! Ha.

I was disorientated_ panicky_ felt like I was on another planet_ and did not sleep a wink. I felt like I did when I had previously been admitted to hospital for what turned out to be a severe panic attack. My advice would be; if you suffer at all from anxiety_ think very carefully about taking this potent drug. If you do really need to_ then book time off from work/daily chores to rest. I found that I could not drive home at one point because I was so disorentated. My consultant told me none of this and this was not described as a side effect on the packet.,,F,40,2  days50MG 1X D,11/7/2011Email,Clomid

I was pulled off Clomid immediately due to the thinned lining- had I continued to take it there is a possibility that it could have made me completely unable to have children. I certainly wasn't going to get pregnant on it_ but was fortunate that I was at a doctor (reproductive endocrinologist- which I also suggest) who kept a close eye on me.

110, 4, Infertility,I am extremely tired_ the first month I took it in the morning and made me extremely nauseous_ this is the second month I am taking it at night and has helped with the nausea. I have also gained weight_ which is about 10 lbs over the past 2 months_ a lot of water weight I can tell_ along with bloating. Some moodiness and headaches.,Because of stage 4 endometriosis and PCOS_ and TTC for over 7 months now on my own my OB started us on Clomid_ no baby the first month just finished up with last dose this month so really excited and praying to conceive this month. Really hoping to get these extra pounds off. 10 lbs might not be a big deal to most_ but I had weight loss surgery 6 years ago and lost 200lbs and I am at a steady weight of 140-145lbs so 10lbs in 2 months is a lot. But I guess I have to remember it is the hormones :) I am still eating and exercising the way I should_ so if others are gaining weight fast it is probably the Clomid. Chin up from what I read it should come off after treatment_ in the first few months of pregnancy most lose a few pounds :) Good luck everyone.,F,31,2  months50 mg 1X D,3/30/2011Email,Clomid

It took us 5 months on clomid to concieve_ which is longer than the estimated 3 months_ but it worked!! My next step was surgery for endometriosis_ and I'm glad I didn't have to resort to that (although I've heard a lot of people have success with it_ it wouldn't have worked for me since I'm also PCOS) I am using it again to try for baby #2.

Have been treated for anxiety in the past_ but not currently on any meds (off meds a year or so).First round taken CD 3-8 = 100mg.   Hot flashes and grumpy.  No big deal -- thought to myself_ wow!  Clomid is great!  I did ovulate a nice big egg_ used timed intercourse -- we didnt get pregnant.Second round taken CD 3-8 = 150mg  On CD 5_ I had a horrific thought wizz in my brain.  Triggered major anxiety and panic.   Had another episode on CD_ 10 (2 days after clomid rx).  Called the dr.   She said that she believed Clomid was to blame and gave me Ativan to ease the panic.   I took one Ativan & felt better in an hour - I have not needed another since.   I called the Mental Health group at my hospital to find a way of dealing with anxiety while going through infertility treatment (sans drugs).  I did ovulate and have a nice big egg waiting for timed intercourse.    Fingers crossed that it works.   Dr. Said NO MORE CLOMID for me.   I asked if my reaction was common_ she said no.  I dont know if I buy after reading online testimonials.

Have been depressed for 5 months and symptoms intensifying so past month has been uncontrollable crying and apathy.  The black depression is just not worth it. Still trying to get over it even though stopped the pills 3 weeks ago. My endometriosis didn't affect ovulation_ but it's possible the clomid has intensified the progress of the endo so now need another operation just 12 months after the last one.  I would not take the pills again_ even though am still trying to fall pregnant after 3 years.,F,33,5  months,8/27/2009,Clomid
227, 3, Infertility,uterine/ovarian cramping during ovulation_ dizziness_ slight nausea_ flatulance_ bloated_ hot flashes_ night sweats_ fatigue,Started taking clomid 100mg on day 3-7_ 1st cycle. I took the pills after coming home from working night shift & went straight to bed in case there were immediate side effects. Initially experienced short episodes of blurred vision_ horrible/uncomfortable hot flashes_ then night sweats. I started ovulating on day 15. The hot flashes and night sweats continued_ started with periodic dizziness_ nausea and feeling faint_ also with ovarian/uterine cramping. I'm now day 16 and hoping this gets better and we get pregnant. I don't think I have been moody and that's confirmed by my husband_ then again he could be trying to be nice.,F,31,5  days,8/25/2009,Clomid
228, 3, Late ovulation/TTC,Ovulation cramping starting day after first pill (sharp twinges as follicles grow)_ this continues until day of O_ intermittent headaches (not bad ones and they would not last long)_ drying of CM.,I've taken clomid for 2 months thus far for late ovulation and TTC.  The first month I was on 50 mgs cycle days 3-7 and I ovulated around Day 20.  The second month I was on 100 mgs on days 3-7 and I ovulated either on day 19 or day 20 (not exactly sure).  Both months I got a BFN.  I am starting my 3rd month next week and will be doing 100 mgs again on either days 3-7_ 4-8 or 5-9 (depending on when AF shows up and when I can get in for my baseline u/s).,F,29,2  months,8/12/2009,Clomid
229, 3, Age factor,My goodness!  This was my first time taking clomid and I didn't feel anything until after the cycle.  Firstly there was intermittent cramping.  This has been happening for a little over a week.  The other major_ major thing_ is this weight gain!! Aaaahhh!!!  What is this all about?  Not a good thing.  Anyway_ my period is supposd to come next week_ hopefully it doesn't :)  Only God knows.,,F,38,5  days,8/7/2009,Clomid
230, 3, PCOS,Blurred vision_ night sweats_ nausea_ dizzyness_ Loss of appetite,Today was my first day of Clomid after 5 days of provera and it has been a very hard week and half.  Pumping my body full of hormnes(Provera) for five days and then having a period for three days and then starting to pump the hormones again(Clomid)has really thrown me for a loop. I had to leave work early today.  The one good side effect_ I guess because of the nausea I've had a loss of appetite.  Which from what I read is uncommon.  Like many of you I'm really hoping it works this first month!!!!,F,24,5  days,8/5/2009,Clomid
231, 4, ttc 3rd child,hot flashes_ moody_ weight gain_ and ovulation cramping,i have been on clomid for 2 months and the 1st month i had only hot flashes. the 2nd go round i had ovulation cramps andi dont know if it due to the clomid but brest tender and have a thick vein around my areola. I did Ovulate and had  big follies. I would suggest other to do it minus the side effect. I did like the fact that it make you feel that you are pregnant when you may not be. but it does help with ovulation.,F,26,2  times,8/3/2009,Clomid
232, 3, Infertility,Major Moodiness while taking Clomid_ pain during ovulation time_ exaggerated pre-period signs- sore breasts_ cramps_ nausea_ moodiness,I better get pregnant soon_ I don't know how much longer my husband can take the moodiness the Clomid brings on! I was on Clomid two years ago and got pregnant the first month. Unfortunately we miscarried. Since then we have miscarried a total of 3 times and had one tubal. We're hoping the Clomid will help get us pregnant faster!,F,28,5  days,8/3/2009,Clomid
233, 2, Unexplained Infertility,Severe lower back pain_ weight gain 10 lbs in 2 months_ constant bloated feeling_ painful breasts,Have only taken it for 2 months and am stopping to see if back pain subsides (Physician unsure if it's the cause_ but it began within a week of my initial start of Clomid. Took Clomid days 3-7.,F,31,5  days,8/2/2009,Clomid
234, 4, Unexplained Infertility,Headaches_ nausea_ dizziness,My first cycle on clomid I took 50mg. days 3-7. I experienced a headache approximately 5 hours after taking the pill every day. The headaches were such that I became sick to my stomach. I was dreading the second round_ but agreed to do it. The first day I was a little sick to my stomach and dizzy_ but NOTHING like the first cycle. This is day two and no side effects. I decided to take the pill at dinner this go around and at bedtime to take 400mg of Advil - this may be the key to helping with the side effects for me. Hoping it will work this time and I don't have to think about it again.,F,28,5  days,7/27/2009Email,Clomid
235, 3, PCOS,Severe cramping and bloating_ flatulance_ headaches_ yeast infection_ severe mood swings_ depression and anxiety_ and hot flashes.,I took Clomid for three months at 50mg.  The first two months were tolerable but the third month I started to get severe anxiety and depression.  I was sad all the time and would burst out in tears for no reason.  I ovulated for those three months but did not get pregant.  My periods seemed shorter too only 3days long when they use to be seven. I'm not taking Clomid anymore and moving on to injections.,F,35,3  months,7/24/2009Email,Clomid
236, 5, PCOS,no side effects,took clomid last year days 1-5 50mg...worked first cycle but unfortunalty our son was still born at eight months. so we decided to try the clomid again. we're doing days 3-7 and this is my last last day on it so we are keeping our fingers crossed that it works as quick as it did last time!!,F,22,5  days,7/14/2009,Clomid
237, 4, PCOS,I have no side effects!,I just finish taking Clomid (cycle 1) (5-9)50mg(once a day) and I feel great. I am still hoping that it worked!!!,F,30,5  days,7/2/2009,Clomid
238, 1, infertility,Absolutely horrible side effects_ severe arrhytmia that landed ne in the emergency room. Dizziness and episodes of severe arrhythmia continued for several years with the worst first year. Gradually improved only on the fifth year.,I took this drug for three menstual cycles_ first two times for 7 days_ third time -- 10 days. DO NOT TAKE_ there are better drugs for infertility!,F,45, ,7/2/2009,Clomid
239, 3, Assist fertility over 40,Just exaggerated my normal symptoms. I had much more painful ovulation. I've had raging headaches several days before my period_ some nausea and sore breasts.,I had 3 folicles the first time_ only 2 the second. Will probably try injectables next round_ on the recommendation of my doctor. I'm willing to endure lots of discomfort in order to conceive our second child at this age. Conceived naturally in 5 months at age 38. Overall_ not too bad. You feel worse during the stressful times_ ovulation and IUI_ and then that awful waiting time just before your period or pregnancy. I've been trying to see if anyone else has these raging headaches before getting your period. I've heard the drop in progesterone causes it_ so I take my monthly headache as a foreboding sign. So not happy_ and I feel crappy. Don't want to take medicine in case I am pregnant_ so I suffer through it.Don't know whether it is psychological or not_ but I've felt like I've had pregnancy symptoms each month we've tried. I've felt nauseous_ headachey_ sore nipples. But when I look back at my first pregnancy_ I had none of that_ so I guess I need to interpret these symptoms as clomid symptoms and not pregnancy. Hope this helps someone - good luck everyone! Hate the stress_ but a baby is worth it!,F,41,2  months,6/25/2009,Clomid
240, 2, Clomid Challenge,Headache_ anxiety_ moodiness_ emotional_ bloating_ paranoia_ constipation_ hot flashes_ insomnia,I ovulate on my own but my Dr. had prescribed 50 mg to stregnthen ovulation.  I took it for one cycle and at that time decided that the side effects were not worth it and I did not use it again. We've been trying to conceive for about a year or so off and on with no success so I wanted to make sure there was nothing wrong.  Fertility Dr. put me on 100 mg days 5-9 as part of the Clomid Challenge.  I made it through to day 8 and could not bear to take the last dose. I knew what the common side effects were but did not know about the insomnia_ paranoia and anxiety.  I was extremely emotional crying at everything for the last 2-3 days.  If this is the only way I can get pregnant then I don't think i could do it.,F,37,4  days,6/25/2009,Clomid
241, 5, Don't ovulate_ Endometriosis & more,Hot flashes LIKE CRAZY you wouldn't believe the hot flashes! Dizzy_ HUNGRY all the time man I am so freaking FAT & i aint even pregnant! Mood Swings now let me tell you they are EXTREME one min PISSED off & the next bawling my eyes out & then HAPPY! I have bloating & last but not least severe severe pain in my abdomen so bad that I went to the Er they didn't do anything for me cause I wouldn't take pain pills cause they would potentially hurt our chances of getting pregnant,I have come down with a rash on both sides of my hips that ITCH like crazy not sure if its a side effect but haven't been outside to get anything & I was supposed to O 14-19 somewhere between that so maybe after I O I got a rash??

244, 4, TTC_ annovulatory,Ovary cramping_ Uterine cramping_ mood swings_ hot flashes_ extremely tender breasts after ovulation_ heartburn_ and yeast infection,I'm now on my second cycle of Clomid and the side effects have yet to arrive. Most of them happened after ovulation and were very irritating but not unbearable. It did make me ovulate on CD16 so I am satisfied that it is indeed helping us.,F,22,2  months,6/15/2009,Clomid
245, 2, ovulation,night sweats_ extreme fatigue_ increased hunger_  moodiness and short temper,This is only my second round at 50mg. Based on others' comments_ I am nervous of having to increase dosage if I am this affected already.  Hopefully I will not have to - on second day of clomid and hoping it works!,F,38,2  months,6/8/2009,Clomid

247, 4, PCOS - Thin Cyster,Blurry vision/floaters_ Hot Flashes_ severe bloating_ moodiness_ weepiness,Taken at night CD 3-7 100mg. Clomid along with an hCG trigger shot helped me ovulated larger_ more mature eggs both cycles. Biggest complaint would be the abdominal cramping_ it was really bad during second round_ which included an IUI. Not sure if this cycle worked but I'm not sure I will do it again because of the emotional roller-coaster and pain which has been affecting my work.,F,28,2  months,5/27/2009,Clomid

Brought a 15 day bleeding period down to a normal 3-5 day period. Of course_ you feel like everyone says a pregnant lady does... so I guess be prepared.,F,22,6  months,5/25/2009,Clomid
250, 2, infertility/artificial insemination,headaches_ hot flashes_ shortened my periods,No complaints about the shortened periods. :) Went from 7 days duration to 2-1/2 to 3 days.  The headaches were manageable and the hot flashes only happened the 4th cycle.  Unfortunately I used it for 4 cycles and did not get pregnant.,F,38,4  months,5/13/2009,Clomid
251, 3, anovulation,Extreme irritability and moodiness,Successful with last pregnancy during 2nd month on Clomid - 50mg.

252, 5, TTC,SEVERE DIZZINESS!!! Slightly emotional_ but only during the 5 days of pills.,The first two months on clomid were fine_ little to no side effects_ mainly emotional.  This is my 3rd month and OH MY GOSH_ the dizziness is unbearable.  I have to be careful not to fall.  It began on the first day of the pills and has continued even though my last pill was 5 days ago.  I am going to the doc to make sure this is normal.  It is driving me crazy_ and I have decided not to take clomid next month.,F,29,3  months,5/8/2009,Clomid
253, 4, Infertility,hot flashes_ headaches_ breast tenderness,Cycle 1 100 mg days 5-9.  I did ovulate on this cycle.  I am starting Cycle 2 @ 150 mg days 3-7.  I had only one day of emotional issues.  For most of the cycle_ aside from the side effects I listed_ I felt great.,F,31,2  months,5/7/2009,Clomid
254, 3, Unexplained infertility,Very itchy/dry skin starting around day 12.  Acne breakout worse than when I was a teenager around ovulation.  Delayed ovulation v. non-Clomid cycles (I'm usually like clock work - Day 14-15).  Terrible nausea starting Day 24.,Was on Clomid Days 3-7.  Produced two follicles_ but only one was the right size.  Had to have HCG shot to induce ovulation.,F,38,5  days,5/6/2009,Clomid
255, 4, Fertility,I've had no negative side effects.,After reading so many horror stories about the side effects of Clomid_ I decided to still take the medication and I'm glad I did! I'm on my first cycle_ days 3-7_ 50mg and I've felt great. My attitude is still great_ I'm not getting emotional over everything_ which I've been known to do on other medications like Yaz and medications simular to that. Thats why I was really hesitant to take Clomid due to the fact I have a history of horrific emotional effects from other medications. I hope this helps others_ and I hope it helps us conceive!!,F,38,4  days,5/3/2009Email,Clomid
256, 3, Artificial Insemination.,MAJOR SLEEPINESS AND IRRITATION,Today is my 9th day.  I took my Clomid days 3-7 and this is my first try.  I'm so tired I can hardly function.  This all started yesterday_ day 8 of my cycle.  And I have been practically homicidal.  Everyone is irritating me to no end and I am major weepy.  Ug.  I pray this first time works so I don't have to take another doseage of this stuff.,F,29,5  days,4/27/2009Email,Clomid
257, 5, Annovulation,Happiness. Periods of exhaustion.,It sounds crazy (I've read all about the negative side effects from ten different web sites)but for the last three days I have had this sense of intense happiness.  I guess you could call it a mood swing!  I'm usually in a good mood but this is intense...I feel elated all the time. Even when I am so tired - I feel happy.  I am thankful that I have had a good experience with clomid and I wanted others to know there is the chance that you won't feel the bad side effects.,F,33,4  days,4/25/2009,Clomid

I think I'm starting to get hot flashes too.,I have to say I'm glad I haven't been as moody as I was after taking the Provera (holy crap!).

259, 3, Unexplained Infertility,uterine cramping_ lower back pain_ dizziness_ hot flashes_ moodiness_ vivid dreams_ blurred vision_ nausea_ hair loss and scalp infection_ severe weight gain.,First month the symptoms were mild_ a little bloating but nothing severe. It was a successful cycle in conjunction with IUI but resulted in miscarriage at 5 weeks. Started again after a 2 month break and symptoms have been building and getting even more severe. I have uterine cramping_ lower back pain_ dizziness_ hot flashes_ moodiness_ vivid dreams_ blurred vision_ nausea_ hair loss and scalp infection. Since being on this medication I have gained over 20lbs. It is frustrating that these side effects are never discussed thoroughly before one is given these pills. This is my last cycle before being reevaluated by my specialist and I am hoping it is successful so I can be done with this medication completely. I have reached the point where it has built up in my system so much that there is not a day where I feel normal during my cycle. I have taken 3 out of the 5 days doses and I am already having cramps and lower back pain.  I know this medication works for some women but I also think it is handed out like candy from specialists who are stumped with the small percentage of women with unexplained infertility.,F,35,4  months,4/15/2009Email,Clomid

266, 1, Fertility Testing,I lost my mind- no kidding.  Worst experience of my life.,"It was a test to see if my estrogen levels were acceptable for IVF at age 45_ pushing my reproductive system to the limit_ 100mgs a day for 5 days.  The doctor and the package insert and all available information said there should be no side effect.  The nurse said maybe I'd be a little emotional_ cry at TV commercials.  This was gross understatement.  I completely lost control of my emotions and my mind.  I horrific thought would enter my mind and I could not turn away from it.  I had a meltdown just sitting in the salon- no reason.  Their continued denials sent me to a psychiatrist who also knew nothing about these effects.  Only once I was accepted into IVF program and met their psychologist_ she told me about the ""Branch Clomidians""- (reference to the Branch Davidians_ a bit of humor) and how often this drug melts women's minds.  It took about 3 months for the effects to completely wear off.  As I helped a friend with breast cancer (unrelated) and faced my own cancer scare",F,45,5  days,3/12/2009,Clomid

I also keep crying like a baby all the time for no reason and I once I start it is really difficult to stop!!,I have yet to see if clomid will work for me. I pray it does because I am at my wits end.

We decided to have another baby nothing happened. After 2 1/2 yrs trying we were ref to a Fertility consultant and conceived after one course of clomid. Very sadly our little girl was stillborn at 29 weeks. I did not have any tests during pregnancy and found out she had Downs Syndrome after she was born.As far as I am aware chromosone deffects are a possible side effect but we will never know if this was the cause.

I felt happier & alot more energetic while being on Clomid :),I wrote that I was put on 2 Clomid cycle in a month as my follies werent actually growing well. Was on CD3-7 & now CD12-16. I read that in rare cases_ some patients were put on this arrangement_ reason being the 2nd round in a month were needed to 'spank' the follies to 'wake up'.

273, 1, Infertility,Prescribed by my GP (PCP) in the UK some 12 years ago - do I ever remember the side-effects - hourly hot-flashes_ moodiness_ headaches and nausea - but the life changing side-effect was an alarming 40lb weight gain in the 3 cycles (months) of being on the drug. I put up with the side effects because they were listed on the side of the packet_ was told they would cease after the treatment and (of course) I always hoped that the end would justify the means.  Then we moved house and I never saw the original doctor again.,Why am I commenting so many years years later?a) Clomid didn't work b) it changed my metabolism forever and I am now a full 60lb overweightc) I have yet to fully get over the emotional damage this drug caused.   Question - has anyone else experienced such uncontrolled weight gain - I have tried every official and unofficial diet.  What works to reverse drug side-effect weight gain?  What part of my metabolism / hormones / thyroid could it have affected? ,F,42,3  months,2/13/2009,Clomid

I read Clomid is supposed to be taken 5 days in a cycle but I was put on 2 x 5 days in a cycle/month. Hope i dont get ill coz of this strange dosage?,F,37,9  days,2/9/2009,Clomid

The cramps are so bad that I feel constipated_ nauseous_ bloated_ like I am about to have diarrhea_ and explode all at the same time. It comes in waves but there is no comfortable position right now_ and heating pads (which usually help my cramps) are not doing anything right now. All I can do is cry.,I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 13_ and have had the lap. surgery to remove the cysts and endometriosis about 3 years ago_ I tried unsuccessfully to get pregnant during that time and am trying clomid now. Before clomid_ I did ovulate once in a blue moon but I wasn't charting or testing then. With clomid_ I'm beginning my 3rd cycle now_ I ovulated on the second cycle and have high hopes on the 3rd cycle_ I am using the basal_ cm and opk's. I take 50mg on cd 5-9 and experience extreme side effects cd 12- cd 28. I'm grateful for clomid_ this is my last cycle I get to try it_ so I hope it works this time. Good luck to all you other ladies that are ttc.,F,23,2  months,1/28/2009Email,Clomid
279, 4, Not ovulating,I was prescribed 50mg once a day on days 3-7.  I experienced sleepiness and hot flashes and that's about it.  The sleepiness was the first 2 days and then the hot flashes came the last 3 days. Other than that_ I had no problems.,,,35,5  days,1/21/2009,Clomid
280, 2, TTC/ Infertility,Severe moodiness_ irritbility_ trouble sleeping_ significant weight gain.,I went through three rounds of Clomid after laproscopy to remove cysts_ and with negative results. I am only 21_ so I should be able to concieve pretty easily_ so it was dissapointing. I am trying a natural remedy for now_ and may consider Clomid if I get desperate. However_ my husband has begged me never to take it again whenever the conversation arises. I think it is just one of those things that works well for some people_ and not so well for others. I have friends who used it with great results_ especially for those who already had children. I have found a lot of feedback that points to second time mothers having a lot more success than women trying to concieve for the first time.,F,21,3  months,1/12/2009,Clomid

289, 4, TTC,The only side effect I have had is increased appetite with abnormally extreme hunger pains.  Other than that_ nothing. Still had a lot of cervical fluid_ which definitely helped when TTC.,"This month was the first time I ovulated on time without any guess work. The ovulation predictor test was positive on day 17_ which has never happened for me that early. So far this drug has taken away the stress of ""will I ovulate this month and when"" which seems to have run over and over in my head the past year.

I have also found myself emotional and that taking clomid is interfering with everyday activities.,,F,38,5  days,11/22/2008Email,Clomid

A blood test taken two days ago showed progesterone levels were borderline.  I feel it worked_ though_ because now my breasts are really tender_ I am fatigued_ and I have an increased appetite.

301, 2, Unexplained Infertility,It made me very sleepy.  I took it in the middle of the day and I was asleep 20 minutes later.  I have also experienced severe bloating and weight gain.,The weight gain has been the hardest side effect to deal with.  I have tried very hard to keep my body in shape so I can have a happy healthy pregnancy and baby......now_ the very thing that could get me that baby is making me fat.  I have taken 100mg of Clomid for 1 cycle with no pregnancy.  I am about to start my second cycle also at 100mg.  I'm looking forward to it working this time but not the extra 5 lbs it will give me.,F,38,1  months,9/11/2008,Clomid
302, 3, To regulate ovulation,Depression_ sadness_ crying_ moodiness,I started last month at the lowest dose (50mg). It did not work. Side effects were hard to deal with. It takes about a week after you stop taking it to get out of your system. I'm fine again now. If I get pregnant_ it will be worth it. You just have to remember that the side effects will pass. I'm a completely different person when taking it. Hopefully the effects are not worse with a higher dose next month.,F,30,1  months,8/4/2008,Clomid

308, 4, Delayed ovulation/long cycles,mild hot flashes_ mood swings (but not too outrageous--mostly sadness)_ bloating.,"I took 50 mg CD3-7.  My side effects were really quite mild.  If I hadn't already read what common side effects were I may not have attributed them to anything other than the usual PMS symptoms.  I also took my pills right before bed_ I'd heard that could minimize the side effects.  The ovulation pain was more intense_ but it at least let me know ""something"" was going on down there.  My OB/GYN was not closely moniotoring me this first round_ so I only know I ovulated due to temperature charting and also using the ClearBlue Easy Fertility Monitor.",F,34,5  days,6/5/2008,Clomid

I have been depressed alot this month and I have never felt this way before. Normally I am so happy and let things just roll off my back. Now everything gets to me_ be it good bad or other. I am on my 5th month with one month left to take clomid. I am hoping it works this time!!,I think this is a great way to get preg.

I feel like the drs are grasping at straws to figure out why I can't get pregnant_ and what to do about it. Last month was our first failed IUI. They are suggesting more clomid and another IUI. Very frustrating after 2 years. While I like the feeling that I am ""doing something"" about my infertilty_ the 6 day string of migraines is too much.",F,31,3  months,5/24/2008,Clomid

Irritability.,Not sure how this will turn out_ but I remain optimistic...we have a daughter (3) who was conceived naturally and in no time (2nd month we were married!:) I tried many natural means for the last 2 years and so I have finally resigned to man-made intervention!  I am on 100mg from day 3 to day 7 combined with IUI at the clinic.  This is our second round.

I only have one more month and my ob/gyn said we are going to try a different approach.  Overall it is not that bad.  You have to expect that when you are altering your hormones that it may mess with you.  Is it worth it? Yes because without it there is no chance I can have a baby.

322, 2, trying to conceive,This drug thinned my uterine lining very badly and dried up all cervical mucus.  I was put on estrogen to counteract the side effects_ and the estrogen completely prevented me from ovulating.  I have now had to take 4 months off of ttc and have had several anovulatory cycles.  The doctor warned me that it could be months before my lining returns to normal.,,F,34,3  months,4/26/2008,Clomid
323, 2, Infertility,"Mood Swings!  Uncontrollable crying_ ovarian cramps_ cysts_ and the hot flashes were aweful.  Started at 50mg then went gradually to 150mg.  At 150mg it was the worst!  I was contastly hungry.  Increased appeitite for sure.  Protein is the trick there.  Lots of protein to sustain hunger.  My doctor just put me on Femara for my next round of fertility drugs.  My poor husband has hung in there like a champ!  He just says_ ""You're having a Clomid moment_ right?""  Noticed vaginal dryness_ not good when you're trying to conceive!  Some headaches_ nothing Aleve couldn't handle.",Clomid didn't work for me_ but there are plenty of women who it has worked for.  Everyone is different and other than normal female side effects_ it isn't that bad.  If you Doc prescribes it first round_ go with the flow.  Don't be surprised if you start at a low dose and it increases over months.  At 150mg_ I had huge ovaries at the sonogram and then took the shot of HG drug to release the eggs.  Still not pregnant.

I am on cycle day 17 and still no ovulation. DOES ANYONE know if it takes a few months on Clomid to start ovulating or DOES ANYONE KNOW of anyone that ovulated after Day 17 on Clomid?????

330, 4, Not ovulating,I had no side effects while taking my first 5 day cycle of 50mgs.  However_ when I finished the cycle I began to notice becoming increasingly irritable_ depressed_ and forgetful.  The hot flashes are frequent as well.  I am also super tired.  I also experience some cramping_ but nothing too serious.,It seems that the side effects are different for everyone. It is nice to have some cramping again.  It gives the hope that something is happening.,M,28, ,4/4/2008,Clomid
331, 3, trying to conceive,This is my 2nd cycle on 100mg and last night I wanted to scratch my legs off.  I washed my feet and legs_ slathered them in cream_ then hydrocortisone cream and covered with socks_ but still itched like crazy into the night.  Finally took 2 benedryl and this morning things are ok.  I hope I get pregnant so that I don't have to have any more itchy leg syndrome!!!,1st cycle I definitely ovulated  (based on u/s and progestrone)_ but didn't get pg.

Fatigue_ BIG ovarian cramping_ and who knows if the moods are the Clomid or frustration over trying to conceive.,Currently on my second cycle of Clomid_ obviously the first one didn't do the trick but my friend did remind me that this drug is supposed to take 3-6 months to work.,F,33,5  days,3/27/2008Email,Clomid

335, 4, not ovulating,BAD headaches and insomnia,I am pretty sure I ovulated (at least I hope so).  I had two similar pink lines on my ovulation test_ 6 days after my last dose.  Just be sure to take the ovulation tests 4 days after your last dose_ because clomid can affect the results and give a false-positive.  I have to wait to get my blood drawn in a week to be sure that I did ovulate.,F,31,5  days,3/18/2008,Clomid
336, 4, Infertility,INSOMNIA,I am on my second round of clomid and had no idea that insomnia was a side effect.

I've only taken my first dose today ... need sleep!,F,32,2  months,3/17/2008,Clomid
337, 1, Infertility,I experienced all effects on clomid and they seemed to get  worse over the period of dosages I would take. Day 1 started out with feeling overly anxious_depressed_ paranoid_ Day 2 stomach ache_day 3 I was ready to run thru a brick wall(mentally) and I was so iiritable by this point_ Next was chest pain_ difficulity breathing_restlessness_ couldn't focus_ hot flahses and heart rate would be very rapid or flutter_ I also was extremly dizzy.  It made me into a monster.  I ended up going to the ER and found out I was allergic to the drug.  It is a very low percentage of cases but I (who have no drug allergies) felt very confident that I would not have the side effects. The doctor in the ER said that Clomid will remain in my body for about another 5 days and currently I being treated with sterroids and benadryl to counteract the side effects of the drug.,I was shocked that this happened. But reading thru some of the other listed stories I realize that I am not the only one who dealt with this.  I was very disappointed in how my Fertility Spec approach me when I told her.  I think that the bad side effects are more severe than people report or know about.  I already have 1 child and am trying for #2...instead of this route I will go with natural ways diet/herbs_ acupuncture etc rather than play with mother nature.,F,31,5  days,3/12/2008Email,Clomid

339, 3, Trying to concieve,The first 2 days on this medication were completely normal. I was quite suprised. But_ by the 3 evening I turned into a crazy person. I cry all of the time for no reason and have become very depressed. I'm usually a very calm_ happy go lucky person_ but while on this medication_ I am extremly angry and temperamental. My husband can barely stand to be in the same room as me_ which is in turn_ making me cry more. I also have been getting headaches.,Despite all of the side effects_ the drug is working. Hopefully_ we will get pregnant this time around_ so I won't have to use it again. I do have some cramping due to the fact that I'm ovulating.,F,26,5  days,3/10/2008,Clomid
340, 3, To ovulate,Only hot flashes,I took my first dose of 50mg on 02/09/08 for 5 days. Im pretty sure I ovulated at the end of the month much later then I should have. Has anyone else had their period pushed later because of clomid?,F,27,1  months,3/7/2008,Clomid

This cycle_ however_ I have a severe headache and blurry vision.  Additionally_ I am having moderate pain in my abdomen and lower back. Although this might not be purely a result of the clomid (as I am currently on CD3 and AF is still here) I did not experience this during my last cycle.  Further_ AF has been markedly different this month it feels more severe than non-clomid cycles.  As far as the way I would rate clomid_ it did work to get me super-ovulating...but I am not pregnant.  The RE suggests 3 months on clomid before advancing to more agressive measures.,F,25,2  months,1/14/2008,Clomid

363, 3, Not ovulating,Visual disturbances_ light headed_ fatigue_ headachey_ irritable,TTC 2nd time round. First pregnancy happened without trying. This is my 4th round of Clomid. First round (50mg)I didn't ovulate despite the eggs growing to reasonable size. 2nd round monitored and was given pregnyl to stimlulate ovulation but we waited a bit too long to see if I would ovulate on my own so pregnyl was given when eggs were just a big too big. Then 3rd round everything looked perfect and we tried AI. My period was 3 days late which I'm told is a good sign... luteal phase longer.... Anyway_ giving it another shot. On day 3 of the clomid.

364, 3, trying to conceive,No severe side effects_ but around pms time_ symptoms are stronger than usual--including fatigue_ mood swings_ feeling emotional_ and painful swollen breasts.  Also_ I occasionally got feelings in my extremities (hands and feet) that felt a little like bolts of electricity only when doing more strenuous exercise.  Perhaps that was my version of hot flashes.,I took 50 mg for 5 days a month_ for treatment in conjunction with an IUI.  It certainly worked_ as I produced 2-3 eggs/month.  And even though the side effects were not severe_ I felt like this last month because I had more external stress factors_ I felt the most emotional from the Clomid.  Since this was my 3rd month in conjunction with an IUI_ which I have a feeling has likely failed_ we will probably move on to IVF for our situation.  I am glad to stop Clomid because even though the side effects were not severe_ you still don't feel quite yourself sometimes.,F,32,3  months,11/16/2007,Clomid

If you are taking Clomid_ try to remind yourself often why you are taking the Clomid and forgive yourself immediately for any bad moods or feelings you are experiencing.

393, 3, Anovulation due to PCOS,Fatigue_ mood swings_ bloating and pain around ovaries_ headaches_ highly emotional.,I was diagnosed with PCOS in January 2007 and immediately prescribed clomid to assist with ovulation (taken on days 2-6 of cycle_ which in turn was induced by Provera). The initial 50mg dose had no effect_ and was increased to 100mg for the second cycle. This did induce ovulation_ resulting in pregnancy_ though I went on to miscarry at 6 weeks. When I again took the 100mg dose_ subsequent to the miscarriage_ it did not work. My consultant recommended an operation called laparoscopic ovarian drilling to remove the cysts. This was at the beginning of June_ and the hope was that I would begin to ovulate naturally after the operation (as is the case for 80% - 90% of women).

I almost didn't take it the second round because of all of the side effects - particularly the weepiness_ depression_ and anxiousness.  At work_ I will cry over the most insignificant things. I manage a team of 15 people; this is extremely embaressing and uncharacteristic. I have to excuse myself from meetings to avoid crying in front of them.  I am willing to put up with the side effects if it increases my chances of getting pregnant.

They are completely worth it if we get pregnant!,I've been charting since 06/06_ and every month it appears I've ovulated_ but RE wanted to start me on Clomid just in case. 1st tried Clomid (50mg) in Dec/06_(lots of ovulation pain lasted week before and after ovulation) but DH's SA came back 0-count_ so we stopped the Clomid while he used HGH & HCG to raise testosterone_ then Menopur(FSH?) injections to help with sperm production. Count came up to 30 mil & low motility w/in about 6 wks of starting Menopur. (RE was hoping for 5 mil....small miracles everyday!) Back on Clomid(100mg) for the last 3 months. LOTS of hot flashes and fatigue (wake up exhausted.) Lots of Neg Preg tests along the way. PCT this month....we'll see what's next. BTW_ I highly recommend using www.fertilityfriend.com for charting.

409, 1, Infertility,dizziness & fatigue,I took it for 3 rounds.  After the 3rd round the side effects never went away.  The doctor told me that it wasn't the drug causing me to feel sick.  After 7 months of visiting every doctor under the sun (and having a bunch of tests)_ they finally diagnosed me with a-typical migraines.  I don't have the headaches but have a bunch of the other symptoms.  They believe it was caused by a hormone imbalance from the Clomid.  I stopped trying to get pregnant because I felt so bad.  I am on migraine meds now and am going to find a new infertility doctor!,F,36,3  times,6/13/2007,Clomid

My husband and I had sex a few days before my est ovualation date and I had a little bleeding...then I had pain that ran from my abdomen all the way down both legs.  I was in too much pain to even try to conceive.  Dr said that a cyst may have formed and then burst causing this pain.  I have just started my second dose_ so maybe this one will be better.

416, 3, Low Progesterone,Very emotional.  Could cry over anything.  Also my temper was short at times.  Depressed a lot as well.  My ovaries would hurt quite a bit around ovulation time.,"One thing my Dr did not tell me was that Clomid can dry you out and that this prevents the sperm from being able to stay alive and travel into your cervix and find your egg.  I wish I would have known this at the beginning so that I could try something different.  I had an hsg done which was very painful and the day after_ had dry grey film in my vagina.  It scared me and the dr' told me to douche and it will flush it all out.  They acted like they had never heard of that before.  I did douche and within a few days I was fine.  I think it was because I was soooo dry inside from the Clomid that they dye stuck in there.  WARNING:  If Clomid makes you dry_ you need to tell your Dr you need somthing to help you produce the correct fluids to help the sperm swim!  And_ read the book ""Taking Charge of Your Own Fertility"".  It is a life changer.  I have been trying for 2 years and just read the book a few months ago.  Took Clomid for 6 months.

453, 4, Infertility,NONE! Well_ maybe a little bloating/slight headache but that also could've been side effects from my period,I am on my first cycle (50 mgs_ days 5-9) but feel better emotionally than before I took it.  We'll see what happens,F,32, ,3/18/2007,Clomid
454, 3, irregular ovulation (SR update),Good side effects were that period pains suffered for years appear to have gone.  Breast tenderness appears to have gone.  Bad side effects are still insomnia_ intense hot sweats and bad tempers like you wouldn't believe.,Been on clomid now for 3 months.  Each month think this is the one to make me pregnant.  Back at the hospital in April for results and what happens next.  Will write and update after that.,F,36,3  months,3/18/2007Email,Clomid

456, 5, PCOS - no ovulation,Headaches all day every day while taking Clomid_ spots in vision_ extreme mood swings.,Yes_ Clomid did work for me - I ovulated all 5 times I was on it_ didn't get pregnant and we are now moving onto Clomid + IUI.  However_ the side effects were awful for me.  I only gave Clomid a 5 because it did work - I ovulated.  It would be very unfair for me to give it a 1 because of the side effects if it does get me pregnant.  I hate the side effects and if there was something else that I could do that would make me ovulate without the side effects_ I would take it in a heartbeat.  I tried getting my husband on board with more natural methods of inducing ovulation_ but so far he's against it.,F,27,5  days,3/14/2007Email,Clomid
457, 4, Not Ovulating,Overly emotional_ weepy_ cramping around ovulation and hot flashes.,1st cycle I was on 50mg CD 3-7 made me ovulate and progesterone at 34. So far so good now I'm starting 2nd cycle with same dosage. Let's hope it works this 2nd time around.,F,27,2  months,3/7/2007Email,Clomid
458, 4, irregular ovulation,I know it is early_ but I am just so excited! So far_ I am on day 2 of my first cycle_ the side effects are insomnia and I am hyper and happier than usual.,I will check back later with how I felt the rest of the cycle and if it works!,F,30,2  days,3/7/2007,Clomid

461, 4, not ovulating,Hot flashes_ night sweats_ crying spells_ high body temperature,50mg did not make me ovulate the first month. 100mg made me ovulate the next 4 months but still no pregnancy. We then found out an additional culprit: my husband had a very low sperm count. We tried a round of IVF but it did not work. He has since been retested and his sperm count has increased enough to be able to try naturally with Clomid again. I don't like the side effects of Clomid_ but it is MUCH less $ and MUCH less invasive than IVF! I hope we are on the right track now.,F,26,5  months,2/18/2007,Clomid
462, 3, irregular ovulation,emotional outburst weepiness_ depression_ mood swings.  Disturbed sleep patterns_ waking with hot flushes.,Have been taking clomid for 2 months now.

463, 2, fertility,Started taking clomid Jan 31_ 2007 (50 mg). cd 5-9. Very first day of taking it had headache_ blurred vision_ terrible mood swings - not patient with my two children 8y rs and 3 yrs - didn't know why until I read this web site and I'm darn glad I did  because I felt terrible yelling at them_ but didn't know why_ now I know it was the clomid! Had horrible horrrible cramping and bloating_ weepiness_ depression_ hot flashes_ nausea_ insomnia_ bloating - EVERYTHING! I've been tested and my Dr. said all my levels are fine_ have reg cd and O. Don't know why I'm not getting pregnant other than my age. I'm very healthy and fit (thankgoodness_ I added sprints/running to my workout routine this week just to get this stuff to flush out of my system.) I thought all the symptoms would stop once I stopped taking clomid (I've only taken it one cycle) but still have the  bad cramps and nausea. I'm on cd 19 and I really doubt this stuff worked for me. I'll be shocked if it did - but won't be taking it,I really want to congratulate all those who stuck it out on clomid and/or got pregnant! You are really lucky. Please be careful to all the rest of you ladies who take this drug like candy. I've read some sites where some take it without their dr. supervision. I am not certain this drug is safe - it can increase uterine cancer and cysts. Just be careful.,F,41,5  days,2/14/2007,Clomid
464, 4, increase chances of pregnancy at 40,I didn't have many side effects (day 3-8 100 Mg) that I recall at the time.  It did work to stimulate more mature eggs (4!) and I had IUI about 10 days ago.  I am now feeling very bloated and have to urine more so I don't know if that is the side effects of the Clomid due to my uterine lining being thicker_ or signs of pregnancy - we shall see.  This is my 1st Clomid Cycle.,,F,40,30  days,2/13/2007,Clomid

467, 3, low prog. level,Hot flashes (I am usually the coldest person in the world)_ bloating_ soreness during taking the pill. Now on cd 21 and I have had nausea_ fatigue_ food adversion_ and weakness. I guess this is from clomid too.,My first cycle of clomid. I am on 100mg for days 5-9. My husband had a reversal in June 2005 and we had to take 7 mo. of last year due to Iraq deployment. We have a DD soon to be 13 and a DS about to turn 10. So we are hoping this works as he leaves again this year.,F,29,5  days,2/4/2007Email,Clomid

469, 5, Not ovulating,None,I started taking clomid 5 months ago for the first 3 cycles I was on 100mg days 2-6_ then the last 2 cycles on 100mg days 2-10_ I am now 6 weeks pregnant!! I would definately recommend this drug.,F,27,5  months,1/23/2007Email,Clomid
470, 3, Increase ovulation,I had varying side effects each month I took the meds - three months.  The first month I had severe cramping_ Dr. checked for problems_ but there were none.  also experienced a little weepiness and tender nipples.  The second month I had very few physical symptoms_ but had mood swings and irritibility.  The third month I just generally felt lousy and had severe depression which lasted 6 days lifted almost overnight.,Although the medication did stimulate my ovaries and I produced more than just one egg_ I did not become pregnant.  I suppose if I had all the suffering would have been worth it_ but I made an appointment with my Dr. to try some other medication because the depression I experianced during my third cycle was so extreme and dangerous.,F,29,3  months,1/17/2007,Clomid
471, 3, Unexplained Infertility,Severe mood swings_ I cried each of the five days that I took it!  After the five days_ all symptoms went away.,On my first month_ I went to the doc on the 16th day of my cycle and I had just ovulated on my own without the shot!  Was very lucky as it's not so common to ovulate without the shot.  I will definitely stop back by and update if I get pregnant within this six months.  Doc says we have unexplained infertility_ no reason we shouldn't have gotten pregnant already.  We've been trying for 2 years and it's hard to even get my hopes up anymore_ very discouraging.  Hopefully this works!,F,22,5  days,1/16/2007Email,Clomid
472, 4, PCOS,The only side effects that I ever noticed from the Clomid were hot flashes and mood swings which were mild.,Clomid helped me tremendously when it came to ovulating. On our 3rd round of 100mg cd3-7 we got pregnant with twins_ only to lose them to an ectopic (which is not Clomid related). I would recommend that if any woman is having troubles ovulating or if you have been diagnosed with PCOS and you aren't already taking to ask your doctor about it.,F,24,4  months,1/4/2007,Clomid
473, 2, infertility,I took 50 mg of Clomid from day 5 to 9 of my cycle. The first day I experienced bad cramps_ mild nausea and a slight headache. My period_ which lasts 8 days_ stopped for 24 hours.  I continued to take Clomid from day 6 thru 9 without further problems.  However_ I experienced severe ovulation pains_ painful urination and abdomen sensitivity to touch and light pressure.  Clomid did not increase the amount of eggs/follicles.  I ovulated like I normally would without it.  I have discontinued to take it_ choosing IUI without medication.,Clomid is not for everyone.  In my case_ I only had negative effects and none of the positive ones.  Hopefully IUI without it will work still.,F,39,5  days,1/4/2007,Clomid
474, 4, To help me super ovulate,Bloating_headaches_mood swings;severe ovulation pain,My husband has low sperm count so doc placed me on clomid to super ovulate so we can have the best chance of conceiving naturally. I usually get ovulation pain but since on clomid it has increased 10 times.I can feel slight pain on the days leading to ovulation and then on the day of ovulation_ massive pain. It is sometimes hard to have intercourse on that day but my husband and I still try.The pain usually subsides after about one to two days and starts all over again next ovulation. Trying to conceive 2 yrs now_ low sperm count the major fertility problem.,F,26,5  months,12/31/2006,Clomid

Clomid is just the start of options for infertility . 2 months of clomid 50 mg. Blood test shows ovulation but no pregnancy.  Asked my doctor to send me for a follicle count. I wanted to know for myself what the clomid is doing. Before clomid_ only 3 follicles on one side_ zero on the other (normal sb 10-15 on each side).,F,33,2  months,12/29/2006,Clomid

I was off clomid for a few months now I'm back on no success round 4 currently on round 5 hopefully it works since i only can take 6 cycles.  no blurred vision but i tend to be more moody.  maybe because the hot flashes are uncomfortable.,overall i think clomid is great.  i never get periods and have been trying for two years so the fact that we were able to concieve at all even though it was an ectopic was a great accomplishment.,F,25,5  months,11/27/2006,Clomid

My follicles were still too small and there were no sight of a dominate follicle.  I'll go in for another ultrasound on day 22.  I'm worried about the side effects as my doctor has not monitored my ovaries since putting me on clomid.The doctor's office is recommending me to increase dosage to 150mg for the next cycle.  I will do clomid one more time.  After that_ I will have to consider an acupuncturist and natural remedies to balance my hormones_ and start over.The thought of not being able to conceive is depressing.
