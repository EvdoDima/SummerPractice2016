0, 1, some made up bullshit out of dsm,Here's an idea...create a drug that literally makes you fat...not just fat like diabetic fat...hmmm more money in the long run ;). OR how about it gives you a heart condition...excellent that means you can take more drugs...$$$ yesss. OR one that shrinks your brain so your so stupid and fried that you just keep chowing down on all the bullshit phsychotropic drugs. OR one that gives you mental issues in the first place. THERE I SAID IT!!! Look if your going to let someone judge you on nothing that has any scientific evidence with drugs that they have no clue what they actually really do to you then guess what...maybe you are crazy. DO NO HARM does not apply to phsychiatry. They are money hungry script writing assholes who dont care about you. Try harder jerks.,Just like the rest. Time to try something that has no side effects and works. How about maybe even a cure for cancer? But wheres the money in that?,F,29,8  months300,5/24/2016,Abilify maintena kit
1, 2, occasionally missed daily dose,Bouncing off the walls first 48 hrs_ extremely hungry & eating all the time_ weight gain_ very talkative but no motivation.,WATCH OUT with the dosage. DO NOT start with 400 mg. The claim that the med 'slowly works its way thru your system' is INSANE. Monthly dose shud equal your daily dose x 30 days....period.,M,23,4  months400 mg 1X M,1/21/2016,Abilify maintena kit
