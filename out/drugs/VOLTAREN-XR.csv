0, 3, Knee pain,"Had a scary experience that I am associating with Voltaren.  Not completely convinced it was the RX but I have no other reason for the reaction.  First dosage I was hit with extreme abdominal issues including diarrhea.  Figured it was a lack of adequate food on board when I took the 1st dose so increased my meal before I took the 2nd dose.  Problem solved!  Was on the meds for 7 days when I experienced chest discomfort and upper abdominal pressure.  With a medical background_ I know that cardiac symptoms are mistaken for gastric reasons so I went to the ER.  Long story short_ I was diagnosed with severe gastric distress (GERD) and with a ""gastric cocktail"" and a high octane prilosec_ I had some serious relief and sent home.  Not convinced it was the issue_ I went a day without the RX and then started again.  I wasn't entirely 100% after taking the dose and now_ I am fairly certain it was the Voltaren.  I must say that my symptoms did improve within 3 days but the ER visit was",,M,47,7  days100 1X D,1/27/2012Email,Voltaren-xr
1, 2, Knee inflammation/ tendonitis,Serious stomach discomfort. Diarreha_ cramps_ gas_ bloating. It started about 10 day into my treatment. Around 4 hours after I took the pill (on a full stomach) the pain and diarreha would start. I stop treatment and went to an over-the-counter med.,The kneejoin paint stopped but the side effects were awful.,F,38,10  days100MG 1X D,8/20/2010,Voltaren-xr

3, 1, Anti-inflamitory for tooth ache,Psychosis_ stomach upset_ shaking.  Didn't make the connection until recently.  Got diagnosed bi-polar.  DO NOT USE.,This drug works by messing w/ your hormones and can be used as a mood stabilizer.  I have a family history of instability or eccentricity.  I have recurrent stomach problems and this drug upset my existing problems and was the catalyst for an all out break down. The doc. put me on seroquel after I was diagnosed bi-polar_ SO much worse than being crazy.  I've been off both medications and have returned to normal. This drug was casually prescribed as a pain reliever_ it had serious side efeects and would not use it if there is ANY alternative.  Take your ibuprofen.,M,27,8  days,12/11/2008Email,Voltaren-xr
4, 1, ,i notice there are a bunch of random ppl who gave the medicine a score of 5 without any explanation.  I wouldn't be surprised if that was the pharmological company trying to promote their medicine.  This drug is unsafe_ leads to blood clots (which casues strokes and heart attacks)_ upset stomach_ etc.  Asprin is safer and has less side effects,,F,,2  weeks,6/28/2008,Voltaren-xr
5, 1, Lower back pain,I was prescribed Voltaren-XR 100 MG for lower back pain.  It worked wonders for my pain - I thought that I had discovered a wonder drug - then after 30 days I was at work and started passing massive amounts of blood without pain or warning.  I thought I was bleeding to death!  I went to the ER and was admitted and had a colonoscopy the next day.  The Dr. discover an ulcer in by lower bowel which he believes was caused by the Voltaren.  The bleeding has now stopped and I am OK_ but I will never take this drug or any drug in it's class again.  Hindsight is 20-20.,,M,48,30  days,10/14/2007,Voltaren-xr

8, 2, L shoulder muscle tear,I took this medication for about 2 weeks. On day two I noticed a rash on the outside part of my left arm_ then the it spread to to my back and front of my neck by day three. I also noticed some dizziness_ bloated stomach_ gas_ and muscle weakness specially in my back. I had kidney pain on the right side to the point I could not bend forwad. I stoped taking this medication by the second week I was on it_ however it is taking me a while to get better from the weakness_ the rash is improving but my skin is stained with multiple brown dots.I would not recommend this medication.,,M,,2  weeks,5/16/2007,Voltaren-xr
