18, 1, high cholesterol and LDL,myalgia (muscle pain) in legs_ very heavy and tight feeling in calves and thighs_ initially thought it was in knee joints but turned out to be muscle pains,I thought it was arthritis and so did my cardiologist.  Finally saw a specialist who said muscle pains are common with statins_ especially at higher doses. He suggested stopping for several months_ not weeks.  I found medical journal articles that said incidence of myalgia is more like 5-15%_ not the 1-2% found in the literature that comes with the drugs.  My CK level was elevated but in normal range_ so my cardiologist did not believe it was the statin.  I also found journal articles that showed that the CK test can be NORMAL with mild to severe myalgia caused by statins.  (I fired my cardiologist!!)After I stopped Vytorin_ the pains disappeared after about 3 months.,M,64,6  months80/10 1X D,2/16/2010,Vytorin
