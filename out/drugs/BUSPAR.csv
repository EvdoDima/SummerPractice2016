Why didn't she stop taking the meds!??"" Because onset was slow_ and vaguely noticeable until I ran out of metamucil. Heh? See? Yep_ missed the early signs until it was too late. 2 weeks after stopping buspar_ am on blood pressure meds to induce excretion of liquid buildup/edema in muscles. I can move again and have energy. My anxiety is a little worse_ but frankly I would rather be tightly wound and cognizant_ than fatigued and apathetic. May work for some_ not for me.

4, 5, Anxiety/Panic Disorder,No side effects,Never did I imagine that Buspar would work so well.  I have tried many things for my panic attacks_ which was a daily battle.  Buspar was added partly to boost the lexpro I had been on for a few years and partly the hope of relieving panic/worry.  It made such an incredible difference I was really in shock.  Everything I read made is seem like it wouldn't do much.  But for me it was a miracle.,F,45,1  years10 mg 2X D,7/6/2016,Buspar

It made my anxiety and depression so much worse and improved absolutely nothing. I was supposed to take 2 pills a day but they always made me pass out an hour after taking it.

31, 2, Panic Disorder_ GAD,HORRIBLE nausea_ constipation_ dizziness_ pins and needles_ makes anti-depressant withdrawals 10x worse,Helps BRIEFLY_ for maybe 1 hour. But I can't eat anything without feeling sick_ and even without eating I feel sick. I have a phobia of vomit too_ so it's not helping my anxiety in that aspect at all. It's testing the limits of my Zofran. I've lost 6 pounds and I'm now underweight. Within the first 30 mins of taking it I often get dizzy spells and pins and needles that last 1-3 hours. It's bad because I can't really function in this state. It was worse when I was going through antidepressant withdrawals. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION IF YOU ARE GOING THROUGH ANTI-DEPRESSANT WITHDRAWALS!!! The symptoms of withdrawals are the same as the side effects of buspar so you will be miserable. I went up to 15mg twice a day briefly and the side effects just got worse. The first time I was on it I was on 10mg with Lexapro and I didn't feel anything except dizziness. Not a good medication.

37, 1, Anxiety,Bloating_ stomach pain_ paranoia and agoraphobia. Dizzyness_ disorientation_ light sensitivity. Nausea before and after meals.,I started on five mg twice a day. I had some side effects but the only one that bothered me was shaking and nervousness as each dose wore off. Once I increased to ten mg the shaking stopped but I became increasingly paranoid and my stomach started to react to everything I ate. I went back and forth between diahrea and constipation_ sometimes in the same day. The bloating and acid reflux were the worst. It made me look like I was pregnant. All in all it does not work for me. I have historically had bad reactions to medications like this and so I was really hoping this would work for me. But it doesn't. I am stepping down on my own before my check up appointment because it is effecting my ability to do my job. I also am a very physically active person and I haven't been able to run for three weeks because my discomfort is so great. I expect based on other reviews that it will take about a month to really reverse all of my symptoms while I step down gradually as is recommended. Note_ I do not recommend stepping down on your own_ unless you know how to do so safely_ and seeing a doctor as soon as possible once you choose to do so is highly recommended.,F,27,4  weeks10 mg x2,11/9/2015,Buspar

I wouldn't get out of bed unless it was for work and I would cry at the thought of leaving the house to go anywhere. I went to the doctor for a three week check up to see how my meds were doing_ and I had gained 11 pounds in those three weeks. The doctor has switched me to Zoloft now and it seems to be helping...I know buspar is great for some people_ and I was really hoping it would work for me considering it's one of the only anti anxiety medications that won't change your personality_ but unfortunately my experience with it was far from successful.,F,20,3  weeks10,8/15/2015Email,Buspar

Headaches lasted nearly all day. dizziness and nausea would fade after about 6 hours.,I know i was on a low dose_ but i really felt that buspar did not help much with my anxiety. i still had lots of panic attacks and nearly went to the hospital on multiple occasions. i just stopped taking it about a week and a half ago because i couldnt bear the headaches. i get migraines easily_ so these headaches morphed into migraines a lot. it may be a good medicine for others_ but it just did not sit well with my body. my body is very sensitive to side effects in general_ and its normal to have headaches and nausea the first 2-3 weeks taking it_ but 6 months in_ that should all be long gone. sorry_ buspar. didn't help much for me.,F,17,6  months20mg 1X D,7/14/2015,Buspar

It did not work for me_ just made symptoms worse especially after stopping the Klonopin. I went up in dosage after 3 weeks from 1x daily at bedtime to 1/2 pill after breakfast & lunch & 1 pill at bedtime_ this made the side effects increase dramatically.

56, 3, GAD_ Social Anxiety_ Bulimia,For the first 30 days I was prescribed 7.5mg of Buspar twice daily. This had no effect_ no side effects. Over the last week I have been taking 10mg twice daily. My Psych said she wants to begin aggressively treating my eating disorder as well and added zoloft 50 mg daily. (I cannot take amphetamines for my eating disorder due to previous addiction) I'm not 100% sure if it's the zoloft or the increased Buspar but I have had EXCRUCIATING headaches_ vivid dreams (which don't particularly bother me)_ sleeplessness_ nausea_ diarrhea which only lasted one day_ extreme irritability_ and increased purging.,My anxiety is slowly beginning to ease. After reading 500+ reviews_ I'm going to stick with it and hope for the best. Most reviews said that the side effects lessen after a few weeks.

I'm taking this along with Seroquel (200mg 50_50_100) and Welbutrin xl 300mg.  I began taking it at 30mg twice a day in January_ and upon my visit on April 1_ I was able to report that this addition had successfully helped a key component of my struggles--high anxiety for no reason and anticipation anxiety.Before being on buspar_ I had made significant gains with many of my bpd symptoms (anger_ frequent mood changes_ depression_ self harm etc).  But I had made very little gain in alleviating my anxiety until I began Buspar.  For the first time in a long time I am able to live a day at a time_ with no extreme anxiety over where things are going and what's down the road.  That's a freedom I have yet to experience in a long_ long time.  This combination has reduced my mood swings to general agitation and irritability_ and my psych seems to believe that increasing my dose to 60 will help with those symptoms and possibly help with sleep.,M,31,3  months60 (20 3x),4/2/2015Email,Buspar

Buspar gets a bad wrap mostly because people don't give it a chance to work (at least 30 days). It is NOT a benzo!! It doesn't offer instant relief.

63, 1, anxiety,in my 6th week_ i am not having a good time.  tho the morning anxiety has once again diminished_ the side effects are unpleasant.  i was also prescribed trazodone since buspar can cause sleep difficulties; i've always been a good sleeper until taking this med; now i must take an additional med if i am to continue buspar.  my body aches as if the anx. tension has left my CNS & relocated to my muscles.  normally a 'regular' person_ i am now looking at taking some type of laxative to combat constipation.  my eyes hurt_ my sinuses are giving me extra grief; i have put on a few pounds already_ feeling bloated & uncomfortable in my own skin.,after being on klonopin for several years_ i was forced to discontinue when i moved because the new clinic will not prescribe it.  weaning off of it was difficult_ but i managed - the new dr. prescribed buspar to replace it.  i understand klonopin is addictive but was well-monitored by my previous dr. & have no desire to abuse it.  so frustrating to have to find another med when i already had one working for me.,F,57,6  weeks10mg 2X D,3/10/2015Email,Buspar

66, 3, Social Anxiety Disorder,Some stomach pain_ increased appetite_ weight gain_ increased paranoia and fear around people. More fearful to leave my house.,I was trying this as a replacement for clonazepam for severe Social anxiety problems. I find that I'm more paranoid and fearful around people_ and I haven't left my house (due to fear) since I started taking it 5 days ago. I don't think this med is good for people with Social anxiety (b/c it increases fear and paranoia around people and going outside) but it may work for people who have other anxiety disorders_ such as Generalized anxiety or panic attacks. I am now trying to decide whether or not to give it the full 2 month trial or to stop taking it due to the increased paranoia I feel around people. It is harder to leave my house on this med than it is if I don't take this med. I also started cutting my hair short for no reason last night_ and now it looks terrible.,F,31,5  days5 mg 3X D,2/25/2015Email,Buspar

Depression after really bad relationship after the original divorce) (3rd. Depression from coping with second failed marriage_ PTSD from the abuse of a cheating spouse_ and a failed reconciliation) Celexa royally screwed me up.  Most recently...1.5 years ago generic Effexor.  Had no emotion when my grandmother died.  Dropped it cold turkey and regret the three weeks of hell I went through.  Out of the blue started waking up with panic attacks_ went to the Dr. and we settled on this due to the multiple stresses in my life.  Got to the point I would wake up around 3am and not go back to sleep.  This resolved the issue...except when a new stress was added I had sleeping issues for several days.  Was at the Dr. today and we agreed to try 12.5 as opposed to the 10 mg. per dose.  Will see what happens...,M,47,90  days10mg 2X D,1/20/2015Email,Buspar

The second week I experienced dizziness_ lightheadedness_ jitters_ trouble falling asleep as I entered into week three I felt a lot better. My thoughts have lessened although I am waiting to see the doctor so he can raise my dosage I feel I need a bit more since at times when my time of the month is approaching I get a bit agitated physically and emotionally. Weight gain has been an issue I have to watch what I eat while taking this med but for me its worth it since I do feel better. I can actually go to the doctor now and take my BP whereas before just the site of the BP machine would make my BP go through the roof. I took this med for severe anxiety whereas I was feeling weak_ palpitations all day every day and the constant worrying would not allow me to function.

These brief dizzy spells lasted 2 seconds on average_ but they were recurring.

83, 5, GAD,vivid dreams_ wake up 2 hours early_ irritable_ increase appetite,My side effects are actually very minimal. I can go to sleep easily_ just wake up a bit early but I'm not tired. About an hour after I take it I feel very tired_ but since I work from home I can have a 20 minute rest and then all is OK when I get up. My anxiety is already better_ but I am still very irritable. I'm looking forward to that being curbed by the medicine after a while hopefully. I am supposed to go up to 10 mg 2x a day and may do that soon. This medicine is way better than an SSRI for me. It has increased my libido a bit which I didn't think would ever be possible. I have realized I need to control my eating or it will go through the roof so I have started keeping a large cup of water with me while I work and some gum_ which helps. This is all much better than being anxious all the time. I realized it had started working when I belly laughed at something my 5-year-old did and I shocked myself a little. I hadn't freely laughed like that in so long_ I couldn't remember. It is nice to relax and experience life again.,F,42,7  days5 2X D,10/22/2014,Buspar
84, 1, Anxiety,No side effects at first - thought all was great.  About 2 weeks ago I noticed that shortly after taking my dose I could not stop eating - it was completely out of control and I would only stop when I was so full I was in pain.  About 10 days ago my vision went blurry and it didn't help even with my glasses.  A week  ago intense neck pain began and nothing relieved it.  Two days later I was almost crippled by intense muscle and joint pain and made the connection with Buspar.  Stopped taking it immediately and feel better already.

85, 5, anxiety,I started out on 7.5 MG a day for a few weeks to keep the side effects minimal as possible. Still got a little dizzy. Now I take 20 MG a day. 10 in the morning and 10 in the evening. That has knocked out about 80% of my anxiety. First week you will get dizzy from it and not sleep as well. I would go to bed about 1 in the morning and wake up at 3 am feeling fully rested and take about an hr to get back to bed. Takes a couple weeks to get over the insomnia. Felt depressed at first also until my body adjusted. It took about two months to fully kick in. I still haven't tried my wellbutrin yet because I'm nervous about the energy kick it gives you and it increases anxiety. I also have ativan to counter it. Either way give it enough time to work. This medicine does not work in a couple days like some of the reviews I read. It has to build up in your system. Don't be discouraged early.

86, 5, Anxiety,After switching doctors_ I had my new doctor to try me out on this medication. As_ I wanted to taper off of taking Xanax (which was prescribed for me to take 4 times a day) and only begin taking it as needed. I have been taking this medication for a month and half thus far. I am on the lowest dosage that they offer_ as I consider myself to have a sensitive stomach and alot of pills don't sit well with my stomach at all. I do take this medication with food_ just like I do with most pills that I take. When I first started taking these pills_ I did get these random bouts of dizziness_ it would actually cause my body to suddenly start feeling anxious for no reason.And_ I did experience bouts of nausea as well. Because I regularly take Phenergan (Promethazine Syrup)_ for the motion sickness and vertigo that I suffer from_ I was able to take that and it really helped with alleviating the nausea and  dizziness.The longer that I have been taking these pills_ the more the side effects have real,,F,,46  days5mg 2X D,10/16/2014Email,Buspar
87, 4, anxiety,Some drowsiness_ chest pains_ headaches,This is not my first time taking Buspar. I was on it for about 4 or 5 months a couple of years ago. It seemed to have no effect on my anxiety at all until 6 weeks after taking it. I wasn't expecting it to work because it didn't work for 6 weeks and my anxiety was worse than ever. But then I suddenly realized I was feeling super_ super calm. And I realized that it had started to work. I highly recommend anyone who is taking it take it at least 7-8 weeks. Sometimes it just takes that long to work. And boy did it work! I have never been so calm and relaxed ever before in my life or since. It didn t give me a buzz or high. I just felt soooooo calm and relaxed. I kept thinking that it must be what heaven is like. After years and years of terrible anxiety I was finally rid of it. I was so happy. I thought my anxiety was gone for good. All I had to do was keep taking it. But after 2 or 3 months it stopped working. I was upset and tried everything. Increasing the dose_ taking it with and without food_ in combination with Zoloft_ etc. I have heard taking it in combination with Zoloft or other certain antidepressants makes it more effective and maybe it did at first_ But it never worked again. Now today years later I still have anxiety and my dr. has prescribed it to me again_ hoping that since it worked so well for a while the last time_ it will help me again. This time I feel a bit spacey_ have headaches and chest pains and a little drowsiness. I hope it works again.,F,41,2  weeks10 mg 3X D,9/27/2014Email,Buspar
88, 3, Anxiety/ Panic attacks,I started this medication 3 times a day within the first week_ but that was just too difficult so now I'm taking it twice a day. When I first started it my anxiety was calmer_ BP was normal and i felt relaxed_ I maybe had a panic attack once I woke up from a full 5 hour sleep_ but that wasn't alarming to me. I'm almost three weeks in and it feels like my anxiety is coming back or worsening.  My side effects: random chest pains_ light headedness_  headache_ excitement_ palpitations_ increased libido_ increased appetite_ restlessness_ euphoria ( everything gets bright ) So you all are not alone in this. Now_ I'm going to tucker this out because I do feel that these effects will subside_ plus I was on 10mg lexapro before and it made me feel horrible.. but it's just scary waking up in almost a full panic when you got at least a good 4 hours of sleep_ Or having anxiety after you eat.

89, 3, Anxiety,Have been on it for 3 weeks_ low dose of 5 mg once a day. I do feel calmer but it's side effects are wrecking havoc on all aspects of my life. I feel very spacey_ out of it most all day- worse if on empty stomach- so eating half banana and half Pb sandwhich when I take it. The lightheadness and nausea are the worst_ especially at work . I have a computer desk job and this lightheadness affects me to point that my anxiety kicks in and leaves me crying because of it. Thank god i have a very understanding boss _co workers and family. But still I get tired of feeling this way most days than not . I too am hoping lightheadness _ nausea _ headaches_ neck tension go away soon. It is affecting my life outside of work_ hardly go out shopping_ out to eat at restraurants and stopped driving because of this lightheadness that lasts most of the day _ worse if sitting for long periods in front of a computer.. But that's my job .. So no you all are not alone. Faith in god that he will soon make it better helps but just saying for me .,,F,43,3  weeks5mg once,9/20/2014,Buspar

Effexor_ Prozac_ celexa_ Wellbutrin_ Ativan_ nuerontin_ topamax_ trazadone_ halcyon_ desipramine_...over a period of 20 years.  This is the first medication that I've taken that has calmed... Eliminated my anxiety_ without doping me to sleep.  I have read ratings and opinions on this website for years and have used this forum as a deciding factor on whether or not to try a medication.  All I can say is that I am experiencing a side of myself I never new possible. I take on tasks without the urgency to finish and move on to the next thing ASAP.

108, 5, Anxiety,minor dizziness after taking_ occasional muscle twitches_ increased hunger after doses (minor weight gain). These side effects were extremely mild compared to the other medications I have tried.,"Looking back those first few weeks were pretty ""scary""_ lots of tingling waves going through my body.  I was in the midst of serious anxiety_ could barely leave the house.  I had tried Paxil_ and the horrible ""brain zaps"" I got from those few weeks were hell.  My doc was skeptical Buspar would even work for me_ and he prescribed Xanax .50 with it as he did with the Paxil_ but unlike with the Paxil_ I rarely had to augment the Buspar with Xanax.  In the 13+ years I've been on Buspar_ I've been prescribed Celexa_ Lexapro_ and Xanax.  Buspar without a doubt has been the most tolerable and pleasant.  It keeps me ""right in the middle""_ not too up or down_ not too anxious or angry.  I haven't tried to stop taking it_ and my doc says it's an ""orphan drug"" so they will never improve it.  It supposedly isn't meant to be taken long term_ and I've read ""articles"" where some people actually think it is a placebo.

The stresses in my life are still there and unresolved_ but I can cope with them_ and I feel SO MUCH BETTER.  That being said_ it was not a great two weeks of adjustment.  For three or four days_ about a week into it_ the anxiety was actually increasing.  The physical symptoms: that escalating spine tension_ the racing heart_ the zero-to-sixty panic--there were a few times when I felt those symptoms when there was just no reason for it--there was a physical anxiety manifestation with no emotional cause. A bizarre feeling.  And worse_ there was an incident where there was an emotional cause_ and the reaction was so magnified and out of proportion that it was unlike anything that had come before--almost out of control.  That has all passed (hopefully for good)_ but the anxiety amplification was bad. Very.,F,47,14  days10 mg 3X D,9/27/2012,Buspar
165, 5, Anxiety,"Let me just start of by saying- I hate taking drugs! Ugh. So i have debated and tried so many. Hated everything I took- lexapro_ welbutrin and a few others. But when I started to get full blown panic attacks from my anxiety I knew I had to stop being a baby and try something and stick to it. Then I got the Buspar. Since I'm a pill phob_ I break my 7.5 my in half. So I really am only taking 3.25 twice a day. It's great. I tried a full pill once and I was too much in a dream state. I want to feel like me! If the Buspar is making u dizzy or tired_ your my are way too high!!! Omg I saw some on here for 30 mg???? I'd be in a damn comatose!! And I'm not tiny. I'm 5'3"" 160lbs. Go low! This stuff is great. I'd give it a 5 but it's only been a few days. Now mind you_ I tried this on and off for about 2 months (remember_ I'm a drug weirdo!) but anxiety was so bad I knew I couldn't control it myself. And it's great for depression too! Just try a low LOW dosage. You'll see the difference. Trust me- I hate them all. This is the only one that works! Best of luck to you all.

I got extremely light-headed_ it was ridiculous. I tried to read a book and couldn't even focus on the page because everything felt like it was spinning and I couldn't even see the page properly. I'd also get these insane head rushes that would come on suddenly and disappear in a few seconds. It was so uncomfortable that I had to sit down after taking it to make sure I didn't fall down and hurt myself. I thought maybe these side effects would go away_ but they never did and after eight days I finally gave up and told my doctor I wasn't taking it any more.,M,27,8  days10 MG 1X D,9/13/2012Email,Buspar

I'm sleeping better than I have in a long time. I also noticed that I don't worry as much as I used to. I still worry about some things_ but it is much easier to pull out of what used to turn into a huge downward spiral.

171, 4, Anxiety_ Panic Attacks,Sometimes get dizzy after I take.  I also notice that working on things like a computer or iPad can intesify the effect.  Other thing that bothers me is forgetfullness.  I don't know if that is the drug_ me or a combination.  I am a Type A_ pragmatic_ driven individual.  My mind always races from one thought to the next_ next task_ next job.  Even in the past I would forget one thing because I had already moved onto the next thing in my mind.  I don't think I even realized it was happening in the past_ but on the medication suddenly I have become cognizant of it.  Kind of weird and not sure what to make of it.,I had never had any prior medical conditions related to anxiety or depression.  However_ due to a very stressful business (I own my business) I started having severe panick attacks and anxiety and I was not sleeping at all.  This went on for months.  I was exhausted_ and I was at my wits end_ so I finally went to my doctor.  He explained fully Buspar_ etc... and with some reluctance on my part he prescribed it to me.  There is no doubt that it helped me.  He see's me every 90 days.   We discuss dosage until I got to my current level.  I'm a pretty big guy having played sports so I am on 10mg x 3d.  On the Buspar I felt more relaxed and at ease and things that typically bothered me seemed to suddenly seem less relevant to my day.  I didn't find myself getting worked up_ or agitated as easily_ and I am not as quick tempered.  My problem is that I don't want to be on something long term.  I tried to ween myself down and have actually gone off cold turkey twice.  What I found was not necessarily a return of anxiety when I did this but that I get agitated and irritable very easy.  This was a trait I had prior to the medication_ but now I actually realize it is happening where in the past I didn't even know I was acting that way.  It was just my personality.  I catch myself being very short and abrupt with my wife and kids.  Not aggressive or physical but just less tolerant eand easy going.  My patience declines.

172, 4, anxiety,45 mins-1 1/2 hrs. after taking I feel dizzy_ and sleepy. I notice this more when I take it in the morning.,I've been dealing with anxiety for about 5 years and never really did anything until now. I'm not one to take pills...especially ones for mental type health. My doctor started me off on 5mg twice a day for 3 days and gradually upped it so I'll be taking 30mg a day. I didn't have any side effects at first. Once I hit about 20mg per day I started feeling dizzy about 45 mins after I would take it. It seems worse in the morning and when I would up the dosage. I'm hoping once I'm on a steady dosage the side effects will go away. This medication has helped a lot in the 2 weeks I've been taking it. I'm in college and just sitting in class would spike my anxiety sometimes. Classes start tomorrow so I have my fingers crossed that this medication will do the trick and I can hopefully relax while I'm in class and focus on the subject and not my anxiety. My only regret is that I didn't do something sooner to deal with my anxiety.,F,21,2  weeks 2X D,9/4/2012Email,Buspar

I haven't really had issues except for being tired all the time..... I wish I could take them both at night cause I'd sleep fantastic! after I take it for about a half an hour I'll feel a little dizzy and have to lie down until it goes away. I do have weird/bad dreams here and there but if you knew the dreams i was having before you would know these arent a big issue and most of these people would be like oh these arent a big deal lol all and all it doesnt take away all my anxiety but it sure takes that awful edge off also have been a cutter since age 8 and havent even felt the want or need since ive been on this medication which is an AMAZING thing. I have noticed a little memory loss and sometimes confusion it isnt horrible but for sure noticeable. like not being able to remember my voice mailbox passcode..... i mean really? ive had it for,all and all I would recommend this to someone with anxiety but I would advise to make sure and take it everyday because there is withdrawal and if you haven't had a panic attack and you stop this suddenly without weening yourself off first you most likely will I know many other people on Buspar which is how I found out about it! :) I hope everyone finds something that helps if this doesn't!,F,28,5  weeks10mg 2X D,8/21/2012Email,Buspar

I would say a word similar to the word I thought I wanted to say_ but would not be aware of what I had said wrong_ unless someone brought it to my attention_ like_ ""Put the milk in the dishwasher."" Then I started writing wrong. Writing words with letters in the wrong order. I do have dyslexia_ but this was new for me. Also_ it's impossible to make it through the day without sleeping and my sex drive is in the crapper. The medicine is going in the trash.

At about 5:30 the next morning I had a severe panic attack with more tremors and chest pain. I went to the ER it was so bad.

The effect is really quite dramatic and if I sweep my eyes across a room it feels like my head is being rolled down a gravel road.  Very disconcerting.  Very_ VERY vivid dreams.,Dizzyness is one of my panic triggers so this is a major drawback for this med_ for me.  I find I feel like I need MORE klonapin when taking the buspar just to combat the panic from the dizziness.  I'm playing with the dose_ breaking the pills in 1/2_ etc_ to see if I can find something that works.  Because_ in a very preliminary way_ I can kinda feel like it is easier to dismiss negative thought spirals.

198, 3, Pure O_ Panic_ PMDD,So Ive been on it for two months and I just emailed my dr this week about the newer symptoms. I had just seen her about 3 weeks ago since i ended up in the ER with chest pains that felt nothing like a panic attack. It was and still is a shocking type pain_ not palpitations or heavy beating like I use to have. Ive also developed some blurry vission and headaches along with the tingling in my extremities. I feel like my ears also drain when I lay back and itch so badly i want to jam qtips in them just to sleep at times. I do_ however fall asleep without even thinking now a days. I definately like that_ and my dr told me it would get worse in the first few days before it got better. So true. I alsmost ran down my block after the 2nd or 3rd day on it because my panic attack was so bad but luckily my fiance was prepared and after shaking and thnking I was going to die_ it didnt happen again. But that may have been the worst ever. Imediately the following day I was feeling great and I wanted,This was something that just started after my miscarriage as well as the severe panic.  I was on a roll.  But then_ I had a very bad mental confrontation that made me withdraw for about 4 days with panic.  I keep taking the meds but i havent been right since.  Im shakey all day and nervous and panic is around the corner most times now.  Any pain I feel I think I have a blood clot and its the big one.  I keep flexing my muscles until I realize I need to relax and if I do while Im sitting still Ill fall almost immidiately to sleep.  I dont really think I feel depressed and it is PMDD time but everything is just not right right now.  I may need to up it a little bit because i still have the mental clarity and my sex drive is still up unlike before_ I may be able to deal with everything else because its generally mild but the chest pain has to go!  Also_ when I smoke pot now i have to smoke VERY slow (and almost un enjoyful) because Ive been panicking since the first day I started the meds.  I was only panicing when I wasnt smoking_ not I just panic anytime.  Really sucks because the pot acts like a muscle relaxer i would usually smoke in the tub rught before bed_ now Im afraid I will drown so I smoke in the bed most nights before I sleep.  When I smoke slower i dont get as high but I still get sleepy.  I didnt get dry mouth either but now I do and as far as gaining wieght_ Im loosing because I dont have an apitite anymore since i dont smoke as much during the day now.,F,32,2  months10MG 2X D,3/27/2012EmailHistory,Buspar

I have had GAD and Panic Disorder for 16 years and was managing it with xanax_ which was fine for anxiety and panic_ but caused my SAD and put me in a depressive shell. Buspar works like a charm for my general anxiety_ it stops the worry choo choo train in its tracks. Stopping the worrying prevents 99.9% of the panic attacks_ but when they do occur_ a small amount of benzo stops the panic. 60mg was too much_ but 45mg seems to be the magic dosage for me.

There is no such thing as a magic pill_ managing any condition is  best accomplished from all fronts. The only issue is a huge decrease in libido and some impotence_ however I am also coming off of 300mg of Welbutrin that I took for over a year for depression with minimal benefit_ and I am hoping the interaction of the two is what is causing the sexual side effects.Basically_ in layman's terms_ Buspar gave me my balls back.

Its not bad its something i can deal with because the Buspar has helped me so much. since taking It I no longer have anxiety_ my thoughts have slowed and I'm able to think clearly_ and I have gone from clinically depressed to mild depression.  I'm only seventeen I started out on 5mg 2 xD and every month my doctor has increased the dosage and milligram due to when my body gets use to the level of drug in my system it seems to wear off.,M,17,3  months10 mg 2X D,2/3/2012Email,Buspar
211, 5, GAD and social anxiety,"Dizzy 30 min after taking it the first time. Each subsequent time the dizziness was greatly reduced. I take it before bed and late morning with food to help with that side effect. I thought I was going crazy with my anxiety. I had it all say and night along with negative_ repetitive racing thoughts. I even was doing some OCD things like counting the hours on the clock repetitively and keeping three different calendars and over visualizing time. I guess I was hanging on by a thread and knowing I made it through another day was a big accomplishment. After my first dose of 10mg buspar I cried. Not because it made me feel awful but because I finally had relief in my brain from all those irrational buzzing thoughts I couldn't stop until now! Also my muscles felt less tense. I always had a kink in my neck from tensing up the muscles in my shoulders and neck from the anxiety. Also my ""tension headaches"" went away because I wasn't constantly furrowing my brow. I know this doesn't work for every one. And I'm sorry that it doesn't because I would only wish that we could all feel this kind of relief from our anxiety like I did. I think it's best if you haven't been on benzos consistently and if you have GAD or social anxiety disorder. For me_ it's been the answer to my prayers. I'm happy to wake up in the morning and get my day started. I'm happy about the future and life in general. Most of all I'm relieved that I don't have to live like that anymore.",,F,33,6  days20mg,2/2/2012Email,Buspar

Inability to sleep.  Inability to think clearly.  Worst feeling I have ever felt.  Much worse than panic attack.  Felt I would certainly die if I continued taking this drug.,I had been taking Xanax for about 8 years until a new doctor put me on this drug.  The Xanax totally controlled my panic disorder and was controlling my high blood pressure caused by the panic attacks_ but this doctor did not believe panic disorder existed.  He put me on Buspar.  After I told him the side effects I was having_ he told me to double the dose. I did not think this was a good idea since I already felt like the drug was killing me_ so I immediately found a psychiatrist who specializes in panic disorder and he told me to stop taking Buspar immediately because it was the exact opposite of what I needed for my condition.  I stopped the Buspar and I felt better right away and within 3 days all the side effects stopped after it got out of my system.  The psychiatrist put me back on Xanax and I have had no problems since.,F,45,7  days 1X D,1/28/2012,Buspar

218, 4, Anxiety,Slight dizziness and brain fog for about an hour when I took 10mg_ so I dropped back to 5mg.  I think I need lower dose_ but more often_ still experimenting.  Very slight increase in thirst_ but its Summer here and it suddenly got hot..... so that's rather inconclusive.,I first tried Buspar a couple of years ago when I was going through some unavoidable stressful events.  I don't like taking xanax_ even though it works the best for anxiety_ because of its addictive potential.  Buspar helped to take the edge off my anxiety then and its helping again now_ not like xanax does_ not an instant complete relief of all anxiety_ but for me a safer acceptable alternative.  Some slight initial relief_ but it does take a few weeks to reach its potential.Apparently_ this only works for some people_ I must be one of those people.  Research suggests it has something to do with malfunctioning or insufficient serotonin receptors.  I suppose if that's not your cause of too much anxiety_ then this medication wont help.  SSRI's don't work for me_ so I guess I have enough serotonin_ its just not doing its job properly.On a side note.... I've noticed that while taking Buspar_ my ADD meds (stimulants) seem to work better and last longer.  I dont get a sudden drop in mood like I normally do_  I only need to take half dose and not as often.... which is great because I don't like having to take stimulants to function like 'normal' people_ so less is better.,F,49,3  weeks5mg 3X D,12/30/2011,Buspar

That was too much at once. I take my welbutrin when i wake up_ and then take the Buspar about 5-6 hours later when the welbutrin seems to kick in. This is working really good. I am not depressed (welbutrin) or anxious (buspar).I would take this on a full stomach so the dizziness and lightheadedness is minimized.

I have never any health issues in my life & I started having panic attacks (out of the blue) so bad I thought I was going out of my freakin mind. I would get them mainly while driving it was getting to the point that I was afraid to drive. I am a very healthy male that doesn't take any kind of meds. I did a lot of research & didn't want to take any type of Benzo's_ so I tried Buspar. Because of the side effects I had read about_ I told my doc I wanted to start at a very low dosage & see how it goes. Yes_ I did feel a bit foggy for a few days just after taking it_ but_ NO MORE PANIC ATTACKS! I also found that taking it with food negated any stomach issues. I now experience no side effects at all & am panic free. For you that have panic attacks_ I know the misery. Please give this med a try starting at a very low dosage & GIVE IT SOME TIME! I would happily be foggy minded for a few minutes a day_ for a few days_ to not have panic attacks again.    I see a lot of people give this med a bad rap. They seem to be from people that never take it past day one because of side effects. Personally_ I think prescribed dosage amounts are possibly too high. I think many people give up after a day or two because of negative side effects. I take just 5MG twice a day & all is good.

I usually would just take an ativan if i felt panicky_ which had no side effects and only made me feel good. **Note* ive only been taking this for two days_ i know. this isnt quite enough time to judge a drug_ but two days is more than enough. i do not feel like myself and the dizziness is the worst thing. i now see that im not alone with this symptom.,glad i saw this and no that im not making this up! my dad thinks its my anxiety and not the drug...but i know that i never felt this way until i started. im done.,F,18,2  days10mg 2X D,5/3/2011Email,Buspar

I went to the doctor and she told me I could take 2 pills at once because my dosage was very low_ I said_ definately not_ if 7.5 in the morning make me feel this horrible_ imagine doubling the dosage_ no way. I am getting off this drug. I was taking Valium which to me is a wonderful drug_ no side effects_ I can sleep at nite and no anxiety during the day. I dont recommend this drug to anyone!!,I dont understand after reading most of the comments from other patients why they prescribe this poison to anyone.

Up to 45mins to 1Hr after my afternoon dose I became hot_ sweaty and in a ""fog"" and tinglie all over and wanted to eat any and everything not nailed down.(even after eating lunch!)My afternoon ""hot flashes"" usually occured at work. However my 9:30pm dose drove me to the refridgerator. I ate and ate and ate. I had no signal from my brain telling me I was full. I gained 15 pounds within a year. And of course our great medical staff had NO clue....no wonder. As long as they didnt have the problem_ so what. I have cut down my dose however my anxiety and obsessions started to reoccur. I am still trying to find the correct dose. Perhaps its time for my care(less) giver to try something else!!!",,F,49,6  years30mg 3X D,4/4/2011Email,Buspar
259, 1, panic attacks,i began taking buspar a couple of weeks ago because i was having extreme panic attacks after my brother committed suicide.  at first_ it felt as though it was having a therapeutic effect--i could drive_ eat_ sleep_ and essentially relax.  i began tapering down the dose a few days ago_ and then on friday i decided i wanted to stop taking it altogether.  BAD IDEA.  initially the drug gave me a few unpleasant side effects--blurred vision_ shakiness_ headache.  but this was completely different.  i had the worst panic attack of my life with hallucinations_ palpitations_ brain zaps_ uncontrollable shivering_ inability to sit still_ chest pain_ inability to communicate_ feeling of unreality--i felt as though i was going crazy.  i was up all night_ and the only way i was able to get some of this to subside was to take a half a pill.  they say this crap is supposed to be non-addictive...my ass.  the withdrawal effects for me were worse than the side effects!  so now i am trying to wean myself,this drug induces panic attacks_ not cure them.,F,28,2  weeks7.5mg 2X D,3/27/2011,Buspar

Now I'm on 100 mg Zoloft and 30 mg Buspar and it's done wonders for me.  I was almost hyperventilating due to the severe anxiety prior to taking this combination.  I was also becoming afraid of going outside prior to taking this medication.  Now I'm very calm.  I do occasionally feel some anxiety but it is quite manageable.  It hasn't helped much with the ptsd though.,F,39,14  days15 mg 2X D,3/21/2011,Buspar
261, 4, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD),Nausea_ Tingling/Numbness in mouth and eyes_ fatigue (no side effects after 2-3 weeks),Buspar has helped lower my anxiety greatly_ however_ my doctor had to increase my dose up to 60mg/daily (30mg twice per day)_ the maximum allowable dose_ as the lower doses seemed to stop working after 2-4 weeks. At 60mg day_ I feel next to anxiety free. The side effects I experienced from Buspar have dissipated_ and only came back when I upped the dose for a few weeks before disappearing altogether again. In particular_ Buspar has helped me substantially with public speaking... Although I still suffer from some anxiety when speaking publicly_ I no longer get the strong physical sensations I used to get. I have added Xanax 0.25mg (the lowest dose) as needed when I am in a situation that requires a lot of public speaking. I strongly recommend Buspar_ GIVE IT TIME! It may take a month or longer for you to experience the benefits of this drug! It does NOT work overnight like the benzos (Xanax/Valium/Klonopin_ etc)....,M,21,4  months30mg 2X D,3/16/2011,Buspar

It takes a couple of weeks to really kick in_ but it does help with anxiety. Not as much help as I would like_ but it does take away some of it. The side effects have made me switch to another medication. I would twitch randomly_ and after 4 weeks_ I felt sore in places that would otherwise be normal. I also have heard of possible hair loss. I don't enjoy taking one medication more than once a day (Buspar is taken two or three times a day).

270, 1, GAD,Induced panic attacks; did not help with anxiety,Wish I could give this a zero_ because it ruined my life for about six months. I was prescribed buspar for Generalized Anxiety Disorder that was troubling but not debilitating. After a couple of months_ when nothing had improved_ my doctor started raising the dosage. Shortly after_ I began having panic attacks daily. I had never experienced a panic attack before the buspar. Doc told me to keep taking it_ which I did for several more months_ becoming agoraphobic and unable to eat in the process. Lost 15 pounds_ rarely slept_ and never left my house. An EMT who showed up at my house (I thought I was having a heart attack) told me buspar was bad news & I wasn't the first person he'd seen have panic attacks on it. Got off the buspar and the panic attacks slowly subsided. Worst medication I have ever been on.,F,34,4  months30mg 1X D,2/10/2011,Buspar

Better with food than without.  May take several trials with your doc to get the right dosage --- report any extreme symptoms i.e. nausea_ dizziness_ extreme sleepiness or fatigue_ as this may be a sign over serotonin syndrome.,Doesn't have the instant properties of benzos_ but if you remain on benzos too long_ tapering and getting off them is really hard.

275, 2, Anxiety,Buspar_ like any psychiatric medicine_ can cause harm as well as good.  There is no doubt that Buspar helped with my rumination. However in combination with an SNRI and then an SSRI_ Buspar (or more likely the combined impact of the medications on my serotonin receptors) caused anxiety_ panic attacks_ agitation and akathesia. I also experienced a very strange and uncomfortable feeling in my arms - like an extreme state of hair-standing-on-end fear pushing me into panic.  I was overmedicated.  This varied in intensity over 6 months_ and because I suffer from GAD_ it was VERY hard to figure out that the medications were exacerbating symptoms that my psychiatrist believed were due to my underlying illness.  Once I reduced the Buspar_ my symptoms completed resolved within 24 hours (a sure sign of serotonin toxicity).  The combination of these meds is uncharted and unstudied territory_ and one need be aware that Psychiatrists are often making semi-educated guesses. Be aware of yourself and,I was prescribed Buspar for GAD_ and the drug_ in combination with an SNRI_ then an SSRI_ caused the very symptoms it was meant to treat.,M,38,6  months20mg 2X D,1/19/2011,Buspar

Although it doesn't knock my socks off like Xanax as far as removing tension/anxiety it does seem to preform quite well as an alternative source of help instead of the benzodapine class of drugs. According to my reading there seems to be no development of tolerance to the drug_ with Xanax I had to keep upping the dose to get the same affect_ so this is good.

281, 5, Anxiety_ Panic Attacks,I had a lot of dizziness and nausea within 15 minutes of taking the morning dose.  With the evening dosage_ I had very vivid dreams at night_ and even some nightmares.,"I have always been a ""worry wart"" by nature_ suffering from intestional and stomach upset_ a feeling of fear_ and a ""racing"" heart every time I was facing a stressful situation or decision.  I never realized I was suffering from anxiety until I had my first panic attack in my late 40's.  Initially I took this medication twice a day_ once in the morning and once at night.  I got too dizzy with the morning meds_ even when reducing the dosage_ so I just took it at night.  The night dose caused vivid dreams_ which my doctor said would diminish after my body got adjusted to the medication.  I now take it only once a day_ before going to bed_ with no ill side effects and the vivid dreams have stopped.  Taking it at night also helps me relax so I can get to sleep.  I did not feel immediate relief when starting Buspar.  It took a few weeks before I began to feel calmer and relaxed in my day-to-day life.  It also took a while for my doctor to figure out what dosage worked best for me.  I still sometimes experience occasional_ but milder_ symptoms of anxiety when I am worried about something or am in a stressful situation_ but have not had a panic attack since starting this medication.  I tried to wean myself off of it once_ but when my late husband got sick and the severe anxiety started to come back_ I went back on the medication.  I've taken it ever since.

282, 5, Anxiety,mild dizziness right after taking it...goes away in 15 minutes,So far I have had a good experience with this drug.  It has way fewer side effects than the SSRIs.  I had a HORRIBLE experience with both Prozac and Zoloft--they fixed my anxiety but were too strong of anti-depressants.  They gave me insomnia and had me bouncing off the walls_ jittery_ and irritable.  Buspar is NOT an antidepressant_ so it works well for people who have anxiety but aren't depressed.  I have also taken Xanax a few times when I had bad panic.  Xanax is definitely stronger and works more quickly_ but is addictive.  I am happy with Buspar on a daily basis.  It takes about 2-3 weeks to get into your system and really start to work.  It hasn't cured my anxiety completely_ but it's decreased it by about 50%.  I feel more calm and content and my anxiety is now managable.  For a 50% improvement with basically no side effects_ this drug is a winner.,F,28,4  weeks10 mg 2X D,12/4/2010,Buspar

I find that already_ I am not worrying so much.  I don't like the brain zaps and I hope those will go away.  I had a really bad time getting off paxil about 10 years ago and I remember the brain zaps were the worst part. These are a little bit different than those but I still don't like it.

I dont take any other meds except pain meds/muscle relaxers for unrelated condition.  I am hesitant to take SSRI or SSNRI so wanted to try this 1st. I am usually very sensitive to meds so started off at 5mg 2x day and worked my way up. Still havent reached the rx'd 15mg 3X/day.  My pharmacist and receptionist at dr's office recommended it b/c they both take it. I agree that it helps with  anxiety_ even though I have only taken it for 10 days. 1 p.a in 10 days is better. I dont think I can deal with the insomnia (woke up at 3AM today) and Ive had the strangest dreams. I rarely remember dreams and Ive had them every night (I could sleep) I usually take it right when I wake up and it makes me dizzy and one morning gave me a day long BAD headache. Could be from clenching my jaws_ which I did before but is much worse now. My stomach problems haven't gone away_ but have been noticeably better. I have a typical type A personality and this doesn't help me ""calm down"" or focus which I was hoping it would. Altho it has reduced the freq of panic attacks_ I think Id rather take Imodium and xanex as needed for PAs.  I dont see how people take this at nite.Will prob discus SSNRI w/dr this week and see if he thinks I should change and get something to help me sleep.I would strongly suggest slowly inc.dose to dec. dizziness.

I do experience ringing in my ears sometimes as well as brain zaps but it hasen't been so bad that I felt I needed to discontinue use.  I noticed many of the negative feedback comments are coming from people that only took it for a few days or weeks and at very low doses.

308, 3, Anxiety,Dizziness 15 minutes after taking it. Some fatigue and not sure if some depression. Helped with anxiety.,"This has helped me with some side effects. My doctor started me off VERY slowly since I am extremley sensistive to meds and was petrified to take this_ but my anxiety had rocketed out of control. He started me on 2.5 mg per day_ working up to current 15mg. I can't take all 15mg at once_ so I take 5 mg. when I start breakfast_ 5mg. when I'm done with breakfast and 5mg. at lunch. My doc advised me not to take it too late in the day since_ for me_ it got me sort of ""revved up"" and it was hard for me to sleep. I still don't sleep very well_ but I have noticed this has taken me back to my ""normal anxious"" self. I'll never be a laid back person_ but this has allowed me to feel more like myself. Perimenopause has really affected me in so many ways_ and one of them was having my anxiety go off the charts. I have noticed some weight gain_ but not sure if this is due to Buspar or menopause. On occassion I take a half a Xanax if my anxiety is really off the charts. Nothing is as effective for me as Xanax_ but I'm very wary of being on that for any extended period of time. Was on Xanax when this all started for about a month and was getting rebound anxiety. None of my docs are fans of Xanax except for true situational reasons for very_ very short periods of time.",F,50,365  days5mg 3X D,8/21/2010,Buspar
309, 5, GAD,weird numb/electric feeling in face_ lips and hands at first and sometimes now if I somehow double my dose- this feeling was helped by breaking the doses up.  Headache and some blurry vision at first and sometimes when I forget a dose.,"Helps my GAD immensely.  Can't say enough good things.  Just woke up in the middle of the night with that ""pit of stomach"" fear feeling that I get- took 5mg and am now feeling quite sane and unafraid.  Even after all this time I'm amazed at how this med takes the edge off.  Not in a bennie type of way where I feel major relaxation_ tired_ spacey_ etc- just takes that pit of stomach feeling away. The bennies give me a hangover feeling- this doesn't. I really don't think that this drug is for people that have panic attacks though.  Seems to work best for those of us that are just plain_ non-stop worriers. It's no cure but it DEFINITELY has helped me with the worry and fear.  I do break it up though- no more than 7.5 mg at a time -because I get sides effects if too much at once.  For those only on it a month or so- give it more time.  However_ if you have panic I really don't know if it will help you much.",F,48,5  years5mg 4X D,8/18/2010Email,Buspar
310, 5, GAD_ ADD_ BPD,slight cough_ enhanced sense of taste (not necessarily a bad side effect!),This drug has given me so much relief! I have 2x in my life been prescribed other medications - Serzone (1 year)_ Mirtazapine (1 year). I found very little effect or relief from those - probably because I don't think I suffer from depression at all. With my own research_ and MD/therapy help_ I pretty much have concluded that I have GAD and ADD_ and at stressful times in my life_ a version of boderline personality disorder. Buspar has changed so much of that for me. I have calm thoughts_ slower and clearer_ no crazy or angry or fly off the handle reactions. I rarely worry anymore_ or get obsessive in my thinking. My problems in my life have not been seriously debilitating - but over the long term they have been keeping me from being my best self. I hate to admit that a drug could get me back to feeling more like my real self - but Buspar seems to be doing that. It really has taken the edge off_ and I feel like I can navigate through life more confidently and with so much less stress.,F,42,2  weeks10 MG 2X D,8/17/2010,Buspar
311, 5, ANXIETY & PIT-IN-THE-STOMACH FEELIN,The first week was like I was getting the flu-type feeling. I think because the 10 mg 2 x a day_ was too high to start out with. After one week it went away and I felt good. The dr. upped it to 15 mg. 2 x a day. But_ I get too sleepy during the day.  So_ will ask the dr. if I can take the 30 mg before bed and 5 mg during the day to take the edge off. I also feel very sleepy for about 40 mins. to an hour after taking a 15 mg. dose. The only other thing for me_ is a pressure headache if I am late taking a dose. One thing I'd like to say to anyone just starting...start slow and be patient.  You get nothing for nothing. Things take time. I noticed too many newbies as they say_ give up too quickly.  And who ever thinks Buspar is a placebo_ has got to be misinformed.  By no means is this a sugar pill.  It does work!,The pit-in-my-stomach is gone! I am more relaxed.  My muscles are not tense or tight. When around people_ I am much more relaxed and are able to listen_ more than talk. Sleep use to be a big problem. I use to take all kinds of natural sleep-aids (valarian_ L-Ornithine_ L-theanine_ etc.). Now_ I take 6 mg. melatonin an hour before bed and 30 mg. Buspar at bedtime.  I sleep like a baby.  That is amazing for me! My doctor says I need to take Buspar the rest of my life. I'd like to know from others_ how they are doing after taking it for years. My husband says he doesn't see any difference in me. However_ it's the difference I feel inside that counts. When watching suspense movies_ I still get sweaty palms and on the edge of my seat feelings...but that's why they made the movie.  I try to avoid anything on TV that will make me anxious or upset. Every day I walk for 30 minutes_ take my nutrients and drink plenty of water. I feel the Buspar has helped my anxiety and the pit-in-the stomach feeling.  I am grateful to the inventor.,F,58,4  months30 mg 1X D,8/13/2010Email,Buspar
312, 2, Depression / Anxiety,Severe nausea / increase in side effects of Wellbutrin,Was an add on to 300mg Wellbutrin and it was a replacement for 45mg Mirtazapine.  First week was ok_ slight nausea a lot and infrequent waves of extreme nausea_ then the last 3 weeks before stopping constant extreme_ then the last 3 days thought I was going to die from it_ couldn't eat_ sleep or do anything...felt like my insides were going to explode.  Stopped taking it 3 days ago and this morning was the first time I only felt a little sick.  Doc gave me Ativan to take to help with the anxiety and the withdrawal symptoms from the Buspar - tremors_ electric shock feeling_ headache_ teeth grinding_ nervousness etc.The risk of adding this to the Wellbutrin was that it could intensify and possibly bring out side effects of the Wellbutrin..it lived up to it's word.  I do have to say it did help a moderate amount with the anxiety up until the last 3 weeks of it_ however the bad outweighed the good in my case.  Why did I stay on it even though it made me that sick?...tomorrow was always another day and I remained hopeful that in the morning I would wake up feeling better. I'd recommend trying it_ but if the nausea starts to get worse instead of better...don't hope for the best - try something else.,M,40,2  months15 1X D,8/12/2010,Buspar

I finally can sleep at night with very vivid dreams.. I also take .25mg Klonipin when i go to sleep to help with waking up and having axiety in the middle of the night..I finally feel like a functional person.. Give this med a chance..

I immediately went to the doctor.  I wish Buspar would have worked for me_ but oh well...on to the next one.  My doctor prescribed me Vistaril.  So far_ it is actually working GREAT!

After several weeks I caught myself just bobbing my head a little.  I read that you can develop pseudo-parkinsons.  After reading this I abruptly stopped treatment.  I am back to normal now.  Also_ I have had sexual problems ever since stopping Prozac 3 years ago.  Bu spar helped in this respect too.  This is definitely worth a try.

After going through that for 3 years_ it feels pretty amazing to feel that little difference.  I am still experiencing some anxiety_ but it seems like it is getting a bit better.

When the thoughts occur_ I truly do not want to drink or eat and can go on about my evening doing healthy things like watching a movie_ reading_ house work without obsessing.  I have had no luck with SSRIs_ although I would say they improve my mood_ the side effects are not tolerable_ such as extreme fatigue_ indifference_ and sexual dysfunction_ and none of them helped with the addictions.  I'm happy and calm after some seriously stressful events (divorce_ raising a child alone on a very limited income).  I know I will be okay and can raise my child the way I would like and not by just getting by emotionally.

I was taking Xanax before this but it made me so tired that I would fall asleep at my desk for a half hour after taking my second dosage that I had to switch to something else.

I have only been taking it for 5 days and I already notice the difference.  I felt the difference after the first day of taking it.  Currently I am also taking Cymbalta (60 mg/day)_ Neurontin (900 mg/day)_ and Trazodone (150 mg/day).  I was heavily addicted to Xanax (10-30 mg/day) so my psychiatrist did not want to give me any benzos_ of course.  I don't even want to take the benzos because they caused my anxiety to get out of control where I became agoraphobic.  Taking just the three mentioned above helps with my depression and anxiety but not enough.  Now I want to get things accomplished_ have no fear of talking on the phone or going out places_ asking questions_ being straightforward_ etc.  I think I may have finally found the right combination to help me.,F,24,5  days2.5 mg 2X D,5/26/2010Email,Buspar

328, 1, PTSD related Extreme Anxiety/Panic,slight dizziness about a half hour after taking it for about 5 mins.,Buspar is just somthing to give people to shut them up and get them out of the office without giving them a benzodiazipine_ sure Benzos addictive and possibly dangerous_ but so are things you can buy in any gas station called cigarettes and alcohol. Buspar does not work for me_ most likely because I have an actuall anxiety disorder and I'm not merely stressed out from a relationship or from finances or school. If you're stressed and need the idea of somthing to take your mind off your troubles take Buspar_ it's a great placebo_ but if you have earth shattering panic attacks don't waste your time. Sure Benzos are addictive_ but only if they're abused legally or taken as a recreational drug. doses of less than 2mg a day will be matabolized by your liver before it becomes a problem.

He says I should take 15mg once a day_ but that seems strange since everyone seems to be taking a lower dose two or three times a day.  I feel a bit ""on edge"" as though I've had a few cups of coffee. Does this feeling subside after awhile?

380, 5, Anxiety and alcohol abuse,Light headed_ stomach pains,Just started Buspar this afternoon; I had bad stomach pains and was lightheaded_ but I am CALM!! Unbelievable! And I don't have any urge to drink. I drink wine to help with anxiety_ but have been drinking too much_ and the compulsion to drink is just not here!! Could it have worked that quickly?? Sure does seem to have done so. I will put up with the nausea and stomach pains_ to have no anxiety and no urge to drink it away!,F,47,1  days,9/25/2009,Buspar

382, 4, GAD and Panic Attacks,dizziness_ vertigo_ nausea_ loss of appetite,I was having really bad panic attacks in the morning and agoraphobia. I began buspirone 7.5mg a day split into half dosage in the morning and half in the evening. By day two I noticed the anxiety waning. I hope it will continue to work for me. Dramamine helped curb the initial dizziness and nausea side effects. Side effects should cease after 1 week.,F,30,6  days,9/25/2009,Buspar
383, 4, GAD and panic attacks,drowsiness_ blurred vision_ stomach rolls,Prescibed Buspar and Xanax by my regular MD.  Took those for 7 years with good results.  15mg Buspar and .5mg Xanax twice a day.  Now my regular MD has retired and new doctor will not prescribe controlled substances.  Referred to psychiatrist.  Now taking 15mg Buspar twice a day and .5mg Klonopin 3 times a day.  Working OK but my vision is blurry_ I get soooo tired about 2 hours after taking the meds_ my stomach is always rolling and I  have to take .25mg Xanax before driving home from work in the afternoon.  Panic attaks in my car have always been an issue_ but they are coming back more often now.  I ordered Relaquil_ a natural remedy for anxiety_ and I'm going to try that and weaning myself off the prescription meds.  Just not sure how to do that.  Calling doctor today to get help with that.  Good luck to all of you.  If the Relaquil works I will let you know!,F,43,7  years,9/24/2009,Buspar
384, 3, anxiety,light headed_ dizzyness_ room spinning_ foggyness,Only been on it for 10 days. After 48 hours I noticed the first sides of dizziness. Most noticeable when moving to stand from a prone of seated position. The initial bad dizziness subsided after a few hours_ everyday I get waves of lightheadedness_ and slight dizziness still. the best way I can describe it is how I feel after being a bit dehydrated after a workout. Nothing significant_ just a enough to be noticeable in the background of day to day activities. Hoping this takes the edge off my anxiety enough to be worth it.,F,32,10  days,9/15/2009,Buspar
385, 4, anxiety_ panic disorder,1/2 hour after dose: dizzy_ lightheaded. General side effects: mild short-term memory loss_ mild insomnia_ clarity of thought somewhat inhibited_ co-ordination slightly impaired_ possible sexual dysfunction.,This is an update. I posted at the 10-day mark_ too. None of the side effects have been intense_ but they are certainly noticeable_ especially co-ordination and memory function. I started taking Buspar a month ago_ 7.5 mg twice a day. It took two or three weeks to kick in. When it did I noticed a significant drop in general anxiety and unwanted thoughts. It has done nothing for depression. Buspar is by no means a panacea (if only it were)_ but it has taken an edge off_ calmed my mind. I'd prefer Klonopin_ but we all know you can't take that stuff every day. Buspar does not feel as powerful or invasive as an SSRI_ but the potential for a dulling_ zombie-like effect is there. I still have reservations; I'm not completely sold on this drug_ but at this point I cautiously recommend it for general anxiety. I will post again in a few months.,M,29,1  months,9/9/2009Email,Buspar
386, 4, Anxiety,Light headed about a half hour after taking it_ insomnia_ loss of appetite.,I had been taking 15 mg twice daily for a year. I had thought that it wasnt working_ and stopped taking it. BAD IDEA_ i realize now how much it lowered my anxiety levels.,F,20,1  years,9/7/2009,Buspar

Stop this medication immediatly if you have any of these side effects. It does not get better_ it gets worse. Each day_ my symptoms increase. BusPar has had the oppositte effect on me; instead of making my anxiety better_ it has made my anxiety increase to a degree that I have NEVER felt before. Thank God I found these websites_ because my doctor said all of these side effects I am complaining about_ are just in my head! Terrible doctor!

The anxiety about everyday things has lessened....work and all it involves_ the kids _ money_ asteroids falling from the sky. The headaches are bad but I've had a mild to moderate headache everyday since I can remember so.........I'll stick with Buspar. It can only get better.",F,,1  months,8/30/2009,Buspar
389, 4, Anxiety_ stress,PLEASE READ MY COMMENTS,I've been on Buspar for almost 5 years. I have taken 5mg before bed for the past 3 yrs. (Sleep like a baby.) I started out at 15mg/day_ which zonked me out. This drug is a great treatment for anxiety! HOWEVER about a year ago_ I started noticing symptoms of elevated prolactin levels_ which I read can result from long-term use of Buspar. My symptoms are: depression_ anger_ extreme PMS_ hair loss_ low libido_ food cravings and dry skin. My thyroid level is fine and I have no other health problems. I am going to stop taking Buspar and see if any of these symptoms go away. These symptoms have been worsening for the past year_ but I didn't have any idea they could be from Buspar. If anyone else has these symptoms after taking the drug for a long time_ tell your doctor! You'll have to read the fine print to find a connection between Buspar and prolactin in the patient literature.,F,37,4.5  years,8/30/2009,Buspar
390, 1, anxiety,no effects whatsoever; good or bad,If it were not for the comments on here I'd swear this medication was a complete placebo. Was prescribed it several times as an alternative to Ativan and Xanax. Xanax worked ok but left me hungover_ Ativan worked great. After a month I flushed these down the toilet and told my doctor I wanted the ativan back. I know it's hell to get off of_ but at my age_ who cares? I'll be on my 4 to 6 mg the rest of my life but if it works why try and get off. I'm not one of these people who feel taking pills is evil. They were made for a reason and if that's how I have to live my life_ so be it. it beats panic and anxiety attacks. If Buspar works for you_ I'm glad but I secretly think it's mostly sugar.,M,58,3  months,8/26/2009,Buspar
391, 3, Anxiety_ Panic Disorder,Early stages yet. At this time the side effects are minimal. Some insomnia_ but I have always struggled with that. After taking dose_ mild appetite increase_ mild spacey-ness. No brain zaps. No increase in depression. No increase in anxiety. Am monitoring for sexual side-effects_ weight gain_ anger and irritability.,Too early to form a solid opinion about Buspar. At this point_ however_ I am hopeful. My anxiety seems lighter_ my unwanted thoughts more manageable. If the side-effects remain mild and my anxiety continues decreasing_ Buspar will perhaps be a God-send. According to most doctors and patients_ Buspar needs to time to build in your system. So_ I will reserve judgement for another month. At that time I will post again. To all readers and sufferers: good luck_ exercise_ eat well_ stay healthy.,M,29,10  days,8/24/2009Email,Buspar
392, 1, Anxiety,Mood swings_ increased anxiety along serious depression. Headaches and nausea. At it's best_ it caused restlessness_ at it's worst it induced terrible mixed episodes; depression along with anxiety. I began developing strange phobias; agoraphobia was among them. I also began very sensitive to sound_ due to the headaches it was causing me.,This medication exacerbated undiagnosed Rapid Cycle Bipolar Disorder. It threw my mood up and down_ all the while increasing my anxiety to the point where I could barely function. This is a medication that bipolar sufferers need to avoid; even as an add-on to mood stabilizers. Even if I weren't diagnosed as bipolar_ I wouldn't reccomend this medication; it was very_ very unpredictable. If you are prescribed it and you choose to take it_ be very weary of it. If the initial dose causes you any problems_ whatsoever_ I would talk to your doctor about it. This pill literally drove me nuts; from the first dose in the morning_ until about 3 hours after the last dose_ I was out of my mind. It is the worst medication that I have ever been on.,M,,2  months,8/16/2009,Buspar
393, 3, Anxiety,dizziness_ brain zaps_ thinning hair_ hot flashes,Started taking a quarter of 15mg pill the first week with no side effects. Then started taking half of 15mg second week with some slight dizziness half hour after taking it_ then it went away.  A month later started taking 15mg twice a day_ started to get more dizzy half hour after taking it with slight brain zaps.  Sometimes dizziness got so bad I could not drive and it was a pain in the butt to work when it was happening. Lasted about a half an hour to an hour.  Did best if I took it before I went to bed. Noticed my hair thinning a bit.  Now I am back to taking a half twice a day with slight dizziness sometimes.  Thinking of weening off it and taking Lexapro but scared.  Doctor thinks I am too sensitive to the Buspar.  Never been sensitive to meds before. I also take Xanax when needed_ works great!  Cant stand the dizziness anymore!  My heart races less and less anxiety most of the time_ even at night.  Still not enough to do the trick,F,30,2  months,8/13/2009,Buspar
394, 3, GAD,Tightness in throat_ sighing alot_ ADD_ irritability_ clenching teeth,I have added this with Pristiq. Pristiq has helped me but was ready to up the dose a little due to added stress. Dr advised that upping the Pristiq wouldn't double the effect much_ but would double my side effects. (Night sweats_ nausea when taking without food)So we decided to add the Buspar. She prescribed 15 mgs' 2 times a day. But I started with 7.5 mgs twice a day. Starting full 15mg twice a day today....,F,31,1  weeks,8/12/2009Email,Buspar

Compared to other drugs ive tried_ the side effects are basically nonexistent to me and not distressing at all,Its been working great for me and I hope it stays that way. Antidepressants dont work for me when it comes to anxiety. If you have severe  anxiety and/or panic attacks I think this would be a good drug to try.,F,20,2  days,8/7/2009,Buspar

I guess it works for some but not for others.,M,29,2  months,8/2/2009,Buspar
397, 4, chronic anxiety (with Wellbutrin),None except if I take too much the anxiety gets worse. Have to be careful with the dosage. I take 30mg at night_ then 10mg am with 200mg Wellbutrin_ 10mg 2pm with 100mg Wellbutrin. If the balance isn't quite right_ my anxiety comes back some_ but without the Buspar_ I was paralyzed with anxiety that had no base in reality.,Essential to control my organic anxiety. Wellbutrin replaced 13 years of SSRI's_ which got me out of the black depression_ but also made me feel exhausted and useless. I barely kept my job_ and couldn't function much at all at home. I didn't do my taxes for 5 years because the idea of getting the paperwork together overwhelmed me. Wellbutrin was a miracle for me_ I got motivation and energy back.

You don't get any of the typical ""numbness"" that other anxiety meds produce_ you still have a sex drive_ and you remain clear.  My symptoms have pretty much entirely cleared up and I can't tell you how great it has been to get back to living life again.

Long story short; the medication started making me suicidal. While it was in my system during the day_ I was a wreck. Violent mood swings all day long; either nervous/agitated or calm/depressed. When it got out of my system at night (and first thing in the morning) I evened out.

I just dont understand the reports of impotence and low sex drive from this drug (I can't be a unique case).,Great drug to take if you dont want something that makes you high and noticable to others that you are 'taking something for something'. It has removed nearly completely that nagging physical response to stress (I no longer get that 'stomach nagging' feeling when confronted with stress).

I was then prescribed BuSpar for the anxiety.  The first couple of weeks my anxiety was even worse.  I was dizzy and nauseous and actually considered switching medications.  I had to take ativan as needed the first two weeks of starting BuSpar. Somewhere towards the end of the second week I noticed I was in a very good mood and there were no more anxiety attacks.  I feel very calm now and I do not experience any side effects other than a mild dizziness for an hour after taking the medication.  The dizziness is becoming less noticeable as time goes on.  The only thing I don't like is that this does not come in a once-a-day extended release form.

I have headaches all the time and I've noticed the past week my headaches are less than usual to boot. I hate this drug has effected some people badly....it's becoming a mircle drug for me.

423, 5, GAD_ depression_ ADD,mild to significant vertigo_ dizziness_ feeling of fatigue_ but never for more than an hour after dose.  I generally have found that taking my mid-day dose a little later_ and making sure to eat beforehand_ helped reduce the nauseau_ dizziness_ etc._ though at times I do still feel these problems a bit_ but the side-effects are definitely insignificant (for me_ everybody's different) compared to the positive results.  mildly concerned about feeling of emotional distance,I've been very pleased with buspar_ it is the first anti-anxiety medication I've ever taken that I really felt helped.  It did take a couple weeks to kick in_ but once it did I was very impressed.  For me_ by far the most important improvement was a decline in fatigue_ and a much easier time getting up in the morning: I went from having difficulty getting up before noon to having difficulty getting up before 7:00 a.m.  I've generally felt much more able to concentrate_ especially in the mornings.  Perhaps more than anything else_ being able to get started on schoolwork (I'm a grad student)_ which in turn meant that I felt a lot less overwhelmed by daily responsibilities.  I was particularly impressed that compared to benzodyazopime it didn't cause nearly as much drowsiness_ but most happily of all_ it doesn't appear to cause the sexual side effects of SSRI's.,M,29,3  months,4/9/2009,Buspar

The diziness and headaches are WAY better than the anxiety.  I've only had 3 panic attack in the last 6 months.  That's down from 5 to 10 a day before I started the medication.

Difficulty losing weight despite intense exercise and healthy diet.,I take 10mg three times per day_ and my wife and I both believe this drug has changed my life.  I no longer have mood swings_ and I feel much more relaxed in virtually every type of social setting.  After six weeks it's hard to remember what it was like to completely lose my temper.  In addition_ it has helped reduce my use of tobacco products.  The only downside is the weight issue... without intense exercise_ my guess is that I probably would have gained 15-20 lbs by now.

So now I'm not sure if I should go up in the dosage to 10mg twice a day as instructed or if I should stay.  The agitation is pretty bad and I HATE feeling this way.

Honestly_ I had little hope that Buspar would work. My starting dose was 5mg twice a day and I stayed there. This med had an impact on my health from day one. A few hours after taking my first dose I noticed my ever present palpitations had seized. By day 2 my daily headaches were 90 percent better. By the end of week one the lump in my throat was gone. Now_ after 6 weeks I am calm_ energized_ friendly and very patient with my daughter_ family and friends. I have also lost 11 pounds I gained on Prozac.

Initially I HATED this drug with a passion_ however I vowed to myself that I would stick out the initial side effects and give it at least 2 months_ if it didn't work by then I planned on stopping. My psychiatrist prescribed me buspar as well as xanax to cope with the accute attacks in the short term with the plan to wean off as soon as possible.  I'm now up to 30 mg daily divided into 2 doses. I'm also slowly but successfully weaning off the xanax without feeling the need to depend on it anymore and am confident the horrible initial side effects of the buspar are gone.

No mood changes or sexual side effects... and no immediate w/d symptoms if I'm late in taking a dose.  I'm also on Vyvanse for ADHD - so I think the blurred vision is a combo of both Buspar and Vyvanse.

My husband recommended a psych dr._ and at my wits end_ I made the appt.  The dr. also diagnosed me as a type A personality_ in which anxiety is very common.  He recommended Xanax_ but I declined because I have know people whom have had to enter rehab after using it.  He then recommended Buspar_ but told me it may take a little while to kick in.  It took about 2 weeks_ but when it did_ it did WONDERFULLY.  The anxiety was the least of my worries at the time_ but I have noticed it is easier for me to socially engage now that I am taking it.  However_ the itching is HIGHLY relieved_ and my dermotologist advised that she recommend that I continue on the buspar because it turns off a signal to my brain that triggers the weird itch.

However_ I vowed to stay on it long enough to get through the initial side effects_ and they faded after several days.  Now_ I experience only an intense desire to eat and eat the first hour or two after taking it.  Avoiding weight gain because of this requires good discipline -- drinking lots of water when I get that feeling helps.  The benefits of having most of my anxiety symptoms entirely relieved_ getting good sleep_ and feeling calm and clear-headed far outweigh the minor side effect of occasional_ very slight stomach discomfort and having to be disciplined when the eating urges come (which again last only an hour_ or two at most).,I'm happy that I can now avoid taking Xanax (alprazolam) almost entirely -- I hated the side effects and addictive qualities of even very low-dose Xanax.,M,39,5  months,11/23/2008,Buspar

My doctor decided to start me on buspar 5mg 3X per day and I noticed a change in my emotions and behavior within 2 weeks.  I felt calmer_ less angry and reactive_ and my anxiety attacks subsided almost entirely (I used to take xanax for panic attacks as needed--but now I have a small prescription that has lasted me over a year!)  I was on 10mg 2X per day but the brain fog really started to bother me (particularly in the morning when I need to be alert).  My doctor told me to try taking 5mg (instead of 10mg) in the morning which has helped a lot with the brain fog.  I still take 10mg at night before bed. So I take 15mg per day total. This drug has helped me immensely and I am so thankful to have found something that works.

I am on 25 mgs of zoloft. I told my doc it wasn't doing much so she said taper off it and start buspar at 7.5 mg 2x a day. Some will say it is too soon to tell-I am still on the zoloft but after one day of taking the buspar I'm amazed at how good this combo makes me feel. I woke up alert_ happy_ ready to go. I'm much more inclined to do what I need to and not lay around sleeping. I am mildly phobic of the phone but today I felt no qualms about picking it up. Can it work this fast? I don't know.

Full absorption and effectiveness of the medicine occurred after 1-1.5 months of consumption.  Historic doses taken ranged between 15 mg entry level up to 30 mg max.  15 mg. was the max dose I was able to tolerate on this medicine.  Any adjustments to the medicine had a tendency to cause brain zaps_ a fixation with my past_ and mood alterations (FYI_ I am highly sensitive to dose alterations on most medicines).

It has been marketed as safer than benzos because it is non addicting; however_ you need to read on about how the drug affects the brain_ which is equivalent to chemical brain lobotomy. I have taken SSRIs and benzos before. Buspar is not safe to take. Do your research on this drug before considering it. Most of these are from withdrawing from the drug after only 3 days of taking it.

The difference in anxiety is signficant and even more significant_ it has cured med-resistant depression - serious_ potentially life-threatening depression. If you can't take Wellbutrin or Efflexor or have anxiety-specific depression_ I'd give Buspar a try. It hits the right brain cells and as far as I can see_ has almost no side effects.

Who knows what else it could do. I took it only for 3 days_ and stopped. The withdrawals were such as heightened panic attacks and most of the side effects I mentioned lingered for 5 days. This was worse than SSRIs and Benzo withdrawals as far as I am concern. It definitely messes up your brain. I can't imagine the long term effect of this drug. It is not as safe as they claim. I read that this type of drug can potentially cause serious permanent brain damage (chemical lobotomy) and I believe it_ because the side effects were pretty intense. Even if you don't feel it is working right away_ it will kill your brain cells. It is more dangerous than Xanax in my opinion. I got of Xanax before after over 4 weeks of use. It was difficult but the withdrawals were nothing like Buspar. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS DRUG due and is being marketed as non addictive and safer than Benzos. No way!,F,45,3  days,7/7/2008,Buspar

532, 5, GAD,Some occasional brief dizziness when not taken with food.,Wow! At first I didn't think this was doing anything for me_ good or bad_ but after around 10 days everything suddenly changed.  Now_ I no longer suffer from constant worrying.  I am mellower_ much easier to get along with_ less irritable.  I am more energetic_ have better concentration/focus and am no longer unnecessarily stressed out when problems arise.  I've felt no nasty side effects like I had with SSRIs_ no dopey feelings like I had with benzos.  Taking 5mg 3x--doctor has offered to bump me up to 10mg 3x_ but I think the smaller dose is working just fine!,M,41,1  months,1/1/2008,Buspar

I became pregnant and my doctor wanted me weaned off the xanax immediately. (This was over a 2 week period_ which I think was a little negligent of my doctor considering how long I've been on it) I have been experiencing withdrawals from the xanax and I honestly believe if it wasn't for the buspirone that I would be freaking out much worse right now. I read that it doesn't help with the withdrawals of benzos_ but I think it is taking the edge off a little. I'm willing to stick with it and it's side affects to feel the full benefits. I just wish there was something safe for me to take in addition that could help with the xanax withdrawals. Is there?,F,28,2  weeks,12/28/2007Email,Buspar

I'm at the 3 week mark now_ but so far I'm just experiencing side effects.  I'm taking a a small dose of clonazepam at night to help with the insomnia.

540, 5, anxiety,The first week I felt sort of out of it and in a daze_ but that did subside. Occasionally I do experience dizziness_ lightheaded_ sleepiness_ loss of appetite_ vivid and erotic dreams_ increased libido. Pretty much an added benefit really. I can live with all the side effects.,Overall this medication has been nothing but beneficial for me. It did take some time to notice how it helped with my anxiety and being able to be sociable with people and not have intense feelings of panic when going out in public. Previously I had taken a few different antidepressants and had extreme negative side effects that did nothing for my anxiety_ which is my main problem. Buspar has dramatically helped although no medication is a total cure all_ but I see a difference and people I know such as family notice a tremendous difference in my overall demeanor and mood in that I am much more calm and don't get freaked out and fly off the handle over little things like I used to. No real negative side effects like I got with antidepressants.,F,30,3  months,11/20/2007,Buspar

I am a low dose kind of person and now I take it at night to help me sleep or if I feel anxiety come on. They say it takes weeks to start working but I felt the effect right away and now I feel it helps even though I do not take it regulary.

Stopped taking the medication immediately and side effects took one week to subside. Thought I was having a major gall bladder attack. Started to take the medication again_ and within one day's dose_ the same effects started again and lasted another week.  What agony. My physician said my response was similar to a cancer patient's response (although I have never had cancer).,This drug_ despite the debilitating side effects_ made my brain feel great.  I would like to have  continued taking it for the excellent mental/emotional/cognitive benefits (even after a few doses)_ but was completely destroyed physically by the serotonin change that caused major gut distress.,M,37,2  days,11/2/2007,Buspar

Gradually weened off_ then anxiety set in several years later.  Dr. suggested Buspar this time as my symptoms are more anxiety related--not out of control_ just feel overwhelmed at times.  I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with the side effects_ especially within the 10-30 minutes after taking each dose.  I can't easy look past the side effects to see if I'm less anxious!  I'm on 7.5 mg 2x/day and I'm supposed to increase but that's not going to happen at this point.

I have been taking 7.5mg_ but up my dose to one 15mg/daily starting tomorrow. I feel pretty good and feel a little less anxious and panicky already! I noticed after I eat I feel like Im going to vomit. It induces extreme nausea_ but I do not mind because its helping to control my normally huge appetite. I smoke and this medicine makes not even want to even finish a cigarette whatsoever_ which is probably a good thing. I have had ONE weird experience so far_ which was only a couple days into taking 7.5mg - as I was trying to sleep I had an electrical shock feeling from my hip to a little lower on right side only?

It seems as though the amount of ejaculate produced has increased as well.  I take it for anxiety and depression_ but I'm not sure I EVER want to go off of it!  It has helped with my anxiety_ as I used to break down and cry at the drop of a hat.  My cat meowing at me for food could make me cry!  That has decreased a lot.

I was so dizzy and drowsy the first time I took it that I fell asleep at the dinner table (at a fine-dining restaurant -- talk about embarrassing!)  My doctor then told me to only take it at night before bed and start at 5mg_ then go up by 5mg increases as needed.  I am now on day 16_ up to 15mgs_ and last night had these wierd spasms -- one of the most bizarre_ uncomfortable feelings ever!!  It started about 10 minutes after taking the meds.  I was laying in bed and all of a sudden felt this shock wave start in my mid-back_ then run up my neck_ through my arms to my fingertips.  Then my back and arms would spasm.  This went on for about 30-45 minutes!  I was thrashing all around my bed_ aching_ twitching_ and trying to make it stop.  It felt HORRIBLE!!

I started at 7.5mg first dose_ and it increased my anxiety_ gave me a neck ache and overall bad experience.However_ instead of just giving up on it_ i decided to wait until a weekend when i was off and could deal with a side effect and to start back at 5mg instead of 7.5.  This worked well and i have been able to titrate up slowly with fairly good results. To those who started with 15mg and then freaked out and gave up_ i recommend to be reasonable and start slowly.

I've also noticed that I have trouble sleeping if I take it too close to bedtime.,Buspar has helped me quite a bit_ although it took a while to get the right dosage figured out.  It has significantly reduced my anxiety and unwanted thoughts_ allowing me to get back to living my life without worrying all the time. I can actually concentrate again! When I do get some anxiety_ it passes fairly quickly_ and if I have an unwanted thought it is usually fleeting and doesn't send me into an anxiety attack.  The side effects are pretty intense_ though - might be too much for some.  I take 40 mg/day and had to split up my AM dose_ taking 20 mgs. in the AM was making me pretty sick.

584, 4, GAD,Little buzz in the AM_ but that was mixing 15 mg Buspar with 50 mg Atenolol. Have not taken it without any other med.Initial starting dose was 10 mg_ stepped up to 15 a week later_ then 25_ and now 30 mg a day.,Anxiety is almost non existent. Feel more confident in dealing with daily activities and people. Works for me but everyone has a different metabolism.I have read that eating Grapefruit/drinking the juice can have detrimental effects on how it works in your system. Worth checking on if you include this in your diet.,M,45,45  days,4/11/2007,Buspar
585, 4, GAD,the side effects were very mild.  The first couple of days it was sort of like I'd had a lot of caffeine_ but it wasn't enough to really be bad.  I suggest taking it on a weekend to get over the side effects.  After about the 3rd day I dont feel it at all,Its a great drug.  I don't feel like I'm drugged_ I have no side effects_ I'm just normal.  I never felt a moment where it just kicked in_ its just like I  never felt it.. never noticed that it worked specifically_ except that now I just am ok with everything.  I guess after about 2 weeks is when I realized I was not freaking out about every stupid little thing.  I can sleep at night now_ and its great.  I didn't want a drug to make me feel drugged_ I just wanted to feel like I should.  Now I'm motivated_ I can concentrate_ I can focus at school..  i don't think of constant what if scenarios all the time anymore..  I think i feel for the first time what its like to be normal.  I take 10 mgs twice a day_ i initially was working up to 30 mgs_ but when I got to 25 I noticed I got sort of depressed_ and I went back to 20 mgs_ and that is perfect for me.,F,35,2  months,4/9/2007,Buspar

I am calmer_ don't have racing thoughts or pounding heart in the middle of the night_ and am sleeping much better. One major component of my anxiety was blushing furiously whenever I was addressed in a group or even just caught off guard with a question. Buspar has helped me stop worrying about it_ which helps keep it from happening as often or as severely. Also_ I don't have that tight_ wound-up feeling that I used to carry around all day.,F,33,2  weeks,4/9/2007,Buspar

I feel no difference when I am on it and when I am off of it.  I take 60 mg a day.  It does nothing to control my anxiety and panic attacks.  The psychiatrist in the hospital put me on klonopin which works but my current doctor does not ""believe"" in benzo type drugs for anyone_ so I must suffer with being untreated_ because doctors believe the hype that drug companies state that this drug works.  It is totally worthless and I might as well be taking aspirin for my panic attacks. So basically I am living untreated for my disorder and it is like putting a band-aid on a broken leg.  It is the most worthless drug for anxiety ever.",F,42,5  years,4/4/2007,Buspar

I feel much calmer in general and can almost go into crowded places without panic. I am curious about those folks who have posted with just a few days use - my psychiatrist clearly stated that buspar takes at least three weeks before effects would be noticed.  I found this to be true and am happy I stuck it out for a few months before deciding if it was really helping. Now at 10 mo. I am feeling the best I have felt for 20 years!

My orgasm is back!  Yahoo!  :-)  Anyway_ this medication has helped me.  I would recommend people try it.

I am the only person who has experienced the ED side effect that I have see. I did notice that less than 1/1000 experienced it with the trials. But_ having never had a problem_ I don't know what else to blame it on? Basically_ I just feel numb down there. Hopefully_ that will clear up_ and the drug will start doing what it is supposed to.

I noticed by end of the first week an immediate difference. My constant worry was gone_ and the obsessive thoughts went away. I became a happier_ calmer person. Another thing that I like is if you skip a dose_ there are no side effects like with other medications I tried. I once skipped a whole weekend because I forgot to pack my pills and I was fine.

I would touch  wood and it would feel like fur_ etc.  I would sit in a chair and not feel it.  Rubbing my legs together felt like someone else touching me_ etc.  Feelings like that....hard to put into words.,I've heard stories about sensory altering recreational drugs (Ecstacy_ etc) and honestly if I wasn't experiencing grave anxiety all of this would have been fun.  But I needed a cure for anxiety so this only increased the panic... Of course my MD thought I was making up side effects to return to Ativan and recommended I ignore effects and continue.  Needless to say I discontinued use_ I'd gladly have anxiety if it means a proper sense of touch!  If this drug works for you_ great!

635, 1, chronic anxiety,insomnia_ panic attacks_ nervousness_ muscle tension_ twitching_ difficulty swallowing,Who invented this horrible drug? When my doctor suggested it as an alternative to Clonazepam_ I tried it for a week. I was optimistic knowing that Buspar was developed specifically for anxiety rather than depression_ unlike other drugs like Paxil and Zoloft that have been developed to treat both at the same time. I'm not depressed and just want to shed anxiousness and feel normal so I can interact with my friends and function well at work.  I cannot describe the horrific effects Buspar had on me. Rather than treating symptoms of anxiety_ it intensified them. I found myself out for dinner but unable to eat because I couldn't swallow food normally. And denying lunch invitations because I didn't want good friends to ask why I wouldn't eat. Sleep? Fat chance. I got maybe a total of 1 night's sleep in 5 nights. I could not go to sleep for at least 6 hours after taking a 5-mg dose of Buspar. Never mind how long it took while on the higher dose the doctor prescribed. I agree w,F,34,7  days,8/20/2006,Buspar
636, 2, Anxiety attacks,First few days I was Ok with it. Soon after I have difficulty thinking and remembering things. Cordination is non-existant and could not perform my job at work well. My blood pressure is higher_ my anxiety has been worse and my heart has been racing more.,I think it is probably one of those medications that work for some and not others. Just have to be aware of the side effects and notify your doctor if you experience these things.,M,37,3  months,8/2/2006,Buspar
637, 5, anxiety,"Like others have noted here_ I get a little ""spacey"" for about an hour after I take it. This doesn't happen often. I've taken buspar twice before for the agitation/anxiety caused by antidepressants. This is my third time taking buspar-now with wellbutrin. This combo really seems to work well.",I took prozac for ten years off and on. When I would go back on it would give me quite a bit of anxiety.  I would only be on it for a short period of time (4-6 weeks) and ween off it. I'm now taking 5mg buspar twice daily along with 150 mg Wellbutrin XL. Only taking the buspar for the bit of agitation from the wellbutrin.  As with other AD's_ buspar works great w/Wellbutrin. Helps with the negative effects of anxiety along with helping the Wellbutrin work better. I would highly recommend it.,M,34,2  weeks,7/26/2006,Buspar
638, 1, Panic/social phobia/depression,Tingling/numbness/parethesia in my feet.,I had to stop taking it because the side effects were (and still are) driving me crazy.  I've been off it completely for 3 days now_ and I've only had minimal feeling return to my feet.  It's causing me difficulty walking and moving my toes.  Can't wait to get this stuff out of my system.,F,36,2  weeks,7/25/2006,Buspar
639, 3, Post Partum Anxiety,"About an hour after taking it_ I felt ""high""--tingling feeling in the head_ dizziness_ cloudy thoughts.  I also felt so fatigued and had such an overwhelming deisre to sleep that sometimes I would collapse into bed (fortunately_ I am a teacher and it is summer break_ so I have that luxury).  Every night for the last two weeks I have been suffering through terrible tension headaches that only Ativan will relieve.  The doctor wants me to take 10 mg/3 times a day_ but that would mean I can't function for half of my day.  I also cannot lose my pregnancy weight (in fact I gained more!) but the doctor thinks this isn't an issue to be dealt with.",Originally_ within the first week I felt a lightening of my mood and I also noticed increased sex drive.  But after a month_ I no longer felt the drug was helping.  And after further investigation into family history and my own symptoms_ I am more inclined to thing I have a thyroid imbalance than an anxiety disorder.,F,31,3  months,7/22/2006,Buspar
640, 5, anxiety / depression,sleeplessness_ a bit of memory loss_ increased sex drive,Buspar has helped me a great deal.  I take 45 mg/day along with 300 mg Zoloft.  I've been so incorrectly medicated for years now_ and now I'm on a combo that BAM!  My mind is quiet_ I can focus and have rational thoughts.  But just the fact that my head is quiet makes all the difference in the world to me.  I've read some bad experiences here; but maybe this needs to be prescribed with the correct combo_ and any psych patient knows you guinea pig it before you find the perfect combo.  I love it_ my life is different and I have a positive outlook on life now.,F,25,1  months,7/21/2006Email,Buspar
641, 1, GAD,Dizzyness_ insomnia_ panic attacks_ hyper restlessnless_ muscle pain in calf_ on and off tingling and numbness in fore arm,Many books describe this drug as effective and very safe without mentioning potential side effects or the fact that this drug only works for 40% of the folks who take it. I startd with high hopes.In total I took only 5 doses of .10 dosage. I felt like I was on speed_ wired. I never felt tired or yawned once in 2 1/2 days. Awoke with panic attacks 3 times in one night. Also felt stange muscle pain in calf_ felt like dead muscle. The very very sad fact is that a patient with GAD is left with 3 choices as I see it_suffering_benzos (which are addictive_ but work)or the SSR's which have horrible side effectsPick your poison and hope science can come up with something better soon!,M,55,2  days,7/15/2006,Buspar
642, 5, Chronic acute anxiety_ moodswings,I have had no side effects at all_ much to my surprise.,I have always been suspicious and skeptical about prescription meds.  In fact_ for years I tried every homeopathic/natural/herbal treatment i could find to treat my reoccuring anxiety/depression.  I had also had brief stints with antidepressants.  So_ it is no small thing for me to say that this medication has changed my life.  I was very suspicious_ looking for side effects (i'm normally quite sensitive to meds) and had ABSOLUTELY NONE.  I feel like myself for the first time in my life.  When i finally realize how hard i worked all those years to stay 'balanced' it makes me really sad because i could have felt like this sooner.  It has helped with my obsessive thinking and my chest and stomach no longer feel tight all day long.  I do not feel at all 'druggy'.  My moods faciliate with what is going on in my life_ but I don't feel anxious for no reason.  It is easier for me to work through the problem of the moment because i'm not exhausting myself trying to interpret my feelings of anx,F,31,4  months,7/11/2006,Buspar
643, 5, Chronic acute anxiety_ moodswings,I wanted to add that_ though i've had no side effects_ i wanted to tell people that it is important to take it the same way every day (with or without food--one or the other).  The package said this and i ignored it at first but i seemed to get very different amounts into my system if i took it on empty stomach and ate 20 minutes later vs. eating first.  (i get more in my system on an empty stomach and so i have to take less of Buspar to get the benefit so I always take it on an empty stomach now.),I'm adding more here too because this medication has really helped me and i resisted trying it for years because of certain tendencies that i think are common for people with anxiety or compulsive thinking.  No doubt_ this drug isn't for everyone. It's probably even bad for some people.  But_ after i got serious about trying this and found it helped me_ something funny happened: i cleaned out my car and found an empty bottle of buspar_ exact same dosage per pill_ dated years earlier.  I realized that during one of my desperate moments i must have taken the prescription and decided after 2 days that i was afraid of the side effects and tossed the rest of the pills in the trash.  I mean_ it was the exact same pill and dosage that has now changed my life.  The point of the story is that we anxious people are very good at noticing changes in our bodies (this can be a positive or negative skill depending on the circumstances) and I think sometimes we falsely attribute our increased anxiety,F,31,4  months,7/11/2006,Buspar
644, 5, withdrawal from clonazepam,I have noticed that my appetite can get out of control if I do not go to bed at a set time.  Had major back surgery in March and got addicted to pain and muscle relaxer meds after 3 weeks.  When discontinued pain meds _ started having severe anxiety attacks and dizziness.  Doctor prescribed clonazapam.  Had some very severe side affects from clonazepam.  Starting cutting pills into smaller and smaller pieces over a 2 month period and Dr. added buspar twice a day.  Have been taking welbutrin xl for 1 year for SAD and to quit smoking.  One month after having stopped clonazapam_ I am feeling great_ no anxiety_ sleeping good.  Buspar seems to work well with the Welbutrin.  Have not felt this good emotionally and physically in 10 years.,I have noticed that My vision is not quite as good as it use to be.

Sometimes this is helped by taking Buspar with food. I've also sometimes felt sleepy after taking Buspar; that could last for one or two hours_ but it doesn't happen very often.,I've suffered with generalized anxiety disorder on and off since my early twenties. A few weeks ago (March 2006)_ I began experiencing excessive daily anxiety and my thoughts centered around irrational worries about my health. Within two weeks of starting Buspar--I specifically remember the exact moment_ while I was talking with a friend online at night--the thoughts stopped. The physiological manifestations of anxiety (e.g. sweaty palms_ an anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach) stopped. My affect changed from fearful to cheerful (normal_ for me). Behaviorally_ I went from avoiding some people and situations to behaving as I did without anxiety. I had read that many people had had a little relief from Buspar_ some had had no relief at all_ and a lucky few had their problem completely solved. I am one of those in the third category. I feel completely normal now. I only realize how much I had been suffering from the anxiety by knowing how I feel now and remembering what it was li,M,36,23  days,6/17/2006,Buspar

691, 5, anxiety,Had next to no side effects from buspar.,Buspar is a great anti-anxiety med though it does not work as could for ocd type anxiety it works well for panic attacks and gad. It is not addictive like benzo meds. If you are coming off benzo meds you should not take buspar because you will be just wasting your time. It helped me a great deal and if you are having panic attacks or gad and have not been taking benzo meds it is worth your time to try it once but give it time maybe 2 weeks and you should start to feel better.,M,21,3  months,7/25/2005,Buspar

693, 3, Anxiety,Dizziness_ insomnia_ electric shock (once in a while).,I had been put on buspar to help my anxiety go away.  I was supposed to take 2 pills a day (10 mg each) once in the morning and once in the evening.  After the first pill I took_ the side effects hit me like a train.  I could barely move_ and knew that I was getting stomped by these pills.  I decided to go off of the pills for about a week (after only taking one) and then had another slight anxiety attack.  I called my doctor and he said that It would be ok to break the pill in half and take half dosage.  I did that_ and the side effects were cut in half_ and tolerable.  However_ after 2-3 weeks of taking it_ I was still un-able to feel comfortable out of the house.  My anxiety comes with nausea_ which doesnt allow me to do much of anything.  I went to see the doctor today_ im going to decrease and cut out my buspar medication and start on another anxiety/antidepression medicine called Wellbutrin XL.  Hopefully this works.  Side note:  Although taking antidepressent medicine_ I have no depression_ just anxiety.

767, 5, Anxiety,Weight gain (7 lbs),I began taking 15 mg of Buspar and had to increase to 20 mg per day after 1 year. Since have gained 7 pounds. Although I am very uncomfortable with the weight gain I am extremely satisfied with the normal life I'm able to have without the Anxiety. I did find myself sleeping better when splitting my Buspar dose twice a day with my last dose being no later than 2:30 pm daily.,F,40,2.5  years,8/6/2002,Buspar

770, 1, Anxiety,Weight gain of 20 lbs_ insombia_ numbness of fingers_ diahrrhea_ dizziness_ disorientation_ loss of memory_ confusion_ extreme muscle aches and fluid retention causing pressure on bone joints which resulted in terrible arthritic like pain symptoms.,I would not recommend BuSpar to anyone.  The symptoms sneaked up  slowly and I did not relate them to the drug early on.,F,68,10  weeks,7/6/2002,Buspar
771, 2, generalized anxiety,Increased my anxiety_ needed sleeping pills frequently_ extreme fear and disorientation_ worst thing I ever did.,This medication CAN dramatically increase anxiety_ my Dr. convinced me that if I stopped_ anxiety would get even worse. After suffering for 6 months_ I cautiously tapered the dose_ each reduction was followed by a day or two of wiredness and then whaddayaknow_ I felt better. Now on Zoloft_ worked much faster and better although it is tough in the beginning weeks_ don't be afraid to ask for a working medication.,M,38,18  months,7/1/2002,Buspar
772, 4, Anxiety from Prozac dosage,Headaches which went away after a couple of weeks_ weight gain of a nagging 5 pounds. Usually after first taking it I feel pretty normal_ but as the day wears on I can feel it slacking off-we adjusted the dosage to 60mgs but need to balance the dosages better. I have started to bruise extremely easy as well. Need to discuss if that is a side effect of any kind.,"As we have adjusted the dosages I have had more comfort in my daily living. Prior to taking this (and just the Prozac)_ I was emotionally housebound. The bruising concerns me_ as I am hoping to not need to come off of it. There are times when I wish it would ""kick in"" with a little extra help.",F,45,3  months,6/26/2002,Buspar
773, 4, anxiety,My hands fall asleep in the middle of the night_ and also feel numb at times_ and I  am beginning to wonder if it is related to this drug.,"this drug does completely alleviate my anxiety_ so I am very reluctant to stop taking it.  It makes me stop worrying about anything_ but doesn't leave me ""numb"" to my experiences.  I think it makes me feel 100% mentally ""normal.""",F,40,5  years,6/21/2002,Buspar
774, 2, Anxiety,Buspar relieved my anxiety_ but at a high cost.  I began suffering from depression one week after starting the Buspar_ so my doctor added Imipramine (I've taken this before_ with no side effects) to the mix.  That seemed to reduce the depression.  But then came the fatigue.  I could hardly get out of bed in the morning.  Within two years I went from being physically fit and healthy (other than some anxiety)to being forty pounds overweight with high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  I also developed gallbladder problems.  I stopped the Buspar two months ago.  I had a pretty bad anxiety backlash for about a month_ then I returned to normal.  The anxiety is gone_ but now I have to deal with all the medical problems I developed because of the Buspar.,,F,44,2  years,6/5/2002Email,Buspar

I am a regional trainer_ give training seminars and can speak in front of large groups of people fearlessly.

794, 4, Depression with Anxiety,"decreased carb cravingsfeeling somewhat ""out of it""/dizziness (decreased over time)",I had severe insomnia prior to taking Buspar.  I initially had a good response (improved mood but insomnia remained) but it faded 7-10 days later.  I started feeling suicidal so I got off of it for about 5 days but no change in depression.  I attributed my severe depressed state to taking melatonin at night for sleep (which changes your seratonin balance).  Now I'm back on Buspar 15 mg TID and discontinued melatonin.  My doctor added 1 mg each of Xanax and Klonopin plus 1200 mg Neurontin at night.  Now I have improved sleep and no longer feel out of it when on Buspar.  Overall_ I feel much better.  I think the lesson here is that it is the combination of meds which determine your side effects and just because you experience negative side effects initially_ doesn't necessarily mean the drug is not right for you.  You may just need to wait it out for your body to get used to it or ask the doctor for a medication adjustment.,F,33,1  months,9/1/2001Email,Buspar
