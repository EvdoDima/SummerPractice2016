0, 1, Hairloss,Poison,I'm a 24 year old heathly male with high testosterone levels and DHT etc_ just had it all checked. This drug completely ruined my libedo. I tried it twice_ each attempt was one year apart yet both times I had the exact same symptoms.Day 3 - 7 a surge in libedo_ feeling hyper and super aroused. Day 7 - 14 feeling pretty normal. Then after day 14 my sex drive disappeared. Can't get aroused even if watching porn etc. Orgasms also not as enjoyable.Please be very careful if you decide to use this drug. And don't even think about propecia_ that stuff is undeniably poison!,M,24,  1X D,6/22/2016,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

2, 1, hair loss,Poor libido_ lack sex drive.  Partial impotency,If you are a man and you think you need your hair more than you need sex I suggest you go for this drug BUT if you think you can't afford to lose even 0.0001% of your sex life then never imagine application of any drug from this company for curing hair loss. This drug is rapid sex life eliminator. I always get scared_ I just pray I recover. I just hope and pray.

5, 1, Stop/reduce receding hair.,Loss of libido_ weak erections_  Headaches and tiredness. It also caused urinating problems - I believe it was causing irritation to my pelvic floor muscles_ I even went to the doctor cause I thought I had an enlarged prostate. I stopped using it a week ago and all these side effects have gone. This stuff needs to be taken off the shelves!,,M,44,9  months,1/25/2016,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
6, 1, receding hairline,Began to see severe side effects by day 4! Fatigue_ difficulty with exercise routines I had previously completed with ease. Could barely(with a lot of work) get an erection. My thought process just slowed down. I could barely feel the effect of my ADHD medication(Adderall xr 20mg). I felt sort of depressed and sad constantly,It's too bad because even though the box said that it might not work as well for receding hairline(it's mostly recommended for vertex area) I could see some small improvements after 4/5 days of use. I decreased application to once daily to see if side effects would at least be tolerable but did not work. Then after taking 5 days off I began to feel better so I tried once daily every other day but still it was too much lethargy. Finally I just gave up. I reaaaally tried to make it work because I saw positive changes in my hairline rather quickly but the side effects are just not worth it.,M,50,16  daysfoam1/2cap 2X D,1/7/2016,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
7, 1, Hair loss,No question it's the Rogaine. I felt fine and as soon as I put it on_ I felt palpitations and anxious. It's completely made me feel very anxious and easily irritated and_ most importantly_ my blood pressure went up. Seems counterintuitive on a product initially meant to lower bp_ but for sure this is the only thing that's different. And as I said_ I noticed immediately when I applied it each night. So hair loss it will have to be. And I'm a woman trying to nip this in the bud but I won't sacrifice my health. Terrible.,I used the 5%. I don't think that's extra strength but that's where all the comments were located so I posted here.,F,50,3  days5% 1X D,11/10/2015Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

10, 1, Thinning hair,Update on my post of 6/12/2015,Was still not functioning properly...some morning erections_ but maybe 70% of normal. Re-tested for Prolactin and LH levels.  LH was 0 Prolactin 4.  Both too low.  My Endo rx was gaba_ glutamine_ l-arginine_ l-lysine.  I have also read the soy / soy milk can increase prolactin levels.  All of these have helped.  Seem to be able to function now with the help of Viagra.  Even Viagra did not help when hormone levels were down.  Keeping my fingers crossed that I continue to improve.

11, 1, thinning hair,Diminished libido_ less frequent/strong erections_ sore scalp with no hair growth,I just assumed my diminished libido was a consequence of aging_ though I am otherwise in outstanding physical condition. I never associated these symptoms with the use of the Rograine until I finally stopped using it_ only because of it's ineffectiveness as a hair restorer. Within 2 DAYS! I noticed a marked improvement in my sexual desire and function. I have no doubt that minoxidil can cause serious sexual side effects_ at least in some men. I also have no doubt that the drug companies knew this all along and should be held accountable.,M,62,4  years5% foam 1X D,7/9/2015,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

Besides those side effects_ I also noticed that my brain felt foggy and that I was not functioning up to my intellectual ability.  None of these side effects are listed on the package.

13, 1, Thinning hair,Complete Impotence_ Loss of Libido_ Can not ejaculate on rare occasions I could get erect.,I started using 2% Liquid Rogaine 20 years ago when I was 33 years old.  I was put on High Blood Pressure meds two years later.  Coincidence?  No ED problems until 4 years ago when I switched to 5% Foam.  Never put two and two together.  How dumb I am.  I thought it was old age and started using Viagra which worked very well_ so no big deal.  Then_ a year ago_ Viagra and the others all stopped working.  No explanation.  Went to an Endo.  Found my Total Testosterone was 225.  The minimum is 300.  I was 700 five years earlier.  My Endo got my Total Test up to 1700 which is crazy high.  I feel like superman_ but still can get my dick up.  This is killing me...Then_ I saw this forum.  I can't believe the Rogaine would do this.  However_ I quit the Rogaine 10 days ago (6/1/15)...I am now getting morning erections at 50%  which is encouraging because I haven't had morning wood for over a year.  I don't know if I am permanently damaged or not?  I lost my wife over this a 6 months ago.  If in fact Rogaine caused my ED_ then the President of Pfizer should be castrated.  I will do it myself...I am so pissed. I will post again to help any others.... if and when I get my dick back.,M,53,4  years5% 2X D,6/12/2015Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

17, 1, ,Panic attacks_ Heart palpitations_ low blood pressure_ shaking hands,My son started Rogaine about 9 months ago. After taking Roagine for about 3 months_ he started to complain about heart palpitations and general uneasiness. He is a very fit_ slim healthy male. No medications_ no drugs_ no alcohol. Played three sports in high school. I did not connect Rogaine to this. His syptoms progressed until he a had a full on panic attack. We were all very worried. No history_ nothing. The only thing we could think of was the Rogaine.  He stopped using Rogaine and his symptoms seemed to disappear.  He wanted to try again so he started about three months ago and sure enough symptoms came back and another full on panic attack.  He kept saying he felt like he was going to die. Heart pounding out of his chest.  He is NOT a complainer. I googled Rogaine and panic attacks and this came up. We have since discontinued use as nothing is more important than your health.  Yes_ these symptoms are real. Very real. My son does not discuss his sexual health with me so I can not speak to that. I_ unequivocally_ do NOT recommend this product. I will report back in 3-6 months to let you know if he has had any other side effects or if things went back to normal.,M,21,6  months 1X D,3/2/2015Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

20, 1, male bald pattern,Loss of libido; erectile dysfunction; problems with ejaculation; heart racing; weight gain; itchy scalp; itchy body. This thing sucks_ rather keep my balls.,I'm 26_ very healthy and athletic. Have never been under any drug prescription in my life. After 45 days of using this awful medication_ I started experiencing some side effects such as heart racing_ itchy body and some other minor things that I noticed after I started using Rogaine. I wanted to think that the side effects where temporary and not severe_ but then I experienced my first ED during a one night stand. I became desperate and started reading about ED then remembered I was on this drug_ the only abnormal thing. After reading stuff here and in other places I finally realized I was losing my libido_ morning erections and had much weaker erections during sex with different partners_ apart from other side effects. I am 100% sure it is Rogaine_ because I wasn't even aware of the possibility_ so it couldn't be psychological. The side effects started slowly and made me think they were already there. Stopped using this yesterday_ lets see how long it'll take for ME to get back. PS. No hair improvement_ and I still have most of my hair_ but if it starts to fall out_ I'll simply shave it all off and keep my balls! I wish I had came across this website b4 I started. Want poison?

21, 2, Slow down balding,,To follow up_ I've made some changes and began seeing results: I've stopped using it 2 months ago and had seen very little_ if no change. So here's what I've done and beginning to see results:1) stopped the Rogaine. 2) began taking supplements - 	In the morning I take 2 500mg capsules of L-Arginine amino acid. This can cause an upset stomach/gas but has gotten better. 	Approx 350mg of Yohimbe. This_ combined with the L-Arginine is a natural sexual stimulant and actually works. Also an energy booster. Can cause excess sweating and make you jittery. Small price to pay. Just have to figure out what dose works for you. 	Zinc - Has some sexual health benefits and boosts immune system. 	Garlic- Odorless pills_ unless you want to smell like bad Italian food. 	One multivitamin - The B vitamins are key_ the rest doesn't hurt. Everything available through Amazon. 3) I've also lightened up on deodorant / antiperspirant with Aluminum in it. May not make a difference but doesn't hurt. Being winter_ just a little is enough right now. 	4) These issues started before I began taking anti-depressants. However_ I've stopped Zoloft and now take a low dose of Welbutrin instead. Welbutrin hasn't shown any sexual side effects that I can find. Hopefully soon_ I'll phase that out too. 5) I'm also phasing out Concerta 54mg I've taken for probably 10 years for chronic fatigue. Stimulants/amphetamines have actually increased sexual stimulation for people. But they start,M,43,5  years5mg 1X D,2/9/2015EmailHistory,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

Good thing was my hair looked better_ after initial 4 weeks my hair loss was decreased and after 12 weeks my hair density has increased significantly and existing hair looked thicker (both on front and back) and I was happy with the results but very unhappy with constant stomach pain and all the other side-effects I have listed. It was just 4 dark long months in my life_ due to all this crap I felt disconnected with everybody and I decided to stopped it.

But its not quite fine guys. All the hair that grow during the application is falling down and worse. I think what this medication does is to super elevate the hidden problems in your body_ it will help to diagnose possibly much bigger problems . Like I am doing now_ if u guys have too many side-effects please go to doctor and get a tailored or master health check-up. Note: Remember don't stop the drug in one day_ do it progressively meaning reduce the dose slowly from 2 times per day to 1 time per day and 3 times per week and once in a week and halt completely. This is suggested by the doctor. Still searching for alternate ways to fight hair loss_ wish use all good luck_ and hopefully one day we might have risk free solution.

I used it on frontal and temple region. Only it's affect on hair happened as told.First 2 weeks: Noticed nothing. Hairs were falling as usual.3-8 weeks: I started losing hair heavily and it continued for a month. Then small hairs stated growing in frontal region and hair thickness improved. But erections were less strong. Morning wood became rare. 8-10 weeks: Hair thickness seemed to improve a bit and those new small hairs in my frontal corners grew to a size of 1 cm. Hair fall stopped completely. Not a single hair lost i n a day. But erections became hard to get. Once even after my girl stimulated it with hands didn't get any erection. Could only get one when I was really relaxed.11-19 weeks: I panicked and started going to gym. Exercised 5 days a week. And reduced the doses of rogaine to once daily. Things improved. Erections are back but not as before. On the days which I exercise I get very strong erections but if I don't_ erections are weak. Semen volume and fluidity has decreased for sure. 20th week: 4 month supply is about to end and bought more for 3 more months. My hair now looks fuller but I am worried about I sex life. I am yet to get married and have kids. If I exercise_ eat and sleep well I get good erection after simulation. Random erection are gone.

46, 1, Hair Loss,Potential slight improvement to hair.  However_ experienced decreasing sex drive_ loss of morning erections (and the accompanying good kind of loin burn)_ soft erections_ some trouble getting erect for sex_ and interestingly_ started to have some premature ejaculation (couldn't hardly last).  Stopped taking it and immediate improvements in 3-4 days.  Feel back to normal after a couple of weeks.,This is need to know info for those new to it.  This all crept up on me_ particularly right after I was turning 40 and I thought an age bomb went off on me.

50, 1, Hair Loss,,Applied once a day at night time for about 5 months until I ran out. Experienced a huge dip in libido a week after stopping. I never considered that Rogaine caused my problems and so a few months later I started using it again; which was the worst decision I've ever made. After about 3 days I noticed I had no ability to maintain an erection_ sperm was like water and I suffered badly with PE. I stopped using it immediately (June 2013) and noticed very slight improvements in the weeks after - no PE and semen has gotten better in quality. Still_ 5 months on_ and my libido is quite poor and it's difficult to maintain an erection without consatnt stimulation - half mast at best. I seem to have maybe one good week were libido goes up to a reasonable level and I get the urge to watch porn but only for it to be followed by weeks of low libido. Mentally_ this has been really tough as I've always had a huge sexual appetite and had been very sociable with women. I really hope things improve. I'll make sure to update a few months down the road. Wish me luck.,M,25,5  months5% 1X D,11/2/2013Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
51, 1, fight hair loss,Hair filled in quite well but a total loss in libido. I thought it was due to me having diabetes and aging but after looking online I noticed it might be the Rogaine. I quite using it_ and after about 3 months_ everything returned back to normal_ with less hair though. Horrible drug and ED is clearly a side-effect but somehow the manufacturers were able to keep a lid on it.,Do not take it. No sense in having hair if you can't have sex.,M,30,9  months 2X D,10/29/2013,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

53, 3, Hair loss,I've taken it 18 years. It made my hair darker and a little thicker but it kept slowly falling out. My crown is nearly completely bald but I've continued out of desperation to keep whatever hair I have.  Even the best case study photos aren't really that great of result--you have to look closely just to see any benefit. I went to one dose at night cuz I hated the greasy look during the day. I wake up with bags under my eyes and itchy_ dry eyes. If I use the full dose_ I cannot sleep as my heart races_ so I use about a 3/4 dose. Recent complete loss of libido and lack of any meaningful results after so long have me quitting use. I'm now just clipping my hair with a 1 or 2 setting. It's been a few weeks and my eyes look better and I feel better. I never really noticed any sexual side effects but I've noticed an increased libido and spontaneous erections like in my 20s since stopping. I just chalked this up to age but perhaps the rogaine contributed to my decline.,,M,44,10  years,6/16/2013,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
54, 1, Hair thinning,I feel like I'm dying mixed with tripping on lsd  and doing a line of coke (I don't use drugs anymore  just occasional marijuana) I just remember how they feelI started using 3 weeks ago and started noticing I felt bad chest pains   heart palpitations and extreme anxiety (sweaty palms  severely)   my heart would race and now I'm off of the product I'm 3 days detox ed and it's still feeling worse then when I was taking it..  I've never had health issues.  But before taking it I had my my 30 yr old checkup on my heart   all perfect.    After taking this I want another heart test..  When i smoke marijuana it lowers my heart rate and blood pressure even lower... Stay away...  Do not use..  I'm healthy nd experienced every side effect except the lowered see drive...

55, 1, Hair loss,I think I chemically castrated myself with this stuff.  Not from the beginning_ but when I switched to a diff brand of Extra Strength.  My testosterone is in the toilet_ way below the low end of the normal range_ I don't wake up with erections any more_ I don't even think about sex.,"I stopped using about 3 mos ago and immediately started to feel better but I don't know if I'll ever recover fully.  I'm researching and employing all sorts of ""increase your testosterone naturally"" articles.  I know it is normal for someone my age to experience a decrease_ but this is beyond that.  On the plus side_ I am eating better and losing weight.",M,47,10  yearsNormal 2X D,6/6/2013Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
56, 1, Hair loss,Suffering sexual side effects for 11 months.  Libido is non existent & suffering with ED.  Never had issues before using rogaine. .  It took me awhile to figure it out rogaine was issue bc originally thought Zoloft could be main cause.  My urologist sees about 5 patients a year with men who suffer from rogaine side effects.   My blood work came back normal.  I see alot of people on site mentioned they seen the side effects disappear within a year soon after quitting .   Can anybody share their experience with me about recovering from side effects after 12 months off rogaine ? Much appreciated.,,M,38,1  years2x,5/28/2013Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
57, 3, Male pattern baldness,Mild head ache_ Libido shift_ I just take Aleeve for the head ache and cialis for the erection. Had a hair transplant and doctor recommended it. It does mess me up some. I do not think exactly along the same lines as I did without rogaine but i AM EXPERIENCING HAIR REGROWTH . I think the sexual side effects are probably different for each individual. I am just reorienting my thought processes and trying to find normal for me. My wife likes me better so that is a plus because even though we do it only once or twice weekly now rather than me driving her nuts trying to get into her panties every day things are lining out in some different but acceptable place.  I recommend trying 1/2 cap full once daily. It is less than the recommended dose_ in fact it is 25% of the recommended dose but it still works.,,,68,3  weeks5% 1/2 cap 1X D,4/28/2013Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

She started feeling very Anxious and pressure on her chest_ like she couldn't Breathe Then she started with panic Attacks. she also felt like she was in a fog. I called the Dermatologist and he said it could not be from the Rogaine. My Daughter has been off of Rogaine for only 5 days and she is feeling much better. I think this is a Dangerous product.
