0, 1, Hairloss,Poison,I'm a 24 year old heathly male with high testosterone levels and DHT etc_ just had it all checked. This drug completely ruined my libedo. I tried it twice_ each attempt was one year apart yet both times I had the exact same symptoms.Day 3 - 7 a surge in libedo_ feeling hyper and super aroused. Day 7 - 14 feeling pretty normal. Then after day 14 my sex drive disappeared. Can't get aroused even if watching porn etc. Orgasms also not as enjoyable.Please be very careful if you decide to use this drug. And don't even think about propecia_ that stuff is undeniably poison!,M,24,  1X D,6/22/2016,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

2, 1, hair loss,Poor libido_ lack sex drive.  Partial impotency,If you are a man and you think you need your hair more than you need sex I suggest you go for this drug BUT if you think you can't afford to lose even 0.0001% of your sex life then never imagine application of any drug from this company for curing hair loss. This drug is rapid sex life eliminator. I always get scared_ I just pray I recover. I just hope and pray.

5, 1, Stop/reduce receding hair.,Loss of libido_ weak erections_  Headaches and tiredness. It also caused urinating problems - I believe it was causing irritation to my pelvic floor muscles_ I even went to the doctor cause I thought I had an enlarged prostate. I stopped using it a week ago and all these side effects have gone. This stuff needs to be taken off the shelves!,,M,44,9  months,1/25/2016,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
6, 1, receding hairline,Began to see severe side effects by day 4! Fatigue_ difficulty with exercise routines I had previously completed with ease. Could barely(with a lot of work) get an erection. My thought process just slowed down. I could barely feel the effect of my ADHD medication(Adderall xr 20mg). I felt sort of depressed and sad constantly,It's too bad because even though the box said that it might not work as well for receding hairline(it's mostly recommended for vertex area) I could see some small improvements after 4/5 days of use. I decreased application to once daily to see if side effects would at least be tolerable but did not work. Then after taking 5 days off I began to feel better so I tried once daily every other day but still it was too much lethargy. Finally I just gave up. I reaaaally tried to make it work because I saw positive changes in my hairline rather quickly but the side effects are just not worth it.,M,50,16  daysfoam1/2cap 2X D,1/7/2016,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
7, 1, Hair loss,No question it's the Rogaine. I felt fine and as soon as I put it on_ I felt palpitations and anxious. It's completely made me feel very anxious and easily irritated and_ most importantly_ my blood pressure went up. Seems counterintuitive on a product initially meant to lower bp_ but for sure this is the only thing that's different. And as I said_ I noticed immediately when I applied it each night. So hair loss it will have to be. And I'm a woman trying to nip this in the bud but I won't sacrifice my health. Terrible.,I used the 5%. I don't think that's extra strength but that's where all the comments were located so I posted here.,F,50,3  days5% 1X D,11/10/2015Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

10, 1, Thinning hair,Update on my post of 6/12/2015,Was still not functioning properly...some morning erections_ but maybe 70% of normal. Re-tested for Prolactin and LH levels.  LH was 0 Prolactin 4.  Both too low.  My Endo rx was gaba_ glutamine_ l-arginine_ l-lysine.  I have also read the soy / soy milk can increase prolactin levels.  All of these have helped.  Seem to be able to function now with the help of Viagra.  Even Viagra did not help when hormone levels were down.  Keeping my fingers crossed that I continue to improve.

11, 1, thinning hair,Diminished libido_ less frequent/strong erections_ sore scalp with no hair growth,I just assumed my diminished libido was a consequence of aging_ though I am otherwise in outstanding physical condition. I never associated these symptoms with the use of the Rograine until I finally stopped using it_ only because of it's ineffectiveness as a hair restorer. Within 2 DAYS! I noticed a marked improvement in my sexual desire and function. I have no doubt that minoxidil can cause serious sexual side effects_ at least in some men. I also have no doubt that the drug companies knew this all along and should be held accountable.,M,62,4  years5% foam 1X D,7/9/2015,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

Besides those side effects_ I also noticed that my brain felt foggy and that I was not functioning up to my intellectual ability.  None of these side effects are listed on the package.

13, 1, Thinning hair,Complete Impotence_ Loss of Libido_ Can not ejaculate on rare occasions I could get erect.,I started using 2% Liquid Rogaine 20 years ago when I was 33 years old.  I was put on High Blood Pressure meds two years later.  Coincidence?  No ED problems until 4 years ago when I switched to 5% Foam.  Never put two and two together.  How dumb I am.  I thought it was old age and started using Viagra which worked very well_ so no big deal.  Then_ a year ago_ Viagra and the others all stopped working.  No explanation.  Went to an Endo.  Found my Total Testosterone was 225.  The minimum is 300.  I was 700 five years earlier.  My Endo got my Total Test up to 1700 which is crazy high.  I feel like superman_ but still can get my dick up.  This is killing me...Then_ I saw this forum.  I can't believe the Rogaine would do this.  However_ I quit the Rogaine 10 days ago (6/1/15)...I am now getting morning erections at 50%  which is encouraging because I haven't had morning wood for over a year.  I don't know if I am permanently damaged or not?  I lost my wife over this a 6 months ago.  If in fact Rogaine caused my ED_ then the President of Pfizer should be castrated.  I will do it myself...I am so pissed. I will post again to help any others.... if and when I get my dick back.,M,53,4  years5% 2X D,6/12/2015Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

17, 1, ,Panic attacks_ Heart palpitations_ low blood pressure_ shaking hands,My son started Rogaine about 9 months ago. After taking Roagine for about 3 months_ he started to complain about heart palpitations and general uneasiness. He is a very fit_ slim healthy male. No medications_ no drugs_ no alcohol. Played three sports in high school. I did not connect Rogaine to this. His syptoms progressed until he a had a full on panic attack. We were all very worried. No history_ nothing. The only thing we could think of was the Rogaine.  He stopped using Rogaine and his symptoms seemed to disappear.  He wanted to try again so he started about three months ago and sure enough symptoms came back and another full on panic attack.  He kept saying he felt like he was going to die. Heart pounding out of his chest.  He is NOT a complainer. I googled Rogaine and panic attacks and this came up. We have since discontinued use as nothing is more important than your health.  Yes_ these symptoms are real. Very real. My son does not discuss his sexual health with me so I can not speak to that. I_ unequivocally_ do NOT recommend this product. I will report back in 3-6 months to let you know if he has had any other side effects or if things went back to normal.,M,21,6  months 1X D,3/2/2015Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

20, 1, male bald pattern,Loss of libido; erectile dysfunction; problems with ejaculation; heart racing; weight gain; itchy scalp; itchy body. This thing sucks_ rather keep my balls.,I'm 26_ very healthy and athletic. Have never been under any drug prescription in my life. After 45 days of using this awful medication_ I started experiencing some side effects such as heart racing_ itchy body and some other minor things that I noticed after I started using Rogaine. I wanted to think that the side effects where temporary and not severe_ but then I experienced my first ED during a one night stand. I became desperate and started reading about ED then remembered I was on this drug_ the only abnormal thing. After reading stuff here and in other places I finally realized I was losing my libido_ morning erections and had much weaker erections during sex with different partners_ apart from other side effects. I am 100% sure it is Rogaine_ because I wasn't even aware of the possibility_ so it couldn't be psychological. The side effects started slowly and made me think they were already there. Stopped using this yesterday_ lets see how long it'll take for ME to get back. PS. No hair improvement_ and I still have most of my hair_ but if it starts to fall out_ I'll simply shave it all off and keep my balls! I wish I had came across this website b4 I started. Want poison?

21, 2, Slow down balding,,To follow up_ I've made some changes and began seeing results: I've stopped using it 2 months ago and had seen very little_ if no change. So here's what I've done and beginning to see results:1) stopped the Rogaine. 2) began taking supplements - 	In the morning I take 2 500mg capsules of L-Arginine amino acid. This can cause an upset stomach/gas but has gotten better. 	Approx 350mg of Yohimbe. This_ combined with the L-Arginine is a natural sexual stimulant and actually works. Also an energy booster. Can cause excess sweating and make you jittery. Small price to pay. Just have to figure out what dose works for you. 	Zinc - Has some sexual health benefits and boosts immune system. 	Garlic- Odorless pills_ unless you want to smell like bad Italian food. 	One multivitamin - The B vitamins are key_ the rest doesn't hurt. Everything available through Amazon. 3) I've also lightened up on deodorant / antiperspirant with Aluminum in it. May not make a difference but doesn't hurt. Being winter_ just a little is enough right now. 	4) These issues started before I began taking anti-depressants. However_ I've stopped Zoloft and now take a low dose of Welbutrin instead. Welbutrin hasn't shown any sexual side effects that I can find. Hopefully soon_ I'll phase that out too. 5) I'm also phasing out Concerta 54mg I've taken for probably 10 years for chronic fatigue. Stimulants/amphetamines have actually increased sexual stimulation for people. But they start,M,43,5  years5mg 1X D,2/9/2015EmailHistory,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

Good thing was my hair looked better_ after initial 4 weeks my hair loss was decreased and after 12 weeks my hair density has increased significantly and existing hair looked thicker (both on front and back) and I was happy with the results but very unhappy with constant stomach pain and all the other side-effects I have listed. It was just 4 dark long months in my life_ due to all this crap I felt disconnected with everybody and I decided to stopped it.

But its not quite fine guys. All the hair that grow during the application is falling down and worse. I think what this medication does is to super elevate the hidden problems in your body_ it will help to diagnose possibly much bigger problems . Like I am doing now_ if u guys have too many side-effects please go to doctor and get a tailored or master health check-up. Note: Remember don't stop the drug in one day_ do it progressively meaning reduce the dose slowly from 2 times per day to 1 time per day and 3 times per week and once in a week and halt completely. This is suggested by the doctor. Still searching for alternate ways to fight hair loss_ wish use all good luck_ and hopefully one day we might have risk free solution.

I used it on frontal and temple region. Only it's affect on hair happened as told.First 2 weeks: Noticed nothing. Hairs were falling as usual.3-8 weeks: I started losing hair heavily and it continued for a month. Then small hairs stated growing in frontal region and hair thickness improved. But erections were less strong. Morning wood became rare. 8-10 weeks: Hair thickness seemed to improve a bit and those new small hairs in my frontal corners grew to a size of 1 cm. Hair fall stopped completely. Not a single hair lost i n a day. But erections became hard to get. Once even after my girl stimulated it with hands didn't get any erection. Could only get one when I was really relaxed.11-19 weeks: I panicked and started going to gym. Exercised 5 days a week. And reduced the doses of rogaine to once daily. Things improved. Erections are back but not as before. On the days which I exercise I get very strong erections but if I don't_ erections are weak. Semen volume and fluidity has decreased for sure. 20th week: 4 month supply is about to end and bought more for 3 more months. My hair now looks fuller but I am worried about I sex life. I am yet to get married and have kids. If I exercise_ eat and sleep well I get good erection after simulation. Random erection are gone.

50, 1, Hair Loss,,Applied once a day at night time for about 5 months until I ran out. Experienced a huge dip in libido a week after stopping. I never considered that Rogaine caused my problems and so a few months later I started using it again; which was the worst decision I've ever made. After about 3 days I noticed I had no ability to maintain an erection_ sperm was like water and I suffered badly with PE. I stopped using it immediately (June 2013) and noticed very slight improvements in the weeks after - no PE and semen has gotten better in quality. Still_ 5 months on_ and my libido is quite poor and it's difficult to maintain an erection without consatnt stimulation - half mast at best. I seem to have maybe one good week were libido goes up to a reasonable level and I get the urge to watch porn but only for it to be followed by weeks of low libido. Mentally_ this has been really tough as I've always had a huge sexual appetite and had been very sociable with women. I really hope things improve. I'll make sure to update a few months down the road. Wish me luck.,M,25,5  months5% 1X D,11/2/2013Email,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

My crown is nearly completely bald but I've continued out of desperation to keep whatever hair I have.  Even the best case study photos aren't really that great of result--you have to look closely just to see any benefit. I went to one dose at night cuz I hated the greasy look during the day. I wake up with bags under my eyes and itchy_ dry eyes. If I use the full dose_ I cannot sleep as my heart races_ so I use about a 3/4 dose. Recent complete loss of libido and lack of any meaningful results after so long have me quitting use. I'm now just clipping my hair with a 1 or 2 setting. It's been a few weeks and my eyes look better and I feel better. I never really noticed any sexual side effects but I've noticed an increased libido and spontaneous erections like in my 20s since stopping.

It was the last thing I thought of_ I had stopped everything else I had been doing except for rogaine. I never even considered rogaine to be dangerous.

The best sex and sex drive I had had in years. It was only then that I really put two and two together. After years of use I discontinued over a month ago and my erectile problems and sex drive are slipping away.For a long time user the benefits were negligible_ get a hair transplant if you can and in the long run it will be cheaper.Overall I would not recommend this product.

65, 2, ,Gradual loss of libido_ ability to be aroused_ weak erections,Update to my post on 10/31/2011.  After being off the Rogaine for about 1 year_ my sexuality was back to about 80%.  Here is what got me back to 100 %: (1) I started trying ED drugs_ first Viagra.  The Viagra was of limited success but was still having issues getting aroused.  Then I tried the 20mg Cialis.  This had no affect on me whatsoever.  I heard about the daily use Cialis_ so I cut my pills in quarters and took one every other day.  After about 1 week I can say that it is working.  In fact_ I believe that this is my miracle drug. This is the closest I've been to my old self sexually. (2) I believe it was also helpful to visit internet sex sites occasionally to get my juices flowing so to speak.  One interesting result of all of this is that I used to masturbate with a lubricant but now this does not get me aroused. Now I do it without lubricant and it feels great!  The main thing is to get off the Rogaine if you are having the sexual issues.  And maybe Rogaine can still work with Cialis_ but I am not going to take that chance.  I lost my sexuality once_ and I believe I was lucky to get it back.,M,60,3  years75% normal 2X D,7/28/2012,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

I have never feel so bad in my life!! and the worst is that these synthoms all together are very difficult to diagnose. It would take many studies (and a lot of money!) and some luck to detect the real problem.

After 12 days of this_ I am back off the Rogaine never to return.  About 3 months after I stopped the Rogaine for a second time my sexuality is returning again with the help I believe of jelqing (look it up) and masturbating every other day_ although this was difficult to do at the start with the weak erections.  Now I am getting hard erections again and sensitivity/pleasure is returning.  If you have any sexual issues of this sort_ GET OFF THE ROGAINE.

96, 2, Thinning Hair,Heart palpitations and panic attacks.,"Ok_ I'm really pissed about this. I finally got off my ass when my friends started joking about the thinning spot on the crown of my head and started using Rogaine every morning. After two weeks I started having strange chest pains. Then a couple of days ago I had a full on panic attack on a Saturday morning while I was at a coffee shop a couple blocks from my house. I thought I had just over caffeinated myself and stuck to chamomile for a few days. Then I had another milder panic attack yesterday and have been having these weird ""zinging"" feelings in my chest and side. Mind you I am not a health nut but the only other time I have felt like this was when I took Wellbutrin. I really don't want to go bald but I can't keep having these panic attacks_ I feel like I'm going to die while it's happening and if it happens at work I don't know how I will manage to cope. I'm wondering if anyone else who had panic attack and/or heart palpitations got them with other medications as well?",M,31,2  weeks1 mg 1X D,2/15/2011,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

99, 1, rogaine extra strength foam,GREAT ANXIETY_ chest/heartpains_ increased resting heart rate_ complete sleeplessness_ headaches,Mother of God.  Thankfully I stumbled on this forum while doing a google search for 'rogaine heart.'  I thought I was slowly losing my mind.  I've been applying the foam to my beard area (my scalp hair is fine) hoping to see a fuller effect on my facial hair.  I apply twice daily and below the recommended 'half cap' dosage.  The first few days_ noticed no side effects.  After about the 3rd day_ I experienced a very severe headache.  I never get headaches.  About the 4th day in is when I started noticing my heartrate go through the roof.  It is now my 7th day in and I have gotten a total of 5 hours of sleep the last 3 days.  I'm discontinuing immediately.  I thought I was hallucinating_ but apparently I'm not alone.  The level of anxiety and heart palpatations at night really made me feel like I was going to die.  I would get a 'cramping' sensation in my heart region and have been on the verge of dialing 9-1-1.  Only one week in...no more for me.  I noticed a few new hairs in my beard_ but my health far outweighs any new follicle growth.  This is my honest account.  I would highly recommend anyone who is planning on taking Rogaine to really think twice and monitor your health closely.  I had no idea this topical foam could cause such things.,M,30,1  weekshalf a cap 2X D,1/7/2011,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

After like 8 months or so I decided to try again but this time I use only once and in the morning. I use 1ml all over the scalp and so far it seems to grow small hair in many areas of the scalp_ though they havent gone bigger or thicker yet. I will wait for 6 months or so and see how it works. Off late I am having lots of itchy scalp and dandruff. One more thing is I use only during the week days.,Once I skipped for a whole week and I had quite a lot of hair loss. It stopped within 2 days of using it again. For sure it helps stop hair loss and grows new ones_ for me so far. I will continue using it in low doses till I see some serious side effects. So far havent had any sexual side effects. I will be happy if I can maintain what I have for another 30 years :-).

I am a really healthy conscious person_ eatting organic taking supplements since i am a child. I went to a full liver detox_ colon cleansing_ and still i experienced these side effects.

113, 1, thinning hair,heart palpitations_ loss of sex-drive_ loss and soft erections,This drug causes these side effects 100%. I did not even know about the fact that it could cause impotence until I started having problems out of the blue after about 6 months of use. I researched it specifically afterward and found that it is more common than you would think. I stopped using it and was back to normal a few weeks later. I'm a paramedic and work with a lot of doctors_ they don't know everything about the drugs they prescribe. Pharmacists know a lot more about the individual drugs. As far as the racing heart_ that is a well documented side effect from the pills. The fact is that the foam is the same medication just in a weaker form. Most of us who use it do not use the recommended dosage_ we use a lot more and cover the whole top of our scalps. This brings the dose way up from what is recommended and can increase side effects.

My libido is almost down to zero.  I realize that a topically-absorbed_ low-dose medication of this type would not be expected to have this effect.  But it is not even understood how the drug works on hair growth(when it does)_ and it must be absorbed to be effective_ so clearly it enters the bloodstream.  My experience may be rare_ but I do not believe it is some sort of placebo effect.

129, 1, Hair loss,Before I write about the side effects I'd like to give background info.  I am 30 years old and am in very good shape.  I go to the gym 3 - 5 times a week_ get regular sleep and do not take any other medication.  All that info is important because I can conclusively say that Rogaine gave me severe anxiety and pain attacks.  I took this drug for a month and a half and could literally feel my blood pressure rise_ it was a terrible feeling.  During the first few weeks I experienced shedding_ which didn't make me happy but figured it'd be worth it if the drug worked.  The shedding continued and along with it was extreme anxiety_ my heart would pound and my head was all foggy.  I've read other reviewers say that these side effects are impossible_ well I can personally swear that they do.  I know losing your hair is highly undesireable_ but having panic attacks and anxiety is not worth it.  The only choice I see for myself now is balding gracefully since Propecia and it's side effects (ED),Even though this drug has FDA approval I'd be careful.

It doesn't alter hormone levels (that's propecia you morons)_ and unless you put an entire bottle on your scalp and let it soak in_ it doesn't cause anxiety or heart problems.  It's a vasodilator that allows for improved blood circulation to the hair follicles.  Maybe if you idiots stopped googling every little thing and just listened to your doctors advice you wouldn't be fooling yourselves into thinking you have every side effect under the sun.,M,30,1  years,3/14/2008,Rogaine extra strength (for men)
136, 1, thinning in top of head,I don't know where the one is for women. I am having heart palpitations and major anxiety with the womens rogaine. I just started applying it again 3 days ago and the palpitations started 2 days ago.  Didn't really notice until just now when they came again.  So I got on the internet and looked up anxiety ans rogain and I found this site. The thing is_ my DOC recommended it and now what do I do? Just want to let you guys know.  And the gals if any are reading this.,I actually thought about about using the foam.  Now... I'm having second thoughts.,F,29,3  days,1/21/2008,Rogaine extra strength (for men)

145, 3, hair loss,Rogaine worked great at first.  I had thinning in the front and it filled it in.  I never had itchy scalp - just those damn stains on my pillow and hooded sweatshirts.  About a year ago though - it all stopped.  I had horrible itchy scalp_ major dandruff and major hair loss.  It was like my body just started rejecting the Rogaine.  I'm still using it though only just once a day.  The itchy head is bearable - barely.
