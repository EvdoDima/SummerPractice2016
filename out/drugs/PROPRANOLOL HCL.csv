0, 1, Hypertension,Terrible headache. Nothing I take to get rid of headache from this drug works. My eyes hurt bad as well.,I was given 40mg taken twice daily but started slow with only 20. Thank God. The other dose would have been deadly. My head is killing me and we feel it's this drug. Going off this today and back to Topral 25mgs x2 per day.  I had high hopes for this new drug working better to lower BP but side effects are bad. I'll give Topral a longer chance,F,40,7  days40 Bid,8/3/2016,Propranolol hcl
1, 1, GAD,RAPID weight gain_ hair loss_ lethargy.,It slowed down the heart rate a bit_ but it also slowed down everything else! After 6 months of watching my weight go up (weekly!) no matter what I did and experiencing the other horrible side effects I listed_ I finally gave up and weaned off of this drug.   Don't take this if you don't want to gain weight quickly_ lose hair_ and feel tired all the time!  It's not worth it!,F,58,6  months30 1X D,8/2/2016,Propranolol hcl
2, 5, In youth_ migraines_ then BP,In my 20s and 30s_ 60mg propranolol ER made me dizzy_ so I had to take low doses of the short acting version. Later_ I also took it to reduce the intensity & cycle of panic attacks. Now_ it GREATLY reduces the frequency & intensity of perimenopausal hot flashes in addition to slowing the progression of renal disease.,Has been used very successfully used to treat PTSD_ but that treatment has a specific protocol_ INCLUDING at least 6 therapy sessions.,F,51,10  years160mg,7/10/2016Email,Propranolol hcl
3, 5, Headaches,If I take it during the day it makes my eyes burn as I have chronic dry eye to begin with.  Made me sweat terribly also.  Seems like it makes it hard to lose weight.....I am going to go off it and see if thats the culprit.,Totally gets rid of my headaches which I would wake up with if I take it at night.  Works very well even at this low dose of 5mg.,F,52,6  months5mg 1X D,8/24/2014,Propranolol hcl
4, 5, High B.P. & Essential Tremor,Don't really notice any.  Very pleased with this (5th) drug I've tried to control high blood pressure.,It keeps my blood pressure at a normal level and controls my essential tremor_ somewhat.  I tolerate this medication very well.,F,68,7  years80 mg 1X D,8/1/2014Email,Propranolol hcl

8, 4, High Blood Pressure,Tired during the day and difficulty going to sleep. Fitful sleep.,I'm on a very low dose. Dr. wanted me to take 40 mg 2Xday. On that dose I was light headed_ dizzy_ and fell down a few times. I adjusted my own dose. Drs. go by what drug companies tell them; you have to be your own advocate. I have tried a myriad of BP meds and most have side effects I cannot (or will not) tolerate. So far this controls my BP with tolerable side effects.,F,54,3  months10 mg 2X D,9/12/2011,Propranolol hcl

10, 2, Essential tremor_ anxiety_ high BP,Insomnia_ severe depression_ fatigue_ no energy_ bleeding gums,For tremor_ anxiety and resultant high BP_ my 60-mg propranolol ER dose did not work nearly as well as my husband's 80-mg LA dose which I previously had taken sporadically before I got my own prescription.  Also_ taking my own 60-mg dose on a regular daily basis gave me EXTREME insomnia.  I could only sleep 4 hours a night no matter how tired I was.  I tried an Ativan pill to conquer the insomnia_ and it worked_ but I just don't have enough Ativan pills to be using them every night for insomnia_ not to mention the addiction potential of Ativan.  The propranolol and resultant extreme fatigue/insomnia worsened my underlying depression significantly to the point where I just quit taking daily propranolol after about two weeks and got motivated to make an appointment with my MD to be put on an antidepressant which I needed anyway.  I'm reverting back to just taking regular propranolol_ not ER or LA_ on an as needed basis and will explore other options for the essential tremor and periodic hypertension brought on by anxiety.,F,51,2  weeks60 mg ER 1X D,4/20/2010,Propranolol hcl
