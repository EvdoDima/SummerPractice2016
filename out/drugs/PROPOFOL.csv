1, 1, Central line placement,Don't even know how to describe it except it was the worst worst hallucination_ but I felt it was so real_ experience than I ever had in my whole life.  Combo of propofol_ Fentanyl_ and versed.  I remember them putting me on the cart to wheel me back to the recovery room but I felt I was in a tunnel and people were talking but everything was distorted and I was spinning in a tunnel and I was on my way out of this world and I was telling God I did not  want to die.  I felt as if everything was compressing and spinning and I could not see and my mind was just going freaking nuts   It's been five days and I cannot even sleep because of what happened it scared me so bad,Whatever you just read_  it's not even close to the way it was I don't even know how to describe it except that I was dying even though I wasn't.  I felt as if I was leaving the earth to meet my maker and everything was shining in and compressing me,F,46,1  days,7/7/2016,Propofol

18, 5, Colonoscopy. I went out quickly. On,I was a bit drowsy for the rest of the day. Felt like my arms and legs were a little weak. Like I had done some major exercise that day or the day before. Which was not the case. Intact I skipped my daily workout. I was a bit irritated_ grouchy_ angry as I came out of the stupor. Maybe it was the drug.

19, 5, Colonoscopy,Uncoordinated until about an hour after the procedure. Slight nausea_ stomach pain_ sluring words and feeling  generally out of it and a bit confused.,I went in for my very first colonoscopy today_ I was up the night before with only about two hours of sleep altogether_ I was very weak and extremely nervous about the procedure. The anethesiaogist was very good at putting in the iv even though I think I was dehydrated by the time I got to the office. The last thing I remember is the nurse and anethesiaogist looking at me and giving me the meds via iv while explaining I may feel burning in the iv_ I remember feeling panicked almost to the point of crying then super relaxed_ next thing I knew I suddenly I woke up and was told the procedure was over and it was normal.  I took a nap before they took my final vitals and they the released me after about twenty minutes with my driver. I still feel a bit slowed down mentaly but otherwise normal. (I did tell the anethesiaogist before hand I was feeling extremely anxious and that I am on meds for anxiety.),F,23,1  daysunknown,7/1/2015,Propofol
20, 2, colonoscopy,I had a colonoscopy  a week ago.  I had propofol for the first time for sedation.  Everything seemed to go well except I remember waking up coughing.  When I was returned to my cubicle the nurse mentioned that I had spit up. I was allowed to go     home shortly.  I ate an apple and some nuts on the way home and drank water.  I did not eat lunch as the apple seemed to be enough even though I had been very hungry   before the procedure.  As the day went on I started to feel extremely cold.  My husband brought me several blankets and finally a heating pad.  Nothing helped the    extreme shivering and it started to make my lower back and hips hurt so bad I had to ask my husband for another heating pad  for my back. This went on for hours  before  I finally went to bed and finally warmed up.  Then I had a coughing spell and coughed up a quarter size blood clot.  I called the Dr. and he said to go to the emergency  room. But I had just read an article in the newspaper about a 5 hr. wait at t,I would be afraid to have this drug again and the doctor agrees that I should not. Seeing what others have said and recorded_ I realize I am not alone in having these side effects.,F,76, .? 1X D,1/22/2015Email,Propofol
21, 1, colonoscopy,"Seem to be having pain in my jaw on right side_ since evening after my procedure. Hurts to chew or clench my teeth...The worst thing about my experience with this drug was the psychological effect it had on me.  I had no pain when the drug was introduced into the IV_ and went to sleep very quickly feeling an extremely pleasant euphoria. I had vivid dreams_ a feeling of ecstasy_ sensations of pleasure and well being while I was ""out""; for about 15-20 min. based how long it took for my colonoscopy. I came to to the sound of my husband's voice_ which sounded to me then to be the sweetest sound I had ever heard...when in reality my marriage is in difficulty & relations with my husband are extremely strained. I vaguely remember my Gastroenterologist saying I was in ""fine shape""_ no polyps_ & that I'd done a good job with bowel prep. After dressing & recovery_ during which time I noted very low blood pressure & very slow heart rate on the monitor_ I didn't at first remember that I'd had a conversation with the Dr. I'm a recovering alcoholic & drug addict_ so the experience of feeling high & euphoric was not a peaceful or ultimately positive experience for me. I even said to my husband while just coming out of the feeling ""maybe I should start drinking again.."" not a rational thought for someone who knows the danger of taking the first drink or drug again. I won't be changing my sobriety date because of this experience_ but I would",,F,58,1  daysnot sure,9/13/2014,Propofol
22, 2, Colonoscopy,Anxiety_ migraine_ impulsiveness,Woke up from my procedure feeling freaked out_ jumpy_ angry and impulsive.  2 days later my anxiety is through the rough and I have a horrible migraine..Think I will ask for an anti anxiety med next time it's used on me...,F,40,1  times 1X D,6/9/2013Email,Propofol
23, 2, colonoscopy,delayed side effects started days after the procedure - severe neuropathy from lower back to bottom of foot_ calf muscle cramped so badly that it turned my left foot inward_ unable to straighten my leg upon arising_ had to force myself to walk to allow my leg to straighten. Chills_ waking up in the night with extreme dry mouth_ pain cycled approximately every 90 minutes_ excessive gas_ belching_ flatulence - after bowel movement or passing gas the pain eased somewhat. Dizzy forgetful - left water running for example. GI doctor told me not related to propofol_ i disagree - found clinical information that exactly described my symptoms. PCP doc said that it was the position i was in and prescribed stretching and muscle relaxers. I tried and they made the pain more severe. The pain is beginning to ease but has changed to what feels like deep bone pain. This is the fourth week of extreme pain - it does not allow me to sleep through the night.,"I know that propofol is highly recommended and works well for nearly everyone - the key word is ""nearly"". This is the second time I have had it. The first was for hernia surgery and now I realize that I had a delayed reaction to it the first time. The pain is severe - 10 on a 10 scale. I will request that propofol not be used on me again.",M,64,  1X D,2/20/2013,Propofol
24, 4, cataract surgery,anxiety post surgery lasted for weeks but I cannot say it was due to the Propofol. I am really quite hospital phobic so it could have been that.,I don't take any meds or drugs so any drug usually has a bad effect on me_ or at least a very strong effect. Propofol did not cause any post anesthesia vomiting which is a huge problem for me. I was drowsy but conscious through the whole procedure_ (two of them). I did not recollect any pain on injection nor for the actual surgery. I'd use Propofol again if I were ever crazy enough to enter another hospital.,F,72,2  days 1X D,9/3/2012Email,Propofol
25, 4, toe surgery,mild anxiety_ nausea_ dizziness,I've had this three times all with different experiences. First time was with colonoscopy where I slept through the whole thing. Next was another colonoscopy where I was awake through the whole thing but it was painless. Third was thumb surgery and I was awake for that with no pain. Fourth was toe surgery where I slept through it again. I'm not sure why I'm sometimes awake_ sometimes asleep. I don't have bad side effects from it though.,F,48,1  daysnot sure 1X D,6/21/2012Email,Propofol

27, 5, tear duct surgery,Brief period of euphoria.I have had propofol in the past_ which also produced euphoria.  The level of euphoria seems to be higher at higher dosages of the drug.,"I was having a procedure which usually requires general anesthesia.  I told the anesthesiologist that I wanted to be awake during surgery and remember it.  I was given 100 mg. of propofol and ""a little"" remifentanil_ which was enough for me to tolerate the surgery.  There were no problems at all_ and I can still recall most of the conversation in the OR.  I was SO pleased and surprised at receiving what I had asked for!  I told the anesthesiologist he was marvelous_ and he told me that I was marvelous.  This was my best anesthesia experience ever!",F,63, 100 mg. 1X O,9/10/2011Email,Propofol
28, 1, outpatient surgery,"I was told that an anesthesiologist would administer my propofol...nope_ a nurse (CRNA) did it and almost killed me..I stopped breathing_ my BP dropped thru the floor and the CRNA (just a nurse with 20 months of watered-down anesthetist schooling) just stood these and asked the surgeon to: ""help this guy"".....",don't consent to this drug with an unsupervised CRNA,F,44,1  days400 1X D,7/11/2011,Propofol
29, 1, colonoscopy,horrible experience_ could not breathe or communicate_ a chemical straightjacket,"my colonoscopy was possibly easy without propofol...with the drug_ my endo doc stopped the procedure because I was suffering significant propfol side effects...she yelled at the nurse (not anesthesiologist_ just a nurse crna)...""don't you know what you are doing?  his BP is dropping thru the floor and you continue to give him more propofol?????/ I was in equisite pain_ but the crna didn't know or care..............she just moved on to the next victim..........until my doc told her that we needed an anesthesiolgist for propfol_ not a nurse..at least my colonoscopy and any crna services was free.  I would never get another colonoscopy with a xrna...even if I was dying.",M,56,1  days 1X D,5/8/2011Email,Propofol

32, 1, Anesthesia for Upper Endoscopy,Inability to pass urine; grogginess; dizziness,My dad was given Propofol for a 15-minute upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) [examination of esophagus_ stomach_ and duodenum with an endoscope] in an office setting_ instead of the standard sedation. He woke up groggy and couldn't hold his head. Then_ he couldn't urinate. His bladder was distended but he couldn't squeeze out a single drop. Fortunately_ he is smart and he drank two cups of black coffee (no milk). That helped a lot and he was able to urinate. Yet_ he was not himself for the rest of the day. He was coughing a lot. It was a lot of trouble that wasn't worth it. People_ beware. Make sure you are not given Propofol when your procedure doesn't require it. Tell doctors point blank that you want sedation and not anesthesia. Propofol is an anesthetic agent. Don't get caught like my dad was.,M,74,0  days,3/24/2007,Propofol
