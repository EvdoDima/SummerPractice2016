0, 5, For depression,Positive side effects only: some slimming_ some rise in libido.  At this dose I did not follow an MAO diet and had no problems.  (All on doctor's advice.),It works for depression for me.  It has been by far the best thing I have found in over 30 years of trying a great many things. .  DOWN SIDE - the different pill formulations are NOT the same - no capsule form has worked for me_ which I had to discover via laborious trial and error_ and I believe there has been a recent change in the tablet as the effect diminished with the last refill -- I am somewhat more depressed - and there is also a negative change in the texture of my hair_ which has become wispy.  (A similar thing happened to me years ago when I took Wellbutrin.)I am unhappy with this change_ and imagine it affects patients taking the medicine for other reasons too.  I think that the original makers of the med stopped making it in factor of making/selling Emsam patches_ which are much more expensive.,F,68,10  years15 mg day 1X D,10/22/2011Email,Selegiline hcl
1, 4, parkinson,I talk_ laugh_ sing_ shout_ even teach  in my sleep_ while I'm having very vivid dreams. Husband tolerates it_ wakes me_ and we resume sleeping.  (We warn houseguests in advance.),My Dr. tried to change me to a different med_ but after only   3-4 days without selegiline_ I had trouble walking_ worsened tremor_ jerking shoulders_ and anxiety. Dr.put me back on selegiline quickly_ and I'm doing as well as before.,F,68,8  years5 mg 2X D,12/31/2010,Selegiline hcl
2, 5, Neurological symptoms,None whatsoever.,Post quadruple by-pass I suffered chronically from what is best described as electrical discharges in my brain. This was also accompanied by loss of confidence at driving_ of heights_ and in general. I also suffered numerous mini-blackouts. Selegiline effectively controls those symptoms but regretfully does not appear to cure the problem. There appears to be a connection between my heart and my brain (obviously) and I suspect those neurological symptoms could be due to minor heart-attacks which this drug effectively controls. I discovered those benefits through reading the literature and had to battle with the GP/MD to have them prescribed rather than having to purchase from the Internet.,M,79,16  years,12/30/2009Email,Selegiline hcl
