I used to have extremely painful muscle tension in my back_ which would cause me to vomit for a minimum of 8 hours. The tension in my back was insane.

Urinary incontanence_  two kidney stones. I think I have all the Rare/Severe side affects.,I took Baclofen for 10 years_ starting with 60 mg/day. I worked up to that dose under a Dr's guidance. It worked well for muscle spastiscity for about 5 years_ then things started to go bad. At first_ I had such weakness in my legs that I couldn't move_ so I cut back to 40 mg/day. Then stiffness_and anxiety along with incontinance. I had no idea that all this was from the Baclofen! I just thought it was because I was aging. This past May things EXPLODED. I woke up swollen_ (I blamed it on hot weather before) my hands were pink and swollen so much that I can't use my thumbs_ and my fingers are stiff. I cut myself down to 30 mg/day and was working on weaning myself off the stuff_ but things got so bad that at 20 mg/day_ that I just stopped the drug. I felt so awful; anyway_ I can't say I noticed a difference. The left side of my body is more swollen that the right_ and my current Dr. is thinking Lymphedema_ but my symptoms don't add up. I don't have the money to be throughly checked out. I'm currently taking Prilosec because I take 1200 to 1600 mg Advil/day_ and Oxazepam 15 mg at night.

47, 5, Left leg muscle jerks/spasms,Initially I was very tired and almost stopped taking it after a few days because of this.  I then started taking half the recommended dose and ramped up from there over a couple of weeks and the drowsiness was much more tolerable.  I still get tired_ but not nearly as bad as during the first couple of weeks I was on it.,I love this drug - it has given me my life back!  My severe leg spasms/jerks have mostly cleared up now.  It seems like it took a good month to get the full benefit of being on the drug_ so stay with it if you have muscle spasms/jerks and have been put on Baclofen.,F,41,45  days,2/22/2009,Baclofen

56, 4, dystonia_ muscle spasms,fatigue_ bizarre dreams_ trembling/tremor if I miss a dose_possibly nausea and abdominal pain but I'm not sure if this is related to the drug,I have noticed that when I increase the dose I get fatigued and very tired but after a couple weeks this side effect goes away.  I have some gastrointestinal problems (nausea and abdominal pain/irritable bowel syndrome and gastroparesis) that may be exacerbated by the baclofen.  If I miss a dose I get trembling and shaking all over almost like I'm shivering but I'm not cold.  Overall the baclofen has been the only drug that remarkably helps my dystonia.  I am better able to walk and I don't need to use my wheelchair as much.  I definitely get more twisting and spasms when it is time for my next dose or if I miss a dose so I know it helps quite a bit.  I took Baclofen for 3 years and stopped to get pregnant.  Now I am taking it again and it has been about a year.  I take 20mg 3 times a day and I have taken as much as 80mg/day without severe side effects.,F,30,4  years,6/18/2007Email,Baclofen
