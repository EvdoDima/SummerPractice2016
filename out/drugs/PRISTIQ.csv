1, 1, Situational depression,"-Measurable ""flat"" feeling- Lack of emotion- Low-grade_ constant depression- Complete lack of creativity- Horrible_ life-threatening withdrawal symptoms described below",Please_ if you are even considering Pristiq at ANY dosage_ reconsider. Contact me if you need additional information. As a high-performing_ educated motivated and highly socially active female and professional_ this drug took away nearly 5 years of my life. I tried to get off of the medication nearly ten separate times with a doctor's help_ and I became a severely depressed_ suicidal_ barely-functioning person who was so physically sick for so long that I lost a job_ nearly all of my friends_ and every part of the person I loved and respected (myself).There are HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of similar forums out there with patients just like me_ who had the same (or worse) experiences. This is a drug that has created MORE depression and far more problems for me than it ever cured. At the very least_ spend a few days researching online --- the accounts of Pristiq nightmares are overwhelming. If I can help even one person say no to starting Pfizer's Pristiq_ I will feel that my own experience was worthwhile.,F,42,4  years100 MG 1X D,7/7/2016Email,Pristiq
2, 5, depression,Headaches and fatigue first 2 weeks.  Small weight gain.,"I am very happy with Pristiq.  I feel happy and content.  Nothing bothers me too much.  I tool Welbutrin before and it caused heart palpitations.  So far so good on Pristiq.  The only thing I wish it did was give me a burst of energy.  I have gained 10lbs. While taking Pristiq but it is because I feel so happy and comfortable.  I just don't care!  My mentality is like ""yes_ I would love dessert!  Life is great!  Life is about eating dessert!"". I wouldn't mind this if I wasn't already overweight.",F,41,4  months50mg,6/25/2016Email,Pristiq

4, 2, Depression_ mood swings_ anxiety,I decided to quit Pristiq a week ago because it wasn't working for me. It seemed to work really well for the first month_ but after that it began to wear off. I decided to just quit it cold turkey before I became more dependent on it. The withdrawal symptoms were not nearly as bad as lots of people had experienced_ but still not fun. For about 5 days I experienced vertigo when moving my eyes too quickly_ occasional brain zaps_ and I also felt a dissociation from myself. Only because I've been off them now do I realize what they did to me. I was so numb to emotions_ and I didn't really care about anything. Which was good for my anxiety_ but bad for my depression_ as it made me not care about my life. I'm really quite angry that my doctor just gave these to me. I told him I was having mood swings and depressive episodes and he just gave me a months worth of trials for free. I saw two doctors and neither of them screened me for any mental illnesses_ instead they just took my word and wrot,,F,18,4  months50 1X D,5/27/2016EmailHistory,Pristiq

7, 3, Depression / Anxiety,While on the drug:  initially_ I noticed no side effects - I had been on Effexor and was switched to Pristiq because of insurance issues.  The last year and a half I felt flat_ didn't care about anything.  I'm currently in the process of weaning off_ and THOSE side effects are pretty bad.  Nausea_ vertigo_ night sweats_ bizarre dreams_ angry about everything.,This company seriously should be ashamed of itself when it comes to people weaning off.  They know you will experience withdrawal and make nothing lower than 50mg_ and tell people not to cut the pills because it is extended release.  Pfizer_ I'm talking to you!

He was addicted and thought he couldn't live without it. Our marriage is ruined and it has affected his health. I did wean him off about a year ago and it was a long hard process. Had to do it myself as his GP laughed at me when I told him about his changed personality. He was becoming a lot more like his old self but I think he is back on them. His old behaviors are back. And his health is going down hill again. To me this drug is poison and I would say be very careful .Withdrawing is like getting a drug addict off of drugs.,M,45,4  years50mg 1X D,2/17/2016,Pristiq

I have a feeling that just these two alone_ at the prescribed dosages will be just what I have needed.  The lights went completely out for me on Nov. 30 and I've been hiding out ever since_ bed all day and night_ not bathing_ barely cleaning_ fits of hard crying and rage.  I was put into PHP at a hospital and finally feel like I have a voice in the management of my illness.  I was currently taking Lexapro_ Wellbutrin_ Klonopin_ and Vyvanse.  I'm hoping that the new meds will eventually ease the depression and sadness as well as keep me focused so I won't have to take so many like before.

I couldn't sleep_ just had to concentrate on my breathing all night. I was terrified.,I only had one dose! I took it at night as suggested by my doctor. I woke about 3 hours after taking it in a weird_ electric atmosphere_ my head was buzzing. Then the burning tingling sensation started and lasted on and off for approx 10 hours. This was the most awful night. I felt like I was trapped in a state of panic induced by the drug. Confused_ scared. Over 12 hours later I still feel very very anxious_ racing heart. I was advised to go to emergency_ but I've just been chatting with my nurse sister. A drink is helping me calm down. Now I'll need to miss work to go back to the doctor. This increased my anxiety and panic 10- fold. Horrible. I think it's too strong for me. Or wrong for my condition. I'm hoping it'll be out of my system soon.,F,34,1  days50mg,11/7/2015Email,Pristiq
21, 5, Major Depressive Illness,- Changes in libido plus ED (these have since gone)- No other side-effects,"Without doubt PRISTIQ changed my life - and I am grateful for a chance to say so on this forum. Best I do it in point form:- over 30 years of prior major depressive episodes (suicidal thoughts and attempts_ multiple hospital admissions_ electric shock treatments etc etc)- started on 50mg once-daily_ March_ 2009 when depressed and suicidal (again)- felt unbelievable signs of decrease in depression and suicidal tendencies after only one week- continued feeling better and better- breakthrough depression at six months - dose increased to 100mg daily- stayed on 100mg for 12 months- asked Doc to reduce me back to 50mg daily as a 'test' because of changes in libido and ED (erectile dysfunction)- have remained on 50mg daily since- NO depression- NO suicidal thoughts- just one happy and grateful person at age 57 (and I fathered a new addition to our family in 2013 - a healthy daughter born in 2014!)- life is so good today - I feel like one of the 'normal' peopleP.S. as for libido and erection problems - I wanted to 'test' the 50mg dose again and whether libido/ED side-effects would settle down (they did) - BUT - and it's a huge ""but"" - I was willing to stay on 100mg if need be and live with unpredictable libido and erection issues - my wife and I wanted me to stay ALIVE much more than have an alive penis!",M,57,6  years50mg 1X D,10/27/2015Email,Pristiq
22, 1, Major depression,Brain fog:- inability to think clearly_ very sore tongue_ yawning all the time_ eye pain_ dry mouth_ weight gain (10lb while on this)_  sleepiness and unable to drive.,It seemed to work at first but it was probably the placebo effect. I became very irritable and not myself  at all. Small things irritated me immensely -  like my partner  finishing dinner before me and leaving the dining table - - this was enough to spark a major argument and thoughts about divorce. Totally inappropriate reaction. Coming off it gave me severe headaches and the way it is formulated made it difficult to taper off as well since the slow release effect is created by the pink film coating. Cutting the tablets in half to reduce dosage causes the slow release effect to not work and gives a high spike of the drug. The half life is only 11 hours so after half a day the withdrawal symptoms kick in with force. Glad to be off this.,M,60,3  months50mg,10/21/2015,Pristiq

Unfortunately I lost my job and my insurance.  I get the Pristiq when I can_ which isnt very often as the price is so high.  When I dont have it I'm back to the crying_ staying in my bedroom and having suicidle thoughts.  I had some Wellbutron left and I take that when I dont have the Pristiq.

35, 1, Posting on behalf of my father,Worsened anxietyWorsened bipolarExtreme detachmentSuicidal ,I am so happy I found this site after seeing what happened to my father (in his 50's). The reviews that come up when one googles this drug seem completely misleading until you dig a bit further. My father was switched from Lexapro to Pristiq for his bipolar when Lexapro stopped working. What happened after a few weeks was enough to scare the whole family and every acquaintance of my fathers. It was like he was a walking zombie with no feelings other than negative and irrational ones and turned verbally aggressive to everyone. His lows were lower than ever_ and his manic highs were returning. How can one drug such as lexapro work so well (before tolerance sets in)_ and pristiq do so much damage. In the end the only choices left were to either have him admitted to get help and commence legal proceedings against the manufacturer_ or have him come off willingly. Luckily_ after a few devastating incidents caused by his behavior to friends and family - he agreed to come off the drug. Coming off the drug however has posed new problems that never occurred with Lexapro. All that matters is that he has finally listened to the family about his destructive behavior on this drug and we are all slowly working together as a family to get some stability back. I still don't understand the adverse reaction when other antidepressants worked fine for him. I have a really uncomfortable feeling that the true dangers of this drug will not be made public for years until a class action is filed.,,54,4  months150 1X D,4/7/2015,Pristiq

Within a month I was back where I started. Dr upped the dosage from 50 to 100. My blood pressure and heart rate went crazy high. Dr then put me on 50 one day and 100 the next. It was still too much and wasn't doing anything for my original symptoms. I was finally down 50 every other day. After about a month of that I quit. My gp said it was bad for my heart. The first 30 days after I quit were really wonderful. I don't remember ever feeling that happy. Then I basically crashed. I feel worse now than before I started.

At the beginning I did notice that it surpressed my anger but when I forgot to take my tablet for three days the anger I had surpressed came back 10 fold_ today out of the blue I snapped and started screaming at my partner for no reason at all I kicked holes in my bedroom door_ called him every name under the sun_ punched him in the chest three times and even picked up a fan and almost smashed him in the face with it before I weirdly snapped back out of it and fell into an anxiety attack almost instantaneously laying on the floor crying and breathing shallow quick breaths_ my doctor did not tell me that pristiq could make me have sudden violent outbursts.

The most irritating side effect so far is the swollen throat_ its horrible and I hope it goes away.

I've been on just about every antidepressant out there for the past 20 years and this is the first one that made me gain weight! Only 10 pounds but I'm short and it shows. I have body image issues and this was the last thing I needed. Doc cut my dosage in half to see if the weight would come off. Argh! I keep a food and an exercise diary and I know this weight gain has nothing to do with my habits. Apparently it has slowed my metabolism.,I may just ask to go back on Cymbalta. That was weight neutral for me.,F,38,9  months100 mg 1X D,3/3/2014Email,Pristiq

I tried to wait it out hoping the side effects might diminish once the drug has taken full effect_ but they have not gotten any better_ and I am afraid this is a deal breaker for me.,I am thinking at this point_ I will need to try another medication_ which is a shame because they worked well for the depression but the side effects are just too much.,F,51,6  weeks50MG 1X D,2/18/2014,Pristiq

Pristiq sat on my bathroom counter 3 days before i could bring myself to take yet another anti depressant. First day i no longer cried_ i actually laughed again. By day 4 i went hiking with boyfriend and watched the leaves fall off trees and enjoyed it. Now at week 2 i feel like im coming back to my old self. Been depressed for over 2 years with major anxiety and major social withdraw. Best time for me to take medication is at 10 pm right before bed_ sleep off any side effects except low sex drive although i had that before medication_ i lost 5 pounds so far from medication.,F,42,2  weeks50mg 1X D,10/30/2013Email,Pristiq

Went off the Pristiq.,Pristiq worked for the 2 years. Went from 100 down to 50 mg._ adding wellbutrin. Then went off Pristiq. This has been a rough few weeks. I have read many comments on the side effects of those going off this drug. I was relieved to hear that I was not alone. Dizzeneness_ light headed_ tearful. If I moved my head to quickly_ the side effects were worse. Taking a migrane otc one time a day. This seems to help me. Starting week three. I am determined to get off this crap. Pristiq is much more powerful than it is portrayed. So to those of you struggling_ keep in touch with your doctor_ and fight through. I believe that it will be better for me to get this out of my system.,F,57,3  days50 mg 1X D,9/14/2013,Pristiq

Pristiq has ruined my sexy life with my wife. What once was 3 to 5 times a week has become 1 to 3 times a month. Your tablet is a joke and I am very pissed off about it. It should be pulled from the shelves. You put your trust in a product and cost me a fortune to be on it and its ruined something else in my life.,,M,30,6  months50mg,8/21/2013Email,Pristiq

I have had NO positive effects even after waiting months and increasing the dosage. If you value your well-being please DO NOT take this medication! I know of NOBODY who has had positive results. Not only that_ now I am stuck on it as I attempt to wean off of it. You can't break the tablets and the smallest dose is 50MG.

I tried Lexapro_ Celexa_ Prozac_ Wellbutrin (still on it)_ but Pristiq was the only AD that brought me back to life.  Ive only been on Pristiq for 9 days but I feel alive and energetic and myself.

95, 4, Depression/anxiety,Hair loss_ weight loss_ flat affect after while,Overall this was not a bad drug for me..I lost weight (22 lb) but the hair loss became noticeable and my moods flattened out after about 7 months. I went off of it only because the price was so high after the Pristiq discount stopped - even after insurance my copay was just too high. One thing to know about any drug like this is for the first few days/weeks you are going to feel a little bad - it's manageable. As far as dose - start low - it's better to go up then try to come down. If you decide you want to stop the medication I suggest asking your doctor to give you a week or so of Prozac to help.,F,46,9  months50 mg 1X D,6/25/2013,Pristiq

The side effects at 100 are far worse - the drowsiness and tinnitus are far more noticeable and there was no pain relief at the higher dose either.

I ended up going off it ""cold turkey"".  I just was not functioning when I absolutely had to.  I have fibromyalgia so when the pain of that gets really high my serotonin levels plummet and depression sets in again so both my natural predisposition to depression and the fibromyalgia feed off each other so I need to be on anti-depressants permanently.  Nothing much was working for me when I was home caring for my bed ridden dying father who I just absolutely adored.  My Dr. changed my medication.  He also managed to kill my father so I should not have expected he would do me any favours either.  Pristiq nearly killed me as well.   Just don't take it.

100, 4, Anxiety_ Depression,The first 2 weeks were hell. I threw up the first 2 nights and was having alot of trouble sleeping. My mind was racing_ i was nauseous and unable to concentrate.  I had the jitters and was very shaky all the time.  I would sweat so badly at night my pillow was soaked and i had to get a towel.  I began locking my jaw while i slept which caused migraines and alot of pain.  My sex drive does not exist any more. Most of these symptoms went away accept the locked jaw lasted a few months_ i still sweat at night but not as bad_ and my sex drive is still dead. My new side effect is exhaustion. The last few months i have only ever wanted to sleep.,Despite all the bad side effects_ which mostly went away_ this drug has been a life saver. After about a month of taking it i remember walking my dog on a sunny morning and actually feeling happy again. It was amazing. It took another month or 2 for the depression to finally lift. I still have a ways to go and the recent exhaustion is hard on me_ but it lifted the depression enough for me to be able to get back to my life and make changes to help myself.,F,27,5  months50 MG 1X D,3/27/2013Email,Pristiq

107, 5, Anxiety,At first it was a rough go switching from Vibryd to Pristiq_ but I think it was because the Vibryd was not at the levels I needed. Therefore I was already at a low and needed to come off of Vibryd and build up the Pristiq. The first 2 weeks I experienced some weight loss (yeah)_ an internal vibe that drove me nuts_ not quite the jitters though_ slight headaches_ naesea. i stuck it out though and am glad i did.

NUMB. I want to give this some more time_ but my world is spiraling downward.......,I've been reading comments with so much honesty & emotion_it's quite frightening.If you want your experiences to be counted & documented_this is a great avenue to help others_ but remember to contact the FDA to report ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS!!! Otherwise_ all of our wisdom & consequent suffering in way too many instances_ won't be heard & the drug companies continue to profit by other's suffering!

112, 1, Bipolar_ depression_ rapid cycling,Severe and acute florid MANIC episode on this med. I do not recommend at all for Bipolar l. Be VERY wary of the noradrenergic effects! Florid dreams. Have  now stopped and substituted an SSRI without the the noradrenergic effect. Make sure you are under specialist med supervision during any *changeover*!,Do not take ANY alcohol with this med. From my own experience_ I feel this med should be contraindicated for Bipolar_1 patients. I experienced  a brief but heightened frightening manic episode on this med. Other meds i am on included: Seroquel 350mg/day_ Lamictal 200mg/day_ Diazepam prn.... I feel it is the noradrenergic effect that led to the acute manic episode. My later switch to an SSRI without that NA effect_namely citalopram-GA. (Celexa) helped me so much more__ as well as having a beneficial effect on my GAD. My warning is that desvenlafaxine and Bipolar 1 do not seem to agree. At least >> that's my personal experience.,M,54,20  days25 1X D,12/17/2012,Pristiq

I find that if I forget to take it (and/or can't afford it in time for the next month) within two days I am EXTREMELY irritable_ I can't see my vision gets so foggy_ and I am so tired and anxious that I can't think straight.  Although I am now experiencing some negatives_ the first 9 months of taking the medication have helped me immensely.

I also cant seem to enjoy sex with my husband_ but alot of wifes these days have that problem :).my only true complaint is how tired I seem to be and have difficulty holding my weight. I_ unlike others taking this medication_ have a problem loosing weight on pristiq. I simply dont want to eat anymore and my stomack had problems holding too much food aswell. But all in all i have to say these problems are far less of a problem than my life time of destress.

127, 4, Depression and Anxiety,Slight nausea during the first week_ sweating_ head feels thick at times and slight chest tightening.  No sexual side effects.,I have taken Pristiq four different times since 2008.  During the last six years_ I have experienced episodes of depression due to stressful life circumstances.  I can honestly say that Pristiq helped my depression_ especially the first time.  A month after starting it in 2008_ I felt completely normal with absolutely NO anxiety.  A WORD OF CAUTION: Withdrawal from Pristiq is notoriously difficult!  It helped me with depression but withdrawal needs to be gradual.  DO NOT stop taking it cold turkey.  I tried that (I know_ stupid on my part) after several months of taking it in 2008.  The withdrawal effects of stopping cold turkey included awful brain zaps and mood swings.  Withdrawal over a two week period was nowhere near as bad.  However_ be ready to deal with your body resetting and adjusting to not having the drug.  I wouldn't call it a miracle cure.  Personally_ I view antidepressants as a temporary solution.  The right drug can help as long as the antidepressant effect exists and the side effects are tolerable.,M,40,18  months50 MG 1X D,9/8/2012,Pristiq
128, 1, Depression/Mild Anxiety,first couple of weeks seemed ok_ experienced some memory loss but attributed that to the Valium I had started at the same time. Now the Valium is a thing of the past_ and so is my memory. I cannot remember anything! literally impossible to book an appointment and show up on time_ my keys are lost_ my wallet is regularly lost_ remote always lost_ 3 pairs of sunglasses and 3 hats lost. Some of these items show up for a day or two_ then are lost again. My sex drive is zero_ I have had strange episodes which have been quite hallucinatory_ my vision is often shaky and now I have started getting 'zaps' also. I'm confused and feeble minded_  from a normally high functioning person. I have had strange violent thoughts when waking_ that I quickly forget_ that make me wonder what's going on in my head while I'm sleeping.,My doctor never warned me about the dependence issues associated with this drug and I'm not happy. I'm scared to come off it and not sure about how to do it. I keep booking appointments at the doctor_ but missing them because my memory is so screwed. I can't cook food for my family properly any longer as I cannot properly multi-task. I even forget to pick up the kids from school! I don't know what to do with myself unless I drink strong coffee or something_ anything to pull me out of this haze.

Energy level was better & not near as tired_ fewer vivid dreams.  After 3 yrs. of counseling it was time to take the leap and see if I could manage without - life situations improved GREATLY!  Started by decreasing from 100 mg to 50 mg a day.  Was on that dosage for 3-4 months.  Then decided to completely discontinue.  Pristiq is not available in a dosage smaller than 50 mg - the starter packs might have a 25 mg_ but I could not get that through my prescription plan.  Anyway_ instead of 50 mg every 24 hours I switched to 50  mg every 36 hours.  my doctor wanted me to do 32 hours_ but then I would of had to get up in the middle of the night to take med.  I stayed on this schedule for 2-3 weeks then increased the time in between doses to 48 hours - again did this for 2-3 weeks then increased to 60 hours in between doses for 2-3 weeks and then 72 hours.  Once i got to this point i noticed that the interval was too long in between doses and I was having more exaggerated ups and downs - the downs being the worse - lots of crying and lack of concentration.  This was the week before Easter Sunday and i had a couple days off so I figured I could be home and just quit.  I am proud to say that was the best decision I made.  No_ it wasn't a picnic - was irritable_ angry_ emotional_ upset stomach_ diarrhea_ and a few other side effects.  I experienced that ZAPPING feeling that people talk about - so strange!!

The first time I took it I noticed almost immediate weight gain. This was over the course of almost a year. I went off the medication and noticed my weight start to decrease. My doctor put me back on the medication about six months after I went off it because I experienced some family trauma. I gained all of the weight back and then some. I have to say that I am more depressed being on the Pristiq than not. Mostly_ due to the weight gain. I have always been thin all my life and contribute my weight gain 100% to taking this medication. Over the past few months I have put myself on a diet and increased my exercise and that has not helped. The scale does not change no matter what I do.

My cardiologist isn't sure what caused the tachycardia. They are currently doing tests and monitoring my heart.,My psychiatrist and cardiologist wanted to see what affects my heart so they put me on a heart monitor for 30 days. I'm on week one and they quickly tapered me off pristiq (4 days of 50MG then none). It has been HELL. I can hardly function. These are my withdrawal symptoms: anxiety_ blurred vision_ concentration impairment_ crying spells_ dizziness_ fatigue_ highly emotional_ irritability_ lethargy_ increased headaches_ nausea_ over-reacting to situations_ repetitive thoughts or songs_ stomach cramps_ troubling thoughts (suicidal)_ vivid dreams_ and worsened depression. This is only day three being off pristiq_ so I have no idea how long these will last but it is terrible.My docs want me to go on pristiq during week 2 of my heart monitor and back off for weeks 3 and 4_ but I am going to refuse to start it again because I know I will feel awful during weeks 3 and 4 if I go on and back off that quickly. My husband thinks I should go back on because it helped my depression_ but if I ever have to go off in the future (which I don't want to be taking it forever anyway) then I am not sure if I will survive.

The 2nd week my muscles started to get really really sore to the point walking across the room was exhausting and made my heart pound and then I would be in utter agony because every muscle in my body ached so badly. A couple weeks after that my jaw started locking up and I started getting very intense headaches that no amount of pain killer could help. But I'd started 2 other meds so I had no idea this was the one causing it. So my doctor finally just took me off this one. She tried to wean me off of it by putting me on a low dose of effexor for a week but this withdrawal is no picnic. Dizziness_ brain zaps_ irrational anger and can't sleep. But my head aches are far less painful and my muscles are getting a little better hope the other problems start to clear up. This definitely needs to come off the market!

I could not sleep and slept 2 hours that day. Normally I rush around trying to get stuff done. I didn't want to do ANYTHING. I sat in bed all day and didn't care what I did_ what I had to do - I didn't care about my kids_ about my boyfriend_ about me... I questioned why I was even alive (although I wasn't suicidal at all... just felt pointless). I pretty much had a complete lack of emotion and motivation - I felt like a complete tired zombie/robot.

I felt really anxious even after 6 weeks on 50mgs tried going up to 100mg and neally took myself to the emergency department! It increased my blood pressure daily and increased anxiety!

The weaning from Pristiq has been TERRIBLE. I have had extreme dizziness_ memory loss_ sensitivity to light_ extreme irritability and anxiety. I was told by my MD that it caused the low blood pressure and light headedness that caused my to lose conscienceness and wreck my car. I advise extreme caution tapering off of this drug. I have not found many medical professionals who prescribe Pristiq. The Cleveland Clinic advised me that they do not prescribe it.,I do not recommend this anti-depressant. I've been on many of them and have never experienced the side effects when stopping any of the others like I have Pristiq.

I have been off this **ing drug for almost a year_ and I am still experiencing withdrawl symptoms/ my body is just getting back to normalcy. When I was on Prisitq_ I think I had a SEVERE allergic reaction/ every possible side affect to the drug. The fucked up thing is how new this drug is_ that my symptoms don't seem to matter and/or measure up to any scientific stats. However_ this is what I know.... I have been diagnosed with depression since I was 18. I am now 21_ and before Pristiq_ I faced a 7 year battle with bulimia_ which i overcame. The whole reason I was put on Pristiq was because I was actually doing well and overcame a huge battle with eating disorders_ yet still felt the depression. My so called Doctor put me on Prestiq to help my low energy and chronic depression_ when in all actuality_ my doctor put me on a new anti-depressant so she could make bank_ while i was sent back to CA_ where I went to school (had to withdraw bc of Pristiq) --- my story is complicated and long_ but one fact holds true- PRISTIQ ruined my life. As a young woman of 22_ with a 7-8 year history of anorexia/bulimia_ I am currently going through Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from a drug that was suppose to make me BETTER. I cannot in any way compare how awful the few months on Prestiq were to my life long battle with Eating Disorders.

I remembered so many details. I was on a high for 2 days just thinking about the possibilities if this was going to happen again. I loved that dream ( I was backstage at a concert with so many interesting people ). I didn't remember a dream for a few more days - then I had my first ever nightmare. I am 40 years old and this was a major shock. I am still wound up about it. I have read about others having violent dreams as a side effect of Pristiq.

Do not let a family doctor Rx it---find a good Psych Neuro. My Neuro said the drug is so new_ they have NO IDEA what problems it causes.This drug will kill people--plus it was never developed for this use; look up Ellefore_ which originally was sold as a non hormonal replacement for menopausal woman.

207, 2, Depression,Four days after I started taking Pristiq_ the skin on my fingertips began to peel off. I told my therapist_ saw a dermatologist and an urgent care specialist_ and they all told me the Pristiq could have nothing to do with it. It continued to worsen_ and the solution my dermatologist assured me would work didn't even slow it down. I lost three layers of skin from all my fingers - it bubbled and peeled down to my palms. I stopped the Pristiq and the peeling and skin condition in general has vastly improved. I know this reaction is probably VERY rare_ but I'm just putting it out there in case it happens to someone else and their doctor tells them the same thing mine did. Unfortunately_ the medication DID seem to help me emotionally_ but the finger peeling was definitely a reason to switch. Withdrawal was unpleasant.,I think this medication would definitely help some people_ and I wish it worked for me.

My moods changed on a daily basis. I began having anger outbursts out of the blue_ throwing things_ slamming doors and yelling at anyone who got in my way. I cried hysterically for no reason. I began to hate the job I actually normally love. Everything irritated me. I have now stopped taking the drug and went back on Celexa.

I never suffered from anxiety or panic attacks prior to taking this med.  I gave up after ten days when I got tired of not being able to get anything done at work due to the irrational anxiety.,This drug worked great for depression if it wasn't for the prolonged anxiety.  I felt great_ had tons of energy_ and it did not make me drowsy or yawn.  Maybe if I had been able to stand taking it long enough the anxiety would have passed_ but the duration of the anxiety made it too difficult to continue to take the medicine.,F,34,10  days50 mg 1X D,8/1/2011,Pristiq

At first it did make me feel better and i did survive the situations that were causing me immense grief and stress at the time.  So yeah_ it helped.  But I have to say that during the time I took it_ I also developed major problems with my bowels including IBS and diverticulitis.  Maybe it's a coincidence_ but since going off my meds_ both have improved drastically.  Going off has been a nightmare.  I am at one full week off and still experiencing dizziness_ restless leg syndrome (and no I didn't have it before and don't take anything else to cause this)_ nausea_ cravings for sugar. I have heart palpitations both with and without it now(yes_ I've been checked and nothing shows up).  I'm having severe cramping in my fingers and toes.  And my arthritis seems to have doubled in intensity since I have begun to ween myself off of it. I have experienced a major weight gain although I have been trying to diet and exercise regularly so I fully believe the no weight gain is a lie.  I can't say that I wouldn't take it again if recommended but I would have to seriously consider it as it doesn't seem that the side effects are worth it_ or are the withdrawal side effects worth it.,F,53,1  years50mg 1X D,7/31/2011,Pristiq

After 7 days on this drug I am going off of it before the horrible withdrawal symptoms kick in that I'm reading about. Hopefully I am stopping it before that happens. I do not recommend this drug.

After that_ it has gotten progressively worse. I feel like I'm losing it and I'm getting off this stuff as soon as possible. I am convinced that none of us truly know how much harm these prescriptions are doing to us long term. I feel like this has really screwed up my brain and my body.

241, 3, Major Depression,Headaches_ Nausea_ Dry Mouth_ Tingling (Only Dry Mouth was persistent 24x7),Pristiq was the first anti-depressant I ever took in my life after falling into a deep depression in Fall 2010. It took 34 days to work well enough to cure my depression and take an edge off my anxiety. However_ I had to add Buspar to truly feel better (I strongly believe my depression was caused by my intense anxiety). Eventually_ the doctor switched me to Paxil (an SSRI_ Pristiq is an SNRI) since it also works to help alleviate anxiety and panic attacks related to social situations such as public speaking. It took approximately 8 days to withdraw from Pristiq... I suffered from severe brain shock sensations whenever I moved my head and at random_ and I was extremely irritable. I strongly recommend you ween yourself slowly off of Pristiq as I could not imagine doing it 100% cold turkey. Though I stopped 'cold turkey_' Paxil still works on some similar Serotonin receptors in the brain_ so it was not as bad of a withdrawal as it could have been. I strongly recommend that you give this medicine time to work_ as it took over a month for it to start making me feel 'happy' to be alive once more...,M,21,4  months50mg 1X D,3/16/2011,Pristiq
242, 1, Major Depression,Had been on Effexor 375mg for 3 years_ then titrated off.  Later_ depression and anxiety returned.  Doctor insisted Pristiq was exactly the same but better. Started at 100mg.  Two days later rise in anxiety plus agoraphobia (new) had me bedridden.  In response_ doctor raised to 250mg_ insisting this wasnt due to Pristiq.  After 3 months disagreeing_ demanded Effexor.  The anxiety subsided and the agoraphobia diminished.  Was then able to get out of bed.,As with all medications that deal with brain chemistry_ everyones experience is going to be different.  In my case_ these side-effects were visible in two days_ and though highly regarded in the medical community_ it was that particular doctors arrogance that extended the suffering.

Things roll off my back alot easier now_ I handle situations with more emotional stability and am much less anxious.

Tried too many meds to list. Nothing helped. Within a week of starting it I felt like a new person. For the first time in my life I woke up in the am & didn't cry. The ""strangest"" time for me was when I realized that I felt hopeful & didn't want to die! I have gained quite a bit of weight but doc says it's not from the Pristiq (?). Unfortunately there are extreme withdrawal symptons if I miss even 1 pill. ""Disconnected"" feeling is the worse. Barely able to function until I take another one. It's a little scary to think of how potent this drug is. Everybody's experience is different.  Everybody's body is not the same. For me the amazing changes in my depression far outweight the chance of missing a pill and having side effects (I just make sure I have extras with me to take just in case).  I know 2 others who have taken it and had the same great results.  I know 1 other who it did nothing for & she had a scary time going off of it.",F,31,14  months100mg 1X D,2/4/2011,Pristiq

The reason I started taking this medication was because I was broke up with my ex fiance. We were engaged and together for 6 year. I couldn't take the pain_crying all the time_couldn't bare to even wake up in the mornings. This drug ended up being a miracle for me except for side effects. In the begininning_ I always felt dizzy_ I would forget things_ felt trapped in my own body. It took about 2 months untill I the side effects started to go away. It only took about 2 weeks for my depression to stop. In fact not only did it take away my depression_ the crying stopped_ I felt alive again. I wasn't stressed out anymore. I have been a very shy and quiet person all my life and this medication has given me courage and postive thoughts I never thought I would feel. I am dating someone new now and unfornately at some point I will need to get off this drug. If I stop taking this drug for 2 days_ I have severe crying spells for hours at a time and I get angry with mood swings going up and down.

271, 1, Depression,During it's use_ I could not easily distinguish any_ since I was taking two other drugs for on the same days (2x Adderall for AM & noon_ and 1x Clonazepam for late PM). But after I quit taking it (about only 20 days later)_ I experienced a major-heavy withdrawl that induced even heavier feelings of depression_ anger_ and distress than I ever had before. (I really can't recall the amount_ but I think it was 30mg).,Withdrawing from Pristiq was VERY BAD. Pristiq didn't do much for me within the 20 days that I took it_ so I just stopped cold-turkey. Bad idea! About 1 day after I stopped taking Pristiq_ I could not help but to feel deep despair along a worsened form of my depression. Contributions of these bad feelings were mostly because of an unwanted divorce that occurred 4 months prior to starting Pristiq. The physical withdrawl was deep crying for nearly 30mins straight_ a need to curl up in the fetal position_ and body trembling. During withdrawls (which recurred on 3 more days) were incidents of sudden screaming out at the top of my lungs that were of: grief_ anger_ despair_ remorse_ anguish_ among others... It's scary to know that such a drug had forced these emotions and feelings out from inside of me in such an unusually powerful and quite disturbing way. I advise NOT to take Pristiq if your depression is not that bad_ and to try something safer that has more history. It's better to try something that's safe and proven effective_ than taking a substance that has the potential to make an already bad situation 10x worse_ and that can potentially induce or increase suicidal thoughts or motives. +Your better off temporarily very sad_ then forever dead. !++++ Seek safer alternatives for God's sake!,M,29,20  days30mg 1X D,11/8/2010Email,Pristiq

Went down to 25MG second night_ but side effects were still awful. Stopping the drug. Severe nausea/gastro distress_ inability to eat_ food tasted weird. Headache_ altered mental status_ very spacy and out of it. Was hard to drive. Couldn't think properly_ cognitive impairment. Disoriented_ confusion. Increased Anxiety/Depression. Feelings of terror_ despair_ hopelessness. Not sleeping or sleeping as well_ waking up too soon wired and anxious. Exhaustion_ inability to focus and concentrate. Bleary feeling_ mind feels very uncomfortable. Agitated_ jittery feeling. Very nervous_ have to keep doing things. Heart beating hard_ dizziness. Difficult to function on this drug.

Very stressed and scared.,Also experienced diarrhea_ muscle twitching and tremors_ shakiness_ short term memory loss/forgetfulness. Felt like I was going crazy. This drug hit me like a sledge hammer!Just overall extremely uncomfortable side effects_ causing suffering. Terrifying going through this. Only took for 2 days it was so bad. Hoping it wears off soon_ but severe effect mentally and physically. Some minor benefits_ but not worth the excrutiating side effects.

289, 4, Bipolar 2,This medication has kept me from my depressed cycle_ where I was suicidal.  At 50 mg it did not have many side effects.  I had gone completely off all meds and lost 45 lbs.  but5 with the 50 mg. I stopped losing.  Then when we went to 100 mgs._ thinking it would help with my anxiety_ I actually couldn't control my hunger and gained 20 lbs and my cholesterol_ which is extremely low naturally_ shot up to 269.  I am going back to 50 mgs._ but this has been the best med for me at this time .  Wish they would find something that didn't make me gain weight and struggle with high cholesterol - I feel like Alice in Wonderland!,After reading the many other comments_ I would have to say that everyone seems to be different and you will not know if this is for you until you try it.

290, 3, Depression (bipolar type 2),Weight gain_ panic attacks_very vivid weird dreams & fatigue,Since starting Pristiq it has definitely improved my mood and I feel quite good but the longer I stay on this medication the more side effects seem to be taking place. Fatigue is a big factor_ I am tired all day and constantly want to sleep.  It is ruining my weekends because of the naps which last for an average of 4 hours! This is after a 9-10 hour sleep at night. When I am asleep the dreams are very real and weird and it really unsettles me for the rest of the day because I keep thinking about them. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between what was real life and what was the dream because they can be so similar. More recently I have started to have panic attacks when meeting people which has never happened in the 15 years I have had depression. I have been physically sick_ dizzyness and unable to speak when out in company because it feels like I am in a tunnel looking out and can't hear people speaking. The weight gain is bad. I have gained 18 pounds and this is with me really cutting back on alcohol (only about 2 glasses of beer/wine per week)_ counting calories and going to the gym 4 times per week.  I feel like the side effects are now becoming too bad that I will have to change meds even though my mood had improved - the depression is creeping back because of my weight gain.,F,36,9  months200 1X D,9/19/2010Email,Pristiq

I take Pristiq for anxiety - although it has not helped 100% with the symptoms_ it has helped me a great deal - it has given me lots of confidence and motivation which I lacked before. I don't have depression_ but I have noticed that I am HEAPS happier too! I think it's probably due to the confidence etc boost :) yay! P.S.

This has been the best combination for me_ but it took some time to find the right dosages.  My psychiatrist told me that it would take about 6-8 weeks to feel the full benefit of Pristiq_ and I am glad that I stuck with it.

I was on Effexor (which worked) and then my psychiatrist switched me to Pristiq because it was being marketed as the ""side effect free Effexor.""

The withdrawls from this medication is horrible and unbearable...I intend on getting off this med to something more effective at my next doctor's appoitment.  I would suggest to anyone given this med or any medication_ do your own research on the medication both postive and negative before you decide to let it mess with your brain.  My doc is an idiot and also told me that all antidepressants were the same.  I can't see how any medication having such severe withdrawl symptoms (discontinuation symptoms) can be good for someone's body or state of mind. I have 3 little children who are all under the age of 6 years old who are dependant on me there mother to be coherent_ and capable of being mentally and emotionally there...and with this drug since I have taken it...I can now see how it has messed up my life_ taken me away from things I love_ and enjoy.  I seriously regret this medication...look into withdrawl symptoms before you decide to start taking a medication such as this. So that you are aware of what could happen if this medication doesn't help you and you need to get off.  Furthermore_ regular MD doctors who haven't specialized in these types of medicines should never be allowed to prescribe them...it should be left to a phychiatrist or a type of psychologist who is able to prescribe medication.

Doc suggested 50 mg Pristiq and am trying that with the 1 mg of klonopin.  The OCD / anxiety / depression / slight ADD all seem to be taken care of.  The thing that is curious about this med is now it seems like the 1 mg of klonopin makes me over-sedated and my bad habits of drinking coffee and smoking - which seemed to have helped ""stimulate and focus"" in the past now seem as though they are not needed - will get over sedation feeling in the morning_ head-aches_ and some over stimulated agitation throughout the day when using these in pre-Pristiq quintiles (pack of smokes a day and drank coffee on regular basis throughout day).

I have backed off the Klonopin to one .5mg per day. I actually can tell when it is time for my Pristiq as I start getting a little shaky.

After that month it seemed to start having an opposite affect on me.  I became more annoyed and seemed to have more anxiety than before.  I will say it did help in the beginning but once my body got used to it_it only proved to be a nuisance.  My doctor diagnosed me with situational depression.  It has been a few rough years.  Now I feel much better and have taken myself off the medicine completely.  Luckily I had no withdrawals when coming of it_ other than sleep issues and I gained a few pounds.

These withdrawal symptoms became intolerable if dosage missed in 24 hours. Tiredness within 30 mins of dose_ brain fogginess_ short term memory loss and loss of concentration.Attempted moving to 100mg tablets during several periods which resulted in increased stress_ agitation_ frustration and heightened aggression.,Was very good within the first few days of helping me get work done and focusing_ but these benefits faded after the first month. It was successful in relieving the depression_ however_ the side effects of withdrawals/discontinuation during a 24 hour cycle are very unpleasant. The weight gain is another cause for concern and certainly doesn't help with maintaining a good psychological state.I used to take Pristiq in the morning_ but found that within 30 mins or so of dosage that I would feel tired enough to sleep. So_ I changed to a PM dose which had the side effect of helping me sleep and made my performance during the day better.I would love to come off this medication but considering I have withdrawals even during my daily dosage cycle_ I am really hesitant to go down this path without having time off work and some other therapy/medication to relieve the symptoms.I would recommend anyone considering this medication to avoid unless all other medications had failed - and I wish I had never started them in the first instance.,M,31,1  years50mg 1X D,7/10/2010Email,Pristiq

I'm sure I missed something.,I have a LOVE/HATE relationship with Pristiq.I first started on 50mg. The initial side effects were pretty tough to deal with_ but somehow I pushed thru. See side effects for what I had to put up with. But once those started to taper off life became easier to deal with but not quite up to par. So I had my doc increase my dose to 100 mg. My moods have come to a nice middle point. Not many highs and not many lows. Yes_ many times I felt FLAT and the majority of the time I felt extremely UNmotivated and no matter how many hours I'd slept...it was never enough. However_ I wasn't on the floor in a crying heap wanting to stab my eyes out for no valid reason. It was easy to justify staying on the med for those reasons.  Now_ my life is in a much better place than it was when I needed an AD. So I'm ready to try and come off of it.  I tried doing it cold turkey last week without any help...all I can say is....****DON'T DO IT!!!!!***** The dizziness alone was unbearable.....but top it off with nausea_ blurred vision_ stomach cramps_ crazy vivid dreams_ hot flashes_ cold flashes_ crying spells....the list goes on.

Then_ one day_ brutal muscle spasms/pain/tightness in left neck_ shooting through head_ accompanied by crushing fatigue. When reported_ doc stated that that was a common side effect. Now you tell me? Was prescribed Prozac (brand) to offset the discontinuation effects. Exp. mild body shivers when changing postion of eyes and felt bugs crawling under my skin_ to the extent that I jumped out of my shirt one day_ because I thought I felt a roach or beetle! Oh_ and IMMEDIATE hair loss (top AND bottom) by day 14. It took Cymbalta at least 3 MONTHS before going after my hair!,Diastolic BP skyrocketed into the stroke zone.

Stopped on Sat_ and still diastolic still in the 80's.

Doctor was going to start me on Effexor but only had samples of Pristiq left. I have noticed a slight lift in my mood but_ anxiety is more pronounced than usual and I'm so easily irritated and fly into angry rages way too easily (especially since I have a 5 month old and a 23 month old to take care of full time and work from home full time as well). I don't know if it's due to Zoloft w/drawals or if it's just not helping... I know it hasn't even been a week but_ I feel desperate for the anger to stop!!

356, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ Severe Fatigue,Pristiq is great but I have had side effects.  The first week or two of taking pristiq were a bit difficult_ nausea_ dizziness_ tired_ runs_ blurry vision (but keep in mind I was swapping anti-depressents therefore some of this would have been withdrawals as well).  After 6 moths the side affects have come and gone and also changed.  First few months was lack of appetite _ then heaps of energy which later levelled out but I do find it hard to sleep at night.  mild increased appetite_ hair loss_ decreased sexual drive_ mild overheating_ mild headaches and mild ringing in the airs.  My bowels also don't move as often.  Good side affect is that it has cleared up my acne which seem to be a result of stress and hormones or hormones causing stress that caused acne.... So in other words I believe the Pristiq has levelled out my hormones.,I was taking luvox for a number of years and swapped to Pristiq.  I wish I had done that sooner... I obviously have a fair few side affects but the side effects I have listed are fairly mild.  For instance yes I find it hard to sleep of a night but I feel fine in the morning so its ok... Yes I get headaches but nothing a nurofen won't fix.  I was very interested to read about the hair loss and ringing in the airs as this has just started for me even though i have been taking the drug for 6 months now.... I find that the side affects come and go such as the headaches and appetite changes.  In saying all I recommend Pristiq.  Pristiq has done what I need it to do and that is_ feel normal again.     I don't have the major symptoms_ that I had as a result of depression.  I don't have severe fatigue anymore_  I don't have severe nausea and throwing up.  I don't dwell as much_ don't cry and actually enjoy life and don't have to force myself to do things.   My anxiety is much better and moods are much better as well as my overall confidence in myself to cope.  I was very hesitate to change from Luvox to Pristiq but I am so glad I did as Luvox was just ok where as Pristiq has really made a huge improvement to my life.  I will see the doctor about my hair loss and ringing in the ears even though the ringing is mild.  I also want to mention that it has cleared up my acne so much that I barely have any at all.  Thats a bonus side affect for me!  Pristiq is worth a try.,F,30,6  months100 1X D,2/24/2010,Pristiq

I was spaced out in a big way_ very heavy limbs_ a headache_ blurry vision that made me want to blink to focus all the time and just a strange out of it feeling,I got scared after 3 days of feeling so out of it_ and stopped taking it. It's now been a couple of weeks and I'm still waiting to straighten up and get my clear head back. I know they're meant to take a few weeks to feel the full benefit and I think I did feel a bit more indifferent to the problems in my life on the 3rd day_ in a good way_ but I don't know if I'm comfortable with the way I might feel when I've got commitments at work and can't afford to be a space cadet. I've got depression and anxiety issues and never taken anything else before. I feel like I want to but I'm afraid of losing my mind or just getting on the whole med go-round thing.

371, 2, Depression,I first started taking pristiq when I told my Gynogologist I was starting to feel down because I was going through the change and was starting to feel pretty blue and she recomemnded and prescscribed pristiq. The first 4 months taking pristiq my depression was gone completely. I could even sleep at night which was good because I couldn't sleep anymore.My dreams were  very vivid which was a very cool side effect that I acually liked. The The  bad side effects were intense. Headache_ blured vision_ iching_ skin irritation under moles which started bleeding_ no interest in sex and when I did have sex I had difficulty having orgasm ( which sucks)  Sooo i decided to stop taking after 4 months. You would think side effects would stop but they didn't. The side effects worsened and continued for about 2 months after I stopped. I had head zings and was very dizzy. The worse thing about the whole experence is the reason I started  taking prestiq_on a scale of 1-10 about a 4 rating depression.Now,,F,53,4  months,1/14/2010,Pristiq

373, 1, Brain wave disorder--seritonin drop,Severe constipation-totally blocked upper intestine--pain level resembling long-term stage 3 labor.  Magnesium citrate_ enemas_ laxatives did not work.  It took a tube procedure to unblock the upper intestine and it occurred two more times until discovered that the Pristiq casing which does not digest but goes through your system as a small sponge the size of a small marshmellow was the culprit in blocking my upper intestine.  When taken off the medication cold and quickly_ I went through severe withdrawal--severe vertigo_ nausea_ shakes_ sweats_ flu like symtoms and feelings of passing out along with crying spells.  I still have a bit of hissing in my head and shakes which should subside within the next few days.  This is by far the worst medication I have ever taken.  I do not usually experience much in the way of side effects and the ones I do have been mild.  I took the lowest dosage available.  I can't understand why an extended release pill was not placed in a dissolable capsule,I have been on low dose medication for 20 years.  When I become ammuned_ I have been switched to other medications.  Pristiq was the medication from hell.  Within six weeks I found myself in the ER three times for a blocked upper intestine.  Magnesium citrate and enemas did not work.  It took an very invasive procedure to unblock the upper intestine.  The pain was as intense as 3rd stage labor.  It took three visits to ER with morphine to reduce to pain and lots of colon cleansing to release the blockage.  Pristiq is a hard tablet with a casing that swells up like a sponge about the size of a marshmellow that is supposed to be released through your colon.  Mine blocked it entirely.  It took magnesium citrate_ enemas_ a tube intervension and then 64 ounces of Go Lightly to finally release all these casings from my upper intestine.  Then I had to go off medication and went through the most severe withdrawal with severe vertigo where I could not even move my eyes from side to side_ shakes_ sweats_ flu like symtoms.  It took four to five days to return my system to somewhat normal.  I still have some hissing in my head and shakes which I hope will eventually subside.  I am_ in general_ a very healthly person with no colon issues and no health issues.  I would never recommend this medication to anyone after the last three weeks of pain and withdrawal I have had to experience.

374, 1, Depression and OCD,Severe depression_ suicidal thoughts and mania,"Was on Prozac and switched to 50mg Pristiq. The first week of transition between the 2 drugs was great!!!!  However_ it only lasted a WEEK!  My Dr. continued to raise my dosage in an effort to get me back to how I felt the first week however I never got there.  He increased me to 200mg (saying that he had some patients on as much as 300mg).  He agreed to reduce me back down after seeing worsening results.  Though this was a slow transition_ I still had severe withdrawal symptoms such as suicidal thoughts_ severe depression_ worthlessness_ mania_ etc.  As a last ditch effort to feel normal again I opted to go holistic.  I also have ADHD and purchased the book ""Prescription for Nutritional Healing(at GNC) to learn more about how to treat ADHD naturally but later realized that Anxiety_ Depression_ Manic Depression and even Schizophrenia were listed in the book.  The book is user friendly and list out the vitamins that you should and should not take and the reason why.  It also lists the essential foods that should be eaten and avoided.  Example: It states wheat should be omitted completely because it has been linked to depressive disorders.  Luckily_ I was told of Psychiatrist who also prescribes vitamins (because it helps the body absorb the meds) to assist me in weaning off Pristiq.  He mentioned that Pristiq could cause mania.  Not good for me because I already had those tendencies.  There is question as to whether or not I have a mild case of bipolar however the",F,35,6  months,12/22/2009,Pristiq

When I wake up in the morning I don't have to talk myself into getting out of bed and immediately start my daily tasks. But the side effects are hard to ignore. I am most concerned with the increased bleeding during my period_ which was once very predictable.

The nausea is something I have never had a prob with on any med_ so it is highly annoying.  I will keep it up though.  I have been bulimic for nearly 17 years_ and the good thing about this drug is that it doesnt make me hungry so I am no triggered in that sense.  I dont know what to think with anything.  I have been agitated and suffer extreme social phobia and have been in therapy for a few years.  I just want the anxiety to ease up a little bit and nothing seems to work for very long_ or the side effects just get the best of me.

Dizziness in its prime form.,Pristiq generally helped me stay in emotional balance; well_ somehow. It has/had an effect of a box ring. My evil and bad are in diagonal corners ready to start a fight and Pristique keeps them in their corners. It doesn't eliminate them_ it just delays or cancels the fight. Nice. However_ I am afraid of becoming dependent on this drug. So_ I discontinued taking it while having my period (thinking I am on safe ground for a few days or so). Oh_ my God! First day I got so dizzy_ that I fell on the floor and had to stay there for a while until the Earth was safe to walk on it again. Completely dizzy_ not like a hang-over dizzy_ but like you feel the gravitation and need to hold on to something. I was standing up only so I can throw up and then was lying on the floor again. At work_ in my office. Today is the 4th day and I am still dizzy. However_ I had a cafe latte to center myself somehow and be able to perform my tasks at work (haven't had coffee in 2 years). And I cried a river - all these 3 days; can't stop from crying. The evil jumps from the corner and makes me say mean things to my child (I called her Stupid - for the first time).so_ Pristiq?

Gave up all my hobbies and basically disconnected from life.  This was by far the worst 8-months of my life...I missed them and I can't get them back.  Pristiq may work well for some but for me it didn't.  Please please please...if you are having any of the side effects I experienced talk to your doctor about getting off Pristiq.  There are other meds out there and you can be happy again.,M,34,8  months,10/14/2009,Pristiq
416, 4, Severe depression,none,I've been on more antidepressents than I could name here. Pristiq was the first one to work right away. The only reason I would have given it a higher rating if I were on 100mg instead of 50mg_ but finance is a problem. I don't cry everyday anymore and my suicidal tendencies have gone way down. Just a tid-bit of info_ Pristiq is the same as Effexor except the part (called the Polymer) which causes the majority of the side effects has been removed. It's the same thing for celexa minus the polymer which is called Lexipro.,F,42,2  months,10/13/2009,Pristiq
417, 5, Chronic Major Depression,Decreased Libido,I'm taking Pristiq 50mg_ Wellbutrin XL 300mg_ & Abilify 15mg.  This combination is helping me to feel like normal again.  Pristiq is as good or better than Effexor XR with fewer side effects.  If you're just starting_ give it a chance.  It's worth it.,M,49,1  years,10/10/2009,Pristiq
418, 4, depression_ anxiety,none_ except for significant sexual side effects:  difficulty getting / maintaining erection_ major loss of sensitivity in penis.  Other than that_ I tolerated Pristiq very well.,Over the past 15 years_ I've tried many_ many different meds_ e.g. Zoloft_ Prozac_ Effexor_ Wellbutrin_ and others in combination with them (anafranil_ geodon_ buspar).  NOTHING has worked as well as my current combo of Wellbutrin XL (300 mg) and Pristiq (100mg) for both my mood and my anxiety.  But the sexual side effects are awful.  Cialis can counteract the erectile issues but when you're with a woman and you're literally not feeling anything (or very little)_ it's infuriating and frustrating.  I'm dropping the Pristiq for now because I don't think I can maintain a relationship without a sexual connection.  But the Pristiq was so effective for me I'd say it's really worth trying_ because it does appear that the incidence of sexual side effects does vary.  Oh_ and BTW_ I was on Wellbutrin alone without sexual side effects for quite a while before adding Pristiq to the mix a year ago.,M,41,1  years,10/10/2009Email,Pristiq
419, 3, Occational Depression/Anxiety,Decreased sex drive_ hair changes_ irratability_ short term memory problems_ anxiety still_ and ACNE...,Overall ok_ but the side effects are very frustrating.  I know it sounds strange_ but I have naturally curly hair and I have lost over 75% of my hair structure.  Sounds minimal to depression_ but frustrating every morning.  Also_ even though I am a mother of a 4 and 3 year old_ I have a harder time focasing and remembering things.  I feel not like myself anymore.

421, 5, Depression,No side effects other than immediate relief.,"My physician initially prescribed Celexa which provided limited relief.  After a ""meltdown""_ he then prescribed Efflexor which was like a prescription to a ""black hole"".  I now believe that hell exists on earth because this is what happened to me while taking Efflexor.  After just 1 day of taking Pristiq_ I actually began to feel like a human again.  I've been taking Pristiq for 3 weeks now and it is truly amazing - I had forgotten what it was like to feel anything close to normal.  Thank you Pristiq_ for saving me.",F,54,3  weeks,9/30/2009,Pristiq

I was nearly out of my mind with anxiety and depression with Cymbalta_ and also felt like I had a bad flu for four months with it....not good!! I can honestly say that I feel almost comletely restored to my former vibrant self with Pristiq. It's just amazing how some medications work wonders for some and do nothing for others. Cymbalta was my ""drug from hell"" and Pristiq is ""from heaven"". The depth of my gratitude that this drug is avaialble to those who know the excruciating suffering of these terrible illnesses... thank you Pristiq. I will report back if there are any changes! For those of you who haven't found the right med yet_ keep trying_ and try to persevere through the side effects for at least a month before you give up. My headaches_ diarrhea_ mood swings ALL GONE. No sexual side effects at all_ in fact_ my libido is great!

424, 2, Major Depression_ Anxiety_ OCD,In the beginning I had urinary discomfort and severe constipation. Then it threw me into an aggressive mania like a demon possessed me or something. This mania made me very angry and impulsive which is the complete opposite of my true nature. Sadly enough_ I even became physically aggressive to my husband (he is a true trooper!). Once that subsided_ I was just left feeling anxious and on the edge with a positive side of increased assertiveness (something I've been working on for years). I guess the good part is that I'm more empowered to stick up for myself and the depression isn't as severe. I also have bizarre dreams and wake up feeling totally exhausted. My libido has almost been lost completely with  difficulty reaching orgasm. One last thing_ if I forget to take the Pristiq_ I go into a crazy mood swing. Now that I've written that all out I'm left wondering why I'm still on this pill?,Don't know if this is the right medication but too scared to try yet another!! Been on at least 7 psych meds so far. Getting kinda discouraged....sorry if I'm passing it on....,F,24,5  months,9/21/2009,Pristiq
425, 5, Depression/Nerve pain/Mood Lability,None,"I have taken almost every antidepressant over the last twenty five years as I suffer from reaccurring bouts of moderate to severe depression. This drug has given me the fewest side effects. I am surprised by the lack of sexual side effects that seem to be the norm for these drugs and am very pleased about that! I did notice quite a big ""bump"" into a much more happy upswing!! If you are bipolar and not on a mood stabilizer_ be careful_ as always_ if taking an antidepressant_you do not get manic when taking this. I think it is an awesome medication for me. As the summer turns to fall it is a trigger for me to have a downswing_ so I am really hoping the Pristiq can help me hang on to the non depressed months I have so enjoyed and keep them going :). Remember you can't tell whether a drug works in a day or two-sometimes when I read these reviews I wonder what is up w/ that?

Last was Wellbutrin SR which worked well for a few years_ then suddenly my depression returned with a vengence.  I tried to ""get over it"" but my Dr finally decided to switch me to Prestiq (Also the ads on TV seemed to describe me to a T) I agreed. 5 weeks later I frankly don't give a damn about anything_ nothing bothers me_ which is great.  The ringing in my ears is very annoying. I have been on Weight Watchers for years and walk 3-5 miles a day.  I journal every morsel & drop that goes in my mouth_ yet in the last 3 weeks I have gained 5 lbs. I will give Pristiq a few more weeks_ but I have worked too hard to loose 75 lbs_ love my skinny self too much to continue with this drug.",F,50,5  weeks,9/13/2009Email,Pristiq

The first week I felt WONDERFUL. I had a surge of happiness_ my sex drive came back with a vengeance (which made my husband happy) and I was floating on air BUT now during this 3rd week I feel sad and get angry with things quickly. However I have not had a nocturnal panic attack and I sleep much better at night since stopping zoloft and taking prestiq. Maybe thats why I dont want to get out of bed in the morning. I am praying for the first week feelings to come back. I will give it another couple weeks and then call my doctor.,F,37,3  weeks,9/10/2009,Pristiq

It has taken a month to start working_ but it has been worth being patient and waiting for the medicine to kick in.  I have not had any major side effects and have not had a migraine in two weeks.  I was having them everyday.  I also have a history of depression_ and my mind is clearer.  My fibromyalgia pain is about 50% better_ and although I get mild headaches with Pristiq_ they are not migraines_ and I'd say my migraines are about 50% improved.  I plan to continue taking Pristiq_ and it has been better than any antidepressant I've ever taken_ and the side effects have been much fewer. I hope that this will be a drug other migraine sufferers will benefit from.,F,46,4.5  weeks,9/6/2009,Pristiq
431, 5, Depression_ anxiety_ PTSD_ DID_ BPD,Energy levels affected some.,Pristiq has been a huge blesing to me. I've been on most every drug including Effexor. Zoloft was probably the drug that has worked best for me until Pristiq. I have had essentialy zero side effects on Pristiq compared with other drugs. The only possible side effect I am noticing now is a lack of energy. The first two weeks I had an increase in energy. But the past two it has seemed to drop some. I wish I could try taking slightly less than 50 mg. to see if that would help with my energy level but the pills are not supposed to be altered in any way because they are time-released. As far as mood it has helped a great deal. I also feel more balanced and my anger and frustration have significantly lessened. Many of the other drugs have caused weight gain or an increase in appetite and cravings. Pristiq has not done so_ in fact I seem to be able to eat pretty much just out of true hunger and not out of emotional needs which is nice. I am very thankful for Pristiq and at least for me there has been a significant difference between Pristiq and Effexor. But one thing I am very aware of - everyone is different. What works for one person can be awful for another. You really have to find what works best for you and that is a process of trial and error. But I would say Pristiq is definitely worth a try.,F,50,5  weeks,9/4/2009,Pristiq
432, 4, Major depression,Within the first week: Fatigue_ night sweats_ nausea. Constant side effects: Delayed or impaired orgasm. Appetite slightly less.,Overall_ Pristiq has improved my depression but not to the point I'd like. Depressing thoughts are suppressed and anger is more easily controlled (things bother me less). DO NOT DRINK with this medication_ it will make you very sick_ cause vomiting and erratic behavior.,F,23,3  months,8/27/2009,Pristiq

Prozac worked the best for many years_ but just seemed to ""fizzle out"" at some point.  Then began the trial and error of a series of different drugs.  I would honestly give each drug a fair shake_ hoping that the side effects would diminish and the antidepressant qualities would kick in.  No such luck!  Some made me fat_ some made me sad_ mad_ manic_ sick_ sleepless_ etc....you get the idea.  Anyway_ the Pristiq seemed at first to work_ but after a few weeks and an increase in dosage I realized it wasn't helping.  The strangest thing about this drug for me was trying to figure out what time of day to take it... If I took in the am_ I felt zoned and tired all day; if taken at night_ I had trouble sleeping.  Go figure!  Anyway_ I gave it a ""3"" because it did seem to help at first_ but after awhile I just started to feel more depressed.  I'm off it and back to the Prozac again...for now.",F,45,3  months,8/19/2009Email,Pristiq

436, 2, Major depressive disorder,Persistent nausea,I am in Australia and consulted a marvellous institution called the Black Dog Institute who_ after taking a complete history and thorough analysis told me Pristiq was the answer for me because I had damaged my liver by taking TCAs for 4 years - they are the only thing that has worked so far_ except for Parnate which was a miracle but gave me terminal insomnia. The Pristiq is metabolized through the liver. The Black Dog Institute is govt funded so no reason to push Pristiq but it just didn't work. The only effect it had was constant nausea and tummy ache and perhaps an increase in depression - of a low level_ persistent kind_ rather than the screaming horrors_ if you know what I mean. Might work for others though.They now want me to try Ritalin 5mg and working up - on day 2 and will report.,F,53,3  months,8/8/2009,Pristiq

It's only been 11 days but the severe stinging and burning in my hands and feet are killing me. I'm used to the aches_ pains_ headaches that accompany depression and meds_ however_ I can't stand constantly applying lotion to my hands and feet hoping for some relief from the stinging sensation.

Pristiq is the only drug I have found to stop the tightness_ but with very little side effects. The nausia is the worst... Have noticed some hair loss (when I brush)and night sweats. Other than that_ I feel better than I have in several years. Feel like I'm ME again.... I recommend this.. but really_ it's all on how your own personal body accepts the med.

I do have decreased appetite but have not lost weight (which would actually be nice).  The nausea actually reminds me of the sick feeling I had when I was pregnant.  Yuck! It has helped my depression greatly_ so I have felt obligated to stick with it as long as I can tolerate it.

461, 4, anxiety,nausea in the beginning_ now only side effect is sweating ALOT when i sleep,i've been on almost every antidepressant out there and so far this one has worked the best for me. other than the terrible sweating at night there aren't any side effects for me. i am able to enjoy myself without constant fear of....well everything. the only problem is when i forget to take a pill i'm in BAD shape! withdraw happens the day of your first missed dose so i make sure to keep them with me all the time.,F,25,1  years,6/11/2009,Pristiq
462, 2, MDD_ PMDD,Extreme sedation when taking it in the morning_ insomnia when taking it at night. Felt zonked out most of the time. Near complete loss of libido. Blurred vision. Mild nausea and fluctuations in appetite. Heart palpitations. Constantly felt overheated_ like I had a fever.,I'm extremely sensitive to side effects from most of these medications. I did notice an improvement in my mood_ but the side effects did not go away with time on this drug. I was encouraged by the fact that I was able to take a full dose for almost three weeks_ though--I'm usually not able to stay on a quarter dose of anything more than a day or two! Also_ it really did reduce the symptoms of PMDD significantly. Too bad the side effects didn't go away.,F,46,18  days,6/7/2009Email,Pristiq

I had horrible headaches_ nausea_ cold sweats_ felt completely out of it and not myself and my hands were constantly tingling. I decided to give it a few more days before completely writing it off but the headaches didn't go away.  The jaw clenching started and was so bad I walked around holding my mouth. Nausea would come and go but would wake up very jittery.  Dr. took me off and am now trying Zoloft and doing a lot better after 3 days.,F,29,11  days,6/5/2009,Pristiq

No desire for food. my dream state and waking state seem to blend - I wake from dreams and not sure they happened or I dreamed them.,Was on 150mg of effexor. Now on 50mg of Pristiq for 3 weeks.  The sweating side effects on effexor are gone as are sexual side effects.  I've had a few instances where I get a fast heartbeat and then feel fainty/light headed. I get hungry physcially but no food really appeals to me.  I think that happened in the early days of Effexor too but it went away. Energy level seems same.

There were less side effects but I was sliding back into depression again. I had to add 10mg of Lexapro to start feeling better again. So I have stopped taking Pristiq several days ago and back to 15mg of Lexapro which does have side effects. But still better that feeling down.,M,57,6  weeks,5/30/2009,Pristiq

I went into it with apprehension to begin with. For the first couple of weeks I was miserable_ but I was miserable anyway.Stick with this_ Medications have changed since the last time I was on them. It does work_ and the side effects do get better.It will make sleeping a little more difficult. I still take ambien to sleep_ however I had sleeping problems before the meds. 50mg was a rolercoaster ride daily_ so I switched to 100mg_ For the most part the switch from 50mg to 100mg was mild.All in all_ a rough ride at first_ but worth the wait when it started working for me.

After being on 50mg for three weeks and realising that it was not benefiting me_ I increased the dose to 100mg. I've now been on 100mg for 10 days and have noticed no benefit.

Plan says to augment with Welbutrin which is only available cheaply here for smokers(!) if I need ""more grunt"". Sor far - felt like taking aspirin on 50mg so went up to 100mg and feel ok but sleep a lot. Not working at the moment so that is ok. Appetite decreased - thank goodness. Also on Lamictal.

It really took the edge off and put me on a more even keel. But that only lasted a few weeks I suppose I got used to the dose and the positive effects just dissipated and I started to gain weight -even though I work out 6 days a week. I really don't understand why these medications make you gain weight. At the end of the day the weight gain really adds to my low self esteem,F,51,2  months,4/21/2009,Pristiq

Extreme difficulty in concentration and by third week_ a VERY strong feeling of dysphoria and lack of motivation_ none of which i EVER had before in my life.,Very original. An antidepressant that made me depressed when formerly I had never been depressed. A supposedly effective cure for ADHD according to my doctor who should really retire by now because he's starting to forget his name...which made me have ADHD times 10.

I had bloating_ cramping guts_ achey bones_ foggy brain_ dizziness_ burning sensation on tongue and hands_ breathlessness and fast heartbeat in bed at night_ and a red face at bedtime_ even though I had not been out in the sun. I am not sure if the side effects are remnants of the initial depression or part of the Pristiq effect. My gastroenterologist is also looking into an underlying gut problem and suspects malabsorbtion_ which may have started the depression. I really hope 50mg works for me. I just had a spasm of sleepiness just then  !!

487, 5, Severe depression & anxiety,During first few weeks_ and with insufficient dosage (50 mg)_ same odd flashes as on Effexor XR when dose is overdue.  After that_ very few effects attributable to the med.,With sufficient dosage (100 mg) and sufficient time to acclimate_ Pristiq is as good as Effexor XR ever was_ but has very little in the way of tangible side effects.  I am very even-tempered_ but do not feel numbed-out emotionally or physically.  Energy level is pretty good_ mind reasonably clear for a guy entering early geezerhood.I was on the minimum dose for Effexor XR_ so my Dr. initially put me on 50 mg Pristiq.  This did not work.  Upon reporting this to her_ she put me on 100 mg Pristiq. First 10 days were NOT a lot of fun_ then everything smoothed out.A word regarding soem of the previous responses here:  You cannot judge ANYTHING about an SSRI or SNRI in a few days.  Unless your are experiencing extreme anguish that is different from how you previously felt_ or you have some kind of new life-threatening physical symptoms_ give the drug a chance!  It really does take quite a few weeks before your brain chemistry settles into a new stable pattern.  I know very well that patience in the face of severe depression is very difficult_ but please try to muster it up_ and give timely and accurate feedback to your doctor.,M,66,3  months,3/25/2009,Pristiq

For the first few weeks_ I stopped my daily ritual of sobbing multiple times a day for no apparent reason. The tears have returned. I still suffer from fatigue_ even after supplementing my AD with a prescription-only derivative of folic acid (which is said to boost neurotransmitter levels). I am suicidal_ but I attribute that to my hopelessness and not the AD. I am now bumping up to 100 mg daily. I am just praying that I don't experience any side effects...

494, 5, severe depression,Nothing major.  Perhaps a bit of tiredness that's probably more attributable to the depression.,This drug has been wonderful for me -- especially after I went from 50 mg to 100 mg.  I have taken Zoloft in years past and have noticed side effects like dry mouth.  Zoloft was OK but seemed to fail me when I sunk into a major depression a year ago.  For me_ an SNRI seems to work better than an SSRI.  I think it's VERY important for readers of these reviews to remember two things: 1) Everyone's body chemistry and needs are different and there is no magic bullet.  Be patient with the drugs and wih yourself as you find the best treatment for you_ and 2) Don't mistake exhaustion_ loss of sex drive_ or other physical symptoms for side effects of the drugs when in fact they have proven ties to the physical symptoms of depression.  Be cautious not to confuse the two_ which might lead you to dismiss a drug before you've given it half a chance.  Seriously folks -- two days on an anti-depressant will do NADA for you.  Two weeks is more like it.,F,38,10  months,3/1/2009,Pristiq

I had to stop taking it because it did not really give me the full sustained beneficial effect I had with effexor xr.  It seemed it quite did not help me get out of my depression and was not doing much for my anxiety.  So I went back to Effexor xr and I can see how different I feel now on Effexor_ I am more optimistic_ positive and focused_ my anxiety is back to normal levels.  I do feel the decrease libido side effect but prefer to learn to deal with it than living with depression and anxiety.  One good thing about Pristig is that it had very minimal sexual side effects and not weight gain.

Then_ I understood I should return to Pristiq and I am on it now for 5 months and doing great. I did have to increase the dosage to 100mg. I'm strugling tho with very strong constipation problems.Besides the hotflashes I had several pain symptons. Neck_ shoulders_ low back_ waist_ ankles... Pristiq put them away as well. I had no depression or anxiety and I keep not having.Although my hotflashes make me miserable (Pristiq did reduce them to 3 to 4 a day and turn them very mild)_ I am not sure if I can keep on this drug. I have no insurance and to get a 3 month dose costs me $350. This is a new drug and there is no generic for it. I heard that Maca (a supplement)helps with hotflashes besides being an aphrodisiac_ or at least an energiser.

When I cut back to 50mg_ the side effects dissipated but the drug seemed to have no readily identifiable effect upon my depression or anxiety.,For me_ it simply didn't work. It may have contributed to weight gain but then I was also taking Lyrica at the same time_ which is known for weight gain. I additionally take Oxycodone & Lyrica for chronic spinal pain/degeneration and they cause depression & anxiety that I was hoping the Pristiq would combat in conjunction with Klonopin & Ritalin.

504, 4, Dysthymia,Wellbutrin XL stopped working for me after 6 years. Pristiq was the third med my doc had me try_ after Celexa and Cymbalta failed me.  I took 50 mg Pristiq first thing in the morning.  I really needed it to wake up and was pretty groggy until it kicked in about 30 minutes after taking it. I had some nausea for the first few days.  I also had mouth dryness_ but not as severe as on Cymbalta.  My doc warned me Pristiq could make my blood pressure go up.  I had my blood pressure checked at my GI docs office after a week on Pristiq_ and it was my normal 120s over 70s.  A week later (2 weeks on Pristiq)_ I had my BP checked again and it was mid-140s over mid 90ssignificantly higher than normal.  About a week later (3 weeks on Pristiq)_ my BP at my gyns office was 130s over mid-80s.  Since my dysthymia wasnt fully controlled on 50 mg daily_ my psychiatrist would have raised my dose to 100 mg dailybut she was concerned about the in,My dysthymia manifests as apathy_ cynicism_ lack of motivation_ head-to-toe body_ joint and muscle aches_ dyspepsia/IBS_ overeating_ physical and mental fatigue_ word retrieval difficulty_ 'brain fog'_ insomnia_ and a generally unsociable_ 'bah humbug/grumpy old hag' attitude.   50 mg Pristiq did nothing for my aches and pains_ but it really helped my mood_ energy level_ motivation and attitude.  I was much more sociable_ outgoing and willing to converse on Pristiq.  I took more pride in my appearance; I even went shopping for clothes and experimented with different hairstyles and makeup techniques.  I was more productive at work and didnt suffer from my usual midday or mid-evening slumps.  I felt happy and optimistic.  I noticed no sexual side effects and no significant interaction with alcohol.  At the end of the day_ I felt genuinely tired and ready for bed.  I slept better on Pristiq with fewer awakenings.

506, 5, severe depression,loss of libido,I have been taking this medicine for 3 months.  I have been doing very well on it.  I take 50 mg on the onset of my menstruation and then take 100 mg after I ovulate (2 weeks 50mg_ 2 weeks 100mg).  I was taking Effexor XR for 5 years.  I started with 37.5mg and eventually ended up at 300mg.  I was having a lot of problems taking such a high dose (memory loss_ loss of libido_ skin lesions_ weight gain).  I was on Effexor for such a long period of time because I was a bit out of it and didn't realize that my health problems were due to such a high dose.  I went off Effexor (process of about 6 months) and was clean from the drug for 2 months.  I realized my depression problem was the result of the onset of the second part of my cycle (after ovulation).

512, 5, Post-partum depression,When I forget to take it_ the effects of crying and depression come on very strongly_ very quickly.,I suffered from terrible postpartum depression with my first child and no medication saved me from it. I even had to go to the mental institution and be numbed by all the narcotic drugs they pumped into me. Nothing helped. After my second child_ I asked the doctor to put me on something right away. He gave me Pristiq and I have never been happier. I now have the ability to go about my day without breaking down into tears every hour. I can read books to my kids without breaking down into a psychotic episode. I even have the ability to be emotional support for my husband instead of the other way around. I love this drug because it allows me to be me.,F,25,1  months,11/30/2008,Pristiq
513, 2, hot flashes,slight nausea the first week_ maybe one or two days but as I read from another - genital anesthesia describes it.  I'm taking this because it's not supposed to have sexual side effect but it does on me!,Going thru surgical menopause_ and the hot flashes were driving me crazy.  I'm taking Wellbutrin XL (nightmare in itself the first two weeks) in addition to the Pristiq and it actually did work on the hot flashes - the first one that has!  I tried Wellbutrin alone_ that didn't work_ then with Lexapro that didn't really work and I had sexual side effects_ so now Wellbutrin and Pristiq.  I don't think I'll trade sex for no hot flashes.  Guess I'll go back to sweating!!,F,49,2  weeks,11/27/2008,Pristiq
514, 3, Depression,"Yawning constantly.  Always felt as if I had a very dry ""lump"" in my throat.","I have a high-stress life parenting two very special needs children.

But as a singer_ I could not tolerate the dry_ lump in the throat feeling.",F,39,3  weeks,11/19/2008Email,Pristiq
515, 4, Depression_ Cyclothymia,"Headache_ ""edgy feeling""_ numbness",I have tried them all_ except Lithium.  I have seen a dramatic difference in ME. I felt better after 2 days!  Still have headache_ no nausea_ do have a decreased appetite.  I am happier_ calmer_ sleep better_ (though I still us Ambien every night).  My husband has noticed a dramatic difference in my mood and disposition.  So far so good.  I am hopeful_ but like everyone I hate taking any drugs to function_ again I must remember the Brain is an organ just like the kidney_ pancreas_ etc. and sometimes it too is diseased.  So there are those of us who need medication for our brains....for life.  I also take 2 mg. Xanax_ 200 mg. Tramadol and 10 mg. Ambien nightly.  I think it is always helpful to include all meds taken on these boards.  Remember we only have this moment.  Just be.,F,54,2  weeks,11/18/2008,Pristiq

518, 5, depression_ anxiety,First two weeks-yawning_sleepiness_ slight spaced out feeling_insommnia. All side effects disappeared after two weeks. Absolutely NO sexual side effects or increased appetite!,Great med. Very mild side effects. It seemed to go in and out of effectiveness for the first month_ but once it kicked in- awesome. Not sedating at all_ maybe even a little activating without being jittery. Don't get discouraged in the first 6-8 weeks if you feel it's not working_ this med definilty needs time to kick in and stabilize. Highly recommend!,F,34,8  weeks,11/10/2008,Pristiq
519, 3, depression_ binge eating,excessive yawning but not sleepy_ clinching jaw_ slight teeth grinding but not noticeable. small bouts of energy on and off throughout the day,took 2bc powders for headache on 2nd day and appetite returned. i guess the bc powders overturned the pristiq. but day 1 and 3 little to no appetite. not sure if i'm hungry or not. can not finish a complete meal. over half the meal still left over. once took welbutrin for depression_ didn't work at all. mother passed away unexpectantly 7 months ago and having a hard time getting over. i read 8 chapters of psychology homework in 1 day_ was never able to do this. unable to orgasm.,F,30,4  days,11/3/2008,Pristiq

522, 4, Depression,None.  I had severe sexual side effects with Effexor (loss of libido_ genital anesthesia) and no problems with Pristiq.,Pristiq had similar effects to Effexor for me.  Effexor had a little more of a feel-good quality_ Pristiq is a little more activating.  I couldn't put up with the sexual side effects of Effexor_ though_ which are gone with Pristiq.,M,51,3  weeks,10/30/2008,Pristiq

529, 5, Anxiety and Depression,The first day I was a little tired_ yawned a lot. I felt the medicine kick in within 24 hours and was amazed at how good I felt.  It very much reminds me of Effexor in the quick action and few side effects.  The first week I got tingling in my toes off and on and a small headache. Then I just felt so great it was amazing. I've started to go to the next level at 100 mg and similar side effects started but are going away.  No sexual side effects at all.  I don't tolerate any of these very well and this was the last chance I really had to take something...and I needed it! Highly recommend it.,Everyone seems to have different reactions to these medications and I've heard Effexor and Pristiq are similar and the only two that act on serotonin and norepinephrine to alleviate anxiety as well as depression.  I have migraines_ so these can be hard to take without getting migraines.  I'm thrilled to find something that works.,F,46,1  months,9/23/2008,Pristiq
530, 2, depression,foggy head_ tired_ nausea_ sexual dysfunction_ irratibility,I've tried a variety of SSRI type drugs over the course of several years and this is just like any other - puts your mind in an unatural and sometimes uncomfortable state.  The first couple of days I felt the typical placebo effect of potentially getting some help from this drug but then the foggy headed feeling ensued and stayed with accompanying occasional irritation.  I had to use ambien to sleep because of the upset stomach and other side effects which also leads to lack of good REM or deep sleep.  Sure you can stay on this drug and get accustomed to the side effects but the greyed-out effect and lack of ability to concentrate is not worth it.,M,52,14  days,9/18/2008,Pristiq

533, 2, Depression & Anxiety,Anger_ Anxiety_ Hair Loss,My Doctor gave me this_ saying that it was like Effexor. This medication did not feel like Effexor.

536, 4, anxiety/depression,nausia the first day_ the next day was pretty hyper. yawning constantly since then,Only two weeks on it so far so can't say much. The side effects are not bad and actually paxil was ALOT worse side effects for me. So far I've seen a small improvement compared to paxil once again where I took for 8 month with no improvement whatsoever. I feel less overwhelmed all the time and less fears about something bad going to happen. So far so good_ we will see.,F,24,2  weeks,8/23/2008,Pristiq
537, 5, Anti-Depressant,"Mainly sexual but the wife and I are working through it.  Began to see small results the first day.  After the 3rd day I felt like my old self.  I am happier than I ever have been and has actually helped to calm my ADD.  The other item I notice is that I am now a little more ""hotter-natured"" than I was previously_ but do not have any sweating.  I just keep the office cool.",I have heard of others that have had a hard time going through the initial month_ but after that I've heard nothing but good things.  I really feel the best that I have in my whole life.  My negativity is gone and I now see positives in everything.  My Dr. advised me that it could take as long as two months before everything is regulated.  Thankfully_ it didn't take that long for me.,M,41,2  months,8/11/2008,Pristiq
