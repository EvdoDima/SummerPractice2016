0, 5, Surgical Menopause at 35,It's been 20+ years so I'm not certain although I've wondered about weight gain,I love my Ogen!  I've been on it for over 20 years now and hate to think about getting off it.  I experienced major depression after my hysterectomy and terrible hot flashes.  I was allergic to Premarin and other estrogens.  I feel lucky to have found ogen_ and think that it has helped my skin remain supple_ etc.,F,56,20  years,8/31/2009,Ogen .625
1, 5, HRT,NONE,Sticks with you -  unlike estrace. Can take it once a day with no hot flashes.  When I tried taking estrace I had to take it twice as often at twice the dose and it still didn't work as well as Ogen. I use the generic by Watson FYI.,M,40,10  years,3/12/2009,Ogen .625
