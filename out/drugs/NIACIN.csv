1, 5, Low HDL_ Moderate Total Cholesterol,Over the past 15 years_ I have tried Ruger immediate release_ Endurance Products short release_ Trader Joe's timed release (TR)and Endurance Products Endur-acin TR_ usually with one or two 325 mg aspirin about 30 minutes before taking 500 mg or 1000 mg of niacin in the morning with breakfast and some ibuprofin plus 500 mg niacin at bedtime.  With immediate release_ I get some flushing about half the time.  The short release gives some flushing about 10% of the time.  Endur-acin is best with no flushing at any time_ and I use it now exclusively.  TJ's is variable from lot to lot_ some lots with more flushing than others.,Niacin reduced my total cholesterol from about 210 to 160 and raised HDL from about 33 to 45.  Five years ago I added a low dose_ 20 mg_ of lovastatin (now 10 mg of simvastatin) that reduced TC more_ to about 140_ and some fish oil that raised HDL to about 52.  I'm pleased with a low-cost regimen that has such good results with no adverse side effects.,M,68,15  years,11/14/2009Email,Niacin

3, 4, Raise HDL,For the first 3 months_ 500mg didnt cause flushing.  Then I was flushing about once a week.  That was unexpected very uncomfortable.  Since then I have lowered it to 250mg,My HDL doesnt seem to have improved noticeably.  However_ my blood pressure has lowered significantly.  So Ive lowered my Toprol XL dosage and stayed with Niacin.,M,43,90  days,5/27/2009,Niacin

5, 5, Low HDL and familiy history,Family history of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular disease in all male members of family_ and all with significant CV events by age 48. My TC was 200_ but HDL was low 30s. The first two weeks of (immediate release) Niaicn at 250mg were unforgettable. Intense flushing over 97% of my body accompanied with intense itching_ even with aspirin (helped a little). After a while_ started taking Endurance Products_ EP Plain Naicn_ (1 g/dose) which seems to act like a delayed-release formulation_ three times a day. After a while_ had elevated liver enzymes_ discontinued for a month_ and started by with twice a day dosing (total 3 g daily). After 4 years_ I'm still on twice a day dosage (2 g twice a day) and my HDL measures anywhere from 40 to 50_ LDL <80_ Triglycerides <50_ TC <140 and normal liver enzymes. Now taking Carlson labs immediate release 500 mg tablets (from Vitaminshoppe.com) which costs around 20 cents per dose (nickel per 500mg tablet). Liver enzymes are fine. Have also l,I still flush slightly and I'm very fair-skinned. The flushing subsides in 10 minutes and the itching is very minimal. I love what it's done for me and I'm glad I stuck with it. In the beginning_ taking a baby aspirin 30 minutes before the daytime dose helped with the flushing and itching.,M,50,4  years,1/30/2008Email,Niacin
6, 2, Help with High Cholesterol.,Running to the rest room to urine 5-6 times a night was very bothersome.  Could not sleep without constantly having to go to rest room.  Fish oil worked much better with cholesterol medicine.,,F,52,3  months,10/26/2007,Niacin
