0, 4, Severe sinus congestion from cold,Wakefulness_nervousness_ decreased appetite_ need to urinate more often.,I have a stash of this from when it was easily obtainable.I only use when I have a severe cold. It dries my sinuses and helps me get through the workday. This might sound odd_ but I'd like to know if other men have had the following side effect: When I have taken it_ and I have a bowel movement I sometimes ejaculate a pretty fair amount of semen as I push. No orgasm_ just a flow of semen. Anyone else experience this? Thanks,M,59,1  times 1X AN,2/3/2012Email,Pseudoephedrine hcl
1, 4, allergies_ post-nasal drip,none,"This is the form they carried at the pharmacy after the old ""Sudafed Sinus and Allergy"" disappeared from the shelves.  I really needed the extra antihistamine that the allergy version had_ and switching to regular old Sudafed was a challenge.  Nonetheless_ I managed on this version of Sudafed for a few years before deciding to go cold-turkey.  After reading some things that warn about using Sudafed long-term_ I've switched to chlorpheniramine maleate (the trusty antihistamine from the old Sudafed).",F,25,10  years,1/12/2010,Pseudoephedrine hcl
2, 4, Nasal congestion_ allergies,I take the a 12 hour pill in the morning.  I can not sleep if I take a 24hr pill.  It really help me deal with sinus pressure.,"This works for me.  I have bad reaction to all the antihistamines I have tried to date(I have tried them all). When the pollens are bad I will take Benadryl 4 hour tab to reduce the pressure and plan a nap.  This is what works best for me.  I have tried new products_ I still get bad side effects.  The name of the commercial product I use is call ""ENTEX LA""(Canada)  my Dr. gave it to me 30 years ago and I still use it as needed.",F,51,30  years,9/1/2008,Pseudoephedrine hcl
