0, 4, RA,None noticed_ possible fatigue_ headaches,Have been using for about a year and a half. One 17.5 mg injection weekly. Helps with joint pain_ but does not completely make me pain free. Need steroids or another RA medicine in addition. Does not prevent flare-ups but DOES prevent inflammation which leads to deterioration of the joints and deformity which is the greatest thing about this drug and why is extremely important.,F,24,1.5  years17.5 mg 1X W,6/30/2010Email,Methotrexate preservative free
