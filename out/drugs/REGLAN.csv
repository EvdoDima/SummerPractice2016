2, 1, Migraine,Treated at hospital for migraine.  The cocktail of drugs included reglan and caused anxiousness to point I had to walk around in hospital room.  This just compounded the migraine since I was unable to relax.  This is the second time it's happened to me.  I have had multiple treatments for migraines to include reglan but seems I'm now developing a reaction to the drug.  I will not be taking it anymore.,,F,45,1  days 1X D,7/23/2016,Reglan

5, 1, C-Diff,It has been decades since I was placed on Reglan.  I started having involuntary jerking of my hands and jaw movements.  I had suffered depression before but never like this depression.  My pulmonary doctor told me reglan could cause the jerking and after I stopped it_ it did cease.  The depression however held on for over three months.  I hope those who are experiencing this depression will take hope that it will not last forever and if they can endure it without other psychotic medications to hang in there.  I found benadryl at night helped.  One day I woke up and I was ME again.  However_ years later I will have short episodes of depression hit.  I have learned to recognize it and just breath and wait for it to pass.  In times of stress_ my jerks come back_ too. If you are depressed from this talk to those around you to make certain you don't harm yourself.  Knowing what I know today_ I would have tried using L-Tyrosine.,I would urge those who have negative effects report it.,F,67,2  months20mg,6/13/2016Email,Reglan
6, 1, Nausea in hospital,Severe anxiety/panic/terror_ severe depression_ delirium_ muscle spasms_ twitching muscles_ sore arms/legs/!back and shoulders_ weakness_ jaw clenching_ toes twitching_ hysterical crying_ inability to concentrate_ fear_ inability of being alone_ disassociation from my child_ insomnia and inability to stay asleep etc,Do not take this medication. I went to the ER for nausea and the dr gave me this via IV. I reacted to the first dose and they ignored me and gave me 2 more- too close together and I went into a delirium. Following that was severe gut wrenching depression and anxiety- both of which I never had before! That was 2 months ago and I have been suffering ever since. I have symptoms going on. I'm unsure of how long this is going to take but I am trying to fight for my life- as crazy as that sounds- this drug will destroy a perfectly normal life and person. I have never had mental issues before and I have had to see a psych. They prescribe meds but I won't take any. I am trying to heal on my own. However the physical stuff scares me- I am praying to God my exposure does not cause Tardive Dyskenisia. I notice I clench my jaw a lot and my neck/mouth hurts. I feel like Im holding my tongue weird and it's freaking me out. I'm seeing a neurologist soon to try and find answers. This has been a complete nightmare and I can't believe I've gone through this from a medication. I wouldn't believe it was true if it didn't happen to me- a perfectly normal functioning person turned into a basket case. This drug will put you through immense torture both mentally and physically. Please do your research and do not take this medication. I regret that day more than anything!!!!!,F,32,1  days30 mg,6/8/2016Email,Reglan

23, 1, Gastroparesis,Severe depression and and anxiety leading to mental breakdown,"My mother was prescribed this medication and soon after discontinuing med she started with depression_ anxiety_ nervousness_ insomnia_ anorexia_ and confusion. This medication took an active senior citizen who traveled_ had a circle of friends to socialize with_ maintained her single home on her own_ drove her own car and appeared 10 years younger than her age to a depressed_ suicidal_ crazy women. Weeks after stopping the medication along with the side effects she appeared to have aged 10 years older then what she was. Since she always looked 10 years younger_ this was such a significant change. She had to move in with family_ give up her house_ could not drive anymore_ refused to even talk with famy or friends on the phone_ constantly worried_ complained she felt as though she were ""jumping out of her skin""_ could not eat_ and had suicidal ideations. Despite therapist_ doctors_ antidepressants and anti anxiety meds_ my mother gave up her battle and refused water and food and a living will stated she desired no hydration_ medical intervention_ or tube feedings. She was lucid enough to re enforce her wishes. I believe this medication led to a complete mental breakdown as to which she was not returning from.

The doctor did not tell me of any side effects_ yet at my age I am at higher risk of experiencing them. My grades slipped at uni and I stopped taking it after 6 tablets_ I saw another doctor who thought the idea to prescribe this to me was wrong_ but it was too late then. It took about a week for the anxiety and other side effects to disappear_ I wish I never took it.

63, 1, Gastroparesis,,For several months I've had a ache in my chest_ gurgles in my throat and a slight sick feeling when eating. The doctor's diagnosis of a gastric motility problem made sense. He prescribed Metoclopramide (aka Reglan). I was feeling a bit depressed prior to taking them. After the first two pills (the first day) I was feeling a bit delirious. By the evening I was wishing I could just quietly die. After day two (another 2 pills) I was suffering severe mental anguish and feeling very tearful; I couldn't face going to work. I don't take any medicine normally_ even painkillers_ don't smoke or use recreational drugs. I drank a small amount of wine (100-200ml) both days_ 4 or 5 hours after taking the pills (which I read may amplify side effects_ so may be a bad plan). I didn't feel any benefits at all (interestingly_ I got hiccoughs for ten minutes at lunch during day 2 - I used to get hiccoughs whenever I ate a big meal when this whole problem started)_ but I probably didn't give the pills a long enough time to work_ though they seem to have worked on my brain!3 days after stopping I'm back to the mild depression I had before taking the pills.

Was told it was Motilium (maybe it was) but  at any rate the prescription I was sent home with wasn't Motilium but Metoclopramide. Both increase milk production_ etc. Shortly after returning home a midwife friend of mine told me not to take it because it was an antipsychotic and to try some natural things instead_ etc so I did but still took some off and on (mostly because I'm terrible at remembering to take pills) for next month or so. |I had pretty bad baby blues for about a month and now wonder if it wasn't somehow related to taking this stupid drug. Long story short I recently started taking it again but more consistently for like 10 days or so to see if I can boost my supply and keep going with some breast feeding. About 5 days into it I started having intense feelings of sadness that kind of washed over me_ would come in waves and very sad thoughts of how time is moving too fast etc. Fearing my baby growing up too fast_ Sadness over not being with her etc. Just irrational sadness and nothing I did seemed to be able to lift me out of it.I will be doing something very benign and all of a sudden there it is_ intense sadness and crying spells.

I COMPLETELY unable to see a light at the end of the tunnel.  I was lost in grief for my ""old life"".   I resented my child.",I struggled with low supply. Lactation consultant suggested I take Reglan. my OB wrote Rx for it.  LC told me that depression was reported as a small side effect but if I had no history of depression (which I didn't) I shouldn't be worried.  WOW.   I took this pill for 30 days. 1 pill every 6 hours.  I kept a daily diary at the time and you can see how my mood got lower and lower and lower.  As if it wasn't bad enough to struggle as a new mom_ have trouble breastfeeding_ and THEN get dumped into a huge depression?   I ran out of pills after my 30 day supply and by that time had decided to quit breastfeeding.  I didn't wean off (wasn't told to).  Well_ 2 days after stopping I hit a brick wall.  I couldn't stop crying all day.  Could barely take care of my baby. UGH.  Went to my OB. She said she doubtd it was the Reglan b/c she prescribes it a lot.  Hmph.   I was put on a low dose of Zoloft bc she figured it was PPD (which it might have been combined with the extra boost of depression from Reglan).   Glad to say 7 months later I LOVE MY BABY and I LOVE my life.  Zoloft was great_ it worked like a miracle.  I'm starting the weaning process of Zoloft now. I hope it goes well.  Reglan is POISON.

This will probably go down as the worst experience in my entire life. It's been 21 days since_ and I still struggle every single day. And of course_ the doctors at the hospital were too careless to warn me about the possible side effects. Being a person that is very sensitive to any medication_ only from this one time_ was I thrown into Reglan hell. I think it is a toxic medication that should be put to rest_ once and for all_ considering the side effects completely outweigh the intended 'positive' effects. It has ruined my entire summer_ and sometimes I fear it will ruin my entire life_ considering healing from the trauma has been a very slow and draining process.

70, 1, Slow Motility,PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!! Reglan or Metoclopramide was originally utilized as an ANTIPSYCHOTIC and when the medical community realized its side effect profile i.e. ability to speed motility_ it was quickly marketed/patented as a GERD med or tool for those suffering from gastroparesis--which is why my wife took it. This drug was tested on rats years ago_ and the side effects these animals endured are equally horrifying when you read the literature. After 6 months she withdrew from the medication and suffered horrifying side effects including depression_ anxiety_ psychosis induced by insomnia_ loss of memory_ and too many other cognitive detriments to list. It took her several months to recover and this was only after a visit to a psychiatric unit!!!  My wife is a brilliant professional_ and is still suffering the effects of this horrible drug.

I've never really read the side effects of medications before because I've never had any real issues with taking anything. I feel so naive now!!! I've NEVER had depression or anxiety before. The first thing I noticed was being so so tired but I brushed it off to being a working mother of three. Then came the random bouts of depression_ it would last about 20 minutes or so then go away. Then last Monday happened. It was the worst day of my life. I couldn't stop crying_ I wanted to quit my job_ push a rock over my front door and never come out of my house again. This was NOT me_ I knew something was wrong. The last few weeks I've been battling horrible thoughts and feelings that make me physically ill. My dear friend said she looked into taking Reglan for her milk supply but didn't because of the side effects. Thats when the lightbulb went off and I researched what I had been taking. I was dumbfounded by the results I found. I should have looked BEFORE I took this horrible drug.

Instead of Reglan for seasickness_ I would recommend just eating a green apple or some ginger before you get on a ship. This helps and there aren't any long lasting side effects.,I took a total of 40 mg of Reglan. This past year was very challenging for me. I spent the first 4-5 months of recovery talking myself out of a suicidal depression and anxiety attacks/fear. The one thing that kept me fighting was my sense of perseverance and hope...that one day things would get better_ and they did. Although it's been about a year since I took Reglan_ I still have some side effects_ but 98% of them are gone. The mental dullness lingers_ but I barely twitch. When I twitch_ it's very_ very small. All of the other side effects are gone. I'm sure to say that by this summer_ things will have healed completely. I measured my recovery not in hours or days_ but in weeks and months. I've been to several neurologists and one of them suggested that there might be a genetic predisposition/intolerance to metoclopramide_ the chemical that's in Reglan. This would explain my temporary condition. When you hurt the brain_ it takes a long time to heal because of the blood-brain barrier. I'm posting this to help people. The doctors wanted me to take their medications. I told them no because I wanted my brain to heal naturally. Because I'm not a doctor_ I can't tell you what to do with your body. I can only tell you what I myself did to get through this mess: I took Omega-3_ E_ C_ and B complex vitamins. I ate bananas and salmon_ went to the gym often_ kept a journal_ avoided being alone_ went outside a lot.Hope this helps,F,26,4  days10mg 1X D,1/14/2014Email,Reglan

This drug is terribl_e and should not be used over a few days if at all_ yet one dose is not going to ""ruin your life"". That is called hypochondria.

Well_ as a result of the Reglan which she administered I had a full blown cardiac event in which I had tachycardia and i felt like I was dying. My heart rate went over 200 and I was clutching my heart and the back of my neck was on fire_ and I ultimately went unconscious. I had never experienced such an overwhelming sense of fear and dread in my life. I have no history of panic attacks or any allergies. But that experience traumatized me because I never fully understood what happened until I read the literature on Reglan. How this drug is available on the market is beyond me.

133, 1, gastroparesis,depression_ anxiety_ insomnia,My experience with reglan was two months_ but I hope this will be of help to someone going through reglan misery. I started taking reglan for gastoparesis in May of last year. By late July_ for the first time in my life_ I was experiencing severe anxiety and depression. I didn't connect it to the reglan (drs. were no help) until Sept. 1. Once I made the connection_ I was so distressed that I quit the reglan cold turkey on Sept. 1. (I'm not necessarily recommending this - I've heard you're supposed to taper off_ but I wanted it out of my system_ and I had a good support system around me - people who would constantly remind me it was the drug making me miserable.) Basically_ September and October were a sad and anxious blur for me. I started to feel better in early November_ and I kept feeling better as time went by. Now it's July again_ and I've been 100% recovered for some time. The gastroparesis of course came back_ and this may be really idiosyncratic to me_ but Veganmax protein shake by Lifetime Fitness gives me gp relief (I also take motilium and HCL)_ and_ unlike with reglan_ I'm not looking for a bridge to jump off of. My heart goes out to everyone currently devastated by reglan - my reglan depression was by far the scariest and worst thing that has ever happened to me - but the drug did leave my system_ and I made a full recovery. I also decided not to take anti-depressants during my recovery_ as I'd never needed them before. I don't know if that's the right answer,F,40,2  months40 2X D,7/8/2012,Reglan

I was having issues w/ keeping food down but no more than anyone who can keep food down w/ the flu. I took it as soon as I got home from the doc and it knocked me out completely for about 30 min after that all the jumping of the legs sat in_ twitching_ I even went to stand up twice and put my right leg down only to bust my butt. It was like I couldnt control my leg. I was taking a RX cough syrup and I thought the bad reaction was coming from that. Nope! After a few more days of taking the Reglan I figured out it was the problem. What makes me mad is why would a doc prescribe this mess for someone who does have the medicinal condition that have been menchioned on this thread? I'm hoping to get it out of my system though I haven't been able to find out how long that is? I took it for 2 days then stopped then took it again a wk later which was today realizing moments after I took it the cough syrup wasn't the problem so I only have 1 dose today in my system.

I felt like I could not go on_ could barely take care of my 3 children_ could not feel any joy_ felt like my soul had been taken away_ I was not myself_ and it was the worst feeling I have ever experienced in my life. Took 2-3 months to fully recover from withdrawal. If you believe you are experiencing Reglan withdrawal_ please have hope_ I DID GET BETTER and you can too_ it will take some time and there are medications that can help. Please see my comments for full explanation and contact me by email if you need support_ I contacted another patient from this site when I was suffering and it was incredibly helpful!,I was prescribed reglan through a lactation consultant to increase my breast milk supply_ my baby was 7 months old_ my milk supply returned almost immediately_ it was very effective. Was given a refill after 40 days without incident_ and then around 50-60 days I began to experience bouts of depression - they were inconsistent_ occuring every other day or two straight days followed by two or three normal days. The depression was uncomfortable  - I was fatigued and listless_ had trouble getting through the day.  Went from 10mg 3xday to 10mg 2xday to see if the side effects would lessen_ they didn't so I decided to discontinue the Reglan - no one had told me you MUST wean off this medication and within 24-48 hours I began to experience the most horrible psychiatric withdrawal symptoms.The withdrawal started about mid-day_ I felt racy_ anxious_ depressed_ couldn't figure out what was wrong_ by dinner time I was a wreck_ I had never felt this way my entire life. Then the withdrawal symptoms mysteriously dissappeared by bedtime.  This pattern continued each day and got worse so I sought medical help but was told there was no such thing as Reglan withdrawal.  I was finally treated with medication_ first Xanax_ then Klonopin_ and Zoloft and I'm here to say that it's taken over 3 months but I have finally recovered from the withdrawal and gotten off all medications. Please feel free to contact me for more details of my experience_ I really want to help others going through this.,F,35,60  days10mg 3X D,5/8/2012Email,Reglan

141, 1, vomiting and bloody emesis,My 19y/o daughter was prescribed this med for Nausea/bloody emesis. We cannot say that it helped because today_ after her 3rd dose_ she began to complain of jaw clenching and spasms in the jaw. By the time I got her home from a friend's_ she was nearly in a frenzy. I have given her 50 mg Benadryl per MD order_ and she has heat alternating with cold on the jaw. In all her years I have never seen her so miserable. I am a nurse and had no idea that these effects were so common. I had only ever given this med frequently to pt's with a G-tube.  Perhaps their conditions usually made it hard to assess when these occur.,My daughter will never take the med again_ nor will anyone in my family.

142, 1, Vomiting,Depressions_ anxiety_ panic_ restlessness_ insomnia (from anxiety),I was given metaclompromide in the hospital through IV for vomiting and in pill form the following two days. I awoke the next day confused and depressed. I remained extremely depressed_ anxious_ restless_ panicked. I did everything I could to ease the feeling_ I went to the gym_ I returned to the hospital to speak with the doctor_ I spoke with doctor friends. And..I did my own research. I knew that it was the drug that was causing these effects and found out that it blocked dopamine in the brain_ and can cause anxiety and depression in certain persons. I considered quitting work_ but decided to put one step in front of the other for a while and try to make it through this episode. I found out it takes a few weeks for the brain to go back to normal and resume dopamine production. I want to tell you that it DOES get better. Please believe it_ even if you have been taking it for months. The brain resumes making what it needs and it regains its balance. I don't feel ANY of the depression that I felt from that episode_ it is like nothing happened. It took me two weeks_ but then I was fine. If you took it for longer then you may need some more time but I don't think you would need more than a couple months really. Trust me things will go back to normal_ you will be fine!! just manage your life_ you will be fine :) if you need to talk my email is plantar84@yahoo.com,F,28,3  days 2X D,3/30/2012Email,Reglan

145, 1, Nausea during Chemotheraphy,Was prescribed this drug in June 2008_ and immediately started having problems with my teeth being sensitive_ involuntary tongue and mouth movement_ anxiety and trouble sleeping.  I took the generic form (metoclopramide) of Reglan_ not because I requested it_ but because unless your physician specifically orders Reglan_ the pharmacy gives you generic_ which is a cost savings to the insurance company.  Anyway_ now it is March 2012_ and these symptoms continue.  I only took the drug for three months while taking chemo_ but it seems that I will have a lifetime of dealing with the side effects.  I have been diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia_ and am on two drugs_ Hydrocodone for pain in my mouth (feels like a really bad tooth ache)_ and Ativan for anxiety (caused by the constant pain).  Also_ I use a sleeping aid in order to relieve myself of at least 8 hours without the pain and anxiety.  Needless to say_ I highly recommend anyone research this drug before taking it.  It will save you a li,"I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  It is especially hard on females who are considered ""elderly"" (whatever that age may mean).  I was 63 when it was prescribed.

By the 14th day_ I was in a severe depression to the point where I couldn't stand to get out of bed and I cried all day and all night.  I was sent to a psychiatrist - when I told him about the Reglan_ he said he saw at least 4 patients per month with Reglan-related severe depression.  He told me to stop taking it immediately and to dispose of it.  I did.  In three days_ my depression began to lift and_ within a week_ the depression was gone.,Don't take this drug!!!

Scared.,Went to ER two nights ago for migraine symptoms. Have had them for over a week. The doc said he would give me an IV line with Benadryl and anti-nausea medication. The nurse injected it in the line and my throat and crotch got super hot feeling. Not good.Then i got super high like i was stoned and started tweaking. i was seeing the curtain move toward me and things move in the room_ i heard someone whispering to me and thought someone died in the room and i was talking to the dead_ and bugs were flying around. The worst part (like that wasn't bad enough) was my legs started twitching_ like my skin was crawling. My lower torso was practically convulsing_ and i thought about pushing the call button and all of the noise in the room was amplified and i started to get scared.  when nurse came in_ it's like i couldn't really speak or explain myself because i kept forgetting what i was saying. And they let me drive home_ they just gave up on me and said i was sensitive. they asked if my headache was gone and i lied and said yes to get the heck out of the ER_ I thought they were trying to kill me.

I am always severely depressed and constantly think about just ending it all. I don't have the energy to do anything other than just make it through the day. When I first got prescribed the drug I was thrilled because my delayed digestion had been giving me nausea but taking it has become my biggest regret. I originally thought my depression was a result of my new birth control (Implanon) because I started them at the same time and it actually has depression listed as a side effect where as Reglan doesn't but I have never reacted like this to birth control and no one I have talked to on the same type has had any similar symptoms. I had no idea depression was one of the side effects of Reglan but after reading these reviews about so many people with the exact same side effects as me I am convinced that it is what caused this. Do not take Metoclopramide (Reglan) if you can avoid it. I have been off it for a month and am still severely depressed.,F,21,30  days 2X D,8/9/2011Email,Reglan

I litterally had a nervous breakdown about 3 weeks after starting the drug.  I had thoughts of killing my newborn_ giving her up for adoption_ or simply abandoning my whole new life.  I had to go through cycles (plural) of IVF to get my daughter_ so you can  see how crazy I truly was.  I have never been on any anti-depressants in my life_ and never saw a psychiatrist for depression. This drug threw me into a nervous breakdown one Friday afternoon_ to where I had to call my mom to come take care of the baby for 4 weeks until ""life"" didn't make me so anxious.  I couldn't even run simple errands_ or watch TV.  Sitting still for a period of time to watch TV was impossible.  Any show on TV threw me into horrible anxiety attacks. I was prescribed Zoloft and Xanex to counter balance what the Reglan had done.  It took about two weeks for the Zoloft to start kicking in_ but THANK THE LORD for Xanex.  I became agoraphobic and feared even leaving my house.  A few times each night I had panic attacks so bad I would be drenched in the middle of the night and have to take Xanex just to get through them.  I counted the minutes until I could take another Xanex just to get through the next few hours.  BUT_ if this sounds anything like you_ it WILL get better.

Within a day of taking it I experienced extremely severe mental problems that I had never experienced before.  I became suicidal_ experienced major panic attacks and thought I was going insane.  My doctor prescribed Benadryl to counteract the Reglan_ but the damage was done.  I required anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medicines to counteract the effects of the Reglan; even then_ it took months of misery to get the dosages and meds right.  Due to Reglan_ my life was miserable for several years; to this day (17 years later) I still harbor some of the ill effects from this medicine. It frightens me how cavalierly doctors prescribe this drug; a doctor recently suggested I take it to counteract nausea caused by the laxative prep needed for a colonoscopy.

I had to stop breastfeeding anyways because I couldn't function.,I tried getting off the medication but I called my doctor (a different doctor than who prescribed the medication) and she said to go back on and taper off.  I didn't want to do that but I finally did because I coudn't take it anymore.  I am currently on 2.5 mg twice a day and will be stopping completely this week.  The insomnia is still going on.

It took me about 4 weeks to be completely back to normal but I am finally there and you will be too. Since I had a newborn I was told I had post partum_ even though I told the Dr. it was withdrawl from this horrible drug.  3 Dr.'s obviously knew nothing about this drug and prescribed me zoloft for the depression_ xanax for anxiety and ambien cr for the insomnia_ which I then had to stop nursing_ which was the reason I took Reglan to begin with.  I knew it was the Reglan and waited 2 weeks before cosidering the zoloft but ended up giving in and took it.  I felt back to normal in less than 2 weeks which the dr. told me zoloft would take about 4-6 weeks to fully work so I went back to the Dr._ with a print out from this site as well_ and he was amazed at the difference in me.  He knew it was not the zoloft and had me get off it.  I've been off for 3 weeks and feeling great.  I had literally felt like a switch turned off in my head_ I had horrible scary thoughts about everything_ I lost connection to everyone and eveything that was important to me_ I felt like I was ruining my families lives and they would be better off without me_ I couldn't make simple decisions and ended up doing nothing.  This was the hardest thing I have had to go through and I am praying for all of you who are going through this right now.

186, 4, GERD,mild drowsiness_ and tiredness for the first few days.,I found Reglan to work very well for GERD and associated symptoms of bloating and nausea. The drowsiness went away after several days of taking the drug. Reglan should not be used continously for longer than 12 weeks_ due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia. I am surprised by so many negative comments about this drug. I have found Reglan to be helpful_ with little side effects.,M,62,60  days10 3X D,3/26/2011Email,Reglan
187, 1, GERD as a result of anxiety,Sever anxiety_ insomnia_ unable to stay still_ stiff neck and paralyzing feeling in left arm_restless legs_ numbness in face and neck_ choking feeling,I was giving this drug through IV  in the ER then prescribed it till i could follow up with my PCP. When I got to my PCP he said it was a terrible drug and he wanted me to throw it away in his office and not even take it home with me. I knew I had problems with anxiety_ but it had never been as bad as the week i took this drug. It was like it would never go away and i thought i was going crazy_ I convinced myself I had meningitis or a serious disc rupture. Which i kept trying to tell myself I'm only 25 that's probably not the case. My physical symptoms were very real and intense and no one told me the side effects of this drug. it should come with a disclaimer and you should have to sign before you agree to take it. I cant believe they would give someone as paranoid as me and who suffers from serious anxiety this drug. I have stopped taking It for about 24 hours but I still feel like my nerves are on a roller coaster and my neck is very stiff.  Anyone with advise after having used this drug_ please feel free to e mail me.,F,25,5  days10 3X D,3/26/2011Email,Reglan

Within seconds I began to panic_ felt i was going crazy and even thought I was dying.  I was given ativan to calm down and also morphine because the reglan didn't help the migraine.  I have twitched after this experience ( which was around 2003) every day.  My eye lids twitch_ my legs_ arms_ EVERYWHERE!  It is irritating more than anything.  I had NO idea that Reglan caused this until I read there was a lawsuit out for this drug for causing involuntary muscle twitches.,Do not take this drug for migraines.

231, 1, Nausea,Severe anxiety; depression; panic when i was first given the drug via IV in the ER...wanted to rip the IV out of my arm and crawl into a ball and sleep to feel normal again; immediate sense of feeling like I was in a fog and no longer in control of myself; Tachychardia (heart rate skyrocketed to the point where 1 minute after receiving the meds_ I was surrounded by about 8 frantic doctors and nurses and hooked up to a bunch of different heart machines and monitors); Physical side effects I received from the drug caused them to admit me to the hospital so they could monitor me,"This is hands down the worst medication I have ever taken. I was in the ER for a viral infection when they gave me this. Immediately upon receiving it in my IV_ I knew something was wrong and nearly 6 weeks later_ I am still struggling with depression_ panic attacks_ and anxiety. For the first few weeks_ I literally thought I was going crazy & losing my mind and thought I would never recover. Since then_ the feelings of ""craziness"" and being completely out of control of my own mind & body have worn off_ but I am still extremely depressed and anxious. I have been too anxious to be in public/with people so I have been fairly isolated and spend much of my time crying and wishing I could go back and insist they didn't give this med. to me. Nothing gives me joy anymore and I feel totally hopeless_ but I also know that things will get better. I just hope it is sooner rather than later. This drug NEEDS to be taken off the market. The side effects in no way outweigh the benefits. Actually_ this didn't even seem to help my nausea-still felt sick and was unable to eat for weeks.

264, 1, Extreme Morning Sickness,Neurological Reaction_ Seizures_ close to death.,I was given Reglan by IV for a Friday Night-Sunday Noon. Hours before I was being discharged from the hospital after days of care my mother noticed I was acting very oddly.  I was staring at the ceiling_ when she realized my eyes were rolling back in my head causing my neck to then follow.  Quickly she had nurses in the room with pure shock on their faces and an MD who had no idea what to do.  Immediately following the eyes rolling back_ and the neck rolling back_ extreme rigidity and seizures followed.  For 2 hrs they tried to figure out what to do while I suffered scared_ no control over my eyes_ neck or body. They decided a shot of Benadryl would do the trick.  I had about 15minutes of relief and it all started back_ even worse.  I had my tongue and lips swelling up and down_ extreme changes in my blood pressure_ heart beat_ rigidity_ seizures and no control over my neck and eyes once again.  They bring another MD to try to solve the puzzle and after another 2hrs of suffering they finally decided that Morphine doses along with a muscle relaxer would keep me until the Reglan was out of my system.  This was the most pain I have ever been through_ not to mention the scariest experience of my life. When it takes 7 nurses & 2 MDs to stop pain_ with only hopeful looks on their faces there is something wrong. Reglan was not worth this and NO ONE should have to go through this experience.,F,21,3  days,12/18/2009,Reglan
265, 4, nausea_ bloating_ gastroparesis,moderate depression_ insomnia,Even though I am experiencing depression and insomnia_ I will push through it_ and continue taking Reglan as long as it helps. Before Reglan_ I was unable to eat solid food without experiencing severe bloating and pain in stomach and upper right abdomen near ribs_ severe cramping_ diarrhea and generally feeling ill. Had gall bladder removed a yr ago for these problems_ but all symptoms remain. Once my Reglan dose was adjusted up to 20mg  2x a day_ I can now eat small meals at least_ and the nausea and most of the pain and bloating are gone. I am undergoing tests to find the root cause_ Reglan is just a temporary measure until the true culprit is found and treated_ but Reglan has saved my life_ the benefits for me outweigh the side effects at this time_ and I pray that Tardive Diskenesia or other sever side effects stays at bay ... I don't think I can stand going back to being so so sick as I was before this miracle drug was prescribed....,F,49,7  months,12/13/2009,Reglan
266, 1, Breast Milk Production,Severe depression / Anxiety / Extreme Restlessness / Could not be alone / Felt like everything was the end of the world,I took reglan for about 2 months and my breast milk production increased as needed.  Towards the end of the 2 months I had feelings of depression and anxiety.  I then had a mental break down where I couldn't go to work or be alone and I cryed for 3 days straight.  I thought I needed to go to a mental institution.  I stopped taking it after the first day of my breakdown and went in to see my doctor who perscribed me Zoloft and then after two pills of Zoloft I ended up in the E.R. because of insomnia_ extreme restlessness_ tingling of arms and legs_ vomiting_ diahrea_ loss of apetite and the shakes.  I think most of these affects were due to the withdrawls of Reglan.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT TAKE REGLAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FORMULA IS BETTER THAN THE EFFECTS OF REGLAN,F,26,2  months,12/13/2009,Reglan
267, 1, ER trip for vomitting,THIS IS A TERRIBLE DRUG_ BUT YOU WILL RECOVER!! I am posting this as a sign of hope to people who are suffering_ because I suffered for 9 months after taking this ONCE intravenously at the hospital. SEVERE anxiety_ depression_ panic-attacks_ and insomnia...I had NEVER experienced any of these before in my life. Doctors denied the connection to Reglan_ until I PROVED it through online research. I took Clonopin 8x a day at first and Sonata (for sleep). Slowly_ I weaned myself off the meds after 8 months_ but the symptoms_ though milder_ were still debilitating. I am the biggest skeptic in the world_ but the ONLY thing that saved my life/returned me to normal (and I am happily normal now!) was-- I know it sounds stupid-- clinical hypnosis. I saw a woman named Carole Reifsynder in New Jersey and after 6 weeks_ I felt an enormous burden had been lifted.For those of you suffering_ this will pass-- I know you don't believe it_ but it WILL! You are in my heart.,NEVER TAKE THIS!,F,29,1  days,12/10/2009,Reglan

The 1st time led to a severe suicidal depression_ which required a lot of therapy_ antidepressants and antianxiety meds to overcome (a couple years worth). I never connected that depression to the reglan though. I'm glad to have found this site_ which convinced me to get off reglan now_ when it was beginning to have the same effect.,Propulsid had worked for me sometime back. Reglan is dangerous_ and if doctors prescribe it_ they should definitely stay in touch with the patient for signs of depression and the like.,M,54,6  months,11/29/2009,Reglan

Symptoms started in April 2008_ by June 2008 I was in Psych for 3 days. Continued to see Psych Docs until Sept. 2009. It was a living hell.  Nothing helped. I went to the drug store with a script for Pristiq and found out there was an interaction with Reglan so I stopped the Reglan. My legs immediately stopped moving and some of the other symptoms left as well. My side effects are shortness of breath_chest heaviness_sweaty hands_light headed_involuntary mouth/movement_anxiety_under arm rash.  Some of them are getting better with time.

Side effects - life long tremors_ involuntary muscle spasms_ akathisia_ severe anxiety and Tardive dyskinesia.,Under any circumstances_ please do NOT take this medication.  It has literally ruined my life.  I am a young woman who is damaged for the rest of my life because of Reglan. This drug blocks dompamine from your brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter located in our Central Nervous System making it one of our most important neurotransmitters.  Without dopamine_ you can develop neurological conditions_ suicidal ideations and behavioral problems.  This drug should be banned. If you do take this drug_ DO NOT take this drug for more than 3 months_ as it's only approved by the FDA for 3 months.  I was left on the drug for 6 months and my brain became damaged.

I was terrified that the reglan had permenantly damaged my brain and really suffered for about 5 weeks.  I am almost seven weeks out from the onset of the symptoms and am feeling MUCH better and pretty much back to myself.  I was prescribed Ambien CR for the insomnia and am still using it for now as my sleep is not quite back to normal yet.  I was prescribed valium for the anxiety but didn't start on an antidepressant as the psychiatrist felt like things would level out within a couple of months.  She was right.

The Nurse told my wife that I was one of few who were allergic to the Drug Reglan and that all medical personnel was told of this side effect_ but they had never had any one who was allergic.

277, 1, Gastroparesis,"Was prescribed reglan in March 2007 and began suffering from severe anxiety and depression in September (at least_ that is when it became very noticeable). Began seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed Lexapro (depression) and clonopin (anxiety). My gastroenterologist substituted domperidone for the reglan in October and some of the anxiety and depression symptoms began to subside. However_ the Lexapro and clonopin began contributing to symptoms of there own and I was advised that_ having an addictive personality_ I might want to discontinue these drugs. This is not as easy as just quitting; however_ I lucked onto a website that helped me gradually wean myself from these drugs. Today_ I no longer take presciption medications and have adopted an eating plan that includes a regime referred to as proper ""food combining"".

278, 1, Gastroperiesis,Depression_ Suicidal thoughts_ Severe Anxiety,I posted on this forum about one year ago after having been on Reglan for about 8 weeks.  The effects of the medication were one of the most significant things that has ever happened to me in my life.  I was truly suicidal and beginning to formulate a plan to kill myself.  Thank god something in the back of my mind told me what was happening to me was an effect of the Reglan.  I stopped the medication and after a few days I felt the depression lift somewhat and the Suicidal thoughts went away.  It took considerably longer for the anxiety to lift.  For weeks I was worried_ anxious and just not feeling right.  Several doctors I spoke to want to put me on a variety of psychiatric drugs_ but I wanted to see if things would correct by themselves.  For the first two weeks after I stopped_ I found Benadryl effective a dampening my anxiety.  After two weeks I found_ I didnt need it anymore_ but cut caffeine out of my life altogether_ because I found I could not tolerate the agitated effect caffeinated coffee or tea gave me.  This forum was a god send for me.  During the first few weeks I found myself pouring over the entries.  I found it so comforting that I wasnt crazy; it was a bad reaction to a medication.  I found it took about 60 or so days for me to feel fully back to normal.  If you are going through this_ just remember_ it gets better,M,42,8  weeks,10/10/2009,Reglan

280, 1, gastroparesis,problems staying asleep then not sleeping at all_ depression_ suicidal thoughts_ anxiety_ loneliness,I took this med for about 2 months. After a month I started having problems staying asleep. Then I could barely sleep at all during the last month I took it. During the last days of the two month period I started vomiting and having suicidal thoughts. I took myself to the hospital. I called my mom and started to cry. Then I finally saw the nurse and told him about the vomiting. I then said that I thought I was depressed and immediately started to cry again. Then I cried again with the psychiatrist. I was given anti-depressants but they didn't say anything about the reglan. I made the connection myself after reading the side effects in the med info and stopped taking reglan. After 1 week I was no longer depressed but still have anxiety. I stopped taking the anti-depressants after that first week. After 4 weeks I still have anxiety but it seems to be wearing off. The back of my head and neck seem to be tense. I might go back to taking the antidepressants to see if it helps with the anxiety. I will post back again later on for an update.,M,26,2  months,10/6/2009,Reglan

By the end of the 30 days_ I started to feel some depression.  I stopped the drug and within 3 days experienced severe anxiety/nervousness.  I went to the dr. and was prescribed Lexapro (anti-depressant) and Xanax (anti-anxiety).  After being on the anit-depressant for 2 weeks I felt MUCH better.  I no longer need the anti-anxiety but will continue to take the anti-depressant until my dr. says I can ween off of it.

There are two more medications out there that help. One is Euthomysine(sp) and the other is Domperidone ( its approved everywhere except for the US)The side effects are still affecting me and I m taking three types of Anxity meds in which I ve never had to take before.

While taking the medication_ the side effects were livable_ but after going cold turkey I thought I was going to die or lose my mind.  My doctor put me back on the reglan at a lower dose and tapered off_ which helped the anxiety_ and put me on Lexapro.

289, 1, Increase Milk Production,despondence_ flat hopeless affect,My wife was on this for months.  It got to the point where I didn't know who I was married to anymore.  She cared about our child and making sure he was adequately supplied while nursing_ but at the same time she lost all interest and care about anything else.  She wanted to give up_ throw our jobs and friends away and move.  There was moodiness but mostly she was totally disengaged all the time.  People who new her were on eggshells around her.  I witnessed many of the psychological symptoms described by others_ but the most detrimental was the denial.  The negative effects of this drug were an unnoticeable slow buildup.  For a long time we dismissed these feelings as part of being a new mom.  It got the the point where I could see signs of dependency and I sought help for us.  Our marriage was suffering and our child was able to get adequate nutrition without having to nurse as much.  Since stopping the medication our communication has been restored and she is able to once again laugh and smile genuinely.  She's like she was before.  This drug isn't worth it.  The denial and change in demeanor is noticeable by family_ friends_ and colleagues and it can cause long term detriment to relationships and careers.

I was supposed to have a ultrasound_ but I demanded to stop treatment so i could recover at home from the reglan (this has happened before and the doctors didnt do anything about me twitching and having a anxiety attack!!!) I slept it off and I now  cannot sleep due to the side effects.,dont ever take this. Its not worth it. The skin crawling experience occurs in about 1 out of every 1000 patients.

I couldn't keep my mouth open or shut my eyes_ I couldn't breathe_ I couldn't control my tongue_ my limbs were going crazy_ and I'm pretty convinced my neck was trying to break itself. It was probably the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. I waited an hour and a half in the emergency room just to get some damn benadryl to stop it. Thankfully_ it did.

308, 1, slow stomach emptying,ANHEDONIA!!! and much more.,This is my second posting. I have been doing a great deal of research about Reglan. Please do some research on Anhedonia and how to treat it. I took Reglan for 8 months 4x a day at 10mgs. I have been off Reglan 4.5 months. Zoloft did not work for me_ but does work for some. Nortriptyline did help but could not handle constipation side effect. My doctor has been asking me to consider Wellbutrin as it works on Dopamine. Reglan disrupts dopamine in our brains and causes us to become unbalanced. Anhedonia can be a direct complication of this process. Mirapex is recommended for restoring dopamine health. I have not had a chance to speak with my doctor about this but will do so on Monday. A healthy diet_ staying connected to friends and family_ and natural supplements that boost brain and nuerotransmission health have also been helpful.,F,45,8  months,6/7/2009Email,Reglan

310, 1, IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Confusion_ inability to focus or concentrate_ forgetfulness_ restlessness,I took this drug for 1-2 days for relief of painful colon spasms related to IBS-C. At work I would stare at my computer screen trying to remember why I was staring at my computer screen. My legs were restless and I felt like I could not stay seated in my chair. I had trouble understanding what people were saying to me_ and trouble forming complete thoughts and sentences. I've had bad reactions to various medications before_ and this time_ after researching the side effects_ I knew I needed to stop taking it immediately. Didn't help the IBS spasms anyway. They've just put my mom on this medication - she seems hopeful it will help her eat. She reduced her dosage to 5mg and it seems to be helping her. She got dizzy with 10mg.

A few hours after the 2nd dose_ my throat felt like it was being squeezed with pressure over the aorta vein which was tender and felt like it was bulging. It was like someone pushing on the left side of my throat directly on the vein.  My neck became very stiff_ and I could not turn my neck without moving my head. It hurt on a scale of 8 out of 10 and increased when I moved a certain way. My entire face hurt. I had to go to the emergency room where they gave me a high dose of steroid and Benadryl.  Within 15 minues_ I had some relief from the pain and tightness in my throat and the stiff neck. However_ 15 hours later_ there is some tenderness and pain in the neck area near the aorta.  The diagnosis was allergic reaction.  While it did help cut the migraine pain in half_ it caused FAR more pain and serious side effects.

During this time_ I've taken metoclopramide a few times and had terrible side effects (starting within hours of taking it). If I stop the metoclopramide_ the symptoms go away after 1-2 days_ so I believe there is something about the combination of the drugs that increases the side effects of the metoclopramide. I have taken metoclopramide on its own before and not had any side effects. Suffice it to say_ that I will be throwing the metoclopramide in the trash and trying some other therapies (including homeopathy - honey/acv_ digestive enzymes_ etc) that seem to work better than even the PPIs,F,33,3  times,1/16/2009Email,Reglan

When I tapered off the medication is when I started getting the nausea and diarrhea - then the feelings of anxiety set in. I do NOT have a history of anxiety so I was very freaked out. My arms would start to warm and tingle and then the anxiety and nausea would kick in. I thought I was going crazy. I wasn't comfortable in my own skin. My OB/GYN chalked it up to post-partum anxiety/depression. But_ I searched and found that some people do experience withdrawl issues with Reglan. I confirmed with the pharmasist.

Amazingly_ the surgeon_ the anesthesiologist_ and the ER doctor I finally had to see did NOT know that Reglan could cause these effects. They all thought I was a hysterical female. I figured it out myself after requesting my hospital records & researching every drug that was administered to me during surgery.

In that time I have only had one episode of reflux and_ to be honest_ I probably deserved it since I ate very_ very spicy food just to see if the reglan would work in extreme situations. Note that even though I refluxed_ it wasn't as severe as it usually was. Overall_ I would say reglan has worked extremely well for me. My doctor explained in great detail the potential risks and I decided to try it rather than have surgery since I'm all about less invasive procedures when possible.

393, 1, Increase Breastmilk Production,Depression_ Skin crawling_ Severe Anxiety,I was prescribed Reglan to increase my milk supply - which it did do. I was only on Reglan for 2 days when I started experiencing severe anxiety and depression. I had never experienced any of these symptoms to that degree in my life and could only trace it back to the Reglan that I was taking. I would not recommend this drug to my worst enemy and it needs to be pulled off the market immediately.,F,29,2  days,6/9/2008,Reglan

Went to my family doctor and was also diagnosed with anxiety and was told that I should see a psychiatrist and was prescribed Lexapro which i also will not take. I printed out these pages to bring to my doctor and was ignored when asked about possibilities of having some sort of damage due to Reglan use. While everyone reacts differently to medications I advise most people DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG UNDER ANY CURCUMSTANCES. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU WILL HAVE A SERIOUS REACTION TO IT. on a side note: Are there any other persons who have had success in regaining their mental alertness. I feel like I am always in a dream. I have left email and hope I can get some good news or words of encouragement,M,39,2  weeks,6/6/2008Email,Reglan
395, 1, Barret's esophagus_ GERD,I gradually became more and more depressed to the point that my family noticed it. Not recognizing Reglan as the cause_ I saw a psychotherapist. When it didn't improve at all_ I began to suspect something chemical but I couldn't figure what. What drove me to do research was a trembling anxiety attack_ something I'd never had before. I also developed premature heart beats (15_000 per day) and had to take Tambocor for it. My BP_ normally low_ went up. All symptoms disappeared when I quit the Reglan.,It worked to control GERD_ but it wasn't worth it. I only found out about the depression side effect by accident...no MD suggested it as a possible cause of my problems. Within 1 week of going off it_ the depression lessened. Anxiety attack never happened again_ even once! I now only take half dose of Tambocor and I suspect I may not even need that but MD is afraid to chance my going off it.,F,64,2  years,6/2/2008,Reglan
396, 1, nausea gastroparesis,Depression_ severe skin agitation_ anxiety_ suicidal thoughts.  Ended up in a psych unit for 3 weeks where I was simply put on a anti-depessant which did nothing for me except make me foggy.  Found out about the gruesome side effects of Reglan at this web site.,Was on 5mg/meal for 3 years_ had gall bladder removed in hopes of solving problem.  When that didn't work was put on a dose of 10/mg/meal.  That's when the severe side effects exploded on the scene.  Nothing ever did solve my nausea problem.  Stopped using Splenda helped.  Will never use Reglan again_ it made my life hell.,M,64,3  years,5/30/2008Email,Reglan
397, 2, Milk Production,Jittery; Drowsiness almost lethargic feeling; anxiety; feeling unusually down and helpless,I was taking this for milk production for just a few days and determined that it was the cause of the side effects I was having.  I stopped taking it and feel 100% better.  I was unaware of the severe side effects.  It was my baby's pediatrician that mentioned that these side effects existed and he recommended I not take it.  Weird coming from the pediatrician.  He did note that some people have none of these side effects.  I felt these side effects almost immediately so I think if you feel these or other side effects that basically make you feel crazy you should contact your Dr.,F,32,3  days,5/27/2008,Reglan
398, 3, Gastroparesis,Depression_ anxiety_ diarrhea,Drug has really helped the bloating and nausea associated with the condition. I'm ONLY taking 10mg once a day.  Unfortunately_ soon after beginning Reglan I experienced heightened bouts of depression alternating with anxiety.  I attributed it to other things in my life. Then the uncontrolable episodes of diarrhea began.  Symptoms continue to persist during the five months on Reglan.  It has made me virtually housebound.  I traced the onset of symptoms to the start of the Reglan.  Having begun research today_ I stumbled upon this site and was amazed and enlightened.  Why did an Endocrinologist_ Cardiologist and Internist all not offer a warning to this med.  Reglan definitley helped my gastroparisis_ but I can't handle the side effects and will begin weaning off today.

I have to take Klonopin with it sometimes because it worsens the muscle pain I already have due to fibromyalgia_ and it increases my already high anxiety level.  The side effects are pretty awful_ but my gastroparesis is so bad that I am willing to try anything at this point_ including increasing the dosage of the Reglan.  Thus far_ I have not noticed a difference in the severity of the reflux_ which is the worst symptom I get from the gastroparesis.  I have also been overeating at night_ which really doesn't help_ and has only started happening since I began taking the Reglan; it seems to be due to a combination of fatigue from the medication and the reflux itself tricking me into feeling ""hungry.""",F,29,14  days,5/5/2008,Reglan
400, 1, to increase breastmilk production,depression_ anxiety_ sleeplessness,I was prescribed Reglan to increase milk production... while it did work very well for this purpose_ it also resulted in me spiraling into a depression -- something I have never before experienced.  After researching the drug (and finding this site) I stopped taking the drug_ and began to feel better almost immediately.  A few weeks later (after my milk supply began to dry up) I figured I'd give it another shot_ just to make sure that I hadn't simply been experiencing normal postpartum feelings.  Within a day of taking the drug_ I started to feel horribly depressed again_ and that's when it became abundantly clear to me that I could not tolerate this drug.  I haven't taken it since.,F,39,6  weeks,4/22/2008Email,Reglan

You may wish to scroll back and read my posting. Fortunately I suffered no long term effects from this (poison).It is unbelievable it is still on the market. It took me almost 8 months for all the physical and mental symptoms to abate. I thought it might be helpful to some of you fellow suffers for me to post the drugs that I used to finally beat this thing. The drugs mentioned below were prescribed by my primary care physician and later by a phycharist. He said it was one of the most troublesome drugs on the market. I did not file a lawsuit. Fortunately the physical symptoms were mild in my case ( trembleing of my left hand and facial masking.They went away after about 3 weeks but the depression_ crying_and anxiety took about eight months to completely disappear.

We had no known side effects at the time...over the next couple of years she had major language delays and sensory issues.  When I was pregnant with my last child I was extremely sick.  So sick that Zofran would not work on its own.  After a hospital stay because of dehydration my OB prescribed home health care and a reglan pump as well as Zofran.  The combination worked.  Again I had no known side effects.  My concern is that I have 4 children two of the four are very intelligent ( not being obnoxious - things just come very easy for them.)  The other two who both had reglan either directly our through my pregnancy have major language delays.  The older of the two has been diagnosed with Sensory integration disorder_ auditory processing disorder_ visual processing disorder and a severe expressiv,I am wondering if there is anyone else out there that has had a similar situation with this medication and their children?

The intern who was assisting him at the time assured us that if there were side effects such as he had mentioned that they would go away when the medicine was discontinued.  This was a complete lie.  We stopped the medicine over 3 weeks ago and even though we were assured that it would get out of his system quickly_ he has not changed. Another doctor assred us that he gave out the medicine as if it were ""candy"".  I certainly don't want to ""trick or treat"" at his house!   We pray daily for help.

I could not fuction and had an overwhelming feeling of despair and doom. Thoughts of suicide.,My GI doctor prescribed 10mg of Reglan twice a day. She warned me of the movement side effects but never mentioned depression or anxiety_ if she had I NEVER would have taken that chance! After taking it for five weeks I started to feel the anxiety and it got so bad I was afraid to drive and leave my house. I researched the medication on line and only found the regular warnings. It took another four weeks for me to search Reglan and my symptoms next to it and it brought up all these people with the EXACT symptoms I was having and I stopped taking it right away! I have been off for a week and this week has been pure HELL! All symptoms intensified and I would think of suicide. Im a bit better but very worried that it will come back and take longer to go away.  My doctors and pharmacists all deny that its the Reglan that caused the severe depression and anxiety.

My milk production dropped off once I returned to work and was not able to breastfeed/pump as frequently. Disliked side effects - was very tired despite sleeping well_ and felt somewhat depressed. However_ side effects disappeared 1-2 days after completing prescription (2-week cycle). Started a second cycle of Reglan in order to maintain increased breast milk output_ now playing with dose to see if I can get by with only one tablet a day (rather than 3) and keep up breastfeeding without negative side effects. Would recommend a trial of Reglan if your breast milk production has decreased and if other basic remedies recommended by your MD (such as more fluid intake_ more sleep_ increased caloric intake etc) are not helping.,F,37,15  days,10/7/2007,Reglan

Needless to say_ I experienced the most horrifying ordeal anyone can imagine.  I was on the medication for about 4 months_ which is beyond the recommended treatment_ and found out the hard way what the side effects were.  I was never told about the side effect of suicidal thoughts_ suicidal tendencies_ anxiety_ or insomnia.  It took me about 6-7 months of antidepressant to finally get my life back in order.  It took an eternity for the drug to finally get out of my system and start functioning normally.  If anyone is taking this medicine_ please think twice about the side effects before taking it.

He concurs that the Reglan is the problem - recommended she stop the med and start the Prozac again - which was working.

I have no history of depression or anxiety.  I took Reglan approx. 8 weeks and was hit with terrible depression_ anxiety_ insomnia_ and feeling incredibly uneasy -- all of which are outside the norm for me. I consider myself to be a highly functional person who is able to deal with a lot of stress.  At the time_ the problems I was having were attributed to post-partum depression.  After doing some research_ I now realize that_ more than likely_ these problems were due to the Reglan.  Unfortunately_ no one warned me about these possible side effects.  If given warning_ I would have stopped taking the drug immediately. The 8 weeks I took the medication and the several months following were a very bad experience for me.

I nearly died from respiratory dyskinesia when I had the dystonic reaction to the Reglan. Now 12 years later I still have fairly severe dystonia and am unable to walk or move normally. This drug gave me a lifelong disabling movement disorder.,This is an awful drug that should be taken off of the market. I have met many people who also have had severe reactions to Reglan. This drug can kill you or leave you permanently disabled and a wheelchair user like it did to me. Tardive dyskinesia and dystonia are very difficult to live with and can be severely disabling. Don't take reglan and get off of it if you are currently taking it. I was only exposed for about 5 days via IV.

She would have other problems and be put in the hospital where she would be taken off it and improve_ then they'd put her back on it again. I pray no one else goes through what she_ and we did.,F,76, ,5/23/2007,Reglan

My mother was on this drug for 6 months for stomach problems related to Diabetes. The side effects were horrible_ but the doctors didn't know what was causing it. One of her doctors mentioned that some of the symtoms she was having might be caused by the reglan but even the neurologist they sent her to seemed to think she had developed parkinsons disease.  After researching the side effects of Reglan I had her taken off of the drug and within a week most of the side effects were gone.  The problem with this drug is that the effects can be permanent and the longer you are on it the more likely this could be the case.  We've switched her to Domperidone (Motillium)_ it provides her with the same relief without the nasty side effects.,F,,6  months,4/23/2007,Reglan

496, 1, GERD,I suffered from severe depression on Reglan.  It worked fabulously for my GERD_ which had been very severe and had not responded to any other meds.  However_ I experienced a number of side effects including severe drowsiness (which decreased after I cut my dose in half)_ mental fuzziness--inability to concentrate and think clearly -- and mild hand tremors.  The worst side effects were insomnia_ anxiety_ agitation and severe depression_ which I didn't associate with the drug_ because at the time I was feeling quite ill and also undergoing a career change.  I had classic symptoms: apathy_ inability to get out of bed_ depressed mood_ feelings of hopelessness. I had no prior history of depression.  I went on anti-depressants which improved the anxiety_ agitation_ and sleeplessness but not the depression.

Now_ I am seeing a doctor who is trying to fix my dopamine levels. Reglan causes depression and like symptoms by messing up neurotransmitters in the brain as it is a dopamine antagonist.

I stopped taking Reglan after 3 doses. The side affects are so terrible that I will not be taking it again.,F,39,2  days,6/5/2006Email,Reglan

550, 2, severe gastropresis,I am generally a happy person but this drug caused severe DEPRESSION. Nothing made me happy even though  intelectually I knew I should be happy I was not.  Also it caused me to be apathetic.,This drug did help with my gastric motility.  I did not experience the nausea and vomiting with it.  After 3 weeks I quit the reglan (because of depression) and the nausea and vomiting returned.  My Doctor encouraged me to try reglan again and the depression came back and hit hard.  Reglan is a dopamine inhibitor and crosses the blood brain barrier.  The depression is just not worth it.,F,43,3  weeks,3/24/2006,Reglan

Reglan has helped ease those symptoms. However_ it has scary side effects and the manuf advises not to take it for long periods of time. I think it has a definite impact on the pain I experience with Fibromyalgia. Some days_ it's hell. Not sure if it is worth it yet. I win and I lose_ if you know what I mean.

562, 1, Migraine/dizziness,Severe anxiety_ parkinson like syndrome_ depression and mental dullness.  Absolutely a horrific experience!!,I went into the ER for head pressure and dizziness.  The Dr. prescribed Reglan/Benadryl in an IV for me.  Not only did it not work - but within 48 hours of leaving the ER - I was suffering from severe anxiety (I have never had a problem with anxiety in my life). Then I started having muscle tremors with my legs_ feet_ arms and neck.  Additionally_ my ability to walk and talk was greatly diminished.  After several more days the anxiety disappeared and was replaced with mental dullness.  It has been 2 months since I had Reglan and I have improved a lot - although I am still not at 100%.  I would caution anyone who has been prescribed this product to seriously consider these life altering side effects  and from what I now understand - they can sometimes be irreversible.,F,37,1  days,8/31/2005,Reglan

The Reglan does seem to constipate me some - which is a welcome change from my IBS type of upset stomach.  My doctor said some of her patients take Reglan if they have IBS - even without a headache.  That is what I have been doing - if I get too constipated I just skip a dose or two.  I need to ask more questions about its long-term use but overall am VERY pleased that this med does what it is supposed to and has helped me very much.,F,41,4  weeks,2/26/2005Email,Reglan
