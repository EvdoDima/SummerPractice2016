0, 5, Hep-C Treatment,This drug will give you a terrible itch_ and many experience rash. I experienced extreme itch that was uncontrollable. I developed sores on my arms which eventually scarred. You have to eat 20 grams of fat with each dose_ 3 times a day.,This is a terrible drug. It is hell to have to work while taking this medication. BUT_ it increases your chance of a cure from 50% to 85% more or less. The pain is worth the cure_ but it's a hard long road.Know that there are good days around the corner_ the bad days don't last forever.,M,26,4  months750 mg 3X D,5/16/2013Email,Incivek
