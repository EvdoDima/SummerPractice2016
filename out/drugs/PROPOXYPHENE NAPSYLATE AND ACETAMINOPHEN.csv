0, 1, Posterior Labrum Repair,Constipation,"I had been taking Percocet 5's after my (MAJOR) shoulder surgery and was doing quite well.  Started physical therapy 4 weeks after surgery and was then put on darvocet.  Doc stated ""it would get me through physical therapy and i shouldn't hurt much""  well I call B.S.  It was like taking a glorified tylenol.  So I then went and read up on darvocet and it's pretty much a placebo drug.  Something to make your mind think your not in pain.  This is nothing more then 800 mg's of tylenol.",M,23,30  days,4/24/2008,Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen
1, 3, Pain after maxilary sinus surgery,Possible headache_ dry mouth,Because I had been under general anesthesia in the morning I am not sure this drug caused the headache.  I took one tablet of propoxyphene napsylate/ Acetaminophen 100/625 before leaving the surgery center and another 3-4 hours later as pain in the surgical area increased.  The pain was reduced in about 20 minutes.  Then I tried to sleep and dozed off and on for about an hour_ when I became aware of fairly strong headache above my eyes so I couldn't sleep.  Headache has lessened but not gone away after another hour or so.,M,65, ,1/30/2008,Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen
2, 4, Thobing Sinus Headache,Drowsiness but that's what I wanted. The pain was keeping me from sleeping.,I had some weird version of the flu. Had an intense pulsing sinus headache which intensify every 10 seconds. I hadn't had a full night of sleep in about 3 days. These tabs helped immensely. The pain went away and I slept soundly although I was up 4 hours later almost on the dot and would need another dose.,M,34, ,2/5/2003,Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen
