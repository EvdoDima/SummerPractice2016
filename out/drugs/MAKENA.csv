0, 3, pre-term labor,I was able to carry two babies to term using this and at the time was highly satisfied because of course healthy babies_ but I've had some health problems since then with super short menstrual cycles (15 days) 18 months after having the babies.  The doctor has said both times it was because my body wasn't making enough progesterone anymore.  I don't really know if it was the drug but before I was pregnant with my second child (first that I used Makena with) I had a very predictable 28 day cycle.  I really wonder if my body just won't make its own progesterone anymore.  This has also come with terrible migraines where I can't drive because my vision changes and bad mood swings. These are all symptoms of low progesterone. I just wonder. . . but I'd probably do it all again for healthy babies.,,F,31,3  months1*weekly,5/30/2014,Makena
