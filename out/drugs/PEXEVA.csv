0, 4, Depression/anxiety,Very tired_ lowered sex drive_ difficulty reaching orgasm_ laziness (stopped running)_ slight weight gain_ vivid dreams,Really did wonders for my anxiety and depression. Made me feel very happy. My only complaints are regarding the lethargy and sexual side effects. Other than that_ it's been wonderful.,F,37,6  months20mg 1X D,2/17/2011,Pexeva
1, 3, Depression/Anxiety,Difficulty orgasm_ low libod_ small weight gain.  Some fogginess and laziness,Seems to be a slight improvement over the regular Paxil; it's a different salt so it is released differently.  I didn't notice the shocks and the extreme withdrawal when forgetting to take the medicine like Paxil.  Maybe worth a try if you really like Paxil.  Less sedating than CR,M,29,2  months20mg 1X D,7/19/2010,Pexeva
2, 4, Anxiety / Depression,Sexual Dysfunction_ occasional fast or irregular heartbeat,Out of all the anti-depressants I've been on (which is A LOT)_ this has definitely helped me the most.. Im so happy about that too_ I was getting desperate. The only negative thing I have to say about this is the annoying sexual side effects.. Ughh_ I can't orgasm anymore and that's not really helping my depression. Despite all that_ Im still so much better than before. :) As far as helping my anxiety; W o w_ social anxiety is four times better. General anxiety is much more controllable too. I don't think I've had a panic attack in forever. So_ yay!,F,19,4  months40 mg 1X D,5/1/2010Email,Pexeva
