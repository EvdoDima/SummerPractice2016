0, 1, High cholesterol,Prevastatin- profound muscle weakness_ joint pain and persistent malaise while on it & had trouble just 'getting through the day' - so my MD thought I was depressed! So weak I could hardly drive...so I recently stopped it- and I feel less weak_ more engaged and able to look forward to the day but still have no muscle tone_ have new hiatal hernia_ inquinal hernias_ tear in rotator cuff_ and random stinging pins and needles feeling in my legs. Prevastatin is the worst!  I hope for an antidote - I walk everyday but feel like I still have residual effects - the contrast to my life before Prevastatin (going to the gym_ working_ getting things done and looking forward to life - and now actually OLD_ weak_ and even my facial expression is dropping at rest and was not like that before...it was taking a toll on my marriage and relationships.,FDA needs to inform physicians- drug reps push so much misinformation- and knowing the truth after the fact may be too late!,F,61,9  months30,5/25/2016Email,Pravachol
1, 1, High cholesterol  ct calcium score,WRETCHED sore throat. I thought I had strep! Sore neck and shoulders. Pain in elbows. Some bizarre dreams. I did not tolerate Lipitor or Crestor and now I add pravastatin to the list. There are others and I will try.,I had the Boston heart health labs and I recommend it. It showed (among many other fascinating things) that I am 4.5 times more likely to experience negative side effects from statins so pravastatin is one of a few that is supposed to be better for me. Not so!,F,60,10  days10,5/16/2016,Pravachol

28, 3, to reduce cholesterol caused by RX,"Last few years have had severe muscle soreness and weakness in lower legs.  Also foot cramps in last few months and extremely sensitive to squeezing my legs or arms.   My memory is also getting worse!  I thought it was due to the 5 mg of prednisone I've been on since my kidney transplant in 1997.  But now I'm thinking otherwise.  I quite taking Pravachol three weeks ago and hope these symptoms will improve.  Otherwise I""m healthy as a horse!",I'm a 62 year old female on anti rejection drugs for kidney transplant.  One drug was Serolumus which caused cholesterol readings to be abnormally high - therefore was put on Pravachol.  With the 40 mg once a day for 16 years_ my readings were under 200.  I'm thinking I'm better off with higher readings and less pain.  My family history has no heart problems at all.  I'm hoping for relief soon.,F,62,14  years40 1X D,5/16/2013Email,Pravachol

37, 2, High cholesterol,Constant lower back pain_ panic/anxiety attacks_ numbness and constant tingling in both shoulders_ arms and hands_ legs always felt heavy_ becoming more and more tired every day I took the medication.,I first started on Crestor.  Over a period of a year and a half on Crestor_ I developed constant lower back pain_ heaviness and eventually pain in both of my legs_ and when the doctor doubled my medication from daily 40 MG to 80 MG_ extreme anxiety and panic attacks to the point where I couldn't sleep.  Then the doctor switched me over to daily 40 MG Lipitor.  Within a month_ all of the side effects of Crestor remerged.  I stopped taking the medication.  The last statin was Pravachol.  For six months I again slowly developed chronic lower back pain_ heaviness and pain in my legs_ and constant tingling in both hands.  When my dosage was increased to 80 MG_ the lower back pain intensified_ the numbness in both of my shoulders_ arms_ and hands became unbearable_ and the anxiety and panic attacks returned in full force and sleep was not possible.  I have now stopped taking any statins.  The doctor either will have to come up with something different_ not a statin_ or I will simply die with clogged arteries.  I walk over two miles every day along with other exercise_ try to eat nothing fried_ etc.  It has taken a little over two weeks for all the side effects to mostly go away.  There is still some slight numbness and tingling in my left hand_ the lower back pain has mostly subsided_ and I can go on my daily walks without feeling that I have lead weights strapped to both legs!!

I feel like my muscles are shrinking. I've begun a vitamin regime including coQ10. Now there's lots of bad news on statins. I don't want a heart attack or stroke but I'm afraid of the other potential side effects. What will maintain my heart and arteries without the side effects of statins. My fathers side of the family died of heart problems. Dad was 54. My sister had a quadruple bypass at about 60. Dad died at 54  My sis just died at 76. So far I've missed the bullet and have been a smoker. How much coenzyme 10 should I take?  I feel I MUST need it.

My wife_ age 66_ started and stopped at same time for same reasons. I play with large golf group (46 men_ same approx age group) most of whom take or tried these statins. Well over half have had to stop taking the drugs or stop playing golf.  Nearly all say their doctors are in denial about the problems (money related?. These drugs are a diabolic solution to a minor problem in most cases and cause problems way out of proportion to their benefits. Many have added drugs to cure (symptoms)_ these drugs also causing problems.  Don't take or_ if you do_ stop taking at earliest bad indications because many of the problems are severe and don't reverse entirely when the drug is discontined. I'm very active_ slim_ trim_normally with no health problems when not on these statins.

Felt like I was hit by a truck. Had to roll on to floor to get out of bed. Because I had had lesser muscle pain in legs after 2 other statins_ assumed it would go away in a week or so after stopping. Stopped Pravastatin but effects subsided only slowly and were still severe and disabling. Doctor refused to admit it was caused by the drug. I had pain and fatigue that leveled out but did not go away. It was hard to hold down a job and take care of my home but I had no choice_ so have had little life for 2 years.

It has taken 2 years and a long course of prednesone to get over it_ but I am starting to feel normal. The prednisone helped but had its own problems.,This definitely did more harm than any good it could have done. I will never be a healthy as I was.

I do not know if I can ever get back to the person i was. My new doctor wants me to take Zetia_ but I am afraid. I am taking Rx Omega 3 now. I am just starting to get my life back.

Initially I was put on Mevicor. Mevicor raised my liver enzymes_ so insted_ I was given 20 mg Pravachol once a day_ along with Gemfibrozil (Lopid) 600mg twice a day. This seemed to be a good combination. I have not noticed any side effects in 13 years. Recently because it worked so well for my sister_ I tried Lipitor. The liver enzymes bumped up so high that the doctor told me to stop everything for 6 weeks. Now I am taking 40mg of Pravachol a day along with the Gemfibrozil_ with improved results over the 20mg Pravochol. I do watch my diet carefully and am fairly active.

138, 2, chol/tri,as an addendum to what I wrote a few minutes ago; I took the 40 mg before bed. No other medication has put my lights out so quickly as pravachol. It goes beyond ambien and other sedatives I have also taken. I used to take 30 mg at night of remeron_ which at that dose will make you eat yourself out of house and home_ which is how I gained this volluptous body anyhow which caused me to HAVE to take the medicine. I have now gone down to 15 mg of remeron ih hopes to ingest less foot. So far...it waxes and wanes... (not to mention 5 mg diazapam_ and other meds during the day_ including Kadian_ Vicodin_ a trial on baclofen),I really think the bottom line is diet and exercise. I have been physically limited for a 2 1/2 years_ and food is a comfort_ yet I am more painfully aware of the additional wear and tear of the body with extra weight_ especially if the body is compromized_ but if your are open to getting the best out of life_ I think there are less harmful ways than pharmacha-illogically. I am still curious about the theory that is takes the extra fat and stores it in the abdomen. Plausible?

I improved over 2 weeks but as soon as I took a few more tablets the cycle started again.  In early August of 2004 my doctor thought it would be good to try Pravachol so started a 20mg dose to see how I tolerated it.  I have not been taking the higher 80mg dose as I wanted to pass the 6 month trial period I gave myself to see how things went.  Well_ it is not satisfactory so will drop the medication.
