0, 1, Peptic Ulcer,Axienty_ heart pain_ chest wierd feeling. Every time take the drug feeling like heart want to stop beating. Strange feeling in head_ hard to focus while driving_ talking and in crowded. Just take magnesium trisilicate to help the pain.,Stop taking this drug. Some doctors they never ever feel this pain of side effect. So they talk shit when we complaining.,M,30,2  days150,6/4/2016Email,Ranitidine

2, 3, Heartburn,nausea a little bit at first_ later none,I took it for a month. It didn't work. After I quitted my job_ I took it again_ my heartburn was getting better_ from 4-5 times heartburn a day to 2-3 times a day. But I took antibiotic for some reason and I got allergy. So_ I stopped the ranitidine again. Now I use Blendtac to blend a whole piece of ginger with water. Keep it in the fridge. Pour some_ add water and boil it (it's hot n spicy). Drink it in the morning and night before bed. I don't have heartburn the whole day.,F,40,40  days300 mg 1X D,9/21/2012,Ranitidine
3, 1, GERD,I was OK using 75mgs of this drug once a day but have had to increase it over the past 6 weeks to 150mg+ per day as GERD worse.  Now night sweats_ chills MUCH worse and horrid `lump in throat sensation' all of the time - also drug has ceased to wrok well and casues severe burning after taking it (in throat area and chest pain - which is very slow to abate).  I am stopping this drug and using Gaviscon for awhile as I feel it has done some damage now - with such long term and medically approved useage.,I `trusted' to help GERD but am convinced that it has done more damage than good as my digestive system seems to have gone haywire nd I feel quite unwell after using it now.,F,58,2  years150 1X D,5/2/2011Email,Ranitidine

5, 2, ulcer,anxiety_ muscle pain,was given 150mg twice daily but the side effects noted were so strong I have reduced it to 150mg once a day. still feeling the effects though not as bad. the anxiety is the worse for me. i do have anti-anxiety drugs but I don't want to have to take them just because of this medication_ so I'm not taking this after today. not worth the trouble. not a medication I would recommend at this point.,F,39,2  days,2/5/2009,Ranitidine
6, 5, GERD/Acid reflux,Nausea after prolonged usage,I have been taking Ranitidine (or generic Zantac if you may) since 2000 and thus far it's been the only thing besides Prevacid that keeps my GERD under control. However_ if I take it for a few days or so straight_ I start suffering with nausea and have to quit taking it.,M,26,8  years,3/11/2008,Ranitidine
