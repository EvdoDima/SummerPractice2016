0, 5, High blood pressure,Not so sure it is related to exforge but the past few months my gums  are looser even with regular brushing and the past 2 days the ankles have been swelling. I also take Bystolic 10 mg & recently added Montelukast for allergy & 1200 units of calcium as recommend by my doctor to ward off any bone loss due to aging_ have put on weight that I can't seem to lose...even thought I walk 2 miles every single stinking day .  I'm hoping these symptoms are not related since Exforge was the only med that worked & does not make me cough.,,F,59,7  years320,5/8/2015Email,Exforge
1, 1, high blood pressure,Swollen feet_ ankles_ and legs continue a month after gettting offthe drug for bad side effects.,Exforge is a dangerous drug and should be taken off the market.,M,81, 10/160 1X D,4/5/2014,Exforge
2, 3, HBP,It controls my bp pretty well ( better than other drugs I have tried). Weight gain (and cannot lose any weight after being on it for over a year). Swelling in ankles_ seems to go away overnight and starts again next day.  Tingling in fingers_ toes_ and feet.  I have not stopped taking it yet but probably will soon.  Just hope I can find something else that will work. Every Bp med I have taken has caused swelling of my ankles and legs.,,F,35,1  years150,1/24/2014,Exforge

6, 2, Hypertension,About two weeks after starting this medication_ I noticed pronounced swelling in my feet and ankles. The swelling would start happening a couple of hours after taking the tablet_ and would usually subside in the evening or overnight_ only to occur again the next day. Initially I didn't realise it was a side effect_ and wondered if it was due to a foot injury (I had been exercising a lot). Decided to stop taking Exforge_ and the swelling stopped happening immediately. However_ around the same time I began to notice some numbness in my toes and fingertips_ and changed sensations mainly in the soles of my feet and palms of my hands_ but also progressing up my legs and arms to some degree. The sensation is one of increased sensitivity_ which makes walking unpleasant and also touching things with my hands. My GP says it is a peripheral nerve problem_ but not damage_ which should resolve after a few weeks. I'm not so sure. I have read that Exforge can caue peripheral nerve damage_ and am con,Be very careful with this medication. I suffered two significant side effects from different ingredients in the tablet. If you notice any of these effects_ especially any peripheral nerve problems_ I think it would be best to stop taking the tablets immediately and contact your GP ASAP.,M,56,5  weeks5/160mg 1X D,12/17/2011Email,Exforge
