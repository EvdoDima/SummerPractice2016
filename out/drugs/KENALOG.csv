My hands would shake_ I could not keep them still. Numbness in feet,Finally my PCP checked my B-12 level. It was very low. Kenalog will cause your B-12 to drop_ drastically. If you are experiencing nervous system dysfunction after having epidural injection of Kenalog_ have B-12 checked.

None of my clothing fit and I have been unable to wear any of my clothing; can only wear sweat pants and no bra.

I can only wear the 3 sizes too big bra for about an hour without severe chest/back pain from the binding effect.

Have endured numerous blood,I was not given the option of an informed consent; I did consent to it -they did ask me but never informed me of the possible side effects_ which are all over the net if one simply looks.  In my opinion_ it should be removed from all formularies.

11, 1, Allergies,I was given this shot by my doctor to treat allergies and wasn't told of the side effects_ or that it was a steriod. I would not recommend this drug. I would advise anyone thinking of getting this shot to research before doing so. There are plenty of side effects and I don't think they are worth it. Every since having this shot_ I've had difficulty sleeping_ fatigue_ muscle weakness_ mood swings_ confusion_ depression_ irritability_ dizziness on and off_ light headed_ itchiness_ flushing_ tingling in arms and legs.

12, 1, injections for spinal nerve pain,After an epidural to my lumbar spine: severe pain_ burning pain_ jolts of shooting pain_ constant aching pain_ weakness_ rapid heartbeat_ dizziness.  The next day_ I had a an extremely severe jolt of shooting nerve pain that was like a lightning bolt inside my body  I saw a flash of white light and almost fell down. I was terribly disoriented_ could hardly walk. Any activity immediately triggered nerve pain that traveled throughout my entire body_ especially the lower body.  Tingling_ spasm_ weakness.,EVERY TIME I have had a steroid shot for my spine_ no matter what typeepidural_ block_ trigger point injectionsI have had NO relief and the horrible_ severe symptoms I described here. Extremely severe pain and spasm continued for MONTHS_ along with severe side effects_ including weight gain_ insomnia_ weakness and horrible spasm_ rash_ flushing_ and anxietyalthough with all that going on_ how else could one feel?  Every doctor has denied that Kenalog would do this.  I think they know very well what steroids do. How could they not? By the way_ if you HAVE to have a steroid injection_ take an antihistamine. That will stop some of the side effects.,F,67,5  times 1X D,12/15/2012,Kenalog

14, 1, Allergies,Had a Kenalog injection in my upper arm in August to relieve seasonal allergies_ as prescribed by my doctor.  A little over 2 months later I notice an indentation just underneath my shoulder.  After researching symptoms_ I have finally put the two together. I am extremely upset that I was never told of this side effect!  I have read that the indent may get larger....and I am afraid of future side effects from this drug.

15, 1, misdiagnosis of spine impingement,Pain in all extremities 6 months since injections. Pain began immediately following injections and was never experienced before injections. Consulted with many doctors who either flatly denied any connection to Kenalog (according to them_ there are no lasting side effects) or are clueless about side effects (it appears they are unfamiliar with the drug's package insert material).,Look up article Understanding Potential Complications Of Epidural Steroid Injections: Practitioners need to understand and educate their patients regarding the full scope of potential side effects that can occur when receiving epidural steroids by two highly respected pain specialists at the Keck School of Medicine_ University of Southern California. The article states in part: Despite the indisputable rise in the number of pain interventions_ little has been written about the potential side effects of administering steroids into the epidural space. In fact_ many premier textbooks allocate only a couple of pages to exploring glucocorticoid mechanism of action and then only briefly mention potential side effects. This lack of understanding has led many practitioners to naïvely view steroids as benign drugs without fully comprehending the broad scope of potential side effects that can occur when steroids are injected into the epidural space. Undoubtedly_ adverse effects from epidural steroid injections are not usually lethal_ but they can carry significant morbidity and may be very disconcerting to patients. To understand the full scope of complications that can arise from epidural administration of glucocorticoids_ it is necessary not only to understand the technical/mechanical complications that occur with needle placement_ but also to grasp the role of pharmacokinetics_ steroid particulate size_ and_ most importantly_ how glucocorticoids affect near,F,44,6  weeks200 4X O,7/31/2012Email,Kenalog

17, 5, keiloids,I get an injection every six weeks and I am very happy with the results. I have very sensitive skin so my bra strap caused keiloids on my shoulders. They became big lumps and darkened my skin. Most people mentioned about a dent in the area of injection. Well_ this is what you want to happen with keiloids. You want them to shrink and it also brings back the natural color. Once those big_ dark lumps are flattened I will quit with the injections. I have noticed some irregular bleeding that mimics my cycle. Most of the time it's just spotting but it basically goes on throughout the month! However_ I expect to have only 1 more injection and I will be happy with my shoulders and my cycle should return to normal.,,F,28,4  months 1X M,5/24/2010,Kenalog
18, 1, Shoulder pain,Drug nearly killed me.

19, 5, Poison Ivy,none,This was a generic form of what kenalog is that i was taking. I have severe poison ivy allergy.  This was on my hand. My fingers were swollen to twice their normal circumference and very blistered. The cream worked within 24 hours after applying. The swelling went down and the itching was gone.  Did not have to use a lot of it either. Used less than what was directed on the bottle.  Remember you own your body.  Research and understand all that you can about anything that ails you. Know and understand anything given to you to relieve that ailment.,M,39,2  weeks,8/2/2008,Kenalog

21, 1, for hip pain,I didn't feel like kenalog helped with my hip pain.  The worst thing_ though_ was that after a couple of months I noticed a large dent in my hip.  So_ the only thing that drug did was kill my muscle tissue.  I'm 5 ft. 3 in. and weigh 110 pounds--I need all the muscle and fat tissue I have_ especially around the hip area.,I never would have agreed to a shot of Kenalog if I had known what it would do to my hip.  No doctor can tell me how to get the muscle tissue built up again.,F,58,1  days,2/17/2007,Kenalog
