0, 5, Birth Control_ Regulate Periods,None.,I have tried many birth control pills some of which worked well before I had a baby and some that work better for me now that I have a kiddo.  So far I really like this pill.  My periods are short and almost nonexistent.  I don't think I have experienced any weight gain_ nor do I think BC is tied to weight gain.  I think there is a decrease in libido_ but it is to be expected when on birth control_ any birth control.  This has been a great pill for me.  I would recommend it to friends and family.,F,32,6  months 1X D,4/2/2011Email,Junel 1.5/30
