2, 4, Thalamatic Pain Syndrome,Itching,I've read all of everyone's comments too bad no knows the complete medical history of those that are having such adverse affects or unfortunately blaming a drug for suicide.  As a Christian and someone who underwent a 23 1/2 hour brain surgery that I only had a 10% chance of living and I was never supposed to walk or see and other things.  I am very satisfied that I can walk kind of funny to watch but I can.  I'm now a grandfather and even though I may have to do things differently than others it doesn't bother me.  I do live in constant pain because of TPS but I take Dilaudid  and as long as I don't abuse it and don't play the old wo-is-me mind games I'm fine.  My surgery was done when I was in the U.S.Marines  for 14 years I was 29 years old when this happened and I'm now 59.,M,59,1.5  years8mg 5X D,1/22/2016Email,Dilaudid-hp

The nurse left the room so I couldn't ask her if that was normal reaction and I didn't have a call button so I waited for her to come back. I didn't get to ask her. I came to a few hours later and nurse was doing something next to my bed and she said_ ""ah your awake_ you scared us_ you turned blue and wouldn't wake up and something about having to almost being intubated"" and I then put my hands to my face and yup I had the oxygen mask on and saw some kind of gadget on bed. I asked at some point if I was allergic and she said NO just sensative. That stuff will put an elephant down! I guess it made my blood pressure drop really really low. I surely don't want that drug again EVER!

21, 5, Damage of S1 nerve root (back),constipation (I use Miralax and Colace with great success),I was a prisoner to chronic pain. I have many medication allergies including Percocet and Morphine. I took Tylenol w/Codeine for 3 years. After my Physician convinced me to try Dilaudid I wouldn't go back to anything else. After stopping the Codeine I realized how much GI distress it caused along with headaches.  I have no side effects and my pain is manageable.  I am also an RN (that's how I injured my back)and was afraid because Dilaudid is a major narcotic_ but it works for me without causing any drowsiness or sedation.

Dilaudid did fantastic job of relieving pain.  after the hand injury I was perscribed it in a lowed dose for my back pain from an injury 10 years earlier.  I stopped taking Dilaudid because of the side effects specifically the depression with the head ache a close second.

26, 1, post bilateral mastectomy,Insane itching on my trunk then all over_ from my scalp to my toes. The itch felt like it was on the inside of my body so nothing helped it. I had small waves of some type of numbness from my head down my face. That did not hurt_ it was just a strange sensation. All this ended when they took me off of it.,I was on the pump. I woke up in recovery in severe pain. Further doses over the next few days didn't really seem to help the pain. I was switched to another drug after they realized I was having a bad reaction to the Dilaudid. For me_ the newer drug worked much better.,F,49,3  days,11/4/2008,Dilaudid-hp

NEEDLESS to say_ she put it in my IV and i woke up some time later in my room. i was tucked in my bed.... and out of pain.  when it wore off they began a regimen of 20MG oxiconting (time releaseed) every 12 hours: 2- 10 mg lortab every 4 hours: and 2 5mg oxycodone every other 4 hours when i wasnt taking the lortabs.

30, 5, Severe GI tract Pain,withdraw effects after being off it.,"This was given to me through an IV at the hospital for 5 days. It worked wonderfully.  Your body/brain does need to be opiate tolerant to handle narcotics though. This is a potent analgesic. The only bad thing_ as with any narcotic_ is the withdraw.  That cleared up in a few days though and consisted of mainly a ""wanting or needing"" the drug after I was home.",M,39,5  days,8/2/2008,Dilaudid-hp

I got a little light-headed at first but nothing bad. After we left the hospital to get my crutches I started sweating profusely and dry-heaving. I couldn't talk well and we had to pull over multiple times because I thought I was going to throw up. I was very disoriented and it took a good 30-45 minutes for it to pass.

On Tuesday morning I begin to have a hard time breathing (felt like I could not get a good breath).  During physical therapy (I had just used the PCA prior to Physical therapy coming to my room) I had a very hard time breathing.  Around 4:30 that evening I was experiencing surgical pain and used my PCA again_ within 10 minutes I could not breath at all_ gasping for breath.  They increased my oxygen and put a humidifier on the oxygen and gave me a shot of morphine.  The last episode occurred around 7:30.  I was again experiencing surgical pain and pressed the PCA on recommendation of my nurse.  Again_ with 5-10 minutes I began to experience the same thing again.  I could feel it coming on this time.  I could not get a breath at all_ it was like my throat had completed closed up.  They removed my PCA and gave me a breathing treatment. Eventually,F,63,2  days,11/23/2007,Dilaudid-hp
