0, 5, Insomnia,None,I have tried several medications for my severe insomnia and all have had severe side effects.  Miltown is very old and not often prescribed any longer which is sad as patients do not have to suffer to get the required results. It has helped to restore my sleep tremendously which has helped my quality of life.,F,50,20  days200 MG 1X D,7/20/2012,Miltown
1, 5, ,No side effects.  I use it to help me sleep.  Felt wide awake in the morning with no side effects. Works beautifully as a sleep aid.  Can be addictive_ so I am careful to take it only when I need help sleeping (about twice a week).,This medication is rarely prescribed any longer; I don't know why because there are so few_ if any_ unwanted side effects_ especially at night_ which is the only time I take it. It can be addictive if abused; maybe that's why it isn't prescribed as much.  It has been a real help for me in sleeping.,F,62,12  months200 mg 1X D,7/5/2012,Miltown
