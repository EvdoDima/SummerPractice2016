0, 4, Mania / Hypomania,After a few days my head gets foggy and I seem to miss words in sentences or mix things up.I only take it for short term so it's all right.Overheating too.,"It's not like the new anti-psychotics which take you slowly down_ for me it's like hitting a wall. I like that better. It's shorter_ less painful and I can get off it all right.I tried the more recent but they are a pain because you must wait for them to kick in.The first time I had loxapine it knocked me out straight. After 5 days or so my bones kind of turn to cement and it's really painful.So I don't take it on a long term_ just as a stop!Those are MY symptoms and MY experience but maybe you'll get something different.It's an old anti-psychotic...I've been ""on"" it since 2006. Now i'm relying on it when needed. So I put down 3 years of usage even though not continuous.",F,25,3  years,11/24/2009,Loxapine succinate
