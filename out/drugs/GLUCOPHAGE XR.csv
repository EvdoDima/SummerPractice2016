1, 5, Insulin Resistance,In the beginning_ diarrhea_ bloating and headaches. Now_ no side effects!,I wrote a previous rating dated 4/17/2015. My side effects are gone. My C-peptide levels went from 14.7 down to 5.3; still a little high but doctor is considering increasing the metformin at my follow up visit in August. I have lost 37 pounds since February_ have very little to no cravings for carbs. I do not count calories so my weight loss has been solely due to decrease in carb intake. I have had 2-3 hypoglycemic episodes since starting this medicine in February---that is down from 2-3 episodes a week! The times I have had the episodes have been when I have forgotten to eat_ so make sure you eat on time. I have been very pleased with this medicine.,F,47,5  months1000 1X D,7/29/2015,Glucophage xr
2, 4, insulin resistance,Diarrhea and strong bad smell of urine.,It helps losing some weight and re-organizing the sugars and carbs in your body but it causes diarrhea and strong bad smell of urine.,M,16,2  years750 xr,7/28/2015,Glucophage xr

4, 5, Insulin Resistance,Stomach ache_ headache_ bloating/diarrhea if eating high carb food.,Stomach aches lasted a few weeks but eventually went away. I am still having headaches but a friend who is also on it said to hang in there_ her headaches went away after a couple of months. The severity has decreased. I have no clue how this is affecting my C-Peptide as my next lab isn't scheduled until July---however_ HUGE diminish in carb craving. I get bloated/diarrhea anytime I eat anything with a high carb load. My body just does not crave the carbs like before so that has not been a big issue.  Without even dieting_ I have lost about 18 pounds in the past nine weeks. Time will tell if that will continue. I have heard there is more of a weight loss on the regular tabs but the side effects are much worse (esp. diarrhea),F,47,9  weeks1000 MG 1X D,4/17/2015,Glucophage xr
5, 1, Diabetes 2,Seemed like I tolerated it well. Started becoming emotional_ lethargic and noticed_ that my pulse rate seemed to he going up_ along with my blood pressure. Not drastic_ but being on atenolol for years I was used to a pulse of 55 or 69. Now it was running 70 and 80. Last week I ended up in ER with pulse of 132 !and blood pressure of 171/121. After X-rays_ EKG_ blood and urine tests they determined everything was fine and due to my symptoms(inner shaking and feeling 0f weakness) that it was a side effect of metformin and told me to stop taking it. Moved on to lantus. One week later I am full of energy_ have my zest for life back and my pulse is around 55 along with my blood pressure at 105/65! Very sneaky side effects! Oh_ and my taste and smell came back as well! Everything tasted like card board!',,F,52,5  months2000,3/16/2015,Glucophage xr

Also didn't cause any weight loss_ darn it.,Inexpensive as generic Metformin on my Medicare Part D supplement_ $3 for 90 days supply.  It works.  It's inexpensive.

13, 3, Type 2 Diabetes,Diarrhea the first 2 days. Some bloating. Now I'm dizzy_ shaky_ cold_ rubbery legs_feeling weak_ cold hands.,Been on this a month and still feel bed. Rubbery legs and weak all over. I thought it was false hypo. Blood sugars are fine. (98-110) Went back to the doc who told me to add more carbs. Didn't help. I was on low-carb (30 carbs/day) and lost a lot of weight that I couldn't afford to lose. I feel useless around the house. No strength at all. Not sleeping much at all. Been back to the doc twice. Ran blood tests. Nothing wrong. I think I have some weird allergy to Metformin. Going to try another manufacturer to see if that makes a difference. I start to feel a lot better 1-2 hrs. before it's time to take it again. Seriously thinking about stopping it and trying to keep my blood glucose levels under control with diet. I can't exercise_ because I'm too weak. Get winded and shaky just walking to the mailbox.Been 3 weeks and symptoms are not improving. is there anyone else out there that felt like this and had it finally go away? I'd be willing to stay on it_ if I thought I would eventually start to feel better.,F,64,30  days500 MG 1X D,3/12/2012Email,Glucophage xr
14, 4, PCOS,Started drug 2 different times.  Both times the first 2 weeks are horrible.  Feeling like I want to throw up_ but never do.  HORRIBLE liquid stool_ lasting the entire 2 weeks while I get adjusted to it.  Can't eat or drink ANYTHING without having to use the bathroom.,The adjustment period of this drug is HORRIBLE!  It's like the worst flu in the world times 1_000.  Once it was in my body_ and my body accepted it_ it gave me my life back.  I had no menses for almost 2 years the first time I took this_ and within 10 days_ my cycle was regular again.  I went off it after about a year or two because I had to take 4 pills a day_ and it became frustrating.  My period became abnormal again_ so again_ I am starting it_ and I am feeling HORRIBLE again.  100 percent liquid stool_ can't eat or drink_ or leave the house_ or do ANYTHING.  I am staying positive though_ because I know the bad will go away_ and I will have my life back within a short time.  Anyone who has to take this drug_ stick with it through the hard times_ because it really does do what it says...for PCOS it also minimizes hair loss on the head and hair growth in the wrong areas.  Great drug!!,F,31,6  years2000 MG 1X D,3/7/2012Email,Glucophage xr
15, 4, PCOS,diarrhea during adjustment period_ weight loss_ low blood sugar when I forget to eat regularly.,I have been on and off this medication for several years due to insurance issues. when I am on it_ I am satisfied with the results. During the first 2 weeks or so_ I've suffered from almost liquid stools from this medication_ but it corrected itself as my body had adjusted for the most part_ however_ this side effect will present itself when I have a fatty meal or a meal high in dairy. Also_ I have to eat on a schedule when I'm on this medication_ because I have had symptoms of low blood sugar when I go too long between meals when this wasn't a problem before. I also have far fewer side effects then I did when I was on the regular version. The XR version is a life saver for me. On the non XR version I had liquid stools for months on end_ and was stuck in the bathroom 10x a day.,F,26,3  years750 1X D,10/29/2011Email,Glucophage xr
16, 5, Type 2 Diabetes,Flatulence and possible hair thinning.  Diarrhea symptoms disappeared after a few days of using the drug.,My A1C is now at 5.7.  I can eat whatever I like and it doesn't seem to raise my A1C.  Glucophage XR is a miracle worker.,M,41,1  years1000 2X D,10/13/2011,Glucophage xr
17, 4, Type II Diabetes,None that I'm certain of_ but it may be causing GERD or agravating an existing condition.,Very inexpensive at WalMart and keeps me in the 120 range on my meter,M,64,3  years500mg 1X D,1/15/2011,Glucophage xr
18, 4, Type II Diabetes,Slightly softer stools.,"I truly wonder if most of the commenters here are writing about the correct drug.Regular glucophage causes diarrhea in many people_ but Glucophage XR (extended release) usually doesn't.  Once I was taken off regular glucophage and onto XR I could leave the house with confidence again! :-) You may have to haggle with your insurance company (which will want to put you on a ""generic glucophage"" which isn't time-released) but if regular glucophage gives you ""the trots"" your doc can write the script as ""medically necessary"".  This is what I had to do to stay on this drug which works quite well.Over the years I have had to add 45 mgs of Actos 1/day_ and Byetta_ but I am doing very well_ feel good_ and have good glucose control - and I am not overweight.",F,50,14  years1000 mgs 2X D,10/12/2010,Glucophage xr
19, 2, polycystic ovarian syndrome,horrible diarrhea every other day or so_ stomach PAIN_ light headedness_ dislike for favorite foods_ strange cravings_ shakiness_ extreme hunger pangs_ very bad gas,"I am 5'5"" and 125 pounds...I don't need to lose weight and I don't have diabetes.  But I do have terrible PCOS and endo.  My period is more regular_ but I don't think it's worth it.   I couldn't tolerate the regular metformin_ so my RE switched me to this.  After 45 days_ still terrible!  Does it get better?  I'm about to call it quits on this med.  I am sick of being sick.",F,35,45  days750mg 2X D,6/3/2010Email,Glucophage xr

25, 4, PCOS/ Pre-diabetes,This has been much better than the regular metformin.  I take one 500mg at night.  Once in a while I may experience stomach pain_ but usually not.  I have to be careful about dairy products when I take this med.  I have not been real consistent with taking the pill_ but when I am_ it regulates my period.  I have not had hair loss_ or bad digestive problems.  I may have lost some weight_ but I do  not take this every day like I should.,I am going to start back on this and take it daily (nightly actually).  It does help regulate my periods and glucose levels.,F,40,1  years,12/6/2008,Glucophage xr

Now that I've been on the medication for a few months_ I have noticed that I don't poop for about two days with uncomfortable bloating.,I have been taking Metformin XR for approximately two months for PCOS. I take 500 mg in the morning with breastfast and 500 mg in the evening with dinner. I noticed within a few days of starting this medication that the visable swelling and discomfort in my legs (cankles) had decreased significantly. I have not lost any weight with this medication as of yet_ but will talk with my Endo regarding possibly increasing my dosage. FYI: I also take Synthroid 100mg (hypothyroidism)_ Orthro Tri-Cyclen Lo (PCOS & bc)_ Effexor XR 75 mg (anxiety/depression)_ and Spironolactone 50 mg - one in morning and one in evening (PCOS). I have heard that taking the Spironolactone with Metformin XR had good results with PCOS patients.

I started out at 500mg and now 6 months later taking 2000mg - I have lost 20 lbs - however I do exercise - lightly_ cut down on my sugar and carb intake and lowered my total caloric intake.  20 lbs in 6 mos is not alot - but I feel better and eating better - I also noticed my bodys water weight is less - I am less swollen all over - holding less water eventhought I am drinking more than enough every day.   Hope my post helps.  I am currently under docs care for In Vitro - Doc told me to stay on this Medication so I will do.  I do get bloating and mild stomach discomfort - I just drink water and poop then I feel so much better - however_ I do have IBS so its understandable how I differ from the rest of the comments out here - having IBS w/constipation - this Glucophage really helps me all over.,Great Medication for me with few irritations.,F,35,6  months,5/11/2007,Glucophage xr
36, 3, Insulin Resistance_ PCOS_ fertility,gas_ bloating_ stomach pains,I originally started on the regular Glucophage and had horrible side effects of gas_ bloating_ and stomach pains.

I have been getting my period more regularly_ but only recently.  I also am on medication for Lupus_ although my Dr. said that should not interfere.
