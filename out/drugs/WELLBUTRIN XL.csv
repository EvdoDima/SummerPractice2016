1, 1, Depression,Tinnitis_ aggression_ high blood pressure_ mania_ fatigue_ decreased inhibitions_ increased pleasure seeking_ but worst of all_ withdrawal of treatment caused DPDR disorder.,"Wellbutrin seemed to help me at first. I was confident_ headstrong_ and motivated. I didn't see it at first_ but this was because of my new aggressive behavior. I stood up for myself when challenged. I had an ""alpha"" mentality. I made a lot of life changes that I had been afraid to initiate. I was fearless. However....this came at a price. I was mean. People were afraid to confront me. I started to get tired some time after increasing my dosage to 300mg daily. So_ I started to taper off the drug. I don't know what wellbutrin did to me_ but I had a serious case of depersonalization-derealization disorder for a whole year after coming off of it. It was a nightmare. The worst year of my life. I didn't feel like myself again until I started Adderall after a year and regained some cognitive function and sense of self.",M,27,4  months150 mg 1X D,5/9/2016Email,Wellbutrin xl
2, 1, Anxiety_ weight loss_ stop smoking,Racing heart rate_ anxiety_ tremor_ paranoia_ loss of appetite_ hot flashes.,I only took this for 3 days. The symptoms were so bad that I stopped. Everyone says to give it 2 weeks for the symptoms to pass but I couldn't do it. Doc prescribed to me mainly for weight loss and quitting smoking. They definitely do curb your appetite_ in fact_ you have no desire to eat which can be dangerous. I had to force feed myself and I could barely take a couple bites. I still had the urge to smoke so that didn't help_ and I can't say it helped with anxiety because the pharmacist said it would take a month to be fully effective. The tremor it gave me was awful. My finger and hand constantly shook and I felt like I had no strength in my arms and hands.,F,34,3  days150mg,5/8/2016,Wellbutrin xl

5, 5, Depression,"At the time I started taking Wellbutrin XL I was taking Prozac but felt I needed a little ""boost"". Psych Dr. added the Wellbutrin XL. I lost 5 to 10 pounds initially and found I wasn't ""grazing"" all day. Eventually weaned off the Prozac and have continued with the Wellbutrin XL.",My insurance company_ UHC_ refused to continue paying for the name brand as of January 2016. My Dr. will not prescribe the generic nor would I take it if he did. As someone else suggested_ Google the generic. What I've read is pretty frightening and the FDA is irresponsible in their decision to give drug companies the OK to continue providing these useless generics to unsuspecting patients. Direct Success Pharmacy works with the provider of the name brand. It's a very easy process to get the name brand through this avenue. Some patients may not have to pay for the drug while others pay 50 dollars for a months supply. Your Dr. can write a script for up to three months at a time. For what I pay in insurance premiums every month_ it's pretty crappy that insurers are allowed to make these decisions for subscribers. It's happening more and more unfortunately and with most insurers.,F,55,15  years300 mg 1X D,3/20/2016,Wellbutrin xl
6, 2, Depression_,,I switched from CELEXA (40mg) to Wellbutrin XL about 3 weeks ago. So far it has been really hard getting through the days. I slept the whole weekend because I was severely depressed. I have had 2 major fights with my boyfriend and have been easily irritated by people at work. I am usually a doormat that never stands up for myself; however on Wellbutrin XL I am a lion looking prey on anyone that gets in my way. Celexa caused me to gain about 45lbs over the course of a year and a half. Even with excessive exercise and dieting_ I was never able to lose even an ounce of weight. I started Wellbutrin because of the reviews I saw online for it. I wanted a drug that would not cause me to gain weight. I am hoping things get a lot better over time. I am hanging in there only because some people have stated that it gets worse before it ever get better. I am going to increase my dosage to 300mg ( request the psychiatrist to do so) and see what happens. I really want this drug to work for me. I was skinny and now I am obese and depressed. UPDATE: It has been exactly 1 month that I have been on wellbutrin.  I am taking the generic brand made by Global Pharmaceuticals.  I am experiencing a little bit of the appetite lose.  Yesterday I went the entire day without eating.  I began to feel hungry around 6pm last night.  I have just increased my dosage to 450mg per day.  I have been taking this dosage for 2 days.

I no longer binge eat/have the desire too which was a huge problem before. I don't have the urge to way myself multiple times a day like before and I hardly weigh myself now (once a week). I am also attending cognitive therapy to learn how to help myself. Whatever you do know there is help and that you can't go through life alone. You owe it yourself to be happy. I wish you the best and things WILL get better. I know it for a fact I was very suicidal for a few years and had no hope all it took was hope and medication to start my recovery process.,F,21,2  months150 mg,1/9/2016,Wellbutrin xl

If you are going to take Wellbutrin_ I HIGHLY recommend ONLY taking the brand name. There are known issues with the generics (Google and see for yourself).

10, 5, MDD_ digestion failing,Increased libido_ minor muscle twitching in upper extremities_ magnified emotional responses temporarily_ minor decreased typing proficiency.,Though started for Major Depression almost 2.5 years ago_ it fixed my concern I would slowly starve to death by restoring effectiveness of my digestive system to about 95% or better of what it had been up till 8 years ago when it slowly began to decline. After three months I had to add a second antidepressant to control depression_ but none of the others keeps my digestive system working like Wellbutrin.

11, 3, PTSD - major depression,Slight humming or ringing in my earsVision problems,Wellbutrin is about the only prescription drug I could tolerate without numerous side effects. I can't use SSRI's etc. Lately though my eyesight is becoming increasingly troublesome. I have developed cataracts and of course my age plays a part in this too. But I now have blurred vision_ sometimes double vision and pain in my left eye. My blood pressure has also increased. I also take Xanax and Ambien as needed. Have no idea what to try next but the vision problems are really scaring me.,F,66,3  years150 MG 1X D,12/7/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
12, 5, Depression_ ADD_ Anxiety,Jittery at first_ insomnia_ brain fog,I never thought I could take Wellbutrin because of anxiety but doctor asked me to stay on it at least six weeks. To my surprise the anxiety faded away_ and the insomnia turned into drowsiness so that now I take it at night. Please don't take the negative reviews to heart and give it at least 8 weeks before you decide (unless doc says otherwise.) I tried it once before and gave up too soon. I think my life would have been more productive in the meanwhile if I'd have stayed with it. Have lost weight and only persistent side effect is mild brain fog/memory issue_ but that is improving by the week. I am so glad I stuck with it.,F,55,4  months300 mg 1X D,11/30/2015,Wellbutrin xl

14, 5, Depression,When I started I had severe headaches for the first seven weeks.  At week 7 the headaches subsided and have never had any more side effects,I have been taking brand Wellbutrin for 30 years and it has been a life saver.  When the generic came out my pharmacist changed me from brand to generic and my depression symptoms returned.  I called my doctor and he said what took you so long to realize.  He said many of his patients were having similar problems.  All these years my insurance supplied me with the brand drug.  My drug plan notified me that January 1st they will no longer supply me with the brand name.  If I want the brand name it will cost me thousands of dollars.  I do not understand how a drug plan has the authority to switch a person to generic when the generic does not work.All antidepressants work for me but they all make me physically ill.  Wellbutrin was the only drug that resolved my depression with no physical side effects.,M,70,10  years450 mg,11/5/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
15, 5, Binge Eating Disorder_ BDD,Weight decreased,I lost 30 pounds so far with Wellbutrin. I absolutely love it. I'm the thinnest I have ever been and am now very close to a normal body weight for my height. It gave me the willpower that I needed to fight binge eating. It requires some effort on your part_ but the medication is a great aide. The only problem is that it doesn't work for my BDD. That's easily fixed_ though_ because my psychiatrist has added a different antidepressant along with Wellbutrin. Overall_ great experience.,F,17,7  months300 MG 1X D,10/24/2015,Wellbutrin xl
16, 5, Depression,"None! Absolutely none. Not a single one. Nada. I started taking Wellbutrin XL for depression last Spring_ although I've probably needed it for several years -- if not decades. I have been terrified to start on the Dreaded Anti-Depressant my entire life!!! TV commercials listing every possible side effect_ knowing that it takes time for these things to ""work_"" but that the side effects are immediate_ knowing that it's not easy to wean off of these meds if they don't work and having to start over with a different med_ and possible weight gain (so common with these meds) have prevented me from even considering such an option. Boy_ was I wrong! I have experienced the OPPOSITE of side effects with Wellbutrin XL. It has ""fixed"" everything that was ""wrong"" with me -- and not just the depression! I think I can (and probably should) write a book about it because it has absolutely and unexpectedly REVERSED some very uncomfortable Multiple Sclerosis symptoms!! I've h","Bottom Line: I am no longer depressed_ I have *virtually* no MS symptoms anymore (just minor issues_ as I still do *have* the disease)_ I did NOT gain weight (just the opposite -- I think I lost a few pounds)_ and my libido has never been stronger. The nickname for Wellbutrin is the ""Happy_ Horny_ Skinny Pill."" I would add ""Healthy"" to that list_ and welcome any medical professionals who would like to study my situation to see if it can help others with their MS symptoms.",F,50,1.5  years150mg 1X D,10/21/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl

The only this is the insomnia is terrible so I'm about to start taking it in the morning and see how that works!! Regarding the dizziness it's very slight and maybe could even be because of lack of sleep?? This medicine has given more more energy_ helped me with my severe anxiety_ & make me feel happier and helped me mend relationships with my family.

18, 5, Severe depression,Increased anxiety for the first month_ out of body sensation for the first month_ dry mouth to this day. Slight weight loss (10lbs in 12months) and increased sex drive that hasn't wavered.,"Wellbutrin saved my life. After years of being fearful of taking antidepressants (I was worried I would lose myself) I finally caved after developing suicidal ideation and becoming fixated on death and obsessive negative thoughts. I can say it took my AT LEAST 8 weeks before I felt my depression subside_ but when it finally did_ it really did. I have never felt so ""normal"" in my life. I no longer am consumed with sadness and I no longer desire to seek out sadness. It's amazing!",F,23,1  years150 mg,9/21/2015,Wellbutrin xl
19, 5, Anxiety_ ADHD_ Depression,Irritability_ dry mouth,After cancer treatment anxiety kicked in which was affecting my business. Depression then set in because my business was suffering. My fiance a registered nurse was concerned and also she noticed I had signs and symptoms of ADHD and I was undiagnosed my entire life and it all made sense why I was always doing different things and could not sit still in school. When I started the med the first 3 days I was irritable and in a flat out rage screaming at people while I was driving and so forth. But then_ suddenly it went away and I have not had any anxiety or rage. My depression...gone. It helped my ADHD a great deal. I can concentrate and organize my thoughts which has made me more productive and able to focus on my business again. I have not been on this med for me but it is working and my only side effect is dry mouth but I need to drink more water anyway. I hope my experience helps you but remember everyone is different and talk to your doctor.,M,31,1  months,9/14/2015,Wellbutrin xl
20, 3, Depression,SHORT period of insomnia.  Exhaustion.  Excellent sex drive.,First_ the very good thing: I am much more interested in sex.  That was a big problem on Prozac.  Side effect wise_ I had insomnia for literally only like 2-3 days on 150mg.  Dosage raised to 300mg_ insomnia still did not return.  But my chief problem right now is being absolutely exhausted.  I have weened off 2mg Abilify and 60mg Prozac when starting this_ so my body might just be really confused right now.  But overall I'm disappointed because I thought Wellbutrin was going to make me not be fatigued_ be more energetic... I also seem to be gaining weight which I didn't expect. It's been two and a half weeks (sorry for writing a review so soon) so I hope in like another month everything will even out with the energy/motivation.,M,27,18  days300 mg 1X D,9/14/2015,Wellbutrin xl

22, 2, depression_ adhd,I had severe nerve pain in my hand when on Wellbutrin XL.  After exercising_ after eating_ when hot and especially when cold_ my thumb would throb and hurt until sometimes I couldn't do anything but rock back and forth until the pain subsided.  Several especially bad times_ I also felt the pain in the tip of my forefinger_ and sometimes the tip of my middle finger.,The pain was generally localized to under the back left corner of my thumbnail on the right hand.  The pain started a month after taking Wellbutrin_ and I asked all my doctors and they said it couldn't be caused by it.  Well_ after taking Wellbutrin for 2 years and during two surgeries to fix the thumb pain_ I've finished the Wellbutrin and the pain has significantly subsided.  The pain before was up to 6s and 7s (with 9 being splitting my head open in a car accident)_ the pain is currently reaching a 3 at max and mostly just 1s and 2s.  The pain now could just be all the scar tissue from the surgeries!  This is on the internet now so if others are looking they'll know it could happen!

23, 1, depression_ in a drug combo,I thought I was experiencing a dramatic shift towards menopause. I had 3 heavier periods in 2 months both with severe outbreaks of hormonal rosasea_nausea_extreme sweating-- ended up in the ER with dehydration_ irritability and a worsening hypersensitivity to sound; it did increase my libido_ but that wasn't enough of a perk. I just recently stopped taking it.,I'd been on wellbutrin about 12 years ago.

It's been working great_ I take it at night. Unlike most people is sedating. So I take it at night_  the dry mouth_  sleepiness is worth it to me. The other ones killed my libido and having been married a year and a half it was either suffer from SAD all winter or take this.  If you have issues with the generic is the time release mechanism. Read about the FDA recall it's not bogus. Something isn't right with generic Wellbutrin Xl. I pay fifty bucks out of pocket but it makes a difference.

26, 2, Depression,Dry mouth_ anxiety (only in the beginning)_ weight loss_ loss of appetite_ tinnitus_ dizziness_ worsening of migraines_ bad taste in mouth_ increased sex drive,This medication does make you lose weight; however_ this side effect eventually went away.  I was already at a healthy weight when I began using this medication_ and I let myself get complacent about my diet and exercise_ so when the weight loss side effect went away_ I gained about 20 lbs in a short amount of time.  I recommend anyone taking this drug to continue being cautious about what you eat and how much you exercise.  The ringing in my ears and dizziness was pretty bad.  Those side effects never went away.  The medication seems to help my mood more on a short-term basis.  It increased my sex drive to the point that it was kind of annoying.  One thing about this medication that I really do not like is that it seems to increase the amount of migraines I get.,F,38,2  years300 mg 1X D,7/5/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl
27, 5, Anxiety_ depression,I have taken this medication on and off for the last 3 years. I was treated with opiates for a severe car accident. One day I realized the opiates were making my brian mush_ and destroying my attention span_ so I attempted to stop taking the opiates. Little did I know the horrors of opiate detox. Once again_ I started taking wellbutrin at my doctors urging. It was a life saving drug for me. For me_ (maybe from the opiate detox period) the Wellbutrin worked great the first few days with an immediate marked difference_ the second week was rough_ but the third week an on was miraculous. I still cannot believe the difference. I have a terrible back and fibro. This medication along with a CNS suppresent like Horizant has killed all of my pain. I want to cry now thinking about what it took to get where I am today_ 100% pain free. Please people_ don't rely on opiates alone. There is good medication such as this that doesn't have the risks as opiates do. Eventually opiates actually made me hurt MORE due to long term use. I NEVER abused mine in the slightest_ it is just a side effect of long term use. The wellbutrin gave me my life back_ both from depression_ anxiety_ and opiate withdrawal. I really hope that physicians see these reviews and can recommend this drug to those going through opiate WD.,,F,36,3  years300,6/9/2015,Wellbutrin xl

My attention span has been just as bad if not worst then before_ I find myself daydreaming and jumping from task to task just as before only difference is now I have more anxiety when I'm trying to focus a task. I feel like this drug is just a safe med for doctors to give patients seeking help for ADHD so they don't have to actually dig into diagnosing you.this drug doesn't have any major harmful side effects and is non additive so its perfect for a doctor to prescribe out to quiet someone up.

I thought it worked extremely well. For some reason_ I am not taking to it the same as before. This go around is way different and not on a positive note. My period is a month late_  I always have to pee_ I'm constipated_ always tired but can't sleep for a full night and constantly paranoid. I don't know why I'm reacting differently but I'm not enjoying it.

44, 4, generalised anxiety disorder_ insom,Doctor started me on Zoloft because the anxiety and panic attacks triggered a depressive state. After a month of taking it_ I realised that my motivation had decreased dramatically and I started making mistakes at work The Zoloft also caused daytime drowsiness. Tried taking morning_ then evening. No improvement in insomnia. Cut dosage in half_ then took alternate days only and felt motivation improved but insomnia Persiste. The doctor then switched me to Wellbutrin. At first did not notice anything in terms of being more alert at night but about 5 or 6 hours after taking it_ wave of calm would come over me and make me very drowsy. Some improvement in insomnia if I took it later in the Day. Did not know that alcohol cannot be taken with it as it is potentially threatening_ drank beer in the evenings and slept like a log. Now that I know it cannot be taken with alcohol I am not sure whether Wellbutrin induced sleep or whether it was the alcohol that induced sleep as its effects are magnified. Also noticed a slight increase in appetite. Should I be concerned with paradoxical effects of Wellbutrin? Has anyone's doctor advised ceasing Wellbutrin as a result of these effects? Don't feel emotionally blunted as with SSRIs. Friends have commented how well I look and they're no longer complaining I'm flippant and distant. If this works for sleep_ it  is a good drug. Reduced craving for nicotine.,,F,30,9  days150 mg,3/7/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl

This is the only drug that is successfully treating my depression and allowing me to live a normal happy life. I wish the FDA would re-evaluate the generic brands - the coatings on them are all over the place so I would usually get a full blast of the drug after 2 hours_ then nothing for the rest of the day (the coatings did not allow for extended release). I ended up almost killing myself while on the generics.,F,54,6  years300 1X D,2/22/2015,Wellbutrin xl

I have tried to withdraw from this drug numerous times_ with the help of my dr_ but was never successful_ due to the horrible withdrawal symptoms.  In the past_ I never used Wellbutrin_ to transition from Paxil to Wellbutrin.  My Dr. suggested it this time_ due to the weight gain. I have had only had one horrible day and night of the Paxil flu.  I am now off of Paxil_ two weeks and think it has left my system.  Please listen to this big news_ because in the past I have never been able to get off of Paxil_ but never used Wellbutrin to help me.  I have the beginning side effects of Wellbutrin 150 lx_ but I am sure they will go away with time.  My other siblings use this medication and it works for them.  We are all genetically disposed to depression_ since my Father suffered from it.

Went to doc in May of 2013_ and he prescribed me 300 xl with no titration.  My hands shook so bad i couldn't write if i tried. Never had any insomnia or nausea as others have said_ but most of the side effects have subsided now. The increase in anxiety has caused me to drink more_ as the alcohol relaxes me. I am going to go to doc next week and try and give Buspar a go. I have tried Celexa and just recently Lexapro(10mg) which the side effects were just too hard to want to go through my life with-since the very day I took it_ no sex drive at all. I still have not had sex for 6 months_ so hoping desire comes back soon as it is creating tension at home. I am also taking this with Concerta(36mg) for ADD and now motivation and energy are very good. I did notice a massive increase in libido in the first 5 months_ but that has toned down(argh) to the point that I'm not obsessed anymore. With all the side effects listed_ the question might come up as to why I would rate this so high. The fact is I FEEL GOOD. The vivid dreams are so real_ I have to ask SO the next day if I said something previously or did I dream it. I also find that alot of detail is remembered the next day- and some are stupid but entertaining.,M,58,1.5  years300mg 1X D,2/20/2015Email,Wellbutrin xl

It did help with both of those but my anxiety got really bad and I had horrible heart palpitations constantly.  I haven't had caffeine in over 8 years because of my heart being a bit sensitive and I quit smoking almost 2 years ago so it wasn't those things causing the palpitations.  I ended up back on the Paxil and have been off Wellbutrin for 4 days and I finally slept my first full night last night in over 2 months and I feel my palpitations lessening each day.

Fifteen or sixteen years ago_ my life became very stressful with sick elderly parents_ a brother with cancer and a young son diagnosed with a neurological disorder. Until then_ I was on no meds. I first experienced anxiety but Paxil saved me there. I had to go on thyroid medication and I needed estrogen and progesterone. Things were good for a while then I became ""Blue"". It was severe. I was sad. Yes_ I had plenty to be sad about_ but life had to go on so off I went to the dr again. I was prescribed 150mg of Wellbutrin XL to start. Not much happened so my dose was changed to 300 mg's. That worked for several years and then I started to get blue again so my doctor bumped me up to  450 mgs. I take a 300 and a 150 per day. This dose continues to work for me several years later. I don't know what I'll do if it stops because this is as high as you can safely go. Any higher can put you at a risk for seizures. I absolutely do not have any bad side effects AS LONG as I stay on the name brand. The GENERIC DOES NOT WORK for most people.The interesting thing is that while I needed a higher dose of Wellbutrin_  I am super sensitive to Prozac as just 5 mgs will make me very apathetic.

75, 5, depression_ hopelessness_ anxiety,Jittery in beginning,This medication has worked so well for me.  2 years ago I was so hopeless I began researching antideprssants_ and after a lot of reading and also reading the reviews on this site I chose to ask my doctor for Wellbutrin_ XL_ name brand.  When I first began the medication I felt so jittery_ like I was going to come out of my skin_ so I took the 150mg pills and cut them in half_ and took the half dosage for a week or so before going back to the the full dosage_ and that did the trick.  It took several weeks to feel any effect_ but I went from feeling hopeless - as though I had nothing at all to look forward to in life - to feeling much more positive_ happy_ and normal.  I think I had been depressed my entire life and these somehow normalized me.  These have a slightly energizing effect until you are used to them_ but they do not keep me up at night (I take in the morning).  I have remained on the 150mg dosage.  Its seems to have a mild appetite curbing effect_ although I was not overweight to begin with_ these at least do not increase appetite. I am not mixing these with any other med_ so it is easy to tell the effect these have on me_ as I have stopped taking them for short periods and then gone back.  The trick is to take as low a dosage as possible_ in the beginning_ or you may feel more nervous and anxious for a short while until you adjust.  I would suggest trying 75mg to begin with if the 150mg is too much_ and then GIVE IT TIME to work.,F,46,2  years150mg 1X D,9/4/2014,Wellbutrin xl

However_ despite everyone telling me I should get some help_ I've been in denial. Beginning at age 18_ I self-medicated with alcohol and painkillers (prescribed to me for my Crohn's Disease)_ which eventually led to a heroin addiction. Upon entering rehab in April 2005_ I was put on Suboxone 24mg for my opiate addiction. In the past few years_ I have been weaned down to a maintenance dose of 8mg. Due to the long term use_ it has been extremely difficult and made my ""issues"" worse. Not only has Wellbutrin helped my emotions_ but it's given me energy and helped with my procrastination/disorganization. Since my issues destroyed my relationship and ended our engagement_ I'm now a single mom to 4 young children.

I'm being a better mom and_ for the first time in years_ I feel good about myself! Suboxone withdrawal is long and difficult_ and I think Wellbutrin will help when my doctor and I decide the time is right.

Binge eating_ I'm not hungry but can't stop eating.,I had tried taking wellbutrin in my early 20's and had to stop because of suicidal thoughts etc. however it has been about 15 years since then so I decided to give it another try. I did not start feeling any relief from depression (and seemed to have gotten worse) until about week 6. Now I don't feel so extremely low and sometimes have a good day. Honestly I have noticed no increase in energy but have noticed an increase in libido_ which happened around week 3 or 4. I have cut down my smoking to a few cigarettes a day from over a pack for almost 18 yrs. However due to my agitation_ irritability_ and anger I am not quitting completely at this time. Interestingly I have severe menstrual cramps and it seems to help this ailment somewhat. When I was taking Prozac I always lost weight so it is interesting that on Wellbutrin XL (a drug known to help with weight loss) I am quickly gaining weight by binge eating. Perhaps it is due to cutting down on smoking_ however most information I read led me to believe this wouldn't be much of an issue. I am hopeful that the Wellbutrin's effectiveness will continue to increase over the next month and that my anger and irritability will decrease_ as well as my appetite. It is worth a try for anyone thinking of getting on it but keep in mind it can take several weeks of misery before you feel some relief_ not always the case but something to keep in mind.

136, 4, Depression,Faster heart beat at timesSlight tremor after caffeine consumptionHeartburnConstipationHAPPINESSEXCITEMENTIMPROVED SOCIAL SKILLS AND RELATIONSHIPS,First off_ I am a med student and know a good amount about antidepressants.  NO ONE should be commenting on how bad this drug is before they have taken the drug for 6- 8 weeks.  This drug_ as many other antidepressants_ take many weeks to take effect.  The drug has to build up in your bloodstream and level out_ becoming consistent before you start to feel positive effects.  There has to be a consistent level of drug that you are taking in and that you are excreting.  SO - do not listen to the reviews that say after 1 day or 3 weeks that the drug was awful.  Everyone is different_ antidepressants are known for their shitty side effects_ and it is a FACT that you have to wait for them to work.  This is not a fast food restaurant - you don't get what you want right away.  These are neurotransmitters and receptors that are being altered in the brain.  That does not mean that it will work for everyone after those first 8 weeks_ however those people who are posting negative comments after 1 day or a week are just scaring those people who maybe want to try this drug.SO_ I had awful side effects when I started this drug.  Insomnia_ panic attacks_ jitters_ palpitations...you name it.  However_ by week 2 or 3_ the side effects slowly started to go away... and after two months of being on the drug I honestly could not be happier.  I have never been excited about anything in my life_ and I mean anything.

141, 2, SAD/anxiety,tremors_ unable to put words and thoughts together_ night sweat_ headache_ agitation_ heart palpatations_ no appetite,I live in the Pacific Northwest so I wanted something to ease the long winter depression and also day to day issues. I was told by my dr to take one 150mg for 3 days and then two 150mg a day thereafter (total 300mg). I was taking the generic. The first day I felt nothing much other than a slight annoying headache.Then the next day I took another and that evening got shaky_ extremely agitated_ unable to focus and put words together. My heart was racing and felt like it was coming out of my chest. My husband said it was like I was on speed. That night I woke up drenched from sweat. The next morning I could barely focus my eyes to work. They actually hurt. Head still hurt also and everyone I talked to_ I still had to stutter my words out because I couldn't think of what I was trying to say. I had to try really hard to think and make sensible words. I decided that this was not for me. I didn't care to give it any longer. Today I was looking at the bottle and noticed that it said 300mg tablets. So if I had taken the prescribed dosage I would have been taking 600mg on the fourth day!!!! Guess its a very good lesson to read your prescription bottles before taking! Now I need to decide who is at fault. The pharmacy or the dr. Not that it matters because I won't be taking any dosage or anything higher. If I wanted to take meth I can get that anywhere and not need a prescription.,F,41,2  days300 1X D,8/10/2012,Wellbutrin xl

I've gained 10lbs in the month I've been off it_ am excessively tired and find myself less happy in general - but I don't want to continue to lose more hair. It's very upsetting because when I first started losing my hair I checked the side effects of Wellbutrin and it's not listed as one so I assumed it was from something else.

You need to take both or either for at least several weeks to get the full effect of the drug. Do not judge them too quickly. The wellbutrin alone causes some anxiety. Weight loss and added sex drive were a plus. The anxiety went away when I added Lexapro 10mg/day. Lexapro can cause weight gain initially so watch out for this.I also take DHA (not DHEA) that helps with memory and general mood. The brand name Wellbutrin XL is much better than the generic.

Initially Cipralex did help me with my anxiety & overall out look on life_ however in the process in gained almost 25 pounds. I couldn't stop eating or thinking about food. After one week of 150mg on Wellbutrin & on 300mg I feel better than ever. My anxiety is has subsided_ I have so much more energy_ motivation & my libido has finally came back. I also lost most the weight I gained & my appetite is not out of control as it was. My relationship with my whole family has improved as well not to mention that I doing well @ my job as well. The only down side I can think of is that I usually need Zopiclone to help me fall asleep  as my energy levels seem to be high at bed time as well. For me the benefits far out weigh the insomnia. We all have different body chemistry_ environments etc_ so I can understand that what may work for one person may not work for another. Unfortunately as with most SSRI's it's trial and error & I'm thankful I didn't have to try so many other meds other than Cipralex as mentioned.

Wellbutrin sent me on a wild ride that saw me end up in the mental hospital 3x before the doctors and I figured out it was the change from Abilify to Wellbutrin that had caused all the paranoia_ hallucinations_ and crazy things I did under the influence of Wellbutrin. My pharmacist had even gone so far as to initially refuse to fill the script when he saw I was taking Topamax for migraines saying the two would intereact terribly_ my psychiatrist convinced him to go ahead and fill it something I deeply regret as I spent 5 months losing my mind wondering what the Hell was happening to me before figuring out it must be the Wellbutrin as any pyschosis  and mania would have shown up in my psyche before now.

171, 5, major depression,some stomach discomfort; some jaw clenching_ night sweats,I have recently been having more trouble than ever with night sweats and chills  accompanied by anxiety and depression.  It was so bad I stopped taking the medication for several days in order to get sleep.  I did this twice going back on Wellbutrin when my mood dropped severely.  The second time I finally took a pill in the evening_ which I had never tried before_ since it is supposed to be activating.  I slept just fine without the hot flashes from Hell and  mood disturbances.  I'm thinking for me this appears to be a fix for the problem.  I've been taking the medication in the evening for three days and so far_ so good.  For a few days my day time mood was a little low_ so I took a small amount of Adderall which I had reduced to practically none because of insomnia.  The small amount of Adderall hasn't caused insomnia so far.  I really should have realized Wellbutrin could not be very activating for me since I had on a few occasions taken it in the morning and managed to go back to sleep. Eating low carb for my mild diabetes has helped me sleep better in general.  Perhaps going totally off the Adderall caused this recent sleep problem. Maybe I need just the right amount: not too much_ not too little.  So_ maybe I should keep taking the 2.5 mg Adderall as well as taking Wellbutrin in the evening.,F,58,12  days300 mg 1X D,2/26/2012Email,Wellbutrin xl

What works for me may not work for you.  In my experience_ this is the only medication that works for me 100%. I have been on it for at least 10 years and was off during my pregnancy in 09. A week after I had my son_ I had a severe postpartum episode and my doc told me to take my Wellbutrin right away. I was hoping to stay off of the meds for good. By the next day_ I felt a little better and within a week_ I was back to myself. I owe a lot to Wellbutrin. I would not have been able to care for my own child if I didn't have it. On the other hand_ when I went to 300 mg_ I had severe rage. It was unreal! I know my limit now but won't give up the Wellbutrin b/c I've seen first-hand how it has helped me. I've also seen it do the exact opposite to others. I feel the need to review the medication b/c of how well it works for me but I hope that everyone 'googling' medications realizes that it's trial and error if you're at the point where you need medication.

Two brief episodes of dizziness/light-headedness.,"Month 1- 75mg - Dry mouth for a week. No other side-effects_ gloomy depression ""fog"" remained. ~~Month 2- 150mg - Dry mouth returned for 3-4 days. Fog is clearing. ~~ Month 3- 300mg - Dry mouth only 1-2 days. Told to take half pills first week which I did; wondered later if that affects dissolution/absorption rate. Not a chemist_ unsure what is meant by delivery system membrane through which active ingredient passes  pills outer coating or chemically-bound envelope surrounding individual molecules of active ingredient? ~~ Lifetime sinus sufferer_ difficult to say if increased post nasal drip & throat-clearing is coincidental. Fog seems gone_ but motivation/pursuit of normal activities still crippled. ~~NOTE: During first 2 weeks of 300mg dosage (scored tablets)_ experienced a couple of  transient episodes of dizziness/light-headedness - first time in my life. Don't know if this is related to half tablets/absorption rate? Could pose a problem if youre driving or on a staircase. ~~No other negative symptoms. Am taking brand name for now but cost is ridiculously expensive (no health insurance) so can't continue for more than another month or two. Will shift to generic but concerned about negative press from ambulance chasers (i.e._ class action vulture lawyers). First sign of bad symptoms I'm out of here. ~~FWIW_ for me ""talk therapy"" has proved useless.",M,60,11  weeks75-300mg 1X D,2/1/2012Email,Wellbutrin xl

I've taken Wellbutrin from fall-spring for 3 years now_ starting after a suicide attempt that left me on a respirator for days.  It takes about a month to really have an effect.  The things that bother me most are the nauseousness_ blurred vision_ and constipation.  I will continue to take it though_ because it has worked infinitely better for me than an SSRI.  I cannot say that it will help everyone; but for me_ the willingness to live is greater than the side effects.,F,24,6  months300 mg 1X D,1/20/2012,Wellbutrin xl

The only positive thing I can take away from my 2 weeks on WXL was the insight into my anxiety triggers that occurred while I was on the meds. I was barely functional _ cried for hours_ and spent the rest of the time staring at the wall. Anxiety came in waves_ 4-5 panic attacks per day_ had to increase my Citalopram .5x just to function. I'm a psychotherapist and I advocate trying this if you think it may help you_ just be aware of your triggers and monitor your emotions carefully so as not to spiral out of control.,M,25,14  days150 1X D,1/11/2012Email,Wellbutrin xl

I have better sex drive and I can tell you this medication has at the beginning a lot of side effects: dry mouth_ dry throat_ forgetfulness ( I enjoyed it)_ insomnia but after 2 month everything got a bit milder_ and I would recommend this medication to everyone who suffers from long time unemployment.,M,37,3  months150mg 1X D,12/31/2011Email,Wellbutrin xl
185, 1, MDD (Major Depressive Disorder),It is obvious that drug reps are ghost writing for this drug. Leave it to the drug companies to prey on depressed people. Wellbutrin XL BRAND NAME or GENERIC is nothing but a stimulant. It has little to no antidepressant affect. My doctor just retired and I saw his sample cupboard. It was full of Wellbutrin XL BRAND NAME. He told me he couldn't give it away for free. Here in Canada the BRAND NAME is dirt cheap. I know five people that have been on it and all reproted the same - stimulant - no antidepressant affect. Those with GAD or Panic Disorder avoid this med! The best use of this drug is perhaps ADD or augmentation of an SSRI to give the depressed patient some energy. Which is what it's been used for since it's inception. Stand-alone_ it's not effective in the least.,,M,40,3  months300,12/30/2011,Wellbutrin xl

Increased sex drive but with all the side effects it didn't matter.,"I was on Wellbutrin SR for 9 days.  Side effects listed got worse each day until I was afraid to take the pill.  I stopped it after the 9th day of feeling awful.  I normally go to the gym three days a week and do the elliptical for an hour.  I went to the gym on the 4th day and could not even do 15 minutes on the elliptical_ I thought I was going to have a heart attack.I would not recommend this drug for anyone who is naturally thin because the weight loss was drastic and made me feel sick.  I would not recommend this to anyone on blood pressure medication.  This stuff is ""speed"" on steroids.   Oh and forgetfulness.  Went out to eat ordered lunch and when it came_ I didn't remember ordering what I did.  Couldn't eat it anyway.  Luckily I had no side effects from immediate withdrawal.

My story_ I use-to be always a very positive happy person.About a year and a half ago I went from being anorexic to overweight because of depression. I stopped eating all together and somehow became a binger to fullfill my depression. My hair started to fall out because of all the stress and I never slept. I needed help. After taking this_ I feel so much happier with life and started going out again. I slept better for the most part but still have insomnia some nights.

After two months_ my ponytail started to thin out.  I attributed it to change of seasons.  Now I have to clean my hairbrushes out every two days_ I find my hair all of the place_ on the floor_ in my lint trap in my clothes dryer and I've noticed bald patches in my scalp.  I had fine hair to begin with but this is ridiculous.  And to say that it's made my depression worse_ to say the least.  I will be tapering down this med tomorrow. And I had to buy Rogaine.  I'm 33 years old.  I wish I never took this med.  It's given me more problems than I had to start out with.  I'd rather be depressed than bald.,F,33,3  months450 1X D,12/1/2011Email,Wellbutrin xl

(please do not stop reading here_ see important additional comments),I was in a deep depression_ my face_ voice_ i was unrecognizable_ had no hope at all. I was expecting that Wellbutrin would make effect in 2 weeks_ but it did not_ not even a little improvement. Between the second and third week of taking the medicine_ i wanted to see my doctor to ask for change the medicine_ but the doctor was not available. Fortunately_ the Wellbutrin wasn't changed_ because after just 2 weeks and 6 days I could start to feel the difference_ it's like being hold under water and finally reach air and breath.I know what depression is_ so i kindly ask all who are going through this without hope: do not give up the medicine_ hold on at least one month if necessary_ even without feeling a difference_ it takes time but will work.For just 6 days_ i would give up Wellbutrin_ and maybe kept with no hope_ in this hell called depression.,M,35,3  weeks150mg 1X D,11/30/2011Email,Wellbutrin xl
191, 5, chronic fatigue_ rls_ painful sex,none,This drug is a miracle and may have saved my marriage!!  Here is my story: I was on this drug years ago for depression and it helped.  I felt better and got off.  Over the next three years I developed painful bladder syndrome which caused painful intercourse as well as horribly low energy (chronic fatigue) and restless leg syndrome (rls).  My doctor thought maybe a low level of dopamine was causing the last two_ so he prescribed me wellbutrin.  Not only do I have a regular amount of energy again_ but it CURED my painful bladder syndrome and sexual dysfunction.  If you have these kinds of symptoms_ please try wellbutrin (I may actually move down to 75 mg of the original_ as  I am occasionally a bit jittery).

193, 4, Depression,Insomnia (subsided after the first month); Loss of Appetite (subsided after the first month); No other noticeable side effects.,This medication changed my life. I was so depressed I didn't even remember what it was like to actually feel normal. I am much more calm_ less moody_ have more energy_ and am just a happier person. At first_ it would keep me wide awake at night but that was just while I was getting used to the medication. Also_ when I first started taking it_ I did notice a loss of appetite but my appetite came back too. I've been using it for 5 months now and I sleep great_ I eat normally and I haven't experienced any other notable side effects. For the first time in years I actually feel normal. I've tried Lexapro_ Effexor_ and Cymbalta to combat my depression. And although those helped for a short time_ the side effects were too much for me.

I also felt kind of spacey/had slight memory loss/trouble concentrating for the first week.,I love this drug!  Prior to wellbutrin_ I had tried pretty much every SSRI available and had too much trouble w/ the side effects to stay on them.  Wellbutrin does not sedate me like the SSRIs did_  I still have my feelings and my sex drive_ and I haven't gained any weight.  I have lost about 5 pounds_ but I attribute that to feeling so good that I no longer stress eat and I feel more motivated to get out of bed and go to the gym.  I also notice that certain things that used to upset me don't upset me any more.  I had an altercation w/ a coworker the other day_ which normally would've stressed me out to the point of not sleeping for days.  Instead_ I left work and although I did feel annoyed about the situation_ I was able to rationalize in my head and it didn't really get to me.  I only rated this drug a 4 because it hasn't helped me quit smoking (cigs taste worse but I still want them)_ and it caused my migraines to increase.

I was able to get brand name Wellbutrin XL after reading reviews of the generic.  I experienced severe depression a few weeks into taking it_ I upped the dose to 300mgs and began taking it in the am because of severe insomnia.

I only told two people I was taking this med but EVERYONE told me how easy and pleasant I had become to be around. And did I mention I was incredibly productive. Then my best friend committed suicide and for a week straight_ our circle of friends all grieved and drank relatively heavily.  I was crying all day and drinking like 3 drinks at night.  I had no idea you shouldn't drink on this medication.  The same week he died I had a grand mal seizure and woke up in a pool of my own blood.  My doc took me off the medication that day.  7 years later nothing has worked as well and my life has never been as good as it was those 4 months I was on Wellbutrin.  I just had a root canal for the tooth that was shattered during the seizure and I have a scar on my lip that has faded.  I know it sounds completely crazy but I want to go back on the Wellbutrin.  I feel like I'm living a shadow of the life I had when I was on this drug.  I haven't had a seizure since that one 7 years ago and I feel if I was on 100mg/day and not a drop of alcohol I'd likely be fine.

Even then I only eat a few bites before I don't want anymore.),At 450 mg it worked GREAT! Then I got dumped by my bf and started having bad anxiety (panic attacks and general stress related anxiety symptoms).  Doc says anxiety shouldnt be caused by wellbutrin since I didn't have issues with anxiety during the first 3 months of taking it.  Currently taking Xanax 3 times a day to keep the anxiety at bay.  I'm concerned that the wellbutrin in conjunction with the amount of stress I'm under at work and at home could be making things worse.  I hope that's not the case because on the 450mg it worked wonders for me and I am scared to change to something else yet again.,F,27,4  months450mg 1X D,12/7/2010Email,Wellbutrin xl

I toughed it out through the freaky brain zaps and staying up all night thinking I was going to have a seizure stuff - but the itching and heartburn proved to be too much. It just won't stop. The palms of my hands itch_ what is that???? I did not take the pill this morning and I don't think I am taking it anymore. I hope this terrible itching goes away.

259, 5, Depression & Anxiety,Dry mouth,I must say that I am pleasantly surprised at the effectiveness of this drug after only two days.  I took Paxil 20mg for 10 years for anxiety_ depression_ and insomnia.  I had to have it upped to 40 mg in Dec. 2010 as I was beginning to have obsessive thoughts that were bothersome.  That worked for a year_ but this Dec (I think i might have a touch of seasonal affective_ as well)_ I began to have obsessive thoughts and insomnia.  So_ the day before yesterday_ I saw my doctor_ and she added Wellbutrin 150 mg to the mix.  I must say_ things have already started to brighten up.  I'm actually a lot more talkative & social than I was for the 10 years that I was on the Paxil 20mg.  The obsessive thoughts are waning (they only pop up when I remind myself that I'm not having them :-).  As a side note_ to those of you who are feeling desparate because your medicine isn't working_ be patient and keep doing what you're doing (reading & writing on this blog & talking to others).  I cannot tell you all how helpful it is to know that I'm not the only person with these issues.  Reading your stories helps immensely!  God bless.,M,34,2  days150mg 1X D,12/1/2010Email,Wellbutrin xl

261, 1, Depression,I was on Lexapro from April '10 until November '10.  I had immediate and fantastic results.  I noticed around October that the depression was coming back.  I started having anxiety attacks and was totally numb.  I finally lost it and took a leave of absence.  The doctor said I would be better with Wellbutrin. I started at 150 and felt better.  When I upped to 300 (taking 2 150s) I was still good.  Almost immediately after taking the Teva 300mg_ I went downhill- with side effects like itching and jumpiness.  I can't believe the complaints about Teva's 300xl and it is still being prescribed and pharmacies claim there isn't a difference.

Continuing side effects_ return of a healthy sex drive_ dry mouth after sleep_ constipation_ insomnia_ weight loss and loss of compulsive eating_ increased motivation and energy and ability to problem solve effectively.,This medication changed my life.  The depression ceased almost immediately which is rare.  I lost 20 lbs_ began to exercise and eat healthy_ and short temperedness went away. In spite of more extremely stressful life conditions it has helped me stay the course.  People comment how young I look which is true. I attribute this to weight loss and the absence of anxiety in my face.  I eventually needed more help after 2 years and added 15mg Deplin 1x daily.  Another medication that has really helped me. To combat constipation I take 2-stool softeners at night.  For sleep_ I started with 50 mg of Trazadone nightly which after 2 years we changed to 100mg nightly.  I have no side effects or ever experienced headaches.

I hadn't taken it in a couple years but decided I wasn't going to deal with another Northeast winter without it.  I've been on it for 2 weeks now and feel much better_ not quite perfect yet but I know it takes about 5-6 weeks for it to really kick in.  Love the feeling of hope instead of feeling hopeless like so many other winters.  I would recommend this for depression_ I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR PANIC DISORDERS.  It causes slight anxiety in those of us who don't suffer with panic disorders.

270, 5, Depression/PTSD/Anxiety,Weight loss_ decreased appetite_ couldn't be around cigarette smoke_ nausea,"This is an amazing_ amazing prescription_ better than Zoloft or Lexapro for me. A few things to know_ having gone on and off: 1. You MUST TAKE THIS REGULARLY and try not to miss any doses. If I missed more than 2 days_ I felt floaty and ""not present."" Then going back on made me anxious for several days. 2. Going on it you will be pretty jittery and anxious at first. When I first went on_ I had two panic attacks in the first few weeks. It is actually contraindicated for anxiety because it is a stimulant. 3. Once you get through the first month_ it is really great. I have more energy_ more libido_ less appetite...I always lose weight when I'm on and gain when I'm off. 4. The TIME OF DAY YOU TAKE IT is very important. Many problems people have could be solved by changing the time of day they take it. If it makes you sleepy (some people say it does)_ take it at night. If it makes you jittery_ take it in the morning before you do anything so that can wear off. Etc. 5. GENERICS. Be careful with the XL generics_ studies have shown they aren't as effective. They have been fine for me but not everyone. 6. It is really_ really good for most things. Not necessarily anxiety_ but as a mood stabilizer_ it is great_ and frankly its side effects are often more positive then negative.

I felt high and my anxiety level was out the roof.  I also had this weird pain in my chest or back.  So my DR. instructed i cut back to 150mg so hopefully that will be enough.  The dose needs to be taken in the early morning because it can cause insomnia.  I feel very alert at night but i'm able to fall asleep.

287, 5, Stop Smoking,Only mild insomnia.,I was smoking almost 2 packs of cigarettes per day and I needed to stop. In doing research_ I came across this medication. Also read where there were bad side affects using generic that were not there with the brand.  I chose to spend $76/mo co-pay for the brand. I started taking one 150 mg capsule in the AM on 7/22/10. I was told I could continue to smoke for the first week while taking the pills but to  cut back. By 7/28 I was smoking about 11 cigarettes per day. I was noticing more general irritation and agitation. Per my doctor_ I increased the dose to 2 pills/ day  1 in AM and the other about noon.  The irritation went away quickly. I was quickly getting tired at planning when I could smoke again (by now I was only smoking portions of a cigarette).  I ran out of my menthol cigarettes on 7/31 but did have a pack of regular cigarette (part of my plan to quit). When I woke up on 8/1/10 I decided to try not smoking at all. I put the unopened pack in my purse (for just in case). I was doing so well that on 8/5 I decided to wean myself off the pills so went back to 1/day for that last week  (I could not afford another month of pills). My doctor told me that it was customary to take the pills for 8-12 weeks before stopping  but I just could not afford it and did not want to use the generic version.  As it is turning out_ all is well anyway. Today is 9/18/10 and I have not had a cigarette for 7 weeks. I AM home free!!

On BRAND NAME- teeny tiny headache_ some aggressive moods at night for some reason.,For those of you wondering if GENERICS vs. BRAND NAME WELLBUTRIN makes a difference_ it did for me! I have always chosen generics for everything due to costs_ but this one I will NEVER go back to. The generic version does have the exact same active ingredient to treat depression (Bupropion)_ but the other 20% goes to additives_ fillers_ and releasing agents. These fillers can release the active ingredient sporadically causing many side effects. The timing and amounts of the medicine released really messed me up. I have noticed that the brand name releases consistently and evenly so I do not have the fluctuating feelings throughout the day. I feel calmer and more stable. I just felt plain awful on generic (grouchy-shaky-sweaty-nervous-agitated). Everyone reacts differently to drugs_ so this is just my experience. If you are taking generic and feel awful_ just try the name brand for a couple of weeks to see if you can tell a difference. It is worth it! I called my dr. and got samples before I filled a prescription. I just wanted to know for myself the hype between generics and brand name. If you do well on the generic version_ then you're lucky. I'd much rather pay $6.00 than $100 (for 3mos.)  But with depression feeling better is worth my $94.00!,M,42,3  weeks150 1X D,9/15/2010Email,Wellbutrin xl

Made me feel clear-headed_ creative_ energized_ positive_ and inspired. I didn't dwell on my problems; instead_ I started looking for (+ acting on) solutions. It was wonderful for school/adhd and I had great weight loss. At first_ combining it with caffeine gave me the shakes and a very scary feeling but later it started being ok. The major problem with this med is that it pooped out. It went from being a lifesaver to_ in a matter of several months_ almost completely inert in my body. Restarting it since then (after long breaks) has sometimes helped a bit_ sometimes not at all. Very sad.,F,22,14  months300 1X D,8/30/2010,Wellbutrin xl

296, 5, Severe Depression,,I've found that Wellbutrin has been the only thing that has worked for me thus far- but CANNOT take the generic.  I've tried to transition to the generic form on 4 occassions d/t insurance issues_ money issues_ MD request_ etc.... it has caused me to slip into a deeper depression and it was only after a SELF Magazine article pulished in 2008 or 2009 about the generic forumlation causing worsening depression -that I realized that was the same thing that happened to me...  to this day_ I will gladly pay the difference in the price of the original trade name and will never go generic again.  I have had no sexual side effects.  I have had no adverse reactions.  I only wish it gave me more energy and motivation.

I thought this drug was suppose to give me energy. I'm more tired now than before I started taking it. I guess I'm mildly depressed as I have a good life_ but yet can't feel happy. I lost my sex drive 2 years ago after having my daughter and I am really hoping that this drug will work for me in that regard. I haven't been as irritable or snappy. That gnawing daily mad feeling has dissapeared. I'm wondering how long does it take to feel the effects of an increased libdo?

300, 4, In conjunction with Cymbalta,I'm using the Watson generic and it's working just fine in conjunction with my Cymbalta.  But NOT ALL GENERICS ARE CREATED EQUALLY...read on...,"The man who posted on Feb 27th is RIGHT ON !!  My pharmacy will only stock brand name Wellbutrin XL or the Watson generic.  And my doc won't let me fill it with anything else.  The man who posted on Feb 4th is WRONG.  Generics are not all created equally.  First he says the generic must fall within 10% - THEN he states they are EXACTLY the sameNOT TRUE.  They must have the same medicine - but the fillers and the release mechanisms are NOT always the same.  Anyone taking this RX should cut & paste the website posted by Mr. Feb 27th.....and READ the study.  It even comments on how much BIGGER the TEVA generic pill is than the Wellbutrin XL & Watson pills.  I suspect  that Mr. Feb 4th SELLS Generic Drugs...and by the way...it's very rude of you to ""talk down"" to us on this site.  Folks are only reporting what THEY experience.  I agree_ it does take at least 2 weeks for these types of drugs to start making a difference...but some of us do a bit of research on our own_ and have read up on meds when we are prescribed them.  If they have different delivery mechanisms_ or if they have extra or different fillers - then it's NOT EXACTLY the same.  So_ there is a market for generics SIR_ but obviously when it comes to this drug  only Wellbutrins original and Watsons generic will do !!!

It is useless.,F,22,4.5  weeks150 mg 1X D,7/23/2010,Wellbutrin xl
302, 5, depression,I haven't had any side effects from Wellbutrin or the generic alternative.  When I first began the medication_ I was severely depressed most days of a given month.  I noticed improvement very soon after beginning the med.  Not all days are depression free_ but most of them are.  And the magnitude of depression is not what it once was either.  So I'm happy with the medication.,My only concern is long term usage.  I've been on a long time (I said 8 years_ but I think it is much more -- like 12-ish).  My doctor has not informed me of any long term complications of the medication_ so I'm still on it.  Plus I'm post menopausal now (wasn't not when I first started)_ so it may be helping with menopausal-based depression as well.,F,51,8  years300 1X D,7/13/2010,Wellbutrin xl

SEVERE increase in eating disorder/OCD symptoms (restriction_ counting_ etc.)",I have been on several mood stabilizers such as Trileptal_ Lamictal_ and Abilify_ but none of them helped my depression very much_ but they did zap my manic stages! Abilify also made me gain 20 lbs in 5 months...no thank you! I decided I wanted to try an anti-depressant again. The last one I tried was Zoloft_ but that was 5 years ago and also helped me gain weight when I was anorexic (went from 90 to 120 in one year).

I only want to eat fruit_ probably because I have dry mouth_ but obviously that won't fill me up. I can't drink coffee_ and even alcohol has lost it's charm_ though I continue to drink because I feel so miserable. I'm very irritable. I feel sluggish. I get very sleepy in the middle of the day. The only time I feel happy is the brief period in the morning before I take my pill. I feel more depressed on this than I normally do. Oh_ and suicidal. The only positive effect is an increased libido_ which is awesome! I still haven't decided whether that outweighs all the other side effects.,I hope to god I start feeling happy soon. I don't think I can put up with this for more than 2 weeks. Also_ wellbutrin xl is time-released_ meaning it enters your system in small amounts throughout the day. For this reason_ YOU SHOULD NOT CUT WELLBUTRIN IN HALF. You're essentially giving yourself a 24 hr (or 12 with the SR) dosage all at once.,F,31,6  days150 1X D,7/13/2010,Wellbutrin xl

It is the only generic I've had very major problems with.  My insurance company assures me it is the same.  Well_ they are not the ones who are taking it!!!  I'm going to get the Brand name from a Canadian pharmacy where it is much less expensive and is still the original Brand name.  Anyone who tells you the generic is the same does not know what they are talking about.

312, 2, Depression,Agitation_ anxiety_ fogginess_ trouble concentrating_ general weirdness.,I previously was on Celexa_ for a year and a half. It worked great for my depression_ but made me gain weight. So I got off of it_ took nothing for a year_ then decided to try Wellbutrin. My health care practitioner started me on 150 mgs. for seven days_ then had me increase the dosage to 300 mgs. I initially was on the Teva generic. But I heard so many bad things about it_ and felt so awful while on it_ that I decided to get the name brand from Canada. (It's a fraction of the cost of what you pay for the GENERIC in this country!) At any rate_ I just upped the dosage to 300 yesterday_ and I do not feel so hot. I just feel weird. I do have lots of energy; I have been walking or bike riding every day. And I do feel motivated to eat healthy. But I just don't feel right on this med. I will give it another 4 to 6 weeks.

The REAL Welbutrin makes me happy and less depressed_ the generic however_ made me very angry_ tempermental_ and very agitated.  THE GENERIC IS NOT THE SAME MEDICATION FOLKS!!!

More Energy_ better concentration_ more sociable_ yup I am no longer a indoor sleep late watch tv weirdo anymore. I want to go do things all the time. This medication I truly believe has saved my life...I was on the brink just 4 days ago.,This is LONG but YOU will REALLY want TO READ THIS even if your not ADD and your just taking it for depression or anxiety. I think If you are ADHD/ADD and you take Adderall and your depressed this would be the perfect combination... I take both my medications in the morning and I can think clear focus and I am very happy all the time.  If regular serotonin antidepressants don't work for you....Then maybe its because that neurotransmitter is just fine and they ones that need help are dopamine and nor-epinephrine...Wellbutrin is a dopamine and nor-epinephrine re-uptake inhibitor...So it makes your brain recycle and use more of its own chemical(dopa & nor).....This is the best antidepressant for me because i finally have an antidepressant that works on the right transmitters for me. Some people may have a different deficiency with either of their neurotransmitters..So the medications will not make you feel better and could make you worse_ if you take the wrong antidepressant..Thats why there is the serotonin syndrome label.It is because people that are depressed from dopa deficiency are given serotonin which they have enough of so adding the medication increasing serotonin would cause and over load and make you suicidal. I think that is why doctors switch around antidepressants so much its because they are not really sure yet how these chemicals are reacting in our brain but they do know everyone is different and you can only get it right with trial and error.,F,21,5  days150 1X D,5/27/2010Email,Wellbutrin xl

My doctor told me I was depressed due to hormonal chages in women in their thirties_ we have less eggs stored in our ovaries when we start to get into our thirties_ we are not menopausal_ we just have a decrease in estrogen and it makes us an emational wreck!

Like most I take the generic Bupropion and quickly found that generic ""fillers"" DO make a difference. I recently changed prescription locations and my new Bupropion prescription makes me ill 24/7 - all of the side effects I never experienced previously. Found out the generics are made by several different companies and depending on what they use as fillers is the effect you will receive. What's worse is you cannot return the meds that are making you sick. So I'm not sure how you can find the generic that is right for you but do pay attention to the company who provides the generic versions every time you order.",F,39,8  months300 1X D,5/25/2010,Wellbutrin xl

The pharmacist said (this was some years ago) that most people lapse into a coma with this drug if they have a bad interaction.  Me?  I wanted to shut up and out the voices.  I stopped taking the drug ASAP under protest of my therapist.  It took months and months for the effects to totally dissipate.  It was miserable and I made my small son afraid of me.  I would not recommend this drug.  At the time I was 43 years old.  I still remember that drug with intense panic.

I actually tried a different generic brand (can't think of the name) and I could tell the release rate was a lot slower but it just wasn't doing the trick like TEVA was. I slipped quickly back into a depression. I have to say that TEVA does release the medicine faster than it should? but in my case_ this is what my brain like.

336, 5, Depression,Somewhat uncomfortable amount of energy,I was taking lexapro for 2 weeks to treat newly diagnosed depression (though i've been depressed for 2 years). the lexapro was great but my sex drive was completely annihilated and that made me feel a little inhuman_ plus i felt somewhat emotionally numb. so I switched to bupropion & my ability to orgasm was back within the first day of stopping lex. i have a LOT of energy and i have NEVER been an energetic person_ even in childhood. i have kind of a pothead demeanor (or maybe I'm just a pothead) but these past three days I've had crazy energy and everyone is noticing which is actually making me a little uncomfortable. but I like it because I feel up to doing things for the first time in a LONG time and have the energy to actually follow through on plans and enjoy them. yesterday was out of the house from 12-9PM in DC walking around and only felt tired (in a good way) around 10 PM. This drug is a comparable to adderrall in that you can focus on a task for a while and not be thinking about anything else. no trouble sleeping since I take it in the morning. However -- last night around 3 AM (went to bed around midnight) I woke up feeling like I might throw up - not nauseous_ just had a feeling that might happen - and was confused for about 5 minutes_ then fell asleep very quickly after realizing nothing was going to happen. In my [[inexpert]] opinion_ you should try this drug for depression if you're already low energy_ have a low sex drive_ and aren't prone to anxiety attac,F,22,3  days150 mg 1X D,4/11/2010,Wellbutrin xl

I am trying to build muscles so this isn't a good side effect.  First 2 weeks I had migraines_ sluggish bowel movements_ feeling speedy and overly horny and premature ejaculation and had hives for 2 days.,The brand name Wellbutrin XL is amazing.  I have been depressed my whole life and it kept getting worse where I found myself ordering insulin vials online so I can inject myself with an overdose and die from hypoglycemia.  I rushed to the doctors as my last hope because abusing illicit drugs only gave temporary relief_ I got Wellbutrin (I like that it deals with dopamine and I believe I have problems with that neurotransmitter).  I have NO suicidal ideation.  I still get sad but I don't get thrown into a tail spin.  I am stable. Love this drug.

Walgreens keep switching manufactures of the generic and I was becoming depressed and eating again. In Wisconsin insurance companies will not pay for anti-depression meds.  It was costing me $130.00 for 30 day supply from Walgreens.  I now pay $165.00 for 90 day supply from Canada_ and it is the real deal Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.  You really fell a difference.

Within 2 weeks I began tolerating it better (no headaches_ etc)_ but my appetite was still out of control.  After 6 weeks on 150 mg_ I upped the dose to 300 mg daily.  The difference in appetite is INCREDIBLE.  I don't care much for food_ and when I do eat_ I can only eat half.  Energy levels are slightly better than on 150mg dose_ and I am certainly in a positive mood more frequently.  Thus far_ it has been a fantastic drug.

I just pieced together why I feel so crappy after a night of drinking.  The Wellbutrin stops working--I get a terrible hangover and feel extremely vulnerable_ suicidal and depressed when I mix it with alcohol.  Also_ funny enough_ it has not done a thing for my libido (and it didn't in the past before baby).  I'm considering upping to 300mg....,F,29,2  years150mg 1X D,3/22/2010,Wellbutrin xl

This may be from lack of sleep... this med gives me insomnia.,I take the generic as early in the am as possible. I take Xanax .25mg prn for anxiety during the day and try to limit caffine. I have had no sex drive/libido problems which is AWESOME after years of none with other meds. I have pretty good energy and actually feel motivated again. I am losing weight also (yes!)I am going to ask my doctor if I can get something for sleep though.

I am glad I waited to increase because the first few weeks were hell.  I was up and down and very irritable and had anger spurts.  I hated it.  My doc recommended I give it a try for 6 to 8 weeks.  It gave me tons of energy and I lost 10 pounds in 6 weeks but I still had minor irritability.  The doc decided to up my dosage by 75 and my anger spurts have returned.  I called to get it lowered but they insist it will subsided in a week and I will be back to normal.  I hope so. I hate this anger.

That is my personal experience with it. I read on the internet that the brand name makes a difference in some particular medications including Wellbutrin_ and also read about many other people experiencing less side effects with brand name Wellbutrin- so I decided to try both and see if it affects me.  The problem I'm having now with Wellbutrin is that it works great for a while_ and then it feels like it stops working and my depression comes back.  When it feels like my depression comes back_ I've stopped taking the Wellbutrin_ and stopping it makes my depression 10 times worse.  Uggg.  I wish I didn't have to take prescription medication at all.  I don't want to be on anti-depressants for the rest of my life- but I might not have a choice.

This is different then the large yellow Teva generic version of the pill.  I'm mentioning it here because I was almost ready to go back to my MD to get them to specify the actual WellBurtin_ non generic.  However my insurance company covers the Watson generic_ and not the non generic.

My psychiatrist was confused and said that most experience just the opposite.  I still wanted to give it a chance.  Here is the story:When I first filled my prescription I was only given 2/3 of the pills prescribed b/c they were out of stock.  When I went back to get the rest this was by a different brand but same generic.  The difference was troublesome.  While one was small_ round and white(150mg)_ the other was about 3x its size_ oblong_ and yellow(also 150mg). When I ran out of the first generic(white pill) I started taking other(yellow).  Immediate change.  I wasn't tired_ was +positive & +energy_ mood swings gone_ a bit more anxious; completely different from the 1st.  The only thing in common was weight loss.  I'm 5'2_ used to weigh 121 & now weigh 111.  10 pounds in 6wks and I wasn't that big to start with. The loss of appetite & taste is crazy_I hate my fav. food & each day I crave & loathe something different.  Overall_ not a great drug_ but I feel more balanced.  This was the generic; based on all the reviews here the name brand sounds different & better.  They began another trial recently_ studying difference between the generic & name brand; look it up.

356, 5, Depression,Milder than most antidepressants. Great sex drive_ and positive energy.,Please note that the comments expressed in this forum are largely patients who have very little knowledge about the generic EQUIVELANT to WXL. Chemically identical! The generic version of ANY drug must first pass an extremely strict equivalency test. The potency of the equivalent(generic)drug MUST fall within 10%_ plus or minus_ of the original.The timed release rates may_ however_ differ. But the same amount of drug is released into the bloodstream within a 24 hour period as the name-brand. And it is the nature of all antidepressants to balance eventually to a constant blood level over a 24 hour period. (The release rate becomes less and less important over time as the drug blood levels rise and maintain.)The only difference is in the TRANSITION from name-brand to generic. And most people quit using the generic too soon because of the release rate being different than the name-brand_ the patient may mistakenly believe that the generic isn't going to work for him because of the temporary return of his symptoms.Summery: The name-brand of any drug is EXECTALLY THE SAME AS THE GENERIC. (Read the labels if you don't believe me.) If you are experiencing any return of your symptom while switching from the name-brand to the generic_ you are going through a blood level change due to the change in release rate. But_ don't quit taking it! You will eventually arrive at normal blood levels again. You will readjust.,M,43,30  days150mg 1X D,2/4/2010,Wellbutrin xl

Lots of uncertainty with this drug_ When i stopped taking it last year i had a blast living in a house full of people i barely just met and we'd just basically live on the streets and partying and acid. When i stopped taking it i lived everyday like it was my last and those people i met became my friends. But i wasted valuable savings bonds and learned that life isnt that short. Went back to my parents place and got back on the drug. I feel a lot more mature and motivated.

She switched me to generic wellbutrin 3 weeks ago and I immediately felt better.  My depression is pretty much gone and I have NO side effects.  Unless you count decreased appetite_ which in my case is not a bad thing.  I'm glad I made the decision to try an antidepressant after years of trying to avoid pharmaceutical help for my depression.

I started the Wellbutrin last Saturday 150mg for the first 5 days and then increase to 2x150mg along with the 20mg of Prozac. Since starting Wellbutrin my hands have been shaking. At first I didn't notice it was too bad_ but my hand really shook when I tried to hold a cup in my hand and put it up to my mouth. I actually spilled my drink a little! Besides that I feel like I'm in a fog most of the time. It's really hard to concentrate and I've been forgetting things. I felt like I was in a fog on just the Prozac but I wonder if the Wellbutrin is making it worse. So far_ it has not helped with giving me more energy.

It also helped me to quit smoking even though I was only smoking about 3-5/day.  The strange part about the smoking benefit was that for me_ it had always been more psychological than physical_ but for some reason_ smoking cigarettes after starting WBXL became physically not enjoyable.  I know that sounds strange and I'm not able to fully articulate how it made me feel but I almost want to say it made me feel very jittery and wired.  Remeron helped stabilize me for three solid years with longevity & consistent effectivity that no other drug was able to provide.. *BUT* when life hit me with a couple big stresses and I fell back into the darkness I couldn't shake- WBXL snapped me out of it and within the first couple of weeks.,Just added Wellbutrin to the mix after three solid years of Remeron.

I have not had a panic episode for a month now_ and my anxiety level is what I consider tolerable_ with episodes of anxiety(which often developed into full blown panic attacks) becoming less and less frequent. I backed my dose back down to 150mg a day to see if less drug was effective_ and so far so good...this has reduced the bouts of insomnia as well...    I have noticed my hair shedding a bit(but this might be related more to my age than anything).

Unfortunately_ I have not had the high energy_ increased libido and weight loss that others have reported.  Which stinks because I gained a lot of weight on Lexapro_ Paxil and Effexor. (Effexor was the devil in a bottle for me.) And I have to force myself to eat sometimes--so the weight gain isn't from over-eating or the smoking cessation. Anyone have any advice on the weight_ energy and libido issues?,F,39,1  years,12/30/2009Email,Wellbutrin xl

Depression got worse and I started attending an eating disorder clinic at the same time (for food addiction) - this was in early December. They recommended Wellbutrin. For 2 weeks I was on Cymbalta and WB and it was horrible. I stopped WB and reduced Cymbalta as they wanted to wean me off it. For 2 days now on WB generic 150 mg. only. I want to crawl out of my skin. I'm depressed_ hopeless_ restless_ unable to focus_ not sleeping well_ confused_ shaky_ agitated_ hostile at those around me and just feeling lousy. Will these feelings end soon? How long does it typically take to kick in? It is interfering with my life. I miss Cymbalta_ even though my depression was worse. I was on Paxil before Cymbalta and never experienced these types of side effects with either of those drugs. I need to focus_ ""be present_"" happy and not lethargic given the work I do.

376, 2, major depression,It made me have intense cravings for carbohydrates but I also felt full more quickly than normal.  I was a thin girl to begin with and I lost 11 pounds within the first 2 weeks on this medication.  I also think it made me more sensitive to bright lights.  And it definitely decreased the amount of time I slept (which was a positive side-effect for me because I previously slept 12-14 hours a day... immediately after starting this med I only required ~8 hours and I felt more energized).,I discontinued use of this medication after approximately 2 months.  It did absolutely nothing to aid in treatment of my clinical depression.  I would have stopped taking it earlier_ but I had final exams so I kept taking it because it made me require significantly less sleep_ less food_ less caffeine_ as well as somewhat (albeit temporarily) helped my short-term memory.,F,19,2  months,12/19/2009Email,Wellbutrin xl

My insurance would only cover 30 bucks of the name brand so it would cost me about $140 a month for name brand. So_ I talked with my doc and the pharmacist and they seemed to think it was worth a try on the generic and just to watch me closely. Has anyone had positive effects with the Actavis generic? I am kinda scared but trying it anyway. If it seems to not work_ I am going to consider ordering the name brand online instead. I figured as long as it wasn't by Teva there may be some hope. Please let me know either on here or by email! Its greatly appreciated. Will post my own results in a few weeks!,M,24,1  days,12/10/2009Email,Wellbutrin xl

I think it's cause I feel activated inside but in the wrong way!,I worked too hard in counseling to help resolve my anger issues only to have it flare up again in full force on this med. I've only been on WB for a month but I feel like I'm going bacwards on this med. Yes_ I'm more productive. But it's come at the expense of intesifying my anger/irritablity issues and I hate it. It's causing too much self-loathing and I'm becoming an asshole again. This in-turn is making me hateful towards everyone else. I don't know.

384, 4, Seasonal Affective Disorder,None except constipation.  I also take Cymbalta_ Seroquel_ and Topamax so any anxiety or insomnia is already taken care of.  One word of caution:  for the first two days_ I took the Global brand generic bupropion XL 150mg.  Global is one of Teva's other brands and is exactly the same as Budeprion XL_ the generic of Wellbutrin XL that has caused so many problems.  I only found out that this Global generic was also no good after I took it and got a major body and facial rash and had to go to the Emergency Room and get prednisone.  After that I went to the pharmacy and insisted on the brand-name Wellbutrin XL.,Wellbutrin works differently than other antideppressants such as the SSRI's in that it doesn't work on seretonin; rather_ its main action is on dopamine and norepinephrine.  It is an NDRI_ or a norepinephrine & dopamine reuptake inhibitor.  I like to take an antidepressant from the SSRI or SNRI class (such as Cymbalta)_ and also something like Wellbutrin to keep the fall/winter blues away.  Wellbutrin is also great for energy and gives me focus.  For someone with ADHD and a history of addiction_ Wellbutrin XL is perfect because it is very effective yet non-addictive.  Just make sure you only take the name brand or the Watson generic (it is safe).  Btw_ feel free to e-mail if you want.  Good luck!!,M,27,30  days,12/1/2009Email,Wellbutrin xl

I was upped to 300mg_ experienced even higher activation_ which was a nice lift_ but eventually sent me through the roof. I have never experienced psychosis before and am not really qualified to diagnose it_ but very strange things happened that I only fully recognized after coming off it. This drug has probably ruined my life. I used to joke about warning labels and the wacky symptoms .001% of patients may experience. No more.

394, 4, depression,constipation_ insomnia_ ringing ears,Wellbutrin xl was really great if I am remembering correctly_ but I feel like it has worn off. I think it might have to do with switching to generic_ which I have been on for some months now_ because other people have had that problem. I've been sleeping until noon or later lately. I've definitely experienced a difference with generics in the past_ so I know that that could be a possibility- ATTENTION TO THE PERSON WITH HIVES: I started off with generic for Wellbutrin SR and developed bad hives all over my body! I kept taking the meds because I didn't know it was related but then I read other people experiencing weird things from the non-active ingredients in the generics from a certain lab_ like the kind of dye in the pills or something. I never had hives before_ it was almost scary and lasted for a while until the meds were out of my system. I also had extremely bad side effects while I had the hives- I was talking weird_ spacey_ I felt vertigo sometimes_ had really loud ringing in my ears_ I couldn't poop_ I felt sick and insane. Once i switched to brand name I was fine and I could tell it made a huge positive difference in my life. But now_ after I had switched to brand name SR_ then brand name XL_ I got switched back to generic. No real problems with the generic XL except still constipated every once in a while... but also my food craving/ overeating is kind of creeping back and I've been laying in bed.

Initially_ the medication caused some anxiety_ dry mouth_ and insomnia.  After about 2 weeks the side effects (with the exception of the increased libido) went away and I feel very good.  Just for kicks and giggles_ I tried a 300mg tab and it caused so much anxiety that I thought I would pull out my own hair. It took a couple days to feel normal again after upping it to 300mg.  Anyway_ I am now back with the 150mg tabs as I find anything higher just causes more harm than good for me.  Overall_ Wellbutrin has made a much more positive person then I was prior to taking the meds.  It's even improved my sleep somewhat.  The increase in libido with just 150mg was certainly a nice thing.  I'm very happy.,M,43,1  months,10/9/2009,Wellbutrin xl

My appetite for sex has increased_ which has since improved my relationship with my boyfriend_ along with not being grouchy all the time. I have lost a little weight as well_ which is nice. The only down side is I now have terrible insomnia.,Taking the brand name is very important_ as opposed to the generic. It's much more expensive_ but worth every penny if you really need it. I have heard so many horror stories about the generic kind. I would recommend this drug to anyone who needs their mood lifted and leveled--I don't know how I ever got on without it.,F,22,3  months,7/13/2009,Wellbutrin xl

The insomnia lasted the longest. I take the med in the am and that does seem to help. I was switched to generic (I was not initially aware)_ and it did not work AT ALL_ it was as though I went off of it cold turkey. I was extremely irritible and had very bad anxiety.  I have to pay a lot for the name brand_ but it is worth every penny. I was relieved to read other have had the same experience with a huge difference in the generic version.

I have only been on this drug for 3weeks and I can't even describe the way I feel. It's horrible!! So now I am out of work so my doctor can wean me off this dangerous drug.

438, 3, Problems with fatigue,After about a week of taking Wellbutrin_ I had a grand mal seizure.  This is not something that is in my family history and I've never had a seizure before.  The doctors can't pin it down 100%_ but they said because of the timing going on this medicine was most likely the cause.  The week when I started it I had a bad headache for a couple of days at the base of my neck_ and had trouble sleeping at night (first night I only slept 3 hrs_ and then each day was able to sleep more).  My left hand would shake a little...not drastic_ but I could notice that I couldn't hold my hand still like I used to be able to.  Felt like I was hopped up on caffeine.,I'm actually very disappointed that I had the seizure because I'm not allowed to take this medicine anymore (because it may cause more seizures in the future) but it REALLY fixed my fatigue problems and the day I had the seizure I was actually feeling especially good...no more headaches_ sleeping on regular hours again and had lots of energy that I hadn't had in months.

Loss of appetite too_ but only slightly. I tried taking it every two days_ but headaches persisted. Interacts badly (almost had a stroke) with Sudafed_ which some MDs won't bother to tell you about. This shouldn't be lightly prescribed in a 10minute diagnosis_ and it's NOT just a better version of prozac like some MDs might tell you.

I even missed thanksgiving dinner because I couldn't eat without having stomach problems. But taking more of my IBS meds helped. That is the only really negative side effect and it went away after the first month. I have been SO much happier and less stressed since being on it. I look at things in a more positive light now.

I was extremely nauseous and lost 9 pounds.,I was prescribed Wellbutrin XL 150_ not some weak imitation.  I pay alot each month for health insurance.  I have no other health issues.

Hair loss was stopped when I started taking Zinc and Selenium (as individual vitamins_ not in multivitamin form.) My eyelashes grew really long! Dr. said that effect of some ADs is to bind with the chemicals in your blood that make up the cross fibers in your hair_ causing breakage which amounts to hair loss.

At first 150 mg Buproprion made me feel crazy_ aggressive_ irritable_ and very anxious.  It led to several arguments with my husband.

I've been on buproprion for about a month and I requested the doctor switch me to 300 mg since my appetite was still pretty high.  I've taken myself off lexapro and am just trying buproprion xl 300 mg and so far I like it.  I've lost 5 pounds and have increased sex drives.  The lexapro was good initially to counter the irritatbility and anxiety of buproprion but now these negative side effects of buproprion appear to have subsided.  Being on 300 mg really helps me with my appetite. I feel very optimistic too.  Just encouragement to others out there_ it took several weeks to a month for my ""crazy"" buproprion side effects to subside. Until they subsided lexapro kept me in check. NOw that they appear to have subsided I am trying myself only on buproprion to see how it will go and so far so good_ much less appetite than lexapro (not as mellow as lexapro) but very happy_ very confidence_ and desire to have sex. So hang in there if you have side effects_ they may subside for you after 4-6 weeks.  Until then you can take a supplemental drug such as lexapro etc to counter the side effects.",F,37,4  weeks,4/19/2009,Wellbutrin xl

Please pay the extra $$ if you can and switch to the name brand.,I have been on 150 mg of generic for 1 month and felt like it was not helping my symptoms.  Was increased to 300mg last week and the anxiety_ jitters_ muscle pain and generalized fatigue are just horrible.

It has helped depression the most but I cannot tolerate the lack of clarity I feel_ and also the affect of alcohol is intensely heightened to point of sudden and scary blackouts on just 3-4 drinks (especially wine)_ thus has damaged relationships; I feel totally ditzy quite often; I am seeing my doctor about switching to Adderall because I've heard and read great things about its affects on depression and alertness in small dosages as long as it's not abused; Wellbutrin has helped depression significantly but I work in education and feel like I can't think straight most of the time; weight loss was very mild but I do think I eat a little less,F,28,2  years,4/12/2009,Wellbutrin xl

Had this from Paxil a few years ago (did not stay on it for long).  I find with the W XL that the edge is taking off my reactions to issues and problems.  Significant reduction in suicide ideation and volatility... more patient... but the ringing in my ears!!  I am worried that this tinnitus won't go away_ once I am eased off the W XL.  Also_ I would like to add that I am still feeling anxious_ less intense but it continues to affect me.  I am considering a small dose of Cipralex_ maybe 5 mg to offset it...

Even my shrink has heard this...he does not argue with this!*,I am nauseous 90% of the time (not even to the point of vomiting to relieve it)_ diarrhea/soft stool_ brain zaps almost *unbearable* to where I cannot function--they make me so damn irritable! The nausea starts_ I chug Coke Zeros to temporarily relieve it---when my stomach can't handle that anymore_ coffee offsets the soda overdose. It is a horrible cycle! If I still worked in an office_ I would have taken so many sick days I'd have been fired by now--I'm thankful I got laid off! All I want to do is lie down and doze off so these shitty side effects would leave me alone! That works for several hours_ I get hungry_ I eat a little something_ the cycle resumes! Lost 14 pounds_ which was badly needed and greatly appreciated_ but this poison is just not worth it!!! The side effects are depressing the hell out of me and intermittently send me into complete despair! I made the STUPID mistake of alternating it with the brand name for FIVE DAYS when I was finally starting to feel better (taking the REAL THING was beginning to work well after about 10 days) to save money and now I want to kill myself---not even because of the depression end of it or suicidal thoughts_ but because of the physical torture!

Also this morning I am having pretty strong menstrual-like cramps although I am not due for it anytime soon. After reading about others having problems with periods on this drug I am going to stop taking it and try to something else. For the second dose to be this powerful just kind of scares me_ even if the symptoms will wear off. I also thought I was catching a cold but then read about flu-like symptoms too. I know it's still to early to determine how this drug will help me_ but after reading about the side effects and what I experienced I am going to ask my dr. if I can try something else. I did well on Celexa about 5 years ago before I got ""immune"" to it and will ask my doctor if I can try that again.

Everything spins and I have to close my eyes and grab on to something.  It is very scary. Also_ this med worked for maybe 3 months max_ but not anymore.

When I first started I was using the Brand name medicine and everything was going really well. I took one month of the Brand name drug but then I was switched to the Teva generic. Things went downhill from there and I went off the drug since all my old symptoms reappeared. Only recently did I read the ConsumerLab report about the generic and now it all makes sense.

For me_ Wellbutrin has been worth the side effects.  On the down side_ Wellbutrin has made me really jumpy and it definitely interferes with sleep significantly.  It also hasn't helped me at all with anxiety_ if anything it made it worse.  HOWEVER.  On the up side_ it has helped A LOT with depression and with my bulimia.  It's amazing that many of my urges and addictive behaviors just disappeared almost like a miracle.  Also_ it doesn't make my hair fall out like many other antidepressants.    I have been taking 150 mg.  I recommend Wellbutrin but caution that you might need other meds to counter the side effects.

I was depressed (2 deaths in family this year_ change of jobs_ and end of an affair)not motivated_ my self esteem was tanking_ no sex drive_ just not happy. I quickly experienced an uplift in my attitude - actually laughing and  being part of family discussions again. I have a lot of energy - always looking for something to do around the house and at work. So i'd say my motivation is up (before starting XL_ all i wanted to do was sleep - didn't want to get up in the mornings).  My sex drive is off the charts.  Mr Wiggle is always ready to go again and me and wife are taking advantage of it as we went 3 months due to my depression.  I just feel good_ i seem happy and I am really glad I went to dr. and he put me on XL. I'm taking 300mg daily.  Good luck to all.,M,42,2  weeks,3/12/2009,Wellbutrin xl

It worked pretty well but she decided to add Wellbutrin XL and it has been good for me.,The Wellbutrin XL was added to the Cymbalta after  I found that I had breast cancer (stage 0)_ surgery_ radiation_ and no chemo but cancer meds that caused weight gain that made the depression worse.

I hope these all go away soon_ except for the loss of appetite_ which is needed_ as I am 50-60 lbs overweight.,This is part of my new cocktail. The other med added at the same time was Topamax_ so I am not sure which side effects belong with which med. I have been on 300mg Lamictal forever; love it. Used Seroquel for sleep. The reason I am now taking Wellbutrin XL (150mg) is for the weight loss and/or libido increase benefits (same goes for the Topamax 25mg). Dumped the Seroquel (25-50mg) and halved the Cymbalta to 60mg as my weight hasn't moved in 4 months even tho' I eat like a rabbit. Since starting these 2 new meds_ I lost a pound or two in 11 days_ but I believe it's mainly due to the GI problems caused by Topamax.,F,40,11  days,2/28/2009Email,Wellbutrin xl

Wellbutrin is an extremely effective medication; the generic manufactured by Teva is worthless. I can't speak to other generic manufacturers (Watson_ for example)_ but I was so dissatisfied that it makes me angry that pharmacies would even stock the Teva brand.

I did start feeling more joy in activities and everyday life_ had an easier time managing my emotions to deal with my depression_ BUT noticed signs of anger and rage that i'd never really experienced before. I have noticed this getting worse actually lately after over a year of taking this medication and I will get furiously angry over nothing and it really is scar because I have never been an angry person. I did try and make an appt. with my psychiatrist but have yet to see him. I did go off of the medication for almost a month and noticed a drastic drop i,F,25,13  months,1/9/2009,Wellbutrin xl

My husband is  VERY disappointed that I missed out on that side effect.,"I started taking Wellbutrin XL 150mg about three months ago. I really wanted this to work. This drug has done nothing to treat my depression. So far all it has done is cause me to lose so much weight that my mother (who lives across the country) started crying when she saw me and said ""What have you DONE to yourself?!"" I weighed 116 when I started taking the drug three months ago. I now weigh 106. I'm still losing weight. Size 00 is roomy on me. This is getting to be a problem. I wouldn't care so much if the drug was helping my mood_ but it's not. I'm still anxiety ridden and totally unmotivated to get out and mix with the world at large.

I found neither increased libido as long as I was still on Lexapro_ but both brands/dosages of Buproprion helped with ADHD issues. I stopped the Lexapro and went back to the 150XL generic - my sex drive returned_ I kept the ADHD benfits_ but lost what I loved about Lexapro. I don't know what 150XL of the brand name is like_ but the generic seems to be fine for me. Also_ I have more energy and wake up 100 times easier than I used too!

I could not help it. After reading others comments I am going to ask for another script for name brand. Since being off the generic the crying has stopped_ but still irritable and very snappy.

520, 5, Depression/GAD,None,I began taking 150mg Wellbutrin fourteen days ago and am pretty impressed with the improvement in my spirits. Before taking the medicine I checked this website and noted many negative reviews_ so I was reluctant to begin taking it. Eventually I rationalized that since most of the negative reviews are from women there may be a gender difference-the men's reviews weren't as bad or as numerous. So I popped the first one with  breakfast and since then my experience hasn't been bad at all. I had been experiencing palpitations_ anxiety and was in a low_ foul mood for quite some time (since I was a kid_ actually). Lately_ I was popping my wife's Ativan like candy. Initially I was given Lexipro but I only took one dose because the side effects were dreadful...rather like an acid trip without the picture show. So far the Wellbutrin hasn't caused any noticable side effects and my mood has lifted; it's as though I have a new outlook on things. I can attend to tasks and stay focused to completion.,M,52,15  days,1/2/2009,Wellbutrin xl

I'm hoping it will return in full. I also am hoping to get the benefit of weight loss from this medication. I have noticed that I am not nearly as fatigued as I was when taking lexapro.

The Effexor was way more helpful with my depression and anxiety disorder- but did nothing to help the attention deficity disorder and the side effects were awful.  Wellbutrin seems to hit the opposite notes-depression is coming back_ as well as the anxiety_ but I'm better able to focus and stay on task.  I feel constantly irritable_ though_ and I feel dread of the future.  I've been trying to just live moment to moment rather than think of the future.

Felt I needed it again_ so my Dr. initially prescribed Lexipro.  I did NOT like Lexipro at all and switched to Wellbutrin after 13 days.  Lexipro left me feeling like a zombie with zero initiative.  Caused severe dizziness and headaches.  My pharmacy initially gave me Budeprion XL (generic Wellbutrin).  Almost immediately_ I had fits of uncontrollable rage and anger.  I did not realize it was because of the generic Budeprion until I went on line and read several other reviews of people experiencing the same thing.  I quickly switched to the brand name Wellbutrin XL and my emotional episodes subsided.  At first I had trouble going to sleep at night_ but I take the Wellbutrin (150 mg) early in the morning and now have no trouble getting to sleep.  It has definitely increased my energy level and lowered my craving for food.,F,50,2  months,12/28/2008,Wellbutrin xl

After ruling out anything physical my NP prescribed Lexipro: it was awful...yawns_ sweats_ chills_ hyper feeling_ tachycardia and palpitations increased. I imagine it to be comparable to an acid trip without the picture show!  I took only one dose and returned to the office to get another scirip. I was given Wellbutrin XL and came to this site to read all the comments. I was reluctant to begin the medication because of what I read on this page (I took note that men reported fewer problems with this medication) but decided to bite the bullet_ as it were.

527, 5, Depression,Headaches_ weight loss_ increased libido,I was originally on Prozac for depression and that helped the irritability that accompanies my episodes. However_ I was still about as motivated as a rock and had ZERO interest in intimacy with hubby (not even cuddling!) The doc I saw added Wellbutrin XL to my regimen and lowered my dose of Prozac to 10mg. He informed me that while Prozac was very good at evening out your moods_ Wellbutrin was much better if your trouble was lack of motivation. But since my depression is coupled with a tendency for yelling at loved ones (very unlike me usually) he kept me on the Prozac so I wouldn't be more motivated to yell at everyone! The combination was nothing short of miraculous for me - I finally got my house clean_ lost weight_ got interested in hubby again_ had fun with my kids. I write this because I read some reviews that could scare someone away from using Wellbutrin XL. I know its not for everyone_ but sometimes a good doc can tweak your dosages or drug combinations to find the right fit,F,35,10  months,12/17/2008,Wellbutrin xl

I easily lost 15 lbs. (I am 5'5'' 120 lbs. now). I plan to continue taking wellbutrin for quite some time. I did try the generic for a while_ but I do believe that it is not as effective (different release rates?). Stick to the name brand if you can afford it. It is worth it_ believe me.

DO NOT TAKE BUDEPRION MADE BY TEVA!!!! DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE TELLING YOU IT IS THE SAME AS THE BRAND NAME!!! It is total crap and made me worse. Not the thing to take for postpartum depression or anything! This should be removed from the market immediately! It is NOT worth the price difference (though huge) for generic.

The generics work but not as well as the Brand names.While taking Wellbutrin XL I had headaches at the very beginning_ dry mouth and dizziness. I had to take it with food or my stomach would be upset. The major side effect I was worried about was the slight depression. Considering I already suffer from S.A.D. However_ recognizing this I talked to my family and friends. I don't believe the Wellbutrin XL caused the slight depression. I believe it was the lack of nicotine. Your mind will do (or try to tell you) anything to try and get you to have that smoke. With will power and support from family and friends I was able to overcome this side effect.If you are thinking of taking Wellbutrin XL I would support your decision but would also keep a close eye on you for side effects.

I'm 27 and VERY fit---I do triathlons_ however_ I now have dangerously high blood pressure from taking Wellbutrin for the first time in my life.  Normally my blood pressure is in the extremely low range. In addition_ the constipation was SEVERE---I was lucky to have a bowel movement once every 6 days.  The insomnia I experienced was awful---I could make my body sleep for only about 3 hours a night tops.  ****My advice to anyone with preexisting concerns about blood pressure is to NOT take this medication and if you are_ then monitor your health closely.****",F,27,7  months,11/7/2008Email,Wellbutrin xl

Then_ up to 150 mg. But I seem to be experiencing the opposite of what I should be...No loss of appetite_ not feeling better (perhaps worse). I had only slight nausea at the beginning of both dosages; hardly any side effects at all compared to the other crazy drugs I've taken. I am on the generic and I see now from this column that I might do better on the brand.  Only been on 150 mg for about 2 weeks now; I guess I'll stick it out and give it a chance_ but...not helping thus far. It is really my last hope drug for depression.

There was a sort of jittery feeling when first starting_ but that passes quickly_ and the results have been what my doctor calls 'remarkable'.,The difference in my mood--in my life!--was noticeable in the first few weeks.  I was up_ out_ moving.........the grey fog was gone. Although I had forgotten what 'myself' felt like_ I recognized that I was much more clear-headed and productive.  However_ because of insurance regualtions_ I switched to the generic of Wellbutrin XL....and almost immediately noticed a difference.  After six weeks on the generic_ I simply stopped taking it because it just was not working anymore.  No matter what the pharmacist may tell you_ the difference in the brand vs. the generic was marked.  I was able to negotiate with my insurance company and am now back on brand.  I say this_ because I truly believe if you start with the generic you will not have the same results.,F,50,14  months,10/30/2008,Wellbutrin xl

However_ it has not done lots to improve my anxiety disorder. I am currently on a dose of 150mg per day_ and my family dr. has suggested that I increase the dose to 300mg a day to conquer the anxiety symptoms I am still having. I am reluctant to increase the dosage as it was my understanding that this is more for depression than anxiety. Any thoughts? has anyone out there received benefits in the area of anxiety by increasing the dose from 150mg to 300mg? I personally don't want to go thru the insomnia and other side effects I experienced when first getting on this medication.

I continued thinking this for about six months until I finally said forget it.  I asked my doc to switch me to something else because this drug wasn't working anymore.  I continued to still feel myself that it was generic form of drug that wasn't working.  I recently read an article that indeed many people are finding the generic form of this drug just doesn't work the same!  After taking Cymbalta for awhile with minimal results_ I've asked to be switched back to Wellbutrin and will only take the name brand.

On the plus side I also have not experienced any insomnia and have actually slept just fine.

This does seem to be the perfect combination to beat back both the emotional and cognitive aspects of my depression. I would say that like most ADs it has a very dramatic lifting effect in the beginning which tapers off over time to a less noticeable and more manageable level.For example_ the first few weeks saw me out of the bed at very early hours and compulsively doing housework. Now I just get a little lift in the morning that get me out of bed at a normal hour and I don't feel the need to be a workaholic all the time. I haven't had seriously negative thoughts for a long time_ although occasionally I feel it isn't working as well as it should. However when I try to reduce the dosage of either drug_ over time negative thoughts and slowed thinking takes over my mind gradually.

My hair has been slowing thinning over the past 20 years_ but it certainly got worse after starting Wellbutrin. I will stop taking the medication and hope my recently lost hair grows back. The benefits of Wellbutrin don't make up for the increased depression caused by this hair loss. I also experienced increased hair loss with Zoloft. I know the experts say that only a very small percentage of patients experience hair loss while taking Wellbutrin. In my opinion_ people with normally thick hair won't notice if they're losing any hair. I think you have to lose about 50% of your hair before noticing any marked difference in thickness.

The initial side effects were brain flashes from Lexapro withdrawal. The only Wellbutrin side effect was weight loss- about 3 lbs per week. Eventually_ I lost 40 lbs in 3 months and then my weight stabilized. This has been a good side effect since it motivated me to return to regular exercise and better eating habits.,Wellbutrin has been very good for me. It has greatly reduced my depression and anger. It also has enabled me to become more focused at work. I went from an under performer to an over performer. At my last review_ my boss commented on the change and wondered why. I did not tell her it's Wellbutrin. My wife also knows that she does not have to worry about me becoming angry for irrational reasons. I recently tried a generic form of Wellbutrin XL manufactured by Anchen because the brand name was not available.

594, 4, depression,significant weight loss.  forgot about eating all the time.,I have been taking anti depressants for over 20 years.  this one has the fewest adverse side affects for me_ no loss of interest in sex_ definitely no weight gain.  felt lousy on 150mg initially_ so we jumped to max dosage_ 450mg_ and it worked. I feel good most of the time. I've come to realize there is no magic pill that makes you feel terrific all the time.,M,57,4  years,7/29/2008,Wellbutrin xl
595, 5, Anxiety_ Depression_ OCD,I've just started taking it this morning. I've gone off Lexapro 20mg daily_ which I had been on for about 3 years. It's effectiveness was wearing off_ and the side effects (less libido_ excessive sweating_ and inability to feel emotions) were too much.I've been off the Lexapro for about 3 weeks now. I'm feeling better this morning_ which is counterintuitive since it takes quite a while for these to have much of an effect. Well_ even if it's psychosomatic_ I'll take what I can get!I will keep this site updated as I progress.,I'm a little worried because I've been given the TEVA generic.

596, 5, Extreme Depression,Only side effect was weight loss.,The weight loss was a good side effect because 1/3 of the depression was from weight gain.

Have been on Wellbutrin XL for 3 yrs.,F,44,3  years,7/25/2008,Wellbutrin xl

Definitely helped even out my mood and temper (though I still had some irritability/anger issues)_ and without many of the negative side effects (e.g. sedation_ sexual side effects) caused by many other antidepressants.  Doesn't do much for anxiety_ however.  Had to stop taking as it was too expensive and not covered by my insurance.,M,30,3  years,7/24/2008Email,Wellbutrin xl

600, 4, major depression,loss of appetite_ insomnia_ muscle tension,When I started taking Wellbutrin_ I was suicidal. In a couple of days_ I felt wonderful--almost euphoric. It kicked in quickly and gave me more energy than I think I've ever had_ but the loss of appetite and insomnia were hard to deal with. I was already underweight from depression_ and already had trouble sleeping. On Wellbutrin alone_ I'd take 2 or 3 times my max dose of Lunesta_ and still sleep only a few hours. After a couple of weeks this began to catch up with me and I'd have a few days of crying all the time. My doctor added Zoloft and the combination has been great. They seem to offset each other's side effects. Usually I still have to take something to sleep but it will work for 8 or 9 hours_ and my appetite is good. Antidepressants have been a lifesaver for me.

So ha!,Does depression cause anxiety or anxiety cause depression?!?  I have struggled with this question for years and never felt medication was an advisable treatment option.  I am recovering drug addict so scared by any type Rx treatment.  BUT I felt immediate relief the first day!  Started at 150mg for first few days and then jumped to 300mg on day 4.  Day 4-7 was rough in the anxiety department as it was definitely heightened but I just stuck it out.  On Day 10_ all SE diminished and felt like I was in the groove.

Did not have constipation with the 150mg but did with the 300mg.  I really do not want to have to stop WXL.  It has really  helped with my moodiness and feeling angry all the time.  My kids seem happier because I am not getting angry over little things (like a wet floor after bathtime). I was leaving work everyday with a headache and since starting WXL I leave work with no headache and a smile on my face which is very unusal for me.

I am now taking the generic brand and i am beginning to think that the more expensive drug is the way to go.  I am going to keep trying this drug for the next month and see what happens.  I think 300mg's is to much_ but my doctor says it can take up to two months to see the benefits.  No more caffeine_ don't need it.  Still smoking but is drastically less_ some times it makes me naucious_ down to three or four a day.

Seizure was on everything I read. I already have tinnitus didn't want worse. SSRIs have done nothing other than make me feel tired and spaced out. I decided last week to give this a try. Doc didn't start me on 150mg which is normal before going to 300 and I was edgy all day_(took it about 10AM) couldn't sleep that night. Didn't make it to work until noon. Called Doc and he dropped it to 150mg.I skipped a day then took the 150 and had little side effects. I've only been on it 4 days so I can't give an accurate report yet. Insomnia always been a problem anyway_ I took 1mg of Xanax at bedtime last night and slept fine. Took the WXL150 this morning and felt nothing good or bad. I'll rinse and repeat so to speak. I have to stay out of town for work which stresses me when starting a new med. I probably shouldn't jump up to 300mg. My doc just said see how it goes.

Doc said this was common. After a week on the higher dose_ I would experience bouts of extreme anger and rage randomly with no reason.  I was so upset becuase this drug eliminated my anxiety and depression and gave me so much energy! The other nice surprise was that unlike what I expected_ I had an INCREASE in libido and my orgasms were so satisfying and intense.

620, 2, Anxiety / Grief-induced Depression,Extreme agitation_ nervousness_ paranoia_ insomnia_ increased anxiety_ foul breath/taste in mouth,I had a very bad reaction to Wellbutrin on 150 for 3 weeks. I think it is very important to note that my therapist believes I had the reaction I did because I had more of an anxiety-rooted problem than depression. Wellbutrin seems to be better tolerated by people with depression disorders rather than anxiety disorders_ and acted almost like an amphetamine in my system. I am going to try an SSRI soon and hope that helps. The side effects I had are like nothing I have ever experienced in my life: I woke up every morning at 4AM on the nose in an almost manic state of anxiety. I felt very paranoid and manic inside_ frightened all the time (not my normal anxiety). I almost felt like I was losing my mind. I thought I was literally going insane_ the anxiety and agitation was so severe. I did lose weight and curb smoking but it wasn't worth the suffering of the side effects. I highly recommend questioning this prescription for anxiety rooted problems as opposed to depression.,F,36,21  days,5/27/2008,Wellbutrin xl

At around day four I started to experience numbness in my face and random feelings of extreme weakness/dizziness that lasted about two seconds. I'm on day seven right now and am experiencing extreme exhaustion. I walked up three flights of stairs earlier today and felt like I was going to collapse after.

Have never had a thought of suicide while on this medicine_ because it lifts me up so much: it makes me ME again. No other antidepressant has been able to match Wellbutrin XL's lifesaving effects. My doctor mentioned that I should never try the generic because studies have shown that it doesn't work as well as the name brand_ so now that the generic is often substituted in American pharmacies I buy this from a pharmacy in Canada. Canadian cost is 1/3 the price of how much I pay with insurance in the US!Every once in a while when the medication at 300mg is too much_ my doctor reduces the amount to 150mg and vice versa if I'm needing more medication.

Lexapro made it suck.  Although my sex drive was great from the Wellbutrin xl_ I could not climax AT ALL. That left me way too sexually frustrated.

But on the sixth day_ I did not get a headache_ and I haven't had one since.  I am now on my 14th day of WXL and still no headaches.,This has made a tremendous change in my life.  Just before WXL I was put on Lyrica_ which has helped me greatly.  I have been on narcotics for quite a while now.  To sum things up_ everything I am taking makes me tired all the time and so sleepy that I will actually leave work early so I can go home and get in the bed.  Going to bed was constantly on my mind.  Now with the WXL_ all that sleepiness has disappeared!  I am so energetic!  I_ obviously_ have a chronic pain situation_ so that in itself makes you not want to run around with children or play a game of HORSE or go skating with your child and actually skate instead of sitting on the benches waiting for the time to come so you can go home and get in the bed.  I am serious. All I cared about was going to sleep.  Now_ I do not long for sleep and my mind is not consumed with laying down.  Thank you to the makers of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.

After the first few days of taking the drug I noticed a bit of insomnia. I just wasn't tired. I started going to bed when I would normally and just lay there. After about 20-30 minutes I would fall asleep. However after two weeks of taking it the effect is lessening. It has really helped me out however by giving me an increased amount of energy and motivation. The way I have been describing it to some people is saying ""You know how people used to tell you that you can be whatever you want to be? Well I actually feel like thats true now."" Great drug. The drug has also given me a huge increase in sexual desire. Which_ I love. Sadly_ my girlfriend gets tired of it. Also I used to eat out of border sometimes. I no longer have this desire.

I still have more motivation_ but the changes I was looking for in the increased dosage haven't happened yet...,Prior to taking WXL 150 I was on Paxil which caused me to gain weight and loose my sex drive... not pleasant. It had bad withdraw effects so it took me awhile to completely come off of it_ but I'm so glad I did. Wellbutrin has made such a difference.

I noticed my heart racing and an overall sense of jitteriness_ I will have to cut down on coffee. I am an asthmatic that has been on and off Prednisone (which packs on the pounds) for about 4 years now so am not too concerned about the loss of appetite_ if I lose the extra 20 lbs._ that would be fine.

651, 4, major depression,insomnia_ easily aggitated,I took zoloft for 2yrs. It helped at first with the depression but I gained 40lbs in the meantime. I have always been a fairly small person and the weight gain just made me even more depressed. Getting off of the zoloft was hard but I don't think I experienced as bad of side effects as some...no brain zaps or anything like that. I tried to just go all natural supplements and it was ok_ but I knew it wasn't enough. So unfortunetly I had to get back on something. The wellbutrin has given me more energy than I have had in a long time. Zoloft kept me sooo tired. I've been on the wellbutrin just a short time but I have really high hopes.

Pretty much all the side affects went away. My appetite is normal now which i didnt want_ i liked losing the weight so quick. Don't drink coffee!

Within the first 6 months I dropped over 25lbs. effortlessly.  It made me not want to eat as much which was a good thing.  I had gained a lot of weight from being depressed in the past.  I stopped it when I got pregnant a year later.  I've done fairly well off of it_ but I'm about to start it again.  I'm hoping I'll see the weight loss again because I've unfortunately gained about 20lbs since stopping it.,F,27,1  years,3/26/2008,Wellbutrin xl

I've probably said it thousands of times now (out loud when I'm alone) and each time it shocks me and make me feel guilty.  This is a bizarre change in my behaviour.  Very weird dreams.  Overtalking and rapid talking.  Sometimes feel shakey.",Increased energy.  It's the only depression med that didn't make me sleep all day.  I actually wake up at normal times and for the most part do not nap most days.  I also masterbate more often_ so I guess the sex drive is increased.  Appetite seems to go in phases. I either eat more food for months or don't eat alot of food for months.,F,43,9  months,3/15/2008,Wellbutrin xl

658, 3, severe depression_ anxiety,While on 300mg Wellbutrin XL + 25mg Zoloft_ I experienced irritability_ mood swings_ twitching (but only when I drank too much coffee)_ dull headaches that got worse over time_ and constipation.,I was originally put on Zoloft 25mg for seven days_ which increased to 50mg thereafter.  Both strengths of Zoloft made me groggy_ blah_ and low libido.  So my OB switched me to Wellbutrin XL and told me that I needed to wean off the Zoloft by going back to 25mg for six days.  She prescribed 60 tablets of 150mg Wellbutrin XL and advised me that I could take two at the same time (300mg) while weaning off the Zoloft if I needed to.  So I decided to do just that_ and this might have been where all the side effects came to play_ to start with 300mg Wellbutrin XL and 25mg Zoloft for five days.  I quit the Zoloft one day early because it was just too much.  Hopefully I'm weaned off of that Zoloft by now.  Anyway_ today I decided (day six) that I would only do 150mg Wellbutrin XL in the morning... don't know if it's making a difference yet because I still have the headaches and constipation_ the irritability has subsided.  But I do feel like the Wellbutrin XL 150mg is helping my depression a l,F,27,6  days,3/13/2008,Wellbutrin xl

660, 4, Depression,brain fogginess - someone could say something to me and it sounded like a different language - anxiety and a bit of extra hair loss_ vivid dreams and trouble staying asleep,Wellbutrin has been great for me.  It's not like other antidepressants because there is no loss of libido and not much weight gain.  Other drugs I've tried have made me emotionless which I suppose is ok but it's nice to have feelings sometimes.  Wellbutrin takes the edge off.  The only troubling side effect is the brain fog...occassionally I'll have to ask people to repeat themselves 5 or 6 times before I make out what they're saying.  Sort of just has the Charlie Brown teacher effect.  It's frustrating but otherwise I like this drug and don't expect to be getting off of it for quite some time.,F,27,9  months,3/8/2008,Wellbutrin xl
661, 3, depression,dry mouth_ loss of taste_ constipation_ tiredness_ loss of appetite (at first)_ twitching limbs,I am taking both Wellbutrin XL (300) and Zoloft (50)_ which I am on for depression and an eating disorder.  Zoloft at a higher dose made me sleep all the time so the doctor added Wellbutrin.  I liked Wellbutrin at first because I had a loss of appetite and lost a few pounds.  After a few months_ however_ I noticed a weight gain.  In the year that I've been on both Wellbutrin and Zoloft I've gained about 30 pounds even though I track calories and exercise.  I'm also quite tired_ although not as bad as when I was on a higher dose of Zoloft_ and constipated.  I have also noticed that my legs twitch and I have a decrease in my senses (smelling and taste).,F,24,1  years,3/7/2008Email,Wellbutrin xl
662, 4, Chronic/severe Depression,tremmors_ a little anxiety_ weight loss (yay)_ dizzyness,I switched to wellburtin after being on paxil for about 3 or 4 years. The paxil started to become ineffective_ and i gained about 35 lbs. on it_ not fun for a teenager. The wellbutrin took a while to get into_ my dr started me out really slow_ and the tremmors were pretty bad at first. But if anyone is just starting out on this drug i say give it at least 2 months and expect that the side effects will stick around until you've reached the dose your going to stay at. But unless you are having major debilitating side effects_ at least give it a change_ it'll get better. One thing i want to note_ they switched me to the generic buprobion or whatever when it finally came out...it was a bad point in my life anyway were is was struggling with a lot of family stuff_ and i just thought my depression was getting worse_ and the anxiety was worse_ etc. My dr. switched me back to brand name_ and I started feeling better again_ more energy_ happier_ dealing with things a lot better_ less anger_ ect,F,25,6  years,3/5/2008,Wellbutrin xl

I started Wellbutrin SR 100mg while still on Prozac 40mg -- BAD IDEA!  I felt like I was on speed -- four hours of sleep and I couldn't stop talking or moving or feeling really really fine.  Apparently too much stimulant at once for me.I'm now on 300mg WXL and maybe getting a light rash on the backs of my hands.  I'm also taking Ambien 5mg at night.  I think this drug combo_ and a really good therapist_ are the reasons I'm finally getting better slowly.  I was told that Wellbutrin might cut my appetite for caffeine and alcohol -- it definitely has.  I just don't ""need"" either one anymore.",F,24, ,3/5/2008,Wellbutrin xl

I've been on this med for a year and a half.  I have much more energy_ am more alert_ and can concentrate at work.  I do get depressed and anxious when I have PMS_ but it's not terrible.  No sexual side effects.  Maybe too much weight loss and lack of hunger_ so this med isn't for anorexics.  Helps more with energy than anything else.  Highly recommended for those who can't get out of bed (me)_ but not recommended for people with anxiety only.  I'll probably be on this life long.,F,28,1.5  years,2/28/2008,Wellbutrin xl

I had taking Wellburin in the past and felt great_ wanted sex and could have an orgasm with no problems (which were intense)_ but I decided to wean off them for a bit. My doctor recently put me on Lexapro 20 mg but the low sex drive and difficulty having an orgasm was driving me crazy.  So my doctor added WB XL and nothing changed. So I weaned off the Lexapro and am only taking the WB XL but I am still having difficuty having an orgasm and still not feeling much better. Does it take a while to get that sensation back?

Seemed to work at first_ but now after 3 months it seems like I am taking nothing but Celexa. I cannot increase Celexa dose because 40mgs made me dizzy and sleepy all the time. Appears only to have affected my social anxiety_ as I seem to be able to act naturally without agonizing over whether I looked or sounded like an idiot. I do_ however_ want to feel a whole lot happier than this--I have nothing to feel unhappy about.

There are special toothpastes_ mouthwashes_ sprays_ and gums for dry mouth that help lessen the discomfort.  I am taking 300 MG daily of Wellbutrin XL.

Dry mouth and trouble sleeping to name two. However_ I have noticed a major decrease in appetite. I'm thinking I'm down about 7-8 lbs in almost 2 weeks.

I rejected this drug for a year after trying it at 150 milligrams_ due to highly unpleasant side effects such as high anxiety_ dehydration_ sleeplessness. It was the first and only drug I tried for depression. Finally_ I tried again at 100 mg.  What a difference!  Then I went up to a second 100 mg. in the pm_ but took it too late and it disturbed my sleep.  Sometimes I take one around 4:00_ sometimes I don't take a pm one.  I still have twitching and some anxiety (I agree that caffeine needs to be reduced). Its not perfect all the time_ but overall my life has greatly improved.

Ive been on it for 4 of the seven. So far Ive been pretty leveled out with my moods. I have had a problem with a constant_ small headache. I have felt jittery_ and have completely forgot what I was saying at times. From what I have read_ these side effects seem to go away after time.

729, 5, Major Depression/weight loss/ADHD,Upset stomach_ mild head aches_ general constipation_ and mild nausea.. All of these side effects have gone away except for the weight loss that has persisted. (Thank god),Avoid generic Wellbutrin XL especially if you are allergic to dyes or have had headaches due to caffeine and wellbutrin XL (generic). The brand-name Wellbutrin XL I take at 450mg dose_ does not have that caffeine-headache/reaction that you would get with the generic medication. Wellbutrin worked great for my depression_ I still get a little depressed at times_ but thats life. The weight loss has done alot to increase my self esteme_ so I would like to maintain that at any end.,M,29,11  months,11/19/2007,Wellbutrin xl

It certainly helped me get out of bed in the morning and gave me more energy and drive to get things done.  However_ there are days where my feelings of anxiety about things are much more intense than before_ I seem to compusively dwell on my recent break-up.  Seems to dull the effects of alcohol but hangovers are worse_ wouldnt recommend alcohol.

It made me feel more energetic (I used to sleep ALL day now I walk 3 miles a day instead) and my overall attitude towards life is just better. I am assuming the side effects are all due to me not being able to eat because the thought of food makes me want to gag. I still eat so I wont pass out but I do not like the diarrhea and stomach burning but im sure this can be cured if I force myself to eat with the medicine.,F,22,14  days,11/14/2007,Wellbutrin xl

My depression disappeared and generally am alot happier and able to deal with life alot better. Decided to switch from effexor xr to wellbutrin because of weight gain and feeling tired all the time. Let's see how it goes. Just to let everyone know who is starting a new antidepressant or switching over to a new one. You must give it time. You might get horrible side effects for the first few weeks when starting a new drug_ you may even get worse before you get better. When I first started lexapro and effexor xr for the first time years ago the first few weeks I thought the world was coming to an end_ but things got much better.

I eat probably 3 times more then i did before and yet i'm 15-20 pounds lighter then I was before takeing Wellbutrin XL.,It's great for weight loss_ not good to take if you are an anxious person or are prone to anxiety attacks.

Still feeling a little flat in the energy department and in mood_ Dr. increased from 150 to 300 today_ we'll see if that helps. Don't give up if you're looking for help!!

It causes extreme loss of appetite for me (and consequently weight loss).  I feel almost like I took speed--the first few nights_ I was up all night cleaning.  I also had some of the WORST panic attacks of my life while on this medicine with racing thoughts_ depersonalization. I totally thought I was going crazy and losing it.  It's not that I wouldn't recommend this drug_ as it's been effective for many people.  I just wouldn't recommend it to someone who has panic disorder or anxiety as I think it stimulates that.,F,25, ,11/11/2007,Wellbutrin xl

Regarding ED_ I've lost the ability to get rigid at all yet I still have a healthy sex drive- How ironic; I take a med for depression and then I can't get it up which leads to feeling depressed. I often feel anxious; more so in public. Low self esteem.,I've been on Wellbutrin some 8 months. It did slowly bring me out of a bad depression; but now I'm dealing with the side-effects to the left_ which is obviously not going to increase my happiness. I'm taking 450mg/day and my Dr has yet to increase/decrease/DC it despite reporting all the side-effects. Get this; and the Dr has no eplanation.

I did not dread going and was happy while I was there. But this rash started to develop on my chest and I didn't know what it was from. The doctor gave me antibiotics and birth control pills for the acne and PMDD. But after reading here_ I now know that the WXL is the cause. It is a hard decision_ but anything that is affecting my body this badly can't be good. It's sad too cuz I thought I finally found something that worked for me.

When I first started taking it_ I shook really badly all the time. Whenever I tried to eat_ my head would shake_ which was probably the most annoying part of that experience. That has calmed down quite a bit within the last two weeks_ though it's not completely gone. In its place_ I am now experiencing an elevated pulse rate (95-105 when calm) along with some rather severe chest pains. Seeing as how I'm used to chest pain (sternum/cartilage issues)_ I really didn't think all that much about it at first_ but it's getting progressively worse. I'll not hit so much on the constipation_ but I'll say that it isn't anywhere near severe_ so it's not really so much an issue.That was the bad stuff.

So I took other meds to counteract the effects_ this led to more side effects. I am now in an intense outpatient treatment program for anorexia.

Had trouble sleeping at first.,I started off on a low dosage_ 75 mg/day for a month then started taking 75 mg twice a day for another month and then increased to one 150 mg XL tablet a day.  Initially the drug made me feel anxious but I was told this feeling would taper off and it did.  Wellbutrin made me more sensitive to other drugs like alcohol_ caffeine and all sleeping pills.  I was more irritable and easy to anger initially_ but these symptoms went away after 6 weeks and after I stopped taking Lunesta and Ambien.  It took 2 months to feel any benefits from this medication but now I feel really good.  My doctor told me Wellbutrin could take up to 3 months to kick in and he was right.  Before Wellbutrin I didn't want to do anything but now I am working out and have a social life again. I know Wellbutrin has helped me a great deal and I no longer suffer from any negative side effects now that my body is used to it.

I know that this ""rush"" of energy is a side effect_ and that it will even out in a few days_ but I was very surprised and happy to find I could get results with only 1/4 of the normal starting dose. I've tried the SR_ and it made me nauseous and left a horrible taste in my mouth_ so I was pleasantly surprised to find that even a cut XL tablet is easy to digest_ with no nausea or aftertaste. When I went on wellbutrin the first time I felt like I was on speed for the first few days_ but on 1/4 of the standard 150 mg starting dose I just felt a pleasant increase in energy.

Day two VERY tired_ can hardly stay awake and I have a neck and back ache.  I love the fact that am not hungry all day. The doctor wants me to start on 300 mg after the first week.

Now_ after two weeks at the higher dose (450mg) I am experiencing more bouts of depression and anxiety. I am trying to look at it objectively_ hoping that things will improve. I switched from Celexa to Wellbrtrin XL because the Celexa was affecting my sex drive. On the plus side I find I am having no problem sticking to a new diet and exercise program. On the negative side I seem to tear up easily. I find it quite suprising that something that is supposed to help can have so many adverse side effects.

But alas_ nine months of taking 150_ and Im graduating to 300 starting tomorrow. The usual effects for me are that I have to take it at the same time every day or my alertness routine is thrown off. I can count on doing great all morning and then hitting a brick wall around 1:30pm. After a short couch nap_ I feel more refreshed. I still tend to be moody/snappy_ but after so long_ I can beware of how Im feeling and try and curb it.  The WORST side effect_ guys_ luckily you wont have to deal with this part_ my period! Emotionally a wreck PMS and then better_ but then physically a wreck for a few days. Major heavy flow. (sorry so descriptive guys) but wanted to forewarn. Upside_ libido is great.

I also had a little bit of trouble sleeping_ and had very vivid dreams for the first week_ but this also went away.  I noticed a marked improvement in my depression within a week (but I was also beginning cognitive and behavioral therapy_ so the fast effect might have had to do with combined therapy).,I was really reluctant to start taking antidepressants_ and began Wellbutrin only after EXHAUSTIVE research (I am a medical student.) I ended up choosing wellbutrin with my doctor because I wanted to avoid the weight gain and depressed libido that are often associated with SSRIs. I cannot begin to express how much this medication has positively affected my life. My depression is now well-controlled_ and I feel like myself again.  The positive side effects are wonderful.  I lost 5 pounds in the first month_ felt like I had more energy_ and my libido came back in full force_ to the great relief of my boyfriend. The antidepressant quality is subtle in that I don't think it changes the way I feel in general (I still have a normal range of emotions) so much as it takes away the irrational intractable sadness that I struggled with for so many years.,F,26,2  months,6/4/2007,Wellbutrin xl

I wasn't a 100%_ but I could imagine a future that I wanted to be a part of for the first time. I was able to recognize the precursor's of bad spells_ and stop myself from wallowing in them. I say WAS because my doctor in an effort to ease the burden of cost for me_ prescribed the generic form called Budeprion XL. I've started to revert_ it's been gradual and I of course have been blaming myself. My doctor decided that maybe a combination of Lexapro with the Budeprion might be best... so in researching this Lexapro (yikes!) I've seen numerous postings regarding generic Wellbutrin and the returning of depression symptoms.

I have been on lexapro for 6 mths and I love it but I can't stop eating and have gained 21 lbs.  Dr said wellbutrin xl would counteract my hunger cravings.  I love the way I feel right after taking the wellbutrin_ but about 4 hours later I crash and want to sleep.  At night I feel like I can feel my heart beating weird and can't sleep.  I take 1 mg of xanax to calm me down and it does help_ but I get the munchies after that.  Seems like a cath 20/20. I figure I should stick to it for at least 1 week and see if my body response changes.  Does Anybody have any input or suggestions or at least experiencing any of the same conditions_ please let me know.,F,33,3  days,5/7/2007Email,Wellbutrin xl

I could not sleep_ I was thinking horrible things_ I cried_ felt physically horrible_ and was turned into a paranoid/hypochondriac. I was slightly depressed before Wellbutrin XL and VERY occasionally prone to panic attacks and this sent me spiralling into both full swing. When i weaned off the med_ it took almost two weeks for all of the effects to go away although I felt emotionally better in a few days. I gained 6 pounds immediately after going off too. I know this med works for lots of people though. i would just carefully monitor myself when going on any antidepressant now.

Now the taste of coffee makes me nauseous and I don't even want it anymore and don't miss it.,I did feel really emotional the first few days of taking it_ but that could be related to coming off the Celexa that I had been on for almost 10 years.

I took it upon myself to stop the med and it went away.,"The vertigo was so bad on Wellbutrin that I would have to crawl to the bathroom. It mad working pretty difficult as the whole world would spin 5-10 times a day. These spells lasted for a day but weeks apart. The doctor sent me for all kinds of tests because the ""book"" didn't list severe vertigo as a side effect. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of this drug creating vertigo and if so_ ask them to ween you off of it. Otherwise_ the drug worked wonderfully.

Dry mouth is really annoying and the shortness of breath a bit scary but this side effect seems to be tapering off. I mentioned to my Dr. that we were wanting to get pregnant and she said the benefits of WellXL out weigh the risks.

My doctor decided to add the Wellbutrin in to help regain my sex drive since the Paxil made me have absolutely none! The risk of seizures scares me tho_ I drink maybe twice a month to the point of being pretty intoxicated. I wondered if anyone had any experiences with drinking and being on this or these drugs.

890, 3, Depression/Social Anxiety,Couldn't sleep at all on the first night that I took the medication but I still felt good that night and throughout the entire second day. Since then every night of sleep has been just fine (7-9 hours). Occasional slight headache but not really a problem. Occasional mild upset stomach 20-45 minutes after ingesting medication. Weight loss: went from 169 lbs. to 165 in 1 week while maintaining a normal diet and normal appetite. I've maintained approx. 170 pounds for the last four years so 165 is not typical for me. Though not a listed side affect I did experience drowsiness during the middle of some days_ which is not typical for me (when not medicated). I believe the weightloss is due to an increase in physical exertion and therefore can produce a fat burning effect within the body. Increased metabolism.,I've been taking Wellbutrin SR (75mg) twice a day (total of 150mg/day) for 13 days now and have experienced mixed effects. For the first 3 days I felt a high amount of energy from 6 am to 11 pm. The feeling was similar to that of caffeine but without the jitters and without the crash or come down. I was talking a lot but in a good way. It was a great feeling_ one that I'd like to feel all day every day. On the 4th day I felt drowsy all day long and did not have that same energy as the first 3 days. Since then I have only felt that energy on two or three occasions and am still experiencing my feelings of depression. I'm hoping that the energetic feeling will be consistent once the medication saturates my system (2-4 weeks?). I believe I will eventually increase my dose and move to Wellbutrin XL. Once a day treatment will be much more convienient too.,M,261,13  days,4/24/2007,Wellbutrin xl

892, 4, Depression,Dry mouth and increased thirst. Increased sex drive for the first 8-9 months or so_ decreasing now but may not be related to W-XL_ other marital issues still exist. Agitation had increased since starting this medicine but seems to be somewhat subsiding now_ agitation still pops up over small issues from time to time_ esp w/family.,Worked up to taking 450mg/day_ and I am glad I did. Been on that dose for about 6 months now. Dry mouth and thirst is a small price to pay considering the benefits for me. I have  a marked decrease in suicidal thoughts_ used to be nearly hourly and quite detailed_ now just about a half dozen thoughts/day and those don't last but for a very brief period. Also taking Trazadone (150mg/night) to aid in maintaining W-XL effects and increase sleeping patterns_ according to my psychologist sleep deprivation is a major contributor to depression and_ after experiencing a few weeks of fairly good sleep I have to agree that deep sleep helped me a lot_ so has counseling. I never thought of myself as the kind of guy who would gain anything from counseling_ but if you are open and honest with a good psycotherapist_ it really does help.

It brought me here and I read everyone's comments every couple days up until about two weeks ago.  This site really helped me stay with the medicine and not give up too early.  I must say it was difficult_ but I am happy I did.  I read a few people stating that you should really give it 4-6 weeks before giving up.  I believe that to be SO true.  I didn't have all symptoms at exactly the same time...the first two weeks were HORRIBLE.  The symptoms would come and go.

I have not been able to drive since my 1st seizure (not that I have my own car--I was using my fiancee's car) and that has got to be the biggest freedoms that one can have taken away---funny what we take for granted on things that we are used to doing day to day until it is taken away.,F,34,4  years,4/19/2007,Wellbutrin xl

I could focus on all aspect of school work (probably from the high dopamine levels the drugs makes).  Though_ my anxiety wasn't really going away....most likely because this medicine doesn't affect serotonin_ which relates to a person's anxiety (It still helps many people with anxiety).

After doing some on-line reading_ I am doubting that it is not all that infrequent.. I also (some time ago) was prescribed a sleep aid_ that kept me up for days_amitriptyline.

I slept all the time and experienced memory loss that worried me. I had no sex drive. Didn't care about much. This is making me a bit agressive and jittery. I cannot sleep at night_ but it's good to be more active during the day and actually want to leave the house and be social.  It's only been 2 weeks on 150mg a day.

919, 2, Mild Depression,The negatives: Increase in blood pressure_ Crying for no reason_ Erectile dysfunction_ Diarrhea_ Loss of appetite_ loss of sex drive.The positive: I did feel somewhat more normal and was very willing to get out and do things the first 4 weeks in. I also felt as if I had unlimited energy.  Was nice to loose a bit of weight in the begging as well.  But that was mostly waste weight as I am barely eating. However all of that seems to have subsided a bit and have started eating again.  I'm very torn between stopping this stuff and just dealing with the depression or not.  I'd rather be able to have a sex life with my wife than be happy all the damn time.Dosage: 150mg 2X daily.,I was hoping with all the positive feedback about improved sexual drive and lowered blood pressure that I would get lucky and have good side effects upon taking this.  I was quite wrong.  So far during the build up phase I've gone through a great deal of the side effects that they mention possible.  The latest one after 35 days is constant diarrhea and almost total loss of sex drive along with the inability to get a good erection.  This stuff made me feel a bit better but with all the side effects it counteracts the positive.,M,29,35  days,4/3/2007,Wellbutrin xl

I know many other people complain about being too jittery on Wellbutrin_ but my depression had sapped my energy completely_ and a big boost was exactly what I needed. However_ the weird side effects are annoying. I have been on 300mg for about two weeks_ and my muscles are very_ very achy. That's something I'm kind of used to_ though_ since I have fibromyalgia_ and I can't be certain it was caused by the drug. Dry mouth is not something I've ever experienced before_ and wow_ is it ever uncomfortable when you're trying to get to sleep. A glass of juice now occupies a permanent space on my nightstand. By far the most annoying side effect (at least I THINK it's a side effect) has been the hiccuping.

I have to take my second dose by 3:00 pm if I plan to sleep at night. I have found taking it with a beta-blocker like Inderol to be very helpful at eliminating a constant tremor that I developed. So much so that I can actually take mild stimulants_ like caffeine_ as in a single cup of coffee or espresso_ and not be a total space case.

If it does_ I think I'll like this medication. I was not severely depressed_ more SAD but long term stress had produced a flat feeling that sometimes shifted over to depression. I have definitely noticed since starting the medication that I have a super intense focus on whatever I'm doing. This is good_ but I'd prefer if it wasn't so intense. Does the focus balance itself out in time? Does the sense of being diconnected go away? I'd like to feel joy again.

After a week increased to 300mg and things seemed stable for a couple of weeks. Unfortunately_ I began to notice that some days I felt fine and about every 3 days I felt tired and sad.  The doc suggested I increase dose to 450mg daily.  It was a nightmare.  I felt VERY drugged: heart racing_ thoughts racing_ sweaty (probably from talking and moving around so fast)_ trembling hands_ confusion and the feeling that I was somehow detached from the people in the room around me.  It scared me because I recognized that something was really wrong.  I'm back at 300mg and I'm also back to feeling tired and somewhat depressed_ which stinks.I did lose 15 pounds_ though.",F,39,5  months,1/21/2007,Wellbutrin xl
1001, 1, Chronic Depression,"Improved sexual experience_ extra energy_ extreme anger explosions_ crying episodes_ anxiety_ crazy dreams_ unexplained ""itchy"" feeling in head.",This drug does NOT play well with others.  I have been on XL for a few months_ choosing to trade the irritability and anger for the sexual benefits.  But when I had to have emergency gall bladder surgery_ the anethstetic and subsequent vicodin for pain combined with this drug to drive me over the edge.  I have never felt suicidal_ yet I dreamed of my suicide in living color!  Then the panic set in!  It's just not worth it!  I'm stopping now! I have taken Prozac for a couple years_ then Zoloft for a few more.  I didn't like the foggy feeling they gave me_ but I'll go back any day compared to the urgent_ panicky_ angry feeling this drug gives.,F,47,3  months,1/20/2007,Wellbutrin xl
1002, 3, Major Depression,First week on 150mg made me feel like I'd had too many cups of coffee_ very anxious and easily agitated. I recently transitioned from Prozac Weekly to Wellbutrin because of anxiety side effects_ and now it's just as bad. Towards the end of the first week_ I am having uncontrollable crying spells_ like I have a horrible bout of PMS. Today_ I took my first dose of 300mg and cried on my way to work for no real reason. And it was like a sobbing_ giant lump in my throat-type crying. Happened again at work when someone was rude to me. I feel like a total nut job. But it's only been 7 days_ so I guess I should just hang in there. Also taking klonopin at night for anxiety and insomnia. Sex IS better though!,"I have been on Prozac 20 mg for most of my depression career. Prozac makes me feel like a robot_ not too happy_ not too sad_ just like a flat affect_ also ruins my sex life_ so I had problems ""remebering"" to take it everyday. Tried Prozac Weekly_ because of med compliance issues_ and had to stop because of total loss of libido and horrible anxiety. Tried Celexa too_ didn't notice any major changes_ which makes me more likely to skip doses. I just want to find the right drug for me. I know I have depression_ and it's so frustrating to have drs just prescribe one medication after another. I would hope that because one medication doesn't work_ it should tell them something about what's going on in our brains. I guess not.",F,26,7  days,1/19/2007Email,Wellbutrin xl

I also have very vivid dreams.,I'm so glad I found Wellbutrin.  I took Effexor for 2 weeks and that drug was the devil!

No effect on loss of libido.,Been on 150mg_ don't want to up it.  At one month_ I can honestly say I am feeling back to normal.  My energy is back_ I am focused and not so anxious about everything.  Depression is gone.  In the evenings sometimes I find I still need 0.5mg of Ativan if I feel a little anxious. Tried Celexa for 2 years after post pardem and didn't like it_ gained 20 lbs too!

I've been on Prozac_ Anafranil_ and Zoloft in the past and nothing has helped me get out of that deep hole of despair like Wellbutrin XL (150 mg daily). It made me feel happy_ the weight loss gave my self-esteem a boost (my being overweight was one of the factors contributing to the depression_ once the drug started burning the fat off and making me look slim_ I was on cloud nine) It quelled my monthly PMS symptoms_ which always throw me into crying fits and make me go into ""I hate my life_ I wish I could die"" self pity cryfests.   Also_ most importantly_ it prevented me from yelling at my kids and getting upset at all the messes they make around the house. There is something in this drug that silences your ability to yell and freak out at your kids and doesn't let you get ticked off at little things.

Songs I knew for years_ I would blank out on the some of the words. This went away. I was only on 150mg. Never split the pill in half or break it (they aren't kidding on this one). I accidentally bit into one_ and spit it out immediately.  M&Ms in one hand_ pill in the other (got confused trying to rush and take it at my desk). That instant on my tongue went into my bloodstream and caused a dizzy effect that made me have to call my husband to pick me up from work right then and there. It lasted for 4 hours of head tingling and the feeling like I was falling backwards.,I highly recommend this drug.  I had never been on any antidepressant before_ but needed something while going through a divorce.  I'm only 105 lbs_ so the 150mg (half dosage) worked for me.  I only tried the full adult dosage of 300mg once (one day)_ and it was NOT for me. I felt like the left side of my head was tingling and had to leave the grocery store. I did not have a problem ramping down off of this when my doctor and I felt the time was right. It was a breeze for me_ and I feel bad for those who struggle to find the right medicine_ and for those trying to ramp down on really addictive ones like Lexapro and Paxil.

HOWEVER when you combine it with an SSRI like Prozac YOU GET MAGIC. Wellbutrin SR + Prozac you get MAGIC! All the side effects of wellbutrin are cured by Prozac and all side effects of Prozac are cured by Wellbutrin. PURE MAGIC. NEVER TAKE IT ALONE never take prozac or wellbutrin alone. Always combine them(Serotonin - Dopamine and Epinephrine) You need ALL 3 not 1 and not 2. ALL 3 OR NONE.,M,25,30  days,12/8/2006Email,Wellbutrin xl
1039, 1, reduce anxiety & menopause symptoms,Experienced insomnia_ depression and anger. I took Wellbutrin SR (450 mg) for years with very positive results.  My MD switched me to XL because the manuafacuter says that scripts above 300 mg should be XL rather than SR.  This is not true in actual practice. I checked with a respected psychiatrist and was told it was fine to stay on SR even at the higher dosage level.,If you have good results with SR do not assume you will have a smooth transition to XL.  SR can be taken at the higher (450mg) dose once in the morning and pass through your system during the day so you do not experience insomnia.  XL provides less support over more time and_ for me_ resulted in increased anxiety and no sleep.  Lack of sleep worsened my problems.  I believe the push for swithing to XL is about cash in the manufactuers pocket.  SR is available in generic and XL is not. MD's not fully experience in perscribing anti-depressents may be defaulting to the hype rather than perscribing based on experience.,F,47,30  days,12/5/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1040, 5, Depression & PMDD,Constant sleepiness_ inability to stay asleep at night_ very vivid dreams_ increased irritability and anger_ feeling spacey_ so far the only good side effect has been increased libido!,I was switched from Prozac 20-mg daily to Wellbutrin XL 300-mg daily due to the weight gain I experienced from Prozac (50 pounds in 6 months). Prozac worked (for me) to keep the irritability and anger I experience daily at bay. Unfortunately there was the decreased libido and crazy weight gain to deal with. My doc decided to try Wellbutrin. It has been a month and I have yet to see any weight loss as a side effect_ but my temper_ irritability_ and anger have rushed back. I am unable to stay asleep at night_ but when I do sleep_ I have dreams so vivid I thought I was actually awake and actively participating. After reviewing most of these opinions_ I can't really tell if anyone that had the same issues I am having have had them go away. I am really ready to switch back to Prozac and deal with being fat.

FOR ME--too many side effects and not enough benefit. Very successful for my sister.,WHAT A RELIEF TO SEE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH MY SIDEEFFECTS!! Normally I hyper research a drug before I take it_ but this time decided against it to not influence any reactions I may have. BIG MISTAKE!! Had I known the possible_ normal side effects I could have saved my self a lot of time and physical suffering.Wellbutrin (XL - 300 mg) was very successful for my sister so I was switched to it from Effexor (300 mg). I'm calling my shrink today to go off it. The itchiness has now progressed to swelling in the hands and feet_ and to make my depression SO much more fun I'm now breaking our in a hideous rash all over my body. The tinitus is getting unbearable.

1055, 2, depression and anxiety,weight loss. increased emotions/anxiety,after having a devestating experience with prozac (30+ pound weight gain in 11 months) i was to say the least reluctant to try another anti depressant. i was told wellbutrin would be different. it was. i lost 10 pounds in what seemed like the first week of taking it. However_ i was  not told wellbutrin was mainly used to treat depression_ and not anxiety. I became very anxious and moody. i cried all the time at very small things. i had to add other medications (zoloft_ lexapro_ atavan) to balance out the anxiety. in the end i got off all of them. i am still unsure if wellbutrin did anything beneficial other than help me to lose weight,F,16,1  years,11/15/2006,Wellbutrin xl

1066, 4, anxiety and depression,Increased anxiety in the first 2 or 3 weeks- hopelessness /despair & thinking it wasn't working. After 3 weeks it was like a switch went off and I felt 100% better. Another side effect was jaw clenching and some muscle twitches which aggravated my TMJ_ but it DID GO AWAY after a week or so. Increased sex drive- WOW!!! I didn't even realize it til a week or so later but I stopped drinking coffee- this stuff gives me so much ENERGY!! Difficulty sleeping went away within a week.,I'm certainly still capable of anxious thoughts and hopelessness if I let myself go there- but it's EASIER to let it go. I feel very much in control of myself. I took Effexor right before the Wellbutrin and I had NO anxiety but I also felt LIKE A ZOMBIE- I didn't like that.

I haven't really noticed anything else.,The fact that I have not noticed any side effects other than a reduced appetite (which is a positive) makes this possibly the first psychological drug I've ever taken without any particularly negative side-effects. It also definitely helped with my depression and irritability. It's not changed my entire life or anything (and I'm on 450 mg_ which I believe is a pretty high dose)_ but it's definitely helped somewhat.,M,29,15  months,10/21/2006,Wellbutrin xl

I feel great. I have energy_ sex drive_ determination. My life at home and at work has improved tremendously. I am usually depressed this time of year due to colder temps and less light but not while on this med. I feel in control of my emotions and I do not get upset/mad at my kids like I used to.

1086, 5, Severe Depression,None other than I broke out in a rash on my face and neck and had to stop taking it after 3 weeks,I loved Wellbutrin.  I cannot say enough good things about how this brought me out of the darkest depression in little over a week.  I felt good_ I wasn't constantly eating like I was on other antidepressants and it didn't effect my libido.  Unfortunately_ I slowly developed a rash over the 3 weeks I took it and the doctor said it was due to Wellbutrin.  I wish I wasn't allergic because I liked this so much better than Cymbalta which is what I'm on now.,M,29,3  weeks,10/17/2006,Wellbutrin xl

But i've been depressed ever since i can remember. i might also have ptsd. i used to have horrible dreams about my father abusing me as a child.

The first week was awful.  I had serious headaches and anxiety.  I stuck it out because I had hopes the side effects would fade away and most of them did.  I like the sex drive and engergy_ but the extra energy was making me want to drink every night to calm down.  I would also find my self off task all the time. I also often felt that I was just a space cadett.  This drug reminds me too much of speed and that is a bad thing for me.  I stoped taking it after three weeks.,F,23,21  days,9/28/2006,Wellbutrin xl

You'll find it in the vitamin section. My doctor told me about it and you take one before bed to help you sleep. I fall asleep easily and stay asleep. I normally only take one_ but have taken 2 if I feel I'll have more trouble sleeping than usual. Its wonderful stuff and I think its a natural substance. Another great thing about it is you won't feel groggy in the morning and if you have to get up in the middle of the night_ you'll feel fine (not dizzy or disoriented or anything) and when you go back to bed you'll resume your sleeping. As for the Wellbutrin_ I have been more than pleased. Good luck everyone!,F,50,2  weeks,9/26/2006,Wellbutrin xl

Most in my hands and the bottom of my feet...and now my left ear...I love the meds_ but I don't know if I can deal with the itchy body parts.

To put it bluntly_ I AM A MESS!  I feel like crap... I have been having major nausea_ chills (flu-like) and a tingly sensation pretty much all over my body. Oh_ and I am tired and crying for pretty much no reason.  Did I mention the lightheadedness and dizziness?  What is going on?  I don't know if this is from going off the Cymbalta (on 40mg/day) or if it is from going on the Wellbutrin XL.

The next day I was hit with a bladder infection (which is a rare side effect of XL) which I am still trying to get rid of. I still feel tired all the time only more so since I can't sleep as well as I did before_ causing me to be less able to concentrate and feel like I'm very ""zoned out"" which is why I was prescribed this medication to begin with.

I started Wellbutrin XL at 150mg for the first week_ then upped to 300mg per day after that. The first couple weeks I had the bulk of the side effects and my anger/anxiety issues rapidly came back. It was terrible. I was considering going back to Lexapro_ but decided after reading here_ to keep going. Gradually at about 2.5-3 weeks_ I realized all the ugly thoughts were gone. I noticed I wasn't as emotional_ I was calm again. I noticed my food cravings were gone. I could walk through the candy zone in the stores and not give it a thought. I then_ realized my sex drive is back. I am now at 5 weeks and so far_ I sticking with it. I don't have the warm calm feelings I had on Lexapro but I feel good in so many areas I don't want to go back to Lexapro. Also_ I have lost  about 6lbs in 3 weeks.

I do not ever want to return to my previous mental state of depression that I had prior to taking W-XL_ suicide was the predominant thought process I had before this treatment. Becoming much less inhibited though_ like to strip naked in house and in backyard (as long as offspring or neighbors are not around). WXL may or may not be the direct cause of inhibition_ but I am much less inhibited nonetheless if that makes any sense. Kind of always liked the naturist/nudist movement.

I only take 150mgs and I was on 125mgs of Zoloft - I feel that Wellbutrin is very strong.  Good luck!",F,33,10  weeks,8/4/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1126, 5, Depression/Anxiety,major weight loss_ excessive energy_ a general feeling of well being but i feel really lonley at times_ ive been worrying a lot more about pointless things... increased anxiety_ racing heartbeat_ intolerance to alcohol and very increased social anxiety...... buttt very increased sex drive!  ive been taking Wellbutrin for about a year now and even though there are some side effects_ it has helped a great deal with the depression.,I've been taking Wellbutrin for about a year now_ I'm on 300mg. My advice would be to take it in the morning. When I started taking Wellbutrin I tried taking it at night & my energy would just shoot through the roof. Before Wellbutrin_ I was on Zyprexa... *attention* DO NOT TAKE ZYPREXA!!!!!!!! Ever! Let's just say I gained 50lbs & had a lot of neg. side effects. Anyway_ Wellbutrin was great & helped me loose all the weight I had gained & I noticed I was in a much better mood all the time. Plus_ my sex drive increased.. alot. Which isnt a bad thing! But I'm starting to notice some side effects that aren't good. I've been having trouble sleeping_ I've had increased anxiety & can't help but to worry about everything. I've started grinding my teeth at night & i hardly have any tolerance for alcohol ne more. But reccently_ the major problem I'm having is the social anxiety.I never used to be this way. I always used to be the one going out every night... now it's alm,F,18,1  years,8/4/2006Email,Wellbutrin xl
1127, 2, Depression,weight gain (6 lbs in 6 weeks)_ more anxious,Dr. put me on Wellbutrin XL in addition to Paxil to help depression symptoms (Paxil works for me for anxiety_ not much help for depression) and to help overcome sedating effect Paxil has on me. In 6 weeks being on this drug_ I have gained 6 lbs. despite watching my diet and exercising as usual. This is going to sound crazy_ but I swear this drug has caused cellulite_ too. I have significantly more than when I started this drug_ and significantly more than a 6 lb. weight gain should warrant.In addition_ I have also become more anxious and obsessive. I DID feel significantly less tired and more hopeful_ less depressed. But the extra anxiety and the weight gain has made me decide to quit this drug. PS. I've not had weight gain on any other drugs I've taken (Prozac_ Effexor_ Paxil_ Cymbalta).,F,30,6  weeks,8/4/2006,Wellbutrin xl

There was no side effects except that it somehow kicked in the weight gain for the Zoloft. Somehow I think the combination started the weight gain. I gained 30 lbs. in 9 months! The Zoloft killed the sex life_ it was non existent. I was so angry. The Dr. then stopped the Zoloft and introduced 300mg of Wellbrutrin XR. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! In one week I have lost 6lbs_ feel great_ energy like no tomorrow_ the sex life is back!  I can't belive the increased libido and no food cravings at all.

1134, 5, depression,hands down wellbutrin saved my life. i had depression starting in highschool (was misdiagnosed) and was reluctant to seek treatment in college.  just prior to finishing grad school_ i again had difficulties.  i had an awful experience on prozac and ended up in the hospital.  apparently i'm one of the few who become more anxious on prozac.  wellbutrin changed everything in 10 days and has only continued to improve.  i have no intentions of going off it and i never thought i would say that about a drug.  i am ME for the first time in ages.,side effects? dry mouth was unpleasant but goes away.  serious appetite suppressant.  i had trouble starting to enjoy eating again after losing 10 pounds and hitting the double digits - no good.  the shakes decrease also after a few weeks_  but the insomnia never seems to entirely go away.  i can deal with it though.  i didnt notice the improved sexual affects people talk about_ but also wasnt having sex_ so who knows? in general i would say there are a lot of little side effects from wellbutrin.  they can be weird but nothing that would make me stop taking it.  to anyone who has tried SSRIs without success give wellbutrin a shot.,F,26,8  months,7/25/2006,Wellbutrin xl

Plan to go back on Prozac as I felt much more in control despite lack of sex drive. Started x 1 month ago at 150mg and saw no major changes the first two weeks.  Since the dose was increased to the therapeutic level of 300mg daily I feel worse_ but the sex drive has come back.  :)  I can't take the headaches which I have not experienced in the last three years after becoming pregnant.  Have stopped drinking alcohol as it seems to intensify the negative side effects. I'm also tired all the time during the day_ yet can't fall asleep.  Overall_ I feel like crap.  I'm very agitated and become easily frustrated/angered and am likely to snap.

Especially the feeling of racing mind and being on Caffine all day is totally gone. I know it is still effective because I am feeling much better_ I just don't experince the bad side effects. I still get sad and unmotivated sometimes but I bounce back much faster. By the way_ why did you go up to 450mg? Why not stay at 300?

1169, 4, Smoking/Depression/self-dx ADD,Headaches (pressure in temple area)_ very angry the first few weeks_ dry mouth_ a little spacey at times_ slightly increased sex drive_ trouble sleeping_ vivid dreams,I started this Rx (150mg for 2 weeks_ then 150mg 2x day) to help quit smoking and battle ongoing depression. It has definitely helped with both; urge to smoke has greatly decreased (am now working on breaking habits like first AM smoke). Very vivid dreams_ often waking 2-3x time a night_ even with Valerian or Amitriptyline. The combo I finally found that works for perfect sleep is 1 Valerian and 1 melatonin before bed. The depression has lifted_ the crying has stopped and I enjoy life more. I think this med might've worked better had I stopped drinking completely_ something I'm working on (2-3 drinks per night_ no seizures_ tho - something that really scared me when I started the rx). Not much by way of appetite suppression and my sex drive only increased slightly but these were not issues for me. The headaches are the worst side effect for me. (Note: don't take acetaminophen (tylenol) for headaches - WB is already hard on the liver and aceta is 10x worse.) I took Zoloft years ago; it,F,31,120  days,5/27/2006,Wellbutrin xl

I'm on 50mgs of Zoloft and 150mgs of WXL - I will wean off the Zoloft slowly and just be on WXL.  I have lost 2 pounds in 3 days but I gained 55lbs on Zoloft. I was afraid of insomnia but I exercise very hard for one hour daily so insomnia is not an issue. Also_ it would be interesting to know how many people taper off of an SSRI and go onto Wellbutrin.

I discontinued the Effexor and tried Cymbalta as well_ but couldn't deal with the sexual side-effects. Eventually stopped taking and fended for myself. Depression worsened this year and I started on the Wellbutrin 300mg and it once again pooped out after a couple of months_ this time I had my doc up the dose to 450mg and my concentration has returned_ but racing heartbeat is worse than before_ but other side effects seem less apparent this time around. I am more irritable_ but I am able to suppress it so others don't notice. My focus is back and I'm back in the game. I definitely recommend this.,M,36,5  months,5/24/2006,Wellbutrin xl

I was afraid that it would be too much for my system.  Split the pill and took a quarter the first couple of days and then gradually moved up to a half and a whole.  Helped with my PMS/PMDD tremendously this month.  I normally get so bitchy and angry and depressed.  Didn't get that way once and didn't cry once.  My libido has increased.  The Zoloft killed my libido after taking it to treat my PMS/PMDD.  I feel young and vibrant again.  I gained a good bit of weight on zoloft so this has been a god send.

I started taking it after my grandmother died_which sent me on a downward spiral of the depression I have always had lurking above me.I should of gone on an anti-depressant along time ago. There has always been such a negative stigma towards anti-depressants_there for I never wanted to experiment with them. People who are severly against antideppressants probly don`t know what its like to feel this depression....it`s not like I was a constant bummer_I have always just have never felt a strong passion for life.Now I don`t feel dread when its time to get out of bed for work_or even on my days off I actually want to get up and seize the day.

Weight loss of 6 lbs in 3 days.,I can honestly say the first four days on WB XL were amazing.  All obsessive thoughts were gone (and still are)!  Bingeing has stopped completely.  I still have an appetite but am able to stop eating when I am full instead of eating more or obsessing about it.  For that part_ I am so grateful b/c it makes the side effects doable for me.  Experienced anxiety today for a few hours (day 5) but going to the gym seemed to help.  Tons of energy to do cardio and lifting. Now I'm back to the peaceful calm stage.  Haven't had any weepiness or anger as of yet_ hoping that doesn't kick in.  My dr. said to give it two weeks and he said the side effects will subside.  He put me on EFFXR before WB and it was awful.  Tired all the time_ anaorgasma--both reasons I quit. . . just like prozac previously.  Within hours of taking 150 of WB XL I noticed changes.

1196, 4, Smoking cessation,It's odd because all of the potential side effects are pretty much the same as quitting smoking.  The only major_ unaccountable_ side effect that I had was a feeling of extreme heaviness in my legs in the time where I was still smoking and on the drug as well.  But this led me to quit quicker and it went away once I did.  When I first started taking the drug_ my stomach was upset almost every evening - this went away after about a week but I still get upset stomach on occasion.  Also_ I am pretty restless at night and have trouble falling asleep.  This may have partially to do with the fact that I used to have a cigarette right before bed and my body still expects that signal to fall asleep.  I am only staying up about 45 minutes later than I was before I went on the drug_ however.  There was also a small bit of fogginess and speaking fast/euphoria when I first started but this went away very quickly.,"I really don't like taking drugs.  I'm actually diagnosed anxiety disorder and was prescribed Xanax in the past (and as a child was on Ritilin).  I had such a bad reaction to Xanax that I've chosen to be without any drugs to treat my condition for 12 years now.  The Wellbutrin effects were so minor in comparison and has shut down the little ""you need to smoke"" voice in my head so much that it's been entirely worth it (I was able to quit after only eight days of taking the drug and the voice was shut down almost instantly).  I've now had four weeks with very few urges to smoke.  If I were prescribed it to combat my anxiety disorder I would stay on it indefinitely.

Not sure about diagnosis_ anyone else have any of these experience.  Not sure the drug did that much for me anyway.,F,60,9  months,3/30/2006Email,Wellbutrin xl
1215, 5, depression,over-drive,"noticed the difference after 3 days. had taken SR (400mg) for 5 years_ then weaned myself off of it_ experienced recurrance of depression_ decided to try again. feel like my normal self again_ more emotional but i think its just because i was afraid to deal with my feelings before_ i was afraid of my own suicidal thoughts that inevitably followed serious ponderings. now i cry and express myself and feel alive_ real_ normal. as others have said ""fog is lifted""_ but do i have to take this the rest of my life? a bit worried about that. my only other qualm is that sometimes (even on 150mg) i seem hyper compared to others_ do too much_ dont take normal rests or down-periods.",F,20,5  days,3/28/2006,Wellbutrin xl

1217, 3, GAD/SSRI side effects,First 2 weeks: extreme dizziness and flashes of dizziness (could be from Celexa withdrawal)_ anxiety_ sadness_ decreased desire to smoke cigarettes_ increased libido_ ability to orgasm again. After that anxiety_ constipation (taking stool softener helps)_ agression_ anger_ hostility_ irritability_ and mild and sporadic insomnia.,Took XL 300 to counteract sexual sides effects from Celexa 20mg. No major side effects except anxiety_ which sucked because that was why I was taking meds. Also I went from being very easy going on Celexa to being very hostile on Wellbutrin. (I am switching to Buspar 15mg tomorow. Hopefully that will work.) Overall not a bad medication_ just not right for what I need. PS every medication is different for everybody. If you are reading these posts_ don't let the negative comments scare you. Give the medicine a chance before you decide if it works for you or not. Just because WXL did not work for me_ does not mean it won't work for you. Your body will let you know.,F,26,2  months,3/27/2006,Wellbutrin xl

Fourth day: previous side effects as well as severe nausea_ vomiting_ diarrhea_ headache_ stomach cramps.,"I was actually feeling pretty good the first 3 days.  Even started to feel my spirits lift.  But when the 4th day hit_ it knocked me out for the day. My mother-in-law had to take my two toddlers for me.  I considered that it may be a virus_ but have a hunch that it is the medication. I will go off of it for a couple of days and see how I feel_ then reconsider what to do. Tried zoloft for 3 months previous to this.

Lexapro made me gain 15 lbs_ so whatever_ on the right track.  Wellbutrin on the whole will keep you pretty wired_ so my dr wants me to take separate meds for anxiety as XL does nothing for it.

I put on 20lbs with paxil and I desperately want to take it off.  Does it happen pretty quickly?  Does it seem to just curb hunger or does it actually do something to make weight come off?

Was hoping I might shed a few pounds.,Took 150mg for 2 weeks. Then increased to 300mg.  Have been on that dose for 8 days now.  I was told to expect some insomnia and was given Ambien in case. Only had trouble on the 150mg the first couple days_ but that has gone away. I do wake up about 2-3am_ but go back to sleep. I am fine all day_ then about 5pm I start getting angry about everything and crying.  Don't know why. But I am able to study and focus better_ and I get things accomplished without a battle_ so that's good. Need to figure out the anger thing. Other than that it's helping me!

I've never been diagnosed with OCD but I swear this drug brought it out in me_ I had almost to much energy. Vivid dreams. But just after a week or so I'm in a terrible mood_ I'm irritable_ have frequent crying spells_ tired_ withdrawn_ I can't get my thoughts together to even communicate to my husband as to why I'm so upset. I've heard this is normal_ I've heard it is not. I need some advice. Also_ my doctor told me I could take WB XL 150 in the morning or at night_ because of my past experiences with meds (bad ones) I always took them at night_ so I take my WB XL at night. Is there any advantage to me taking this med in the morning as opposed to night? Also_ my doc. gave me 1mg of kolonopin if I need to take it_ I usually take one at night to help me sleep w/ the wellbutrin xl 150. Is this combination bad? Anyone ever had any issues with this combo?,I would really appreciate some feedback from someone who experienced the same problems I'm having.

I was on this dose the longest.  During this time I started experiencing all of the side effects I listed except for the seizures.  People were telling me I was terrifyingly angry and violent all the time.  The smallest things would set me off into an uncontrollable rage.  As for suicidality_ Wellbutrin actually helped some of the time while at others I hit extreme self-hating lows (extra energy = extra anger).  I mentioned all of this to my psychiatrist_ who suggested upping the dose even more to see if it was really the Wellbutrin that was causing my anger.  I went up to the 450 mg dose_ and 3 days later i was convulsing in the middle of math class from a huge seizure.  I woke up very confused to a bunch of paramedics who took me to the hospital.

I have absolutely no appetite at all and all food sounds and looks disgusting to me.  I gained 30 pounds (now 160) on other SSRIs over the past couple years_ so the prospect of losing that is GREAT.

There is nothing like feeling like you have food or pills sitting in your throat.  I can't sleep_ I am uncomfortable_ scared to eat_ and it's getting worse by the day.  I have made an appointment and will see my Dr. today.  I took my pill this morning and it literally won't go down!  Even if I eat food_ things I have swallowed linger there in my throat.  I have trouble going to bed at night_ but am still tired in the a.m.  I don't have bounding energy and my sex drive did not improve.  It didn't get much worse_ because it already sucked... I have 3 small kids and I think it is just the way it's gonna be until they are more self sufficient.

My life is much more managable now and thedepressive bouts are short_ few and far between.,F,39,60  days,1/29/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1264, 1, Mild depression,At 150mg_ mild dry mouth in evening_ a few palpitations in the evening_ small difficulty in falling asleep_ decreased libido and appetite_ constipation. At 300mg_ first day moderate spaciness (not unlike being drunk)_ sensitivity to light_ scattered_ mild restlessness_ toothache on both sides. All of the above was only a slight inconvenience_ but on day 11 arrived the coup de grace_ a huge PANIC ATTACK for the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE_ while driving a car. My left chest felt strongly constricted_ and explosions of warm tingles (think when you are startled_ but 10 times more powerful) spreading out again and again through my body. I parked the car_ called 911_ and laid moaning on the ground thinking I was about to die of a heart attack (they set me straight at the ER). I was in the 3% for panic attacks. I have to wonder now that the road has been paved and I had the first panic attack from Wellbutrin_ am I to expect them again without it?,150mg for 5 days_ and then 300mg a day. First 2 days on 150mg my emotions appeared to be muted_ both positive and negative_ after that I returned to my baseline_ and couldn't tell any difference.,M,27,11  days,1/25/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1265, 4, clin depres /social anx / wt gain,slight irritability_ but could have been caused by life events_ such as moving. Possibly causes burning in stomach which goes away upon drinking 12 oz water. slight drying of eyes (could be due to new environment though) Taking 150 mg. Libido increased.,Suffered slight depression for yrs. Tried Zoloft_ worked for a couple of yrs_ but then stopped working and had gained a lot of weight. Since being on WB XL 150. lost 20lbs. Focusing better_ social anxiety getting better and depression lifts until around 4pm (added stress time) then feel sadness creeping in. Thinking of increasing dosage to 300mg to see if it helps for night time. Will post more after. -Autumn 1-20-06,F,38,8  months,1/20/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1266, 3, Fatigue,I'm Dizzy- for a lack of a better word.  I have a feeling of butterfies in my stomach like the feeling you get inside after doing a somersault... It does get worse when I move.  But I'm not to the point of falling over... (yet),I noticed this side effect right away_ I kept telling my husband I felt 'weird'... I am on 150mg right now_ but start the 300mg tomorrow... I'm holding off on telling my Dr. about the dizzyness_ in hopes that it will get better as my body gets used to it.,F,24,1  weeks,1/19/2006,Wellbutrin xl

I went back to sleep in the am after getting children off to school.  I was so moody_ I couldn't stand to be around me.  I had massive loss of concentration_ even while driving.,F,32,6  months,1/18/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1268, 3, Severe Depression,First day_ I felt very loopy.  That went away after a couple days on the med.  There are times (which seem to be more and more frequent) where I'm really agitated if I am down too long not doing anything of substance.  Gas is definitely something that comes on for most of the day_ not long after taking the dose.  Libido seems to be swinging to both ends of the spectrum_ compared to my insatiable libido any other time.  Constipation seems to be a problem as well.  I never had a problem with that part of me until after starting on Wellbutrin_ so it's something else to look at.,There are good things to mix with the bad though.  A clarity of thought I thought was long gone_ returned within the first week.  I am able to take on more complex things with much greater ease than before_ and in a frame of mind that didn't leave me feeling overwhelmed.I'll give it through this bottle before deciding if I want to try something else to negate those 2 side effects that seem to be the most annoying.,M,29,6  weeks,1/17/2006Email,Wellbutrin xl
1269, 2, depression,nausea_ a lot of unending menstrual-like stomach cramps_ continuous food craving_ crying at minor things on t.v.,I went on wellbutrin (300mg/day) at the same time I went off effexor.  Since I completely stop the effexor a week ago_ I have been having stomach cramps and nausea on and off.  I am going to stick with the medicine a little longer and see if it goes away_ but I can't take much more of this.,F,21,7  days,1/10/2006,Wellbutrin xl

That's all I could stand. I was unable to function at work and could not stay focused on any one job. I shouldn't have even drove home that night. Beware of this medication. I've never had any drug do to me what this beast did.,F,38,1  days,1/9/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1272, 5, BiPolar-Manic- MS,I went from NO energy what so ever to being in a race car.  I can not sleep and when I do finally fall asleep I wake 2-3 times per night in sweat from my head to my toes and my bed drenched.  My mouth is terribly dry.  I am just glad to have my energy back but it sucks not being able to sleep.,I have been VERY ill for the last 6 months and due to being sick it has started to affect me negativly in a emotional way.  I am on the generic form of 150mg per day. If anyone knows of anything else for me to try please send me a email_ I am willing to try ANYTHING. I am only on my 3rd day but we will see what goes from here.  Keep your fingers crossed :),F,22,3  days,1/7/2006Email,Wellbutrin xl
1273, 4, Depression,at 150 mg none / at 300 mg insomnia_ anxiety_ some paranoia (I was terrified after watching scary movies)_ everything tasted like metal.,Obviously this drug does not work for everyone and if it does work for some_ it has different effects on people_ be cautious if your doctor wants to increase the dosage from 150 to 300_ instead insist on a gradual increase ONLY if needed.  I felt great at 150 mg_ like I haven't felt in years.  Afterm taking the 300 mg for a week_ I hated this drug_ I insisted I be put back to 150 and have been feeling great since.  Also quit smoking in 1 week after smoking for 20 years.,M,40,4  weeks,1/6/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1274, 4, Depression,Sleep pattern completely disrupted_ nausea_ horrible hangovers when drinking_ almost becoming a recluse_ do not want to be around many people.,In the first month I had much more energy but now (month 2) I feel completely tired again. I can stay up all night and then want to sleep all day. (would be great if I worked at night_ but I don't!)  Was thinking of taking the dose at night to try to regain control over my sleep pattern again. I also have become almost dependent on my husband when in social situations_ (I was always the life of the party before)it is as if I do not want to be out in public WITHOUT him. I do enjoy not feeling as hungry as I used to_ but I have found that I am not hungry for about a week and then become famined. When I do eat I feel nauseous. My depression has begun to subside_ just need help in the sleep area.,F,30,2  months,1/6/2006Email,Wellbutrin xl
1275, 2, Depression_ fatigue,My hope was to obtain a stimulating effect from the drug_ enabling me to get off of Ritalin or Adderall for fatigue.  So far_ it's had a paradoxical effect_ making me more lethargic than energetic (Provigil had the same effect).,At least I was able to tolerate this one better than Prozac_ Zoloft_ or most other anti-depressants.  I've even worked up to 300 mg. per day with the XL formula (for some reason_ I couldn't handle two 100 mg. of the SR formula).  But where are the benefits?,M,65,3  months,1/4/2006,Wellbutrin xl
1276, 5, depression/ADD,Some very mild nausea_ possible increased arousal with slight increase in blood pressure,I was doing a medical residency with tough work requirements when I again began to take WXL. I have some attention problems but with an IQ of 139 I have been able to skate throught life anyway_ untill real hard. all-week intellectual demands in a dreary rural environment.I could not keep track of the endless_ pointless paperwork I had to do after seeing patients and wellbutrin made a very clear_ probably critical difference in both (1)  Feeling I could enjoy myself part of the4 day ( 300 mg did not completely remit my depression) AND  (2) Being organized enought to do the paperwork. Also_ was able to have sex fine. although part of my depression was living alone in the sticks (styx?)  social tension with authority figures still was a problem which paxil worked better for but I hate feeling sexually neutered.,,49,5  years,12/31/2005Email,Wellbutrin xl
1277, 4, depression,First 2-3 days- racing thoughts_ couldn't sleep but woke up with abundance of energy!Leveled off around day 5.3 weeks- woke up to HUGE rash_ itching under skin and joint pain so severe that I could barely walk.,I loved it! It brought me out the constant fogginess I have been in for years! I felt like my old self. It didn't affect my appetite as I still ate when I normally would. I was noticing a renewed interest in sex....that was great!I am upset that I cannot take it anymore after my reaction as the other meds cause weight gain which I do not want. I don't know what I will do now_ my doc has switched me to Effexor XR but I hear it is awful so I am skeptical of it after this reaction to Wellbutrin. Good luck!,F,28,21  days,12/29/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1278, 5, Depression,Fast weight loss (30 lbs) and I was a normal weight_ dry mouth_ heart racing_ insomnia_ agitation,After years of taking SSRI's I had it with the weight gain and lethargic_ apathetic outlook on life.  Wellbutrin XL gave me my life back.  All the weight I gained on Paxil and was unable to lose I lost with this stuff.  I could go days without eating.  This stuff is a miracle.  It was great until it triggered mania for me and I had to be taken off and put on a mood stabilizer.,F,23,6  months,12/26/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1279, 4, Depression/Anxiety,Feeling wired up.  A little sleepless.Dry Mouth,I would say I'm now suffering Superman syndrome.  I feel a little to talkative and am lacking a filter at times w/ my sarcasm.  This stuff worked almost immediately and my anxiety is way down.  I had been waking up most mornings in a bit of a fog w/ the weight of the world landing on me.  I'm definitely more productive at work and find myself procrastinating less.  I'd had a habit of feeling a little sad at times during the day and that is gone.  So is some of the negative threads of thought that were present t/o the day.,M,33,3  days,12/26/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1280, 5, Depression,Dry eyes and mouth. A bit of anxiety and insomnia,It is helping me so much. I have more energy and I WANT to get out of bed in the morning and do things.  Prozac and paxil helped but they made me sleepy. I hope this keeps working for me. No change yet with libido and appetite but I'm hoping that kicks in.,F,47,3  weeks,12/22/2005,Wellbutrin xl

1282, 5, Anxiety & Depression,During the 1st 10 days_ I felt speedy - constant thirst_ hyperactive_ insomia_ very little appetite & occassional tremors (which really freaked me out). After that_ side effects subsided. Now_ only experience decreased appetite_ constipation_ and occassional rage when angry. Positive side effects include smoking & alcohol cessation_ weight loss (11 lbs in 6 weeks)_ increased sexual libido_ increased focus & energy.,Am actually taking Wellbutrin SR_ not XL_ and the generic form. I'm thrilled with its effectiveness. Not only is my depression getting under control_ but I've started to lose the weight I put on while depressed_ have regained my libido_ stopped drinking alcohol & caffiene_ stopped smoking and have more energy. I can't understand why anyone would choose an SSRI like Prozac or Paxil over Wellbutrin. When I took Prozac I felt numb_ had no interest in sex_ and gained weight.,F,28,6  weeks,12/20/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1283, 5, bipolar,!!!!!!!!!!!  I only rated this a 5 so it would be up front....this medication caused me severe discomfort and bothersome side effects_ worse than effexor_lamactil_lithium_buspar_lovvax_depakote_thorazine_effexor_tegratole.....wellbutrins worse!!!!!!!!!!,I took wellbutrin for 5 days_ 150 mg. Had to stop taking it as it caused a sudden onset of urinary incontinence. This problem has continued for some time after dicontinuing_ and has brought much difficulty and aggrivation in an already bothersome condition. Now not only has my depression persisited but now I have the constent urge to urinate and have small amounts of leakage_ a very troublesome condidtion. I would think twice before using this medication. I have battled bipolar and depression for 10 years and i have tried lithium_ effexor_ luvvex_thorazine_buspar_tegratal_zoloft_ lamactil_ depakote_serequil_and have dealt with an array of side effects but never one as bothersome as this. As many know it is a constent trial and error in the regards to finding the right medication_ and through all_ wellbutrin_the so called least of side effects has been in my case the worst in comparison to all stated above.,F,28,5  days,12/19/2005,Wellbutrin xl

1285, 1, Depression,I hate this medicine. My doctor took me off of Lexapro three weeks ago because I had gained 18 pounds since I started. I will just have to be fat...because I am going to end up being skinny in jail.I am very angry all of the time. I am moody and irritable. I have thoughts of suicide and feel as though I could kill someone. I hate these feelings this medicine is giving me. Everyone says it will go away. I am not going to give it time.,At Christmas dinner last night_ I was explaining to my family how I feel all of the time and I was shocked to find out that I was not alone. My sister said that she had taken it and after two weeks they thought they were going to admit her. Her husband had taken it to quit smoking and it worked great...but he became very mean. I am a very kind hearted and gentle person. I am in college to become a school teacher and I teach Sunday School at church and this medicine is making me someone I do not want to be.

I was so numb for so long.  My Dr. told me in the first 2 weeks my anxiety may get worse before it evens out so he gave me a prescription for Xanax if I need it in the meantime.

My doctor told me to stop taking it for a week to see if I notice a difference.  I did_ and my skin did begin to clear a little.  He took me off of it switched me to lexapro but my depression came back.  I asked him if he could put me back on the Wellbutrin because it seems like this is the ONLY antidepressant that has worked for me.  Now_ I'm back on it...and here comes the acne again.  Not sure of how I feel about it.  Acne or Depression??,F,30,3  months,12/15/2005,Wellbutrin xl

It really cut my appetite_ before with just lexapro I kept thinking about food but wellbutrin helped me with that and I have increased confidence about my weight. I did notice increase in anxiety which is bad because i tend to be anxious and angry more than depressed. However_ I have alot of energy and am able to go running for alot longer and I feel better about myself because of my energy.

After some additional stress (birth of a child)_ Dr. increased my dose to 300 mg_ anger went out of control_ it was my only response to any kind of situation.  Reduced dose back to 150 but unable to control temper_ irritable all the time.  Finally quit cold turkey_ headache for two weeks but got thru it.

1292, 4, Depression-Lack Of Motivation....,The only noticable side effects taking Wellbutrin XL was an inability to sleep as long as I did before. It does give me a bit more energy_ so I suppose that's the reason it's harder to sleep. But that's a lot better than wanting to sleep too long!,Wellbutrin XL....lets me concentrate better. It enables me to see things clearer. It gives me a calm sense of well being. I am so much more in tune with my emotions. I really think it's a wonderful medication_ if it works for you. I'm also on Effexor 37.5. Maybe it's the combination of these two medications that makes it work so well. I was taking Cymbalta. Oh my_ that was the worst medication I've ever dealt with. The side effects made me think way to much about suicide. Not a good drug for me. But with Wellbutrin XL and Effexor 37.5_ I'm feeling pretty good :) And yes_ some of the side effects that many have posted_ DO GO AWAY....,F,55,8  months,12/10/2005Email,Wellbutrin xl

I had a serious allergic reaction_ breaking out in large hives. They started around my hips_ and then appeared on my knees_ elbows and feet. Both wrists swelled up tight. This all happened within a few hours. The doctor did not think it was the drug_ and put me on Benadryl for 5 days. After that_ I started having jaw spasms that affected my speech. The frequency of the spasms increased throughout the following week. The dizziness also increased. My temples often felt tight. When the jaw/tongue spasms started to occur every 20 minutes or so_ I decided it was time to quit. All symptoms disappeared with 48 hours of stopping the drug.,F,26,3  weeks,12/10/2005,Wellbutrin xl

The last time I became rapidly suicidal without any particular cause I was on Effexor and I attempted twice while on it. My manic tendencies were blamed on my self-starvation and addiction to caffeine pills in the past_ but continued after I was treated for both. My panic attacks had been under control for many years until Wellbutrin_ I have hallucinated in the past but it has been a very long time and I attribute this directly to the Wellbutrin. Despite the horrible memories of Effexor withdrawal I have discontinued Wellbutrin cold turkey.

The worst side effect is that is makes me extremely light headed. I feel like I'm going to faint.,I've only been on Wellbutrin XL for three weeks now and I'm on the lowest dosage of 150 mg._ I'm not sure what to do. I like that I'm not having mood swings and far less side effects than that of Effixor. My husband likes the fact that I have an increased sex drive. I'm excited about the possiblility of losing the 30 pounds that I gained with Effixor. So I'm going to try to cut my little tiny 150 mg tablets into quarters and take once a day bringing my daily dosage down to 37.5 mg. (By the way_ my vet taught me a trick on how to cut pills. Take the orange high end dog nail clippers (767 Stainless Millers Forge Italy) and they cut the pills beautifully and accurately.

But yesterday on the way home from work (5:30p) I turned into a different person.  I was moody_ angry (at what I have no idea).  I got home and everything my husband said made me mad.  I feel so bad for him and that adds to my depression. This is day 5 and I don't feel WXL has made a dent in my depresion. I feel it has made it worse.  I'm on 150mg right now.

The pain in the back has gone away_ insomnia cured with homeopathic sleep aid_ low grade headaches on occasion_ no complaints sexually.,Feeling like my old self and not so depressed.  Hoping the shortness of breath_ neck pain_ and irritability will go away all together.  Going to give it a full six weeks and see then.

I can't say enough good things about Wellbutrin (but ONLY XL...the multi-dose version made me feel like I was on crack).  I feel like my life is finally opening up and I can do things.  Have begun to make good decisions again.  Was kidnapped and sexually assaulted three years ago and have been practically dead ever since.  Now I feel I can begin again.  I feel brand new_ and I began to notice remarkable effects after only 3 or 4 days on Wellbutrin.  I take 150 mg 1 or 2 times/day.,F,26,5  months,11/4/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1307, 5, Major Depression,Migraines_ Loss of Appetite,I absolutely LOVE this medication.  I have been taking it for 19 days at 150 mg a day.  Before I took it I cried every day for hours.  I hated life and I constantly thought about suicide.  After being on it for 5 days I felt a lot better but I noticed that an hour after taking it I would get a really bad migraine_ so I would have to take 50 mg of Imatrex as well.  The only problem with this is by law I only get 9 pills a month.  Thanfully_ the migraines have started to go away and have become less intense.  Also since being on the medication I have eaten a lot less and haven't been too hungry.  Before the medication I was eating CONSTANTLY.  I haven't lost any weight yet but we shall see.  Anyway_ I would definitely advise anyone to take this medication.  It has helped me a great deal.,F,19,19  days,10/28/2005,Wellbutrin xl

Waiting for weight loss and increase in libido side effects!,Taking 150 mg. in the a.m. for PMDD--very severe form of PMS_ but with extreme lows & somtimes suicidal ideations--symptoms disappear after menstruation begins.

Feel a warm_ fuzzy sense of well being and calmness most of the time. In control. Sleep very well. WB like caffeine in the a.m.  Did experience some emotional episodes a few days ago_ but think was normal due to circumstances. Will gladly trade current side effects for overwhelming positives.

I generally had no emotional responses to things under treatment with Paxil_ so I stopped taking them. I was fine for a few years_ the depression started again with anxiety attacks I could not forsee coming.  Wellbutrin xl has been thusfar trouble_ but reading about how the side effects MAY go away_ I am willing to give it a try.  What else can I do?  I take a very low dose of xanax with this drug in the morning and it seems to mellow me out a bit.  I have had sex more in the last week though than in the previous month.

Libido unaffected however unable to acheive orgasm which is a strain on my relationship. I am in the process of weaning off for this reason. Too bad it helped with the depression but it killed my ability to achieve the big O. Guess I am one of the small percentage that will still have sexual side effects. Prozac was 10 times worse. I didn't want sex and I gained weight. So I am going to be brave and try alternative methods. I just learned of the sexual side affects because I am in a relatively new relationship.,I am not sure the claim to low sexual side effects is that accurate.

I have severe pain and muscle tension across my upper back_ tops of my shoulder and into my neck all the way up to my skull. I am not clenchng my teeth but they are sensitive and sore. The dry mouth is not too bad so far; this is a very big concern for me as I can't take most meds because of severe dry mouth. I cannot sleep. I have had about 9 hours sleep in 3 days. I am crying a bit. My anxiety feels increased. I don't really feel depressed_ just uncomfortable about these side effects and wondering if I can/should stick with it. Tonight I took Ambien 10 mg around 9 pm and was very hopeful to sleep until morning but I woke at 2 am and am now writing this at 4 am. My appetite is reduced_ no sugar cravings but I really haven't lost any weight yet (maybe 1 pound). I have more energy but am exhausted from no sleep. The sexual side effects with this drug are definitely good ones.,I rated this a 2 although I am not really sure yet how to rate it. I am pleased about the lack of bad sexual side effects and the lack of food cravings. It sure hasn't made a dent yet in my anxiety_ which I consider to be way more of a problem for me than the depression.

The reason is because you are literally dead on Paxil_ and it has by far the strongest numbing effect of any other medication I have ever tried_ not even painkillers make you feel as numb as Paxil.  Honestly_ taking a shower on Paxil was like the challenge of a lifetime_ it's pathetic.  I stopped Effexor XR cold turkey_ and I kicked the withdrawal symptoms' ass - apparently this drug has the worst withdrawal symptoms_ however I was prepared_ because no drug is ever going to control my life.  In fact_ on Effexor XR I wasn't alive either_ I simply existed_ and slept all day.  Then came Wellbutrin XL as my last resort and hope_ and it worked extremely well_ matter of fact_ as of the very first day.  It just kept going uphill from there every day as I continued to take it.

Increased sexual libido!,After taking effexor xr for 4 years_ I asked my doctor to change my AD because of sexual dysfunction.  On the effexor_ I had some sex drive_ but almost unable to achieve orgasm.  Sometimes I would plan sex a couple days ahead_ then not take my effexor for 2 days - just so I could have some kind of sexual satisfaction.

I've been getting sharp and dull pains and bloating and constipation which varies from annoying to crying on the bathroom floor.  My lesser complaints include some headaches_ and lower sex drive (on the SR_ my libido was through the roof) but I'm attributing that to the unsexy feelings related to gastrointestinal discomfort.

1340, 3, Depression/Anxiety,Nothing at first_ except for increased libido and relief from anorgasm. Been on 300mg for about 2 months now_ though_ and dealing w/ a lot of indigestion/gas/cramping/headaches recently. Also lack of appetite.,I originally started on Lexapro_ which honestly did a fabulous job to improve my mood_ motivation_ focus_ everything...the only problem was that it increased my libido and pretty much negated any ability to orgasm (and I've NEVER had a problem with this before).  It was extremely frustrating to finally be in the mood again and not be able to fully enjoy it.  Doc wanted to switch me to Effexor but I read some bad things about it w/ regard to sexual side effects and bad withdrawal symptoms_ so I asked if I could try WXL first.  Started off on 150mg but I found by the afternoon the effect had worn off and I got very irritable.  After 4 weeks_ I increased to 300mg WXL...keeps my mood balanced throughout the day_ with occasional feelings of irritability_ but now I've got really bad indigestion (daily) and I seem to have become lactose intolerant.  Really don't know if it's WXL_ but I can't think of anything else that has changed.  Haven't lost any weight yet_ but my appetite has definately decreased...find it hard to get myself to eat anything...tend to eat bland food when I do (cereal_ crackers_ etc.)  Just wondering if anyone else has similar symptoms and if it gets better or worse.  I will say that in terms of my mood and motivation_ Lexapro did a MUCH better job for me_ but it wasn't worth the effect it had on my libido (for me or my husband).

I have actually had weight GAIN...and I was so looking forward to the side effect of losing!,History: My doc gave me wellbutrin instead of Zyban because he said they were the exact same drug just marketed differently so the drug co. could keep track of it's usage (depression or quitting smoking) and he said that insurance usually pays more when given under the wellbutrine name. ----It did it's job I quit smoking on day 4.

1354, 3, Major Depression,The only side effect I really noticed was that at times I had brief periods that I would be able to vividly remember things all the way back one time when I was only about 6 months old. It wasnt like I had ESP or anything but I sometimes would have very strong feelings that something would happen good or bad and I was about 80% correct.Its something that I have no control over and it doesnt happen very often. Its a side effect that is interesting to me. I wish I had some control over it_ but sometimes its as simple as telling whoever I might be traveling with what songs would be playing on different stations 3 times in a row. I just had a strong feeling and I told my friend. It might have just been circumstance_ and it has never happened when not taking Wellbutrin,It works well at times for my Major Depression. I also take it with Provigil and the combination seems to really help with the fatigue that comes with FMS/CFS.I dont respond very well to the current anti-depressants. At one time I did_ but now it seems that I have to switch quite often to get much effect from any of the anti-depressants. I have taken Wellbutrin on and off for several years_ so I am just covering the entire time in the length of time listed below,M,39,8  years,7/18/2005Email,Wellbutrin xl
1355, 5, depression / bi-polar,The first month or so of taking wellbutrin SR (300mg) made me experience dry mouth_ insomnia_ loss of appitite and a strange feeling every time I swallowed. It was like the timing of my swallowing was off and each time I swallowed_ I swallowed air. Obviously some bloating accompanied it.,After the initial side effects went away_ I experienced great relief from my depression. However I was more irratable than ever. It was paired with Depakote (made my hair fall out) and then Tegretol. That second combination has made my life so much better for the last 8 years. I still have dry mouth and my eyes feel dry often_ and sitting in a windy area for an extended time will give me a headache.

I have extreme pains in my stomach/abdominal area_ but take some gasX and it goes away. For awhile I didnt know what to take but my mom recommended it so I tried it and its great.

It was hard to stop using it_ it caused very bad headaches and bad moods until it got out of my system.,It had too many bad side effects for me to tell if it helped my depression or not.,M,39,6  months,6/7/2005,Wellbutrin xl

Do you know long this will usually last?,I've taken Wellbutrin SR in the past_ for approx. 10 months 2 years ago and do not remember having the abovementioned side effects.

I went off for a year and now am taking XL. I started at 150 and am now at 300. My sense of humor has returned and I have increased patience and ability to practice the skills I'm learning in therapy. I am pleased with the meds. Unfortunately_ my teeth seem to be really sensitive when I'm taking XL.  I wonder if anyone else has experienced this???,F,47,3  months,5/18/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1364, 5, To remove craving for cocain.,Since I was prescribed WB to cope with my coke addiction_ my life changed. The evil craving for stimulant drugs I had for many years was like magically lifted (could not belive it) and I could focus on my recovery and get some distance to my using. I can tell Wellbutrin definitely works on blocking the dopamine cells as other uppers do. My libido is the same as beeing,I think this drug should be used more than it is now for recovering stimulant addicts as it is for people trying to quit smoking. With Wellbutrin you can quit anything (except sex ha_ha),M,35,2  years,5/11/2005Email,Wellbutrin xl

I read everyone elses comments and they say that their first days where the best_ well mine are not. I am happier though_ not soo many thoughts running through my head. But then I feel like I am so tired_ and jittery and spacing out. I hope that these are just the beginning and that I am the opposite of all these other people and that the side effects will diminish. I really feel better_ but you know all meds do is take away one problem and leave you with another. It all comes down to what you can handle and what you want to be and not want to be!!I hope that it helps other people. I hope that it gets better for me!!!But so far it is good all over_ give or take!!!,F,23,3  days,5/4/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1367, 4, depression/anxiety/OCD,feelings of anger-rage,SO much better than Wellbutrin SR. I don't feel it stop working between doses like I did on SR. Increased sex drive that Zoloft had killed. Took throughout pregnancy (with much anxiety-lesser of 2 evils)- baby seems wonderfully health & happy at 8 months.,F,32, ,5/3/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1368, 4, Postpartum Depression,Increased sex drive_ jolt of energy after I take it in the morning_ increased irritability_ increased appetite (opposite of most reviews I've read),I started taking 150mg in the morning for postpartum depression.  I immediately had an increased libido (and a happier husband).  I've had an increase in irritability_ although I've heard that side effect will disappear after taking Wellbutrin for 4-6 weeks.  I definitely feel better now than when on 200mg of Zoloft.  I felt like a complete zombie on Zoloft.  If my anger/irritability doesn't subside in a few weeks_ I'll consider changing the dosage.  All in all_ I would recommend Wellbutrin XL_ but keep in mind to give it a few weeks to take full effect.,F,25,3  weeks,4/26/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1369, 4, Major depression,Switched to XL a month ago after 3 months on Wellbutrin SR.  Side effects worsened after switching to XL. They include: extremely dry mouth and nostrils; swollen tongue; difficulty breathing_ swallowing and talking because of the above; painfully tense neck and upper back; constantly clenched jaw; difficulty concentrating on and completing tasks; trouble with short-term memory; constipation; tired muscles; insomnia; brittle nails on fingers and toes; libido in extreme overdrive_ but almost complete inability to orgasm (now THAT'S a bad combination!!); racing heartbeat; loud ringing in ears at all times. I'm sure I've forgotten some_ but maybe I've just gotten used to them...,I've been on the maximum dosage (450mg/day) for almost a month_ and I've had almost every side effect in the book_ and then some. I'm simultaneously taking maximum daily dosage of Effexor. I preferred Wellbutrin SR to the XL. My life DID get better after starting the combination of Wellbutrin and Effexor three months ago.  My mood elevated_ my personality and sense of humor returned_ my energy increased_ and  stopped needing to cry all the time.  Other than the side effects_ I started feeling like my old self again!  I've read comments from others who are discouraged_ but most of them have only taken it for a few days. Please don't give up!  And maybe ask your doctor about SR_ or combining Wellbutrin with another drug.  Lexapro was a nightmare for me_ as was Remeron_ and Effexor by itself.  Adding Wellbutrin to my regime made an enormous difference!,F,52,1  months,4/26/2005,Wellbutrin xl
1370, 1, Libido was down due to Celexa,After two weeks_ I fell into a great depression sobbing everyday multiple times able to do so immediately.  I was so tired_ lazy_ and unmotivated to keep in touch with family and friends.  I had to apologize to everybody after a couple more weeks when I finally felt better.  Initially_ headaches were so intense and my jaw and temples throbbed for days.  I thought these symptoms would subside eventually and they did_ but not the sudden fall into a deep depression consuming my life.,I hear it's more effective when taken with other anti-depressants.  My libido did improve_ but the worsening depression reversed that drastically  leaving me worse off.  I was on 150mg.,F,22,3  weeks,4/25/2005Email,Wellbutrin xl
1371, 4, Depression,I take 300 mgs of Wellbutrin XL with Klonopin (for anxiety). No obvious side effects but I've been having sudden urges to rush to the restroom to urinate.  However_ I am on 4 other meds for my cholesterol and for blood pressure so I can't say for sure if it's the Wellbutrin causing the problem yet.,The switch from prozac was due to the loss of libido.  Not much has changed in that area I'm sorry to say. Other than that the switch seemed uneventful to this point.,M,43,2  months,4/23/2005Email,Wellbutrin xl
1372, 4, Depression and Anxiety,I have trouble sleeping through the night_ usually awakening 2-3 times.  The first two days I was on it and I was kind of shaky and had to keep moving.  I was also very anxious.  I think it has increased my libido.  While I still experience some,I really think it's working to help my depression and anxiety.  I've only been on it for 9 days at 150 mg_ so I'm excited to see how much better I can get when I increase to 300 mg in a week.,F,23,9  days,4/22/2005,Wellbutrin xl

Spaced out feeling_ jitteriness_ indigestion (felt like I had to burp all day long)_ decreased appetite.,Today was my second dose at 150mg.  Already I feel more energetic but with a little anxiety.  Kinda feels like taking a shot of double espresso only it lasts all day.  I'm hoping that the drug levels out soon cause I don't exactly like all these side effects.  Would love to sleep soundly again...,F,31,2  days,4/22/2005,Wellbutrin xl

This drug is great and I recommend it to anyone suffering from any type of depression. I feel like my old self again.,I am glad I have found this;however_ I hope I do not have to take it for a long time. I want to be my old self without the help of drugs.

1376, 3, Bipolar II Depression,Irritability_ anger_ weight loss_ constipation_ elation_ can't sleep,I have recently started taking 300 mg. wellbutrin after having taken neurontin_ lithium_ geodon_ synthroid and klonopin.  Now I only take lamictal_ wellbutrin and geodon.  I feel annoyed and have had fights with strangers but I hope this side effect dissipates with time.  Strangely_ I feel more social.  I also have less depression and can control binge eating.  The wellbutrin helped me stop smoking altogether (and I smoked a pack a day for 25 years.)  My problem is isolation_ but once I get out of the house I can function very well.  I hope the side effects of anger go away because this is the best combination of medication I've had so far.  Constipation very bad but use ducolax (ugh).,F,40,2  weeks,4/21/2005,Wellbutrin xl

1379, 5, Severe chronic depression,ringing in ears_ trembling in my hands_ weight loss (which I needed)_ constipation_ occasional dry mouth_ (on the SR-->) terrible stomach pains so I was put on XL to alleviate that and it worked,I was on and off Wellbutrin for 9 years. I had treatment resistent depression and tried Zoloft_ Paxil_ Remeron_ Depakote...so many I've forgotten now and the first time I was put on Wellbutrin I would say it saved my life. I weighed 240 pounds and ended up at 160. When it reached it's plateau I went off of it and tried another drug I gained 30 pounds. When that new drug didn't help me I was off all drugs for 2 awful years and finally went back on Wellbutrin 1 year ago and have lost those 30 pounds. My main complaint with the SR was the stomach pains but the XL is heaven sent as far as I am concerned. I dread the next plateau because that means 1 year+ of possible depression again. But I will ONLY come back to Wellbutrin for the rest of my life. P.S. All other anti-depressants killed my libido however Wellbutrin has solved that problem.,F,33,9  years,4/16/2005,Wellbutrin xl

Did not feel totally exhausted after exercise on the second day_ which was a blessing.  But in the next few days the depression and suicidal thoughts gradually returned_ still not able to sleep_ started to hyperventilate_ have very rapid heartbeat_ bad headaches and stiff neck_ and would also burst into uncontrollable tears_ snapped at and was generally impatient with everyone.  Doctor took me off it this week and other options will be looked into.   Drug working its way out of system now_ feel like I'm strapped to a cinderblock backpack.
