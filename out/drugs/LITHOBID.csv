0, 1, Bipolar,Weight gain and trembling hands,,F,36, 100 MG 2X D,5/3/2013Email,Lithobid
1, 5, BiPolar 2 / Cyclothymic,None to speak of. Lithobid about 7 years now. Prior used Eskalith (900 mg) [1987 Started on lithium capsules_ then tried the liquid. Stomach upset was a problem]No libido issues_ no weight gain. I do need to make sure I drink a lot of water.,"When I was diagnosed 25 odd years ago_ I was told I was BiPolar II. I had mostly depressive episodes_ always in the winter. I became hypomanic and it was strongly suggested by my Psychiatrist to go on Lithium. Today I feel my cycling was more due to cyclothymic mood disorder_ but the Dx may not have existed in the '80's. Lithium was still fairly new to use day-to-day as it was mostly used to quell full-blown manic episodes.Although I have had side-effects of dulled feelings_ at this time I do not have the ""cotton-wool"" feeling_ where my emotions are blunted down_ but that is because I take what is considered a barely therapeutic dose. My levels are always in the proper range_ however.Additionally_ I take 150MG of Lamictal and 50MG Trazodone. The Traz pops just the right amount of serotonin. I take at night before bed_ and I wake up happy. Much better than with Lith and Lamictal alone.Stabilized for many years. Depressed moods are usually reactionary_ and no hypomania. Gee that part was the best! Nothing like a little hypomanic road trip. Crash and burn thoughÂ…",F,54,25  years600 MG 1X D,1/20/2012,Lithobid
2, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,LITHOBID gave me my life back. It virtually eliminated my suicidal tendencies and helped with my self harm. I do however_ experience long term persistent diarrhea after every time I eat.,,F,18,9  months100. Total,12/1/2011Email,Lithobid
3, 2, Bipolar,Stopped taking as took before and weight gain and bloating was horrible lost 40 lbs when I went off this drug in approximately 2006,was on abilify for 5 yrs had severe depression issues in 2009 and 2010 only one manic issue in feb mar and april 2009 started mania in march 2011 given depakpote and now lithobid won't take due to above,F,65,8  days300 mg 3X D,4/25/2011Email,Lithobid
4, 4, bipor II,Definitely blurred vision. It took me awhile to realize since I wear glasses_ suffer from allergies and have long eyelashes. But yup_ blurred vision_ but no other discernable side effect.,It works to level me off_ to be sure_ but since it is blurring my vision I will probably return to my old 'script_ a generic lithium,M,47,3  weeks100 mg 2X D,3/2/2011Email,Lithobid
5, 1, Bipolar,anger_ weight gain_ gas_ bloating_ diarrhea_ throwing up_ migraines_ insomnia_ anxiety_ loss of reality_ thirsty all the time_ blurred vision_ excess salivia_ acne_ loss of balance...Theses are my side effects from only 3 weeks of use,I have only been on this for a short amount of time_ but the side effects are not worth staying on it.  I did a little better on lithium.  I can't say that I wouldn't recommend this to anyone_ because people respond to meds differently.  For me_ I can't wait till this stuff gets out of my system.,F,37,3  weeks1800 mg 6X D,2/5/2011,Lithobid
6, 1, posible bipolar,major weight gain_ not myself what so ever I gained like 30 or more pounds and for a while I did not think that the weight gain was not the Lithoid but it was and now it is hard to lose the weight.,Do not use if under the age of 18,F,17,6  years,6/12/2009Email,Lithobid
7, 4, Extreme Mood Swings,Dizziness_ Trembling hands_ excessive urination_ stomach pain_ Increased thirst,Not too bad_ trembling in my hands and body sometimes becomes a bit too much and embarrassing_ but tremor only happens after a workout_ in a stressful situation_ or if I concentrate on holding something tight (water bottle/ can_ phone) and the tremor shows up randomly.,F,19,5  months,5/31/2009,Lithobid
8, 1, ptsd/ depression,agitation_ confusion_ suicidal thoughts,I am on a combination of celexa and welbutrin for depression and valium to help with night terrors; xanax PRN. I took lithobid for 3 days. The first day i experienced severe agitation and confusion but thought it was anxiety related to my new rx. By the third day i felt like there was something invading my body that I had to physically extract. Suicide was my first solution to my awkward state_ so i decided to sleep it off (19hrs straight) and dc use.,F,21,3  days,3/31/2009,Lithobid
9, 4, Bipolar,Hidratenitus ( really really really bad cystic acne). I was cutting 5 cysts open a day. The acne was painful!!!! When i finally went off lithium_ i had over 500 acnes scars on my back_ 100 scars in my but and legs_ and some on my face. I couldn't even walk the acne was so painful. weight gain ( but i was taking depakote and seraquel too)_ craving sweets!!!!,Most people don't get hidroatenitus from lithobid_ it's usually a great drug_ but if acne shows up when you take it_ don't doubt the fact that its from lithobid! Great for mania though!,M,19,5  years,12/3/2008Email,Lithobid
10, 5, Bi Polar,After taking lithium which did not work for me at all. The change to Lithobid the only side effects was minor weight gain_dry mouth.,With the help of this drug_ counseling and myself_ have not had a episode in 21 years. The most important thing to know not just one thing helps it takes all three. Continue to take medicines no matter which one helps you.,F,62,21  years,12/2/2008Email,Lithobid
11, 3, Recommended,Thirst_ anxiety_ disorientation_ fuzzy feeling_ loss of short term memory_ anger_ frustration_ not 'getting it'_ out of touch.,On lithium to control mania_ but anxiety quickly followed along with the side effects. Ambien at 6.25mg (1 at bedtime and 1 after 4 hours) got sleep patterns back after a week_ then began reducing the lithium to get back out of the side effects. It worked the last time too. Seems good sleeping habits and exercise helps stay out of the mania pattern. Does anyone else have poor sleeping habits that eventually lead to mania episodes?,F,45,14  days,1/17/2008,Lithobid
12, 1, possible bi-polar,"extreme muscle tremors_ dry mouth_ thirst_ ""out of body"" feeling","i was on lithium regularly for six months to stabilize my mood. in this time i experienced tremors to the point that i could not write legibly_ do my beadwork_ or do yoga (because my muscles shook so badly i couldn't hold myself up). i also felt extremely robotized_ like i was living in a dream. i almost got in a few potentially serious accidents because i was ""out of it"" while driving. the doctor reduced the dosage and this helped calm the shaking_ but my hands still trembled and all the other side effects remained. in addition_ my mood did not improve one bit; i became even more volatile than i had been before. i was finally taken off of it after my fourth stay in a psychiatric hospital in less than four months.",F,20,6  months,12/5/2007,Lithobid
13, 4, bipolar 2 (rapid cycling),thirst_ salty taste in my mouth_ dry skin_ reduced libido_ possibly some cognitive issues with memory,This medication has been very helpful. It's not perfect_ but it has a strong_ measurable stabilizing effect on me. I'm willing to take it despite the side effects. Lower doses in combination with other meds (Lamictal_ Well-Butrin_ Invega_ Risperdal) have reduced the side effects. It felt like a bright light came on when I started taking it. I did quit cold-turkey one time and had a severe suicidal rebound it took divine intervention to get me out of. Do NOT quit taking this medicine cold turkey.,F,37,4  years,7/26/2007,Lithobid
14, 2, Bipolar II & Depression,"Weight gain (21 lbs in 4 or 5 months)_ Extreme tremors (to the point where my hand writing was getting ugly and it was hard to do my makeup)_ acne_ uninary tract problems_ sleeping all the time_ seemed ""out of my own body"" at times.",I was taking 900 MG Lithobid and 450 MG Wellbutrin XL_ the Lithobid did not make me feel any better_ actually worse. I stuck it out to see if i got any better but didnt. My doctor did not wean me off of the Lithobid_ he took me off all at once which was a horrible idea. I was really edgy and had no patience for anyone. I was crying more and yelling at everyone. This medicine worked for my father_ but the weight gain and tremors were not worth waiting any longer to find out.,F,18,6  months,6/27/2007Email,Lithobid
15, 3, bipolar disorder,thirsty_ trembing fingers at times_ constipation_ no energy,Wish there were a way to wean a person off of this to see if they really need it...I'm feeling better now and would like to know if it truly does help me by the weaning off_ though I know that sounds illogical.  this drug slows a person down_ makes them tired_ lose energy.  You know you have things to do_ but you are so tired to do them is difficult.  I want my energy back.,F,50,2  days,4/25/2007,Lithobid
16, 5, bipolar I,tremors_ weight gain (about 5 lbs/300 mg)_ hypothyrodism_ increase in thirst_ gritty skin,I've tried abilify_ depakote_ zyprexa_ and tegretol.  So far this has worked the best for me in terms of side effects and fixing what I wanted it to fix (stablizing my mood).  I switched to time release when I started getting frequent nausea_ diahrea_ and stomachs after taking my pills.  Time release has been well worth the extra $$.,F,29,12  years,4/11/2007,Lithobid
17, 4, Bipolar Disorder - Mostly Manic,Irregular bowels_ some nauseaus when I have an empty stomache_ dry mouth_ acne at first - then it totally subsided_ curlier hair_ and bloating - these of which were easier to deal with.  The eight years I've been taking this medicine_ I've gained about 35 lbs.  I'm not happy about that.,For me_ Lithobid (lithium) works.  It has greatly reduced the more severe bipolar symptoms such as anger (I can especially see this when dealing with my children)_ uncontrolable manic episodes and extreme depression periods in my life.  It's not that these things don't happen_ like the anger and depression_ it is that when they do_ they are not as severe and I feel like I am in more controll.  Everyone has more happy and more sad days_ with lithobid I still feel the different moods but not to the extreme that I might have if I had not been taking anything.  It is possible there aren't as many dangerous mood swings either.  Other than a few mild side effects_ I could hardly tell I was taking anything.  It has been my family that has helped me to see that it is working.  I will say_ however_ that the bloating and weight gain has been no fun.  The sadness of the weight gain has caused me to stop taking the medicaton a few times_ but I quickly realize that I NEED and must take the Lithobid,F,32,8  years,2/11/2007Email,Lithobid
18, 5, Bipolar Disorder,lethargy and difficulty concentrating/cognitive difficulties. i had tremors_ blurry vision_ slurred speech_ and extreme sleepiness in the beginning but they went away within a couple of weeks.,The difficulty concentrating and the cognitive problems have been the worst for me because it makes it unbelievably difficult to get through school. But for me it's been a miracle drug. I'd been on dozens of different meds before they put me on lithium when I was 14_ and it was the first to ever make a positive difference. The side effects are completely worth it for me_ and I feel that it would still be worth it for me even if my side effects were worse. Lithium saved my life.,F,18,4  years,1/30/2007,Lithobid
19, 3, bipolar,Restless leg syndrom all over my body_ random twitches_ shaky  hands_ nasseau and loss of appetite_ keep seeing a trail when objects move_ i can still see the object moments after it is gone_ EXTREME ANXIETY ATTACKS!!! to the maxxxxx,I dont know if i like it_ i dont know if the sideaffects are worth it.,F,16,1  days,1/5/2007,Lithobid

22, 2, bipolar disorder,horrible bloating all over_ rapid weight gain_ thyroid problem worsened_ and I developed what the doctor called restless leg syndrome--except this was more like restless body syndrome.  It was hell!,a last resort medication,F,46,2  weeks,12/26/2006,Lithobid
23, 2, Bi-polar possible BPD,Frequent unrination. Loss of bladder control. Ringing in ears.,My BF claims he noticed a difference in my behavior. I did feel more balanced but I missed having emotions. I missed feeling human.About taking it after a week_ I had this horrible ringing in my right ear. It was so loud I cringed every time it happened. Than came the frequent urination. It was so bad one night I pissed the bed. How do you think a 23 year old feels when that happeneds? I stopped taking right away.,F,23,2  weeks,8/22/2006Email,Lithobid
24, 1, bipolar I disorder,apathy_ lack of motivation_ rastlessness_ disphoria.,this medication was not good for me It gave me symptoms similar to depression. I was sleepy all day and I did not want to do anything but sleep. it kind of made me question wheather I really suffered from bipolar disorder and if my psychosis had a different origin.,M,21,4  months,8/1/2006,Lithobid
25, 3, yes,Weight gain (15-20 lbs),It helped initially but the extra pouns I could ndeal with. Isd rather be crazy than fat!,M,39,1  years,7/26/2006,Lithobid
26, 5, mood swings/possible bipolar II,nausea (though far less than straight Lithium Carbonate)_ recent development of slight hand tremor,Lithobid has been the LEAST problematic medication I have ever been on. It has had a really positive impact; my mood swings_ which were once quite radical_ have subsided. I also really like that a simple blood draw can tell your MD what your level is -- it takes a lot of the guess work out of things.,F,21,1  years,6/4/2006,Lithobid
27, 2, Bipolar,It also caused thyroid problems and made me constantly thirsty - also my skin was dried out while I was on it.,,F,19,4  years,4/1/2006,Lithobid
28, 2, Bipolar Depression,it rotted my teeth_ it gave me awful acne_ it made me uncontrollably hungry at night_ I gained at least 80 lbs in 3 years. My behavior became worse and I had anxiety attacks. I was irritable.,This medication isn't worth it. It helped a little at first but by the time I stopped taking it I was worse than when I started it! It rotted my teeth so bad I had to have root canals on most of my teeth_ had to have some pulled_ and the rest all have big fillings. I spent the entire 4 years I was on this going to the dentist. It made me hungry at night so badly I felt like I couldn't sleep and was being DROVE to do so or I couldn't sleep although this may also have been the Serquel_ I'm not sure. I gained so much weight nobody could recognize me and within 4 months of coming off the medication had lost about 75% of it without trying. I've also heard it can cause worse problems - like people starting fires.,F,18,4  years,4/1/2006,Lithobid
29, 3, BiPolar 2 and severe depression,25-lb. weight gain in two weeks_ no sweets as I am a salad person_ and fix two meals per week_ either fish or chicken plus baked tator! Naseua_ diarehia_ constipation_ shakes_ memory loss_ lethargy. Concetration sucks. Scared to go outside in public for fear if people look into my eyes they'll know how screwed up I am. However_ I did have a wonderful day (3 days ago) 1st time in six months! Funny_ I wondered if this was manic or just nice Day!! HA! But_I spriral down severely yet_and it sucks.,I was diagnosed with this 10 yrs ago_tried the lithium_ however quit_ due to my denial of being bi-polar. Taken Zoloft since I was 20_ now upped to 200 mg for last 6 mo._ Doc now added 200 mg Lamictal_ plus Seroquel and Klonapin for panic attacks.  I hate taking all these meds_ but KNOW that I need Lithobid_ so will continue. Sad at my age that I've never had a weight problem til now_ most men don't give a 'chunky woman a chance_ they forget the woman's soul.'  Having been single for 13 yrs_ I know that most of my dates started w/my beauty_ (NOT bragging)_ then it led to knowing my soul.' Crap this is a nightmare...thought I'd someday find my soulmate...not now. Weightgain+bipoler=lonliness! Please forgive my mispelling-memory loss.,F,50,2  weeks,3/31/2006Email,Lithobid
30, 5, Bipolar II disorder,hand tremors/diarrhea/nausea(sometimes extreme) frequent urination_ tiredness_ sleepiness_ constant thirst,I've been taking Lithium in some form or another for almost 10 years. I really don't think it contributed to my overall weight gain_ I've always been overweight. It was a real lifesaver. It really began to effect me positively when I took 1200 mg daily. This is not a medication that you want to stop and start either as it may lose its' effectiveness with you if you do this. Some of its' overall long-term side effects are concerning however. Also_ not a drug to use if alcohol plays a large role in your life. The liver can't process both well at the same time.,F,34,9  years,12/28/2005,Lithobid
31, 5, Mixed bipolar II,Tremor_ which has recently subsided... hypothyroidism within the first two weeks_ which I take synthroid for... my thyroid levels are now normal. I am a bit more bloated than I used to be_ though.,I wish that I had tried lithium sooner. On that note_ I've found that lithobid is more effective than lithium bicarbonate_ and so I use it despite the steep price increase. It is nothing like atypical antipsychotics_ which killed me even at the smallest dosages. It's really been a lifesaver. I use it 600 mg_ with lamictal 100 mg_ with zonegran 50 mg_ and with concerta 36 mg.,F,17,1  years,12/12/2005,Lithobid
32, 4, BiPolar I (rapid cycling),Weakness_ lethargy_ chronic thirst_ weight gain (5-8 lbs)_ forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating.,I've fought taking Lithium for nearly ten years and have finally admitted in the last year that life is just easier when I take my meds and stay on them.  All the side effects I've listed are much more minor than I experienced on Eskalith and I have none of the nausea.,F,24,7  years,7/28/2005,Lithobid
33, 3, bipolar 2,Weight gain. Carb cravings. Oily hair and skin.,I would like to find a better way of dealing with bi-polar.Because of all the side effects I've had.It has only helped my moods to an extent not totally.,F,26,2  years,7/1/2005,Lithobid
