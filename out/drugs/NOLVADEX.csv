1, 1, ER+ stage-0 cancer_ caught on MRI o,ER+ cancer cells_ stage-0_ in-situ contained in one milk duct_ right breast_ not seen on either mammogram nor ultrasound_ but found accidentally on MRI. Had masectomy_ plus diep flap. No radiation nor chemo required. Two months after surgery_ started Tamoxifen but 3 weeks of using it_ developed adverse reaction with hives and swelling and oozing broken skin on neck. Had to go to emergency and given 10mg benedryl and zantac plus betaderm cream to ease condition. Stopped using tamoxifen immediately. Now I am on Femara. It has only been 2 weeks. Drug reaction_ if any_ is seen after 3-4 weeks_ the time allotted for impact on estrogen levels in body. Also I already have had autoimmune disease_ psoriasis_ for 30 yrs_ so I do not know what effects of meds to lower estrogen_ like Femara would have on my body. Tamoxifen did not work with me. My concern surrounds having an autoimmune disease like psoriasis_ and the impact of Estrogen lowering meds on body.,,F,57,3  weeks,6/16/2014Email,Nolvadex
2, 3, breast cancer,"Initially the hot flashes were really  hard_ to an extreme.  My mood began to fluctuate.  It felt very much like a ""chemical depression.""

3, 4, Breast Cancer Invasive Stage 1B,I'm not sure.  I can't pinpoint anything specific to Tamoxifen (everything can be explained away) but I THINK.. I have lots of joint pain_ brain fog and nausea.  Had Major Hot Flashes and Night Sweats_ which may be tapering off.,Overall_ for the piece of mind that Tamoxifen may allow me to have extra time with my kids_ I take it.  I try not to attribute my aches and pains (and there are many) to Tamoxifen but it's possible that it's the culprit to many of them.  Back_ leg_ joint pain.  Brain Fog_ nausea.  I still have to take nausea medications 2-3 mornings per week... no biggie to me though.  I went through medical menopause 1 1/2 years ago and they're getting ready to switch me to Arimadex.  I hope I handle it well also but if not_ I'd easily be persuaded to go back to Tamoxifen.  It was bearable for me.,F,44,2  years20 1X D,1/4/2014Email,Nolvadex

Also keeping a hand fan around helps.,Took for 3   (age 51-54) years before switching to Arimidex because my oncologist figured I was post-menopause.

I've gained 10lbs and no matter what I try_ I can't loose it. I used to have regular bowel movements but now I have to take additional measures. I had slight tinnitus before but now it's noticeably worse. I also have unexplained upper back pain. I take Melatonin to help me get through the night.

Side effects are supposed to be uncommon and I am so sad that these many posts are about very bad side effects. I will quit taking tamoxifen because the 2009 Christopher Li et al study shows that 25% of 5 year tamoxifen takers get a non-ER-positive (a much worse cancer) in the other breast. Endometrial cancer chances are indeed small_ 1 in 3000_ but 1 in 4 for a contralateral worse cancer is a humongous freaking chance.,,F,51,4  months20 1X D,2/9/2011Email,Nolvadex

There's history of blood clots (strokes) in my family & Dr didn't want to put me on TAMOXIFEN because of that. ARIMIDEX has lower occurrence of blood clots_ but I struggled with extreme side effects on Arimidex for 6mo. & it was crippling me with severe joint & bone pain all over my body. At the 5 yr mark Dr tried FEMARA & was on that for 5yrs very successfully. Few noticeable side effects other than thinning hair & weight gain. At 10yr mark Dr took me off of everything (6mo ago) except annual iv for ZOMETA which I also tolerated well. Dr switched to RECLAST & I have joint pain & bone pain from that. I attribute my 10yrs in cancer remission to TAMOXIFEN_ FEMARA & GOD.

However_ the thought of a reoccurrence is truly terrifying so I decided to give it a go and I've been lucky so far.

35, 1, Breast CA Stage II_ 1 positive node,For the first five months on Tamoxifen I experienced only hot flashes and vaginal discharge.  The hot flashes have been severe.  I would be constantly breaking out in a sweat and feeling as if I was on fire.  Breaking out in a sweat ten times during a shift at work was very inconvenient and uncomfortable.  I was soaking through my clothes.  These sweats and hot flashes interferred with sleep.  I was only able to sleep for short periods and then would be awake the rest of the night.  I couldn't get comfortable.  After five months I began developing arthritis in my hands.  My left thumb has been very painful now for four months.  Both hands feel stiff and hurt.  I also had transient joint pain in the lower back_ hips_ and shoulders.  Around this same time I began having terrible fatigue.  I was a marathon runner when I was dx'd with cancer and continued to run through the chemo and before and after my mastectomy/reconstruction surgery.  During months 6 through 8 on Tamoxifen_ I began to,After three weeks without Tamoxifen_ I feel so much better.  I didn't even make it a year on Tamoxifen.  I went into this with an open mind believing in the importance of taking it.  It seems to me that the damage Tamoxifen can cause due to short and long term side effects is SIGNIFICANT.  My question is why are the drug companies and the doctors reinforcing the idea that side effects are minimal to noexistent?  If they lie about this then why should I have any faith in their so-called studies?,F,48,8  months,9/22/2009Email,Nolvadex

My doctor_ pharmacist and another breast cancer patient assured me that severe side effects weren't common and I'm glad that I listened to them.  I'm blessed in that my side effects have been minimal and the drug is not bothering me.  It's important to realize that the chemistry that makes up our bodies is different and that bad side effects exist with some patients and not others.  So_ keep an open mind if you're going to be taking the drug and go in to it with a positive attitude.  I'm confident that this drug will help prevent recurrance of the cancer in my body.,F,45,5  months,8/14/2009,Nolvadex

I was also taking Paxil at the time_ and I attributed the weight gain to that_ but it was probably the Tamoxifen.  Didn't have hot flashes then because of the Paxil_ or depression.  I have since read that Paxil interferes with Tamoxifen_ making it less effective against progression_ so can't go on it this time around.,F,59,2  months,7/21/2009,Nolvadex
39, 2, to prevent breast cancer recurrence,pelvic pain_ uterine cramping_ severe anxiety attacks and vaginal discharge,I have a history of panic disorder_ always dealt with it with no meds_just relaxation exercises.  The panic from the Tamoxifen is nearly crippling- probably because it changes the hormonal balance_ even though I had an uneventful menopause as well as happy pregnancies. Also_ the pelvic pain is unsettling - no one knows what it is_ even after two ultrasounds.  But it's there and I don't know if I can continue on this medication.MD's say anxiety and pelvic pain are not symptoms - not so.the pelvic pain is very unpleasant,F,61,14  days,7/14/2009,Nolvadex

After 2 years had significant hand & bottom of foot swelling/pain especially in the morning.  Also_ constant throbbing in lower legs_ cramps in feet & calves_ numbness in arms when bent.  I tried switching to raloxifene (Evista) but that made me mentally confused and I feared for losing my job. So I stopped Evista after 4 months.

It will be 4 years in October that I have been cancer free.  I was only cancer free 11 months after chemo so this is great to me!  It is impossible to know if the tamoxifen is what is keeping the cancer at bay_ but my oncologist expects I'll be on it forever.  I truly hate the hot flashes which are severe.  I am a children's librarian and sometimes when I do stories for classes I'll sweat so much I'll drip on the pages of the book.  I am very self conscious about this_ but except for taking effexor there is nothing I can do.  I'd rather be alive than dry.  The memory problems are scary and make me less effective at work.

55, 1, stage 1 bc_ lumpectomy er+,Shortness of breath_ dizziness_ fatigue_ low grade fever_ calf cramps_ hip and back pain_ confusion_ memory loss_ minor night sweats,I have been taking Tamoxifen for 2 years with a 5 month break (July 07-Dec 07). I started getting all these side effects after a year and onco didn't think it was the meds. I went off of the med for 5 months and felt fantastic-all the side effects went away. Started taking the meds again Dec. 1_ now all the side effects have returned. I will be going off Tamoxifen in 2 wks and trying Lupron/Arimidex_ but am terrified of feeling even worse. If the Lupron/Arimidex are as horrible as I keep hearing they are_ I will seriously consider stopping all the meds.

59, 4, stage 1 bc lumpectomy,Constipation_ hot flashes_ vaginal discharge,I started taking Tamoxifen last August after two_ terrible years of joint pain and weight gain caused by taking Arimidex and Aromasin.  At first my doctor prescribed 20mg per day_ but I did not react well and became so constipated that I did not want to continue the treatment.  The doctor advised me to try taking half the amount_ i.e. 10 mg daily.  He said that for those patients who metabolize slowly 10 mg were sufficient.  Since changing to 10mg I have felt much better and have only occasional constipation.  I still have hot flashes_ especially in the evening_ but not so severe as before_ and I no longer have the joint pains I had with Arimidex and Aromasin.,F,65,1  years,4/10/2008Email,Nolvadex
