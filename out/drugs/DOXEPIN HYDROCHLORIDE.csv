0, 1, My Dr was a fool,This is just an update on my experience with this drug. I am still very sick from my Dr combining this with other things I was taking and this is NOT a safe drug for long term use...unless one thinks dementia is okay. This drug has been found to cause dementia which can be very serious. This drug is also the second most toxic antidepressant in overdose which means the drug is quite toxic overall. I would not touch this or another antidepressant with a ten foot pole unless I was desperate to ruin my life. A number of reviews on websites seem to be written by people employed by the company making this drug because the side effects are horrendous from this drug. If this was a natural supplement it would've been pulled off the market within a week I figure. Very dangerous med made in Germany and tested in Swiss psychiatric institutions...need I say more?,See above.,M,41,2  weeks,4/15/2016,Doxepin hydrochloride
1, 5, INSOMNIA,NO side effects other than sleeping 7-8 hours at night and feeling energetic the next day!,I have had insomnia for 7 years and have tried everything_ natural and prescription_ out there. Finally only 6mg. of DOXEPIN ELIXIR  has me sleeping 7-8 hours at night. In low doses (10mg and under_ but usually 3-6mg)_ it is a very potent anti-histamine and is VERY safe to use long term. I am finally sleeping like a baby and feel like a new person!! Yay!,M,51,2  months 1X D,3/7/2016Email,Doxepin hydrochloride
2, 1, Due to not being able to sleep,I was started at 10 mg. At bedtime. Within a couple months was moved to 50 mg. I have not been well since I started taking this medicine. It has made things way worse and has put me back into another state of depression. I am stopping this medicine today and after reading some of the comments here_ I am not sure yet if it's been the cause of my nausea. I have also gained a good twenty pounds as well. The only reason I was ever put on it in the first place was because I changed doctors and they changed up my medicine on me immediately due to my need for xanax. Xanax has helped me for more than twenty plus years but just because idiots are over dosing or what they want to refer to as getting high. Xanax does not get me high and if I didn't take them I could be at big risk of ceasures and I would not get any rest at night_ I would be anxious hyper and have even had black outs in a hospital and they had no idea what was wrong. I am very upset that doctors can just take your medicine from you that has been working well for years and there is nothing you can do except Chase down doctors which they even want to say it's illegal to doctor shop. What are we to do? I know for a fact if these doctors and the d.e.a. we're feeling these symptoms_ they would not have any troubles bumping up a doctor to write them there medicine and I don't care who you are. I was wowed at the fact I had plainly told this new doctor that I was doing good till he switched up my medicine on me and further tha,,F,44,4  months50 mg.,2/27/2016,Doxepin hydrochloride

11, 1, As needed for sleep.,"Doctor prescribed 50mg tabs and said take as many or as little as it takes to get sleep. I'd usually take 2 every night to fall asleep and suddenly GAINED WEIGHT...EXTREMELY FAST!!! OVERNIGHT REALLY!!! ! Literally woke one morning and NOTHING fit! My BF of MANY MANY years said I was a disgusting fat ass and moved out! Gained 25lb+ in 5 weeks!!! Eating sweets like a heroine addict! Was thinking diabetes or CHF was my troubles. I'm 38 in 1 month and had my tubes removed several years ago but took a preg test last week just to make sure bc it's all in my gut! People at work are asking me left & right what's going on!! Someone said today ""my stomach looks huge""Also developed *migraines *redness all over (like niacin) *tingling hands (have consult for carpal tunnel_ but after reading now I see I can cancel the appt) *restless arms & legs at night like creepy crawly skin_ *constipation *sore throat for a month now *dry mouth *extreme thirst! Did I mention *EXTREME weight gain. This may be good for people who NEED to gain but if someone is of a healthy weight- weight conscious_ I wouldn't recommend",I'd rather lose sleep than gain weight! I struggled with weight all thru my 20s_ worked liked hell to lose it around 30 & for the past 6 years could eat whatever I liked and as much as I liked and never gain an ounce_ now I'm almost in that same size clothes as my 20s. STOPPING NOW! Pills in the trash already!!! I'll deal with whatever before I gain another ounce! Now I can rule out throat cancer_ carpal tunnel_ and diabetes since I've read others common side effects. It's like a light bulb has come on and everything makes sense now about my ailing body for the past few weeks. Strangely_ the people around my age group have complained mostly of the same side effects compared to other age groups! Hmmmm,F,37,5  weeks50-100mg,10/20/2015Email,Doxepin hydrochloride

14, 1, doctor added it to Prozac for insomnia,Had stomach removed in 2013 due to gi cancer_& other parts. Oncologist made me a small pouch connected directly from esophagus to jejunum_ as I lost duodenum. I struggled to weigh 125_ with incredible problems. Literally within 1 month I gained 20 lbs_ mostly in abdominal area_ face broke out with a type of bumps that don't respond to anything. Migraines worse_ body aches_ severe insomnia. He knows my med history yet prescribed this knowing my pouch can rupture. I have no stomach_duodenum_ & had a small bowel resection. I've weaned myself off_& am on the strict regimen for my condition. I craved sweets like a maniac on doxepin_ whereas they nauseated me before. I'm very concerned. I developed esophogitis_which have the same symptoms as throat cancer. My gi doc immediately did an endoscopy_& biopsy_lucky it was esophogitis. The bad part is that where my pouch_ fake stomach is suture to my jejunum_ it's stretched & inflammed_ which compromised the ability to stay properly connected. I'm terrified that I won't lose this 20 lbs now. And the outcome could be quite serious. Does anyone have long term knowledge on if the weight goes away permanently after stopping doxepin?

16, 1, depression,Vicious nightmares_ extreme sedation_ depression.,This med is beyond evil. Anyone that writes anything positive about this med is beyond me. My Dr (Sloan) was extremely careless in prescribing this med and it actually made my depression 10 times worse. After taking this med for two days I told my fiance that I wanted to stop it_ being as understanding as she was_ she demanded I keep taking it. Two weeks later I was rushed to the hospital with severe injuries to my body because my Dr's bad advice mixing this med with other medications etc. I should have never taken this med or any meds for depression...they don't work anyways! Since taking this med I have thought of suicide well over 100_000 times easily_ I would've been better off taking NOTHING than taking this crap. Antidepressants can cause depression_ if that isn't proof they don't work...I don't know what is. BTW_  this med was made in 1962 in Germany and that isn't too long after Hitler and I would eat my shorts if his Dr's weren't behind this monstrosity. I read the clinical observations of this med and they claimed it had excellent antidepressant effects. Well_ there isn't an antidepressant on earth that can claim that so you know where they can shove this stuff...sideways. If our governments weren't so corrupt_ THEY would do the actual testing of these garbage meds and NONE would get approved! Calling this med crap is an understatement if there ever was one_ I really hope I die and before I took this med I was okay.

19, 4, Immune disorder-chronic hives/angioedema,Dry mouth_ rapid weight gain,This medicine immediately took care of all of my allergic reactions (hives and facial/neck swelling) and helped me fall asleep and stay asleep all night. At first_ it would immediately knock me out for like 10-12 hours and I would wake up groggy and drowsy. After a couple of days_ it still put me to sleep but I started waking up refreshed. The Doxepin_ however_ caused me to gain 23 lbs. in just a month and a half!!! I did not change my eating and/or exercise habits and I was not taking anything else so the weight gain was definitely a result of this medication. Because of this_ the allergist is now weaning me off of the Doxepin and giving me something new in a few weeks if I start having allergic reactions again. He said only a small percentage of people gain weight from it but it definitely slowed my metabolism down rapidly. I am not taking it again!,F,23,6  weeks 1X D,8/17/2015Email,Doxepin hydrochloride

But i shed 12 pounds in less than a week. I am going to the doctor to beg to be put back on Ambien. I honestly think i am dying from fluid suffocating my heart. This stuff feels too dangerous to be worth the benefit of sleeping. I sweat to death and it makes my skin crawl_ my boney legs look like tree trunks. I went from a size 10 to a size 18!!!!! I wouldn't give this to my worst enemy. There are a LOT better regimes than this out there!!!!

I was tired and had no energy. After a few tests_ my doctor diagnosed me with Early Awakening Syndrome_ which means that you fall asleep but cannot stay asleep.

29, 4, panic depression anxiety phobia,the side effects are  beneficial--makes you drowsy_ good for insomnia. Not as good as a SSRi for OCD or phobias,I have taken this drug off and on for 28 years_ it is my 'old standby'. Maybe not the best antidepressant (I took 50 MG. three times a day in 1986)_ however_ I now take it to counteract the side-effects of Prozac which I also take (10 MG. every other day). Apparently it blocks the 5ht2a receptor which Prozac stimulates making this SSRi more tolerable for me. I take it a bedtime and the benefits last thru the next day. Much higher doses are needed to get a mild antidepressant effect but it will make you very groggy in the morning for about 2-3 hours. It's inexpensive_ anyone without insurance can afford the generic form.,M,50,28  years25 MG. 1X D,10/8/2014Email,Doxepin hydrochloride

Vivid_ lengthy dreams_ but no PTSD related nightmares_ so that is a plus. Groggy/drowsy for about an hour or so in the mornings. Some loss of concentration_ ""heavy/fuzzy"" feeling in head. No weight gain as of yet_ but I have noticed some bloating in my abdomen. Currently weigh 125lbs. A major positive is that my nervous stomach has nearly disappeared. Used to have almost constant nausea/vomitting/diarrhea associated with stress/nerves before I began this med. It has been an amazing change. The most negative side effect for me has been the anger/irritability. I literally feel like I could snap any minute_ and the smallest things set me off nowadays. Much more bitchy than usual. Psychiatrist says that should pass in a few more weeks though. Impressed with the quality and amount of sleep I have been getting since starting Doxepin. That in itself truly makes a difference for me. Best wishes to anyone who decides to give it a try.

I found relieve for my constant headaches for a long time! I didn't have to take as much pain medication while I was on Doxepin.  The only thing was that after three years the result started to fade and an increase in the dosage didn't make a difference in the reoccurrence of the headaches.I tapered off_ taking sthg else for the headaches at that point.Now it's Neurontin that I take_ and it seems to work.,,F,44,5  years50 MG,2/2/2013Email,Doxepin hydrochloride
54, 1, Insomnia_ depression,SIGNIFICANT weight gain...about 40 lbs in 5 months.  Dry mouth that was uncomfortable but tolerable.,Worked well for sleep for me...I fall asleep almost exactly 2 hours after I take it.  Helped stabilize mood and improved some symptoms of depression.  Maybe more vivid dreams than usual.  Major problem: Fast_ significant weight gain.  I mentioned side effect to my MD and he suggested diet and exercise.  I have been much better about both_ but weight gain continues just as fast as it did before_ mostly around belly.  Friends and family have tactfully mentioned my abrupt change in body type and have said they are worried about me.  Had to buy all new clothes since nothing fits me anymore.  It is getting to the point where I feel so terrible about my body that I hate going out in public. I avoid windows and mirrors so I can't see my reflection.  It is not worth it for me anymore.  I probably should have gone off much sooner.  I have been tapering off over the last 3 weeks.  Experiencing some headaches from withdrawal but I can deal with that.  Now if only the pounds would disappear as fast as they came on......,F,25,5  months200mg 1X D,1/20/2013,Doxepin hydrochloride

While it has helped my migraines_ the weight gain_ sweets craving_ horrible nightmares_ and dry mouth outweigh the benefits for me. The nightmares are so bad. In the last 6 months_ I have awakened my husband probably 20 times thinking that whatever I was dreaming about was real and I was deathly afraid. I stopped taking Doxepin 3 days ago_ and while I've not felt any withdrawal symptoms_ I am still having terrible nightmares. I have lost about 2 pounds in those 3 days though. The day after I stopped Doxepin_ I had 0 cravings (Thank goodness). Another problem I'm having with my discontinued use is severe insomnia. I've slept 3.5 hours in the last 2 nights.

Not worth it at all!,Did not work last night (slept maybe 3-4 hours fitfully) from around 4 am and was wide awake at 7 am_ no drowsiness the next day!  No weird reactions_ crap just did nothing!  Ended up taking 18 mg of Silenor for 1st time (just got samples); 8 mg of Rozerem (did not work either)_ 2 doses of Benadryl (more than 4 hours apart)_ Ibuprofen_ 9 mg of Melatonin and 1 mg of Klonopin_ and still no sleeop!

68, 3, Insomnia,weight gain,I tried taking the 3 mg. compounded version_ as my insurance wouldn't pay for the Silenor because it's so expensive.  The 3 mg. didn't help.  So_ I tried emptying out part of a 10 mg. capsule to approximate around 6 mg._ which helped but still didn't get me 7-8 hrs. of sleep per night.  For the past two or three months I've been taking the 10 mg. per night_ which at first made me groggy upon waking_ but now just allows me to stay asleep all night or if I do wake up_ I'm able to go back to sleep right away and I feel great the next morning.  However_ I've gained 10-15 lbs. in this period of time_ without changing my eating habits.  I don't really feel hungrier than I did before_ nor do I feel that I consume more than I did.  However_ the weight gain is piling on and I can't keep it up.  So_ I'm going to try to reduce the dosage to 6 mg. and then 3 mg. to see if I can get some sleep and lose some weight.  The weight gain and mild constipation are the only side effects I've had but the weight gain is enough for me to try to get off of it.,F,56,5  months10 mg. 1X D,1/4/2012,Doxepin hydrochloride

I felt extremely sluggish the next day up until about noon then it gradually wore off.  Also had strong heart palpitations which made me feel that I was having a stroke because my arms and legs felt very heavy in the morning and it was hard for me to get around.  What kind of doctor would even consider putting their patient on this medication?  Obviously my doctor did not know me well enough- after spending over an hour explaining just how sensitive that I am in taking medicine.  I have reactions to medications that most people do not but one thing I do know is that Doxepin is definitely not for me and I will not take it ever again!!,If you want to feel miserable and have cravings for sweet things all the time and have dry mouth so bad that your tongue literally sticks to the roof of your mouth and the next morning you wake up feeling very sluggish and really do not come out of this fog until about noon.

75, 3, Depression_ Sleep_ Weight Gain,It caused sleepiness_ but more than 50 mg. daily caused an asthma attack.  I'm assuming that this is due to the antihistamine in it.  It also caused Cervical Dystonia (a neurological condition of the neck) as well as impeded urine flow.  Additionally_ it made me groggy the next day and sometimes weak.,I did gain some weight (which I desperately needed to) from this drug and it did help me sleep.

77, 1, Insomnia,This drug is toxic.,This is not good medicine for itching (similarly to atarax)! Itching can be due to liver damage: doxepin is antidepressant and it makes liver damage worse.

It's a bit like having a migraine without the pain after several days off the drug.  Extreme irritability can also be an issue when abruptly discontinuing the drug.  Biggest issue is that even the lowest dose leaves me groggy and I can only take it when I have a regular sleep schedule.,Effective drug but should only be taken if the side effects can be tolerated and for those who have a stable schedule.,F,40,2  years5 mg 1X D,9/2/2011Email,Doxepin hydrochloride

EVEN when I did not need to. Some other side effects- Stiff all the time_ feeling of heaviness in the mid-section_ groggy atleast until after lunch time.  I did sleep much better at night but it was such a heavy sleep that my body was very sore the next day.I was supposed to get up to 200 mg daily_ but couldn't stand the side effects of it anymore.

My dreams are very intense and I remember them fully all day. I crave sugar like a mad woman and have gained a few pounds which I'm sure the lack of exercise has aided in.,I had chronic hives for several months until one week they flared up so badly I couldn't leave the house. Itching_ swelling of my face_ hands and feet_ the worst. Steroids did not help_ they only made it worse. Benadryl and cold baths appeared to be the only semi relief I could get. Finally went to a dermo and he gave me doxepin_ singulair and allegra. Hives went down but not for about a week and a half_ and_ I think_ because I went to an accupuncturist who did the most help. He told me I needed to keep my body temp low_ and part of that was to eliminate sugar_ booze_ and spicy food or exotic spices. My hives are almost gone or I can deal with the small breakouts_ and the breakouts only occur when I eat sugar or drink. The doc finally determined that I have exema and an auto immune difficiency brought upon by too much caffeine and toxins in my body. I now still take doxepin at night and have begun UVB light treatments which should allow me to only take allegra every day and go off the doxepin.

100, 1, Sleep,Even though I slept I did not like the drugged feeling so I tapered off over another month,This drug causes a withdrawal from hell. I have been off a careful taper for 5 months and I can't work and feel insane. Walk and pace all day_ extreme anxiety never had before_ shaking_ jittering_ worse insomnia than before taking.I am also having sever_ near seizure like jerks. Can't eat_ sweating and worst of all I feel insane_ just plain crazy. Only thing wrong before Doxepin was I was working shift work at a hospital and had insomnia.Now I have lost my job and my sanity. This is one bad drug when you have to stop....and I had no side effects while on it.,M,42,4  months10 1X D,9/16/2010Email,Doxepin hydrochloride
101, 4, Depression,weight gain_ memory problems_ confusion_ some vision problems_ vivid dreams,I tried other anti-depressants_ including Lexapro and couldn't tolerate them.I started at 25 mg. of Doxepin and wound up taking 300 mg. within 6 months.I felt great for a while at 150 mg. There was no weight gain at that point.Then I felt myself going in a cycle. One day depressed_ the other day fine.So I began increasing the doses_ 25 mg. per week.The cycles continued until I started taking 300 Mg. per day.At that point_ the depression stopped.Within 3 months_ I gained 45 lbs!I work out regularily_ doing 4 miles on the treadmill 5 times per week along with other activities.Even with all of that_ I haven't lost an ounce!I had 20/20 vision and now I need reading glasses and sometimes my long range vision is blurred.Also_ had a photographic memory and now my memory is about average or slighly below average.I also get confused the odd time_  such as opening the wrong drawer to get something.I really dislike the vivid dreams.They tend not to be pleasant dreams either.However_ remembering what my depression was like and the problems that I had with other medications such as Prozac_ Effexor_ Paxil_ Serzone and Lexapro_ (Cipralex)_ I am sticking with Doxepin.The worst side-effect that I had with some other meds_ (especially Paxil and Lexapro) was severe headaches.  And I mean severe.Some other anti-depressants that I tried made the depression worse.Bottom line: Taking Doxepin sure beats having depression.,M,56,4  years50 MG. 6X D,8/16/2010Email,Doxepin hydrochloride

107, 5, ,In the beginning_ I did have dry mouth,It was a miracle drug for me.  I had strong first-time bout of depression and could not sleep.  My Dr. used Doxepin 10 MG with ambien for the sleeping issue along with paxil.  The Dr. knew how I hated the idea of being dependent on any drug_ so once I was able to sleep again_ we worked ahead with the aim that I would first reduce ambien to zero and then reduce the amout of doxepin.  While I have never been able to go off paxil_ I was successful in reducing the doxepin to lower and lower amount 2MG-1MG or less and only when needed (once or twice per month)  My own theory on doxepin is that most people do not realize that while you will use higher amount initially_ within a few months_ you can (and probably need to)back off dosage amount.  And over time_ if you are consistent_ the amount you need will be incredible small. If I were to take 10MG pill now_ I would probably sleep for two days!,M,55,10  years5mg 1X O,4/7/2010,Doxepin hydrochloride

Sleep aids take about 7 hours to work on me. By then it is time to get up!,Great for my dogs' itching/allergies. They were driving me crazy with their scratching. Since it is a combo of histamine 1 and 2 antagonizers_ it is a dream come true. The vet never heard of it_ so I go to a regular doctor to get a script for the dogs. It also works wonderfully when I need it_ which is not often at this point in time. After doing significant research_ I discovered that my itching and photo-sensitivity were due to a bladder problem: chronic interstitial cystitis.

It has helped with the depression but after reading all the posts (and the info that came with the med)_ I am discouraged about taking it - maybe a higher dose would benefit me (only taking 50 mg at night).

I was craving foods I don't normally eat. I am normally a healthy eater and keep my bad food cravings in check but on this medication I wanted to eat ice cream_ chocolate_ fries_ etc. every day. When I would give into the cravings I never felt satisfied and would want to keep eating more and more. All I could think about was food. I workout regularly so the weight gain was really frustrating. I also would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted and had really vivid and intense dreams every night.

Also:  sun sensitivity (a known side effect)_ and weight gain/edema (although I don't know for sure which of my meds or eating habits lead to this)_ and muscle cramps (which I have not confirmed to be due to the doxepin).,I was taking 2400 mg of gabapentin (generic for Neurontin)_ along with low dose hormone pills and 150mg of doxepin.  I decreased the doxepin to 100mg with no noticable physical/mental changes.  Then_ because I was getting daily_ serious muscle cramps_ and because the gabapentin is non-negotiable_ I stopped taking the hormone pills and slowly reduced the doxepin to where I am now:  25mg.  The muscle cramps have lessened but not gone away.  Perhaps not a cause and effect_ and I am having my electrolytes tested because vitamin D deficiency (which I_ and most chronic pain people have) messes with calcium levels (and calcium is part of the delicate equation_ along with sodium_ potassium and magnesium_ for proper muscle function). I took 10mg of amytriptyline for two years before being switched to doxepin_ and had no problems with it - but it was a low dose.,F,43,4  months,8/26/2009,Doxepin hydrochloride

I found a great allergist/Immunologist who started me at 25mg doxepin and gradually increased it to 150mg a day.  He did this over a 1-1/2 week period. This drug has cleared up most of my hives.  I still get a few here and there_ but I can live with those.  The hives are far and few between.  My doctor also told me doxepin had to be in you system (about 3 weeks) to really start feeling the effects_ (he also said doxepin only works in about 50% of the people who try it for hives).  I noticed some of the comments of people taking 50mg to 75mg and getting no results. Talk with you doctor and see if he/she can bump you to 150mg. Also I have not had any weight gain.  I also noticed in the comments that people were taking both doxepin and prednisone.  Prednisone is the worst for weight gain and its really bad for you.,F,53,60  days,12/1/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
150, 4, Cripp Anxiety_ MJ Depress_ Fatigue,I have been disabled by illness for two + years! I was getting disenchanted with meds and did some research on my own and picked this one based on MANY issues. I have been pleased so far. I do have the slow-morning issue_ but it is my 1st job in many years so I am not pushing myself. Also I was very hungry the first few weeks of this medication_ and experienced some sleep related issues such as Sleep Dialing_ Sleep Eating_ Sleep Internet Related Issues. It lasted about 6 weeks. I notified my friends and therapist about this_ and learned to take the meds every night at the exact same time and to not do anything tech or food related shortly before or during dosing. ,I take this medication with Topomax_ and I think this is why I have not had weight related issues. As for dry mouth I had a very negative issue with MAOI's years ago_ EXPENSIVE_ so I am chewing sugarless gum on a regular basis with this med. The gum also helps with weight and IBS issues... sorbitol!I think it also important to note that I take fish oil_ vit D_ a vit B complex_ and these really also assist me with managing my illness and fatigue.I am 5'3 and weigh about 125My dentist gave me the two thumbs up!,F,40,3  months,11/30/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride

152, 1, chronic hives,dizziness_ weight gain_ bloating_ blurry vision_ occasional coordination problems - dropping things.,Did not notice improvement on hives even with steadily increasing doses up to 75 mg. Prednisone helped immediately.  I am weaning myself off doxepin and finding a physician with more honesty.  Would prefer if physician had warned of weight gain - 20 pounds in a 2 weeks - normally active_ work out_ but no energy while on doxepin.,F,59,3  weeks,11/12/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride

154, 4, Anxiety - sleep related issues,Very few once I learned a secret.  I started out with the full amount of Doxepin my Dr. suggested.  It worked well_ but in time I felt sluggish.  I cut back (over time) and found that I had the same success at much lower dosage - 1/4 of dosage.  I believe that my body adjusted to it and made me more receptive to it.  In backing off of dosage_ I found a perfect level.  I can't tell you what a blessing (for 12 years) doxepin has been.,With regards to weight loss_ again - adjusting dosage was a big help here. Talk to your doctor about looking at cutting back amount after first 3 months.  It was amazing to me how little I needed to get that same effect related to good sleep!,M,53, ,11/2/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride

157, 4, Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria,Vivid and bizarre dreams the first 2 weeks.  Some dry mouth.  Excessive weight gain.,Doxepin did seem to do a pretty good job of allowing me to decrease my Predinisone following my most recent bout of CIU.  However_ I am completely miserable following a 25lb weight gain in less than 3 months.  I can't walk up stairs or even the length of a couple blocks without becoming exhausted.I'm going to taper off the Doxepin and increase my other antihistamines and save the Doxepin for bad flare-ups.,M,46,3  months,8/18/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
158, 4, Anxiety,I started taking Doxepin after I landed myself in the ER from  my first panic attack. I knew I had some anxiety issues_ but I thought that it was apart of life. Well_ my life has been better. I can think clearer and my anxiety is alot better. But_ I too_ have gained more weight than I care to have. I went to my Dr to see about something else and he told me to exercise and be more  active. Well_ that was a couple months ago and the scale has went no where but up and all of my jeans are skin tight. I love the way feel mentally_ but I can't stand the added weight.,,F,26,6  months,7/20/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
159, 5, Sinequan Doxepin,I was really tired the first morning after taking and did have a few panic attacks the first two weeks but after that I have been great. I've been suffering with extreme panic for 12 years. I was put on almost every anti depressant nerve pill out there and nothing worked. Doxepin has saved my nerves_ i'm three weeks in and my panic has gone from two times a day everyday to only once a week if even that. I was 88lbs when I started it and now I actually have an appetite and can enjoy eating. I only take about 3mg of the medication though rather than a big amount.,It is a life saver for anyone experiencing severe panic_ I can't believe I tortured my body this long without taking it. You have to tell the doctor to prescribe it to you though because its an older medicine and they like to hand out the new ones.,F,22,3  weeks,7/14/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
160, 4, for severe hives,I took 20mg for one month along with zrytec_ zantac and predinsone.  I gained 20 pounds in three weeks.

161, 5, chonic daily migraine,dry mouth_ some constipation.,i am mentally prepared for the weight gain everyone talks about.  a fair trade not to wake up_ every day for the last eight weeks and almost every day for the last year and a half_ with a severe_ unbeatable headache. that is true_ almost indescribable torture and makes life barely worth living.  this drug gives me a glimmer of hope (though i've been disappointed many times before).  Just sleeping better alone makes me feel like i've returned to life.  hoping committed exercise will offset weight gain.  but as long as it keeps working_ i don't really care.,F,39,5  days,6/17/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
162, 5, Chronic Hives,Vivid_ bizarre dreams and weight gain.  I now watch what I eat and am generally healthier for it - not a bad trade off.  As for the dreams_ I find them entertaining.,As some others have stated_ forget antihistamines_ just use the Doxepin.  I use 75mg per night.  I suffered 5 years before discovering this great drug.  Prednisone works great_ but the side effects have more risk.  I'll still take 5 - 10mg of Pred. on really bad days.  It's a quality of life decision for me.  But I incorporated glucosamine and calcium w/ magnesium as a supplement to my diet.  It's been so worth it_ I strongly urge others to try it.,M,55,1  years,6/13/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
163, 5, CHRONIC HIVES !!,Tired_ dry mouth and groggy the first week then not so bad the following weeks..,I've tried everything ever made to get rid of hives! Nothing has ever worked at all besides Prednisone which will destroy your body and mind in no time at all - so that drug is out of the question long term. But DOXEPIN has been a wonder drug for me :) It has cleared up all my hives after only a couple weeks of use and a higher dosage!! For everyone who has not had success with Doxepin I had realized at my initial dose of 75 mg's per day only gave me minimal relief. It was only after uping my dose to a steady 150 mg's per day that I was 100% hive free :),M,35,2  months,6/10/2008Email,Doxepin hydrochloride
164, 3, chronic hives,weight gain_ but could be other factors_ metal taste in my mouth.,I have read a couple of comments from people who've had varying results with different manufacturers.  I was taking 75mg doxepin (plus a lot of other stuff) from a manufacturer that I'm not sure of - worked great hives under control for the first time in over a year.  I got the prescription refilled and immediately my hives were back - i talked to the pharmacist and she said they did order from a different manufacturer.  We are military overseas so I don't have a lot of pharmacy options - does anybody know why different manufacturers makes a difference?,F,37,7  months,6/7/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
165, 5, Itching -24/7  for 8 months,Doxepin (35mg)a day_ has had no (zero) side effects for me.  I am so grateful,I had itching all over my body for 8 months. Diagnosed initially with dermatitis ( no rash - just itching.) Then saw an allergist and found I was allergic to all but about 13 foods. Had what the neurologist thinks was an anaphylactic attack and mini stroke. Was sent to a new allergist_ who_ after many tests prescribed doxepin. I was never depressed. There were no side effects except it stopped the itching entirely....YEAH! Sometimes I have a feeling of sharp pin pricks but that is nothing. The first allergist had given me Singulair_ Allegra_ (Xypra - gave me a rash)  but they had no effect on the itching.,F,69,30  days,6/6/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
166, 2, insomnia_ neuropathy (due to Lupus),Weight gain - 20 pounds in six months.  Daytime sleepiness.,Doxepin did not help the insomnia at all.  I am going to taper off of it.  I tried to quit cold turkey and experienced horrible withdrawal.  Not sure if it helped with the neuropathy; the symptoms did abate but other factors may have played a part.,F,45,9  months,6/2/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
167, 3, Severe itching,Massive weight gain_ increased appetite_ constant food cravings_ lethargy_ apathy_ & difficulty getting going in the morning.,This medicine worked beautifully to stop severe_ intense chronic itching.  It allowed me to sleep peacefully instead of itching miserably for the first time in more than a year.Unfortunately_ it also turned me from a person who's always been normal weight into a female version of Homer Simpson.  I had to stop taking it because I gained 30 pounds in 6 months (15 pounds in the first month alone!) despite increased activity and attempts at reducing food consumption. That was a huge struggle_ as the doxepin made me crave food constantly and reduced my willpower to almost nil.  I also had to take up drinking energy drinks to get me going in the morning_ and had trouble making it to work on time.After I quit taking it I stopped gaining weight_ but it's been impossible for me to lose it. I'm afraid that it's somehow reset my body at a higher weight.  I'm starting Wellbutrin in the hope that it will help me to reset my weight back to normal.,F,38,6  months,5/31/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride

I have noticed a difference in the efrfectiveness depending on the manufacturer of the pill.  The only side effects I'm aware of are dry mouth_ groggy when I wake up.  Also a battle against weight gain has been ongoing_ but not sure if the Doxepin is a contributor.  I've tried to go off the medication before (30 days) but met with disastrous results in that I could never achieve any semblance of normal sleep patterns.,,M,60,20  years,3/17/2008,Doxepin hydrochloride
170, 5, Hives,None,Taking 50mg every night.  Had haves for 6 months and Doxepin was the only med that worked after taking Zyrtec_ Avelox_ Nicomide_ and Prednisone.

Switched to 10mg capsules made by Mylan along with Elidel cream and it cleared up in 2 days.,F,38,5  days,2/28/2008Email,Doxepin hydrochloride
171, 4, Mast Cell Disorder,Sedation that improved with time_ some weight gain_ breast tenderness/swelling,I take up to 80mg during waking hours. I have autoimmune hives that are manifesting very unusually-I cannot eat or drink without having hives in mouth_ on tongue and presumably throughout digestive tract_ since I also get nausea and stomach/intestinal cramping_ also heart racing_ plus dermographism on outer skin. Hives are caused by food contacting mouth/tongue NOT by an actual allergy to the food. Prednisone and massive amounts of Benadryl were the only drugs that seemed to help before Doxepin was prescribed 2 years after onset of symptoms. Lots of ER trips. Weight gain is actually good_ since I dropped so much from not being able to eat. Symptoms aren't completely under control yet. I can't each too much or outside of a certain time frame-two hours after taking pill...not before and then I get a 2 hour safe window_ unless I eat too much...have been unable to find anyone else with these symptoms_ my immunologist has not seen it before and he's in a major metro area.,F,40,6  weeks,2/11/2008Email,Doxepin hydrochloride

Nothing seemd to work long term_ so I stopped everything but the Doxepin because it helps me sleep at night and low and be hold I have not had a serious bought with hives for about 9 months now.

Those symptoms went away after about a month or so. It helps with my anxiety_ and I don't really have depression. Even if it didn't help I would keep taking it because it helps dry up my nervous stomach. Before_ I would have diarrhea almost every day. I started taking this and I NEVER have it. Whatever I had before (irritable bowel syndrome?) it is cured now. If you have this problem ask your doctor about this. I did have weight gain_ but i'd rather be fat then not being able to leave my house!  ,I would not reccomend taking more than 25 MG.,M,27,10  years,9/22/2007,Doxepin hydrochloride

Parr and Mylan do nothing for me at all.  It is amazing that different versions of a generic could have such different effects.  Recently the bottles from Watson have looked different; the capsules have lighter markings_ and I am noticing a lack of effectiveness.

186, 4, Hives (Itchy and red),Weight gain and oversleeping,I have been on Doxepin for almost 3 weeks.  Before that I had been back and forth to the doctor and emergency room for what seemed like a severe allergy attack.  I had been breaking out with itchy red bumps for nearly 2 months then all of a sudden it started affecting my breathing and the redness was swelling.  They admitted me to the hospital and from that point the steriod shots began.  After I was released I was to take steroid packs for 2 wks.  It helped reduce the itching but the redness kept coming back with no clue as to why and I was gaining weight.  I took everything from benedryl to allergra nothing helped.  When I went to the allergist he put me on Doxepin...wonderful!  It stopped the itching and the redness completely but was causing more weight gain. So now I am taking a fat reducer called xenical to help with the weight gain...but thats an entirely different story.,F,34,19  days,4/20/2007,Doxepin hydrochloride

However - I slept like a champ although only for 5 hour stretches but that's pretty much all one needs as one gets older_ yes?,25mg dosage perscribed by my physician at the VA Hospital. Took the meds one day and am still feeling the effects!  Finally 'sobering' up if you will.  Difficult getting up at my usual time and can't seem to stop eating.  Can't afford to get fat as I am still in the military (Nat'l Guard)and must pass p-t test and weight asides. A bit tentative about taking it again - (didn't take it last evening and slept like a freakin' baby for 5 hours) as I am still groggy and sluggish.  After the first night of meds driving to work I could not focus on the trek in and nearly had an accident.  Never had more horns blarring at me. My next VA appointment is in two weeks so will discuss other options then.  In the meantime I will stick to an every-other-night regime until this medication and I can come to an agreement.,F,45,1  days,4/12/2007,Doxepin hydrochloride

I also am feeling very dizzy in the AM with some blurry vision. Since I also take other drugs_ it's sometimes hard to know what is causing the side effect_ but this one was pretty clear.,It did take away the nausea that I get when my irritable bowel is acting up (associated with fibromyalga) and also seemed to take away some of my leg pain. I intend to get off this drug and resume the Elavil that I was previously taking.

Finally I'm down to only the Doxepin_ and NO HIVES for 3 weeks!,F,55,4  months,1/17/2007,Doxepin hydrochloride
201, 5, hives,Chronic urticaria on and off for 20 years.  They could not determine the cause.  Doxepin was the drug that finally stopped them completely.  IF YOU HAVE HIVES AND THEY CAN'T STOP THEM_ THIS IS THE BEST DRUG THERE IS!!  My twin brother started developing hives too and told his Doctor about Doxepin.  It stopped his too.  It may be classified as an antidepressant but the  extremely high antihistamine effects of this drug will stop chronic urticaria once and for all.  I take it nightly to prevent any further recurrences.  It is also an EXCELLENT sleep aid too.  100 mg.,IF YOU HAVE HIVES - THIS IS THE BEST MEDICINE FOR IT - PERIOD!,M,50,14  years,1/3/2007,Doxepin hydrochloride

204, 4, extreme itching,none other than possible weight gain & bloating which did not necessarily attribute to this medication (still on prednisone_ zyrtec & cellcept) however_ after reading reviews this could possibly be the culprit.,take 50 mg. morning & evening more if necessary. noticed immediate relief.,,58,2  months,10/22/2006Email,Doxepin hydrochloride

Possible rash or joint pain_ don't know(?),Doxepin Elixir ~ 15 -20 mg/day has been a good medicine for me.It helps control my burning skin from a mast cell disorder.A few minor side effects_ but not too bad I don't think_ as ofAug. 2006.,M,43,2  years,8/13/2006Email,Doxepin hydrochloride

207, 5, chronic hives and angioedema,mild sleepinessmild decreased libidomild weight gain,Although it does have the potential for some irritating side effects_ I have found doxepin to be the ideal maintanence drug for suppressing hives and the side effects are minimal compared to prednisone.  Just because it happens to be an antidepressant doesn't imply that a patient taking it is being treated for depression.  The doses (10 -60mg) taken for hives generally tend to be much less than doses for depression and anxiety.,F,28,1.5  years,6/19/2006,Doxepin hydrochloride
208, 4, Idiopathic Urticaria,drowsey; lathargic,suggest you add doseage to the feedback as it would be helpful for comparison purposes.  in my case was up to as much as 60MG per day; but have tapered down to 10MG per day_ still with good results thus far(knock on wood).  For info in my case had to use corti-steroids to get the angio-edema & hives under control with Doxepin used concurrently; continuing with Doxepin as corti-steroids were tapered off.,M,56,7  months,5/15/2006,Doxepin hydrochloride
209, 5, insomnia,none,I take 150mg about thirty minutes before I want to sleep. I am asleep in thirty minutes. The next day I am well rested with no drug hangover. I have never experienced any adverse side effects.,M,62,10  years,2/20/2006Email,Doxepin hydrochloride
210, 3, sleep disorder and anxiety,Doxepin worked great for about 3 weeks. I was so happy that it seemed I finally found the correct medication! I suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and was unable to sleep.  Doxepin made me so relaxed and I was able to obtain a wonderful deep sleep_ waking up early_ very refreshed.  But now_ after about 5 weeks_ it doesn't seem to be relaxing me as it did in the beginning and I even have increased it. Now_ I am so bloated in my stomach and abodomen that I can't stand it.  I'm getting so discouraged because I was on Seroguel before the doxepin and that worked wonders also .. then the bloating and weight problem hit.  Guess this one is going to be flushed down the toilet too.  It's helped tremendously with my anxiety .. there just has to be something out there that will do the same thing without the bloating and weight gain.  I'm getting pretty discouraged because just when I find something that works_ I blow up like a blow-fish and that sure doesn't help the depression and anxi,,F,56,5  weeks,12/5/2005Email,Doxepin hydrochloride
211, 5, chronic hives,tired_ but I have a 1 year old_ so she is probably more to blame!,Thank God for this medication. My hives were so bad that I had severe swelling and had to to carry around an epi-pen. This medication works wonderfully. If you have chronic hives_ you owe it to yourself to try it. I feel giddy just looking at my skin and not seeing angry red welts all over me making my life miserable. It started working pretty quickly too.,F,32,1  days,8/25/2005,Doxepin hydrochloride
212, 5, Fibromyalgia/sleep disorder,Having been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 15 years ago_ the doctor prescribed a very low dose of Doxepin for the sleep disorder that is prevalent in Fibro patients_ like me.  I take 20mgs. at bedtime and sleep just fine.  If I forget to take it even one night_ I toss and turn all night. It's been a lifesaver for me!,no side effects on such a low dose.,F,56,15  years,6/28/2005,Doxepin hydrochloride

Just could not stay awake.,I hope it's just me that reacted this way with it.,M,45,1  weeks,4/12/2005,Doxepin hydrochloride
216, 2, sleep,Well_ I started the drug summer 2003.  I specifically needed a non-narcotic drug to help me with sleep and so I tri-tated off the crazy drugs (which I believe should be taken OFF the market due to its addictive & dangerous nature) ambien_ then sonata.   and I weighed 130 and I am now 150 lbs.  I eat healthy & am active.  I finally put it together.  I also take Effexor_ which has changed my life for the better_ and topamax_ which I take for migraines.  If I had known what Dox wa going to do to my body_ no way would I have agreed to take it!!  Not that Im vain but I am 5'3 and it made my breasts from a C to a D cup--and 20 pounds!  Its a lot on a small frame woman.  I feel like a freak.  My face also has edema_ which is swelling...  I want OFF this drug.  How will I sleep??I do not know but if I can get sober_ I surely can r-program this issue as well.,,F,38,2  years,4/5/2005,Doxepin hydrochloride

The quality of life was less than satisfying before starting the drug.  However_ the weight gain is begining to depress me (funny_ since this is also an antidepressant)  Therefore_ I am weaning off.  Hopefully sleep will not be an issue.,F,37,6  months,3/25/2005,Doxepin hydrochloride

223, 3, dermatitis of scalp,I have been using doxepin for about 2 months and at first it did not do anything for my chronic scalp dermatitis. I do not know where this came from since I know of no one in my family who has had this. It is chronic and has been with me for a year and one half and I hate it!!!!! I would rather have the rosacea that came out of no where in my 40's. This visited me in my 50's and won't go away. It has just started to work for the scalp (finally) but I feel like crap.,Feeling lethargic_ like my limbs have to be carried by someone else_ tired_ irritable_ angry (this could be situational)_ fluelike symptoms_ and feeling like I have hangover the next day after taking at night.
