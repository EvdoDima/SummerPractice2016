1, 5, ADD,Without Focalin_ I probably wouldn't be passing any of my classes. I'be been taking the medication for about 6 years now. I've tested days without it and it absolutely screws up my day. I don't do any work in school and then come home and have issues focusing on homework. My doctor has prescribed me many different medications between Kindergarten and 3rd grade. Focal in was the only thing that worked.,,M,15,6  years10,2/29/2016,Focalin
2, 3, ADD,Very effective as far as attentivness and alertness and lasts pretty much the whole day.It has also helped with my memory and processing information more in depth with less impulsive decision making on tests homework etc. Side effects- makes me shaky and weak. Doesn't really address restlessness in class but it is still manageable most of the time. A noticeable increase in anxiety and elevated heart rate especially with small amounts of activity even just walking to class.,Still have issues putting thoughts into words.Loss of appetite but not particularly concerning having started the medication so recently. I also feel much more social and engaged in conversation.I haven't experienced any mood swings and actually keeps me pretty positive/motivated.Being the first medication I've tried it is definitely an improvement apposed to nothing but it comes with the trade offs. My doctor is concerned about the anxiety and increased heart rate so i am going to explore some other options within the coming weeks.,M,19,7  days40mg,10/21/2015,Focalin
3, 1, ADHD,First headaches_ tic (humming non stop)_ he is an emotional roller coaster ride and is exhibiting bipolar and depression behaviors. The outburst are so intense.,Tics_ he is humming non stop_ I am tapering him off now. He has been on Stratara for well over a year but he still has no motivation nor could he consintrate so we switched it up. Since starting this medication he is not acting like the son I have always known. He will cry for hours_ say he is worthless basically and that his life is horrible and no one understands. Many of the concerns before my comment this hit home. WORST Meds EVER! My poor son is being pulled in so many emotional directions I'm so mad that this crud was approved by the FDA.,M,8,10  days10mg,10/10/2015,Focalin
4, 3, ADD/ADHD,Finger tingling/numbness (circulation problems),This medication worked well for my ADHD but I was taken off of it within a few days due to the potentially harmful side effects.,F,29,3  days5mg 1X D,5/23/2014,Focalin

6, 1, ADHD,Instability. Unpredictable mood swings and occasionally even panic attacks.,Initially_ Focalin_ broken into 5mg doses worked okay when I couldn't get an Adderall prescription filled_ but after about a month- Every time I took it I would get hyperanxiety. Once to the point of auditory hallucinations. I tried one last time earlier today and had a panic attack. Would not recommend this drug to anyone as it has way too unstable a range of effects_ both psychologically and physically. I'll be looking into a different medication option_ and for reference_ I did not experience theses negative effects from adderall.,M,24,2  months10mg 2X D,7/14/2012,Focalin
7, 2, ADHD,Makes my daughter very irritable_ crabby and emotional.  Mood swings and many meltdowns.  It also makes her very anxious.  Spitting because she thinks bugs are in her mouth_ worried about germs etc.  It also killed her appetite and she won't drink much either.,It seemed to help the first week or so (minus the spitting) but not longer has much effect.  I don't want to increase the dose for rear that it will make her mood and OCD behaviors worse.,F,5,3  weeks5 mg 1X D,5/13/2012Email,Focalin

9, 5, ADULT ADD,Since I began taking this drug_ as an adult _ I always noticed some sort of anxiety_ which is what I described it as... I have always constantly kept a blank writing pad next ti me_ because as the effect of the medication began_ my mind would began to think about all these other things (in my 'to do list') that I had forgotten..._ so  I would start a to do list as I am trying to study. I never thought this was a negative effect until now_ where I believe I am becoming dependent on the focalin. I read how children pick their nails... I do that___ I cant sit still_ yet again_ I can focus. Its a very scary feeling_ and I find myself 'self prescribing' higher and higher doses_ solely to be able to focus_ yet again_ i think I am becoming even more an anxiety driven.... Im not sure what to do at this point. My education (higher education) depends on me being able to concentrate on classes and this is truly becoming a problem....,,F,27,18  months20 3X D,10/31/2011Email,Focalin
10, 5, ADHD,Initially made me sleepy_ then slightly upbeat. This drug is a miracle! I waited many many years to finally try medication because of all the negative things I heard about stimulants. I regret it now because once I tried this I was able to concentrate_ focus on one thing at a time_ actually start and finish a book_ clean off my cluttered desk_ and complete projects at work. My boss thinks I'm a new person and so does my husband. Take my advice and tell those who tell you this is poison to keep their mistaken opinions to themselves because focalin has changed my life for the better.,It works well with little or no side effects. I did lose 15 pounds but that was because I had more energy and joined a gym.,F,48,365  days2.5mg 2X D,5/18/2011,Focalin
11, 1, It was dispensed in error!!,loss of hair_ manic episodes_ up three days at time_ extreme depression_ agitation_ blurred vision_ fast weight loss_ fear_ paranoia,My pharmacy was supposed to refill my adderall xr 30 but instead gave me' focalin xr 30 (but bottle said adderall xr 30) .. This was the most horrifying drug I have ever been on. I felt like I had lost my mind and was depressed to a dangerous point. The error was found and I was finally notified but the damage was done.,F,32,8  days30 mg xr 1X D,5/5/2011Email,Focalin
12, 2, AD/HD,My son exhibits OCD-like behavior_ nail biting_ hyper-focused on finger or toes... sometimes to the point of distracting him worse than if he's not medicated. Loss of appetite is minimal. REBOUND as med wears off can be severe: hyperactivity worse than normal_ aggressive_ defiant. My son metabolizes this medication in 2-4 hours tops. By the way the rebound is much worse if your dose is too low_ but I'm afraid to bump him up because he's already OCD over his fingers enough as it is.,I had him on Focalin XR prior to trying the immediate release. I'm happier with the way the XR worked. It had less of a rebound_ less OCD/Hyper-focus response and lasted up to 6 hours. He seemed less zombie-like and more outgoing as well. It did interfere with his sleep more and definitely impacted his appetite and cause him to not gain weight.,M,6,6  months10mg 1X D,3/1/2011Email,Focalin
13, 4, ADD,Mild depression when it wears off_ very mild fatigue when it wears off_ thirst.  I was totally unexpectedly able to stop a 30 year finger-picking habit!,I take an odd combo of 10MG once each morning of Ritalin LA (long acting) and 5 MG of Focalin (Dexmethylph generic actually) 2x per day.  For me_ Focalin is better for focus and Ritalin is better for energy and willpower.  With Focalin alone I am very focused -- and often decide I don't feel like using it.  With Ritalin alone I feel great -- and end up working in scattered fashion on a bunch of stuff that does not really matter.  The combo is best.  I used to just take the 5MG Ritalin/Methylin 4-hour tabs twice daily.  These resulted in a nasty 30 minute angry/irritated state about 6 hours after ingestation as they wore off.  After kicking my wife's cat once too often for me to be able to live with myself (and fearing I'd do something worse) I switched to Focalin -- which does not give me nearly as much angry irritation when it wears off.,M,41,1  years5 MG 2X D,11/17/2010,Focalin
14, 1, Adult AD/HD,Depression and Anxiety.  Shaking_ insomnia_ headaches.  Drained by the end of the day.  Mind racing.,This drug helped initialy_ although I didn't like the way it made me feel physically.  I kept taking it because it did help me focus and pay attention.  Then I fell into an almost crippling depression and couldn't understand why.  I have never been depressed_ but now I've had such a lovely life experience.  Then I began feeling panicky and out of control.  I've never had anxiety before either.  Thanks Focalin!  I talked to my doctor about it_ who prescribed Lexapro.  Thanks pharmaceutical companies!  I think I'll just detox from the Focalin and look for other ways to increase focusÂ…,F,28,60  days20 MG 1X D,5/24/2010,Focalin
15, 3, ADHD,Son was very emotional on this.  Started showing OCD behaviors_ such as fingernail picking and toenail picking and picking between toes_ everyday it got progressively worse.  Extreme fear of insects started with this too.  Stopped it 3 days ago and so far the OCD symptoms have stopped as well.,Focalin was the 2nd med we tried for my 5 year old son after Adderall_ which made him very irritable.  Less irritability on Focalin and much more affection from him_ but there were very clear side effects from this. The OCD behavior such as picking his fingernails and his toes were quite concerning.  This progressively got worse every day.  Even his teacher mentioned it to me.  The last day he was on it_ he was freaking out about a fly in our van.  He was compltely panicked over it_ screaming_ just like if I were to have 10 big spiders crawling on me_ that's how he was acting over this fly that was flying around in our van.  He has NEVER behaved that way about a bug before.  We stopped the Focalin that day and are starting the Daytrana patch today.  It's been 3 days and I haven't seen him picking his fingernails or toenails since stopping the Focalin. I believe this drug brings out OCD tendencies in people.  I've never seen anything like this in my son before and I haven't seen it in the 3 days since he stopped taking it.,M,5,1  months10 mg 1X D,3/30/2010Email,Focalin
16, 5, ADHD,slight loss of appetite,My son has tried every ADHD medicine available and this is by far the best. Focalin seems to control his impulses and increases his ability to stay focused and do well in school while still allowing his personality to come through. It has had the least affect on his appetite and sleep patterns.  All other medicines we tried since he was 5 include Adderall_ Ritalin_ Concerta_ Vyvanse and Stratterra.  They all showed signs of extreme irratability and agitation_ and affected his sleep and appettite. Adderal and Ritalin both caused nervous ticks and Strattera caused him to feel like he did not belong. Vyvanse caused him to act irrational emotionally.  Extreme mood swings. From a mom who continues to research and stay on top of what is available and how it effects my child this is definitely what I recommend to any parent.,M,16,4  years,1/9/2010Email,Focalin
17, 5, Adult ADHD_ some depression issues,Sleepy! Have to take a nap after dose. When I wake up_ I'm fine. When it wears off_ some depression/anger issues. Nothing nearly as bad as Wellbutrin.,Works so much better than the SNRIs. I'm just a little too becalmed - sleepy. I'm at 20 mg XR have only been at this dose couple of weeks. If the sleepiness/mood extremes smooth out_ I'll take it till the day I die. I have refractory depression and this cures without loss of libido or flat affect. Otherwise_ thumb's up!,F,48,70  days,7/5/2009,Focalin
18, 5, ADHD,Mild headache,This drug has been very effective for my son.  He was having severe attention problems at school which showed on his report card in his grades and his conduct scores.   Since taking this drug_ he has brought N's up to S's and some N's up to E's.  His teacher sees a remarkable improvement.  He still eats very well - almost better than before.  He complains of a headache occasionally but that could also be from his allergies.,M,7,3  months,5/6/2009,Focalin
19, 1, ADD,This is by far the WORST drug I have ever taken in my life. Everytime I took Focalin I had these HORRIBLE jitters and I couldn't stop yawning uncontrollably. I was also very thirsty and had to drink several glasses of water all day long. I had episodes where I would get very VERY angry and aggressive and felt like I could go on a shooting spree or kill myself. I could feel blood rushing through my body and and I would get so hot to the point where you could see my hands would be very red in color. I would also get very moody (as if I were bipolar) and anxious and have awful panic attacks. I was on a normal dose for my weight. This is a dangerous drug. Don't take it -- AVOID FOCALIN. It's HORRIBLE!,I will never take it again. It is a dangerous drug and should be banned.,M,22,1  months,3/13/2009Email,Focalin
20, 5, Bipolar NOS,Decreased appetite-- that's about it. I wish I could give this drug ten stars!!! Email me to learn more about it.,A MIRACLE DRUG.  Focalin saved my life because my doctor was willing to try something very unconventional for BP. It pulled me out of horrible bipolar mixed states and made me see that life really COULD be worth living again. If you have BP and your mood stabilizer is not enough_ see if your doctor will let you add on Focalin. The other stimulants do NOT work for this purpose.,F,39,2  years,11/4/2008Email,Focalin
21, 1, Adult ADD,Psychosis; Severe Depression; Uncontrollable crying spells; Feelings of being unworthy,Although many people have reacted very positively to this drug_ I ended up at a mental hospital 3 days after I started taking it. I've never had any serious problems and I mentioned to my doctor that I was forgetting everything lately so he prescribed this to me. Seriously_ it was a complete nightmare! It took about 2 days to recover_ but I am fine now. Be careful with anything you take/,F,28,3  days,6/11/2008,Focalin
