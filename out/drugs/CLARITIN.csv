0, 1, Sinus drainage,Wooziness_ dizziness_ numb feeling in hands and feet_ confusion_ blurred vision_ mental delay,This stuff is AWFUL! I have been recovering from mono_ strep_ and a sinus infection all at once so I wanted something to keep me from draining in my throat. It helped the drainage_ but made me feel like I was crazy. I debated going to the ER before I realized I've been taking the generic (loratadine) for the same amount of time as I've had symptoms. Claritin affects my sister very badly_ too.,F,19,10  days10 MG,8/12/2016,Claritin

2, 1, Seasonal allegies,Nausea_ vivid nightmares_night sweats_ hot flashes_ bloating_ loss of appetite_ change in taste_ paranoia_ intense depression_ anxiety_ rapid heart beat_ irritability_ moodiness_ headaches,I was convinced I was pregnant until I thought to put two and two together and realized all of these symptoms started when I started taking claritin. I got flutters of anxiety in my stomach over the weirdest things_ I felt legitimately terrified to go to sleep because of the nightmares_ I treated everyone around me like garbage like could've ruined my relationships. If you are bipolar or have any sort of mood disorder I would absolutely not recommend taking this cause it sends you on an evil war path for some reason. I couldn't figure out why I was being so mean to everyone but looking at other people's symptoms_ this makes perfect sense! I can't believe an allergy pill can turn a person into such a lunatic!,F,21,2  weeks10MG,6/28/2016,Claritin
3, 1, running nose_ itchy eyes_ sneezing,Day1 Hyperactive_ felt great.Day 2 Mild allergy-like symptoms returns.  Except eye irritation becomes worse than original symptom. Dry mouth_ sleepy. Day 3 Mild rash. Attribute rash to adhesive sensitivity as rash appears around minor skin wound site.  Day 4 Rash becomes raised and painful_ moves to parts of chest_ face and ears_ wound site looks angry_ skin becomes extremely sensitive to sunlight.  Discontinue Claritin. Day 5 rash and swelling go down in afternoon.  Expect rash to disappear in 24-48 hrs. Waiting for Dr appointment.,I mistook the reaction to Claritin for the allergic reactions I was using Claritin to treat. Starting Claritin caused inflammation_ soreness_ dry red itchy eyes.  Led to  inflammation and hives around wound site_ causing site to appear angry and infected. Stopping Claritin caused the inflammation and rash to subsided and wound site looks much better.  Taking Calritin caused far worse symptoms than the original hayfever symptoms and lengthened wound healing time.,F,40,4  days10 1X D,6/28/2016,Claritin

I began having migraines_ Scintillating scotoma they are called.  Couple this with anxiety_ weakness in my arms and legs_ I was a mess!

7, 1, Seasonal allergies,"I can understand the claim that claritin nearly destroyed a marriage. I usually take Allegra during my seasonal allergy episode. Heard great things about claritin and decided to give it a try. Began working after 3 days. After a week_ I noticed things began to smell and taste strange. Bacon and eggs were horrible_ I love bacon and eggs. Steak may as well have been rotten and baking in the sun on a hot road for a few days. I swear I could taste the dish soap used to clean dishes and told my wife to stop using that brand. I became certain she was washing_ but not rinsing the dishes properly and we went through all the dishes several times so I could be sure it wasn't the soap. The smell of food cooking became nearly stomach turning. The final straw was when a co worker and I went to make a repair on a new boat. The crew was cooking. I smelled bad grease_ and asked him what he smelled. He replied_ ""smells like Thanksgiving dinner."" I stopped taking claritin and went back to Allegra. It took almost a year to regain my sense of smell and taste. Took claritin for nearly a month. My suggestion_ if it works for you_ more power to you_ if you notice strange smells_ especially breakfast_ stop taking it right away! This is not a joke_ I don't care what the write up_ or contraindications (sp?) say. This actually happened to me. Hope this helps someone.",,M,44,1  months,5/23/2016Email,Claritin
8, 2, seasonal allergies,Extreme fatigue_ muscle aches_ occasional shakiness and feeling cold and loss of mental focus.  Sleep has been disrupted and I have been needing to take daily naps_ despite being highly physically fit and active.  Like other readers_ I chalked this up to a stressful time in my life and work schedule and perhaps going through having a minor bug or low adrenal functioning_ or the being in the early stages of peri-menopause.  I have felt more reactive than normal_ but again thought it was due to disrupted sleep alone at first or possible other issues_ as listed.  Stomach issues increased too_ and have had lower back pain for the first time in my life.  After reading more on the side effects_ I'm finding my cluster of symptoms resemble several other patients' self reports. I am stopping Claritin- not worth the side effects.,It does initially work well for stopping extremely bad allergies- I'm not usually bothered but the east coast this spring left me with breathing issues starting in April_ so I started Claritin to continue the outdoor sports and activities that I enjoy.  I do think some of the effect is cumulative and am hoping that this will start to work itself out of my system_ but expect it may take some time.  I won't take the chance again_ however_ with Claritin_ as I really think the side effects I'm experiencing are directly linked to this medication.  I recently had to change my primary care physician due to insurance changes_ and she did not take my change of energy that seriously_ but I don't think is aware of how drastic a difference this has been for me.  I will re alert the practice to the fact I due feel this is an issue specifically with Claritin.  I plan to report my issues to the FDA (Anyone may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088),F,46,28  days 1X D,5/19/2016,Claritin
9, 1, Seasonal allergies,Depression_ suicidal thoughts_ insomnia_ short term memory loss,When I started taking Claritin it did relieve my allergy symptoms but also was unable to sleep at night_ and the few minutes of sleep that I caught here and there I would have nightmares. I was depressed every day_ and at times I would just cry about nothing or something stupid_ also had thoughts of suicide. Boyfriend finally had enough of me one day and asked me what's going on with you you're acting different_ is there something your not telling me. Finally things came to a head one day and was unable to take Claritin for a couple days and all of the sudden I realized I was my normal self again.

Fell asleep and took another this morning and an hour later I could feel my heart pounding and I felt very jittery_ and then started getting anxious. My HR was around 100BPM and normally i'm at 70. I went to urgent care and on my way there my hands started tingling and felt cold_ and my mouth went dry. The doctor said some people have this sort of ""fight or flight"" reaction.

23, 1, Allergies,Stiff and painful joints in hands_ elbows_ knees and hips. Swelling of hands and legs. Vertigo when I would wake up. Horrible bloating and gas that would rise into my chest and burning in my stomach.  Hard time going to Sleep. Hard time concentrating and a bit loopy. No motivation.,I started taking Claritin in May of 2015 for my allergies. I liked it because it did not make me zombie like. It still made me a bit loopy but I could deal with it. I started having  bad joint pain in my hands and knees_ so bad that I could hardly climb up and down stairs. I asked my doc and she said that I was getting old (46) and it was to be expected especially with menopause coming on etc...I did tell her that Claritin was making me a bit loopy and she basically blew me off and said Claritin does not have those type of side effects and that even airplane pilots were allowed to take it because it was so safe. I took her at her word and continued to take the Claritin with no further thought. In October of 2015 I ran out of the Claritin and since it was winter did not pick up anymore hoping that I would not have to worry till spring. Through the holidays my allergies were tolerable and and interestingly (though I did not put 2 and 2 together) my bloating and stomach burning went away_ my joints no longer hurt and started feeling pretty good. About 2 weeks ago I was hit by a bout of allergies and picked up some Claritin. I took the 1st pill on a Thursday  and by Monday I felt the familiar stiffness and pain in my left hand and had horrible bloating. By Wednesday my knees hurt so bad I could hardly walk down the stairs and I could not even close my left hand in a fist and my right hand was also acting up as well as my elbows.

31, 1, Extreme seasonal allergies,"Hyperactive_ racing mind and attention deficit_ in that it was hard to focus on any task for long (ADHD?); increasingly aching joints to the point of real pain_ then ultimately an extreme lower backache (not experienced before Claritin); disrupted sleep (often by the pain mentioned above); suddenly lowered libido; vivid bizarre nightmares_ followed by lingering ""aftershock"" in the morning_ plus exhaustion_ depression and a despairing lack of motivation to do anything. (All of the above on 24-hour Claritin Reditabs_ NO pseudoephedrine - i.e_ NOT Claritin-D.)  I had to take increasingly larger dosages of aspirin_ turmeric_ and finally meloxicam (which pretty much incapacitates me and raises my BP to alarming levels) and xanax_ just to stop the increasingly  excruciating arthritic pain and nightmares_ and to get some sleep.Much like getting a ""fix"" on an illegal drug_ 20 mg of Claritin and coffee would have me allergy-free once again_ emotionally up and ready to go","I would give the basic Claritin two stars_ maybe three_ because at first_ it DID relieve my severe seasonal allergy symptoms amazingly well without drowsiness at 20 mg a day (the recommended dose in many countries other than the US). 10 mg did not seem to relieve allergy symptoms very much at all. Rather than causing ""increased sedation"" as the literature suggests_ the 20 mg actually felt like a shot of espresso at first (and this without pseudoephedrine [Claritin-D] involved). But the boost in energy and motivation lasted no more than 8 hours. The rest of the promised 24 hours was a long period of exhaustion_ insomnia_ inertia_ aching_ irritability_ paranoia_ unexpected feelings of resentment and bitterness.

32, 1, Sinuses_ fluid in inner ear,I have been experiencing some sinus issues_ along with dizziness because of some fluid in my inner ear for about 5 days. So I went to the doctor to get prescribed something to help with the sinuses and dizziness. She prescribes me Alavert (generic for Claritin). I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS MEDICATION AGAIN! Literally within hours of taking my first dose_ I start experincing racing heartbeat all throughout that night. Then right before I try to go to sleep my entire left arm completely falls asleep. So I literally got no sleep that night between my heart feeling like it was pumping out my chest and my arm feeling like 10000 needles are poking it. The next morning I awake up _ my heart has calmed down but my arm is still a very numb. Completely oblivious to the fact that this medication is the reason why I'm feeling all out of wack_ I take another peel right after breakfast_ the rest of the day I felt horrible! My heart continues to race and pound extremely hard_ my arm was still numb as hell and to add on to that My neck/throat was rightening up on me! Felt like my lymph nodes all along my neck were swollen! I have not taken another pill since this morning and I am still experincing the racing heartbeat_numb left arm and swollen lymph nodes in my neck! Trust me the side effects of this pill are not worth it all! Stay way!,If you're experincing racing heartbeat_ get a bucket/bowl of ice cold water and dunk your entire face in for 20-30 secs this helps bring your heart rate down. If it doesn't help the first time you dunk_ try it a couple more times.Doctors use this method when patients come in with racing heartbeat before resorting to medication.

I can see how claritin with pseudoephedrine_ for example_ might result in some of the symptoms being described_ but loratadine itself is such a benign drug_ and has no such contraindications or side effects as some seem to believe it does (on this Web site anyway). It sounds to me that many people here are experiencing nocebo effect_ which is (simply described) the converse effect of placebo.

I have to say the one dose cleared up my problem almost immediately_ but approximately 36 hours after taking it my mouth started to become increasingly dry to the point that I could barely swallow_ and my entire tongue felt as though I had burned it. The worst part was that this extreme dryness in my mouth lasted for 6 days. Any professional I consulted with said it should of been out of my system after 24 hours_ but apparently something remained. By day 6 I was so miserable I felt like I was at my wits end when I started to see some improvement in my saliva production. I will never again freely take any kind of over the counter medicine.

49, 1, Year round allergies,anxiety_ irritability_ anger_ paranoia_  heart palpitation_  hot flashes_ hormone imbalance_,After months of hot flashes_ heart palpitation and anxiety I decided to see my doctor. At first I thought I was going thru menopause however_ blood test results showed a hormone imbalance indicative of hyperthyroidism. Saw an endocrinologist. Initially diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Had blood tests performed for approximately 3 months but_ the T3 and T4 counts varied every single time there was really no pattern.  She was not sure what was going on. There was the question of Graves Disease. I started reading up on Graves and learned that it is an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones. Since Claritin D interacts with the immune system_ I began to wonder about its side effects and if it was possibly causing the hormone imbalance. (of note; Claritin D was the only medication I was taking. I was not and currently not on any other medication) I remembered that I had skipped taking Claritin D on days and/or a week or two in between blood tests.  I began to suspect that Claritin D was the cause of  the hormone imbalance. That's when I decided to stop taking it. I cannot declare Claritin D as the cause of the hormone imbalance. I think that would need to be researched however_ I have had TWO blood tests since I stopped taking ClaritinD and BOTH tests have been normal. I plan on following up with the endocrinologists in about a year. I will be happy to report back then.,F,46,6  years30MG 1X D,3/10/2015Email,Claritin

109, 1, (Hayfever) Allergies,Insomnia after taking Claritin for about 4 days.  I was able to go to sleep but would sleep lightly and then wake up with extreme anxiety which degenerated to panic attacks that would continue for hours.  After a couple of weeks_ I became sleep deprived with continuous anxiety.  I was prescribed meds for anxiety by my doctor because we didn't make the connection to Claritin.  The antianxiety meds didn't really solve the problem and I became listless and forgetful.  When I finally quit taking the Claritin_ I began to be more rested after about 10 days.  When I had another allergy attack_ I started Claritin again and within a week had insomnia and panic attacks.  I realized the Claritin was causing the problems_ so now I stay far away from it.  I did do ONE more test and after just 3 does (3 nights)_ the insomnia started up again.,The connection between the insomnia and Claritin was aided by information from my mother.  She cannot take oral Benadryl or Psuedophed because they both cause insomnia for her_ as does Claritin.  I have no problem with pseudophedine and Benedryl makes me slightly sleepy.,F,44, 10mg 1X D,7/25/2013,Claritin

No_ really - food lost all flavor. Smell started returning about 36 hours later. First thing I could smell again was Chinese food_ but nothing else - could barely even smell rubbing alcohol.

Pharmacy can't refill new Clarinex for about a week (insurance companies suck_ don't they?)_ so with a coupon I bought a 10-pack of Claritin (which contains loratadine - a similar ingredient to Clarinex/desloratadine).  Because I've already been taking my Clarinex for two months_ I didn't notice any new onset of allergy symptoms - the Claritin seems to be keeping things at bay. What I did notice however_ is that after the 2nd dose I am getting up 4x/night to urinate. I am a 51-year-old female and typically don't drink any fluids after dinner so I can hope to sleep 7-8 hours straight_ but the past four nights I've awoken every 2-hours to pee. Thankfully_ I am able to fall right back to sleep (another midlife problem for many - not being able to STAY asleep - try L5HTP!).  Otherwise_ the Claritin seems to be doing it's job for allergy relief.  Will be back on Clarinex this week.,Don't get too excited about everything you read on these blogs.

After one month I noticed a little wheezing and had a chest xray done at my annual physical that was normal  After bout 1 1/2 months the side effects really kicked in and I had chest tightness_ shortness of breath_ unknow origin crying spells and anxiety.  It scared the hell out of me and I ended up going to a cardiologist because I thought I was having a heart attack.  All the tests were normal.  I went to 2 cardiologists and neither of them paid much attention to me putting down using Claritin in my medicine history.  On my own I decided to discontinue the medications and my symptoms for the most part have subsided within 4 days.  I still feel slightly anxious today on day four after stopping the meds and a little dizzy_ however I feel I will be back to baseline with a few days to a week.This website helped me realize I wasn't dying and it was a serious bad reaction to an allegedly safe drug.

147, 3, Seasonal Allergies,"Claritin works better than Zyrtec IMO. If you are prone to anxiety_ it will worsen the anxiety.

It's a natural Mast Cell Stabilizer made from the white rind of lemons or onion peel. The allergy drug Nalcrom is the synthetic version of Quercetin. It's cheap_ effective_ and actually ""good for you"" in that it's a powerful anti-oxidant and will reduce free-radical damage (aging).  ",,M,40,1  months10 mg,9/7/2012,Claritin

152, 1, ,Underlying feeling of nervousness_ volatile_ easily annoyed and enraged_ generally irritable_ frequently irrational and sometimes  down right psychotic.,This drug_ as well as Zyrtec D (and their respective generic brands)_ are incredibly dangerous and destructive to some sensitive peoples psyche and emotions_ and should carry MUCH STRONGER warnings of these risks.  The problem is that they work well in addressing allergies  so a person is anxious to get that relief; however_ to some of us sensitive people_ they cause an underlying feeling of nervousness_ make you volatile_ easily annoyed and enraged_ generally irritable_ frequently irrational and sometimes  down right psychotic.  I am so grateful that after 10 years of struggling with these periodic and totally uncontrollable emotional issues_ my beautiful new boyfriend made me realize that it was the antihistamines causing all of my behavior issues.  OMG  I FINALLY HAVE MY LIFE BACK!!  Do some research on the Internet  the link between psychotic behavior and antihistamines is well documented.  Since stopping these drugs_ I am back to the calm_ rational_ loving and reasonable person I used to be.  DO YOURSELF (and your loved ones) A COLLOSAL FAVOR - if you are taking any antihistamines  get off of them immediately.  Instead_ address your allergies with a saline nasal rinsing system (I do it up to 3 times a day  every day) like the SinuCleanse_ readily available at Walgreens and CVS.

As an adult i started taking Claritin as soon as available_ and my life only got worse from there. Picture not being able to hold down a job due to the inattention and emotional issues.

And all this time thinking that you were innately_ genetically screwed up and unfit to live or breed.I want my life back. I want at least 1 million dollars from the PIG drug companies who dont adequately warn you that this kind of thing happens with their pills. I lost my childhood to this --- and most of my adult life. I had no idea that it could be the problem until i took a Drug Development course and learned about the strange similarity between antipsychotics and antihistamines. I didnt confirm it until i read this site and saw many others having the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS.I need a lawyer willing to take my case_ and possibly those of others on this site - email at jholley3@spsu.edu as soon as possible,M,31,10  years10mg 1X D,5/13/2012Email,Claritin
161, 2, Seasonal allergies,Have taken the drug occasionally (once every couple of weeks or so) for a year. After a doctor recommended it for problems that I did not realize were allergy-related_ I started taking it more frequently (2-3 times a week). I started having episodes where I would have an extreme feeling of horror or depression wash over me_ usually just for a matter of seconds_ but it was very frightening. This seemed to happen just about the same time every time I used Claritin.,I know this drug works very well for a lot of people_ but I think these types of symptoms should be mentioned more prominently because if someone does not know that Claritin could cause them_ their medical treatment could get very complicated.,F,66,1  years 1X D,5/11/2012,Claritin

We were in bed and he woke up for a drink but he wasn't tired so I stayed up with him and about 45 minutes after being up he started to scream that there were bugs in the bedroom. It was so scary because he was really seeing them. He was flailing his arms in the air jumping up  and stomping the bed with his feet. Then he started seeing bubbles_fire and fireworks.

Nothing in my life that was previously important to me seemed important at all_ I was irritable for no explainable reason_ and I spent half an hour sitting in the shower crying because I was just so inexplicably depressed. No more Claritin_ no more depression. Now_ I'm happy as a clam. Also_ when I would stand up and try to walk_ I couldn't see for a good 30 seconds because I was just so dizzy every time I tried to stand. This also went away as soon as I stopped taking Claritin.,It really did get rid of my allergies. They didn't bother me ONCE while I was taking it.

I can't fall asleep_ I actually played an online game for 3 days with only 4 hours of sleep on the second day. I get ridiculous insomnia while taking Claritin. The ingredients were Loratadine USP 10 MG and Pseudoephedrine sulfate USP 240 MG. One tablet per day. Fortunately_ when I do stop taking Claritin_ my erections become 100% full power again after a couple days of being off of Claritin. I've had no permanent side effects from it.

Please do not take Claritin or any generics of it with the 5HTP as it will prevent the 5HTP to relax the moods. When that happens_ side effects will occur fast. I am very unsatisfied with this. It was my parents' idea to have me take it and I was so blind until I found this. I know I respect my parents_ but I don't only when they make stuff up. Good thing the people experienced this as well. For me_ I have hypertension autism. This anger has never happened to me when I don't take Claritin. For such a long time if I tried to remember taking one as a child_ it happened to me for the first time as of 2012. I have to be constant vigilant myself and my family.

186, 2, Allergies,None.,"It didn't do anything for me. However_ I'm reading all these side effects other people are mentioning and I'm scratching my head. Depression? Anxiety? Nightmares? Loss of sleep? Irritability? I've had sleep problems my whole life and I've had anxiety issues before_ but I slept like a baby while on Claritin (taken right before bed as I find my allergies get worse at night) and I didn't feel any more keyed up than usual. But I would be as reluctant to claim Claritin helps you sleep or relax (which in my case I could_ as I slept just fine and felt fine while taking it) as I'd be claiming it causes wild and immediate brain chemistry fluctuations. Upset stomach? Quite possible. Dizziness or headaches? Maybe. But confusion? Hysteria? Somebody even mentions ""out of body"" experiences. Wow. You'd think we're talking about LSD here. You know what else could be causing all these symptoms_ besides Claritin? Anticipation. Catastrophic thinking. Hypochondria. Fearful thinking. All unhealthy behavioral patterns of people who are already prone to having emotional issues. I know someone who is afraid of elevators. Every time he even imagines himself in one he feels jittery_ anxious_ his palms sweat_ he experiences wild mood swings_ he even falls into a deep depression. But even he is reluctant to claim elevators per se are the CAUSE of all those symptoms. Just my 2 cents. Out of curiosity_ I checked some other medications randomly.

She was completely awake so it wasn't night terrors. It was very scary for my husband and I. She seemed almost outside of herself. I will never ever give claritin to my children again. And thanks to claritin my daughter has a new found fear of bugs. And this happened to her at least 30 hours after her last dose. I'm sure it was the claritin because of the shocking similarities to other stories on this website. Thank god i found an explanation to what happened to my usually sweet little 3 year old.

I've recently been taking the dissolves-on-tongue variety which is quite convenient_ and relief lasts at least 24 hours with one or two exceptions over the course of abt. 3 weeks. very satisfied. granted_ in Canada this was OTC and only recently (last 10 years?) it has become otc in the U.S._ and I think it may be a slightly different composition. but again_ I have taken in both countries with similarly good effects. to lighten the mood in here_ here's a little piece on sneezing that I found amusing! http://www.purematters.com/healthy-body/allergies/sneezing-why-a-nose-blows thanx. -steve,M,27,21  days? 1X D,8/16/2011,Claritin

219, 1, Allergies,I started taking these pills (generic Walmart brand) just 3 days ago and it took only one day for my mood to completely change. I have never felt such rage_ anger_ uncontrollable mood swings_ wanting to cry_ and generally just feeling like I'm possessed or something. I didn't even correlate the two until on a whim I did a google search for claritin mood swings and found this site. I think if I would have continued taking this med I would have done some serious damage to my personal and business life because this newfound temper had me cursing and yelling like I've never done before. Please be aware and spread the word on this possible side effect. I wouldn't be surprised if someone hasn't seriously harmed another while taking this drug.  We all thought Prozac was safe until people started getting suicidal on it_ Claritin is no different.,I don't know why it seems some people can take claritin with no side effects and some become raging lunatics. I suppose the biochemistry of the brain is more sensitive than we expect. It's a shame I can't take this because my allergies are gone_ but I'll deal with a runny nose any day and not this crazy feeling. I read that it takes 3 days to get back to normal.

I did some research and found out that Claritin daily may be the cause of my low libido. I stopped taking doses yesterday_ and I already feel more sexually aware.

I'm on no other medication at all_ had a full breakfast and drank one 6-oz cup of coffee.  The first few hours I was amazed; the Claritin dried up my sinuses just great.

275, 3, 2,irritability_ fatigue_ sadness_ moody_ easily upset_ down_ stomach pain_ body pain,"Based on doctors recommendation gave Claritin to my 4 year old son for last year_ on and off _ for his allergic symptoms.  I too have noticed that he seems different the day after and a few days after taking loratidine.  He is usually very happy and playful_ but after this medicine he is detached_ aloof_ easily upset_ cries more easily and not his usual happy go lucky self.  First I thought it was due to his other gastrointestinal disorder of esophageal esophagitis which is very painful when eating and another manifestion of ""allergies"" but in this case to food allergies. He has both seasonal_ environmental and food allergies_ so it is difficult at times to know what is affecting him.  I do see a correlation between taking loratidine and ""more"" stomach pain the next day.  I have been suspecting this medication for sometime and believe it is partly responsible for his stomach pain in addition to his own medical condition.  We give him claritin or benadryl to relieve his extreme upper respiratory congestion at times_ so bad that at times his nose is completely blocked and cannnot sleep.  Both medications work for reducing upper airway congestion and nasal congestion_ etc_ but I am thinking of trying decongestants instead or a humidifier_ vaporizer or something like that to avoid the side effects of meds. Doctors also recommend nasal sprays or steroid nose sprays to reduce the nasal inflammation.  I agree that this medication should not be given to children a",M,4,1  years10 3X W,12/22/2010,Claritin

I have multiple allergies (even severely allergic to perfumes_ etc) and generally feel crappy all the time without allergy medication.  After years of taking both nasal and internal medicines someone told me about Claritin while it was stilll a prescription.  The difference when taking it is like night and day.  Suddenly I simply felt .... just well.  Clear headed_ able to function.  Now if I skip a dose I often get neckaches which I think are actually related to sinus pressure_ and I feel blurry and unable to focus.  I generally take it every day with no ill effects.

I began taking it in 2001 and stopped in 2006.  My side effect symptoms began in 2005.  As of today_ I still have these symptoms_ although the feelings of doom and fear have subsided a great deal.

Definitely controls my allergies but concerned by the new side effects. 24 hour generic Walmart normal Claritin (not the D version).,Should only be used when needed and not as a daily preventative. Would not recommend for children under 18 since they may not be able to cope with strange mental effects. Label should caution about nightmares and emotional reactions.

I gave him a pill before he left in the afternoon and got a call that he was ill with nausea and diarrhea but after talking it over with my mom decided it was probably all the junk food he had eaten. He was still ill the next day but still I gave him a 2nd dose. At that time I decided it was a bug and didnt give him the pill because he was just puking it up anyway. A week at school and no allergies_ I dismissed the claritin and when he was stuffy at the diner table gave him a pill after eating around 6. At midnight my son woke up with the same sickness as last weekend only I was able to witness the uncontrollable shaking all over his body. I was about to take him to the ER and while waiting for him to use the restroom I found this site. I am very disappointed that these side effects are not printed on the box. I was scared to death at his reaction! I am sti,Use with caution! I know many that are good with this drug_ it just wasn't good for my son. These side effects really need to be addressed on the package. I almost called an ambulance for my son.,M,8,2  times10mg 1X D,5/19/2010Email,Claritin
331, 2, Severe seasonal allergies,Crying_ emotional outbursts_ mood swings,We started giving the Childrens Claritin oral solution to our 7 year old son after the doctor recommended it for his allergies.  Our normally cheerful son kept having terrible crying fits over the slightest problems.  He would almost be inconsolable.  I just made the connection this morning before school when he was hysterically crying.  This medication helped his allergies somewhat_ but the side effects aren't worth it. I'm going to find something else for my son.,M,7,4  days5 mg 1X D,5/18/2010,Claritin
332, 3, seasonal allergies,I've been suffering seasonal allergies since I was a kid. (30+ years). I've tried many remedies over the years. Claritin 10 mg in the past has been helpful for my sneezing and runny nose_ but it didn't help the itchy eyes. When my allergies acted up this week_ I started with Claritin 10 mg daily...but found it was wearing off at about 18 hours_ and would take a second 10 mg dose. I still had some rough nights of sneezing and runny nose--which is not unusual with my seasonal allergies. The non-sedating antihistamines don't seem to work for me. The past few days_ I noticed I had zero patience with my kids_ which is completely out of character. They would ask a simple question and in 5 seconds I would get completely irritated--it was like an anxiety attack (tense). The simplest annoyances extremely bothered me. At first I thought the irritability was due to lack of sleep. But as it kept happening_ I realized it was not sleep deprivation_ it was something more. I began investigating wheter,,F,43,7  days10 mg 2X D,5/16/2010,Claritin
333, 1, Seasonal Allergies,At first I had no side effects from Claritin.  I liked the fact that it worked_ but I didn't notice any side effects.  ( I do not take medications much and consider myself very healthy...take vitamins and eat well.) At some point I started getting dizzy and very confused_ but did not know what was causing it until finding this website after two months of taking Claritin 24 hour every day.  Also_ my hair was falling out...not a problem before taking Claritin. After about two months of continual use the confusion was so bad that I had to second guess every move I made.  I was feeling psychotic with continual anxiety right before I stopped taking it.  My eyesight was also beginning to be affected and reading was difficult.  After finding this site_ I immediately stopped taking Claritin.  The next day after stopping the drug I noticed that my dizziness was a lot less. The confusion was gradually less. But on day three with no Claritin my symptoms actually got worse. On day four off the d,The longer this drug is in your system_ the more lethal it gets.

335, 1, Seasonal (spring) allergies,My daughter was prescribed loratidine for her seasonal allergies last year and was instructed to take it the entire year. However_ since she only has spring allergies I only give it to her during the spring. Last year she was only on it maybe 2 months. This year her allergies started much sooner thanks to a much warmer end to winter. She has been experiencing urinary frequency and incontinence. She has also been experiencing emotional outbursts_ meltdowns_ irritability_ forgetfulness_ etc. that we originally likened to an age/stage; however_ this past weekend when we forgot to give her the loratidine for an extended 3 day weekend ALL of these symptoms disappeared!,The fact that these symptoms/side effects were not disclosed is VERY concerning! A head's up would have been preferred so that when the first symptoms/side effects started happening we could have stopped the loratidine and saved my daughter a lot of embarrassment and hardship! We will be stopping the loratidine immediately after this morning's dose!,F,8,4  months10 mg 1X D,5/6/2010,Claritin

I have just noticed that I have been sleeping all night long.,Before_ Claritin I used to got o bed very late & getting up very early_ but after claritin it makes me sleep all night and sometimes in the afternoon_ if I am not working. I am not complaning_ maybe I needed all the sleep I am having. That is the reason I tryed to check the web to find out if someone is having the same side effetcs. I did find a few ones with the same as mine. However_ I was surprised that so many had depressions_ pains_ etc. I am glad that its only make me sleep more that I normally sleep.

Tried Claritin this year; no question_ it works great on the allergy symptoms (that's why I still give it a passable rating). I did not take the drug every day as sometimes allergy is tolerable_ that's how I was able to connect the dizziness with the drug. Side effects are simply the pits_ can hardly get anything done at work. I am in good health with normal blood pressure_ can't imagine what this could do to someone with existing health issues. Unless I find another medicine without those effects_ I'd rather deal with the sneezing_ itchy eyes and runny nose at any time.,M,51,10  days30 mg 1X D,5/4/2010,Claritin

The last day I remember being happy was a couple of days before I started taking this medication.  I thought that I was going crazy_ but then I started to put two and two together and realized that my depression could be coming from the CLARITIN.  I've done everything in my power to fight the oncoming depression_ I've excercised and ate organic and healthy foods(and have actually GAINED weight!) I've been taking vitamins_ minerals and natural mood lifters_ and every day my depression has gotten worse.  I have to force myself to do the things that usually make me the happiest_ and it's AWFUL.  I hate taking medications the side effects always seem to outweigh the benefits... ugh...

Within the hour he couldn't stop crying and felt dizzy.  He had a major meltdown and said it made his head feel like it wasn't his.  He was anxious and depressed all at once.  He cried and screamed at the top of his lungs non-stop for over an hour and half saying he couldn't stop!,We made him drink water to try to flush his system.  He eventually fell asleep after 10:30pm.  I need to contact my family doctor this morning to follow up once my son wakes up.  I am very concerned!

384, 1, to control sinuse drainage,"I was used to running nearly every day 2-3 miles. I went from that to barely dragging myself out of bed. I had no motivation to do ANYTHING. I seemed to not care about anything all of a sudden. And I have a family to take care of!! I finally pinpointed my sense of fatigue and feeling like I was ""lazy"" to starting at the time I went on Claritin. (just regular Claritin 10 mg 24 hour)I experienced a TOTAL lack of motivation_ depression_ fatigue_ bloating_ weight gain_ increased sense of irritability_ sense of being in a fog as other reviewers have noted. I also had problems focusing as if I could not get it together_ my mind would race from thing to thing. And no matter how much I slept I felt like I was not well rested.I was disappointed since it seemed to really be helping my sinus problems_ but it is not worth it.",,F,34,30  days,10/1/2009,Claritin

No depression_ anger or insomnia.,I have had occasional nights of vivid dreams before_ but when I started having them every night I knew that there must be some external catalyst.

He has always been the sweetest little boy_ and I'm not just saying that because he's mine.  He's been on it for two and a half weeks_ and in those two weeks we've had uncontrollable emotional issues.  He is in a private preschool_ and has gotten sent home because excessive crying_ and cries here at home too while he just seems sad.  We gave up our nap time the middle of this summer_ he didn't want to sleep so it was a fight.

But within an hour of going to bed_ I was awake with anxiety and a racing heart.  I never have insomnia_ so this is abnormal for me.

It was suggested by my ENT to help this problem and it worked wonders. I had a hysterectomy 6 yrs ago and do occasionally get PMS type symptoms so at first when my breasts became sore and I gained a couple of lbs_ I thought nothing of it. By the end of the 2 weeks I was constantly waking at night_ the skin on my face was extremely dry_ I was loosing hair by the hand fulls_ my breasts were so sore I couldn't even stand to have a sheet lay against them and I had gained 10lbs!!

This season I started taking it about 2 weeks prior to allergy season and that really helped control the symptoms.  I have been doing great on it for over a month_ and just within the last 2 weeks or so I've started feeling so tired and exhausted despite getting tons of sleep. I just crave my bed_ like in the middle of the day.  I have no energy.  I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all_ and now in the last serveral days I've been feeling very depressed_ angry and overwhelmed for no apparent reason.  I have no history of depression or anxiety or anything else.  I didn't really associate it with the claritin because I've been taking it for so many weeks without a problem.  But for the last 2 days I haven't taken the claritin_ and I am starting to feel much better.  I was thrilled to be expriencing what I thought was no side effects with Claritin (as I had a lot of negative side effects with zytrec).  Perhaps the levels in your body continue to increase which is why it took a while for me to feel both the positive and negative effects of the drug.,F,45,40  days,9/7/2009Email,Claritin
393, 3, Fall Allergies,I have taken Claritin and the generics...Rite aid_ etc.It does work on the allergy symptom control which can be debiliting_ but this site is confirming my suspicions that the drug is contributing to my anger management issues.  I have 2 angels for kids that can test patience of course_ but this drug lowers all tolerance thresholds.  And the constant light-headed feeling gets a little old.  I was training for a triathlon this fall_ so I can blame the drug for my lack of exercise stamina as well. I will confirm the crazy dream posting as well.

395, 1, allergies/cough,My son-10 years old_ started Claritin for a cough he's had for a few weeks.  I noticed soon after starting he started having major temper tantrums and was unable to control his anger.  He became very aggressive and unmanageable.  He has had episodes of this in the past_ but nothing recently.  Now I'm wondering if perhaps each episode was during a time that he was on Claritin &/or Singular.  I've taken him off the Claritin_ and his mood has drastically changed.  Coincidence?  Who knows_ but I think I'll avoid this drug in the future- especially with all the others here who've had similar experiences!!,,M,10,2  weeks,9/2/2009,Claritin
396, 1, pet and seasonal allergies,INCREDIBLY sore and stiff muscles to the point of not being able to walk. Fatigue that was so bad I would have to lay down and then I'd fall asleep for a couple of hours at a time. Sleeping 10-12 hours a night and still being very tired when I woke up. Shuffling my way out of bed due to the pain and stiffness. Depression and anxiety to the point that I thought I was going crazy.  I was crying and getting angry at friends and family so randomly! Made me downright mean. If I hadn't found this site and gotten off this awful drug_ I was on my way to therapy very soon!  Red eyes that I never even got with my allergies. IBS type symptoms with gas_ bloating_ and diarrhea. Frequent urination with the feeling that I still had to go right after I went - sometimes painful to go. Severe dehydration. Daily abdominal cramping.  PMS was off the charts. Period was painful - barely ever got a little cramp before. Lack of motivation. Went from working out daily to forcing myself to do it half-ass a coup,10mg a day is an overdose for the average person. When I started this stuff I took it as needed and only had small physical and mental nags that I never connected with the drug.  Then I increased it to every and the nags grew but I still didn't make the connection.  I decided to take it as prescribed on the box because I thought the nags meant it wasn't working. Taking it every day literally incapacitated me!  I went off it a week ago and have noticed a huge improvement in my overall quality of life! My normal physical and mental self is coming back.  I guess it takes 10-14 days to leave the system completely.  I can't wait till it's gone! A class action lawsuit would be a great idea! I didn't see any of those side effects on the bottle!,F,27,1  years,8/28/2009,Claritin
397, 1, allergies-mostly congestion,Claritin D 24hr I was having problems sleeping due to congestion and decided to try this. The first night was great_ slept all night w/o stuffiness. Second night_ it didn't help at all_ so I decided to skip a few days. Took it again after two days and it still didn't help the congestion but I was plagued with constant itching all over my body that night and in the morning I noticed I was having a difficult time with my vision_ my right eye would get hazy and unfocused. Later that day_ I started to have mild anxiety attacks (I am on anti-anxiety meds and have been fine for years) but did not attribute it to the Claritin. Also_ I was extremely moody and angry and figured I must be starting menopause.  The next night I took yet another in hopes of getting some sleep. I feel asleep only to be jerked away about 40 minutes later with the sensation of falling. Fell back to sleep and it happened again_ and continued to get progressively worse and more frequent to the point that I would just do,NEVER AGAIN!

398, 2, pet allergy / seasonal congestion,agressive behavior_ moodiness_ whininess_ appetite changes_ sleep problems_ crying outbursts_ blatant disobedience,It all started with our son taking Zyrtec on and off as needed for over a year.  We thought he was just a high-maintenance strong-willed child.  It wasn't until he started taking it daily for a couple weeks straight that he became completely unbearable.  We would have honestly sworn the devil had possession over our child_ that's the best way I can describe what happened.  It wasn't until I found this site that it made me think it was the medicine causing it.  I stopped giving it to him_ and within a couple days_ he was a completely different child.  Much easier to manage_ more agreeable_ and overall happy.  I thank whoever created this site_ and just wanted to post our story_ so maybe someone else who experiences the same thing can learn from our misery!  We have since tried Claritin_ and after about two straight weeks of using it_ it caused the same symptoms.  Even after being off it_ we gave it to him on an as-needed basis a couple times and the personality change was almost immediate.  No more Claritin for him!  Now we are on Allegra_ time will tell how that fares...,M,4,14  days,8/13/2009Email,Claritin

I was in the bathroom one day and I was talking to myself and then I stopped when I realized what I was doing_ It made me think of all kinds of random things_ very scary.

But I took it as needed at first - but then found it worked quicker for my allergy symptoms if I took it every day and kept it in my system during the allergy season. However within a week of taking it every day it began to make me feel very_ very_ very anxious and tense.  I felt so tense I kept having to remind myself to take deep breaths.  At first I blamed it on hormones_ but then realized it was the Claritin.  I have stopped taking it.

It has made me extremely irritable and unable to get a good nights' sleep - no matter how long I sleep for I'm always tired. I'm also taking a Pychiatric medication (Lamictal)_ and I think that Claritin reacts poorly with it.

The dehydration can be headed off by drinking a lot of water_ and the other side effects are mild and a small price to pay for not having to be itchy all day. I would say_ from my experience_ that Claritin is great when you have just spent a weekend in the woods getting eaten alive by bugs.,F,23,30  days,6/18/2009,Claritin

413, 3, General Pollen Allergies,Moodiness_ irritability_ fatigue all stemming from general depression.,First of all_ the only way this stuff works for me is if I take one at night then one in the morning effectively giving me 10-20Mg of Loritidine in my system at a time. Lab studies have shown this is okay to do on a phyisical basis. That being said_ I knew something was up because I had this issue LAST YEAR with Zyrtec. The prolonged use of Citirizine was causing general depression within me to the point where I didn't really care about much and about halfway through the day I would cease normal mental processes (Think fuzzy brain). I'm doing nearly the same thing this time around with Loritidine. Changes: I'm less fuzzy but am really tired even though my routine hasn't changed in over a year and I'm slightly more irritable. Claritin has definatly helped me stifle my allergies though. I would recommend taking it on a short term basis of less than 7 days at a time.,M,23,1.5  months,6/10/2009,Claritin
414, 1, Allergies,Insomnia.  Oddly I was taking it because I kept waking up at night congested and hard to breath.  The insomnia was amazing.  I just couldn't sleep.  I'd sleep an hour or two a night.  This went on for a month.  The other primary side effect is anger.  I became very temperamental and angry about everything.  I stopped taking it because it stopped working_ and that's how I figured out the insomnia.  I'd known about the anger and was accepting of it to be able to breath.  I have also experienced irregular bowel movements_ but I cannot concretely link this to the Claritin yet.  I am on no other medication.,I think it works fine for many people and you should try it yourself_ don't not take it solely on account of my experience.I've taken this drug every allergy season for 4-5 years.  This past time it was 90 consecutive days.  I take the 24 hour version_ the 12 hour version I find does not alleviate symptoms as well.  I take exclusively the brand name_ I have tried Costco and Target brand generics and they do not work as well.,M,35,90  days,6/8/2009Email,Claritin
415, 1, allergies,I took Claritin last night and this morning I woke up seriously depressed.  I noticed some suicidal thoughts before going to bed.  I also awoke with some slight ringing in my ears and I just feel really fatigued.,I took Claritin b/c I have interstitial cystitis (possible flare due to allergies) along with multiple allergies to things I probably don't even know about along with those I do.  I had allergy shots as a kid and take flonase.  I tried Zyrtec but had a rash from that (?).  I also think I'm allergic to my dog.  I have a history of depression and anxiety.  I was pretty stable for about 4 or 5 days before I took the Claritin and my mood switched drastically from when I took it and when I woke up.  It could be a coincidence but this is scary.  I don't want to chance taking another dose and will stop this and see how I am mood wise tomorrow.  I'm glad there is this site to see that it may be the med.  I don't need more help with depression_ I can get that on my own.,F,36,1  days,6/4/2009Email,Claritin
416, 1, Allergies,My 22month old has been coughing_ runny nose_ sneezing and everything else you can think of for allergies for the past 3 weeks. We started with Benadryl and only seemed to work at night and not during the day. I talked with our Pediatrician and she recommended half a dose of children's Claritin before bed. We gave it to him at 7:30pm and he was bouncing off the walls for 3 hours. Then we gave it to him again last night before bed and he woke up around 11:00pm screaming uncontrollably and saying NO NO NO. He was hiting_ screaming_ kicking_ and acting like something was after him. We brought him back to bed with us and sure enough he woke up several more times screaming. He has not been himself today. When I did some researchand found this website I couldn't believe some of the things I was reading. I HATE CLARITIN and will never recommend it for children.,This is an awful over the counter drug and should not be recommended for kids. Claritin has awful side affects and it brings out a nasty personality in your child you never want to see.,M,2,2  days,6/4/2009Email,Claritin

After taking one dose of 24hr Claritin I find I am awake in the middle of the night because I am anxious and worried about choking. Completely irrational yet I cannot keep the thought out of my mind. I am watching infomercials because they are bland enough to not make me think of other topics and helping me stay distracted from my own thoughts. Tried to watch a video of a hobby(scuba) and had to turn it off because I couldn't help thinking that it was too dangerous and maybe I should quit! This is nuts! They don't warn you about this.

I would consider taking Flonase or something more local rather than suffer from the strange side affects.,F,21,2  months,5/3/2009,Claritin
431, 1, allergies,A few days ago I tried Claritin D and on 5/1/09 I woke up 2am with tremors as if I were freezing. I closed my window but realized I did not feel cold but could not stop shaking_and became nausea and unable to get my words out stuttering (which has never happened). I managed to call a family member they could not understand me on the phone but came and rushed me to the hospital. The doctor first thought it was an severe anxiety attack however I was found to be having multiple seizures. I am a healthy adult other than the season allergies. My family informed him the only thing I had took was the claritn D for the 1st time. Tonic Clonic Seizures as a result of Claritin D is what the emergency doctor called it! This should be BANNED!!!! it's day #two and I am still have stuttering and minor convulsion they gave me RX Ativan and to now follow up with a neurologist. I was and still am feeling scared also slight tremors. Help....how can I flush this out of my system? I've been drinking plenty,,F,41,3  days,5/2/2009Email,Claritin

433, 2, allergies,My 6-year old son has been taking Claritin for 10 days.  He has been agitated_ angry and depressed.

I ran across this site and about 95% of what everyone else has experienced_ I have also experienced to some degree.  I now will only take this if my allergies are more than miserable.  I did have relief from my allergies.,F,34,2  months,4/24/2009,Claritin
435, 4, Seasonal Allergies,During the three days that I took Claritin I didn't experience any strange side effects_ HOWEVER_ on the fourth day I decided NOT to take it_ and wow... I seriously think this drug should be banned. I started getting dizzy-like symptoms_ more like Vertigo_ but oddly_ my allergy symptoms were gone. It's been the third week off of Claritin_ and I still have this terrible off-balance feeling. For a few days it felt like gravity was pushing me backwards_ so I felt like I had to lean backwards all the time. Now it feels like the ground is springy or something_ almost like when you've been on a boat for a really long time_ and then you get off and you still feel like you're floating on water. Yeah... it's really strange. I'm getting very worried so my doc ordered a CT scan to see if there's anything wrong with my brain. I seriously hope not. I vow never to take Claritin again_ oh_ and I think it triggered my asthma as well_ which I haven't had since I was a kid. I HATE CLARITIN!!!,,F,21,3  days,4/23/2009,Claritin

438, 2, Sneezing,After reading all these other comments_ I now realize that the rash on my face that hasn't gone away for a year_ as well as the unexplained 10 pound gain of water retention_ swelling of the face_ and my lack of sex drive may all be related to it.  I thought these were all seperate problems affecting me for various unexplained reasons.  I stopped taking the Claritin about 4 months ago_ but still have rash and low sex drive.  (Lost the 10 pound of water in days and face swelling!)  Will the rash ever go away?,The product always helped my alergies_ and after an ear operation_ I even found that doubling the perscription kept my ears and sinuses dry and normal.  Now years later_ after taking it daily_ I think these other issues with my health may be related.  Both my dermotologist and internal medical doctor can't explain the rash on my cheek_ and I am worried it may never go away_ and that I may not regain my sex drive_ even after I stopped taking it.  Is that possible?,M,42,3  years,4/19/2009Email,Claritin
439, 2, Allergy,I had INTENSE anxiety. Mild depression... scattered thinking_ sometimes found myself doing very strange things for no reason. I have had anxiety disorders in the past but have managed to find coping mechanisms and medicines to alleviate them. This med sent them OVERDRIVE.  This is the second time Ive tried this drug and had this reaction (one month ago had the same experience_ but though it might have just been coincidence),I would suggest that if you are prone to anxiety you think very carefully about the dosage you take. Perhaps experiment with half or maybe even less than half of a pill before going all the way in. About 20 hours since i took it_ and the negative effects are still there but wearing off. ,M,25,1  days,4/16/2009,Claritin
440, 2, Allergies,This is not the D Version! Many ratings on here I think include the D which is pseudoephedrine. I cannot take the D for it makes me not necessarily have more anxiety but very irritable_ angry and borderline psychotic. :) Claritin worked for my allergies but completely zapped my libido and made me not be able to go south of the border. I decided to give Clarinex a try and it made me feel real uneasy and unsettled and increased my anxiety level(I do have an anxiety disorder).,Tried Claritin and Clarinex-helped allergies but made me feel uneasy_ unsettled_ and made me not be able to perform in bed. Zyrtec worked well within an hour but it does make you a little sleepy. I did take allegra 180mg in the past but gave me a headache so I am going to try taking it again at a lower dose of 60mg twice per day and see if that helps. If no success with that I may give zyrtec another try and see if the drowsiness goes away. So not much luck so far.,M,36,4  days,4/9/2009,Claritin
441, 2, Allergies,I was frequently developing sinus infections due to allergies.  My doctor recommended I take Flonase and Claritin-D to knock it out of my system.  The first 4 days_ seemed relatively o.k.  I could definitely breathe better (but did feel a little anxious and slightly dizzy).  On the 5th night_ I started having hallucinations that my husband was standing accross the dark bedroom waving at me.  I looked next to me_ and he was there sound asleep.  I had to shake my head and rub me eyes several times before my vision and head became clear.  I was so paranoid_ I wouldn't get out of bed for any reason until the sun came up.  I don't have any evidence that this was caused by Claritin-D (Flonase??)_ but I have never experienced any feeling like this before.,,F,28,5  days,4/8/2009Email,Claritin

Each time_ afterabout an hour_ I got a headache/earache over the left side ofmy head.  It was bad enough that I lay down until I fell asleep.I rarely get headaches  (maybe one or two a year) ... and neverbad enough that I stop whatever I'm doing to take a nap. The headaches were so alike and in such a specific part of my headthat I can only attribute them to the Claritin since I've neverhad anything like them except when I've taken Claritin. ,The medication did help my allergy symptoms_but the headache wasn't worth the symptom relief.,F,52,3  times,3/22/2009,Claritin

I would rather take those than the side effects from Loratidine. It is effective in stopping the red hot welts I usually get with the shots. I just wish I wouldnt feel like I'm panicked or about to cry for no reason. I also was nervous driving back home because of the dizziness.,F,24,3  days,3/13/2009,Claritin

On the third day_ today_ I woke up at 6am with anxiety. Throughout the day the anxiety increased until I was very short of breath and sweating with a pounding heartbeat. Luckily_ my heartbeat and respiration are returning to normal_ but it has been 3-4 hours and I took Kava kava to treat my anxiety.,It did help my congestion_ and I think some of the swelling went down in my eyes and face (I swell with environmental allergies)_ but I was completely lackluster until I began quietly freaking out. It's really not a lot of fun and it took up a lot of my study time.,F,21,3  days,3/10/2009,Claritin
448, 2, coughing_ sneezing_ itching,I will preface this by saying I am not yet positive that the Claritin is directly impacting my son's behavior. 2 weeks ago_ my 6 year old was started on Zyrtec. Then a week ago_ his pediatrician suggested Claritin & we switched to that. For the past week_ my son has had increased difficulty in school with his behavior_ activity_ impulse control_ and mood (easily upset_ hard to control his emotions). The mood issue is particularly concerning. While he has his active_ impulsive days sometimes_ he hasn't been having tantrums or whining at school at all for some time.,I am going to stop the medicine and see if he has an improvement in behavior. My son may have undiagnosed ADHD and/or some sensory issues (we've recently made a referral for an evaluation with a developmental pediatrician)_ so it may just be that he's more sensitive to the med than the average child. I just wanted to post this to make parents aware (especially if their child is active_ sensitive_ etc.) that if there is a change in behavior that coincides with the start of this medication_ that they might want to consider stopping the Claritin. I did call Claritin's customer service #_ and 3 of the 4 common side effects for children (listed to me by the customer service rep) include nervousness_ fatigue_ and hyperactivity,M,6,8  days,3/4/2009,Claritin

450, 1, ,Seasonal allergy symptoms,My biggest complaint is a dry cotton mouth.  After two weeks_ I noticed I was constantly sucking or chewing on my tongue or the inside of my mouth!  I increased my water intake_ but to no avail. Taking a whole dose once a day made my mind race and turned me into a crazy woman.  I couldn't think straight.  So I tried taking a half tablet twice a day.  I did that for two weeks. I_ too_ experienced sudden flashes of anger which came out of nowhere.  They were fleeting (and didn't happen every day) but they were frightening.  Shortness of breath slowed me down.  My husband wasn't thrilled with my loss of libido.  I do have one positive thing to say about it -- it DID help with clarity -- my brain didn't feel so fuzzy when I was on it -- but it's not worth the tongue-chewing_ dry mouth!    I stopped taking it two days ago and got my energy and libido back.  My husband is smiling  :-)  I'm still sucking my tongue_ though.  It's quite annoying.,F,55,1  months,3/4/2009,Claritin

Sometimes ringing ears.,After 6 months of taking the daily pill and a benedril at night_ I didnt take them for a couple days and my right Eustachian tube blocked   voices sounded like they were far away down a tunnel_ I thought it was excess wax.  I went to the doctor and was told that I didnt have excess wax_ the problem was in my inner ear and something to do with a reverse vacuum and to take Claritin and it would be fixed!  Doctors know this fixes the problem but dont tell you that going off of it can cause the problem!But now whenever I try to stop taking Claritin in just one day my ear clogs up again and this doesnt work for my job that includes a lot of meetings!  I am going to try taking the 12 hr kind once a day to slowly get off of it! Benadryl may make me sleepy but coffee helps counteract it and I dont have side effects when I dont take it.

Possibly also caused bouts of short temper and snapping at my family.,Cleared my sinuses but did not help with coughing.  Spending time in a retail store with superb a/c and ventilation did a better job of stopping symptoms temporarily than Claritin did.  Agree with other reviewers this drug should not be OTC but SHOULD require Rx.  There should be a very clear warning about possibility of 'foggy head'_ and depressive symptoms in particular.  IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO MARKET THIS DRUG AS NON-DROWSY as it easily leads the consumer to believe there is little danger of not being able to function normally at home and at work_ NOT TO MENTION DRIVING A VEHICLE.  BE VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN TAKING THIS DRUG.  I would start taking it over the weekend or when you can stay home for a couple of days to be able to asses what side effects you may experience.  Also_ if you have family_ it would be good to have another grownup around to care for the kids in case you feel foggy or have depressive symptoms.

479, 1, Seasonal alergies,Body aches everywhere_ muscle and joint aches_ felt like I had just been in a fight! Have been using it for a couple of months per year as the allergy season dictates. While it has always made me tired_ never has made me sleepy_ started taking 2 hour afternoon naps. Made me hungry_ started eating more food than normal.  My wife has been asking me what I'm mad about? I felt very sad_ disappointed and angry with everything. Guess my body has changed and does not tolerate claritin any more.,Noticed urinary problems_ hard to go and had to go more often. Listless_ is a good word description of how I felt.  When I forced my self to take care of my daily responsibilities I became angry and hard to get along with. Strange!! I'm usually easy to get along with. Wife really noticed a change when I started the medicine.,M,55, ,10/11/2008Email,Claritin

I didn't connect any of these symptoms until I quit taking Claritin. I had a major breakout of hives & quit taking this & began taking other meds prescribed by the ER. So far_ my leg swelling has disappeared_ along with my anxiety & my energy level has been great.

484, 3, Allergies,Took for a few weeks and didn't notice any side-effects and was very happy with it.  Then I started just taking it on and off_ and the side-effects/withdrawal was very noticable - jittery legs_ anxiety_ worrying_ insomnia (when I never have insomnia ever)_ wierd dreams_ and worst of all - blowing up in anger/frustration at the smallest problem.  Seemed to dramatically decrease my tolerance level for irritation/stress.  Not sure if these are side-effects or an unusual withdrawal.  Taking another tablet the next day removed all the feelings of anxiety... until I didn't take another the next day again.,Worked like a charm to clear up sinusitus_ running nose and headaches... But watch out for mental/physical side effects.  Took the drug on and off for several days.,F,26,4  weeks,9/29/2008,Claritin
485, 1, seansonal allergies,My 8 year old son was perscribed claritin because of seasonal allergies. He was a very outgoing kid and was very easy going. After about a week of taking claritin his mood changed and he became very irratable and his would have very bad mood swings. I thought that it was just a faze that he was going through and continued to give it to him. I had a conference with his teacher and found out that he was not paying attention in class and when she would address him about it he would say that he couldn't help it_ it just happens. The teacher was concerned and wanted to test him for ADD. He was a straight A student last year so I was lost and didn't understand why the sudden change. I decided to do some ressearch and I'm so glad that I found this web site. I will be sharing this info with everyone that I know. Especially with his teacher.,My son will never take claritin again.,F,,25  days,9/27/2008,Claritin
486, 1, to avoid taking singulair,This drug made me crazy.  Anxiety.  Nervousness.  Sleeplessness. I switched to claritin because I was having suicidal thoughts on singulair and I believe_ it raised my blood pressure as well.  I switched to ClaritinD to hopefully circumvent the suicidal thinking--even though it's not for asthma like the singulair.   I knew after a week I couldn't continue to take it.  Finding out it affected my blood pressure was an aside. My blood pressure_ which was normally very low was sky high on both singulair and claritin. It may be the decongestants in both_ but my blood pressure was very affected by both.I switched to allegra (generic) and nasonex--both drugs my mother takes.  So far_ so good. There's obviously a genetic link.  What worked for her_ has worked for me. And it's much less expensive than the singulair or veramyst or claritin that I was taking. And much less worrisome.  And I sleep.  Finally.  I do think some people can take some drugs better than others.  You have to do your h,,F,52,1  weeks,9/26/2008,Claritin

Since June I have been plagued with severe abdominal cramping (to the point where physicians were certain my appendix had ruptured only to find out nothing was wrong with it after a CAT scan).  In addition I have felt an un-nerving sense of anxiety_ inability to focus_ unable to ""let things go"" as well as continual fatigue. I am used to minimal sleep with small children....but now I could get 8 hours of sleep and wake up needing a nap within a couple hours! My get-up-and-go simply got-up-and-went!  I also have noticed periods of feeling intensely hot.  I begin to sweat profusely to the point where I want to change my clothes.

My sex drive has further decreased drastically too. in addition_ simple motivation like going to the gym for daily workout is gone and I haven't gone all week. Lastly_ I'm feeling sleepy all throughout the day - not too bad_ but just there like a mosquito by your ear. Just woke up to look up side effects for this b.c my nightmare took care of any rest for now.

Tried it twice with the same reaction both times.  Last year tried Claritin which we thought was great_ but she again suffered some anxiety.  She has a terrible peanut allergy and most worry was concentrated on food.  The anxiety went away_ so we did not put it together until we    tried Claritin again this year and she has been taking it steadily for a few weeks and for the last week & 1/2 we've had a TERRIBLE time with anxiety!!! I was getting very very worried_ but I am now convinced it is the Claritin and she will have no more EVER!  She even started to wash her hands a lot & has exhibited other OCD like behaviors.

These reactions were dramatic and never before experienced by her.  It took detective work to discover the connection with the medication. We are hopeful she will improve over time.  This has been a hideous_ needless experience.  Why after years of knowing of these severe side affects does the packaging not reflect the accurate side affects.  The CVS packaging had no warning whatsoever.  This truly seems criminal.,I can see no reason to have a child needlessly exposed to these side affects when other medications with less affect may be used.

512, 1, hayfever,My 5 yr old son took it from 5/6/08 to 5/17/08. About 8 days after taking it_ started to show signs of stuttering or stammering when talking...it got very severe very quickly to the point that he could not even say a sentence at all. It was not the same as a normal stutter that a child may have_ he even started to take deep breaths before and during speaking. One side effect of claritin in children is dysphonia which is a disorder that effect your vocal cords and has similar symptoms as a stutter. Only 2 percent of patients had this in a study that was conducted in children. The day after we took him off claritin_ the stuttering or stammering improved very much. Now it has been 12 days since taking it and he is almost talking normal again. Took him to his pediatrician  when it was still quite bad and they did not feel it was anything to worry about because they felt it was normal stuttering. However_ they did not get to hear how he sounded because he did not want to talk to the dr. Als,I realize there are many who have no side effects from this but I think it is pretty important for people to know this can happen. I had not idea that something like this could be a side effect from any drug let alone an over the counter drug for children. It just amazes me that this happened. It is also scary to me because I am sure there are others out there that have this side effect and it goes undetected because who would think it could be linked to something like claritin. I only checked into it because my husband said check the internet for side effects...in a almost jokingly way. Well no joke_ it happened to us. I now will not try anything else for my sons hayfever_ he is going to have to suffer because I am not willing to take any more chances like this.

530, 1, chronic sinusitus (most of my life),ANXIETY_ NERVOUSNESS_ INSOMNIA_ IRRITABILTY (started mild_ evolved into constant inner rage)_ DEPRESSION_ FEELINGS THAT NO ONE UNDERSTOOD ME_ LOW LIBIDO.  I am normally a happy_ smiling_ relaxed person who sleeps easily and laughs a lot.  I even laughed at drug commercials where the narrator rattles of a gazillion side effects.  Laugh no more!  On Claritin I was okay at first - a little anxious & nervous_ but no big deal.  It turned into constant anxiety_ a desire to bicker over every little thing_ anger at everyone & everything_ and waves of despondency.  I could only sleep a couple hours at a time_ but I was soooo tired I could barely stand it!  My poor husband_ I was a walking whackjob!  Plus_ I had no sex drive at all - Zero_ zilch!  After approx 1 month of taking Claritin daily_ I stopped.  It's been 10 days now_ and I feel back to my normal self.  I have my sinus problems again_ of course_ but that was expected.,Claritin is the only explanation I can find to why I felt and acted differently for that month timeframe.  For those people who think these side effects are simply imagined - I'm happy you are not experiencing what I did when I was on Claritin.,F,43,30  days,4/3/2008,Claritin
531, 2, allergies_ sensitivities,Bloating_ nausea_ indigestion_ and couldn't stop burping after every meal.  Side effect fever (100 degrees) and flu symptoms and throat infection.  I finally realized it was the Claritin and saw there are a lot of people with the same reactions listed here.  Allegra and Zyrtec worked better for me.,,F,41,8  months,4/2/2008,Claritin
532, 1, Allergys,VERY aggressive behavior! Sweating_ anxious.,I have a developmentally disabled son with severe speech apraxia_ he is usually a pretty even tempered boy of 14. After takeing Claritin for about 5 days he was sent to the nurse at school because he was soaking wet from sweat_ she took his BP & temp. which were normal_ she thought maybe low blood sugar so gave him juice. (he has never had low blood sugar before.)  She called me_ the only thing different I could think of was the Claritin. Funny thing is the box does not list any of the allergic reactions it might cause_ just to call your Dr. if you have any! The next morning he woke up being very aggressive and mean.  But sense he has verry little speech_ he can not tell me what is going on.  I quit giveing him Claritin and by the next day he was fine!  I will NEVER give this to him again!,M,14,5  days,3/31/2008Email,Claritin

534, 5, Hay fever w severe headaches,None - until I read this web site and discovered all the things I might blame on Claritin. Which aches_ pains and attributes of growing older to attribute to this? Unexplained foot pain is more likely from Lipitor..still checking that.,Ive been taking it daily during spring_ summer_ fall for 3 yrs...it is always allergy season here in swampy Washington DC. If I am late  starting in March_ it takes a few days to push back the headaches.And then it works wonders. Zyrtec for two days gave me the racing heart_ panic etc described in other posts here.,M,57,3  years,3/16/2008,Claritin

536, 3, Allergies,Urinary problems,I took Claritin from 1995-98 until I started having urinary problems and my doctor switched me to Allegra. After Allegra stopped working_ I went back on Claritin in late 2005. It's been the only OTC drug that's kept my allergy symptoms under control. However_ the urinary problems flare up after a few days or so of usage and Claritin/Loratadine is useless when I get hit by severe allergy attacks in the summer/fall months. I will probably switch to a new medication in the not too distant future.,M,26,2  years,3/11/2008,Claritin

538, 1, prescribed by doctor_ then OTC,nausea_ lack of appetite_ insomnia_ irritability_ depression prone.  Much worse with Caritan-D_ which made me hyperactive and annoying to my coworkers.,Allegra is better. Way better. Avoid psuedo-ephedrine unless you are stuffed up. People without allergies could care less how I reacted on medication_ so it affected by job performance and eventually my job reviews.,M,39, ,3/10/2008,Claritin

540, 3, Allergies. Stuffed nose_ itchy eyes,I was sitting at work_ having my lunch_ when I experienced heartburn (I never get hearburn).  All of a sudden I experienced what felt like a panic attack (heart racing_ out of body feeling_ dizzy).  Thought I was going to have to call the fire rescue.  Went away after a couple of minutes.  Very odd as I don't take it everyday_ only when my allergies become too bothersome_ and I usually have no side effects (been taking it occasionally for a couple of years).,,F,31,3  years,2/21/2008,Claritin

After taking for a few days_ bloating of face and abdomen_ gas.,"I first tried Claritin-D several years ago but stopped due to feeling foggy. I tried it again as an OTC beginning in October 2007 and after a week or so noticed I felt ""puffy."" I didn't seem to put on pounds but my clothes were definitly tighter and my face noticably bloated. I switched to Zyrtec this week (Feb 2008) and my face and abdomin went back to normal within about 48 hours. The change was drastic enough that my friends_family_ and co-workers noticed a difference immediately. Although Claritin-D did decrease my allergy symptoms_ the effectiveness was not worth the side effects. I am also concerned about the long term effects on my heart of a daily dose of 240mg of Pseudoephedrine sulfate. I have opted instead to use Zyrtec and take pseudoephedrine separately only as needed.",F,39,4  months,2/18/2008,Claritin

543, 1, hay fever and cat allergies,A few hours after taking my first 24hr dose I experienced  paranoia_ short temper_ jitters_ feelings of impending doom_ uncontrollable bad mood_ and even thoughts of suicide (not to mention chapped lips).  Prior to taking Claritin_ I never experienced these types of overwhelming negative feelings.  I'm back to my normal cheery self after getting off the stuff.,I only took two 24 hour doses of Claritin over two days_ and it had a major affect on my emotional stability and well-being.  I threw the bottle in the trash and will never touch the stuff again.,M,32,2  days,2/15/2008,Claritin
544, 4, Allergies,I never experienced any side effects with Claritin/Loratidine_ but I did find that Claritin D made my heart race_ which in turn made me very anxious (I hate pseudophedrine). Just plain Claritin has been great for my allergies.,Now that I've stopped taking Claritin_ I've been having anxiety attacks and insomnia. It only occurred to me today that these anxiety issues could be linked to discontinuance of a drug that sometimes makes other people sleepy (my boyfriend_ for instance).,F,35,4  years,2/1/2008,Claritin
545, 1, allergies,This medication was given to my 15 year old son to relieve allergy symptoms.  We didn't notice the effects until several months later.  He became mean and uncontrollable.  This is a medication that needs to be watched over carefully.  The corolation isn't direct so you don't even see it coming.  My 37 year old brother was affected the same way by Claritin.  After getting off the drug_ my son becaame the somewhat lovable teenager he was before this drug.  Take great care with children.,,F,46,60  days,1/17/2008Email,Claritin

Would subside in a few hours_ and then had pains in shoulder blades_ hips and other joints; lack of appetite; drowzy; unhealthy feeling",The Claritin did subside the allergic reaction I was having to the cleaning chemicals (swollen hands and feet); but by the 3rd day I was predicting the reaction.  My Dr. still doesn't think it's the Claritin that caused all of that.  I think if you naturally have a high resting heart rate (mine around 85-90)_ then Claritin will make your heart rate go through the roof!  Be careful.,F,37,6  days,12/11/2007,Claritin
547, 3, Seasonal and Indoor Allergies,Insomnia_ Anxiety_ Loss of Libido,After receiving an allergy test_ I found out why I had so many colds year round_ my doctor said to take Claritin and there were virtually no side effects.  After a month and a half I have no libido_ have trouble falling asleep (used to be in bed by 9pm or 10pm_ now its more 12am-2am... and up at 5am no matter what!)  The only change in the month that can be attributed to this is the claritin.  I used to take it occasionally_ and I started taking it once daily_ have never haad such problems before.  It worked ok for daily minimal exposures_ dust_ mold_ and pollen... but with contact to cats or dogs I needed to take both claritin and benadryl to be able to feel sufficient relief of symptoms.  I am stopping taking the medicine starting tomorrow_ as recommended by my doctor_ and am hoping the symptoms subside within a week (apparently these symptoms have been seen in small groups in clinical trials_ but theres only one way to find out for yourself).,F,23,1.5  months,12/10/2007,Claritin

551, 1, runny nose/allergy,Our 2 and a half year old son was prescribed liquid loratadine (5 mg once a day) by our GP.  After 3 days of taking this medicine my wife noticed he was quite cranky and aggressive during the day.  On the last night we gave him some of this he totally freaked out within 30 mins of having his dose.  Basically went totally out of control_ shouting aggressive fighting_ bright red_ absolutely beside himself running into the corner of any room he was in_ looking around everywhere_ saying there was something in his nappy_ ripping it off.  Very anxious.  He was so strong and uncontrollable.  Couldn't believe how worked up and red he was.  Fighting every attempt to calm him down.  Haven't seen anything like it.,Now a bit concerned about whether he should've been prescribed it and will be taking him to a new GP this week.  Will not be giving this to him again.,M,2,4  days,10/27/2007Email,Claritin

I woke up with a headache_ the chills_ no appetite_ feeling nauseous and like I might faint.  I've never taken it so close to bedtime_ so I think thats why I had such a bad reaction.,I also agree some of the other comments here that explain the high you feel on it_ but thats only if i take it in the afternoon or during the day. I will never take this again so close to bed time_ but will take it again earlier in the day for my congestion.,F,27,3  years,9/20/2007,Claritin

It cause my blood pressure to increase to a dangerous level and put my heart into arrythmia damaging the heart.,Does anyone know of a attorney taking on claritin clients? I am outraged about the damage to my heart and the lack of labeling on the box. Does anyone else have similar problems with this?

It worked great the first time I took it_ my cough was gone. But the second day my cough and post nasal drip were back_ but not as severe. I am glad that I found this website because I don't think the side effects are worth it_ and I am not going to continue to take it to see if they get worse.

I take it everyday_ otherwise_ my hands start to itch again (no idea why I have this problem_ but it has plagued me since I was very young - BEFORE claritin).  I used to have to take Hydroxyzine HCL_ which would knock me out.  Claritin has been a lifesaver - even better when it was changed to OTC.  It also helps minimize my seasonal allergies_ though not quite as good as benedril_ or something like that.  But who cares about not sneezing if you can't stay awake?,M,44,10  years,8/30/2007,Claritin
564, 5, Severe Allergy Symptoms,In 4 years of taking Claritin I haven't noticed any certain side effects.  I've been looking to see if anyone using claritin regularly for this long has experienced a loss of the sense of smell which began this year.  I've also had some dryness issues that began this year only.  I've been off of the claritin a week now and neither of these symptoms have gone away and I am more dehydrated.  Other than the severe dehydration I haven't noticed anything like withdrawal symptoms either.  I'm not sure if my loss of ability to smell is related to the claritin or not.,Claritin has been a life saver for me.  I had severe itching_ watery eyes_ sneezing_ sometimes hives and claritin would clear all of this up with the possible exception of the very peak of the allergy season.  Then some nights I would supplement with benedryl.  I never had any side effects that I have noticed until perhaps this year.,M,43,4  years,8/26/2007Email,Claritin

After I ran out of Allegra_ I bought Claritin_ and it has worked much better than Allegra thus far. Cats don't bother me_ and outdoor allergies are much less intense_ if they act up at all. I suppose it depends on the person which is better. Good Claritin experience thus far.,M,33,5  days,8/24/2007,Claritin

My father also showed short term memory loss on Claritin (took a long time to convince him he was having the problem - he kept forgetting we had the conversation).,"Took Claritin for a couple years before we realized what was going on.  My husband would tell me something_ and a few minutes (or days) later_ I would snap at him for something I could swear he didn't tell me (but he had.  We would actually argue about ""you didn't tell me that"" scenarios all the time.  We finally read the side effect insert and it shows short term memory loss as a known side effect.  It sounds funny_ but was very frustrating to argue with my husband because of a drug!  It was very eye opening after I went off it to watch my Father_ who was still on it.  I got to see what my husband saw when I was on it.",F,39,2  years,8/15/2007,Claritin
568, 5, Meniere's Disease and Allergies,None,This drug works so well to keep my allergies under control_ which thus keeps the dizziness caused by Meniere's under control.  I am not sure it lasts the full 24 hours for me (sometimes I have to take another dose at 18 to 22 hours_ which my doctor says is ok).  I do NOT take Claritin with decongestant_ as the doctor said it would make the ringing in my ears worse.  After a recent bout of Menieres (dizziness_ ear pain_ ringing_ etc.) I made the mistake of going off the Claritin and taking Antivert only_ which prolonged the Meniere's symptoms after the initial severe dizziness.  My ears were really bothering me_ the ringing was terrible_ and my balance was awful.  On the doctor's advice_ I stopped the Antivert and went back on Claritin. I felt better immediately.  Other antihistamines I've taken in the past make me too drowsy_ cause too many side effects_ and wear off in a few hours.  Claritin has made a big difference for me and I plan to keep taking it.,F,56,3  years,8/14/2007,Claritin

570, 4, hives_ seasonal allergies,Rapid heart rate_ jittery_ sweaty_ thirsty_ kind of dizzy. Only noticed symptoms by hour 12_ before that no symptoms at all.,This really helped my allergies. My hives were really bad and this kept it under control. I wasn't sneezing anymore and all my other symptoms were gone. I took claritin in the morning at about 8am every day and by 8pm I was majorly wired. It reminded me of when I used to take mini thins and drank triple shot mochas. I felt really energetic but jittery. I also was really thirsty about 12 hours after taking it. I was breastfeeding and didn't notice too much of an effect on my baby. She seemed to be sleeping just fine. Maybe a little bit less than usual. You can certainly tell that you've taken the medicine. The side effects were pretty obvious for me. I was fine until about 12 hours into it. I would not recommend this to those who are sensitive to caffeine or have bad reactions to diet pills. This makes you feel like you've been drinking coffee all day and maybe a few lines of coke with it. WOW- great for allergies_ though.,F,25,10  days,7/19/2007,Claritin

But then I stopped for a while and felt better again_ but then my allergies returned and I took claritin again_ so the symptoms came back. Then I came to this website and read about the symptoms other people had_ so it occurred to me that this medication was the culprit. I'll never take claritin again.,M,18,1  months,7/13/2007,Claritin
572, 2, allergies,Jitters_ light headedness and slight blurred vision. I felt as though some thing was squezzing on my head causing my vision to become blurry almost to the point of double vision. It does not relieve the vast majority of my symptoms and does nothing for the extreme headaches I get from my allergy attacks. I used to take this regularly but stopped because I need the decongestant and pain relief. A doctor recommended I try again and this reminded me of why I stopped the first time.,As with all drugs check out the side effects before you start. Some are not worth the pain. I was recommended to put my son on this but after reading the reviews I will not.

The congestion moved up into my sinuses_ rather than expressing as post-nasal drip.,F,43,4  days,6/27/2007,Claritin
574, 5, seasonal allergies,None.,This really works for me.  It eliminates anywhere from 75-95% of my symptoms.  Usually between mid-May and early July I have allergies that produce very itchy eyes_ sneezing_ itching in my mouth and throat and ears_ sneezing_ and severe congestion.  Claritin eliminates the vast majority of that stuff.  It takes a few days to start working though.  When I start it in any given year_ I have to take it 4 or 5 days before it clears up the allergies.  The generic seems to work fine too.,F,50,45  days,6/24/2007,Claritin

It cleared my allergies but I had stomach aches and diarrhea every day I took Claritin. My joints started hurting as well (could be from dehydration) Almost went to the doctor (I never go) but thought about it and remembered I had been taking Claritin instead of Drixoral. I stopped taking it and 24hrs later all the symptoms went away... Next time I'll pay closer attention when trying a new medication,M,24,5  days,6/22/2007,Claritin

Possible slight drowsiness (or slight loss of mental focus) and some loss of libido_ but no erectile problems. Overall_ the benefits of being able to function without sneezing and suffering from weeping eyes outweigh the side-effects for me.,I used an unbranded 10mg Loratadine_ but have also used Claritin (without decongestant) which is the same. I've been taking it for 3 years in the summer months now without serious problems. I wouldn't personally give this to my children (under 10) without first seeking medical advice and I would look out for any signs of altered behaviour. Increased vitamin C consumption had no impact on hayfever symptoms for me and I've found no other effective relief.,M,36,3  years,6/18/2007,Claritin
580, 4, Allergies,Anxiety_ jitteryness,I had been taking Claritin daily to relieve seasonal allergies for 4 or 5 years without any apparent problems.  Then in the last 8 to 10 months_ I started having problems with anxiety and jitters. I thought I was having heart palpitations as often my body felt as though it was vibrating_ especially first thing after waking up in the morning.  My wife is a cardiac RN so I asked her to listen to my heart and she found no problems.  After reading about other people's symptoms on this web site_ I stop taking Claritin two days ago and so far_ anxiety and jitters have gone away.,M,42,5  years,6/16/2007,Claritin
581, 3, Allergies,Bloating_ Slight Constipation,Unlike other OTC pills for congestion_ I did NOT feel like I was on drugs when on Claritin.  I really dont feel anything but it does help me with the dizziness I feel when I get congested from allergies.  I do not feel speedy or drowsy_ but I do feel bloated.  I think it works but I cant tell how much.,F,33,9  days,6/11/2007,Claritin

However_ it made me extremely sleepy.Glad I took it over a weekend_ I could not stay awake.quit taking it after 2 days_ and eventually the sleepynesssubsided.,Great for allergies_ But I wouldnt take it again_ due to the sleepyness it caused,M,68,2  days,6/10/2007,Claritin
583, 1, seasonal allergies,Extreme anxiety.  A constant feeling of impending doom.  Makes me want to sleep_ but sleep has been horrible--sweaty and restless.  Body aches all over_ especially back_ shoulder_ elbow_ knee.  Heart racing_ inability to focus on anything_ lower libido.   I'm glad I found this site with all the support.  No more Claritin!,Get rid of this stuff!  The absolute worst experience I've ever had with medication.  I will never use it again.  Somewhat controls allergies_ but side effects far_ far outweigh the benefits.,M,30,10  days,6/8/2007,Claritin
584, 3, constant congestion_ bad allergies,anxiety. spaciness. sleeplessness_ and when i did sleep my dreams were vivid yet frightening at times. the dreams tended to portray unfavorable or eerie -- yet for the most part irrational and impractical every time. but they were always bad enough that i just had to wake up from them stay awake for a while while i grounded myself back onto reality.,the pollen this year was obscene_ so i started taking it. after about 3-5 days_ the allergies were about 75% better. that's also where the side effects kicked in. like a previous poster_ it seemed that come the tail end of the 24-hour cycle_ allergies would be in high gear again. side effects were noticeable after 5 days. will be quitting soon.,M,22,7  days,6/6/2007,Claritin

I called the company. They told me that ""no one ever reports the symptoms you mentioned at all_ especially not the regular non-D formula... of course a few -- very few -- people report some of the symptoms you mention on the D formula_ but this one is news to me."" In other words_ the company played dumb and told me the drug is extremely safe. I do NOT have a history of depression nor anxiety; I do NOT take any other medications; I don't drink_ smoke nor take drugs; I am fit_ healthy and eat a good diet. Claritin has had powerful negative effects on my body and there is no other explanation than that the drug has caused these effects. I'll bet this drug will be taken off the market in the future and found to be dangerous. I especially would not recommend giving it to children.",F,40,2  days,6/6/2007,Claritin
586, 1, seasonal allergies,My 3yr old started to become very angry and aggressive.  In our nursery he never had a problem even when someone else treated him bad.

I normally have rheumetoid arthritis which effects the joints in my wrists and knuckles.  It has been completely gone since taking this medication.  So I guess that's a plus.,It works well to treat allergies.  It takes your body a few days to adjust.  For the first few days_ I felt really strange and jittery_ but then that went away.  I could feel allergy symptoms returning at about 23 hours.  It does make you tired.  I have to take it right before bed--the first 8 hours are most drowsy.  I am enjoying the good sleep it provides.  I still get tired during the day though.  I am enjoying the vivid dreams.  They are intricate and easy to remember in the morning. I think I'll miss them when I stop the drug in a few weeks. I went to the Claritin site and could find nothing on side effects.  I am concerned about long term use.,F,47,35  days,6/5/2007,Claritin

These symptoms were not clearly evident until my son was on the medicine for about 2 months.,Son can not tolerate Singular either.  Same kinds of symptoms_ esp the stomach pains and reflux.

I saw the pediatrician today - and complained about this - he said - ""any drug like this can give these side effects"" well_ I wish I would have known.  Runny nose is better than violent child.  Wrote to Claritin - they want me to call their ""report"" line and report these symptoms.",M,3,6  months,5/31/2007Email,Claritin
591, 3, seasonal allergies,EXTREME HEADACHES,Worked like a charm for itchy palate_ runny nose_ itchy eyes.  I didn't realize that the Claritin was the culprit for my headaches until I had to stop taking it so I could re-test for my allergies.  I experienced a week of not headaches and now I won't take the stuff again_ no matter how well it worked.,F,32,2  years,5/29/2007,Claritin
592, 3, Seasonal Allergies,Some mild side effects - felt tired_ occasional fogginess_ definite digestive side effects including slight heartburn.  I did feel like it effected my mood_ definite decrease of interest emotionally.  However_ I started taking claritin because this season seemed to be the worst I ever felt it.  I don't normally take anything but my allergies were to the point of not being able to function.  I have taken Benadryl before and it just straight knocks me out.(great for a good night sleep)  I tried Claritin and it didn't seem to do much the first day.  I heard that it might take a few days to effect your system so I kept taking it.  I would say I started feeling the allergies go away after day 3.  I ran out after day 5 and the next morning felt the allergies come back.,I would say give it a try if your allergies are really bad.  Just make sure to watch out for side effects.  Also I have been taking vitamin c_ supposedly a natural remedy for allergies.  FYI I did have dry lips and hoarseness before I took any medicine_ I think its a side effect of severe post nasal drip.,F,29,5  days,5/26/2007,Claritin

Although I was sleepy_ the drugged out feeling definitely reminded me of a bad recreational drug experience (like dirty meth). I would absolutely not recommend this for anyone unless their allergies are making them miserable enough that they don't mind feeling like they are on a bad drug trip.,M,33,2  days,5/26/2007,Claritin
594, 1, The Worst Allergies Of My Life,Bloating_ Nausea_ Lethargy_ Depression_ Mood Swings_ Eye Flutters/Vision Problems_ Insomnia_ Dry Mouth_ Dizzyness.,"This spring I had the worst allergies I have ever had in my life. My doctor recommended Claritin-D and I bought and used the 24-hour pill. I didn't think that I could feel any worse but boy was I wrong. After a ""high"" not unlike cocaine or meth_ I proceeded to be plagued by symptoms very much analogous to coming down off the previously mentioned narcotics. These symptoms lasted a full 16 hours_ and were much_ much worse than my allergies. Really psychologically devastating. Additionally_ as a recovering alcoholic_ I highly recommend that anyone recovering from alcohol or drug addiction avoid this drug entirely. I have been sober for three years and this took me back to the first 48 hours of quitting booze cold turkey: I was sweating_ shaking_ had very poor balance_ and experienced the same dystopia I had when I had kicked alcohol. Anyone who's recovering will know what I mean_ and unless you want to go through that hell all over_ stay away from this little white pill. ",M,31,1  days,5/25/2007,Claritin
595, 3, Seasonal Allergies,I started taking Claritin sometime last Spring and got some major bloating and such at the same time. I assumed it was stress from taking finals_ and didn't have to stay on it long because whatever I was allergic to died off in the heat. NOW_ 1 year later I've been taking Claritin again. I have no tests now_ so I know this time it isn't stress!!! Claritin has caused me EXTREME bloating and abdominal discomfort and maybe weight gain to the point where I'm getting stretch marks on my stomach! It's totally ridiculous_ and the appearance of my stretch marks perfectly coincides w/ my claritin use. I also at times get bizarre feelings in my chest...and when coupled w/ coffee (which usually does little for me unless I do exercise) gives me heart palipitations and feeling of insane jitteryness. Potentially also related is a new found feeling of muscle tenseness and insane dreams.,I am never taking this stuff again. I'd rather just wait 2 weeks until it gets hot enough that my allergens die off. They say non-drowsy which is complete B.S. I've never wanted to sleep more in my life. Goodbye Claritin_ I wont miss you a bit.,M,21,4  weeks,5/22/2007,Claritin
596, 1, my childs allergies,I have a 6 year old that was taking Claritin for just under a week. He started developing cracked_ bleeding lips_ bloody nose_ extreme anxiety. We actually went to the doctors to check on these symptoms. I was horrified that the doctor after reading these side effects never related it to the drugs already subscribed. She subsribed more drugs and later an allergist. After my husband found this website we took him off the Claratin immediately. His lips are healing but his nose is taking longer. His behavior is slowly coming back to the sweet_ bright child we had before. He is really struggling. How could this drug not be including these side effects!! This is horrible and irresponsible!,,F,47,7  days,5/21/2007,Claritin

In fact_ I work in a health clinic as an RN and have never spoken to anyone who has had side effects from this medication so I was amazed at all the side effects reported here.,It works very well controlling sneezing_ itchy eyes_ nose and throat.

600, 2, allergies,Both my 17 yr old daughter & I took claritin for allergies & allergy induced headaches.  Shortly thereafter we both had extreme muscle pain.  Her headaches actually got worse and she was unable to walk due to the headache and severe muscle pain.  I however was only thirsty with muscle pain.  It did however stop my post nasal drip which caused many asthma attacks.  I only use this very cautiously now only when the benefits can outweigh the side effects.,,F,39,5  weeks,5/17/2007,Claritin
601, 1, seasonal allergies,Claritin worked for my allergies but was not worth the side effects.  My ringing ears was the first thing I noticed.  Then I became very drowsy/sleepy.  I also felt faint every now and then.  But the worst symptom was the severe depression/anxiety that happened just hours after I took the first (and only) dose.  I felt like I was just going to lose it.  I also kept snapping at my kids.  It was weird and I'll never take claritin again!!!!!!!!,,F,35,1  days,5/16/2007,Claritin

After I took pain killer I would feel better but I didn't feel it's right. I only occasionly have headache which mostly due to catch a cold and my blood pressure is always normal. But this time_ it seems that there is no reason for me to have headaches. Clartin does help stopping sneezing. I felt good without sneezing but then felt very bad about my  headache. One of my doc friend said it could be the side effects of the antihistamine medication b/c it stops the secreation of the mucous and then it might lead to increase sinus pressure as well. Whatever_ I will stop taking the medication for several days and see how will my headache be.,,F,30,15  days,5/14/2007Email,Claritin
604, 2, seasonal allergies,Given to my 8yr old son who ended up having very badly chapped lips (dry and cracked_ painful) and he sounded as if he had a sore throat.  He told me he did not but it was very evident that he was loseing his voice!  And lots of coughing.  I took him off of it and his voice came back the next day_.coughing has stopped and the lips are cleared up also.  But we are back to the sneezeing so I will put him back on his old zyrtec.  I thought this would be better being a non-drowsy antihistimine_.not for us_.he had a hard time getting to bed at night also.,This product did work as far as clearing up his puffy eyes_.and stopping his sneezeing.,F,40, ,5/14/2007,Claritin
605, 1, allergies,I took a 24 hr pill this morning at work (about 11am). I already had a sinus headache to start with. within an hour or so I started to notice I felt dizzy. The headache got worse_ the dizziness got worse_ my vision was blurry and then I got serve tunnel vision. I couldn't focus on anything or anyone. Felt nausea_ but never threw up. I felt EXTREME anxiety! I also had some chest pain that made it hard for me to breathe. The tunnel/blurred vision and dizziness made it impossible for me to even sit up straight. I ended up having to be walked out and driven home. I drank chamomile tea and fell asleep. When I would wake up and roll over I felt like I was in a water bed or some kind of wave. The serve dizziness and extreme anxiety lasted all day and into the evening (8:30pm). This was a horrible and scary experience.,I will NEVER use this product again.,F,26,1  days,5/13/2007,Claritin

I was always thirsty_ major headache and was having a hard time being cordial to anyone.,This drug_ I was told was a cure for constant congestion_ was the worst decision ever.  My congestion was only helped on a minor scale_ I wanted to throw up all the time.  I could not taste anything_ after two bites I would get sick.  I felt moody_ my body hurt_ and my head was pounding.  There is NO INFORMATION OF SIDE EFFECTS anywhere_ leading me to believe it is a deliberate attempt to missinform the public.

I always drink lots of water so i never noticed the dry mouth or constant thirst feeling. Definitely more irritable.,This stuff works..i have absolutely no symptoms of my allergies_ im mean nothing_ no runny or congested sinuses_ no sneezing_ no teary or itchy eyes_ nothing i thought it was a miracle drug until i started realizing the side effects and how it was affecting my life and overall attitude.

Hip/leg pain that wakes me several times a night. Inability to get a good night's rest.,I'm hoping that the hair loss will reverse once the buildup of this med is out of my system. I can't bear to think what would have happened if I were taking the 24-hr tablet vs. one 12-hr tablet per day.,F,43,1  months,3/28/2007,Claritin
634, 1, Allergies,Something like a yeast infection but not quite_ all the itching and sores and some discharage.  This drug made me really thirsty_ sore muscles_ my teeth hurt really bad_ nauseated_ relentless thirst_ diarhea and fatigue.  For all the horrible things it did to my body_ it never helped my allergies at all. When I first started taking these I didn't realize it was the drug causeing all of these problems.  I quit taking them for about a week_ everything cleared up_ it didn't dawn on me unitl I started taking it again and all this misery returened that it was the drug.,The stuff did nothing for me except wreak havoc on my body,F,40,2  months,3/26/2007,Claritin
635, 1, sneezing_ congestion_ runny nose,Twitching of the eyes and nose areas--like a REALLY BAD nervous habit--it became very noticable to everyone and it was embarassing to me. Irritability_ increased anxiety_ and needing more sleep. Instead of my usual 8 hours a day I started sleeping 10 or 11 hours a day.,I'm currently taking zoloft. Claritin counteracted the good effects of my zoloft medication. I hate what claritin did to me!!,M,26,3  weeks,3/25/2007,Claritin
636, 1, seasonal allergies,I felt extreme lethargy shortly after starting on this drug and have just now found the connection.  I also am sweating an abnormally large amount.  I sleep for an average of 10.5 hours a night since i started and previously it was more like 7.  I also experienced a loss of appetite.,I gave up two of my hobbies and stopped going to church within a week of starting this drug for no real reason.  I felt like nothing mattered anymore and everything seemed like i was in a dream. I have become very inactive since i started this drug and am planning  to stop taking immediately.,M,17,2  weeks,3/25/2007,Claritin
637, 1, nasal allergies,Serious_ debilitating depression which came on after the 3rd day on Claritin_ and disappeared about 2 days after I stopped taking it.  I've never been depressed before but on Claritin_I could barely get out of bed.  Deep_ grinding muscle aches in the back and neck.  I felt as if I was coming down with a bad_ bad flu.,There was no warning about the depression or muscle pain on the box.  I thought I was losing my mind until I found this website. It was quite frightening.,F,46,5  days,3/22/2007,Claritin

639, 2, cat allergies,Im pregnany and my doctor told me to take it while on a trip. I was having very bad bladder spasms_ tingling sensation_ and frequent urination. It was very very uncomfortable_ and I dont get any sleep from it. It worked great on my allergies. no other side effects.,Expensive allergy pill for all the side effects people were having_ and they need to put warning about using with heart problems more avalible.,F,22,2  days,3/19/2007Email,Claritin

641, 1, Seasonal Allergies,Severe abdominal cramping.  Loss of appetite.,I began to take the OTC version shortly after my Allegra prescription ran out.  Since I was using it while camping I thought it was food poisoning or possibly some bad water.At the time I asked my doctor about side effects and he didnt mention severe cramping as one.  I didnt realize it was the drug until after 2 other times using it.Im now happily back on Allegra with the only side effect for me being increased alertness.,M,29,2  days,3/16/2007,Claritin
642, 1, Seasonal Allergies,After a couple of days on the 24 hour version_ I started getting migraines_ and I never had them before.  Tylenol & Ibuprofen  would barely take the edge off.  By the third day and third Migraine I realized that this could be caused by the claritin.  As soon as I went off the med_ the Migraine went away.,I switched back to good old Benadryl_ yeah it makes you tired at first_ but after a few days you body adapts to it.,M,39,4  days,3/14/2007Email,Claritin
643, 2, seasonal and cat allergies,I've been on Claritin (the 24-hour pill) for about five days and it seems to help with some allergy symptoms_ but I don't like the side effects. Fifteen minutes after taking it I get an anxious feeling (bordering on panic). I seem to breathe OK_ so I imagine my blood pressure is spiking up. I am super bloated and constipated. I also have sharp stomach pains after eating. Last night_ I had a weird weak feeling like I was coming down with something bad. That feeling sorta comes and goes mixed with a nervous edginess. My husband said I seemed suddenly mad at him for no reason the other night and looking back_ he was right. I was very cranky and on edge. I seem to sleep OK on the stuff so far_ although I am worried about developing some of the other side effects I've read about on this site.,In past years_ I've been on Claritin for short periods (mostly for cat allergy). It did nothing for my itchy eyes or throat_ but it relieved some sneezing and was basically non-drowsy. I do remember feeling depressed on it_ but I figured I was just bummed out by the allergies. I decided to try Claritin again this week because I have severe spring allergies and the medication is available without a prescription. I've now decided I don't like the side effects of anxiety_ flu-like fatigue_ and digestive problems. I think Benadryl works better on the allergy symptoms_ although it makes me sleepy. I am going to try taking it at night and maybe try Sudafed and allergy eye drops during the day. It's going to be tough_ but the Claritin just makes me feel too weird and I can't afford to develop insomnia because of my busy life.,F,40,5  days,3/10/2007,Claritin
644, 4, Indoor mold/mildew allergies,Took Claritin (24-hr); developed ringing in the ears_ unexpected (and totally unwanted) weight gain_ constantly FREEZING_ went from needing 7.5-8hrs of sleep/night to at least 10hrs_ and some days I would be very mellow and unmotivated_ other days totally wired and jittery.,Claritin really helped my mold/mildew allergy symptoms (dark circles under eyes_ puffy cheeks_ nasty headaches).  But_ the side effect showed up so strongly after only 7 days of taking Claritin every day_ that I've stopped taking it.  My MD has now switched me to Allegra.,F,40,7  days,3/5/2007,Claritin

647, 1, post-nasal drip,Insomnia_ difficulty breathing_ palpitations_ chest tightness_ extreme fatigue_ dazed feeling_ joint pain_ anger and irritability.,It did not cure my postnasal condition_ although it has helped with allergies to various pollens.

651, 1, Year round allergies,This is a terrible medicine. My nine year old has been taking this for over a year and his behavior at times  has been out of control. We did not make the connection to Claritin until recently when my pediatrican suggested taking him off the medication to see if it made a difference in the behavior. The change was radical.  Doctors should warn parents about these emotional/behavioral side effects before prescribing this medication to children.,,M,9,1  years,1/16/2007,Claritin
652, 4, Nasal congestion due to cold,Dryness in the mouth but most importantly having difficulty urinating.,Claritin D 24 hour pill works well as decongestion.

But apparently it restricted other vessels in the body.,M,56,2  days,1/5/2007Email,Claritin

I used to take it years ago and don't remember having such crazy psychological side effects. I have only been on it for five days and today was the worst. I ran out of my family's christmas party crying and drove away. I felt like I was going crazy. When I came home_ I got online and started researching the side-effects. I'm glad I came to this site.

I was freaking out about everything.  I talked to a friend and I hinted that maybe it was claritin.  He sent me this link and now I'm convinced that I was experiencing the worst of the side effects of Clariton.  I am off of it today and already feel less anxiety.

662, 5, Sneezing_ general mild allergies,Loratadine has been a god-send_ as far as alleviating my allergy symptoms.  It_ of course_ does leave me with a dry mouth/throat.  The unusual thing I have noticed is that my allergies are horrible if I forget to take my pill in the morning - regardless of the time of year.  If I go a few days without taking it_ I can hardly function.  My allergies were pretty mild before taking Loratadine.  My fear is that beginning my daily regimen I have opened Pandora's Box and will now be forced to continue until I die.,I would like to see more long-term research on Claritin/Loratadine.

Everything became a big deal to me and I even started to become paranoid about others.,Works on allergic symptoms very well_ and I still occasionally take it for a day or two.

Thank god we found this website.  My son became out of control.  He threw things_ hit and kicked us.  He was removed from his daycare because of the behavior.

No more Claritin for me!!!,It worked great for the allergies that I've experienced this spring--I'm guessing they've occurred as a combination of something the chemo did and moving two years ago from the Midwest to the South--different plants_ etc.  Side effects just not worth it though.,F,51,6  weeks,6/13/2006,Claritin

716, 3, year-round allergies,No side effects for about 3 years.  In the last few months of taking it_ suddenly side effects of all sorts started appearing. I experienced severe anxiety (feeling on edge all of the time)_ sleep disruption (waking up at 3am for weeks)_ anger (very short temper possibly due in part to the poor sleep)_ high blood pressure/racing heartbeat_ severe chills_ all of which resolved after stopping Claritin/Loraditine (generic).,Since stopping Claritin/Loraditine_ my side effects resolved_ however I had some severe itching for days after stopping it_ with red blotches all over that would come and go.  It felt like my histamine receptors were overreacting to allergens.  I had moderate to severe congestion for the first couple weeks after stopping the drug as well_ which now clears as the day progresses.  The anxiety from Claritin/Loratidine caused me to grind my teeth_  which led to jaw fatigue which is finally resolving...weeks later.This drug worked great for years_ until just about every side effect in the book afflicted me.

I took my last dose last evening and I wont take anything again. I had only been taking these medications for about 3 days. My hands are cold and clamy and I just can't wait for the crap to get out of my system completely so I can at least feel mentally stable again. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!! I even called a psychiatrist and made an appt just to get a quick pill to kill the panic. I use to have panic attacks when I was a teenager and young adult.

720, 2, allergies,I have suffered from depression and anxiety for 25 years.  I began taking Claritin eight months ago.  It worked great in terms of relieving my allergy symptoms_ but made the depression a lot worse.  I didn't realize the Claritin was making me worse -- just thought the depression was getting worse on its own.  But the depression I have experienced became more and more frequent and severe.  After reading about similar experience from others_ I am pretty certain it's the Claritin causing it.  I have had similar reactions to other medicines_ like steroids_ but with the steroids_ it happened a lot faster so I was able to make the connection.

735, 1, Dust allergies in toddler,"My then two and a half-year old daughter started taking Claritin at bedtime on the advice of her allergist.  It took me more than a year to realize that her irritability_ temper tantrums_ emotional fraility_ and inability to sleep through the night were related to the drug.  Her pre-school teacher noticed a huge change in her just days after we went off it (we hadn't told the teacher we took her off)_ and mentioned how she seemed to suddenly ""come out of her shell"" and was more ""mature.""  Also that she has new friends.  All this in one week!  When we told the teacher about taking our daughter off the drug_ she was floored.  Now two weeks later_ my daughter_ who wouldn't talk about school_ communicates about the day's activities and is so much more friendly_ happy and interested in life.  One week after coming off it she is sleeping 11-12 hours without waking up for the first time in years.  I will never put my daughter back on this drug.  The change has been dramati","As a parent_ I recommend against putting children on this drug.  They are too young to know what a side effect might be and how to explain it.  And it's hard to discern between ""normal"" kid behavior and side effects (I attributed way too much to ""terrible twos."")  Our doctor gave us no warning about 10mg being too much for a toddler.  The lack of sleep spiraled into bad day after bad day.  We are now exploring some of the homeopathic remedies_ on the advice of her pediatrician.  Our work on the environment (floors_ mattresses_ pillows_ etc.) has made a huge difference in her dust allergies and we won't go back to Claritin_ Singulair or Zyrtec.  Singulair and Zyrtec noticeably changed her personality_ Claritin took me longer to figure out.

745, 1, Seasonal allergies,I experienced a racing_ pounding heartbeat_ constant ringing in the ears_ but the worst part was the ANGER!  I described it to my husband as wanting to really HURT someone_ anyone_ for no apparent reason!  Having small children_ it was an extremely frightening experience_ because I felt as if I could lash out at them at any time with little or no provocation.  I also experienced irritability and restlessness but at the same time I was fatigued.  Very vivid_ confused dreams.,Claritin took the edge off of my allergies_ it stopped the sneezing fits and kept my nose from running so much... but the side effects were not worth the small amount of relief.,F,37,4  days,9/11/2005,Claritin

747, 1, Major allergies,I was prescribed 10 mg Claritin daily_ which I took for 3.5 years.   I gained 50 lbs_ yes_ fifty pounds in 2 years!  Never having had a weight problem_ I went to several doctors to find out why this had happened.  Most told me I was crazy.  Think about it: going from 118 pounds to 170 pounds in 2 years!!!! Who wouldn't freak out? I took myself off Claritin and within five days I had lost 7 pounds.  It is two years later and I have lost 20 of those 50 pounds_ but now my thyroid function is extremely low_ and I have to take drugs for this condition.  I blame the Claritin for my thyroid problems because I never had any thyroid abnormalities before I began using the drug loratadine.,Please force your physician to get to the bottom of the problem if you have experienced similar abnormal weight gain in a short period of time.  I do not think anyone should take medications for which there have been no long term usage studies performed_ which is the case with Claritin---the longest time period in its clinical trial was 6 months.,F,45,3.5  years,8/19/2005,Claritin

The only symptom I had though was post-nasal drip. After two weeks of Claritin_ I found this website and realized I wasn't pregnant_ wasn't suicidal and did not suddenly have IBS.

I have noticed this pattern for a couple of years now.  Very recently I got so bad that I was sneezing 10 times in a row_ had extremely red and itchy eyes_ etc.  Wearing a dust mask and stopping Claritin helped immensely.

Sometimes I feel weak and minor sleep disruptions,It gets the job done though_ minimizes the symptoms of allergies.  I am trying the local honey therapy (taking 2 teaspoons per day of local raw honey). If that works I will get off this medication since others seem to have similar if not more problems. I tried a generic allergy medication from HyVee and that made me extremely nauseous!,M,30,2  years,6/2/2005,Claritin

As the pill is wearing off_ I'm getting back my raspy voice that I had before taking the medication (a raspy voice is better than nothing!).

I thought about it and realized that it might be a side effect and stopped taking it.,I usually will start taking a generic claritin around the end of April thruout May. I don't think I ever experienced the intense side effects as I have this season. The pills I was taking expire in two months_ perhaps that contributed to it.

Claritin helps with the major symptoms and generally makes me feel more comfortable_ so as I can sleep and function without being miserable. On a scale of 1 to 10_ I'd say it helps my symptoms about a 7. Not perfect_ but helps considerably. If I take one every 24 hours_ I get different side effects: sore throat (bad)_ sore back muscles (somewhat bad_ have to stop exercising)_ and being tired (not so bad). If I take one every other day_ then I have no side effects.,M,36,5  weeks,4/20/2005,Claritin

I went to school to check in on him and take his lunch when his teacher asked me if he was OK?That he was not doing his school work_ he didn't care about school work and that he acted like he didn't hear a word she was saying.

I stopped taking it for 10 days last month when I visited relatives and slept like a baby.  Since then_ every single night I have woken up after 3-4 hours of sleep and could not get back to sleep easily (even when thoroughly exhausted).  Also_ this occasional irregular/ increased heart beat I've been experiencing has made me very nervous about continuing this drug.

Some of my side effects with Claritin include: impotence_ insomnia_ very bad mood swings - had really knocked down one of my friends and I didn't know why i had such a bad temper but now I beleive it was this drug. I rarely get upset - I am that type of person. Also_ I had been 7 months into working out in the gym and 2 weeks into taking claritin I started feeling a lot of pain in my legs and arms. I don't recommend allergy drugs - just take natural remedies (honey_ exercise_ fruits_ and vegetables). I have been eating 2 fruits a day (banana_ pear_ apple) and  so far have not had any allergies.

Sure_ it helped my allergy feeling go away_ but not any better that Benadryl_ and Bendaryl doesn't make me so miserable. I already have an anxiety disorder_ I didn't need this on top of it. If I'd gone into a full panic attack because of Claritin_ I'd have gone to the hospital_ as the symptoms were so severe. Because a full attack didn't happen_ I felt that I should wait and see_ and once it was out of my system_ I felt better.,M,22,1  days,11/22/2004,Claritin

It does seem to Intensify some depression_ anger_ sever gas pains and sleep patterns. However_ latley I seem to be having alot of dicomfort which I have not experianced before. I read that one side affect of long term users may be vaginitis! In the last two months I have felt this dicomfort I may be making a second trip to the docs! I will have to see if claritin is to blame.,Even with the symptoms I describe claritin has helped greatly. I moved to 3 diffrent states in 4 years and do believe that has played a role in my already horriable allergy to dust dander and pollen. It seemed that the last state we moved to was the worst. A red scaley rash appeared on my face around nose and mouth then as I was taking a med to help clear that up I started waking up covered in hives!! all over my back_ lips_ arms_ butt and legs. Finally my doc said I had severely sensitive skin said to keep away from anything that wasnt hypo-allergenic and dermatoligist tested then put me on claritin onece a night before bed. No more hives or reaccurance on the rash and I have a cat that doesnt make me sneeze!!! I will be said if this becomes something I can no longer take.,F,26,1  years,11/21/2004Email,Claritin
806, 1, to help unblock eustachian tubes_,I took Claritan along with Sudafed for a possble allergy that caused my eustachian tubes to block. I'm not usually prone to depression_ but the second day went into a deep depression and cried for about an hour over a very minor problem. I could'nt understand what was happening to me until I read these side effects. I was going to stay on the meds for another 2 days_ but nothing seems to be working: in fact I may even feel worse.

I never research things like this_ but due to my constant symptoms after taking Claritin_ I figured it time to see what others may be saying about this pill. I have severe allergies which lead to head-ache_ stuffy head_ etc. Thus_ I've taken Claritin. I took it once before when I was a teenager. Having a sensitive stomach anyway_ it always made me sick to my stomach. I stopped taking it_ only to take a few within the last couple years. First of all_ I've never experienced such dry mouth in all my life. I can bare a little bit_ but not this much. My wife doesn't appreciate it very much_ either_ considering you have to brush your teeth every five minutes to keep your breath in decent fashion. Even still_ the remaining taste is horrid. First_ BE PREPARED TO WANT TO DRINK A TON OF WATER AND NEVER FIND RELIEF. In fact_ you'll probably begin vomiting because you've drank so much water! This is the most uncomfortable pill available to man. Does it help my allergies? Sure! But_ the effects it has on you with the rest of your body totally makes it a complete failure. I can't believe so much medicine treats certain problems but creates others. Watch out for the major insomnia_ horrible dreams_ and most of all_ the ANGER! It's makes you a very mean_ cranky and even depressed individual! I've tried Claritin for two years_ giving it a chance and hoping to build an immunity to the side effects.

879, 1, hayfever & other seasonal allergies,Constant dry mouth. Frequent urinationn_ causing improper food digestion_ that caused alot of bloating.,I was thinking for months that I was gaing weight in my stomach area and no-where else.  It seemed like no matter how little I ate_ or how much I exercised my stomach remained bloated.  But after a week of being off of the Claritn-D_ before I could get my next refill_ it all went away and my stomach went back to it's original flatness. I decided to even test it_ and go back on it to see it my stomach would bloat again_ and it did! Although it did seem to help itchy eyes_ nose and throat_ to me_ it is definately NOT worth the side effects.,F,22,5  months,11/19/2001Email,Claritin
