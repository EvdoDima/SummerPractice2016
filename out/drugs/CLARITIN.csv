0, 1, Sinus drainage,Wooziness_ dizziness_ numb feeling in hands and feet_ confusion_ blurred vision_ mental delay,This stuff is AWFUL! I have been recovering from mono_ strep_ and a sinus infection all at once so I wanted something to keep me from draining in my throat. It helped the drainage_ but made me feel like I was crazy. I debated going to the ER before I realized I've been taking the generic (loratadine) for the same amount of time as I've had symptoms. Claritin affects my sister very badly_ too.,F,19,10  days10 MG,8/12/2016,Claritin

2, 1, Seasonal allegies,Nausea_ vivid nightmares_night sweats_ hot flashes_ bloating_ loss of appetite_ change in taste_ paranoia_ intense depression_ anxiety_ rapid heart beat_ irritability_ moodiness_ headaches,I was convinced I was pregnant until I thought to put two and two together and realized all of these symptoms started when I started taking claritin. I got flutters of anxiety in my stomach over the weirdest things_ I felt legitimately terrified to go to sleep because of the nightmares_ I treated everyone around me like garbage like could've ruined my relationships. If you are bipolar or have any sort of mood disorder I would absolutely not recommend taking this cause it sends you on an evil war path for some reason. I couldn't figure out why I was being so mean to everyone but looking at other people's symptoms_ this makes perfect sense! I can't believe an allergy pill can turn a person into such a lunatic!,F,21,2  weeks10MG,6/28/2016,Claritin
3, 1, running nose_ itchy eyes_ sneezing,Day1 Hyperactive_ felt great.Day 2 Mild allergy-like symptoms returns.  Except eye irritation becomes worse than original symptom. Dry mouth_ sleepy. Day 3 Mild rash. Attribute rash to adhesive sensitivity as rash appears around minor skin wound site.  Day 4 Rash becomes raised and painful_ moves to parts of chest_ face and ears_ wound site looks angry_ skin becomes extremely sensitive to sunlight.  Discontinue Claritin. Day 5 rash and swelling go down in afternoon.  Expect rash to disappear in 24-48 hrs. Waiting for Dr appointment.,I mistook the reaction to Claritin for the allergic reactions I was using Claritin to treat. Starting Claritin caused inflammation_ soreness_ dry red itchy eyes.  Led to  inflammation and hives around wound site_ causing site to appear angry and infected. Stopping Claritin caused the inflammation and rash to subsided and wound site looks much better.  Taking Calritin caused far worse symptoms than the original hayfever symptoms and lengthened wound healing time.,F,40,4  days10 1X D,6/28/2016,Claritin

I began having migraines_ Scintillating scotoma they are called.  Couple this with anxiety_ weakness in my arms and legs_ I was a mess!

7, 1, Seasonal allergies,"I can understand the claim that claritin nearly destroyed a marriage. I usually take Allegra during my seasonal allergy episode. Heard great things about claritin and decided to give it a try. Began working after 3 days. After a week_ I noticed things began to smell and taste strange. Bacon and eggs were horrible_ I love bacon and eggs. Steak may as well have been rotten and baking in the sun on a hot road for a few days. I swear I could taste the dish soap used to clean dishes and told my wife to stop using that brand. I became certain she was washing_ but not rinsing the dishes properly and we went through all the dishes several times so I could be sure it wasn't the soap. The smell of food cooking became nearly stomach turning. The final straw was when a co worker and I went to make a repair on a new boat. The crew was cooking. I smelled bad grease_ and asked him what he smelled. He replied_ ""smells like Thanksgiving dinner."" I stopped taking claritin and went back to Allegra. It took almost a year to regain my sense of smell and taste. Took claritin for nearly a month. My suggestion_ if it works for you_ more power to you_ if you notice strange smells_ especially breakfast_ stop taking it right away! This is not a joke_ I don't care what the write up_ or contraindications (sp?) say. This actually happened to me. Hope this helps someone.",,M,44,1  months,5/23/2016Email,Claritin
8, 2, seasonal allergies,Extreme fatigue_ muscle aches_ occasional shakiness and feeling cold and loss of mental focus.  Sleep has been disrupted and I have been needing to take daily naps_ despite being highly physically fit and active.  Like other readers_ I chalked this up to a stressful time in my life and work schedule and perhaps going through having a minor bug or low adrenal functioning_ or the being in the early stages of peri-menopause.  I have felt more reactive than normal_ but again thought it was due to disrupted sleep alone at first or possible other issues_ as listed.  Stomach issues increased too_ and have had lower back pain for the first time in my life.  After reading more on the side effects_ I'm finding my cluster of symptoms resemble several other patients' self reports. I am stopping Claritin- not worth the side effects.,It does initially work well for stopping extremely bad allergies- I'm not usually bothered but the east coast this spring left me with breathing issues starting in April_ so I started Claritin to continue the outdoor sports and activities that I enjoy.  I do think some of the effect is cumulative and am hoping that this will start to work itself out of my system_ but expect it may take some time.  I won't take the chance again_ however_ with Claritin_ as I really think the side effects I'm experiencing are directly linked to this medication.  I recently had to change my primary care physician due to insurance changes_ and she did not take my change of energy that seriously_ but I don't think is aware of how drastic a difference this has been for me.  I will re alert the practice to the fact I due feel this is an issue specifically with Claritin.  I plan to report my issues to the FDA (Anyone may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088),F,46,28  days 1X D,5/19/2016,Claritin
9, 1, Seasonal allergies,Depression_ suicidal thoughts_ insomnia_ short term memory loss,When I started taking Claritin it did relieve my allergy symptoms but also was unable to sleep at night_ and the few minutes of sleep that I caught here and there I would have nightmares. I was depressed every day_ and at times I would just cry about nothing or something stupid_ also had thoughts of suicide. Boyfriend finally had enough of me one day and asked me what's going on with you you're acting different_ is there something your not telling me. Finally things came to a head one day and was unable to take Claritin for a couple days and all of the sudden I realized I was my normal self again.

Fell asleep and took another this morning and an hour later I could feel my heart pounding and I felt very jittery_ and then started getting anxious. My HR was around 100BPM and normally i'm at 70. I went to urgent care and on my way there my hands started tingling and felt cold_ and my mouth went dry. The doctor said some people have this sort of ""fight or flight"" reaction.

23, 1, Allergies,Stiff and painful joints in hands_ elbows_ knees and hips. Swelling of hands and legs. Vertigo when I would wake up. Horrible bloating and gas that would rise into my chest and burning in my stomach.  Hard time going to Sleep. Hard time concentrating and a bit loopy. No motivation.,I started taking Claritin in May of 2015 for my allergies. I liked it because it did not make me zombie like. It still made me a bit loopy but I could deal with it. I started having  bad joint pain in my hands and knees_ so bad that I could hardly climb up and down stairs. I asked my doc and she said that I was getting old (46) and it was to be expected especially with menopause coming on etc...I did tell her that Claritin was making me a bit loopy and she basically blew me off and said Claritin does not have those type of side effects and that even airplane pilots were allowed to take it because it was so safe. I took her at her word and continued to take the Claritin with no further thought. In October of 2015 I ran out of the Claritin and since it was winter did not pick up anymore hoping that I would not have to worry till spring. Through the holidays my allergies were tolerable and and interestingly (though I did not put 2 and 2 together) my bloating and stomach burning went away_ my joints no longer hurt and started feeling pretty good. About 2 weeks ago I was hit by a bout of allergies and picked up some Claritin. I took the 1st pill on a Thursday  and by Monday I felt the familiar stiffness and pain in my left hand and had horrible bloating. By Wednesday my knees hurt so bad I could hardly walk down the stairs and I could not even close my left hand in a fist and my right hand was also acting up as well as my elbows.

31, 1, Extreme seasonal allergies,"Hyperactive_ racing mind and attention deficit_ in that it was hard to focus on any task for long (ADHD?); increasingly aching joints to the point of real pain_ then ultimately an extreme lower backache (not experienced before Claritin); disrupted sleep (often by the pain mentioned above); suddenly lowered libido; vivid bizarre nightmares_ followed by lingering ""aftershock"" in the morning_ plus exhaustion_ depression and a despairing lack of motivation to do anything. (All of the above on 24-hour Claritin Reditabs_ NO pseudoephedrine - i.e_ NOT Claritin-D.)  I had to take increasingly larger dosages of aspirin_ turmeric_ and finally meloxicam (which pretty much incapacitates me and raises my BP to alarming levels) and xanax_ just to stop the increasingly  excruciating arthritic pain and nightmares_ and to get some sleep.Much like getting a ""fix"" on an illegal drug_ 20 mg of Claritin and coffee would have me allergy-free once again_ emotionally up and ready to go","I would give the basic Claritin two stars_ maybe three_ because at first_ it DID relieve my severe seasonal allergy symptoms amazingly well without drowsiness at 20 mg a day (the recommended dose in many countries other than the US). 10 mg did not seem to relieve allergy symptoms very much at all. Rather than causing ""increased sedation"" as the literature suggests_ the 20 mg actually felt like a shot of espresso at first (and this without pseudoephedrine [Claritin-D] involved). But the boost in energy and motivation lasted no more than 8 hours. The rest of the promised 24 hours was a long period of exhaustion_ insomnia_ inertia_ aching_ irritability_ paranoia_ unexpected feelings of resentment and bitterness. As others have commented_ I felt as if my very personality had changed - from tolerant and let-it-go to bitter and hostile.

32, 1, Sinuses_ fluid in inner ear,I have been experiencing some sinus issues_ along with dizziness because of some fluid in my inner ear for about 5 days. So I went to the doctor to get prescribed something to help with the sinuses and dizziness. She prescribes me Alavert (generic for Claritin). I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS MEDICATION AGAIN! Literally within hours of taking my first dose_ I start experincing racing heartbeat all throughout that night. Then right before I try to go to sleep my entire left arm completely falls asleep. So I literally got no sleep that night between my heart feeling like it was pumping out my chest and my arm feeling like 10000 needles are poking it. The next morning I awake up _ my heart has calmed down but my arm is still a very numb. Completely oblivious to the fact that this medication is the reason why I'm feeling all out of wack_ I take another peel right after breakfast_ the rest of the day I felt horrible! My heart continues to race and pound extremely hard_ my arm was still numb as hell and to add on to that My neck/throat was rightening up on me! Felt like my lymph nodes all along my neck were swollen! I have not taken another pill since this morning and I am still experincing the racing heartbeat_numb left arm and swollen lymph nodes in my neck! Trust me the side effects of this pill are not worth it all! Stay way!,If you're experincing racing heartbeat_ get a bucket/bowl of ice cold water and dunk your entire face in for 20-30 secs this helps bring your heart rate down. If it doesn't help the first time you dunk_ try it a couple more times.Doctors use this method when patients come in with racing heartbeat before resorting to medication.

I can see how claritin with pseudoephedrine_ for example_ might result in some of the symptoms being described_ but loratadine itself is such a benign drug_ and has no such contraindications or side effects as some seem to believe it does (on this Web site anyway). It sounds to me that many people here are experiencing nocebo effect_ which is (simply described) the converse effect of placebo.

The dosing on box addressed adults too. This was the first_ AND ONLY time I will ever take Loratadine (Claritin). I have to say the one dose cleared up my problem almost immediately_ but approximately 36 hours after taking it my mouth started to become increasingly dry to the point that I could barely swallow_ and my entire tongue felt as though I had burned it. The worst part was that this extreme dryness in my mouth lasted for 6 days. Any professional I consulted with said it should of been out of my system after 24 hours_ but apparently something remained. By day 6 I was so miserable I felt like I was at my wits end when I started to see some improvement in my saliva production. I will never again freely take any kind of over the counter medicine.

49, 1, Year round allergies,anxiety_ irritability_ anger_ paranoia_  heart palpitation_  hot flashes_ hormone imbalance_,After months of hot flashes_ heart palpitation and anxiety I decided to see my doctor. At first I thought I was going thru menopause however_ blood test results showed a hormone imbalance indicative of hyperthyroidism. Saw an endocrinologist. Initially diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Had blood tests performed for approximately 3 months but_ the T3 and T4 counts varied every single time there was really no pattern.  She was not sure what was going on. There was the question of Graves Disease. I started reading up on Graves and learned that it is an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones. Since Claritin D interacts with the immune system_ I began to wonder about its side effects and if it was possibly causing the hormone imbalance. (of note; Claritin D was the only medication I was taking. I was not and currently not on any other medication) I remembered that I had skipped taking Claritin D on days and/or a week or two in between blood tests.  I began to suspect that Claritin D was the cause of  the hormone imbalance. That's when I decided to stop taking it. I cannot declare Claritin D as the cause of the hormone imbalance. I think that would need to be researched however_ I have had TWO blood tests since I stopped taking ClaritinD and BOTH tests have been normal. I plan on following up with the endocrinologists in about a year. I will be happy to report back then.,F,46,6  years30MG 1X D,3/10/2015Email,Claritin

I don't get drowsy and I don't gain weight by being constantly hungry as I have with other antihistamines.,I take claritin in conjunction wit other mess for asthma and sinus problems.  I work in an environment with lots of allergy triggers.  It minimizes my reaction and helps me avoid sinus infections and asthma attacks.

55, 1, it made me feel awake and energized,I had been taking claritin D for a long time because i noticed that it would make me feel awake & energized. I read online that it was safe and not addictive so when I needed to get something done or was tired in the morning I would take it. Not until last week after days of not taking it I experienced an INTENSE anxiety attack my heart was racing i couldn't get it to slow down. I have always woken up tired in the morning but for the past 5 days now I have woken up with a racing heart WIDE awake. During these past few days I have experienced extreme anxiety_ it feels like my brain is on fire_ pressure in the back of my head_ jitteryness_ sweating hands & feet and increased heart rate. It's day 6_ i haven't taken it for over a week and I'm still experiencing these side effects. I will never take this drug again. I'm praying everyday that I will return to normal. This has been the scariest experience of my life.,AVOID THIS DRUG COMPLETELY. It's not worth the risks of the side effects.,F,23,1  years 1X D,10/31/2014,Claritin

59, 3, sinus isues,altered taste,Took this for a month noticed altered taste the first time but was also very sick with bronchitis and did not attribute it to the claritin. Was off it for a while and restarted it for fall seasonal allergy issues and noticed the altered taste again on the first day. It does not help me as much as Zyrtec did but it also doesnt make me tired like Zyrtec did so it is a compromise. It reduces my symptoms but does not aleviate them.,F,37,1  months10 mg 1X D,10/15/2014Email,Claritin
