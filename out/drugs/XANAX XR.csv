0, 5, GAD,Lowered anxiety significantly_ however the XR made me feel foggy the first few days I took it even though before I had been taking .25mg of regular Xanax 4x day_ the same dosage. I can feel it begin to taper off right at about the 12hr mark_ but not to the point where I feel like I need to take more. I sleep like a baby_ no more restless tossing and kicking around. I feel a little groggy when I wake up but it's an easy side effect to deal with in exchange for the benefit I receive.,If your GAD is affecting your quality of life_ take it. Stay on the smallest dosage that is most effective for you_ and just because you stop feeling side effects doesn't mean it isn't still working in the background_ so don't be quick to assume you need a higher dosage.,F,28,1  months1mg XR,4/24/2016,Xanax xr
1, 3, GAD,Sleep_ confusion_ too much of a good thing.,Avoid it if possible. Try to find other ways of reducing your anxiety. This drug is highly addictive and in the long run doesn't help.,M,69,3  years1 mg 2X D,3/26/2016,Xanax xr
2, 5, PTSD Chronic Anxiety Trauma,I have suffered with chronic anxiety..PTSD..depression and agoraphobia for years. My psychiatrist prescribed xanax 2mg xr when trauma hit that regular dose of .05 four times a day couldn't touch situationally. Had no knowledge that this form of xanax existed. Was a bit Leery..but tried. Not only did it completely/slowly prevent hospitalization _ but noted my agoraphobia was eased to point where health issues such as failing sight I was addressing where normally it would result in a number of cancelled appts. Too fearful to follow thru on. I had quality of life for a short time before my insurance took it off their formulary and my Dr. Abruptly ceased prescribing. What in the world could cause such a reaction? Is the extended dangerous for some reason unspecified? Why did my Medicare part D take this out of their formulary at the beginning of year? I caught a glimpse of quality of life..what happened?,,F,60,3  months,3/14/2016,Xanax xr

My practitioner  put me on the XR and increased from .5 to 1.5 when it seemed to even out the picking and anxiety. I have been on this dose most of my last 3 years. I am bad at taking medications and can miss it for a few days and I have no withdrawal symptoms at all.  It may not work for some people but I do know that it does for some and that includes me.

Besides that i have tried every benzo for my condition and have done so for years_  dont switch to valium if youve been on xanax XR to save money because you'll be better off taking a benadryll!,F,27,30  days4 mg 1X D,8/19/2011Email,Xanax xr
19, 4, Anxiety & Panic,Some tiredness at first_ but it passes. Maybe memory related issues_ but not sure.,"Diagnosed with Clinical Depression around 2005 after losing several family members and close friends during about a span of 2 years. Effexor = eventual NIGHTMARE. Lexapro 10 MG for several years worked well along with occasional Xanax .5 or Xanax XR .5. (A 30 day supply of each - Xanax - would last me 4 to 6 months) Tapered off Lexapro about 6 months ago and have felt okay without it_ but found I now take more Xanax XR .5 - at least one each day for several weeks now. Went back to Lexapro_ but starting it again was not going well at all. Lexapro ALWAYS gave me the feeling of ""brain cloud""_ but perhaps that was needed to not dwell on the loss_ fears_ etc. So_ now I'm only taking Xanax XR .5 once a day (in the morning) and do find it helps very much with panic and anxiety feelings. Have also started walking (usually too darn lazy for too darn long) and find that a 20 minute good paced walk is helping as well. Prayer is a must! I have to leave everything at the feet of the Lord and trust Him to take care of it. I like to keep my ducks in a nice row_ but most of the time they're all over the pond and I have to remember that God is in control. I don't like to take ""mental meds""_ but if I was a diabetic_ I'd be taking Insulin for that physical ailment.

I am told it will go away after a few weeks.,I have had very bad vertigo for the last 6 months with no cure so far. The last month I started to have severe anxiety and panic attacks due to my  health and all the worries that come along with it. The first time it happened I thought I was having a heart attack. Went to the hospital and they told me it was just a reaction to one of the new meds they were trying on me at the time. A few weeks and a few more hospital visits later I found out what it was. From the first day I started taking it I felt better. I am hoping that as the weeks go on it keeps getting better and the drowsiness goes away. It also has been helping a little with the vertigo. So far I would recommend it as the first start if you are having your attacks due to stress or medical issues.,F,31,5  days0.5 2X D,8/13/2010,Xanax xr
27, 1, Anxiety,I first started taking regular Xanax for about 6 months to treat moderate depression and anxiety_ most likely due to a high stress management job. Xanax had immediate positive effect -- I basically returned to normal.  I shifted to Xanax XR_ took for several months and then the problems began.  I had a panic attack which sent me to a hospital and other symptoms_ including muscle twitching and stiffening_ difficulty sleeping_ restlessness.  The neurological symptoms worsened and I began to fear a serious illness.  So what did my doctor do?  He increased my dose.  Fortunately_ I went to a neurologist who demanded I get off Xanax.  I weaned off over a 6 week period... no fun.  But the neurological symptoms appeared to worsen as did my anxiety.  I have been off for two years now and very close to normal.  But that year from hell_ in retrospect_ was a combination of high stress exasperated by an increasing dependence on Xanax.  To this day I am pretty convinced that Xanax had alot to do wit,Don't take it.  It is a quick fix_ but a potential trip to hell.  Fortunately_ and thanks to God_ I returned from hell.,M,52,1  years1 to 1.5mg 1X D,8/6/2010,Xanax xr

Took me five weeks to ween off and had to go down to .125 a day.  Withdrawals sent me to ER where the doctor gave me Vistaril_ a non-addictive antihistimine_ to counter the withdrawals and to help me sleep.  It was a God send.  The doctor there said that Xanax is not made to be taken on a regular basis.  It's only for breakthrough panic attacks on an as needed basis...not daily.  He said that if you are driving under the influence of Xanax_ you are charged the same as if you are DUI.  If somebody dies_ you go to jail.

32, 3, Panic Disorder_Agoraphobia_ GAD,dizziness_ drowziness_ blurred vision_ ataxia_irritability_ depression.,It worked great for awhile after clonazepam stopped helping.  I built up a tolerance to it so that now at 10 months_ I am at highest recommended dosage_ and not getting much benefit. Do not discontinue on your own. Seek doctors and/or pharmacists suggestions regarding tapering_ or see Dr. Ashtons manual online. Slow taper-you will have to switch from Xanax XR to regular Xanax as you taper since XR pills can not be split. Xanax can help where other anti-anxiety meds might not but short term use and at lowest helpful dose highly recommended. It can be addictive in some and if you find yourself needing more just to keep away withdrawal effects and/or it no longer seems to be working-contact your doctor ASAP. Ps. Make sure you get a CMP (complete metabolic panel) and/or other Dr. recommended blood tests every 2-3 months_ to make sure liver_kidneys functions not adversely affected by use. Not for use as an anti-depressant or for those with Borderline Personality Disorder.,F,40,10  months,10/22/2009,Xanax xr

The anxiety I had was a result of prednisone I had taken for a ulcer. Xanex made it OK for awhile but when I went off it made the anxiety I had to begin with seem like childs play. Going off of Xanex almost made me insane. I ended up in the emergency room twice.I had severe agoraphobia. Im so happy to know what caused these symptoms_ I had several doctirs tell me it was not the Xanex. Miraculously once I stopped taking it for a few months all my symptoms went away.

Overall not bad.,I used to take 3-4mg of regular Xanax(alprazolam) but went to Klonopin because I thought with the longer half life that it would be better_ 7 months later_ very depressed_ I feel like my glass is half empty_ Back to Xanax but XR version. I like it One pill a day_ sometimes need an extra .5 to 1mg but a great pill so far. You dont feel the hit like you do with Xanax but I havent felt a high in years from it_ I miss the feel of it.

42, 4, Bipolar/Anxiety,Sleepiness_ talk more_ dehydration_ depression may be worse_ restlessness_ agitation_ irritability (all when it starts to wear off),I like this medication because it doesn't make me go through withdrawal as soon.  The time-release really makes a difference in my body.  I was given regular Xanax a few times_ in the hospital_ which is how I realized the restlessness_ agitation_ irritability_ ect. are from this medication.  It was so intense they had to give me something else to get it to stop.  I still take this because I'm unable to get my anxiety/worry to stop on my own.  It also helps get rid of anger.  The problem I have with it is that it actually causes all of the symptoms it temporarily removes.  It's frustrating_ especially since my body has gotten too used to the lower dose.

When it starts to wear off I feel more alert but feel like my body is craving a drug. Like I need a cigarette.,I am being treated for depression. It seems the initial side effects of Paxil and Celexa induced my anxiety attacks to begin with. I believe that's why my doctor prescribed Xanax XR to counteract the effects of the Celexa. In the evenings after the drug wears off my head feels like I am under water and I'm a bit restless. I asked my doctor if he could cut me back but he wants me to take a .5 mg after I wake up and I don't understand why. He says the drug is not addictive but I feel like it is and I want off it.,M,37,7  months,1/11/2008Email,Xanax xr
48, 5, anxiety attacks,I suffer from anxiety very badly to the point where I am disabled from it.  Many things brought it out_ post tramatic stress_ having my thyroid removed (most people do not realize how much your thyroid levels could cause anxiety)_ and it has gotten much worse since starting menapause.  Since getting my thyroid out my body metabolizes medication fast so I have been taking .5mg of Xanax XR 4 times a day and have a couple of normal x25 xanax's for extremem situations.  So i am at about 2.5 max a day.  I am very concerned with being addicted but after the roller coaster of so many medications and expensive ones as well where I spend $100 take it for 2 days and so sick - i am back to my xanax routine.  Since menapause I am noticing I have to increase my medication.  I tried kolonopin_ some of the new medications that are out there nothing works for anxiety like xanax.  Oher positive is if you have thyroid disease or do not have one it will not interfer or mess up your thyroid medication.,If you get a generic watch where you purchase it from.  I got my prescription filled at Walmart once and had some serious issues the drug was not working like it use to.  After getting educated by the pharmacist at the hospital I never realized there is a big slidding scale as to how close to name brand a generic can be.  Walmart sells the cheepest generic drugs and the effectiveness of them especially with medications like these can have an effect on how well they work.,F,45,3  years,1/1/2008Email,Xanax xr

51, 5, Bipolar Disorder/Anxiety Disorder,None,I switched to this after taking Klonopin for 6 months to help reduce the sedation being caused by other medications I'm on.  Not only does Xanax XR work better than the Klonopin to reduce anxiety_ it's like it magically does it without making me tired.  I can't explain it.  It almost eliminates my anxiety in an easy-to-take single dosage in the morning and there's less of a chance of dependency - I was starting to get headaches if I didn't take the Klonopin every 8 hours to keep a constant amount in my blood stream.,M,22,2  months,9/21/2007,Xanax xr

53, 3, ,prerequisite increase in anxiety followed shortly by its decrease_ slight pulsing of the head and body after showering on what perhaps was a dose too large_ tingling_ a creeping grogginess,xanax can be easily abused and hence doesnt seem worth its desired effects _ i do not recommend this RX as a regular timed dose _ perhaps however xanax could be quite effective when taken as needed and used correctly,M,19,2  days,8/26/2007Email,Xanax xr

55, 5, Panic Disorder_ Anxiety,No side effects,I used to take the short-acting Xanax and was yanked off of it and went through horrid withdrawal.  After 9 months w/o the drug_ I saw a psychiatrist who finally talked me into Xanax XR.  I take 3 mg._ and it works well.  Part of me thinks the short-acting worked better_ because I was only on .5 mg._ but I can't make myself take it after what my stupid doctor put me through.  Don't ever let a primary care physician yank you off Xanax.  If you need it_ you need it_ and it is not harmful long term and is one of the best drugs for panic out there!,F,26,1  years,6/5/2007,Xanax xr
56, 4, Extreme anxiety part caused by SSRI,Extreme drowsiness and prolonged sleep. I sleep 9-11.5 hour nights yet I'm tired and yawning most of the day.,"I take 2mg every evening_ and I'm supposed to do so for two weeks_ and then reduce to 1mg for one week. I started taking them because the initial side effects for Cipralex/Lexapro (a SSRI-class drug) changed me from very anxious to EXTREMELY anxious_ I could barely get out of bed. With Xanax XR (known as Xanor Depot over here)_ I'm tired_ but I feel a lot better. All the anxiety isn't completly gone_ but considering the amount I had pre-treatment (after Cipralex_ before Xanax) this would probably help a ""normal"" patient a lot. Remember that benzo-class drugs should never be taken for prolonged periods of time_ though.",M,20,1  weeks,5/31/2007,Xanax xr

59, 5, Anxiety,This medication has given me back my life. I have suffered with severe ringing in my rights ear for years_ and bouts with vertigo_ diagnosed as Meniers Disease. For a few years I took just the regular (Non XR) does at .25 or .50mg as needed. Now with just one single does in the morning of 1.0mg_ I feel great_ can work all day with no anxiety_ also the ringing in my ear has been greatly reduced_ and I have not had a Vertigo attack again. I find I can stay off of it on weekends for a couple of days_ but my symptoms return if I don't take it on weekdays.,Xanax can cause daytime drowsyness if I don't get a good nights sleep_ so I have to force myself to get to bed in time. By nature I am a night owl. I read where some people get addicted to this drug_ personally I have never had a problem stopping taking it_ but my body for sure is very used to it. It works very well for me_ but I know it has the potential to be abused. Myself I am very carefull to take the minimum dose and never drink while taking it. Again its given me back my life.,M,55,2  years,3/23/2007,Xanax xr
60, 4, Anxiety_ depression,At .5 once daily - constipation_ sexual dysfunction.  At 1.0 daily - symptoms that are more like withdrawl than normal symptons,I used to take regular Xanax as needed_ but started the .5 XR about 6 weeks ago.  After one month_ I started taking 1.0 daily_ and I started having episodes of nervousness_ headaches_ irritable bowels with cramps_ and occasional nausea.  It's weird as though I feel fine and then all of a sudden I will have one of these symptoms.  This is supposed to be time released and a continous dosage_ but I'm starting to think that when the medication releases_ I feel good - then the level lowers or something.  I called my doc_ and she doesn't think these things are caused by the medication.  Since these symptoms are worse in the morning (before my next dose is due)_ I would kind of lean towards the probabilty that it is the way it's released.  Has anyone else out there experienced this?,F,40,6  weeks,1/25/2007,Xanax xr
61, 5, GAD_ Health Anxiety_ OCD,Very mild_ brief drowsiness at 0.5 mg twice daily.,Has alleviated most symptoms related to anxiety and I am able to function arguably well compared to recent months. I am taking this medication in combination with Lexapro 2 mg once daily and Buspar 7.5 mg twice daily. I didn't believe it was significant in my recovery until I missed a dose and found out quickly just how much it actually was helping to decrease my symptoms.,F,23,3  weeks,11/7/2006,Xanax xr

64, 5, Tinnitus/ Panis attacks,At first I wasnt taking it at the same time everyday. Spometimes I took 2 .25 doses and some days 3 doses. I found myself to be an emotional wreck. I started taking 3 doses a day 1 at 9 am 1 at 3 pm and 1 at 9 pm of .25mg  as long as I kept my times and doses the same I leved out and the ringing in my ears quieted down. When the ringing would get loud it would cayse me to panic and then the ringing would get worse. I was stuck in a vicious circle and xanax has help me with this. NOTE THIS IS NOT THE XR. JUST XANAX,,M,42,6  days,9/8/2005Email,Xanax xr
