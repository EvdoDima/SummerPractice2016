0, 1, toenail fungus,loss of taste_ nausea_ severe headache,I stopped taking this medication one week ago.  I had been struggling with the nausea and headaches_ but everything online indicated that it would resolve_ but then suddenly lost sense of taste.  At first I thought something was wrong with the food.  Prior posts are completely accurate; persistent salty taste_ even plain water.  Oatmeal is okay_ but can detect nothing sweet.  Chocolate is the worst.  I even tried spicy food_ but most things I can sort of taste for one bite and then nothing.  Everything tastes like paste.  I am so disappointed because I was not warned by my physician or the pharmacist.  This is so devastating_ and I can only hope my sense of taste returns.,F,55,45  days250 1X D,8/14/2016Email,Lamisil at
1, 2, toenail fungus,The first few days I had a slightly upset stomach. Then began noticing I had episodes of dizziness and nausea. Today I got so dizzy and nauseated that I vomited and had to leave work early. I thought I might not make it home safely. Am stopping this med and notifying my podiatrist.,,F,68,8  days,8/11/2016,Lamisil at
2, 1, Toenail fungus,Started off as feelings of gastric reflux/indigestion for a few hours after taking it. After a few days turned into nausea that seemed to last longer after each time I took it. After 7 days the nausea was constant and increasing_ my head felt fuzzy_ difficulty concentrating and some mild upper abdominal pain. At day 9 I had severe nausea and felt as though I was being poisoned so stopped taking it. Initially after stopping I experienced gradual recovery but at about 48 hours after stopping I experienced the most severe nausea  and now 72 hours I'm starting to feel a bit better. I tool the tablet in the evening after dinner so getting to sleep was difficult.,Obviously it affects different people differently. I was very reluctant to try it because of the reported side effects so as soon as the started to really kick in I just had to stop as it just didn't feel worth compromising my very good health. I've tried almost everything and my last try will be canesten nail set and if that doesn't work I will take my doctors recommendation and go back to camouflaging it with nail polish (sorry guys),F,47,8  days250 1X D,7/29/2016,Lamisil at
3, 1, Fungal infection,Sudden Loss of taste. Foul taste constantly in my mouth. Slimy feeling in my mouth like it was rubbed with shortening. Cannot taste sweets at all_ some things I can taste on first bite_ but after that it might as well be cardboard.,My doctor nor pharmacist thought loss of taste was a side of defect. I had to find it on line and I believe there is more than 3% of people who suffer_ and I mean SUFFER from this side effect. I really don't care that is is temporary. No drug should be on the market that can do this. This is debilitating_ depressing and alters your whole life. I cry when a I get to the grocery store. I have to ask My husband  what he wants to eat as nothing sounds good. I can't remember how things taste. People laugh it off and say_ wow_ that's a great diet to be on. So I don't tell people. I want to taste things again!!,F,54,45  days250 1X D,7/2/2016Email,Lamisil at
4, 1, Toe nail fungus,I took lamisil for toe nail fungus one month.  Don't know yet if it will work.On the last day of taking pill I developed severe diaherra.  After 8 days_ I went to see my doctor.  She gave me stool and blood tests which turned out normal.  She sent me to a GI doctor.  GI doctore said my diaherra was inflamed from Lamisil.  He called it drug induced microscopic colitis from Lamisil.  Doctor put me on 2 weeks of Pepobismal.  I'm hoping it will work.   I wish I never took this drug_ it's made me miserable.,,F,57,1  months250mg,6/8/2016,Lamisil at
5, 1, toenail fungus,After two months of taking this medication_ I went to the dentist to discover I had a cavity. I immediately stopped taking Terbinafine. I also gained 20 lb in the 6 months that followed_ while eating the same foods and with the same level of activity. I also got pretty bloated. It has now been 15 months since I stopped taking it_ I am still 20 lb overweight and bloated.,While trying to fix a cosmetic problem that no one sees_ I got visibly fat and bloated and put a hole in my tooth. Not worth it.,F,30,8  weeks1x day,6/1/2016Email,Lamisil at
6, 1, Toe nail fungus,Loss of sweet taste and alteration of other tastes.,After 60 days I realized nothing tasted right and I couldn't taste any sweets.  It's been 5 weeks since the onset of these symptoms.  I've lost weight and pretty depressed this has happened to me.  No one told me this was a risk.  I'm afraid my taste may not come back or not return 100 percent.,M,60,60  days250 1X D,5/29/2016,Lamisil at

8, 1, Toenail Fungus,I was driving on the freeway at 60 miles per hour when I started feeling dizzy and lightheaded.  It's been three days now that I can't drive.  Every time_ the same thing is happening.  There should seriously be a warning on the bottle about driving!  Have not taken the medication for two days but it is still happening. This drug is NOT worth risking your life.  Sending a complaint to the FDA!,,F,45,7  days250 mg,3/20/2016,Lamisil at
9, 1, Toenail Fungus,Horrible salty taste in mouth and no to very little taste when eating food.  The first two days of diminishing taste I thought something was wrong with the food.  By the third day it became apparent what the problem was and I stopped taking the drug.  It has been over a week with no improvement.  Looks like I could have many weeks to go.,I was very hesitant to take this drug because of all the warnings.  My GP assured me that none of his patients have had problems and so I decided to finally get rid of my toenail fungus.  I WISH I HAD BEEN MORE HESITANT!,F,56,6  weeks250 MG 1X D,3/19/2016,Lamisil at

12, 3, Toenail Fungus,Have yet to have any side effects.Only rated a 3 because I haven't seen any changes yet_ but it's only been 2 weeks.,Had toenail fungus since I was in high school. After 7 years_ I have it on half of my toenails.  My parents didn't want to put me on lamisil when I was younger because of the side effects.  I was prescribed Lamisil by my doctor who EDUCATED me on the risks of Lamisil such as liver problems that is why she made me take a complete blood test to see if my liver would be able to take the trauma of this pill.  I take it at 9 pm before I go to bed so I wouldn't feel any nausea if there would be any.  Had one night where I couldn't swallow the pill due to the taste (HORRIBLE!) I found that it helps taking with a thicker liquid such as milk.  If you're thinking about just removing your toenail_ I also did it_ got the nail bed scraped of all fungus_ changed out all my shoes_ and put on a topical anti-fungal medicine every night. still got fungus_my doctor told me that taking your nail off just traumatizes your nail bed.  Luckily my nail grew back semi-ok.  The problem is that fungus is systemic meaning it runs through your blood and you can take off your toenail but it'll probably grow back. There are a lot of risks with taking Lamisil but personally I'd rather not live with nail fungus for the rest of my life.  My important tips would be to take it with food_ DO NOT drink alcohol_ and pray to the Gods haha (or buddha_ allah_ universe_ Leonard Nimoy_ etc.) In 2 more weeks I'll be going back to the lab for another blood test to see if my liver is okay to continue taking this drug.,F,24,18  days250 mg tab 1X D,2/18/2016,Lamisil at
13, 1, Toenail Fungus,Kidney pain on both sides. Not sure if its kidney but I have sting pain on both sides almost near back side of lower torso.,I've had toenail fungus for about 15years. The left toe nail is infected_ and the right toenail and two other toes are also infected. I decided to give this medication a try. I did read the side effects of the medication_ one that concerned me the most was that of kidney pain or failure. Well the first day I took the medication the sides_ I'm thinking kidneys started to hurt. I kept taking them and today is the fourth day. I may have to stop taking them because of fear of permanent kidney damage. By the way_ I believe my self to be a healthy guy_ have been vegetarian for 5 years now.,M,30,4  days250mg 1X D,2/9/2016,Lamisil at
14, 2, toenail fungus,no noticeable side effects_ maybe a very slight wheeze in the middle of my lungs when lying down sometimes_ maybe slightly darkened urine at times. I tried to drink more water and avoided alcohol generally while taking the medication.,"(I only marked ""not satisfied"" because a rating was required and my toenail did not respond to the treatment.)  I  took the generic version Terbinafine HCL 250 mg tablet_ one tablet daily for one week each month (pulse method) for six months. Unfortunately there was almost no change_ the fungus area is not gone. I asked doctor if I should try taking it all month rather than one week per month. He said no because if it was fungus it would have responded by now and the all month regime has a higher risk of liver damage etc.  Doctor will not prescribe again_ he believes it must be psoriasis of the nail since it did not respond to the Lamisil. However_ I don't have any other psoriasis issues thankfully_ it is only one toenail_  and I am still not convinced it isn't fungus_ because it seems to resemble fungal infection of the toenail in every way. I think I will probably go to a podiatrist and have that area of the toenail removed and try topical medications on the nail bed. See if I get any improvement. Good luck to everyone here.",F,50,6  months 7X M,1/27/2016Email,Lamisil at

16, 1, Toenail fungus,Diarrhoea_ vomiting_ insomnia_ depression_ anxiety_ itching,Absolutely awful side effects for me after taking for just 6 days. Insomnia (it's 4am and I'm wide awake right now_ if that tells you anything)_ diarrhoea and vomiting (both of which I had within the past hour)_ and exacerbating my pre-existing depression and anxiety_ inducing a very negative generalised sense of unease and dysphoria. What's more_ apparently it takes months and months to get this poison out of your system entirely_ even after taking it for just a few days. If I can deter just one person out there from starting this medication_ it's worth it: this drug is the stuff of nightmares and should be pulled from the market. Buyer beware_ it's not worth the risk. Read all the negative reviews out there.,M,40,6  days250,1/21/2016,Lamisil at

I have 3 weeks to go and all my toenails_ including the big ones which were the worst-affected_ are growing out clear. Hopefully I won't need another month as the no-alcohol regime is a killer! My doctor told me that the key with this drug is consistency_ so I've been careful not to miss a dose.

I am a sports fanatic (gym_ run swim 5 times per week) in my 30s.

I am thrilled.  I've seriously limited my alcohol intake (decreased 99%) while I was taking it and took liver support supplements just in case.  I've also sprayed all of my shoes with antifungal_ thrown out some of them_ and bought all new socks just in case.  My Dr. said I'll need to use the topical lamisil for the rest of my life to prevent reinfection.  So be it.  Totally worth it!,F,46,90  days80 1X D,4/6/2015,Lamisil at
26, 4, ,Im not sure if it was lamisil but i had a strange cramp feel in my inner thigh to my knee.,Man i was on the fence about taking the drug for years since i like to drink and my liver enzymes were elevated. But i begged my Dr to prescribe them to me and promised to quit my drinking. I didnt. Im not encouraging anyone to do what ive done but i have no ill side effects. I have 5 pills to go and i cant believe the drastic improvement on my nails! I had thick crusty nasty toenails for years! They are starting to look pink again under my tow nails! I only had one good toe nail and it was very very difficult to conceal my nails all these years. Its actually taken 4 months and a week to finish my pills as i didnt take a pill when i wanted to go out and drink. I know i sound like a fool but i feel great and im almost done with the pills! I hope they continue to grow out nice the way they are. I didnt notice change for about 6 weeks. Very happy!

29, 1, Toenail Fungus,Developed severe case of skin lupus and put on topical steroids.  Pain is constant with itchy welts covering my entire body.  I stopped taking the drug a month ago and the rash is getting worse_ not better.  This is absolute poison and the FDA should ban it. Unfortunately_ since 2013_ drug manufacturers can no longer be sued.  Any complaints have to go to the FDA.  I have already spent hundreds of dollars trying to cure myself from this damage and I am being told by the doctor that I might never get better.

I am going to muscle through unless the doctor pulls me off of it because I am ALREADY seeing results on my toenails. Liver function test scheduled on 12/2.,Also using tea tree oil on the nail bed... makes all the difference.  As far as the nausea_ what I am finding is that if I eat bland_ easily digestible foods such as soup_ applesauce_ meal replacement shakes etc... it makes it easier to get through.  Also ginger tea and mints.  Sandals by summer! P.S. Not pregnant.,F,32,12  days250 1X D,11/18/2014Email,Lamisil at
31, 3, toe nail fungus,After 10 days I felt very poorly but as I had taken this medicine before about fifteen years ago I remembered it had occurred before and was not concerned.  However_ at about two weeks I started to have a mild feeling of pain just to the right of my breastbone and had quite a bit of non-productive coughing.  The feeling of pain in my chest spread to cover most of both of my lungs. After five weeks on the medicine the problems with my lungs have cleared up and I no longer have any chest pain.  I was never short of breath.  About 30 days in I started to experienced digestive upset with a lot of burping and mild nausea.  I have found that drinking a lot of water helps. I plan to stay on this medicine throughout the entire 90 course of treatment unless bloodwork comes back that tells me to do otherwise.,To the people who seem to think that toe nail fungus is just cosmetic:  When I took this medicine before  I had let the nail fungus live in my system for a long time.  Not only did I have toe nail fungus but it also caused the skin on my feet to severely split enough that lint from the socks would get caught in the cracks and hold them open.  I also developed severe painful seeping rashes on my wrists and the back of my neck.  This fungus can get into your blood stream and become systemic.

The pain radiated down into my lower arm/hands on BOTH sides of my body now. I stopped the medication September 19th so I have been off it for about 3 weeks now. My body is still messed up. I have a burning 'hot' sensation in my arms and legs now and constant muscle pain. I am hoping this goes away after the meds leave my system. My doctor has referred me to a rhematologist (apparently Terbafine can cause a form of Lupus).,I do not recommend this drug. I read before taking the medication the side effects_ but since i'm a healthy 30 year old (workout 6 x /week) eat healthy_ i didn't think i would be feeling the way i do.

I am obese_ so I guess I was prone to kidney problems on these lamisil pills_ and reading other people complaints_ they don't realize they are messing with their kidneys.

It might work for some_ but I wish doctors would tell you about the risks_ and not just leave it to us to read the pamphlets_ and google it. Not to mention the risk to my liver as well!

As far as taste_ so far no problem and in the booklet it says to take it with food. I noticed potential problem with awfull taste if I leave the pill a split second too long inside my mouth but now I make sure it goes down quick with mushy food(morning cereal)_ so so far no problem.

54, 1, Toenail Fungus,"Severe nausea_ vomiting_ stomach pain_ diarrhea_ fever_ chills_ sore throoat_ headache_ joint pain and swelling_ dizziness/spinning sensation_ itchy rash head to toe_ including ""butterfly"" rash on face.",Took the generic version of Lamisil (terbinafine) to treat a fungal infection in two toenails.  I experienced only mild side effects at first_ but they were expected_ so I didn't worry.  Around the start of week four_ they got MUCH worse; however_ they occurred during flu/virus season_ so I thought I had a nasty bug I couldn't get rid of.  Seemed like my immune system was not working well_ which scared me until I tracked the start of the symptoms.  Coincided with the start of this medication.  Called my doc_ he told me to stop taking it immediately.  Ten days later_ some of the symptoms have eased up_ but not all.  Still have nausea_ dizziness/spinning sensation_ fever and chills_ headaches and the itchy head to toe rash.

56, 1, Toenail fungus,My sense of taste started coming back after 12 weeks. What a relief! My experience is very similar to what has been described on this forum. I lived on diluted soups for weeks and could not taste anything sweet. Everything was salty and disgusting. Nuts and cheese surprisingly were not too bad. It is now 18 weeks since I stopped the tablets (under the generic name of Terbinafine) and although things are not back to normal yet_ there has been a marked improvement even in the last few weeks. I wanted to come back to this forum as it brought me a lot of comfort to know I was not on my own suffering from awful food tastes. My GP had never heard of this although he had been prescribing the drug for 15 years. I was so worried it was going to be permanent. I can therefore say to other sufferers that things will improve but the progress is slow. Do not despair!,,F,53,5  weeks250mg 1X D,1/3/2013,Lamisil at
57, 1, Toe fungus,Initially_ dizziness.  Severe loss of taste_ salty taste in mouth_ buttock/leg pain,"TAKE THIS DRUG AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Many have had good results.  The severe loss of sense of taste is almost unlivable and not worth the risk.  You don't have any idea how much you enjoy the taste of food until you can't taste it anymore.  I could live with the rear end/leg/hamstring/ankle pain (had to see a physical therapist)_ but am 5'6"" and 120 lbs. and cannot afford the weight loss_ especially when my doc did not tell me this could happen.  I would NEVER have taken this medicine.   I took it for 40 days of a 90 day course before I connected the med to my loss of taste; by then it was too late.  Since my doc was on vacation_ I d/c it myself.  Quit taking it 6 days ago and trying to eat anything I can to sustain my weight. But food is bland and/or disgusting.  Please think carefully about taking this medicine before you start_ or_ at the very least_ reassess once your sense of taste even seems to be A LITTLE funny.",F,40,40  days250mg 1X D,12/29/2012Email,Lamisil at

People should know they need to stop eating sugar and most starch. I'm using this drug in conjunction with a new way of eating. Also I read that a better protocol is to take lamisil for four weeks then off for four weeks then back on for four. Studies show this protocol is as effective as taking it all 12 weeks!

59, 4, Toenail fungus,Lamisil is an antifungal_ and antifungals kill candida yeast_ everyone has some yeast but many people have too much which is why we get systemic disease like toenail fungus to begin with. The reason we can't all just use a cream is because it is in our bloodstream. So I am a sugar addict_ drink wine nightly_ live on caffeine_ and love carbs. So of course I feel crappy after a few days of this medicine as it kills it all off. I have headaches_ stomach discomfort_ brain fog_ itching_ feel feverish_ and lethergic. BUT I would also have all these symptoms if I did the natural diet and cut out the sugar_ it is not just the Lamisil people. Take the test if you have symptoms of candidiasis and you will see_ most of you probably do if you have toenail fungus. I can choose to eat sugar_ try and consume alcohol and feel crappy in a month or two or I can try and wipe this whole thing out by eating healthy and feel great.,By the way_  this is my fourth time having toenail fungus. The first of which was in High School for which I saw a podiatrist who gave me Sporonox for 3 months with liver tests. Same terrible die off symptoms. Then it came back again in my late teens for which the same podiatrist gave me Lamisil_ same die off symptoms but perfect nails again! Later in my 20's after I lost my insurance I talked my doctor into giving me Nizoral which also fixed the toenails and for which I felt miserable on initially. Now here I am again_ in my 30's taking Lamisil again for toenail fungus after being years without insurance. I will always battle with yeast which feeds off the sugar I crave and will thus always risk relapse on the fungus. If I would consistently stay on a proper diet_ who knows_ maybe I could avoid this repetitive dance.,F,33,90  days250 1X D,10/1/2012,Lamisil at
60, 1, Toenail Fungas,Taste Loss,Horrible experience with this drug.  Dr. told me the only side effect to worry about was liver damage.  Had me take a blood test for liver function before use_ was all clear. Had a follow up test about 6 weeks into treatment_ all clear.  Sudden lost of taste around 50 days which I though was because of a cold or sinus infection.  Stopped the drug as soon as I figured it out. It is miserable not being able to tast anything.  I am hoping it returns soon.  I have read many comments and it seems that it should be back but could take weeks or even months.  I called the Dr. and he said he was unaware of this side effect and to stop taking the drug. (duh!) He said I should call the pharma company and talk with them.  They told me this was a side effect and tastse should gradually return sometime between 3 - 4 weeks and 3 - 4 months!,M,42,55  days250 MG 1X D,10/1/2012Email,Lamisil at
61, 3, Toe fungus,nausea_ vomiting_ breakthrough bleeding.,I actually had a lot of side effects. Initially_ I started taking the pill at night and I suffered from upset stomach and nausea. One night_ I had a single beer and spent the rest of it puking up everything I ate the day before. I switched to taking the pill first thing in the morning and that finally stopped. I was even able to have a beer or glass of wine with dinner without that effect. Also_ I am on birth control and experienced breakthrough bleeding. I never had it before (being regular for 8+ years) so it was quite a shock. I noted that I'm 'somewhat-satisfied' because it did get rid of my fungus. I guess from this forum this pill really does effect everyone differently. I would recommend checking out other options.,F,23,3  months250 1X D,8/30/2012,Lamisil at

This drug must build up in the system as a couple of days after stopping the side effects were still continuing. I woke up with severe dizziness and vomiting_ it was scary. It took a whole month to recover from the dizziness. It has been  been 2 1/2 months since I stopped taking terbinfine and I am still suffering a burning prickly tongue.

64, 4, Toenail fungus (5 toenails),On day 25 I had taste disturbance during one meal but it went away. I noticed this happened the day I ate too many sweets so I've cut down on sugar dramatically. Bad rash developed the same day_ but I stopped scratching and it went away. Liver enzyme test came normal after 4 weeks on treatment. But on day 44 I started experiencing extreme fatigue and really bad back pain. I've been consuming too much caffeine so this might have trigger the pain in combination w/the drug since I had been ok before consuming too much coffee. I have lost my appetite but if you have weight issues this might be a positive thing.,I am determined to finish the treatment despite the symptoms since having toenail fungus has affected my self steem tremendously! Fungus feeds off sugar so I'm limiting my intake of sweets. As fungus dies_ toxins from the decay of fungi is released into the body which cause symtoms_ so drinking lots of water flushes them out.

67, 1, Toenail Fungus,I took this medicine for 6 days.  At first I was just lethargic. I didnt want to leave the house and I had a horrible metallic taste in my mouth.  I have been  brushing my teeth 5-6 times a day.  I actually got up in the middle of the night at 3:30am and brushed because of the taste.

70, 1, Toe Nail Discoloration,I starting taking Terbinafine (Lamisil) and was only able to take 21 days of my 30 days supply. The reason for my discontinuing of this awful drug was because I suddenly broke out in this really back itch that is very hard to describe. The best way to describe it is imagine a itch that just continues to move throughout your body and no matter how much you scratch it just seems to get worst than before. Once it stops in one area it then begins in a entire new area. It leaves bruises on your body and oatmeal baths and benedryl just don't do it!I was prescribed this drug from my foot doctor after using a topical polish for about 8 months. The polish didn't work but_ it also didn't give me this crazy itch that doesn't seem to be getting better. Been off this poison for about 3 weeks. The itching has subsided partially. Meaning_ I am still itching like crazy just not as much throughout the day. I do try not to scratch but_ it is very hard to ignore. The reason why I try not to scratch is because once I start it seems as if it don't stop!The only got thing Dr. Narenberg did was give me a liver profile because after experiencing the side effect I haven't been able to get in touch with him!,,F,37,3  weeks250,7/12/2012,Lamisil at

However_ I also take birth control pills and it seems I am experiencing the side effect of ""irregular periods"" -- I haven't had a period for 3 months now (I am not pregnant.) I'm not completely sure  this is due to the Lamisil but as it is a very harsh drug and this side effect is listed_ I am assuming this is the reason.  Has anyone else experienced this side effect?

Toenail fungus just keeps getting nastier and uglier over time!! Please just give it a try!! A year and a half of trying topical prescriptions and at home remedies and getting nowhere was enough for me. I felt very self-conscious in open toed shoes which made the summer miserable for me.

91, 3, fungus in all toenails,Have had chronic toenail fungus in all toenails since I was 14 that started with sports/injuries of stubbing toes or ripping nails off and always grew back ingrown _thick and mis-formed ...... at 34 I have other digestive problems but from what I could tell I had NO side effects from Lamisil,my left foot has completly cleared of the fungus excluding the big toe which is cleared up but grow's slowly so not sure how it will look when it grows out it may still be mis-shaped but without the dry_yellowed cracked look...................... now for some reason I had NO improvement to the right foot.... this seams odd to me_ why would that be?,M,34,2  months250 1X D,9/4/2011Email,Lamisil at
92, 1, Toenail Fungus/Discoloration on Toe,Sudden and Complete Loss of Taste- Thought I was going crazy_ I suddenly couldn't taste anything or to describe it another way everything I put in my mouth tasted like raw bread dough_ even water. AWFUL!!!!,I had NO idea I would loose my sense of taste on this medication_ the doctor that prescribed this medication had no idea either. The loss of taste had me so confused and distraught. Everyone kept telling me I must have picked up a head cold or something which didn't make sense_ it wasn't until I went back to the doctor in complete anxiety and frustration that he looked it up on some prescription side effect application and we both realized that this could be a side effect of this AWFUL POSION!!! Been off the drug for 14 days now and can taste a tiny bit of salty things at the front of my tongue_ nothing in the back and nothing sweet. Had I known this before I would have lived with my funky toenail or done laser instead. My doctor said it could take up to 400 hours to purge this poison out of my system_ after reading everyone's comments I think it will be a lot longer_ probably going back to the doctor to get a liver test at this point. Avoid this medication at all costs. I am PRAYING my taste comes back fully and my thoughts go out to all that are in my same predicament.,M,45,62  days250 1X D,8/31/2011,Lamisil at

95, 5, toe nail fungus,At the beginning_ I had some stomach pains and headaches (1st week only) and then I thought I would talk to my doctor about these side effects... he told me to keep going_ so I did. I asked him to give me a blood test to check my liver after a month of taking lamisil and the results came fine. I even drink occassionally. My doc told me there is no real proof that you cant mix alcohol and lamisil... so if your young and healthy I dont see the problem of drinking (and i mean like alot of drinks). If your're scared_ just keep taking the test for your liver. I also had green stools but it wasn't frequent. If you do get green stools often_ then it may indicate that food has passed through your intestines faster than normal_ before it could be changed from green to brown so you should consult your doctor.,I've had toe nail fungus for the longest time cause I've been playing soccer since I'm a kid... and I've spend alot of money on other products and lamisil seems to have worked for me. My toe nails are growing nice again...It's quite a relief to finally be able to walk with sandals without being embarassed about your feet. I guess everybody reacts differently to the medication_ hence why all the various comments on this board...which is quite normal being that everybody reacts differently to the medication. Hope it works for you... if not you will need alot of patience and dedication with other products because they are not as effective that is for sure.,M,27,120  days250mg 1X D,8/23/2011,Lamisil at

NO ONE told me_ including my doctor_ that you can't ake Lamisil if you have any kidney problems.

For me_ it took awhile to put together that the Lamisil was causing the problem_ because I had recently had middle ear surgery and  I thought all the taste issues were stemming from that.,I stopped taking the Lamisil!  I am washing my tongue with soap once a day_ rinsing with water. It has helped relieve the discomfort.  Will see my doctor tomorrow.  From what I read_ it could be 4 more months before normal taste returns.  My nails are clear now_ but the medicine is clearly poison.

That is until one doctor prescribed Terbinafine. I have completed 2 weeks of the course with another 2 weeks to go and the infection has cleared completely.

This was followed by fatigue and a flu-like feeling. Caused bloating_ gas_ and weight gain of 400gm.,I never thought the cream could cause such side-effects. Until I realised what was causing these symptoms_ I was scared out of my wits. Obviously there is a big range of sensitivity to this and the tablets_ but there are other anti-fungal treatments out there_ and this cream wasn't even all that effective after 3 weeks.,F,40,21  days 2X D,5/30/2011,Lamisil at

Despite me usually being suspicious when it comes to natural remedies_ I was so desperate after 10 days of no taste/salt taste in my mouth that I tried Milk Thistle - and 3 days after starting to take it_ my sense of taste has improved significantly.

I'd read many reviews where people experienced hives_ headaches_ loss of taste and nausea. i must say after taking this for 30 days I have not experienced any of those problems. My feet have completely changed and i no longer has cracked or thick skin on my feet. I advise anyone who is taking it to take it at night rather than during the day.

I was told it may take a while for the effects to wear off as the medicine is metabolized in the liver and has to completely clear out before the effects are gone.

But_ I realized that this seems to be the best pill on the market for toenail fungus.  My doctor was going to put me on something different.  After comparing the two meds on the internet I realized that Lamisil is the best one to cure the problem.  So I figured I would try it again_ but not let the pill touch my tongue.  So far it is working_ try put some liquid in your mouth and then put the pill in your mouth with more liquid. Swallow it fast.  This is preventing that metallic taste I had the first time around.

111, 3, Toenail Fungus on 8 of 10,None.  Although_ I am itching like crazy after eating a bunch of chocolate.,I just started Lamisil 10 days ago and so far have experienced none of the side effects others have complained of.  I was skeptical at first because of the overwhelming number of negative reviews and side effects.  When my podiatrist prescribed it_ I was really nervous to start taking it.  Having read all of the side effects of this_ it reminds me of the side effects of candida/yeast die off.  My youngest child is autistic and very often autistic children have an overgrowth of candida and undergo antifungal treatments to rid their bodies of this overgrowth.  The side effects are nearly identical to that die off.  They can make you pretty miserable.  They can be so severe sometimes that you wouldn't recognize your own child due to the moodiness and irritability.  Aside from being extremely itchy tonight after I ate too much Valentine's chocolate_ I have had none of the side effects.  It may be too early for me as I am only 10 days into treatment.  I have actually had more energy and felt pretty good.  I'm curious to see what the following weeks will bring.  I saw another poster say not to let the pill touch your tongue.  I think I will give that a try and see if helps with the taste issue.,M,35,10  days250mg 1X D,2/11/2011Email,Lamisil at

So happy wearing open toe shoes! I had resisted the idea of using Lamisil for years because of the scare stories. Absolutely no ill effects whatsoever from this drug. Very_ very happy with it.

I just got another 90 days.  The doctor said once it has all grown out and I have cut the remaining affected nail off it should not spread anymore.

Matter of fact_ the bottom of my feet are now smooth again which used to be rough_ cracking and peeling. Granted I hate the dizzyness_ vertigo_ and the pain in the back of my neck_ especially the anxiety attacks_ I keep remembering the pain I was in before and these side effects don't compare (yet).

I called the pharmacist and she said she had never heard of it either.  When she looked it up she came back and told me 2.8% of people have loss of taste.  Why didn't the side effects mention this.

I have never had any prior hair loss.  I also noticed joint pain_ in elbows knees and ankles.,For me_ I don't think it was worth it.  I could not exercise for 3 months while taking it.  Just mild exercise gave me a pounding headache.  I felt tired an hung over all the time_ and became irritable and snapped at people when my head hurt.  I also had unusual sharp pains in my ankles and knees and elbows at times.  After 90 days_ my big toe was about 70% free of the white fungus that had completely covered it before I started.  Had it not been working I would have stopped taking it_ but I hung in there.  If the toe fungus comes back I will NOT take Terbinafine(Lamisil) again.

128, 5, Severe skin fungus,None,"I thought I would weigh in on Terbinafine a bit because of the low rating.  I had a very good experience with this drug.  I was suffering from ringworm covering over 20% of my body (calculated using methods for burn victims).  It was this way for two years.  I tried every natural method I could in that time in utter desperation and finally decided that I would go to the doctor and suffer the consequences if need be.  Anything would be better than scratching myself to a pulp every day.  I had blood drawn to test my liver (I am in very good health otherwise)_ and the results showed that I could probably withstand the drug.  The doctor told me not to drink_ so I didn't.  Not a drop of alcohol for two months.  One week after I started taking the tablets_ most of the visible affects of the fungus had disappeared.  I still seemed to feel a ""twinge"" of itchiness after one month_ so I requested another.  I haven't really had any problems since.  There was one minor relapse I took care of with antifungal cream. I hate resorting to Western medicine. Believe me--I am no shill for this drug_ but I have to say it was my miracle pill. I would advise anyone in the same boat to try it.

I ended up soaking my feet in 16 oz of vinegar along with at least 25 oz of water every day for 6 months and my feet are like brand new. Soaking your feet in Vinegar and water will work for anybody and when I say anybody I mean anybody. If you are using Lamisil_ STOP using it immediately the side effects are not worth it. Soak your feet in VINEGAR/WATER!!!!!! it will work.

Total of 5000 mg was in my system over a 2 and a 1/2 days. 10 capsules out of 30. It took 40 days after I took my last capsule for the side effects to finally wear off thanks to drinking at least 2-3 gallons of water a day and pissing the nasty medicine out.

I stopped taking the lamisil 6 weeks ago today and the rash is worse than ever despite treatment_ I feel like ripping my skin off. My taste is slowly returning_ I have eaten 2 full meals this week for the first time in 8 weeks. I have been living on sustagen. I lost 11 kilo's in the first 4 1/2 weeks after losing my taste and subsequently my iron levels got so low my doctor was considering a transfusion. I couldn't walk up the stairs in my house without becoming dizzy_ my legs cramping and out of breath. I could barely look after myself let alone my 3 kids.

They should use this drug as a weight loss pill too. I have lost weight_ thank you. Any other side effects I had were mild and went away. Just keep yourself hydrated and take a multi vitamin. If you are dizzy it is probably because your blood sugar is low_ have a slim fast.,F,41,  1X D,9/12/2010,Lamisil at

Holy cow_ I never realized how many people were effected BADLY.,Had a toe nail infection on my big toe_ for MANY years..ugly!! Then it spread to the other toes on the foot_ that foot was always dry and cracked_ red and AWFUL looking. Well now it looks BEAUTIFUL after only 1 month_ my toe nails are looking great again_ already- wish I could stop taking it to avoid these scary poissible side effects I am reading about here!

135, 1, toenail fungus,Lost my sense of taste,"It took me a couple weeks before I actually associated the changes in my taste with the Terbinafine.  It was a very subtle and slow loss of taste for me.  When I realized that water was tasting nasty_ I did some web research and discovered that ""taste disturbance"" is a known side effect I stopped taking the drug immediately.  I had taken the drug for 65 days when I quit.  At that time_ I could not see any difference in my infected toenails.  Everything taste the same and has a waxy texture.  Even water now has a texture to it.  It has been only 2 weeks since I stopped taking the drug.  Some foods have become totally unedible for me. I am distressed after reading all of the entries on this site about how many months have passed and some people have not recovered their taste.  The web research indicated only 2% of people taking the drug had a taste disturbance_ but it appears like a lot of the respondants on this site have had that effect.

After 3 months treatment_ and counting_ nail looking much improved for 1st time_ and wearing sandalls again. As terbinafine potentially toxic to liver_ I cut out all additional liver stressors_ such as coffee_ alcohol. I also went on total sugar free_ gluten free diet_ which I believe has improved my total health_ and minimised the side effects of terbinafine. Yes_ terbinafine is toxic_ but so is long term exposure to fungus (which is NOT only on your toes.)There are many medications pre-disposing one to fungal development_ many of which I unfortunately had in the past.I hope my lifestyle change can prevent a re-occurance.

137, 1, toe nail fungus,"This medication should be banned.  Several months ago I noticed an area under my big toe nail and went to my family doctor.  She confirmed a fungus and perscribed Lamisil.  She said she has perscribed this medication to many patients and that it is safe.  She did do the right thing by requiring liver function blood work initially and at 2 months.  My followup was last week and the liver tests came back normal.  Last week I started noticing my sense of taste was ""off"" but didn't know it was related to Lamisil.  By last weekend my loss of taste was driving me crazy.  Like many here have noted_ sweets taste awful_ fruit is yucky. Most sweets taste like they have artificial sweeteners_ and I can't stand that.  I have been surviving on hummus and carrots_ granola and skim milk and some soup.  I've lost 4 poinds in one week (I can afford to). My mouth always has this dry_ salty_ metallic taste.",Yesterday I went to my podiatrist and he performed the first of three laser treatments on my toe.  I am hopeful that this will rid me of the fungus.  My case is not severe as it only started in April.  He also suggested that I take Milk Thistle_ a natural herb that is a detox for your liver.  He said it may help speed up the process to get my taste back and rid my body of this horrible medication.  I am so fearful that my taste will not return.  I too am a foodie and my friends and family always look forward to my cooking.  Not only do I not feel like cooking any more_ when I do cook_ I have no idea if it is any good.

My podiatrist and GP told me it should take a few weeks for my taste to come back.  I couldn't believe how much the loss of taste affected my life.  I was truly depressed (which I have never been before).  I found that vegetables (cherry tomatoes_ carrots_ cukes) tasted OK and skim milk was somewhat normal.  I went for a physical and my liver tests were fine.  I vowed that if my taste came back I would write so that someone else going through this would have hope.  Well_ its just a little past three months since I stopped taking lamisil and my taste is coming back.  Sweets still don't taste normal but I can enjoy most foods.  I find that mixtures aren't great but pure foods are tasting pretty normal.

149, 1, Toenail Fungus,This Drug is EVIL!!!  Do not take no matter how bad your fungus is!  It has totally disrupted my life for over 3 months now!  Initial side effects included:  Loss of Taste - - Weight Loss - - Severe Allergic Reaction - - Hives - - Severe pain under ribcage - - Swelling and Pain in All Joints - - CONSTANT VERTIGO for 10 weeks even after discontinuing use.  Immunologist diagnosed me with as having an AUTO-IMMUNE-RESPONSE caused by Lamisil.  My symptoms were so bad she diagnosed me with DRUG-INDUCED-LUPUS.  Even after Lupus symptoms subsided the constant Vertigo continued.  Ear Specialist verified that severe allergic reaction caused by Lamisil is responsible for an enormous amount of fluid in my inner ear which triggered the vertigo.

The second_ I experienced slight nausia and anxiety_ but I also had a VERY stressful experience with a different matter. I also had strange nightmares_ bad enough for my fiance to wake in the night and shake me from it. I also experienced a bit of appetite loss. Since then I've noticed progressing gland soreness in the back of my neck and slight pains at the base of my skull_ extreme thirst_ slightly frequent urination_ slight headache_ and a bit of bad gas. I'm almost wondering if mixing with large amounts of coffee is a bad idea. These are very minor side effects_ even tolerable...so far.

I was also training for a 1/2 marathon so I wasn't sure what to blame the tiredness on (training or drug).  After about 4 weeks starting losing sense of taste.  This has been extremely disruptive to my life as I'm a big foodie and love to cook and eat.  Mouth tastes like I've been sucking on salt.  Only very strong flavors can be noticed.  I can still smell but my mouth feels horrible.  Also noticing some stomach cramping.  My primary doc ordered liver tests and they came back fine but this is not at all what I was expecting.  Dermatologist who put me on this drug told me to go off it at once_ once i reported the lack of taste stating that it could become permanent if I continue it.  SCARY!!!!,"I was initially very hesitant to go on this drug but once it was offered cheaper in the Terbinafine_ I went on it after trying a very strong perscription for a ""toenail fungus paint"".  That showed little to no improvement after 6 months and I was very distraught with the looks of my nails. I have the fungus in 5 of my 10 toes.  My nails are starting to look a lot better but I'm fearful that the fungus will now return since I was not on the drug for at least 12 weeks  (more like 7).  I did occasionally have a glass of wine and this didn't seem to matter much but it didn't taste as good as I would have liked.

As far as my toenails go_ I can see a small margin of healthy nail starting to grow in_ and it looks great!,Although I have been feeling good_ I do want to mention one side effect that I experienced.  I am taking birth control pills along with the Lamisil_ and I experienced a lot of breakthrough bleeding during my first month of taking Lamisil.  I've never experienced this before.   Because the main components of birth control pills are broken down by cytochrome P450 in the liver_ AND Lamisil inhibits cytochrome P450_ it makes sense that taking Lamisil would affect the metabolism of hormones in birth control pills.  This would also explain the breakthrough bleeding that I experienced. I would suggest that other women taking both BCP and Lamisil concurrently use an alternate form of contraceptives while on Lamisil.,F,26,45  days250 mg 1X D,3/22/2010,Lamisil at

I later developed a very itchy and unsightly rash in my groin area which I have had for a few weeks now (I am in my last week of 3 months of daily lamisil).

173, 1, ,Loss of taste,A possible tip for eating with taste loss! I think I've found a way to cope better with this awful side effect and wanted to share.  I've been off the pills for about 10 days with almost complete loss of taste - very upsetting and unable to hardly eat anything.  The other day I made a roast dinner (my fave usually) took 2 bites and had to stop as it was so disgusting (not my cooking!) Today however I decided to try a bit of the left over chicken and could detect a slight chicken flavour.  I focussed in on the flavour and managed to eat several pieces.  I think that the shock of losing my taste means that my brain registers the loss and the metallic taste first and this drowns out the little flavour I can detect.  My suggestion is to eat one food at a time and consciously focus in on any (nice) flavour you can taste.  It isn't a cure but by doing that I've managed to eat chicken and a home made (liquidised) soup.  For the last 10 days I've only managed ready brek and banana whizzed up with milk.  I hope it helps other sufferers,F,35,35  days,1/13/2010Email,Lamisil at

I took the treatment for 30 days and handed the Lamsil back to the pharmacist. if i had taken this for the3 full 180 days I would have been very ill.NEVER take this drug. I am a very fit person normally_ and this drug reduced my ability to work. In fact_ i haven't completely recovered even after two years later. Lamasil should be banned.,M,59,120  days,12/22/2009Email,Lamisil at
177, 1, Mild Toe Nail Fungus,After 30 days of being on 250 mg/day of generic Lamsil_ noticed bad taste. Discontinued taking Lamisil 3 days later_ not knowing for sure if it was due to Lamisil. I can hardly eat or drink - food_ water_ everything in the mouth is hardly tolerable.  I keep searching for something that I can eat that will taste normal.  Sweet food is especialy repulsive.,I did not realize that lack of taste was even a side effect of taking Lamisil.  The patient should be warned of this before taking it and really should be taken off the market altogether. I would like to know the experience of others as to how long it took for taste to return to normal and what_ if anything_ they did to help return their taste to normal.,F,65,33  days,12/20/2009,Lamisil at

179, 1, Fungal treatment,Nose bleeds (no previous history of this)_ blood platelet count reducing. Fatigue and dizziness.,The side effects are comparable to WARFARIN side effects.

182, 5, Toenail fungus/cracking feet,None,I've had the nail fungus on 3 toes on each foot for about 20 years and have tried everything to get rid of it.  Even the bottoms of my feet were infected and would crack and hurt when I walked.  Even worse was the embarrassment to wear sandals_ go swimming or walk on the beach.  I finally decided to try Lamisil about 65 days ago_ so only 3 weeks to go!  No side effects_ even though after reading all of the posts_ my mind was playing tricks on me_ making me believe I had various problems.  After about 30 days_ I noticed the bottoms of my feet were clearing up and no longer cracking!  I was even experiencing skin peeling between my thumb and forefinger that drove my wife nuts_ since I had a habit of peeling it off...and that completely cleared up also!  So_ those two problems alone has made the choice well worth it!  No more soaking and scraping my feet_ which only helped for a few days.  As for the nails_ I've noticed they are finally starting to show a little clearing on the big toe nails_ nothing yet on the small ones.  I'm so excited about this_ I've even dreamed of them being clear!  Sorry to hear about the many problems so many are facing_ but I honestly feel those are very rare side effects of the medication and if you experience them_ immediately stop taking it_ as with any medication.  As for attempting to persuade others to discontinue use of Lamisil and they could possibly benefit from a problem that has caused so much embarrassment and shame...is just not right.,M,47,65  days,11/11/2009,Lamisil at
183, 1, Toenail Fungus,Yes_ at this moment I am experiencing the rash some other folks are talking about. They haven't itched much .....yet. Stopped taking the lamisil medication after 23 days_ and if anybody has a recommendation to get rid of the rash I'd appreciate it! :) Still don't know how long it will last and WILL leave a message for my doctor describing the side effects and asking for a remedy for the rash. I would have hated to have taste-loss- that's one of the worse.   danno6466@yahoo.com,Never use it.,M,43,23  days,10/25/2009Email,Lamisil at
184, 3, toenail fungus,serious taste disturbance. My mouth became severely metalic after one month; I stopped taking the drug 6-7 weeks ago and most food is STARTING to taste somewhat normal_ except for sweets_ which still taste bitter and metalic.  AND THE HOLIDAYS ARE COMING!,"I have lost 15 pounds due to this taste issue and am very suprised at how it's impacted my life.  I am a major ""foodie"" and love to cook_ eat and talk food. My doctor didn't seem to be aware of this level of reaction and really doesn't know what to tell me.  I've started a 'pulse' regimine of one week on/three weeks off and am just praying my very slow taste return isn't halted.  And like I said_ sweets are still horribly bitter and metalic.  The big 'HOWEVER_' is that it really has worked on my nails_ which is why I don't want to stop taking it completely.",F,50,35  days,10/22/2009Email,Lamisil at
185, 4, ,Toe nail fungus,I took the generic Lamasil for 90 days and experienced no side effects... didn't even know there where all these negative effects. I also drank in moderation over the 90 day period with no trouble. Nails are starting to look better_ but I hear it takes six months to completely clear the nails.

I know the answer and I hope you do to!! Do not take lamisil!!It ruined 3 months of my life! It is not not worth the risk of having horrible side effects-fears mentally as to what is happening to your body and an overall horrible spaced out feeling--I lived with this toe fungus for 20 years and I wish I decided to live with it for the rest of life!

Switched to tabs which i barely get a metal taste in my mouth so far (only 3 days with the tabs),so yeah the cream_ and I used alot all over my feet and nails_ made me itsch and itch like crazy. I didnt realize this could possible happen. As it turned out I went to the dr to get the RX tab so realizing the itching was from the cream (1%) that i just started to take_ and the itching/sensitivity has gone away. Will let you know about the generic tabs.,M,40,3  days,7/5/2009Email,Lamisil at
197, 1, Toenail fungis,I took this posion for three weeks after the end of the second week I noticed everything tasted funny.  Then I started to have terrible nausa and could not eat or drink without feeling like I was going to vomit.  I am loosing weight and I'm very tired my gut has an awful pain in it.  If I do eat only the first bite am I able to taste a little and swallow.  If I continue to try to eat I have to spit out what was chewed or I will throw up.  My mouth is constantly saltly tasting and discusting.  Even if I brush my teeth it still tastes awful.  I can tolerate water with the juice of half a lemon if it's very cold and I drink it fast.  I can barely taste fresh basil and spicy food but the stomach pain prevents me from eating.  My doctor took blood from me last week to test liver enzymes I have already stoped the drug. I am very concerned about my health I have lost 10 lbs in three weeks.  I would never reccomend this drug to any one loosing your sense of taste robs you of any pleasure in ea,It seem the people that have the taste distribance are at a higher risk for liver damage because of this drug.,F,52,21  days,7/4/2009,Lamisil at

I am on day 10 now of horrible pain where I sit and the above and will remove myself from this medicine immediately. I will post a follow up here if indeed it is the Lamisil.

A week and a half ago I totally lost my appitite_ have a VERY dry mouth... even after taking a drink of water I am very thristy again.  I try to eat everyday but can't eat things that are dry because they become hard to swallow because of the lack of saliva.  Also have had loose stool_ with some yellow watery discharge_ ben VERY anxious... I have alreay lost 10 pound and I am skinny to begin with.  I went to the DR and all my liver functions and blood tests came back good.  Could this possiably be caused by the Lamisil.

200, 1, Toe nail fungus_ mild_,I don't ususally trust what I read on the Internet. So_ I can't believe it_ but yes - I lost my sense of taste at about 6 weeks. It's still faint_ tasting as though I mixed the food with a heavy paste. I do taste very salty things_ but it only registers as the salt. I immediately stopped the medication. My liver panel was normal at one month on meds - will check it again in a couple of weeks. I would not take this medicine again. I had tried the topical_ prescription strength anti-fungals_ but to no avail. Hopefully there is a newer_ more palatable option out there.,,F,48,42  days,6/15/2009,Lamisil at
201, 1, toe nail fungus,loss of taste/feeling of having lumps in my throat,sudden loss of taste at about six weeks of taking medication.    I can't imagine not being able to taste food again.  Does anyone know how long these symptoms last??  Wish I would have never taken this medication.

202, 1, Finger nail fungus,After living with a disfigured and mostly absent finger nail for over 10 years I finally decided to give Lamisil a try.  I've taken the generic version for 5 weeks now.  I developed itchy patches all over my body after about a week.  A steroid shot seemed to clear that up.  Then at 4 weeks in I lost my sense of taste.  Everything tastes horrible!  I've already lost 5% of my body weight and I'm afraid that will rise.  I'm discontinuing the medication!,,F,37,35  days,6/3/2009,Lamisil at

204, 2, toe fungus,I am not a person who ever has reactions to anything.  I don't have allergies and I'm very healthy.  So when I got the info sheet that came with the drug (generic - Terbinafine) I pretty much ignored it.  When_ at about day 25 into my 90 day prescription_ I started to itch_ I thought it was dry skin.  Then the itching turned to rashes on different parts of my body.  When one went away another appeared - on forearms_ calves_ even the bottoms of my feet.  It didn't seem it could be due to the meds because of the time that had passed.  Then_ around day 29 I started to have muscle/joint aches and brief swelling of my ankles that would go away and return.  At that point I found this site and reports of so many similar symptoms.,I will stop the drug.  I could live with the symptoms for 60 more days if I knew that was as bad as it would get and that they'd go away after stopping the drug.  But after seeing the loss of taste and other symptoms people are reporting_ I'm not willing to take the chance.  Thanks to all for the warnings.,F,46,31  days,5/1/2009,Lamisil at

206, 4, toe fungus,had horrible indigestion the first 2-3 weeks_ but that quickly subsided. Continued to drink alcohol occasionally.,I'm on day 75 of the 90-day treatment. I was terrified of taking this medication after getting on this board_ but I haven't had any problems. They say it can take up to a year for any signs of improvement to the fungus_ but I can already tell a difference in the look and feel of my toenail. (Just in time for summer! Thank goodness!) While I believe this drug to be highly powerful and believe the side effects many people are reporting are real_ I think if you need to take this drug to get rid of a fungus_ you should do so. Just monitor yourself very closely while on the drug.,F,32,75  days,4/23/2009,Lamisil at
207, 3, left thumbnail fungal infection,"I'm at week 7 of 250mg once a day. First 30 days everything was fine_ then I started with welts on my chest_ shoulders_ arms_ legs and back.  The medicine seems to be killing the fungus_ but the rash is really itchy. My GP assures me the rash isn't from the anti-fungal_ but I know better.  Before taking the drug my left thumb was in bad shape - cracking and bleeding from the slightest bump_ ugly_ black raised nail with a foul odor.  I'm going to see a dermatologist to see what I can do about this problem.  I hate taking this drug_ but there is no other way to get under the nail and attack this horrible fungus.  My thumb is much better and now it looks like if I can continue the meds it will kill the fungus.  This isn't a cosmetic problem_the fungal infection was really nasty.  I have always been a ""health nut"" and think my superior diet and avoidance of alcohol_ drugs_ chemicals and crappy food has helped me to avoid many of the side effects other have written about here.

I have found that thinking about the pill too much is what's causing the problem_ so I take it at night_ with some milk or a light snack. I did notice I do get a little spacey_  but only when I first take the pill_ and I just sleep that off. I can't wait to see the positive results_ and don't let all the negative hype scare you.

212, 3, toenail fungus,no taste,Three years ago I noticed that all food tasted bad.  The only thing I could think of was that I was taking lamasil.  I called my doctor and he was confused and not aware that it was a side effect. I quit taking lamasil.  I am a pharmaceutical sales rep so I knew to look at the side effects and saw 3%.  Three weeks ago I went to a new md because I moved and was fed up with my yellow toenails and I told her of my losing taste with my last trial with lamasil....again she said that she had never heard that this was indeed a side effect so I thought that perhaps Lamasil was not the cause of my previous loss of taste.  Well I was wrong and 4 days ago lost about 80% of taste...I am actually eating papa johns pizza with the butter sauce right now hoping that I would at least taste a part of the rich taste...it tastes like crap.  I dont know if I can go another 2 1/2 months of this but on the other hand I dont want yellow nails so i am going to try and stick it out.  But the good news is that I can tell you that you will get the taste back...I dont remember it taking that long...probably about a week after I discontinued treatment.  Wow...the simple things we take for granted.  My father is taking it right now as well and he tastes everything.  Everyone acts differently to all medications...we are just the unlucky 3% :-( Good Luck!!!!,M,31,20  days,3/30/2009Email,Lamisil at

214, 1, fungal infection-toe,I didn't observe any change in the toe nail but about six weeks into treatment I noticed my taste had changed dramitically.  I had difficulty with mild flavors like yogurt and even felt my coffee tasted different.  My dr. told me to discontinue but after several weeks_ my taste was still effected. The dr. and pharmacy has heard of this side effect but basically said there was nothing they could do about it. My dilemma is that I find it hard to believe that  (according to Lamiail info) only 3% of the population have this neg. side effect. So many people taking this product have had similar sidde effects. Personally_ I would rather taste food and use a home remedy like vinegar on it.  Is there an independent study that could be done to determine the real results?? I am very dissatisfied with the results. I've also complained to the FDA--basically didn't get any satisfaction from them.,,F,65,30  days,3/15/2009,Lamisil at

216, 1, toenail fungus,altered taste,I've NEVER experienced side-effects from ANY drug befor ethis one_ so I was quite surprised when my taste suffered major changes suddenly at 4 3/4 weeks. I have a terrible taste in my mouth at all times_ water tastes horrible_ EVERYTHING tastes horrible. The major problem is that I still get hungry_ and I can still smell food properly; also_ the most tolerable foods are either extremely spicy (but taste mild)_ or typically high in fat (like cashew nuts for some reason taste bland_ but not like crud)so I effectively haven't even lost weight like some other posters. Socially_ this is miserable- not just because people have no idea what impact this side effect has. Today is my last day -I'm quitting a week early- and I'm hoping that my taste comes back- I LOVE cooking_ so this is unbearable to me. I'm very sad and scared about this.,F,37,42  days,3/9/2009,Lamisil at
217, 1, Finger nail fungus,It was only after about five weeks into a six week course of treatment that I noticed that sweet things didn't taste the same.  Very shortly after that_ I lost all sweet taste and all the food I ingest tastes like what I would imagine sawdust tastes like.  There is no joy in eating. I can discern a few tastes_ principally lemon_ lime_ peppermint_ parsley_ cilantro_ etc.  But after a few bites_ there is no taste at all. I love to cook and I can't even try out new recipes because I can't taste them.  What a way to live.  I don't wish this on anyone.,"If you are thinking about taking this drug_ THINK HARD.  If you have never suffered from this side effect_ you can't really appreciate what it is like not to be able to taste.  I have lost 5 pounds so far and have to force myself to eat.  I was so naive to just take a drug prescribed by a physician and not do research on it beforehand.    The ""possible side effects"" described by the manufacturer are very understated.  Almost like_ well_ there is a possibilty but it's very rare.  I would say that it is not that rare from what I read here. You have to be your own advocate.",F,59,45  days,2/26/2009Email,Lamisil at

219, 1, yeast infection,My whole body stunk like something rotton. My hair began falling out and what was left felt like cotton candy. It's been two years and my hair still feels like cotton candy. I don't think it will grow back either. Sorry for all of you looking for reassurance. I think the lamisil burned out some of my hair folicles or something. I think this drug needs to be banned and those suffering lasting effects should be compensated.,My sister lost quite a bit of hair about 15 years ago. I mentioned to my sister that my hair was getting thin. Without her knowing my situation_ she told me that her hair not only fell out but also felt like cotton candy. I told her mine did too and told her that I was on Lamisil and attributed the problem to the Lamisil. Then_ surprisingly_ she told me that she had been on Lamisil when all of this happened to her! I couldn't believe it! This drug has been causing people's hair to fall out for years and it's still on the market! ,F,49,90  days,2/17/2009,Lamisil at
220, 4, toenail fungus,Extreme fatigue_ tongue felt swollen off and on.,Wasn't sure if the fatigue was a result of the drug or just life_ 3 days off it and I'm back to normal.  I would drag myself out of bed and through the day and head straight to the couch for a long nap when I got home_ spent weekends in bed--killed the fungus and my home life.  If you're gonna take this drug--take it when you have a lot of down time.  I lost a lot of weight sleeping through dinner_ napping at lunch--I didn't have it to lose.  Drink a Lot of water--the tongue swelling feeling seemed to coincide with being dehydrated as my need for fluids seemed to go way up and as long as I was drinking gatorade and water ALL day--there were no issues.  Every 2 hours I chugged a 32oz bottle of one or the other and I don't typically care for either_ but the thirst would be incurrable and my tongue would feel swollen the next day if I didn't.

221, 1, Toe Nail Fungus,I took this for approx 3 1/2 weeks_ then seemed to lose taste and stopped medicine.  I've been off medicine for 1 1/2 weeks and still no taste.  Not just no taste but when I start eating anything_ after a couple of bites_ it starts to taste worse and worse.  I have absolutely no taste when brushing my teeth.  Water tastes like metal and I have a constant bad taste in my mouth.  Sometimes it makes me feel nauseous.

I stopped taking it as soon as I found this website and read about the side effects. It has now been 12 days and I still cannot taste anything_ especially sugar and vinegar! I also have a salty metal taste in my mouth all of the time. My doctor had never heard of this happening to anyone! I hope that it is not permanent!!

224, 1, toe fungal infection,Loss of taste at day 34.  Took drug for 36 days because couldn't get hold of Dr. due to holidays & then talked w/ pharmacist to see if I could stop immediately w/out further problems.  Have constant salty taste in my mouth. Either everything tastes foul_ salty or no taste but yet w/ an underlying sludge taste making most foods and drinks completly repulsive.  Eating a sandwich w/ meat_ I can only take one or 2 bites before I have to throw it out_ it is so disgusting.  Have also become constipated but probably due to non tolerance of liquids & my current limited diet.  I used to drink a lot of water & now I can hardly stand the amount of water to rinse my mouth after brushing my teeth.  The worst is sweets_ particularly chocolate which I dearly love.  Dairy & most fruits are bad. One thing that did actually taste good was a Confederate Bean Soup that had smoked sausage in it.  I could tolerate a a pork roast only because it was served w/ a dried fruit compote & the c,DO NOT TAKE LAMISIL!  It's just not worth it!  I didn't know about these side effects going into it & when I did read the pamphlet_ it said it affected only 2-3% of the poplulation which doesn't seem to be the case for the people on this site.  One person on this site did write to the drug co. that responded that 90% of the people get their taste ack in 12 weeks or less and 10% will take a little longer but overall couldn't give any time frames.

She advised me to take kittens to vet. Vet did a black light test on them and they were all bright green. He gave them  a treatment and they all died overnight. The next morning my skin doc called me in PERSON! She and her skin doc hubby were very concerned. After initially telling me that lamisil was too invasive for treatment_ put me on it immeadiately. It was the answer to my problems. The terrible skin issues which had even gone into my eyes were gone quickly.

228, 1, Toenail fungus,"I went back and forth about taking this medication until my pharmacist told me he took it with no side effects - my doctor said there might be mild side effects but most people reported none... I said to heck with it and began a 12 week treatment.  No side effects during the first four weeks.  On the fifth week experienced nausea and extreme itching.  Itching was so severe all over my hands and wrists swelled from the sratching. Then I woke up one morning and opened a can of sweet ice tea which I love but I couldn't taste the sweetness - it was like water - everything went downhill from there.  It's been two weeks_ I cannot taste anything sweet.  Most food is blander than bland or very salty.  Nausea is almmost constant_ even after drinking water (also very nasty)  My mouth has a constant salty ""taste"" in it and I am miserable!  I stopped taking the medication as soon as this ""taste disturbance"" occurred and notified my doctor.",I believe the medication should undergo further testing and that the side effects more clearly defined - this is not just a taste disturbance - this is extreme.

Possible rare SLE Lupis SIDE EFFECTS! Still have the nail infection.,Live with the nail infections.  If I was aware of ALL the side effects I never would have taken this medication.  I have been in good health my entire life_ hardly even sick with a cold.  Now I am looking at at least six months of slow recovery and drugs to try and correct my present situation.  My problem is that people are not given all the necessary information by the drug company about ALL the possible risks.  My doctors were also unaware of these side effects and confused by my conflicting test results.  Thanks to a concerned friend this situation was brought to light and hopefully the proper steps are being taken to bring about a full recovery.

I took my last tablet today_ Christmas eve_ what a Fantastic Christmas gift. I kept off alcohol and caffeine for the entire duration of the course and intend doing so for another month at least.

My toenail fungus that I've had since I was 14 is gone and the athletes foot that I've had since I was 5 is also gone.  I've battled athletes foot all my life and have been embarrassed to ever wear open toed shoes.

My toe looks better and doesn't hurt anymore_ but my insides are so messed up and hurt really bad_ I ended up in ER_ they didn't find anything_ had CT-Scan everything appears to be fine_ but I feel horrible.  I called my podiatrist and he recommended that I take one one day then skip a day_ or break it in 1/2 and extend my treatment time_ but I've heard way too much bad_ I'm going to discontinue it_ it's not worth the pain and nausia_ it's effecting my work and other activities.,F,23,2.5  months,12/17/2008Email,Lamisil at

237, 1, Toenail fungus,After 6 weeks of taking this medication I noticed that everything I ate and drank tasted odd.  I contacted my doctor and stopped taking Lamisil immediately upon discovering that loss of taste or taste disturbance was a side effect of this drug.  I contacted Novartis customer service department who refused to discuss my concerns saying it was against their code of practice!  They agreed to write to my doctor to give him what information they had about this side effect (and then had the nerve to ask if he would pass on my medical history so they could put me into the database!  I refused).  So I have been told it should take about 6 weeks for my taste to recover.  But 6 weeks has been and gone and I still have major taste disturbance.  It has gone from a mouthful of sea water to a mouthful of soapy water!  Nice!!

Ouch!,I wanted to write a review after a successful use of this product because I believe that the majority of people who write on these boards are unsatisfied users and the satisfied users typically do not come back to share their results. Now_ this is a very serious drug and should be taken with precaution and discretion. But not all experiences are horror stories_ so here is mine_ I had fungus on my right big toe ever since I can remember. Like most_ I was embarrassed to show off my toe and was envious of everyone that could. I wanted to get rid of this unwelcome guest and was convinced that topical treatment could not effectively do the job. I decided to use Lamisil and I have to admit_ it worked!  And no_ I am not in any way a rep for this product. It took 6 weeks to visibly see my new toe coming in_ and about 5 months to have a normal_ pink toe.

The taste of coffee_ pizza and steaks is like rotten mushrooms.  Some taste like lemons and oranges is discernable.,Has anyone successfully recovered from the taste/smell loss?  Has anyone done any type of detox to help the recovery?  is there some natural way to cure this malady.  I do not recommend this for anyone unless you are aware of the chances that it may fail you.  The sad part is that I used to be an excellent cook and I cannot even make a decent cup of coffee or smell popcorn!!  I would rather have my toenail removed and have a fake one......

It's been a horrible experience for her so far_ to not be able to taste ANYTHING.  She's lived on chicken nuggets for the past 3 weeks.  She's lost weight and she's depressed.  I think that comes from not being able to taste food and fear that it may never come back_ you just eat to get strength.  Its comforting to know that most of these people at least got SOME taste back in about 6 weeks.  Im so glad I found this page.  Its helped a lot...thank God_ since the doctors completely blow you off and have no obvious clue to this side effect.  Thats amazing since it IS like the 3rd side effect on the list.

After about 35 days into taking the medication_ I noticed a change in my sense of taste.  At first_ I wasn't too sure what was happening. I also noticed that I was always thirsty even though I drink a lot of water already.  I also noticed a metalic after taste in my mouth.  My stomach was a bit queasy at times and I found myself very tired. My doctor and pharmasist did not warn me about these particular side effects at all.  When I started doing more research on the drug and I had realized that other people were describing the same symptoms and more_ I decided to stop taking the medication.  It is not worth losing all sense of taste over toenail fungus.  I looked into homeopathic remedies and one of the things that was suggested was to soak your feet in epsom salt once a day.  It may take a while to get rid of the fungus but it is worth a shot.  I can always cover my toes with toenail polish.

The toenails are starting to look normal_ too_ pinker than before_ and they seem to be growing in less thick and nasty.  For the first time in years I've been able to wear sandals without embarrassment.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has had severe problems with toenail fungus and athlete's foot.,F,36,27  days,6/18/2008,Lamisil at
267, 1, Fungal toe nails,Severe taste disturbances_ weight loss_ fatigue_ headaches_ constipation_ depression_ back pain,side effects emerged after 5 weeks of taking tablets. Stopped medication immediately. I had a metallic_ bi-carbonate soda taste on tongue. All food tasted repulsive_ even water. My social life was effected and I felt very depressed. I managed to drink smoothies made with milk_ honey_ banana_ vanilla essence_ & ice. I could tolerate porridge for breakfast. A naturopath gave me some herbal drops and my taste started to return 6.5 weeks after stopping tablets. This has been the most miserable time of my life and ruined an overseas holiday. Lamisil should not be on the market. It is a poison. BEWARE!!!!,F,54,5  years,6/3/2008,Lamisil at
268, 3, Toenail Fungus_ both feet,Headaches_ Kidney Inflammation_ metallic taste_ pale stool,I noticed the headaches and pale stool within a week or two of starting generic lamisil.  However the headaches were easily manageable with painkillers_ and the pale stool simply had my doctor order blood tests. After a month or so I noticed the metallic taste and some abdominal pain that would subside a few hours after taking a pill. In the final two weeks of a three month course of treatment_ the abdominal pain got worse and I was forced to stop taking any doses.  I am awaiting the results of new blood tests on my kidney function. In the third month I could see the start of clearer nails growing in.  I am hopeful that the nail will continue to grow this way now that I have stopped taking lamisil.,M,27,75  days,6/2/2008,Lamisil at

272, 1, toe nail fungal infection,About two and a half weeks after starting the drug I broke out in HORRIBLE hives all over my body.  My hands and feet swelled up (it became painful to walk as the soles of my feet hurt so much).  I also had random joint pain in my knees_ elbows_ fingers and toes that would last a day in each location then move somewhere else.  There was also a couple days of severe heartburn_ chest pain and some stomach pain.  It was awful.,I have been off the dug now for three days.  The hives are getting better but the joint pain is still quite bad.  The swelling is starting to go down but is not gone yet.  This was really awful - my Doctor told me it was a food allergy and totally dismissed the idea that it could be the Lamisil and told me to keep taking it.  The hives started to subside the next day after stopping the drug.  This whole experience has been very frustrating.,F,33,20  days,5/25/2008,Lamisil at

That week_ while out of town_ I suddenly lost my sense of taste.  I had my liver tested_ luckily_ with good results.

I think my treatment is 12 weeks_ or 84 days. I have been taking for 54 days_ and trimming the two nails and filing about every month. They are growing out very slowly. But it does look like they are growing out pink now at the very base of the two nails. I am excited about that! The only thing is that summer is almost here_ and I probably still won't be able to wear sandles through the summer becuase it takes so long to grow out. It doesn't clear the nail that is there_ it just starts to grow out clear. I am giong to have blood work done again in a few days_ but I want to finish the pills.

I am prone to depression_ but this was horrible_ unlike anything I'd ever experienced before.  It's been a little over a week since I stopped taking Lamisil_ and all my symptoms have improved_ but I'm still going to get my liver checked.This drug is POISON -- STAY AWAY FROM IT.,F,43,45  days,10/23/2007,Lamisil at

315, 1, Nail Fungus,I didn't notice any side effects.,I've tried 3 courses of Lamisil over a period of 3 years. One for 2 months and another for 3 months. I've just stopped the third course (of 6 months) after 3 months as it is having zero effect on my nail situation.,M,39,6  months,10/5/2007,Lamisil at
316, 4, Taking it for ringworm.,It caused nausea_ dizziness_ and after only 4 days of using the cream_ I experienced great fatigue and mood swings. I have real dark circles under my eyes from fatigue_ and sleep too much. Nasty metallic taste in mouth_ but still taste foods ok.,I am not using the cream anymore. Only used it for 4 days_ but the strange taste in my mouth and the fatigue and dizziness are warning signs of the onset of something worse. Thank God I didn't take the pills_ and tried the cream first. It did a great job of clearing up the ringworm. Too bad the side effects are so bad. I wouldn't reccommend this product to anyone. If you can't taste anything_ what good is life? Better to live with the fungus_ as I see there are worse things that can happen.,F,51,4  days,10/2/2007,Lamisil at
317, 5, toenail fungus,slight headache at beginning_ couldn't drink alcohol_ needed to drink more water than usual,it's three months or so since I stopped the Lamisil after a course of six months and nine of my toenails are normal - one_ the worst_ is not bad. I CAN WEAR OPEN TOED SHOES IN PUBLIC FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TEN YEARS! My liver tests were normal at all times.  I want to remind people_ though_ don't touch alcohol while on this drug - I drank a single half glass of wine while on the drug and it was entirely the wrong thing to do. Also_ remember that caffeine reduces the effects. I took my Lamisil and a single cup of coffee a day - at opposite ends of the day.,F,49,6  months,9/24/2007Email,Lamisil at
318, 1, Toe Nail,Almost complete loss of taste after about 7 weeks on Lamisil.,After 3 weeks of no taste_ I tried taking Acidophilus and a holistic liver cleansing solution.

320, 1, fingernail and toenail fungus,After taking the drug for about 2 weeks I noticed shortness of breath_ hot flashes_ a few chest pains_ throbbing headache.  Luckily for me (from what it sounds like on this forum) I still have my sense of taste and my liver seems alright.  In any case_ I've been taking for about three weeks and after reading about everyone's experiences I am going to discontinue this crap.  It's amazing how many frequent unrelated side effects a drug for nail fungus can cause.  Ban this crap before it hurts more people,It works_ but I honestly don't care.  I would never recommend this to anyone.  This drug is meant for cosmetic purposes_ buts its side affects are immense.  This just shows how thorough the FDA is.,M,20,3  weeks,9/11/2007Email,Lamisil at
321, 1, Ringworm,Loss of taste_ Very salty mouth.,I was taking Terbinafine (Lamisil) for 4 weeks for ringworm.  It must have been 6 weeks since I finished the course. It has left me with a very salty taste in my mouth and food tastes awful.  I went back to the doctors and she gave me medication for oral thrush.  It obviously wasn't thrush as that was almost 3 weeks ago and I have still got the awful taste in my mouth. This symptom really does make you deppressed.  I wouldn't advise anybody to take this awful drug. An oral spray is helping me at the moment_ it gives my taste buds something to taste. Has anyone got any idea how long it will take to get back to normal?,F,50,4  weeks,9/3/2007Email,Lamisil at

The flakey skin on my feet has fully disappeared. I found that if I drank lots of water I felt better-I haven't had a drop of alcohol. I'm not sure if I will regret taking the Lamisil 2 weeks less than prescribed.

324, 5, fungus on my toe nails,Into my 2nd month_ stomach pains a couple times_ nothing major. My heart beating very fast(maybe 2 or 3 x's_ but i suffer from panic attacks)_ so_ I think its not from the drug. Nothing that I felt very alarmed at though.,I noticed a change(as crazy as it may seem)_ the very first week of taking it.  My toes already look AMAZING. I am SO HAPPY.  I could never show my toenails before_ now I do.  My husband never even knew what they looked like because I hid them from him at all times with socks on.  I have been blessed to say that I haven't experienced the loss in taste or sweets.  I'm addicted to sweets and still am.  Maybe that would have been a blessing if it were lost(wink_ wink).  But honestly greatful and thankful that I haven't gone thru any horrible side effects as some have.  I just recommend that people really question their doctors about everything_ though honestly_ i didn't_ my brother took it_ he was fine with it and so I did. Again_ it's worth it for me_ as I'm sure_ it hasn't been for others.,F,48,43  days,8/20/2007Email,Lamisil at
325, 4, Scalp Ringworm,None that I am fully aware of.  I have a slight rash on my neck_ but I'm not sure that it is from the Lamisil.  I also have some itching in other parts of my body_ again_ not sure if that's the meds.,I was taking something called Gris for scalp ringworm. I was on it for 3 months but the ringworm was not clearing fast enough (I had bald spots and some of them had not grown much hair) so my dr. decided to put me on Lamisil. He checked my liver and kidneys and when they tested fine he prescribed the Lamisil.  Its been 3 weeks (I had my liver tested again a week ago out of paranoia and it's fine) The spots are starting to show more signs of hair growth so I think that's a sign the Lamisil has helped take up where the Gris left off.  I guess it's unusual for lamisil to be prescribed for scalp ringworm_ but I wanted to post this because this had been the most frustrating experience I've gone through may help someone else to know they just have to be patient and hang in there.,F,48,3  weeks,8/18/2007,Lamisil at
326, 5, Fungus on fingernails and toenails.,Slight fatigue.  When I first took it I had some nausea_ but I'm not sure if that was related to the lamisil.,I had suffered from fingernail fungus for ten years_ which was not only unsightly but painful:  my nails would catch on things and pull and bleed.  Lamisil cleared it in eight weeks!  My doctor didn't even advise a blood test_ since it's recommended that you test after six months and I wasn't on the drug that long.Also_ I don't drink at all_ ever_ so I was less worried about liver effects.,F,33,8  weeks,8/16/2007,Lamisil at
327, 5, Toenail Fungus,In the beginning I had some minor chest pains but only for 2 days then disappeared.,"Don't be afraid of taking this drug_ it was tested for years on hundred's of thousands of individuals before coming out.  ""Changes in taste perception_ diarrhea_ loss of appetite_ nausea_ stomach upset_ or vomiting. As your body adjusts to the drug terbinafine_ these side effects should diminish or disappear."" ~ as they did for me.  Take it for more than a week or two before you make a decision to quit_ it's definitely worth not having disgusting looking toe nails anymore (which I had for 5 years before taking the drug).  I've already taken the drug for 4 weeks and plan on taking it for the remaining 8.  Also I have drank alcohol one day out of each weekend (maybe 5-6 drinks the nights that I drank)_ and taken a blood test every 2 weeks since I started taking the drug which checked my liver enzymes.  Each test resulted in a perfectly healthy liver.  Good luck you guys.",M,23,4  weeks,8/2/2007,Lamisil at

The doctor told me it was a really good medicine and she did not have any problems with patients who had taken it.  I can't believe the lack of follow up and the fact that I was not told the possible ramifications. I have been vacinnated for Shingles and no mentioned the/a connection between Lamisil and Shingles.  Some of these hives look like a combination of Shingles and Hives. I was prescribed with two oral medications and a topical cream.  After one pill and several applications of the cream - no relief - the hives are climbing up my neck towards my chin - they are already on my face and all other parts of the body. I took this advice(take Lamisil) because I am pre-diabetic and concerned  about nail infections etc. When I suggested Penlac the dermatologist said ""Nothing works except Lamisil.""",I would not recommend Lamisil to anyone!,F,63,28  days,7/31/2007,Lamisil at

Maybe that I had got a drier mouth. ,One thing that I have been very strict about is not to drink ANY alcohol during this time. This is a tough drug for your liver_ so I rather stay off my beers then get a messed up liver.Will stay of alcohol for a few weeks after I'm done as well. only have a few weeks to Go. I'm VERY happy about my results. I had nails faling off my fingers and they hurted like hell_ now 2 month into my treatment_ my nails are coming back and I'm very pleased with the result so far.

My sense of taste did change slightly and still has not completely returned to normal after not taking the medicine for a month.  I do believe it was well worth it because my nails are almost completely normal even though it is supposed to take up to a year to completely grow in new nails.  I can go get a pedicure now.....but I don't recommend it because you can get an infection there too!  Many are not as lucky as I have been and have had serious side effects.

It lasts for about two hours and then goes back to normal. Like everyone else here_ it's some sort of metal taste. Pretty unfavorable. I've decided to hang in there. I have another 5 weeks to go and if nothing else is going to add to the current discomfort then it's worth the effort in my opinion. What I read_ the taste will return.

HE IS STUBUBORN-MINDED_ HOWEVER_ THERE IS A REMEDY THAT WORKS AND DOES NOT REQUIRE TAKING MEDICATIONS. (SEE COMMENTS),AN ELDERLY RETIRED PHARMACIST SUGGESTED AN OLD REMEDY:  DIP THE INFECTED TOE(S) INTO PURE (UNDILUTED) BLEACH_ COUNT TO FIVE_ AND LIFT IT OUT. PAT THE EXCESS BLEACH OFF AND LET THE TOE AIR-DRY.  FOLLOW-UP DAILY BY TAKING A STRIP OF COTTON FROM A COTTON BALL_ SATURATE IT WITH RUBBING ALCOHOL_ AND TUCK IT UNDER THE NAIL_ AROUND THE CORNER AND DOWN THE SIDES OF THE NAIL_ PRESSING IT BETWEEN THE NAIL AND THE SKIN AS FAR AS YOU CAN.  LEAVE IT THERE UNTIL YOUR NEXT SHOWER_ THEN REPLACE IT.  THE BLEACH DIPS MAY NEED TO BE DONE MORE THAN ONCE IF THE INFECTION IS SEVERE OR WIDE-SPREAD.  ONCE IT'S UNDER CONTROL_ TO PREVENT RE-OCURRENCE_ YOU'LL ONLY NEED TO DAB ALCOHOL ON THE TOE (UNDER AND AROUND THE NAIL); LET DRY_ THEN APPLY TOPICAL LAMISIL UNDER AND AROUND THE NAIL AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TINGLING OR 'ODD' SENSATION.

I did not immediately think it was caused by the drug. I thought it could be due to stress or allergies to my cats_ although I had not previously experienced anything like this. I determined it was probably due to the Lamisil after realizing nothing else had changed except my ingestion of the drug. I felt exhausted and very strange. After reading this website and the comments posted_ I stopped taking the drug immediately and am researching alternative natural cures.

I was not able to sleep because I could not find a comfortable position my shoulder hurt so much. The pain radiated down my arm and was made worse by PT and massage therapy. I was miserable.

419, 1, Toe fungus,I broke out in hives after 3 weeks on Lamisil.  My lips started to swell_ I had hugh hives all over my arms_ legs and face and I itched like there was no tomorrow.  It was well over a week after stopping the Lamisil that the itching got better.  Seems like side effects are commom with this one.  I am debating on trying Sporanox but am concerned I will face horrible side effects again.,,F,38,30  days,6/22/2006,Lamisil at
420, 2, Ringworm,Slowly helped original spots_ but_ didn't stop new ones from coming.  I now have over 130 spots and have been using lamisil cream for 38 days now.  (I shower twice a day and put the cream on after showering.  My bed laundry is also changed daily)**********************************My new approach will be to go the herbal route.  I'll be taking glyconutritionals.  Using fresh garlic in my meals.  Adding a good acidopholis_ extra vitamin C and_ some MSM for inflammation.  I'll also take some milk thistle to mitigate any damage/if any to liver from my 2 days on the tablets. The herbal route can't be any worse.  I'll still use a topical.  Half my body will get clotrimizole and the other half will get tea tree oil.  Might as well see which is more effective.,"Lamisil AT is the topical cream_ yet everyone here seems to be talking about Lamisil 250mg tablets instead of the cream. (this page is for Lamisil AT cream) I did 2 days of the tablets and stopped out of fear of the side effects. Only 2 days and my healthy areas of skin started itching like crazy today_ just before it was time to take my 3rd tablet. The severe itching makes me fear continuation of the tablets.  I'm stopping them.**********************************Anyone interested in seeing how my new method works is free to contact me next month.

421, 1, Nail fungus,My wife has been taking this medication for about three and a half weeks. Everything was fine for the first couple of weeks and then those nasty side effects started to occur. She started experiencing anxiety_ depression_ nausea_ diarrhea_ bloating_ no appetite_ and loss of taste.,Really talk with your doctor about this medication.

422, 2, Toe Nail Fungus,Loss of taste_ blurred vision_ slight bloating.  I have stopped taking this after my 3 month prescription was nearly through. I am still waiting for my full taste capability to return to normal. Very difficult drug for the body to handle.   The claim of a 2.8% rate of taste loss appears bogus and should be investigated by the FDA immediately.,I am apparently cured_ but my advice would be; A. Find an alternative method of treating the fungus including applying Vicks Vapo Rub or Menthol based medicine to the nails early when you first notice a possible fungus;  B. Monitor liver functions closely if you do decide to take this drug. C. Again_ if you decide to take this drug and are even a moderate drinker; stop intake of any alcoholic beverages for the length of the prescription+.Taking this drug is a heck of a price to pay  physically  and financially  for the ability to wear sandles without imbarrasment.,M,43,85  days,6/11/2006,Lamisil at

Took Lamisil patient Prescription Information and asked if I could be having a reaction. She assured me I was not having a reaction that I had what appeared to be insect bites and gave me 1% cortisone creme. She did not inform me of possible side effects and gave me a prescription for Allegra to take during the day and Benadril at night. I went to Novartis web site and didn't read any of these side effects. In searching the internet for anything on Lamisil I found this site. This is a horrible period to experience and I am not sure whether I can indure to  complete the 90 day treatment or not. I am about 45 days into treatment. Now I wonder if I will ever be back to normal? It took three biopsy's before one came back Fungus. Prior to that no one knew what was causing trouble with nails.

I stopped taking the Lamisil immediately it happened.   After 8 days I am still completely unable to eat anything at all and it is very difficult even to drink water which tastes revolting.  I manage to force down enough water to survive but am feeling very weak_ ill_ cold and tired and am unable to go to work. Drinking a glass of water makes me weep. I hope I will be able to eat and drink soon because otherwise I will just be a skeleton.

434, 5, Nail Fungus,I really didn't experience any major side effects.,Lamisil worked great for me.  I took it for 90 days and after completing the medicine I started to see results. I had fungus on 7  of my 10 toes and all but my 2 big toes have completely grown back healthy. The 2 big toes are almost there. I recommend this for anyone who has nail fungus and no serious illnesses. I understand people are experiencing problems and side effects but everyone is different and it works differently with each person.  Dont bad the drug just because it doesnt work for you.,F,31,90  days,5/17/2006,Lamisil at
435, 3, nail and foot fungus,i had only one side effect--INSOMNIA. This drug made mefeel like I was on speed. Tons of energy_ couldnt sleep. I had to reduce. First I cut tablet in half_ then fourths_finally eighths. If i take more than i/8 of a tablet I cannot sleep 8 hours. I have read all postings and do not see one single other person affected in this way. But i tested_ on and off and there is no doubt--lamisil works like speed for me. BTW_ yes_ my taste also reduced_ but mildly. However I am now on 1/8th. I wonder if it can cure fungus at this low dose or if I should just forget it?,took off and on for about 3-4 months,F,42,3  months,5/6/2006Email,Lamisil at
436, 5, Toenail Fungus,Always tired.,I began taking these pills and after 5 days_ I couldn't stay awake at all.  I did some research on the net and found some natural solutions.  I file my the top of my nails at least once a week until I get to the fungus.  Each day I soak my feet in Hydrogen Peroxide.  After that_ i soak my feet once more in Apple Cider Vinegar_ dry them and topically apply Oil of Oregano in the morning and once again in the afternoon.  To avoid the side effects_ I ground up the Lamisil pills and mixed them with a little water and applied this topically at night.  Hey_ I'm no doctor_ but this is working for me.  It seems as if the fungus is just disappearing.  Not even growing out in the form of a new nail_ just disappearing.  I think that it's mostly the natural remedies that are curing me and it may even be a waste of the pills to grind them up_ but I didn't want to throw them away.  Talk to the doctor before you do this_ but for me the natural way works the best_ and there are zero side effects.  Good,M,26,30  days,4/30/2006,Lamisil at

I have been off Lamisil for a week and still no change.  If I had known about this side effect_ I would have never taken the drug.  I hope that I can taste my toothpaste in the morning.

The stomach cramps were unbearable_ and I think I'd rather live with a nail fungus than suffer 90 days of this. I found this site because I was researching what side effects may be_ as I was told that this medicine was WELL TOLERATED! Not according to anyone on this site!

Side effects of Celiac Disease: poor digestion_ diarrhea_ flatulence_ severe rash.,For the price of this medication_ I expected the fungus would be cleared up in both toes.  Since starting Lamisil_ I have continued the upset stomach and diarrhea side effects and have been diagnosed with Celiac Disease.

Unfortunately_ my MD didn't inform me that I had to go another 30days after the first.  The fungus came back.  The second time I started treatment_ my taste was all out of whack. (and I love food! LOL) The taste in my mouth got so bad_ and I got so frustrated_ I had to stop.  I noticed a HUGE improvement in my one affected toenail though.

However_ the treatment worked! My nail infection was moderate - but half way thru the 90 day treatment I could see the nails clearing - and now_ three months after ending treatment my nails are completely clear! I'm no longer ashamed to go barefooted & I'm being careful to prevent reinfection. Also_ the stomach problems slowly cleared up within two months after ending treatment.

I stopped the drug at that point. Wish I had known about this Web site - I wouldn't have worried so much. About the only thing I could stand eating was spicy meat - beef slathered with horseradish or hot wings (and I don't normally eat anything spicy!).

447, 1, Toe nail fungal infection,HORRIFIC SIDE-EFFECTS.  Hives which covered all my body apart from neck and face_ followed by skin peeling. The peeling was literally like stripping wallpaper (not just holiday sunburn)and also affected my whole body apart from face and neck. This lasted for weeks and I could hardly use my hands or walk as the soles of my feet were also covered in the rash.  My ankles and feet became very swollen and I was unable to wear shoes.  I was referred to a specialist at the hospital.  This all went on for approx 8 weeks and just as the symptoms were starting to improve_ I got shingles.  The specialist said it was probably due to the sress and confirmed that the symptoms were an allergic reaction to the Lamisil. To make things worse the hospital took a nail sample and I didn't even have fungal infection!!  The problem has now cleared up by itself.,This drug is VERY DANGEROUS and should be banned.,F,52,9  days,4/5/2006,Lamisil at

By 6 weeks I had lost almost all sense of taste and have a constant metallic taste in my mouth.  I stopped taking it on my own 4 days ago and so far nothing has changed.,If I had been warned of the side effects_ I would have never taken Lamisil.

452, 4, toe nail fungus,at first there were no side effects but after taking lamisil for about 30 days I started experiencing migrating pain from my hamstring and inner thigh through my knee joints and down to my ankle.  The pain was not consistent in location or intensity but as a result was unable to go on hikes or walks without considerable pain.  I took the drug for 3 months beginning in June and then stopped because the Doctor believed the dosage in my system was adequate to resolve the fungus in 4 of my toenails.  During the period of pain I was unable to find any type of  over the counter pain reliever that would help.  I sought a Chiropractor thinking the pain in my leg was from a nerve pinch.  Didn't help.  Now after 6 months of being off lamisil my toenail fungus is almost completely gone and my leg pain has diminished to almost nothing.,No other side effects except the leg pain.  Don't know if I would do it again.  Sometimes the pain was so intense I would wake up in the middle of the night.,M,58,90  days,3/4/2006,Lamisil at

461, 5, Toe Nail Fungus,For the first couple of days taking the Lamisil pill I experienced mild headaches and a local skin rash.  Both cleared up within a week.  Since then no side effects.,This is my 45th day (January 19_ 2005) taking Lamisil.  As per my doctors orders_ for one week before I started the first day of therapy I completely cut coffee and alchohol from my diet and have also tried to get an extra hour of sleep.  He told me the reason for both of these is to ease the workload on my liver.  He also suggested cutting the nail back as far as I could in order to expose the residue beneath_ and also rubbing the exposed residue on my toes with 99% rubbing achohol every night before going to bed in order to kill any spores on the surface.  I have followed these instructions to the letter.  Two weeks ago I had my follow up liver test and everything was ok.  The fungus in my nails has actually started flaking away and my new nails have started growing out.  For the first time in 20 years my feet are starting to look normal.  45 days to go.....I will let you know how it goes.

Have a blood test and if all is well start taking drug and take another blood test 30 days into drug.  2nd test was fine.  Very soon after that taste loss occured.  Had I realized this side effect I would not have taken the drug.  Stopped taking lamisil 1 day ago and am awaiting taste to return.  Hopefully it will return quickly.  Unless the condition is extremely bad I would not recommend taking this.  So glad I found this site.

I'm now near the end of my 90-days of Lamisil AT tablets and ringworm is GONE_ athlete's foot is GONE_ toenails only slightly better but I understand it takes time for them to grow healthy. We'll see. Not sure yet if it's related to the Lamisil_ but I'm active and I've ALWAYS been able to drop weight easily...15 pounds in a month was always a piece of cake...but haven't been able to drop ANY weight at all since starting on Lamisil.
