6, 5, Depression and Anxiety,None,Wow!  This is the wonder drug.  It reminds me of things like dicyclomine...drugs that actually work and work well.  This drug has helped me sleep night after night.  Improved my serotonin uptake and mood with zero side effects whatsoever.  They tried Celexa and Zoloft on me.  Celexa made me crazy sick after 2 doses.  Zoloft was not bad in terms of mood support but really noticeable urinary urgency and sexual side effects at just 50mg.  Zero weight gain_ BUT I already was on a very disciplined low sugar_ high protein/fruit/vegetable diet. So_ I have had none of the craving issues that some complain about.

Why im concerned and disatissfied is the relentless over the top nightmarish dreams and even auditory hallucinations the wake me up in the middle of the night...it startle me rather!

24, 4, Insomnia_ depression,Grogginess_ vivid dreams & restless sleep during dose ramp up_ but this is better now. Agitation_ increased anxiety_  and headache at 30 mg; these went away when I lowered my dose to 22.5 mg.,I worked slowly from 7.5 mg to 30 mg in 7.5 mg increments over a 2 week period. After a week on 30 mg my doctor agreed to try a lower dose (22.5 mg)_ which is more tolerable for me. I was too agitated at the higher dose. Luckily_ I have not experienced an increase in appetite or weight gain (perhaps a few pounds_ but I lost a lot of weight during my descent into depression). My mood is much improved (I was suicidal just three weeks ago)_ and my sleep_ energy and concentration are also improved. I read many negative reviews of this drug_ and like many others I was nervous about taking it (this is my first time on an AD)_ but my experience has thankfully been positive. Let the medication do its thing_ and titrate up slowly to find the right dose for you.,F,50,4  weeks22.5 mg,10/2/2015,Remeron

27, 2, depression/anxiety,Trying to taper off this drug from 45mg to 30mg. When i first started on it at 30mg i got very irritable and angry. Increased to 45mg because of chronic anxiety. All i can say is that it didn't do anything for me infact i think it made me worse. The plus side is that it did make me sleep at night but also made me incredibly sleepy during the day. Im now suffering with continual itching and a welt like rash_ i can only put this down to remeron. This med is also used to increase appetite_ mine is non existent and made me feel nauseous.  I just hope the next lot of anti-depressants im prescribed do a better job,,F,48,8  months45mg,8/5/2015,Remeron

Dr. had me take senna laxative.  did not work and was afraid to take any more for fear of another drug reaction.  had a skin reaction (mild SJS) to oxcarbazapine 6 months prior.  Emotionally I was very agitated for about 1 week after stopping.,Dr. prescribed for weight loss_ 25# lost w/o reason in past yr.

Feeling very tired and dizzy. thankfully i only take it for sleep.My anxieties have subsided the last couple days as well. Although_ i want to be isolated more_ there are moments i want to do more as far as moving around goes_ which is a plus. Alot better than Trazadone.

31, 2, anxiety,Extreme hunger,Didn't work on my anxiety or depression_ was so hungry it made me preoccupied with food. The one good thing was having deep 10-12 hour sleeps especially at 7.5 mg. Was told to wait it out but I eventually refused to continue because the extreme appetite and weight gain was contributing to my anxiety! I can still take 7.5 mg only as needed as a sleeping pill but I don't often because of the appetite side effect.  Changed to Wellbutrin which works much better for me without those side effects.,M,34,2  months7.5-15 mg,5/15/2015,Remeron

Anxiety and panic_ hallucinations at night when trying to sleep. Purplish visuals and weird tactile hallucinations. Headaches_ depersonalization_ suicidal thoughts_ itching skin_ muscle jerks and twitches through body while seated. numb emotionally. Increased anxiety which led to hypochondria and self harm. Parasnomnia_ and SLEEP PARALYSIS Every morning.,Was given for MDD and Insomnia_ was started at 15mg for 3 months then bumped to 30mgs for 9 months and taken 45 mg for 2 months_ tapered off this stuff slowly_ if not done correctly you will get brainzaps_ sick feeling in stomach_ headaches/migraines_ insomnia is bound to happen considering the sedating effects of this medication. Don't know why I was taking this considering I was going crazy with all the weird rashes it was giving me on my face and since it made me have worse anxiety I was thinking I had HIV and got tons of blood tests done in a weeks time_ having stopped the medication.. I am finally feeling normal_ not soo much anxiety anymore_ insomnia yes.. but it was hard to sleep on this stuff anyway considering the vivid dreams and hallucinations of demons and shadow people and SPIDERS.

34, 5, Depression and sleep,This is an update.  I went off Remeron a few months ago and boy did I mess up.  I had gained a lot of weight with Abilify and Remeron.  Am also on Brintellex_ Ambien_ Xanax_ Adderall.While off Remeron_ I had to increase my Xanax_ start taking Ambien_ and started noticing my Adderall didn't work much. Became depressed and had problems sleeping  I noticed I started taking more Xanax to sleep and Ambien didn't help (for 3 hours maybe).Yesterday I got the Remeron filled (odt).  Took one last night (oral desolving tablet) and sleep great_ had a dream_ and woke up bright eyed and bushy tailed!I have been on numerous antidepressants and it seems like Remeron is the one for me!  Taken with Brintellex and Abilify_ I know I can function where I need to be.  Otherwise it seems life sucks being depressed_ no motivation_ anxiety.  ,Love it but don't like the weight gain.  I have lost some of the weight I gained before and will keep  watching my diet and working out.,F,51,1  days15 mg odt 1X D,4/22/2015Email,Remeron

36, 4, Depression and anxiety,Drowsy and tired during daytime. Increased appetite. Slightly restless legs_ but only directly after dosing so was gone by morning. Some numbing of emotions_ so this can have negative effect on relationships with people_ prefered being alone tbh. Thoughts not clear. With reading_ for example_ sometimes the I just couldn't absorb the meaning of words and had to read lines several times. This was also partly because of reduced concentration. In a lot of ways it improved my cognitive abilities and memory. Just didn't feel sharp.,Probably the best antidepressant I have taken (and I have taken most). Biggest problem was tiredness in the day. Took this while at university and for the most part it made my time there more challenging. However it wasn't all bad. At times I wasn't tired I felt very motivated and driven_ always wanted to be doing something. Used to spend hours playing my guitar_ worked out a lot and liked to do little projects. This is something I haven't found with any other medication (except perhaps Nortriptyline_ but that screwed up my memory). Only sad thing for me is it doesn't seem to work anymore_ have gone back to it a few times but can't seem to get that original result I had for about 6 years. Didn't help my anxiety at all btw_ probably made it worse_ but no antidepressants have helped with that. It made me feel less social_ I'd rather be working on something by myself. I also had no problems stopping it so can't really understand some of the other extreme comments_ of course everyone is different. The difficult thing with this_ in fact all these meds_ is it takes about 3 months to get used to it and for it to get up to full benefit. It's a gradual improvement that takes place.,M,33,6  years45mg 1X D,4/8/2015Email,Remeron

The side effects started to wear off around 2pm.Took a half of the 15mg the 2nd night. Slept great again. Side effects weren't nearly as bad. A shower_ cup of coffee and walking around caused the effects to wear off before noon_ as well as taking my Adderall.Taking a whole 15mg tonight just to give it another chance.(Normally I take 30mg of Tamazepam at night which helps with sleep sometimes.

48, 1, Chronic Insomnia,For the first three years_ I didn't have side effects. I gained about 4 pounds. It helped me sleep. The past two years were increasingly difficult_ violent nightmares_ horrible and muscle pain. My Dr. didn't think it was the remeron_ but he was wrong_ it was the cause. I chose to go off the drug and it is a living nightmare. The first week was fine_ I slept pretty well_ didn't notice much difference. But one week into it_ everything went haywire. i couldn't sleep or if I did for a few hours I couldn't stay asleep. Terrible allergies_ hot flashes_ abdominal pain. My guts were like cement. This lasted about a month and I spent a lot of time in bed. The 2nd month had all the withdrawal symptoms except abdominal pain. Ginger capsules helped with that a lot. Now its been about 10 weeks and I'm down to insomnia but not nearly as bad as previous. I regret staying on the drug so long and would never recommend taking it.

Strong erections.,This is a good drug if you have problems sleeping and/or are underweight. I gained twenty pounds in five weeks. I had to stop taking it because it made me feel very heavy. It made my joints crack constantly. It made my muscles feel like they were burning whenever I stretched. I couldn't run because of the joint pain in my knees and ankles. When getting up from the sofa or going down the stairs it was as if I were 80 years old because I felt so stiff with joint pain. It didn't give my sex drive a boost but my erections were stronger than when I wasn't taking it. My mood never lifted. I really liked it at first but after a while the constant hunger becomes annoying. I slept like a baby on it_ though. 8-10 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night. I can only recommend it to those who can't sleep and/or are underweight. Other than those two things_ it did nothing but make my body sick.,M,42,5  weeks15mg 1X D,11/10/2013Email,Remeron

Only should be used very short term to help you sleep_ it causes all sorts of horrible problems which go unreported because drs will try & tell us we have a hundred other health problems which are unrelated to Mirtazapine when they definitely are! I'm coming off them but the withdrawal is BAD! Drs lied about that part. It has taken 6 months so far and I am almost off them! I really hope the horrible side effects go away soon after I stop because otherwise I may lose my job.

75, 2, Chronic_ resistant depression,Strange_ sleep disorders_ such as hypnogogic hallucinations and yelling out in my sleep which would freak out those around me...only one of two drugs to do this to me (the other being Manerix).  Generally feeling like a slug which resulted in eventual weight gain,"Let me preface this review by saying that my case is not typical since I've suffered from depression and anxiety for most of my life_ and it has become more resistant to treatment since I hit my forties.  So I tried Remeron_ hoping it would be effective since it affects both serotonin and norepinephrine and has a unique method of action.  Well the results were less than stellar_ even at the high dose_ it didn't really seem to help my mood at all. I didn't get the dreaded weight gain until I'd been on it for several weeks...which is usually the reverse of what happens but it wasn't that bad so not everyone will gain weight.  I just felt apathetic and lazy which is probably the reason for the weight gain more than anything else.  As mentioned it occasionally gave me some freaky effects while on the verge of sleep which was reason enough to discontinue it. I even tried it in combination with Effexor....the so called ""Rocket Fuel"" combo without much success.  It could be I didn't give the combo enough time in retrospect...As far as it being more activating at higher doses_ that was not the case for me as it never made me feel energized and I could have easily slept well into the afternoon.

I felt numb to any kind of other emotions such as happiness. I then got angry and felt destructive .. I ended up breaking over $6000 worth of my belongings being on this medication and almost arrested. I had contacted my doctor before the outburst and they told me to go to a walk in clinic_ I also called after the outburst and got the same answer .. I felt extremely alone at that point and refused to continue taking it. After taking it_ I finally felt guilt for the outburst and honestly mortified ! I do not recommend anyone taking this. It can cause some serious side effects so_ unless you are being observed by a doctor and monitored 24/7_ don't take it.

84, 5, insomnia,Drowsiness_ but that's what's intended. An hour or so after taking this med_ I will want to eat lots of sour candy. You will literally eat sugar out of the bag. I do not think this has caused me any weight gain_ as this effect does NOT carry over into the morning/next day. For me_ it's an inducer of a mandatory midnight treat_ but that's all. I am skinny by nature_ and have remained so on this drug.,Give this med a chance_ it's disguised as a really nasty side-effect-laden drug at first_ but give it at least a week to get past it's initial nastiness to judge if it's right for you. I felt like an absolute apathetic zombie the first two days I took this med (just 15 mg at the time). It was all smooth sailing after that though. Excellent sleep med after trazodone pooped out. It takes about an hour to hit me. I still need to take an SSRI for anxiety -- the remeron alone wasn't enough. An SSRI + Remeron may be a good combination for treatment-resistant depression. Does not cause sexual dysfunction like other AD's (specifically the SSRI/SNRI class of drugs). Buproprion is the alternative (may actually be sexually enhancing). Buproprion is the antithesis of remeron in terms of sedation/stimulation though.,M,22,5  years45 mg 1X D,4/14/2013Email,Remeron

But_ that was only because I felt NOTHING. I literally felt numb_ and when I wasn't feeling numb_ I was feeling self-righteous anger.

It takes a while to really get the full effect. No drug is a wonder drug. Everyone's body is different. I stopped having really crazy dreams after about 3 weeks. Weight gain- well I have gained 10 lbs in a year. It does slow down your metabolism_ but with proper diet and exercise_ you should be fine. I am in the military and in the healthcare field_.so I was pretty well informed about the side effects. This drug_ like any other is not one to be judged in a week or two. Like other antidepressants_ it takes 2-6 weeks to really get your body adjusted. My advice_ if it still doesn't really work after 2 months_ then try something else.

It really save my life since I was unable to work_ anxiety ridden_ suicidal_ unable to sleep or eat _ exhausted and nauseous and throwing up every morning. I was also reluctant to go back to prozac and it numbed me emotionally. With this drug I got my sleep and appetite back_ and the depression lifted enough that I could function- while at the same time being able to experience a normal range of emotion from sadness to joy. During this year I did have a few depressive episodes but adjusting the med helped ( I went back and forth between 15 and 45 mg with my  psychiatrist's indications). It's amazing to sleep again_ to eat again and not to wake up as if you're on plane that's crashing. Was able to resume yoga practice and that has also helped immensely. My main issue is I've piled up weight_ and that is crashing my self-esteem_ so my psychiatrist has reccommended wellbutrin.

I began anti-depressants for the first time in my life because I was having severe panic attacks and my mental health was deteriorating fast. My symptoms  of depression were loss of appetite_ just wanting to sleep_ loss of interest in life_ didn't want anyone to visit me_ anxiety so bad I was crawling out of my skin. After beginning the med- It took about 2-3 days of severe tiredness and wanting to do nothing but sleep. On the 3rd day- I was discharged from the hospital- and my friend bought me a drink from Planet smoothie and ate a piece of pizza. I was so grateful to desire food again. Before that i was just eating peanut butter and drinking gingerale and could barely stomach that. It did have an effect such as ""having the munchies"" but for me this was good at the time. I noticed an improvement of mood_ and a desire to get out of bed and face the world. It also helped my IBS symptoms (stomach).

107, 5, Anxiety and depression,Started with 30mg. Heard it was bad for weight gain_ so I was VERY careful the first couple of years. The weight gain did catch up to me_ however.Never found it made me tired (at night). I thought this drug was a miracle for my depression and anxiety. I took it at night_ slept through the entire next day_ and woke up a new man.Also_ no negative effects on libido.Alas_ after 11 years_ and up to 45 mg_ it just isn't working for me any more_ so I need to find a new anti-D.,Whenever I missed a dose (not often_ but...) or changed doses_ I would have to start again on a Friday because I could sleep thru a Saturday. Again_ though_ the following day_ I was good as new.I came to this site to find out if anyone has been having memory problems with long term use of Remeron (brand). If anyone has_ or has some interesting info to offer_ I'd like to hear about it. As I said_ I do have to find a new med_ but an 11 year run with no libidinal problems_ I think_ is damn good.,M,53,11  years30 MG 1X D,5/28/2012Email,Remeron

109, 5, Bipolar disoder,Knocks him out_ and increased appetite.,This medicine has helped my fiance so much I had to share. He was on zyprexa but when it went generic it was just to expensive to buy. He would throw up multiple times a day from his stress level. This medicine stopped the throwing up completely. He was at 122 at 5'11. In the last month hes gained 15lbs. Maybe thats not good for everyone but for someone who couldn't eat and would throw up like he was from the stress he felt its been an amazing blessing. He no longer has psychosis symptoms either. Everyone in his family says they have never seen him so healthy_ even on the zyprexa people thought something didn't seem right but now everyone would describe him as normal. This has been a miracle medicine and I hope it continues to work so well.,M,27,30  days30 1X D,5/17/2012Email,Remeron

115, 5, Insomnia & Anxiety,1st year gained about 10 pounds and had all of the other minor side effects. Augmented an ssri (prozac) with it for awhile. It's effective for ssri side effects (sweating_ insomnia_ also.),My body must have gotten used to it over time because this drug continues to help my sleep and concentration. I have taken brand tablet_ brand soltab_ & every generic available. I stopped for about 6 months and did not die but I missed it. I recommend using Wiki to read about how it works. It is no worse than ssri side effects or withdrawal effects. I don't drink and every year my liver is fine. 15mg a night always works & 1 last thing_ brand IS stronger otherwise Teva & Greenstone are good generics. Sandoz & Auerobindo not as good.,M,37,12  years15mg 1X D,4/26/2012,Remeron

117, 5, PTSD_ and nightmares,Weight gain_ no dreams,I started it because I couldn't sleep I was having nightmares constantly. My past(Iraq) was comig back to huant me two or three times a week. I actually lost 50 pounds in three months_ my doctor thought I was dieing_ I've gotten back 35 of it so far_ though not as in good of shape as I was. I feel better my wife says I act better I have motavation to live and go_ where I didn't before. One downside is if I miss one dose the nightmares will keep me up all night_ random one at that. Also I don't dream at all anymore. I used to have fantastic dreams and even lucid dreams. Now I take my pill and go into a coma for six hours. But I'm ready for the world when I get up. I went a four day period with none because my doctor refused to fill it until I saw him. It was four days of hell.

Don't know if it ever helped my anxiety (and new depression)_ certainly not good now.Pros: Improved sleep most nights. Fewer digestive disturbances (diarrhea and stomach pain).","I have been stable at 135 pounds all of my life until I took this drug. The first night (!!!) I took it_ I dreamed about Cocoa Puffs cereal all night_ and awoke ravenous. I was too doped to drive_ tipping over when I tried to move_ but even in that state I begged my husband to drive to the grocery for me. I wolfed down half a box of sugary cereal as soon as he got home. The doped feeling went away within 2 days_ but now I am always hungry_ and constantly craving sweets. (I never went for sweets before.) I am now at 148 pounds_ and freaked out that I can't lose any of this weight. This overweight person in the mirror is me! I can't lose it_ I even tried to reduce the dosage on my own to make it easier to lose weight_ but MISTAKE. Out of nowhere_ can you say DEPRESSION???Has anyone else had a side effect of getting overheated to the point you can't function temporarily?

122, 5, poor sleep_ anxiety,very groggy in the AM initially.,I began taking 15 MG Remeron about 4 weeks ago. Before_ I was waking up every night after 4-5 hours of sleep_ sometimes less_ and not being able to get back to sleep.  The first week of taking the 15mg_ there was the hangover effect in the morning and into the next day.  I went down to 7.5MG until the end of the first week and moved back up to 15MG.   I had been dealing with the sleep problems for much of the past 10 years.   After the first week_ the hangover effect went away.  After the second week_ my sleep continued to improve to the point where I sleep throughout the night virtually every night and when I do wake_ I am able to get back to sleep.  It's only been 4 weeks_ but I can easily say that this drug has greatly helped my sleep and anxiety associated with the sleeplessness.

I took it around 11pm Friday night and was able to read just fine for an hour before falling asleep.  I typically wake at least once in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.  I woke at 6am to use the bathroom and made it there_ stumbling and was on my way back when I started feeling horribly nauseous and dizzy.  I woke my husband hyperventilating.  I made it back to the bathroom_ thought I would throw up but had diarrhea.  All the while my vision was going spotted black_ my face was numb and I could hardly move my arms or legs.  I stumbled back to bed and my poor husband had to flush the toilet.  It was embarrassing how disoriented and helpless I was.  I feel like I could barely get words out to speak to him and was very panicked.  Moderate depression I can deal with in therapy_ these side effects are NOT WORTH IT!

Remeron has been the easiest of anti depressant meds for me to take and I've been on a bunch of SSRI/NRI type meds. The only side effects I get are good quality sleep and a lessoning of my anxiety.

I'm otherwise fit_ play tennis_ yoga_ etc. but the numbness is new and I'm very concerned it may  cause nerve damage_ Have others also experienced numbness in the legs?,May be good for sleep_ but I feel often sedated and not here.

However_ roll on a few months & I then went on to experience the worst 18 months of my life. A complete unexplained deterioration in my overall health_ with all sorts of strange neurological symptoms_ & considerable muscle weakness. Things got so bad that the medics suspected I could be suffering from muscular dystrophy or MS! After some 20 months I was also concerned by large weight gain for an individual who had always been within safe weight range_ & in < 2 yrs had become clinically obese. Tests ruled out nasty muscular & neurological diseases. Concerned that drug might be the culprit_ agreed to come off it. 2 weeks after stopping the drug the tremors had ceased_ & I began to get sensation back in my extremities. After 3 weeks the horrible burning sensation in my legs vanished_ & my general fatigue began to disappear. 6 wks on_ I feel human again_ & now completely rid of all these horrible side-effects. In last 6 wks have shed 21 lbs without trying. The drug was 'sold' to me as a benign medication with minimal side effects. However_ for me it unfortunately turned out to be pure poison!!

140, 4, Anxiety,Little weight gain (10 lbs over 5 months)_ hard to get up in the mornings_ intense dreams,I started taking 30mg approximately 5 months ago with .5mg anxiety med twice a day. I was switched 45mg two months ago and only take the anxiety med every weekday morning and as needed (which has not been more than a couple times). Remeron has helped me get back to myself. I just started working out and trying to eat a little healthier in hopes of dropping a few of the pounds I have gained while taking this med. I find it difficult to get myself out of bed in the morning and have started taking the med a little earlier at night (used to take it between 10 and 10:15_ now I take it around 9:30) which has helped a little. I have really intense dreams that leave me a little 'out of it' when I wake up almost as if I am having difficulty knowing if it was a dream or reality.

It's been two weeks now on Remeron and it definitely helps me sleep through a few hours of the night (about 4 or 5) and I am rid of the constant worrying.  I have noticed some weight gain however I really watch what I eat now and it seems to be under control.  The biggest side effect that I have noticed is that when I move my eyes I get a weird sensation in my head_ almost a light-headed feeling.

I dragged myself out of bed and was absolutely NO GOOD at all the entire first day. I took a three hour nap in the afternoon. The second day was not any better. I slept through the night_ it worked great for the insominia but I can not tolerate the way it makes me feel during the day. I have to choose the lesser of two evils here- sleep through the night and  be useless during the day OR be okay during the day and get a so-so amount of sleep. I have to be alert and have to many responsibilites during the day to be in the condition this drug left me in. I stopped taking it.,F,35,7  days 1X D,8/17/2011,Remeron

I was prescribed this medication for anxiety_ panic attacks and insomnia. The first night I took it_ I knocked out for 16 hours. This drug WILL sedate you and then some. I woke up the next day feeling incapacitated. I was unsteady_ weak_ brain sick and was unable to drive. I was in fact unable to do much except sit there and stew in the awful feeling in my brain. About 24 hours after the initial dose I finally started feeling like myself again. I should've quit there but I decided to give it another go_ and took another dose. Rinse repeat. Fast forward to next day_ feeling like crap and wishing I could feel like myself again. This stuff made me a zombie and unable to function normally. I didn't take anymore after this_ and I did notice it took about 3 days before I felt normal again. Very scary stuff. There are a few positives; it will cure your insomnia FAST as it does knock you out for quite a long time. And also I noticed when I took it_ I am usually a sensitive_ insecure person who avoids rocking the boat_ but while on this I felt more confident and like I didn't give a shit about anything. That was cool_ but not worth it overall given the severe mental impairment I felt.,F,31,2  days30 MG 1X D,7/2/2011Email,Remeron
150, 4, Anxiety/Panic disorder slight depre,Slight restless legs when starting. Sweet cravings after taking at night. These subside the longer you stay on med_ super med for anxiety.,Easiest of anti depressants to start up_ I've been on a few. Sedative at 15 mg. nice anxiolytic at 30 mg. Tried relying on xanax alone to cover anxiety_ and it wasn't covering it. Remeron has been a great add on to xanax and I'm tending to need the xanax less now_ from 1.5mg a day down to .5mg.. This is truly a great med for anxiety sufferers_ it should be prescribed as a first line treatment before the more common ssris are and I don't know why it isn't.,M,35,7  weeks30 mg 1X D,6/30/2011Email,Remeron
151, 4, Stress and Weight Loss,Hard to wake up for work.  Insane food cravings.  Husband thinks I'm kind of mean and arrogant.,This medication seems to work very good when used to treat the lack of appetite I had and weight loss.  It does not knock me out at night like it is supposed to so I still take .5 mg of xanax with it.  I also take 5 mg of Lexapro in the morning.  My stress and anxiety is less now and I've been able to cope with life's problems a lot better.  I hope to get off it soon though because I'm starting to get over weight.  I don't eat healthy enough to keep taking this stuff.  My husband says I'm a bit ignorant now and have a sort of arrogance that he doesn't like.  He has nicknamed the med bitcheron...I don't have any wild dreams like others have reported.  The increase in appetite is actually unbelievable.  I EAT ALL THE TIME.  And I eat everything in front of me.  In the past_ I'd take a few bites and be totally full.  I also had quite a lot of gastrological issues before taking this and it seems as if that has gone away too.  I can drink coffee again!?!?!!,F,35,3  months30 MG 1X D,6/27/2011Email,Remeron
152, 1, For depression and anxiety,Extreme tiredness_ extreme weakness (mostly in legs)_ slurred speech_ more depressed_ lethargic_ confusion_ hard time making decisions_ slowed down and doped up (not in a good way).,I could barely walk I was so tired and weak. It was absolutely terrible. Every time I took it (at night) I would sleep for 12 or more hours straight and my husband would wake me up and ask me If I was going to get up and I would just fall back asleep immediatly. I felt catatonic and lethargic. Out of all the meds I have tried I have to put this one down as second to worst for me. Maybe it was because I don't have insomnia - I don't really have any trouble falling and staying asleep. I am also on Lorazepam 0.5 mg/1/day. Surely it works for some_ but it didnt for me.,F,27,1  weeks30 1X D,6/27/2011Email,Remeron
153, 5, Inability to eat cuz of anxiety,Dramatically increased appetite (good thing)_ about 2 months into it I began to feel manicy and disconnected_ 6 months on it and I felt drugged up.  I stopped seeing my psychiatrist but was still getting refills on this medication.  Horrible move on my part.  I'm sure if I'd had someone monitoring me I wouldn't have taken it for as long as I did.  For me_ it was a great short-term drug that helped me get the motivation to find a job and move out of my parent's house.,Remeron saved me when I was going through anxiety so severe that I went from 130lbs to 118lbs in a month (I'm 5'8'').  The day after taking it the first time my anxiety had disappeared by 75% and I went immediately to the fridge to get some breakfast!  My first days on it felt like I was on marijuana.  Even music sounded better.  I have heard someone say it is like pot in a pill_ it is!  I even looking forward to taking it because it was so nice to be knocked out for the evening_ not that I had trouble sleeping.  HOWEVER_ after 2 months I started feeling arrogant and sort of speedy and emotionally shadow.  I have taken prozac and 2 weeks later landed in the hospital for a mixed state.  Over the months (and without a doc's supervision) this feeling only worsened and I decided to get off it.  I feel MUCH better.

I have been on small dose Kllonopin for svrl yrs which take concurrently.  Tried all of the SSRI's but the sexual side effects were always bad.  I've had no urge for eating as others report. Its seems to be working for depression and obcessive_ thoughts which play into my GAD.  Three days ago Psych. upped from 15 mg to 22 mg /day.  First night at 22mg woke at 3 am went back to sleep.  Second night woke at 3 and dreamed I couldn't sleep until wake up time (buspar and neuronten similarly did this).  Third night_ slept ok through the night. Also_ it produces a pleasant feeling that comes in waves at least initially -- just pleasant.  No cognitive problems that I'm aware of.  Meant to mention its also seems real helpful for social anxiety and doesn't make you too disinhibited). I wish I had tried this long before messing around with 1/2 dozen SSRI's...

169, 2, Anxiety and Depression,extreme drowsiness_ increased hunger_ unpleasant dreams,This drug did help with my anxiety a little bit in the sense that the physical symptoms of anxiety disappeared.  I still worried as much as ever_ but I didn't get as many of the physical symptoms of anxiety as I used to such as rapid heart beat_ palms sweating_ extreme nervousness_ etc.  I honestly believe the physical symptoms only went away because my body was too exhausted to experience them.  Remeron puts you in a zombie like state.  I took it at night as directed and would be unable to stay awake any longer within 15 minutes of taking the drug.  My 2 year old son would come climb into my bed in the middle of the night and it wouldn't wake me.  Getting out of bed in the morning was next to impossible_ and I went through each day feeling like I didnt care about anything besides getting back to sleep.  Concentrating or being a good employee is next to impossible on remeron. Now the dreams....they sucked.  I had the CRAZIEST dreams on Remeron.  I would wake up just feeling disturbed and having no idea why I was dreaming about those things. Luckily_ I was too much of a zombie to stay awake and stress over them.

You can control the eating_ it is just mind over matter. Do not sit around thinking about food; be active. I am still slowly doing more increases. My sleep is usually better. I will touch base in a few more months and see how it is. Getting rid of the bad relationship I am sure has helped_ too. I have found doctors that I truly love. Get a good support system.

I went 4 days without taking it and had severe withdrawal symptoms. My anxiety shot through the roof_ shakes_ body aches_ the whole nine. I seriously felt like a crackhead.

I was able to sleep_ function and have tapered down to a minimal dose (<7 mg) at night. I previously tried Lexapro_ Klonapin and Trazodone--those drugs made me totally nuts.

I am on soc sec disability and cannot work. With my cocktail of meds_ I sleep well from 10 pm to 9 or 10am.  This totally works for me_ I get up_ I feel great_ (accept for my muscle pain from Fibromyalgia_ my Remeron was not prescribed for that). I have no appetite change or gain in weight_ I've always picked at fruit and veggies and have been thin my whole life. I can and have gone a night or two without Rem. with no problem/withdrawl. 30 ml is as high a dose as I can take and I love it! My med combo makes me feel like me. I feel level and not depressed...was never depressed.  If I take my Rem at 10pm_ and have to get up earlier...8am_ I can get up_ I am a bit drowsy_ but by the time my shower is over_ I am awake_ do my exercizes and off I go. Can't stress enough_ for those of you that are doing ok on Rem but have been taking it for a short time and questioning it's side effects or whatever you are feeling...GIVE IT TIME_ I LOVE THIS MED. My heart breaks for those that do not get the benefits of Rem_ because it is the best thing my psychiatrist could have prescribed for me_ I am thankful.

Doesn't work well when taking it on a school night because he falls asleep in class the next day.  No adverse side effects.,Actually taking the Soltab version (melts in your mouth and meant for children.)  My 9 year old was able to take the medication very easily.  Child has insomnia_ but the medication is too powerful to use at bedtime.  Have to give the medication 13 hours before he is expected to wake up the next day.  Inconvenient.  Experiences a lessening in the sleepiness if he takes it consistantly.  (i.e. takes medication but doesn't fall asleep until two hours later.)

187, 4, Depression/Anxiety,"Early in Mirtazapine therapy_ a somewhat ""out of it"" feeling along with significant sommolence and increased carbs cravings. Both these have subsided significantly.  Vivid dreams. This stuff really makes the movie machine behind your eyes run.",At the outset_ I have to say that I'm really surprised at all the negative Mirtazapine experiences reported here by others. For me_ this has been the most benign antidepressant I've ever used by leaps and bounds.  Oh well.. We're all different_ I guess.  Anyway_ I take 30mg Mirtazapine along with 3 mg diazepam daily.  Mirtazapine is the only drug that has ever worked for my depression and I've been through a bushel basket of different SSRI's from Zoloft to Lexapro to Luvox_ etc.  I could do with out the glued to the bed feeling in the mornings_  but it is a lot less than it was when I first started on Mirtazapine.  When I started_ I gained a quick 8-10 lb_ but that was the extent of my weight gain and I don't really have a daily exercise program.Additionally_ I went through prostate cancer surgery last year and I'm having enough ED problems without going back on the SSRI's_ all of which cause sexual problems. No such problems with Mirtazapine. I'm glad my P-Doc recommended it to me. It's been a big help.,M,58,1  years30 MG 1X D,10/24/2010,Remeron
188, 1, Anxiety_ insomnia_ depression,Severe drowsiness and sleepiness_ zombie-like during daytime waking hours_ explosive temper_ feel like I'm enraged every minute of the day_ severe arthritic-like pain in joints.,Have only been on this drug for 6 days and I am going to discontinue on my own.  I've felt absolutely horrible since taking this drug and it isn't getting any better.  I can barely stay awake during the day at work and am afraid it will affect my behavior at work.  Am extremely irritable and tempermental...I feel like I could explode.  I have crying jags and find myself screaming at my husband.....never had this behavior before I took this drug.

190, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ Insomnia,Slight fatigue during the day_ slept for 12-14 hours the first couple of days_ slight weight gain.,For me this medicine was a wonder drug. I had been on 100mg of Seroquel for sleep and depression_ which made me zombie-like and more depressed. I switched to Remeron and within 2 days my depression lifted. It was a life saver!   I have tried Remeron before_ and the first time I tried it_ I gained about 10lbs (which was fine because I'm underweight to begin with) and had a fair amount of daytime sleepiness. This time around_ I've had very minimal weight gain and very minimal daytime sleepiness. If your experiencing some exhaustion during the day_ HANG IN THERE. The sleepiness will go away! I'm taking this medicine primarily for sleep and depression but I have found that I've actually been able to stop taking my anxiety medication entirely! So it works REALLY well for anxiety. I take remeron in combination with Concerta 54mg_ and Wellbutrin 150mg. This combo has been great for me. Remeron can save you're life if you are experiencing significant depression.,F,27,2  weeks30 1X D,10/7/2010,Remeron

If I feel I won't be able to sleep because I'm excited or nervous about something I just take one so I don't start the horrific cycle of insomnia. The world is not the same place as it used to be_ so don't feel bad if you need a little help to fall asleep sometimes.,F,20,6  months15 MG 1X AN,10/7/2010,Remeron
192, 1, To sleep and gain weight,Severe acne on face_ neck_ chest and back. Came on after 3 days of taking the drug. I had totally clear skin up until then. Now taking more meds to clear the acne. Very violent mood swings when I wanted to hurt my dog and boyfriend. Got angry over simplest little things. Slept like a log_ but also felt useless and completely drunk the following day. I had no clear thought process at all. Cannot remember dressing myself and coming to work. Muscles on my arms and legs hurt so it was painful to do anything. I got bizarre electric zaps in my brain. My hair changed texture to thinner. Chest pain and shortness of breath  I cannot climb the shortest flight of stairs without being totally exhausted. My arms felt numb. My neck hurt. Rash underneath my left eye. Blurry vision. Pain in my eyes. Night sweats. Flu like symptoms that went away when I stopped taking the pill.,My doctor prescribed 15 mg Remeron for helping me to sleep because he did not want to give me sleeping pills. I think sleeping pills would have been better. I took Remeron for 4 days and that was it for me. They were to be a short term solution for 30 days with no refills. I cannot imagine what Id feel like if I had taken them the whole 30 days. The worst drug ever. I was totally useless those 4 days and still continue to be even though I stopped taking the drug 2 weeks ago. My acne is flourishing which is most upsetting to me. I noted that no other person mentioned getting acne. I guess I was the 'chosen' one. From now on_ Ill take nothing stronger than Tylenol. Remeron might work for others but holy cow_ it was a horrendous experience for me. Too bad that when I asked my doc about side effects_ all he told me was grogginess which would go away in 3 weeks (but if I was taking taking the pill for just 4 weeks_ 3 of them I'd have been a vegetable. No thanks)_ and weight gain (and I lost weight! I'm now at 98 lbs and for 5 foot 7_ this is not good)_ and when asked if there are any 'funky' side effects_ he told me he hadn't heard of any.

After I've been sitting down awhile and get up_ I litterly hobble to walk because my joints stiffen up and hurt so bad.  I'm now struggeling with a whole host of other problems I didn't have before the remeron.  I'm seeking an appointment with my doctor tomorrow to take me off the stuff.

After one month of adding this drug (I take welbutrin and depakote as well) I am starting to get out of the house more_ to go to support groups and try to make friends_ and to actually work on my problems. Therapy is an important part of treatment_ but before this medicine I couldn't make any progress. For the first time in 10 years I am happy and hopeful for the future!!! The side effects are well worth the benifits. The drowsiness is just enough to let me sleep great_ but I wake easily and am alert in the mornings.

I would have intense cravings at night and very early in the morning (for example_ getting up at 5 a.m. and eating 2 bagels and 3 bowls of cereal). I have an iron willpower when it comes to eating healthy and maintaining my weight - this medication was very unforgiving. I gained 20 pounds in 2 months!Within 45 mins. of taking remeron_ I would be fast asleep. I had very scary nightmares nearly every night_ however; they were vivid and seemed to last the entire time I was sleeping.I am usually a very active person_ and found it hard to muster up the energy to work out some days.

Its like taking Ecstasy_ crashing_ and everyday the crash gets worse_ and worse_ and worse_ and... you get the picture. The first few days were psychedelic and not in a fun way. for the first month I felt good. Now I am a zombie. I feel permanently brain damaged_ I am now flunking school after straight A's_ I can think and reason for about an hour a day.

You struggle to get up early morning and unfortunately this never subsides.The insatiable appetite for sugar also never subsides and unfortunately you will put weight on even with gym/exercise.I have just reduced to 30mg and had VERY bad withdrawel symptoms but this is to expected from over 2 years on 45mgs and after 10 horrific days all is settled again.,F,27,2  years45mg 1X D,7/22/2010Email,Remeron

I hate the weight gain as it is making me more depressed and angry but by far and away the biggest issue for me is the fact that I have seen NO positive effects (yet).  It has all been negative and the joint problems and fluid retention are really worrying me.  I thought that the side effects were supposed to be transient but how long is 'transient?'  I want to come off this drug but my husband is urging me to stick with it until I talk to the psychiatrist (yeah-like he is going to return my calls/emails.

Before I was on it_ I was underweight due to constant stomachaches everytime I tried to eat (This was caused by anxiety) and I could not sleep_ again due to anxiety. The OCD was interfering with my life on a daily basis; I couldnt eat at restraunts_ fast food_ or even friend's houses out of fear of getting food poisoning_ I was germaphobic_ and the obsessions/compulsions caused a huge ammount of anxiety. After taking Remeron_ almost all of that dissappeared. I gained weight (Though it leveled out quickly and I've weighed a steady 130 lbs for years now) the anxiety was gone_ and I could sleep. I still have some lingering loop-thoughts_ but the compulsions are pretty much gone and I'm not dictated by irrational fears anymore.

217, 5, Panic Disorder,Sleepiness_ small gain in appetite,Hi. I've been on Remeron for almost 3 and a half years and have had a very positive experience with uit. I started it during a fairly dark period of my life (early twenties_ new school and job on the east coast) and can honestly say it helped a ton. The meds make me tired but I had insomnia_ so that's fine. As far as weight gain...I've gained about 20 pounds...but that's over the course of three years_ and I was fairly underweight at the time...now I'm a healthy weight. If you control your cravings and exercise_ you'll be fine. Here are the problems with the drug: ZERO alcohol tolerance (you just pass out) and fairly impossible to quit it. I've tried tapering off but my anxiety comes roaring back with a vengeance. Also_ if you drink without skipping a dose_ you can expect a really terrible hangover with increased depression. I should know; it happened to me this morning. Overall_ though_ I wouldn't leave it for any other drug. It's been a miracle of sorts.,M,23,3  years30 MG 1X D,6/13/2010,Remeron

This side effect did pass.,After being tried on every antidepressant_ Remeron was the first antidepressant that made me feel not depressed. It is a miracle drug for me. I did have some weight gain. I read more about Remeron and some sources stated that the weight gain would decrease with increased dose. That is what I found_ I increased it to 1.5 45mg for a while and am now at 90mg.

I quit taking it daily and took it only when I was desperate for sleep.  Even at a higher dose_ it no longer helped me fall asleep or stay asleep.  Instead_ I developed uncontrollable restless legs_ to the point of moving to the couch to avoid kicking my spouse.  What a relief to realize it is actually the medication causing this problem_ meaning it will go away if I stop taking the Remeron (which wasn't helping me sleep anymore_ anyway.

236, 4, Depression_ Anxiety_ OCD,The two major side effects of this drug have been listed here ad nauseam: increased appetite and sleepiness. When you start this drug you will be an outright zombie for the first week or two_ or at least that was my experience. If you have a job that requires you to be coherent in any way_ best of luck to you. Thankfully for me I was between jobs. This intense zombie like period passes but I am still having difficulty getting up in the morning. Some people have said that moving from 15mg to 30mg helped lessen the desire to sleep in but I haven't found that to be the case. With respect to the eating: I considered myself lucky at first since I didn't notice either a change in weight or a change in appetite. Over time though I started to realize that my appetite had in fact grown quite a bit. Most of it is mindless eating and you don't realize at all that you're doing it_ which might explain why some people say they've gained weight without changing eating habits (not saying it's impossib,Despite the negative side-effects_ Remeron has been a surprisingly good drug. Interestingly it never seems to be a first line drug for OCD or anxiety and yet both have been very well managed by the med. I've tried everything including Wellbutrin (increased anxiety and OCD)_ Effexor (sweat like a maniac_ zero libido)_ Luvox & Zoloft (both worked for anxiety to some degree but had memory problems on both and sexual side effects were not tolerable) and Celexa (sweating_ sexual side effects). Needless to say there is always a trade off with these medications but if you're a man in your mid-30s_ the sexual side-effects can be particularly hard to live with. I have found Remeron to be relatively free of any of the usual SSRI sweating / libido / cognitive & memory inducing side effects. I'll check back up on this board in a few months to give it a final verdict. If I haven't ballooned into a fat slob_ I'll give this one an A.,M,37,2.5  months30MG 1X D,3/12/2010,Remeron
237, 1, Depression and anxiety,Immediate and rapid weight gain_ nausea and decrease in appetite_ clenched jaw from days 2-3 on the drug_ going numb and getting pins and needles very easily. Excessive sleeping and grogginess,I read hundreds of posts on this site about this drug on my first few days taking it. I kept expecting to be fighting urges to munch on sweets. Those urges never came. Instead I have been fighting waves of nausea and feelings of utter exhaustion. I know that I have not given this drug a long enough trial to rate its effect on my depression_ but I am in the midst of weaning off Zoloft_ and although my sex drive has returned_ I am fighting labile moods_ lethargy_ irritation and sadness as if I were back to square one_ pre-Zoloft (Zoloft was an amazing drug for my depression but destroyed my libido). At this point I am feeling as depressed as ever_ too tired to function unless I'm consuming at least 40 ounces of coffee a day_ and not interested in food. Because of my preparation for the weight side effects of this drug_ I figured I would be able to ward off any weight gain. I have gained 6 pounds in one week despite this and decided to do some research. I found that certain people seem to have a vulnerability to weight gain on this drug because of their physiological make-up. Tonight is my last dose of the drug. I'll have to be miserable until my next appointment with my doc. It's not worth it for me. Though I have heard it has worked wonders for others and not everyone is effected by the weight gain_ I certainly have been. I am hoping that I can find some drug that meets my needs and am feeling a bit discouraged at this point.,F,26,9  days30 mg 1X D,3/1/2010Email,Remeron

Didnt enjoy food but just wanted to eat and eat. Sedative affects started to wear off after 3-4 weeks and I then felt like I was climbing the walls with anxiety again and began having panic attacks.

I find I no longer walk around with my head down in public. My roommate notices too. Says I have become more involved in things. The only thing I don't like is the dry mouth in the morning.

This drug helped both of these problems_ and I was back sleeping like a baby again within a couple of days. This drug starts working almost immediately.The morning drowsiness was quite bad_ and it never really sorted itself out. I was hopeless of a morning_ looked like a complete zombie_ and driving the car to work was pretty sketchy.Whilst taking the drug_ I am convinced my metabolism slowed down_ as I followed a strict diet but still put on weight. When I stopped taking the drug after 2 years_ I lost 5kgs in a matter of weeks_ with no change to exercise routine or diet.There are no magic ADs out there.

Her doctor selected it specifically for its supposed sleep aid but it is having the opposite effect on her.  She can fall asleep but then wakes up after a short time and can't go back to sleep.  She has a decent appetite but has actually lost a bit of weight likely due to her anxiety over this lack of sleep.  Her BP has also risen; wasn't thinking about the relationship of that to the Remeron but after reading other comments_ maybe it is the cause as well.

I slept the perfect amount of time every night_ I could eat 3000 calories in a day_ as opposed to 250_ and my anxiety attacks were under control.But weed is illegal and expensive. So I went to the doctor. After getting put on a ton of other drugs that dont help_ I was also put on remeron_ to help me sleep at night_ and to boost my appetite. For shortness sake: The remeron makes me feel like a train hit my head while I was asleep_ I cant wake up for at least 10 hours_ my appetite hardly went up (I crave sugar a little bit more)_ I have vivid_ often disturbing dreams that I dont enjoy 100% of the time. The only thing it helps with is my vomiting in the morning.Instead of putting me on $2500 of drugs every month_ that all have addictive potential and withdrawl syndroms_ and dont help (when COMBINED) nearly as much as weed_ why cant they just prescribe me marinol? Because theyre dumb zombies. Im on xanax_ klonopin_ lexapro and remeron.

Permanent changes in metabolism.,I agree with everything posted by the person who wrote on 1/24/10.   I also have been a runner for many years - I was a marathon runner before I took Remeron.  While on Remeron_ my blood pressure shot up from 90/50  to 145/90  and I experienced excruciating muscle pain_ weakness_  and atrophy.  I suddenly had trouble running at all and could not walk up the stairs without being short of breath.  My blood pressure returned to normal when I went off Remeron_ but the other side effects persist over two years later. It took a year after I discontinued Remeron before  I regained some of my strength_ but I never regained the muscle mass.

253, 1, Severe depression + Sleep problems,Hangover every morning_ weight gain_ weight gain and yet more weight gain!,I began taking Remeron last July for depression and sleeping problems.  Starting dose was 15mg rising to 30 mg and then 45 mg.  I felt hungover most mornings and sluggish all day_ craving for bad foods which i controlled by nibbling on fruit.  Since last July i have gained 45lbs - yes_ 3 stone!  I have gone from a size 8 to a size 14.  I have been slim all my life and even when 9 months pregnant my weight never went over 9 stone.  I am very athletic_ competing in half marathons on a regular basis.  I run between 25 and 30 miles every week and as i've been running for many years_ i am well aware of calorie intake and what my body needs.  When the weight started piling on_ i reduced my calorie intake to 1300 per day which was far less then what i should be burning off each day and wrote down every calorie i ate even down to the 5 calories in my black coffee but the weight kept coming! I finally gave up last week after trying to lose 6 lbs in preperation for a skiing holiday by running an extra 8 miles and swimming every day before my run_ i gained another 5 lbs. My running times have got slower and slower over the last few months_ a recent check up at the doctors revealed that my blood pressure has risen too.  An average reading for me was 80/50 this is now 147/95.  I am now coming off Remeron and will see how i cope. I hope to get back to my pre Remeron weight of 8 stone 4.

254, 5, Depression/Insomina,Sleepiness_ Dizzy and irritable for the first week or so_,Just take these comments with a grain of salt. Everyone is different. I was on Remeron for 2 years several years ago. I started taking it again this month. Yes_ I gained weight the first time but I also lost it while I was still taking it. Just don't gorge. Also_ I didn't have any 'permanent fat cells' after I came off of it.... nor did it disrupt my sleeping habits afterwards. Sure_ it might do that to some_ but not everyone.Read these for piece of mind (just as I am doing) but don't replace your mind with it. If you don't like it_ talk to your doctor about changing. If you're getting hungry all day-- eat carrots_ not snickers. Weight gain solved.,F,27, ,1/23/2010,Remeron

I worry about things a lot less_ and dont get depressed too much while I am on it.  The bad part for me at least_ this drug has a tendency to blur my vision_ and I cant figure out why.  Another thing which may affect people is this drug makes you very hungry.  Not a big deal for me_ but for some with less self control you will add some pounds.  The trade off for me is worth it.  With proper diet and some exercise weight gain should not be an issue.  One awesome benefit of this drug is it makes you sleep really well.  I have not slept this good in years.

I cannot vouch for others_ but over a three month period I put on 30 pounds. That's right_ 10 pounds a month. I have NEVER had a problem with my weight. Twenty minutes after you have taken this medication the drowsiness will hit you_ and then the Sugar & Salt Zombie will take over your body. Cake bowls full of cereal and milk_ bags of crisps_ etc. You get the picture.

Mild GI side effects_ some gas and bloating_ but then again I also have IBS so that may have something to do with it.",Look_ just because a drug didn't work for you doesn't mean it's a worthless drug.  Remeron helped me with a minimum of side effects.  In the past I had briefly tried other medications for my SAD (winter depression) and have gotten unbelievable side effects.  Wellbutrin was 4 days of clinical mania.  Didn't sleep a wink.  Not one minute in 4 days.  Lexapro was a TOTAL loss of ALL sexual function [I'm female].  Paxil was a panic attack that landed me up in the hospital with a pulse just slightly over 200 and I've never had any issues with anxiety before.  I could not stay on any of these medications long enough to tell if they would help my SAD or not.  At a loss as to what else to try my new doctor gave me Remeron and for me_ it was the magic bullet.  I was experiencing such strong symptoms that I very literally felt nothing but apathetic and overwhelmed by the smallest task - I missed 2 weeks of work because the thought of making breakfast was just too much work and then I didn't have to worry about it because I stopped eating entirely.  I had no food in the house for over a week because going to the grocery was too much work.  I lost 15# that I could not afford to lose.  All my emotions were just gone.  The only thing I wanted to do on the rare occasions I was out was go back home and sit on the couch again.

265, 3, mainly depression and worry,sluggishness,I think the trick to this drug is starting at 30 mgs.  I did a few days of 15 mgs and was overcome by the effects of sedation.  The shrink upped the dosage and everything was better.  This drug has improved my mood but not quite enough for my satisfaction.  I don't feel as energized_ but I've read that at higher dosages the drug is more energizing.  So I am moving up in dosage to 45 mg. as of this evening.  I do agree with the 30-year-old guy lower down.  The weight gain is possible if you give into it.  Yes_ you get more cravings_ but either you manage them or you don't.  If you give into them_ then you diet the next day.  I asked my pharmacist about this.  He told me no patient on this drug has complained of weight gain.  There has been some talk of metabolism changes that make weight gain happen despite appetite control.  I'd like to know more about this because I work out and am in good shape and don't want to lose the edge.  So anyone who knows anything about this please post.  Vis a vis eating_ I do think the drug makes food taste better_ another reason people overeat.  I read in a post somewhere_ not on this site I don't think_ that taking remeron is the anti-depressant equivalent of smoking marijuana.  It heightens the experience of eating.  That said_ it can be controlled.,M,51,4  weeks,1/6/2010,Remeron

It has also had a significant positive impact on my anxiety_ which is the larger portion of my dual diagnosis (GAD/depression) situation. In summary_ I'm not dancing in the street and passing out flowers_ but I feel better.  I think I'll give it another month at 15mg. and if I hold steady_ ask the p-doc about upping me to 22.5 or potentially 30 mg.

269, 5, Major depression_ anxiety,Increased appetite at 15 mg_ that went away when upped to 30 mg. Morning drowsiness that wore off after a week or so of first taking it. Increased sensitivity to alcohol.,Honestly_ I wish I would have taken this medication sooner- I would have spent a lot less time being anxious and depressed. The weight I gained was the weight I lost during my depression (about 5-10 lbs.) When I was upped to 30 mg_ I didn't have the appetite or drowsiness like I did at 15 mg. I slept better at  15 mg_ but overall I feel better now w/ 30 mg. I'm glad I didn't see these other posts before taking it or I would have been scared off. This stuff really helped me. Word to the wise: watch your alcohol intake while taking this stuff. My tolerance went out the window_ now one drink is like having 2-3. Good luck!,F,23,7  months,1/3/2010,Remeron

All hell broke loose when I eased off of it.,After getting off the drug_ I could not sleep well - even with xanax and ambien.

274, 3, Major Depressive Disorder,Hmmm_ well intially this was the miracle drug.  I was able to sleep like a baby_ my depression was gone or at least managable_ but the pounds continued to pack on.,So this is my first post and I must say that I am quite upset with myself for not checking this site 4 months ago when I began the medication for what to expect.  As I stated in the otehr comments section_ at first things were sweet on the drug.  I was taking 30 mg at night and sleeping like a baby. Less irriated_ agitated_ and almost no anxiety issues.  During the 1st month I was so happy to be feeling better I attributed the weight gain with all the celebrating I was doing for having my life back (this accounted for about 10-12 lbs).  The second month I was still feeling good but started to get upset about the weight gain_ but still attributed to other things like_ being at home on stress leave for 2 months_ so I began an intensive work out regimen along with diet pills to curb my appetite and began eating healthier.  I've been working out for about 6 wks now and I can honestly say I've seen no change.  Sometimes I even feel like I'm gaining weight.  My stomach and lower back and thighs seems to have really been where the pounds have made their home and already being a thick girl this is not OK!  I also have been experiencing night terrors lately.  So bad that I feel like I am actually fighting the entire time Im sleep and wake up feeling exhausted.  The dreams are really detailed too_ and most of them are reccuring sitautions that are devastating to go through even in a dream.  So after 4 months and about 2 pant sizes_ I've decided to remove this drug from my body.  I have,F,28,4  months,12/8/2009Email,Remeron

After being on it a little while_ I got these derealization effects where I would walk around in a fog completley detached from everything and everyone around me. This in-effect caused my mental anxiety to worsen since I found it so hard to fuction on this med due to feeling drugged. It also made me feel dead inside where I became completley flat/ numb and I hated that feeling. The only good things that came from this med was that it allowed me sleep and it restored my appetite at a time when I really needed both. Overall however_ the bad outweighed the good so I got off.,M,29,5  weeks,12/4/2009,Remeron

Sleep is great - better than ever.,I have taken remeron for about 5 years. It saved my bacon. Had terrible insomnia and it was the only thing that worked. I did have a brief relapse after about a year_ so in desperation_ I learned progressive muscle relaxation. Learning to discipline myself to do 20 mins of meditative_progressive relaxation_ plus remeron (I've gone from 15mg to 7.5mg) has helped me enormously. I would say to anyone suffering through insomnia_ that the combination of the drug and a little training in relaxation could bring much relief.As for the munchies_once I was sleeping well again_ I got my energy back_ and I started gently cycling to work everyday (major adjustment!)and walking at lunch. That has kept the weight down. For me_ remeron has been a blessing.Take care and good luck.,M,46,5  years,12/2/2009,Remeron

Vivid (with a capital V) and prolific dreams_ but no real nightmares,I'm taking 15mg. daily for depression/anxiety and to ease my taper from low levels of zolpidem and diazepam_ (5mg every other day and 3 mg day respectively). I've only been taking it 2 weeks as of today and can't say it has helped of yet_ although I do feel more placid in general. I think I may be in the transitional phase where the drug is starting to kick in as I have alternating periods of energy/clarity (new to me of late..) and pretty profound blues.

HOWEVER_ I HIGHLY DOUBT THE MEDICATION ITSELF IS CAUSING THE WEIGHT GAIN. IT WILL INCREASE YOUR APPETITE BUT JUST DONT GORGE AND YOU WILL GAIN NOTHING.

282, 3, Difficulty sleeping,Serious. Weight. Gain. Ugh!,I'm so disappointed! Remeron has been the only drug that has truly worked for me with my sleep issues (early waking and subsequent insomnia)_ but the weight gain was awful. I gained 25 lbs in 4 months! I've never gained weight with any other medicine so honestly_ it didn't occur to me that Remeron might be the culprit. I started back on my diet pills which curbed my appetite and gave me lots of energy. I was working out and eating little...but I was still gaining weight! Finally a nurse friend of mine suggested it was a reaction to medication. I checked my other meds_ but none showed weight gain as a side effect. Then I checked for Remeron and boom! Blogs and websites everywhere testified to the weight gain. So I've gone off the med_ but I'm still not losing weight despite the fact that I am eating very little. So now I'm fat and sleepless. This is so frustrating to me. Have I wrecked my metabolism permanently? Does anyone have a tip for getting your body back after Remeron?,F,41,5  months,11/21/2009,Remeron

When I looked back at when I began taking Remeron and the weight gain beginning_ it was a 'perfect match'. My appetite and eating habits hadn't changed_ but my weight had. That's when I decided to look up 'Ask a Patient' to see what others have experienced. (A friend had told me about the site_ and I think it's wonderful!!!Thank you)When I initially read about the possible side effects of the drug_which was given to me when I first started taking it_ it included absolutely everything imaginable_so it wasn't any help.

288, 5, Severe Depression and Anxiety,Late evening munchies_ excitation when I tried to increase to 45mg,I posted in June and wanted to update. I guess I've been on 30mg for the past four months. A few weeks ago I tried to increase my dosage to 45mg. I was taking 30mg at night and 15mg in the morning. For the first few days I felt great (I'm wondering if it may have been placebo) but after three days I was unable to get to sleep when I took my dose before bed. So now I'm back to 30mg and things are still ok. The one thing I've noticed that separates this drug from the dozen or so others I've tried is that you don't feel apathetic. I still have bad days and I still have bouts of anxiety sometimes. I have less suicidal ideations and am able to get my work done more effectively. I know that many people pass on this drug because of all the accounts of weight gain. Unlike some of the other psych meds_ remeron doesn't make you gain weight. It just makes you hungry. Just by knowing this I was able to keep my weight gain to under 10 pounds. I recently started taking 5-htp in the am which works like an appetite suppressant. WARNING: You shouldn't take 5-htp if you are on any other SSRI or med that effects serotonin. Anyway I'll continue to update every few months.,M,32,4  months,10/12/2009,Remeron

I tried a lot of other medicine which made me feel worst. Remeron seemed to work for me. I didn't feel anxious and depressed and I could live a normal life. My doctor told me that I needed to stay on medicine for a least 1 year_ but because I felt good I thought I could handle a normal life on my own without any medicine's help. I was wrong. There were some events in my life that dragged me down. I was depressed every day and very_ very anxious all the time. I started taking 15 mg of Remeron 7 days ago and today I will increase to 30mg. I've been feeling depressed_ anxious_ tired_ and I feel like sleeping and eating all the time. I know that I will gain weight (it happened before) but I need it_ because I lost a lot for the past month. There are a lot of side effects but I hope that soon I will feel better. I know for sure that it takes a while to feel the improvement. Sometimes it's very hard to give the medicine time to work and you think that instead of helping you it makes you feel worst. Everybody is different and reacts differently to this kind of drugs. I've learned that it's very important to give the medicine time to work.

299, 5, Depression_ GAD,Remeron made me sleep for 48 hours straight through when I started out at 15 mg.  Thankfully my doctor anticipated this and gave me a note for work.  For the next two weeks I continued to take 15mg. at bedtime and it knocked me out right away.  This was great as I was having trouble sleeping.  I had difficulties getting up in the morning_ and for the first month at 15mg. I would get really sleepy at work around 3PM.  This side effect eventually went away.  I increased to 30mg as I was tolerating the drug well.  At 30mg_ the drug still put me to sleep.  After a month at 30mg_ I really started to notice an increase in my overall happiness!  The things that used to make me cry no longer did!!  I'm feeling very upbeat and thinking of asking to increase the dosage to 45mg.,This drug worked great for me!!!  I didn't have any of the weight gain issues that plague most people on this medication.  It's been 2.5 months and no weight gain.  I've been on all of the SSRI's and all they ever did is decrease my sex drive.  Remeron is amazing!  I'm happy_ I still have my sex drive_ and I'm not gaining weight!

I didn't take one last night_ the doc put me on 15mg at bedtime_ I hope it isn't the Remeron because it has helped me by increasing my appetite. I weigh about 98 lbs_ I'm 31 and have 2 kids. My problem is that I can't gain weight or keep it. My metabolism is very high. The Remeron has worked for me other than the headaches. I am going to call my doctor about it today and see what he says. I hope he can help with the headaches_ cuz I really don't want to stop taking the Remeron. I really_ really want to gain some weight!!! So_ my advice to you is to try it_ everyone has different reactions to things_ you'll never know if you don't try it!,It has helped me sleep_ I do have more vivid dreams but I can't really remember them.

I looked like I was 4 months PG. Tinutitis_ and dry mouth which I seem to get with any of the anxiety_ or anitdepressant meds.  Short term memory loss. Awesome dreams makes me want to sleep more which is no problem with taking this med.  Want to eat more.  Limbs weak my legs feel very heavy and have difficulty at times moving them.  The pros to me on this med is eating because I'm underweight you do want to eat more carbs_ sweats but all you have to do is keep healthy snacks at home. Also remeron has halped with my insomnia as I was only sleeping 3 to 5 hrs a night. I found I could sleep to much so I would make myself get up when I awoke the first time and not let myself go back to sleep.  Cons they outweigh the pros.  I have to determine whether its worth taking.  I plan to stay on Remeron for 1 to 2 months then getting off if side effects do not improve.  It is tempting to stay on Remeron to gain weight and get sleep.  It has been startling to read all the negative side effects with Remeron.  Its seems there are more than any drug I have taken before. I'm not into taking drugs so I will not take anything for side effects as you can end up taking to many drugs with no real benefits.

304, 4, Panic Disorder,30mg: sleepiness for 1st week_ small appetite increase.  45mg: slightly higher anxiety baseline_ occasional RLS.,Tried several SSRIs_ but could not tolerate them at all.  Even small doses heightened my anxiety level causing daily panic attacks. Remeron greatly diminished anxiety levels. At 30 mg I would have maybe 2 minor panic attacks a week. Greatly helped with GI tract symptoms. Previous panic attacks were accompanied severe stomach cramps and nausea_ including immediate bowel movements and vomiting. Have been on 45mg for 2 weeks now_ not sure it has helped my anxiety. Feel like it has raised my anxiety baseline.  No panic_ but overall higher level of daily anxiety with the higher dose.  Has anyone else experienced this? Occasional RLS at night_ but no more than an annoyance. Overall_ remeron has greatly helped my panic disorder. When I do experience increased anxiety it does not progress to full-blown panic.  Have not experienced full-blown panic attack w/GI symptoms since I have been on it.  Also on 1mg of lorazepam used as needed for immediate panic relief. Only use 2-3 a month since Remeron.,F,22,5  weeks,8/5/2009,Remeron

308, 5, Severe Depression,Significant weight gain,I am reposting after over 3 months of taking it (I posted back in April) The side effects are gone_ but the weight gain lingers. I started eating healthier and less_ and that stopped the weight gain_ but now I just can't lose it. Overall_ I gained 20 lbs in less than a month.HOWEVER_ it is the best antidepressant I've ever had (I've had prozac_ celexa_ wellbutrin_ zoloft and a few others)- I sleep great_ I feel great_ and now that my dosage is up all other side effects are gone - I no longer get jumpy or want to eat everything. It's made me a less picky eater and I crave healthy food now_ plus my sex drive is actually higher_ and I can drink alcohol again (after 6 years of wellbutrin_ it's great!),F,26,3  months,7/28/2009,Remeron
309, 4, Obsessive Compulsive Dissorder,Sometime ache like I have the Flu_ moderate weight gain_ fatigue and sometimes stomache problems.,Best medication I have been on_ my head is not in a fog like other medications.  I would highly recommend this. Also helps me sleep at night. Stay away from Effexor the withdrawls are brutal_ just my opinion. Lexapro and Celexa where okay but not to effective.,M,44,180  days,7/21/2009,Remeron
310, 5, Severe anxiety_ panic & depression,You will feel zonked out for a number of days. My son was very tired and zoned out for 3 days intially. He complained of a burning smell in his nose. He eats quite a bit now (for some this may be a worry) but I think it's worth feeling well.,My son was in a dark_ dark place. This drug has helped him stop feeling like he was constantly sick and helped his irritable bowel. It also stopped him thinking he was having an anneurism and calmed his panic disorder right down. He has gained weight and looks better_ he is sleeping much_ much better. I'm hoping he can leave the house next when the full effects kick in - it's looking promising. He has tried several SSRI's and Valium to no avail. I believe my son is beginning to enjoy aspects of his life now and will be able to go back to school & dance and for that I'm grateful. We can breathe again. I was nervous originally about this medication. If your child is prescribed this don't be put off it has been helpful for my teenager. Good luck to you all.,M,16,2  weeks,7/20/2009,Remeron
311, 3, severe depression and ocd,10 pound weight gain; always craving food; rage; restless leg syndrome,I gained ten pounds after a month and even though I ran everyday and competed in 10ks I could not lose it.

312, 1, Sleep issues_ misdiagnosed bipolar,depression_ extreme exhaustion_ dizziness_ weakness_ EXTREME uncontrollable rage_ sometimes to the point of physical violence_ suicidal/homicidal thoughts_ anxiety_ ...,These pills are absolutely AWFUL. When I was on Remeron_ I felt like an absolute zombie_ and I had awful fits of uncontrollable rage and depression. I once tried to kill myself on these horrible drugs. It eventually got so bad that I ended up being put in a mental hospital for a week. I stopped taking all pills a week after that_ because I realized that if pills are capable of doing this to me_ I probably don't belong taking them. Ever since I quit these pills_ I never forgave my psychiatrists.,M,21,4  months,7/16/2009,Remeron
313, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ Insomnia,Weight gain_ short-term memory loss_ decreased attention_ hypertension_ daytime drowsiness (all diminished after starting low-carb diet)_  increased restless legs (though diagnosed prior to starting Remeron_ take Requip now_ which alleviated)_ dizziness_ decreased libido_ recently became agitated,"30 mg. Tried about 10-15 different meds (mostly SSRI's_ Seroquel_ Lithium) before Remeron. Many made symptoms worse & some made me manic_ which I never was before. This is the ONLY med that worked for anxiety_ depression & insomnia. Benefits clearly outweigh side-effects_ most of which have subsided or are at least bearable. Tried increasing to 45 recently due to return of some anxiety_ but became agitated. Needed to gain about 10 lbs. but gained 30+. CONSTANTLY craved sugar/carbs. Once I ate carbs_ I kept craving more & more. Low-carb lifestyle (Atkins) & exercise worked wonders! Lost ALL unwanted weight. Completely controls carb-cravings & all the ""good"" fat I eat (fish_ flax-seed_ olive oil_ etc.) helps with mood & focus. I don't eat greasy or high saturated fat foods_ I eat healthy carbs & fats. My BP & cholesterol are perfect now. I have more energy & think clearly. On the rare occasion I crave sugar_ I chew sugar-free gum or eat fruit. I now weigh 125 lbs. @ 5'6 & feel great. Not a single panic attack in 10 yrs.! Occasionally get mildly anxious or  depressed but can get out of it quickly. No self-injurious behaviors or suicidal thoughts in 10 yrs. either. Requip helps with restless legs.",F,41,10  years,7/13/2009,Remeron
314, 4, Anxiety/Depression,Well I started taking this drug a cpl years ago at the 7.5 dose and all I wanted to do was sleep and eat. I gained 10 pds in 2 weeks so I quit it and within another 2 weeks I had lost that weight. I have decided to give it another try as I have been told that the higher doses do not give you as sedative effect the lower dose does. So far this is proving true. After 5 days on 15 I upped to 30 ....I haven't noticed the appetite as much as i did on the lower dose....the dreams I am having thought are very vivid and realistic and almost kinda scary...I hope these go away ...w,,M,31,6  days,7/11/2009Email,Remeron

316, 1, Bipolar (depression),Fatigue.,Useless. I took it a few years ago during a suicidal depression. The most it did was to put a sort of blanket over my feelings of sadness without lifting my mood. I felt flat_ which was almost worse. It also took ages to work. I finally told my doctor I could not stand it any more so he changed me to something else.,F,41,4  weeks,7/3/2009,Remeron
317, 4, Anxiety_ depression_ insomnia,Some antihistamine side affects for the first few days after taking it such as increased hunger_ and a bit spaced out. Kind of felt like I had taken some gravol the night before. Some vivid dreams.,At first the sedative action worked very well. I have noticed since going up to 30mg that I have a more difficult time getting asleep_ but once I'm there I sleep through the night. I also take a small dose of seroquel (25mg)_ and trazadone (50mg). This drug was a life saver for me. I had tried every SSRI with no effect_ I went to to the atypical anti psychotics which only made me a blubbering idiot and my depression worse. I don't feel great_ but I'm at least coping. Considering that there are events going on in my life which could cause anyone distress_ I'm impressed.The whole weight gain thing is simply increased appetite. It only took me realizing that I wasn't really hungry to break this side effect. Also_ I had lost 15lbs as a result of this depression. By far the best AD I have ever been on.,M,33,12  days,6/24/2009,Remeron
318, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ Insomnia,Fatigue throughout the day that subsided over the first few weeks.Vivid dreams initially. They were actually kind of fun.  No problems with increased appetite or weight gain.,Really helped with Insomnia.  I haven't slept this good in 10 years.  Regarding weight gain as many have posted.  Clinical trials indicate 10% of patients will gain weight.  That means 9 out of 10 people won't!  I'm hoping to be one of them.  Eating healthy and exercising.,F,40,1  months,6/6/2009,Remeron

Stilnox made me moody and aggressive_ while benzodiazepines_ esp Alzam gave me very light sleep_ early waking.

320, 3, nausea_ anxiety and insomnia,at first you are very tired but after a week it goes away. It does increase your appetite and you will gain weight. It is a great sleeping pill and to cure nausea. but unfortunately once you reach  your goal weight_ it keeps on adding up.,I do feel good on this drug_ but don't like the extra weight coming with it.  Going to try to get off of it_but afraid severe  nausea and sleeplessness will return again.

This was a few years ago.  I don't take it anymore_ because of the dreams.  Although I was recently accidently presciribed this instead of Rozerem.  The next day the doctor called in the Rozerem.  So now I have thirty 30mg pills that I think I will keep if I ever want to experience those crazy dreams again.  I still remember the dreams from years ago like they happened last night.

Did wonders for the anxiety and insomnia and has certainly helped me be a better mom for the last 20 months. I have been tapering off it for the last 6 months and am now on week 3 without remeron.

Because of the NE action_ after a while_ you may start getting a bad temper on it...agitation  Add a little Valium to it then_ and you'll have a great combo.

I have unexplained nausea that may or may not be psychiatric in nature (I'm going back to the GI in a few weeks to get it sorted out) and without Remeron I would not eat.  It's a fabulous antiemetic and I don't know why it isn't marketed as such more often (It's a 5HT-3 antagonist).  For anyone with decreased appetite or GI issues_ it's truly amazing.  Plus_ it lacks the sexual side effects common with SSRIs.,F,21,8  months,5/2/2009,Remeron

331, 5, insomnia,The number one side effect for me was drowsiness! I think I slept 20 hours the first night I took it. I also experienced weird dreams and had a hard time thinking clearly. I remember being confused and disoriented when I was awake. This only lasted the first week...but_ I was finally able to sleep so I didn't care.,I was put on 15 mg. of remeron  a year ago to help with insomnia. I have been taking paxil for over 8 years for depression but when menopause hit_ I could not function because insomnia was taking over my life. I tryed every sleep aid made available to me and nothing worked. My doctor recomended remeron and said that   if this drug doesn't help me sleep...nothing will.

Then I woke up thinking ""Donuts!!"" The next few days I ate about everything I saw and must have gained at least 5 pounds that week. At first it worsened my depression_ but after the first week everything's improved_ I can concentrate more_ depression is gone_ etc. My appetite has gone down_ but it seems like I don't know when I'm full anymore until I get sick. I just need to control my portions.",F,26,15  days,4/28/2009,Remeron
333, 4, Anxiety,Initial weight gain by about 7 pounds in 3 weeks.  Feeling a little more drowsy in the morning and occaisional sweet cravings.,When I first started this medication_ I was really concerned about the weight gain.  I didn't have some of the unstoppable appetite but I noticed that I was eating slightly larger portions.  In a short period of time I gained about 7 pounds.  I talked to someone else who has taken this medication for years and he said that weight watchers helped him to loose the weight_ so I did that and followed it closely and I lost 16 pounds so I am 9 pounds lighter then before.  I feel like all the other antidepressants like Paxil and Lexapro are great for anxiety but make me more tired during the day and have sexual side effects that make staying on them long term too much.  I feel good on Remeron at 22.5 and the hunger is managable and is not as bad as I thought it would be.  Overall_ I feel much less intense and less triggered...less vigilent...all of my issues are not gone but they feel more managable.,M,33,6  months,4/21/2009,Remeron

335, 5, Depression,"Increased hunger but NO weight gain_ a little sleepy an hour after taking it but not excessive_ more ""active"" dreams but not overwhelming_ NO sexual side effects.",I understand the biggest complaint / side effect about this drug is rapid weight gain - I haven't experienced this at all. I've only been taking Remeron for a couple of weeks so it's a bit early to understand its overall effect on me - but so far_ so good. Side effects are barely noticable and I am noticing a difference in mood. Perhaps it's a placebo effect but it's a positive one - so I will continue and hope to continue this positive course. Don't give up. Meds may or may not be the answer for you. Personally_ I believe they are an effective tool - and for people with severe_ unmanageable depression - a very important tool. I have worked with Lexapro_ Wellbutrin_ Trazodone_ Xanax (for anxiety) and several others. Remeron appears to be a very useful tool for me - thus the high rating.,M,30,2  weeks,4/19/2009,Remeron

Constantly in a drug induced haze_ eating non stop and feeling incredibly uncomfortable sums up that week from hell. Slept for 15 hours out of the 24 and when I was awake_ may as well have been asleep as I was non-functional.Think long and hard before taking this medication.,M,38,7  days,4/17/2009,Remeron

338, 5, anxiety disorder_ insomnia,I initially started with 15 mg at bedtime. From the first night it allowed me to get a full nights sleep.  But initially I experienced the standard side effects; did not want to get out of bed in the morning_ was drowsy_ constant hunger.,"I incresed the dosage to 22.5 mg at bedtime_ then switched to 15 at bedtime_ and 7.5 in the morning.  My appetite has returned to normal (I didn't actually gain any wieght)  I sleep well at nignt_ get up feeling rested_ and do not suffer drowsiness during the day_ even with the 7.5 mg I take in the morning.When my ansiety started (prett severe) I started with xanax_ but didn't get much relief.  I switched to diazepam_ and worked much better_ but contrary to what many docs tell you_ I definitely developed tolerance to the anxialytic and sedative effects_ and didn't want to keep excalating the dosage.  I tried Buspar_ and 1) it took a full 6 weeks to have any effect_ and 2) even at 60 mg/day_ gave me only a few hours of relief after each dose.  It was not very helpful with the sleep problem.  I tried geodon.  It gave me sleep_ but I was ""drunk: for 2-3 hours after I wake up.  So the next step was Remeron.  Once I got acclimated to it_ there have been no side effects_ it is a wonderful sleep aid_ and keeps my anxiety under control.  I had a complete physical afer I had been on Remeron for 4 months_ and all my numbers (blood work_ cholesterol_ triglycerides_ blood sugar_ etc) are normal.I am slo-o-wly withdrawing from teh diazepam.  I have occasional nervous spells (but not the severe anxiety I originally suffered) and I think the nervousness is rebound from the diazepam withdrawal.Remeron has been a wonderful treatment for me.",M,67,7  months,4/5/2009,Remeron

It controls my IBS and CFS perfectly_ but it dulls my mood. Once you start_ it's not like Paxil_ where you can just get off...you will need some help. I have considerable experience with this medicine and have tried to come off 5 times and it has never worked_ but that might be for a reason. It controls sleep like non-other_ but away the Ambien_ and it controls IBS and major pain like symptoms with FMS/CFS.,M,24,2  years,3/14/2009Email,Remeron

I still have no sex drive_ but I don't know if it's Remeron or lingering depression.,I also take 15 mgs of Ambien every night to sleep.

After a year on Remeron_ I added Lexapro and was able to titrate up to a decent dose without having anxiety. I then stopped taking the Remeron.

348, 1, Major Depression,WEIGHT GAIN. I will say I have had some lifting of my depression_ however the side-effects are something I CANNOT live with - namely weight gain.  I have never gained as much weight as quickly as I have taking this medication. My doctor suggests that by increasing the dosage_ my weight will stabilize or decrease. This has not been the case. I will be discontinuing the medication as soon as possible. I am now looking at at least 5 months of weight reduction versus the 4 months it took to gain. If NO other medications work for you and you try this and it lifts your depression_ I recommend working closely with your doctor to find some other med to counter act it.,,M,44,5  months,2/22/2009,Remeron

Started 20 mg Lexapro (2.5 years) and Klonapin and slept about 6 hours per night but it wasn't the quality sleep. Since then I tried benzi's and sedative hypnotics for years but my body never felt fully rested after sleeping. My doctor put me on 15 mg of Remeron. After about 2 weeks I started sleeping 8-9 hrs per night and feel  el fantastic. I sleep         like better than I have since before this began. Excellent dreams.

Then after two months_ intense sweet cravings followed by a weight gain of 15 lbs. (6 of which i needed but the rest i could do without) A little more sluggish than usual.,For the first two months it worked really well with depression and anxiety at 30 mgs but the past few months I 've been feeling somewhat depressed again so the doc raised me to 45 mgs about 5 days ago and the only side effect so far is very intense dreaming.

It worked for insomnia and anxiety_ but made depression worse. My short term memory was shot while on it (no_ it was not due to depression_ it was the drug)_ and the scarry thing is that having been off it for about 6 months my short term memory is still shot. I have a degree in applied math and I no longer can think the way I used to_ can't solve problems the way I used to_ and I can't remember things anymore.

353, 1, Anxiety_ Depression,1st day slept most of the first 24 hours and ate the rest of the time. Slept for a few hours solid and woke up every hour or so - not restful sleep. Massive appetite - I can't stop eating even though I don't feel hungry. Gained 5 pounds in 4 days.,"If you are the least bit concerned about gaining weight_ do NOT take this. Unless you are extremely strong-willed you will not be able to control your eating. Don't even ""try"" it to see how it works - it is not worth it.

354, 5, panic/anxiety/depression,I had start up symptoms of sleepines and wanting to eat all the food in my house. When my pdoc raised my dosage to 45mg the sleep issues resolved and the constant craving for carbs has been easier to manage.,I've been on an off this drug a couple of times. Now_ I am taking it in combination with 15mg of Abilify. I have felt quick and dramatic improvements in my mood_ anxiety level_ and self-confidence. I also have not had a panic attack since starting the medication (knock on wood). I know that everyone is different but I have found this to be a great drug. I feel better than I have in at least a year. I still have some free-floating anxiety but it is much easier to handle. Also_ I came across a study that evaulated the combination of Abilify and Remeron and found them to be very effective in combination.,M,40,2  months,1/15/2009,Remeron
355, 1, depression,This drug picked me up and threw me over a cliff,I was prescribed Remeron because other drugs were less than effective in treating my depression. I took the drug twice and woke up feeling groggy and_ more importantly_ suicidal.

However_ they are no match for the horror I have encountered taking Remeron for 2 weeks. I've never felt this 'dead' or depressed or hopeless. The sexual side effects are a joke compared to this. These kind of pills affect everybody differently - however_ I would advise you to be careful before trying out Remeron. I stopped cold turkey about 36 hours ago and I do not feel any worse. Hopefully these symptoms will disappear once I get out of my system. Back to SSRIs for me.,M,19,2  weeks,12/30/2008,Remeron

So he put me on Lexapro_ which didn't agree with me at all 1 pill and done_ So the Dr put me on remeron 15mg and this stuff really knocks me out_ it seem to help a little_ I don't cry as much but I'm still sad.

I have been on all of the SSRIs and I have great difficulty due to the sexual side effects.  I am not happy about the 5 pounds but it has not gone up at all past the five pounds after a month of being on it.  I still have some slight anxiety but I feel much more calm and relaxed.  I get a little restless around the same time each night like about 24 hours after taking the last dose_ but nothing too uncomfortable.  I am not happy about the weight gain_ but 5 pounds isn't a big deal.  If I continue to feel as calm and relaxed as I do now I will be on it for the long haul.

Physical anxiety symptoms include: feeling on edge_ nervousness_ jittery stomach--felt like I have a ulcer; tightness in arms-biceps; and ear ringing. (Not many people seem to complain of ear ringing.)  Vivid dreams as well. Since increasing dose to 30 mg_ not much has changed. Will continue the 30 mg for a while--if nothing changes_ I will cut back to 15 mg. I have not experienced weight gain; seem to be a bit constipated.

365, 1, Depression,I used Remeron back in 1997 when it first came out.  After a while_ whenever I took a pill I got a sensation in my arms_ legs and head like all of the blood was leaving them_ then rushing back in_ and then leaving again_ in a cycle that lasted a couple of minutes and didn't stop.  Also_ my vision would get blurry when the blood rushed out_ then sharp again_ and there were sexual problems too.  It got much worse with caffeine or over the counter decongestants_ and back then_ marijuana_ which made it much worse.  I told my doctor_ and he actually increased my dose.  It got so bad_ I was having chest pains (not accompanied by anxiety) and getting dizzy.  Finally_ I stopped.  The symptoms NEVER WENT AWAY!  I have been suffering from this problem ever since.  I can't drink coffee or alcohol_ or use any drug that affects blood pressure or heart rate.  The cycle of blood rushing to and from my extremities occurs every minute of every hour of every day.

After two months my energy levels crashed and I could not shake a cold. I had worked up to 30mg/day. Bloodwork confirmed the necessity of immediate Remeron cessation. Lots of fun that week.

If you don't take it before midnight you will easily sleep past noon (that is if it isn't crucial that you be awake the next morning).  Weight gain was not an issue.,This drug finally did what it was supposed to do.  Made me not depressed_ and have a normal affect.  I must say it is quite a change_ and it is worth the side effects.  It also prevents you from craving to get fucked up.  That is miraculous.  I can't drink at all_ and I sure as hell don't want to.

However_ I really don't like the extreme hunger and have relapsed into binging after 10 years without such symptoms. I don't find it any easier to fall asleep than before_ but I sleep really long and don't care to get out of bed. I seem to care less about life's issues and have trouble thinking (which could be connected to the fact that I was given gabapenthine as well).

Just recently i figured out a solution: I take my full (30 mg) dose of remeron and 30mg of cymbalta at night before bed (hour or so before). Even though the cymbalta is a stimulant_ its properties combinen with rem to give nice sleep with less intense/crazy dreams. Dream recall is also lessened with this combo. I also have lung trouble.

Noticeable increase in appetite after a few days.  Pdoc increased dosage to 15 mg_ and that relieved some of the over-sedation.  2 weeks later we increased to to 22.5 mg.  I sleep very well (night time anxiety and and insomnia were 2 of my major initial symptoms).  I have now been on Remeron for about 2 months_ and at 22.5 mg for about a month.  Noticeable_ but manageable increase in appetite. I have not gained any weight.  No other side effects.,I began haven severe anxiety attacks about a year ago_ following a very painful_ prolonged_ and complicated kidney stone attack. I would wake up around 3 AM in a state of extreme anxiety_ and not be able to go back to sleep. I also had some severe periods from time to time during the day. I got so bad at times that I took all the guns out of my house and stored them at my son's house.Working with both my family doc and a psych doc_ I tried Xanax_ diazepam_ zoloft_ Buspar  and Geodon.  Contrary to generally accepted belief_ I develop tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of benzos_ and had to keep increasing dosage to maintain relief.  Buspar is helpful_ but not strong enough to give any lasting relief It would last about 3 hours after each dose. I was up to the max recomended dose of 60 mg/day.  Geodon was so sedating_ I couldn't function until late morning_ and even then was a little out of it.And I didn't want to keep increasing my benzo usage.So my psych put me on Remeron.,M,66,2  months,10/27/2008,Remeron

My appetite had already been already healthy_ and I have a fast metabolism_ but the pills made me gain over 15 lbs in a week.,I contacted the doctors that prescribed the pills to me. They automatically took me off of it_ and in 5 days_ I had lost 7 lbs.

As time wore on I noticed an extreme startle reaction to sound (such as phone ringing or my name being called) and that sounds seemed disturbingly much louder. Then_ I found that my anxiety became WORSE and I started to feel ""drugged"" more of the time. I also experienced visual afterimages which despite stopping the drug months ago I still have. This disturbs me and I wonder if they'll ever go away.",I was on 30 mg and wonder if it might have been OK if they'd prescribed a lower dose. Remeron did in fact improve my depression.

Docs gave me the usual SSRIs but I couldn't take them without unmanageable side effects. Lexapro almost sent me to the ER. I was put on Remeron (with 2mg Ativan) one and a half months ago. I have had only the slightest of beneficial effects_ so slight that it's almost not even worth the effort of opening the bottle for my next dose. But the pamphlet said 4-6 weeks before I might notice anything beneficial_ so I'll give it another three weeks_ which is when I see my psychiatrist again. If there is still no enhanced effect_ I'll let the doc know and request to go on a benzodiazapine (Xanax_ Valium_ Ativen_ etc.) till further notice. In the 18 years I've had these anxiety problems_ the benzos have been the only thing that has worked. As of right now I am ambivalent about Remeron.

Once I got past the initial dizziness and sleepiness_ the only complaint I had was the constant hunger. The weight gain was kind of depressing itself at first. I am down to 7.5mg (from 45mg a couple of years ago) and that seems to be about as low as I can go without awful withdrawal symptoms like brain zaps_ constant crying for no reason at all and insomnia. I am switching straight to Celexa tonight (originally came here to research that one) and I hope it's as easy as my doc seems to think it will be.  Remeron was a blessing for me_ but I'm hoping the Celexa will be easier to stop.  I don't advise taking Remeron if weight is an issue.  I was pretty thin when I started it_ so it didn't hurt me and I honestly didn't even care all that much after a while because I feel better about myself now that I'm not depressed_ but I wouldn't want to gain any more and the constant need to eat is embarassing and incon,F,45,8  years,10/3/2008,Remeron

This drug should especially be tried by people looking to gain weight or have trouble eating. It helped make me really happy again and I hadn't been that way in a long time and it made me 'destroy' my depression and anxiety and want to do things again.This is a great anti-depressant I can't see why this isn't entrily adopted to replace SSRI's.Great for people having trouble getting to sleep as well.I hope that this keeps up.,M,24,4  weeks,9/18/2008,Remeron

SSRI's like Lexapro just made me worse.  Prozac was terrible. The first week taking Remeron (15 mg) I was really groggy but then my anxiety lifted and I felt so much better. After 6 months my doctor added Provigil to counteract the tiredness and weight gain from the Remeron. This combination was fantastic and now I feel very normal.

Now I am considered morbidely obese wihich means my BMI is very high.,Having been treated for an emergency and on morphine for pain_ I decided to stop my Remeron. Where I live_ we have a health care crisis and it takes up to six months to see a doctor_ and that's for those who have a family doctor_ mental health problems are NOT a pritoty.

389, 5, Panic/Anxiety,Initial dizziness and stupor (disconcerting but went away after the first week). Weight gain (approx 10kg/22lbs). Some occasional  gastric troubles (loose bowel movements and upset stomach),Psych prescribed this as an addition to Paroxetine(SSRI) which had seemed to stop working all together. This medication was a god sent to me during a very trying time as I was in no place mentally to start coming off the Paroxetine. Felt better almost immediately. Helped immensely with the anxiety. Still had panic attacks but the intensity and recovery were greatly reduced. In a better place now and have come completely off the Paroxetine for the first time in 6 years. This_ I have no doubt_ was due to being propped up by the Avanza(Remeron) and the commencement of some Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (which I highly_ highly recommend).

393, 5, Insomnia/Lack of Appetite depressio,At first I was very sedated even after 9 or 10 hours of sleep.  This only lasted a few days and then I was able to function well.  I think my body had been so deprived of sleep due to insomnia from depression that I needed the extra sleep.  So it was a positive side effect for me.  I also was prescribed this med. to increase my appetite.   I was basically eating nothing and had lost 20 lbs. in a few months.,I am now at a point that I have gained a sufficient amount of weight back and I am sleeping well.  My doctor suggested discontinuing Remeron to avoid any unwanted weight gain.  I also take it as an add-on to Zoloft so I'm hoping that discontinuing it doesn't throw me back into the insomnia.  I would HIGHLY recommend this drug as an add-on for those whose depression causes sleeplessness_ early awakening with panic or anxiety_ and a difficulty if not repulsion to eating.  It will help you get over a difficult hump until a more powerful anti-depressant kicks in.  As for stopping it...well_ I guess I will find out soon. If it wasn't for the issue of the weight gain I would stay on this drug indefinitely because of the benefit to sleep. Wish me luck!,F,40,5  months,8/17/2008,Remeron
394, 5, Anxiety/Panic attacks,I have not had any negative side effects.,Everyone is different and responds in different ways.  I was perscribed Remeron after a horrible experience with Lexapro. My Dr. realized I don't do well with normal SSRI's.  Due to my anxiety I had no appetite and lost a great deal of weight and it was a challenge to get food in my mouth_ what I did eat usually came out rather fast (GI problems due to anxiety/panic). I also was having early morning severe panic attacks and was getting afraid of sleep. Remeron_ on the first night of taking it stopped that.  I am 2 weeks in and my appetite is back to NORMAL.  I am not more hungry than usual_ just like I should be.  I also have not had a panic attack since I started it.  I still have some minor anxiety_ but with therapy and the more time on the drug_ I'm confident it will only get better.  I would reccommend this to people with similar reactions to both anxiety/stress/panic (no eating or sleeping) and if you aren't tolerant to SSRI's.,F,28,2  weeks,8/12/2008Email,Remeron
395, 1, Anxiety_ Depression_ OCD,This drug reversed the delayed orgasm side effect of Lexapro_ which in my case was a bad thing_ but may be something worth pursuing with your doctor if delayed orgasm presents a problem for you.,No effect on my anxiety_ depression_ or OCD. However_ I should note that this was the 20th psychiatric medication I have tried.,M,23,2  months,8/8/2008,Remeron
396, 4, Anxiety_ insomnia and depression,Tingling sensation with loud noises (very uncomfortable and irritating. Have talked to others who've experienced while on the drug) Restless legs about 20 minutes after taking the med. Severe shortness of breath_ drowsiness in the a.m and very_ very vivid dreams (not nightmares)These were my most severe symptoms and they seem to have gone away after 3 weeks of taking the medication.,It definitely helped me sleep though after a couple weeks of taking it I did have trouble sleeping where I would constantly wake through the night. That seems to have gone away. Though I have significantly less anxiety and I am more outgoing and fun than I used to be!,F,25,1  months,8/2/2008,Remeron

399, 1, depression_  anxiety_ fibromyalgia,severe sedation and excessive sleeping,I was taking Effexor 300mg and it was not working anymore.  My doctor decided to add Remeron.  I took one dose of 30mg of Remeron and slept for 2 days straight (seriously_ 48 hrs).  Finally_ my husband was so scared he forced me out of bed to walk around.  I was very dizzy and felt drugged for another day.  It scared me so much I quit taking the medication.,F,44,1  days,7/29/2008,Remeron

Hasn't helped at all. If anything it has only made me worse. I have a high tolerance to medications. Man though_ this one has me bugging out. The RLS_ makes you want to chop off your legs. Yes it does make me sleepy_ but if I am tossing and turning for 3-4 hours it is not helping only making things worse. I am on Lexapro and I think I will stick with that until my next appt. The long term side effects are not worth the risk_ especially since there are so many other medications out there that can help.,F,33,4  months,7/28/2008Email,Remeron
401, 4, insomnia_ anxiety/panic attacks,Very sedating at first (however sedation side effects wane with time)_ lethargy_ increased appetite_ restless leg syndrome first two weeks fortunately went away,Remeron does seem to help to some degree with my anxiety and panic attacks_ but I had to increase the dose and take it 2x daily (15 mg in the morning and 30 mg at night) to have a more consistent effect as it seemed the doses were wearing off quickly.  It doesn't seem to have affected my mood one way or another_ but I'm not taking it for depression.  It has worked wonders on my insomnia (and worked immediately)--I am usually out within a half to one hour of my evening dose--it's as effective if not more so than sleeping pills.  Also_ this medication_ while sedating_ doesn't destroy my sex drive like some other antidepressants did.,M,30,4  months,7/24/2008Email,Remeron
402, 5, Anxiety/Depression,Some leg pain.  Increased appetite,I spent over a year fighting depression and anxiety.  I sought treatment though several different doctors and tried many different medications.  I was already on Cymbalta which was only marginally helping.  My doctor then added Remeron which began to work immediately remarkably after one day.  I have been on it for 6 weeks in conjunction with the Cymbalta.  I hope and pray it continues to work.  It has given me back my life.,F,48,6  weeks,6/30/2008Email,Remeron

404, 3, depression/anxiety,food cravings_ extreme tiredness_ weird dreams_ anger_ weepiness_ suicidal thoughts_ skin very salty_ thirst.,I took this drug a couple of years ago and it was great. This time tho_ it is not helping my depression at all_ i feel like everything i do or say is a huge effort_ like i am acting and not being real.  Eating entire packs of biscuits_ 5 chocolate bars at a time_ etc. Saw an extremely weird black and green monster_ with sharp teeth.....in my dreams. the dreams have stopped now and i feel like i am not having rem sleep.

405, 5, Depression,First few days on the drug_ I walked around in a daze_ and kept hearing a telephone ring. At 15 mg_ I could not keep my eyes open an hour after taking pill. At 30 mg_ for the first few months_ I easily slept 14 hours_ part of which was restless sleep but I was far too drowsy to get up. Drowsiness effect lifted when dosage upped to 45 mg. When I returned to 30mg later_ the drowsiness effects were less. Otherwise_ no weight gain or changes in appetite. Now weaning off drug_ and currently first day of being completely off the drug. Am feeling moments of euphoria followed by moments of lethargy. Hope that settles out over the next while. Anxious about the sleeping effects.,,F,29,2  years,6/21/2008,Remeron
406, 5, Insomnia_ Anxiety_ Depression,Foggy in the morning_ occasionally drowsy and sleepy in the evenings.  Appetite and between-meal snacking has increased_ but moderation and regular excercise has offset any weight gain.,30mg.  Chronic insomnia and night-after-night of poor sleep had only helped to fuel my anxiety and depression.  I was literally coming to my wit's end_ constantly waking up to racing thoughts after only 4 hours of sleep_ unable to get back to sleep; tossing and turning until morning with the anxious thoughts cycling over and over.  Without intending to sound overly clichéd_ Remeron has truly changed my life.  I now get at least 7 hours of solid_ uninterrupted sleep every night.  I forgot what it was like to be awakened by the alarm in the morning_ and just how healing and beneficial sleep is to your body and soul.  Although I'm going through a very stressful time in my life right now_ I have zero anxiety.  The vicious mental cycle that insomnia was only magnifying has dissipated completely_ and I'm fully functional in all aspects of my life.  My thought processes are clear again_ which has led to improved reasoning and verbal communications; things had become so bad_ I felt as tho,M,40,4  weeks,6/21/2008Email,Remeron
407, 5, appetite stimulant,increased appetite_ which is a very good thing for me.  the only side effect is that i have the hardest time getting up in the morning.  that minor side effect is worth it though.,i realize that most people will not be able to sympathize with me_ but i have always had trouble gaining weight_ however_ remeron seems to have solved that problem.  i absolutely love it!  eating is no longer a chore for me.  i have gained 16 lbs in the past 3 months!  i went from 97 lbs to 113 lbs! i can't wait to get to 120 lbs!,F,27,3  months,6/13/2008,Remeron

I do not have a thyroid and I am very sensitive to medications.  I did gained some weight.  It helped me get a good night sleep but because of the dreams at first I was not taking it every day then the dreams got less and I started taking it more frequently but then my blood pressure went up very high 160/110.  We are not sure if the hypertension is from the Remeron or did it impact my thyroid medications where I became hyperthyroid. So my doctor had me come off of it at the same time the lowered my thyroid medication.  This medication helped improve me being happy more then any drug I have tried and trust me I have tried everything since suffering from very bad anxiety/panic attacks since having my thyroid removed which they never were able to get under control since I cannot take 98% of the medication out there because it impact my thyroid medication .

The weight gain isn't a problem since I was down 20 lbs. from not eating. Really helped me sleep. Heard this is best as an add on med to boost another antidepressant rather than by itself - for the seriously deprssed only.

When I was introduced to Remeron my life had completely turned around.  Because of my bouts with depression I would be too sressed to eat as I should and as mentioned by others_ Remeron completely changed that around.  I suddently had an appetite like you wouldn't believe.  For the most part you tend to crave sweet things...carbs.  Depression would effect the quality of my sleep (not enough) thereby ruining my days that much more_ and once again Remeron changed that.  I was more sleepy than was necessary but I eventually got used to it.  I have now been taking Remeron for about 4 years and while I do have concerns that it may effect my concentration_ I can't really prove it.  I could be genuinely bored.,F,25,4  years,5/4/2008,Remeron

However_ at a full dose of 30mg_ that stopped instantly. This drug has worked for me where others did not.  it helped stop the constant flow of negative thoughts_ and after the first few weeks_ I had no side effects.  I am glad I hung in there.

Feel a bit more nervous now_ occasional heart arythmia. Day 4 (1mg) much better_ slept well. Lets see how long this lasts,Need to be very careful with that first dose. Doctors prescribing for just Insomnia should be aware that low doses work best. Start as low as you can. If pill form_ I would suggest just a sliver of the pill for the first night.

Which ended up in me having a serious panic attack to the point of me not being able to breathe. I also gained about 25 pounds in less then a month_ which isn't that horrible seeing as I was at least 10 pounds underweight to start with_ but I feel like it's too much way to fast.

Ten to twelve pounds of fat settled around my middle in thirty days.  It still will not disappear... no matter how hard I work out.  I eat healthy and in moderation... but to no effect. If I could sue these damn drug companies I would. These companies minimize some side effects and deny other side effects even exist at all...

It's a great low dose combination for me.I really am happy this drug.  Why take a high dose of 1 medicine when a low dose of 2 working together is more effective?

Months later_ I'm still dealing with strong throbs triggered by saccadic eye movements for 10-15 minutes after emerging from REM sleep_ as well as general disorientation during the day.  Mirtazapine was highly disruptive to my brain_ and I consider it neurotoxic.,M,55,14  days,1/31/2008,Remeron

I took Remeron in 1999 for only 1 month_ and I still have  problems with swelling in my ankles at random times_ several days a month -- I never had this problem before Remeron.,The worst drug ever.

I've had a huge appetite and a 10 pound weight gain.,My problem was that I'd wake up during the night and not be able to go back to sleep.  I had tried Ambien and Lunesta and couldn't function the next day due to dizziness and total fog.  Remeron works for me.

I should weigh 185 lbs_ and if it weren't for the daily running_ I would probably weigh 240lbs or so.

451, 4, depression_ insomnia_ wight loss,At 30 mg - increased restlessness_ need to move around_ mood swings_ increased appetite for wrong food (choko)_ permanent weight gain,This is an update from June 13_ 2007. Since end of December 2006 I was weaning off of remeron. Took 15 mg a couple of times in a month_ 4 months was without remeron. However_ in November my paresthesia in the right leg get so bad that doctor supposed that my depression is back and advised me to take Cymbalta. I tried 1 capsule and diceded to take remeron again. Sol Tabs are not available in my place_ so I just took 15 mg under the tongue until dissolving. In the mean time I asked doctor to check my thiroid (It is known that hypothiroidism is linked to depression). Yes_ it is my case. Since December 29_ 2007_ I am taking 25 mg of thiroid hormone. It worked from the first day! Since paresthesia and insomnia remained I decided to try trazodone (perscribed by the doctor). It seems to work without considerable side effects. Advise all elderly women to check thiroid gland. Happy New Year to all!,F,62,1.5  years,1/9/2008Email,Remeron

Yes_ she still has soul but you gotta dig deep to find it. Before the drug she was conflicted and depressed at times but her feelings ( though very difficult at times ) and prayer always managed to pull her through.,Yes it saved her life several different times. When psychically speaking she couldn't hold it together. But to be destined to be on it for the rest of her life seems extreme. If she were given a plecebo I don't think she'd notice the difference. And  with continued psyco/social support ( which she recieves a good deal of) I beleive she could regain some of her vitality or life force.,F,76,12  years,12/29/2007Email,Remeron

I am eating about 1600 cal a day and working out 5 days per week -- stationary bike 3 miles and rapid walking 1-2 miles a day_ weights 3 times a week.  I have not really gained_ but have not lost.  I can't understand why I am not losing more. I do not have a weight problem_ only wanted to lose about 7 pounds.  I would hate to think what I would have gained if not very active.  Taking 30 Mg before bed -- and drug has REALLY helped me get my life back together after ending a bad relationship.  Within a week of starting drug 3 mo ago_ I felt my mood lifting and I could sleep really well.  I felt like going to the gym again and am taking much better care of my body again. A bit groggy in the AM and a little fuzzy feeling all day_ but I worked 40 hours a week and took three college classes with 2 A's and a B_ so it wasn't bad at all.

My mood have greatly improved_ and I have the mental calm to work in therapy. The side-effects were horrid for a while_ but I'm glad I stood through them. I have gained 5 kilos in 7 weeks (which I hate) and I need insane amounts of coffee to wake me up in the mornings. But I sleep soundly now_ which is good (about 5 hours pr night just worsened my depression).

Periods of good feelings_ but not long lasting.,This med has helped my insomnia after yrs of benzo drugs and withdrawal from.  Started on 15mg upped to 30mg noticed much higher anxiety so decreased back to 15.  Don't really like the way I feel on this_ plan is to get off this soon! Using it to get thru my benzo w/d and hope to rid anti d's. May use this for insomnia at low dose as needed. Since lowering the big bloated belly has decreased!  its the antihistimne higher dose the culprit? Wake up time feel confused and don't care for the vivid dreams. Not a fan of drugs and how they alter chemicals this much_ but_ had to resort to something for insomnia as nothing else has worked. The huge appetite has decreased but still find sweats a first choice_ urgh. about 6 lbs in 5 wks gained. If the weight gain would settle and bloating_ plus anxiety level stays low would consider staying on the low dose. For me more is not better. Initial start up was like most say_ VERY sedating_ still gives me a bit of a knock out but not fully anymore.,F,51,5  days,12/15/2007,Remeron

Then my doctor prescribed Remeron Sol Tab_ and I immediately slept much better and all the side effects pretty much subsided_ except I still had bad short term memory. Then I tried Remeron liquid form and that was just great. I lost half of the weight I had gained in a couple of weeks. My memory came back. So I really recommend the liquid form. And it's easy to taper down_ since you don't have to cut pills. The physical symptoms of my rampant anxiety are gone. It took about 6 months on 30 mg. I'm trying to taper down now_ and have successfully reduced to 22.5 in 3 weeks. I just hope the insomnia doesn't come back! That's all I wish for in this life.,F,33,12  months,12/13/2007,Remeron

I heard that Remeron may help sleeping_ so I jumped at the chance to try it.  It's only helped in my sleep one and half nights.  I still wake up a lot in the middle of night and can't get back to sleep. As far as side effects_ I have had dizziness and achiness this week_ and not much energy.  But it feels like those symptoms are lessening.  Time will tell.  My doctor has me still taking my Zoloft and taking Remerol at night.  He wants to give it about 3 weeks then evaluate.,Has anyone noticed a change in taste?  About how long does it take for the initial side effects to leave?

I'm afraid it's lost all effectiveness...but for those that are using Remeron for deep dark depression_ good for you_ it's a good medication and deserves a lot of credit for saving a lot of lives.

The diet helped me tremendously; lost the initial 12 pounds plus another three melted away over the next two months.

I had a solid sleep but had night sweats.  I woke up feeling like I had taken Benedryl. Tiredness lasted all day. Been taking 7.5mg for 3 days and I'm still tired thoughout the day.  Appetite hasn't increased but food_ especially sugary foods taste better which will inevitably lead to weight gain.  Mood is okay.  Not depressed but not feeling so happy either because I'm so tired and I just want to sleep all day.  Supposed to start on 15mg again on day 7.  Not sure I will if I'm still tired all day or if my depression hasn't gotten worse. Will have to ask dr. since I want to be on as little medication as possible anyway.  I think Remeron has the potential to be good if I can get passed the drowsiness and not get fat! *Not as bad as starting Paxil_ Wellbutrin_ Elavil or Zoloft.

Because of my sensitivity to medications I decided to start the drug in a very small dosage. I dissolved one 15mg tablet into 50ml of water. One drop equates to .015mg. For starters I tried 8 drops before going to sleep and that had a major sedating effect and it reduced the intestinal spasms. As the spasms reduced I cut back to 5 drops_ then 3 then 2 over 11 months (In total I took no more than 30mg in 11 months_ a micro dose. Most people have 2 enzymes in their liver. I have three so I dont metabolize large dosages of drug well. I was advised to take baby doses.)

My craving for sweets in particular became so severe while taking this drug_ on one occasion I even ate brown sugar right out of the bag - no joke!

I've been taking Remeron about a week to 10 days now-and even with half dose I am really feeling awful side effects.  I will probably stop taking it soon as the side effects are too difficult for me_ I don't seem to tolerate this medication very well.  It also impairs my ability to function_ walk_ drive etc.  The rash_ pounding heart_ and swollen foot really concern me; as they are probaly direct effects from Remeron.  Most of the time I feel out of it_ zombie-like and confused_ persecuted.  Hard to talk_ feel a huge block with speaking.  There were some benefits I noticed for awhile_ which made it hard to know whether to keep taking it or not.

489, 4, Major Depression,Increased appetite_ drowsiness in morning_ vivid dreams or nightmares (decreased after few weeks).,I love Remeron. Paxil and Cymbalta didn't work. Wellbutrin helped_ but raised blood pressure dramatically. Effexor can do the same (& raise eye pressure). So we went with 15 mg of Remeron at night & 40 mg of Prozac in the morning. If your doc combines meds the Prozac reduces your appetite_ while Remeron increases it_ so you don't eat so much. I started to improve SLOWLY.  We continued with 15 mg Remeron at night but tapered the Prozac down_ and substituted 10 mg Lexapro in the day. This combination pulled me out of the depression. Remeron is a good med because of few side effects. It will also help you sleep if you have anxiety. You will have to exercise and eat more fruits and vegetables rather than carbs or you will gain weight. Remeron is available in generic at Wal-Mart for about $35 for 30 30mg pills (you can split them). Dosage can be increased up to 45 mg if necessary. Wal-Mart also has generic Prozac for $4 for 30 40mg pills (yes_ $4). Lexapro is expensive_ but get the,M,47,12  weeks,8/27/2007,Remeron

I had an incredible urge to eat ""something"" but nothing was satifying enough.  Three months ago I started getting the sudden anger/rage feelings.  I would get so angry at the smallest thing_ I would fight like my life depended on it.  The build up of this incredible rage caused fight after fight with my boyfriend_ to the point where I would scream and get very violent.

Lowered sex drive.,"Overall_ I really like this drug.  I've tried Celexa_ Wellbutrin in the past.  Wellbutrin actually intensified my anxiety and would make me very irritable.  Celexa did nothing except make it impossible to have an orgasm.  Remeron clipped my anxiety almost immediately_ but it does not seem to lift depression that effectively.  But_ just removing the crushing anxiety was a major move toward feeling better. (I used to self-medicate with a 12 pack/night)  Changes in the way I ""sense"" hunger - like it's hard to be satisfied by a meal unless it is finished by a lot of sweets carbs.  I take 30mg with 300mg Neurontin.  Really sleep well.  I'd say it is most effective or anxiety and sleep disorders.  I may try augmenting with Welbutrin to see how ""broth"" comes out.

Remeron is one of the only modern depressants which apparently does not cause delayed ejaculation or loss of libido in men.  However_ when I took it_ I noticed that sexual pleasure was not as good as before I took it. The biggest problems with Remeron is the weight gain. Even if I exercised_ I continued to put on weight. Even my arms swelled up ... I am tall so I could hide it_ but got sick of the trousers getting tighter and tighter around the waste. The cravings were weird too. Like at 11pm at night I could convince myself I needed a huge bwol of popcorn covered in icing sugar.  Or eating a whole tray of biscuits in one sitting and still not feeling sastisfied.

It seems to increase my appetite at night_ although it's hard to tell because I normally have a very healthy appetite when there is no adderall in my system.  I still don't have an appetite during the day when the adderall is still in my system.

It doesn't help me fall asleep anymore_ but once I'm out_ I'm out.  I tried 30 mg for a few weeks and it helped my mood alot_ but it made me extremely irritable.  I felt like my fingernails were on too tight.,It made a significant improvement in my mood.  I was far less depressed.  I was barely functional when I started it.

It would make me go on sugar binges that lasted for days--I literally ate brown sugar out of the bag and whole bags of chocolate a day. I quickly gained 70 pounds in just 4 months! I developed horrible edema from the water retention and started an extreme exercise program--walking 4 miles a day and eating only 1_400 calories a day. The weight still would not come off and continued to increase in smaller amounts. Besides the weight gain_ I found myself laughing hysterically in inapprpriate situations. (Like if the dog would chew up something at my mom's house_ I thought it was hilarious).

Has reduced my panic attacks and axiety both. I gained a ton of weight in the first year but have managed to slowly lose the majority of it. In addition to helping my anxiety_ I feel like the Remeron did 2 things -- it increased my appetite a little and perhaps slowed my metabolism down a little also. The result on a person who has struggled with weight all her life was OBESITY. With a major committment to healthy eating and moderate exercise_ I have lost 2/3 of the weight and am still going strong. It IS possible to lose weight on this stuff_ but it takes a real effort! Regardless_ I feel like the calming of my panic-prone nature is great thing. I can cope with things better and my panic attacks are few and far between.

I am starting to get concerned about the weight gain and have spoken to my doctor about it. Even when I control what I eat_ the weight still comes on.

First pill made me feel completely cooked and hung over all day (shouldn't have taken in in the morning before work!). Excellent as a sleep aid other than the vivid/surreal dreams I have been experiecing (often sexual). That part of it seems to make me not have a deep enough of a sleep.

Taking 1mg of clonazopem (Rivotril) before bed seems to help me sleep deeper but then I wake up feeling too tired.

Craving for carbohydrates (chokolate_ sweets) like being pregnant. Restlessness in day time. Inability to laugh or yawn (!). Didn't completely cure the insomnia. Last June I began to take 3 mg of Melaxen at bed time with 15 mg of Remeron. This combination gave me undisturbed night sleep.,Remeron saved my life_ since I couldn't eat or drink at all and lost 10 kg in about 3 weeks of severe depression and insomnia. Slowly_ but it braught me back to life within 2 years. 2 weeks ago I stopped taking Remeron. Craving for sweets persists. It's difficult to fall asleep_ though I take 3 mg of Melaxen. I wake up at about 3 a.m._ and then fall asleep again. Strange but I can laugh and yawn again. It may be just coincidence_ but I developed severe back pains.

It made me sleep_ but seemed not to work for depression. It didn't help with nausea and womiting_ too. I gained about 20 pounds in 2 months_ changed to Cipramil (1 month). It didn't help either.

571, 5, Generalized Anxiety and Insomnia,Next day was a mental fog and apathy for the first 3 weeks.  Then that subsided and I now feel more alert during the day than I did before starting Remeron (Mirtazapine).  I attribute that to the fact that I now regularly get a full nights sleep.  It takes 4 alarm clocks to wake me in the morning.  But it is worth it to be able to sleep solidly.  More dreams.  But no nightmares.,It cured my generalized anxiety.  And therefore I also quit having the tension headaches that came with anxiety.  As a bonus_ my dry itchy legs quit itching.  Presumably due to Remeron's affinity for histamine receptors.I take 15mg each night.  If I take it on an empty stomach_ I get nauseous and dizzy.  If I take it with dinner_ I have no problem.  I presume this is just due to a slowing of the absorption. I've had no increase in appetite or weight gain.You don't want to drive a car for the first 3 weeks.

Side effects while taking this medicine: brain fog_ lethargy_ loss of social interest_ decreased anxiety_ occasional panic attacks late in the day_ which I suspect were due to the drug being cleared by the end of the day(I took it at bedtime).,Tried to quit cold turkey after too many panic attack episodes_ one requiring me to call 911 in the middle of my drive home from work. During the first 7-9 days off the medication (after 7 months on it) I began to get slightly depressed_ tingling on the top of my head_ and occasional slight nausea. Because I couldn't sleep by the 10th night_ I took 1/4 tab that night. Woke up feeling like I was hit by a train. Over the next 3 days this did not clear_ and I also developed serious tremors_ sweating_ clammy hands and brain fog. These symptoms kept me out of work and without the ability to function normally. I'm now on day 17 and am slowly getting back on remeron in hopes to function enough to go to work again. I'll have to taper off - even at my low dosage - for weeks_ possibly months.

It is very hard for me to wake up for work and school_ but I have adjusted.  30 minutes after I take it_ I get REALLY hungry_ usually for sweets.,I love this medicine; however_ I do not thinkg I could go to sleep without it or live my life without it.  In a way_ that is unsettling because no one wants to feel they 'have' to take a medicine just to sleep or be happy.  Hope this was helpful... Remeron has really helped me and even though there are some negative side effects_ being happy outweighs those any day.,F,21,5  years,6/30/2006,Remeron
617, 4, Anxious depression,I took this when I was 21-22 years old.  About a half hour after I took it_ nothing in the world could keep me awake.  I had to sleep at least 10 hours_ 12 was better.  I ate relentlessly--I would wake up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and grab 5 cookies on the way back to bed. It was the most fun 20 pounds I ever gained. If something startled me it felt like a full-body electric shock_ with afterwaves that lasted several seconds.  I was relaxed and content but pretty out of it_ detached and indifferent.,I decided to stop taking it because I got an offer for a real job with responsibilities (instead of the menial job I had been working before)and I knew I couldn't function at that high of a level while taking Remeron.  Also the depression had started to creep back.  If I was ever at the end of my rope again_ I would consider taking Remeron again_ because for anxious depression it was an incredibly powerful drug.  Incidentally_ Wellbutrin helped reverse the weight gain.,F,26,3  months,6/26/2006,Remeron

The SSRI component kick s in pretty harsh at that point.  I'm on 15mg right now and thinking I need to go up to 30 because of some depression and increased anxiety. I'm hopeful at this point that I just need an increase in dosage and that the drug has not stopped working on me.  The side effects have been worth it for me.,F,35,5  years,6/21/2006,Remeron

621, 1, Sleep related,Sleepy! sleepy! sleepy! Felt like I was in a living coma. Couldn't wake up_ felt tired after getting up in the morning. Low libido_ no sexual desire immediataly after taking this pill. Constant state of numbness.  Slept great! Just wanted to do it all the time.,Upon taking my first pill I felt I was in a DRUG STUPOR.  I loved the sleep I was experiencing ... didn't even get up to go the bathroom in the middle of the night! Had to STOP TAKING THIS MEDICATION after three days_ my life was passing me by and I slept all day and couldn't wait to go back to bed at night.  Still AFTER STOPPING THIS MEDICATION_ I'M EXPERIENCING DRUG HANGOVER! I hate it! I don't even want to plant flowers!! I still wake up wanting to go back to bed. I have no sexual appetite. I've gained weight in two days and crave sweets. This would be a great drug for anyone who wants to sleep_ gain weight and not have sex.  I want more than that in life and will tackle my issues on my own.  I will never take this drug again.  My husband is on Paxil and climaxing is a thing of the past (so far) these drugs are robbing us of our passion and zest for life. It isn't all about sleep I guess.  I always thought if I could get a good nights sleep_ all would be better.  I think I need more,F,45,3  days,6/4/2006,Remeron

My psychiatrist said that means I'm bipolar_ b/c antidepressants cause rage in bipolar people.  However_ my only symptom is insomnia due to sleep anxiety.  For the rest of you who experienced rage_ what did your psychiatrist say about it?  Did they say you were bipolar or that was a common side effect?  Thanks for your comments!,F,31,1  days,5/8/2006Email,Remeron
626, 4, Anxiety_ depression,Very significant weight gain over two periods using the drug.  Went from 145 to 185_ went off the drug and lost a little_ then went back on and went to 245 (basically went from normal weight for my age/height to quite fat).  Tried efexor in between remeron episodes and had a severe alergic reaction to it.  Remeron makes me unable to resist high-carb foods.  Diet and exercise don't seem to work while on the drug_ and work very little for me when off.,Other than the considerable weight gain_ remeron has significantly helped me.  For me_ it is very subtle in taking the edge off day-to-day stresses_ and particularly balancing my reaction to big stresses.  I'm learning to deal with the weight_ and have kind of resigned myself to being fat.  Being fat is far better for me than what I was going through emotionally before.  My family could hardly stand to be around me.  Everything set me off.  Now that's in balance_ I'm fat_ but overall happier.  My advice: if it works for you and the only negative is the weight_ deal with the weight.,F,47,2.5  years,4/24/2006,Remeron

""Hangover""-like feeling.  Restlessness and difficulty sleeping.",I am being evaluated for Bipolar I disorder. Remeron was given to me along with Lithium (a mood stabilizer) as an alternative to Wellbutrin and to Prozac. Though I did feel less depressed_ the medication induced a manic state in me very quickly_ though I was only on it for 2 days.  I believe this medication would work fine for Depression_ but at this point I can't use it without increasing my mood stabilizer.I would advise someone taking REMERON for Depression to keep on the medication if it helps you feel better_ but if you notice anger_ irritation or anything like that_ to notify your doctor_ as this med does induce mania_ and carries such a warning on it's labeling.Now that I am off the medication_ the majority of the side effects have worn off_ but I now have a sore mouth and my tongue feels as though I have bitten it several times.,F,36,2  days,4/22/2006,Remeron

I can laugh a belly laugh. I love the way it helps me sleep. It helps some with the pain of fibromyalgia_ probably because I sleep_ although I will always have fibromyalgia pain.

635, 4, Idiopathic Non-Restorative Sleep,Minor decrease in libido; mild to moderate weight gain.,Tolerance to sedative effect occurs within about eight weeks.  Continues to provide restorative sleep long-term by increasing stages three and four (a.k.a. slow wave sleep).  These are important sleep stages because this is when growth hormone is released by the pituitary gland that repairs muscles and gives you this feeling of having slept well.  One important item of interest that is rarely noted is that Remeron reduces cortisol secretion after acute administration.  Cortisol is a stress hormone that is implicated in sleep disturbances.  Withdrawal returns sleep patterns to baseline levels.,M,30,7  months,3/16/2006,Remeron
636, 3, Depression_ anxiety_ sleeplessness,Spots_ suicidal thoughts (well_ I was suicidal anyway)_ shaky hands_ sleepiness_ loss of friends_ hunger (first month of treatment)_ paranoia_ no more tearfulness_ (i'd cry every day_ a few times a day before I was put on remeron). Feeling better generally_ but be careful when dose is adjusted. Tell your friends so they know your crazy behaviour might be down to your medication_ or you'll lose them.,It's amazing if you can't sleep. You'll have the most vivid dreams_ you won't lie awake dwelling on things_ just dream. However_ on the third night of taking it I felt worse than ever (suicidal) but I was knocked out by the sedative effects so I stumbled into bed before I could do anything stupid. Things got better_ I felt like I was on a high for weeks until the dose was doubled (after 4 weeks). 4 nights later I became suicidal again_ triggered by something quite minor (in hindsight). I was in floods of tears and angry and felt worthless and out of control_ it was like I was possessed. Not like suicide ideation_ more total despair and feeling like you can't possibly go on for another minute. I was in such despair I didn't have the presence of mind to be able to do anything stupid. I was out of it. Things are okay now. I'm hoping this is just down to the change in dosage and that it'll even out in a few days.

Before I would 'loop' over thoughts that would drive me nuts_ would get very excitable and manic. The same would make me stay awake for days. Remeron for me seems to allow a more fluid thought process_ with less obsessing on details. I find my thoughts have mellowed_ and i now feel comfortable in my skin. So far_ this seems to be the right tweek for my chemicals_ it's a pitty that it seems to be trial and error on the doctor's part.It would be better for a doctor to do a test on the balance of your neurochemisty before trying a 'lets see what happens' approach_ as I think the more negative reports are more to say_ that remeron may tip the balance_ the wrong way.

I've been on Remeron since 2001 and am pretty much dependent on it - it took a few months to work_ but it did. I was better_ had eaten better and it controlled my insomnia.

When I started Remeron_ it took about 2 weeks to become fully effective_ but suddenly I felt like living again and I felt like eating and I slept at night and I looked forward to the future.  I felt less anxious too. What wonderful changes.   I have always had trouble sleeping and had anxiety problems (even when I was a kid)_ so I may probably always take it for those problems.

Taking Remeron was a nightmare for me and it didn't even help with depression or anxiety.  I became uncontrollably angry over the tiniest things and I also cried for no reason.

It doesn't seem to make me sleepy_ or increase the depth of my sleep_ rather it is making me feel kind of spacey and calmer. I'm going to give it a while and see how my body adjusts to it.

662, 5, Insomnia_ depression_ benzo w/d,Very slow onset_ increase to 45mg caused agitation_ not really fixed my sleeping,"This is an update to my rating below about rising to 45mg and Valium withdrawal. Initially_ on raising the dose_ I noticed that agitation increased and I put myself back on 30mg. I stayed on this for a few weeks_ but noticed my depression got worse_ and my sleeping was far from perfect. So_ under the advice from my doctor_ I tried 45mg again. I still got ""agitated"" (nervous. jumpy_ etc.) after about seven days_ but after about 10_ it disappeared and I felt better than I have in years. To all those who give up after a few days_ start low and increase and don't expect quick miracles. That happens for some_ clearly_ but not all. My sleeping still isn't perfect_ with a lot of waking up_ but it's less of a problem (I worry about it less and get back to sleep right away).",M,35,4  months,10/18/2005,Remeron
663, 1, social anxiety disorder; insomnia,Dry mouth_ blurred vision_ dizziness_ drowsiness_ cravings for sweets_ delayed ejaculation_ and INCREASED ANXIETY.,"I started taking remeron when my social anxiety was preventing me from going places (mall_ movies_ school). They told me it would help with my insomnia too_ and it did the first night_ it made me feel almost like I was drunk_ but not as dizzy. After that_ it didn't help my insomnia much at all. Since I started taking it my anxiety has actually gotten worse_ and my panic attacks are so frequent they've now been trying different PRNs for me. I'm thirsty all the time_ my vision is blurry and lights look much brighter to me all the time (except natural sunlight)_ I tend to be dizzy if I hadn't been standing most of the day_ I have even less energy than I used to_ and worst of all it takes me forever to ejaculate during sex. I also get a tingling feeling in my extremeties_ including my tongue_ but that might also be because I've been craving sweets a lot. That's not so bad though because I still haven't gained any weight (something I actually wanted; I'm 5'9"" and I weigh only 110). Rem",M,16,4  months,10/16/2005,Remeron

No sexual side effects at all.,I didn't believe my doctor that this pill would knock me out cold_ help me sleep and stop me from yelling and screaming and stop the paranoia that everyone was against me. I was taking anywhere from 8-10 unisom a night and was affraid I would never be able to stop_ they were costing me a fortune. I have not touched them in 3 weeks since day one taking Remeron. I am at 45mg a night and sleep 8 hours with not one interuption and no drowsiness. Even with the Unisom I didn't sleep soundly and was very restless. This has saved my life and my relationship with my family. I have some days where I relapse but they are over very fast. I am no longer depressed and I feel like I am finally living again.

665, 1, migraine headaches_ insomnia,EXTREME sleeping...absolutely unable to get up and function for the day. Major hangover effect...I would imagine that this is what it feels like to come off of crack or LSD. Food cravings out of control.,I was put on Remeron for my migraines after Topamax kept me up all night and Trazadone made me sleep too long. My doctor put me on a 7.5mg dosage to start with. I just took it last night for the first time. I took half a pill at 10:00PM and by 10:30 I was passed out. I remember trying to get some work done before bed and having to stumble over to my bed. My alarm went off all morning until my roommate came in and literally DRUG me out of the bed. I tried going to class (I'm a college student) and had to be driven home by a friend after flat out falling asleep in class. Before crashing again_ I felt the need to devour tons of junk food. I then crashed for another 5 hours_ bringing the grand total of Remeron-induced sleep for the day up to 16 hours. I woke up and felt drugged and hungover. I still feel like that_ and I feel excessively hungry. I'm going off of it after only one pill--this is ridiculous.

667, 1, Anxiety,The first time I took Remeron_ I took it before bed time. The day after_ I woke up with a very dry mouth_ and vison impairement.  I just could not see.  My vision was blurry - it felt exactly as when you have eye exams done_ and get eye drops to dilate your pupils.  The vision problems lasted for about a week. I was also feeling confused and my reflexes seemed slow.  It felt almost as if I drank too much alcohol.  The most impressive about all these symptoms_ was that I had only taken half a tablet of the minimum dosage! After a few days taking Remeron I experienced nightmares_ and had a few times the experience of dreaming and trying to wake up_ but couldn't. Though I was 100% councious_ I simply could not make my body respond to my brain.  It was as if my brain was awake_ but by limbs were asleep.  It was pretty scary. I was constantly sleepy_ and slept an average of 12 hours per night. Another thing that happened to me_ while taking Remeron_ was that I had a horrific panick attack -,I will never take Remeron again.  Taking it_ was the scariest experience I've ever had.  I felt as if I was under LSD (though I've never tried to take any drugs in my life).,F,36,6  days,9/14/2005Email,Remeron

Hard to separate the initial effects of Remeron with the benzo w/d - but initially_ I slept great on 15mg (3 weeks) and felt better and better as time went by. (I say ""great""_ but this means sleeping right away but still waking several times.) As I reduced Klonopin over time (prescribed with the Remeron to help with the w/d)_ I increased Remeron to 30mg from weeks 3-5 and still slept well; although I did wake most nights_ I was able to sleep again. Given the disturbed sleep_ my Dr raised the dosage to 45mg and no change_ although my daily anxiety and stress has gone. I do have constant back pain_ but that could be work (on PCs).  It's now been two months and I do feel better_ but I will have to raise the back pain issue with the doc as well as the fact that I am still not sleeping quite right next time.

678, 3, sleep disorder_ depression,intense fatigue_ spaced-out feeling_ dry mouth,7.5 mg of this drug does help sleep. i was stunned that i fell asleep pretty deeply about 30 min after taking it_ very unusual for me. i felt as though i slept more deeply_ but_ unfortunately_ i woke dead tired after 7.5 hrs_ almost like i only slept for 2. my workday was ruined_ and caffeine did not even help. the reason i need a med that helps sleep is to give me some alertness during the day_ so being tired all day essentially made me worse. also_ this daytime fatigue issue may improve over time_ but i cannot just take 2-4 weeks out of my life right now to find out.appetite--i did not have that reaction that others complain about with uncontrollable sugar cravings.  yes_ cake and sweets tasted extra good_ and protein like chicken tasted very bland. but i was able to avoid sugar for the days on the meds. i always wonder if some who take antidepressants are so depressed they are not eating_ and suddenly their appetite comes back with a vengeance? not sure_ but my appetite was still nearly the same.depression--i was too tired to sense if remeron truly helped my depression_ [and i did not take it long] but even in the brief time i took it_ i noticed feeling on a more even keel.maybe someday when i can take weeks out of my life off to try meds_ i'll try remeron again_ but for now_ it's a no. there are too many other meds out there.,F,40,3  days,8/11/2005,Remeron

Drug doesnt help anxiety/depression but with psycho therapy I am trying to control anxiety.  Havent been depressed since I quit the job that triggered panic/anxiety/ which led to depression.  Life is better now.  Dont know the long term affects as I'll prob have to take anti depressants all my life.  I found this site looking up comments on Zyban to help me quit smoking_ not sure if I want to give up Remeron for Zyban.  Maybe I'll take both_ will ask doctor next time.  Was on effexor before this and that drug is awful_ coming off was awful.  It did help with anxiety and I hear is a good drug for replace crack cocaine.

But the groggy/dizzy is not unpleasant.,Withdrawal is pretty bad for something that the official literature says is not addictive or dependency creating. I've been on it for over five years at 15mg/day (higher at times). Withdrawal symptoms for me is pretty much limited to a permanent stomach cramp_ especially bad in the morning.

690, 3, depression_ anxiety,weight gain_ feeling hungover in the morning and sometimes through the day_ anxious legs_ later: eczema-like rash on the thighs_ bad pain in the knee joints_ lower back,I had no experience with depression and anxiety_ thus no experience with antidepressants_ before I went on Remeron. I cannot say for sure if my depression has been or was clinical and not temporary and induced by the immediate circumstances_ and so cannot say exactly if Remeron helped or it just passed as the situation improved. Sleep never had been the problem_ but I have tended to oversleep and Remeron didn't help with that. Anxiety disappeared almost momentarily. Mood-wise_ feel again like myself (but can't attribute to Remeron for sure). Heavy hangover feeling the next day sometimes. My head feels very heavy in the morning_ as if there's a paper weight right over my eyelids_ headache. Low platelet count (though not dangerously low). Very worried about the rash on my thighs and the pain - can't say if it's from Remeron either. Weight gain has been problematic_ but appetite is mostly back to normal for about a month now. Would appreciate it if someone with back ache could describe it a bit more specifically_ also if someone with apparently Remeron-induced rash would describe it with a bit more detail (my e-mail is provided). Have forgotten to take it on a couple of occasions (usually take 30 mg two or three hours before sleep to avoid anxious legs syndrome that makes it difficult to fall asleep)_ and haven't felt any adverse effects_ just continued the next evening.,F,29,3  months,5/22/2005Email,Remeron

CONS: sleeping too much (12 to 14 hours!); not able to wake up and/or get up in the morning; feels like I'm drunk 1 hour after taking (good tasting!) pill. FUTURE: will stop taking if prevents from getting up in the morning (can't afford to loose job if arriving too late every day); will go on taking if it doesn't interfere 2 much with libido/sex and if proves better than ALL OTHER things taken in the past 10 years!

703, 1, Depression,Extremely dry mouth_ experience some confusion_ feel somewhat inebriated all the time_ frequently,Remeron has helped some with the depression_ but the weight gain has been such a negative_ that it undermines the good it has done.  Health issues are too important to ignore.  I pop sugarless candy almost constantly in an effort to get relief from dry mouth.  The sleep has been wonderful_ dreams have been very vivid_ including nightmares (some real doozies).  Takes a long time to get going in the morning.

704, 1, Depression,Extremely dry mouth_ experience some confusion_ feel somewhat inebriated all the time_ feel more anger_ weight gain of 15 pounds_ increase of cholesteral and triglycerides (out of range).,Remeron has helped some with the depression_ but the weight gain has been such a negative_ that it undermines the good it has done.  Health issues are too important to ignore.  I pop hard sugarless candy almost constantly in an effort to get relief from dry mouth.  The sleep has been wonderful_ dreams have been very vivid_ including nightmares (some real doozies).  Takes a long time to get going in the morning.

I ate SO MUCH crap...cookies_ chips...I couldn't seem to get enough.  This is EVIL_ EVIL EVIL medication. Do not take it unless you are desperate!,I only had one dose--I can't even imagine taking this for longer--please please please think twice before you take this!  You   WILL crave carbs...I thought I could battle the cravings but I lost that battle...the drug won! I am still not feeling well (took 15 mg two nights ago) but I will start feeling better soon...went to my natropathic doctor...I am tired of being the drug company's guinea pig.,F,33,1  days,2/23/2005,Remeron

But the really good news is YOU CAN COME off these things and after 7 weeks I have never felt better (still have slight anxiety but it is easily manageable).  So if you are coming off these things_ I wont lie to you_ it is not easy but the rewards are WELL worth it.  You will get there in the end.,Overall experiance.  Whilst on this medication my anxiety was reduced to a low level_ but I felt very irritable and tired (not to mention hungry all the time).  Withdraw was uncomfortable for a period of around four weeks_ then things began to get better.  Withdraw effect encountered were as follows_ trouble sleeping_ anxiety_ strange emotional feelings (normal feelings that you experiance in every day life seem magnified_ this is because remeron removes these feelings so it takes a while to get use to them again but dont let it bother you)and forgetful.,M,36,1  years,2/20/2005Email,Remeron

The second night I had the most vivid nightmare I have ever had.  I liked that I at least slept.After the second pill which was 15mg_ I could hardly function.  I wanted to sleep all the time and developed flu-like symptoms.I also noticed I was hungry all the time.  I don't weigh alot for my body frame_ but had already gained six pounds in one month from Cymbalta which did not help me sleep at all.

I went up to 45mg and that was better but I still suffered daytime lethargy and irritability.  I went up to 60mg on my own and it's been great!  I asked my Dr. to prescribe me 60mg but he said he wouldn't because the FDA didn't recommend going higher than 45mg because of the Heart.  I'm going back to 45mg tonight and i'm very worried about the side effects.,,M,37,2  months,2/14/2005,Remeron

Weight gain_ couldn't get enough to eat_ turned me into a compulsive eater.  I'm not happy about that.  The sense of well-being though is phenomenal.  Now I think that may outweigh the weight gain part but I'm still deciding.  Starting an activating antidepressant (Wellbutrin) tomorrow to try to counteract weight aspect.  Not quite willing to give up Remeron yet because of the sense of well-being_ not argumentative_ listen better_ less opinionated.,F,52,5  months,1/20/2005,Remeron

Doctor tried to add Prozac to the mix but it made my anxiety much worse. Now stopping Prozac and going to try Seroquel to see if it helps. Am a little concerned that my weight may start to creep up again as the weight gain stopped with the Prozac.,F,29,6  months,1/13/2005,Remeron
723, 2, mild depression,Constant hunger_ especially for sweets/carbs which I'm not supposed to eat due to genetic disposition to diabetes. I'm taking Remeron (30mg) presently_ but intend to stop and seek alternative treatments such as 5-HTP_ Relora_ St. John's Wort_SAM-e or anything natural. A consistent exercise regimen will likely work as well for me to lessen depression. I'll deal with the insomnia by taking Valerian Root_ Oatstraw Herbal Tea_ Hops_Chamomile_ and/or Melatonin. My interest in sex has diminished_ though not to the extent that I experienced with Paxil_ which had me 'spitting dust'_ void of all sensation.,As anti-depressants go_ I think it may be one of the better ones_ though I can't speak from vast experience regarding anything other than Paxil. Once you've adjusted to the sedative effects_ it does seem to heighten mood and cease 'tearful' episodes. But still_ I prefer to try a natural_ alternative method_ and intend to do so.,M,48,2  months,1/11/2005Email,Remeron

725, 4, depression_ insomnia,increased appetite_ weight gain_ some irritability,I have tryed Zoloft and Paxil for my depression in the past and both have not helped or have made worse.  My doctor put me on Remeron when I told her the Paxil wasn't working and I started having alot of problems sleeping despite the fact that I also take Klonopin at night for my Panic Disorder and to help me sleep.  It seems my body got used to it and nothing would help me sleep and my depression was still there.  Since I am taking Remeron I sleep like a log all night and I wake up feeling good_ not groggy... kind of like Ambien. I would reccomend this medication if you have depression and sleep problems because you will sleep.  And if you need to gain weight_ this helps...I can't stop eating_ but it makes me happy because I want to gain weight cuz I'm barely 105 lbs.  I have already gained 2lbs.  Do not take this medication if you are trying to lose weight.,F,20,1  months,12/25/2004,Remeron

No perceptual_ memory_ or sexual side effects (which SSRIs and benzos are noted for) and_ as I read and hope_ it should be easier to discontinue.  If you're a chronic worrier_ underweight_ and are not sleeping (or sleeping_ but not deep enough due to stress_ as was my case) this drug should work for you.

737, 1, panic_ anxiety,Always hungry - weight gain a big problem. Slept very deeply - maybe too deeply. Extreme withdrawal symptoms including intense shock-like pains down my neck_ through my sinuses and in my hands. Hands became very stiff and fingers won't always bend or unbend.,Could not stop eating - I was always hungry. Although it didn't make me fall asleep any quicker_ I certainly slept more deeply. In fact_ the house could have burned down around me and I wouldn't have awakened. I never heard the alarm clock in the morning. The worst thing about Remeron has been trying to get off it.Following my doctor's instructions I stayed on 45mg 1 week_ then 30mg 1 week_ 15mg the next and finally I stopped. That night when I went to bed I saw all these really vivid colors swirling around my head. When I finally fell asleep I had extremely vivid nightmares and woke up screaming at some monster. When I got out of bed_ I had intense shooting pains through my sinuses and down my neck_ almost like electric shocks. I felt like my nerve endings had been stripped bare. My hands also had these intense pains and felt like they were creaking. I could barely bend my fingers and one of them got stuck bent. I called my doctor and she told me to take some Remeron that night_ but I took it right away because I felt so bad. Within an hour most of the symptoms subsided_ but my hands are still stiff and go numb occasionally. It is now 2 weeks later and I am trying to decrease the Remeron more gradually. I'm down to 7 1/2 mg and sure hope I can get this stuff out of my system. I sure hope my hands return to normal too.,F,53,75  days,12/1/2004,Remeron

741, 3, Slight Depression_ anxiety,My doctor told me about the increased appetite but I wasnt' expecting the need to eat anything that wasnt nailed down. I did gain weight and it was okay because I had lost too much weight because of not eating prior. I was seriously drowsy and was pretty much in a fog like others have described. I actually felt guilty for wanting to stop taking it because I felt like I was being stubborn to getting help but I see that I'm not alone. I also tried others but they made me more sick or so out of it that I couldn't function. With the remeron_ I could at least function but I was really very drowsy and I did experience crazy dreams. Once again_ I thought this was all me. I appreciate finding this site.,I will say it helps me to stay kinda out of it enough so that I wont feel any anxiety but I did find myself more sad and the eating all the time was surreal.

Can't complete simple tasks at work i used to to able to do in my sleep_ without losing my train of thought/concentration.,Since taking the remeron I now feel like I am having even more severe pms symptoms all the time_ like I am mental_ and fat too-an added bonus i guess.  I think this is what a nervous breakdown feels like maybe??I've been on this for about 3wks-the only reason I've stayed on it is because I also just came off Effexor and i thought some of these side effects were maybe from withdrawal.  After reading these postimgs I'm not so sure. I think overall it's made everything worse_ but I have gotten some better sleep(except for few weird dreams).  NOT taking any remeron tonite and going back to the Dr tomorrow.

746, 3, Insomnia/Depression,WEIGHT GAIN!  I've been ultra petite all my life & I packed on 10-12 lbs in 2 mos.  That's a lot when you are barely able to maintain 105 lbs. to begin with.  Until I read these other reports I couldn't figure out why I just couldn't stop eating.  It's like I'm hungry 24/7 & that is just not me.I have also been in quite a fog_ finding it takes me until about 11am or 12 Noon to get started on my (self employed) work. But even then I was always feeling like a zombie & had to nap - a first - about 5pm.  Not good for business!  I have been taking 15 mg a day.,Apart from the weight gain & the lethargy_ I have to say_ after trying every sleeping pill in existence_ that I have never slept so soundly & regularly as I have since I started on Remeron.  However_ if I turn into a blimp I'm going to be more depressed & I can't do my work being so zoned all the time.  I think now I know why I've been experiencing all this.  I'm also about to start withdrawing off a sedative/hypnotic & someone here said it really helped her. (Any more info on that?) If that's the case_ maybe I should stick it out a little longer...or until I weigh 150 lbs!  Yikes!  My scrip ran out & I've had 2 nights without & still slept like a log!  But I think I'll pick up the scrip tomorrow_ cut it to 7.5 for about a wk & then get the heck off this stuff.  It's too scary_ especially with so little known about its long term effects.,F,43,3  months,10/23/2004,Remeron

I have had three children and I weigh more now than I did nine months pregnant. I am on 45 mgs (I have a high metablison with medicine) haven't been on that long but as one person stated on this website I do feel also like a grazing cow.  Excessive hunger after taking the medicine at night and crave doughnuts.  Tried to take myself of the medicine but I can't sleep without it.  There has to be an alternate medication with out the weight gain.  It's makes me depressed to gain alot of weight in such a little time.

755, 5, depression and weakness,increased appetite_ back and hip pain_ increased weakness_ some constipation,Was a very active person_ long work hours_ yoga.... due to a surgical mistake_ I now suffer chronic pain and lethargy with a weight loss of over 60 lbs. I tried Celexa_ Paxil_ Prozac_ all of which did not agree with me causing nausea and not helping the depression. I took Remeron for about 2 weeks. Did wonders for my depression and helped me to eat more (am underweight). I stopped taking it_ because of the back pain and lethargy but went thru bouts of nausea WITHOUT it. I have now returned to only 1/4 pill Remeron at night and the back pain is back_ but I sleep sounder and my mood is elevated and the nausea has disappeared. My doctor and I are considering adding a low dose of Wellbutrin to combat the fatigue and back pain caused by the Remeron. I also need more pain meds on Remeron_ but hate to return to the black depression caused by arthritis and personal situations. I can function more calmly and rationally on Remeron but need something that doesn't deplete my already-low energy.If anyone has had this similar problem with Remeron_ I'd like to hear from you...... swap notes_ so to speak.,F,57,4  weeks,9/24/2004Email,Remeron

I'm not sure how healthy this is.,M,34,2  years,12/21/2003,Remeron

808, 3, depression,WEIGHT GAIN!!!  I gained 10 pounds in the three weeks I've been on Remeron.  I am always hungary and never feel full even after a HUGE meal.  In the beginning I had very abnormal dreams and was very tired.  It wears off after about a week.  Libido was normal.  With all the drugs on the market for depression_ there has to be one that does not cause weight gain.,,F,30,18  days,10/12/2003,Remeron

812, 2, depression_ insomnia,No side effects_ even the one I wanted. It didn't help my sleeping problems although most people find it a good sleeping pill. I guess I'm somehow different??,Didn't help much. I guess I try eating it little more time_ but propably it will never work.

At first I had increased thirst and slight headache_ but they went away quickly.,It helped my anxiety a great deal_ but I couldn't handle the constant hunger and never-ending weight gain.

817, 5, insomnia,I have a chronic weight problem_ and frankly_ if I had read the comments from others concerning their problems with weight gain with this drug before I tried it_ I would have run from it as fast as I could. I sure don't need to gain any more weight! I had been using the drug for awhile before I found this website. Happily_ I have experienced no such negative side effects_ nor any others that I can think of.,I was at my wits end trying to get to sleep at night.  My doctor recommended Remeron 30 mg. He said that even though it is apparently primarily used as an antidepressant_ it has been effective in treating insomnia also.  From the first time I tried it_ it has been a miracle for me.  I am able to handle stress a lot better too. I guess everyone's experience may be different_ but this drug has proved to be a perfect solution to a longterm problem for me.,F,60,5  months,4/21/2003Email,Remeron
