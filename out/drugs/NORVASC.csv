0, 4, High blood pressure,I don't appear to have had strongly negative side effects after taking this drug. In fact _ this is the third bp medication I've tried as I couldn't tolerate the others at all because they caused such a bad cough that I couldn't sleep at night. However_ it's possible that I'm a little more prone to anxiety than previously_ since taking this drug. Also_ my sleeping isn't great _ but who knows whether this would really be any better off the medication? There's no major swelling of ankles although marks form from wearing socks. These quickly disappear.,My blood pressure has come right down so I guess this drug has achieved its aim. However_ I do wonder about long term effects,F,64,1  years5mg 1X D,8/3/2016,Norvasc
1, 5, Hypertension,Occasional ache in the left ankle but it does'nt affect my mobility at all. I've read reviews from others on this site saying this medicine is banned in the Netherlands. This is not true. I live in the Netherlands and i take this drug at present. I took it since  2010 for 3 years. Stopped for a year due to hair loss. I tried Enalapril which did nothing for me. Stopped a year and started taking Valsartan for about 3 months. Had to stop that too because of high liver counts. I am now back to Amlodipine and my blood pressure is now stable.,It may not work for everyone but one must always try these medicines first. It's the only way one can find out what the effects are. The effects of drugs are personal. I forgot to state that i took Hydrochorthiazide in 2006 for a few years and had terrible tinnitus_ was worse especially at night. I also experienced painful ankles that i had to get an xray_ Of course nothing was found. Could'nt figure out what the reason was till i coincidentally realised that this pill was not good for me. So i will reiterate that this drug is not poison for everyone.,F,57,6  months5mg 1X D,7/11/2016,Norvasc

I have also been dizzy_ almost feels like Vertigo type dizzy. I also feel dazed and confused and have been having chest pain and heat palpitations. I saw my gp who prescribed this yesterday because of the symptoms my bp was much higher then it normally is. She wants me to up my dose from 2.5mg to 5mg. She doesn't believe it's side effects she thinks it's my bp making me feel like this. I took her advice and I took 5mg this morning but I am going to go down to 2.5mg tomorrow and then stop. I have my 1st appointment with a cardiologist on Monday so hoping they will help. This drug is awful.

I ended up in the ER twice with what was diagnosed as panic attacks after taking the generic of this drug amlodipine besylate for 4 weeks. My blood pressure was great so I never thought the dug was causing the symptoms. But I began to keep a journal. Since my BP was very low and I also felt a bit dizzy I started decreasing the dose to 3/4 of a pill and then 1/2. Then a week ago I forgot to take it and remembered by 3pm. Within 40 minutes I had tightness in my chest and 7 hours later shooting chest pain.  No other symptoms. I started writing notes in my journal and realized that the shooting chest pains always occurred 7 hours after taking this drug. That's when I decided I had enough and stopped taking it. It's been a week and the symptoms have subsided although not totally gone.  Still a bit of tightness in the top of my chest now and again but I understand this drug has a long half life and takes a while to be completely gone. I have started yoga and walking to deal with my stress due to the fact that all of my tests were better than normal.  I have also been eating more plant based foods and have made an appointment with a homeopathic doctor.

50, 1, High Blood Pressure,Headaches_ double vision_ joint stiffness_ muscles aches_ weak legs and edema in my head.,I was taking a generic for Norvasc_ Amlodipine. I took it for 7-8 months without noticing any side effects.  Problems started with pain and stiffness in my neck muscles.  A few months later I started having headaches_ turned into serious migraines.  I then started having blurred vision which eventually turned into double vision.  It was so horrible I couldn't drive_ had to bother people to come and pick me up and take me to see doctors who were totally stumped by my condition. After 4 months of awful headaches and vision issues and feeling exhausted all the time_ It's as if this thing started moving down into my body.  My legs became weak_ all the muscles ached and my hips and knees became stiff. All the doctors had no idea what was wrong with me.  After about 5 months of this nightmare_ I decided to look up my medication. I was horrified but relieved to find out the reason for my condition.  It was comforting to find all of the people on this blog posting their comments about the drug.  It seems that prescription drugs are the last thing doctors think of when considering side effects.  I stopped Amlodipine 18 days ago and it's still not completely out of my system. I didn't notice much change the first week.  After that_ a very gradual change_ but each day gets a little bit better.  The not knowing thing for so many months was scary as hell!

I'm on 3 different BP meds and Norvasc was the last one added. My Dr started me out on 5mg and after a while I started to notice that the bottoms of my feet would get really hot and uncomfortable. I Dident relate it to the Norvasc. My dosage was increased to 10mg about 3 months ago. BP is better but the side effects that I now know are from this medication are horrible!! I would just cry over the pain in my feet and all the swelling!! Not to mention my gums! I do t want to even smile anymore. I'm going in for a deep cleaning under my gums starting next week.

For anyone out there who does battle either of these (or other) mental illnesses_ I implore you to have a long talk with you doctor about whether this is the right drug for you_ then have an even longer talk with your pharmacist who is more knowledgeable about these drugs and their side effects. In addition to those side effects I've also had tremendous back pain (something I hadn't had prior)_ my face and legs are swelling_ my skin feels like it's crawing_ and I feel feverish.

83, 1, hypertension,Significant weight gain_ severe constipation_ swelling of legs_ feet_ and ankles_ compartment syndrome in both lower legs_ blood in stools_ labored breathing_ and extreme fatigue,I'm  a bodybuilder and yogini who is very careful about what I put into my body_ but despite being at a very low body weight with a very low fat to lean ratio_ I still had hypertension.  I opted for treatment with this drug when HCTZ began elevating my A1C .. though my blood sugar level was still low.  When I began treatment_ I was at an optimal weight and very active.  Shortly after taking it_ I began experiencing weight gain_ constipation_ shortness of breath_ and swelling of my lower extremities.  I asked for a scrpt for spiranolactone_ which helped with the swelling and trusted that the other symptoms would level off.  They did not.  After two years of being on therapy_ I developed compartment syndrome in both lower legs.  That combined with the weight gain lead to a torn left meniscus that sidelined me for months and lead to more weight gain.  After getting off of the drug_ I immediately noticed that my hair_ eyebrows_ and eyelashes were in better shape and thickening_ and my libido was better_ too. I also lost about 10 lb.  It took a full year_ after stopping the drug_ for my digestive system to return to normal and I'm still struggling with the rest of the weight gain_ which is unfamiliar territory for me.  So much for the flawed opunion that weight gain on this drug depends on your normal metabolism.  I'very known of obese people who did not gain an ounce of weight on it.

I think the constipation was most likely mild because I routinely take a fiber supplement because I have diverticulosis_ and I gradually increased the supplement. By the time I connected the symptoms to the amlodipine_ I had increased the fiber supplement to almost four times as much as I was taking before. After being off the drug for two weeks_ I continue to have to take the increased dose of fiber and have not lost any of the weight_ despite the fact that I am eating less. I spoke to a pharmacist_ who said to give it another week and to drink a lot of water_  She said the drug dehydrates the intestinal tract and causes fluid retention.

Norvasc works at lowering my BP but at an unfortunate cost. I get up in the a.m no appetite_ take meds. 2 hrs later I'm ready for a nap and with 2 lil ones it's unlikely. I feel like a zombie or high_ I can't concentrate and this is just 2 weeks of taking it. I'm constipated_ and having chest pain neither of which were an issue before I began this medication. I also noticed that if I get up to use the restroom at night I have trouble falling back asleep which is why I'm adding my ""2 cents"" to this thread at 1:54/a. I'll definately be letting my dr know but I'm trying to be a ""good lil patient"" and wait an entire month before asking NO_ demanding something else. I went from living a normal life_ not knowing I had hbp to having all kinds of symptoms trying to control it. I've read poor reviews of this medication and very few good ones_ as for the good reviews_ each person claims to be otherwise healthy so I guess the rest of us are overweight_ obese_ and have bad habits.

106, 4, Pulminary hypertension,I take the generic brand of norvasc along with adcirca and xarelto . I've noticed that the drug does work. My blood pressure was near perfect and I can actually climb stairs again without my heart beating so fast that I have to lie down because otherwise I would faint. I have been having fainting spells prior to takin my calcium channel blockers and now I do not so its a huge relief. Yet the side effects are unbearable! I feel like I am always chasing sleep. I am a awake a few hours than sleep a few hours awake for a few and then sleep for a few. I have no days and long nights its awful. I have had a persistent headache for over two weeks that is in the areas of my head as if I wear wearing a thick headband. So pretty much all over! I have extreme lower back pain after a month of taking (norvasc). I have lack of motivation to do anything I stay in bed all damn day. My joints hurt. And my gums hurt and bleed. I even got a canker sore on my lip. Ugh! And I have barely an appitite. And if you now me you know all I used to do was eat all day. I also have runny eyes n red tired looking eyes. Not a good look. I just want a normal life and for people to understand I'm actually going through something and to stop judging me n thinking that I don't care. This medicine is probably causing me depression. Also I'm always in a fog and have almost tunnel vision. I feel more awake when I'm dreaming then I do when I'm actually up!,,F,29,1  months10 mg,8/2/2014Email,Norvasc

If they say 9% get headaches you can be sure it's 50%. By the way.  Do you think your gp reports back to the pharma companies what his patients are telling him? Also. Consider how many people are suffering that don't post or say anything.  This is my fist post ever.  I can't believe how sick this drug made me. I thought it was something else. Read read read.

Last night I was light headed and would feel like my eyes were about to black out and I'd faint_ my chest started feeling uncomfortable_ my arm was tingling and started feeling numb_ I panicked and thought I was about to die then after what seemed eternity it went away.

Went back to the doc he said i had anxiety gave me prozac.  Everytime my heart would flutter it would send me panicking.  I actually felt worse so I went back and asked to lower my norvasc dose.  It was a huge difference.  In four days i felt so much better it was crazy.  Yeah this med lowered my bp to where it should but its not worth the side effects.

Been off it for two days and I am feeling very unbalanced still. I so hope this stops bc I cannot stand how I feel. I wouldn't touch this med for all the money in the world_ but I know everyone is different in their reactions. Bystolic 10mg is what I take for my high BP and that works perfectly for me. My dr did warn me of depression in norvasc and started me on a low dose and had me call in 5 days to see if I could tolerate it_ so he KNOWS.

I just had a general ""ill feeling"". I took myself off this med_ once realizing I was experiencing these side effects once starting the med. I am not a person to just quit taking something_ without giving it ample time to work. But this_  made me feel horrible!

129, 1, Coronary artery spasms,From June-November 2011_ I experienced a half dozen coronary artery spasms_ each of which sent me to the ER. I was put through all standard tests and more: bloodwork _ EKG_ MRI_ lung function_ checked for clots_ GI issues...even checked for TB and eventually had a cardiac cath. Absolutely everything came back normal. After the cardiac cath_ my GP put me on 10 mg/day Lexapro (anti-anxiety) and my cardiologist put me on 5 mg/day generic amlodipine besylate. Anxiety_ racing pulse_ trouble sleeping_ exhaustion_ sudden and precipitous weight gain (15 lbs)_ inability to lose weight_ difficulty exercising_ tingling arms and hands_ painful and blurry vision_ mood swings_ extremely low bp_ rapid pulse_ and just plain misery.  That was 18 months ago.,When I complained to my GP_ he suggested adding another anti-anxiety med. I refused and started researching. Turns out the Imitrex tablets I had for migraine are known to cause coronary artery spasm_ even in people that had no history of cardiac issues. I stopped taking them immediately and just suffer through the once monthly_ three day long headaches. After discussing with both my GP and cardiologist_ I tapered off the Lexapro in April with no significant ill effects. In April_ I also cut the amlodipine to 2.5 mg/day. Three weeks ago_ I halved that and ten days ago stopped completely. Many have asked about what they've experienced coming off amlodipine_ and few have answered. Here's what's happened to me: tension headaches (never had before_ feels like scalp is tight and eyes hurt; helped by 1 Aleve and a cup of coffee every time) for the first few days. Some twitching sensations in neck and upper chest muscles close to sternum.  My bp has never been problematic (100/70 is normal_ on amlodipine it was 95/55 (!!)) and I am back to normal.,F,38,18  months5mg 1X D,7/9/2013Email,Norvasc

Before Norvasc it my heart rate was between 60 and 75 resting. Carvedilol and propranolol do not bring my heart rate down like they used prior to Norvasc so I am thinking it is the Norvasc. Suffered vertigo last time I took this med almost 14 years ago. Memory Loss is significant again. 14 years ago I would leave work and forget where I parked my car_now that I have started this medication again memory failure has started again.

I started doing research about a month ago as I was tired of waking up literally sticking to my sheets EVERY morning. I had testing done on my thyroid_ hormones_ etc to figure out why I was having such extreme night sweats. I went to my PCP and discussed with her that the night sweats were a source of frustration for me and explained how I was concered about the above mentioned side effects that I was experiencing as possible side effects of the Norvasc. She agreed to switch me to Lisinopril 5mg to try and see what happened. About 2 weeks later_ I haven't had but one migraine (compared to almost daily migraines)_ my joints feel better. I am still tired during the day and still have night sweats_ but these are better as well. I had Botox for my migraines and I'm a little ticked that I stuck needles in my face to try and help decrease my migraines_ when in fact it was a medication I was taking that was causing the migraines.

208, 3, High Blood Pressure,After about 2 months at 5 mg. with no discernable side effects_ blood pressure wasn't decreased enough_ so my doctor increased dosage to 10 mg. Shortly thereafter_ I had horrible diarrhea and loose stools for 3 weeks_ then one recent evening after standing for 6 hours_ I developed severe swelling in both legs with a warm_ bright red rash. The next day_ I had a bowel movement with traces of blood (which my doctor said was unrelated_ but I disagree). Doctor decreased dosage back to 5 mg. and the symptoms resolved. I also lost about 4 pounds within a couple of days due to water retention. I've been feeling a bit depressed_ but not sure if that's due to the medication. I'm prone to depression/anxiety. I also have to be very careful when working out (I go to gym 3x a week) because after I stop exercising_ my blood pressure drops significantly_ which causes dizziness.

247, 3, High blood pressure,After about 3 months on Amlodipene (generic for Norvasc)_ started to take gelatin to address back pains.  Next day ankles swelled up.  Stopped gelatin.  Back pain continued.  About two weeks ago_ hip started to hurt - took gelatin again.  It immediately took care of pain in back and somewhat in hip_ but on second day ankles swelled up.  Tried the gelatin at lower dose and at longer intervals.  Ankles still swelled up on 2nd day.  Stopped gelatin. A week ago_ started CoQ10 and now left ankle and foot is swollen continuously.  I figure the problem is the Norvasc - and some interaction with these other products.  I can't blame the Gelatin - as it is a food.  Nor can I blame the CoQ10 - as it is an enzyme.  I give Norvasc a rating of 3_ considering that it did get my BP under control - when I was doing nothing else for myself.,In an effort to lose weight_ I have been walking 2 miles a day for 2 months. BP is fine after walking_ but I have lost no weight.  Since taking CoQ10_ BP is fine (120/70 - 130/80) even first thing in morning before walking.  FYI:  Don't take any CoQ10 - some brands are totally worthless.  Check out Life Extension or do some research.  To lose weight_ check out 7 Principles of Fat Loss by Eric Berg.  It's different; it's a challenge - but to me_ it makes perfect sense.  I've been studying his book this week and next week I start on the program.  In the meantime_ I am weaning myself off from the Norvasc.  I am now taking 5 mg/day.  If after a week my BP stays the same_ then I am off it for good.

261, 3, High Blood pressure,There are three side effects that I have experienced on Norvasc. First_ and the most significant for me has been the much reduced ability to think clearly. It definitely has affected my mind_ my memory_ and my thinking and reasoning response-time. For instance_ trying to respond with answers to the Jeopardy program questions is nearly futile. I feel like a confused kid trying to figure out a mystery that's way beyond me reach. The second side effect is some swelling of the ankles and hands.  This is not very pronounced and I can live with it. At the end of the day the sock ring indentation is less than 1/8th of an inch. The third side effect is itchiness_ mostly in the evenings.  This was worse early on_ and has not been as much of a problem after 5 months_ but it is a noticeable nuisance.  I agree with another poster about taking an exam while on Norvasc.

My doctor said I was having an allergic reaction and should stop immediately. After 1 week my eczema was gone and 2 weeks later the red rash has seemed to stop spreading but hasn't gone away. Based on other research and posts the side-effects take 4 weeks to start appearing and an estimated 6 weeks to go away.

I also experienced tiredness and had trouble concentrating at work or while reading. I had flushing on my face and neck that was noticable and caught people's attention.

Then I skipped 4 days of Norvasc because I had run out of refills over a weekend. When I went back on it_ all of the side effects came back immediately. I asked to change medicines while at the dr.

My doctor insisted I take this pill as my pressure was high when I went to his office (it has been normal whenever the pain was contained as in hospital stays of weeks).  After taking it for a week my legs and arms were in such terrible pain - my ankles swollen and I was in agony.  I ended up taking my codeine and sleeping on and off for about 2 days pretty much in bed unable to even walk from my bedroom to the living room.  I forgot to take my pills and suddenly realized I had been through this before and that's why my former primary doctor didn't prescribe calcium blockers.

I would never_ ever take this medicine again.,Don't take it.

359, 1, hypertension,My feet were really swollen and I had really bad dreams_ but then it took a turn for the worse.  SEVERE pain in left thigh area_ to the point that I could not WALK. I had unbearable pain shooting through my thigh (sitting_ standing_ walking_ even lying down)!  It felt as if the muscle in my thigh had become so weak it could not hold me up_ so when I would stand up my leg would collapse.  I was only on the medication 26 DAYS! It progressively got worse...I started out with a limp_ then dragging my leg_ then literally feeling like I wanted to crawl!  As soon as I realized that this was probably a side affect from the medicine I immediately stopped taking it and saw my new Physician(who had not perscribed this_ and she expressed she never would have because she saw similar side affects in her other patients.)

In April_ my doctor increased my norvasc dosage from 5 to 10.  The druggist also switched me to the generic.  That's when I developed the eczema although it took until 3 weeks ago for me to get a diagnosis.  I've been to an allergist and a dermatologist.  This web site has saved me from thinking I'm going crazy.  It is such a relief to see that there are other people who are having the same problems as me from this medicine.  I have an appointment this Monday and I am telling my internist doctor I do not want to take this drug.  In the meantime_ I'm going back to the 5 dosage until Monday.  I had asked him to switch me before due to the swelling and his response was the swelling wasn't that bad and that the norvasc was doing such a good job controlling my high blood pressure.  I'm not a doctor but does it make any sense that I'm also on a diuretic to reduce my water retention and yet I'm being kept on norvasc which is causing me to have ede,F,70,2  years,9/13/2008Email,Norvasc

I'm very active (riding bike approx 100mi/wk) but I'd lost interest in anything requiring energy or thinking. Symptoms started within several days of my first Amlodipine dose_ but it took me two weeks to put 2+2 together. Within a week after stopping the medication I'm feeling normal again.

419, 1, Hypertension,For so long I thought I was suffering post-menopausal problems when I experienced hot flushes.  The problem was so bad that it interfered with my life to a substantial degree.  I also had swollen ankles and tingling in my lower legs which interfered with my standing for any length of time.  I also had a slight irritating cough.  I was taken off Norvasc and the swelling disappeared as did the tingling sensation and cough.

Then I drank 4 oz. of wine and experienced irregular heartbeats for about 6 hours_ was flushed and generally didn't feel well.  The next day I had chest pains all day. Ended up in the ER. They told me my potassium was low_ gave me pills and sent me home. My BP has lowered_ but I have been waking up at 3AM with chest pains and/or irregular heart beat_ almost daily.,The ER doctor said it was not the Norvasc. I have taken it for three weeks. My Doctor says my chest pains were not from the Norvasc either. I am taking 10mg. In the last 2 weeks I have had 7 days of chest pain.   Last night my ankles iched like crazy.  I also notice that I wake up in the night with both arms asleep. The Doctor says to keep taking it until I see him on Tuesday.

My BP is down within normal ranges_ but it doesn't seem to control it when I'm at work under stress.,I brought the heart beat issues to my Dr.'s attention.  He ordered an EKG.  That came back with reservations_ so then I underwent an Echo stress test which came back okay.  He said that most people are not aware of their own heart beat. I personally don't understand this comment since I try to pay attention to my body.  I work out most weeks 4 times per week at least 30 minute each time.

497, 2, to control BP,After years on Norvasc_ BP started to increase.  Dr changed med to Dynacirc.  On Dynacirc for 2 weeks without any improvement_ but then developed sever sholder and hip joint_ and lower back muscle_ pain.  Could not sleep without pain.  Stopped Dynacirc and back to Norvasc.  BP was high and eratic for a few days_ but the joint and muscle pain seemed to go away within 6-8 hours of ceasing Dynacirc.  However now 1 week later with my Norvasc_ I now have the return of the joint and muscle pain.  Strange that I never had this pain with Norvasc.  Seems as though the Dynacirc sensitized my body to whatever the chemical is in these calcium channel blockers_ and now even the old Norvasc is causing the pains.  Another symptom that I have with Norvasc is periphereal obrbital edema - a horizontal sack of fluid about 1/4 inch thick and 1 inch long has developed under my left eye socket.  Asked the Dr many times about this_ but he never told me what it was.  Never had this until I had started on Norv,On Norvasc for years.  Dr prescribed Dynacirc in October 2006_ and took about a month before pain began.  Stopped Dynacirc about 1 1/2 weeks ago_ and returned to Norvasc.  Joint and muscle pain ceaased temporarily_ but have returned.  Stopped taking all meds about three days ago.  BP is eratic and higher than I'd like it to be_ but I don't want the pain.  Hopefully the Dr can prescribe something that will work for me without this painful side effect.,M,65, ,12/8/2006,Norvasc

I had been taking 10mgs Norvasc for 3 months when I started getting this reddish_ pin point rash from mid calf down to the tops of both feet. The rash will turn to a brownish color like freckles in a couple of days. Found out from a dermatologist that this rash is called_ Schamburgs purpura and could be a side effect of the drug. This drug can thin your blood and also can cause gum disease. I have to brush my teeth gently or end up with bleeding gums. Also_ I am tired everyday and feel unmotivated making myself do the housework etc.,I also get swelling of my ankles and feet if I take the 10 mgs so I have cut the dosage to 5 mgs. Lately_ I've been having palpitations which scare me and make my anxiety disorder worse. I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone and wonder how the drug company can market such a drug. BEWARE!

530, 2, Borderline High Blood Pressure,I have only been taking Norvasc 5mg. for 4 days and I'm not taking another pill. I have been having headaches_ at times_ severe abdominal pain_ some heartburn and dizziness. All symptoms are mild to moderate_ but enough to make me stop.,After reading other responses on this board_ I'm going to discontinue Norvasc. I have Borderline HPB and don't feel the sides are worth it; especially at 34 years old. It did lower my systolic BP,M,34,4  days,5/15/2006,Norvasc

Reduced to 5mg and am now trying 2.5mg.  It really has not reduced my bp (about 150/100).

532, 3, high blood pressure,no side effects that were noticeable at first but 3 months ago after taking norvasc 5 mg for over a year_ i began feeling tired and weak in the legs.  doctor said i was fine.  This continued on and off for several weeks and 3 more visits to the doctor.  He always said there was nothing wrong.  He gave me a b-12 shot for my tiredness.  i even asked him if the norvasc was causing this problem in my legs but he said only the 10mg does that and i was only take 5mg.  I was also getting hot hands and hot flashes at night that would keep me awake.  He said that i had depression and gave me paxil to take.  I took that for 10 days but realized that was not the answer.  He even told me to go see a psychologist.  then i noticed my ankles were slightly swollen and had red marks on the lower legs.  That's when I realized it was norvasc causing the problem.  When I told the doctor he still did not believe it but told me it was ok to stop taking it for awhile.  Now off it for 8 days and the symptons,norvasc did lower my blood pressure but now it's causing too many problems.  Maybe this drug is only good for a certain period of time.  Perhaps i don't need any more hbp medication also.,M,46,18  months,5/12/2006,Norvasc

My dentist told me my gum condition went from bad to the worest. I didn't have energy_ gained 20lb_ I lost concentration and became very slow to think.

I am going to tell the doc tomorrow to try something else.Norasc is a killer drug.,It might help some people for me it was a nightmare.

My Dr. had started me on 10 mg. intially_ I think that was one of the problems...dosage way to high. I've tried cutting the pills in fours and am taking 2.5 with no side effects and no angina.  I will try to increase it to 5mg.

Had 1st encounter with Cardio Stent Doc. Stent was put in due to blockage-angina. Ins Co changed policy on paying for Verapimil_ so asked Cardio Stent Doc. to pick an equivalent off Ins Co list. He picked 5 mg Norvasc. Was on 5 mg Norvasc for 3 yrs_ no real problems except low physical energy. May 10_2005-had the radioacive dye test with treadmil for first time to see if heart muscle is getting good blood flow. New Cardio Doc. showed me pics and said 3 yrs ago when experiencing angina during bike rides that I apparently had a heart attack. Blood flow appears diminished now to one area of heart muscle. Consequently_ CardioDoc takes me off of 10 mg Norvasc_ and puts me on Lopressor 25 mg two times a day. Taking 25 mg with food at 6 am and 25 mg with food at 9pm with my Lipitor 10 mg. CardioDoc did not explain twice a day regimen. Pharmacist said BP meds should be given according to body's natural clock. She said heart attacks mostly occur between midnight and 6 am. Lopressor generic is Metoprolol which is less expensive. Beta blocker slows heart beat and reduces load which is supposed to lower BP. My Morning BP checked at 150/100 which seems high. Writing down BP checks and checking blood sugar levels. Doing walks to support exercise regimen. Beta blocker is a new thing for me_ side effects are always on my mind. Recently went in for upper resp inf_ saw 2 GP docs and one asthma doc_ BP was 150/95 at all three checks...not one word about these numbers being abnormally high. I asked CardioDoc_ he increased Norvasc from 5mg to 10mg. Was on the higher dose for 1 week_ then following radioactive stress treadmil_ CardioDoc took me off Norvasc and put me on Beta Blocker 2 times a day. BP still higher than I would like. Going for a walk and will recheck. You must ask as many questions as doctors will take to cover all bases. You are your own best advocate 24/7. A 15 min or less office call every year will not give adequate coverage of a medical condition that could kill you. Change doctors_ most are over loaded_ and can only care so much for their many patients. Have one of your kids go to med school_ or marry a doctor. Have one of your kids go to law school_ or marry an attorney. Also need an engineer and a computer scientist in the family.

Was on the higher dose for 1 week_ then following radioactive stress treadmil_ CardioDoc took me off Norvasc and put me on Beta Blocker 2 times a day. BP still higher than I would like. Going for a walk and will recheck. You must ask as many questions as doctors will take to cover all bases. You are your own best advocate 24/7. A 15 min or less office call every year will not give adequate coverage of a medical condition that could kill you. Change doctors_ most are over loaded_ and can only care so much for their many patients. Have one of your kids go to med school_ or marry a doctor. Have one of your kids go to law school_ or marry an attorney. Also need an engineer and a computer scientist in the family. Okay_ also need a good stock broker and real estate agent in the family_ now your covered....good luck with circadian clock and BP monitoring. Get a home BP meter...check it often...Wilford Brimley,M,56,3  days,5/22/2005Email,Norvasc

581, 1, High BP at 140/90 and 185 lbs,Blood pressure initially came down about 15 points but after a few days I felt like I was not breathing deeply at night like a person should_ although I didn't feel short of breath.  I can feel my pulse in my ears.  Had to open the window.  Blood pressure went up during the night_ went to doctor instead of work_ doctor raised dosage to 10 mg thining I was not on enough medicine.,After five more days on the higher dosage_ BP dropped to 122/85.  Ended up in ER with chest pains_ all tests showed no problem_ including cardio stress test.  Why is it since taking this medicine I have nearly been in the ER twice?  ER doctor said Norvasc would not do this but I think he's wrong.  Swollen red legs yesterday_ today I was taken off Norvasc and put on a new medicine.  Happy because I think Norvasc lowered my BP too much at night when no one measured it_ I measured it on arousal today and it was 98/65 with pulse of 57!  Too low!  Lack of oxygen will cause angina.
