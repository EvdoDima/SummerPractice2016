0, 4, High blood pressure,I don't appear to have had strongly negative side effects after taking this drug. In fact _ this is the third bp medication I've tried as I couldn't tolerate the others at all because they caused such a bad cough that I couldn't sleep at night. However_ it's possible that I'm a little more prone to anxiety than previously_ since taking this drug. Also_ my sleeping isn't great _ but who knows whether this would really be any better off the medication? There's no major swelling of ankles although marks form from wearing socks. These quickly disappear.,My blood pressure has come right down so I guess this drug has achieved its aim. However_ I do wonder about long term effects,F,64,1  years5mg 1X D,8/3/2016,Norvasc
1, 5, Hypertension,Occasional ache in the left ankle but it does'nt affect my mobility at all. I've read reviews from others on this site saying this medicine is banned in the Netherlands. This is not true. I live in the Netherlands and i take this drug at present. I took it since  2010 for 3 years. Stopped for a year due to hair loss. I tried Enalapril which did nothing for me. Stopped a year and started taking Valsartan for about 3 months. Had to stop that too because of high liver counts. I am now back to Amlodipine and my blood pressure is now stable.,It may not work for everyone but one must always try these medicines first. It's the only way one can find out what the effects are. The effects of drugs are personal. I forgot to state that i took Hydrochorthiazide in 2006 for a few years and had terrible tinnitus_ was worse especially at night. I also experienced painful ankles that i had to get an xray_ Of course nothing was found. Could'nt figure out what the reason was till i coincidentally realised that this pill was not good for me. So i will reiterate that this drug is not poison for everyone.,F,57,6  months5mg 1X D,7/11/2016,Norvasc

I have also been dizzy_ almost feels like Vertigo type dizzy. I also feel dazed and confused and have been having chest pain and heat palpitations. I saw my gp who prescribed this yesterday because of the symptoms my bp was much higher then it normally is. She wants me to up my dose from 2.5mg to 5mg. She doesn't believe it's side effects she thinks it's my bp making me feel like this. I took her advice and I took 5mg this morning but I am going to go down to 2.5mg tomorrow and then stop. I have my 1st appointment with a cardiologist on Monday so hoping they will help. This drug is awful.

I ended up in the ER twice with what was diagnosed as panic attacks after taking the generic of this drug amlodipine besylate for 4 weeks. My blood pressure was great so I never thought the dug was causing the symptoms. But I began to keep a journal. Since my BP was very low and I also felt a bit dizzy I started decreasing the dose to 3/4 of a pill and then 1/2. Then a week ago I forgot to take it and remembered by 3pm. Within 40 minutes I had tightness in my chest and 7 hours later shooting chest pain.  No other symptoms. I started writing notes in my journal and realized that the shooting chest pains always occurred 7 hours after taking this drug. That's when I decided I had enough and stopped taking it. It's been a week and the symptoms have subsided although not totally gone.  Still a bit of tightness in the top of my chest now and again but I understand this drug has a long half life and takes a while to be completely gone. I have started yoga and walking to deal with my stress due to the fact that all of my tests were better than normal.  I have also been eating more plant based foods and have made an appointment with a homeopathic doctor.

50, 1, High Blood Pressure,Headaches_ double vision_ joint stiffness_ muscles aches_ weak legs and edema in my head.,I was taking a generic for Norvasc_ Amlodipine. I took it for 7-8 months without noticing any side effects.  Problems started with pain and stiffness in my neck muscles.  A few months later I started having headaches_ turned into serious migraines.  I then started having blurred vision which eventually turned into double vision.  It was so horrible I couldn't drive_ had to bother people to come and pick me up and take me to see doctors who were totally stumped by my condition. After 4 months of awful headaches and vision issues and feeling exhausted all the time_ It's as if this thing started moving down into my body.  My legs became weak_ all the muscles ached and my hips and knees became stiff. All the doctors had no idea what was wrong with me.  After about 5 months of this nightmare_ I decided to look up my medication. I was horrified but relieved to find out the reason for my condition.  It was comforting to find all of the people on this blog posting their comments about the drug.  It seems that prescription drugs are the last thing doctors think of when considering side effects.  I stopped Amlodipine 18 days ago and it's still not completely out of my system. I didn't notice much change the first week.  After that_ a very gradual change_ but each day gets a little bit better.  The not knowing thing for so many months was scary as hell!  So excited to get my life back!,F,62,18  days10 MG 1X D,10/11/2015,Norvasc

Dry mouth and cry a lot.,I'm so thankful to find this sight! I really thought I was going crazy or had some life threatening things going on. I'm on 3 different BP meds and Norvasc was the last one added. My Dr started me out on 5mg and after a while I started to notice that the bottoms of my feet would get really hot and uncomfortable. I Dident relate it to the Norvasc. My dosage was increased to 10mg about 3 months ago. BP is better but the side effects that I now know are from this medication are horrible!! I would just cry over the pain in my feet and all the swelling!! Not to mention my gums! I do t want to even smile anymore. I'm going in for a deep cleaning under my gums starting next week. It's 4 treatments..JOY! I have got to get off this ASAP! I also made an appointment with a Natualpathic Dr_ can't warier to hear what he has to say.

56, 1, High BP,Hives_ severe itching on inside of forearm. Swelling of lymph nodes under arms and swelling of breasts. Pain in one breast.,After countless doctor visits_ mammogram_ blood tests_ no one knew what was wrong with me. I told everyone of them what medicine I was taking. Just happened to have a follow up appt with my Cardiologist and he said oh that's a reaction to Norvasc. Rash and breast swelling stopped as soon as I quit taking. Unfortunately I have now had three more allergic reactions to three other BP meds. Never allergic to anything in my life. Now the list is growing with no known answers. Did Norvasc do this to me? I don't know. Now allergic to Lisinipril_toprol xl_ hydralazine. I have taken ALEVE for years from time to time. Took two yesterday and felt like I was going to pass out. Made me lightheaded. I have just gone thru every heart test possible and all results are normal. I need answers as to why I am now allergic to so many drugs.

This medicine hasn't significantly reduced my BP.  148/95.  I wish my doctor would order an angiogram for my adrenal arteries.  Perhaps a blocked or partially bloc ked artery is causing my HBP. A stent would cure this problem.,F,55,1  months5mg per da,8/5/2015Email,Norvasc
