0, 1, endometriosis/lupron add back,leg cramps/extreme food cravings/intense highs and lows with mood,Im a 25 year old who has been struggling with painful periods that leave me bedridden for up to 10 days.  I had an endo laparoscopy where they removed all of the endometriosis.  Following surgery I was recommended to get the Lupron shot which i allowed my gyno to do and give me this add back of aygestin.  This drug led me to think I was having a mental breakdown.  Which it did.  Gave me leg cramps and body aches that I wasted to much money seeing doctors trying to figure out if I have an autoimmune disease.  Get the ok from doctor and dump down a toilet!!!!!,F,25,2  months 1X D,8/16/2016,Aygestin
1, 3, Postpone period for Wedding,Moon face_ slight weight gain_ Coming off of it bad cramps before period and feeling of fullness and nausea.,So this medication served its purpose for me. I took 5mg three time daily for about 2 1/2 weeks to postpone my period for my wedding. I took it In combination with birth control so I know the risks I put my body through on so much hormones . I am becoming a licensed pharmacist and I know going cold turkey off a medication is not always the best thing to do_ so I tried tapering it off to avoid bleeding. It didn't work. It took about 2 days of being completely off of it to bleed. I felt extremely bad the entire day. Terrible cramps. My periods are usually very easy for me. This hasn't been. I was feeling nauseas all day. Second day wasn't as bad. I'm just trying to figure out when the bleeding will stop.,F,24,2  weeks15mg,7/25/2016,Aygestin
2, 4, Nonstop bleeding due to polyp,Night sweats; significant acne on my thighs_ back_ and arms; vaginal dryness for the first time in my life; weight gain.,"This was my first exposure to a progestin (and the first birth control pill to ever work for me_ emotionally). Stopped the bleeding (and menses) until my upcoming procedure to remove the uterine polyp. Instantly lifted my mood and balanced my emotions. To my delight_ my brain became ""sharper""_ though I think I was just progesterone deficient. I needed the weight gain_ so in this I was very happy. I'm unhappy with all the unsightly acne on my thighs - so many small red dots_ as if I was bitten by fire ants. The night sweats are occasional_ but unsettling. What I'm most worried about is the vaginal dryness. :/",F,36,4  months5 MG 1X D,7/21/2016Email,Aygestin
3, 4, Heavy uncontrolled periods,Weight gain & facial acne.,This medication has made a huge difference for me. It stopped my heavy periods _ but I do not know if I am even close to being menopausal_ which was the whole point of taking this medication to carry me thru. My blood did not indicate anything as far as hormones levels_ so we cannot tell. I had three expert opinions prior to being put on this drug. My problem is my current OBGYN is very nasty to me_ and she wants to take me off of it. I am so nervous every time I see this woman that I think I am going to have to switch  doctors. I am also thinking about going back to one of the original specialist to see if it is ok to stay on for a few more years_ if not how do I wean off. I was just wondering if anyone who has been on this medication for a while had expirienced any side effects getting off of it. I am worried about getting that heavy cycle again_ along with physical changes it could pose to me such as depression_ hair and skin problems_ possibly fueling estrogen. If anyone has been on this drug long term and could shed some light on how they got off of it and what effects it had on them_ can you please post on this board. I would greatly appreciate any information on your expirience since the internet does not have very much information on this drug and long term use. Thank you so much.,F,51,4  years10 1X D,7/11/2016,Aygestin
4, 3, Heavy bleeding,weight gain_ I work out 7 days at a cross training gym and go sometimes 2x a day and gained 8 lbs after eating a healthy diet,it did cure The heavy bleeding in fact it made my periods disappear,F,49,6  months5,6/27/2016,Aygestin
5, 1, Heavy bleeding_ endometriosis,First 10 days was fine_ BUT started having really bad excursiating pain_CRAMPS and feels like I have to vomit all the time! I'm done with this medication feels awful from AM til PM!,,F,44,6  days5MG,6/6/2016,Aygestin
6, 1, Endometriosis suppression,My life on this medication was a living hell. I gained 30 lbs_ but I hardly ate. It did NOT help ease the cramping and daily pain in my pelvis and low back in any way. In fact_ I believe the progestin may have encouraged endometriosis growth.The effects on my mood were horrible. Take the absolute worst PMS you've ever had and multiply it by ten_ then live it every single day. Emotional lability_ loss of libido_ irritability_ anxiety_ and extreme depression. It was hard enough on me_ but even harder on my family and friends. I was in a constant state of hormonal despair. Again_ it was hell_ and as far as I can tell_ the only thing it helped was that it reduced my menstruation. However_ note that in 6 months I still bled off and on (with no predictability) for 27 days. I also saw no reduction in my migraines either.,If you are desperate you can try this med. I did because it really does help some women. I simply was not one of those. The nice thing about this particular med is that it is a daily pill_ so when you decide you've had enough you can just stop. I was very relieved when I made that choice. The side effects diminished within days_ although my cycle still hasn't quite returned to normal. Nor has my metabolism and the depression that it kickstarted.,F,35,6  months5,4/25/2016,Aygestin
7, 4, Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,Moodiness_ weight gain_ crying and anxiety spells,I started aygestin after about 3-4 weeks of heavy bleeding and TERRIBLE clots. Before I went in to see my gynecologist_ I felt like there were no options but to get a hysterectomy. My doctor put me on this persecution at four times a day for three weeks and the heavy bleeding went away and stayed away until I finished my last pill. About 3-5 days later (after stopping the pill) the bleeding came back (with excruciating cramps) not as bad as it was before but still pretty heavy. I want another prescription of this stuff but my doctor wants to try and regulate me using birth control. While on aygestin I was able to have my life back but now all I do is lay around and miss out on life. Being on aygestin is great if it works well for you but coming off is just as depressing as before you start. Good luck to anyone who is thinking about trying this medication for the same reason as me. I do hope that the withdrawal doesn't send you into a funk!,F,20,3  weeks5MG,3/26/2016,Aygestin

11, 5, Abnormal uterine bleeding,My brainfog is gone_ my nasal congestion cleared up and after 10 doses_ my bleeding stopped. Not feeling the normal heavy daily fatigue and BONUS_ losing weight. Compared to others negative reviews_ this is a miracle for me. Also breast cysts have all gone down except for one.,Provera started my period two weeks early(lasted 3 weeks) when in fact it was prescribed to thin the lining of my uterus to avoid excessive bleeding and clotting. FAIL! After 3 months_ I was switched to Aygestin and have not felt this good for 20+ years. Thinned the uterine wall and the side effects are amazing FOR ME. I have had undiagnosed PCOS since age 18 in RT ovary only and have 3 children. 3 days 4x/day_ 3 days 3x/day_ 10 days 2x/day =41 pills,F,48,19  days5mg 4X D,9/30/2015,Aygestin
12, 5, hormone replacement/hysterectomy,Had a hysterectomy with ovary removal in February 2015 (at 46 years and apparently not perimenopausal but feeling that I should be locked in an attic). Afterwards I dropped 25 lbs w/o effort. No menopausal symptoms to speak of. No extreme mood swings_ depression_ anger_ anxiety_ etc. Feel normal for the first time in years.,Each person is different. What works for one will not work for another. My OB/GYN says I'm in the lucky 20% who don't experience extreme menopausal symptoms. Aygestin seems to regulate my hormones just fine since my hysterectomy.,F,47,8  months5mg,8/11/2015,Aygestin
13, 1, delay period,Noticed extreme irritability within 48 hours. For the first time ever_ extreme dryness before_ during and after sex.,Decided to stop taking by day #4 since I know my body well and wasn't willing to risk a longer return to how my body reacts to sex.

15, 4, Continuous bleeding or no periods,Headaches_ minor breakouts,"I was having super long periods (like 2 months long!) or if not_ I was missing periods. I could not handle taking these meds every day as it really affected my mood. But sort of by accident I discovered_ I can take ONE pill a month and four days later I get a normal (a bit lighter) period.

16, 5, endometriosis_ fibroids,At first I experienced hot flashes_  irritability_ joint pain_ swelling_ and mood swing_ decreased sex drive_ and extreme fatigue. The    symptoms started getting better the longer I took the meds.,This medicine has worked wonders for me. I had two surgeries and countless other procedures but aygestin was the only thing that got rid of all my endo pain_ shrunk my fibroids and helped my interstitial cystitis.  This medicine takes time to work and the benefits out weigh the side effects.,F,34,7  years5mg,4/22/2015Email,Aygestin
17, 1, fibroids and heavy bleeding,Bleeding for 3 months_cramping_pelvic pain_cysts in breast_weight gain_shortness of breath and cramping in my feet and headaches.,Would never recommend for anyone to begin taking a synthetic medicine that is supposed to help alleviate heavy bleeding but also facilitates bleeding for those who are trying to have a menstrual cycle. Very confusing!,F,50,3  months5mg,1/20/2015Email,Aygestin
18, 4, Extreme Endo_ and hormone imbalance,So far so good_ my mood is calmer and seems to be at a continuous level_ I don't feel as if I'm all cranky and all over the place at all. I am having some body aches_ my knees seem a tad swollen_ and hurt along with other joint pain. (Could be due to the fact that I'm already susceptible for hypoglycemia and hypokalemia which means being susceptible to lower electrolytes and such especially sugars and potassium) I'll most likely need to interject a vitamin supplement with the direction of the physician.In the meantime I'll make sure to eat more bananas and potatoes_ especially since I've lost 8lbs since Dec. 6th 2014.As long as I can maintain electrolyte levels and not lose too much weight then it should be a good thing. Personally_ I don't want to go past the 140 mark and I was right around 138 @ 5_3' Aside from quitting smoking last year I've never been able to maintain a steady weight.For the past 8 months I leveled out at 138.However; I suspect I'll have to try a little harder to keep my appetite up since I've noticed it has seemed to suppress my appetite_ although it's starting to improve a little this being my second month on Aygestin.I've noticed a few places on my skin_ a little itching_especially during the first month but the area is very small_ on my calf_ and it actually seems to be getting better.All in all I'd say the pros out weigh the cons_ for me at least_ and for now it seems.I'm also on Lupron once a month.,"By the way_ I NEVER thought this would be my everyday reality_ but I can already tell it's helping.I wish everyone the best_ as I have been through 15 years_ of desperately seeking the ""right fit""And I know how horrible it feels trying to figure it out_ while struggling to find a provider who will actually give a darn.I'm not big on the idea of medications_ but for me all the pain and the severity of my hormone imbalance is what drove my choice.My providers are taking it slow_ at lower levels_ and truly taking the time to listen.I naturally determined that enough was enough and when it's that bad ya can't just sit back and let it continue because it will_ and it will only get worse. You have to at least try and if things don't work out you can always try something else. *I hope this helps a little*Also_ please keep in mind that everyone is different and everyone will react differently so don't let everyone's responses determine your decision.Don't get scared. You know your body and you know what you can or can't handle. Good luck!",F,37,2  months5mg,1/14/2015,Aygestin

21, 4, irregular bleeding,Had to take 2x per day for 20 days_ then stop and restart next month 1x/day for ten days. Am on Day 8. When taking 2x per day - very moody_ breast tenderness but lost weight and cramping went away. Period was heavy but that was supposed to happen_ as too much was built up. This time_ I have gained weight_ about 4 pounds_ in just a week ! Can't wait to finish. Also feel crampier_ but no breast tenderness or moodiness on the lower dose. Completely stopped all spotting_ though_ which has been wonderful. Hoping I won't need to take this any more but doctor prescribed for ten days out of each month for six months. Going for second opinion and may try stopping_ hope this has corrected the problem as I await menopause to kick in.,,F,48,2  months5mg 1X D,11/9/2014,Aygestin

Still feel fatigued and lost interest in going to the gym. The bleeding is gone along with the painful cramps. Don't think I would stay on this longer than 6 weeks because of the headaches.

Even though it stopped the bleeding which is great I am not going to take this anymore due to the side effects but I have noticed the symptoms increase especially the dizziness once the meds are stopped which is strange. My period came right after I stopped taking the meds but tapered off after around 7 days and has not come back YAAAY! But the dizziness and lower back pain are still here. It also makes my fingers swollen and very sore at the joints. Once bleeding starts it takes 3 pills a day to stop it then I can go down to 2 1/2 pills per day to keep it away,,F,46,6  months5mg,2/13/2014Email,Aygestin

I was bleeding so heavy and for so long that I had a blood transfusion. This pill saved my life! I highly recommend you try it.

I would choose those side affects over the MISERY i was living for years. I was always in some sort of pain. Always. I do feel like its time to up the dosage tho so i will discuss at next doc appt.

36, 5, Heavy Bleeding,This medication has been very helpful to me. Basically holding back my periods and preventing me from having a hysterectomy at this time. I just hope to use these to get myself into menopause which I don't think is very far off. I have had the worst heavy periods in the past few years and this stuff just stopped them in their tracks. Although_ I did have one 2 day breakthough very heavy_ but It stopped.,I have had noticed my skin is more acne prone_ so I have switched to acne products and for the most part it is under control. I seem to have a little joint pain_ but I am not sure this is the med doing it. I have to say I am more depressed than usual. I cannot comment on weight since I have been eating out a lot the past few months_ so I don't think the few extra pounds are from the aygestin.

111, 2, to control heavy bleeding,Headache_ light bleeding every day_ extreme fatigue_ high blood pressure_ weakness_ depression_ abdominal pain_ nausea.,I don't like this stuff_ I hardly ever have side effects to medications but this one takes the cake!  I called my surgeon who didn't seem concerned about all the side effects at this time and said to come see him in a month.  I was placed on the meds after having a large fibroid removed and continued heavy peroids.  I am going to ask to be taken off this horrible stuff as soon as possible.,F,37,15  days,9/12/2007,Aygestin
112, 2, Control Endometreosis Pain,After 1.5 years on the pill_ I developed Pulmonry Embolism (Blood Clots in my Lungs!) that nearly killed me. i was getting Lupron injections the last 6 months of this pill.  Terrible combination. I regret taking the pill_ and i strongly recommend that blood clots are way worse than the  benefits of the pill.,"My doctor never discussed risks of the pill til after i was in the hospital diagnosed with blood clots.  she said the Progestin-Only bc pill was lower in risk for causing clots_ but i got them still. the manufacturers state the risks_ but my doc didn't think they applied to me.  i wouldn't have either. i was healthy fit active.  i strongly advise you look at other options. i have heard SO many women's blood clot/from pill stories since i got mine. I don't think my Endo pain was much reduced_ altho i have to say my ""mood"" became more even on the pill.",F,44,1.5  years,7/7/2007Email,Aygestin
113, 3, prlolonged heavy bleeding,headache_ dizzyness_ mood swings_ depression_ insomnia even WITH taking my sleeping pills!,I absolutely HATE this stuff.  I am only taking it to control the bleeding before my hysterectomy in four weeks.  Work has been very stressful_ and this medication is making it at least ten times worse_ and it's really hard on me emotionally and physically.  I forgot ONE pill on ONE day_ and two days later I started bleeding again_ it took 5 full days to stop again_ even though I didn't miss anymore.  If I had to take this forever_ I would rather bleed to death_ because I know I wouldn't be able to keep a job or friends if I kept taking it.  It has changed my personality.,F,46,25  days,6/25/2007,Aygestin
114, 1, heavy abnormal bleeding,Horrid!  The second day I took Aygestin_ within 30 minutes I experienced a 2 hour period of very frightening mental confusion.  That is the best way I can describe it.  To be specific_ it felt like I was sedated_ but trying to 'come out of it'.  I didn't recognize phone numbers or calendar dates and couldn't recall names of individuals.  It went away after about 2 hours_ but it was very_ very_ scary.  My dr. was surprised at the side effect_ but I guess I have a hyper-sensitivity to this particular drug.,,F,51,2  days,5/24/2007,Aygestin
115, 4, heavy abnormal bleeding,Very depressed.....decreased appetite_ high fatigue_ insomnia_ mood swings_ very tearful...I cry almost every day....the holidays have been the pits...breast tenderness....very easily irritated...high rate of irritability.....,Aygestin has helped with the abnormal bleeding...I have been taking it for a while and the dosage had to be increased because bleeding and pelvic pain has returned.....I am taking it until my hysterectomy surgery in a couple of weeks...it certainly helps with abnormal bleeding but serious side effects are present....,F,41,3  months,12/28/2006Email,Aygestin
116, 4, heavy and prolonged bleeding,body shape change_ insomnia and mood swings,stopped bleeding very quickly so that's the good news. the bad news is within a week_ my breasts have shrunk_ my waistline has almost disappeared and my thighs puffed up. it also gives me a burning feeling inside and makes it very difficult to fall asleep when i take the last tablet late at night. i am not sure if that's what one calls mood swing but i am more sensitive and cry more easily. i am thankful that the drug saved my life but i will be extremely hesitant about taking this long term because the thickening in the mid section will encourage me to eat less (when i really need the nutrients) and exercise more (when i am already feeling so tired). no matter what the pharmaceutical companies or the doctors say_ unless it's a matter of life and death_ this cannot be good for people long term. i would check out the more natural remedies such as acupuncture and herbs as a maintenance which gives me a better sense of well being and better for the body overall.,F,51,11  days,9/18/2006,Aygestin
