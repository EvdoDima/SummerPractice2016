12, 3, Essential Thrombocythemia JAK2 neg,I started at HDXY 500mgs for the first week but they did nothing to bring my plts down.  In fact they went down by 200 and then shot back up!  2 Weeks ago my chemo dosage was upped to 1000mgs 1X daily.  At first the side effects were awful (but I do tend to suffer with side effects on any medication).  Headaches that would last for days_ nausea which lasted for hours (despite the anti-sickness meds)_ knuckle joint pain to the point of them locking and not being able to make a fist_ mouth ulcers and constipation.  The side effects seem to have subsided a lot now and I'm just a little more tired than usual with the odd headache and nausea (new anti-sickness meds work a treat!) so any side effects dissipate very quickly.,"I was diagnosed with ET by a routine blood test and since that day I've had so many tests I've lost count including scans_ ultra-sounds etc.  I have my bloods done once or twice a week.  I found out last Thursday that I do NOT have ET after all as my overactive bone marrow test came back negative.  My consultant calls me a ""medical mystery"" as he was 90% sure I had ET.  My JAK2 gene was also negative.  I'm now being tested for Chronic Leukemia which is frustrating as I have been asking for weeks if I have blood cancer and each time I am told ""no"".  The goods news is that since I've been on double dose chemo my plts are coming down_ albeit gradually_ but they are coming down so clearly its working and I'm going in the right direction.  I was told I was 75% risk of a stroke so I suppose the very mild side effects I get now are tolerable in comparison to the alternative.  I was/am concerned about being on chemo for life but even more concerned that I'm taking this drug and no-one seems to be able to diagnose me!  Either way_ the chemo is working and the plts are going in the right direction.  It would be nice to find a patient ""group"" whereby you could talk to other people who are experiencing the same rather than just leaving a review.",F,48,28  days1000 1X D,3/3/2016,Hydrea

There was some slight stomach concerns all along_ generally with a fever. I could never tell if it was from a lowered immune system. Did not need time off from work_  but is frustrating at times.

35, 3, Essential Thrombocythemia,Tired_ not clear headed_ sleep 9 to 12 hours and wake up in a fog. Lower leg pain. Mid back pain. Sometimes I think I'm really losing it. Make list to stay focused.,After I was diagnosed in October 2012_ I have the mutated gene crap_ I was only taking 1 325mg aspirin. I had a few different episodes - #1; almost lost my right little toe_ #2;had vision issues in one eye for a few hours & was put on Hydrea. Note: Most likely had it from my mid 30's_ tried to donate plates to a friend_ got a call from Emory that something was bad with my plates - at 30 I blow it off. Back to the story: After 6 months tracking plates - the 500mg twice a day along with once a day Procardia 30mg & Plavix 75mg. The stuff works_ my plates were 110_000 to 120_000 now they routinely track from 250 to 350. But the impact to the bloods go stuff are troubling. I travel for my job and have had major upper sinus and chest infections that take me weeks to fully recover from. I had enough - went to my Dr. last Thursday (1 week) and he reduced the dose to 500mg/day - one week out no improvement. 3 more weeks to see where my plates stabilized at. Strange as it may seem_ hydrocodone 10mg does help me come out of the fog and focus. But more 1 a day does tends to make me feel worse. Has anyone tried prescription Cannabis / marijuana to deal with the side effects? I live in Georgia and no way are they going to follow some of the western states  making it legal.

76, 5, Blood Disease - Myleoperliferative,I am on so much medication due to other conditions such as Atrial Fibration and Diabetes_ I am not sure if I have any side effects.  I had four infarcations to my spline prior to being diagnosed with this blood disease in September 2000.  Since taking this medicine_ my red blood cell counts have been normal and no more infarctions.No one will admit if my Atrial Fib is due to my disease but everything seem to happen in September of 2000.  Looking back on my medical records show that I had an elevated red blood cell count since 1997.  At first I lost weight but once my heart medication was changed in May of 2003_ I started to gain weight.  I am more that satisfied with Hydrea as comparied to the alternatives that would certainly have been dying from the infarctions.My Oncologist feels that I am a success story and I see him every 6 months.,This drug is very inexpensive and readily available from Pharmacies.,F,67,7  years,2/5/2007Email,Hydrea
