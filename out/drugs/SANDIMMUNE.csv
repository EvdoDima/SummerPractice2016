0, 1, Liver transplant,Cancer_ kidney failure_ cataracts_ abdominal upsets (dirrhea)_ severe weight loss_ skin cancers and other skin problems_ sleep disorder_ hair loss_ bone degeneration and death,This drug killed my husband's perfectly healthy kidneys causing death.  Why does the FDA allow this drug to be on the market knowing that it will destroy the kidneys?  My husband died at 63 little by little suffering greatly until the end.  With all the medical research and break-through for other conditions_ why is there no better anti-rejection drug?,M,62,20  years75 mg 2X D,5/14/2010Email,Sandimmune
