0, 4, Total med induced Impotence,When I first started to use Muse I had a mild burning sensation.  The more I use it the less I have this problem.,I am pleased with Muse.   I use 1000mcg pellets.  I've learned that you have to follow the instructions to the letter.  Urination directly before insertion of the MUSE is a huge plus in getting the drug to work.  My Urologist suggested a small dab of Surgilube on the applicator tip before inserting into the urethera.  This helps slide it in and minimizes discomfort.  *Note using it in conjuction with Actis is a plus for me.  I don' t know if they suggest this but I think its a great combo.,M,48,1  years,5/24/2007Email,Muse
