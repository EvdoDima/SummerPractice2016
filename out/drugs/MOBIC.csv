0, 1, Knee Pain,"DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. DO NOT LET FRIENDS OR LOVED ONES TAKE THIS MEDICATION. My doctor's assistant told me it was imperative to take this medication same time every day. I was compliant but unaware of the LONG half-life of MOBIC (Meloxicam) and the implications thereof. Due to the 20 hour half life_ at 15mg per day by day 3 my body was already in a 'toxic' state. I experienced moderate nausea_ lethargy_ dizziness_ vertigo_ complete loss of appetite_ stomach pain_ diarrhea and generalized feeling ""unwell."". Due to the knee pain I continued taking 15 mg. On day 14 I wound up in the Emergency Room with severe dizziness/vertigo_ violent vomiting_ inability to stand/wallk/move_ rapid pulse_ severe shaking and chills. My LIVER enzymes went through the roof and increased 10 fold. Afterward I went on-line and discovered how dangerous this medication was. It barely took the edge off the knee pain and wound up landing me in the ER. I was lucky_ this medication was on its way to",DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!,F,51,14  days15MG 1X D,8/14/2016Email,Mobic

24, 1, Groin pain,This pill was prescribed to help dull the pain of a pulled ligament in my groin. The only effect it had on me was a change to my mood.

I had awful morbid thoughts and got very depressed. I didnt want to leave the house etc. Finally it clicked that lt might be Meloxicam. I unfortunately have to stop. I tried cutting the dose but even then l noticed my mood changed not long after l took it. It has been a scary 2 months_ thinking it was just menopausal symptoms.

30, 2, severe back pain,First I've had my eyelid swell a couple of  times. Not sure if related or what. But noticed right away my stomach hurt sooooooooooo bad I began eating tums trying to help the pain. I've had loose stools since taking this (I never do!!!!). I have anxiety and this seems to make my breathing capabilities worse. Have to take extra klonopin to calm down. I thought I'd give it a try though since it's helped my mom after her hip replacement. I've not noticed any change in my pain. Took today for the last time. Also I've had a voracious appetite since starting it! I eat alot as it is (I've got  a high metabolism & need to eat constantly or I feel sick). However I just can't seem to get FULL after starting this and have put on a little weight-which in my case isn't a bad thing but still!!! The constant hunger (my stomach constantly grumbles no matter how much I eat) is annoying! Not to mention again the extreme stomach pains!!!!! Thought maybe I was getting sick the way my stomach constantly hurts and too many tums made me go to the bathroom! :(,I'm glad I read other people's comments because I thought my stomach pains were due to something else. As far as recommending this I'm not 1 to ask. Only took 10 days!,F,38,10  days15 mg,8/8/2015,Mobic

34, 1, Severe migraines,Horrific experience. I am generally a very happy and healthy person. I had a horrible migraine one day and took this medication because my doctor said it would stop. The pain stopped for a little then I got insanely sleepy after the sleepy spell I had the worst panic attack of my life. I could not breathe_ could not stop crying and my pulse was racing. 2-3 hours after I took the medication this feeling lasted. I had severe chest pain_ sever vertigo_ sever dizziness_ anxiety through the roof_ horrific depression and the worst was it made me feel very jittery and confused. Worst experience of my life.,Would never tell/allow anyone to take this. Ever.,F,21,1  days7 MG,7/24/2015Email,Mobic
35, 1, bursitis_ arthritis and back pain,The prescription said I could take it twice a day but most days took it only once a day. At first I took it every other day and then the pain got worse so I started taking it daily. It really helped the pain. When we went on vacation I started taking it twice daily as we were on our feet a lot and the pain had gotten worse. Again it took care of the pain. Coming home I noticed my feet were severely swollen_ it took 3 days for the swelling to disappear. Well now in the last couple of days I have started experiencing shortness of breath when playing with our dog_ insomnia_ extreme tiredness and some depression. I looked up the side effects for Meloxicam and found this site. I had already stopped taking this med a couple of days ago to see if it might be causing these symptoms_ well upon reading  just a few reviews I will not take it anymore. Will let it get out of my system and then get a different prescription for my pain.,,F,61,4  months7.5,7/20/2015,Mobic
36, 3, Back pain,Immediately I found myself having to play down the depressive symptoms I felt. The medication worked sensationally at reducing my pain_ so I had a vested interest to stick with_ yet as each day passed_ I felt a gloom overcome me. Then_ one night as I lay in bed with my eyes closed_ I suddenly found myself imagining hanging myself_ and out of some sort of morbid curiosity_ I let it play out in my head. When I reached the end I immediately burst out in tears (I'm not a crier)_ and no sooner had I caught my breath_ than the whole thing started playing out in my head again_ at which time I leaped off the bed_ and did everything I could do to break the replay. I never took Mobic again_ and I have never had that experience again. The thing that made the ideation most scary was the fact that I hung myself in a loving way_ which made it even more disturbing_ like I was being lovingly put out of my misery by myself. One of the most frightening experiences I have ever had.,I would suggest using this medication once in a while_ single dose only. In my opinion_ it is not safe for continual use.,F,50,21  days7.5MG 2X D,7/2/2015,Mobic
37, 1, Ankle pain,High blood pressure_ chest pain_ dizziness_ dehydration_ numbness in leg,I took this medicine for a week and kept feeling worse.  I was out in the heat one day and thought I was having a heat stroke.  My chest was tight_ I was lightheaded_ and my legs felt like rubber. When I got home my blood pressure was 150/104 and I've never had high blood pressure. Went off of mobic and two days later I was feeling normal again.  The side effects were way worse than the pain.,M,28,7  days,6/29/2015,Mobic
38, 3, Osteoarthritis,Stomach pains/jabs. Tightness in chest similar feeling to indigestion except more tight and crushing sensation.,Day one didn't seem to do much for the pain and felt a little nausea - dosage was one tablet in the morning of 7.5mg straight after food. Day two (same dosage) relieved a lot of the pain but stomach pains started within an hour. Felt the need to eat to try and relieve the pains. Despite the stomach pain I was so happy to have relief from the pain from being an extreme 10 to being down to a 6 or 7. Unfortunately by early evening the tightness in my chest started and it worried me and the stabbing pains in my stomach got a little tighter and more uncomfortable. These symptoms led me here and now I'm worried about taking any more due to the chest tightness. No use being out of pain and ending up with serious heart problems. Very worrying and not sure what the long term pain management options are instead. My pharmacist who filled the script said he didn't like this drug as it causes stomach ulcers and other nasties. Be wary of this drug!,F,46,2  days7.5 1X D,6/5/2015,Mobic
39, 1, Rheumatoid arthritis,After 7 days on this drug my entire abdomen broke out in tiny red dots. Along w it my entire body began trembling and there is a severe burning pain on my upper left side. After several trips to the er and a two day hospital stay_ doctors can't tell me how to fix it. 5 months later the pain in my side is horrendous_ the dots on my abdomen never went away and the all over body trembling still occurs randomly. Dangerous drug in my opinion!,,F,38,7  days7.5,5/2/2015,Mobic

41, 2, RA,It worked decent on my inflammation and pain until the 3rd day.I'm getting older and more achey so I take more ibuprofen than I should. My Md thought I was taking too much over the counter ibuprofen and that my new onset GERD was a result of that. I also have lupus but pretend like I don't because my body metabolizes meds poorly. I use essential oils and homeopathic remedies from health food store_ and watch what I eat. From what I've researched the meds are worse than my flares (just get aches and hives) I go to dentist for a cavity=numb for 12 hours. But my doc talked me in to trying Mobic_ I wish I hadn't.,Uncontrolled crying on 3rd day_ awful!! Cannot stop crying!!! I have been crying at work for two days now! (thank God its at a hospital and my nurses understand_ I showed them this web page-great discussion). I would rather live in pain and take OTC ibuprofen then be weepy all day. Sticking to my homeopathic remedies from now on.,F,45,4  days7.5 mg 1X D,4/18/2015Email,Mobic

43, 1, Leg muscle pain,Increased depression_ stress_ irritability_ mood swings_ crabby_ lost interest in everything_ pretty much every negative mood you can think of I experienced it the whole time. Recently I've had nausea and don't have an appetite so I've lost 6lbs and 5% body fat.,Due to me almost losing my family last week I've been trying to figure out why I have been acting so terribly lately. I never once thought it could be the Meloxicam but I decided to google it's side effects today. Omg so many people have had the same experiences I've had while taking this drug. My Dr said it was just like taking Ibuprofen so I never suspected it could be causing these symptoms. I just thought I was a crazy terrible person! I'm so glad I came across these reviews so I can get off this crap and get my life back!,F,27,10  weeks15mg,3/24/2015Email,Mobic

45, 1, joint pain_ inflammation_ sciatica,Burning stomach_ increasing anger and depression.,When I refilled a 2-year old mostly untaken prescription of Mobic I told the pharmacist it made me really crabby_ and he said he took it too and it also made him crabby_ but thought it was only him. I'm glad to see it's not just us_ it's a real thing and I'm not going to take it any more. Each of the 5 days since my last dose my mood has improved thank heavens. After many years of being alone I found a wonderful partner_ but this foul mood Mobic put me in made me difficult to be around. Unacceptable!!!,F,62,5  days7.5 1X D,2/24/2015Email,Mobic
46, 1, shoulder inflammation/arthritis,Super emotional_ constipated_ anxiety_ no relief from pain associated.,Dr won't recommend a cortisone shot to bring inflammation down_ said arthritis isn't cause of severe pain_ put me on arthritis meds anyway. After a week of taking them_ I just would cry all the time over nothing. Elevated my anxiety. And it never helped with any of the pain. Stopped taking it and mood is improving_ pain is no different. I'm not impressed with this drug. They initially gave me toradol which worked wonders but is apparently very harsh on your system so you can't get more than 10 pills a month. Wish there was something more like this to help...or that they would just do the stupid cortisone shot.,F,38,7  days7.5mg 2xd,2/23/2015,Mobic
47, 5, fibromyalgia,Some diarrhea. Stomach distention. Bruising. Increased sleep quality.,The day after my first dose I had an upset stomach. I actually had an accident in my pants. I thought it was gas_ but was sorely mistaken. The pain however was very much decreased. I cut back to 7.5 mg for 3 days and got less pain relief results. I started taking 15 mg  again_ and have had no diarrhea_ and the only side effects I can tell is stomach distention which I can live with. I've  also had some bruising. My sleep quality is unbelievably better. I have a sleep disorder_ and insomnia has almost ruined my life. I am now getting 9 hours of sleep per night. I'm trying to see if I can cut that back to 8 hours because that's what my sleep disorder doctor has prescribed for me. I use the  Sleep Cycle app_ and according to it I have been getting better sleep quality. In the upper 90% which is incredible!  I usually get 3 good nights of sleep staggered throughout the week. The pain is not completely gone_ but I no longer have severe pain. I can put my shirt on and take it off with no pain. I can roll over at night with no pain.,F,46,8  days15 mg 1X D,1/8/2015,Mobic

I've tried taking it with water_ milk_ food_ and nothing changes the side effects. The nausea is severe and debilitating at times for me and often comes and goes all day_ also noticed a lack of true appetite. No real stomach pain just some minor bloating. The nose bleeds just started and are very minor_ not requiring much attention and usually just present when I'm blowing my nose.

Every 2 to 3 mins I am trying  to yawn but can't get enough breath. This lasts for about 20 mins. Then I'm OK for about 5 mins then the palpitations start and breathing issues start. I am allergic to Ultram and can't take ibuprofen_ naproxen all cause the same side effects. I went to the Dr office today cause since the 1st injection the nerve pain has been more sever. I saw a different PA. I don't think she read my file cause I did out my allergies on the paper work when I first went there 2 months  ago. I WILL NOT ever take this med again. It did not help with the actual pain. I also have a history of heart problems in my family and have had TIAs_ they are stroke like symptoms. Y would she give me this?

56, 1, joint pain,First week on 7.5mg stool became dark_ sticky_ foul smelling. Second week stomach cramping daily along w/urgency to snack between meals in effort to try calming onset of burn & churn in gut. Chose to endure these discomforts_ thought body was adjusting to new med & GI pain would pass in time. My joint pain was lessened on Mobic making it possible for me to walk w/o limping_ a big relief. Woke up in middle of night w/severe stomach pain - cramping_ bloating_ burping_ burning upwards & downwards - on 14th day of Mobic and saw bright red blood seep out of my stool. Doctor told me go to the ER if symptoms worsen & discontinue the medicine. One week later_ I am still in pain with distended stomach and too scared to take acid inhibitor like doc said because experience proves me to be the rare side effect person.

I felt a rush several times_ but it did not reoccur after about a week of taking it.,It took about 2 weeks and the pain in my foot subsided and has almost gone away. Before I took this medicine I got to where I could only wear certain shoes as the pain became so severe that I could not walk. I took it for 30 days and it really helped me. I plan to take another series of doses to fend it off from coming back as I am going on a vacation where I will have to walk a great deal. I am very active physically and work out to stay in shape. I'm not sure I could have continued getting a lot of exercise without this medicine.,M,70,30  days,3/25/2009,Mobic
128, 1, osteoarthritis,Extreme swelling of feet and ankles. Have chills on a regular basis. Now in the process of finding out what other damage has occured.,I am the long term user that posted July '08.  Unknown to me that was when all my problems began.  I am now off of Mobic and plan to endure the pain until I can find a replacement.  My liver emzymes became elevated_ liver has become enlarged_ spleen is enlarged. A liver biospy was scheduled and ended up being canceled due to such a low platelet count and a high bleeding time. Now I will have to go through platelet infusion hoping to bring the platelet count up enough to do this procedure. It was to my advantage that sop was to do the platelet count and a bleeding time or I could have bled to death. I firmly believe all of these stem back to long term Mobic usage.  I was on it for at least 8 years I know. Yes it worked but now the side affects are killing me. I am hoping that all of this works out.  I also hope that I can find something else for the constant pain.,F,60,8  years,2/9/2009Email,Mobic
129, 4, pinched nerve_ carpal tunnel,Sleeplessness_ dry mouth_ constipation_ weight gain/fluid,"Mobic has been effective in helping keep down the worst symptoms of my carpal tunnel syndrome.  I have carpal tunnel in both hands and a pinched nerve - which my physician refers to as a ""double-crush"" injury.  Basically_ he has told me I will likely be taking mobic for the rest of my life.  I didn't think it was helping_ and stopped taking it for about a week.  I then realized just how much it was helping with the inflammation in my hands_ particularly.  So I started taking it again and will likely continue to take it.  The side effects are helped by increased fluid intake_ with the exception of the sleeplessness_ for which I have not found a solution.",F,47,10  months,1/13/2009,Mobic

I can't claim that this drug will work for everybody_ but I would recommend that anyone with back problems at least TRY it!  It has practically no side effects and I've taken it every day for practically a year.  It's definitely my miracle drug_ plus it has to be one of the cheapest drugs on the market... I only pay $4 for a 30 day supply!  My only worry is that I'll have to take it forever... if I miss a few days I definitely feel the pain_ so I know somewhere down the road I'll STILL need to have an operation.

While it is not nearly as effective as quickly as Vioxx was_ the 15 mg tablet will make mild to moderate pain go away most of the time_ and decrease severe pain to a not so noticeable degree.  If they could come out with a slightly more effective dose it would be great_ but for now it does its job well most of the time.

I started it again and within 3-5 days started to feel the side effects.  Side effects subsided within 2 days of stopping Mobic.,I found out Mobic contains thiazine_ which is an antidepressant_ and apparently interacted with the low-dose of Zoloft that I take daily.  This happened in 2% of the clinical trial sample of 16_000_ but apparently my doctor didn't think that was significant enough to mention.  After stopping Mobic and asking my doctor again_ he said that I will have the same problems with all of the powerful anti-inflammatories and steriods that are used to combat inflammation.  So if you're on any anti-depressants check if the anti-inflammatory you're being prescribed contains thiazine_ a thiazine derivative_ or any other anti-depressant.,F,34,18  days,4/5/2007,Mobic

Great!  Then this year_ took it for a week for tendonitis_ it helps with the inflammation_ but OH MY GOODNESS_ I got so agitated I couldn't focus on my job_ couldn't sleep_ and then the flu-like stuff hit.  I have never been chilled so much for so long_ I lived holding the heating pad_ and the body aches_ UGH.  I thought I had a virus_ but went off the mobic_ virus got well.  Resumed taking Mobic_ same symptoms came back.  Stopped the drug_ symptoms went away.  Only after digging through the PDR did I find this flu-like side effect was documented in the clinical trials.  Totally not worth it.  I wanted to die.  Mobic is metabolized by a liver enzyme I am deficient in_ and with age_ the levels of these enzymes drop_ so that may be why I can no longer tolerate it.
