0, 4, Menopause symptoms: hot flashes,None really. Trying to reduce amount from 1 pump per day to 1 pump three times a week. I am 66 years old and want to get off product. Hot flashes are controlled using it. When I do not use it regularly the hot flashes are not live able. I have them all day long_ about every ten minutes_ without the product.,The gel takes a few minutes to be rubbed into skin.,F,66,2  years 1X D,6/30/2014,Estrogel

2, 1, Hot flashes and vaginal dryness,Rapid weight gain with diarrhea.  Severe bloating and not feeling well.,,F,60,4  weeks2 pumps 1X D,2/12/2013,Estrogel
3, 2, Menopause symptoms,acne_ weight gain_ bloating_ rage_ mood swings_ constipation_ hot flashes,Switched from Premarin because of synthetic HRT concerns. I like the ease of use and knowing the drug isn't going through my major organs to do its job. At first I thought it was okay_ but now_ I am bloated all the time_ am constipated_ have huge pimples pop up under my skin_ and had one moment the other day that caused me to know the meaning of temporary insanity. Might have committed murder - I was so angry. Even my husband who has known me for 20+ years said he has never seen me so angry...and he HAS seen me angry.  I can only attribute it to the switch from Premarin to Estrogel.  I am going to a new doctor to find out what is going on and fix this mess - do I have to have any HRT at all?  I hope I am told no.,F,55,3  monthsone pump 1X D,8/3/2010,Estrogel
