0, 3, sinus/upper respiratory,First day took meds at dinner with food and had severe stomach pain/nausea throughout the night.  Horrible taste in mouth_ dizzy_ insomnia_ sweats.  Phoned Dr. to see if I could switch medication and was advised to take medication in the morning so that it has time to work it self out of your system.  Drink lots of water and move around as much as possible.  After doing this it was more tolerable.  I still felt dizzy/week and mild upset stomach_ but by day 5 I was feeling much better.  My Dr. advised that she recommended this drug for a reason and needed something to get rid of my 3 back to back sinus infections.  Hopefully this does the trick!,,F,44,10  days1000 1X D,1/24/2016,Biaxin xl

7, 5, Hypersomnia,Insomnia_ mental confusion_ lower back pain(muscular)_ depression_ acidic stomach_ mild headache.It helped a lot reading the truth about this drug here. The only thing that I found was almost intolerable_ was the lower back pain_ but I managed to mitigate this some with stretching exercises.I agree that it's a poison_ of sorts. But for the purposes I needed it_ I was willing to accept that.,First off_ let me say that the reason I'm satisfied with the medication_ despite the side effects_ is that my physician prescribed it for me to test the effect_ on my problem with daytime sleepiness possibly related to my GABA-A receptors. This test proved that I may benefit from other more tolerable medications which help me modify this receptor's sensitivity.,M,53,10  days1000,7/18/2015,Biaxin xl
8, 3, Chest throat sinus infection,The first night I had a strong metalic taste_ woke up in night soaked from sweat_ upset stomach_ my hands felt weird_ bad dream.

12, 1, Sinus infection,I started having a horrible tooth ache. Dr. Did a ct scan and found a small amount  of inflammation and said it might be causing the pain. He prescribed me biaxin to fight it. The first time I took it I went to sleep with no issues. At this point I had been awake for 3 days in agony from my tooth which turns out was unrelated to the sinus inf. when I woke up I had no appetite when I went to get food_ and I was having some bowel issues. I was compleatly unable to sleep that night. I just wasn't tired and couldn't even keep my eyes closed.  The next day while at work I noticed a weird feeling in my back_ kinda like a euphoric feeling but it's not fun. Over the corse of the day I started getting nausea and twords the ravening I started feeling as if I wasn't in control of my body. My legs were shaking and I was extreamly paranoid. I went to the chow hall and basically had a panic attack because I was so freaked out by what was going on. Later that evening I went to the we because I thought I was allergic or something and when I told them what was happening they basically said I won't die and go away. Now it's 3am and I'm still having the weird feeling in my back and still feel kinda loopy (lack of sleep?) iv got the dry mouth and metallic tast everyone is describing .

13, 1, Sinus/Ear infection,My first day of 2 pills was completely fine_ UNTIL I woke up this morning with the most horrible taste in my mouth..it actually woke me up! I felt ok though_ got dressed for work and drove off. 15min into my commute I broke out in sweats_ heart palps_ ringing in ear_ blurred vision_ etc. About to literally faint_ while driving. I had to pull over and actually take my socks and shoes off because they felt like they were suffocating me(crazy_ right)and put my head between my knees. I put the air on high and sat in car_ the feeling went away so I stated back to work again and then it all hit me again. I called my hub_ in complete panic and tears_ and he had to come get me from the store I had to pull over at. This_ after 1 day_ of being on this med!! And I'm still sick_ 8hrs later. I have never experienced anything like it. Stay away from Biaxin!! There are other antibiotics that can help_ I really felt like I was going to have a heart attack or pass out while driving....it's not worth it!!! I've ready numerous similar  reviews of others experience_ this is a horrible antibiotic. I must say my ear and sinuses felt drastic relief in just 1 day but risks do not outweigh the benefit.,,F,34,1  days500mg,7/30/2014,Biaxin xl

I was begging my boyfriend to take me to the hospital because I thought I was going to die. Terrible taste in my mouth even a day after stopping the medication_ terrible gas and bloating.

Got shots of promethizine and other anti nausea med (Zofran). Never been so sick in my life! I usually take Zithromax and have no problem. The Dr. said  they have never seen this reaction before!

The final straw was that I just didn't feel mentally normal anymore_ although I don't know how I could have put up with 6 more days of that taste in my mouth and the nausea. There is no way I will ever take this demon medication ever again.,M,31,4  days1000 1X D,3/5/2014,Biaxin xl

Between 2-3 days on the med I was crying uncontrollably and did not know why. I had anxiety about going back to work. Things I don't normally experience. On day 5 and the doubling over super low abdominal pain is back! I am stopping this medicine immediately!!,,F,28,5  days250mg,1/24/2014,Biaxin xl

Have not taken very last tablet as only just realised it is the meds that may be the cause. Felt poorly with pluracy befor I took them but got worse once taken. Doctor and consultant at hospital do not seem to be aware of these side effects. Either that or they just aren't saying anything. Can't wait to get them out of my system so I can re-evaluate my own health. Feel sad for anyone else having this problem. Keep strong and positive_ that's what in trying to do.

This got worse every time I took it until now I have been on it for 3 days thos time and have decided I can no longer tolerate it mentaly at all_ it puts me in mental hell. Feelings of unreality_ depersonalisation_ cofusion_ anxiety_ depression with uncontrolable crying_ pessimistic thinking_ worries.....feelings of darkness_ just insane hell. Its a shame as its one of only a few antibiotics I am not allergic too and it is an effective antibiotic_ it does its job but now the downside outways the benefit_ I would rather be ill with sinusitus than suicidally nuts. Not recomended for those with already existing mental health probs_ anxiety issues... vulnerable or suseptable individuals IMO.,,F,34,3  days250-500 mg,12/7/2013,Biaxin xl

25, 1, ,Absolute living Hell last two days. Anxiety attacks lasting 4 hours which leave me speechless and just crying from the fear of nothing and the associated depression.,"Was a little weepy whilst taking it but not enough to make the link. On day 5 (11 pills from the 14 prescribed) I had an almighty anxiety attack at 2am until 4.30am when suddenly I felt tired and slept albeit not much.  Then later that day terrible depression...unable to focus on anything like TV or literally anything...crying.Slept OK that night but disturbed kept waking up briefly every hour_ thought I was getting past the anxiety until I had another one that started at 3pm until 7.30pm... wanted to die...literally..then it started to lift and I was ""ok"" but I am depressed due to the fear of the next attack.Its been 48 hours since I took the last tablet... so worried I won't recover which of course is all part if the anxiety and irrational thinking. Not had this level of anxiety for many years and am wondering if I had taken antibiotics back then but did not make the connection.Would LOVE to hear from others who have had similar experiences with Clarithromycin aka Biaxin and who DID recover from the side effects. Please do not contact me with horror stories of those that are still depressed or anxious as right now_ I think that would be counter productive.

27, 1, Sinus Infection,SEVERE UNGODLY HUNGER. I eat and eat and can't get full. I feel like I'm going to throw up from how hungry I am. It has caused me to lose weight_ have insomnia_ feel light headed_ be euphoric_ and have the worse metal taste in my mouth. All of this and I've only been on it two days! It's to the point that I've actually had to call my doctor on the emergency after hours line to see if they can give me anything to counter the side effects.,It seems to be working to clear the infection_ so I am only seeking medications to counter the side effects. Though I must say_ it's becoming rather alarming how terribly hungry I am. I can deal with no sleep and feeling weak... But this is something completely different than any side effect I have ever come across. It honestly feels like I haven't had food in a day and yet I'm currently eating!

I am going to stop the medication today and go to my family dr. because I have not slept in three nights! I am a very sound sleeper and this has never happened to me before. I have the most awful taste in my mouth and pain in my stomach and around the kidneys. The cough seems to be drying up but the nausea is making me feel as though I am pregnant. I threw up from the nausea on the first night. I detest this medicine and will never take it again. Hopefully I will be able to sleep tonight after I get something else for this infection. It's 4:45 in the morning and I am wide awake!

I've taken this before and vaguely remember the side effects_ but I instinctively knew this medicine would make me feel yucky. With this prescription I took a round of prednisone_ and had some cough syrup. I finished the prednisone_ only took the cough syrup as needed_ and took 9 days of a 10 day dose of Biaxin XL. I can't stand the distended belly_ gas_ diarrhea and the general discomfort all over my body-- it's UNBEARABLE!! so I quit taking it yesterday and I am STILL waiting for my belly to return to it's normal state!!,F,48,9  days 1X D,9/4/2012,Biaxin xl

When my body comes down with a chest cold the liklihood of developing bronchitis is very high regardless of what I do to curb the sickness. My body seems to produce an uncommonly high amount of mucus making my lungs feel as though they are heavy filled with glue. I've taken Biaxin XL twice for bronchitis and experienced positive results with no side effects.

I have absolutely no record of previous mental illness or instability_ but this literally made me feel as though I was going insane. I called the pharmacist and he claimed there was no reason it should cause anxiety or anything of the sort but I can assure you it did. I was only on the pills for two days_ but I also cut up the pills the first day since I have trouble taking large pills which may have put it into my system a lot faster. Last night was absolutely terrible_ I could not calm myself down I was convinced I was going crazy and I did not feel like myself at all. My heart was racing because I was so terrified_ I could not control my thoughts or calm down for a second. It was impossible to sleep until finally I was just so exhausted that I passed out. It persisted until the next day (today). When I went to class I could not focus on what the profs were saying_ I felt totally out of it and just could not slow down my mind. I would describe it as a numb feeling_ I wasn't happy nor sad_ just scared out of my mind. I thought I was having a mental breakdown. I've never in my life experienced anything remotely like this. It was the most terrifying experience ever. The second I got home I flushed those pills down the toilet. I would way rather have a sinus infection than risk feeling this way again.

I already suffered from depression & anxiety prior to taking this medication but those issues were stabilized.  Now I'm in a mess and wondering when the effects of this medication will wear off.  I'm sharing my experience not to keep someone from taking the medication but just to tell an honest rating.

57, 5, Chronic Bronchitis with Asthma,Slight nausea and loss of appetite_ slight diarrhea and stomach cramp right after I take the medication.,I have taken this drug 3 times (for three different exacerbations of bronchitis due to a cold or flu). It worked well and I felt better after a day or two but followed the doctor's orders and took it each time for the full 10 days. I didn't feel much like eating and was slightly nauceous but that could be from the illness. I have a chronic problem with asthma/COPD and when I get sick_ my doctor pulls out 'the big guns'. He usually gives me prednisone as well but didn't this time_ as taking a steroid continually has serious side effects. I read all the horror stories but Biaxin just helps me. I always sleep well. I did have a strange dream but big deal_ who is to say the drug caused that? I always drink buttermilk with this medication to try to maintain the normal flora of the digestive system and eat a bigger breakfast than usual to keep the nausea to a minimum. Maybe the people who wrote the horror stories are either sensitive to this drug or downright allergic. It has helped me 3 times so far_ I trust my doctor to give me the appropriate drug and my side effects are no worse than when I take any antibiotic and most of those don't help me.,F,57,10  days1000mg 1X D,1/16/2011,Biaxin xl

I eventually called health link after being awake for about 36 hours and was told to discontinue using the product. The health link worker then transferred me to a pharmacist who transferred me to Poison Control who suggested I go to the ER. I instead discontinued use of product and began to feel better. Neither my doctor or pharmacist_ nor the people at health link claimed to have ever heard of these types of symptoms_ yet here we are with hundreds of posts by people who have experienced similar symptoms. It felt very similar to being on a stimulant_ such as cocaine or speed_ and Wikipedia (take it for what it's worth) claimed that the drug could even cause false positives for cocaine tests. I was prescribed Biaxin XL 500mg for 10 days_ but discontinued after 48 hrs (4 pills) because of how it was affecting me and because of the advice of the people I spoke with at the time.I don't want to sound like an alarmist_ and from what I have been able to undercover the majority of people do not experience the types of symptoms I_ and others here have listed_ but I do find it alarming that insomnia is not listed as a side effect.

My stomach burned like it was on fire; it felt like the drug was eating my stomach from the inside out. I was unable to sleep much of the night due to the cramps and bad gas.  My husband couldn't believe the sounds coming from my gut. I was supposed to take it for 14 days_ but decided right away to stop for fear of worse side effects to come. I have never reacted this way to any drug in my life!

A possible side effect that concerns me is I have been sweating night and day sweats all day long with no fever_ since I started BIAXIN XL_ I asked my Dr. and I was told sweating helps the body to get rid of bacteria but today is my 9th day of sweating_ Strange !!!! I have never had a problem with side effects in the past on any medication!!! Anyone else experiencing sweating? Your comments will be appreciated!!!! Thanks_,Currently on Biaxin XL on a 10-day medication for a Pneumonia infection. I think so far my Pneumonia got better but the only thing eft is the seating!!!,M,33,10  days,5/16/2007Email,Biaxin xl

95, 5, Upper Respiratory Infection/Sinus,A little stomach discomfort_ a little gas but no bad taste_ insomnia_ dreams_ tremors or other side effects. After the 1st day_ my sinuses cleared enough that I could breathe again. It's just getting better. I'm on the 1000mg for 10 days.  The only problem with the antibiotics is the size of the pills!!!  ,"I had taken Biaxin in the past when I was still smoking and suffered more severe side effects such as diarhea_ bloating and bad taste in mouth_ heart palpitations and ""the shakes"". I'm a non-smoker now and don't suffer from any side effects.The best time to take Biaxin is at supper time. Take the medication during your meal with milk if all possible. Keep hydrated_ drink alot of water and you'll more than likely go though the 5-10 days without any major problems.",F,26,10  days,3/30/2007,Biaxin xl

98, 5, Bad cold which went into broncitis,My only side effect so far that I know for sure is BAD TASTE in my mouth every morning when I wake up. Though I read that some people have had anxiety attacks as well & I do have those. But I contribute them to having taken another medicine which just made my life a sher **** last month. I believe it's still in my system. But I can't be sure.....,I make sure to take them in the middle of a meal & I take them in the evening. Granted I wake up with a horrible taste in my mouth & that I've now lost my voice. But I do feel a lot better than I did a week ago.

Don't try to fall asleep to Lord of the Rings if you're on this drug.,Seems to be working after my 4th day on it.  I have a severe case of Strep Throat which I got after contracting Mono about a week before.   The Strep piggybacked on the mono and my immune system has been having trouble getting rid of the mono while the Strep gives me problems.  I had to go back and get a prescription for Hydrocodone and Prednisone_ both of which have been helping.  The mono really hasn't been bad_ but the Strep is very painful.,M,22,4  days,11/30/2006Email,Biaxin xl

108, 1, ,SEVERE anxiety / paranoia / insomnia_ and vivid_ frightening dreams when i could sleep / confusion / visual disturbances / HORRIBLE metallic taste / terrible nausea_ couldn't even drink water.,A one week course of Biaxin XL to treat a minor sinus infection began a series of problems that I have never recovered from.  This was about four years ago.  Within two days I developed severe anxiety and started having panic attacks_ though I had never experienced one before in my life and had no clue what was happening.  I felt crazy_ I was completely delusional.  My thoughts were constantly racing and my vision was blurry and spinning.  Add to this puking about every half an hour.  I was too out of my mind to even think it was the Biaxin that was doing this to me_ I was completely sick and out of it.  Then I started having afterimages when looking towards a light.  Typically this lasts a second to two .. mine wouldn't go away.  To this day I have three neon spots in my vision .. ALWAYS .. from looking at a ceiling light above the bed.  These never went away .. FOUR YEARS LATER!  The panic attacks never stopped either.  I had what I would refer to as a full-on nervous breakdown.  I n,F,27,7  days,7/6/2006,Biaxin xl
109, 1, Strep Throat_ Sinuses_ stiff neck,Horrible taste in mouth_ interuppted sleep -- waking up every hour_ vivid dreams_ jerking spasms in my legs while sleeping_ and most noteable a huge rash covering both of my entire legs.  The rash looks like red pimples or blisters  -- some larger than others and grouped in clusters.,I was taking 1000 milligrams.  On day 4 I noticed the rash.  I have taken Biaxin before_ but I do not believe it was this high of a dose.  Biaxin has help to alliviate my other ailments_ but I am not continuing with it due to the rash.,F,37,4  days,6/12/2006,Biaxin xl
110, 5, sinusitis,metallic taste_ mild stomach upset,Biaxin has always worked great for me with minimal side effects.  I do get the metallic taste_ but it doesn't bother me too much as I can easily get rid of it by drinking something or eating something_ or even chewing gum.  Compared to some of the other antibiotics I've tried for sinus infections_ Biaxin actually has worked the best for me with the least amount of side effects.,F,24,7  days,6/10/2006,Biaxin xl

112, 5, Chronic sinus infection,Biaxin xl is the 8th antibiotic I've been on for my massive sinus infection_ which involves all my sinuses bilaterally. I had a reaction to Avelox_ Vantin didnt work too well so my Dr stopped it_ 2 weeks on Augmentin_ it worked a little bit but had allergic reaction afterwards_ very itchy for 2 weeks_ and others ones i took in dec_ jan which I cant remember the names of_ so I am pretty desperate for this to work.  About 2 hrs after the first dose my sinuses cleared a little_ the metal taste only when i wake up i brush and it goes away_ no digestive problems at all_ I am very fatigued it could be from dealing with this since early Dec so it could be from the infection or the Biaxin & for part of the day I feel chilly but eventually warm up but that could be due to the infection too,I have another 7 days on it_ I will continue to take it. It cleared up my sinus pressure in a few days and my infection is massive_ also take it after a huge dinner and drink lots of water I got that advice from this site! I also either take acidophilus pills or eat yogurt or both. I have trouble sleeping but taking Clarinex-D_ mucinex so i think thats what is causing it_ plus I have problems on a good day with that! I do recommend this it is powerful but it works. I think even if i had a bad reaction I wouldve continued with it I'm desperate to get better!,F,50,7  days,4/8/2006,Biaxin xl

After doing a little research I quit taking it and would rather suffer than take this stuff again!  It's horrible and I always made sure to take it after eating a decent meal would hate to think how it would make you feel if you took it on an empty stomach!,F,40,2  days,3/13/2006,Biaxin xl

Day 4_ found this website and read about the side effects.  Took meds on full full stomach_ very little nausua.  Drank ruby red grapefruit drink to counter the terrible taste it leaves in your mouth.  Also_ very vivid_ sometimes scary nightmares and sore neck in the morning.  Glad to be done taking the meds.  I talked to the doc and he was unaware of the side effects.,Ask doc if there is a equal drug that you can try instead.

119, 4, Strep Throat,Metallic taste in mouth_ as mentioned by almost everyone.  The first two days I have to make sure to have enough food in my stomach to buffer the drug_ otherwise I do get sick to my stomach.,"I get strep throat very easily.  When was in high school and middle school I got it almost every year!  This time_ my first in college_ has been the worst_ and as always I got prescribed Biaxin XL.  It's not for everybody!  Antibiotics are particular_ and you need to find one that works for you!  It's not perfect...the taste and the need to eat a decent amouth with it are a hassle.  But I'm allergic to all ""cillin"" drugs and intolerant of Zithromax so Biaxin has always been a good option for me.

My Dr. was informed that I suffer from anxiety disorder and hietal hernia/acid reflux_ yet she prescribed me a drug that only exasperates my symptoms. I have had to take Ativan every day after taking the Biaxin XL just to stop my heart from racing so fast.  I usually only use Ativan once in a blue moon when suffering a serious panic attack. And once the heart does slow down_ the extreme tightness that is left in my head and cheeks is just as unbearable.  I feel so much worse than before I took these.  NEVER AGAIN.  The company does not even mention the possibility of anxiety_ I think they need to be informed.,F,30,5  days,5/8/2005,Biaxin xl
