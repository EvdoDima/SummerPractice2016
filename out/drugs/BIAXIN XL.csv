0, 3, sinus/upper respiratory,First day took meds at dinner with food and had severe stomach pain/nausea throughout the night.  Horrible taste in mouth_ dizzy_ insomnia_ sweats.  Phoned Dr. to see if I could switch medication and was advised to take medication in the morning so that it has time to work it self out of your system.  Drink lots of water and move around as much as possible.  After doing this it was more tolerable.  I still felt dizzy/week and mild upset stomach_ but by day 5 I was feeling much better.  My Dr. advised that she recommended this drug for a reason and needed something to get rid of my 3 back to back sinus infections.  Hopefully this does the trick!,,F,44,10  days1000 1X D,1/24/2016,Biaxin xl

7, 5, Hypersomnia,Insomnia_ mental confusion_ lower back pain(muscular)_ depression_ acidic stomach_ mild headache.It helped a lot reading the truth about this drug here. The only thing that I found was almost intolerable_ was the lower back pain_ but I managed to mitigate this some with stretching exercises.I agree that it's a poison_ of sorts. But for the purposes I needed it_ I was willing to accept that.,First off_ let me say that the reason I'm satisfied with the medication_ despite the side effects_ is that my physician prescribed it for me to test the effect_ on my problem with daytime sleepiness possibly related to my GABA-A receptors. This test proved that I may benefit from other more tolerable medications which help me modify this receptor's sensitivity.,M,53,10  days1000,7/18/2015,Biaxin xl
8, 3, Chest throat sinus infection,The first night I had a strong metalic taste_ woke up in night soaked from sweat_ upset stomach_ my hands felt weird_ bad dream.

12, 1, Sinus infection,I started having a horrible tooth ache. Dr. Did a ct scan and found a small amount  of inflammation and said it might be causing the pain. He prescribed me biaxin to fight it. The first time I took it I went to sleep with no issues. At this point I had been awake for 3 days in agony from my tooth which turns out was unrelated to the sinus inf. when I woke up I had no appetite when I went to get food_ and I was having some bowel issues. I was compleatly unable to sleep that night. I just wasn't tired and couldn't even keep my eyes closed.  The next day while at work I noticed a weird feeling in my back_ kinda like a euphoric feeling but it's not fun. Over the corse of the day I started getting nausea and twords the ravening I started feeling as if I wasn't in control of my body. My legs were shaking and I was extreamly paranoid. I went to the chow hall and basically had a panic attack because I was so freaked out by what was going on. Later that evening I went to the we because I thought I was allergic or something and when I told them what was happening they basically said I won't die and go away. Now it's 3am and I'm still having the weird feeling in my back and still feel kinda loopy (lack of sleep?) iv got the dry mouth and metallic tast everyone is describing . I tried to sleep but was having extreamly weird dreams or something like that where I woke up  terrified and freezing cold. Being cold is odd since I'm currently deployed to Kuwait right now.

13, 1, Sinus/Ear infection,My first day of 2 pills was completely fine_ UNTIL I woke up this morning with the most horrible taste in my mouth..it actually woke me up! I felt ok though_ got dressed for work and drove off. 15min into my commute I broke out in sweats_ heart palps_ ringing in ear_ blurred vision_ etc. About to literally faint_ while driving. I had to pull over and actually take my socks and shoes off because they felt like they were suffocating me(crazy_ right)and put my head between my knees. I put the air on high and sat in car_ the feeling went away so I stated back to work again and then it all hit me again. I called my hub_ in complete panic and tears_ and he had to come get me from the store I had to pull over at. This_ after 1 day_ of being on this med!! And I'm still sick_ 8hrs later. I have never experienced anything like it. Stay away from Biaxin!! There are other antibiotics that can help_ I really felt like I was going to have a heart attack or pass out while driving....it's not worth it!!! I've ready numerous similar  reviews of others experience_ this is a horrible antibiotic. I must say my ear and sinuses felt drastic relief in just 1 day but risks do not outweigh the benefit.,,F,34,1  days500mg,7/30/2014,Biaxin xl

I was begging my boyfriend to take me to the hospital because I thought I was going to die. Terrible taste in my mouth even a day after stopping the medication_ terrible gas and bloating.

Got shots of promethizine and other anti nausea med (Zofran). Never been so sick in my life! I usually take Zithromax and have no problem. The Dr. said  they have never seen this reaction before!

The final straw was that I just didn't feel mentally normal anymore_ although I don't know how I could have put up with 6 more days of that taste in my mouth and the nausea. There is no way I will ever take this demon medication ever again.,M,31,4  days1000 1X D,3/5/2014,Biaxin xl

Between 2-3 days on the med I was crying uncontrollably and did not know why. I had anxiety about going back to work. Things I don't normally experience. On day 5 and the doubling over super low abdominal pain is back! I am stopping this medicine immediately!!,,F,28,5  days250mg,1/24/2014,Biaxin xl

Have not taken very last tablet as only just realised it is the meds that may be the cause. Felt poorly with pluracy befor I took them but got worse once taken. Doctor and consultant at hospital do not seem to be aware of these side effects. Either that or they just aren't saying anything. Can't wait to get them out of my system so I can re-evaluate my own health. Feel sad for anyone else having this problem. Keep strong and positive_ that's what in trying to do.

This got worse every time I took it until now I have been on it for 3 days thos time and have decided I can no longer tolerate it mentaly at all_ it puts me in mental hell. Feelings of unreality_ depersonalisation_ cofusion_ anxiety_ depression with uncontrolable crying_ pessimistic thinking_ worries.....feelings of darkness_ just insane hell. Its a shame as its one of only a few antibiotics I am not allergic too and it is an effective antibiotic_ it does its job but now the downside outways the benefit_ I would rather be ill with sinusitus than suicidally nuts. Not recomended for those with already existing mental health probs_ anxiety issues... vulnerable or suseptable individuals IMO.,,F,34,3  days250-500 mg,12/7/2013,Biaxin xl

25, 1, ,Absolute living Hell last two days. Anxiety attacks lasting 4 hours which leave me speechless and just crying from the fear of nothing and the associated depression.,"Was a little weepy whilst taking it but not enough to make the link. On day 5 (11 pills from the 14 prescribed) I had an almighty anxiety attack at 2am until 4.30am when suddenly I felt tired and slept albeit not much.  Then later that day terrible depression...unable to focus on anything like TV or literally anything...crying.Slept OK that night but disturbed kept waking up briefly every hour_ thought I was getting past the anxiety until I had another one that started at 3pm until 7.30pm... wanted to die...literally..then it started to lift and I was ""ok"" but I am depressed due to the fear of the next attack.Its been 48 hours since I took the last tablet... so worried I won't recover which of course is all part if the anxiety and irrational thinking. Not had this level of anxiety for many years and am wondering if I had taken antibiotics back then but did not make the connection.Would LOVE to hear from others who have had similar experiences with Clarithromycin aka Biaxin and who DID recover from the side effects. Please do not contact me with horror stories of those that are still depressed or anxious as right now_ I think that would be counter productive.

27, 1, Sinus Infection,SEVERE UNGODLY HUNGER. I eat and eat and can't get full. I feel like I'm going to throw up from how hungry I am. It has caused me to lose weight_ have insomnia_ feel light headed_ be euphoric_ and have the worse metal taste in my mouth. All of this and I've only been on it two days! It's to the point that I've actually had to call my doctor on the emergency after hours line to see if they can give me anything to counter the side effects.,It seems to be working to clear the infection_ so I am only seeking medications to counter the side effects. Though I must say_ it's becoming rather alarming how terribly hungry I am. I can deal with no sleep and feeling weak... But this is something completely different than any side effect I have ever come across. It honestly feels like I haven't had food in a day and yet I'm currently eating!

I am going to stop the medication today and go to my family dr. because I have not slept in three nights! I am a very sound sleeper and this has never happened to me before. I have the most awful taste in my mouth and pain in my stomach and around the kidneys. The cough seems to be drying up but the nausea is making me feel as though I am pregnant. I threw up from the nausea on the first night. I detest this medicine and will never take it again. Hopefully I will be able to sleep tonight after I get something else for this infection. It's 4:45 in the morning and I am wide awake!

I've taken this before and vaguely remember the side effects_ but I instinctively knew this medicine would make me feel yucky. With this prescription I took a round of prednisone_ and had some cough syrup. I finished the prednisone_ only took the cough syrup as needed_ and took 9 days of a 10 day dose of Biaxin XL.

When my body comes down with a chest cold the liklihood of developing bronchitis is very high regardless of what I do to curb the sickness. My body seems to produce an uncommonly high amount of mucus making my lungs feel as though they are heavy filled with glue. I've taken Biaxin XL twice for bronchitis and experienced positive results with no side effects.

I have absolutely no record of previous mental illness or instability_ but this literally made me feel as though I was going insane. I called the pharmacist and he claimed there was no reason it should cause anxiety or anything of the sort but I can assure you it did. I was only on the pills for two days_ but I also cut up the pills the first day since I have trouble taking large pills which may have put it into my system a lot faster. Last night was absolutely terrible_ I could not calm myself down I was convinced I was going crazy and I did not feel like myself at all. My heart was racing because I was so terrified_ I could not control my thoughts or calm down for a second. It was impossible to sleep until finally I was just so exhausted that I passed out. It persisted until the next day (today). When I went to class I could not focus on what the profs were saying_ I felt totally out of it and just could not slow down my mind. I would describe it as a numb feeling_ I wasn't happy nor sad_ just scared out of my mind. I thought I was having a mental breakdown. I've never in my life experienced anything remotely like this. It was the most terrifying experience ever. The second I got home I flushed those pills down the toilet. I would way rather have a sinus infection than risk feeling this way again. I had been taking the pills around 12 pm each day_ and obviously skipped today and am already feeling a lo,F,19,10  days500 MG 2X D,3/5/2012Email,Biaxin xl
45, 1, Sinus infection,Racing heart_ metallic taste_ anxiety_ major insomnia and then manic dreams when I could sleep. No history of mental illness_ but symptoms bloomed with the BIAXIN XL and then went away after the drug was flushed out of my system. I stopped taking it after 5 days - thank goodness. It was scary.   	,DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG!!!  The adverse side effects are VERY serious. It is NOT worth it. Note: The adverse side effects of BIAXIN XL may be WORSE than the adverse side effects of the regular BIAXIN.   	,M,40,10  days500 2X D,2/28/2012,Biaxin xl
46, 3, Sinus infection,Okay_ I commented yesterday saying NO side effects. This is the first time I am having side effects on this medication.

50, 2, Bronchitis and Pneumonia,Awful taste_ severe headache not relieved by Ibuprofen (feels like someone is crushing my ears together)_ nausea_ loose stools_ loss of appetite_ loss of touch with reality_ panic and anxiety_ vivid nightmares_ uncontrollable crying,I rated this drug a 2 because I can tell it is kicking the infection but the side effects for me are unbearable. I already suffered from depression & anxiety prior to taking this medication but those issues were stabilized.  Now I'm in a mess and wondering when the effects of this medication will wear off.  I'm sharing my experience not to keep someone from taking the medication but just to tell an honest rating.  If you suffer from a mood disorder or BP and take a SSRI_ you might want to discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist prior to taking this drug.,F,32,3  days1000 MG 1X D,9/21/2011,Biaxin xl
51, 3, chronic sinusitis,Slight nausea_ gas and loose stools_ dizziness_ confusion_ anxiety_ increased heartrate_ headache_ insomnia_ vivid dreams_ metallic taste in mouth_ hungry constantly (holy hunger pangs_ Batman!)_ and extremely thirsty.,With corticosteroidal nasal spray_ seems to be resolving the sinusitus -- it's nice to be able to breathe again!  The side effects almost make it not worth it_ though.  Because it reduces productivity (a lot!) during the day_ and causes insomnia_ I take it in the mid to late afternoon.  I can get enough done earlier in the day_ and the sleep-related side effects are somewhat mitigated by the delay between taking it and trying to sleep.,F,29,10  days1000 1X D,4/6/2011Email,Biaxin xl

REVIEW ALL OF THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS AND DON'T EVEN START TAKING THIS DRUG; IT IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK_ NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS PRESCRIBED FOR.If you research this drug_ you will discover other people have had horrible side effects like I did.

Have I not taken this drug I probably would've been in the hospital with severe bronchitis. This drug helped me within the first 24 hours of taking it! Also_ I am on a low dose of Xanax I take at night before I go to bed for some minor anxiety_ and trouble sleeping. I didn't get any nervousness_ or psychotic thoughts while using this drug. This drug is a Godsend for people with chronic asthma and bronchitis.,F,33,5  days500 2X D,1/31/2011,Biaxin xl
55, 1, sinus infection,THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS DRUG.  DO NOT TAKE IT!  PERIOD.  IT CAUSED NASTY SIDE EFFECTS_ INCLUDING WILD DREAMS_ DISTURBED SLEEP_ AND SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO MANIC BEHAVIOR.  (I HAVE NO HISTORY OF ANY MENTAL ILLNESS.  OTHERS HAVE HAD SIMILAR SIDE EFFECTS_ WITH NO HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS.)  THE BIAXIN XL SEEMS TO BE THE WORST_ WITH LESS SIDE EFFECTS FROM REGULAR BIAXIN.  NO INFECTION IS WORTH THE RISK OF THESE SIDE EFFECTS.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  IF YOUR DOCTOR IS CASUAL ABOUT PRESCRIBING IT_ FIND A NEW DOCTOR.,,F,42,  1X D,1/27/2011,Biaxin xl
56, 2, Bronchitis,On the first 2 days I experienced severe headaches. I was told to stop taking the drug for a couple of days. However_ I didn't want my infection to get worse so on the morning of day 4 I decided to cut my dose in 1/2 from 2 tablets a dose to 1 tablet and within 2 hours I started having neck pain and muscle discomfort which lasted over 24 hours.,I think this drug should be taken off the market. I was told by my physician to stop taking the medicine and was prescribed another antibiotic.,F,38,7  days500 MG 2X D,1/20/2011,Biaxin xl
57, 5, Chronic Bronchitis with Asthma,Slight nausea and loss of appetite_ slight diarrhea and stomach cramp right after I take the medication.,I have taken this drug 3 times (for three different exacerbations of bronchitis due to a cold or flu). It worked well and I felt better after a day or two but followed the doctor's orders and took it each time for the full 10 days. I didn't feel much like eating and was slightly nauceous but that could be from the illness. I have a chronic problem with asthma/COPD and when I get sick_ my doctor pulls out 'the big guns'. He usually gives me prednisone as well but didn't this time_ as taking a steroid continually has serious side effects. I read all the horror stories but Biaxin just helps me. I always sleep well. I did have a strange dream but big deal_ who is to say the drug caused that? I always drink buttermilk with this medication to try to maintain the normal flora of the digestive system and eat a bigger breakfast than usual to keep the nausea to a minimum. Maybe the people who wrote the horror stories are either sensitive to this drug or downright allergic. It has helped me 3 times so far_ I trust my doctor to give me the appropriate drug and my side effects are no worse than when I take any antibiotic and most of those don't help me.,F,57,10  days1000mg 1X D,1/16/2011,Biaxin xl
58, 3, strep throat,AWFUL BITTER TASTE IN MY MOUTH_ WEIRD THOUGHTS WHILE SLEEPING,I stopped taking this drug after the 5th day even though I was supposed to take it for 10 days.  I had a horrible sore throat and couldn't swallow and it definitely got rid of it in one day but I had weird thoughts at night_ depression and cramps with diarea_ I would never take this drug again.  The worst was the bad taste_ I couldn't brush it away with toothpaste.  I had never taken this drug before as I had usually been prescribed amoxacilin.,M,41,5  days 1X D,4/28/2010,Biaxin xl
59, 1, Sinus Infection,Insomnia (Did not sleep at all for 42 hours)_ anxiety_ paranoia_ auditory & visual hallucinations_ increased blood pressure & heart rate (heart rate nearly doubled)_ heart palpitations_ myalgia (aches & pains)_ headaches_ severe nausea_ dehydration_ abdominal pain_ gas_ metallic taste_ tremors_ and fatigue.,First off_ I should mention that I currently take Remeron as an antidepressant_ and both Clonazepam and Seroquel to control anxiety disorder.I know that a lot of antibiotics cause nausea_ vomiting_ flu like symptom etc._ but what I went through while taking Biaxin XL for only 48 hours was pretty scary. I eventually called health link after being awake for about 36 hours and was told to discontinue using the product. The health link worker then transferred me to a pharmacist who transferred me to Poison Control who suggested I go to the ER. I instead discontinued use of product and began to feel better. Neither my doctor or pharmacist_ nor the people at health link claimed to have ever heard of these types of symptoms_ yet here we are with hundreds of posts by people who have experienced similar symptoms. It felt very similar to being on a stimulant_ such as cocaine or speed_ and Wikipedia (take it for what it's worth) claimed that the drug could even cause false positives for cocaine tests. I was prescribed Biaxin XL 500mg for 10 days_ but discontinued after 48 hrs (4 pills) because of how it was affecting me and because of the advice of the people I spoke with at the time.I don't want to sound like an alarmist_ and from what I have been able to undercover the majority of people do not experience the types of symptoms I_ and others here have listed_ but I do find it alarming that insomnia is not listed as a side effect. Would NOT recommend.,M,25,2  days500 MG 2X D,4/10/2010,Biaxin xl
