0, 5, Eczema,None,I suffer from periodic flare-ups of eczema on my arms and hands. I have patches of red_ angry skin that are very stubborn. After applying Clobex (0.05%)_ you can literally watch the redness dissipate before your eyes! It goes from bright red to what I describe as looking like almost healed bruises. I use this drug concurrently with Locoid Lipocream (0.1%).,M,34,5  days 3X D,4/7/2013Email,Clobex
1, 5, psoriasis,,Awesome product! I had plaque psoriasis over approximately 70% of my body and the only spots I have left are on my elbows. Those are so tiny you can barely see them.,M,37,3  years 2X D,1/1/2011,Clobex
