0, 4, Bv,I didn't experience any side effects with this cream,It always worked very well for me with the bouts of Bv I would get off and on. But my body eventually became so use to the medicine it stopped working so now I'm trying metrogel for the first time.,F,21,7  days,8/1/2015,Cleocin
1, 1, BV,First start using the medication and I'm experiencing severe vaginal itching and burning.not a good sign. But I do hope the medicine works and don't cause harm to my body,Will ask my doctor never to prescribe me such medication again,F,23,3  days100,12/26/2014,Cleocin
2, 2, BV,This is only day one and just after minutes of injecting cleocin I felt intense burning and maybe 15 minutes later aches in my stomach. I really hope its all worth it.,,F,21,1  days,12/19/2014Email,Cleocin
3, 1, BV Infection,HORRIBLE! Stay away from this drug!! My gyno prescribed this for a BV infection that I had. The drug works well but too well. Because the dosage was too high and too long to the point_ it wiped out some good bacteria in my lower GI_ this caused me to have a different infection called C. Diff. Be very cautious when taking this drug_ this drug can definitely cause other infections even if it cures the one you currently have.,C. Diff is a nasty infection. It causes constant diarrhea and is very hard to rid of. It is also CONTAGIOUS! So if you do take Clindamycin_ ensure that you do your best to prevent contracting any other infections from it. Eat lots of yogurt with it!,F,22,7  days300 2X D,7/15/2014,Cleocin
4, 4, bv,Im using the vaginl ovules im on day 2 and so far it seems to be working_ the only thing i have noticed is that i am very fatigued and my body is sore_ not sure if that is caused from the medicine,,F,33,3  days100mg,9/20/2012,Cleocin
5, 3, BV,Nausea_ vaginal discomfort_ vaginal discharge_,Took Cleocin after Flagyl failed to help with BV. My doctor recommended taking Floranex (probiotic) while taking Cleocin to help balance PH. Two weeks later_ still experiencing some stomach upset and burning sensation in vagina. Hate this.,F,32,3  days 1X D,8/4/2012,Cleocin
6, 3, BV,bleeding - is it me or the medicine?,this is the second day of taking it...experiencing light vaginal bleeding_ some nausea_ and lightheadedness. the symptoms arent as bad,F,21,7  days40 g  2% 1X D,7/15/2011Email,Cleocin
7, 1, BV,Neverending white discharge- think it is a terrible yeast infection.  Dr. visit tomorrow.,Horrible to take if prone to yeast infections- I took the Clindesse brand_ but did not find a separate post for that here,F,36,1  days,9/1/2008,Cleocin
8, 4, Cervicitis,I'm not really sure since I'm also taking diflucan with it.  It could possiblby be causing some nausea. Otherwise no other side effects to note.  I have not yet fully completed my treatment.,So far it appears to be working.  Like I said above my Dr. prescribed diflucan to be taken along with it since this drug can cause yeast infections as well. I will be taking the full 7 days_ then terazole and then another 7 days of the cleocin.,F,33,7  days,1/15/2008,Cleocin
9, 1, BV,intense burning...constant milky white discharge....resulted in vulvadynia (a chronic pain condition),I would be very wary of this medication....it has caused terrible damage and I know from others who suffer from vulvadynia that I am not alone in this experience,F,38,3  days,6/26/2007,Cleocin
10, 2, BV,took cleocin vaginal ovules for 3 days. side effects: intense itching after application; much leakage of medicine; loose stools. then_ after all of that_ i'm headed back to the doctor because my vaginal tract itches much worse than before; think it might have caused yeast (it targets all bacteria_ good & bad_ unlike metronidazole--but that's an even scarier medicine for women!),,F,31,3  days,4/30/2007,Cleocin
