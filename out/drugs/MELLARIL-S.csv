0, 1, Stress from abusive spouse,Could not speak_ zombie brain_ uncontrolled facial movements_ inability to play guitar anymore_ felt like I was on LSD.,"I was prescribed Mellaril in the late 90's. I was going through a terrible divorce and the Xanax was not working well. I asked my family doctor for a tranquillizer a bit stronger than Xanax and he prescribed Mellaril (goes by the brand Thioridazine here in Canada). I had no idea that Mellaril was an anti-psychotic. The drug turned me into a complete zombie_ unable to speak. I could only babble incoherently. I developed a condition called ""Tardive Dyskinesia"" from Mellaril that is a permanent_ life altering condition. I have tried just about every drug_ legal and illegal_ and Mellaril was by far the worst drug I have ever taken. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG! It is also known as a ""chemical lobotomy"". I am suing the doctor who prescribed it to me as I was under the impression it was just a stronger version of Xanax. I now have permanent brain damage from this drug.",M,49,6  years100 4X D,11/20/2012Email,Mellaril-s
1, 5, Bipolar 1,Groggy when I woke up.  Impossible to wake up once I went to sleep until 8 hours later. Nasal congestion when mixed with alcohol.  Felt measurably dumber.,This drug saved me.  It allowed me to sleep 8-10 hours per day. It eliminated my mania when prescribed Tegretol and Mellaril.  Switched to Zyprexa which leaves me not so groggy in the morning.  I would recommend it to any rapid-cycler but it takes some getting used to.  Take it all at once at bedtime for best result.,F,48,10  years50 mg 1X D,1/13/2011,Mellaril-s
2, 1, misdiagnosed schizophrenia,Dizziness_ blurred vision_ restlessness_ panic/terror_ unable to control my limbs_ violent headaches_ vivid nightmares_ slurred speech.,The two weeks I was on this drug were the most hellish experience of my life. Be absolutely sure it is schizophrenia before you allow anyone to convince you to take this medication; and even then only if you have tried everything else. Bipolar disorder with psychotic features (what I had) is often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia--there are far better drugs for that.,F,27,14  days,6/6/2009,Mellaril-s
3, 2, Agitated Depression,Wound up with tongue-thrusting_ stiff gait_ akasthesia.  On one occasion_ jaw went into painful spasms-lower right eyetooth was touching upper left eyetooth.,Did very little for the depression.
