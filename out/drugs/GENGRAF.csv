0, 4, atopic dermatitis/eczema,Stomach cramps until I started taking it with milk.  Lower back weakness and knee pain.,This drug has helped me tremendously.  My skin was so bad for months and months. I went to 6 different dermas here in NJ with no help.  I have a bagful of creams_ none of which would help me. Finally someone suggested i go to NYU.  Right away he gave me cyclo.  I started with 250 mg a day_ last month diminished it to 225 and just this week dwindled to 200.  I want to get off this drug only because I hate taking anything with so many side effects for too long.  But_ I am so afraid it will come back again. The worst of it is the dryness and itchiness and redness of my face and eyelids.  It is starting again to get a little itchy_ but maybe because it is winter.  No moisturizer really helps_ even vaseline.  If anyone has any suggestions as to what works on your skin for this condition_ please email.,F,47,4  days,12/31/2007Email,Gengraf
