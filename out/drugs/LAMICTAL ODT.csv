0, 4, Bipolar - Mixed,Very slight dry mouth_ but barely detectable. My fingers are crossed that this doesn't get worse_ as it's a deal breaker for me.  Anyone remember the tricyclics?  I've taken a lot of things to try and improve this hand that I've been dealt_ and nothing has really worked very well_ except androgens .... yeah they work_ but they're expensive.  They say lots of exercise works also_ but getting there is difficult when you're mixed bipolar.  It's a roller coaster.,When I started hearing about treating bipolar patients with anticonvulsants_ I admit I was intrigued_ but I had so many bad prior experiences being a guinea pig_ that I stayed away. Still_ in the back of my mind_ I kept wondering if perhaps bipolar could be a more subtle form of epilepsy.  In other words ... brain damage. So with this idea in mind_ and unable to afford androgens_ I gave Lamictal a try.  What I like about it_ is that it appears to be naturally lifting my mood_ without causing mania_ and so far it's not changing my personality_ which is the whole reason I opted for hormones over SRI's.  As much as I have suffered over the years_ I like being me.  Lamictal also has calmed my racing thoughts_ allowing me to concentrate MUCH better_ but unlike a tranq.  I'm still taking 600 mg Lithium Carb. per day and about 0.5 Xan._ but hoping to cut out one or both of these. So far so good.,M,48,9  days25 mg 1X D,8/19/2010Email,Lamictal odt
1, 3, Free 5 week tiered sample from pdoc,Headaches came on pretty roughly_ even just after 2 days. Keeping an eye out for that damnable rash!,Simple to take_ tastes pretty good haha. Only downside is that I have to keep the pill in the foil pack because they're incredibly sensitive to even slight moisture_ so I can't put them in a pill bottle or in a weekly pill box. It's a 3 because I haven't been taking it long enough yet.,F,21,2  days25mg 1X D,5/21/2010,Lamictal odt
