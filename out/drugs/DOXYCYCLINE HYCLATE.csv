40, 1, Rosacea,This was a year ago that i took this dreaded drug and since then I'm still trying to regain my health. It is a gut destroyer.some people are susceptible to having a reaction from doxy as they may have a sensitive gut. Our bodies serotonin is produced in the gut (feel good hormone). Everything comes from the fur.if the goid bacteria is killed by antibiotics_ it leaves us open to neurotransmitter deficiencies such as head pressure_ nausea_ loss of appetite_ anxiety_ brain fid and those nasty side efects you're feeling. That's what happened to me.i was bed ridden for 2 month after taking a weeks worth of doxy and i didn't know what was wrong with me. It can take a long time to repair the gut after the damage doxy can cause. I was put on antidepressants for 3 months cause i couldn't function at any rate. I had every symptom possible. Its like someone turned the volume up on all my senses_ hearing seemed loud_light sensitivity_ smells were bothering me_ my whole body went out of whack. A year on and I'm still trying to fix myself. I still have brain fog or disconnection feeling_bur I've come a long way. You need to fix your gut!!get probiotics into you_  fix you're diet and exercise. Get the good endorphins in you through exercise. Try to detox your body.  Some recover quick_ others take a long time to find themselves again but preserve_ you'll get there.

I woke up 4 hours later with severe burning in my throat as if the pill were stuck. I drank a bunch of water and still no relief. That day it was hard to swallow because it felt like something was partially blocking my esophagus_ I tried to block out the pain thinking it would go away in a few days. The second day it felt the same way but in a lower region of my esophagus_right smack in the middle of my chest. The third day the pain moved to underneath my left breast_ still when I ate it seemed as if it the food had to pass past something_ and I felt discomfort and pain while it was happening_ then the pain would go away after the food had passed to my stomach. Day 4 I went to the doctor_ there were blood tests done but no look inside of my esophagal endoscopy was performed and the doctor concluded that since my blood work was good he figured it was just a pill that had gotten stuck and would be out within a few days. He considered I eat bigger foods to possibly push it out. I listened to him and its been exactly a week since myast dosage and I am in serious pain.

Just feeling sick and tired all the time.,I've never had an antibiotic like this - its been one of my worst experiences with medications.,F,48,9  days150 MG 1X D,8/9/2015Email,Doxycycline hyclate
60, 2, Sinus infection,Because I got the med late in the day I took my first dose in the evening about 1.5-2 hours after eating my dinner and sat up for about 30 minutes before going to bed (as directed). At 1:45 am I woke up feeling tightness/fullness  in my chest_ rapid heart rate_ and very dry throat and had a full blown panic attack ending up in urgent care and need Xanax to calm down. I was told the Gastro side effects are common and to take with food and be sure to stay seated upright for a couple hours after taking it. Was also told anxiety is not a side effect. The following morning (Tuesday) I was experiencing nausea and other tummy issues_ so I skipped the med that day to get my head and body straight. On Wednesday took the morning dose with plenty of water and ate some food and was upright all day and did not experience any bothersome side effects_ and took my evening dose again with water and food and stayed upright for almost two hours before heading to bed/relax. Well again I woke up with pressure sensation_ felt like my throat was closing up//dryness as well as side pain (felt like intestinal spasms) and anxiety and had another (less severe) panic attack which also required a Xanax to calm down. So_ if you are told anxiety is not a side effect_ read some other posts that are similar to mine. Weirdly the first time I took this for sinus infection I had none of these side effects other than reduced appetite.,Doubt I will take this again if I can help it.,F,44,2  days100 mg,7/23/2015,Doxycycline hyclate

I was constantly nauseous_ had very little appetite_ and some acid reflux.  I was starting to feel a little better from the Lyme_ so like an idiot_ I kept taking it anyway until I finished the bottle (1 month).

I am having a colonoscopy and endoscopy done tomorrow to see what damage doxy did to my stomach.,Has anyone else experienced these severe side effects- even after 3 weeks of stopping the med?

Face started twitching on first night (was worried it was Bell's palsy!!) but because my sinuses were so infected and swollen they had been pressing on nerves and so as the tablets worked I think this is what caused the twitching!! It's worth preserving if you have sinusitis because these are suppose to be the best ones for it. My sinusitus was extreme and I wanted rid so I was prepared to put up with the side effects.

I am military personnel so I stay active ..... impossible on this medication. Unable to run more than a few hundred feet before my head ""swims"" and I give out of energy. I have to fight vomiting for about an hour after each dose. The diarrhea has been constant_ although_ not what I would call ""severe""; maybe_ pudding consistency. I drink fluids_ constantly_ with no relief of thirst or other symptoms of dehydration. With all of this going on_ the worst part is ..... no relief to the infection. Gums are still swollen and sore; Same 3 teeth are loose and protruding forward. I only give this a 2 because I am on the 8th day of 30_ that I will take this.

122, 4, mycobacterium chelonae,Fatigue the first few days - then reflux_ GI tract problems and loss of appetite for several days,I am taking doxycycline along with azithromycin for a lung infection and_ at a minimum_ I will need to remain on medication for a year.  It is extremely important to take probiotics when you're on antibiotics (take two hours BEFORE OR AFTER the antibiotics).  I took the doxycycline with food and also followed all the recommendations -- i.e._ drinking a full glass of water_ not lying down for a while after taking the antibiotics_ etc.).  Despite this_ there were days after starting the doxycycline where I was unusually fatigued_ had reflux and other GI tract problems_ etc. so it takes a while for your body to adjust to this strong antibiotic.  However_ in my case_ this is one of the few antibiotics that can be used with the azithromycin for my  particular condition.,F,62,14  days100 mg. 1X D,1/1/2012,Doxycycline hyclate
123, 5, moderate acne,mild nausea_ alternating increase and lack of appetite_ dizziness_ increased perspiration,I began taking doxy after having endured years of light to moderate to severe (depending on the time of year) acne_ and was simultaneously put on retin-a micro and Yaz to treat the various causes of my acne. I take the doxy with meals_ because despite the bottle directing me to take it on an empty stomach_ my doc told me this would bring about dreadful nausea as the doxy corroded anything around it_ and food would be a barrier between the med and the stomach lining (or wherever it dissolved). I eat it with yoghurt_ as this is supposed to prevent yeast infections_ b/c frankly_ I can do without those. It's been great clearing up my skin_ but has alternating weeks made me so hungry I could eat my hand and so nauseated by food I could toss my cookies at the thought of cookies. So_ my body isn't terribly pleased with my weight fluctuations. Plus_ every time I stand up_ I get very close to blacking out_ literally my sight fogs up with grey and gets spotty with colour as happens when you get that woozy_ and although it has been rather hot here lately_ I seem to sweat more than past summer weather has induced_ and more than most people I see on the street. Despite all these irritating side-effects_ the end result is worth it_ because the perspiration only makes my clear skin glow!,F,20,6  weeks100 mg 2X D,7/26/2011,Doxycycline hyclate
124, 2, Reduce severity of acne infection,Nausea_ extreme anxiety_ depression_ quakes_ profuse sweating_ highly varying blood pressures_ random muscle pains.,The side effects severely outweighed the benefits of taking this drug_ as there are plenty of other equally effective antibiotics available. The depression got bad enough at one point where I had it in my mind that cutting my hand would feel good and that I should drink the blood after I cut my palm open. I'm still scared by these memories today.,M,15,3  weeks100 2X D,6/22/2011,Doxycycline hyclate
125, 3, Prevent infection after HSG test,By the 4th day_ I had a constant feeling that I needed to urinate.   Occasional mild metallic taste in mouth.,Take this with food!

129, 1, Acne,Stomach cramps_extreme nausea_ vomiting_ weak_ itching.,I absolutely hate this drug! Worst thing I could have ever been put on. I started off with the 50mg but since my acne seemed to have come back with a vengeance my doctor increased the dosage. With the increased dosage the side effects came along and what do you know more acne. I need clear skin for my profession but this is ridiculous and the symptoms occur in the worst times leaving me feeling like panicking.,F,22, 100mg 2X D,12/2/2010Email,Doxycycline hyclate

132, 2, UTI (undiagnosed bacteria),brief uncomfortable stomach10 day 100mg twice a day,I've taken multitudes of tests and every test comes back negative.  So doctors haven't found the type of UTI I have.  The low rating doesn't mean I think this is a bad drug for the right type of bacteria_ but it didn't solve whatever bacteria I have.  Unfortunately I have to try another.  The side effects of Doxy are heaven compared to taking cipro...which is my last option if all else fails.,F,29,10  days,1/31/2010,Doxycycline hyclate
