0, 1, Depression,"DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. DO NOT LET A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER TAKE THIS MEDICATION. ONCE YOU ARE ON IT YOU CAN NOT GET OFF IT. I have been on this medication for one reason...I CAN NOT GET OFF THIS!!!! In 1996 after only two weeks of use_ my friend's cat lost my pill bottle. Within 24 hours I was in hardcore WITHDRAWAL. SEVERE (off the charts) anxiety_ insomnia_ crying spells_ dizziness_ nausea_ brain zaps. Went to ER literally begging for this medication. The doctor said ""its impossible for you to have had any therapeutic effect from this dose let alone experiencing 'withdrawal' symptoms.' After two hours the ER doctor finally gave me an RX for this medication to be refilled and within 30 minutes of taking the medication the withdrawal symptoms disappeared. Decades later now PHARMA USA and doctors are now referring to this as ""discontinuance syndrome."" Nice name for HELL ON EARTH WITHDRAWAL. Over the last twenty years I have tried at least 15 times to get off this m",DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. IT IS A ONE WAY TICKET TO ADDICTION AND A WITHDRAWAL THAT IS INCAPACITATING.,F,51,20  years25mg 1X D,8/14/2016Email,Effexor
1, 5, Depression,Nausea for 2 weeks only couple of hours though,After trying 6 different antidepressants over the course of one year. And living the worst year of my life_ I was very reluctant to try it due to the withdrawal symptoms. I was ready to get treatment with ECT. I even had spoken to the doctors and was almost all set to start ECT.  I could not handle the depression anymore. However_I started taking effexor and after two weeks I felt like myself again. I never had depression before in my life. I was very scared to try. I had a very bad experiences with the other anti depressants and after reading so many horror stories about antidepressants I was scared. But like I said_ I am happy to be myself again and my family is glad to have me back. I hope that everyone who gets treatment will have the same experience that I did with Effexor,F,50,3  months37.5,4/28/2016Email,Effexor
2, 3, Depression,I don't recall any bothersome side effects but the drug worked good for about 6 months_ I was happier but tired all the time_ and then it stopped making me happier. I was as if it just kept me from getting angry and aggravated all the time. Nothing was better or good after 6 months but my family doctor thought I should give it more time because I had already tried about a dozen different anti depressants and the same thing kept happening. They stopped working_ some I had to quit within days because of reactions and side effects_ all the others just stopped working after two to six months. The other big reason I rated Effexor at 3 is because I finally went to a psychiatrist for first time in my life and he said I am bipolar and also suffer from PTSD_ so he changed meds and I had to wean off Effexor which took 6 weeks and I had to slowly bump up new meds while tapering off Effexor. This has all been going on now and past 7 weeks. I've been completely off Effexor now for a week but I have,It's horrible if you have to switch off of it. It may be I just had this experience at this level but I'm sure a lot of people have and will suffer to varying degrees if they have to quit Effexor. Ask your doctor lots of questions if they want to put you on Effexor.,M,56,2  years225 MG 1X D,4/4/2016Email,Effexor
3, 1, Depression,Not any help lifting the depression.  Getting off the med. caused MORE depression and added anxiety.,Not only did it not help with the depression but--as others have stated--the withdrawal was HORRIBLE_ worsening the depression.  Psychiatrist who pushed the drug never recommended slowly tapering off as an option.  Went to this web site and others on the internet to seek how to cope with the withdrawals and slowly tapered off.  Will NEVER take this drug again.,F,42,3  weeks 1X D,3/23/2016,Effexor
4, 4, Anxiety/Depression,Extreme lack of appetite_ constant yawning because I feel out of breath_ nausea,Effexor definitely has helped with my anxiety and brought up my mood. The side effects have been generally manageable just find myself having to force food down and definitely don't have enough calories every day. I was slim to begin with but have already lost about 7 pounds due to lack of eating. Just the last few days I've been experiencing extreme nausea and if it persists I will have to get off the drug. I was also constipated for the first few days of taking this but that went away. My eyes still are very dialated though but for me if the nausea goes away the benefits outweigh the side effects.,F,18,7  weeks,3/13/2016,Effexor
5, 1, Anxiety related to health problem,Nausea_ constipation_ jerking_ horrible dreams_ memory loss and brain zaps,I believe my anxiety could have been solved with talking therapy. I have been trying intermittently to get off this drug for some years_ but the withdrawal is too severe. Have cut down to 18 mg a day_ but too scared to cut that the lower the dose_ the worse the side effects. I am just about to ask my doctor to put me on a 10mg Prozac Bridge_ as I have read that this can help with the final stage of getting of it. I think it is a horrendous drug and would dissuade anyone from taking it.,F,47,6  years34 mg,3/2/2016,Effexor

Occasional ""brain shock""/""electric shock"" feelings as though I've missed a dose.","It works for the depression and I'm not entirely sure all of the side-effects are due solely to the medication but I have found that I continue to have all of the above side-effects even after three years of steady treatment (the tremor and nausea are transient).  Although never a good sleeper_ this medication has definitely affected my sleep.  My blood pressure is also raised from baseline (although it was previously low so that is less of a problem).  My white blood cell counts have also been deranged on this medication but although out of normal range have not impacted on my health.  I still get the occasional ""brain shock"" which is odd as I take the tablet at the same time each morning but it is not unbearable.As a medication to treat depression it has kept me alive_ stable_ and functioning (albeit not at the highest level I am capable of) for the last three years.  This SNRI has worked where other SSRIs and NaSSAs and combinations of the two have failed.If considering this medication_ ensure you have a proper discussion with your specialist regarding the discontinuation symptoms associated with coming off this drug as well as the pros and cons of taking it.  Always discuss the various options with your psychiatrist.",F,26,3  years225mg XR 1X D,7/30/2015,Effexor

The  nausea is almost every morning and while I'm forcing food down. I used to exercise everyday_ lift weights_ run for 5 miles but I've lost all my energy during the day. At night I have this burst of energy that keeps me up most of the night. I avoid driving at night since I see light halos that blind me. But other than that Id recommend this to anyone.

I have lost my appetite and if I try to force myself to eat_ I have horrible stomach pain. The weight loss is nice though given that my depression caused me to pack on about 20lbs.,There is no reason to be depressed. There are so many options available to help.

I wrote about my experience wioth that dosage in January. I am following up regarding the 75mg. I experienced the jaw clenching again_ it never went away it just happened less until i upped the dosage. It has started to subside after 30 days. I started feeling nauseous about one month into taking this medication and noticed a severe loss of appetite_ some days I don't eat lunch or dinner. I get nauseous when i try to force myself to eat when I'm not hungry. My migraines are manageable most days with this medication. So far it has helped more then hurt. I will warn you_ I forgot to take my med ONE DAY and all of the initial side effects came back. The nausea_ the jaw clenching_ the constant yawning_ the loss of appetite... and some additional side effects like very vivid dreams and restless sleep.

Friends have commented that I am back to being myself again.

I was also dealing with moderate depression after having breast cancer & having to do a double mastectomy and a preventive hysterectomy. My Dr. Said that Effexor would help with both. 75mg sent me to twirly_ sparkly_ la-la land_ 35mg would ambush me with 1-second long blackouts_ and 18mg just kept me hot all the time_ like having one BIG hot flash all day long!  It also severely compounded my symptoms related to my hysterectomy. My libido has been utterly destroyed! I have learned to put up with the hot flashes during the day and found that 1.25 mg of Ambien puts me under enough that the hot flashes don't wake me up during the night and I don't wake up in a hole in the morning.,F,46,1  yearsall,1/29/2015,Effexor

I have a decreased craving for sugar.,Effexor saved my life! I've been chronically depressed since early childhood_ so I had no personal frame of reference about how other people experience life.

After a while the magic wore off so i tried effexor at 225mg (max dose) but it didn't bring back the initial relief. It took me a week or so to wean off of it.

59, 3, Went through a difficult time,Side effects were dizziness memory loss and fatigue. Withdrawal effects are horrible. There are side effects and withdrawal once you begin and stop taking this medication.   I am 8 days off cold turkey. I have reason for doing it that way. My withdrawal is getting better with each day. This drug was not properly prescribed to me_  after researching for several years and going against doctors orders I did what was right for me. Day 1 -7 are tough but I feel a little more alive with each passing day. I look forward to living a life where my brain doesn't feel like its floating or shivering. My doctor really pushed this drug on me. I'm not going to dwell on that. Please inform and research this drug before taking it as the doctor may not be so helpful or forth coming must be a kick back for them somewhere.

I would give it a 2 on helping with depression but the withdrawals are hell and if you miss taking one while on them_ you can have extreme dizziness. It also made me gain weight. It took several weeks for the dizziness to go away when I quit taking it and I was only on half of a 37.5 mg. The brain zaps are bad too.

Effexor XR seemed more effective than the generic but still much better with the drug than without it. I used to cry at the drop of a hat_ almost very day on the way to or on the way home from work. I rarely feel that way now. I am really shocked that so many people here took it upon themselves to discontinue the meds cold turkey. I was late taking my pill by several hours only once and the side effects were so bad that I made sure I didn't forget again. The brain zapping is hellish.

Within a week of taking it I was contemplating suicide (took a bottle of pills to work just in case I couldn't bear it) and was so paranoid that I was convinced that my wife would turn into a deamon and kill me.  I was hospitalized four times.  Once I got off of all the anti-depression medicines (I now take a mild dose of ativan) I was fine.  It's four years later and I'm fit as a fiddle_ but my effexor experience was awful.,I hesitate to say that nobody should take effexor because I'm not a doctor_ but I do think that the risks are so high_ that it would have to be for someone who is suffering horribly and nothing else is working.

I then increased to 1/2 a tab after one week - VERY slowly. I think it's important to mention this as so many people do not need to be taking such high ""standard"" doses - especially at first. Doctors overprescribe dose and then have to spend months undoing side effects - it's SO much better to start low and work your way up. What do you have to lose? Drugs are never one size fits all_ and lower doses often work best for some. Some people only need 1 motrin for a headache_ some people are drunk after one beer.

I am the type of patient for whom it was developed.  I am also on low Buspar.  I was not interested in replacing Prozac with Effexor_ as I was doing just fine...depression managed for over many years.  But_ I recently developed severe sciatica_ and I have arthritis in one hip.  I am very active and fit at age 61 . The pain was somewhat managed with physical therapy and yoga_ but my doctor said that Effexor had a positive side effect in pain management.  I decided the taste alone was more than I could tolerate.  I stopped 6 days ago_ and went back on Prozac instead.  Yesterday_ I no longer had that horrible taste in my mouth for the first time_ but it still feels dry.  Dropping fluids like crazy and back to normal there.  And_ I am back to my normally healthful eating patterns.  The worst parts of eliminating Effexor are the depression and nightmaresand I mean nightmares.  Nearly non-stop when I sleep. Action-packed and exhausting. I do not recall having these nightmares until I cut out the Effexor.I am accepting of the depression. I know it will go away as I am able to get the Prozac back into my system. I believe I gave the Effexor a fair trial_ but it simply does not match my chemistry.,F,61,3  weeks150 1X D,1/1/2012,Effexor

I was sick of the weight that I'd gained and the acne problems I was having. I have been tepering off Effexor for just over 11 months. I have experienced side effects_ but nothing overly major. After each reduction in my dose the side effects would be on and off for two weeks at the most then go away. Once I was comfortable at the new dose level_ I'd decrease it again.Once I got to the 37.5 mg a day_ the side effects at each reduction have been worse (to reduce 37.5mg_ you need to open the pill and count out the little white balls to create your own dose - a pain in the butt_ but worth it).

106, 5, ,No Libido_ Brain is tranquil.,I started effexor at a very low dose and slowly increased the level from 37.5 to 75 and continued to increase to a comfortable level. I have stopped taking the drug by tapering off as well. I have tried many popular anti-depressants and find Effexor is the best for me. Everytime I stop taking this drug_ I come to the same conclusion-I will need to take this until I find something better. I also take Wellbutrin in combination and highly recommend the combination. I used to love smoking cigarettes. Started smoking at 10 and stopped when I was 31. I went back to smoking for 2 years after not smoking for 8 years. Now I don't like smoking anymore-this is from wellbutrin perhaps. The combination works well for me personally and can easily get off the drug when I decide to. I have stopped at least 3 times. I always come back. My girlfriend is very upset about my lack of sexual drive. Diabetes doesn't help. No erections or ejaculation. It is better than depression and anger.,M,50,10  years150 2X D,2/10/2011Email,Effexor

But I wasn't consistant and eventually crashed and was suicidal so ended up in hospital.

124, 4, depression,sexual side-effects,"I was on Effexor XR for years and it is a wonder drug to get you out of depression as well as stopping anxiety_ and after 2 years of trying other meds I have come back to Effexor XR.  I've read a lot of comments about the withdrawal side effects of missing your medication or from stopping the medication.  This is in part a major reason why I decided to try other drugs because I was frightened by the long term effects of such a powerful drug.  I have experienced the ""brain zaps/surges"" as well and have learned how to avoid them when stopping the medication.  First and foremost_ do not stop this medication without speaking with your doctor.  If you and your doctor decide to take you off the medication you MUST have your doctor prescribe for you a very low dose of an SSRI such as Zoloft to take for a few weeks after in order to allow your body to eliminate the Effexor out of your system without sending it into shock.  You will still experience the head zaps_ but on a very mild scale that are much less intense and a lot less in frequency.

128, 2, GAD,memory loss that worsened over time_ weight gain_ apathy_ night sweats_ lack of focus. SEVERE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS.,This medication seemed like a miracle drug. I have gotten on and off of it 3 times (counting its predecessor Pristiq). After about 2 years the efficacy of the drug seemed to decrease and the side effects became more prominent. Memory loss became worse the longer I took it. It is eventually why I quit. There is always a trade-off with these medications but in my opinion this trade off is not worth it. It is simply not sustainable over a long time_ as your memory degrades it becomes more and more difficult to function normally. I came off the meds VERY slowly but the withdrawals were still a nightmare. Physically and psychologically.

I couldn't function in my day to day life anymore without bursting into tears.  I did not want to see or spend time with anyone-was too exhausting to talk to people and pretend I wasn't feeling as low as I was. The initial effects were difficult but worth it. Changing my dose to the morning and taking it with food helped. When prescribing_ my doc said it would help me 'handle' everyday life & that I would need to work thru my issues with a psychologist b4 coming off drugs. Now I have more strategies & the unusual extreme stress in my life has reduced to a 'normal' amount_ I am ready to start coming off the drug. There's many online comments about how difficult it is to come off - I'm hoping that doing it under advisement of a doc & not cold turkey will make it okay. It is difficult to know if weight gain_ exhaustion & low sex-drive is from Efexor - so will be int. to see what I am like post-efexor... Lately_ am needing to sleep a few hrs in the p.m. & then still can't stay up late...  it's become debilitating.  Also_ I've been yelling in my sleep over the last few months & last night punched my partner during a dream.

132, 4, depersonalization and depression,For the first few years I didn't really notice any side effects but during the last year or so I absolutely lost any and all sexual desire and had extremely reduced sexual functioning on all levels from from desire to sensation to arousal to orgasm.  Also despite anything I've read_ I remain convinced that this medication caused very significant weight gain that I'm still struggling to lose.  Remember results from clinical trials are generally of short duration and say nothing about long term use.,"As I mentioned this drug worked quite well for a long time thus the high rating and when it worked it was a 5 and the best med I'd been on. Then suddenly it began to ""poop out"" and I began suffering from brutal sexual side effects (this was always one area I had complete confidence in so there can be no doubt Effexor was the culprit).  Believe it or not this seemed to coincide with my quitting my habitual pot use and I really wonder whether the pot was acting as an aphrodisiac (which is certainly was for me) and masking the side effect.  This makes it very hard on a relationship and I have yet to fully recover normal sexual functioning. I'm quite concerned about something I have come across called post ssri sexual dysfunction (which means many people do not recover their sexual function for a long time if at all after stopping the med)!! This needs to be studied further.  My advice (and I've been on many of these medications for years and years) is only take these medications if you absolutely have to. I believe they can make profound chemical changes and let's face it_ most doctors don't really have a clue (probably less than I do at this point) about why or how they work and the consequences of their long term usage. I would not need a Pshyciatrist if I could prescribe my own medication.  It's all theory and hit and miss and I am convinced that with the research I've done that my guess is as good as theirs.",M,42,3  years300 1X D,8/4/2010,Effexor

As for long term side effects_ I really only have a few such as low sex drive and foggy memory. Although neither seem to interfere with my life too much.

I haven't been consistently on them for the 8 years but for most of the time- I've come off effexor twice and pristiq once. This medication was a total godsend when I first started it. It gave me self-confidence and fearlessness I never had before; it was WONDERFUL. But it's not suited for long-term use_ and I went back to the way I was before- but worse. I've been off for two months now and I am definitely struggling to get through each day. I used to be an incredibly avid reader before I got on this. I was a great student_ and graduated second in my class. I was in denial of the fact of how badly downhill my mind went on this after years of use because I depended on it so much. Eventually I decided I wanted to be capable of sitting down and reading for more than 15 minutes again_ so I could go to graduate school. My doctor and I tapered very slowly when I came off the medication. That is the best (I'd even say ONLY_ if you want to succeed) way to do it_ but withdrawals are still awful. The physical side effects (INSANE NIGHT SWEATS was the worst for me. I drenched my bed repeatedly) are nothing compared to your mental state. panic attacks abound. I think it's likely the longer you are on it_ and the more you are on_ the worse your withdrawals are.

I wanted to ""feel"" again_ this is day 4 and all I can say is othr than being ""zapped out"" I actually cried yesterday for the first time in 4 months.

(when i tried to get off of it_ i was flooded with emotions so strong i couldnt handle them)i soon found out that i could feel emotions while on the medication only if they were intense enough.  in the end_being so desperate to feel something i commited crimes for the adrenaline rush and fear_ i was arrested_ served time and had a huge debt to pay,,F,23,2  months15 1X D,4/27/2010,Effexor

Taper off. The withdrawal_at least for me_ both times_ was horrible. I heard things_ saw things_ was a nervous paranoid wreck_thought I was losing my mind. I quit Xanax cold turkey twice and it was a cakewalk compared to this stuff. I think experiences like mine are why doctors started tapering people off even anti depressants_ that is dealable.

When I went 2-3 weeks with that mix WITHOUT the effexor my weight shot up like CRAZY. I could not stop eating everything in sight and then when I got it under control the weight wouldn't come off. It's like my appetite was fine when the Effexor was there but when it was gone_ then came the weight. Also_ with the effexor my sex drive was almost non-existant. The 2+ weeks I was off of it my brain went sex-crazy. So BE CAREFULL with this drug.,The one thing I have noticed is that it does manage my anxiety and my appetite_ it does increase my manic episodes.

Then I go back on and boom_ and the weight comes back again.  There is no doubt in my mind that this drug slows down my metabolism.  I'm normally a size 6 and I'm tall so that's pretty thin.  I am a size 10 or 12 on this medication.  It's so frustrating because otherwise it helps me tremendously.

The withdraw symptoms also included violent mood swings_ sweating_ nausea_ and the inability to sleep. I am nervous about what this drug is doing to my body if withdrawing is so difficult.

Intensity of orgasm reduced_ sometimes significantly but don't care  due to emotional numbness.Withdrawal from 37.5mg daily really nasty (missed doses for only 3 days).

I have very strange and vivid dreams.,M,21,2  years,8/21/2009,Effexor
188, 5, depression_ anxiety,originally had been taking the ssri lexapro for about nine days prior to switching to the snri effexor. lexapro made me very lethargic and tired. my brain was in kind of a haze for the first week no lexapro and after switching to effexor i still had that effect but it went away after a couple of days. the first month on effexor was somewhat of a mental rollercoaster. i had few physical side effects_ most notably delayed ejaculation. i experienced suicidal ideation_ depression_ anxiety_ imsonia_ and increased heart rate. blood pressure has been slightly elevated so it's important that you limit caffeine intake and maintain a healthy active lifestyle.  most of these effects subsided dramatically after a month of use. as of now i have no side effects other than slight delayed sexual response (which actually helps to improve my sex life) and imsomnia due to increased energy.,almost immediately after beginning effexor i had much much more energy and have lost a lot of weight because i can exercise more and for longer periods now. that's really amazing to me. the first month is a little shaky but remember the drug takes time to become effective. i now have few side effects and my depression is completely gone. i am much more active_ outgoing_ confident and positive about life. i like what a previous poster said about changing from waiting to die to actually living. the negative thought patterns seem to have ceased entirely. i would have never have thought that life could be so comfortable. i had been suffering needlessly and stubbornly for several years beforehand. don't give up!,M,30,2  months,8/20/2009,Effexor
189, 5, Depression,Brain zaps if dose is missed,I take 75 mg Effexor with 20 mg Lexapro and wouldn't trade it for the world.  This combo helped snap me out of my depression and helps keep me positive_ even keeled and smiling.,F,30,3  months,8/13/2009,Effexor
190, 3, Borderline Personality Disorder,"Tdepression aspect of my illness is no longer there_ and I just feel the ""normal"" ebbs and flows of life_ I thought I would give life a go without it. Its 10 days since cessation of effexor a  I have been very irritable about inconsequential stuff_ nauseated_ metallic taste in my mouth and feel like the inside of my skull is coated in metal shavings that shake with every step I take.  I can't sleep until about 6.00am and then I can't stay in bed past 8.30am. I feel speedy_ sweaty_ shaky and frenetic during the day. I'm getting headaches_ weird dreams and a cotton wool feeling in my head. I'm dizzy and turning my head to look around me is difficult as it makes me feel like I am going to fall over_ it's like it takes a while for my vision/focus to catch up with the position of my head and the direction of my eyes.  I kind of feel like a robot in slo mo - it's highly unpleasant to say the least. I am also having crazy legs and feet that can't bear the feel of blankets or clothi",Initially when I began taking it 75mg a day_ I had the insane_ disturbing epic dreams/nightmares after about 4 months these dreams decreased but I still have one a week (whilst taking effexor. When I was taking effexor the only side only other side effects I'v experienced have been yawning_ hair loss_ greasy hair and weight gain)Sweating that I experienced constantly prior to taking Effexor has decreased to about once a week and only at night_ and my depression is pretty much zero. The decrease in sweats and depression I believe is attributable to considerable lifestyle changes like getting sober_ not taking pain killers_ sleeping more_ enjoying life more_ not being so tough on myself and living rather than waiting to die. Taking Valproate for the BPD side of my mental illness has helped in the reduction of severe highs and lows that used to put me in self destruct/everybody hates me/i'm crazy/i'm the greatest person in the world mode. (I don't intend to stop taking the Valproate ever because it has definitely balanced my moods BUT I do want to minimise the role of chemicals in living my life in a calm way)It was helpful to read everybody else's comments so Thanks & Good Luck in your recovery of good mental health,F,38,9  months,8/6/2009,Effexor
191, 1, Depression,MAJOR WEIGHT GAIN_ it did not make me feel less depressed specifically_ it just made me numb to everything - never felt happy_ sad_ angry_ this drug just put me in a cloud.  Complete loss of sex drive.  The worst side effects are now that I am gradually weaning off this addictive drug.  Side effects from stopping are dizzyness_ nausea_ headaches_ pain from eye movement_ and generally feeling like hell!

She worked in a medical office for years and knew that in some cases it helped with mood and pain.  What a surprise and a relief! I'm taking only half of a 75mg once a day and don't feel I need any more (at least not now?).

And I don't want to belittle that - but one has to realize that people who have bad experiences are far more likely to post their experiences then those for whom Effexor works great! So for a 1000 negative posts_ there might be a million people taking it and be happy. Impossible to know the precise numbers. In my case EFFEXOR SIMPLY CHANGED AND SAVED MY LIFE! This drug is wonderful_ it allows me to be myself again_ be happy and make my family happy. I have been taking it since 2006 and the only ongoing side effect I have is a little bit of dry mouth - and the benefits of taking Effexor far outweigh that.I know sometimes people feel they are not themselves when they take psych drugs_ but in my case I feel that Effexor finally allows me to be the real me again.

I moved 4 hours away_ and the new family Dr. would not re-prescribe without a psychiatric consult.  The shrink refused stating possible interaction with Demerol in an emergency room situation which could spike blood pressure. I said I'd wear a bracelet. He still refused and put me on a series of anti-depressents_ starting with Prozac. Each of them made the fatigue_ inability to concentrate_ brain fog_ and excessive sleepiness worse_ as well as causing loss of libido and inorgasmia. The last_ and by far worst of them was Effexor.  I did not realize that it caused the dizziness (I had to hold onto walls to walk) until I decided to can the shrink. Within 2 days of stopping the Effexor the Vertigo stopped.  The increased fatigue_ etc. took several months to resolve.  The real kicker: Each and every one of those antidepressants caused blood pressure spikes!  I'd like to start an ""Anything but Effexor"" club.  I went to a new doctor who started me on Wellbutrin_ which is an energizing anti-depressant_ and has helped with the fatigue and ""brain fog"" fairly well for the past 9 years.",F,51,4  weeks,5/20/2009Email,Effexor

I tried suicide_ and found that unhelpful_ went dutifully back on the drug after I got out of the hospital. It worked OK for 6 mos_ but not as well as before_ and again I drifted into depression.  I made large lifestyle changes and_ in the process_ quit the drug.  The process was horrible_ but I feel better than I have in years.  Things I had come to accept as growing old (memory loss_ restless leg syndrome_ lack of sex drive) melted away. I feel like a new man.

I have suffered from social anxiety my whole life. At times_ I've been in therapy for it_ but I never considered taking a pill. When I was told it would help with the flashes and night sweats_ I was willing to do anything. A week or so after taking Effexor_ I felt a lot better. I could be in a room with a lot of people and feel comfortable. I could lead a meeting and be comfortable. I could give a presentation and be comfortable.

209, 4, Postpartum anxiety,Constipation_ fatigue_ continuous ringing in ears,Effexor doesnt fix everything_ but helps tremendously.  I've been taking it after each of my two deliveries to treat my panic attacks.  First time_ it worked right away_ second time_ it took a few weeks to be fully effective.  I've always been an anxious person.  My problems started when i feared not being able to fullfill my responsabilities because of my anxiety.  Like not being able to attend a course_ or speak in front of people... and later_ take care of my kids_ or feel well during any activity when it's not the time to feel bad ( you know...).  It would always start the same way :  i feel a strange bodily sensation_ think to myself : oh no_ i'm not going to panic because of this_ then i would try to think about something else_ but would only end up thinking just more about it ... and voila... I'm feeling anxious.   One day_ i listened to Dr Weekes lectures (somewhere on the internet)_ and decided to try facing my problem.  The only way i can avoid feeling anxious is by wanting to be anxious.... treating the sensations like they are invited_ noticing them_ scrutinizing them_ not avoiding them_ wanting them.  It sounds weird but i found it way more effective than effexor.  Since I don't fear my anxiety symptoms_ i almost don't feel them anymore.   Give it a try_  it helps to be on effexor while looking for these answers.,F,31,4  months,4/2/2009,Effexor

I am a therapist and there are many other medications out there that have much les potential for damaging addiction and side effects. If you are using it for reasons other than mental health_ then don't be afraid to push your doctor for focusing on treating the core issue instead of the symptoms_ which I think happens too often nowadays and patients end up more miserable than when they started. Don't be afraid to get second or third opinions_ or to see specialists to get the care and treatment that you need. If you do want to try Effexor_ please make sure you read up on all of the personal stories. There's plenty of info out there. If I had known then what I do now_ then there's no way I would take it or encourage anyone I know to take it. I have spoken to more than one doctor who was COMPLETELY UNAWARE of the side effects_ much less the withdrawal aspect of this drug_ which is scary as hell. One told me that the withdrawal was ""purely psychological""_ which is incredibly condescending and obviously uneducated. This tells me that a lot of doctors are simply not as knowledgable of the medications they are perscribing as we'd like to think they are.

I was initially able to go down to a half a pill with no problems_ but when I cut back to 1/4 of a pill after a week and then tried to go to 1/4 of a pill every other day_ I started to suffer from very distracting ""brain snaps"" [a feeling like an electric current was running through my head].  Very scary. I also felt very ""flu-y.""  My doctor now wants me to stay on the 1/4 pill for at least a month before tapering off to every other day.

The biggest problem I had with Effexor was that it gave me bad insomnia. ADVICE ON HOW TO WITHDRAW: Effexor is difficult to withdraw from because it has a very short half-life. Kind of like cocaine_ your body metabolizes it very quickly and then needs more to re-achieve equilibrium. To offset this_ take Prozac the day after you stop taking the Effexor. I've quit taking Effexor once ""cold-turkey"" and twice with Prozac. There is no comparison. The Effexor withdrawal symptoms with the Prozac were diminished by 2/3 at least. Without Prozac_ the symptoms were pure hell. Prozac has a much longer half-life than Effexor_ so getting off the Prozac once the Effexor withdrawal symptoms have subsided is no problem: Prozac withdrawal symptoms are in the minor leagues compared to those of Effexor.

271, 5, clinical depression,Euphoria,It's a wonder drug.  Over the last 20 years I've taken Elavil_ Zoloft & Wellbutrin for depression and have steadily sunk deeper & deeper into my depression.  I read that the generic Welbutrin I was taking (150mg x 2 daily) tested as being only 30% the brand-name strength_ so I was weaning myself off when my sister got sick with cancer.  I knew I'd need help getting through her illness and asked my doctor for something new.  She prescribed Effexor and it's changed my life for the better.  I've lost 10 lbs_ even though I took Provera for 30 days while on the Effexor.  I have lots of energy and have notice no negative side effects_ except I haven't been able to express my deep sorrow when I lost my sister....but I also didn't sink into despondency when I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  It's a miracle drug.,F,51,3  months,6/11/2008Email,Effexor

I had cut down to 37.5 mg but still had horrible withdrawal which has been described extensively by others.  I know it may take at least a month for these awful side effects to go away_ but my body is telling me to stop taking this drug. Also_ I have stopped taking this by consulting my physician and she is keeping close tabs on my progress.  She suggested taking smaller and less frequent doses but I've gotten this far without it.,I have always wondered why people in other countries are not on antidepressants at the rate in the US. I'm beginning to think it is because we do not know what real problems are and personally_ I'm going to get off my fat ass and begin to exercise regularly_ eat healthy_ and appreciate life and the good things around me.  I do believe there is a thing as clinical depression_ my family has a long history of the disease.  If I get the blues again if my new life style changes does not work_ I will consider anti depressants again but not effexor.

I've always had lots of dreaming so I can't really say Ive had any more than usual but sometimes it feels as if you dream all night that when you wake up you feel like you've never slept. I never had night sweats until Ive taken this drug and it so annoying. I've also had weight gain_ really weird blurry vision and fogginess sometimes and dehydration. If you miss a day when you take it again the symptoms are really crappy. It's like a kick in the pants for missing your dose. You get nauseous and dizzy and just feel completely out of it for about 5 hours or so and your body feels really agitated.,As of right now I would really like to go off of the medication even though I'm really scared of the withdrawal symptoms which I heard that effexor is one of the worst ones.  I do feel though when I decided to first start taking it and until recently it has in general helped me_ definitely with my anxiety and heart palpitations.  With the depression maybe somewhat_ its really hard to say because its so emotional too.  You definitely cant just depend on the medication to make you feel better you have to go the whole 9 yards and do therapy and different self help groups with really does make it easier to learn how to deal with your emotions.  As of now I think Im ready to go off of it because the symptoms seem to be more in the way.  I dont think its a long term drug_ like more than 5 years.  Otherwise you might just go crazy with the side effects.,F,26,4.5  years,1/19/2008Email,Effexor

I can live with most of the symptoms I described_ but...the crazy daily dreams are to a point that they are nightly_ and I feel I am watching movies or I am living a double life.  I cannot even take a nap without having a dream!  Annoying_ bothersome and affects my energy levels during the day.  Scary dreams at times_ but not classed as nightmares,F,49, ,1/13/2008,Effexor

At 6 weeks_ I needed to up the dose because it seemed to stop working. Same thing happened again 6 weeks after the increase and I am faced with the choice of going up again or stopping and going on something else. I have decided to go off it. I am a jeweler and I cannot deal with the tremors_ my hands cannot hold my tools_ and the muscle jerks I get in my arms_ legs_ and jaw are absolutely maddening! The jerks usually come at the end of the day and beginning of day_ probably when the medication is wearing off. Have gained 10 pounds in 4 months because I seem to have lost the instinct or brain message to stop eating when I'm full. I become an eating machine_ stopping only when my jaw starts to ache and i get heartburn. My anger was maintained for awhile but I am back to screaming_ I just don't think this medication is worth the side effects_ plain and simple.,F,41,4  months,1/13/2008,Effexor

I had suffered from extreme depression and anxiety attacks for over 13 years (didn't leave the house for 2 years). I simply didn't want to be alive_ but was not suicidal. After starting the effexor I was able to fly for the first time in years with no fear. Just before I started taking this drug I had lost 2 family members and 5 friends in just over a year and was having a very difficult time with nearly continuous migraines.  I still have headaches often but have only had one serious migraine since I began effexor 15 months ago.

The side effects have been constant throughout but are reasonably manageable. I generally wake around 4am absolutely freezing following a massive night sweat - my bedclothes and hair are soaked. I've found that if I dont get up and take my first 3 pills at around 8am then I get nightmares. Beyond 10 and I get ""stuck"" in nightmares_ where I'm desperately trying to wake up but cant. I've slept through to 5pm until something has finally woken me - really frightening and upsetting. The electric shock head gets much worse as my second dose is due - I think it's just withdrawal. I've noticed that these symptoms are FAR worse if I'm dehydrated. Apart from these side effects_ the drug has worked to improve my long-term depression when other drug treatments have failed.

The withdrawal symptoms are almost unbearable. Although I got through the insane bursts of rage followed by uncontrollable weeping_ the severe hot and cold sweats and the nausea after two or three days_ I can't shake the vertigo_ aching limbs and most importantly the light aversion and things floating in front of my eyes. I have a strong family history of glaucoma_ and was never told that this medicine can cause glaucoma. I am now just hoping that the eye problems are withdrawal and I haven't ended up really damaging my eyes through the fact that no one bothered to monitor my eyes during the 10 years I was on the bloody stuff.

Felt neutral like I was not really experiencing any emotion. Started getting the shakes before taking my pills. Waking up after sleeping for a few hours and eating something sweet and hardly remember doing it. I felt like I was an addict looking for heroin except it was sugar. I am tapering off now going from 150mg/day to zero in a months time. I am on the 137.5mg/day now and feeling foggy and irritable. This was ok for me in the short time but it is time to get off.

Dry mouth. Initial feeling of weight loss during first 2 weeks (was not bothered by hunger_ didn't feel like I wanted to eat). Now quite occupied with food_ eating_ feeding my sweet-tooth_ etc_ even when I'm very full. Like premenstral food-cravings_ but it doesn't let up. Night sweats. Early waking (~5am)_ but can get back to dreaming. Most of the time_ I am able to get out of bed at a reasonable time. A little bit sweaty during the day (but no different to Prozac). Not sure about decreased libido_ because I didn't have one before starting Effexor! Increased pulse rate_ but perfect blood pressure. Sometimes_ I have a subtle feeling of expectation_ like something is going to happen (something exciting_ but you have to wait to find out what it is). It's quite a nice change to the depression.,I'm taking 37.5 mg three times a day now (am increasing dose slowly). Am a bit worried about weight gain_ given my latest food-obsession. Have taken Prozac over the years (starting at 21_ for prolonged periods_ but on and off). Found that Prozac has stopped working. Quickly weaned off Prozac (over a couple of days) and started Effexor. Effexor makes me feel like I have a reason to get up (most mornings_ at least). While it's early days_ I at least have hope that my depression will lift with this med. Not bothered about the withdrawl symptoms when coming off it_ because (a)_ that will be a while away yet_ and (b)_ I seriously need something now_ and quite frankly a couple weeks of shit down the line is better than endless months/years now without taking an antidepressant.,F,27,3  weeks,11/20/2007,Effexor

I was in a very bad way before taking the drug and it was fantastic in getting me on my feet again - I really couldn't have asked for much more and it probably saved my life.However_ after being on the drug for four years and getting to a point where I felt I manage without the drug_ I decided to come off it about 3 months ago. I knew this would be difficult from reading other patients experiences as well as some withdrawal symptoms I'd had after missing a day or so_ but nothing could have prepared me for the awful time I had. The 'electric shocks'_ diarrhea_ nausea_ fatigue_ severe depression along with many other wonderful things. These problems lasted for a week or two_ but now_ three months on I'm still having some issues with anxiety.

344, 5, ,The only negative side effect is that about 36 hours after a 150 mg dose (i.e. if I miss one)_ I begin to experience some dizziness and slight nausea.  On the positive side_ though it has a slight anorgasmic effect_ delaying onset of orgasm and ejaculation_ once it happens it's knee-buckling_ copious and lasts 4 times as long as it used to.  Any effect on libido seems to be positive.,I will continue to use this medication until I discover that I don't need it.  While it is essentially addictive_ the net result for me is a liveable life instead of a constant wresting match with my mood.  My mood disorder was a disabling handicap making it impossible to take pleasure in my life.  Effexor has changed that.  Instead of feeling terrible about life 20 days or more per month_ despite having a productive and interesting life_ it only happens once or twice if at all_ allowing me to be my best.,M,46,9  months,10/31/2007,Effexor

I would have to schedule a day with nothing to do to prepare for the increase in dose because I did not feel that I could function in the outside world.  The only side effect I am experiencing now that my body is used to the medication is restless legs syndrome and anorgasmia.,This is my 2nd time taking effexor_1st time was for around 1.5 yrs.The withdrawal effects u read about are no joke.When withdrawing from effexor_I thought I was losing my mind.I was sick to my stomach.I always had to be w/my family/friends because I would constantly search my house in fear that someone was inside.I am a nurse and come across many pts w/schizophrenia and looking back_the symptoms I was experiencing could definitely compare to that of a schizophrenic.Then there was the uncontrollable crying and extreme suicidal thoughts_along w/the brain zaps in which it feels as if someone literally zapped ur brain and it takes a moment to regain ur train of thought.It sounds crazy that after going through this I would ever take effexor again but after being off of it for around 6 months I once again sank into a major depression_my 4th ever and I have tried nearly every other medication available.I have great results w/ effexor and feel alive again.I do not recommend this medication for,F,25,2  months,10/28/2007,Effexor

It was a great drug to be on_ and I felt stable and myself while I was taking it. Weaning off was fine_ as I followed my doctor's instruction_ and it took approx. 2 months if I remember correctly_ and involved taking Prozac also. It's really important to wean yourself off very slowly_ and with the assistance of Prozac. Similarly_ if I didn't take my pill at the same time everyday_ I would also get shocks. I've just started back on Effexor for hopefully a short period_ but unlike previously_ I'm feeling all the side effects I listed.

I was very hesitant about starting Effexor because SSRIs (Effexor is an SNRI_ similar) always agitate me so badly I cannot take them_ and also because Effexor supposedly increases blood pressure (I have mild_ controlled hypertension)_ and also because withdrawing is reputedly so difficult. But after two weeks on Effexor I was thrilled with the results_ and it got better as time went on and my dosage increased to 150mg/day_ where I will stay. Overall_ I am very pleasantly surprised by the minimal side effects_ the significant benefits_ and the very low cost - I take generic venlafaxine hydrochloride.,M,57,3  months,10/21/2007,Effexor

Nautious at first but subsided after a few days (did take with food).  Dry mouth.  Subtle hissing or ringing in ears.  Increased sweating but not horrible.  Blood pressure higher - heart racing.  Lack of appetite_ especially don't want carbs.  The worst was feeling more and more anti-social the first two weeks to the point that I didn't want to get out of bed and face the world - however it was not clear if this was the depression getting worse or the Effexor making it worse.  Dr. says two weeks is not enough to impact the brain but I honestly feel like the drug did something worse to me.,This was the second time on effexor - the first time was four years ago during a major depression and I felt the drug controlled the depression fine (although felt wired).  However_ this time my depression was milder but seems like the side effects are by far worse and my body was super sensitive this round.  After two+ weeks on 37.5/daily_ I never really felt any relief from the depression and in fact feel worse off - so am going to stop.

But recently (now that I have been feeling 'normal' about life for years thanks to effexor) I am noticing side effects. At first I thought all these side effects were seperate issues. It never occured to me they could be from my precious effexor. I looked up Acne and Effexor on Google and it led me to this page and others. After reading other people's experiences I realize that my time with Effexor should be up (well it probably should have stopped 2 years ago). The side effects have outweighed the benefits and it's time for a change (hopefully no medication but we'll see how that goes!) I sure am glad I got one Effexor when I did!

Their effectiveness was wearing off so we tried a couple of others: Cymbalta_ Wellibutrin and Lexapro.  Their side effects (for me) were too bad to be worth any benefit they could hope to offer.  But Effexor has been FABULOUS.  I no longer eat for comfort.  If Im full  I stop eating.  I dont feel overwhelmed and I feel at peace which is a new and strange feeling  but wonderful J.

Then I suck it up and get back to work fixing the house. At night_ If I do get some sleep_ the dreams leave me feeling overwhelmed with anxiety which I attempt to hide so my kids dont feel their dad is doing a Captain Queeg. I dont feel that the benefit of Effexor_ is worth the downside.

I was unable to do anything for myself - depression ensued.  For the 1st time in my life_ I saw a therapist & psych who tried a few other drugs that didn't work.  As the weeks wore on_ I saw a little improvement_ but not much.  In May_ I started effexor.  When I took the first pill_ my body totally relaxed for the first time since february.  Even with the effexor_ it took me months to get well.I ended up at 375 mg_ which I still take today_ 10 yrs later.  I think I had always needed something to make my brain right.  I still feel_ get sad_ nervous_ excited - but all at more normal amounts.  I NEVER miss a dose.  I have started worrying about extremely long term effects since it looks like I will take effexor for the rest of my life.  I never even wanted,F,42,10  years,6/25/2006Email,Effexor
540, 4, anxiety/depression,The first day_ I felt really loopy; like my head was floating above my shoulders (thank God I started on a weekend). This has pretty much stopped_ but I feel tired in the afternoons. Weight loss (not very hungry at all)_ dry mouth_ slight tingling feeling in fingers the first few days. Eyelids felt heavy (also lessened). This is the first anti-depressant I have ever taken so the side effects may have been worse on me. Feel a little weak from time to time. I can also get really spacey from time to time.,I don't get as depressed. I feel better and more normal. I have only had depression the past 6 months and it was terrible. My anxiety has lessened_ as well. I don't have the normal enthusiasm that I am used to_ but I feel like this is slowly getting better too.,F,27,14  days,6/22/2006,Effexor

Thought I might actually have a heart attack at age 27!",Start it slooooow and watch for side effects.  Probably like any other drug it can work for some people.

Effexor was no better than Zoloft and had the added side effect of agitation.  Trying to wean off of Effexor was a NIGHTMARE!  I had pain all over my body and suicidal thoughts_ for the first time in my life.  The daily withdrawl was worse than any panic attack.  It took more than 4 months to completely get off of this drug.  A more serious warning of the withdrawl symptoms needs to be made.,F,43,6  months,6/17/2006,Effexor

My blood pressure has increased A BIT but tends to be low so my doctor simply wants to keep an eye on it.,I seem to have settled comfortable in 75 mg per day. The world is a kinder_ gentler place now. My husband and children noticed an immediate change in me - for the better. I like the person who I am again. I'm not suicidal or so down in the dumps that I cannot go to work_ function_ etc. I think that my hormones have got the best of me and I haven't been myself for several years.

Of course my wife_ makes that all her fault that she can't please me and not due to the medication.  After being on Effexor for 3 years I tappered off over the past week.  I can orgasm now in 3 seconds or 3 minutes_ but my anxiety has returned some and I feel frequent ""tingling"" sensations_ itching and have had cold/flu like symptoms.

I ended up Lithium for about 9 months (which I stopped because of the side effects)_ and after that_ he put me on Wellbutrin (again_ side effects made it impossible to continue).  He then prescribed yet ANOTHER drug that I never started taking.  I'm trying to get off the Effexor but the side effects are so horrible when I lower my dose.

Although I originally took it for anxiety attacks what it really did was quiet my obsessive-compulsive thoughts. I developed an I don't care attitude   but not to the point that I would walk out in traffic or such. I could stop an unfinished job and take a break or leave work on time without feeling guilty if something wasn't finished. Dreams are so vivid I'd wonder all day if they were real or not. Missing a daily dose can lead to brain shocks_ headache or a deep feeling to sleep. Dentist bills are up due to gringing teeth. Weigh gain has been continuous and a real sore point. With all these negatives I still take it because the freedom from obsessive thoughs and the anxiety they caused is worth it to me.,M,54,3  years,5/21/2006Email,Effexor

It has really helped relieve my anxiety and depression.  I am not done yet_ and I don't know what the end milligram will be for me_ but Effexor has worked better for me than anything else.  I was on Lexapro_ have taken Celexa and others in the past_ but this seems to be helping me better than the others.  I am willing to stay with this and see what happens.  I plan to follow my doctors instructions_ eat right_ exercise and try to get my life back on track.

Now I have no side effects at all besides vivid dreams,Only been on it for a week and made a tremendous difference.  Before I wouldn't sleep at night worrying about my life and had suicidal thoughts.  I've had anxiety disorder since I was 5 or 6 years old and with Effexor I've never felt this confidence in my life.  Before when I was put into uncomfortable situations I would lock up_ get hot flashes_ and was so nervous I couldn't talk.  These were probably 20 times a day.  Now I'm clear headed and have no problem coming up with a solution. My girlfriend notices that I'm in a good overall mood and not trying to avoid everything.  My depression (which I think is caused by anxiety) has gone away totally.  And my phobia has lessened drastically to the point where I can function around what I was scared of.  I can sleep through the night besides only a few crazy dreams the pull me out of a sleep_ but I fall right back asleep.  I was never able to eat breakfast until now either.,M,29,1  weeks,5/14/2006,Effexor

Within 2 weeks of starting I didn't feel any better until Dr got more aggressive and raise my dosage.  At 3 months_ I was feeling like my old self. (375mg daily E-XR) After 3 years of use I weaned myself off over a 6 month period of time. (had missed some doses and felt poorly_ sleepy and my brain actually felt heavier and I ""felt"" blah).  For almost 6 months I was doing great - then I had a relapse (anxiety) following a loss of job_ then move from the city life to the country and restarted after suffering for another 2 months.  Have been on XR (for the 2nd time) for 23 months feeling great.  ",Effexor XR has definately helped me get my thoughts together_ feel like my old self_ become sussessful again in (sales).  My body and mind have adjusted (finally) and my only issues are self-imposed.  In the future I may again try to wean myself off but first plan to lower dossage from 375mg to 300mg to save $25/month.  For those beginning to use Effexor XR_ one should begin to feel better within 2 weeks - otherwise an increase may be warranted.  By all means_ communicate with your Dr.  Try not to miss a dose as you will fell like a slug the day after.  If you feel good - keep taking the med.  It is ok to take meds to feel right again.  Even the strongest willed person I know couldn't successfully overcome depression alone.  Exercise is a must and vitamin b12 has helped.  Don't give up - never give in.

I worry if there were a natural disaster or man-made disaster and I couldn't get my meds_ if I would be able to cope.  I really don't think I would.  I hate that feeling.

586, 4, Depression/Anxiety/Weepiness,Extreme gassiness.  Constipation.  Mild dry mouth. Constant tummy ache.  Fatigue_ apathy.,I have rapid mood swings and feel down much of the time.  In the short time I have taken this drug_ I have noticed that I am no longer weeping all the time.   I used to get very sad and was experiencing overly negative thoughts.  Now_ even negative thougts or news don't really bother me at all. I don't feel depressed or anxious!  I don't feel happy either but I guess that may take a while to show up.  I have tried many different drugs including zoloft_ celexa_ prozac_ wellbutrin_ lithium_ lamictal and have been misdiagnosed several times.  The problem with me_ is that the drugs work well for the first week or so then all of the old symptoms come back.  So_ I'm not sure this is the drug for me but it's my last try before being put on A-typical anti-psychotics to try to control mood swings.  Doc tries to play down the original use of the drugs saying they've found they are effective for depression and axiety.,F,42,9  days,2/17/2006,Effexor

The night sweats (having to change clothes in the middle of night because it was so bad) became embarrassing.  I started jerking and kicking in my sleep to the point where i would wake myself up.  Coming off the effexor was even worse.,When I decided to come off the effexor_ i reduced the amount I was taking much slower than the doctor recommended.  However_ the dizziness and what they call brain tremors (severe and shocking periods of imbalance or dizzy spells) were so bad i would never go back on it or recommend it to anyone.  it took about 4 or 5 months to completely get rid of the withdrawals.  the withdrawals do go away_ but the tradeoff is not worth it.  i would NOT recommend it to anyone.

Unfortunately it has taken away the ability to climax. Doctor states side effects go down with increased dosage. Doubtful. I was having problems sleeping.

Don't want to run out of this stuff! I've tried lexapro which helped a little_ wellbutrin and I got hives_ and zoloft stopped working for me after a year.,F,41,2  months,10/16/2005,Effexor

631, 4, depression/anxiety,Side effects were minimal; occasional dry mouth_ headache_ weird dreams. Overall_ nothing significant.,"Withdrawing from Effexor has been difficult. Fortunately_ because I've withdrawn from Paxil and Zoloft in the past_ I knew what was happening to me. The most prominent withdrawal symptom was the feeling of electric jolts going through my extremities_ particularly my arms and fingers and occasionally_ my lips_ and of course_ the notorious ""brain shivers""_ anxiety_ and dizzziness. On the worst day I felt as though I were going to vomit and would break out in cold sweats. I spent two weeks taking one capsule every other day until I ran out. The first three days without Effexor was the most trying_ but each day became a little better than the one before.",M,50,1.5  years,10/15/2005,Effexor

Sleep problems are alleviated somewhat if I take the medicine in the morning; otherwise_ I'll go to bed and wake up feeling like I hadn't slept at all.,The side effects_ though no fun to live with_ are a price I'm glad to pay for being able to live a normal life. I'm tired most of the time_ but that's much better than depressed. When something goes wrong_ I don't break out in tears and I feel like I can handle it. I take 150 mg_ and am a fairly small person. An earlier drug_ Lexipro_ was no help at all.,F,24,2  years,10/9/2005,Effexor
634, 5, Depression,Effexor worked very well for me_ although I did have some weight gain. My issue though is going off of it. I lowered my  dose for up to six weeks. It's been a little over two weeks off the drug and I am in such a bad mood: very impatient_ still tired and overall cranky. Not sure if this will pass_ I really want it to. Has anyone had this happen to them?  Thanx.,Effexor worked very well for me. Helped me control my emotions. Some weight gain and very tired though.,F,38,4  years,10/7/2005,Effexor
635, 1, Depression,This drug did help my depression.  At first my mouth and nose were so dry-my nose was actually painful with breathing.  After a loading dose my dose was 300 mg a day. I experienced two years of chronic constipation-developing hemmorhoids as a result_ dry mouth (which improved over time) and a painfully dry nose. Ive developed scabs in my nose that would not go away; when I touch them I get a pain going down the inner front side of my neck and into my ear.  My nose bleeds almost daily. I went from all my life needing 8 hours of sleep to getting by with 2-4 hours.  I was wide awake until 2-3 AM every night.  After two years_ finally I came to the conclusion this drug was the primary reason for causing so many problems was having: I just wanted to sit around and do nothing-then felt depressed because I never got aythng accomplished.  As a result of being so sedentary I have lost so much flexibility and have gained 20 pounds.  I got to the point I couldn't exercise at all-even walki,Withdraw was just horrible and lasted a little longer than a week.  I tapered down easily from 300 mg to 75 mg and then to 1/2 a capsule per day which I took every other day for a short while and then just stopped. I did this without my doctor.  I dont even know how to describe physical sensations and rushing noises in my head.  I also had sudden episodes of dizziness_ clamminess alternating with sweats_ feeling cold and feeling like I had a fever.  I startled (jumped) at noises_ had difficulty with bright light_ actual unsteadiness_ some body aching_ terrible tiredness. My concentration was very difficult_ I couldnt come up with words I wanted to say_ I had instant forgetfulness-when talking_ I would cry and become so emotinal just instantly over anything that was touching. I felt itchy.  I couldn't sleep well.  I did not have nausea or vomiting.,F,57,2  days,10/7/2005,Effexor

It worked great in many ways. It allowed me to handle life again. It made me feel normal again. I felt able to feel a range of emotions without the extremes. Yet_ as time went on_ I began to have more sluggish thinking that was getting in the way of my effectiveness at work. Bummer! There were enough negatives piling up that I moved to Lexapro for a few months and now am weaning myself off of everything.

Decided to get off of it because of weight gain_ high blood pressure_ and lethargic blahs.  At 49_ I played soccer two to three times a week until the last 6 months.  No drive to get back.  I've never been a drug user/abuser.  But now I know_ even by the littlest of margins_ what withdrawal does to someone.  How can something that so many people on the net have had negative effects that have hampered their lives_ be FDA approved and fit for humans.

692, 4, Major Depression,Tight jaw at night when trying to fall asleep_ WEIRD and I mean really weird dreams (and vivid too) not necessarily bad dreams but sometimes they're bad.  If I miss a dose the dreams get bad. Night sweats.  I wake up in the middle of the night and have to tear my clothes off because I have completely soaked them in sweat.  Dry mouth alot of the time but it's ok b/c I get my recommended water intake for the day.  I also get these weird twitches.  Also very occationally_ with these 'twitches' I get this electrical sensation (with a shooting light when my eyes are closed)with a noise that sounds like a laser gun from a cartoon.,Despite this long list of side effects_ I like effexor. It seems to work differently than the paxil or prozac that i've been on in the past. It doesn't make me numb like the others. Prozac made me completely unable to cry. My best friend could have died and I would not have cried. I didn't like that. It also allows me to have a sex life. My drive isn't as high as when I'm not on anything but it is much better than having no drive at all like I did on the other drugs.  I missed taking it for 1 1/2 days and I wound up puking my guts out and had the most horrible headache I have ever had in my life.  My head was throbbing.  I'm not looking forward to getting off of this when I'm ready. It's gonna be hell.I did hear that taking Prozac while getting off of effexor makes it easier (something to do w/ the half-life of prozac) and I don't think prozac has withdrawal symptoms for most people.,F,24,12  months,4/4/2005Email,Effexor

The night sweats are incredible. Didn't know anyone could sweat like this. Some weight gain. I worry about the tingling / shakes which were the same symptoms of GAD with which I was diagnosed. It is infrequent and happens when I haven't eaten for several hours. Helps to snack. It's not the sugar low or not having eaten feeling that you'd normally expect. This is like Parkinsons disease! I am on 225 dosage now. 150 in the morning and 75 at noon as the whole dose in the morning was wearing off by early afternoon.

I didn't feel the need to abuse alcohol (or speed) ever again. I WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THOSE HORRIBLE SIDE AFFECTS AGAIN IF I HAD TO. This drug saved my life.

Side effects haven't been too severe for me_ and mostly happen for a few days after I change dosage level_ or when I miss a dose. Overall it has worked very well for me_ made it a lot easier to function normally day to day. But easing off it needs to be done SLOWLY_ it can be really awful if done suddenly (went cold turkey from just 75mg/day and I had AWFUL nightmares for days_ felt trapped and couldn't wake up etc.),M,23,9  months,2/20/2005,Effexor

My urine is also very stinky (and I don't have an infection)!!  I'm wondering if anyone ever had that???,I'm kind of tired looking on some of those pages about all of the bad stuff about anti-depressants.  If it weren't for Paxil and then Effexor_ I would not be enjoying my life the way I am.  Many side effects I read on those crazy pages are depression symptoms_ which means their medication or dosage isn't working! I had plenty of those symptoms PRIOR to going on the drugs.  I now have a wonderful outlook on my life and do not wake up in the middle of the night anymore thinking of some terminal disease I'm convinced I have.

Then I realized that I am not experiencing bad side effects like these people are and have not experienced the withdrawal symptoms.  Effexor is not right for everyone and finding the right medicine for you is sometimes a trial and error run.  I feel great now that I have started taking Effexor.

It's discouraging how unique people's reactions to drugs seem to be. For me_ Wellbutrin made me borderline psychotic. Others did nothing. Anyway_ about Effexor: It's made me very mellow - had the greatest impact on anxiety - but I still seem low energy. Not really sad but detatched. Side effects have been mild_ except that I have almost no sex drive (plus some sleepiness and slight vision blur). Other drugs impacted sexual functioning but Effexor has more to do with my actual interest. It actually doesn't distress me directly but indirectly through my wife. I'm going to look into a lower dose.,M,35,1  years,1/31/2005,Effexor
720, 1, Depression,I gave up on Effexor recently only after 11 days. I did not have any problems nor notice any effect whatsoever in my first 7 days at 37.5 mg. Only one weird incident_ on night 5_ I woke up with my right arm pointed toward the ceiling for some weird reason. I was most worried about what any kind of drug would do to my sex life and sure enough_ on day 11_ as it was strange--though I had no problem being aroused_ I lost libido or the want of having sex--and that ain't gonna happen to me. I'd rather live with my so-called depressed stae condition than be even more depressed. Because of this side effect alone - I quit effexor xr.  I told the Doctor_ if this effects me in any way_ shape_ or form regarding sex..I quit. Nothing more depressing than not wanting nooky. End of story.

723, 1, anxiety and depression,After I taking my first dose of Effexor xr; the very nest day I started getting dizzy when I stood up or even moved my head and I had trouble breathing; it was like my diaphram no longer worked. After a while I noticed that I was getting more and more out of breath_ I couldn't walk from one end of my apartment to the other without being completely out of breath_ I also noticed that my heart didn't speed up when I was exerting myself. I eventually began passing out and having what my parents thought were seizures. I finally saw the doctor and he had me wear a Holter monitor for 24 hours_ he told me after the 24 hours_ that I would get the results in about a week. However_ my doctor called me the next day and said I needed to have a pacemaker implanted RIGHT NOW or I could die. My heart was beating only 35 times a minute and the top of the heart was not giving the bottom part of my heart the signal to beat.

Overall_ felt it improved my focus and made me less zombie-like feeling_ but that seemed to backfire. The effexor made me more alert and more mentally stimulated_ but didn't improve my mood at all.  Which left me feeling not tired_ wide awake with no spirit and no ability to actually carry any tasks out... And that made extremely irritable and frustrated_ and made me very distraught.

743, 4, depression suicidal,increased sweating_ vivid dreams_ no sex drive_ loss of desire to smoke_ intense!! fatigue at first but gets better_ nausea_,The side effects can be many_ not just a few_ but it works for me!! The withdrawals are very difficult_ I stay home and smoke pot for a week whenever I start/ stop this medication. Would be dead now if not for effexor xr. All things are worse at higher doses_ use the lowest dose that works and then later try taking it lower if you can. I was started on 150 because of such severe depression_ could have slipped and killed myself at any moment... now take 75 and it works just fine without making me too complacent. I would live on it if not for the loss of sex drive_ as is I go back on it for several weeks when true depression returns ( uncontollable crying_ suicidal thoughts)_ so far have gone back on 3x in the last two years.,F,27,2  years,11/23/2004,Effexor
744, 3, Anxiety that lead to depression,I first started taking effexor about 5 years ago. I took it for about 21/2 years and I never really noticed any side-effects except for a loss in my sex drive and lack of emotions. I finally decided to get off this drug and it was extremely difficult. I wound up going to Celexa for a about a year and a half until I finally got off that.Now_ In Nov 2004_ I went through another anxiety stage and wanted to be put back in Effexor. I've been taking 37.5 for 5 days and feel like hell. I've become more depressed on the drug then before. I can't sleep at night and feel like hell during the day. I've decided that I'm going to try and live my life on no drugs bc then you just become dependent on something. Us people with anxiety know that anything you put in your head stays.,Effexor isn't for everybody. It's like any other drug_ might be the best thing for one person and hell for another. It worked for me the first time but not the second.Anybody who has anxiety and would like to speak_ I'd be more then willing to listen (modiggity03@yahoo.com),M,24,2.5  years,11/23/2004,Effexor

One shock every few seconds.  Other people have described this strange side effect also_ but doctors just write it off and call it,The withdrawals are worse than heroin withdrawals.

I have gained considerable weight on Effexor_ and seem unable to shed weight despite periodic loss of appetite. I have incredibly vivid and sometimes exhausting dreams_ trouble falling a sleep 3-4 times per week.

Antidepressants have all increased my libido and sexual pleasure but delay the orgasm (which is ok).

Currently withdrawing myself slowly_ with increasingly smaller doses. Currently down from 225 mg/day to 112.5 mg/day. Effexor was more effective than other drug in treating my depression with suicidal thought and panic_ but not anxiety. It did not have the emotionally flattening effect of Prozac_ which is good. However_ I have felt physically ill the entire time I've been on it -- and in fact did have breast cancer during this period. But the physical symptoms/effects are very disturbing -- weakness_ nausea on exertion_ sweating_ constant fatigue_ inability to complete tasks_ slowness_ lack of clarity_ extraordinary weight gain.

My symptoms were high anxiety_ uncontrollable moods & inability to think clearly. After a week or two there was a significant improvement - back to my old self. I started on a high dose (300mg) and am now down to 150mg daily. If I miss a dose I feel shaky and anxious_ but take a half dose to get rid of these side effects and continue with my regular dosage the next day. I have had mild side effects but they're a small price to pay for control over my depression and life. The people I socialise & work with wouldn't know I regularly take meds to combat depression unless I decided to tell them.

But when my OCD progressed to intrusive thoughts_ I knew I had to do something right away.  In the last few months the intrusive thoughts have almost gone away (I feel them trying to sneak in but they are much easier to squash)_ however my OCD seems to be going backwards and I am back in to the checking ritual_ which is WAY better than the intrusive thoughts. I am only up to 112.50 right now and I know I will have to reach 200 before I see a great difference_ but overall_ this drug has taken my worry level from a 10 down to about a 2.5 which is worth everything to me.

Wondering if anyone else has experienced this_ I have no family history of tremor.....thanks,,F,42,9  years,12/19/2002,Effexor

863, 3, to combat hot flashes,No problem while taking the medication but withdrawal symtoms included a light headed feeling like a heavy sugar buzz and trouble sleeping.,Effexor was prescribed after a mastectomy and chemo treatments that pushed me into menopause.  Effexor was suppose to help with hot flashes but I could never tell if made a difference.  It did help with mood swings but I don't feel like the benefit outweighs the withdrawal symptoms.,F,48,5  months,10/21/2002,Effexor
864, 2, Depression & Anxiety,Major sexual side effects from this med and all depression medications taken. Problems range from weaker than normal erection to lack of sexual desire which is hard explaining to my wife. Furthermore_ it certainly appears I have gained 15-20 lbs within a year of taking this med. Once you realize this crap is making shit worse_ it is a bitch to quit!!! MAJOR WITHDRAWAL problems including anxiety worse than ever before_ easy to agitate_ diarreha. It basically feels like a terrible hangover from one night of heavy partying.,I wish I would have never gotten started on this or Celexa.,M,31,1  years,10/3/2002Email,Effexor

887, 5, clinical depression,My doctor had originally prescribed Nortriptyline which usually had undependable and uncomfortable side effects and never really seemed to work well.  About three years ago I had made a 300 mile trip to visit my mother and felt very drained and fatigued when I arrived.  I was out of my medication and could not seem to shake the fatigue no matter what I tried.  I explained this to my mother who knew I was on Nortriptyline and offered me a 75mg Effexor tablet.  It turns out_ many of my family members also suffer from clinical depression.  The effects amazed me.  Initially I had a very sick feeling in my stomach that lasted about 5 or 10 minutes.  After about 20 minutes I just seemed to come back to life and the fatigue was gone.  I had been fighting this kind of fatigue and irritibility for almost 10 years before I was diagnosed with depression.  Additional side effects I had had was alot of muscle quivering all over my body.  Nothing serious and strangely it felt very good to have sensation where normally I had been physically insensitive.  When I returned home I aksed my doctor to change my prescription to Effexor.  These effects only lasted about the first few weeks I taking Effexor and the good effects have been pretty dependable.  I adjusted the dose to about 4-5 65mg tablets per day.,Taking Effexor with or without food seems to make no difference at all.  However_ my nervous system has adjusted to the medication over time. This accounts for some rather difficult withdrawal symptoms of I stop taking it or miss a day or more of regular doses.  These effects include extreme irritibility since I had no longer needed to psychologically cope with many of the extreme effects of clinical depression as I had for over 10 years_ these resistances were not as well honed as they used to be.  This withdrawal effect has been the worst of them.  Another withdrawal effect are flashes of numbness and tingling_ mostly in the hands and a similar sensation or dizziness in the head.  Finally_ over a period of time I noticed I had to adjust to higher doses currently at 4-5 75mg tablets a day and the time it takes for the medication to begin working noticeably has increased somewhat from 20 minutes to about 45 minutes to 1 hour.After taking effect_ there is a peak where the medication is working very well for about 20 minutes and drops off again_ quickly at first then gradually over about 4 hours.  If I miss a day of medication_ I need to limit my first dose to about 1 half or one tablet as more than this will cause some almost convulsive nervous sensation and a strong need for rest in order to re-adjust.,M,35,2  years,10/14/2001,Effexor
