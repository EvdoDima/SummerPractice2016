After reading reviews online I became worried and starting thinking my itchy scalp_ aches and pains were all due to the side effects. 4 days in and the worse thing is really just the strong after taste it leaves in your mouth and the effect this has on apetitie,This medicine works but Zithromax has less side effects and is not as strong. I was possibly prescribed this stronger antibiotic because I also had asthma and the doc didnt want to take any chances.

I also found that all other drugs that have the same mechanism for action as fluoroquinolones ? topoisomerase interrupters (FDA warning label_ 7) (topoisomerases are necessary for proper DNA replication) ? are used as Chemotherapy drugs ? topotecan_ amsacrine_ etoposide_ etc.  Fluoroquinolones are_ truly_ chemotherapy drugs ? they just happen to be used as popular antibiotics.

46, 1, atypical lung infection,I was ready to take this medication when I thought to read the pamphlet.  Realised this was a quinolone and took it back into the store.  Had taken Levaquin four years ago and ended up in the ER with sleep deprivation_ anxiety_ paranoia_ shaking_  and basically feeling like I was on some type of nightmare trip but was fully awake.  At the ER the Dr.called for a psych referral but a nurse noted that it seemed related to the levaquin effects she had seen previously in a few patients.  The entire class of quinalones_ I.e. cipro_ levaquin_ avelox_ and a couple others are in my medical file as meds I'm allergic to.  However_ the Dr had called in rx after hours without looking at my chart.  I had never thought to let my pharmacy know of the allergy so they filled this rx of avelox.  Lesson learned:  quinalones can be dangerous_ read all info before you take any meds_  let your pharmacist know any allergies_ and ask Dr.or office staff if your file will be checked before phoning in meds.  If I would have taken this rx today I'm sure I would have had the same or worse reaction than with the levaquin.

53, 1, Infection,Had a severe allergy against this drug. Within thirty minutes I turned bright red_ and my stomache felt like I had acid poured into it- severe discomfort. Threw up everything including what was left of the drug in my stomache.  I took three benyadryl and anti-acids to make the drug ineffective as pssible. 30 minutes later I had severe itching like I was sitting in an ant bed_ and developed welps. Now a few days have passed and my skin_ and the palms of my hands itch constantly. I even broke out as well on my face_ and my muscles have been sore for days now.

I did not feel like myself at all! Stopped taking it on day 3 and got my doctor to prescribe me something else. He asked me to try and bear through the side effects and take 2 more doses. I told him there was no way I would jeopordize my health and well being any further.
