0, 1, Sciatic pain/spasms,Took 1 3 hrs before bedtime_ took another @ bedtime. Woke up with extreme headache_ dry eyes_ dehydrated.,Cannot tell yet if it is helping the spasms_ because they seem to happen at random times_ but needed to sleep last night so made sure I took a couple of doses to try to assure not having them then. Did not experience any spasms. Will update in a couple of weeks since the following week starting tomorrow will be filled with extreme activity for me. I do recommend vigilant hydration while on it thus far though.,F,40,1  days 3X D,2/13/2010Email,Methocarbamol
