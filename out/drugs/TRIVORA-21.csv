2, 3, Regulate period/ contraceptive,Monthly yeast infections before my period and mood swings. I was on cryselle for 2 years prior and loved it. My doctor switched me to Trivora and I suddenly had many yeast infections. Finally switched back to a monophasic_ azurette_ hopefully better luck with it.,,F,20,1  years,4/25/2014,Trivora-21
3, 2, To clear up acne,Extreme weight gain_ bloating_ mood swings_ increased acne around period_ shorter but heavier period_ growth in breasts_ sore/tenderness in breasts.,I'm thinking about coming off of Trivora because it has made me gain 20+ pounds in the past 8 months that I have been taking it. Also I still have my acne_ not as severe as before but its still there. Trivora also made my breasts increase_ I am already big breasted and now they are even bigger_ which causes many problems for me since I am an athlete. Trivora also has shortened my period which used to be light from 8 days to 3-4 days_ and it has become very very very heavy. I usually used to have terrible migraines with my period before Trivora_ but ever since taking Trivora I haven't really experienced them as horribly as before. Overall I am pretty sure I am going to be coming off of Trivora.,F,16,8  months 1X D,8/1/2013,Trivora-21
4, 5, to prevent pregnancy,I love this birth control. I have been taking it since last march and it works perfectly. I have regularly periods_ cramps only last 1 day maybe the half of day 2. I've always had crazy mood swings so the pill doesn't Really affect me there and I haven't gotten pregnant. Yay to Trivora!,,F,19,1  years28,5/7/2013,Trivora-21
5, 2, prevent pregnancy,I originally was on depo provera and was loving it but however needed to have a period_ first switched to trinessa which I was experiencing nausia_ lower back pain_ bad cramps_ exhaustion and mild sore boobs. Then my family physician switched me to trivora ( had been on it when I was about 18 or 19 and had no problem with it). Well my nausia had got really bad_ I would over heat_ many time I ate_ I would get nausiated and sick to my stomach_ my boobs hurt constantly_ had constipation_ lower back pain_ really horrible abdominal cramps_ first month had long period and 2nd month had spottin first day then light light period for 2 maybe three days_ and also have horrible headaches_ seriosuly making me think I am pregnant and also been asked more than a few time if I am indeed pregnant. Don't really know if all this is from trivora but none of these are going away. I'm talking to my birth control doctor this month to see if I should switch.,,F,22,3  months28,9/9/2012,Trivora-21

7, 1, ,Started going to a new dr. and he felt that the dose contained in my previous pills was too high. I have tried everything from the patch_ depo (which gave me a light period for 6 months straight) and various brands of pills. Since staring trivora I have basically turned into a basket case. I have been experiencing bouts of depression_ anxiety_ and severe mood swings where I find myself gettig very angry for no apparent reason. All of this is accompanied by sporadic crying fits that I cannot seem to control. It is comforting to know that other people were having similar experiences... I will be calling my dr. on Monday to get a different pill!,,F,31,9  months,8/11/2012Email,Trivora-21

11, 3, removal of IUD,I had my IUD removed for some time now. After removal I gave my self time to get back to norm. But I don't like the feeling of worrying about when my period coming when I ovulate or being in the heat of the moment. My doctor originally prescribed DEPO. I took the prescription home never got it processed that was November. I went back to the doctor feb. For STI panel and hand him bk. Prescription stating DEPO want be for me when he suggested the pill....now I'm not good at time nor swallowing but for now it ain't bad. A little nausea_ bowl movement_ increase hunger_ irritable and moody..naw I can't say it is so bad as of now. Moving forward I just hope it suit the purpose. I will not allow my hormones to get out of wack.,,F,32,8  days50,3/4/2012Email,Trivora-21
12, 1, Birth Control,EXTREME weight gain. I was on the Depo shot for about two years. That worked great for me but I was terrified of needles and had to stop getting it because it was stressing me out. I switched to the pill. I hate it. I gained so much weight. 20 lbs. And I cannot_ for the life of me_ lose it. It was so rapid I thought there was something wrong.,,F,21,2  years 1X D,1/8/2012,Trivora-21
13, 1, Birth Control,Mood swings_ NO SEX DRIVE!,I have been on this pill for several years and have had no sex drive. I thought it was just stress in life but after doing some research I am finding this is a major side effect. It's ruining my new marriage and is not good. I also have terrible mood swings for no reason. I am not depressed but get angry easily which I am typically not that type of person. Will discontinue immediately.,F,28,2  years.15mg/.03m 1X D,11/21/2011Email,Trivora-21

15, 3, Preventing pregnancy,Increased sex drive (yay)_ increased appetite_ weight gain_ irritability_ constant fatigue,I wouldn't mind taking this if it weren't for the weight gain. It is very hard for me to maintain my weight due to physical reasons_ and just when I was finally satisfied with my weight I was set back due to this pill. It beats getting preggers though. I can deal with everything else. I just wish it didn't make me CONSTANTLY HUNGRY or tired.I hope the symptoms don't increase over time; I've only been taking it for 16 days.,F,22,16  days 1X D,9/21/2011,Trivora-21

Ive been on trivora for years_  I have no spotting_  i have 2 day periods_ no weight gain_ great sex drive_ no achene_ no thinning hair.  Very light cramps_  and typical modswings 2 days before starting.  And best of all im not pregnant.  It been great.  No complaints!,,,34,6  days 1X D,9/16/2011,Trivora-21

18, 2, Birth Control,I am usually a very calm and collected person and this drug has made me become just the opposite of that.  I feel like crying all the time for no reason.  Minor problems seem like much bigger issues to me so I stress out very often.  Somewhat depressed and my sex drive has decreased significantly.  I originally was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo which gave me very little side effects.  I switched because of money issues and also I had felt Ortho-Tri-Cyclen Lo had made me gain some weight.  Now I think i'd rather have a few extra pounds instead of the emotional insecurity this pill has caused.  I'm switching back at the end of this month.  It's worth to pay some extra money for Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.,,F,26,6  months 1X D,1/6/2011,Trivora-21
19, 1, Birth Control,nausea_ fatigue_ breast tenderness_ increased appetite_ low sex drive,I started taking trivora about eight months ago and since then I have had absolutely no sex drive_ an hour after i take my pill i have horrible nausea_ i'm always exhausted_ my breasts almost always hurt_ and I'm never full. I also noticed my discharge is much heavier and thicker and has an awful smell that i have never had before. I do not have any sexual diseases so the smell does not make sense. I have problems sleeping and am always depressed. My periods are shorter_ but they also come late in the month and give me that worry of a pregnancy. This is not the birth control for me and I feel that looking at the comments_ most people in my age frame have the same problems. I understand that it is one of the cheapest birth controls out there_ but I'm starting to realize that for a little more money a month all of these problems could go away.,F,21,8  months 1X D,11/22/2010,Trivora-21
20, 1, Birth Control,"monthly ""yeast infections_"" no labido_ increased anxiety and depression_ sore breasts_ crazy mood swings_ bloating and water retention.","I dont have insurance and this is what my doctor prescribed me_ so I have to tough it out one more month until I can get my insurance back and see my doctor. I was on Enpresse which was also not a good fit(again no health insurance=no ability to change) for awhile but SAFEWAY likes to switch back and forth between the pills because they will only carry what is cheaper. So in the last year I have been on Enpresse_ then Trivora_ then Enpresse again_ and now Trivora. Seriously. Anyways_ I have had monthly ""yeast infections"" and by that I mean my discharge becomes the consistency of Elmers Glue which happens around my 3rd week_ and that is about the time my mood swings and sex drive take a dive also. Its so consistent my boyfriend can count the days before my period just by the side effects. I cry all the time_ feel horrible about myself because not only does my self esteem take a dive_I gain about 3lbs in water weight which disapear when my period starts. I have not experienced permanent weight gain because I have been on the pill so long_ I am sure that happened a few years ago. I would not reccommend this pill to anyone and I would certainly not recommend filling any perscriptions at Safeway.",F,22,1  years 1X D,11/16/2010,Trivora-21
21, 3, birth control,weight gain,I seemed to have gained a lot of weight lately. Has anyone else had this problem? I am 43 and have been taking this for 5 years. It seems that in the last 2 years I've put on more and more weight.,F,43,5  years 1X D,10/27/2010Email,Trivora-21
22, 3, Birth Control,none so far,I'm starting to worry...came on to see what other people had to say because I've been feeling so unbelievably sluggish and tired the past 2 days and was wondering if the new birth control I'm on is the reason?Has anyone else experienced feeling tired this early on? I'm only on my 2nd day!I'm praying the side effects don't get worse!,F,22,2  daysunsure 1X D,10/23/2010Email,Trivora-21
23, 1, Prevent pregnancy,nausea_ tiredness_ worthlessness_ and major depression,I haven't been on trivora for that long_ i was originally on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and I loved it.  I was on it since I was in highschool_ and recently swithched.  I had to change when we got new insurance!  i wouldn't recommend this pill to anybody! I feel irratable all the time_ cry for no reason_ and i feel so depressed that i feel like doing something bad.  I'm so glad that there's other girls on here that are experiencing the same side effects as me!   As soon as I had my period it was like I had relief of all the symptoms.  Then i started taking it again_ and i started feeling depressed again.  I quit taking it immediately!  i can't wait for things to get back normal!,F,25,9  months28 1X D,9/28/2010,Trivora-21
24, 3, birth control,nausea_ breast tenderness_ increase appetite_ tiredness_ moody,I had taken this years ago over a period of two years_ then ceased all birth control methods for about a year. The side effects seem to have increased now.,F,28,28  days 1X D,9/15/2010,Trivora-21
25, 4, BC,when i first started taking it i had headaches and my weight didnt change but i went off it for a month too see if my mood swings would change (witch they didnt) and I GAINED WEIGHT.. so i got back on it and my weight hasnt changed. overall no problems.,i think its a pretty decent birth control. i have heard worse stuff about others.,F,17,8  months 1X D,8/21/2010,Trivora-21
26, 3, Birth control,-cleared up back acne-increased breast size-lightened period SUBSTANTIALLY-shortened period to 4 days-depression-random irrated fits-paranoia-insecurity,While Trivora helped me with several physical issues such as severe back acne I had been struggling with for 5 years and lightening my normally extremely heavy periods it had its down sides. The medication substantially hurt my mood and I developed some extreme paranoia and small details that I never would notice had me in tears. The moods cannot be predicted either_ they are not only during my period week_ they continue through-out the month. I have been trying to wait it out for the full 3 months recommended_ but now that I am onto the first week of my 3rd month_ I am positive I will be switching when the time comes.,F,19,28  days 1X D,6/17/2010,Trivora-21
27, 5, elimate PMS and reduce migraines,no side effects,I took Trivora primarly to reduce PMS and migraines and when sexually active as a form of B/C. Last year I went off B/C to give my body a rest and see if my PMS and migraines would come back. Keep in mind I would skip the placebo and not have a period to avoid PMS and migraines. I would allow myself to have a period twice a year.During this year my migraines have returned_ especially in the last six months and in the last two months my PMS is worse than ever in my life. Possibly I am entering periomenopause. I am going back on Trivora after my period this month since it was so helpful for many years. Too early for horomone replacement therapy.,F,43,7  years 1X D,6/7/2010,Trivora-21
28, 4, Birthcontrol & cysts on ovaries,bad acne a week before period_ beautiful skin the rest of the month. Heavy flow on time of period_ spotting before period. very moody_ an have depression issues.,i like taking trivora. it keeps the cysts away_ which are very painful to have on your ovaries.

30, 4, having sex,i think im more moody and more mean_ i sometimes get headaches but im not sure if the pill is the reason why. i do feel nauseated sometimes. when i take my pill i feel as if its harder for me to breath and raises my heart rate?..witch i think maybe because of stress and anxiety,i barely have side effects.,F,16,6  months 1X D,5/9/2010,Trivora-21
31, 4, Birth Control,None to mild.,I have been very_ very happy with Trivora. No side effects to speak of. I do feel very sick if I miss a pill and have to take 2 at a time...now I just try to do that on a full stomach. Perhaps a slight weight loss ~3lbs...I say that because recently went off Trivora and gained a few pounds. I went off Trivora to get pregnant and got pregnant within 3 months.,F,42,5  years 1X D,5/6/2010,Trivora-21
32, 3, Birth Control,Weight gain? Gagging/Nausea_ extended period_ breast growth,My periods do not start on the 'placebo' week (it starts monday I start sat) I use to have heavy bleeding for 2-3 days_ now I have medium to heavy bleeding 7-8 days. Cramps and headaches still occur week prior to period. Breast have gone from large C to small DD. Possible weight gain from this.Worse symptom I have which just recently started -after about 11 months on it- is I am gagging all the time_ and not as a reaction to something I could just be walking through my house and then I will gag and cough and nearly throw up. And oh if I am to smell something or think of a food which may make me feel sick I am ready to throw up in a quick second.,F,20,13  months 1X D,3/12/2010,Trivora-21

I have no motivation to do very much of anything.,F,16,18  days 1X D,2/23/2010,Trivora-21
35, 5, Birth Control,None,I've been taking Trivora for approx. 5 years and haven't experienced any negative symptoms (no weight gain_ cramping_ abnormal emotional lows or anything of the sort)_ thankfully. I should also say that it seems to treat acne_ and has given me lighter periods with minimal-no cramping.  Every now and then I'll use Trivora back to back as well_ with no problems (ie_ missing a period completely by skipping over the placebo week and going straight to the first pill in the next packet).  Overall I recommend Trivora.,F,21,5  years,12/21/2009,Trivora-21
36, 5, birth control,mild acne,I have had no large side effects from this BC. I was on Ortho-Tri before and it made me feel very depressed.Then I was on Yaz and I had terrible spotting every month as well as mood swings. Next_ I was on a random mono-phasic BC that caused me to have spotting but my mood was balanced again. Finally_ I found Tri-Vora. This BC is a perfect balance for me. I have light 2 day periods and no mood swings. To those of you who are experiencing troubles_ I would suggest talking to your doctor about the pro's and con's of every birth control you have ever taken. Let them help you find one that is good for you! Keep trying if you are not satisfied!,F,21,2  years,11/20/2009,Trivora-21

I have also experienced mood swings and mild depression.  Additionally_ I am experiencing cramping.  On the positive side_ I guess_ my appetite seems slightly suppressed so I have experienced a slight weight loss.

Fatigue_ Nausea,Stop believing the hype the pharmaceutical companies pump out to you. BC pills are far from healthy and are not the same as the hormones circulating in your body. I had to go through hell to find that out. The Doctors are clueless and the pharmaceutical companies laugh all the way to the bank.

59, 1, ,Do not take this B.C. It makes me crazy...I thought it would get better overtime_ but my symptoms are worse. I am angry all the time_ moody_ I cry for no reason_ and I am extremely bloated the week before my period. This is my last week taking Trivora. I will never take this again.,I never thought that I felt like this because of my birthcontrol until I took a month off and did not take the birth control. My sex drive came back_ I had a normal appetite_ and my mood swings were gone. This B.C. was not for me.,F,24,2  years,11/18/2008,Trivora-21
60, 2, My husband and I do not want kids,Weight gain_ loss of sex drive...just feeling like im not attractive anymore just a fat blob. its supposed to help with fatigue and i get tired easier than usual.,the other BC i was on before did not make me gain this much weight_ this is riduculous!! It would make more sense for the hormones to help you balance yourself out and not gain as much weight. i liked it better when i didnt take it.,F,21,4  months,11/6/2008,Trivora-21

62, 1, irregular periods,mood swings_ severe depression_ anxiety_ headaches,I have been taking this BC for almost a full year now. I didn't notice severe symptoms for the first few months but they have progressively been getting worse and worse.  I have been dealing with the side effects and I dind't realize they could be directly connected to Trivora until i came across this website.  I have been very depressed and extremely emotional and irritable.  This usually happens the entire week before i get my period.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a better birth control without these horrible side effects?,F,25,1  years,11/4/2008,Trivora-21

64, 1, Abnormal Periods,Sick_Spotting_Discharge_Acne_Heavy Bladder_Bloating_Tired_Back pain,The worse experience ever from day one_ I was sick every night before I tried to go to bed. It made me tired after work. I still spotted when it was supposed to regulate my period. My hole body is breaking out_ arms_ legs_ shoulders_ neck face_ ears_ hands_ almost every part of my body. I've noticed discharge since taking it and I've had to pee alot more. I originally started off with Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and loved it_ its controlled my weight_ skin problems_ and controlled my period_ thank god. But Now there is no Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo_ and im having to test the Birth control methods. It's scary having to experience all of this before finding the right medicine for me.,F,20,2  weeks,10/16/2008Email,Trivora-21
65, 5, Contraceptive reasons,Mood swings before period (but this is normal). Way less painful cramping during period_ more predictable and regular cycle,Very good_ I've been taking it for appx 6 months now. I'm aware of all the side effects that birth control pills usually bring and that people tend to switch around to find the right pill.

I switched to tri-levlen before switching to Trivora and i absolutely hate it. i'm constantly fighting with my poor boyfriend and feel angry_ sad_ extremely depressed and insecure ALL the time... when i stop taking it for my period_ its almost a relief because of the mental/emotional symptoms. i have never been an unhappy/angry person in my life_ but i've become unmanageable... any small conflict turns me into an emotional wreck where i think i'm seriously going to do something bad! i hate this pill and its so damn hard to get ahold of my doctor to discuss... i'm soooo relieved to see that i'm not the only one experiencing these problems...,F,25,6  months,9/1/2007,Trivora-21

I gained weight that exercise couldn't get rid of_ I experienced decreased libido and massive headaches daily_. the periodic depression and mood swings became more frequent and severe_ making me ""unpredictable"" according to  my boyfriend who has been far too understanding with all of this. This pill was not me although all of these types of BC tend to have mixed results. I guess its just a matter of finding something that works with your body's chemistry.

While on Trivora_ I didn't experience any weight gain or moodiness.   My body (boobs and all) stayed the same_ and so did my emotional well-being.  One thing that did change was my period.  It lasted 3 days_ and I experienced REALLY heavy bleeding (normally_ I would bleed lightly for 5 days on Ortho Novum).,I generally have clear skin_ but have some pimples here and there on my forehead region.

95, 4, Birth Control,Bloating/increase in appetite during 3rd week of pills,I was originally on Trilevlen (Berlex) before my insurance switched me over to the generic_ and I think this is much better than the Trilevlen because Trilevlen made me so moody I would start crying in the middle of the day.  I tried switching to monophasic pills_ but those made me gain 10 pounds so I switched back_ and with Trivora_ I've gone back to my original weight_ my libido is the same_ I don't have mood swings_ and my appetite decreased back to normal.,F,21,3  months,6/11/2007,Trivora-21

The rest of the month I would be crampy_ bloated_ irritable_ exhausted_ my legs ached and my breast would be tender and THEN I would get my period!!! I never had problems with bc pills until these damn piece of sh*t insurance companies decided they didn't want to pay for brand-name prescriptions. As long as I'm on a brand-name bc pill I have no problems but as soon as I get switched to a generic form all hell breaks loose. I'm really tired of these corporate giants trying to dictate to me and everyone else what they think is better for us!

I hadn't had any problems_ that i noticed_ but now that I have just read one particular rating_ I am beginning to think that this is my problem.  I have had SEVERE pain while urinating_ not just once in awhile_ but everytime_ for 4 straight years!  I also have been to the ER_ Urologists_ etc. had 50 million tests_ only for them to find nothing wrong with me.  It never dawned on me that it could be the birth control.  I am definitely going to switch!  Thank you for helping me!  Good luck to all of you!,F,24,5  years,3/20/2007Email,Trivora-21

102, 1, Birth control,Severe urinary pain.  I took this medicine for five years.  I've never found anything that said that this side effect was a possibility.  It never even occured to me that it could be caused by my birth control until I decided to get an IUD due to the side effect of lowered sex drive.  Now that I don't take Trivora anymore I don't hurt all the time.  I went to doctors all the time and they kept just telling me that I had a UTI because all of the symptoms were the same.  I even went to the ER twice because the pain was so bad.  I even went to a urologist_ and no one could tell me what was wrong.  Eventually it began to weaken my bladder.  I can't even tell you how much it hurt if I didn't drink a gallon of water every day.  I gained weight too_ but that's probably due to my less than ideal diet.  And I got huge boobs too.  I went from a small B to a big D.  That was neat_ but not worth it.,I started out taking the name brand Triphasil_ but I had to switch to Trivora after because my insurance wouldn't pay for the formulary if a generic was available.  I had the problem with both of them.  I just want people to know that the urinary pain is a possible side effect.  I would have switched in a heartbeat if I knew that it might have been the birthcontrol I was taking.,F,26,5  years,3/5/2007,Trivora-21

I just visited the doctor today and am going back on Tri-phasil with the extra cost out of pocket.

107, 4, period regulation,cramping,Even though birth control is supposed to help your cramps_ I get some vicious ones on Trivora.  However_ it hasn't given me mood problems and my period is regular enough to set a clock to.  It also has not caused any weight gain_ which Ortho-Tri did_ so I can't complain there.  I like it.,F,23,3  years,3/20/2006,Trivora-21

I have been on it for several months and are finally down to my last pack (couldn't switch earlier due to cost).  I will never take this brand again.  Normally I am not a very emotional person.  On this med. I cry almost daily over the slightest thing.  I used to enjoy watching Extreme Makeover: Home Edition_ but have now stopped watching it since I cried through most of the show.
