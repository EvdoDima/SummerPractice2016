0, 1, Acid Reflux_ Barretts Esophogus,Hair loss_ possibly anxiety and depression,I am 22 now_ I was prescribed prilosec when was 15 to prevent my barretts esophogus from advancing. I just recently put two and two together. I used to have very thick hair and within a year of starting prilosec you could see my scalp through my now thin and shiny hair. And it only got progressively worse since then to the point I now buzz my head once a week. I stopped prilosec about a month ago and it seems like the hair is starting to grow back slightly_ hoping to see continued growth. I watch what I eat and havent had any bad reflux episodes.I have also battled some pretty bad anxiety and depression since starting prilosec. I always chalked it up to going thru my teenage years. Havent really felt bad since stopping prilosec.Going to my primary care and a dermotologist in a couple weeks to get hormone panels and nutrient panels done. I refuse to take any new medications after prilosec,M,22,6  years20mg 2X D,8/16/2016Email,Prilosec
1, 1, Indigestion_belching,POISON TO MY SYSTEM--WISH I HAD READ THESE POSTS FIRST< NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE ON IT!!! I first want to say that I am a normally healthy individual who does not like to see a doctor unless I really have to (although I do have yearly well-visits). Saw my dr. with complaint of indigestion/feeling of fullness in stomach/belching that was not relieved by Tums or baking soda and was put on Omeprazole DR 40 mg 1x a day in am...I really thought that this drug was like a prescription Tums (NOT!)_ but only because I had not done any research on it and was simply going by my assumption. Symptoms got worse and included chest tightness_ stabbing chest pain near heart and radiating to underarms and up the side of neck on left side_ heart palpitations_ tingling in fingers_ brain fog all day_ worsening constriction in throat that made swallowing difficult_ sweaty palms and sole of feet_ extreme dry mouth that was not quenched by water_ no sleep due to increasing symptoms. Dr. then added Pepcid AC a,Please do not give up hope if you are experiencing awful symptoms from this chemical. There is hope and you are not alone! If you are on this site trying to decide whether to go on this drug_ I would strongly urge you to seriously consider the risks involved_ especially if you have had any sensitivities to medication in the past (looking back_ I realize that I have trouble stomaching narcotics because they cause nausea and vomiting for me. Was put on a Fentanyl patch about 10 years ago after thoracic surgery and had to have it immediately removed due to chest pain/tightness and EXTREME dry mouth). If anyone has any suggestions for detoxing this drug out of the body quicker_ PLEASE email me. What worked for you to help regain your life??,F,52,11  days40 mg 1X D,8/10/2016Email,Prilosec
2, 1, Possible GERD or Ulcer,While coming off this drug I felt heartburn for the first time in my life I think_ I was very anxious / panicky and had pains all over my abdomen (gallbladder pains_ kidney_ sternum area_ etc).  I also got canker sores regularly.  I'm in the process of weaning off this drug which is not something they tell you you'll have to do when they sign you up for it.,I've read articles on how this is over-prescribed and completely agree.  I'm very disappointed in the medical industry in the US as literally NOTHING was discussed w/ me prior to being prescribed this medication.  I would never take it again.,M,40,3  months40 MG 1X D,8/8/2016,Prilosec

5, 3, Acid Reflux,I had acid reflux really bad when I was 22 and tried this. It worked. It took a very long time to actually work though. It took about 6 months to make me feel 100% better. I'm now 30 and haven't taken it in a long time_ but now have severe acid reflux (keep in mind I did not take this for the last 7 years so it's mainly from poor eating habits). I have taken it for a month so far with no improvements. I am hoping it will kick in eventually. This isn't the type of drug to work right away_ you really need to think long term with it_ and also change your eating habits in order to feel better. It my experiences it got worse for a while before it got better. For a whole month mine felt worse_ but now I feel like it's starting to let up. If it doesn't work even a little bit after 2 months I suggest taking something else. Some meds make it worse to the point it's unbearable and losec shouldn't do that. It might make it worse a little and it's uncomfortable since your stomach isn't used to it,Works but takes a while.,F,30,6  months40mg 1X D,7/3/2016Email,Prilosec

Stiff neck_ jaw and upper arm/under arm discomfort continue on and off despite stopping 4 1/2  weeks ago.,I took Rantidine for 2 weeks followed Prilosec OTC for 14 days followed by Protonix for 21 days. I switched from one to the other based side effects. I feel I should have never taken anything.

7, 1, Dyspepsia,8 week after stopping 4 th review. Pulse still up but by end of say now can be as low as 70 bpm. Dizziness subsided now and foggy head.,The last 2 weeks saw the symptoms come and go.

8, 1, Heartburn,Just now realizing that many of the ills I have been experiencing in the last few years may_ in fact_ have been related to the taking of this medication.,Developed frequent heartburn symptoms back in the 70s and self-medicated with Tums with little knowledge of heartburn causes. Dr diagnosed me with probable Hiatal Hernia and with little relief in sight began taking Prilosec OTC 20mg in 2003 when first made available. A few years ago asked Dr for a reduced prescription_ the 10mg version - this worked fine but about 4 years ago started having asthma-like symptoms - Dr said it might be exercise induced - thought it might be Nsaids and exchanged for Tylenol. Yearly tests showed low vit D3_ so Dr started me on 5_000 units daily. All other tests have come back normal. 3 yrs ago legs started hurting - hips/thighs/calves - like arthritis but not relieved by anti-inflammatory foods_ exercise or OTC pain relievers. Sleep_ stairs_ even sitting_ all became very painful and have flare-ups like with arthritis. A week ago hip felt dislocated after sitting for long period - extreme pain with leg weakness - then found this site! Thinking Prilosec may_ indeed_ be the problem_ a week ago started splitting 10mg capsule_ i.e._ reducing dose to 5mg/day. Took this for one week - yesterday started dividing the pellets in thirds_ i.e._ a 3.3mg/day dosage. Have had only one mild heartburn breakthrough_ solved with old familiar Tums. Need to get off this medication - find a natural treatment. Know it is early but can feel hip/leg pain subsiding already today - only 8th day on reduced dosage. Hope this helps others.,F,68,13  years10mg 1X D,6/13/2016Email,Prilosec

Heart palps almost gone. My pulse is down to 85 bpm so does continue to drop so I can't feel it any more which is great.  I feel a little uneasy first hour in morning but after taking 100 mg magnesium_ cod liver oil capsule all symptoms go - have started intermittent jogging which seems to be working. Nearly there after 6 weeks I will report back at wek 8 as I feel the medication will be out of my system and I will have recovered fully.

It took 4 weeks to start feeling my normal self art year_This year I have started a magnesium supplement_ b12 patches and cod liver oil supplement once I have stopped.  All the symptoms went away within a week with the exception of heart palpitations/ anxiety and numbness on cheekbone/ face.  As soon as I take the magnesium these tend to subside and it's now 2 1/2 weeks since my last pill.  I will come back after a month to say if all side effects now gone as this has been really scary.

13, 1, Stomach pain,severe back pain_ neck stiffness_ throat tightness and dryness,i was prescribed this at the ER because they didn't know what was wrong with me. after a couple days of taking this it made my throat feel super tight like there was a rubber band around it. i wasn't having any difficulty breathing but it was very uncomfortable. my throat felt very dry too no matter how much liquid i drank. then i got severe back pains that kept me on a heating pad for the whole duration of the medicine. 4 days after stopping the medicine the back pain and stiff neck went away and my throat went back to normal. but it didn't help my stomach problem. i was still having the symptoms i had before the medicine. this stuff is poison.you feel worse than you did before taking the medicine!,F,20,9  days15mg 1X D,5/13/2016Email,Prilosec

I had the worse shakes and was so jittery coming off this drug.

I wouldn't give this drug to anyone! It should be outlawed. I am stricken with severe respiratory and sinus infections that never go away since this drug. 3 years later and I am still sick with medical issues.

16, 1, Silent Reflux,Headaches (front of head / forehead)_ lightheaded / dizzy_ balance issues_ eye pain/ pressure_  felt like walking in a fog all the time,Started taking Omeprazole in Dec. 2015.  First few weeks were fine.  Slowly developed a constant headache between/ above my eyes which worsened over time.  Went to ENT 3 times (was first told I had sinus inflammation and was prescribed a steroid; next was told I had a bad sinus infection and was prescribed antibiotic; third time everything was clear - CT confirmed)_ neurologist (nothing found)_ allergist (nothing found)_ ophthalmologist (nothing found)_ and ER - twice (nothing found).  GI kept telling me most issues were NOT related to Prilosec - with the exception of the headache.  On March 21_ decided to quit medication.  Initially_ symptoms continued with little change.  However_ around 4 weeks later the headaches started to reduce in intensity and fog and lightheadedness began to lift.  It's now been 6 weeks since I stopped the drug and I can now get through most of the day without feeling awful.  The symptoms aren't completely gone and I still get eye pressure/ pain and headaches_ but they have definitely improved tremendously.  With no other changes to my lifestyle or diet_ it would appear the drug was causing all of my symptoms.  For those of you suffering out there_ there does appear to be hope once the drug is fully metabolized.  Every doctor I spoke with told me the Omeprazole had nothing to do with my symptoms.  Perhaps they were right...HOWEVER_ once I stopped the drug I finally got my life back.  Good luck to you if you are suffering!!!  Don't give up,M,43,4  months40 2X D,5/9/2016Email,Prilosec

It was hard for me to identify these side effects as they creep up on you slowly and you just don't know what's happening to your body. My urine would smell like cereal and I would always be thirsty especially at bedtime and during the night. My chest would hurt and I had tingling on my arms and legs.,WOW! Lots of problems associated with this drug. I agree with the bottle labeling of using only for a very short period of time_ if at all! Find other means of dealing with it. For me_ I now watch what I eat and drink; no coffee_ no Coke Cola and other low pH foods. I also sleep on my left side at night to keep stomach contents in stomach and not getting in the esophagus. I drink spring water or city water that has a pH of 7 or higher. Most bottled DRINKING WATER is acidic. No good. Get some pH litmus paper and test yourself. Alkaline water (pH above 7) is the best. From now on_ if my doctor gives me another  prescription I will have him test me for side effects and possible nutritional deficiencies such as vitamins and minerals.,M,58,7  years40 mg 1X D,3/17/2016Email,Prilosec

All the things I love I can't have.  On the first couple months had gas_ bloating_ fatigue until it seemed the the meds were working.  I enjoyed about a year of feeling comfortable with the few side effects and the med actually working.  Then I started getting abdominal pain.. a couple days at a time then it would go away.  Then it would happen again a month later and would last longer.  At one point it was constant abdominal pain with terrible foul smelling watery diarrhea.  Got all sorts of tests and they showed nothing.  Dr said it had to be the omeprazole so he switched me to pantoprazole which didn't help.  Weened myself off all PPIs to avoid acid rebound with 1 week of 40mg/20mg every other day.  Then 1 week of all 20mg.  Then 1 week of 20 mg every other day.  2 weeks later all the stomach pain and diarrhea was gone.

38, 1, Tummy lining & duodenum inflamation,Took in a.m. before food as directed.  After ONLY ONE DOSE by bedtime that same night I began smelling a musty musky floral odor. Very strong_ like an incense was stuck up my nostrils. I was looking all over the house trying to figure out where the odor was coming from_ until I realized it was my senses. it was so overpowering & nasty I began spritzing myself with Victoria Secret Cologne & used matching body lotion just trying to do anything to cover up the other odor. I tried to force myself asleep and that's when the other symptoms started. My left arm was killing me I could hardly lift it. Other muscles were absolutely throbbing. My legs were restless h aching_ like what my friend describes her RLS feels like. I felt like I couldn't breathe right_ as though it was labored breathing and my chest hurt.,After experience nausea day in-day out 24 hours a day I went to see the gastro doctor. they used the scope did a biopsy an I was told I had severe stomach lining erosion from years of NSAID use_ which I took to manage chronic back pain from previously broken vertabraes. The doctor put me on protonix_ another PPI_ and I took it for a year with no adverse effects. My stomach lining healed & I stoppedthe medication.  A year later I ended up in the ER  with severe pain tucked under my left ribs. Another scope revealed I now have inflammation in duodenum_ only my new gastro dr put me on prilosec. So_ after all of the side effects I described above after my first dose I discontinued Prilosec & called my doctor. He switched me back to Protonix. It took 5 days for the side effects from just one dose of Prilosec to subside. Look_  all of our chemistry is different and unique to ourselves_ and while this PPI work horribly for me another has been a godsend. Don't give up_ some of us must take these medications or risk things like bleeding ulcers or cancer from chronic inflammation.

I would sit in house all day barely able to muster the energy to accomplish simple tasks. Also numb tingling in toes at nite_ and my joints that have arthritis felt worse. I cannot stay on this drug and not willing to try other PPIs.  Not sure what to do as Dr. thinks I must take something for the Barretts. I just stopped taking_ and praying I don't get the awful rebound reflux others describe. Felt much better 24 hrs. after last pill.  Normally I don't feel my reflux_ so maybe it won't be so bad_ but I have to worry about esoph. damage which is concerning.

44, 1, Gastritis,Anxiety_ increased heart beat_ feelings of panic_ thoughts seem more obsessive_ dry mouth_ slow stomach emptying_ insomnia_ tingling feeling under skin_ low mood_ some headaches_ eye sight seems worse (will be getting this checked out at opticians asap),I was diagnosed with moderate haemorraghic gastritis which was alarming as I don't drink_ smoke_ take anti inflammatories etc. I have been under stress for some time however. The H Pylori test came back negative but I know this can be wrong. The consultant recommended high dose PPI's however I am intolerant so can just manage this low dose. Even that gives me side effects. I hve to take something for the gastritis and don't know how to manage the increase in anxiety it is causing.  Would appreciate any help about dealing with the gastritis without this and also how to deal with / manage the anxiety whilst still on the drug.,F,57,18  days10mg 1X D,12/19/2015Email,Prilosec
45, 1, Hoarse voice,Diarrhea_ nauseau_ headache_ belching,"Had bad sore throat one month ago followed by runny nose and cough.  Didn't go to doctor and figured it was just a cold. The sore throat was so painful I took Advil. A few days later my throat felt better but completely lost my voice.  Should have let it rest but did not.  I do a lot of public speaking and know I probably over used it.  My voice improved but it is still not the same.  I went to an urgent care concerned it may have been strep but Dr.  tried to tell me it was probably bc of gerd (after 2 minutes with me) and prescribed me 2 months of Prilosec!!! Never have any acid reflux symptons and I eat fairly well. (I understand it can be ""silent"")  even just after a few days I don't like how I feel and glad I came across this site.

46, 1, Acid Reflux,Neuropathy_ chest tightness_ pain in joints_ swollen and bent fingers.,DO NOT TAKE. As others mentioned_ this drug and others like antibiotics_ steroids and NSAIDs destroy your gut flora.  The resulting imbalance can lead to leaky gut and_ then as in my case_ autoimmune reactions and disease.  I now have gluten and other food sensitivities.    I am not self diagnosed.  I can see many other people here have the same problem without them knowing the exact reason.  Report this to the FDA and your insurance co.  The Drs do not know. I was given cipro for prostate problems. Unnecessarily as it turned out.   This resulted in gastro problems.  I did not make the connection.  Neither did Drs. Drs then put me on Prilosec (1 week 1x20_ 2 week 2x20) for the resulting acid reflux. When I then developed bent fingers they wanted to treat me for RA!!  I finally found a Dr who knows.(Mass General). Do your research.  It could be a long time before I am well.  Good luck to you.,M,59,3  weeks40 1X D,12/1/2015Email,Prilosec

50, 1, supposed GERD,awful side effects that still persist 11 weeks later including brain fog_ palpitations_ disconnected_ memory loss_ tunnel vision_ ears popping_ parasthesias_ joint pain_ dry throat,OFF FOR 11 WEEKS - RECOMMENDATIONS TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS AWFUL DRUG- GET NEUROFEEDBACK!!!! I pointed to the part of my head that was hurting and the technician said that's the trauma part of the brain. He did neurofeedback and it was like a fog was lifted and I could feel normal emotions again. This drug causes you to be in a constant state of fight or flight and you get PTSD. The side effects I still have after 11 weeks off is a panic attack that wakes me up at 5 am_ slight brain fog_ slight hypoglycemic feeling_ but much better. ALSO_ I went to a naturopath who is going to have me do a spit test to test my cortisol levels throughout the day. Being in fight or flight raises cortisol and makes you feel hypoglycemic. Everyone on or coming off this drug should eat every 2 hours a meal with a complex carb_ a fat_ and a protein because you are under such a state of stress from all the cortisol you will become hypoglycemic which will make your blood pressure and everything else irregular. Also_ look into yoga_ somatic body training_ qi gong_ and acupuncture. Also_ take adrenal supplements if you're on cortisol overload from this drug and take probiotics_ fish oil_ vitamin D_ magnesium_ lemon water_ and Rescue Remedy. I'm also taking Chinese herbs. Contact me if you want help. Check if you have a MTHFR genetic defect which makes PRiILOSEC a very dangerous medication for you because you. Especially_ try neurofeedback to get your brain off the panic and anxiety ro,F,32,42  days 1X D,10/29/2015Email,Prilosec

My chest felt clogged so I went to the doctor. He felt my stomach and said it was tender so prescribed Omeprozal for 28 days. 40mg (2 x 20mg per day). While taking this tablet_ I have never felt so terrible - it has seriously been the worst time of my life. Within days of taking the tablets I was experiencing high anxiety_ shaking_ numbness in my arms and legs and itching. Within 7 days_ I experienced an allergic reaction to an avocado - something I have eaten for years. I went back to the doctor who didn't associate my new symptoms to Omperazol and instead gave me a weeks dose of steriods (to help with the allergies) it worked for a week but my symptoms got worse - all this time I had no idea it was related to Omperazol. My tongue would swell up and feel like it was being cut into pieces and my throat swelled up. My anxiety was at an all time high (I've never experienced anxiety before). I eventually went from 40mg to 20mg after 2 weeks_ and then was on 1 tablet a day for 4 days and then completely off Omperazol bcos I couldn't handle the side affects and realised everything bad I experienced started after I was on the tablets.

It was weird cause I never felt any heartburn. What I had was called ""silent heartburn."" Started to feel odd about a week or two in (on the drug)_ and was convinced it was because I had lost 50 lb's in about 1.5 months. I thought it was due (the weight loss) from me doing a 360 on my diet and quitting drinking. I was totally convinced I was experiencing PAW's - cause I had no other explanation of why I felt so odd. After months went by and I still feeling like I had the flu every SINGLE day_ I knew it had to be something else.

66, 1, Heart burn/acid reflux,Anxiety_ numbness/tingling in lip and hand_ heavy chest_ joint pain_ muscle weakness_ crying/moodiness_ blurry vision_ dry eyes_ migraines_ dizziness_ brain fog.,My daughter experienced joint pain by the 3rd day on medication.  Her doctor said it couldn't do that and it was unrelated.  So we continued medication and symptoms just kept piling up and evolving. This drug didn't help her acid reflux so her doctor switched her to Prevacid.  She was on that for 1 month and it helped the reflux but her side effects continued. We discontinued after 1 month.  Her side effects were not letting up after going off and we were led to believe it wasn't even due to the medication. So we went to a rheumatologist but they ruled out arthritis. Her regular doctor ran blood work that didn't reveal anything. We then went to a neurologist. They did an mri of brain which was normal. At this point my daughters muscle weakness got so bad that she couldn't walk unassisted for 5 days.  We took her to ER and they did mri of her whole spine just to find nothing. Blamed it on anxiety.  They brought in PT which got her up and walking and sent us home.  Not one doctor along the way would link the medication to her symptoms.  She stopped the medication 6 1/2 months ago and is still suffering from many side effects. This drug is horrible along with Prevacid. Would not recommend it to ANYONE! Would definitely explore natural alternative if need be in future.  My daughter has gone through so much in the last 8 1/2 months. I'm so glad I found this sight because we would still be wondering why all this is happening since the doctors won't admit anything.,F,11,1  months20mg,8/2/2015,Prilosec

I could go on.......... I have experienced a gradual improvement since I stopped taking the drug_ dramatic at first when nausea_ headache_ flatulence and general unwell feeling disappeared almost overnight. I had a further dramatic improvement when I started supplementing with magnesium in March and lost the extreme depression_ anxiety and vertigo_ again within a few days. I can now get mildly excited and look forward to things again and my appetite is coming back a little.

82, 1, Dysphagia and GERD,Anxiety_ depression_ fatigue_ insomnia_ apathy_ suicidal ideation etc.,Started taking this as a young teenager and after 12 years decided it was time to stop because I had read omeprazole could cause osteoporosis if taken long term.  Very quickly (within 2 days) after discontinuation a lot of what I had thought were mental health issues lessened considerably and I felt so much better emotionally apart from a few episodes of crying for no reason in the few weeks after stopping. I had seen psychiatrists for 10 years but could never get a decent diagnosis or work out any causes for my depression and so on.  I am certain it was omeprazole contributing to my poor mental health especially as these side effects seem to have just crept up on me. I am now a little upset that if I had not taken this drug for so very long I might have done better at school and university which was always a struggle.  But_ anyway_ I am so much happier without it and it is never too late to have stopped.  However_ I do recognise that there are medical circumstances where such a drug as omeprazole together with any side effects is definitely worth taking as it does stop stomach acid.  The point is I wouldn't fear taking this drug for a short period if you need it_ but don't be left on it for no reason like me.  As for how I dealt with acid on withdrawal_ I took Gaviscon Advance double action 6 times a day for 2 weeks.  It worked great.,M,26,12  years20-40mg 1X D,5/19/2015,Prilosec

I noticed fatigue when doing simple things like walking to my car or climbing stairs_ then I got severe muscle cramps_ particularly at night. This drug depletes magnesium which_ I assume_ caused the cramping. The piece de resistance was the rash. It began in my genitals and quickly spread to over 60% of my body which felt like it was on fire. The itching was similar to that of poison oak. After three conversations with advice nurses who just didn't get it and who prescribed ineffective meds I finally was seen by a doc. Now I'm on a steroid and other stuff and it's finally calming down. But I can't wear clothing without discomfort which is a bit of a problem.

So it is not a stretch to think that if lansoprazole could do this rats_ probably omeprazole has the same effect on Substance P and anxiety. Increase substance P also causes increased pain.

101, 1, GERD,I took OTC low dosage Ranitidene for several years on and off. I had a panic attack and was hospitalised - I realised later that as I have a hiatial hernia which can reverse the convex/concave position of the diaphram this can cause shortness of breath leading to a panic attack. The hospital was useless_ after five hours and recovered I just went home. Went to GP had loads of tests_ I'm fighting fit according to all those_ but was told that I have Barrett's Oesophagus and that more episodes of GERD might become cancerous - I've since found research from USA that says this is not right_ the incidence of this is well below 1% of all Barrett's sufferers.

I asked about acid presence during endoscopy_ but Dr. said there was none present -I had fasted for 16 hours though. He said I still may have too high acid_ but I also may have too low acid (either could cause reflux_ I suspect low acid). This has not been confirmed by my Dr_ either way.

Developed anxiety attacks and depression after a month or so on those meds.  Discontinued use. Six months ago_ my current doctor put me on omeprozole (Prilosec) for stomach issues.  She figured a smaller dose would be effective without side effects.  2 months ago I developed strange sensations in my feet_ hands and skin.  My feet would feel numb while wearing shoes and sometimes burn on the bottom.  Sometimes one foot and other times both feet.  My right hand would feel tingly and parts of my face would feel numb. I have discomfort in my elbows/wrists and inside my biceps at times.  These symptoms will come and go and change severity.  Areas of my back and arms would burn.  I thought I was developing shingles but no modeling or symptoms visible on the skin.  Then 2 weeks ago I had a severe anxiety attack.

104, 1, Acid Reflux,I had the same exact symptoms everyone is describing here (anxiety_ brain fog_ lack of concentration_ panic attacks_ dizziness_ etc.)  I did some research before going to the doctor and I found an FDA study that points to Omeprazole depleting Magnesium levels in the body [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm245011.htm].  This combined with a poor diet (i.e. processed foods) leads to all the symptoms I had been having.  I've been taking magnesium supplements (along with B1 and B12) and things are returning to normal.  I did go to my local doctor to see what she had to say and it was exactly what I expected.  Ignored my research and tried to treat the symptoms_ not the cause.  Wanted to put me on prozac!  Typical modern day doctor_ refuses to listen to alternatives and goes right for the drugs.,On a side note_ the drug works to prevent acid re-flux_ no question but at what cost.

My muscles also started cramping very badly everywhere from my fingers to toes to abdomen to legs.

It has been good since then but I feel full even 4 to 5 hours after eating and I cannot eat as much as I previously did.,I was prescribed Prilosec for dysphagia_ but didn't have the prescription filled for over a year just avoiding the foods that gave me a problem.  I did have heartburn but not GERD and a couple of tums would take care of it.  My primary and most annoying problem was that I could not eat things like a raw apple or white rice or white chicken meat without feeling like it was stuck behind my breastbone.  I could take a couple of swallows of water and force the food down but it was uncomfortable.Prilosec has worked very well for me--ending my dysphagia as well as allowing me to eat anything without getting heartburn.  But I feel full after eating a large meal for much longer than before I took Prilosec.  Right now I have not eaten in 5 hours and it was not a particularly large meal but my stomach still feels full and I cannot eat anything else.  I wonder if this is due to the acid reduction in my stomach so the food stays in it longer before it gets digested and so I continue to feel full.  This may seem like a good thing but I am concerned about its long term negative consequences on my health.Also after having a problem with my initial doses and not taking a pill on the third day I found that Prilosec still worked perfectly well for me so I've been taking a pill every other day except today when I did not take a pill when I ordinarily would have yet it seems to still be working on the third day after taking a pill.

144, 1, chronic heartburn,Low magnesium levels leading to heart palpitations_ charley horses_ numbness and tingling in limbs_ excessive tooth decay_ severe depression and moodiness_ cloudiness in thoughts_ aching joints_ lowered immune system. I had a lot of neckaches and sore throats...all things I never even thought could be related to taking this drug until reading the comments on this website.,So_ I have taken two prescription drugs - omneprozole (for chronic heartburn) and metaprolol (for high blood pressure) for the past four years.  Interestingly_ all the above symptoms I blamed on the metaprolol because it too lowers magnesium levels and causes mood swings_ etc.  I incresed my magnesium intake to 600 mlg/ 2'xs a day and that helped with the heart palpitations and leg cramps_ but always at night I had terrible anxiety.  In addition I suffered a significant blow to my immune system.  I was sick from January - April 2014 with bronchitis_ stomach flu_ pnemonia_ laryngitis_ pink eye ----and nothing that normally works for me worked to get rid of these things.  I was beginning to wonder what was to become of me.  On top of that_ over the past four years my teeth have taken a nose-dive...suddently I have cavities upon cavities...I don't know if omneprozole is the culprit_ but having read the other comments I think it is a possiblility.  I have stopped taking it and look forward to improved health.  Oh...I took the stuff for severe chronic heartburn which it worked on fantastically.  In fact I only took the 40 mg prescribed every 3 or 4 days because it worked so well for me...but now I wonder at what cost.  I don't know if this stuff should be pulled from the market_ but more investigating needs to be done.  It can't be healthy to block stomach acid production_ I mean_ duh!

I blamed work_ social life_ living conditions_ allergies_ diet & exercise_ ect.. Turns out after radically changing my life for the better_ and removing all medicines including vitamins and non-prescriptions from my diet one by one. I was finally able to pin point the problems to Omeprazole!  Obviously my issues did not happen overnight_ but more of a gradual over time effect (staring at around the 6th month mark) until my anxiety condition was unbearable/debilitating.  Within weeks of stopping the medication_ the cloudy feeling lifted and the slight numbness to my arm and leg went away.  I am almost 2 months off the drug_ and I'm still battling with mild anxiety (no more palpitations tho)_ but the majority of side effects have faded away.  Some rebounding effects from stopping the drug cold turkey were weeks worth of inconsistent bowel movements and I have noticed I am increasingly shaky after stopping the drug. As well_ my sleep patterns are a lot more chaotic with most of the withdrawal symptoms appearing upon waking. But all in all its much easier to deal with than the full blown side effects.  Hopefully my body will balance itself out in the next few months.  A word to the wise.. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG LONG TERM!

149, 1, GERD,Anxiety_ panic attacks_ fatigue_ depression_ headaches_ joint aches_ light headed_ dizziness_ feeling of doom.,DANGER!  I am not being dramatic people!  This POISON has brought me to the point of feeling suicidal.  I was taking Zantac for years and with the advice from my doctor I added Prilosec.  Slowly this drug began to change my life.  Yes_ it did relieve the GERD I was having_ but....   I began to have pins and needles feeling in my arms and couldn't figure out why.  Fast forward a few months later I began to experience panic attacks and anxiety through the roof.  I couldn't go to any store or social event without feeling like I was going to pass out.  Being light headed became a way of life.  I scared the heck out of myself driving a few times.  I became very depressed and had daily feelings of doom and gloom.  There were days that I would wake up out of a sound sleep with a headache at the base of my neck.  Very hard to sleep at night if I even slept at all.  I have been to the doctor many times advising him of these issues and have had many tests which always come back normal.  He thinks its all in my head.  I know darn right well that I am not making this up just for the fun of it.  After many hours of researching this I have found that Prilosec causes vitamin deficiency (magnesium and B-12 to name a few).  As of yesterday 7-28-14 I have decided to stop cold turkey taking any antacids.  I am taking charge of my life and not listening to the doctors any more on this one_  I want my life back and refuse to feel like I am dying anymore.,M,51,12  months20 1X D,7/29/2014Email,Prilosec

I noticed that I had strange feelings in my chest and throat...like a lump with spasms. I was told this was Esophageal Spasms. The strange thing is_ Omeprazole is prescribed for this condition. I read online that taking a magnesium supplement can take care of spasms. I took a magnesium supplement and sure enough_ it goes away.I went to the pharmacy today and noticed that you can buy Omeprazole with Magnesium. Interesting. So_ for everyone that has been taking Omeprazole all these years WITHOUT magnesium_ consider taking it with Magnesium. The side effects could go away!Here is more regarding magnesium deficiency (You will notice that the lump in throat etc... is mentioned. Also_ anxiety is another side effect of magnesium deficiency):The first symptoms of deficiency can be subtle  as most magnesium is stored in the tissues_ leg cramps_ foot pain_ or muscle 'twitches' can be the first sign. Other early signs of deficiency include loss of appetite_ nausea_ vomiting_ fatigue_ and weakness. As magnesium deficiency worsens_ numbness_ tingling_ seizures_ personality changes_ abnormal heart rhythms_ and coronary spasms can occur.A full outline of magnesium deficiency was beautifully presented in a recent article by Dr. Sidney Baker.

162, 1, Supposedly Acid Reflux,Many side effects_ Extreme fatigue_ weakness_ heart palpitations_ anxiety_ depression_ night sweats_ lump in throat_ vitamin D deficiency_ vitamin B deficiency_ Potassium deficiency_ back pain_ hip pain_ lost weight_ lost muscle mass_ This drug is poison_ should be banned.,Side effects seem to slowly creep up_ day 1 seemed ok_ from there on I felt weak and very depressed_ by day 12 I was having heart palpitations. I went to ER and they did EKG_ blood work_ etc and told me I was fine. I had no clue that the Prilosec was causing this so I continued taking it for another 6 days. By then I finally googled it and found this site. That convinced me it was the Prilosec and I stopped taking it that day. The next day the weakness stopped_ but the other symptoms lingered. I went to my MD and she ran bloodwork and found the vitamin deficiences_ so I started taking the needed supplements and I started feeling better but I still had the heart palpitations and anxiety. So 5 weeks after stopping the prilosec I started taking St. John's Wort and within a week I started feeling much better. St. John's Wort cleans the prilosec out of your bloodstream.... I am very disappointed in FDA and Proctor and Gamble and our drs....... This has been a horrible nightmare that should have never happened.,F,55,18  days20 Mg 1X D,3/21/2014,Prilosec
163, 4, GERD,Some uneasiness and stomach irritability,Ive had GERD for the last couple of years. Two months ago I started having lump in throat feeling and last month my doctor prescribed Prilosec.  After reading comments here_ I decided not to take it what a mistake! Ive been dying every day from choking from lump in throat_ until it became unbearable. Finally_ I decided to take Prilosec. After only two doses_ lump in throat disappeared. I feel so stupid for suffering for so long_ even though I had this medication all the time_ but didnt take it because I was afraid of horrible side effects people described here.,F,44,5  days20 mg 2X D,3/20/2014,Prilosec

I then looked up all the information and from the symptoms it said I was having a rare_ severe allergic reaction and to seek medical attention. My husband is a biology major and told me to puke and take a vitiman (in case I was low on magnesium). I don't think puking helped that much cause the drug acts so fast. But it really scared me thinking I had to go to the hospital. Reading all these post has reassured me that I will be OK.

Vomiting and diahrea_ feeling of exhaustion. I hadn't had a stomach virus in over 20 years. Since Prilosec prohibits stomach acids from being released_ bad bacterias with thrive in the digestive tract and it is not unusual to get stomach viruses.

192, 1, GERD_ Acid Reflux,High Blood Pressure_ Heart Palpitations_ Anxiety_ Depression_ Uneasiness_ Lightheaded/Dizziness,I was diagnosed with GERD/Acid Reflux about 8 or 9 years ago. I was originally given Nexium.  It worked well for my reflux.  Never had any side effects.  I was switched to Prilosec for insurance reasons.  I was assured it was basically the same drug.  It worked just as well_ but there were some mild side effects at first_ but they were bearable.  I started to get very anxious and antisocial for no good reason.  I had problems concentrating at work as well.  My social and professional life was going down the tubes.  I sought prefessional mental help.  My therapist diagnosed me with anxiety and mild depression.  She suggested that I go on antidepressents.  I was prescibed Lexapro by a pychiatrist.  It worked well at first.  Over time I gained a lot of weight and got this light headed feeling all the time.  I weened off of Lexapro.  The anxiety came back but only worse along with high BP and heart palpitations.  I randomly read an article about the side effects of Prilosec that it can deplete magnesium and other nutrients on your body.  I stopped taking Prilosec and took a magnesium supplement as well as Vit B/D.  I feel so much better.  I never thought that Prilosec could be behind my anxiety issues.

Feel very unwell to the point I have been unable to do anything for myself. Absolutely no appetite either_ I've lost a stone in weight in 3 weeks!,I was prescribed these due to a low red blood cell count which my Dr put down to many years of using Diclofenac. I must stress at the point in time I was prescribed them I actually felt very well. Within 5 days I developed sore patches on my palms and ulcers in my mouth_ my GP said my hands were a type of eczema and prescribed cream. 5 days later I developed diarrhoea_ which my GP said was a bug. I came off the Prilosec for a few days_ some of my symptoms improved a little but the tummy didn't. So I stopped the diclofenac and started taking the Prilosec again. I have had such excruciating joint pain_ especially in my hands and wrists - I have wrist supports to wear as its so bad. Terrible nausea and diarrhoea_ and whole body aching. Very twitchy and unable to settle for long_ very low mood and finally yesterday vertigo. I stopped these tablets 2 days ago_ yesterday I had the worst day ever and was unable to lift my head off the pillow but today I feel a fair bit brighter. I'm hoping that over the next day or  two things will improve so I can return to work. I have also started eating again today after 3 weeks of no appetite and had my first cup of tea that I actually wanted.

I was on prescription Prilosec and Zantac but had to stop taking the Zantac because it gave me heart pains.  The Prilosec gave me very painful head zings.  My main discomfort came when I started to take O.T.C 40 mg of Prilosec.  I was slammed with dizzy spells so bad that I could not walk.  This would cause me to vomit.  The painful head zings were more intense as was my head with sensitivity to light and noise.  My body also swelled up_ particularly my head_ throat and I bloated terribly.  I had very tense muscles with severe neck pain to my shoulders.  I was constantly tired with this medication and felt horrible immediately after eating.

The breathing difficulties and anxiety_ once extremely severe_ have simmered down to an occasional feeling.  I am now sure that the previous severity was due to Prilosec making me extremely agitated and anxious - in a virtually permanent state of anxiety.  I will never take this drug or any other acid blocker or reducer as I have had negative effects from all of them.  As mentioned in my original post the Doctors said there was no way the breathing problems were due to Prilosec and told me to continue taking it.  In fact every Doctor I have talked to in regards to this problem seemed to believe it was impossible and wanted me to go on anxiety meds....not happening.

As the joint problems_ fatigue_ shortness of breath and other symptoms crept in overt the last 10 plus years_ I never put 2 and 2 together. I have had multiple surgeries to correct trigger thumb_ tennis elbows and knee issues. It was an orthopaedic surgeon that noticed my long term use of prilosec. She informed me that she has seen many patients with the same health issues as I and suggested I stop taking it for 6 months to see if my symptoms improve. I did not think they would but I did it anyway. I modified my diet and removed foods and drinks that cause heart burn and reflux. I used tums as little as possible. It was pure hell. Guess what? 6 months later I feel ten years younger. EVERY SYMPTOM has subsided. I feel so much better and so sad that I endured such depletion of my quality of life_ several unnecessary surgeries_ procedures_ injections_ missed work_ ingested more medication_ went to PT_ lost good years all because of this fucking medicine that was approved by the FDA as safe for human consumption. I wish someone would have warned me how harmful it would be to me. Maybe my review will help someone like me.,M,32,10  years 1X D,5/19/2013Email,Prilosec

We later found out that what I had was mercury posion.  So yes_ I was having some type of strange panic attacks/anxiety before taking prilosec.  I started prilosec the same day as Lexapro and had some strange crazy reactions such as no sleep_ throwing up_ cant eat or sleep.  Then was put on many different other anti depressants with the same reaction. I thought i was allergic to the anti depressants but it was really the prilosec.  I forgot to take my prilosec one day and i had no choking in my neck or nervousness.. I took it later at 4pm and by 5 pm all those crazy symptoms came back. I then had the guts to google this and found this website. I am thankful to read that others have been through this and know that i am just not crazy. I am quitting the medicine TODAY!!!

Mentioned this to my doctor_ and he told me to just go ahead and take it daily for as long as I wanted_ no problem. About 2 weeks ago I started having pain in my left chest and arm combined with dizziness/lightheadedness_ nausea_ lack of appetite. Thought I might be having a heart issue and went to the ER. Enzyme/EKG etc. came back normal_ so they sent me home. Less than 24 hours later_ I was back in the ER after having tightness/pressure feelings in my chest_ horrible anxiety_ etc. Went to sleep_ and woke up a couple hours later feeling like my heart was pounding and terribly anxious for no reason. Went through another round of tests_ again all normal. In addition to the enzyme/EKG_ this time they did a CT scan on my chest as well_ nothing doing.

Of particular concern to me was the anxiety/panic stuff_ as I've never ever experienced that before.Stopped Prilosec almost exactly 72 hours ago.

The Er ran tests and found nothing wrong_ but I did have an elevated white blood cell count. I followed up with my dr the next day and she thought my chest tightness could be from an ulcer and prescribed prilosec 40 mg once a day. I have never liked taking prescription drugs. I have taken antibiotics and pain relievers and thats about it. I figured Prilosec was an otc drug...it must be safe so I started taking it. I continued to have the chest tightness but it would come and go...after starting Prilosec I started getting weird pains in my chest( not where the heart is but kinda near my arm pits) awful headaches_ lightheadedness_ back and neck pain_ loss of appetite_ earaches and probably more that I just cant think of at the moment. I ended up back in the Er due to chest pains. After I looked up Prilosec reviews online I knew thats what was hurting me. I even stopped taking it a few days and then started taking it again to see if the side effects stopped. Of course when I mentioned this to the Er dr he said no he had never heard of Prilosec causing the symptoms I was having. They ran basically the same tests as the first time and they were normal again. That was the last day I took Prilosec and I will not take it again.

I volunteered for a cancer research project in 2010_ and one test they did was a bone-density scan. I was shocked to find I have lost over 60% of my bone mass.

A few years ago I started getting frequent sinus infections. An ENT saw me in January and said nothing was wrong_ but prescribed 20 MG omeprazole daily just to shut me up. There is a link between sinus infections and GERD_ and at first_ omeprazole was great. Slowly I started having side effects_ like my BP and glucose being higher_ plus panic attacks. The PCOS which causes my high blood sugars was in full force. Panic attacks felt like I was going to completely lose it_ where objects near me actually looked like they were slowly moving away and out of my sight_ ears ringing_ feeling like I would faint_ cold sweats. Neither the ENT or GP told me that omeprazole could cause this_ but two weeks ago I just happened to stumble across someone at work (I work in a medical clinic) who said omeprazole made her nervous. I looked it up online_ found medications and minerals may not absorb properly because of omeprazole (see the NY Times article about it for more info) AND it can also cause anxiety. I stopped omeprazole -- now my anxiety is gone_ and my BP and PCOS meds seem to be working again. But of course after only 10 days off_ the sinus irritation is already coming back. I've taken other acid reducers (NOT preventers like omeprazole) but they're not quite enough.

265, 1, Heartburn,"I had a near fatal allergic reaction to Prilosec around six years ago.   My experience may have been atypical:  I took Prilosec as recommended (and successfully) for an initial 14 day course.   Then_ my heartburn gradually came back_ but I decided not to do another round of treatment.   Instead_ I took a prilosec one night when I had run out of rolaids.  I became very ill_ but did not associate it with the Prilosec.  I actually took Prilosec three times more (with increasingly worse reactions each time) before I figured out what was making me sick.   The final time I almost died.  Ironically_ I started having heart arrhythmia simultaneously with the final - worst - reaction.  I have no idea of my ongoing arrhythmia has anything to do with the Prilosec but I came very close to dying from this OTC drug.  My initial allergic reactions were severe stomach pain_ vomiting and diarrhea.  It wasn't until the fourth reaction that I had ""classic"" allergic symptoms - hives_ constricted",My husband has now (regular Prilosec user) developed persistent Atrial Fibrillation.

When I was off it_ I had to compensate with severe diet (sort of helped - maybe 20% relief)_ but constant otc heartburn relievers - up to 10 a day.  I felt depressed_ looked pale - felt like I was someone else - just a bad overall feeling.  The day I went back on it_ it all went away and I feel great - sorry for others' reactions_ but for me_ it's a Godsend.  Once I've been on it for awhile_ plan on taking every other day_ as I have been for the past several years - seems just right this way - taking everyday for a long period of time gave me some mild stomach pain - taking every other day_ as I said_ works just right (for me).,,M,47,10  years20mg 1X D,5/27/2012Email,Prilosec

Dont like this drug. Why they think any medication is totally safe. It stops your stomach acid. It inhibits absorption of vitamins/minerals_ and calcium and can cause hip_wrist fractures. How about just plain dietary changes such as stop sodas_ caffeine_ chocolate_ and meds such as aspirin and nsaids which can cause stomach bleeding. These are common culprits.

It has been shown that prilosec (and other PPI drugs) inhibit magnesium uptake and so probably what many of us are experiencing is magnesium deficiency from prolonged use of prilosec. Healthy heart and nerve function require magnesium. I stopped taking prilosec and just started taking a daily magnesium supplement (500 mg magnesium oxide_ from Rite-Aid drugstore) and I'm already starting to feel better.

I tried over the counter Prilosec and found it not as effective with unpleasant side effects. The only drawback I have found is that when taking it you can eat anything (and hence may gain weight)_ but if you decide to stop taking it you must ease off it slowly over a long period_ only with the OK of your MD_ and have to avoid food_ drink_ and pills that cause reflux.,M,60,7  years20 1X D,3/27/2012Email,Prilosec

302, 1, Supposed GERD,Extreme anxiety_ restlessness_ headache_ brain fog (out of body/dream like feeling),"I went to the doctor of have a strange lump in my throat feeling for 6 days that came on out of nowhere. I did tons of research before I went in_ so I knew what the doctor would say: GERD. It's actually quite possible as I have recurring heartburn and don't seem to have any other symptoms of illnesses that might cause the lump. The doctor referred me to the Gastro Clinic and prescribed Prilosec. I'm extremely wary of taking meds and sensitive to them_ so I asked both him and the pharmacist about possible side effects. Both said almost none_ maybe calcium loss over long term. Decided to give it a try because this ""lump"" is horrible. Took my first pill this morning and within 15 minutes I felt terrible. Started out feeling really foggy headed and out of it_ almost like I was high or in a dream. Then started getting really bad anxiety_ which made me extremely restless. Headache came at the same time. All day have been feeling bad_ and will never be taking this again. I knew immediately it was the prilosec (actually the generic version)_ and looked online to find this website_ and many others with the same symptoms_ or worse! I know a lot of people tolerate it just fine_ but they need to revise their side effect list because obviously a LOT of people have problems with it and don't know it's the prilosec causing it! I am restricting my diet_ and going with natural remedies (apple cider vinegar and ginger or fennel) until I see the GI Clinic. Still have the lump but it's",F,32,1  days20mg 1X D,1/28/2012Email,Prilosec

But when I stopped taking it the reflux didn't immediately disappear so my doctor prescribed omeprazole 20mg_ saying if it didn't work I'd have to have an endoscopy and there might be something serious! Frightened me to death - and the drug didn't work. Went back 3 times and was told by another doctor to double the dose_ so now on 40mg. Symptoms are worse_ much worse. Now got blurred vision. Got a gastroenterology appointment in hospital in a few days_ and I'm afraid to stop taking it until I've seen a specialist_ so will reduce the dose and then see what happens.,F,69,2  months20 mg 2X D,1/27/2012Email,Prilosec

306, 3, Acid reflux,I'm sitting on the fence about this medication at the moment. There is no doubt that my stomach feels MUCH better than it did 9 months ago but there are definitely side effects_ some of which I'm only starting to link to the drug. I'm constantly exhausted & have become really forgetful (but do have a stressful job so unsure of linked!). I also sometimes feels really nauseous_ even more so than before I started taking the meds. Also_ pain underneath left rib cage_ numbness in fingers_ vertigo (all only occasionally) and started developing facial hair on one side. Also head & neck ache. It's hard to say whether any or all of these symptoms are linked to Prilosec but after reading some of these reviews I'm starting to think I might be better off just suffering from the pain of acid reflux!?!,,F,31,9  months,1/24/2012,Prilosec

Dr's either don't realize it or know it and 1- don't want to believe it or 2- don't want to admit it because it's all about money with Dr's and pharm companies. Not human life. Sadly_ but so true. I tried telling all my Dr's all these things I was experiencing was from Prilosec. They all said no. No way. It's something else. And so I wasted tons of money on MRI's CT scans blood work ultrasounds etc....ALL were normal. So_ it's not the drug? Really! I was fine before I took the drug. NEVER had ANY of these symptoms. I wasted almost a yr of my life being sick FROM this drug. I am in the process of slowly coming off of it. You cannot just cold turkey stop it. No way! You will become very sick if you do. Acid-rebound is terrible. And that among many other issues if you do stop cold turkey. I will eventually pursue legal advice against Prilosec. And fight hard to get it off the market.

They are so bad they totally disrupt my life and I have never had headaches quite like these_ I'm sick all day and night and then a whole day after to recover from that. So I've been off the Prilosec for about ten days now and so far no headache but it's too early to tell but will keep updating as time goes by_ whatever happens.I am still having the numbness in fingers and toes and since that involves circulation and vascular issues it may be awhile to determine what that is about.

I'm off the wedge pillow & laying flat again which is helping relieve my back & hip problems.

I was also coming off of another medicine that I didn't need to take anymore because I wasn't having anymore pains with my gallbladder (Ultram  AKA Tramadol).  I thought it was due to that.  And after being weary of the side effects of coming off the Tramadol_ I realized I hadn't done my research on Prilosec.  I see now that the Tingling in my hands and feet are due to the Prilosec depleating my body of B12.  Although I have been taking 1000MG of B12 for the past 3 days_ it obviously hasn't put enough in my body.  Unfortunately I had already taken my daily pill before looking here.

Ever since then which is the same time I started the medication_ I have not felt good.  It feels like it has been one thing after another.  I have always been a very energetic person in great health_ so this was of great concern to me.  I went to my primary care  and bloodwork and CT scan were normal. Went to a chiro for my muscle tension and got a massage weekly_ it did not help. Went to GI and got endoscopy_ results came back as slight esophagitis. I can't seem to figure out what is causing me to feel terrible. Prilosec did stop most of my gerd symptoms_ but these new symptoms have me feeling helpless.

My gastro doctor recommended I take this medicine after I was experience frequent heartburn.  He said that I could take it indefinitely. Two weeks in I had severe leg pains to the point where I could barely walk or bend my legs. When I would sit/lay down the pain would shoot through my legs.  I went to my primary care physician the pain was so bad. I thought I had a blood clot.  My legs were checked (no blood clot).  I also had bloodwork done and the lab results said I was Vitamin D deficient.  Never been deficient in any vitamin before.  Ok so I started taking Vitamin D supplements.  Felt a little better.  I missed taking my Prilosec a couple days and felt great.  Didnt realize there was a connection.  Started taking prilosec again (for 2 days).  Experienced severe fatigue and leg pain & depression.  Returned to primary care doctor and got another scan of my leg to check for a blood clot.  Nothing found.  Found this website.  It all makes sense now.  Will never take Prilosec again.

Unfortunately she went from being a fun loving little girl to a depressed child with what she called ""bad thoughts"" every single day. She actually even had suicidal thoughts as well as some very_very evil ones. This was so out of character for her that I was so scared myself trying to figure out what happened and why this was happening to her. Two days ago I got online before I gave her her 7:00am pill to try to find some kind of answer_ and right there in front of me was account after account of many others with the same side effects. She also experienced dizziness_ tingling of the face_ headaches_ but these were all minor compared to her pityful torturous thoughts that she would have.

364, 3, Ulcer/GERD,Belching/Depression/Mental Slowness/Heightened Anxiety,The first 1 1/2 weeks of taking Prilosec_ I felt better.  My MD prescribed 2 doses of 20 mg per day_ and the one day I took both doses_ I felt a major mental slow down.  I had to focus to remember what my train of thought was just 10 minutes prior.  After about 12 days of the medicine_ I had a MAJOR panic attack to the point that I refused to go out in public with friends.  Before starting Prilosec_ I had anxiety_ but NEVER to the point of crying and refusing to go out.  1 week later I stopped Prilosec_ and I had a major LOW mood swing.  I started up on Prilosec a few days later because I had severe intestinal pain_ but by Friday I once again felt some anxiety and depression with what I refer to as hyperactive thinking - I just kept thinking of things that upset me and gave me anxiety.  I seriously thought I was going crazy... Then I realized I never had it this bad before.  So this last Monday was the last time I took Prilosec because about 3 hours later I had mini panic attacks for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON.  I'm not certain that the medication is causing it - but it is definitely exacerbating any issues I've had in the past_ and I shouldn't have to deal with it if I don't have to.  I have now been off of Prilosec for 3 days_ and while I've still had major mood swings (mostly LOW swings)_ I feel like I am getting better.

Prilosec makes you vitamin deficient (b12 specially ) so thats where the hair loss comes from. The hair loss is NOT permanent. My body hairs have got completely back to normal. My head is slowly getting thicker. I am taking suplements and trying to eat as healthy as I can to get my body back to normal. This drug is poison and I wish I never took it. I wonder what damage it done to the rest of my body. I had bruises for no reason while taking this drug+ 6 months after I stopped taking it. I havent had a bruise in a couple of months now. My hair is slowly falling out less and less. My scalp doesnt itch as much. So_ dont panic if your hair continues to fall out for months after you stop prilosec_ It will grow back as soon as your vitamin levels get back to normal (:,F,25,9  months 1X D,9/11/2011Email,Prilosec

In hindsight_ I was having smaller episodes over the course of the year__ which i couldn't figure out. All my tests have been normal. Dr. wants me to get MRI _ mentioned MS. Recently I was on a trip with some very good friends_ and had another episode....basically a panic attack with all those symptoms.My friend told me about her husband's reaction to Prilosec.For him she said his overall personality changed. He stopped taking it_ and got back to normal. It never occured to me that it could be this drug. But it's too coincidental to see so many people with the SAME EXACT symptoms as me. Today is day 4 without it. Wondering how long it will take to really feel 'normal' again.& I love how these Dr.s like to hand out prescriptions for Xanax because you come into their office_ and start crying like you are out of your mind! It is such a helpless feeling!All they want to do is mask the symptoms_ and don't really care about finding the problem.",F,41,3  months20mg-40mg 1X D,6/28/2011Email,Prilosec

398, 1, Gastritis,I saw my doctor because of extreme digestion problems and was prescribed omeprazole 20mg 2xdaily.  I was having various dental procedures done over about a four-month period.  I periodically felt better but experienced recurrences of gastritis.  After the bouts stopped_ I discontinued the omeprazole.  In a few days (which I did not connect to stoppage at the time) I became very ill with bad flu-like symptoms_ faintness_ etc._ which increased daily.  Doctors could find nothing wrong which I found very insulting.  For some reason I took an omeprazole and felt better within 20 minutes.  I then had another dental problem_ taking OTC benzocaine on the tooth.  Had to call an ambulance due to extreme spike in BP and pulse (210/120-110p).  After some thought_ I realized that all along I had been sensitive to the carbocane and topical benzocaine_ which had caused the gastritis.  Again_ I quit the omeprazole and became very ill.  Going online I found that so many others were unable to quit this,"I went to the doctor with this information and was told to cut back to one 20mg dose per day for two weeks_ then to one every other day.  By the tenth day on one_ I had crippling muscle aches_ stomach aches_ HPB_ and had to once again call an ambulance for what I guess was a severe panic attack.  Doctor told me to go back to 20mg 2xday.  I asked for a referral to a gastroenterologist because I am by now getting sick from the drug on an almost daily basis.  I attribute my crippling hip arthritis (onset after beginning drug)_ bloating so bad I think I will explode_ inability to get sufficient air_ tinnitus_ confusion and many other like symptoms experienced by other respondents.  Guess what the GE doctor told me when I told him I couldn't get off the drug and wanted to for my health and my sanity.  He said_ ""Get used to it""(!!)

I had a bad bout of acid reflux after vacation so I started taking it everyday and on some days twice (which my doc said was safe) I started having heart palpitations every 5 to 10 minutes for 3 days and I was petrified. I am 37 in great health_ eat well_ exercise and have no history of heart disease. I didn't go to the ER because I really couldn't believe i was having a heart attack.  I saw my doctor on Monday and she said maybe anxiety or too much coffee. She kinda looked at me like I was nuts considering. She told me to see a cardiologist anyway to be safe and before I could get in to see them I stumbled across this website. Prilosec was the only medication I was taking. Thank you everyone for posting your similar issues with this drug. I stopped taking it and have not had a problem since. I still can't believe that a medication for  heartburn could have such serious side effects.

I have finally kicked the drug and some symptoms have started to fade. I'll go back to a life of tums and eating right. Heartburn has nothing on the hell I've been going through.

DON'T DO IT.  my life has seriously totally changed for the worse ever since i took this crap.  doctors are drug pushers.. this stuff should be meant if ONLY if you have bleeding ulcers or serious issues.,i was told to start taking this since my stomach had a burning feeling.  they told me to take for 2 months.  i noticed after a week of taking it i started to burp after drinking water_ something i never experienced before in my life.  the burning stopped and i was seemingly fine again.  but 3 weeks later i had to start taking again because i irriated my stomach by taking an advil (with food).  i was on it for months since the burning didnt go away and i was constantly burping.  i've been off it since and weened down to zantac but i dont think my digestive system will ever work well again because this medicine literally turns off your digestive juices.

454, 4, Gastritis causing extreme hunger,Joint pain for the first couple of weeks. Random testicular pain after around 2 weeks. After 3 weeks or so_ I develop neck discomfort that feels like a knot in my neck. My stool generally becomes looser.,First off_ the medicine works extremely well for blocking acid production. The question is whether the side effects are worth it for you. Acid in my stomach was causing extreme hunger and lightheadedness due (my doctor thinks) to gastritis. This medication stopped the acid and therefore the hunger outright. The side effects I had were bearable_ except the neck pain. The neck pain became so bad that I had to drop from 40 to 20 MG in order to bear it. I have taken Omeprazole off and on for the last 2 years (8 weeks at a time at the most) and it gives me the same side effects every time. Likewise_ when I stop the medication_ the side effects go away after around 7 - 10 days. I will be trying AciPhex next_ if my hunger attacks return.,M,38,2  years20 - 40 MG 1X D,3/2/2011Email,Prilosec

My blood pressure has return to normal for most of the time with occasional bouts of high BP in wich I feel my entire body pulsing.  I still get shortness of breath every once in a while (once a day maybe) where I require some deep breathes but it's are much much better than before.  Still afraid to push myself too hard physically.  During my sufferings I was in and out of the hospital 7-8 times.  Had my heart checked out completely and it was fine.  DO NOT TAKE THIS POISON!.  If you are nieve and end up ingesting this poison_ go to your local health food store and pick up some St. John's Wort.  The reason you are feeling so bad is because you body cannot eliminate the Prilosec from your system.  SJW has been clinically shown to eliminate the omeprazole from your bloodstream.

Very odd.,I am a very healthy guy and at the beginning of January experienced some GERD symptoms - chest pain. I had experienced this a few years ago so I knew what it was_ but this time it was worse than before. I started taking prilosec OTC 20mg/day and it helped a little. After about a week I called my doctor since the symptoms weren't completely gone and he recommended increasing it to 40mg. The first day was great - no GERD. The following days_ though_ I had this odd feeling of anxiety and flu-like symptoms. It was weird. I thought maybe the dose was too high so I decreased to 20mg/day but the side effects continued. Finally_ I decided to stop it all together. That was about 72 hours ago. I noticed a difference pretty quickly. The side effects gradually lessened and right now I feel back to normal.

My Dr again prescribed 20MG and i have not picked up the medicine since i dont want to eat it..Although i have started taking Manuka honey to feel better and adjusted my diet to more green veggies_ fruits etc.,Not a good drug_ it will reduce all acid in your stomach and you wont be able to digest the food.Once you get off the drug acid will come back ad you will be Ok.,M,38,30  days 1X D,1/12/2011Email,Prilosec

486, 1, acid reflux disease,pain in all parts of body_ restless leg syndrome_ weakness_ shortness of breath_ low immunity_ possibly contributed to food poisoning.,I've been addicted to this drug for over 13 years due to my gastro prescribing Nexium at 40 mg per day_ and any time I try to stop_ get severe heartbearn. (The drug might be fine for the 14 days it is intended.)  I am currently trying to wean myself off slowly_ since cold turkey is impossible.  I tried cold turkey recently_ and after a few weeks developed a constant cough from acid apparently backing up into my trachea or lungs.  I realized that my aches and pains were caused by prilosec when I stopped taking it and became completely pain free.  The pain returned when I started taking it again.  I also think my five day stay in the hospital for food posining may have been caused by the lack of acid to destroy the bacteria. I have had other problems_ but have no way of knowing if related to taking prilosec.  I would not recommend getting addicted to this drug.,F,48,13  years20.6 mg 1X D,1/4/2011Email,Prilosec

489, 3, acid reflux,harder bowls,I think this works on the SYMPTOMs rather than the CAUSE.  My reflux is caused because the stomache doesn't close properly.  So rather than fixing that_ they shut-off the acid pumps in my stomache.  Food doesn't digest properly_ my stool is harder_ and now I've had to have surgery to remove severe hemorroids.  But prior to Prilosec_ I was taking probably 18 Tums per day (3 at a time about 6 times a day) for 15 years.  Now it's just one Prilosec in the morning and I am reflux-free...with the few exceptions--which are worse than anything I've ever had before!  I wake up and it's all the way up into my sinus cavity!

So many sinus infections_ so much pain and fatigue_ and so many people thinking i'm just living an ""unhealthy lifestyle.""  Turns out I have a severe vitamin D deficiency as well as an IgA deficiency_ an autoimmune disorder that's fairly common but i am completely DEPLETE of this.  I discovered this because the doctor did a celiac sprue test_ which is supposed to react with IgA_ so she tested those levels along with it to make sure it wasn't a false negative.  I am wondering if that is something also connected to PPI's?  I have had a lot of Sinus infections over the last 20 years. People_ listen up: You can eat more of the crappy food you want to and feel less heartburn_ but the end result of my years of feeling like crap and not knowing why: IT'S NOT WORTH IT! All the symptoms I listed are very_ very real_ and can temporarily feel better with diet_ excessive sleep and exercise_ but they do not go away!  Today I have taken my last PPI_ EVER!

I went back for a check up_ he did another scope and said all was fine and released me_ without any instructions about the meds. So when I went to my regular Dr I asked for a script  for it. Dumb.

523, 2, Heartburn_ acid reflux,Toward the end of my 6 months taking Prilosec I began having soreness in my neck and occaisional pain in the back lower area of my head.  I kept feeling like I had to stretch my neck from side to side and if I may say so I had the unsubstantiated perception that blood flow in the vessels of my neck was decreasing.  It was just a feeling.  I went to the doctor who did a physical exam and listened for telltale blockage and he said he found none.  I stopped taking Prilosec and the feeling went away though my strong acid production returned.  I have decided to be more conscientious about when_ what_ and how much I eat and have started taking some papaya enzyme tablets to aid digestion.,Prilosec worked well at profoundly reducing my acid production but in doing so I would have to say that I stopped paying attention to the quality of my diet and other factors that contribute to acid reflux.  I am glad to be off it and transitioning to a better diet.  The two things I feel are most important to combat acid reflux are eating a probiotic diet with kefir/yogurt regularly and walking.  Walking promotes regularity and I perceive that my acid reflux was always worse during sedentary periods.  Think of it in pure plumbing terms.  You must keep things flowing to prevent backups.,M,40,6  months 1X D,11/10/2010,Prilosec

Minor activity such as buckling my daughters child seat caused muscle burn like you would get from a workout.  Standing still for more than a minute caused legs to tire. Had severe pain and tightness in both trapezius muscles (from neck to shoulder)_ the right side disappeared completely after one day the left side after two.  Not a residual pain that disappears over a week from normal muscle strain.  Chewy foods caused muscles in back of neck to fatigue and tire. Right calf remained cramped for weeks.  Two different Internal Med docs ran blood tests_ abdominal ultra sounds_ and Chest X-rays and all were NEG.  Stopped Prilosec for 1 week symptoms except calf cramp disappeared.

I've tried other PPI's with the same result.,Every doc I've talked to about this has said they've never heard of the side effect. After reviewing the ratings on this site_ I somehow doubt that it's all that rare. Someone is withholding reaction information from the appropriate entities about this class of drug. They're either discounting it as some sort of emotional problem or they just don't care or haven't made the connection. I don't even have a guess as to why it would make some people depressed_ but I strongly believe it happens.,M,27,60  days20mg 1X D,10/30/2010,Prilosec

Having never had any anxiety issues in the past went to being obsessed that I was dying. Really sore collarbone pains and a lump at the back of the throat. Breakthrough acid happened and was advised to double up dose (was on 20mg for 5 weeks) Have just started weaning myself off with Zantac_ DGL and Aloe Vera Juice,Only consider it as a last resort and MAKE sure you do your homework before looking at any PPI. They are needed for many and work for many but are hard to come off and will screw your insides to bits if you shouldnt be on them. If you get any breakthrough acid dont double up instead insist on further investigation.

I didn't even know my stomach was in a poor state_ I just foolishly and naively trusted my doctor.  He originally placed me on 1 capsule a day_ and then upped the dosage to one capsule prior to every meal.  Again_ I thought the doctor knew what he was doing_ and I followed suit.    About 8 months or so into the treatment_ I started having severe hair loss and fatigue.  I would wake up with my hair all over my pillow and not even enough energy to get out of bed.  I chalked it up to the flu or something and continued on my normal way.  I had had minor episodes of depression before_ but I didn't realize I was slowly slipping into a deep depression that almost cost me my job and put me a year behind in school.I hate pharmaceutical companies for making this drug and my gastro for so wrecklessly prescribing it.  I lost a year and half of my life and I worry about any permanent side-effects this drug may have caused me_ not to mention the large bald spot on my head at 25.,M,25,1.5  years20 mg 3X D,10/28/2010Email,Prilosec

After 2 weeks I see no difference in my mucus production or my cough. After experiencing these side effects (thinking I was imagining them) and finding this website_ I told my doctor that I'm stopping the medication as of today.  I live a very healthy lifestyle_ am an avid runner and eat well.  Id rather live with this cough than the side effects of this drug.  Also_ Im a private pilot and fly a few times a week.

540, 2, Chronic stomach upset_ pain,Numbness in fingers and feet_ weakness in legs_ twitching in face and lips_ anxiety_ heart palpitations_ mental dysfunction,I began taking the generic Omeprazole in an attempt to control the stomach upset which was possibly generated by post nasal drip secretions.  Strange effects began immediately.  First_ I noticed a weakness in my legs_ particularly my right_ while descending stairs. This later became constant_ with the bottom of my right foot going nearly numb_ becoming tingly.  Fingers and thumb on my right hand began to exhibit similar properties.  Fingers on my left hand followed.  I began to become very concerned as time went on and these problems continued and intensified.  I began to think I had a neurological condition_ such as multiple sclerosis. I was informed by a friend (nurse) that these might be a side-effects of Prilosec and began to research this_ finally stumbling upon this site.  I ceased ingestion of omeprazole about 35 hours ago.  These were the most unbelievable side effects I've ever experienced.  They are thankfully decreasing in intensity and I hope to be (neurologically) back to normal soon.  Concluding that omeprazole is a converted Soviet nerve agent. Advise against administration/ingestion.,M,31,7  days20mg 1X D,10/11/2010Email,Prilosec

Instead_ just eat healthy_ exercise and quit bad habits like drinking_ smoking_ drugs etc. I first got panic attacks 11 years ago when I just started this drug and it has been a straight ride to hell ever since. There are so many side effects it is ridiculous. Basically what is happening is your body is not allowed to digest foods in its normal way and give you the most severe_ chronic constipation one can get eventually. Since digestion is halted the normal vitamins cannot be absorbed leading to mental illness and sicknesses. Even after 11 years I stopped after finding this site and things are slowly going back to normal. I was dying before. Even made out a last will and testament. With my experience I would not even use this death drug under any circumstance. I don't care what your doctor says. I got 11 years experience with taking this drug that he/she does not. I also know what it is like to get off it. The acid really sucks at the start but it is worth it. Your mental issues and symptoms will soon go away if they are tied to this drug.,M,39,11  years30 1X D,9/26/2010,Prilosec

This included urinary incontinence_ glazed dead eyes_ and the inability to get back up for up to half an hour. I hit my head on various things several times. I went through an incredible array of testing on three separate occasions_ and was told I was having panic attacks because blood tests on one occasion showed high fight or flight results. After three years of this I overheard a person telling a friend about the terrible year he'd had that included passing out and hitting his head several times.  I butted into the conversation and learned that his GP believed he'd been experiencing anaphylactic shock events_ and that he fairly quickly came to the conclusion that another PPI was the culprit. The shock could explain the high catecholamine readings I believe. Anyway_ shock or not_ I quit Prilosec immediately three weeks ago and started feeling better within a couple of days. I've lost weight_ wake feeling incredibly rested_ have lost the urinary urgency that was driving me nuts_ and haven't had the cold sweat events that were occurring daily for almost three years.

Then I read that you can get a prescription for 10 mg and I wanted to try it at a lower dose. Unbelievable huh? The over the counter medicine is 20 mg_ but you need a prescription for the 10 mg. I asked my dr to presribe this as we all know ""one size doesn't fit all."" I have been on 10mg for just 2 days and my Gerd has not been back. Maybe others should ask their dr to go on a lower dose?

I can't begin to understand why it is approved by the FDA_ (aren't they suppose to protect us) when the side effects caused by this drug EXTREAMELY OUT WEIGH the slight relief of heartburn..  I now know that I need to go with my intuition and believe in my body.  It had been telling me for 5 years that something was really wrong_ I just thought that it was part of growing older and gaining a little weight.  So Not True.I hope that by writing this comment_ I can possibly spare anyone else the painful experience.Shame_ Shame_ Proctor & Gamble..Sincerely_ Bobbi,F,44,5  years20.6 1X D,8/29/2010Email,Prilosec
572, 1, Thought I had acid reflux/gastritis,Increased GI problems_ increased anxiety/depression,I'm sure this drug is fine for those who actually have upper GI/acid problems.  However_ there needs to be more information out there with regards to its effect on mental health.  To all of those experiencing anxiety/depression and all of the related symptoms (panic attacks_ chest pains_ numbness/tingling_ tinnitus_ heart palpitations_ high blood pressure_ insomnia_ night sweats_ vivid dreams_ brain fog_ nausea_ dizziness_ the list goes on..) please consider that we as a society are on the verge of a mental health crisis. You may be experiencing upper GI distress as a direct result of teetering on the edge of depression. Taking this medication reduces your body's ability to absorb nutrients (particularly B-complex vitamins) that it uses to synthesize the chemicals in your brain.  As a result_ you can very quickly slip into a deep depression that you might have otherwise avoided. I know this is hard to accept for some people. (There is no shame in depression.  It's a chemical imbalance in your brain and it happens to nearly everyone at some point. Unfortunately it also compromises our ability to think clearly about our health among other things.) My experience was over a year ago. It took me 3 months to accept that it was depression/anxiety and nearly a year to recover.  If you are interested in hearing more about my experience_ feel free to email. Otherwise_ please consider this as a possible explanation to what you are experiencing and talk to your doctor/therapist about it.,M,35,7  days20MG 1X D,8/27/2010Email,Prilosec
573, 1, I'm not taking it,Never experienced any because I refused to take it.,"While in the hospital_ a nurse brought a Prilosec pill for me to take.  I asked her why I should take it_ I didn't have heartburn.  She said_ get this_ ""It will help you absorb your food better.""  That sounded crazy to me_ so I refused to take it.  On my discharge papers_ they wrote that I was to take Prilosec once a day.  I will never take a proton pump inhibitor.  I've been hearing about their side effects for years.  I don't know why anyone would take them. Tums will always help if i ever get a rare heartburn.",F,68,0  days0 1X D,8/26/2010,Prilosec

575, 4, acid reflux,A lump in my throat- I thought it was some kind of tumor because I am a professional singer. The omeperazole/prilosec DID help amazingly! I drink wine and that seemed to cause the acid reflux just suddenly about 6 months ago. I would take a pill 20 minutes BEFORe wine and VOILA! all was fine from the miserable previous effects of acid reflux- burning esophagus_ nausea feeling and stomach cramps. If the doctor just TOLD ME- the trade off is-- acid reflux gone BUT you will experience a lump or tumor feeling in your throat- then I WOULD KNOW and not experience great anxiety thinking my throat may be swelling and I would sufficate and die if I do NOT go to ER or that I may have polyps due to singing _ etc! It is the NOT knowing that causes great problems- PLEASE advise patient specifically and correctly- LUMP in throat_ dry skin and dehydration IF you take this pill and if you don't then suffer acid reflux or delete specific items from your diet- simple and exact and no trip to ER! Oh and,The drug DID remove my acid reflux immediately upon taking just one 20 mg pill; but the lump in throat would appear maybe 6 to 24 hours later and dry skin in hands/appendages was quite severe since I already have dry skin. Dehydration also occurred and diarrreaha (sp?)  but did not know all 4 were related until I came to this website. Thanks!,F,42,5  days20 mg 1X AN,8/25/2010EmailHistory,Prilosec

I am a 23 year old college student who eats healthy_ exercises every other day_ doesn't smoke_ and doesn't eat salty foods so you can understand how surprised I was for this to happen.  The first two days of taking Prilosec were great.  My gastritis was gone and my spirits were up.  By the third day I began to feel weakness in my knees and pain deep in my arms and legs where my veins were.  Then on the fourth night I came very close to having a stroke.  I couldn't check my B/P at the time but all the veins in my neck were protruding and my heart felt as if it was gonna explode.  I went to the doctor's the next day and my b/p was 180/140!  I have been to multiple doctors_ emergency rooms_ and even my psychiatrist since and they all say it is the same thing: anxiety. This infuriates me.  I stopped taking Prilosec OTC 42 hours ago and expected to be back to normal by now but my blood pressure is still through the roof (anywhere between 160/95 - 140/110) and am now worried I have done permanent harm to my cardiovascular system.

583, 1, LPR/GERD,SEVERE ANXIETY.  Insomnia.  Depression.  Headaches.  Constantly feeling dehydrated.,"When I was first prescribed this I felt like it was a miracle drug.  It made the constant lump in my throat (caused by LPR/GERD) disappear_ which helped lower my anxiety levels (I already had pre-existing generalized anxiety disorder).  Looking back_ I'm not entirely sure when the anxiety started to get worse - but I know that after being on the medication for 1 month (Fourth of July weekend) I was already feeling incredibly anxious.  It got to the point where I was unable to go to work because I was having near constant panic attacks and I missed nearly a full week of work_ not to mention taking a lot of 1/2 days. I made an ""emergency"" appointment at my regular doctor_ who did a full battery of blood work (all fine) and - on top of prescribing me stronger anti-anxiety medications and recommending a therapist - advised I stopped taking the Prilosec because ""I probably didn't need it"".  After 1 week of not being on it I noticed a drastic difference in my anxiety level.  I had gone from literally thinking I was dying and almost hoping my parents would have me committed_ to feeling normal.  It's been about 3 weeks since I've been off the drug and although my LPR/GERD is back in action_ my anxiety level is next to nothing and I'm able to sleep and eat without feeling like the world is ending.

So I said if they are pellets in capsules they can be weighed! :) So I did a search on digital scale .001 gram accuracy (accuracy down to the milligram) - and there they were. Now I could weigh the omeprazole pellets_ take that number in grams and multiply it by .75 (75% dose) for a 15 gram dose! The same applies for a 10 mg (50%) or 5 mg (25 %) dose_ etc...I wanted to be sure I got enough accuracy in milligrams with these digital scales. The ones I liked were in the $150-300 price range (which can pretty much give accurate enough readings). These scales may be a little pricey_ but to me would be a tremendous bargain if they could help get me off this drug. As for weighing the omeprazole pellets_ just trim a clean square piece of paper (or wax paper) to fit on the weighing tray_ also fold the paper in half (for dispensing). Then just put your 75% or whatever dose on a tablespoon of applesauce and take with a glass of water! :)Another alternative to using a digital scale is to sort the pellets on a mirror or flat surface carefully with a razor blade into halves or quarters. I'm not sure how accurate this would be if done by eye_ or if the linearity of the digital scales would be better at low milligram measures...I hope this helps everyone as much as I think it should he",M,53,8  months20 mg 1X D,7/24/2010,Prilosec

596, 5, Almost constant  nausea,I have had no side effects.  I started taking a generic form of Prilosec after several weeks of nausea.  I was miserable for a little over 6 weeks_ feeling nauseous every day at some point_ but I knew I was not pregnant.  After trying Tums and Mylanta with no relief my dad suggested Prilosec.  After just a few days I was back to normal_ able to eat whatever I wanted again_ go to work without issues_ and just live my life again.  About once a day I do feel a weird feeling in my stomach for a few seconds followed by hunger_ but that is it.  I don't know if it is from the Prilosec or if it is just my bodies way of telling me I'm hungry now.  Prilosec really did help give me my life back.  I also make sure to eat a little something every few hours or whenever I feel hungry_ because I learned that eating a few pretzels and drinking some water or drinking warm ginger ale really helped my stomach too.,My dad has been using Prilosec for 10 years now without any problems.  I will continue to use it as long as I feel I need it.  I have had no problems since I started taking it almost a year ago.  I also find that if you have nausea_ drink a glass of red wine.  It really does help to first calm you_ but also settle your stomach.  I also drank warm ginger ale and would eat a little to help with the nausea.  Usually if you eat something small when you start to feel nauseous it does make it go away.

625, 2, acid reflux,,I started taking Prpilosec OTC about 6 months ago to control  occasional acid reflux because I noticed there seemed to be a relationship between acid reflux and my atrial fibrillation episodes. It controlled the acid relux very well so I continued to take it.  Recently I noticed some swelling in my ankles_ then started experiencing some joint pain.  Last week I started having some severe stomach pain_ headaches_ and extreme fatigue which would start in the morning and last until evening when it would finally abate but would recur again the next morning.  It suddenly occurred to me that there might be a relationship between taking Prilosec (which I always took in the morning upon rising) and the fatigue I was experiencing.  I stopped the Prilosec and immediately the fatigue was gone and soon I didn't have the joint pain either.  However_ the stomach pain was worse than I have ever experienced in the past.

Have your doctor look up the side effects of both and he will then see you are not crazy. A good one to check out is Drugs.com as it covers both professional and patient information. I also had a lump in my throat and pain in my ears_ dizziness_ mouth pain_ headache_ stiff neck_ eye pain and heaviness_ weakness legs which is a numb feeling and my arm and throat felt numb.

They called it Atrial Fibrilation.It came out of no where... usually on a hot day after a cold drink. From then_ palpitations. Difficulty breathing on a plane_ or at night( infrequently). Systemic joint paint that had me wondering what was wrong with me. It was bilateral_ started at the ankles and traveled upward. The last koints to hurt were the wrists and fingers. Restless leg syndrome at night. 3 years ago I began to get eye pressure and right eye blurred vision. Then pressure under the eye and later headaches.. that I never had before. All these symptoms started AFTER taking ONLY this med.,I have been taking this medicine for 12 years. This drug WORKS! BUT...I have tried to stop. It was impossible. The fire is so intense that I was forced to RUN back to the drug. The rebound can NOT be understated. It is horrific. I started to get symptoms almost immediately when I first tried this medicine. I also felt anxiety from the first  week.I asked my  Medical Physician if anxiety was a side effect.. he said no.I doubted him. I work out 5 days a week hard.. and this manages the smptoms I would get from acid. However_ I started to get joint pain that was unexplained_ blurry eye vision that would last for hours_ headaches_ palpitations_ restless leg syndrome and other unexplained symptoms. I have had EVERY test...body scan.. NORMAL_ MRI of the brain.. NORMAL.. 3 gastric scopes and 1 colonoscope.. Normal_ CT scan of the sinus cavities of the head.. and more. ALL NORMAL. How can all be normal and have all these side effects?? Where are they coming from? I don't do drugs. I don't smoke. I workout at a high level for 37 years. I want to wean off this drug.. but the rebound is unreal. Anyone who can help let me know.

654, 2, Acid Reflux,Heart palpitations,I've been having acid reflux problems since my 20s.  Been to the ER twice for chest pain.  Took this for a month on advice from my doctor.  Started getting heart palpitations immediately.  They would come and go throughout the week.  One or two days of the week my heart beat would be very irregular and the palpitations were frequent.  Then they'd ebb away for a few days until I'd only experience a couple a day.  Then they'd come back slowly until they were severe again.  Mild exertion (even standing up) seemed to make them worse.  Read this forum and stopped taking medicine.  The palpitations disappeared the next day.  Took one more dosage_ and they came back.  This medicine is most definitely the cause of the palpitations.

Vitamin deficient caused by the drug blocking absorbtion.,I found out that by taking this drug it was causing a host of other problems and ruining my life.  I felt like I was dying and didn't know why. My dr. just kept prescribing it to me and I dumbly just kept taking it until I moved and got a new Dr. that knew it had caused all these other problems.  The big part is that when you stop taking this drug there is REBOUND.  Your body produces MORE acid b/c of the drug and when you stop it over reacts to it.  They have found that it can take a month of two before you body settles down and stops over producing.

Although it stopped the severe heartburn I developed side effects that I didn't realize until recently.  I felt fine 3 months ago except for the heartburn.  About a month ago I developed severe joint pain.  I felt as if I had the flu and it was in my joints.  I developed a severe ankle pain in my right ankle that prevented me from walking at times.  I started having hot flashes which I haven't had in years.  I started thinking about why I felt this way and what had changed.  I realized that the problems all started when I started taking Prilosec.  I went off of it two days ago and I am starting to feel like myself again.  I had no idea that this over the counter drug could cause such bad side effects.  I will deal with my heartburn with Pepcid from now on.

666, 1, gerd,I was prescrbed this for mild acid reflux and became addicted to it very quickly. I developed esophagitis and gastritis while I was on it for the first time in my life. I was told it was safe and it was for a while. My chest pain was severe for 2 months until I quit taking it. Not to mention_ heart palpatations_ numbness in my hands and feet_ always tired_ and bacterial overgrowth due to acid suppression. It was hard to get off of it because of acid rebound. I had so many problems because of this drug. It screwed up my good flora in my digestive tract. I also started having kidney stone_ (don't know if it is related) I know your kidneys' have acid pumps too. I was also pale due to iron deffiecency.,Long story short_ that was last August when I quit taking it and now I feel like a new man. It took me about 7 months to get over the damage. I finally feel like myself again. I advise anyone taking this drug to do your research. I thought I was going to be on it for the rest of my life. If it wasn't for the problems I had from it I would still be on it. But_ guess what_ they won't get my money anymore! Ppis' are becoming a problem. More and more people are getting ill from these drugs. Please do your homework and find better ways of dealing with your reflux. Diet is your biggest factor! If you don't believe me_ than I'm sorry for you_ I really am. This drug messed up about 7 months of my life.

Wierd!.BE WARNED!,I was so relieved to find this site and promised myself that if I ever got out of the fog_ I would post! I had a pretty rough time coming off tramadol post op but didn't once consider that a PPI could give me such severe side effects. The worst reaction for me was feeling sick ALL THE TIME - couldn't eat as I had no appetite and even a sip of water would leave me with a feeling that something heavy was sitting on my throat and would lead to severe anxiety. Never previously suffered with acid reflux/ heartburn problems but sure am now I have quit (and will probably undo any erosion healing that has taken place- ggrrr!).

Day 3 is when things started going downhill.  I started feeling abdominal pains and my stomach would become bloated if I even ate as little as a couple of slices of toast_ so that pretty much killed my appetite.  Then yesterday (Day 4) my blood pressure_ which is controlled by medication_ started to spike up to 150/95.  I also became very jittery and was too wired to sleep last night.I decided last night to stop taking prilosec because the side effects were worse than the heartburn.  It was only after doing a google search on side effects that I found this place_ I wish I had sooner.  At the very least there should be a warning on the box for people with hypertension.

The first month was ok but got a really bad dizzy spell at work and then bad headaches so bad that nothing helped it for a day.  The joint pains are the worst.  I stopped the medicine 3 weeks ago and am now told I had a reaction to this medicine from my doctor.  It takes 2 weeks to leave your body and 2 - 4 weeks from the symptoms to go away.  I had bloodwork and everything seems ok.  My doctor has seen this before and knew right away when I told him what was going on with my pains.

691, 1, Reflux,Stomach pain - urge of BM but couldn't go - weepy_ emotionally weird,My daughter suddenly developed reflux_ indigestion_ constipation and food sensitivities a couple of months ago after having a severe reaction to Amoxicillin. I took her to an ENT and GI they both confirmed the reflux. Neither one thought it was related to the antibiotic she took.  They both prescribed Prilosec in an adult dose which I was instantly leery about giving her.  After 3 days she was having different symptoms than her original ones_ and acting strange emotionally too.  I looked it up online and I can't believe these doctors really gave this to her with no warning about possible side effects.  If anybody out there has had a similar problem after taking antibiotics_ please email me.  I feel like I'm on my own.  The doctors have written their prescription and are done with us.  I have her on probiotics and I am really watching what she eats.  I'm hoping if I can heal her gut_ this will go away on it's own.  Doctors are supposed to help people_ I really don't believe that anymore.  I will never give my kids a prescribed drug again without knowing exactly what it's for and what the side effects are. I don't trust these medications at all - especially generic ones.,F,10,3  days20 1X D,2/20/2010Email,Prilosec

Sure it worked.  But the side effects were horrible.  It was only when I saw this site that I finally understood that everything I was feeling were side effects from this medication.  Then I read up on PPI's and found that they are the worst thing you can take.  It stops you from producing acid - period.  Without any acid in your stomach you can't digest anything.  What doesn't digest sits there and rots in your stomach and causes more acid which is what causes the reflux.   The doctors don't tell you that!  I threw out the rest of medicine.  The first couple of days were a bit rough_ but I started using apple cider vinegar_ digestive enzymes_ and take ginger and slippery elm when I need it and I've been feeling much better these last 4 days not using the Prilosec.

It actually worked beautifully for the acid reflux for the first 3-4 days of taking it.  I was so thankful and impressed that I nearly sent my MD flowers!  But then the symptoms began as noted under the side effects I listed.  Even with stopping it at day 15 (and I am now at day 18) I am still so lethargic and hurting so badly that I can't function very well.  The metallic taste and tingling and soreness of my tongue are starting to recede_ but my throat and neck still hurt enough that I don't want to eat.  I went to see the MD on call at my physicians practice on day 15_ they didn't give a definitive answer.  I just said I was stopping taking it and they suggested taking Pepcid AC instead_ and scheduled me for an upper and lower GI.  Haven't done any of those things yet.  The side effects have definitely been worse than the reflux.  My goal now is to stay away from any medicines as much as possible.  Are all doctors really so busy now that they don't have time to care for their patients and discuss the pros and cons of various alternatives?

With head pains in everything. At that point I had stopped the Zantac as that was what I was taking at the time. I did not know it was the medicine. At the end of Jan_ my stomach pain had returned so I started taking the Zantac (ranitdine) again_ after a couple days I felt weird and read that Priolsec (the offbrand) was better at healing ulcers in the studies they had done. Well_ I happened to have some on me from last year (it has not experienced yet) and when I took it I had only taken it a couple times. So_ I took it every morning at 9 or 10am. Before I ate. The 1st day an hour after I took it I felt out of my body and crazy. By the 4th day my face was hot and numb for a couple of hrs then it would go back to normal. I've stopped taking it for 3 days now_ I need to know how long it takes to get out of someones system and if anyone else has experienced these things. I still have some numbness in my legs and in my face it's red and numb. Please EMAIL me and tell me if you guys experienced this and how long it took to go away!

My 12 year old daughter has been on it as well. I've been on it for a month longer than her. Out of desperation I woke her up at 3:30 in the morning when I couldn't sleep 2 nights ago_ after many nights and asked her if she has been having problems sleeping. She said she had been waking up at 3:30 or 5 a.m. every morning and we set our alarms for 6 a.m.  How strange we both woke up at 3:30 every morning and we take the same pill the same time every day. She also told me she'd been hallucinating. She thought these things would go away. We stopped taking it that day! It scares me how many teenagers might be taking this and these symptoms drive them over the edge to suicide_ because I had a hard time handling the symptoms and I'm an adult. They need to take this junk off the market. I'm going to try natural remedies for myself and my daughter_ like the vinegar thing_ which I found on the internet. Why don't the doctors tell us about those_ instead of pushing these pills? I've been on Kapidex_ had severe leg cramps_ went off it_ so I probably didn't get far enough to reach anxiety; been on Nexium and broke out in hives_ went off it and now this.

Pressure in head and sometimes behind eyes (headaches)_Detached feeling_ abnormal mentally with mental fog. Fatigue and weakness. Hardly feel like moving or communicating with my family.Dizziness. Dry mouth initially.Tingling electric shock feelings in arms and legs (paratheisa). Headaches seem to be worse,Was on the 20mg Prilosec about 3 weeks when severe insomnia started. Got Temezapam for that but didn't realy help and then added Sonata which helped a little. Thought I just had a messed up sleep cycle. I was getting forgetful and somewhat spacey but figured it was age with the sleep deprivation. I then started wtih the tingling in extremities and sometimes scalp and noticed my vision blurring. I became extra fatgued and mentally out of it. Felt like I was looking outside of myself. Some depression and anxiety as I began to be concerned about Multiple Sclerosis or such. Easier to cry. Thank the Lord I found this website and decided that it had to be Prilosec so I stopped it and started b12 sublingually as I figured it had been depleted as a lot of the symptoms mimic b12 defeciency as well as MS. Felt so bad that I went to urgent care and got b12 injection which appeared to help some but then back to all the previous synptoms. Read where some people metabolize this slower and get overdosage. Either that or its just poison! Been off now for 10 days and still feel like I'm dying. Going to my primary MD and will show her these other ratings where the symptoms of others are just like mine.

Two days into Prilosec_ and the generic_ heartburn was essentially gone.  But I've noticed some joint pain the last few months and some on my left hip which my Dr. diagnosed as bursitis.  Took ibuprofin for two weeks and switched to Aleve and had no tangible effect.A few weeks ago I noticed that the general pains seemed to be subsiding and what I didn't put together at the time was that finances prevented me from getting more Prilosec for about a month.  Now_ a few weeks later_ I've been using it again and the flu-like joint pain is coming back along with the 'bursitis'.  I just took the last of the current box and I'm purposly going to go off it for at least a month to see whether it was a conicidence.Heartburn was interfering with my sleep and causing other general discomfort a couple of hours after a meal_ so I'm not looking forward to that_ but I have to know if this is the cause.

726, 1, gerd,I had every side effect you could think of. i had extreme chest pain and i mean extreme chest pain. i was told by a doc to take this for gerd. i think it would be great if you have a bad case with ulcers.,i developed bacterial overgrowth and candida from this drug suppresing my acid so much. every time i quit my acid came back worse untill one day i quit and had no acid and i mean none. very scary feeling having no acid in my stomach. a month later it came back though _ thank god! I would burp up water it seemed like and i was extremly bloated for that month. now i have to get over my other problems. no more acid reflux after being off it for 6 months though. maybe just a little.,M,25,2  days,1/14/2010Email,Prilosec

728, 1, GERD,My side effects worsened over the years of taking Prilosec. At first it worked great for drying up the acid in my stomach but caused my hips and lower back to ache if I took it for more than a week. Later it worked well for my stomach but caused those symptoms plus arthritis like aching in my hands. I have recently realized that severe headaches that I have had for several years that I thought was strictly sinus pressure related was for the most part caused by the Prilosec.,It sure helps your stomach acid problem but overall was not helpful to me. I am soooo glad that I finally realized that it was causing my headaches. I feel like I have got my life back now even though I still have some problems with my GERD.,M,58,10  years,1/12/2010Email,Prilosec

None seemed to help until I tried the Prilosec.  Helped my stomach greatly_ but am now experiencing terrible belching_ a feeling of a tasteless and oddorless gas coming into my throat_ trouble breathing_ a dry cough_ fatigue_ blurred vision_ loss of energy which causes loss of interst in doing the things I most enjoy and last but not least_ incredible hair loss!,Will be seeing my doctor ASAP to discuss getting off of the Prilosec_ but fear having the GERD symptoms_ tightness in chest_ lump in throat_ feeling sick to my stomach/burning stomach_ return.  Not sure which is worse_ the symptoms of GERD or the side affects of the drug. Back to the drawing board on finding alternative remedies that work.  Have been using apple cider vinegar_ honey and applesauce and these help a great deal. I'm game for getting off the meds to see if my stomach has healed enough to rely on the vinegar_ honey and applesauce and to just be very careful to eat small meals and avoid trigger foods.,F,47,3  months,1/7/2010Email,Prilosec

736, 1, acid reflux,This stuff really works for the acid reflux_ but after about a year_ I started to have an irregular heartbeat_ so I did some research and discovered that is a common side affect of the Prilosec.  I stopped it about three days ago_ and the symptoms are waning.  If you can tolerate it_ it works great.  But_ just be prepared there might be adverse reactions.  I'd rather have the relux than the irregular heartbeat.,,F,60,1  years,1/4/2010,Prilosec

738, 2, Horrible heartburn,Over the years it became less effective and I started taking more to deal with horrible stomach pain.  I developed arthritis in my ankle so bad I could not walk at night and as a long-time weight lifter_ I noticed I was getting weaker at a rate not attributable to aging.  Quitting was hell.  Since quitting about two months ago the problems with arthritis have improved and finally I am regaining stregnth in the gym.,Acid problems are horrible_ but there is a reason the manufacturer recommends limiting this product to a few weeks use.For me_ long term use was quite bad.  Quitting was extremely difficult_ but I seem to be slowly improving in the areas of pain and weakness.  And now that I am off the medicine_ I am learning which foods to avoid (pizza_ beer_ coffee) and my stomach is better than when I was on the medicine. For long term users_ I highly recommend slowly reducing the dosage and then stopping (I tapered off over about 5 weeks).  At first the stomach pain is horrible_ but for me the long term health effects have been well worth it and I feel better off the med than on the med.  Best of luck to all and thank you for your input.,M,51,7  years,12/30/2009,Prilosec
739, 2, Acid reflux_ heartburn,Severe back and spine pain_ low temp (96.5-97.5)_ tingling and numbness in toes and fingers (especially big toes and ring and pinkie fingers)_ heart stabbing pain (like a blood clot or heart attack)_ numbness in left arm_ shooting pains_ difficulty breathing and shortness of breath_ difficulty swallowing_ central nervous system failure like if i didn't breathe myself_ my central nervous system wouldn't bother (went to the ER once in a panic)_ feeling like slipping into a coma then snapping out of it in a panic_ chills_ headache_ dizziness_ dry itchy eyes (like sand in them and no amount of eye drops helped)_ week heart beat_ UTIs_ and ringing in ears. Diagnosed Vitamin B-12 (B12) deficiency. Diagnosed 3x increase of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) to above normal levels (possible sub-clinical hypothyroid).,"A year ago I went to my doctor about numbness in my toes and fingers_ and the doc thought it might be a vitamin B12 deficiency (a test proved so). He said to take a B complex vitamin (I take a daily Centrum). I mentioned my other symptoms_ and he thought the chest pains were all related to my previous diagnoses of acid reflux. I've been taking Prilosec OTC regularly_ and asked about the 14-day limit warning. He said don't worry_ I need to take it forever. ""OK"". So over the last year my symptoms got worse_ but not consistent. I could go days feeling OK_ but other times very bad (I even went to the ER once). I've been back to see my doc and he never asked about or tested B12 again_ or suggest Priolosec was to blame. I soon noticed a pattern when I stopped taking Priolosec regularly. I bet my B12 absorption has decreased even more and the daily multi was not enough to overcome the B12 issue_ along with potassium absorption_ etc. Yesterday I took a single B12 vitamin with 500 mg (8_333% DV compared to Centrum's 6mg 100% DV)_ and my body temp went back to normal_ and I feel much better today. I wouldn't have tried that until I remembered the B12 thing a year ago. I am upset my doc did not make it clear that I need a high dose of B12 to overcome the absorption problems Prilosec causes_ and that a daily multi-v wouldn't cut it_ and not even suggest Prilosec was the cause_ or even retest B12 (which is suggested on drugs.com for long term Prilosec users).",M,38,2  years,12/29/2009,Prilosec

Doctor prescribed Propranolol which definitely kept the anxiety at bay.  Another side effect of the stress a couple of weeks later was acid reflux.  Wound up going to the emergency room and they gave me Maalox with Lidocaine and Prilosec.  About and hour I felt much better.  I was prescribed Nexium but due to the cost_ the pharmacist called the doctor and asked if I could simply take OTC Prilosec.  Dosage 40 mg/day.  About 3 days later I started to feel much better so I continued to take the Prilosec.  After this I seemed to have so many symptoms_ but attributed them to the stress.  However at about day 8 of taking this drug_ I started noticing blurry vision and my energy level plummeted_ to the point where I would have to take a nap during the day or Id fall asleep at inappropriate times of the day.

All of which were not present prior to being perscribed a PPI.,Was prescribed another PPI (Protonix) in April and over the next several months noticed increased tightness in my chest and difficulty maintaining composure (excessive outburst of anger/anxiety). In July ended up pulling over to the side of the road while driving home with what I now know were withdrawal symptoms from the first PPI (had run out a couple days prior). ER doc prescribed prilosec along with tranquilizers for panic/anxiety and I have been fighting what I thought was a neurological problem ever since. Got the flue a couple weeks ago and stopped taking prilosec because of the anti biotics and after a week of a nightmare of depression and anxiety I all of a sudden felt great (tired but great). Still hadn't made the connection so I started taking the prilosec again and was terribly ill by the next day. Only got two doses before it clicked and started to detox again. Worst withdrawal I have ever felt_ thought I wasn't going to get through it at one point and now at day 7 off I am just able to get up and around. Be careful if you take any PPI's.

Even shaking hands with someone became absolute torture. My knuckles appeared swollen_ as did my elbows. On a hunch_ I stopped taking Emeprazole 5 days ago_ & low & behold_ the pain is starting to subside! I have never felt worse in my entire life_ & now a drug that was helping with my acid reflux might be to blame! The other side effects I've read on here (chest pain_ increased heart rate_ etc._ I have NOT experienced). Please_ if anyone has had agonizing hand/wrist pain_ please let me know.

767, 1, Esophageal Cancer,Loss of appetite_ feeling full_ food tasted bad_ dry cough_ iron not being absorbed (anemic)_ no deep sleep (waking up every 2-3 hours).,I was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer back in September and was told to take Prilosec OTC everyday when released from the hospital. My appetite decreased shortly after but thought it was due to being depressed about having cancer.Last week I was in the hospital getting my chemo and radiation and while in there I did not take Priosec_ I believe they gave me Nexium instead. My appetite was good even while having chemo. In this week afterward I started taking Prilosec again and have no appetite_ a feeling of being full_ food does not taste good_ dry cough_ and I am not sleeping well (even after taking a prescribed Ambien). Also_ my hemoglobin's are down again compared to being in the hospital because I am not absorbing iron. Currently Prilosec is the only drug that I am taking. Tomorrow I will stop it and see if I can get Nexium instead if I really need anything at all. It has been a rough week but I am glad I found this site.

Avoid it at ALL costs!!!,Avoid this drug - ask for something else. Zantac is not a PPI_ but it can help with less dramatic side effects.

779, 1, gastritis_ possible ulcer,Started having pain in right side up under ribs.  Doctor did HIDA scan and ultrasound of gallbladder and was functioning at boarderline normal at 36 (34 is below normal).,Found a study from the Univ of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Dr.s Cahan M.A._ Balduf L.; Colton K.; Palacioz B.; McCartney W.; Farrell T.M. that showed that Prilosec decreases gallbladder function in healthy people.  These people went back to normal after stopping Priolsec.  This drug also has a nasty rebound effect for me.  I have some bad acid days while trying to wean off.  I am currently on a 50% dose (10mg) and want to switch to a 25% dose in 2 days.  I am transisitioning to Zantac for a while and then hopefully to nothing.  I am taking DGL_ L-glutamine and Zinc-Carasate (not sure spelled right). Gastritis appears gone_ as is most of the side pain from the gallbladder.  Good luck to everyone!

Swollen finger joints_ achy arms_ shoulders_ hips_ diahhrea_ cramps_ feeling hopeless at strange times,Once read an article that asked physicians which drug they prescribe that they wouldn't take - Prilosec was #1.  My doc laughed when I told him about it (as he prescribed it for me.) I've been on POTC for 5 months - 2 a day.  At first it helped reflux perfectly with one a day.  Started having stomach aches_ doc told me to take 2 a day and added Donnotol for IBS (even though I knew it wasn't that - had it before_ this was different.)  So_ am to the place I described. Had upper GI and colonoscopy because I felt so awful all the time.  Found nothing.  With swollen/stiff fingers this past month I've had enough.  I finally remembered reading about these side effects with Prilosec when I first started taking it_ but thought it wouldn't effect me.  I was wrong!

782, 2, GERD,I came down with Osteopenia (a precurser to Osterporosis) and joint pain and complications.,There was no reason for osteopenia for me--not in my family makeup; I exercise regularly; I lift weights; and have been taking calsium for many years--so I was bewildered and then the GMA morning show featured a doctor who mentioned that they are finding that proton pump inhibitors are responsible for some people acquiring osteoporosis and a light went on.  On this website I found out about the rebound effect of Prilosec and went off immediately.  I used probiotics and enzymes to help through the first four weeks (especially the first two weeks) and now it has been over two months---no more problems.  I do watch how much I eat and when I eat_ but generally speaking I no longer have a problem.  I believe my GERD started because of taking ibuprophen and other aspirin containing products.

I also started to have constipation and a weird full feeling while my stomach was growling.  Most troubling for me was the terrible panic attacks_ severe depression and racing thoughts.  I was ready to check myself in at a psych ward.  I also experienced weird body aches and pains and feelings of complete exhaustion.  I really thought I had a terminal disease or the end was near for me.  I asked the Doctor if Prilosec could be causing all this but was told ""no_ it's a great drug"". Yeah_ right!  PLEASE_ PLEASE_ PLEASE do yourself a favor and do not take this drug.  It will sneak up on you and will change for life in a bad way.

Please submit your side effects to the FDA so others can be warned of the dangers of Prilosec.,M,36,55  days,8/8/2009,Prilosec

805, 3, Erosive Esophogitis,Just started taking this medicine_ I'm hoping I do well_ its only the 14 days treatment_ I have tried Protonix and let me tell you that is a very strong Rx! I'm just curious though if prilosec is so bad how come the shelves are always empty?,I see a lot of people complaining about muscle problems_ I learned that with having GERD_ and other acid reflux problems that you lose a lot of Potassium_ and taking acid reflux medicines your body don't absorb vitamins and nutrients very well_ so those are things to take into consideration rather then automatically thinking that its the medicine....Like I said I'm only taking the 14 day medicine_ wish me luck!,F,31,1  days,7/25/2009Email,Prilosec

I found this site after finding no side effects on the lable. WOW what a relief. I was hospitalized with chest pain_ low blood pressure_ low mineral levals_ all due to this little purple pill_ I knew this was to good to be true.  I really thought I was going to die with heart problems. Its been 3 days since I have stopped taking this drug Im starting to feel more energetic and the cramping chest pains are nearly gone. I havent had as many attacks of irregular heart beat. I really am glad I had the sense to stop this drug. For three days I have taken one half a shot of ACV and it really works. I actually felt like working in the yard today. I had lost my drive to live and thought I would have to go to a shrink to get to the bottom of this. My eyes are more focused and I dont have the pressure anymore. I beginning to get my close up sight back.  I truley thought this was from my age. But now I realize it was this dangerous drug that will cause horrible symtoms.

I cant stand even the first pill_ the smell is nasty & sooooo disgusting and my own breath stinks to myself every breath.  I have been trying to eat and drink but cant get rid of this awful taste... and the headache started about 4 hours after taking it_ still aching now at about 10 hours after taking it.  I was really surprised to get such severe gut pains and this wierd headache that almost has a wierd 'taste' too_ it's a different kind of headache than I've ever had.  The awful taste is so different from anything I've ever tasted I cant even describe it.  It has sortof a sweet aspect_ gives me a totally new definition of sickly-sweet.  YUK!!!  Time for me to research what to eat and other natural remedies_ NO WAY I will ever take another pill in this category.  I have to solve this problem with a better solution.  I have enough other problems to begin with.  If anyone has a solution to this taste and smell on the breath after taking Prilosec_ please post it here!!!

It should be taken only in the morning with a glass of water. Always wait a full 24 hours before taking the next dosage. Many people choose to way 48 hours_ still the 20mg is too strong for some. You should read the entire web site that I show here_ it has a list of medications along with mentioning you should not use with vitamins_ minerals_ etc. They give a phone # to report your side effects to the FDA. Prepare for MASSIVE heart burn after stopping this med. I am on my 3rd day and like others have posted_ the heartburn is BAD_ and I did not have it before. I've also learned that pillows are inefective_ you MUST raise you headboard 6-8"" so that the entire bed is tilted. Do not eat or drink anything except water 2 hours before laying down_ and 3-4 if it is on the no-no list (milk_ fat_ carbinated drink (any type)_ caffine_ etc.) Loose weight\excersize.

If you're stopping this drug_ be prepared for a couple bouts of heartburn before getting back to normal.I think now that acid suppression is the wrong way to go for these symptoms_ and that physicians are all too ready to diagnose GERD because it is an excuse to prescribe this expensive medicine that has been advertised to them to the point of saturation.

I am not sure how many other things are from this pill or drug interactions that Doctors should know about but I was getting bad migraines with Auras so bad I could barely see out of one eye.,I think the worst thing other than the hip is that once you are on the drug for an extended period of time it is near impossible to get off it. I am working very hard to wean myself off with natural methods but I can't go with out or the heart burn is WAY worse than it was before I started taking the pills.

846, 2, Heartburn,Sharp/Severe muscle pain_ Muscle Sensitivity_ Excessive Sweating_ Bad Headaches (above my eyes)_ joint pain_ bloating_ anxiety_ a weird feeling when breathing (like i have been sucking on a cough drop.),On my 13th day of the 14 day pack I started feeling a sharp pain in what felt like my kidneys/lower back.  A day later added a sharp pain in my neck followed by bad headaches above my eyes. I would explain it as a severe muscle sensitivity. At this point_ if i use any muscle more then a few times then it feels like i have been beet up.  I went power walking 4 days ago & my legs still throb and feel like dead weight.  I have been waking up every night with the inability to move my neck & with the sheets drenched in sweat.  At first I thought this was a wonder drug. After one day my heartburn was gone.  But now...not worth it.  The pain I am in is almost unbearable_ even with pain meds & a heating pad.,F,29,14  days,6/5/2009Email,Prilosec

Ringing in my ears is almost too much to take.,I didn't know any of this was prilosec.  I never had any thing like this never felt down or depressed and now I do.  Feel like my short term memory is off.  What to do is the question?  My GERD has givin me Barrets esophagus_ so do I stop feel normal and hope to control the acid reflux with diet alone?  Maybe better than this just don't feel like me!  I did have panic about the GERD because I didn't know what was making me feel like I couldn't breath (after eating) and having chest pain.  Plus I had a odd smell sensation of ciggarett smoke like an ash tray.  It has gone mostly gone away since taking prilosec.,M,44,60  days,6/2/2009,Prilosec
848, 1, Acid reflux,Increasingly severe joint aches sometimes causing me to wake up at night--hip_ neck_ fingers (sharp and intense attacks of pain that felt like pin pricks)_ shoulders and lower back pain; dry mouth at night; chest tightness; irregular heartbeats; unusual fatigue,At first I attributed the symptoms to age since they came on gradually_ but finally I was feeling almost crippled with neck_ hip_ and back pain. I have been an active person--tennis_ rowing_ skiing etc_ and I was having trouble just walking. I visited my doctor several times with each of these complaints. He said heart irregularity was not serious enough to worry about and told me to cut down on drinks with caffeine. Joint aches were explained away as arthritis. I just had a chest xray at my request because of aches and tightness in my chest--negative results; Dr. told me to increase Prilosec--I was taking OTC 20 mil 1 tablet a day--to 2 tablets. By coincidence I had just read the recent NY Times article on dangers of some acid-reflux drugs including Prilosec and decided to stop taking it without consulting Dr. Today 3 days after I have stopped taking Prilosec I realize that I am free of joint aches and feel like the person I was before all of the symptoms started piling up on me. I knew something was wrong and that something had to be done_ but it never occurred to me that Prilosec might be the cause. Out of curiosity I went online to check side effects_ and I was stunned when I read this report. I am really distressed that my doctor never questioned Prilosec as a possible cause and instead advised me to increase the dosage. As many have already commented_ I will find my own way to deal with acid reflux but I will definitely stop taking this drug.,M,71,6  months,5/29/2009,Prilosec

However with Sams Club Omeprazole_ in 14 days I had a foggy feeling_ light headedness_ tingling & numbness in hands and feet_ felt out of it.  Seemed worse when hungry & after eating.  Tingling & numbness got much worse after eating.  Also slight numbness in face.,Prilosec was really good.  But the Sam's Club Omeprazole was a disaster.  I switched because it was cheaper.  Went to doctor with side effects that I listed_ he thought it was diabetes.  Bought a meter and quickly ruled that out.  Vitamin B-12 was normal (Even after 4 years of Prilosec).  I've been off Omeprazole 5 days and I'm much_ much better.  My doctor thought it would take 5 days (Half life) to get out and he was right.  Feel normal now.

Thinking back_ I realize the tingling began almost immediately upon beginning Prilosec. The other side effects began to set in after 1 month.,Well I should have believed everyone else on this website. I ended up getting a $9000 plus MRI to rule out MS which my neurologist thought I had. 3 doctors told me it could not be the Prilosec! I went off Prilosec 3 weeks ago--joint pain went away quickly_ everything but tingling has tapered off. Tingling is much reduced though. Just got my MRI results yesterday...Thank God!

I also have been taking Protonix 40 mg for several years without any problem. Why he put me on 2 different proton pump inhibitors is beyond me.

My digestive system is finally returning to normal.  I believe that omeprazole_ like all proton inhibitor drugs_ stopped acid production and killed off the beneficial digestive enzymes.  This in turn created a yeast problem.  To counteract the yeast_ I tried to eliminate all wheat products and processed sugars from my diet. Ate lots of potato dishes_ fresh fruit and vegetables_ fresh protein.  Ate plain yogurt every morning to replace the enzymes.  Unflavored Activia is really good.  It took a really long time_ but I am much_ much better.  I am now reintroducing yeast products back into my diet.  Also dealt with the underlying problem that caused the stress and gerd.

However_ those went away.  Now_ just recently_ I have been sensitive to motion and lightheaded.  It was strange...I would go a few weeks and be fine....then_ I would have a bad day and it would take about a week to recover.  Anyone else have similar experiences?,M,28,1.5  months,3/25/2009Email,Prilosec
889, 1, Reflux,I've only been taking the OTC Prilosec for about 10 days_ but I've noticed extreme fatigue_ nausea_ pain after eating_ feeling of disorientation and headache. It's all very unpleasant_ and I can't imagine taking the prescription form!,I agree that the people who read this information on this site are probably here because they have side effects. For those who don't_ great....but for those who do_ the effects sound horrendous. Good reason to use natural remedies_ if you ask me.,F,59,10  days,3/24/2009,Prilosec
890, 3, Acid Reflux,Prilosec completely cured my acid reflux but I experienced very watery extremely urgent diarrhea one to three times a day.  Any alcohol consumption made the diarrhea worse.  Anti-diarrheal medications helped somewhat but the unpredictable bouts of diarrhea caused me to quit Prilosec.  I switched to Ranitidine (150-225mg/day) and the watery diarrhea disappeared almost immediately.,I took Prilosec for several years and the seriousness of the diarrhea crept up on me slowly so I did not associate it with Prilosec.  I was listening to a nutritionist talk about irregularity and she mentioned that a digestive system with too little acid can result in causing vile bouts of diarrhea.  Apparently_ Prilosec resulted in more acid reduction than my system could tolerate.  The Ranitidine does not work as effectively to control my acid reflux but my overall quality of life is so improved that I will never go back to Prilosec.,M,62,5  years,3/23/2009,Prilosec

I just recently had an upper and lower GI performed and lab work done for the constant diarrhea and nausea ect. Nothing out of the ordinary was found.The GI doctor put me on a new drug called KAPIDEX and within 3 days all of my listed side affects from Prilosec were gone! ,M,41,11  years,3/23/2009Email,Prilosec
892, 1, acid reflux,Painful headaches_ primarily above the eye. Feelings of nausea_ fatigue and illness. All symptoms especially pronounced after eating. Slight dizziness and difficulty concentrating. Dry mouth after sleep. Mild shortness of breath and feelings of bloating.,I'll be stopping this medication now after three days of use. The headaches are particularly bad_ and the side effects being stronger after eating is not something I'm willing to put up with.  The mild acid reflux IS gone_ but not worth the side effects.,M,27,3  days,3/20/2009,Prilosec
893, 5, acid reflux,None,I have always been an anxious person so in no way can i attirbute that to the Prilosec OTC.  I started taking Aciphex but the doctor kept wanting to see me every 6 months which made no sense since the situation was the same everytime... i still needed the meds because my heartburn would come right back if i stopped taking it.  Instead of just renewing my prescription i had to keep going in which was too much.  Switched to Prilosec OTC and have loved it for about 8 years.  Heartburn still comes back if i forget to take it for a day_ so i need to stay on it.  Hard to believe people have such severe mental side effects.,M,28,8  years,3/19/2009,Prilosec
894, 3, Chest pain/burning,I was experiencing chest pain and/or burning and the doctor recommended I try Prilosec.  The doctor gave me a 30 day supply of 20mg which I took 21 before tying my side effects to the medication and doing some research.  Should have been 14 days and off and then 10mg if necessary but that was never mentioned.  My side effects were/are sudden anxiety_ different chest AND arm pain and headaches.  These were NOT present prior to the medication.  The med DID help my chest pain but caused a lot more negatives.,I have read that an effect of Prilosec can be a b12 deficiency given that your stomach acid is diminished which would then not allow the difficult to ingest B12 to get into your system.  A side effect in B12 deficiency is anxiety_ chest pains_ etc..  I'm curious if I am now B12 deficient but am not going to bother with a doctor.  I just went off the med two days ago_ felt much better the next day but not perfect.  Figure this will take a while to get fully out of my system regardless of reported half life.  I am a petite size 2 and fully believe this med was much too strong for me.  Guess I'll see in 5 or 6 days if I'm much better.  If I had the nerve_ once better I'd try it again to see for sure but this feeling sucks and I'm not risking being right!,F,39,21  days,3/19/2009,Prilosec

Thought I was going mad. Finally clicked_ came off them and made appointment with doctor who patronised me mercilessly whilst poo pooing the very idea_ this was done despite the fact that by day three I was sleeping again (lying down instead of propped up on anxious sentry duty - I was that scared to go to sleep) the panic attacks had disappeared and the other symptoms had lessened greatly.  Day 4 however_ I became extremely light-headed with a heavy feeling in my left arm.  Went to senior doctor in practice and_ despite more strong denials_ demanded blood tests and that the whole episode be documented and reported_ which he did.  To all british people who have taken this drug with similiar effects_ your GP has something called a yellow card on which he can list and report side-effects from any drug_ particularly side-effects that aren't recognised.  Don't be put off.  Demand it is used.  It might well change things.  The companies can't have proper figures on this if the GPs aren't reporting it.  I wouldn't take this hell on earth medication again if my life depended on it!!!!!!!,F,49,4  months,3/17/2009Email,Prilosec

Joint pain. Pain in ends of fingers. Heart palps.,Has anyones doctor told them why we cannot tolerate this stuff? Zantac does the same thing to me and is less effective on stopping my HB. Has anyone found another med that is effective on their HB and reflux without these side effects. Please post if anyone has any advise on what we can do instead of taking this crap. It should be illegal. What really sucks is my doc says it can't be the prilosec or zantac that causes these effects. Does anyone have a good doc out there that admitted it was the prilosec? Good news is side effects do wear off after a few mo's. You have to wean yourself off the prilosec gradually. Take 1/2 a pill and then every other day_ etc. Acid rebound is horrible. Please email me if you have found a better med to take or if you know why it affects us this way. Are we allergic?,F,41,20  days,3/11/2009Email,Prilosec
901, 2, GERD,high blood pressure during use,I took the OTC for about the year and a half. I've been working out hard for 6 months almost all cardio so I wanted to see how my blood pressure improved. It was off the charts! WAY high. I read that a side of prilosec is increased blood pressure so I quit taking it. After about a week of being off the pills I am having panic attack symptoms - irregular breathing_ tingly sensation in hands_ feet_ and face_ feeling of fatigue_ muscles feel tired_ sleep disruption and almost passed out once at work. Went to urgent care where the doctor said I had a panic attack. Following up with regular doctor next week_ but I am still having the panic attack symtpoms just not as bad. This stuff is bad news IMO.,M,39,2  years,3/7/2009,Prilosec

Unfortunately the esophagus behaves/reads very similar to the heart (according to my doctor).  Just as I was starting to feel a little better I got home and took another pill and started feeling bad almost immediately.  At first the medicine seemed like a wonder drug_ but it turned in a very_ very bad way.  Since it is delayed release it takes a while before you start to feel normal again.  I repeat do not take this medicine.  It's a travesty that the FDA has allowed this medicine to be sold over the counter.  It is pure poison.,M,34,2  months,3/6/2009,Prilosec

Morning of second day (after just 1 dose) awoke with intense pain in both knees. Felt like joints were swollen. Could barely walk. OTC pain meds did not help. Continued taking as prescribed and pain remained. Poor sleep. Constant pain even when sitting/laying down/sleeping. Missed one day of work because pain was so bad.

I have gained almost twenty pounds in the nearly ten years I've been taking Prilosec (or omeprazole) and have great fatigue.  Until reaching this web site_ I didn't put these symptoms together with the med.,After many years on Prilosec/omeprazole it became less and less effective.  With continuing heartburn and throat-clearing_ my doctor ordered an EGD which showed Barrett's esophagus.  He changed me to AciPhex and I will try that for a while.  Prilosec was wonderful for years_ but the effects of such long usage concern me.  Not taking medication could be worse_ however_ with the development of Barrett's.  I would strongly suggest that people with recurring heartburn undergo the EGD exam to understand what_ if any_ damage is being done by the acid reflux.,,66,9  years,3/1/2009,Prilosec

910, 1, pain at base breastbone_ gastritis,Back pain_ stomach pain_ tingling in hands and feet_ depression_chest pain,I took Prilosec for two months.  The doctor started me at 20mg per day for 30 days and then 20mg twice a day because of lack of improvement of symptoms.  Side effects got much worse with 40 mg per day.  I stopped Prilosec 4 weeks ago and still have tingling_ chest pain and stomach pain.  The first 3-4 days after I stopped were OK and then the side effects started again.  Also_ I now have bad acid reflux which I didn't have before I started the pills.  I'm told this is the acid rebound effect.  I started taking Zantac because the acid reflux started after 4 days of no Prilosec.  I would really like to hear from anyone who can tell me how long the side effects continue_ how long acid rebound can last and if anyone has had side effects from Zantac.

My symptoms started after my 3rd pill. This is a horrible drug and should be taken off the market immediately! It probably killed all the lab animals it was tested on.

Anyway_ I started taking Nexium after the ER incident_ but had to stop because it was making me feel weird: drowsy_ sluggish and lethargic_ stoned-out feeling_ alterations in taste_ loss of appetite.  Recently my heartburn has been flaring up_ so I decided to give Prilosec a try.  This is the 3rd day on it and I am going to quit - it makes me feel just as weird as when I was on Nexium_ if not worse.  For the past 2 nights I have been waking up at 3 or 4 am with a spinning dizzy feeling_ extreme thirst_ and overall ""stoned"" feeling.  I don't like it at all.

This started in the evenings at first but eventually began earlier and earlier in the day accompanied by the feeling that my arms were heavy and I couldn't lift them.  By day 13 I also had severe_ smelly diarreha. I've also had lots of gas.  I felt like I was crazy or dying!,On the 13th day I gave in and went to an urgent care center where an EKG was normal.  I asked the doctor if my symptoms could be side effects of Prilosec and he said possibly but not probable.  Unsatisfied and concerned_ I went straight from urgent care to the ER.  Another EKG was normal as was blood work (which tested RBC_ WBC_ glucose_ enzymes...) and a chest x-ray.  The ER doctor was baffled but did not entertain the idea that it could be side effects of Prilosec.  I quit taking the Prilosec on the 13th day.  2 days and I'm still having the anxiety /panic attack like symptoms but they aren't lasting as long in duration.

941, 1, Heartburn,Bloating_ weight gain_ fatigue.,Listen long time users of Prilosec!  I took it for years and thought I was getting a wonder drug until the long term effects kicked in.  Bloating_ cramping_ fatigue_ it was like I was pregnant.  Here is the cure that was recommended by a doctor (and has worked thus far); drink apple cider vinegar before meals.  Here is why.  Your stomach isn't breaking down your food properly.  This means you are not absorbing the proteins_ vitamins_ and minerals_ in your food.  Without acid in your stomach you are literally backing up like a garbage disposal.  The vinegar will tell your stomach-which is pretty much a litmus test- that it has enough acid so the body need not produce more.  Consider this_ without your vitamin Bs you will become sluggish i.e. the fatigue.  Without your essential minerals you will be unable to use the little nutrients you are taking in.  Without your branch chain aminos you are prone to soreness_ weakness_ and irritability.

I had a panic attack and went to the ER on 12/15/08.  I continued to have severe reflux and a lightheaded feeling for weeks after stopping the drug.  My head is now finally starting to clear.  I tracked down the manufacturer of the omeprazole that I took.  They wrote up a side effects report for the FDA with my consent.  I urge everyone to do the same.  You can also contact the FDA directly. This is the only way that we can force the FDA and the drug industry to reassess the safety of this drug.

After the pharmacist wanted to charge me over one hundred dollars for a thirty day supply_ I knew I had to find something else for my acid reflux disease.  Prilosec is the answer for me.

It was also negative.  But was told I could have it but be ""blood negative"". My C-reactive protein level kept rising (shows inflammation in the body).

It shut down my digestive system. My colon did not move_ I developed pain in the area of my gall bladder_ burped frequently_ and had chest pain with exertion. I quickly dropped back to one prilosec a day_ but my symptoms continued. Over a year's time_ I had a gall bladder scan_ colonoscopy_ endoscopy_ and heart scan. I tried to go off the drug but developed heartburn again. I finally switched to zantac 75 and all my symptoms went away. I had to figure this out myself. Every Dr. I saw was in total denial the drug could have caused these problems. From the constipation_ I developed a cystocele and rectocele. I have no sex life because of this.

Following morning i could hardly move as had severe muscle weakness and was very very tired.  Lastly was the palpitations that came on two-three times a day.,I had used Prilosec (omeprazole) before around 4 years ago and had the numbness and palpitations then.  At the time i didnt link this to the drug.  I phoned the doctor who told me that he didnt think it was the drug that was causing this but to stop anyway.  I have stopped and 2 days later i still have some symptoms.  Muscles feel about 70% back to normal and there is still a small amount of numbness in my hands and face.  I also have sore neck and shoulders and am still quite tired.  The doctor says that i am 'anxious' well who wouldnt be... i thought i had something incurable!!  I dont know how long this stuff stays in your system and wouldnt wish the effects on anyone (although it would help if the doctors could feel what you felt instead of labeling you as 'anxious' or a 'hypochondriac'  It would be great to hear from anyone that has or have had the same symptoms as i would love to know how quickly symptoms are going away.,M,34,5  days,12/12/2008Email,Prilosec

961, 1, GERD,I was prescribed this 8 months ago because I had a lump in my throat but no other GERD symptoms.  Since taking this med (40mg then 80mg per day) I got side effects.  Extreme lower back pain_ nausea in the morning and hair loss.  I had to get dyno out to unblock the drains as my hair blocked them up.  The man pulled out a massive ball of hair from the drains.,My gastroenterologist double dozed me to 80 mg per day and after than I felt worse.  I never had nausea in the morning until I started taking this drug.  It has made my silent GERD come alive!  I stopped taking this 1 week ago and my acid reflux is bad but I am going to persist and avoid this drug.  My GP was astonished the hospital had me on such a high dose for so long and she decided to stop the meds.  I am glad.  I would advise managing symptoms of GERD through good diet_ drinking water_ liquorice (deglycerised)_ anti-acids when it is bad.  So get some gaviscon and zantac in for over the festive season.  I should also say I took NSAID's with this drug for the extreme back pain and that gave me gastritis.

I took one dose and that night woke up feeling very very anxious_ almost panic attack. I am going thru a period of anxiety/depression so my baseline is high_ but this was the worst anxiety I've had in several months_ and there was no other trigger.

I have never felt so horrible in my whole life! This drug made me feel like I was going out of my mind and even had me contemplating suicide! The worst part is that the pamphlet that comes with this drug didn't list any side effects at all! I didn't know what was wrong with me.

I fell into a deep depression and felt lightheaded_ dizzy and stoned all the time. I went to my Dr and he couldn't find anything wrong with me!

I do notice some flatulence but I don't know if it is related to the drug or just my age.  In any event_ it is not excessive.,When Prilosec first came out_ I was taking generic Zantac before bed or before eating spicy foods.  My doctor suggested I try Prilosec.  Since they were quite expensive at the time_ I tried a half tablet each morning and found I still got all day relief.  I told my doctor about it and he said if it works to continue.  I asked about the 14 day warning_ but he said with a half tablet I should be OK taking them indefinitely.  He said the warning is for those who do not tolerate this drug.  I ask about continued use each time I go in for medical visits.  My new doctor concurs that it is safe to take in half-tablet form and can be effective for most patients.  If you are on a limited budget_ you might try a half tablet to see if you continue to get relief.,M,62,5  years,7/18/2008,Prilosec

1032, 5, Persistent Heartburn_ GERD?,None that I can think of.,I don't like going to the doctor_ and I believe I may have GERD_ so I decided to try Prilosec OTC. My father was on it and he said it worked wonders for him. His doctor had prescribed it to him daily and longer than the 14-day limit_ he was on it for something like 6 months to a year. I know the Prilosec OTC box says it may take 4 days before feeling relief from persistent heartburn_ but for me it works in a matter of two hours. I have been taking it every third day (or so_ when I feel like I need it) in order not to spend so much money on it. I also cut out some foods in my diet that I know cause me to have heartburn. I would be suffering without Prilosec. It's a lifesaver. Odd that so many people had such diverse side effects.,F,26,4  months,7/11/2008Email,Prilosec

Went to ER with atrial fibrillation - they zapped my heart back to normal beat.  Tests showed my heart was healthy.  Cardiologist said Nexium should have nothing to do with this episode_ but I later found out that long-term use can deplete B12 and iron.  2 weeks after starting b12 and iron supplements_ I felt much better.  Atrial fib has not returned.  I concluded my heart was having to work too hard since blood could not carry oxygen properly.   Doctors need to warn people about the vitamin issues.  Headaches and nausea started when I switched to daily Prilosec OTC_ but since it is much cheaper than Nexium_ I think I will stick with it_ as the side effects are tolerable compared to the GERD.,M,50,3  months,5/21/2008,Prilosec

The doctor prescribed antibiotics and antacids. All the antacids caused extreme gastric distress_ and then I tried Prilosec OTC. I got immediate_ miraculous relief from the stomach acid/ pain. I was elated. Unfortunately_ I started having chest pain_ depression and anxiety_ so I cut back on the Prilosec_ taking it about 3 days on/ 4 days off. The chest pain went away but I started getting bloating that seemed like extreme water retention_ worse in my left leg. Five months later_ I am still having swelling problems and the anxiety is worse.

1063, 3, GERD,General side effects include many of the things listed here (joint pain_ fatigue_ stomach discomfort and sharp pains (probably from intestinal gas)_ lower back pain_ etc.).  However_ much more severe side effects include a very bad case of clostridium difficile (C.Diff infection) a couple of years ago_ and B-12 deficiency.  The C. Diff went untreated due to me being such an unlikely candidate for contracting it.  The B-12 deficiency has shown up in the form fatigue_ back pain_ minor vision problems_ and is possibly even playing a role in fertility problems.  After failure to conceive after trying for 18 months_ I tested low for count (~11 million/mL_ when it should be >>20 million/mL) and motility was below average.  B-12 is essential to development of healthy sperm and sperm count.  It is also essential in the production of DNA and cell reproduction functions.  If stomach acid is insufficient_ B-12 cannot be absorbed from food.  There are also proton pumps present in the male re,Prilosec was a miracle drug for me for some time. Specialists told me that I would likely have to take Prilosec (or similar) for the rest of my life.  They said it was one of the safest and most effective drugs on the market and it was okay to disregard the warning labels.  I  believe that it is effective_ and safe in the short term_ but long term users beware.  There are many reasons that your stomach produces acid (proper nutrient digestion/absorption_ immuno-defence).  Stopping acid production for short periods may be effective to allow esophagal healing_ but long term use may be risky. I stopped taking Prilosec 3 months ago.  I have controlled stomach acid problems through diet (mainly low sugar) and occasional Tums.  I no longer have stomach pain_ lower back and joint pain has diminished.

I did find that treating my H-Pylori worked (which was missed in the first initial test). My biggest improvement was in eliminating wheat_ gluten_ caffine_ and soda pop from my diet. Also sticking to a healthy diet and regular exercise. I found almost all my symptoms have either dissapeared or are greatly relieved! And I had been suffering for years! I have had every test in the world done on me too! Including a colonostopy to check my entire colon and an endoscope for the throat to check the upper digestive track! So try diet and see if you have an allergy! For me it worked and I couldn't hardly eat before without suffering with horrible indigestion and heartburn and bloating_ bad chest pain_ extreme fatigue. I have more energy than every before! I at first thought I had Celiac disease but the Gastroenterologist took samples inside my colon and rulled it out. I believe an allergy to a common food irritant was what caused mine. Good luck with yours! My famil,F,49,14  days,3/11/2008,Prilosec

I also feel as if I am in a constant fog_ cannot focus on my work and just want to sleep.  I am also starting to feel depressed.  My jaw also hurts and I often find my self clenching my teeth.  I think while I sleep I am clenching them and it may cause the headache.,It really did help my heartburn issues.  After just 5 days I went from barely able to eat to being able to eat a greasy cheeseburger and fries.It is only day 6 of my prescribed 2 weeks of use.

1083, 2, GERD,I have been taking Prilosec on and off for a few years and recently started experiencing side effects. I had started taking Prilosec back in July.  After being on it a month I started experiencing extreme sharp abdominal pains_ depression_ weight gain_ back pain_ blurred vision and anxiety.  Dr. ran a CT scan and it showed an inflammed pancreas.  At the time I was unaware of the side effects of Prilosec. I stopped taking prilosec because I felt that it was no longer working.  Dr. perscribed Aciphex.  Interestingly enough symptoms disappeared.  Dr. ordered a MRI of the pancreas as a secondary test.  This occured 2 weeks after original CT scan.  Pancreas was fine and I am still symptom free. The DR. had no idea why I had an inflammed pancreas.  2 weeks ago after experiencing GERD again_ I tried prilosec.  Again the symptoms reoccurred.  I put 2 and 2 together_ googled prilosec's side effects and the rest is history. Needless to say I will avoid Prilosec from now on.,,F,36,1  months,3/3/2008,Prilosec

I have trouble swallowing_ and I cough at the drop of a hat_ and choke_ and my singing voice is compromised...cracks easily.  Prilosec was helping _ I thought_ but then I started having diarrhea all the time_ a case that had no symptoms of sickness.  However_ so inconvenient!

Constant minor headache.,I've been taking this for almost 2 years on doctors orders.  I asked about the max 14 days and he said not a problem.  Any food at any time_ especially but not limited to chicken_ rice_ french fries can close my throat down without warning.  That means no swallowing even water or no burping to relieve pressure.  I've had my throat expanded twice with good results the second time.  Tried Protonix before and after the first procedure but it didn't work well enough resulting in quickly returning problems and a second procedure a year later.  Without Prilosec daily (I skip days to test it) the acid reflux problem returns immediately.  The throat is scarring regardless.   Another procedure will have to be done but this stuff is buying me time.  Not liking taking them though.,M,56,2  years,2/24/2008,Prilosec

At night I woke up several times because of heartburn.I started taking Prilosec and the heartburn was gone in about 2 days. However I experienced very bad headaches during the treatment (3times in two weeks) which I never ever had before. The headache usually hit me in the middle of the night and wouldn ́t go away even after taking two Ibuprofen (200mg each). Additionally my upper back and shoulders hurt really bad too_ so I couldn ́t lay down anymore. So I spend about half the night sleeping in a sitting position with a really bad headache.

Gets worse with a tremor feeling_ like your constantly on a large dose of MSG. Problems sleeping_ loss of sex drive. Very sudden wake ups with anxiety attacks which I never have when I'm off the stuff.,This drug has so many side effects it's hard to depend on when you need it. I use it to stop bouts of bad stomach distress which lasts days for me. But after 5 days I have to stop taking the drug. I tried one pill every other day but it still gives me trouble. I was treated for H pylori virus a little over 2 years ago_ but I believe it has returned. So I will be tested next week and probably put back on another proton inhibitor like Prilocec.

After being on it continually for a year these are sideeffects I developed.  Thinking the gerd was getting worse they increased the prilosec but actually I think these were caused by the prilosec.  Also these symptoms I was having can be from Vitamin B deficient which my doctor told me I was deficient and started me on a vitamin. I believe Prilosec causes vitamin B dificient.

1096, 5, GERD,None.  This has been a great drug for me.,After 8 years_ a recent blood test flagged me as Vitamin B12 deficient.  Research showed that B12 is broken down from the animal proteins we eat_ and the acid in the stomach is needed for this to happen.  So does long term use of PPI drugs bring this on?  I read where there is no hard connection of this as of yet.  Am now taking a B12 supplement as of 4 days ago.,M,44,8  years,2/15/2008,Prilosec

It is unfortunate that the mfg. doesn't list these as possible side effects. I really think this drug should be pulled. Hate it! I have discontinued it and feel like myself again. I know without a shadow of a doubt that every symptom I experienced was from the Prilosec. I took it one time for two months and didn't make the association with symptoms.

I had already begun weaning myself from Chantix (In my opinion a drug that should have never been approved).Doctor claimed that what I was experiencing was not a side effect of Prilosec and said to up the dose.

After starting the medication I slept a bit better and the pain on the left side of my abdomen was relieved. But I just felt weird. (Can't describe it.) After 18 days I discontinued. And that's when I got actual GERD symptoms: acid reflux_ regurgitation_ intense heartburn_ pain and tightness in chest_ palpitations_ extreme anxiety. (I'd wake up at midnight feeling like I was going to die.) A couple of times I thought I was having a heart attack and went to the ER. So_ my doctor put me back on Prilosec--to relieve the symptoms caused by the Prilosec. The next day I had a full-blown gall bladder attack. Once again_ I stopped.

1146, 3, Acid Reflux,Hairloss_ some food goes through my system undigested.,I saw a naturopathic Dr and he said that hairloss was because my system was not properly breaking down amino acids(protiens). He gave me several types of enzymes to take daily to help digestion. I am also taking pro-biotics to replenish my system with good bacteria.Trouble digesting food could be a signal of not eating the foods with digestive enzymes (raw fruits and vegetables for instance). This could lead to poor nutrition because one's body cannot digest food at full capacity.  Prilosec cuts down on acid but compromises the bodies ability to metabolize food.  I have found that some food goes through undigested.  I called the pharmacy about this and the pharmacist said there was nothing in their material that would support that side effect though.Anyway_ it is important to take vitamins and calcium if you are on Prilosec.

1182, 5, Severe acid reflux,On-off diharrea_ weight gain.,I started taking omeprazole 17 years ago because of severe acid reflux I ignored until my esophagus shut down.  Taking it changed my life.  I cannot quit taking it but I have learned through the years that I can usually take 20mg every 2 or 3 days.  After that simptoms return.  I have gained about 40 pounds and have to deal with episodes of diharrea (I do not know if these are actually side effects because I have not been able to stop taking it).  I have exercised more or less regularly.  When I diet and only eat healthy food_ I can usually space the 20mg to about twice a week_ but not more.  I also have noticed that I can take prilosec less often if I do not eat any wheats (no bread_ pasta_ etc).  My main concern is not being able to lose the weight and would love to find out if this is related to the medicine.,M,48,17  years,8/2/2007,Prilosec

1189, 5, Gerd & Gastroenteritis,As I am also on maintainance dosage of Klonopin; a known interaction: increased sedation occured. My Psychiatrist & I are working with adjusted dosages of Klonopin as result. Other Side Effects: At first had headaches_ some stomach pain and mood swings (maybe result of Klonopin interaction). These side effects have basically abated after 1 week of OTC/20mg 2x per day. What remains is feeling of lump in throat_ pills feel like they're getting stuck in throat and some emotional irritability and mild flu-like fatigue remain.,I took Nexium for 5 years until it stopped working; tried trial of Aciphex: agony! Severe stomach cramping and fatigue. Then_ Prevacid: after initial headaches and stomach cramping & fatigue stopped acid but not consistently; bright yellow stool had me concerned. Despite Dr's. assurances about this my instinct said NO.....stop the Prevacid. It wasn't 100% effective with my acid anyway. So_ I decided to try my last resort; Prilosec OTC: Stopped GERD completely. No acid! Just some side effects I'm hoping will stop after becoming more accustomed. My Gastroenterologist has ordered an Esophagram to be sure feeling of pills getting stuck is just feeling and not reality.....have read that most PPI's can also cause this side effect. I'll know more next week. Good luck everyone; I know how GERD can cause tremendous suffering; I have gotten the better part of the acid relief; now to fine-tune the rest.,M,57,6  days,7/18/2007,Prilosec

Very soon after beginning I started having severe depression_ extreme fatigue_ severe headaches_ heart racing_ and then started having numbness in my right leg approximately 3 weeks after starting Prilosec.  Two and 1/2 months after beginning I called my doctor and told him the Prilosec had not helped the problem_ he wanted me to take it 6 more months (I stopped it that day).  The day after stopping Prilosec I had full right sided numbness (thought I was having a stroke).  Went to my doctor who sent me to ER for CAT SCAN (Negative).  Sent to Neurologist (who I told I thought my symptoms were from the Prilosec)_ he disagreed saying he thought I had Multiple Sclerosis and ordered MRI's which were negative.  I was sent for Cardiac workup_ to an endocrinologist_,Anyone taking any H Proton Pump Inhibitor (Acid Reducer) should have their B-12 checked.

I'm not sure which I like less: the constant heartburn or the aches and pains I experience with the medicine.  Does anyone know why the drug is only supposed to be taken for the 14 days?

If you can manage to take this without the side effects_ I imagine it is quite useful.  I was taking Prilosec_ then Zegerid (basically Prilosec X 2 + Sodium Bicarbonate)_ then went back to Prilosec.

I've been very depressed_ upset_ crying and it makes you feel as if you just want to run away and hope all your feelings of uncertainty would just disappear. It makes you feel bloated_ chest tightening_ coughing & loose stool.,I can explain this feeling_ but I know for a fact that it's not a feeling anyone would want to experience. I suggest very highly that if anyone is thinking about trying this medication_ think again.  This may work for some people_ but why take the chance_ after all; look at the number of people with the same side affects.,F,50,5  days,6/19/2007Email,Prilosec
1202, 1, ACID REFLUX,Extreme depression_ migraine headaches_ weakness in legs and arms_ crying effusively_ tightening of the chest as if your going to have a heart attack_ loss of appetite_ and very gassy.,I've been on Prilosec for the past 5 days now and I can't even begin to explain how I've been feeling.  It's a feeling of uncertainty.  All I can say is_ if you ever decide to take this medication_ on the first day if you have any changes in your personality and you start feeling differently about life_ about yourself and about everything around you_ then I strongly suggest you stop that same day.  It is a feeling that I hear of people who commits suicide.  Meaning: A unexplainable feeling of depression that can really affect your own stability.  This is how I've been feeling.  Trust your own self and trust that what you can and can not tolerate.  After all:  every one's different and we all function differently. So what may not work for me_ may work for you_ but watch the first day.,F,50,5  days,6/19/2007Email,Prilosec

I had the same reaction about 3 months ago when traveling and thought it was a severe case of food poisining.  Stopped taking Prilosec due to feeling so bad but did not put 2 and 2 together until I started taking it again and had the same reaction.  I then decided to look at the side effects and found this site.  Once I read the comments_ I am now sure that the stomach pain is a side effect of taking Prilosec and will stop immediately.,Although the drug helped my heartburn it was mild compared to the side effects.  Other members of my family have taken the drug with no side effect.  I would recommend this drug with extreme caution and suggest others research the side effects first.,F,59,2  days,6/18/2007,Prilosec

I'm going to stop taking it for a few days.  See if there is a change in the symptoms and see how bad the heart burn is without it.  I was on Zegerid which is basically Prilosec X 2 with sodium bicarb mixed in.  Symptoms seem to have lessened after going back to Prilosec.

I could not stop crying for hours. About 10 hours after taking the pill_ the pain in my right side decreased measurably_ but I can't bring myself to wake up tomorrow and take another of these pills. I don't know what I'm going to do to get rid of the pain (vague diagnosis came after an endoscopy this week; awaiting biopsy results)_ but I can't function on Prilosec_ that's for sure.,The patient package insert should mention this side effect.

It's back to Provacid for me_ although I'm also going to start working out in hopes of loosing weight_ which I believe will help. I took Provacid for two years without any problems_ until my perscription ran out and I thought I would try Prilosec OTC. What a mistake! Prilosec is a bad joke.

Note: it is effectively the same as Nexium so don't waste your money on Nexium (or your insurance carrier if covered). Nexium was just a way for the manufacturer to profit on patent expiration of Prilosec. I sat in on a sales seminar for Pharma Salesguys_ and it is only a few molocules different_ only to get past patent expiration_ and has no real differences from an efficacy perspective. Don't waste your money on Nexium and the marketing hype. Just take OTC Prilosec.,M,45,10  years,6/6/2007,Prilosec

I am concerned about the other side effects many have said they have_ too. I think if I don't get some relief overnight from this bloating I will not be taking this tomorrow morning.  I will just play it by ear for now. I have not had ""hunger"" pains that were from the acid and not actual hunger_ which helps me to lose some weight_ but the bloating is seriously not worth it_ which is what I was already having!

Which all ultimately lead to severe Depression!,Prilosec worked great for my GERD problems; however_I began to experience light versions of the side effects as mentioned in the side effects section. My doctor and I thought perhaps these symptoms might be related to my hiatal hernia; so he recommended that I increase the dosage to 2  20mg pills a day( One in the morning and another before dinner in the evening).

Then I had stomach aches.  They would come in waves - very intense stomach pain and then go completely away.  This lasted 3 days.  Once I stopped the medicine it got better quickly.  The pain would get worse after eating_ to the point where I thought i would vomit.  But then it would go away.  It also helped to have a bowel movement but oddly enough_ I didn't feel like I had to do so_ I just sat and waited and pushed that process along because I thought it would make me feel better.  Also_ my bm's were hard to get out AND were pencil thin.  Very bizarre.  Yes_ the heartburn was gone but it wasn't worth what I went through with the side effects.,If you start experiencing any side effects from this medicine_ I would stop it right away - because I went through a wave of side effects over 5 days and had I stopped it once I got the first round of side effects_ perhaps I wouldn't have suffered the other days!,F,37,5  days,1/13/2007,Prilosec

1271, 1, Acid Reflux_ H. Pylori_ Gastritis,I felt like a mental health case_ experiencing severe anxiety that was leading to depression.  Suffering from vision problems_ headaches and tight neck and shoulder pain_ probably due to the hypertension  it seemed to be giving me. It felt like I was hyped up on caffeine.  I also had trouble getting to sleep_ once asleep I was more inclined to have vivid dreams_ as mentioned by others. These side effects were hideous.,Prilosec worked incredibly well in eliminating the acid reflux I was experiencing.  The trouble I had_ swallowing_ dissipated and so did the abdominal pain I felt after consuming spicy or fatty foods.  However_ when advised_ by my doctor_ to increase the dosage of omeprazole from 20mg to 40mg the anxiety went through the roof.  So too did the headaches and blurriness of vision that had grown progressively worse since I began taking the medication. 4 days ago I ceased taking this medication and am already noticing a vast improvement.  I take no other medication so I can clearly attribute this improvement to the removal of omeprazole from my life.  Although I seem to be experiencing acid reflux again in my throat_ this is a small price to pay for the anti depressant drugs my doctor was likely to prescribe for me_ to address symptoms brought about by another drug.,M,31,3  days,1/2/2007,Prilosec

Now I am experiencing constant fatigue_ and a nagging localized muscle-like pain mid-back on the right side_ by the wing bone.  I do not know for sure that these are caused by Prilosec_ but I suspect this strongly.  After reading the entries here yesterday I started taking 1000 mg of B12 daily.  (I researched this and on the Website for American Family Physicians_ found a research article saying that a minimum of 500 mg of B12 can more or less circumvent the absorption problem caused by Prilosec.  I also found an article on PeoplesPharmacy.com saying that cranberry juice can help with this.)  I am contemplating cutting those OTC tablets in half to see if halving the dose_ 10 mg twice a day_ would still help my GERD_ but I don't know if this can be done without wrecking the coating on the tablets.  I'll ask a pharmacist.,It has helped the GERD symptoms totally.  I had a baby esophagal ulcer and lots of esophagal irritation.

Diarreah and vomiting also.  Though that it was the stomach flu.  After 4-5 days my symptoms started to subside. Began to take the pills again after not taking them during what I thought was stomach flu.  Spent the next day in the emergency room with severe abdominal pain.   Doctors could not determine cause so diagnosed me with gastroenteritis.  After stopping to take prilosec no more symptoms have surfaced.,Absolutely cured my heartburn totally while taking it.

I felt like I had a cold or the flu but body temp was totally normal. On the 1st day attempting to come off Prilosec I was VERY emotional.

At 6 months_ doctor dismissed dryness as unimportant. Other symptons: tooth enamel decay (which I've never suffered with_ is this the candy?)_ depression_ lethargy_ sudden urges to go the bathroom sometimes only resulting in gas and sometimes not(!)_ recent short term memory loss which my family have noticed (which I put down to age!).

1288, 1, GERD,The only fender benders I've ever had_ I had while on Prilosec. It's an antihistamine_ it makes me stupid; just a little stupid_ but it shows.  P eliminates stomach acid_ therefore makes digesting calcium impossible - if you're post menopausal_ this is a disaster; if you're not_ your nervous system needs CA_ not just bones. I have a GERD cough for a year; the P doesn't help it. I've taken it on and off for years following surgeries with pain killers and antibiotics galore destroying my gut.   P. suppresses the immune system.

1289, 2, Severe_ frequent  heartburn,I have experienced frequent_ severe heartburn for several years.  I have relied upon antiacids as treatment.  I take no medication but am being treated for anemia_ likely caused from giving blood too frequently (every 2 months for several years).  My doctor prescribed a colonoscopy and endoscopy_ both of which were negative.  At my doctor's direction_ I am taking an OTC iron pill that has corrected the anemia. Prilosec completely eliminated the heartburn but I experienced frequent bouts of fatigue_ usually lasting one to four hours but on occasion longer. The periods of fatigue were usually daily experiences but there were some periods (2-3 days) that I did not experience the fatigue.  I have always had tons of energy and exercise daily_ walking at least 4 miles per day.  The fatigue is not so severe that I am unable to exercise but the feeling is inconsistent with the quality of life I have experienced for years.  I have also gained weight_ about 6-8 lbs.,Good medication but I do not like the side-effect.  I plan to discuss with my doctor and may alter my diet and revert to the antiacids.,M,68,60  days,11/13/2006,Prilosec

I was miserable when I had to stop taking Prilosed while I was pregnant.  My GERD also inflames my sinuses and has caused sinus problems or ear imbalance when bad.  Prilosec has controlled and prevented these sinus and ear symptoms in addition to my GERD.  I have found I can stop taking it once I have my GRED under control AND if I watch what I eat.  However_ as soon as I start eating greasy food_ chocolates_ or caffeine; I will need to start taking PRILOSEC again for at least two weeks.,F,39,5  years,11/7/2006,Prilosec

I am also curious now if some of my short term memory loss could be attributed to Prilosec... people have started to call me Dory at work - maybe I'm just getting old?,I have been on a lot of different drugs to solve these problems.  I was completely normal 8 years ago_ then I had an inceident with food getting caught in my throat.  Been through many different meds over the years (don't recall anxiety).

Heart Burn Gone 100%. Within a day or so I started noticing some chest discomfort that seem to intensify a little more each day After a week on priosec I stopped taking it and I went into to see the doc.. We decided to try Previcid. I experienced the same side effects.    As I type this message Ive been on Prevacid about a week and will not continue. Last night the chest discomfort was to a level that I had thoughts of going to the emerg. room. I finally made myself burp and felt somewhat better. As I type the chest pain is mild but noticeable.     I know from when I stopping the Prilosec that the chest pains did not immediately subside_ it took a couple of days.   Prilosec and Prevacid did knock out heart burn very well,M,42,14  days,10/28/2006Email,Prilosec

I am not an anxious person and have never had any kind of anxiety before.  This was all very bizzare to me.,I had been taking RX Prilosec for years before it changed to OTC without any problems.  It was after Prilosec went OTC that I experienced these problems.  I stopped taking the prilosec 3 days ago and the palpitations seem to be coming less now.  I really hope they stop all together soon.,M,36,8  years,10/15/2006,Prilosec
1300, 3, GERD,I noticed no side effects until about five years into treatment.  I started having scary short term memory problems_ tingling feet.  I had standard blood work for a physical(a year ago_ 2005) and my doctor asked me if anemia ran in my family.  He said it was not severe_ but it was present.  The memory problems got worse_ and I ran out of Prilosec recently_ so I looked up the danger of going cold turkey.  I discovered the B12 deficiency problems with Prilosec.  READ UP ON THIS IF YOU ARE USING PRILOSEC FOR 4+ YEARS. I also have spent the last two years getting heart tests from palpitations_ and I have had a persistent cough for years.  I ignored the cough because I had sinus drip as a kid.  Cough is gone since discontinuation.  The cardiologist attributed my palpitations to anxiety.  I am taking 2000mcg of b12 for the next seven days.  I feel much clearer_ and my only fix for the heart burn is to eat nothing bigger than my fist at one sitting.  I am very hungry_ but it is better than he,Prilosec is effective_ but our doctors need to do a better job of taking the b12 issue seriously.,M,32,1825  days,10/14/2006Email,Prilosec

I had to sleep on the couch because the bed was shaking so hard my poor husband couldn't sleep.,I didn't expect problems from this - the pack makes it sound like a side-effect-free wonder drug. It's not. I only took two pills_ felt the effects_ and THEN read about them here... DH thought I was depressed because the prilosec didn't solve my sleep problem_ but that wasn't it.  I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown this week_ but now the prilosec's out of my system I feel a thousand times better! It cut down my stomach acid - too well! Do NOT take this med if you have problems with digestion or anxiety/depression. One plus - it did reduce the acid and prevent night-time choking.

I have been evaluated by a cardiologist - he says something else was causing the problems.  The endocrinologist figured out I had anemia_ which was causing me to have severe LOW blood pressure.  I finally thought to try by not taking Prilosec anymore.  Most of the symptoms have resolved -- my doctor says it may take a while for the remaining symptoms to resolve_ since I took the medication for 1 year.

I am now experiencing constipation again and wonder if Prilosec is the cause.,"I googled the web for side effects of Prilosec because I finally got chronic constipation under control after many years of experimenting with how to get rid of it.  The constipation came back at approximately the same time I started taking Prilosec.  I don't know if the Prilosec is causing the constipation_ but I can't go off it long enough to find out.  The Priolosec has gotten rid of about 99% of the chest pain I was experiencing. (Pain was so bad_ I went to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack.) Going one day without taking it and the pain comes back. A previous contributor mentioned natural remedies for acid reflux and said that Vit. A promotes healing of the stomach lining.  For the last 15 years or so_ I have taken Vit. A for antioxident properties but only recently stopped because some ""expert"" said taking it on a regular basis wasn't good for you.

Cannot take N.S.A.I.D's due to them aggravating the acid problem so it's a vicious cyle. Also mild depression became severe depression the longer I was on Prilosec. Also anxiety and messed up sleep. Severe hot flashes. Felt as if I was going through menopausal symptoms all over again.,After taking Prilosec for one month the severe heart burn pains eased up. Over time though one capsule did not control it any longer and my Dr upped my dose to two capsules per day. Was now having twice the side-effects which made my life impossible.

No anxiety but more dreams and harder to go back to sleep if I wake. Tired of having to keep the bathroom in sight. I'll probably go back to popping Rolaids if this keeps up.

There is some research to suggest the Prilosec may cause this. I was referred to a hematologist who had me stop taking the Prilosec. Within 2 months my platelets are up to 90 and rising. I have no doubt this was caused by the Prilosec. The only other medication I am taking is Actos. I am now using Pepcid for the acid reflux. Nowhere near as effective.

I took it in the morning and by 7:30P the reaction to Prilosec got eliminated.,Under no cirumstances I will try it again.  I have red the comments of sour stomach safferers that are available on this page.  The following are my thoughts regarding what else can be done to improve quality of life of those who suffer from acid reflax:1) everybody most likely have to define the selection of foods that are best tolerated by digestive tract_ 2) learn to eat slowly_ and small portion_ that is stomach can handle amount of food of a size of one hand_ 4-5- small meals per day_ 3) drink water all the time because it dilutes acid but also eliminates everything what should be out from the system_ 4)banana are some of the best remedies for sour stomach because it is rich in Potasium_ an alkalinizing mineral_ and vit.A_ 5) foods rich in vitA such as carrots and avocado are highly recommended because vitA promotes healing of lining of the stomach (daily dose estimated 100_00U0_ 6)other components such as zinc_ selenium_ silica_ CoQ help to heal stomach wall_ 7) old remedies su,F,55,1  days,7/13/2006Email,Prilosec
1336, 1, Frequent Heartburn,Depression_ Weight Gain ( Six sizes weight gain) Joint Pain_ Back Pain_ Leg Pain_ Coughing_ Anxiety_ Lack of Energy.,I had been going to the Chiropractor for the pain in my Back and Legs_ when I started thinking about when it all started. So I stopped taking the Prilosec and in 4 day's had already lost 1 pants size and by day 6 had no back pain and the Joint Pain is almost a memory from the past. I was taking it on my doctors advise and she even put me up to 2 a day for 2 months. This is when everything got worse and I could barely walk because of the pains in my legs and joints. It did ease the Heartburn some of the time but not always. SO I now have full time Heartburn but in all I feel fantastic now that I am no longer taking the medication.,F,51,2  years,7/11/2006,Prilosec
1337, 1, Acid Reflux,It cured my acid reflux however after about 5 days on Prilosec OTC I began having dull headaches_ difficulty concentrating at work and suffered what I believe was an anxiety attack.  I thought I was headed for the emergency room with a stroke but the episode subsided.  I also began feeling very lightheaded in the mornings.....almost like I was sea sick. It finally dawned on me to check the possible side effects of Prilosec since it's the only med I was on.  I was shocked and relieved to see so many others with similar issues.  I will not be finishing my 14 day regimen.,Just because it's now available over the counter doesn't mean it's completely safe.  People need to be better informed about these side effects.

My insurance does cover it if the Dr. writes a script for it_ but wow reading all these side effects sure has scared me_ but my attacks were so bad made him give me an E.K.G and a stress test_ which were fine.

Also was having problems with swallowing because of esophigal scarring (Barrett's Syndrom) from too much acid reflux.  Please note that I am not overweight_ watch what I eat and work out every day.  My doctor suggested Prilosec OTC 20mg and within 5-6 hours my pain completely vanished (unbelievable!).  I have also noted that I haven't had any problems with swallowing since I've been on this medication.  Only negative side effect has been occasional slight headaches (took a couple of Advil).

However_ the side effect of decreased bowel control outweighs the benefits (as great as they are)_ so I have discontinued its use.  After one week_ the side effects are clearing up_ but the acid reflux pain is back with a vengeance.  If Prilosec OTC came in a 1/2 strength_ that would probably control my acid reflux with less problem ""down below""_ but I don't think it does_ and you're advised not to cut the pills in half.  What's a girl to do?",F,55,6  months,8/27/2005,Prilosec
1396, 2, Sore Oseophogus,Servere Anxiety_ shaking_ it was probably the closest to having a bad 3 day acid trip that I will ever have.  Had to go to emergency room for sedative shot.  Called about 10 pharmacies and 3 doctors to be told this was not a known side effect of Prilosec_ but according to other patients on this page_ it is.,,F,37,3  days,8/22/2005,Prilosec
1397, 1, Laryngeal Acid Reflux,No side effects_ but no relief!,I have chronic laryngeal acid reflux which_ in addition to causing extreme_ unrelenting coughing_ puts me at a super high esophageal cancer risk. The treatment for LPR (laryngeal-pharyngeal reflux) is 2 doses of a PP2 inhibitor a day. I was successfully on Nexium_ but  you can imagine the high cost at 2x a day. I switched to Prilosec when it went over the counter_ and was on it for 3 months. My symptoms returned and I couldn't believe it was the Prilosec because my doctor had told me it was the same molecule as Nexium - just the mirror image side of the molecule! (Same doctor also told me people sometimes metabolize Nexium and Priolosec differently).  I got really sick and was bed-ridden for a while_ then wized up and got a new prescription for Nexium. As soon as I went back on the Nexium_ I returned to normal.,F,31,2  months,8/21/2005,Prilosec
1398, 1, acid reflux/ulcerated esophougys,A horrible headache_ blurred vision and dizzieness.,I felt like a lab rat_ so I stopped taking it. I'd rather suffer from heartburn then feel like an experiment.,M,56,2  days,8/9/2005,Prilosec
1399, 3, stomach ulcers,I get tearful_ nearly crying_ tense_ stressed_ pessimistic and frustrated after meals (really) as the medicine is preventing me from making acid. General itching_ prickly_ sharp burning muscle pains everywhere_ uneasy feeling in stomach_ diarrhea throughout the day.,It certainly helps my ulcers to heal temporarily.  I have far less belching now.  But I end up back on it after every couple of months; I may need to watch my diet more closely.  I have Fibromyalgia and was doing rather well_ with only mild general pain until I had to take Prilosec again.,F,30,3  days,8/2/2005,Prilosec
1400, 4, acid reflux,I am not sure it's due to Prilosec_ but I have gained about 15 pounds since being on it (and I was already overweight beforehand).  I no longer have the nausea_ but still have heartburn occasionally.,Anyone else experience symptoms of weight gain since taking Prilosec (not because you weren't eating before_ because I was)?  Maybe the lack of stomach acid means the food is not properly digested and so causes weight gain?,F,45,11  months,7/22/2005,Prilosec
1401, 2, Stomach pain_ burning,Headache_ nausea_ SEVERE ANXIETY,I was unable to take Prilosec long enough to see if it would work for my stomach problems.  It gave me such severe anxiety and nervousness_ I could barely function.  I was told by my doctor to stop taking it.,F,29,2  days,7/20/2005,Prilosec

1404, 5, Chronic GERD,Occasional bloating_ but not for sure caused by the drug.,Life saver.  I had been taking Aciphex_ but at $145/30 day supply_ ugh!  I can take Prilosec OTC once every two to three days for complete relief.  I read where the only reason they don't want you to take it for more than 14 days_ every 4 months_ is some long term studies in rats indicated a slightly higher risk of stomach cancer.  Well_ my GERD is so bad_ that I am at high risk for esophogial cancer.  Rather have a slightly higher risk of stomach cancer_ and complete relief from the GERD symptoms!  I do find if I go off it for more than a few days_ all symptoms return_ so I just take it every two or three days_ and probably will for the rest of my life.  Great med!,F,50,45  days,5/24/2005,Prilosec
1405, 4, too much acid in stomach,dull headache,I have only been taking Prilosec OTC one day but this dull headache appeared after only 6 hrs on this medication. The headache is driving me a little crazy but that awful gnawing and burning sensation in the upper left quadrant of my body has pretty much disappeared. I talked to my pharmacist today and told him my symptoms and that Zantac 150mg was not helping and he suggested Prilosec OTC. Just hope the headache doesn't hang around.,F,36,1  days,5/18/2005,Prilosec

1412, 2, chronic stomach pain,Depression_ stiff neck with pain_ headaches_ profound cramps_ nausea_ can't focus,I started with 10 mg_ worked well but when I stopped after 14 days_ symptoms return with a vengance.  Wait 4 months_ same thing.  Asked Doctor who said take it all the time_ not just 14 days - but I'm afraid.  I've tried the 20 mg_ but the side effects are too profound for me.  I can't find the 10 mg in the stores anymore?,M,49,1  years,2/17/2005,Prilosec

Loose stools (not to the point of diarrhea_ but close at times) and flatulence.,My doctor initially had me on samples of Protonix_ which worked great_ but when I filled my own prescription_ the $105 for a 30 day supply seemed pretty excessive_ so he switched me to Prilosec OTC as an alternative.  Prilosec is working great for the reflux problem_ but my neck_ arms and upper legs have been very sore since I started using the drug.,M,40,14  days,2/11/2005,Prilosec

1419, 5, Hernia and acid reflux,None,I love Prilosec.  Prior to taking Prilosec even water gave me painful heartburn.  I had to sleep sitting up and still ended up vomiting many nights.  I have used both Prevacid and Prilosec...they are both good medicines. I'm not sure I could live without it I hope it stays on the market.,F,57,8  years,11/20/2004,Prilosec
1420, 1, acid reflux from hiatal hernia,headaches_ back pain_ sore ankles_ hives on feet_ depression_ heart palpitations_ high blood pressure_ chest pain_ tingling in left arm,I had no problems with Nexium when I took it.  But I ran out and I tried to control my disease with diet_ but it was not working.  Rather than go back to the doctor_ which was like pulling teeth to get Nexium_ I started on Prilosec OTC_ taking it sporadically.  I went to the doctor because I was having some strange symptoms and got the full workup and found nothing to do with my heart.  Then he suggested I increase my dosage of prilosec to 20 mg 2x a day and things got exponentially worse.  Debilitating side effects_ including severe depression.  Seems to have subsided with stopping the medication_ but I will have to keep an eye on my BP to be sure it goes back to normal.,F,32,6  months,11/1/2004,Prilosec

1425, 2, Acid reflux_ mucous in throat,I'm sure I fall within the 1% who experienced debilitating side-effects with Prilosec_ but the cramping and diarrhea I had were as bad as the worst traveller's diarrhea you've ever experienced.  Entire days were spent in the bathroom.  It was so bad_ I was sure I had a parasite_ since I couldn't believe that an ostensibly safe and approved over-the-counter drug could make me so sick.  My internist actually requested a stool culture to test for a parasite_ but there was none. Another tricky aspect of the diarrhea was that it would remit after each episode_ and for a couple of days I thought I was over it.  But it always returned with a vengeance.  Once I stopped the Prilosec_ the diarrhea also stopped_ although it took 2 or 3 days to get everything out of my system.,The good news is that the Prilosec did more to help my acid reflux symptoms than any other drug I'd tried.  Unfortunately it's not an option for me to continue on the drug.,,50,40  days,8/28/2004,Prilosec

I thought that the problems I was having were caused by some of the foods I ate and not the drug. Things got worse and I ended up stopping it altogether after reading about its side effects on the web.  I now watch what I eat_ have lost weight and feel 100% better.
