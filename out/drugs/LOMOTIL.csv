6, 5, IBS,If I take more than the recommended dosage_ I experience dry mouth/eyes.,This miracle drug gave me my life back. From the ages of 19 through 28_ I feared leaving the house due to chronic diarrhea. I would go anywhere from 4-8 times a day. I nearly lost my job from calling out or being late in the morning because I couldn't leave the bathroom. It was awful. Since my GI started me on Lomotil_ it has gone away almost completely. The only bouts I suffer from are usually viral or from overeating greasy food. This pill_ 2x a day_ has changed my life.,F,35,6  years25mg 2X D,5/23/2014Email,Lomotil

10, 5, ,Mild bloating_ occasional constipation.,I started taking it several years ago due to diarrhea from being in nervous situations.  What a Godsend.  It helped me relax and not have to worry about panicking when I could not find a bathroom right away. I don't take it on a daily basis and the most I usually take is 2 tabs once daily.,,46,20  years,6/27/2009Email,Lomotil
11, 5, Severe IBS-D,Dry mouth,"Absolute ""godsend"".  I had the worst case of IBS my specialist had ever seen. (8-12 severe bouts of diarehha a day.)  I hadn't left my house for 6 months at that point - couldn't leave home without extreme panic attacks.  Just 2 tiny pills in the morning stops my diarrhea_ cramps_ gas_ everything!

12, 4, crohns disease_ fistula..3 surgerie,fatitgue_ dry mouth_ blurred vision_ dizziness,I have taken lomotil consistently for 4 years after my last surgery.  I have taken as many as 8 a day_ 2 at a time with each meal.  The side effects are taking its toll so I am going to look for something different_ like cholysterimine (sp)again.,M,46,4  years,4/16/2009Email,Lomotil
13, 5, IBS,None,I really like Lomotil.  I used to take Bentyl but it didn't work very well.  The only thing I dislike is having to take pills several times a day (at least twice).  It works pretty quickly and I feel pretty safe being away from restrooms as long as I have taken a couple of doses.,F,36,7  months,9/8/2008,Lomotil
14, 5, constant diarreaha,fine for first 2 years_ since then experienced variety of curious problems that have no answer. I've been depressed to the point of bringing on panic attacks. I didnt know what they were so went into partial paralysis with severe pins and needles to the extreme of pulling car over and was found on side of dual carraigeway by bikers in complete mess! Now can be very moody and depressed easily and feel panic attack starting but now can control easily with breathing exercise.,,M,40,3  years,3/19/2008,Lomotil

17, 3, diarrhea,euphoria_ constipation_moderate abdominal pain,13 mths ago I came down w/ IBS; the first 3 mths. it was d-dominant and PCP prescribed Lomotil. The rx was for 2 tabs 3 times a day; I got so stoned I couldn't move; next day pleasant hangover but very constipated! I then took only two a day_ which didn't stop d but minimized it (once in a.m..)I read up on Lomotil and no surprise it contained a mild opiate. The Dr. overprescribed_ gave me 60 tabs with 4 refills!My IBS became more c-dominant after 3 mths so I only take about 2 lomotil a mth for occasional d.I still have 10 tabs left from 2nd refill after a yr. Lomotil IMPOSSIBLE to take for kicks or any reason other than d. The atropine will cramp you.,M,55,90  days,8/31/2007,Lomotil
18, 5, diareaha,None,Works great- I only take it occasionally- when needed.,F,36,5  years,5/18/2007,Lomotil
19, 1, Severe Diarrhea,Dry mouth_ drowsiness_ those went away. Then PANCREATITIS that because I was taking the lomotil for extended peiod of time turned into chronic pancreatitis.,Be VERY careful_ if you have ANY abdominal pain_ stop taking it and tell your doctor,F,32,4  years,8/24/2006,Lomotil
20, 4, IBS-D,Dry mouth_ fatigue_ and nausea if I take more than one dose in an 8 hour period.,In combination with Imodium_ it keeps my IBS-D under control.  I take one pill in the AM and one at bedtime.  I've tried cutting back_ but the diarrhea & cramping return.,M,46,10  years,2/9/2006,Lomotil
21, 5, IBS-D,Slight nausea in the beginning_ slighly drowzy_ dry mouth_ but not as bad as imodium,Works great_ no cramping like with imodium_ no adverse reaction as I have had more than once with imodium,M,35,12  months,8/13/2005,Lomotil
22, 5, IBS-D,No side effects whatsoever_ except it took away all my IBS symptoms_ including cramping_ gas and diarrhea. So far_ so good. It's been just a few days and something had to change because I was taking almost 100 Imodium every two weeks. Just a little dry mouth was the only side effect but I can live with that_ compared to the other symptoms of IBS-D(,It's just too bad you need a WRITTEN prescription for this medication and that your doctor can't call a new one in. I think it's because of the narcotic ingredient_ even though it is on such a miniscule amount. Oh well. To me_ it will be worth the time and visit and I'll ask for more so I won't have to go back for a new prescription. However_ with my prescription plan I have to be half-way through my Rx before they will refill. So I'll have to wait 15 days before filling another Rx. But that's ok.,F,50,3  days,4/16/2005,Lomotil
