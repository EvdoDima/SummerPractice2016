0, 5, HRT,None,After using the brand name for many years_ I recently started using the generics.  Three months of the Mylan brand and for a month now on Sandoz.  Both generic brands have worked just as well as Vivelle-Dot.  Only reason I like the Mylan brand more is because they made the rigid protective liner larger than the patch.  Makes it easier to remove from the patch from the liner.,F,57,7  years.0375 2X W,7/31/2016,Vivelle-dot
1, 5, HRT,If you experience itching and irritation where the patch is_ squirt a little Flonase (or similar nasal allergy spray) on the area and let dry prior to putting on the patch.  I had terrible itching from the patch and this solved the problem for me.,,F,57,6  years.0375 2X W,7/25/2016,Vivelle-dot
2, 4, Total hysterectomy 20 year ago,I have used this patch for years and loved it. However_ a generic is available so my insurance won't help as much. I have tried the generic last year and again now because of cost. I will be dishing out the money for the name brand as I have horrible side effects from the generic. Breast tenderness that is painful and depressing mood swings. I have tried this each year for the last 2 years and get the same result. Not worth it and frustrating that insurance now won't pay as well for name brand.,,F,59,10  years2x weekly,5/15/2016Email,Vivelle-dot

4, 1, hysterectomy/oophorectomy 2003,Was on brand name Vivelle-Dot for 12 years. Worked great! Insurance pharmacy sent GENERIC (by Sandoz) Vivelle-Dot patches for my recent batch (without consulting me or my MD). So I tried them and symptoms of menopause returned after 6 weeks. Finally I (recently) removed the patch from my body and did not replace and the fuzzy headedness cleared quite a bit within an hour. I won't put those on again. Horrible dullness of mind with intense sadness_ hot flashes_ and insomnia.,Today I requested Brand Name Vivelle-Dot from MD (which now requires prior authorization) and hope my insurance will continue to cover brand name as before. The GENERIC is just hitting the market. So watch your symptoms if you use the generic form of this patch. It is cheaper but may not manage menopausal symptoms as well as the brand name/non-generic Vivelle-dot. If it does work that is great because it is cheaper. But be aware.,F,66,12  years.05 2X W,5/19/2015Email,Vivelle-dot

14, 5, Post menopaus,I really and truly loved the Vivelle Dot...it has helped me so very much...had a complete hysterectomy and I have never felt so good in my life.  The only side effects I have are hormone migraines but not all the time.  When I change the patch I get a sever migraine with in an hour..this does not happen with every patch which makes me believe that the dosage is not very consistent. I also have been loosing hair on my head and getting much more on my face. All of that being said...I wish with all my heart they have not changed the Vivelle Dot to the Minivelle...I HATE the new Minevelle.  I am seriously considering changing to pills.  This patch is stated to be about the size of a Dime!  There is NO WAY! This patch is as big as a Quarter!  It doe NOT stick_ it slides and where it slides...it leaves a trail of the adhesive and where it has slid and not sticking_ it folds up and sticks to my cloths.  It doesn't even last a day on me before it starts to come unstuck and slides!  This is the,It doesn't stick! Slides and leaves trails of adhesive.  Folds up where the adhesive has come off and will sometimes stick to cloths. The glue is difficult to get off your skin. I need to use oils to get it all off and it irritates my skin where as the old Vivelle Dot did not...I hate the roundness of the new Minevelle patch...it is NOT as big as a dime...if it were it would be great but it IS as big as a quarter and there is a difference in those sizes!,F,60,6  years0.01 1X W,9/29/2014,Vivelle-dot

16, 5, hot flashes and menopausal issues,None. Brief itching at patch site - but that was until I figured out that skin has to be totally dry before applying. I stopped this med and was switched to combipatch due to concerns that extended use of vivelle dot alone would cause uterine lining problems or uterine cancer.,It is essential that your skin is 100% DRY before you put patch on_ or it will be very itchy. Women often apply patch after shower_ when skin is too moist. Wait 20 minutes after any water on skin and do not use cream or lotion.,F,50,1.5  years.025 2X H,9/10/2014,Vivelle-dot

20, 5, Total hysterectomy & oophorectomy,Breast tenderness.  Slight rash when removed,I was reluctant to start on any type of HRT following my hysterectomy at the age of 34.  Knowing that I would be on it long term_ was daunting_ and hearing all the stories about breast cancer_ made it even more scary.  I have had very little side effects from the patch.  Lately_ I have noticed some breast tenderness (almost feels like my milk is coming in).  If I forget to change the patch_ then I do get night sweats.  So far_ I have been very happy.  Having a hysterectomy changed my life.  I didn't realize how incredibly sick I was_ until I had it done.  I do recommend continuing to have yearly exams_ which is just a good practice anyway.,F,36,19  months.5 2X W,4/1/2014,Vivelle-dot
21, 5, Total hysterectomy -ovaries removed,Very mild nausea the first week.,Give this medication about a month for it to start fully working.  I had a total hysterectomy and my doctor made me wait a month before going on hormone replacement because I had severe endometriosis.  I thought the medication wasn't really working for me because I was still extremely fatigued to the point of barely functioning.  It started to kick in at about 3 weeks and my energy level came back to where it was before all the health problems started.

26, 4, Full Hysterectomy,It caused me to perspire at my bikini area.  ALOT.  Sometimes_ I still had night sweats.,Didn't stick during hot weather months like the summer.  Came off when I was sweaty which was embarrassing. Because one of my side effects was that it caused me to perspire in my bikini area_ I moved the patch to my behind.  Which was way more affective but often left slight rashes when removing.,F,35,1  years 1X O,3/30/2013,Vivelle-dot
27, 5, Complete hysterectomy at 48,After using the dot for 6 years_ something showed up on my mamogram last year.  The docs. could not identify it.  I had it biopsied and it was nothing.  Docs say your breast tissue gets more dense with hormone replacement therapy.,I have felt fantastic on this med. all these years.  You need to constantly monitor your health_ do daily breast exams_ etc. and go to doc. if you ever suspect a problem.  I go to an endocrinologist every 3 - 6 months for check-ups.  My gyno would not prescribe replacement at 48 when I had my surgery_ but the endocrinologist  did when I began to feel like an 80 year old woman.

28, 3, Post menopause,DO NOT TAKE GRAPEFRUIT PRODUCTS WITH ESTROGEN_ A CYP3A4 SUBSTRATE! Levels of estrogen will become too high_ and may cause side effects_ blood clots leading to gangrene_ strokes_ and heart attacks!,The CYP3A4 enzyme clears most of prescribed drugs (substrates) from your system. Check to see if any of your meds or supplements are CYP3A4 substrates and or if they are inhibitors of CYP3A4. Grapefruit stops the action of CYP3A4 gut enzymes completely in 30 minutes_ permanently and irreversibly. You renew the enzyme in over 24 hours_ so taking grapefruit products separately from your drugs does not help. When you can not clear substrates_ levels of them get too high and side effects_ even fatalities_ may occur. Many herbal supplements are CYP3A4 inhibitors as well. Do not take them. Ginkgo_ garlic_ turmeric_ for example. Research every substance for CYP3A4 interactions. Be well!,F,57,  1X D,1/27/2013Email,Vivelle-dot

Nothing else has helped and I've tried everything. I'm just surprised my various doctors never thought to offer the patch to me. I had to ask to try it after reading about it.

Started feeling better on night 2; by night 4 sweats were gone and was able to sleep better. Concentration and mood is much better_ too. Husband notices!!

Finally_ I went to new Dr to get a second opinion on my situation.  Turns out that 10 years ago I should have probably been put on HRT as I didn't have anxiety disorder per se but was in early perimenopause.  My Dr put me on the patch and Progesterone and it has made a night and day difference.  My sleep is much much better and anxiety has been kicked to the curb.  Words cannot express how I wish would have been 1-diagnosed correctly to begin with 2-started these meds years ago as it has made that much of a difference in my quality of life!,F,44,3  weeks0.05 2X W,4/21/2012Email,Vivelle-dot

Hot flashes_ night sweats_ moody_ irritable_ miserable. After nearly 2 years_ find out I cannot absorb this patch. What a waste. Have now been switched to Estradiol pill under the tongue each day.

Nothing major.,I love the Dot_ though I wish it was a weekly dose as opposed to 2x/week which is very awkward and hard to remember. It really stays on until you take it off but I have outlines of glue that I have to remove every 4 days. My skin is dry but that could be because I frequent the beach!

I began suffering with hot flashes and night sweats about 2 years ago and then about 6 months ago_ I started feeling completely 'out-of-sorts' and edgy. I became very moody--extremely sad and/or bitchy at the drop of a hat; I was absolutely miserable and so was my sweetheart_ poor guy.  I feel so much better now--I am much more calm and 'even-keeled' and I feel like I'm in touch with reality again! I no longer have drastic mood swings and my hot flashes and night sweats happen much less often now. I highly recommend Vivelle-Dot to anyone who's suffering with menopausal symptoms!!

Good-bye   drastic mood changes_ uncontrollable crying_ crippling anxiety_  brain fog_ insomnia_ constant daily headache_ agonizing 6-9 day migraines_ blast furnace hot flashes_ dizziness_ hair loss_ and probably a few other things I've blissfully now forgotten. It took me two years of trial and error to arrive at this particular combination of hormone replacement. I tried a variety of estrogen/progestin formulations_ including creams_ gels_ pills_ even Yasmin_ but Vivelle Dot (paired with Prometrium) is by far the best.

I decided that maybe the shocks of my hot flashes may not be any better than replacement therapy so I decided to ask my doctor for the Dot and progesterone cream . I am on the lowest dose and it has helped tremendously. I have only been on for a month so I will update later. So far no weight gain or anything.

60, 5, surgical menopause,none to complain of except Great Goodness...,"After a TAH/BSO_ my doctor gave me a generic Climara patch_ manufactured by Mylan. It reeked. It was Big and Thick and Band-aid colored and the glue did not go all the way to the edge - there was a millimeter or two to spare between 'the rim' and 'where the glue begins' and it collected hideous 'belly-button-lint' at the intersect zone...after I took the patch off_ there was always a big nasty gunky ring what would take rubbing alcohol to remove.  And::: some of those Climara-clone patches wouldn't stick worth a s*** which is Just Disgusting at $8+ per patch_ eh.  The Vivelle-Dot is way smaller_ transparent and thinner_ and sticks like a Tick...the glue goes all the way to the edge.  I have to look for it to see if it's still there_ instead of having it STARE at me (like a Scarlet ""M""_ hunh) like the Other One did. Very pleased!

62, 5, Hysterectomy,None,I love the Vivelle-dot!  I was put on it after a full hysterectomy (for endometriosis/adenomyosis) in 2002.  It's helped my mood_ sex life_ and I don't get the hot flashes and sleep problems that so many of my friends seem to be having.  I started out at 1.1 mg and have slowly tapered down to .5 mg.  I don't plan to be on it indefinitely_ but it (and the hysterectomy) has been a godsend for me.

63, 4, perimenopause,None_ so far so good_ I hope it stays this good.  I had night sweats_ up all night_ I felt like I was going crazy.  The sweating completely stopped on night 2 and I CAN SLEEP!!!,Girls_ you don't have to suffer.  This is the 21st century!!!,F,51,1  weeks,4/15/2007,Vivelle-dot
64, 5, For symptoms of perimenopause,None.,I couldn't function without this drug. Despite my reluctance_ starting hormone replacement was the best medical decision I've made. I regret not starting it sooner. It reversed my word-finding and memory problems_ fatigue_ insomnia_ and subtle personality changes that I thought I was just stuck with. The patch gives continuous release so estrogen levels don't vary_ which can make you feel queasy. It also bypasses the liver_ so it's easier on your body. The adhesive is great; the patch rarely comes off.,F,56,9  years,3/14/2007,Vivelle-dot

66, 5, hysterectomy,No side effects that I am aware of.,Have tried about everything since I was 26 years old and had a hysterectomy.  I feel the best on this.  Highly recommend it over pills.
