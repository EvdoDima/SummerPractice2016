0, 2, chlamydia,Took the 2 gram powder 2 hours after a meal and a little over an hour_ I felt like I was going to die. I violently vomited_ but the doctor told me that most of the medicine was already in my system and not to worry. He told me that feeling this terrible is actually quite common with this antibiotic_ especially with this high dose. I actually had to return to the hospital where I got it because I wasn't sure what was going to happen to me. I'm on day 4 and these are the symptoms I am feeling: Constant upset GI tract_ stomach along with acid reflux_ feeling hot_ mainly in the face_ feeling a little more tired than usual. I'm not experiencing diarrhea_ but each time I pass stool_ it feels like it is going to be diarrhea.,I will never take this medicine ever again. It has been and continues to be an absolute nightmare. I hope my GI tract hasn't been permanently damaged from this medication. If you take this antibiotic_ I suggest eating a lot of probiotics_ but I suggest taking minocycline instead. I took Minocycline once when I was infected with chlamydia on another occasion and it gave me no symptoms and killed of my infection.,M,33,1  days2 grams 1X D,8/15/2016Email,Azithromycin

A raspy Cough has also come up now that I did not have before.,I am very much hoping that these side effects will be gone soon_ as I have stopped my taking of this drug. From what I am reading here_ it may or may Not do so. The Cardiac symptoms are particularly alarming and worrisome.

Also_ the drug removed all of the helpful bacteria from my stomach at the same time it killed the bad bacteria_ leaving my gut unprotected which caused me to have a case of c. difficele which had to be treated with another drug_ metronidazole (brand name Flagyl).  The metronidazole was the worst experience with multiple side effects and then my liver functions tests were found to be elevated.  I had an abdominal ultrasound_ MRI_ endoscopic ultrasound_ and finally liver biopsy.  My liver is sick (intrahepatic ductopenia) and the pathologist and l,I will never take either azithromycin or metronidazole again as I believe another round could kill me.   Incidentially_ both the azithromycin and metronidazole were generic and one has to wonder if that isn't a factor in the quality.  Supposedly generics are the same recipe as the brand name but I know from personal experience that the generic is not always the same as the brand name.  I will never get generic again.  Interestingly_ both the azithromycin and metronidazole that I used where from the same generic manufacturer_ Teva Pharmaceutical.  As a personal opinion_ I will never buy one of their products ever again and will also make sure that any drug I take is manufactured here in the U.S. by a U.S. company.,F,55,5  days500 mg 1X D,4/23/2012Email,Azithromycin

70, 1, Asthematic Bronchitis,HeadacheDizzinessNauseaDiarrheaYeast InfectionUrinary Tract Infection,I will never take his again.  I'm not a big antibiotic taker anyway_ but this chest cold turned into a very serious form of bronchitis in which I needed an antibiotic.  My Doctor said it was MILD and that he had given me the lower dose at 250mg.  I was fine for the duration of actually taking the pill (5 Days) no real side affects except for horrible headaches_ but I was so sick anyway I probably wouldn't have noticed.  After the last day dose (day 5) I started with horrible diarrhea and nausea which lasted another 5 or 6 days. It was awefull.  Then after the diarrhea I started with the WORST yeast infection I have ever had followed by a urinary tract infection.  It was almost like this MILD antibiotic was so STRONG that it removed EVERY bacteria in my body leaving me defenseless.  This scares me about antibiotics and how strong they have become to people who don't just use them for every sniffle.,F,33,5  days250mg 1X D,8/23/2011Email,Azithromycin
71, 5, Prostatitis,Slight Diarhea,I'm taking 3 three pack for prostatitis. 5 weeks_ 3 pills a week.  So far so good.,M,48,7  days500 1X D,8/17/2011,Azithromycin
72, 5, Potential strep throat,Nausea and fatigue the first day (with the double dose)_ lingering nausea and severe diarrhea remaining days. However_ this happens to me with any antibiotics_ and this is one of the few I'm not allergic to.,No energy issues after the first day_ or any mood alterations. I think it's ridiculous to read on here that some people are seeking legal advice because this drug interacts badly for them. My advice: if a drug causes severe side effects for you_ don't take it. Seems pretty simple to me. If you're lactose intolerant are you going to try to sue dairy farmers or get milk taken off the market?  No. That's dumb. Just avoid products that don't work for you. Ask your doctor for a different antibiotic. I'm allergic to several antibiotics. I discovered these by taking them and having adverse reactions. Common sense told me I should not take them again. Pretty cut and dry.  If you're not allergic to the z pack it works just fine and it's nice to have 5 days instead of 10 as you would with other medications.,F,40,5  daysZ pack 1X D,8/3/2011,Azithromycin
