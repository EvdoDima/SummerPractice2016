0, 2, redness and small acne,i am not sure what its doing_ it seems to be bringing everything and I mean everything to the skin surface so I am not sure i like it or not! I will give it 12 weeks and let you all know my results.,,F,37,5  weeks 1X D,2/27/2014Email,Finacea
1, 2, mild acne and rosacea,Itching_ burning,Have to use very little_ and it took skin 2 weeks to adjust.  Very itchy and red and inflamed.  Redness still present and smAll acne bumps still exist_ although I've been using it faithfully.  Must go with generic_ as brand name is ridiculously priced_ even with insurance.  Will probably ask seen for something else once tube is finished.,F,29,1  months 1X D,2/26/2014Email,Finacea
2, 2, Rosacea,Rosacea flareup,Had a bad flareup after applying this to my nose. Since it comes and goes w/o rhyme or reason_ im not sure if Finacea cause it or not_ but im afraid to use it again.,M,54,5  days 1X D,5/6/2013Email,Finacea
3, 3, Acne Treatment,Absolutely no redness.  Peeling just at middle of nostrils and bottom sides of nose.  Not sure Finacea is doing anything.  Using a combo of Panoxyl_ Differin_ and the Finacea.  Face became even more oily.  The Finacea/Differin use seems to be healing new pimples quickly.,Don't see dermatoligist for another three weeks so let's see how my skin is doing by then.,F,49,5  weeks 2X D,3/12/2013Email,Finacea
4, 2, Mild Roseacea,Itching_ redness,Has made the redness on my face worse.  Made my skin dry.  Itching right after application is intense-pt info that came with it said this side effect would go away but it has never subsided completely.,F,39,2  months 1X D,4/27/2012,Finacea
5, 3, mild rosacea,stinging_ burning.,It seems to reduce the redness slightly in the affected area. I don't like the fact that the burning makes it so difficult to apply powder to my cheeks that I need to conceal the redness. This medicine is really a catch 22. I need it to make the skin look better long term_ but using it makes it so that I can't conceal the skin effectively in the interim. I don't think I will continue using it.,F,43,3  months5mg 1X D,2/22/2012Email,Finacea
