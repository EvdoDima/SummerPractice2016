0, 5, Bipolar depression,None,Ketamine infusion worked great on me. The infusion is extremely pleasurable.,M,61,3  weeks? 5X M,6/10/2016Email,Ketamine hydrochloride
1, 4, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD),My initial infusion in ICU was a 7day continual intravenously. I had severe hallucinations_ nausea_ anxiety_ fever_ etc.... Then came in every 3mths for a 2day (4hrs daily) booster. My leg immediately warmed up_ and the pain eased up. Which for anyone with RSD_ any little bit of easing of pain is GLORIOUS!!! Will continue to do ketamine for treating my RSD.,,F,45,1  yearsVaries,7/20/2015Email,Ketamine hydrochloride
