0, 5, Treatment-Resistant MDD,Sleeplessness_ slight jitters early on_ both resolved after 3-4 weeks.  Blood pressure decreased (this was a great plus!),If the impotent SSRI drugs aren't cutting it_ do yourself the biggest favor possible_ and try an MAOI like Parnate.  Find a psychiatrist that has experience with them and therefore knows how straight-forward they are to use.  Practically zero diet changes_ just caution about a couple things. Contact me if you'd like regarding any questions/concerns.  Parnate (Tranylcypromine) has given me my life back.,M,43,4  months10mg 4X D,7/2/2016Email,Parnate
1, 5, Bipolar Depression,Loss of appetite_ irritability_ difficulty sleeping_ weight loss_ anxiety,This drug has saved my life. I have tried everything under the sun_ this is amazing. The side effects suck but are manageable and well worth the outcome. For the first 3 weeks I felt like I was on speed_ but that has subsided now. The diet is annoying and confusing as their seems to be so much different information. I have a home blood pressure machine now so that i can keep an eye on my blood pressure.,F,31,3  months,4/5/2016,Parnate
2, 5, Depression_ anxiety.,I just developed serious stomach issues. I think it's because I'm not rrally following the diet right. I've gotten all types of medical testing done. Blood work_ ultrasound of my liver_ and gallbladder. Endoscopy with biopsies. Catscan from a gastroenterologist. So far the blood work_ ultrasound came out normal. I still get terrible stomach aches when I rat roughage. Salad_ fruit_ etc. I have to stick to this diet right to the t. If I don't take Parnate_ I feel terrible. Yesterday_ I didn't take any_ and I felt soo panicky. I noticed immediately. This morning_ I took my 20mg_ and I'll take my 30mg in the afternoon and 20mg in the evening. For me_ I would rather stop eating these forbidden foods_ than suffer with panic_ and depression. But_ my stomach always hearts when I eat. Hopefully_ I'll get to the bottom of this. No matter what_ I will stay on Parnate. I don't care if I have to live on baby food. My mental health is detrimental to me. I'll keep plugging away until I find out what the hell is wrong with my stomach. In the interim_ I'll stick to this diet.,,F,44,1  times40 mg,3/31/2016Email,Parnate

6, 4, Treatment resistant MDD,First 4 weeks excessive tiredness. So much so that I was unable to work. Still have some afternoons where I am very sleepy but I'm still adjusting doses and the times when I take it and it's much better.  I've found that EXACT timing of the dose can make or break my energy level in the afternoon. The magic combo for me seems to be 20mg. between 9:30 and 10:30am and the other 20mg must be taken between 12 and 1 pm. If I don't take the second dose at that time_ most times I feel like I want to take a nap. As for my depression it is working very well when nothing else did anymore. However_ Parnate is not a quick fix like many of the newer drugs and it took about six weeks to really notice a difference. Now_ I feel 90% better. I almost gave up initially because it seemed so slow to work and I always felt exhausted but I forced myself to hang on because I have been on everything and this was the last class of drugs left for me. I'm glad I did.,,F,42,2  months40,6/14/2015Email,Parnate

It didn't slow my thinking like benzos or alcohol do_ but made me slightly delusional. The worst side effect was emotional instability. Also: cold intolerance_ reduced appetite_ sweating_ insomnia_ headaches_ and dry mouth all of which were present but tolerable if the drug would have been effective.,I took Parnate by itself_ with adderall_ with klonopin and adderall_ and with buspar. In every situation_ I felt good for part of the day and terrible for the other part. This drug might have worked if it weren't for the short term stimulation it causes. Although it didn't work for me_ I think this drug would bring great for people who can handle the short term stimulation it causes.

17, 4, depression,GREAT night's sleep_ UNLESS I take Parnate too late (maybe after about 5:30 p.m.)_ then very poor night's sleep. Strange paradox!,Helps a lot_ but still some periods of deep depression.  Addition of Lithium those times is very effective. I also take Lamictal.  The most striking effect of the Parnate was IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE CESSATION OF severe_ frequent_ lengthy MIGRAINES! Gone with any of the MAO-I's.  Dietary restrictions are not nearly as bad as once thought; old information is not necessarily accurate. Many cheeses_ coffee_ chocolate_ bananas_ etc. are fine.On the other hand_ have Captopril handy in case there is a problem. I avoid a few things such as hard cheeses_ yet over 10 years of MAO-I's my only problems have been with leftover meat.  Be really vigilant about Demerol if you have a medical procedure done_ since many medical staff have no idea about the dangerous interaction.  Ask questions and be assertive.  I have had several close calls.,F,67,5  years40 2X D,12/14/2013,Parnate
18, 3, Depression/Borderline,Fast heartbeat when I first take in the morning. I have a feeling of energy right away. Bad dry mouth. Insomnia at night.,I have suffered from depression and anxiety disorders since I was child. I was also diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder a couple of years ago. I have been hospitalized 20 times for suicide attempts and threatening suicide over the past 18 years. I have been on too many antidepressants to count. I have also had ECT treatments. I tried Nardil_ but didn't like a couple of the side effects. I have only been on parnate for a week_ but so far the major symtom that I notice is Insomnia. One of the first nights I was lucky if I even slept an hour. I do feel energetic  when I first take pill and my heart beats fast. My mood does seem good and I haven't been worrying about things.

I could not tolerate a higher dose. Augmenting it with 400 mg of seroquel got rid of depression plus I sleep great. Only gained 5 lbs from seroquel. Did not gain or lose weight with parnate.

21, 5, Depression/Anxiety,Insomnia_ dizziness and irregular heartbeat (from blood pressure effects; went away after a few weeks)_ dry mouth_ constipation_ hair loss on legs,Parnate has worked better than anything I've taken in the past 10 years at giving me some emotion back.  Early on I actually gained some feeling back_ feelings I hadn't had since I was a kid.  But as I've continued taking it these feelings have started to wane.  With a half-life of around 2.5 hours_ I'm thinking I might see if my pdoc will push my dose to 30 mg twice a day.  I'm currently on lamictal also_ but I can't tell if it's augmenting the parnate or not.  If I could experience those initial feelings again on a regular basis_ I'd welcome all the side effects I've experienced so far.,M,33,60  days20 2X D,9/30/2013Email,Parnate
22, 4, Atypical depression treatment res.,Insomnia (2 hours sleep a night typical)Aggression (hey_ it is an amphetamine after all)Soy sauce and vintage cheese sensitivity,The only drug to actually help with my persistant suicidal ideation. Was told ECT was the only option until an elderly psychiatrist tried it. Unlike most antidepressants I've been on it's activating - no sedation at all. This isn't good though - in Australia benzodiazepines are frowned upon_ so as a result I drink - a lot - to actually sleep. If you do try to push through it (such as I am now - 40 hours straight without sleep) please don't drive - your judgement is impaired similar to a truck driver taking methamphetamine.Dietary restrictions have been pleasantly minor. I can eat as many preserved meats as I like. Cloudy beer only raises my BP slightly. The major problems have been soy sauce and aged cheese. Colby cheese is fine and I eat the stuff by the block now. Brandy raises my BP significantly so I can only have one serve now.Aggression has never been in my personality_ but happens on Parnate. I normally back down when yelled at_ but become strongly defensive on Parnate. My wife recently compared me to her former partners and I effectively told her if she wasn't so promiscuous_ how the fudge would she know? I don't become violent towards other people_ but I did throw the 50KG BBQ about ten metres effortlessly.,M,32,1  years20mg 1X D,9/13/2013Email,Parnate
23, 1, Atypical Depression,I'm one of the very unlucky users of Parnate that had hypertension symptoms for no reason.  Every dose would send my BP to 155-160 over 90-95.  My pulse would slow to almost 55 bmp.  I would become flushed and have very shallow breathing.  After only a few days of use_ I stopped taking Parnate.,Moving onto Nardil. Parnate my very well work for others so do not let my reactions and experience discourage you from trying this.  We are all different.  What doesn't work for me_ may work for you.  Pay close attention to how you feel after taking Parnate.  Do yourself a favor (when taking ANY MAOI) and spend $50 and get yourself a blood pressure monitor.

25, 5, Unipolar depression,Severe hair loss - it's coming out by the handful every time I wash it; for the first month_ severe tiredness every day around 4-5 p.m. - this went away,Parnate saved my life.  Like so many others_ I have been on every single drug_ and frustrated - my last psychiatrist said the only option left was ECT.  This is so crazy to me now!  I have a fantastic doctor who prescribed Parnate --- and I have ADD_ so I also take Adderall.  I have had no problems whatsoever with any interaction.  When she prescribed Parnate_ I was at my lowest mood ever - suicidal thoughts and overwhelming depression.  The Parnate lifted my mood like no other anti-depressant ever has.  Yes_ I'll never be able to eat sushi or at a Japanese restaurant again_ which is a bummer.  But it gave me a life back_ when I had given up completely.  I feel angry that nobody ever suggested MAOIs before!  I have been seen by psychiatrists since I was a teenager for major depressive disorder_ and I have been on various antidepressants since I was 18 years old_ and Parnate is a godsend!,F,40,6  months80 mg 1X D,7/24/2013,Parnate

I feel like this drug is in a whole different category as far as horsepower to get rid of the anxiety.

27, 5, Atypical depression_ panic disorder,Afternoon fatigue during the first couple of weeks which has dissappeared. A small amount of dry mouth_ easy to deal with.,This medication has been an absolute life saver. I have tried almost every medication inthe psychotropic arsenal_ several doctors_ and Parnate has relieved nearly every symptom that I have suffered from for the last 22 years. The grass is green_ the sky blue_ I wake up early every morning_ motivated_ hobbies are fun again_ appetite control (have lost 16 lbs in the 5 weeks I have been taking it)_ I can concentrate on work and tasks_ and I could go on. I have used EMSAM and Nardil also_ but for me Parnate is far superior to both. EMSAM too stimulating and caused easy agitation and Nardil made me want to sleep all the time with rediculous weight gain. Parnate has my highest recommendation (generic or brand_ I've had both with no difference).,M,40,5  weeks10mg 2X D,7/9/2013Email,Parnate

29, 5, subcycling unipolar disorder,13 yrs total now down to 20 mg. My posting before must have been too long as it didn't save. I had another tyramine  reaction... middle eastern food. Someone else ordered and I never thought of what marinated meant. 10 minutes after the meal I had a head ache like never before and my blood pressure was way out there. It meant a trip to the emergency room. The triage people were not very nice...but once I got the med to bring my blood pressure down I recovered quickly. Hair loss continues but not as much now at 20? or it is my age.,To the person wanting encouragement... keep on. It may take awhile. It might help to keep a journal so you can go back and read it later and find that you are improving. Be reasonable with the diet. New guidelines are not as strict as the old ones. A tiny tiny bit of something you like as a  treat might work. Or if it is something you don't like_ use your diet as an excuse to not have it!

Dr. at hospital recommended this ""old"" drug Parnate; said its benefits might outweigh its side-effects/restrictions.   I don't miss cheese or coldcuts; I do miss salted fish and soya sauce.  But not enough to give up Parnate.  For the first time in years_ I feel like a normal person.   I didn't even know how depressed I was until it went away.   I can't believe what a difference this has made to my life.   I already had hereditary hypertension_ but was already on meds for it and have not had to adjust them any.  I was already on Imovane for sleeping so am not experiencing any insomnia that some have reported.  It took about a month before I really felt well; so don't give up after just a week or two.

Then I DISCOVERED THAT CINNAMIN WASHS OUT PARNATE.  Only Dr Bob memtions this important fact.  SinceI stopped eating cinnamin Parnate is effective daily.  I do not eat chesse_ soy or aged meants.

33, 5, subcycling unipolar disorder,I find Parnate very activating. Hair loss has been significant (this time.) I am glad to read others have had the same thing. To help the insomnia_ my doctor and I worked out a plan to take most of the 30 mg early in the day. I take 20 in the morning and the other 10 about 2 pm.  I still sleep less than before_ but that is ok.,I tried everything. Most things helped a little. Even lithium. The lithium took care of the depression but I got so shaky it was not good. I took another medication that was making me bald which is not ok with me. I took Parnate for about 8 years the first time_ very very slowly decreasing the dose and still doing great. After about 5 years I recognized the depression was coming back. I went back to the doctor_ we started on the 30 mg and in about 1 month I felt much better.

35, 4, Anxiety/depression,Other than feeling chilled all the time_ fatigue was a constant issue. Parnate worked well for my panic disorder. I had been on parnate for three years when out of nowhere the worst headaches came on suddenly( no relation to parnate) neurologists believe I had a bout w/ cluster headaches. They lasted 22 days and since I was on parnate_ they couldn't treat them. The doctors were blocked because of all the drug interactions. Needless to say I was in and out of the hospital to be on iv w/ dialoded for 22 days to cover the pain. If these intact were clusters_ I couldn't stay on an MAOI. This was an easy decision to make since the headaches felt just as painful as giving birth. I did a quick 2 1/2 wk ween off and have been parnate free for 1 week now. Yes_ the anxiety is back. So parnate did do it's job. But I'll take panic( although aweful) over clusters anyday.,,F,33,3  years40 mg,1/27/2012,Parnate
36, 5, Treatment Resistant Depression,Acute blood pressure spikes when starting first initial dosing_ which disappeared after a couple days.

Tried everything from SSRI/SSNI/TCA's_ mood stabilizers_ anti-psychotics to stimulants and even NDMA antagonists.. Name it_ I've tried it. The first 4 weeks I felt clear_ motivated_ and best of all NORMAL. Fatigue has been my biggest complaint_ but on some days I am side-effect free. Memory recall is bothersome to some degree_ but memory seems to be improving over time. The first 4 weeks were interrupted by bereavement_ which I am still dealing with now.

Before this I was constantly tired (body and mind)_ had poor cognitive function_ and going to the grocery store took every ounce of energy I could muster. My depression was obviously resistant to treatment so why an MAOI wasn't suggested earlier is beyond me. All drugs have drawbacks_ so avoiding a very small selection of foods is a small price to pay in exchange for overall mental health. I have had no issues with interactions even having eaten many of the off limits foods in small amounts (not that I'm testing it).

Soy sauce is a major culprit_ as is sauerkraut.,I'm 60 yrs. old and before taking Parnate I could never deal with the depression or the side effects of other medication.

46, 1, Major Depression,Major increase in blood pressure at all times; had to go on a beta blocker just to be able to continue taking the med. Insomnia. Major anxiety upon discontinuation (which had only been a minor issue previously).,I realize parnate has been a life-saver for a lot of people_ but it was a horrible drug for me! My blood pressure immediately rose to dangerous levels up initiation of treatment_ so my dr. put me on a beta blocker just to stabilize my bp enough to continue taking the drug. After 6 weeks at 40mg/day with NO improvement in my depression_ I abruptly stopped taking it. No withdrawel symptoms per se_ but my blood pressure_ which had been normal prior to taking parnate_ has remained elevated 2 months after discontinuation and my anxiety levels have skyrocketed. I had minor anxiety prior to taking parnate_ but never like I've had since stopping treatment. It seems to have permanently changed my body/brain chemistry. Example -- I tried to resume taking wellbutrin after stopping parnate (after a 2 week washout) and while the wellbutrin did help improve my mood as it had done in the past_ my anxiety was so increased that I could no longer take wellbutrin_ leaving me in a bad situation. I am now trying various serotonin-type drugs to help quell my anxiety so I can resume treatment with wellbutrin at some point (that's the only drug that's helped me much over the years_ but had pooped out on me)_ but so far _ not having any luck. MAOI's are generally known for decreasing a patient's blood pressure_ but be aware that for a few people_ it can majorly increase your blood pressure and that effect may not go away even after ceasing treatment...be careful!,F,44,6  weeks10mg 4X D,2/20/2011,Parnate

Then on Parnate it happened not as bad. Figured out black licorice was the problem. It's one of ther bad foods. I can tolerate most other foods in moderation and not at the same time except red wine even something cooked with red wine. I have a restricted diet anyway from having gastric bypass surgery 7yrs ago so I'm not sure that some of my symptoms are related to that.

I suffered severe depression for over 30 years before I finally found this drug after doing my own research in one of my darkest hours. I had been in the wrong group of drugs my entire life.  I sincerely wish a doctor would have figured that out sooner.  Parnate was effective for me within a few days.  The world was just lighter.  I finally realized how ""normal"" people feel.  Parnate should not be a drug of last resort.  I lost years of my life without knowing about it and the medical community did not mention it.",F,56,2  years10 mg 6X D,11/16/2010Email,Parnate
50, 2, Major depression,In the first 1-2 weeks_ extreme fatigue (not so much tiredness) in the afternoons. I could barely keep my eyes open. I also had trouble falling asleep initially_ although did not feel tired in the mornings. An odd side effect was feeling very cold_ particularly at night time_ when others reported the room temperature was fine. Overall_ there were none of the horrible side effects associated with tricyclics or SSRIs.,I've tried SSRIs_ SNRIs_ tricyclics and others_ with limited success. After reading the positive comments on here_ I thought Parnate would prove to be a success for me. However_ after 3.5 weeks_ I can't say I feel any better_ and in fact feel that I'm deteriorating. I've ordered Stablon from an overseas pharmacy and hope that proves to more helpful.,M,34,3.5  weeks30mg 1X D,11/4/2010,Parnate

Extreme water retention ~ 10 lbs gained in 1 week.,After trying many other types/combinations of anti-depressants and ECT over the past 19 yrs_ I have never felt worse than I have since switching to Parnate.

With time_ that went away.","I'd been through every medication available and 9 electric shock therapies in a 3 week time frame.  Nothing was helping.  I was cycling down further each time and staying there longer.  Parnate keeps me from cycling and has me on an even keel unless I'm experiencing a lot of stress in my life.  I'm not ""happy""_ but I'm able to function and interact.  When I couldn't go to sleep or stay asleep the doctor put me on Neurontin 400 mg and it helps most of the time.  I break the Parnate dosage into 2 parts_ one at 8 am and one at lunch.  I take the larger dose in the morning.",F,51,15  years70 mg 1X D,8/27/2010Email,Parnate

I'm 38. I was on the EMSAM (MAOI) patch and it was the first thing that ever worked for me (20 years of my life wasted on trial after long trial of the ""new!"" antidepressants) and it felt like a miracle but it only lasted a year. I was at max dose and augmentation strategies (ritalin_ adderal_ provigil_ abilify_ seroquel_ xanax) did not help. I've only been taking Parnate for a week but on day 3 it was like BOOM!- life changed again. I hope it lasts!!! I feel like a person again instead of an immobile hermit!  Doc was hesitant about trying MAOI- I told HIM about the patch. He was afraid I'd intentionally kill myself by eating the wrong stuff.

My nurse & doc said it was the ""nuclear weapon"" against depression - very effective_ but one of the last resorts.  You MUST pay attention to the warnings and avoid alcohol_ certain other meds & anesthetics_ & certain foods.  After the first course of 30mg/day_ I found I could use 10 mg/day for less side effect danger_ but it still gives me the boost I need.  It is expensive even in generic (less with a drug discount card) but well worth it.

57, 5, Anxiety and panic attacks,If taken after 3.00pm insomnia can develop.Sensitivity to light(only sometimes) and dry  mouth are the three main symptoms that have effected me over the years.,I have been on this medication for some time. I have stopped it twice during two pregnancy of which I survived without any problems. After the birth of my first child I  developed post natal depression and the doctor put me on nardil. This helped me a great deal. Then when I was pregnant the second time I stopped taking the medication but as soon as the baby was born I knew the symptoms of depression and I went straight to my doctor who started me on Nardil so I did not suffer the symptoms of depression for long. Then Nardil was taken off the market and my doctor then prescribed Parnate for me which is from the same family as Nardil. Without this medication I would not have been able to survive the normal things that you do from day to day. I have been able to rare a family and work at the same time and if taking a tablet everyday means getting you out of bed and putting a smile on your face then its worth the while.,M,49,27  years10mg 2X D,4/9/2010Email,Parnate
58, 5, ptsd; refractory depression,Orthostatic hypotension_ insomnia and fatigue_ 24/7 jaw clenching_ dilated pupils and blurred vision_ low appetite_ anorgasmia_ choreoathetoid movements (worse at night)_ urinary hesitancy,I wouldn't be putting up with all these side-effects if my response hadn't been so profound. It wasn't mania; it was a recovery of myself; it was happiness and it was pure and normal. But it pooped out. I'm still playing around with increasing the dose and/or augmenting it with different things.  Dexedrine in small doses has helped with the hypotension.  So does spacing out the Parnate.The choreoathetosis is apparently unusual.A lot of people report a stimulant-like effect from Parnate.  I don't experience this feeling at all_ apart from the magical absense of leaden paralysis and psychomotor slowing.,F,22,1  years100mg 1X D,4/3/2010Email,Parnate
59, 3, Depression,Cold Sensitivity_ High Blood Pressure (non-diet related)_ slight weight loss (good thing)_ afternoon fatigue (went away),Started taking Parnate in December at 10mg.  Taped up 10mg about every 2 to 3 weeks until I reached 60mg.  It helped with depression but didn't necessarily make things more enjoyable.  I felt more focused about getting things done when I had things to do.  It also seemed to really help with self-confidence in social situations.  However at the same time I felt a little empty in the feeling department (not enough serotonin?).  I'd still be on it but I noticed (accidentally really) that an hour or two after each dose my blood pressure was going extremely high (like 170/100).  The only reason I caught this was because I was at a CVS waiting for a script and used their machine out of bordom - it was extemely high. Freaked me out so I bought a BP monitor and sure enough every morning my BP was around 115/75 which is normal but after taking my first dose of Parnate (2x10mg) it would shoot up to at least 160/90.  This wasn't diet related as I checked it for 4 days and made sure I wasn't taking anything even remotely risky for MAOI takers.  Due to that unfortunate side effect my pdoc and I decided to take me off Parnate and we're going to give Marplan a try.  Hopefully that'll work as well as Parnate and w/o the weight gain Nardil is supposed to cause.  I'll post my experience w/ Marplan in a few months.  My pDoc was adamant that my other meds didn't contribute to the BP problem but to be fair I was also taking: Lamictal (200mg)_ Lithium (600mg)_ and Seroquel (100mg).,M,32,3  months20mg 3X D,3/19/2010,Parnate
