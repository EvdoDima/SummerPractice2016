0, 5, Treatment-Resistant MDD,Sleeplessness_ slight jitters early on_ both resolved after 3-4 weeks.  Blood pressure decreased (this was a great plus!),If the impotent SSRI drugs aren't cutting it_ do yourself the biggest favor possible_ and try an MAOI like Parnate.  Find a psychiatrist that has experience with them and therefore knows how straight-forward they are to use.  Practically zero diet changes_ just caution about a couple things. Contact me if you'd like regarding any questions/concerns.  Parnate (Tranylcypromine) has given me my life back.,M,43,4  months10mg 4X D,7/2/2016Email,Parnate
1, 5, Bipolar Depression,Loss of appetite_ irritability_ difficulty sleeping_ weight loss_ anxiety,This drug has saved my life. I have tried everything under the sun_ this is amazing. The side effects suck but are manageable and well worth the outcome. For the first 3 weeks I felt like I was on speed_ but that has subsided now. The diet is annoying and confusing as their seems to be so much different information. I have a home blood pressure machine now so that i can keep an eye on my blood pressure.,F,31,3  months,4/5/2016,Parnate
2, 5, Depression_ anxiety.,I just developed serious stomach issues. I think it's because I'm not rrally following the diet right. I've gotten all types of medical testing done. Blood work_ ultrasound of my liver_ and gallbladder. Endoscopy with biopsies. Catscan from a gastroenterologist. So far the blood work_ ultrasound came out normal. I still get terrible stomach aches when I rat roughage. Salad_ fruit_ etc. I have to stick to this diet right to the t. If I don't take Parnate_ I feel terrible. Yesterday_ I didn't take any_ and I felt soo panicky. I noticed immediately. This morning_ I took my 20mg_ and I'll take my 30mg in the afternoon and 20mg in the evening. For me_ I would rather stop eating these forbidden foods_ than suffer with panic_ and depression. But_ my stomach always hearts when I eat. Hopefully_ I'll get to the bottom of this. No matter what_ I will stay on Parnate. I don't care if I have to live on baby food. My mental health is detrimental to me. I'll keep plugging away until I find out what the hell is wrong with my stomach. In the interim_ I'll stick to this diet.,,F,44,1  times40 mg,3/31/2016Email,Parnate

6, 4, Treatment resistant MDD,First 4 weeks excessive tiredness. So much so that I was unable to work. Still have some afternoons where I am very sleepy but I'm still adjusting doses and the times when I take it and it's much better.  I've found that EXACT timing of the dose can make or break my energy level in the afternoon. The magic combo for me seems to be 20mg. between 9:30 and 10:30am and the other 20mg must be taken between 12 and 1 pm. If I don't take the second dose at that time_ most times I feel like I want to take a nap. As for my depression it is working very well when nothing else did anymore. However_ Parnate is not a quick fix like many of the newer drugs and it took about six weeks to really notice a difference. Now_ I feel 90% better. I almost gave up initially because it seemed so slow to work and I always felt exhausted but I forced myself to hang on because I have been on everything and this was the last class of drugs left for me. I'm glad I did.,,F,42,2  months40,6/14/2015Email,Parnate

It didn't slow my thinking like benzos or alcohol do_ but made me slightly delusional. The worst side effect was emotional instability. Also: cold intolerance_ reduced appetite_ sweating_ insomnia_ headaches_ and dry mouth all of which were present but tolerable if the drug would have been effective.,I took Parnate by itself_ with adderall_ with klonopin and adderall_ and with buspar. In every situation_ I felt good for part of the day and terrible for the other part. This drug might have worked if it weren't for the short term stimulation it causes. Although it didn't work for me_ I think this drug would bring great for people who can handle the short term stimulation it causes.

17, 4, depression,GREAT night's sleep_ UNLESS I take Parnate too late (maybe after about 5:30 p.m.)_ then very poor night's sleep. Strange paradox!,Helps a lot_ but still some periods of deep depression.  Addition of Lithium those times is very effective. I also take Lamictal.  The most striking effect of the Parnate was IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE CESSATION OF severe_ frequent_ lengthy MIGRAINES! Gone with any of the MAO-I's.  Dietary restrictions are not nearly as bad as once thought; old information is not necessarily accurate. Many cheeses_ coffee_ chocolate_ bananas_ etc. are fine.On the other hand_ have Captopril handy in case there is a problem. I avoid a few things such as hard cheeses_ yet over 10 years of MAO-I's my only problems have been with leftover meat.  Be really vigilant about Demerol if you have a medical procedure done_ since many medical staff have no idea about the dangerous interaction.  Ask questions and be assertive.  I have had several close calls.,F,67,5  years40 2X D,12/14/2013,Parnate
18, 3, Depression/Borderline,Fast heartbeat when I first take in the morning. I have a feeling of energy right away. Bad dry mouth. Insomnia at night.,I have suffered from depression and anxiety disorders since I was child. I was also diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder a couple of years ago. I have been hospitalized 20 times for suicide attempts and threatening suicide over the past 18 years. I have been on too many antidepressants to count. I have also had ECT treatments. I tried Nardil_ but didn't like a couple of the side effects. I have only been on parnate for a week_ but so far the major symtom that I notice is Insomnia. One of the first nights I was lucky if I even slept an hour. I do feel energetic  when I first take pill and my heart beats fast. My mood does seem good and I haven't been worrying about things.

I could not tolerate a higher dose. Augmenting it with 400 mg of seroquel got rid of depression plus I sleep great. Only gained 5 lbs from seroquel. Did not gain or lose weight with parnate.

21, 5, Depression/Anxiety,Insomnia_ dizziness and irregular heartbeat (from blood pressure effects; went away after a few weeks)_ dry mouth_ constipation_ hair loss on legs,Parnate has worked better than anything I've taken in the past 10 years at giving me some emotion back.  Early on I actually gained some feeling back_ feelings I hadn't had since I was a kid.  But as I've continued taking it these feelings have started to wane.  With a half-life of around 2.5 hours_ I'm thinking I might see if my pdoc will push my dose to 30 mg twice a day.  I'm currently on lamictal also_ but I can't tell if it's augmenting the parnate or not.  If I could experience those initial feelings again on a regular basis_ I'd welcome all the side effects I've experienced so far.,M,33,60  days20 2X D,9/30/2013Email,Parnate
22, 4, Atypical depression treatment res.,Insomnia (2 hours sleep a night typical)Aggression (hey_ it is an amphetamine after all)Soy sauce and vintage cheese sensitivity,The only drug to actually help with my persistant suicidal ideation. Was told ECT was the only option until an elderly psychiatrist tried it. Unlike most antidepressants I've been on it's activating - no sedation at all. This isn't good though - in Australia benzodiazepines are frowned upon_ so as a result I drink - a lot - to actually sleep. If you do try to push through it (such as I am now - 40 hours straight without sleep) please don't drive - your judgement is impaired similar to a truck driver taking methamphetamine.Dietary restrictions have been pleasantly minor. I can eat as many preserved meats as I like. Cloudy beer only raises my BP slightly. The major problems have been soy sauce and aged cheese. Colby cheese is fine and I eat the stuff by the block now. Brandy raises my BP significantly so I can only have one serve now.Aggression has never been in my personality_ but happens on Parnate. I normally back down when yelled at_ but become strongly defensive on Parnate. My wife recently compared me to her former partners and I effectively told her if she wasn't so promiscuous_ how the fudge would she know? I don't become violent towards other people_ but I did throw the 50KG BBQ about ten metres effortlessly.,M,32,1  years20mg 1X D,9/13/2013Email,Parnate
23, 1, Atypical Depression,I'm one of the very unlucky users of Parnate that had hypertension symptoms for no reason.  Every dose would send my BP to 155-160 over 90-95.  My pulse would slow to almost 55 bmp.  I would become flushed and have very shallow breathing.  After only a few days of use_ I stopped taking Parnate.,Moving onto Nardil. Parnate my very well work for others so do not let my reactions and experience discourage you from trying this.  We are all different.  What doesn't work for me_ may work for you.  Pay close attention to how you feel after taking Parnate.  Do yourself a favor (when taking ANY MAOI) and spend $50 and get yourself a blood pressure monitor.

25, 5, Unipolar depression,Severe hair loss - it's coming out by the handful every time I wash it; for the first month_ severe tiredness every day around 4-5 p.m. - this went away,Parnate saved my life.  Like so many others_ I have been on every single drug_ and frustrated - my last psychiatrist said the only option left was ECT.  This is so crazy to me now!  I have a fantastic doctor who prescribed Parnate --- and I have ADD_ so I also take Adderall.  I have had no problems whatsoever with any interaction.  When she prescribed Parnate_ I was at my lowest mood ever - suicidal thoughts and overwhelming depression.  The Parnate lifted my mood like no other anti-depressant ever has.  Yes_ I'll never be able to eat sushi or at a Japanese restaurant again_ which is a bummer.  But it gave me a life back_ when I had given up completely.  I feel angry that nobody ever suggested MAOIs before!  I have been seen by psychiatrists since I was a teenager for major depressive disorder_ and I have been on various antidepressants since I was 18 years old_ and Parnate is a godsend!,F,40,6  months80 mg 1X D,7/24/2013,Parnate

I feel like this drug is in a whole different category as far as horsepower to get rid of the anxiety.

27, 5, Atypical depression_ panic disorder,Afternoon fatigue during the first couple of weeks which has dissappeared. A small amount of dry mouth_ easy to deal with.,This medication has been an absolute life saver. I have tried almost every medication inthe psychotropic arsenal_ several doctors_ and Parnate has relieved nearly every symptom that I have suffered from for the last 22 years. The grass is green_ the sky blue_ I wake up early every morning_ motivated_ hobbies are fun again_ appetite control (have lost 16 lbs in the 5 weeks I have been taking it)_ I can concentrate on work and tasks_ and I could go on. I have used EMSAM and Nardil also_ but for me Parnate is far superior to both. EMSAM too stimulating and caused easy agitation and Nardil made me want to sleep all the time with rediculous weight gain. Parnate has my highest recommendation (generic or brand_ I've had both with no difference).,M,40,5  weeks10mg 2X D,7/9/2013Email,Parnate

29, 5, subcycling unipolar disorder,13 yrs total now down to 20 mg. My posting before must have been too long as it didn't save. I had another tyramine  reaction... middle eastern food. Someone else ordered and I never thought of what marinated meant. 10 minutes after the meal I had a head ache like never before and my blood pressure was way out there. It meant a trip to the emergency room. The triage people were not very nice...but once I got the med to bring my blood pressure down I recovered quickly. Hair loss continues but not as much now at 20? or it is my age.,To the person wanting encouragement... keep on. It may take awhile. It might help to keep a journal so you can go back and read it later and find that you are improving. Be reasonable with the diet. New guidelines are not as strict as the old ones. A tiny tiny bit of something you like as a  treat might work. Or if it is something you don't like_ use your diet as an excuse to not have it!

Dr. at hospital recommended this ""old"" drug Parnate; said its benefits might outweigh its side-effects/restrictions.   I don't miss cheese or coldcuts; I do miss salted fish and soya sauce.  But not enough to give up Parnate.  For the first time in years_ I feel like a normal person.   I didn't even know how depressed I was until it went away.   I can't believe what a difference this has made to my life.   I already had hereditary hypertension_ but was already on meds for it and have not had to adjust them any.  I was already on Imovane for sleeping so am not experiencing any insomnia that some have reported.  It took about a month before I really felt well; so don't give up after just a week or two.

Then I DISCOVERED THAT CINNAMIN WASHS OUT PARNATE.  Only Dr Bob memtions this important fact.  SinceI stopped eating cinnamin Parnate is effective daily.  I do not eat chesse_ soy or aged meants.

33, 5, subcycling unipolar disorder,I find Parnate very activating. Hair loss has been significant (this time.) I am glad to read others have had the same thing. To help the insomnia_ my doctor and I worked out a plan to take most of the 30 mg early in the day. I take 20 in the morning and the other 10 about 2 pm.  I still sleep less than before_ but that is ok.,I tried everything. Most things helped a little. Even lithium. The lithium took care of the depression but I got so shaky it was not good. I took another medication that was making me bald which is not ok with me. I took Parnate for about 8 years the first time_ very very slowly decreasing the dose and still doing great. After about 5 years I recognized the depression was coming back. I went back to the doctor_ we started on the 30 mg and in about 1 month I felt much better.

35, 4, Anxiety/depression,Other than feeling chilled all the time_ fatigue was a constant issue. Parnate worked well for my panic disorder. I had been on parnate for three years when out of nowhere the worst headaches came on suddenly( no relation to parnate) neurologists believe I had a bout w/ cluster headaches. They lasted 22 days and since I was on parnate_ they couldn't treat them. The doctors were blocked because of all the drug interactions. Needless to say I was in and out of the hospital to be on iv w/ dialoded for 22 days to cover the pain. If these intact were clusters_ I couldn't stay on an MAOI. This was an easy decision to make since the headaches felt just as painful as giving birth. I did a quick 2 1/2 wk ween off and have been parnate free for 1 week now. Yes_ the anxiety is back. So parnate did do it's job. But I'll take panic( although aweful) over clusters anyday.,,F,33,3  years40 mg,1/27/2012,Parnate
36, 5, Treatment Resistant Depression,Acute blood pressure spikes when starting first initial dosing_ which disappeared after a couple days.

Tried everything from SSRI/SSNI/TCA's_ mood stabilizers_ anti-psychotics to stimulants and even NDMA antagonists.. Name it_ I've tried it. The first 4 weeks I felt clear_ motivated_ and best of all NORMAL. Fatigue has been my biggest complaint_ but on some days I am side-effect free. Memory recall is bothersome to some degree_ but memory seems to be improving over time. The first 4 weeks were interrupted by bereavement_ which I am still dealing with now.

Before this I was constantly tired (body and mind)_ had poor cognitive function_ and going to the grocery store took every ounce of energy I could muster. My depression was obviously resistant to treatment so why an MAOI wasn't suggested earlier is beyond me. All drugs have drawbacks_ so avoiding a very small selection of foods is a small price to pay in exchange for overall mental health. I have had no issues with interactions even having eaten many of the off limits foods in small amounts (not that I'm testing it).

46, 1, Major Depression,Major increase in blood pressure at all times; had to go on a beta blocker just to be able to continue taking the med. Insomnia. Major anxiety upon discontinuation (which had only been a minor issue previously).,I realize parnate has been a life-saver for a lot of people_ but it was a horrible drug for me! My blood pressure immediately rose to dangerous levels up initiation of treatment_ so my dr. put me on a beta blocker just to stabilize my bp enough to continue taking the drug. After 6 weeks at 40mg/day with NO improvement in my depression_ I abruptly stopped taking it. No withdrawel symptoms per se_ but my blood pressure_ which had been normal prior to taking parnate_ has remained elevated 2 months after discontinuation and my anxiety levels have skyrocketed. I had minor anxiety prior to taking parnate_ but never like I've had since stopping treatment. It seems to have permanently changed my body/brain chemistry. Example -- I tried to resume taking wellbutrin after stopping parnate (after a 2 week washout) and while the wellbutrin did help improve my mood as it had done in the past_ my anxiety was so increased that I could no longer take wellbutrin_ leaving me in a bad situation. I am now trying various serotonin-type drugs to help quell my anxiety so I can resume treatment with wellbutrin at some point (that's the only drug that's helped me much over the years_ but had pooped out on me)_ but so far _ not having any luck.

This helped me a great deal. Then when I was pregnant the second time I stopped taking the medication but as soon as the baby was born I knew the symptoms of depression and I went straight to my doctor who started me on Nardil so I did not suffer the symptoms of depression for long. Then Nardil was taken off the market and my doctor then prescribed Parnate for me which is from the same family as Nardil. Without this medication I would not have been able to survive the normal things that you do from day to day.

Taped up 10mg about every 2 to 3 weeks until I reached 60mg.  It helped with depression but didn't necessarily make things more enjoyable.  I felt more focused about getting things done when I had things to do.  It also seemed to really help with self-confidence in social situations.  However at the same time I felt a little empty in the feeling department (not enough serotonin?).  I'd still be on it but I noticed (accidentally really) that an hour or two after each dose my blood pressure was going extremely high (like 170/100).  The only reason I caught this was because I was at a CVS waiting for a script and used their machine out of bordom - it was extemely high. Freaked me out so I bought a BP monitor and sure enough every morning my BP was around 115/75 which is normal but after taking my first dose of Parnate (2x10mg) it would shoot up to at least 160/90.  This wasn't diet related as I checked it for 4 days and made sure I wasn't taking anything even remotely risky for MAOI takers.  Due to that unfortunate side effect my pdoc and I decided to take me off Parnate and we're going to give Marplan a try.  Hopefully that'll work as well as Parnate and w/o the weight gain Nardil is supposed to cause.  I'll post my experience w/ Marplan in a few months.  My pDoc was adamant that my other meds didn't contribute to the BP problem but to be fair I was also taking: Lamictal (200mg)_ Lithium (600mg)_ and Seroquel (100mg).,M,32,3  months20mg 3X D,3/19/2010,Parnate

Also_ sometimes I get anxiety if I take the tablets (im on 40mg) too close together_ or without food.  But all of these pale in comparison to the depression I had!!  Dry mouth sometimes.,"This drug quite literally saved my life.  I had been on 13 different antidepressants_ in various combinations_ for three years.  None of them worked_ hence my diagnosis of severe atypical treatment resistant depression (whew_ what a title!).  The ""atypical"" bit came about because i put on weight (lots of it) rather than lost it_ my depression was MUCH worse at night rather than during the day_ and I wasnt particularly melancholic.  As a last resort I researched drugs myself and read about parnate.  THe Dr initially refused to put me on it_ but relented after significant pressure from me.  Within one week most of my ""depression"" had gone (though the aftereffects of living with depression for 3 years without remission took a lot longer to overcome)_ and I was back to normal.  I was initially on 20mgs (the max dose in new zealand where i live)_ and it stopped working after about 3 months.  THe dr put me up to 40_ and i was fine for 3 years.  Then dr asked me to go down",F,30,5  years,6/9/2008,Parnate
85, 5, Treatment resistant depression,This drug has had the longest efficacy (2+ years) of anything I've taken.  The dietary restrictions are really not so bad--so long as you eat most of your meals at home.  Restaurants tend to put cheese in everything!  I've had some problems with insomnia and urinary retention_ but the relief from depression is worth almost any side-effect.,"A couple of points:(1) One very interesting strategy that my doctor has suggested_ which has worked four times when Parnate started to ""poop out"".  At his suggestion_ I have tapered off very rapidly (3-4 days) gone without the drug for a week_ and quickly tapered up to the old dose (60 mg/day.  I have never heard of this idea before_ but it has worked extremely well for me.  (Noting that everyone is different_ and one should do this only under MD direction.)(2) At age 63_ I wonder if I should be increasing the dose.  I've read that dopamine falls off rapidly with age_ and I think that in my case the dopamine increase may be a major feature of the drug. I will consult my MD on this.",M,63,2  years,5/23/2008,Parnate

I'm going up to 40mg_ hoping this will help because SSRI's are pretty useless for me. For the week that I did feel better it was a big improvement... so maybe a higher does will do the trick.",F,30,25  days,5/1/2008,Parnate
87, 5, Panic Attacks_ Anxiety_ Depression,I have been taking it for so long I cannot remember but it was the only medicine I took that did not have nasty or long lasting side affects like other medicines. Of course the only thing you have to watch is certain foods_ OTC products and if you have surgery.  You will be able to determine what you can or cannot eat over time. I would recommend getting a Blood Pressure kit just to be safe.,"The only medicine that worked for my symptoms quickly(within a few weeks)and I tried alot of different meds before Parnate. After 25 years of taking this medicine I just had my first panic attack  My new doctor said that my body is now just metabolizing the medicine in my body faster and I have to increase my dosage from 5 tabs to 6 tabs and possibly 7 tabs on an very other day basis.  I was thinking about switching to a ""new"" medicine but the Dr. said there is not one better than this.As for all you who have problems trying to sleep at night on Parnate_ I would recommend talking to your doctor about Klonopin.  I have been taking a .25mg 1/2tab for 25 years and never have had a problem with sleeping. Plus you get the added benefit that Klonopin also helps with Panic and Anxiety. Alot of Doctors will not subscribe Klonopin for use over a long period of time because some people can abuse this drug and get addicted to it. If your not an addictive type person I would recommend",F,50,25  years,4/28/2008,Parnate
88, 1, depression anxiety,Insomnia_ daytime tiredness,After really hoping this medication would work and getting my hopes up I am really dissatisfied.  One thing I notice is a temporary relief for about one three hours after I take the pill.  But I don't feel happy_ just numb_ but my anxiety is less.  I feel sort of zombie like on this med.  My personality is much duller and my moods are very uneven depending on when I take the pill.,F,,14  days,4/12/2008,Parnate
89, 5, depression,I do have a rapid  heartbeat when I take it ( 50 mg) which is in the morning. But I take propanalol for that.  I have no problems with  food restrictions. Just be  careful with cold medications with a decongestant_ demerol_ etc. Even surgery is no problem if you alert anesthesiologist to what you are  taking. They know what do do_ they've had to treat patients in the ER that were on Parnate. It is the best  drug I have had and really the only one that worked for  me. My only problem is that it's very very hard to fall asleep without help_ like Ambien. But after  years_ the side  effects of  Ambien ( vivid  nightmares) have made me try all kinds of behavioral changes.,I wish I  knew what to do about the  sleeplessness problem. The only time I really  feel tired is around 4 in the afternoon. I've  stopped talking a nap_ hoping that would help later on.,F,65,25  years,2/17/2008,Parnate
90, 5, Chronic depression.,NONE!,It is the first antidepressant that helped me for any period of time at all. I was tried on many before making a serious suicide attempt in 2004. In the hospital I was put on 60mg of Parnate_ plus Seroquel. I now take 70mg. Miraculously_ none of the prohibited foods affect me at all--red wine_ cheese_ all ok_ but that is very unusual.

91, 3, chronic depression,daily drowsiness and lethargy_ but insomnia if taken at night_ tingling goosebumps feelings_ fast hearbeat,I have taken 50mg parnate (generic tranylcypromine) and 50mg lamictal for depression ever since I got out of the psych hospital around 6 months ago. My depression seems to have gotten much better after starting these drugs_ but unfortunately it is difficult to tell which drug is responsible for my improvement. The side effects from both of these drugs are quite bothersome. Parnate causes me to be very drowsy and lethargic during the day and I often need to lay down and rest for a few hours_ but if I take it at night or in the afternoon_ I can't sleep.,M,20,6  months,1/16/2008,Parnate
92, 4, treatment-resistent depression,I have already rated parnate but I am now experiencing a new side effect I thought I would share_ insomnia.,I was taking serquel at the time of my last rating and since then it I became to tolerant of it_ I them moved on to a few more but nothing works for more then a night or 2. It seems they stimulants in parnate prevent me from sleeping days on end. It is not awful though because I do not feel tired_ and as long as its a 'good day' I enjoy the peaceful night (how long it is healthy to go without sleep though I am not sure). My doctor doesn't seem to have any suggestions either. right now i'm taking 30 mg dalmane_ it worked well (TOO WELL) for the first 2 days but then I became tolerant. When reading about it I read it was used for extreme insomnia and not to expect it to work for me then a week before tolerance builds up so I guess even the doctor is grasping as straws.,F,19,8  months,8/7/2007Email,Parnate
93, 5, treatment-resistent depression,light headed_ fainted very often in the beginning_ sensitive to a lot of sun_ no appetite for a few days,Started parnate at 30mg (10mg 3x a day) felt better right away for about a week and a half_ then back to how i was before. Once I got to about 40mg and had been taking it 2months and added topamax_ and seraquel to sleep I felt world better. I have tried almost every anti depressent and this is the first one to have any effect what so ever good or bad. It is amazing I think. Their have been articles stating if other antidepressants don't work you usallly need a rather high dose a parnate (maybe even up to 100mg a day - very high for parnate) depending on your size. I now am at 60mg and probably won't go higher because of size but it aboslutly amazing- i am finally starting to leave the house_ slowly beginning to communicate with people again. i suggest parnate!,F,19,120  days,6/22/2007Email,Parnate

I had a bad accident and was given many pain drugs which caused a chemical inbalance when I was taken off of them.

The H/C was the worst experience of my life and landed me in the local trauma center.
