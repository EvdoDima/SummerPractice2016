0, 5, For severe constipation.,Weight gain of 10 pounds and layer of fat around my stomach that I never had before!,"This works really well to stop constipation_ and promote regular eliminations_ but the weight gain and increased waist are not good. I normally don't have a problem with being overweight_ but this has caused a ""stubborn"" weight gain that is really_ really difficult to reverse.",F,62,6  months45 ML 1X D,9/8/2015,Lactulose
1, 1, Avoid constipation from other meds.,These aren't side effects_ they're full fledged EFFECTS! Severe gas_ pungent and goes forever. Cramps_ bloating_ distention_ I live in the bathroom. No diarrhea_ does soften stool_ but straining so much_ I ruptured a blood vessel. Am taking another drug for gastroparisis (erythromycin) that has similar effects. Comments on that are similar to this_ so I'm really not sure which is the cause. I have to find out_ so I can discontinue the correct one. It WORKS_ but at what cost?,This stuff is explosive at specified dosage. Cramps_ diarrhea_ and gas are adverse reactions according to  medical reports.,M,63,3  months1 til 3X/d,6/2/2015Email,Lactulose

4, 5, chronic constipation,very slight nausea_ gas,lactulose has helped me with the constipation I have due to another medication I am on.  The doc started me at 30-45mgs and told me I could increase it until it worked well for me.  I now take 2 TBS every day in the morning.  It took a few days to regulate my system_ but now everything is great and I feel so much better_ less bloated and miserable.,F,37,1  months30mg 1X D,11/17/2010,Lactulose
5, 5, chronic constipation,controllable flatulence,My problem with constipation is that I am very busy at work during the day and I forget to or ignore setting aside a time for a daily bowel movement.  By the time I get home in the evening_ I have no urge to go.  In a few days_ I am bloated and very uncomfortable.  The doctor told me to start at one tablespoon after breakfast and gradually increase the dosage so that my bowel movement urge was so powerful that it would be absolutely impossible to ignore or forget a daily bowel movement and then to stay at that dosage indefinitely.  I found that_ for me_ that point was 6 tablespoons.  Lactulose is funny stuff.  When you take it and for several hours afterwards_ it is though you have not taken it.  Then_ very gradually a bloated feeling develops.  There is continual gurgling feelings.  The bloated feeling becomes quite noticeable and you feel sensations of an impending bowel movement which actually does not happen for an hour or two.  By the time a bowel movement arrives_ there is an overwhelming_ irresistible_ panicky urge that you can in no way ignore for more than 30 minutes.  I've had some close calls with the bathroom when I was driving my car or away from a toilet for some reason.  You'll definitely be regular every day if you take lactulose.  Must be taken every day of your life to be effective.,M,50,5  years90 mg 1X D,11/14/2010Email,Lactulose
6, 5, improve bowel movements,causes gas,"I found that by adding a tablespoon of lactulose syrup directly to 1/4 cup All Bran_ with 1/4 cup fruit_ a tablespoon of flavored non-fat yogurt_ a tablespoon of muesli_ and 1/4 cup skim milk for breakfast_ my bowel movements greatly improved.  The lactulose acts as an artificial sweetener and when added to the bran it tastes a lot better and seems to do a better job of ""bulking"" than taken by itself.  As the French say_ ""bon defequer.""",M,65,2  years,1/10/2009,Lactulose
