4, 3, Lack of focus,Somnolence_ fatigue_ slight headaches_ slight tremor,Started Strattera to combat the racing thoughts and inattentiveness due to Bipolar 2 disorder. Not sure if I'm also ADD but I cannot keep my mind focused_ my thoughts just seems to bounce from one to another. I can walk into a room and forget why I'm there. So far_ the tiredness is really affecting my productivity. I'm unmotivated to do anything except veg out on the sofa. Just to note I'm also on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg_ Latuda 20 mg_ and lamotrigine 100 mg. I take all the meds in the morning except the latuda which I take before bed. Hopefully things get better soon.Update: 7/24/16 After taking Strattera for about 2.5 months at 40 mg a day I am still torn on its effectiveness. Initially after about 4-5 weeks I had an couple days of complete focus and follow through. I was able to organize my home_ get rid of a pile of old papers and mail I had been procrastinating on going through_ and overall felt like I was able to complete a task before moving on to the next. I was excited! Unfortunately_ those effects didn't last long but my psyc kept me at that dose for another month and a half. I am now on my 2nd day at 60 mg. I'm not sure if I feel much of a difference at this point but I think I feel a little more jittery but just slightly. I do have an essential tremor so maybe that is what's going on. I am having an increase in being so exhausted that I have to take 1-2 hour nap. Sudden dizziness that only lasts a few seconds and slight headaches occur occasionally.,F,35,3  months60mg 1X D,7/24/2016EmailHistory,Strattera

6, 5, ADHD,Nausea is the #1 side effect for me and then_ the strange dreams.  The sleepiness is strong the first month.,After_ the sleepiness wouldn't go away_ I switched the time I take it.  I take it early evening around 6/7pm. I don't have sleepiness during the day. The nausea is for a little bit after I take it_ then it fades.  I used to have a voracious sex drive but now it's normal. I would eat a large steak dinner with all the trimmings and be hungry in 2hrs. But now_ I eat normal and I don't think about eating all the time.  I don't have the temper I used to have and I can plan normal and concentrate on one thing at a time as well as multi-task appropriately. I know this must sound like a commercial_ but_ I worked on one thing at a time.  Strattera has a great behavior modification med for me.  As the behaviors changed the anxiety reduced_ the temper reduced_ the concentration improved because I didn't have as much on my mind from the anxiety.  I have gone off of it sometimes over the years...due to annoyance with the nausea or if I had to work nights for a short period.  Couldn't do that long term because the lack of concentration.  But overall_ It has worked for me. It will not fix it all at once and be careful mixing it with other ADD/ADHD meds and especially anti-depressants.  Remember_ this med REGULATES. It will demand normal sleep patterns and eating patterns.  Also_ exercise helps with energy.  Energy makes energy.  Whatever exercise your doctor approves...walking or something makes this med seem like a wonder drug.,F,45,12  years40 mg 1X D,6/23/2016,Strattera
7, 3, Forgetfulness_ losing things_ Impat,Impotence and other sexual side effects.,Didn't notice much of anything at first as expected. It doesn't seem to be a miracle drug that works quickly or completely removes all symptoms_ but I'm still going to give it a lot more time to make a final judgement. I have noticed that I am a bit more calm and react less extreme to upsetting things_ but I'm still a bit forgetful and impatient. It seems to be helping my anxiety better than my adhd. I think if I don't notice anything after about two months I will try something new. The only reason I'm not taking concerta which has worked in the past is that my insurance won't cover it for whatever reason. I do feel strongly that this medicine has a lot of potential though as I already feel a little more calm. I also feel a bit more in control of where I put my attention.,M,23,3  weeks40 MG 1 a,6/8/2016Email,Strattera
8, 4, ADD_ Anxiety,NauseaTiredWeird Sleep,Been on and off for many years. When I start_ I feel like I have the flu. Exhausted_ tingly_ weird dreams. Almost drunk feeling! After a week or so I feel better and side effects disappear slowly. 3 months into 40mg I have no side effects but the effectiveness isn't as good. Now I'm at 80mg_ took it at night and slept so light...felt very awake and had vivid dreams. Taking it in the morning and I'm so nauseous! But it's worth it when the side effects wear off. Doesn't give me the kick like stimulants but once I start on something I can focus and am not easily distracted. Extra thoughts are more streamlined too. Less anxiety because of this! My brain functions almost simpler? It's nice.,F,30,3  days40-80mg,5/24/2016Email,Strattera

10, 5, ADHD/ADD,The most insane INITIAL side effects I've ever had starting a medication. Dizziness and nausea mostly. The first two days were the worst_ it felt like I was drunk.

11, 2, ADD,Started at 40 mg once per day.  Extreme dry mouth_ in a daze_ feeling very confused and SO tired.  Eyes felt buggy and unable to normally regain focus between objects (like_ from looking at someone talking_ then look at my phone_ it was all blurry for a minute).  Not confirmed_ but I think it may have raised my BP and heartrate.  I called the doc_ they dropped me to 18 mg.  Symptoms all the same but much less.  I am on day 4 of 18mg.  Feeling a little loopy_ a little bit of dry mouth_ and feel wired.  Coffee makes it worse. My sleep has been terrible - sleeping very lightly every night_ never seeming to get into deep sleep_ yet when I wake up in the morning_ I am WIDE AWAKE.  No nausea_ no stomach issues.,Going to stick this out for another week or so.  I am also on 300mg Bupropion for anxiety.  Doc said that a stimulant would make my anxiety worse so he prescribed Strattera.  I'm thinking I'd rather test that theory and deal with a day of anixiety then these persistent weird symptoms and inability to sleep....,F,40,2  days40mg 1X D,3/29/2016Email,Strattera

13, 5, ADHD,A small amount of nausea_ first two days on Straterra I was sleepy. The longer I was on it_ the more increased energy. Strange dreams.,I love straterra. I am able to focus_ stay on task and can pay attention. It seems the longer I've been on it_ the better.  After a while the side effects subside.  It also calms my nervous twitches. I feel that this is a steady_ level fix. (Adderall was a spur of the moment fix with agitation side effects) I am completely happy with this medication.,F,37,3  months80mg,3/21/2016,Strattera
14, 3, ADHD,Nausea_ extreme sweating_ extremely heat intolerant_ migraine auras (no headache)_ exercise intolerance-short of breath with any exertion_,I am very disappointed because this medication was helping me concentrate. It was added to my other medications because I couldn't concentrate after interning during the day and I'm in grad school. The heat...I can't explain how uncomfortable and bad it feels. I just took my temperature and either this new Walgreens thermometer is broken or something is wrong. It read 94.5 degrees F. I tried oral and under my arm. I had to take my coat off outside because I was dripping with sweat and exhausted. It was 30 degrees out. The nausea did not start until about 5 or more days of taking 80 mg after the typical sample pack titration.  My doc think nausea starts right away if you get that side effect; for me it started after a week on 80 mg. I don't know what else I can do but to go off; ASAP. I feel like a trip to immediate care is around the corner if I keep taking this. the positive effect of this medication is that there is no speedy feeling or vacillating ability to concentrate. It's very steady but the focus gets lost under the blanket of heat and sweat I experience.  I think I will try exercise.  I read an article about a student with ADHD who raced his bicycle and did not need adhd meds. The training and exercise helped him focus. I hope it works. Generally_ after the heat dissipates and the nausea subsides_  it's time to go to bed; like right now. Then_ I get up and try again_ thinking it was my imagination.,F,60,45  days80 MG 1X D,3/20/2016Email,Strattera

18, 5, Adult ADHD-PI,At 40mg: Nausea_ headache_ insomnia. At 80mg: Vomiting_ nausea_ headache_ fatigue_ urinary hesitation_ abnormal dreams. All resolved in 3 weeks at 80mg.,It's a shame to see comments from other patients that say they're giving up on Strattera after one or two weeks. I had a VERY rough time at first_ but was determined to stick with it and I'm extremely happy with the results. Initially the nausea was so bad I had to sit still and close my eyes to keep from vomiting. For a few days it was hard to urinate. The fatigue was so strong at one point I basically spent three days in bed. After two weeks at 80 mg_ I felt like crap_ and my symptoms hadn't improved. But I knew that I had to stay on it for longer to see how it would affect me long term. Oh boy_ am I glad that I did! Before Strattera_ I would find it near impossible to start a task. Once I did start_ I'd easily become distracted by my own thoughts. I had problems with losing focus_ even if people were speaking to me directly.Life on Strattera is better. I don't 'feel' it working - now that the side effects are gone_ I don't 'feel' anything when I take it. But I know it's working because it's helping my symptoms. I can now focus for about the same length of time as someone without ADHD. I no longer have entire days lost to procrastination.Of course sometimes_ I still procrastinate. I can still lose focus during a conversation if I'm not careful. But now it feels like most of my symptoms can be overcome most of the time with enough willpower. That was impossible before. Don't let initial side effects put you off!,M,27,8  weeks80 mg 1X D,12/16/2015,Strattera
19, 5, Non-stimulant ADHD medication,Dry mouth_ occasional night sweats_ occasional slight anxiety but nothing unmanageable,I love Strattera. I've been on it three different times (going on and off of it for various reasons) and each time it really doesn't start working for about a month or a month and a half_ so you really have to give it time to build up in your system. It's very different from a stimulant in that way. The reason I started Strattera the first time was after failed use of Vyvanse and Ritalin. They made me jittery and extremely anxious (I had previously been diagnosed with anxiety_ so it makes sense that a stimulant would make my anxiety worse.) I also found that at the end of the day_ I could not focus anymore. It was as if I had never taken it. This was really upsetting to me because_ being a college student_ I needed to be focused all of the time and that just wasn't happening. Strattera has been my miracle drug. Nothing else has helped me like this has. I honestly would have dropped out of college if it weren't for Strattera. I can't say enough good things about it. I would definitely recommend taking a chance with Strattera. Give it time and it will change your life.,F,19,2  months40 mg,11/25/2015,Strattera

22, 4, ADD,Initially increased energy levels and noticeable increase in focus especially in the gym.  Strange and irritating side effect was increased susceptibility to cold after sweating that would result in me getting the chills and becoming nauseated.  Constipation and lack of urine pressure were other minor side effects.  Even when I try to force urine out faster I can't seem to be able to_ just a slow steady stream that doesn't always seem to get it all out. These side effects seem to be wearing off.  Currently the main side effect is highly increased sex drive.,I feel like I can stay on task for a longer period of time but does not necessarily increase my focus in general.  I also had a history of depression and anti social behavior but am starting to notice a general level of contentment and a desire to be more social.  By reading the other reviews on this site_ it seems like the symptoms may continue to develop and evolve for months so I plan to stay at my current dosage for a while to continue to monitor how my body reacts.,M,32,1  months100 mg,10/4/2015,Strattera

28, 1, ADHD,My son was placed on Strattera when he was 10 yrs old_ when it was 1st approved by FDA in Jan 2003. After 3 miserable week's with no help with ADHD & him crying_ raging_ suicidal his Pediatrician put him back on 10 to 15 MG of Adderall per day & he calmed down & was able to focus again. Right after my son's terrible experience with Strattera_ my oldest son's Band Teacher confided in me that he also had ADHD & had an appointment with his Dr. to begin treatment with Stattera_ I told him about our experience & to be careful. Within 4 week's of starting treatment our H.S.Band teacher had a complete nervous breakdown_ was suicidal & hosptilized. He was in therapy for a very long time & was not able to continue as Band Teacher. It took over a year for him to start giving private lessons_ it was devastating for him & my son. I don't recommend it unless you are supervised by Dr. constantly. It almost ended my son's life & wrecked my friend's life. He was lucky to have lived & his wife_ children_ career_ finances were all severely jeopardized by Strattera.,I'm suprized to see that Stattera is still being used for ADHD along with depression. I'm stunned to see all of these comment's_ I had no idea that it caused impotance_ as well as severe depression. I would strongly caution to any parent or adult to be very careful with this medication. It is definitely dependent on each person's own chemical makeup. I read some people had good responses_ and I'm grateful they did not have the nightmare experience that my son & my friend_ our son's Band Teacher had. That was a horrific year I'll never forget.,M,10,3  weeks25 mg,8/9/2015,Strattera

Feeling great_ otherwise!,This stuff has worked wonders for me.  Seriously_ life-changing.  I don't feel so lost/confused/anxious/worried all the time.  When something needs to be done_ holy crap_ I ACTUALLY DO IT!  I'm not as distracted by stimulation (sights_ sounds_ smells_ etc).  I can do tasks in sequential order.  My mind is not being controlled by a freaking monkey anymore.  I can't believe how well this works for my Inattentive-type ADD.  The best part is I don't feel like anything about me has changed - my personality is exactly the same_ except that I am productive and can listen to conversations without zoning out after 2 seconds.  I am less impulsive too; my brain is not constantly interrupting my life anymore.    I am surprised to read all of the crazy side effects as I really don't have any of them_ except for vivid dreams and I feel weird if I take it in the morning without eating.  I can literally feel it start to kick in about 45 minutes after I take it_ and it usually starts wearing off around 8pm.  It's supposed to be 24-hour coverage_ I think it sticks around in your system but I can definitely feel it when it is wearing off.,F,33,25  days80mg 1X D,2/16/2015Email,Strattera

Day one: extreme raynauds disease symptoms in my toes (I have raynauds but have not had an attack this severe ever_ had to stand in bath for 30 mins to feel my feet again). Day two another severe raynauds attack and I had a small glass of red wine and suffered tingling in my jaw and extreme redness and hot flush feeling my face almost feels like my face is swollen (I asked the psychiatrist if I could drink socially on this drug and he said it was ok as long as not heavy drinking),Im going to continue taking this drug for upto a month and see how it goes as I understand this is a build up drug but think I may go back to concerta if Raynauds side effect continues,M,29,2  days40MG 1X D,12/12/2014Email,Strattera
46, 5, ADHD (comorbid w/ bipolar disorder),sleepiness (first week)_ vomiting_ extreme nausea (first week)_ loss of appetite_ weight loss,Of all the meds I've tried_ Strattera was the hardest to get used to. The first week and a half was really rough and I nearly threw in the towel a few times. But was it ever worth it! After my bipolar was under my control I noticed other symptoms that were hidden behind bipolar. I was diagnosed with ADHD. I didn't know how bad my ADHD was until Strattera took away the complications of the disorder! I feel more focused_ and calm then I have in years.The nausea (worst I ever had) and vomiting stopped after the first two weeks or so. So did the sleepiness. Now I feel alive and happy again. Colors are litterally brighter and I am able to drive again without getting distracted. I still have no appetite and no longer crave my comfort foods. Eating was my version of fidgetting. I have lost 7.3 pounds since the first of November but I also had lots to lose and have drastically changed my eating habits since starting the pill. I am finally remembering to take my bipolar meds too! Fantastic medication - if you can get through the adjustment period!,F,26,18  days40mg 1X D,11/17/2014,Strattera

48, 1, ADHD Inattentive Type,Crabbiness_ Irritability_ Hostile_ OD on sleeping pills on first (and only day) of 40 mg dose. Hospitalization in Adolescent Mental Heath Unit for 3 days.,"My 16 year old son started taking this med to help with his ADD. He was on it for 27 days at 25mg. HE didn't think it was working and had scheduled a visit with hs doctor. He stopped taking it for three days before the doctor visit. This ""break"" was not planned but ended up being helpful in the end. He was NICE during the three day break. Acting silly_ laughing_ being sociable. HE had been an anti-social crab the month of the drug. The doc upped his dose to 40mg. A few hours after his first 40 mg dose_ he snapped at me and was unusually crabby. I immediately put 2 and 2 together. The niceness of the previous three says and the instant crabbiness when he got on the increased dose. Later that day he over dosed on sleeping pills. He swears he was ""just trying to sleep"" but.... He ended up in hospital for three days. Now he's medication free and back to his normal self. I call this the ""^^^hole drug"". I think it made him so irritated that he couldn't stand to be in his own skin that day. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! Scary scary stuff!",M,16,27  days25mg 1X D,11/8/2014,Strattera

My sleep was weird like i could hear the tv and comprehend everything. The 2nd and 3 rd week i would get angry at a drop of a hat. I literally wanted to unzip myself out my skin. The docotor pushed for me to stay on. The fourth week was the final straw. I was in a haze_ almost like i wasent in body. I got in a minor tiff with my bf and went in my house and punched a plate. Thank god i didnt take ny dose that night...the next morning i was irratable but not in haze. I realized that this wasent me . Told the doxotor to take both bottles back. Thank god i quit .

I was VERY worried about the side effects of the drug as I had a bad reaction to an antidepressant a few years ago.  So far I have had no major side effects_ no nausea_ no stomach pain_ nothing except some appetite loss and tiredness.

This drug has allowed me to be able to get to sleep at night instead of having my mind race. Be able to read more than a page in a book without starting to daydream and forget what im reading. People say that I'm more organized with my storys instead of going off in tangents. I don't like the feeling of being on drugs and with Adderall and Ridilin you feel like a drug is forcing you to concentrate. Strattera isnt going to make you do anything_ it just seems to allow you to focus more and have more clarity.,F,31,9  years80ml 1X D,5/17/2014,Strattera

He doesn't seem to have a grip on reality.,My son was on Concerta for 3 years & done great. He was maxed out with his growth spurts & dosage & it stopped working as well. Adderall made him very violent & now strattera seems to be doing that as well. We were trying to do non-stimulants but it just isn't working. I'm torn & not sure what to do. My son used to be very compassionate & loving. He liked to be funny_ he loved to laugh & had a big personality but was unable to focus & finish tasks even in structured environments. Now my son is not himself & no one can handle him the way he currently is. He started on 20mg of straterra & has increased each month by 20 mg. each month the side effects become worse. His dr says we must give it time & refuses to take him off. I'm in search of a new dr. Please beware.

62, 1, Adult ADD,First dose was late afternoon.  Couldn't get to sleep that night and my penis shrank and I became completely impotent.  This was at starter pack low dose_ I guess 25mg.  Nose ran for the first week and every time the dosage increased.  Felt like a light acid trip.  Dry mouth_ constipation_ hot flashes_ sweating_ fatigue the first week.  Increased to 45mg_ 60_ then 80 and symptoms increased each time but leveled off after a week.  Follow up with Dr. after 30 days after my last pill_ advised side effects and she apolgized for prescribing this to me and put me on stimulant.,This worked right away as far as improving my ability to focus.  I could absolutely PLOW through work. Everything I procrastinated over in the past I accomplished.  However_ it changes your personality.  I was very melancoly the first week_ mostly lost interest in sex because of impotence_ ejaculating while flacid_ ejaculate discharging before climax_ then nothing coming out_ lost my breath quite a bit_ but also had occasional feelings of satisfaction.  By the time I hit 80mg my default mood was sour.  I had a frown that I could feel all the time.  I wasn't pissed_ and didn't lose my temper_ but I could just tell I wasn't happy and this was my new base.  Dr. switched me to somethign else and I'm tapering off.  First day down to 40mg and when stimulant wears off I'm basically a vegetable and cannot think at all.  I think they're on the right path with this medicine but they need better execution.  This is seriously strong stuff_ similiar to controlled LSD to me.  It may have wrecked my marriage.  Oh_ and don't drink on it.  One or two is fine_ but if you have 5 or 6 you'll be destroyed.  Nice thing is it controls your appetite.  I wound up with anxiety I guess as I started picking at my nails all the time.  I realized it and couldn't stop.  First day on reduced dose that stopped.

Foggy thinking and horrible hot flashes were attributed to perimenipause; might it be the Strattera? Night sweats began three months ago; cannot live this way.

65, 3, ADD,Titrating up and the first 6 weeks was god-awful_ side-effect wise_ and I reacted very badly to 80 MG.  Taking it in the morning made me exhausted all day_ taking it at night made me wake up with weird hot flashes (or made me unable to sleep at all).Over 5 months in_ I'm still feeling exhausted on a regular basis_ and my stamina for any kind of physical movement has decreased *very* dramatically.  Climbing stairs is hard now!  My motivation levels have dropped in tandem with my physical energy.,Am planning to lower my dosage and consider going off the medication in the next 2 weeks.  From week 6 to about the mid-3rd month I really liked the med--I could focus whenever I wanted during the day_ without having to plan to take an adderall_ etc_ at the right time.

The first few days were GREAT.  I've loved how it calms my excessive thoughts_ thus improving my attention. However_ this past week I noticed some irritability_ a bit of anxiety returning_ but the worse part is I started getting a LOT of scalp hair coming out in the shower (not breakage_ but with the follicle attached)!  Does this side effect go away??  I hate to stop taking it_ but I CANNOT lose my hair!  :-(  I have had this side effect with a couple of other medications (rare side effect) and have no idea what causes it.  It makes me sad to think I will have to quit taking it as it has really helped me.  I am not taking any other meds and have had my thyroid checked.

67, 5, ADHD,None besides headache if I forget to take it one day.,Strattera is wonderful. It won't help anyone who doesn't have ADHD or ADD. Both of these are the most misdiagnosed conditions. Oh you can't concentrate? You have ADHD.....How about cutting dyes and sugar out of your diet first before going down the ADD route. I have a very strict diet for my ADHD_ but I also need this medication or I'm super hyper. If you give me red dyes or sugar you better get out of the room. With Strattera I don't have to worry about manic swings like you get with Adderall. I am not bi-polar but when I tried Adderall you couldn't tell. I've tried many drugs and this is the only effective one that doesn't have serious side effects.,F,23,9  years25 MG 1X D,4/2/2013Email,Strattera

Almost painful.On day 4_ I realised I'd become 100% impotent! To check whether it was just a one-time problem_ my partner gave me a blowjob later that day. Still zero (!) erection. 100% dead penis. That obviously makes Strattera a no-go for me.And then I checked my blood pressure!!! 165/105 - with a pulse of 93!!! Not acceptable. I'm usually at 134/85 with a pulse of 65.I had no other side effects apart from tiredness the first two days.,"I know effects of Strattera will only be seen after a few weeks_ but judging by the first four days_ especially the fourth_ I'd assume Strattera would make me lethargic in the long run.

70, 2, Add,I didnt experience many side effects while working up to my target dose (in the first month). I had a little insomnia and noticed that i ate less (which was a bonus!). The therapeutic effect was noticeable within the first 2 weeks. My mind was quieted enough to where i could complete a task without leaving it to start another (which was a new concept for me). I wondered how i had actually gotten anything done before.Then_ about 2 months in_ i noticed that i had very little to say to my friends and family_ which is very uncharacteristic of the person i am. I noticed that i had less motivation and less pleasure. I decided to keep an eye on it. About 3 1/2 months in_ i had crying outbursts_ felt hopeless and negative about the future_ was completely disinterested in sex and actually contemplated suicide. This is not normal for me.  I decided to abruptly stop taking Strattera after thinking about it for weeks.  It is the third day without the med and already i feel like i am returning to my self. I'm enjoying music again_ feeling more talkative and more positive and hopeful. Withdrawal symptoms are bareable: fogginess_ mild headache and a little lethargy.

72, 3, I have ADHA,Trouble sleeping_ tired sometimes_ mild headaches_,I was diagnosed as a child but my mother put me on a diet meant for ADHD_ it really did help at the time. Doctor's didn't know much back then so they thought I would grow out of it. I did poor in school and am now returning for the first time in 22+ years to college. When I started taking Strattera it made me feel like i wasn't there_ The next day I took it anyway and found the results were very different. I could think and felt great but I noticed I had trouble sleeping. Almost like you are half awake the whole night_ any noise will wake you easily. I have noticed a few headaches and can't retain information given for long. They want me to up my dose to 80mg and I am afraid to if this is what the side effects are right now. Will they get worse? If so I will not risk school for my medication. Not sure what to do about anything_ I know I did better at school before I took the medication. I learned to adapt to my ADHD to some point. I still have shinny thing issues( I am sure you know what I mean). This drug may be good for some but I am not sure if it's the right one for me. I don't like taking medication anyway. I also recommend eating before medication and eat at least 5x a day. I did find my headaches were less if I ate more and drank plenty of fluids.,F,41, 40mg 1X D,9/12/2012Email,Strattera
73, 1, Trying a new ADHD medication,Well this *safe* *non-addicting* medication seemed like a good idea at the time_ finally a *new* ADHD med that builds up in your system_ similar to the way SSRI's do before you can see they're true efficacy.. Well_ I tried to follow the starter pack I received from my psychiatrist_ but the psychological side-effects were too overwhelming! This drug made my anxiety_ irritably level_ and anger go thru the roof! It's  like EVERYTHING even the smallest of things pissed me off to no end_ and it was like I was on a short fuse ready to blow at any minute! I didn't even get to see if this medicine helped with my focus or motivation_ I was too busy trying to calm my ridiculous rage! So my recommendation is that unless you absolutely CANNOT tolerate any first line treatment  stimulant drug (IR or XR) that doctors almost always prescribe first_ just be careful and VERY aware of the side effects of Strattera. Remember it's not a SSRI (think Prozac) it's  not a NDRI or DRI (think Ritalin/Focalin) and it's definitely not a NDRA or DRA like amphetamines of all types (think adderall_ vyvanse_ dextrostat_ even methamphetamine) it's a NRI so it only_ in theory_ works on norepinepherine & thus adrenaline..

I am generally a very happy_ calm_ patient person and after taking only 2 pills of the 18 MG (my doctor wanted me to slowly increase my dose to 60MG) I started feeling irritable and tired. After I took a nap I woke up only to feel worse and sad_ for no reason what-so-ever. I cried and could not even think of a reason for why I was crying.

At first_ there were very limited side effects with this drug.  As the months went by_ I started to notice some pronounced changes in my sons behaviour.  This boy went from being someone who would not hurt a fly_ to getting into altercations at school.  His grades started to slip_ and his mood drastically changed.  He finally opened up up to his dad the other day that he was seeing things and having bad thoughts of hurting people and himself.  I immediately took him off of the drug.  It has been three days since he has taken Strattera.  He has calmed down and is feeling a little better.  This drug is pure poison.  His paediatrician said that it was safe and that there were minor side effects...that is bull.  He has since retired and my son is due to see his new doctor shortly.

80, 1, add_ depression,memory loss_ loss of conceptual ability_ disinterest in work and lack of focus_ insomnia alternating with extreme fatigue,I descended almost immediately into a fog upon taking the first dose of this medication.  I lost the ability to conceptualize_ pretty much all of my short term memory_ and motivation to complete work.  My brain turned in to swiss cheese.  Now_ 15 days after my second dose ( I lasted two days before I quit) my mind is more like cheesecloth_ I am retaining some info but without the ability to retain everything.  School has become a nightmare where I am a 4.0 student and I live in terror of not being able to complete the semester successfully.

But after it was switched out with a generic (which I later learned is the exact same drug)_ I decided to try Strattera_ lured in with the promise of 24 hour ADD coverage_ and a potential reduction in my tics.I knew obviously it would take a few weeks to come into effect_ yet on the very first day I began experiencing the side effects_ virtually all the ones described all in one day.I thought nothing of the fatigue at first_ and napped after four hours of being awake from a full night's sleep.  Then I realized I was still fatigued later that day.Sex drive was also negatively impacted_ and fluids ran liberally with very little stimulation.  Urethra tended to burn during orgasm_ only slightly unpleasant.Also realized on second day that it had been 3 days since last I went to the bathroom and still I felt no need to.  On third day (today) I felt no need and it is now late at night_ 4 days without going to the bathroom once_ where previously my schedule was once every 1-2 days.On second day almost had an anxiety/panic attack or episode of some kind_ nothing major but definitely out of the ordinary.It's only been three days_ and i'm sure the medicine would work for most people_ but I don't really have any reason to be on it (Concerta worked fine for me with virtually no side effects).

Thats says it all for me.  One thing that is very noticeable is my incredible inability to sleep.  I work an 8-5_ M-F and I exercise on a daily basis and from 9pm when I hit the sheets_ I toss and turn until well after midnight.  What sleep I do get isn't quality sleep.  I take Venlafaxine_ which like I mentioned_ is a generic form of Effexor used to treat depression.  Both Strattera and Venlafaxine are SSRI's_ and both have similar side effects.  I am thinking about titrating off of Venlafaxine (the withdrawal symptoms are horrendous!) in favor of Strattera since they are both known to treat mild depression.  Perhaps eliminating one might alleviate the side effects I am experiencing.  If the sleepless nights continue_ I am likely to drop Straterra since the benefits are mild compared to the very apparent side effects I am experiencing.

108, 5, Adult Inattentive ADHD_ OCD,Stomach upset_ difficulty sleeping through the night_ always hungry.,I've been through quite a few stimulant medications and finally told my doctor I was through with them. Was prescribed Strattera (by my own request; I do a lot of research) and have been feeling really_ well.. good! Today for the first time since stopping stimulants I managed to finish everything in my work day and even started on some of the next shift's work. I honestly got bored with surfing the internet_ something that I usually get stuck doing for hours_ and got up to tidy my apartment instead. It's certainly a different feeling from stimulants_ more of a self-directed feeling of goodness and wanting to get things done rather than the panicked overenergized nature of adderall/ritalin. The side effects haven't bothered me too much. In fact the feeling of always being hungry has *helped* because I had lost so much weight on adderall I was basically a twig with limbs. Gained over 5 pounds since starting Strattera and steadily approaching healthy weight. Best of all I don't have to force myself to eat!

So in comparison_ this medication has been a relief. I have an almost constant feeling of contentment--sometimes elation--which may be from my heretofore untreated depression finally getting some medication that helps. But it's not like being in a medicine fog either. It's like before it was darkness under my skin_ and now there's a lightness. Also_ personality very much intact and feeling creative_ expansive. Me_ only happy. Weird. A few physical side effects_ nothing that bothers me much_ although I could use more sleep. My concentration is somewhat improved_ although not the razor-focus that adderall had for those lovely two weeks when it worked. The bonus was the increased libido. Mine has been meh ever since I started hormonal birth control (an progestorone IUD now) and all of a sudden I have the appetite of a teenager. Maybe even a teenaged boy.

At first things were going ok_ better reports from the school_ very little side effects_ and just mild headaches that were easily dismissed with Tylenol. Then we started noticeing him forgetting things. Then asking us if something really happened or if he dreamed it. Then one day he went to my parents house (they live on the same property)and then came home two minutes later. I asked if ""paw paw"" was not home and he said he couldn't rememeber. I said well did you see him_ he said I don't know_ I said ok did you see him or not when you drove the four wheeler down there. He said I don't remember if I drove down there or not!

127, 4, ADD,At first there is alot of nausea but after the 2nd week id dies down but never realy left. Seem to have sleeping porblems but not major_ same as ritalin. Also seem to be very sleepy around the afternoon often. lately been feeling sick and abnormaly bad stmoache aches but not sure if it could be mounting pressure and stress so not blaming the drug. in first 1 or so peeing did sting a bit. appitite is fine compared to what ritalin did but sometime occiasionaly dont eat lunch. coffe seems to upset my stomach if i drink it just after i take it.,started of with 40mg for 3 days then 60mg for 4 then jumped to 100 for a week and then went back down to 80mg for a week the back up to 100mg. what seems to help with nausea is ginger lemon tea or eating some fruit before and after taking the dosage. just a suggestion for beginners to stick it out first 2 weeks are the worst_ after than you'll see the advantages and side affects will die down. Also unlike ritalin this doesnt supress my personality as much or cause depression_ i find it is much easier to socialize and talk to my friends. also my confidence has boosted and i feel much more relaxed.,M,17,2  months100mg 1X D,10/31/2010Email,Strattera

No significant change in mood or concentration.  I'm just as spacey as before the meds. :\,Luckily_ my hubby and mom notice my lack of appetite_ so i get good_ healthy food in me.  I have to take a 1-2 hour nap after work_ force myself to wake up and try to get to bed a little early since I wake (completely alert) around 4 every night.

My Dr. warned me of some side affects and is determined to watch me closely - I plan to give it a chance since this is the the only drug in my system and I feel it can be controlled and fine tuned with good observation and finding the right time of day to take it.

136, 2, ADHD & TS,,"In response to S's question (your email address doesn't work): My son is definitely more stable now than he was when he was taking Strattera. We have not made any other changes_ so I truly believe that Strattera was the culprit to his extreme unreasonableness_ irritability_ anger_ etc. My son is still fairly irritable and difficult to deal with_ but on Strattera there seemed to be an additional layer of this that was not ""him."" It was like he had no control over some of his reactions. He was also entirely unaware of how he came across. When we discussed this with his psychiatrist_ she did say that this is a known but rare reaction to Strattera. She urged us to give the med some more time_ and we did. But since there were really no positive effects in terms of increased focus and the amped up unreasonableness and anger continued_ we discontinued Strattera. So my son is again taking no medication. He is 16 year old and is displaying a lot of teenage behavior - pushes limits_ argues_ is moody and irritable_ etc. But off Strattera he isn't ALWAYS this way - he can also be insightful_ caring_ responsible_ etc. He still has his ADHD issues with impulsivity_ forgetfulness_ disorganization...It is my opinion that Strattera enhanced my son's irritability and anger and even made him ""unreachable"" when he had gotten himself worked up enough.

140, 2, ADD from Bipolar Mania,I took this medicine December 2009. In addition to bipolar type II_ I have Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) which I think is a product of the manic state or medication induced (probably abilify). Since stimulants sometimes induce mania the Nurse Practitioner prescribed Strattera (Atomoxetine). Before I could ramp it up to the recommended therapeutic strength (100 mg)_ the side effects got in the way. I had a starter pack and had gone up in dosage to 80 mg in four weeks. At 80 mg the medication made me manic; that mania crossed over into mixed state within hours. I felt angrier and more irritated on it_ then extremely depressed. Very unwanted side effects. At this point 400 mg of Lamictal_ 5 mg of Abilify and 300 mg of Seroquel XR tether me to normalcy(whatever that is) and this drug definitely doesn't go well with that mix.

166, 1, ADD,Nightmares_ tremors_ sleep problems_ paranoia_ extreme lethargy_ severe depression.,"I recently found that I had been misdiagnosed for years.  I changed doctors and went to a highly regarded doctor who extensively questioned and tested me to diagnose me with Bipolar II or Soft Bipolar.  With everything I've learned_ it makes unbelievable sense.  It's a new designation_ only recognized this year.  The constantly being tired_ distractability_ memory problems - the drugs working for a couple of months and then ""poof""_ the benefits were gone.  All clues to Bipolar II.  I've always slept eight hours a night so I did NOT consider this to be a possibility.  The Vyvanse and anti-depressants helping temporarily but just masking the real problems.  Particularly interesting is that mixing two anti-depressants can send a Bipolar II or Soft Bipolar in a psychotic episodes (or ""manic"" or ""hypomanic"" periods).  I myself was also on Prozac and the combination made me nearly psychotic and suicidal.  My doctor is slowly taking me off anti-depressants and adding Seroquel.  In five years_ the doctor says_ my brain will regenerate and I will experience life as I have never known it to be.

We have come a long way with her behavior until strattera was added for consentration purposes. YES_ it has improved with that_ HOWEVER_ it is not worth the side effects that our little girl is feeling. Her personality is NOTHING like our daughter. She is constantly getting in trouble for being verbally agressive and for doing things she knows isn't right. This has only been going on for about a month_ or so....she has only been on the medicine for about 2 months...thus making me think that a lot of this is the combination of the medicines. I am going to call the doctor on Monday to see what we can do...it breaks my heart to see our daughter cry with bags under her eyes because part of her knows she isn't acting like our daughter_ but she can't help herself...it is heartbreaking as a mother to see this!,F,7,8  weeks,1/29/2010Email,Strattera

Immediately I gained focus from morning throughout the day_ I wasn't tired and unmotivated all day as I used to be.  I became less irritable with people_ distractions_ noise.  I can listen without interrupting constantly.  I do not go into talking marathons.  My thoughts and conversation do  not split off into dozens of tangents_ or new topics altogether.  I am not running around trying to do ten things at once_ becoming overwhelmed_ then ultimately melting down and not fininshing any of them. Previously you would not have found me responding to this or any survey for example.  I found that for me taking it at night is best_ since it makes me sleepy_ and although I still experience some sleep disturbance the sleep I do get is much more produc-tive.  I feel rested upon waking whereas before treatment I never felt rested_ although I would sleep the clock round_ nor did I feel motivated to accomplish much of anything_ much less set goals and meet them. It all seemed to be too much.   In other words_ regardless of the side effects the benefit I experience has greatly outweighed the negatives.

Although this is my FIRST day taking the drug_ I don't want to continue taking it -although the side effects are not as severe as that with Ritalin & Concerta_ they are surely not pleasant. I can't concentrate as all i want to do is sleep_ i am dizzy when i move about_ and the thought of eatting makes my stomach feel ill.

My heart would race and I would sweat a little for about 40 minutes and then all was well.  When I forgot to take the meds for a few days those symptoms were greatly intensified. Once_ when I was also on my cycle all of the symptoms from the medication and period were combined.  I was crouching on the floor at work in sheer misery.,"Strattera mostly benefited me and enabled me to take a daytime job.  Previously I preferred to work at night because I was almost impossible to wake up.  I did have jobs in the morning but I would never hear my alarms going off. My work life suffered_ personal relationships suffered because I would stay up all night long.  When I started taking Strattera I noticed instantly that I could discipline myself to go to bed at a decent time and getting up in the morning was SO much easier.  I was able to concentrate and focus on the task at hand.  My friends said that I seemed calmer and that I didn't interrupt and ""go all over the place"" with my conversations.  Life was good.  But then in April 2007 I experienced some shortness of breath while at work and ended up going to the ER with a resting heart rate of 132.  Maybe a few months later I weaned myself off of the drug.. with side effects mentioned earlier_ but my heart rate continued to stay high. I have since had to carry an albuterol inhaler at all times and I STILL experience random shortness of breath more times than I would like.  As I write this_ I have been battling with an episode and plan to see a Pulmonary Specialist about these prolonged symptoms I have experienced some 18 months after discontinuing Strattera.",F,33,5  years,1/6/2010Email,Strattera

Mine were of the repetitive sort of being chased or driving in a speeding car.  Even in the dream I was aware that my heart was pumping overtime.  And I also wanted to mention that the first 3 weeks to a month I felt it wasn't working_ but I gradually noticed that my life required a whole lot less effort.  That is the biggest change I noticed.  I always got good grades and was successful to a degree_ but with Strattera all of that was easier to achieve.  After weaning myself off and exercising less_ I did gain about 12 pounds and my menstrual cycle was regular.

No appetite.,I started on 10mg and it knocked me for a loop the first 2 days.  Then I had lots of energy and could focus really well.  I finished everything I started and felt motivated to get things done.  Increased to 18mg after 1 week.  It put me on the couch for several days.  Decreased back to 10mg for 1.5 weeks then increased to 25mg. I've been on 25 for a little over a week.  The focus is amazing!  The downside is that I wake up for about 2 hours each night.  I'm wide awake and thinking about what I could be up doing.  I am not tired during the day though.  I also am not hungry.  I have to make myself eat.  I'm drinking a protein shake every day to help with nutrition.  I'm also now taking a multivitamin. For me_ the key has been staying on a low dose for as long as needed before increasing.

IT WAS NOT A STOMACH ACHE! ... as many have written of here. At first it seemed intermittent and unpredictable. Then it became only unpredictable_ but was rapidly becoming daily. How do I know it was Straterra?! Easy. I STOPPED TAKING IT. Voilla! The cramps disappeared and have had not a one since.---I wonder. Could this be an unreported_ unpublished side effect?

Dreams/nightmares every night and I would wake up between 3-4 a.m. and have trouble going back to sleep so I never felt rested. Nausea if not taken with food.,I was recently diagnosed with Adult ADD after researching adhd for my son. My doctor started me on Strattera 25mg/day for the first week. Then 50mg/day for week_ then 75mg/day for 2 weeks_ with a target dosage of 100mg. I only made it up to the 75mg dosage before discontinuing use. When I first started Strattera I was very sleepy this lasted for the first 4-5 days after a dose increase. The sleepiness got much better after that. I was able to actually lie down and go to sleep at night_ something I have never been able to do. I always had too many thoughts bouncing around in my head that I couldn't turn off that would keep me awake sometimes for hours before I could fall asleep. I did notice that during the day my focus was much better and I felt less irritable. Overall I liked the effects I was receiving from the drug_ but the major down side I experience were dreams/nightmares. Before taking Strattera I very seldom had a dream much less a nightmare. When I began taking Strattera I began dreaming every night. I only had a few nightmares but I wasn't sleeping well because of the dreams. I would wake up almost every night between 3-4 a.m. because of my dreams_ then I would have some problems going back to sleep. I never felt rested while on Strattera. This was very disappointing to me because I liked the other results that I was getting from Strattera.

COMMENTS: I don't know how to feel about Strattera. I was diagnosed with Adult ADHD in Fall 2007 and started taking Adderall. Life was fantastic! I was extremely focused AND I was losing weight with no effort. But after about 9 months I didn't feel like I was benefiting from Adderall and I just felt like I was taking a stimulant. I also started to abuse it. My doctor wasn't trying to treat me_ she was writing an Rx (for me and other patients_ as read on her reviews.) I started seeing another doctor. He asked if I was happy with Adderall and I said I guess. He sensed my hesitation and we talked about my other options. We started me on Strattera but I was hesitant. I started at the lowest dose because of my personal hesitation.,"CONTINUED FROM PREVIOUS COLUMN: The results were okay but they've never been better than okay. My doctor and I have altered my dosage but unfortunately_ unlike Adderall_ if you up the dosage it doesn't mean your results will improve. I don't know how else to describe how I feel with Strattera. It's just okay. I felt like the 40mg was too much at once so now I'm on 25mg 3-4 times a day. I used to take 2 in the AM and 2 at lunch_ then 3 in the AM and 1 at lunch_ and now I take 4 in the AM. It doesn't give me that jump start that I need. I've tried taking them at night before but I had horrible nightmares/night tremors. I haven't taken any at night since. It takes me a long time to get going during my day. I usually ""wake up"" and get productive in the late afternoon. I am extremely frustrated and questioning my diagnosis and current therapy. In the past month I moved to a new city and am acting more reclusive and extremely unmotivated to do anything besides sleep_ eat_ pick at my acne and watch tv. Therefore_ I am not looking forward to screening doctors and finding a new good fit here. I feel lost. Sometimes I wonder if it would be okay to go back to Adderall_ especially because I loved the decreased appetite and losing weight without effort. Sometimes I feel like doing that would just be half-assing it. And most of the time I just want to be ""normal_"" whatever that is.",F,29,12  months,11/13/2009Email,Strattera

I begin taking 80mg tomorrow but so far I have seen dramatic results. Although there had been only a slight increase in my attention span_ my other symptoms have improved significantly. I am less prone to irritation and impulsivity and there has also been a profound increase in the the way I feel in general. For once in my life I feel contentment. I no longer feel as though I am crawling under my skin_ and the decrease in my stress / anxiety has been nothing less than miraculous. I have suffered from the effects of ADHD for as long as I remember and this medication is the first that has given me any sort of relief. I cannot begin to describe how thankful I am.,M,32,7  days,6/26/2009,Strattera

203, 3, ADD,None so far_ but I'm sure I will.,If you are comparing this to Adderall_ just forget it. It will not have the same effects. You will not get euphoric_ but if you have an addictive nature to you_ I can tell you Adderall will destroy you. For me_ once I started taking it_ I could not stop. I would stay up for days and not eat. It was the best/worst drug I ever took. After a year of this cycle_ I was so depressed without it_ the only thing that cured my depression was more Adderall. I am still debating whether to allow my doctor to keep it it at the pharmacy as my brain chemistry is so out of whack without it_ I can't function. When it wears off_ I feel intense craving. This means you really can't take it. I have been depressed/unfocused/anxious all my life. When I took it for the first time and felt the effects I thought I had found the cure to all my problems. I was wrong. Like I said_ it was too good to be true. Now_ I am in the depths of the horrid Adderall depression that almost hospitalized me today. Every hospital was full_ so I ended up coming home. Somehow I found a dropped 20 mg pill in the room and instantly the depression lifted. So there was no guessing what was causing it. I swear to God_ I never in my life had depression that deep and lasting. My doctor gave me Strattera months back (different doctor) and I starting taking it today in addition to upping my Prozac to 40 mg. (Yes_ on my own.) I heard Strattera can boost anti-depressants.

I've taken many psychotropic meds over many years_ and this was by far the most difficult initially.  Additionally_ I can't tolerate the constipation without Zelnorm (Tegaserod) which I must buy from India. But eventually it made a huge difference in my life. I could focus_ work without anxiety or distraction_ finish tasks I never could before_ work very long hours.  And moreover_ most symptoms of depression (dysthymia) which occured most of my life almost completely vanished.  True_ I feel a little less excited about things_ slightly a 'don't care' attitude_ but overall my life has vastly improved - in family_ work_ attitude.  Advice: try to get through the initial severe side-effects by taking a low dose_ work with your doctor and websites to find work-arounds for the side-effects if you can until they abate.,M,54,4  years,5/31/2009,Strattera
205, 2, Anxiety_ lack of focus_ adult ADD,Constant nausea_ some dizzyness_ anxious_ insomnia_,Started with 25 mg for dinner and was unable to sleep more than 20 minutes at a time. After 2 nights of this I changed to morning and this helped with the insomnia. I was slightly nauseous for the first week. Day 8 I went up to 25 mg breakfast and 25 mg lunch. I was very nauseous and felt like I had a never ending hangover. The more food I ate before the dose the less the nausea_ however_ there was always some. Still having some insomnia_ waking every 2 hrs. One night I couldn't go to sleep for hours because I had the feeling I wouldn't wake up. I have never felt like that before. I was supposed to go up to 75 mg after 2 weeks_ however_ didn't do it because I wasn't tolerating even the 50 mg. I didn't take any today and felt great. I will not resume and am asking my doctor to let me try Vyvance. I experienced no changes in my ADD habits so it wasn't worth continuing and feeling sick all day.

206, 1, ADD/ADHD,,I had extreme nausea for the 3 weeks that I was taking it. I had to be picked up from school almost every day ( i'm a sophmore in high school. ) I was extremely moody_ mostly towards my boyfriend. While constantly spacing out_ I was having weird thoughts about my relationship with my boyfriend_ ( such as wanting to acuse him of cheating with no evidence or suspisions. ) My doctor told me it would help with my ansomnia_ but it made it alot worse. It got to the point where I barely slept_ so after school i'd come come and sleep until dinner time. I lost contact with all of my friends_ and I just wanted to be alone. I have depression_ and this made it worse. I never was suicidal_ but I was irritable and hated everything. I barely went to the bathroom_ maybe once or twice a day. The thought of eating made me sick. I also have epilepsy and my seizures got worse. On my way to school i'd pass out in the car and fall asleep in class. I needed to be checked for drugs constantly in school because I couldn't keep my head up_ and my pupils would be dialated. I've tried Aderall and a few other drugs for my ADD/ADHD_ and I seem to get almsot the same side effects each time. At about my third week_ I realized that my grades were getting really bad in school. I had an F in every class_ even my favorite one. Mostly because I'd sleep all class_ and I never wanted to answer questions ( part of my irritability. ) It started to hurt while I was having sex_ and I'd get random joint aches all over,F,15,3  weeks,5/20/2009Email,Strattera
207, 5, ADHD,I have taken this medecine for ADHD for a little over 4 years now_ and I have to say to anyone that is just starting to take it_ that it was VERY intense for me when I first started. I experienced unexplainably horrible nightmares_ stomach pains_ vomiting_ and random sweats and flu like symptoms. It was really bad. After talking to my doctor about it_ we experimented with what times of the day I took it_ the dosage ammount_ and different variables to come up with a solution for the horrible side effects. I finally found that I have to take it right before I am going to fall asleep. The drug last 24 hours so you will still get the benefits it provides during the day. You have to make sure you take it right before you fall asleep though_ not too much before because that will start the stomach/heartburn thing up_ and intensify the nightmares sometimes.,Before taking strattera I took adderall and ritalin. Both of these medications gave me terrible mood swings and made me a bitch that no one could tolerate to be around_ so when I experienced strattera_ and was able to concentrate and do well in school_ with out being bitch/nervous wreck_ I had to take it regardless of the side effects. But as I mentioned_ after experimenting and finding out what regimend worked for me I rarely ever experience the side effects_ UNLESS I forget to take it at night and take it in the day.,F,24,4  years,5/19/2009,Strattera

219, 3, Adult ADD,As you see by reading the other comments here_ everyone's body chemistry is unique_ hence the variety of side effects. For me_ the down sides have been an unpleasant_ bone-chilling cold feeling when exercising/sweating (flu-like symptoms)_ some stomach/heartburn/indigestion & constipation issues_ & the worst one - a weird_ unpleasant sexual side effect (ejaculation before orgasm but then no real orgasm follows). Have also occasionally noticed my breathing is unnaturally shallow & a bit rapid. Also_ a bit of a funny body odour that -I- can detect at times_ but I've asked friends - but no one else seems to smell what I do_ so maybe it could be a side effect to the  olfactory nerves?? But no difficulty w/ sleeping_ no anxiety_ no spacing-out_ no irritability so far. Very expensive medication though_ so VERY painful on the wallet!,"I've had the ""day-dreamy"" variety of ADHD all my life_ & have always had difficulty w/ procrastination in starting tasks & w/ focusing on them to completion. Have been on Wellbutrin for 5+ yrs to combat depression over lack of achievement resultant from ADHD. It has helped. Recently prescribed 40mg per day of Strattera to help w/ focus. So far_ (at 2+ weeks and counting) this drug has had some benefits to my concentration_ focus_ task completion. Also_ I feel more patient & tolerant w/ others than usual. But only time will tell if these benefits last &/or will outweigh side- effects in the long term. Everyone is going to react uniquely to medication_ so what you read in all comments here_ both good AND bad_ may or may not occur in quite the same way for you if you are prescribed Strattera.

Also has extreme loss of appetite (very unlike him).,After witnessing what my son is going through on the lowest dose of 10mg/day and reading others comments_ my husband and I have decided to stop this medication immediately. The side effects that I have listed were the ones that we identified and I'm sure there was more discomfort beyond what we were able to see. My son has a high tolerance for pain and discomfort (as is common for people with autism disorders) and is unable to express how he is feeling physically.

241, 4, Adult ADHD/Anxiety,Dry mouth_ very slight constipation. A little nausea (eat before taking it). A little sweaty and tingly at times. All this has reduced as I've upped my dosage weekly. Now at 80 mg which is where my Doc wants me to stay for a while.,Has increased my ability to focus. Big reduction in anxiety level. Better follow through on tasks. Where I used to leave a lot of things half done. I can now get all the way through a task. My wife says overall I'm calmer. I'm less easily agitated while driving_ waiting in lines_ etc. I get distracted from tasks a lot less often. I can catch myself slipping away now before I get completely gone.   I wonder if some of the bad press this stuff gets is Lilly's (the manufacturers) competitors pumping bad info onto the internet to reduce Lilly's sales. I'm delighted with my results. With what I'd read on the internet I was hesitant to put this into my body but now I'm glad I did.The benefit for the few minor side effects is well worth it.,M,48,30  days,12/16/2008Email,Strattera

Also_ I get cold too easily because my body pumps out too much sweat.,Doctor plans on taking me up to 60mg...Very helpful despite side effects,M,17,5  days,12/14/2008,Strattera
243, 1, ADHD,My 15 year old son was put on Strattera for ADHD.  Almost immediatly after starting the drug he began experiencing severe day time fatigue--to the point where he would fall asleep as soon as he got home from school_ wake up for dinner_ then sit on the couch and nod off all night.  When he was awake it was like he was a zombie. However_ at night he would wake up frequently and was unable to fall back asleep. He also suffered from decreased appetite_ which is very unusal for him. I took him back to his Dr. who recommended monitoring him and continuing the meds for 3 more weeks. During the following week the symptoms continued to get worse_ I called the Dr. several times and got no response.  The ultimate side effect came last week when we got a call from his school saying he was suicial. He was so miserable while taking this medication that I would NEVER recommend it to anyone.,The more research I do on this medication the more I find out about the link between teenagers taking it and the side effect of suicide.,M,15, ,12/8/2008Email,Strattera
244, 1, Adult ADHD,flu-like symptoms_ irritability_ constapation_ some trouble urinating_ sexual difficulties_ extreme fatigue in evening,I have suffered moderate ADD symptoms all my life with problems concentrating_ reading_ starting tasks_ impulsiveness and with personal relationships.  I started on Strattera after an ADHD study I was participating in was cancelled.  I gradually built up to 100mg/day taking the full dose in the morning.  The side-effects were present almost from day one and increased in severity along with the dosage.  The flu-like symptoms usually occurred an hour or so after taking the dose and lasted for a couple hours.  I consider myself to have a pretty hardy constitution and have never experienced side-effects like this before.  Still_ as bad as it was_ I may have been willing to live with it if I would have noticed any imnprovement with my ADHD symptoms.  But Strattera did very little for me and certainly no benefit worthy of the longer-term health risks.  I'm still working with the doctor that was conducting the ADHD study.

Sleep was not good until I regained the will to exercise. Increasing the dose after one week did not cause further side effects. Remaining effects are: shallow breathing_ dry mouth_ increased concentration and MUCH less anxiety,My anxiety from the binge eating can overcome the calming effect of strattera_ but it seems easier and in better control. The effect doesn't last all day_ so I ate a lot at night when I was on 25mg.  This became less at 50.,F,23,24  days,11/20/2008,Strattera

This becomes a problem during the workday as there is little opportunity for relief.Like some others I have a disassociation of ejaculation and orgasm but usually by no more than 30 secs. I don't consider it a major problem.,Has worked like a charm for the ADHD. I can work almost whenever I want.

247, 4, Trouble paying attention some times,Very drowsy and dizzy in the morning hours. I don't know if it's lack of sleep. But I sure have to take naps in the late morning hours. Not good. I also have HIGH decrease sexual cravings. My penis also shrinks a lot!! I am also impotent while taking Strattera. Hence when I have sex with my GF_ I usually don't take strattera for that day. I also get dry mouth_ watery mucous dripping from my nose_ occasional constipation (but supplement that by drinking lots of water).But the side affects I hate about strattera is that it shinks my penis_ I can't achieve erection_ no sexual craving_ and I get drowsy in the morning hours.,"The good side of strattera_ compared to Adderall or Ritalin_ is that it's not a narcotic drug. It doesn't palpitate my heart like crazy_ such as what Adderal and Ritalin do to me. hence I quit taking adderal and ritalin_ because it felt like my heart would burst! What I also like about strattera is it seems to help with my asthma problem too. I can run longer distance without panting! I also have ""more energy"" when I go to the gym to lift weights. Strattera also really clears up my nasal congestion compared to Allegra. This is very weird_ but helpful. Lastly_ what I like about Strattera is that it probably balances my brain chemistry_ because I sleep very well the night of the day of taking Strattera.",M,26,4  months,11/19/2008,Strattera

I experienced NO benefits for my ADD whatsoever; in fact_ Strattera seemed to make the ADD brain fog worse *and* exacerbate all my other medical conditions as well.  It's possible this med reacts badly with my other prescriptions (Wellbutrin_ Lunesta_ Amerge)_ although my dr assured me all would be well in that dept.  I had high hopes for Strattera_ since I was told this drug would double as a good anti-depressant; turned out to be just the opposite in my case.

253, 3, Inattentiveness_ Starting Homework,Mood Swings_ Tiredness_ Indigestion_ Trouble Sleeping_ Extreme Anxiety,Went from D-Amphetamine Salt combo to this.  This norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor has a totally different effect than a stimulant.  Concentration is pretty good.  I definitely recommend taking this with an upper.  Caffeine makes this drug 2x more effective and takes away the extreme anxiety and fatigue side effects_ though it raises BP (not worried about that in comaprison to D-Amphetamine Salt Combo).  Watch out for mood swings_ take a mood stabilizer.  My bipolar rapid cycled today_ and I don't want to imagine what it would be like without the mood pills (glutamate inhibitor).  I sleep at weird times...feel tired one moment and hyper the next.  Again_ one more reason to combine it with a stimulant.  Btw_ say hello to heart burn.  Nothing satisfies the burn once you get it_ but it goes away around 10 hours later.

His appetite is great and he sleeps well at night. This drug has some side effects and I worry about long term use but also about what to do when he outgrows this dose.

Many of the side effects are transient_ in that you must give your body time to adjust so I would read the other reviews with reservation that mention they have only taken the pill for a few days.

I keep a bottle of water and hard candy with me all the time to try to subside the drymouth_ but it doesn't seem to work. I already experienced sleeplessness from being on Wellbutrin_ so I am not sure if it is a contributing factor as well.

I don't have the highs and lows_ I can fall asleep at night without a problem_ and I don't blurt out the first thing that comes to my head as much. Overall I am very pleased. The odd sexual side effect does bother me enough that if it doesn't abate I may consider trying something else. I can reach orgasm_ as I always have_ but it is simply not the same.

The doctor put him on Concerta 18mg and after a year boosted him to 27mg. Not recommended_ but I took a weeks worth of his left over 18mg pills. I felt amazing! Then I took a trip to my doctor_ she gave me Strattera. It has been 4 days and this medicine is the exact opposite of what I was expecting.

At first the side effects were urinary hesitancy_ upset stomach_ constipation_and insomnia. All were relatively mild and lessened over time.  His dose has been increased with his growth over the 3 years and he now takes 75 mg per day.  He takes Benadryl at night to help him fall asleep and we include plenty of liquids and fiber in his diet for the constipation.  He takes no other medications. Glad we stuck with it!,This drug has been a miracle for us.  We had tried every other drug and combo out there until we finally found this one.  He is like a different child_ he is fun to be around_ and is doing great in school.

Day two I felt hyper and somewhat positive that maybe the drug would work. However_ I experienced another nite of insomnia and chills/sweats.  Adding to the negative list was thirst and  constipation.  Day 3 and 4  I was tired all the time.  Day 3 I was standing in the kitchen and thought the florescent light was ringing loud_ but when I turned it off I still heard the ringing.

After ejaculation I feel like I have to urinate like a race horse for five minutes_ the same pain you have when you need to go bad! I have involuntary muscle jerks in my feet and hands from time to time_ when falling asleep my whole body sometimes jerks hard once or twice. When these involuntary movements of my feet or hands occur I believe I might also be experiencing something akin to a very short lasting seizure which for a fraction of a second causes a blackout but it is so short and so quick to come and go the symptom is difficult to recognize for what it is because during the event you stop thinking for a few milliseconds_ probably 25-50 ms.,Wish I had this years ago_ I can now split my attention between tasks where before I could only focus on one thing at a time.,M,49,3  months,11/11/2007Email,Strattera

But then his teacher complained about his inattention and he has been back on it for three months. And for three months he has had a skin rash which our doctor said was eczema_ but turns out to be Strattera allergy. I was stupid enough not to read (again) the additional info which comes with the medication and when I did_ I realised what was going on. I don't think the American info mentions the skin rash_ but here in Holland it is included and actually warns to stop taking the medicine the moment something weird happens to your skin. Now we have to wean him off_ which is also bad because he will have mood swings coming off it_ again.,I can only speak from our experience_ I know many people are helped by drugs_ but right now I can't wait to permanently stop medicating my son. The constant itching and scratching made him so depressed that any increase in concentration was counter acted by his physical discomfort.

I asked the pharma guy and he said that that is usual in mixing zoloft and strattera so we cut out the strattera and then she was almost immediately better. Then we started having horrible mornings - this week I forgot to give her the strattera at night so she only got one 18mg does and we have had good mornings but last night I remembered and this morning was a nightmare!

I couldn't win. I snap awake very easily at night and don't seem to sleep well. I started taking it with peanut butter at night (a Strattera drug rep told me this would help nausea and it has- BIG TIME). I also take Melatonin_ a natural supplement that induces sleep and so far so good. My grades in grad school have never been better_ so I am afraid to go off it_ but the side effects can be so bad and so spontaneous that I often think it's not worth it_ especially since my ADD is very mild. There are times when all I want to do is sleep during the day now. I don't know what is going on. I think I got more done when I wasn't on anything.

I started having waves of panic_ profuse sweating_ shortness of breath; in short_ I felt like I was dying.My job involves dealing with the public and there was no one to replace me as I was unable to function.

For the first time I can actually somewhat ""feel"" the passage of time and not be surprised when six hours had past - which often happened before taking the medicine. Strattera also helps me transition to sleep faster_ and I don't ""accidentally stay up all night"" anymore when I remember to take my medication as prescribed. I also process visual information more clearly and have a much easier time while driving_ such as timing a left turn or pulling out into traffic. I never drive without it anymore. It is truly a wonder drug_ except for the constipation... the one thing I could do without. It is still definitely worth it_ though.",F,37,2  years,8/16/2007,Strattera
326, 5, ADHD,At first I felt like I was stoned on pot. However after a few days It was the first time I ever felt what it was like to be normal.,I was very hesitant to try any drugs.  I tried every natural way of combating my ADHD. After struggling with everything I finally said I would try it.  I started with a small dose of 20mg. After about a week I was shocked at how well it worked. I have gone back to school without fear of failure at age 46_ taking classes such as chemistry and calculus_ which I feared as a college student 25 years ago. I don't seem to have much in the way of side effects_ and I am going to increase my dosage to 40mg a day.I have also found it works well taken twice a day as opposed to once a day.  Strattera has changed my life_ I am so grateful,F,46,1  years,8/10/2007Email,Strattera

They went away with time and their effects on my blood tests were enough for me to tolarate anything. I plan to keep on taking this drug if it will make me better. But as with The AIDS meds_ a few were adjusted so I will be open to a new ADD drug if needed. I will post my side effects weekly and what I do for their ease as I am researching my old info for good remedies. Living with AIDS for 21 years and strong!,M,45,8  days,7/25/2007Email,Strattera

329, 2, ADD,Loss of appetite_ incredible mood swings_ lowered self-esteem_ problems falling asleep.,My son started to take Strattera because his grades were dropping from lack of concentration.

330, 5, ADHD,"We are giving our 10-yr-old son Strattera for ADHD. When he first started on it_ and when we increased the dose (from 10mg_ to 20mg_ to 30mg_ to 40mg)_ we noticed lethargy the first day_ then ""disinhibition"" of angry impulses the second day (and sometimes the third). Meaning_ he had a very short fuse_ was easily upset_ and acted out with hitting_ throwing_ etc. Very alarming! But we continued with it_ and see only benefits now. (He is now sleepy at bedtime -- a huge benefit!)","We started our son on Strattera because while Ritalin had worked very well_ he had a tendency toward tics_ and around his 10th b-day he developed a very stubborn ""nodding"" tic. Unlike in the past_ this time he felt very self-conscious about the tic and would cry at night. So a non-stimulant seemed like a good option. Also helpful that S. can treat anxiety_ which is another minor problem for our son. When we saw this anger and aggression_ we were very alarmed_ and what I read on sites like this made us reconsider whether this was a good idea. In discussion with his psychiatrist_ we agreed to give the med a few more weeks_ so that he could get to full saturation and the full dose_ and then decide. My h and I both take psych meds ourselves and are familiar with how side effects often diminish over time. Now our son has been on 40mg for a week (total 6 weeks on S) and the overall effect is very good. He is more patient_ more cooperative_ more focused_ and generally more pleasant",M,10,45  days,7/14/2007,Strattera
331, 4, ADD,temporary side effects: 1st day-- mania; 1st month-- decreased appetite.   Longer term: dry mouth; involuntary urination made me decrease coffee from 6-8 cups a day to 2.  Also decreased libido.,Increased mental clarity and focus.  Still have the challenge of getting things done.  When I've tried stopping dosage for half a week I caught myself doing the pre-ADD dumb stuff that didn't make any sense or tended to sabotage my day.   Presently complementing my strattera dose with brain chemicals: gingko biloba_ ginseng_ acetyl L-carnitine_ phosphotidylserine_ fish oil capsules_ and herbal formulas.  With no added side effects.  Of all these_ probably fish oil makes the biggest difference for brain/heart health.,M,48,3  years,7/14/2007Email,Strattera

Like a raging bull in a bullpen full of heifers. Feel almost 100 percent myself again. Still kind of unmotivated to do a whole lot. And the focus problems I'd say are worse then before I started the med. Like my body got used to the med focusing for me_ and got lazy. I'm sure in another couple weeks or so I'll be good as new. No panic attacks though! Prob the best part. I've been dealing with them for almost two years now. But no more. Off strattera and lovin it!!,M,23,5  months,7/12/2007,Strattera

I took it 2 more times to make sure it was the medicine_ and each time I took it_ I got very sick. I can't tell you if it helps with ADD. I didn't get that far. Each time I took it_ I was in bed all day sick. It might have been an allergic reaction_ but I'm not sure. Just want to give everyone a warning to BE CAREFUL!

We started looking for the right medicine when he was three and now at five yrs of age have found it. Sleeps through the night again_ he can think before doing_ listens_ isn't as antsy. He is currnetly on 18mg_ it does take the full 4 to 6 weeks to take a full effect_ but after just 2 weeks we noticed a huge improvement and it's only been getting better--for all of us.

336, 2, ADHD,Sexual side effects were terrible. No libido. Pre-orgasm ejaculation. Worst of the worse was about a three week period after I missed two days. Thought I was going absolutely nuts. Called out from work all three weeks. Depressed_ strong feeling of depersonalization/derealization. I don't cry_ but broke down sobbing because I thought I was going to be that way forever. Considered committing myself to a mental institution. Odd feeling throughout course of taking medicine.,Definitely improved my ability to focus. My job requires great attention to detail. Initial complaint was that I kept making mistakes on the job_ prescribed strattera for it. Improved job performance_ just couldn't handle the side effects.,M,23,5  months,7/7/2007,Strattera

Sweating was terrible_ especially along with the chills. Like I had the flu all the time or something. The sexual side effects were terrible. Ejaculation before orgasm_ like 30 seconds before. If I was even aroused. Libido had a significant decrease. I'm 23_ I should want to sleep with everything that walks! Frustration has been my girlfriends middle name for the last few months. Mood swings_ very irritable.,The worst thing of all was when i missed a couple doses. I was sent into a terrible world of panic. I was dead convinced I was going crazy. Derealization_depersonalization is the best way to describe what I felt. Called out sick to work for two weeks before my body (and head) adjusted back to the medication. I don't take any other medication_ and I don't do drugs or drink alcohol. I hate strattera with a passion. I've been weening off of it for two weeks_ I have 5 25mg doses left to take before I'm done.

I took it because I was sick of the restrictions on ritalin. I liked that it could be phoned in_ refilled_ etc. This drug made me feel somewhat stoned and disconnected. In a way it made my ADD symptoms worse. I was never very hyperactive_ but am the highly distractable scatterbrain daydreamy ADDer. I didn't stop when I knew it wasn't working because the drug gave me some euphoria. It wasn't until I got burned by some bad decisions and consequences that I stopped taking the drug. Withdrawal was not a problem and I didn't crave it later. I'm still paying for the poor decisions I made under its influence and have no doubt that it distorted my judgement.

374, 3, adhd/depression,hot flashes_ chills_ nausea_,This med does help me focus_ BUT all the FLU SYMPTOMS are tough to take.  this is my 2nd time on strattera.  started out on 25mg and had to quit. this time on 10mg and as i type_ im having hot flashes and the goosebumps.  doc is hesitant to prescribe adderall because i was addicted to pain killers and got in some trouble.  guess i'll try and tough it out. excuse me while i wipe the sweat beads off my head.,M,26,4  days,11/29/2006,Strattera
375, 1, adult adhd,throwing up_ jittery_ mad_ annoyed_ hot flashes_ severe stomach ache_ confusion_ decreased attention span_ goose bumps_ sweating.,THIS IS THE WORST DRUG EVER! do not take it! I'm warning you! If you wanna feel like shit for the better half of the day_ then take it. Does not help with concentration. Makes me soooo annoyed and irritable. Adderall seems to be the best way to go with medication for adhd. Also... non stimulant? thats the ONLY good thing about this shit.,F,19,2  days,11/23/2006,Strattera
376, 1, ADD,chills and goosebunps_ tingling up and down arms and head_ then hot flashes.  within a half hour taking the medication a terrible hyper_ crazy feeling like I was going to crawl out of my skin. That would lessen after a few hours.  Sudden high blood pressure.  Extremly upset stomach and abdominal cramps. Angry rageful feelings although I'm usually very even tempered. Sudden sleepiness_ needing naps then jumping awake with my heart pounding like a bomb had just gone off,I did notice a slight increase in concentration about 3 to 4 hours after taking the drug after some of the terrible side affects would abate. I was on 60mgs/1xday.,F,38,10  days,11/20/2006,Strattera
377, 5, ADD,_ mind racing_ trouble sleeping_ depression(WHEN COMBINED with atypical antipsychotics_ or Remeron)_,"COMBINING STRATTERA WITH OTHER PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS WILL MAKE YOU DEPRESSED!!! when i first started taking strattera i was also taking zoloft 100 mg_ but couldn""t concentrate_ after a few weeks i decided i hated this combination because i was haveing alot of social anxiety and moodswings and trouble making friends_ after about a moutnth i quit the zoloft and started only strattera_ at 160lbs my concentrating and grades did improve after being stabilized on 65mg daily_ i became convinced i was skitzophrenic because i was so nervous so my doctor perscribed me 40mg geodon daily(this sent me into a dark miserable mindracing panic attack depression_ then i swiched to risperdal and nearly the same was tru for this combo_ now im taking remeron and stratter and it is hard for me to talk to people. thus i conclude Dont Combine Strattera with Zoloft_ risperdal_ geodon_ or Remeron  (i Was holpitilized all the events except the current occured)",M,17,4  months,11/18/2006,Strattera

379, 4, Adult ADHD,Snapping awake suddenly_ needing naps all day_ flu symptoms_ nausea_ FARTING OMG_ turning into a bitch if I miss a dose_ depression_ bad periods,It doesn't help focus as well as stimulants_ but it DOES keep me from being very hyper--like a leash on a yippy dog.  So much so that I needed to get zoloft to combat the depression it was causing.  I like it better than Adderall and the others_ but the side effects are terrible.,F,37,3  months,10/19/2006,Strattera
380, 5, ADHD,Frequent urination for first month_ drowsiness (a plus when taken at bedtime)_ decreased appetite ( has lost 2 pounds in 2 months),My 5-year old son went on Strattera after Adderall was discontinued due to severe mood swings when it wore off.  The Strattera is very helpful in curbing impulsivity and increasing concentration. The social anxiety has also all but disappeared on this drug. My son is still the same happy_ energetic boy. His ADHD is still present but the Strattera has lessened the symptoms by 50% or so. He is sleeping full nights and rested in the morning.  We will continue this drug indefinitely and hope that it continues to work well.,M,5,9  weeks,10/3/2006Email,Strattera
381, 1, adhd,nausea_ depression_ tingling chills that ran down my head and legs.,I HATE THIS DRUG!!! I became the black box warning within hours of taking it.  It was like a bad acid trip that wouldn't wear off.  It also introduced thoughts of killing myself which were never there before.  It took weeks before it's affects wore off and some are still here.  I would sue them if it were possible.,F,35,4  days,10/2/2006,Strattera

I have an open relationship with my boss and let him know I was taking it.  He said he's noticed a differance_ as has my wife.  As for me_ much easier to focus.,M,40,4  weeks,9/14/2006,Strattera
383, 4, Adult ADD,"Ejaculation BEFORE orgasm.. Thats not normal for a male.. and i couldnt tell i was ejaculating.. The orgasm comes 10 to 30 seconds later.. Its a good thing my girlfriend uses birth control. It would be very unwise to use the ""pull out"" method during intercourse if you are a male and on this medicine.  Also_ I already have insomnia and this medicine causes ""short"" sleeping  periods. I could only stay asleep for 2 or 3 hours and would suddenly ""snap"" to complete awakeness all at once. The most sleep I averaged on this medication was 5 hours (which was a good nights sleep while on this medication) It did however work dramatically good for helping me with ADD.. But the side effects are risky or over-whelming.. I was very tired from little to no sleep.. The worst thing isnt even related the medication itself. It is extremely expensive and most insurance companies are un-educated to this medication and therefore wont cover it because of so-called alternatives.",,M,35,9  days,9/13/2006,Strattera
384, 1, Adult ADD,Drowsiness_ mood swings_ made me drowsy and stupid.  I didnt have to take it for very long to see that the results didnt justify the costs...,Coming off this thing is a nightmare.. I'm getting severe brain zaps and nausea_ this drug is the devil.... innefective and terribly hard to come off of...,M,28,20  days,9/13/2006,Strattera
385, 2, ADD,I was told the side effects would only last a week or so_ but after 3 weeks_ I continued getting the dry mouth_ dizziness (which actually felt more like I was just plain loopy and decidedly UNfocused)_ and the one side effect I liked was the decreased appetite. I've lost a some weight in the short time I've been taking this drug.,I was on the lowest dose (25mg) with instructions to increase to 50 after 1 week. I told the pdoc I wouldn't increase until I worked out the side effects. Unfortunately_ they only decreased slightly_ and never fully went away. What benefit I felt was small_ and not worth the problems. I have friends who take the drug and rave about it_ but I did not get any benefit_ and in recommending it will add this caveat.,F,43,3  weeks,8/27/2006Email,Strattera
