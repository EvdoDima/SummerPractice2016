4, 3, Lack of focus,Somnolence_ fatigue_ slight headaches_ slight tremor,Started Strattera to combat the racing thoughts and inattentiveness due to Bipolar 2 disorder. Not sure if I'm also ADD but I cannot keep my mind focused_ my thoughts just seems to bounce from one to another. I can walk into a room and forget why I'm there. So far_ the tiredness is really affecting my productivity. I'm unmotivated to do anything except veg out on the sofa. Just to note I'm also on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg_ Latuda 20 mg_ and lamotrigine 100 mg. I take all the meds in the morning except the latuda which I take before bed. Hopefully things get better soon.Update: 7/24/16 After taking Strattera for about 2.5 months at 40 mg a day I am still torn on its effectiveness. Initially after about 4-5 weeks I had an couple days of complete focus and follow through. I was able to organize my home_ get rid of a pile of old papers and mail I had been procrastinating on going through_ and overall felt like I was able to complete a task before moving on to the next. I was excited! Unfortunately_ those effects didn't last long but my psyc kept me at that dose for another month and a half. I am now on my 2nd day at 60 mg. I'm not sure if I feel much of a difference at this point but I think I feel a little more jittery but just slightly. I do have an essential tremor so maybe that is what's going on. I am having an increase in being so exhausted that I have to take 1-2 hour nap. Sudden dizziness that only lasts a few seconds and slight headaches occur occasionally.,F,35,3  months60mg 1X D,7/24/2016EmailHistory,Strattera

6, 5, ADHD,Nausea is the #1 side effect for me and then_ the strange dreams.  The sleepiness is strong the first month.,After_ the sleepiness wouldn't go away_ I switched the time I take it.  I take it early evening around 6/7pm. I don't have sleepiness during the day. The nausea is for a little bit after I take it_ then it fades.  I used to have a voracious sex drive but now it's normal. I would eat a large steak dinner with all the trimmings and be hungry in 2hrs. But now_ I eat normal and I don't think about eating all the time.  I don't have the temper I used to have and I can plan normal and concentrate on one thing at a time as well as multi-task appropriately. I know this must sound like a commercial_ but_ I worked on one thing at a time.  Strattera has a great behavior modification med for me.  As the behaviors changed the anxiety reduced_ the temper reduced_ the concentration improved because I didn't have as much on my mind from the anxiety.  I have gone off of it sometimes over the years...due to annoyance with the nausea or if I had to work nights for a short period.  Couldn't do that long term because the lack of concentration.  But overall_ It has worked for me. It will not fix it all at once and be careful mixing it with other ADD/ADHD meds and especially anti-depressants.  Remember_ this med REGULATES. It will demand normal sleep patterns and eating patterns.  Also_ exercise helps with energy.  Energy makes energy.  Whatever exercise your doctor approves...walking or something makes this med seem like a wonder drug.,F,45,12  years40 mg 1X D,6/23/2016,Strattera
7, 3, Forgetfulness_ losing things_ Impat,Impotence and other sexual side effects.,Didn't notice much of anything at first as expected. It doesn't seem to be a miracle drug that works quickly or completely removes all symptoms_ but I'm still going to give it a lot more time to make a final judgement. I have noticed that I am a bit more calm and react less extreme to upsetting things_ but I'm still a bit forgetful and impatient. It seems to be helping my anxiety better than my adhd. I think if I don't notice anything after about two months I will try something new. The only reason I'm not taking concerta which has worked in the past is that my insurance won't cover it for whatever reason. I do feel strongly that this medicine has a lot of potential though as I already feel a little more calm. I also feel a bit more in control of where I put my attention.,M,23,3  weeks40 MG 1 a,6/8/2016Email,Strattera
8, 4, ADD_ Anxiety,NauseaTiredWeird Sleep,Been on and off for many years. When I start_ I feel like I have the flu. Exhausted_ tingly_ weird dreams. Almost drunk feeling! After a week or so I feel better and side effects disappear slowly. 3 months into 40mg I have no side effects but the effectiveness isn't as good. Now I'm at 80mg_ took it at night and slept so light...felt very awake and had vivid dreams. Taking it in the morning and I'm so nauseous! But it's worth it when the side effects wear off. Doesn't give me the kick like stimulants but once I start on something I can focus and am not easily distracted. Extra thoughts are more streamlined too. Less anxiety because of this! My brain functions almost simpler? It's nice.,F,30,3  days40-80mg,5/24/2016Email,Strattera

10, 5, ADHD/ADD,The most insane INITIAL side effects I've ever had starting a medication. Dizziness and nausea mostly. The first two days were the worst_ it felt like I was drunk. After 1 week everything was fine and normal.

11, 2, ADD,Started at 40 mg once per day.  Extreme dry mouth_ in a daze_ feeling very confused and SO tired.  Eyes felt buggy and unable to normally regain focus between objects (like_ from looking at someone talking_ then look at my phone_ it was all blurry for a minute).  Not confirmed_ but I think it may have raised my BP and heartrate.  I called the doc_ they dropped me to 18 mg.  Symptoms all the same but much less.  I am on day 4 of 18mg.  Feeling a little loopy_ a little bit of dry mouth_ and feel wired.  Coffee makes it worse. My sleep has been terrible - sleeping very lightly every night_ never seeming to get into deep sleep_ yet when I wake up in the morning_ I am WIDE AWAKE.  No nausea_ no stomach issues.,Going to stick this out for another week or so.  I am also on 300mg Bupropion for anxiety.  Doc said that a stimulant would make my anxiety worse so he prescribed Strattera.  I'm thinking I'd rather test that theory and deal with a day of anixiety then these persistent weird symptoms and inability to sleep....,F,40,2  days40mg 1X D,3/29/2016Email,Strattera

Though depression and racing thoughts persist.

Soon! I am going to have words with her.Though_ I now have a developing self confidence and an actual social presence at work and with friends_ social media has been the bane of my existence.

13, 5, ADHD,A small amount of nausea_ first two days on Straterra I was sleepy. The longer I was on it_ the more increased energy. Strange dreams.,I love straterra. I am able to focus_ stay on task and can pay attention. It seems the longer I've been on it_ the better.  After a while the side effects subside.  It also calms my nervous twitches. I feel that this is a steady_ level fix. (Adderall was a spur of the moment fix with agitation side effects) I am completely happy with this medication.,F,37,3  months80mg,3/21/2016,Strattera
14, 3, ADHD,Nausea_ extreme sweating_ extremely heat intolerant_ migraine auras (no headache)_ exercise intolerance-short of breath with any exertion_,I am very disappointed because this medication was helping me concentrate. It was added to my other medications because I couldn't concentrate after interning during the day and I'm in grad school. The heat...I can't explain how uncomfortable and bad it feels. I just took my temperature and either this new Walgreens thermometer is broken or something is wrong. It read 94.5 degrees F. I tried oral and under my arm. I had to take my coat off outside because I was dripping with sweat and exhausted. It was 30 degrees out. The nausea did not start until about 5 or more days of taking 80 mg after the typical sample pack titration.  My doc think nausea starts right away if you get that side effect; for me it started after a week on 80 mg. I don't know what else I can do but to go off; ASAP. I feel like a trip to immediate care is around the corner if I keep taking this. the positive effect of this medication is that there is no speedy feeling or vacillating ability to concentrate. It's very steady but the focus gets lost under the blanket of heat and sweat I experience.  I think I will try exercise.  I read an article about a student with ADHD who raced his bicycle and did not need adhd meds. The training and exercise helped him focus. I hope it works. Generally_ after the heat dissipates and the nausea subsides_  it's time to go to bed; like right now. Then_ I get up and try again_ thinking it was my imagination.,F,60,45  days80 MG 1X D,3/20/2016Email,Strattera

18, 5, Adult ADHD-PI,At 40mg: Nausea_ headache_ insomnia. At 80mg: Vomiting_ nausea_ headache_ fatigue_ urinary hesitation_ abnormal dreams. All resolved in 3 weeks at 80mg.,It's a shame to see comments from other patients that say they're giving up on Strattera after one or two weeks. I had a VERY rough time at first_ but was determined to stick with it and I'm extremely happy with the results. Initially the nausea was so bad I had to sit still and close my eyes to keep from vomiting. For a few days it was hard to urinate. The fatigue was so strong at one point I basically spent three days in bed. After two weeks at 80 mg_ I felt like crap_ and my symptoms hadn't improved. But I knew that I had to stay on it for longer to see how it would affect me long term. Oh boy_ am I glad that I did! Before Strattera_ I would find it near impossible to start a task. Once I did start_ I'd easily become distracted by my own thoughts. I had problems with losing focus_ even if people were speaking to me directly.Life on Strattera is better. I don't 'feel' it working - now that the side effects are gone_ I don't 'feel' anything when I take it. But I know it's working because it's helping my symptoms. I can now focus for about the same length of time as someone without ADHD. I no longer have entire days lost to procrastination.Of course sometimes_ I still procrastinate. I can still lose focus during a conversation if I'm not careful. But now it feels like most of my symptoms can be overcome most of the time with enough willpower. That was impossible before. Don't let initial side effects put you off!,M,27,8  weeks80 mg 1X D,12/16/2015,Strattera
19, 5, Non-stimulant ADHD medication,Dry mouth_ occasional night sweats_ occasional slight anxiety but nothing unmanageable,I love Strattera. I've been on it three different times (going on and off of it for various reasons) and each time it really doesn't start working for about a month or a month and a half_ so you really have to give it time to build up in your system. It's very different from a stimulant in that way. The reason I started Strattera the first time was after failed use of Vyvanse and Ritalin. They made me jittery and extremely anxious (I had previously been diagnosed with anxiety_ so it makes sense that a stimulant would make my anxiety worse.) I also found that at the end of the day_ I could not focus anymore. It was as if I had never taken it. This was really upsetting to me because_ being a college student_ I needed to be focused all of the time and that just wasn't happening. Strattera has been my miracle drug. Nothing else has helped me like this has. I honestly would have dropped out of college if it weren't for Strattera. I can't say enough good things about it. I would definitely recommend taking a chance with Strattera. Give it time and it will change your life.,F,19,2  months40 mg,11/25/2015,Strattera

22, 4, ADD,Initially increased energy levels and noticeable increase in focus especially in the gym.  Strange and irritating side effect was increased susceptibility to cold after sweating that would result in me getting the chills and becoming nauseated.  Constipation and lack of urine pressure were other minor side effects.  Even when I try to force urine out faster I can't seem to be able to_ just a slow steady stream that doesn't always seem to get it all out. These side effects seem to be wearing off.  Currently the main side effect is highly increased sex drive.,I feel like I can stay on task for a longer period of time but does not necessarily increase my focus in general.  I also had a history of depression and anti social behavior but am starting to notice a general level of contentment and a desire to be more social.  By reading the other reviews on this site_ it seems like the symptoms may continue to develop and evolve for months so I plan to stay at my current dosage for a while to continue to monitor how my body reacts.,M,32,1  months100 mg,10/4/2015,Strattera

28, 1, ADHD,My son was placed on Strattera when he was 10 yrs old_ when it was 1st approved by FDA in Jan 2003. After 3 miserable week's with no help with ADHD & him crying_ raging_ suicidal his Pediatrician put him back on 10 to 15 MG of Adderall per day & he calmed down & was able to focus again. Right after my son's terrible experience with Strattera_ my oldest son's Band Teacher confided in me that he also had ADHD & had an appointment with his Dr. to begin treatment with Stattera_ I told him about our experience & to be careful. Within 4 week's of starting treatment our H.S.Band teacher had a complete nervous breakdown_ was suicidal & hosptilized. He was in therapy for a very long time & was not able to continue as Band Teacher. It took over a year for him to start giving private lessons_ it was devastating for him & my son. I don't recommend it unless you are supervised by Dr. constantly. It almost ended my son's life & wrecked my friend's life. He was lucky to have lived & his wife_ children_ career_ finances were all severely jeopardized by Strattera.,I'm suprized to see that Stattera is still being used for ADHD along with depression. I'm stunned to see all of these comment's_ I had no idea that it caused impotance_ as well as severe depression. I would strongly caution to any parent or adult to be very careful with this medication. It is definitely dependent on each person's own chemical makeup. I read some people had good responses_ and I'm grateful they did not have the nightmare experience that my son & my friend_ our son's Band Teacher had. That was a horrific year I'll never forget.,M,10,3  weeks25 mg,8/9/2015,Strattera

If you decide to go this route_ be prepared for the possibility(depending on your body; some people handle it better. titrating up that is; down is a SOB.

In addition_ I started noticing 2 wks ago that I just felt meh_ not myself and that I was having trouble focusing; my ability to retain information is minimal at best.  Being a graduate student in med school this is NOT a welcome side effect!   I am just a hot mess most of the time recently.  I started keeping track of how I felt over the last two weeks and I was shocked how much I had been feeling depressed_ lethargic- constantly crying.,While it may work for others_ this was not the drug for me.

I get ongoing hot/cold flushes after the acute side effects wear off_ for the first few hours after taking maybe 3 or 4 hours.,"It doesn't seem to matter how much I eat or drink before_ during or after taking Strattera.

Feeling great_ otherwise!,This stuff has worked wonders for me.  Seriously_ life-changing.  I don't feel so lost/confused/anxious/worried all the time.  When something needs to be done_ holy crap_ I ACTUALLY DO IT!  I'm not as distracted by stimulation (sights_ sounds_ smells_ etc).  I can do tasks in sequential order.  My mind is not being controlled by a freaking monkey anymore.  I can't believe how well this works for my Inattentive-type ADD.  The best part is I don't feel like anything about me has changed - my personality is exactly the same_ except that I am productive and can listen to conversations without zoning out after 2 seconds.  I am less impulsive too; my brain is not constantly interrupting my life anymore.    I am surprised to read all of the crazy side effects as I really don't have any of them_ except for vivid dreams and I feel weird if I take it in the morning without eating.  I can literally feel it start to kick in about 45 minutes after I take it_ and it usually starts wearing off around 8pm.  It's supposed to be 24-hour coverage_ I think it sticks around in your system but I can definitely feel it when it is wearing off.,F,33,25  days80mg 1X D,2/16/2015Email,Strattera

Every patient will react differently.I would recommend medical marihuana for artistic sort of jobs.,M,25,3  weeks80 MG,12/27/2014Email,Strattera
44, 5, exploring adult ADD,Sweating profusely_ minor headaches_ nausea_ Dry mouth_,Today I started my 80mg and I have not had any of the side effects yet. I almost quit because the nausea. But decided to do a little bit of research and to give it a try for a little bit longer as it is a build up drug.

45, 2, ADHD,I have just started taking this medication prescribed by a NHS psychiatrist_ I was previously taking 36mg of slow release Concerta but was suffering from palpitations and increased heart rate. Day one: extreme raynauds disease symptoms in my toes (I have raynauds but have not had an attack this severe ever_ had to stand in bath for 30 mins to feel my feet again). Day two another severe raynauds attack and I had a small glass of red wine and suffered tingling in my jaw and extreme redness and hot flush feeling my face almost feels like my face is swollen (I asked the psychiatrist if I could drink socially on this drug and he said it was ok as long as not heavy drinking),Im going to continue taking this drug for upto a month and see how it goes as I understand this is a build up drug but think I may go back to concerta if Raynauds side effect continues,M,29,2  days40MG 1X D,12/12/2014Email,Strattera
46, 5, ADHD (comorbid w/ bipolar disorder),sleepiness (first week)_ vomiting_ extreme nausea (first week)_ loss of appetite_ weight loss,Of all the meds I've tried_ Strattera was the hardest to get used to. The first week and a half was really rough and I nearly threw in the towel a few times. But was it ever worth it! After my bipolar was under my control I noticed other symptoms that were hidden behind bipolar. I was diagnosed with ADHD. I didn't know how bad my ADHD was until Strattera took away the complications of the disorder! I feel more focused_ and calm then I have in years.The nausea (worst I ever had) and vomiting stopped after the first two weeks or so. So did the sleepiness. Now I feel alive and happy again. Colors are litterally brighter and I am able to drive again without getting distracted. I still have no appetite and no longer crave my comfort foods. Eating was my version of fidgetting. I have lost 7.3 pounds since the first of November but I also had lots to lose and have drastically changed my eating habits since starting the pill. I am finally remembering to take my bipolar meds too! Fantastic medication - if you can get through the adjustment period!,F,26,18  days40mg 1X D,11/17/2014,Strattera

48, 1, ADHD Inattentive Type,Crabbiness_ Irritability_ Hostile_ OD on sleeping pills on first (and only day) of 40 mg dose. Hospitalization in Adolescent Mental Heath Unit for 3 days.,"My 16 year old son started taking this med to help with his ADD. He was on it for 27 days at 25mg. HE didn't think it was working and had scheduled a visit with hs doctor. He stopped taking it for three days before the doctor visit. This ""break"" was not planned but ended up being helpful in the end. He was NICE during the three day break. Acting silly_ laughing_ being sociable. HE had been an anti-social crab the month of the drug. The doc upped his dose to 40mg. A few hours after his first 40 mg dose_ he snapped at me and was unusually crabby. I immediately put 2 and 2 together. The niceness of the previous three says and the instant crabbiness when he got on the increased dose. Later that day he over dosed on sleeping pills. He swears he was ""just trying to sleep"" but.... He ended up in hospital for three days. Now he's medication free and back to his normal self. I call this the ""^^^hole drug"". I think it made him so irritated that he couldn't stand to be in his own skin that day. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! Scary scary stuff!",M,16,27  days25mg 1X D,11/8/2014,Strattera

51, 1, ADD,I've been taking strattera since I was in sixth grade. It's always given me side effects and always makes me feel really down. I have the most trouble with:Nausea_ headaches_ complete lack of energy_ lack of sexual interest and ability_ and hot flashes. At least once a month I have to leave school early because it makes me feel terribly sick.,,M,17,6  years80 mg,8/29/2014,Strattera
52, 1, adhd,Scary to say the least. This was my first medication for adhd. I did not want to take a stim. The first week extreme nausa . My sleep was weird like i could hear the tv and comprehend everything. The 2nd and 3 rd week i would get angry at a drop of a hat. I literally wanted to unzip myself out my skin. The docotor pushed for me to stay on. The fourth week was the final straw. I was in a haze_ almost like i wasent in body. I got in a minor tiff with my bf and went in my house and punched a plate. Thank god i didnt take ny dose that night...the next morning i was irratable but not in haze. I realized that this wasent me . Told the doxotor to take both bottles back. Thank god i quit . I honestly think i would have gone full blown psychotic... i kid you not the last week i took it i felt like i lost control of my body and thoughts.,,F,21,4  weeks30,8/21/2014Email,Strattera

54, 5, ADHD,Decrease in appetite and some tiredness,I started with Strattera as the first ADHD medication I have taken because I could not take stimulants due to side effects. I was VERY worried about the side effects of the drug as I had a bad reaction to an antidepressant a few years ago.  So far I have had no major side effects_ no nausea_ no stomach pain_ nothing except some appetite loss and tiredness.  I can think_ concentrate_ and get work done though.,F,27,2  days40 MG 1X D,6/29/2014,Strattera

56, 5, ADHD,for first month or so mostly sleep issues_ trouble getting to sleep_ increased heart rate_ dizzyness.,Strattera has changed my life_ I struggled all my life through school. This drug has allowed me to be able to get to sleep at night instead of having my mind race. Be able to read more than a page in a book without starting to daydream and forget what im reading. People say that I'm more organized with my storys instead of going off in tangents. I don't like the feeling of being on drugs and with Adderall and Ridilin you feel like a drug is forcing you to concentrate. Strattera isnt going to make you do anything_ it just seems to allow you to focus more and have more clarity.,F,31,9  years80ml 1X D,5/17/2014,Strattera
57, 2, ADHD,Increased appetite!! Weight gain! Extremely moody_ easily angered_ easily irritated_ & acts like he doesn't have a care in this world. Acts very irrational & sometimes psychotic. He doesn't seem to have a grip on reality.,My son was on Concerta for 3 years & done great. He was maxed out with his growth spurts & dosage & it stopped working as well. Adderall made him very violent & now strattera seems to be doing that as well. We were trying to do non-stimulants but it just isn't working. I'm torn & not sure what to do. My son used to be very compassionate & loving. He liked to be funny_ he loved to laugh & had a big personality but was unable to focus & finish tasks even in structured environments. Now my son is not himself & no one can handle him the way he currently is. He started on 20mg of straterra & has increased each month by 20 mg. each month the side effects become worse. His dr says we must give it time & refuses to take him off. I'm in search of a new dr. Please beware.  I thought the monthly increase was going to help him & he is worse than ever.,M,12,3  months80mg 1X D,12/25/2013,Strattera
