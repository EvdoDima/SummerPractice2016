1, 1, Toenail fungus,Extremely high morning blood pressure,I took this drug 2xd for one week_ for three consecutive months.  Immediately after the last dose_ I woke every morning at 5 AM with excruitating headaches.  Finally thought to take blood pressure - 159.  My normal blood pressure has always been under 120 when active_ under 100 when sitting.  Three months later I still have this high morning blood pressure_ the kind that causes strokes/heart attacks in bed.  NOT WORTH IT.   There is a brand new med for antifungal that is more effective with no side effects.  Ask your doctor.,F,65,  2X D,12/3/2015,Sporanox

8, 5, sporotrichosis back of hand,possible fatigue,looked well enough that I could remove bandage covering lesion after 2 mos. Every MD that looks at it  says- yeah its good.  Since it is still red and does not look great I could be happier but the experts agree - its been killed - the fungus. and the red is just the healing process. I've got 15 more pills which I will take - Dr Kazanjian said - lets do 3 months OK?  so aside from I seem a tad more fatigued I'll happily do it,M,56,75  days100 1X D,5/13/2013,Sporanox
9, 2, Histoplasmosis of Brain,Do not know where to begin...Is my father who is taking it and has gotten CHF while on it_ one of my biggest issues is that it has NOT helped the 19 lesions on his brain and the fact that he can not take medications he needs to treat other things like his A-FIB and COPD,He must be on the medicine for life as they say due to the fact the lesions on his brain have not gone away in a year and a half.  So many other medical problems have showed up since the beginning of the sporanox_ he now has COPD_ A-FIB_ CHF_ seizures_ and can do much of nothing for these issues since the meds to treat them reacts with the sporanox as do most medicines.  The only good thing I CAN say about the medicine is that my father would be dead without it.

10, 5, SPOROTRICHOSIS,none,worried about possible side affects based primarily on what I read here at this site. So far_ knock on wood_ nothing. Inflamation was reduced within 5 days. big relief. Today_ or this evening_ just now_  took off bandage and it looked so much better. no pus- for the first time.  To my relief_ the Doctor_ an infectious disease specialist at the Taubman Center here in Ann Arbor_ said ' this drug is safe for you - you have no other health issues or underlying risk factors - this ought to work. He appeared quite confident and so far it seems he was right.  I bought at Costco - 30 tablets for $193. if memory is correct_ will need to stay on daily 100 mg dose for at least two months.,M,56,10  days100 mg 1X D,3/9/2013,Sporanox
11, 4, Blastomycosis,At first I couldn't keep it down so I started drinking coca cola 15 minutes before taking it. After a couple of weeks I realized that I could keep it dow n without coca cola so I stopped drinking coca cola(I'm not a fan of pop) BUT after that my ankle and eyes started swelling!

I took it for 2 DAYS over 10 years ago and I am STILL NOT THE SAME.  Literally overnight after taking this medication I developed serious anxiety and depression and mental confusion.

Looking forward to feeling better...If anyone has any advice_ I would appreciate hearing from you.,Found it seemed to do some good for the purpose it was prescribed (it made the itchy spots on my back not itch anymore and hopefully it killed the fungus) which was important b/c I am trying to get pregnant and apparently the fungus is not great for the baby and that is why I went on the med in the first place.,F,36,5  days? 4X D,10/12/2010Email,Sporanox
25, 1, Possible Candidas,Horrible abominable constipation and serious bloating. Very bad rash in private/rear end area (or sudden severe hemmoriods x 30!!!!!!),"Take this OFF THE MARKET!!!!I was supposed to take this for 2 weeks and tried to tough it out_ thinking the consipation could mean I had candida and the yeast were dying (as this is known in natural circles as a common event. Overgrowth of yeast die rapidly in intestines and stop you up.)... This constipation was despite the fact I take many herbal laxatives (doctor approved)for a dysfunctional intestines. The medicine completely undid the laxatives. I also spend around $100 that first week on pro-biotics in addition to my  normal tons of probitics in an attempt to make my stomach bloating and pain go down. (It was so severe I got many questions as to how far along in my ""pregnancy"" I was. I am less than 120 lbs and 5.5tall. ) After one week I could not hack it any longer. Immediately on stopping I developed what are either tons of hemmoroids in addition to 3 huge ones or blisters or a rash in and around the buttox area. Now I am in tons of pain from that. This is not an std as I have absolutely no way to contract one as I have been celibate for over 10 years. I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever take this medicine or anything like it ever ever again. I DO NOT_ ABSOLUTELY DO NOT-- RECOMMEND THIS MEDICINE!!!!! I did not know about the possible deaths_ and the doctor told me I would experience no adverse effects whatsoever_ after much questioning. Thanks a lot for lying_ doc. Again.

28, 5, Athlete's foot which spread,None,I had Athlete's foot (caused by stress at work) and because I did not treat it_ it spread to my eyes and hair causing hair loss and an itching in my eyes which was unbearable. I woke up one morning to find that my pillow was a brilliant yellow (due to the fungus) my fault though as I used to go to bed with wettish hair (I have thick hair which takes ages to dry and I was so busy at the time). took Sporanox and hair loss stopped_ eyes stopped itching and my 'widow's peak' of hair at the front returned!!

30, 5, sinus mold/yeast,None,I don't knw why so many negative comments.  I suffered for years with yeast and chronic sinus infections.  Finally after two sinus surgeries a new ENT wa smart enough to culture and found resistant mold in sinus.  I had been on Diflucan daily only to go into infection whenever off Diflucan or antibiotics. The Sporanox wiped it out.  A little itching (normal when treating fungal) and best if you take with soda as it works better on acidic stomach.  Take after food.  The persistant vaginal yeast I had forever finally cleared and many other things.  The mold apparently is one picked up in hospitals and I'm pretty cetain I obtained it during the sinus surgery to begin with.  This is one of the few meds that works on resistant yeast/certain molds.  Had no problems with this med.  Oh...stay away from caffine while taking and that will help the folks with the heart palps.  This med was a life saver for me after 4 years of chronic infection unresolved until culture showed specific mold i nsius and lacrimal eye sac.,F,46,30  days,7/22/2009,Sporanox

40, 3, Fungal infection on my back,The medicine did clear up the infection on my back_ which had persisted for 12-years (since the 9th month of pregnancy). Had gone to many derm docs and spent thousands of dollars on creams_ soaps_ and other meds. No one ever suggested a cure from the inside out until Sporanox. Took pulse over 14-days in late June with minimal side effects. Started with a 7-day pulse in mid-September that cleared up the infection and almost wiped me out. I ended up in the hospital due to elevated blood pressure_ irregular heart beats_ tingling sensations in all extremeties_  rash on both legs_ and disorientation. Extremely frightening! In addition_ I experienced terrible headaches for which I took an Excedrin. The two drugs did not work well together_ which caused my blood pressure to elevate even higher.
