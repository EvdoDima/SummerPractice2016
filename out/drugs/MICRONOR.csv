0, 1, Birth control,I was recommended to come off cilest pill which I'd been on since I was 16 _ they told because of my age 37 that I hold come off it as high risk of breast cancer _ stroke _ etc . They recommened this mini pill micronor but I'm not getting on well with at all I had two heavy periods _ my breasts are very sore _ so much so I can't sleep on my side for long _ my calves and legs are aching and painful and this scares me as my dad nearly died of DVT . Other side effects are increased anxiety & panic attacks my mum is schizophrenic so mental health issues run in my family _  headaches and shooting pains in my pelvis ovary area . I have fibroids & pelvis inflammatory disease and this is making it worse .,I am going to make a doctors appointment as I feel I should come off it as not happy at all with how it making me feel . I don't feel like myself at all,F,37,4  months 1X D,8/14/2016Email,Micronor
1, 4, estrogen contraceptive altnerative,I had to switch to micronor due to the higher risk of stroke and possibly having had minor strokes while using combination pills.  When I started the pill I was bleeding a lot and heavily which was not common for me.  I also experienced cramps and breast soreness for the first time.    It has leveled out for me and now I have grown two cup sizes larger (bonus)_ no weight gain issues_ no severe depression_ higher sex drive_ appetite the same.  Nothing really negative except the occasional random bleeding events.  These may be tied to the times where I have missed taking the pill by greater than 2 hours.,Might be giving me mood issues and pms but I have been on contraception for ten years so who knows anymore.,F,26,10  months 1X D,7/14/2016,Micronor
2, 5, Birth Control,Missed or very light periods. Haven't had a regular flow since I began taking (not a bad thing). Occasional sore breasts. Slightly decreased sex drive and lubrication. Not enough to cause an issue.,Overall no major issues. I can't take combination pills due to migraine with aura. My migraines have actually decreased since taking this. Overall_ very happy with this medicine.,F,29,1  years0.35mg,6/26/2016,Micronor
3, 1, Contraception,Bloating nausea mood wings emotional wreck paranoid back pain irregular bleeding stomach cramps exhaustion,How is this on the market. So glad I came on here I've been a wreck and it's obviously because of this pill. I keep weighing myself as I'm so bloated!! I nearly split with my partner as I was convinced he didn't want me. I felt fat and gross. I feel so sick and got pains in ky stomach and back  I've barely left the house in the last 2 weeks!!! I've been depressed in the past so just blamed myself bt with all the other symptoms it's obviously the pill. Don't feel myself at all just want to sleep. No patience with my kids. Nt taking another one now just hope it gets out if system quickly,F,37,7  weeks,5/31/2016Email,Micronor

5, 1, Contraceptive,Amenorrhea (no period)_ mood swings_ anxiety_ depression_ nausea_ cramping_ decreased sex drive_ cystic acne_ rashes.,I had never taken this birth control before. It was recommended because I was breastfeeding_ and we are not planning on having more children (we have 3). I have been taking it for a little over 3 months now and have noticed that overall I do not 'feel like my self'. I started feeling distant with my husband_ my children_ etc. Not wanting sex_ when my sex drive is normally very high (at least daily). Not wanting to spend the time with my children (whom I love SO much) doing the things we normally did. I noticed my skin was changing too. My skin is generally perfect_ but now I spontaneously get an itchy rash in areas (typically my face and neck). I also have been getting cystic acne on my face. I felt a change in my self and was unable to explain why -down_ sad_ moody_unmotivated_ fatigued. I started searching out possible answers_ and it wasn't until I came here that I saw other women were experiencing the same thing! I am stopping this pill immediately.,F,32,3  months,5/11/2016,Micronor
6, 1, For birth control,Bad weight loss_ blurred vision_ depression_ anxiety_ itchy skin_ vaginal itching_ panic attacks_ mood swings_ constant bladder irritation_sore chest,The worst side effect was the weightless as I am a 5ft n 8 stone before taking it since taking it I have dropped below 7st it makes me feel disgusting every birth control pill has done the same to my weight no matter how much I eat it just will not put weight on. I'm currently not taking it due to the side effects,F,31,2  years30,4/30/2016,Micronor
7, 1, Contraception,Oily skin_ tender breasts_ severe mood swings_ depression_ suicidal thoughts_ disconnection from loved ones_ panic attacks_ periods every week_ low self esteemI was advised by Dr to take this mini pill as I was having issues with the other pill and two fittings of the coil had failed. The first cycle I was fine_ still my happy self_ very out going_ very confident_ high sex drive_ regular period then that's when things took a downward spiral.,I noticed I had got very clingy to my boyfriend constantly looking for reassurance that he loved me and wanted to be with me which is very unlike me and nothing had changed then I started getting a period every single week. It started with a 7 day long periodwhich was unusual for me usually lasting 3-4 days and then after spotting half way through the week I got another period. Ever since then_ every week I have bled sunday-wednesday_ spotting Friday and the whole thing starts again. This itself already lowered my self esteem. My sex drive dropped as I felt so self conscious and paranoid my boyfriend would find me disgusting despite him reassuring me he didnt. Then my mood plummeted. I have always experienced anxiety but never depression and I think I only got it mildly so I feel for anyone suffering from full blow depression. I was experiencing suicidal thoughts_ I had a panic attack when out with my boyfriend and we had to leave immediately which worried him. I couldn't see anyway out of how I was feeling I just constantly wanted to sleep so I didn't feel anything and I was always without fail heartbroken upon waking in a morning knowing I was going to have to endure it again. One morning I contemplated leaving work to isolate myself from everything as I felt I could not cope with anything. I will not take another Micronor pill again and I don't even want to take the risk with anything else containing hormones so I will try for the non hormonal coil once again.,F,19,4  months30 1X D,4/26/2016Email,Micronor

9, 1, To regulate my cycles. Drs advice.,Severe anxiety and panic. Social anxiety. Depression. No appetite. Nausea and vomiting. Feeling of overall doom and gloom.,I have a history of anxiety. Never have I felt such crippling effects from it though. I was always able to talk myself out of a panic attack which I can now say we're only ever mild attacks. I experienced my first full blown panic attack about a month ago and was sure that it was the end for me. I finally did come out of it_ but only time helped. I was unable to calm myself. I have always been a very happy and social person and this drug robbed me of that too. It came to a head while my husband and I were on a cruise recently. I was barely able to leave the room and was crying for hours on end. I had lost all interest in everything!  Thank God I figured it out because after only 3 days of stopping this poison_ I was myself again. Truly a miracle because I don't know where I would be right now. I hope this helps others who may be experiencing similar symptoms :),F,43,3  months,4/16/2016,Micronor
10, 2, Doctor recommendation,Low sex drive_ breakout in spots_ heavy discharge,I was previously on the depo which worked well for me for years however_ I started to bleed every single day non-stop and my doctor recommended I change my contraception. After a few months mircronor does seem to have solved this problem as I havent had a period for 2 months but my sex drive is non existent. It has started to cause problems in my relationship and I need to change asap.,F,25,6  months 1X D,4/12/2016,Micronor
11, 5, Cannot take combined pill,When I started taking micronor I had light bleeding for about three weeks. I then had a regular period but now in the last 6 months I don't have a period anymore. If I do forget a pill then it causes me to ovulate which I am feel and then  two weeks later I will get a very short period and some breast tenderness. However_ if I take it correctly this pill is amazing for myself. And since taking it my migraines have subsided.,,F,16,1  years,3/31/2016Email,Micronor
12, 1, Birth control,Anxiety_ paranoia_ panic attacks_ trembling_ agitation_ suicidal thoughts,My GP suggested this as I can't take the combined Pill_ and Feanolla made me agitated and unwell. For the first few days_ I thought it would be fine. Since then_ though_ I have started to feel paranoid_ angry_ tearful and generally revolting. I am ridiculously clingy with my boyfriend (which he hates_ not least as it's not 'me')_ and am constantly seeking reassurance from him. Every tiny joke sends me over the edge. I am shaking from head to toe_ as If I have drunk a litre of coffee. I spent an hour crying this afternoon_ wondering how I could get through the remaining minutes of the day. I am having a stressful time at the moment_ but I think this is both disproportionate and out of character_ as I am normally a very happy and relaxed person. I didn't take my pill this morning_ hoping that I would feel instant elation (as I did when I stopped Feanolla)_ but no difference so far - so now wondering how long it takes to get out of one's system. Please_ please let it be soon. No more hormonal contraception for me.,F,44,10  days 1X D,3/27/2016,Micronor

Regular periods with reduced flow. Bliss. Then it all went wrong. I often missed periods_ which I was fine about_ but when they arrived they just wouldn't go away. Bleeding for months at a time. My GP said it was simply clearing out my built up womb lining_ but how much can one woman have? The bleeding is bad enough but the headaches_ mood swings and cramps are awful too.

27, 3, After having a blood clot,Heavy periods_ weight gain_ acne_ facial hair growth_ oily/dry skin.,Was prescribed this contraception 2 years ago. Shortly after giving birth to my daughter I was on the dianette pill for 6 months. While on this dianette I got a DVT (BLOOD CLOT) so was taken off this immediately. Health professionals then told me that my only form of contraception would be the micronor pill. I agreed (as I didn't want to fall pregnant again) and have been taking this micronor pill for 18 months. At the beginning I was fine up until June/July this year (2015) I've been getting facial hair growth_ especially around the chin area. Acne_ also around the chin area. Very heavy periods. Weight gain_ dramatically! I've always been a size 10_ I'm now a 14! Feel depressed and angry which is getting worse. I just don't know what to do anymore. I've been to my doctor's unaccountable times and they're doing nothing. I have decided to take this matter into my own hands and have taken myself off micronor.

I switched from Tricyclen about 6 months ago and was put on this medication due to health reasons.

It wasn't until around the 6 month mark where all hell broke lose! I bleed every other week! My poor boyfriend never gets sex anymore because this pill took all the desire for sex away! I have naturally dry curly hair and every since taking Micronor it is extremely oily I have to wash it way too much which is damaging.

I thought_ ""we all have different bodies_ those things won't happen to me!"" But it did. I have high blood pressure so Progesterone only pills are the only option for me. Since day 1 I have been getting my period every other week and spot in between periods. When I went back to the doctor to complain about the pill he told me that it's because even if you take it 5 minutes late_ you will get your period. So I started taking it at exactly the same time every day with no 5 minute delays and I was STILL getting my period every other week with spotting in between. For the past 3 months I am constantly on the verge of tears and will cry about the lamest things. I'm overly sensitive to any sort of negative comment and I was never like that before. I have a lack of interest to go out and spend time with the ones I love. In the past year of taking this pill_ I put on 30lbs. I've been going to the gym and dieting for 4 months now (for real not just half-assing it)_ and I only lost 14lbs. I feel like the pill is now keeping from losing the weight.

49, 1, Initially for breast feeding,Insane and drastic mood swings. No sex drive.,"This is the BC from hell. I initially went on it because I was breast feeding. I stayed on it because I liked the one hormone aspect_ and don't like pills that force my body in to a schedule. It wasn't until I had been on it for about 5 years that things started to change. Because I'd been on it for so long with no issues_ it never crossed my mind to think it was the pill. Out of nowhere came horrific mood swings and depression. I was diagnosed with GAD. I started developing cysts in my breasts_ and all the glands would swell two weeks prior to my period. The pain was excruciating. My breasts would swell to triple their size. As soon as my period would come_ all would return to normal (aside from the mood swings and depression). I was told because the issues with my breasts were cyclamtic_ there was no cause for concern_ and was diagnosed with Fybrocystic Breast Disease. 6 months ago_ my cycles started going fairly wonky. I was bleeding for weeks at a time_ whereas I'd always been fairly regular. My doctor decided that perhaps my body was ""done"" with the micronor_ and suggested I try something else. EVERY LAST ISSUE WENT AWAY WHEN THE MICRONOR WENT AWAY. I spent years in a horrible state of depression_ and 2 weeks out of every month with breasts so sore and swollen I didn't dare wrap a towel around myself when getting out of the shower_ or dare let one of my kids put their head on my chest.

I look 2-3 DAYS pp not months pp. I had lost all my pregnancy wt gain within a few weeks pp but started gaining again when I started the micronor.  Worst of all the mood swings. Anger and anxiety was horrible. My husband would mention I was being mean. I would snap at the smallest things. Thought I was going crazy. No periods either but I'm ok with that. No sex drive. I didn't put all these symptoms together until I started reading these reviews.,,F,41,1  months,6/16/2015,Micronor
51, 1, Birth control,Head aches_ two periods each month_ pain everywhere and can not sleep! I changed pills 9 month ago due to prolonged period and now looks like I have to come off this one!,4 months into it I started having two periods EACH month and I was very scared. After two months of this is started feeling faint and in pain 24/7 I can not cope with it.The main thing I can't deal with is the amount of periods I'm going trough. My periods were very regular before this pill. I've had mood swings and depression and suicidal thought. It's horrible going trough this due to the pill. I was a happy health and active teenager before this pill came along. Might just be better off just using condoms instead,F,17,9  months,6/10/2015Email,Micronor

54, 3, Heavy periods due to fibroid.,Very heavy periods  causing me to miss time off work.,I had been on this pill for 20 years in the past with no issues. I was diagnosed with a fibroid 8 months  ago after coming  off this pillfor 6 months. I tried cerazette  but bled daily for 5 months so switched back to micronor and although I only bleed at period time. It is super heavy with clots causing me to miss time off work. My periods  last 8 days and are heavy for 6 days. I plan to come off this pill and try the mirena coil.,F,44,2  months0.35mg,5/22/2015Email,Micronor
55, 4, birth control,Noticed so many negative comments on here! I was very happy on this pill for years. I think most of you are most probably progesterone intolerant hence why you experience the bad effects.,,F,53,3  years350,5/18/2015Email,Micronor
56, 3, Cannot take anything with estrogen,I got EXTREMELY heavy periods every two weeks for the first 4 months. Could hardly get out of the house... Now after one year it is very light but it is still every other week which is very annoying. I think my sex drive has decreases and i have actually lost weight since i started taking it. I am considering stopping it altogether but i am a little hesitant as i was never regular before and i would sometimes spot for 3 weeks straight...,,F,24,1  days,5/16/2015,Micronor
57, 4, Migraine management,Some weight gain,Tried this as a last option for chronic migraines (been going to neurologists for years with no relief). I gained a bit of weight at first but nothing noticible by others. Periods have gone and only a bit of spotting every 2 months or so. I think this is a great option for migraine sufferers with hormonal triggers.,F,31,7  months 1X D,5/7/2015,Micronor
58, 1, Birth control,Sore breastsBody ache TiredExtreme mood changesDepressionIncreased anxietyWeight gain,Stopping this drug today. Was unaware it would have this much effect on my mental health. I cannot continue on a pill that causes me to be emotionally unstable. Nearly ruined my relationship. had extreme mood swings and depression. Weight gain and acne were the first things I noticed. About 3 weeks in_ woke up feeling sore all over. My body was aching. And Breast pain followed. Once I realized my moods were becoming extreme I decided it's not worth it. This pill changed my moods so much I can barely recognize myself. I went from cheerful_ motivating and happy_ to crying daily and having emotional breakdowns. Hoping the effects of this pill are out of my system asap.,F,36,1  months,5/1/2015Email,Micronor
59, 1, Birth control,Moody_ extremely depressed. Spotting between period. Weight gain. Zero sex drive,this is the worst pill ever. The clinician put me on it because she didn't trust putting me on the combo pills due to my fluctuating blood pressure. Keep in mind I've been on the combination pills all my life and never had problems. I started taking this pill on my period and instantly noticed My period lasted a full 6-7 days. Not cool. 2 weeks into taking this pill_ I was bleeding again. Not cool. It's been 4 days and I'm still bleeding. It's not light spotting. It's heavy like a period. I've also been trying to lose weight and i feel like this pill is making it hard for my weight to drop no matter what i do. I also feel so depressed that I'm close to crying sometimes. im returning these pills asap and gonna try to get back on the combination pill. Stay away from this pill_ it should be banned!,F,26,2  weeks,4/28/2015Email,Micronor
60, 2, Endometriosis_ extreme pain during,Lack of interest_ indifference_ mood swings_ hair loss_ loss of sex drive,Thank god I found these reviews_ I thought I was losing my mind_ and never connected these side effects to the pill. I'm typically a very happy and energetic girl by nature_ and going into year 2 with this pill I lost interest and energy to do ANYTHING. This indifference affected my work life tremendously. Going outside of my room felt like a chore. I could go from extreme happiness (short lived) to anger in a second. I thought I was becoming bipolar! I have no history of depression and truly feel for those going through it. My hair thinned out_ my hands and feet have consistently felt cold_ and I have not had any period in the two years of taking this pill. My sex drive has totally disappeared. Going off of it today - I want to be myself and happy again.,F,25,2  years,4/22/2015Email,Micronor
61, 5, Contraception,I have not had a period since starting to take Micronor_ which is great. I have had no other side effects.,It has been a very successful pill for me.,F,54,14  years 1X D,4/21/2015,Micronor
62, 1, Period control,It took four months for my body to get use to this pill and everything seemed okay after...but for the past 1yr or so I have been stuffing with migraines more frequently_ my skin is awful and my periods are lasting much longer than before. It is now four weeks since my period started and I see no end in sight this has become a regular occurrence.......As of today I have stopped taking this pill hopefully this makes a positive difference in my life asap,Also I have gained a lot more weight and can't seem to shift it plus I forever feel tired no matter how much sleep I get.,F,31,4  years,4/7/2015,Micronor
63, 3, Contraception,Experienced spotting when I first started it and a few heavier periods but after 2-3 cycles/months it all settled down. My periods were shorter and lighter and less painful - my skin was clearer_ I put on no weight and I didn't become pregnant. I was vigilant about taking it at exactly the same time each day and I never missed a pill. Unfortunately though I felt increasingly down like I was living under a black cloud_ my emotions were so on the edge I would cry or snap over the smallest thing and I seemed to have many anxieties and would become paranoid about things. The problem was I couldn't always see it in myself and just accepted how I was....,This pill works if you take it at the exact time each day and physically can be quite side effect free once it settles in your system. Mentally though is another matter- my relationship has suffered extremely with my dramatic mood swings and issues with every little thing and inability to deal with anything- all of which disappeared instantly once I stopped taking it. I rated it 3 because really it would get a 5 for how well it worked_ how my cycles were short and still pretty regular and no pregnancy but 1 for how it affected my mood. I think you have to try and see for if it doesn't affect your mood then it offers side effect free reliable contraception.,F,35,3  years,3/31/2015,Micronor
64, 2, Couldn't take cerizette,Was great to begin with but now for the past 2 months I've ha a period every other week.

Who needs to fit into pants when you bloat like you 3 months pregnant. And my Breast. Filled out and proud to show them off_ but no touching for they hurt so bad. And took my sex drive. Caught up on sleep for my boyfriend thought I was loosing my mind and didn't know who I was. Worst Pill EVER!Stay sane.  Don't take this shit...,,F,37,1  days,3/12/2015,Micronor
68, 1, Birth control,Low sex drive_ clitoral desensitisation_ problems getting to sleep_ trouble waking up.,I have to say these are the only side effects I have experienced so much better than some pills but the low sex drive is causing problems for me emotionally and for mine and my partners relationship!,F,21,4  months,3/3/2015,Micronor
69, 3, Contraceptive,Incredible breast tenderness Periods were longerSpotting Mood swings,I had a good start with micronor and then 6 months into taking it I have experienced spotting and longer periods. My breasts are swollen and really sore. I am not sure to carry on with it and try and ignore these side effects or stop it all together.Any one else experiencing this?,F,34,6  months30mg,2/19/2015,Micronor
70, 4, Heavy painful periods_ contraceptoo,No period at all so far. Before taking this pill I had quite bad breakouts of acne during my period_ and relatively clear skin for the rest of the month. So far while taking micronor I haven't had a period and have had clear skin so I'd say it's benefitted my skin. Have put on 3 pounds since starting it but I've been eating loads- don't know if that's because pill has increased my appetite or not but either way I've put on weight. No increase in breast size. No depression or mood swings. Basically micronor has made me have no pms symptoms at all because no period.,I was initially scared to try this pill due to reading so many bad reviews_ but I won't be changing it any time soon.,F,18,6  weeks350mg,2/18/2015,Micronor
71, 3, Birth Control,I experience irregular periods.  Sometimes I have heavy periods_ sometimes I have super light periods that last about three days_ or I simply don't have a period at all.  It's somewhat annoying not having a regular period.  I'_m not sure if my body has yet to adjust but it's been 4 months.. you would think it should be acquainted by now.  I have not experienced any weight gain but find it rather difficult to loose weight...my weight isn't even fluctuating.  Going along with these side effects_ I notice I have become short tempered.  Not sure if this just has to do with my everyday events going on in my life or if it's actually a side effect from the pill itself.  Acne has always been an ongoing battle_ Micronor hasn't helped with clearing it nor has it made it worse.,Considering switching my pill,F,18,4  months 1X D,2/18/2015Email,Micronor
72, 1, birth control_ period,Headaches_ severe depression_ mood swings_ decreased appetite,Unfortunately my only option for oral contraceptive was micronor since an estrogen based pill was not an option. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. For the short amount of time I was on micronor I experienced a constant dull headache. Nothing compared to a migraine or concussion type headache_ just an annoyance. I also experienced depression that gradually got worse as I continued to take this drug. It is important to note that_ prior to taking this drug_ I had never experienced depression nor taken a drug that had induced such feelings. It is difficult to say whether my loss of appetite was from micronor_ the depression it caused_ or a combination - regardless it was present. Throughout the entire time I was taking this pill I experienced awful mood swings. These were not your typical PMS mood swings. Everything I could once tolerate became incredibly annoying. I felt unable to control these mood swings. I eventually decided to discontinue the medicine. For me_ the cons greatly outweigh the pros with this pill. I'm very thankful I knew these were side effects of the drug so I could act appropriately.,F,,2.5  weeks 1X D,2/15/2015,Micronor

75, 1, As a birth control method,Today I noticed that I was especially feeling just blah and today would be the 6th day since I begin taking micronor. I had no energy and I felt cranky and everything just got on my nerves. I felt like just sleeping my life away as a coping mechanism. Having been through postpartum depression in the past this defiantly felt like the onslaught of the beginning of depression. Needless to say the three months worth are in the garbage. I am going off the pill and I'm going to stick to condoms. I noticed the side effects right away cause I am very in tune with my body and I have been tracking my cycles for 6months now. This behaviour and moodiness was defiantly out of character for me. I wonder if progesterone Is the same hormone responsible for postpartum depression,,F,34,6  days.35mg,1/27/2015,Micronor

The headaches accompanied by ringing in the ears started 2 weeks ago. I'm stopping this ASAP and going to see my doc tomorrow.

I saw a doctor 6 weeks after I started the drug bcos I was unable to function_  he gave me trazadone_  it didn't work. Checked into the urgent care few weeks later_ he gave me remeron_ sadly it only worked for one night. I couldn't take the side effects of feeling drowsy and lethargic.

It didn't stop my periods entirely until the 6th month. However anxiety started to creep in slowly. So slowly that I didn't link it to micronor until the 6th month. Panic attacks while driving which is so scary. All symptoms flare acutely before my period. Finally this month and last at the same time i was scheduled to have a period_ I started having headaches at the same time as racing heart and I felt like my head was buried in a black fog. Absolutely terrible feeling_ like you're out of control and going to die. I could only stare at the ceiling and wait for hours until it finally subsided.

I am constantly tired_ I wake up tired and I go to bed exhausted and I get the recommended 8 hours of sleep a night.My mood is so unpredictable_ one moment I will be happy and the next I will be depressed. I thought I was becoming bipolar and it was terrifying to me. I lash out at my husband for no reason and I have become very irrational when dealing with everyday things. My periods are never regular_ sometimes I'll get my period twice a month and sometimes I wont get my period for 4 months straight.I have also experienced memory problems_ I will be having a conversation and all of a sudden I will forget what we are talking about. It is very scary.I find myself also being very irrational_ I can't stay home alone anymore and things that never scared me before_ terrify me.This is a long list and I am so happy that I found this website and realized I am not the only one going through this. I honestly thought that I was going crazy_ I didn't think that it could be the birth control I was taking. As of today I will no longer be taking micronor.

My sex drive has disappeared & my fiancé will too I fear if I don't get back to my old self. I have never suffered any kind of depression or feelings like this before and hope I will feel better in a few weeks once I stop taking Micronor.

88, 1, Contraceptive/periods,Depression_ anxiety_ severe weight loss_ lack of apetite_ fatigue_ suicidal,So a year ago I began taking this. A year ago was also when I began to experience a dramatic decline in my mood. The past year has been hell_ I have experienced every symptom of every mental illness in the book. Since taking this pill i have had no interest or energy for anything_ i have dramatically lost my apetite resulting in over a stone lost in exactly a year (when i started taking it)_ since taking the pill i have started self harming_ my relationships with others have been ruined due to this new personality the pill has given me_ been referred to a mental health clinic. The mood swings are so awful that it gets to the point where you wonder if you have biploar_ literally fine as anything one second then an anxious emotional mess the next. This pill has messed up my hormones and my mind and every aspect of my life. Everyone thought i had developed some serious issues. A few days ago i stopped taking the pill and it has been the best decision i've made since i begun. I finally feel like myself_ my brain chemicals and hormones feel balanced. I'm so happy i realised before it was too late. I urge anyone with similar symptoms to come off the pill- IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!

So I am sensitive to hormones_ after bad experiences with nuva ring_ and combination pill_ my dr offered the idea to try the mini pill which only has progesterone. I was really excited hoping I was only sensitive to combo pills. I never had depression before. I am a healthy marathon runner_ and about 2 weeks in I woke up in a fog_ a nasty dream like estate. When everything in my life is great! Feelings of despair_ and fright_ but no reason to be frightful_ finding myself to fusterated at night that I just cry myself to sleep scared to death? It's a slow fade_ an I hit a wall with this pill. Not refilling my pack tomorrow. My husband says it's not worth feeling this awful. We will just do family planning or condemns till maybe trying the paragard. (No hormones). No one should ever feel this way. I don't have depression_ but this month has really opened my eyes to what the people with chronic depression go through. I am going to pray for them. Because just a month of this was awful.

96, 1, contraception,unbelievable weight gain and anxiety due to lack of periods,I was put onto micronor by my new GP as apparently I think ( there was no consultation just a change of prescription ) had been taking Cilest for too long although it suited me and I was perfectly happy.  I suffer from depression also and didnt realise this pill could make that worse.  For me though_ not knowing when my period is coming has caused me so much anxiety.  Constantly thinking I could be pregnant_ taking tests_ not sleeping.  Pregnancy was a real worry as the weight gain and breast enlargement have been significant - just like when I was expecting.  I have gone up a cup size ( DD - E ) and from a 12 to a tight 14.  I have put on over half a stone in 4 months.  I am constantly hungry and windy_ am on slimming world diet with disappointing results which has worked fine for me in the past.  After reading all these reviews I am stopping taking them immediately and will try for sterilisation.  What an awful tablet and shame on the Doctor for putting me through this ( yes_ I know they are trying to look after us but I wasnt consulted - just swapped with no discussion at all ),F,42,4  months 1X D,9/17/2014,Micronor
97, 4, For contraceptive,This would be my second month into taking Micronor and so far_ so good. When I first started taking birth control_ I was put on Alesso which caused spotting for me. The doctor then gave me a 3 month trial of Tri-Cyclen Lo which was just awful. I would get extremely agitated and when it was time for my period I would get the worst cramps where I couldn't even move or breath. After_ I requested for the Evra patches since I started getting a really bad habit of forgetting to take my pill. The first night of application I experienced severe abdominal pain..  To the point where I thought I had to go to the hospital. After that night though_ I didn't get any side effects other than extreme fatigue on the day of my period. I eventually switches from the patches as I am a smoker and my smoking had increased. I was then put on Tri-Cyclen where I had absolutely no problems with other than moderate to medium fatigue during my period and my skin was always so clear until my 7 day break as well. I decided to try Micronor because my friend (pharmacist) said that there is a lower risk of blood clots with smokers who take birth control. I haven't experienced any side effects other than during the first month I was a bit more irritable (I think I still am actually_ I'll have to put  that to the test and switch back to Tri-Cyclen).

Over the last few months my depression has got worse and worse_ I have started to self harm and am frequently suicidal.

I'm 34 and I've been taking Micronor for 5 months. My GP put me on it as I was suffering with severe period pain and PMT. I can't take the normal pill as I get migranes. I' m usually quite a happy and positive person but the last few months  I've felt as though I've had a personality transplant. I've been feeling so depressed and weepy_ found myself crying more in the last 5 months than I have in my entire life. Even had sucidal thoughts which was really scary and not something I ever want to expreience again. I've had no interest in anything - everything is an effort. Been snappy and nasty almost every day which is not me at all. I've felt as though I want to isolate myself from everyone and everything. Been suffering from sever bloating and IBS like symptoms and constipation. Haven't been able to lose any weight (not even 1lb) despite eating healthy and exercising!I really thought there was something menatlly wrong with me - until I found this website last week. I cannot explain how relieved I felt to see that there was an explantation for the change in my moods etc. I stopped taking Micronor a week ago and feel so much better already it's unbelievable.

I really thought I was loosing my mind with all of the symptoms especially the severe breast pain/tenderness and the weight gain. I really can not explain the pain/tenderness of my breasts it was awful. My clothes were becoming tight_ this after just purchasing new clothes after weight loss. I work out 5/6 times a week pretty hard core and I knew exactly what my weight was prior to taking this awful pill. I was so tired that I went from working out 5/6 days a week to barely 3 due to extreme exhaustion alone. I had been getting up for my 6 am workouts for over a year with rarely an issue.6 am workouts can be tough to get use to but_ I had managed to bounce up with little extra effort after only a few months in_ you really do get use to working out that early. Then cut to taking this pill and I was fighting to get up. Needless to say these side effects are no where near worth it to me.  I stopped this pill a few days ago and today I have severe cramps and I am bleeding more than I ever had.

I_ like others on this page_ had to stop taking a combined pill due to my age.  I had been on the combined pill (Logynon) for a long time with no trouble at all_ but within a couple of weeks of taking Micronor I started noticing my breasts were extremely tender and I had a bloated stomach.  Within 4-6 weeks I had put on over a stone.  I am actually a bit annoyed that my doctor prescribed this - I realise he couldn't have known how I'd react to it_ but knowing that I was also suffering from anxiety and depression should have rung some alarm bells at least.... I know I have taken at least a 25% step backwards now...I am anxious all over again and am so irritable I find it difficult interacting with people without biting their heads off!  All this and it's only my 2nd month on them!  Well_ it's my last - I have one more pill to take tonight and then I'm not taking them anymore.

114, 4, To stop periods completely,Tender breasts_ occasional cramping,I started taking this medication to stop my periods completely because I am on blood thinners and my periods were severely heavy_ I was losing so much blood that I became severely anemic every time I had my period. I took the generic form of Micronor for a year and was told by my doctor that it would take about a year for it to stop my periods_ but after a year I still had a period about every 3 months_ in which my periods would last 3 weeks. At the start of the generic I gained 20 lbs the first month and another 20 the following year. At the 1 year mark I switched to the name brand of Micronor because my doctor said that some women react better to the name brand than the generic. I have not had any side effect or weight gain with it and I only had one last period right after taking it that lasted 4 days. So far it's been 4 months and no period. So far_ it's working like it was intended and I'm very happy with it. If you're reading this and thinking about taking this med_ I'd encourage you to get the name brand if possible.,F,26,1.5  years.35 1X D,6/28/2014Email,Micronor

I thought I was just depressed_ having moved to a new city and recently graduated. I thought that the monthly rent_ my new job_ having a few amount of friends_ not having the exercise routine I wanted to. I thought maybe it was driving me into a depressive hole. But everything was so bad. I am still on it currently and I can tell you I have major lack of interest in activities_ no drive to try and put myself out there_ and the mood swings. Oh my god the mood swings. Yesterday I had my first anxiety attack. Couldn't breath it was so strong. Literally knocked me down to the floor with all the weight of it's worrisome_ worthlessness. I cry if my boyfriend  does or says something wrong. I mean 4 hours straight crying after already staying up until 3 in the morning and having work at 4:30 the next day. Over Everything. I am typically a logical_ sympathetic person but Micronor threw me over the edge. It was a constant flow of easily jolted desperation to grasp onto my emotions and control myself. I felt irrational. What's lousy is that I blamed myself. I didn't think it could have been my birth control. I was never warned this could be a side effect. I blamed myself for being erratic and did not know why I could not get a handle on myself. As of tonight I am no longer going to be taking Micronor in hopes that within the two week span of filtrating out of ones system_ everything goes back to normal.

My last period was a week early and lasted for a week again! I feel like i am either on my period or having severe PMS constantly! I also feel like this pill is a pain as you have to take it at the same time everyday. I think it works well as a contraception as long as you take it at the same time everyday but for me_ the side effects aren't worth it!

So when I started taking Micronor_ my hands broke out in a HORRIBLE itchy rash. I would get random bug bite looking things all over my hands and my god_ did they itch. I could barely even sleep. I tried anti-itch cream but it barely helped at all. I freaked out for weeks_ thinking I had bed bugs_ but I didn't. I realized it might be the birth control. At that point_ me and my boyfriend broke up so I didn't have to take the pills anymore. After a few weeks I think_ all the itchy bumps went away. Not sure if I'm allergic to it or just a side effect..?,I'm getting super depressed. I can't take anything with estrogen_ and I may be allergic to this. The Depo shot is really bad so I refuse to take that (my mom refuses to let me even if I wanted it). Sure there are condoms and spermicide_ but you know how that goes.

145, 1, Breastfeeding,I started taking this pill when my son was a year old after my period came back (was breastfeeding exclusively) I was having pms and breakouts and do not want to get pregnant right now  I felt a little moodier the first month of taking it. Then I felt more hatred toward my husband then I do when I have pms. Even my kids were getting in my nerves which rarely happens. I agree with other reviews that say you get a weird tired zombie feeling and also pain in the back and body. I was afraid to weigh myself but did feel bloated. I also felt like crying over the silliest things and more anxiety. My sleep was very restless and when I did sleep it didn't feel like a deep sleep and I felt so tired all day  I thought maybe it wasn't the pill but I stopped a few days ago and feel better already. The only good thing is it cleared my skin and stopped my period but then I was paranoid I was pregnant because I felt tired and nauseous. But not pregnant  in glad to see the reviews and know I'm not imagining things,,F,30,2  months1/day,9/19/2013,Micronor

149, 5, birth control,I've been taking this for over ten years. Tried the combination pill as a teen and can't take estogen. Tried depo and got violent migraines. Then tried this and I've been on it ever since. Got off to have a kid and now I'm back on. I love it! Not everyone has a bad experience. My periods were messed up at first but now I have a tiny one each month. You will break out at first also but that goes away when your body adjusts. Give it a chance! It has the least hormones and never caused me to gain Weight.,,F,27,10  years,8/15/2013,Micronor
150, 2, have high blood pressure,OK.. I was on ortho Tri cyclen lo for 6 years and I loved it. my doctor switched me to ortho micronor 2 months ago because of my high blood pressure (ortho Tri cyclen lo increased my chances of having a stroke because of the estrogen in the pills).. but anyway I don't like it! my period stopped immediately and I have already gained 5 pounds. I have been bloated for the past 5 days and my skin is starting to break out! I am also having trouble falling asleep at night (hence why I am on here at 5am leaving a review lol) but I am mostly terrified at not having a period... I feel the need to take a pregnancy test every month :( but I wouldn't recommend this pill.. I was aware of the fact that my period may stop and I was also comfortable because micronor and ortho-lo are made by the same company. BUT I simply cannot deal with these changes. I am very unhappy I am going to see my doctor about getting on another type of birth control... if I could I would definitely switch back to ortho Tri cyclen lo..

Going off this pill right now_ since I now find out it isn't even effective - and if I gain any more weight I won't fit into a single thing I own!! So bad!,I know lots of people have no bad reaction_ but if you have anything within the first week like I did (insanely rapid weight gain)_ SEE THE DOCTOR AGAIN.

156, 5, used to get aura migraines,I was put on micronor because estrogen increased my chances of getting aura migraines. I was very good at taking my pill at the same time every day. In the first year if I took it off schedule even the slightest I would have spotting. I have. Or had a period since then. I never want kids and not having to deal with a period is the most amazing thing ever. In the past while I've been less good about taking it at the same time (new city new job new timezone etc). Still no period or spotting at all - but my boobs have doubled_ and being that I was an A that is a good thing! I have gained about 5 pounds since the move because I'm not as devout at the gym - but before and after starting this pill I was very skinny. I have always had bad skin_ so I missed that benefit of the estrogen pills_ but with the right products and age I seem to be balanced now. All the reviews seem awful - and my friend also had a horrible experience. Guess I lucked out. No periods and perky boobs.,,F,35,5  years.35 mg,6/10/2013,Micronor

I now have a 16 month old and a 3 week old baby and again was put on the micronor because I'm breastfeeding.

193, 4, Blurry Vision and pain in arm,At first I was concerned about the fact that your period is not regulated. I spotted a bit during the first month.No period.,I went onto micronor because I was experiencing loss of vision and pain in my arm. I was switched because my doctor believed that the estrogen in the pill I was on may have been thickening my blood. I was put on this pill because of a specific reason. I have been on this pill for two months now and have never been so happy. I have always had really heavy bleeding my whole life and when i switched to micronor it caused me minor spotting in the first month and I have barely experienced a period otherwise. I believe that this pill is only right for you if you are experiencing the side effects of other pills. You may want to switch because it can potentially stop your period. I only switched because i was experiencing side effects that could have lead to stroke but if you are happy with your pill then stay on it. Any change in birth control will make your body act up for 3 months so the only way to know if you are happy is to stay on the pill for 3 months_ unlike the women that switched and are complaining about symptoms because that is common when switching bc pills. Talk to your doctor and make sure you are switching for the right reasons. Your body is a sacred being and you should not take it for granted.My only concern now is that I have not had my period (which is common in this pill) so now I don't know whether i should be having pregnancy tests done regular or how to go about that.,F,21,60  days 1X D,7/27/2012Email,Micronor

195, 5, Severe Period Pain/PMS,In the beginning- some spotting and seemed I had a period twice in a month. I am taking 3 weeks of the pack_ then skipping the last week (placebo) as it is not for birth control. On and off erratic spotting for about 4-6 months. The hardest part is making sure you take it at the EXACT same time each day. I have an alarm set on my phone and make sure I have the pill with me when I am out. This makes a big difference with spotting.,Miracle Drug for me. I was worried about the constant spotting at first- but then realized compared to the severe and debilitating periods I have been having for about 20 years now- I would take it!  Eventually my body adjusted_ and I think I have had 2-3 periods this entire year. My first real period was longer than usual- and heavy. I was crampy_ but not in the usual severe pain. The next 2 were so light I was not sure it was an actual period. I don't think I have had a period in 6 months and am LOVING life. I not longer suffer from anxiety thinking about how my upcoming period will ruin my plans or cause me to call out of work. Because I am not planning on having any more children and have blood clots in my leg_ this pill is perfect for my situation. My quality of life has drastically improved. Before my doctor prescribed this- I was asking for a hysterectomy. That's how tired I was of being in pain all the time. I have NO other side effects at this point that I notice. I have zero PMS symptoms_ have lost weight_ and feel like a new person. Highly recommended for those who are looking for relief from period pain,F,40,1  years 1X D,7/19/2012,Micronor

201, 1, Birth control,Depression_ crying easily_ restless legs_ lowered sex drive and who knows what else that I just didn't realize micronor was causing!,I overcame severe clinical depression years ago_ and when I started micronor I thought I was spiraling downward. I began to lose hope that I'd ever live a normal life. I cry every night_ feel restless and hopeless_ not to mention there is zero intimacy in my marriage. My mom asked me if I'd made any changes lately_ such as a new pill (she' a nurse) and thank god for her. I looked up micronor and depression and found this site. Thank everyone who rated this drug. I'm stopping this pill tonight. I also noted that many woman got this from planned parenthood_ as I did. They need to seriously work on their provided information. If you've had any of these side effects_ stop this pill ASAP!,F,27,2  months 1X D,6/26/2012Email,Micronor
202, 1, Birth Control,Anxiety_ paranoia_ depression_ low self-esteem and self worth_ feeling disconnected from everyone_ socially isolating myself because of the above. Just not feeling myself for a long time now_ and I just want the old me back. I've been moody_ grumpy. a bit possessive  and paranoid. No issues with random bleeding_ in fact my periods have been pretty regular_ but quite painful. And I seem to get a constant period like pain even when I'm not on my period. Acne_ greasy hair and just generally look terrible! My boobs have decreased in size slightly_ and get quite tender towards my period. Slight weight gain.  However I don't need to worry about getting pregnant because my sex drive is non-existent!!,Started taking Micronor after my blood pressure was raised on the combined pill_ and was told I was no longer recommended to take it (especially as I have a family history of stroke). I have spent the past year or so thinking I have some real issues_ I've been to see counsellors etc. Thinking back_ I was absolutely fine before I started this blasted pill!  I just want to get back to normal and feel the urge to have sex with my boyfriend_ that's the worst side-effect in my opinion!!,F,23,2  years30 1X D,6/19/2012,Micronor

My life has been a struggle since starting hormonal contraceptives and I plan on quitting for good. The side effects have only gotten worse over time and I truly believe that if I were to continue_ I'd be committing a slow suicide thats been ok'd by the FDA. Getting a copper coil instead. Synthetic hormones do damage_ period. Looking forward to getting myself back!,F,30,1.5  years0.35 mg 1X D,6/17/2012Email,Micronor

I had experienced bad mood swings with the 2 previous pills I had been on with estrogen. At first I thought my mood had improved with micronor but now I'm starting to have angry outbursts again and I'm feeling very depressed/disconnected from everyone. I have been very tired the last few days but I am not sure yet if it is from the pill. I have not had any bleeding yet_ which may seem like a good thing_ but I would rather have my period regularly so that I know I'm not pregnant. For that reason alone I would not stop taking the pill_ but if the moodiness/depression continues I would rather take the risk of getting pregnant than keep dealing with the side effects.,,F,21,1  months 1X D,5/27/2012,Micronor

But now I get a period for 2 and 1/2 weeks_ followed by 3 days of nothing_ only then to go BACK on my period. I feel bloated most days and I'm pretty moody. I was told it would make my periods shorter and further apart and it's done the OPPOSITE. I'm very upset about being on this birth control pill and I'm sorry I didn't research it further before agreeing to this. I think I'd rather suffer one week out of the month than be on this.

228, 3, B/C and to ease period hell week,Dizziness_ tiredness_ weight loss.,Not been on it as long as most of the ladies on here but was recommended it due to high blood pressure and my age. I have however lost over 5lbs since starting this last week_ not complaining as I was on a diet anyway but it also may be due to getting a bad cold virus at the same time. Im def not going to take any chances as counting this as B/C as I have read so many stories of unplanned pregnancies resulting from trusting it to work as it should. Im not moody but more relaxed than I was. I have always been emotional so cant say I have seen any change yet apart from being very carefree about everything_ Not been into sex for a while due to getting bored with it anyway ... so cant say I have had a change there either. Have not had any spotting yet_ but if I do start then Im off it immediately_ as its the main reason I started on it.

For the last several months I have been dieting and working out even more_ but nothing is happening! I can't lose weight! Also_ my poor fiancee and daughter have had to deal with the mood swings and depression. I had no idea why I was feeling so unstable. I started wondering if it had something to do with the ortho micronor_ but was unsure. After seeing that this has happened to so many other women_ I am sure it's the ortho micronor! Also_ I have had NO sex drive for the past several months. In fact the thought of sex actually disgusts me on some level. And my poor fiancee has put up with this for months now. It definitely works as birth control because YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX! I can't wait until this pill is out of my system and my body starts returning to normal. We are going back to using condoms.

Very heavy very very painful ""breakthrough"" bleeding between periods. Was almost constant for about 2 months. Then went to Dr who upped my dosage from 1/d to 2/d this made no difference. I was then sent for an Ultrasound scan. Found that I am producing multiple eggs at the same time which could cause cysts if my body does not flush them out so this could be the cause of constant bleeds. Have no stopped taking micronor as Dr found I had an inflamed uterus so was put on deoxycycline and metronizadole for 7days. This made no difference. I have been back and now been put on Femulin. I am yet to start taking it as I am still bleeding as a result of stopping micronor!!! I have had 44days of bleeding since december...Not nice!

It helped my cramps out a bit and bleeding wasn't quite as heavy_ but nothing very major.  Also_ worst of all_ I would get the worst mood swings.

We were TTC for a while but found out due to the endometriosis that we will not be able to_ so OB/GYN said to start Micronor. I havent had any sever migraines since I started it. First 2 months on pills cramping was better. This is my 3rd month now and I have been bleeding for 3 weeks and have horrible cramps. OB/GYN said to try and stick it out. Micronor is supposed to slow down or even stop periods. Clearly not happening! I will be cont. this for 1 more week. If bleeding is still on going_ then I will stop and go back to the OB/GYN. Because I would rather try to treat the migraines and cramps more naturally then deal with ongoing bleeding and cramps all the time!,,F,22,3  months0.35 MG 1X D,2/22/2012Email,Micronor
251, 1, As a contraceptive,Advised to take mini pill due to a migraine with aura on combined pill after many years of taking it with no issues. Absolutely hate the mini pill_ took cerazette for 4 months had awful side effects so changed to micronor . Have now suffered with terrible acne mainly on my face but sometimes on my chest and back for over a year . Confidence shot to pieces. Used to be a very happy go lucky person but over the past year have become hugely over sensitive and out of control of my emotions. Rarely drink but any time I do now it just magnifies all the negative feelings I carry around all the rest of the time and now every night out has resulted in a tearful argument with my boyfriend who until a year ago was my Mr perfect. Don't believe he has changed at all just me since taking this pill. It has clearly turned me into an insecure_ paranoid and depressed individual whos self esteem has no chance due to having a painful_ itchy and unsightly face due to this boil like acne infection. Also last week had a migraine with aura again. Ok so I haven't got pregnant but that's the only positive to this awful medication. Awaiting a doctors appointment so I don't have to fill my body with this rubbish any more and am thankful for a very supportive and understanding boyfriend who agrees I have been a different person for the last year.,,F,31,9  months1 a day,2/20/2012,Micronor

I am now 6 weeks pregnant (my son is only 14 weeks old).,Would not recommend the minipill to anyone.  I certainly did not want to fall PREGNANT so soon after my son was born.

I was prescribed this pill due to once having migraines. The Dr. said that because of my migraine history_ I would have to take Micronor because of it's low dosage of estrogen. When I took it back then_ I had NO periods_ it was great since usually they are quite painful. I stopped taking it thinking I should have a period and started taking in recently again for the purpose of birth control. I get my period every week_ spotty and then extremely heavy. I have never had a period SO heavy before. I also had a migrain last week and I haven't had a migraine since 2007. I am not saying it is because of the pill_ but you never know. Also_ my breast hurt daily and feel like they are on fire! I am more sensitive and tired as well. I have not noticed hair loss or weight gain_ thankfully.

264, 1, Breastfeeding_ birth control.,Weight gain_ bloating_ constant hunger_ irritatbility.,"I am a fitness instructor and exercised both cardio and weight lifting throughout both my pregnancies.  I gained 29 pounds with my last baby (born 11-1-11) and went back to the gym after 2 weeks (with doc's permission).  I had dropped 20 pounds by that time.  I started Micronor after my 5 week checkup and the progress I had been making (both what I could ""feel"" and see on the scale) began regressing.  It didn't take even 2 weeks for me to realize the fact that the weight gain and bloating started when I started taking Micronor.  I am switching to a different BC pill this week.  I am SO angry and SO frustrated with this.  I've spent everyday of the last two weeks crying when I tried to get dressed_ completely confused as to why my belly was swelled up like I was 6 months pregnant again.

265, 1, Combo pill gave me migraines,No period for 5 months after stopping!,I have been on the pill for 5 years. I have been on about 4 or so different types of pill changing for migraines and really bad period pain.. eventually my doctor said take this one you won't get migraines or period pain and granted i haven't had either! Mainly because i've had NO period. Not a single bleed. After reading the instructions to stop taking the pill after 6 weeks if no bleed i did just that...5 months later and i still haven't had a period at 19 and having originally only gone on the pill for pain not contraception I am not impressed that I've had no period and quite frankly have spent 5 months in constant fear of pregnancy or health issues. Not something i would wish on anyone else. My advice is DO NOT TAKE MICRONOR! It is by far the worst pill i've ever used and I can honestly say I have never reacted to a change in pill before. I find this very upsetting and distressing.,F,19,2  months30 1X D,12/28/2011,Micronor

I'd end one period and start another from half a day to 6 months. they would last 1 day to 3 months. I've been having them since 2 days after I turned 8_ I'm 21 now. The bleeding just kept getting worse and worse until the last time(right before I started taking Micronor) I bled for a little over a week and I lost almost 2 pints of blood. It was HORRIBLE. I had to do something. So far since I started taking Micronor - I was super bloated until   like a week ago. Now for the last week I've been getting these super bad headachs (continued),that feel like someone is stabbing my eyeballs with knifes. I've been super nausiated. I've been really dizzy and out of it. Like I was surrounding by fog. Super sore muscles. And my hip has been feeling like it's going to pop in and out of place - which is weird because I'm only 21 and I haven't injured it or anything. And I was bleeding right after I started taking it but since a week ago when I started with these other symptoms I've been bleeding quite a bit but thankfully not as bad as I was before.,F,21,27  days 1X D,12/21/2011Email,Micronor

One weird large cyst on my back last week - could mean acne will happen too. Gained 10 pounds which is actually OK but 10 is plenty thank you! This is my first pill ever_ I only just quit smoking last year. Almost all of you have mood issues too! So far I don't but obviously I'm not impervious to side effects.

Without a period_ and with paranoia of pregnancy_ I've just taken to making sure with a test every few months when I have a boyfriend. I have a high sex drive_ so I don't see this was affected in any way. I always had a small chest - not sure if you can say there's shrinkage. ha I have only had good experiences with this pill.

Also had no period whilst on Micronor_ but nothing to do with potential pregnancy.,Not sure why there are so many horror stories on here as I've not had any problems with Micronor at all_ albeit I'm probably not as far in to using the pill as some on here. When I first got prescribed the pill I did my usual internet research and was shocked to see some of the feedback on here especially - however_ for those of you trying Micronor for the first time then don't take into account what everyone says as not all of us experience the same problems! I was taking Cerazette before being changed over to Micronor and had a myriad of issues - namely incredibly mood swings (often depression_ break downs)_ spotting non-stop for 3-4 weeks at a time_ crazy breast tenderness (to the point it even hurt to walk down the stairs) and acne on certain parts of my body. I can not take the combined pill due to my mother's previous illness of breast cancer being oestrogen receptive so I'm thankful that I seem to have finally found a mini pill that agrees with me and my body_ something I thought wouldn't be possible after the horror of Cerazette! Perhaps the only negative I've experienced is the 3 hour window_ which I have sometimes missed from 15 minutes up to an hour due to a busy daily schedule (or simply forgetting to activate the alarm reminder on my phone) and also a missed period which is frightening by anybody's standards but sadly this is a side effect of all mini pills.

I was on a different POP before this one_ I think it was Merina which I thought was awful as I would be bleeding once a week for 3/4 days and my skin was terrible all the time.  My Dr changed me over to Micronor which originally I thought was brilliant as it cleared up my skin and my periods became regular again......until now.  I have been taking my pill at the same time everyday (7.15am - an alarm is set to remind me).  It ran out 2 weeks ago and I couldn't get to the Dr to pick up more until last week_ but was taking extra precautions with my boyfriend during this time.  The Dr has told me to wait until my period starts again to start taking this pill again_ but in the meantime I wait anxiously for my period (and trying not to stress!) while spending every day running back and forth to the toilet about 15 times a day_ feeling nauseous_ lack of appetite_ struggling to stay awake_ bad indigestion and bloating_ while the pregnancy tests have come back as negative.

Very Very Tired.,I stopped taking Microginon after my husband had a vacectomy_ as i obviously did not need to be careful with pregnancy anymore. I was off it for 4 months with no problems apart from heavier periods and more pain_ my boobs also went up a cup size. I started to get very bloated and thought i had put weight on so i went to the doctor and he told me my body was reacting to the lack of the drug it had been used to for 17years so he suggested Micronor. I have been taking this for 3 weeks and have never felt so sick in all my life (from what i can remember). I feel sick constantly_ my head feels fuzzy_ i am so tired and am usually a very active person_ when i get up for work i feel like i cant possibly get through the day_ i spend most of the day yawning which is ridiculous. This pill is seriously affecting my personal life and working life_ i have decided i am going to stop it and chuck the remaining pills down the toilet tonight.

The first few weeks were okay_ and I didn't notice any bad side effects. However_ I noticed I generally felt unmotivated and tired constantly. I had trouble waking up and felt really tired through the day. Lately I've been feeling depressed and anxious. I get constant headaches. It's not severe_ but it's like a constant pounding in my head all day. I haven't had a period since I've been on the pill but I have had menstral cramps for no reason. My breasts are *extremely* tender and it even hurts to wear a bra. They have also shrunk in size. I have a general loss of appetite_ but it just goes along with feeling tired and depressed; nothing severe_ but like having a fog over your emotions. I always take my pill within 30 minutes of my time and I haven't missed a single one.

Also made me very depressed_ I would randomly start crying for no reason and would get panic attacks. I literally thought I was going insane.

I tried Mirena which was awful and Micronor was even worse! I tried to stick this pill out to see if my body would get used to it_ but I just couldn't see any upside to it any more. I have been bleeding non stop since I started taking it_ not just spotting_ full on period like bleeding. I wish it stopped my periods_ for some reason it seems to have the opposite effect on me. If I knew that would end I would probably try to stick it out_ but I would probably have to enroll in anger management classes.

Enough was enough!! I can't believe this has even been allowed to be prescribed!! Firstly it started with my boobs swelling a size but they were so painful for nearly a month. The pain returns for a few days once a month and the swelling went down but nit much!! Then if I missed a pill for whatever reason I'd have a period within a few days and it would last a whole week and be really heavy with painful cramps. It's my own fault as I forget to take them when I stay away from home_ but I'm now on my 3rd period in 5 weeks!! This time I haven't missed any_ I'm on antibiotics (started Thursday) for tonsillitis and they've stopped it working so got another period (on Sunday)!! To add to this I've been feeling really low and generally unhappy which is not like me! I've been crying over things which never really bother me and then I'd snap at people who would try to make me feel better!! I was on weightwatchers and lost 7lb before starting this pill and haven't managed to lose any more since starting it!!I'd be terribly bloated and painfully uncomfortable for no reason and nothing would help!! And the headaches I had finally got under control a few years ago have come back and usually at night causing me lack of sleep!!

I really thought it was me and my age that was the problem not the pill_  but after reading these posts then  fingers crossed I can get back to normal again. I went to the doctors thinking I had post natal depression_ he said I hadn't I was just very tired (!) but he didn't mention it could've been this pill. Bit annoyed now really.

343, 1, To prevent pregnancy/Nursing,Acne_ Hair Loss_ Weight Gain_ Constant Bleeding and Spotting,I would not recommend this pill to anyone. My doctor prescribed this particular pill to me because I am nursing. My baby is now 2 1/2 months and I have had the worst side effects ever since taking this pill. My skin has the worst case of acne_ I have my menstrual every two weeks and in between that I am spotting with constant cramps that are horrible. I have gained 5 pounds due to an increase in my appetite and my hair has gotten really thin and balding around the edges. I have super thick hair there is no reason for my hair to be so thin now that you can see through my ends.

346, 1, Prevention of pregnancy_ high BP,Extreme fatigue_ never ending periods_ no sex drive_ bloating in the stomach,I have been on micronor for almost 5 months_ and I am extrememly dissatisfied.  Initially I was on nuvaring_ for about 2 years which I loved and had no major problem with other than gaining about 5 pounds over two years time (that may not have been due to nuvaring itself_ obviously) however_ about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and my OB took me off my beloved nuvaring and onto ortho micronor. The first two months I didn't have a period at all_ some small spotting for a few days at the end of the pack would be it.  At this point I wasn't minding the switch too much.  However shortly into the third pack I began bleeding heavy. I thought it was just my period finally coming. Then it didnt stop for 10 days.(mind you_ my periods have always been light and lasted 3-4 days) Had sex_ and the next morning started bleeding again! This has been going on for almost four months now_ and I'm fed up. I stopped taking my pill yesterday_ I cant deal with a constant period. In addition to that_ my sex life is basically non existent (how could it not with a never-ending cycle) but even when im not on my period i cant stand the thought of sex (i was always very sexually active with my partner prior to this) I'm also beyond exhaustion everyday. I'm up at 5am on the weekdays_ and come 1pm I'm ready for a nap. I've always been a morning person and able to wake early and maintain function with little to no sleep_ but since ive been on this pill i feel like its depleting my bo,F,24,5  months 1X D,2/24/2011,Micronor

I had terrible results with that pill (acne_ irritability_ decreased sex drive_ constant spotting/bleeding_ migraines_ mood swings_ hair loss_ vaginal dryness_ depression_ even a stroke) most likely due to the estrogen. I stopped taking birth control completely for 5 months_ and last month I was put on Micronor. So far_ I am happy with the pill_ except for the mild/moderate acne on my face (my face is usually clear_ but breaks out a bit the week before my period.) My period is supposed to come in 3 days_ so that could explain the bad skin.

I was prescribed Micronor and he claimed it would help resolve complications with PCOS such as random migraines_ facial hair_ massively painful ovulation because of cysts_ heavy bleeding_ long periods_ etc. I take Micronor every night at 9:30 pm (by alarm clock_ literally). Just my luck_ 3 days after starting Micronor my appetite was through the roof_ a big rash of small to medium sized pimples started all over my back_ chest and shoulders. I also started getting very large pimples and boils all over my face_ chin_ jaw line_ forehead and neck.

During my first week on this pill I felt off_ sort of depressed. I assumed it was just some family issues. By week two I was having full on panic attacks and periods of mania_ going from being completely distraught to extremely happy in a few hours.  I was petrified_ I had no idea what was going on and started calling psychiatrists. After a day and a half of the worst_ I realized what was happening and came off of the pill.  It's been four days and I am still having symptoms although there has been a definite improvement.  Not sure if it's just withdrawal from stopping mid month at this point_ but it's been a scary couple of weeks.  Thanks for all your posts.

362, 1, High Blood Pressure,Since_ taking this pill_ I have been on a constant period. I have stuck with it as I was on a different mini pill before this one_ but it made me feel depressed_ and i've never felt depressed in my life. Since taking Micronor I've felt completely better!!! However_ after sticking on the mini pill in total of 9 months_ i I have now settled into a regular pattern of bleeding heavily for the first 5 days followed by 13 days of a dulling down period_ then a one day break before the cycle starts again. This does not make me feel attractive at all!! Nor is my boyfirend very impressed.,I was originally on Cilest the combined pill_ whoich controlled my periods well and I had nearly perfect skin. But due to my nurse saying I had high blood pressure_ I've been told I can only take the Mini pill. I was told that it will take time to settle into a pattern as your body is clearing out. But I seem to be loosing a lot of blood a bit too regulalrly for my liking. But i don't want to give iup in case period free days are just round the corner.

Before Micronor I was takign naproxen(Aleve) and it was causing severe damage to my stomach because I had been taking it for long.  So far I have been pleased with Micronor.  My periods were 5 days but now they last about +12days_ then its gone for 2wks then my period starts again.This is the only down part that I have had.  My dr. warned me about gaining weight because Micronor increases appetite_ I didn't hawe any problems with weight gain. As for my headaches and cramps they are gone.  I still have slight headaches but nothing compared to before_ and my cramps are 10x better. The fact that I dont have to miss or work is great.,F,19,3  months.35 1X D,11/2/2010,Micronor

366, 2, Birth control,I noticed almost immediately bloating which subsided after a few days.Things I have suffered since (and I can't say for sure whether they're from this pill as it has not been proved) are dizziness_ nausea and fatigue - to the extent I took a pregnancy test even though I'd had two periods!  I also am now getting leg cramps_ restless legs at night and severe hair loss.  I have also noticed more hair on my top lip and I get more spots now around my chin and mouth.  I have also had muscle and joint aches_ tearfullness and feeling low_ though not depressed.  All the latter have been about a month after taking.  I also suffer constantly from an upset stomach for about a month now.  Breast lumps have appeared.,My periods have remained the same cycle length_ but the period itself lasts almost a whole week and sometimes it is clotty with a heavy first two days.,F,30,3  months 1X D,10/18/2010,Micronor

Rare abdominal pain.,I started taking this for extremely heavy periods_ terrible insomnia that followed by hormonal cycle_ no libido. Despite the side effects above_ I feel much more emotionally stable. The lack of motivation has lifted and I am tired but motivated! I sleep the deepest I have in years with no sleeping pills but still wake up tired. I tried regular bcp's first & bled for 22 days straight than never had a period after the pack ended. Just finished my first month on these and period has lasted over a week but was not super heavy and is easing.

368, 4, Headaches,Irritability_ mood swings_ fatigue_ horrible PMS_ breast tenderness.,I had been on TriCyclen Lo for about four or five years before Micronor. I began having extremely irregular periods_ lasting 14 days_ that were two weeks apart. Having a period this long and this often is taxing on a person physically and mentally and I'm prone to headaches. The NP switched me to Micronor. Going into the 2nd month_ I began feeling very tired. I had also just started a new job and I'm sure that contributed as well. I was hesitant to blame the birth control. However_ after adjusting to my job I still felt tired all the time (even after a restful_ uninterrupted sleep)_ was very irritable_ and was pretty moody. I went to the clinic at about 4 months of being on Micronor. My NP said it could be the pill_ but she wanted to test for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. I take a multivitamin but low and behold_ my urine analysis showed a serious magnesium deficiency. The NP recommended a 420mg magnesium oxide supplement daily as well. It's been a month and my breast tenderness has disappeared(they were sore ALL month before) I also feel more energetic_ but it will take time to get back to my original energy level. I've had one period since with minimal PMS symptoms; I was so sick of being a crying/angry mess at my period. To all ladies having adverse symptoms: get tested for deficiencies. It's sometimes unknown that the pill can deplete vitamins and minerals (especially at period time). While some symptoms are technically caused by the pill_ they can also be remedied.,F,26,5  months0.35 mg 1X D,10/8/2010Email,Micronor

I come from a hairy ancestry (Scottish)_ so I've always had dark hair on my upper lip_ but I now look like Tom Sellek if I don't wax my lip every 2nd week!  I also now have to tweeze my chin!  Aside from that_ I actually found this increased my ability to put on lean muscle mass_ which is important for me as a body builder.  The change in cycles I would attribute to changing my diet and training in the off-season_ as well as any weight that I have gained.  For the most part_ I really like this one_ and not having a period doesn't faze me at all.  I also don't find I have to take it the same time every day - as long as it's within 3 hours (of my usual 9pm timing)_ I'm not affected.,F,26,1  years 1X D,10/8/2010Email,Micronor

My period seems to get lighter a couple hours before I have to take the pill but then a couple hours after I take it_ I'm bleeding heavy again. I don't see the ""good"" in getting a period for a month then no period for 7 months. Your body is supposed to have a period.

I get nervous when I go in there because they always give me a hard time_ so when the check my blood pressure it's always elevated (even though I brought in a note from my primary doctor saying that my blood pressure was perfectly normal). I've been on it since mid July and have had absolutely no periods. I have also noticed a slight weight gain although I work 2 jobs and am constantly on my feet.

377, 1, birth control,Until recently_ I would have said this was great birth control. This was the first BC I've ever taken. I chose it because I didn't want the health risks of combined estrogen pills_ especially since there's a history of reproductive cancer in my family.  I will say that the first 6 weeks or so were a little rough -- breast tenderness; sometimes felt a littel nauseous - but on the whole not bad. (And I knew to expect that any hormonal pill would cause some changes). After that - it was great. I didn't experience any of the mood swings that others have reported. I really think for this pill to work_ you have to take it at the exact time every day (within a 10 minute window). That said_ I'm stopping it because it recently started causing significant hair loss -- 80+ hairs after every shower. What I didn't realize is that if you have ANY kind of family history of thinning hair_ you shouldn't take ANY kind of hormonal birth control (per the recommendation of the American Hairloss Association,,F,29,7  months35 1X D,9/17/2010,Micronor

Some months i would have the worst cramps in my body but just a little spotting_ but no cramps and you would think some one has cut me open_ I would have blood clots that were so bad that i would soke a pad and a tampon in and hour_ and they would be the super plus_ pad and tampons.

I had black circles under my eyes like I have never seen and I looked like I had aged 50 years overnight. I also felt like I was on a constant caffeine rush and I could not sleep a wink,All of the above disappeared within two days of ceasing to take micronor_ however the withdrawal bleeding is heavy and painful.I would not recommend this product under any circumstances_ I have taken other bcp since the age of twenty and have never suffered such side effects to this extent.,F,35,7  days350microgr 1X D,8/26/2010,Micronor

Now my biggest issue is the constant hunger and nothing satisfies my appetite.  I am literally starving all day long.  At first I did bleed irregularly but now I am back on track 2 1/2 months in.

You have to take it at EXACTLY the same time every day. eg. I take it at 8:59am precisely. (An alarm on my phone reminds me.) For the first few months I was taking it within the 3 hour time window_ but not usually at the same time each day. I had very little sex drive and didn't feel too great as a result. I'd bleed for about two weeks out of every month_ at random times. 9 days on_ 4 days off_ 3 days on_ 7 days off_ 13 days on_ 5 days off_ .... Now I'm taking it on time each day and my sex drive is back to normal. All bleeding has stopped. As a test_ I took the pill erratically (as I used to) for a couple of days. And lo and behold_ I started bleeding and felt awful. So take the pill AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME. You've been told!,F,20,7  months 1X D,8/10/2010,Micronor

I will admit_ the first couple of weeks_ there was heavy spotting_ but it lessened the cramps_ and it has also been easier to drop weight. I was emotional_ but I am very sensitive to hormones and just got over it. I think if you are sensitive to estrogen_ and are unhappy with the weight gain from Depo_ this may be something to consider. I see that most woman aren't crazy about this pill_ but sadly_ that is the risk with hormones.,F,21,1  months 1X D,8/4/2010,Micronor

I don't want to be the girl that blames any issues on my birth control but I was working out and dieting and felt motivated to lose weight and actually was at a 12 pound weight loss then I started taking Micronor and have gained 10 of those pounds back. Lack of motivation and just generally being unhappy. EVERYTHING sounds delicious. After reading a lot of women having the same issues that are apparently ""rare""_ according to the side effects_ I am going to quit taking this pill and just be abstinent until I figure out something new.

Ive taken about a hundred pregnancy tests and they are all negative. I dont really like not having my period because it makes me anxious. Other side effects do include mood swings like intense anger at innappropriate times and sadness as well. I still have a pretty active sex life but more often then not I feel like it is another chore I have to get through (lame.) I have also noticed that I break out more around my neck and hairline_ I havent had acne since I was sixteen.

408, 1, clear up acne,increased appetite_ non-existent sex drive_ worsened acne,I have been taking Micronor for exactly two weeks and I immediately felt and saw a difference. A HORRIBLE DIFFERENCE!!! I was prescribed Micronor because I have high blood pressure and my purpose for taking BC was to clear up my skin. It totally did the complete opposite of that!!! I have literally woken up to a new planet on my face every morning. Now I have clusters of pimples on each cheek and chin! I even began to break out on areas of my face that I have never broken out before. There are also a few on my temples and a couple on my forehead. These aren't just little white heads and black heads they are full on cysts aka planets!! My skin feels soo irritated. Mind you_ I use gentle facial cleansers_ moisturize sufficiently_ regularly exercise_ healthy diet and I stay hydrated everyday!!! Save yourself the stress and frustration by NOT using these pills to clear your skin. If you have near to perfect skin or are just suffering from minor breakouts DO NOT use this_ unless you want to murder your face and acquire the appetite of a mountain man.

409, 1, High Blood Pressure,Mood swings_ weight gain_ killed sex drive_ no period_ decrease in breast size,Well_ I'll be going to see my doc on Tues. We're military so my doc changes enough that I don't have the consistency of going to the same person. I was prescribed this bc in Jan because I had high blood pressure (not scary high but elevated) even though it was just just before we had a major move. Once we got here and settled my blood pressure dropped but for all I know it could have been the change in bc. I can't really know now. My mood swings have been nuts_ all over the place and I can't seem to make sense of them. I've been trying to lose some weight (aiming for about 10 vanity pounds) but have gone up 22 pounds since Jan. This is with a job where I'm on my feet all day and working my butt off and taking in between 1100 and 1250 calories a day. (I food journal_ and my doc suggested aiming for 1180 p/day) As well as working out consistently mon-sat for between 1-1.5 hours a day.  I have always had a super high sex drive and within a week of this pill I just don't want it and it hurts when we do have sex. I'm now going on 3 months without a period_ so in the past 6 months I've had 2. I think this should be considered a side effect. I see women on this site talking about how great that is_ but that's not supposed to happen. If it does and you want that_ great. However if not then should be listed as a side effect. Then lastly_ despite gaining weight I have lost almost a full cup size.

Plus_ SEVERE mood swings_ anger_ irritability_ and spontaneous crying. One moment I am furious for no reason_ then I am crying for no reason_ and sometimes I feel so angry I am crying. It is ridiculous! I've also experienced a severely decreased sex drive and NO Sexual Gratification (Cannot Orgasm!!!) It is actually causing problems in my relationship because my boyfriend either blames himself or thinks my feelings for him have changed. I love him so much and my constant mood swings_ depression_ and lack of sexual anything are tearing us apart! I've tried many different kinds of bc and none of them work for me!

It has helped to the point that my periods are only 3-4 days as opposed to 6-7... BUT they are extremely painful if and heavy... not to mention my cycles have gone from being a regular 28-30 days down to 23 days every month and that sucks.

I have one day of crying/moodiness and cramps just before a bleeding episode begins.,I went on Micronor because of severe anxiety and pre-syncopal (almost passing out) episodes before my periods while taking normal birth control (tried about every one on the market). When my doctor assessed my symptoms_ I seemed VERY estrogen dominant so taking a BCP with estrogen was ridiculous. By placing me on this progesterone-only pill - my horrible symptoms are nearly gone. The side effects I will happily deal with since I traded my passing-out/sinking feelings for food cravings - much rather find good foods to indulge in than feel like I'm dying! No weight gain for me - in fact I'm continuing to lose weight since I'm finally feeling well and putting effort into my nutrition!,F,24,4  months 1X D,3/9/2010,Micronor
426, 1, To increase my libido,I had been to the doctors to ask what pill would increase my libido as my sex drive has been rather low for the last few months and I thought it was because of the Ovranette pill I was taking.I started taking Micronor last Tuesday_ and when I came home from work that day_ my fiance asked if I was ok_ and I said 'no' bursting in to tears_ for no reason at all. For the last week_ I have been crying at randoms time_ feeling really panicked_ lonely_ and like something awful is going to happen to my fiance or to my family. I have been very moody and don't feel in control of my body.  I have had to have the last 3 days off work as I have been too emotional. I saw my doctor again last night and he has told me to stop taking it_ even though I had stopped taking it two days ago. I just can't wait for the pills to leave my system.  This has honestly been one of the worst experiences if my life_ don't EVER take this pill!  Ok it may suit some people_ but I would definitely recommend steering cl,,F,24,6  days 1X D,3/3/2010,Micronor
427, 4, Birth Control,Slight weight gain,I have migraines so this was the only thing I could take. I have never taken anything before in my life_ so I have nothing to compare.  It has worked great for me and I will continue to use it until I get a Mirena. While not thrilled about the weight gain_ that can come off once I am off the pill. I've never had any spotting or additional bleeding. My periods are less than 2 days_ but that also can be attributed to my age and nearing menopause. I've had zero side effects - other than the weight gain. It's been perfect for me and my bf_ as our time together is very limited due to it being a ldr.,F,49,6  monthsstandard 1X D,3/2/2010,Micronor
428, 3, Birth Control,ACNE_ irregular periods,My doctor recommended the micronor mini pill because combination pills were giving me high blood pressure. It was working well for the first few months_ but the irregular periods really freak me out. Sometimes I won't get one_ sometimes it just lasts a few days and rarely it is normal. I don't bleed normal blood either_ it is always brown. The WORST part about this pill is the acne. It has gradually gotten worse the longer I have taken it. It is mostly on my chin and the sides of my face. They appear to be small_ almost like a blackhead but not. Over time_ the little small clogged pores will eventually turn into regular nasty pimples that are really hard to pop and I end up with scars. I also have had a lot of acne on my back.,F,20,6  months 1X D,2/25/2010,Micronor

430, 4, birth control,shorter_ lighter periods_ long delays between periods. some abdominal pain but nothing too intense...perhaps a little vaginal dryness.,the main reason why i would stop taking micronor is if my periods went away completely_ i dont like the idea of that. but so far my periods still come_ maybe they might be a little longer between but i like knowing im not pregnant and bleeding to me seems healthy. other than that its a great pill for people who have problems with estrogen. i used to get chronic yeast infections on the combined pill and i have had none of that while on micronor.,F,22,8  months 1X D,2/15/2010,Micronor
431, 1, to stop bleeding,Bad weight gain_ headaches_ still bleeding,in the last 4 months of me taking this pill I have but on 15lbs!  I have had no major diet change and still can not keep the weight from coming on.  I am hungry ALL the time_ and the bleeding that this is pill was going to help... is not helping at all.  My periods are still all over the place and long!  Some days they are heavy and other days they are light.  One minute I'm not bleeding the next I have a heavy flow.  I am stoping this pill.

432, 1, birth control_ endometriosis,Constant spotting_ nearly constant headaches_ migraines have recurred_ fatigue_ apathy_ hair loss,Just finished pill pack yesterday_ will not refill. 3 pill packs is long enough for my body to adjust if it was going to. Bled all but 14 out of 84 days. Frequent headaches_ sometimes for weeks on end. Was migraine free for years before taking this med. The migraines have returned with a vengeance and are now random because my cycle has no pattern. Very sore breasts. Feel like a ghost. Blood loss and migraines will do that to a person. Minor symptoms of endometriosis were much less bothersome than the side effects of this med.  Will have to seek a completely hormone free form of contraception.,F,45,84  days.35 mg 1X D,2/14/2010,Micronor
433, 1, Leiden Factor V (Clotting disorder),Irritability_ Loss of Motivation_ Weight gain,"I am a medical professional myself.  I decided to go on to Micronor because it is safe birth control given my clotting disorder.  Over the 3 months that I was on it_ I became irritable_ gained 10 pounds_ and lost motivation to particpate in life.  Even the smallest task seemed like a mountain to climb.  I was so hungry all the time_ even if I just ate (which is unlike me).  I snapped at people (usually I am very sweet)_ didn't feel like going out into the world and didn't feel like being around my husband (and I Love him so dearly).  And my breasts were SOOO painful - not just tender_ but PAINFUL.  I thought I was going crazy_ literally_ but finally put it all together.  I know everyone reacts differently_ but this medication was not for me.  If you have a history of anxiety or depression_ I would think twice about this medication.  I quit taking Micronor and over the next few days_ it was as if a veil was being lifted from me.  Most of the symptoms have gone away and I can't believe I let it go on like that for 3 months!  I only hope the weight will come off.  It is frustrating that the labeling information says nothing of these potential side effects.  In fact_ weight gain is listed as ""rare"".  This begs the question_ then why are so many women reporting these side effects???  There seems to be a huge discrepancy!!!",F,33,3  months 1X D,2/10/2010,Micronor

Periods can be irregular.,No weight gain_ infact lost over half a stone. No spots. No headaches. Periods lighter and hardly any PMS any more_ no period pains. Periods are sometimes a little irregular though. Sex drive not affected at all.

437, 1, bIRTH CONTROL WHILE BREAST FEEDING,Heavy spotting_ Bleeding to the point of being admitted to emergency_ hallucinations_ mood swings_ anxiety_ neurosis.,I was prescribed this drug_ and I went from having slight baby blues to a complete change of personality. I saw hallucinations_ lived in terror of something harming my baby_ was unable to leave my house because I was afraid my baby would die_ was unable to sleep_ experienced terrifying rages complete with loss of memory. I fainted several times_ assaulted my husband and would cry hopelessly for hours at a time a few times a day. Was subjected to psyche evaluation and found to be completely normal.Eventually I bled so much that I had to go to emergency (blacking out_ unable to walk very well) where the doctor told me to stop taking the pill immediately. 2 days after ceasing the pill the bleeding is almost gone_ the panic and anxiety is gone_ and I have not cried in two days. I am enjoying my baby and my life! Hoping i can lose some baby weight now!,F,29,7  weeks,1/20/2010,Micronor

I would have periods all over the place: 3 days off_ 10 days on_ 5 days off_ 8 days on_ and so on. Longest period was 13 days long. Always had scattered spotting & never knew what to expect -threw out tons of underwear. So_ I went off Micronor after 1.5 years of being on it_ and then I gained 20 lbs in 4 months.

For the past 6 months I've started migraines with auras AGAIN after being free of them for almost 3 1/2 years! Going to see my GP_ but hopefully it is not caused by Micronor.,F,29,4  years,1/4/2010,Micronor
442, 1, painful cramps_ extreme bloating,SEVERE hair loss! My doctor told me to start taking this the day my period started. The next day my period stopped and I lost a ton of hair. I stopped taking this after ONE pill and now 2 months later_ about 60% of my hair is gone (thinned all around the crown) and now I have androgenic alopecia & severe anxiety and depression from the hair loss that happened so fast. Before this stupid pill_ I had clear skin and silky smooth/medium fine hair and now the texture has completely changed to this awful dry/brittle feeling and it's baby fine. My skin went from oily to extemely dry all over and my cycles have been messed up since. I wish I never took this horrible pill.,Worst pill ever!,F,29,1  days,1/2/2010,Micronor

I've always had a healthy sex drive_ nothing since I started on this pill!  That was about 2 weeks postpartum....my poor fiance :(.  Even though as a new mother_ breastfeeding_ etc can also decrease your libido...this is not normal! I am so happy one second_ then hateful and angry the next.  My fiance always bears the brunt of it...the poor guy tries so hard_ works constantly_ and does every thing I ask him to.  I think he's starting to fear me-i've been so nasty!  I don't know what it is_ but I think it's this damn pill! I've going off of it immediately. Hopefully my sex life and personality will bounce back.

I have previously reacted very badly to the combined pill (moody and anxious) and having  taken micronor for a week I've had the same symptoms again_ only worse. Up to now I've taken being a new mum in my stride and have been getting on fine_ but since starting on micronor I've been very weepy_ moody and irrational so I've decided to come off it straight away for the sake of my baby and husband! I've also been experiencing mild nausea_ insomnia and dizzyness - definitely not what you want when you've got a young baby to look after.,,F,30,7  days,12/8/2009,Micronor

Not to mention_ I haven't been sleeping well and neither has my baby_ I think the hormones pass right to her.

It is possible that a number of these symptoms can be attributed to getting my period back_ but I am not willing to take any chances and am coming off this pill.  The thought of getting pregnant again any time soon is a nightmare_ but sex is very important to me so it will be careful use of condoms for now and possibly consider the non hormone IUD.,F,36,7  days,10/24/2009,Micronor

459, 1, Contraception,Severe hair loss,I have been taking Micronor for 3 weeks and after a few days I noticed a fair bit of hair coming out while combing my hair after a shower. As the days went by_ more hair started to come away. I thought that it may be stress_ but figured_ sure I am stressed_ but I have been more stressed at other periods in my life and not had this happen. Then I realised it was Micronor and stopped taking it immediately. My hair is now more fine than it was before_ and I feel upset that I have ruined my hair for the sake of better and safer sex. We all react differently to the pill_ for some this pill may be ok. But I would say if you do experience hair loss_ stop taking it immediately.,F,23,3  weeks,10/9/2009,Micronor
460, 1, Birth control while breastfeeding,Major depression_ weight gain_ acne_ no sex drive.,I wish I found this site earlier - like others have said!  I started this pill after my 6 week gyno from giving birth to my son.  THEN_ I had all the negative side effects listed by others: MASSSIVE depression (to the point of thinking death would be easier -- even knowing that was crazy_ since my son is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen)_ lost NO weight while breastfeeding (even while walking 2 miles a day)_ NO sex drive (and painful sex) and facial acne/discoloration.  I'm stopping today_ 3 months in.  At first I thought it was my hypothyroidism_ but had my levels checked and they were fine.  I was about to go to the doctor PPD_ because I couldn't explain my mood change -- I'm 39 and know myself pretty well. My only question with PPD_ was why it would have started so late.  I never thought of the micronor (I'm on the generic jolivette)_ because I took the regular estrgen pill for years with no problems. I'm off this pill! I'd rather be pregnant than fat and divorced. Watch your anger and depression levels if you decide to stay on this pill.,F,39,3  months,10/4/2009,Micronor
461, 5, combo pills cause migraines,It took about 3 months for my body to fully adjust to Micronor.  The first week I had headaches (not migraines though like I get on the regular pill).  The second week the headache went away and I had 7-10 days of bloating.  Then I was kind of depressed for a couple of weeks_ but that went away.,I've had one period (long_ 10 days) and one round of break through bleeding (4 days).  The period was about 6 weeks into taking Micronor.  I haven't had another since_ which is fine by me.  I have horrible pms so no periods for me is a good thing :-)  Once the initial side affects disappeared and my body adjusted_ I've felt fine on these.   I had nothing but problems with combo pills so was thrilled to find a pill that doesn't make me miserable.,F,41,5  months,9/29/2009,Micronor

463, 2, Contraception while breastfeeding.,Weight gain_ random periods and spotting_ bloating_ mood swings_ acne_ increased sex drive.,My doc prescribed Micronor to me when I told him I'd like to be on the pill but continue breastfeeding my daughter.  I've never had problems with weight_ acne_ or irregular periods in my life_ but thanks to Micronor_ now I have.  I'm still the same weight as when I left the hospital after giving birth to my daughter (8 months ago).  I could go to the gym 24/7 and eat nothing but iceberg lettuce and I probably still wouldn't lose any weight.  Now I have a period every 2 or 3 months just randomly when I used to know down to the hour when my period would come because it was so regular.  And my face?  It looks like pepperoni pizza.  Seriously.  I've been on Micronor for 6 months and that was 6 months too much.  I'll miss the wicked sex drive however... and so will my hubby.,F,22,6  months,9/12/2009,Micronor
464, 1, Birth Control,Extreme mood swings_ anxiety_ severe breast tenderness_ weight gain_ mild headaches.,I've been on BC since I was 19 yrs old & this is BY FAR the worst pill I have ever taken.  In just 25 days_ I've managed to gain 6 lbs_ despite eating healthy & working out 5-6 days a week.  I'm hungry ALL the time.  The breast tenderness was so severe that I would be in tears at time_ particularly when working out.  And by far_ the worst part has been the extreme mood swings and anxiety.  I went from being happy and loving life to having extreme highs and lows-more lows though than anything.  Feeling intense rage one moment and sobbing the next.  Worrying about absolutely nothing.  Feeling this general numbness about my life and just wanting to be alone all the time.  This pill was making me crazy-I literally felt like I was becoming psychotic on it!  Thank goodness I experienced negative side effects on BC before_ so I was in tune to these changes I was having and put two and two together rather quickly-before I started sabatoging all of my personal and professional relationships.  I am done with this pill and will never use another hormonal method of BC again.  At this point_ I'd rather be pregnant than spend another day feeling like I have for the past 25!!,F,34,25  days,9/10/2009,Micronor

I've been on this specific pill for about a year now_ and the mood swings have lessened_ but the hair loss and the spotting haven't. (I have thick hair so I haven't noticed it missing I just see a lot come out in the shower) I've had the crazy mood swings on other birth controls as well. They defiantly became more mild after time. And I've also noticed that I spot more when I smoke cigarettes.,F,23,1  years,9/9/2009,Micronor

I would think I was going crazy if it wasn't for having come across this site.  There are none of these things mentioned as 'possible side effects' on the papers I received from my pharmacist.,I'm normally a happy person with an easy laugh that loves her family and appreciates the good things in life.  I've just realized that it's been since I've been on this pill that I feel 'doomed'_ inadequate_ useless.  I want to argue with my husband and I have no patience for mildly 'challenging' issues in my life that I would normally consider minor irritants.  Everything is just making me want to cry.,F,38,3  weeks,9/5/2009,Micronor
468, 2, control migraines,"Since March 2009 I have been on Micronor to lessen the chances of getting any more migraines.  The reason for changing from a combo pill to the mini pill was because I have to controll my periods due to endometriosis.  I have not had a period since Dec 2008!  Since changing pills I have gained 15-20 pounds.  I started Weight Watchers in May and have gained 12 pounds just since then!  I have had the testing done for my thyroid and everything is ""normal"".  I am heading to the Gyno to weigh my options because this is absolutely NUTS!  If I keep on doing this_ I will be 300 pounds before I know it!  I would rather have a hysterectomy than weigh what I do just because of a pill!",Gyno said that my weight gain was NOT due to the Micronor_ I disagree based on the ratings on this site!!!,F,35,5  months,8/29/2009Email,Micronor
469, 3, Birth Control,No period as yet_ Nausea_ Hot Sweats,I was prescribed Micronor because of my age_ I haven't had a period as yet_ which is okay_ I had the nausea for about three weeks and did a pregnancy test_ all ok. I have been having Hot Sweats which last a few minutes and are continual_ so I am not getting much sleep waking up in pools of sweat through the night.  I haven't had any weight gain but I do exercise regularly.,F,43,12  weeks,8/26/2009,Micronor
470, 3, problems with estrogen,the side effects havent been too bad actually.  at first i spotting a lot and it was very frustrating but just when i was about to give up it stopped.  i dont like the idea of not having a period_ but ive been on it for 4 months now an i still get my period around every 4-5 weeks. its is pretty light_ but as long as i'm getting it i'll be ok.,i started taking this pill because the combo pill was giving me chronic yeast infections and the doc suspected it might be the estrogen.  she was probably right because after i went off of bcp they went away and then i tried micronor a few months later.the only problem i have with this pill is if my periods stop i dont think i'll take it anymore though. not only is it nerve racking but it doesnt feel healthy.  my doc has already told me that its fine_ and being on the pill you never have a real period anyway and all of that but i dont like the idea.  im pretty worried that being on any birth control will screw up my fertility for the future though.,F,22,4  months,8/18/2009,Micronor
471, 3, Breastfeeding,Hair loss_ dizzyness_ stomach aches,Some will say that the hair loss is contributed to having a baby but my hair loss became severe 3 weeks into my first pack. I am breastfeeding and I was 8 weeks post delivery when it became severe.(hair loss) I've also experienced dizzyness which hasn't been to bad to handle. The other thing I don't like is having to take it at the same time every day and worrying about that 2hour window! I'm satisfied overall but I will switch as soon as I stop breastfeeding.,F,27,12  weeks,8/16/2009,Micronor
472, 1, Breastfeeding,Nausea_ acne_ hairloss_ no sex drive_ period every other week_ depression_ very tired all day_ irritable_ hungry_ bloated to the point where you feel pregnant_ breast tenderness_ sensitivity (always want to cry),I have been on the pill for only two packs. I will start another pack next week. In the beginning I was severly nausea_ and had breakthrough bleeding. I now have all of the other listed side effects. When I am done breastfeeding I will look for another form of bc. Also_ I have had my period for two weeks now.,F,25,2  months,8/10/2009Email,Micronor
473, 2, can't take estrogen,moodiness_ severe cramping_ no periods since I started it_ crying spells_ fatigue_ nausea,It was perfect when I was breastfeeding my daughter 4 years ago_ but I was on antidepressants for PPD at the time too_ which probably masked the side effects I have now. I tried Ortho Lo but got tired of feeling so lousy and fat all the time_ so went to the NuvaRing for a relief from my periods. Didn't have a period for a year_ (great!) but I was also very mean and confrontational to people around me. I was not my normal quiet calm self. Stopped that and decided to go back to this one_ but it has been a kind of hell since I started not knowing if I am pregnant because I never get my period_ crying through bouts of cramping that send me to the ER at night_ moodiness and crying spells that last for days. I used to be such a happy mother_ and now I am a trainwreck since I started this pill. I was in the ER just last night in so much pain I couldn't walk. I am glad that I found this website because now I know I am not crazy.,F,32,3  months,8/7/2009,Micronor
474, 1, Contraception,VERY VERY severe stomach aches_ dizziness a constant period for a month_ clotting_ depression,I've been on micranor for 3 months after asking to be put on the new pro pill with a 12 hour le-way as opposed to a 2 hour le-way_ my doctor put me on micranor which was the wrong one. i had a period the 1st week i was on it_ thinking this was just my body getting used to new pill after 6 years i carried on taking it. i went on holiday and 2 days before i returned home i began another period_ which has not yet stopped and i returned a month ago. i have had very very severe stomach aches_ which have kept me up all night_ and left me struggling to concentrate at work and at home. i am extremely bloated and look about 2 months pregnant. my mood got very bad and i felt like giving up_ leading to very bad arguments between me and my partner. i went to the doctor and they gave their sincerest apologies for the mix up of putting me on the wrong pill_ i am now on cerezette and have been for 4 days..my stomach pains seem to have calmed but not disapeared all together_ however i am still having a period although not as heavy as it has been for the past month and my mood has got a lot lot better in the short time i have been on this new pill! i would NOT recommend micranor to anyone wanting a contraceptive pill because aside from the constant bleeding all the other side affects put together make it the WORST pill i have ever had out of both combined and pro pills!,F,21,3  months,7/30/2009Email,Micronor
475, 1, birth control,severe abdominal pain_ dizziness_ heavy bleeding_ early period_ ER visit.,I went to the doctor to get a new prescription for my combined birth control. He told my blood pressure (120/80) and told me it was too high for me to continue on my old birth control. He prescribed Micronor even though I faught him on it cause I know 120/80 is not high blood pressure. A couple days after taking it my nipples got very sore and my lower abdomin got very tender to the touch and intercourse was painful. Two weeks after taking it one day I was cleaning and got sudden severe abdominal pain. Worst pain of my life. Went the the emergency room and they concluded it was Micronor causing the pain. I was in the worst pain of my life for 4 days and then had the heaviest bleeding I've ever had. I'm never taking that pill again!!,F,19,2  weeks,7/30/2009,Micronor
476, 1, Blood Clots,Weight gain_ bloat_ moodiness_ no sex drive AT ALL,"I recently got off of this pill (3 days ago) and now that I have read the other reviews I dont feel crazy! I have gained 10-12 pounds in the past 9 months (even though I am fairly active and have a pretty healthy diet). I constantly had a ""foggy"" mood and didnt feel any joy with anything in my life.The lack of sex drive was starting to effect my marriage. I can barely wear my wedding ring somedays because my fingers and body are always so puffy/swollen. I cannot wait for this drug to work its way out of my system and get back to my old self. If you are sensitive about weight gain at all I would stay away from this pill ",F,34,9  months,7/29/2009,Micronor

478, 1, Birth Control_ Painful Periods/PMS,Wow!  I'm glad I found this site as I was starting to feel like something was wrong. Even my closest friends were beginning to wonder what was wrong and then I mentioned that I just went on the pill. I have only been on this for 18 days and I've experienced tenderness in my breasts_ extreme moodiness_ irritability_ vaginal dryness during sex and tingling sensations that go up my arms.,I've decided to go off this immediately as I would rather deal with the painful periods every few months than the moodiness I've been experiencing during the last few weeks.,F,37,18  days,6/29/2009,Micronor

I had lost 20 lbs after giving birth and I have gained 20 ibs back in the last 6 months..  i attributed it to stopping breastfeeding and being older with this pregnancy..I feel horrible about myself I have never been this big_ am the same weight as I was 9 months pregnant with both my daughters (14 years apart)  I am having extreme rage issues_ never felt like this in my life_ honestly think I am going crazy_ scared of myself and scared of what I could do..not cool.  I've been  going to counselling and everything (good anyway) And the bloating all the time_ looks like I'm 5 months pregnant all the time.  I cant even fit my pregnant clothes ;(  Thank God I found this site...quitting tonight!! ...........

481, 1, birth control,WEIGHT GAIN (6lbs in half a month while on STRICT diet and intense workouts of high intensity aerobics classes 4x a week and the P90X program)_ extreme irritability_ depression_ bloating,"My ""doctor"" must be a dumb*ss when she put me on these pills after i told her how much I struggle with my weight loss after finally breaking a 2 year old plateau after losing 150 pounds so far~ she told me that as long as I fight cravings I would not gain weight (bs!) on these and I HAVE!!! I'm more strict on my diet and exercise programs than anything and managed to magically gain 6 pounds in 14 days. I was actually steadily LOSING weight before I took these pills~ and they've completely reversed what i had going! All my hard work and gym time! Not only that~ but i read these other ratings by everybody else and at least every other one has weight gain! So I know it's not just me~  Not only that~ but on top of the devastating news of gaining weight that i live to get rid of I have to deal with feeling like I'm on constant hardcore PMS. I feel pissed off all the time and can't enjoy any fun outings anymore. I'm too busy feeling like I have to kill something. The increased depression also does not help me when i'm already extremely upset about this weight gain. Not to mention~ on top of everything else~ I'm all the time bloated! My doctor was obese~ she was probably jealous of my weight loss and gave me these pills as REVENGE!! f***ing cruel!!!",F,18,15  days,6/17/2009Email,Micronor
482, 5, Can't take estrogen,"No ""real"" period since month 5 (2006!!) Also minor_ light breakthrough bleeding very rarely (like_ 1 pantyliner/day kinda' light only lasting 1-2 days)","I have been on Micronor for over 3 years_ and I LOVE IT. I have high blood pressure and migraines with aura; I am unable to take Estrogen as this intensifies the migraines AND the blood presure. I learned this the hard way 5 years ago when my doctor prescribed a regular combi-pill and I nearly ended up at the hospital with a severe migraine that bordered on a TIA.  He then told me I couldn't EVER take oral contraceptives again_ too risky_ and no implants or injections_ either. HUH?! Second opinion_ please! Sure enough_ I went to see a specialist_ and after telling him my history and having an examination_ he wrote me the scrip for Micronor_ smiled and said ""stick with this one kiddo_ you'll be glad you did..."" And he was SO right!! My periods were A W F U L. Huge clots_ terrible cramping and crippling fatigue for 8-14 days EVERY MONTH. This has been a miracle drug for me!! No period is not an issue with THIS girl! :) I researched it obsessively in the beginning_ thinking that not having a monthly was just all wrong_ but if you take the drug as it's prescribed_ GENERALLY SPEAKING it seems that it is not unusual to lose your period altogether within 5-12 months. I seem to have been lucky - no side effects at all_ except for a few months of a very light_ very strange coloured period...and then it DISAPPEARED altogether!!!

483, 3, History of ocular migraines,Not entirely sure.  Definitely sore breasts and vaginal dryness.  Probably weight gain.  Possibly moodiness (mostly sadness_ a little anger early on_ which I seem to have gotten under control).,I've had some emotional things_ but none seem entirely random (cried at a TV show about someone losing a baby_ but I had a friend lose a baby a few months ago).  Was having some anger_ but realized I was being unreasonable and have mostly gotten past that.  Sex drive went down a little_ but boyfriend was in an emotional slump and was having his own sex drive issues (also causing some of my anxiety)_ plus I've never been WAY up there in sex drive.  Point being_ I COULD attribute these things to the pill_ but wouldn't necessarily.  I started to notice a trend of women who were breastfeeding (and presumably recently given birth) with a lot of the above issues_ and I'm now wondering if there's any possibility they're more related to post-partum?  Or people under other stress_ which also historically causes the above issues in me.So I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on that.  So far_ I'm reserving judgment.  I haven't had spotting so far_ and haven't reached the time for my 2nd period yet (first one was normal).  So hopefully it will stay that way.  I'm improving my eating habits and re-committing to regular exercise immediately -- if I don't lose weight or continue to gain_ that might be an issue.  But with my silly handful of ocular migraines (no headaches)_ I'm not sure the doctor will give me a choice_ gr.,F,32,1.5  months,6/14/2009,Micronor
484, 5, birth control,Some random spotting_ slightly longer periods,I love micronor and would recommend it to anyone. I began taking it because my doctor was worried about my history of migraines and never experienced negative side effects except occasional spotting and missed periods. I went off of it for a while and tried other kinds of pills_ none of which I liked and couldn't last more than a few months on. I am now back on micronor and have had no problems; I have lost weight on it_ feel completely emotionally stable_ have not lost my sex drive_ and my periods are still relatively regular. I will never take another kind of pill.,F,24,8  months,6/4/2009,Micronor
485, 1, Non-estrogen birth control,Severe mood swings; heavy_ painful periods every other week; weight gain despite no change in diet or exercise regime; very tender breasts,I'm not pregnant_ but it's hardly surprising with so many periods in the two months I've been taking it!  With all the side-effects and precision required for taking the darned thing_ it's more hassle than it's worth for me.,F,31,2  months,5/27/2009,Micronor
486, 1, prevent endometriosis regrowth,No period_ weight gain_ constant hunger_ severe headaches_ sore breasts_ very emotional,I have only had two periods in the time I have been on this pill; the first was regular_ the second was two weeks late_ and I have not had one in over two months.  I take the pill exactly as directed (I've never missed a dose)_ and I have taken several pregnancy tests because I've been so worried.  I have been under a lot of stress (graduating college and applying to law school)_ so this has supposedly thrown off my cycle further. I am prone to migraines anyway_ and have had one every day for three weeks.  My breasts hurt constantly_ and my appetite is voracious; I'm usually a very light eater.  Combined with the intense mood swings (commercials make me cry)_ even my mother thought I was pregnant.  My doctor told me that these symptoms were normal and to continue taking the pill; the side effects would wear off.  He was wrong.  They have intensified.  I HATE this pill and cannot wait to get off it.,F,23,5  months,5/19/2009,Micronor
487, 3, Birth Control,Irregular periods_ longer periods than normal,I've taken Micronor twice in the last few years. First time for about 3 months_ I had no period when taking it the first time. The second time_ I've now been taking it for 4 months but it's totally different! I have periods about twice a month for about 10 days. I'm getting sick of only have a week every month where I'm not on my period. Fair play_ I haven't got pregnant while taking the pill_ but the fact it alters my menstrual cycle so much is annoying. I'm going to change to another type of pill soon I think.,F,20,4  months,5/4/2009,Micronor
488, 2, Birth Control while on BP Med,Consistant excessive spotting_ weight gain and acne.,I've been on Micronor for the past 2 months which lessen my cramps which I love.

493, 2, Migraines,Missed periods_ longer periods_ weight gain,I was told by a new doctor that I wasn't allowed to take combined bc pills because of my migraines and auras_ even though I had been on combined ones for 3 years and no other doctor has ever mentioned that.  I've had these migraines my whole life_ but I was scared of the 'you're at high risk for stroke' so I switched...and I hate it.  First period was late_ second hasn't come yet_ and its three weeks late (preg. test was negative)...I've also gained about 4-5 pounds over the last month & have been working out_ I now way more than I ever have in my whole life. : (,F,20,2  months,4/22/2009,Micronor
494, 4, Migraines,weight gain (5#)_ missed periods_ possibly emotional distress/depression,I started taking this because I got migraines during my period on the combination pill.  I've always been very thin (even underweight) so the 5 pound weight gain brought me up to a normal weight(something I had been trying to do for 3 years prior to taking this pill_ but with no success)_ I just hope I don't gain too much weight.  I got my period when I started the pill and then again 3 months into it.  I had 2 days of spotting another month and a half after that_ and nothing else since.  The periods I had were much heavier than normal (with no pills and combo I had very very light periods_ with this pill it's about 1 wk with pretty bad cramps on first day)  I was a little worried about possibly being pregnant but feel better after reading this website.  I've been a little emotional the past couple of months_ but I'm also dealing with a lot of stress (senior in college_ taking too many units) and even though I know the weight gain is a good thing_ it's still emotionally difficult to gain weight.,F,21,6  months,4/16/2009,Micronor
495, 4, breast-feeding,increased appetite_ no period_ weight gain?,I have not had a period since having a baby 7.5 months ago.  That kind of makes me nervous_ but as someone else said_ when taken correctly it is reliable. I felt depressed_ like most of the other breast-feeding mothers_ but having a baby does cause a big change in hormones.  If they come off the med and feel better fine_ but if you think about it_ maybe it is PPD?  My depression had NOTHING to do with Micronor. I am having trouble losing my baby weight_ but who knows if it that is even related.  I am starting to get a little acne_ but who knows it could be my period finally coming!  I'm not pregnant_ and any side effects are very mild.  All in all I'd recommend.,F,26,6  months,4/8/2009,Micronor

Just when I thought things were settling down with the mood swings I started getting a constant stream of mini-periods complete with cramps. For a medication that is so picky about how I take it_ this seems to be a lot of hassle.,F,21,45  days,4/6/2009,Micronor
497, 1, Can't take combo pills.,My doctor took me off Ortho-Tryclen Lo because I have had migraines with auras in the past. I was on Micronor 2 1/2 weeks and I started experiencing severe acne. I called my doctor and he said it is the #1 complaint he hears while on this pill yet the package insert states acne is a rare side effect. I stopped taking Micronor 3 days ago after only being on it for 2 months but the acne has to go!!!!,,F,37,2  months,3/21/2009,Micronor

After a year I got it and it was so heavy that I had to go to the ER because I didnt know what was all that HEAVY flow! Ever since then I been getting irregular periods and lots of spotting_ getting dizzy from time to time_ headaches etc. I quit it and right after 3-4 days felt better.

502, 1, Breastfeeding,Pessimism/Depression_ Irritability/Anger_ Mood Swings_ Extreme Hunger_ Fatigue_ Headaches_ Loss of Sex Drive_ Physical Numbness During Sex,I began taking Micronor before Christmas_ when my daughter was about 4 months. Around the end of January I started to loose my sex drive and experienced a loss of sensation during sex. As time passed more symptoms seemed to add on_ and existing symptoms worstened. My husband and I both noticed that I just wasn't the same person anymore. I felt completely detached and thought I was going crazy!!! One day I cried 8 times (I seldom ever cry normally).I thought maybe the sexual issues might be caused by the micronor so I checked this website and_ to my relief_ everything I was having problems with was listed here!Thank God I wasn't going crazy!!!It's been almost a week since I've been off of micronor (switched onto Tri-cyclen lo) and most symptoms are fading fast! I'm still hungry_ but that may fade as well or may be a symptom of the new pill.Thankfully_ the tri-cyclen lo has not changed my breastmilk quality and I think that my milk supply has actually increased!,F,28,3  months,3/17/2009,Micronor
503, 4, Breastfeeding,The only one I seem to have is excessive hunger...,I have only gained 5 pds - but when I started noticing the weight gain and the excessive hunger - I have begun to chew gum to help with that and drink lots of water. Otherwise I am very pleased so far with Micronor. I can't take estrogen anyway - even without breastfeeding - so I will probably contimue to take this pill even after she is a year old.,F,33,1  months,3/12/2009,Micronor
504, 5, Breastfeeding,I have  not had any side effects from Micronor.,I have been taking Micronor (Jolivette) for 8 months now with no issues.  I took the combi-pills before and suffered severe migraines to the point of not functioning and having to use Imitrex to help get rid of them. I also used Depo-Provera before. While I liked not having my period_ I put on 50 pounds on it that has taken me 10 years to completely get rid of. With the Micronor_ I start my period right at the beginning of the new pack each month.  It's a normal period for me_ cramps_ bloating and the blahs_ but NO migraines_ no acne_ no heavy bleeding. I personally reccomend this pill to women who have history of migraines who have used other contraceptives that bring on severe migraines.  The only thing I don't like about this pill is that is it less effective now that I am not breastfeeding anymore.  Other then that_ I am very happy with this choice.,F,29,8  months,3/8/2009,Micronor

506, 2, Migraine Headaches,Weight Gain (10lbs in 2 months - I am extremely active)_ acne_ very irregular periods,I was originally put on this pill after coming off depo-provera.  Depo was only a short term solution for me.  Because I experience migraines w/ aura_ I cannot be on any combination pills.  I experienced weight gain of around 10lbs.  I am extremely active_ regularly train and run 5Ks and mountain bike.  I could not get the weight back off and did not like how it made me feel. I also did not like being unable to predict when (or if) my period would come.  I felt like I had my period every other week.  It became very burdonsome to try to keep up with this.  I have since gone off all hormonal forms of birth control_ and am practicing the Fertility Awareness Method.,F,29,8  months,3/4/2009Email,Micronor

510, 1, Birth Control while Breastfeeding,Severe moodiness/irritability. RAGE!! Angry and miserable all the time. NO sex drive whatsoever. Painful sex/vaginal dryness. Constantly felt overwhelmed with everything in life even simple things that I could easily handle before. Very emotional_ crying all the time. I felt like I was treating my husband and my kids badly and I felt bad about myself all the time. Thoughts of suicide (never EVER had this before). I felt like the people in my life would be better off without me. Weight gain_ hungry all the time. Hair loss.,My doctor recommended this medicine as birth control to use while breastfeeding as my regular birth control was not an option. I ABSOLUTELY would NOT recommend this product to ANYONE!!! I had a TERRIBLE experience with it!!! I have stopped taking this medicine for approximately 2 weeks and I am starting to feel back to my old self again. I was absolutely shocked when I came accross this website and discovered I was not alone with the side effects I was experiencing. I thought I was going CRAZY! I only decided to research the side effects of Micronor after talking to a good friend who had experienced some side effects after starting a new medication (different one)and I was curious to know what side effects were common with Micronor. The night I read the information on this website is the night I stopped taking Micronor and I will NEVER touch it again as long as I live! I only wish I had found this website sooner.,F,35,11  months,2/16/2009,Micronor
511, 5, Never stopped it after weaning,None. That's why I like it so much.,After taking the pill for over four years now_ the doctor asks me every year if I want to switch back to a combo pill (progetin only pills such as micronor ARE slightly less effective than combo pills if you are not EXCLUSIVLEY breast feeding). But I have been on it for four years and no side effects or pregnancy. I love not having a period (or hardly ever having a period.) I usually have a period if I a pill then double up on them too late the next day. But oh well. I see grils whining about how they freak out from not having a period because they don't know if they are pregnant. USUALLY...not always_ if you are taking them totally correctly_ you aren't pregnant. Don't know when you are going to start? carry a stupid tampon with you. What's the big deal. Most of the women I see swearing they are going nuts are usually just making themselvs that way through stress and worry. That will totally mess up your cycle_ hormones_ and everything else worse than any pill will. CHILL OUT!,F,30,4.5  years,2/11/2009Email,Micronor
512, 2, birth control_ estrogen intolerant,irregular bleeding,I can't take anything with estrogen_ because it gives me migraines.  So_ I've tried the progestin-only pill.  It was great for a month and a half_ then I started getting spotting - for the better part of 3 weeks_ then it stopped for about a month_ then started up again about 6 weeks ago - I have bled on and off every other week.  According to my gynocologist this is normal and about 1 in 10 women experience irregular bleeding and there is nothing they can do about it. Am going in to talk to her about it - may either switch to a progestin-only option with a lower dose or try paragard.,F,25,4.5  months,2/4/2009,Micronor
513, 3, birth control while breasfeeding,No sexual drive at all; dryness in the vaginal area; strong PMT-like feeling most of the time (although I am naturally prompt to mood swings). I stopped breastfeeding 3 weeks ago_ so I still don't know if I will have a period this month.,My baby is almost 9 months old and I have breastfeed her for almost 8 months. I started taking Micronor as my GP said that this pill is not counter-indicated for breastfeeding mothers. 3 weeks ago I ran out of milk completely_ but I haven't had a period at all since my baby was born; just very mild brown spotting around 3 weeks ago_ may be coinciding with me stopping breastfeeding. I had been on the combined pill for 3 years prior to taking micronor_ but it did make me very depressed_ especially at the beginning of each set of pills. Micronor doesn't make me feel depress_ but I do feel very irritable and my hair is coming off_ as other people said. I have not sexual drive at all. I would say_ the main advantage for me with this pill is contraception while breastfeeding and not feeling depressed_ but I still need to see if the other symptoms are related to taking it.,F,33,34  weeks,1/28/2009Email,Micronor

515, 3, Birth control,Lost at least 2 inches of hairline_ continuous acne (never a problem before for me)_ loss of sex drive that continued to dimninish_ depression and mood swings_ migraines (which also never had before).,After almost 4 years_ I am just stopping it. I figured out about a year ago the hair loss I was experiencing was most likely from the androgens. And I figured maybe no one has a sex drive with a toddler around. And I was just too scared of getting pregnant (which I still am and will be) but it just isn't worth it anymore. I don't even remember the person I used to be before this pill.,F,30,3.5  years,1/18/2009,Micronor
516, 3, birth control,Im 22 and have taken Ortho tricyclene for 4yrs. I got off last year because of the INTENSE mood swings_ and was put on Micronor. I used it for 1 week and stopped using it. that was in april of 08 and didnt get a period til october 08 and none since then. I used micronor in oct and was diagnosed with depression that month. but with no period_ theres no depression or ANY symptoms for that matter. i dont use this medicine regulary. i havent even completed the first pack i opened a year ago.,I dont have a problem with micronor. i have no periods and no periods for me means no intense mood swings and no depression with thoughts of suicide. if i began taking it on a regular basis and still continued to not have a period_ then i would definatly continue to take it.,F,22,2  times,1/17/2009Email,Micronor
517, 2, birth control/breastfeeding,"Extreme depression_ anxiety_ paranoia_  not just the ""baby blues"".  Several uncontrollable crying jags and a constant overwhelming feeling of worthlessness.  Absolutely no orgasms at all in 3 months; extreme vaginal dryness and a lot of pain during intercourse and after. (Lubrication doesn't seem to help much)  Moderate abdominal bloating_ pain after eating.  Minimal appetite; moderate weight loss.",At 3 weeks postpartum I was all over my husband; couldn't wait to get on the pill so we wouldn't have to worry about pregnancy.  Not worth taking this pill; I rather worry about pregnancy then my irrational fears taking over my mind.  Switching to condoms for now.,F,40,3  months,1/13/2009,Micronor
518, 2, Heavy_ painful periods,Considering why I was taking this pill_ I've had nothing but trouble. The first three of the seven months I took it my period was slightly lighter_ but since then I've been starting another full-blown period within days of finishing the last. They have been just as painful as before - my situation has actually got worse from taking this pill!,The practice nurse I saw for a checkup agreed that by now the side-effects would have disappeared. I am waiting for an appointment to get my prescription changed.,F,21,7  months,12/28/2008,Micronor
519, 2, birth control,I hate this pill!!! Was on Depo shot for 10yrs without any side effects at all. Dr Sugeested I go on the pill to see if it would bring on a period. Since I tarted this pill 3 months ago I have been depressed_ antisocial & miserable in part to the 6lb weight gain & feeling bloated ALL the time. I am an avid runner & work out 5 days a week & eat very healthy so there is No other expination for feeling this way other than this pill...........stopping it today,,F,31,3  months,12/27/2008,Micronor
520, 4, Migraine headaches,Mild acne (which I never had on regular combo pills) and lack of a true period.,"Overall_ I am VERY happy with this pill (I'm on Jolivette). I tried about 4 different low-estrogen pills before this_ and each one gave me horrible migraines_ to the point where I missed work several days a month. My only down-side to this pill (as many people mentioned) is the fact that in 3 months_ I still haven't had a real period_ only light brown spotting. I've taken a pregnancy test each month_ just to be sure! I set my cell phone alarm to remind me to take it each night_ and I've been late a few times_ but no biggie - then my husband and I just abstain or use condoms for a few days_ like the instructions say. I've had mild acne on this_ but mainly just the few days before the ""light brown spotting"" period_ and often when I'm stressed at work! For those of you complaining of depression_ you might want to look further into it before switching pills. If this NON-estrogen pill causes depression_ you'll probably get it even WORSE on a combo-pill_ since estrogen is usually t",F,34,3.5  months,12/11/2008,Micronor
521, 1, blood disorder,I was on the combo pill for 8 years with no issues_ was moved to the mini pill bc of blood clotting isuues and it made me a crazy person.  I am not a moody person but i felt like a ticking time bomb... crying and getting mad all the time.  I lasted 3 weeks and got off.  Within a week I was back to feeling like a normal person.,,F,28,3  weeks,12/4/2008,Micronor
522, 5, Birth Control,After only three weeks_ the depression is out of control.  I was neveer told that this could be a side effect.  I am on the generic Micronor_ Errin but today I am going to stop taking it.  This is ridiculous_ I work out 4-5 days a week_ and have never felt like this before.  I was on Ortho-Trycyclan for over ten years before and never had a problem.  NOt sure what to do now_ since high BP prevents me from taking progestin.  Too many side effects with the other alternatives as well.,,F,34,23  days,12/2/2008,Micronor
523, 1, birth control,Extreme moodiness_ severe depression_ thoughts of suicide_ anxiety_ stressed out and worrying over nothing_ crying all the time_ decreased ability to reach orgasm_ lower sex drive_ acne,EXTREME moodiness - getting mad over nothing_ crying about nothing_ stressing out and worrying about nothing - none of this is like me. My poor bf wanted me to go off the pills and take our chances it was so bad. Depressed and sometimes having suicidal thoughts - I wasn't like this before taking Micronor. Lower sex drive and inability to achieve orgasm most of the time which is also causing problems and frustration in the relationship and was never an issue before. I think I am just going to stop taking them and try to find something else. Maybe Mirena. I was put on Micronor instead of Ortho Tricyclen Lo because of migraines with aura but I just had a migraine with aura 3 days ago. Last period was a week late_ causing stress about pregnancy. I don't need any of these negative side effects. There was also considerable acne before my period started which I also don't want. Periods were either extremely heavy (and causing dizziness all day on day 1) or extremely light. These pills suck..,F,37,3  months,12/1/2008,Micronor
524, 2, Birth Control,I started taking micronor about 4 months ago after being off bcp's for the past 4yrs. I originally went off the bcp in my 39th year (due to my age and being a smoker). I have quit smoking since then_ however have gotten into another relationship where I have had to choose birth control again. The first month of being on this pill was ok_ though did not get a period for the first 2 months. Month 3 I started feeling tenderness in the breasts which now seems to have lasted straight through the past couple of months. I also wake up with pins and needles in my feet_ and feel very restless when I sleep. All of these symptoms could be coincidental_ as I am also going through a very emotional time in my life_ so have been experiencing depression and being very fatigued. Unfortunately_ I am now on day 13 of a period_ and came in here to see what information I could find about taking this pill. I am now thinking about other options for birth control.,,F,43,4  months,11/30/2008,Micronor

I naturally have fine_ thin hair and started losing significant amounts on the top around my face.  I truly believe a lot of it has to do with this medication.  I officially stopped taking it today.

529, 3, birth control,no real side effects. I did get preganant while taking micronor_ but that was my fault for missing one pill.,I first started taking micronor 8 years ago. I had previously been taking tri cyclen then cyclen and I hated them both. My body does not like estrogen pills. Micronor was great the first three years I took it. Then_ I got pregnant. After i was finished nursing_ I didnt go back on it as I wanted to have another baby. Im now done nursing my second child and decided to go back on micronor (after five years). My body is not responding to it at all! Its like Im not even taking a pill. So I just tried yasmin for two months_ horrible_ I hated it. Now Im back to Micronor and its not doing anything. My periods have been the heaviest theyve every been in my life_ Im soaking through super tampons every 30 mins_ now Im anemic_ I dont like estrogen_ Im going to go crazy. I think Id just rather have a hysterectomy :(,F,31,30  days,11/13/2008,Micronor
530, 3, Birth Control_ Progesterone Only,acne_ no period yet,After a year-long battle with a non-existent sex drive_ I finally talked to my gynecologist about it.  I stopped taking Ortho Evra (the patch) because she said it may be because estrogen binds with testosterone (decreasing the amount) which in turn will lower sex drive.  After being off BC completely for about 5 months and seeing no improvement_ I went back and the doctor prescribed Wellbutrin.  This is an anti-depressant which has a track record for increasing sex drive in women.  I took the Wellbutrin for a month or so and finally started to want sex sporadically.  I figured it was working and since sex was back in the picture_ I needed contraception.  Started taking Micronor (the generic Jolivette to be precise) to ensure that I wouldn't get pregnant but I'm not entirely sure that it hasn't undone what the Wellbutrin helped me achieve - a libido.  I'm a little frustrated that my sex drive has decreased a bit more and the acne is more frequent.  Plus_ I've been taking it for over 30,F,24,30  days,11/13/2008Email,Micronor

I do not think this should be after child birth. It does past through the breast milk and there are no studies proving that it's safe for the baby. Why would this be prescribed? I would rather go without sex than continue with the side effects.,F,33,13  days,11/8/2008,Micronor

OVARIAN CYSTS!,It did help the polyps from growing back after a D&C_ however giving me ovarian cysts wasn't a plus! Took this pill from March of 08 through Sept 08 in the Jolivette form .35 mg. Could NOT lose weight at all. Was at the gym every day for 1.5 hrs and bike riding for 2-3 hrs on Sunday... eating 1200 calories a day... and would still GAIN. WTH! Nearly had laparoscopy for the cysts until I found that the drug can cause them_ right now we're monitoring the cysts to see if they stop now that I'm off.

This pill didn't do much better. While my cramps were less_ the addition of acne_ weight gain_ and constant brown discharge have inspired me to stop the pill completely. I'm 33 years old and if it happens_ it happens. I've been off micronor for 2 weeks now_ and my face has completely cleared up! I feel great and just finished my regular period. Oh yeah_ and no more brown discharge. I'm very happy on nothing!,F,33,9  months,9/25/2008,Micronor

540, 4, Prevent pregnancy,Very mild spotting and sore breasts,I've been on this for a few months after being on nothing for over 2 years.  My doctor said it would regulate me and I was nervous after reading several reviews that it doesn't regulate cycles very well.   So far and i've only been on it 3 months_ my cycles have been every 28 days (which is wonderful since before that they were like every 4 to 7 weeks that I'd get one) I haven't had any weight gain or anything.  I did have 2 days a very very very minimal spotting the first month adn that was 4 or 5 days into the pill.    I didn't even need a pad or anything for it though and my breasts are a little more tender 8 to 10 days through the pill each month.

547, 2, birth control,Terrible anxiety and depression.,The mood swings are intolerable.  I am NOT prone to mood swings_ but since taking this pill I have constant anxiety and depression_ especially the week before my period.  It is extreme and severe and really rather frightening.  I don't know if this is a temporary effect - I've been on the pill for two months - but the anxiety and depression are disrupting my life.  I almost quit my job and broke up with my boyfriend during this last round of PMS_ and even if it is a temporary/initial side effect_ it simply is too disturbing to endure.,F,40,2  months,5/25/2008,Micronor

It is day five and I have very heavy spotting and cramps_ as if I am on my period all over again even though it just ended a week ago_ and I feel very emotional and depressed and started crying uncontrollably and feeling suicidal.

Fog like existence.,I went off Micronor because I was sick and tired of bleeding every couple of weeks.  I went off it in Dec 2007_ called OB in March 2008 due to lack of period. I was put on drugs to start my periods.. had a small period but it is now  May 2008 and I haven't started my period.. I am not pregnant.  I'm just glad I got off of this 14 months before we plan to have kids... I wouldn't have been happy if this happened when I wanted to start!Beware.. this stuff messes up your system.

552, 2, birth control_ no estrogen,no weight gain_ no change in mood_no loss of sex drive_ but about two weeks into it i had light spotting for 2-3 days. Still yet to have had a period.,I was hoping for regularity_ but not such luck. I have blood clotting problems and so I can't take estrogen pills_ so this was the only option. I love that that it doesn't make me feel any different_ but constantly worrying that I'm pregnant sucks. It's not bad if you don't want a period_ but I would suggest using a second type of contraceptive (condoms?) so that you don't have to worry aobut getting your period.,F,18,2  months,4/21/2008,Micronor

554, 5, birth control,no side effects but tender breast. I think the more you read what everyone else is having you think you are experiencing the same. If you think you are depressed_ it will make you depressed. If you and your partner are happy there should no reason to be depressed unless its for another reason. Give it a chance _ i did research on POP and this is the most far best one out there as in the ingredients and levels used in the pill.,,F,36,1  weeks,4/17/2008,Micronor

I did well on that pill_ it was very balanced and I had hardly any side effects or complaints at all. I am a non-smoker. Ladies beware!!! Ortho Micronor is the pill from hell. I've had this terrible chronic upper backache as soon as I started this pill_ It interupts my productivity and daily life and I feel like an old lady. I'm having alot of irregular spotting and sporatic periods which interrupts my sex life (I'm in a stable relationship) I am experiencing bouts of depression and fatigue as well as acne. I have never gone through any of this with any other pill. I'm getting off this pill asap and getting a Mirena. I don't know what's in this pill but it needs to be taken off of the market.

I hate that I don't know when I'm going to have a period.  Only in the last 6-8 months have I noticed the horrible acne before my period.  Sometimes I'll have cramps and breast tenderness and then NO PERIOD. Weird,I don't know what my other options are_ I guess I'll just struggle through.,F,40,3  years,4/8/2008,Micronor
559, 3, needed a pill with less hormones.,breast very tender_ sometimes swollen and painful to touch. Havent had a period yet or any cramps. The first few days of taking the pill I was very irritable but after that was fine. Sometimes I do get a little emotional but that may not be from the pill. Also_ have had a tiny breakout on my face but nothing too bad.,So far I am pretty satisfied. I take the pill the exact same time every day and havent had very bad side effects. No headaches_ bad breakouts_ weight gain_ or spotting. Seems like a good option for people who require less hormones.,F,21,4  weeks,4/7/2008,Micronor

Baby #2_ after taking Micronor for six months_ I was having TERRIBLE cystic acne and it suddenly occurred to me that it was the hormones_ not a change in how well I wash my face_ etc. I've been off it for a few months now but my face refuses to heal. It's very frustrating. I can't believe I forgot that it made me break out the first time around.,F,28,10  months,4/6/2008,Micronor
562, 2, Migraines-couldn't take estrogen,little bit of weight gain_ severe mood swings/depression_ bad cramps even weeks before my period,I was wondering if I was just going crazy but after reading all these comments I see there's obviously a trend.  since i've been taking micronor i feel a lot more depressed and irritable.  this sucks,F,18,8  months,4/2/2008,Micronor
563, 3, had bad periods before_ low hormone,acne! for the first time in my life i've experienced a lot of chest acne and some back acne_ not to mention constant face breakouts! Isn't the pill supposed to help with acne?,while it did eliminate my hereditary disposition for bad pms and heavy periods (main reason i take it) with very little hormonal treatment_ I have been getting ridiculous acne. The first 6 months my sex drive was soooo low_ and anxiety/depression were high_ (felt unstable with crying and even social phobia)! but I have a history of depression in general_ and all of those symptoms stopped being a problem when i started on anti-depressants last year. Sex drive/ability to orgasm is thru the roof now. Pick you poison_ i guess....trade-offs in everything....still considering changing_ but to what? No weight gain here_ periods are regular now_ but very light...took about a year for that to happen.,F,29,2  years,3/30/2008,Micronor
564, 5, Breastfeeding,Although everyone has said they have gained weight - I have lost (although due to following weight watchers and exercising as I did before I had my children).  I get the odd headache (which I attribute to a lack of water vs the pill).,I still have yet to have a period (nothing) I even weaned my son 4 weeks ago and still nothing.  If I did have any of the side effects I have to admit that I never noticed them.  I am about to change to a full BCP that includes Estrogen so I was doing research and thought I would look up the one I was taking.  I was surprised by the other reviews.  But each body is different and reacts differently.  I take my pill at exactly the same time everyday - maybe that is important to avoid side effects?,F,36,8  months,3/27/2008,Micronor
565, 1, Birth Control,Felt like my head was in fog_ very miserable and just not myself.,I really felt like I was ill or going mad_ one night I couldn't remember how to start the car when I stalled it on a busy hill with 2 babies in the back and had to get my husband to come and rescue us.  Also felt really depressed to the point of nearly going to the doctors. The tiredness could only compare to being pregnant. Stopped taking it and felt 100% better in 48 hours.  not sure what I'm going to use now.,F,37,12  days,3/18/2008,Micronor
566, 4, Birth control,irregular bleeding_ some acne,I really like this bc because I barely have any side effects. The only thing that is kind of annoying is the irregular bleeding and I have always taken my pills on time but it is something I would rather deal with than the potential side effects from estrogen.,F,21,6  months,3/16/2008,Micronor
567, 3, endometriosis,Pro: decreased pain and cramping during period; no change is sex driveCons:  frequent break through bleeding (I take pill at same time each day).  Extreme breast tenderness/ swelling (to the point people have commented that my breasts are bigger).,,F,38,6  months,3/13/2008,Micronor
568, 4, Intolerance to estrogen BC,Slight weight gain_ frequent breakthrough bleeding_ increased back acne,I am limited by BC pill options because I experience severe depression on any pills with estrogen in them.  I am happy to say that I have experienced no mood problems except for occasional pms-type symptoms.  I haven't had any loss of sex drive and I am losing the weight I initially gained (5-8 lbs). My biggest complaint is that I have had alot of spotting and an irregular period but this seems to be finally lessening as the months go by.  I solve the exact time every day problem by setting my cell phone daily alarm.,F,33,6  months,3/11/2008,Micronor
569, 1, age,increased hot flushes_night sweats even though having those already but not as severe as now break through bleeding absolute pain in the rear_anxiety_awful mood swings_crying_headaches_feeling dizzy and tired aching joints and muscles_hair loss basically feeling really rotten,stay away from it is my opinion after reading the comments here tonight i will definatley stop taking it was near enough 100% sure it was the micronor making me feel like this as felt great before even though 3mths post c section when i started taking it.,F,38,2  months,3/9/2008,Micronor
570, 2, Breastfeeding,Dizziness_ nausea_ cramping_ bloating_ anxiety_ no sex drive_ back acne.,,F,29,2  months,3/8/2008,Micronor
571, 2, Birth Control,Cramps_ breakouts everywhere_ moody with boyfriend_ bloated,I do not like this pill at all_ i still havnt had a period but my dr sed its fine...i HATE not knowing if im pregnant or not_ i ambloated and moody. I am going to look for another pill_ although i cannot take combined ones as i had migraine with aura once (VERY annoying!) so i dont reali know wat to do_ are there any proestrogen ones only that have a break? dont think so...might get injection...but neway_ not a good experience with micronor_ constantly paranoid and waiting for a period!,F,20,3  months,3/5/2008,Micronor
572, 3, birth control,MICROGYNON 30,This is a fantastic site.  Why isn't Microgynon 30 on here?  I have taken Ortho-trycylen_ Ortho-cyclen_ and the Nuva Ring in the United States with no big side effects (I'm pretty durable).  I came to the UK and took Microgynon 30- Wow.  It took me awhile to realize it_ but it had a profoundly negative impact on my mood!  Of my friends here_ 2 have also experienced side effects because of it: continuous bleeding_ and migraines.  I believe Microgynon 30 has more hormones than anyone really needs to prevent pregnancy.  I am in my first month of trying Micronor_ fine so far.,F,22,1  years,3/4/2008,Micronor
573, 2, bc - migraine sufferer,complete loss of sex drive_ depression_ mood swings_ stomach pains_ acne_ excess sweating,i was put on this because i suffer migraines. i have LOST 3 stones on this pill. have suffered bad acne_ loss of sex drive - which when i consulted my doctor about_ was told it was because my son is 10mth old and my body still recovering from pregnancy and birth! Before taking this pill i had a very high sex drive_ even up to the birth of my child. which is why i cant understand why my desire has gone. after reading this review i will be stopping this pill and using alternative methods! will see if my desire comes back.,F,29,10  months,2/25/2008,Micronor
574, 1, bc,Just dont feel right_ very stressed and panicky.   Bloating_ acne_ stomach pain and no sex drive.,Have suffered from depression and anxiety before and having taken micronor for only a very short time I can already recognise the same feelings.,F,34,6  weeks,2/23/2008,Micronor
575, 4, Breastfeeding,Sometimes I get very painful sharp cramp maybe once a month if that.  I have a short temper and my anxiety is a bit worse. Weight loss_ don't feel like eating_ no period.  Sometimes I feel dizzy too.,I think this pill causes me to have slight depression and anxiety_ but I like that I don't have a period and I don't have cramps like I used to.  My skin is clear and I lost weight_ which could have been part of the fact I was nursing my baby.  But I am now 20 lbs less then before I got pregnant.  I just don't feel like eating very much.,F,28,12  months,2/19/2008,Micronor
576, 1, Birth Control while Breast feeding,Weight gain! Bloating_ hair loss_ frequent periods (every 2 weeks)_ and HORRIBLE ACNE! Lost very little baby weight despite running 25 miles per week and dieting. Tired all of the time despite 8 hours of sleep per day. Loss of sex drive.,Lost 2 pounds immediately the week after stopping.  Never had a problem with weight gain with estrogen combo pills. Recommend this as a last resort if you NEED contraception while breast feeding.  I stopped the pill and have been myself again.,F,30,4  days,2/16/2008,Micronor
577, 2, reduce heavy bleeding during period,REALLY sore breasts_ weight gain (7-10 lbs)_ severe cramping before and during period_ long but light period.,I would rather have a regular_ but heavy period than bleed continuously for 9 days. I couldn't figure out why my breasts were so sore - now I know. I feel bloated and can feel the weight gain now_ which is discouraging as I just started a running program. I will stop taking these pills asap.,F,40,40  days,2/11/2008,Micronor
578, 4, had a stroke being on the combined,so far the breast tenderness and the lengthly periods. went from 3 days to 1-2 weeks but with lighter flow. no weight gain and sex drive is fine.,,F,33,9  months,2/10/2008Email,Micronor
579, 2, BC,Constant Mood Swings that I can not snap out of_ No Period (this is going to be my 3rd month)_ acne.,If you dont get your period how are you suppose to know if youre pregnant or not every month?,F,23,3  months,1/31/2008,Micronor
580, 4, birth control while breastfeeding,the first pack i took_it was a week after i after my period_ and about 12 days into the pack i had a period for about 7 days. not sure if my period was due anyway_ or a combo of that plus breathrough bleeding. no nausea_ which is wonderful. i took combo packs before and i took them 3 months_ and was still nauseous like the most wicked morning sickness you could ever have_ so this pill is a wonderful change. the only downsides are migraines. i am in the second pack and have gotten one every day since day 11 of this pack. the second downside is_ i haven't gotten a second period. i have a very obsessive personality_ and b/c of this lack of a period_ i am taking pregnancy tests every 4 days or so. i have decided this is rediculous_ and i have resorted to checking my cervix to see when i am ovulating_ (2 days ago) and avoiding sex entirely on that day.,this pill is good for someone who can't take estrogen b/c of the nausea_ but bad for someone who is obsessing about being pregnant on the basis of no period. i am trying to relax and enjoy this_ but the not knowing when my period will arrive is killing me. i have noticed an increase in my sex drive_ and the first pack of pills i was extraordinarily moody_( like your first trimester) but it seems to have leveled off. the headaches are a little bothersome_ but hopefully by the third pack things will level off in that area.,F,24,51  days,1/30/2008Email,Micronor
581, 5, birth control,none,My pms seems to have lessened; still get the usual teary emotional thing within a few days of my cycle -which is the norm; regular and timely periods; this is my second month; I am a smoker who cant tolerate Estrogen. No depression noticed thus far. Perhaps an occaisional swollen hands/finger. Just hope it works for contraception with no side effects??!! Yikes?,F,38,60  days,1/29/2008Email,Micronor
582, 1, Can't take eostrogen,Severe depression_ sexual urges vanished_ tired_ increased appetite_ bloated_ painful breasts for a week leading up to period_ regular monthly period but very heavy.,I've only been on this pill for 10 weeks and am stopping it today!  Your comments have confirmed my suspicions after thinking about it last night which is why I found this site.  I've been deeply depressed for the past 3 weeks with the accompanying symptoms I've listed and to not be sexually responsive to my boyfriend during this time tells me there's definately something wrong with me.  I see there being no other reason than this pill.  I can't live like this anymore and look forward for this drug to be out of my system so I can go back to who I was.  I'd rather risk pregnancy than go through this again!,F,38,10  weeks,1/25/2008,Micronor
583, 1, contraception,took this pill for only 7 days. on day 2 i began to experience tightness of the chest_ headache_ dizziness_ pain in arm and leg. brown discharge that gradually got more over the week. decided to stop taking pill on day 8. have been off it now for 6 days and although arm and leg pain_ tightness in chest_ dizziness and headaches have stopped_ i am now experiencing severe depression_ mood swings and anxiety as well as bad stomach pains. is this normal?,wish i had never bothered,F,26,7  days,1/20/2008Email,Micronor
584, 3, cannot take estrogen due to migrain,My acne got worse. I also went on medication for depression. This medication did not help my migraines. My doctor told me to stop taking micronor because it can aggravate migraines and depression. She advised that I use the paraguard IUD that has no hormones in it.,I never had a period on Micronor_ which was wonderful most of the time. I did take pregnancy tests periodically to make sure I wasn't pregnant. However_ I'd rather feel better and have fewer migraines so I have stopped taking my medication.,F,25,12  months,1/10/2008,Micronor
585, 1, birth control,weight gain_ very bad headaches often just before i get my period. i never had monthly headaches before taking micronor. just don't feel right. if i miss more than 3 hours i often get breakthrough bleeding almost like a mini-period_ and my schedule is off for the next month.  the only advantage is that my periods are  very light and only last for 3 days_ whereas  naturally they are quite heavy and last 7-8 days. but for me the side effects are not worth it. i just stopped taking it and am waiting to see how i feel.,nurse at OB office  informed me she has seen many women  pregnant  with micronor even when taken exactly on time and that one should use a backup like condom_ spermicide etc for days 11-17 of  the cycle to be safe.,F,39,18  months,1/7/2008,Micronor
586, 4, as a birth control,Missed periods_ heavy discharge and a few cramps weeks before period began.,Appart from the worry of missing a period for a month_ I find this pill helped. Yes_ i sometimes get grumpy and feel bloated but you tend to experience this anyway be it on this pill or not! I have taken this pill for a year now and the only problem ive had is the missed periods but they always arrive in time!!!!,F,22,1  days,1/1/2008,Micronor
587, 3, BC,No side effects_ just a lil sad when I get close to the sugar pills. This is the 3d pack im starting and I still dont have my period...,No period and im on my 3d pack..,F,20,3  days,12/31/2007,Micronor
588, 1, breastfeeding,Extreme mood swings_ decreased sex drive_ decreased ability to reach orgasm_ bleeding between periods,I am normally a very rational person_ and I first noticed a problem with this medication when I was having mood swings that were worse than the ones I had when I was pregnant.  The final straw came this week when I failed to reach orgasm during sex on three occasions (normally this isn't a problem for me).  I'll be stopping use immediately and using condoms.  I never had a problem with the combo pills.,F,27,2  months,12/27/2007,Micronor
589, 1, High Blood Pressure,Was on Microgynon 30 and never a problem apart from rising blood pressure. After literally first day on Micronor experienced extreme bloating and cramping_ bleeding_ mood swings - felt awful.  Stomach like a balloon even though I had not put on any actual weight (probably cause I couldn't face eating). Stayed on it for 3 months to see if symptoms would settle with no luck. Have come of Micronor and am searching for a better solution from my GP. Prefer being on the pill as contraception 'just in case' but to be honest can't face the side effects of this pill. I found the whole experience bizarre given my body usually works like clockwork!,,F,26,3  months,12/13/2007,Micronor
590, 5, Birth control,Nausea with the first dose; as long as I take it with a meal_ no side effects.  Shorter_ lighter period so far and no breakthrough bleeding,I have a family history of extremely high blood pressure and was leery of any estrogen as mine is slightly above normal_ but not high enough for medication.,F,22,30  days,12/8/2007,Micronor
591, 4, High blood pressure,Most annoying is almost permanent dry mouth which started within days of starting Micronor - constantly chewing gum_ cleaning teeth and obsessing that I have bad breath. Definite PMS_ never suffered with it on combined pill or no pill_ but can definitely pinpoint tearfulness and grumpiness to dates now.,No periods for first 6 months (excellent)_ now pretty regular as without the pill but longer_ worst lasted 3 weeks but that was only once. Comments sound pretty negative but overall not too bad - at least I know it's not affecting my blood pressure.,F,38,18  months,12/4/2007,Micronor
592, 1, Birth Control,Severe anxiety_ mood swings_ iriitableness_ weight gain_ tiredness. Constant  heavy spotting for 4 months but only 1 real period. Killer for the sex-life!,I specifically asked my GP for a pill that dosent cause anxiety or depression as I am prone to both. She diagnosed MICRONOR but after 4 mnths I feel worse than ever - a nervouse wreck.,F,38,4  months,11/27/2007Email,Micronor
593, 4, had to go off combo pill,This pill worked great for it's purpose. It is the only pill for birth control if you can't be on a combination estrogen/progesterone pill. However you will experience side effects. I normally had excellent skin_ but while on this I experienced frequent blemishes_ and my back would even get bumps. That never happened before. Also I never knew when I would bleed_ and how many days.,I just stopped taking it yesterday so I'll see how it goes!,F,35,1.5  years,11/23/2007,Micronor

597, 2, Contraception,Excessive hair loss_ fatigue_ depression_ irregular periods_ minor weight gain,Was taken off TriCyclen b/c of my age & smoking altho I'd never had a problem with that brand. Has taken me two years to figure out I'm better off without this one; my husband got a vasectomy & I'm already feeling better - more energy_ no more hair loss! Would rather have a longer period than deal with the side effects.,F,41,2.5  years,11/9/2007,Micronor
598, 2, bc while breastfeeding,depression,shocked by the depth of depression and dealing with a 7 month-old at that!

Bloating and how lovely - acne and on my scalp as well!!!!,The cardiologist changed my BP medicine and my BP is under control but I do have to say that the migraines associated with my periods are basically non-existent.  But what a cost- acne_ weight gain and oh_ I forgot the tan/brown spots now showing up on my face....I understand this can happen at my age but all of a sudden when I start taking this medicine --- and none of my three sisters have age spots and they are 10_ 12 and 13 years older.  When I was a teen I didn't have acne on my scalp or even a pimple or two on my back - which I have now.  The second month I bled for 16 days....I wondered where it came from and then the third month I questioned my own thinking because I never bled or even spotted.

Month 2 and 3 were not great.  Although cramping did diminish_ the spotting continued and 8 day period was not at all good.  All in all_ with the weight gain_ and no real relief from my symptoms_ this pill is not for me.  I quit after 2.5 months and now_ two weeks after stopping my cramping seems to have subsided_ I no longer spot and have not had a period yet.  I'm sure my body will come back to normal in no time (and that's too bad!)  I don't worry about birth control - I had my tubes tied a while ago.,F,46,3  months,8/6/2007,Micronor

619, 4, Fibroids & heavy bleeding,No weight gain/loss.  Very minimal breast tenderness the first month.  No acne and way more energy from the estrogen domaniance. Much better than the combo bill I was on years ago for 8 yrs.  I would get back migranes before my period.  I am spending my time posting to help someone.  It seems that only negative results are always posted on these things.  The medicine helped me a lot.  I am still deciding what to do about my fibroids and heavy bleeding_ but this is a bridge for me now.,I asked my Dr. for it and he said that it wouldn't help.  But it has.  I do however still get a heavy period_ but it has never been as other women's horry stories.  My PAIN is what has really_ really improved.  I would have pain about 5 days before and some days after with pain.  Also_ during the middle of my cycle was unpleasant.  The only reason for a rating of 4 instead of 5 is because the bleeding didn't reduce.  Definitely worth the try.

621, 2, birch control,weight gain_ emotional_ irregular period_ and heavy bleeding.,When I first started the pill I rarely had a period_ but now for the past four months or so I have been having my period every other week practically_ very frustrating. My doctor said I would need to take this because of my migraines_ but my migraines haven't gone away.,F,21,1  days,5/30/2007,Micronor
622, 2, Birth Control,I have been on this pill for two weeks and have taken myself off it.  I was prescribed it b/c of high blood pressure.  I have been VERY emotional and finally contributed this to the Micronor (never had adverse reactions to any other BC pills before).  I was frustrated_ irritated_ slight bouts of depression_ easily angered_ on the verge of tears over silly things...my poor boyfriend!  I'll just do without_ thanks!,I know this pill contains no estrogen_ but I'm wondering if it also interacts with the estrogen producted in our bodies (suppressing it?)_ thus adversely reacting with our hormones?  I definitely did not feel normal...here it is the day after I stopped taking them and I feel better already...,F,27,17  days,5/24/2007,Micronor
623, 4, Nursing/Birth Control,"I haven't had a period since i started_ haven't gained any weight_ increased sex drive (weird thing_ since I'm not a very ""active"" person) and again no periods yet_ Love this pill so far.",I did get a migrane once and I don't know if it was because the pill.,F,24,2  months,5/16/2007Email,Micronor
624, 5, Didn't want Estrogen,Gained 18 pounds in 6 months.  Seriously reduced my eating intake and increased exercise.  Weight has now levelled off to 10lbs gained. Not had a period in almost 3 years...I am 33!!!  A little panicky during the first year with no periods_ but as the doctor assures me_ if you take this pill within 3 hours every single day_ you will not get pregnant.  No mood swings_ no cramping_ NO Periods_ I love it!!!  My 15 year old daughter is on a combo pill and she gets periods like clockwork.  She really hates that I don't get them at all anymore.,I would suggest Minocycline daily for the acne_ this can be prescribed by a doctor.  I love this BC!!!,F,33,4  years,5/10/2007Email,Micronor
625, 2, nursing,Bloating_ weight gain_ period once in 3 months_ heavy period,I started taking this pill while nursing.  Feel really bloated_ started GAINING weight even though eat healthy and exercise regularly...gained 10-15 lbs.  Paranoid about pregnancy since periods so irregular and when I did get a period_ it was very heavy.  Plan on getting off of it soon.,F,,4  months,5/5/2007,Micronor
626, 2, I need birth control I am  diabetic,lots of weight gain _ dr took me off depo to go on this micronor every month i have more weight gain,I have to take birth controll because diabeties is out of control and could hurt a baby_ and I am a brand new grandma.,F,43,2  years,5/4/2007Email,Micronor
627, 3, breastfeeding my son,Nothing when I took this after the birth of my son. With my daughter_ just felt blah for a bit.,I took it up until he was 10 months old (he was only nursing once a day just before bed)_ then I realized I was pregnant.  My ob/gyn told me after that that the micronor only works if you are fully breastfeeding.  Thanks for the info now.  i thoroughly read the instructions and no where does it say that.  I have half a mind to sue micronor if that is the case.  With my daughter_ I really do not like it anymore_ I am ready to stop taking it.  Not sure if it is actually worth taking if it doesn't work except when you are breastfeedingI took it about 10 months with each child though i went off of it when I was pregnant,F,22,20  months,4/20/2007Email,Micronor
628, 1, Migraines,I have had one period in 6 months. About 5 months into taking micronor my back and neck started to break out. By the 6 month my entire back was covered with little pimples. I experienced mild depression.,I stopped taking it the 6 month.,F,23,6  months,4/8/2007,Micronor
629, 5, Birth Control,When taking estrogen oral contraceptives_ I would get extremely bad migraines and headaches the few days before and the days during my period combined with extreme moodiness - these are the reasons I swtitched to micronor. Since being on Micronor_ I have experienced both weight gain and loss (ranging from 123-135_ but that primarily correlated to my amount of exercise/eating habits)_ I don't get migraines anymore and when I do get headaches they are much less severe and I don't see floaters anymore_ my mood is way better_ my sex drive has definitely increased_ and I rarely get my period. When I am active and eating healthy and not living with 2+ other females (I'm a college student so my living situation changes a lot) I do not get it at all (periods of up to 6-7 months without my period) and when I do start having periods again they are regular and not too bad.,I love this pill_ it has worked wonderfully for me. Make sure that you take it within an hour of the same time everyday (I set the alarm on my phone so I don't forget!) and it should work very well.,F,22,2.5  years,4/5/2007,Micronor
630, 2, contraception while breastfeeding,After 8 days I got my period_ which I found a little disconcerting as I was exclusively breastfeeding and this normally stops periods occurring. I also found myself getting very nauseous and sometimes running to the bathroom expecting to be sick.,My practice nurse and doctor never told me that the hormoes pass into the breastmilk and the effects on the baby are not known. Yet it says this on the leaflet that comes with the pill. I do not understand why this is therefore being descriobed as safe for breastfeeding. I stopped taking the pill after 8 days.,F,34,8  days,4/5/2007,Micronor
631, 5, Combined pill,periods lastest 4 days and were very light. i have also been able to skip periods easily without bleeding or pain. Currently no other side effects.,,F,15,1  years,4/3/2007,Micronor
632, 5, Estrogen Intolerant,mild bloating_ night sweats,If you are sensitive to estrogen_ this is the pill for you!  Regular birth control caused me anxiety_ mild depression_ and horrible cramping the entire month.  I have never felt better.  Besides some mild bloating and night sweats_ that gets better as I am on it longer_ I have no complaints!,F,23,3  months,4/1/2007,Micronor

635, 2, nursing,Depression_ anxiety_ general mood swings_ sporatic periods_ bloating.,I decided to stay on micronor after nursing to avoid taking an estrogen pill_ however that that is when I started noticing the symptoms.  Not getting a period regularly is very stressful_ and I have finally linked the mood swings to this pill as well.  I will be discontinuing this pill very soon!,F,29,2  years,3/28/2007,Micronor
636, 1, Needed BC but estrogen intolerant,Horrible skin rash_ bloating_ but the worst is the mental impact.  Extreme_ irrational outburst_ the worst depression I have ever experienced to the point I thought I needed to be hospitalized and I was afraid my DH was going to divorce me. Break through bleeding_ spotting_ bad cramps.,I finally made the connection between the trouble I have had with depression and extreme anger_ lethargy_ outbursts_ crying_ etc. this weekend and said enough.  I was unable to take traditional BC due to migraines but I think these side effects were worse than a weekly migraine.  I stopped taking it two days again_ made an appt w/Gyn and will start seeking options.,F,38,6  months,3/26/2007,Micronor
637, 1, contreception_ couldt have estrogen,extreme bloating and weight gainirregular and irratic bleedingperiod pain cramp even when not bleedingregular night sweats,now i have stopped taking it i realise how awfulit was_ i literally deflated within a week and have since lost lots of weight. irregular bleeding and therefore not knowing wether pregnant was a nightmare. all symptoms have gone now,F,34,2  days,3/20/2007,Micronor
638, 1, Nursing/Birth Control,EXTREME moodiness_ bloating_ weight gain_ bleeding everyday.,I do not recommend this medication_ try Lea's Shield!,F,24,2  weeks,3/18/2007,Micronor
639, 3, birth control while nursing,nausea_ cramps_ moodiness_ low sex drive.,I didn't like this as I always felt pregnant.  It was worse since my son was eating more_ and more solids_ and my doctor said the less I was nursing the less effective it would be.,F,24,3  months,3/7/2007Email,Micronor
640, 2, birth control_ pmt,bloating (my stomach feels very uncomfortable)_ weight gain_ leg cramps at night_ more fluid retention_ breakthrough bleeding,I had always taken the combined pill and stopped this some 2 years ago to give my body a rest.  My GP said that a woman of my age shouldn't take the combined pill and put me on Micronor.  My bloatedness and extra fluid retention makes me feel like I'm pregnant - not nice at all.,F,42,12  days,2/28/2007,Micronor
641, 4, nursing birth control,nothing too terrible_ just no period and lack of sex drive,I didn't really have any problem with this pill other than since I had no period and there is a 1/200 chance of getting pregnant with this pill_ I was always terrified that I might be pregnant (thankfully I never was).,F,20,1  years,2/7/2007,Micronor
642, 1, nursing,Definite weight gain despite exercersing and healthy diet. Wake up bloated every morning. Nausea similiar to morning sickness. Joint achiness daily similiar to flu like feeling. Initial bleeding for 3 weeks then no period again.,Very depressing to take this drug after having a baby and trying to loose weight and being unable to because of side effects. This should be throughly brought to your attention when doctors perscribe the medication.You have enough to worry about after having a baby then having uncontrolled weight gain_it is very bad for your self esteem.,F,22,4.5  months,1/5/2007,Micronor
643, 3, nursing/birth control,No period_bad acne on face and in my hair_bloating_ weight gain_ tired_ hair loss(hanfuls of my hair fall out),,F,25,3  months,11/16/2006,Micronor
644, 2, BC_ heavy period and cramps,At first I loved micronor. I didn't have my period for five months_ I finally did and it was very normal_ three months later I had my second period_ again normal; one month later I had another normal period. I thought my body was finally back on track and that I would have my period once a month as I should. BUT i was very wrong for the next six months I had my period almost every other week. It was always very light_ but it was almost constantly.,I couldn't handle having my period all the time. This just isn't worth it. Plus if you don't take it at the exact same time every single day you will most definatly spot.,F,21,1  years,11/13/2006,Micronor
645, 3, birth control while nursing,I had a ton of bleeding immediately after my lochia stopped when I first started taking it_ which tapered off. Then I didn't bleed at all for 6 months_ which may have been the breastfeeding or the pill. Then after I'd been taking Micronor for about 9 months_ I had a 3 week cycle_ followed by several 2 week cycles that then shortened to about a 10-day cycle. That's when I decided to give up the Micronor!,,F,28,11  months,10/30/2006,Micronor
646, 2, Alternative to Combined Pill,Fine for first 9 months then totally random periods_ eventually as many as three a month. Random occurance of *very* sore breasts. Massive increase in Thrush & BV. Vaginal swelling & Dryness. Chartable depression.,It seemed great at first_ but no point taking contraceptive if too sore to have sex! Off it for 7 weeks now. No period (aaargh!)but feel so much more energetic and well.,F,34,18  months,10/18/2006,Micronor
647, 1, Birth Control,Very heavy_ lengthy period.  Cramping daily.  Extreme breast tenderness.  Blurred vision.  Acne.  Mood swings.,I will not be taking micronor any longer.,F,38,1  months,10/16/2006Email,Micronor
648, 3, birth control,First 2 months. nausea_ dizziness_ 3rd month no period_ acne developed on my neck_ chin_ back. Still have some dizziness and nausea. Seems worst if I don't take med at exactly the right time.,In my opinion if you don't suffer from migraines just go with the regular estrogen pill. I'm only taking Micronor cause I suffered from migraines and vision disturbance_ stroke symptoms when I was on the regular pill. My doctor suggested Micronor. Never had a migraine since!,F,26,1  days,10/5/2006,Micronor
649, 4, Severe cramping;Migraines;BirthCont,No major side effects except that there is a distinct smell to vaginal/cervical mucus when I have sex that was never there before (OBGYN says this is normal with this pill). I LIKE not having my periods as long. I have much less cramping - even though there are more days with very mild cramps in the morning_ this is much more bearable than 7 days of disabled cramping as I had before Micronor. I bleed less_ so my anemia is gone. I typically get my period (very lightly) for 3 days mid-month_ and another 3 days at the end of the month. I no longer have any migraines which were caused by the estrogen in combo-pills I was on before Micronor. I also feel healthier and more confident because I do not worry about what the added estrogen (in other pills) is doing to my body/blood vessels/health.,The only thing I am wondering about is that in the past 6 months I have gained wieght - this might be due to other factors_ but it makes me wonder if the BC has anything to do with it. I would like to know which pills are the least prone to cause weight gain. Other than that_ I am very happy with Micronor. Because you have to take it at the same time each day_ I have my cell phone alarm set for 10 each evening and take it then. It seems to work best to take this pill in the evening rather than morning.,F,30,6  months,10/4/2006Email,Micronor
650, 1, Contraception,Wow_ well most outwardly notable was the irritability_ acne_ BLOATING (I deflated within days of coming off the stuff)_ my periods stopped... with that comes the anxiety of being pregnant_ my boobs actually shrunk_ horrible discharge_ thrush_ headaches_ general unexplained sadness. It's not worth it ladies.,Use a condom.,F,27,3  months,9/16/2006,Micronor
651, 5, nursing/birth control,cramping for the past two months -- because of the cramping I expect my period every morning but it never comes. Not terrible cramping but not comfortablealso_ increase body hair growth -- I'm waxing like crazy!,I always have heavy breakthrough bleeding on combined pills but not on this pill!,F,30,3  months,9/14/2006,Micronor
652, 3, Birth control,I've been taking Micronor for a couple of months now. I have definitely noticed that I feel nauseous sometimes - to the extent that I took a pregnancy test.  I also have had irregular and lengthy periods but that could be because I didnt take at exactly the same time... and that is something you really must do with this pill_ or the cramps etc can be quite uncomfortable.,,F,28,3  months,8/14/2006,Micronor
653, 1, Birth control while nursing,Major panic attacks and anxiety_ so bad I went to the emergency room convinced I was very seriously ill.,,F,34,2  weeks,8/8/2006Email,Micronor
654, 2, birth control,10-15 pound weight gain_ depression_ headaches_ decreased sex drive,the weight gain was severe and if i am ever late taking the pill_ i get really depressed and miserable...,F,36,7  months,8/3/2006,Micronor
655, 1, Progesterone Therapy For Seizures,"The moment I started taking Micronor (which was the day of my period)_ my seizure frequency increased dramatically.  Most people would think it would have the opposite effect_ being that ""progesterone has anti-convulsant effects"".  I stopped taking Micronor after 1 week.  After stopping_ my seizures have got less severe (re: went from complex partials when I lose it to simple partials where I am aware).  However_ five days after stopping micronor I still have frequent Simple partials (not as strong - they get better with each day I don't take it).  But I average over 50 simples per day since taking this drug.  The only plus is that once I stopped taking it the seizures are getting less severe.  My pharmacist thinks it will take 2 months minimum for my body to re-regulate it's hormones and for me to be back to the way I was (which was only a ""couple"" simple partials when I ovulate).  DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR SEIZURE THERAPY!!",,F,27,7  days,8/3/2006,Micronor
656, 5, heavy bleeding,Started Micronor because other BCPs made me sick.,I did not have any side efffects on Micronor.  I took Micronor to try to control heavy bleeding.  It did not help the bleeding at all_ new GYN said Micronor will not help patients with heavy bleeding/irregular periods.  It's great if you just need birth control because I had absolutely no side effects.,F,33,6  months,7/18/2006,Micronor
657, 4, Can't take estrogen,More energy_ increased sex drive_ body feels stronger. Some bowel irregularity_ but I'm not sure if it's because of micronor.,I normally have estrogen dominance which causes tiredness and fatigue. Since I've been taking micronor_ my energy has increased and I feel much stronger_ like my hormones are more balanced. And my sex drive has increased which is great. I haven't been on it long_ but so far my experience has been positive. I'm looking forward to possibly not having anymore periods as well because I used to bleed heavily. I had a period the first month_ but I think it's because I started taking micronor after I ovulated. So far I haven't had another one and I haven't experienced any spotting.,F,36,2  months,7/18/2006,Micronor
658, 5, progesterone only,2/3 pound weight gain (very minor) I have epilepsy and it was prescribed to increase the threshold. High progesterone-less seizures-worked very well-however_ got off one month ago to plan for pregnancy and still no period and not pregnant.,I definitely would reccommend it. Everybody has different reactions to medications. I have tried just about every birth control pill out there due to my seizure meds. This one has the least side effects and interacts with the least meds.,F,30,3  years,6/18/2006Email,Micronor
659, 4, painful ovulation/periods & endo,Generally_ I feel great! I have no abdominal bloating and weight gain as I have had with combo pills.  My only concern is my breast tenderness - this is rather bothersome and have grown a full cup size.,,F,37,3  weeks,6/1/2006Email,Micronor
660, 3, Birth Control,Wild periods_ irregular_ mood swings_ tender breasts_ discharge,Taking the pill at a certain time of the day is hard. My periods are supposed to have calmed down by now_ but I have to give it 6 months before possibly changing. This is the second time of being on it after an 18 month break_ so I know it does get better. I don't remember having a foul discharge last time though (I have checked to see if it was anything else!!),F,28,5  months,5/19/2006,Micronor
661, 4, birth control,I have been taking micronor for 4.5 months I have not experienced any thing other than my periods stopping (not a bad thing),,F,35,4.5  days,5/5/2006,Micronor

677, 3, contraceptive with no estrogen,I've gained weight_ I got my first period during the 3rd month.,I've switched from tri-cyclen to micronor due to an upcoming surgery. This is not a flexible pill_ you always have to be careful about taking it at the same time every day. I didn't get my period until the 3rd month_ and it causes me worries about pregnancy when I don't have my periods.,F,27,4  months,8/21/2005,Micronor
678, 4, BC-POP's due to migraine history,The only side effect I've noticed is the break-through bleeding that occurs the 1st six months of taking.  Now_ I rarely have a period--about every third month--and I'm not complaining about that!  It is a must that they be taken at the same time every single day though so you do have to be disciplined--or else there comes the break-through bleeding.,I hear that it is a little bit less effective than combo bc pills.,F,34,1.5  years,7/18/2005Email,Micronor

680, 3, birth control,slight nausea for a few minutes every few days.complete stop of my period after 5months.,take this if you have had visual migraines like me. if you don't have a good reason for taking this_ i would recommend a combination drug because this drug stops your period and it is freaky not knowing if you are pregnant or not....,F,21,7  months,3/26/2005,Micronor
