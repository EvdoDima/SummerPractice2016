0, 4, Prostate Cancer,Extreme shortness of breath_ night and day sweats_ loss of chest and leg hair.,My version is of leuprolide acetate is called Eligard. Does a good job of keeping my PSA to less than 0.1 but I also have the Alpha 1 deficiency which amounts to inherited emphysema. I was functioning normally despite the Alpha 1 before I received the first four month injection. Severe shortness of breath began immediately after the first injection. The condition of my lungs hasn't changed for two years and my pulmonary MD sees no reason for the change and attributes it to leuprolide acetate (Eligard).  Recently had the fourth injection and shortness of breath worse than ever. Is there an alternative drug? The side effect is turning me into a couch potato. I am really considering stopping the treatments. Walking accross the room results in shortness of breath. I thought this info would be helpful to anyone unfortunate enough to have prostate and lung illness.,M,67,1  years,10/5/2006Email,Leuprolide acetate
