0, 4, Endometriosis,no menstruation_ occasional to frequent spotting_ occasional random cramps_ possible slight weight gain in midsection (or am i just getting older?),I am also on Yaz_ where I take only the pills with the hormones (pink pills) and just throw away the placebos (white pills) and start the next month's pack.  I started this  at the same time as Danazol_ so it is difficult to decipher what effects are from which drug... but overall I am very happy with my current drug situation.  I was on Lupron for a year after my initial diagnosis and first surgery - it was HORRIBLE.  I gained almost 20 lbs and had crazy hot flashes all the time.  Went off Lupron_ was not on anything for 3 years_ and my periods were much shorter than they had been before_ and I'd usually only have cramps for 1 day_ managable through advil.  Then they found an 8 cm mass doing an mri for something else_ and I had surgery to remove the mass and my left ovary_ which had been consumed by endometrial tissue.  I am taking Danazol and Yaz now - *the spotting is better/less frequent if I take the drugs at almost exactly the same time every day and night.  I might have had a sl,F,30,6  days,9/26/2007,Danazol

3, 5, fybrocystic breast disease.,Excessive hair growth in unwanted parts_ shrinkage in breast size.,I have taken 100mg og Danazol almost everyday for 15 years (well over the recomended time) but I couldn't live without it.My breast pain was so severe I couldn't roll over in bed or even walk around without being in agony_ so the good things far out way the bad_ it changed my life !!,F,43,15  years,5/19/2007Email,Danazol
4, 5, Endometriosis,"Oily skin_ acne_ voice change_ increased ""bad cholesterol"" & decreased ""good cholesterol""_ muscle cramps.",It worked wonders for the endometriosis pain without causing any really bothersome side effects (except for debilitating muscle cramps during the first 4 months of use). No mood swings or sleep disturbances as with many other hormonal treatments. If my voice hadn't started to sound like a man's and my cholesterol levels hadn't become unhealthy I would most definetely have continued taking it. Bit of a bummer: pain returned almost immediately after discontinuing use. I was using a very low dose: 300 mg per day.,F,36,18  months,11/1/2005,Danazol
