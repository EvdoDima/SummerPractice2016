0, 4, Migraines.,No discernible side effects.,"Apparently_ it's an ""old"" medication. Doctors don't like to (are probably told not to by their pharmaceutical reps) prescribe it anymore. Most of the younger doctors don't know about it at all.  - - - It always seems to work for me_ although if I don't take it soon enough_ I might have to repeat the dose within the hour. Strangely enough_ less and less pharmacies are able to order this. This is unfortunate_ as the medical plans will not cover the newer migraine medications. - - - I wish pharmaceutical companies didn't aim for newer products all the time...it's not always better. Someone should tell them that this isn't the fashion industry!",M,50,8  years1 2X AN,1/28/2015Email,Ergotamine tartrate and caffeine
