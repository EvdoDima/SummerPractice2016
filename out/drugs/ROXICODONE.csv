0, 2, Spinal Headaches,Extreme sleepiness_ loss of appetite_ dry mouth_ shakiness_ euphoria and vivid crazy dreams. I just don't feel normal. I am taking this drug after being released from the hospital for complications of a spinal tap. While I was in there I was on a Dilaudid iv dose every 3 hours. I'm not use to taking any type of pain meds besides otc meds so I may just be very sensitive to these strong drugs. At any rate_ I do not like it. I will be talking to my neurologist to find out if the other drugs I am taking are just not mixing well with this particular drug. But from the other ratings_ I think I'm gonna try and stear clear until they find out what is wrong with me.,Helps my pain for 4-5 hours but if I stay awake I am not myself and just feel strange and jittery. Cannot function properly. Definitely would not drive or be able to do my job.,F,46,4  days20 mg,5/15/2016Email,Roxicodone
1, 5, Pain associated with arthritis,No side effects except less pain and I am able to carry out normal to heavy duty life style at home. But if you run out of this your going to have some Doozie withdrawal symptoms so I suggest not running out and taking as prescribed. If you have another pain issue I would take it up with my doctor before increasing amounts on your own so be sure to let your doctor know up front of any other pain issues so you want run out and get sick. It comes with age and there is no cure so doctors as well need to recognize that were not all addicts here. Some of us can take it and not have any problems while others cant. I further believe a family doctor could write this once an amount has been established and the patient does well but good luck finding a good doctor that will give it to you cause they just are not available.,I would definitely recommend this for pain. It works.,F,44,2  years15,2/27/2016,Roxicodone
2, 3, spinal stenosis_ disc buldge l4/l5,Drowsiness_ euphoria_ cravings for sweets_ General feeling of wellbeing_ constipation.,This medicine can be a great one when the doctor prescribing knows what their doing and the patient fully understands the med. this medicine works best for chronic pain when used with a long acting medicine_ pain relief usually only lasts 4 hours at the most_ dose needs increased pretty regular for it to continue to have the same effect_ there's ups and downs to this medicine its almost like a love hate relationship. Caution when used for several weeks to several months it's very possible to experience withdrawals when you do not need it anymore. Your doctor should ween you off. Good med but use with extreme caution. Follow the doctors orders and never take more then prescribed. Make sure you are 100% sure You need to take this med and try to take it short term_ it works best that way.,F,28,2  years10 mg,12/30/2014,Roxicodone
3, 4, Chronic Bladder illness/pain,Sleepiness_ occasional dizziness_ constipation,Works very well for the pain associated with interstitial cystitis an incurable bladder disease which causes inflammation and bleeding and cracking of the bladder wall. This med gave me back a quality of life after being bedridden for almost a year. Yes you will become dependent if taken regularly but under the supervision of a pain management doctor_ I am closely monitored every month. This was more effective for me than many other meds I tried including elavil_ tramadol_ cymbalta and norco.,F,37,1  years15mg,11/5/2014,Roxicodone
4, 4, Fibromyalgia,Very tired. But tired already. Itchy_ stomach problems_ and gerd.,,F,53,10  months15mg.,10/12/2014Email,Roxicodone
5, 2, Foot Fracture,None,I only used this drug for 3 days_ so take my review as you will.  I broke my foot falling off the last step of the stairs in my house.  I didn't even ask the ER doctor for pain meds_ but he gave me a prescription anyway.   The pain from my foot wasn't bad during the day_ only at night when I had to keep my foot elevated.   I took 12.5 mg of this and honestly it did nothing for me!    I feel like I could get a better effect from drinking a glass of wine!   I have heard this is very addicting so I am glad I didn't care for it.  Actually what happened is that someone stole half of my bottle_ I really don't understand it_ why steal from someone else's prescription?  I never thought anyone would steal drugs from me_ so my advice is to keep this under wraps if you take it_ you never know who might come up and steal it from you too!,F,33,3  days10mg 1X AN,4/2/2012,Roxicodone
6, 5, Severe pain from chronic illness,Mild constipation. Occasional false sense of well being. That being said_ this drug has improved my quality of life_ it really helps the pain. I'm very careful to NEVER take more than prescribed after reading some horror stories!,,F,26,3  weeks10mg,2/21/2012,Roxicodone
7, 2, lower back pain,euphoria_ constipation_ memory loss_ insomnia_ irritability_ addiction.,this medication is extremely addictive. the side effects outweigh the benefits. I would not take this again unless I was dying.,M,23,4  months30 MG 1X D,8/29/2011,Roxicodone
8, 4, Lyme disease widespread pain,Noticed even this small dose made me feel jittery. Thought it would pass as time went on. Instead by year 2_ severe heart palpitations started_ have read this is common w/long term use,Used as a breakthrough pain med. Worked well_ better than most narcotics especially since Lyme Disease pain is almost impossible to control. No constipation_ anyone having constipation on narcotic pain relievers simply need to add Magnesium Citrate at about 600 mg per day. It is estimated 95% of the population is mag deficient anyway and it is water soluble so goes right through you. Too much can cause diarrhea even on narcotic pain meds. It can be purchased at any vitamin store_ much safer than rx'd laxatives and helps mildly to relieve muscle twitching and pain too,F,47,2  years5 mg 2X D,2/4/2011,Roxicodone
9, 5, DDD_ Spinal Stenosis_ Hern. Disc,Sleepiness_ nausea_ loss of appetite_ occasional euphoria.,This medication has helped a great deal with my pain but the only complaint is that the relief is short-lived... at the most 4 hours. I have tapered off a few times because I don't want to fall victim to an addiction but as long as you are strong-willed and know the dangers of this drug it can improve your quality of living.,F,41,8  years30mg 6X D,8/31/2010,Roxicodone
10, 4, endometriosis,Very groggy_ dry mouth_ warm flushed feeling,It works for the pain for about 4 hours then BOOM it disappears and I need more. Only have to take during menstrual cycle. Hard to stop. Made me horribly constipated. Works well on the pain though!,F,35,3  months,11/10/2009,Roxicodone
11, 1, back pain,This drug is extremely addicting.  I was on 8  15 mg tablets a day_ along with long-acting morphine and a muscle relaxant.  Your body will continually crave more.   I was eating them like candy.  Trying to titrate down was basically impossible; I began to be afraid that I would die in my sleep.  I had no  life left.  I ended up going to a detox place in Florida to get off the narcotics.  I was there for 10 days_ and after I got home I was still in major withdrawal_ throwing up_ hallucinating_ everything including water tasted like cigarette ashes.  It has been a month and 10 days since getting off that medication_ and  I am finally getting my life back.  The amazing thing is_ my back feels better now_ without all that stuff.  It is completely worth whatever you have to go through to get off this med_ but the best idea is to never get on it in the first place.,DON'T TAKE THIS MEDICATION!,F,53,9  months,9/3/2009,Roxicodone
12, 4, Occiptal and Trigeminal neuralgia,Difficulty pooping_ general tiredness_ and vivid day dreams of my cat flying when 30mg or more is taken at once.,The neuralgias set in after they removed a three inch tumor from the base of my skull. I take a stool softener for the poop problem. Rest when I feel tired and laugh like hell when I think I see my cat flying. This med gave me back my life.,M,52,14  months,2/7/2009,Roxicodone
13, 3, rheumatoid arth_spondylitis_fibro,No side effects that I notice,It helps mild to moderate pain if you take 30mg.It does nothing fo severe pain.Enables me to cope with my severe pain 24/7.,M,36,1  years,12/20/2008,Roxicodone
14, 3, Pain from Hysterectomy surgery,If you  are going to go on oxicodone_ you need to have some strong self discipline to not run out before your next refill!  I have had a LONG and painful recovery from a total abdominal hysterectomy.  Horrible addition to this drug now.  I am in for a long ride when it is time to quit. I have a very hard time sticking to the doc's rules when it comes to tapering me off of the pills.  The drive for the drug is overwhelming. I have run out a few times a day before my next script gets filled and the withdrawel is HELL.  Can't get out of bed because you feel like crap. Dizzy and very lightheaded. I get totally and seriously depressed.  I feel physically ill. Doc wants to taper me off SLOWLY_ but I don't think that is going to work for me.  I am way too addicted (and I am STILL in pain from my surgery so they can't take away the meds or I will be suffering with pain that is way to hard to manage with over the counter meds.  Oxy causes constipation_ anxiety (because for me I,At first when I got  prescribed the Oxicodone I was excited_ because I thought this was supposed to be a really great drug for pain management.  WHAT A JOKE.  It only controls pain 2-4 hours.  Plus they say take 1 or 2 every 4-6.  First time you take it you have a great high.  After that_ just pain management_ that doesn't last long and is very hard to stay on top of.  Not only that but I get the fun of having my husband trying to steal pills from me here and there and then I end up short before the next refill and the withdrawel for me starts to get really bad in about 7-12 hours.  Then you feel sick to your stomach_ fatigued_ headache_ basically your whole body hurts because it is literally aching for the med.  And the depression is HORRIBLE.  All I do is cry and cry.  One because the pain is so bad and 2 because I want the drug  so bad that it hurts! I thought it was hard to stop smoking!  This is 100 times worse!  Now being on this website i have learned that Clonazapam (from the v,F,39,7  weeks,10/30/2008Email,Roxicodone
15, 4, Fibromyalgia,Constipation (can be mediated with Colace or Miralax); slight nausea on occasion (can be mediated with Vistaril),"The most unfortunate thing about Roxicodone is that it doesn't work for very long.  Four hours is about the maximum time between doses (although on rare occasions_ some people can get six hours of pain relief from it).  It's very inexpensive_ which is why I take it instead of the extended-release version (I don't have health insurance).  I've taken it off and on since 2002 and have never had an ""addiction"" issue_ and can stop it just by tapering off gradually.  My fibromyalgia tends to flare and then subdue_ so sometimes I need a narcotic pain med_ but sometimes I don't.  My current dose of Roxicodone is 15mg every 4 hours.The most inconvenient thing about this med (in my opinion) is that your body develops a tolerance to it quite easily_ meaning your dose needs to be increased to continue to be effective.  If you take a ""drug holiday""_ or switch to another narcotic for a couple of months_ it will solve the problem and you can go back on Roxicodone at a lower do",F,41,5  years,9/12/2007,Roxicodone

20, 5, pain,none,Oxycodone by itself is Instant Relief_ works up to 3-4 hours_ oxycontin is Extended Relief of same drug_ lasting up to 18-24 hours_ depending on patient. You have to weigh out whether you can live with the pain or not and just be honest with your doctor if you feel you are not taking your medication as directed or for other reasons -- because it would be a shame to have the BEST pain medications unavailable because of abuse etc. They are really given a bad wrap when narcotics are excellent medications when used correctly. Nothing else compares!,F,39,30  days,10/6/2005,Roxicodone
21, 5, Back pain from accident,minor euphoria_ constipation,This drug saved my life after my car accident. I was on it off and on for about six months_ and have now switched to less addictive medicine...I do NOT want to become an addict. But it is very effective_ just be careful with it.     ***To all of the people out there who intentionally abuse these kinds of meds: PLEASE_ do whatever you can to stop. Addiction is awful_ I have seen it first hand in a few friends. There are people who suffer from debilitating_ chronic pain_ who must have opiates to function and enjoy a decent life. Rampant abuse may end up causing the government to deny this medicine and others like oxycontin to patients who truly need it. Please_ for yourself and for others in real pain_ please quit!!!,F,21,6  months,5/7/2005,Roxicodone
