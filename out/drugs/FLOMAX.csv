I don't know that it was the Flomax but the fact that the toothache went away within 24 hours of stopping seems to be enough proof for me. I will speak with my urologist to see if there is an alternative medication.Also sexual side effects - no ejaculate with a weak erection.

Not uncommon for my age and was told I had many years before we needed to worry about it.  Fast forward 5 1/2 months and I was referred to an eye surgeon.  He was the one wbo told me about cataract formation being a huge side effect of Flomax  but it is regularly down played by some physicians.

As to the side effect of dry or reduced ejaculation amounts_ I now ejaculate a normal amount_ although it flows more than spurts. Another change is that after taking the flomax (about 4-10 hours)_ my erections tend to be very strong - almost like with Viagra. And my nocturnal erections are much more active. Usually getting up and urinating makes the erection subside_ but if not_ masturbation takes care of it.  All in all_ I would say that if you take an ACE inhibitor like lisinopril and need Flomax for BPH_ try alternating them.

136, 5, Prescribe for BPH,Went to site to hear about patients' side effects,"Sometimes ""congestive heart failure"" or ""CHF"" can cause nocturia or increased ""peeing"" at night_ by increased fluid shifting into the internal organs - lungs and kidneys. Think of your body like a sponge. When the sponge is flat in a pan of water the water absorbs throughout the sponge. When a sponge is hung up with a clothes pin the water drips out of the sponge by the force of gravity.If you have any degree of CHF (congestive heart failure)_ excess fluid pools in the most dependent (lowest)part of your body because the pump (heart)is less efficient.  If your legs are down during the day you can get fluid accumulation there - even some swelling or ""edema."" When you lie flat at night the fluid moves out of the dependent (low) areas and into your kidneys and lungs causing you to ""pee"" more and some people get short of breath if flat due to fluid moving into the very sponge like lungs.

I stopped taking it two days ago and the pain is now in my lower back_ I have used a full body heating pad at night to get some relief_ hopefully this drug will be out of my system in 3.5 days like I read on another site.  I was leary about taking this drug because it is not meant for women_ I was given it at the emergency room and was supposed to take it for seven days. I took it for only two more days and the side effects were almost as bad as the kidney stone.

He was recently hospitalized and had trouble voiding at the time. Then it appeared that his usual pattern for voiding reversed:  he would not go all day and get up every night.  Any insight into why this may have happened or what could be done to reverse this change?  Changing his pill time has not helped.  Thank you so much.,M,85,  1X D,11/8/2011Email,Flomax

Moved from Uroxatral because of minimal emptying of bladder which my full dosage of Flomax did help with. However_ the worst side-effect for me was the almost immediate truck tire sized body fat that surrounded my mid-section. Within a very short period of time I had gained well over 30 pounds. I tried (and stopped) Flomax back in 2007 because I perceived the same results. Figured I'd try it again because the general practice physician that prescribed it to me back then swore that no way was the drug causing my weight gain.

146, 1, Kidney Stone,Complete sexual loss,I was quite amazed at how quickly and how totally this stuff completely killed ALL sex. Over ten 10 days and 6 attempts at sex I was completely unable to obtain an erection 3 times. Three times I was able to however 2 of those times orgasm was impossible and the one time I was able to it was a complete disappointment and an absolute lack of ejaculate. The orgasm quality was less satisfying than a trip to the toilet. Looking at the stats for dysfunction it is at 18.1%. Now considering that this happens only to men and men are 50% of the test population it means that 36.2% of all men will suffer these effects_ that's almost 4 out of 10 men. Bottom line if it is not absolutely NECESSARY don't take it unless you really have the desire to become an eunuch.

186, 3, reduced flow and pain,some mental sluggishness,First the good news: I've just stopped taking it after five years and I'm doing fine. In fact -- this is weird -- I'm actually doing better than when I was taking it (a strange lower side back pain I often felt when urinating finally disappeared)! I attribute my improvement to the Avodart I've been taking also_ which_ I surmise_ reduced the size of my prostate sufficiently to make taking the Flomax unnecessary to control the symptoms. In other words_ an enlarged prostate must have been the cause and the symptoms (frequency_ urgency_ reduced flow_ back pain) were the effect. Flomax was dealing with the effect_ but since the cause had been removed or reduced_ the effect was also. But the Flomax served its purpose_ even though it never removed my symptoms entirely (and also made my mind a bit sluggish_ which I am so happy is now over). I was taking two Flomax capsules a day. Since my symptoms were so much improved after 5 years_ I decided to go down to one capsule; since that was OK for two months_ I stopped taking altogether. I immediately experienced bad effects. But after one week everything improved dramatically_ so I guess those were just withdrawal symptoms. It was 5 years_ after all. Anyway_ there is hope ... though patience is required. I guess Avodart was the real agent of long-term change for the better.,M,59,5  years,8/11/2009,Flomax

190, 2, BPH,Bad chest tightness & nasal stuffiness. Retrograde ejaculation and/or low semen_ depending on dosage. Very powerful drug. Reduced dosage to 1/4 of .4 mg. capsule by cutting capsule in half & taking every other day. On that dosage provides relief needed while almost eliminating chest tightness & nasal stuffiness_ & less retrograde ejaculation.,Should make available capsules in low dosage. Very messy to cut capsules_ but cannot tolerate .4 mg at a time. Tablets would be easier to cut. Canada only furnishes in sustained relief tablets_ so that is out. Terazosin gave worse side effects. Might try other alpha blockers like Uroxocal or new Rapaflow_ but suspect it is the nature of alpha blockers that causes these side effects for some. Finesteride may eventually shrink prostate making alpha blockers unnecessary for me.,M,63,4  months,8/1/2009,Flomax

Lastly_ sexual problems simliar to other posters,Before Flomax_ BPH meant an average 2 trips to the bathroom during the night.  Initially upon starting Flomax_ I noticed improvement in stream strength and reduction to 1 bathroom trip per night. [Caution - first day left me very dizzy - low blood pressure]  Concurrently_ the urologist perscribed Prostate SR (saw palmetto).  Previously_I took another brand occasionally.  Now (60 days) I take this one rigorously in the morning.  Given the side effects (blood pressure and muscle weakness) I stopped the Flomax after 60 days.  I believe that the consistent taking of the saw palmetto has helped me (not a general endorsement).  I am going to suggest monitoring with my urologist.  (Note: 45 days ago he did a test which showed that I was not retaining urine - i.e._ potential for kidney disease).  If the symptons get worse_ I will look into another treatment.

Flomax had little effect on my stream_ beyond the improvement that Avodart already provides (with no Avodart  side effects I can notice).,A year ago_ I was prescribed Avodart and Flomax for a 90g prostate_ reduced volume and dribbling.  I took the Avodart for a year with good results.  I held off on the Flomax_ though due to what I read about its effect on the eyes and safety when operating machinery.  A month ago_ after talkinfg to my eye specialist_ I decided to take Flomax too.  I did not notice the symptoms immediately_ and did not immediately associate the symptoms listed above with the drug_ since I had a change of shedule and change of location -- and got a cold -- about the same time I started the drug.  It took me a while to make the connection_ since I blamed other things.  As for the effect on my sex life_ I actually think it may have improved erections_ but anyhow I decided to discontinue_ and immediately feel rested.,M,62,1  months,12/14/2007,Flomax

But then it kicks in during the night and all day long_ reducing my frequent_ prolonged and painful urination problems.   I've been taking it for 5 years and it still does the trick.

I've seen some guys here talking about extreme dizziness from Flomax while adding they also take Viagra to combat the sexual side effects of Flomax_ or they were already taking Viagra/Levitra when they started taking Flomax. These two erection helpers magnify the blood-pressure-lowering effects of Flomax (it's an alpha-blocker_ after all) - they are both contraindicated for use with Flomax (though individual results may vary). Too-low blood pressure - hypotension - can make you real dizzy and a whole bunch of other things including_ if you're too susceptible_ dead_ but mostly just real miserable. If you're taking Viagra or Levitra with Flomax_ and you're having dizziness/weakness/etc. problems you're blaming on Flomax_ try switching to Cialis; the effects should be much less or entirely absent - and they're very individualized anyway (I have no problem myself taking any of these with Flomax) and even very healthy peo,M,60,2  months,4/28/2007,Flomax
260, 1, frequent urination / prostatitis,Sexual - ejaculatory dysfunction,Semen completely dried up after taking this for a week due to protatitis.  I beat myself off this morning_ failed to cum_ then freaked out and went straight to the internt for answers.  Thank goodness for this website.  I thought there was something wrong with me... I didn't realize dry orgasm was a side effect of the medicine.  I'd rather have to urinate all the time rather than have no load upon orgasm.  I wonder what happens to the semen?  Does it simply not get produced or does it enter into the bladder?  Wow_ I feel better after reading this article.,M,43,7  days,4/28/2007,Flomax
261, 3, BPH - extreme frequency,Only sexual. Either takes a long time (hard on my wife) or causes complete inability to achieve orgasm_ greatly reduced semen_ greatly reduced orgasmic sensation (so what's the point?) - all of which make me very uncertain about performance and get in the way of my desire_ so decreased libido and erections could be psychological or physical.,This works great for its intended purpose - makes long bouts of exercise and travel possible_ prevents the pain in my penis from peeing too often (urine passing through the urethra too frequently causes irritation and pain that also occurred in ejaculation)_ so it's a great relief. But the sexual side effects make it almost not worthwhile; very depressing. So here's what I do: take it only when necessary_ and that's been about every 3-4 days. It takes a while to wear off_ so a day after I take it the sex begins to improve; I don't take it again until peeing becomes too frequent and non-emptying_ or when I know I'm going on a long trip or long walk or doing heavy labor and can't stop to pee every hour. So I'm back to having sex about 8-10 times a week (I'm a stud! ;-) Being incredibly fit helps_ and that takes a lot of effort_ so I'm lucky that way). Don't assume that your decreased libido is physical. It could be a psychological reaction to the difficulty in coming and the poor results,M,60,2  months,4/26/2007,Flomax

But I'm also convinced the reason is interaction with other drugs--Levitra (for ED) and lithium (for psychiatric reasons). My Dr. says Lev. is working very well for me because causes Lev. to not break down as quickly because of effects on the kidney or liver (?). So for me it works for hours (up to 12)_ but she said for many men Lev. only works for about an hour But_ Lev. often leaves me feeling like I have a hangover--sometimes very unpleasant. Headache_ head pressure_ stuffy nose. When I started taking Flo. for mild urinary reasons_ I was very surprised to see noticable penis enlargement (unaroused) and that it was often easier to become hard. And very strong ejaculations.

I do seem to wake up more often at night (not to pee_ just wake up)_  however_ a difficult thing for me to evaluate since I've always been a light sleeper.

Wife was not happy with the situation either. Switched to alternative drug_ Uroxatral_ which has no sexual side effects for me_ and produces less wooziness on standing up. Pee-stream not quite as strong with Uroxatral as with Flomax_ but is nevertheless satisfactory.,M,54,7  days,7/8/2006,Flomax

Tiredness and sleepy.RAGE! Less patience with wife. I'm angry at my doctor for being pill happy and not listening to my concerns.Swelling and tenderness in testicles and pelvic area.,I was prescribed Avodart as well which gave me a double whammy on side effects. This medication made me feel like an old man with the same temperament. It made me almost impotent. The lack of sensation making love seemed not worth the effort. I have to make my clients happy and have confidence in me_ and the tiredness and apathy made it impossible. I quit taking it after 6 days and I am researching the use of saw palmeto_ nettle root_ cherry juice and other herbal remedies that are widley practiced in Europe. This is something my doctor should have known. It may be perfect for a 70 year old man but it didn't make me pee any better.,M,49,6  days,7/2/2006Email,Flomax

When I stopped_ I noticed the symptoms and instead of going back on Saw Palmetto I saw my doctor who prescribed Flomax. I would rather pee a lot than have to deal with the side effects from this drug.

Occasional retrograde ejaculation; some loss of libido; when I do ejaculate_ it's a water-like ejaculate that somehow doesn't 'feel' right when ejaculating.  On the plus side_ it did improve the flow rate and diminish the burning_ and cut the dribbles way back.,It's not a miracle cure_ and the sexual side effects can be a nuisance.  Lately_ I'm combining Flomax with saw palmetto and stinging nettle root_ and the combo does work better.

373, 4, Very Large Prostate,Initially it was a miracle drug. After a Cystoscopy my doctor gave me a prescription and the next day was my first night in years of sleeping through the night. I had mentioned my problems with painful urination and often passing sand but it was only after being asked by my family doctor that he took the next step. The side effects came after a few weeks. Less ejaculate_ sometimes none_ painful urination and reduced urine flow. I began taking two/day (2x.4mg) and urine flow improved_ pain lessened but still do not have the initial response from the first few days of use.,This may not be related but I do strength traing several times/week and have noticed minor chest pains which I never had before during or shortly after workouts with weights.,M,56,120  days,4/22/2006Email,Flomax

Amazing! But after several months the freq. increased again.  Started taking in morning so as not to be bothered at work and activities.  Drink 4 or 5 cups of coffee a day_which might be a factor.  Now day freq. is tolerable but getting up 2-5 times during night depending on evening caffeine intake.  Overall_ it has helped and my condition is stable_ but I am resisting higher doses for cost and possible side effects.,M,61,18  months,4/19/2006,Flomax

377, 1, BHP type symptoms,The most important serious thing we need to know about Flomax is a direct effect: This drug causes permanent changes to the eyes.      Flomax will preclude the possibility of relatively successful relatively safe cataract surgery in many if not most if not all cases.   Side effects: insomnia_ backache_ constipation_ headache_ visual changes such as photophobia and blurriness and diminished response to changing light levels_ tiredness/fatigue/weakness_ heart palpitations or arrhythmias_ stomach ache_ chest tightness_ nasal congestion. Pls see http://www.crstoday.com/PDF%20Articles/0405/crst0405_f5_chang.html,I'm wondering what others who have stopped using Flomax have experienced_ whether the side effects took a long time to lessen_  whether the side effects seemed to hang on after ending use.  I'm thinking of sending email to those who have left addresses here_ for the purpose of asking this same question.,M,64,1  days,4/11/2006Email,Flomax
378, 2, bph,Given samples by my urologist for standard bph symptoms and his concern that inability to completely void would worsen and ultimately lead to total blockage of flow.  Took in evening before retiring_ noticed immediate improvement in symptoms - better stream_ less frequency_ less discomfort.  BUT had a headache the entire  first day.  On second day experienced severe drop in ejaculate volume and dull orgasm.  I haven't taken flomax now for two days and urine flow still decent.  My doc said I could use the stuff during activities which could be expected to aggravate the prostate (extended bicycling or motorcycling as examples). I'm going to go to every other day to see if the ejaculation problems subside_ and if not I'll reserve if for an upcoming one-week motorcycle jaunt (with no expected sex) and see how that works.,Wish the doc had told me what to expect_ he merely said it wouldn't interact with any other meds_ but the comments here and elsewhere indicate that the ejaculation problem is darned near universal.,M,60,2  days,4/2/2006,Flomax
379, 5, Bladder not emptying_dribbles,Main side effects: headaches_ diziness in the morning_ fatigue_ stomach discomfort,I was making several trips to the bathroom night time_ feeling that my bladder does not empty the urine fully.I was also dribbling in my pants. My PSA is 0.38 ng/ml and my Urologist did endoscopy and said my prostate looks normal but because I use the bathroom 4-6 times at night_ Flomax might reduce this issue. The only side effect he mentioned was slight dizzyness and NOTHING ELSE.Flomax surely has helped a great deal with my urinary problem but after reading everyones comments_ I am not sure if I like to exchange one problem for another. I wonder if there is/are any natural medicine for prostate related problems. Finally_ I decided to take the medication every other day to see if I can control the side effects better. I will write back if I get good results. I will try Flomax for a week and then decide whether I will continue with this medicine.Besides_ the bottle shall list the side effects.,M,43,2  days,3/29/2006,Flomax

If I didn't empty my bladder every 20 minutes_ it felt as if I would urinate in my pants and my bladder became very painful. (2) No ejaculate upon orgasm_ which was somewhat distressing.,The side effects of this drug were worse than the symptoms it was supposed to treat. I would not recommend this drug if you can tolerate the symptoms otherwise_ which in my case were moderate difficulty in urinating.,M,46,10  days,3/8/2006,Flomax

Have yet to see decrease in ejaculate as many have described.,M,59,10  days,3/6/2006,Flomax
385, 3, BPH,indigestion and gas very uncomfortable. drowsiness. no ejaculate. back pain. abdominal discomfort. diarrhea. partial erections. stuffy/runny nose,I can not evaluate whether my bladder is voiding completely or not short of a sonagram. Unfortunately I think the side effects outweigh the positives for taking this drug. I also begin taking Avodart at the same time as Flomax and the combination may enhance side effects. I teach cycling at my gym and have not had it affect my energy level while teaching. If these side effects do not subside_ I may be forced to discontinue the Flomax.,M,73,30  days,3/1/2006Email,Flomax
386, 1, urine retention,retrograde ejaculation (At orgasm_ the ejaculate goes up into the bladder_ so nothing comes out at all.),If you are sexually active_ this drug can RUIN your sex life.  However_ since not everyone seems to get this side effect_ I guess it's worth trying.  If you do_ I suggest investigating how it effects your orgasm right away.  Retrograde ejaculation is very unfulfilling.  I plan to look into other alpha blockers with my doctor as alternatives.,M,34,1  weeks,2/28/2006,Flomax

390, 2, enlarged prostate slow urinary flow,half intensity orgasm 15 hours after first dose with no ejaculate.  No orgasm for 3 weeks after firs dose. Very frustrating for my wife and I.,I believe that because there was no ejaculation that the prostate was not depleted so began to build up pressure on the urinary tract and most symptoms began to return.  Overall not to much improvement and a lot of frustration.,M,64,22  days,2/4/2006,Flomax

393, 4, Brachytherapy (prostate cancer),Following the brachytherapy_ urine flow was reduced to dribbling. I couldn't fully empty my bladder even though the urge was almost painful. With Flomax the flow is better_ but still not back to pre-therapy rate. About half the time I don't feel I've fully emptied my bladder. Almost no ejaculate_ but I attribued it to the brachytherapy until reading comments by other users.,Both the urologist and oncologist said I should be off Flomax sometime between six months and a year following the brachytherapy. I'm told it takes that long for the radiation and trauma damage to heal enough to reduce swelling. I'm willing to stay on it for another 3-6 months_ but then I'm tapering off. Taking Cialis helps with the erection_ which makes it easier to orgasm_ but still little ejaculate. My wife's not complaining about this. For me orgasm is different_ although still satisfying. All in all_ Flomax works for me_ but I plan on getting off it soon.,M,62,3  months,1/29/2006,Flomax
394, 3, cancer - radiation treatments,Overall fatigue_ tiredness_ loss of libido_ erectile dysfunction_ no semen_,Took .8 per day for three months after IMRT and seed implants.

399, 1, Bladder pain_ urgency_ painful flow,None,I'm convinced Flowmax is nothing but a sugar pill.  I suffer from chronic severe bladder pain.  Also suffer from chronic urgency but pass large volumes of urine (12-16 oz. per event).  Never dribble. Never trouble starting.  Good flow.  Urologist was convinced I have prostate congestion since I practice complete abstinence and have for 13+ years_ no evidence of BPH_ PSA is 1.4_ prostatitus ruled out and tested negative for STDs.  He prescribed Flomax thinking it a panacea for any urinary issues.  The stuff did NOTHING.  Been living with this pain for 3 years now.,M,37,3  weeks,1/9/2006,Flomax

I have definitely felt like I was able to enjoy sex on it.  Reason: it helps with my bladder frequency and inability to empty it completely_ which interefered with my desire to have sex before.  I'm also starting a birth control pill that is triphasic that helps suppress ovulation and regulates my periods.  I think that I may be experiencing endometriosis symptoms and the FLOMAX helps with the pelvic pain in the sense that it really does make my urinary tract work better.Will stick to Flomax and bcp regimen.  I prob'ly have endometriosis or ovarian cysts.  The two meds work fantastic at controlling and relieving pain in my pelvic region.,F,28,3  months,12/26/2005Email,Flomax
403, 3, enlarged prostate,When I used to take a tablet a day_ I had huge difficulty in maintaining an erection_ even during intercourse. This difficulty disappeared 48 hours after I stopped taking the pills.,Flomax is very good at increasing urine flow but very bad in terms of interfering with your sex life. Taking these tablets is therefore a balancing act: taking one every three or four days is a reasonable compromise.Eating pumpkin seeds is a good additonal way of decreasing prostate size and improving urine flow.,M,60,4  years,12/23/2005,Flomax

Oh_ plus I was dizzy all the time. TERRIBLE drug.Switched to a different alpha blocker and had a much better time with it.

Some how Cherry juice_ prevents uric acid buildup in the urinary track_ and they now are finding out That the Perillyl alcohol_ which is in the skin of the Cherry_ destroys the proteins that the cancer lives on.  I find that the Cherry juice with the Flowmax work well together... I also take Vitamin B-12 & folic Acid. B-12 for the nerves_ and mind_as when you get older_ the myelin sheaths_(coating around nerves) dry out and deteriate_ one of the causes of multiple sclerosis & Alzheimer's disease & ALS. B-12 lubricates the Myelin Sheaths_ also carrys more oxygen to the blood.  I take 1000mcg Time Release B-12 as the time release will metablize in the intestinal track and not the stomach_ as the hydrocloric acid in the stomach will destroy the B-12_ because B-12 is 5% Cobalt_ and acids attack heavey metals.
