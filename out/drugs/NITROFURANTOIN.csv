2, 1, UTI,THIS SH** ALMOST KILLED ME!! Within 20 minutes of taking this pill for chronic UTI_ I began an anaphylactic reaction that lasted several hours and quite nearly claimed my life!  First it started with some itchy skin and before I knew what was happening_ I had hives popping out all over my arms_ neck_ chest_ legs and face.  Then my lips and eyelids started swelling shut_ along with my FREAKING THROAT!!!!!  COULD NOT BREATHE!  ALMOST DIED!!!!I don't know if any of you have ever experienced anaphylaxis_ but it's about the scariest thing ever. The real horror in this situation was that I experienced this reaction in the middle of central Alaska_ where the nearest hospital was three hours away!  Three hours is a long time to wait for an ambulance to come and get you_ so I had to rely on on an over the counter pack of Benadryl to save my life while my terrified friend rushed me to the hospital. The Benadryl saved my life. TAKING THIS DRUG IS A TOTAL CRAPSHOOT AND YOU COULD COME CLOSE TO LOSING YOUR LIFE IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE UNLUCKY FEW WHO REACT TO THIS DRUG.  BE WARNED!!!!!  THIS NEARLY KILLED ME!!,NITROFURANTOIN = ANAPHALAXIS,F,37,1  days?,9/22/2015Email,Nitrofurantoin

5, 1, UTI,PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS EVER. Find another drug. I took one tablet and have been left with permanent neuropathy. I am slightly numb all over with decreased smell and taste for 1.5 yrs. additionally l had dizzy spells for 6 months and was so exhausted l had to take 3 months unpaid off work then return part time. I was unknowingly anaemic and prescribed iron a few weeks later. Due to my health at that time l had a bad reaction and it messed my lungs up. I could not walk across the room without breathlessness. 1.5 yrs later l still have a stuffy weak lung_ neuropathy and am taking 20 vitamins a day just to feel normal. Extremely detrimental and l am still suffering.,,F,34,1  days,1/17/2015,Nitrofurantoin

8, 1, UTI,Throbbing of head_ night sweats_ chest pressure_ shortness of breath_ great weakness.,"According to Dr. Sidney Wolfe_ no one over age 60 should ever take nitrofurantoin which he calls ""a dangerous drug"".  Also_ the World Health Organization has said that older adults should never use nitrofurantoin since people over age 60 have a high risk of harmful side effects from it.

11, 1, UTI,I was taking this as a prophylactic treatment. At first_ no side effects.  Then_ night sweats_ anxiety.  Then_ joint pain.  Then_ vomiting.  I stopped taking it at that point_ but took it again when I experienced UTI symptoms.  This time_ I had full-blown anaphylaxis.,Drug worked great for a while so I was reluctant to stop taking it; this was stupid because I wound up in the ER quite suddenly when I took it again.  Strangely_ the allergic symptoms (hives and vomiting) never really subsided_ and doctors are keeping me on steroids (6 months later).,F,44, as needed 2X D,1/18/2011,Nitrofurantoin

14, 2, IC/UTI,Nitrofurantion was prescribed on  a long term basis for a 13 month period for a recurring UTI. The dose prescribed was 100 mg twice daily. A generic by EON was taken.  After a few weeks_ I started getting easily tired with ordinary things like shopping_ etc. But I did not attribute it to the medicine. After 11 months_ I started having chest pains that imitated a heart attack.  After a hospital stay with a complete heart evaluation_ there was no heart problem found.  The evaluation continued _ with the gall bladder under suspicion.  Still the medication was not suspected by any physician.  The medication was taken until the end of the 13th month.  Three months later with no medication_ the cardiac symptoms returned.  Two days in the hospital with tests showed no cardiac problems.  The medication was restarted for a return of the UTI after being off a total of 8 months.  Problems started soon thereafter with symptoms pointing to the gall bladder. Still the medicine was not suspected by a,My Urologist prescribes this medicine often_ and most patients have no problem with it.  My case was a rare occurance_ but it has been a living hell.  My recommendation is that the taking of this medicine over a long period of time (months) should be with close monitoring by the physician prescribing it.  When a rare catastrophe hits a patient_ it's not rare to the victim_ and the physical damage could be permanent.,F,81,13  months,1/16/2007,Nitrofurantoin
