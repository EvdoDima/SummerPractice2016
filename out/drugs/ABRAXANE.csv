0, 2, Breast cancer,I was on a trial that was testing abraxane for breast cancer in hopes of shrinking my large Breast tumor prior to the double masectomy that I recently had. They gave me AC chemo after the 12 doses of abraxane and when we hit the 15 mark we were seeing that the tumor was getting larger so they took me off the chemo and moved up surgery to get it out. The side effects from the abraxane were hair loss_ bone pain_ my legs felt very heavy and I lost my mind  and learned that their is such a thing as chemo brain!,,F,48,12  weeks 1X W,2/15/2012Email,Abraxane
