0, 4, Chronic lower back pain,In the beginning there was some dizziness_ nausea but you get used to it.  Does cause chronic constipation so you need to be careful of that.  I do get skin irritations and sometimes run out of places to rotate the patch.  Putting a steriod nasal spray in the area first does help a lot.  I use 3M Tegaderm to cover patches if they fall off or if I go swimming.  Overall_ this has been a life changer.  I think more doc's should prescribe this over some of the oral med choices.,Butrans has allowed me to get my life back.  I take 200 mg of Lyrica and 2x 50 mg tramadoil a day.  This is about a 60% pain reduction as long as I don't stand too much or do a lot of housework.  The pain pills were such a nightmare and the up and down of pain mAnagement was terrible on Vicodin.  The patch allows for more steady dosing.  Like everyone else on this board and other's_ these patches really only provide a max 5 days of relief.  I am thankful that my doctor allows me to change them early to avoid additional breakthrough med's.  Most people have still not heard of Butran's and I think it could be helpful to other chronic pain people.  Less chance for abuse.  I have let the manufacturer know that these do not last 7 days.  They said it was based on clinical trials and the doctor can prescribe accordingly up to the max dose.  This doesn't work though because insurance denies it and pharmacies won't break open boxes.  I had to do a lot of fighting for my exception.  I hope others contact the manufacturer to let them know they do not last 7 days as well.,F,44,3  years15 1X D,3/21/2016,Butrans
1, 5, Chronic pain fr.lupus_ fibromyalgia,Severe itching if I sweat under patch_ pimple-like bumps and sores in the adhesive area,"Was on opiates for 10 years_ with all the usual side effects. Since dr. switched me to Butrans_ no more depression_  constipation or feelings of withdrawal and breakthrough pain between doses. Also_ improvement of insomnia. I have 24-hr pain mgmt_ I don't have to worry about people knowing I have opiates in my possession_ no more hyperalgesia_ plus side effects are negligible aside from the itching and sores_ which dr. RX'd a steroid nasal spray to apply prior to a new patch and if it starts to itch while patch is on. Only have issue with medicine running out of patch before the end of 7 days during the summer when I sweat more. I agree with other reviewers_ for the sake of our skin and efficacy_ this patch needs to be a 3 or 5 day. Be aware of uninformed medical personnel: when I had gall bladder surgery_ I repeatedly said ""nothing stronger than Tylenol"" for post-op pain mgmt_ however_ that was ignored and I was given intravenous hydrocodone_ making me sick as a dog. Also_ I declined the written RX for it upon discharge_ but it was handed to my husband anyway.",F,41,2  years20mcg/hr 1X W,10/16/2015Email,Butrans
2, 4, Chronic back pain,Rash at site with itching. Not bad.Does not last 7 days. Runs out at 4to5 days.I hope they make a 5 day patch soon.For now I have up to 8 norcos on day 5_6 an 7,,M,52,5  months20mcg,12/22/2014Email,Butrans
3, 4, Chronic severe pain,The patch leaves a thick medicine burn at placement spot with blisters and the itching is nerve wrecking.,The 10 mcg patch gave me substantial relief for the first three weeks. It only lasts four to five days. Since the patch is creating such a medicine burn to my skin_ I'm going to start on Zohydro 30mg twice a day. I suffered a crush injury to foot that led to progressive arthritis and sural nerve resection that has left me with severe relentless burning. I also had a latissimus muscle transfer to shoulder after 2 failed revisions. The shoulder is full of arthritis also. I use lidoderm patches and cymbalta. I also require Xanax for anxiety due to severe pain.,M,57,4  weeks10 mcg 1X W,3/27/2014Email,Butrans

5, 5, burning nerve pain_ fibromyalgia,sometimes a small rash in application site after removal_ sometimes a little itchy while wearing it,This was added to manage breakthru pain.  I agree with the other reviewer - it does seem to wear down before the change date.  Butrans has made the exhausting pain manageable_ but it is still not completely gone.  I use this in addition to Cymbalta: 60mg/at bedtime_ Tramadol: 50mg/ 3x daily_ Meloxicam: 7.5mg/ 2x daily_ Tizanidine: 4mg/ 2x daily.  My joints still burn_ my feet are still numb.  I HATE taking pills but I can mentally function.  Radiating paid down both legs keeps me from walking_ but I am extremely lucky - I've kept my job_ I can work at home.  I have something to be thankful for!  Good luck to everyone suffering from the same or similar.,F,40,5  months10 mg/hr 1X W,3/7/2013Email,Butrans
6, 5, Chronic pain,Works as well or better than 100mcg Duragesic without the side affects. The only drawback is that it does not last 7 days and checks out quickly on the 4-5th day.  It also starts to work immediately unlike the duragesic which takes at least 8 hrs to get in your system.,I feel so much better on this medicine and can complete daily tasks without the sedation and side affects from regular opiate medication.,F,52,2  months20mcg 1X W,11/27/2012Email,Butrans
