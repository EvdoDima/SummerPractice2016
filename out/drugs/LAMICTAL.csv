0, 1, Bp2,Only took one tablet. Already taking sertraline for depression. I reacted badly. Within an hour of taking it I was filled with extreme anger and hatred towards myself! I was head butting things. Punching myself. I was wanted to seriously hurt myself. Had thought of stabbing my self in the leg and kept scratching my face! At one point I was sitting on the floor crying and rocking uncontrollably about 6 hours later after taking the tablet I suddenly became a dribbling mess. Slurring speech. Movements uncoordinated and very numb. Felt really tired. For two days walking shuffling the feet and all movements are slow. Speech is still slurring. I'm an ex junkie and I have taken lots of illegal drugs in the past and NONE of them made me feel like this one has. Never taking them again!,,F,44,1  days25mg,7/14/2016,Lamictal

8, 2, Depressive disorder,My experience with Lamictol was not good. I started with 25 mg and was told to titrate up to 50mg. This medicine made me so tired. I also noticed I felt numb. No feelings at all. The feeling I would get is anger but unable to let it out. I lowered back to 25 mg for a week or so them stopped cold turkey. Well I am on 2 weeks without it. Not feeling great thats for sure. Your tired in it_ but exhausted off it. I feel I have become depressed again_ but know its due to withdrawal so am trying to accept it. I did have a headache for about 10 days. I notice I am feeling anger_ not that I am an angry person normally_ but have issues in my life that are making me angry and withdrawal is exacerbating these feelings. I have come close to going back on it for some relief from fatigue_ but gonna push through it. I would rather feel life than be numb.,Not good.

9, 5, Mood Stabilizer,Muscle aches in the beginning which lasted approximately 4 weeks. Photosensitivity that has increasingly become more bothersome.,"I have experienced periods of depression for as long as I can remember even as a child. However_ I was not treated for it until my 20s when I was diagnosed with postpartum depression after my 3rd child. My OB prescribed welbutrin which did absolutely nothing. Overtime the symptoms went away (or either I just dealt with it). I was in a toxic marriage that ended in a nasty divorce and my depression was accompanied with extreme mood swings and short periods of manic episodes. My PCP prescribed me Xanax which helped a lot but became addictive and I began making bad decisions while taking it. It made me feel like ""I just don't care"" which was much better than feeling out if control at the time but just didn't work for me because I had small children to take care of so I stopped taking it. I felt out of control for years and the people I loved the most walked on eggshells because they never knew what type of mood I was going to be in. Then I discovered ""weed"" in my late 20s early 30s. It was a miracle drug. I functioned better in high stressed situations_ including at work and I was actually a pleasant person to be around. I smoked marijuana in the morning before my kids woke up_ on my lunch break and before I went to bed. I finally felt like a normal human being until I accepted a higher paying position in my company that required random drug testing because I was working with people who operated heavy equipment. I made the decision to stop smoking weed because",F,36,3  years100mg,4/6/2016,Lamictal

No help in stabilizing mood.,Tapering down 2-5 mg every 2-3 months for two years now.

I would not recommend Lamictal to anyone on this planet_ for any reason. It is pure poison. The fact that I am off of it is a miracle I thank God for every day. There is permanent_ serious damage from Lamictal_ to be sure. I am so grateful to be free of this evil drug.,F,44,10  years200 mg,2/2/2016,Lamictal
22, 5, Bipolar NOS & Self Injury Addiction,Sleepy during the day_ otherwise no adverse side effects. Wears off over the span of years. Take at night. Do not miss a dose--take every day or else you will have a huge withdrawl hangover.,This medication saved my life. I started this medication in 2006 soon after being diagnosed with Bipolar NOS_ also carrying in-tow a crippling self-injury addiction. I was not stable_ my mood swings were uncontrollable_ razors controlled my life_ and I am still so thankful I didn't kill myself before finding help.I spend around 3-4 months trying medication after medication to stabalize me_ but absolultly nothing was working. I was finally put on this medication (i did not get a rash even though I went straight up to a high dose)_ and it was immediately like night-and-day for me. I suddenly wasn't a slave to my emotional state_ and my thoughts became more clear instead of being muffled. This medication gave me clarity when I had absolutely none.Of course_ medication cannot cure addictions or change the way you think_ but lamotrigine (I take the generic) gave me the stability I needed to start the process of quitting and the mental sharpness to see logic and sanilty when I was considering cutting. Otherwise_ the craving just consumed everything. After only being on this medication for maybe 4-6 months and was put on 30mg abilify to 'seal the deal' if you will_ I had cut down from cutting 2-4 times every single day to cutting once every 2-3 weeks. That was a huge deal for a stressed out_ self-conscious high schooler like me.At around the 8th year_ I had a huge mental illness/SI relapse while in college.

24, 2, Epilepsy,Aggression getting worse as the dose seems to increase.,I really cannot explain as its my son who have mad episodes of aggression as he has a intellectual disability. As he cant tell me how he's feeling and I can't pick up what is wrong with him. We have done tests from MRI_ Renal_ eyes and dental which were all clear. Since he started at a low dose on Lamictal at 25mg he continued to have seizures but as we increased to 50mg he then became moody. Increasing now to 100mg its controlled the seizures but his aggression is worsening to the point where he throws his head back anywhere from wall to floor. As he wears a helmet at all times it doesn't keep him safe. Once he's in this aggression mood I cannot control him otherwise he's on a attack to me or whomever is trying to calm him. Feeling scared sometimes that he's going to really hurt himself or others. Spoken to specialist but they say it will pass overtime.,M,22,2  years100 1X D,1/19/2016Email,Lamictal

26, 1, Depression/anxiety,Anxiety_worsened depression_ stiff neck_ flu like_ sore throat_ lowered immune system_ hip pain_ urination_ dry skin_ stuffy nose_ insomnia_ headaches_ memory issues_ hair graying/loss. I think the ceo's of companies caught hiding negative info about their drugs should get life in prison/death penalty. The whole system is corrupt IMHO.,I was on this briefly years ago with reasonable results...but that was the name brand. I started to develop some depression due partly to a partner that had anger/control issues. Started taking this again but this time it was generic Teva which is beyond garbage. It caught me off guard because I didn't realize generic meds are a joke and it made everything much worse_ it lowered my immune system so much that getting a cold felt like pneumonia.I constantly felt like I was on the verge of getting a cold or fly and had no idea that the drug was causing this at all_ especially when it worked pretty good before. I firmly believe all generic meds should be thoroughly tested and not just given the green light because of the brand name being approved. The other problem is I think GSK has some info about this med that they never released to the public and with their horrific track record of corruption_ no one should be surprised. I'm also a firm believer that psychiatry is the dirty secret of medicine and the way dangerous meds are approved there is zero interest in public safety. If you look at the side effects of this med you see only occasional reports of memory loss or hair loss but _ reading the reviews of actual people taking it you see a completely different story.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that someone must be hiding the truth about these meds because you don't see hair loss listed as a common side effect but it seems to come up here pretty often...,M,41,2  years,1/5/2016,Lamictal
27, 3, Bipolar II,Did a gradual step up to 100 MG and after a couple weeks at 100 MG I started to feel crazy.

28, 1, Panic Disorder_ GAD_ Mood disorder,Nausea_ appetite loss_ nightmares_ dizziness_ sweating_ blurry vision_ dry mouth_ brain fog increased anxiety and irritability,HORRIBLE drug for panic disorder and anxiety in general.

31, 5, Depression and anxiety,Hair loss,I've been on lamictal for months now_ and it is so far the only drug that has helped my depression. I was on 500 mg up until a few weeks ago_ when I noticed that I had lost a huge amount of hair right above my forehead. In certain lights it looks like I'm balding_ awful. So my psych decreased my dose and added Wellbutrin. Honestly_ I would rather lose every single hair on my head than be on Wellbutrin_ which has been a nightmare. I think I will probably ask my psych to just put me back on lamictal. Again_ the only drug that has helped me. It's been a life saver.,F,22,8  months300 mg,12/2/2015Email,Lamictal
32, 5, bp2,Eating constantly and diariah. Vivid dreams.,I have tried to commit suicide several times on paxil_lexipro and Zoloft. Almost succeeded on paxil. Clinically dead for 43 minutes which is unheard of without some extreme damage. GOD WAS THERE FOR ME ABD MY FAMILY. I too have done some truly disturbing things to myself and others that I hold very dear to me. Would go in major depression after my manic disruption. Hated myself to a large degree. Anyway_ this medication has made me enjoy small things that people take for granted in their lives because it comes second nature to then rather then our troubles. I enjoy getting out of bed. Making my bed and keeping a nice clean house. Enjoy my daughter and never miss a moment now. This disorder can make you become selfish..... NO MORE!!!

42, 3, Bipolar mood swings,Large amount of weight gain in a small amount of time. Felt very tired. Messed up my blood sugar. Weird dreams. Trouble sleeping. Swollen limbs. Tender breasts (also went up a cup size),Weird medicine! It's a shame_ because both me and my family noticed a huge difference on only 100mg of lamictal. I wasn't easily angered_ I was calm and happy go lucky... Positive_ and my manics were under control. BUT I also gained 30lbs in 2 months!!! With no change in diet... My blood sugar was always wack and had me feeling horrible. I always felt tired and lethargic but yet had trouble sleeping. I thought I was having a pregnancy scare but noticed that tender (larger breasts) were a side effect... I believe this drug also had me retain water and be swollen! It could work if you don't have horrible side effects...,F,26,2  months100mg,9/4/2015,Lamictal
43, 4, Epilepsy,Lamictal has helped with the seizures but it sucks I have to be on it the rest of my life. It interferes with my sex drive_ I'm always tired and now I've started having constant headaches. I'm not sure if the constant headache is due to the medicine but I'm not feeling it.

I can make logical connections to conditions presented with the software I test but only if I focus really hard.  I can handle the dizziness by dragging my finger across the wall as I'm walking but the rest is hard to take without being nervous about keeping my job.  I was on a website about overcoming the side effects of medication and one tiny line said there was evidence that cells in bad shape from poor diet and whatever else we've been doing to ourselves increased side effects.

50, 3, Bipolar depression,Tempted to rate it a 2 due to the side effects: weight gain_ fatigue_ stiff neck_ disrupted sleep_ change in voice_ constant yawning.,Worked by stabilizing my manic episodes. Bit researched side effects and weight gain was my most feared one_ as I had always been overweight_ but over the past decade I had lost almost 80 lbs_ even considered myself athletic. I had gained tiny amounts back prior to med_ but it shot up 50+ lbs in the time I've been on it. I had taken welbutrin in the beginning with it_ but had psychotic episodes_ so came off that. Lamotrigine is only one I'm on now_ and I'm fatigued all the time_ with food control and cravings thru the roof.  Now I'm reading so many comments on here that say they've had weight gain_ even tho my Dr assured me this was very uncommon. Maybe they need to do a new study on symptoms then. Could my wt gain have been exasperated while in this med because of my preexisting eating disorder? Sadly_now the wt gain has made me even more depressed. I think my manic episodes are controlled now_ but I miss those days because I was able to go nuts in my workouts and get my house cleaned_ get my groceries... Now afraid to go off med because of poss withdrawal possibilities. A co-worker show father tried Lamotrigine for his BP almost died from the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Had to be treated as a burn victim because his skin essentially sloughed off_including his insides.

The rash started after my 6th dose and I saw my psychiatrist immediately and was told to discontinue immediately as the rash is potentially life threatening.  He trialed me on it again 10 days later and the rash came back with dose 1. I know this is rare_ only .01% of people get it from this medication but it is life threatening_ your organs are systematically shutting down.

53, 1, Absence Seizures/Complex Partial,At age 17 I was put on 100mg Lamictal monothepary for a seizure disorder . I had a  hallucination in the supermarket one day_ went back to the neurologist thinking it was the Lamictal. He disagreed and said it was normal for seizure patients. Before university I returned to NYU to discuss what i felt were side effects of the Lamictal and again he dismissed it and increased dose to 400mg daily_ sighting I needed control during university life. The 400 mg made me unable to get out of bed_ extreme fatigue_ cognitive issues when reading ( the words would flip from what I saw in the book to what my mind was processing) I knew this was incorrect but could not explain. Lecturers did not care to understand. I gain weight (50 lbs in 2 years) no matter how much diet or exercise. I broke out in cystic acne and my moods became very aggressive and suicidal. I had to drop of university as i was in a scholarship program and could no longer maintain my grades. We weaned  off the Lamictal 25mg per week,,F,24,5  years200 mg 2X D,6/30/2015Email,Lamictal

62, 1, Bipolar,Seizures,Seizure meds should never be prescribed for bipolar yet doctors keep insisting in trying them for mood swings before resorting to antipsychotics. This med made no difference in my moods at all_ no improvement for bipolar_ it was like I was taking a placebo. However_ I have never had seizures in my entire life but when I started taking this I started having small seizures that continued long after I stopped taking it. I was tested for epilepsy and brain abnormalities and 3 years of constant testing revealed that I DID NOT have a seizure disorder_ so I started getting unexplained seizures after using this med and have them still to this day. Docs still cannot explain why I have them_ but they did not stop and I started having grand mal seizures until I started taking Neurontin for anxiety which is also good for seizures I have been told.,F,29,2  months60mg 2X D,5/6/2015,Lamictal

I have no such problems in the daytime (in fact I'm always cold_ but that's been for my entire life).  Also sometimes difficulty concentrating_ jumbling words (ex. saying ""darn bore"" instead of ""barn door"") fairly often when speaking_ mistakes spelling/writing/typing.  Very rarely I experience one night of insomnia which I never experienced off Lamictal; was always able to fall asleep pretty quickly.  Also occasionally have dry mouth_ which doesn't concern me much_ but I did have a salivary gland infection after wisdom teeth surgery_ which my doctor said was caused by dry mouth from the Lamictal.",I used to take 150 mg of Lamictal for mood stabilization during a major depressive episode in addition to Lexapro (SSRI's alone make me hypomanic). I took Lamictal for approx. 4 years with success. When I decided on my own to discontinue after feeling my life was stable_ I immediately felt irritable.  I thought this would subside_ but at times it flared again to the point I was experiencing rage and agitation_ so eventually_ 3 years later_ I asked my PCP to try Lamictal again. He RX 100 mg (50 mg bid). I had originally attributed the night sweats to Lexapro_ but nope_ turns out it's Lamictal (no nightmares_ however_ that was Lexapro). My moods have been better; less explosive irritability_ less argumentative_ no rage_ less intense emotions_ calmer. However I still have periods of hypomania (maybe twice a year for 6-12 weeks)_ and some lower moods_ but nothing approaching depression. 100 mg isn't a very large dose_ but it works well enough.  And I've had no loss of sex drive or pleasure_ unlike when I was on Lexapro and Lamictal together.,F,30,18  months50 mg 2X D,4/28/2015,Lamictal

I got very depressed_ gained 20+ pounds (which it is very hard for me to gain weight) was extremely suicidal. This is was after my medication was bumped up to 100MG. I have been currently off my medication and feeling a lot better than when I was on it. I would not recommend taking this drug.

70, 5, Bipolar II,Drymouth,If you're bipolar - why are you on Lithium on first diagnosis without trying this treatment first? It took me a few years to figure this out. Bottom line is... It's my mood stabilizer. It may not be for everyone_ but in ten years of treatment for seven straight it has been my foundation. Of course_ everyone's chemistry is different_ but this is it. I use an anti-psychotic before sleep called Seroquel_ and take Lamictal first thing in the morning. Folks_ life couldn't be more manageable. Where I used to look up and see rafters from which to hang myself from_ I walk along and recognize some cool beams that might accent an awesome living space. But enough exaggeration_ the fact is that I notice when I skip this treatment.To you_ out there_ recognize that it's good enough_ it's not toxic enough (like Lithium)_ and dog-gone it_ this just might work for you after a 90-day trial!,M,37,3  years300 1X D,4/7/2015,Lamictal

73, 4, Bipolar II,Still titrating up to 200 mg. At first I itched more than usual_ dry mouth_ some fine tremors in my hands. Absolutely dead tired in the afternoons for the first month. Better now. First few weeks woke every night at either 2 am sharp or 5 am sharp and it took about an hour to fall back to sleep. Sweets and chocolate started tasting *more*. My blood pressure was slightly elevated for a few weeks_ has settled down now. Experienced chills for about two days when going from 25 -> 50 mg.,None of the side-effects above have been a great nuisance_ with the exception of maybe the itching. It took about two or three weeks before I started noticing that things around the house got done in a way they hadn't been for probably a year. My depressive symptoms that have squashed me for the past two years always leaned more towards the incredibly tired_ lethargic and unmotivated side of the spectrum anyway_ and that is what has slowly changed. I no longer feel like I need to sleep 10-11 hours to feel remotely ready to get out of bed. I manage to get things done_ like the laundry and the dishes after cooking. I am also way more productive at work. I was prescribed 150 mg Bupropion three months before being dx'ed with BP2 and have continued with that after consulting with my bp doctor. My base level energy lifted with the Bupropion and has continued even closer to normal levels with the addition of the Lamo. I'm feeling really hopeful about this. Was misdiagnosed for 8 years with unipolar depression and treated with only SSRIs_ which only increased my depressions and the frequency of the mood swings.,F,40,6  weeks75 mg 1X D,3/24/2015,Lamictal
74, 4, Bipolar 2 disorder,No side effects so far.,I was diagnosed with Type 2 bipolar disorder in my late 40s. My weight is 190 lbs. Taking 200 mg lamotrigine with breakfast for about three weeks now. Experiencing little to no side effects. My dreams are more vivid and sometimes bizarre_ but not nightmarish. Feeling pleased with this medicine. Also been taking Wellbutrin for the past year. Prior to my bipolar diagnosis I went through four SSRI antidepressants (Paxil_ Zoloft_ Celexa_ and Lexapro). Each of these meds pushed me into mania to varying degrees. While on SSRIs and manic_ I created three unwanted pregnancies_ got busted for drugs_ developed a cigarette habit_ quit several good jobs for petty reasons_ became a heavy drinker_ had short and failed relationships with women_ spent money foolishly_ and went bankrupt. Mine is one of the sad stories of people who went untreated/misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and proceeded to cause a lot of hardship for myself and others. To this day I still feel shame for my failures_ yet at the same time I berate myself less since understanding the cause of my past behavior. My cigarette habit went away after I switched from SSRIs to Wellbutrin. Now I feel healthier and grateful. No cravings whatsoever. I take 1 mg Ativan as needed; about every one to six days. I wish I received my bipolar diagnosis 20+ years ago as my life might be very different now. I still have many years left if all goes well_ so better late than never.,M,48,2  months200 mg 1X D,3/16/2015,Lamictal
75, 5, Bipolar ll,Lamictal needs to be done in a titration. For those that give a negative rating_ had only been on it a few weeks or months. It is started out at a very low dose (25mg) and SLOWLY worked up to 200mg. Doctors will never start someone at a high dose because the fatal rash that it my cause.,I LOVE lamictal! I have tried seroqual and depakote. Lamictal curves my manic and brings me out of my depression. It actually gives me energy. When I first started out taking it_ I was hungry all the time a little tired_ but now I have energy_ my appetite is less. I really enjoy this medication.,F,21,6  months200mg,3/10/2015Email,Lamictal
76, 5, Bipolar II with psychosis,Drowsiness_ stiff neck_ occasional itching_ constipation_ weight gain.,This medication has been the only one that consistently has worked for me since I have been diagnosed. I have had to add other medications at times when I was going through seasonal mood changes_ but overall this has been enough. My biggest complaint would have been the drowsiness.  But after sometime my doctor decided since it was hard for me to wake up and take it in the morning and not be drowsy_ I take my entire dose at night before I go to sleep. That way I sleep through it and it helps me fall asleep. I have always had a bad back_ but this medication definitely increased the pain. Sometimes it feel like it is too much to bare so I am looking into getting a massage therapist still. Constipation I have struggled with too most of my life and this medication increased that also. I would have to take a laxative once a week to have a bowel movement. Now that I changed my diet_ I started juicing veggies and I take stool softeners_ it is almost regular again. I cut out dairy products too. The weight gain was really hard to deal with. From when I started taking the medication_ I gained about 25 lbs. my weight fluxiates quite a bit. I am only 15 lbs over my starting weight right now. It just makes me feel hungry all the time. Even if my stomach feels like it is going to burst I still want to eat. It has been hard trying to overcome that. But you just have to look at it this way_ is it better to be medicated_ feel almost normal and have side effects_ or live being ridiculously emo,F,22,3  years300mg,2/18/2015Email,Lamictal

However_ I have fibromyalgia and the pain started coming back so it was suggested by my pdoc that I go back on the Lamictal. Not trusting in my own experiences and thinking perhaps it had been something else that caused my past suffering_ I started it again. And guess what? All of the symptoms returned. Sure doctors are educated but there's a lot they don't know. The long term affects of these drugs aren't known. Many drugs have helped me -- I couldn't hold a normal life without them. But be aware.

Im also starting to lose weight too! So for me its a wonder drug. Im not taking any other meds. Lamictal (generic) also destroyed my depression.

Cry very easily. Itchy ski_ The incontinence was a major and embarrassing issue. It's the main reason I got off of lamictal. FYI: lamictal is the only med I was taking and no other life changes were made. So its safe to say my symptoms/side-effects were the cause of Lamictal. Furthermore_ I reduced 25mil a week until I was completely off. The withdrawal symptoms were mainly insomnia_ headache_ moodiness_ a feeling of fear_ hard to get out of bed_ very tired. Once I was up and about I felt pretty normal. The moodiness did last throughout the day. I've been off for about 3 weeks now med free and doing great! Withdrawal symptoms are gone.,,M,41,3  years250ml,4/18/2014Email,Lamictal

I already take Seroquel which puts weight on some people and it's never done that to me.  Maybe it was the combo.

116, 1, treatment-resistant depression,I thought this was my miracle drug for depression but unfortunately like all other treatments eventually it failed me. After about 6 weeks I noticed it wasn't helping much with my depression anymore. I also noticed that I was excessively sleepy and would need naps every single day. It was like an overwhelming exhaustion came over me every day and there was no way I could avoid needing to nap. I also had extreme joint pain in my lower back and hips_ and more pain in my knees and ankles. I attributed the excessive sleeping and hip/back pain to the fact that I have MS_ and thought I was having pain in my knees and ankles because I'm overweight. Turns out that all of those symptoms were caused by the Lamictal and went away when I stopped taking it.

I was 176 pounds and now I weigh 133 that's a 43 drop and my body is not suppose to be 133; I look sick.  I also suffer from bad Ache which I am now on an ache medicine to help. I have blurred vision which I thought was from me having Lasik surgery and come to find out it is another side effect of Lamictal.  The drug seems to have helped with my mood swings I just can't take the side effects any longer.  I look sick and when people see me they seem uncomfortable around me_ I can only imagine what they are thinking. I have had to use the excuse that I am on Weight Watchers that's why I have lost so much weight(I don't think that it is anyone's biz that I am bipolar). I wish I didn't suffer from almost all of the side effects that Lamictal has...I guess I should be happy that I didn't get the terrible rash that it can cause. Hopefully once I am off of Lamictal and it has left my system some of my weight will come back_ my hair will stop falling out_ my vision will become clear and my ache will go away.

I felt great for one day...and then started on this one and started to feel like crap within hours.  My very first night_ could not sleep for the first time in years and it has been this way since. Headaches and body aches started within about 48 hours and anxiety and weepy within the past two days. My doctor has me at a slow titration and this current dose is just a quarter of what my full dose will be.

I was misdiagnosed bipolar and put on it so the Celexa I was taking and had been taking for years wouldn't send me 'manic'. Because it turns out I really only have unipolar depression I think that was the problem I had with Lamictal. I was on it a total of 8 weeks and they were the worst 8 weeks of my life. It seemed to negate the Celexa and sent me into the worst depression ever. I had to go into a mental ward and am still getting life back on track.

It helped me sleep_ took care of my moods_ I was stable_ my anxiety was gone. It was wonderful. I had some interesting side effects which I thought I could live with until I discovered swollen glands. My pdoc never heard of it before_ so I went to the doctor and had several tests done just to be told I am perfectly healthy and I need to stop taking the drug. The withdrawal of this drug is SO bad it felt like I was dying. It shot me off so badly into the deep end_ I am now far worse than I was BEFORE I took the drug. I still experience insomnia (though my pdoc now put me on valproate 400mg and seroquel 50mg which does wonders for the insomnia) but my anxiety is really bad and my eye vision is not what it used to be (i struggle to move my eyes quickly). My lymph nodes are STILL not gone which terrifies me and I probably have to go back and get more tests done (not sure what more they can do AS I AM PERFECTLY HEALTHY). I advise strong caution when using this drug_ or considering using it. It can work great for some but completely terrible for others. It's a very dependent drug and the addiction is bad.

Didn't dull me out like several others I tried (Depakote ER_ Zyprexa_ Trileptal_ Tegretol)_ and after about 2 weeks after starting it I noticed just an overall improvement in my mood.  Didn't propel me into a manic state_ just an overall brighter attitude and outlook on things.

I was given a starter pack and slowly increased to 100 mgs. It works great for that problem. Has kept it stable and no more issues.,F,38,90  days100 1X D,10/20/2012,Lamictal
157, 3, Bipolar 2 and Depression,Jaw clenching_ severe insomnia_ over heating_ increased sweating_ frequent nausea_ muscle ticks,I have been taking Lamictal for about 6 months now for my Bipolar type 2 and depression in conjunction with Effexor which I was on for about 4 years.  I am happy with my over all mood this drug has been wonderful for that.  I never felt quite right just taking the Effexor.  However_ the awful jaw clenching_ biting my tongue in my sleep_ nausea_ and severe insomnia have me seriously reconsidering taking this medication.  I can't decide if these side effects are worth the result in my mood stabilization.  This is very unfortunate as a mother of two I have issues with my patience sometimes.  I will be consulting my doctor as I have been up all night due to severe jaw pain and insomnia_ I just can't take it anymore :(,F,28,6  months200 1X D,10/16/2012,Lamictal

At this moment in time I feel as if this drug has ruined my life! I had problems with depression and stabilizing my moods before taking Lamictal_ but I was relatively sane compared to how I am now. Firstly_ I am very empty and feel that my existence is zombie-like. I don't have any sense of compassion or sympathy. I've been with my boyfriend for almost ten months and we had such a strong relationship before this medicine_ but now we almost go our seperate ways three times+ a day because I never seem to be able to make up my mind. I was paranoid that he was going to leave me prior to Lamictal_ but now the tables have turned completely and he's trying to keep a hold on me but I fear I'm going to do something stupid. I go from loving him_ being so infatuated_ convinced we're going to have a future to doubt that we're going to last and I'm unsure if I love him or even care about him at all. It's a horrible thing to admit and I'm ashamed I don't have a grasp on my own emotions anymore. I am so confused and just want to remember how I felt before taking this terrible medicine. I was so sure that I was going to become a fitness trainer/nutritionist_ and carefully controlled what I consumed as well as tried to keep fit...I had DREAMS...GOALS! But now_ I don't even attempt to stay healthy or trim. No career seems to appeal to me_ and nothing really entertains me anymore.

I've also noticed orgasms come quicker and more frequently.  My moods have been more level and my actions_ which previously were often dictated by emotions_ are easier to control.  I have recently come off Buspar/Zoloft combination due to agitation (mixed state?)_ increased paranoia_ and hypomania.  I don't believe my diagnosis is bi-polar_ but more like depression that cannot be treated with SSRIs.  On the Zoloft_ I had little ability to orgasm_ so the libido change is drastic.

192, 4, Bipolar Disorder II,I am posting this because I feel I need to warn people about the withdrawal symptoms of this drug.  Yes_ it does help stablize my moods (did give me some sense of no emotion though)_ but what they did not tell me is that it is very psychologically and physically addictive.,"If you ever stop taking this drug_ do so very slowly and expect it to be difficult.  Physically_ I've experienced severe nausea_ fatigue and headaches.  I am having excruciating pain in my shoulders and back and my vision seems to be blurry.  Psychologically_ I had sudden_ very intrusive violent suicidal thoughts_ a feeling of being disconnected from my body_ being ""in a fog"" so severely that I can't comprehend what people are saying to me_ weird thoughts and a sudden onset of paranoia.  This has happened so suddenly (i.e._ in a day) that I am attributing it to the med withdrawal and not the disorder itself.  My moods are still relatively stable as the meds aren't out of my system yet.  I just feel like I'm completely losing my mind.

195, 4, Bipolar1 and PTSD,Had success on this med several years ago but stopped due to rash. Being desperate am trying med again.  I had rash again and stopped but now retrying with no rash so far.  Dry mouth can be problem and can wreck havoc on the gums/teeth.  Take precaution if you have problem.  Otherwise only med other than trileptal that has helped without devastating side-effects.,I suffer from severe depressions for the most part and mixed states.  This med helped with the illness several years ago and I have seen positive effects again. Most docs try to get patients up to 200mg.  For me I have done best at 100mgs. I also notice that the drug affects me quickly at 25mgs in a very positive way.  Bipolar has robbed me_ as it has most of you reading this_ of a life.  It is worth it to me to risk the rash and not to panic if I get one again. Most rashes are not of the fatal variety_ but of course the docs know what they are doing in stopping the med and there are other meds.  I recommend Trileptal if you are having rash trouble and cannot tolerate depakote_ lithium_ etectera. But for me I am not stopping at first sign of a rash. I will treat it as a typical rash if possible. That may be crazy but They say I have bipolar disorder anyway. So listen to the Docs not me. I'd be interested in hearing about your experience especially if you had a rash and you were able to continue or if not stopping caused you big problems.  Thanks!

199, 4, Bi Polar II_ Depression,Sluggish_ some weirdness with sleeping_ but got use to it. Really no side effects at all.,Ok here is the key- Titration is a must. I would recommend going up 12.5mgs per week until you get to the therapeutic amount. Also you have a way better chance of avoiding the rash and it also helps you get use to the med slowly. The beautiful thing with this medication is there are virtually no side effects. You hardly feel like you are taking anything after awhile. It definitely helped with some of my manic symptoms_ stress_ and irritability. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it did little for my depression_ it did help me from going into the depths of despair and doom_ but I still feel 70-80% the depression I felt before. I think combined with an antidepressant I will be where I want to be_ never had good luck with SSRI's though. My anxiety levels on Lamictal seem to be a little bit better. I'm going to switch to generic this week because of the cost_ I hope it is as effective. Overall I think it is a well tolerated medication and I highly recommend it_ some people say it really helps with the depressive side.

209, 3, Partial Complex Seizures,WEIGHT GAIN_ headaches_ stiff neck_ memory loss_ insomnia_ FORGETFULLNESS_,I was on Topamax for 2 years and wanted off because it was affecting my personality and making me a zombie. The initial weight loss was awesome. However_ it got to be extreme. I wanted something different. Neurologist put me on Lamictal. I gained some of my weight back which was ok. The problem now is that I have gained .5 lbs EVERY week. I watch everything I put in my mouth and I work out 5 x a week. I have gone to a personal trainer_ thinking I was doing something wrong. Nothing will make the weight come off. A little weight gain would have been fine. The continuing weight gain is really bothersome. Most of that is my vanity speaking though. Aside from that_ I have some massive headaches_ I wake up in the morning stiff and humped over like a 90 y/o. I don't sleep well at night. I get regular massages because of a stiff neck. I cannot remember crap. Some of that relates to the Topamax and seizures in general. I am afraid that my short-term and some of my long-term memory is just gone.

I began tapering off the 200 mg I was on and at 100 mg_ the aches were gone but the depression not only came back but so did slight hypomania in rapid cycling form.  My recommendation is for anyone considering going on this med it to be sure your dr. says ""no substitutes"" on your RX form and gets you the brand name form.  I had came across crazymeds.org and there it is said that the ""Dr. Reddy's"" is so useless_ it's like a placebo.  This med worked great under the BRAND NAME.

250, 5, Bipolar 1,Small bumps on hands when we increased the dosage.,This drug has saved my life.  Seriously.  I had severe manic episodes and two suicide attempts.  We tried anti-psychs with bad results.  Abilify caused seizures; Geodon nearly gave me a heart attack.  You start at a low dose and bump it up at various increments.  The dosage pack makes it easy.  Now that I'm taking the max dosage for bipolar disorder_ my moods are *much* more stable.  I still have episodes of mania and depression_ but that's the nature of the disorder.  If not for Lamictal_ those episodes would likely be much more serious.  I recommend trying this drug to anyone who is having trouble with side effects from anti-psychs.

The rash kept growing even though the fever kept going down. On the third day of the rash (a holiday)_ my neuro sent me to the ER with an all-over body rash. It was just slightly itchy and painful. All the staff kept coming in to look at me because they had never seen a lamictal rash before. The ER sent me home with a prescription for prednisone and the suggestion to put lidocaine on the rash to reduce pain and itchiness.

270, 3, seizure,Memory loss--some long term but mostly short term--lots of trouble with names. Trouble concentrating and reasoning sometimes. Numbness in my face and confusion when I forget a dose. It feels like anesthetic has been injected and the skin on my face is sagging. Low tolerance for stress compared to before I started the med. My job performance has definitely been affected.,The side effects are intermittant--some good days and some not so good. Menopause and stress complicate things. In fact STRESS is a huge factor. I have regained some ability to concentrate since my dad passed away after 6 years of taking care of him. Meditation_ exercising_ not overscheduling myself_ and eating right help. This is literally the only medication I have ever taken_ and it has completely stopped my seizures which started three years ago. So I guess the side effects are better than having seizures. Still_ I am very worried about not being able to work at some point. Right now I depend quite a bit on friends and my students to help me on the bad days. I guess I would give up driving if I could have my brain power back. But I don't know what it would be like to live with seizures. I have a benign brain tumor which is apparently the cause of those. There are risks if I have brain surgery_ principally that the tumor is near my speech center.

I have now been seizure free for 2.5 years. It is interesting to me that the person in the thread who has been on the drug for 17 years also gets the spaced out feeling if the dose is taken late...any other similar experiences? What might cause this?

Muscle aches a couple of times out of the blue that felt like I had been run over by a train. Not sure if that is Lamictal related or not. As for my seizures_ only time will tell if it works.

I still have some mood swings but they are teenie compared to where I was a little over 10 years ago!

I now take it at night & no longer feel tired during the day.  The ""hives"" have gotten better_ and I use a toothpaste & mouth-rinse for sensitive teeth.  Also_ I got a nightguard which REALLY helped the aching teeth & jaw-clenching.  I bought one of those cheap ones at a drugstore and it works great.

I did not experience that with Lamictal_ but I did have a similar experience with amitryptline and zanaflax or something like that. I didn't feel I had any emotional side-effects with Lamictal_ which is one reason I liked it. (With others I can notice a sharp descent into depression.) It's very important that readers know that each individual will react differently to medications. I tried lots of different meds for back pain_ but when I combined lamictal with ultram_ I was able to tolerate my pain and yet be able to function. I think the idea is that it controls muscle seizures in your back or something (and of course the effect on the brain chemicals). Everything else just made me feel depressed or way too tired. I like to be alert and awake_ and will tolerate some pain in exchange for being able to have a life. It's interesting that I've read about lamictal and hormones_ because I'm just starting pre-menopause and I feel like my lamictal side effects of the numbness and tingling are getting stronger.  I'm considering having my doctor wean me off this to see how I do. Probably will. But_ I did want to post my positive experience with this drug and back pain so other might consider it. I would recommend giving it a try - and if it doesn't work - just go off it. But make sure you wean yourself on and off_ it makes a difference.

My doc admitted 2 years into it that I was not really bipolar.  I feel like I was used as a guinea pig. I don't understand why anyone who DOES NOT suffer from seizures should take this drug. It makes you two levels dumber.  I used to be very good at expressing myself verbally and now I have trouble with it.  I started this medication three years before law school and ended it right around the time I started school. I am just finishing law school and could definitely tell the difference in my memory problems when I started studying.  For those of you who say the memory loss/trouble finding words is not a problem--just wait_ at some point it will be.  Then_ you will realize what you traded for the calming/numbing feeling of Lamictal. I didn't think it was a problem at first because my life was not very demanding at the time.  However_ now_ I'm horrified at the thought that the memory problems are permanent.  What's even more infuriating is I stopped the drug very abruptly and nothing happened.  I was not depressed_ anxious_ scared...etc  I was actually completely NORMAL!!!  What a damn waste of brain cells.  Be careful people!!!  This drug is for people who suffer from seizures...it is supposed to decrease the activity in your brain.  Just because it makes people with bipolar feel better doesn't make it the right drug if the trade off is your intelligence.

I weened myself off Lexapro for the same reason_ and it has been difficult in losing the weight_ but after 2 months_ my metabolism is evening out and I'm losing - but VERY slowly.  I have to work twice as hard for every pound.  I watch everything I eat_ I work out 4-5 times a week_ etc.  Now_ I'm weeing off of Lamictal for similar reasons.  Plus_ I'm getting breakthrough depression anyways.  It has helped some in the way of mood balance_ but I'm' never really happy_ always forgetful_ and as an engineer in my days before Lamictal I had fantastic recall.  Now_ my memory is shot_ and I've had to take a job at my family's business because they know they have to repeat things to me.  It is embarrasing.  However_ I am working hard on that as well.  If I knew this medication was going to rob me of my memory and pack on the lbs that would be so difficult to lose_ I would have NEVER taken this medicine.  My doctor NEVER warned me of these side effects.  My old doctor put me on this with the misdiagnosis that I was bipolar_ my new doctor read all of my history_ and said I was misdiagnosed. So_ I'm weeing myself off this drug as well and substituting it with the overwhelming research on the anti-depression characteristics of Fish Oil.

Pro: Periods are lighter and cramping is a lot less painful.,My story is similar to that of many others who have been misdiagnosed with having and anxiety and depression_ instead of bipolar 2 disorder. I used to have severe mood swings through out a 24 hour span. I was never depressed for weeks or months. I started my mornings out really down and ended my nights with high spirits. And_ the cycle repeated itself all over again the next day. Also_ I lost my keys everyday because I couldn't focus. My bills never got paid on time. I racked up a lot of debt. I had trust issues and was very suspicious_ but extremely intuitive. I was also very creative. Lamictal takes the bad away_ but the good too. No more losing my keys or paying my bills late. But_ my intuition is gone_ as well as my creativeness and many memories. I'm happy that I'm on this drug because I feel balanced. But_ I'm concerned because I don't know how much longer my body will tolerate it. I have a prescription for another blood test. So_ far I've been good for 4 years. Hopefully_ this one will turns good as well. I hope those of you who are not having such a good experience find the right treatment. I also take Seroquel for my ADHD. I've lost weight on that.

I have to say the first day I took it I noticed a huge shift. I wondered if it was just in my head but I am still totally level headed_ my paranoid obsessive thoughts are gone. I feel like myself completely just calm and at peace. I have been reading for days researching this medication. I know everyone is very different but I have to say I am terrified (in a calm way lol) about potential health risks. My mental state has never been debilitating. I am highly functional and extremely driven. But I am very sensitive and if I am under stress or unable to sleep well_ work out_ and or keep a perfect diet... I begin to be reactive and emotional to the point of confusion. I haven't always been this way but get like this sometimes. On this drug I don't want to drink because it makes me feel sick.

I am meeting with my doctor in a few days to further discuss the risks. The scary thing about this drug is it can really mess up your liver_ kidneys_ brain...At least people have had these experiences and that scared me.

Other than that there have been virtually no side effects. I have gained 5 pounds since starting Lamictal. But I am confident that is as a result of being less depressed and not a direct side effect of the medicine.,For me this has been a God send. I was initially diagnosed with Major Depression (over 10 years ago) and was subsequently put on a variety of Anti depressants. This served to fuel my manic states. My marriage and finances were on the line so I sought out the best Christian Psychiatrist in my area and was correctly diagnosed with Bipolar II. He immediately prescribed Lamictal and we are now moving forward in our journey to find the right combination of medicines to give me the best quality of life possible. I have only taken Lamictal for 5 weeks but am amazed at the results thus far and am confident that it will continue to be the mainstay of my medicine regiment. If you are battling Bipolar II I highly recommend you consider Lamictal. Best of luck to you as you work to find healing.  God Bless,M,38,5  weeks200mg 1X D,2/9/2011Email,Lamictal

Now I have to always wear glasses to read or I can't see anything.,While I can say that I feel that it has helped my mood and the up's and down's I used to experience_ the last couple months the memory loss and the vision has become a big problem for me.

I would like to reduce the dose slowly and try to live without it_ but I am also scared_ as many of the people that wrote here_ that it might bring me back to my previous mood changes.  I have a mild cyclotimia_ but nothing had worked before I took Lamictal. Prozac really made me ill and fluvoxamine didn't do much... I also took Vandral which didn't work either.Until I read the comments here (and I have read many) I hadn't realised I had as many side effects as I do. I would really appreciate if anyone could write to share anything about body odour as a side effect.

331, 3, Bipolar,I've noticed most medication prescribed for bipolar to have the same 'basic' side-effects_ which_ for me_ includes: dizziness when standing up_ followed by blurred vision & ringing in the ears -I usually just sit/lie down on the spot and it goes away- to avoid fainting. Stiff muscles_ especially in my legs when e.g. climbing stairs_ stiff neck_ frequent headaches (usual I don't require pain pills)_ heart palpitations & hot flushes (usually at night). After adding Lamictal to my pill cocktail (Concerta; Edronax; Seroquel; Serlife & Diane) I haven't noticed much change in my usual side-effects (permanent) -however_ increased night sweats (wake up soaked) & still the occasional moodswing (from neutral to crying in a matter of seconds -this usually occurred late afternoon_ so I decided to take my night dose of Lamictam earlier -this works for me) -note_I find all these side effects to be minor in the long run_ although you need to adapt your lifestyle somewhat_ these sy,My weight has remained constant -I lost my appetite once I started bipolar medication 2 years ago (originally lost 14kg's less than two months)_ so I haven't experienced Lamictal to affect weight.Lamictal related: I've become increasingly anti-social and rarely leave the house_ however_ being 21 years old_ I guess this keeps me out of trouble. Positive: I've become increasingly interested in and focussed when studying_ it seems I've gained some drive and determination. As for fatique_ I've always been tired_ and my dreams have always been vivid. All in all_ I honestly don't know whether or not Lamictal has influenced me_ either positively_ or negatively. I noticed that my skin scars easily which sucks_ and have to avoid picking(have always had problem skin)and shave extra carefully. Even scratching a mosquito bite leaves a scar. I have recently been developing a rather odd symtom_ which is most probably Lamictal-related_ so it's off to the doctor tomorrow -started as a stinging-feeling in my feet if I walk on uneven surfaces (most noticeable on rough carpet) has become worse_ almost permanent_ increasingly painful tingling (like pins and needles) in both feet_ as well as bumps (feels like the swollen lymph nodes in your neck) appearing on my feet. I'm hoping it's nothing serious_ since stopping Lamictal_ from experience_ physically makes you so sick that you feel like you're dying a slow_ painful death.

Maybe some fatigue_ but I have been tired my whole life.,"I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 48_ after years of being misdiagnosed by tons of shrinks with ""just"" depression. The diagnosis was discovered when I was put on Wellbutrin during a severe depression. Without a mood stabilizer in place the Wellbutrin put me into a severe manic episode in which I was having both auditory and visual hallucinations and racing thoughts so powerful that I could not sleep- making it even worse. I agreed to take lamictal as my last resort to killing myself because with the other meds I tried I felt so drugged and zombie-like.Thank God I did not let the ""deadly rash"" scare me away from this drug! All I had for side effects were moderate headaches for 2-3 days every time the dosage was upped. NO OTHER SIDE EFFECTS! I stayed at 250 mgs for a long time. Then in Dec. 2010 I had breakthrough mania and mixed episodes  with ultra-rapid cycling. All caused by being place on a beta-blocker for high blood pressure that gave me insomnia and anxiety so bad I hardly slept for 3 weeks. No sleep is a disaster for bipolars! So I just got upped today to 300 mgs (Jan. 2011). I will write later to say how the 300 mgs is working to control this terrible disorder that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.

It initially made a pretty good impact_ but the nausea was an ongoing problem each time the dose was adjusted_ and sometimes would correct itself once the dose was reduced and then returned to a higher level. Three months in marked the first time I'd felt 'normal' my entire life_ which lasted for 2 1/2 months and then slowly lost ground from there_ month by month. Unfortunately my body becomes addicted to products very quickly so it's hard to maintain a good state for more than a short period of time so I'm not blaming the Lamictal - rather thanking it for giving me a couple of sane months! The nausea_ though_ was no joke for me. It was often severe_ and given that I've never been prone to nausea or heartburn it was quite striking that I ended up with a bottle of Mylanta at my bedside_ two in my medicine cabinet and two at work - at all times.

After being depressed/anxious forever I use to have problems getting to sleep and then have problems waking up.  Now with Lamictal and Ambien I go to sleep immediately and wake up approximately 3-4 hours later every night.  I think that is driving me more crazy than any of my actual crazy.  Sex drive is down a little bit_ but it use to be very high.  I just got taken off Paxiva.  Couldn't have an orgasm with it and I think that was adding to my anxiety a little bit.  I do_ however_ think my wife enjoyed it until she realized it was bothering me a lot.  I can't remember anything.  Names_ words_ memories_ they pretty much escape me.  I have the same conversations with the same people multiple times.  Most people just humor me and let me tell them again.  Its really getting embarrassing.  Almost to the point that I don't even want to talk to anyway_ fearing I may have already talked to them about it.  The dizziness_ pin/needles_ and brain flashes aren't really that fun either.  I get these really odd flashes when I move my eyes or head sometimes.  Almost like someone just took a picture in my eyes.  That is usually followed by some weird 110 volt electricity running from my head to my fingertips.  I've never fainted in my life_ but I have almost fainted twice since taking this.

The nausea continued for the rest of the day. In the 5th week_ I couldn't get out of bed because of the pain. I felt like my spine was on fire and jabbing into the back of my skull. My shoulders were so tight that I lost sensation and motor skills in my dominate arm.

After a slight response on 25mgs and a really promising response on 50mgs_ I have yet to regain the initial benefit. Though my moods are okay_ I still have a good deal of dissociation. Given my history with medication perhaps I'll need to go higher (possibly up to 400mgs or even higher)or add an SSRI as I've heard the combination can be quite effective. My doctor wants to wait another couple of weeks before deciding to up the dose or try something else.  I would really rather not have to go back on SSRI due to possible weight gain and sexual side effects.

Other side effects I have experienced from the beginning are massive hair loss and slight dizziness upon standing.,Any other side effects experienced for the first year have completely disappeared.

The feeling dumb as a rock and not being able to remember anything or finish a sentence lasted about 6 months. The drug saved my life_ literally_ but the head movements and ear ringing really have me worried_ wondering if it will get worse.

This went on for about a week or two. As I titrated up on it- from 25 mgs. to 200 mgs.- each time I would have a bad headache (the famous ""lamictal headache"")that lasted from 2-3 days and then went away. Each and every time I upped my dosage I had this headache_ but ONLY for 2-3 days. Other than that- ZERO side effects-only benefits. I did not gain any weight and I do not feel as if I am taking a drug at all. I love it!",I am bipolar- undiagnosed until I was 48. I am 53 now. I tried a variety of meds_ but had bad side effects on all of them. Then I was put on lamictal. I was afraid_ because of the rash thing_ which I obviously did not get.

I am so happy I said yes to this drug! I have never had a deathly deep depression since I was put on it_ nor have I gone off the charts manic. In truthfullness_ I did start drinking heavily after my diagnosis because I could not believe I had a real mental illness. Even with my heavy drinking_ the lamictal kept working. But because I was drinking_ it did not work as well as it could have until I finally quit drinking in February 2010 and went to AA. I felt great for the 2 months I was sober_ and then sunk into a depression- which I found out later is very common when you quit drinking. I was put on Wellbutrin 150mgs to combat this depression. At that amount_ I felt better- but not 100%. I ended up having quite a few slips with the booze_ until I finally decided- just recently- that if I am ever to have a chance at feeling close to 100%- I can never drink again.

389, 4, Major Depression / Bipolar II,Some loss of short-term memory.The the generic manufactured by Cadista (white round pill) was horrible.,I was taking the brandname 200mg Lamictal and it was working very well for me_ after about a year the pharmacy switched me to the generic made by Teva (it was a blue diamond shape). I had no noticeable difference with the Teva generic.  About 6 months later the pharmacy switched to a different generic manufacturer_ Cadista (It is round white with the imprint 'J 248' on it).  After about a week I noticed a huge drop in mood and was feeling very depressed and emotional out of nowhere.  Initially I hadn't made the connection that my problem started happening right after I switched to the Cadista generic.  Then I switched to the brandname Lamictal and the problem went away.  Insurance wouldn't pay for the brandname_ so I had to pay a huge amount out of pocket.  A few months later I asked my doctor to prescribe me brandname 'XR' version.  Since there isn't a generic of the 'XR' version_ my insurance pays a higher percentage than they will for the original immediate release Lamictal brandname (since there is a generic for the immediate release).  This makes it much cheaper than the immediate release brandname Lamictal.  For me it's worth paying more for the brandname and not having to worry about the pharmacy switching between generic manufacturers whenever they want.  I hope my 'XR' tip for insurance coverage will be helpful to someone.  It turns out I think the XR version is better for me anyway.,M,30,2  years200 MG 1X D,8/18/2010Email,Lamictal

Both have not happened after about a month of increasing dosage to 200mg a day.I was able to remedy the acne that with LOTS of water (68-70oz a day) and Mary Kay Blemish Toner and Mary Kay Acne Treatment Gel. No Hair thinning. ,THIS DRUG HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. Before taking Lamotrigine I took Wellbutrin 300XL mg 1x a day for about 4 years.  I was still weepy and obsessed over negative thoughts_ I just thought this was the way I was inherently and could never change.  I needed to go to a new MD because of insurance and he diagnosed me as having cyclical personality disorder and the mildest form of Bi-Polar disorder.  This drug has helped me tremendously and would try anything to KEEP taking it. I haven't cried since taking it; find it a bit easier to let things go.  The only negative I experienced I had is the cystic acne_ but seems to subside over time_ drinking LOTS of water and changing my skin regiment.  I have always had beautiful skin without any effort_ so the acne really bothered me. But this pill has done such wonders for me that I didn't want to abandon it_ especially since it has not affected my weight. When I first started using the Mary Kay products I used the toner 3x a day and applied the acne gel after. I was able to get rid of a blemish after only 2 days of using the Mary Kay. I do not sell Mary Kay_ I am only giving this information for those who might have the same experience.  ,F,38,3  months200 1X D,7/10/2010Email,Lamictal

The shrink put me on Celexa and Seroquel. The Seroquel began to help immediately_ but the Celexa took a few weeks to kick in. The Celexa helped with the depression for a few months_ but I still had manic episodes and pretty bad mood swings. Eventually it stopped working all together causing panic attacks. After I started having psychotic episodes_ my shrink switched me to Lamictal. The FIRST DAY I started noticing the difference. I was calmer and happier. After a few weeks_ the mood swings had gone from 7-15 a day to once or twice every few days. The panic attacks tapered off_ and my nightmares tapered off. Lamictal did decrease my sex drive_ but I saw it as more of a blessing. Since I began taking Lamictal_ I now have a NORMAL healthy sex drive.

I'm making a promise to update this post every two weeks for the next two months_ and then periodically after that if I'm still on it. If I start to feel positive effects_ I'll update sooner! Fingers crossed_ I feel like this is my last resort. I'm glad it's prescribed for treatment resistant depression_ because if it was just another anti-d_ I would have little hope.

445, 2, Bipolar,I've taken Lamictal for 9 yrs and have experienced: weight gain (50 pounds)_ memory loss_ sleeplessness_ anxiety_ phobias_ and continued depression. Why do doctors think it's better to give up mania but they don't care about depression_ weight gain and memory loss? I never miss taking my meds - however_ I'm demanding they change me to something else. I have tried combinations including: Cymbalta_ Effexor_ Abilify_ Depokote_ Wellbutrin and a ton of others I can't remember or spell! Again_ no memory!,I've been taking Lamical for 9 years and over the past three years things have started to go bad - especially my memory. Can't remember names or how to spell simple words. Big loss in concentration. I feel like I'm floating and at times I feel a heaviness to my body. WEIGHT GAIN! I've gained over 50 pounds since I started taking Lamictal. If that doesn't make a person depressed_ nothing will. BTW_ 200 mg of Selenium for 3 weeks will stop hair loss. 1000/2000 mg of Omega 3 will stop dry eye and dry skin (won't hurt you_ check it out). Now I'm becoming phobic. At times I'm afraid to drive_ look in mirrors and leave my house. In case you're wondering_ my shrink doesn't think this is bad enough to take me off or change meds. I have a hard time falling asleep and when I do I sleep only a few hours and have very vivid dreams. I've taken 10 to 20 mg of Ambien every night for 10 years (doctor ordered)! So_ here's my suggestion: For a week or two_ keep a journal of your habits_ thoughts_ mood_ memory loss - times of day you experience these - whatever you want to measure_ read over it every now and then to see if you're getting better or worse. Use it as your own gage to your mental health and talk with your doctor_ family and friends to see if they are seeing the same behavior. Without a journal it'll be difficult to remember what you want to talk with your doctor about. Doing this has helped me build a case to stop taking Lamictal and become an active participant in my care.,F,49,9  years400 mg 2X D,4/16/2010Email,Lamictal

Other than that no noticeable physical side effects.,The first time I was given Lamictal in hospital it seemed to be very effective almost immediately I was stable and functionning well for over a year ( except since that time I started to smoke like a chimney_ I was a little smoker previously)  then came stressful events and I went down very quickly_ suicidal I stopped everything except Seroquel 100mg at night_ I got better without medicine against my doctor's advice. Then nine months ago_ I was very panicky and fearful_ again i was prescribed Lamictal 150mg and I picked up a bit (with Seroquel and Pristic) now I am low again I have been increased to 200mg and 400mg Seroquel 100mg Pristic; I have anxiety_ I am self centered and preoccupied_ I am now trying to convince myself that I always had a personality disorder I also gained 10 pounds( maybe Seroquel)_ I want to be lethargic all day and forget the things I need to do_ just want to read and watch late night movies_ almost scared to venture in the fresh air. I have been treated since 21 years and have been on many things so many I can't recall them including Lithium for a long time. I have almost lost faith in psychiatric drugs_ I believe now that they become ineffective after a while (up to a year)_ then they get lost in the washing cycle of the brain. Naturally I am only speaking for myself_ perhaps what I experience is another experience of normality only very twisted as some vegetals in nature can be and this is not a illness.,F,53,9  months100MG 2X D,4/8/2010Email,Lamictal
448, 4, Bipolar II,initially extreme nausea_ lost 10 pounds in two weeks. lately i've been very hungry. Also was put on zoloft_ so I'm not sure. But weight gain is seriously concerning me. I've gained 3 pounds in 2 days. Usually tired.,WAY less mood swings. But when I do get mad_ far more violent_ yet not as long. Sometimes I feel like a zombie.

I felt very dumb compared to my old self. Would get hiper sometimes out of nowhere. Got a new pimple every day and never before this had I experienced acne. You cannot drink on this drug and it is very expensive if you don't have insurance. Cons outweigh benefits.,F,26,11  months300 MG 1X D,4/6/2010,Lamictal
450, 4, Ultradian Cycling Bipolar,The decrease in sex drive (i.e. no sex drive at all) is one of the worst side effects I have experienced. I have to take Levitra (40mg to 60mg) just to hold an erection for any amount of time. I am also borderline DPD (Dissociative Personality Disorder) with anti social (sociopathic) tenancies_ PTSD_ and low grade Schizophrenia. I have to take 400mg to 600mg of Seroquel (an atypical anti psychotic) a night just to keep myself functioning.I don't know if I am experiencing hair loss because I have been slowly loosing my hair since I was 16. I randomly break out in extremely dry skin (especially on my face and scalp)_ and I have outbreaks of red spots all over my torso almost monthly. That lasts for a few days_ but there hasn't been any negative effects from that. It also has caused me insomnia.,Over all_ this medication has saved my life. My Mood cycles cycle extremely (and I do mean extremely) fast. I documented 52 Major mood shifts in a 10 hour period before I started taking this medication. I still cycle_ but it has slowed down a lot. I now only cycle once or twice a week now. Randomly I do start cycling fast again_ but those only last a few days to a week at most_ and these episodes only happen once or twice every 2 months. I continue to document my mood swings_ hallucinations_ and flash backs (PTSD) almost religiously as to help with my ongoing therapy.I was deployed to Iraq for 16 months_ and again to Afghanistan for 12 months while I was in the Army. My symptoms started worsening during and after both deployments. My combat experience was extensive_ and I continue to cope with a lot of what I saw/did. The Lamictal also helped a lot with my nightmares and flashbacks.All in all_ this medication saved me from suicide and from violence in the civilian world. The pros have outweighed the cons and I like this medication.,M,24,3  years400mg 1X D,4/2/2010Email,Lamictal
451, 5, Trigeminal Neuralgia,None.,This drug has saved my life. I have literally tried dozens of different medications for horrific nerve pain in the face (trigeminal neuralgia) due to a brain tumor and this is the only one that has worked so well with NO side effects. I was so scared to start taking it because of the possibility of a rash_ but I'm glad I gave it a chance. I titrated on to it VERY slowly starting at 12.5 MG and now after 3 months I am up to 100 MG which is working well so I plan to stay at that dose unless I need to increase it. I was also scared of hair loss and acne_ neither of which I've gotten. In fact_ I had a slight hormonal acne problem before lamictal which ironically has completely cleared up since taking the lamictal! Maybe a coincidence but who knows. I'm am just so grateful that it is working for my pain.,F,25,3  months50 2X D,3/31/2010,Lamictal
452, 3, Bipolar II/Rapid Cycling,	Serious difficulty focusing my eyes when reading or typing. Im in grad school and enjoy reading but the constant struggle to see made reading miserable. Drug worked well to soften the depressive parts of the cycle and it took the edge off of the manic peaks_ but did nothing for reduce anxiety. I was tense ALL the time and had difficulty falling asleep. Usually I can get up and out the door quickly but since taking the drug getting out of bed in the morning is EXTREMELY difficult. My body just doesnt cooperate the first time around.,	Worst side-effect is WEIGHT GAIN. I am very active_ work-out 4-5 times a week and eat a super healthy diet. I never had trouble managing weight before so when my weight started to creep up as soon as I got on the drug I was worried. Ironically I had a lot more energy to exercise_ but despite an even more rigorous routine I still couldnt lose a single pound_ no matter what I did. Before if I gain a little weight over the holidays I was always able to easily shed it in a few weeks. Since September 2009 I gained 13pounds! Im off the drug now and looking for other alternatives. Overall I was happy with this med_ but constant weight gain is a deal breaker for me.,F,26,6  months100 1X D,3/31/2010,Lamictal

I'm 37 and have struggled for almost a decade to try and find the right combination of meds for me.... what I am on now has been a LIFESAVER!

461, 4, Bi Polar II disorder/ Anxiety,short term memory loss_ inability to focus for long periods of time_ concentration problems_ forgetting words mid-sentence. Overall_ forgetfulness_ easy bruising.,I self-diagnosed myself as BP II a few years ago and after taking cymbalta (made me want to kill myself) and then Wellbutrin_ I quit meds entirely. However_ following that came the destruction of several relationships_ out of control spending_ and intense periods of irritablity where I would flip out over absolutely NOTHING_ I realized I needed help. I went to my Dr. and he put me back on Wellbutrin - mistake_ I quit smoking but my rapid cycling went out of control. I was up and down_ up and down... sometimes every few minutes. After doing this for about 5 months - I went back and told him what was going on. He explained that with BP people_ Wellbutrin (300mg daily) often makes them cycle even faster. He gave me Lamictal (because I demanded I be put on something that did not make me gain ANY weight) and Klonopins (1mg a day) for my anxiety and OCD thoughts. At first I didn't notice much of a difference but now my life is completely different. I didn't realize how miserable I was before! My mood swings are very rare now. The only concern my doctor had was the fact that in 2 weeks I lost 15 pounds - all 3 of these drugs decreased my desire to eat and I'm basically living on salad and hard boiled eggs (WTF?!) A month later and I'm down about 18 pounds and I feel great. I'm 5'2 and went from 140 to 122. I''m also having bad bruising and I'm being tested to make sure Lamictal isn't supressing my blood platelets.

469, 5, Seizures,Uncoordinated_ sleepiness_ dizziness & headaches. Mostly uncoordinated & my short term memory is horrible.,My seizures/stiffness were only at night. I took a few other anti-seizure medicines in 1997-2002 that never cured my seizures. Ever since I've been on 150mg a day on lamictal I have had none. I only had 4 seizures in my life (starting 1997) from a brain contusion in 1990. Lamictal does help_ my side affects are dizziness_ short term memory problem (But I think everyone has that-lol) sleepiness and hair loss. I notice if I get too tired and stressed my dizziness gets worse. My Dr. decided last month he doesn't trust generic drug makers anymore and put me on the name brand 200 mg a day. Well_ for that whole week I swear_ I was dizziness everyday. So bad_ I would cry before I went to bed. It was like I was spinning all day. And_ I rolled my eyes in back of my head everyday. I thought it was from the dizziness. Then on the 7th day on the 200 mg I looked online searching what the rolling of the eyes mean. I was having an absence seizure all the time.  Called the after hour Dr. and he put me back on the generic 150 mg a day (75mg a.m. & 75mg p.m.) So_ the drug works from eliminating my seizures_ but I need a smaller dose. Remember_ everyone is different on side effects.,F,34,7  years150mg 1X D,2/9/2010,Lamictal

I'm still dizzy a month later_ and was diagnosed today with vestibular neuritis.  It's constant_ noticeable at any movement of my head.  They said I probably had BPPV caused by that.

A week ago had severe breast tenderness.  It scared me.  I've never had that before.  I know I don't have any STDs (not possible).  First 6 months were great.

Went untreated for yrs and managed it with other substances. Was very hesitant about taking this because it felt like I was admitting something was ""wrong"" with me. Once I started_ what a difference! Started on 100mg -initially it really curbed very severe mood swings_ agitation_ anxiety_ and irritability. I would seriously want to choke someone for spilled water and this has helped tremendously. Don't think I had many side effects but it is difficult to tell b/c was on soma 250mg_ and currently take flexiril 5-10mg_ vicodin 500/5mg as needed for car accident. Hence the Lamictal. Dr said I should stop taking soma b/c it caused headaches (which I had) and the Lamictal would help w/that. I felt great_ felt more like my old self and happier. After a month_ bipolar and depression cycles not as frequent_ less severe but still there. Was still really snappy and irritable w/crying episodes. Currently titrating up to 200mg of Lamictal and am on 150mg right now. Also take Seroquel at night_ after Ambien 10mg stopped working_ and that has helped me so much. Feel less anxiety and feel much happier! I am joking and laughing again_ more carefree_ and just feel amazing.

I spent years struggling to keep my life from falling apart while feeling awful and waiting for the all-too-short periods when my moods were okay. And now ""okay"" is the norm.

I found it to be very mentally balancing_ no depression or mania at 300 mg.  However_ I am tired of not having enough energy_ and have reached a new spiritual level_ so I have been tapering off.  I am down to 150 mg_ but won't go lower for a long time_ as I have noticed a resurgence in depression.

After years on 100mg I am generally used to the side effects_ some days I feel none. My excersie regimen helps (I am an avid distance runner) with the lethargy. I can function and I would say that it makes me a more effective person. If I forgert to take it boy you feel it. Makes me feel like I am made of rubber.,M,40,5  years,12/17/2009,Lamictal
487, 2, depression/ slight bipolar,Memory loss_ weight gain_ no longer as anxious but more depressed_ constant fatigue_ muscle aches_ feelings of anger,I am currently weening myself off of this drug VERY safely and gradual.  Mainly because I don't feel as though the pros outweigh the cons. Weight gain and memory loss are two deal breakers for me. I have gained 15 lbs in the past year.  I can't remember ANYTHING to the point of embarrassment.  People think I dont listen or am drunk because I literally cannot remember yesterday. And this is only fueled by my depression and excessive sleeping. I no longer feel a constant sense of dread and guilt (i.e. anxiety) however_ that feeling has been replaced with depression_ complicity and isolation.  My perpetually sore muscles also make moan and groan like an old woman!  I am also immensely anger all the time for no particular reason.,F,24,1  years,12/17/2009,Lamictal
488, 4, anxiety_ depression,The following side effects were experienced when starting the medication. They went away as I adjusted to the medication: Blurred Vision_ Itching_ slight water retention_ tired feeling just after taking med.,After living with anxiety for several years_ I developed a bad case of depression last year. I tried just about every SSRI and could not adjust. The initial side effects were impossible. I tried Zyprexa and it helped however it caused major weight gain (30 lbs) I was then placed on Lyrica and that worked except I developed a painful pimple type rash over a period of a month. Lyrica also caused weight gain. Even with daily cardio and healthy eating I still put on weight. I started Lamictal and I was able to adjust to the med very easy compared to all of the other meds. The worst side effects which went away as I tapered up was itching_ blurred vision_ tired feeling and slight water retention in face. I was concerened about the rash everyone talks about and was almost paranoid whenever I saw the slightest red bump or pimple. These went away quickly unlike the reaction from Lyrica which took months.My overall opinion is Lamictal is that if you stay with it for a month or so and put up with the temporary side effects_ it will prove to be an excellent med. My severe depression has lifted and I am able to function after a year of hell trying just about every medication available.,M,45,9  months,12/14/2009,Lamictal

I was willing to give it a bit longer but my pdoc said if I had this many side effects after 2 weeks_ we should try something else. It made it hard for me to concentrate when reading_ I couldn't think of the right word_ I was spacier. I didn't like that at all.

493, 5, Bipolar,In the first month of taking this medication I experienced even more mood swings than before_ which i never thought to be possible_ and the swings were more severe.  This went away after the first month/month and a half.  I was at the doctor's office recently and they noted a 20lb weight gain in 2 years.  My first year taking it I did not experience a great amount of weight gain_ only about 5lbs.  In the past year or so_ I have experienced hair loss_ and I still am now.  When I first began taking Lamictal I was feeling more anxious and paranoid than I had been in the past_ but like my other side effects_ these side effects subsided.,I am very pleased with my results from taking Lamictal.  I am taking 300mg a day-150 in the morning and 150 at night.  I had suffered from bipolar from the age of about 12_ but it was thought to be hormones.  When I was diagnosed bipolar and began taking this medication at 15 years old_ my life turned around.  Grades started improving greatly_ I got into a great college and program_ my social life improved_ my relationship with my family went back to the way it was_ I stopped snapping at every little thing_ etc.  Before Lamictal_ I would literally have 8-11 severe mood swings an hour.  I was even at the point of attempting suicide three times and just hated life in general.  After starting Lamictal_ these swings have stopped.  I am living a happy life which I am very grateful for.  If I miss either my morning or night dose_ I have these swings again_ but they are not as severe or often (goes down to about 2-4 swings an hour).  Lamictal is a life changer and I would recommend this drug to anyone in a heartbeat.  You just have to make it past the first month or two and be willing to deal with the side effects_ because other than that_ this drug is amazing.,F,18,3.5  years,12/8/2009,Lamictal

500, 3, Grand Mal Seizure,August 2009 while in the ER due to a 4 to 5 minute seizure (1st ever) my husband was given the loaded dose of Dilantin (in addition to morphine and Ativan). We saw our Neuro a few days after discharged from Hosp and she gave us a schedule to taper off Dilantin and start Lamictal XR 50mg and increase over 5 weeks to mtce dosage of 200mg. He's been taking 200mg of Lamictal for about 3 months now; some hair loss_ dry scalp_ has had several styes in one eye_ more significant hand tremor (which was much less pronounced prior to Lamictal). His appetite did seem to increase initially_ but he did not gain any weight. He's had cognitive decline for almost 6 years so not sure if Lamictal is adversely affecting memory. I don't like the fact he may have to be on anti-seizure medication forever_ but don't want him to experience another seizure either.,,M,65,3  months,11/29/2009Email,Lamictal

I get headaches_ which the doctors say are normal and have nothing to do with my brain tumor_ and I am recently experiencing increased_ but tolerable chest pain. Everyone is different_ so don't take this to mean that these are the side effects you will have_ but if you do_ consult your physician; it may be nothing to worry about.,I've been taking Lamictal for about 5 months.,F,22, ,11/27/2009Email,Lamictal

Pulse wakes me up_ can feel it pounding through my entire body or at least my torso and neck. I also experienced more chest pains than usual for much longer_ that would also wake me up in my sleep.

I've developed the ability to be cheerful. I no longer expect the worst. I have a little more motivation than I used to_ and I'm comfortable trying new activities and being around people I don't know. My relationship has improved a great deal. Side effects: I gained about 18% of my body weight_ after weighing the same for 25 years. I hate it. But I have cleavage for the first time in my life_ so there's the silver lining. The headaches were awful for a while_ but they have greatly improved. The insomnia can persist for weeks sometimes_ but then it will go away for a while. I already had age-related far-sightedness developing_ but it seemed to get a little worse overnight. When hiking or bouldering I've found I don't have the balance I used to_ and I can get a little vertigo sometimes. And I'm definitely clumsy now - motor coordination not so good.

Finally_ my speech and grammar get messed up- especially with tenses. It's all really embarrassing for me because I'm an outstanding student at an ivy league school and the side effects are changing how I view myself.,I'm on 50mg_ and the side effects I mentioned are only getting worse as the dose increases. What's ironic is that I don't care about the side effects as much as I should because I see how well its working for me. My mood is better than ever. I was terrified of this drug before I started taking it. If the side effects weren't ruining my grades and relationships I'd go so far as to call it a miracle drug.,F,20,1  months,10/18/2009,Lamictal

I keep having thoughts about the world ending and nothing matters because we are all doomed to die anyway. When I have these thougts I am absolutely certain it is the truth and that I (and everyone else) is just wasting time living. I have to fight to get that thought out of my head. I am also waking up knowing I have to do a certain task_ like look up something on the internet or call someone. I am most certain that it has to be done at that moment. It makes perfect sense to me at the time. I don't do it because there is still a part of my brain that stops me. I have been on Trileptal for years but my circle thoughts were coming back and it was causing me to lose my concentration. My psychiatrist put me on this (100mgs sid) to help-thinking it might get rid of depression and thus help me focus (can't take adderall for too long-screws me up big time) but it hasn't helped at all. I can't wait to be finished with it. I'll take my lack of concentration and rapid thoughts over this any day. It actually seems to make them worse!

I was placed on Lamictal in March_ after losing my Mom to pancreatic cancer_ losing my job_ and getting divorce all within a matter of about 9 months.  It has been increased several times.  From 25mg morning and night_ to 25mg morning and 50 night_ and now 50 morning and 50 night.  I noticed about two months ago (when it was last increased) that I was shedding A LOT! I now have a very noticable bald spot that I am having a hard time covering no matter how I style it.  I am a 28 year old female with red hair...this is part of my physical identity!  I think this could be the cause.  I originally thought it may be post super stress reaction or caused by hormone levels being out of wack due to PCOS but my obgyn doens't think it's the PCOS.  Just hope it's something that can be fixed and that my hair can grow back!,The lamictal greatly helped my mood_ but for me_ if it is causing my hair loss_ I would rather be on something else and keep my hair.

I did some research and found that anticonvulsants block absorption of certain minerals and vitamins including folate and others. If you are missing folate it affects your hair (that's why pregnant women are encouraged to take it during pregnancy to avoid this). I wish my doctor had told me ""hey_ take a multivitamin with selenium and zinc and biotin"" because this could have possibly been avoided.

I eventually stopped going to class and at one period I didn't shower or brush my teeth for 3 days in a row. That's when I knew I needed help so I withdrew from school (Nov). I went to a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with BPII. I was put on lamictal_ along with the antidepressants. I worked my way up to 100mg of lamictal. I noticed by the 2nd week I started feeling better. However_ my anxiety was REALLY bad still. He put me on 0.5mg of klonopin (up to 3 times a day). I felt relaxed but was VERY sleepy. Then it took a turn and I began to get restless_ and my mind wouldn't shut up to let me fall asleep. My psych put me on 25mg of seroquel to help me sleep. That definitely worked. THEN_ my life took another turn junior year. My boyfriend broke up with me and I was devastated. He bumped me up to 200mg of lamictal.

It's claimed to be more effective against depressive episodes than more regularly prescribed BPD meds like Lithium_ and it was. However_ I gradually developed back pain during the slow dose increase used to start this medication. It started as a slight stiffness in my back_ and I assumed I was just out of shape. Then it became painful_ and I assumed I had hurt my back somehow_ but didn't think the Lamictal had anything to do with it. By the time I got to 200mg_ I was basically crippled and wondered each time I bent over whether that would be the time I wouldn't be able to stand back up- at 37 and fairly healthy_ I knew something was wrong. In spite of pointing this out to various doctors and nurses_ none of them seemed to make the connection_ and it wasn't until I did my own research that I found that a VERY HIGH NUMBER of people have similar complaints_ something like 1 in 12. At 200mg I had my blood checked_ which revealed abnormal liver functioning_ and high triglycerides and cholesterol. The doctors (all psych trained) didn't find that odd either. I have stopped taking the med and hope that sometime in the next month or so my back will recover and that the damage isn't permanent.

I had to cut down on my Celexa dose once I reached 100mgs of Lamictal because 20mgs of Celexa kicked me into a full blown manic phase. The day I upped to 100mgs of Lamictal_ I took my dose of Celexa and had the first full manic episode I'd had in months. But_ cutting back on the Celexa was a necessary part of the process anyway.

I couldn't feel properly happy or sad or angry or anything. It zapped my creativity and made me not want to do anything. It allowed me to lose weight too quickly because it suppressed hunger so severely. I didn't realize I was basically in starvation mode and robbing my body of nutrients. I had to pee constantly and my parents spent a lot of money on tests to see what was causing this after my doctor said Lamictal couldn't be the culprit. This IS IN FACT a side effect of Lamictal - a quick Google search shows this. My doctor also denies that my devastating hair loss is a result of this medication and insists it is purely the weight loss. I am quitting it completely despite their wishes. I am an 18 yr old girl with long amazingly red hair which I love and is a big part of me. I have received compliments on it every day of my life. I've lost maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of it in the last 2 months. Nothing has ever caused me so much anxiety and depression as this...this med is NOT worth it. IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HAIR_ STAY AWAY FROM LAMICTAL. If you must take it_ don't let yourself lose weight too fast. You'll have to eat when you don't feel like it. Thankfully I had thick hair to begin with_ but now I'm doing everything I can to save it - Maxi Hair supplements_ a really healthy high protein diet_ Head and Shoulders Shampoo_ putting olive oil in my hair every other night_ and of course quitting this medication.,F,18,5  months,8/7/2009Email,Lamictal

Night sweats_ more thirst--minimum 5 liters of water a day_ but these aren't important_ it is the intense edginess and extreme internal unrest that is so terrible_ and the illogical and yet apparently uncontrollable way in which I take things out on my poor husband that worries me_ if I can stick with it or not. Some insomnia_ difficulty getting 7 hours per night where I used to need 9 minimum...,Depokate was doing a great job of controlling my epilepsy with minimal side effects_ just a bit of flatlining of my personality and sloooowed metabolism.  But with planning for a family_ the decision to switch was made.  I'm not even up to full dose yet and I am just hoping my body will become accustomed to the drug and this awful intense nervous energy/irritability/internal unrest will stop.  Like my blood is on fire_ all my nerves on hypersensitive gaurd.  If it continues I'm just going to have to go back to Depakote...this is intolerable.,F,34,2.5  months,8/2/2009,Lamictal

This illness _ the emotional pain_ is so debilitating.  I am trying to find the right ""cocktail""_ so that I could make it the next few hours_ while others live their life....weeks_ and months at a time....

577, 4, Bipolar I,Anything over 200 mgs causes serious cognitive side effects for me. Higher analytical powers are intact but short term memory and basic common sense and comprehension go down the drain.,Excellent for me as a mood stabilizer. The best one. I give it a four- and not a five-star rating because over 200mgs daily caused me such cognitive distress that I failed a very important exam and lost a job partly because of it. I am still picking up the pieces. My psych. wouldn't believe me when I reported this side effect at 400 mgs/day. It is rare_ but there. MORAL OF THE STORY: NEVER second-guess your own feelings about how your body is reacting to a drug simply because your doctor says a given side effect doesn't usually happen.

This was a hellish drug for me. I felt like I was on LSD. I saw things_ I literally thought I had lost my mind. I became afraid to answer the phone from the anxiety it gave me. I felt like I was in some type of fugue state. I eventually went to the emergency room where they kept me overnight for allergic reactions. Later that week_ I overdosed and was hospitalized for 8 days. Not fun.,M,30,1  times,5/10/2009,Lamictal

I haven't really noticed weight gain as my weight naturally fluctuates 4lbs. I'm currently on 25 mg twice a day and will be upping it to 25mg 3 times a day. The frequent urination just started so i'm not sure if it's linked to the lamictal. I also started having a few days where I just don't feel right and I can't give a real reason why.

608, 5, Bipolar NOS,insomnia and very mild acne,My daughter (10) has been on Lamictal for just over a month.  We have definitely noticed improvement in her moods and ability to cope with change and stress.  She began at the 25mg dose_ went to 50 after 2 weeks_ and just started the 75mg in week 4.  After a couple of weeks on that she will be at her target dose of 100mg.  One thing I have noticed is that while she still gets angry and can be rude_ she is not out of control in the way she used to be.  She is a good kid and we always knew she did not want to lash out or break things when she got upset; she just couldn't control her anger.  Now she seems to have a fighting chance at self-control.  The only side effects we have seen are a couple of pimples on her chin and some trouble falling asleep at night.,F,10,1  months,5/5/2009,Lamictal

My pysch is starting me off slow with 25mgs for the 1st 2 weeks_ 50mgs 2nd 2 weeks_ and ending up at 100mgs after that.  I know the medicine probably hasn't started working yet but I feel better.

I also take Ambien 10mg (daily) - ambien no longer works for me...even at 20mg daily.I've been taking Lamictal for 18 months at different doses - max was 150mg daily.After doing my own research regarding this medication and other meds for depression_ I've decided to ween myself off Lamictal (I started this four days ago reducing 100mg daily to 50mg daily).Also_ based on my research_ I'm requesting my psyc take me completely off Lamictal and add ""Abilify"" and ""Topamax (may get the excess weight off me).""  If my psyc doesn't agree_ I'm going to fire her and find another psyc Who will agree with my analysis.  I have a MBA degree and have taken my share of psyc courses.  However_ since my ""depression""_ I've come to the conclusion that these psyc meds are basically prescribed by spinning the big drug wheel (done by the psyc) and then prescribing the selected med to the patient.

I have not experienced anything more exciting than hypomania for a couple of years now.  The only side effects that really bother me are the brain fog and short term memory problems which I have only begun to notice after 3 years of being on it. For a little perspective_ Lamictal is nowhere near as bad as Topamax which made me simply incompetent to do my job. I describe the feeling as an ""access failure."" Even when I know that I know something...that I have done or understood perfectly in the past...I am not capable of understanding it. The knowledge just can't be accessed. Same feeling with short-term recall and word-finding.Having just reached ""crisis state"" with the fog thing_ I started taking Deplin (Rx methyl-folate supplement) which is supposed to help the cognitive slurring. I never knew that Lamictal did this until I asked my Dr if the drug could possibly be making me stupid. Her response was_ ""Oh_ yeah_ that's pretty common."" WTF?

620, 5, Bulimia_ ADHD_ Anxiety_ Bipolar,So far_ none at all.  I had been taking Ritalin (a generic) for ADHD. Somewhere along the line_ it was decided that the ADHD contributed to the Bulimia. I do know that without the Ritalin_ I can't focus on anything at all and the binge/purge cycles are definitely far more frequent and intense. After many failures with anti-depressants_ the need to address severe occasional depression_ as well as some fairly intense anxiety_ my psychDoc decided to focus on the dx of bipolar. He ordered me to stop taking the ritalin and start the lamictal at 25 mg_ doubling the dosage every week until I reached 200 mg. I am now at 50 mg. His stopping the ritalin is how I know I can't stop the ritalin.  So_ I'm back on the Ritalin_ per his advice.,As for the Lamictal:  I had no idea how paranoid I was until this morning when I woke up. I always sensed that people at work thought I was weird and that my boss hated me and wanted to get rid of me. To me_ this was almost as real and unquestionable as the sun rises in the east; I just 'knew' it was the truth.  I also wasn't pleasant to myselfI mean that I always berated myself for the lack of strength to do better_ eat better_ please people_ be nice_ be happy_ be successful.  I had no idea how emotionally crippled I have been. This caused me to work at home almost always and gain a lot of weight - although to be fair_ I am now 45 and stopped working out years ago. I actually was able to stop at Henry's yesterday after work - I actually went into the office; that's rare - to pick up some healthy stuff to eat.  And_ last night for dinner_ I ate some and I also ate some for breakfast this morning.  I didn't go through the binge purge situation_ way too much wine and half a pack of cigarettes like I would normally in the evening.  I am not sure if this is a fluke or if the Lamictal has actually been key in this 2 day success story. I do know that I like the person I woke up as this morning and that is something very different.

It hasbeen very beneficial for quite a few months to stop suicidal thoughts_ stabilize my moods and stop the severe depression. I'llkeep going back to this one.  I have taken it with 300mg.

627, 3, Bipolar II- rapid cycling,the first few days_ it seemed to make me energized and almost happy_ and pleasant. However_ this may have just been a mind trick on my part because medication doesn't work that fast. I have been taking it for 2 weeks @ 25mg_ and started on 50mg two days ago_ for week 3.

OCD syptoms have cleared up a bit_ but only because my memory is worse than ever before!!! increase in binge eating_ and increased disconnected feeling and daydreaming.

The hair loss became so bad that the anxiety about my hair made it impossible to continue.  Really unfortunate.However_ I would highly recommend this drug.  It worked SO WELL for me.

I have taken Tegretal_ Lithium_ Depakote_ Seroquel_ Risperdol_ Haldol_ Geodon_ Klonopin_ Zoloft_ Prozac_ to name a few.  All other mood stabilizers caused me to be ""zombie-like"" and made me feel ""not normal due to being extremely slowed down from normal"".  My SSRI was changed several times due to the mood stabilizers previously taken not being adequate....if not making me feel worse than not being medicated at all.  I was put on meds such as Geodon_ and Haldol that both sent me to the emergency room wondering if I was going to die....I always stopped my mood stabilizer (which is typical for BP people). Needless to say after 7 years since my diagnosis_ I was completely discouraged and very hesitant to try anything new due to bad experience.  My new Doctor put me on Lamictal several months ago.  She advised me that it would not cause weight gain and that typically_ everyone seemed to be really pleased with it.  I am more pleased than I ever expected.  Just when I thought no combination of meds_ especially one med alone would ever change my life so much for the better as Lamictal has.

But the side effects are pissing me off. While I was upping the dosage_ I did get dizzy spots_ headaches_ memory problems_ etc. but it went away.I just upped my dosage to 300 mg because I felt like I was backsliding_ feeling irritable_ getting depressed_ and having mood swings_ living inside my head again. Now I am having the same issues with the dizziness_ headaches_ and everything all over again. But I am also feeling really manicky.

Recently added a bit of Topamax to it for weight loss_ but have no plans to get off the Lamictal. The generic is now available by Teva (I know_ I know--they're not the most loved generic pharma)_ but I've noticed nothing different in my moods after taking the generic for at least 6-7 weeks now (neither has anyone else). Lamictal (brand name) is the one med that I've taken consistently and with only minor dose tweaking since I was dx'd with BPII in 2001. I did_ however_ find out that 400mg is too much for me_ and almost immediately I experienced burning_ swelling_ and itchy palms.

I delayed treatment even though I was severly depressed for a long period of time becuase of my past experiences with anti-depressants/anxiety medication.  I have taken Zoloft_ Zeprexa_ Klonapin_ and Cymbalta in the past (when I was 17 - 18 years old).  Even though I didn't take the Cymbalta long enough to let it work_ the other medications worsened my depression to an extreme point where I wasn't myself at all.  It even landed me in jail (I was so drugged out on the dose my doctor was giving me at the time_ I didn't even remember what I did_ or that I was even in jail).

I had 3 suicide attempts since going up on 100mg and subsequently 200mg (I should have listened to my own instincts instead of my dr. who said that the worsening depression was due to my illness and not the lamictal).  Due to these overdoses my psychiatrist of 5 years dropped me b/c I became a liability.  So I took the lamictal he prescribed_ overdosed on meds due to the lamictal and now I currently have no dr. to oversee coming off the lamictal.

I currently take 150 mg of lamictal and 150 mg of effexor. I hope more depressed people_ will try the mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants. I read in the New Yorker once that there were  theories that some scientists thought depression was similar to little mini-seizures...anyway...I agree with the lady who posted that the reason lamictal doesn't have more positive postings is because there are so many people who have been happy with this drug that they no longer need to surf the internet for help.

656, 4, Bipolar II,At this point_ I can't be sure if these problems I've had for several years are a result of the drug or not_ I was not aware they were side effects when I started taking lamictal so I haven't kept good track of when they started but I'm concerned that my moderate acne_ slight weight gain and frequent (very frequent) urination are to blame on lamictal.,I was very satisfied in the beginning because the drug really did even out my moods.  It dulled everything though_ so I went on wellbutrin as well.  But after 5 years of weight fluctuation_ not in my favor_ and increasingly worse acne (which the topical prescriptions including retinol no longer help) as well as being constantly aware that whatever activity I'm planning should take place near a bathroom_ I've had it.  I'm currently weening off my 200 mg dose right now.  I'm honestly scared about what will happen but I've had it with these other aspects to the point that I am at least willing to try and see if this helps my other problems.

Although_after months of taking it my moods became worse_ I became lazy and I was not able to work out like I am use to. The worst thing about this medicine is that you really do feel like a zombie just roaming around not really able to face reality. Another bad thing was the slurred speech and not being able to describe or express things very well_ and that was embarassing!! If you are taking this medicine write down how you feel everyday_ and how you felt before you were on the medication so you can keep a record of the positive/negative effects it may be having.

An early side effect was loss of retention (I need to learn many things quickly in my job) and attention deficit to the point of ADHT. This affects my concentration (ability to function in my job)_ ability to read and relate clearly to people.

I've taken Lamictal for two years and this problem has only just started.,I have been taking a dose of 400 mg daily for almost a year. I also take an adaptogen supplement. It seems that the two have a synergistic affect for me. My psychiatrist and I have made this decision together. At the end of the summer_ I developed severe hypoglycemia. It took several frustrating months (eating 6-8 times/day or risk passing out)before the correlation between Lamictal & blood sugar became apparent.  My typical routine was to take 400mg & my supplement every morning when I awoke. I discovered that if I had not eaten before taking my med_ that with in 20 minutes_ I would begin to have dizziness_ confusion_ & tingling of the lips & tongue- classic hypoglycemia symptoms. Changing the dose of both the Lamictal & the adaptogen to twice a day has greatly helped.I have found_ however_ that the best dosing times for me have been at 10am & 8pm.

The Psychiatrist who initially gave me the prescription did not discuss these side effects with me and none of the many doctors_ including so-called pain specialist thought of looking for the Lamictal for the possible culprit.

Obviously if I keep losing time or my dental problems increase I will want to try alternatives but continuing to live in a mixed state is not an option. It has slowed things down enough to be rational.

731, 5, Bipolar 1,"I have not had any side effects other than being tired if I take it in the morning and noticeable mood change if I miss a dose or two.  My swings are mostly rapid-cycle/ultra-rapid.  This medication has worked to subside the swings.  The only thing I do notice is that I still have mood swings around the time of my period.  They are not as bad as they used to be_ however.  I just give my family and friends the ""heads up"" when it is that time of the month.",Lamictal is the only medication I take for my disorder and I only take 50mg.  I have been on the medication since Dec 2006_ so it has been nearly two years.  I did A LOT of homework before electing this medication and learned that it is imperative to take the smallest possible dose (about 5mg) to start out for the first 2 weeks to a month.  Then increase to 10mg_ then 25_ etc.  I have taken 100mg when I forgot a dose the day before in order to bring my level back up_ with no side effects. But taking 100mg for me is very rare.  I do well on 50mg.There are consequences/other/increased side effects to using Lamictal with other anti-depressents or mood stablizers_ so I haven't used anything else_ and I won't.If you are suffering side effects such as (but not all inclusive) hair loss_ rash_ burning sensations_ sores in the mouth_ nose_ eyes_ etc._ nausea_ vomitting_ Diarrhoea...or anything else that is new for you.....CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR.You may be developing Steven-Johnson,F,38,2  years,10/23/2008Email,Lamictal
732, 4, depression_ mood swings,muscle tremors_ loss of appetite_ higher body temps,After two weeks at the lowest dose (25mg) the side effects are very mild_ but so are the benefits. I don't mind the loss of appetite so much because I experienced the same thing when I started Wellbutrin (150mg). I don't miss those 10 pounds_ but it does pose a danger when I forget to eat all day and my blood sugar plummets. The tremors are not so bad I can't function but they do make carrying a full cup of coffee a bit risky. I've always run a bit warm and had night sweats before the Lamictal_ so I can't say for sure my slightly elevated temps are a result.My doc intends to titrate to 100mg_ but I'm not sure the risks are worth it. So far I've seen a decrease in suicidal thoughts and an increase in energy_ productivity and motivation_ so I may stay with 25mg for a while.,F,34,2  weeks,10/23/2008Email,Lamictal

734, 2, Epilepsy (Partial Complex),Loss of libido - this was a gradual thing that happened over about 3 years until it completely disappeared - have since changed to Keppra but libido still hasn't come back. Also taking Neurontin which has made me lose the ability to orgasm. Other bad things: loss of personality & creativity_ tiredness_ memory loss.,These drugs have ruined my sex-life and I'm only 25! I am so depressed. I feel like a total alien. It's really annoying that I have to keep taking epilepsy meds even though I only had 1 seizure...4 years ago! I have MS too. My only advice to epilepsy sufferers taking Lamictal is to be aware that if it starts reducing your drive (even slightly) then change meds straight away cos you don't want this to happen to you! I would do anything to get mine back!,F,25,3  years,10/14/2008,Lamictal
735, 4, depression_ possibly bi-polar,I'm on both Cymbalta and Lamictal.  When I started the Lamictal_ I started having the following side-effects.  Excessive sweating is the worst.  It seems to hit me worst a couple of hours after taking my dose. I get drenched; it's rather embarrassing to be soaking wet when everyone else is dry. Along with the sweating_ I'm more heat-sensitive and I get more of the migraines that I sometimes get working outside in the heat.  It is also harder to think of words.  I am often hoarse or have a sore throat.  I have gained alot of weight in my years of treatment_ so I pretty much think that all of the medications have that effect on me.  I also have gas problems.  I was prescribed a steroid suppository to shrink hemorroids.  I took two of them_ and I found myself in an angry_ depressed mood.  It appeared to counteract my Cymbalta and Lamictal.,My mood improved_ but I don't like the side-effects. I can't remember how long I have taken it though - 2 years maybe.  Several months ago_ the doctor tried to add a Geodon to my regiment.  I took it for abouttwo days_ I think.  I almost fell asleep talking to someone in my office!!,F,40, ,10/12/2008,Lamictal

After seeing multiple dr's to determine what's wrong with me_ my latest bloodwork revealed a failed ANA(auto-immune) test. Before starting Lamictal_ I had bloodwork_ and all was fine. I'm convinced this drug -- even after taking it for only three months-- is the cause of some auto-immune issue.Off to see a Rheumotologist to get more answers...,Initially_ Lamictal did work for me_ yet PLEASE beware of things such as hair loss.

I went from working as a secretary hospitalized 2x or so a year to being a third year law student looking forward to a challenging career. I still have major ups and downs_ but this drug has really made it possible to live my life.

739, 5, Anxiety/Depression,It was somewhat difficult to adjust to. I was very tired_ no energy. It was difficult to concentrate. However_ once I reached the dose prescribed_ I experienced no severe side effects. I experienced moderate acne which has finally started to subside after my doctor prescribed a antibiotic face wipe. I have also gained a little over 15 lbs - which doesn't seem to budge even with diet and exercise.,I take 75mg. And I also take 20 mg. of Geodon. I didn't realize how  ill I was before taking this med. I'm glad the acne was finally treatable. And I struggle with the weight gain_ but I'm working at it! Regardless of the acne I had in the beginning and the weight gain_ I'm thankful my doctor prescribed this for me. I'm a much better wife and much easier to be around.

More forgetful especially when tired. Insomnia- but I have always had it_ so I don't know if this makes it worse or not. Acne-unfortunately_ that hasn't cleared up- now I see a dermatologist.,Like someone said earlier- it has saved my life. I wasn't able to really see just how sick I was before until I had taken Lamictal (and I did feel it fairly soon after I started- maybe a week to 10 days). I've been pretty stable on it for the most part_ except for during my period- I doesn't work as well during that time and that sucks.I currently take 300 mg per day and have for about a year and a half. It hasn't felt as effective for the past couple of months_ but I see my p-doc today and she might titrate me up (she says there is room to do that)or add something.

Here is a list of the side effects and symptoms that I have experienced while using Lamictal and side effects that are ongoing since I discontinued using the drug.  These side effects are only on a 200mg dosage... Loss of libido (sex drive) which wasn't noticed until 2006 when I got married_ before that I was a virgin so I payed no attention to my hormones.  Short and long term memory loss_ grinding of teeth and biting of tongue and cheeks_ vivid dreams_ weight loss_ acne problems_ drulling of mouth while asleep and when speaking_ anxiety_ mood swings_ impatience_ fatigue_ blurred of vision_ hair loss_ slower coordination and reaction_ slow thinking_ irregular sleeping patterns; sometimes I awaken early after going to bed late after just 4 hours sleep. Lamictal gave me more seizures; major ones and now silent ones. It has neve,It is one of the worse medicines I have been on in my life causing more problems than what I have started with.

When I forget to take a dose_ I become manic_ so I have to use an add on to bring me back to baseline.,Lamictal is a wonderful medication and has probably saved my life.  I had an eating disorder when I was younger and thoroughly researched all the different meds because I refused to be placed on anything that made me gain any weight.  Lamictal was weight neutral for me with very few side effects.  Follow your doctor's orders though and increase your dose slowly.  I went off it once and tried to put myself back on it quickly and got the rash on my face.  It made me learn my lesson.  When used properly_ it's a wonderful maintenance med.  For the body acne_ there are different ways to treat it.  Honestly_ I am so forgetful that it is partially my fault that it hasn't gone away.,F,25,2.5  years,9/15/2008,Lamictal

Lost a little hair in the beginning.  Stabilization properties worked_ because my mood was always around a 3-4 some days were normal at 5 (1 is extremely depressed_ 10 is super manic)  This med kept me at straight 3.  Couldn't function and had no good days whatsoever.  Had no antidepressant properties for me.,I will be getting off this med_ will be 2 years this fall. sought antidepressant and required stablilizer because Prozac put me hypomanic. (not dx as BP becuase only been manic as result of drug.  it is highly suspected though).  The Wellbutrin XL in combination with the Lamictal put me right back to where I was before I started meds.  Not happy ever_ so days sad and angry and ready to give up.  I was upset about the weight gain_ but after adding the Wellbutrin my mood was so flat I didn't care.

Once I got to 200 mg I felt better (not so much depression) but then I started to feel NOTHING. I couldn't feel joy or hope or almost anything at all. I wasn't suicidal or sleeping all the time but I still was not participating in life. I couldn't get excited about something that would make me excited even when depressed. It was awful. I weaned to 100 mg (too fast_ which made me a bit nauseous and disoriented) and was doing much better. I know I have fewer obsessive_ racing thoughts while on it. BUT it doesn't seem an end in itself. My psychiatrist will not prescribe an antidepressant with it but this does not work on depression the way an antidepressant does. I haven't taken my dose in a few days and have not felt withdrawal but worry about starting to take it again if need be,F,35,1  years,8/23/2008,Lamictal

Still_ it exhausts everyone when I ask them 8 times if they did their homework even though I had checked it an hour earlier.  My doctor said these side effects weren't a result of Lamictal.  A second opinion agreed with him.  Also_ the higher the dosage the higher the anxiety. anything above 75 mg. pushed me over the edge.  My appetite decreased significantly.

It helped stabilize my moods enough so that I could process therapy sessions.  After one year on Lamictal my dr. put me on depakote to offset the anxiety.  The depakote boosted my mood and lessened the anxiety.  Currently_ I have had to make a med change.  I am increasing the depakote and tapering off of Lamictal.  Depakote makes me very tired but at least I can think clearly.  I want to work and enjoy life without living with post-it's all over the house.

So I forgot about it when I increased the dose.,Aside from the rash I didn't really have any side effects. It seemed to work well_ although I also took it with Effexor XR (Great medicine if your looking for an anti-depressant that won't make you gain weight).

774, 2, Bipolar Type 2,Weight gain! I gained like 40 pounds_ and it may not be the Lamictal but I didn't gain weight until I got on it. Very vivid dreams. Night sweats. Slight loss of sex drive. When I reached the dose of 200 mg that I'm on now_ I started getting really bad headaches every day. Short term memory loss. People will tell me their names and 30 seconds later I can't remember what they are. I've met people and a week later I don't remember meeting them. Difficulty concentrating. Feeling nauseous in the morning when I wake up_ especially if I haven't gotten 8 hours of sleep or more (and I've been on this for a year!). Having a VERY difficult time getting out of bed in the morning if I miss more than 2 days of the medication. I sleep through my alarm and wake up hours late for work having no recollection of turning my alarm off.,I thought I was crazy when I started noticing these side effects but seeing people saying the same things are happening to them makes me want to get off this drug. I'm seeing my psychiatrist next week and I'm getting off of it. I'm not even sure I'm bipolar because there were a lot of factors going on when I was diagnosed and I'm not going to stay on something with this many side effects if I don't have something really going on.

778, 5, Bipolar II,Possibly slow-healing in-mouth sores.  They've mostly cleared up_ and might not even be related.  Not sure.,I had no idea what a shadow land I was living in before taking this drug.  I was depressed for months (and had cycled back and forth for years_ now that I realize what feeling normal is)_ and though of suicide constantly.  I was skeptical that what I was feeling was real_ and this kept me from seeking help.  Finally a friend convinced me to see a psychiatrist_ who prescribed this drug.  I feel like my life has been pulled back from the brink.  I no longer feel the mystical awe that I now recognize as hypomania_ and this seems like a bit of a loss.  But I don't feel a crushing dread_ either (and the dread was much more common than the awe).  I just feel balanced.  Thanks to this drug_ I can get on with making my life worthwhile_ instead of lamenting its worthlessness.,M,22,2  weeks,7/28/2008,Lamictal

The only other thing I take is Paxil and this counteracts the sleepy stupor from that_ too. Although I get jolted awake from intense dreams in the morning_ I'm not groggy with racing thoughts for the first time that I can remember and the usual triggers don't give me flashbacks. My thoughts are in sync with my feelings instead of being separate. I hope I don't get ""the rash"" or lose my hair over this because it's a miracle drug for me although I'm apprehensive about possible liver damage from it. The side effects are discouraging reminders of what I've been through_ but they're worth it to be able to have normal moods and handle things like cooking and laundry again without a huge effort.",F,47,3  weeks,7/27/2008,Lamictal

I used to have rages that last for 3 days+ and now they last an hour or two and are less often. After first week I realized how much I have missed in life and I now look forward to every new day. I have been on 30+ medications for BiPolar_ Depression_ Anxiety_ etc. in last 12 years and this is the very first that has made a difference. The side effects are tolerable but a few times have been a little frustrating (losing keys_ forgetting what I needed after driving to store_ and stopping mid sentence not remembering what I was saying).

782, 5, Mixed bipolar disorder & dysthymia,forgetfulness_ confusion_ insomnia_ and some mild anger episodes (doctor says those can also be attributed to my Wellbutrin),Lamictal has been literally a life-saver for me. Due to the severity of my disorders_ I take 400 mg/day (300 in the AM_ 100 in the PM because of trouble sleeping). I also take Wellbutrin to help with the dysthymia_ and while my bipolar symptoms have not completely disappeared (I don't think they ever will)_ the differences I've noted are incredible. I am far more productive_ not in a manic sense either_ and_ oddly enough_ am a more relaxed driver as well. I used to have suicidal thoughts years ago_ but after being put on the Lamictal_ those have stopped. I have not experienced any of the blurred vision_ headaches_ etc._ and my sex drive is actually up from what it used to be. I also have made use of consistent_ on-going cognitive/behavioral therapy_ which helps me to come up with tools to combat the forgetfulness_ confusion_ and anger_ and the combination of the pharmaceuticals and therapy has basically enabled me to stay alive and start having as close to a normal life as possible.,F,28,4  years,7/24/2008,Lamictal

Blurred vision sometimes_ not much of a problem.,I would have to say that the biggest issue with me is loss of memory and having trouble putting my thoughts into words.

I give it (and the Dr. who prescribed it) all the credit for my being here 2day. I can not even begin to describe how agonizing the depression I experienced was. It was so bad that I knew I wld only be around for another wk or 2 max. Having only recently been diagnosed with bipolar 1_ this was the 1st med the dr. prescribed & I am so thankful that he did. I began taking it on Sep. 12_ 2007. On 9-14_ 2 days later_ I nearly killed myself. It was the worst pain (all of it mental) I have ever experienced & the only thing that kept me from it was a promise that I made to the dr. when he prescribed it: that I wld give the med some time 2 work & not kill myself. I didn't have 2 wait long bc_ although 9-14-07 was the worst night of my life_ by 9-19 my depression had so diminished that I was no longer the least bit suicidal & felt better than I had in yrs.

No doc would say for sure it was Lamictal.  They said maybe barometric pressure_ maybe having eliminated Emsam.  I now believe it is Lamictal.  I have been on steroids a week.  No barometric pressure migraine ever resisted Prednisone high dosage.  Other side effects: not finding my words (I'm a lawyer)_ and sweating (and smelling) profusely.  Weight-neutral for me.,"Really wish I could stay on it.  It was never clear to my psychiatrist (even with good second opinions)_ whether I was major depressive unipolar_ or a soft bipolar.

I was optimistic_ for God' sake_ never happened to me before on an SSRI.  I was stable mood-wise.  And I hated the not-finding-my-words_ and I hated the sweating.  But I might have stayed with it.

I can't remember peoples' names alot of the time that I've known for years_ I forget some memories from my childhood_ and taking a test is pretty much an Olympic sport for me. Also_ I don't know if it's related but since I started taking Lamictal it's been impossible to get my skin to be perfectly clear.,Lamictal helped with my complex partial seizures and I've been completely clear of any bad ones for 8 months. I didn't suffer  any major side effects_ only memory loss_ but for me that has been the most frusterating-if you explain to people they are usually understanding of the issue and often find ways to aid you. School is a constant struggle for  me and I'm sorry to everybody who suffers from these or worst side effects.

Now_ after almost a month of taking 100mg per night_ I am having night sweats and extremely vivid dreams (not necessarily nightmares). I was prescribed Seroquel to help me sleep_ so I just assumed that these side effects were a result of the Seroquel; however_ now that I read all of the postings of similar Lamictal side effects...I'm led to believe it's the Lamictal.  Also_ I have recently experienced more acne (in locations I've never had it before) and itchy/dry scalp.I was on Lithium prior to the Lamictal_ which I HATED due to all of the negative side effects.  The Lithium blurred my vision and caused forgetfulness and difficulties with short-term memory.  The blurred vision has continued with the Lamictal_ though my forgetfulness has improved.

For the most part_ Lamictal has helped me enormously. I no longer cycle as rapidly_ but lately have had longer depressive episodes than I did when I first started taking it. This could be because of boyfriend problems_ who knows. I find no problem concentrating_ finding the right words_ or having lost my creativity. It has actually helped me focus more. I am able to pull myself out of the bipolar thought spiral before I hit the bottom and lose it.

Had to come off the Zoloft_ and missed it for so long. Eventually_ I went on Lamictal_ after it became clear that I had the highs and lows.... though far more lows than highs.

In October I started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist because I had been in Mania for about six months.  Once the doctor diagnosed me with BP1 put me on Lamictal_ initially with 50mg and titrated up to 200mg.  I am currently sleeping me through the night (roughly six to seven hours_ a change from one to two hours) and my mood is now balanced and I am more focused.

After taking at least 10 different SSRI and Tricyclic drugs_ Lamictal was the first drug that made me feel completely different.  I didn't even know if I was feeling better because the titration was long and produced subtle results in regard to diminshing depressive or bi-polar episodes.  I did get the most common symptoms--dizzy_ body felt like concrete_ itchy_ etc. but they mostly subsided once I reached 100mg/day.  I AM feeling better although my emotions are just under the surface but I can get through the week without crying at commercials (so stupid!) or feeling withdrawn.

But the worst part about this medicine is that it gives me that ""foggy"" feeling...like my memeory isn't wired correctly. Sometimes I can't find words I want to use. It's such a weird feeling. I also have incredibly scary dreams. I dislike sleeping now. I'm still an insomniac. Doctor wanted to prescribe seroquil to help with the insomnia_ but it made me too hungry.",F,18,2  years,4/3/2008,Lamictal

859, 2, BiPolar 2,Started out at 100 which seemed to help with severe depression after a total nervous breakdown in which I stayed in bed for a month_ stopped eating_ lost 25 lbs and would cry uncontrollably when I was awake. MD put me on 100 and I stopped crying constantly and having intense racing thoughts and started functioning fairly normally. Psychiatrist MD upped dosage to 300 and it totally increased my depression. I am able to function 8 hours a day (I work from home)_ but crying daily and hysterically for an hour. I told him that I sincerely felt his original diagnosis of BP was incorrect and that I suffer from severe depression without the mania associated with BP_ so he reduced me to 100 and added Wellbutrin. With Lamictal_ I would sleep well_ but wake up every morning feeling totally groggy_ not well-rested and would take at least an hour to be able to start functioning. Lamictal made me hyper-sensitive and hyper-emotional.,I think Lamictal is miraculous if you're diagnosed correctly with BP. I think my doctor made a quick diagnosis because of my complete breakdown_ without inquiring about possible manic episodes_ which I never experienced.,F,61,3  months,4/2/2008,Lamictal

The hullacinations were the scariest part of getting used to the medication but for the most part the only side effects I still have are dizzyness_ and slower thinking. Im still tired more than I was before I started the medication. This medication has controlled my seizures but I I forget my medication once or twice I have more seziures that I did before I started Lamictal. I dont like the side effects but they are better than having seizures. The only thing I worry about is taking this while Im pregnant. Is ther any one who has taken Lamictal while pregnant? I would like some feedback if possible. Thanks.,F,23,1  years,3/31/2008Email,Lamictal

900, 2, bipolar II/mainly depression,I became increasingly angry an irrational.  I thought about suicide constantly which was not a problem before the lamictal.  One night I raged at my husband and threw things.  Socially_ I behaved as if I had Borderline Personality Disorder and was convinced for a while that I did have it. When I was eventually hospitalized for depression I was paranoid and confrontational until the Dr took me off of it.  Memory loss was severe.,As with other meds_ my doctors insisted that Lamictal could not cause these side effects.  I was not taken off of it until a friend and my husband testified to my dramatic personality change.  My friend even had it marked on his calendar. This was the worst summer I have ever had.  It seems like medicines will sometimes make me worse and the doctor will decide that what I need is more of it.  I am glad that it works for so many people_ but be careful.,F,35,2  months,2/23/2008,Lamictal

I miss highs and lows/feel its all gray/Depression has been dominant. Some anxiety.,I am only taking 100mg a day. I have been taking it at night... perhaps it would be better in the morning from what I have read here. I am wanting to stop use to see how I feel off of it_ though it did help me get through a period without completely selfdestructing. I think my dose could be too low or wrong med... but Prozac made me manic... though I was quite sharp. This has kept me in an uninspired middle zone.,F,33,1.5  years,2/22/2008,Lamictal

I don'tknow if the dosage is now too high or what.  I am now at 400 mg a day.  Once I began the Lamictal I started to have the weird dreams_ headaches_ profuse sweating (which I still get occasionally)_ and odd sleeping patterns.  But now I've had an increase of dizziness_ feeling woozy_ memory loss and sometimes confusion_ and depression.  When I began taking my Lamictal back in 2006 with Lexapro_ I lost 15lbs.  I've remained pretty steady without any weight gain.  But I have a very significant craving for sweets which is not good in my case because diabetes runs very prevelant on my father's side.  If anyone can relate to what I've been experienceing with the increased side effects_ please leave a comment as to your opinion.  I would be very grateful!,F,27,3  years,2/21/2008,Lamictal

905, 5, bipolar_ depression (suicidal),No noticeable side effects - I'm sure that I've experienced them_ but nothing that couldn't be attributed to something else (such as age).,I have been very thankful for Lamictal.  I was VERY hesitant about taking it in the beginning.  I didn't want to accept that I was bipolar and had a major mental illness.  I was VERY scared when I read some of the possible side effects.  The primary reason I took the drug was that I was suicidal and it was just a matter of time before I killed myself.  I figured that I had nothing to lose.  I started on 25 mg_ went to 50 mg a week later_ then 100 mg two weeks later_ 150 mg two weeks later_ and 200 mg two weeks later.  I've been on 200 mg for a little over a year.  As a side note_ my doctor added Lithium (600 mg) when I hit 100 mg of Lamictal_ because the Lamictal wasn't enough.  When I hit 150 mg of Lamictal with the Lithium_ it was like someone flipped a switch and my life was back.  It was just incredible.  I hate mental illness_ primarily because the answers don't come in neat little packages (take two pills and call me in the morning).

914, 5, Bipolar II - rapid cycling,"The first few months I had some issues with getting to sleep and vivid dreaming_ but this was remedied by taking it in the morning. The first month I experienced some mild euphoria which occasionally bordered hypomania_ and when I increased the dose I would often experience some hypomania for a short while (a day maybe). I had some difficulty in word recall and moments of ""going blank_"" which would increase briefly each time I went up in dosage_ but it's leveled off to fairly minimal_ definitely manageable. I titrated slowly starting at 25mg (very important)_ and reached 200mg in a few months. I'm currently at 250/300 due to increased stress in my life_ but 200mg worked fine normally. After a couple months_ I really had no side effects at all except some continued difficulty in word recall.","This drug has been great in helping with stabilization of my moods_ which often fluctuated a few times a day. And comparatively to the other mood stabilizers out there_ the side effect profile is awesome. The word recall thing is annoying but it's better than feeling manically suicidal one hour and planning world domination the next. Some people get tired on it whereas others get insomnia if they take it at night_ so experiment at first. Side effects are minimized if you start low (25mg) and titrate real slow_ and you're less likely to have a bad reaction. I promise you_ just stick with it for a couple months and the worst of it_ if not all_ will go away.

The first time I tried lamictal_ I had great relief with the 25 mg_ then pdoc ramped up to 100 mg_ giving me the most God awful muscle aches_ so off I went. Second time was with in combination with effexor and it didn't help - now I realize it was the effexor I wasn't tolerating. So after I had my tubes tied and no longer have to take birth control pills - which messes with the efficacy of lamictal - I am back on at only 25 mg for about 2 weeks and I am not going any higher.

The side effects are nothing to me_ I can deal with them compared to the seizures. I am on 600mgs a day. They just upped my dosage 1wk ago do to a seizure. I had some really bad side effects the third day of taking the new dose.  They were vertigo_ dizziness_ slurred speech_nausea_blurred vision_and moodswings.

Went all the way up to 200 mg and discontinued the other meds_ but found that 200 mg was too much.  A 100 mg dose of lamictal has been helping enormously with my depression and anxiety.

945, 4, Bi Polar II,I experienced facial break-outs when I first started taking this medicine_ so I stopped taking it for about a month. I was disappointed that I had to quit taking it because it really helped my bi polar condition_ so p-doc recommended I give it another try and started me out on a very lose dose (5 mg) and worked my way up to 100 mg slowly.  This worked and I haven't had any break-outs.  I had some weight gain (about 7 lbs.) in the beginning and an increase in appetite.  I put myself on an exercise and healthy eating program and lost the extra weight_ even though it was quite a struggle.  It seems as though my hair is coarser than it was before taking this med and I noticed slight hair loss.,This med really improved my mood swings and I don't have the depression I once had.  It's really been the only medicine that has helped my condition.  I felt wonderful until p-doc recommended I go on Wellbutrin_ which really messed up my mood_ I was totally spacey and confused_ so p-doc weaned my off of it.  Not quite feeling the benefits of the Lamictal as I did prior to Wellbutrin_ and it's been a good month or so.,F,51,7  months,12/19/2007,Lamictal

I've tried a few other meds (Celexa_ Zoloft & Welbutrin) with no noticible benefit.  Can't tell for sure if the Lamictal is helping. I'm not as depressed as I was before I started it. I've also been trying talk therapy w/ a psychologist fairly regularly over the past year... started the Lamictal 3 months ago & continuing the Lamictal_ but still depressed.  Just today I started taking Wellbutrin again along w/ the Lamictal... hoping to see a noticable difference... trying to keep an open mind_ but not placing any bets.,F,38,3  months,12/19/2007,Lamictal

Now i am up to 100mg and i am starting to feel like i am going backwards in my treatment.  I am also on 150mg of Zoloft.

949, 5, Bipolar II,At 300 mg_ lingering side effects (after initial adjustment): dry mouth_ slight weight gain_ some slight memory problems_ tiredness_ inability to drink alcohol. I'm also taking lithium_ so that could be responsible for some of these.,"This med was terrible to start. It took me a month of feeling horrible_ exhausted_ and uncomfortable in my own skin before things started to get better. I did bump my dose up to 300 all at once (in a few weeks) instead of increasing and waiting and feeling icky over the course of several months. I would increase in this way again_ though. I have tried so many drugs_ and this been the most effective with the least side effects so far. It controls my highs and lows well_ especially the lows.

It does wear off quite quick though so I have to make sure I scatter 25mg tablets throughout the day_ and I can see myself needing to take more as time goes on.  But overall it has done wonders for my concentration_ and even though words are a little hard to find sometimes_ the reduction in partials is beautiful.  I do get a bit angry in the morning_ but I think that's because I always need a coffee so bad. I tried tegretol and it was rubbish_  i'm glad to find this.,M,28,6  weeks,12/16/2007Email,Lamictal

All lamictal seemed to do is amplify all of my symptoms_ my brain fog seemed to get worse_ the only benefit I had was an increased energy level_ but it didn't help b/c I ended up feeling so manic.

My mood is somewhat somber-I will definately tell you what I think as opposed to holding it all in. Experiencing problems with multi-tasking-not because of confusion but because I can't perform a task and think of something else without really concentrating. Definate problems with inversion of Numbers and letters. My hands always seem to be one key over to far! Every med for siezures has nasty side effects-just different. I'm concerned about the hair loss though.

I never knew when I would all of a sudden become nervous and feel like I had to leave wherever I was and often I could not string cohesive sentences together verbally.

I have not been depressed and my moods have been quite stable.  Only in the last six months has it become clear that it's truly the cause of my cognitive problems.

This medication is over-rated.  Physicians love to prescribe it and I believe it is because it is highly marketed and visible in the media as a medication for conditions other than seizures.  For example_ it is marketed as a medication for bi-polar disorder.  This medication was not helpful in the treatment of autism and tourette's in my son.  In fact_ it was detrimental.

986, 2, Bipolar I,Itching_ tired_ fingers swollen_ dry mouth_ irritable and acne.,I am so tired.  I get up from a nap and want to take another one within an hour.  My husband doesn't understand why I am itching all the time_ and I don't either.  Did not know of some side effects until reading this.  Also_ got acne which was very strange for me.  My fingers have been hurting at the tips and read someone else had this side effect too.  I do not feel any better so I think I am going to have to quit and I am actually very frightened to be on it now after reading so many of the side effects.  Glad it works for some though_ just not for me.  I have to start a new job in 2 weeks_ so very concerned about taking this anymore.,F,36,28  days,11/11/2007Email,Lamictal

989, 5, Bipolar,At first_ I experienced dizziness_ clumbsiness_ weird vision (black and spotty)_ also made the room spin.  These all went away.  The side effects that still stick around are:  some numbness_ definitely increased libido_ difficulty concentrating and focusing_ some nausea_ maybe some hair loss_  and I'm tired and lack motivation more often.  I'd take these side effects any day in comparison to the symptoms of my bi-polar episodes.,I've been taking Lamictal in conjunction with zoloft for 1 year and 9 months.  The dosage of zoloft has steady remained at 100mg and definately helps with my depressive moods...but aggravates manic episodes to a dangerous degree.  That's were lamictal comes in to the picture.  I began taking lamictal at a small dose and titrated up slowly as reccomended.  Currently_ I am prescribed 400mg of lamictil (plus the zoloft) and it seems to be the perfect coctail of medications for me.  Right now_ I feel better than I ever have.  The medication isn't exactly a miracle drug_ but it has enabled me to escape the destructive lifesyle choices of a reckless street addict_ homeless commen criminal.  Well_ the medication and a year long rehab.  My psychiatrist_ who specializes in addiction_ prescribed me the lamictal and the zoloft and so far_ so good.  My life is normal...job_ house_ school_ car.  I've been on other things in the past including wellbutrin_ effexor_ celexa_ seroquel_ but the lamictal,F,32,2  years,11/6/2007Email,Lamictal

It seems to subside after I get used to the dosage that I'm on.  Insomnia when I take the pill at night.  Also nausea_ dizziness_ and fatigue_ but like the dyslexia_ this seems to be getting better.,To answer the 10/12 poster's question about Birth Control Pills_ I take Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.  My doctor told me that it does cut the effectiveness of the medication in half_ but said that we can just put me on a higher dosage if necessary.  (For example_ if I need 100mg_ I'll take 200mg.)  It didn't seem like it would be a problem.  Also_ I'm a small person_ which means that a smaller amount affects me as well as a larger amount might for a bigger person.  The same may hold true for your daughter_ given that she is still in her teens and may have a more sensitive body chemistry than an adult.  Talk to her psychiatrist if you have concerns about which BCP to use_ but the impression I got was that it was in no way a problem.,F,30,6  weeks,10/29/2007,Lamictal

Found info that leads me to believe it's the lamictal.,My psych said he has never heard of this side effect_ I'm begining to wonder if I need a new psychiatrist. It was wonderful at first at helping my depression but I couldn't stand the aches and headaches. As soon as I stopped_ they went away.

I also have concentration and memory problems_ but it is hard to pin down to Lamictal.,I stopped taking lamictal without the doctor's knowledge.  I had no withdrawl symptoms that I noticed_ but I had a seizure a couple of months later.  Then I started taking the last prescribed dose_ knowing that there could be problems.  They were much worse than I expected.  I had nausea_ blurred vision_ extreme fatigue_ vertigo...  I went back to the neurologist after that and worked up to the normal dose.  Please be ware of starting lamictal by yourself after going off of it.  Another note - the nuerologist will not admit that tegretal and lamictal have given me an irregular heart beat_ but the cardiologist and my endocrinologist agree that it must be.  It is not concerning enough to treat though_ so I guess benefits outweigh the costs.,F,34,2  years,10/29/2007,Lamictal

My ever-persistent insomnia has only gotten worse_ as I have moderate bi-polar disorder and_ according to my doctors_ this seems to be the result of the medicine only treating the depression phases.,Lamictal is a wonderful drug. It has done wonders to help me function by taking away my depression_ has improved my overall mood (not too much like an SSRI)_ and has helped me maintain order in my formerly messy lifestyle. Moreover_ the side-effects have been minimal_ and I have been able to deal with most of them. Finally_ I've noticed a marked depression when I'm off my meds for only a few days time_ end up sleeping in to ungodly hours_ and can hardly focus or get work done.

My question is her acne has become pretty severe and our dermatologist wants to start her on birth control pills to see if it will help (since nothing else has). We do not want to start accutane at this time. It appears all BCP's have a drug interaction with Lamictal decreasing Lamictal's effectiveness by 50%!!!!

One of the only downsides is that it loses its efficacy pretty quickly_ and I have had to updose 5 times over the past 2 years.  At least for me_ my impulsivity and mood-swings have decreased significantly_ but Lamictal's ability to control my depression hasn't been as impressive (thus why my dose continues to increase).  My psychiatrist just recently told me that most patients on Lamictal have the best results if a very low dose of Lithium is added as a supplement to it.  I've yet to try this combined therapy_ but I may in the future.  Also_ I'm using Lamictal in combination with Adderall XR to control narcolepsy.  The anti-convulsant effects of Lamictal alone have GREATLY decreased the frequency of my attacks - that in and of itself has made the drug a godsend.,F,29,2  years,10/10/2007,Lamictal

1028, 5, bipolar II rapid cycling,various annoying side effects since I began but they all seem to pass after a few weeks. They include short-term memory loss/lack of concentration_ leg tremors_ and severe headaches (which still occur from time to time). Have also been experiencing chest congestion for the past 6-8 weeks but don't know if it related to the drug or not.,Lamictal has worked very well for me. After about 5 years of severe depression/suicidal thoughts I feel consistently happy_ productive_ and healthy - almost to the point that it is unsettling since the mood is so different than that I had grown accustomed to. I do feel like the highs are a bit more dumbed down than I'd like but it is the price to pay I suppose.,F,32,1  years,10/9/2007,Lamictal

1031, 4, Bi Polar/BPD,I had some trouble sleeping at first_ which led to some crankiness.  I went a week with about 3 hours of sleep per night.  I started taking an anti-histamine_ which helped with that problem.  Sometimes I see little sparkly dots in my eyes when I stand up to fast.  The sparklies replaced what used to turn black when I stood up too fast.  I can't seem to think of any other side effects at this time_ but I will post more if I remember or experience more.,I feel like Lamictal has helped me so much.  To be honest_ I don't know if it is psychological or the Lamictal itself.  I have only been taking it for three weeks_ but I almost instantly felt better.  As I mentioned in the side effects section_ I was sleepy for a week or so_ which caused crankiness.  I was told that I could take this medicine with an anti-histamine.  I thought that would be a good idea_ especially since I was having trouble sleeping.  I bought some store brand Benadryl and since then I have had 0 side effects.  I feel my mood has leveled out.  I still get irritated sometimes_ but there is no such thing as an easy way out_ at least not in my opinion.

I don't know if it's from the drug or something else that is wrong.First i started getting migraines_acne and panick attacks. (which i could handle) then a few months ago i started having problems when speaking. In the middle of a sentence I made this noise which is sudden and involuntary and no one else seems to notice except me. I am trying to explain the symtoms to my neurologist but she doesn't seem to understand. I feel like i am having a seizure in my mouth?

I felt bloated and decided to taper off the Prozac. Now I'm off it completely_ but I miss it.

In the past 4+ years I have also taken Celexa_ Wellbutrin and Effexor in different dosages and/or combinations.

But about 3 months ago we increased my dosage due to some PB symptoms_ from 200mg to 300mg - but I have adjusted back to 200mg. I was having the following side affects: short term memory loss which was constant_ dizziness_ and increased muscle twitching.  Not to mention the extremely high cost - wish it was a preferred medication.  Currently I am on 300mg Wellbutrin and 200mg Lamictal.  I am hoping to go off both medications and am looking for others that have done the same.  I am hoping that with regular exercise_ changes in my diet and vitamin therapy I will be successful.  What have others done?,I am concerned about the long term side affects.If you have been weaned off Lamictal please contact me . . .,F,43,1.5  years,8/31/2007Email,Lamictal
1070, 3, Bi Polar 1/Partial Seizures,Initially_ insomnia.  Then_ dermatitis around my nose and upper lip.  Also_ my skin has been sensitive -it doesn't feel good anymore when my boyfriend lightly rubs my back (it's creepy now).  Then_ about 5 months into treatment I noticed a weird taste in my mouth- from very acidic to bitter/sour/soapy taste_ which has not gone away. I also developed acne on my forehead (which I never had before). Recently  my doc increased my dosage from 100mg to 150mg (due to  added stress) and I have noticed that my tongue and mouth feel a burning sensation (in addition to the awful taste).  My tongue is swollen and I have a sore throat.  My GP put me on an acid reflux med to see if the taste in mouth goes away (no such luck yet). My lips are sore too as well as the upper and lower palate and gums.  And now after being on 150mg for one month I am having my third bout of cystic acne; huge painful_ cyst-like pimples that once start to heal only break out again.  I am going to tell my doc that I want of,I can't tell if this drug made a difference in my mood.  My boyfriend says it does.  I'm still depressed but can't tell if it's situational_ or all the negative side-effects I'm experiencing.  I will say that my partial seizures have ceased entirely.

I will eventually dose up to 300MG. The only thing I noticed so far is that I am easily sidetracked at work. Sometimes I lose a thought right in the middle. I have more sudden outbursts of anger than normal for me.  So far my doctor told me that is probably situational and not the medications because I am at such a low dose for my size. I do notice that my emotions no longer distract me from doing my job.  I am way more focused and productive than I was before with the exceptions of getting sidetracked with other work.

I am now seeing a new psych_ that wants to take me off of celexa_ she says being on it for that long that has made me immune to it's effectiveness (anyone ever hear of that?). So I am weaning off of Celexa (I was at 60mg_ tapering down and now I'm on 20mg_ and she wants me totally off of it)_ and upping the Lamictal. Started at 25mg_ gradually increasing to 100mg_ but I am on 75mg at this point. I hate it. I am super cranky at the littlest things. I don't know though if it's because I'm taking less Celexa_ or if it's the Lamictal! I'm just SUPER cranky and hate everyone and everything (slight exaggeration_ but that is my general mood_ at least when I can stay awake!) Please email me if  you have any insights or help.

Creepy crawly sensation. (but this could just be me). Takes a long time to get up to dosage but better than getting that rash.  This medication takes time to take effect.,Excellent medication.  Make sure you take this medication on time and regularly.  If I missed one dose_ I had major moods swings. Also be careful of making up for missing a dosage later in the day_ It will give you a major nightmare. My doctor split my dose (250 mg) into 100 mg in the day and 150 at night (I use to be half and half)_ And I sleep better now.

1123, 2, Bipolar II,Excessive hair loss/thinning,I was hopefully after being diagnosed as Bipolar II that this would help.  I was tapering up on my dosage_ and when I reached 100mg on week 5_ I noticed my hair was coming out and thinning at an alarming rate.  I could not run my fingers through my hair without pulling out at least 30-50 strands.  I immediately tapered off it_ finishing about 2 weeks ago_ and my hair is awful.  It's finer than my one-year-old daughter's hair (which sucks_ because it's down to my mid-back)_ and though the loss has slowed_ it's still significant.  This may sound shallow_ but I am getting married in 5 weeks_ so this is very disappointing for me.  I will work extra hard to figure out a way to control my disorder WITHOUT meds that destroy my hair.

For the first few weeks I had some difficulty with memory and word recall_ but this went away with time.  I sometimes experience more vivid dreams_ but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Otherwise_ no side effects of note.,This is an excellent medication that has significantly improved my life.  After having tried Lithium_ Depakote_ and many other anti-depressants_ I was frustrated.

1127, 4, Bipolar II,Vivid bad dreams.,About 4 months ago I was finally diagnosed with Bipolar II after 10+ years of different antidepressants that didn't work.  It took a breakdown to get a proper diagnosis.  I take Lamictal along with Lithium.  I am now a completely different person.  I am no longer angry_ which feels very strange.  When a feeling is constant for so long_ it feels like something is missing when it's gone (even though that's a good thing).  The only side effect I've noticed is vivid bad dreams.  They started when I was upped to 150 mg.  I'm now at 200 mg and they are still occuring.  But I feel so much better otherwise_ I'm not willing to give up my new meds.  I don't remember having ANY dreams on the antidepressants.  Maybe my brain is just making up for lost time.,F,32,4  months,7/6/2007Email,Lamictal
1128, 4, depression,Over 125 Mg lots of intense dreams. I agree with the person who said take it in the morning only. It makes me stay awake so I would sleep less. The problem is that I would get fatigued from no sleep and I think I would have all the range of sleep depravation problems (confusion_ anxieta_ anger_ depression etc.) simply from lack of sleep_ even though my concentration and attitude was improved during times that I did sleep. I dropped to 125 from 150mgs and it seemed right for me.,One thing that is published that seems true is that lamictal seems to have a very narrow sweet spot for dosage. also lamictal seems to react with other drugs and can vary the effect of lamictal. Caffeine use is NOT good. Caffeine use may also cause the skin problems associated with lamictal. Dosing is sensitive_ too much and you loose sleep too little and nothing happens. My only problem at first was that when I started up near the 100 mg level nothing really happened. I then started taking 150 mg and then I could not sleep. I felt great at first but I got so exhausted from no sleep. Finally I was taking a 100mg and a 25 mg for 125 total. I think it really was good. My concentration was better_ I did feel better. I was more alert and I seemed to be making better decisions. I took it for about a year.  I stopped taking it about 8 days ago and I have been very tired.

Had been on prozac for years until needed to increase dosage and increase created some mania. With prozac_ I felt there was air in my brain which lessened the feelings of depression but with lamictal (on 300 mg)_ I just feel NORMAL. It's like my default setting is now happy_ contented_ energetic_ even joyful_ after a life of depression. Therapy has been so much more effective and life changing.I understand why they don't give it readily_ but this changed my life and I wish it was given more commonly_not only a last resort for depression.

I'll be stopping at 85mg for a long time to see if that is enough to handle the mental stuff without risking another  heart episode.  my doctor had not heard of this side effect when it first occurred_ but since has heard of a few cases of exercise intolerance with similar symptoms.  I live at over a mile high_ so just living here is a form of exercise. apparently no damage is being done to the heart_ just a functional problem.,having emotional resiliency has made all the dosage problems worth it. even at the lower dosage I feel some positive effects. just feeling what it must like to be 'normal' for those few weeks @ 90mg has given me hope.,F,38,7  months,7/2/2007,Lamictal

But at higher doses_ I experienced more erratic mood swings_ coupled by unexplained crying and meltdowns. In the end_ I started feeling so terrible that I felt like I hit a wall and could not go on.

I have been taking a short nap after my dose too_ and that helped_ but I think this drug can make you dehydrated if you are not a water drinker. I did see online that you are suppose to drink it with a full glass of water. I was given a starter sample and that direction was not on the packaging. It may have been in the pocket directions_ but you would think if they were so particular about taking it slowly over a month period_ the full glass of water might be important.

I became feverish.  I called my psych and she sent me to a dermatologist (conveniently it was her husband).  He biopsied a piece of tissue from my thigh and called several days later to tell me it was a reaction to the medicine (Stevens Johnson).  I stopped taking the meds the day I went to the dermatologist.,"I cannot say that this medicine worked_ but also cannot say it did not work.  Since I'm allergic to the medicine I guess I'll never know since I had only been taking it for 2 weeks when I had to cease taking it.  Lucky me - the 1 out of 3000 it's prescribed to that has a reaction.  I was so hoping that this would be the ""magic pill"".

He was doing ok with the 25-50 mg_ but when he began taking 100 mg_ he started having debilitating headaches (immense pressure)_ nausea_ tingling and heat waves over his body_ anxiety attacks and had absolutely no energy.  The effects were so devastating that he couldn't function or go to work. Nothing improved and my son became very weak from not being able to eat for so long. he informed his doctor he wanted to stop taking it and go back on the Zyprexa.  It's now 6 days after he stopped the Lamictal and began taking the Zyprexa and he's still having waves of pressure headaches_ low energy levels_ some anxiety and lack of energy_ although_ overall his condition is slowly improving.,M,43,30  days,6/4/2007Email,Lamictal

Side effects:I may be having a slight problem with jumbled speech_ but my thoughts are coherent_ and I'm able to catch my mistakes and correct them (something you rarely do when in the grip of mania).  Lamictal may also be causing me some insomnia_ so I take the dose (500 mg) in the morning_ and take a sleep aid at night. Possible interactions:  Gabapenten tolerance excellent.Abilify caused extreme hypomania. I stopped Abilify after only one month.  Seroquel (100-200mg) caused severe tardive kinesis_ sluggish thought_ impaired short term memory_ and sleepiness.   ,I've been taking the drug since about 1999 with excellent results and minimal side effects.

Random feeling of water trickling over my fingers (almost like they are falling asleep).  Decrease in sexual activity.  Concerning rash and sores in my mouth.  Doctor lowered dosage per day from 200 MG to 175 MG.  After this the rash and sores cleared up.  IF YOU EXPERIENCE A RASH CONTACT YOUR DR. right away...it can be very serious,Prior to taking Lamictal_ I quite literally had a nervous breakdown.  I was incapable of functioning and was absolutely exhausted and overwhelmed.  By combining therapy with Lamictal_ I have returned to feeling much more stable.  I was clearly suffering for many years prior to my recent breakdown_ and feel like I am my old stable self again.  Keep in mind if you are Bi Polar_ do not confuse the illness with the medication.  For instance if you begin suffering from insomnia_ it is likely due to the illness and not the medication.  In my non professional opinion_ stay on it unless you have the rash or sores.,M,29,2  months,5/20/2007Email,Lamictal

Emotional_ crying for no reason. Felt like I was kind of going crazy_ confused. EXTREMELY weird thoughts_ not exactly voices_ just very weird thoughts. (Definetely not something I've ever experienced!) Slept better than I've slept in awhile_ but vivid and detailed dreams. I of course called my doctor about all of this_ she suggested I take 25 mg of antihistamine for one more night (after 3 days of this) and that was the end of all of the horrible side effects for me!2nd week to now: Most side effects completely gone_ only ones that remain are the occassional 'mental fog' where I can't think of a word and just go blank. But it's been humorous so far and hasn't happened very much. And the second is some slight OCD-like behavior.,It's been great for me. If you can get through the first week of a new medication it's worth a shot to see if it'll work. Everyone reacts differently to medications and you have to give it time. All of my horrible ones were over after the first week and I'm SO glad I stuck with it because it has helped me tremendously.

I had a big blow up with my husband last night about me not doing my part as far as taking care of our home (laundry_ cleaning - I've pretty much shut down in the last 3 months) that caused me to run to a closet and shut myself in for about 15 minutes_ but I attribute that to my existing condition and the fact the medicine hasn't really kicked in yet.,I am hoping this medicine will do the trick for me - my bipolar was a response to the stress of being a stay at home mom of young children (3 and 1)and my husband working out of town up to 3 weeks at a time on a routine basis.  My psych said I inherited a mood disorder from my mom's side.  My grandfather was treated numerous times for depression before he died_ but that was 25 years ago and I really think he was bipolar and misdiagnosed.  He was the same age that I am now when he wa first diagnosed with depression_ but his was precipitated by returning home from WWII.  My psych said that there's a genetic link and that we both incurred a major stressor at the same age.  I will be so happy if this doesn't cause weight gain because with my post-partum depression and rounds of Lexapro and Wellbutrin I put on 30 lbs in 3 months after losing all of my baby weight plus some.,F,31,4  days,5/17/2007Email,Lamictal

I'm now on it alone as a mood stabilizer (given up on the depression_ nothing works for me so far) and the side effects have become much worse.

1191, 3, Depression,It's become difficult to retain what I read. When memorizing_ I briefly remember info but by the next day most is forgotten.  It takes a lot of effort to express ideas nowdays.  My brain seems to be in a fog.,Over the past two years Wellbutrin 300mg and Lamictal 100mg have worked effectively to combat depression but during this time the effects I've described have become  progressively worse. I suspected shortly after starting Lamicatal that it was affecting my memory and ability to concentrate but its purpose was to take the edge off Wellbutrin and it worked. My secret fear has been that I'm developing dementia but maybe the problem is Lamictal.,F,55,2  years,4/29/2007,Lamictal
1192, 5, Bipolar I,Some skin irritation_ mostly in the beginning_ and slight issues forgetting or misspelling words_ but which generally never happened to me in the past. Haven't really experienced any of the other side effects mentioned here.,I am at 100mg and this drug has seriously saved my life. Instead of the madness of mood swings_ I am completely balanced and I feel consistent like I did in my teens. This was my first bipolar medication and I haven't experienced anything really negative to date. In the beginning I did have a few inconsistent spells_ or brief periods of depression_ but I haven't experienced that in quite a while.,M,28,90  days,4/27/2007,Lamictal
1193, 3, Severe Panic,Lethargy_ inability to concentrate for long periods of time and social carelessness.,I have been taking 900mg (2x200mg in morning and 2.5x200mg at bedtime) for about 2 years. I was on a lesser dose the years before. I have had a rough time but not sure if it is Lamictal or the other drugs. I have used topomax and lyrica. Both had side effects that were awful. Topomax - could not sweat and no libido. Lyrica - weight gain like mad and it simply did not work weel. Plus it made me really sleepy. I guess Lamictal is ok..but it alone was useless.,M,40,5  years,4/27/2007Email,Lamictal
1194, 3, bipolar,during my second hospitalization for mania_ the doctor started me on 100mg and i developed the rash. second time around i didn't get the rash_ and it has helped me stay stable_ but i've had SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN_ about 30 lbs in 3 months. i feel like the drug company is full of shit_ and my doctor says there is no better medicine so i can't go off of it. plus i still havent gained back my comprehension and writing skills_ i have such a hard time with school work nowadays.  the weight gain made me so depressed that he put me on wellbutrin_ which may have helped the mood a little but doesnt do much. now im taking an anorexiant_ phentermine_ as well_ but while it has curbed my appetite a little_ it doesnt work nearly as well as others say it does. i guess it probably has a wierd reaction with the lamictal. almost willing to try topamax to get this weight off...,i guess most ppl don't experience weight gain_ but if you do_ make sure to tell your doctor.  maybe we can spread the word that this drug isnt actually weight neutral.,F,19,3.5  months,4/27/2007Email,Lamictal

I'm getting about 4 hours of sleep at night and I've lost 20 pounds in 3 months! The problem I'm having with just dropping this medication is that the drug does seem to help a good bit with mood & depression. My doctor started me with 25mg and moved me almost immediately to 100mg. He has agreed to drop my dosage to 50mg do to the side effects. Hopefully this will help.,M,35,3.5  months,4/26/2007,Lamictal
1196, 2, Grand Mal/Psycho Motor Seizures,Wowwwww_ where to beginI am experiencing several side effects from this drug. The worst is the memory loss and confusion. I have problems spelling even common words. At times I cannot remember what words mean or how to use the correct word to express a thought or feeling. I loved working with numbers but I've been unemployed 6 years now_ mainly due to this specific reason. Every memory side effect you see listed on all of these blogs_ I suffer from.,I've had seizures my whole life (41 years) and have been on almost every med possible_ but when I started on Lamictal_ memory and ability to spell became my worst side effects_ and I thought It was the brain damage caused by my seizures that was causing this problem. I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one. I'm on 3000 mg of Keppra and 700 mg of Lamictal_ and I've found that my seizures have gotten worse since I started Lamictal. The only good thing I can say about any med used to control my seizure disorder is that it has built up my immune system_ because I have not been sick since I was 15_ and I am now 41. Well I'm going off Lamictal to try Topomax_ and the only thing I fear with that med is Kidney Stones. So anyone who has been on that med and has any advice_ it would be nice to hear from you.,M,41,2  years,4/26/2007Email,Lamictal

But it was long enough for these side effects to take place.  I didn't realize that's what it was from at the time.  They haven't gone away since.  I just started again_ and only came here to check out weight gain as a side effect and now it's all coming back to me.  It's scary but at the same time_ I remember this drug being the one that actually helped me the most.  So which is more important considering it seems the damage is done and it did help.  Damned if you do and damned if you don't.,F,27,16  days,4/25/2007,Lamictal
1200, 5, Bipolar,I dont remember if I experienced any noticeable side effects when I first started the medicine_ but I was aware what the minor side effects were and I think my body just got use to them.  Never had acne/rash as a side effect.  But_ last July_ I began having neurological problems (trigeminal/occupital neuralgia) and I pieced together problems that Ive had since 2004_ but they are getting worse.  The side effects of Lamictal mimic symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis.  Some of the similar symptoms include:  Memory loss_ confusion_ hand tremors_ feelings of exhaustion_ loss of balance_ intense itching_ blurred vision (only my right eye though)_ etc.,Started with 100mg for first 3 years_ but increased to 300mg per day... 100mg in morning and 200mg night.  Has anyone else noticed additional side effects with long-term use?  My other neurological symptoms include:  Body stiffness_ drift into a wall or object_ unable to maintain body temperature (cold hands/feet)_ out of breath_ sharp muscle pain_ tripping over feet_ tight/stiff wrists_ stiff/sore joints_ loss to hearing_ changes in eyesight_ electric-shock like pain on right side of face only._ etc.  The side effects/symptoms never occur simultaneously... one day I will have one problem and then the next day I will have another problem.  Does this sound familiar?,F,40,4  years,4/24/2007Email,Lamictal
1201, 4, Epilepsy,Started in the beginning with severe nausea/dizziness_ rash_ swollen glands.  Eventually went away.  After reading this_ I realize why I have bad night sweats and acne.  It also may be interacting poorly w/ my birth controll pills_ which causes me to have periods at least 2 out of every 4 weeks.  Also possible sexual side effects.,I've had less than 10 big seizures in my life (2 were caused when I took herbs (don't do that).  I used to be on Depakote but switched b/c this was safer.  Overall_ it's great for the tonic-clonic_ but I'm having the jerks that didn't start until about 6 months ago. I just came off of Depakene_ which I took for the jerk-type seizures. I stopped b/c it made them worse and it is more dangerous. I'm getting married soon and this is the safest drug in the case that i would get pregnant.  I just wish I would have known that all of these side effects were from my meds..it's not going to be fun getting married with acne and a 2 week period.  :(,F,24,1.5  years,4/24/2007,Lamictal

1203, 3, Depression and Anxiety,I have been taking Luvox and Klonopin for years to help battle my depression and anxiety.  Recently I noticed that I was feeling depressed for extended periods of time.  In light of this_ I contacted my doctor and we determined that I should take a mood stabalizer_ Lamictal to help with the depression.  In the past I tried several different medications mostly SRIs with terrible side effects.  Luvox worked the best in terms of tolerable side effects until now.  I've been really depressed  while taking Luvox and frustrated and angry because I'm tired of taking medications and dealing with the side effects.  It has now been 14 days on Lamictal and I do feel that it has helped with my depression but has also added 5lbs. of weight gain to my body.  This is not acceptable - I used to be a size 2 and I'm not fitting into any of my clothes!

Without it I was unbearable to myself and others.  Had to continually apoligize for my bizarre actions. Libido was out of control_ and crying all the time.  My highs were wonderful and I denied I had any problems whatsoever which created many unpleasant disageements with others.

However I did not seek treatment until 5 years ago.  I have been prescribed almost every antidepressant out there.  Most would start out working then stop.  Finally I was prescribed the max dose of prozac (80mg) and it completly took care of the OCD.  I just didn't care.  However_ depression and feeling exhausted was still an issue.  So_ my doc augmented the prozac with everything from provigil to adderall.  Then not only was I depressed_ but I was anxious.  THEN_ as I was about to give up on the whole medication thing_ she gave me lamictal.  Starts out really slow_ but once I got above 100mg_ it's been amazing.  My entire preception on life has changed_ I have energy_ I have empathy_ I feel connected to people.  I do not coward away in social situations.

1228, 4, Seizures,Horrible horrible cystic acne which flares my rosacea.  Didnt realize at all that the Lamictal might have been the cause.  Am shocked that others have experienced this too.  I have never in my life had any problems with acne before taking medications (this and the BCP are to blame).  Ive been off the BCP for 2 years and the acne is getting worse and cystic (the bcp just gave me small white bumps)!  I also have the memory problems.  Didnt attibute this to lamictal either.  Now i feel alittle better that im not a big dummy.  Am studying to be a math teacher and have no problems with numbers or math but when it comes to writing papers for my ed classes or talking in class im just plain dumb.  Definately have problems with vocabulary which i never had before.  vivid dreams (mostly good ones) and very minor muscle aches (but this is likely because of my job as a waitress).,Had 10 SPS and 1 complex partial.  Have not had any since being on this medication.  Am going to talk to my doc about weening off it.  He said he wanted me to be on it for 3 years but i think my seizures were so minor that i can come off sooner. *fingers crossed*.  Would be nice to finally have my skin clear again.  Its terribly disfigureing and honestly hard to go from being pretty to looking like scarface which makeup can hardly cover.  :(   I probably wont go on any other seizure meds because I might want to have kids someday and my neurologist said its much harder especially for women intheir 30's to conceive when on most seizure meds.  He said lamictal is the best in that respect.  So as far as seizures go this med works great with the only major side effect a superficial one.  This however is a huge one for me.,F,28,2  years,4/8/2007Email,Lamictal

I'm only at 100 mg per day and at this dosage_ I feel kind of ""flat"" with some mild break through depression.  I had hoped that my ""normal"" was a little on the higher end_ but maybe it is too early to tell.

Far worse than that_ though_ was the scary double vision I started getting -- I literally could not see straight. This not only made it VERY difficult to walk and drive and almost impossible to read_ it also gave me seriously horrible headaches.  Cutting back to 150 has stopped both reactions.,This stuff is fantastic! I have severe_ frequent mood swings and crippling depression_ and this has eliminated most of it.

I have backproblems and body pain which is  inceased by weight gain_ so I may go off it_ although I am much more stable emotionally_ crying  a LOT less. Its  a hard tradeoff and I havent decided yet.   Also_ I cant afford  at all  to replace my wardrobe!

Went to a diff. Dr. who gave me Rx for Topamax (aka DOPAMAX) which combined w/Wellbutrin made my manic episodes far more aggressive and depression more suicidal; Topamax put me to sleep every afternoon - was impossible to keep a F/T job.  Finally found a decent doctor who took me off both and started me on 25 mg Lamictal and worked up in small increments to avoid any ""rash"".  So far I've stabilized at 225mg.

I naturally have word- finding problems so I can't attribut that to Lamictal.,Started Lamictal years ago for epilepsy and took Depakote at the same time because it controlled my moods better.  The Depakote had it's own side effects that were bothersome and so I was switched to 100% Lamictal for both problems.  Then I went back to the Depakote- Lamictal combination for best mood control.  Recently_ my neuro. raised my dose of Lamicatal from 150mg to 100mg morning and night.  That is when my present symptoms began.

No hair loss_ headaches_ rash or any of that other stuff.,"Are you guys seeing psychiatrists or just general MDs?  I came off general MD prescribed Zoloft (wow_ that was HORRIBLE withdrawl_ worse than anything I've experienced!) and went on Lamictal.

I love this drug_ it treats my neurons_ not my chemical imbalance and it makes so much sense.  I can't help but wonder if some of the side effects others experience are from mixing SSRIs with Lamictal.  I finally have hope of living a normal life after 30 years of depression.

Initially it did seem to help with the depressive end of my disorder_ but the fatigue at higher doses made me feel more flat and depressed. I am going to speak to my psychiatrist at length about all of the side effects I have experienced with it and see if they can try me on something else.  ,F,35,720  days,1/4/2007Email,Lamictal

Mostly I can laugh at myself at some of the effects but the joint pain and tingling is a bit much. Breathing heavy is also a new one.  After reading some of the other comments I'm hoping to skip some of the other effects. Libido is fine. No hair loss.,If I don't take my meds I notice I am very manic. I had no idea I was so manic until finally after a breakdown in my dr. office did they offer to try lamictal and topamax. For the first time in my LIFE I feel level and can deal so much better with my kids and husband.  I actually can get out of bed in the morning wanting to get out of bed.

Have been on Keppra_ Depakote_ Topamax & now Lamictal.  Keppra made me sleep 12-14 hours a day. So confused I didn't know whether I was coming or going. Depakote made me so depressed. I have been on Topamax the longest & on Nov. 2_06 started on Lamictal.  I started the weird little noise on the 7th.  Haven't had any seizures but I hate Lamictal.  I am now weaning off of it.  I will continue with the Topamax and the Clonipin to cut my brain off in order to sleep.  Hopefully it will work.  This has been the longest 10 months of my life and I would rather have a seizure that to take Depakote or Lamictal.  Maybe my new case of acne will clear up when I am off of it.

Since that time_ I experienced ""anxiety attacks"" that caused depersonalization and dissociation. The lamictal has had no affect on the dissociation and depers._ unfortunately_ but within a month I found myself crying at feeling happy. I still do on occasion very unexpectedly. I have never felt this way before in my life. Maybe at moments but not like this. I feel like I connect with other people now; I'm able to think more clearly and my thoughts feel ""cohesive."" I still get depressed and slightly ""up_"" but it's amazing how the highs and lows seem to stay in a more normal range relative to most people around me.

Seemed_ I say_ because I began having frequent blackouts_ periods of intensely violent and evil feelings that I can only describe as psychopathic... utter indifference to my surroundings and the people therein. If combined with alcohol... ANY alcohol... the symptoms were much much worse. Christmas this year was passed with a psychotically violent and abusive episode that has hurt my family tremendously and that I cannot in any way recall.,For most folks_ the drug works miracles.

Still have my personality and still have good days and bad days_ but the moods don't escalate further than blue or upset and come back to normal shortly (hours).  When switching   to 100mg from 50mg I felt almost intoxicated for two days but quickly adjusted.

Sometimes I've taken just Lexapro without Lamictal (when I've run out of Lamictal) for a few days_ and felt fine. I think Lamictal is supposed to have fewer sexual side effects than Lithium -- i.e._ not suppress your libido -- which is one reason my doc switched me. I got married around the time of the switch. But I haven't noticed any improvement there_ since I also went through menopause around the same time.

While at first I thought it was helping subdue my morning epileptic auras_ it's effects made me feel very frightened about ANY mental stability_ anxious indeed.  Because of the night sweats and insomnia_ I am certain that lamictal was directly responsible for a recent seizure.  My doctor suggested I take an additional 100 mg atop my daily 400 mgs.  After experiencing a most scary mindset that I would have another seizure_ I decided to retain my prescription of dilantin_ which has adequately treated my seizures for 24 years.  There was no other better feeling once I began_ again_ the very first 100 mg of dilantin.  I slowly weaned myself daily of 50 and then 25 mg of the lamictal.

For years I suffered serious monthly depressions even after beginning treatment 10 years ago with anti-cyclical AND anti-depression medications.  Lamictal has been the only drug in that time to put a solid floor under my tendency to get clinically depressed.  It's also added lucidity to my thoughts (I'd accepted Depakote and Trileptal spaciness) and allowed me to lead as normal a life as I've had since my diagnosis.  I have had issues sweating much more often with greater perspiration.  Have taken between 200-1200 mg of this drug over past 18 months.  All the positive comments here are true.  It's wonderful.,,,18  months,9/14/2006Email,Lamictal

I am tired all the time.  Prior to Lamictal_ I used to never be tired during the day_ and was at times a borderline insomniac.  Now I sleep like a rock at night_ but also want to sleep during the day.  I find this pretty inconvenient and annoying.  The fatigue combined with an increased appetite is something I have to be careful about.  Thankfully_ I live_ and have always lived_ a very active lifestyle and have managed to keep the routine going to avoid gaining weight.  I also have trouble finding the right words at times - I feel like my vocabulary has dwindled.  Slight disorientation_ especially climbing or descending stairs - one of these days I'm realling going to crash hard.  I am at 200 mg.

I don't have any of the other awful side effects of other epilepsy medications_ such as sleepiness and stupidity (i.e._ forgetting words and friends' names).  However_ I've experienced short and long term memory problems.  I find it harder to read as well.,This epilepsy medication is better than any other that I've taken. The memory loss is discouraging sometimes_ but when I weigh the positives and negatives_ it's worth it.  I haven't had a seizure in 6 years_ and I have just learned to cope with the fact that I have to concentrate harder when I read.  I would not recommend this drug to a college student_ because the memory and reading effects can be very frustrating and stressful.

About once a month_ I have some mild neurological symptoms associated with migraine but they last less than a day. I have found on occasion that I am hypomanic while on the Lamictal_ but it has also helped me with mild depression.

It is incredibly frustrating when your doctor does not acknowledge the side effects you are experiencing are related to a medication change.

In very peaceful environments and I would feel this way with no stimulation.  They put me on Lithuim first and I hated it.  But this has been an excellent mood stabilizer.  I am happier sometimes irratible but I think its an adjustment thing.  I have had some  diarrhea   dont know if thats normal or not. Nightmares.... man the nightmares.  Trying it during the day now.  I have trouble seeing when I drive at night due to this med.  I think it blurs my vision some.  Thirsty a lot.  Drink lots of water.  Not as hungry as on Li_ Lithuim made you eat like you were starving all the time but this is very even.  No weight loss to state of but I am hopeful.  I am also on 300mg of Wellbutrin and it helps too but in the beginning the headaches were murder but they did go away after two weeks.  A hot compress helped to cope with them and the rewards have been tremendous.  Trouble with some cognitive but not lik,No rash thus far on 100mg Thank heaven above for the help we need!

1455, 5, Depression,None,"I have been depressed almost all my life.  I finally admitted it to myself and that it wasn't normal (you'd think I could have figured that out before now - I'm 46_ but there you are).  The only way I can describe it is being like a ""walking wound"" and having a ""glass is half empty"" attitude.  I'd been on Zoloft and was still on Wellbutrin when I started this (and still am) but they didn't seem to do a lot.  Wellbutrin helped some with energy but that was it.  I talked to my therapist and he said he thought I might be bipolar.  I am NOT manic in that I don't have ""highs"" only constant low and then periods of DEEP lows.  He explained that there is a type of bipolar like that_ but I had no idea.  Frankly_ I don't care what I am labeled.  Anyway_ I went to a psychiatrist to be eval'd for a med and she put me on Lamictal.  It has been wonderful!  I am not ""happy"" per se but I also am not stuck with that ""walking wound"" feeling.

Three doctors have diagnosed me with Borderline and two argue I'm Bipolar. So I suppose the medication works for both.,With the dizziness_ it always happens if I take it too late or miss it completely. The memory loss tends to be short term. Sometimes I can't seem to remember what I said just after I say it. Also my loss of appetite has gotten worse..but thinking it may just be my anxiety issues? Other than all of that... I have held a job for almost 2 years and a relationship for almost 3. Couldn't have done that before the Lamictal.

It really controls my seizures brilliantly. Other medications haven't helped at all and tegretol even made my seizures worse. I'm on 600mg a day which is very high and may contribute to the side effects but it's certainly worth it as it has given me my life back - having seizures makes me very tired and confused.,F,27,18  months,4/23/2006,Lamictal

Helped in the beginning but as usual as with all the TONS of meds I have been on_ the effectivness wears off shortly.,I was told by my doctor that THIS was the medication for me_ a wonder drug for my resistant depression.Well this is simply not true. I have givin up hope of ever finding a wonder drug but_ I am afraid to stop (have before) and end up in bed all day long. At least_ I can functionwith these meds.

I suffered the loss of my dad and granddad since beginning the medicine_ a definite root/major trigger. It allowed me to grieve in the way i wanted to_ without sending me into the depression followed by a manic episode (like before meds). The night sweats suck_ b/c i can never find the right temperature_ especially in light of the insomnia.  Since i have eczema_ i was definitely expecting the rashes_ but they've not come. The nightmares are pretty freaky_ and are so startling that i wake up sitting upright (even though i sleep on my side).

I started getting depressed again this year but I can't seem to take any other antidepressants because they make me too manic and the Lamictal has helped bring me up from my depressive tendencies without causing mania.  In fact I think it also has a calming effect.  I am highly sensitive to meds so my doctor has been increasing the dosage VERY slowly and after two months I'm just now up to 50mg.  My current cocktail is Depakote/Geodon/Lamictal which seems to be working better than anything else I've tried in the past year and a half.

Sometime I cannot remember what I did that day_ but definitely cannot remember specific events of the previous day and recalling specific events prior to that is almost improbable. Long term memory is the only thing untouched_ for now. Verbal loss in that I know what word I want ot say_ yet the word eludes me. If someone is using vocabulary that is more extensive_ I get lost VERY easily. Easily confused if the task invovles more than 2 or 3 steps. Math is almost impossible. If doing a repeative task_ my mind wonders almost immdiately_ something never experienced in past.,Things are so different on this drug. The world is much more lucid. I skip cycles and go weeks without any mood abnormality. Life is great on lamictal. However_ the cognative side effects are starting to disclose themselves more drastically. My psch. thinks it is just my dyslexia_ but I have never experienced this kind of memory loss. I really don't know what to think. My thoughts are VERY LUCID and I feel VERY much grounded in reality; however_ this memory loss it out of control. I will go to work_ and not remember certain events during the day or the events are out of order; also_ I will read a passage_ understand its conclusion_ and 5 mins later_ cannot remember what I read.,M,26,1.5  days,4/10/2006,Lamictal

The MD in the hospital suggested that the cause may be the Lamictal because no other cause could be found.  I begged her not to discontinue my miracle drug.  Well_ when I got home I researched the Lamictal and found that pancreatitis can be a side effect.  The FDA website states there is no percentage of prevalence but it does happen.  By the way the pancreatitis occured within 2 weeks of increasing my dose to 300mg.  Also_ I had been experiencing urinary urgency throughout my therapy with Lamictal (I felt it was a small price to pay for feeling ""normal"").  Within one day of being discharged from the hospital I was in a major dept. store and I was totally incontinent of urine.  Imagine the humiliation !!!

1541, 3, bipolar,1st few weeks very angry feeling--extreme rage ( not sure if it was from the Lamictal or the Lexapro--stopped though in the third week of taking med);boughts of sleeping alot and then not.  Stomach is very upset. Extremely clumsy for about 1 wk (let me say clumsier than I usually am),Pretty much like everybody else diagnosed_ I am constantly on the change your meds rollercoaster.  Usually more than one medication is changed at a time so it is difficult to tell what side effects are from what med or if I am just not feeling well or having a bad period (cramps for that seem to be worse).I'm slowly being taken off Trileptal while my dose of Lamictal is decided on_ was taken off Prozac (which by the way does not work in gereric form and since that is all insurance will cover_ I had to start looking for something else)Lexapro was added and that didn't work_ so I'm REALLY counting on this drug to give me a better life. (I'm just finishing with the starter pack.) Trileptal took away all of the mania but did nothing for the depression (I've been on that 2 yrs and finally told the doctor to get me off of it.)  Lamictal is supposed to cover the area of depression and that is what seems to bother me the most. I honestly pray to God that this drug will work; I've not been suic,F,39,33  days,2/6/2006,Lamictal
1542, 1, epilepsy,I started this stuff very slowly and cautiously_ as I had had nasty side effects before with other drugs.  Once I increased my dose to a certain level_ I found I began to feel extremely anxious_ and by the time I was nearly at the maintenance dose I felt perpetually incredibly anxious_ stressed_ and freaked out.  All the time all day long I had total deep mind and body stress and anxiety_ so physical that I can only compare it to that freak feeling you get when you just dodge being hit by a car_ and you feel so freaked out.  I ended up calling up the nurses sobbing uncontrollably begging them to help me_ to help me oh please god help me!!!_ and finally quit taking the stuff without permission and immediately saw all the freak out anxiety disappear.  Anxiety was the only side effect I had.  After that I started taking Neuronton_ and the only thing that has done to me is to make me feel happy.,For me it was hard core horrid_ truly horrible horrible horrible.,F,27,2  months,2/3/2006,Lamictal
1543, 5, Bipolar Depression,NONE!!! I am very lucky_ I have absoloutly NO side effects,Nothing was working for me_ I was so depressed yet anti-depressants were not helping and in fact at times made me worse e.g agitated_ manic_ anxious. I was very suicidal and it was difficult waiting for the slow titration upwards to a therapeutic level. I was hospitalised for safety and gradually over some weeks my mood improved and I now feel good. I was out of hospital for Christmas. I now take Lamictal 125mg in morning and 125mg in evening. I also take Lithium 1000mg_ Tegretol 600mg and Seroquel 500mg. This combination is keeping me on the straight and narrow at last!!!,F,28,3  months,1/27/2006,Lamictal

1545, 5, Epilepsy,Occasionally after drinking larger amounts of caffeine or getting little sleep the effects of the drug are weakened_ but I suppose that's natural.  Have had some nervous ticks/twitches in recent years_ but I'm not sure if that began after taking lamictal or before.  At times it's hard to concentrate.  Acne was quite exacerbated when I began the drug and lasted for a year or two_ but it has subsided considerably since then.,I was diagnosed with Grey Matter Displacia also in April 2001.  I started taking tegretol and carbotrol and they were horrible for me.  I started taking lamictal after just a few weeks and experienced a great deal of short term memory loss_ but that very well could have been the tegretol.  Overall I am very pleased with the drug.  As long as I take care of myself (get enough sleep and don't drink too much caffeine_ and I never have drunk alcohol) I basically do fine.  I take 150mg/2xd.,M,22,5  years,1/25/2006Email,Lamictal

I'm back taking 400 mg a day_ and though I still get the slightest depressive and manic symptoms_ it's very well controlled.

So bad that my husband is saying you need to call the Dr.  Then I started reading about the hair loss and insomnia. I didn't really think about Lamictal and that...

My psychiatrist started me out with the orange starter kit and things seem to be working wonderfully so far_ but last night my dosage in the starter pack went to 100 mg and I had a terrifying and terrifyingly vivid dream.  It was so disturbing that when I woke_ after 2 hours of sleep_ I was afraid to sleep again (in my dream I murdered someone in an horrific way_ brutally_ and I am a very peaceful person!).

1565, 5, Bipolar 1,I am experiencing several side effects from this drug.  The most bothersome is the memory loss and confusion.  I have difficulty spelling even common words.  At times I cannot remember what words mean or how to use the correct word to express a thought or feeling.  At times I suffer muscle incoordination which has resulted in taking a few tumbles down stairs.  My muscles and joint ache especially in the hip and lower extremities.  I have noticied an increase in acne and itching on arms and torso.,Despite these side effects noted.....Lamitcal has not only improved my life but saved it.  On October 10_ 2005 I had planned on comitting suicide because of depression due to my severe mood swings and inability to cope with the stress of everyday living.  After a stay on the Mental Health Unit my psychiatrist prescribed Lamictal. I started on 25 mg and progressed to 50.  After a month the dose was increased to 75 mg for two weeks and now I am at 100 mg daily.  To my amazement_ I have been noticing some moments of pleasure.  Upon occasion I have awoke actually anticapting my day.  My mood has somewhat leveled off. My capability to function in life has somewhat improved.  I'm not quite where I want to be...but I now have some hope. Currently my meds are: 1800 mg lithium_ 300 mg wellbutrin_ 25 mg elavil_ 200 mg seroquel_ 100 mg lamitcal daily.

I have been taking 200mg per day since that time with no recurrence of seizure symptoms until about a month ago. This occured immediately after a week-long vacation during which I missed about 3-4 doses. The missed doses were only my evening dose. Since I take Lamictal twice/day_ I always took my morning dose.Around that time I had been experiencing very vivid dreams that occur nghtly. They started before the last seizure; however_ their prevalence and intensity has increased over the last month or so.Since I have had only one additional seizure since being diagnosed over 2 years ago_ I am assuming the drug is working.

I get herpes on my chest - but very rarely these days unless I'm in the tanning booth and forget to put on sun block.  I have it in 4 spots on my chest and am constantly putting powder on it.  Yesterday and today I am not depressed but certainly lethargic_ tired_ unmotivated to do my sales calls - this is very unusual for me.  On the other hand - it could be left over from the holidays!  I now have some itching in my vaginal area with a bump - herpes? which I don't get there_ lamictal reaction?_ inflamed hair follical?  I dropped to 100 this morning as my dr is on vacation til next week.  Until I began to experience these side effects I was really happy with it.  I hope the itchiness and the blisters on my chest subside having dropped the dosage.  Otherwise_ adios lamictal,I take it with 100 mg effexor_ which has been great.  I was also on wellbutrin_ but she took me off that because it was causing me to get agitated and reactive.  Effexor has always been fine alone_ but I hit a real hard spot in my life that necessitated increasing the dosage and it still wasn't enough.

She told me to increase to 200 mg because it was a mood stabilizer but I have read it is not very effective for Mania.  I refused and went down to 100 mg and it got a little better.

Taking Trazodone might help some of the people who have the insomnia as it is FOR sleep. This stuff works like a dream.

1574, 3, Yes,I have been on this medication for several years now. Dry mouth_ insomnia_ memory loss_ some kinds of cognitive loss_ reduced sense of smell & overall sensory perception. All these go away within 2 days if I stop the medication so I doubt I am imagining it. There IS withdrawal if I miss a dose for more than a few days and for me_ it consists of acute anxiety accompanied by some confusion and irritability.,So_ with all of this_ why the heck would I continue with it? Because it has not caused any sexual side effects (important for me) and keeps my mood relatively stable without causing me to become completely numb and disconnected to the world as other medications have. However_ withdrawal symptons are a MAJOR problem if I miss a few doses and this potential scares me if I were to lose the bottle during a nice vacation.,M,41,3  years,12/22/2005,Lamictal

I also had to deal with fainting spells for a few months_ generally after I had not had a good nights sleep. As a side effect of lamictal_ I have very mild acne_ and am more likely to develop cysts. I had some problems with very vivid dreams_ which went away once I decreased the dose from 175 to 100 sucessfully. The tremor which I developed when going on lithobid also subsided after decreasing the lamictal.,Lamictal has been part of a really functional coctail for me: Lamictal: 100 mg_ Lithobid: 600 mg_ Zonegran: 50 mg_ and Concerta 36 mg for ADD/depression. I am emotionally stable_ but I don't think I'm an emotional drone. It's help eased some of my anxiety; and I'm no longer labile like I used to be.

We have not noticed any changes in his learning_ sleeping_ or memory.  He is an A student and also participates in Marching Band.  His doctor said there is a good chance he will outgrow the seizures and could be off the Lamictal by the time he is in his early 20's.

Peyton gets so irrate that there is no calming her down_ she just needs to exhaust herself.  She screams and cries over the littlest thing.  She is so violent that she uppercuts the 2 year old and throws her to the ground.  She doesn't hesitate to hit whoever...but more often than not_ she just destroys things. She rips wall paper off of the walls_ breaks toys_ pours stuff on the carpets_ digs holes into the leather furniture....just for starters.

She has had a tough time getting to a therapeutic level though_ as she was just increased to 200mg twice daily.  From what I have read_ that is a pretty high dose.

Minor-to-medium-severity rash began on 50 mg/day (thought it was probably poison ivy at that point); I went to 100 mg. I titrated on the exact schedule laid out by the Lamictal starter pack. Then I went to 150 mg and I was sure I had a Lamictal-caused rash. My psychiatrist wasn't terribly alarmed about the rash. Neither was I--I wanted to keep taking Lamictal. He said it was a common ""drug rash"" that can be caused by a number of drugs. I dropped dose from 150 mg to 100 mg for about three weeks. Rash went away. Went back to 150 mg for a couple weeks; no more rash except maybe some itching late in the evening. I've been on 200 mg for 1-1/2 weeks.

The plan was have me on just Lamictal and Topamax. That project failed_ oh well_ but during that time_ my mood really leveled out nicely_ and we left it.  A subsequent depression really allowed the Lamictal to do its thing.  WOW!  My doc bumped it up_ and literally within a few days I was feeling better.  This stuff is great.

My new doctor raised it (gradually) to 200mg_ and now I really see a difference. I want to add to those exeperiencing rashes: my doctors were all very cautious about the rashes. I had to step up the dose of the drug very slowly_ increasing 25mg at a time and staying at the new dose for at least a week and watching for symptoms.

Nothing has ever worked as well as Prozac did for 3 years -- it then stopped working regardless of dose adjustment/combinations. But this combo has been pretty good; definite mood stabilization/elevation_ and my thinking feels less scattered. Effexor on its own was never quite right. Unfortunately_ the side effects suck. I'd finally been clear of acne for a while -- breaking out again definitely correlated with going on Lamictal_ as did weight gain and PMS. The weight gain is minor. The joint pain_ which I didn't see listed anywhere as a side effect til coming here and seeing that others have experienced it_ freaks me out. I'm a writer/editor and type all day_ and was afraid I was getting early onset arthritis or something. I've been using arnica gel 3-4x daily_ which really helps. Pretty instant relief.

No highs or lows just middle of the road.However_ after a few weeks on 100mg I began to have side effects.I can't seem to tolerate the amount needed to effectively control my symptoms.

1670, 5, depression side of bi-polar,acne. I can't _guarantee_ the acne is related to the lamictal_ as I'd been under a bit of stress with the depression_ and it's remotely possible the acne was related to that - but I've never had acne in the past with stress and/or depression_ and the acne has continued where the depression hasn't and the stress has lessened (if not gone away).,I was miserable on depakote (fatigued_ miserable_ lifeless). I've been on Trileptal for a while and was doing great 'til I got depressed and that started getting bad_ so my dr. added lamictal_ low dose. I didn't expect much but had an effect within days. It was odd_ because I almost _wanted_ to be depressed. I thought I should be miserable_ but I just wasn't. The difference was dramatic and so very appreciated. I felt _normal__ and it was wonderful. Oh_ and it still is. It's only been 3 weeks_ but it's been all good despite situational life problems that would normally get me depressed.,F,35,3  weeks,6/8/2005,Lamictal

Lamictal has been a wonderful mood stabilizer for me.  My anxiety_ depression_ social anxiety all seem to be under control.  I am still skeptical because I am a rapid cycler and have been on numerous drugs with no long term relief.  Despite the side effects I am hoping this will work for me.

1675, 5, Depression,Night Sweats,After 20 years of depression and going through many SSRIs this medicine has really helped (in conjunction with parnate 30mg a day). The only side effect so far has been the night time sweating which began after uping the dose to 200mg a day. I found this site while searching for info. regarding this. I will be asking my doctor about it as if it continues the lack of sleep caused by the sweating may make it difficult to continue. Hopefully its temporary or I can lower the dose.,F,40,2  months,6/2/2005,Lamictal
1676, 1, seisures,I was in lawschool and decided to switch from Dilantin to Lamictal because my Doctor said that lamictal did not create the drowsiness associated with dilantin. The Doctor was dead wrong. I went off the medication after just 4 months because I was always sleepy and my brain ceased the ability to concentrate. I had to read the same sentence over and over again just to understand a single sentence_ but under Dilantin_ my reading comprehension was extremely high (I could read without re-reading sentences) as evidenced by my above average grades and high LSAT scores. My average dropped from a high B from previous semesters to a pathetic C-. Once a went back to Dilantin my cognitive function improved_ and I went back to making B's (which in lawschool is pretty good). Also_ Lamictal made me indifferent to the world around me_ not good if your competitive.,This medication might make your brain slow down and cause you to be indifferent to anything that happens to you. Do not use this medication_ especially if you think it will help your cognitive abilities and you are in a competitive academic field.,M,,4  months,6/2/2005,Lamictal

Increased dosage to 37.5mg_ congestion worse_ sleeping bad_ bad dreams_ headaches_ depression and intrusive thoughts constantly. Also I have noticed I can't spell sometimes_ and can't think of words that I used to use all the time.  Is it possible that I am now on too high a dosage?  I am seeing my doctor this week but have already gone back to taking 25mg.  I started taking it because I had been on Prozac for ten years and it wasn't working for me anymore_ also I was tierd of sexual side effects.

1682, 5, seizures and mild tbi,manic_ aggitated but I can think clearly now. some problems with lymph glands swelling and my tongue feeling fat with increased dosage at a fast rate so we had to increase the dosage at a very slow pace.,Since my head injury three and a half years ago_ I was left with partial_ tonic-clonic_ absence_ myoclonic and atonic seizures. I can not transfer short term memory into long term memory. And I could only handle one thing at a time without causeing a seizure. The lamictal has improved my thinking 90% but the side effect is my thoughts race and I can become very aggitated quickly. I sleeep four hours a day unless I take another medication to calm me down and help me to sleep. I have very few breakthrough seizures on the lamictal. They come from over doing it which is easy on the lamictal since the drugs makes me so hyper. I can process more information but I will still loose it if there is too much stimulation around me. Once we found out the lamictal was causeing me to have a personality change and I become aggitated so quickly (which can turn into a huge family fight). I can become very violent_ irrational and refuse to take medication once I am too manic on the drug. We have set up a every 2-4 hour check in where I can talk to a family member or friend and calm down or vent. Trileptal has been helpful with the mania and so has the clonapin. I can also ride the bus without seizures and go into a store to shop now. Just be careful if the check out lines are too long. hehe.,F,48,9  days,5/20/2005,Lamictal

1724, 5, Epilepsy,Slower thought processing_ slight memory loss_ bruise easily_ weight loss_ seizures during pregnancy.,This drug has been excellent in controlling my seizures with very little side effects compared to others I have taken such as Dilantin and Tegretal. The only time in 3 years that I have had a problem was when I had 4 seizures during the pregnancy (but probably due to changing blood levels and the need to increase medication more quickly). Also_ I have noticed that the medication has made me think a little slower and more irrationally. I'm not positive that this is due to the medication but I have slowly noticed that I feel like my thought process has been slower - ie- forgetting things_ not being able to find the right words when I talk_ unable to recall dates and names_ and overall just being slow to process information. I am usally a quick thinker_ great at trivia and speaking_ but since I have been on Lamictal I have a hard time with these things.,F,30,3  years,2/5/2005Email,Lamictal
