16, 4, Uti,"I was prescribed macrodantin after having numerous bladder i fections even after taking other antibotics I would still get bladder infection over and over. My urologist put me on macrodantin now being chronic as ive been on this for 8 months now (1 tablet at night) and i still have another 5months to go afterwhich i propably need to go for a followup. Obly side effects ive had is a bit of bloating and tiredness. But other than that it really works. I dont get bladder infections anymore. However reading all the conplaints i am a bit concerned about any side effects which eventually might surface because of the prolonged use of this medication. And maybe by then the side effects are irreversable. So yes the medication works for me but i am concerned for possible underlining side effects.

80, 3, UTI-unknown cause,I have noticed that I am extremely tired now and put it down to my lifestyle and the stress. I have increased my supplementation to gve me increased energy but noticed that it isn't increasing my energy levels as they used to. So_ I began to look at my eating habits which then pointed to the Macrodantin which I take at night. I read the sideffects and noted that legs felt weaker and had pain and that was me.,I felt that I was becoming lazy because I couldn't go out to bring in or hang up the washing. Everything was becoming a heavy chore and just to get up in the morning and get dressed and head into the day was a task. This just reinforced my sense of laziness of which that is not a character trait of mine. It has stopped the UTI's but I still suffer with the incontence of which no doctor has ever nbothered to investigate. I feel betrayed by the medical profession as I now have a huge monthly bill to pay for my incontinence pads. I just manage to get through all of this knowing that there are people far worse than me and I find ways to help others now.,F,57,60  days50mg 1X D,12/22/2011Email,Macrodantin
