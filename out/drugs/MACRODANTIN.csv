16, 4, Uti,"I was prescribed macrodantin after having numerous bladder i fections even after taking other antibotics I would still get bladder infection over and over. My urologist put me on macrodantin now being chronic as ive been on this for 8 months now (1 tablet at night) and i still have another 5months to go afterwhich i propably need to go for a followup. Obly side effects ive had is a bit of bloating and tiredness. But other than that it really works. I dont get bladder infections anymore. However reading all the conplaints i am a bit concerned about any side effects which eventually might surface because of the prolonged use of this medication. And maybe by then the side effects are irreversable. So yes the medication works for me but i am concerned for possible underlining side effects. But i havent had ""liver failure"" yet being on this for 8months already so i guess ill be fine.",,F,28,8  months100MG,5/12/2014Email,Macrodantin
