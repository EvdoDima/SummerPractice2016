0, 1, I was taking Keppra for my epilepsy,My skin has been peeling like a snake sheds it's skin my skin is coming of in chunks_ it has caused me to suffer with panick attacks and dizziness my mood has changed dramatically I'm very unstable with my mood and very snappy and aggressive and unbeatable to be around I have had a continuous headache which will not go away it's giving me a constant epileptic aura so makes it hard to understand if it is the onset of a seizure,I would NOT recommend this drug at all the side effects are by far much worse than any aura of a seizure or even the aftermath of a seizure it totally destroys your personality and has made me feel like I or others around me no longer know me,F,34,10  days250mg,7/8/2016Email,Keppra

5, 1, Grand mal seizure,I was put on 500mg of Keppra/Levetiracetam after suffering a Grand Mal in my sleep. The first week of taking this drug I felt like a zombie! I called my neurologist and he said that it will pass! Well_ halfway through week two and upping the dose to 1000mg a day it was like all of living hell had broken loose. I started experiencing nausea_ headaches_ diarrhea_ SEVERE ANXIETY AND PANIC ATTACKS along with depression_ burning skin and now insomnia! (Something which I've never had). I literally thought I was going crazy and going to die! By middle of week three I had to be weaned off of it. It has been five days now and I am still not feeling myself. I still have a weird spaced out feeling in my head (that comes and goes)_ burning skin and diarrhea. I wouldn't recommend taking the chance with this stuff.,Absolutely horrible drug. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,M,36,3  weeks500mg,3/22/2016,Keppra
6, 5, seizures,No side effects,I think and speak better than on topamax and dylantin. Got fired from a job while on Dylantin_ because I was too slow. Have no work issues on Keppra. I seem smarter on this medication.,F,59,4  years500 mg 2X D,3/4/2016,Keppra
7, 2, Grand mal seizures,Memory loss_ tired all the time_ no motivation_ loss of personality_ random dizziness. The main side affect I've noticed more than any is that I'm totally different on keppra.. I can't crack jokes_ I don't understand easy tasks sometimes_ can't multitask at all_ tired when awake_ awake when I go to bed.,It doesn't really stop seizures until you get up to the right dose_ which took me about 4 months_ if I have another seizure I up my dose again. If you're lively in your friendship group_ you won't be after keppra.,M,19,6  months2000mg,1/28/2016,Keppra
8, 1, Left Frontal Temporal Lobe Seizures,I have been on 500mg twice a day and I hate this drug!! I have more anxiety than ever_ eye pain and twitching eye_ feels like my head will explode. I don't ever feel like leaving my home or doing anything! I've never been so depressed in my life! It makes me want to check myself in mental institution. Not to mention always off balance and lite headed plus raises my blood pressure.,I somehow want off this drug. I just spoke to my doctor and I will be switched to Trileptal and be weaned off of Keppra by taking only 250mg twice a day for a week. I'm a bit scared taking the 2 drugs together for a week_ but will be glad to get away from this nasty Keppra,F,58,2  years1000 MG,12/21/2015Email,Keppra
9, 1, Epilepsy,Dizziness_ Confusion_ days at a time of severe anxiety. Nausea and vomiting the first week and sometimes now.,I'm taking myself off of this medication today. I've been on it for 4 weeks_ and have only had a few days of full clarity. I'm fuzzy_ anxious_ and angry. I cry easily. I've had 3 seizures since I've been on it... one of them today. I have grand mal seizures_ have for 12 years. Was unmedicated for a long time because medications kept failing. Now seeing a neurologist_found a brain lesion (unknown what it is or why it's there) which is likely the source in rt temporal lobe. I can't even get back in to see the neurologist for 3 more weeks (his schedule!!) and I can't do this medication that long. I'd rather have seizures than be this miserable all of the time. I normally have auras to warn me before a seizure. Now I always feel like I might have one_ because these side effects are so similar to pre-seizure.,M,30,4  weeks250mg,11/20/2015Email,Keppra
10, 3, epilepsy,I didn't relate these problems with the keppra until I read the side effects. I used to have grand mal seizures daily or weekly. Dilation didn't help at all. Keppra stopped the grand mal down to maybe one a month but I shake and twitch non stop and have terrible anxiety_ depression and paranoia now. Always picking my skin and face. Head and neck pains daily. I get dizzy a lot and have trouble breathing and get panic attacks about the tiniest things.I don't trust anyone and am very confused and forgetful. The main problem is the anxiety and depression. And panicked feeling. Maybe I should switch meds. I've never had acne before but now I'm so anxious all the time it's all I can do to not scream always picking at my face and smoking too many cigarettes.,The anxiety is unbareable. I don't want to be around people_ but don't want to be alone. It's weird. I have trouble holding conversations and am snapping and angry on this stuff is there a mood elevator you can take with keppra that can counteract the depression and anxiety? Also I over analyze every single thing and never say what I think anymore because I fear my thoughts are too negative. I need help or something..,F,26,3  years2000 mg,11/19/2015Email,Keppra

Although was Dx'd with MS in '05_ these we're my first seizures. This is the worst drug! I was switched to Vimpat_ which still had horrible side effects. I have concerns now that these medications caused permanent damage (anxiety_ forgetfulness_ increased/worsened ADHD symptoms_ memory loss).,F,45,3  days 1X D,10/25/2015Email,Keppra
13, 1, Epilepsy,Severe mood swings!,My mother had her first (and only seizure to my knowledge) 3 days ago and turned blue. After 2 nights in the hospital_ they sent her home on this drug and has not been the same since. When someone used to say Kep-Rage_ I'd sympathize_ but never knew the extent of what they were describing. My mom_ generally a positive and humorous person_ has been a completely different person since coming home on the drug. She is screaming at my father and I for little reason and staring off into space the next moment. I'm not saying this drug is bad for everyone_ but please make sure you're with the person taking it for the first few days to ensure it is not causing an adverse effect. The Neurologist said that on older people_ ESPECIALLY_ it can cause very poor effects. I'm hoping she returns back to her old self.,F,69,2  days,10/20/2015Email,Keppra

20, 1, Brain surgery,My husband was on Keppra last year w/brain surgery@500mg twice a day. He was excessively tired & weak the few weeks he was on it. He had chills_ a dry mouth_ loss of appetite_and sad. We just thought it was the surgery and didn't think anymore of it. Then he was diagnosed with subderal hematomas which had been missed on MRI's and he went in for surgery again. However_ this time they put him on 2000mg per day & I noticed rapid changes_ that the docs dismissed_ such as again_ the dry mouth_ he said his nose was stuffy_ both eyes were red & he kept rubbing his eyes_ he got more tired & weak each day_ he kept saying he was chilled_ his personality started to change_ he would get irritable & sad_ which is totally unlike him & he kept telling everyone he didn't feel like himself. His gums started to bleed. The docs said_ well he's on heparin. I told them he was before & his gums did not bleed. Then his lips got red & swollen & blisters on his lips & in his mouth_ he kept saying his back was itchy & would not stop scratching. He had loss of appetite_ which even a nurse said wasn't like him since he's on steroids & always makes him hungry. I kept saying I thought he was on too much Keppra. Then one day they were walking him in the hallway and his left side went limp_ he wasn't able to talk without slurred speech_ the left side of his face dropped by the corner of his mouth & they thought he had a stroke or seizure. His memory was fa,They called a resident who decided to increase the Keppra to the maximum dose of 3000mg per day. No one listened to me that it was the Keppra. Then he got worse with his legs jerking as he slept. He got so tired he couldn't keep his eyes open for more than a second. He became hoarse when talking_ not only chilled_ but was shaking_ joint pain in wrist_ more depressed_ blisters across his cheeks. I mentioned again to the surgeon I thought it was the Keppra & showed how his skin was peeling all over (exfoliative dermatitis) & red bumps. Another physician & RN agreed w/me_ so the surgeon said another MRI & CT Scan to be sure_ which were clear. The blood work on Keppra came back more than double normal. They decreased the Keppra2000mg in 48 hours & slowly tapered the rest. Even w/him on only 250mg per day_ he had aggression_ weakness& excessive tiredness. His stomach hurt& he was nauseas& bloated& sneezing & continued chills_ they thought he had a cold_ he remained in a fog. He had difficulty urinating from the beginning. He's been off Keppra 3 days now_ still confusion_ memory problems & very tired. He was more clear headed right after surgery_ than after the Keppra was increased. We're hoping he does not have permanent damage. All from being on Keppra only 18 days!,M,62,2  weeks1000mg per,4/26/2015,Keppra

22, 5, Epilepsy,Im way different. I feel like i have changed a lot. I got in touch with my feelings_ something that i never dealt with_ and didnt care to deal with_ before the Keppra medication. Also_ i get angry really fast but im trying not to show it to people because i know that there is no point in fighting over things that i would normally wouldnt. Moreover_ i feel like it takes my energy away from me. I feel that im not me anymore_ which makes me unhappy and just want to cry over the great personality i've lost due to the pills. Also_ i suffer from migraines from time to time and blurred vision.,I also feel that im over-analyzing things and situations in my head. I also experienced mood swings. (i went from extremely angry to super happy in less than 3 minutes two days ago...which is not good...it confuses people!) I take my pills at 8 o'clock in the morning and 8 o'clock at night. Even if i dont know what time it is or i didnt set an alarm o'clock my body (?) feels that its time to take the pill and it usually is 7:50 or 7:55 o'clock (scary)...,F,21,1  years500MG 2X D,4/18/2015Email,Keppra

27, 1, Seizure,,I started on Keppra / Levetiracetam in late 2009 after having 2 seizures the latter I broke my arm. Both occasions I was taken to hospital with no recollection of anything for several hours_ both seizures happened whilst I was sleeping. After many tests including CT and MRI scans_ nothing was found. Soon after I was put on Keppra / Levetiracetam and things seemed ok to start with but not for long my moods were up and down_ forgetful_ depressed and so on_ I hadn't been allowed to drive for a year. With the thought of everything going on in my head_ the possibility of not being able to drive I just kept how I was feeling to myself_ It was like a ticking time bomb. After almost three years like this I spoke to my doctor_ unfortunately I didn't tell him everything just skimming over the surface (I was scared) he put it down to stress and put me on 60mg Duloxotine daily_ I was on this for 2 years_ this didn't help and made my head feel quite fuzzy_ when asked by the doc how I was feeling I just said I was ok even though I wasn't. I am a wreck at the moment. A friend had me make an appointment with the doc this week and also came with me to my appointment_ I was in a position there I had to tel the doc everything. I don't know if the issues I have are related to the medication but I wasn't like this until I started taking it. Hoping for some improvements. If you are suffering from what you believe could be side effects from your medication tell your doctor.,M,49,5  years500mg 2X D,1/23/2015EmailHistory,Keppra

We both got the feeling from the Doc that he won't start weaning him off the Keppra until he sees him on Feb 9th.  We CANNOT live this way_ he is a clear concise person and we are both at our wits end.  He was put on Keppra because he had a really big seizure one afternoon_ no history of this before.  But he had no water that day_ taken other meds_ not eaten etc and we feel this more likely caused this seizure.  The docs answer was_ it would just be better to take these drugs the rest of your life and not have to worry about it WHAT?  Really?  The EEG was done in the doctor's office_ if not performed right it can show all kinds of things.  We asked about re-testing and was told we could do that in a year_ but again just easier to stay on drugs.  Can anyone give us a clear step by step method of weaning off  Keppra?  He takes 500 mg's AM & PM_ so that he can start to see results_  we will call the doc too_ but do not think we will get a reply and need help now that he that he has been on the Dilantin to get off Keppra.  We will also be seeking a second opinion and an EEG performed at the hospital next time_ he did have an MRI done as well and it was normal.  I simply do not understand why the doc would not be more interested in seeing him off of this_ other than a very obvious one.,M,66,75  days1000 2X D,1/18/2015Email,Keppra
29, 1, Stress induced/non specific seizure,Kepp-Rage. Complete Sedation. Anxiety.,I developed this seizure disorder after my divorce at age 37. Absolutely horrible medication. When I returned to my doctor_ rather than inform me that the rage/irritability was due to keppra_ I was given a refill of an anti depressant I'd not needed in over a year. (I have PTSD_ anxiety disorder and depression from a serious accident that I am trying to control without meds.) A pharmacy student enlightened me as to rage being the chief complaint of keppra users. It took exactly 7 hours for me to turn into a complete monster. My better half simply breathing made me want to tear his head off. A regular customer of mine lost her father due to the side effects of Keppra. His fits of rage put him in a care facility_ where he died 16 hours later of a stress related massive coronary.

Only seizing once every 15-20 days for a ten min clonic tonic. This i would recommend. We have tried clobazam phenytoin etc but this is the best mix,,F,5,5  years600mg bd,1/6/2014,Keppra

Some dizziness each time I've increased the dose but my body has adjusted to it within a few weeks.  Was so worried about taking it after reading horrific reviews but after joining an Epilepsy forum several members reassured me they were OK.  I lost the weight I'd gained from taking SV within 2 weeks_ could eat normally again.  Now side effects have worn off I feel more energetic_ mind clearer (this is why I think done people feel more angry as previous meds have dulled down emotions & it's getting used to it again). Still having vivid dreams but research shows this goes from 55% reporting it in the first 6 months to 5% after that...I'll live in hope!

55, 4, cancerous brain tumor w/resection,Lethargy_ mood swings_ memory problems_ occasional balance problems_ fits of crying_ occasional fits of inappropriate rage_ possible loss of appetite.,I started on 500 mg of Keppra 2X daily.  After my craniotomy and tumor resection 3 -1/2 months ago_ I had to increase my dosage several times due to breakthrough seizure activity.  With each dosage increase_ side effects returned and then gradually faded.  I've been at the 2000 mg 2X daily for over a month now with no breakthrough seizures.  I do still sometimes experience the side effects_ but it is difficult to say how much of the balance and tiredness are from the surgery and how much from the medication.  The most disruptive side effect is probably the crying and rage episodes_ which do happen less than they did after the last dosage increase.  I've had less appetite at each dosage level and have not experienced any weight gain or infections_ or inappropriate behavior of any kind other than the mood swings and rages.,F,41,5  months2000 2X D,10/24/2013Email,Keppra
56, 3, prescribed for one seisure episode,some sight nausea not regularly_ vivid active dreaming_ tiredness (maybe from the dreams?),I had what was described as an epileptic seizure about a month ago. I spent 4 days in the hospital going through a barrage of tests ie. mri_  ecg etc. The doctor was initially at a loss of what had happened and accused me of being an alcoholic that had caused me to fall out of bed while biting my tongue_ foaming at the mouth and eyes rolling up while making a high pitched noise (according to my wife). I told her I drank at most a couple of beers at suppertime. I then mentioned I had been having what I describe as deja vu/ anxiety spells for several years that can occur sporadically or frequently and tend to make me physically ill when they happen. I was put on levetiracetam 250 mg 2. x a day plus a multi- vitamin mineral pill plus my usual amilodopine for HBP. I was to go to 500 mg 2 x daily two weeks ago but have decided to stay on the lower dosage. I don't like the suggested side effects mentioned on these higher doses. I have had no seizures or the mentioned spells since. The doctor said that one can have a seizure and then never have another again. I am suspicious of pharmaceutical companies motives beyond profit to promote some of the toxic things they do. And a lot of doctors are right along with them since they get a $ kickback for doing so.Seems to me the cure is worse than the disease sometimes.,M,58,30  days250 2X D,9/10/2013,Keppra

58, 1, Epilepsy,This drug is a nightmare! In April last year I was taking 2250mg and felt like I was going crazy. I was angry about everything_ utterly depressed_ exhausted_ but unable to sleep and hostile towards friends and family. I had repeated UTIs and kidney infections that left me allergic to 4 types of anti-biotics. I gained 40lbs despite eating less_ I screamed in my dad's face as though I was possessed and often thought of ending it all. Eventually I realised that it was the Keppra and told my Specialist Nurse that I wasn't taking it anymore and she agreed to me going back to Lamictal with some Keppra as a top up.I am now on 300mg Lamictal and reduced the Keppra down to 750mg - 500mg is the goal. I feel so much better; no more infections_ insomnia improving with every reduction and weight coming down. Everyone has commented on how I am like my 'old self'. I have my energy back and am able to swim_ do pilates and go for walks again. I am enjoying all the things I was doing 3 years ago; seeing friends_ movies_ theatre_ laughing!! Life seems worth living again.I had been seizure free (from 'grand mals') for 6 years and then_ on Keppra_ had 4 in 5 hours; the worst ever in 20 years. This drug brought my life to standstill. In fact_ it put it in reverse. I would sooner live my life and risk a seizure_ than be seizure free and merely existing in a room wishing I was dead.,,F,39,3  years750mg,8/4/2013,Keppra

I was going off it then my Lamictal bad side effects came back_ so my neuro agreed to leave me on Keppra. 500mg_ morning & night. Make sure your pharmacy doesn't switch manufacturers_ however... it affected me differently with another company's generic brand. I take the generic_ levetiracetam_ made by CAMBER.

Originally given 2-weeks worth of samples of the XR-version_ then switched to the immediate release; told to take it twice a day (1000mg tabs).  Made me very agitated_ and after about 3 weeks after taking it I felt like the world around me was moving in slow motion;  I didn't want to be bugged and it felt like just getting off the couch was an agony.  And when I ran out of samples of XR and got my script filled for the non-XR_ gave me mild anxiety attacks.

I still took keppra not realising it was this causing the anxiety_ just after going on keppra i'd met someone and we later moved in together. They stood by me throughout all of this but in the end my thoughts were so distorted that i blamed them for all the things i was feeling_ when they left i felt nothing_ after 5 1/2 years i felt NOTHING_ not until i started to have a breakdown and decided it was the keppra did i feel anything_ months after they left i went through the process of them leaving me(me breaking us up).

I thought it was my diet but it isnt. Keppra WILL cause acne. Most people (including me) feel weak and unable/unmotivated to do things. It's hard enough to even leave my bed after Ive gotten 10+ hours of sleep. I just want to stay in bed and veg out all the TIME!!,Keppra on one note is helpful. It is EXTREMELY good for you in the sense that it is totally filtered through your body and digested. It is not stored_ absorbed or residual medication left behind in your system. This was a breakthrough for seizure medication because it had little to NO harm on your body. No liver or kidney issues. Its great. But the side affects of this medication (AED) really mess up a SOCIAL and UP BEAT persons life big time. If you work in a cubical_ hate your life and or job and arent married or have children... then this medication is for you. If you like to laugh_ be physically active_ play sports_ be sexual and romantic_ have a loving and caring relationship or have a life then Keppra is NOT for you. Keppra_ although_ did stop my seizures and at a VERY low dosage of only half a pill (250 MG) a day.

Increased aggitation seems to have accurred for me for a breif amount of time every time i have had a sizeable seizure weather i have been on meds or not. And Insomnia was a previous issue i had that seems to provoke my seizures and increase the severity. I also had terrible migraines in the begging but im pretty sure that was related to my siezures as they went away completley when my dose was raised.,I would like to add that i noticed many ppl that rated this drug when they listed side effects listed things that may be a result of the seizure not being controlled by the med or dose or both and not the med itself causing it.  Not saying that thats the case for everyone but i know for me some of my symptoms it turned out to be that my dose was not high enough to control my seizures as my agression and migraines completely went away with my new dose.

90, 1, Epilepsy,I took this 11 years ago so I don't remember what the dosage was_ only that it was increased each month.  The first month_ not much as far as side effects_ and certainly no help.  Second month at a higher dosage_ still no help but gained 5 pounds.  Third month and a higher dosage_ smidge of help and gained 10 pounds.  Fourth month there wasn't much more help_ but I gained FOURTY POUNDS!!!  The thing was_ it also took my appetite from me so I wasn't eating at all.  I got pregnant_ went off the medication_ and the pregnancy seems to be what stopped the seizures for a while.,The one good thing it did was to muck about with my hormones and put them back where they were before I had gone on birth control when I first got married.  It made it possible for me to get pregnant by shortening the length of my cycle from 14-16 days down to 10.  Other than that...nothing.,F,38,4  months 2X D,11/28/2010Email,Keppra

I felt it was worth it to continue.,About 1 year ago_ I started to get some mouth problems. At first it was a metalic taste and dry feeling_ but also a lot of saliva. This got worse and worse over time. I asked for help from everyone. Doctor_ dentist_ neuro_ hygenist. They all said my mouth looked normal_ but one said she could refer me to a dermatologist. I lived with it_ then 10 days ago I got a rash. The neuro switched me to lamictal. All was fine for first three days. I felt better than I had in 2.5 years. Then I increased dose  to 50mg2x/day and had two seizures. Then I when the dose was to 75mg2x/day_ I got the same mouth problem as with the keppra_ but 10x worse.

97, 2, Partial complex seizures,Major insomnia - was getting maybe 4 hrs sleep per night_ even when taking sleep aids.  Other effects were significant irritability_ depression_ SUICIDAL THOUGHTS (have never had those before - very strange...seemed like a reasonable course of action)_ fatigue_ jittery_ lack of energy_ lack of mental focus.  Dizzyness - was diagnosed with BPPV_ a form of vertigo - not sure if Keppra caused it_ but it diminished as soon as I stopped.  Some weight gain.  Not sure how many of those symptoms were a direct effect from the drug or the insomnia.,Despite the side effects_ it was effective in controlling my seizures.  I ramped down off of Keppra and within days had multiple seizures.  I have now switched to Depakote but haven't taken it long enough to judge.

Speech became VERY slow_ then could not move arms.  Tears for no reason(I mean HYSTERICAL!) Apologized all over for everything.  Started making odd noises and could not stop.  Started shaking all over.  They took me to the ER and I became very tired.  They kept hollering at me to keep my eyes open and talk to them. Might get exceptionally quiet/softspoken.  Doctors believed these were side effects of Keppra_ not seizures.  They tried reducing the dose fom 1500 mg/day to 1000.  The next day I was in the ER again for the same symptoms_ but also noticed my upper back ardhed backward.  After 3 trips to ER_ they took me off  & switched me to another drug which,I didn't have much luck.  I did notice that someone said the generic can hit you differently than the brand name drug.

100, 3, partial complex epilepsy of the tem,When I first started taking Keppra_ I recall having dry mouth symptoms. Later_ I started detecting an allergic reaction to what might have been the fillers used in Keppra.  I complained to the drug manufacturer a few times.  Whether it was the quality control department or the pharmacies that got down to the problem I don't know but I stopped getting sinus inflammation or an upset stomach.  When this was going on it wasn't every time I got a prescription refill that I had those symtpoms. It was happening every now and then. I was told that the fillers used in Keppra were not always the same ones. The problem got fixed along the way and this was the brand Keppra not the generic.Recently_ I am now on the generic but I have to give it time.  It seems that I might be having a reaction to my amalgam-silver fillings and a gold crown molar tooth.  I have dental expenses to take care of before saying it is a side-effect of the generic brand.  I plan on removing amalgam fillings and getting,When I first started taking keppra_ I had a sharper focus on studying.  Additionally_ I felt more alert and energetic. Over the years_ the heightened energy wore off.  I continued to take Keppra because it helps me feel more balanced.  Additionally_ it does not cause fatigue or sleepiness like other anti-convulsants.  I do not want to take a supplement with Keppra because I don't want to encounter adverse side effects from other meds that could have more serious consequences.  Keppra is regarded as to be low risk for kidney problems.  I experienced no aggressive behavior on this drug.As for seizures_ I was told at the beginning keppra alone is not going to stop seizures. I was diagnosed with an underlying seizure of the temporal lobe of the brain at that time. Additionally_ I was diagnosed positive for meniere's disease before I started keppra. I had several meniere's episode before taking keppra. Later I was told that in my case meniere's episodes were likely to be part of the epilepsy condition rather than an independent disorder.  I agree with this because I get over the meniere's episodes in a shorter time than people with true meniere's disease.I continued keppra because it made me feel balanced. Over timeseizures which only happened in my sleep became more graphic but the frequency of seizures was the same (occasional). No pattern was evident and I do not relate this to keppra because the causation is the environment.  Keppra did not increase frequency of seizur,F,57,8  years,11/5/2009,Keppra

I failed Dilantin (aggression)_ Neurontin (made seizures worse)_ Tegretol (ineffectiveness after 5 years despite increase in dosage along with interactions with other new meds I had to take) and Topamax (I flipped out on this after the first_ lowest dose. 6 hour panic attack). My neurologist was initially hesitant to put me on this because I did fit the general profile of those who tend to be affected by the aggression side effects of Keppra... but this has never happened to me. I no longer have to deal with the brain fog side effects common to anticonvulsants_ and that alone makes this one a dream.

Gradually_ attacks/symptoms increased until it scrambled his brain and he had to be admitted to a hospital.  Keppra was stopped and the attacks of aphasia ended within 12 hours.  His ability to speak has mostly returned_ but he's confused and child-like.  Will he ever fully come back from what this drug did to him? --Written as of his 4th day off Keppra.,M,66,20  days,6/11/2005,Keppra
150, 4, epilepsy,At first it was like a truth serum. I was amazed at what came out of my mouth - all the thoughts I was truly thinking! AGh!And some were violent thoughts....until my doctor put me on Zoloft. Although I've gained 15 pounds_ after 14 years I can finally use my left brain and do math calculations. After zoloft_ I've calmed down and more myself than ever! The worst side effect is insomnia. I take calcium Magnesium for that. It works.I also have migraines once in awhile (never have before!). But_ this is the best anti-seizure drug so far. I can finally think and produce.,I had to cut down to 1 pill keppra at night and 1/2 pill in the morn. Also 1/2 pill zoloft. I hate medication_ but now I have no seizures for the first time. Only caffeine triggers them.,F,60,8  months,2/15/2005,Keppra
