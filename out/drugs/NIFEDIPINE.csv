3, 3, Raynaud's syndrome,dizziness_ severe headaches,1st script from Walgreens was a harder pill & side effects were manageable.  Refill from Rite Aid was a softer pill which I had to stop taking after a week of a constant headache and being unable to walk immediately after taking it due to the dizziness.  It does work incredibly well to relieve swelling of the extremities.,F,40,45  days10 MG 2X D,5/4/2013Email,Nifedipine
4, 4, Hypertension,Shaking_ dizziness_ nausea_ sometimes extreme fatigue_ constipation.,I was prescribed this for pregnancy-induced hypertension that didn't resolve itself after delivery and has since become permanent. At first_ my hands would shake so bad I couldn't hold on to anything. This_ fortunately_ has subsided and only happens once in a great while if I don't eat after taking it. I still get dizzy if I get up quickly or move around too fast suddenly. The constipation is awful_ but I've made it significantly less by taking fiber every day. The fatigue sometimes_ however_ can be a nuisance. On the positive side_ it has lowered my blood pressure significantly_ and I'm still on a small dose (10mg 2x/day).,F,34,4  years,4/28/2009,Nifedipine
