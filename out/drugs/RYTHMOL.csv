0, 5, Afib,I had the common metallic taste for about six months.  I've been on it four years this month_ and it has completely controlled my episodes of Afib.

1, 1, A-fib,Converted to sinus rhythm_ but cardiologist wanted to experiment with Rythmol as pill-in-a-pocket rescue drug. Almost immediately after taking_ heart rate skyrocketed and felt like it was pushing me back into afib. Side effects lasted for about a month from that single dose. Will never again try any Class III antiarrhythmic.,Judging from online comments_ doesn't seem to work very reliably. Probably best to avoid.,M,51,1  days150mg,4/28/2016,Rythmol

10, 1, Intermittent A-Fib,Severe (near debilitating) muscle cramps in shoulders_ groin_ upper thigh.  So severe that Tylenol and Naproxen did not help much.  This began within a day of taking the medication.Cardiologist thought it may have been one of the other meds causing the issue and changed them.   At day 23 I could no longer take the pain and wouldn't take it anymore.  At day 24_ the cardiologist agreed to take me off it.  It's been near three weeks and the remnants of the pains still shoot through my shoulders.   However_ I can now move my arms without a huge amount of pain.  It slowly is all coming back.,I'm sure Rythmol works for some folks but for me_ the severe muscle cramps was too much.,M,45,24  days325 1X D,4/23/2015Email,Rythmol
11, 3, Diagonised with SVT/ afib,Weakness_ blurred vision _ acid reflux _ stomach burning _ swears_ a little bit of chest pain. ( but pretty sure this was all part of the healing process),I have been on rhythmol for two weeks now following a catheter ablation done by my electrophysiologist .. He prescribed me rythmol 350 mg 2x daily along with 25 mg of toporal (beta blocker ) after coming home from the hospital I was having bad side effects (stomach acid_ dizzy_ confusion_ blurred vision_ weak _ I felt awful all over ) I could not tell if these were side effects from the drugs or from the healing process of the surgery ...  After  about 6 days I skipped a day of Meds to see if the side effects would subside .... By noon that day I was feeling worst than ever so took them again and right away felt better about an hour after .  So that answered my question. I haven't hd any episodes of a high heart rate.. I am scheduled for another ablation in 6 weeks but hopefully the rythmol will keep working for me until then.,F,23,2  weeks350mg,3/16/2015,Rythmol

I have had an implantable cardiac monitor (Medtronic LINQ) inserted into my chest and hope that the doc can finally get some solid data from this gadget and a better diagnosis instead of doing the 'best guesses' with these damn pills.

Had a bad episode on Christmas of last year when I caught the flu and the doc gave me a cough med that had a bad reaction with the atenolol. Causing my heart to bounce between 145 to 185 bpm.  Ended up in the hospital for a couple of days.  The doctor wanted to do an ablation but now they say the success rate isn't good enough.  Think I'm going to get a second opinion.

But overall the medicine works great for me I can deal with the minor side effects because it's so much better than dealing with the Afib..

Had an occular migraine day #3 (no pain_ just swirling lights and colors in left eye) and wonky little pains in head.   high pitched ringing in ears.  Appetite decrease_ initally constipated_ but that resolved with adding more fiber foods to diet.  GERD/mild burpy condition_ especially on rising_ taking medicine for that.,Praying I will not be taking this long; 12 days ago_ just had my 2nd ablation and placed on this for support during post ablation healing period.  This is my 5th AFIB drug in the two yrs I've had it (lone AFIB type). Either my second (touch-up) ablation has worked (praying so) or this meicine is working in conjunction_ because I have had no bad AFIB eipsodes since ablation...:)  I have been on 5 meds and all caused side effects_ I am really sensitive to these meds (beta blockers and this class too)...+ didnt eliminate my lone AFIB. therefore ablations. About my recent burpy GERD_ which I never experienced  before these meds_ (I dont eat a diet to cause this)  I have seen GI dr and told developing GERD can come from channel blockers and other  rhythm meds.  keep the faith everyone.  report whats not working for you to your Cardio EP.  stay after it.  AFIB and meds to treat it have many possible side effects...which can really bring you down.  aside from AFIB I am in great health..best wishes to all.,F,45,11  days225 2X D,8/12/2011Email,Rythmol

31, 4, arrythmia & palpatations,Last year my heart started fluttering and having palpatations. There were no other symptoms. I went to the er and they sent me home.  I saw a cardiologist and he put me on Rythmol 225 2 x a day and Metoprolol er 50 mg 1 x a day. At first I was tired and had no energy.  After about 2 weeks I started to feel better with no other side effects.  My doctor suggested that I get the ablation so I could be free of any meds_ so I tried that. The procedure was not painful at all_ but the doctor couldn't get my heart to mess up at all_ so he ended the procedure. That was last September and I have had 2 small episodes of palpations since. My EP doctor said I might try to reduce my dosage to one a day_ but I'm afraid the palpations and arrythmia will come back.  Overall I think the Rythmol has helped me. I do everything I use to except drink coffee_tea_ and eat chocolate.I can live with that. They really need to lower the price for people that can't afford it.,,F,62,1  years225 2X D,2/8/2011,Rythmol

I am not real happy with my cardioligist as he just wants me to try the ""newest"" pill and my GP really doesn't understand the connection of my symptoms. I am fortunate to live in an area with many choices ofteaching institutions_ and recently found out about a world renowned EP cardioligist close by. I have talked to his successes with Pulmonary Vein Ablation and have an appointment in a week for a second opinion.

Had maybe 4 palapatations (4 or less beats) in the las 10 months. I think your hair grows slower_ but that just means less haircuts. No loss of ability to exercise.

36, 4, Cardiac Ablation,Originally took Multaq twice a day during my post-ablation recovery to control afibs until scar tissue formed.  It worked_ but only for a few hours - never reached 12 hours before next dose was due and this was frustrating.  Then the EP put me on Rythmol 325mg X 2 a day_ and it controlled my afibs for the full 12 hours each dose.  Now_ I am getting very small afibs again after a month post-ablation and they are getting more frequent in nature.  The EP told me to continue my cardio exercise_ but the Rythmol makes me yawn constantly as I am not pumping enough blood with oxygen with this slower heart rate.,I had an uncontrolled afib episode that finally sent me to the hospital.  It was finally controlled by an IV drug - Cardizam(?)_ but once off the drip_ the afib would return.  Had a cardiac ablation to remedy this afib.  It worked for a month_ now the afibs are back_ not as strong or long lasting_ but getting more frequent each day.

Had a cardioversion 8 months ago. My heart stayed steady for 7 months before the AFib returned. My cardiologist put me on Rythmol (225 mg twice a day). Before taking the drug the only effect I felt from the AFib was slight shortness of breath when I began exercising. After a couple of minutes of exercise the shortness of breath disappeared. I called the doctor's office today and was told to discontinue taking Rythmol and return to taking digoxin.

I wish I was one of those who didn't feel them.  I would pay at least $72 to not feel them anymore.  Thought about ablasion_ but the word actually means to destroy_ so I think I will think on it.

49, 2, AF,Who knows.  When you have afib you feel weak_ dizzy_ out of breath_ have palpitations and anxiety because your heart beats are irregular.  Had AF about 4-8 hours almost every day with some episodes lasting 18-24 hours.  The side effects of the drug were minimal compared to the effects of the AF.,"Had pulmonary vein catheter ablation 3 months ago.  Marked reduction in paroxymal AF immediately.  No AF after two weeks  Still taking the drug along with diltiazem.  Should be able to stop all the drugs in a couple of weeks.  Protocol calls for continuing the drugs and wsrfarin for 3 months post ablation.   All of these posts I read about drugs causing problems seem actually to be the AF causing problems.  Work with your Dr. and find a combination of drugs that relieves the AF.  If that doesn't work look into ablation.  The procedure is pretty successful (80%?) for lone paroxymal AF.  The longer you have AF the harder it is to get rid of.  Once it is chronic and you are ""older"" it is tough to get rid of the AF.  However I will be glad to get off the heart meds.

He then added Cardizem 150mg later in case I have another a-fib episode...it's suppposed to slow my heart rate.  I haven't had one a-fib episode since being on Rythmol.  I hope it lasts.

I was extremely lethargic_ cold with chills and had low blood pressure (95/70). I couldn't function and just sat around watching TV until the drug wore off.  It did control my AVs which are intermittent and of short duration.  However_ the side effects are not worth it.  The only good part was that it increased my libido with a bunch of very vivid sexual dreams. I am starting to wonder if my insulin resistance makes me ultra sensitive to beta blockers.

This would allow the heart to get back to normal after 1 - 3 hours of rest. Some comments talk of Rythmol being better than the generic propafenone (whats the difference?)Lately I have been experiencing regular extra and skipped beats that are not going away. Will talk to my doc about uping the dose or switching to rythmol. Has worked for me up to now but I fell that something has changed in the last 4 weeks. Maybe I have abad batch of pill????

74, 3, Atrial Flutter & Atrail Fibrillatio,This is one of the toughest drugs I have ever experienced_ both 325mg and 225mg_ although it does work.  I am a very active man with a very active life.  My blood pressure is excellent and my normal heart rate is 72 beats per minute.  I take no daily drugs.  I initially came down with a surprise atrial fibrillation (160 to 180 beats per min) with each event lasting anywhere from an hour and a half to two hours.Several weeks later I came down with atrial flutter_ approximately 120 beats per minute.  I could not convert from the flutter and ended up in the hospital with Rythmol SA as the I.V. treatment drug of choice.  There is a high risk of stroke if you let these conditions last too long.  After 24 hours_ it took a electrical shock to bring me out of the flutter event.  Rythmol 325mg twice a day was the drug of choice after the event.  Prior to the event_ Rythmol SA 225mg was the doze of choice by the doctors.  The 225mg was not strong enough to control my problems.With th,"I elected to have catheter ablation two weeks ago.  With a good_ qualified surgeon_ there is nothing to the procedure.  After the procedure_ the specialist put me on Rythmol SA 325mg for three weeks for healing.  After a week_ I called the doctor and he suggested that I stop the drug_ which I did.  Within 36 hours I had a heart event with wildly changing rates.I call the doctor_ and he said ""just go back on the Rythmol 325mg"" which I did_ and in less than 20 minutes the event was over.  I found out later that the heart takes two weeks to heal after a catheter ablation.  The surgeon had initially suggested I take the drug for three weeks during the healing process.The doctor suggested I reduce the twice a day doze from 325mg to 225mg because I was once again unable to function.

103, 3, arrythmia (re entry tachy_ IST),swelling in feet_ irregular feeling heart beat_ difficulty breathing when walking_ dizziness,So far it has really helped to control my heart rate_ my resting used to be around 120 bpm now its at about 90_ so it definitely feels a lot better.  I live a pretty active lifestyle so the dizziness has become a little bothersome.  Im a little worried about the side effects (new irregular heart rhythm) I also take cardizem LA 240 mgs for my HBP.  When I was 20 I was prescribed Toprol xl 100 mgs which made me tired and fat.  I also was given Flecainide a couple months ago and disontinued using it b/c of the possible toxic effects... I feel the rythmol is working much better for me then the Flec.  Overall it works well and I'm feeling better then I did before the taking it.,F,24,6  days,6/24/2007Email,Rythmol
104, 2, SVTs_ PVCs arrhythmia,The only side effect for me appears to be tiredness and muscle fatigue.  But_ I had no other effects and didn't have any bitter taste in mouth.,Also_ unfortunately didn't do a thing for my arrhythmia.  So_ still searching...,F,42,3  weeks,6/16/2007Email,Rythmol
105, 4, atrial fib,Took 150mg. 3x a day for over 12 yrs._ then experienced a relapse of atrial fib.  Dr. increased my dosage to 225mg. 3x a day and it worked_ however_ now I have had shortness of breath and tightness in my chest.  All I want to do is sleep.  Not unusual for me to sleep 10 hrs. at night_ get up for a couple  hrs. and be back in bed again due to fatigue.  This goes on all day.  No quality of life.  My heart rate is 46-47 BPM an skips beats regularly.,Rythmol was a life saver for me in the beginning_ but I'm not so sure right now.  Maybe I should be switched to the Rythmol SR instead of generic propafenone.  I'm tired of being tired.,M,63,13  years,6/9/2007Email,Rythmol
106, 2, Atrial Fibrillation,Short of breath_ blurred vision_ increased joint pain_ fatigue,I just felt terrible while taking rythmol_ but I noticed in the other comments that the younger folks had great results. Maybe age has something to do with effectiveness of drug.,F,72,6  weeks,6/8/2007,Rythmol
107, 4, 1 to 2 minute+ runs of PVCs,"On my 3rd week at 325 SR 2x/day:  Extremely fatigued and usually have to hit the rack by 8PM.  Also_ feel very anxious and paranoid at times_ crazy things_ like the dog is going to get out a door which wasn't properly closed_ etc.  Anxiety seems to be increasing on a daily basis.  Severe headache which usually hits right at bedtime.  Also_ having issues with recalling what I would consider ""long-term"" memory issues_ such as addresses_ phone #s.  Maybe it is my increasing age",The arrhythmia was controlled by Day #2.  I was on several other meds prior to Rhythmol.  I saw 3 cardiologists who did not seem to hear what I was relating to them.  The episodes would cause me to pull over when driving.  Electrophysiologist (Doc #4) gave me the option of ablation_ which has its own inherent risks or Rhythmol.  Despite the fact that this MD said that I could live a normal life style_ I am concerned to attempt working out again due to the increased fatigue.,M,56,3  weeks,6/1/2007,Rythmol
108, 1, I have had AF for 10 years.,Horrible bitter taste on the back of my tongue_ water tastes like bug spray.  Tongue and mouth are numb feeling. Chest pain_ muscle aches_ drowsiness.,I don't like the way I feel on this drug.  Can't wait to talk to my doctor and get off of it.  Plus_ you aren't suppose to eat grapefruie whild taking Rythmol. That alone is a reason not to stay on it!,F,57,5  days,4/15/2007,Rythmol
109, 5, A-fib - PAC,Metal taste which I hardly notice any more.,I've had PACs/AFib for 7 years which was controlled for the last 6 with beta blockers. Then it went bad and I went into AFib continuosly which called for stronger medicine to break.  My cardi put my on Norpace which worked for about 2 months then an EP moved me to Rytmol SR 325 BID after using it to break another bout of AFib in the hospital.  Since then I've been golden!  I still get the occasional 30 second runs of PACs but nothing more serious so far!  I'm only worried about the long term usage on my liver and whether or not this medicine will also eventually fail me like Norpace.  I REALLY don't want to move to a pacemaker or defib.,M,35,7  months,4/2/2007Email,Rythmol

112, 5, Ventricular tachycardia,None.,I have had two heart ablations to correct an arrythmia but both times within 18 months_ the arrythmia returned.  I have been on a long list of drugs in the past 16 years and this is the first one that has worked perfectly.  I have a normal active life because of Rythmol SR.  I now have a personal trainer and work out 4 to 5 days per week_ I no longer experience arrythmias and I finally feel like a normal_ healthy person.  I no longer have periods of no energy or difficulty doing simple things like walking.,F,39,6  months,11/20/2006Email,Rythmol
113, 5, Atrial fib,Slower heartbeat which resists increase when exercising; mouth taste muddy/metallic,I took Rythmol IR for 4 years and switched to Rythmol SR 2 years ago to better smooth out serum blood level throughout the day. The drug is fabulous. Without it_ the AF would wake me in at night and generally prevent relaxation at all.  Life wouldn't be very good if I couldn't take Rythmol.,M,64,6  years,10/7/2006,Rythmol

115, 3, continual PACs,water tasted funny.  exercise became very difficult; i got winded way faster than before and couldn't do the same intensity_ thus leading to some small weight gain.  constipation.,It decreased my PACs from 900/hr to 60/hr so in that sense it worked.  I'm not sure that it's worth taking a drug every day and feeling fat and constipated and unable to exercise to my normal intensity.,F,32,2  months,9/5/2006,Rythmol
116, 2, A-Fib,I had more shortness of breath and fatigue while on Rythmol. It did seem to quiet my heart_ but it was not worth the decline in my quality of life.  Prior to Rythmol I could jog slowly (12 minute pace)_ after taking Rythmol I couldn't jog 200 feet without stopping to catch my breath.  I prefer life with A-fib to life with Rythmol!,,M,55,2  weeks,9/3/2006,Rythmol
117, 5, V-Fib and atrial Flutter,None,This Drug has literally changed my life!!  I have had heart arrhythmias of numerous kinds my whole life.  I was always tired and never had any energy.  After taking this drug for over a year_ I have more energy then I ever have had before. (Guess that's what happens when your heart is actually pumping blood through your system properly!)  Before taking this drug_ I nearly passed out everday after walking up 2 flights of stairs_ now I can RUN up them.  I just can't say enough good things about this drug.  I truly hope that it is able to improve other people's lives as it has improved mine.,F,32,1.5  years,8/7/2006,Rythmol
118, 5, A-Fib,No side effects. I am taking 225 MG BID. Also on high blood pressure medication and digitalis. Of course I am also on Warfarin. Rythmol has not decreased my taste as far as I can tell and it does not make me tired. I started drinking plenty of water and do not drink alcohol any more.,Since stating in a hospital setting I seem to have A-fib events every 2-3 months. At first they were lasting 2-3 days but when I went into the office I was back to normal. Now I may have an episode which lasts about an hour and not maore than 12 hours and the fib seems to be at a regulated pace not exceeding 95 BPM.,M,62,6  days,5/10/2006,Rythmol
119, 2, For Atrial Fibrillation,Having been given a dose of 600 mg to restore sinue rhythm_ i became bradcardic with BP of 67/41 and pulse 47. I also suffered from profuse diarrhoea. My reading recovered shortly and I was successfully cardio-verted by electrical means the following day. I was told by the hospital that my symtoms were caused by a mystery virus that was not tracable. Has anyone else experienced similar problems with a single (high) dose of propafenone.,,M,54, ,4/18/2006Email,Rythmol
120, 1, PSVT,Bitter taste. Bitter taste. Bitter taste!!!,I weaned myself off because I could no longer eat. The metal taste was so incredibly bad. For example: try chewing an entire bottle of asprin. That's what my mouth tasted like. It was driving my crazy. Nothing helped.,F,33,5  months,4/9/2006,Rythmol
121, 5, brief episodes of a-fib_ psvt_ pvcs,some fatigue_ but I am also taking Toprol and Altace,This drug has been very beneficial for me. I have been on Rythmol SR 325mg BID for 4 years and am in sinus rhythm all the time_ except for an occasional pvc.  I definitely have found that Rythmol SR is more reliable than the generic propafenone.  My cardiologist tells me that Rythmol is the safest of the anti-arrhythmics.,F,67,4  years,3/11/2006,Rythmol
122, 5, chronic ATF_ ablation not 100%,bitter taste if I don't swallow pill quickly.  sometimes get light headache if miss my dose by 2+ hours.  Currently take 150mg TID.  Originally took 225mg TID_ but reduced level due to longer QT detected in a stress test.,Rythmol has been great.  Am active and can work/play/exercise with no problems.  Doc is monitoring_ feels I should continue on Rythmol as long as my heart is basically healthy.  I might try one more ablation at some point to get off of Rythmol.  Two ablations in two days eight years ago did not completely resolve irregular HR.  First prescribed Toprol and another drug_ but was lethargic_ gained 20 pounds and lost sex drive.  Would come home and collapse on couch.  Am scheduled to wear a holter monitor in a couple months to see if HR is still stable.,M,46,7  years,2/20/2006Email,Rythmol
123, 5, Ventricular tachycardia's,Maybe some blurred vision if I took it too close together,This sh** rocks. If you have life threatining VT's and your defibrilator is always shocking the hell out of you then you should take this medicine. I have had no VT's since so no more shocks. Plus getting up and out of bed does not raise my heart beat like it did before I took the medication. My life depends on this medication and yours should too. I highly recommend it if you think your going to die from a ventricular tachycardia or if your sick of getting shocked from your defibrillator.,M,27,1  years,11/20/2005,Rythmol
124, 5, -----------------------------------,Please remenber Rythmol SR is to be takn BID (twice a day) not TID (three times a day. The young patien described earlier had side effects likey becasue he was taking RSR TID rather than BID as indicated.,,M,50, ,11/2/2005,Rythmol
125, 3, Atrial Tachycardia and Non-sus VT,"Though this medication did not cause any life threatening side effects it did cause life altering ones. I was taking this medication for approx. 3.5 months. During the entire time I was dizzy nearly every moment of the day as well as being exhausted. I also experienced some major muscle pains and some provocation of more irregular beats during this time. This was in addition to the ""pleasant"" (not !) side effect of tasting a copper like substance while taking the medication.",Despite the side effects the drug did do a good job at suppressing my arrythmia(s). I took 225mg TID. I however just couldn't deal with the side effects. I'm young and active and this made me feel like I was 5 times older and constantly lethargic,F,28,3.5  months,8/30/2005,Rythmol
126, 5, Constant PAC's  P-Afib,None,Had one recorded self converting AFib event. Had continous PAC's 10-20 per minute.  Completely eliminated the PAC's_ which my Dr. says trtiggered the AFib.  No complaints_ works great.,M,38,3  months,4/14/2005,Rythmol
127, 5, chronic atrial fibrillation,None,Three years ago_ I was found to be in continuous/chronic afib during a routine ekg.  After starting Rythmol in a hospital setting and undergoing electrical cardioversion_ I have been in normal sinus rhythm most of the time since_ only experiencing breakthrough episodes of 3-24 hours duration every two months or so.  The episodes are largely asymptomatic and so do not cause any problems. My dosage is 225 mg three times a day.,M,62,3  years,2/10/2005,Rythmol
128, 5, AFIB/no symptoms,none,When exercising on a treadmill I no longer observe a heart rate reading of 180-190 for short periods of time.  The heart rate stays constant at 88-93 bpm. It does take a looong time to get down to 70bpm after exercising.,M,68,3  months,12/1/2004Email,Rythmol
129, 5, Paroxsymal AFib,I have had increasing episodes of debilitating AFIB breakthrough while on both toprol xl 100mg and tambocor 300mg(2x). I was also having renal problems (smelly urine_ really dark and fatigue)with elevated blood tests. I have been switched to Rythmol SR 325mg (2X) and toprol xl 50mg and altace.,The Rythmol SR is working great. I have less fatigue_ my renal problems have subsided and the benefits of the ACE are on board. The Rythmol SR though has done marvels though and I am able to lead a normal life without fear of passing out at the wheel of the car_ falling down stairs_ panic etc.,M,62,3  months,9/13/2004,Rythmol
