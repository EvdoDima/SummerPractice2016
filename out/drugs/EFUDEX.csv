1, 4, Basal cell & actinic Keratosis,Feel like I have a very bad sunburn. use it on arms before and did a great job. This time on forehead and scalp. Yes there is a burning sensation which is a well known side effect. But end of week 2 the skin under my eyes swelled up like huge blisters. It is hard to hide this. Doctor siad this is not uncommon and should disapear after I stop the treatment. I hope he is right.,,M,59,3  weeks5mg 2X D,11/10/2014,Efudex
2, 1, skin cancer,"Had basal cell carcinoma surgically removed from tragus (front of ear).left red_sore patch. All ""nasties"" removed. Advised to try Efudex. Have persevered for some time but to no avail. Consultant dermatologist says it is nothing to worry about but lying on that side is so uncomfortable. Efudex worked well on actinic keratosis on nose but no stinging_ crusting or other reaction on tragus. Very puzzling.",,F,79,10  dayssmall,10/22/2014Email,Efudex

4, 3, history of skin cancers on face,At dermatologist recommendation used on entire forehead and each side of my face down to the level of my ears--all in one huge treatment. As others have said_ my face was a horrible mess the entire time and very painful.I am age 86.,It did what the dermatologist desired but 3 months later I am still experiencing nausea. Has anyone had a significant reaction what would indicate that efudes has a lasting effect on different parts of the body?,M,86,28  days5% 2X D,5/28/2013Email,Efudex
5, 1, actinic cheilosis,I was to use this drug for 2-3 weeks for actinic cheilosis_ precancerous sun damage to lips.  After 4 days burning started and I stopped using the cream.  Lips continued to deteriorate.  On day 8 they were bleeding and burning horribly. On day 10 I went to the ER.  Day 11_ tiny improvement.,I was to use Acetonide 0.025%_ a steroid cream after the effudex treatment.  But that cream also caused terrible pain and burning sensation.  I look like a monster with burned_ swollen lips.  Only thing that helps is vaseline and soaking my lips in a bowl of warm water.  Yikes.,F,72,4  days5% cream 2X D,11/11/2012Email,Efudex
6, 3, pre-cancer treatment,Used it on my chest for 21 days and seems to have worked great but developed a rash on my back and stomach that persists after 4 months. Using it on my arms now and the rash is getting worse and spreading to my face. I hope it's a passing thing (doctors have said it's a typical drug rash and it'll go away) 4 months is a long time so I'm hoping they're right.,I think if your sensitive_ you can wind up with unpredictable side effects. It obviously enters the blood stream and can effect areas of the body that aren't targeted. Otherwise an effective treatment.,M,60,21  days5% cream 2X D,3/29/2011Email,Efudex
7, 4, actinic keratosis,Red skin_ itching_ scaling_ not as bad as I had imagined.  I am a month past ending treatment and still healing. I assume it worked.,"I used it on both arms.  I was unclear about instructions of ""light film"" but apparently overused it because was soon running out and my dermatologist suggested decreasing to once daily.",F,60,2  weekstopical 2X D,2/14/2011,Efudex
8, 1, For Bcc,After 4 weeks many more lesions appeared on arms cleavage_ breasts (started using on 4 lesions on rib cage). Stopped using efudex and many started to scab over. Once the scab fell off was bright red for 5 days then the erosion started and did not heal. Recommenced efudex use and now 4 months later the mess is unbelievable - large sores extreme pain. Doctor has told me to discontinue.,Used on my face for 4 weeks and all healed very well.,F,65,120  days30mg 2X D,10/11/2010Email,Efudex
9, 5, Actinic keratosis,"First time use was about 25 years ago ago it was very effective at reducing frequency and amount of cryosurgies.  The frequency of cryosurgies has started picking up again_ so this is my second use. You can use it 2xday for 30 days and react pretty hard_ or as little as 3xweek for 90 days for minimal burning.  Its strong stuff and I can't imagine a woman using it ""down there"" like the lady rating this product a ""1"".  But for face and arms_ it was well worth the period of discomfort and unsightliness; enough so that I am doing it again.",,M,62,60  daysthin coat 1X D,4/26/2010,Efudex

11, 5, actinic keratosis,Does this stuff make you fatigued and sleepy? Because I started it 4 days ago and am perpetually exhausted. Otherwise_ minor dryness 5 days in_ and sweaty greasy feeling where applied.,I am applying morning and night all over face to eliminate actinic keratosis and possible BCC_ to which I am prone. So far_ no big reactions_ just dryness and slight itchiness. But I am exhausted and can't seem to sleep enough_ have trouble arising and functioning with fewer than 9 hours of sleep. Can a topical agent do this? After all_ fluorouracil is powerful stuff. Can it get into the bloodstream? Anyone else have this happen?,F,54,5  days,10/14/2008,Efudex
12, 5, BCC's and AK's,Intense burning and itching. Rash spreading into adjacent untreated areas.,I have been using Efudex 5% solution for about 10 years. It was originally prescribed to treat an area on my forehead after a BCC had been scraped off.  Since then I have used it on other suspicious areas of my face_ arms_ and legs with great success.  I recently got a new prescription for the generic 5% cream and used it on my chest for about 12 days.  After I stopped the treatment_ my chest started to burn.  Everything I put on it just made it burn more. Then I got a rash all over my chest and on my neck in areas that weren't even treated_ and nothing I tried for the itching did any good.  I also used it on several areas of my face and one on my shoulder_ but these areas did not have such a severe reaction.  The ones on my face are almost back to normal_ and I am still treating the one on my shoulder_ but my chest is still very red and itchy.,F,58,19  days,9/21/2008,Efudex
13, 4, skin cancer,"Not exactly a side effect - it made my skin feel like I had a bad sunburn_ and the area on my face where it had been applied looked like I had a blotchy sunburn.  This is apparently the reaction that is expected.  My doctor said ""Apply it for two weeks_ or as long as you can stand it.  It will feel like you have a bad sunburn.""",It did a pretty good job of clearing up some cancerous and pre-cancerous areas.  These are usually squamous type cancer in my case.  I've had twenty or so removed surgically_ but the doctor thought that using Efudex would reduce the amount of surgery necessary.  According to the package insert_ Efudex is about 80% effective.  Some of the spots cleared up by Efudex have returned in my case - about four months after using it.  I applied it to my face in quadrants - two weeks per quadrant.,M,73, ,7/18/2008Email,Efudex
14, 5, ,Essentially no side effects.  The cream will cause the precancerous area to turn red and crusty.  After 4 weeks of treatment I feel comfortable knowing that it has removed any potential cancer cells.,,M,57,30  days,4/5/2007,Efudex
