0, 3, epilepsy,Agitation_ irritation_ hostility_ impulsiveness_ suicidal thoughts_ raised Dilatin,"Zonegran seemed to be good until it built up in my system and I increased it to 5500mg per day.  FDA nor the maker provided a warning stating it has negative side effects on patients who have had trauma and/or surgery.  Because this information was lacking on the container I had impulsiveness_ hostile feelings_ agitation_ and suicidal thoughts to name a few things.  It also resulted in me retiring early from a position I've held over 17 years.  Another warning that was missed is that this med can increase Dilantin and I became toxic on Dilantin.  Carefully and thoroughly research the med yourself and I would say that it's not best to trust someone totally because he or she has a piece of paper stating that an md was received.  ""FDA Approved"" is another thing that doesn't guarantee this med is safe and all possible impacts are listed/known  and that a neurologist is aware of hem.",M,50,6  months400 1X D,7/4/2016Email,Zonegran
1, 4, Migraine,I get extremely tired_ and very low. I lack motivation to do very much. I can be moody when Im tired and I was never like this before this drug. However it has stopped migraines....except during my monthly periods. The migraines are not as severe in this time but I still have one for a few days. I assume Zonegran doesnt help hormones!,I am relieved to have this drug. I was on Topamaz before Zonegran and I find this much better. My migraines are less frequent and I have a much better quality of life. I would like to reduce the dose to test if I can reduce it.,F,47,4  months100 1X D,6/5/2016,Zonegran
2, 1, Chronic back pain,Severe Anxiety_ Depression(not normally depressed) Suicidal_ Panic Attacks(never had before). Muscle tightness,I'd be really careful starting this medication. It made me into someone  I wasn't normally and almost committed suicide. Anxiety/Panic went away almost immediately when I stopped taking zonegran. My whole body relaxed when I stopped taking the medication. I tried this medication for chronic back pain from lumbar back fusion and cervical neck degenerative disk disease.,F,42,3  months100mg,5/19/2016Email,Zonegran

8, 4, Bipolar (mood swings),Pros: I had a lot of weight loss (about 25 lbs) and it cleared up my skin beautifully.Cons: It absolutely slows down thought process and I've lost a degree of my wit_ sadly. My mind is nowhere near as sharp as it was when I wasn't taking this medication and I've also noticed that it makes focusing quite difficult as well.,Aside from the side effects it has done it's job as a mood stabilizer for me. I've taken many different medications for the same reason but this is the only one that's seemed to work for me and have the least undesirable side effects.,F,27,2  years200mg,12/16/2015,Zonegran
9, 1, Epilepsy,Slower mental processing; inability to find specific words in context_ couldn't keep up in a long conversation with one person_ forget my train of thought_ reading became harder_ an overall understanding what was going on or explain anything was hard.,It helped stop my partial complex seizures but at the cost of slower mental processing. I will be going back to Lamictal. the switch occurred because we did not know that the other medicine I was on was a seizure stimulant so now hopefully I will be right back to where I was before zonegran came into my life and disrupted things.

10, 4, Chronic Migraines_ Seizure,Dizziness_ tiredness_ My actual dosage is 100 MG 2 times a day_ but I decreased it to just before night time unless my migraines are really bad due to the reaction with my Cymbalta.,I've had chronic migraines (when I say Chronic_ I mean I had crippling mind blowing head aches every day of my life since I was 9 years old) finally in 2011 I had a grand mal seizure due to an addiction overdose.  I was an addict as well since a teenager.  Combination of many things I was taking in great quantities was to much.  After that_ I was put on Topamax for my seizure (and I told the neurologist about the migraines to) in part the Oding was me trying to take stuff to rid the headaches ruling my life - well how it started years ago.  The Topamax was a godsend for a year and half. I mean it took away my headaches_ but then they'd come back so they would increase it.  Finally a year later it just stopped working_ but I requested to change the medication.  I hated Topamax - it made my arms_ feet_ hands numb_ my taste changed_ and I was so forgetful & had the worst memory. I lived in a brain fog. Zonegran was so much better.  It did cause some dizziness_ but nothing like Topamax. My memory and overall brain fog went away (tho the adderal come down often causes it now to :/) and everything improved.  I do get more headaches than on the Topamax_ but I believe it could be due to the Adderall as well.  They usually come when I am coming off Adderall.  I don't feel like this medication is as effective_ but I feel like the side effects are much much less.,F,27,3  years100 MG 1X D,8/8/2015Email,Zonegran

I was laying in the bed most all the time so tired and depressed fearful of another attack even when I didn't have a full blown headache.  I took Topamax but had to unpleasant side effects.  Zonegran and meloxicam have really made a difference for me.,F,42,7  days100MG 1X D,5/11/2015Email,Zonegran
13, 5, Migraines,So far so good.  I have a little eye pain which is manageable but none of the crazy side effects I had with Topamax.  Topamax caused tingling in feet so bad I couldnt walk_ terrible memory recall to the point that it was affecting my job and just plain fuzziness in the brain.  I also did not lose weight like a lot of people do so that is not a side effect that everyone experiences.  I havent lost any weight with zonegran either but it is a low dose.,I am also interested that a previous poster commented that it was helping her migraines on the right side.  I also get all of my headaches on the right side and it appears to be helping so far.  Just wondering if there is a coorelation.,F,41,1  weeks25,5/4/2015Email,Zonegran
14, 4, chroic migraine preventative,Just started this drug. Was taking Propranolol as a migraine preventative  for about a year and a half which had stopped working for me and which I believe had caused a deep depression. Was reluctant to start zonisamide/zonegran because i thought it might work like Topamax which was a horrible experience - tingly hands_ foggy thinking. So far Zonisamide is working well on keeping the chronic migraine pain on the right side of my head away and I my energy is beginning to come back. I am starting to feel normal again -- I also have a smaller appetite which I am going to take advantage of and really fix my eating habits. I hope this drug will continue to be effective for the chronic migraine pain. So far so good.,,F,46,2  weeks100mg 1X D,4/26/2015,Zonegran

17, 5, Myoclonic Epilepsy,Extreme weight loss (20+lbs) in a short amount of time_ loss of appetite_ extreme nausea (particularly in am)_ irritability. These have gone away now that I have fully adjusted to the medicine. This took me approximately 1 year_ but everyone is different. The nausea still shows up once in awhile but is bearable. Now all I notice is trouble recalling words (takes a little longer to find the right word).,THIS DRUG IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 8 years old and was extremely lucky to have an excellent neurologist/pharmacist team to help me find the perfect drug for me_ which even still took 10 years. I have tried Keppra_  which did not control the seizures_  I have also tried Depakote_ which the side effects were outrageous. This drug takes time to adjust to and find the correct dosage as any other drug_ the difference is for me was the nausea. I can only assume it was because of the rapid weight loss that was occurring. I should mention one of the side effects of Depakote for me (the previous drug before zonegran) was weight gain_ so I was approximately 40lbs overweight so weight loss was not an issue.  *If you do not have extra weight to lose_ this is not a good drug for you* It was the rapid drop that made it so difficult.  This only lasted for about 3 months for me (until we found the correct dosage). One thing I wish someone had told me is to make sure to eat a healthy snack about 1hr- 2hrs before bed such as fruit. Also carry snacks such as granola bars or nuts. I never wanted to eat_ but new if I ate even a few almonds it would make my nausea 10x easier to deal with. My nausea only lasted until I became acclimated with the drug (approximately 6m)_ my weight loss plateaued shortly after that. I have been the same weight since. I am a little concerned about the delay to recall the correct words. But as this is my only real side effect_ for,F,28,10  years300mg 2x D,2/18/2015Email,Zonegran

I do have weird dreams that will bring on unprevented migraines but all in all it has helped.

19, 4, Epilepsy,Anorexia weight loss of 20 pounds loss of energy . Depression when the dose was increased higher than 400 mg a day.

I maintain a VERY healthy diet to keep the fatigue_ headaches_ and brain fog to a minimum but I also make sure I get plenty of rest as well.The odd thing is_ I only just started loosing my appetite and lost 20 lbs. not sure if it's the RX. I also recently went off BC_ so it could be a combo. But it's the weirdest thing! I've been on Keppra and Lamictal before and they both affected me poorly in the personality dept_ so I'll take what Zonegran throws my way any day!,,F,29,4  years300mg,4/3/2014Email,Zonegran

A half hour later_ he fell to the ground and had a grand mal seizure. This lasted about 6-8 minutes.  In the hospital ER_ he had a severe headache and abdominal pains.

51, 3, chronic daily headache,minimal weight loss; Kidney Stone,Was so disappointed!  Took this drug for 2 months.  At the onset it didn't seem to help_ but after approximately 2-3 weeks my daily headaches were gone when nothing else had worked.  HOWEVER_ be sure to heed the warnings to drink alot of water so that you don't develop kidney stones - apparently I didn't drink enough because I developed a kidney stone.  I discontinued the drug so that I won't have to go through that pain again!,F,4,2  months,4/25/2008,Zonegran
52, 4, Post traumatic stress disorder,None that I am aware of.,My psychiatrist prescribes it for PTSD from childhood_ along with 2 mg. Ativan at night about 2.5 hrs. before bedtime.  The combination of Zonegran/Ativan has worked well for me for insomnia thus far.,F,59,2.4  years,3/28/2008,Zonegran
53, 3, migraine and bipolar,severe anxiety and agitation.  Nervousness.  Insomnia.  Weight loss.  Possible worsening of depression.,It has helped my migraines which required several Imitrex shots a week prior.  I had no idea of the severity of the anxiety before taking_ and I am a pharmacist.  At one point I thought I was going senile.  None of the common literature says anything.  It's really a toss up as to which is worse at this point.  I am taking Lamictal for the migraines as well_ and I have added Wellbutrin to try to help the depression.  Now I think I may need to add an SSRI or benzodiazepine.  I guess anything is better than a migraine.,F,30,6  months,9/11/2007,Zonegran
54, 2, epilepsy,"None at first. After about a month I started getting nausiated frequently and experianced frequent stomach cramps. Also felt very tired and ""out of it"".",Going to talk to my dr about going back on Lamictal,F,25,3  months,8/9/2007,Zonegran
55, 2, Epilepsy,Completely drained_ loss of appetite_ irritable_ and an all around lack of motivation to do anything.,No improvement on the seizures.,F,25,1  months,7/23/2007,Zonegran
56, 5, migraine,weight loss_ increased thirst,I am on 100mg every night.  I have not had any side effects except for weight loss.  This is the only med that has kept my migraines under control!,F,27,1  months,3/18/2007,Zonegran
57, 5, Migraine,200mg at night. I took this drug before I went to bed. I had to sleep with the light on just until I fell asleep because of extreme hallucinations that haunted me. The hallucinations were so real too. I saw monks hovering over me... It felt like a salvia trip sort of.  Besides this it works SOO GOOD for migraines preventative treatment. It works similar to Topamax just without the nasty_ unbearable side effects. Topamax made me stupid_ cold hands feet_ speech problems_ waking dreams and sleep paralysis.,This works soo good for migraines without the nasty side effects. It made me lose a ton of weight too. I gained it back when I stopped taking it for a bit but that could be because of a few other reasons though.,F,24,1.5  years,3/6/2007,Zonegran
58, 5, Epilepsy,I feel dehydrated_ which isn't so bad it makes me drink more water which is good for you and I have the muchies.  Other than that I feel good_ I have energy_ I'm very clear headed.  I like this stuff and so far no seizures_ I hope it keeps up!,,F,34,1  months,2/23/2007,Zonegran
59, 2, mood stabilization,Constipation_ constipation_ constipation.,I only took it for about two weeks when the side effect got to me_ so I don't know about any benefits the drug may have had.,F,25,2  weeks,1/15/2007,Zonegran
