2, 4, prevent pregnancy for 1 year,Prolong heavy bleeding_nausea_ cramping,After having my son in January of 2014_ I got on the shot the last week of April_ 2014. Beginning in May of that year_ I had the longest and heaviest period ever. It was nonstop from May 2014 until I quit in May of 2015. A month later_ my period went back to normal. But now since April of this year_ my period has been fluctuating like crazy. The days between periods are getting longer and it's like a guessing game. Although I don't mind that they seem lighter now days_ I worry it's messing with my fertility because I would like to have another child one day.,F,25,1  years,7/31/2016Email,Depo-provera

5, 5, Birth control,None. Never experienced any. I have received a Depo shot every 3 months for 23 years without any problems.,Have used Depo for birth control for 23 years. The two times I stopped taking Depo I went back to my same old cycle after 3 months of discontinued use. Never had a problem_ but didn't have any to begin with. My daughter and neice are all on Depo and no problems. I literally have no problems when I'm taking Depo_ it's the times I don't is when I have problems.,F,50,10  years,6/8/2016Email,Depo-provera
6, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Extreme mood swings_ depression_ anxiety and claustrophobia_ heart palpitations_ low potassium(never had this issue prior to depo)_ no sex drive_ painful intercourse_ lethargy_ and fatigue,Worst experience of my life. Depo has changed me into a hateful psychotic bitch. I'm not myself. I used to be happy!! I can't stand to be around my fiance? and his touch literally repulses me which was absolutely not the case up until receiving this shot. I don't want to be around people because my patience is gone. I'm always anxious and I cry almost everyday for no reason. I've begun having panic attacks and heart palpitations randomly. This stuff is poison and I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy.,F,28,6  weeks,5/30/2016Email,Depo-provera

8, 1, Birth Control,No period since starting. No noticeable side effects for first 2-3 years then began getting increasingly unwell with extreme fatigue.,I would not recommend to be on this birth control for more than 2-3 years. Very appealing not having a period but i believe looking back over the four years i was on Depo i started having unusual health problems starting with abnormal pap smear_ neck pain/stiffness and tingling/numbness in hand. then when i reached the 3 yr mark i began having hearth palpitations_ dizziness and a constant gurgling/rumbling in my stomach. This then developed into food intolerances and IBS. I also suffered from reflux_ indigestion and felt sick every time i ate resulting in a 12kg weight loss over about 8 months. Numerous testing and Doctors couldn't find anything wrong and didn't suggest i should go off the Depo. even after i questioned if I've been on it too long. I decide myself to stop my last injection due 4 weeks ago and am now starting to feel like myself again. I DO NOT RECOMMENED FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO TAKE THIS DRUG AT ALL OR NO LONGER THAN THE RECOMMENDED 2 YEARS. I had never suffered any of these side effects before DEPO !!!,F,41,4  years 1X AN,5/26/2016,Depo-provera
9, 5, To correct PMDD symptoms,Loss of period (after a couple months)_ and regulation of mood predominantly.  Increased energy_ weight loss_ ability to focus and remember better.,"I feel the need to put a positive review.  Most people talk about how bad their body reacts to this drug.  As someone who suffers severe (suicidal) depression and anxiety monthly_ this medince has saved my life.  I was on it for 8 years_ went off to get pregnant_ and recently went back on after my daughter turned 3.  I had absoluetly no issue getting pregnant.  Only after being off this medication did I learn the full extent of my PMS symptoms and needed to return to it.  This is not a drug for everybody.  Hormones are not something you should mess with lightly.  One shoes does not fit all.  Look at all your options_ and review all the information you can.  There are different hormones in each drug.   There are also 2 different types of this specific drug!  Make educated choices_ not ones based on other peoples emotions.  Not everyone has horrbile expierences with Depo.  I tried many different ""The Pill"" and they all had their own aweful effects on me.  Every Single One.  Everyone's body chemistry is different. That's all.",F,33,8  years30 4X O,5/19/2016Email,Depo-provera

27, 4, Birth control,Weight gain_ severe depression and mood swings. Increased appetite_ headaches. Sore breast_ ill feeling right before shot is due. Feeling tired and body aches. No period but occasional spotting.,The side effects of Depo are the worst I've experienced on any medication. I did not rate this medication on side effects. I rated it on the effectiveness. I have been on the shot off and on for 9 years. And the majority of the time I feel like crap and almost always feel like I'm losing my mind. But I've never gotten pregnant and I don't have a period. The weight gain and effects it has on my mental state are honestly the worst part but as of now it is doing what it's intended to do. I know you shouldn't be on this long term so maybe in the future I'll stop getting it. But the benefits outweigh the bad and I think with any medication you have to decide whether the symptoms are worth it. Not for everyone though.,F,24,9  years,4/6/2016Email,Depo-provera
28, 1, Birth Control,Loss of sex drive_ hair loss_ dramatic weight fluctuations_ strange moods_ anger at my partner_ constant vaginal blood flow_ heavy periods_ severe period cramps_ back ache_ dry skin_ passing enormous blood clots the size of a small fist_ anxiety.,I have had a successful run on the pill (triphasil) for about twenty years. My sex life is very active and experimental and I found the pill perfect for my sexual lifestyle. I went off it because I have a history of heart disease in my family (though I am very healthy) and because I decided on a period of abstinance after a tricky breakup. I started dating a man a few months ago_ and we decided to take steps to have unprotected sex. I was recommended the Depo Provera shot by my (male) doctor even though I later found out that it is just as dangerous for people with heart disease in the family. (Same doctor wouldn't give me the pill_ but would administer Depo) I was sick right away_ but put it down to adjustments etc - bad period cramps etc - but at 7 weeks my sex drive completely fell away and that has never happened to me in my life before. I was horrified and it had a terrible effect on my relationship because I assumed it was our problem_ not a chemical one. I will never_ ever touch this shot again. It is used to castrate sex offenders and it is outdated medical research that imagines this doesn't affect women. At 8 weeks my side effects have not subsided. My partner is being patient but I am terribly upset about this and feel that something of great value has been stolen from me.,F,48,8  weeks 1X AN,4/2/2016Email,Depo-provera

I've been feeling completely worthless and like I'm a bad mother all since this was put in.I was not informed of any side effects off the nurse that gave me this injection_ I phoned her and told her what was happening and she tried to convince me I'm wrong and the depo injection causes none of the above however if you look on the approved medical site of our health care system it very much states it all there to which she denied knowing anything about.

My skin was even better than ever_ or just normal..no issues.  I was on it for 2 years_ 18-19 years old. I am a highly sexual person & noticed my drive was really really low_ I wasn't producing vaginal lub & I had no idea why. So I started thinking about what did I eat_ wash with_ drink_ yadda yadda?? I knew it had to be something I put in my body causing trouble. Googled ""libido & low sex drive""_ BOOM. It's the depo_ immediately decided to stay off of it because it wasn't worth the damage. Why use it to prevent pregnancy from a good nut if I couldn't even enjoy the sex?? Pointless. So after about 6-8 months after not getting my 3 month dose is when I noticed change. I begin to have sore breasts (which I have never had sore breast_ even when I was growing boobs) I never experienced the sore nips & tits thing. So I figured ok my period will come back soon... & it did_ with no cramps (shocker_ I'm a crampy girl)_ regular flow_ every month_ same schedule. Now the libido?? Let me tell you_ I don't know if it was the age difference from now to then but it has came back a whole new system_ I have no problem getting hot & heavy.. We can skip the foreplay.

49, 1, Birth Control,Depo shot:I want to start of by saying that I know birth control affects everyone differently. But I also feel that many girls aren't truly warned about the side affects. Before receiving the 3 month depo shot I had to sign a form for bone loss. But I did not have to sign a form about all the side effects that plagued me while on this shot_ and for months after.An hour after receiving the depot shot I experienced my first panic attack. Extreme fear_ nausea_ choking_ sweating all out of nowhere. Then it happened again several hours later. I took the shot only once. It's been six months since I received the shot and I'm now having another panic attack. No one actually tells you that the depot shot remains in your system for up to 18 months.This doesn't even come close to the worst of it.A month after my depo shot I started my period. My period went from July to October NONSTOP. Continual flow_ every day_ for five months. It finally stopped when I ate a bunch of fresh ground flax seeds (they have estrogen in them_ which helps repair uterine lining - depo is progesterone which thins the uterine lining). I only received one shot and my life has been affected for six months and counting.It's amazing that my relationship survived the depot shot. I had/have an amazing man by my side who knew none of this was my fault and supported me the whole way.

The only reason I ever took hormonal birth control in the first place is because my cycles were pretty irregular_ and it stressed me out when my periods were late. The first couple of years on depo-provera were fine. I started weight training_ so I figured the 5 pounds or so I gained might be muscle. However_ I kept gaining even though I had a strict diet and exercise regimen. I was starving all the time and miserable. I cannot stress enough how horrible it is to be that hungry constantly. Over the past 12-18 months_ my sex drive has disappeared completely. It's really hard for me to reach orgasm_ which was never a problem in the past. Also_ I've started retaining water in terrifying amounts despite drinking several liters of water per day. My anxiety levels go through the roof for several weeks after a depo injection_ to the point where I have a hard time leaving the house except for going to work. This drug is so dangerous_ and no one wants to talk about its long term effects. I just want to be normal again.,F,29,3.5  years 4X O,11/9/2015Email,Depo-provera

57, 1, Birth control,Extreme weight gain_ hair loss_ depression_ bone-cracking_ delayed fertility_ withdrawal symptoms when stopping,I would not recommend Depo-provera to anyone. Its a very effective form of birth control but the side effects are not worth it. Please ladies_ just do not take Depo. It ruins many woman's lives.,F,20,2  yearsN/A,11/3/2015,Depo-provera

59, 2, Birth control,I just recently received my first shot of depo 5 days ago and immediately after I received it I almost passed out in my doctors office_ then felt extremely nauseous and hot and was red in the face and sweating everywhere_ then when I laid down I got the shivers and goose bump_ this went away about after 10/15 minute . Since then I've been very tired_ a little nauseous_ get light headed very easily_ less of an appetite and no sex drive at all. Id suggest you get the shot_ maybe 2 doses and see how your body reacts and if it works for you.,I've searched all online as to why I felt this way right after my shot and can't find anything and none of my friends have experienced this either. If anyone's had the same experience or has any info pls contact me I'd like to know,F,19,4  days150 mg,10/28/2015Email,Depo-provera
