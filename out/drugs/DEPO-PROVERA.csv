2, 4, prevent pregnancy for 1 year,Prolong heavy bleeding_nausea_ cramping,After having my son in January of 2014_ I got on the shot the last week of April_ 2014. Beginning in May of that year_ I had the longest and heaviest period ever. It was nonstop from May 2014 until I quit in May of 2015. A month later_ my period went back to normal. But now since April of this year_ my period has been fluctuating like crazy. The days between periods are getting longer and it's like a guessing game. Although I don't mind that they seem lighter now days_ I worry it's messing with my fertility because I would like to have another child one day.,F,25,1  years,7/31/2016Email,Depo-provera

5, 5, Birth control,None. Never experienced any. I have received a Depo shot every 3 months for 23 years without any problems.,Have used Depo for birth control for 23 years. The two times I stopped taking Depo I went back to my same old cycle after 3 months of discontinued use. Never had a problem_ but didn't have any to begin with. My daughter and neice are all on Depo and no problems. I literally have no problems when I'm taking Depo_ it's the times I don't is when I have problems.,F,50,10  years,6/8/2016Email,Depo-provera
6, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Extreme mood swings_ depression_ anxiety and claustrophobia_ heart palpitations_ low potassium(never had this issue prior to depo)_ no sex drive_ painful intercourse_ lethargy_ and fatigue,Worst experience of my life. Depo has changed me into a hateful psychotic bitch. I'm not myself. I used to be happy!! I can't stand to be around my fianceÃÅ and his touch literally repulses me which was absolutely not the case up until receiving this shot. I don't want to be around people because my patience is gone. I'm always anxious and I cry almost everyday for no reason. I've begun having panic attacks and heart palpitations randomly. This stuff is poison and I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy.,F,28,6  weeks,5/30/2016Email,Depo-provera

8, 1, Birth Control,No period since starting. No noticeable side effects for first 2-3 years then began getting increasingly unwell with extreme fatigue.,I would not recommend to be on this birth control for more than 2-3 years. Very appealing not having a period but i believe looking back over the four years i was on Depo i started having unusual health problems starting with abnormal pap smear_ neck pain/stiffness and tingling/numbness in hand. then when i reached the 3 yr mark i began having hearth palpitations_ dizziness and a constant gurgling/rumbling in my stomach. This then developed into food intolerances and IBS. I also suffered from reflux_ indigestion and felt sick every time i ate resulting in a 12kg weight loss over about 8 months. Numerous testing and Doctors couldn't find anything wrong and didn't suggest i should go off the Depo. even after i questioned if I've been on it too long. I decide myself to stop my last injection due 4 weeks ago and am now starting to feel like myself again. I DO NOT RECOMMENED FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO TAKE THIS DRUG AT ALL OR NO LONGER THAN THE RECOMMENDED 2 YEARS. I had never suffered any of these side effects before DEPO !!!,F,41,4  years 1X AN,5/26/2016,Depo-provera
9, 5, To correct PMDD symptoms,Loss of period (after a couple months)_ and regulation of mood predominantly.  Increased energy_ weight loss_ ability to focus and remember better.,"I feel the need to put a positive review.  Most people talk about how bad their body reacts to this drug.  As someone who suffers severe (suicidal) depression and anxiety monthly_ this medince has saved my life.  I was on it for 8 years_ went off to get pregnant_ and recently went back on after my daughter turned 3.  I had absoluetly no issue getting pregnant.  Only after being off this medication did I learn the full extent of my PMS symptoms and needed to return to it.  This is not a drug for everybody.  Hormones are not something you should mess with lightly.  One shoes does not fit all.  Look at all your options_ and review all the information you can.  There are different hormones in each drug.   There are also 2 different types of this specific drug!  Make educated choices_ not ones based on other peoples emotions.  Not everyone has horrbile expierences with Depo.  I tried many different ""The Pill"" and they all had their own aweful effects on me.  Every Single One.  Everyone's body chemistry is different. That's all.",F,33,8  years30 4X O,5/19/2016Email,Depo-provera

27, 4, Birth control,Weight gain_ severe depression and mood swings. Increased appetite_ headaches. Sore breast_ ill feeling right before shot is due. Feeling tired and body aches. No period but occasional spotting.,The side effects of Depo are the worst I've experienced on any medication. I did not rate this medication on side effects. I rated it on the effectiveness. I have been on the shot off and on for 9 years. And the majority of the time I feel like crap and almost always feel like I'm losing my mind. But I've never gotten pregnant and I don't have a period. The weight gain and effects it has on my mental state are honestly the worst part but as of now it is doing what it's intended to do. I know you shouldn't be on this long term so maybe in the future I'll stop getting it. But the benefits outweigh the bad and I think with any medication you have to decide whether the symptoms are worth it. Not for everyone though.,F,24,9  years,4/6/2016Email,Depo-provera
28, 1, Birth Control,Loss of sex drive_ hair loss_ dramatic weight fluctuations_ strange moods_ anger at my partner_ constant vaginal blood flow_ heavy periods_ severe period cramps_ back ache_ dry skin_ passing enormous blood clots the size of a small fist_ anxiety.,I have had a successful run on the pill (triphasil) for about twenty years. My sex life is very active and experimental and I found the pill perfect for my sexual lifestyle. I went off it because I have a history of heart disease in my family (though I am very healthy) and because I decided on a period of abstinance after a tricky breakup. I started dating a man a few months ago_ and we decided to take steps to have unprotected sex. I was recommended the Depo Provera shot by my (male) doctor even though I later found out that it is just as dangerous for people with heart disease in the family. (Same doctor wouldn't give me the pill_ but would administer Depo) I was sick right away_ but put it down to adjustments etc - bad period cramps etc - but at 7 weeks my sex drive completely fell away and that has never happened to me in my life before. I was horrified and it had a terrible effect on my relationship because I assumed it was our problem_ not a chemical one. I will never_ ever touch this shot again. It is used to castrate sex offenders and it is outdated medical research that imagines this doesn't affect women. At 8 weeks my side effects have not subsided. My partner is being patient but I am terribly upset about this and feel that something of great value has been stolen from me.,F,48,8  weeks 1X AN,4/2/2016Email,Depo-provera

I've been feeling completely worthless and like I'm a bad mother all since this was put in.I was not informed of any side effects off the nurse that gave me this injection_ I phoned her and told her what was happening and she tried to convince me I'm wrong and the depo injection causes none of the above however if you look on the approved medical site of our health care system it very much states it all there to which she denied knowing anything about.

My skin was even better than ever_ or just normal..no issues.  I was on it for 2 years_ 18-19 years old. I am a highly sexual person & noticed my drive was really really low_ I wasn't producing vaginal lub & I had no idea why. So I started thinking about what did I eat_ wash with_ drink_ yadda yadda?? I knew it had to be something I put in my body causing trouble. Googled ""libido & low sex drive""_ BOOM. It's the depo_ immediately decided to stay off of it because it wasn't worth the damage. Why use it to prevent pregnancy from a good nut if I couldn't even enjoy the sex?? Pointless. So after about 6-8 months after not getting my 3 month dose is when I noticed change. I begin to have sore breasts (which I have never had sore breast_ even when I was growing boobs) I never experienced the sore nips & tits thing. So I figured ok my period will come back soon... & it did_ with no cramps (shocker_ I'm a crampy girl)_ regular flow_ every month_ same schedule. Now the libido?? Let me tell you_ I don't know if it was the age difference from now to then but it has came back a whole new system_ I have no problem getting hot & heavy.. We can skip the foreplay.

49, 1, Birth Control,Depo shot:I want to start of by saying that I know birth control affects everyone differently. But I also feel that many girls aren't truly warned about the side affects. Before receiving the 3 month depo shot I had to sign a form for bone loss. But I did not have to sign a form about all the side effects that plagued me while on this shot_ and for months after.An hour after receiving the depot shot I experienced my first panic attack. Extreme fear_ nausea_ choking_ sweating all out of nowhere. Then it happened again several hours later. I took the shot only once. It's been six months since I received the shot and I'm now having another panic attack. No one actually tells you that the depot shot remains in your system for up to 18 months.This doesn't even come close to the worst of it.A month after my depo shot I started my period. My period went from July to October NONSTOP. Continual flow_ every day_ for five months. It finally stopped when I ate a bunch of fresh ground flax seeds (they have estrogen in them_ which helps repair uterine lining - depo is progesterone which thins the uterine lining). I only received one shot and my life has been affected for six months and counting.It's amazing that my relationship survived the depot shot. I had/have an amazing man by my side who knew none of this was my fault and supported me the whole way.

The only reason I ever took hormonal birth control in the first place is because my cycles were pretty irregular_ and it stressed me out when my periods were late. The first couple of years on depo-provera were fine. I started weight training_ so I figured the 5 pounds or so I gained might be muscle. However_ I kept gaining even though I had a strict diet and exercise regimen. I was starving all the time and miserable. I cannot stress enough how horrible it is to be that hungry constantly. Over the past 12-18 months_ my sex drive has disappeared completely. It's really hard for me to reach orgasm_ which was never a problem in the past. Also_ I've started retaining water in terrifying amounts despite drinking several liters of water per day. My anxiety levels go through the roof for several weeks after a depo injection_ to the point where I have a hard time leaving the house except for going to work. This drug is so dangerous_ and no one wants to talk about its long term effects. I just want to be normal again.,F,29,3.5  years 4X O,11/9/2015Email,Depo-provera

Since then I've been very tired_ a little nauseous_ get light headed very easily_ less of an appetite and no sex drive at all. Id suggest you get the shot_ maybe 2 doses and see how your body reacts and if it works for you.,I've searched all online as to why I felt this way right after my shot and can't find anything and none of my friends have experienced this either.

No bleeding_ spotting_ not even any cramping whatsoever. Months 2 and 3 came and it was a living nightmare. My period came towards the end of month 1 and since then_ I have not stopped bleeding. I am still bleeding and spotting and it has been very inconvenient to me in everyday life. I have unintentionally ruined clothes_ undergarments_ and at times the cramps would be so bad I would have to slow down completely walking and just stand there. This has been the worst experience of my life. The only other reaso I had for using depo was because the pills were starting to give me extremely unbearable headaches and there was extreme concern. Never again will I use Depo. Getting right back on the pill and hopefully my sex drive and sexual experience will be restored.,F,,3  months,9/6/2015Email,Depo-provera

67, 3, To control period pain,I loved it for 3 years_ and than it was just too much. In the last year i lost  over 20% of my hair in coronal pattern. Gained ~20kg. And that affected self esteem. After 8 months of investigation of the cause of hairloss_ everything was normal_ and gp suggested to get off depo to see if that is the cause. Getting off of depo was the worst experience ever. Proper withdrawal symptoms_ i was a ballon_ breast were sore and growing overnight_ same for other parts_ acne covered me_ ugly big pimples type. Extreme fatigue and depression. I hardly eat a part of what i normally do_ Often slept 20hrs and gained 1-2 kgs by the time i woke up. Had to buy bras weekly_ and new clothes twice a month. After two month i convincedthe GP i have to put stop to this estrogen overdrive_ and asked for a new BC_ and got Mirena. That stopped this nonsense overnight_ melted the extra kilos away_ and still going on.,I loved it_ but probably used it too long_ hence the late side-effects.I would go back if i need to_ but for max of 2 yrs at a time_ than change back and forfh with the alternative.

Once my doctor convinced me to get it every 3 months- big mistake_ I ended up with spotting and anxiety attacks.  I went back to once a year and it works fine to prevent my period (yes_ I know that this may not work as birth control).  I had been having incredibly heavy and painful periods_ to the point where I couldn't concentrate at work on those days.  I was also having anxiety_ depression_ and sleeping difficulties before each period.  Depo stops all of it (as long as I only take it once a year).,F,30,4  times 1X O,8/8/2015,Depo-provera

79, 2, Birth control,I've been on Depo for about 4 1/2 years now. I don't recall having many side effects in the beginning_ but the last 2-3 years I started experiencing many side effects_ which I believe to be caused by Depo Provera. They include: headaches (I seldom got headaches before the shot)_ dizziness on and off_ bloating_ stomach pain/worsening of acid reflux at times)_ nausea_ sinus problems worsened_ anxiety_ fatigue_ insomnia_ had one menstrual cycle since being on the shot_ occasional leg calf pain_ side pain_ chest pains_ body aches_ hot flashes_ mood swings_ and heart palpitations.,The only thing I would say about Depo Provera is that it's not for everyone and I don't suggest it if having a child is in your near future. Speaking for myself_ I've experienced many side effects recently_ and I'm not taking any other medications on a regular basis. Also_ it would be wise to get a bone density test done since there's a risk for osteoporosis after being on this medication for two years or more.

80, 1, Pregnancy prevention,,I really hope someone reading this will change their mind about considering this drug. It's more dangerous than you think. I was 17 and decided that I was ready to have unprotected sex with my boyfriend. I decided on the shot because I didn't want to have to worry about birth control everyday_ and I was young so I wanted to hide it from my parents. This drug ruined my life. It took only that one shot and one day before it destroyed my body. I had my period everyday for 6 months and then it stopped for a year and a half. My periods started again and they have not been the same since before I had the shot. I am now in horrible pain when my period comes to the point I get physically sick and they last anywhere from 3-14 days. It has been 6 years since I took the shot and I still to this day struggle with health issues from it. I suffer from depression_ horrible anxiety_ panic attacks_ cloudy mind_ fatigue_ tiredness_ sore muscles_ stomach issues_ infertility and much more. Whether you are a college student_ mother or a teenager in high school looking for a way to prevent getting pregnant_ please please please consider your health and how important it is to understand what you are putting in your body. What you can potentially be putting at risk once you start this drug is immense. Don't let it ruin your life.

So I decided to stop getting the shots and that's when I feel like everything really fell apart.  Everything I felt while on the shot_ got sooo much worse.  Physically I never felt so bad.  Headaches_ severe joint pain_ asthma_ Stomach issues_ bloating.  I started reading up on it and found that others went through that as well_ but I went to the doctor anyway.  They just diagnosed me with anxiety and gave me Xanax.  They wouldn't even consider the idea of it being from the depo shot.  I kept feeling bad_ so I kept going to the doctor.  I saw different doctors and not one would consider the shot being a reason for my symptoms_ but I was sure that was it.  The doctors ran lots of tests and they all came back normal.  They then diagnosed me with fibromyalgia_ asthma_ acid reflux and anxiety and put me on a bunch of medications.  It's been over a year and I'm still dealing with issues and symptoms that occurred after getting the depo shot.  Some days I literally feel like I'm dying.   I was fine before all of this and I wish I could go back in time and not get the depo shot.  So I wouldn't recommend it to anyone based on my experience.,,F,29,3  months,6/11/2015Email,Depo-provera

97, 5, Endometriosis_ Poly-Cystic_,No menstrual cycle. Increased appetite.,This form of birth control has been the best so far_ I have tried everything to try to control my pain and bleeding problems. Got the injection the first day of my cycle and within 8 hours my bleeding and cramps stopped. I haven't experienced any weight gain_ due to the warnings my doctor gave me. The shot itself doesn't cause weight gain_ it causes you to think you are hungry more often_ so with a little self control you should be fine. I haven't had any mood swings_ which is usually my most common and severe side effect with birth control. Usually so severe that I have to switch. No crazy_ no pain_ no bleeding. I am a happy human being again thanks to this injection. The only things I recommend are regular pregnancy tests_ not having a cycle can freak some women out_ and self control when dealing with the hunger_ this injection fools your body into thinking that it's pregnant_ therefore your appetite will increase. This is easily dealt with by keeping on a regular eating schedule and keeping a food diary. Also remember that long-term use of this birth control can negatively affect your bone density_ so I added a multivitamin high in calcium and vitamin D to my daily regiment.,F,25,2  months,4/20/2015,Depo-provera

106, 3, Prevent getting pregnant,I have been on this depo for around 4/half years.i was around 16/17 I did start on the pill first but it wasn't any good as I kept forgetting to take it so my mother arranged with the doctors for me to have the depo an ive been on it ever since! For years it was a blessing_ no periods no spotting_ no pain_ no fuss.. But recently due to when my next injection is due I'm getting bleeding/cramps an awful cramps/spazzing pains in my arms and legs. I spoke to the doctor who said just do more exercising an eat plenty of fruit such as bananas an drink loads of water which I already do.,Recently been thinking of stop having this depo but I'm affraid on what other options I have!,F,22,4  years,3/20/2015Email,Depo-provera
107, 3, Birth control,Hair loss,I started getting injections for depo when I was 18. It was like a wonder drug because I didn't get a period_ no weight gain and no mood swings. It was as if I was the perfect candidate for this birth control. Then I noticed clumps of hair falling out but it wasn't enough for me to stop using it. After 5 years I got off of it to later find out it was black flagged for bone density loss and you should only be on it for 2 years! Wish someone told me that before I commited 5 years to this birth control. Regardless_ I am 34 now and my hair NEVER GREW BACK!!!! I'm still battling with trying anything I can for a full head of hair again. So I wouldn't recommend using depo long term because you could have irreversible hair loss as I did!,F,34,5  years,3/19/2015Email,Depo-provera

I had heavy periods and cramping that brought me to the ground_ made me pass out they were so painful. Now the cramping is basically gone as is my heavy flow. Just minimal spotting. Which I probably won't even see anything next month. I love it and wish I'd gone on it sooner instead of experiencing 10 years of complete suffering. Plus not having to buy bulk tampons and pads due to heavy flow is great. I'll take the side effects.,F,24,2  months,3/18/2015,Depo-provera

Weight never fluctuated any more than 1-2 lbs up or down. Stopped shot in 2012 and got pregnant almost instantly with my  son (after being told I might not have children due to untreated endometriosis). Went back on depo at postpartum visit October 2013 and have not missed a dose since. Starting to notice that I have rather frequent and aggressive mood swings and persistent depressive moments. Depression runs in my family however Ive never experienced a near constant state of depressive rage like I have now; even my PMDD only occurred as it should before my period.

113, 4, Birth Control,Honestly_ none. See additional comments.,Yes_ I have been on Depo for 20 years. I never wanted children and had horribly painful periods when I was younger so this was a miracle drug for me. I did not spot or bleed like most seem to do_ I did not bleed for 20 years. LOVE THIS DRUG. But - you are not supposed to be on Depo more than 5 years_ and I paid for that. My current GYN forced me to have a bone density scan last year_ I now have Osteopenia (On-set of Osteoporosis) :( He said this is my last injection to pick something else. I do have daily aches and pains_ especially when climbing the stairs in my house_ bones pop and creak and I am only 40 years old. I am a smoker so BC pills were not an option for me. In the new few months I will be getting the Implanon implant in my arm. Praying it works similar to Depo.

No sex drive_ lower back pain_ depression.,Depo provera is the worst option to choose as a birth control_ to help reduce bleeding_ pain of uterus_ etc. I was weary of taking it because I heard it causes weight gain. I was struggling in that area. I told my Dr my concern. She said you won't gain weight your appetite will increase but as long as you work out and eat right_ you'll be fine. That was a crock of s*#! I was always hungry. My first month I was fine. 2nd month everything went down hill. I researched the side effects right away to see if it coud be the shot. It was the only thing different I had done during that time. Sure enough other women were complaining about the same symptoms. I was feeling weak. No energy or strength to exercise. Lower back pain_ muscle spasms_ depressed_ no sex drive. Thank goodness I only got 1 shot. I got my first and only shot in June of 2014. It is now Feb 2015.

I was diagnosed with very large ovarian cysts when I was 15 and they caused very heavy bleeding to the point I was anemic_ and very extreme and sudden pain that would put me in floor. The doctors would not operate because I was so young and because of the chance of infertility and hormone changes. They put me on the pill to shrink the cysts_ but after a year_ the pain came back and the cysts grew so I decided to agree to the shot. The pain is completely gone_ no heavy period- just occasional and very infrequent spotting_ and my cysts have shrunk immensely.

137, 1, Birth Control,HEAVY_ HEAVY bleeding after stopping the shot.  The cramps were worse than labor pains.,I took Depo for 11 years.  My doctors never told me that I should only take it for a maximum of 3 years or so.  Once I turned 40_ my new doctor said I have been on it too long.  My last shot was October 2013 and I started my first period March 2014.  Prior to this_ I only had cramps twice in my lifetime.  Once when I was 14 and again when I was 16.  The cramps I experienced after coming off the shot was WORSE than child birth.  I can take pain_ but this had me on all fours crying and asking my husband to run out and get Pamprin for me.  i used to have a normal 5 day cycle and use maybe 2 or 3 tampons for the first 3 days or so.  After coming off Depo_ I had to use 4 different types of protection for 5 straight days!!!  I used a panty liner to extend pass the regular pad placement.  I used a regular pad in the normal area.  I used another pad for coverage towards my rear and then an ULTRA tampon.  Yes_ I said ULTRA.  This is the largest size available.  I would have to change my tampon and/or napkins every hour on the hour.  You could imagine my horror in rush hour traffic.  I would have to time everything just right so I would be sure to be in a restroom by the next hour.  It was HORRIBLE.  I could literally feel my period coming.  My tampons were ALWAYS soaked.  I asked my doctor how long should this go on and was told no more than 10 days in a row.  This went on for 5 days in a row for 9 months.

Also didn't know that the shot was 100% synthetic! Nobody ever ever told me of the horrible side effects of this drug not once until I decided to find out why was so angry by process of elimination. Thoughts my actions and everything have slowed I'm not as nervous and tense and angry and frustrated I was completely abnormal and mood swings from hell I would never do this again! If any guy wants to have sex with me in the future he's getting a vasectomy. We go through so much hell as it is a guy can certainly do it! Septa means are pretty painless and are reversible in case he wants kids later but it's about time men have to turn  around and have to bend over backwards instead of us all the time! And in all honesty if there's any real honest girls out there the majority of us don't get vaginal orgasms anyway!! :) vasectomies all the way!!,,F,36,10  years3 mo shot,10/18/2014Email,Depo-provera

My gyno did NOT warn me about side effects or what could happen_ she told me it was just like the pill. I took the pill for a few years in the past with no issues_ so I was happy to hear that.WRONG. My sex drive went down to nothing_ I could barely get wet anymore_ I had severe mood swings constantly_ and I was bleeding/spotting nearly every day. Plus weight gain and increased appetite.Luckily the shot wears off for me in a few days.

He only told me that it doesn't actually make you gain weight but you may think you're hungry more often.  Big load of BS!!  I went through 2 surgeries because of severe endometriosis that thanks to other doctors who refused to listen I went for 10 years before I was diagnosed.  Anyway I was instructed I needed to be on BC that would stop my monthly cycle.  I have become depressed_ very moody (the littlest things upset me)_ loss of sex drive_ lower back ache_ constantly worried_ and has possibly ruined my marriage.  Now I have to deal with coming off of it.  I am done with BC and I am scheduled for a hysterectomy.  Hopefully this crap doesn't take too long to get out of my system so I can feel like my old self again_ the woman my husband fell in love with_ not this crazy person.,,F,39,2  years 1X O,8/21/2014Email,Depo-provera
179, 3, prevent pregnancy,So I wanted to be on the Depo shot bc I wanted to be able to have sex with my boyfriend with or without condoms and not having to be worried about getting pregnant. At first I started to like it_ it wasn't that bad... spotting is normal with this shot and I also know the other side effects which does not bother me to much but_ my first time having sex with my boyfriend (I lost my virginity) I was bleeding which is normal and that was last Tuesday... well we have had sex 5 more times after our first time and I don't feel any pain at all anymore just pure pleasure and I still bleed till this day while having sex. I'm not sure if that is normal and I'm honestly so sick of it and my boyfriend probably is too considering we have to constantly wipe up blood. I'm not really sure what to do but I want to get off this shot and maybe take the pill. Plus I've read alot of stuff about this pill and this is not good for your body at all! If you know anything please feel free to contact me.,,F,17,3  months,8/18/2014Email,Depo-provera

I seriously never recommend it to anyone. Once its in yr system its in. I do think a lot of it is to do with individual hormone balances as some people it works ok for and others not_maybe if they had a way of testing everyones individual hormones they might see a pattern on who it wont agree with_ but along with the bones loss-is it really worth it?!",,F,30,2  months,7/24/2014Email,Depo-provera

183, 1, Prevent pregnancy,It caused headaches (which I never had much of before ever)_Moodiness_ some nausea while on my periods (which lasted abnormally long as I can recall_ like even 2 weeks)_ anxiety_ stomach pain_ weight loss_ bloated stomach_ dry skin/loss in sex drive.._ I had a much better reaction to the pill_ which I was on for almost a year_ so if anything I would recomend the pill if you are truly dedicated to remember taking them daily_ but I suppose everyones different too and maybe the shot would react better with you_ although I wouldn't risk it like I did. I only took the shot twice before I decided it wasn't worth all these uncomfortable side effects and I had my last shot 5 months ago_ When I got off it and the symtoms lightened up a for bit but are back again and im starting to wonder when its going to stop. So exhasuting_ its  also hard on my boyfriend as well with me being so moody and in pain and I can rarely have sex with him ever since I had started (which was the reason I took birth control to begin with so it was pointless) _ definitely has caused some issues and stress_ I'd seriously reconsider taking this if you plan on it.,,F,18,6  months,7/11/2014,Depo-provera

Then after that you should be fine_ but it varies from person to person.My 2nd shot is due August 28th and I'm not getting it. What's the point of getting BC shot when all u do is bleed lol...so u can't have sex. Thank God my hubby is understanding.

The doctor did not tell me any side effects other than spotting for like four days a month or no spotting at all. I was very happy. I weighed 115 I'm 5'5. I had continuous_ long deep periods that never went away a month after taking. When I went back after three months for the next shot_ they weighed me and I weighed 135. I had actually eaten less in those months and I have a very high metabolism. I was unhappy about my weight. Still am. I continued bleeding heavily and gained ten more pounds. I told my step mom that this drug is evil and showed her these comments and she said to deal with it and she said I'm going to still take depo. I'm quite sure I can tell the doctor no because this is my body and this drug is evil. Mood swings_ unwanted blood 24/7_ absolute no sex drive_ very emotional_ I go to bed around ten and wake up at three in the afternoon!

215, 3, Prevent Pregnancy,I've been on Depo-Provera for a little over a month now and I was kind of scared and cautious about what I was doing with my body but I decided to get the shot anyway. I got the pill about a day or two about before I was due to have my period. After getting the shot_ I never got my period (even to this day). The shot is good for what it's supposed to do (prevent pregnancy) but it has many side effects. About a week after getting the shot_ I experienced mood swings and I would get upset and cry over everything. I was an emotional wreck. I still get this every once in a while. I've also experienced hot flashes. I'm only 20 and still too young to be experiencing hot flashes. I would start sweating and getting really hot to the point wear I needed to sit down because I felt that I was going to pass out. I also just started spotting and it's not any normal spotting to wear you would have with a regular period_ I would spot dark brown stuff. It was really gross. I'm getting abdominal pain (which isn't as bad as if I would have a normal period)_ I get occassional headaches and I've been gaining weight really quick. I would always be hungry and have a taste for different foods. I think this would be my first and last shot of Depo-Provera.

216, 4, Prevention of pregnancy,Spotting_ Depression_ mood swings_ hot flashes_ fatigued_ LOSS OF BOOBS!! The first two whole month I spotted straight_ from there on I spotted here and there sometimes nothing and other times it really sucked. as of the third shot I noticed it was when the old shot was wearing off and i had just recieved the new shot that i tended to spot or bleed. Before depo i would get light headed alot so i cant say much was the shot. In the beggining i would get depressed easily or cry for no reason at times. I would have mood swings out of no where. I would feel I was pregnant having all these symptoms and i would get hot flashes as well_ it was pretty embarrassing. as of now the begging of april on my third shot i always feel tired and fatigued and it is definately the shot! Worst of all the effects is had on my BOOBS! it is a very uncommon symptom but it happpend to me. I had just became a D last year_ on my second shot i noticed my boobs were smaller and so did my bf. they were small_ they ha,I rated the depo as satisfied because I took it to prevent pregnancy and have not gotten pregnant_ meaning the medicine helped. But personally I am just so fed up with the side effects this will be my last shot ever!! Once my body gets back to normal i might consider the pill because if you have bad symptoms you can stop whenever you'd like instead of waiting for it to run out. Every one is different and their body reacts differently to certain drugs. I really read into the shot before taking it but not enough_ or maybe i thought these symptoms wouldn't really happen to me just be cautious and take into consideration what you are possibly willing to sacrifice for the shot. 50% chance you will get any of the symptoms. It'll just have to be a risk you are willing to take. I wont tell anyone what they should do neither should anyone else_ unless its your family who have been through this then you should probably listen to blood relatives. Just remember it is your choice and consider all your options first. (:,F,19,3  times 1X D,4/5/2014Email,Depo-provera

219, 5, Birth Control,Weight LOSS!!!! experiencing some acne_ not bad at all_ two years after starting the drug_ increase in OCD? (don't know if it's related or not),I love this form of birth control! I tried two different types of the pill before trying the shot_ the first gave me depression and the second was just a mess. I was warned about weight gain when starting the shot but I actually lost weight when I started. I've been exercising daily since the start of the new year but I hadn't always exercised. I take a calcium supplement once a day to help with the bone density loss_ but who knows if that's doing anything. I read that repo is for long term use. I plan to stop taking it and jump right back onto the pill after three years. I've heard that depo can take a while to leave your system and become fertile again_ but that's why you just have to plan ahead. I've read a lot of reviews that call this drug poison and don't recommend taking it_ but you can't listen to that. it's good to know what is possible to occur when taking the drug_ but it's also good to know that EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT!!!! depo is a dream for me and a nightmare for others. you just have to try it out_ for longer than just the first or second dose_ and see how you like it. don't let the fear of what might happen keep you from trying it.,F,20,2  years 1X D,3/27/2014Email,Depo-provera

The bad things which can't be directly connected to depo but have seemed to be common among other ladies are that_ I haven't had any sort of wetness down there. At first I loved that_ until I realized that not being able to get wet made for painful and unpleasant sex. Loss of sex drive. I didn't really notice til recently that I have been mistaking my desire to have sex because I enjoy It_ for being horny. I don't get that 'must touch must be touched' feeling anymore.

I have been avoiding my boyfriend and friends because of how psycho I am and disgusting my face is. I have severe depression and seriously considered suicide. I'm only a month in and I don't want to go on another two months of not being able to control my anger and hurting people. I am so not this person this shot is making me. Don't get this shot. Just  don't even risk it. It has destroyed my entire fucking summer. Oh and it didn't even so what it was supposed to. I had nasty dark discharge for over a week. With horrible cramps.

290, 1, Birth Control,Horrible drug! I experienced severe depression and anxiety while on this shot. My anxiety caused me to start questioning my amazing relationship and I became extremely paranoid of everyone and everything. I had lost 13 pounds in a week and a half due to the severe anxiety. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. It has been a year since I quit the shot and since then I have gained 20 lbs and don't know how to get rid of it_ I still experience some anxiety and depression around ovulation. I stopped questioning my relationship and things went back to normal but my monthly anxiety causes me to back track again. I would have never in a million years taken this if I knew this before! No one tells you the side effects of this drug when they administer it either and their solution is to shove more drugs in you like anti depressants etc to make more money. stay far away from this drug!

Also I spotted that entire year and every time I'd go to the doctor they would tell me the same BS_ give it awhile. It'll stop. But it didn't. It went on for a whole year! It made my acne act up and not to mention I gained about 20 pounds which took me forever to get rid of. This needs to be taken off the market!

So_ at the time I was 17. It worked well for me - we were irresponsible kids and I did not become pregnant on this drug_ even though he probably ejaculated inside of me hundreds of times. I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS_ in fact_ its senseless and stupid to rely on a birth control so stupidly and not take further precautions like pulling out or wearing a condom_ but this is what we did. I do not recall having any problems with DP_ however not getting a period was a bit stressful as you may always be concerned you are pregnant. I took three doses_ they injected the medication into my bum cheek because the needle is quite long and my arm was too thin.No period is the only reason I stopped taking it. I am 23 now and have no long term effects from this medication.,F,17,9  days? 1X D,1/15/2013,Depo-provera
332, 1, Forgetful w/ pill_ shot convenient,"Weight gain_ stomach pain after sex_ low sex drive_ vaginal dryness_ frequent spotting and bleeding_ depression_ mood swings_ and headaches. Would not suggest this birth control method to even my worst enemy. It should be off of the market because of the side effects. When I got my first shot_ I weighed at 128. I'm only 5'1 but my curves spread out evenly so I didn't look fat at all. I didn't work out or eat too healthy before the shot. Just weighed my natural weight with no effort. Now_ after three shots_ I weigh nearly 150. I gained 30 pounds with absolutely no change in lifestyle. And that's not even the worst of the side effects. I can hardly have sex without bleeding everywhere_ especially towards the end of the three month time in between shots. My ""period"" is completely unpredictable_ ill bleed off and on_ and I mean intense bleeding NOT spotting_ for up to three weeks of a month. Also_ there's intense stomach pain after sex to the point where I almost vomit. My sex drive has completely disappeared_ which is not normal for an 18 year old hormonal girl in a loving relationship with a very attractive guy. The vaginal dryness is terrible_ makes me feel like a post-menopausal woman. The worst of the side effects would definitely be the depression and mood swings. This recently started after my 2nd shot. Ill cry myself to sleep for no reason_ I have a great life. Anything my boyfriend says can throw me over the edge and turn me into a raging b****.

Within 2 weeks of getting the shot_ I fell into a deep_ dark depression_ and within the last week I have been having suicidal thoughts. Never before in my life have I felt like this.

Not only is it just not there - but the fact that I have gained almost 10lbs in SIX WEEKS_ and the fact that I am constantly on my period_ just makes me feel gross.

366, 3, Birth control,From my research_ I know this shot is very effective and it works for me so I guess it is. I only gained about 5 pounds and its been almost a year. It does make me very emotional to the point that I just cry over anything especially when I'm by myself. I've had times where i was ver depressed too.I get headaches when I stand up after a certain amount of time sitting. Sometimes when I  stand I even have to close my eyes for a few seconds because everything looks black. It's very effective and trustworthy but the emotional part is very tough to deal with. Big Decrease in libido.  I also read tht it's not good for your bones it decreases bone density over time.

However_ because I have a severe case of endometriosis I have no other choice but to take it because no other pills_ patch_ ring etc..will work. I bleed through all of them. I am moody as hell all the time and have developed a very quick vicious temper. I've been on it 3years and have gained 15lbs (I am only 5ft tall so that is horrendous!). It's hard to control what you eat because the cravings are insane. I have managed to keep an eye on what I eat lately which seems to help_ I lost a little weight. Sometimes I forget things right after someone tells me. Not sure if my brain is preoccupied or if this is from the shot. I also have disorganized speech. For example_ if I'm trying to explain something my words get jumbled up or I use wrong words and it ends up making no sense. Not sure if this is really a side effect but I saw it on one of the other sites and it said it was. MY knees recently started to really bother me_ its kind of like they feel swollen and they ache. I still get bad cramps sometimes but no period. I do randomly spot throughout the cycle. I absolutely hate this shot but its the only thing that will help slow down/treat my endometriosis and stop my heavy periods so I assume its serving its purpose. Otherwise I would NOT recommend taking it! Thank god for my boyfriend being so patient and understanding or I would lose my mind,F,24,3  years 4X O,9/28/2012Email,Depo-provera

375, 1, birth control,constant bleeding_ uterine lining never returned to normal_ extreme anxiety_ panic attacks_ depression,"My doctor insisted this was the only suitable birth control and told me the only side effect was a good one: that I'd stop getting my period. It concerned me. I wasn't told of any other side effect possibilities. When I ended up bleeding for the full 3 months I was told the bleeding would stop if I took another shot. I had been set on refusing another shot and only went to the clinic to find out what to do about the bleeding. They convinced me another shot was the best cure. After six months of non-stop bleeding I returned and they claimed that excessive bleeding was not a known side effect. It's been 7 yrs since the shot and my periods have never returned to normal.Anxiety and panic attacks: I used to be ""zen"" calm. Nothing got me riled. I got along with everyone_ even people I didn't like. About 3 wks after my first shot I started flying off the handle over simple things. I was yelling at my child on a near daily basis. The panic attacks started shortly into the second shot. I have tried to take herbs and supplements to stabilise my moods but still have to explain to people when I'm having an attack so they don't take it personally. The depression went away after about a month of the last shot. I've gotten better at identifying when it's me and not them. This drug is horrible. It could have wrecked my life.

But now I can't sleep through the night_ I feel sick to my stomach before bed- and heat flashes can strike unexpectedly and last from five to ten minutes. And of course there's the nausea. I'm sexually active_ and I'm ALREADY a paranoid person. This anxiety combined with the nausea is enough to make me think I'm pregnant (even though I'm not).

But then_ at the end of my first shot_ all holy hell broke loose.  I had a three-week-long period_ I started to have horrible panic attacks_ and I began to feel depressed.  Now_ at the end of my second shot_ I feel even worse.  The depression has made me doubt the future of my relationship constantly.  I get panic attacks on a weekly basis.  I get very angry for no reason several times a day.  I have gained 20 pounds despite a better diet and exercise.  Thank god I finally have my IUD and all of this can stop.

424, 1, On and off Depo-Provera for 5 years,Awful Depression_ Nervousness/Anxiety_ Loss of sex drive,I had been on the Depo-Provera for 5 years since I was 16 (I know some people say you shouldn't be on it for more than 2 years at a time but the nurses/doctors never seemed to have a problem with me carrying on with it). I had NO problems or side effects for at least the first 2/3 years (I was it a relationship and also had the next shot every 3 months in time for it running out). However_ since my relationship ended 2 years ago I have come off and gone back on it a few times (i.e. had a few months break in between the shots wearing off). I think this is where the problem was for me. As I said I had no problems up until I took a break off it and then had another shot. The last shot I had was last summer (June 2011) after over 6months off it_ and I did not have another one in September when it wore off. I believe that coming on and off the injection is where the problem lies.. initially in June I began to feel very depressed for no reason after the shot..It did get a bit better  as my hormones settled down_ but September was when the serious problems started. I had no idea at the time that it could have been down to the injection wearing off and my hormones re-adjusting! I began to develop awful depression... I have never had it before and it was far far worse then I could ever imagine. I just gradually felt incredibly low all the time (despite a relatively happy and stable life)_ I developed awful anxiety and nervousness which affected me physically in terms of heart palpulat,F,21,3  months 1X O,5/10/2012,Depo-provera

I also have been so deppressed that i am now taking prozac twice a day as well as xanax twice a day for the panic attacks. It has gotten so bad that i cant work anymore and for awhile couldnt drive due to the panic attacks and shaking episodes. Since this shot i have not been myself at all.

Im due for my next shot in a few weeks and will not be going in for it. Theonly thing my doc told me was that i could gain 5 lbs if i wasnt careful. Well ive gained over 30 lbs since starting this!!

I never had migraines before but now they're very frequent. I'm unable to sleep at night and unbearably exhausted and lacking energy all day. I've been depressed and gained some weight. I used to have very clear skin but now I have more acne than before. I already had frequent panic attacks but the anxiety and panic attacks have gotten much worse. I had a complete loss of sex drive for a while_ but that got better after about 6 weeks. I've had a lot nausea that feels like a constant motion sickness. The worst of the side effects though is the anxiety_ depression_ insomnia_ and migraines. Depending on how my next shot goes_ I may get it a 3rd time just to see if things will get better with it.

Up until starting the shot I had never had a UTI_ I have either had one for the last three months that hasn't gone away or they keep coming back constantly. I have been in and out of the hospital for the UTI infections and a case of extreme constipation (I had to be hospitalized for it). My hair falls out in huge chunks. I have been bleeding for almost the last month straight with no stopping. But the worst symptom has been my constant mood swings and no sex drive. I have never been more moody or depressed in my entire life. I cry and get sad all the time for no reason at all_ and there is no consoling me. I have almost no sex drive at all_ and when we do have sex it is so painful that it isn't even enjoyable. All of my symptoms are starting to put strain on my relationship with my fiance.

451, 5, Birth Control,Sex drive is sometimes INCREASED_ no menstrual cycle (very happy about that),(Other = Year / 2nd time on Depo_ on it 2 years so far this time  The first time I went on Depo it was pretty much so I wouldn't have to remember a pill every day.  I also liked the idea of a non-estrogen birth control option.  The best part_ NO PERIOD!  If you're not trying to make a baby_ why have a cycle?  It's not medically necessary.  I then went off for 2 years.  I did take quite a while for my period to return to normal_ but that's just my body.  It's different for each woman.  On my 28th birthday_ I gave myself the gift of going back on Depo.  Again_ no cycle.  Also_ I'm actually allergic to latex (yea_ always the alternate condoms for me).  Seeing that I have a long term_ faithful boyfriend and we're free and clear_ we don't need them.  The most important reason is that having a baby now would not be safe due to the medications I'm on (risks of developmental problems_ etc).  I've had no bone density problems_ no ovary problems_ nothing.

That's when I started doing my research and find all of this out_ this drug SHOULD BE BANNED! Right now my body is telling me I'm pregnant and that's impossible! My stomach is so swelled I look like I'm 4-6 months pregnant_ my feet and hands even swell! I have to wear sweatpants because my jeans don't fit me with this stupid baby belly!

I am so tired it's unreal. Im starting to fail all of my classes in college because I prefer to sleep instead of do homework. The tiredness is a big factor for me_ it's also making me very cranky and angry ALL THE TIME and starting to ruin my relationship with my boyfriend. He's starting to say things like_ ""You never used to yell at me like this"" or ""You never used to act like this"" If my boyfriend is at work and im home alone_ most likely im crying for no reason. I feel very ugly and unhappy with myself now. Always seem bloated and craving foods_ wanting to eat all the time! The day I got the shot it stopped my period immediately but as soon as my next period came around its been constant bleeding or breakthrough bleeding (which is a very dark mucus looking blood). I've had it for about a month now. The first month is when I cried alot and felt very down on myself at all times which made my sex drive completely disappear. I didnt want my boyfriend looking at me while I change_ we stopped taking showers together_ we stopped kissing and everything. But now it's kind of changed_ I want sex all the time now_ literally every second I see him_ I'm making moves. It's a bit rediculous. The problem with that now though_ is that since im constantly bleeding_ we can't ever even have sex because it's pretty gross.

I didn't even realize how bad it was getting because half the time I felt totally normal & at times I can be a little intense and blamed it on myself. I went from being a generally happy person to being so negative. I was moody & would cry uncosolably. I was me sad for no reason_ angry_ and totally irrational. I couldn't handle any pressure. If the smallest thing went wrong I'd fly off the handle. I became a little paranoid and combatitive. Then I started feeling depressed_ as though I was a bad person for behaving so badly.

I've been moody and depressed the whole 12 weeks.  I have zero interest in sex and that makes me angry!

I have not had a regular period_ or any period for 9 years_ except when I went off it when I was 23 because I had cervix cancer and had to have surgery_ I'm not sure if the cancer was related to depo or not. Until recently reading posts about Depo_ I never thought about side effects such as depression and loss of sex drive and weight gain..... But now I definitely can associate these with Depo_ and I have had these symptoms for years. Over two weeks ago now_ I started to spot.... It's not a period_ it's started as a yeast infection_ with light pink blood_ that lasted 3 days_ ever since its been dark brown mucus_ apparently it's called breakthrough bleeding associated with any term of use of Depo..... Although Depo does have different effects on different women_ I would not recommend prolonged use_ I want to start having kids_ and now I have to wait at least 12 months for it to clear my system before I my be fertile. I wish I had studied up on it years ago_ but my Dr. Never ever said anything about it_ he would just give me a yearly prescription for 4 doses a year....

I have back pain to the point that I can barely move and it's not just related to motion. I can be dead asleep and wake up with such a spasm and shooting pain it takes my breath away. I hate everyone and on the verge of a divorce because I am so angry all the time. I am not a violent person but now I find myself wanting to smash things_ yelling and screaming all the time.

It's the worst_ I don't want anything to do with anyone I cry for no reason nothing makes me happy and when I do become happy I cry even more because I feel so guilty for being so angry all the time and that puts me back into another depressive fit. I was diagnosed with uterine fibroids which the doc is pretty sure that I am seeing due to the shot. I feel totally out of control and am miserable. I got the 3 month shot and am 7 weeks i,It may seem like a great thing but really check into this. I am scared what the residual side effects may be for me.

The first time I took it_ I was about 22 and I did it because I was taking Accutane for my acne and was forbidden to get pregnant while on it!  It is easy to take (once every 3 months)_ and prevented my usual PMS acne flare ups so I thought it was worth it.  So wrong.    Each time I have taken the shot_ it has made me depressed.  I suffered major mood swings and crying fits.  I went through a lot of fatigue and had frequent_ random cramping and spotting throughout the three months. This time I even experienced a harsh full-fledged period that lasted off and on for almost a month!  I also put on at least 10 lbs this time around_ even with a good diet and exercise.My sex drive was completely gone and the shot negatively effected my relationship with my boyfriend because of my erratic behavior.  Now that I think about it_ it affected me this way at 22 as well but I just thought it w,I would not recommend this product_ however_ I do have a friend who is taking it and her only complaint is weight gain around her midsection.

Normally pretty mellow but this turned me into a crazy person.,"I took Depo because I smoked at the time (since have switched to e-cigarettes) and didn't want to use non-hormonal birth control (i.e._ ""bullets"" or ""film"" or ""foam""_ sucks!)  This stuff turned me into a completely moody hormonal crazy brawl-starting beeyatch of the highest caliber.  I thought I was going to end up in jail or divorced.  Libido?  Laugh_ what's that.  No sex for hubby unless I felt too guilty.  Kids made me crazy_ hubby made me crazy_ all the things I loved (snowboarding_ etc.) I couldn't care less about.  Bored_ tired_ angry_ irritable_ depressed...started thinking the world would be better off without me and my crazy outbursts.  At the three month mark_ told the doc in no uncertain terms that he wasn't putting that crap in my system again_ and went back on Nordette_ which I used several years ago with minimal side effects.

I first would like to state my side affects i experienced_ were constant weight gain_ abnormal increase size in breast_ lactation_ decrease sex drive_ vaginal dryness (initally)_ depression_ and headaches.  I would like to mention that once i terminated the usuage of the drug by physician recomendations_ I lost my menstrual cycle for about 5 years_ my breast tripled in size_ and lactation became more frequent.  My skin darkened 3 shades.  I eventually had a breast reduction and removed the mamo glands (to stop lactating)_ however the weight gain was consistent_ despite all the dieting and work out.  I found out about years later that I had a tumor on the pituitary part of the brain_ and ovarian cyst_ in which my attending physician believe may have been triggered from this drug.  This drug may work wonderful initially_ howeve,You may not have side affects initially_ however after prolonged usuage of this drug_ side affects are often detected.  if you do not experience a menstrual cycle within a year or years_ please be sure to have lab test performed for brain tumors_ ovarian cyst.,F,37,3  years 1X O,1/23/2012Email,Depo-provera

Horrible reaction and i hate how i feel.  I feel like an old lady and i feel my immune system is not the same. But any birth control that gets sued for 700 million_ shoud be a done deal. I wish i knew about it prior_ but of course doctors try to make everything sound perfect and they like to keep secrets about the dangers woman can experiance other than osteoperosis.

531, 1, Contraception,I started depo in September 2009. I had gone into the doctors for a repeat of the pill and they recommended the injection (silly me for trusting them...lesson learnt never take any medication without thorough research!) At first I thought the drug was perfect for my first two shots at least. Then I began to notice mood changes I was experiencing bad mood swings_ but more importantly I felt really angry and for no reason at all. I mentioned this when I went for the next injection and the nurse said 'no it can't be the depo' do I had the injection...and more after that as I had 7 injections in total - my last was January 30th 2011.  At the this point in time i bad gained 16 lb in the time i had been taking the injection and my dress size had increased from a stable uk 10 since adulthood without ever dieting to a 14.  It was only after the 7th injection that I began to research depo and realise that this was the reason I was feeling so awful_ by this point I was very tired_ suffering with headaches_ my asthma had got worse and the mood swings were horrific. I also got kidney stones which were really painful and although my doc denies any link to the depo i think there is quite  a logical one seeing as stones form from lack of calcium and depo causes osteoperosis as it reduces the amount of calcium in the bones. whilst on depo my periods stopped entirely I would only have spotting when wiping while on the injection.My poor boyfriend put up with a lot_ but I am thankful to say,,F,31,9  times,1/12/2012Email,Depo-provera

Because I ended up with one of the less common ones and was in pain. It is somewhat satisfying for me though. I don't have to remember it everyday.

539, 4, Birth Control,A lack of energy,I¬ím commenting because I pray my experience will help somebody. I took depo in my early 20's for a year. If you have an active exercise life before depo (high metab) you will be fine with weight control. If you don't exercise you are going to gain weight and it will be harder to start exercising due to a decrease in energy. My doctors always tell me to take a multi vitamin and a calcium supplement while on depo. I have gotten pregnant after taking depo_ but it took one year for my body to regulate from the birth control; compared to before_ I use to get pregnant off a kiss. Don't stay on depo longer then what doctor recommends overall I haven¬ít had any problems that I know about with depo. I know that it can cause bone density so if you can try t take a (calcium supplement). This is my own opinion of the birth control and depo has done its job in my case.

544, 2, Horrible periods/ Endometriosis,I never had weight gain_ mood swings_ periods_ acne or any other side effects from this drug. But_ 1 1/2 yrs ago I shattered my leg doing an everyday thing and all my doctors said it was a freak accident since I should not have broken it that badly (2 plates and 20 screws to put it back together to give you an idea). I asked if the Depo could have caused this and was told no; that I'm young_ active_ and they wouldn't worry about it causing enough bone loss to effect me in that way for another 5-10 years. Well_ so much for that. I got a bone density test and am borderline osteoporosis at 33. My score was -2.1 and full blown osteoporosis is at -2.5. I of course changed doctors and was told that there is a clock ticking when you are on Depo. Usually people come off it before it does too much damage_ or a bone scan will show that its time to get off_ but_ unfortunately my clock ran out before anyone caught it and shattered my leg to the point that it'll never be the same again. 9 years of no pain and no periods is definitely not worth the limp I'll have for the rest of my life. I didn't read thru all the stories on here_ and some of those I did read touched on bone density_ but just wanted to share my story to show what can happen when this shot robs your bones of what they need. If you choose to be on it_ be proactive and ask for bone density test every year after the first 2 years on this drug. I wish I would have.,,F,33,9  years1x 3 mos,12/28/2011Email,Depo-provera

It deformed my body where they gave me the injection.  it killed the muscle and caused a permanent dent on the side of my hip.  It was also wrongly prescribed by the doctor.  i have a history of clots that he was aware of and it can kill you.  the drug company tells you not to take it if you have had clots.  the doctor refused to agree is still giving it to patients.  the worst side affect is that it completely destroyed my hormone balance and caused a horrible rash that i have been suffering from for almost 2 years and going...  this was the worst mistake of my life!!  i don't know how long it will be in my system but i am desperately trying to figure out how to purge it out.  I was on for 9 months and off for 1 1/2 years but the rash is still making my life miserable. If anyone knows how long it will take to purge this poison please let me know.

I had previously been on the pill from age 18-25.  While the pill helped my cramping_ I still had severe mood swings.  I decided to try something new and went with Depo.  The first three months I felt amazing_ no mood swings_ no crying_ nothing.  However_ the day after my second injection_ the entire left side of my body went numb_ my throat started closing up and my tongue was swelling.  I went to the ER & after a CT scan & multiple vials of blood being taken_ they said I was fine.

619, 1, Birth control,I really and truly regret using the depo shot. i started it october 2010 and continued to get two more shots until may of 2011(no bleeding)but because i noticed i was having side effects like really bad head aches and weight gain my bf suggested i discontinue. so...i didnt get the shot on may 3rd as scheduled and my cycle came on the 11th and continued until like the 27th of may then stayed off for like two months(i thought i was pregnant or something)and now it is aug 5. my cycle came back on aug 1st.i thought it was going away yesterday(which would be normal for me) but it came back today full force! im soo scared i hope it doesnt last as long as it did in may or longer!!! i will totally kill myself! i start my sophmore year in college on the 22nd and i just really dont need this!!! why is there no answer?? scientists find time to clone lambs and make tiny robot cars but no one can cure this nightmare???? they could have at least been considerate enough to warn us!!!!!,,F,19,9  months150 MG 3X AN,8/5/2011,Depo-provera
620, 3, To prevent pregnancy.,Lack of sex drive_ SEVERE irritability_ unexplained anger_ worry_  lack of interest_ very easily depressed_ highly unmotivated,This is the first birth-control I have ever used_ and I didn't go with the pill because both my mother and sister missed one day and ended up pregnant- I am full-time student and was working_ so I figured I'd miss a day and have to start over. The first month of this shot was fine_ but the last two have brought out the emotional effects. I have unexplained and nearly uncontrollable rage and anger_ and then I sink into a depression that makes me think of suicide. I have stopped hanging out with my friends_ I am not talking to my parents_ and I snap whenever I am bothered_ even with something minor. I like this shot because it has a higher rate to keep me from having a baby_ and my boyfriend and I really can't afford a child [I'm only 19_ and he's 24]_ especially if I plan on going to a university. I can't stand the emotional torture it is putting me through though_ it's unbearable. It is also causing sexual complications in our relationship. [Thank God he's patient with it though.] I'm not taking this shot anymore; if it's doing this to me now_ I don't want to think about what it'll do later on.

The more research I've done_ the more I've come to realize most if not all of these symptoms are from the shot.  Most of them seem to be worse not long after I get the shot and get a little shortly before I'm due for another.  I still have a shot in my system but I will definitely be seeking another option afterward. I'm tired of feeling like this!!  I wish I would have put all this together sooner and saved myself so much time of being so miserable.  There are days when the brest senistivity is so extreme I can't stand the feeling of fabric on my skin.  I will become so fatigued but I can't sleep. I've had constant problems with constipation and quite a bit of weight gain.  I was on Depo Luprin (sp?) for a couple of years instead of Provera and the symptoms were quite a bit worse_ to the point that I refused to take it any longer.  That medication is used frequently for endometriosis.  Make sure you do your home work before blindly taking a medication prescribed by your doctor.

It took about a year before they showed up.  I was not sure it was the shot and went to my gyno first.  She said the shot could not be giving me this trouble and sent me to a nuerologist.  After many many test he could not help me.  He as well said the shot was not the cause.  I then went to a rheumatologist b/c of the joint issues.  He too could not help. After researching the shot myself I then became convinced that I was having side effects from the shot.  I just wish I had listened to my gut over a year ago when I started having trouble.

Loss of interest in life and very antisocial and constant feeling if being i,I would not recommend to anyone!!! I personally loved the shot for 10 plus years no side effects to think of except a little weight gain but was fine with that because I was very skinny. But the weight kept coming and I have gained 90 pounds so far. My major side effects started 10 years ago_ but never made the connection to depo being the cause. I stopped 3 years ago to let my body rest and after I got my next shot 6 months later everything hit me with a vengeance. I just recently turned 40 and I thought I was going into early menopause. I am off the shot 7 weeks and suffered a severe withdrawal last week I was stuck laying in bed for 6 days with extreme fatigue_ severe depression_ very scary I wanted to end it all_ body aches_ night sweats_ slept for 14 hours at a time_ body acne_ smelly discharge_ no appetite and extreme anxiety. I feel a little better but still scared it might all return I do not have the strength to fight it. I am taking macafem and it has helped with the symptoms but I do not feel 100% yet and still feel very weak. This shot is a poison and evil because it has a way of masking itself and leads you to believe its not the cause. Please stop using this and find another b/c or do not ever consider if you are looking for a b/c. It will all catch up to you eventually_ not having a period is toxic to your body and can destroy your well being. Please say a prayer for me I really need some!!!

As well as this I do have occasional headaches although I'm not sure that is completely related.,I admit I didnt read too much about the shot before having it_ but fourtuneatly I havent found the side-effects nearly as bad as some people have said. I have always suffered from moodswings and being emotional but at some points I was suprised at myself and how much I would cry at nothing. I also have been very tired lately and found it very difficult getting up in the mornings_ even when its not even that early.

I had my period for 2 months straight when I first got on the shot. After that I only had it very lightly at the end of the 3 months. I have now been on it for 2 years and just recently started getting a heavy period for about 2 weeks now. I am still on the shot but if i continue to have this weird heavy menstruation I will need to get off of it. It will go away for like a day and then come back pretty heavy and it isn't normal period blood. It is thinner and really red like when you get a paper cut...! Up until now it has been good for me. I also got my period during sporting events but that is probably because the shot makes your uterine wall thinner and weaker....,F,17,2  years 1X D,7/6/2011Email,Depo-provera

Depressive moments. Sharp pains in my pelvic area every now and then that last up to 5 minutes. Slight hair loss. Muscle aches in arms. Bathroom problems. Losing motivation in what I use to be interested in.,When I first got the injection a year _ as my mum wanted me to since I started to go out with a older guy_ who I am now engaged to_ I got real sick about an hour after the shot. I have a server headache_ and felt like I was going to be sick. I felt like that for the rest of the day_ and I was soo tired. I eventually had a period every few months_ but mostly after a big event happened that stressed me out somehow. The period was light_ but lasted for about 2-3 weeks_ when it normally lasts 5 days. I use to weigh 63kg_ but now weigh 80kg (that is way to much) I now have acne problems. I am tired all the time_ I use to be able to stay awake till 4am easy_ but now I am struggling to make 10pm. I am constantly falling asleep_ which is not good as I am at Uni_ and can't afford to fall asleep in lectures_ which I have done too many times now. I get a sharp pain that shoots through my pelvis area every now and then_ which is uncomfortable_ they sometimes last up to 5 minutes_ and happen through out the day. I get upset more easy. Now since my last shot a month ago_ I have been having a headache every week on Saturday_ which generally is followed by the feeling of being sick_ which has happened. When this headache occurs_ it lasts all day. No pain killer can prevent the headache. Also when I have a headache_ all food is not appetizing_ no matter how hungry I am_ I try to force myself to eat_ but my body is almost rejecting it_ so I go a whole day without eating_ unless I ate before,F,17,1  yearsunsure 1X AN,7/2/2011,Depo-provera

I'm usually very capable of controlling my emtions_ but with this shot I'm a mess. I cry all the time over nothing whether its positive or negative. I'm also a very logical person but seem to have developed uncontrollable fears accompanied by anxiety attacks. I've also never really had acne_ even as a teen_ but seem to have developed it afer taking the shot. Nothing horrible_ but I do have acne all over now. I also have swelling in my hands and feet at least a few times a month. Nothing terribly painful_ but it does hurt mildly and becomes bothersome.Positive Effects: To speak to the positive_ I'm not pregnant_ so it did what it says it does. I also had no weight gain_ or headaches.Would I reccomend it? Probably not. Its really nice to just have one shot and forget about it_ but the effects aren't worth it.

645, 4, Birth control,just a little sleepy,I have been readind some of the comments and wonder if most of the women on here were completely healthy or have any family illnesses that the shot could trigger. Because I am very healthy only allergy I have is penicllin. It is rare for me to get side affects from anything I take so it could just be your family history or your health. If I were to get mood swings I would not let it distroy my marriage or loose my boyfriend because you have to learn to control your anger we are adults here you dont have to say what pops into your head if you know its going to hurt the other person. Weight gain I believe there is no way you are stuck being 20 or 45 pounds if you dieting and excercising. It makes no sense you are either not keeping up with excercising or overeating. The only thing I am worried about is the bone lost so I wont be on the shot for more than 3 years.,F,22,3  days 1X AN,6/11/2011Email,Depo-provera

Anyway_ I gained 20lbs. I was up to 145lbs. The heaviest I had EVER been. Then one day I was researching and I heard about all of the horrible weight gain stories. So....I stopped getting the shots and lo and behold_ I lost every bit of that 20lbs without even trying really. My normal weight is 125lbs and I am able to stay there without much difficulty. If it weren't for the weight gain_ this would be a great method because I didn't experience any of the other typical birth control side effects like I have with other things I've tried.,F,32,8  years 1X AN,6/8/2011Email,Depo-provera

I started having sharp pain in my whole abnomal area the pain was so intense that I coudnt get out of bad or walk and the heavy bleeding continued. I started feeling dizzy on top of that. So I finally called up my doctor and I explained the problem to him and he told me to go to the emergency room immediately. So I went to the emergency room and they said I lost to much blood after running tests. My hemoglobin was at 3.2. So I had to get blood transfusion done. They ruled out my heavy bleeding and was said that the lining of my uturus is to thick so my body kept shading the lining and that's why I have heavy bleeding and the depo shot was the cause of it.,Please don't use depo I almost died from it.,F,25,6  months 1X D,5/26/2011,Depo-provera
658, 1, endometriosis/adenomyosis,Extremely violent mood swings_ cramping increased_ increase in clotting,I took Depo once before in 2003. I experienced the same side effects so when my doctor suggested it_ I fought really hard not to get on it again. But she won...said that the severe mood swings were not a side effect_ maybe just a little depression but that's it. So figuring that it's been several years_ body has changed and my docotor has to be right_ I took it again beginning of April. Within a week I was going crazy again. Mood Swings_ Angery_ wanted to crush everyone and everything around me_ crying uncontrollable. Horrible cramping worse than before...huge blood clots. Decreased sex drive. Only thing good was decrease in bleeding_ even though I have bleeding for 2 weeks now. So my husband finally told me I need to call and get into see her right away. I went to see her...again this is not a side effect of depo. Has to be something else. Emotional Lability she called it. Put on antidepressants to see if that will conteract the violent mood swings. Then wants to switch to Depo Lupren in a few weeks. I don't want anymore hormones or injections! I will NEVER RECOMMEND OR TAKE DEPO again! And it really aggrivates me that no where does it have this as a side effect even though 90% of the women I have talked to in the last 2 months said that they felt the same way as I am when they were on on.,F,34,2  monthsinjection 1X O,5/25/2011,Depo-provera

660, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain_ Lowered libido_ headaches_ breast tenderness_ muscle soreness_ irritability_ major blood clots,I would not recommend this shot to anyone. I know with me I gained 45lbs during the time I took this shot. I would say may 10lbs was of my own doing because I could not control my hunger but the rest of it being from that shot. I have been holding out on my husband because I just feel no need fo sex which is odd. I have major headaches at least 3 times a week. Breast tenderness and I always feel sore and very very irritable like I wanna punch my husband in the face for no reason.. And major blood clots which made me think I was having a miscarriage. Dr's seem to think that its just me. But I went on diet and I work out 5 days a week. Hell Im in the military and am on verge of being put out just because I gained this weigh on top of other issues and I feel its making it hard for me to get my run to where it needs to be. DO NOT TAKE THIS ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO ANY MEDS. Ive been off this med for about a yr now and have been excercising regularly and eating more healthy and still have yet to loose this added weight.,F,21,8  monthsNormal Dos 1X AN,5/20/2011Email,Depo-provera

I started gaining weight_ crying uncontrolably_ having horrible mirgaines that would lasdt for days_ ot have weird shooting pains in my head. I had an MRI of my brain bc they were so often. I had no sex drive (being a newlywed this really upset my marriage) I stopped the shots in November 2010 and have not gotten my period yet. My doctor said that i might be three months after my last shot to get out of my system before I got my period. That was supposed to be February but nothing. Ive had alot of PMS symptoms off and on through out the entire time.

I've had Severe pain when in one position_ pain in my hips and knees would actually wake me in my sleep_ turning into a PSYCHO to the point I know I'm being nasty and I know I am but I can't even stop it no matter how bad I try_ severe rage for no reason or very little provoking. Its not even a period im getting its extremely painful and all it is_ is clots. Before when I was on it the weight gain was unreal almost fifty pounds after I stopped taking it it melted off so it wasnt my eating habits. my libido is gone and to be blunt I had NO issue with that before. The constipation is terrible and when I do go its painful_ it will get to the point my lower abdomen is pushed out. I cannot wait for this to flush out of my system. And I got two more miserable months to wait. I just don't understand why I had no symptoms before but now I do.,F,20,2.5  yearsreg. dose 1X O,5/15/2011Email,Depo-provera
667, 1, Birth Control,Fatigue_ Mood Swings_ Anxiety_ Back and Body Aches_ Weight Gain_ Digestive Upsets_ Acne_ Hair Loss,I started Depo Provera in Feb 1998 after the birth of my first daughter..For the first couple of years it was a micacle drug until I had my first panic attack which at the time I related to losing my father suddenly in 2001. As my moods progressively got worse my Doctor at the time suggested that I have Depo every 8 weeks..and take a daily dose of Zoloft. About 12 months ago my moods and panic got so severe that I couldn't even drive my daughter to school :-( About this time I changed doctors and the first thing discussed was the Depo and the effect it can have on mental health so in December 2010 I had my last shot EVER!! Im now undergoing extensive medical tests for hormone imbalance_ pituitary and adrenal glands_ blood sugars etc etc the list goes on and on...One month after my last shot was due Im slowly starting to feel a little 'normal again'. Oh and by the way I forgot to mention that I was 72 kg after my daughters birth and I now weight close to 100 kg :-(,F,32,13  years150mg 1X O,5/14/2011Email,Depo-provera

Call me crazy but i think it was great! I am only now going off it because I has been shown to decrease bone mass_ I am very active and haven't seen any signs of this but i have recently been diagnosed with scoliosis (crooked spine) which can be degenerative so I decided to try something else jussst in case. Im more afraid to try a new BC than to stay on this one. Wish everyone the best of luck but don't let these horrible reviews scare you.

I had these for 5 months till I had my first period then it all stopped.,During the time I was coming off Depo_ I was thinking I had something seroiusly wrong with me (Cancer or Kidney Failure). Almost weekly Urgent Care visits for pain and sickness. I had Ultrasounds and Cat Scans. My Dr's were stumped.

I thought it would be a perk to not get my period every month but instead Ive bled everyday for the past month. I have worse acne than Ive ever had in my life....even my scalp is breaking out! It hurts to have sex because of the vaginal dryness. Ive noticed that I've been EXTREMELY angry with everyone in my life for every stupid little thing. I feel like I have panic attacks that last all day. The convenience of not having to take a pill everyday just isn't worth the side effects. Its one of the worst decisions I've ever made.

My female doctor told me I was just tricked into thinking I was hungry and to stop eating so much. She didn't even ask to look at my food journals. My family physician said his average patients doubled their weight on the shot and that I should have never gotten the last shot since it is definitely not safe to be on for longer than a year. I was referred to a dietician who set up food classes and journaling for me. I ate between 1200-1300 calories a day_ low sugar_ 30g fiber_ low fat_ etc....did everything right and still GAINED. At the height I had gained a little over 80 lbs. After about a year I started coming down off the mood swings a bit and lost the first 20 lbs months after the exercise/food plan failed to work and I went back to normal activity/eating habits. 20 lbs in less than a month and a half. It is still gradually coming down and though I still have problems with my moods I am a LOT closer to who I was before I started getting the shots. I would not recommend it for anyone. Yes_ all other forms of birth control have given me problems either increasing migraines or weight gain_ so that was nothing new_ the HUGE mood and DRASTIC weight gain is what floored me. I had my daughter_ lost 80 lbs and was smaller than before I got pregnant. I started the shots and it was a sudden_ drastic gain that continued until after I stopped taking the shots.

The irregular bleeding is tolerable and an acceptable alternative to having kids in my opinion. The dryness is annoying but KY helps so that is tolerable as well. My sex drive was lowered a little but we're still quite active so no issues there. The hunger is  pretty severe. I gained 10 lbs the first month on the shot but have managed not to gain anymore. I eat all the time. I'm only 140 and flucuate to 135 every couple weeks. It's not awful but just a forewarn to any girls thinking about depo. I've become very anti-social and this is probably the worst part. Friends i used to hang out with all the time i dont feel like seeing quite as often. But I'm working on it. it's hard for me to leave the house to get groceries if my husband isn't coming with me.

It feels like I've got a stick up my butt. The pain I am feeling is excrutiating- level 10.  Midol_ Acetamephine and Ibuprofin are just barely masking my pain. I'm moody_ and have a headache. Visited the Doctor today_ though I considered an Emergency Room Visit because of the pain level.

This is torture!,I think all Doctors should provide a strong warning to patients about the possible side effects and most common patient complaints.  This medication was presented to me as a very probable cure for my menorraghia.  If anything_ my condition is now worse and not improved.

My only issues with it is my hair falls out more than normal and my acne gets really bad. The doctor told me it was because Depo doesn't give the body estrogen like the pill does_ so the acne and the hair thinning is more of a hormone issue than a Depo issue.

She presented as bipolar and schizophrenic.  She was paranoid and delusional.  Doctors believe it was the depo shot that caused it.  She was perfectly normal before the shot.  Two days later she was completely bizarre.  It is a horrible tragedy for this beautiful girl. (The age I put is hers),Her parents would like to hear from anyone with similar experience.

Also feeling so sad and down if I have no reason to and why can't I lose weight if I am exercising like I'm in the military (not a single pound!!!!!) I know its because of this drug.

I have no patience_ Im very irritable_ I cry over almost anything_ and I become extremely aggitated very easily. I at first couldnt figure out where these feeling were coming from.

733, 1, Migraines_ Cramping_ Heavy bleeding,I'm experience anything bad that could possibly happen. I often forget what I had just said or what I did 5 minutes earlier. I have hip pain and abdominal pain that's so intense it brings me to my knees. My hair is thinning out [I'm losing hair] and I have bled constantly for maybe 2 years.,When I started reporting my symptoms to my Dr. he said another shot might help. [The shot only worked for me for about a year and half] So of course_ him being your doctor_ you trust him and do what he says. Since then my health has depleted considerably. Once an active teenager_ [I'm 21 now_ started when I was 16.] I started sleeping all the time and not wanting to move. I'd just lay in bed for days because moving_ killed. So_ since they figured it was the Depo_ we did a series of other test that came back negative. Nothing was wrong with me_ except for the strange synthetic pumping through my veins. I just quit Depo this year_ and after reading all these comments I literally bawled. I feel bad for anyone who has suffered from this BC. After a CT scan they found a mass in my back on the left side_ right behind my uterus/ovary. Months later and they still dont know what it is or even exactly where it's sitting. I DO NOT recommend this for anyone. It's supposed to stop bleeding. That's the glamour of it. None of us like bleeding really_ but I've been bleeding for 2 years. Straight.

736, 1, Birth Control,Decreased sex drive_ Vaginal dryness_ weight gain_ and mood swings,At first it was great. I could have sex without a condom and I was having a very normal sex life. But then maybe 2 months into the shot I started bleeding while I was having sex. But that only lasted a couple of weeks. Then my last couple of weeks with the drug in my system I started having painful sex. Well it wouldn't hurt at first because I would be wet but then after awhile I would dry up and not be able to get wet anymore. It was very irritating for me and my boyfriend because we had to keep using lube when before we hardly ever had to use it. Now I have been off the shot for 2 weeks and I am now starting to have really bad cramps and increased urination and constipation. My period also hasn't come and I'm wondering when it will. I'm really hoping my sex drive comes back as well. Anyway I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone.,F,19,3  monthsDk 1X AN,2/24/2011,Depo-provera

738, 1, Birth-Control,Depression_ anxiety_ weight gain,So I have hesitated to post this but I realize if I stay silent it will not benefit anyone.  I had Depo-Provera injected into my body in 1994 after my first child and once the symptoms began I stopped taking it; basically I only received one dosage.  However this is such a toxic medication that I suffer to this day with problems that were created by taking just that one dose.  The best I have felt since then was when I was being treated by a Naturopathic Physician.  She took the time to listen to EXACTLY what I was complaining about and then compared by complaints with my lab work and treated me accordingly.  I thank God for her and for the treatment plan she placed me on.  Depo was never mentioned and yet through her LISTENING she was able to hit the target.  I was not 100% certain about the problems I have experienced since 1994 being related to the Depo until I found this website.

Personally I believe the nurse just botched it up. But I have been on this shot for 1 year now. I have unprotected sex FREQUENTLY_ and it most definitely works. My periods are a little off but until you realize you are NOT going to get pregnant_ you'll stress about it. When my shot's wearing off is when I have the most symptoms. I get extra turned on by the smallest things_ I get depressed sometimes and sort of needy_ sometimes small little headaches. Once I get the shot_ it's all cleared up! Besides the weight gain_ which is caused by being hungry once you get the shot. Every time I get the shot I have to remember immediately afterwards I'm going to think I'm SO hungry_ when in reality I should know I'm not. Monitor what you eat_ people. It's not so hard.

742, 1, Birth Control,Depression_ Anxiety_ Anger/Mood Swings_ Insomnia,It is 5 AM_ and I'm exhausted but wide awake in fear. I have only been on this for FIVE days_ and it is a nightmare!  I got the shot w/ great enthusiasm that a birth control lasts 3 mo.. the last I was on was the ring 5 years ago.  Also_ I took emergency contraception_ which the nurse said was a fine combo.  When she was going over side effects_ the only one which concerned me was the weight gain_ but she said_ all you have to do is control your eating_ as if no big deal.  I said I was on the ring before and a side effect was feeling a little emotional.. is this a side effect of this?  She replied_ well any time you alter your hormones in your body_ it could affect that_ but basically dismissed my fears and made it seem like that shouldn't be a concern at all!  The day after the shot_ I felt depressed_ didn't leave my room all day_ and cried twice.. I don't even know about what.  The 3rd and 4th days_ I experienced uncontrollable rage or snapping at people_ all over minor things.  I didn't even realize it at first either.  I told two friends.. and also said I felt concerned enough I should go talk to the doctor by 4th day (I didn't cuz I thought I was still OK).

743, 1, Birth Control,see previous review_ this is a continuation,(cont)I have been eating UNCONTROLLABLY (although this side effect I can perhaps attribute to a placebo effect_ as the nurse had mentioned it and I was concerned about it).  I have gained a solid 6 pounds already_ which is a HUGE change for me.  It's not that I necessarily would say I feel hungry.. it's more that I can't stop eating because I feel stressed.  Also_ I noticed I was gradually sleeping less each night.. waking up earlier and earlier in the morning_ but I didn't think it was insomnia or anything related to the shot.  Now_ on the fifth day_ I experienced the same anger during the day.  At around 12:30 am_ I lay down to sleep.  I can best describe the next 5 hours as a nightmare.. I felt unsettled and unnerved despite being exhausted from a long day.  A million thoughts were anxiously racing through my mind and I couldn't stop worrying.  Then_ I had what I can best describe as a nightmare while awake- a sudden thought in my head of me driving a car into a bus at full speed.  At that point_ I felt terrified.  My room is cold right now since it's winter_ but I was getting hot flashes.  I felt terrified_ helpless and 'crazy.'  Around 5 AM_ I couldn't take it anymore and started Googling side effects of Depo-Provera.  Knowing other people have these side effects_ however_ has not lessened how I feel right now.. if anything_ I feel very scared and alone..

As a person who has migraines with aura_ it was important for me to go on a non-estrogen birth control.  I'm too busy for mini-pills_ and after talking with my doctor_ I got my first Depo shot. I was very reluctant after reading about all of the weight gain_ mood swings_ and bone density loss.  My only other choice_ really_ was an IUD...An idea I wasn't fond of either.  Within three days of receiving the shot_ the two month long bleed-a-thon I experienced while on the Ring stopped and I've had light spotting only twice in three months.  I have gained no weight...in fact_ I think I've lost a little weight!  I've had no headaches_ and I can't blame the shot for my moodiness.  My libido has increased since coming off the Ring and I have natural moisture again.  The only negative side effect I've noticed is a tendency to bruise for no apparent reason.  I've always tended to be anemic_ so I'm hoping that increasing my iron and calcium will combat this problem.

I took a one year break about 3 years ago_ just to see if my body would ""act"" normal_ and it did. I had normal periods and was just fine. I just recently got engaged and now want start trying to have a baby after the wedding this year. So I decided to get off of the shot and get on regualar bc pills. I am experiencing sore breasts_ but thats it. The first 28 days I had a period for 3 days normal bleeding and im  on my second month now. So I would recommend this to people who dont experience the side effects. I have been lucky I guess_ because ive never gained weight_ never had mood swings_ never had acne and never had a lowered sex drive. I loved it while I was on it_ and although I might never go back on it after I finish having kids_ I would still recommend it to anyone who wants an effective bc that is easy to use.",F,29,11  years 1X D,1/17/2011,Depo-provera

I was attracted to the concept of 1 shot every 3 months. After the 1st shot_ my periods started getting lighter and eventually stopped. I had no cramping which was a wonderful plus; however_ after my 2nd shot_ I noticed a decrease in my sex drive. I had to start using lubrication_ but even with that_ halfway through intercourse I would be dry again. I eventually ended up completely losing any desire to have sex. I gained 8-10 pounds mainly due to the occasional heightened appetite. I waited a month before I received my 3rd shot to give myself a little break. After the shot_ I was on my period for 2 weeks and spotted off and on during the entire 3 months. My sex drive was non-existent and my poor boyfriend had to suffer. I finally decided to not receive a 4th shot which was supposed to be in late August 2010. 2 months later_ I thankfully had my sex drive back to ""pre-depo""; but_ I developed pregnancy symptoms (lightheaded_ nausea_ tender breasts_ etc) for months. I didn't receive a period until late October and it lasted for a month_ first with old blood_ then new blood.

Well on horrible night in December I had the worse panic attack in my life and it sent me to the ER. I have made several trips to the ER since but they just told me I was stressed. I have seen my doctor but they don't believe I am having withdrawal symptoms. REALLY? Well I guess they should visit all of the sites with unhappy patients who go on and on about how horrible they felt going off depo. I have seen a Therapist and they all just think I am depressed.

I am 2/3 into my first shot and just beginning to be on the irritable side.,I was on Seasonale for two years and started experiencing migraines every second day so my doctor advised me to go off_ I took a month with no birth control then went on Lo-Estrin. Lo-Estrin did not work for me at all. It took the migraines away but I gained weight and then bled through the whole time. I could not handle being irregular so I made a rash decision one morning and called my doctor to get the shot. The week after I had the shot I started to research it on the internet and came across hundreds of bad reviews of girls saying never to get the shot_ that it was the biggest mistake they could have made. Girls saying they gained 5-50lbs. that was not acceptable for me!Since I was paranoid about gaining weight I was watching what I was eating but VERY hungry. Being conscious of eating did not last long and I quickly forgot about the stories I read online. Looking back now I don¬ít believe I have gained anything (not including the 3 turkey dinners this holiday season)I would recommend depo_ I am yet to have any spotting_ no migraines_ no gaining_ no hair lossI guess I will see in the next couple months after my second shot if I am still satisfied but I cannot complain!,F,20,2  months 1X O,1/4/2011Email,Depo-provera

I always had a very balanced diet and when I went on this medication I experienced extreme hunger. I exercised as much as I could until I noticed that my chest began to hurt. I remember it was May and I had prom in June and I was freaking out because I had acne all over my back and face. I never had acne before this medication. I called my doctor and I was told that it was a dermatologists problem. So now it's August and I went to my doctor to get another shot. I got weighed and gained 30 lbs in under a year even with exercise. I spoke to my doctor and asked her why did I gain weight and why was I covered in acne? At this point in time the acne was down  to my wrists_ on my thighs_ chest_ back_ lower back_ neck_ scalp_ and it was going onto my stomach. Now I am off the shot and dealing with acne_ stretch marks (even though I lost weight)_ and depression.  If you notice acne or any side effect if that_ please get off this medication. I can't wear t-shirts or shorts even though I lost weight because of the severe acne. People ask me if I have hives or singles. To be perfectly honest I rather not take any pills at all and live with the consequences of my disease.

I was 46 and in excellent health otherwise.  Talk about being blind sided!  I truly believe that these two ""simple"" shots for birth control have been the cause of my cancer.

There's no consistency to what kind of flow (light_ heavy)_ it's unpredictable (prior to taking the shot_ I was never irregular with 3-4 day cycle). I have NO sex drive (which is also unusual_ I usually have a very high libido)... I barely even think about sex anymore. & with the constant bleeding_ My boyfriend and I both get really frustrated and rarely ever try to have sex anyway.

As of Friday_ 12/3/10_ she cannot walk at all and is now in a wheel chair.  CT scan with contrast_ lumbar puncture_ extensive blood work all came back normal.  She had MRI done yesterday_ EEG & more extensive blood work done Friday.  I suspect it will all come back normal if the Depo Provera indeed has caused her paralysis.  Today she woke up and can't swallow!!!  I am probably going to have to have home health care come in to help me take care of her_ as after 3 days of lifting her up from the couch_ to the wheel chair_ to the bathroom_ has abou",F,17,9  months 1X O,12/5/2010Email,Depo-provera
796, 5, Birth Control,Stable Mood_ Calm_ Peace of Mind_ No Period at all_ some weight loss_ more control over appetite_ happier_ less anxiety,I have taken depo for 10 years now. Most doctors say no one should be on it for this long. I move a lot over so I have been able to get a new doctor every few years. I had a bone density test_ no issues yet. I LOVE depo_ I haven't had a period in  10 years now except once when I was late for my shot and had to start my period again first. It took one month to have it again. I hated every second while I was off of it. I haven¬ít experienced any of the bad symptoms I hear about. I actually lost weight on depo_ never gained. I feel calmer and less emotional on it. I compare it to how men must go about life feeling. I feel it begin to wear off close to next shot time_ I start to get emotional. I feel so calm minded and happy within a few days of getting the shot again. Feeling like a normal girl isn't fun even in small doses. I know I need to go off of it someday soon because I am getting older_ and I fear not having a normal cycle for this long is not healthy. There is no medical evidence to suggest this_ but most holistic means tell you it matters and your hormones go out of balance impacting other aspects of health. So I will go off of it_ but I am extremely anxious about doing it. From what I hear_ my experience is rare and I am so thankful for the peace of mind I have enjoyed for so long with depo. I don't look forward to life without it.,F,28,10  years 1X O,12/2/2010Email,Depo-provera
797, 1, Birth Control,I took DP for 6 years and THOUGHT it was a dream come true.  When I decided to stop taking it_ my period did not return as expected.  Then monthly I began to experience VERY SEVERE abdominal pains periodically_ for about a week each time.  severe enough to go to the hospital 3 months in a row_ with no diagnosis.  Finally on my 4th emergency room visit and after a laparoscopy_ a determined OB-GYN finally diagnosed my problem as Retrograde Menstruation.  I was having a period and bleeding into my abdomen every month. He attempted to open my cervix but it closed within hours.  The final treatment was a complete hysterectomy.  The reason for my condition was that I took Depo Provera for more than 3 years.   Don't do it ladies.  Find a better way.  It was the most painful experience of my life_ and I have given birth and had eye surgery before.  Those don't even compare to the pain of the side effects of this drug.,It is a very dangerous drug.,F,40,6  years 1X O,12/1/2010Email,Depo-provera

I was 14 when i got on the depo and i am now 18.5 years old and just recently got off of it because of the horrid side effects and because my obgyn insists that i switch. now that i am off it(last shot was in august 2010) i now have worse cramps then i ever have before_ it can take up to 9mnths to get my period and clean out_ i am having vaginal pains_ my bones are so thin and frail is unbelieveable and my body is just messed up.

The first time was when i was 16_ and i was on it for a year. the first two months i was bleeding nonstop but i figured out if i took vitamin c tablets every day it went away in two or three days. The i started having mood swings and snapping at my ex (but to be fair this could be because he was an asshole). I stopped after a year when we broke up because i wasnt having sex and thus_ no need for it. Now im 18_ and i just got my first shot a month ago and the only side effect ive gotten is some backaches or headaches and cramps. They arent that bad and over all im very happy with this shot. I reccommend people trying it_ it works well for some_ and not for others. Everybodies body reacts differently and like me_ you might find a way to stop some of them.

Now that I am married (3 yrs yesterday)and decided to have a child I have been off the shot for 2 yrs and still my period has not returned. If it wasn't for my husband wanting a child with me (he has two teenage boys)I would probably still be on it. I really can't say that the shot is the reason I havent gotten pregnant yet.

I have not had a period in 2+ years and I do not think it is as hazardous as it is un-natural. I slowly gained 4 pants sizes and around 20 pounds since I had started the Depo shot_ but what worries me the most is I have gained 15 more pounds since I got off the shot in September of this year (a few months ago). My food craving is almost uncontrolable due to the fact I feel like I am never full_ my mood swings have made everyone think I am a totally different person than a few months ago_ my breast size has increased 2 cups along with sensitivity/pain and a lump with a tender sensation has developed and my doctor thinks it is a cyst (going for a second opinion & sonogram)_ fluctuating blemishes_ swollen upper abdomen_ I sleep 9+ hours a day_ and I have no sexual desire what so ever.

I suffered severe depression and mood swings the whole time I was on Depo. The doctors didnt give nearly enough information about the medicine.

I am noticing a difference this time in that I am getting the generic version of the shot so there may be something in that particular formula that is causing a few side effects.

836, 1, to prevent another pregnancy,oh my god how can i start i was using the depo provera because i dint want to get pregnant at the time since i already have 2 babies. i been using this injection for 2 years and oh my god i regret it. i was very happy at first because it got rid of my period completly. but after the last injection ive been feeling really sick and ended up going to the emergency room 3 times in less than 2 months. the pains in my joins are endless i have to take pain medications in the morning in the night and sleep with a botle of bengay next to me believe me is awfull. ive also lost 16 pounds in 2 months.believe me i wouldnt recommend this injection to my worst enemy. the worst part about this is that doctors dont give you all the information of the effects of this injection in order for you to make a more informed decision. you dont know how painfull these joint pains are sometimes the pain medication works and sometimes i just cant sleep because even with the medication im just in 2 much pain to jus,ive never been in so much pain like now after all these injections.and ive never taken so much pain medication like now. please dont put yourself at risk with the depo is not worth it.,F,29,2  years3 month in 1X D,10/9/2010,Depo-provera

Doctors can't find anything wrong and told me to stop drinking coke so I did and when I do I get terrible stomach aches_ chest pains_ belching_ which I never do_ and have been diagnosed with acid reflux which I have never had in my life.,The depo shot was great at first.

My stomach was saying that I wasnt hungry but my mind was telling me to eat..I guess this is partially what caused the weight gain. I went from 160 to 217 over the past 4 years.

In that 2nd week I began to bleed_ and it was more than just spotting. It was thick and dark brownish in color_ to the point that I had to wear tampons almost every day for the entire 1st 3 months. I suffered terrible migraines and cramps during my periods prior to getting the shot and havent had any problems since. Thank goodness. I do not miss those at all. My breast continued to be sore on and off again over the whole 3 months_ but other than the constant bleeding I don't have a problem with the shot. I have experienced a decrease in appetite and actually lost 12 lbs in the first 3 months. Was going to change methods this time but heard that the bleeding can get better after the first one is over. We'll see. I just got it today. If it doesn't get better and I dont stop bleeding_ then I will switch. Rather have my period one week a month than every week of every month.

Throughout my college years I_ got the shot. Then I started to wonder why there was little to no more recent updated information on this drug. So I started to take a break from it because my doctor could not give me much more information on how safe it was to continue to stay on it as long as I have. In between my breaks_ I would have terrible_ excruciating_ painful periods. They were so painful that I would have to stay in bed and cry because I was unable to move. Because of this pain_ I would always return back to the shot to avoid this. In 2006_ upon me graduating college_ I stop the shot. I did not want to not have a back up birth control so my doctor put me on some BC pills. I started the pills as prescribed. I got so sick from the pills: sore breast where I could not put my arms down_ could not sleep_ I developed a rashy acne in the form of a beard on my face. From this_ I had to start using Proactive and I have never had any skin problems in my life. I stopped the pills. I waited almost 6 months before I started the shot again. After the unbearable periods_ I just could not bear it anymore. I started the shot again. Since this_ I have been on the shot continuously. I finally decided again in May 2010_ not to get the shot ever again because no one can give any answers on the prolonged safeness of this drug.

I have NO periods or spotting with this shot_ which is really nice!,I haven't had any of the other side effects that most of the people have posted_ but I also was already taking Lexapro for anxiety_ so that might have helped me. Plus_ my doc started me on a Vit D/D3_ Calcium and Fish Oil regimen shortly after starting the shots_ so that may be helping with the muscle/joint problems. Honestly_ the side effects listed here are the ones I used to get with every kind of bc pill I used to take. I HATE bc pills and will NEVER go back on them... I think it all just adds up to your body chemistry and what works best for you. I think most women do best on some type of bc pill_ I just wasn't one of them... but as bad as they made me feel_ I wouldn't tell people to never take them... like I said it just depends on your body chemistry.

My summer has been ruined and my fibroid cyst did not decrease in size.  I have lost total trust in my doctor after going through this experience.  My doctor told me that I was allergic to the drug and couldn't take another shot.  Really?  I wouldn't take another shot anyway!  My side effects seem to be a common reaction to the drug_ not an allergic reaction.  I will never take another drug without doing my own research on it myself.

No side effects whilst I was on Depo which led me to think it was a wonder drug_ however as soon as I came off it (Sept 2007)I began to experience horrendous and very painful acne_ extreme fatigue and just general lack of energy - to the point where I was drinking about 6 cups of coffee a day just to keep my eyes open - constipation_ bloating_ excess facial hair_ awful back and joint pain and just a general aching feeling all over my body (I felt about 100 years old - I was 20) weight gain_ random chest pains_ complete and sudden loss of libido_ ridiculously erratic and painful periods (I think they returned about 3 months after I was supposed to have my next Depo shot)and the worst part was the mood swings - I was irritable_ insecure and completely paranoid about everything. Its been over 3 years now since I had my last Depo shot and although my problems have lessened they are still very much present and still affecting my life. I have been doing research on Depo and have been nothing short of horrified at what I have found_ I am so angry that this drug was and still is so widely available to all.

I noticed the emotional instability immediately after taking depo but attributed it to the events at the time. Every time I was due for a shot I got extremely emotionally unstable. My husband joked that depo worked by making me not want to have sex. I gained about 20lbs (on top of already being overweight) and had no periods the first year on depo. I then decided to lose weight and worked really hard and lost 75 lbs over 2 years_ and now I'm back to being extremely athletic and active but was hoping to lose the last 20lbs extra I have on my body (which seems to be all around my mid section and base of my extremeties) now that I just stopped my injections. After about 1 1/2 years on depo I began to get my period a week before my shot_ then 6 months ago I got two periods_ one week apart before my shot. I was due for a shot two weeks ago. In the last eight weeks I had 4 periods(every other week). After reading posts I believe my tendonitis might aslo be from depo_ and not ""inadequate stretching"". I'm not looking to get pregnant but I'm sick of feeling like a chemical inbalanced mess_ I feel like I have been noticing more and more negative symptoms now that I weigh so much less!

The stretch marks have gotten much worse_ to the point where I cannot wear a bikini to the beach which is very disappointing.

I have tried using cocoa butter and Mederma to treat my stretch marks but I desperately hope that once I change my birth control the stretch marks will calm down and the theraputic lotions that I use will have a greater effect. I do not suggest this type of birth control and I personally feel stupid for taking it. I have been on depo for about a year and I'm 19. I wish I wasn't as against pills but the shot is given too much credit in regards to my personal opinion that I formed from my experience.

Proper HEAVY bleeding_ clots and all.Initially I was in less pain than I would have been prior to having the shot_ but by day 10 of the bleed_ my pain was increasing more and more to a point where I was having to take the same old regimen of painkillers as I had done prior to the depo.Eventually the bleeding pettered out after 11 days_ but I am left with constand and really bad pain in my pelvis_ in the same 2 locations I have always experienced pain_ and despite the fact the bleeding has stopped I am still on high strength painkillers for this pain and I don't know when it is ever going to stop.I also have a lot less ebergy than usual; I was running 20k a day on my crosstrainer but now I struggle to stand up from the setee without a wave of lightheadedness hitting me.The bleeding has caused me to go anaemic again (so much for light to non-existant periods!!) I also had the most unbalanced mood swings about a week prior to_ and during_ my 11 day bleed_ ranging from feeling suicidal to teary_ angry_ all very negative.I wish I had never had th,F,33,6  weeks 1X O,6/16/2010,Depo-provera

I did and with calcium supplements and excerise my bone density test have come back normal.  I have put on a few pounds but considering I started the shot at 22 and am now 36_ I attribute the small weight gain to age_ not eating healthy and not excersing as much.  I do sweat more and noticed the increase sweating within a year of starting the shot so I don't know if the two are related_ but it makes since that they are.  However_ I haven't noticed anyone else mention an increase in sweating.

As of 6/3/10_ it's been three months since I started bleeding_ and there's no sign of it letting up.

951, 1, birth control,no period for three years_ vaginal tissue was destroyed_ initial penetration was enough to put me in tears and tear me inside_ frustration,I was on depo for three years.  my sex drive gradually decreased during this time.  Also_ sex started to become painful.  It ended up so bad that I would be torn inside after anything went in there. My last shot was due in July of '09.  I decided not to take it_ thinking it might be the lack of periods causing it.  My OB took one look inside and said my vagina looks post-menopausal.  I am 26.  He prescribed estrogen and it helped a little initially_ and then it stopped helping.  The thought of sex puts me in tears.  I'm a newly wed and cant enjoy it because of this nasty piece of medicine.  I still haven't had a normal period and we wanted to try for a baby soon...  I have an appt. with the OB (6th one since quitting depo...) on thursday.  I'm going to request the pill to see if it will kick start me into a regular cycle_ which would hopefully mean more natural estrogen to aid my poor vag at least.,F,26,3  years 1X O,4/27/2010Email,Depo-provera
952, 1, Birth Control,Anxiety (paranoid)_ depression_ mood swings,I started taking the depot shot when I was a teenager. I have been off and on the drug since. Though it is worth mentioning that I have only been off it a total of 2 years in the entire ten years I used it. The first time I went off it it took about 4 months for my period to come back. It was only slightly more uncomfortable than I remember. However_ I am now in my late 20s and I know that I need to take better care of my body if I want to have babies some day_ so I have been off the shot since August 2009. Mind you_ this is when I would have been due for my next shot. It is now going into May 2010 and I still have not had a period. I fear that I may have done damage to my fertility! This drug should be marketed as a short term solution not a long term method of birth control. No one should be on this for more than six months. I am relieved to know that I am not alone. As women we should speak out against these horrible drugs. I thought I was the only one with anxiety and depression from birth control. It's the big elephant in the room! Remember when post partum depression wasn't a common conversation topic? Now it's common knowledge! Let's bring these issues to the forefront of our health care! If we don't we will continue to suffer in silence.,F,26,10  years 1X AN,4/26/2010,Depo-provera

955, 1, To prevent pregnancy,After recieving the shot_ I became very depressed. I have no sex drive at all_ and I cannot get aroused. Me and my boyfriend had been together for a year before I got the shot and our relationship was great_ not perfect but pretty close. And now we aren't together because of how depressed I am. I get mad at him for absolutely nothing. I feel justified in the moment but then when I think about it later I realize how irrational it was. I've completely stopped hanging out with friends I used to hang out with on a daily basis_ I sleep every chance I get because I am so incredibly tired all the time. I've hadsevere back and knee pain. I never really thought that the shot was the cause of these problems_ but after reading all the stories about the negative side effects I'm pretty sure depo has caused these issues. The one good thing about depo is that it does prevent pregnancy. A birth control that lowers your sex drive_ whats the point in that?

958, 1, Contraception,Bleeding almost constantly since about 2 weeks after my first injection_ sometimes quite heavily and with bad cramps. Anxiety_ depression_ moodiness_ tearfulness_ almost felt hysterical at times - this has caused me to have to take time off work as I felt incapable of doing my job when I would burst into tears for no reason_ and I've felt lower than I ever have_ but haven't been able to put it down to anything going on in my life.,Do not have this poison injected into you! I had my first jab in December 2009_ after trying a few different forms of the pill and finding that none of them agreed with me (either tearfulness/anxiety or bleeding before I finished the pack). I had previously had Depo when I was 18 or 19_ and found that it stopped my periods_ but was hell when I came off it. I bled pretty much solid for six months when I stopped it the last time I tried it. This time_ I knew I wanted contraception for a few years and knew my experiences of coming off it wouldn't happen again for quite some time_ so I decided to try Depo again. How wrong was I?! I started bleeding a couple of weeks after my first jab four months ago and haven't stopped apart from maybe 2 weeks during that time. Emotionally I've gone through hell too_ feeling like I was cracking up and unable to go to work for a couple of days because I felt so hysterical one minute and so low the next.I can't wait for this to get out of my system; I've read it will take at least 6 months. There is no way of getting it out of your system any quicker_ it's not reversible if your experience of depo is as hellish as mine. Think very carefully about having this_ even if a previous experience of Depo was okay_ it seems it affects your body differently as you age_ as well as it affecting different people in different ways.,F,27,4  months 1X AN,4/11/2010Email,Depo-provera

966, 1, birth control,After a year and no periods. I began bleeding so bad I couldn't go out. (For fear of bleeding through my jeans.) At which time my ob/gyn recommended an endometrial ablation. Which meant more than likely no more children. So_ a little over a year after the ablation I am being told I might need a partial hysterectomy. It seems the ablation can cause scarring resulting in pain. There is no way to stop bleeding like that from depo to my knowledge. I feel if I would have never taken depo then no ablation would have been needed which means no hysterectomy. I would strongly urge women to consider other options. Please note that I was breastfeeding while on depo because it appeared to be the safiest for my son.

I have had some very light periods but I don't feel like I know my body anymore.  I sometimes think I am going mad_ I find it harder to be friendly (I'm a bubbly and friendly person normally) and I feel like since I've been taking this drug I'm self-conscious_ insecure and uptight_ and much more annoyed in general! I hate being so horrible and moody; I am not going to go back for my next injection this month - I want to flush out these hormones and be myself again_ and hopefully lose the weight!,F,26,9  months 1X D,3/4/2010,Depo-provera
983, 1, birth control,It turned me into a different person_ angry ALL the time! Definitely my biggest complaint would be the moodiness. I had to withdraw from school and wait for the side effects to pass because I was furious with everyone and all I could focus on were violent_ terrible thoughts. I am normally a completely peaceful person! Other side effects included no period (which is the one good thing!)_ headaches_ and bad acne/really greasy hair.,I wish this shot would work because not having a period and not having to worry about birth control except once every three months would be great! But after looking over the other comments I don't seem to be alone in having an awful experience with the drug. Another thing to consider when trying this drug is any possible side effects experienced last three months!

984, 3, birth control,Light spotting when close to time for next shot.,"I have been on depo i think longer than anyone who left a comment. i am 30yrs old and have been on it for 11yrs. i've never experienced any problems with it but now i believe it is causing some of my health issues. i never had weight issued until last year so i think its starting to work against me. i was only around 115 pounds when i started now after 11yrs i'm 150 and pushing it! i find i very hard to lose the weight. my legs hurt when i run and i never thought it had anything to do with the shot until i read someone else's comment. my arms are very weak and shirts are tighter in the arms. i have an appointment this week and am planning to get off the shot and let my body rest. i was told last yr that after 10yrs i need to start taking calcium b/c it could effect my bone density but after reading up on it its not recommended to be on it over 2yrs unless you ABSOLUTELY have no other options due to the ""black book warning"". i recently had a colonoscopy b/c i was having issues with bowel movement but it came out ok. i have headaches more often than i think is normal and lately i've been very tired and borderline depressed. i dont know for sure if the depo caused all of this but i never had these problems before. weight is sitting mostly on my inner thigh and mid section and i get tired easily when i used to be very energetic:(",F,30,  1X O,3/1/2010Email,Depo-provera

My doctor thought it would be good to start the depo because it would be a great chance with it stopping my periods they wouldnt return. The first shot I felt sick to my stomach and just not myself. Second shot I started to notice the same thing sick to my stomach and just not feeling well. My friends and family commented on my mood swings which I started to notice myself along with horrible back pains_ my hair was falling out_ acne became horrible_ headaches and joint pain. Third shot sent me over the edge! I became so moody for no reason at my boyfriend or anyone who looked at me wrong. I started have anxiety attacks and thinking crazy and crying for no reason. My doctor said it didnt agree with me and started me on anxiety and depression medications.

This stuff has been toxic to me_I have wanted to die the last three months_and I have everything to live for. I am not me anymore and I am angry because I did some research and the medical establishment just downplayed my fears and assured me the only true possible side effects were loss of a period and weight gain. Maybe for a small segment of women_ but it has been a nightmare for me. Instead of a week of cramps and a week of bleeding_ I get a month of cramps and mood swings and 3 to 4 weeks of bleeding. Their solution is to keep getting the shots until the periods stop.Never mind my pre existing depression_bipolar_and anxiety have me near a break down when I was doing well postpartum before the depo. My stepmom gripes that they took her off the depo and she loved it_so it does work for some_ but for those like me who were ill advised and mislead_ this stuff is poisonous. I'm not getting another shot_ever_ and I personally think with this many bad side effects it should be taken off the market.At the same time_ it has been a life saver for some.

I used to be one of those people that thought eh reviews are reviews theres no chance anything will happen to me...I'm 19 years old and my boyfriend is in the marines so I hardly see him enough as it is. So I thought the shot would be perfect because I wouldn't have to take a pill or anything cause Im bad at taking pills. I got the shot December 9_ 2009. Everything was fine until christmas day. Everything started going downhill. My period started which I thought wasn't a big deal because it was to be expected and is the most common side effect. Well my period was a monster and I used to have bad cramps before but this shot my cramps 3 times worse. Then I started getting dizzy spells out of knowwhere. After a week the bleeding went away and then IT CAME BACK! It came back the second week of January and I've been bleeding ever since (today is Feb 26) so I've been bleeding non stop for about two months! And I've had the worst stomach pains and cramps of my life. As of now I'm still extremely dizzy_ still bleeding_ leg cramps_ HORRIBLE MOOD SWINGS! I can cry at the drop of a hat over anything. My acne was starting to clear up before the shot but I think it has gotten worse since I started the shot. The only up side is I haven't gained any weight at all BUT it is impossible to lose weight on this drug.

I liked that I didn't have periods on it_ it's very inexpensive_ and you only have to think about it once every 3 months.  However in the 4 years I was on it I gained 40 lbs. and I have no doubt it was the Depo's fault.  Not only did I gain weight_ it was IMPOSSIBLE to lose until I went off of it even with dieting and exercise.  I went from a size 5 to a 12_ which is just ridiculous.  I had absolutely no sex drive.  So if that's the ""birth control"" it offers....  LOL!  The once a month bloating was terrible.  Made my jeans fit even tighter_ thus depressing me.  The final straw was the pregnancy symptoms I got.  Breast tenderness_ mood swings_ and morning sickness.  I wasn't pregnant but I sure felt it!  I'd never recommend this to anyone.  It also depreciates the calcium in bones_ which I think is reason enough to have it pulled off the market since it is for women.

I always noticed that once in a relationship about 4 months in my sex drive would disappear. i always related it to just getting use to the relationship but the other constant would be the depo shot within the first 2 weeks of a new relationship. i figure that might contribute to my lack of libido 4 months into a relationship after the drug has had time to have its affect. also panic attacks. i wasnt sure what was causing them but i seem to have anxiety issues and had a panic attack where i had to get up and start running and actually drank a glass of wine to help me calm down. but this is after being off the shot for 8 months. i have now been off the shot for going on 10 months and I have yet to get my period back. i would love to get back to normal and feel normal again_ but my period doesnt seem to be on its way.,F,24,5  times,1/22/2010,Depo-provera

I never considered what I was putting into my body before getting the depo shot- I loved the idea of not getting a period and it never occurred to me that I was more or less putting my body through menopause. I would not recommend for ANYBODY to take this drug as a form of birth control because it does not outweigh the side effects_ plus I've heard that 30% of people still get their period while on the shot which indicates that they are still ovulating (and can get pregnant). I gained 12 pounds within 2 months_ my panic attacks and depression got so bad that I had to go to the doctor to get all kinds of pills to help me deal with myself until this stupid shot wears off. I feel like I lost my mind on the depo shot. I only got the shot one time and I will  NOT be going back for my next one. Some websites about the shot say it can take 14 weeks to wear off and others say side effects can linger for 6-8 months after getting it. The synthetic hormones in the shot store in your body tissue so if you are desperate like I am to get it out of your body_ drink lots of water_ exercise_ eat raw organic vegetables_ and consider going to a health food store to buy herbal remedies to help detoxify your body. Please_ please_ please reconsider before getting the depo shot- it is not worth it! It is natural for your body to have a period and drugs are not the answer to try and make it go away.,F,21, ,1/22/2010,Depo-provera

I didn't know any better_ so I got the shot.  Within mere days I was weeping uncontrollably over virtually nothing! Massive mood swings began after that_ gained 15 pounds in less than a month and then began having severe** panic attacks day and night.  I honestly thought I was going insane.  I had no idea how long it took for this drug to get out of your system!! I asked my doc and he said a couple of months! BS! I did research and found that it can take up to a year before it leaves your system.  After 6 months I saw a psychiatrist who put me on antidepressants and anti-panic drugs.  He diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and it took me years to realize my problem was this HORRID DRUG! Finally after 12 YEARS_ I got off antidepressants and am still weaning off klonopin for panic prevention.  I was too scared to stop the drugs to treat the problems caused by this toxic substance.  I advise NOBODY to take this junk!! I was so relieved when a new psychiatrist told me he thought my mood problems were largely hormone related.,F,48,1  times,1/15/2010,Depo-provera

After reading all the other comments I am scared to get of the shot because of the seide effects that can occure. I wish I new before or I would have picked another method.

I had my last Depo shot_ May 2009. Up until then_ I was fine. The 4th shot changed everything. I was constantly at the doctors. All they could find was high cortisol. I was sent to an Endocrinologist. She said all of my symptons were 100% because of the Depo. I started to feel better mid November. I was put on bio-identical hormones to trick my body back. I got my period on January 2nd and it was completely normal. I do not recommend Depo to anyone.One of the doctors I saw told me he would not give Depo to his dog. It messes with the hypothalmus.

1029, 1, Birth Control,Massive weight gain_ increase in appetite_no periods.,I gained 21 pounds in weight and it was all in the wrong places!! I felt bloated and was hungry all the time. I watched my weight creep up every time I had a check up and the Depo.  I came off the Depo in March. Since September 09 I have lost 21 pounds_ my periods returned and I am my usual slim self_ I have joined a slimming club where you have green days and red days!! and I have increased my CV work at the Gym to increase my metabolic rate_ I believe that all these three factors have helped me to return to a normal weight.  I have been to hell and back with the effects of this injection as I became very depressed due to gaining weight and I thought that my partner would leave me at some stage!! My friend at work told me I would lose the weight after six months and that support kept me going. I was never told how much weight I would gain and I was never given proper guidance or support when I was given this injection. I would advise any woman not to have this injection as it causes no end of problems and these are irreversible until months later.

I'm always upset or angry about something now_ and before i was usually happy or content the majority of the time. I'm still on the first shot and have been bleeding heavily for about two weeks now. Also_ i have been getting constant headaches every day. Finally_ i get to the appetite change_ I don't eat more_ i eat less.

The suicidal feelings made me leave my mediaction in the hands of my partner..scared to have it with me. Scared of socialising...and before this injection i had been better for 2 or more years.

The other side effects I could do without. I went off the shot about 12 months ago_ my cycle still isn't normal_ one month I will get my period like 2 times_ other months I don't get one at all_ or it's only like 1 day. I am 28 and went off the shot so that I could start a family soon_ I guess it was a little more long term than I thought..keep that in mind if you are deciding to use this. I don't have a normal cycle yet but I do get all the symptoms associate with it like moodiness_ pretty bad lower back pain_ etc. If you are on it or are planning to take it remember there are other options that are less long term and that do not mess with your body's natural cycle.,F,28,6  years,1/3/2010Email,Depo-provera

1034, 1, Not sure Why,Head aches_ server back pain_ server cramping and stomach pain_ nausea_ bleeding....DO NOT GO ON THE DEPO....i was on the pill at one point and never got any side effects...on this i got many! What sucks more is i will probably be in pain for the hole 3 months..its only been 2 weeks and its already effecting my love life and work life. I will never get this shot again and dont reccomend it to anyone. I am also very upset that my dr did not discuss w/me anything about the shot. If he had i would have told him rigth away to put me on the pill. i would have been able to control how long i took it then so instead of 3 long months plus possible more if it dont leave my system right away. I could have taken the pill just until my leavels were back to normal...DO NOT GET THIS SHOT!!!,I had gotten pregnant last april and made it till 22 weeks(which was sep.) and at that time i had had a still born. I never actually got another menstrual cycle and in late november i found out i was pregnant again. Shortly after i was told that again it would be another miscarrage. I had a dnc done and while recovering my fiance advised the dr i was against going on the shot but right when i got back from recovery they gave it to me anyways. I guess they thought it would help lower my hormone leavel which i guess was important at the time. but im sure other froms of birthcontrol would have been just as effective and could have been easaly stopped after my levels have gone completly down_ but now i have to waite even longer. After that not even a week later i exsperianced alot of pain especially in my back and stomach. i went to urgent care and they werent sure what the pain was from so just put me on pain medication and sent me on my way. A few days later i was back again_ and again was given muscle relaxers(which did not take sence could not function on them) and another pain medication which did not work. I now know from looking up the shot that my problems are from it. I am very upset that dr put me on this form of birthcontrol sence he knew i would want to try again right away to get pregnant. but now will have to waite awhile plus have to deal w/the pain which is hard when i am a waitress and on my feet 5 days a week.,F,24,2  weeks,1/3/2010Email,Depo-provera

1036, 3, Contraceptive,Progressive weight loss.  Loss of libido_ dryness contributing to loss of libido.  Initially heavy bleeding for first 3 weeks_ then no period or on rare occasion spotting. I used to have bad PMS_ so having no period helped control my mood swings.,My problem is not with being on Depo_ but when I decided to come off it.  I'm one of the unusual tiny percentage that actually lost weight on depo.  I was on it for 2 years_ and by the end of the 2 years I lost about 8 or 9 kilograms!  I did not change my eating habits or appetite_ nor did I increase exercise.  I was taking no other medication so can attribute the weight loss to the depo.  I thought this drug was a god-send with regard to having no periods and much better moods.  However_ I when I decided to come off the injection I suffered some uncomfortable symptoms.  After the first missed injection (3 months after the last one) and progressively over the past 12 months since my last jab I have gained back weight no matter how hard I try to keep it off.  I still have not had a period_ however do have pms-like symptoms every month including bloating_ tender breasts_ headaches_ back ache and insomnia - however no period follows all these symptoms!  I understand it takes up to 18 months and sometimes 24 months for fertility to return.  It has been just over a year and still no period!  I'm almost tempted just to go back on depo to lose weight again.. but really want fertility to return so I can start a family soon!  I guess my overall comment is that as a contraceptive it is extremely effective.  A bit too long term though!  Hard to gauge how one's body will react to getting rid of the chemical over time and how long it'll take for fertility to return.,F,27,2  years,12/30/2009,Depo-provera

I'm finally on a low estrogen pill. I was a happy person up until getting this shot.  Gaining 20 lbs is just one of the motivations for getting off depo.  In addition_ I became moody and mean often(especially with my husband).  Also lost my sex drive COMPLETELY.  Hope these side effects will go away soon as I've only been off depo for a few weeks.

The first year I would bleed and spot for 45 days then no period for 45 days.  It was horrible.  After a year_ I would only have my period every 6 months or when I had high stress.  My hair thinned out.  I gained 25 pounds in 5 years.  I would have all the symptons of PMS (moodiness_ breast tenderness_ appetite change_ fatigue)every month but not actually have a period.  I also have had 8 cavities in the last 5 years.  I had never had a cavity in my life until 6 months after being on depo.  I actually have mineral deposits on my teeth which strengthens them.  I drink milk take supplements and I brush and floss my teeth two times a day but still I get cavaties.  Now I am getting off of Depo.  It's been 6 months.  At 3 months I spotted_ but now I have a period with heavy bleeding last more then 4 days.  I used to bleed heavily before I was on Depo but it only lasted a day or so.  I'm not sure if that is suppose to be a side effect.,F,22,5  years,12/26/2009,Depo-provera
1039, 5, switched after takin pill for 4yrs,Decreased sex drive,I switched to the depo shot after taking the pill for 4yrs_ I didn't like having to remember to take a pill everyday and I liked the idea of not having a period. I've been on it for 5 and a half years_ I don't plan on getting off it anytime soon. I haven't had my period at all the whole time I've been on it_ no spotting either. I love it. The doctor told me that the people who expierence lots of bleeding and awful side effects that its because its not working the way it was designed to_ it just doesn't work right for some people_ everybodys different and its working out great for me! Only bad thing for me is the decreased sex drive but its dealable_ I have a busy life and don't have a lot of free time anyways and I like to get a full nights worth of sleep.

1040, 4, ,I have been on depo for the last 8 years.  About 3 years ago I took a break because of the bone density but the test came back normal.  Just recently I came off of depo because I was married and my husband wants to start a family.  I have a 9 year old son and we are wanting one more child.  I got on depo because I had the most awful cycles and I cramped so bad I had to miss days of work.  I really enjoyed the no menstruals.  My Dr. did say that after coming off that it could take up to a year to become pregnant_ which is around the time we are plannig on conceiving.,My Dr. told me the first time I got off of Depo that I needed a form of BC to regulate my cycles again_ so I got on the patch.  I had regular_ lighter cycles without issues so I couldn't complain.  I just came off 2 months ago.  I haven't had my period yet bc I haven't started my new bc patch so I will see how that goes when I begin my bc on Sunday.  The only issues that I have had when off is the swollen_ sore_ itchy breast.  It really is a pain and it hurts to touch especially when taken off my bra.  I think this is one of the reasons I stayed on for so long because when I missed shots it would happen.  I also recently have gained about 30lbs even when killing myself in the gym it will not come off_ so I am looking forward to getting back in shape.  Would I take depo again after conceiving probably.  I really did like it_ but I know I can't stay on it forever.  IUD is really not an option for me_ I hear the side effects are sometimes worse than the product.,F,27,8  years,12/23/2009Email,Depo-provera

I was on the shot for 3 years with no problems_ my doctor told me it wasnt reccomended to recieve the shot more than two consecutive years and that i should consider switching to a new method. So it was back on the pill_ shortly after_ while on the pill_ i became pregnant with my 2nd child. After she was born i insisted i be put back on the shot since it seemed to be the only method that works and it was just a bonus that i had no period. That was 2 years ago_ and I am still on the shot now but have recently noticed over the past year my body has felt like its falling apart. I feel very weak_ and achy_ my skin is very sensitive_ ive had major hair loss_ my weight is at a halt and no matter what i do eat healthy_ eat junk_ are active or do nothing_  its at a stand still. I've had horrible pains in my ankles_ knees_ and wrists. It hurts to walk down the stairs_ sometimes i cant even hold my 30lb child because i am so weak. I always blamed this on bad diet_ not enough vitamins and what not_ but the more i read into depo_ the more im starting to believe that im not falling apart_ the depo is destroying me!

1050, 1, ,I just gave birth in September_ & on my postpartum check-up_ I wanted to go on any form of bc that is really good. So my Dr. prescribed the depo..After 2 weeks_ I started to notice back aches & anxiety attacks_ I didn' t know that it was anxiety_ So the first time that I had it_ I panicked because I had shortness of breath_& went into the ER.I did all kinds of tests; scan_heart ultrasound_ x-ray_ Ekg..& to my surprise_ they all came out normal.The doctor told me_ I don't know whats the problem here_ but everything seems to be normal.It must be anxiety that you're having. I was so shocked_ because I never thought I would go through such a thing!So I did a follow up at my regular doctor the next dayand she told me that it was the depo shot that caused my anxiety_ so I'm not going to take that anymore. Up until now_ I still have shortness of breath & I get startled easily. I've gone to a therapist_ but it doesn't seem to be working_ I,Do not take this shot!,F,19,1  months,12/9/2009Email,Depo-provera
1051, 3, Painful periods,Acne_ 60 lb. weight gain_ moody_ depressed_ absolutely no sex drive_ loss of period (happy about that one),I got my first shot in April 2008 because my period got so bad I was willing to try anything to stop it.  No doctor will perform a hysterectomy because of my age so I tried the shot.  It worked_ I never had a regular period after that.  I would have spotting but that's it.  Now_ 9 months after my last shot I still have not had a period.  I stopped getting the shot because I gained 60 pounds.  My poor husband has stood by me the whole time even though I know it's been miserable for him because of me not desiring sex at all.  We were both miserable.  My sex drive is still low but it's better than what it was.  I developed another symptom early in 2009 but I'm not sure if it is because of the Depo or not.  I began having these tics and was referred to a Neurologist who thought that it could perhaps be Adult-onset Tourette Syndrome but now he's thinking Dystonia.  I'm supposed to see a Movement Disorder Specialist later this month to see if they can come up with something.  Has anyone else had anything like this happen?,F,27,1  years,12/8/2009Email,Depo-provera
1052, 5, period control /  birth control,none,"i took depo for 15 years - from the age of 15 to 30 years old.  for me it was the wonder drug - i had no side effects and no period for 15 years.  i maintained a weight of 100 pounds the entire time and was so happy.  a year ago_ my obgyn sent me for a bone density scan_ and it showed that i have the bones of a 90 year-old woman - very frail and brittle.  she demanded that i get off the shot immediately in order to reverse the loss.  i was on the nuvaring during the last year_ which has sent my weight to a whopping 150 pounds_ which at 5'4"" is ludicrous_ considering i have gained half my previous weight and now weigh 1.5 times what i used to.  i no longer recognize myself_ both physically and internally - just don't feel right_ don't feel like myself.  i had a mirena iud inserted last week in order to get my body back to the condition it was in during the depo_ so i am currently hopeful.  had my doctor not refused to continue giving me this shot_ i would still be on it.",F,31,15  years,12/7/2009,Depo-provera

1054, 1, birth control and regulate periods,headaches_ decreased appetite but weight gain anyways..muscle and joint aches_ irregular bleeding_ bad cramps_ heavy bleeding,worst form of bc EVER! idk where to begin..this is the first bc ive ever taken and my doctor told me that it would eliminate my period and i wouldnt have to take a pill every day. I got a bruise on my arm from the shot but thats the least of the side effects..before this shot i rarely got headaches and considered myself lucky but during the 9 months they were atleast a couple times a week id say. For the first 2 months i didnt have a period which was great_ and then about 10 days before i was supposed to get my next shot my period started and didnt stop until i got the next shot. Before getting depo i never had cramps either_ but on it i would get cramps where id be doubled over in pain and just couldnt even move until it was gone. The blood was more of my uteran lining then blood which worried me because it was never like that before. after the 3rd shot i decided not to get it anymore because instead of not getting a period like my doctor said_ i would have it for 2 or 3 weeks at a time. so to answer the question if it works as a birth control_ the answer is yes_ because you never get the chance to have sex except one lucky week a month MAYBE. ive now been off of it since Nov 11 (now Dec 7) but have had irregular bleeding/spotting since about the first week of Oct. I can't go anywhere w/o pads. Now that i'm off it my stomach seems to feel and look a little flatter even though the scale reads the same..NO i would NOT recommend this product,F,18,9  months,12/7/2009,Depo-provera
1055, 1, Contraception,Acne_ oily skin & hair_ vaginal dryness_ night sweats_ numbness/tingling in hands & arms when sleeping_ swollen breasts_ weight gain around the waist,"I got oily skin & acne from the start_ assumed it would settle down but it never did. After the 5th injection the other side effects suddenly got a lot worse so I decided to stop taking depo. A year & a half after my last injection my periods are only now getting back to normal (I had them about every 2 weeks for 9 or 10 months). I also have swollen breasts & discomfort in my upper arms & legs due to swollen glands for the past 5 months. Thankfully the other side effects are gradually wearing off. Before I got my first injection I was told it could take ""up to a year"" for the depo to get out of my system_ that my bone density could be affected through prolonged use & that my periods would most likely stop while taking it. I was not warned of any other possible side effcts. I've also had a sore throat that flares up every few weeks & leaves me feeling exhausted by evening; I don't know if it's connected to the depo but it started a few weeks after my first injection...the doctor says it's a low grade virus that my body has been unable to shake off.",F,30,15  months,12/6/2009,Depo-provera
1056, 5, To prevent pregnancy,No or minimal periods. It helped reduce my cramps when I had a period.,I seen all of these negative comments about Depo and I thought it was strange that I didn't have any of the mood swings or anything. I liked not having a period and no cramps. The only things I don't like is the possability of bone loss(the main reason I stopped taking it) and not being able to get pregnant right away. If it wasn't for the bone loss issue I would definately get back on it after we have another child.,F,23,2  years,12/4/2009Email,Depo-provera
1057, 4, Birthcontrol,I haven't really had any side affects_ i have been on it about 2 or 3 weeks. I'm normally moody and tired_ i have lost weight though.,I possibly have endometrios_ it runs in my family_ my doctor said that it seems to be the best treatment because it could get rid of it. Birthcontrol pills don't work for me_ they make my period work and my cramps worse to the point that i can't even walk around at work.,F,17,3  weeks,12/1/2009,Depo-provera
1058, 1, Regulate menstrual cycle,Headaches_ neck and back pain_ achey joints_ mood swings_ 3 week long periods.,I took the depo shot to regulate my periods.  I was having a period every 2-3 weeks_ and was told this would stop that.  I have been having a period now for 3 weeks and have been having neck and back pain and headaches.  I also didn't realize the risk of osteoporosis after being on the shot.  After doing more research I will not be getting the next shot.  I wish I would have researched more before agreeing to get it in the first place.,F,32,2  months,12/1/2009Email,Depo-provera

Although it's an upside that i didn't get a period for the first two months when i did it lasted for nine days... unusual for me. I vomitted blood and spat up blood and still am doing it. I feel depressed and my bipolar is worse. I did research and found out that this is most likely the cause to all of my problems and found out some woman are suffering infertility after getting the shot. My doctor didn't tell me ne of this would happen. Wish i did more research.,M,20,3  months,11/29/2009,Depo-provera
1060, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,Increase in migraines_ weight gain (20 lbs)_ anxiety_ spotting_ acne_ skin became oily,I have been on it for 6 months. My next shot is supposed to be Dec 4_ but I will not be taking it. I'm going back to old birth control. The weight gain didn't seem to bad and the acne could be cleared up with extra work in taking care of my skin; those were my thoughts after the first 3 months. I loved not having a period and not worrying about chronic yeast infections from the pill. Depo is so not worth it in the end. Our bodies just aren't meant to have something completely screw with our cycle like Depo does. After 6 months without a period_ I began spotting out of no where. I have acne and have gotten 6 cysts in 1 month and have ingrown hairs all over my legs and have gained 20 lbs. I feel disgusting_ not to mention the horrible anxiety I have been experiencing. I am a very strong person who has been through a lot and now I am terrified of everything and worried from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. Also_ I have horrible vivid nightmares every night and migraines. Apparently my body is trying to tell me that something isn't right and it's obviously the Depo. I know it sounds like a wonderful idea_ but it is not worth throwing your body out of whack.,F,22,6  months,11/26/2009,Depo-provera
1061, 2, to avoid pregnancy,depression>>>suicidal ideation_ anxiety_ change in appetite_ mood swings_ trouble sleeping_ stomach pains,While it was VERY convenient to just have the shot and mind my own business_ it caused a lot of mood swings for me. I am already being medicated for anxiety and depression_ so I assume that I was predisposed to the mood changes_ but I noticed that my thoughts were extremely hopeless during the time when my cycle should have been going. My boyfriend noted the change in my behavior and told me to never get that shot_ again....so I listened :),F,24,90  days,11/24/2009,Depo-provera
1062, 1, Birth Control,hmm where do i start....mood swings_ no periods_ no sex drive_ nearly ended my marriage_ depression_ weight gain_ angry most of the time_ low self worth.....the list goes on,I started taking this jab in Apr 09. I went to get a smear test done after i had a baby and it was recommended to me. I should really have done reaserch but we usually listen to what doctors say because we expect that they know best. I've since had two more which totals 3 jabs in 2009. I was due for another end of October but after what i've been going through and the extra reaserch i've done i decided to stop taking it. Its been 3 months now and i'm yet to see my period. what scares me is hearing about the irregular bleeding after you stop it. Ive been home from work for months depressed. There was so much ( and still is) so much fighting and arguments in my marriage that at one point we talked about divorce. I just generally felt like crap and not myself. I thought this jab was perfect when i heard no periods and how well it works as a contraceptive but they don't tell you the side effects you have to do your own reaserch. I would NOT recommend Depo- provera to anyone. I will NEVER touch it again.,F,25,5  months,11/23/2009,Depo-provera
1063, 3, No pregnancy,Moodiness_ anxiety_ weight gain_ fatigue_ bruises at injection site,It is great for people who do not have regular schedules and can not remember to take pills but there are a lot of negative side effects so I do not recommend for extended periods of time(under 2 years). For the first six months I did not notice any change but lately I have been irritated and sleepy a lot. I have also gained about twenty pounds_ which isn't too bad because I've always been underweight. After eleven months of being on it I've noticed some spotting. The biggest problems for me are the fatigue and the anxiety_ I am busy with school_ work and a family and get regular sleep but it never seems to be enough because I am always feeling like I need a nap and always feel worried and anxious when there isn't anything wrong. I understand that this is different for everyone and hope you do too but I just hope that I can help another woman identify any side effects she may be experiencing and inform newcomers to the possible side effects.,F,25,11  months,11/22/2009Email,Depo-provera

SOME MONTHS. EVEN 2 MONTHS IN A ROW..? WHEN I DO HAVE ONE IT IS CLUMPY AND GROSS..NOT FLUID LIKE USUAL.

Basically_ not feeling like myself.,I cannot express enough how happy I am to have found this website. I was truly beginning to think something about me had suddenly gone wrong and that I was developing a mental disorder! Seriously! I have experienced many of the same side effects that most other women have on here_ especially the hot flashes_ dizziness_ weight gain_ fatigue and the psychotic episodes. I am normally a level headed person who is mature enough to handle most any situation. But since being on the shot_ I started in May 2008_ I have almost lost the ability to keep my cool! Especially when it comes to issues with my boyfriend of two years. It was recommended that I go on the shot because I was suseptible to migraines. The only thing the doctor told me was that I may gain weight as it increases appetite_ and I would not have a period...yeah! NOT! I am due for my next shot this week_ but I will not be getting it. I am going to go back on the regular 'ol pill. I am so upset with myself for not researching this drug sooner. I had no idea my physiological as well as psychological changes were due to taking this drug_ not to mention the possibility of sterility! I feel hopeful about getting off it and getting back to myself again. I will try to update.,F,27,1  years,11/18/2009,Depo-provera

After Yaz gave me extreme migraines_ they switched me to a lower estrogen pill which brought be back to two periods a month.  My doctor suggessted Depo and said it would cause my periods to STOP so I thought that sounded great and agreed.  She didn't inform me that it could also have the REVERSE affect.  I have been bleeding non-stop for over 6 months now and have thousands of dollars in medical bills from fainting and MRIs because I've been so dizzy and fatigued all the time.  The mood swings are harming my relationships and affecting my work and school work. Complete loss of sex drive_ COMPLETE!  A new OBGYN informed me that 30% of women experience reverse side effects...I THINK 30% is ENOUGH TO WARN SOMEONE ABOUT BEFORE TAKING IT! There is nothing you can do to help the side effects except wait it out. I've been waiting 3 months_ and no change. I am so unhappy with Depo and strongly encourage everyone to do research before taking it. DO NOT TAKE DEPO. It has ruined 6 months of my life and has messed up my body in so many ways. I was completely healthy before taking Depo. I would rather have 2 periods a month again than be bleeding everyday. The mood swings are unbearable. Slight acne has appeared_ too. I'd do anything to reverse these side effects. WE SHOULD GET DEPO BANNED!!!!!  All of this doesn't even begin to describe what it has done to me.,F,19,6  months,11/16/2009Email,Depo-provera

And so then she gave me the first dose around may 09 and ii took it and i was due in for my second shot around august 09 and i never did take the second dose thou because i noticed on and off weird periods_ spotting_ nausea_ heavy heavy cramping which i am still getting almost every day now and also no period_ and weight gain_ I just bought like two or three brand new pair of jeans and now i can't fit any of them because of my weight and also it's been 3 months since i had a period. because before taking the medication i had regular periods then after taking the shot i had very little periods or spotting and t,,F,23,3  months,11/16/2009Email,Depo-provera

I have developed horrible anxiety and hate to leave the house. And have become depressed. I have horrible stomach and back pains. I always feel nauseous_ like im going to throw up. Im always exhausted and all i do is sleep. The only side effects the doctor said i would have was weight gain. I only took it once and i feel for people who took it for years.

I feel like this shot has ruined my face. I'm so unhappy in life right now because of what it did. Other than that it is okay.

I talked to my doctor and she said the side effects from it vary_ but couldn't give me diffinitive answers.

Sore breasts is an understatement. Now almost 10 years later_ I still have no children. Talk about your sterility.,"At first it seemed like a great invention to not have the monthly curse. When you are 18_ ""sowing wild oats"" it seems like a God send..now after going thru all that I have to get pregnant_ Depo seems to have been a HUGE mistake.

It was GREAT!!!! NO MORE PERIODS! No pain_ mood swings_ living around a period.... Until I started to knowtice continuing weight gain. I even got a personal trainer. I gained even more (approx 15lbs.) Oh something else_ Did you know there's some kind of steriod in the shot?!Then I started with the achne... No matter what I've tried it only works for a little bit. The headaches.... I kept putting them down to stress at work_ home_ school. They're constant! The sex drive... GONE! The depression... well it's constant. About a year and a half ago I went off the shot because I got tired of going to get a shot in the butt every 3months (I'm terrified of needles)_ it took almost 9 months for my period to come back. And when it did_ in some ways it was WORSE than before. For someone who had always been regular (like a clock)_ everything was all over the place. Months in between_ the clots_ pain_ EVERYTHING! And the more it came the worse it got. Eventually I went back on it. But it's not the answer! I just wish my own Doc_ would listen and get to the bottom of my problems and find a way to fix it. Oh I did loose some of the weight when I went off the shot_ but since going on it again_ I've gained it all back. In some ways yes it did help_ but in the ways that matter most... NOT A CHANCE!!!!

In the two years that I have taken the shot_ the only consistancy from the treatment was the inconsistancy. My weight fluxuated_ my mood swings effected everyone one of my relationships_ and the bleeding became a gamble: Will I bleed today or not? Not to mention the severe abdominal cramps.

I have extreme fatigue_ I found out my foot is broken (took a physical) - probably from the loss of calcium. I have night sweats_ no sex drive_ severe depression_ hair loss above my ears and crown of head_ and my body odor is different and stronger.

PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.,If I could go back over my 40 yrs on this earth and change one thing only_ it would be to have never_ ever_ have started this evil drug. It has ruined my life - the 4 years taking it and the last 5 years since I stopped it. I have done enough research to know that it's this injection that has has caused my problems. I was the perfect picture of health_ apart from vertigo_ when my Gynaecologist decided that the vertigo was due to a hormone imbalance. As it turned out I had MS. This is now so much worse than it was all those years ago and I now have the effects of this drug to deal with too.,F,40,4  years,10/28/2009,Depo-provera
1088, 1, Birth control,Im 18_ just got my first shot in september. it is now the end of october and i have experienced all of the following: Extreme Mood swings_ Depression_ Increased apatite. I just recently started spotting and had continuous extremely painful cramping all day yesterday. My clear skin now had breakouts all the time.,If i would have known all that woud happen before i got the shot_ i woud never have gone through with it. it may be hassle free & easy_ but the things you go through for it_ isn't worth in the long run.,F,18,2  months,10/25/2009,Depo-provera
1089, 1, Only option for birth control,No sex drive_moodiness and very vile attitude_too many hot flashes and severe cramping.,If I had found this site before my first shot there is no way in hell I would have taken it.I got my first shot 8-20-09 and on 8-31-09 I started bleeding and 56 days later I am still bleeding_some days so heavy I use diapers to keep from bleeding all over the place.In two months times I have purchased 7 months worth of pads and tampons_I am afraid to leave the house out of fear of soiling my clothes.I started my first period when I was 12 and never had a cramp in my life_noe the cramps are so bad I just sit/lay in bed_hold my stomach and rock.My patience is short and everybody I know has started calling me mean_thank God I don't own a gun.The only reasons this works as birth control is because_#1.you are bleeding everyday_#2.your attitude is so stank_no man will come near you_#3.You have no desire to have sex and #4.If you have a man he will leave you beacuse no man will believe that his woman is having a 56 day period_I will definitely not be taking the second shot_I would rather have 20 kids than to go through this.The prayer that I pray everyday_all day is Lord please stop the bleeding.Thank you for such valuable information and I am so glad that I am not alone in this.,F,46,2  months,10/25/2009Email,Depo-provera

1091, 1, Birth Control,Excessive bleeding and clotting. Moodiness_ bloated_ cramping,Doctor gave me no information about this form of birth control. Only focused on the fact that it would stop my periods and it was convinent. A week after being injected have bled uncontrollably. Once night had to sleep on the toilet because I would soak through a pad literally every 10 minutes. I can only imagine how much weight I will gain since that's another side effect that was not mentioned to me. Worse part is there is nothing you can do about getting out of your body besides just waiting. DON'T USE THIS FORM OF BORTH CONTROL!,F,26,1  months,10/21/2009,Depo-provera

I have gained 20 lbs_ my  hair is thinning and falling out_ I get light headed at random times_ my stomach hurts_ I have leg pain_ joint pain. Plus I AM TIRED ALL THE TIME!

It is now october_ i still have not got a period or have stopped gaining weight.  I was always a small person up until using this drug.  Then moodiness was just terrible.

1099, 4, bc,weight gain,iv been using this in regards to bc for just about 3 years now. My mood has changed dramatically for the better. its easier to make a dr appt at the end of a 3 month window than it is to take a pill everyday-personally. I wouldnt rule out other forms of contraceptives however. I have gained a bit of weight these past few years. Not enough to  have to go out and buy a new wardrobe but enough to want to hit the gym. Its deffinatly not for everyone. And each person getting this shot has their own reason. Dont be afraid to ask your dr questions. And most importantly dont be afraid to stop getting the shot if you no longer think its right for you. One thing i have noticed about getting this is that i feel sometimes obligated to continue with it. Just keep asking yourself- is this still something im interested in?,F,19,3  days,10/11/2009,Depo-provera

I didn't feel like I needed to use anything given my age (42) and medical condition (PCOS)_ but we decided the depo shot was my best option since I was breastfeeding.  I was not informed of any complications and had previously taken birth control pills with no problems.  Everything was fine until about six weeks after the shot.  I had a period that lasted three weeks.  My breast milk supply was extremely poor where it had been very large.  I finally stopped the period and had two weeks of feeling okay_ then like an idiot_ I believed that I needed to take the second shot.  I have been having a period since Aug. 26.  It gets heavier everyday and I am an emotional wreck.  I cry at the drop of a hat_ I don't want to do anything.  I hurt from head to toe and my hair is coming out by the handful.

1103, 1, recommended by my doctor,hair loss_ moodiness_ loss of sex drive_ depression,It has been comforting to read about other people's experiences with Depo-provera. For me_ the side effects didn't truly start to kick in until the second shot. My first reaction was that there was something wrong with ME. I thought that my loss of sex drive was a sexual disfunction; I thought my moodiness and depression (set off by even the tiniest things) were signs of a character disorder; I reasoned that my hair loss was due to a perm I had gotten six months ago...I finally realized that these side effects weren't my fault--they were caused by these foreign hormones that I was putting into my body. Our society has become so nonchalant about birth control that girls are often blinded to the adverse side effects it causes. I recommend careful consideration of ANY birth control and its effects before starting it.,F,19,10  months,10/5/2009,Depo-provera

But by spring I had gained 15 pounds... all focused in my mid section_ despite exercising and watching what I ate. My joints hurt(thought I had arthritis or gout and all blood tests came back negative)_ my mild depression went to full blown bipolar. A few girls I know that have been on this before me_ strongly discouraged me from taking this and I ignored them... I wish I had listened to them cause Im paying for somthing stupid with horrible abuse on my body. My gyno said it could take up to a year for my periods to return.

Within the past 4 - 5 months I have started feeling hopeless about everything...and so sad. I feel like someone took a huge sponge and soaked up all the joy from my life. I don't enjoy anything anymore...not my kids sports_ not movies or tv_ eating out at restaurants_ being with friends or family_ nothing. I am empty and no one can reach me. And I am anxious...my heart races...I have irrational and obssessive thoughts constantly...worry_ worry_ worry is all I do. And sex?? What sex. I don't want it. I sleep on the very edge of the bed so my husband won't accidentally touch me because then he might want to have sex and I would rather eat glass. Also_ I can barely stay awake while driving. I literally have to baounce my head of the headrest to wake myself up sometimes. Be very careful if you choose this for BC.,F,41,9  months,9/29/2009,Depo-provera

1109, 3, Birth Control,Weight Gain_ No Sex Drive,I liked the shot itself_ not having to remember to take a pill everyday was hard for me_ I even like the fact you don't get your period_ that was great.  I did gain weight_ which I didn't know about_ my doctor stressed more about taking calcium for my bones than anything_ and when I explained I had no sex drive what so ever I was told to tell him to work harder at arousing me_ not_ this is a normal side affect_ so glad to know it's not me acting like some old lady! I had taken it for almost two years and recently stopped_ but I agree about the feeling pregnacy like symptoms_ sore breasts_ no period still after a few months_ it's very odd. I actually went to a weight loss doctor to help me loss the weight I put on because that's accurate about wanting to eat constantly. But_ I lost the weight_ and little by little I'm getting my sex drive back. Not the greatest but not the worst.,F,30,2  years,9/25/2009,Depo-provera

I received my first (and only) shot of Depo right after I had a miscarriage. I've never had problems with anxiety until now. I have been anxious 24/7_ I have no interest in sex_ or anything else for that matter. I've been suicidal and have even woken my mother up at various hours of the night from being in such pain from cramps I could do nothing other than weap. I have been spotting constantly since the shot and it seems like no matter how often I keep clean_ I still have a vaginal odor which I've never had before using this birth control.

My face has broken out terribly. My hairs thin. I have no energy at all. I ache. I feel alot older than I am from it. And I have been getting two periods a month. I have not had an injection in over a month and still feel side effects. Matter a fact I had a period two weeks ago and got another. I still feel very edgy.

1113, 1, endometriosis/form of birth contro,everything.,"I started taking depo as a form of birth control because it was easy_ and because i was diagnosised with endometriosis. I was in the worst pain of my life before I took depo. When I got my first shot I felt like a whole differnt person. The pain was gone_ no period_ it was great. But then after the next couple of shots I_ my parents and my fiance all started noticing a change. I had sever headaches_ joint pain_ a feeling of nervousness all the time_ a GREAT loss of sex drive and wanting to do anything AT ALL. I was plain out depressed. I felt like a robot. I stopped hanging out with family and friends_ I was uninterested in doing anything but being locked up in the house....and im only 20! I've been on this birth control now for 2 1/2 years_ I've never once had a period_ or spotting since I've gotten my second shot. But now even after being off of depo for 6 months and wanting to have a baby_ I can't because I STILL haven't gotten a period.

It really sucks and it seems like since I started the shot everything tastes completely different. So it's 6 years since I've stopped taking the shot_ and I am still constantly starving_ all the time_ and when I eat nothing seems to satisfy my taste buds. I have gained 35 lbs. and it is very hard to control the hunger and lose the weight. PLEASE IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS BIRTH CONTROL_ RETHINK YOUR OTHER OPTIONS.,M,23,1  years,9/16/2009,Depo-provera

My sex drive is practically non-existant_ and although it says that your periods may stop all together_ it is like mine has never stopped. Like someone else said_ a big reason why this works for birth control is because you either don't want it_ can't have it (because of spotting)_ or are far too moody for your boyfriend/husband to want to have anything to do with you.,F,21,9  weeks,9/14/2009,Depo-provera
1119, 3, Pregnancy prevention,Mood swings_ cramps_ loss of sex drive_ fatigue,I've been on the shot for 2 years now. I did not gain weight but it was impossible to lose any weight! I love not having a period and not worrying about getting pregnant! But that's about it. The day I get my shot I end up with a migraine and nasty nausea. The day after I'm still nauseated and have cramps. My left breast is permenantly tender to touch and I'm constantly tired. I have NO sex drive what so ever! I'm actually scared my husband will go elsewhere because I really despise sex! The shot is soooo easy and so effective that I keep getting it (maybe because my mom in law is essentially my doctor and will NOT let me miss one....she brings it home from work!) it's alsomst like choosing the lesser of 2 evils! I got pregnant with both of my kids while on the pill because it was so hard to remember it and the nuva ring kept coming out during sex and was a pain to remove. I won't get the implant because it perminantly irritates the lining of your uteras and as a nurse_ I'm really not comfortable with that thought! The shot is also depleating my calcium which is taking it's toll on my teeth! I really think that with the long term effects_ I'll regret my decission to use the shot for birth control! But for now it works....like I said....lesser of 2 evils!,F,25,2  years,9/12/2009,Depo-provera

If you do your research in the begining it does warn you about all the side effects that could happen but I have only experienced one. (The hunger) But even that is mind over matter. You get a shot once every 3 months and it works incredibly! I would recommend it to anyone!!!!,F,25, ,9/11/2009,Depo-provera

1122, 1, birth control,anxiety_ extreme irritability_ bleeding_ headaches_ fatigue_ low sex drive_ acne,"My doctor suggested I get this shot due to the fact that I had the Novasure (endometrial ablation) procedure and it would be very dangerous for me to get pregnant.  The nurse in the office told me the main side effects they see in their practice are weight gain and bleeding.  I have not gained weight_ but I have been spotting and bleeding since one week after receiving the shot (August 19).  I was informed at the office that bleeding ""should not be a problem"" for me_ since I had the Novasure.  What a joke!  The reason I had the Novasure to begin with was because my periods were lasting for 30 days at a time!  Now it seems like I'm back where I started from.  I am also EXTREMELY irritable_ which is not like me at all.  My husband and kids are paying the price in this aspect_ and I hate that!  I told my husband the reason this shot works so well for birth control is because 1)you are so irritable_ no one would want you_ 2)the acne is so ugly_ no one would want you_ 3)you don't feel like having sex due to the constant bleeding_ and 4)YOU don't want anyone because you have no sex drive AT ALL!

I still haven't seen my period yet and after reading about other's experiences_ I don't expect my cycle to return to normal anytime soon. My husband and I want to try to have a baby but I'm terrified it'll take a year or more. I've been having bad headaches since going off the shot. While on the shot I wouldn't have a bowel movement for a week or more and then when I did have one_ it would be diarrhea. It was awful. It was like this every week for 2 years.

I am so bloated I can no longer fit into most of my clothes.  My breasts are huge and feel like they weigh 3 pounds each - my bra size was a small ""C"" prior to this injection; but now I think I must be a ""D"" or bigger as I'm busting out of my bras.  I am constantly hungry and have gained 6 pounds over the past 9 weeks. Prior to this medication I was fun_ happy_ and easy going.  Now however I am easily irritated and will go off for no apparent reason.  I will NOT be taking an additional injection and i am emailing all of my friends to avoid this medication.

I am slowly losing the weight I put on (so far lost 15 lbs in 3 months). Sex was extremely painful to the point I could not have any sex at all. My GP did not discuss the side effects and when I told her about not liking the shot she told me everyone else is delighted with it and couldn't understand how I could not like it! WTF?! You have to do your own research before getting this! I practically forced her to switch me to a different BC and now I'm on progesterone-only pills (POPs) and feel a million times better.

There is not even a day where I am not bleeding! I can't wait 'til this is completely out of my system but from the looks of the other posting it could be more than just awhile!

A friend of mine had great results with it and never had a period at all..one of the few lucky ones..so I thought I would try it. BIG MISTAKE!

I took the shot in May and everything was fine until the end of June.  At that time I started spotting continuously (every day all day) and then I had my cycle which I thought would fix this issue but it went on for 2 1/2 weeks and then the continuous spotting returned.  I am now into my eigth week of my long cycle with no sign of it stopping. My doctor has told me this is a reaction that some women experience and I have to wait it out until the drug is out of my system. The information I have found suggests that this could continue for 6 to 8 months.  So I would highly recommend another form of birth control first before using this method.

I have had surgery twice and been on birth control pills. After my second surgery in June of '09 I was put on this shot. At first it worked great except for a few break through bleeding every now and then. I would say after my second injection I began to loose weight. I weighed 112 lbs. gained 3 to be 115 lbs. then lost 22 lbs. to now be 92 lbs. I am 4' 11 so this is not a healthy weight for me. I also began to have periods exactly a month before I got the next injection_ and they would last 7_ 14_ and one time it lasted 17 days! I have always had a lot of hair but now it just falls out in clumps I cant even run my fingers through my hair anymore because I am scared it will just pull more out. After my third shot my friends and family began to notice that I was not my bubbly outgoing self anymore_ I was just so tired and never felt good. My doctor says that this would have shown up after my first injection_ but that is not the case. She also said if you are prone to depression the shot will pull it out_ but im telling you I have never felt depressed or as messed up as I do now. I would get so upset over every little thing and could switch from being happy to pissed off in about 2 seconds. I was just not myself anymore and am tired of it.

I stay very moody and emotional almost like I am bipolar and I have never had any problems like that before this shot.  I have been having headaches that last all day long and because I stay so quizzy all the time I never wanna eat.

1144, 5, birth control,slight spotting fatigue for a week after injection,Depo isnt evil like the reviews make it seem. It costs me $17 (generic brand) every 3 months which cant be beat_ and you dont have to remember to take pills everyday. It did NOT decrease my sex drive_ did NOT make my acne worse_ did NOT make me moodier_ and DID NOT MAKE ME GAIN A SINGLE POUND. I think it affects different people differently but so far so good for me. (FYI Ive been on other birth controls and had VERY negative side effects) I think it's time someone write a success story for it. Also_ if youre considering depo_ realize that the people who typically write these reviews only write them because they are angry. Its less likely that someone who is happy with the drug take the time to write a review. Everyones body reacts differently to different prescriptions_ but because Ive had so much success with depo_ I would 100% recommend it.,F,22,4  months,8/11/2009,Depo-provera

I've had mild spotting here and there and I've noticed slight hair loss_ but it's okay because I have really thick hair so I can spare some of it =],I've been on Depo for about 4 months now. I was skeptical when I first started the shots after reading all these horrible reviews on it_ but I went for it anyways. So far I've only had minor break through bleeding_ and I've noticed some hair loss but it's not enough to make me worry. I love this birth control because I have not gained ANY weight so far. Although I do have an increased appetite. But that's something you have to learn to live with. (As my mom always say_ you have to learn to embrace hunger sometimes) I was on about 7 other kinds of birth control pills before my doctor prescribed me the shot_ and I'm completely happy with this one. The other pills made me moody to the point where I was constantly snapping at my family and boyfriend_ but I've experienced none of that while on Depo.

I regret getting the Depo.  With all of the side-effects people are enduring_ it should be taken off the market.  I haven't had a period yet and it's been 7 months since I got the injection.

I am constantly hungry to the point of it being painful_ and I amrequiring meals 2 or 3 times larger than normal. I am suffering a total lack of motivation to do anything_ and a frustrating non-existent sex drive (previously it was extremely high). Awful shot_ don't go near it!,F,21, ,7/15/2009,Depo-provera

I finally decided to get off of the injection because I gained 40 pounds in one year without changing any of my eating habits. I hated the injection at first because I still got my period for about 4 months after my first injection. The bleeding would last for three weeks. I did consult a doctor who said that my uterus was just getting rid of the build up on the wall of the uterus. Then my period completely went away. I loved it. Plus I got less acne and felt one hundred percent. I did however stop getting the injections because of my upcoming wedding and wanting to lose the weight I gained.,F,20,2  years,7/14/2009Email,Depo-provera

I had really bad mood swings.. now after taking it over a year my husband just hates the shot.. he wants me off of it and to never go on it ever again ..

He wasn't going to even allow me to get it through his services.. so I had to tell him I would be off of it after this... besides I don't want to be on it anymore.. and if he thinks it's that bad.. I know it can't be good for my body .. too many side effects .. I mean I like being covered for 3 months.. and not have to worry about a pill.. but I guess I'll just go on a pill and see if they can regulate some hormones..

Doctor had recommended this due to my recent diagnosis of high blood pressure.,On Pfizer's own site (about 4 months ago) they had a warning about depo provera stating that no one should take this BC for more than 2 years due to the severe osteoporosis that is coming to light for users who used it more than 2 years.  This concerned me since my doctor never gave me any printed information about side effects (that's why I was on the official site-- to find out if my side effects were caused by the medication).  That part of the site is no longer accessible_ so I wonder if Pfizer is circling its wagons_ so to speak (maybe litagation is starting to happen??).

My doc recommended trying depo for a year to try and stop my periods....so far it has not worked.  I am trying to hang in there for a full year to see if my periods will eventually stop otherwise I guess I'll be bleeding until i hit menopause.,Hearing so many terrible stories about depo is scary but I'm hoping that things will eventually settle down since there do seem to be some people that do well on it.

I have always been an athlete so the weight gain did not effect me very much except an increased appetite. I only took one shot and decided not to do it again. A few weeks after getting the shot I had vaginal dryness and there were sharp pains any time I had sex. After discontinuing the treatment I have such extreme mood swings_ and even fits of rage. While on Depo I only had one period and had such sharp pains in my lower abdomin. I went the restroom to have my uterine wall fall out! My boyfriend took me to the ER right away and they explained it was nothing serious_ just my body getting used to the drug since I had had no period for 2 months.

I thought that the vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse was just from childbirth but now I am finding out that depo seems to cause it. I bled for the first 6 months after giving birth NONSTOP! And now it has gone away but two days ago I started experiencing this terrible muscle soreness in my arms and legs and it won't go away. It feels as if I ran a marathon but I have not done any exercise out of the ordinary. Does anyone know if this is a side effect of depo?

1206, 4, Birth Control,Not sure that any of my symptoms are from depo or not. I have been on it twice. The first time I had no symptoms at all. Now I do have some of the listed side effects but am not sure if they are related or not since I didn't have any when on it before.,I have collectively been on depo for about 5 years. I tried other forms of birth control first but found them to be innefective. I started on the pill and became pregnant. After the birth of my son I had an IUD_ about a year after I had the IUD placed I became pregnant again. This was very scary as they had to remove the IUD once I became pregnant which has a whole slew of side effects in itself and can cause miscarriage.  So after the birth of my second child I opted to go on depo. I didn't gain any weight_ I had no side effects at all. I did have irregular_ and sometimes seemingly non stop periods for the first 3 months. By the time I received my second shot my periods had become less frequent and much lighter_ only getting it about 4 times a year_ and it was so light it was difficult to even use tampons. My husband and I decided we wanted another child (#3) so I stopped taking the shot. It took over  year for me to get pregnant after I stopped the shot_ but we also were not timing it_ or taking temperatures_ or anything like that. We decided we'd stop the birth control and then it would happen when it happened. So that may have contributed to why it took so long to get pregnant. I was completely fine after stopping the shot and had no adverse effects_ headaches_ depression_ mood swings. None of that. My third child is now 9 months old. At my 6 week appointment after her birth I opted to go back on the shot. I had a very pleasing experience with it previously. Since about 3,F,35,5  years,5/29/2009Email,Depo-provera
1207, 1, recomended for Essure procedure,Spotting constantly_ bad mood swings_ depression_ no sex drive.,I got the shot because it was recomended to do for the Essure procedure I had done. I had heard the horror stories but against my better judgement I did it in hopes it would make my procedure easier. I have been on it a month and its been bad. I get depressed_ very short with people including the ones I love. constant crampning_ spotting. My moods are horrible I am usually pretty happy go lucky but here lately nothing makes me happy- no sex drive_ bad mood swings_ depression. I keep headaches all the time_ cramping constantly. I have not had a period per say but I spot all the time. I only had to do this once & I will never do it again. I dont feel like the same person.,F,36,1  months,5/29/2009Email,Depo-provera
1208, 1, Birth Control,Extreme loss of libido_ depression_ fatigue_ loss of periods,Originally took this a few years ago and was very happy with it at the time. Came off it due to stories of osteoporosis_ tried the implant which just made me bleed constantly. Have gone back on Depo but am in serious relationship now which I wasn't when first taking it. Have found that it has reduced my libido to nothing. Have no interest in sex or anything relating to it. Have found studies to suggest links to cancer and that this drug is used to treat sex offenders to reduce their libido. I recommend really reading up about Depo and not just taking what your Doc says as gospel. I'm coming off the injection and will be trying to find a pill that suits me now.,F,28,5  years,5/27/2009Email,Depo-provera

1211, 4, Birth Control,,I actually like taking the depo shot. I am a bit moody_ and irritable_ but I've only gained 2 pounds. My migraines decreased rapidly_ and my acne went away. It's so much easier takiing the shot instead of the pill. My mom and I are the only women in my family that are able to take depo without becoming extremely sick. I get tired alot_ but that might just be part of my depression. My apetite stayed the same_ and I haven't had my period in almost 8 months_ which I absolutely love. I don't even get symptoms of having my period anymore.,F,15,9  months,5/20/2009Email,Depo-provera
1212, 3, Pregancy Prevention,Tired_ weight gain_ sore boobs_ lack of sex drive.,I can't take the pill - it makes me crazy. :) So I figured I'd try the shot; I've had 2 so far. I seem pretty tired all the time but that's not stopping me and could also be compounded by my career and stress. I've also gained weight which is worriesome since I'm an athlete and work out all the time and thought I could prevent the weight gain. It came in the 3rd month of the 1st shot_ almost over night_ but I'm determined to manage that with my diet and exercise. I haven't had the mood swings or depression others speak of and that was my problem with the pill. I do notice a lack of libido (not an absolute dead libido)_ which sucks_ obviously_ but my boyfriend is aware and we just try to do different things to make me excited. My boobs do get sore but typically only right after the shot and only for about a week or so_ it tends to go away after a while. So I'd say even with the fatigue_ weight gain_ slight lack of sex drive and soreness of boobs sometimes - the shot is still better than the pill and condoms (and I tried those patches which were nasty) and better than getting pregnant. Hopefully after your body gets used to the hormone_ these symptoms will subside. I'm going to give it the full 9 months (3 shots) before I make a decision about it.,F,29,4  months,5/20/2009,Depo-provera

I BLED FOR FOUR MONTHS STRAIGHT which drained the iron in my blood and made me very anemic. i took this when i was 17 and only got the shot ONCE.

At my follow up appt_ my doctor suggested depo provera as a way to ease the PMDD symptoms.  She told me the side effects could be weight gain and spotting.  Within a few days of the shot_ I felt like I was going through PMDD!!  Instead of reducing the symptoms_ it GAVE me the symptoms.  DO NOT TAKE THIS WITHOUT SERIOUSLY RESEARCHING THE SIDE EFFECTS.

I started experiencing heart palpitations_ headaches_ dizziness and fatigue about six months after the first shot.  At first I didn't connect the two.  After numerous doctor visits and tests they were not able to find any ""medical"" reason for my symptoms.  I now fully believe that depo is the root cause to all of my problems.  Needless to say_ I will not be getting my next shot in July.  I now just have to wait it out and hope that once this poison leaves my body my symptoms will go away completely or at least get to the point where I don't have constant headaches everyday.

1219, 5, Birth control; heavy periods,no period_ lack of sex drive,I absolutely loved it! I took Depo for 5 years (starting when I was 21) and had no period the entire time. My fiance turned husband also loved the fact that we didn't have to use any other form of birth control. We decided that we wanted to have children when I was 26 and I stopped the shot; we started trying 12 months after my last shot and I was pregnant 2 months later. After my pregnancy was over and my periods returned_ they were lighter and shorter than any I'd had before the depo (from 8 days of VERY HEAVY bleeding to 4-5 days_ with only 2 days of heavy bleeding) and I could predict my periods down to the hour. This continued after my second pregnancy_ as well. While I can't say for sure that it was the depo_ I certainly can't complain.,F,31,5  years,5/11/2009,Depo-provera

If you have even the slightest bit of history of depression either with you or running in your family - DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!

I also don't want him to kiss me or touch me_ which is devastating because we've been waiting so long to be together sexually and now I don't have the desire! what?! why didn't the dr tell me this stuff?!

I started exercising everyday and dieting_ but I still gained weight. Not having my period for a year was great_ but now that I am off of it_ I've had my period for a straight 3 months. Sometimes I'll go 2 or 3 days between periods_ but for the most part it is a continuous thing. My hormones are so messed up from going off of it_ too.

I have had extrremly bad headaches to the point to where all I could do is just sit in my room with the tv and all the lights off cause the littlest noise or light will bother me. I am currently on medicine for my headaches because they are so bad. Before I started the shot I was so skinny I weighed about 95 pounds and now I am 125! I got on the shot right before I graduated (07) so I kinda thought a little big of the the weight gain came from what people call the freshman 15. I havent had a period at all!!! I have no sex drive at all and I also have vaginal dryness.. Thats kinda causing a problem for me and my boyfriend of 3 years.. He really see the difference in our sex now that I am on the shot I feel bad sometimes because I dont want him to think that I am not intersted in him any more. I have been having abdominal pain for about a year now and I even went to the dr's for it and asked if it could be caused by the shot and they told me no! I love being on the shot because I dont have to worry about getting pregnant and I dont have to worry about periods but the headaches is the worse and the abdominal pain is starting to be really bothersome so I wont be taking my next shot!,F,19,2  years,5/6/2009Email,Depo-provera

Before the shot I had a very_ very high libido! This was the biggest change for me_ the second biggest being the weight gain_ 10+ pounds in two years_ I am 5'7 and very slim and used to have an extremely high metabolism.,I stopped taking the shot over a year ago. In the last month or so I have dropped over 8 pounds out of nowhere. I have still not had a period. I'm not trying to get pregnant_ but I would like to regulate my body and be normal again_ as blood tests revealed that my progesterone levels were menopausal (I'm 20 and going through menopause!) so my doctor put me on Prometrium and I'm on my third month of taking it_ still no period.

I went in to the doctor telling her that I would get a little paranoid the week before my period (case of PMS) and she told me that this would ""level my mood"".  Yeah_ if an UNDERGROUND level is what she meant.  This is the worst thing I've ever done to my body.  For the past year and a half I spent changing my diet (became vegan) and involving myself into yoga and finding a deep connection with myself.  I had finally started to find the me-shaped hole inside of me (growing up was tough) and finally felt confident enough to be with a man--and_ if I didn't want pregnancy_ that involved a birth control method.  All the work I did to better myself (losing 100lbs_ feeling happy_ laughing_ making friends) all went down the tube as soon as I got shot in the butt.  I still have about a month and a half until I am due for another shot--which I will NEVER get...but I've read the detox time on that can take up to a year.  My plan is to drinks lots of water_ teas_ eat fruit and cleanse my system and come back to who I was always meant to be.  This depressed_ uncreative being that I am now is terrible.

I'm hoping the side effects will lessen over the next two months as they did before_ but I am having even more vaginal secretions during arousal_ which the boy is not complaining about at all. [he thinks its a compliment to him haha],I was a little iffy about depo immediately after the first shot. I have a history of bipolar_ and my manic and depression symptoms increased greatly. My first period lasted about 2 weeks of light spotting_ then went away. I was told by my mother who is a nurse that this would lessen and she was right.By the end of my third month_ I realized that as with any drug or birth control_ you will have initial symptoms until your body gets used to it. With pills_ i had morning sickness much worse than I experienced with Depo. I love it for its convenience. I initially had vaginal dryness_ but after a while it was like a faucet down there [sorry to be graphic] which can get annoying at times_ but the man i'm seeing thinks its great...he also doesnt know its because of depo though haha. Overall_ minus the mood swings_ i love it. It's great to have natural spontaneous sex without the risk of getting pregnant or the stress of remembering to take my pill and forgetting and freaking out for a week.

I have severe mood swings_ irritability_ and depression when I am due for a shot_ this has been noticably worse each time I am due for a shot(especially in the last year).  I have not had a period in 10 years_ which I haven't minded.  Although lately I feel like it is just not natural or normal not to have a period.  It has been very effective in preventing any unwanted pregnancy.  I am also concerned about having been on it for such an extended period of time although my doctor is not concerned about this.,F,31,10  years,4/8/2009Email,Depo-provera
1248, 5, Birth control,Some spotting during the first few months.  I had ONE spot on my face where I would get an acne cyst about 2 weeks after the shot_ which would eventually go away.  Decreased sex drive_ but not sure if that was due to the shot or my loser BF!,Love it!  After several months_ stopped having periods.  Shot is quick and easy and you don't have to worry about forgetting to take pills.  I have taken pills before and they make me spot continuously.  Depo caused some very minor spotting_ which went away after a couple of cycles.  I did not gain any weight.,F,32,2  years,4/7/2009,Depo-provera
1249, 1, birth control/no more babies,nausea for about 2 weeks_ weird pains in stomach_ chest pain_ leg pain_ depression_ fatigue_ insomnia_ forever bleeding_ weight loss about 8 pounds,I started depo on february 2_ 2009 and I was on my period.  It stopped for about a week and then the spotting started.  One night I had a constant left pain in my side and I was extremely nauseated.  That went away.  The bleeding continued and the 2 weeks later the constant nausea began.  I lost about 8 pounds I was 138 now I'm a solid 130.  The nausea has stopped and the bleeding has not. My chest pain and leg pain concerned the docs so they told me to go to the emergency room and I did.  They did cat scan_ chest x ray_ ekg and all_ they found nothing.  I feel overall just bad.  For some women its wonderful_ but for me I wont be going for my next shot.,F,30,2  months,4/7/2009,Depo-provera
1250, 1, pre-essure procedure,I've had 2 shots. I had 3 weeks of horrible spotting and shortly after the first shot_ severe joint pain. I couldn't sleep at nite_ kept waking up due to the pain in my shoulder. Went to physical therapy_ and 2 weeks later_ the other shoulder began waking me up at night. Now my hip has begun. Also_ lack of sex drive and dryness. Birth control works well when it makes you uninterested in having sex with your husband. I hate depo.,My doctor told me she was giving me the shot to thin my uterus prior to the Essure procedure. She gave me nothing to read_ no choice. No information on any possible side effects.  I had been on the pill for 10 years. The procedure didn't work_ she couldn't get the coils in my tubes. So_ my husband had a vasectomy_ and I had to take another shot to last until he was clear. At the time_ I didn't realize joint pain was a side effect. Had I known_ I would have demanded that I stay on the pill. I thought I had twisted my shoulder somehow. I hadn't. I am very angry_ and I feel like I've been ambushed by my doctor and the FDA and the company that makes this poison. My joints had better heal when this wears off. There had just better not be any permanent damage.,F,31,6  months,4/7/2009,Depo-provera

1252, 1, birth control,excessive bleeding_ PAIN during sex_ loss of sex drive or libido_ skin sensitivity_ depression.,"I've been on it for alittle more than four months now and the whole time I have experienced bleeding and spotting. There has not been one day that I have gone without bleeding.  It never gets to heavy but is constantly there. I have had depression for about 4 or 5 years now and this shot did not help whatsoever with it.  However_ the most aggrivating side effect so far is definitly the EXTREME pain I feel after about ten minutes of less of sex. There are even sometimes that I can't even have sex because the moment my boyfriends penis is inside of me it feels like my muscles cramp up and I get almost a raw sensation.  I used to be a freak in bed and now that my libido has decreased INTENSElY_ I don't have urges like I used to. This has been detrimental to my relationship sexually with my boyfriend. But above all_ I am just plain out PISSED that I went to my doctor_ described the pains I was getting_ and told me it had nothing to do with the shot. I had a perfectly fine time having sex before this.  I guess I should have just researched more about this ""poison"" of a shot before I went ahead and took it.    I just hope someone reads this in their researching and learns from it at least.   Who knows_ some girls do fine with the shot_  but from what I've been through and what I've read in other sites an blogs- there are alot of women out there who are just as PISSED as me.",F,19,4  months,4/5/2009Email,Depo-provera

1256, 3, Pregnancy Prevention,numerous fainting spells_ heart palpitations_ loss of libido_ memory loss,I began taking Depo when I was 16 (in 1996) and took it faithfully for 9 years. During my teen years_ I had many fainting spells and heart racing. We never related it to Depo at the time_ just teenage hormones. I didn't have a period for years! I trusted the doctors that this wouldn't be problematic in the future and it was pretty nice not to have to deal with that.I got off it to get pregnant which happened within 6 months. No complications there. I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old and didn't have any problems. I breastfed both for the first year of their lives and no problems there either. I now have a terrible memory_ which started in my early 20's. I'm not sure if it's directly related to the Depo_ or other events_ but it's there nonetheless. I haven't had any bone density tests_ which I should obviously do since I was on it for nine years_ so I can't comment on those effects.Overall_ I don't expect any drugs to be free of side-effects. I do wish that the doctors wouldn't be so quick to give a young kid a drug that's fairly new to the market.

1264, 1, Unbearable periods,I can completely relate to the stories of those taking the Depo shot for more than 1 year_ 40lbs in weight gain_ excessive peeing_ sever depression and anxiety_ complete lack of sex drive_ the works.  I mean just about everything the other readers have noted.  What I want to share with everyone is the fact that over the 8 years I was on Depo_ I moved several times and of course changed OBGYN¬ís.  Never once did any of the doctors mention that you SHOULD NOT be on Depo for more than 2 years.  I finally got tired of the hour wait for the shot at the OBGYN and turned to my regular doctor_ whom upon hearing how long I had been on it denied me from getting the shot anymore.After about 5 months of being off the shot_ I dropped a little over 20 lbs out of nowhere. It's been 19 months since my last shot and I still have not had a period.  Personally I am fine with not having a period as I don¬ít plan to have children_ but it would be nice to know if/ when I am going to get one.,You SHOULD NOT be on Depo for more than 2 years.,F,35,8  years,3/23/2009,Depo-provera
1265, 1, Birth Control,Depression_ Anxiety_ Loss of appetite_ significant weight loss_,I am 29 and was given this shot about a month ago and while I won't say my life is ruined_ I am in a terrible place. I've been depressed to a degree of not being able to function on a daily basis_ I have non stop anxiety and I can't bring myself to eat much - certainly not enough to sustain my health.  I was told by my doctor at the time (a doctor that I will never see again_ by the way) that there were no side effects.  My life has been so extremely difficult for the past 3 weeks that my new doctor is recommending that I go on an anti depressant just to get through the next few months.  If you are a woman who can't have estrogen for whatever reason (as I am) please seek out a doctor who can offer you non hormone birth control.  If anyone out there is experiencing any of what I've been experiencing they can attest: Depo Provera had literally taken over my life for the last few weeks and quite possibly the next few months.

Weight gain never became a problem_ my doctor warned me not to be on it for over 4 years I think due to some bone loss if you didn't take vitamins or calcium supplements. I did have a bone scan and I was losing density in my hips_ so that is the reason I got off of it. Very conveinete in a sense of not having to remember a pill everyday and only having to go to the doctor every 3 months. Overall it is really good alternative for a few years but I was on it for 7 years and now I am trying the Ortho Tri Cyclen.,F,23,7  years,2/24/2009,Depo-provera
1291, 1, Birth control,Spotting sometimes several times each month. Anxiety_ paranoia_ depression_ and anger that seemed to come each month during PMS time. Would usually last about 2 weeks.

1292, 1, birth control,At the time_ I suffered blood spotting and weight gain. I was on it continuously for 3 years. It was only after I got off it that - in hindsight- I had many more symptoms. These include mood swings_ irregular periods and dryness_ among others relating to early menopause.,I have only now just been diagnosed with early menopause. The symptoms - in hindsight - started with the use of depo-provera_ although I hadn't realised at the time. Over the last 7 years_ the symptoms became progressively worse_ until now where I need to take HRT due to lack of oestrogen. I doubt I would have had these symptoms if I hadn't taken depo-provera. Oh & forgetfulness is a symptom of early menopause as well. I had a fantastic memory and now due to short term memory loss_ I don't. So all symptoms of early menopause can be found elsewhere - and that is what depo-provera has given me.,F,36,3  years,2/23/2009,Depo-provera

My boyfriend has even noticed I've been different! AND my spotting didn't stop after the 3 months! It's been 4 almost 5 months and I am still spotting...its really gross! I am going off this shot! It's horrible!!!!!!!!!! I get annoyed so easily or I'm super emotional and I cry over anything...I feel like an emotional rollercoaster...happy for a min angry the next then I'm crying!

Before she gave me a prescriptions_ she did a pregnancy test to make sure it was safe for me to take the medication.  I went for a followup and she asked if I was on any kind of birth control.  I told her no because I've had problems with other kinds of birth control before.  She quickly goes on to tell me how great depo prevara is and that I should be on it_ side effects are minimal_ its the best out there for me.  It was so sudden_ I didn't really have time to think to really ask any important questions.  Any questions I did ask_ my concerns were downplayed and all I heard was how great this would be for me.  So I went ahead with the shot.  Now I'm having these side effects_ the headache is extremely intense.  I've only been on it for about a month.

I always had the matabolism of a humming bird until I took this shot and when I talked to my doctor he said the shot would not cause weight gain. I guess he thought I had suddenly become a gluttonous pig that ate non-stop_ but no_ he knew it was the Depo_ I wasn't sitting there stuffing my face while in his office. He must have been getting a kick back from the drug company to tell someone with that kind of sudden weight gain to keep taking what was causing it. Doctors take an oath to do no harm but that was obviously a joke to him. We all know too much weight is unhealthy. I'm not stupid!! I changed doctors!! This shot completely ruined my body forever!!!!

I asked my OBGYN if these symptoms could be related to the shot and she always told me absolutely not. So I kept getting the shot while my nightmare of panic_ anxiety_ palpitations_ depression and hypoglycemia was getting worse and worse. I was afraid of sitting home alone but also afraid of going anywhere by myself. Even walking into the grocery store would give me palpitations. I¬íve always had a very busy life and could not understand why all of a sudden I was not able to do anything anymore. Then about a month ago I decided to do some researches online.

It's awful and nearly destroyed my sex life with the guy I am seeing. I'm 20_ I don't want to use lube! Sex was painful_ almost with a stinging. Strange discharge and itching and I have been tested twice_ with clean results_ so it is depo's doing. I love the freedom of not worrying_ but if I start gaining weight there is no way I will take my second shot. Also one thing I wasn't expecting_ because I had been on an estrogen based birth control pill before_ once I got the shot_ my breasts have actually gotten SMALLER...which at an A already is pretty bad.

1328, 1, heavy and long periods,Literally within 1 week of getting this horrible shot I started breaking out like a 13 year old_ I became severely depressed and hated everyone and everything. I could not stop crying ( I have a history of depression and my doc should have never put me on this shot)_ I felt like there was no hope with anything in my life and I just didn't care. I got the shot on Oct 20_ 2008 instead of having the endometrial ablation_ I figured why have surgery if the shot could stop my periods?  Well_ that was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life....I decided to have the ablation right away knowing I would not be getting the shot anymore. I had the ablation done Dec 1_ 2008_ my 90 days from the depo shot was up about 4 days ago and I have not stopped bleeding since I had the ablation!!!!  Not sure if this bleeding is from the lingering side effects of the depo shot or the ablation.  The ablation is supposed to slow your periods down or even stop them.

I did gain some weight_ but I was never a thin person to begin with. I certainly wasn't exercising and was eating constantly...which a sure-fire way to gain weight regardless of your metabolism or your body type. I lost over 50 pounds by changing my attitude about what real hunger actually is versus eating out of boredom or emotional issues. (I recommend hospital-sponsored weight loss programs for serious weight issues.) I just think you have to do your research before deciding on what birth control is right for you. And if you go on Depo_ be vigilant about what you eat and how much you exercise...especially if you are not an active person in the first place. Just because you are thin now doesn't mean that your body will always stay that way...drugs or no drugs.

1332, 4, Prevent pregnancy.,Weight gain though not bad random spotting and bleeding.,I absolutely love taking the shot_ alot of women are having so many side effects_ and so few arn't. I guess I'm one of the lucky few. I have been taking the shot since i was a Freshman in highschool (8/06) and i have not had any bad problems. The only problem that i had was random spotting and bleeding for the first 9 months now i have absolutely none at all. Only recently since my last shot (11/08) have i had any weight gain_ i gained 5 pds._ but my weight varies all the time so i'm not 100% possitive about DEPO being the problem. I am extremely overemotional but i have been that way since i was little i don't think the DEPO is to blame. I am thinking that some of the women on here are trying to find an easy excuse for their problems and DEPO seems like the easiest. That's only my opinion though. I'm sorry for everyone that have had so many problems but I LOVE IT! It just isn't right for everyone.,F,17,3  years,1/17/2009Email,Depo-provera

1341, 1, birth control,No noticable ones the first two years_ except I never had a period after starting the Depo the day I left the hospital after my last son was born.  After this I gradually put on 20lbs which I couldn't lose no matter how much I dieted or excersized.  Then the depression kicked in every morning.  I couldn't figure out what was wrong.  I had a great life_ but was depressed every morning.  My hands fell asleep at night and this woke me up.  Lots of insomnia.  Acne_ which I hadn't had since I was 13yrr old.  Hot flashes and sweating.,I have been off depo since Oct. of 08'.  I no longer have insomnia_ am dropping the weight with diet and feel none of the heavt depression.  I still haven't had a period_ but I understand it may take up to two years to come back.  My doctors only informed me of bone density issues and never mentioned these other side effects.  Please investigate before taking.  Not having a period is cool for 5 years_ but the side effects weren't worth it.  So glad to be over them.,F,44,5  years,1/9/2009,Depo-provera
1342, 1, Essure procedure,Period started late by one week -- that was 45 days ago. Still bleeding! Not heavy_ but still not fun!,I was given this shot in order to have the Essure procedure. No pros or cons discussed with me. I did my own research. I was hesitant but figured it was one time deal. My hesitancy was more because of my age - 41 - and I didn't want to jack with my hormones - more afraid of an emotional roller coaster. Didn't expect non-stop bleeding_ since I took the pill in my 20's and had very light periods. My physician said the shot is more to thin the lining of the uterus to make the procedure easier. After 3 months_ for birth control_ she suggested another shot until tubal blockage is confirmed. I told her I will chose absentince over more hormones of any kind!  I don't think this doctor gets a cut in $ because I picked up the presription at the pharmacy. My brother_ a Physician's assistant_ says women get fat on this shot.

That is the only reason I got depo and they push it or poor minority peolple. I hate like hell I got that poison in me. There should be a class action law suit regarding this drug.

1365, 4, dont want kids or my period,Slight spotting a cpl weeks after my first shot. Some moodiness and emotional changes but not bad.,I havent been on depo long but so far im liking it. My sister has been on it for years and has never had any problems these other women have had. 1st of all_ it can make you gain weight...IF youre not active. All birth control puts you at a higher risk of a stroke. And some of you need to give it more time. Its a new thing for your body not to have its period every month so you cant expect NO period right after you get the shot..give it a little time. It seems like some of the symptoms these women put have to do with something else and not the shot. I agree it can cause vaginal dryness and loss of sex drive..but there are ways around that. I like the shot and will continue to use it.,F,24,2  months,12/19/2008,Depo-provera

The one down side was when I stopped the shot_ I had cramps so bad I ended up in the hospital. That should have been a sign however I am not interested in having more children and began the process for permanent birth control which involved using some type of hormonal assistance.  I never remembered to take BC regularly so I figured the shot was a safe option.  Wrong answer.  I have been spotting everyday since October 29 that approximately 54 days just shy of two months.  So I  accomplished my goal permanent birth control because I am not comfortable having sex while I continue to ""adjust"".

THEN - i got in a serious relationship and needed to take it constantly (ive been on depo for about 5yrs with 1 yr break to try ortho evra. at first i had no weight gain. I was full timer at age 21 then started the weight gain_ nausea(this is serious)I'd be in the middle of eating (in which im hungry all the time) and feel like i need to throw up. Less sex drive vaginal dryness,I love having no period but the weight gain_ nausea and mood swings are unbearable. i weighed 115 at graduation_ i didn't gain weight then probably because i was so active. when the side effects started getting worse i switched to ortho evra lost some weight was was down to 125 Ive been back on depo this last year and i now weigh 138.

A day after I got the shot I noticed immediate side effects_ and I was miserable. When I asked her if she had given me an involuntary abortion_ she called and said oh_ your results are back and they are negative. Which personally_ I think Is a lie. Either way_ this shot should be outlawed in all 50 states. It has been black box labeled by the FDA_ which means it can cause potential life threatening risks. The shot is painful to your body_ causes through the roof irregularities_ gives you un necessary aches and pains when you can get on Mirena or the pill and have no side effects.

Shame on me for not really researching prior to getting treated_ but even the warnings on the packaging right from the pharmacy state that this ""should only be used as a last resort method for birth control when no other method works_ and it is not recommended for extended use beyond two years.""

I can't say about the vaginal dryness as it could be due to me being 46_ my blood sugars_ or the depo. However a little KY solves that.

1414, 1, prevent pregnancy,severe lack of sex drive and vaginal dryness so that i actually dreaded the thought of having sex with my boyfriend as i couldn't bear him to come near me_ extreme irritability and depression and spotting throughout most of the 3 months i was on depo. The irritability was the worst side effect for me since i am a very laid back person_ nothing fazes me but it got to the point where i had to sit with my ipod on at work all day long to shut everything out as every single little thing annoyed me to the point i would feel a rage building up inside of me which i have never in my life experienced! Unlike most people on depo though_ i didn't gain any weight,i came off the depo after only 3 months due to the side effects and expected them to disappear after stopping it. They didn't! the irritability continued although i am getting back to my old self now. I also experienced more symptoms coming off depo than i did on it. I have been off depo for over 6 months and during the past 3 months i have experienced pregnancy symptoms such as cramping_ severe nausea_ fatigue_ acne (i have never had spots before)_ bloating and the most intense cravings for food (mostly chocolate) which i struggle to keep under control and have only managed to keep my weight down by jogging / gym sessions 6 days a week. I know i am not pregnant_ I have done numerous pregnancy tests which where all negative. I can only assume this was the result of my hormones trying to get back to normal. The symptoms do now seem to be tailing off with only the odd bout of nausea now and sex drive is coming back. The only side effect i was warned about from my doctor was slight weight,F,31,3  months,11/2/2008,Depo-provera

However a month later I started havinf really bad headachs. I went to the doctor and he just told me that depo would cause bad headachs_ but what he did not tell me was that there is a 15% of women that may have strokes while taking depo. about 6months later I was at home and starting to have a bad headach and I sat down on my couch and about 2 minutes later I has fallinf over and could not stop myself and it lasted about 30 minutes were I had not control of my body. I went to the hospital and for the nex 8 week went throught a bunch of nasty tests.

I only menstruate if I wait too long to get my shot when it's due.  My last period was 7/29 and I got my shot 7/31.  It was light and only stayed on a few days.  I am Black and my hair gets very oily nowadays_ but that's no problem because my hair is growing like wildfire!  I am on the think side and wouldn't mind gainaing a few pounds......that's the one side effect that I want that I haven't gotten.

I stopped having periods all together and thought it was great. I am now 26_ the gynocologist told me that my body had ZERO estrogen b/c of the depo shot_ so it was like I was going thru menopause. Sex is very uncomfortable while on the shot since your body stops producing estrogen_ you cannot ""lubricate"" on your own. My new gynocologist immediately took me off the shot and was shocked that I was on it for so long. She said_ ""hopefully your ovaries will start workin again... we'll have to keep running tests"". So now_ I'm having to go back to the gyno on a monthly basis to get blood work done to see if my estrogen levels are going back up and to see if my ovaries will ""work again"".

I do not recommend it to ANY women_ ANY age. If you do not have at least 5 of the side effects_ you will have a couple. It can take up to a year for the drug to be completely out of your system.

1435, 1, Stop excessive menstrual bleeding,LOST MY MIND!  Caused severe depression.  Later_ after taking the depo_ here is what I learned:I took the Depo to combat my heavy periods.  I had heavy periods because I had no natural progesterone in my body.  I had no natural progesterone in my body because I put my body under major stress.  The biggest mistake I made in my life was OVERDIETING.  NEVER DO LOW CARB DIETING OR IT WILL MESS UP YOUR ENDOCRINE SYSTEM!  I eventually healed from the depo.  Also_ don't take any so called bio-identical progesterone to counter the depo.  ALL HORMONAL birth control causes some sort of whackadoodle change in your emotions and brain chemistry.  Depo Provera is just the most dramatic_ and most evil.  Depo actually stresses out your system.,You can actually have your stress levels tested by checking your adrenals.  If you are looking to heal from Depo_ you must heal your adrenals.  It takes time; there is no magic elixir or potion or pill.  You can expect to feel normal again in about 9 months to 18 months from the date of the shot.  Get your adrenals tested: www.diagnostechs.comso you have a gauge on exactly how much your system is stressed out.,F,39,90  days,9/28/2008Email,Depo-provera

The pain was so severe that I sometimes passed out. The doctors tried various things and one finally decided that Depo might work and it was a life saver. I had one doctor do some research for me on the bone loss over long term use and he found that the risk is in a small percentage of the population. This drug isn't for everyone but for some of us it is all that will work. Do be careful and pay attention to your body.

And having no periods anymore is WONDERFUL.My biggest complaint would have to be the decreased sex drive.

I did not gain any weight on the depo_ but know women who have. Also the nurse that gave me the shot said she went nuts on depo. And I have a girlfriend who has a friend that is in a lawsuit due to the shot.,I would try YAZ before depo. Although for a year I felt it was GREAT_ however the effects after 2 1/2 years are NOT so great. It is not natural to not have a period_ my body aches all the time and I seem to always 'feel bad' one way or another ...

I'm 24 years old and haven't had my period for 18 months_ literally_ no spotting or anything. I never get any cramps_ bloating_ etc. My sex drive has INCREASED. My appetite has not changed. And my boobs got bigger. No negative side effects for me at all except for a SLIGHT weight gain. I've been on this shot for nearly 2 years and I've only gained 5 pounds_ but I also eat like a truck driver so I can't even be sure where the weight came from lol. Also_ some of that weight went to my breasts. A 32AA is now a 32A. It may not sound like much_ but to those of us in the itty-bitty-titty-committee (lol!) it's a huge difference. I have had nothing but a fantastic experience with this shot.,I have read everywhere that you should not get this shot for more than 2 years as it MAY increase your loss of bone density. I'm approaching 2 years and my doctor is a bit hesitant to continue giving me this shot_ but I will do pretty much anything to keep getting it. I'll tremendously increase my calcium intake_ do weight-bearing exercises_ etc. Whatever I have to do to keep getting it. It's fantastic.,F,24,18  months,9/14/2008,Depo-provera
1442, 1, birth control,EXCESSIVE BLEEDING! Hair loss_ moodiness_ low sex drive_ fatigue_ dizziness,The only good thing I have to say about this bc method is that I did not gain weight_ but I had every other symptom. I got my first shot in January and about a week afterward started spotting. I thought nothing of it_ but I called my doctor after it had went on for nearly 2 months. Doc said that this would stop after the second shot_ but instead the bleeding increased. I pretty much had a light to moderate period for nearly 6 months!!!! As a result I was always tired and started having dizzy spells. I was due to get my last shot in July and did not get it_ yet I am still experiencing the dizziness. Now doc suspects that I am anemic. On top of all of this_ I had excessive hair loss_ which started out as more than normal shedding then increased to my hair coming out in patches. I had to get my past shoulder length hair cut to a short_ spiky style_ and my hair has still not totally recovered. Don't even get me started on the mood swings that ranged from me being extra sensitive to me bein,F,25,6  months,9/12/2008,Depo-provera

My period stopped all together which I didn't mind_ but I was still getting bad cramping. I got bad headaches and my joints and muscles hurt all the time_ I had NO patience for my baby and my friends and family said I was very moody and on edge all the time. I stopped getting the depo shot before my 3rd shot_ and it has been 2 years and I have only had my period once since then_ I still get bad cramps and joint pain_ I haven't been able to lose the weight even after following a strict diet my doctor put me on_ My Doctor said there are steroids in the shot that I didn't know about before I started taking it_ and that's why I had such weight gain.

It was a few weeks after i got the shot that I began to slowly change_ and I feel like I dont even know myself anymore.

1445, 4, No more children for me!,I first tried the Depo shot when I was 17 and went off it due to a constant period that last for 7 months. This time around was different...in the beginning I had the hot flashes_ acne that wouldn't go away_ nervousness_ and headaches. I also started spotting the same day I got the shot..spotted for about 8 days. I had horrible mood swings and would cry for no reason at all. My poor boyfriend was getting frustrated with me. I told everyone I wasn't going to get another shot..it was horrible!,The worst side effects lasted for about 3 to 5 weeks and I have had basically no side effects since then. I lost 11 lbs in the first three months. I have no period..no spotting either. I still have the mood swings_ but I just try to laugh them off. I still cry a lot more than I am used to_ but again I try to just deal with it. It's much easier on the Depo..no pills to remember everyday! I wouldn't trade it for the world! I just got my latest shot and there will be more to come! If I got through the side effects_ you can too! You just have to want to get through it.,F,23,3  months,9/5/2008,Depo-provera
1446, 1, birth control,i THOUGHT that the only side effect was no period_ which was awesome and why i stayed on it so long. now i look at what everyone has said and i realize that there are too many coincidences. the effects that i have in common with others are: unstable mood swings_ feelings of depression_ lack of sex drive_ dryness_ painful sex_ horrible night swears. ALSO now have been diagnosed w/ OSTEOPENIA,I feel sick to my stomach when I look at what everyone is saying and actually thinking that I could get away with not having a period for almost 10 years and not having other side effects. I have been diagnosed with osteopenia (low bone mass density_ now at risk for osteoporosis) and ONLY found out b/c my Best friend was diagnosed and told me to get a test-not even my DOCTOR told me anything. i have been in denial and now i know that i not only HAVE to get off it to try to reverse the osteopenia_ but hopefully I won't feel unhappy_ unstable_ and will get my sex drive back. PLEASE be careful of the side effects and don't get caught up in the thrill of no periods like i did. only take short term and/or if you are going to be sure to take the calcium supplements to make up for the calcium the depo leeches from you. this didn't work for me b/c the whole reason i took the shot was b/c i couldn't remember to take a little pill. . .,F,27,10  years,9/2/2008,Depo-provera

On Depo Provera_ they were longer and more painful. Tired_ nauseated_ sore breasts_ constant bleeding that wouldn't stop.,"One shot was enough. Do your research before you decide to take the shot.

1453, 5, Birth Control,Very slight weight gain,I am 47 and decided on depo provera last year since I previously had breast cancer and most forms of birth control not an option for me.  Depo has no estrogen so I decided to try it on my physician's recommendation.  Had continuous brown spotting for the first 3 months on it which was extremely annoying_ but after that_ no side effects to speak of.  I originally weighed 113 lbs when I started the depo_ and after a year and a half weigh 117 lbs so not really sure that my slight weight gain is a direct result of the shot. I really like the convenience of a shot every 3 months and have none of the numerous side effects most posters here have written about.  I would highly recommend this as an effective_ easy form of birth control.,F,48,1.5  years,8/14/2008,Depo-provera

1456, 1, to control bleeding,I have to buy new clothes every couple of weeks because my weight gain is so rapid; about 2-4 lbs every two weeks.  I've gained about 20 pounds in total.  By the end of the day_ I'm so bloated that I can't get even baggy clothes off.  I suddenly have acne all over my face and I've always had excellent skin.  I have no interest in sex and it has severely worsened my depression. Lastly_ in the first eight weeks after my first shot_ I was fine for two and bled for six weeks: I spent $200 on tampons in that time period.,I had surgery for endometriosis and went on the shot after the surgery failed to control my bleeding. I would rather bleed and have pain than go through this-the weight gain is disgusting.  Most people gain about 10 lbs in the first year; I gained that in about a month.,F,23,4  months,8/11/2008,Depo-provera

I gained 23 pounds in 6 months even though none of my eating habits changed. I have vaginal dryness and NO sex drive.,The only good thing about depo is i have only had one period and it was right after my first shot.  It may work for some_ but im not getting the shot again.,F,29,5  months,8/7/2008Email,Depo-provera
1458, 2, no periods,boils_ headaches_ vision problems_leg cramps_ stomach cramps_ irritable bowel_ tired_ no desire for sex,I was on the depo shot for 6 years and had my last shot (ever!) in June 08. The first 4 & 1/2 years were fairly problem free. I gained weight (50 lbs) but can't say it's due to the shot_ as I like to eat and was already heavy. I added a lot of girth around the middle and look more pregnant than I did when I actually was pregnant. I've weighed this much in the past and my body shape has been curvy rather than middle heavy. In the last year and a half I began to get boils on my butt and upper thighs. At first it was only once in awhile but that led to having several at all times and horrible scars. I also began to have stomach problems_ cramping and frequent bowel movements. In the last six months headaches and vision issues have come into play. I continued to deny that the depo was the cause of the things going on with my body. Coming to this website really opened my eyes. I'll never get another depo shot and surely hope the side effects don't linger for too long!,F,40,6  years,8/7/2008,Depo-provera

Beacuse of this_ or possibly as another sdie effect I was not warned about_ I have lost all interest in sex. I have also gained about 5 lbs in 2 months with no change in my diet. I cry all the time and my boyfriend is understandably getting frustrated. I went on this to stop my periods and have a safer more spontaneous sex life_ but instead I've been bleeding for almost two months and am not having any sex. Do not take this medication!

Most of these women are VERY dissatisfied with the results_ but it hasn't been all that bad for me.  All of the side effects mentioned are listed and well known...I'm mainly giving it up as a result of the headaches_ but the weight gain might be resolved as well.

I found that sex was painful and I had alot of pains in my arms and legs. I am coming to the end of the 3 months and I cant say that its not for everyone because you dont know unless you try it out urself but I have heard alot of bad comments than good but I will not be continuing the use due to trying for a baby in a few months which I hope the depo has not affected my chances.

I lost all my baby weight within the 6weeks after my daughters birth and within 2 months I gained over 30lbs.

I have headaches all the time_ and they just do not seem to go away. My stomach is always cramping up_ as well as my shoulders and neck. This shot is horrible. Take a look at all the side effects.

During this time I managed to lose all the weight I gained (with exercise) and then some since I no longer have much of an appetite. My moodiness is just now starting to go away (my husband is very excited about that one). I also experienced about three months straight of nausea and extreme fatigue but I haven't had a problem with that for about four months. Oh_ and my sex drive has come back.

Since my last appointment on 5th June_ i've had the brown discharge constantly and it started 5 weeks before i had the injection. I'm newly married and this is starting to cause problems_ i still have a high sex drive but my husband isn't too keen to get in a mess and who can blame him! Its embarrassing! Not going to have another shot but don't know what to try next_ worried if i try something more permanent such as the implant or the coil i'll have the same problem.,F,21,18  months,7/1/2008,Depo-provera
1480, 5, birth control_ ovarian cycts,fairly steady headaches_ constant spotting for first year followed by none at all_ sex drive DIED_ dryness during sex_ Gained about 30 lbs_ acne_ very painful (albeit much larger) breasts.,I loved it honestly. I knew what i was getting into with the weight gain_ bone density loss_ and acne. so I counteracted that with increased excercise_ calcium suppliments and proactive. the lack of sex drive did suck_ but as i am single_ i suppose it probably kept me out of making a bad decision or two :)lol. the dryness when i did have sex is an easy fix. Kama Sutra makes an amazingly natural feeling lubricant. the only problem I have is that I feel that I should get off of it and let my natural cycle happen once in a while. The first time i did this everything returned to clockwork immediately. I even became pregnant within about 3 months (although i wound up misscarrying). Which dealing with that was enough to put me back on the shot and it was like i never got off it. no spotting whatsoever this time. except now i've hit that 2 year mark again and i've been off since feb of this year and NOTHING. No period. No weight change. Acne is still and issue. My sex drive is back_ but other,F,25,6  years,6/30/2008Email,Depo-provera

We've argued again all morning and he's getting sick of it!  & I dont blame him - he's put up with it for 9 months now!!  And he's not the only one who's sick of it!  I just can't cope anymore & WONT be getting another injection when it's due!  Aside from the mood swings & depression there's the greasy skin & worsening spots!  Hot flushes (especially at night)_ I'm so angry & cry at the slightest thing_ I am very dry & need LOADS of lube to attempt sex!  And that is when I even want it!  ... well_ I dont want it - he wants it so I oblige!!!   It's been the worst 9 months of my life!!!!!!!!,Think twice before you try this form of contraception!!  If you like your life the way it is now then DONT put this inside you!  you'll definately not get pregnant_ cos you'll NOT want to have sex - & if your boyfriend doesnt understand you'll be single anyway!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,F,23,9  months,6/28/2008,Depo-provera

Tiredness all the time. No energy. Increased appetite. Now I have finished the Depo and its been 5 months since my last injection - still very bad skin and irregularly bleeding,I am a 22 year old girl_ never suffered spots or any kind of skin problems. Always had normal skin_ would probably get like one spot per month_ at the most. Oh My God how that changed after having the depo_ suddenly i have obsenenely oily skin_ especially my chin. Break outs every day_ horrible blocked pores...nothing will prevent these spots. Have tried EVERYTHING. Also the injection totally ruined my sleep patterns_ I would wake up at 3/4 AM and not be able to go back to sleep sow ould be constantly tired. Felt low all the time and my poor boyfriend thought I had gone off him as suddenly my usually high sex drive had reduced to NIL. I know everyones body reacts differently but I regret the day I ever had the Depo and I just pray that its out of my system soon (Dr says my skin could be bad for another 18 months as thats how long Depo can take in some circumstances to be out of your sytem),F,22,6  months,6/17/2008,Depo-provera

I have been having dark brown to bright red wierd smelling bleeding for 9 months. My doctor keeps telling me the bleeding will go away the more shots i get. I run every day and have always had a healthy diet so i havnt expierienced wieght gain or loss. I have been having extremly sore hips_ lower back pain_ shoulder_ neck_ inner and outer thigh pain all from depo. The only way to not feel so stiff in the morning is to go for a run. I have to walk on my tippy toes in the morning because my hips are so sore. My sexdrive has increased but since i am always bleeding my self esteem has decreased.

1487, 5, birth control,READ IF YOU WANT TO QUIT BLEEDING,i received my first shot while on my period. Because of the shot_ my period never stopped. the bleeding became lighter and darker and would often have clotts in it...this was very aggravating. I called my docter after two weeks of getting the injection and she informed me that taking a light birth control pill(i used ortho tricycline lo) for a month would help the bleeding. She said that the shot was too strong for my body and the pill would weaken it (though not enough to get pregnant) to help my body get used to the shot. my bleeding quit after one week of taking an oral contraceptive (along with depo) and has been normal ever since. my doctor's office gave me a sample pack of pills so i wouldn't have to buy another form of birth control. medication react different for everyone so additionally taking an oral contraceptive may not help everyone.,F,19,6  months,6/10/2008,Depo-provera

I had extremely bad periods and they put me through rounds of different birth control and other medications and gave me depo as a last resort. I absolutely love it and feel it has been a big life saver. It does work differently for everybody but I feel a lot of people blame other symptoms on depo that are not even related!! I did experience some minor headaches and then realized a lot of it had to do with my eye sight going bad_ once I was off depo the headaches continued until I had an eye exam....I did experience a little weight gain which I learned to control by eating better and exercising regularly. I had a slight loss in sex drive but I just took a medication that helped fix that because I pretty much require Depo to function... It is recommended to take breaks every 2 years from it and during that year break I am so miserable my periods pretty much stop my life and I am bed ridden.

Also spotting occurs after a lot sex sometimes and often occurs after a shower(?). I did have one time where I had a period for a month though_ which was horrible. The doctors said it was just a ""cycle of bleeding"" and offered no relief. Besides that I never had real serious side affects_ headaches were common at first but went away with time. I also LOST WEIGHT on depo... I was 185 when I started 2 years ago and now I'm 140_ but this may be due to other factors as well_ I'm just trying to point out that I never had the weight gain that some women complain of.",I like depo_ its very easy to manage and the issue of BC and pregnancy isn't constantly lingering in my mind.

And only a $15 office copay every 3 months vs. $25/mo for the pill was great.  The only down fall is that I could only be on it for a max of 2 years due to the potential for bone density loss.

1517, 3, birth control_ weight gain,weight gain_ depression_ acne_ no period.,I actually was prescribed the pill due to my low weight.  I have medical problems that cause extreme weight loss.  This shot fixed that- I definitely gained weight very fast.  However_ my doctor did not warn me of other side effects_ the worst being acne for me.  There was some depression_ but I don't know if that was due to the pill or other medical news I received around the same time.  But I definitely gained a lot of weight and my face is covered in acne that I can't seem to get rid of.  On the plus side_ no periods- and my bleeding had been terrible on both seasonique and apri (apri completely cleared my skin of acne as a plus_ though).,F,26,3  months,4/6/2008Email,Depo-provera
1518, 1, Birth Control_ Severe Cramps,I received my first shot 4 days before Christmas 2007. For the first 2 weeks_ I was fine. Then I started having stomach problems - it felt like someone was squeezing my stomach as hard as they could. That transitioned into cramps_ 3 weeks of spotting_ *severe* anxiety and panic attacks (I've been on an anti-depressant with great results for 3 years_ and my doctor had to double it recently just so I could function on a daily basis)_ heart palpitations_ gas_ 20lb. weight loss_ and absolutely no energy or drive to do anything_ and hair loss. Some of my friends have loved this_ but any medication that relies on a huge shot of hormones into your body can't be good. I didn't receive my second shot_ but almost a month after I was due_ I'm still experiencing horrible side effects on a daily basis.,,F,24,1  times,4/3/2008Email,Depo-provera

I am getting my master's and this has pretty much ruined my life. Now I have to see a detox specialist and am seeing a therapist for depression (that was never there before). There are no outside influences that could have caused all this_ and although ti was a relief to find out that I wasn't going crazy_ now I have to deal with the consequences...,DO NOT TAKE THIS (if you like your life the way it is now),F,26,1  days,4/2/2008Email,Depo-provera

It had no effect on my sexual drive or my bone density.,LOVE this drug. I would recommend it to anyone. However I do think that each person reacts differently to the shot.

Then over about 6 mo to 1 year_ 30lb weight gain. Even tho I'm more active than I've ever been and have never had weight issues before. No matter what I eat or do_ weight keeps creeping up!! Doc recommended I go off it for a bit and I doubt I'll go back on. Having been off it for almost 4 mo. I feel a bit of sex drive again. Thank god I have a patient and loving husband. Have dropped a few pounds. Anyway_ I tried giving it the benefit of the doubt_ but I do believe that the aforementioned symptoms were caused by the shot. I'm not convinced that it is necessarily evil_ but also_ not very convinced it is the best thing for you. I definitely had a lot of odd things going on with my body that seem to be subsiding_ now that I am no longer taking the shots. I'm on the pill and will probably stay there. Plus there is the bone density loss thing. Not good.,F,43,2  years,4/1/2008,Depo-provera

I wasnt aware of all of the effects when my first shot was administrated_ and if I would've been more knowledgeable_ I would have NEVER taken this.

She also said that I had to educate myself because if I had a negative reaction it is stuck in my body for 3+ months.

Since I didn't have many options to choose from and she recomended the shot over the other forms for me_ I agreed.

I switched to Depo and to my horror I bled everyday for two months_ it ruined all of my nice underwear and I lived in pantliners. That's the secret behind its contraceptive power_ no one wants to have sex with a woman on her period! These were actually the least alarming side effects_ I also experienced skull throbbing headaches as well as fatigue and I began having sharp pains in my stomach. I was complaining one day to my friend_ who is also on depo and she shared many of my symptoms. We both then discontinued the shot and have never felt better.

It affects some people badly but for others_ stick through the side effects because after a few shots_ they will go away.

WHEN Im in the mood great but it seems to only last a few minutes and then Im so done. My sex life has suffered tremendously. I am now engaged to be married in September of 2008 and we would like to have children. The only problem with that is depo prevents me from even being able to get pregnant for atleast the next 9-10 months. So after the better part of a year we can START trying to have our own family. The weight gain is very deppressing for me too. I was a size 9 and 4 years after I started depo I am now a size 20 and I have a few other problems.

These are all symptoms of pregnancy which is what the drug is designed to do- trick your body into thinking it is pregnant. I was educated that I could experience some bleeding_ but usually after the 3rd shot you are ok. I would suggest taking vitamins if you are experiencing exhaustion.

I started on a pill_ but when my period exceeded 2 weeks I became frustrated and demanded something else be tried.  I was warned that it might not work_ but I didn't care.  It actually worked very successfully for me.  I have pretty much been on Depo for over 4 years.  I love it_ even if I wasn't married and sexually active I would continue with it.  It's nice not worrying about your cycle and the discomfort assosiated with it.  I thought that it was decreasing my sex drive_ but since I got out of the Navy a few weeks ago and my stress levels are decreased and I'm not working 50+ hours a weeks while going to school full time_ that's changed dramatically.  It's not for everyone_ but it's definately for me.,F,23,4  years,11/6/2007,Depo-provera

It's like I'm on my period constantly_ though fortunately I haven't experienced any spotting yet (though I'm only a couple of weeks into it). I'm currently taking antidepressants for obsessive-compulsive disorder and the side effects of this shot seem to be cancelling out the benefits of that medication. Ugh. I probably won't go back for another shot unless I see an improvement. And I don't think it's a good sign when you feel really dizzy and shaky only an hour after getting the shot.

I had my daughter and got right back on the shot when she was 6 weeks old. I do suggest to eat foods high in vitamins and calcium. I also suggest taking a ""break"" from the shot from time to time.

I feel like I have gone off my boyfriend and cannot tolerate any of his 'flaws' which before never bothered me. THis in itself makes things worse because it upsets me so much to think like that. I get irritated at the slightest thing anyone does_ keep getting hot flushes_ especially at night_ and my skin is a mess compared to how it normally is! I had depression before and this has just worsened it significantly. I will NOT be getting the second jab as it has messed with my head way too much- im supposed to be having my 30th birthday party next week and it upsets me that im probably gonna still feel this sh** when it comes round.

I did get pregnant at 30 miscarried told just a percentage. Then got pregnant at 31 miscarried. Finally doc start to investigate.

1651, 1, Birth Control,weight gain_ loss of sex drive_ acne,I went on depo after having my daughter in October 2005.  My doctor recommended it since I was breast feeding.  At first I really liked it. Then I noticed that I was gaining weight(after losing all of the baby weight) and had very little sex drive. I just attributed this to motherhood and change of hormones after pregnancy. I also always seemed to have at least one big pimple on my face which was not normal for me.  my last shot was near the end of January 2007 and the good news is my face cleared up immediately but I still have not had a period since the shot wore off in April.  We are trying to have another baby and have no idea how long it will take. Hopefully not too much longer.  I WOULD NOT recommend this shot for anyone who wants to pregnant soon after stopping the shot.  I have been very frustrated this summer and never plan to go on the shot again.

I am gettting a bone scan as soon as possible and hoping that all my years of walking walking walking (weight bearing exercise) will be in my favor.

(started so long ago_ can't remember)  Pills had me lying in the floor crying.  They had taken Norplant off the market_ and the idea of glass under my skin spooked me.  I'm now over 40_ so weight gain can't all be blamed on Depo_ but I know it's responsible for about 10 lbs worth.  No periods in a decade.  Can you top that???  No bleeding_ no PMS_ no cramps_ no surprise pregnancies.  Miracle drug_ as far as I'm concerned.  I am now level headed and not a jumpy bag of hormones every month.  No mood swings.  I refuse to take calcium_ as I have had a kidney stone in the past_ so going for a dexascan later this month.  You MUST watch your bone density.  Long term_ depo can affect bone density and it's not 100% reversible.

1717, 3, Birth Control,weight gain_ loss of sex drive,I took depo for about 9 years.  I realized I was gaining weight but the lack of a menstrual cycle made it worth it.  I have been off it for 3 yrs. Now i need to have some cervical tissue removed that may be cancerious. No idea if depo had anything to do with it_ but now I question my decision to stay on it for so long.,F,31,9  days,5/29/2007Email,Depo-provera

Within the first month I began to have problems with my knees and hips. By the second month I had lost 5lbs_ which isn't normal considering I only weighed 116lbs. Now its been almost a year and i've lost 5 more lbs and suffer from extreme indigestion and take lots of medications. I was a very healthy 21 yr. old when i got this shot and now I suffer from physical ailments of someone over 40.

This shot is causing nothing but trouble_ its put my realtionship with my boyfriend on rocky ground because everything he does irritates me. which it never used to untill I got this. I can hardly stand for long cause my left ankle and knee hurt so bad_ and my left wrist aches so much I try to avoid using it. ONly 2 more months of this crap.

1721, 5, Pain management,difficulty in loosing weight when i do gain it.,I've been on the shots for 8 years. I would not give them up for anything! I have always had extreme menstral pain_ then in 1998 diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  Not only has the shots eliminated my periods (god send)I don't have to deal with the excruciating pain of a period which was adding to the pain of the Firbomyalgia. My Fibro pain has decreased significately as well. I've rollercoastered with weight all my life_ so it's just a little harder. For me IT'S WORTH IT!  I have my tubes tied_ I'm a single mom and grandma and yes I have absolutely no sex drive which for me works. It lets me focus on my kids.  I'd rather be a little overweight and single than suffer all that pain again!,F,44,8  years,5/22/2007,Depo-provera

Her comments to me basically implied that everything I told her was down to me and not the side effects of the drug.  She was very reluctant to not give it me.

You are warned that you may put on weight but not that it will continue.  My sex drive is zero.  I hate it_ I am due to have my next shot in 2 days but I am not going to have it_ however_ I am very worried about what side effects will happen once I stop taking it.  The only good thing is that I don't have babies or periods.  If I could turn back the clock to when this drug was offered to me I would not take it again.,F,38,4  years,5/19/2007,Depo-provera
1725, 3, painful periods,I have acne and mood swings (less than with my period) depression but not sure if it is b/c of shot or life. I have had weight gain but that was (I thought) from the anti-depressants I was on. Not b/c of the shot but b/c of some taumatic things in my life. I'm off of the anti-depressants and did lose 20 lbs_ but can't seem to lose the other 30 lbs. I did have a bone density test and its very low_ not quit osteoporosis but getting there. No sex drive_ but I thought it was b/c of some stuff I'd been through not b/c of the shot.,I'm thinking about stopping the shot_ given my bone density and what I've read here. But I have extremely painful periods and heavy bleeding. This shot has been a godsent for that. I also have horrible mood swings and become suicidal when I get my periods_ not to mention that me family doesn't dare go near me for a week before and during my period. I'm am scared to stay on it_ but the alternative (having my period) is very bad for me too.  I hate the thought of having a period again. I'd almost rather die than have to go through what it is that I go through. I'm just at a loss.  Please if anyone has any thoughts on what I could do to help with the period symptoms I would appreciate you input.,F,36,10  years,5/19/2007Email,Depo-provera

Not only that_ I am so emotional_ and it's a big strain on my relationship with my boyfriend.  This is a horrible drug.

From that one shot - I didn't get a period until 26 months later!  It was incredibly hard to concieve again.  It took another  22 months  after I got a period until I started ovulating and got pregnant again - I charted my cycle and my doctor was even puzzled as well.,I think it is a horrible drug!  I warn everyone I know not to get the depo shot!!!!  If I could do it again - I wouldn't.  It changed our plans for our family.  We hoped to have several children 2 years apart.

I did suffer sugar cravings but I had researched and depo contains an appetite suppressant.,I am 37 and was diagnosed with osteopenia in Aug.06.

I had a period last month and have not had one yet this month so I can start the pill.  I really enjoyed the depo injection but osteoporosis runs in my family 3 generations ahead of me so my best choice is to come off the shot.

They also told me that I would stop having my period.  I have horrendous periods_ so this was the miracle cure for me.  They warned me_ like with any birth control_ that I would need to consider taking some sort of calcium supplement and that I would gain a considerable amount of weight.  I had actually just recently lost 70 lbs and had a healthy diet plan at the time_ so that did not phase me.  I was taking the shot for a total of 2 years and I have been off of it for almost a year.  Within the time that I came off the shot I have gained all of the weight that I had lost back (within about 4 months) and I am showing all of the symptoms of being pregnant without being pregnant.

Every single time I had intercourse with my husband_ or even without penetration_ I would bleed_ and I don't mean a little bit_ enough that it was a major concern.  I talked to my doctor about it_ and she said that it couldn't be the Depo-Provera that was doing it_ but after many tests to find nothing wrong_ I chose not to get the next shot.

1771, 2, Birth control alternative to pills,Non-stop bleeding_ mood swings,I have been on depo for 2 months.  I wanted to get an IUD but the planned parenthood wouldn't do an IUD because I haven't had children and it could rip my uterine wall? and I wouldn't be able to have children which to me was an acceptable risk.  Now I can't even have intercourse because I have been bleeding non-stop for a month.  I have had terrible mood swings and have recently lost my boyfriend of a year because he didn't understand why I was in such a bad mood.  Of course_ I didn't understand either.  Now I'm upset_ depressed and would have rather had an IUD and risked never having children which I don't really want anyway.

While I've been lucky enough to bypass the hair loss/weight gain/etc._ I HAVE BEEN SPOTTING NON STOP FOR ALMOST A YEAR. I'm off the shot now and I don't know when this is going to stop.

I was told I would gain around 5 pounds and might have some irregular bleeding_ well...that was the least of my problems. I did gain 5 pounds_ the water retention made me miserable_ mood swings were rediculous and uncontrollable_ the depression effected me just as much as it did the people I loved_ and I almost lost my boyfriend of 2 years because of it. When I didnt show up for my last shot I felt relieved_ and thought my life would finally start to go back to normal. It didnt. I am still gaing weight and i still get mood swings.

I wouldn't doubt if this shot has driven women to commit suicide_ but we'll never know.  The thought has crossed my mind several times.  It ruins your health and your life.  They say that the side effects could last for years after you stop the shot.  I've been off it for 7 months and still have the side effects PLUS my period is out of control.  My first period after stopping the shot lasted 5 months and it was very heavy and the water retention was horrible in my legs and feet.  I had to buy shoes and sneakers a whole size bigger because my feet were so swollen.

Yay_ I thought it was great. Then during the 3rd month I started experiencing extreme cramping like I've never felt. I went back for my appt to get the shot again_ I talked to the clinician at Planned Parenthood and they told me ""everything should be fine. Cramping is normal."" Well it wasn't normal for me but I trusted that I'd be ok since the clinician said so...therefore I got the shot again. Bad idea! I am due now for the shot but I will not get it again. During these last three months I have not had the mood swings like the previous shot nor the cramping but_ I have had my period for 2 months straight. Since 02/04/07.

After he was born_ I started taking Depo again. I decided to come off 8 mths ago_ because I have been going through a body detoxing and I didn't want any synthetic chemicals in my body. It is funny because I didn't realize any of the side effects until after I stop taking the shot. They were not severe that I would have stopped taking the shot before I did. I loved not having a period. Before the shot I weighed about 115 lbs(19) but at my highest on Depo I weighed 160 at 5'5"" (29). Since I have stopped Depo_ I have lost about 15 lbs in about 4 mths_ and that is with eating healthier (not a diet/no exercise). One thing that stunned me was I have had acne since I was 13_ so having acne as an adult really did not faze me. Then_ once I stopped taking Depo_ 4 to 6 months down the line my face cleared up.

1806, 3, Birth Control,I have experienced many of the side-effects.  I did not educate myself well enough beforehand to be aware of them - But I had unexplained lower back pain_ acne as an adult that I never suffered from before_ skin irritation_ severe mood swings and major disinterest in sex.  While I didn't gain weight at first_ I later gained about 10 pounds and have major carb cravings.,The shot did stop me from having a period which initially is very nice.  But after a while I felt I needed to get back in touch with my  natural cycles.  It just seems so unnatural to not have a period at all and then have all the side effects as well.  I plan on detoxing to try and clear my system.  I wouldn't do the shot again.  I encourage anyone considering it to seriously weight the pros and cons.,F,27,2  years,3/14/2007,Depo-provera
1807, 1, My sister became a teenage mother,"The only good thing about being on ""the shot"" was that it did stop my periods_ but it caused severe anxiety and panic attacks that i had never experienced before taking depo provera. I was taken off ""the shot"" due to the damage it was doing to my heart. I do not recommend depo provera to any woman though it is nice not to have a cycle the side effects and long term future damage is not worth it and in some cases lose of a life in an attempt not to make another.",,F,20,4  days,3/14/2007Email,Depo-provera

1809, 1, Birth Control,Bled 6 months nonstop_ joint pain(hip)_ weight gain 35 lbs_ very moody and depressed,I had to take Motrin to stop the bleeding to even get a pap smear because the bleeding would not stop. My husband was so afraid for me because we kept waiting for it to stop. I gained weight in places I have never had weight. I had 2 babies and my body was never like it is now!!!I exercised twice a day and never lost a pound. 2 years later I'm still trying to lose the weight_ I still have 15 lbs to go. My stomach got so bloated if I had not been bleeding every day I would have thought I was pregnant. I thought it was a good idea_ so i wouldn't have to think about birth control so often. It's really tooo much medication to put in one's body at a time. Now I'm wondering what are the long term effects?  I should have listened to the horror stories!!,F,32,2  times,3/14/2007,Depo-provera

I have always been a depo pusher_ and recommended to anyone who had bad periods_ or were bad at taking the pill. But_ now I am worried. I thought there was maybe something wrong with my bladder_ but it realy seems to go hand in hand with taking my Depo. Scary!,F,30,4  years,3/11/2007,Depo-provera
1814, 5, Easier Method,Weight Gain_ Moodiness,Don't do it!!! It may be an easier method but it can leave you damaged. I took Depo and other than weight gain and moodiness was fine. Then i decided to stop it for the unhealthy weight gain. A year later my thyroid became inflammed_ keep in mind there are no family history of thyroid issues. So i got that under control. Then_ a year later and to this day i am stricken with anxiety_ slight depression_ not able to keep weight_ severe mood swings_ severe fatigue and worst of all i can't stand long enough to even cook. One doctor told me that the depo could have caused alot of problems. I say it's was too strong for our bodies_ u may feel fine now but coming off is where u learn what it's damaged. So take warning i've spent thousands of dollars on doctors and no explaination_ i can't even work_ so cherish your bodies and do the best thing for you.,F,23,1  years,3/10/2007,Depo-provera

I was fine the first month after the injection_ then I bled for the next two_ then it threw my menstrual cycle off for the following month_ during which I just continued to bleed without abatement.  Finally_ the doctor put me on 10 days of pill-based Depo_ and two days afterward_ the strange bleeding stopped and my regular period began.  I haven't bled in 2 weeks_ but I still have the bloating and weight gain.  Occasionally_ I find myself crying at the stupidest sentimentality_ which is not my usual m.o.,Don't take it.,F,39,4  months,3/8/2007,Depo-provera
1818, 4, To Stop Periods,Large weight gain_ decreased sexual desire,I have been on Depo for about 2 - 3 years. I started it as birth control but am no longer sexually active and remained on it because it supresses periods. Unfortunately I have gained about 16 pounds and have no sexual desire at all. I will stay on Depo until another drug is created to suppress periods.,F,20,2  years,3/7/2007,Depo-provera

1820, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain_ spotting_ severe mood swings_ muscle soreness.,I'm on Depo currently_ waiting for my last shot to wear off. I went from 145 lbs to 160 lbs. After the third shot I began to experience tons of spotting_ most of which was brown (almost black) blood. Very gross. I was extremely interested in having sex_ but the constant bleeding created a barrier. Luckily my boyfriend was very understanding and didn't mind the crazy mood swings. I'd get angry over the smallest things and then_ about five minutes later_ I'd start to cry uncontrollably for no reason. My neck also gave me a lot of problems_ I read that Depo can cause muscle soreness. Overall I'd say that this drug needs to be taken off of the market immediately_ especially after reading the other reviews on this site.,F,20,9  months,3/2/2007,Depo-provera

MY DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT THE SHOT WOULD STOP MY PERIODS. I wasn't told about the side effects or about all the controversy surrounding the Depo. I have not stopped bleeding since I received the shot Jan.19 causing me to be extremely tired. I have severe mood swings along with being depressed. I lost my job because I couldn't focus and I am irritated all the time. This is a warning to anyone considering the Depo shot_ read the warnings and side effects. I am amazed at the negative effects it has had. For some people_ no side effects occured but for others_ the side effects have greatly negatively impacted their lives. I'm not getting the second shot and I want to warn women thinking of the Depo to reconsider. Research all of the testimonies_ warnings and side effects so you can make the decision that is right for you. I wish I had!!!!!!,F,32,42  days,3/1/2007,Depo-provera

The first year and a half was fine_ then i started getting majorly depressed and gained a ton of weight and sex was so painful. I went off of the drug because of all the side effects. A year later_ I learned that I had aquired type 2 diabetes_ and because of the severity  and my age_ I was immediatly put on insulin_ which I will have to take for life. I've majorly changed my lifesytle and eating habits and have lost a ton of weight_ but the effects of the Depo still haunt me to this day. This crap should be removed from the market_ and it should not be given to teenage girls_ as it will wreck your bones and metabolism.

Depo cured all those problems and not having a period for more that 13 years now ( two consecutive pregnancies and births before starting Depo)has been FABULOUS!!!  My boyfriend loves that fact that I don't have to ""time-out"" for a week each month. I started out underweight so the initial weight gain (about 3 years in) did not bother me.  However_ now I have gained about 60 pounds total over almost 12 years_ and for that reason only am considering coming off for a while to get my weight under control.

I'm now taking a new pill called Cerazette - only been on it for 3 days so unsure of how successful it will be. I lost weight in the first year or so of taking the Depo_ but then gained about 40lbs or so in the second year. This could have something to do with lifestyle change as I started University. I managed to lose about 20 lbs_ but still struggle keeping the weight off. I have a history of depression and am concerned that this has been heightened since taking the Depo. My hair falls out loads_ a lot more than my friends. I also started going grey at the age of 23 and am wondering if that has anything to do with the Depo.

1841, 3, birth control,I took the generic version of depo for three years until April of 2005.  I experienced horrible acne across my back_ shoulders_ face & neck (I never had acne before).  I took tetracycline to control the acne but it was only moderately effective.  I also experienced eczema covering about 80% of my body.  I'm prone to eczema anyway_ so I feel it threw it into overdrive.  It was so bad it kept me awake all night.  I still have acne scars on my back.,Its been nine months since I was on it; the eczema is SLOWLY starting to go away.  The acne is GONE.  It also decreased my sex drive and increased my appetite.  I'm slowly losing weight (I gained 20 pounds and have lost about 4.)  I tried to exercise to reduce the weight but the heat and sweat irritated my eczema to the point it burned like poison ivy.  I LOVED the absence menstrual periods_ but the side effects were intolerable. My husband has since had a vasectomy (may the gods bless him.),F,38,3  days,1/27/2007,Depo-provera

Not too terribly happy because I am now on my third week of spotting_ sometimes I will be light enough for a panty liner other times in need of a tampon_ worst of all its always a surprise causing me to be worried 24-7 about an accident. I didnt realize that it effected my sex drive until I was reading the other raters comments and realized that it has effected mine as well. Experienced pain at the injection site for 2 weeks both times so far.

My real problem is acne - I never had it in high school_ but for the past few years I've had it pretty bad on my BACK. I was never like this before...but I haven't been in a tank top in public for ages because of this! I just don't know if it's the Depo or not - anyone else experience this?

(I took Ortho-TriCyclen for 2.5 years prior to starting the shot_ but stopped because my periods were insanely heavy_ and I developed a 4 inch. Ovarian cyst_ then got pregnant on Tri-Cyclen and miscarried...) I knew I had to try some new form of birth control_ one that actually worked & agreed with me more. I have extreme vaginal dryness since I have started depo_ which leads to painful intercourse. I have also become sensitive to Latex condoms. (Resolved that with lubricating gel and polyurethane condoms. If your wondering why we still use condoms even though I get Depo is because once a birthcontrol fails you_ you start getting a little more cautious... I was on Tricyclen for over 2 years before getting pregnant...) Last_ not least is Weight gain_ I have gained about 30 pounds the past year_ but I feel it's in part to other problems I have with work and getting my bachelors.

I actually lost more than my baby weight in the first 3 months. I didn't have headaches or back pain. The only problem I noticed was a calcium deficiency which I already suffered from. It just made it a little bit worse. But I have always taken medicine for that. After I decided to take a break from it and let my period run its course for a while it actually took about 10mnths before I had my first period. Then they were a little abnormal. Not bad though. Still no cramps with my periods. I just recently decided to get back on the shot. I have a little breast tenderness that I didnt have the first time. But not too bad. I have actually gained about 3lbs. But its probably needed since I only way about 120lbs anyway.I will say that the shot affects everyone differently.

I had NEVER had one before_ and she gave me the shot without examining me. Then she told me there were no side effects_ just that it may cause bone thinning_ and it will take 1 week to take effect. Within hours of getting the shot_ my emotions were severely effected in a negative way_ my body felt heavy_ I was tired_ and very hungry. The physical side effects wore off in a few days_ but the emotional problems worsened. I was very angry_ depressed_ suicidal_ anxious_ and constantly on edge. After about a month and a half on the shot_ I got a 3 week long period_ and had deep brown discharge everyday for a month and a half after that. I didn't want sex at all_ and even when I did sex was VERY painful throughout the three months on the shot.

After battling endo for upwards of 22 years_ the disappearance of pain has been an unbelievable experience.  However_ I am becoming increasingly torn over the continued use of Depo because of my seemingly escalating array of side effects.  I have gained 15 pounds in a year_ I seem tired all the time_ and sex with my husband of 20 years is so painful that I am avoiding it at all costs...very unhealthy for my marriage.  I have 5-year old twins and a 3 year old so I can attribute some of my irritability to the general turmoil of dealing with a houseful of small children but I really feel that I am unrationally volatile in a way that I hadn't been before.  I'm having serious doubts about my miracle benefits when balanced against my seeming costs.  My pain treatment against my mental well-being and the effects on my family!

I have been on it for two years now and was due for another shot in November_ which I did not get.  Now my breast are tender and swollen.  I took a pregnancy test and it was negative.

I do not have any bleeding with it which is one up side_ the other up side is contraceptive.  I'm convinced it's the depo which makes me feel depressed_ angry and irrational_ I wasn't like this before and I have no circumstances for feeling that way.  I find I feel happier about 10 to 12 weeks after the injection and am seriously thinking of coming off it_ and to hell if I get pregnant (although my boyfriend will not be pleased).

I've spent a fortune in scrubs_ lotions_ kits_ stringents_ soaps_ and everything else imaginable to clear up my skin without much luck. Also_ Before depo I was a very (some would say overly) sexually active person and since taking it I've had almost no interest in sex. I haven't had any weight gain_ but before starting Depo I was actively trying to lose and had lost 20lbs. I hoped if I just stepped up my weight loss routine the depo wouldn't effect it too much_  but no such luck. I went from losing 2-3 pounds a week_ to gaining and losing the same 3 pounds for 3 months.

1865, 1, BC while i was nursing,MAJOR weight gain_ loss of sex drive,I started the shot 2 months after I gave birth to my son.  It was the only hormonal BC that is safe while nursing an infant.  When I started the shot I was back to my normal weight_ 120lbs(at 5'2 tall).  After the first shot I noticed a slight but steady incline in my weight_ then all of the sudden_ almost over night I seemed to gain 25+ lbs.  I know this isn't due to poor diet or lack of exercise.  My husband and I are very active at the gym and eat very well.Recently I went to a new general practiner(we moved to another area) who seemed certain the weight gain was from the shot.  He told me I didn't have a lot of body fat and that it was water weight that should come off once the shot wore off.  My last shot was due over a month ago and needless to say_ I didn't get it.  Now I'm just waiting for my period to restart.  My doctor told me once I get my period that's a sign the depo is out of my system.

I had big problems with my period and it solved that. I too had the side effects and extensive testing to figure out what was wrong...and was told it wasn't the Depo. I weighed 94 lbs starting...went to 130 over the 7 years...thought it was age...stopped it and lost 30 lbs in 3 months! I feel better_ but went right back to period problems. My 37 year old brother had a massive stroke a few months ago...so now they don't want  me on anything. While I feel so much better off of it...I would have stayed on it if I didn't have that risk_ as long as I knew what was causing my horrible problems...and now just happy to know I don't have MS! Some tests indicated I did...so there is medical proof of the changes it causes to your body.

If it really does this to you_ it can effect your relationships and your emotional well being. The other side effects are all individualized as you can see in here. I have noticed in my situation that the longer I was on it the worse they became. My first two years were great. Years 3-6 everything seemed to occur.

I did suffer from depression before taking it_ and took the antidepressant Lexapro_ which controlled my depressive symptoms quite well.  Even though I continued to take Lexapro while on Depo_ the depression came back worse than ever.  One day I walked into the bathroom and swallowed every pill in the medicine cabinet and woke up three days later in the ICU.  I am CERTAIN this never would have happened without the Depo.

1885, 3, Birth control,i was thinking about getting off the shot since the next one is due in about 10 days! i am curious about what other people have to say about it! i think it's great that i haven't had a period in 4 years but really how good can that be for your body? either way_ about 3 months ago i was diagnosed with severe depression. I take my happy pills every day and they dont seem to be doing anything! after reading ALL of these posts i have come to realize that maybe my depression and everything that goes along with it could possibly be caused by depo! Oh the poor people around me that have to deal with this on a daily basis!!! I am looking for advice so please contact me via email if you have anything that might help...the good and the bad! thank you,,F,23,4  years,10/24/2006Email,Depo-provera

1887, 5, I was having unprotected sex early,The only thing I experienced with DEPO was an extreme weight gain. Within the first year I went up exactly 4 dress sizes. I was a comfortable 12 and by the time x-mas came around I was an unnoticeable size 16 because of my athletic build and nature. Track really paid off that first year.,I would recommend DEPO to any and everyone seeking comfort in not having a menstrual. I took the shot 4 times a year which averaged out to every three months for 6 years and I have no regrets. Now that I am off the drug I am not able to manage my weight because I indulged in bad eating habits for 6 years and now it is hard for me to get back to eating healthy and staying healthy.,F,21,6  years,10/18/2006,Depo-provera

My last one was about three weeks ago.  My family doctor put me on Zoloft and Synthroid (for a new thyroid problem) but I believe both problems are linked to the Depo shot.  I have a friend who gets the shot because of migranes and she loves it.  My doctors should have spent more time discussing the side effects with me.

The side effects didnt start happening until about a year of taking it. I didnt gain any weight at all though_ which i found surprising.

I call a bluff_ my appetite has actually gotten smaller and I've been gaining tons of weight. I haven't even been able to attempt to have sexual intercourse because i refuse to do so while bleeding.

Just put 5 to get to top of list.,I have been taking Depo provera for years_ and came on this website from looking for when my periods would return_ and now find out alot of health problems that I thought had come from nowhere_ seem to be from Depo Provera. I do not take any other medication_ and have no other reason to feel ill. I'm going to look more into this_ and think twice before having any more injections. The weight gain has been getting worse with each injection_ going from 10 stone to 13 stone! It seems to take some time of repeated use before the side effects really fully seem to take over your body. Sure it was originally a good thing to avoid unwanted pregnancy - but at loss of sexual feeling? or putting on so much weight that you might not attract a partner -as you look already pregnant? When I first took it I had a feeling of the body being clogged up with the hormone. I used to try to have a break inbetween before the next injection.

Weight easy to loose though.,I have been using the Depo for nearly 13 years now with really no side effects.  In fact it was such a relief to finally get rid of my 3 week long peiords.  However_ having read some other reviews I am questionning whether the way I feel_ i.e. sometimes very tired and moody is down to the injection?  Loss of sex drive is a major factor but more recently I have expereinced very sore and swollen breats and abdomen.

I am planning on going off of it soon because of the bone density scare and the regulate my system_ but my doctor swears that is a myth and is encouraging me to stay on the shot (she is a university Dr. and deals with brithcontrol questions as most of her day).

I am even more amazed that doctors refuse to tell patients about the dangers of this drug. How can they sleep at night knowing they're ruining young womens' lives.  I really want to have children some day and I'm terrified that I'm going to be permanently infertile.  It's also taken a toll on my 5-year relationship with my boyfriend (now fiance).  No matter what I do_ sex is always extremely painful now_ and it wasn't before I got on the shot.  The makers of this drug are total crooks. I was naive when I got on this and trusted my doctor to tell me of most of the dangers and so I didn't do any research before taking it.  I will never forgive myself for that.

Not having a period in almost a decade is NOT NORMAL. It's no wonder I'm going crazy. I have yet to even ask about potential bone density issues.

I have now been told by my doctor to never use hormone-based birth-control again.  This medication remained in my system for two years after my last injection.  What they don't tell you is that the dosage isn't adjusted to account for body mass_ and my (then) 102 lbs. frame couldn't handle medication guaranteed effective for someone twice my weight.

I became pregnant 6 months after discontinuing use and had a normal healthy pregnancy and healthy baby. I have recently started depo again because of the convenience (not having to remember bc pills) and also because not having a period and cramps is a lifesaver to me.

I am way too young for that!,It may look good on the surface_ but I'm kinda thinking it's evil. I should have figured that out. It's not natural for a woman to not have her period.

Severe chronic migraines (1-14 week) for over 6 months (spent a semester in a dark room in my bed).,It did help- stopped my painful periods.  Everything else was not worth what I had to go through to stop them though.  Now it has been well over eight months and I haven't gotten another period.  Could have masked early menopause.

1951, 1, birth control,continuous spotting/bleeding,"I started getting the shot because birth control pills gave me horrible mood swings.  My doctor told me that I may have some spotting until I got the second shot 3 months later_ and I did spot.  But after my second shot I continued having spotting.  For about a 2 or 3 month period of time the spotting stopped_ but started up again for another year.  My doctor kept telling me that it would stop and that it was normal to have spotting_ but I didn't think it was normal to be getting this ""almost period"" for almost 2 years.  It was gross because it was almost like ""old"" blood because it was not red_ it was more brown.  It's hard to be intimate with someone when you have brown liquid constantly coming out from ""down there"".  Once I stopped getting the shot it took a few months for my period to get back on track.

1954, 5, birth control,In last 3 years of treatment_ I did get a light period lasting about 3 weeks during most 3 mth segments - it only stopped when I got the shot again,First_ I would urge all women to consult their physician rather than these opinions in order to make their decision about birth control. That said_ it was really the perfect method for me and I have experienced no problems with this treatment_ I've in fact lost weight. Currently stopping treatment for a small break in order to maybe reset my system and hopefully get it back to its original effect once I start again (no period at all...). I'm a month past my last shot date_ which I skipped_ and my body feels pretty horrible_ with very tender breasts and frequent headaches. I'm also having bad acne again. Can't wait to go back on. But the key is to remember that any sharp hormonal change will have temporary upsetting effects on your body_ that should settle in time. So taking depo (or stopping it) requires an adjustment period and a bit of patience. I hope you all find a bc solution that meets your needs.,F,28,7  years,6/7/2006,Depo-provera

My friend mentioned the other day that it looked like I had lost some weight though I've started excercising and eating right so I don't think it has to do with the shot. Some spotting that I think will go away. Biggest thing is the acne...I never had acne before. Now I keep breaking out. It's driving me nuts!,I've liked not getting periods; my periods are usually pretty heavy. I haven't noticed any weight gain and I'm not particularly worried about it; if I gain weight then I'll just eat less and work out more to lose it. (Burn more calories than you eat=weight loss people_ it's not any more complicated than that). I don't like the zit problem. I used to have problems with dry skin_ and now it's oily all the time. This is the biggest drawback.I haven't noticed any problems with depression or anything like that_ but I've only been on it 3 months. The bone loss has me a bit concerned (even though I work out and take in more calicum). Between that and the oily skin_ I'm not sure if I want to stay on it or not. But not getting your period is nice! I'll have to think about it some more. I'll probably stay on the shot until I'm done with boot camp so I don't have to worry about periods and stuff.

Before I started the shot I was a healthy normal teenage girl.  While on the shot I was diagnosed with OCD_ Irritated Bowel Syndome_ and depression.  I started reading about it and realized that I didn't want to put my body in any more jeopardy and decided not to get it anymore.  I've been off it for 4 months now_ and it's been the hardest time of my life.  I have been on my period now for 3 months_ extreme acne_ ive been very depressed and ive been to 4 doctors and none of them know what to do for me.  I didnt gain any weight while on the shot but I'm sure it effects everyone differently.  To get on this page and read the rude remarks that ""women"" are making about us all being liars makes me wanna cry.

Now I am in love with a wonderful man and since he knew me before I started taking the shot again_ he's always saying how it changed me.

I still get spotting during the time that I am supposed to have my period but that goes away with another dose. as far as some women are concerned letes look at body mass as an example. the dose is the same for all women big or small. I think that perhaps alot of the problems that are associated with depo have to do with how much u weigh. it really makes perfect sense. ur body can react differently to the amount of alcohol intake with reagrd to size correct? so why isn't the same with a drug such as depo. 1ml for every womon would be,F,25,7.5  years,4/5/2006Email,Depo-provera

Not eating right and not excercising for years did that. It will not give you toe fungus or any of the other crazy ""side effects"" that some of the woman have listed. Depo has been wonderful to me. Its a long term way for my husband and I to not get pregnant. No side effects_ no weight gain_ no crazy unrelated horror stories at all. VERY FEW people have ill reactions to this and other medications. For most of us this is a great birth control that you only have to think about 4 times a year.

I also wanted birth control to work right away but the essures take a few months to grow the scar tissue that causes the blockage. So the DP shot should wear off right when the essures are working. (I get a sono then to see if the tubes are blocked). My doc assured me that one shot would probably not be a problem and so far I have no headaches_ no mood swings_ and I feel fine otherwise.

Started seeing a massage therapist because of ongoing back muscle problems_ and the pain starting moving down into my leg muscles lately.

I quit ovulating all together. At first_ I thought it was neat to not have periods. Now I think it's a little distrubing what the drug does to your body. I was initially placed on the shot because oral contreceptives had a tendency to increase my blood pressure. Depo did not increase my blood pressure_ but there are so many other things that started to go wrong over time. My physician paid little to no attention to all my weight gain and continued me on the drug for 4 years. She brushed my side effect off and said it was't caused from the shot. I changed drugs_ and doctors.,F,24,4  years,3/19/2006,Depo-provera

But_ I am tired of the negative side affects_ particularly the weight gain and the lack of sex drive_ which I see is very common.  I was miserable with pain every time I had a period before_ and during ovulation.  So_ for me it has been a good thing for the symptoms I went in for_ but I think it's probably not a drug you want to be on forever.  If the endometriosis returns_ I may opt for a complete hysterectomy_ and while i am hopeful I won't have to go this route_ it is no fun being in pain.  I have had my children already_ so fertility is not an issue for us.  But_ I can see where women would be very concerned about the long term effects of this drug.

When I started this drug_ my periods stopped along with all the cramping. I've been on it six years now_ and only recently have had my endometriosis symptons reoccur. I have not experienced any bone loss from the drug. The important thing to remember when starting this drug is to increase your calcium intake and exercise regularly to offset the bone loss issue. I will be switching to Lupron temporarily while being treated for endometriosis_ but will definitely be going back on Depo as soon as treatment is finished even though I am having my tubes tied.

I am about to switch to the pill again because of the bone loss and 2 year limit associated with that.  BUT I loved the shot!  It is one of the most effective forms of birth control!  Also_ previous to the shot I had have excessive bleeding and cramps that would make me throw-up; all of which the shot took away (the no period is the BEST part)!  I did have depression on the shot_ but that started BEFORE the shot_ and has ENDED while on the shot.  I did gain weight on the shot_ HOWEVER_ I've also lost up to 20lbs while on the shot! It's simple-- to gain thirty lbs_ you have to eat the food! I have experienced headaches and back pain_ ALL of which I experienced BEFORE the shot as well! And I did experience a slight decrease in my sex drive_ but the man in your life can fix that (I definitely still have desire)!

With the weight it has filled me out in places that needed filling out_ so my body looks better (except for a little pudge in the stomach). Another good thing is that I don't feel like I have to worry every time my husband and I have sex_ which is a plus for both of us since we are not ready to have children yet. But on the down-side_ it doesn't do anything for my irregular menstrual cycles_ I feel depressed more often and that depression seems intense and I feel that my anxiety has intensified while being on this drug.

2015, 5, birth control and no period,Weight gain about 30lbs in 2 years_ a little moody_ spotting for the first nine months or more. now no period very happy,I have been on depo for about 2 years_ when i first started i spotted none stop for about nine months straight. but it was only like a pantiliner need no heavier. i've always had a problem with my weight and i don't exercise so it could be because of that that i have gained weight and not the depo. i usually gain a pound every three months. breast are tender but that just happened recently. other then that it is doing what i wanted no period and no pregnancy. will continue to us the product until i am married and ready to have children.,F,24,2  years,12/11/2005Email,Depo-provera
2016, 1, birth control,Complete loss of sex drive_ and lubrication. Painfull sex to the point of almost crying at times. headaches_ weight gain only about 5 pounds tho. Hair loss that made me very self concious and afraid to style my hair for fear of loosing more. i bled for 4 months straight after i had just stopped bleeding from having my daughter,im glad i switched to ovcon ive only been on it a few days but my headaches have subsided and hopefully my sex drive will come back_ my husband is not to happy with the depo shot either. i have to say i wouldnt tell anyone to take the shot. it may be nice to not get ur period but honestly_ id prefer to have painless sex and no hair loss with my period than to have no period and in pain and constant wonder if im pregnant.,F,19,5  months,12/9/2005,Depo-provera
2017, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,I started taking Depo in June and my period never stopped. I asked my doctor about it and she said I would be fine and recommended I get another shot_ which I did. This was in August. It is now December and I am still bleeding. I would never recommend anyone to get on Depo.

My anxiety attacks have gotten so bad_ I can barely function.  Talking with friends and thinking back_ it seemed to start when the Depot shots started.  Researching if anxiety is a known side effect_ I find all of these others things I have been going through are also known side effects!  At my Annual a couple of months ago_ I asked my OBGyn if my bowel troubles could be a side effect and she said to talk to my GP about IBS!  Needless to say_ I will not ever get anbother shot of this.  I think I would rather live with Endo pain and bleeding.  At least I could think straight.  Should I wait for a period of time before I return to the patch?,F,37,1  years,12/5/2005Email,Depo-provera
2019, 5, to avoid pregnancy.,no periods_ vaginal dryness_ low sex drive_ slight weight increase.,I had vaginal dryness and low sex drive for the first couple of months but this has sorted itself out and im back to normal.  i have had slight weight gain_ about 4lbs_ but it isn't noticable in my mesurements so it could be water retention as im not eating anymore than i normally do.  if my wieght continues to increase i might think of using a different contraception as it took a year of dieting to lose 25lbs. Apart from this the drug is great for me.,F,25,6  months,12/1/2005,Depo-provera

Howevever_ now 9months since last injection_ my husband and i are trying to start a family_ I still havent had a period_ but have had all the cramps. Also i have had hot flashes and achy bones i have found myself very lazy as well. Although these side effects have only recently appeared so it shows how long depo stays in your body. I just wish i could rid it from my system and get my periods back. Feel very depressed at times.,F,29,21  months,11/28/2005,Depo-provera
2022, 5, Heavy periods,None.,Before I took Depo Provera I was on the birth control pill.  The pill caused blood clots which almost caused my death...thankfully I was saved in time.  My reason for being on Depo Provera (and prior to that_ the pill) was/is for extremely heavy periods - ones lasting months at a time and causing me to be weak.  Also_ months of periods over the years ruined many of my clothes...I have not experienced any negative side effects.  I haven't gained any weight_ and I haven't lost any hair.  Maybe I am a lucky one_ but I can't say anything bad about the shot.,F,27,5  years,11/27/2005,Depo-provera

2029, 5, Endo treatment,The first time I was on the medication I had none!  This time I have had a lot.  I started Depo when I was 18 for birth control...I stopped taking it for about 2 years and it took a long time for my period to return...but when it did I found that I have multiple cysts on both ovaries.  I then found out that all of my pain and a lot of mood swings were due to a condition called endometriosis.  It causes sever pain_ mood swings_ heavy periods_   I was treated for it by being injected with the shot once a month for 6 months (it was a fake pregnancy)  This was very hard for me...you have all of the hormones of a 9 month pregnancy lady and no baby to look forward to.  Since then I have continued on the depo shot in a regular fashion.  I am currently experiencing weight gain and moodiness towards the end of the shot.  I know that it has made me a functional person again and I am thankful.,I read all of these testimonials and see that many women are experiencing symptoms of endometriosis.  Depo does not work for everyone and weight gain or worse symptoms can come at the 2-3 year mark.  But symptoms can get worse...if you are depressed...it is b/c of the hormones.  An anti-depressant can help ease the side effect.  I do get hot-flashes and the weight gain is getting to be too much_ so I will be trying to explore other options.  But all of this is better than the extreme pain I was experiencing due to my period or just releasing an egg.  Do not ignore the symptoms until they are horrible.  Also do not let Depo be your first Birth Control ever....some people cannot handle the hormone progesterone that is why there are a lot of different BC's...you should first try a progesterone based BC before trying Depo...b/c Depo is not something you can stop taking after one mth....you are stuck with it for three mths. Make sure you are not just another face to your doctor.  I was give,F,24,3  years,10/31/2005Email,Depo-provera
2030, 1, Very Painful Periods/Endometriosis,"I gained over 50lbs on Depo-Provera.  I also gained a low sex-drive_ unwanted body hair_ and cyst-like acne.  My vaginal lubrication went down to nill_ and I bled non-stop for the first three months. I became depressed in a very apathetic way_ and suffered from heart palpitations.  It works by tricking your body into thinking it's pregnant. It doesn't do well to be ""pregnant"" for two strait years...","After going off depo_ my periods didn't start again until over a year later.  I've only had two ""normal"" periods so far where they're 5-7 days long and 28 days apart. I'm hoping for a third. Some of the weight is gone_ but only about half of it.  The body hair still persists_ and the acne is just barely lessening.  My periods are more painful now than they were before_ and I'm getting painful cramps in odd parts of my cycle.  I get frisky now... Which is great.  Although_ the lubrication can still be an issue.  The apathy is gone_ thankfully_ and I've never felt so happy to be happy... or sad... or angry...

2033, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain_ nausea_ depression,I took my last shot 4 months ago. I was on it for almost 8 years. I thought / and I was told that side effects would go away after a few shots. I was fine the first few years but found I was getting weepy or hungry before the shot was due. I went off for a year and lost a lot of weight. I then got back on thinking that with diet and exercise I would be fine. I was wrong and gained about 1lb a month for the next 3 years.  Now that I am off I am experiencing what I can only assume is withdrawl. I have had nausea all day for almost a month_ my breasts are sore. I feel like I am stuck in first trimester pregnancy. I have noticed that even with all of this I am not depressed though. So in summary it was good for a while_ but I would not suggest for long term - also I would suggest people to really pay attention to how they feel when on the shot. The depression really snuck up on me.,F,26,7  years,10/23/2005,Depo-provera

When I first got on depo provera I lost my periods almost immediately and was EXCITED. I am a very petite girl so I was ok with the idea of gaining 5 to 10 lbs. This backfired_ because i LOST 14 lbs. everyone thought i was anorexic- my appetite diminished and I was no longer eating like i use to. This alerted my mother_ but i told her that everything else was fine and I didn't want my period. I stayed on it for 2 years and January of this year(2005) was my last shot.

However after 4.5 years of being on depo my mother insisted I get a bone density test and the results were bad. Basically I have the bones of a post-menopausal woman now. It has taken around 11 months from the time of the final shot to get a period again. I take 1600 mg of calcium daily and lift weights three times weekly. I will have another bone density test in Jan.

I had happily been on depo provera for many years and had done well. In january 2005 the doctor had switched me from name brand depo-provera to the generic brand. I started getting the symptoms I listed right after the shot in January.I asked my doctor if the way I was feeling was do to the change from name brand to generic he said no. Because I was on it for so many years there is no way that what I am experiencing has come on from the shot.I have been to the doctors and tested and I am as healthy according to blood/urine tests. I don't understand why I am having these symptoms.I got a few more opinions from a pharmacist and two nurses and have been told it is possible that what I am going through is from the shot. For numerous reasons e.g. body changes...Well it is now months later July 08_ 2005 in fact and I am due for the shot the end of this month. I am going to stop taking it and see if in a few months that these symptoms dissapear.Prior to all of this I had been healthy happy and in college and working overall I was doing well.,F,29,8  years,7/8/2005Email,Depo-provera

I used to love it but after reading the comments of several women and realizing all the sypmtoms i am having are probably caused by this im am appalled! This is awful stuff and it cant believe i even took it for so long. It is not good for relationships with signifigant others and really has affected my life ie: almost lost job due to increased reactions to stress and moodiness. Dont take this crap! Now begins the painful process of weaning myself off this drug_ if your considering_ dont ask a doctor for the side affects and risks_ look at the real commentary_ the stuff they dont tell you about at the doctors office.

2068, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain (14lb)_ Agression_ Painful breasts_ Racing pulse_ loss of sex drive and dryness.,The first time I took it I had no side effects appart from no period which at the time I thought was great. I took it for about a year and stopped when I split from my boyfriend. My periods returned after about 3 months. A year later I started having the shots again and recieved 5 before i decided that the weight gain was intolerable and had lost my sex drive anyway so saw no point in continuing. My real problems started then. It took just over a year for my periods to return and they have been irregular ever since. My breasts are continuously swolen and painful and I am finding it impossible to lose the weight I gained. I am worried about the long term effects now that I am aware they haven't really a clue about the likns with cancer and ostoperosis. i wasn't given enough infomation before I was given it. I hope also that it won't effect my chances of concieving. Slowly with healthy eating and so on the side effects are wearing off but I regret not being properly informed before I took it. The idea of not having a period is so appealing when you are a carefree adolescent you doin't think about the possible conciquences. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,F,26,15  months,7/7/2005Email,Depo-provera

I would not reccomend it to anyone else because I have had such a downpour of medical effects on my body sense I have started taking it. The depo provera shot has made me almost unapproachable to my husband and family because of depression and headaches that could kill have made me very irritable. Intamacy is a must in a marriage and in mine it has been gone sense my second shot. It made me not feel attractive or turned on. My face has stayed broken out sense taking my first shot and the irregular bleeding has been aggravating because just when I thought I had stopped I started again at very inconvenient times and with unpredictability it has interfered with my perosnal and with my professional standing.

My PMS is gone completely. No joint pain_ no muscle pain_ no bloating or tender breasts_ no pain during sex_ no loss of natural lubrication. No self-diagnosed maladies that I can blame on Depo-Provera in order to push my rabid anti-birth control agenda. The only side effect I have is that I have not experienced amennoreah as most women do. After my shots_ I have no period for 4 weeks_ then I spot or bleed with varying intensity for two months. I have taken iron supplements_ but it's had no effect on the bleeding (it is keeping me from being anemic.) I'm not sure if I will continue with this for a third shot or not. I'm thinking about trying it for a year_ to see if my periods do stop altogether_ but I want to discuss it with my GYN to find out if my experience is rare or warrants medical action.,F,36,6  months,5/19/2005,Depo-provera

I would go to the gym 5 times a week for 2-3 hrs per day_ walk an hour extra at home and be on a strict diet and couldn't loss the weight. My poor hubby would touch me and i'd be thinking in my head of god not again. I should of brought shares in ky jelly cause we had to use that all the time. It had nearly wrecked my marriage because of the no sex even though my hubby loves me and supports me it has come close. It is an EVIL drug and not worth the time or the money.

I am starting on my second shot and hoping it gets better as my body gets used to it. I haven't had weight gain or increase in appetite. The first 3 months was ok with small side effects.. I had dark spotting_ then light bleeding for about 3 weeks_ that sucked but it just stopped over night and I haven't had it since. I am  having minor headaches and a little nausea but it has helped my acne and I don't have the worry of getting pregnant.

Before the shot I enjoyed having sex (although I was WAY TOO YOUNG) I still enjoyed it. I don't remember the last time I really could do it without problems. It is very painful when I do want it_ and for the most part I complain to my boyfriend when he touches me because I am not into it. (And it is not HIS fault) I've had bouts with depression since 2002 (6 months after I began depo) and severe anxiety in the past 2 years. I have SEVERE back ache and pain in my joints. I dont know if this is to do with the shot but recently I've been thinking so. It started after I began the shot. I have a total lack of confidence due to my decreased sex drive. The shot has made me feel unfeminine and totally not sexy. I feel like a failure in the sex department. The only reason I give it a 3 is because I have had no babies and no period.,F,20,4  years,5/10/2005,Depo-provera

I immediately showed signs of weight gain (which was difficult because I've always been thin).  By the 3rd month_ I had facial_ neck_ and back acne so bad that I would lose count how many were showing at one time on my face (before the shot_ I would average around 5 pimples a year! -- now I have around 20-25 pimples on my face alone every day!).  By the end of the first month_ I would have to pee so often that I have yet to go a night without having to wake up and go to the bathroom (never had to pee in the middle of the night before the shot).  But what finally made me get off the shot??  The joint pain.  The worst is in my leg-hip joints_ full back and shoulders.  The pain would be so bad early in the morning while still in bed_ that I would have to get up out of bed (even if at 5AM) to ease the pain.  The pain would be so bad_ that it hurt to walk_ and I would walk like an 80 yr old throughout my workplace -- it was soooo embarrassing!,F,33,9  months,5/6/2005Email,Depo-provera
2099, 2, Alternative to taking a daily pill.,Fatigue_ sore muscles_ dizziness_ back and neck pain_ mood swings_ continuous spotting_ nervous anxieties_ and bloating.,I used to take depo provera about 2 years ago for about a year. I stopped it for more than a year and recently started taking it 6 months ago. I haven't been feeling like myself lately. I actually didn't realize it_ till I noticed myself getting sentimental way too often_ and I'm not that type usually. I started to realize all the other changes or irregularities I've been experiencing lately_ so I decided to look up information about Depo Provera. Probably explains why my jeans fit a little bit tighter too... My next shot is due this month and I decided to stop it. I'm going to try the whole detox ordeal since it the medication stays in your body for about half a year. I used to be a very ernegetic person who couldn't stand being home... lately I've been running to my bed to get at least a little rest every day_ not to mention the amount of money I've spent on Redbulls for energy. It's the best thing not to worry or deal with taking a pill daily. Too good to be true in some cases. Probably better to deal with pills in the long run.,F,22,6  months,5/6/2005,Depo-provera

I have gained 20 pounds_ my hair is alittle more oily_ acne (More so on butt and back. And it seems that my energy has decreased. My sex drive is still the same maybe even increased alittle.,Depo is the best choice for smokers_ since it does not contain estrogene which can make cancer occur easily. It is also nice because it's supposed to be more effective than the pill_ and you only hafta get it every 3 months. But_ I have been bleeding like crazy lately_ mostly when I'm stressed_ lifting anything_ or am sexually active (including both intercourse and non-intercourse).,F,17,2  years,5/5/2005,Depo-provera
2101, 1, Birth Control,It transformed my life; I lost perspective and self esteem. I had a huge depression with an incredible lack of energy. My sex drive decreased 100%_ headaches_ depression_ continuous bleeding_ cramps_ and bloating.,One single shot was enough to damage my life and my body. I got the shot in November 2004 and after 20 days I started experiencing painful cramps and my period heavily arrived. It is May 2005 and there hasn¬ít been a day without this annoying bleeding. I wake up every day expecting that the bleeding is gone. The symptoms have been irregular over this six-month period. The only two symptoms that have been stuck with me since I got the shot are a heavy bleeding and a non-existing sex drive. In the second month I was hit by migraines something that I never experienced before. The shot provided me with horrendous acne and skin problems over my third month. The fourth month was the worst_ I fell into an incredible depression where I just wanted to disappear and no longer live this life.  There it was when I started seeing a psychologist and a naturopath. The naturopath couldn¬ít believe any of that and immediately prescribed an iron supplement since my iron level has dropped drastically. Yesterday I went to see a specialist (gynecologist) who says to me ¬ìOH! Everything is totally normal.

2102, 3, contraception,weight gain incl. increase breast cup_ spotting/bleeding_ minimal cramps_ pimples & oilier skin_ feeling hot & sweatier than usual due to added weight_ possibly vaginal dryness.,I experienced some life changes at the same time I started depo. I didn't have a period until 3 weeks ago. I started spotting & light bleeding for the last 3 weeks off & on. was concerned but saw here that it's normal. I was on ortho tricyclin for 10 years but had high blood pressure and couldn't continue it. I gained about 10-20 during the time i was on pills. I have gained abou 30 lbs. since being on depo. it makes me uncomfortable but it's not that big a deal. I was more concerned about the bleeding. I would get a tubal ligation but have no insurance and can't afford one. The idea of no periods is appealing_ I hope the spotting & bleeding stop. I was angry that they didn't tell me that depo causes you to feel hungry which explains the weight gain. I also was not aware until my 2nd shot that it causes calcium leaching. I was advised to take_ B-12 ( i believe) to help curb the feeling of hunger. I was advised to take 1_000mg of calcium a day to prevent calcium leaching.  i have had some blemishes but not enough to distress me. i have been using better face cleaning stuff.  I have been feeling hot and sweaty easier than usual but i attribute that to the extra weight i am not used to bearing. I may be experiencing the vaginal dryness or it could be the fact that I am older and having sex more w/ lubricated condoms. i know that will effect moisture production.I am hoping that my side effects stay mild and go away. i have friends who have had mixed results in this. it's always risky to take any kind of medication on a daily long term basis. there will always be possible side effects and you have to decide if they are more bearable that the consequences of not taking them.,F,30,6  months,5/1/2005Email,Depo-provera
2103, 2, To prevent periods,Weight Gain_ Loss of Libido_ No Periods,I have gained 30 pounds since starting Depo 5 years ago. I have experienced a tiredness and weakness since starting Depo_ but I also started a blood pressure medication at the same time so I can't be sure which_ if either_ are to blame. My last injection was 9 months ago_ and I haven't started a period yet. I am still having a struggle loosing weight_ even with exercise. I have also had leg pain while exercising since starting Depo. I would really suggest another form of BC_ I am sure I have damaged my hormonal balance_ and hope it's not permanent.,F,33,4.5  years,4/30/2005Email,Depo-provera
2104, 1, Birth Control,loss of sex drive_ depression_ mood swings,I understand that some wome women have a great experience with depo. Mine has been a nightmare. I started having severe mood swings and I was depressed after my first shot. It would always get worse right after a shot. I loved not having a period though_ so I stayed on it. I have now been off for 16 months and trying to get pregnant for the past 8 with no success.It doesn't help at all that I have no desire to have sex. I have heard so many stories of women who were unable to get pregnant for 2 or three years after depo. If you are considering the shot_ make sure you understand the risks,F,23,16  months,4/29/2005,Depo-provera

2106, 2, To prevent pregnancy,Acne.  Weight gain.  Irregular vaginal bleeding.  Tendon/ligament pain.,I was on estrogen/progestin contraception off and on in my late teens and early twenties_ with few side-effects.  I recently had a child and my ob/gyn and I decided a progestin-only form of birth control was right for me because I am currently nursing.Within a couple of days of the shot_ I developed acne.  Not typical teenager_ oily-skin acne_ but the cystic_ deep-tissue variety.  No exfoliating or scrubbing can solve my problem.I began having my period almost constantly.  I would have a period for 7 days and then have a few days off_ and then it would start up again.I had tendon/ligament pain in some of my joints_ during pregnancy_ which I attributed to elevated estrogen/progesterone during pregnancy.  I assume the elevated progestin (synthetic progesterone of Depo) has a similar effect.I am breastfeeding exclusively_ which should allow a moderate weight loss (1-2 lbs/week) with a healthy diet (which I eat).  My weight hasn't budged since going on Depo 12 weeks post-partum.,F,28,9  weeks,4/26/2005,Depo-provera

2108, 3, Birth Control / Help with Migraines,Complete loss of sex drive_ complete loss of lubrication_ painful/very sore intercourse.... HENCE LOSS OF BOYFRIEND!!!!,I have been on Depo now for 5 years and never missed a shot. I haven't had a period since the day I started having it (which is great). I also haven't had ANY cramps or bad PMT!!!! One of the main reasons why I started having depo was because of the 3 day migraines I was having every 21st day of my cycle_ which would make me vomit and be uncapable of moving or speaking. Depo stopped my migraines from being so regular and I now have a migraine very rarely. The first side effect I noticed was the complete loss of my sex drive. I honestly can not remember_ in 5 years_ the last time I wanted sex.... When I am talked into it_ I really can't be bothered and normally find myself thinking about what I'm going to cook for my dinner. I have absolutely no lubrication of my own and then start to wish it was over because I'm getting so SORE!!!!! Which then turns into pain.... until I eventually have to stop!!!! This then puts me off even more the next time. My boyfriend eventually split up with me because he thought either I didn't fancy him any more_ or I was getting sex elsewhere because I didn't want to do it with him...... I have decided I am not going to have my next shot in May_ to see if my sex drive returns and to see if sex becomes pleasure instead of PAIN again. I just hope my painful periods and migraines don't return with avengence!!!! I'd love to hear from ladies that have experienced similar problems x x x,F,24,5  days,4/25/2005Email,Depo-provera

2110, 3, birth control,No period for first two years_ then a year break.  The second time I started depo_ I got nonstop bleeding for over three months_ which was disgusting and hard to explain to my boyfriend.  Why did I have my period from Christmas to April?  Good for some people_ but the effects can change.  Expect heavy bleeding and acne a couple weeks before you get each shot.,I would think twice before taking depo.  You may love it but you may get bad results.  I had totally different experiences only one year apart.,F,25,2.5  years,4/20/2005,Depo-provera

I feel like I'm 80 years old_ my body feels like I have arthiritis all over_ I can't sit_ stand or lay down for any length of time because of the pain_ No matter how little I eat and how many miles I walk_ I can't get rid of even one pound..

2115, 2, birth control,Weight gain_ headaches_ cramping,I would not recommend this form of birth control to anyone unless you had no other options.  I have gained 20 lbs since on the shot.  I also experienced the worse cramping I have ever had right before and after I was to receive the shot.  Although I loved not receiving my period_ I could not take the pain any longer.  I switched to Mircette which is able to be taken continuously so that I do not receive my experience.  However_ since taking this_ I have gained an additional 8 lbs with major mood swings. I have switched now to Levlite in hopes of less side effects.,F,25,6  months,4/11/2005,Depo-provera

2119, 4, Birth Control,Acne,The worst thing about this drug in my opinion is that I developed acne.  I've never had acne before and it has been awful!  I've finally got the situation under control thanks to a new regimine. I just recently started taking the shot again because I couldn't remember to take my birth control pills.  I was taking the shot for about a year the first time and had to stop taking it because I was sick of the acne and I lost so much weight.  I know a lot of people said they gained weight_ but I lost so much weight the first time around that I looked unhealty.  I was wondering if anyone else has heard of this.,F,22,3  months,4/6/2005Email,Depo-provera

I did not have a period for the year and a half that I was on depo but the weight gain and other side effects outwayed that one. I am currently on Ovcon 35 and am pleased with it so far.

If i could honestly go back to the day i bought the needle i would take it back. This needle can make you gain up to 50 pounds per so many needles_ and I know that the needle is the reason of my excessive weight gain. Definately ask all the quiestions before you get the doctor to give you this shot_ because it can change your life forever_ sometimes for the best and in my case for the worst!

2148, 5, contraception,weight gain_ bloated feeling_ food cravings,Since taking this shot 11 years ago_ I have had a very worry free life. Life with my heavy sickly periods was over once I started depo. I am active and like to travel_ so not having to worry about periods is grand. What is helpful with my relationship is that depo controls mood swings. You are able to stay more even - not get too mad_ sad_ or happy. It levels you. My husband likes the way that depo helps me to be easier to live with. I would recommend it. My husband and I have no plans to have children_ so it works for me.  I Don't think I'll come off it any time soon. I have taken calcium and other vitamins for  many years to combat the side affect of bone loss.

2151, 1, easier to remember than the pill.,I experienced every side effect known_ plus many more that my doctor had never seen from the shot! I gained huge amounts of weight_ terrible muscle and body aches_ extreme headaches_ no sex drive_ vomiting_ nausea_ severe stomach pain_ and many more! To top it all off_ I now have had to take other meds to get my period back! Still am not completely back to normal and it has been over a year!!!,Would not recommend it for anyone at any time!!,F,25,6  months,2/16/2005Email,Depo-provera
2152, 1, Birth Control,Severe acne_ Weight gain_ Anxiety and Panic Attacks_ Depression and Sleep Issues_ Breast soreness (Increase & Decrease in size)_ Severe mood swings including an increase in anger. Body aches_ back and legs and I now suddenly have allergies_ which I never had.,PLEASE READ ME!!!! DEPO ALMOST RUINED MY RELATIONSHIP!!!I  started taking this drug when I was 21 and started off having no problems. My period stopped within 6 months and I have not had one for 5 years_ except for occational spotting near the time of the shot. However_ the past 6 months have been HORRIBLE!  My face broke out with acne 3 shots ago. I have never had acne and at 27_ found it shocking. after spending hundreds of dollars on products and facials_ I went to a dermatologist and cosmetologist- they both said it was the birthcontrol. The Acne was the least of my problems- The SEVERE MOOD SWINGS  have been unbearable! I have never had mental or psychological issues. On Depo I burst out crying- am depressed most of the time (and I'm normally a very happy_ energetic_ outgoing young woman)_ I have outbursts of anger and I feel tired ALL the time.  I have always had confidence and now I have never felt so bad nor looked so bad. My last shot was 3 weeks ago- and my arm still hurts where I was injected! I truly hope someday I will be back to normal- this has put such a strain on my relationship- I'm lucky to have a man that recognizes that this is NOT the real me_ but the hormones that have taken over my body. IF THERE IS ANYONE THAT KNOWS OF A GOOD ALTERNATIVE BIRTH CONTROL OR A WAY TO HELP MY SYMPTOMS_ PLEASE ADVISE...To everyone else_ I wish you well! Please Don't let this happen to you!,F,27,5  years,2/16/2005Email,Depo-provera

2155, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,I was on the depo provera shot  for three years.  I have to admit that while i was on it i loved it_ i didnt have my period the entire time and experienced some weight loss.  I got off of the shot a little under a year ago and have been experiencing terrible side effects ever since.  I have gained 30 pounds_ heavier periods_  and severe cramping.  The weight has made me very depressed and just wont seem to go away.,,F,18,3  years,2/15/2005Email,Depo-provera
2156, 3, Safer for breastfeeding moms?,Weight gain_ Extremely low libido_ amenorrea (this one I don't mind). I also notice that my appetite has increased and if I don't eat frequently during the day I get dizzy and moody_ sometimes I shake. I do blame the weight gain on Depo Provera_since my eating habits have not change_ but somehow my metabolism has.,This is the second time I am on Depo Provera and the first time I experienced heavy bleeding and cramping once I stop using it_ I am afraid it will happen again.It is a shame that is not covered by most health insurance.,F,30,10  months,2/14/2005,Depo-provera
2157, 2, Birth Control,hair loss_ joint pain_ breast tenderness_ moodiness,The first time I took it I was on it for about a year.  I didn't notice any side effects.  My period stopped all together which was great and my moods seemed good most of the time.  I stopped when I started getting extreme soreness in my breasts near my arm-pits.  I stayed off it for about another year_ during which time I felt like I was a crazy person.  Extreme anxiety.  I finally decided to go back on it about four months ago.  I just decided tonight that I'm not going to get my next shot.  I was running my hand through my hair and a chunk of hair came out.  I've been noticing a lot of hair loss when combing my hair_ but didn't put it together that it was the shot causing it.  It's been going on for about 2-3 months now_ since I started back on the shot.  About two weeks ago I also started having pain in my right hip.  I can't really explain the type of pain_ but it's off and on and feels like it's in the joint.  There are the good sides to the shot_ but for me_ I just don't think it is healthy and I would not recommend it.  It seems there are more people having problems than not.  I believe that those who are rating it a 5 are either not aware of what it's doing to them or they just haven't used it long enough to experience the effects.,F,25,4  months,2/13/2005,Depo-provera
2158, 2, Birth Control and no periods!,Weight gain. A stone and a half so far (25 pounds)_ which is a lot on my 4' 11,Good points - I haven't had a period or got pregnant! I have now gone back to the Family PLanning clinic and will be back on the pill next month (when my next Depo is due)_ the weight gain is not funny - I've gone up almost 3 dress sizes now (depending on the shop!) and I look 'fat'. The weight has gone on around my middle and hips - the danger area. Before Depo_ I was an hourglass_ and the weight would go on evenly.I was told by the nurse that I was lucky I hadn't put on any more weight - a few more pounds and I wouldn't have been able to go back on the combined pill due to higher risk of DVT. I would only recommend this if NOTHING else worked.,F,31,18  months,2/12/2005Email,Depo-provera

I only took it for 3 months and I will never take it again or recommend it to anyone. The shot is now out of my system and I've had pregnancy like symptoms for 2 weeks. My boobs swelled 1/2x their normal size and hurt like hell. I feel sick all day. I took a preg. test and it turned up negative. This shot is not worth it.

I am not happy about the weight gain(about 30lbs) but I was very thin before I started the shot and I needed to gain weight but it is still a shock every time I get on the scales.

Four wonderful years without a period_ but four years to gain 45 pounds.  I am doing nothing different as far as my diet and/or activities_ but since being on depo_ I am 4 pants sizes larger and 45 pounds heavier.  I love the convenience of this pill and the fact that I haven't had a period_ but it isn't worth the side effects; most of all_ the weight gain.  I used to be a small 109 pounds in a size 2/3.  Oh how I would love to see those days again.  That is why I have finally decided to get off depo_ and I will never_ ever_ ever use it again.,F,23,4  years,2/8/2005,Depo-provera
2169, 1, to prevent pregnancy,I have had horrible weight gain_ zits_ hair loss_ bone loss_ mood swings_ depression and anxioty.,My mom died of overian cancer_ 3 doctors told me to go on depo to prevent pregnancy after my 2nd miscarriage.  When I started to gain weight it wasn't an issue with my doctor_ I went to a different doctor and still wasn't an issue I was told to stay on it since it would lower my risk of overian cancer. When I broke my wrist after loosing my mind one night I was told I had very bad bone loss that they normally don't see that till your 60's and at that time I was 27_ I went to a different doctor and was told there was no bone loss. I have suffered from major anxioty attacks that seemed to go away if I ate_ which I suffered from the last 6-7 years_ my doctor told me low blood sugar till I had a glucose test that was normal_ I figured anxioty and the pills he gave helped so I guess I was right. I have over the last 12 months gained 30 pounds_ still no concern to my doctor_ now I weight almost 300 and I am only 5'4_ I tried to loose weight with diet and exersise and I again gained. I can only figure it is the depo shot_ I asked my doctor and he said everybody's bodies are different but it would be a step in the right direction to get off the shot. I have actually gained roughly 160 pounds in the 8 years on the shot and not yet sure what else is wrong with me.,F,30,8  years,2/7/2005,Depo-provera

2174, 4, Birth Control & stop painful period,Almost no side-effects until I switched physicians.  The new Doctor increased the frequency in which I got the shot by one to two weeks.  I had been on the shot for 5 years with no problems and after a year on the new increased schedual I began getting severe hot flashes and insomnia.  Emmotionally I felt crazy and it affected my work and relationships.  I consulted a reproductive endocrinologist that believes after long term use it is a good idea to reduce the frequency in which one gets the shot.  She said that the increase in frequency of the shot had put me into a drug induced menapause.  She had me go off the shot and 6 months later my estrogen is up enough to start my horribly painful periods again but still way to low to go back on any sort of birthcontrol.  She is afraid any BC would set me right back into menapause.  Having my periods again is almost as frustrating as the severe symptoms of menapause.  It has been a year since my last shot and I still am not normal.  I still get hot flashes and insomnia just not as bad and I hate my abnormal_ heavy_ and painful periods.  I miss my shot and wish I had had a physician who was smart enough to decrease instead of increase the frequency in which I would get the shot.,Maybe after several years of using the shot Doctors should test patients for bone density and estogen levels.  They should reccomend from the begginning that patients take Calcium suppliments and if estrogen is too low decrease the frequency in which patients get the shot.,F,33,6  days,1/29/2005Email,Depo-provera

2177, 1, Birth Control,Weight Gain from the beginning_ loss of sex drive and dryness_tiredness_ terrible moodswings and depression_ possibly- joint pain_ memory loss and trouble with speaking (using the right words etc.)Breast soreness since stopping - 2 periods so far this month.,I was due for my last shot in September and did not go.  I never had a period while on the shots.  I got my period about 6 1/2 months after my last shot.  That was 2 weeks ago.  Now I am having another period - don't know how long it will last.  I was just checking on line to see if this was normal when stopping.  I am freaked out by all of the entries.  My doctor always reassured me my problems were not related to depo.  In fact he has stressed how much weight gain I have had and that I had to do something about it.  I told him every shot I got I gained 10 pounds that week and it would take the 3 months to get most of that off then it was time for the next shot. I gained about 50 pounds total in the nearly 5 years I was on it.  He said it was not becasue of the shot.  One time I even went to him (after I had been really dieting and lossing and the weight) and I had gained it all back.  He asked what the problem was and I said I got so depressed I just gave up and he never once mentioned that was a side effect.  I have been moody (to put it nicely) to my kids and my husband... I am lucky they are still here.  Of course I had no sex drive.. in fact I would pull away when my husband tried to touch me.  I was always dry and never initiated sex.  I thought that had changed after my second child instead of being caused by the medicine.5 months after my last shot -dryness was no longer a problem.  7 months after depo my attitude is better - I am much more patient and less stressed- I am not screaming.  Joints still hurt_ memory still sucks etc.  But the weight is beginning to come off.  10 pounds this month.  I also was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes on the depo.  Now sugar is well within the normal range without meds.  BAD STUFF!  No periods while on it but who knows when they will straighten out afterwords.

If you are on depo and are thinking about having a baby anytime in the next year get off of it now.  When I first got off of depo for the first 2 months you get all of the symptoms that you are pregnant. Morning sickness_ tender breasts_ all of that good stuff but believe me your not pregnant.  I was on another web site and the average time it takes you to even get a regular period is almost 2 years.  And it took most women that I talked to 3 or more years to get pregnant.

Being please with the first few months_ I went in for the second shot_ about two or so weeks after that_ everything went down hill. Basically_ my emotions were so whacked out that I thought that I was going crazy_ the emotions were either anger or depression_ constantly changing. The best part (sarcasm) was when I started my period and it didn't stop. I had my period for a year_ with maybe a day or two off from it a month (no joke!).

I had to do my own research and find out for myself.  Before you take this medicine ask yourself_ is it really worth the risk??

2187, 5, Birth-Control/Painful Periods,No Negative,I have been on Depo for almost 4 years and have had no period  or any serious problems.  In fact the drug seemed to control my mood swings and food cravings (probably due to the fact that I had no period).  I recently switched to the pill and often forget to take it and I have gained over 10 lbs in two months.  My face_ chest and back now break out occasionally and my sex drive has lowered.  I think that you should talk to your doctor and look this drug up on official websites due to the fact that everyone's body is going to react differently.

The only good thing I found was not having a period. After being on this shot for about a year i started having irregular bleeding and spotting_ i thought it would just go away but it lasted for 3 weeks straight_ then it went away for a week and came back again for another 2 weeks. It was just like having my period for 6 weeks. After the bleeding stopped I started having pains in my kidneys and started vomitting_ I went to the doctor with a 103 degree temperature and they did all kind of tests and ultrasounds_ and guess what_ they found nothing wrong_ the only thing i could blame all of this on is depo. This has happened to me in 3 different instances now and they still cant find anything wrong. Also_ I find that I can get mad over the smallest little things and I can get depressed very easily. I gained about twenty pounds but that didn't really bother me that much. Now my periods have gone away again for a while. But while having intercourse one night I started experiencing severe cramps and then I vomitted_ this has also happened to me on a few occasions_ I've had my physical and the doctor saw nothing wrong. I think I might go off of the needle becuase I'm afraid that it will affect my fertility in the long run_ it just seemed like the most convenient choice for my busy life.,F,20,2  years,1/12/2005Email,Depo-provera

Now 3 weeks later I am feeling absolutely horrible. After seeing my doctor he sent me to the hospital as he couldn't explain the shortness of breath and chest pains and thought I may have a heart problem. The only explanation the ER doctors could come up with was that I'd stopped Depo.  For the last week I've been having shortness of breath_ needing to yawn all the time_ feel like I'm going to throw up but don't_ dizziness_ tiredness_ chest pain_ tingling an numb hands and hot sweat_ and terrible headaches.  The doctor said this was likely to be the changing hormone levels in my body.

I suffered from Abdominal pain_ gained 60 pounds in 2 years even when going to the gym_ headaches_ moodswings.....also went to the dr. for what i thought was a ovarian cyst that ruptured because i felt something explode in my stomach and coulnt move_ they could never tell me exactly what it was but did say that depo probably caused it.....have been off the shot since may 2004 after taking it for 2 years and still havent gotten my period back. I never wanted to get off this shot because i loved not having my period but im so glad i finally did and regret ever taking it. I was so happy with not getting my period and now i would do anything to start it because its staring to worry me.,,F,20,2  years,1/9/2005,Depo-provera

I may have gain 10lbs and it because I eat like a pig not because of Depo.,I have had heavy bleeding with my period til the point where I had to be hospitalized_ painful intercourse_ and bleeding after intercourse.

How long will I bleed and what other problems will I have.  I have gained 50lbs but I really don't blame Depo.  I am lazy and eat fast food everyday.  I had lost 50lbs in my 5th year on the shot but gained it all back.  I am wondering about my bones in my golden years and still am trying to find information on long term affects.  Everytime I get my shot I always ask that question and I never get an answer.  WHAT ARE THE LONG TERMS AFFECTS???  I guess I will know soon...,F,34,13  years,1/4/2005Email,Depo-provera

My doctor recommended getting a second shot early to stop the bleeding_ but it didn't work.  After 5 months of bleeding_ he now has me on 14 days of estrogen.  It's my first day so I don't know if it's working or not.  I also completely lost my sex drive and gained about 10 pounds.

I am now on it again to help with a severe case of Endometriosis.  I tried Lupron Depot and it didn't take so I went back to the Depo_ turns out my being on Depo earlier helped keep my Endo under control.

Drug should be banned_ irresponsible drug company in my opinion. Not enough known about serious side effects.,I thought at first it was a wonder drug(what women does want a period?)_ but eventually i started to drawn my own conclusions about the serious effects i was noticing on my body. Doctors will tell you nothing about long term and may misdiagnose side effects of this drug.This drug does not have adequate labelling. Before starting i had very normal periods and a pregnancy. After coming off after 7yrs i bled non-stop for 7mnths and now have cysts on my ovaries and no period_ possibly Polystic ovarian syndrome. I completely blame depo for the problems i'm now facing_ and wonder after 3 yrs of being off it if by body will be able to get back to normal.

2213, 3, patch irritated my skin,I got the shot once. For the most part I had no real side effects_ I only gained like 2 pounds_ my thighs got a little thicker and my butt got a little bigger (which i don't have a problem with). I got the shot in August after that i didn't get my period like they told me_ but in October I started spotting and the continued for a whole month. I was takin off my mothers health insurance and my doctor said she was going to charge me 150 to give me the shot so I didn't go back for the next one.,Now after the shot its like i won't stop bleeding. I was started spotting in the middle of October for almost all of November. When it stoped it was only for a day or two because then I got my period which was heavy for 1 day then pretty lite. I normally get my period for 4 or 5 days but I've had it for a little more than 2 weeks_ it goes for lite to heavy and heavy to lite. Its just crazy because I've been bleeding since October and its now December. The shot kept me from getting pregnant which i wanted_ but I didn't want the whole spotting thing.

2214, 5, Easiest birth control method.,Extreme fatigue_ Zits_ decreased lubrication_ panic-feeling/nervousness_ depression (whereas I was NOT depressed before hand).,So basically I've 'experimented' with Depo for a while. I'm 22. Got on for the first time at 16. Noticed immediately feeling much more lazy and mopey_ but had no other unreasonable side effects worth mentioning for a few years.... When I was 19 I decided to get off it for a year_ and see what happened. BOOM. During that year I lost weight_ was horny as hell_ happy_ and perhaps the most productive and energetic that I've ever been in my entire short life. Worst part was that when my periods came back_ they were quite irregular. I got back on after I turned 20_ and the side effects have been much worse this time around. SEVERE depression and panic attacks came out of NOWHERE. 20lb weight gain. Break-outs. And left to my own devices_ I could probably sleep 15 hours a day. It's awful. I just got my latest shot this week because my doctor told me it was 'too late' to start a pill pack... hmmm. Come to find out that's not true_ so I plan on dropping the Depo_ AND my doctor. Hope that helps someone. A lot of your stuff helped me.-Jessica,F,22,5  days,12/10/2004,Depo-provera

2216, 1, Contraceptive/No period,About 30 lbs weight gain_ extreme hair loss_ total loss of sex drive_ loss of lubrication_I freak out over the smallest things_ depression_ constantly hungry_ insomnia_ bloating_ fatigue.,I started taking depo because I was starting to getting into a serious relationship and didn't really want to worry about getting pregnant and the no period thing was awesome. But the only thing my doctor told me was that I might gain about 5 pounds. yeah right!!! My now husband thinks that I don't really want him anymore_ and when we do attempt to have sex it's very painful. I have always had thick hair but since I started taking the shot my hair has thinned out a lot. I still get my period right before I'm due for another shot and I never really had severe cramps bfore_ but now it's terrible almost unbearable at times. My muscles ache almost all the time especially my back and neck area_ My bra size used to be a 36C now it's a 38C. Just about everything seems to get me down. But the crazy thing is I know I'm not pregnant but it sure looks like I am. I am due for a shot in December but I'm not going back.

My periods stopped straightaway_ but was then plagued by spotting regularly_ accompanied by my normal cramps.  I lost all sex drive (no wonder this is so good at preventing pregnancy_ all it does it to promote abstinence!) and became depressed and aggressive_ almost causing the break-up of my long term relationship.  I went from enjoying a regular and exciting sex life with my partner to being repulsed by even the thought of him touching me.  When I could muster the drive_ it was painful as my natural lubrication had completely dried up.  My skin has become painful and very oily and spotty.  Similarly my hair is awfully greasy.  My mood became very despondant_ and I became very depressed.  I used to be a very fit person_ and despite eating and exercising to exactly the same as I had always done_ I gained 15lbs in the first year.   This is still very difficult to shift_ and as yet_ I'm still fighting the extra 10lbs.  Please do not take this drug_ it shouldn't be on the market.,F,21,1.5  years,11/28/2004Email,Depo-provera

Then all of a sudden I had this horrible odor and never even thought that it was due to the shot. Then the weight gain started and so far have gained 25 lbs. and I am always bloated and look like I am pregnant. Then the migraines started and the anxitey. Mood swings_ I became angry at my kids for no reason. I was schedled to get a MRI for my headaches when I started searching online for things that cause headaches and I found all these stories of woman who had the same problems as I did and that we were all on the same birth control. I skipped my last shot and will never put that poison in my body again. I will tell everyone how dangerous the shot is....It has made me miserable.

2221, 3, To regulate menstruation,Weight gain_ lethargy_ worsened acne_ increased depression_ loss of lubrication and sex drive.,I started taking depo because my periods were very heavy and painful_ even on the pill_ and often associated with migraines.  Initially I had a lot of spotting but this was still preferable to my period_ and then the bleeding stopped altogether.  As long as I got my injections on schedule_ I could prevent the spotting_ and had no periods or migraines.  However_ I did have a history of depression before I started depo provera and this worsened the longer I stayed on it_ and changed as well.  I used to be a skinny insomniac who survived on the occasional candy bar and couldn't nap if my life depended on it...  on depo_ I gained close to 50 lbs and was so tired all the time I spent whole days sleeping_ only getting up to eat.  When I was awake I was cranky and irritable_ and I lost all interest in sex_ and even if I could dredge up the urge it was dry and painful.  My teenage acne returned with a vengeance.  At this point_ I need to lose the weight and regain my old level of activity or I will very shortly become Type II diabetic_ according to blood tests.  I have decided to stop taking depo_ and with the help of Weight Watchers I am already losing the weight.  I am only spotting now_ but I fear my horrible periods will return soon...  I would still recommend depo provera to someone with very painful periods_ but the depression (which also causes weight gain and loss of libido) whould be watched closely and treated if necessary.,F,23,3  years,11/19/2004,Depo-provera

Shot cured this problem but I am due for a shot in two weeks and not getting it. I can't wait to go off to see if I lose weight. My dr. said I wouldn't gain weight if I just watched what I ate. I have always eaten healthy and exercised so I thought this would be easy - not so when you are hungry all the time! The pill is not hard to remember to take.

I was told I'd have to make an appt. to talk with the Dr. I told them to cancel my injection_ it wasn't worth the bleeding and lack of sexual drive. That was in Aug. I'm know going through painful and swollen breasts I stopped having any type of period shortly after I cancelled my 3rd appt.

2240, 5, menstrual cycles,can't say i have had any side effects except a decrease in my sex drive which is good for now since im young,starting when i was 12 i had an extremly heavy flow and horrible menstrual cramps..both were so bad that i would miss 2 days each month due to it. i tried 3 different brands of birth control pills and it was such a waste of time. time where all i did was cry and worry if i would be able to go to school or not finally i decided to talk to my doctor about the shot all i can say is it changed my life my life is great i still have irritable bowel syndrome and im only 15 now but no more worrying about having to go to school when that time of the month comes i was actually going through a depression due to it and partly because of the IBS but one problem is completly gone i pretty much gave up when i decided to try the shot because of the disappointing results of the 3 different brands of birth control pills i kept thinking well it might help it a bit if im lucky..no it fixed everything i didnt even have spotting and no cramps at all before i was on the shot i had the cramps so bad for 2 days that i couldnt stand i could only lay on a heating pad all day. My doctor has me taking 2 calcium pills a day since im so young and my bones arent done growing i have only been on the shot for 6 months and im very pleasedfeel free to email me at anytime,F,15,6  months,10/12/2004Email,Depo-provera

I couldn't make any lubrication and sex has become painful. It makes sex horrible for me and my poor boyfriend. After 2 years of no improvement I stopped taking the shot. It's only been a couple of days so I dont' know what will happen. The vaginal dryness is the worse and creams don't help. It's this awful burning sharpness.

When I finally quit taking it_ the nastiness STAYED. It's been 7 months now since my last shot_ and I am still dealing with this problem. DON'T TAKE DEPO! I also have not lost the weight and had to buy all new clothes. I guess these idiots think we are made of money!,Depo Provera is POISON. It should NOT be on the market. The risks and side-effects are too great. After the thousands of horror stories I've read_ I can't believe doctors aren't taking notice_ BUT THEY AREN'T_ so do your own research and don't let your doctor talk you into taking this drug. It's P-O-I-S-O-N! Always remember_ doctors get incentives (trips_ gifts_ dinners_ etc.) for prescribing certain drugs. Do not be fooled into thinking that your doctor is giving you drugs for your own good. Research everything you are prescribed.

I stopped taking in oct 2002 because my doctor said it should take about a year to get pregnant after stopping.  Well it is now Sept 2004 and I still am unable to get pregnant.  I had been on it from July 1998 until Oct 2002_ so I do not know what all the effects it has had on my reproductive system_ but I am praying that it has not permanantly effected my system.  I long to get pregnant now_ and I still have not.

No period after 2nd dose.,This has got to be the worst thing I've ever done to my body. Initially it was great_ no period...YEAH!!! But that was definitly not worth what has happened since. I've gained 23lbs. in 18 months. After my second shot_ I started having asthma problems_ which hasn't been an issue since High School. I really have no interest in sex_ probably due to the dryness I experienced the last couple of times. I don't recommend this product to anyone. I've decided not to get my next shot after reading similiar complaints_ so hopefully the weight will soon drop and I'll want/enjoy sex again.,F,25,18  months,8/18/2004,Depo-provera

My appetite is difficult to control_ I feel like I am constantly starving_ I realize that it is the depo and I CAREFULLY watch what I eat_ you will definately gain 20 pounds if you are not aware of what you are eating. You can control the weight gain_ work out_ watch what you eat.  People like to use the shot as an excuse _also aging is the biggest factor in weight gain_ don't be suprised if you can't fit into your high-school jeans 8 years later.... In total I have gained less than five pounds........My biggest complaint is the low sex drive_ I miss the way things were_ but I don't miss the horrible PMS and mood swings that made every month miserable.

My last three pill years I had midcycle spotting every month that lasted for at least a week. This last year I started bleeding during sex. I was eventually diagnosed with endometriosis_ and decided to chose Depo as my non-surgical treatment. I am just about to go for my second shot_ but have not noticed any serious side effects: just a few headaches and spotting_ which is nothing new for me. The bleeding is an inconvenience_  but I've had no cramps (which I had with the pill) and I've had several spot-free weeks which has made this worthwhile for me.

The only reason I let myself bleed that long is because my doctor convinced me it would stop. Finally_ after a year_ another doctor told me I'd never stop bleeding and took me off Depo. I went from a nice person to extremely angry for no reason. I did not want sex. If sex did occur_ I was as dry as a bone. My legs tingled all the time_ and oh_ lord! The headaches.

My migraines have gone through the roof.  Weight gain.  Acne.  My B12 level floored and I had to start taking weekly shots to just be able to function normally.,DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT READING ALL OF THESE COMMENTS.  It has been very scary and I am exhausted from dealing with all of these symptoms.

2274, 2, Birth Control,weight gain (about 5 lbs)_ acne_ depression_ continual spotting after getting off the Depo,This was the first and only form of birth control that I tried.  I thought it would be the safest and most discreet way of preventing pregnancy because I was having sex very often.  My sex drive did not decrease and it did what it was supposed to do-it prevented pregnancy.  Nevertheless_ I knew from the start when I fainted twice at the doctor's office and had a minor ceizure after reciving the shot that there was something shady about the drug.  I gained weight_ got acne_ and I would cry often for no reason.  I am off the depo now and I am continually spotting a little every day in addition to my period which now comes regularly.  I hope to get back to normal and I wouldn't recomend this to anyone--the risks are far greater than the benefits.

Almost immediately after I started developing anxiety_ depression_ excema_ etc...the things I listed above.  After the second shot I just could not handle the anxiety anymore and decided not to go back for another.  I am still experiencing side effects from the drug and my sex drive has not gone back to where it was before.  My acne is worsening (I have never had pimples in my life - so this is very disturbing)_ my excema will not go away_ the anxiety still comes and goes_ I still get tenderness in my breasts before periods and have grown a cup size.  My periods are beginning to regulate themselves back onto a 28 day cycle - THANK GOD_ but my hair is not as shiny as it used to be....it look dull and lifeless.  Please do not take this...it's not as easy to quit as the pill...it's not worth it to experience this.  The doctors refuse to believe there is anything wrong with this form of birth control.By the way_ I have been doing research and Depo provera is responsible for a lack of production in the hormone called prostaglandins which help with many different functions of your body...one being acne and another joint pain.  You should try to have a blood test run and see if your doctor can help with getting your hormone levels back on track.,F,23,2  times,7/2/2004Email,Depo-provera

I was eventually diagnosed with endometriosis but the coincidence is too much for me having never had ANY period problems before this.

Maybe just unlucky.,Periods took 2 years to come back  - during that time a bleed for 2 weeks_ off two weeks repeatedly.Other family members have used it with varying results - one fine apart from small weight gain and  low libido_ another lots of weight gain (always round hips_ belly) and fatigue.,F,34,6  months,6/21/2004,Depo-provera

Being iron defiecent_ it's great not having a period-I have improved energy throughout each month.  I have not experienced much weight gain_ infact since being on the shot_ with exercise I have been able to loose over 10 pounds in the last 6 months.  I switched from taking a pill to the shot so maybe that is the reason I have not experienced such outrageous side effects as others.

2292, 1, birth control,complete hell,no sex drive_ which I guess is fine b/c my period hasn't stopped..  now on anti-depressants b/c of clinical depression.. cramps so bad I can't stand up (need 800mg of advil to help)...  on a 1200 cal/day_ LOW fat diet_ 4-day week gym b/c I'm afraid that my story is starting to sound just like other womens' and I don't want the next chapter of mine to be,F,25, ,4/25/2004,Depo-provera
2293, 1, contraceptive,lack of energy_ mood swings_ concentration loss_ in a 'state of daze'_back/ stomach cramps_ head-aches_ problems with speach (pronounciation and using right words)_ mood swings_ nausea_ 52 lbs weightgain mostly in 5 months AFTER stopping with Depo_ fluid retention (bloating)_ constipation_ pain in joints_ hairloss_ painfull breasts (gained a cup-size)_ eczema (dry sensitive skin)_ acne AFTER depo-use,Before you start (or continue!!!) with depo_ have a look at the guestbook belonging to this site www.abcinternetmarketing.com/depo-provera/Here you will see that my story is not out of the ordinary. Women tell there story of all the side-effects they experienced even as late as 2-5 years AFTER depo-use!!Please do not take it unless there is no other contraceptive you can have for medical reasons.As for me:My whole hormonesystem got a huge blow and got blocked in ways that influenced all my bodily functions. It slowly built up in 6 months. So much so_that after 3 shots my life and activities droped to a minimal level. Friends said I seemed only barely alive_ but I hardly remember...After 13 months off depo I am slowly getting more of a normal life again (able to socialise and do some activities). Before I used to do sports 8-11 hrs a week_ I am a physical therapist so had an active job too. However in half a year on depo I found it was strenuous enough to walk to the toilet_ let alone doing shopping i.e. I stoppped after 4 shots (1 year) as I could not imagine anything else was causing all my problems. Doctors can not 'prove' it was depo_ but it is most likely as nothing else in my daily routines/ habits changed.I would not recommend it as you never know how it will react on you. >5% of women get these side-effects to some extent_ 1-5% get even more serious side-effects. It is not worth the risk_ even when having no menstruation is nice :o). Please do not take it unless there is no other contraceptive you can have for medical reasons!!!,F,27,1  years,4/20/2004Email,Depo-provera
2294, 1, Birth Control,Decreased interest in sex_ extremely painful intercourse.,The first 1 1/2 years on depo were great.  No periods - that's why I went on it in the first place.  However_ as time went on I noticed that sex was becoming a bit painful.  It got to the point that when I went to the doctor about it she could barely examine me as it caused me so much pain.  She told me it was because of the Depo. I am now waiting for the shot to wear off and hope I get back to normal has quickly as possible.  I would NOT recommend that anyone take this.  This side effect has been  horrible.  I've been doing a lot of reading since this has happened to me and realize that my hair loss_ memory loss_ and irritability may have something to do with the Depo as well.  I think this is a nasty drug_ and doctors need to be more upfront in telling patients about the side effects.,F,42,3  years,4/20/2004,Depo-provera

2300, 5, birth control,Possible weight gain_ but weight has been an issue for me my entire life_ so I can't easily blame it on the depo. Low- to non-existant sex drive.,This is the best birth control I've tried so far--except the lack of sex drive...which is an ironic twist_ since I started taking Depo because we were having sex all the time!,F,30,5  years,4/4/2004,Depo-provera
2301, 1, Birth control,Excruciating migranes lasting 1-2 days_ 8 or 9 times a month_ unaffected by painkillers. Spotting between periods_ 3 week long periods_ complete lack of sex drive. 9 months after stopping injections cycle eventually re-established_ but I now get cramps and migranes with each period_ which I never had before.,Doctors refused to believe Depo was causing migranes and wanted to put me on steriods for life_ said the migranes were not possible side effects. They had to agree I was right when as soon as I stopped the injections_ the migranes stoped. No information provided to me on possible side effects_ otherwise I would never have taken it!!!,F,25,6  times,3/28/2004,Depo-provera

2304, 4, contraceptive,,I like the fact that I don't need to worry about forgetting to take my pill every morning_ and also the pill gave me migraines which I have never had before_ and that depo-provera stops my periods which were quite painful_ and just a pain in the neck to be honest.

2309, 1, Birth Control,I immediately went into anaphylactic shock moments after getting the shot and almost died in the ER that day. I was in bed for days after that and gained 10 to 15 pounds that week even though I ate nothing and drank little more than a glass of water each day. I never got another shot. 8 years later_ I still have problems sleeping_ memory loss_ my hands are very shaky_ I am always exhausted_ and I periodically suffer from heart palpitations.,Doctors will tell you that there is no possible way for depo provera to have these side effects_ but it does. Many other women suffer far worse than I did / do.,F,33,1  times,9/27/2003,Depo-provera
2310, 2, birth control,i had bleeding or spotting EVERY single day while i was using depo.,other than the bleeding this drug was great.  i didnt have to worry about taking a pill every day and i didnt gain any weight at all (in fact_ i lost weight).  but the bleeding was annoying and unbearable.  i put up with it for an entire year hoping it would go away because the other people i knew who used this said they didnt have a period at all (which would have been nice).,F,27,1  years,9/20/2003,Depo-provera
