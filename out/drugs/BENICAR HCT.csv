0, 4, HBP,None really it works but now the price is out of control which is very sad. The price has increased several times over the past few years to the point where my cost has at least doubled. I have BCBS. Even with 30 day discount card of $70 provided by Benicar (which is the maximum for 30 day supply) my price is about $100/mth. If I ever have to go up to 40/12.5 my cost will increase to about $175/mth (current pricing). Absolutely ridiculous and sad for those of us that it works for.,For everyone with bad side effects like cramping lethargy etc please google dehydration. The HCTZ in the drug can cause most of the effects described so try Benicar without the HCTZ before giving up. Not everyone needs a diuretic. However_ I  will be looking for a different medication because of the price!!,F,55,3  years20/12.5 1X D,6/20/2016,Benicar hct

4, 3, Hypertension,Although it was effective in controlling my hypertension (from BPs as high as 210/120 reducing them to normotensive readings averaging 120/65) unfortunately I experienced side effects such as GERD_ abdominal discomfort/bloating and malaise. Since the ARB class of drug proved so effective I was switched to Losartan without the diuretic and besides coming in a generic...which Benicar does not... I have the experienced the same benefits without the negative side effects!

5, 1, High blood pressure,This drug damn near killed me!  I was on a lower doseage for apx. 1 1/2 year until the doubled my medication in March of last year.  I felt crummy on many fronts from the beginning but when they doubled my medication all hell broke loose.  I was so fatigued the doctors put me on a narcoleptic medication so that I could minimally function 10 - 12 hours per day.  My GI problems  wouldn't allow me to leave the house for any significant period of time.  The urination was just terrible... had severe difficulty making it to my office each day (1/2 hour from home).  My nails (finger and toe) began to peel and breaking back into the quick.  The most troublesome by far was the tremendous hair loss.  Besides losing apx. 70%  of my hair in 11 months I constantly felt like I had fire aunts on my head.  The itching and burning nearly drove me out of my mind.  Also the ongoing Potassium drops were problematic.  I ran to every Doctor imaginable and all could not believe it was this medication.

20, 1, High blood pressure,At first the side effects included weight gain_ muscle cramps_ and hair loss.  Then I started having digestive issues_ including bloating_ constipation and occasional diarrhea.  Lots of tests to find the problem including an endoscopy with biopsies.  Found the opening between stomach and intestines constricted so opened it.  Four years after taking this med I was hospitalized .  My blood pressure was way too low_ potassium level low_ severe dehydration and kidney failure.  Nearly died.,Other than a low dose aspirin this was the only medication I was taking.  During my hospitalization I had another colonoscopy and endoscopy and diagnosed with microscopic colitis.  A year earlier they had done the same tests checking to see if I had celiac disease.  I did not but even tried a gluten free diet and it didn't help.  This time they recommended I go on a steroid.  I refused.  They put me back on Benicar HCT a week after my hospitalization and I within an hour I began vomiting violently and had diarrhea at the same time.  Back to the emergency room when it subsided.  A week later took another Benicar and the same thing happened.  That's when I found the Mayo Clinic study on the drug and then changed doctors.  I have to admit that when I first started taking this drug it controlled my blood pressure very well without any intolerable side effects.  Other drugs I had tried caused heart palpitations and other side effects.  But_ if you take Benicar_ be aware that issues can develop several years after starting this drug.  I am happy I went to the emergency room when I did! and by the way! I made a visit to a quick care and to a family doctor just a few days before my trip to the emergency room and not one of the doctors thought it was my medication_ even though I suspected it and shared that with them.,F,60,5  years20 mg 1X D,4/23/2014,Benicar hct
21, 5, High Blood Pressure,When prescribed by my doctor he started me off at a low dose samples.  Once finding the right dosage he gave me a prescription. He also gave me the website and literature about Benicar HCT and told me to read it carefully and so I did.  The side effects are listed and It made me fully aware when starting the medication.  At first was dizziness when doing heavy lifting or in the direct sun light at extended periods of time.  I no longer have that side effect.  The other side effect is frequent urination which is common in a Bp med with hct.  No other side effects.  The literature will tell you to drink plenty of water as for hct takes a toll on your kidneys.  My blood pressure started at 190/95 and since I been on benicar hct it has dropped to 134/84 so it's a great Bp medicine but my advise to others is research and make sure it's right for you.,,M,36,4  months40-12.5,11/25/2013,Benicar hct

Have taken Losartan and Losartan HCTZ that I have outgrown_ my body got immuned to them I think.  Then I was prescribed w/ Benicar HCT 40mg/25mg.  On the 4th day taking this benicar_ while playing basketball_ I experienced leg cramping like I had when I first started on Losartan HCTZ.  I checked my BP that night_ had a lowest reading of 101/52. I felt some mild lightheadedness but felt OK overall.  But on the 6th day of taking this Benicar_ I experienced a very severe cramping while playing basketball which started from my thighs up to my torso!  Driven home by a friend_ cramps continued at home and in dire agony I asked my wife to take me to the hospital.  In the ER I was given intravenous rehydration and after 4hrs was released.  I know very well and I had muscle cramps before but that time it was so severe that really frightened the hell out of me_ I could not breathe because almost my whole body except from the neck up were cramping alternately.  I am kind of pain tolerant but it was so severe cramping and pain that I have never experienced before.

27, 1, Hypertension,Trouble breathing_ frequent urination,My Dr. prescribed this medication last year and I took it for several months.  I began having trouble breathing_ but attributed it to the fact that I'm a smoker.  My company switched insurance and they wouldn't fill the script without going through hoops_ which during this time I went without and didn't notice my breathing had returned to normal. Recently started on it again and the breathing issue returned.  I didn't realize that the Benicar HCT was the reason. This was a severe side effect for me. I literally had no air.

This has gone on for at least 6 weeks.  After eliminating the Asthma theory I thought I inhaled a dog hair or something.  Then I thought allergies and tried allergy pills with no effect on the constant cough.  Then accidentally I missed my BP meds one day and the next day I felt less of a cough.  When I started back up the cough returned in full force!   Now I stopped again 3 days ago and the irritation causing me to cough is gone_ but I am left with a chest infection.

I stopped sleeping almost around the clock even though I have sleep apnea I don't feel so sleep deprived.

I also suffer from a Degenerative Disk so my back hurts anyway but since I've stop this script I haven't been hurting near as much even with the Fibro_ back pain_ and migraines.

It controls my hypertension very well.,Benicar HCT is not available in generic for yet. It may be offered in generic in 2016_ according to the web. It is very expensive to buy_ without insurance to cover at least part of the cost. The price here in OH is approximately $160.00 for a 30 day supply. Benicar HCT website does offer a payment assistance card. It reduced the price of copay to $25.00 per month_ but only if you have a primary insurance plan. If you don't have insurance_ it will reduce the price by $25.00_ making your cost still $145.00. That makes no sense to me_ but that is how the plan works (small print). The plan is offered directly from Benicar HCT's website. It is called the Right Fit plan. You enter your information and you can print a temp card to use_ until they send you a card.

56, 5, hypertension,After trying 4 other medications for hypertension all of which gave me persistent side effects ranging from dizziness to a chronic sore throat and cough_ my doctor FINALLY switch my medication to Benicar HCT.  It worked immediately to bring down my blood pressure with a relatively low dosage (20-12.5mg) and I had absolutely no side effects from the first dose.,Now my prescription plan has been switched to another provider and Benicar HCT is not on the approved list.  I am now being force to try another medication for hypertension Diovan HCT  before my doctor will complete the approval process for the Benicar.  To buy the Benicar HCT without a prescription plan the cost would be over $250 for a 90 day supply that I used to get for a co pay of less than $50.  I'm disgusted with my doctor for not pushing the approval process and taking the easy way out and just recommending one of the other medications.

I switched to Diovan_ after 2 weeks my blood pressure shot up to 235/175 and was jumping all over the place_ I had severe headaches_ dizziness_ and flu like symptoms.  It was very scary!!  I still had some Benicar left so I switched back.  The following day my blood pressure was 117/72 and stayed within a few points of that_ all headaches_ dizziness_ and bad feelings went away.

62, 5, High BP,Benicar HCT 40/12.5.  Possibly a slight cough_ although my doctor says it isn't due to this medication.  I've had the cough with other BP meds as well_ and it started when I started taking them.  Could be acid reflux but I don't have all the symptoms for that.,After taking Benicar HCT for about a year I dropped the HCT and now take only Benicar. I prefer not taking medications and the reason for the diuretic was to deal with water retention.  That was presumably caused by too much sodium (salt).  I cut way back on salt and that helped so I tried dropping the HCT.  My BP did go up a little as a result. Overall_ I've had virtually no side effects with Benicar HCT or Benicar without HCT_ except the possibility of a slight cough.  Again_ not sure the Benicar is causing the cough.

I was started at the 40 mg/25 HCT and I hope it is effective.  I read through the symptoms and what I see to expect_ is muscle cramps. Take not that no one mentioned a potassium supplement with the HCT as you usually need potassium.   Also the age of some folks and slowing down will also make you feel tired.  The drug seems to have good results in lowering pressure and it seems the side effects of feeling lousy are common. I hope it works for me. My BP was 220/122 when I began.

Within 3 weeks the most serious symptoms disappeared.But it took several months for the remaining angina-like symptoms to slowly abate but not completely. So not sure if these are medication-related_ yet.,"I do not buy the ""Herxheimer"" syndrom explanation that someone on this forum suggested: tests indicated no sign of infection at all.

107, 5, Extremely high BP: 215/85,A little dizzy upon rising at first for several weeks and somewhat tired feeling_ due to drop in blood pressure. Also some muscle ache in legs firs several weeks.

108, 4, Hypertension,Frequent urination in the a.m. first 3- 5 hours after taking.,BP was 158/100 or so when I first started taking. Now my bp runs about 120/78 or less most of the time.

The only thing I would like to change is that Anthem puts it on its regulatory or formulatory list so that it doesn't cost me $40.00 co-insurance versus 15 or 20.  I stopped taking it due to cost and am trying Hyzaar...on the Anthem list.  Get with the program Anthem.,M,34,3  months,7/12/2007,Benicar hct

115, 1, hypertension,Restless legs beginning in the afternoon and continuing through the night. Symptoms were so severe at night I would have to get out of bed and pace for an hour or two before going back to bed--this on top of being EXHAUSTED!!!

I have never been on any kind of blood pressure medication before and since this was the newest one out ... my doctor prescribed it ... it hasn't lowered my blood pressure and I feel terrible.,I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.

120, 1, high blood pressure,Always tired_ muscles become exhausted very quickly when exercising with weights or track_ negative mental impact also.,"I got the impression that my internist prescribed this medicine because he had been told about its general results by others. It seems manys docs prescribe based on the local medical buzz and then their patient results.  What if a patient gets seriously ill from a prescription?  Opps_ that was a sacrifice? Docs need to spend time researching the drug maker_ the functional specifics_etc.  The ""if you make it_ they will prescribe it"" drug company attitude should be professionally challenged by more than the FDA.",M,54,120  days,9/16/2006Email,Benicar hct
