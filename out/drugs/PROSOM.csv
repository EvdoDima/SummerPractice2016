0, 1, insomnia,did not make me sleepy at all.  I took it and still was awake all night long,I only tried prosom because my insurance doesn't want to pay for Ambien.,F,40,30  days,10/7/2009,Prosom
1, 5, for RLS (restless legs syndrome),I call Prosom my Godsend.Side effect is feeling groggy in the morning.I wonderif I'm fatigued during the day from my fibromyalgia or perhaps the Prosom. I think a combination of the two.   ,I try to limit to the  recommended max of 2 mgs. before bedtime.Some nights I need to take an extra mg. (half tablet) for added relief.  I could not tolerate my life without Prosom's relief.Restless legs is a torment,F,59,15  years,3/22/2006Email,Prosom
