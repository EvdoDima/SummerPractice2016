0, 2, RLS,About 3 hours after my dose_ I get a 'drugged' feeling in the head_ similar to Alcohol intoxication_ but not pleasant. Then_ about 6 hours after my dose_ I awake with a very unpleasant feeling of restlessness & distress throughout the entire body. This feeling comes and goes for a few more hours_ and then I can sleep. Since starting this med_ my quality of sleep is greatly reduced. Also_ feelings of irritability and not feeling like myself. If I take the med at 5:00 as recommended_ then I'm useless every evening from 8:00 until I go to bed. Not much hangover the next morning.,Was hoping that I could use Horizant instead of Mirapex_ because Mirapex gives me a number of unpleasant side effects. Unfortunately_ for me_ Horizant is worse than taking Mirapex. In fact_ I'd also say it's worse than taking nothing at all and just suffering with the RLS.,M,60,4  days600 mg 1X D,12/4/2012Email,Horizant
