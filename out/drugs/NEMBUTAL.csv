0, 5, Chronic insomnia,Euphoric bliss_ and first class sedation. Also brutally addictive with an added feature_ of disappearing in a spoonful of cold water_ making it 'ideal' for being drawn up thru a #26 TB point for IV injection. It puts you in heaven for a few hours_ and sometimes_ forever.,Yes_ it was the drug found in a dead Marylin Monroe- but remember that MM was murdered. Coroners evidence prove this. I had a second stay in the nut house for detox_ where I met other users_ some of which were taking up to a dozen a day_ and still able to commit crimes. During the 1960's_ dozens of barbiturates were easily available. Its a wonder I am still alive today.But for serious sedation? This stuff cant be beat. Stay away from it- it is total dynamite with a one inch fuse.,M,62,2  years,1/19/2010,Nembutal
