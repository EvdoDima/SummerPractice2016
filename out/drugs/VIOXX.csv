0, 5, Chronic Neck/Back Pain & Migraines,None,I was prescribed this medication just before it was pulled off the market a number of years ago.  It was heaven sent.  I had not had that kind of relief before or since.  I was only on it for 15 days but it was the best 15 days of my life.  As soon as the announcement came out my husband flushed the balance of my prescription.  I have been on many other prescriptions since and nothing has compared.,F,44,15  days 1X D,4/28/2010,Vioxx
1, 1, back pain,nerve irritation/pain throughout left arm,Doctor put me on this a few years ago_ 3 months before it was pulled from the market. Afer taking it for 2 weeks I developed shooting pains in my left arm that got so bad I would cry myself to sleep. It ceased after I went off the medication. A week later I tried vioxx again and the pain came right back_ so I stopped taking it permanently. On top of that it wasn't effective in numbing my back pain.,F,23,4  weeks,1/14/2008,Vioxx

3, 1, Severe Cramping,High Blood Pressure_ Sinusintis_ irregular Heartbeat,This drug eased the discomfort but if I had known the side effects I would of turned it down. I'm still taking meds for HBP_ no history of side effects  prior to taking Vioxx.  I had a Nurse Practitioner state that once I stopped taking Vioxx the HBP would go away_ that's a statement I read on Merck's report. beware_ all the cards are not in on VIOXX.  Next time you get a prescription for a drug_ read the side effects I recently had a Doctor prescribe celebrex to me_ 2 reasons I didn't take them_ I read about the side effects and the commercials they were showing_ in which I'm considered a hight risk for a heart attack if I have HBP.  What the dickens was he thinking or is he like some others_ pushing drugs to patients for a discount or whatever discounts they get.,F,45,16  months,6/12/2007,Vioxx

11, 1, Inflammatory cartilage pain,Rapid heartbeat_ high blood pressure_ found out later it actually did more damage to my cartilage instead of helping to heal it.,"I was given about every NSAID out there_ and none worked.

Subtle things_ like could hear my own heart beat_ sparks from behind my eyes at night_ like maybe lighning outside only it wasn't storming..real weird things.,I believe this is a very dangerous drug.  I just found this site after all these years...It has been almost 4 years since My Vertigo attack from Vioxx.  I believe it caused me to have a stroke_ or TIA.  I woke up from sleeping so sick I couldn't even walk to bathroom I had to crawl to toilet.  I had never been this ill in my entire life.  While I was Vomiting and having diarreah_couldn't open my eyes because of dizzyness_ after about an hour of this my husband heard me and called EMT's and called my Dr. because I could not leave the bathroom.  I felt my left ear gurgling_ that is the only word that I can use that fits.  The EMT'S had to take me to hospital and I spent the day in ER with them_ Dr's_ trying to find something to give me to stop my Vomiting and Diarreah.  They finally gave something to calm my Vertigo.  I went home that night and fell asleep for a few hours.  My sister in-law called me and my husband gave me the phone and I put it to my left ear and I could not hear...To this day I am still deaf in my left ear.

However_ If I EVER mistakenly increased my dosage I suffered the same side effects which were great enough to send me to bed for about 24 hours.,After trying every other NSAID for the debilitating_ maddening pain in my neck_ Vioxx and physical therapy did the trick. The only other treatment that had been as effective were the cortisone injections directly into the neck.

26, 1, Post-op knee pain & arthritis,Both lower extremities swelled like Moon Boots IN ONLY 3 DAYS!  My Dr. said to get off it immediately.,Two weeks of antibiotic therapy_ heavy-duty diuretics_ and elevated legs produced very slow reduction of the swelling.  The aftermath has been chronic venous stasis and recurrent cellulitis (infection of the deep layers of the skin_ causing swelling and blistering)_ which can be life-threatening.  I am now under the care of a vascular specialist_ sometimes have to have both legs wrapped in Unna Boots to be able to put on the compression hose I now have to wear_ and I can no longer wear any of my pre-VIOXX shoes.  I can neither sit at my desk without elevating my legs_ drive my car_ nor be on my feet for any length of time without feeling my skin fighting with the compression hose.

35, 3, Arthritis/Bone Spur Pain in Neck,After 2-1/2 years I began to get reflux that burned my esoughogus and occasional indigestion of tomato laced foods and Coke. This slowly progressed over 6 months until I had strong stomach pain and the onset of IBS for 2 months. The stomach GASTRITIS ruled my life and caused severe nausea. After tests and weeks of elimination dieting we discovered it was indeed the Vioxx. I had an endoscopy today that revealed I did not have an ulcer as previously thought. Nothing was visibly wrong with my stomach lining despite 60 days of hell.,This drug changed my life much for the better after years of headaches and neck pain that was crippling. I have been functioning normally the last few years. I am hoping to still go back on Vioxx at a lower dose in  a couple months. But only after this period away from it. I will no doubt continue to pace it and take periods off.
