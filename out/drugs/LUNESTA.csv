0, 5, Insomnia,Used generic brand Lunesta manufactured by Teva and I did not sleep too good at night and noticed weight gain and my depression had increased...switched to another generic brand made by Orchid..I fell asleep immediately at night and woke up feeling rested and energetic....,The first six months I was fortunate enough to have bought the original brand of Lunesta but my insurance would only cover generic so there is a big difference between the both and the generic by orchid works like the original for me..goodnight,F,50,1  years3mg,8/10/2016Email,Lunesta

5, 2, chronic insomnia,The drug does not work if there's ANYTHING in my stomach_ and about 25 minutes after taking Lunesta generic I have horrible food cravings that I simply cannot control.  Thus_ big weight gains.  I am groggy in the morning_ I awake several times at night to kick off the covers (I'm burning up)_ and about half the time the drug doesn't work for about 4 hours.  I'm also beginning to suspect that Lunesta is contributing to brain fog and slowness to respond to questions_ as well as loss of names and nouns from time to time.,There has GOT to be a better product to help me get to sleep.  The side-effects of Lunesta have become very worrisome and I'm not really sleeping well; I never wake up refreshed.,F,70,6  years3mg 1X D,2/23/2016,Lunesta

7, 2, Insomnia,First couple of days I took it I felt refreshed the next morning. Minus the minor bad taste in mouth_ I was so happy I found a drug that worked. Fast forward a few days and I had extreme nausea and loss of appetite at the same time every night. Also_ HORRIBLE GAS that I was unaware I even had. Would smell so bad people had to walk away and I was unaware it was even me doing it until it happened wherever I went for a few days at the same time. Have never been more embarrassed in my life.

Deduced it was eszopiclone and stopped two nights ago.  Now I cannot fall asleep where before I could_ albeit for minutes at a time due to sleep apnea.  I am really pissed that this drug can be prescribed_ but apparently it works for others. I am still experiencing the daytime effects and hoping they stop soon.  Otherwise I'm Googling class action lawsuit(s).,,M,49,26  days3MG 1X D,7/24/2015,Lunesta

The Lunesta helps me to go to sleep but I still wake up  6-8 times per night with difficulty getting back to sleep.   I would take it and go to bed and felt like someone was standing beside me_ or crawling over me_ bright light that would flicker occasionally.,F,56,4  months 1X D,4/21/2015,Lunesta
17, 3, PTSD,None,Lunesta (the brand name drug) worked very well for me for about 5 years.  I took 1mg about 3-4x/month when I really needed to sleep well.  However_ my latest bottle is the generic_ and it doesn't work AT ALL.  With the generic_ I have difficulty falling asleep_ staying asleep_ vivid dreams that I remember_ etc.  I had NONE of these issues with the brand name drug.  I'd rate the brand name a 5 and the generic a 1.  I'm trying to get in touch with my insurance company to see if they'll cover a bottle of the brand name drug.,F,37,5  years1mg 1X W,4/7/2015,Lunesta

20, 3, Severe Insomnia,No side effects. Initial restlessness maybe.,"I have been suffering from severe insomnia for the last 6 years. I am not sure how it started but alcohol may have some part in it. There was a time when I would drink myself to sleep and then wake up rested. Slowly I realized that the days when I don't drink I was not able to fall sleep. People at work started saying that I look like I am going to cry and I look pillow face all the time. I just suffered and suffered. I tired all the natural remedies. You name it. Melatonin_ Ashwaghanda_  valerine roots_ hops_ amino acids supplements_ GABA_ Tarine_ L-theanine_ hot bath_ nyquil_ hot milk_ honey_ sex_ iSleep Ezy sleep pills_ all kinds of teas_ music_ white noise. I am not exaggerating. I have literally tried everything.  Dr recommended Ambien. Gave me a hangover. Then Sonata..worked for few days.. then stop working...I ""think"" I dont have anxiety but now I have started to accept the fact. I do have severe sleep anxiety. Insomnia has taken so much out of me. I never cried but I wanted to so many times. I never wanted to take prescription meds because of stupid taboo of ""dangerous side effects"" I wanted to fight it myself. 6 fucking years have passed and I still wine about not having a good night sleep. I feel like a loser. I never performed well in college neither at work. I performance is below average. I can go on wining for ever and ever. Now I am taking   Klonopin with 3mg lunesta. it does not knock me out. It still takes me 2-3 hours to actually fall asl",M,30,3  days3MG 1X D,2/1/2015Email,Lunesta
21, 1, severe insomnia,Bad taste in my mouth_ dry mouth_ horrible headache_ very irritable feeling,This did not work at all. I was awake all night. I took it as directed_ on an empty stomach_ and shortly before bedtime because it's supposed to be fast acting. If anything it made me feel like I drank a pot of coffee and I was very_ very irritable. Not impressed one bit. It was supposed to work right away but I'll try it one more time. I wish I could get a refund!,F,30,1  days3mg,1/15/2015,Lunesta
22, 5, Insomnia,None,Lunesta did what it was supposed to do--help me fall asleep. It didn't have the crazy side effects Ambien had if I stayed up on it. I could still function if something happened to interrupt my sleep that needed my attention. The only reason I got off of it is because it was just too expensive month after month when there are less expensive alternatives. If they make a generic_ I would love to go back on it.,M,29,3  monthsN/A 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Lunesta
23, 5, Difficulty falling asleep,It does give you a metallic after-taste in the morning_ but you get over it.,I had a very traumatic experience happen when I was 20 and I had a very difficult time falling asleep and staying asleep. I tried other medications that would give me strange dreams or make me itch. Lunesta has been a lifesaver. I've been taking it for years now and it is the only way I can fall asleep at night.,F,26,4  years3 1X D,11/4/2014Email,Lunesta

27, 5, Insomnia,I've never experienced any side effect_ not even the bad taste.,This drug is a life-saver for me. I take it along with seroquel. I can no longer sleep without both_ but the alternative was worse and had extremely adverse effects for every aspect of my life. Sleep is important_ and this drug allows me to sleep.,F,32,4  years3 mg 1X D,9/14/2014Email,Lunesta
28, 1, Insomnia,My insomnia has come back. I feel nauseated and dizzy all day. It is affecting my job. I have had anxiety_ heart racing_ mood swings. Horrible taste in my mouth! Dry mouth really bad. Sweats and waking up soaked in the middle of the night.,I ended up in the ER last night because I felt so bad. They took all kinds of tests and couldnt find anything so the ER Dr. said I could be having a reaction to the Lunesta. I am starting to be weaned off of it.

31, 5, chronic insomnia,Only that if you do not try to swallow it as quickly as possible with a drink very close at hand to aid in taking it quickly_ it will leave a horrible taste in your mouth that you'll be able to quickly notice as soon as you wake up the next day. This yucky taste will stay in your mouth for almost the entire day_ and there is nothing you can do about it! There is not one thing you can eat/drink that will make it disappear!,Works excellent for me! I am prescribed a small amount to take PRN monthly. I already have been taking Seroquel for insomnia_ but I use the Lunesta when at times_ the seroquel takes too long to start to work and I am ready to go to bed sooner. There is now a generic form of Lunesta available that doesn't resemble the tiny blue pill of regular Lunesta. It is bigger & one of the generic's color is dark yellow/orange It doesn't leave a nasty taste in your mouth like the brand name. Now_ the colors also include blue for generic as well. But this blue generic will also leave the same nasty taste! I always take prescribed generic medications_ and they all work successfully_ but this generic does not work as well as the brand name .It also doesn't seem to be as strong as the regular brand of Lunesta.,F,38,2  years3 MG 1X AN,7/21/2014Email,Lunesta

36, 3, Can not fall asleep.,Chest pains_ random headaches_ short tempered_ I have no desire to do the things I once enjoyed. weight gain_ memory loss,This drug has worked for me. It has stopped working well over the last few years. It puts me to sleep most of the time. I have never had a problem staying a sleep. I have only recently noticed side effects. I have always thought it was simply me_ not the drug. It has become clear that many people in the beginning of my of my treatment noticed a personality change. I refused to believe it was the med. Reading posts on this site makes me open my eyes a bit. I experience chest pains that move around. I have become more or less a hermit. I don't really believe in depression issues. 5 yrs ago I was the life of the party. Now_ I don't want to do anything.  Reading some of these posts_ Im worried that I will have a dependency problem if my Dr. tells me I can stop. I can not stand relying on this med anymore. If anyone has found a better_ more natural method_ please pass it on. I never try and sleep without it. It has been 6+ yrs since I have tried. Also_ will I go thru withdrawal symptoms?,M,42,7  years3mg 1X D,5/20/2014Email,Lunesta
37, 4, insomnia,For those of you who are experiencing a bad taste_ or metal taste when taking this medication_ I alleviated that immediately by not putting the tablet on my tongue.  Instead I place the tablet between my lips_ and when I drink the water_ it naturally goes down without any problems.  If you can avoid putting the tablet on your tongue_ I think your problem with the metal taste will completely subside.,This works very quickly for me.  I wish they made a more long lasting variety because I tend not to stay asleep all night.,F,59,3  years3 mg 1X D,5/14/2014,Lunesta
38, 4, sleeplessness,Bad metalic taste in the morning... sleepy in the morning.,Very happy with this medication... I have read the others that have had bad side effects.  I would say if you feel like you have bugs crawling on you_ and your restless.  Your probably allergic to an ingredient in the Lunesta.  Thats why I use Lunesta... other sleep aids made me feel gittery_ and felt like bugs were all over my skin.  My Doctor told me those are signs of being allergic... not signs that its a bad medicine.. Everyone is wired different.. Use what works best for you.,M,50,3  months 1X D,4/18/2014,Lunesta
39, 3, Couldn't sleep b/c of a back injury,"Was taking Ambien and it lost its effects on me. Now taking the Lunesta. I've been sleeping better_ but  I think the pharmacy must have mixed the blue pills up with another blue pill. I checked with the pharmacy and I have Lunesta_ but ever since I've had erections that tend to stay for a while. Needless to say I don't have to worry about rolling off the bed at night anymore. I guess I may need to contact the doctor if it lasts more than 4 hours. Well my wife ain't complaining so we better enjoy it. Since  its a good side effect Ill keep taking my ""Lunesta"".",,M,27,1  weeks3 mg,3/27/2014,Lunesta

This was a minor annoyance until the morning I fell asleep while walking back to my bedroom and fell down stairs.  My minor injuries could have been serious.,It was an effective sleep aid for me.  It did help with RBD.  In 2 years I did not become addicted.  It only took two nights with moderate insomnia to stop the drug.,M,73,2  years1.5 MG 1X D,11/7/2013,Lunesta

45, 4, Chronic insomnia,bitter taste_ acute credit card debt,It was very effective.  Good while I could still (barely) afford it.  I loved the way it kicked in while I was reading before bed...the words were floating up off of the pages_ it was really cool...then_ my eyes got heavy_ so I'd have to throw down whatever I was reading_ stagger off to the toilet_ and then stagger off to bed_ and then - out like a light!  It worked so fast.  Instead of before (and since)_ where I'd just lie in bed with racing thoughts_ for hours and hours.  That's why this medicine was so effective for me - it stopped all the racing thoughts!,F,42,1  years3 1X D,10/25/2013,Lunesta
46, 3, severe insomnia,Metallic aftertaste eventually goes away after extended use.  I experience respiratory issues when taking a higher dosage (4 mg) and constant post-nasal drip.,Works much better than Ambien CR but still not perfect.  I have definitely developed a resistance to it.  Used to take 1 1/2 mg. but now have to take 3 - 4 mg. and don't sleep as well as I initially did. At most_ I get 5 hours of sleep.  Extremely important to take on an nearly empty stomach or it doesn't work at all.,F,52,7  years3 mg 1X D,9/28/2013,Lunesta

Out of nowhere I feel like I am starving_ and head to the kitchen and eat and eat. Every night I say I am NOT going to do that_ but every night I do.  Makes me mad to be taking in so many calories and not being able to control it.  But it truely makes me very hungry.  I can't believe no one else has this side effect :(,F,53,4  years3mg 1X D,8/24/2013,Lunesta
48, 2, Chronic Insomnia/ Chemo Side Effect,Not falling asleep or staying alseep,I switched to Lunesta because Ambien would not keep me asleep - I'd rather have any sleep right now so will switch back to Ambien because that did work at least for a couple hours.

51, 1, Poor sleep quality,Excruciating sinus headache_ ringing in my ears_ tired all the time,When I first took this drug_ it was great. I slept really well and the side effects were minor. After a couple of months_ I was tired all the time and the headaches and ear ringing were horrible. When I tried to reduce the dose_ I could not sleep. After quitting_ the rebound insomnia was horrible. I did not realize this drug was so addictive. I think the FDA made a terrible mistake approving it for extended use. My Dr. said she has never seen anyone have this problem before. I am going to do a short course of valium with the hope of getting back to normal. YIKES! I would never take a hypnotic again and would recommend that people not use them for extended periods.,F,47,6  months3 mg 1X D,4/16/2013Email,Lunesta

I was put on lunesta because my ambien were only letting me sleep for 2 horus at a time per day_ thus making me feel like i was in the military again.

61, 1, Insomnia,The taste itself keeps me wide awake!  All I can do is think about getting rid of it.  It's not just the mouth but my mucous membranes.  So terrible!  I don't know how a drug can be prescribed for insomnia when the taste and smell is a constant.  I drank a huge glass of water prior to taking as suggested and within 15 minutes the taste and smell are almost unbearable. I did find that organic almond slices work temporarily to get rid of that taste/smell but as soon as I've eaten them_ it's back. At the 45 minute mark_ I get drowsy and that seems too long for a sleep aid to work. In not sure that I'll be able to slep tonight.  This is the 2nd time trying this medication and I WILL NEVER take it again.  I'll stick with Ambien or not sleep at all vs taking this drug again.  Sunovion needs to reformulate this med ASAP because I see so many complaints about the metalluc taste on so many messages boards.  I cannot believe its still on the market to be quite honest..  Sunovion claim's to be the #1 branded sleep aid  on the market - the only reason for this is because generic Ambien is available now.,,F,37,2  days3mg,10/28/2012,Lunesta

I find if I start reading or doing anything mind engaging I can often miss the signs of sleepiness and then pretty much ruin that dose.

I've been taking wellbutrin for anxiety for several months_ and i haven't had any panic attacks since then...until yesterday. Now i'm concerned that Lunesta is contributing to my anxiety and depression. In the last couple weeks i noticed a change in my mood but i just thought there was something wrong with me. After yesterday_ i started putting it together and i think Lunesta is the culprit. I'm going to ask my doc about getting off of it.

It worked the first couple of days (although I had the bad taste in my mouth from the first dose.) Then it would only keep me asleep for 3-4 hours a night_ so getting up in the morning was extremely hard since I was so tired and groggy from not getting a full 8 hours of sleep.  My doctor told me to double up temporarily(insurance won't pay for 2 pills a day.)  I slept then_ but the side effects got worse.  I had a constant headache that just would not go away.  And my healthy sex drive went to absolute NO sex drive.  I only stayed on Lunesta about 2.5 weeks.  My doctor just switched me to Ambien.,F,33,2  weeks3mg 1X D,3/25/2012Email,Lunesta

88, 5, Chronic Insomnia,Metallic taste is very rare. There is a slight amnesia effect for what I have been reading in the 5-10 minutes before I fall asleep.,I had tried many other drugs including Klonopin_ Trazadone_ Seroquel_ etc. All either did not work or had terrible side effects. The Lunesta has worked form the beginning and is very consistent. Takes about 20-30 minutes to kick in so I just read in bed until it does. It is easy to wake up also. Sometimes I just pop awake and ready to go. 6 hours per night seems to be fine. I also add 300 mg of Neurontin every night_ which I had picked up from years earlier. I think people need to trying different things until they find what works for them. It took me over 10 years. (Ambien and Ambien CR are in the same family but did not work as well for me.),M,55,2  years2 mg 1X D,11/13/2011,Lunesta
89, 3, insomnia,Bad aftertaste all next day; depression next day; racing heart.,I use Lunesta when Benadryl won't put me to sleep..about once a week on average. I try to take as small a dose as possible. It does put me to sleep and the quality is pretty good for 4-5 hrs. Unlike with Ambien you do get REM sleep with this drug. BUT: over the years I've noticed the next day I'll feel like life is pretty dreary and somewhat down in the dumps. Finally figured out it's probably the Lunesta doing it. And if I take more than 3 nights in a row_ I get crazy heart racing and anxiety before it knocks me out. This is a drug of last resort for me because of the horrid taste it leaves all next day. Lemon juice does counteract it_ as does flushing with lots of water.,F,57,4  days1 mg 1X D,11/5/2011,Lunesta
90, 2, Sleep Aid,We are just now finding out that possibly the Lunesta is causing my symptoms to return.  I dropped back into a severe depression two months after beginning Lunesta.  The doctor has switched many medicines but nothing was working.  I've been chilled_ had anxiety_ deeper depression and during the past month have had serious memory loss.  Completely forgot what my children looked like when they were younger or what my wedding day was like.  SCARY  I have been off of it for five days and still feel awful.  I pray this is the answer.

I was sleeping a solid 8-9 hours per night which I hadn't done in YEARS.  The first few weeks I felt refreshed and energized.  Suddenly I found myself feeling horrible and didn't associate it with the Lunesta for about 3 weeks.  After weeks of spending most of my time in bed or unable to function at all at work my doctor suggested to stop taking the Lunesta.  Mind you~ i was only taking it 4 nights a week.  But after stopping Lunesta for 5 nights I FINALLY felt ""normal"" again on the 6th day.  I no longer feel foggy_ anxious and I can concentrate!

94, 4, To stay asleep,Slight bad taste in mouth in morning_ sometime slight headache_ a little slow to start (grogy/foggy) when I wake up. Vivid realalistic dreams (not nightmares).  I love Lunesta. ,I dont have any problem falling asleep_ just staying asleep I would wake up after about 1 1/2 hour of sleep and flip flop the rest of the night with my brain running at 60mph thinking of all kinds of things one right after another then going back to the original thougt and starting over again. Started taking lunesta to stay asleep started with 1 mg_ then 2mg now I take 3mg and it works the best. I can get a solid 7 hours of sleep now. Metallic taste in the morning is the worst side effect_ but thats not everyday. If I sleep less than 7 hours a little grogy/ foggy in the head when I first get up_ but that stops after a bit. Vivid dreams (3) to date at random times. First dream aprox a month after starting Lunesta. Dream I was walking down a city street seemed like NYC_ but I have never been to NYC walking on the sidewalk by a city trash can with some guy (looked dirty or homeless) digging in the trash can he had his hand in the trash can like he was hiding something and he was looking at me as I past him he had a broken beer bottle in his hand and stabbed me in the right rib cage it seemed so real that I could feel the glass scrape my rib bones_ intense pain and a warm feeling like I was bleeding_ jumped out of bed and stumbled into the bathroom while holding my right side turned on the light looked in the mirror and was shocked to see no blood_ lifted my shirt and no cut I really cant explain how real it seemed it was crazy .,M,44,2  years3 1X D,10/2/2011Email,Lunesta
95, 3, Chronic insomnia,Severe dry mouth. Change in texture of tongue_ feels like it's been scalded with hot coffee. Inflamed taste buds at the tip of my tongue. Cracks in skin at corners of my mouth and dry eyes and skin. Increase in RLS symptoms.,This is my second time taking Lunesta. The first time the dry mouth was so severe that I was sent to a rheumatologist to test for Sjogren's_ no one ever connected it to Lunesta. Got off Lunesta and several other meds and then got on Ambien but was getting up without knowing it and eating everything in the house. Also had conversations that I couldn't remember. Finally I obtained a medical necessity letter to my insurance and went back on Lunesta. All of the dry mouth symptoms returned immediately. My tongue feels raw_ I have the inflamed tastebuds on the tip of my tongue. I also have deep fissures in my tongue again as well as cracks in the corners of my mouth and very dry eyes. I am thirsty all the time and get no pleasure from my favorite chai tea or any other food. I will gladly accept the anorexia but feeling like my tongue is scalded all the time is miserable. I do get good sleep with Lunesta (7 to 9 hours per night) but don't know how much longer I can accept this severe dry mouth. If anyone else has experienced this symptom_ I would love to hear of possible solutions.,F,52,3  weeks3mg 1X D,10/1/2011Email,Lunesta

97, 5, Insomnia,Occasional metallic taste_ fuzzy head in mornings.,Got the metallic taste a few times. For me_ it isn't an issue if I take the pill with a lot of water. It seems like the metallic taste is tied to how long the pill is in my mouth_ and if it touches anything. So the quicker it goes down_ and the less of my mouth it touches_ the lower the chance of getting the bad taste. I get this maybe once a month. I only take the pill Sunday-Thursday for work. If I don't book about 7+ hours of sleep_ I maybe a little groggier in the morning_ but that's not guaranteed. This pill has been a life-saver. Have been an insomniac all my life.

Second round_ the taste seemed to dissipate a hair and my mood deteriorated again_ and I thought Hmmmm  I ended up out of town with only my emergency stock of Ambien.Started again four nights ago and my mood has gone straight down hill.  I jumped down everyone's throats last night -- worst of all my child in exams -- and I was so clearly distraught this morning that the clerk at Home Depot in the gardening department chased after my car to make sure I was OK.

I havent been sleeping and would wake up alot once I did fall asleep. I went to the flight doctor and he gave me Lunesta. He also had Ambien and Restoril. I had taken Ambien before with no success_ i have also taken restoril and it worked great. The doctor wanted me to try the Lunesta over the Restoril because Restoril is much stronger and more habit forming. I will not take Lunesta anymore! I have been so angry the past to days that I have taken it and I more tired than before I started taking it. The smallest things are driving me crazy luckily I havent lashed out at anyone too badly but people have definetly mentioned that I am acting differently.

112, 5, Insomnia/ Hypersomnia,Metallic taste,It's amazing how many negative reviews there are! Telling readers to BE WARE is just not fair. Some things work for some and not others. That's it. My experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have hypersomnia (daytime sleepy)_ and my sleep is completely fragmented. I can do 101 things to try and fix my fragmented sleep_ but it just doesn't matter. I can't control the way my brain goes in and out of the sleep stages. For the first 8-10  months_ Lunesta took 2 hours to take effect. Recently_ it works within minutes which I am loving. Ambien didn't work for me. First_ it felt like a horse tranquilizer- just put me DOWN. Sorry_ not my idea of fun. If i took 10mg it made me soo nauseous. 5mg wasn't enough so I'd wake up mid night and be wide awake. And I did get up in the middle of the night for water and DID NOT remember it at all! Lunesta keeps me asleep and for the most part doesn't leave me feeling drowsy in the AM. I haven't noticed any other side effects out of the ordinary. Sleep deprivation made me crazy and forgetful. And it has not cause any addiction. I hate taking it! Sometimes (rarely)I get naturally sleepy (fall asleep on couch) and don't need the Lunesta and I'm fine. Unfortunately_ this is seldom. For the rest of the nights_ it's Lunesta.

114, 1, Chronic Insomnia,"anxiety_ depression_ fatigue_ lack of energy_ agitation_ muscle spasms_ restless legs_ anger_ crying spells_ a ""control freak""_ brain fog",Never realized all these side effects were due to Lunesta. I had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism (low thyroid) and low female hormones levels within last 6 months. Have been taking levothyroxine and BHRT and thyroid and hormones levels are good and I was still having side effects. Then starting looking into side effects of Lunesta. I decided to stop Lunesta but didn't know that you're not suppose to quit cold turkey. I don't understand why my doctor couldn't have made the Lunesta connection with my symptoms and never warned me about the side effects or stopping it cold turkey. My poor family has been wanting to ship me off somewhere because I have been horrible to live with. It has been 2 weeks since I stopped cold turkey. You get rebound insomnia which is worse than the initial insomnia. I've been depressed and agitated and having been have severe night sweats which are side effects from the withdrawal. I feel this drug has done more harm than good the last 3 years of my life. You can most certainly get addicted and dependent on Lunesta.

Very addictive and has severe withdrawal effects if taken long term.,I've been diagnosed with childhood onset primary insomnia and delayed sleep phase syndrome.  I can't fall asleep until the early hours of the morning_ and even then_ I toss and turn for hours unless I take something to knock me out.  My doctor prescribed this to me (one 7.5 mg pill at night) when I was a seventeen year old struggling to finish the last year of high school while battling severe sleep deprivation.  At first_ it was a godsend.  I even grew to like the bitter taste.  That meant the drug was kicking in and I would soon fall asleep (finally!).  Dreams and nightmares became more vivid.  It knocked me out_ but I would wake up after a few hours_ and if it's taken on consecutive nights_ the groggy hangover effect the next day is almost as bad as sleep deprivation.  Over the years I had to double the dosage.  I get hit with random anxiety attacks during the day if I go more than 24 hours without a dose.  It can be very_ very addictive_ particularly if your insomnia is ongoing and your doctor refuses to try other drug interventions_ as my doctors have.  Often I have to take two or more 7.5 mg tablets at night in order to fall asleep.  I'd recommend it for occasional insomnia_ not as a long-term treatment for chronic insomnia or other sleep disorders.  I've tried to taper off gradually.  But I always relapse and take another Lunesta pill after a few days without sleep_ and the cycle of drug dependence continues.

138, 5, chronic insomnia,other than the metalic taste in the mouth none.  Occasionally it will not work but that is due to eating fatty food prior to taking it.  I started taking lunesta when it first came out and the metalic taste in the mouth was not talked about much.  have found that the taste gets better with use.  I have seen the posts about depression and aggression.  this has not been an issue with me,I was sleep deprived for around 3 years prior to taking medications for it.  I worked night shift for over 20 years and have messed up my body's natural sleep patterns.  what everyone needs to remember is drugs work differently on people.  I have read posts here about ambien etc.  I tried all the other sleep aids.  I can take an ambien and 4 hours later I am still wide awake.  I still wake up at night even with the lunesta_ it is easier to get back to sleep with it.  On average I sleep 4 to 5 good hours each night.  To some that may not seem like alot but when you have sleep studies that show no REM or deep sleep that 4 to 5 hours is a god send to me.  If anyone has any questions I will glady answer them.  As far as costs go yes it is expensive and the insurance companies are doing a good job of making it difficult to get this drug.  Sepracor the maker of lunesta does have a savings program that can help with $50 of your co-pay each month for a year.

Lunesta has been a godsend. I've taken Ambien_ which only pooped out. Benzos only work for panic/anxiety--they do not really help to create a long-term sleep. I tried to go off Lunesta and only found that my sleep patterns_ which are PTSD related and cause depression_ became worse. After a few months off of Lunesta as needed_ I began to develop terrible insomnia_ vivid dreams_ and accompanying anxiety_ which resulted in very little sleep and early morning awakening. Back on the Lunesta_ my sleep becomes much more normal withlittle hangover effect as I take Wellbrutrin in the morning. If I awaken during the night_ I am able to go back to sleep. I feel awake and aware in the am along with the Wellbrutrin. Must be careful with coffee. I prefer the Lunesta rather than the horrible sleep without it. Take the 3mg. Lunesta has make my  life much better. Depression without sleep is horrible. Good idea to keep to you AD and only take when necessary.,F,50,2  years30 mg 1X D,2/12/2010,Lunesta

But I fell asleep at a decent hour_ and woke up in the middle of the night (like I usually do). I couldn't go back to bed. When I did wake up_ I noticed a gross taste in my mouth_ which didn't go away from brushing my teeth.

177, 4, Insomnia,Bitter Taste_ Mild Euphoria_ Mild Relaxation_ Able to Sleep.,Lunesta is to Ambien what a light beer is to two shots of Whisky. Instead of knocking me out and doing all the work for me (which Ambien would typically do)_ Lunesta holds your hand through the getting to sleep process and doesn't necessarily force you into it.  Like most users_ I experienced that strange taste sensation which reminded me of the bitter xanax if it stays on your tongue for too long. I did not hop into the bed for about 45 minutes after taking the pill. During that time I began noticing a slight sense of euphoria_ though it wasn't in relation to any relaxation. Could have been caused by trying a new sleep medicine. I'm sure that excites most inosmniacs.I finally decided that it was about time to see if I could get unconsious for a few hours_ so I hopped in the bed. I turned on each side a time or two_ slowly began to relax_ and I found it quite easy to drift to sleep. I woke up about three times_ and fell back asleep within a minute each time. Woke up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world_ despite that bitter penny and dime flavor permeating my mouth. Would prefer Ambien_ but Lunesta teaches us to sleep while Ambien forces us to sleep.,M,22,1  days,10/16/2009,Lunesta

181, 1, Insomnia,Anxiety_ panic attacks_ heart palpatations_ unable to relax and take naps.,Lunesta worked wonterfully for me for about 30 days. My Dr. prescribed it for insomnia which was the major contributor to high BP. 30 days after I started Lunesta and the BP meds I had a panic attack and assumed it was related to the BP meds and my Dr. concurred. He gave me an antianxiety drug to take if it happened again. It didn't for about another month at which time I started having heart palpitations and fairly regular panic attacks. Again thinking it was related to the BP meds he added another BP med and the problems continued. Anxiety reached the point I began to have IBS which caused me to loose about 36 pounds. My doctor had me see a cardiologist and a GI doctor. None of them ever suspected the Lunesta as the root cause. It was only because I started searching the internet and found all the incidents of anxiety related to Lunesta use that I tied it together. I stopped taking Lunesta and within 6 months I had no IBS probelms_ no anxiety problems and gained 20 lbs back. That was the only medicaion change. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Anxiety is a very serious side effect of Lunesta taken for more than a few weeks.,M,54,3  months,10/5/2009Email,Lunesta

Even worse_ I was aggitated and hostile. I said things to my fiance without thought or care that were insensitive at best and mean at worst. If a noise or motion woke me_ I was angry and mean. I slept off and on for the entire weekend_ only coming out of it by Sunday evening.  I was remorseful for my behavior_ and chose not to have the prescription filled. Unfortunately_ my behavior was apparently so despicable_ my fiance (of 3 years) packed up and moved out without warning on Monday.,I can definitely say_ LUNESTA has ruined my life!,F,52,2  days,9/1/2009,Lunesta

Mainly it just helps and I get 4-6hours sleep on it. Not great_ but enough for me to function. If my anxiety is high_ I take it with a small dose of Xanax per my doctor's instructions. However_ I have been concerned because I am noticing that increasingly I have been waking up and having crying spells and feelings of depression. Since nothing else is different_ I suspect the Lunesta.  I am going to talk to my doctor about tapering off to see.,F,37,30  days,8/25/2009,Lunesta

I'm not pushing Lunesta but 3mg does the best job of getting ME to sleep with minimal side effects. BUT: if I take it more than 3 nights in a row_ the first night off I will have panic attacks on trying to fall asleep. The next night is fine. Don't know if it's Lunesta withdrawal but it could be.

I had never had such a good night's sleep. Kept taking it daily (admittedly against my MD's advice)_ built up a tolerance until I was taking 6 mg per day on a daily basis. Felt generally worse over time physically but was at least able to get to sleep and stay that way. Became very depressed and anxious_ lost 20 pounds in two months.

194, 4, trouble falling asleep,depression_ anxiety and feelings of anger,I have been very happy with Lunesta and never have had a problem with depression_ anger or much anxiety but the last week it has been overwhelming to the point of being scary. I used to think when I read about meds causing depression that the people had to have something deep seated in their psyche for this to happen. Well_ I have changed my mind. I have been taking it every night for about 6 months so think that I will try and take only when I have something important planned for the next day and see if this depression lifts. I have nothing to feel depressed about so I have to believe it is the med and the anger thing is just not me. Not sure what I will use for the other nights but will try Neurontin or a light Xanax. I go to a sleep neurologist and Lunesta has been the only thing that works most. Maybe will have to lower to 2mg next time and see if that avoids the side effects.,F,72,6  months,7/22/2009Email,Lunesta

I'm usually up 4 or 5 times a night_ so this was a treat. However_ the bitter taste started the morning after and lasted about 36 hours. The intensity of the bad taste diminished over the 36 hours. Drinking water caused the worst taste_ most food disguised the taste somewhat. Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi was the only thing I could drink that tasted right. I will take this again only if I am having extreme difficulties falling asleep. The bad taste was intense and almost a show stopper.,M,58,1  days,7/20/2009,Lunesta

198, 5, waking up not getting a good REM,Yes_ it sometimes leaves a bitter taste in your mouth_ but paaaalease_ get over it -- just brush your teeth and/or use Listerine -- isn't that a mighty small price to pay for a good night's sleep. I wouldn't normally mention such a small side effect such as this_ but so many people here are whining about it_ I just had to say this to put it into perspective...,"All I can say is_ ""Better living through chemistry"" folks... When I first started taking it_ I would wake up in the middle of the night and then couldn't get back to sleep_ then I found the answer! For me the catalyst that makes this little luna moth pill work for me is to chug it with a beer. Yes_ that's right_ I pop it with a 12oz bottle of lite beer (or a glass or two of wine) and sleep through the night_ and if I should happen to wake up_ I can get back to sleep within 15 minutes. Don't be afraid to take this little blue with alcohol -- you're going to bed aren't you? Or are you planning on operating machinery? Come on_ grow up and try it with a glass of wine_ beer_ liquor_ your choice... I'm now splitting them in half and they still work great (as long as I use a chaser!) Try it!

200, 3, Insomnia,bitter taste in mouth_ low energy,"overall i have to say that lunesta has the least amount of side effects. I have taken a variety of medication for insomnia and this one had been the best in terms of not feeling hungover or drowsy the next morning. when it works it works good_ but unfortunately the effect of this drug seams to be hit or miss. sometimes it just doesnt work at all. Also it doesn't provide you with a ""deep"" sleep_ and as a result you wake up feeling lethargic. For me i have to have a complety empty somtach for it to work. ( My doctor told me not to eat an hour before taking the medication..but for me i had to to fast for like at least 3 hours before) in summation its an OK medication for sleeping but it may be too ""light"" in terms of getting you to sleep",M,24,3  months,7/10/2009,Lunesta

204, 5, Insomnia,Mild copper taste_ not too bad. Never bothered me once I woke up_ only right before sleeping.,I took this medication for about 2 years before my insurance company made me try Ambien (which gave me a lot of bad side effects). I stopped taking Lunesta for a while. I noticed some mild trembling in my hands and just felt a little odd for one night. I took a Clonazepam 1mg that night and was fine. Since Lunesta is sort of similar to benzos in makeup (but not addictive)_ that made sense to me. I didn't have that problem again.

212, 5, Insomnia,Metallic taste in mouth.  Dizziness if I stay up more than 15 minutes after taking.,"Lunesta has been wonderful for me thus far.  I've taken Ambien_ Ambien CR_ and Restoril on and off for the past few years for chronic insomnia.  Ambien was losing its effectiveness and Restoril took too long to ""kick in"" (it took an average of 2 hours to fall asleep).  I was hesitant about the Lunesta given so many poor ratings.  But_ it's been fantastic.  Yes_ it does leave a fairly strong metallic taste in my mouth_ but I can live with that (brushing your teeth does help with that taste).  I am asleep within 15-20 minutes of taking it and have been able to stay asleep for 8+ hours.  If I do happen to wake up during the night or earler than I want_ I am able to go right back to sleep_ which was not possible with Ambien.  It is important to go straight to bed after taking it though.  The few times I was not able to go straight to bed (an unexpected phone call_ etc)_ it did make me quite dizzy.  But_ that is understandable.  I am very pleased with Lunesta and happy to be getting a good night's sleep again.",F,43,2  weeks,5/20/2009,Lunesta

216, 4, insomnia,Rotten taste in mouth next day.,I have taken Lunesta 3mg on and off since 2007. It is a good medicine for me. I have posted previously and blamed Lunesta for moodiness and irritability_ also anxiety. Turns out these were probably caused by other meds taken at the time. (For example_ 200 mg Ibuprofen!) So now_ I must post and say the only ill effect I have had is the bad taste in mouth. For a good night's sleep this is tiny price to pay. BUT: I have tried never to take the drug more than 5-7 nights in a row. Also find it will not work if I have eaten anything fatty or greasy within 5 hours of taking it. Fat in the bloodstream really cuts down on its efficiency. To sum up: I can get at least 5 hours of good sleep with Lunesta_ with real REM sleep and normal dreams_ and minimal side effects. This cuts down on my chronic arthritis pain because I am rested.For me_ it's a good medicine. Too bad though_ now I have to pay to sleep (it isn't cheap).,F,54,2  years,4/25/2009,Lunesta

Tried 30 mg's of Melatonin _ didn't work.Went to the doctor _ tired Ambien CR _ didn't phase me.Went to a Sleep Neurologist and she gave me a hand full of LUNESTA and said give them a try.I took one 15 minutes before bed.I was asleep within one hour.No scarey dreams.Got 6 hours sleep.   Wow _ that was nice !But from what I read here _ this medication is wicked and should not be used.I have only been one this 1 night.So can't judge if it is hazzardous or not.I am so tired and desperate to sleep.And so far _ this stuff really works.But for how long ?Very frustrating.,F,51,1  days,4/23/2009,Lunesta
218, 3, Sleeping Problems for Years,Bad taste in mouth_ unexplained weigh gain_seems to make me irritable at times,I haven't slept right for a good number of yrs. Finally tired of not sleeping_ so ask Dr to prescribe meds.  First he gave me restoril.  Bad!  Sleep for 2 hrs then up 2 hrs.  I didn't get any descent sleep.  He then prescribed Lunesta.  I took the pill (2mg) for the 1st time and thought I was in hog heaven.  Slept all night and was easy to get up the next morning. I have been taking on average 10 pills a month when need.  I've been doing this for apprx 6 months.  It now seems within the last month_ I can only take one pill a week to get any rest as taking more consecutively will just give me wild dreams and restless night.  I've taken a pill tonight (same 2mg) and here it is now 2 1/2 hrs later and I'm still awake.  UGH!  Back to the drawing board for me.  Also_ over this same time period I have gained 7.5 lbs.  My eating habits have not changed nor my excerise routine.  Doc has no explanation for weight gain.,F,55,6  months,4/20/2009,Lunesta
219, 1, couldn't fall/stay asleep,memory loss_ sleep walking and sleep driving after taking lunesta_ ambien_ ambiem CR and restoril. After consulting the prescribing Dr._ she had me try rozerem and it is awesome. It has melatonin in it which is a natural sleep aid and I never had any weird side effects as mentioned above and my memory is getting sharper. Only problem_ my new insurance company won't cover it and cash price is $168 for 30 pills. So_ I went to the vitamin section of the store and bought natural melatonin for about $7 for 60 3mg pills. Pharmacist said that it may work but it won't have all the chemicals in it that rozerem has in it but thought it wouldn't hurt to try. I took two 3mg pills and had a great nights sleep and woke up feeling refreshed. I'm usually not a huge believer in natural remedies and I know it was only one night I tried it_ but I'm very hopeful now. If this doesn't work and I can't get my insurance co. to cover it_ I will just pay the $168 for the rozerem. I will not use medicine that pu,Another clue to those not having success with sleep aids_ my Dr. told me and there is info. on each of these drugs that if you take it too close to having just eaten a fatty meal_ it can screw up how it works_ so try taking it at least a few hours after you eat.

220, 5, poor sleep,none except a little sleepiness in the morning if I had drank alcohol with it,I don't understand the posts on this website. Lunesta is hands down a life saver. I do not take it every night because of the possibility of dependence_ but if I had a bad night's sleep_ the next night I will take it to catch up_ and it always works perfectly. I sleep unbelievably well with it. Sorry_ but I love this drug_ but then again_ I don't abuse it or take it every day.,F,44,1  years,4/9/2009,Lunesta
221, 4, Insomnia,I have taken Lunesta for over 3 years.  For over 15 years I had problems falling asleep and staying asleep.  With Lunesta I can fall asleep and usually do not wake up during the night.  I taste was bad a first but that does go away.  If you break them in half and try to take it than the taste will be in your mouth all night.  I would not recommend that.  I love taking Lunesta it is the best thing I have taken and it really works for me.  I am not too sure about how long I am able to stay on this without being addicted.  But some days I do not take it (if I dont have to get up early the next day) and I dont have any side effects or withdrawals.  The only thing is with my insurance it is still $35.00 a month.  I hope they make a generic soon.,,F,31,3  years,4/8/2009,Lunesta

But maybe it was because I kept having to get up to urinate! It felt like a diuretic and made me dehydrated. It also created an awful taste in my mouth_ which didn't go away even after brushing my teeth. It made me drowsy_ but I couldn't fall asleep. Once I did finally overdose on the medication and there wasn't anything left in my bladder_ I did sleep great and woke up feeling good. But_ 4 hours to finally get to that point just wasn't worth it! I was on Ambien CR_ which works really well for me_ but the company I work for decided to change health insurance. New insurance requires me to take at least a month of generic Ambien and a month of Lunesta before they will pay for Ambien CR because Lunesta is their ""preferred brand"" (I HATE insurance companies!)",F,23,1  days,4/7/2009,Lunesta

While I found it does help me sleep much_ much better than Ambien_ a few weeks ago I discovered it was the cause of the depression that seemed to come from nowhere. As soon as I stopped taking it the depression disappeared. Was formerly on the 3mg dose--the 3mg made me feel snappy and aggressive_ and then the 2mg made me almost suicidal. I would warn anybody else with a history or a tendency towards depression to be very careful & observant on this drug.,F,,1  years,4/2/2009,Lunesta
225, 1, Insomnia,Woke up after 2 hours and fell in and out of sleep for the next five hours_ I was awake for up to two hours - horrible taste_ HORRIBLE...,I took Lunesta for the first time night before last and immediately had a horrible taste in my mouth.  Thinking that I let it linger on the tongue for a moment too long_ I wrote the bad taste off.  I went to sleep around 10:30 PM and was awake at 12:30 AM - and I mean wide awake.  I used an aromatherapy inhaler a few times that night but drifted in and out of sleep until 5:30 AM.  The taste in my mouth lingered almost the entire day.  I tried Lunesta again last night and had the same sleep deprivation issue and the same horrible somewhat metallic taste in my mouth all day.  It's 6:00 PM and the taste is still there.  I've brushed and rinsed three times today and I can still taste it.  I'm a chef so interference with taste is a HUGE deal breaker.  I'm never taking this again.  No sleep and the horrible taste are too much to deal with.  I'm going back to Ambien.  I can get at least 5 hours of sleep with Ambien - not really enough_ but better than Lunesta,F,41,2  days,3/27/2009,Lunesta

He prescribed Lunesta and provided samples.  Before I filled the prescription I looked for r/w experiences and was very concerned by all the adverse feedback.But after another week of poor sleep_ I broke down and took one. I feared nightmares_ sleepwalking_ a rancid taste in my mouth for a week.Instead I got a full night of deep sleep.  There was a mild metallic taste in my mouth the next morning. But it was gone after the morning brush and rinse.I know drugs effect people differently_ but it did exactly what I needed it to do with no side effects for me.  I only take it every few days.

While they all had their own pros and cons_ Ambien Cr seemed to work best for me until I had an incident of sleep driving which resulted in an accident.  At that point_ I stopped all sleep medications.  But after 6 months of limited sleep at best_ I knew I needed to try something else.  Dr. prescribed Lunesta 3mg.

I have no complaints_ only one concern and that's with the alcohol - I didn't notice it myself_ but others have said that using Lunesta ups alcohol cravings and usage. I drink moderately - I'm the 1-2 glasses of wine a day person and don't want to lose control of that. Will watch that but otherwise_ Lunesta's working. BTW - I tried Trazadone first for sleep issues and felt like a zombie 10 minutes after taking it every time - Lunesta just makes you feel sleepy - you know_ like the Mr. Sandman had visted as my Mom used to say... good luck all.,F,40,2  weeks,3/1/2009,Lunesta

My doctor put me on ambien which really helped me fall asleep_ but I would still wake up in the early morning hours_ unable to go back to sleep. The doc changed me to Lunesta and I slept all night! It has been years since I have slept through the whole night! I did feel a bit groggy upon waking this morning_ but then again_ I always do.

When I skipped a dose last night it went away almost completely. All this time I thought it was allergies_ and I'm annoyed I never figured this out until now (Google ""Lunesta"" and ""mucus"" and you'll see it's happened to others). My only other issue with it was at the highest dose_ which turned out to be too much for me: it didn't wear off well in the morning_ and it seemed to cause some weird mood changes_ like making me prone to ""snap"" at people without warning. I have not had that issue with the 2mg pill. It does make your memory a little less sharp at times I think_ but I've made making lists a habit and I figure anything that doesn't make the list probably wasn't that important anyway.

I do not drink alcohol_ so I think the gin must have triggered something in my brain OR the Lunesta must have worn off. Either way_ this drug did not work with my natural brain chemistry.

269, 1, Sleep aid.,Overwhelming anxiety_ depression_ hopelessness and thoughts of committing suicide.  Terrifying dreams.  Loss of memory.  Lingering feelings of dread.   My Story - I am a husband of twenty seven years and father of four.  I have always had a lust for life and a lot of reasons to be happy and thankful.  After the first time I took Lunesta_ the next day I seriously contemplated driving my car off a bridge or driving as fast as I could and smashing into something.  The next day I told off my boss_ never having had words with him before.  I can't believe he didn't fire me on the spot.  That night I told a friend that I didn't want to live anymore and that life isn't worth the struggle.  The only thing that gave me a feeling of comfort was the thought of committing suicide.  I made a plan that the next day I would act sick and stay home from work.  I would then write my wife and kids a letter explaining how I am better off now and how they are better off without me.  I would also call the co,and the next morning I decided to think about other ways of doing myself in.  I went to work late and told my boss that I was not happy with my job and I might look for other opportunities.  He turned white and the confusion on his face was painful.  I felt a little better that night and decided to put off the suicidal plans for now.  Again I didn't take my pill before bed and the next day I felt a little better still although I was very spooked by the previous two days.  I apologized to my boss and told him I think it might have been the Lunesta_ although I had never heard of such deadly side effects.  I searched the internet that day and found that I was far from alone.  In fact_ others had seen it through and actually killed themselves.  One was a twelve year old boy who had never shown any signs of depression prior to taking Lunesta.  I wish I could scream out to the world NEVER TAKE LUNESTA!!!!

Don't believe the hype -- lunesta is addictive_ you will develop a tolerance to it_ and when you stop taking it you will have rebound insomnia. I suggest weaning yourself off it (get a pill cutter) or temporarily switching to a long half life benzo like valium and weaning yourself of that if lunesta has stopped being affective but you get horrible rebound isomnia when you stop taking it.,M,41,1  years,7/17/2008,Lunesta

It felt as though a fiery golf ball had lodged in my esophagus and would not go either up or down.  The last occasion I vomited a mucus-like substance.Being 70 years old_ in excellent health_ and not using any other medications_ I decided the Lunesta must be the cause of these symptoms and discontinued its use.

I started thinking I might not ever recover my sense of taste.  I had no idea what was going on.  My pharmacist knew what it was immediately however.  How come my doctor thought this drug had no side effects? I finally got rid of the problem by stopping the medication and after four days I got my life back again.  You don't know how much you depend on taste for enjoyment of life until you lose it.",M,67,14  days,4/14/2008Email,Lunesta
316, 5, Difficulty staying asleep,I woke up with the much described bad taste in my mouth_ but after a drink of water or coffee it went away.  I have noticed that the longer I take Lunesta the less odten I notice this side-effect.  I have amazing and vivid dreams when I withdraw from Lunesta for one to two nights; if I go off for two or three nights I feel dizzy and I have a rebound night of extremely poor sleep.,I tried Ambien CR and Rozeram.  Both got me to sleep_ but I continued to wake up multi0ple times a night.  Lunesta is the first medication I have taken that helps me sleep through the night.  Even when I do wake up_ I am able to roll over and fall back to sleep.  (Without sleep aids_ I wake up and then my mind engages with thoughts of work_ which then keeps me awake.)  I am concerned that a lot of the postings on this site are histrionic and some of the the side-effects cited are not related to the drug.,F,49,2  years,4/13/2008,Lunesta
317, 1, Insomnia,I had a side affect I really didn't expect about 15 minutes after taking the drug I had a pounding heart rate like I had been on the treadmill for 15 minutes ... scary,I would say be careful because that fast heart rate is the opposite affect I thought I was gonna have .... sure it made me tired after about 30 minutes or so but it was like a stimulant when it first kicked in ....  has anyone else had there heart rate increase from this drug? the day after I still feel groggy and I have a bad taste in my mouth when drinking water ... be careful with this drug people .... that was my last pill of Lunesta thats for sure ....,M,39,1  days,4/13/2008Email,Lunesta
318, 2, Insomnia due to depression,The metal taste in the mouth is awful. What's strange is the taste isn't there unless I drink something.  Slight headache.,It did help me fall asleep quickly_ but I still woke during the night_ after a HORRIBLE nightmare.  When I woke I had the worst headache.  I will try one more night_ but if it doesn't work better in helping me sleep I'm stopping it.  I'll ask for Vistaril or just take some Benadryl instead.,F,43,1  days,4/11/2008,Lunesta

322, 1, Insomnia,Worse insomnia_ anxiety_ anger_ hallucinations at night,I began this with trial samples given out by my doctor. The negative effects on my mental state were so severe it scared me. At the time there was no info on the web about this_ but I now know that I am not the only one to experience this_ which has given me some comfort. I just hope doctors prepare their patients for this rare but real side effect. If I had continued to use the drug for much longer I probably would have checked myself into a mental hospital. As soon as I stopped taking it I was fine. Well_ I still had insomnia. I am now on Rozerem and it is great for me.,F,34,4  days,3/27/2008,Lunesta

324, 1, I could not get a good nights sleep,I took lunesta for three months and had a real bad taste in my mouth. So I decided not to take it_ and after one month of not taking it I still have the bad taste in my mouth. It is still not out of my system. I have bad mood swings and feel this drug is not for everyone. I was never moody before taking Lunesta I feel it is a mind altering drug with serious side effects.,I feel that Lunesta should be studied further before giving to every patient. I am 64 and never had the side effects that I have experienced with this drug. Bad taste_ and very moody and angry. This drug is not for everyone.,F,64,3  months,3/24/2008,Lunesta

Did keep me asleep during the night.  Besides the bad taste in my mouth the next day_ the biggest issue had to do with how irritable I became.  I was prone to fits of rage and wanted to kick people.  Working in a cubicle environment became almost unbearable.  I had to stop taking Lunesta because I was afraid I was going to be fired for my outbursts of anger.,F,31,2  weeks,3/21/2008,Lunesta
327, 3, insomnia due to depression/anxiety.,bad taste_ but mostly that just happened when i was drinking or eating after taking it.  works best if you take it on an empty stomach and drink something carbonated.  the only problems i had were_ sometimes i would be tired but not want to lay down and i'd teeter around the house like i was drunk and clean or play on the computer.  or i wouldn't be able to fall asleep and i'd get really mean.  i've been taking 3mg of lunesta for about 6 months and it has stopped working as well_ so i am up to 6mg which works better_ i still have trouble actually falling asleep_ but once i am asleep i stay asleep.  and i don't wake up groggy_ once i'm awake for the day i'm happy and ready to go.,doesn't come in generic form_ so i have to pay the full $30 for my insurance copay.,M,28,6  months,3/20/2008Email,Lunesta

330, 1, Insomnia,Thoughts of suicide_ anxiety,I took Lunesta for my insomnia for about 4 weeks before realizing I wasn't myself.  I never had depression problems until I started taking it.  I would cry for hours for no reason and couldn't get myself to stop.  I would find myself thinking about suicide at least 3 times a day. I finally got off it and now I'm on Trazadone but my depression hasn't seemed to go away.  DO NOT TAKE LUNESTA!  You're better off taking Ambien if you don't mind hallucinating in the middle of the night.,F,24,4  weeks,3/14/2008,Lunesta
331, 5, Green hand syndrome,I have also had Green Hand Syndrome problems but I am not gay_ which may or may not have been proven effective through a triple blind placebo fest.  One side affect I have noticed is that the drug seems to cause drowsiness.  This can be combated with a combination of strong coffee and vigorous dancing.  Seems to make me drowsier while under the influence of sloppiness.  After taking 30 mgs_ noticed metallic taste in mouth and strong desire to sleep.  Still not gay but weirder things have happened.

Imagine my dismay when this s*** didn't work and I had a horrible taste in my mouth the next day that made drinking water taste like battery acid.   It was horrible. I was told there were no side effects of daytime drowsiness or depression like with ambien_ but that was false. I'm upset.,F,27,3  days,2/29/2008,Lunesta
339, 4, Insomnia induced by mania,Metallic aftertaste that lasted for about most of the next day and a film stayed in my mouth the next day.  The aftertaste is in my mouth not on my tongue_ which is interesting.Dreams are very vivid.  If they are realistic in nature_ it is hard to separate them from reality.,I've always preferred Ambien and lately Ambien CR but with my other medications they stopped helping my sleep latency.  Sonata seemed to delay onset of my sleep_ so my psychiatrist prescribed Lunesta.  The aftertaste is bothersome and not pleasant but worth it.  My sleep latency decreased dramatically...  down to under a half hour after taking the 3mg.  What is nice about Lunesta is that if you wake up (or are woken up) it is easy to get up and function and then go back to sleep.Hallucinations seem to happen if I take it and don't attempt to sleep -- so it is not something I would recommend taking until you are ready for sleep onset.  Remember_ while reading these forums_ a lot of the people seeking message boards to post have bad experiences while people with good experiences are just happy and don't seek out a way to vent.  Clinical trials report the metallic taste only occurs in 31% of people and that it is not a serious side effect.  If it helps you sleep_ and nothing else,M,31,5  weeks,2/23/2008Email,Lunesta

341, 5, chronic insomnia,UNBELIEVABLE---It does help me sleep_ if I go to bed right away. HOWEVER_ if I stay up my brain functions so differently it's freaky! I am able to remember German words that I haven't studied in 10 years_ I can play complicated piano pieces that I had forgotten and can't play if I'm not on Lunesta_ and my creativity is heightened. I spend hours designing amazing clothes_ painting_ creating WILD and very weird art---and I even become fascinated with science_ which I am normally not very interested in. I read every single one of the accounts on this website and no one has described this type of reaction_ so this seems even stranger now.,Lunesta is apparently the gateway to my creativity. It's like my brain is on steroids and I just want to learn and create. I'm able to figure things out that I have never been able to figure out before---some of them mathematical_ some sociological_ and some are just life skills that I had not aquired until now. FASCINATING. I LOVE it_ but the temptation to stay awake sort of defeats the purpose of taking a sleeping pill.

Though now being a week into it_ I find myself jittery after taking it and I think even more depressed. I don't have the motivation to do anything. Also_ tonight I jogged and I was unable to run for my normal amount of time. I felt exasperated. Has anyone else experienced rapid increase of heart rate as well as slight unmotivation?

The problem is that it made me so depressed_ anxious an had feelings of hopelessness.  My family asked me to seek help for depression. I raged at them. No control over emotions. This drug should be taken off the market. I years to come_ I am certain that they will find Lunesta has caused many suicides. It took me 2 weeks to withdraw from this drug. I feel better now than I have in years. I still cannot sleep_ but a small price to pay compared to the hopeless feelings and anxiety.

349, 1, Too anxious to sleep,memory loss_ depression_ confusion_ suicidal thoughts,This medication works great. It is the most consistent 6-7 hrs. of sleep I've ever had. It doesn't seem to work for me on a full stomach though. Sometimes when I'm just laying in bed crying and wanting to kill myself I just pop another 3mg and I'm usually right to sleep. Thank god I've found this website. I have suffered from depression and anxiety and just thought my other medications stopped working. Now I know I'm not the only one.

If anything_ I have the relief from no longer being exhausted all the time because of lack of sleep.,I have been taking Lunesta for about 2 years. Started at 2mg and then went to 3 mg. Am now back down to 2 mg. It works for me_ although there have been times that I still did not feel well during the day_ because I had not slept well.

No caffeine_ soothing bath_ no light_ perfect temp_ perfect bed_ no noise_ etc which I generally can create. I can still wake up at 3 to 4 am and be extremely aware of surroundings and have to meditate on going back to sleep and not start troubleshooting the upcoming week. Honestly_ I hate grogginess and that is what Rozeram does to me_ and Ambien/CR doesnt even help me sleep.  I count Lunesta as a blessing as I have been taking it for over a year or two.

A night like this starts out with me going to bed and taking Lunesta about 10:30pm_ and at 3 or 4am I am still not asleep.

The last time_ I seemed to take it and within a 1/2 hour I was rolling over to go to sleep_ but with my present script (which is almost ready for a refill) I have been in this state where I can't fall asleep for hours.

I noticed a foul taste in my mouth but being half asleep (and possibly dazed from the drug)_ I figured it was just morning mouth or something.  When I woke up a few hours later the taste was still there.  It got worse through the rest the of the morning_ and by early afternoon it was so bad I began to feel a bit ill.  I'm a big water drinker.. while drinking water while experiencing this side effect_ I likened the taste to drinking liquid copper.  Absolutely horrible.. After some investigation (and one more chance the next night)_ I discovered may other people went through similar side effects.  I destroyed the remainder of my prescrption_ and have been using Ambien (10mg) for over a week now with NO problems whatsoever.,M,39,2  days,12/7/2007,Lunesta
371, 4, Chronic Insomnia,Slightly tired the next day but I expected that. I have no issue with bad taste in my mouth as others descibed. I did have to half the dose from 3 mg.  Itworked much better.  I also still have to take xanax with get my mind to shut down due to Adult ADD butI sleep well on small doses of each.,I was reading about another sleep medication in this forum and started to get freaked.   I decided to look up Lunesta as I have been taking it for 2 years.  After reading the forum I suggest everyone try there medication no matter what this says.  We apparently area all AMAZINGLY different in body chemistry.,F,45,2  years,12/6/2007,Lunesta
372, 1, insomnia,Just realizing this_ but severe depression at times - so severe I thought I'd be better off dead although I didn't actually think about suicide itself_ heightened anxiety_ constant burning behind and in both of my eyes_ swollen eyes just like someone else said_ incessant fogginess_ irritable_ agitated.,I started taking this medication back in May_ my primary care gave me some samples and a script for mg of Lunesta after I'd been taking Ambien for almost a year and it stopped working. Well_ I kept waking up at night. So I tried the Lunesta and it worked much better than the Ambien. So I took all the samples and filled the script. My father had passed away in February and in early June I was feeling extremely depressed about his death and then_ my life in general - though I am happily married with two very young children who I love dearly. I would cry on and off all day long and was feeling hopeless. I thought I would be better off dead so I would not feel so hopeless anymore. I even went on Lexapro for a month because of it! I stopped Lunesta 3 days ago and feel like a new person.,F,39, ,12/5/2007,Lunesta
373, 2, chronic insomnia,The metallic taste initially.  I started to suffer anxiety attacks which I NEVER had before.  Also dizziness the next day with palpitions which I attributed to the anxiety.  Increasse emotional sensitivity.  Too easily moved to tears or laughing a little more than seems appropriate to the situation.  Very mild_ but noticeble confusion the next day as well.,I have tried this for two years because Ambien stopped being effective. Since I won't take sleep meds on a regular basis I didn't connect the side effects to the drug until a few months ago.  I then started to keep notes to see if how I was feeling was related to Lunesta and it has proved to me that it has.  I am now going to ask my doctor to switch me back to Ambien after two years I think it may start to work again.  Otherwise_ I will just stay awake because I refuse to take Lunesta again.  Five hours of sleep is not worth the aggravation that it brings.,F,55,2  years,12/4/2007,Lunesta
374, 1, sleep deprivation due to stress,Received this prescription from my Primary Doctor last Thursday (November 29_ 2007) the mettalic taste!!!   I thought it was just me and this website is a GOD SEND.  I_ too_ had very vivid nightmares_ one was a green frog levitating on my ceiling.  Also I LOVE water_ need water (very very prone to kidney stones)....water tastes like IRON now.  Even Sierra Mist_ Slurpees_ Milkshakes_ nothing has gotten rid of the taste! I find myself getting choked up_ lump in my throat talking about tv shows or news events (I am not usually that sensitive!) I'm calling my Primary doctor in the MORNING! Thank you...all of you SERIOUSLY!  Taking this for sleep issues is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT!,,F,34,4  days,12/4/2007Email,Lunesta

376, 1, Insomnia,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!  I take Lexapro and have suffered from depression and anxiety during my life.  Within a day of taking_ I noticed incredible aggression and RAGE.  I also felt completely hopeless and had brief suicidal thoughts and ideation.,I had taken Diphenhydramine (simply sleep) for months to help me sleep and then decided to call my GYN for something stronger.  Aside from the foul/bitter taste_ I seemed to relax quickly.  However_ the violent_ nasty_ bitchy person I became was embarrassing.  I ruined my Thanksgiving for my entire family with a complete panic attack and meltdown.  Butterflies in the ad?  Hardly!  Shame on me for falling for the false and misleading ad.  I am relieved by reading others' stories.  I thought I was going insane!,F,39,7  days,11/27/2007,Lunesta
377, 5, insomnia/hot flashes,Nasty metal taste,"I started taking Lunesta because I cannot take anything else for menopause and the hot flashes were waking/keeping me awake at night.  Lunesta helps me to go to sleep and stay asleep.  If I have a hot flash that wakens me_ I take a melatonin to ""aide"" the Lunesta and I go back to sleep.  I am very pleased with this combination_ and I'm thrilled that I can finally sleep with all these hot flashes.",F,48,4  months,11/26/2007,Lunesta

She found me in our pantry_ looking for food_ and handed me the phone.  I proceeded to have a conversation with a work associate_ and handed the phone back to to my wife.  The next morning_ my work associate mentioned our phone conversation; I had absolutely no recollection of it_ and called my wife_ who told me what had happened; she did not realize I was asleep!  Needless to say_ I quit taking Lunesta_ and have gone back to taking 2 benadryl tablets before bed_ which seems to be working OK.,,M,55,21  days,11/26/2007,Lunesta

380, 4, Trouble staying asleep,Lunesta helps me to fall asleep and I can sleep 6-7 hrs without waking up. No side effects noted over the past 7 days that I've tried this medication. I had trouble falling to sleep and staying asleep. Before trying Lunesta samples_ I was taking Benadryl tablets as a sleep aid.,Have been taking 37 mg Benadryl which helped me to fall asleep but I would wake up 3 -5 times per night over 6 hours sleep. The side effects of Benadryl are frequent urination and dry mouth. With Lunesta_ there was no urge to go to the bathroom a couple of times per night compared to Benadryl and dry mouth was minimal.,M,52,7  days,11/24/2007Email,Lunesta
381, 3, insomnia,Horrible metallic taste- especially if you split the pills. Occasional mild headaches_ Memory problems and the feeling of not thinking clearly_ caused me to panic while driving etc. I am trying to get off this drug as it is addicting_ and the long-term side effects are not worth it. My doctor told me if I keep taking this I will have Alzheimer's by the time I am 50.,It was wonderful for sleep for the first few months. After a year on it_ it does not work as well and I take a much smaller dose along with ativan to help me fall asleep. It does not help me to stay asleep for 8 hours the way it initially did.,F,31,1.5  years,11/24/2007,Lunesta
382, 4, insomnia,A taste in the mouth that is bitter and offensive_ but bearable. Bloating in the face and hands the next day. And I just discovered: this drug makes me irritable_ touchy_ and aggressive the day after taking.,I have a 3mg scrip for this drug_ and take it when I just can't get to sleep. This happens once every few weeks. It puts me to sleep and I stay asleep for a good 6-7 hours_ and wake up slightly drowsy. It does give me needed sleep. The awful taste is not a deterrent_ but the facial edema and terrible irritability are side effects I finally realized were from the Lunesta. The day after a dose I feel like I'm in the throes of PMS_ and am obnoxious and cranky. Two guesses what happens when I take it and already have PMS? This is a drug of last resort for me because I am very leery of the mood changes it causes.,F,53,6  months,11/22/2007,Lunesta

384, 1, insomnia,Hoplessness_ depression_ severe pain on right side of face_ dizzyness_ slight bad taste in mouth.,I was given both 2mg and 3mg Lunesta samples by my Dr. _ Told to start with 2mg_ and switch to the 3mg if I was still having trouble sleeping... well_ it puts me to sleep_ but the side-effects are so horrendous that I vowed to never take Lunesta again. First few nights I got a sharp_ piercing pain in the entire right side of my head_ no OTC painkillers would touch it. Also_ had very disturbing nightmares the first few nights. This went away_ to be replaced by profound depression_ hopelessness... I often have the urge to cry for no reason. I find I am unable or unwilling to do the things I used to love_ it's even hard to be with my family... Reading the other comments here.. Lunesta must do something to a person's mind... I used to take Ambien_ methinks it's time to go back to it....,M,37,17  days,11/21/2007Email,Lunesta
385, 2, Insomnia,Wow! Next day phobias!,"I used to think that phobias were ridiculous. Until I took Lunesta!! Although it did help me sleep_ the next day I experienced phobias -- actual TERROR -- over simple things. Every little sound would make me jump. So jumpy_ in fact_ that I wore earplugs to block the sound. But then_ I started ""seeing"" (imagining) quick movements out of the corner of my eye_ as if there were mice or cockroaches darting past. That was enough!I refuse to take something that messes with my mind the way Lunesta did. Hopefully they'll come up with a better sleep medication someday soon.",F,43,7  days,11/18/2007,Lunesta

Usually got 6 hours of mostly restful sleep_ sometimes with vivid dreams_ which were not bad.  I still felt like I had gotten a good night's sleep_ even with a majority of the stated side effects. Over the 2+ years of taking this medication I noticed on some occasions it did not always work.  A few nights I took it and never went to sleep.  I attributed it to eating too much or eating too late.  Depression set in and seemd to grow worse and worse_ with added anxiety and overall unhappiness.  I eventually attempted SUICIDE_ which I have NEVER before even thought of doing.  I have a good life_ with a few niches_ as everyone has_ but not enough to want to kill myself over.  I know this drug helps in sleeping disorders_ but if you have no good alternative_ PLEASE_ PLEASE monitor yourself with help of a loved one or friend or doctor_ and be very conscience of any change in your feelings,F,55,2  years,11/8/2007,Lunesta
389, 1, chronic insomina_ hard time falling,None,I have been taking ambien for 4 years and eventually the effectiveness wore off. My dr immediately took me off and switched me to Lunesta 3 mg-the highest dosage. The first night was awful_ he didn't tell me about ambien withdrawal. I was up every hour with the worst night mares. The second night was better. Lunesta however is not worth the $45.00 I had to sepnd to get it. It does help relax your mind for a few minutes but that is it. It doesn't help someone fall asleep and that is what I need. I take lamicatal 2x a day and then a sleep medicine. I would not recommend this to anyone it doesn't so anything. Now I have to find something else to sleep.,F,27,14  days,11/7/2007,Lunesta

392, 5, Insomnia,First two days of taking it_ had slight 'buzz' feeling in head. After that_ no side effects,I was real anxious about taking it after reading this board...so first couple of days I did not get good sleep and also had 'buzz' feeling in my head_ but probably due to poor sleep rather than medication. By third night_ I was sleeping fine. I have issues both going to sleep and staying asleep. With Lunesta_ I take it about 30 mins prior to when I should go to sleep as it slowly makes me drowsy. By 30 mins_ I can close my eyes and fall asleep. I usually still wake up during the night (but much less often than the 5 or 6 times I was waking up)_ but I find it easier to go back asleep. I am also now dreaming consistently_ which I have not done in years. One night I had 3 dreams_ which I can't remember doing that since I was a child.I have 0 side effects thus far_ and now have a 6 month prescription for it. I now actually look forward to night time and sleeping where I used to dread it (which compounded the problem).,M,35,45  days,10/29/2007,Lunesta

However_ I cannot even stand myself_ much less anyone else! ANGER bouts to the EXTREME out of nowhere. I'll take the ""morning hangover"" that Benadryl gives me any day over ""another"" divorce!

I wasnt sure what to do first_ ect. I  just walked around at home _ from room to room _ feeling confused  and crying all day . I felt like I was going crazy and it was scary!  I called my Dr and was crying on the phone. My Dr  thought that MAYBE  the Lunesta was causing a bad reaction and she told me to stop taking it to see if I felt any better.  So I stopped taking it and  started feeling better (yeah!). I still wasnt sure the Lunesta was at fault so last night I tried it again. Silly me_ it took awhile to figure out it  IS the Lunesta causing problems. I am having trouble thinking clearly.  I am having trouble remembering.

Jittery and out of it all day long.,I had been taking Lunesta off and on for about a year.  At first it worked okay but eventually the effectiveness wore off and it wasnt' really working at all.  Apparently this drug affects everyone who takes it differently but it should only be taken with caution and stopped with the slightest change in your mood or disposition because it just gets worse and worse when you continue to take it.  I'm throwing away my samples because I don't even want to risk giving them to someone who might have a worse reaction than me.,F,44,1  years,10/19/2007Email,Lunesta

The past few nights (first week taking Lunesta) I have been having crazy nightmares and wake up crying or yelling.  I also noticed that my eyes are swollen like I have been balling for hours.  Maybe I am_ just in my sleep?  I also have a funky taste in my throat and even bottled water tastes toxic.  I also can't get out of my nightmares for a good 5 minutes after I wake up.

I thought it would be horrible but I just have a very slight metallic taste some mornings.  Unless I am thinking about it I don't even notice.  All my food and water taste the same.  2mg only helped me fall asleep.  3mg had me fall asleep pretty quickly and stay asleep for 4-5 hours before waking through the rest of the night.  Some nights I sleep through the whole night.  I haven't yet felt loopy or groggy after taking it.  It seems to be very subtle but fast in putting me to sleep.,F,33,2  weeks,9/27/2007,Lunesta

Slightly bad taste after taking_ thought it was because I cut the pill in half.  Still felt groggy in the morning.  Did not take tonight because I have to work in the morning_ however_ I'm not sleeping at all tonight_ so far.,Only took because my new insurance company refused to give me 1 month supply of Ambien so I ran out and my doctor gave me samples of Lunesta.  Will go back to Ambien if I can afford to pay for it out of pocket.  My doctor is appealing my insurance companies decision not to give me the Ambien.

415, 5, Chronic Inability to Fall Asleep,None,I have only taken Lunesta one night. After reading all the comments on this page about Lunesta_ I have to say I was scared to take it_ but due to not being able to fall asleep_ I went ahead with it. I was totally worried about having a bad taste in my mouth_ so I tried the tips some of the other comments offered. I took a couple good long drinks of water_ then filled my mouth with water and dropped the small pill into the back of my throat and swallowed. I then followed by drinking at least 8 oz. of water_ probably more. Then I brushed my teeth and tongue really well. Then came and got into bed. I was asleep within 10 minutes. I guess I'll see if later uses of Lunesta cause any side effects. I did change from taking my Lexapro (anti-depressant) to the morning to avoid any interactions. So far_ I like Lunesta. (I had been taking Ambien CR and it just wasn't working to help me fall asleep. I had taken Ambien before the CR and it worked GREAT!!!

Ambien put me to sleep ok but I'd wake up 3 or 4 hours later and not be able to go back to sleep and generally felt ""drugged.""  With Lunesta_ I started sleeping longer and was able to get back to sleep pretty quickly even after the typical 4am urination call.  No problem at all with the taste (swallow whole with water).  I do_ however_ feel a little ""out of it"" often in the mornings and am prone to absentminded events (i.e. starting the coffeemaker and forgetting to put the carafe underneath_ forgetting to zip up after using the bathroom and the like).  Made me worry a bit about early onset alheimers but I think it's the lunesta.  The length and quality of sleep is great but it does have side effects.

But I started to notice side effects that weren't really wearing off during the day_ even though the sleepiness effect had worn off. For one thing_ it gave a me a REALLY short fuse. I would snap at my kids before I even knew I was angry_ and this is definitely out of character for me. As soon as I skipped a dose this went away. It also wrecked my memory to the point where I seriously wondered if I was getting early-onset Alzhiemer's or something. I literally could not remember one simple thing from one minute to the next. Lastly_ and this was definitely the most strange side effect of all--it seemed to make my hypoglycemia go totally out of control. Possibly this contributed to the ""short fuse"" thing also_ I don't know. The good news is all of this went away as soon as I stopped...and I am sleeping just fine!

Ambien made me crazy and other drugs left me feeling numb and cloudy the next day.  Lunesta does not make me crazy and it does not wipe my memory.  I take it before bed and am able to lay down and start drifting to sleep.  It helps to slow my thoughts down so I can get some rest.  It is just as effective today as when I first took it.

I've been taking it for about 6 months and have been noticing that I'll be thinking of an idea or something I need to do_ and a minute later can't remember what it was (the most annoying_ recurring one is that half the time_ I forget to zip my pants after using the bathroom). I will also be in conversation with someone and have difficulty remembering a name or a detail. And I don't think it's the onset of Alzheimers. I'm thinking seriously of stopping the Lunesta to see what changes.One more thing: I just read that you're not supposed to cut the tabs in half. I've been doing it for months. Makes the taste worse.

I've always been an insomniac_ but chronic pain put it over the edge and my doctor was adamant about me being able to rest and restore my body at night. Lunesta did just that. It doesn't knock me out like Ambien did. Didn't make me tired past the first night_ now just relaxes me enough to not be scared to try and sleep. Always fall asleep within 10 minutes of crawling into bed.  I've experienced the bad taste in my mouth for the entire 8 months I've been on it_ but I have no issues with it. It is what it is. My breath is awful in the morning however when compared to a night without Lunesta.

On the first night of 3mg dose_ I hallucinated before even passing out. I walked around the house touching things and laid in bed watching the ceiling fan come down on me. It was horrible. The awful taste in my mouth that came on about 5 minutes after taking the pill was one of undescibable nastiness_ and it stayed with me all the next day. I do not reccommend this pill to anyone with sleep problems.,F,30,6  days,7/18/2007,Lunesta

In general_ it's worked very well for a few months now_ but the past two times I've taken it have been followed by a dull headache behind one eye the next day. Too early to say if it's directly related. Further testing is required to assume direct link as I've had headaches like this in the past.

But It's only after I started reading the postings here that I realized the psychological effects.  For the past couple of months_ I don't feel like ""myself"".  I feel sad most of the time_ with no desire to start or finish anything. I often experience a feeling of being in a haze (not in a good way) and weird thoughts with my mind racing.

YUCK!  i fell asleep but only stayed asleep until 3:00am (two nights in a row) but was able to fall right back to sleep after seeing what time it was.  i did wake up with a killer headache today!  hmmmm.  perhaps a shot of whiskey is all i need to help me sleep.  between the taste_ the waking up_ feeling grogged-out in the morning and the headache_ who needs the stuff?  also_ i have unfortunately spent $80 in one week on two meds that don't seem to work.,F,42,2  days,7/8/2007Email,Lunesta

There is no ""drifting"" off to sleep.  The onset of sleep is pretty fast and you may not remember falling to sleep_ or what you were watching on TV.  A bonus to Lunesta is that I get away with only 6 hours of sleep_ although I found 7-8 hours to be ideal.

You actually get the bad taste in your mouth when it kicks in at night_ but the taste lasts the whole next day_ even water tastes bad. It also gave me the most vivid_ horrific nightmares (every single night)_ so I always woke up feeling exhausted.  And some nights it didn't even work_ but it would make you feel comatose anyway_ and you'd just lay half awake all night unable to move.

After 3-4 months of daily use_ I stopped taking Lunesta and did not experience any withdrawal.,It effects different people in different ways. I never got the bad taste in my mouth. It isn't a drug that knocks you out either. It gently brought me to sleep_ and kept me that way for 7-8 hours. I had insomnia related to an antidepressant I had just started on. After 3 or 4 months or taking this drug everyday_ the side effect of insomnia wore off from the antidepressant and I stopped using Lunesta. I did not have any withdrawal problems.

Do I leave food on sitting on stove for over an hour before eating? I answered ""Yes"" to some of the questions. He prescribe Vermox for parasites and nothing crazy happened to me like diarhea_ or constipation or vomiting. I ate washed all our bedding_ clothing and disinfected our couches_ seats and cleaned all bathrooms and he prescribed a pill for all my family members. Guess what I feel better then ever! My son has gained weight and he can focus and my daughter is great as well. I can sleep.

I would think one thing & say or write another that was complete nonsense!  Have taken 3mg. Lunesta for four nights.  No bad taste at all.  Today_ the nausea after lunch was awful - lost everything.  Don't know if this is due to Lunesta or not.  I guess I'll know if it continues.  All in all_ Lunesta is doing its job. I fall asleep within 30 minutes & stay asleep for 8 hours.  No ""hangover"" effect either.",F,64,4  days,6/11/2007,Lunesta
473, 1, insomnia,Oh. My. God.  The taste is vile.  It tastes like you put batteries in your mouth.  (Yes_ I did this once as a little kid.  I never forgot the taste_ and thanks to the taste_ I never put batteries in my mouth again.)  With Lunesta_ not only is the taste alone putrid_ but the taste/smell gets WORSE upon inhaling or exhaling.  Vile stuff.  Just vile.,I rated this med at a 1 because the taste/smell side-effect was SO distrubing and unpleasant that it actually kept me awake.  The first time I took the drug_ I thought something was melting or on fire in my house.  I couldn't place the smell (it was metallic) and I couldn't find the source of the smell.  The second time I took the med_ I *knew* it had to be the pill.  The taste disturbance overrode any sleep properties the pill could give_ so I've ranked Lunesta at a 1.  Remember_ folks: the first rule of medicine is to DO NO HARM.,F,31,2  days,6/8/2007,Lunesta

I cut my 3mg tablet in half most night but I do take a full tablet about twice per week.  For the past couple of months I have been experiencing lack of coordination and a fairly persistent dull_ throbbing headache throughout part of my head and behind the one eye. The headache becomes worse when I bend over or exert myself.I just had a precautionary MRI done to rule out any more serous problems but haven't received the results yet.I am going to start cutting back with the intention of eliminating all sleep aids.,M,,1  years,6/7/2007Email,Lunesta

I did have a slight headache though_ but nothing serious. It helped me sleep throughout the night_ and I didn't feel too groggy the next day. I was pretty impressed_ and I never felt like it ""knocked"" me out the way Benadryl does. Just subtle sleepiness and feeling pretty good the next day. I get an average of 6 solid hours of sleep on this_ while I was only getting 3-4 before. I recommend when the over the counter stuff doesn't work.",F,30,1  weeks,6/3/2007,Lunesta

My sister says when she came into the room_ I jumped and said ""who are you?! where am I?!""_ BUT I HAVE NO MEMORY OF IT. The next day_ at least 14 hours later_ I started to suffer from chest pain_ which made me feel like I was going to suffer from a heart attack. Might be a drug interaction with Lexipro_ as I used to take Lunesta while I was on Zoloft_ and while I did not suffer from chest pain then_ I still the bitter metal after taste_ though the hallucinations were there_ but not as vivid.",F,20,7  days,5/29/2007,Lunesta

479, 5, insomnia from valium withdrawal,Just a very slight bitter taste in morning_ no worse than the taste of coffee.,This drug kept me from going off my rocker during my withdrawal from 10 mg of Valium a day. About 5 days after my last milligram of Valium_ my sleep had deteriorated to shallow_ broken stretches with anxiety and frightening images. My doctor prescribed 3 mg Lunesta prn for sleep. It knocked me out instantly_ blanking out the anxiety and creepy images from the Valium withdrawal. I slept from 11:30 pm to 4 am_ then from 4 to 6 am_ and got up rested. This is a miracle for me. I have never slept well_ and this is as good as it gets. Normal dreams_ nothing at all like being knocked out by Valium itself. This is after only 1 dose_ so I may come back in 2 weeks with other side effects to report. But this can help you get off Valium_ Ambien and other addictive drugs.,F,52,1  days,5/22/2007,Lunesta
480, 3, Insomnia,Lunesta gave me a very bad taste.  It was especially noticable if I took a drink of water. If I took a Lunesta at 11:00 pm_ I would still have the taste in my mouth at noon the next day. Lunesta made me feel mentally slow all morning long.,I think Lunesta helped me sleep_ but Ambien was more effective in helping me fall asleep. I prefer regular Ambien compared with the extended release kind because it wears off faster (even if I wake up too early) because Ambien and Lunesta both make me mentally slow.,M,41,30  days,5/21/2007,Lunesta

I also felt very groggy the next day but I tried it for 5 nights just to make sure it wasn't a freakish thing.  I EXPERIENCED THESE ISSUES EVERY NIGHT!!!  I researched it and found that 34% of people will get the bad taste and that sleeping pills should not stay in your system as long as LUNESTA does.  I switched to AMBIEN CR and it has made a HUGE difference- GREAT MED!!!!,Would not take myself as a 35 year old active man knowing the side effects (bad taste_ groggy in the AM).

I have resorted to saltine crackers. If I wanted to experience morning sickness_ I would have gotten pregant. I will ask for another sleep aid when this rx runs out (if I can make it that long).

I woke up feeling extremely ill with the most horrible taste in my throat and extremely nauseas. I am at work feeling like crap and have thrown up a couple of times already.

500, 3, Insomnia...of course.   What else?,I didn't experience the taste or anything.  No headaches...etc...may have exaggerated morning grogginess.It seems that once every few nights with this medication (especially the first night you take it after missing a dose) you will experience a very restless night with little sleep_ short dream fragments (usually of an unpleasant nature) and a generally groggy awareness through the night that you are not getting the sleep you need for the next day.,My insominia mainly occurs in an inability to get to sleep.  Such an inability that even 10-15 milligrams of Ambien would take anywhere from 2-4 hours to work (whereas usually for most sleep aids_ people fall asleep fairly quickly).  Also_ before I started on sleep aids_ when I could sleep_ my sleep was very thin_ with lots of very short dream fragments_ with little to no deep or restorative sleep. Unfortunately_ Ambien (which I used to take) would occasionally result in abnormally long sleep times (like 12-14 hours).  Oddly enough_ this is happening even more with Lunesta.  Does this happen to anyone else?  Ig takes forever to work for me_ and then when it does_ I sleep to long.  It is as if once it is in my system_ my system cannot work the medication out (which is great for 8 hours or so_ but 14????).

I do find that I am a bit groggy the rest of the next day_ and that I am also a little bit cranky.  I could use a nap right now.,Its funny to read all the negative comments about the bad taste.  Sure its a bad taste_ but I am betting that most of these people have not awaken in the middle of the night with a mouthful of stomach bile (I also have GERD) and that is exactly what it tastes like.  I have often awaken in the morning with that same exact taste in my mouth_ even before I started taking Lunesta.  Be grateful that you don't have that.  There are plenty of options out there_ excercise them.  I take it on a as needed basis.  I have about 10 samples from my Doc_ and when I go back in April_ I will ask for a prescription.

525, 1, wanted non-interrupted sleep,Everything tasted different_ even water. it may have caused me to be depressed. I am now taking anti-depressants because of how I feel. I am also on withdrawal from Lunesta after taking for about a month. Withdrawal includes nervousness_ panic feelings when I think about normal problems and difficulty in doing my work_ even going to work.  I am hoping withdrawal ends soon (have been off for about 5 days).,It did not help me fall asleep. I could take it and be awake for 3 or 4 hours. However_ once asleep_ for about 3 or 4 days  I slept about 5 hours_ as I continued to use_ my sleep pattern was back to 3 to 4 hours then awake and asleep awake and asleep.

The terrible taste in my mouth never goes away!Everything tastes different or nasty. On many nights it still takes me a long time to get to sleep and I'm still sleepy in the mornings.

527, 1, Insomnia,WARNING FOR THE ELDERLY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS:  My mother was prescribed Lunesta for insomnia. She is in her early seventies_ no other health problems at the time.  She began having hallucinations_ paranoid delusions. I immediately stopped the drug and told her doctor.

I took Lunesta for the first time last night at about 12am and it is 12:57am the next night and I still have the bitter taste in the back of my throat.

If I take Lunesta for 3+ days_ I cant sleep at all for 3-4 days......Weird.  I dont like to take it every day.  So I have quit unless I HAVE to get some sleep_like a big presentation_ sales call_ etc.  I'm still waiting for the best drug ever.

As suggested by another patient_ I tried cinnamon/sugar toast (heavy on the cinnamon).  This masks the taste for about an hour_ long enough to drink several glasses of water.  Cinnamon gum also helps throughout the day.I experienced apathy as early as the first day.  However_ given the circumstances of my life and the reasons I have trouble falling asleep_ apathy is a godsend right now.  But I felt others would deem apathy as a side affect although I find apathy a relief.,I fall asleep easily in the first 10 minutes after taking the pill.  I am asleep before my husband crawls into bed_ thank God.  Before I had to fake a headache_ toothache_ stomach-ache or cramps.  But thanks to Lunesta I am fast asleep and in dream land before my husband make his move. I wake up after 6 hours of sleep and toss around for about an hour but eventually fall back to sleep.I wake up refreshed_ no drowsiness.The apathy I feel is not a negative side affect.

Noticed becoming more agitated_ sad or depressed after more than a month of using it.,I'm not really sure if Lunesta helped me or not.  At times I do feel it helped me fall asleep faster and I did stay asleep (or maybe I just couldn't remember).  Some days I felt great in the morning but very tired in the afternoon.  I feel my sleep improved but my overall energy levels during the day did not (so maybe my sleep really didn't improve).  I had a very hard time getting up some mornings as well.  Overall_ the side effect I least expected were tension headaches.  I experienced increased dizziness with vision if I stared at a CRT too long during the day (which I do for my job).  This subsided after I stopped taking it.  I can't really say that Lunesta helped me_ I perceived it to help me sleep but my energy levels just weren't there and the side effects didn't help its case either.  I felt like a walking zombie some of the time as well if I didn't get a full 8 hours or more (very important).

The pressure changes cycled about 2 to 3 times per minute.  I also had_ on a number of occasions_ but not every day_ episodes of feeling like I couldn't get enough oxygen ... like I breathing and rebreathing air into a paper sack.  I also experienced a feeling of pressure in my upper chest_ neck and head_ like my head was going to pop off!  I was thinking that I was developing asthma!   All of the symptoms were most notable during the evening hours.  I was about to make an appointment with an ENT specialist for my symptoms when it occurred to me that what I was experiencing might be side effects from the Lunesta - I stopped taking it and the sinus symptoms improved after the 1 day_ and totally disappeared after three days.

Prior to taking Lunesta the doctors in the hospital where I had my heart valve replacement surgery perscribed Ambein which had no effect on me.  To be fair_ I was on a cardiac nursing floor with about 30 other patients_ mostly much older than I_ and the constant activity and noise would have kept Rip VanWinkle awake.  My internist agreed with my suggestion that I should try this relatively new drug when I continued to have difficulty sleeping in a recliner upon my return home.  Lunesta worked well from the first night I began using it.  I would take a 3 mg. tablet about one-half hour prior to wanting to fall asleep (the times varied_ especially on weekends) and I had a guaranteed six to eight hours of sleep with no groggy feelings or other side effects in the morning.

Increased anxiety over several weeks_ personality changes_ and ear pain.,I love Lunesta_ it works much better than Ambien CR. I work at a doctor's office so I can try these new drugs easily.

As time went on_ I couldn't sleep without it. I now take half a pill nightly_ but I rarely sleep for longer than 4 - 5 hours before waking (and sometimes have trouble getting back to sleep). So I alternate with a full pill every few days to guarantee 6 - 7 hours of sleep. The addiction is troublesome (and expensive). But the worst part is the dull headache right behind my eyes throughout the day. And recently I've developed a ringing in my ears (tinnitus) which feels like it's related to the headache. Lunesta is technically not an ototoxic drug (toxic to your hearing)_ but I feel that it's responsible for the tinnitus.,M,29,1  years,12/14/2006,Lunesta

Once I stopped taking it_ the depression stopped.  I will never take it again.  Interestingly_ I did take Ambien before_ for a limited time period_ and it did not make me feel depressed at all.

Problem is every night on this med I have snapped awake after an average of 3-5 hours and have difficulty going back to sleep.

I felt like flames were going to shoot from my mouth at any moment.  I had to hold a cloth over my mouth to mask the air from hitting the back of my throat it was so horrific.

570, 5, Insomnia,Bad taste. Water and milk have a very metalic taste. Tea seems the mask the metalic taste.,Insomnia brought on by depression_ GAD_ and post traumatic stress. Works very well. The quality of sleep seems better than Ambien or Ambien CR. When I started taking sleep medication I was getting 4.5 hours of sleep and it did not matter what I took. That was better than the 1 or 2 hours I was getting without medication. I am taking Lexapro and that seems to increase the effectiveness of the sleep medication. After 3 months on Lexapro_ I can get 7.5 hours of sleep with Lunesta. Take Lunesta and go to bed. Otherwise_ you get very dizzy. I can wake up after a couple of hours and go back to sleep.,M,59,3  months,12/5/2006,Lunesta
571, 2, Couldn't Sleep,Like many other people_ the taste was awful. For me_ it lasted all throughout the night and even stayed for a while after I had brushed my teeth. I was just prescribed it last week and have only taken it once because I had weird/creepy dreams that I believed to be real until I really looked back on them_ and a some-what halluncination when I first woke up from the weird dreams.

About 1 week into taking Lunesta the headaches and vision problems started.  I figured I had a sinus infection and went to the ENT.  He found no problem.   I then went for an eye exam and no problems were found there.   I stopped taking the Lunesta and in 2 nights my problem went away.   Even in taking this GARBAGE for 3 weeks the WITHDRAWEL is not pleasant.  Please think good and hard before taking Lunesta ....,M,56,21  days,11/30/2006Email,Lunesta

Also_ I suffer from ""Lunesta Hangover"" whenever I start taking it again.  At this moment I can barely function.  I feel lethargic and I have an intense ringing in my ears.  I also have a headache.  I see/saw taking Lunesta 3 nights a week and then try to take a Lunesta break the other 4.  What happens is that I have difficulty getting to sleep the first 2 nights then it gets better.  The metalic taste goes away.  One thing I have noticed is that you shouldn't take this after bingeing.  If I eat a lot then take Lunesta it doesn't work right.  The directions tell you to avoid eating fatty foods so I guess is part of it.  I don't like this drug_ I have had severe mood swings even a panic attack and when I start taking it again I feel like I am asleep all day...after a couple of days the hangover lessons...I don't want to take this all the time but maybe if I did the side effects wouldnt start over anew each week",M,40,3  weeks,11/20/2006,Lunesta
579, 4, insomnia (why else?),bad taste in mouth; short term memeory loss,First_ let me say i have found this to be a totally benign and sometimes helpful drug  ( I am sorry some people suffer such strong side effects but they and you should realize every drug reacts differently with everyone). If i am very anxious_ it will not put to me to sleep as say Klonopin will . Sometimes I take them together (Lunesta 3 mg _ and .5 Klonopin) and i still can't sleep_ though that is very rare. It helps me get an hour or so more of uninterupted sleep (max for me is 5 hrs straight) so i take it when I am very burnt out. I think it does effect your short term memeory. And if you drink PLENTY of water during the day_ at night the taste will be much less.,M,54,1  years,11/19/2006,Lunesta

589, 5, Never sleep,Nasty taste in the mouth in the mornings (goes away with brushing); amnesia about the last 15-30 minutes before I go to sleep,I've been very impressed with Lunesta_ there are so few side effects.  I took Ambien in the hospital with my insomnia and the morning hangover was horrible.  I do think it's a little strange to try to figure out in the morning what you did the last 30 minutes before you went to sleep (I don't even remember laying down_ turning out the light_ etc.)_ but after a bit_ my mind DOES remember what I did_ it's like the Lunesta just tells it to shut down_ and it's strange that it does sometimes before the body stops moving.  I have noticed though_ that if something wakes me during the night (i.e._ children_ pets_ phone_ etc.)_ it is more difficult to get back to sleep_ I kind of lay there in a fugue in-and-out state until sleep returns.,F,46,4  months,10/27/2006,Lunesta

I did not feel sleepy because I was preoccupied and concerned about the horrible taste in my mouth; actually interfered somewhat with my breathing.  Did not fall asleep.  The metallic taste did not go away until almost a day later.  I'm never_ ever taking this drug again - throwing out the rest of the pills now!  It's ludicrous how the commercials on TV market peaceful sleep (the butterflies!) when in reality you not only do not sleep_ but have to deal with horrible taste for over a day.

I was encouraged to make it a cozy atmosphere_ free of TV or unnecessary stimulations.  I think that has been wise advise.  I fall to sleep before my husband for the first time in years.

My condition is that I can sleep 8 hours just fine_ but on a time zone somewhere in the Western Pacific (usually 4am to Noon local time_ which my bosses never liked).

There is usually a 15-30 minute foggy period after waking before I can get out of bed -- I've learned to just lay there and let the drug cook off.  I feel fully alert for the whole day after that.  About once a month (3% of the time)_ I get a dud that has no effect_ and about as frequently I get one that knocks me out almost immediately -- may be related to food or caffeine or something else.

As of tonight I will not be taking Lunesta and probably won't sleep a wink. But hopefully this will be the end of my ringing ears. I pray!!!!! Anyone ????,F,50,12  days,8/12/2006Email,Lunesta

One med to GET me to sleep (10 mg Ambien or Lunesta) and another to KEEP me asleep (Ativan_ Oxazapam_ or 3 AM Ambien fragments) for 8 or so hours. I started Lunesta when it first came on the market as an alternative to Ambien. Ambien did well for several years prior until I developed an intense 'leftover' feeling that I could not overcome no matter how low the dosage.  Lunesta seemed to work at the 4 or 5 mg level at first with few side effects.  Due to insurance restrictions_ I had to cut down to 3 mg Lunesta plus take 5 mg Ambien.  Although not perfect sleep_ I managed to subsist until June 06 when I began to experience headaches in increasing frequency.  I cut down the Lunesta to 1.5 mg (pill-splitting) to reduce the intensity of the headaches.  The lower dose was not as effective in getting me to sleep and I did not sleep as long (3 hours usually).  Headaches persisted until I just stopped the Lunesta two nights ago.  I am still taking,M,52,14  months,7/20/2006Email,Lunesta

(BTW_ this is the first sleep aid to help me significantly in 4 years...I tried Ambien_ Halcion_ Xanax_ Valuim_ Benedryl_ Unisom_ and Tylenol PM in the past. ),F,30,4  months,4/30/2006,Lunesta
677, 4, Working 12am to 10am - Insomnia,Unpleasant taste. Extreme anxiety after 12 hours from taking my first dose (2mg). Vivid dreams.,"Have been taking Restoril 15mg for insomnia_ but would wake up after 4 to 5 hours. Lunesta does work for 7 - 8 hours_ but I ended up with extreme anxiety (rebound?) after it wore off the first time. I had to take .25mg of xanax to calm down. I did not have any anxiety the second time I took it. I was able to get around that long lasting (7 hour) unpleasant taste by ""cleaning off"" the powder on the pill and putting it way back on my tongue and washing it down quickly.With Restoril I can still wake up and be functional within the 4 - 5 hours it is in effect. Lunesta really knocked me out for around 7 hours and there was no way that I could do anything but sleep. This is a good thing since I can now choose which to take depending on my situtation.",M,42,2  days,4/29/2006,Lunesta
678, 2, Insomnia,Grogginess the day after ingestion preventing me from using power tools in my shop. Felt physically rested but psychologically wasted.

680, 5, chronic insomnia & RLS,No bad taste or any other distressing side effects.  However_ after taking for a few months_ I have noticed an increase in my anxiety/nervousness.  Recently I have started experiencing occasional and random spells of dizziness/lightheadedness during the day that last less than 15 seconds...only occasionally though and not constantly/daily; it may occur three times a week and then not happen for two weeks...but I am starting to become concerned if it's Lunesta related.,I have suffered from sleep deprivation and all of it's distressing symptoms for some years now due to chronic insomnia and RLS (Restless Legs Syndrome)...Lunesta has granted me restorative sleep and decreased my nightime wake-ups almost completely. Initially I took Lunesta 1-3 days/week. After 4-5 months I began taking it daily (3mg). This summer when I'm not in school or clincial_ I am going to quit Lunesta for a few weeks to evaluate my dependency_ mysterious dizziness spells_ and increasing anxiety.  All in all_ I recommend the drug and intend on still taking it.,M,28,8  months,4/22/2006Email,Lunesta

I take one every night about an hour before bed and sleep through the night.  I wake up feeling great and ready for the day.

684, 3, insomnia,I started taking Lunesta in January of 2006_ it worked great from January to around the first week of March_ but then I started to develop a dull headache each day with pressure right behind both eyes.  Went to my doctor_ and eye doctor_ they said everything was fine but pointed out that Lunesta side effect can be headaches.,Stopped taking Lunesta last night after almost a solid month of headaches.  No headache today...I don't think that I'll take it again.  Sure_ I slept great on it and yes_ I had the bad taste in my mouth most mornings and felt a little groggy during the day_ but it's not worth the headache.  I hope the headache is gone tomorrow too_ then I'll know for sure that it was the Lunesta causing it.  It was strange that it took nearly two months of taking it before the headache developed.,M,37,3  months,4/4/2006Email,Lunesta

688, 2, Sleep disorder,It did help get to sleep and give a good night's rest but after just the third day of taking Lunesta I found myself tired_ anxious_ distractable_ and extremely irritable.  I was losing my temper_ to an unreasonable degree_ at the slightest thing.  I did notice a bad taste but it wasn't overwhelming as some have reported.,I discontinued use after I punched my car when I walked into the hatch on the back.

691, 2, lack of sleep,I was taking Lunesta for about 4 months. One side affect was the bad taste but that I could deal with. It made Milk taste horrible. I noticed from the beginning that lunesta gave me the shakes. It's hard to explain but I did not feel steady. I definitely woke up refreshed  but I started to have excess flem in my throat& nothing would help it. The regular doc couldn't treat it & said to go to an ear nose & toroat doc. The only thing that helped was stopping the lunesta. I averaged about 5 to 6 hours sleep with the lunesta & after a while starteds to feel dizzy (constantly) from it & I never remembered anything my wife told me. It was good for the extra sleep but overall; it wasn't worth it for me.,Workks for most..not for me,M,37,5  months,3/14/2006Email,Lunesta

I have had a sharp pain across my chest every morning about a week or two after I started taking it.  I'm switching medications because of the latter issue.  I mean it did help my insomnia; I was out for a few solid hours (2-3 hours of uninterrupted sleep)_ but it is just too much of a coincidence that I am having this sever muscle/chest pain.

Unfortunately_ I only take it 2 or 3 times a week because of the bad taste. I have found 2 things help with that. Make sure the pill does NOT get stuck in your throat by drinking a glass of OJ_ and keep a pack of the Listerine Citrus breath strips for the next day. Turns out the bad taste is an alkaline ph change of your saliva_ the only thing that seems to neutalize it are the Listerine Citus flavor breath strips.

The danger is that a consumer may assume it's OK to use it like aspirin or vitamins_ but there's not enough data yet about its safety.  Moreover_ it's not as effective as Ambien.,M,65,6  months,1/4/2006,Lunesta

The night I took a baseball bat to one of their old bikes and told my husband I didn't want to be a parent anymore (I am a stepparent)_ I finally realized something was REALLY wrong and started researching the side effects more deeply.

725, 2, Difficulty falling/ staying asleep,I took Lunesta for four days after using Ambien for years.  I usually break a 10mg Ambien in half which usually works_ and I wanted to avoid any tolerance_ so my MD recommended I switch.  The main side effects I noticed were morning grogginess which lasted throughout most of the day_ as well as the foul_ bitter taste in my mouth.  This taste never went away throughout the course of taking the medication.  I could barely drink anything_ particularly water_ and other tastes were distorted_ overall.,I am not able to recommend this medication.  It was far less effective than Ambien in putting me to sleep.

My doctor worked with me to find the correct dosing-the most important part of taking this med is that when you are ready to go to bed_ take it and immediately get into your favorite sleeping position. If you are not in dreamland within 15 minutes tops_ then remember to lay off any caffeine or other stimulants a few hours before bedtime. It really does work-the negative reviews may be due to some people fighting the med and trying to stay awake_ but everyone is different so experiment between 1 and 3 mg to find your correct dose. As for the horrible taste_ it goes away with in a few days provided you stick with it! Good luck to all.,M,40,3  months,12/2/2005,Lunesta

I also experienced really odd and strange dreams before i woke up.,it sorta helped me sleep_ it's kinda hit or miss.  It worked the first night_ but not the second_ but then the third_ but not the fourth or fifth...  it's really random.  I also have thought my milk went bad due to the bad taste.  Water_ Coke_ and milk all taste so horrible i can not drink them.  I heard a side effect was a bad taste_ but i had no idea how incredibly bad it is.  I tried Ambien before_ and it helped at first but it always made me really tired when i took it.  When i take lunesta_ i can stay up for hours and not feel sleepy at all.  I also tend to wake up to early.  the bad taste is what keeps me from taking it again.  I reccomend that if you like to eat food that doesn't taste like it's been laced with poison_ don't take lunesta.,F,21,7  days,12/1/2005,Lunesta
731, 1, sleep deprivation,itching_ inability to fall asleep_ slow acting_ once Lunesta took effect_ drifting off to slip was horrifying and i quickly awoke.  woke several times during the night and woke up exhausted.  tried Lunesta the next night to catch up on lost sleep with the same results.  during the day was tired but at night could not fall asleep and stay asleep with Lunesta.  bad taste in mouth_ severe headache which lasted 4-5 days_ trouble breathing_ anxiety and an overall BAD EXPERIENCE.,POISON.  ALMOST WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.,F,51,2  days,11/29/2005,Lunesta
732, 3, severe insomnia,Terrible_ terrible taste - at night and morning_ I've also lost my sense of taste on somethings and other's are warped.  I've also been feeling nauseous for the last few days.  And I'm tired every day.  Just too many side effects for me. I'll be stopping.,It worked for a few days_ but it doesn't really anymore.  The tiredness has occured the entire time.  Last night I slept for two hours_ then woke up startled and didn't go back to sleep.  I've also had more clarity in my dreams,F,33,8  days,11/23/2005,Lunesta
733, 3, unable to sleep/stay asleep,"this will be my 3rd night taking lunesta.  I immediately got a very unpleasant taste in my mouth that I could taste only when I inhaled.  it seemed to coat even the roof of my mouth.  i can only describe it as a ""gross i just chewed asprin"" taste mixed with ""eew i just drank orange juice after brushing my teeth"" taste.  i still don't stay asleep.the first night i woke up after 7 hours_ and that was cool_ i guess my body was done sleeping.  so i lounged in bed a while_ cuz i still felt groggy and i didn't really feel like doing anything.  i went to the living room and proceed to take almost a two hour nap while watching tv_ and had AWFUL dreams.  I usually do_ but this time_ it involved disgusting smells.  Research shows that people do not smell in dreams_ but they are WRONG... I was gagging in my dream it smelled so bad.  The second night_ I woke up after 5 hours_ had to use the bathroom (i also take detrol la) then went back to bed for a couple hours... I hav",,F,33,3  days,11/18/2005,Lunesta
734, 5, Insomnia,The only side-effect would be the Metallic taste in the morning to aft. But hey! - keeps me from eating too much ;),This has really helped me. I've had insomnia - mostly severe night waking - for 32 years. Recently_ it had worsened with life-stress and peri-menopuase. I am SO Thankful for Lunesta I can't begin to describe...,F,51,45  days,11/14/2005Email,Lunesta
735, 4, help stay asleep,I have not experienced the bad taste that so many others seem to have had.  However_ I have noticed_ as well as my husband_ that I have been a lot more irritable/anxious the last couple of days_ which is not something that is normal for me...,Overall_ it has helped me fall asleep faster and wake up less during the night.  I feel fine in the mornings with no bad taste.  However_ it did not start working until about the third night of taking it.,F,23,6  days,11/12/2005,Lunesta
736, 2, To stay asleep the whole night,Bad taste in the morning. Nervousness/jitteryness/trembling of my jaw. Effectiveness is hit-or-miss. Never did sleep through the night. Going from 2mg to 3mg only added about 1-hour to my sleep.,"As with most folks_ the bad taste in the morning was my first side-effect. At first I thought it was a tooth going bad (I was already scheduled for a crown and a filling was leaking) until I saw the commercial.  Now I have determined that it causes nervousness/jitteryness/trembling of my jaw .I thought I was having side effect from my HBP meds (on #5). I had stopped all caffene drinks for more then 2-weeks but was still jittery. Then I decided to switch back to Ambien (which is a hit-or-miss on effectiveness). After two days off Lunesta_ I realized that my jitteryness was subsiding (my doctor had already prescribed some diazepam to help_ since he was running out of ideas on what was causing the jitteryness). I switched back to Lunesta last night and now I am ""bouncing off the walls"" again_ including the trembling jaw.",M,47,4  weeks,11/12/2005,Lunesta
737, 4, insomnia,I didn't notice the bad taste_ but definitely my sense of smell is heightened after taking this medication. I'm feeling very emotional and a bit anxious lately_ but that could also be due to the personal issues that led to the insomnia in the first place :-) I've had some odd dreams_ which is unusual.,This definitely has helped me sleep through the night. I take it half an hour before going to bed_ and while I might wake once to go to the restroom_ I'm not waking 2-3 times any more. I can go right back to sleep after waking up at night.,F,40,5  days,11/10/2005,Lunesta
738, 1, can't sleep,the worst taste in my mouth ever! i too also thought the water was contaminated then it continued to the next day. what a horrible side effect.. i would rather stay up all night than experience the horrible taste that lingered in my mouth. i do not recommend this drug!,waited for two hours and didn't fall asleep. same as usual. do these pills even work...,F,31,1  days,11/10/2005,Lunesta
739, 1, long-term Insomnia,Insomnia - not a wink of sleep two nights running despite taking a 2 mg pill each night and going right to bed. This is the exact opposite of what this drug is supposed to accomplish!,Fortunately I obtained the free two-pill sample_ rather than buying a full prescription which would have cost an arm and a leg. Having to throw away most of them would have been money down the drain. I would be happy to pay - if the drug worked. I did not experience bad taste or anything unpleasant_ I just lay awake all night. After the first night I called my pharmacy to make sure I had not been given the wrong medicine but it was correct. I hope others have a better outcome than I did as insomnia is a terrible curse.,F,69,2  days,11/2/2005,Lunesta

741, 3, Unable to stay asleep,This was my first night taking Lunesta. I have been up for 7 hours now with no visible side effects. I have not experienced the bad taste in my mouth others have noticed.,I did not work as fast I would of liked. But once I fell asleep I was able to stay asleep.,M,30,1  days,11/1/2005,Lunesta
742, 2, Multiple awakenings during night,My mouth tastes bad in the morning with or without Lunesta,Seemed to work for first month_ cutting wake-ups from 4-5 to 2-3. After that_ it did very little. Having taken Ambien before this_ I had great hopes that L. would work better. I'm back to Ambien_ which in the long run works better. If you have wake-up problems consider Ambien sustained-release_ which just hit the market. Gee_ time capsules....duh_ what a concept. But it allows the manufacturer to maintain it's patent another 10 years. I haven't tried yet but plan to ask my Doc to switch me.,M,53,2  months,10/28/2005Email,Lunesta
743, 3, sleep aid,I have experienced a terrible metal taste that starts when I take the pill and stays until the next afternoon.,I have problems sleeping more than 2 hours at a time. This pill will allow me to sleep for 4 then I wake up. I can go back to sleep for an additonal 2 or 3 hours. I have never been able to get more than 6 or 7 hours of sleep from the pill,F,61,4  months,10/26/2005Email,Lunesta
744, 5, insomnia_ Hypertension_ APKD,Bad taste in mouth_ easily fixed with 98 cent cinnamon / rasin bagels from wal-mart_ in fact_ these taste wonderful right now :) Bad taste subsides over time_ about the 4th or 5th morning after and the taste problem subsides_ but is still present to a lesser degree.,I took lunesta 2mg along with lisinopril 10mg (for hypertension) I smile my way to sleep at night and all my worries and anxiety are relieved so I can sleep. LUNESTA is NOT sleep inducing like narcotics etc_ I think of lunesta as a sleep aid_ you actually have to WANT to sleep for it to be effective_ I have stayed awake because I wanted to on lunesta and it didnt induce sleep at all_ leading me to the conclusion that its a state of mind thing for it to work.,M,24,15  days,10/25/2005,Lunesta
745, 1, Insomnia,The first night I had some nightmares from taking it and was shocked that it didn't completely knock me out. It causes very bad breath that is almost unmanagable - its almost like my tongue is a different color [some sort of bit of black in the color of it]. I wondered why I started to get some acid reflux then I see on here that others have gotten it as well. I'm glad it's not addictive at least [as the Ambien caused some weird heart papitations]. I'm not happy to have read on here that the bad breath doesn't go away right away. I'm afraid not to take it because I cannot function on my job if I loose a nights sleep. Ambien always knocked me out pretty good. Even the three mil tablets do not really cause me to sleep deeply. I think the ads are fraudulent and it's more like your breath is like green smoke coming out of your mouth. So the choice is...not addicted with bad breath_ or addicted without bad breath.,,F,46,30  days,10/25/2005,Lunesta

750, 1, insomnia,extremely nasty nasty taste in my mouth after taking this medication.Yuk!:/Doesn't help me fall asleep any faster either_ and I think it makes me cranky_ and also causes problems with memory.  I can't remember what someone said to me just a few minutes ago_ and seeing as this has NEVER been a problem for me before taking this_ I can only attribute it to this.  Now_ I feel I must go scrub the inside of my mouth with about a half a tube of toothpaste....maybe it will help the nasty taste in my mouth.  :P,,M,38,2  times,10/18/2005,Lunesta

754, 1, insomnia,Horrible taste in my mouth.  The taste started within 1/2 hour of taking the pill.  I asked my husband to taste my water because I thought the water supply had been poisoned.  The taste never went away.  Also developed bad heartburn.,Didn't make me sleepy.  I relied on taking something else to help me sleep.,F,52,4  months,10/13/2005,Lunesta
755, 4, chronic insomnia going on 5 years n,Definitely the aftertaste.  I too threw out a gallon of milk because I thought it went bad only to find it the the after taste of the Lunesta.  I've been on it since April when it first came out so that's about 6 months.  I've been feeling quite anxious lately and am not sure if that can be attributed to the Lunesta or just a lot of flux in my job and personal life.  It does somehow feel that at least some of it is a side effect but hard to tell if it's just an overall anxious feeling that's being produced or what not.,I've taken several drugs for insomnia and this is the only one that puts me to sleep in 30 minutes to and hour and lets me sleep the entire night through.  With Ambien_ although I was down for the count in 15 minutes_ I sprung back up from sleep at about 2 AM every night ready to take on the world_ couldn't get back to sleep_ and by 5 when it was time to get up_ was totally draggin.  Lunesta doesn't have this effect.  Once you take it it's sleepytime for the whole night.  And_ after 6 months of taking it I either don't notice or don't have the bad taste.  I can even drink milk in the morning again.,F,38,6  months,10/12/2005Email,Lunesta

759, 1, To sleep,Ended up in the hospital because I didn't go to bed right away.  My child called 911 because I was a blubbering idiot.  Have no idea what happened because I was confused and disoriented.  Had that weird taste in my mouth and was told by the nursing staff and paramedics that I was under the influence of alcohol.(All I can think of is the metallic taste on my breath) I was fine before I took the Lunesta_ I've only taken this medication once before but at least I just went to bed. Of course_ I won't be taking it again.  I read another rating about being sensitive to medications.  It seems like I have every bad reaction to any medication that is prescribed to me... I guess I should just quit taking any and all medications_ it's two days later and I still have that nasty taste in my mouth....,I've only takin this medication on one other evening.....,F,41,1  days,10/8/2005,Lunesta

762, 3, insomnia,at first I did not notice any side effects with the exception of the severe metallic taste in my mouth but after 4 months of taking Lunesta on a daiy basis either that metallic taste went away or I got used to it.  But now like I said after 4 months of taking Lunesta on a daily basis I have very bad depression and nervousness and I have started to loose tons of hair ( for a woman with hair down to her waist and very thick) it's very unnerving!!! My scalp tingles and feels very tight especially when I notice I am more stressed than usual and it feels like I can feel my hair snapping off my scalp.  I would not recommed taking this drug long term expecially if the reason you can't sleep is caused by anxiety becaue one of the side effects that is listed is nervousness.,,F,35,4  months,9/29/2005Email,Lunesta
763, 2, Help in getting to & staying asleep,An extremely nasty after-taste in my mouth that has now lasted well into the next day.  I had milk and cookies last night before bed and the milk tasted absolutely horrible; so bad_ I dumped the quart of milk down the sink because I thought it was no good.  Even water tastes bad.  Also_ because of this nasty after-taste_ I've felt nauseous all day and couldn't and didn't want to eat anything and fearing I was going to get sick at any time.  Last night was the first night I ever took the medicine and I'm not taking it until I speak with my doctor to see what else is out there or just take Tylenol PM when I can't fall asleep.,By the way_ it took me over 3 hours to fall asleep after taking the medicine.  Quick relief in falling asleep -- NOT!  This left me edgy and easily irritated today because I only was able to get about 5 hours of sleep before I had to get up this morning.,F,42,1  days,9/27/2005,Lunesta

765, 1, Insomnia,The worst metallic-chemical taste in my mouth that I've ever experienced.  I couldn't even drink water...I made my husband call Poland Springs the following day after a fresh delivery (the day of the evening that I first took Lunesta) and complain that we got a delivery of bad water!  Obviously_ I've since realized it was the Lunesta.  I also noticed it wasn't very effective.  I'll never take it again.   Side effects intolerable and it didn't even induce sleep.  (For me anyway.),,F,30,2  days,9/20/2005,Lunesta
766, 3, insomnia,Anxiety_ weakness_ shakiness_ rebound insomnia.  Tip:  to avoid the metal taste_ don't let the tab sit on your tongue and wash the tab down with milk instead of water.  Also_ do not cut the tab.,I am one of those lucky people who has every type of insomnia imaginable:  delayed sleep onset_ frequent night awakenings_ and waking too early in the morning.  I tried Ambien but rebounded terribly from it_ waking up 2 hours after taking it ready to climb Mt. Everest after warming up with a marathon.  I figured the rebound was due to the very fast elimination rate of Ambien.  When Lunesta came out_ I got excited because its elimination rate is three times longer than Ambien's.  The manufacturer's claims are correct--Lunesta helped me fall asleep with 20-30 minutes_ and I stayed asleep for about 6-7 hours.  Unfortunately_ I experienced the same rebound symptoms from Lunesta that I did with Ambien_ albeit less intense but for a longer duration.  It seems I am very much an aberration_ though.  Most people don't have these rebound problems--I am just very sensitive to medication.  If it weren't for my rebound symptoms_ I would gladly take Lunesta regularly.  It did exactly as it promised.,M,25,1  days,9/19/2005,Lunesta
767, 3, insomnia due to hypomania,Nasty taste in my mouth. Memory loss. May have triggered a depressive episode.,This drug is the only sleeping pill that has ever given me deep_ restorative sleep. I took it for 70 days every night. After a while_ if I did not get enough sleep despite having taken it_ I would wake up depressed_ much more so than if I had not taken it and slept badly. It usually lifted by mid day after lots of coffee. One day it didn't lift and I fell into the worst  depression of my life. I strongly suspect that 70 days on this drug pushed me into this_ but I cannot say for sure. The bad taste in my mouth was pretty foul after 70 days and it took 3 weeks to go away. There was also the memory loss. I had no recollection of having sex with my wife one night which landed me in the doghouse big time. This drug has some real plusses. I wish i could continue taking it.,M,38,70  days,9/15/2005,Lunesta
