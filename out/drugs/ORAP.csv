0, 5, OCD Intrusive unwanted thoughts,Initially had problems with restless leg syndrome and feeling like I couldn't sit still and be comfortable.  This went away and may have been helped had I gradually worked my dosage up.,I am 39 years old and have had OCD since my early teens.  The most unsettling part of my OCD was the intrusive unwanted thoughts.  This drug has been a miracle for me since the thoughts are 99.9% gone now.  My brilliant psychiatrist tried this with me and it has truly changed my life.,M,39,7  years,5/31/2009,Orap
