The neurologist suggested increasing the dosage and it seemed to make things worse_ and I started noticing the dystonia would come & go depending how long it had been since I'd taken the medicine.  The doctor suggested botox injections in my leg which didn't appeal to me.  After much research in books & on the internet_ I began to suspect the medicine was causing the dystonia.  I told the doctor I wanted to stop the meds & got instructions on how to stop it.  The dystonia is gone and I feel great.

I was also taking Azilect but discontinued to see if it was interfering with the Sinemet.  Was also on REQUIP but it caused a number of side effects of it's own.

40, 1, My Dad had Parkinsons.,Please see my orriginal note on 8/6/2008. I have included my email address. Dad became very delusional and we were afraid to keep him at home. He rarely slept and was combative all the time. He had me take him to the hospital so they could terminate his life.,Dad would rip out his IV's at the hospital. We couldn't keep him at home like this_ so Mom and I decided to take him off the Sinemet. He was acting so paranoid and aggressive he would have to be locked up. We refused to do that. Dad became much happier and like his old self when he went off the Sinemet. We were able to keep him home until he died on Feb 1st of this year. This drug works great at first_ then seems to build up and turn on the patient. In my opinion_ it should be taken off the market. Find something else!  I am putting my Dad's gender and age down.

I did find that taking the pills with a full glass of warm water and not taking them on an empty stomach did help.  Sugar-free hard candy also helped with the bad taste in my mouth. Currently_ I am in the process of adjusting the dose and adding an agonist (Requip) at bed time to find the right combination and dosages to best address my symptoms.

45, 2, symptoms after Keppra increase,muscle weakness in both arms and legs within 36 hours; inability to stand or walk without two large people helping to lift him up_ in doctor's office_ fatigue--whereas prior to drug he could walk slowly to bathrooom with a walker just fine. (In short_ same results as when he tried this same drug in 2005),It concerns me that the neurologists keep pushing Parkinsons meds like this one and Mirapex on my dad.  An 84-year old man with a prior cerebral hemorrhage from a vehicle accident_ who's on increased Keppra dosage needed to avoid new seizure problems_ plus BP meds_ cholestrol drugs_ Terazosin_ Plavix_ Zoloft and others_ who also has neuropathy_ severe sleep apnea and no CPAP yet (getting retested) could have increased slowness_ problems walking and falls for a number of reasons.I am guessing that treatment via Parkinsons meds for symptoms of slowness and falls is likely a standard AMA protocol once someone is in their 80's_ even if other causes are a possibility_ especially since Parkinsons diagnosis is limited to observing visual symptoms.  Therefore neurologists are afraid not to prescribe Parkinsons meds?  A respected Chicago hospital had already declared my dad does not have Parkinsons disease; only features of Parkinsons (shuffling_ etc.)_ yet once we come back home_ that's all we get from the local neuros.  All I can say is beware:  consider looking at other causes of the symptoms AND getting other opinions before using this drug--every article I have seen written by patients/families on the internet seem to contain a number of horror stories about this drug.

52, 3, Parkinson's disease,Sleepiness_ dyskinesia_ mental slowness,For those recently diagnosed with PD: take advantage of all you can - you'll never feel better than you do now. I was diagnosed with PD in 2001. I've taken Sinemet for 7 years. After 6 years of relatively good control of my PD symptoms on Sinemet_ I began to have dyskinesias or unintentional or dystonic movements and spasms. My co-workers thought I was drunk. But inside I was a mass of clenched muscles_ especially in the jaw_ neck_ upper body. Sinemet kept me going rather smoothly for 6 years_ but now I walk a tightrope between PD symptoms and side-effects. Sinemet also slows me down mentally_ like I was drugged. (Laugh - I am!)
