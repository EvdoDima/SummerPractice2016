11, 2, Depression,I started rubbing my big toe and the one right beside it back and forth constantly (24/7). This is happening with both feet. Even when wearing tight shoes which makes my toes ache. I quit taking the Ability about a year ago because of this but this annoying side effect won't go away. I have to put Bandaids on my toes to keep from getting calluses. It is so bad that i wear holes through the Bandaids. I think this nerve wrecking side effect is permanent!  I regret ever taking it!,As far as helping with my depression there was very little difference.,F,60,2  years5 MG,3/13/2016Email,Abilify
12, 5, depression,Good effect within 5 days. Better concentration and less procrastination. Mood stable. Sleepy a bit. Will take at night.,I suppose this med is good depending on the other stuff one has been diagnosed with. Too many young people on too many different meds. I take Lexapro 20 MG /day. This is a good med for certain types of depression. Multiple disorders are another issue I think.,F,58,10  weeks5mg,3/9/2016,Abilify
13, 5, Bipolar 1 Disorder,Easily Angered.,Abilify has saved my life and made the quality of it back to normal. I tried every med in the book and was in a mental hospital for 9 months. I do not get the akathesia_ insomnia_ or weight gain. I switched from Invega due to tenderness of the nipple. I notice this drug is used at its full potential by CLASSIC Bipolar 1 individuals. Bipolar 2 people it doesn't help with your depression. I used to take Abilify with Lithium but my Lithium levels were so low for a long time due to weight gain from Invega that I only take Abilify now. My only itch with this medicine is that it makes me easily angered.,M,21,4  months5 MG 1X M,3/4/2016Email,Abilify
14, 4, Treatment Resistant Depression,Weight gain,I think this drug is good_ and actually helps for serious depression. I haven't had any serious episodes while taking it_ but it's not a miracle drug. I have gained 20 pounds since starting this medication. I feel like I crave carbohydrates more. The weight gain has really been a struggle for me_ but if it keeps the depression to a somewhat tolerable level_ then I suppose it's worth it.,F,39,6  months5 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Abilify
15, 1, diagnosed with bipolar,50 lb weight gain. Akathesia_ constipation_ suicidal thoughts_ depression_ restlessness_,Abilify is a horrible drug and did nothing for me but harm. What it does is cause a whole host of extremely undesirable side effects (as well as make drug companies very rich_ as do all antipsychotics.) Given my years of experience with antipsychotics I have come to despise them because of their inefficacy to provide any substantial benefit_ what they do is completely numb emotions and cause mental states like apathy and also suicidal ideations_ they are also effective at sedation and taking away a persons will to live. I also philosophically do not believe the current mental health model because its all geared towards making a profit at the cost of the livelihoods of patients. It is all a shameful scam and if you have a choice you should all-together avoid the system. Do so at all costs for your own well-being.,M,28,1  years10 MG 1X D,3/1/2016,Abilify
16, 5, Depression augmented with abilify,Nausea_ acne_ itching skin. Restlessness_ talking a lot need to read and walk around at the same time_ vomiting after reasonably vigorously exercises such as walking. Slowed intestinal motility_ minor food cravings_ I'm watching the weight gain and fighting it to the death. This is NOT necessary!! It is so far the least of the culprits for mysterious and seemingly uncontrollable weight gain. I would blame some or most of that on the effects and the way the body is affected from hormones like prolactin and others you just can't control your own entire brain.  First two days at 2 mg I was light headed hungry nauseous and walking and excercizing to work through the beginning,Hunger not uncontrollable! Eat the healthy food. Prepair meals maybe if you have motivation to use! Yes I had the restlessness. I kept reading thinking and pacing. Walk; even if it's a small space indoors. It's worth working through its my favorite choice so far in regards to the PARTIAL agonist at select dopamine receptors it worked fast. I might get to a point where my depression could lift and I would feel happy again_ like the early school years! I have high hopes now.,F,31,3  months10mg,2/26/2016,Abilify
17, 2, Sever bipolar with psychotic feat.,"Apathy_ extreme coldness to loved ones_ lethargy_ wait gain of around 50 lbs_ spontaneous near fainting dizzyness ( horrible while working) nausea and vomiting.  I don't know if this counts as a side effect but after Abilify I don't trust taking any pill even ""harmless"" ones. (Was told Abilify is harmless)",Hate it. It made me mellow and not hear voices but at what cost? I became so apathetic towards my partner and parents I didn't care if I saw them or not. Didn't care if I was hurting them or not ( never pysicaly). Had no goals or drive to do anything just wanted to sit. Not do anything. And veg. Several times at work I almost fainted and was suspected to be on illegal drugs because I just left not caring about informing my employer. Did nothing for my extreme paranoia and may have made it worse as was somewhat forced to take this drug by my partner. Before I took it I was bad and really delusional so I understand why but I still resent them for it. So I stopped taking it and slowly got back to my manic self... I think I like this better than feeling dead but not caring. My guy wants me back on it but idk if can even bring myself to eat another pill.,M,20,1  years20,2/7/2016,Abilify

20, 5, Bipolar disorder,When starting the med I noticed a difference in manic/depressive cycling within 2 weeks and was stabilized and at baseline by 4 weeks. I was very impressed. I did experience some weight gain but it was not bothersome for me. I also experienced blurred vision that became progressively worse as I continued to take the medication. Discontinuing use does not improve this. In fact my eyes continue to become more and more blurred and frankly I AM concerned with going blind eventually. Other side effects I have experienced discontinuing abilify are nausea vomiting and drastic weight loss for about 3 weeks after my last dose. I will note that I was not nauseous or vomiting until about 2 weeks after my last dose. I also experienced body dysmorphia from the weight loss which made the depression and mania cycling worse. I have not enjoyed discontinuing the drug and look forward to securing another prescription soon. Also since continuing I constantly feel itchy especially my hands and feet and shoes are inconvenient because if this. I also have lost an alarming amount of hair. I do find this somewhat distressing. I have not had any medication since discontinuing 4.5 months ago and am currently in manic cycle.,,F,43,5  years40 mg,1/23/2016Email,Abilify
21, 2, psy: you need to control your brain,After initially taking the drug in my early 20s I was convinced that it was helping me_ clarifying my thoughts_ lifting my mood_ giving me some stability in my changing life events and difficult experiences_ the shock of dropping out of uni + other things. After a couple of years I noticed It became harder to study_ and remember things but I took this as something that I had to work harder on to overcome. Only after I graduated from uni and decided to come off it myself_ I experienced terrible effects: these are as follows_ brain paralysis_ terrible short term memory_ forgetting things in seconds_ repeat what I do_ and do not know what I have done. There are times when my memory is so poor it just goes blank and I feel I may have alzheimers. My concentration is so bad_ I miss obvious detail. My neck twists in contortions it is so embarrassing- tardive dystonia which has not been diagnosed. During withdrawal I had terrible headaches_ nothing for the pain_ I could not sleep at all as the,Abilify may seem good at first but do not take it for a very long time on your own.

22, 5, Schitzoaffective/Psychosis,fatigue_ after giving birth_ had to increase methadone,Abilify worked great when I was pregnant. I was also on 15mg methadone. After I had the baby_ though_ I was exhausted_ and had to increase to 40 and it was hard to taper down on the methadone. I stopped taking it 8 months after I had the baby. It didn't completely get rid of the hallucinations and delusions_ but I was able to rationalize them and not get out of control.,F,34,16  months15mg 1X D,1/2/2016Email,Abilify
23, 2, Anorexia Nervosa Depression/Anxiety,WEIGHT GAIN of 30 pounds_ excess appetite_ EXTREME tiredness_ acne_ facial dropping_ dizziness,I was put on this medication for my anxiety/OCD surrounding my anorexia nervosa. It stopped the anorexia in it's tracks_ but it killed me. It was only supposed to be a short term medication_ but my parents tried to cut me off cold turkey and at bad times so they thought I was addicted when I wasn't. I was able to eventually taper off it and lose all the weight I gained on it. As a result I was on it for two years. I gained 30 pounds. Some weight was normal_ but I think 15 of it was excess. I couldn't lose the weight no matter what I did to exercise_ and I couldn't stop eating and could never tell when I was hungry or full. I got made fun of so much and my own family made fun of me_ so my depression got worse. It also made me VERY VERY tired. I initially started at 5 mg but then I had to go to 2.5 because I almost fainted because it made me so tired_ and even the 2.5 made me tired enough to have to take naps during the day. I also had facial drooping for the first week_ but then that went away. I was told that was normal. It did it's job with helping stop the anorexia but the side effects were brutal and it didn't help my other problems.,F,20,2  years2.5 1X D,12/29/2015,Abilify

It also slowed down my metabolism. I gained 25 pounds in three months_ and it took me almost 18 months to lose that weight because of my sluggish metabolism.

Nausea_ acid reflux. Some people stare at me like I'm weird in public.,I was given this to help me calm down my thoughts. I have social phobia and I don't think it's helped this at all; it may have made it worse. When I go out to restaurants_ I feel more wired_ and it's not a pleasant feeling_ but it's hard to describe. I do notice some benefits_ like I'm not walking around like a wounded_ hurting animal anymore_ and when I see things that used to make me feel jealous or hurt (like couples or friends together_ or women with babies) it no longer has such a hurtful impact on me. I don't know what to do with this medicine_ b/c I notice benefits_ but the increased uncomfortable feeling is kind of hard to deal with_ and the worst thing is that some other people look at me like something's wrong with me. This has happened at the past 2 restaurants I went to; two different older men looked at me like there was something wrong with me.  I am on the fence with this drug; I think I should give it more time to see how I adjust_ but the uncomfortable_ wired_ anxious-like feeling I get from it can be embarrassing for me_ especially when other people look at me like there's something wrong with me.

49, 1, OCD; adjunct to Zoloft,At first I had no side effects or benefits from the drug_ so my doctor had me titrate up to 6 mg a day_ over a period of about a month. I was only on 6 mg for about a day before I ran out of medication_ so I went two days without any Abilify at all_ and then went back on 6 mg. Within half a day of restarting the drug_ I was more anxious and panicky than I've ever experienced_ and that's saying something. I was paranoid and developed massive social anxiety issues almost immediately_ thinking everyone was constantly discussing how weird I was_ reanalyzing conversations I had and feeling incredibly embarrassed at everything I said. I started having non-stop insatiable What-Ifs that were totally implausible_ but were so terrible to me that I wanted to jump out a window just to distract myself from the unstoppable stress and doubt. I read afterward that Abilify has a very long half life - about 3 days. It's been about 6 days since I stopped the drug and the anxiety is not much better. I can,Abilify is scarier than any drug I've been prescribed. If your life isn't already at rock bottom_ I'd be very wary of risking this drug_ especially with so many others saying the same sort of thing.,F,30,30  days6 mg 1X D,5/28/2015Email,Abilify

This feeling of restlessness has persisted for 14 months AND COUNTING after discontinuing. It has been the most devestating thing of my life. THIS DRUG SHOULD NOT BE LEGAL. BE AFRAID. I took dozens of psyc meds including seroquel by the handful for 10 years and nothing that bad ever came of it. Is this permanent?

It sucked because it made me severly hungry_ like I could never get enough food but I ignored the extra hunger and still cut myself off when I knew I was full. But everytime I ate_ if I did not throw up I would have a lingering nausea that lasted all day to the point that I actually had to make myself throw up in order to feel better. The sickness would not go away until I vomited so if it didn't happen on its own_ I would force myself to. Not good_ I am not bulemic. Also noticed weight gain even with constant vomiting. Puking that much should never result in weight GAIN. Also caused crippling dizziness_ had to lay down throughout the day or I felt like I was going to faint. So I stopped taking it.,F,29,3  weeks40mg 1X D,5/6/2015,Abilify

His attitude changed too. He became very calm after taking it at first but after a few hours he would lose it hitting himself and others. Yelling and was very impatient. His appetite changed too he went from barely eating to wanting to eat all the time and now he doesn't eat much at all. For about the last two months he has been super constipated and throws up randomly at night. But has no recollection Of what happened like he does it when he's sleeping.

56, 4, Severe depression,For the first week or so I experienced nausea and dizziness_ but that went away. My depression lifted within a few weeks. I could function again! I became much more social_ and I was able to focus on my studies.However_ I gained 20 pounds within two months. Yikes! After that_ the rate of weight gain slowed down to about 2-3 pounds more per month. The weight gain triggered binge/purge cycles_ and eventually I stopped taking it because I couldn't deal with the insatiable hunger. After I stopped taking it_ I became suicidal again.,The med made me gain weight_ but it totally helped my depression!!! That being said_ even AFTER I stopped the med_ I wasn't able to lose the weight I gained no matter how much I dieted or exercised.

It was as if I had been lifted out of my funk for the first time in quite some time.   I recommend this drug.   As far as the weight gain everyone complains about_ I have a solution:  Do not eat so much.  This medication cannot cause you to gain weight per se; consuming more calories can_ however.   You must monitor what you eat_ and you must exercise.   Besides_ doing  so_ along with drinking plenty of water will_ I believe_ mitigate any other unwanted side effects.,,M,47,6  months5mg 1X D,4/14/2015,Abilify

I feel like I'm dying_ I have informed 3 people I have Ebola _ just no bleeding out of main orifices yet.....(just a sad joke people_ calm down).  My head is in crushing pain_ I'm dizzy_ I cannot do anything but want to sleep. I have a 3 year old I can barely take care of today- taking every ounce of strength I have- no I'm not neglecting her_ but I'm damn sure not a bucket of sunshine. Crying jags_ extreme lethargy_ did I mention the physical pain? Shakes throughout body- constant. Cold spells mixed with hot flashes_ etc. you get the idea. It's not for everyone. And why in the hell would my doc put me on something that costs $800/mo with no insurance?!I have samples- and they will remain intact. I'm on a regular dose of Zoloft (200mg) for my mental issues- this was supposed to amplify. No no Abilify- you are amplifying the incorrect issues.  Great for constipation_ if I'm awake and not in fetal position wishing I were dead_ I'm in the bathroom shitting my guts out. I hope this helps others.

Weight loss,I took his drug because I have been on 150 mgs of sertraline for OCD and depression and it just didn't work.  I have taken risperidone before and it was successful_ so wanted to try Abilify as it is the one least likely to put on weight.  Felt awful to begin with and that was only on 2.5 mgs_ so people that go straight on to 10mgs must feel terrible.  In time though the sickness and tiredness has gone and I feel much better.  The horrible OCD thoughts are gone or a lot more distant and I feel less depressed.  If you take it in addition to an antidepressant I would recommend starting on a low dose_ due to the side effects.  Even though I have felt more hungry_ I have found it easier to lose weight.  I take it at night_ because the hunger seems worse shortly after taking it_ so now I don't notice much change to my appetite.,F,33,10  days2.5 1X D,10/10/2014Email,Abilify

Anyway I stopped the Domperidone because it wasn't doing what it was supposed to_ and these side effects continued. I finally ended up at a neurologist's office about it and was told that basically I was probably always predisposed to those side effects from Abilify_ but it was the other medication combined with it that brought those side effects out.

166, 4, Bi Polar II_ Depression_ Paranoia,,I needed to update my review for Abilify. I decided to try it again since I had great luck with it my first week of taking it last time. I did some research and talked to my doctor about taking it in really small doses since I'm really sensitive to medication and he was fine with it. So I got a pill cutter and carefully divided it into 8ths. By taking only an 8th at night_ I had a great reduction in my depression. My only side effect has been a little bit of inner tension and some grogginess which only lasted the first week. My belief is that a big portion of the negative reviews on Abilify were those from people who had taken too much to begin with and couldn't take the side effects. I highly recommend talking to your doctor about taking it in small doses. Another positive is_ for the first time in years I can drink caffeine with out getting anxiety. I've also noticed that I want to get out more and be social. One more thing to add_ by taking it in this small of dose I'm not getting any intense food or carb cravings_ in fact I think I am hungry less than before I started taking it. I'll see if that reflects on the scale.,M,36, .25mg 1X D,10/13/2012EmailHistory,Abilify

196, 4, bipolar II,weight gain,I have mixed feelings about abilify.  Since going off of it several weeks ago I have lost 20 pounds and feel better about that.  It did keep me stable if not a bit on the depressed end of things.  I will probably go back on it if my strange symptoms return like anxiety or what I call brain fog.   Was worried about getting diabetes from it and the effect it was having on my lipids.  As far as any withdrawal symptoms I have not noticed anything really bad other than feeling a bit run down.  I did taper off of it and was on a low dose to begin with but am watching for withdrawal symptoms closely.  I guess I am taking it one day at a time.  I did notice an odd eye blinking thing and people were asking me what was wrong with my eyes.  A bit concerned about tartive symptoms as well since I have read that they can manifest after discontinuing an anti-psychotic.

The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.,M,28,2  months5 mg 1X D,9/10/2011,Abilify
235, 4, bipolar depression,I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.,It started working within a week or two_ lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.,insomnia_ flat feeling_ tired in AM_ my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep_ loss of motivation_ hunger in the morning_ increases my prolactin_ does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

239, 2, Anxiety problems,I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people),I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.,M,43, 60 2X D,8/21/2011Email,Abilify
240, 5, bi polar I,Increased cholesterol_ weight gain_ severe food cravings.,"I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me ""the most normal I've ever been"" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately_ no matter how healthfully I ate_ my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.

It did make me feel more ""alive"" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately_ the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels_ they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify.

It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts_ crying jags_ and irritability)_ but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything_ including reading of any kind. Still_ my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy_ basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct_ as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there_ I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy_ BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression_ but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant_ yes_ but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it_ which is what Abilify did to me.,F,19,2  months2.5-20 1X D,12/30/2010,Abilify

Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder_ I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify_ given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months_ I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias_ however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed_ since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2"") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010_ I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide_ and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug_ and I can get back on track in life.

It helped after about two months_ with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day_ then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad_ just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.

It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.,Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.,F,42,30  days10 mg 1X D,11/5/2010,Abilify
285, 1, Psychotic & Manic Depression,Dystonia_ arrhythmia.,I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment_ but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse_ then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.,F,20,1  months 1X D,10/29/2010,Abilify
286, 1, Major Depression_ PTSD,Weight gain_ insomnia_ tremors_ muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?),I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and_ at that time_ had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue_ although lessening_ 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it_ because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very_ very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression_ but for me_ the cost in negative side effects was much too high.,M,65,3  days2.5 mg 1X D,10/26/2010Email,Abilify

288, 5, major depression/gen. anxiety,None.,I actually take Abilify alone_ I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug_ although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.,F,24,2  years10 1X D,10/20/2010,Abilify
289, 3, to improve control of bipolar 2,Gained about 25 pounds_ borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.,Abilify worked very_ very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away_ but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life_ I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However_ I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing_ and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing_ so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough_ but diabetes_ obesity_ and unemployment are rough_ too.,F,54,2  years2.5 mg 1X D,10/13/2010,Abilify

At 30mgs_ I noticed the buzzing sensations_ and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower_ I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro_ and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was_ it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify_ the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting_ but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify_ and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety_ however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd_ possibly anafranil.,F,26,9  years30 MG 1X D,9/23/2010History,Abilify

If you feel very restless or anxious_ you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it.

The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues_ even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally_ I felt energized_ I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer_ so I went back to the Invega.

If you get through the initial crappy side-effects_ it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even_ very balanced.

307, 5, Major Depression_ GAD_ PTSD,Side effects: rapid weight gain_ severe constipation_ extreme hunger,I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result_ I became agressive_ anxious_ more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However_ my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent_ agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg_ then 30 mg. I am back to a normal_ active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works.

There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal_ 20 mg of abilify_ 30 mg Buspar_ and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.,I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.

This went away after the second dose_ but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days_ my vision was so blurry_ I had to stop taking it. In addition_ it made my insomnia worse_ and after stopping the drug_ I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia_ which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify_ it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.,F,55,5  days2mg 1X D,7/23/2010,Abilify
314, 4, Severe Depression/Psychosis,Akathisia_ Irritability_ breathing difficulty_ urine retention_ lethargy,I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled_ I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia_ the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it.

Absolutely debilitating_ suicidal_ etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now_ not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day_ do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.

I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time_however_the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason_I began to dread any and most all social engagements_I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive_my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time_ I was also taking prozac_wellbutrin_topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it_(and it hasn't been very long)_I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process_my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion_I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.,F,46,5  years10mg 1X D,6/29/2010Email,Abilify

After being on this for so long_ my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver_ so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad_ it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.,Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress_ and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even_ but now I have liver problems.

This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless_ but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad_ I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify.

I didn't know what he meant by that at the time_ but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book ""Cancer: Step Outside the Box"" by Ty Bollinger_ can be found on Amazon.com.The term ""mad as a hatter"" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression_ shaky hands_ etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.",M,39,1  years5mg 1X D,2/25/2010Email,Abilify

372, 3, Schizophrenia_ anxiety,Severe hiccups_ dry heaving_ nausea_ sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg_ so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse_ lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate_ drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer_ practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this_ I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med_ the worst thing about this is that it brings,I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).

I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them_ I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something_ a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med_ I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of ""flat.""

At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.,When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll_ focus_ attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying.

Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.)

I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD_ but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity_ aggression_ and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love_ however_ if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.

I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said_ I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small.

I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me_ the abilify took that away from me.

BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter_ older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms_ waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function_ because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight.

Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours_ then it started to go away. I wasn't hot_ I even cranked up the air conditioner_ didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep_ which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it_ and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me,F,32,1  days,8/2/2009,Abilify
433, 5, major depression/Bipolar,None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem,A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works_ try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.,M,49,60  days,7/31/2009,Abilify
434, 1, Bipolar Disorder,Weight Gain,I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later_ and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone_ the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.,F,22,6  months,7/27/2009,Abilify
435, 5, schizo personality disorder,"I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the ""dones"" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.",This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.,M,29,6  years,7/23/2009,Abilify

437, 1, major life long depression,I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend_ on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up_ that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday_ I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion_ I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils_ my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write_ was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday_ he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist_ who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks_ he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo,I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse_ I wasn't paralyzed!

Abilify was prescribed to me because my initial diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. The two disorders are somewhat similar.  Abilify has more or less completely eliminated my psychotic symptoms and I do well on this medication.  I have not experienced any negative side effects in the past 2 years.  For the first 6 months I had restless legs and some fidgeting problems where it was hard to sit still.  Those symptoms passed and I feel pretty much fine at this point.

I found myself taking too many sleeping pills (and i never take sleeping pills) to counteract the movement so that i could fall asleep. This medicine should be used as a torture technique!!. The the doctor gave me sleep meds_ and blood pressure medication to help with the Abilify side effects.(the blood pressure meds were supposed to make me stop moving...) So she had me on three medications! (NOt to mention this medicine is extremely overpriced!) You couldn'tpay me to take this medicine again. I am on Lamictal 25mg (a very low dose) and its a miracle.

Resperidol made me gain a lot of weight quickly. And Haldol was abominabal - I ate constanly and got ridid muscles_ but that was also from all the anti-psychotics I tried. The key for me was finding the right DOSAGE_ which was much lower than my doctor put me on originally. 5mg Abilify was just right_ but I've been gaining more and more weight over the years and want to go off it due to this serious problem. It did however_ protect me from the spirit invasion or what others call ""voices"" or ""hallucinations"". The risk of psychosis is one problem by going off of it_ but so is diabetes and obesity_ as well as other side effects from staying on it. I have weighed the consequences and made my choice.

The change is almost as if she is a different kid. She went from extreme  mania episodes that cycled at times within minutes. To near stable in her moods in just days after beginning this medication. Her doctor wants to change her to Geodon due to the weight gain. Weight was never an issue for her until she started taking Abilify. But I think with the improvement in her mental stability a little weight gain is not that significant. I love this medication. She was on 5mg per day up to 7.5 per day after 2 months. It's effectiveness wore off at about 2 months in. No problems since upped to 7.5mg a day. She has no trouble sleeping.

I took Abilify before I want to bed.  I have tried almost every dose: 30mg_ 20mg_ 10mg_ 5mg and 2mg.

485, 3, Resistant Depression/Anxiety,15 lbs weight gain.  Restlessness.  Chronic insomnia.  Night binging (and subsequent purging to curb weight gain).,Ironically_ this drug (5 mg to 2 mg with 150 mg of Wellbutrin XR and 20 mg of Adderral XR) helped my self-confidence in social situations by minimizing my anxiety and shutting off my self-critic -- despite shattering my self-image (as a result of relentless weight gain).  At my best_ I didn't care.  I shopped nonstop -- because I was constantly gaining weight (in reality) and my clothes no longer fit me.  In my case_ my doctor did not listen to my threshold for weight gain.  In two years_ I gained 20 lbs with various antidepressants.  Desperate to gain some resemblance of myself back_ I began purging.  In the eight months that I have been (on/off) the Abilify_ I have vacillated from hypomanic (on) to hopelessly depressed (off).  In fact_ the spiraling phase upon quitting the drug (without compliance) has translated to increased anxiety (and dependence on Xanax) and debilitating depression. I do not recommend this drug to young women whose self-image is inextricably related to their appearance in anyway.,F,33,8  months,4/1/2009,Abilify
486, 3, Depression,Speedy manic feeling_ shakiness_ feeling like I couldn't sit still_ a little nausea in the beginning_ craving for sweets at night_ WEIGHT GAIN.,I was already taking Prozac for depression but still having depression symptoms_ so the Dr. prescribed Abilify to supplement the Prozac. In the beginning_ this medicine really helped to pull me out of the funk that I was in.  I felt energized_ productive_ and like my overall attitude was very much improved.  After a couple or 3 weeks_ however_ I noticed that I was gaining weight at an alarming rate.  In the 2 months that I took this drug_ (at a low dose of 1mg/day) I gained over 15 lbs!  I also felt strangely like shopping and spending money all of the time_ almost like I was having a manic episode. All in all_ I felt much less depressed_ but stopped taking for fear of becoming REALLY overweight. Note: after I stopped this drug_ I felt more depressed than ever and almost suicidal.  If you stop_ you should probably taper off gradually!,F,45,2  months,3/29/2009Email,Abilify

The first side effect involved swelling of my parotid gland. This is a salivary gland that is located just in front of your ear and near the upper jaw. The day after I noticed this side effect_ I began to experience acne-like clusters on my forehead and scalp. I'm usually pimple free_ so the abilify seemed to be the likely cause.,Due to the side effects mentioned_ I discontinued use. This was disappointing because the medication did seem to lessen my depression and it helped me increase energy and concentration.,F,47,10  weeks,10/14/2008,Abilify

Then two months into the regime severe acne broke out on my face.  7 months later and I'm still dealing with it.  The side affects aside I did have some unexpected results that I really liked.  Although I wasn't taking the medication for my ADHD I found while on the medication I was extremely punctual and capable of tearing myself away from something I was focusing intensly on.  I've been off the medication for several months now and have gone back to being chronically late and having periods of hyperfocus where I can't do anything else but the task in front of me.  I wouldn't take it again_ but some of the results were very impressive.,F,24,3  months,10/11/2008,Abilify

I'm only on 5 mg_ but I'm also on Klonopin and Lamictal_ so it may be a mixture of the three that's causing this.  I was really surprised with the loss of appetite.

I was so scared_ I thought the pain wouldn't ever end. It took weeks after getting off it before the restlessness stopped. It was scary.,The most frightening pill ever.

Abilify made my arms and legs feel like they had to constantly be moving and it felt so uncomfortable sitting still or laying down_ I felt constantly restless. It was extremely terrifying and I was young and hadn't known the side effects the pill would give me. I was so scared the restlessness and pain was going to last forever.

I would of rather taken a bullet to the head than deal with that feeling ever again.,It was difficult to tell whether it helped with my mood since I cycle so frequently.  I was in a good mood while I was taking it.  The side effects didn't start till I was upped from 5/mg to 10.  After that I was on 10 for approx 3 days when it started.

He became extremely restless and he would pace and not be able to sit still for more than 8 minutes at a time. His lying and disrespect intensified.

He complains about a little pain_ I am thinking muscle pain_ he has had a sore inside his cheek that we treated with clove oil and hydrogen peroxide (went away)_ he has been a little sad on this med_ a little whiny_ but considering all he has been through_ it seems like he is finally able to feel emotions whereas before he seemed very out of touch with reality and non-emotional (his dad abandoned him and we are in the middle of divorce_ and my son has hardly registered emotionally_ which might have been a blessing in disguise all this time_ and I think part of his whininess is just his ability to finally feel the things he had not been able to feel before).,Now the good stuff_ we tried this med first (physician sample)_ then Risperdal (actual prescription). The Risperdal had no effect on him_ he was still racing around like a lunatic_ and after seeing him on this drug_ we decided this drug was far better. He can focus at school_ listens to the teacher_ was able to be included in his school Christmas pageant_ the violence against others (classmates_ his dad_ myself) has stopped_ and he is able to sit still for long periods_ complete class work and homework_ no longer destroys the house like he did before_ the school is considering allowing him to rejoin his classmates in social activities (recess and PE_ which he was held out of for most of the school year because of fighting and violence)_ and this saved him from being suspended for the second time.

It had greatly reduced my obsessive and intrusive thoughts but now it's just an annoyance. Most of my meds_ including this one_ have slowed down my entire body (thinking_ reaction time_ speech_ etc.) which is the reason I have a learning disability. I'm SO tired! I do have sleep apnea but abilify just makes it worse. Tardive dyskinesia is a problem_ too (involuntary movements such as: grimacing_ tongue protrusion_ rapid eye blinking_ finger movements as if playing a guitar or piano_ etc.) Tardive dyskinesia happens with antipsychotics like abilify and I do every single thing I listed there.

658, 3, schizo/bipolar/depression,This medicince by far is the most effective when treating symptomsit has low impact on weight gain.  i recommend this drug if you have experienced weight gain with other anti physcotics such as seroquel and  zyprexa_ i believe those drugs are linked to DIABETES_ WEIGHT GAIN_ and OVER EATING AND UNCONTROLLABLE HUNGER the dosing is very easy with abilify starting dose 15mg and that is the recommended dose you stay on according to my shrink abilify has not been found affective at higher does due to extreme side effects,this medicine made my eyes roll in back of my head once,M,32,14  years,5/14/2007,Abilify
659, 4, bipolar 1 disorder/mood instability,extreme tiredness_ upset stomach_ blurred vision_ cold sweats_ tremors (uncontrollable shaking) in hands.,I have been on and off this medication for 4 years and today is my first day back on it in 8 months. I feel very ill but I remember from all my past experiences that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to and to respond(I just want to make that clear to the people that quit taking it after one day). I am taking 15mg but I'm pretty sure I'm going to start cutting my pill in half to lessen the side effects. Abilify has been highly effective in treating my irritability and mood swings_ making me a pleasure_ rather than a monster_ to be around. Personally_ I would rather have an upset stomach for a few days and be happy than to be constantly angry for the rest of my life. I took abilify with effexor a few years back and it sent me to the ER because I was shaking so badly I couldn't stand up. I am told it is dangerous to mix abilify with anything. Hopefully the side effects go away soon!,F,19,4  years,5/1/2007Email,Abilify
660, 5, bipolar/schizo-affectiver,As I went slowly up from 2.5mg to 15mg_- I experienced poor night vision;loud noises startled me at night;muscular aches and pains; always want to eat; tired all day but can't sleep through the night; restless_ but tired.  Agitation_ anger and anxiety came back if I didn't increase my dosage in about 4days.  I just began 15mg today. DR. said may go all the way to 30mg if we need to in the future.,Now_ the good stuff--I'm calmer around people.  My anger is much reduced.  Oversensitivity is reduced. I'm able to cope with daily frustrations.  I'm no longer so irritable and impatient with people.  General anxiety_ and nervousness to be around people is gone.  Bipolar mood swings are completely minimized and I recover from any emotional upset faster.  AWESOME drug for me personally!,F,38,1  months,4/25/2007,Abilify
661, 4, bipolar depression,"weight gain (it was lithium's helper) spasming jaw_ chattering teeth_ tiredness_ ""wired_ but tired""",This drug has kept me from falling any deeper into depressions. Both times it has rescued me from hospitalizations.  However_ I do not like having to take two other drugs just so I can continue taking this one without the side effects.  Have to take cogentin and inderal both for the jaws and limb jerks.  Don't like that.,F,50,15  days,4/25/2007,Abilify

I never had these problems before I took Abilify.,I still have to have more blood tests to determine what is going on with the muscle and joint pain that I am experiencing.  I took 2.5 mgs. of Abilify for about a month and then felt like I was coming down with the flu.  It turns out that it was a rare side effect from this medicine_ so I stopped taking it.  I am still in pain and it has been over 2 months since my last dose.  I am convinced that whatever my blood work says that I have it came from taking this medicine.,F,44,30  days,4/23/2007Email,Abilify

I was feeling really sick_ no drug made me fell that way,I took this medicine just for 1 day_ and it was enough for me to decide that I wasn't taking it anymore. I was feeling really sick_ just the same as when I was pregnant and having severe toxicosis _ no drug made me fell that way. I'm going back to Depakote.,F,21,1  days,4/10/2007,Abilify
666, 2, schizoaffective_ bipolar type,About three weeks after I started taking it_ my entire body started gradually swelling up like a balloon_ and I had this uncontrollable_ horrible burning sensation in my legs and ankles. It got to the point where the swelling was so bad that I could barely move. I couldn't button my shirts anymore_ my feet wouldn't fit into my shoes_ and I had to go up a whole bra size (band AND cup). I found out_ though_ that only about two percent of the subjects in the clinical trials had this problem (and it's often an allergic reaction)_ so I must be special. ;-} Oddly enough_ when I went off this_ I got onto Risperdal_ only to have the exact same reaction.,I was REALLY disappointed that my reaction was so bad_ because it otherwise worked very well. I felt better than I could remember feeling in about 20 years. My mood swings went from every several minutes to ... not at ALL. I felt stable for the first time in a VERY long time_ like I was finally on solid ground. The really WEIRD thing_ though_ was that for the first four days_ I couldn't feel ANYTHING -- it was like someone had flipped a switch inside me and turned me off. After that_ it took about another week to level out completely_ but once I did_ I felt GREAT.,F,28,5  weeks,4/5/2007Email,Abilify
667, 4, bi p[olar disorder,Tired. Very tired at first; now I don't even notice unless I stop taking it...then I'm a real c*nt to deal with and I am very irritable and angry.,When I started taking Abilify with Zoloft_ I was very tired all day.  I felt like I had a wet blanket wrapped around my head_ then they lessened the dose to 5 mg a day_ and I'm fine.  It's subtle_ I can't tell any effect at all from it unless I stop taking it.  Then it is like an immediate PMS.,F,37,1  years,4/1/2007Email,Abilify
668, 1, bi polar disorder,"Started out on 5mg daily and over a period of 2 months was ""upped"" to 20mg.  By the middle of the third month_ I developed the most horrible feeling_ like wanting to jump out of my own skin_ could NOT get comfortable_ caused restless leg syndrome to go totally bonkers_ made me pace and feel horribly panicky ALL THE TIME!  I had never in my life felt such an awful feeling!  Raging insomnia accompanied the whole ordeal_ as well as vision trouble_ completely unable to write a sentence or write my own name_ for that matter due to hand tremors (which I still have sometimes to this day)_ constant feeling that the ""dying to get out of my own skin or run screaming like a madwoman"" feeling would NEVER go away.  It finally did_ but golly did it ever take time.  That's the only thing that will help with the akathisia (acathesia)...time.  It took the same amount of time that I was on the drug_ about 3 and a half months_ for the feeling to finally start going away.",In all honesty_ through bi polar disorder_ obsessive-compulsive disorder_ severe panic disorder_ visual and auditory psychosis at times_ depression_ etc._ the ONLY time I ever truly even considered suicide was during the akathisia (acathesia) ordeal I went through_ all due to the Abilify.  You don't know what utter hell and torment is until you've gone through the nightmare of akathesia_ which for me was completely due to taking Abilify!  If it works for you_ great_ but be warned...try to stay on the smallest dosage that works for you...upping the dosage over a period of time can have this horrible effect on you too and I wouldn't wish the feeling Abilify caused me on my worst enemy!,F,44,3.5  months,3/29/2007Email,Abilify

670, 5, BP 1/possible schizoaffective/PTSD,vertigo_(room tumbling end over end) one episode lasted two days_ the other lasted one week_ other than that no side effects. cannot be certain this medicine was to blame,abilfy helped me come down out of the sky_ gave me very crisp feelings and perceptions of reality.  It dimmed out the white noise in my head_ and for the very first time i can remember felt no noise in my head_ just peacefulness.  Being numb from years of emotional shutdown_ i actually had feelings surface for the first time_ and had to start sorting through them and dealing with them.  sometimes it was painful at first because the pain was acute_ but Id much rather feel now than be numb.  Ativan in combination helps deal with the tremendous anxiety.  Also take seroquel for sleep_ and lamictal for the depression.  Overall_ a good mix for me.  I would never want to go back to the worst moments of this illness before Dx and treatment_ and for that I am grateful.,F,37,17  months,3/25/2007,Abilify

I feel agitated but clear headed.  i will accept the trade-off but feel that I must do something about side-effect.  Benzo helps. I forsee weight gain because I am hungry again.,I am only in the first week_ but needed to speak of the progress I have made.  At just 5 mgs. I notice a substantial reduction in the chatter in my brain and I am better able to perceive and respond appropriately to social scenes_ leaving me less sacred of people.  Paranoia is under control. i have been on several meds in my 20 year struggle with bipolar 1/schizo. disorder.  i am just coming off a psychotic break that lasted very long on and off.  I am what they call a quick responder when a med works for me.  So far wellbutrin (which i still take) Lamictal (which was like a god-send and then pooped-out_ and now Abilify has improved drasticaly the picture in just 5 days.  Last night I could concentrate long enough to put a desk from Ikea together and I even cleaned my room.  Now i still have the memories of some terrible behavior and the knowlege of such negative poop-out tendencies of meds.  But for today I am grateful.  More later.  John. R.B.

672, 1, anti pyschotic_ not needed,this drug made me walk like a zombie_ slur my speech_ I couldn't use my hands and fingers - it was like I had a small stroke_ I couldn't lay or sit down - relaxing was very unconfortable_ very nervous_ loss of concentration.,I din't need anti-psychotics and was prescribed and administered them illegally.  I tried geodon_ respirdal_ and zyprexa too.  The abilify was by far the worst!  I was only taking 15mg._ and I still had horrendous side effects!  This is a terribly dangerous drug.  I see no worth in any anti-psychotic or anti-depressant drugs_ these drugs really mess with your mind and body. If you are having psychotic_ bi-polar_ depression_ or whatever_ and desire to take something.  Only take small dosages of anything_ 10mg. or less.  These drugs can cause more harm than the disease!,,41,18  days,3/12/2007,Abilify

He also experiences some muscular discomfort and dehydration.,We are currently weaning off of it.  He would rather deal with his symptoms then the side effects.  Doc has prescribed Luvox..hard to find info on it.  Not sure what we are going to do.  The abilify decreased his symptoms by about 90% on 10 mg. per day.,M,17,3  months,2/13/2007,Abilify

I am going to try to give up sugar and junk to see if the weight comes off.  I am also coming off the Dostinex too to see if it is effecting my weight. I really need the Abilify.

However_ I must add that I take Paxil as well.  However_ Paxil has never caused me any problems.my friend (same condition) also takes paxil and abilify.  both of us agreed that once we tried Abilify that mania was brought on.

680, 4, Autism and Tourettes Syndrome,I was on Abilify for about 5 years and then had to go off of it.  I lost a great deal of weight when I went off of it_ but my behaviors got worse. I could not think clearly. I recently went back on the Abilify and I have gained a great deal of weight in a very short period of time. Not happy about that.  Also_ my appetite has increased slightly_ and it makes me extremely tired.,This truly gets rid of tics (from Tourette's) and controls alot of the behaviors from Autism_ but the side effects are just awful. There really is no drug out there that works as well_ and that is a shame. Wish someone would develop a drug that didn't have so many side effects.,F,15, ,12/24/2006,Abilify

The weight gain could be a result of the Risperdal I was taking in combination with the Abilify_ not sure_  but stopped the Risperdal to see if I could lose a few pounds and remained stable on just the Ability (Don't tell my doctor). I have stopped gaining weight. I take the maximum dosage too_ 30 MG. ,Since I started taking Abilify_ I have the impetus to get up and out.  No other medication has had this effect. No delusions_ hallucinations_ voices or paranoia.  This is a great drug.,F,56,2  years,12/11/2006Email,Abilify
684, 2, Bipolar 2 hypomania,I cannot bear the side effects this drug has!  I Have no ability to THINK clearly on this med.  I am confused and retarded physically and mentally.  I am on disability_ thank God! The only reason I am taking it currently is becasue I have been RX'd large doses of Prednisone )or a physical problem I have)which within 2 days made me totally manic! As fun as feeling hypomanic is_ I didn't want to go over the top! So I reluctantly started taking abilify again during the steroidal treatment. I am in the taper down phase now of prednisone and abilify. I am looking forward to being on Trileptal alone again for treating my Bipolar disorder.,Since 1998 I had taken depakote and prozac_ but then after gaining 80 lbs_ I changed Doctors.  The new P-doc prx'd Abilify. I was unstable and had a lot of mixed states. I became all messed up---retarded_ confused_ irritable_ sleep problems_ inability to function in the medical field as a Sr. Veterinary Technician.  I needed meds to make me sleep and needed meds to wake me up...it was TERRIBLE.  My job performance was ridiculous.  The only reason I wasn't fired is that my boss and I had an understanding---and I was very very open about my BP. My Pdoc kept tweaking up the abilify and I got worse and worse. Finally_ I decided he was a quack and I slowly tapered off ALL meds.  I became much better!  I was off meds for 18 mos before I cycled again and went back to the pdco to get treatment again.  I was relived he didn't force me to take abilify again until recently while I was taking steroids for another medical problem.  It knocks the heck out of any manic attack!

686, 3, bipolar diagnosis after 25 yr lupus,extreme weight gain combination of depekote and ablilify  and trazadone for sleep severe depression and then slight stroke eight years ago. Lupus flair ups causes pain and not able to sleep i do not think i should have to take ablify medication for all these years_ but want to decrease to 15 mg instead of 30 mg.  i went off the drug 18 months ago and ended up anxiety and panic striken and had to go to a week of health care around the clock to get back on medecine and then they added depekote because i was dizzy. during that stay at the help center i evened  out but they added a sleeping pill. I have no desire to do anything and if i let my mind get busy i start a lot of projects that make other family member crazy so it is best for me to  take several naps a day and stay calm. I eat compulsivley with out stopping to think about chewing and walk to the kithen to get a bite of food and would go back often if someone did not remind me not too.I do things in a hurry and shower half heart,has any one taken abilify as long as i have? over 2 years maybe three.and has any one mixed depekote that i have never had a seizure but they think this will control my bipolar actions. I think after my stroke and losing smell for 8 years.I visited a chiropractor last year and got my smell back_ made my life a little better.  But i also take plaqenell_ generic when my lupus flairs up and i have not had to take it the last three months. but someone said that they take celebrex for their lupus and i have always taken plaqeunell for the last 20 years when i have a flair up and i usually take it for three months untill symptoms subside. but i think when i went off the ablify on my own because of weight gain and being tired all the time is when it was really a bad week.  I was not rational at all and very anxious. enough that i wanted to go to institution and not ever come back home.  Said i would never go off the med again unless under a doctor that understood lupus and i was under 24,F,65,3  days,11/8/2006,Abilify
