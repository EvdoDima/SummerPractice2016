0, 4, Postherpetic neuralgia,None,As I drive a heavy vehicle I am limited in what drugs I can use to satisfy my employers drug policy. I have found this medication in conjunction with over the counter pain medication most satisfactory. The down side is my neuralgia is on my head and I need to keep my hair (luckily I don't have much) shorn to allow the patch to stick.

Pain meds did not work enough to make them worth taking and my stomach doesn't do well with them. I asked for something to give some relief. I was happy to be able to function better and be able to think about anything other than the pain. Used them 12 hrs on 12 hrs off and noticed pain returning a few hrs before able to reapply.

15, 3, RA_ Titanium Prosthesis L Humerus +,No side effects; I always use maximum # allowed/prescribed by my Rheumatologist; up to 3 - 10cm x 14cm 700mg patches transdermally; 12 hrs on_ 12 hrs off PRN for pain; they work for as long as they stick_ which isn't long; how do they make them stick for 12 hrs?; I've tried Micropore tape (& other tape)_ but it's too harsh on my skin; I've tried using alcohol on the the area first but it extends patch life an avg of 10-15 minutes; It's VERY FRUSTRATING! I have insurance_ but my co-pay for these is the highest level_ $65_ on top of $800 monthly insurance premium! So I *think* it's better than having to pay full price_ but it's still A LOT of $ when they have no sticky left only an hour or so after putting them on & then I'm left with a patch w/ almost 12 hrs of medicine on it that's useless because it won't stick anymore_ let alone for 12 hrs! If it last 2 hrs I'm thrilled even though I know it's not acceptable. I rely on the patches as part of my pain rescue plan_ along w/ oral meds. when I desperately need to take the edge off. I can't complain because I want to keep my script. While I REALLY wish they'd stick a full 12 hrs_ I also REALLY don't want my Dr to d/c my script. They don't work 12 hrs_ but for now 1-2 hrs is a Godsend with my meds! Maybe ENDO Pharma will read the reviews & make a change!  ;),,F,38,6  years3patch q24,7/11/2012Email,Lidoderm

19, 3, shoulder subluxation/bursitis,no side effects_ took tonight with a tylenol plus codeine #3 bc i had SEVERE pain. so it's hard to say just how well it is working on it's own but seems to be at best about the same as voltaren gel_ for me biofreeze is best as it numbs the area. (but biofreeze wears off fast _has a medicinal smell._ not easy to apply to my scapula area)  i think for my particular injury/problem these aren't the best solution....,mine seem to stick very well_ no problems there. and i like that the patches are large bc i have a large area to cover. didn't notice any side effects at all.,F,35,1  days3 patches 1X D,9/22/2011Email,Lidoderm
20, 5, Gout,None so far,I began experiencing the unimaginable pain of gout about 2 weeks ago.  The slightest touch of even the lightest sheet would cause what felt like lightning bolts discharging through my feet.  I became bed/couch ridden.  3 days ago my primary care doctor prescribed Lidoderm patches for pain management.  I can now stand and hobble about relatively pain free and unassisted.  I can now refocus my attention back to working with my specialist's efforts to reduce the effects of the glomerulonephritis which is the root cause of the gout.

Major problem though is accesssing the drug. Dr gave me more samples to hold me/having to cut in half-still okay with pain. Am recent retiree-have medicare/medex 2/bluecross medicare Rx-they denied even an appeal twice from my doctor.  What is with that?

22, 1, back pain,Have been using the lidoderm patch on and off when I can afford them for two year.  Have so much pain it was hard to recognize that it is the lidoderm patch that gives me strong headache and swelling in the head behind the ears.  Another pain med that is just not worth it.,Worked well at pain site_ but gives terrible headache and makes head swell behind the ears...very painful.

27, 5, Fibromyalgia,Nausea but am not sure the patches are the cause.,I have used Lidoderm 5% Lidocaine patches for many months. My firo. pain is in my arms and legs_ but mostly in my legs (nerve type of pain). I can go several days without using them_ or if I have a flare-up_ I have to use them daily. I cut the square into whatever size piece I need_ and use 3M Transpore tape otherwise they come off. I keep the un-used patch in a ziplock bag. We travel a lot_ so I take them on the airplane with me; I get through security by using small scissors. It's great when traveling. My biggest problem with the patch is timing. My legs will begin to hurt in the afternoon_ and because of the 12 hr. on and off time frame_ I have to take the patch off before I go to bed. I cannot live without this patch_ and I would recommend it to anyone!,F,57,11  months 1X AN,8/19/2010,Lidoderm
28, 5, Fractured vertebra,doesn't stay in place (medication in adhesive makes it less sticky as the meds run out); sometimes leaves odd_ medicinal taste in mouth.,This is my second stint on Lidoderm in a year.  I find it works VERY  well as an addition to painkillers--while they work on the inside_ Lidoderm works on the outside.  If it's too big_ cut it down to size.  If it won't stay in place_ either cover it with an ACE bandage_ put it someplace where it will be covered in clothing_ or use surgical tape.

30, 3, Sciatic nerve pain,I felt tired 30 minutes after putting on 1/2 patch_ but I was dealing with stressors then also_ so not sure if it was patch or the stressors that made me tired. No other effects experienced at this time. Unlike other reviewers_ I had no prob with  adheasion overnight so they may have rectified that problem_ but I did make sure prior to applying that I had no residual creams (biofreeze_ bengay_ lotion etc.) or body oils present on my skin by bathing and using alcohol prep.,I was able to sit for half an hour each time before having to stand to alleviate a dull aching pain that was excruciating 2 hours prior. As to whether improvement was due to patch or chiropractic manipulation therapy kicking in from the day before is unknown.

35, 5, Spasms/Fibromyalgia,To help them stick - clean area with alcohol prep pad or skin prep pad before applying.,These did not work for my lower back/disk problem but they do significantly help with my spasms/burning from fibromyalgia.

36, 4, pain c7-t1,Somewhat itchy skin for an hour after applying_ then some irritation around the edges of the patch towards 10 hours of wearing.,These really work for the muscle spasms I get along my shoulders_ and they go to work instantly. In some respects they do a better job than the oxycodone IR breakthrough pills I take (I'm taking 20mg oxycontin x 2 per day). But they are about $6 per patch without insurance. Also_ I really could use them for more than 12 hours at a clip. But no real side effects other than some minor skin irritation and the pain relief is remarkable.,F,53,10  days,2/5/2008,Lidoderm

38, 3, spinal nerve pain,When I tried samples of these from my doctor I noticed a slight headache after applying the first patch that went away within the hour. They also left my skin a little itchy if I wore them for the full 8 hours.,They do seem to help numb the pain right under the area where they are applied. Too bad I can't afford to purchase them because Medicare doesn't cover the cost.,F,46,10  days,7/25/2007,Lidoderm
39, 4, tarsal tunnel syndrome,Severe pain in wallet.,Really helps out - I'd use them every day if I could afford it.  However_ I can't.  Even with health insurance_ they are still 2.00 per patch.  Also_ it is horrible trying to keep them on a foot.,F,40,1  years,6/14/2007,Lidoderm
40, 4, C2-T1 Upper Neck Pain,No side effects noted.,Lidoderm works well. The patches are too large_ and as everyone else has alluded_ don't stick worth shit. Don't reuse the patch guys. It says right on the box not to do so and for good reason to. Re-using the patches causes more side-effects and does not distribute the medicine properly. 12 on 12 off. Also_ numbness is not a side effect. I've been on these for awhile and the skin is supposed to get numb and the denervation is normal_ it's not a side effect. It's been great for sleep_ but must be cut in half_ and taped on with surgical medical tape_ as someone else alluded to...doesn't that work great?! It's not a permanent solution_ but it certainly helps.,M,22,9  months,5/31/2007,Lidoderm
41, 5, knee pain from skiing accident,If I put on two new ones_ I woke up a bit groggy like a hangover with a light headache.  If I put on half new_ half previously used_ I'm totally fine in the morning.  The relief very much outwieghs the side effect.,"This has really changed my life.   I feel like I have my life back.  I couldn't sleep at night from the pain_ spending days home from work because I couldn't sit or stand without unbearable pain.  I cut them up in pieces and put them around my knees at night.  My dr is wonderful and reccomended keeping old ones and using them until I feel like they don't have any useful life in them (usually 2-3 times each).  Also_ if you cut the worn edges_ they stick better.  I can tolerate the pain during the day_ but sleeping was so difficult.  The relief while I sleep has helped my body heal_ giving me back the ability to be active and feel ""normal"" again.   I reccomend this to anyone who has chronic pain.  9 months of physical therapy did close to nothing for me.  The healing time at night alone has brought much better results.",F,27,6  months,5/11/2007,Lidoderm

43, 5, chronic back pain,very slight numbness that resolves after removing,When my back is hurting too much to sleep_ these patches relieve almost all my pain very quickly.

(I'm not rich) I used every nite for about 3 months. First thing that gave me major relief. I lived on drugs for last 8 years for the pain_developed hepatitis_ now the patch is all I use. But_ what they charge for this is to me..a scam. I did study and found the company that makes this had a lot of legal issues with how they package it etc.  So one nite I wear 5% ointment and next the patch. Sometime ..wheres that generic???  Wearing every nite is the best way to go...I just have to extend my box of 30 patches.,F,54,6  months,1/20/2007,Lidoderm

46, 4, Disc injuries in back and neck.,Hard to tell_ as I had other meds and surgeries while using lidoderm.  Possible faigue??,Quickly helped intense_ chronic neck and back pain.  Fantastic relief_ helped me function again_ exercise_ sleep.  I wonder if others have found it to contribute to fatigue or other symptoms?? Hard to tell. I prefer to wear them at night_ because on warm days they get sweaty.  I dont' apply right after a shower because my skin is more sensitive then.  I vary the areas_ as I have pain in more places than I can use patches_ so this minimizes skin irritations. I wonder if higher doses will be approved_ or leaving it on longer? I also wonder about re-using the old patches_ as they still have some medicine?,F,39,1  years,12/1/2006Email,Lidoderm
