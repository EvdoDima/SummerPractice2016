0, 5, colonoscopy prep,Bloating_ abdominal fullness_ slight nausea_ some chills,I got a rx for Zofran to help with the nausea that this solution can cause_ it helped a great deal. Adding lime and lemon juice to each glass and then pouring 2 oz. in a small cup_ really helped in drinking this solution. In addition_ I ate a lemon drop after each glass_ this was very helpful. Just drink one glass at a time. It is not that bad.,F,50,1  times4 Liters 1X O,6/3/2010Email,Trilyte
