3, 5, Liver Disease- (non-alcoholic),Mild Nausea if taken without food.,I was diagnosed with NALD and have been taking this for a year. I have improved greatly. My bowel movements are normal now as I had diarrhea before_ which caused dehydration. I had become jaundiced and couldn't walk. This drug saved me.,F,33,1  years550 2X D,3/30/2015Email,Xifaxan
4, 2, Hepatic Encephalopathy,Desired effects were multiple a.m. bowel movements_ resolution of suspected bacterial overgrowth of small intestine which was causing out of control blood sugars; undesired side effects: headaches_ bloating_ runny nose_ excessive phlegm and productive cough.,I was given this drug to treat hepatic encephalopathy due to liver failure. At first_ it was like a miracle drug because I was recently having blood sugar control problems_ when I am normally in tight control. This drug most likely resolved a bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine.  The brain fog I was suffering from also greatly improved_ but I am not sure if that was a result of the Xifaxan or the Lactulose I was concurrently prescribed. For six months I needed to blow my nose so often that the inside of my nose became raw_ cracked and bled from over-blowing_ and more concerning was a cough I developed that produced thick_ sticky phlegm_ which I thought was a result of a virus I had contracted. It finally occurred to me to try stopping taking the medication_ and_ after having suffered so long from the cough and sinus problems_ within 48 hours the symptoms have disappeared! I found information on WebMD (side effects of Xifaxan) that confirmed my  experience.  My insurance won't even pay for this drug and I was getting it free through a program offered by the drug's manufacturer.  I will not take this drug again unless absolutely necessary to clear up future bouts of hepatic encephalopathy.,F,53,6  months550 2X D,1/6/2013Email,Xifaxan
5, 4, SIBO,water retention,I've taken this drug 4 times for SIBO and it's worked well each time (although first time I took it worked better for some reason). Only real side effect I have is water retention. I've gained about 5-10 pounds each time I use this_ but it comes off within 72 hrs of stopping the med.,F,40,14  days550mg 3X D,2/21/2012,Xifaxan
6, 2, Central Serous Retinopathy,Has been found to help some people with CSR_ did not help me. Only side effect was hearing loss_ felt like I was under water. Side effect went away after stopping medication,,F,53,18  days200mg 1X D,1/9/2012,Xifaxan

8, 4, SIBO,bloating_ abdominal distension_ minor fatigue,I have been on rifaximin twice over the last 18 months for SIBO (bacterial overgrowth). The fist time I took it it worked wonders for me. I had a normal stool for the first time in 3 years and it worked fast (within 36 hours). The second time I took it the positive effects were not as pronounced_ although it did help. SIBO unfortunately_ tends to recur_ so repeat courses of rifaximin are common.Side effects were mainly abdominal bloating/distension (I also had this with the SIBO_ but on the drug I looked 6-7 months pregnant!). I also gained 6 pounds in a week (and I'm  pretty thin)_ but this all went away about 4-5 days after stopping the antibioic (maybe water retention?). I would give rifaximin 5 Stars for the first course_ but only 3 for the second (didn't help as much the 2nd time).,F,39,10  days400mg 3X D,1/21/2011,Xifaxan
