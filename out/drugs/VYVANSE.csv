0, 5, Weight loss,Weight loss_ dry mouth_ loss of appetite_ constant urination,My doctor prescribed Vyvanse to help me lose weight because adipex wasn't working.  He wanted me to try it before doing any kind of weight loss surgery . In the 2 months I've been taking it I've went from 405 to 370. Basically from walking at least 3 miles four  days a week and light weight lifting. First few days I had extreme dry mouth so I started drinking a gallon of water a day which explains the constant urination. No nausea_  no headaches or  muscle aches.  I'm way more focused at work and home. I take it once daily at 6am before I workout and I'm not sleepy until about 10pm.I've taken it as late as 3pm and was sleep by midnight.  Do not take with energy drinks because you'll have the crazy jitters. Do not drink alcohol while on this medication because Vyvanse speeds up your metabolism so it burns alcohol more quickly.  May sound like a good thing but you won't feel the effect of the alcohol and you tend to drink more to get drunk which can lead to alcohol poisoning. I'm a smoker and it does cause me to smoke more as well which is the only negative point in taking it.,M,34,2  months60,8/17/2016Email,Vyvanse
1, 4, Focus_ motivation and drive.,Ofcourse I had the usual loss of appetite_ weight loss_ migraine_ upper abdominal pain and Insomnia.  After a few months most started to fade away_ pretty much only the appetite is off_ but I have learned to force myself to eat.  I also smoke and notice since being on it my smoking habits have increased substantially.,Has been a great ride for me at work.  My motivation is high and I am always on task...I always feel the need to get something done.,M,32,7  months60,8/15/2016Email,Vyvanse

3, 3, ADD,Loss of apetite_ insomnia_ upset stomach_ general uncomfortable feeling_ slightly dizzy_ light anxiety.,Writing this at 5 am as I cannot fall asleep (went to bed at 1 am with no sleepiness at all which is very unusual). The most prominent side effects are the loss of apetite and insomnia. Felt physical and emotional discomfort when the medicine was wearing off after about 10 hours (took it at 9.30 am). Though I did feel like I was more awake and could focus better the first few hours_ I still had trouble getting started on things. It's only day 1 but I'm already discontinuing of my own accord in fear of weight loss and lack of sleep as I haven't heard of anyone having their side effects get better. Will talk to my doctor about this in a few days.,F,20,1  days30mg,7/14/2016,Vyvanse
4, 4, ADD/ADHD,Dry mouth_ sometimes slight euphoria_ slightly increased heartrate_ fuzzy mind at end of day_ slight dehydration_ sometimes insomnia,This med has done a lot to improve my life quality. It can both aggravate anxiety or decrease it (in my experience)_ which way it goes depends on my own behavior: if I stay alone_ it makes me asocial_ if I engage people_ it does wonders. It helps me taskmanage. The sideeffects are primarily somatic and depend on the stimulant properties of the drug_ while the benefit is social and improves my overall succes in life. I find it better than methylphendidate which I used before this.,M,26,8  months30-60MG,6/15/2016Email,Vyvanse
5, 3, EXTREME sleepiness.,Worst pounding migraine of my life. One moment I was fine_ and the next I was incompcitated due to the extreme throbbing pain on my crown_ both sides of my temples_ and my eyes. I was also sweating profusely. I threw up so many times_ I can't remember the number. I was soaked from head to toe in sweat within a matter of seconds. Please help! Anyone else experiencing this or did? Does it go away? Maybe to high of a dose?,It really helps me hold down a job_ other wise I have a sleep disorder similar to narcolepsy and never know when I will fall asleep. Whether it's at my desk at work_ or driving down the interstate! I am afraid to go of of it for this reason_ but the headache/migraine was the worst I've ever experienced. Please help! Any suggestions appreciated!,F,30,1  days70,6/11/2016Email,Vyvanse
6, 3, ADHD,Severely decreased appetite. Increased anxiety. Lack of emotion. Insomnia. Increased heart rate. Nausea. Dizziness. Weight loss.,I have depression and anxiety. This medicine kind of mutes my depression but it doesn't make it any better. I feel numb to emotion. Which is just as bad_ if not worse than_ being sad all the time. In addition to muting my depression_ it has made my anxiety worse. I always have a pit in my stomach feeling as if something is about to go wrong at any given moment. When I have anxiety_ I get nauseous and my heart rate increases_ which is also what I am experiencing. But my heart rate jumps to 115 from just walking across the room and I find myself out of breath. My resting heart rate on this medicine is about 95 and I'm in good shape so it should definitely be lower. This is also a problem because I love to work out. I forget to eat or sometimes I just don't want to eat because I am not the least bit hungry_ which_ once again_ is a problem because I love to work out and extreme workouts in 90 degree weather on an empty stomach is beyond unhealthy.,F,15,5  days15mg 1X D,6/10/2016,Vyvanse
7, 4, I go 90 miles an hour the wrong way,The only side effect I can't handle is it makes the top of my tail bone ache sooooo much it hurts so bad like in the muscle I almost don't take it,But it's been what I need to help me focus and complete tasks,F,34,4  months30,6/8/2016Email,Vyvanse
8, 1, Severe adhd my whole life.,Always tired but I don't wish to sleep. Severe appetite loss. I'm no longer happy. Anxiety and depression. Blurry vision and muscle aches. Tunnle vision and a lot of anger. I feel completely emotionless. Over the weekend when I don't use it I feel like a completely different person. I stoped taking it for 2 months and I gained 10 pounds.,It is hard for me to get past the side effects.,M,17,4  years30,6/6/2016,Vyvanse
9, 1, To help focus,No appetite_ bad headaches_ body aches_ dry mouth_ insomnia,Although I am not prescribed and do not recommend using without prescription_ it didn't work out for me as planned. I've tried it twice with the hopes of better results the second time around_ however it was the same exact thing. Did not help me focus whatsoever_ I felt completely normal as if I never even took it. I do feel a bit off like out-of-body feeling but nothing crazy. And the only other noticeable difference is that I don't realize how talkative I am_ all I want to do is talk to someone while on vyvanse. Other than that it does absolutely nothing but make me feel bad later on with the side effects.,F,17,2  days60 MG,5/30/2016,Vyvanse
10, 5, ADHD/Binge eating disorder,Insomnia_ dizziness_ euphoria_ decreased appetite_ weight loss (10 lbs),Vyvanse is a miracle drug. I was taking methylphenidate_ first Concerta that was so ineffective and made me drowsy and depressed_ after Ritalin that was ok and finally Biphentin that was actually a good medication but not as good as Vyvanse. I can focus so well_ have more energy_ better mood_ more motivation_ can do physical activity everyday. The best thing is the fat loss around the waist_ because I'm way more active_ my metabolism is faster_ and I stopped binge eating like carbs. The side effects only last a week or 2.,M,37,3  months60 mg 1X D,5/27/2016Email,Vyvanse
11, 4, For ADD,While taking Vyvanse all of a sudden I started hitting my head against the floor and swinging my arms around and it would look like I was having a seizure I went to the hospital and they couldn't figure out the reason till this day I don't know if it was too much.,,F,38,1  years60,5/24/2016Email,Vyvanse
12, 5, Adult ADD,a few for the first day and then none. This medication has been life changing for me. I obviously have had ADD all my life but my parents were told girls don't get ADD and I had behavioural problems.   I decided to seek help myself in my 50's as I could no longer deal with things. First I was given antidepressants.......did not work.   Wrote the ADD test and my new doctor said I scored off the chart.  I sleep about 4 hours a night if I am lucky and went through the sleeping pill hell.  I now take 30mg  vyvanse in the morning and 10 mg Ritalin at dinner as the vyvanse only lasts about 9 hours for me.  I am so calm and happy now. I can fall asleep on it.  I no longer fidget constantly and my mind is calm (no racing thoughts)  I feel.........so this is what normal people feel like!    My only regret is that I did not start it years earlier.,If being calm_ less impulsive_ being able to stay on task are side effects_ well I will take them.  My whole family has noticed a positive difference.  Yes my appetite has decreased but not a lot.  I could still eat all day_ I now just have the willpower to say STOP.  I love that I have much more impulse control in all areas of my life.,F,56,10  days30 1X D,5/20/2016Email,Vyvanse

15, 4, Add,It help a bunch with school_ but I play football. And when we have practice I don't have any excitement. I feel as if I'm just going through the motions and don't have any drive to compete with my teammates. I feel like have become less aggressive. I was 245lbs when I started vyvanse and I'm down to 215lbs I'm not fond of this excessive weight loss.,,M,16,6  months50mg,5/4/2016,Vyvanse
16, 4, Adhd,Loss of appetite _weight loss but when I don't take it I'm extra hungry _ dry mouth _ I urinate & poop 50 times a day while on this & I don't eat oR drink anything _ insomnia,I hate the dry mouth & binge eating when not on it but I can see a difference in school and work when I'm on it and the weight loss is a plus I just wish It didn't have those extra side effects & the trick to getting your sleep back is by taking the medication earlier in the day for ex I take mines at 7 am,F,17,2  years50 mg 1x D,3/28/2016,Vyvanse

18, 3, Impulsiveness_ ADHD_ eating habits,I experience intense stomach pains_ extreme headaches_ loss of appetite and appeal to foods_ not being able to fall asleep at night_ either being very positive or very lazy and not committed.,I don't entirely recommend it. Yes t helps with my ADHD but the side effects are no joke and can impact your day. It's hard to do normal everyday things when I can't move due to an upset stomach.,F,17,1  months60 MG,2/23/2016Email,Vyvanse
19, 3, ADHD and Aniexty,No side effects really! I feel a little calmer than when I took Adderrall 30 mgs twice a day years ago!! I notice that it doesn't really suppress my appetite! Like the Adderall did!!  I also take Effexor XR 150 mg for aniexty!!,,F,52,3  weeks40mg,2/17/2016Email,Vyvanse
20, 3, Over eating,It lasts between 6-7hours_ when it wears off. I eat nonstop.,I was hoping the dosage would last a little longer_because when it wears off_ you'll feel the hunger coming back_ or if there's such thing as a booster.,F,37,1  days40,2/15/2016Email,Vyvanse
21, 3, ADD,Attitude change_ irritability headaches_ jitteriness_ weight loss_ appetite suppression_ dry mouth_ increased heart rate_,I was diagnosed with ADD in high school but was never medicated. In college I decided to try ADD medications to help me with schoolwork and time management. Vyvanse has helped me to focus and get things done but within 2 weeks of starting it I lost 10 pounds. I found that this worked better than concerta but that TRULY NEITHER WERE WORTH TAKING. I was prescribed concerta first and took it for 6 months. I had a lot of side effects with concerta and decided to try vyvanse to see if I would have less side effects. For the first few weeks I noticeably thought vyvanse worked a lot better. Then I started to see similar if not worse side effects. My mood and attitude completely changed on vyvanse. At first I didn't notice but my family_ my boyfriend_ and my friends did. I'm normally a outgoing_ loving_ devoted_ goofy_ and charismatic. However on Vyvanse I am jittery_ awkward_ emotionless_ uncaring_ unfriendly_ irritable_ and even aggressive. Not only does it change my attitude I can feel myself coming down off of it at night. Not to mention I get constant headaches_ to the point were every morning I take tylenol with it and at night I take tylenol pm to help me sleep. On the weekends when I don't take vyvanse I'm back to myself except I'm so sleepy and groggy that I can hardly function. Overall Vyvanse and Concerta are not worth taking; I find a positive attitude_ work ethic_ and adapting ADD by myself is a much healthier and happier option for me and everyone I am around.,F,21,3  months30mg 1X D,2/14/2016Email,Vyvanse
22, 4, ADD,No appetite at all for hours on end_ insomnia_ weight loss,It's the best ADD medication I've experimented with for school/studying. (With a presciption of course) I would stay on it but I have a really hard time eating on it_ but I also do remember the dose being too high for me. It was also my starting dose as well.,F,18,1  months60mg,2/4/2016,Vyvanse
23, 4, ADHD,Loss of appetite_ happier mood_ euphoria (starting about 15 minutes after I take the pill lasting for about a half hour)_ increased confidence_ increased sweating_ teeth clenching,This medication is not only good for ADD/ADHD_ but also for depression. I never thought I could be as happy as I am while the dose of Vyvanse is active. I'm much friendlier_ more confident_ and less irritable. I take it on days I have school (Monday-Thursday) and not on the weekends. Watch out for the crash_ it makes me pretty tired and burned out. Don't take it if you have plans for later in the night.,M,22,120  days70 1X D,2/3/2016,Vyvanse
24, 1, step mom thought I had ADHD,I didn't even know my own name had the worst withdraw symptoms I have ever had. Caused me to find out recently that because of my miss diagnosis I can now never have children because my body became severely under developed. I weighed a grand total of 83 pounds and looked like a dead person walking. I would never reccomend this to anyone giving this to your child may kill them in the long run parents. Or even better you may never get grand babies. This is the worst drug created it goes hand in hand with adderall XR. Please I beg of you use common sense when dealing with kids you can screw thier lives up forever !!!

26, 2, Binge Eating,This stuff makes me so jittery and I cannot stop cracking my thumbs and chewing on the inside of lips. My joints feel so stiff and achy. Instead of helping me control my binge eating_ it has made me binge even worse and gain 15 pounds since I started taking it a few months ago. I think the stuff makes me so jittery and nervous that I am constantly eating to calm my nerves or something. At one point my doctor increased my dose to 60 mg thinking maybe I just needed a higher dose. I was a wreck on 60 mg! I felt so sick to my stomach_ paranoid_ wired and exhausted at the same time. Terrible headaches with Vyvanse as well_ though this side effect seemed to improve after about 6 weeks. I am definitely going to try something different because this is not worth it.,,F,39,3  months40,1/18/2016Email,Vyvanse
27, 4, BINGE EATING DISORDER,better concentration_ suppress appetite for a little a few hours after taking it but it wears off.,It definitely helps my urges to binge_ but it doesn't cure it_ but i hope it will continue to do its work as i work to stop binge eating with therapy and trying to break the habit. It also makes me less anxious and my thoughts clearer but its not like magic I still have to work hard.,F,19,2  months50 1X D,12/20/2015,Vyvanse
28, 1, ADD,High sexual drive to the point of excessive compulsion and addictive behaviors. Living out fantasies when alcohol of any amount even cooked was taken in.,Get off it slowly and with help from a real doctor and not a psychiatrist. Go to theroadback.com and get on their supplements they helped with the side effects and it took me a year and a half to get the drugs out of my system even with this program.,M,36,4  years70,12/17/2015Email,Vyvanse
29, 1, Adult add,I'm doing this review on behalf of my gf. She takes 40mg almost daily during the school year.All summer she stopped taking it_ because she's a pt grad student and didn't need it. However as soon as school started and she began her medication she changed in many negative ways. First off she went from being a fun loving_laid back person to being on edge all the time. But at the same time emotionless. I thought it was stress from school. But when she doesn't take it on occasional weekends when she's not studying I get the woman I love back. So it's the drug. It has made her someone I don't much enjoy being around. When I brought up the fact that she'd been acting different_ like an emotionless zombie_ when she takes it. She claimed to not know the difference. Me and this girl are/were so madly in love. We would always get compliments like you two are so cute it hurts my heart_ or the way you two look at eachother makes me feel happy. But now shes taking f* vyvanse every day and is just not the same. And its a shame because I love her so much. I understand that she's fully invested in grad school_ but I wish I could get the old C***** back.,F*** this drug. It's evil. It changes people and makes them cold and heartless.,F,23,4  years40mg,12/7/2015,Vyvanse
30, 1, Adhd,My heart is pounding uncontrollably fast. It will stop if I lye still for about 10mins but if I even move an inch it starts right back up. It is pounding so badly_ it's feels like my chest is thudding. It's so bad it thuds all the way to my throat. So uncomfortable!! You can literally see how it is pounding when you look at my chest! What can I do or take so it will stop. Or even slow down_ someone please help!!! This is soo uncomfortable,,F,25,1  days40,12/4/2015Email,Vyvanse
31, 1, ADHD,Racing heart_ extreme anxiety_ overall uncomfortable feeling_ loss of appetite,I had previously been diagnosed with anxiety. After starting Vyvanse_ my anxiety skyrocketed. It was horrible. I noticed very little change in attention_ and at the end of the day_ it would wear off. As a college student_ I need to be on top of my game all of the time_ and that just wasn't happening with Vyvanse. I had symptoms from day one_ so I gave it a week_ but I just couldn't deal with the anxiety. I would not recommend Vyvanse or any stimulant ADD/ADHD medication if you have anxiety or if you need to be focused on a regular basis.,F,19,1  weeks25 mg,11/25/2015,Vyvanse

33, 2, adhd,This seemed to help my depression almost immediately_ but it did nothing g to help my focus.it gave me a little but more energy_ and loss of appetite_ dry mouth and irritability so bad. After five months of dealing with extreme uti's and yeast infection_ like I've never had in my life_ I finally narrowed it down to the vyvanse. I stopped taking it for a week_ and everything started clearing up. Then_ I started to take it_ and sure enough within 3 days_it was all back! I was peeing blood_ and had terrible pain during sex. I felt horrible!! Monistat would clear it up for a day or two_ then it would all come back again. It felt like my vaginal was also shrinking_ and not in a good way! Count in the chest pains_ and racing heart_ high blood pressure. This is not worth it!,,F,36,6  months50mg,11/10/2015Email,Vyvanse
34, 5, ADD,Fast speech. Racing thoughts. Loss of appetite. Extreme withdrawal side-effects.,Life changing medication. Helped many focus issues and greatly improved depression (although was not prescribed for that). Withdrawal at 75mg was severe and began within 5 hours after the time i normally take it. 50mg withdrawal is not as bad but still incapacitating.,M,25,8  years50 1X D,11/2/2015,Vyvanse

36, 1, ADHD,Vyvanse (Lidexamfetamine) is a potent neurotoxin that destroys the brains dopamine neurons and increases the risk of parkinsons disease and other dopamine related disorders in later life. Dexamphetamine (Active substance in Vyvanse) is the most reliable model of inducing permanent brain changes reminiscent of paranoid schizophrenia in animal models. Giving dexamfetamine for as little as three weeks to monkeys_ rats and all other species tested causes a 50-80% destruction of dopamine neurons in thr brain. This loss is permanent_ with studies showing no dopaminergic recovery over time.,"I dare anyone who has used Vyvanse for more than a month to stop using it and to see if they can still get the same amount of pleasure from life that they could before taking thus drug. A major misconception is that this drug is nothing like Crystal Meth. This drug damages the brain in an almost identical manner to Methamphetamine_ with the only difference being that Meth has the potential to also damage the brains serotonin neurons at high dosages. I have a Masters in Public Health so trust me when I tell you that Vyvanse_ Adderall and Dexedrine are identical to speed (amphetamine) and will destroy your brains natural pleasure and reward system very rapidly_ even at ""therapeutic dosages"". Type in on google ""amphetamine neurotoxicity in ADHD""_ ""amphetamine and parkinsons disease risk"" and ""Dopaminergic dysfunction in Dextroamphetamine users"" if you are interested to learn about the damage you have caused your brain. Methylphenidate (Ritalin and Focalin) are not neurotoxic and will not permanently reduce your brains capacity to feel pleasure_ atleast if you don't take it for more than a year. Stay away from amphetamine containing drugs if you have never taken one!",M,28,6  weeks30,9/13/2015,Vyvanse
37, 4, ADHD-memory issues,weight loss_ sleep disturbances_ dehydration_ headaches,I think this drug is very smooth and I can focus and stay on task..if I CHOOSE to. If i allow myself to 'follow' all my 'clever' thoughts while on this medication_ I can research and develop products and concepts ALL DAY_ and realize that I did not accomplish what I NEEDED to do. So_ my thinking is sharp as hell_ but my executive processing_ prioritizing.. may be in fact  be worse. When I am intensely tired_ ex: total sleep time 10 hours in 3 days. (I cycle through this every week) ...I can prioritize MUCH better. Something must be 'too' activating. Not sure yet. Vyvanse magnifies when I don't take care of myself. Too easy to not eat or drink or sleep. I work hard on that.,F,47,10  months60,9/5/2015,Vyvanse
38, 3, ADD,I tend to forget to eat or just am not hungry.  It's also very hard for me to sleep at night. I am constantly thinking and then have to look up whatever I was thinking about (e.g. I look online to see if someone created an invention I just thought of).,I do find that Vyvanse does help me focus and I'm able to accomplish more with it. However_ due to the side effects_ I'm now only taking it on days where I need to accomplish a lot (e.g. Setting up my new classroom).  At least this way I get some help without having side effects every day. I used to take vyvanse on a daily basis but lost a lot of weight in a short period of time since I lost my appetite.,F,37,1  years60,8/19/2015Email,Vyvanse

40, 5, Inattentive ADHD_ and Narcolepsy,Dry mouth_ dry eyes_ small loss of appetite occasionally_ a easier to irritate (I consider this less of a side effect_ as I was impossible to get angry at anything_ unless you messed with my food while I was eating it.),Okay I am gonna explain my experience in as much detail as possible. The first week I took vyvanse I was on 20mg_ Pros: I noticed improved concentration_ alertness_ and memory of AFTER I started taking it. Cons: anything before I started taking it was easily forgotten_ or hard to remember_ got dehydrated faster_ don't eat often_ but when I did it was a lot more then normal. After the first week or so_ my memory fixed its self_ I got used to drinking more liquids_ and less but larger meals. After that only thing I noticed was I needed a stronger prescription. As for the memory thing_ I talked to my specialist about it_ and he explained it to me_ and I came to the same conclusion_ but he said I explained it better. Sorry i could not fit everthing_ so If you have any questions feel free to email me_ I am no doctor but i have a lot of personal experience dealing with sleep_ eating habits_ and all the bad things the medication causes.,M,20,1  months20-30mg,8/2/2015Email,Vyvanse

It worked wonders at work yesterday and I was just working my butt off.  And I do intermittent fasting for weight loss so the curbed appetite just helps me even more. But an hour and a half ago I woke up and couldn't sleep.  And just about 30 mins ago I was on the toilet and didn't know if I had to use the bathroom or just throw up_ then had major diarrhea.

43, 5, Increased alertness and mood,I started feeling relief almost instantaneously. My mood and alertness improved just a few days after I began taking the medicine.The side effects didn't all start at once.  The first side effect I noticed was weight loss.  A week or so after that was decreased appetite.  The side effect that has had the most significant effect on me is my increased libido.  I mean_ I'm wanting to be with my husband 2 and 3 times a day.Most importantly Vyvanse is working as prescribed by my doctor.  My mood has been lifted and I'm more alert.,,F,32,2  months40 MG 1X D,7/23/2015,Vyvanse
44, 4, ADHD,A few negative side affects kept me from giving this a 5. They are the extreme headaches and bouts of anger I have if I don't have a high protein diet while on it. I also go from smoking a cigarette once every 4-6 hours to smoking once every 15-30 minutes (about 20x more). I can NOT quit smoking while taking Vyvanse.,Improves focus. You have to have the desire to organize for it to improve organization_ you have to have the desire to do your work for it to help you finish the work and act.WARNING: Do NOT let ANYONE know your prescribed Vyvanse unless you have to (i.e.doctors) or else people will bother you about giving or selling them to them or they may even steal them from you.,F,19,4  years60mg,7/18/2015,Vyvanse

My appetite is defiantly diminished_ but it's not as if I can't eat_ it just makes me content with portion sizes.,I have a heart condition and found that this medicine does not affect it.  I lost my job after not meeting my quota due to ADD.  I was always in the military so I could only take strattera (which did not help at all!) I retired from the Reserves and was able to try a stimulant based medicine again.  Unfortunately prior to my appointment to get on Meds I got fired for not reaching my quota.  After I got established with vyvanse I am able to focus_ and concentrate on my new job.  It gives me an euphoric feeling almost as a low dose of an anti-depressant.  Whe I was young I was on Ritalin and experienced anger_ depression_ and crashing.  I have not seen that with this.  My 8 year old daughter was diagnosed with ADD also this past month.  This is the only medicine at this time that I would feel comfortable starting her on.,F,35,2  months60 mg,7/15/2015Email,Vyvanse
46, 4, Adult ADHD,Nausea_ dry mouth,I am able to focus and get multiple tasks done throughout the day. I did feel nausea at first_ but it subsided after I started taking Vyvanse with food. It has significantly decreased my appetite_ which has helped me drop a few pounds. It is easy for me to get dehydrated on it_ so I drink water throughout the day. Overall_ the benefits have outweighed the side effects.,M,31,2  months40MG 1X D,6/3/2015,Vyvanse
47, 4, ADD,Nausea_ loss of appetite_ weight loss.,Vyvanse clears my mind_ thats the main benefit_ for me. I'm plagued by my thoughts. To say I would over think is an understatement. My mind was never free_ ever! I was a prisoner in my own mind. It was hard being me but that's the only me I knew until I finally gave in and spoke to a therapist who suggested I talk to Psychiatrist who could better help me. I was beyond hesitant - I don't even take Advil if I can help it. I was tired and completely defeated so I gave it a shot and voila... a new me! I was diagnosed with ADD but what Vyvanse really does for me is clear my mind - I can watch a movie and actually pay attention and NOT think about what i need to do tomorrow or what i should have done today or said to someone yesterday. Vyvanse has worked for me BUT only at 40 mg - anything more made me agitated and jittery. Nausea was prevalent the first little while but once that finally subsided I had extreme loss of appetite - that lasted for a good 6 months. Now_ almost a year in... my appetite is back to normal.,F,35,1  years40 MG 1X D,5/28/2015,Vyvanse

I constantly want to punch someone_ or cry in a ball on the floor. My throat is so dry to the point I almost can't even swallow my spit. My sleep pattern is so messed up some nights I go to bed at two A.M and others at 6 P.M. I've hardly eaten_ and lost over 10 pounds in just over a week_ and when I do try to eat I feel sick for hours. I can't property form a full sentence because my mouth gets to dry_ or I start stuttering. My stomach and head hurt really badly for at least a few hours everyday.

51, 5, ADD/ADHD,1. If I take Vyvanse later than 10 AM_ I can't sleep until 1 AM. Fortunately I take it between 5:30 and 7 AM. 2. When I come off of it_ I'm exhausted_ especially if I get less than 8 hrs of sleep the night before3. I have more joint pain in my knees and feet. I thought it was just me_ but then I got stomach flu and couldn't take Vyvanse for 4 days. The joint pain went away. I find that sleeping for 10-11 hrs on Fri or Sat night helps with the joint pain temporarily.,This med has enabled me to excel and work and get promotions and raises. Without it I am constantly distracted by what's going on in my environment_ fidget constantly and day dream. I also can't think clearly. When I started taking vyvanse_ it took about a week to get used to it. I had sleeplessness and aggression for a week_ the it got better_ but I would lose focus at around 2 PM. I upped my dosage from 20 to 30 mg and it settled down. I am much more confident_ can focus on multiple things at a time and deal with interruptions without forgetting what what I was doing or going on a wild goose chase. It really has improved my quality of life overall. Now I actually have motivation to get things done.,F,39,1  years30 mg,4/8/2015,Vyvanse
52, 5, Cuz I'm an amphetamine addict,Loss of appetite_ dry mouth_ racing thoughts_ impulse to write rhymes_ clean my room and play COD_ all goes away after a month,This shits the bees knees. Don't take more than you need or it's like smoking crack... I assume.  You can always up the dose_ but too much off the bat will make you nervous and shaky.  Once you metabolism syncs up with the medicine it's all smooth sailing and productivity. Ps not really an amphetamine addict. ADHD.,M,23,4  years60,3/17/2015,Vyvanse
53, 5, Anxiety_ Depression_ Obs thoughts,Very slight dry mouth,For the past year and half I've been dealing with anxiety and obsessive thoughts that I believe led to severe depression.  Got a new doctor and he prescribed vyvanse as a way to get my anxiety under control. I was feeling overwhelmed with anxiety and couldn't focus or concentrate.  I took it this morning and didn't feel any difference but when I got to work I realized that for the first time in a long time my mind was quiet. No worrying_ no recurring thoughts_ no anxiety. I was actually productive and_ dare I say_ content. I don't know if it's a fluke or not but_ at least for today_ I feel great. I actually want to work and spend time with my family. That hadn't happened in over a year. If it continues_ this drug will be responsible for getting my life back.  Keeping my fingers crossed.,M,47,1  days30 1X D,2/17/2015,Vyvanse
54, 5, ADD,Loss of appetite for sure_ I'll get a head ache if I forget to take it but other than that nothing else.,I have been struggling with ADD through out my life and I've literally tried everything and I mean everything_ and stopped about 6th grade_ I didn't take any ADD medication throughout highschool till a couple weeks ago and I've been struggling with my classes until I started taking Vyvanse I brought my 49% in geometry to a 72% within a matter of weeks. this is the second year taking the class and its never been easier to understand_ still a hard subject for me but not too bad anymore. Just over all I've never been more satisfied with a ADD pill I actually like taking it and I used to hate taking pills everyday.,M,17,3  weeks60 mg,2/12/2015Email,Vyvanse
55, 3, Menapause ADD,It actually worked for my ADD_ and I liked how it kept me on an even kill all day. No ups and downs like the Adderall I had been on for over a year. But side effects were bad.,Side effect after 30 days were horrible and I did not realize until  after I quit taking it that it was the Vyvanse_ Muscle pain in my wrist_ elbows_ shoulders and neck .Had even gone to an Orthopedic to find out what was going on.  VERY dry skin. thirsty all the time. Lost weight (which I can't afford to lose) Thought I was going nuts. I have OCD also_ but its organization OCD_ and on Vyvanse I couldn't care less about my files or office or anything. My hands and feet normally stay cold but they were a lot colder and felt like I was freezing all the time. I will not continue to take it. I will go back to Adderall.,F,49,30  days15 1X D,2/10/2015,Vyvanse

57, 5, ADD,Loss of appetite. Wake up feeling hung over. Insomnia. Extremely tired before taking in the morning. Nausea,The first night was hell. Day two I slept quicker. Wake up and you feel useless. The loss of appetite isn't bad. I still eat what I normally use to because once I eat my appetite grows just enough to allow me to finish. DRINK WATER LOTS or you'll be stuck with nausea. The only real problem at the moment for me is the mornings. Everything else is just something that I've gone through which was much worse when I was younger due to adhd. So far there are more positives than negatives to this drug and the side effects are slowly going away especially the insomnia. I can now focus properly and only daydream for 20% of the school day instead of 75%. When I first took it and went into my most difficult class that I was failing because I didn't pay attention  it took me less than an hour to learn that the class I was failing was actually the easiest one.,M,17,3  days20mg,1/31/2015,Vyvanse
58, 4, Adhd,Unable to sleep at first_ hunger loss,I was 16 when prescribed vyvanse. Before taking vyvanse I would smoke weed atleast once a day I loved smoking and had no plans to quit. After taking vyvanse I've had no urge to smoke at all. My grades in school have improved significantly. And I like the person I am on it allot better on vyvanse. The first few days was where the side effects were hitting me the most such as not being hungry_ the first 2 days I got almost no sleep but after that this drug has worked for me awesome. I was scared to medicate myself but I can honestly say I'm glad I did and wish I did it sooner.,M,17,8  months50mg,1/6/2015,Vyvanse

I've also taken dextroamphetamine spansules which had great results as well_ but Vyvanse seems smoother.  Great focus_ moods are stable_ increased libido_ and welcomed and gradual weight loss.  I no longer obsess over trivial things_ and am more outgoing and confident.  I get a greater satisfaction over any and all accomplishments_ which are many as a result of this med.  I look forward to the future and stopped dwelling on the negative past.  I'm more organized and methodical.  Overall_ great success.,M,55,6  months80mg 1X D,12/23/2014,Vyvanse
60, 4, ADHD - Inattentive type,Sweaty palms_ hyper focus_ talkative_ lack of appetite_ dehydration_ extreme highs (giddy_ elated feeling)_ and lows when coming off it_ insomnia_ diarrhea/upset stomach_ anxiety_ irritability,While the drug is and has been extremely helpful (which is why I've relied on it for so long)_ I am starting to deal with some of the long term effects. The biggest issue is that I'm severely dehydrated_ no matter how much water I drink - which had led to issues with low blood pressure. From about the time I wake up until the time I take my medication (around 11 am_ so I'll have an appetite for lunch)_ I feel nauseous_ dizzy_ lightheaded and extremely irritable. I also experience extreme exhaustion (I once slept 24+ hours when I didn't take it) and overeating. I can also confirm other reviews of extreme highs and lows.. When I've taken it_ I find myself getting really excited and spending hours focusing on one task_ then at the end of the day feeling extremely depressed and wondering why the heck I wasted so much time on that one task all day). The side effects I experience while on the prescription don't seem so bad compared to those while off it_ which is why I've been unable to stop taking it for so long (I take 1 each day_ or else lose a day to sleep - not to mention the forgetfulness & distractibility that return each time). Unfortunately_ I'm recently married and hoping to have kids so I'll have to deal with the consequences of trying to wean myself off of it.

I've been a long distance runner for over 30 years_ HR normally in the high 40's/low 50's. I went from being able to run 6 miles to barely able to walk up stairs.,My cardiac symptoms didn't show up immediately_ it took about a month of taking Vyvanse for me to notice and it crept up slowly.  I was only taking 20 mg and not every day (weekends off) so I didn't connect my cardiac symptoms to Vyvanse right away.  Finally it got so bad that I decided to quit Vyvanse and see if things improved.  It took at least a month but I'm back to normal now.  Taking Gingko Biloba instead.  Not as intense as Vyvanse but at least I'm not feeling out of breath just by getting up from a sitting position!,F,55,3  months20 mg 1X D,11/11/2014Email,Vyvanse

69, 5, Binge Eating Disorder,Hard time sleeping but compared to the results it is well worth it. I have been a binge eater for 25 yrs and have found this the ONLY medication and option for me to bring my life back. I have been a prisoner to binge eating for so long that it was killing me_ I had considered suicide more than once as the pain of living another day trapped in such an ugly disorder was simply too much. I have had major depression for most of my life and I have found that the reduction in my urge to binge has helped my depression also. I hope that this post will help at least one person in their quest to find a solution to binge eating - ask your doctor today - you will start with 20mg and quickly build to 60mg which is the dose studies and myself have found most effective.Good luck to you - email me if you would like to know anymore about this drug.,,F,41,3  months60mg,8/19/2014Email,Vyvanse

That's what made me finally stop taking it. Sadly. I miss it so much. I am losing a few handfuls of hair daily. (Had lab work all levels good)You can see my scalp.

72, 5, ADHD,Anxiety_,I have been taking Vyvanse daily since Feb 2008. Switched to Adderall for a few weeks here an there_ and maybe some days off (at most a week) but this stuff has pretty much been consistently in my system more than half a decade. In the early years of use_ I experienced some anxiety_ insomnia_ loss of appetite/libido agitation etc ... I was concerned for my heart and potential neuro/cardiotoxicity. I used to gorge on junk food_ skip sleep_ etc ... So I figured_ hey either I have to stop taking this_ or use it but use it responsibly. It was heavenly_ work became effortless_ I could accomplish more in an hour that what I did all week ... so I chose option 2. I started working out_ eating a healthy diet_ taking anitoxidants. So far no problems; in fact all of the side effects have completely disappeared except for anxiety (for which I take phenibut) so even that's not a problem. I get blood tests and an EKG twice a year. Everything came back normal. If Vyvanse causes long-term damage_ 6 years of daily use would be the acid test. But no_ I feel healthier than years ago (see exercise/diet part) ... and my cognitive abilities have improved (partly because I take loads of nootropics daily) ... switched from Business major to Statistics/Mathematics_ 3.8 GPA_ etc ... No complaints in this dept. ... use as directed_ eat well/rest/exercise and you shouldn't have a problem. Will I ever quit? Good question .....,M,22,6  years30 MG 1X D,7/23/2014Email,Vyvanse

So my doc took me off it and put my on Vyvanse. When I first started taking it it kept me up for most of the night the first week and thought I should stop taking it. But I decided since it made me more focused in school I could handle it. I was right_ my body just needed time adjusting to it. At school I am able to pay attention to the teacher_ even if I'm at the back of the class. Although sometimes when I'm on it I feel like an non-emotional zombie walking through the halls. I can focus on school work but I'm less my self when I'm on it. I can't express what I'm feeling. When it comes to talking to friends it feels like a constant job trying to have fun and be care free when all I wanna do is work on homework. It has also become harder since I'm now in a relationship. He has told me I'm a completely different person when I'm on it. Also that he prefers the me when I'm not on it because I'm more fun.

It's a great feeling having my work done and not freaking out about it late at night or even early in the morning. If you can't concentrate in school and procrastinate a lot.

Finally at age 7 I was officially diagnosed with ADHD (also a dx of dyscalclia which is like dyslexia but with numbers and a writing disability). I was put on Ritalin 2xs a day.

Once they realized those symptoms were caused by the Ritalin I was taken off and the school was forced to accommodate me. (A very small catholic school) I struggled through school barely making C's. Managed to graduate Highschool in 2009 and started college. That was a disaster. No motivation. Can't focus. Can't remember things. My gpa was crap!!! In 2013 a friend gave me some adderall. I was reluctant to try it because of my experience as a child but I went ahead and gave it a shot. I sat at a desk studying for 9-12 hours a day!! The only side effect was my mood was flat and I felt like a zombie. My vibrant personality was gone. I stopped taking it and started struggling again. Not until a month ago (March 2015) my doctor tried vyvanse and WOW!!!! My grades are already improving!!! Vyv does not flatten my mood. I'm still ""me"" just able to focus and remember things!!! Now on top of this I have gastroparesis (a paralyzed stomach)",,F,23,1  months30 mg,4/9/2014Email,Vyvanse
85, 3, ADD/focus,This drug really does what it needs to do despite some of the side effects. I was diagnosed with ADD after my senior year of high school. I am now in college taking this medicine two days a week. In the morning it is great. I can focus_ understand things more clearly_ and get things done. The worst part is when I am coming off of this medicine. I have headaches pretty much every time I take it. Also I have severe mood swings. The combination of a headache and the mood swings together is sometimes almost unbearable. I feel depressed and lose interest in just about everything. I don't want to be bothered at all and it's almost like I am a completely different person.,,F,18,4  months40mg,4/9/2014,Vyvanse
86, 5, ADD severe,a tingling in my face_ severe lackof appetite_jittery_definite jaw clenching. I suffered from a ADD my entire life. In the early 1980s this type of treatment was really unknown. Now in my 40's I have never been smarter_ focused_ and that background noise I have heard my entire life is gone. I can listen to the radio in the car snd folliw a conversation with out interrupting. Due to insurance I have tried many medications. Vyvanse by far_ most effective and it's absolute blessing. The weight loss is huge_ in the first 3 months i was down 40lbs fron no appetite. My first day taking this I cried. You have no idea the feeling when that background noise is gone_ and you are finally normal. If you do not have ADD these horrible side effects will be that severe_ if you need it you will be very pleased and see vyvanse as a miracle. Dont let the negative comments scare you.,,F,42,1  years70 mg,4/5/2014Email,Vyvanse

It also KILLS my libedo_ I can't get it up_ and if I can it won't stay hard. Loss of sexual desire. I have genital shrinkage_ it feels like I've dipped my balls in cold water.

With Work_ Family_ and School..that's no where near the amount of coverage I need. Be aware that Shire's claim to fame is that this drug lasts for 12 hours---IT DOES NOT. Picture a bell curve that lasts at a maximum...6 hours. However_ do not be discouraged_ my point is that you have to strategically take this medicine.

89, 4, Add,The most notable side effects are dry mouth and sweating(which I counteract with antiperspirant and it works well). Without it I am usually very bored by just about everything which makes me want to sleep alot. It definalty boosts my interest and motivation in doing things. I started taking adderall my junior year of high school but switched recently to the decreased amount of side effects. It greatly improved my preformance in school because I was always considered an underachiever_ due to me being in high level classes but never getting the grades that were expected. I ended up more or less getting straight A's through my final years of highschool_ when I was usually a C student. I am very impulsive when I am on it so I have to control what enviorment I put myself in but all in all I like it much better than adderrall,,M,19,1  days50,3/23/2014Email,Vyvanse
90, 4, ADD,This drug works. It had some crazy side effects-- cold cravings_ loss of appetite_ severe insomnia_ dry mouth_ irritability_ and weight loss were the biggest ones for me. Most of the reviews sound pretty daunting_ but talk to your doctor. If you're like me and have trouble stringing two thoughts together_ this drug is truly worth it. At my job_ I got recognition from my boss_ who eventually gave me a raise. In class_ my grades instantly rose_ with half the studying and double the results. I can think faster and clearer than I've ever been able to_ and the haze that always kept me from thinking straight is lifted. It's not easy to stick to_ but it's well worth the struggle.,,M,23,2  years60 MG,3/21/2014,Vyvanse
91, 1, ADHD+minor depression,I've struggled with ADD my entire life_ though it wasn't until about the middle of freshman year I got formally diagnosed. At first it was great. I could focus again_ I wasn't always tired anymore_ and I got better with my anger issues. But since ex the beginning of sophomore year it been HELL. I'm constantly cold_ exhausted during the day_ and way too energetic at night. I've lost my appetite_ and it's like I'm constantly under cold water (meaning my penis is totally shrunk). But that's not even half of it. I swear_ I think I'm starting to hear voices. At first_ it was just me thinking to my self_ but now in this corner in the back of my mind that never stops. The things it says are indescribable_ mainly because it's a Radom stream of insults_ prejudices_ and observation. And I'm getting more and more antisocial as time goes on_ literally all I do in school is just homework and idle chatter with my classmates_ and when I get home I hop in bed and play video games till dinner_ and it's really starting to worry me and my parents ( they only know that I'm becoming a recluse). To be honest I'm thinking of ditching this drug_ and though I highly recommend not using it_ if you have to then only take it once or twice a week_ because it takes up to 3 days for the effects to wear off. I've never tried quitting it but now I'm gonna BEWARE its highly addictive and if you're anything like me you will develops a dependance on it,,M,15,10  months50,2/26/2014Email,Vyvanse

93, 5, ADHD,Loss of appetite_ therefore causing weightloss_ dry mouth_ insomnia I started at the lowest dosage which was 20 or 30 mg I believe. I was gradually increased to 70 mg based on effectiveness. Almost immediately I lost my appetite and had to force myself and set reminders to eat. Dry mouth was also immediate however I didn't drink a lot of fluid either. Craved ice cream and cold things. The insomnia was a problem off and on but tapered off. Over the years depending on life interaction I have had the dosage adjusted for insomnia or tachycardia (fast heartbeat) initially I lost 40 lbs but gained it back eventually.  As to what I am actually using it for_ ADHD the effects were also immediate.  My productivity at work skyrocketed. Increased by about 15-20%. Went from hardly working to completing my work in half the day_ and increased boredom with the job. You can look at that either way. But I got a new job w/in 6 months making 10k more per year. I also went to and completed grad school while working full-time. So yea basically_ I'd say it works_ just gotta find the right dosage and monitor results and your health.It is rather expensive and there is no generic_ there are coupons bad discount programs out there.,,F,31,4  years70,2/20/2014Email,Vyvanse

At first it went very well with only decreased appetite_ then it started turning and I became moody. I became partially depressed and didn't want to do anything. I slowly stopped taking the drug and only used it when I knew I would need the focus it brought me (exams_ big test_ lots of chores to do_ etc.). I took it for the first time in about two months the other day and although it increased focus slightly_ it had a disastrous effect on my manhood that afternoon_ and I had never had this problem before. Moral of the story: stay on the medication and it will do as intended_ but if you stop and start as I do_ be prepared for big side effects.,,M,17,1  days20 MG,1/2/2014,Vyvanse

I will be sitting in class and all the sudden i will forget everything that just happened and ask myself ""am i dreaming? Where am i? Is this real?"" And than i can never sleep. No matter what time i take it_ i can still never sleep. The worst part is the anger outburst and the depression i get with the medication. I hate myself when im on it and feel like no body wants me. I feel depressed and sad and just want to sit in a room by myself and not talk to anyone. I just want to stair at the walls. I also cannot eat while on the pill.

But most importantly before vyvanse I would make C's in most classes for school. Now I make straight A's and I am completely focused and completing all assignments given to me.

100, 3, ADD,Constant dry mouth and thirst no matter how much water I drink. Decreased appetite but I've been on adderall before this and have a system for making sure I eat enough even if I don't want to. Hard to tell if it makes me less social since I am always pretty disinterested in conversation. Hard time going to sleep if I take it past 10 am_ usually can force myself to sleep by 3 or 4 am but sometimes I just stay awake all night. Increased heart rate which makes working out difficult_ but I still do it. I find when I go a day without Vyvanse_ I can't force myself to workout or do much of anything. All of these symptoms are manageable and worth handling because it helps me so much with even the simplest of tasks throughout my day. The only symptom that makes me want to switch medication is the heat and sweating. I sweat horribly_ all day long. I can't take it during the summer when it's already hot outside. In the winter I am okay outside but walking indoors is torture,Better than Adderall because it really does last all day long. Although eating is just as difficult and food makes the drug feel slightly weaker_ you can eat. On Adderall if I ate anything_ the medication would be useless.

Helps me wake up and not be tired all the time. Despite negative side effects_ definitely worth it. I feel like I could go higher on dose though sometimes.

103, 1, ADHD,It's horrid. Sometimes I question myself as to weather or not I'm human while on this drug.  The pills do what they're supposed to- keeping me concentrated and focused on the task at hand.  I have created some awesome stuff while on it. Heck_ I got a 4.0 GPA. I was diagnosed with ADHD in third grade. I was a rebel child and refused to take the pills they gave me (a meltdown was good enough to convince my parents to get me off the pills). I passed through sophomore year with almost decent grades so my parents didn't push it.  I first started taking vyvanse my junior year. At the beginning was pretty good_ I got so much accomplished and I was pretty proud of myself. Unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros. I can't sleep_ I can't remember any of my dreams_ I would forget to eat for days at a time_ I have lost my creative passion_ and  I physically can not make any sort of conversation with people. That was just during the school day. By 8PM I am miserable. I feel like just a shell of my normal self. I'm not actually me. (Is it possible for the drug to cause multi-personality disorders?). There's this deep emptiness in me wherever I look. My mind is exhausted but it's still racing with thoughts of nothingness.  I'm so miserable that I want to cry but it's close to impossible to show any sort of emotion. On the few times I have cried in this drug there is no sense of relief_ only utter despair.

104, 5, adhd,Overall my life was a lot more productive while on the medication. That is why I opted to go back on it. Withdrawal was horrid though. I do remember having a problem one year with what I call store-tweaking_ where I would intend to go a store for 5 minutes and it would ALWAYS turn into an_ a least_ 3 hour shopping trip_ but it would only feel like a half hour to me.....Its definitely a drug that reduced some of my brain's ability to work efficiently in some ways but its pro's outweigh the con's_  I also lost the ability to articulate which used to be my strength_ and have memory lapses that can be likened to Alzheimers.... although they are reduced when on the medication. As well I experience the evening bouts of impatience_  and kind of a 'coldness' where I dont feel like dealing with people. They really need to do something to adjust this drug.....I know they can.,Took it for almost 2 yrs then stopped a yr_ now back on 1 wk. The Strengnths of this medication for me is that it reduces my tendency to paralyze due to being overwhelmed by a task_ conversation_  activity_ chore or creative solutions. Sounds ridiculous but that is one of my issues.  I froze during the beggining of the year I was off the medication_ but then began working on skills to improve my ability to manage life_ when I got to a place where I was exerting as much effort as I could but still falling short...(was about to lose a job I just got_ because of some of my Adhd symptoms that I couldn't keep track of_ (losing things_ forgetting things I was trained on_ and unable to draw common sense conclusions_ because my mind was overwhelmed with processing information) I was able to go back on the meds just in time_ and my performance was comparatively like night and day.

What used to keep me up at night doesn't anymore. I can focus on things without being distracted by several negative things at once. I am also on this because I struggle with bulimia_ and have for 15 years. This medication suppresses my appetite_ which helps me not think about food_ and not be hungry.

The second day was a lot better but I had no desire to eat what so ever. I had to make myself eat and drink which took away a lot of the symptoms. I recommend eating right before you take it because even though you probably won't be hungry you still needs food to run. Eating also really helps with being dizzy but be careful not to eat too much or you might feel sick-just a snack will do.    I've been much more productive then I usually am but I still have to push myself to start the work I need to do. I told my teachers that I started the medicine for my ADHD and what it was supposed to do. I also told them that there may be side effects and they told me if I needed to step out of the classroom or do whatever it was fine with them. Most of my teachers were happy to know that I started it because they know I'm smart but I struggle when it comes to getting school work done and I'm a horrible test taker. My test grades have actually improved a little since I started vyvanse even thought today is only my 3rd day. I'm also a lot more social which is a huge improvement for me because I'm usually very shy (possible aspergers).,F,17,3  days30 mg 1X D,2/16/2013Email,Vyvanse

125, 4, ADHD,dry mouth_ hearing occasional noises that are not there_ dizzyness_ loss of appetite_ constipation_ increased heart rate_ heart palpitations_ detachment_ inability to sleep_ lack of physical energy,"Vyvanse has completely eliminated all of my symptoms of ADHD and really helps me to focus in school_ having raised my GPA from a 3.2 (before any medication) to a 3.8 (since taking vyvanse). It even alters my state of mind_ motivating me to work hard_ as well as enabling me to work efficiently. However_ grades are the only positive effect I have seen_ and I will most definitely stop taking it when I am out of school. When I take vyvanse I become a completely different person: obsessive_ pessimistic_ lethargic_ angry_ and almost incapable of laughing or smiling. On the days I forget to take it (or on the weekends when I choose not to)_ everyone notices an extreme change in my personality--back to the ""regular me"" who likes to laugh and do stupid things. The obsession is sort of like OCD...but only when I take vyvanse...making me only stress over messiness and imperfection_ but never doing anything about it. Because I am typically a hyperactive person_ vyvanse has taken away all of my energy_ leaving me incapable of exercising or completing simple tasks. It makes me feel separate from reality_ constantly spinning_ hearing things_ and staying away from people. Monday-Friday when I take vyvanse_ I can't fall asleep until at least 4am and even then wake up throughout the night_ and somehow I am still able to fully focus the next day when waking up at 7am But when I don't take vyvanse_ the lack of sleep catches up to me and I require about 14 hours  of sleep.

131, 1, ADHD,Heart palpitations_ excessive sweating while working out_ severe anxiety/agitation_ vision impairment/ whiting out during withdrawal period,As a freshman ivy league student_ I thought I needed Vyvanse to  excel in school_ I was wrong. Yes_ initially Vyvanse helped me focus_ but over time the negative effects began to outweigh the positives. Regardless of what physicians_ pharmacists_ or pharmaceutical companies say_ Vyvanse is an addictive drug. Perhaps the exact chemical compound itself is less addictive than alternatives_ but the effects it has on your brain and pscyhe are certainly cause for concern. I share my opinions with you out of geniune concern for American adolescents. Vyvanse and similar drugs are not to be taken without warning. There are no longitudinal studies to demonstrate their safety_ but in from my own experiences_ they are not safe long term. Yeah I graduated and yeah I did well in school_ but had I know the pain_ self-doubt_ panic attacks_ tics_ generalized anxiety and depression Vyvanse would eventually cause me_ I never would have taken it. When I began Vyvanse I did not understand its potency. I didn't understand that it could change my personality. In retrospect I would have traded the concentration and focus Vyvanse provided me for my mental and physical health without hesitation. Vyvanse is a serious drug with real life-altering side effects_ please consider this before taking it. Yes Vyvanse can help in the short term_ but not without consequences.

I don't take it if I don't have school and I love not taking it because I am me again. My doctor said it wouldn't change my personality but it has. I am not as fun_ I think I am boring while on Vyvanse. When I take breaks and then take it again I get diarrhea and it is ONLY on the first day. My mouth is SUPER dry and my lips are always chapped. I lost so much weight and I don't exercise at all. That is the great thing about it. But I eat soo much the first day when I am not on it. I hardly sleep and I hate it because then I am tired when I wake up then when I take it I have all this energy_ then when I get home I am super tired and I can't sleep because I still have a ton of energy and then when I go to sleep it is hard for me to sleep.

I told my doc to switch me to Adderall XR.  I really like Vyvanse and it lasts 12-14 hours like many other stims clain to.  These comments won't apply to all because I'm on 5 meds to control bipolar.  I couldn't get the anhedonia to lift when I asked my doctor to put me on stims.  I knew they worked and my life started to change in positive directions with this med.  Not a street drug feel but an even feel with more interest in things like cleaning house etc.  Hopefully the Adderall will help_ I haven't taken it since '03 so we'll see.

136, 3, To help focus during school.,Major loss of appetite (I'll easily go through a day or two without eating anything.)_ easily irritated_ spouts of insomnia_ depression_ suicidal thoughts (not often)_ increased urge to smoke.,Vyvanse really helps my focus and concentration during school_ my mind still likes to wonder off_ but I continue to understand and comprehend what is being taught/lectured during class. The worst part about taking vyvanse--for me--is that from the moment I get home I am not the same person. I get easily irritated when spoken to (friends or family) and just want to be left alone. The loss of appetite is a bit of a problem because I'm tall and thin as it is. I usually have to force myself to eat_ or I will eat before taking the pill. If I try to eat after it has kicked in I hardly eat much of anything_ and end up throwing away most of a good meal.

However_ my social life crashed due to the fact that I no longer had the ability to NOT focus. This drug made me moody_ depressed_ antisocial_ and easily agitated; especially towards to end of the day. Within the first few months of taking vyvanse I had successfully pushed away the people who cared about me_ and closed myself off emotionally. Of course this only made me more depressed. This continued until eventually I had a suicide attempt and FINALLY people clued in!!! Now it is a year later and I am MUCH better! I worked with my doctor to find a steady balance in my dosage_ plus we incorporated a mood stabilizer called Wellbutrin that has proved most effective. Although things have improved as I have worked through the kinks of the drug_ there are still differences in my personality when I am on the drug. On the drug I notice that I am quieter and less outspoken/charismatic. This is not to brag at all! I do not mean to say that off the drug I am like the most outgoing awesome person_ but like_ I am. The hyperactiveness of my ADHD made me a much funner person compared to when I am on the vyvanse and that hyper-ness is being suppressed.

161, 5, ADHD,Loss of appetite; the feeling like I might clench/grind my teeth_ but it hasn't happened yet; dry mouth_ which means I have experienced some annoying polyuria.,This is an amazing_ amazing medication.  Granted_ I'm new_ but I've never felt more calm_ motivated_ and focused.  Now that I know what normal feels like_ I don't want to go back to my non-medicated self.  The crowded_ obsessive_ intrusive thoughts stopped.  (The best way to explain is that every thought comes in single file.)  I'm not impatient_ anxious_ or irritable.  I listen and when I speak_ it doesn't feel like my thoughts are so disorganized that I don't know what I'm saying.  I've stopped blurting out answers.  I'm more sociable.  Seriously_ if I knew that I could be this functional_ I never would have gone this long unmedicated.Now_ side effects: they're mild_ so far_ but I'm also on a starting dose.  So far_ I've not had problems sleeping anymore so than I usually do.  I took 2.5 mg of melatonin last night and I was knocked out.  This medication is a smooth on and smooth off.  Unfortunately_ it didn't last all day for me_ but this is something that can be adjusted_ so it's not a big deal. (I took it at 6:30 am and it started to not work around 3:30.)  I had zero appetite though.  I forgot to eat the first day and even though I wasn't hungry_ my blood sugar crashed mid-afternoon and I felt sick_ so my recommendation is to eat something mid-day even if it's little.  You don't want the medication to be winding down slowly and for you to feel miserable because your glucose levels have tanked.If you're sensitive to other stimulants_ I would recommend Vyvanse.

165, 5, treatment resistant depression/fati,Dry mouth.  Brief euphoria within 90 min of first dose.  Heart palpitations.  Fatigue after several hours (can be remedied by exercise).,I had been on Adderall previously for two years until it became unavailable last fall in our area.  My Dr. recommended Vyvanse.  I love it for several reasons: one: it is smooth -- no come down or super high like I got from Adderall.  Two: same nice benefits from dopamine -- increased patience_ attention_ focus_ good feelings.  Three: I feel like the me I've known before the depression/anxiety.What I notice now however is that I do better if I take Vyvanse for three days and then take a day or two off.  It makes me quite fatigued_ which was a symptom that did not manifest early on.  I noticed it within the last month -- like tired behind the eyes_ but my mind was stimulated -- so_ I take a day or two off and feel good (I make sure to exercise as this is so helpful for my depression) and then when I take my Vyvanse I feel good.You really have to monitor yourself and be your own advocate -- but this medicine has been excellent for me in treating chronic depression that had become unresponsive to other drug combinations.I have yearly blood work to monitor hormone changes and am also on hormone replacement therapy.  All work together as key components of maintaining good mental health along with diet_ exercise_ fish oil/supplements.,F,45,8  months50mg 1X D,4/10/2012Email,Vyvanse

After taking it for a while the medicine doesn't work so great every day for me. I started at the lowest dosage and now I am at the highest which still does not work to good anymore.  If I do not take it for a week or so it will start to work pretty good again.  In school I am able to concentrate a lot more_ and I complete all my work with no problem.

When I stop taking it_ I am exhausted_ irritable_ and it really shows that I need rest. But because of my life_ I have forgotten how to recognize feeling tired.  This drug has essentially helped me manage what three people would normally... And even though I am sad that I have to live life this way_ like a machine_ the drug helps me stay on task and function when a human being really needs rest.   I would have fallen apart with my work load and lack of family support without this medication.  It allows me to survive more than humans should.  But when it is out of my system_ it seems like I need three solid rest days to recover from the physical and mental exhaustion of being in high gear burn out mode all week.

On my second month I was bumped up to 30mg and and I felt the high for a week or so then I became depressed and the medication wasn't lasting as long as before. And in the past week I have become extremely emotionless and distant from people around me. Antisocial behavior has become a larger issue as well as the irritability.

Vyvanse seems to regulate at an even pace for me and lasts about 15 hours. I deliver pkgs for a living_ so the physical labor as well as the situational awareness issues are suited well for this type of medicine. I make sure I drink a lot of water to filter the drug out of my system_ and then I sleep like a rock now at night. I used to dream all day and all night_ worthless things that I thought might be deep thoughts but really it was just endless brain dumps. Vyvanse has cut that way down.

201, 5, Some mixture of ADD and ADHD,I have lost 12 pounds since I've started taking it_ as I'm not hungry often (sometimes to the point where I can't even make myself eat...I sometimes only eat a meal a day) though I don't mind because I had gained that weight in the last year or two. I occasionally (mainly when I haven't eaten enough in a day) will feel like my heart is beating pretty fast_ but eating usually helps. I do notice that I can be irritable_ but I'm sure to be careful about snapping at people.,It has helped me immensely with paying attention in school and doing well as well as with getting things done such as homework_ work_ and cleaning. I also feel much less hesitant to speak up_ it has brought out my social side that before would be overtaken by over thinking. I tried it once before (2 years ago) but I was in a bad relationship and was not able to handle the side effects and my girlfriend told me that I was incredibly irritable. It's a good drug_ but you need to be careful with your emotions and be sure to eat enough!,M,22,6  weeks50 MG 1X D,11/30/2011Email,Vyvanse

204, 3, Adult ADHD,I started with 20 mg vyvanse. With 20 mg_ my appetite decreased significantly. I ate a small meal a day and sometimes I'll just have a bottle of gatorade for the whole day. I've lost weight with vyvanse 20 and wellbutrin together. The 1st day of increasing my dose to 30 mg_ I started to become really agitated and borderline obsessive.,,F,24,2  days30 mg,11/24/2011,Vyvanse
205, 5, Adult ADHD,Loss of appetite_ bitter taste in mouth_ irritability (only when it starts to wear off at night)_ low alcohol tolerance,"I have been able to do so much better in college since I started Vyvanse. Its unfortunate that I didn't go to the doctor sooner because now the semester is almost over_ but at least it will help a lot for the final exams! One big side effect is my appetite_ which is pretty much not existent anymore. I've noticed I can go days without eating and when I do eat I'm very picky. Usually I'll have soup (like broth_ nothing heavy or creamy) or something fresh (i.e. vegetables_ fruits) Chicken is ok sometimes (I don't eat red meat in the first place) and for some reason I don't like eating bread anymore. Even when I do eat_ I never finish my food. Needless to say I've lost weight because of the whole not eating thing. But it's also given me a lot of energy so I'm really active now. It's not like a ""hyper"" energy that you get from too much coffee because for the most part I feel very calm most of the time. I've been able to clean more_ go to the gym_ study and pretty much overall get my life back together. I've lost about 20 pounds in a little over 2 weeks_ which sounds like a lot_ but I actually gained those 20 pounds in the past 4 months when I came to college_ so Im okay with it.One small thing I've noticed is that it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth all day long. I don't know how to describe except that it reminds me after I've had surgery or been given anesthesia_ its like that taste you have in your mouth you wake up after surgery.

I would highly recommend this drug for add or adhd paitients. The only real bad parts are when you are going to sleep. My feet get cold and I cannot sleep at all.

My wife and I will be moving in just 2 weeks. So I'm packing boxes_ repairing items that need to be repair to sell and meeting with moving reps for quotes. Before this I was working a part-time job at a machine shop with Archie Bunkers all around me. I never was a negative person till I started taking Vyvanse.  Now this drug is fantastic for work. My concentration and focus were never better. But I recently I tore into our babysitter of 2 years for being a slacker_ which I never did ever before. Which of course started a battle with my wife. We never had major verbal battle for eight years of our marriage. Thank God I was able to explain my uncalled outrage because of others having the same reaction I did on this website. Thank you to those.  But in a lighter note. If you hope to save your career. Take this early in the morning before work.

My focus is decent. I'm super thirsty_ but nothing I haven't experienced from other ADHD meds I've tried. The crash is really tough and I'm not plesant to be around. I eat ok_ my hunger is slightly surpressed but again_ its manageable. So_ far I haven't had any side effects any worse than any other med my doctor has put me on. I'm excited that I'm not overly shakey like I have been in the past with other stimulant medications. I don't take it everyday_ only when I know I need to be able to focus i.e. when I work. It doesn't cause me to hyper focus_ so sometimes I can feel mind begining to wander_ so I have to be aware of that.

211, 5, ADD,I have been watching myself closely for the last three days. The differences that taking this medicine has been fantastic. These are the side-effects that I've noticed so far.-Jitters-Dry Mouth (Always need water)-Diarrhea-Loss of appetite (I'm never hungry)-Sweating-Nausous on the 3rd day-No emotions (oddly),I am 20 years old and in college. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in eighth grade_ but I didn't seem severe enough to medicate me. My grades were normal and I didn't have any behavorial issues. When I came to college_ paying attention and finding the motiviation to do things started to get more difficult. When my grades started to slip_ I realized that I needed to be re-evaluated. ADD can go unnoticed in grade-school_ but become problematic in College due to the stress and pressure. It was starting to interfere with my schooling. After taking it for just these three days_ I can't believe how much of a difference it's made. I feel normal. My classes aren't as hard as they've seemed and it's not a problem to pay attention at all! I'm seeing things that I've missed before and I am just very happy to finally be this content with everything. I absolutely recommend Vyvanse.The one thing that I have noticed that I'm not sure what to think about is that I don't have any emotions. Before the things that would usually make me happy_ excited_ sad_ or upset_ I just feel really neutral about. Luckily I know how I should feel about stuff_ so I don't seem so detached about things around friends_ family_ etc_ but I could see how that could be a problem for younger kids who don't really know how to react in certain situations.,F,20,3  days30 MG 1X D,10/28/2011Email,Vyvanse

213, 4, ADD and ADHD,I really like this drug becouse for the past 5 years people have been gettinng on my ass for bad grades and not being able to focus and i started out on 85mg of srattera but it did not help at all so then i got a prescription for vyvanse and I love it its helped me out a ton i am focusing well_ my grades are coming up_ and i absoluely love life! (i troubled a small amount of depression but nothing severe but thanks to this drug thats all gone.) Also i should mention im 14 and a freshman in high school.I think anyone with my problems should give it a try at a small dose and work there way up to an appropriate dose_ but everyones diffrent so it might not work for you. I take one capsule every morning before school and when i wake up on the weekends_ the only bad thing it only last about 10 hours wich is a little amount of time soo i would prefer about 14 or 15 hours. Now here are the bad things about it- most of the time i feel very warm and my face feels flushed_i dont have as big of an,from being a teenager and i have not seen anyone else with this side effect. but for the most part this drug is worth it i think but everyones different_ i really think this drug is going to help me make beter grades and hopefully make it into a good college wich really means a lot to me! One final thing is before i too vyvanse i was very bad about impulse or being talked into things_ peir pressure- drinking_ smoking_ smoking pot_ but now im not going to let anyone do that too me like i used too wich was way too much and maybe not at all anymore. I really hope whoever reads this gets helped out just remember everyones diffrent and drugs are not allways the awnser_ sometimes medicine isnt the right tool to fix something. feel free to talk to me about your experiences_ suggestions or tips_ or anything else that could help you and me. I am no professional though just a 14 year old that wants everyone to have a good life_ you should talk to your doctor first though or a parent_counsler_ or any responsible understanding  adult. I havent been on the drug long though and i will try to update my story as time passes. I really hope this helps you!P.S.- sorry for any grammer mistakes.,M,14,1  weeks 1X D,10/19/2011Email,Vyvanse
214, 5, Adhd,Some insomnia if taken too late in the day_ Some loss of appetite. But after time this subsided. Some increase in blood pressure but not severe.,Well where do I start along with some other posts ive read on here i have to go with GODSEND. I was a great student in school but because of my undiagnosed adhd and anxiety .I could never live up to my real potential. The social anxiety lasted well into my adult life. Although I was social and ran a successful business_ it was a real struggle. and cost me my marriage as i used cocaine and other drugs to self medicate. A few years ago I started taking vyvanse.and within a day or so the world was a different place for me it was almost like being born again this heavy cloud was lifted tasks became easier and I became exponentially more productive. started enjoying being around people more with less anxiety. I stopped using other drugs almost immediately and as many of the posts here describe my organizational skills and social life have improved incredibly.

216, 4, ADD,Cigarette craving_ headache_ dry mouth_ irritable_ loss of appetite.,I originally started on 40s_ but bumped up to 50s about a month or two later. I stayed on 50s for about 9 months and it worked wonderfully. I would get 12-15 hours of studying done each day_ and would feel it wearing off in time for bed at 10pm. I switched to 60s a year ago. Worked very well for 6 months. However_ in the past 6 months_ it has been working less and less. Obviously_ this is my tolerance for it kicking in. I expected this_ but I refuse to start taking 70s because I find that to be too much. But here's the strange thing: starting 3 months ago_ insomnia began. I take it first thing in the morning (between 6 and 7am) so that it'll wear off in time for bed. However_ I cannot fall asleep until 2am. This even occurs when I pour out a little of the powder_ reducing it to roughly 50 MG. The focus wears off around 3 or 5pm_ but I just can't get tired. It's getting to the point that all the focus that I originally got from it is barely there_ and I'm just an irritable person. I wish it worked the same way that it once did_ because I had never been that productive before. But I guess the latest events is proof that stimulant therapy is not meant to be the primary treatment for ADD.,F,21,2  years60 MG 1X D,9/15/2011Email,Vyvanse

I have taken my sister's adderal for 6-8 months one time when she didn't want it. This med. helps me with impulsiveness but I still jump from one thing to another. Focus improved a little. But starting the 2nd week I have seen things that are not there 4 times. I saw a dark figure crawling under my truck and it wasn't there when i bent down to check. I have a front door with window pains with white sheer curtains. One day I looked at the door and a dark triangle appeared on the bottom window pain for a second. The curtain is held down by a rod. It wasn't real. It really didn't look like anything so I know it wasn't there. Yest. my husband was carrying my 6 year old on his back and I told him to watch out for the ceiling fan and looked up and the ceiling fan was on med. speed but looked like it stopped for a split second. Like something dark took over my eyes. Almost like the dark thing I saw on the door. I have had some depressed feelings which I have fought off. I usually never get depressed. And I have been very irritable for no reason. Try to pick a fight with my husband and have outbursts. Also_ I have noticed I am forgetting things. Like where I have used my bank card. My balance is screwed up now. Little things I need to reme_ber I am forgetting but are important to function. I can't remember what happened this morning on certain things.

219, 5, ADD inattentive disorder,Originally I was only being treated for slight depression and mild-slightly severe anxiety around people and social situations. (hard to job hunt when you are having a panic attack_ lol).  After about a year_some verbal and written tests as well as giant questionnaires for parents I was told I had ADD Inattentive Dsrder.  Quite shocking_ I always thought ADD = hyper people only.  Was ASKED IF i wished to try medications and which.  I read up on most and decided on Vyvanse_ due to the composition and smoothness of delivery I hoped to reduce any negative effects on my anxiety the doctor agreed.GREATEST thing ever to happen to me!  I don't wander off into daydreams all the time when I'm trying to work on something.  I feel happy and upbeat and surprisingly enough it has done wonders for my anxiety_ more so than lorazepam or clonazepam(still on this one)_ but since taking vyvanse I've managed to taper down to a lower dosage and perhaps to 0 eventually. I can actually go up to and have,Vyvanse is a pretty expensive drug with no generic availble (and won't be I imagine for some time).  But it works wonders if you actually need it. Never tried Adderall so can't really compare personally_ but I think a lot of reviews here are perhaps wanting a quick fix and are displeased when they see they can't abuse it as readily.  Also those coming off instant release adderall or other type of add med and going to vyvanse and are feeling tired should note that's because vyvanse is time released and not a rush all at once type of drug.  Not sure about adder xr... vyvanse is only dextroamphetamine after it's broken down and doesn't have the Levoamphetamine portion as adderall which causes people to be more wakeful or have extreme energy. So people need to be aware of this and perhaps try to stay on it for maybe a month so their body can adjust itself.... def talk to your doctor about that.,M,28,1.5  years60 MG 1X D,8/18/2011Email,Vyvanse

It worked great for me and I was very successful in school. I stopped taking it so I could get into the Army. I had since managed to do ok using coping skills that have helped me. I got Cancer in 2009/10 and since the extreme chemo I went through my memory is gone and my attention span was shot. My doctor started me on the Vyvanse and WOW what a change. I have great follow through_ attentive_ and much more focused. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and take meds for that and the Vyvanse has not done anything to make the severe depression worse.

221, 3, ADHD,I have been taking vyvanse for two years. I love the drug_ probably a little too much. I can focus well on it feeling the need to do tasks_ homework_ cleaning_ etc. and I lose weight on the medicine from lack of eating. Some bad side effects I've had are these: severe headaches around 3:30/4:00PM_ teeth grinding_ dry mouth_ immense sweating under my arms_ unsocial_ and sometimes irritable and angry. I've suffered from large depression under it. Also_ now whenever I dont take the drug_ I've found myself uncapable of doing almost everything; I am ten times more lazy than when I first went on vyvanse. I do not think thats healthy. It's like I've become dependant on this drug in order to lead a successful life. The drug almost isnt worth these side effects; I'm not 'me' when I take it_ but as a teenager I have so much pressure to get good grades to get into a good college_ that I almost have to in order to simply get by. I love vyvanse but I also hate it.,If you suffer from depression_ an eating disorder_ or have a bipolar disease DO NOT take this drug. To start this drug MAKE SURE you are very emotionally stable because vyvanse will take you on a rollercoaster.,F,17,2  years50 MG 1X D,8/10/2011,Vyvanse

223, 4, ADHD,Everything has been good until the past several months.  My daughter is 9 years old and has recently been very mouthy_ rude with the family_ rude with her friends.  She's pretty much a smart ass.  I was thinking it was just her age showing but have also decided that maybe we need to increase the dose on her Vyvanse_  She has always taken 30 mg and I plan to ask the doctor to increase it to 40 and maybe soon after that go to 50.  I am worried that when school starts back up that she is going to piss off some one or have a problem making new friends.,We took her to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to see a doctor (Campbell maybe?) that did studies on child ADHD.  He is the one that prescribed the medication which was new at the time.  She is a very athletic girl and very smart in her studies.  This summer she has been slacking on her reading because she has new neighbor kids and is wanting to play all the time.  Which i thought may be another reason for her attitude...maybe she is getting so exhausted.  She does have some loss of appetite after breakfast but she is about 85 lbs and solid.  She could stand to lose about 10 lbs.  If anyone or their child has similiar issues I would love to hear from you.,M,9,4  years30 mg 1X D,7/15/2011Email,Vyvanse
224, 2, ADHD,,MAJOR UPDATE!!!!!    IF YOU ARE BIPOLAR - DO NOT TAKE VYVANSE!!!!  The drug pegged me to a 4 month long mania that I did not recognize since I never realized that I was bipolar.  Looking back_ it makes sense_ but at the time_ the Vyvanse did solve my problems with attention and follow-through.  BUT_ I was yet undiagnosed as bipolar_ so I was not aware of what was coming.  After stopping the Vyvanse_ I entered into a 6 week extreme (really extreme) depression that actually required hospitalization twice.  I later learned that 40% of ADD/ADHD patients are also bipolar.  That is significant enough that anyone entering drug therapy for ADD/ADHD should also be carefully screened for bipolar or depressive episodes.

225, 4, ADD. Depression_ Extreme Fatigue,Before vyvanse I illegally tried adarol. It was amazing. Though I could not sleep at all that night_ it felt as if a cloud were lifted off of my head and I finally had energy....I finally realized that there is another way to think. I ended up going to the doctor and he gave me vyvanse 70 mg. I was 16 years old and 120 pounds. I am now 17 135. Vyvanse works just the same. BUT with way less crash and it lets you sleep at night rather than adarol. Vyvanse is just way better overall. Though...I do find myself taking it every other day....or taking a couple or a few days off from it because of the extreme loss of appetite.,After about a year of this medication the extreme loss of appetite is starting to piss me off.

I'd be screaming and yelling running for the light switch and there I was all by myself.  Extreme irritability also_ and crying spells.,My doctor obviously gets money for pawning this stuff on people_ because I'm depressed and anxious_ and she decided I had adhd.  I needed sedatives_ certainly not a methamphetamine like Vyvanse.  After the 9 days on it I threw the rest out and called my psychiatrist and basically said she almost killed me and I'd be going elsewhere from now on.

228, 2, treatment resistant depression,anger_agitation_frustration_extreme mood swings_emotional outbursts (crying),After being on adderall for nearly four years_I began to experience diminishing returns...(Very short period of relief /energy followed by a spiral into depression or fatigue...Usually both.) I became very frustrated with these mood swings and decided that Vyvanse _with its extended life_ might eliminate the problems that I had experienced with adderall.  I did a lot of research and was really hopefull that this drug might be the answer. From what I could see_it had been quite beneficial for many people in my predicament. I gave it two months as that was all I could tolerate. It never provided me any relief. Even after my doctor reduced the dosage_I found myself exhibiting behavior (anger outbursts) that I didn't know I was capable of.  I was constantly on edge and ready to explode if 'things didn't go' as I thought they should. For the first time in my life_ I began to think that I was developing a serious anger issue...Thank god that it wasn't too long before I made the connection and stopped the vyvanse. Within a few days or so_ I was more or less back to my old self minus the anger. For me_this medication was simply too potent. After being on a high dose of adderall for so many years_ I simply assumed that making the transition to vyvanse wouldn't be a problem . Even though they are both stimulants_ they obviously employ different  working mechanisms. I was quite disappointed that vyvanse didn't work for me however I am happy to report that I have been taking parnate,F,47,2  months40 Mg 1X D,6/7/2011,Vyvanse

I am a creative director at an ad agency_ before I started taking Vyvanse I felt that much of my day was wasted starting_ stopping_ getting refocused and starting again_ especially during the day. Once I started taking it_ my work habits and productivity improved dramatically. I did notice that I could/would obsess over details of a project more than before and sometimes to the point that the obsession became a little counter productive. I did after a year on Vyvanse start smoking again_ after having quit for 12 years_ although I do blame it mostly on other circumstances. I smoked for about a year and quit. After quitting I noticed a bit of depression_ which I never had any issues with. I bumped my dosage up to 40mg and after two or three weeks felt like I was back in the groove of things again. I have now been on that dosage for a little over a year and recently been experiencing severe headaches directly behind my right eye; extreme irritability (I have a harder time controlling my temper); and the mood swings are more similar to those I had while taking adderall. I am now questioning whether the bad is starting to outweigh the good. I am going to try and lower my dosage and see what happens. I hope the lower dosage will even things out_ because I do ""cling"" to the benefits of the drug.",M,38,3.5  years40 1X D,6/6/2011Email,Vyvanse

231, 3, ADHD,Dry mouth_ Dizziness_ after a few months I felt like a zombie,"About 6 or 7 months ago (upon finally finding a doctor who would do more than just make small talk with me for 5 minutes_ then throw drugs at me)_ I was prescribed Vyvanse after being on generic_ instant-release Adderall/mixed amphetamine salts for about a year. I asked about time-release medication because while the salts were great_ I found the instant-release became rather irritating after a while - It'd wear off about halfway through the day and when I took the second dosage it never worked quite as well_ which was very inconvenient for my lifestyle (I can't duck out and pop pills every few hours).... He said that Vyvanse might be a good choice_ it would work for 12 hours and not have as many ""hills and valleys"" that the Adderall XR might have. I went from 30-40mg instant release to 50mg of Vyvanse. It was amazing at first_ I already was used to the dry mouth etc because of the Adderall so that didn't bother me.. The only drawbacks were for the first 2 weeks for some reason it made me extremely dizzy (to the point my vision would become dark for a moment and I was worried I was going to faint) anytime I exerted myself (which is not good_ as I am a professional dancer). However_ after those first 2 weeks the dizziness went away. Also_ the Vyvanse would take about 3 hours to work - which was not very convenient - but my doctor gave me a prescription for the Adderall to take in the morning so I could function - so by the time the Adderall wore off_ the Vyvanse had",F,19,7  months40-120mg!! 1X D,5/31/2011,Vyvanse

233, 5, ADD,,My daughter has been diagnosed with ADD since the age of 7.  She has been on Concerta until March of this year when we switched medications because we were no longer seeing an advantages of the Concerta.  So far_ Vyvanse has been a miracle drug for her.  She is a sophomore in high school and her grades have come up from Ds and Fs to Cs_ Bs_ and As!  She is even able to pass tests now which she has always struggled with in the past. Her self esteem has improved greatly when it comes to her school work.  We really have not seen any negative side affects yet. A lot of the side affects others are listing I also had experience with my daughter when she was on Concerta such as mood swings_ irritability_ irrationality.  A lot of that comes with being a teenager and it is very hard to determine what is teenage behaviour vs. medication.  I have always struggled trying to tell.  I can only help that this medication keeps working for her as we have 2 more years of high school to get her through before she moves on to the next stage in her life!,F,17,2  months30 mg 1X D,5/16/2011Email,Vyvanse

So I went to my psychiatrist and was prescribed 18 MG of Concerta. I took Concerta for about two weeks and I hated it. I felt moody and upset all the time and I had an awful headache all day everyday_ and it also didn't help me focus at all. So I went back to the psychiatrist  and he prescribed me 30 MG of Vyvanse. I think it works great and I really can tell a difference in being able to focus a lot more in class and being able to process things better. The first 2 or 3 days I did have a headache later at night_ but it doesn't happen anymore. I haven't had any problems sleeping or noticed shaking or anything like that. I have noticed a loss of appetite though.

Then that night I did not sleep at all! I wasn't even tired. The entire night I felt shaky and high. So I took a day off to recover some sleep the next night. The next day was a Friday and I took it again. Same thing. Not a wink. Then on Monday I took it and got a few hours of sleep but still felt out-of-body and numb. About two weeks later everything went downhill. It made me really angry and on edge. Whenever I was interrupted I got very angry. This was subliminal though. It wasn't until about a week ago that it hit me. Vyvanse is the problem. I never_ ever cry and I have done quite a bit lately. Also I have been so fatigued I cannot keep my eyes open two hours after I wake up. Even if I am able to get 8 hours of sleep I still have problems lifting my fingers. Vyvanse for me also wears off quickly. I wake up and take it_ become moody_ not get any work done_ and then it wears off three hours later.

It was originally marketed by the maker  to children under 12 years old but doctors have now realized an emerging market of adults to prescribe it for as well.

Have also had serious impulse issues my whole life: risky behaviour_ drug addiction just to name one( always gravitated towards stimulants). I know for a fact that since the capsulized powder is not wax-matrix granules_ this is an immediete release drug. It must be too cost ineffective to create a real type of layered time release pill form that say lowers in concentration toward the end of the day. Maybe too technical_ I don't know but I wish i had the 30mg dose feeling all day if possible as i often work 16 hours per day and cannot afford the crashes or mood swings reported. I have definetely noticed that you must take this early/immedietely in the day as it will prevent you from sleeping if taken too late in the day. Sonata does nothing to help sleep taken concurrently withVyvanse. Trazadone did however work well_ perhaps a good combo to study since it is an anti depressant taken at night which can can help you sleep. To be honest_ I am afraid of continuing this drug.

After about 3 days of taking it I started having internal 'conversations' with myself. It started out just normal talking to yourself banter but eventually the part of 'me' that was providing responses started to get meaner and angrier until all it did was insult me. It seemed to literally be a separate consciousness and even named itself. After 4 days of taking Vyvanse I was suffering through a constant_ and I mean CONSTANT_ stream of verbal abuse and scorn being directed at me by my own brain. It was like my internal monologue had been hijacked and set to the purpose of making me hate myself. The fact that I study evolutionary psychology only made it worse as 'he' knew all the things that I know_ and so I was at one point being mocked for the inefficiency of my left brain interpereter_ of all things. I put up with Gary (yes_ it named itself Gary; don't ask) for all of a day and a half before chucking the whole bottle of Vyvanse in the trash. The next day Gary was gone and I was alone in my head once more. Be VERY CAREFUL with this medication and if you're giving it to your kids be sure to ask them about any new mental changes. If I hadn't known so much about psychology that voice could have easily driven me to extreme depression and suicide. Once again_ BE CAREFUL.,F,21,5  days20 mg 1X D,3/11/2011,Vyvanse

He is diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome since about age 5_ with several other comorbidities_ to include ADHD_ OCD_ and anxiety disorder. At first I didn't mind this drug because he wasn't required to get frequent liver function tests_ etc. like the other meds_ plus the other meds made him seem like a zombie until it wore off_ then he was extremely hyper and up all night. His appetite did supress for a bit_ now he will eat around the clock. He has frequent wild mood swings now_ gets overly emotional over very minor issues_ complains constantly of dry mouth_ frequent headaches. Most nights he keeps himself up all night_ however the neurologist did have us give otc melatonin (a supplement you can pick up at any pharmacy) to help with that_ and when given_ it does help him sleep and sleep well. His school definately knows when he doesn't take it as his behavior is usually out of control. He is frequently constipated_ and when he goes_ it is always very foul smelling. Hoping something better with fewer side effects comes along soon_ I really can't help but wonder and worry about long-term side effects.

Almost gave up on my endless attempts for a purposeful life before starting Vyvanse a week ago; now I'm approaching tasks with a clear and graceful resolve. I was worrying about how this med affects my creativity and my ability to draw and design_ but so far- so good. Also loving the loss of appetite as it was approaching OUT-OF-CONTROL before. I suspect this headache I'm having right now comes from withdrawal from a diet that was worsening by the day on junk-food binges (lots of fried food_ cheese_ soft-drinks_ and deserts with every meal_ 40lbs over-weight). Now I nibble on salads and grilled soy or fish with a reluctant attitude (already lost 10lbs in 6 days). Also decreased sex-drive during the day; however_ by night I'm a porn-watching 'teen' again. I so can't wait to see the money I'll save now that I don't feel like stopping and buying crap on the way home from work every day! Focus and resolve has significantly increased at work and home. Excited_ but a bit worried after reading some of these other posts. My headache did compel me to google about side-effects_ hence finding this forum.

265, 5, ADHD,some dry mouth,I believe that this medicine is a life saver! The dry mouth that everyone experiences is expected because it is sodium based. Those that have horrible ratings that their blood pressure increased and they had severe insomnia are either not taking it for the correct reason(as in DO NOT actually have ADHD) or they are taking to high of a dose. This medicine taking correctly everyday will change someone will severe ADHD's life! I was all over the place and I now have a 4.0 GPA and couldn't be better! The first week or so that you begin this medication some side effects are more severe but give it a few days and if the medicine is necessary the side effects will dissipate_ the dry mouth is the only thing I still struggle with occasionally and I can tolerate that for a brain that can concentrate!,F,23, 50 1X D,2/22/2011,Vyvanse
266, 4, ADD,Better concentration_ more ambitious_ increased heart rate_ increased anxiety_ WEIGHT LOSS (noticeable)_ decreased appetite_ dependancy..,I really like vyvanse. It has been the only drug to work the best for me_ but without the extreme side effects. I'm a college student and I was recently diagnosed with ADD a little over a year ago and finding the right medication has been horrible. First_ I took Ritalin. The effects were horrible on this drug. It did work_ and helped me concentrate more_ but it made me feel like drug addict because one moment I was normal and the next it literally felt like I was bouncing off the walls. The worst was that it made my heart beat so fast it actually hurt.. Then I tried Concerta. Concerta didn't have as extreme of side effects but when the drug wore off I definitely knew. I had horrible horrible headaches that negatively affected my grades in the end. So I had to switch again..This time I took Vyvanse. And it worked amazing. It lasted from eight in the morning til about ten at night. I actually wanted to study and felt the urge to get stuff done rather then procrastinating_ like I normally do. I didn't get the feeling like I was on drugs because it worked so smoothly. Although_ it did tend to increase my anxiety. So when I was nervous for a test_ the anxiety was double to what it normally would be. But that didn't matter because I was actually able to pass it. :)It was about a semester after taking it when all of the sudden it just stopped working. I took it one day (the day I had a test too. ugh) and it just did not work. I was reading the test questions over and over,F,20,1  years50_ 60mg 1X D,2/20/2011Email,Vyvanse

268, 5, ADHD,alertness_ dry mouth_ cold hands/feet_ loss of appetite at first,I was prescribed vyvanse when I was a sophomore in High School_ now I am studying psychology at a university and I give vyvanse a lot of the credit to where I am today. I feel that I offer useful information on it because I have been taking it for such a long time. I usually only take it during the week days to help me with my work but sometimes on the weekends as well. It not only helps me stay focused during classes and on assignments_ but it seems to give me motivation for my work as well. My grades prior to vyvanse and on test days if I do not take it are significantly lower than when I do. Its calms my thoughts down a lot and I am practically not distracted by anything. It also helps me think more critically and in depth. I briefly skimmed other comments and a lot of the negative things said came from insomnia. My experience is that it lasts for about 10-14 hours_ so if you take it at night it will clearly make you stay awake. At first I did have a loss of appetite but over time you develop a regular eating schedule and its no longer an issue. The only problem I really have with it is socialization. I am normally a very social person: I'm in a sorority_ I love to hangout with my friends and meet new people_ but I feel like I am awkward and keep to myself when I take it. At first_ I did experience many of the side effects such as nausea_ increased heart rate_ etc. After a few months or so my body got used to it and it started working FOR me_ not against me.

He'd been doing well on Ritalin LA for 10 years_ wish they'd never changed it. This has been a major disruption in his education as well as our lives. I think the medication works differently on different people. Parents keep an eye out for changes in your childrens' behavior (moods in particularly) while on this medication.

292, 4, Adult ADD_ OCD_ Dyslexia,dry mouth / dehydration_ trouble sleeping_ gastrointestinal_ craving of cigarettes,"Over the last 6 months my doctor and I have been going through ADD meds to find the one that works best for me. So far I've tried Intuniv_ Ritalin_ Adderal_ Focalin_ and finally Vyvanse. The previous four either did not help me at all or the side effects were just too much to handle on a daily basis. Vyvanse_ which I've now been taking for 3 weeks now has really been working. The first major side effect for all these meds is loss of appetite_ which for me has been non-existent for me (a major plus). As for the over all effect_ it feels a lot like Adderall_ but not as intense. The intended effects are the same_ but without the big ""hit"" that Adderall gives you. And I don't get the ""Zombie"" effect with Vyvanse that Adderall gave me.So far_ Vyvanse had some great immediate effects that's been helping me with daily stuff. My memory is better_ I'm not all over the place as much both physically and mentally_ and am able to stay focused better and on track. My doctor had me take 10mg for 3 days_ 20 for 3 days_ 30 for 5 days_ and 40 until now. I'm moving up to 50 in my next refill. By introducing the med gradually like this helped my body get used to the med without any harsh side effect.The side effects I have been experiencing are as follows: First thing is_ about an hour or 2 after I take the med in the morning_ I have to take a shit. Everyday since I started it. I don't get stomach craps or uncomfortable feels in my bowel_ I just need to shit. (funny_",M,26,3  weeks50mg 1X D,12/14/2010,Vyvanse

I had been on Adderall several years ago but was taken off because psychiatrist insisted I was just depressed and did not have ADHD_ despite meeting the criteria for diagnosis. Although I have only been on Vyvanse for 2 weeks_ I wanted to share my thoughts and experience.I did experience several negative side effects up until about 3 days ago. The key for me was making lifestyle changes to accomodate the med. I have been making sure to get enough sleep. I felt much worse if I did not get enough rest. (I am a full-time college student in pre-med_ married & mother of 5 so I know how hard it is to rest.) Second_ I take the dose @ 10:30 a.m. after my morning coffee has time to get out of my system. Only decaf the rest of the day_ no other caffinated beverages. I also decreased smoking. ""Clean"" diet_ (i.e._ no fast food_ mostly fruits_ grains & veggies) is also helpful. I used an herbal supp to maintain my blood pressure_ which has stabilized & I'm off the supplement. (*Check with your doc before trying any herbal supplements.)My best advice is_ unless you are in serious cardiac danger or some other kind of danger_ such as hurting yourself or someone else_ or any other health danger_ try to be patient. Your brain needs time to adjust. Vyvanse_ for me_ has no ""crash"" period. I noticed some irritability during the first 5 days_ but it has since subsided.

I definitely have more interest in things (like my kids) that wasn't there before. I used to drink like a fish_ always wanting to reach a more ""normal"" mental state.  Vyvanse takes away the allure of booze for me_ which is_ in itself_ amazing. I haven't drank in over a month (nor do I even feel the slightest itch to) and I'm getting healthy again.  I would bet that undiagnosed ADHD would account for so many labeled alcoholics (and some drug abusers) that are just trying to self-medicate and find that more normal mental state.

So like all pharmaceutical companies_ they created a new drug claiming it was better because it was a pro-drug_ had less side effects_ etc.(side note: You would be amazed how little safety and effectiveness matter when a company approves a drug...as long as no one drops dead in trails...its coming out.)Note to parents out there...take your kid to a psychologist before you start pumping them full of drugs. ADD is very often used a blanket diagnosis when child acts or can't focus.Also_ with all the potential side effects parents still just blindly follow shady doctor orders and give a kid drugs.

I can't seem to complete one job before I have started something else - and I end up with multiple 1/2 completed jobs all around the house at all times! It's all I can do to get myself out of bed.

Screaming_ crying_ pulling her hair over the simplest things. It was HORRIBLE! I have never seen anything like it_ it was down right scary.

Now its like the instructor and I are the only ones in the room. My grades went from Cs to As. Being a single mom its extremely hard to focus on homework when Im at home cause I mean when you have ADD the only place you can study is an extremely quiet place without any distractions. Well my house is definitely not that place. with Vyvanse I can study while my boys are playing or watching Tv. Even things like dishes in the sink or a full dirty hamper of clothes can distract you from things you need to get done. My son grades went from Bs and Cs to As and Bs and his citizenship went from a 63 to a 97!! Amazing!!

A half an hour after trick or treating had already started_ he abruptly stopped_ and without one word_ he put on an old costume_ painted his entire face blue_ grabbed his candy bag_ and walked straight down the middle of the street all the way around the neighborhood not stopping at a single house. He finally stopped at a friend's house for candy_ then walked straight back to our house. His behavior was so extreme_ that I video taped the episode. That was the last day he took this med.

Heck_ even my depression hasn't bothered me nearly as much since I took the first one. It takes about 1-2 hours to kick in_ but after that it has lasted about 12 hours. Around 3-4 P.M. I start to feel really calm (the focus is still there though)_ because during the day it makes me feel very energetic and talkative_ but after about an hour of this down time it's back up and making me very talkative again. Unfortunately_ after that part I slowly start to come down and find myself losing my train of thought_ all the while starting to feel more like how I felt before I started taking it (i.e._ depressed) only far less severe. Yeah_ I know I'm a little too excited about this but I'm just happy to finally be able to cocentrate and not feel like a piece of shit all day :) Also_ the side effects that I have experienced so far do suck_ but the benefits out weigh them by far_ at least for me.

I can't sleep even if I take it more than 10 hours before I try to fall asleep_ I can't eat anything because of the terrible taste and dryness_ even the Tums I took for my stomach were impossible to chew. I also feel the need to shut my eyes tightly every so often and get irritated to the point of rage at the smallest things (e.g. tapping sounds_ gum chewing_ typing) which is so frustrating when I'm trying to study or do anything at all. The worst problem though is the anxiety I get. I feel anxious and nervous about something_ but as hard as I try to figure out w,"I usually take Ritalin to study for my tests because my ADHD is to the point where I literally can NOT be productive without taking some kind of stimulant.

I texted all of my friends very long texts_ and kept on having long talks with my mom. Yesterday_ I took a 30MG and four hours later I took the 50MG. I then noticed that I was chewing the inside of my mouth quite a bit. I put some gum in my mouth and that helped a lot. I then started tonguing the side of my mouth that I was biting. I had a good nights sleep. The talking was still a little excessive_ but calmed down a bit. The third day_ (today) I accidentally took the 50MG first.

She was diagnosed with ADHD but she is at the mild end of the spectrum. The difference in school was nothing short of amazing. She noticed right away that it was easier for her to focus and that the teacher didn't have to constantly reminded her to pay attention. At home I noticed is is more calm but towards the end of the day she can get a little moody but whose to say it's the meds and not her just being tired. I also noticed that by dinner time her appetite is back full swing.

It also caused me to be extremely over focused (didn't see people walk in the office_ hear them talk to me_ remember someone told me something_ etc.) I also began getting very annoyed with interruptions (phone calls_ people walking in the office_ etc.) which I always welcomed before. I also noticed unpleasant mood swings right away and wanting to be left alone_ to the point of isolation. I continued taking this medication only because it did help me focus on work projects. I noticed a slight decrease in appetite_ but I could always eat. Sleeping became a major problem after about a year and a half (without ever changing the dose). Because of this_ I quit taking this medication.  I seriously was unable to sleep for more than 3 hours a night.  I would actually get out of be and watch TV or do something else_ so I wouldn't wake my husband.  This medication is great for some symptoms_ but has side effects. Watch yourself closely!

It went away after I drank a couple glasses of water. STAY HYDRATED!,My friend is prescribed 50 mg and he gave me one. I've taken Vyvanse a couple times before and have had great experiences. I don't have any long term experience; but when I do take it_ it makes an ordinary day feel like being alive with a whole new energy. The night before I went camping and got 4 hours of sleep. I was exhausted and took a shower. It could have been a lazy Saturday catching up on sleep and doing nothing. But instead I decided to take the Vyvanse and live out the day. I felt fresh_ motivated_ recharged_ and alert. It really makes you feel like doing stuff. I took out my longboard and road around my neighborhood_ got on my dirtbike and raced around the backroads_ jotted down some movie ideas for me and a friend to make_ and hit on my drum kit for a while. It was a blast to say the least. I wish anyone who benefits and sees a positive influence while on this drug could be prescribed_ not just people who have trouble focusing or whatever.

346, 4, Bipolar with ADD,Reduced appetite_ some trouble sleeping if taken too late in the day,I'm bipolar with ADD.  Doctors considered mine to be a refractory case for many years_ and I suffered through many drug cocktails of antipsychotics_ antidepressants_ mood stabilizers and so on.  It wasn't until I suspected that there might be an ADD component to my condition_ and I insisted on trying stimulants_ that things really began to change for me.  I've tried several stimulants but Vyvanse is clearly the winner.  It is long-acting and doesn't produce sudden up and downs.  I take it immediately upon waking_ say around 7:00 AM_ and it typically lasts until 3:00 or 4:00 PM.  For evening treatment I take immediate-release Adderall; if I take that in the afternoon it usually doesn't keep me up at night.I can't say enough about the effect stimulants have had on my disorder--I've spent decades on too many of the wrong drugs.  Usually psychiatrists would not think of prescribing stimulants for me as they were afraid it would induce mania.  Although SSRIs like Zoloft have induced manic states_ stimulants never have.  Indeed_ sometimes I find them to be almost calming_ besides increasing my concentration and attention.If you are bipolar and doctors find you difficult to treat_ I highly recommend giving stimulants a try.  As I said_ Vyvanse in particular has worked well_ much better than Ritalin or Adderall.  You may be somewhere on the ADD spectrum and that can aggravate mood a great deal.

358, 4, ADHD,My son is 14 and he feels productive on 20 mg of Vyvanse_ BUT he experiences all of the side effects listed by others.  Loss of appetite_ too talkative_ more focus but sometimes its a hurry-up to do only half of what is needed_ agitated in the evenings and some sleep interruption.  I combine it with lots of vitamins and herbs and this works extremely well and I have almost decided that I have found a replacement for the vyvanse.  We would only take vyvanse 2 times per week because of the side effects.  With the herbs_ I was able to allow daily use even on the weekends.  I would never use Vyvanse alone because of the side effects.  And I think that is this much can be seen on the outside_ what more is going on on the inside.,We use the following herbs and vitamins in the morning:  Liquid b-vitamin supplement in a solution of orange juice and wheat grass/barley greens mix (1/4 cup)  This is for energy and general happiness all day.  Four (4) Neuro Optimizer Pills by Jarrow to aid with brain metabolism and cell nourishment_ this is a wonder herb of choline and phospodsterine (?) that makes most all of the negative side effects of Vyvanse go away.  By evening my son is not agitated at all and overall says he had a great day (and_ work is getting done).  I use a multi-vitamin_ vitamin e and a colon cleanse/liver cleanse for the acne breakouts - works wonders and hopefully will clean away any negatives from the amphetamine of vyvanse.  In the evening_ we add an Indian Ayurivedic herb called Bacopa (Brahmi powder) with Gingko.  This herb brings back energy for the end of the day to do homework and it wards off the oppositional behavior that vyvanse brings at the end of the day when the body is tired of being controlled and doing productive work.  This ginko formula of bacopa also contains mental harmonizing drugs like valerian root and ashwaganda_ so we may not be able to use it for more than 30 days at a time_ but it helps him come down feel energized to address another assignment and then sleep better at the end of the day.  I have not ran any of this by my doctor_ but I find that Neuro Optimizer and Bacopa with Gingko are life savers with absolutely no side effects.  They make him happy and well,M,14,6  months20 mg 1X D,4/28/2010Email,Vyvanse

360, 2, ADD (for my 7 year old),My 7 year old is almost 8 years old.  62 pounds.  Dr. rx'd 20mg.  We gave it to him at 7am and it should have worn off by 7pm that evening.  However_ it was like someone gave him a 6 pack of redbull and we were up until 3am!  We pulled it back to 5mgs and then bumped up to 10mgs all in the first week.  The night we went to 10 mgs - he was up until 11pm.  Typically he hits the pillow at 9pm and is asleep by 9:01pm.  He seems more irratable_ which just adds to (and makes worse) the  behavioral issues of having ADD.  I hate having to crap-shoot with the medicine... even after we tried other alternatives before turning to meds.,,F,43,7  days20mg 1X D,4/24/2010,Vyvanse

Doctor upt me to 30 mg. because I was so hungry all the time. Now I eat 3 meals a day and even though I might feel hungry I am focused enough on my tasks that I don't need to eat just drink lots of water otherwise I get a dry cough.,"I don't want to go without it.

Vyvanse has helped a lot with both of those_ and helped me focus. I play volleyball_ and it has increased my reflexes_ although I often get jittery during games. I started taking Vyvanse around the time I started working out_ so I've lost a LOT of weight. I also have panic disorder_ which I take fish oil for_ so I haven't experienced that either. If I take it too late_ I can't sleep_ but I usually just don't take it if I wake up too late. I haven't had any adverse effects from skipping a day or two yet. Hasn't completely removed all my symptoms_ but definitely makes them more manageable. My grades have gone up_ as well.,F,14,2  months40 MG 1X D,4/16/2010,Vyvanse

I took ridiln when I was young and quit taking anything all together till college when I started taking Adderall XR25mg I took that for 6 months and lost around 30 pounds going from a size 8-9 to a 3-4. It was great for my ADD and the only way I could have made it through school. I cant remeber a whole lot of the side affects since it was about 5 years ago. I recently got on Vyvanse and it has been pretty decent so far. I was taking it off and on for the first month and a half. I was only taking 30mg. I recently over the last two weeks consistantly started taking it every day and have moved up to 40-50mg. I can concentrate really well. I do have insomnia and some other odd side effects like occasional moodiness and thinking I constantly need to be doing somethiing but not doing it.

ALWAYS wanting to smoke ciggs. Loss of memory.,I started at a lower does but felt nothing.  I take a 40mg in the morning and feel energy and more motivated for about 2 to 3 hours and then I feel tired again.  If I take another dose_ the alterness lasts much longer but I think staggering is a bad idea.  I should probably up my dose and take one in the morning but I am seriously thinking about switching medication.  The one thing I really like is the loss of appetite lol.

367, 4, ,I lost about ten pounds signifigant loss of appetite at first_ loss of appetite has been reduced and I've trained myself to eat_ even though i dont usually feel like eating_ stomach pains during the first week which was accompanied by diarreah_ my body got more used to it by about the 5th day_ first day I was on the drug_ I didnt fell like talking and felt very anti social_ I've gotten used to the drug now and the anti social bit went away after about 3 days,It's helped me sleep better because I used to have a million things racing through my head at once and on vyvanse_ I can focus on just going to bed. As a side note I'm very creative I play many instruments and I like creating things. If you'r doctor prescribes you vyvanse_ then you may(depending on how you react to the drug) lose alot of creativity the first few days_ so if you'r planning on performing or something I reccomend waiting till the day after the performance to start the drug so you dont lose that extra bit of vigor. Overall I gained all of my creativity back and have written 3 songs and a screenplay since I've been on the drug. School wise_ I'll put it this way I was failing 5 courses because my ADD was so severe and I couldn't concentrate_ and I had a general math test mark of about 20%. Since I've been put on the drug I've had two math quizzes and 1 test. I got an 82 % on the first one_ 63% on the second quiz and an 80% on the test. I've started taking notes in every single class and teachers have actually come up to me and asked me if I had changed.

My bond with my wife has increased now that I can focus on her and have a conversation without getting distracted or impatient. I used to break promises all the time after ""forgetting"" something I said I would do_ when actually I was concentrating on something else at the time. My problems with procrastination were horrible_ there were things on my list or calls that I needed to make that I just didn't want to do; these are all much better now.

Vyvanse has improved my focus and mood incredibly.  I am loving the appetite suppression as I'm about 60lbs overweight.  The only thing is that it doesn't last 12 hours like I need.  I usually get about 8 hours of it and then drink a cup or two of coffee to get me through the evenings.  Hopefully I can increase my dosage and get the full 12 hours.

Sometimes I focus on stupid stuff (not suggesting this forum is stupid but I read through all of your comments).I agree with a few other guys_ when they were concerned about their penis shrinking but its cool; I'm married and havent used it for over a year before I started taking my meds.I get the cold limbs and dry mouth.  I sleep OK but then again I read up on putting my body to sleep by relaxing one body part at a time.  By the time I get to my neck Im usually gone.  If you have insomnia_ you may want to try it.  Start with your feet.I have always enjoyed going to the gym in the morning which_ for me_ really puts a positive spin on my meds in the morning.  I dropped from 162 to 145 (at 59) in a couple weeks but that was likely a 1-2 punch by Vavanse and a HORRIBLE bout with 6 wickedly hot peppers in Mexico.,"I hold in my pee a lot.

It's not such a bad thing though >:-).The most peculiar thing Ive noticed is that I LOVE to listen to Bohemian Rhapsody every day.  Its odd but fortunately I dont carpool or ride the bus because I REALLY like to belt it out while listening.  If you are one of the angry types_ you may want to try starting the day off with eating A LOT before the meds_ hitting the gym or going running (after about a half hour of eating your food of course) and then rocking out to Queen on the way to work/school.",M,37,15  months60 1X D,3/25/2010Email,Vyvanse

At first I hated Vyvanse.  I was tired all the time and couldn't stay awake!  But after I upped my dosage from 30 to 60 it worked so much better!

374, 4, ADHD - Child,Loss of appetite_ picking at skin_ irritability,"My 7 year old son has been taking this medication for about 4 months now.  We have seen a good change in his focus at school_ and when working on projects.  It used to be that he could not concentrate on something for longer than 5 minutes_ and now he has really been able to concentrate for much longer periods.  He has gotten into building models and Legos and that is something he did not have the concentration for before.  The negative side effects that we can see is that he has had a slight loss of appetite_ but we are able to control that just by letting him know he needs to eat and making sure it nutritional.  We have noticed that when he is ""coming off the medication"" at night that he can be very irritable - more so if we are out of our ""routine"" even by as much as 15 minutes.  If we can keep him in the same routine at night for bedtime_ brushing teeth_ things like that we have had much more success in controlling his outbursts.  One thing that has started recently that I will be talking to his doctor about soon is that he has started picking at his skin on his fingers and he has peeled skin away until it is painful.  His teachers are aware of this and are helping us to keep an eye on it and we are keeping the 4 fingers that are the most problematic bandaged (thumbs and first fingers).  Other than that we have been happy with his changes and will keep working with him to improve.",M,7,4  months30 1X D,3/3/2010Email,Vyvanse

I ended up doing my homework at the nurse's office until the bell rang and I went home. Finally at 12:00 the medicine wore off and I was out of my misery and I was able to fall asleep.

I was on 10 mg in the morning and 5mg at lunch. It made me so depressed and REALLY angry.  I feel like I had vertigo all the time.  My body couldn't get used to the drug.  they even lowered the does to half and I still had the same problems.  I started Vyvanse 6mos ago. My initial dose was 30mg because of my sensitivity to drugs.  It was not effective at that dose.  I've been on 50 mg for the last 5 mos.  There is a drastic difference in my personality.  I'm calmer_ even and I don't freak out and have melt downs the way I used to.  The drug has changed my life.  The side effects took a couple months to get used to.  Mt biggest problem is that I have increasingly become more and more constipated.  It's so bad that eating daily salads and Activia and stool softeners don't work.  I am currently taking Castor Oil 3x/week.  Not a good thing.  A talk with the doctor is looming on the horizon because you can't live on laxatives.  Falling asleep is so hard that I have to make sure I take my drug no later than 9am otherwise I'm up until 2-3am trying to fall asleep.  I found that if I take Ativan at the end of the work day and then another one at bedtime it helps me fall asleep.  Taking just one at bedtime wasn't working.

I got straight A's for the first time ever while on this medication_ and I finally could pay attention in class without zoning out. It made me not hungry for lunch when I took it after breakfast_ but when it wore off I was ravenously hungry for dinner.

Initially had some dry mouth_ but it easily went away with a glass of water.,Honestly_ I don't know how I have gotten along without it. I started it about 6 months ago and then sort of took myself off. I had forgotten it for a couple of days and figured I'd learned some new organizational skills and could save $30/mo for the prescription and just went on without it. During a routine follow up with my doctor I mentioned a constant fatigue I was having. I wasn't feeling depressed_ just tired all the time. I could literally sleep for 14 hours at night and nap for 4 during the day. I was having a hard time staying awake at work even. She suggested I try the Vyvanse back out again and much to my delight_ I feel great. My mood is better_ I'm more awake and aware of what's going on. Working at a job that requires a large amount of attention to detail_ it's been a job saver in the very literal sense. I had gotten written up once for failure to follow through on something I just flat out forgot. With this_ I am so much better put together. My office doesn't look like a tornado blew through it anymore. I don't have to try and remember things or where I put things. I know the answers and I know where things are.

393, 4, ADD,irritated if i don't take it regularly,im currently on 40 mg. im am slowly working my way to higher mg because i don't feel completley there yet. ive taken adderol and concerta neither of which worked at all i still had my appetite and i just got a headache on aderol. (i was bumped up to the highest mg on both medicines). this is the best so far. i do notice my apetite is not as big but unlike some people i am able to eat when i want to eat and once you are on it for a while you will notice your apetite coming back. this is a drug your body has to get used to which is the reason the doctor starts you out at such a low mg. i highly suggest not giving up on this medication if you are not experiencing any side effects because more than likely you just have to up your mg. take this regularly and do not skip days especially if you have moved to a higher mg. i have skipped several days then taken it again and it took me a whole month to realize i felt like a crazy person and this was the reason why. that is ALSO the reason the doctor slowly moves up your mgs even if youve been on a different ADD medication. My ADD is SEVERE i misplace everything i dont think i have ever finished anything. it took me four years to complete cosmetology school i would always switch jobs. people would get mad at me becuase im all over the place and I was wayyyyyyyy too impulsive. I am a lot better but not quite where i need to be. I don't suggest using anything if you dont have ADD becuase your body already has what it needs to succeed,F,22,7  months,1/11/2010,Vyvanse
394, 4, ADD,,(my last message ended with the word succeed and i started my rating letting everyone know i was on 40 mg)therefore you WILL experience major side effects_ also if you are experiencing bad effects maybe you were started on too high of a dose too fast or your body is different and this drug just snt for you. as for dry mouth that should go away pretty quickly and its not hard to cure if you remember to drink water. Like i said i think it has worked the best for me and i have been on it for about 6-8 months already and am very close to where i need to be. DO NOT skip days even if you are trying to save money ... its not worth it!,F,22,7  days,1/11/2010,Vyvanse

Decreased appetite (and subsequent weight loss)_ increased anxiety at times.,I have been on just about every ADD medication in the book_ and this has been the most effective one for me in terms of balancing side effects with benefits.  WIth all the other medications_ I have had to stop because of strong negative side effects.  WHat I have found with vyvanse is that it has a much smoother trip through my system than the others.  The first month or so that I took it_ it did give me a feeling of intensity and anxiety_ but I kept taking it regularly and paid special attention to the side effects_ and now I barely notice them.  The biggest piece of advice I would give to anyone considering taking this is just to notice how it makes your body feel-- for me_ the decrease in appetite led to my skipping meals and thus being incredibly tired and grumpy when it wore off.  So I started taking special care to eat a big breakfast before the meds kicked in and forcing myself to eat SOMETHING for lunch or snack during the day_ which really helped.  Similarly_ I noticed that the insomnia was becoming a serious problem_ so I made an extra effort to make sure I relax before bed/take melatonin and get at least 8 hours.  Cultivating these habits can really alleviate the way the drug impacts you_ and ensure that you get the biggest benefit possible from it.  Overall_ for me_ vyvanse has really improved the quality of my life.

409, 4, ADHD,Dry mouth; dizziness,Prioritizing:  I was always thinking I was lazy_ but now I wonder if the problem was more that I was just unable to focus on something for longer than a minute.  Things that I've been thinking of doing forever (but have always thought I just didn't have enough time to do them) are getting done.  Small things like cleaning the kitchen I would start it for about 1 minute and then have to move onto something else.  I've cleaned the kitchen in one shot from start-to-finish every day since taking it.  I definitely notice that I am able to listen to people more without interrupting.

I am able to contribute verbally and emotionally.For me the positives are out weighing the negatives! It has been great to read others experience_ especially regarding eating to stabilize and reduce the negative side effects.  I am overweight so I thought the reduced appetite was great. I would go through most of the day with out eating.

However_ with the help of forums like this (for me)_ the drug can mean a new life.,Again_ managing and getting used to the effects of the drug_ both positive and negative. Read others experience with the drug - Very Helpful!I would recommend Adult ADD patients to try the drug.  I don't know if I would recommend it for younger patients - the mood swings can be intense and may be out of their experience level. I have had much help in dealing with depression that I can sometimes avoid reacting to my thoughts when they aren't helpful. Also_ sometimes I just can't.

Having been prescribed Luvox 150mg (ocd/depression/social anxiety) and Clonazepam 0.5mg (as needed for anxiety) by my doctor_ I mentioned to him the procrastination and academic reluctance I've dealt with for years. He then suggested that I try taking Vyvanse. He spoke to me about how Vyvanse is an amphetamine_ yet it has less of a chance of being addictive compared to other amphetamine based drugs. Vyvanse (50mg) gave me a euphoric feeling when I first started taking it and this feeling still holds somewhat well_ but most notably in conjuntion with the Clonazepam. My biggest concern_ however_ is the rise of my blood pressure and increased heart rate. This may be a serious issue if not countered in a productive way (DASH diet_ jogging_ etc.) I'd like to say too that my focus level has sky rocketed. My test grades in college have gone up and I'm actually enjoying some of the subjects I wasn't too fond of before. My attention to detail is now above average for me (this may have put a hindrance on writing my essays because I look them over almost ""too"" well and it takes longer - still good grades though). I will note_ however_ that I work three 12hr shifts on the weekends (Fri.-Sun.) and I don't take the Vyvanse then.

Although I have had dental issues my whole life_ in the past 3 years things have deteriorated at an alarming rate.  I just started working with a WONDERFUL dentist who put two and two together. Since I started on Vyvanse 3 years ago_ the incidence of lost fillings_ cracked and chipped teeth and gumline cavities has increased exponentially.  I don't blame it on the medication as much as ignorance (unknowing - not stupidity) of the long term effects.  The dry mouth has never dissipated_ and I have become used to always having a beverage in hand and gum(sugar-free) in my purse.  Natural saliva contains natural elements that help your body ward off acids and other toxins that deteriorate the enamel of your teeth.  When you're not producing enough - other fluids DO NOT benefit your teeth and the result is what I have experienced: Lost fillings_ fractures_ chipped and broken teeth.PLEASE SEE YOUR DENTIST if you are one of the unfortunate people who have this side-effect.Other than the above ...

421, 5, ADHD,Decreased appetite_ weight loss_ mild irritability_ increased sex drive_ desire to talk frequently,The benefits of this medication have been well worth the side effects. College was difficult if not impossible for me prior to being medicated. Adderall did the job but with a great deal more side effects: severe insomnia_ rapid weight loss and overall dislike of any food_ decreased sex drive =(_ severe anxiety_ and the scariest was the heart racing and irregular heart beat. The side effects of vyvanse are NOTHING compared to adderall_ at least for me. I will be honest and say that I am not focusing 100% (which adderall DID do) but I'm at about 95%_ and I think that's good enough =)I highly recommned starting at the lowest possible dose. Don't think a high dose is better and will help you focus more because that's NOT the case. Most of the time you have no increase in focus - just an increase in negative side effects. On the flip side of that_ if you don't think its working for you_ don't hesitate to ask for the next dose up. Vyvanse has been an incredible solution for me as a substitute for adderall. Also_ don't count on your doctor to know if this is the best option for you - it's new and a lot of them don't know much about it yet. Get educated about ADHD and what medications are available AS WELL as what you can change about your life to help. You can't treat ADHD with pills alone_ it's got to be a life decision.

Too early to tell if the results are permanent but so far it's been great and the side effects are worth the benefits.,M,48,7  days,10/15/2009,Vyvanse

426, 5, ADHD,Agitation_ dry mouth_ loss of appetite_ drugged-feeling.  There are times when I feel like I have so much energy_ but there are also times when I feel like I'm about to fall asleep.,I started taking Vyvanse three days ago.  The first day_ it felt like a cloud had been lifted from my brain.  Everything was so much clearer_ and I could actually be productive.  Today; however_ I don't know if it's working so well.  I am extremely agitated_ and I feel like I want to go back to bed.  It may be that I am focusing on the lathargic feeling so much_ but it's not a good feeling.  Today I can't seem to focus on anything.  But_ it's only the first couple of days.,F,25,3  days,10/9/2009,Vyvanse
427, 4, ADHD,Headache_ fatigue_ heart races_ chest pain_ dizziness_ heart palpitations_appetite suppression_ but can so focus!,I don't know if I can care about what it does to my heart_ because i will be taking this or stimulants for ADHD for the rest of my life in order to get somewhere. I mean I don't like some of the side effects_ but honestly_ the benefits greater than the side-effects! And plus_ it keeps my appetite in check so I'm not a total fatty!,F,17, ,10/9/2009,Vyvanse
428, 3, ADHD-PI,I have always been sensitive to medication. I was on 30 mg_ barely above a child's dose. For the first two weeks I loved this medication. My ability to focus and energy were as they never have been before. Then generalized anxiety set in and lasted. Since I'm not someone prone to feeling anxious for no reason_ this was highly irregular and most unpleasant. Therefore_ my doctor and I decided that this medicine is not for me and we've moved on to the non-stimulant Strattera_ which I will report upon after a few months.,I am a slow metabolizer of medication_ which means this stuff stayed in my system way longer than it typically does for others. As a result_ I couldn't stay asleep at night.,F,39,1  months,10/6/2009,Vyvanse
429, 1, ADHD,My daughter was on Vyvanse for three days. On the 2nd day she developed muscle jerking of her leg. She has absolutely no control of these movements. She still has this adverse effect after three days of being off this medication. Her dose was 40mg once a day. Her doctor is stumped; we are hoping this effect will go away within a week.  I would NOT recommend this medication.,,F,46,3  days,10/2/2009,Vyvanse

You might as well do crack or meth because that is exactly what this feels like. It is not even smart to take as an ""SAT drug"" because you will be on the same question for hours because you will not move on until you are 1000000000% sure you have it correct. You will be writing a paper that should take an hour for ten_ and in school you will be obnoxious.",F,17,1  months,9/26/2009,Vyvanse
431, 5, ADHD,Loss of appetite_ slight dry mouth_ gas_ chewing on the inside of my lip constantly.,I had been diagnosed with a slew of different mental illnesses from the age of 16. Including major depression and borderline personality disorder. I have tried almost every antidepressant on the market to no avail. In July I went to a new psychiatrist and explained that my work and home life are suffering due to my inability to care about anything. I was missing atleast 1-2 days of work PER WEEK (surprising I still had a job huh?) and my anxiety was causing physical symptoms to manifest. Like ulcers and migraines. After hearing my barrage of symptoms and failures with other treatments he diagnosed me with adult ADHD and gave me Vyvanse. IMMEDIATELY I felt like a cloud was lifted from my eyes and a weight off my shoulders!!  My mind is clear and focused. I don't fret the small stuff and let it take over my life anymore. I feel like I am in control of my emotions. I have noticed that I do smoke cigs more often_ but I attribute that to being bored. If you feel like you want to smoke more because of the drug maybe it's because you're just sitting around and your mind is telling you to do something_ try picking up a hobby or just going for a walk. Good luck to everyone on this med. I hope it works as well for all of you!!,F,29,2  months,9/19/2009,Vyvanse
432, 2, ADHD,Looking for ANY ADVICE from anyone on this. I start monday but have serious concerns after reading everyones comments.,I was just prescribed Vycanse yesterday by a specilist for ADHD. After reading all these comments I am scared of what can I happen. I start taking it monday. Currently on Concerta and do not see any changes except for being rushed to er from collapsing ..Here are my concerns...I am a flight attendant so I cannot afford to have some of the side effects listed. I am 27 years old and I weigh 121 LBS. PLEASE PLEASE give me advice. My email is Cushing01@gmail.com.,F,27, ,9/19/2009Email,Vyvanse
433, 5, ADD,initially: nausea_ dizziness_ loss of appetite_ unable to sleep_ more apt to sweat_ racing heart_ easily frustrated at friends. - continued side effects: minimal appetite_ OCD_ decreased libido,"When asked what it feels like to be on vyvance_ I can only explain it as ""how normal people feel every day."" Before I started taking vyvance I felt like there was something missing. I wish I had started taking it years ago. Not only do I feel like a healthier more whole person_ but I can focus_ complete tasks_ hold conversations and it diminished my social anxiety. I would absolutely recommend this drug to others.   Only side effect I'm having trouble overcoming is the problems in bed. You might guess that it annoys my boyfriend more than my new compulsion of washing my hands 20 times a day.",F,23,5  months,9/10/2009,Vyvanse
434, 4, ADD,Postive: I am much more alert_ focused and can concentrate and comprehend the most boring conversations.lol In the morning it wakes me up basicly and it seems to make me pretty positive because I feel motivated to work. Negative: I definitely have lost my appetite_ I get these raging headaches normally in the afternoon (probably from not enough food). I think it may make me more irritable sometimes as well when Im coming off of it (probably cuz my head hurts). I do get dry mouth like everyone else and it seems I just forget water and food exist when Im on it.,So one thing to take into consideration when you read all of these comments is that Vyvanse keeps you focused on what you CHOOSE to focus on. Which sometimes it is not always what you should be focusing on. So for those who say they constantly think about sex or smoking_ its probably because you like to think about that often and so you will seriosuly focus on it as opposed to anything else. Which appeats accurate because the people saying that are around the ages of 16 to 21_ and lets be honest that is all you think about around those ages especially boys. I do not crave cigarettes or sex probably because I have many other things to think about. Same concept with the depression thing if you think about how miserable your life is alot then yea you will begin to fixate on every detail of how bad you think it is. So do not take it everyday if you do not need to_ plan a certain time of the day to always eat at_ keep water near you and take a tylenol when its wearing off. No food or dehydration will cause headaches and irritability I would think. Just be smart_learn to control yourself and you will be fine! It is a form of speed..so yea you will be dependent on it if you consistantly take a high dose for a very long time. Amphetamines fuck your heart up over time so dont take it for the rest of your life. I take Vyvanse so I can finish my last year in college. Anyways I hope this helps I have studied alot about drugs and behavior in college courses and tried a few..,F,23,5  months,9/9/2009,Vyvanse
435, 4, ADD (female-adult),3 days ago I was rushed to the hospital because I had heart palpitations_chest pain and burning_ dizziness (small heart attack). I was told by the doctor this was caused by the 70mg vyvanse and 3 excedrin tablets taken together. Scariest day of my life...I really thought I was going to die.I have taken concerta and excedrin together so I thought it was okay but I guess not. Headaches 80% of the time. Dry mouth. 15 pound weight loss in the first month...If I lose anymore I will be considered under weight.Increased oily skin.,Besides the side effects this drug is almost a miracle. I am able to work a whole day without looking at the clock every 5 minutes. I am more calm and put together. Concerta gave me insomnia and basically had the exact effects of cocaine (teeth grinding_ jaw clenching_ excessive talking and extreme energy) so this drug vyvanse is more appropriate for me seeing as though I work 50hrs a week and have 2 children.  My doc said I am about the worst add case she has seen and so the fact that this drug works for me is great. I do however have a huge concern now about heart attacks and the fact that a side effect is sudden death :-(.... anyone else have heart problems with this? FYI Besides ADD I am completely healthy and have  never ever had any health complications.,F,28,30  days,9/5/2009,Vyvanse
436, 2, ADHD,My 9 yr old son only took two days (one week apart)and had nausea and vomiting both days_ all day.,Nine y.o. has been taking Metadate CD for almost a year.  Did OK at school-good year-but at home (less structure) felt bored almost to tears. Would be very moody_ subdued and complained constantly of boredom.  Doc said to try Vyvanse_ but on just two occasions (one week apart) had terrible nausea and vomiting throughout the afternoon/evening.  Won't try again.  May go back to Metadate CD_ just for school days.,M,9,2  days,9/1/2009,Vyvanse

When I started taking the meds my GPA went from less than a 2.0 in community college to a 3.8. People in my classes were asking ME for help! I have been bulimic since I was 13_ the negative feelings I have had about myself had lead me to my drinking and smoking habits which have been increased since beginning to take the medication(mostly smoking). I started therapy when I began taking this medication. I am able to slow down my thoughts and think about what I'm doing and why I'm doing it before I give in to bulimic symptoms. I believe ADD causes your mind to be clouded with so many thoughts at one time as if your in your own world_ my mind is constantly racing but I appear to be listening and focusing on what is going on around me_ when I take the medication it is as if I put glasses on and everything is clear. I can listen and comprehend what someone is telling me without interrupting and I am able to focus on the task at hand and complete it without difficulty or complications. Vyvanse has changed my life for the better have been on 70mg for the past month and I think I need to lower my dose to 60 again because of my recent foot numbness.

Yesterday I got the normal light-headed feeling from standing_ but then began shaking uncontrollably for about ten seconds.  I recovered quickly_ but it was bizarre and makes me wonder how long I should continue to take it.,I have lost 47 lbs while taking vyvanse_ but I have developed an extreme dependance on it.  I feel as though I cannot sit up when I don't take the drug for the day.  Lethargy_ lack of motivation and focus_ and extreme appetite are all overwhelming if I don't have the drug.  The shaking episode yesterday scares me_ but I feel like I can't stop taking the drug.  I definatly don't think my doctor is concerned about the dependence I have developed_ and continues to perscribe it...so it's up to me to take the intitiative and suffer the withdrawals.Mixed feelings overall about the drug.

But I don't have side effects like muscle twitching like I did with the other medicines. I am still forgetful_ but I think that's just from smoking weed when I was young.  A lot of weed.  But I definitely notice the difference when I take the medicine.

I have increased concentration/alertness but it seems as if the bad side-effects outweigh the good. I havent noticed an increase/decrease in my sex drive_ however.

It makes me focus_ no more racing thoughts_ it controls my anger_ makes me more reasonable. The bad things I hate about it are_ I feel the constant need to organize everything (sometimes that comes in handy_ haha) and it makes me clench my teeth a hell of a lot more than i already do and suck on my tongue.. sometimes it makes me feel disoriented_ I tend to talk a lot more as well as smoke a lot more. :) Other than that.. no complaints :D,,F,18,2  years,8/18/2009,Vyvanse

I went back to my Adderall and the depression began lifting almost immediately.  On the Vyvanse I would get up in the morning and be OK but after I took it I would get so down that I couldn't function_ would do nothing but cry and was even afraid I might wind up killing myself.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone who has any tendency toward depression or panic disorder.,F,42,21  days,7/30/2009,Vyvanse

After extensive testing I was found to have a healthy heart. I was advised to stop taking vyvanse by the hospital because it has been know to cause sudden death due to CARDIAC ARREST. The drug has not been on the market very long and only one clinical study was done in adults before it was approved by the FDA.There are risks associated with a pre-existing heart condition. The problem is that some people may have a heart condition and are unaware of it. I did not want to end up as a statistic so I went back to adderall. I advise extreme caution when taking this medication if you already have a heart or valve condition.,F,30,2  weeks,7/9/2009,Vyvanse
454, 4, Adult ADHD,Only occasional anxiety_ some insomnia_,therapeutic benefit is not quite as even as the company suggests. I experience a more significant medication effect 2-3 hrs after ingestion. Yet less anorexia than other stimulants and improved affect is also present in the absence of an antidepressant.  I have not lost significant weight due to the medication but I find trainong for a 1/2 marathon alittle easier due to the increased boredom tollerance.,M,56,4  months,6/18/2009,Vyvanse
455, 4, ADD,When I first started taking it a year ago I had the usual restlessness_ started grinding my teeth almost_ and couldn't sleep for days.  I lost a good amount of weight_ because I was never hungry.  But that all went away (minus the not being hungry thing).  My therapist then upped me on my dose to 60 mg from 50 mg--not good.  My heart races and pulses so much faster than normal.  I'm not sure why but 3 weeks later_ like within the past 2-3 days I've taken a really bad spill.  My heart races all day long_ and my breathing has become really shallow and short.  I dropped my dosage to 30 and still has gone on_ so i'm off of it for the time being until my body gets back to normal...,,F,22,1  years,6/17/2009,Vyvanse

I think about it all the time_ and have become more experimental in my relationship. I like it much more than Adderall because I get the benefits while still being myself_ all my close friends knew when I was on adderall. Negative: Increased desire to drink alcohol. Dehydration and lack of appetite. Numbness in feet from time to time. Hyperfocus and rare stress/panic attacks. I feel like my penis shrinks when I'm on it and I feel colder. Most symptoms are less noticeable in correlation with how regular my diet and sleep are.,*** The key to vyvanse is regularity. It helps me sleep BETTER_ because I take it at the same time every morning_ and I get tired at the same time every night. I am good about eating regularly. EATING IS THE KEY TO OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE. I have TMJ_ and never have any problems with my jaw unless I'm not eating enough.Have used Adderall_ Concerta and various other ADHD and this is by far my favorite.,M,24,1  years,6/16/2009,Vyvanse

Usually when I wake up the next morning I can't figure out why everything was so intensely severe the night before.,I take 50mg time release and it works really well for the first couple of hours....mid-late afternoon I usually experience a crash and the crazy kicks in. Compared to adderall I think it is more intense...with adderall I still had a crash and often experienced mild irratibility but nothing to this extreme.

Vyvanse helps me focus_ and pay attention_ but some side effects suck. I'm talking to my doc in a week about the shrinkage_ thats the side effect that keeps bothering me. What? Should I go through life motivated and castrated? I'm more confident but side effects blow donkey dick. I weigh 155 lbs and don't get hungry anymore_ it got a little better after a couple days though.

Is this dystonia? Lost weight and some insomnia.  Depression in AM until I take my first dose.,It's been very helpful for fatigue and I do not feel so overwhelmed by life.  I am afraid this muscle rigidity may be permanent.   This drug works better then most antidepressants.  I am on Lamictal_ Pristiq_neurontin_ambien_and ativan.

461, 4, Adult ADHD,dry mouth_ increased jitteriness_ weight loss_ lowered sex drive_ teeth clenching_ decreased creativity,This drug has actually been mostly beneficial for me. The plusses have been increased productivity at school and at home. Also_ before I would want to sleep too much during the day and at night suffered from insomnia. On vyvanse_ I am active and focused throughout the day and sleep like a baby at night. I am currently pregnant and unable to take and my mood swings and sleepiness are wrecking havoc. The only side effects from vyvanse that didn't improve with time were my lowered sex drive and decreased creativity. Mind racing can do wonders for brainstorming. All in all_ vyvanse has been beneficial and worth taking. I do worry about its decreased effectiveness as your body becomes accustomed to the current dosage level. I plan to return to vyvanse as soon as my child is born. Otherwise I will never be able to keep up with my small children_ housework and college studies.,F,37,6  months,5/17/2009Email,Vyvanse
462, 5, ADD,"Temporary_ mild stomach discomfort after taking daily dose.  Clenching of teeth for much of the day_ leading to jaw and neck tension discomfort and headaches - all of which Ibuprofen remedies.  Dry ""mouth"" to include eyes and sinuses.  Already low sexual desire further eroded.  Variously irregular sleep patterns.  Occasional bouts of ""organizational mania"" (as another here said) that lasts 1-2 hours.  Decreased appetite leading to weight loss beyond that I have realized from regular physical exercise.  Constipation.","I started with 60mg/daily and have upped that dosage to 100 after initial ADD diagnosis (at age 45) 5 months ago.  The ""before/after"" differences are astoundingly positive.  I now enjoy the presence of focus_ patience_ planning_ listening_ awareness of and ability to manage impulsiveness.  For example_ though having an interest in Buddhist meditation for nearly 2 decades_ all previous attempts to ""practice"" meditation failed.  Now_ post-Vyvanse_ I have taken 2 highly structured meditation classes and ""practice"" daily for no less than 45 minutes.  The biggest benefit is that I can now understand and apply the lessons I receive from therapy_ friends_ support groups and family.  I can not emphasize this last point too strongly_ because after 30+ years of living with undiagnosed ADD_ I habituated countless detrimental behaviors on top of those directly caused by executive system dysfunction.  Nor can I overstate the new found ability to truly relax.",M,45,125  days,5/5/2009Email,Vyvanse

I am able to sit through meetings_ listen to others without interrupting and concentrate on my tasks.  I am finally able to fall asleep fast and stay asleep until morning! I have my happy disposition back! I have tried Dexedrine_ Methylphenidate_ and Concerta_ all with very negative side effects (grumpy_ easily agitated_ zoning out_ argumentative_ insomnia_ headaches_ nervousness and overeating.) Vyvanse is by far the best for me. It has been a Godsend! My only concern is the increased blood pressure. I started on 30 mg_ which is too strong for me. I now take 20 mg. Perfect!

Insomnia worsened a little bit_ but I actually woke up from the little sleep I had feeling more refreshed than usual. Over time_ things relaxed and the headaches_ dry mouth_ loss of appetite_ and increased smoking went away_ I've never slept well_ but waking up more refreshed has been really helpful even if I'm not really getting the sleep I SHOULD be getting.,Hang in there_ if it's not doing weird behavioral things like rage and bouncy moods_ then any other side effects will go away as your body becomes accustomed to it.

I sleep better that night than when I was taking it but I did wake up during the night with sweats. The next day during the morning I did not feel too bad but by the afternoon I was aggregated.

This activity consequently affects the sympathetic nervous system_ leading to increased focus/attention and feelings of euphoria. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system causes release of adrenaline_ which activates the body's ""fight or flight"" response and leads to most of the side-effects already listed.  Overall_ the drug is effective in treatment of ADD/ADHD as it relates to lack of focus and inability to prioritize tasks; however_ the typical side-effects of amphetamine use are also observed.",M,21,120  days,4/9/2009Email,Vyvanse

I went on Vyvanse to get an extra edge on school_ and it worked: it improves your focus & brought up my grades. However_ it comes with many side effects. Be careful students: it takes me much longer to finish exams_ since I often redo sloppy things and double check everything_ even though doing so doesnt improve my work (sometimes it worsens it). Vyvanse definitely improves your focus_ but if you become focused on one thing it's hard to switch to something else (after writing a paper for hours_ I want to double check and rewrite parts of it over and over again... it's very hard to switch to studying for biology_ for example). Even with all of these side effects_ I do NOT want to stop taking it_ the improved focus/enjoyment of my schoolwork it brings outweighs all of the negativities. It also doubles as strong coffee: even after an all-nighter it makes me feel awake. As a grade-conscious student_ it's kind of my miracle drug.,F,18,2.5  months,3/29/2009,Vyvanse

I'm not positive_ since I've only been taking it for so long_ but I think there's a crash period for me. I take it in the morning either at 5:45 (morning practice) or 7 and get really tired around 3-7.,"I'm just so incredibly happy with this. Everything I've tried has given me a horrible side-effect. Concerta and ritalin made me depressed_ and adderall disabled me to sleep and gave me panic attacks. I've read other people's observations of this being a very ""smooth_"" drug.

I've had trouble with joint pain_ specifically in my upper back and tailbone_ probably from sitting at my desk concentrating on work for too long. That has decreased after long term use. I have to force myself to drink water. After taking it for three weeks I've developed an embarrasing gastrointestinal reaction I've heard referred to as ""burrito butt.""

I would have to sit right beside her to keep her focused and normally she would still end up crying by the time her homework was finished and I would be very frustrated.  Her grades were ok but she struggled.  She always had homework because she didn't finish her work in class.  We started vyvanse in October and immediatly I saw a change.  She would come home from school and do what little homework she had by herself. Her grades are wonderful and she actually cares about her grades now.  The only thing that worries me is the weight loss.  I'm also worried about her growth.  I know all kids develope and grow differently however I think kids her age are passing her up.

I tried others such as Concerta & Focalin. Concerta was like speed and i did do good work but i crashed into a ton of bricks when it was over_ Focalin was HORRIBLE. I thoughtI was going to die_ I got very light headed and dehydrated quicker than on the Concerta.

Highly recommend eating first_ not too much caffeine_ and taking in the a.m.   I've lost about 4 pounds this week. I sometimes have to force myself to eat. This is helping me eat proper portions and eat more greens and less carbs.  I love this medication_ and hope the effects don't wear off because I have not been able to get anything done at work or home for years. This is a magic pill.

At frist I couldn't fall asleep until like 2-3 in the morning and I was taking my meds at like... 7am. but after awhile i was able to fall asleep regularly at like 10-midnight_ if not soon there after. This medication can give you an ""upped"" feeling like being high and if you smoke pot you stay higher longer if your on this medication xD. But if the frist day you take it you may feel a little high but that effect goes away.

I may have developed an allergic reaction--my entire body feels tingly_ there's a metallic taste in my mouth_ and the up feeling isn't has strong as it was.

The 2nd week I couldnt understand why I wasnt getting any erections at nite or in the early morning? The only thing I can attribute it to is vyvanse so I'm stopping today to be sure.

494, 5, Adult ADD,I had been taking 30 mg of dexedrine for the past 6 years before I switched to Vyvanse_ so I am not noticing side effects of vyvanse that I didn't already have with Dexedrine. Weight loss is the only thing I encountered with Dexedrine and it wasn't very significant_ like 5 lbs.,"I feel Vyvanse is better than the dexedrine. I like taking only 1 70mg capsule instead of 3 10mg capsules of the dexedrine. When I first took dexedrine and before there was the extended release. I was taking 3 10mg tabs like 3 times a day! I think Vyvanse is smoother to work and wear off. I don't get the ""jumpy"" feeling that I did when dexedrine would kick in and wear off. I think it works longer than dexedrine_ so I am still focused and able to concentrate if I have to stay late at work. On dexedrine I could read a book_ but only in parts. I would have to put it down_ do something else and come back to it. On Vyvanse I can sit and read the whole book and not once reread the page!! I think it works great for me. I think the key to both dexedrine and Vyvanse is to make sure you have decent meals. I notice that they both work better when there is food in the system. If you don't have food in the system it can make you feel a little out of touch.",F,37,2  months,1/21/2009,Vyvanse

496, 4, ADD/ lack of motivation,For the first week I had mild but obvious headaches anytime after about noon.  I couldn't tell if it was detoxing from 9 years of Adderall or just the Vyvanse.  Apparently it takes about 3 weeks for all the traces of Adderall to leave your system.  Insomnia has been the worst.  I can fall asleep but after 2 hours I am up and have an overly aware feeling.  That led to getting a cold and having dry eyes.  The headaches seem transient and are gone now.  I have been a taking a low dose of either Xanax or Klonipin at night to relax enough to sleep and that has been fine and am stepping down as my body adjusts to the Vyvanse.  Absolutely no jitters or teeth clenching or the muscle tightness that I experienced on Adderall.,I have basically been on Adderall for 9 years with trials of Concerta_ Dexedrine_ Adderall XR and Ritalin all with mediocre results.  I think that Vyvanse is the cleanest feeling drug that I have taken_ I don't have any jitters or tenseness like the other drugs.  I didn't think that I could hang with the headaches but they only lasted the first week.  It is worth sticking it out in my opinion.  I am debating upping my dosage from 30mg to see what I feel like.  At the height_ while I was in college_ I was taking 120 mg of Adderall and had stepped it down as the side effects were hard to handle- cotton mouth_ muscle tenseness causing headaches and occasionally the feeling of being cracked out- I don't think I ate or slept for the first 2 months. I am much more even keel on the Vyvanse_ had a brief moment of exagerrated sadness last night but so far so good. Will see if I can sleep without drugs and then maybe step up the dosage to see if I get more out of it.,F,30,3  weeks,1/15/2009,Vyvanse

If I take it on a full stomach or with a good multi-vitamin regimen I have(when I remember to take it first thing in the morning)_ then the bad side effects are less.  I crave nicotine a lot and it's effort to resist smoking_ though on 70mg it is less.  Food is key for this drug and it seems to be better.

It seemsto always be there when you need it_ and it's subtle in its effects.  I have tried Concerta & Adderall & Wellbutrin & Strattera_ and this beats them all.

I have tried higher and lower doses_ skipping a day_ taking it regularly mapping my cycle to see if menstruation interferes_ etc. and most days are great although my concentration levels are best when I am taking it again after having skipped a day or two. My MD had me convinced this meant I needed to change my antidepressant and I did against my own better judgment. Today I am having feelings of severe hopelessness and sadness and for no specific reason.

518, 3, Concentration,Eventually_ my blood pressure shot up in combination with my Wellbutrin which didn't seem to affect BP on it's own.  Once settling on 50 ml. per day of Vyvanse for now_ I've discontued the Wellbutrin until BP is back to normal and may try it again at 150 m (was taking 450 ml of Wellbutrin) as it helped concentration-wise in combination the Vyvanse.  I'll see what my reg. doctor thinks about that first.However_ add'l stimulants taken with Vyvanse_ such as caffene from two tablets of Excedrin or psudehephadrine_ seem to produce something akin to runners high.  However_ it tricked my body into thinking I was getting enough oxygen and while sedidentary with very limited movement (like sitting in car)I caught myself breathing very shallow which in turn cause me to yawn.  I then had to concentrate in taking enough air.  When having to return to Sudafed_ I will discontinue Vyvanse during those times as suggested by my Dr.,It has worked well but proceed with caution when taking with other stimulants.  Close monitoring of BP also suggested with hypertension - one of the first signs.  Relating to my Dr. about willing more easily to take on more at work and yet impatient in that I was expecting as quick a resolution clued the Dr. to hypertension.  A few weeks earlier while on the same dosage of both meds my visit to Urgent Care for a sinius infection showed my BP normal which is why I didn't have a concern of BP when visiting my Psych. MD a week ago.  He then suggested hypertension....and he was right.,M,,45  days,11/10/2008,Vyvanse

I have only gotten 26 hours of sleep_ I have had NO appetite at all_ I have to force myself to eat at least 1500 calories a day. My mouth has been completely dry. I have been consuming over 24oz of water an hour. And I dont know if Vyvanse causes the male prostate to swell? But I have had difficulty urinating. Brief spells of depression_ cold chills_ numb scalp_ tapping my foot unknowingly_ and excessive talkitiveness. I have also experienced side effects which I have not seen listed. Such as no sexual desire_ and since I started this medication my testicles have been drawn up into my abdomen. And my penis has been as though I have been in cold water_ It is slightly smaller than it would be at a normal flaccid state. I took this medicine for a full week as requested by my doctor.

526, 4, Adult ADD,Well_ so far_ the worst side effect is some dry mouth and a definate issue with getting to sleep at night.  I have actually decided to set my alarm for 4 a.m. and take the med then go back to sleep.  This seems to work as I am able (finally) to get to sleep at 10 p.m. or later.  Am currently on 30 mg. and having this effect.  Have discussed with Dr. and am going to back down to 20 mg. dosage and see if that helps. Appear to be getting some discomfort with my left arm too.  Not really pain at all_ but rather a pressure feeling ~ like the pressure of sprained ankle but not nearly that acute.,Before this med. I was constantly starting things and then not finishing..both in my work life and at home.

Currently dealing with a suicidal kid - major life drama that I wouldn't have been able to handle nearly as well without the Vyvanse.  I miss my super-high energy.

529, 5, ADHD/ADD Inattentive,Tad bit of a dry mouth_ small decrease in appetite_ slight change in sleeping pattern if taken any later than noon.,The opinions that you'll find in forums like this are often skewed_ because more often than not people only write in these forums to blame rather than praise.  Granted I have only been taking Vyvanse for about four to five days now_ I have struggled with hyperactivity and the inability to focus on simple things -- even things that interested me -- my whole life.  I've taken Ritalin in the past and it eventually became frustrating because of the constant peaking and crashing that accompanied my daily doses (Three times daily_ I believe 10mg in the morning and night_ and 20mg in the afternoon_ not too sure in retrospect). I have not experienced any crashing with Vyvanse thus far_ and only take 50mg once in the morning.  Most medications are going to have side effects_ especially those that are based off of amphetamines.

It doesn't work quite as well as Adderall_ but if your ADD/ADHD is a bit milder and you really don't like the Adderall side effects then this is probably a good choice for you. I also noticed that all of the people who have really bad side effects from this med have one thing in common (in this forum and on others): they're all children! I don't know if it has to do with maturity_ the medication itself_ or something inherently different in adult ADD versus childhood ADD_ but it looks like adults are doing great on it and kids are having a rough time.

I lost use of my left arm completely. Docs thought I had Rheumatoid Arthritis -- overnight!  None thought the Vyvanse could cause all these symptoms until 9 mos later - I lost ins. coverage_ only option was generic methylphenidate -- within 1 week of stopping the Vyvanse every single pain in my entire body was GONE~!  I could not believe it was the Vyvanse_ so after a month on generic_ got new insurance and RE-STARTED the Vyvanse and guess what?  The pain came back almost overnight.,Other than the excruciating pain_ this med is definitely a better all around med as compared to concerta & focalin.

Then he wanted off of them_ with reluctance we decided to not give it to him any more.  He is only mildly ADD and he was gaining weight and meds weren't being adjusted accordingly. His doctor basically said he was weening himself off by that alone.  He was off Adderall XR for 2 school years and then he now wants back on them a frustrating year at school last year.  Since he was starting middle school we thought he might need the extra help that the medication could offer_ we took him to the dr.  His dr. put him on Vyvanse 30mg (twice the dosage that he was taking of the Adderall) and to be honest I had looked at the side effects and wasn't happy.

Could not start anything let alone finish it_ my husband would come home and could find a trail of unfinished everything everywhere.  My life is very chaotic because of my ADD.   My first day with Vyvance was unbelievable almost euphoric.  I cried just to realize that there was another way to think  I had not realized how handicapped I was.

I was better off coping without meds and just relying on prayer for strength.  Day one I wondered why i waited so long to seek help_ today Im sorry I did.

I am on 30 mg_ and I legit can not be on it for more than two days in a row because the feeling is hard to explain but it feels as if my body is dry and shriveled. It is hard to explain.,F,16,3  months,2/3/2008,Vyvanse
548, 5, ADHD,cottonmouth_ restlessness_ decreased appetite_ the need to do something_ ha!,dear god i love this medicine. nothing else in the world like it. before i was prescribed this_ they gave me concerta and i had a huge anxiety attack. D: this medicine has helped me so much_ i can actually do my work now :] however_ i do feel kind of tired when it wears off_ and it doesn't last until i get home_ so homework is out of the question. it does give me cottonmouth and i find it hard to eat while it's in affect_ but that may be because i take 50mg and i weigh about 100lbs xDalso_ don't take it to geek out if you want any sort of sleep_ it's almost impossible to come down from. i take seroquel at night_ and it didn't do ANYTHING. but other than that_ i think it is the most amazing thing ever invented. thanks shire :],F,16,3  months,2/1/2008Email,Vyvanse
549, 5, ADD,"Some abdominal pain and somewhat of a ""crash"" on days not being used",Very helpful for focusing at work. Do not experience the headaches experienced with Concerta. Am on 30 mg & believe it would be more helpful at a higher dose.,F,48,1  months,1/25/2008Email,Vyvanse
550, 4, ADHD_ hypersomnalence_ depression,none,much smoother than Adderall XR,M,26,15  days,1/22/2008,Vyvanse
551, 5, ADD,SOME SLEEPLESSNESS_ STOMACH ACHE,MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS 11. SHE HAS BEEN TAKING FOR ABOUT 10 DAYS NOW. A TREMENDOUS CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. NO MORE FIGHTING WITH HER ABOUT GETTING BATHS_ DOING HOMEWORK. SEEMS WONDERFUL,F,,10  days,1/14/2008,Vyvanse
552, 5, ADHD,Jaw clenching_ slightly moody first month or so.  I did lose weight_ but that wasn't a bad thing.,I had chronic migraines for which I took Relpax.  Since being on Vyvanse I no longer have those headaches.  If I do get a heachache I can take regular OTC meds to get rid of it.  I can focus and get things accomplished....without going around my behind to get to my elbow.  It seems like the longer I am on Vyvanse the more focused and settled I become.  Oddly enough_ I have noticed if my children develop a cold or virus it seems to settle in my joints instead of my sinuses.  I know this sounds strange_ but it has happened 3 times since I have been taking the medicine.  Oh_ I actually sleep better.,F,34,5  months,1/8/2008Email,Vyvanse
553, 2, Adult ADD,Muscle Contraction in the neck shoulders and jaw area_ increased anxiety and depression_ and constipation.,The tendency to hyperfocus on the negative raised my anxiety levels to unrealistic proportions.  I felt miserable watching my husband who can do 5 things at one time while i'm lucky to do one.  Made me feel incompetent_ I could see what needed to be done(hyperfocus) but couldn't figure out where to start!  Also at the beginning of my cycle each month the ADD symptoms would return and the side effects would intensify.,F,49,2  months,12/31/2007Email,Vyvanse
554, 4, ADHD combined type,none whatsoever,I think it is a very good medication. But_ my dose is too low. I take 30 mg and weigh 225 lbs.  My doctor refuses to increase the dose so I don't know what else to say about Vyvanse other than that I have had absolutely zero side-effects.  It has improved my inattention and distractability somehwat_ but I can tell a higher dose would be beneficial.,M,25,1  weeks,12/22/2007Email,Vyvanse
555, 5, ADD/ODD maybe bipolar,Dark circles_ somewhat subdued.  Hyperfocused at times.,My son is on this since August_ went thru very intense behavior mod. program prior.  Now he is a different child.  I feel this is a wonder drug for him.  Melatonin at nite to decrease insomnia.  He is a kinder gentler boy.  Also no rebound tantrums after school for homework on a daily basis_ he was on concerta before and I think that made him agitated.,M,10,4  months,11/30/2007,Vyvanse
556, 4, ,"Euphoria at too high a dose.  Urinary retention (difficulty urinating).  Three-day ""crash"" after five days of use.",It's speed.  Sure_ it's time-release_ but it's still speed.  Makes me feel great all day!  I can sit in one place and think about going to work for hours now.  Got lots of great ideas_ too!  When it wears off about 10 hours later_ I forget them all_ but that's what speed has always done to me.  Not sure how long I can continue this stuff_ because after five days of prescribed use_ I have to take three days of recovery time.,F,44,3  months,11/25/2007,Vyvanse
557, 3, CFS and add,Noticed an increased heart rate.  Mild outbreak_ rash-like reaction.  Odd sensation of legs feeling cold and disconnected from my body.  I would have to touch them to make sure they were warm.  Very good at focusing your attention and getting tasks done.  Actually helped with the pain I've experienced with the CFS.  Gives you energy_ but you don't really notice any racey type feelings in your mind.  Helps to have energy and focus.  Helped my moods tremendously.  I felt very happy while taking it.  I had to stop because I noticed an increased outbreak in cold-sores.  I developed 3 while taking it over 4 weeks. I also had a mild headache when I started it and also a very bad headache when I stopped.  Overall though_ I found the experience to be very positive and would recommend it.,I did not experience weight loss which is thought to be common with these types of meds.,F,35,1  months,11/11/2007,Vyvanse
558, 5, ADD,compared to adderall...NONE basically.,just like adderall but without the awful side effects...no depression and no crashing.,F,,5  days,11/5/2007,Vyvanse
