0, 4, Focus_ motivation and drive.,Ofcourse I had the usual loss of appetite_ weight loss_ migraine_ upper abdominal pain and Insomnia.  After a few months most started to fade away_ pretty much only the appetite is off_ but I have learned to force myself to eat.  I also smoke and notice since being on it my smoking habits have increased substantially.,Has been a great ride for me at work.  My motivation is high and I am always on task...I always feel the need to get something done.,M,32,7  months60,8/15/2016Email,Vyvanse

2, 3, ADD,Loss of apetite_ insomnia_ upset stomach_ general uncomfortable feeling_ slightly dizzy_ light anxiety.,Writing this at 5 am as I cannot fall asleep (went to bed at 1 am with no sleepiness at all which is very unusual). The most prominent side effects are the loss of apetite and insomnia. Felt physical and emotional discomfort when the medicine was wearing off after about 10 hours (took it at 9.30 am). Though I did feel like I was more awake and could focus better the first few hours_ I still had trouble getting started on things. It's only day 1 but I'm already discontinuing of my own accord in fear of weight loss and lack of sleep as I haven't heard of anyone having their side effects get better. Will talk to my doctor about this in a few days.,F,20,1  days30mg,7/14/2016,Vyvanse
3, 4, ADD/ADHD,Dry mouth_ sometimes slight euphoria_ slightly increased heartrate_ fuzzy mind at end of day_ slight dehydration_ sometimes insomnia,This med has done a lot to improve my life quality. It can both aggravate anxiety or decrease it (in my experience)_ which way it goes depends on my own behavior: if I stay alone_ it makes me asocial_ if I engage people_ it does wonders. It helps me taskmanage. The sideeffects are primarily somatic and depend on the stimulant properties of the drug_ while the benefit is social and improves my overall succes in life. I find it better than methylphendidate which I used before this.,M,26,8  months30-60MG,6/15/2016Email,Vyvanse
4, 3, EXTREME sleepiness.,Worst pounding migraine of my life. One moment I was fine_ and the next I was incompcitated due to the extreme throbbing pain on my crown_ both sides of my temples_ and my eyes. I was also sweating profusely. I threw up so many times_ I can't remember the number. I was soaked from head to toe in sweat within a matter of seconds. Please help! Anyone else experiencing this or did? Does it go away? Maybe to high of a dose?,It really helps me hold down a job_ other wise I have a sleep disorder similar to narcolepsy and never know when I will fall asleep. Whether it's at my desk at work_ or driving down the interstate! I am afraid to go of of it for this reason_ but the headache/migraine was the worst I've ever experienced. Please help! Any suggestions appreciated!,F,30,1  days70,6/11/2016Email,Vyvanse
5, 3, ADHD,Severely decreased appetite. Increased anxiety. Lack of emotion. Insomnia. Increased heart rate. Nausea. Dizziness. Weight loss.,I have depression and anxiety. This medicine kind of mutes my depression but it doesn't make it any better. I feel numb to emotion. Which is just as bad_ if not worse than_ being sad all the time. In addition to muting my depression_ it has made my anxiety worse. I always have a pit in my stomach feeling as if something is about to go wrong at any given moment. When I have anxiety_ I get nauseous and my heart rate increases_ which is also what I am experiencing. But my heart rate jumps to 115 from just walking across the room and I find myself out of breath. My resting heart rate on this medicine is about 95 and I'm in good shape so it should definitely be lower. This is also a problem because I love to work out. I forget to eat or sometimes I just don't want to eat because I am not the least bit hungry_ which_ once again_ is a problem because I love to work out and extreme workouts in 90 degree weather on an empty stomach is beyond unhealthy.,F,15,5  days15mg 1X D,6/10/2016,Vyvanse
6, 4, I go 90 miles an hour the wrong way,The only side effect I can't handle is it makes the top of my tail bone ache sooooo much it hurts so bad like in the muscle I almost don't take it,But it's been what I need to help me focus and complete tasks,F,34,4  months30,6/8/2016Email,Vyvanse
7, 1, Severe adhd my whole life.,Always tired but I don't wish to sleep. Severe appetite loss. I'm no longer happy. Anxiety and depression. Blurry vision and muscle aches. Tunnle vision and a lot of anger. I feel completely emotionless. Over the weekend when I don't use it I feel like a completely different person. I stoped taking it for 2 months and I gained 10 pounds.,It is hard for me to get past the side effects.,M,17,4  years30,6/6/2016,Vyvanse
8, 1, To help focus,No appetite_ bad headaches_ body aches_ dry mouth_ insomnia,Although I am not prescribed and do not recommend using without prescription_ it didn't work out for me as planned. I've tried it twice with the hopes of better results the second time around_ however it was the same exact thing. Did not help me focus whatsoever_ I felt completely normal as if I never even took it. I do feel a bit off like out-of-body feeling but nothing crazy. And the only other noticeable difference is that I don't realize how talkative I am_ all I want to do is talk to someone while on vyvanse. Other than that it does absolutely nothing but make me feel bad later on with the side effects.,F,17,2  days60 MG,5/30/2016,Vyvanse
9, 5, ADHD/Binge eating disorder,Insomnia_ dizziness_ euphoria_ decreased appetite_ weight loss (10 lbs),Vyvanse is a miracle drug. I was taking methylphenidate_ first Concerta that was so ineffective and made me drowsy and depressed_ after Ritalin that was ok and finally Biphentin that was actually a good medication but not as good as Vyvanse. I can focus so well_ have more energy_ better mood_ more motivation_ can do physical activity everyday. The best thing is the fat loss around the waist_ because I'm way more active_ my metabolism is faster_ and I stopped binge eating like carbs. The side effects only last a week or 2.,M,37,3  months60 mg 1X D,5/27/2016Email,Vyvanse
10, 4, For ADD,While taking Vyvanse all of a sudden I started hitting my head against the floor and swinging my arms around and it would look like I was having a seizure I went to the hospital and they couldn't figure out the reason till this day I don't know if it was too much.,,F,38,1  years60,5/24/2016Email,Vyvanse
11, 5, Adult ADD,a few for the first day and then none. This medication has been life changing for me. I obviously have had ADD all my life but my parents were told girls don't get ADD and I had behavioural problems.   I decided to seek help myself in my 50's as I could no longer deal with things. First I was given antidepressants.......did not work.   Wrote the ADD test and my new doctor said I scored off the chart.  I sleep about 4 hours a night if I am lucky and went through the sleeping pill hell.  I now take 30mg  vyvanse in the morning and 10 mg Ritalin at dinner as the vyvanse only lasts about 9 hours for me.  I am so calm and happy now. I can fall asleep on it.  I no longer fidget constantly and my mind is calm (no racing thoughts)  I feel.........so this is what normal people feel like!    My only regret is that I did not start it years earlier.,If being calm_ less impulsive_ being able to stay on task are side effects_ well I will take them.  My whole family has noticed a positive difference.  Yes my appetite has decreased but not a lot.  I could still eat all day_ I now just have the willpower to say STOP.  I love that I have much more impulse control in all areas of my life.,F,56,10  days30 1X D,5/20/2016Email,Vyvanse

14, 4, Add,It help a bunch with school_ but I play football. And when we have practice I don't have any excitement. I feel as if I'm just going through the motions and don't have any drive to compete with my teammates. I feel like have become less aggressive. I was 245lbs when I started vyvanse and I'm down to 215lbs I'm not fond of this excessive weight loss.,,M,16,6  months50mg,5/4/2016,Vyvanse
15, 4, Adhd,Loss of appetite _weight loss but when I don't take it I'm extra hungry _ dry mouth _ I urinate & poop 50 times a day while on this & I don't eat oR drink anything _ insomnia,I hate the dry mouth & binge eating when not on it but I can see a difference in school and work when I'm on it and the weight loss is a plus I just wish It didn't have those extra side effects & the trick to getting your sleep back is by taking the medication earlier in the day for ex I take mines at 7 am,F,17,2  years50 mg 1x D,3/28/2016,Vyvanse

17, 3, Impulsiveness_ ADHD_ eating habits,I experience intense stomach pains_ extreme headaches_ loss of appetite and appeal to foods_ not being able to fall asleep at night_ either being very positive or very lazy and not committed.,I don't entirely recommend it. Yes t helps with my ADHD but the side effects are no joke and can impact your day. It's hard to do normal everyday things when I can't move due to an upset stomach.,F,17,1  months60 MG,2/23/2016Email,Vyvanse
18, 3, ADHD and Aniexty,No side effects really! I feel a little calmer than when I took Adderrall 30 mgs twice a day years ago!! I notice that it doesn't really suppress my appetite! Like the Adderall did!!  I also take Effexor XR 150 mg for aniexty!!,,F,52,3  weeks40mg,2/17/2016Email,Vyvanse
19, 3, Over eating,It lasts between 6-7hours_ when it wears off. I eat nonstop.,I was hoping the dosage would last a little longer_because when it wears off_ you'll feel the hunger coming back_ or if there's such thing as a booster.,F,37,1  days40,2/15/2016Email,Vyvanse
20, 3, ADD,Attitude change_ irritability headaches_ jitteriness_ weight loss_ appetite suppression_ dry mouth_ increased heart rate_,I was diagnosed with ADD in high school but was never medicated. In college I decided to try ADD medications to help me with schoolwork and time management. Vyvanse has helped me to focus and get things done but within 2 weeks of starting it I lost 10 pounds. I found that this worked better than concerta but that TRULY NEITHER WERE WORTH TAKING. I was prescribed concerta first and took it for 6 months. I had a lot of side effects with concerta and decided to try vyvanse to see if I would have less side effects. For the first few weeks I noticeably thought vyvanse worked a lot better. Then I started to see similar if not worse side effects. My mood and attitude completely changed on vyvanse. At first I didn't notice but my family_ my boyfriend_ and my friends did. I'm normally a outgoing_ loving_ devoted_ goofy_ and charismatic. However on Vyvanse I am jittery_ awkward_ emotionless_ uncaring_ unfriendly_ irritable_ and even aggressive. Not only does it change my attitude I can feel myself coming down off of it at night. Not to mention I get constant headaches_ to the point were every morning I take tylenol with it and at night I take tylenol pm to help me sleep. On the weekends when I don't take vyvanse I'm back to myself except I'm so sleepy and groggy that I can hardly function. Overall Vyvanse and Concerta are not worth taking; I find a positive attitude_ work ethic_ and adapting ADD by myself is a much healthier and happier option for me and everyone I am around.,F,21,3  months30mg 1X D,2/14/2016Email,Vyvanse
21, 4, ADD,No appetite at all for hours on end_ insomnia_ weight loss,It's the best ADD medication I've experimented with for school/studying. (With a presciption of course) I would stay on it but I have a really hard time eating on it_ but I also do remember the dose being too high for me. It was also my starting dose as well.,F,18,1  months60mg,2/4/2016,Vyvanse
22, 4, ADHD,Loss of appetite_ happier mood_ euphoria (starting about 15 minutes after I take the pill lasting for about a half hour)_ increased confidence_ increased sweating_ teeth clenching,This medication is not only good for ADD/ADHD_ but also for depression. I never thought I could be as happy as I am while the dose of Vyvanse is active. I'm much friendlier_ more confident_ and less irritable. I take it on days I have school (Monday-Thursday) and not on the weekends. Watch out for the crash_ it makes me pretty tired and burned out. Don't take it if you have plans for later in the night.,M,22,120  days70 1X D,2/3/2016,Vyvanse
23, 1, step mom thought I had ADHD,I didn't even know my own name had the worst withdraw symptoms I have ever had. Caused me to find out recently that because of my miss diagnosis I can now never have children because my body became severely under developed. I weighed a grand total of 83 pounds and looked like a dead person walking. I would never reccomend this to anyone giving this to your child may kill them in the long run parents. Or even better you may never get grand babies. This is the worst drug created it goes hand in hand with adderall XR. Please I beg of you use common sense when dealing with kids you can screw thier lives up forever !!!

25, 2, Binge Eating,This stuff makes me so jittery and I cannot stop cracking my thumbs and chewing on the inside of lips. My joints feel so stiff and achy. Instead of helping me control my binge eating_ it has made me binge even worse and gain 15 pounds since I started taking it a few months ago. I think the stuff makes me so jittery and nervous that I am constantly eating to calm my nerves or something. At one point my doctor increased my dose to 60 mg thinking maybe I just needed a higher dose. I was a wreck on 60 mg! I felt so sick to my stomach_ paranoid_ wired and exhausted at the same time. Terrible headaches with Vyvanse as well_ though this side effect seemed to improve after about 6 weeks. I am definitely going to try something different because this is not worth it.,,F,39,3  months40,1/18/2016Email,Vyvanse
26, 4, BINGE EATING DISORDER,better concentration_ suppress appetite for a little a few hours after taking it but it wears off.,It definitely helps my urges to binge_ but it doesn't cure it_ but i hope it will continue to do its work as i work to stop binge eating with therapy and trying to break the habit. It also makes me less anxious and my thoughts clearer but its not like magic I still have to work hard.,F,19,2  months50 1X D,12/20/2015,Vyvanse
27, 1, ADD,High sexual drive to the point of excessive compulsion and addictive behaviors. Living out fantasies when alcohol of any amount even cooked was taken in.,Get off it slowly and with help from a real doctor and not a psychiatrist. Go to theroadback.com and get on their supplements they helped with the side effects and it took me a year and a half to get the drugs out of my system even with this program.,M,36,4  years70,12/17/2015Email,Vyvanse
28, 1, Adult add,I'm doing this review on behalf of my gf. She takes 40mg almost daily during the school year.All summer she stopped taking it_ because she's a pt grad student and didn't need it. However as soon as school started and she began her medication she changed in many negative ways. First off she went from being a fun loving_laid back person to being on edge all the time. But at the same time emotionless. I thought it was stress from school. But when she doesn't take it on occasional weekends when she's not studying I get the woman I love back. So it's the drug. It has made her someone I don't much enjoy being around. When I brought up the fact that she'd been acting different_ like an emotionless zombie_ when she takes it. She claimed to not know the difference. Me and this girl are/were so madly in love. We would always get compliments like you two are so cute it hurts my heart_ or the way you two look at eachother makes me feel happy. But now shes taking f* vyvanse every day and is just not the same. And its a shame because I love her so much. I understand that she's fully invested in grad school_ but I wish I could get the old C***** back.,F*** this drug. It's evil. It changes people and makes them cold and heartless.,F,23,4  years40mg,12/7/2015,Vyvanse
29, 1, Adhd,My heart is pounding uncontrollably fast. It will stop if I lye still for about 10mins but if I even move an inch it starts right back up. It is pounding so badly_ it's feels like my chest is thudding. It's so bad it thuds all the way to my throat. So uncomfortable!! You can literally see how it is pounding when you look at my chest! What can I do or take so it will stop. Or even slow down_ someone please help!!! This is soo uncomfortable,,F,25,1  days40,12/4/2015Email,Vyvanse
30, 1, ADHD,Racing heart_ extreme anxiety_ overall uncomfortable feeling_ loss of appetite,I had previously been diagnosed with anxiety. After starting Vyvanse_ my anxiety skyrocketed. It was horrible. I noticed very little change in attention_ and at the end of the day_ it would wear off. As a college student_ I need to be on top of my game all of the time_ and that just wasn't happening with Vyvanse. I had symptoms from day one_ so I gave it a week_ but I just couldn't deal with the anxiety. I would not recommend Vyvanse or any stimulant ADD/ADHD medication if you have anxiety or if you need to be focused on a regular basis.,F,19,1  weeks25 mg,11/25/2015,Vyvanse

32, 2, adhd,This seemed to help my depression almost immediately_ but it did nothing g to help my focus.it gave me a little but more energy_ and loss of appetite_ dry mouth and irritability so bad. After five months of dealing with extreme uti's and yeast infection_ like I've never had in my life_ I finally narrowed it down to the vyvanse. I stopped taking it for a week_ and everything started clearing up. Then_ I started to take it_ and sure enough within 3 days_it was all back! I was peeing blood_ and had terrible pain during sex. I felt horrible!! Monistat would clear it up for a day or two_ then it would all come back again. It felt like my vaginal was also shrinking_ and not in a good way! Count in the chest pains_ and racing heart_ high blood pressure. This is not worth it!,,F,36,6  months50mg,11/10/2015Email,Vyvanse
33, 5, ADD,Fast speech. Racing thoughts. Loss of appetite. Extreme withdrawal side-effects.,Life changing medication. Helped many focus issues and greatly improved depression (although was not prescribed for that). Withdrawal at 75mg was severe and began within 5 hours after the time i normally take it. 50mg withdrawal is not as bad but still incapacitating.,M,25,8  years50 1X D,11/2/2015,Vyvanse
34, 1, Diagnosed with adult ADD,My skin swelled with edema all over my body to the point that I had skin weeping. All of the hair on my entire body sunk under my skin and as I tried to pull them out because they were burning_ my skin twisted and misformed. 3 years later I still suffer and now have no eyebrows and a twisted face.,I would love contact from others with skin issues because my doctors are baffled on how to fix this.

35, 1, ADHD,Vyvanse (Lidexamfetamine) is a potent neurotoxin that destroys the brains dopamine neurons and increases the risk of parkinsons disease and other dopamine related disorders in later life. Dexamphetamine (Active substance in Vyvanse) is the most reliable model of inducing permanent brain changes reminiscent of paranoid schizophrenia in animal models. Giving dexamfetamine for as little as three weeks to monkeys_ rats and all other species tested causes a 50-80% destruction of dopamine neurons in thr brain. This loss is permanent_ with studies showing no dopaminergic recovery over time.,"I dare anyone who has used Vyvanse for more than a month to stop using it and to see if they can still get the same amount of pleasure from life that they could before taking thus drug. A major misconception is that this drug is nothing like Crystal Meth. This drug damages the brain in an almost identical manner to Methamphetamine_ with the only difference being that Meth has the potential to also damage the brains serotonin neurons at high dosages. I have a Masters in Public Health so trust me when I tell you that Vyvanse_ Adderall and Dexedrine are identical to speed (amphetamine) and will destroy your brains natural pleasure and reward system very rapidly_ even at ""therapeutic dosages"". Type in on google ""amphetamine neurotoxicity in ADHD""_ ""amphetamine and parkinsons disease risk"" and ""Dopaminergic dysfunction in Dextroamphetamine users"" if you are interested to learn about the damage you have caused your brain. Methylphenidate (Ritalin and Focalin) are not neurotoxic and will not permanently reduce your brains capacity to feel pleasure_ atleast if you don't take it for more than a year. Stay away from amphetamine containing drugs if you have never taken one!",M,28,6  weeks30,9/13/2015,Vyvanse
36, 4, ADHD-memory issues,weight loss_ sleep disturbances_ dehydration_ headaches,I think this drug is very smooth and I can focus and stay on task..if I CHOOSE to. If i allow myself to 'follow' all my 'clever' thoughts while on this medication_ I can research and develop products and concepts ALL DAY_ and realize that I did not accomplish what I NEEDED to do. So_ my thinking is sharp as hell_ but my executive processing_ prioritizing.. may be in fact  be worse. When I am intensely tired_ ex: total sleep time 10 hours in 3 days. (I cycle through this every week) ...I can prioritize MUCH better. Something must be 'too' activating. Not sure yet. Vyvanse magnifies when I don't take care of myself. Too easy to not eat or drink or sleep. I work hard on that.,F,47,10  months60,9/5/2015,Vyvanse
37, 3, ADD,I tend to forget to eat or just am not hungry.  It's also very hard for me to sleep at night. I am constantly thinking and then have to look up whatever I was thinking about (e.g. I look online to see if someone created an invention I just thought of).,I do find that Vyvanse does help me focus and I'm able to accomplish more with it. However_ due to the side effects_ I'm now only taking it on days where I need to accomplish a lot (e.g. Setting up my new classroom).  At least this way I get some help without having side effects every day. I used to take vyvanse on a daily basis but lost a lot of weight in a short period of time since I lost my appetite.,F,37,1  years60,8/19/2015Email,Vyvanse

39, 5, Inattentive ADHD_ and Narcolepsy,Dry mouth_ dry eyes_ small loss of appetite occasionally_ a easier to irritate (I consider this less of a side effect_ as I was impossible to get angry at anything_ unless you messed with my food while I was eating it.),Okay I am gonna explain my experience in as much detail as possible. The first week I took vyvanse I was on 20mg_ Pros: I noticed improved concentration_ alertness_ and memory of AFTER I started taking it. Cons: anything before I started taking it was easily forgotten_ or hard to remember_ got dehydrated faster_ don't eat often_ but when I did it was a lot more then normal. After the first week or so_ my memory fixed its self_ I got used to drinking more liquids_ and less but larger meals. After that only thing I noticed was I needed a stronger prescription. As for the memory thing_ I talked to my specialist about it_ and he explained it to me_ and I came to the same conclusion_ but he said I explained it better. Sorry i could not fit everthing_ so If you have any questions feel free to email me_ I am no doctor but i have a lot of personal experience dealing with sleep_ eating habits_ and all the bad things the medication causes.,M,20,1  months20-30mg,8/2/2015Email,Vyvanse

It worked wonders at work yesterday and I was just working my butt off.  And I do intermittent fasting for weight loss so the curbed appetite just helps me even more. But an hour and a half ago I woke up and couldn't sleep.  And just about 30 mins ago I was on the toilet and didn't know if I had to use the bathroom or just throw up_ then had major diarrhea.

42, 5, Increased alertness and mood,I started feeling relief almost instantaneously. My mood and alertness improved just a few days after I began taking the medicine.The side effects didn't all start at once.  The first side effect I noticed was weight loss.  A week or so after that was decreased appetite.  The side effect that has had the most significant effect on me is my increased libido.  I mean_ I'm wanting to be with my husband 2 and 3 times a day.Most importantly Vyvanse is working as prescribed by my doctor.  My mood has been lifted and I'm more alert.,,F,32,2  months40 MG 1X D,7/23/2015,Vyvanse
43, 4, ADHD,A few negative side affects kept me from giving this a 5. They are the extreme headaches and bouts of anger I have if I don't have a high protein diet while on it. I also go from smoking a cigarette once every 4-6 hours to smoking once every 15-30 minutes (about 20x more). I can NOT quit smoking while taking Vyvanse.,Improves focus. You have to have the desire to organize for it to improve organization_ you have to have the desire to do your work for it to help you finish the work and act.WARNING: Do NOT let ANYONE know your prescribed Vyvanse unless you have to (i.e.doctors) or else people will bother you about giving or selling them to them or they may even steal them from you.,F,19,4  years60mg,7/18/2015,Vyvanse
44, 5, adult ADD (had it as a kid also),in the very beginning I could not sleep well if not at all for the first couple days.  I took all natural melatonin_ and the next day was fine.  My appetite is defiantly diminished_ but it's not as if I can't eat_ it just makes me content with portion sizes.,I have a heart condition and found that this medicine does not affect it.  I lost my job after not meeting my quota due to ADD.  I was always in the military so I could only take strattera (which did not help at all!) I retired from the Reserves and was able to try a stimulant based medicine again.  Unfortunately prior to my appointment to get on Meds I got fired for not reaching my quota.  After I got established with vyvanse I am able to focus_ and concentrate on my new job.  It gives me an euphoric feeling almost as a low dose of an anti-depressant.  Whe I was young I was on Ritalin and experienced anger_ depression_ and crashing.  I have not seen that with this.  My 8 year old daughter was diagnosed with ADD also this past month.

45, 4, Adult ADHD,Nausea_ dry mouth,I am able to focus and get multiple tasks done throughout the day. I did feel nausea at first_ but it subsided after I started taking Vyvanse with food. It has significantly decreased my appetite_ which has helped me drop a few pounds. It is easy for me to get dehydrated on it_ so I drink water throughout the day. Overall_ the benefits have outweighed the side effects.,M,31,2  months40MG 1X D,6/3/2015,Vyvanse
46, 4, ADD,Nausea_ loss of appetite_ weight loss.,Vyvanse clears my mind_ thats the main benefit_ for me. I'm plagued by my thoughts. To say I would over think is an understatement. My mind was never free_ ever! I was a prisoner in my own mind. It was hard being me but that's the only me I knew until I finally gave in and spoke to a therapist who suggested I talk to Psychiatrist who could better help me. I was beyond hesitant - I don't even take Advil if I can help it. I was tired and completely defeated so I gave it a shot and voila... a new me! I was diagnosed with ADD but what Vyvanse really does for me is clear my mind - I can watch a movie and actually pay attention and NOT think about what i need to do tomorrow or what i should have done today or said to someone yesterday. Vyvanse has worked for me BUT only at 40 mg - anything more made me agitated and jittery. Nausea was prevalent the first little while but once that finally subsided I had extreme loss of appetite - that lasted for a good 6 months. Now_ almost a year in... my appetite is back to normal.,F,35,1  years40 MG 1X D,5/28/2015,Vyvanse

48, 1, ADD/ADHD,Anorexia_ depression_ head aches_ stomach aches_ irritability_ messed up sleep patterns_ really bad dry mouth_ severe dizziness_ confusion_ bad memory_ trouble forming sentences(stuttering_) nausea_ diarrhea_ minor hair loss_ major weight loss.,I've only been taking Vyvanse for a week and three days but instead of making me feel concentrated I just constantly focus on the wrong things_ get confused_ forget what I'm saying mid sentence_ and forget basic stuff I need to remember for school. I constantly want to punch someone_ or cry in a ball on the floor. My throat is so dry to the point I almost can't even swallow my spit. My sleep pattern is so messed up some nights I go to bed at two A.M and others at 6 P.M. I've hardly eaten_ and lost over 10 pounds in just over a week_ and when I do try to eat I feel sick for hours. I can't property form a full sentence because my mouth gets to dry_ or I start stuttering. My stomach and head hurt really badly for at least a few hours everyday. The worst part is my grades went from_ B C C D F_ to F D D F F. Everything sucks and I hate these meds,F,14,1  weeks40MG,5/8/2015Email,Vyvanse

50, 5, ADD/ADHD,1. If I take Vyvanse later than 10 AM_ I can't sleep until 1 AM. Fortunately I take it between 5:30 and 7 AM. 2. When I come off of it_ I'm exhausted_ especially if I get less than 8 hrs of sleep the night before3. I have more joint pain in my knees and feet. I thought it was just me_ but then I got stomach flu and couldn't take Vyvanse for 4 days. The joint pain went away. I find that sleeping for 10-11 hrs on Fri or Sat night helps with the joint pain temporarily.,This med has enabled me to excel and work and get promotions and raises. Without it I am constantly distracted by what's going on in my environment_ fidget constantly and day dream. I also can't think clearly. When I started taking vyvanse_ it took about a week to get used to it. I had sleeplessness and aggression for a week_ the it got better_ but I would lose focus at around 2 PM. I upped my dosage from 20 to 30 mg and it settled down. I am much more confident_ can focus on multiple things at a time and deal with interruptions without forgetting what what I was doing or going on a wild goose chase. It really has improved my quality of life overall. Now I actually have motivation to get things done.,F,39,1  years30 mg,4/8/2015,Vyvanse
51, 5, Cuz I'm an amphetamine addict,Loss of appetite_ dry mouth_ racing thoughts_ impulse to write rhymes_ clean my room and play COD_ all goes away after a month,This shits the bees knees. Don't take more than you need or it's like smoking crack... I assume.  You can always up the dose_ but too much off the bat will make you nervous and shaky.  Once you metabolism syncs up with the medicine it's all smooth sailing and productivity. Ps not really an amphetamine addict. ADHD.,M,23,4  years60,3/17/2015,Vyvanse
52, 5, Anxiety_ Depression_ Obs thoughts,Very slight dry mouth,For the past year and half I've been dealing with anxiety and obsessive thoughts that I believe led to severe depression.  Got a new doctor and he prescribed vyvanse as a way to get my anxiety under control. I was feeling overwhelmed with anxiety and couldn't focus or concentrate.  I took it this morning and didn't feel any difference but when I got to work I realized that for the first time in a long time my mind was quiet. No worrying_ no recurring thoughts_ no anxiety. I was actually productive and_ dare I say_ content. I don't know if it's a fluke or not but_ at least for today_ I feel great. I actually want to work and spend time with my family. That hadn't happened in over a year. If it continues_ this drug will be responsible for getting my life back.  Keeping my fingers crossed.,M,47,1  days30 1X D,2/17/2015,Vyvanse
53, 5, ADD,Loss of appetite for sure_ I'll get a head ache if I forget to take it but other than that nothing else.,I have been struggling with ADD through out my life and I've literally tried everything and I mean everything_ and stopped about 6th grade_ I didn't take any ADD medication throughout highschool till a couple weeks ago and I've been struggling with my classes until I started taking Vyvanse I brought my 49% in geometry to a 72% within a matter of weeks. this is the second year taking the class and its never been easier to understand_ still a hard subject for me but not too bad anymore. Just over all I've never been more satisfied with a ADD pill I actually like taking it and I used to hate taking pills everyday.,M,17,3  weeks60 mg,2/12/2015Email,Vyvanse
54, 3, Menapause ADD,It actually worked for my ADD_ and I liked how it kept me on an even kill all day. No ups and downs like the Adderall I had been on for over a year. But side effects were bad.,Side effect after 30 days were horrible and I did not realize until  after I quit taking it that it was the Vyvanse_ Muscle pain in my wrist_ elbows_ shoulders and neck .Had even gone to an Orthopedic to find out what was going on.  VERY dry skin. thirsty all the time. Lost weight (which I can't afford to lose) Thought I was going nuts. I have OCD also_ but its organization OCD_ and on Vyvanse I couldn't care less about my files or office or anything. My hands and feet normally stay cold but they were a lot colder and felt like I was freezing all the time. I will not continue to take it. I will go back to Adderall.,F,49,30  days15 1X D,2/10/2015,Vyvanse
55, 4, ADHD,If I eat well and drink enough water that day_ Vyvanse has no negative side effects for me.,If you are experiencing major come down from taking this drug_ such as feeling prolonged anxiety/depression I suggest you talk to your doctor about trying a different ADHD med.

56, 5, ADD,Loss of appetite. Wake up feeling hung over. Insomnia. Extremely tired before taking in the morning. Nausea,The first night was hell. Day two I slept quicker. Wake up and you feel useless. The loss of appetite isn't bad. I still eat what I normally use to because once I eat my appetite grows just enough to allow me to finish. DRINK WATER LOTS or you'll be stuck with nausea. The only real problem at the moment for me is the mornings. Everything else is just something that I've gone through which was much worse when I was younger due to adhd. So far there are more positives than negatives to this drug and the side effects are slowly going away especially the insomnia. I can now focus properly and only daydream for 20% of the school day instead of 75%. When I first took it and went into my most difficult class that I was failing because I didn't pay attention  it took me less than an hour to learn that the class I was failing was actually the easiest one.,M,17,3  days20mg,1/31/2015,Vyvanse
57, 4, Adhd,Unable to sleep at first_ hunger loss,I was 16 when prescribed vyvanse. Before taking vyvanse I would smoke weed atleast once a day I loved smoking and had no plans to quit. After taking vyvanse I've had no urge to smoke at all. My grades in school have improved significantly. And I like the person I am on it allot better on vyvanse. The first few days was where the side effects were hitting me the most such as not being hungry_ the first 2 days I got almost no sleep but after that this drug has worked for me awesome. I was scared to medicate myself but I can honestly say I'm glad I did and wish I did it sooner.,M,17,8  months50mg,1/6/2015,Vyvanse
58, 5, ADHD_ Disthymia_ Affective Disorder,Initially_ insomnia_ excitedness_ dry mouth.  All disappeared after a few weeks.,I've tried many medications over the past 20 years_ and none has been as effective as Vyvanse.  I've also taken dextroamphetamine spansules which had great results as well_ but Vyvanse seems smoother.  Great focus_ moods are stable_ increased libido_ and welcomed and gradual weight loss.  I no longer obsess over trivial things_ and am more outgoing and confident.  I get a greater satisfaction over any and all accomplishments_ which are many as a result of this med.  I look forward to the future and stopped dwelling on the negative past.  I'm more organized and methodical.  Overall_ great success.,M,55,6  months80mg 1X D,12/23/2014,Vyvanse
59, 4, ADHD - Inattentive type,Sweaty palms_ hyper focus_ talkative_ lack of appetite_ dehydration_ extreme highs (giddy_ elated feeling)_ and lows when coming off it_ insomnia_ diarrhea/upset stomach_ anxiety_ irritability,While the drug is and has been extremely helpful (which is why I've relied on it for so long)_ I am starting to deal with some of the long term effects. The biggest issue is that I'm severely dehydrated_ no matter how much water I drink - which had led to issues with low blood pressure. From about the time I wake up until the time I take my medication (around 11 am_ so I'll have an appetite for lunch)_ I feel nauseous_ dizzy_ lightheaded and extremely irritable. I also experience extreme exhaustion (I once slept 24+ hours when I didn't take it) and overeating. I can also confirm other reviews of extreme highs and lows.. When I've taken it_ I find myself getting really excited and spending hours focusing on one task_ then at the end of the day feeling extremely depressed and wondering why the heck I wasted so much time on that one task all day). The side effects I experience while on the prescription don't seem so bad compared to those while off it_ which is why I've been unable to stop taking it for so long (I take 1 each day_ or else lose a day to sleep - not to mention the forgetfulness & distractibility that return each time). Unfortunately_ I'm recently married and hoping to have kids so I'll have to deal with the consequences of trying to wean myself off of it. SUMMARY: great drug for immediate ADHD relief_ but not a good long-term solution.,F,26,7  years50,12/7/2014Email,Vyvanse
