1, 1, respiratory/bronchial infection,severe nausea_ vomiting_ severe headache_ blurred vision_ dizziness_ delayed yeast infection,A couple of hours after taking just one dose_ it made me feel worse than I was already feeling.  I also broke out in a severe skin yeast infection after taking it- totally miserable- imagine feeling like you have millions of microscopic bugs crawling all over you!!!  It seems to have affected my immune system.  It has been a couple of years now since taking it and now I suffer from chronic yeast infections anytime I take any antibiotic- even antibiotic ointment!,F,33,1  times,12/15/2007Email,Ketek
2, 1, sinus infection,None except the anxiety about possible compromised liver function.,Ketek cured my sinus infection but other meds probably would have done the same thing without the dangers.  My Doc is too free with the samples from the Pharm. Cos. I was not a happy patient and let him know not to do that again.,M,66,5  days,10/3/2007,Ketek
3, 4, Throat and respiratory infection,None. Didn't notice any side effects.,It cured my throat infection and seems to have helped my respiratory infection - doesn't hurt anymore - but I'm still coughing quite a bit and producing lots of phlegm. I'm going to my doctor to see if I should try something else now.,F,39,5  days,8/29/2007,Ketek
4, 1, bronchitis_ sinusitis,severe abdominal pain_ painful urination_ flushing_ headache_ blurred vision_ double vision_ insomnia,This stuff did absolutely nothing for my sinusitis or bronchitis two years ago. It is no longer approved for these conditions due to people dying from liver failure_ and should never have been approved for any condition by the FDA who knew its safety studies were compromised by fraudulent data.,F,34,2  days,8/26/2007,Ketek
5, 1, bronchitis,tingling / numbness in hands & arms,,F,33,2  days,6/22/2007,Ketek
