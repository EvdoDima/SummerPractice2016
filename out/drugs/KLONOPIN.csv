2, 5, Panic attacks,I became physically addicted to low--dose (.5mg)  Klonopin after about a year of use - and I couldn't care less.,I am physically addicted to Klonopin and I couldn't care less. I mean_ if I had diabetes I would need an insulin shot to function and I see no difference. I am allergic to SSRI's and Marijuana induces panic attacks for me so I have no alternative.  I take a small dose - .5 Mg - and have never had to increase it to get the therapeutic benefit I need.  My panic attacks were so severe I was close to suicide. After suffering for 20 years I was ready to give up when a British psychiatrist new to the US scoffed at my symptoms and   He said there is no reason to suffer like I was suffering and took me off anti-depressent (prozac at the time) and prescribed the .5 Klonopin. That man saved my life.  Now_ I have never even thought to abuse Klonopin as for me it is simply medicine.  Same with Oxycodone after 3 surgery's. It's medicine and you take it as directed and stop taking it when you don't need it.  For people like me the benefits far_ far outweigh any risk. The bottom line is that my panic attacks were so severe as to be dibilitating and this drug save me when I was 43 years old. I'm 65 now and still working a high-tech job effectively enough to receive accolades for my work as well as great performance reviews that result in bonuses and pay raises. I think there are many_ many people like me who use a low dose_ don't abuse it_ and reap great benefit from anxiety relief. Tell me it will give me Alzheimers in 10 years and I'll tell you it's been more than worth it for me.,M,,25  years.5 1X D,6/18/2016Email,Klonopin
3, 5, Anxiety and crazy amount of stress,Sleepy_ relaxed_ can get a little short tempered the day after and mildly down mood the next day,Stops obsessive worry and allows me to eat and relax when my anxiety is high.

4, 4, Atypical Trigeminal Neuropathy,Initial tired feeling but that subsided after a couple of weeks,I am taking this for a neuropathic condition - not sure if that's considered off-label use - but it seems to sometimes help with my pain.

I have also found that it does calm me down and I am able to take things a bit more in-stride.,M,59,4  months.5 4X D,5/20/2016Email,Klonopin
5, 5, OCD and panic disorder,Felt somewhat loopy the first few weeks of taking Klonopin. The loopy feeling went away as I got used to the medicine.,Klonopin helps my anxiety tremendously. I know a lot of people are scared of taking Klonopin because of the fear of getting addicted but as long as you take it the way you're supposed to and don't abuse it you will be okay. My racing thoughts are practically gone and I almost never have a panic attack now. I used to spend almost every waking moment living in fear to the point where I was terrified to get out of bed and now I'm a functional member of society. My anxiety used to torment my mind and I had no way to stop the obsessive thoughts but Klonopin has helped me enough that I can do all the things I never thought I would be able to do because I was too scared.,F,22,5  years1 mg,5/17/2016,Klonopin

8, 5, Insomnia,No side effects at all.  Just a wonderful nights sleep.,I originally took it for a few months for severe anxiety_ 1 mg every 6 hours (4 mg a day). I found it also made me sleepy.  After a few months_ under a doctors care_ I started to reduce my dosage.  I no longer take it for anxiety_ but now I take it about once a week or so for insomnia and it gives me a great nights sleep.  All I need now is .25 mg for sleep.  I am shocked to hear that people get addicted to this drug.  It was easy for me to dose down without issues.  I tried Xanax initially_ but that drug does not last long enough for me.,F,52,2  years.25 mg 1X W,4/20/2016,Klonopin

I was prescribed this along with another medication for acute dystonia. The efficacy of this drug was not discussed with me. Apparently around 15% effective in dystonia. I did NOT provide informed consent. The neurologist was in complete denial about the side effects and potential for tolerance withdrawal which is truly scandalous and I was therefore left on it for months longer. He then gave me a dangerous regime for withdrawal. Withdrawal was truly horrendous and 6 months on I am still suffering the withdrawal symptoms of low mood_ insomnia_ anger_ tearfulness_ pins and needles_ fasiculations_ muscle twitching and vibrating sensations in my legs. So devastated I took this drug. It also increases your risk of developing dementia. BAD BAD BAD.,F,,10  months0.5mcg 2X D,3/28/2016,Klonopin

16, 4, Neck Tremor-Dystonia,I use it for my neck tremors and anxiety. I'm now able to be in public and not feel embarrassed anymore. It doesn't work 100% for me so I may in time increase my dose at some point. If I go without it for a few days to give my body a break it makes me feel off balanced_ like walking on a boat with a heavy spacy head and mild anxiety_ so it can be annoying If you choose to do that. Once I take it again I'm totally fine again.,If I decide to get off it I would defiantly wean from it to limit the withdrawals I mentioned. It's not a scary drug at all from my experience so far. So if your Dr. suggest it I would try it because I was scared at first too_ but now I'm not at all and best of all it does help with my neck tremors and anxiety.,F,51,1  years1mg 2X D,2/25/2016,Klonopin
17, 1, Anxiety and Panic Attacks,Headache_ nausea_ rapid heartbeat_ nightmares_ insomnia.,I had my first panic attack at 19 and after a month of hell_ decided to see a psychiatrist who prescribed me Xanax. I took them when I felt a panic attack coming on and xanax stopped it right in its tracks. Eventually_ just the comfort of having the Xanax around stopped the panic attacks. I stopped fearing the fear and stopped seeing a therapist for awhile. Fast forward to the birth of my daughter - I started experiencing post partum anxiety ten times worse than the worst panic attack of my life 24/7. I went to the ER several times and the only thing they could find was slightly elevated blood pressure. Was referred to a psychiatrist who basically made Xanax out to be worse than heroin. Her alternative was Klonopin and over the course of the 5 days taking this stuff_ I'm surprised I didn't commit suicide. I contemplated it; that's how bad it made me feel. Maybe it just didn't agree with my body chemistry but wow_ in addition to the side effects above_ I lost almost all my baby weight from the nausea and lack of appetite. I did not sleep at all; I was sleeping better having a cup of chamomile tea before bed! So_ I looked up the psychiatrist I was seeing back in college and he was still practicing. I felt relief just walking into his office. Went home with my prescription for Xanax and I'm back to just knowing relief is there and how it can stop and prevent a panic attack is enough. I rarely have to use it and suffer absolutely no bizarre side effects. Maybe for mild general an,F,34,5  days,2/1/2016Email,Klonopin
18, 5, Anxiety_ Panic Attacks,,No other drug works for me. I was prescribed this over 10 years ago. I had such bad anxiety and panic attacks I ended up in the hospital 3 times. I was prescribed this and My panic attacks and anxiety were mostly under control. I do not have any sode effects. I am not tired anymore than a normal person_ don't get dizzy or anything else. I have tried to come off of it multiple times because my parents thought it was bad for me to be on for a long time. I had such bad anxiety/withdrawls that I had to go back on it everytime.

22, 2, Restless Leg Syndrome_ Insomnia,Fatigue_ joints pain (elbows_ knees)_ light sleep_ withdrawal symptoms (anxiety_ memory loss),I was prescribed this because of leg movements during the night which could have been the cause of my fragmented sleep and lack of REM sleep. Even at the lowest dose it didn't work_ deep sleep and REM sleep became scarcer. The pain in my knee was severe and caused many sleepless nights. And like with all benzodiazepines quitting proved difficult_ because of the increased anxiety and the memory loss. The only positive thing about this drug is that it helps with social anxiety. During the time I was on it I was much more open and talkative. But the side effects are not worth it imo. I also discovered that taking this drug with (lemon) verbena herbal tea increased its effects.,M,42,6  months0.3 MG 1X D,11/27/2015EmailHistory,Klonopin

26, 2, Anxiety,Brain fog_ drowsiness_ pancreatitis_ dizziness,I have a rare pancreatic/biliary disorder that causes nausea and vomiting. Klonopin helped treat these symptoms plus the overwhelming anxiety that accompany my condition. Problem is when I wanted to go off it I entered a living nightmare. I did a very slow taper over 9 months. By the 6 month mark I started getting pancreatic attacks. I figured it was part of my condition_ but noticed the attacks worsened on days I lowered my dose. I went off Klonopin entirely and was dizzy for a month. It felt like I was on a boat. I'd get nausea_ panic attacks_ and the pancreatic pain was beyond what pain medication could touch. I cannot believe this medication caused such bad withdrawal and for so long! I will never take a benzo again.,F,46,3  years.25 mg 2X D,10/9/2015Email,Klonopin

It does help anxiety a little bit but the side effects are horrible. I discourage anyone to take this medication. I pray that my fiance wakes up and switches to something else because he will not listen to me. Other people have told him the same thing and have warned him about the way he acts on it but he doesn't listen.

The symptoms are horrendous and its very addicting and nearly impossible to get off of. The symptoms of rebound and withdrawal are almost unbearable. This drug caused my depression to increase to the point in which I was suicidal and it created extreme anxiety on the rebound. When the dose wears off Your original symptoms return ten fold. I strongly urge anyone to avoid this type of drug . Avoid caffeine on this med and when tapering off. I have been off clonazepam for four months after so called short term and still going through horrific nightmares and other symptoms of dementia. I truly believe this drug has changed the physiology of My brain. My memory is really bad and I feel so tired all the time as I can no longer reach deep sleep stages. I wake tired and very soar and unrested. Avoid this and other benzodiazepines at all cost. Both My Doctor and pharmacist were inept regarding this drug. They told Me to just taking it and I did.

On it for 9 years and my primary care doc kept writing scripts instead of talking to me and seeing if I really needed this addicting drug for so long.,Don't take it! I tried to cold turkey it last July. Big mistake! Ended up in the ER twice. They thought I was showing signs of ms and did a brain MRI on me. I don't have ms. It was all horrible withdrawl symptons! I went back on but have been slowly weaning since then. Every time I wean I have withdrawl of course not as severe as cold turkey but it's terrible. I hope to be free of this drug by this July a year after ending up in the ER. I want the old me back!,F,51,9  years0.5 mg 4x,4/8/2015,Klonopin
53, 1, Anxiety,Glassy eyed_ tired_ lethargic_ headache,I was on Klonopin six years ago for a couple of months and then crossed over to Valium and tapered for a month. I had severe muscle aches_ chemical anxiety_ and insomnia (3-4 hours of sleep a night). This went on for a few months but things improved each week and I healed.Stupid me went on Klonopin again in Nov 2013. I was on it for four months. Crossed over to Valium and did a six week taper. I am one year off and still suffering terribly!!!I have total insomnia for a year now (no sleep-zero for days at a time unless I take Benadryl to get a few hours)_ severe emotional blunting: can't cry or feel love for my children_ muscle twitching_ head pressure_ and burning skin. This withdrawal has rendered me almost non functional.Benzos are poison!!! Never ever take them. If you need something for anxiety_ try Valerian root. If you need a prescription_ try Vistaril. But never use benzos. This has destroyed my life and my family.,F,48,4  months.75 mg,4/8/2015,Klonopin

55, 5, insomnia and fibromyalgia,No side effects except the benefits of the drug seemed to be somewhat fluctuating from nite to nite after many years and I had no desire to increase the dosage.,I slowly tapered off of my 2 mg dosage; it took 1-1/2 months of a wide variety of awful_ awful side effects. But I am strong enough that I persevered and I got completely off (everybody is different). Once I was completely off (for 2 months)_ my insomnia and fibromyalgia pain returned with a vengeance. I felt I was slowly dying from sleep deprivation_ and I'm sure that I was. I could not rely on soma (which doesn't do much if taken daily) and other weaker sleep medications. It was soon clear that I had to go back on Klonopin and take it until my dying day. Klonopin is literally a life saver for me!,F,65, 2 mg 1X D,3/30/2015EmailHistory,Klonopin

60, 5, GAD/Sleep/Panic Disorder,Really good_ definitely takes the edge off. No tolerance after 6 months of once-weekly use. Really a lifesaver when needed_ highly recommended.,Only the Teva brand pill works for me. Tried others (Mylan_ Actavis_ Teva Orally disintegrating) to no avail. Taking two 0.5mg is more effective than one 1mg pill.  Always take on an empty stomach_ 30-90 minutes to start working. Sometimes it hits hard_ sometimes just enough to relax the muscles. Definitely a safe benzo if used responsibly_ if your doctor refuses to prescribe (especially without a history of drug addiction) then find a new doctor!,,,6  months1mg 1X AN,1/24/2015Email,Klonopin

I had terrible heart palipatations  _ anxiety_ woke up every 2 hours so I had extreme insomnia_ tremors_ night sweats_ nausea_ lack of appetite. Terrible taper and withdrawl just after 3 weeks.,This drug is the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life. I didn't even ask for it. A new Dr I went to thought I needed to take it for sleep and anxiety. I was there for a breast lump and just had resigned from a stressful job of course I had some anxiety. It have me anxiety. It should never be taken daily. It should only be given to severe epileptic patients. This drug costs me several months of absolute hell. I had such severe side effects and withdrawls I looked into a treatment center but of course they give you more drugs. I toughed it out and it was awful. Please do not take this drug!!!! I literally was not eating and functioning well for several months. It also threw my whole body in a crisis so now I have low thyroid.

62, 1, Social anxiety,Okay_ I won't bother with the lectures_ telling people not to take this because you will probably disregard it. That's what I did. Anyway_ when I started college I was nervous and went to my psych for something to help. She prescribed this. Over the 2.5 years I took this_ I experienced panic attacks_ psychosis_ withdrawal_ the list goes on. I have a very hazy memory of that time_ but this med completely made me lose my mind. I did things that weren't characteristic of me. I felt awful. I ended up in several psych wards (I don't have a psych history) from what I now understand to be from the side effects caused by this.,When I finally got myself off this_ it took months to feel normal. I had to taper the dose which was extremely unpleasant. Also_ many doctors as well as my psych didn't believe me. Long story short- I still have anxiety as that's who I am but I've realized that diet and exercise play a big part. Take care of yourself.  Visit benzo dot org dot uk for more info.

""my filter is broke"" I'm more outgoing_ talkative. . . have to watch what I say.",It would be difficult for me to overstate how beneficial this drug has been to me. Prior to adding Klonopin to my regimen (diagnosed BP as well) my anxiety was so severe as to affect every aspect of my life. Socially_ I was a recluse. I had to psyche myself up prior to going into social settings. At times even trips to the grocery store were difficult. At work I had a phobia when it came to using the phone (abhorred conference calls_ etc). Overall_ there was this constant_ pervasive fear that I had never been able to shake (been that way since I was a child). After Klonopin. . . .everything changed. Like a switch_ life isnt as hard anymore. I dont think twice about picking up the phone at work_ after my sons basketball team wins a game I eagerly run down from the stands to chat with the other parents. Its very worrisome to read the many horror stories of people who have or are trying to wean themselves off the medicine and the horrible side effects that they are dealing with but then there are the success stories. Individuals who've been on the medicine 5_10+ years and have complain of no side effects. As for me_ I'll continue taking the medicine. I take a .25mg to .5mg per day. I try to take a day off here or there in hopes that I can slow the speed at which I grow tolerate to the medicine. As I read the stories about the horrific withdrawal symptoms others are battling with I cant help but wonder. .  . what prompted them to want to wean themselves off the medicine in the fi,M,42,2  months.25mg 2X D,11/27/2014Email,Klonopin

67, 5, Anxiety/Panic Disorders,I don't recall any side effects.,I have GAD & PTSD. I withdrew from every1_ but my husband & sons. I never left the apartment unless I absolutely had to. I found out about Klonopin from my husband's doctor. I called my doctor..he was hesitant at first_ but knew I was grasping for hope. He had me try just about every antidepressant on the market.They all made me have nonstop anxiety attacks_ made me severely depressed & I stayed nauseous & sick_ so he put me on 6 MG Klonopin... 2 MG 3 times a day. I took that dosage for many years then I had to change doctors due to insurance. My new doctor changed the dose to 1 MG 3 times a day. That was 3 yrs ago. This passed September I was put on a new antidepressant. I went to get my Klonopin refilled but my doctor said no. After 3 wks I started having the episodes again and I have withdrawn from every1 again. I've had no meds of any kind for almost 2 months... I live in darkness again & it's like hell on earth. I don't know if I'm addicted to Klonopin cause the only thing I'm experiencing is what I started feeling when I was 15_ & had never taken medicine of any kind before.. I didn't actually start meds until I was 28. Nothing ever worked except Klonopin. I know Klonopin won't work for everyone but it worked for me.,F,40,10  years3 MG,11/19/2014Email,Klonopin
68, 1, insomnia_ anxiety and panic attacks,Headache_ nausea_ insomnia_ stomach pain_ RLS_ no appetite_ irregular heart beat_ severe depression_ suicidal thoughts_ blood pressure problems  etc_ etc_ etc Terrible withdrawal!,This medication will make almost anyone feel great for a short time. The problem is when you HAVE to or WANT to stop. It is a terrible withdrawal to deal with. I strongly recommend NOT starting this medication unless you understand you will probably have to increase your dosage eventually/quickly to achieve the effect it is prescribed for and eventually you will have to stop taking it. Withdrawal is Hell and strongly outweighs any good this medication did for me in the beginning. It will take me months to slowly taper off and my head may never be the same again.

69, 1, Epilepsy,Before tolerance withdrawal_ I'm sure I had side effects but I was too much of an idiot to notice. Basically_ it changed my moods_ personality_ and put me in to a fog for 1.5 years until I learned about tolerance withdrawal. Learned that from the ER Drs_ not my own Dr.,Been tapering for a year and 3months. From 2mg_ 2x day - now down to .25mg_ 1x day. If I had read all the negative reviews about this before or while I was taking it the first year_ I would have thought_ Oh Blahhh_ no biggie...works for me!That's the problem. It works for just about everyone. So for all those that give it a 4 or 5_ because it works for you...you're not unique to it working for you.  The negative reviews_ the warnings_ the horror stories are all completely true and they are not just written by people who have nothing better to do. These are warnings. I've tapered very slowly. The first few drops were rocky but not horrific because I did it very slow. My taper from .5mg to .25 has been like being dunked into my own unpredictable personal hell at any moment or day_ without notice and then back to reality for a bit.  If the bad reviews sound emotional_ its more fact. Especially since it doesn't just effect emotions or mental state. It's completely physical as well. Your entire body is effected. Right.  I didn't believe all of it either. Except today as I was doing nothing else but sitting on the couch with my dog_ part of my tooth fell out of my mouth. No cavities. The nerves had died. Klonopin depletes minerals_ vitamins and kills your nervous system. It was NOT intended for long term use!Good luck to all of you who are coming off of this poison and to those of you that have yet to begin the journey.,F,40,2.5  years.25 1X D,11/7/2014Email,Klonopin

They cause a part of the brain known as GABA receptors to become down-regulated and cause one of the longest_ most intense_ withdrawal of any drug known to man.

101, 1, For anxiety,I began Klonopin '09. I then began to have tinnitus_ feel weak & sick & sinus headaches. I went to doctors & they couldn't find anything wrong. I didn't understand. I began to want to just stay home. I lost interest in life - only did what was necessary_ for my kids. But_ I didn't do fun things with them. Fun became foreign to me. I had become a recluse_ that could hardly smile_ I had to force it. I took Klonopin as needed every few weeks_ then every few days_ & just .5 mg. It didn't occur to me that this was causing my symptoms. Until 2013_ I found info about Klonopin & it's side effects. I read that you shouldn't just stop it_ so I asked to be weaned off. My shrink said to take half a pill for the next few weeks. I did_ & within 1 week I was in the ER. I was hyperventilating_shaking_ nauseous_ & had the worst anxiety I have ever had. I was told it was withdrawals! My PCP reinstated me on .5 mg. But now_ to stop the shaking & panic attacks_ I have to take it daily! My shrink didn't think it possible to have  withdrawals from a low dose. It happened to me. I'm in the early stages of tapering again_ by .125 mg. I hope_ I won't go through the withdrawals again. I'm okay_ just very weak_ sickly_ sinus headaches & I'm anxious - that's tolerable. I look forward to getting off of this crap. It is not worth it! It's not intended to be taken for more than 2 weeks. I was on it for 4 years! How could this happen? I trust doctors to know what's best.,,F,39,4  years.5 mg,2/2/2014,Klonopin

104, 3, Insomnia,At 1mg_ very hungover the next morning.  Hard to get up and to work on time.  At .5 and .25mg that was less of a problem but drug didn't work as well for insomnia.,Started at 1mg per night due to severe insomnia.  It was at a stressful time of life and I also had daily headaches_ abdominal pain and a prostate infection.  At 1mg it did help me to get 4-6 hours of sleep but never a full night sleep.  The next day I would feel very hungover and struggled getting to work on time.  Once up and around it got better.  However_ after 3 weeks on 1mg_ I tapered to .5mg for two weeks_ then .25 mg for 1 week_ then quit taking it due to withdrawal concerns.  Withdrawal has been a challenge even at this lower dose for a short period of time.  Rebound insomnia occurred at each taper and sporadically... and now that I have been off completely for a few days I'm only getting 3-4 hours of sleep per night.  I hope this will pass with time.  The drug didn't cause any crazy symptoms for me like some other posts... but did totally snow me on 1mg and was only partially helpful for sleep.  But I must say that my sleep problems were so bad at the time that I would have probably lost my job if I had not started the medicine.

107, 1, Insomnia_ Chronic Pain,This drug is pure poison. I wish I had read this page before I began taking it. While it worked well initially_ I never even thought that my side effects were coming from this medication. I have no idea why I did not research it as I have done my other medications. Memory loss was the first sign something was wrong. I was tongue tied all the time and conversations were awkward because I forgot the word I was trying to say and my brain worked faster than my mouth but I still got stuck on common words that I could not remember. Forgetfulness was terrible. I could not remember where I put anything. SEVERE procrastination_ I did not care if anything got finished or not.

Insomnia_ fatigue_ emotional numbness_ headaches_ heart palpitations_  weight gain_ no motivation and procrastination. I w,"My life stopped when I began taking this drug. It was not obvious at the beginning but as  time went by it became obvious to everyone that something was wrong with me. This drug damages your bran and I think it is irreversible. It took me 8 months to get off of this POISON and things have not returned to normal. I am no longer the person I was before taking this drug. This drug took ""me"" away and all that was left was the shell of the person I used to be. I ruined every single relationship I had_ my family_ my friends and loved ones could not tolerate my highs and lows. Especially when I promised to do something and then had no idea why they were mad at me and they did not believe that I had no memory of that discussion. Then my moods swings were so bad that I scared people_ especially when I became angry. Benzos change the receptors in your brain and you are no longer the same and never will be. This drug should be taken off the market. I have never had problems getting off of medication but this one put me on my ass. I was so suicidal that I knew I would kill myself_ it was just a matter of time. I did not know who I was anymore and I did not like who I became. I had to be hospitalized to finally detox off this medication and then it became a mental health issue. After I got off this medication my memory loss did not return to normal.

108, 4, chronic anxiety/for sleep,no adverse side effects,Klonopin is a popular and interesting drug.  Doctors prefer it over other_ more quick-release benzos in particular because it lasts longer_ and therefore_ one would think it to be less addictive.  Maybe so_ maybe no_ but the body and mind habituate to it in no time.  I was always on a rather hefty dose of Klonopin for a long time.  Anywhere between 6-11 mg a day in fact.  At first_ even for the first several years_ it did the trick for insomnia and generalized anxiety_ but after 7-8 years_ even 6+ mg began to render itself ineffective.  Primarily_ the problem with Klonopin contrasted with other benzos is that while it lasts the longest (12 hours)_ it takes a full hour_ that is_ 60 whole minutes before one begins to feel its effects.  For someone with panic disorders and poly-anxiety disorders_ like myself_ this simply doesn't cut the mustard.  If one has panic attacks in particular_ along with chronic anxiety_ I highly recommend Xanax_ Xanax XR_ or Valium over Klonopin.  But it did the trick longer than any of those others for me so far_ so I did give it a 4 out of 5.,M,28,8  years2 mg 3X D,12/27/2013,Klonopin

114, 1, Insomnia,While taking the 2mg dosage at night I did not think I had many bad side effects but then went to 5mg and this medicine almost killed me  I discovered that this medication caused severe memory loss - I would do things and have absolutely no memory of doing it_ severe cognitive impairment_ irrational thought and actions_ confusion_ heart palpitations_ severe mood changes - the time I was on it have been a blur. I have been suicidal with irrational thoughts and actions. Very sudden changes in my mood and behavior. I would be fine one minute and throwing a temper tantrum the next. The worst part is not remembering things that I said or did. I wrote letter that I do not remember writing_ talked to people and later had no memory of even seeing that person or what I said. I had no impulse control and from what my family has told me I acted like a crazy lunatic. I lost friendships and my own son will not let me see my grandchildren because I have acted so irrational. I was a different person,Getting off this medication was pure hell_ I literally thought I was losing my mind. I had terrible mood swings_ headaches_ and felt at times that I was unable to sit still. I had to have something moving at all times. I had to tap my foot or swing my arms. It was like I had ants in my pants_ that creepy crawly feeling all the time. I think I was more irrational trying to get off this medication that I was while on it full strength. Please if you are considering taking this medication_ check out the side effects and read the hell that some of the people on this site have been through. My advice is to never take this medication unless you want to ruin every single thing in your life. I have relationships that can't be fixed_ I lost everything I loved_ my marriage_ my son and grandson_ my job_ friendships and all self-respect that I ever had for myself. I almost killed myself on several occasions. The temptation to kill myself was so great that I had myself committed which  was the worst thing I could have done. Three days in hell and I would not wish anyone to go through what they put me through in the psyc ward. It took 6 months to finally come off of this medication completely. I have been off of it for 3 months now but the damage to my family and everyone I loved has not been not been repaired. I do not know if my son will ever let me see my grandson again.

116, 1, as a tapering method after Ativan,IT'S BEEN A LIVING HELL. I'm on a slow taper (was originally on Ativan_ but have switched to liquid K to taper because of K's longer half-life). Was originally prescribed Ativan for anxiety after an emergency medical situation and subsequent PTSD. No doctor ever explained the problems associated with benzo pills. I didn't take it every day_ so I naively thought I wouldn't be hooked. And I believed in my doctors. One day while out walking_ I felt like I was having a stroke. I was extremely dizzy_ couldn't walk straight_ and had to hold onto something for awhile. After it happened again_ I realized I was addicted after searching online. My doctor refused to help me taper and instead told me that I needed to see a psychiatrist and be on Paxil.

I was on this garbage for over 31 years and still now going through a horrible withdrawal all alone from the effect that the side effects had on me.  Nobody can expect a spouse to stay with someone who becomes so sick they can't look after themselves.  I nearly died from the side effects.  Was dx with every syndrome under the sun.  All a bunch of garbage.  Down as low as I am now all these sxs lumped into syndromes are completely gone except for feeling extremely exhausted from the two plus years I've spent withdrawing.  Everyone I knew wants nothing to do with me now even tho I'm a different person completely.  I don't blame them.  The withdrawal itself is horrific and the memories of what these did to me haunt me everyday.  I literally have no one left in my life_ even my children.  I spend my days using coping techniques to get throught the withdrawal.  That's EVERY day!  (with 2 more years to go).  My nights are fraught with sleeplessness from withdrawal that no one seems to want to admit exists.  Hence now the physical health is being affected tho not nearly as bad as when I was on the full 12 mg.

147, 2, Anxiety,I wanted a longer acting anxiety medication & since this has 36 hr half life thought I would try it. First night I took the 1/2 mg & had some pretty disturbing dreams & very real feeling. Each time I'd wake up from them so sleep was interrupted all night. I also didn't feel right on it so second night went with 1/4 mg & more dreams plus sweats & felt awful all night. It's a very strong medication & I'm sensitive to meds so that could be why. Lorazepam is much more mild but short acting. Not sure how people take higher doses if klonopin & function. Anyway_ maybe after a time dreams & side effects would go away but not going to try. I can imagine it would be a nightmare to get off this stuff. Good luck,,F,60,2  days.05,4/12/2013,Klonopin

153, 1, Anxiety,This drug is evil incarnate.  It utterly destroyed my life.  I was in a wasteland for years before figuring out it was this horror drug.  I have been housebound for 4.5 years after a too quick taper and c/t from .3mg.  I was bedridden for six months and mostly bedridden for three years after that.  I had up to 40 w/d symps that tried to kill me.  I sustained systemic functional brain damage and CNS damage and have been living in the seven circles of Hades.  NEVER take this poison.  It's illegal to take for more than a month in other countries.  It's 20x more powerful and destructive than Valium...and that created a nightmare in the 60's.  Got anxiety?

155, 1, To counteract agitation from antide,Extreme depression and lethargy_ suicidal thoughts and urges_ derealization_ depersonalization_ rage,Within an hour or less of taking this drug I would get extremely depressed and lethargic to the point my husband had to help feed and bathe me. I started having rages FOR NO REASON out of nowhere and then suicidal thoughts and even urges_ again for no reason.This drug as well as others in its class (benzodiazepines) should be limited to short-term (2-4 week) use. Beyond that_ the user could develop a tolerance where more of the drug is needed to reduce anxiety/insomnia. Users also get interdose withdrawal from the drug and feel the need to take more of the drug before the next dose to calm down. Before you know it_ your brain is dependent on it. Withdrawals from this drug are Hellish and last longer (YEARS in some cases) than withdrawal than from street drugs. Cold turkey withdrawal from this drug made all the above side effects much worse and I'm still healing from its effects 18 months later.,F,36,10  weeks0.125 3X D,4/8/2013,Klonopin

172, 4, GAD,None,I see people here taking 4 mg for sleep.  4 mg is equal to 80 mg Valium which would knock out a horse.  Get by on the absolute lowest dose that takes care of your symptoms.  benzo.org.uk has strategies to taper if/when needed.  Many people can taper with few problems.  But many go through a living hell to get off of it.  If someone is considering a benzo and reading this_ exhaust other options first but if you need it_ it can be a wonder drug.  One mg seems such a low dose_ it isn't.  It's equal to 20 mg Diazepine.  I've been on psych meds for 30 years and I do a lot of research.  Sometimes I roll the dice and K has worked well.  But know what you're getting into when your doc casually says benzo.  Your doctor likely has never withdrawn from it or taken it and they can be quite casual when prescribing.

199, 4, Anxiety and to stay asleep,Tired_ mild depression the next day sometimes,I was originally prescribed 30 Klonopin in 2006 while starting an SSRI because I could not get a decent nights sleep.  I only took about half of them and then switched to Tylenol PM.  I was prescribed them again in 2009 when my Grandmother passed away because of bad anxiety.  My general practitioner will not prescribe these because of addiction potential.  I recently received another prescription for 30 and have been breaking them apart as needed as I am going through a lot of stress.  I try to only taken them as a last resort when I can't calm my nerves down from praying or exercise.  I would suggest only taking them as needed if you can get relief from an SSRI.  I think they are very effective but have abuse potential.  It takes about an hour to work so I usually take it when I'm really stressed at night shortly before bed.,F,33,6  years.25 1X AN,5/25/2012Email,Klonopin

201, 4, Anxiety attacks,Relaxation_ sometimes drowsiness. They are intensified when mixed with alcohol.,I've been prescribed Klonopin for a year and a half. To me and many others_ Klonopin takes about an hour to kick in after you take it. So it won't stop an anxiety or panic attack dead in its tracks. However_ if you have random anxiety or panic attacks throughout the day_ take one of these and in an hour or so_ you'll be calm for the rest of the day. It has a long half-life_ meaning that its effects last about six hours compared to Xanax lasting about three. Do not take this every day unless you want to have seizures trying to get off of it. You will unknowingly become addicted. Even if your doctor says to take it daily_ educate yourself. If you take this with alcohol_ do not drive.,M,22,1.5  years0.5mg 1X AN,5/13/2012,Klonopin

Never again.  It makes you suicidally depressed and you can't even have one drink without turning into a psycho. No thanks.,F,26,2  weeks 1X D,12/10/2011,Klonopin
243, 4, Anxiety_ insomnia_ panic attacks,Sedation (but sometimes that's a good thing),I am well aware that this is an addictive drug. I used to want to stop taking it. I have flushed entire bottles down the toilet because I was so scared I was dependent on it and did not want to be. Everytime I did that I had rebound anxiety so bad that I wanted to die. Once I ended up in the psychiatric hospital after one of these episodes (but I was also going through an extremely difficult marriage problem). However_ at this point I don't care if I have to take it for the rest of my life. Severe anxiety is a miserable experience_ as is chronic insomnia. Klonopin helps with both of these. It doesn't make me groggy in the morning_ it doesn't cause weight gain...it doesn't seem to have many downfalls while on it_ but stopping it is no picnic - that's putting it lightly.,F,34,2  years1mg 2X D,12/9/2011,Klonopin
244, 5, OCD intrusive thoughts_ gad,I'm in the uk and it's called clonazepam here. Was prescribed by a psychartrist as it's not a typical benzo a gp would prescribe. had a breakdown in feb after discontinuing Prozac after 4 years ( cold turkey)_ in the midst of withdrawal I thought I was losing my mind and nothing would calm me down least of all the 2mg of diazepam they gave me. the psychatrist was part of the crisis team and ordered me to take 0.5 three times daily as it would build up better in my bloodstream. The relief was unbelievable...I remember lying in bed crying and thinking life was over and within 30 minutes of taking it I was saying I could take my girls to their ballet class!I've cut down and then gone back up as i've had lots of ssri changes this year. now take 0.5 x2 and keeps me calm. Side effects: headache_ slightly euphoric feeling_ memory not great. Worth it though.

252, 3, muscle relaxant_ anxiety reduction,I was on this drug for sleep .25 at bedtime along with 300 mg Neurontin. Then_ started taking 4-5 times per day (.25 each time) for chronic muscle spasm/pain which helped. It does work great for anxiety and is the only muscle relaxant that works for me. However_ after a few months you get tolerant and then need a boost to get any benefits_ yet are stuck with the side effects: daytime drowsiness that can make driving dangerous_ memory and cognitive impairment. As others have said_ it is hell to get off. You need to paper gradually over a period of months and then may suffer for another 6 months or more with insomnia_ restless legs like symtoms_ etc.,Take this only for 1-2 weeks at a time for a stressful period or 1-2 times per week on an ongoing basis.

I lasted nearly six weeks this time_ the longest ever. I became so exhausted and psychotic I had to go to the ER. My primary care BEGGED my shrink to put me back on. I've been on the crap (1 mg per day) for nearly 20 years). and his six-week taper seemed to be going fine_ until it ended. I fell apart_ and the sensations were (and still are) a living hell. Imagine being able to see through your eyelids. Imagine waking seizures. One night I was nearly asleep and I saw a light through the window and actually SAW a UFO and aliens outside. It was actually just a motion-detector light over the shed. I'm marginally better back on the stuff_ but hate myself for not being able to be off it. Add to this the fact that when I was hospitalized right after the taper-down (for psychoses)_ it was discovered I had head lice! Now I am constantly in fear that they will come back_ and can't stop itching. Constant checks by my husband come up clean_ but I don't think I'll every get over the phobia.

This is how people get hooked on taking it every day. It's great to have something like this during those unbearable anxious moments_ but it is very wise to take an antidepressant that keeps your general anxiety at bay. Once you find one that works for you (mine is Celexa)_ your anxiety overall goes down_ and you learn how to recognize and better deal with anxious situations. Of course_ Klonopin is there if the anxiety is out-of-this-world_ but that seldom happens now.Also..I wonder why there are 4 ratings on October 29 that all give Klonopin a ""1"" rating.

If you wan't to feel utterly and completely out of your mind from uncontrollable mind and bofy impulses that never stop_ only subsife snf lose control of every part of your mind and bofy then go on this drug and then go off it. It has no mental benefits but temporarily slowing down anxiety caused by other meds_ and muscle spasms thst are severe. But 2 months eithout it I slept a total of 3 days.

259, 1, anxiety brought on by ativan wd,For about 2 weeks it helped the anxiety problems I was having.  Soon after all the symptoms got worse and more frequent.  the doctor I was seeing told me it was withdrawal and to take more.  At that time I didn't know about the addictive nature of these drugs but I still didn't want to take more.  I continued to have worse and worse symptoms.  I never had any of these symptoms before I was given ativan for labrynthitis_ which it was later found I never had.  I was given a multitude of drugs to try that hard horrible side effects.  My pch doc thought my symptoms were more biologic and sent me for more tests_ hormones_ thyroid_ vitamin levels.  All came back normal.  He sort of had the right idea_ but was certainly down the wrong road. It wasn't until after many more tests and a new doctor and my own research that it was determined that the K was causing all my problems.,While many people can stop taking these meds with few problems_ there are still many that have severe withdrawal effects.  I am one of these people. Even the psyc doc finally admitted to me that there are some that have real problems discontinuing these drugs.  My new doc crossed me over to valium and I tapered from that.  I am almost 5 months away from benzos and still suffering with symptoms daily.NEVER TAKE A BENZO,F,61,2  years.25 2X D,10/29/2011,Klonopin

If you do_ beware interdose withdrawal_ tolerance and withdrawal from this medication.  Do not take for more than 2 weeks.  Do not cold-turkey.  You must taper slowly off this.

265, 2, Depression_ Anxiety_ Social Phobias,I've been taking this drug for the past two years. IT IS NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION. Save yourself a trip to hell_ if you're even lucky to come back. For the first few weeks_ it was a life-saver. I thought I had found a freaking miracle. Your body builds a tolerance over time (I ALWAYS took it as prescribed) and needs more of the drug to feel the same effect as in the beginning. I've never been one to have panic attacks_ and while this drug is often prescribed for them_ I didn't start to get them until I was on it. I had short/long term memory loss_ felt like a zombie_ hit my ex boyfriend (I'm NOT a violent person)_ was depressed_ isolated myself_ became emotionally numb_ ended up in a psychiatric ward twice_ tried to kill myself once which resulted in a regular hospitalization for a few days_ and overall it has changed my personality. Do NOT go on this drug unless you have NO other choice. I cannot stress this enough. I hated what I became_ therefore I quit cold turkey. It was two weeks,Finally at the end of two weeks of abruptly stopping it_ I felt so terrible that I caved and took it. I'm now in the process of tapering down (you have to) and even that sucks. There's still withdrawal symptoms such as headaches_ extreme forgetfulness_ irrational_ to name a few. Although I am starting to feel like my old self_ but I WISH I had NEVER EVER started this medication. It quickly turns on you and becomes the CAUSE of your problems_ NOT THE SOLUTION.

I gained 50 pounds have no get up and go_ I basically hit a brick wall no ambition_ sleep all the time_ severe brain fog and memory loss.  After losing my job due to missing so many days because of fatigue ( I have a bachelors degree in Health Administration and my MBA) I decided with my doctors advice to go off this terrible drug.  Yes_ it relieved my panic condition but the weight gain_ fatigue and brain fog was not worth it anymore. Take advice from someone who has been on it forever_ its a horrible drug_ you don't even realize it until you lose a job to it like I did. I am now at the phase of weaning where I don't take any at all_ it's been Hell on Earth_ you don't know how many times I wanted to call 911 because the withdrawals are so horrible.  I am typing this because I never realized how addictive this medication was until I asked to go off it_ I am going through a withdrawal nightmare!!

287, 1, Anxiety,You can play Russian roulette with this drug if you want to. Everything got worse on this drug. The problem is you do not know it. The fog in brain is this bad. Maybe if you read enough you will see the evil that it is. Libido problems_ brain was foggy _ Memory Loss and on and on...,I have been tapering off of this and other benzos for 2.5 years! It creates such a fog over your mind that most do not see the problem for what it is. You can take it your whole life or get off of it with an appropriate taper plan. I have the physical stamina of a 100 year old man. If you are thinking about taking this drug_ don't.

288, 1, Insomnia,Pretty much all the one's you can read in any pharmacology book and article related to Clonazepam. I was prescribed this medication as needed when having difficulty falling asleep. Then one day my wife took .05 after she ran out of her nausea medication. She was 17 weeks pregnant at that time and still experiencing severe nausea and still loosing weight. Her medication barely helped and it was the strongest anti-nausea medication in the market. She ran out of her medication and then was given the wrong refill. She was not feeling well and had problems sleeping. She took .05 and felt well and the nausea stopped and could be in the kitchen and tolerate food smell again. She was happy she cooked herself eggs! Well the next day she took 1mg then did not realize she was not acting well. She took another 2mgs. Then lost count! She woke up at 3:00am angry_ hostile_ threatening_ suicidal and confused. She then attempted suicide by taking at least 8 tabs. of 2 mgs each! She reacted to them and,Take Clonazepma is good for a very short term maybe a week but too risky for the long run. I have known addicts who have presented drastic mood changes and personality changes too. Becareful take only if you have to and have no other choice. I gave a low rating because of how it affected my wife. She has never been that way since then and has never reacted this psychotic. Pregnant_ hormones raging_ loosing weight due to poor nutrition_ becamed depressed plus this medication. It was not a good reaction!

Do NOT take this whenever you feel like it. Take it only when you feel like you'll have an anxiety attack without it. This is not a long-term medication.

294, 4, Insomnia,none,Klonopin has allowed me to sleep 6 full hours uninterrupted with out any side effects which I have not been able to do for atleast 6 months.  With the small dosage_ and little amount of time I have taken this drug_ I feel it has helped greatly with my insomnia problem.  Prior to taking the medication_ I was only sleeping 1-3 broken hours per night. My major concern_ however_ is a fear of addiction.  It seems to me that individuals who have been on Klonopin for a short period give it a highter rating than those folks who have been on it for extended periods of time.  Although I feel it works very well for me_ I certainly have a fear of addiction and rebound insomnia with longer lengths of use. I plan on cutting back to discontinue using this drug within the next week to avoid that problem.  I am hoping that this short amount of usage may possibly break the severe insomnia cycle so that Ambien_ or something less benign_ may be more effective..,F,55,6  days0.5 mg 1X D,3/28/2011,Klonopin

I have had WORSE anxiety since the drug_ insomnia_ back clenching_ heart palpitations_ brain zaps_ ear ringing_ irritable bowel syndrome_ etc.  Do not go on this drug for longer than 2 weeks.  Definitely don't take it_ it rewires your brain and makes you dependent very quickly.  You'll just need more and more and it has been proven to lead to brain atrophy.

Overall_ it has helped with those horrible anxiety attacks.  I take 1 mg prior to going to sleep.  The downside has been insomnia and dependence.  I experience more anxiety if I suddenly stop.  This drug is not effective in it's original dosage if I take it every day.  It doesn't work anymore_ so I stop taking it for about a week or two every month.  Other than that_ I would need to take double to get the same effect. It has it's good and bad sides_ but it has helped me out many times on the anxiety problems.

My doc and I talked about a switch cause lorazepam just wasn't cutting it in terms of anxiety down at work. I switched to klonipin and it's been fine. I no longer need propranolol cause the klonipin taken at night lasts throughout the next day. To all who push the panic button about addiction_ well_ think of your quality of life without it. I know I'm addicted to klonipin_ but the alternative is endless anxiety which started when I was around 9. I came to the realization that I have a very highly reactive nervous system and school and work was a nightmare to get though on a daily basis_ and on klonipin it isn't. It's a quality of life issue for me. I know and understand it is a drug_ it can be addictive_ but if it improves my quality of life immensely at work_ with family and in my relationship with friends and my girlfriend_ well - seems like a no brainer to me.

When having a rough busy or social day and can not cope_ when feeling the agitation build up...thats when I would take it.  I'd skip days_ because as it is long lasting I'd be fine into the next day sometimes.  So I think if you don't abuse the med you can gain something from taking klonopin.

329, 1, Anxiety,More side effects than you can count_ more than you can identify and more than you can remember.  There are side effects_ withdrawal symptoms_ and rebound effects that can seem so unrelated to the drug that you don't recognize them as caused by klonopin at first.  Once you have experienced any problems with Klonopin_ and it can happen fast_ you can never take this drug again.,Long lasting and extremely difficult withdrawal symptoms and rebound effects.  The suffering that klonopin causes is not worth any benefit you may receive.  Some doctors and pharmacists believe that this drug is not addictive.  That is far from the truth.  Klonopin is highly addictive and causes the most heinous withdrawals.  The very best that anyone can do is to not take Klonopin in the first place.  If you have a prescription_ don't fill it.  If you have klonopin_ throw it away unless you need to taper off_ then taper off and never take it again.,M,54,30  days.5 3X D,12/2/2010,Klonopin

332, 1, insomnia,i get adequate sleep and feel comfortable with this drug but the problem is i am dependent on the drug and doctor that prescibes it. after 18 years i feel a slave to this drug. my advise to anyone considering taking it_ dont. i have tried withdrawal from klonopin twice. it was a trip into hell. i lived in a world of hallucinations for 5-6 days and after that  the world was like running long fingernails on a chalk board.,the medical community is in about face concerning all controlled substance. their first concern is not the patient it is their practice. be prepared if you are a long term patient of this drug_to one day ask for your refill and be told it is no longer prescibed theraputically. i really dont want to attempt to go down that road of withdrawal again but i really have no choice. i am a older man that has been told he has hidden heart problems.  i dont even know if i will survive the immediate withdrawal_ but its worth the risk to be rid of this monster. gradual reduction in dosage does not work and just delays your entry into hell. i am bi-polar with a strong tendancy toward mania. my mind operates high speed internet with multiple windows open at all times. i used the drug to reboot. i have already given up the psychotropic drugs that reduced me to a drone. i want to be rid of klonopin slavery. recovery is said to take as long as a year for a long term user. i feel like i am headed into uncharted waters of danger_ and yes_ i am terrified as hell. if you are one of the people that has abused this drug to bring you back down from your normal RECREATIONAL DRUG_ I wish i could grab your hand and pull you down into hell with me. this rampant abuse of the drug is what will lead to its sudden demise. i am now considered to be the same as you_ a habitual drug addict.,M,59,18  years 1X D,11/15/2010Email,Klonopin

Everyone eventually hits tolerance and of course the mg has to increase_ I refused!,I found out 1mg of klonopin is equal to 20mg of Valium 20! google it_ look it up!

337, 4, Anxiety,Some lack of motivation at times. Other times I have more motivation because anxiety is not as bad.,The only reason I gave this medication a 4 instead of a 5 is because I felt it stopped working after about a year to a year and a half. I believe it didn't work as well because I was drinking too much caffeine. When I tried to get off of it_ I was struck with bad depression and anxiety. I wont lie_ for some people_ it is hard to get off of. I took 0.5 mg less every month until I was down to nothing. It was still hard for me to get off of it. I am back on_ and feel how I felt before. I am careful with my caffeine intake now which helps fight off the anxiety.,M,34,2  years1.5 mg 2X D,11/8/2010,Klonopin
338, 1, Insomnia/PLMD,Best drug for PLMD...Worked great for sleep but side effects began to develop after about a year without realizing clonazepam was the cause. This drug (and all benzos) are terribly addictive and while a few people can stop the drug with little or no problem_ most cannot.,Reduced dosage from 1mg to .5mg after 1.5 years_ tapering over one month. Developed strange muscle and urinary problems_ not realizing the cause. After labs_ xrays and MRI_ doc eventually told me to stop the drug (.5mg) to see if the symptoms were side effects. He mentioned nothing about tapering or withdrawals and_ as I found out later_ it was because he DIDN'T KNOW about them! I'm now into my 6th month of being unable to work because my leg muscles are so painful and tight that it makes walking and sitting almost impossible. And my symptoms aren't nearly as bad as others. I'm filing for disability and now have a handicap placard for my car. Before stopping this drug_ please do your homework so that you can safely taper to reduce the degree of withdrawal symptoms. Better yet_ stay away from benzos altogether. American doctors believe they're safe. They're not.

I can sleep normally for months at a time (no prescription aids) but then something happens to retrigger my insomnia (usually in the Fall_ oddly enough) and I go back to this very low dose.  However_ I have discovered that when I begin using it I need a larger dose the first couple of nights (just to get a decent amount of the stuff into my system I suppose). Here is what has worked for me: 1st night -i mg.  2nd-3rd nights -.5 mg.

I have found no major side effects and can not believe some of the negative comments listed. I really trust this drug to help me calm down when I start having racing thoughts. Sometimes I start to worry about bills_ or work_ but as soon as I start feeling anxious I just take one pill(sometimes just half of one) and I will start to feel more calm but NOT sedated. I can still focus and this will last throught the remainder of the day. I do not recommend taking more than 4mg a day... I can see where people can start feeling numb or addicted. If you take the least amount possible it WILL work! I sleep better too. When I know I'm running low I start taking less as needed. When I run out I can wait till I go to the doctor. It's not a MUST have and I don't feel addicted. You have to be responsible with this drug. I'm suppose to take 2 a day but I don't. I just take as needed_ some times I only take half and some days I take 2_ some days I don't take any. I really feel Klonopin can help a lot of people if you take it properly.

Klonopin breaks down that wall_ allowing me to communicate with my fellow human beings.Unfortunately it has dulled my brain.  I experience almost no emotion in my life.  Some would say this is a good thing_ but I feel that emotions are an important part of the experience of life.  I find it disturbing to observe that I have felt no strong emotions about_ for instance_ the recent death of a close family member and the ending of a romantic relationship of several years.  I simply don't seem to care_ whereas before I would have been completely torn up over these losses.If I could go back_ I would not have taken it and would prefer to have experienced the emotions I should have felt_ along with the social anxiety.,M,28,1  years0.25 MG 2X D,9/8/2010,Klonopin

363, 4, anxiety/ depression,sleepiness in the beginning_ possible weight gain,I started taking this drug several years ago for isolated attacks of anxiety_ mostly in public places and due to my severe case of Crohn's Disease. During my hospital stays the doctors would put me on high doses of Adavan_ an anti-anxiety drug in its IV form. Withdrawing from that and the hardcore IV painkillers every time I got out was horrible for about a week. Weaning helped a lot! I find that I don't withdraw from the clonazapam as long as I  am careful with taking it. My doctor recently changed the dose to once/twice a day. Keeping the dose as low as possible is important. Also keeping in frequent contact with your doctor is important. I also take Zoloft and Welbutrin and clonazapam has added thee missing ingredient I need to not have mood swings and to feel able to function normally again. WARNING: Withdrawl and drug dependancy is a real thing and this drug can cause that. People who have reviewed it this way have gone through a horrible experience. Do not take more than as directed and talk to your doctor about any concerns you have. My psychiatrist is wonderful at helping me with all of my meds.,F,23,2  years.5 2X D,9/6/2010,Klonopin
364, 4, Anxiety,Initially made me tired/sleepy.,"In my experience_ this medication is safe and effective. Obviously_ there are a large number of very ill_ highly emotional people who use terms like_ ""Evil"" and ""Horrible"" to describe this medication. In general_ it is my finding that medications are neither evil or horrible_ but some can lend themselves to abuse. Klonopin_ like many other drugs_ can be abused.It is important that any person who NEEDS to take Klonopin do so under the care of professional_ and that the drug be used in moderation. Again_ in my limited experience_ it would appear to be safe_ although there are a number of people who have developed some degree of dependency (that's different than addiction_ though).Further_ I would characterize the comments of others--specifically those who suggest that people should NEVER take a drug--as irresponsible and uninformed. Any person who reviews information on this forum should remember that we humans are all different in the way in which we respond to medications and drugs. It's a really_ really bad idea to suggest that a medication is EVIL (or terrible_ etc.) based on anecdotal_ limited information.Long story short: Klonopin works. Don't take too much of it. Use it under the care of a physician. Try to learn as much as you can about why your body/mind seems to require it.",M,49,6  months0.5 2X D,9/3/2010,Klonopin

However I have never taken two in a day except when i have had a migraine.  I have tried so many migraine meds and none work.  I took the klonopin once when I had a migraine to possible knock myself out of my Missouri and hopefully wake up without the headache. I was surprised to find the headache went away and instead of going to sleep I went to the beach with friends...a little sluggish but it beat a migraine.  Other wise I only take it when I feel a migraine coming on and it stops it in its tracks.  i take it when i get a severe anxiety attack which is only once a week or once every two weeks.  I have gone sometimes three weeks without taking one.  I don't know if this makes me different than people posting here or not.  I dont feel any withdrawal when not taking it for two to three weeks and since i have it i am able to do things that I never did before.  I didn't even realize how bad my anxiety to certain situations was until i began this med.  I am more active than ever.

It has destroyed my health as well to the point i now legitimately have nervous system damage.

372, 5, GAD_ SAD_ panic attacks,Fatigue_ memory loss.,"CHEW THEM AND LET THEM DISSOLVE IN YOUR MOUTH!!!  I see lots of people saying that it took an hour to kick in.  This must be due to swallowing the pills whole.  These pills are even labelled as ""orally dissolving tablets"".  The makers understand that anxiety meds need to kick in quickly.  Dissolving the tablets in your mouth allows them to be absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth; I feel it within 1 MINUTE_ not 1 HOUR!  Yes_ the medication can have some side effects_ but for those of us with debilitating anxiety_ they are by far the lesser of two evils vs. suffering through the anxiety.  For anyone who has really bad side effects_ I would say that either this is not the right medication for you or you have some other underlying condition.  I feel like this med has helped to ""reset"" my brain to not be anxious if you will_ so I feel like I can start to come off it now that I've relearned to not be anxious_ as it is most definitely a self-perpetuating condition.

I had to get a tow truck to come get me due to the fact that the attacks were one after another and thought I was going to pass out the whole time. I was unable to drive for 4 weeks. I went back to my GP who then RX Klonopin .5 x2 day for panic. I took my first one and the next day I was driving. The Klonopin has not completely taken away the DR feeling_ but has allowed me to function and work as well as drive a car again. I am getting better_ I use to be scared abou thaving another attack while driving but have not had 1 attack since starting Klonopin. I am now with a PSY professional and starting CBT.

I have an extremely high tolerance to any kind of narcotics or opiates_ so my doc prescribes this for the longer lasting properties_ so my system didn't flush it out so quickly. I was given on an as-need basis_ because I don't want to be on anything EVERY day. ~ But this should be labeled as a 'sleeping pill' because when I took .5mg (1 pill)_ that's all it did after a FULL HOUR that it took to kick in. It totally knocked me out for one hour and then made me bitchy_ made my inner ears hurt_ exacerbated my pain (headaches_ joint pain_ lower back pain). It did not help me feel 'better' or have any less anxiety whatsoever. I cut the dose in half after the third day (.25mg) and it did absolutely nothing at all. So it's either one extreme or the other. On a positive note_ I will say that the first three days I slept really well_ even though I did not take it at night. I've switched to old fashioned Valium_ which is what I wanted to begin with_ but we thought I'd go through it in an hour and it would be pointless.

403, 1, Klonipin,Not even sure 'what caused what'...,I was initially prescribed Klonipin because I was 'big time' grinding my teeth at night. Saying it was a poor choice by the doctor would be a gross understatement_ but I digress. It defintely helped me sleep more soundly and stopped the teeth grinding(or atleast caused ne not to wake up while doing it). I've been on and off Klonipin (mostly on)for 13 years or so. It's hard to say exactly what it has done for me_ or to me_ over the years. I've also been on and off Prozac throughout the same period of time. Due to my aversion to Big Pharma and biochemical manipulation to address 'energetic' issues it's been harder and harder to justify using these these meds. My last stint with this 'combo' (starting 11/2010 and ending 4/2010) was coupled with Trazodone (for sleep) and Deplin (L-Methylfolate for 'mood' neurotransmitter metabolism). After 2 - 3 weeks I was feeling better and better. Unfortunately within 2 - 3 months or so the 'cocktail' started pooping out and I was getting worse and worse anxiety. Over the course of the next few weeks I increased the Klonipin from .5mg in the morning to 1.5 - 2mg. It didn't work and I melted down... massive anxiety to the point of derealization_ etc. It's been a bit over a month since this happened and I'm off everything but the Klonipin. Initially I 'cold-turkeyed' the Klonipin which led me to experience massive withdrawal symptoms_ including tremors and sweats. So I decided to go back on .5mg and wean down slowly.

404, 4, Bad_ constant anxiety: PTSD_ GAD,I don't believe I have experienced any side effects.,I am well aware of the dependency one can develop with a drug like Klonopin (same with Ativan and such). I also have an addictive personality I would say_ and would binge-drink out of depression and anxiety for over a year. I started taking Klonipin_ ONLY AS NEEDED_ and that is everytime I have to work which is a very high stress_ fast paced job. I also have been diagnosed with Bipolar II_GAD_ SAD_ PTSD_ and possibly clinical depression. I wanted to write this for anyone that may have fears of addiction: watch what you're doing_ and take as needed. I take 4x a week_ once a day_ and additonally if in emergencies. I do not take it to sleep unless it is an emotional emergency. Taking as need is ok_ as long as it is less than more_ otherwise you develop the risk of seizures if stopping on and off.

406, 3, social phobia_ panic attacks,drowsiness_ muscle weakness/soreness,Klonopin does get rid of physical symptoms of anxiety and make you feel calmer_ but does not address the core problem_ your irrational thoughts that you need to work on and are best addressed through conitive-behavioral therapy with a therapist.  I was prescribed to take the klonopin 3 times/day rather than as-needed.  Taking the medication regularly as prescribed will prevent panic attacks and make social situations a lot easier but also increase the chance of becoming addicted & dependent on the drug.  So I'm not sure whether to take this as-needed or regularly.  Any help or suggestions_ or sharing your experience is welcome by e-mailing me.

424, 1, Social Anxiety,I wouldn't know where to start and I'd surely not be able to mention all of the side effects.  On withdrawal there are so many symptoms you are just overwhelmed by the fact that they are caused by a low dose of one medication for a short period of time.  Any benefits of Klonopin are grossly outweighed by the suffering caused due to the side effects of withdrawal.,It has been almost a year since dealing with an addiction caused by only 30 days of use_ .5mg x 3.  Now even a single day's use on an intermittent basis can not be tolerated due to withdrawal a week or so later.  The amount of time suffering through mild withdrawal is much greater than the amount of relief received through one day's use.  I can go two weeks or more with no Klonopin and then use it one day with a mild dosage and suffer withdrawal effects days later.

It took weeks before I would take it. I was scared because of addition. Finally I took it. People in AA and my husband even told me to take it. I have been doing things I could never do years ago.I have been sober 25 yrs and feel great.,F,55,15  years,1/10/2010Email,Klonopin
445, 5, panic_ anxiety_ insomnia,None except daytime drowsiness_ a heavy-lidded stupid feeling. That was no fun.,Had panic and anxiety and insomnia (severe) on vacation in a timeshare. After 5 days no sleep_ walk-in clinic doctor prescribed 0.5 mg Klonopin at bedtime. He authorized up to 1.0 mg in order to sleep. This did the trick. But I have tapered down from 1st dose of 1 mg to 0.25 over 5 days. Intend to stop completely. Benzos are dangerously addictive and truly a demon if used daily (for most people). I regard this as for emergencies only. (Also have replaced occasional Lunesta with this. Lunesta causes panic in me after a day or two. Klonopin is a better drug for occasional severe insomnia),F,55,5  days,1/6/2010,Klonopin
446, 5, Anxiety,Drowsiness,"Klonopin is a miraculous drug_ but it MUST be treated with a great deal of respect. It is not to be used for recreational purposes_ and should be used rarely and only for ""breakthrough"" anxiety and panic. Using this drug just to ""feel good"" is a disastrous idea. For me_ a combination of Zoloft_ therapy_ and Klonopin helped me to overcome crippling fear_ panic_ and illness. The only time I take it every day is when I fly or travel. Many members of my family have also benefited from it and it was a godsend to my grandmother when she was dying.",M,25,10  years,1/5/2010,Klonopin
447, 5, Social Anxiety_ Insomnia,Drunk feeling while taking it in the daytime (even small amounts.),I have severe social anxiety that made working difficult. This helped tremendously when I started a new job that required a great deal of social interaction (and stress!) I broke the tablets up and kept them in my pocket to take when I felt anxious. It was helpful but I noticed that even small amounts made me lose my balance a bit and say things I might not normally say (kind of like being drunk.)For the past 6 years I have taken .5mg nightly but none at all during the day. I get a great nights sleep for the most part (as opposed to waking every hour with racing thoughts.) I still wake up once or twice each night but I can go right back to sleep. I'd like to stop taking it but I can't sleep as well without it. Unlike others I have never had a problem with developing a tolerance. In fact_ I have found that if I take double the amount_ I wake more often.,M,50,10  years,1/5/2010,Klonopin
448, 4, Sleep due to CFS,I take this drug only at night to help with sleep as people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome have problems with their sleep cycle.  It is a common drug for CFS and sleep.  I was at .5 mg for many years_ but the stress of long term disablity due to CFS had me increase the dose up to 6 mg.  I am now back at 2-3 mg at night.  I would have problems with sleep if I did not take it.,I cannot tell anyone not to take this drug because for me it has been the only way to sleep and be able to function during the day.  I am in the process of coming off of Gabitril which is a dreadful drug and after that I will begin the process of reducing Klonopin. Since I have been on it for 14 years I have no idea how long it will take if I can even get off of it.  I will feel ok with this drug if I stay at .5 mg but after so many years and the dependency I would say to others with anxiety_ depression and other illnesses to use a different drug as this is highly addictive.  Since so little is know about CFS most people with CFS do well at a very low dose as it is thought to help our brain function which is already foggy and fatigues easly.  I hope this helps.,F,60,14  years,1/5/2010,Klonopin

Within a few weeks my overall anxiety level was way down_ my mind calmed down_ and all my weird phobias/fears went away.  Terrible drowsiness and nodding off in class or at the computer_ but that went away after a few weeks.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES stop taking this cold turkey....I let my prescription run out a few times with no refills and had to wait days for my MD to OK it.

I started with 4 mg a day and weaned myself down to 2 1/2. This drug worked equally well for a sibling with similar problems.

Wonderful in helping me relax at night and feel sleepier but turns out after sleep test I have a more serious sleeping disorder. Taken off clonaz and put on Xyrem-- didn't have withdrawal.  Xyrem helps me sleep_ but bc of how it works would wake me up and didn't help w tossing/turning.  Doc added .5mg clonaz and is a miracle for me.  I did hear it stays in your system for up to 40 hrs so PLEASE take it lightly...I am going to start not taking it on the weekends.

Was going to see a dr re TMJ_ but first started Klonopin and realized TMJ pain was 95% gone.  Much less insomnia than pre-Klonopin_ even though I take all in the a.m.  ""De-realization"" I would often have -- especially around bright fluorescent lights -- unexpectedly (and pleasantly!) disappeared when I started Klonopin.  Started large_ sustained weight loss at same time as Klonopin_ so it is conceivable that one or two of these unexpected beneficial ""side effects"" were from that instead of the Klonopin.","A godsend for severe social anxiety.  I couldn't even talk to a clerk at the post office without my heart pounding and my voice trembling.  It was so bad people were suspicious I was trying to pull something over on them!  Social situations still make me a bit uncomfortable_ but it is a world of difference vs. the debilitating social fear I lived in before.  Presentations at work (performance anxiety) went from a situation of dread and avoidance to a minor and readily-handled discomfort.  I used to take a little booster before ""threatening"" social events_ but have rarely done so for the last seven years.  I know everyone is different_ but it is hard for me to relate to all the claims of tolerance developing_ i.e._ a need for escalating dose to maintain effect.  I learned almost 9 years ago the 1 mg works much BETTER for me than 1.5-2_ and also avoids sedation.  Have never had the slightest need or desire to up the dose since then.  And generic Klonopin (clonazepam) is DIRT CHEAP.  I get a 100-day supply of TEVA generic (they specialize in clonazepam) at Costco for $12.00)_ and you do NOT need to be a member (I'm not).

465, 3, agoraphobia_ panic attacks,intense withdrawals_ insomnia_ chemical dependency/ies,I have been taking Klonopin for going on 2.5 years now. Like any medication - it has it's pros and cons. At the time I started taking it_ my anxiety was so bad that I couldn't walk into any public setting without feeling panicked or without a racing heart. I was prescribed 0.5 mg 3x/day_ but under the doctor's discretion that this was something that would be effective short term and would not be used as a treatment to 'cure' my anxiety. So here I am 2.5 yrs later taking 0.5 2x/day. I would say my anxiety is definitely more manageable. I don't have that fear of impending doom looming over me that causes me to worry every second. However_ on the flipside_ I've come to the realization that I am completely and totally a slave to the drug. For example if I run out of my medication early and don't call my doc for a refill (as to avoid seeming like I'm drug seeking)_ I will get little to next to no (literally) sleep at all. Which can be mentally draining. So from a anxiety management standpoint I look at it as very effective_ but from a mental/dependency standpoint I look at it as being highly addictive and having many bad side effects when you go without it after having used it for a long period of time. I have friends who have been addicted to heroin who are now clean and told me that you experience VERY similiar side effects getting off benzodiazipines (i.e.klonopin_ ativan_ xanax).

I was very afraid I would have terrible withdrawal but I didn't.  I just took it slowly (it took me about 6 months) and really didn't have a problem.  My suggestion is that instead of cutting back ""cold turkey"" which can be scary_ alternate a smaller dose with your regular dose for a few nights then stick with the smaller dose once you are comfortable.

But of course there's the addiction catch: take it too often (daily is way too much_ in my opinion) and you'll likely suffer nasty hardcore withdrawal and the drug may lose some efficacy. In any case_ Klonopin is excellent for social situations or stopping panic attacks.

I look at it ths way - if you had diabetes you wouldn't just decide to quit your meds_ would you? Its the same with this - you have to keep taking it or realize that your old symptoms will still be there.

484, 5, Panic attacks_ severe anxiety,brain zaps_ severe dry eyes_ zero libido. but the disappearance of severe anxiety has so far outweighed those side effects.,Have been on Klonopin .5 mg/3xday for 7 years. Switched to it after took Xanax for 5 years & began to get narcoleptic. Doctor told me Klonopin would not be as addictive as Xanax. Am now very scared as new doctor has told me of withdrawal problems. The brain zaps started about 2 years ago & have become very painful. My eyes are now so dry that I have to take Restasis for relief & also got my tear ducts plugged. I'm not sure what to do_ as I never want to experience the anxiety & panic that I lived with for the first 26 years of my life. Xanax & Klonipin made me able to function in everyday situations without breaking out into sweats_ palpitations_ and crying jags. But it would be nice to have some libido again. Is celibacy worth it in order not to feel anxious all the time?

I never had major problems coming off of it in the past.  It really is a great drug.  It almost eliminates or at least brings significant relief from my crippling social anxiety and allows me to be myself and feel a little more confident.  While taking it_ I never feel shaky or panicky.  I take 0.5mg 2x a day_ which is a low dose.  Yes_ any drug of the benzodiazepine class can be physically/psychologically addictive_ but the key to avoiding dependence issues is to stay at lower dosages and increase it only when absolutely needed.  These medicines can be taken long term_ but tolerance tends to build after a few months.

Huge Mistake for ME! I was having vivid nightmares_ waking up at 4am_ wide awake-tossing turning-diffoculty returning to sleep.  Very low energy the next day and increased depression-crying spells and not wanting to exist. Horrible experience!

I have taken the same dose every night and never upped it.  I don't take it during the day.  If I can't sleep after taking it_ it makes me irritable and tired.  It did save my sanity at the time I started it_ but I know that if I ever try to go off it_ I may likely go insane or worse_ so it is hard knowing that I'm addicted.  I also believe it has gradually caused other health problems but would not know for sure unless I went off it.  What I hate the most is that someday I may go through hell trying to withdraw and it scares the hell outta me.  My advice is to try every other non addictive anti-anxiety med you can before you end up on benzos.  They save your life in one way - but destroy it in another.,F,53,20  years,7/2/2009,Klonopin

I've never been a drinker and have cut all stimulants out of my life. I know this medication is addictive_ I know I will develop a tolerance to it_ and I know I will end up taking more or switching to a higher benzo; but it is better than the alternative. My panic disorder has become so severe that I coudn't function in life and and couldn't handle feeling suicidal anymore. I would rather be a benzo junkie than dead_ plain and simple. I would suggest that people with this type of disorder leave the benzos as a last resort; TRY EVERYTHING ELSE POSSIBLE.

I began with 1.5mg/day and ended with 4mg/day 2 years later because I had built up a tolerance.  I used to take Ativan which I found to be extremely addictive and was switched to klonopin which_ for some reason_ was not addictive for me.  The bad news is one day_ about 2 weeks ago it seemed to just stop working out of the blue.  I had raging anxiety and I overdosed on klonopin by taking around 60-80mg.  Nothing happened and I had no relief.  THANK GOD I did not die_ go into a coma or end up in the hospital.  My psychiatrist was shocked that I had not fallen unconscious. I abruptly stopped taking the klonopin and was put on Librium.  For the next week I had horrific withdrawal symptoms. Severe depression_ suicidal thoughts_ horrible anxiety and panicky feelings and general physical discomfort as if my skin was crawling.  It has now been 11 days since I stopped taking klonopin and I am finally beginning to feel better.  It is possible I had a bad withdrawal because I had overdosed.

I'm trying to ride out the .75mg w/d effects now but how long will I not sleep?  I would never had taken this drug had I known this was going to happen.

I had intense vertigo_ dysphoria_ depersonalization_ shaking_ tremors_ the feeling that I was moving and shaking when I wasn't... The best part is_ I have been off Klonopin for almost 5 years now and I still suffer from many of the symptoms I had upon withdrawal.

Right now I'm at 1mg_ but I'll be at 1.5 or 2 the next time I go to my psych_ 'cause 1mg isn't working the same as it used to.

The brain quickly builds up a tollerance for this medication which will soon negate the benefits.  This results in the MD increasing the dosage.  Thus the cycle begins.  Withdrawal from this drug is slow and painful.  No long term studies have been done so no one knows what if any permanent damage happens to the brain.  I urge anyone thinking about taking this drug to AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS.  This includes all Benzos.,"Having been on this drug for 15 years here are some of the long term ""benefits"" you can expect:- depersonalization of ones self- complete loss of ability to empathize with anyone- the wonderful feeling of sleep walking through life- complete loss of all emotions- memory loss (no one knows if the loss is temporary or permanent)- an increased ability to feel listless_ dull and lethargic- loss of ability to connect emotionally with your spose/significant otherThese are but a few of the long term benefits you can expect.

579, 4, panic disorder,I was perfectly normal and healthy and then in june 08 I have had alot of medical issues that have come up for no reason. I have been diagnosed with thyroiditis and dirreah b12 vitamin d deficiency and  heart palps tachycardia tremors nervousness which may or not have been panic attacks. I lost 20 lbs from the dirreah and anxiousness and I was beginning to not have any appetite. I am still being worked up to try to find out why all these symptoms have just started.  I tried xanax at first which I had always taken when flying or as needed for years.  It did not really work to help me feel normal and not scared. Dr put me on  klonopin and I feel less anxious and able to get out of the house now and my appetite is back but have not gained weight back. I am scared to be dependent on this drug.  I have been on it about 3-4 weeks now about 1 mg a day. Dr wants me to take 2 mg a day but I am scared to get addicted.

Klonopins have a heavier onset_ making you not even think about panic attacks_ but at the same time_ your body can function just fine_ instead of playing chicken on the road under the influence of xanax. :D,M,24,4  months,9/25/2008Email,Klonopin

I spent about 19 yrs seeing psychiatrists_psychologists_behavioral therapy_hypnosis.Tried many different medications.NOTHING WORKED..Referred to a psychiatrist/drug therapist who gradualy brought me to 3-2mg rivotril a day. After mono subsided I felt normal for the fist time since my symptons started. No side effects. Afer about 10 yrs reduced myself to 2-2mg/dly. After a few more yrs. reduced myself down to 1-2mg/dly.Never had any symptoms of withdrawal.Holding on to the last one_I think_as security blanket. Never regretted taking it.,F,57,20  years,9/12/2008,Klonopin

When I stopped taking it_ my hair and eyebrows grew back to their previous thick and healthy condition.  Granted_ however_ it did help with insomnia initially but didn't help much with time.,I want to share how I successfully weaned off klonopin thanks to my psychiatrist.  He had me dilute a 1 mg. tablet in 6 oz. of water.  Each week I would take out one tablespoon of the mixture until I was down to nothing.  I had virtually no problems_ but I was augmenting the withdrawal with taking 50 mg. of trazodone.  I had tried to wean off of klonopin several years ago without any replacement and couldn't do it.  I was on klonopin for 18 years and finally got off of it!  I understand that trazadone is not addictive in the way klonopin is.,F,53,18  years,9/12/2008,Klonopin

589, 5, anxiety/panic disorder,none,I very suddenly developed severe almost hallucinogenic panic attacks when I was 14 or 15_ in 6 years I've been on almost every antidepressant/antipsychotic/anti-anxiety under the sun excluding prozac and lithium_(I also had depression and PTSD) but klonopin was the first and only real thing to work for my panic attacks_ not even xanax worked. I know people sometimes buy klonopin to get high_ but I was on .5mg for 6 years_ and even when I first started taking it never had symptoms_ never even got high off of it_ and occasionally during extremely bad panic attacks would take up to four .5mg pills at once. Klonopin is a wonder drug to me_ before it I was afraid_ and wanted to kill myself_ but now I am fine and drug free_ and I believe Klonopin helped greatly. I switched antidepressants constantly_ and Klonopin was the only constant during those 6 years. The best thing was that it worked almost immediately_ no waiting 3 weeks for it to get into your system.,F,21,6  years,8/24/2008,Klonopin

I'm getting good grades in all of my classes. It also helped me when interviewed at jobs. I was looking for a job for months and would get very nervous at the interviews and couldn't answer questions I was asked. But with the meds I was calm did very well at my interviews.

593, 1, Anxiety,Became extremely depressed and suicidal_ I was totally out of it had crazy irrational thoughts and behaviors. I felt drugged and couldn't remember anything. I felt awful like I had the flu or something...plus I hated myself and everyone else. I had a full-blown psychotic episode from this medication and I am thankful that me or my kids were not hurt. I only took the medicine for 3 days...3 days of HELL.,The last night I took Klonopin (dosage .05)_ I hardly remember at all. I remember having crazy thoughts and being suicidal. The next day_ I discovered that I had left my front door unlocked with the keys hanging on the outside of the door_ I had ripped a mole completely off my arm with my fingernails because I hated myself and then used 2 entire boxes of bandaids (on what I don't know) but the wrappers were all over the house and also blood soaked toilet paper was everywhere. My house was a complete mess. I wrote a terrifying e-mail to my husband who was in England and I do not remember doing it.

I've taken 4mg Clonazepam a day (in 2 divided doses) for social anxiety for 5 years.  It worked straight away_ it has given me confidence_ eliminated panic attacks_ I sleep really well and it appears to augment my anti-depressant treatment.  I have tried different dosages_ and as long as the dose was changed by no more than 0.125mg at a time I had no problem.  If you are going to take Clonazepam I would recommend going for the Roche brand as either Klonopin or Rivotril.,M,30,5  years,8/9/2008,Klonopin
595, 4, anxiety,Sleepiness_ drowsiness_ hair loss.,"I have had a fairly positive  experience with klonopin.  I had EXTREME anxiety about 13 years ago while getting my Master's degree.  The klonopin helped almost immediately.  I've tried to wean myself off the K about 3 times.  The first time was a disaster_ as I tried to come off too quickly.  The next 2 times would have been a success_ however_ life threw some curves at me_ and I continued.  I take 1.5 mgs at night every night.  I'll probably cut down to 1.0.  I think I am not as ""with it"" as I'd like to be_ but I'm avoiding the anxiety_ which was hell.  I've also experienced depression off and on my entire life_ and have had suicidal ideation occasionally my entire life.  I don't blame the drugs.  If one DOES choose to go off the K - do it S L O W L Y.  As in .25 less for 2 wks; another .25 less 2 wks; and so on.  Take it slow.  You'll be fine.

596, 4, Anxiety_ panic attacks,Mild sedation at start-up or following a dosage increase.  Tolerance and dependence does seem to develop_ resulting in a need to increase to the dose occasionally.  Increases the effects of alcohol slightly_ so be careful drinking.,Was on 0.5 mg/day for 4 years to control generalized anxiety and prevent panic attacks_ but started having severe panic attacks out of nowhere this past January.  After several dosage increases_ I finally seem to be doing pretty well on 3 mg/day (1 mg 3x daily) with much less anxiety and panic.  It works fairly quickly_ but does take a few days to really feel the full effects as it is longer acting than say Xanax or Ativan and builds up in the system.  Has a relatively mild side effect profile compared to some of the antidepressants I tried for my anxiety and it evens out my mood and temper better.  Am a bit concerned about building a tolerance to a given dose and becoming dependent - but this is far preferable to the debilitating anxiety_ panic attacks and insomnia I suffered several month ago.,M,30,4.5  years,7/24/2008Email,Klonopin
597, 1, Panic Disorder / GAD,Klonopin is an extremely potent benzodiazepine. I took Xanax for approx. 8 years until the drug stopped working for me. I started experiencing withdrawal symptoms while taking the xanax and thought I was going to lose my mind  and then die. I was then put on Klonopin and to my surprise_ it stopped my xanax W/D's dead in its track. This told me that Klonopin_ altho slower acting than xanax w/a longer half-life_ is just as potent. I personally consider klonopin the hardest benzodiazepine to detox from. I took the Klonopin for almost 9 years when it pooped out on me. I tried to double and even triple the dose to no avail. I spent 30 days in detox. My PD and GAD were magnified by a factor of 10. I had vivid dreams / nightmares of dying of heart attacks.I slept no more than 2 hours ea. night there. I was rushed to the local ER 2 times after having seizures and around the clock non-stop chest pains. My skin burned underneath like fire. I prayed to die actually. Benzo's are great if you are,Switch over to an equivalent dosage of valium and then titrate slowly downward after long-term klonopin and or xanax use.

I couldn't function at all... from the moment I woke up until I went to sleep it felt like my chest was in a vice-grip.  I finally relented to my doctor's recommendation of Klonopin (.5 mg/twice a day).  Within days I felt like I had gotten my life back!  I know there are risks involved with the Benzos_ but for me the benefits completely outweigh them... especially since I keep my dose steady and see my doctor weekly.  When it is time to come off the drug_ I know it will be very important to taper off of it very slowly to minimize negative side effects.,F,34,7  months,7/22/2008,Klonopin
599, 2, OCD_ Anxiety_ IBS_ Depression,Irritability_ sleepiness_ weight gain_ also cloudly thinking and muscle tension (when coming off),The surprising benefit of Klonopin to me was that it initally regulated my digestive system. I have irritable bowel syndrom (IBS)_ so this was a big plus. I fluctuate in weight a lot because of my IBS and severe problems with anxiety. I have trouble eating. I did gain about fifteen pounds while I was on this medicine_ for a little more than a couple of months. This might be a problem for some_ although it was a benefit for me. After being on it for a few weeks_ it didn't seem to help my digestive system as much though. The main reason I started it was for anxiety; I wake up in the morning literally trembling because I have so much anxiety running through me. Initially_ Klonopin seemed to help some. I started at .5 and worked my way up to 2. After a few weeks_ the benefits of the medication on easing my anxiety also seemed to stop. The main reasons I'm going off of the medication (aside from it not really working in any positive way anymore) are irritibility and sleepiness. The medicine,M,26,3  months,6/29/2008,Klonopin

I did take out the xanax but now Im trying to leave Clonazepam_ and is the same. I switch from one benzo to another not area to clean-up. Seems like both has the same potential to withdraw off (symptoms). Im just 1.5/ a day (0.5 _ 3 times a day). Is not as quick as xanax but is very potent to withdraw with and your body will feel the anti-anxiety about a day later after administration. If you are in extreme anxiety_ use it_ it works_ and I recomend over xanax (xanax has more potential to abuse of it) but is not_ try to stay away from any benzo_ including clonopin.",M,30,1  months,6/28/2008Email,Klonopin

618, 4, temporal lobe epilepsy,Sleepiness for the first couple of weeks_ that is all. Worked very well for my seizures_ preventing at least 3/4.  Problem was that it is easy to get used to_ and sometimes_ I would still have break-through seizures.  After some 15 years of taking it_ I weaned off it for various reasons. Withdrawal was painful and upsetting with strong side effects similiar to DTs but passed.,I find it disheartening that this drug_ which is primarly indicated for controlling convulsions_ is being handed out like candy for anxiety.  It is rather addicting and an addiction and withdrawals can be devestating for anxiety patients.  I hope doctors are taking good care of these patients.,F,45,16  years,4/11/2008Email,Klonopin
619, 4, Restless Leg Syndrome,None: when I took 1mg. at night_ I was a bit groggy the next day so I cut back to .05mg. but I also don't take it every night,This acts as a sleeping aid for me. My RLS is no longer a problem; I don't take Klonopin every night due to its addictive nature.

620, 3, Anxiety,Memory loss_ rapid heartbeat and severe withdrawal upon quitting.,I had been diagnosed bi-polar and was automatically given up to 3mg per day.  I wasn't told how addictive this was. I was told it was less addictive than other medications out there.  It's also fairly cheap with insurance.  I was told about a year ago by a new psychiatrist how addictive Klonopin is.  He told me if I were taking 2mg a day for 2 months_ it would be as bad a withdrawal as methadone (I had taken methadone for chronic pain and the withdrawal was the worst experience I have had).  A year after the suggestion I stopped taking it.  I had finally weaned down to .5 mg and when I ran out_ I didn't refill.  BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL IF YOU STOP any medication.  We really have no idea WHAT these drugs do to our bodies and what exactly they change.  If you immediately stop taking a drug that you're on a high dosage of_ it could make you extremely sick.  I stopped this a week ago and I'm still sick from the withdrawal symptoms.  Right now I'm very spacey_ feel depressed and anxious.,F,36,3  years,3/31/2008Email,Klonopin

CONS: after a few weeks the same dose doesn't effect me as much. when i first took it_ it totally mellowed me out. now_ it seems to do nothing (tolerance). Also_ Klonopin makes me feel dumb...i can't remember things_ and i feel like i'm drunk minus the good feeling_ just the stupid drunk feeling.,I work out a lot and since taking klonopin_ i have not been as strong in the gym. i get tired easily and feel weak.,M,21,2  months,3/31/2008,Klonopin

For those who absolutely LOVE this so-called medication_ I recommend you continue taking it. In fact_ I think you should take more of it. And then I suggest you start withdrawing from it (hey_ it hasn't hurt you_ right_ so why be afraid to stop it for a while?). You'll get exactly what you deserve!,F,55,10  years,3/31/2008,Klonopin

After much research_ I found out it was hormonal imbalance and pre-menopausal symptoms. The palpitations and shakiness were causing terrible health anxiety and panic attacks.  My family doctor put me on Klonopin (generic Clonazepam) .25mg which I split in half and I have my life back again. ATTN WOMEN OUT THERE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING PALPS AND SHAKINESS FROM HORMONAL IMBALANCE...this drug will help with those symptoms.  I highly recommend this.

645, 5, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Initial slight cognitive impairment.  Taking .5mg BID.,This drug is often grouped in with benzos (xanax_ valium_ etc.) but it's different because it also works on your serotonin receptors (which gives it antidepressant effects).  I switched over to this after years on Lexapro (which was really hard to get off -- and took 4 months).  I lost 25 Lexa-pounds_ felt mentally better and also physically better than on SSRIs.  I believe pharma companies positioned SSRIs as safer (less-addictive) to encourage SSRI use.  I've also come to believe that the risk of addiction is a small (and manageable) factor compared to the benefit of a simpler drug.  Having said that -- if you've had issues with addiction in the past_ don't take this drug.  Or_ if your dose stops working after 2 months -- klonopin (or other benzos) are probably not for you.  One last note.  If you are switching directly from an SSRI to klonopin_ you may not be able to fairly evaluate klonopin.

646, 4, Panic Disorder_ GAD,Cognitive/Memory Depression_ slight decrease in sex drive_ tolerance withdrawal_ emotional numbing.,"Overall this is a good drug for treating anxiety.  This is NOT a good drug for curing anxiety_ nor for staying on in excess of a couple months.  If you have been on this for more than a couple months_ it is suggested that you crossover to Valium and do a slow taper as advertised in Heather Ashton's manual at benzo.org.uk to avoid any crazy withdrawal symptoms.  In a nutshell_ Pros: Surpresses Anxiety/Excess Stress.  Cons: The Anxiety/Stress it surpresses will return 5 fold when discontinuing too rapidly.  Do not pay any attention to the ""this drug is the devil's drug"" or ""withdrawal is total hell"" nonsense.  Most of these are all drug-induced exaggerations which is caused in certain people_ though withdrawal can be tough and lengthy_ namely in uptight/high strung individuals.  It is best to deal with anxiety problems via cog/behavioral theropy.

The primary difficulty with this is getting off of it.  While you are on it though_ overall_ you might as well forget about anxiety.  Getting off it?  Plan on anxiety x 20.  Switch to a longer acting benzo like Valium or Librium and start a slow taper.  Remember though_ symptoms vary from person to person.  Your doc would be the best to help you with this but mention the switch to longer acting benzos.  Benzos help in the short_ but like other tranqs_ will cause more harm than good after a couple months.  Sometimes Klonopin withdrawal becomes the source of resurfacing anxiety. 90% of people are better off without benzos_ and just dealing with anxiety the ""old fashion way"".

Klonopin is a highly addictive and dangerous drug_ and benzo withdrawal can ruin someone's life (as it has ruined peoples lives here on this board).

Doctors don't know everything_ and esp. mental health doctors don't know how you feel.  These drugs effect your brain_ not theirs.  Be conscious of side effects and addiction and so forth -- klonopin is dangerous and addictive_ and if you do take it_ you must take it responsibly.

I tried going back to college_ and I think I have failed this semester.  In 2001_ I graduated with a 3.57 cum laude.  Now_ I feel like my mental capacity is that of a 70-year-old_ and I'm in my 20s.  Physical pain and muscle twitches beyond belief.  Hard to sleep.  Always exhausted.  Mood swings so severe that I was misdiagnosed as being bi-polar.  I'm hating my life and the person I've become on this drug.  I took an IQ test a few months ago_ and I got a 109.  All my other IQ tests before taking Clonopin were at least 145.  My stomach constantly hurts.  My heart beats fast for no apparent reason.  I get angry and agitated.  My anxiety has increased 10-fold with a drug that was supposed to decrease my anxiety.  This drug messed with my brain chemistry so much that I started using street drugs recently.,I recently saw a psychiatrist in my state.  He was trained in Europe.  Apparently_ it is no secret to the doctors there now dangerous_ addicting_ and destructive this drug is.  He was appalled that I've been on this drug for 6 years and that my other doctors never saw the red flag being waived at them.  The good news (I hope) is that he assured me that all of my problems and issues are due to Clonopin.  He even thinks that my bi polar diagnosis is due to rebound-effects of clonopin.  He seemed certain that after 9 months of discontinued use_ (YES_ 9 MONTHS OF WITHDRAWL--not a typo) my memory_ speech_ and overall physical and mental states will go back to what they were 6 years ago.,F,29,6  years,12/24/2007,Klonopin

I used it regularly for about a month_ then cut back to as needed.  I take 0.5 mg on average 3 times weekly.  I have gone almost 1 week without and had absolutely no withdrawel effects.  When used with caution_ this drug is a lifesaver.  I am on Lexapro which seems to do nothing for my anxiety so I am extremely grateful to have the Klonopin around.

I have taken street drugs_ every antidepressant known to man_ mood stablizers_ herbal rememdies_ and many other things.  This drug truly works wonders when taken as directed by the Dr.  It is the least addictive benzo_ which basically just means minor tranquilizer_ because of the 12hr 1/2 life.  Taking 2mg of this every 12 hours will keep a constant 3mg in your body working at a bare minimum.  1mg every 12 will be 1.5mg constant_ etc...  It relaxes_ causes less stress_ reduces panic and anxiety symptoms_ helps with sleep_ cuts manic symptoms down_ and reduces depression.  It is much more effective when used in conjuction with other drugs.  Prozac has always been a staple of mine because it elevates and has very few side effects besides the one everyone knows about (sexual).  With the help of these two drugs most things can be easily overcome.  They work for a wide variety of problems.  Adding,M,28,12  years,12/9/2007,Klonopin

She became and out of control alcoholic with no sane judgement what-so-ever.,My wife was given this drug as part of a cocktail that was the protocol for new admissions to the psych ward of our local hospital. She sought admission to the detox unit because her alcoholism had recently escalated. She was sent to the psych unit instead because of her history. She was becoming very self destructive and out of control. During the previous month her G.P. had also prescribed Klonopin something which I am amazed the hospital intake missed. After leaving the hospital she was maintained on Klonopin and continued a downward spiral which ultimately resulted in a car crash_ a conviction for drunk driving and a fear of hospitals and psychiatrists. As a result of her legal fees we were also forced into bankruptcy. After arguing against the prescription with her psychiatrist (the same one from the hospital) she weaned herself off this incredibly dangerous drug. We did research and found that this drug is counter indicated for people with alcoholism  Roche say so!,F,50,60  days,11/14/2007,Klonopin

I take it as needed and it crushes any kind of anxiety i'm experiencing and allows me to by myself in nervous situations such as speaking in front of a class or being around a lot of people.  Some find klonopin very addictive.  I don't personally but it should only be taken when you really need it.

694, 4, Anxiety_ insomnia,Drowsiness_ calmness_ feeling content.,My doctor switched me to Klonopin (.5mg) after having been on Xanax for years. She said it's safer to take long term. I take .5mg at night a few nights a week as needed. Xanax and Klonopin are very different drugs. The Xanax would hit within minutes and make me instantly calm. The Klonopin takes effect within an hour and is much more mellow. I feel relaxed but not drugged out. I actually like the Klonopin better because the effect lasts a lot longer. I read that the half-life is 18-20 hours whereas Xanax is 6-8 hours. I think in general is a good drug if you are looking for a long term solution to anxiety issues. Xanax packs more of a punch_ but it's also more addictive and shorter acting.,F,30,30  days,9/21/2007,Klonopin
695, 3, Anxiety Disorder,Sleepiness_ loss of energy_ headaches,For short-term use_ Klonopin is great and miles beyond the more commonly prescribed Valium.  It seems to be more effective for long(er)-term treatment of anxiety than Xanax or Valium since it lasts about 8 hours_ but it only really works the best if you keep a constant amount in your bloodstream.  I started to get headaches if I didn't take it every 8 hours_ so my doctor decreased my dosage to taking it at night only to sleep - which meant it would wear off and do nothing during the day by morning.  I would recommend this over most of the other benzos except for Xanax XR_ which seems to eliminate the problem of multiple daily dosages and is less sedating and addictive while being just as effective.,M,22,6  months,9/21/2007,Klonopin

I became very dependent after 9 months_ although I did not crave the drug.  Getting off was a nightmare.  Since benzos actually change the receptors in the brain_ once one is off the drug_ effects linger for quite some time.  I urge anyone thinking about this drug or already on it to go to benzo.org.uk to understand more about it.  Also go to www.health.groups.yahoo.com/group/benzo for a very supportive on line forum.

Two or three years ago I would have rated this med a 4 or 5. But I am now up to 3-4 mg/day just before bedtime to achieve the same effect.

Doing in on my own has been a complete failure. With great difficulty_ I can titrate myself temporarily down to 1 mg/day. At 1 mg/day_ I begin to have extreme anxiety attacks_ unreasonable fears_ and insomnia. I will go for 2-3 day without sleep as my anxiety builds and my fear of having a seizure increases. My seizure disorder has been linked to sleep deprevation so this concern amplifies my anxiety. My Dr. and the pharmacist say titrate at a slower rate. Easy to say_ but how do you do that when your mind and body are demanding more_ not less? I am at a loss at what to do next. My choices seem to be stay on the drug indefinitely or face a period of hell of unknown duration. At least three different Drs. and two Phars. have told me that this is a good medication and has been used successfully for years. The problem is that the vast majority of Drs. and Phars. have never used Klonopin_ andhave no personal experience with the side effects_ or the difficutly getting off Klonopin. My advise to anyone considering taking Klonopin is don't_ find a non-addictive alternative_ or if you feel you must take it_ don't use it for more than one month.,M,63,7  years,5/23/2007,Klonopin

Time to get off this nasty shit!,It works great for anxeity. Didn't help with insomnia after week 2. Makes you a emotionaly numb zombie. After taking it for three weeks; I'm having nasty (shaking/tremors_ panic attacks_ rash covering most my body) withdrawls trying to reduce my 1mg dose each night by 1/8th a mg every 1-2 weeks. I'm down to 1/2 a mg at night after about 4 weeks_ that was easy... Trying to go any further then that leaves me unable to sleep and feeling like I just drank 4 cups of coffee.

I only took it for 9 days and quit c/t_ not knowing that I could be addicted. 2 days later I entered hell. I reinstated immediately & tapered slowly for the next 5 months. I've been off it for two months. The taper was a nightmare which got worse when I was off the drug completely. My anxiety is much worse. I'm finally back to sleeping 5-6 hours most nights_ but it's weird sleep _ with nightmares_ and I wake up feeling weak_ shaky and anxious. I've had horrible neck pain which I'm seeing a chiropractor for. I've also got this buzzy feeling in my brain that is almost unbearable. This has been so hard on my kids. I haven't been able to work since August. Stupid doctor tried to tell me it's all in my head. Therapist thinks I should be thru the withdrawal.

My side effects have been minimal_ i.e._ short-term memory loss_ dry mouth and_ of course_ feeling very tense if I don't take my half tablet on time (I take 1/2 a .5 mg. tablet 2-3 times daily).  I've read some of the other reports on the board and understand that withdrawal is something not to be desired_ but my doctor told me I'd have to be on Klonopin lifetime_ as my neuropathy became irreversible_ so for me this is not a factor.The amazing thing is that I've been taking 1/2 to 3/4 mg. daily now for 21 years_ and have not had to increase it over 1 mg. which is the most I've ever had to take on a very bad day_ ie._ I've not built up a tolerance.

I try to avoid taking it when I'm not going to class because I don't want to become dependent_ but it is definitely hard sometimes.

I also get a bit tired during the day but nothing proper nutrition and exercise doesn't help. I also have ocassional dizzy spells.,Despite knowing i'm physically addicted to it_ I love it because it's the only drug I can take that helps my panic attacks and alleviates insomnia (in conjunction with another med) and helps the agitation that comes from Bipolar. And I'd rather have a dependency than live my life with those illnesses. I went a year and a half without needing to increase my dosage.

It works quickly- so if I feel a panic attack coming on- I can stop it from becoming full-blown.  I take this medication at night when my anxiety levels are highest.  Now I can't fall asleep without it.  I definitely know when I've missed a dose because I literally buzz like I've had a cup of coffee.

766, 5, anxiety,None that I know of.,"I began taking the generic form (Clonazepam) .5 mg as needed for dealing with the stresses of my day.  I am an alcoholic_ so I figure that many folks get to have their beer after work; I take a Klonopin/Clonazepam.  It takes the edge off the stress off making the transition from the office to home (three young children).  I don't think to take it if there is nothing causing extra stress--not a daily need.  I think that it makes me a nicer and more agreeable person--less irritable; dealing with family matters I have less time to ""get away"" to reduce my stress level.  I began taking this drug after I began having infrequent and severely disabling reactions to extreme stressers.  I figured that something to reduce my overall stress level would help my overall health.  Was told by the MD that this drug would be quick-acting and not so long-lasting.

I did notice that I can no longer run on just 5 or 6 hours of sleep a night.,This drug worked miracles for me_ I was on the verge of a breakdown when I went to the doctor and she prescribed this for me.  I've had episodes before of depression and/or almost nonstop panic attacks and was given several SSRI's which worked for a while but then made me mean and nasty after 2-3 months.  I've been on this for 7 months now and haven't had any anger issues.  I've also started exercising 4-5 days per week for at least 1/2 hour and that's helped with my anxiety.  If you're going to take this drug_ I recommend using it as a crutch while you work on finding natural ways to control your problem so you can either get off the med eventually or stay on a very low dose.

771, 5, sleep disorders_  PTSD_ Bipolar II,Have taken 2 different times. Definately withdrawal/rebound problems.

So_Klonopin over side effects/dependency any day! I have changed the dosing time from bedtime to late afternoon. Initially_ I took it at bedtime_ and was changed by my dr. to late afternoon.

I can't really drive while I'm on it because I am really sluggish for a while_ so I only take it when I don't have to drive or be responsible in any way for anything like that.

No problems at all. For awhile I went from 2mgs daily to 1mg daily and I was good. I'd say when I tried to go from 1mg to .5 mg is when I got scared_ felt panicky again/panic attacks_ and went back up to 1mg. I believe I could have weaned down further with the help of a doctor/other medicine. Anyway I am now on 2mgs and it is maintenance for me_ keeps panic attacks away.

794, 4, Depression,Weight loss_ loss of libido_ low motivation.,Klonopin does what it's supposed to (reduce anxiety) by pretty much numbing you to everything else in life_ too.  It does take the edge off anxiety_ but the price is lack of excitement and spontaneity in the other aspects of your life.  If you're in a work enviornment that rewards effort and creativity_ this isn't for you.,M,59,5  years,11/6/2006Email,Klonopin
795, 4, Anxiety,Not sure if I had any.,Definitely better than Xanax which would give me the benefit then the withdrawl if I didn't take it regularly. I was taking a very low dose (5/8 .5) at bedtime. A couple times I tried to quit and took half of my usual dose and woke up after about 4 hours sleep and the rest of my sleep was very light and I felt bad the next day. So I thought I NEEDED the stuff to sleep. It wasn't until I start weaning slowly (dropping 1/8 of the .5 very few days) that I was able to see that I could sleep just fine without it. My anxiety is back though because I never had therapy and facing similar stressors that gave me the anxiety in the first place.,M,43,1  years,11/3/2006,Klonopin

I was a wreck_ crawling on my hands and knees home from school because I was so distraught over something. Klonopin is my Godsend and I simply don't function without it. The couple of times I have tried to ween off of it the withdrawals were hell_ I'm going to be honest. I had the shakes_ I couldn't sleep_ I was restless and couldn't sit still_ it felt like my entire body was tingly_ adn the oddest of all was that loops of phrases would get stuck in my head and play over and over_ much like when you get a song stuck in your head. It made me feel like Rain Man with his ""Wopner_ wopner."" All in all_ though_ the truth is life with Klonopin is far more satisfactory than life without it and I don't mind taking it everyday for the rest of my life simply because it makes life more enjoyable as opposed to the hell that it is without it.",F,21,11  years,10/24/2006,Klonopin

The only downside is that I want to eventually wean off this drug because I am getting married soon and I may want to have a child down the road. I know this medicine is dangerous to take while pregnant so I don't want any problems when that time comes. However_ I have already tried weaning off it and I can only get so far before I get bad hallucinations. It is the scariest thing I have ever experienced. If I could someday take this pill on an ""as needed"" basis_ that would be much better than having this dependency.

Before starting klonopin my anxiety got so bad that I didn't want to leave the house and could not function at work. I got put on Klonopin after my grandmother ( who to me is my mother) started her battle against terminal cancer. This alone crashed my world down_ I was begining to have panic attacks daily to a point I would avoid leaving the house and taking sleeping pill just to get away. I was also starting to be a extreamly heavy drinker which made my situation even worse. Since taking this drug_ along with my celexa I am me again. It doesn't block your feeling about what is going on around you_ it just helps you deal with it. I think starting Klonopin was the best thing for me to do in this time of life.

If you're at the end of your rope go for it and put yourself on it forever_ but only if you're hopeless.Getting off of this drug cost me $30_000 and 6 weeks in the hospital.

Klonopin manages to keep me from being a jittery ball of nerves without blunting my intellect and ""appropriate"" concern and anxiety. This is good. I was on Xanax for two years. I am switching to Klonopin to taper off; we'll see once that's over whether I need it anymore or not. (I certainly did need something at one point.) Oh_ and definitely don't go cold turkey off of a daily dose of a benzo. I did that last week with Xanax_ before switching to Klonopin. Muscle spasms and the whole works. (2mg.)

I've been told I will never get off of it. Never have children. Never really feel again. The doctors and drug companies don't tell you any of this.

My father recently died and due to family uproar_ I had terrible insomnnia. I was rx'd wellbutrin for depression_ but that unfortunately can increase anxiety and insomnia (thought for me_ it's the best antidepressant). During this period_ I had horrendous insomnia and klonopin really helped: it helped me calm down and it helped me relax enough to sleep. Much_ much better than xanax becaues of the longer half-life: no rubber band effect.,I love it. It makes me able to cope when life spins out of control. I have PTSD_ and although that sounds ridiculous_ as though only combat vets should have it_ it IS true that every day people can have their CNS so damaged by continuous emotional trauma that our brains go into an overdrive of panic during extremely stressful times.

837, 3, Panic attacks,difficulty thinking_ basically feel a little drunk all the time. Was on it for only 1 month at 2mg/day and tried to taper in 2 week timeframe_ I got VERY DEPRESSED. My psychiatrist said we tried to taper too fast (was trying to get off it for school) so now I'm on .5mg twice a day for a month. I felt so depressed but it didn't happen until I was off it for a week so I didn't associate it with the Klonopin at first.,Panic attacks stopped. I was taking 2mg/day for 1 month now down to 1mg/day for the next month. I hope I can quit without the panic attacks and severe depression coming back. I had no idea the withdrawals would be this bad. I had suicidal thoughts and thought I was losing my mind.,M,27,2  months,4/30/2006,Klonopin

840, 5, Anxiety/panic disorder/PTSD,some drowsiness_ but that is SO welcomed after shaking and never being able to take in a full breath of air from severe anxiety.,I generally begin with 1 mg 2x/day during the anniversary of my son's death_ then I taper down to 1 mg/day split into two doses (.5 in the am and .5 in the pm).  After the acute PTSD subsides_ I taper down to .5/day for 2-3 months.  I use it like this every year and I do not have the bizarre side effects listed by anti-klonopin users.  Without klonopin_ I suffer from severe PTSD_ nightmares_ insomnia_ panic attacks and anxiety and would never be able to function.  I need this medication_ it is the only one that has ever worked.  For those of you who had a bad experience with it--quit trying to scare everyone with your negative experience.

It takes away my GAD and reduces my obsessions a lot. It helps with sleep. I've also had a headache for 16 years contant and it actual helps me deal with the unending pain.  Well_ I've gotten betterover the years and have tried to get off of it once or twice...I only take .5mg QHS now_ but if I miss a dose for two days straight I cannot sleep more than 3 hours a night.  I haveto many mental issues to deal with insomnia. For me_ its just easier to stay hooked at .25mg or .50 than to stop taking it. As long as a doctor prescribes it to me_ I will take it_ because I don't want to suffer through withdrawls...I've suffered enough in this life.  There was no Zyprexa or equivalent when I started taking Klonopin...If you use thisdrug long term_ you might just have to stay with it for lifeor suffer.,M,37,15  years,4/21/2006,Klonopin
842, 5, gad/panic,some day time sleepiness nothing horrible but you will build a tolerance for the drug.,Klonopin did not rate a 5 for me but I wanted my comment to be placed near the top. I would rate it as a 3. On a average only 8% of people in the united states actually suffer from anxiety caused by a chemical imbalance the rest could come from hormone imbalance or life stressors. If you are the 8% benzos will become a big part of your life along with a great battle but if you are just worried or something just is not going right in your life is no need to start such potent and chemical alternating drugs they are plenty of alternatives. I hope this helps someone.,M,21,1  years,4/14/2006,Klonopin

845, 3, Anxiety_ ADD,It worked like a charm at first. Then tolerance kicked in. Eventually_ I needed it to handle any stress at all. Addiction/tolerance builds quickly with this drug. Very seductive. Instead of feeling better_ you feel nothing when you take this. You are numb to the outside world. Eventually_ that's all you want to feel_ nothing_ so you take more_ or you take it more often.Try an SRNI instead_ those have been great for me. I'm on Cymbalta now.

I feel like I'm brain damaged sometimes and in my down times I ruminate about being so. I have a really hard time writing papers for school (college) but it's particularly noticeable in conversation. Every single day I have trouble finding the words I need in order to communicate. IT IS HORRIBLE. During summer break I'm going off of this med.

I see Klonopin as an 'as needed' drug and respect it as much. Don't take it every morning if you don't need it! Don't take it EVER if you don't need it and the less you take the better... OF COURSE. Doctors may say take it daily but there is no need for it if your not going into a panic situation where you know you'll feel anxiety.

However_ then I went onto this site and read the problems that people had getting off of it. So_ I stopped taking it_ and only after a few days with a low dose I experienced sharp pains in my head with some nausea.  I've never experienced that type of headache before.

I was involved in 2 traffic violations within 3 days.  I was so angry that I would scream at my family.  Once I was so mad that I threw my set of heavy car keys at my mom.  It did not do anything to help my stress level.  I began to suffer from mild panic attacks.  It is a BAD medication and I would recommend not to try it.  It does more harm than good.

Had problems urinating and at times stopping the urination. I could not remember things that happened a week earlier. Probably the worst was my behavior changes. My girlfriend said whenever I took a 2mg klonopin_ she could tell because my personality changed to an aggressive_ argumentative and angry man. I didn't notice until I was arrested for arguing with a police officer.,"I did research and discovered I am one of the less common people in whom klonopin turns into a Jekle/Hyde personality and not a nice person to be around. The odd thing is that my Doctor responded when I told him of my behavior change with_ ""It should make you calm down and go to sleep!"" WRONG!! To me it was a one way ticket to jail. I quit immediately taking klonopin. It has been since July 2005 (it is today 12/20/05) and my memory is just now getting better and my mind is clearer.

With Klonopin_ I try to skip days and do not take more because I realize that I could become addicted to the warm and fuzzy feeling and then it won't work. The drug helps me with my anxiety.  When I am feeling anxious_ I take it and I then have the will to do stuff.  It's also an excellent sleeping aid.  I've tried other benzos_ but this drug works the best for me.  I worry about becoming dependant on it.  I probably am.  I've been on it since 1998 and have tried to wean myself off it at times_ but I can only do four days before my anxiety is unbearable.

It always did exactly what I'd hoped it would do_ and I don't remember any negative effects while taking it except perhaps some memory loss.,Going off this drug was hell. It was possibly the hardest thing I've ever had to do_ and I developed a number of permanent changes from being on it for a long time.The least of it was terrible insomnia. Other ODD changes were things like tremors_ BIG uncontrolable jerkiness_ and uncontrollable constant finger movement. The oddest was that it seemed like-when a song gets stuck in your head_ only it was 100 times louder and absolutely constant.If you are on this drug_ it will be unbelievably helpful_ but keep in mind there may be long term consequences (that can be lived with) and a very difficult period of going off it.,F,33,3  years,8/23/2005Email,Klonopin

881, 1, Insomina/anxiety,Worsened anxiety_ weakness_ loss of mental acuity_ fatigue_ withdrawal symptoms,Be careful.  I was rx 1-2 .5 mg tabs/day_ but I knew enough to realize that a long half-life drug like Klonopin should not be taken at the same frequency as a short half-life benzodiazapine like Xanax.  So why are doctors prescribing them the same way?  If patients truly take 2 tabs/day_ there would be an incredible builup in your system in as little as a week.  I took 1 tab every 3 or so days at bedtime.  For the next couple of days I would feel like a weak_ emotionless zombie.  After a couple of weeks_ I realized that as soon as the Klonopin started to wear off (usually 2 days later)_ my anxiety would rebound ten fold.  So_ I tapered and eventually stopped.  Now_ two weeks after my last tab_ I feel horrible withdrawal symptoms.  My anxiety is in check_ but I still feel physically weak and shaky all the time.  I have never felt this way before_ and I am taking no other meds.  This stuff made me feel gross_ and I took it incredibly sparingly.  My doctors refuse to acknowledge that I developed some form of physiological addiction to this drug.  A long half-life means this stuff stays and accumulates in your system.  Therefore_ it's only logical that your body is going to have a tough time getting rid of this junk when you stop.,M,25,21  days,8/8/2005,Klonopin

However_ this is only true of the generic drug.,I was sexually abused as a child and have been taking this drug for over 14 years and would not be alive and functioning if it were not for Klonopin. I have never had any side effects_ except for being too tired if taken too early before rising. But that would be the true of anyone without a nights sleep. I was only on 1 mg all these years and took it PRN. I have gone weeks without taking it and never had a withdrawal effect(not true for Paxil_ which I took for 1 year-that was hell).  I now just keep Klonopin around for security and take it only at night or when panic sets in_ which is once every 2 weeks on average.  I am sorry people have had such bad problems with it. For me it was a miracle drug for extreme_ disabling panic.,F,48,14  years,6/26/2005,Klonopin

892, 5, anxiety / insomnia / hypnic jerks,None really_ aside from drowsiness_ which was the goal.  I can see it being very addictive though.  It flat out makes you feel good and relaxed.,I was in a very bad state when I first started Klonopin.  I had severe insomnia with hypnic jerks (for those who don't know what these are - every time you start falling asleep_ a body part will involuntarily move and wake you back up).  Hypnic jerks are generally associated with high levels of anxiety (too much brain activity causes the neurons to fire out of control).  I was at a point where I had not slept for the good part of a month.  The occasional times I did fall asleep_ I would wake up within 2 or 3 hours with my heart racing_ and feeling completely wired and unrested.  I was at a point where I was having a true nervous breakdown because of lack of sleep.  I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he prescribed the Klonopin.  I took a 1 mg pill that night and slept restfully for about 7 or 8 hours.  It totally killed the jerks.  I still felt tremendous anxiety over the next couple of weeks_ but I kept taking the Klonopin religiously every night and it would get me to sleep.  With each passing day_ my anxiety seemed to drop lower and lower.  After those initial couple of weeks_ I felt like myself again and_ being aware of the addictive quality of the medicine_ stopped taking it every day and would only take it if I absolutely couldn't fall asleep.  It is now 8 months later and I no longer take the Klonopin regularly.  I do_ however have some around still and like the idea that it is there. I will pop one every once in awhile if I feel a bit wound up and can't fall asleep.  My psychiatrist says that it's fine to do that as long as I don't use it daily.  All in all_ I feel it's a great medication if used properly and not abused.  It was great for breaking the insomnia cycle_ lowering my anxiety_ and me feeling like I had regained control over my life.,M,29,8  months,6/1/2005,Klonopin

956, 4, Panic/Anxiety from IBS,Pleasant sense of comfort and general relaxed sensation if taken with food_ otherwise it tends to encourage sleepiness. Will make you tipsy-like dizzy for 4 hours. Absolutely do not drive under the influence of this drug.,1 mg pure (generic) taken only as needed_ and with a healthy respect of its very addictive nature - approximately once or twice a week whenever there was intolerable stress-cramping.,M,35, ,4/7/2004,Klonopin

959, 4, Panic Attacks,The drug,To help counteract the tranquilizing effects of klonopin while still being calm and keeping anxiety at a minimum my psychiatrist prescribed a drug called Provigil.  It helps me stay awake and doesn't make me jumpy_ as caffeine would.,F,20,3  days,2/24/2004,Klonopin

Usually sleep well but have nights when I wake up still.  Found that 5mg time release melatonin along with the Klonopin seems to help regulate sleep cycle better.  Increases time in REM sleep for me in the early morning.  Have found several literature references that back this up.,M,52,2  months,9/26/2003,Klonopin
964, 1, Anxiety/Panic Attacks,,Warning!I was given Clonazepam for panic attacks and anxiety over a year ago_ the doc that prescribed it to me told me that it was not as addictive as some of the other benzos. He told me to take .50mg in the morning and .50mg at night but I decided to only take .25mg in the morning and .25mg at night. After only taking it for 30 days I decided that I did not want to continue taking it because of all the horror stores of how hard it is to get off benzos once you start. My doc told me not to stop treatment but I decided to taper off on my own anyway. I cut down my dose over the course of a week and felt totally fine. My first thought was all those people complaining of withdrawal are full of$&!@! Well one week latter is when all hell broke louse! I woke up and felt as if someone had given me a hit of LSD. I felt as though I was losing my mind! I was&$@!ed up (excuse my language) but that is the only was I can accurately describe that state I was in. I stayed that way for over 6 months and I still dont feel Pre-clonazepam after a year. I suffer from depression and some DR still_ which I never had before the Clonazepam. I know it helps a lot of people function but its a deal with the devil as far as I am concerned and sooner or latter the devil will want his pay! Here are some things that you may not know about Clonazepam: It has a 50 hr half life which means it takes 50 hours for it to dissipate to half of the does that you took. Sounds good to most and a lot of doctors say that is a good thing but here is what they dont tell you_ If your doc tells you to take 1mg twice a day that means by the end of only one month your steady plasma level of Clonazepam will be around 30 to 40 mg and that is no lie! You have now created havoc on your GABA system and you are officially an addict even if you dont want to be. This is the most dangerous Benzo on the market as far as I am concerned. I recommend using one of the shorter half life benzos like xanax only a few times a week or so. And for all you that havent had a problem or are currently taking it I pray that you never go through what I went through. Good luck and God Bless,M,30,30  days,8/6/2003,Klonopin

Stopped this by taking .5 mg only at nite (1 hour before bedtime),Did not realize how much anxiety I had been suffering with until after starting this drug.I only used Klonopin for about4 weeks until the Paxil kicked in. I had not slept for days because of depression and was beginning to lose my mind. Even Ambien could not help me at this point because I was so wired_ but Klonopin did the trick - MAJOR relaxation. Can definitely see why this drug might be abused.,F,41,4  weeks,1/9/2003,Klonopin

But this was a bad thing in the end_ because there were a lot of times that I should have taken it_ but was put off by the ""advice"" that other people gave me.  Also_ because it put me to sleep_ when I was having bad anxiety I could then get to sleep - very good ""side effect""!  I can't say it really took the anxiety away though_ hence the '3' rating.",F,24,4  months,9/29/2001,Klonopin
