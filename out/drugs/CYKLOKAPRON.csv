0, 5, Very Heavy Periods,Back pain. Feels like somethings is being pulled down my back_ like blood moving. Doesn`t hurt that much just strange sensation,My Doctor gave it to me as I have abnormally strong periods for my age and told me that if i felt anything bad to stop straight away. I am heavy for my age so she though i would be fine to take it like a grown up. It stops my bleeding for about 5 hours_ so I can get on with normal life. Usually I would have to wear a nappy like pad in bed or my sheets would have blood on them when i woke up. I usually take it at least twice a day but my doctor said I could take it up to 5 pills. I am very anaemic and have to take medicine for that too. I was wondering if it would react? my iron tablets are maltofe.,F,13,3  months500 MG 3X D,12/3/2013Email,Cyklokapron

2, 5, Heavy Periods,Blood seemed a bit 'dry' and didn't flow the same way. There was an increase in light clotting_ but then again that's the idea.,It works well for heavy periods.I used it for the 1st 3 days of my period each month. I think it was twice a day.I used it throughout my 20s_ as I often haemhorraged and couldn't contain my monthly bleeds.Although it was expensive_ a bottle lasts a long time.I have only discontinued it_ as I suspect it is bad for your health longterm_ although my female GP says it's not.It decreased the frequency of my anaemia and made periods more manageable.I advise trying it_ if your GP suggests to.,F,38,5  years30mg 2X D,8/9/2013Email,Cyklokapron

5, 2, control heavy periods.,15oo mg a day and it only slightly helped control amount of bleeding. Had to stop taking it after 2 days as it caused severe nausea_ vomiting_ and dizziness. Felt like a bad case of the flu and I could not get up. When I stopped taking it_ symptoms cleared right up within hours. Glad it helped others but personally would not recommend it.,,F,49,2  days500 3X D,2/2/2013Email,Cyklokapron

14, 5, Very heavy periods/cramping,Cannot directly relate anything to tablets.,Taking 2 tablets_ three times a day for 3-4 days of period.  Has given a much needed respite from flooding and very painful cramps.,F,45,3  months,8/4/2008,Cyklokapron
15, 5, Very Heavy Menstrual bleeding,I have been taking this medication for over 2 1/2 years now due to severly heavy menstural bleeding and cramping.  Before being prescribed this medication _ which I take  2 pills twice a day for every day of the bleeding_ I was bleeding so heavily that I wound up in the ER/A&E.  Not a pretty sight.,This medication is a god send.  It has cut the amount of bleeding down by about 25-30% and the cramps by about 25%.  I used to not be able to get out of bed before when I was on my period_ now I can just about make it through the day.  And for some reason_ either this medication or my moon cup(www.mooncup.co.uk) the length of my period has gone down by at least a day as well!!,F,23,2  years,11/10/2006,Cyklokapron
