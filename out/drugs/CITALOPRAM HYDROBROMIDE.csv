1, 5, Servere panic attacks_ couldnt brea,Very tired the first day and I took it at night as my doctor recommended_  but after taking the second night slept great again and woke up feeling much better.,For atleast six months before citalopram I was having spells where I couplet breathe..face was tingling..my right eye would droop..facial paralysis. .leg and feet tingling and more and it would last for hours at a time.  Up to 24 hours. Would slurred my words..have terrible memory problems etc.  Two of my kids won't talk to me cuz they think I was drunk all the time.  Turns out i was having panic attacks.  But here's the kicker. When I was feeling like that I wasnt feeling stressed out at all. I only found out that's what it was because I drive to my ppc when I was having a bad spell..4 hours into it...and sure enough. Sometimes I couldnt remember how to spell my own name. I was seriously. Thinking I was getting dementia at 46.  Im so thankful she put me on this.  Best of luck to you all.,F,46,2  days20mg,2/22/2015Email,Citalopram hydrobromide
2, 4, anxiety,Since taking this antidepressant I feel much calmer. For the first 2 weeks I had all side effects but gradually they are disappearing.  Highly recommended for panic and anxiety,,F,32,3  weeks20,1/18/2015,Citalopram hydrobromide
3, 4, Severe Clinical Depression,More suicidal thoughts for the first few days but I was used to that as I had been on other anti depressants. Made me very tired and I felt very numb and would often engage in reckless behaviour.,Although there were some side effects it appeared to work because I have been off medication for 11 months now :),F,16,3  months50mg,12/29/2014,Citalopram hydrobromide
4, 3, depression,Had weird thoughts such as spouse cheating with my friends knowing it was not true but had those type of thoughts,,M,36,1  days20 mg,9/17/2014,Citalopram hydrobromide
5, 3, panic_gad,A burning sensation through my body like flame that was unexpected and it cause me the biggest panic attack ever.I stop it immediately.,It was working but the burning sensation is something i dont want to experience again i cant rate the drug maybe its a rare side effect that hit only me.,M,37,10  days10 1X D,7/6/2014Email,Citalopram hydrobromide

7, 2, stress and mild depression,Bad night sweats_ headaches_ dry skin_ dry mouth_ lack of concentration_ dizzyness_ cramping muscles_ sexual dysfunction. Also brain zaps which was from withdrawal.,The worst thing about SSRI's and citalopram in my experience is that it was one of the worst for side effects (although slightly easier to come off them than others). Despite this after only taking for 4 months I had withdrawal symptoms after stopping taking them for nearly 4 weeks. I dont recommend you stop taking without advise from a doctor. However something inside we to stop taking them_ so in that sense I knew when i was getting better in that the side effects were worse than my condition. I probably should of carried on taking for longer but I decided I didn't want meds unless I was feeling it was going to save my life.,M,36,4  months20 1X D,4/6/2014,Citalopram hydrobromide
8, 3, Panic attacks_ low mood,Sweating and papitations after starting on 20mg. Slight dry mouth and headache. Lack of motivation.,20mg was too high a dose for me to start on and maintain. I settled at 15mg. My panic attacks stopped within 7 days of taking this medication and I still have a sex drive. It is available in 10mg tablets and be aware less is sometimes more with these drugs. Escitalopram is an even cleaner version of the drug_ wish I'd known about this earlier. Withdrawal causes you to feel worse for appx 10 days then you level out.,F,38,2  years15mg 1X D,5/1/2013Email,Citalopram hydrobromide
9, 4, ,never had problems with citalopram_ but all of a sudden rashes formed under my breasts and on my abdomen.  I thought it was the medication so I stopped taking it..  Then I started vomiting all week.  I must have a bug.  But could this be a withdrawal symptom_ not sure yet.  Not taking anything right now.,,F,60,14  months20 mg 1X D,12/9/2012,Citalopram hydrobromide
10, 3, Depression,No side effects except that after about 3 months or so_ it stopped working for me and I felt as depressed as I did before.,No side effects. Started it around late November. Started on 10 mg_ increased to 20 after a month and shortly after 40. By mid December to late Dec. I felt amazing- positive_ sexual_ full of ideas_ expressive_ outgoing_ everything I missed. By late March it had worn off/stopped working and I have yet to find something else that improves me the way this medication did. I just hate that the effects were so short lived.,F,22,4  months40mg 1X D,6/20/2012Email,Citalopram hydrobromide
11, 5, clinical depression,As long as I take my medication citalopram and wellbrutin I'm better_ anyone in clinical depression has good and bad days_ as long as I'm on the medicine I can half way function.,I take citopram in addition to Wellbruton.  This is my 4th bout with depression.  This was triggered 2 1/2 years ago when we found out that my husband had bile duct cancer.  Then 6 months later he was gone_ I had been his caregiver for 22 years.  Then my Mom left me 9 months later.,F,59,2  years60 1X D,5/16/2012Email,Citalopram hydrobromide
12, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ & OCD,Nausea for the first 24 hours of first dose but none after that. Sweatiness and would easily overheat for the first month. Hiccups for the first week. Yawning during the first 2 weeks. Worsened anxiety in the mornings for the first month. Itchy hives broke out on my legs the first month I used this but then they went away (not sure if this was due to the drug or something else).  After the first month_ the only side effects that stayed were jaw-clenching (Bruxism - worst in evenings/early mornings)_ dilated pupils (highly sensitive to bright lights)_ and delayed orgasm.,Citalprolam/Celexa did help me feel happier. My OCD calmed down quite a bit. I still had mild anxiety but that's a lot better than the severe anxiety I had before I started Celexa. I don't know if the drug had anything to do with it_ but I used to dress like a frump but when I was on the drug I was a fashionista and got compliments on my clothing and hair frequently. I guess when you're feeling happier_ you have motivation to do more things. I weaned myself off of this drug because I thought I didn't need it anymore and now I am back to my depressed/anxious self and dress like a frump again and I just don't care. I'm debating whether to get back on this drug because I also want to get pregnant but I fear it will harm the baby's development. If I were not wanting pregnancy right now I would get back on this drug in a heartbeat.,F,25,4  months20 MG 1X D,3/15/2012Email,Citalopram hydrobromide
13, 4, anxiety/depression,some insomnia_ extremely difficult to reach orgasm/ejaculation.,I have tried a number of anti-depressants for the last 4 years. This one works well for me_ but for the sexual side effect. That is not too much a big deal at this time_ as my wife is on both arimidex_ and cymbalta_ for cancer treatment_ ans has no desire for sex whatsoever. Should the day come when she is off those meds_ I may have to switch meds_ or drop them altogether.,M,56,8  months40mg 1X D,9/13/2011Email,Citalopram hydrobromide
14, 4, hypothyroidism/muscle aches,"If I take in the morning_ I feel it ""kick in.""  Get a little cloudy for about a half hr then fine.  I prefer to take it at night so I don't feel that way.",After a fews days noticed I didn't get as upset about symptoms I was having related to my hypothyroidism.  Not sure if it helped with the muscles aches I was experiencing_ but I do notice an improvement.  I think it just depends on the person whether you should take it at night or in the morning due to whether you experience fatigue or insomnia.,F,24, 10 mg 1X D,8/27/2011Email,Citalopram hydrobromide
15, 2, Bipolar II_ BPD_ anxiety,Dizziness_ foggy brained feeling_ shaking_ clenched jaw_ increased anxiety_ weight gain_ inability to sit still_ feeling disconnected_ eventual worsening of depression.,It worsened racing thoughts_ suicidal ideas and agitation from the bipolar. I felt on this drug I had a constant feeling of emptiness and apathy too.,F,19,6  weeks40MG 1X D,8/8/2011Email,Citalopram hydrobromide
16, 5, Anxiety,vivid dreams,I am very happy with the citalopram.  I used to be have severely bad anxiety and it caused problems in my relationship.  It took about a week for the initial side affects to go away so I do recommend that someone just starting to give this a chance.Unlike some others_ I don't have a decrease in sex drive_ nor am I tired all the time.  For me_ this is a miracle drug.  I smile more_ but still get upset and anxious at appropriate times.  I didn't loose feelings at all_ just the irrational anxiety.I can walk into a restaurant alone and be alright_ whereas before_ I wouldn't ever.  I can go to places I've never been before.Citalopram has opened up my life.,F,31,3  years60mg 1X D,5/8/2011,Citalopram hydrobromide

20, 1, depression,I experienced extreme homicidal rage within 45 minutes of taking 1/2 of a 20mg pill.,I don't see how this could be beneficial to anyone.  I was taking Dr. Reddy's brand of generic Celexa.,M,28,1  days10mg 1X D,12/5/2010,Citalopram hydrobromide
