0, 3, must take with vivelle dot/estrogen,Drowsy_ some general feelings of weakness_ lower back pain_ mild uterine cramps without menstruation_ increased hot flashes.,"Reading the comments here_ it sounds like I just stumbled into an emergency room in a war zone. I would remind readers that these reviews do not take into consideration any other ailments_ disorders or medications - from these ""reviews"" I have no idea what progesterone is really actually doing or not doing to everyone else; just wanted to share my experience.",F,51,2  weeks200 3X W,7/9/2016,Progesterone
1, 1, Hvy painful period& tubular breasts,Extreme sudden hair loss on top of head! Can't sleep at all during luteal phase of menstrual cycle when I never had a bad night's sleep in my life! Racing heart! Highly irritable! Extreme anxiety with panic attacks and nervous hand tremors!,"I have heard of this ""helping"" some women.  (But it also will shut down your body's own natural production of it with prolonged use) It made my periods worse (how was that even freaking possible?!) I still can't sleep almost a year later. All I do is research how to fix this and my husband can't stand how obsessed I am. I hate doctors that don't truly want to help people. The choice is yours if u decide to take this_ but beware of this so-called natural_ bio-identical hormone from hades!",F,30,3  months40 mg 2X D,6/17/2016,Progesterone
2, 1, Pms_ mood swing,First I was given a bhrt pill from the PA that treated me. It was 50mg of progesterone_ 25mg testosterone_ 5mg of DHEA. After 6  weeks she went up on the dosage. I felt horrible and fat!  I was going about 8 weeks until I had a period_ but cramping and bloating and emotional. After testing my hormones again_ she changed me to a cream. My progesterone had dropped and estergen skyrocketed past 650.  I'm still having problems with the cream. Had a period two weeks apart. I called the PA today and she basically told me she wasn't sure what to do with me. I'm wearing myself off the hormones. I'm going to continue to take armour thyroid 90mg. This has been a very expensive_ horrible experience.,Progesterone made me feel horrible. I was bloated_ gained weight_ more tired_ emotional and depressed.,F,39,6  months50mg cream,6/16/2016Email,Progesterone
3, 1, Pre-Menopause,"After having night sweats_ mood swings_ lack of libido_ etc it was determined I would benefit from hormone therapy.  Estradial hormone patch .025MG and Progesterone (Cylic) 12 days of cycle.  At first it seemed to help.  However_ my mood swings are now much worse_ depression has been much worse (I take an antidepressant and have increased that).  I don't feel like me_ I'm tired_ can't focus_ I'm not motivated_ I have extreme swings in emotion and have rage with irritation. Concerned I went back to doctor to see what they could do.  They basically ran bloodwork and said my estrogen was in the ""Normal"" level...so I don't need to increase my estrogen.  I started researching the Progesterone and I now believe it is the culprit.  I have decided to stop the Estrogen and Progesterone and try some more natural remedies because at this rate it is NOT worth it.",,F,51,8  months100MG 1X D,6/13/2016Email,Progesterone
4, 1, endometriosis,extreme breast tenderness and swelling_ depression_ severe weight gain_ fatigue_ bloating_ severe mood swings_ joint pain_ heavy and very painful periods,This cream ruined my body. I read how using it can greatly help people suffering with endometriosis pain.I was so optimisitc and gladly dished out hundreds of dollars and kept telling myself those were all just temporary side effects. I hate my body more than ever right now_ as I gained 14+ pounds in the time I used the cream. I eat a very clean and balanced diet_ and excercise like a fiend. this has ruined my self esteem_ as well as my sex life with my partner. I have fat deposits all over my body that were never ever there before. seeing myself naked is shocking_ as I have an entirely different body now thanks to this horrible cream. My mood was so doom and gloom that i actually thought about breaking up with my boyfriend and being alone. It makes you mentally sick.

I didn't realize it at the time but it made my hair fall out and my sleep issues worse.  So I went to the doctor and she told me it was prob not enough and wrote me an rx.  My symptoms got even worse.  Just stay away.  Do not take it!!!  I have been off of progesterone for 7 months now and am slowly getting better.

7, 1, Tested low / estrogen dominance,Severe panic attacks_ heart palpitations_ shortness of breath_ sensations of anxiety/unease_ crying spells_ dizziness_ acne_ sweating_ fatigue.,Thank you all for taking time to post your experiences with this drug. I wish I would have read this sooner.  I was prescribed  progesterone cream_ adrenal support superman and thyroid medication.  I am highly sensitive to medication so I took only half of the dose for 21 days. I actually felt okay until week 3 when out of nowhere I had a panic attack at work.  Since then I have an ongoing feeling of unease and anxiety that changes to extreme sadness throughout the day. It is very difficult to concentrate. I do not have a history of panic attacks and have never contemplated suicide until this all started. Thank goodness I found this website because I thought I was going crazy.  I actually started psychotherapy 2 weeks ago because I did not know what was going on. I stopped taking this 5 days ago. I feel a little better but still have anxiety and a general feeling of unease.   I would love to know how long it took others to completely heal from this.,F,35,3  weeks40mg,5/8/2016Email,Progesterone
8, 1, ,SWELLING_ INSANE fatigue_ stomach pain_ nausea_ disturbing clots passed during period_ the horrible depression.,What is wrong with Drs.?! I slept for 6 DAYS round the clock_ I thought I had a flu...then the crying started_ and shaking hands_ paranoia_ extreme sadness...and I BRIKE UP WITH MY BOYFRIEND_ who I love dearly...(he held on tight_ thank you Lord)...I thought this was me as well_ I pushing suicidal thoughts away all weekend. I read this_ that's it. No more for me. I tried to tell my GYN that I progesterone (Promeitrium) does NOTHING good for my hormonal swings. She dismissed me and said I don't think you have taken this before: but I HAD. At age 30_ compounded at first then the brand. SAME EXACT REACTIONS. Honestly_ the pill_ with a balance of hormones_ may be synthetic_ but I'd rather risk the side effects then to risk suicidal and psychotic behavior. SHAME on the MD's who say 'Oh_ it can't be what I prescribed_ I've never seen a reaction like that before.' REALLY!!!!??? You are clearly not in research for a reason. Nice to meet you. I told her! I told her. Take such good care of yourselves my girls out there. Thanks for reality check. You all probably saved a life tonight.,F,48,1  weeks100mg,5/2/2016,Progesterone
9, 3, Fatigue_ovarian cysts_fibro.breasts,Rash_ dizziness ONLY when pharmacy changed brand to Akorn generic (round dark pink pill with an AK on it). I had no reaction to the round peach pill with SV on it taken prior_ Solvay now AbbVie. (While I had a partial hysterectomy about 10 years ago_ I still have my ovaries and am still ovulating_ but have significant hormone imbalance- extreme fatigue_ inability to recover from exercise_ developed ovarian cysts_ dense fibrocystic breast tissue. The SV brand helped somewhat with these symptoms.),Ask what brand the pharmacy carries! Even generics differ from one another. From reading about the differences_ progesterone capsules from different companies vary in purity. (Sometimes it's the fillers or dyes that differ.) I read that many people experience reactions to Teva generic brand as well.,F,46,8  months100 mg,4/10/2016Email,Progesterone
10, 1, Premenopause,My doctor told me the bioidentical compound was going to fix all the concerns I was having from my migraines to sex drive. Well_ I'm glad I found this site because I thought I was going crazy.. between the anger issues to not having the energy (strenght maybe a better word ) to move. I have always been active_ yes had days my body just didn't want to cooperate but never to this extent. I feel like I have cement running through my veins... prior to starting the bioidentical progesterone I had registered for several races and now I can barely make it up my stairs. I actually thought I had ms_ but I'm going g to stop taking the progesterone to see if that helps. I read the one woman's comment about being so angry she wanted to leave her husband_  kick her kids out of the house etc. This week I missed work due to having a major break down.

I woke up feeling sick and VERY nervous. That quickly turned into a full blown panic attack and I felt like I was losing my mind. I was shaking_ sick to my stomach_ everything seems surreal and weird. My face felt numb and tingly and my head started to hurt. I called my Dr. right away. She said to take the progesterone maybe every 3rd day instead_ at night and also to half my already tiny dose .5mg of estrogen. I agreed to try that by immediately decided to never_ ever take that pill again! I have sent her a note requesting to try a cream instead and that way I can better monitor how much I am getting. I don't even want to try that to be honest because now I am terrified of ever feeling like that again. I'm happy for the gals who don't get bad side-effects from this horrid drug but I am warning you other who are thinking of trying it....these posts are NOT overreactions!

I feel less bloated_ thinking more clearly and just feel MUCH better than I have in a long time. I even have more energy. I am going to start taking it at night though and try to avoid those wonky feelings after first taking my dose. This is only day 8 so who knows what lays ahead.

46, 3, Estrogen Dominance,Dry eyes_ anxiety_ hypoglycemia_ uncontrollable shaking_ brain fog_ panic attacks_ feelings of unreality,I took both compounded topical progesterone and Pro Gest creams under the guidance of a doctor.  I was initially prescribed the progesterone for estrogen dominance symptoms (extreme anxiety) and it worked WONDERFULLY......for 5 months.  I felt normal.  Then my symptoms reverted back and they got progressively worse.....anxiety every day instead of just the week before my periods.  Looking back now_ I should have either stopped using it or at least cut down on the frequency and dose but my doctor actually told me to use more.  So here I am now...with 15x more in my saliva than I should have.  I stopped cold turkey and am in Day 7 of my detox.  The symptoms are still really bad if not worse than before.  Am seeing a different doctor to find out how to get this out of my system.  Please use with caution and listen to your body....most doctors do not understand how to use this stuff.  Just because you can get it in a health food store does not make it safe.  And all the glowing reviews on line ....haven't we read all of those??

Then a doctor decided that I needed to take a small 25mg of progesterone for 6 weeks.  I didn't make it two.  All the side effects listed are from that little 25mg. daily.

50, 1, Perimenopause_ hot flashes,What a mistake!  I had been experiencing unpleasant night sweats due to perimenopause and my MD gave me some literature on ways to reduce its symptoms.  So I bought Progest cream at a health food store.,I used the product as directed.  The first 3 days_ no side effects and no night sweats.  After that_ extreme lethargy_ sleepiness_ depression_ anxiety_ nausea and heartburn set in_ to be followed by the shakes_ uncontrollable thoughts_ fears_ nightmares .... it was horrid. I stopped on the 11th day_ experienced the above symptoms for about 2 more days_ and now  a total of 5 days has passed_ and I'm only 50% back to normal.  I am improving daily_ but I suspect it will take a few more weeks or a month.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  There is a reason why we experience menopause and its symptoms_ we should not interfere with how the body is supposed to work.  I would never recommend progesterone or any other HRT.

51, 1, Tested Low,I used a compounded progesterone cream.  Anxiety_ heart palpitations_ cystic acne_ hair shedding_ insomnia_ weird carpal tunnel feelings in both arms that fluctuates. Pins and needles feeling in arms fingers_ ravenous hunger. Extremely loose joints.,Soooo... do not use this drug. It is dangerous! It worked great for 3 weeks_ but is has caused more problems. If you used progesterone cream (like on your arms) then you suddenly develop weird sensations in your arms weeks later. Don't be alarmed. It is the toxic overload from the cream in your body! Drink rose petal tea and do some juicing to get the toxins out. This has been helpful. Also think about taking a liquid iron supplement if you are still having periods.  Also try Vitex (herb) to raise your progesterone. Its gentle and has GREATLY helped with my anxiety. Thank you Jesus!!! The Lord gave me a dream to take vitex.. it takes time but is helping. I'm sleeping more. Also think about low doses of B6_ vitamin C_ and Curcumin if you are having acne. All these things have helped me.. and I can tell my progesterone has started come up on its own with the help of these supplements after being off this cream for a month. This drug has been HORRIBLE and others need to know the side effects... there are many! I wish I would read up before I took it. I hope this post will help anyone struggling with the same issues.

53, 1, Estrogen Dominance,I was having a lot of anxiety and insomnia along with some depression_ and irregular periods.  After saliva testing_ I was told by my naturopath that I am estrogen dominant_ and the solution was to take this bioidentical (derived from wild yams) progesterone lozenge 2 x day for the last two weeks of my cycle.  I lasted only 6 days on this stuff.  I will say that during the first few days_ my anxiety felt much better.  However_ on the third day I started getting night sweats_ my sleep worsened_ and on the 6th day I began spotting.  I then got my period a week early_ and stopped taking the progesterone as I was told to do if I got my period.  The next day I had vertigo.  I was quite depressed for a few days_ it was awful.  My depression got a bit better as time went on over the next week.  I was told to take it again in my next cycle after I saw signs of ovulation_ so I did.  After just 1 dose_ I felt instantly more anxious_ my mind was racing and I just felt not right.  A few hours late,I do feel that you need to listen to your body.  Do not believe them when they tell you that you need to give it at least 3 cycles to level out.  While that may be true for some_ our hormones are always changing.  You truly need to get tested often_ keep a journal_ and track everything to find out your dose and when you should be taking it.

It was a constant balancing act. This past 1-1/2 year have been on mini-velle est patch from .0375 to .075 now.05. with 50 mg of oral compounded progesterone at bedtime. I used to be very active and now because of the constant fatique_ faint feelings and extreme tiredness I am less active. I have suspected the progesterone might be causing the faint feeling. This week I am  trying taking 50 mg every other day. So far_ the days I don't take progesterone I don't have the strong faint feeling and heavy head when standing so it looks like my body and my brain does not like progesterone. But doc says must take both together. So guess I will have to stop the est patch as well. I went off for a year in 2012 and only had hot flashes_ manageable_ but new endo doc put me back on hrt and insisted I would be better but it has been a hell year. I am hypothyroid as well and when I started back on hrt my thyroid TSH went high_ more hypo_ more symptoms. I continued to need increases of synthroid from 125mcg now up to 150mcg plus a couple days of 175mcg. Its been a terrible year and I regret going back to hrt.

I hadn't changed anything else and I couldn't understand why I had gotten so depressed again. I was still in anti-depressant and had been doing well. About a week after I started pro I started crying_ could hardly get out of bed and feeling very depressed again. I started eating a lot and craved many foods and started gaining weight. I began having crippling anxiety: I couldn't function at work and felt like I was having a panic attack (never had one before). I was sleeping better at night but began feeling very sleepy and falling asleep at odd times-at my desk_ too sleepy to get out of my car to go in the grocery store without a nap_ right there in my car!

I feel very depressed and weepy_ my stomach hurts and I feel tired_ out of it and crabby.  I know they say to give it a chance but I don't think I can handle another week of the stomach issues and depression.,I was prescribed natural progesterone cream from my Doctor after blood work. The dose was 30mg. The first time I tried it I could not sleep and felt restless and strange. Half a dose did the same thing. I recently tried it again after experiencing several days of very bad headaches due to hormonal fluctuations - at a quarter of the prescribed dose. I know this works for some women_ it just doesn't work for me. If my symptoms increase I may try it again. It might not be the right time for me.

I only started the added Progesterone capsules at night 4 months ago because I was having insomnia so this was added to the mix. Up until that point I had NO problems with my hormones_ and had great libido_ energy_ etc. Within the last 2 weeks all of side effects that I mentioned started happening rapidly_ couldn't for the life of me figure out what was going on_ and I had just had my thyroid hormones checked which were all normal. I then found this site and wow all the same side effects except I have yet to see anyone else with the loss of libido. Upon finding this site I decided to quit taking the extra Progesterone and I will see what happens the next few days.

When I turned 52 I noticed increase in bust size from D-DDD (estradiol imbalance) and about 7 pounds over all. Sleeplessness was always an issue. The saliva test came back with a thorough chart of my hormone levels. They added compounded 50 mg progesterone that I take at night and .5 estradiol (skipping weekends) with 1 mg sublingqual testosterone and 25 mg DHEA in the morning. I feel more rested_ definitely more balanced and I'm hoping the addition of the testosterone will bring my weight back down. I've always been very physically active with distance running (up to 50 miles) and hiking so there is no reason for my breasts getting so huge or suddenly putting on padding after being the same for over 30 years.

Progesterone is a natural hormone that can be increased by taking natural suppliments that will not cause cancer! It comes from fruits and vegetables and maintaining healthy diet goes a long way. But_ if you are anything like me_ you might need a suppliment - my body just isn't making enough. Anyway...I began taking ProgonB about a month ago. I did a month long saliva test (twice) & the test determined that I am estrogen dominant_ and that I'm in the beginning states of menopause.

Some symptoms I still have are hot flashes_ nausea_ and my heart is still beating rapidly &/or pounding - but it's improved. I'll be seeing a cardiologist just to rule out anything major.

I take it in a cream form at night with estrogen cream_ that I rub on my forearems. I have had MASSIVE bouts of heartburn_ to the point that I feel like im having a heart attack.

I found that rubbing the cream onto the painful areas really helped a lot! Unfortunately_ it seemed like this small dose caused water retention and made me feel really fat.,I found a website that talks all about using progesterone cream. They explained that using too little is what causes the water retention and other estrogen dominance symptoms. They recommended using at least 100 mg per day. Since my doc had prescribed 150 mg of oral progesterone (that I had not yet started taking)_ I figured that dose should be OK. I tried it and my muscles feel NORMAL for the first time in years! When the pain starts to come back_ I just put a little more cream on the painful area.

92, 5, menopausal,I was perimenopausal at 38.  Also_ my hormones were never right after the birth of each child .  Symptoms were terrible; doubling-over ovarian pain during ovulation and beyond_ hot flashes every 15 mins_ no libido and eczema all over my arms & legs.  First tried the creams which just didn't work for me.  Too up and down with symptoms.  Also_ it was difficult to keep to a regular schedule with the applications.  Finally I came across a place that did bio-identical hormones that are inserted into you every 4-6 months.  It is essential to have a blood test before insertion to check your female hormone panel: Estradiol_ Testosterone and FSH.  Doesn't help too much to check your progesterone through blood testing as it varies so much during the month.  Found out my levels were alarmingly low.  The estrodial & testosterone are the pellets that are inserted in your backside_ with a local first (no kidding!) and the progesterone is taken orally. They don't have a pellet for that_ yet.,The beauty of the pellets is that they dissolve over 4-6 months and if you are more active a certain time of day (greater blood flow)_ more of the pellets dissolve into your system.  I am very athletic with a high metabolism_ hence I have to get the pellets every 5 months.  The first few years_ it was every 4 months.  My life has totally changed for the better.  If you do this_ make sure to keep copies of your blood test and chart your progress.  Take charge of your health and help let the Dr. know what you need.As for periods_ you don't have any if you take the progesterone continuously.  Btw_ I was doing that long before it became popular in Western medicine. I only stop the progesterone if I find my uterine lining starts to build up. Probably about every 6 months. Then restart when my period is completely done.,F,50,6  years200mg 1X D,11/7/2012Email,Progesterone
93, 2, PMS_ mood swings_ migraines,depression_ lethargy_ heavy bleeding in combination with testosterone,I used a blend of bioidentical progesterone and testosterone for two months.  At first I felt great on these hormones...energy improved_ helped relieve depression and migraines_ and I felt I had my life back!  The problems began when my second period started while on the hormones.  My period was normal but I had unusual depression starting on day 2-3 of my cycle.  I felt weird all over!  The depression finally eased somewhat and my period ended normally...however_ started a second period the day after the first one ended...VERY heavy and I don't ever have heavy periods.  At this point in perimenopause I have not had any bleeding like this.  I continued to bleed heavy for 3 days as I got off the hormone blend (I felt it was causing the heavy bleeding so decided to discontinue).  The whole episode was very terrifying!  I was weak and had flu like symtoms.  I decided to continue with just progesterone by itself to counteract any estrogen dominance.  Experiencing unusual depression_ lethargy_ dizziness_ and sleepiness.  I will lower the dose to see what happens.  If it continues will discontinue altogether. I would caution those wanting to use bioidentical hormones to proceed carefully.  I used them as a last resort and although it was good at first it came back to bite me.  Progesterone in excess can cause depression/lethargy because it down regulates available serotonin in the brain.

I couldn't focus and found myself zoning out.  Within 3 days I had developed extreme anger bordering on rage (I am usually very calm).  I also developed a severe depression_ which I have never had in my life.  I would cry for 30-40 minutes at a time and started to feel like it wasn't worth going on.  I've always had a perfect memory and I was forgetting a lot of things.  My skin also broke out.  My husband was very concerned about my personality shift and asked me to stop the cream.  About 36 hours after stopping my mood returned to normal.  It took another 2-3 days for the drowsiness to lift.

129, 1, Progesterone Low,For years I saw a herbalist who gave me Wild Yam and other herbs because since I was 16 years old I had had a hard time having a period. I believe that these made me very fertile and kept me regular for 12 YEARS. I NEVER had any of the side effects that I suffer now on PROGESTERONE & TESTOSTERONE CREAMS!Unfortunately my herbalist passed away and I went to an MD who_ I thought_ believed in natural remedies. I was afraid I could not be regular without herbs and she had my hormones tested and my progesterone & testosterone were low. Therefore_ she prescribed me the creams made especially for me by my pharmacist (at a cost of $100 to me!). (My dosage for Testosterone cream: 1 mg/1xday). After 5 weeks of applying them I feel MOODY_ ANXIOUS_ EASILY ANGERED_ and suffer a NERVOUS STOMACH or feeling like I have KNOTS IN MY STOMACH ALL DAY LONG.,The doctor directed me to stop applying the creams. Now_ I have endured 10 days of the anxiety_ knots in my stomach_ and nausea. I live on gingerale.

I had saliva testing done a month or so ago that showed estrogen dominance.  So_ I at first tried the Progesterone capsules 100 mg a day at bedtime.  This did not help with my insomnia_ so we changed it to a compounded progesterone/melatonin lozenge.  I was fine for the first 2 weeks and slept like I hadn't slept in years.  I was also found to have almost NO AM cortisol_ so when I wasn't better in a couple of weeks_ I was started on cortef.  I saw my doctor this afternoon.  She knew immediately what was wrong.  She told me that no amount of Celexa or cortef could over ride the affect of progesterone overdose.  I am stopping all of the adrenal support supplements and progesterone effective today.  I will remain on the cortef_ celexa and westhroid (for thyroid).  We are hoping that since I was taking this orally_ that it will get out of my system quickly.  I may or may not go back on progesterone.  IF I do go back on it_ it will be a much smaller dose.  Be careful with this one.  It is a VERY POWERFUL medication and should not be taken lightly.

131, 1, Low progesterone test results,"ALL 'BIO IDENTICAL' PROGESTERONE IS POISON.  When someone tells you_ ""...it is natural because it is made from a yam!""  Don't listen.  Heroin and cocaine are also natural.  If a chemist must chemically change the yam to create progesterone that is NOT NATURAL.  Taking progesterone (as opposed to what your body makes- THAT is natural) is a lethal course of action.  IF YOU HAVE BEEN POISONED by this scam_ CALL THE FDA and report what has happened to you.  I assure you; just because you got this from a ""well-meaning naturpath"" do NOT think the naturpathic community is not littered with egotistical quacks just like conventional medicine.",So NOW WHAT DO YOU DO???1.  You must allow time to take its course and allow this poison to get out of your body.  It may take up to 2 years. 2.  Do NOT take other pharmaceuticals to rid yourself of the symptoms-- YOU WILL EVENTUALLY GET WORSE.  Prozac and Xanax are your ENEMIES.3.  Your symptoms are most likely from systemic candida as a result of having been poisoned from the progesterone; eat meat_ veggies_ and low glygemic fruits.  Avoid foods high in oxalic acid.4.  You WILL HEAL.  It takes TIME.5.  The reason you needed to take the progesterone in the first place was NOT due to menopause; you have done something in your diet or lifestyle to drain your adrenals.  Fix THIS.

I recommend it if you are estrogen-dominant and want to feel more like yourself again. Note - once by mistake I rubbed the Progesterall cream all over me after a bath_ mistaking it for moisturizing lotion in the dim light - I immediately felt hot all over and jumped back in the tub to rinse it off! Felt fine after that. The important thing here is - you must use only a TINY drop.

I take bioidentical hormones (25mg Progesterone and DHEA combo plus extra 25mg of Progesterone 14 days before my period to prevent PMS symptoms) - natural_ safe. Don't take synthetic progestins!,The bioidentical hormones have SAVED MY LIFE. I experienced Estrogen Dominance since I was 18. It got worse after a lot of stress_ when I got Adrenal Fatigue and Western Medicine had no clue what to do_ even a Stanford Gyno. They kept trying to give me antidepressants and birth control pills_ which just made me a TON worse! It took some tweaking and of course_ it takes at least 3 cycles to settle_ but now_ I have NO depression or carb cravings at all! I get a little irritable still before my period_ but that I can live with. *I should also note that the Adrenal Fatigue was treated wonderfully too by the Alternative Med doctor (licensed doctors better than PA's etc. IMHO) on supplements that cured my insomnia and thyroid med's (T3 was low but T4_ TSH okay).,F,43,1  years25-50 mg 1X D,3/7/2011,Progesterone

The OBYGY mentioned that the cysts would resolve once I went through menopause - linking the cysts to hormone levels.  I asked that my hormone levels be checked and was given a blood test and told that I was not in menopause yet.  I asked if I could have my progesterone and estrogen levels checked_ and was told by OBGYN and GP doc that there was not a blood test for that - I was not offered a saliva test and at the time did not know that's how specific hormone levels could be checked. So my OBGYN prescribed 30mg of a compound progesterone - not knowing my exact hormone levels. I have been applying a progeterone cream daily for 6 months - the last 6 weeks I have experienced ocassional severe headaches and almost daily dull headaches.  I also have broken out with acne around my laugh lines and chin_ and have been having fibromyagia like symptoms of joint pain and fatigue.  As a result of the symptoms_ I have had a brain scan for the headaches_ saw a neurologist for the headaches and was told I have ""Chronic Tension"" headaches - He prescribed amitriptyline (have not taken it yet). I saw a Dermatologist for the acne and was put on an antibiotic for 3 wks.  The medical costs of these tests and MD appointments are huge.

Not only did I get 4 migraines (4 days in a row) but I started having crazy anxiety & heart palpitations that landed me at the local Urgent Care.

I'm so glad to see all of your posts here indicating that I am indeed correct_ but I'm really disappointed that obviously my Dr. doesn't really know the side effects of these meds.  I've been off for 9 days now_ the symptoms are definitely fading... but some days are worse than others.  I fully expected to be feeling myself again by now (migraines or not) but I am still slightly plagued by a feeling of unease... and my heart races every now and again for unspecified periods of time.  I'm just praying that this stuff gets out sooner than later_ I'm starting to think maybe I have issues & it wasn't the meds.

No desire_ no energy; my hair was falling out; anxiety/depression; brain fog.  After a little research_ these were all symptoms of estrogen dominance.  I had previously had blood work done and my hormones (or lack thereof) were a mess.  I decided to give this a try before going back to the dr.  Now_ I feel so much better.  I take it in 12 hour intervals--1/8-1/4 tsp.  While each individual woman may need more or less according to her own body_ it isn't fair to bash this hormone if you've only taken it a few days.  All medications have side effects.  Most side effects will disappear after a short while--my dull headaches are gone (my only side effect).  To write something so negative without giving it a few months is not fair to all of the woman looking for relief who might be swayed with those of you who haven't given it a real shot.  I highly recommend this product and give it a couple of months before drawing conclusions.  Good luck!!!,F,50,2  weeks 2X D,7/22/2010Email,Progesterone

I took it for 2 weeks and my breasts became painful_ back ache_ hemorrhoids_ headaches_ water weight_ UTI....all the things you get when you are pregnant (because it is the prenancy hormone).  I felt horrible.   It then goes away after my cycle but has returned each month for the past 4 months each time my cycle is due.

The first two weeks were fine_ then I started having the worst hot flashes_ I have never had them before_ it was terrible. I also have fibromyalgia so any little change in medications sleep patterns really upsets me and puts me into a major spin! Then I couldn't sleep. I was taking 1/4 tsp of 6%_ so they told me to increase it a bit_ I started getting dizzy when driving_ gaining weight_ 2-3 lbs. at first_ irritable_ freezing cold.

I also can't pee and when I do there is a  bit of blood on the tissue.  I can't get anything accomplished because I can't concentrate.   My feet were so swollen I couldn't even see my ankles and my hands are still swollen so that I can't get my wedding rings off and can't wear any of my other rings.

Have had these symptoms for 3 days_ beginning at onset of use of proges this month. But breast tenderness has gone_ am sleeping great_ moods are better. Have not gained any weight but am bloated right now with cramping.,I'm a clinical exercise physiologist working in women's health. I believe that many symptoms listed on this forum are the result of the initial effects of progesterone up-regulating estrogen receptors. When we are estrogen dominant_ are exposed to too many xenoestrogens in the environment/food_ or are overweight_ our estrogen receptors lose their sensitivity.The first thing that should happen with progesterone is to retune up estrogen receptors making them more sensitive_ and so symptoms of excess estrogen get worse in the first couple of months of progesterone use. Also_ many recommended doses are too much; even often Dr. Lee's recommendations. Other docs like Mercola [mercola.com] and WomenToWomen use much less. I'm down to 1/16 tsp 1xday. And oral progesterones are really problematic bc you can't control how much gets into the blood [liver breaks down]. Blood tests are not reliable indicators of free progest._ so if you're having questions about levels_ get a saliva test. And I just learned today about the problem of progest. creams containing parabens and cramping symptoms. Parabens are powerful xenoestrogens and make estrogen symptoms worse. My cream has them [KAL]. Will be changing to today.,F,56,2  months,12/16/2009Email,Progesterone

My personal opinion with progesterone is that we are all different...some women have tremendous success.  I didnt_ but i wouldnt throw baby out with the bathwater. I believe some of you are experiencing problems because when you start progesterone it ""wakes up"" your estrogen receptors.

I actually have a thyroid problem and probably that was causing my former minor symptoms_ but several different doctors insisted that it was my female hormones because I am a certain age.   Well_ my female hormones sure DID get messed up on progesterone!  Yes_ I took bio-identical.  My right breast blew up and i got an egg-sized cyst in it with lots of fluid that got hardened and was painful.   I finally defied the doctor and looked it up if progesterone could cause cysts and I found this site.   I couldn't believe that so many people had so many symptoms similar to mine.  I noticed that one person on this site gave a link to Dr. Theresa Dale's site and I looked it up and I'm doing the lab tests she recommends and I'm going to do her protocol.   She gets people OFF hormone therapy (even bio-identical) and balances their bodies.   She uses things that are not hormones_ mostly homeopathic as far as I can tell_ and her products are FDA approved_ which means she had to provide hundreds and hundreds of before and after lab tests.   I'll come back to this site in another month or two and let everyone know how it's going.  I just stopped the progesterone cold turkey and nothing bad happened to me and some of the worst symptoms subsided or got less.

255, 5, perimenopause symptoms,"Overall improved quality of life!  Used the 2% cream from the health store for 2 years (my husband called it ""happy cream"") to alleviate PMS symptoms of breast tenderness_ anxiety_ headache_ bloating_ mood swings.  And over the last two years have been on capsule of progesterone with a small amount of DHEA from a compounding pharmacist. This improved my ability to sleep_ stopped the beginnings of hot flashes.  Really no negative side effects for me or the five friends of mine that are now some form of bio-identical progesterone","One important aspect of using bio-identical hormones is that as our bodies progress into menopause we must have bloodwork done on a regular basis to see if the dosage is appropriate or if other hormones are needed to maintain the improved quality of life.I am now on a small amount of estrogen cream because my hot flashes reappeared and because in the last few years my blood work indicated I went from estrogen dominant with low progesterone and almost no testosterone to 4 years later having acceptable progesterone and testosterone levels and almost none existent estrogen levels.  I read all of the comments and many of the negative comments use the same word phrases (i.e. ""my life a living hell"") and patterns which indicate to me this site has one person who has populated the comments repeatedly which for me will make me think twice about the credibility of the site relative to the frequency of comments.

256, 1, perimenopause,huge bloating and/or weight gain in midsection and_ especially_ lower abdominal area; breast tenderness (had never had this problem before)_ some minor itchiness where applied on wrist and inner arm area_ weepiness,I had been able to regulate my periods and lose most of associated cramping through lifestyle/diet change but still had some PMS swelling/bloating every month. I also have hypothyroidism. I decided to try the progesterone cream to see if either of these could also be eliminated.  I used all natural progesterone cream made by Source Naturals.  I only made it through day 7 of the first 14 days to be taken and stopped due to the incredible and unacceptable weight gain (5-6 inches in a week!  Unfreaking believable!)  Am really hopeful this is just a huge exacerbation of water retention that will go away now that I've ceased the progesterone.  Starting to believe Drs. Lee and Hadley's book (from which I learned about the supposed multi-health benefits of natural progesterone cream) is extremely irresponsible in its failure to explore/discuss the side effects and negative reactions...since many appear to be exactly opposite of why one would take natural progesterone.,F,48,7  days,9/25/2009,Progesterone

Blood tests and ultrasound appeared normal_ however my doc was concerned about a buildup of uterus lining after going so long without a period.  My doc suggested I try Pro-Gest cream to kick start a period.  The plan was 1/4 tsp. cream days 14-21_ and then increase to 1/2 tsp. cream for days 21-28_ then stop for a week.  Well I'm 10 days into this two week plan and am seriously suicidal.  My body aches_ feels swollen_ and I have absolutely no energy.  I feel like I've gained at least five pounds and my pants are tight.  I started crying this afternoon for no reason and feel so miserable and unhappy.  I don't even have the energy to exercise_ which only makes me feel guilty and even fatter.  I've canceled two social events because I feel anxious and angry and don't want to be around other people.  Even though I was supposed to continue with the Pro-Gest for 14 days I'm stopping right now.  I'd seriously rather have a D&C than live like this!!,F,40,10  days,9/18/2009,Progesterone
259, 4, estrogen dominant symptoms,general breast tenderness (not cysts_ just tenderness in areas),Started natural bio-identical progesterone cream 10/08_ starting each course in 2nd half of cycle (days 12-21 after first day of bleed.) Symptoms relieved:  irregular periods_ slight bloating_ sudden onset of cellulite_ fibrocystic breasts_ sleep disturbances. Noticably improved results in the gym_ as well (nice bonus.) Through July 09_ all was well.  Then breakthrough bleeding (perhaps period) while on July's course.  Finished the course and waited for August's period_ to begin again on day 12.  It didn't come. That month_ estrogen-dominant sypmtoms returned (cellulite_ sleep problems_ even cysts in breasts_ one of which has been sent to mammogram for dx.) Suspected low progesterone levels (not enough to trigger bleed.)  On Sept 9_ began pg course.  Sept 10_ bleed began.  Normal period continues_ and I'd normally stop course and wait for day 12 (ovulation) to cue next pg course_ but due to breast lump_ I've continued this course. After 4 days' course_ lump in breast is undetectable.  Will now stop course_ allow natural progression of cycle_ and update after mammogram tomorrow.,F,48,11  months,9/13/2009,Progesterone

It has made my life a living hell. I have been on it for 8 months now and i will NEVER touch it again. I 1st took 30mg and no improvement. They then increased me dose to 50mg_ then 75mg. I kept on telling my doctor that it doesnt work_ its making me worse. They kept on saying it will work we just need to increase the dose. While I was on it i was a different person and i could not see the effect it was having on me i went insane. I was a suicidal angry mess. I was violent towards myself and my partner.

I was burping with every swallow of food or beverage.  In March I began feeling like my head was heavy_ and dizzy with upset stomach. They found my potassium low and put me on a supplement. Within 2 weeks my potassium went up_ but my calcium was high. I called the pharmacy that provided my cream and ask if anything in it would cause dizziness or my potassium or calcium levels to change.  She advised no.  My urine began to change_ sometimes I would go a lot and other times I could not hardly go. My urine test showed high white blood cells but the culture came back with nothing. I went to another HRT pharmacy and showed them my prescription.  The pharmacist said she was adding 5mg daily of DHEA and that seemed like a lot.  He made me another month of cream with half 2.5 daily.  I took it for 3 days and wanted to go off the dhea completely.  I used the cream without DHEA for 4 days_ until my appointment with a OBGYN_ she said the progesterone would make me dizzy not the DHEA and to go off all of it immediately and that the DHEA would deplete my potassium.

282, 1, trying to fix underlying problems,"Had problems with progesterone_ and you don't know why? First_ look at why you would take progesterone in the first place: horrible periods? Horrible PMS? Horrible menopause? These are all SYMPTOMS of underlying problems. So trying to ""fix"" the underlying problems are like trying to buy a fan to rid yourself of the smoke_ and not buying the water that drowns the fire instead. For me_ I took progesterone after a doctor told me that my progesterone levels were too low. Failing to look at WHY my progesterone levels (at the age of 35) were low_ I was convinced that I should take the progesterone. I became very miserable. I could not drive. I could not think. I could not sleep. I could not eat many foods without feeling horrible. You see_ years ago_ I was drinking a lot of Starbucks-- the coffee_ and the green tea. Green Tea contains tons of fluoride_ and coffee contains many things that raise your cortisol levels. (Fluoride is very poisonous). So when you are under a lot of stres",Guess what? You are not supposed to have any progesterone bc you are DONE with having kids!  If you want to feel better_ HEAL your ADRENALS!So_ now what do you do??? First and foremost_ stop ALL of the hormones. Quit trying to outsmart mother nature by balancing this and that with taking thyroid_ estrogen_ progesterone_ TH3_ HGH.... stop everything! The best thing ever is JUICING. NOT pasteurized juice_ but juice your own organic LIVE juice. Juice things that are red_ green_ orange_ purple.... mix it up! You will feel like a human again in 8 months_ and in 18 months_ you will be healed. Learn the lesson_ and heed the warnings: don't take anymore hormones... BIO IDENTICAL HRT is a scam. Trust mother nature; not a chemist that makes money off of you_ and your pain.

I took it because my doctor assured me it would ""remove excess adrenaline"" from my system_ would help me lose weight_ relieve anxiety and depression_ would relieve PMS symptoms_ etc. Instead it made my life a living hell. Over 11 months I gained 40 lbs. What made it more dramatic was the fact that I gained all of that weight in the areas that I applied it (inner arms_ neck_ and inner thighs) leaving stretch marks on my inner arms. It did relieve the PMS symptoms which was great and I also felt relaxed in the beginning. Over time the relaxation turned to sleepiness which turned to chronic fatigue and finally lethargy. If I wasn't sleeping I was still too exhausted to move. I had no motivation and sank in to a deep depression. Towards the end I also stopped having periods altogether.

I'm on it for low progesterone levels and a slight estrogen dominance. I sleep very well at night_ and my periods are now becoming very regulated. My skin has cleared up a bit as well. My recommendation to women who are having problems with the cream is to make sure you are using a natural source in a glaxal base that is free from parabens. If you are estrogen dominant and are on this cream_ the first months are going to be hell_ but you have to stick through it. The progesterone cream helps your body detox from the estrogen overload_ and you MAY experience acne_ PMS_ weight gain_ etc. because of this. This doesn't last forever.

These should disappear in two weeks to three cycles but try reducing the dose of progesterone if you want immediate relief.  I take half a pea size per day of Pro-Gest cream and it is enough for me.  The main reason I started taking natural progesterone is to stop the growth of uterine fibroids.  I had to have a fibroid removed by surgery and I don't want it to grow back.   I don't know if the cream has any effect on fibroids yet this why I am not rating it as 5 but I do enjoy the other positive effects like sleeping better_ having lighter and longer periods and having less mood swings.

And yes_ no ovarian cysts.,I read that when a woman is perimenopausal_ her estrogen level starts to drop_ but not at the same rate or percentage as progesterone.  The effect then is that you may have lower estrogen_ but you are still estrogen dominant because of not enough progesterone to balance it out.  With my positive experiences_ I am a believer.  I was starting to retain fluid and I was gaining weight around my mid section_ that nothing worked to get rid of.  I've lost 12 pounds in 2 months without even trying.

Not sure what that means_ but I thought this cream was supposed to balance my moods_ not make them worse.,For people posting here_ IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY WHAT TYPE/BRAND OF PROGESTERONE YOU'RE USING. The synthetic forms prescribed by many doctors are known to cause horrible side effects_ whereas I've heard that the bioidentical form found in many OTC creams do not. Doctors can also prescribe bioidentical progesterone. Please help people further by listing what type/brand of progesterone you're using.

As soon as I started the cream for the second month the headache began. Four weeks later I still have it_ though it is starting to wear off now. I lost a lot of weight from nausea and vomiting_ and have had to take time off work. I stopped taking the cream at the end of month 2_ and really regret ever trying it.

For the last year I have been on Progesterone tablets (5 mgs) for a 21 day off and 10 day on cycle during the month. The idea was at the end of the 10 days on I would then have a period. This worked fine for the first 6 mos.(I just suffered through the side effects) then I began spotting during the 21 days off the meds. I was advised to increase the dosage of the Progesterone to 10 mgs. to stop the bleeding_ which worked. This last bout_ which has come 10 mos. into this regiment_ has been the worst.

No doctor mentioned progesterone cream. I felt improvement in my breasts after 24 hours of use.  By the end of a week_ my breasts were a 3 or 4 pain-wise and smaller in size due to reduced swelling.

I am taking progesterone with bi-estrogen (from yams) and testosterone. All are bio-identical hormones_ meaning their chemical structure is the same as the ones naturally produced by the body.  My research indicated that it is important to keep a balance of these hormones. Since I have not had my period for 17 months_  these hormones are at very low levels in my body. The symptoms I had before taking these hormones were: extreme joint and muscle pains_ painful intercourse_ forgetfulness_ low libido_ vaginal dryness_ no sexual arousal and capacity for orgasm_ insomnia due to the need to pee several times a night_ loss of concentration_ confusion_ hot flushes_ headaches_ unusual tiredness_ dry hair.  Within 1.5 days of taking the hormones_ the joint and body pain were reduced by 90%.  I was able to sleep through the night.  I can get arousal and orgasm again.  I am less confused.

Labs keep changing_ so at times my glucose is high_ at times my thryoid is high_ at times my cortisol is high - this mess all triggered by progesterone.  Drs have no idea why I continue to gain weight.  All they know is that when someone takes progesterone and isnt' short on progesterone in their body_ it can shut,I was told by a gynocological endocrinologist that those that are underweight_ low normal weight or obese have an 80% chance of gaining 20 lbs on progesterone.  If you are of normal weight_ you have a 20% chance of a 20 lb weight gain.  This was NOT told to me or I never would have taken it.  I was low body weight due to alot of training (that is why I lost my period).  If I would have just stopped training so hard and waited a bit longer_ my period would have come back.  Oh_ and to top it off_ the progesterone didn't start my period.  It came back on it's own 2 months later.  My life is a disaster and I am desperately unhappy.  Please don't take progesterone.  It has changed my life for the worse and nobody can give me a definite diagnosis or treatment to get me back to normal.  If anyone has also experienced this_ please contact me.

If you search for the article entitled_ ""Complications Regarding Progesterone Cream_"" it may prove to be of some help as it identifies significant issues related to natural progesterone cream usage.  In my case_ it has done so.  Unfortunately_ many physicians_ even well-meaning holistic ones_ simply do not know all of the intricacies involved in natural hormonal replacement.

383, 2, Estrogen Dominance-Adrenal Fatigue,Severe Depression_ Weepy_ Tired_ Unmotivated,I started taking a progesterone cream (pea size drop) twice daily after my saliva test showed estrogen dominance_ or low progesterone. The test also showed low levels of cortisol consistent with evolving adrenal gland fatigue.  My MD thoughts were that if I got my estrogen/progesterone levels in sync_ the adrenal gland would kick in.  After only four days on the progesterone I experience the worst depression! I felt like I wanted to wither up in some corner. I had no energy or motivation to do anything. I opted to get off the cream and try something else... do not know what yet....I never knew such depression could come on so sudden!,F,42,4  days,3/5/2007Email,Progesterone

My thyroid went down_ hair fell out_ depression (I had not been depressed before). Adrenal fatigue got worse then as my insomnia got worse to the point where I slept 2-3 hours only a night. Be very careful with balancing these hormones!!!!! I've nearly lost my job over it.,F,58,5  months,1/26/2007Email,Progesterone

Suffering from estrogen dom (serum & saliva testing)and no prog levels_ I started taking FEMGEST cream. Had taken PROGEST cream a couple of years ago but then stopped. I suffer on a semi-daily basis with all of at least the majority of the following: dizziness_ some vertigo_ muscle weakness_(primarily my thigh muscles) headache_ exhaustion_ coordination issues_ mental clarity issues_ some depressed thoughts (these are scary and come ""out of the blue"") severe anxiety_ fear_ phobic thoughts and panic.",I am on a rollercoaster and have no clear way to go at this point. The progesterone cream initially helped my anxiety (why I started it again in the first place) but about a month into the cream I started going down hill. Have been to the doc and had MRI's_ CT's_ a spinal tap_ bloodwork and the doc as of late acually even was thinking it could be MS but MRI showed no lesions. I am miserable and am thinking of weaning myself off of this cream to see if I feel better.

After many years I was found to have a pituitary tumour which caused the symptoms_ as I have had the tumour for many years these have got worse.  Unfortunately the side effect of provera have made things worse_ I did not realise that some of my problems were the provera.  I had an operation for the tumour which did not work out and have now been told I have to take a drug which also has side effects; I decided I would take nothing and came of the provera and now feel amazing.  The effect of the tumour will eventually cause serious problems but I don't care I don't want side effects which make me ill I would rather have a short life than be sick all of the time.,F,46,9  years,11/17/2006,Progesterone

434, 3, severe emotional PMS symptoms,The first month_ I couldn't believe how my emotional PMS symptoms had DISAPPEARED!  It messed up my period terribly though--it was 4 days late starting and then lasted TWELVE days with 4 days of heavy bleeding.  And this second month I'm finding that I'm irritable and have had several headaches and a little bloating already and I have more than two weeks to go until the next period.,I had what I felt were severe emotional PMS symptoms--irrational irritability with little things my 5 year old daughter did_ anger at other driver's,F,37,45  days,5/2/2005Email,Progesterone
435, 2, Premenopause symptoms_ no sex drive,Instant and extreme weight gain in abdomen. I gained almost 15 lbs in 3 weeks in my stomach area - no change in diet habits and I was going to the gym MORE. Also excessive (19-day) period with heavy bleeding.,I am still taking the progesterone cream_ at least until the end of this cycle. There doesn't seem to be anything I can do about the weight gain_ and my sex drive has not improved one bit. I am hoping that when I stop the cream at the beginning of my next period I will begin to get more normal. I don't know what to do about my sex drive_ though.,F,39,3  months,4/19/2005Email,Progesterone
436, 3, Natural  switched to  Liquid,Abdominal weight gain. Stomach_ abdomen_ hips and thighs. Do not stop cold. Makes everything worse.,I suffered severe PMS and the cream did help_ however over the years_ the symptoms have changed. I am no longer having such bad PMS but the most painful and intense perids and the excessive weight gain. I have no waist any longer.  I go to the gym and watch my diet_ but still the weight continues.  I am told it is from long term progesterone use.,F,48,4  years,3/13/2005,Progesterone
437, 3, Premenopause symptoms,Craving for sweets_ increased appetite_ puffiness in face and hands_ bloated abdomen and cramps_ weight gain in stomach and breasts. Always feel like I am going to start my period.,After reading John Lee's book I thought this was the answer. I am not so sure now this is what to take. I have used several different brands and one the pharmacist mixed up.I noticed I lost weight and was not having problems with cravings and depression while off of it for 1 month. Went back on it and noticed a weight gain right away in my stomach.It seems like I am hungry all the time when I use the cream and have sweet cravings as if I am having PMS type feelings. I have been off 2 weeks now and will see how it goes. I am wondering now if this has kept my weight from coming off????I have only had 2 periods in a year and feel crampy and like I am going to start all of the time. I am going to go off of this for a while and see how I do. It did relieve hot flashes. I take Calcium and Women in Balance Herbs from Herbal Healer Academy also. No more Progesterone Cream for me for now. I had regular periods until I was 50. I have used Progesterone cream for 2 years now off and on.,F,51,2  days,2/5/2005Email,Progesterone
438, 1, Induce period,I felt really relaxed at first (400mg of Prometrium for 10 days).  Soon_ my face had giant_ cystic acne and I swelled up.  The withdrawl sent my body into a severe depression.,After I stopped the drug_ I began to have uncontrollable anxiety_ heart racing_ nausea_ headache.  I called the dr. and o course they claimed that it was not from progesterone.  Well then I sunk into the worst CHEMICAL depression.  Keep in mind that I have no history of anxiety or depression.  I have heard that progesterone (even depo provera) can really mess you up.  I am now on antidepressants due to this experience.,F,34,10  days,1/17/2005,Progesterone
439, 3, dysfunctional uterine bleeding,Very painful swelling of my abdomen.  Very moody. No patience.,It did stop the bleeding very effectively_ but I am having a hysterectomy on Tues. and can't wait to get off this medication.  I actually have been losing weight (5lbs) in last week.  Probably because the bloating is so severe.,F,47,7  days,1/12/2005,Progesterone
440, 4, Using the Shot for Birth Control,uterine cyst,I'm unsure if this was a true side effect of taking the shot. I have looked over every other possible way I have gotten these. Uterine Cysts seam to be caused by the egg removing itself from the uterine lining. After not having a period for 6 months I thought I was ok. I thought that my body was getting used to being on the shot and there for I would no longer have a period_ however_ two days ago I started my period with intence cramping pain_ yesterday I went to the hospital being unable to move. They told me I have 3 Uterine Cysts_ larger then they normally see. I was perscribed Tylonal 3 for the pain but there is not much else they can do without seeing if the Cysts go away natrually.As I said I'm unsure weither this is related or not_ the MD at the hospital said it very much could be. I'm a 7 yr smoker_ don't know if that has to do with it but going to post it here so ya'll know a possible side effect that was not noticed in the origional testing. Also I started the shot 1 day after delivery of my first full term pregnancy.,F,21,15  months,12/24/2004Email,Progesterone
441, 1, heavy periods,Depression_ moodyness_ bleeding (the opposite of what we wanted),I've had a period for two weeks now after starting the dru_ and I just had a period two weeks before using it.  I have ITP and we thought by going on the pill it would lessen my bleeding.  It did the opposite and my valueable platelets have dropped enormously and they were very hard to get them up in the first place.  My doc wants to put me on a pill with more estrogen but I'm afraid to take anything else.,F,23,14  days,11/19/2004Email,Progesterone
442, 1, Doctor told me my levels were low,About 2 days after starting the cream_ I got very irritable_ crampy_ breasts became tender and I was tired.

444, 4, painful ovulation,Initial burst of energy 1/2 hour after application (I cannot use it before bedtime). Was diagnosed with a cervical polyp after 6 months of use (may not be related to the cream at all).,The bio-identical progesterone cream relieved so many things that had plagued me for a long time. Mood swings_ insomnia_ painful ovulation_ spotting between periods_ low libido. After a few months_ though_ it seemed to only work on the ovulation discomfort_ which is what I was taking it for anyways.,F,40,6  months,10/26/2004,Progesterone
445, 1, perimenopausal symptoms,My initial reaction to progesterone was severe headaches and nausea. However_ that was nothing compared to the weightgain_ bloating and swelling in my legs and almost debilitating breasts tenderness...had I investigated this drug on my own I would not have taken it...,Although this is a natural steroid_ it seemingly has the nearsame effects as other medical steroids do for stimulating theappetite...that should be something that a sensible doctorwould warn a patient of.,F,43,28  days,10/24/2004Email,Progesterone

My overall health feels amazingly normal for the first time in years!!!!,PLEASE NOTE THAT NATURAL PROGESTERONE AND PRESCRIPTION-TYPES ARE NOT THE SAME!!!!

452, 2, menopausal symptoms,depression and anxiety which was probably due to the fact that the dose was too high.

453, 1, PMS_ weight gain,depression_ moodiness_ queezy_ headache,I am sensitive to hormones and have since found that progesterone in any form; oral contraceptives_ pregnancy_ pre-menstrually (days 14-28)_ and the cream_ cause the same side effects; depression mostly_ but other things like nausea_ and headaches.      My sister however_ has a better mood when on oral contraception_ progesterone cream and during her 14 to 28 day part of her cycle.  For her_ depression sets in about day 28 until about day 14.  Other women_ like my mother_ do not have mood changes or other adverse side effects with hormone changes in any of the aforementioned senarios.     I wonder if there is a division in women into three groups: One group of women who react positively to more progesterone.  Another group who react negatively to more progesterone.  And a third group who do not react one way or the other.      I would not know if this is due to the progesterone-estrogen balance I have heard about_ or a persons sensitivity to hormones or something entirely different.  But_ that has been something I have learned and observed in my own life.       I am pregnant for the third time and am on anti-depression medication during pregnancy as depression is most highly present with high levels of progesterone.  Therefore_ I am not susceptible to post-partum depression_ but someone like my sister who is in a better mood on the pill and in pregnancy_ is susceptible to post-partum depression. By the way_ I am an RN and the study of hormones is of great interest to me.,F,, ,5/20/2003Email,Progesterone
