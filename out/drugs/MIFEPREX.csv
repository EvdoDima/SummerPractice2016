1, 4, Medical Abortion,Brief Fever_ Itching_ and RednessSevere CrampsSevere FatigueDizzinessNauseaVomitingHeadache Muscle weakness Severe Diarrhea,I took Mifeprex (the first pill) at my local Planned Parenthood_ was all good except for some really slight cramping.As instructed 24 hours later I took the Misoprostol tablets_ holding 2 in each cheek for 30 min. They don't completely dissolve in that time_ so I swallowed what was left. While I was waiting_ maybe 10-15 min into it_ I started to feel the familiar pain of regular period cramps_ every minute after the pain got worse. At that point it was just moderately increasing cramps_ and what felt like gas pain/ diarrhea.  At maybe minute 28 I drag myself to the bathroom_ which was hella harder than it should have been due to extreme fatigue. Basically_ rode waves of seriously intense pain. They say that your supposed to have an experience similar to your worst period_ I don't know whose period I was channeling because I have NEVER EVER had a period remotely equal to this. I felt my face get hot_ so much so I had to lean my face against the wall. My skin was burning hot. My palms started to feel the same way_ swollen_ itchy_ and hot. It was hard to breathe_ my chest was tight. I was shaking like a leaf in a blender on high. Luckily_ common sense berated me into walking. I could barely stand my legs shook so much.Mash Emergency Care was less than a block away_ normal walking distance. Figured can't hurt. Severe shakes turned a 3 minute walk into 15 min. Any smell close enough made me sick. Not so elegantly I sprawled on to the reception desk_ signed in_ and wait,F,24,2  days,5/23/2016Email,Mifeprex

3, 5, Abortion,Cramps bleeding nausea,I was only 3 weeks and 2 days pregnant but the ultrasound woman lied and told me I was 6 weeks and 6 days which I knew was impossible. They do this to get more money out of you. Took the first pill mifepristone at the clinic and felt nothing at all. Took mifeprex the next day at 4:30 held them in my cheeks for about 10 mins. Cramps started to set in about an hour and a half later so I took 2 ibuprofen. Another 30 mins and the cramps start to get worse and worse then the ibuprofen sets in and they subside to mild cramps. I laid in bed watching TV for about 3 hours waiting on the bleeding to start and eventually around 10:00 is when I started to bleed. I had small clots and mild bleeding due to not being that far long I'm guessing. I bled moderately all night and when I woke up the worst was over. After that my nausea was gone (thank god) and I spotted for about 2 weeks then got a very mild period a week after that. Overall my experience was easy and not bad at all.,F,23,1  days,5/28/2015Email,Mifeprex
4, 5, 6-7 weeks pregnant,For anyone taking Mifeprex_ 800mg of Ibuprofen will not help you with these types of cramps. The cramps are very strong labor cramps. You need to take another strong type of medication with it and you will be fine. Be somewhere comfortable and make sure you are on a full tummy.,People do not understand that Ibuprofen alone will do nothing for you. Put on a maxipad. Take some STRONG medicine. And sleep it all away! I had a good experience_ I was knocked out the whole time and I did not go through any of those horrible stories I have read. I did have 1 huge clot when I woke up. It will not be as fast as the surgical_ but it is much less invasive in my opinion. I took it a couple of days ago and now I am having what feels like a regular period. I have not gone to the follow up yet. All i want to say is Dont be scared_ girls. And I wish all of you the best. This is what worked for me.,F,19,1  days4 pills 1X O,10/1/2014,Mifeprex

7, 3, Termination,I went to the clinic filled out all the paperwork then had my vitals checked. Then I had my ultrasound the lady could not see the pregnancy so a vaginal ultrasound had to be done I was 4wks 6 day. I took the first pill at the clinic no problems at all I went about my as usual. The next day I took the other 4 pills vaginally with 30 minutes I experience the worst cramps in my life. I need a heating pad to help with the pain within 4 hours I was better. By the next day I was fine and went to work on that Monday. Two weeks later for my check up was postponed because I was bleeding. A week later I went back for my check up and everything was good. A month later I had a period I thought everything was back to normal. It has almost been 6 months and I had bleed everyday for 4 months straight.,,F,29,1  days200mg,12/9/2013Email,Mifeprex

9, 3, Medical Abortion,Vomiting_ Sever cramping and contractions_ chills_ sweats_ 10/10 pain,I went to the sketchiest abortion clinic in the world and was given 1 pill in office and instructed to let the other 3 pills dissolve in my cheek 2 days later. Those were literally my only instructions. No pain medication. No antibiotic. Told it would be like a period. I was 5 weeks along. So on the day I was instructed to take the remaining three pills_ I started bleeding slightly right before I took them_ was able to take 3 of my friend's leftover vicodin (5's) and then took all three pills_ let them dissolve one at a time_ all were ingested within 5 minutes. Walked into my kitchen to heat up my cornbag expecting cramping_ but not to the severity that they were. Within 5 minutes of standing in my kitchen_ I my uterus began cramping and I rushed to my room to lay down. I got really sweaty and achey_ and I rushed to the bathroom and dry heaved and vomited 8 times. Then_ I experienced literally the most excruciating pain I've ever felt in my entire life. I was laying on the tile floor and uncontrollably moaning and yelling and sobbing and kicking my legs and just putting my hands on the tub side because it was cold. I was dripping sweat and could feel my body going through contractions. I don't know if I took them too fast or what_ but I read as much as I could online and saw nothing like what I was experiencing. After an hour of agony_ I was able to get to my bed and just cry out of panic for an hour. But after that_ the pain dulled to a 4/10 and really only exceeded,F,20,  1X D,8/12/2013,Mifeprex
10, 5, Unplanned pregnancy,First off_ I want to Start by stating that this is a excellent choice for a woman who is doing this for the first time_ it basically causes you to have a miscarriage. Day one: I went to a clinic my doctor referred me to_ and there they had me fill out paperwork regarding the experience/ consent form. Then I waited in the waiting for a moment(horrified ofcourse) I was called in by the nurse into the room where they gave me a ultrasound. Using a probe. It determined I was 6 weeks and 2 days pregnant. They were able to see on the screen there was a embryo present. I went back into the waiting room_ later I was called in to do a blood test to determine my blood type. Then back into the waiting where then a counselor called me in to a office where she had a personal talk about my decision. She asked me over and over again if I was 100% sure about the medical abortion_ I assured her that I have never done this before_ and that I was to scared to do the surgical. She went over the facts about the pill. Afterwards I went back into the waiting room where I waited 2 hrs. The nurse called my name_ I went In to a room where the doctor gave me a pelvic exam to make sure my uterus and everything else is in place. It only took 5 mins. They gave me the first pill to take In the office with ginger ale. The doctor reminded me that cramping may occur instantly or hours later_ or maybe after you take the other set of pills the day after. I was sent home. Didn't feel much pain_ but was very nausea,,F,23,1  days,3/13/2013,Mifeprex
11, 1, Medical Abortion,I took the pill in the office. The nurse had asked me several times if I was sure about it & I told her definitely. Nothing happened... the next day I took the 4 by cheek. I threw up not too long after they dissolved. I waited for a while but nothing happened so I got a warm compress_ put it on my stomach_ after 5 mins my lower abdomen felt heavy. I went to the bathroom where clot after clot came out. Fast forward to a month later_ I was still letting out clots. Couldn't walk small distances & almost blacked out on the train. I went to the hospital where I found out that my hemoglobin was at 5 when it should've been 13. I was severely anemic. I spent 3 nights in the ER & had a blood transfusion. 2 yrs later & I still expect to see clots when I'm on my period. I wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemies,,F,24,1  days,1/14/2013,Mifeprex
12, 5, Medical Abortion,Vomiting_ Severe Cramps_ Uncontrollable Shaking,I felt nauseated after I took the first pill at the Dr.s office and was very reluctant to take the other 4 pills because of everything I read about the drug. 24 hrs later I took the 4 pills in my cheeks and waited. About 1 hr later the Cramping started. I cannot take Vicodin because it makes me sick so I asked the dr. to prescribe me something else so he gave me Tylenol 3 with Codeine. This was the worst mistake. The tylenol kept wearing off during the whole ordeal which lasted 12 hours and was very painful for me. I couldnt stop shaking and during the most painful moments I was walking around my living room in circles crying because the pain was so bad. I also was breathing just like I was in labor. It was terrible. Throughout the whole ordeal_ I bled very little and at about the 4th hour the sac came out but I was still in pain and had severe cramping for the next 8 hours. I finally was able to fall asleep and the next day I just felt really sore. Overall_ Im glad that it is over and it worked.The only advice I can give is take the strong pain pills.  I feel like it would've been a more tolerable experience if I would've just listened to the Dr in the first place with the Vicodin.,F,27,  1X D,11/12/2012,Mifeprex

14, 5, Unwanted pregnancy,I was definitely nervous before going through with this method but_ I am happy to say that is was so much easier than I anticipated. I took the first pill at the clinic I decided to go to. I was told I was 7 weeks and 1 day along. I didn't feel any side effects at all except for how I was already feeling (fatigue and nausea) due to the pregnancy anyways. The next day at 3:30 pm I took the 4 mifeprex pills (2 in each cheek for 30 mins to dissolve) as told. I was pleasently surprised that they did not taste like anything so it made it much easier. After the 30 minutes I drank some water to swallow what was left and immediately threw up. I think it was due to the consistency of the pills. About 2 hours later I felt a gush into the pad. I bleed heavily for about the next 4 to 5 hours. The most uncomfortable thing of the whole ordeal was everytime I sat on the toilet large amounts of bloodclots gushed out which freaked me out feeling. My cramps were minimal_ I had taken the pain killers beforehand which definitely mustve helped. At about 11:30 pm the bleeding almost completely stopped and was like a light period. Next day I felt kind of tired from being up late but very relieved and much better. This is a great choice for anyone wanting to do this in the privacy of their home and very worth it.,,F,24,1  days1,10/12/2012Email,Mifeprex
15, 5, Abortion,I was told I was about 5 weeks 4 days (based on missed period) pregnant. I believe I was only 3 weeks 5 days pregnant (based on possible conception date) . My sac measured 7 or 8 mm not exactly sure. I took the mifeprex in the drs office felt nothing. No bleeding or anything. 2 days later i went back and the dr inserted 2 tabs of misoprostol (sp?) vaginally. I was told to take 2 more of the same pills by mouth 2 hours later. About an hour before I had the pills placed vaginally i had taken 4 200 mg ibuprophen pills. I felt slight cramping and bleeding about 2 hours after receiving the misoprostol vaginally. It started with the sac passing then bleeding fresh bright red blood. After 2 hours I took 2 more misoprostol pills orally. Just swollowed like normal pills. Then after everything i just bled like a light period. Not even filling my pads all the way. I was worried that i wasnt bleeding enough. I kept taking the ibuprophen every 3 hours id take 3 then the 4th hour id take one more. I didnt want to feel anything !! I also took 1 vicodin which did nothing. I went to sleep after this. The next few weeks i bled like a normal period then i had some spotting. It was a natural experience. Now. Im a Catholic. Grew up Catholic my whole life.

16, 5, abortion,,My doctor prescribed mifeprex to take for the first dosage_ and 4 pills of cytotec to take the following day.  I took the mifeprex at 4pm_ and felt nothing whatsoever.  The following evening_ at about 10pm I was watching TV on the couch and felt a gush of blood leak out into the pad.  I went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet_ and immediately started bleeding heavily.  There was still no pain_ but it was obvious that the abortion was in progress as I could feel the blood clots falling into the toilet.  This continued for about 2 hours and then slowed considerably.  The next morning_ there was still no pain_ and one last clot (which appeared to be the grey/white gestational sac) fell into the toilet.  This same day at 4pm (48 hrs after mifeprex) I took the 4 pills of cytotec orally and let them dissolve.  About 30 minutes later severe cramping begun_ but not more than a heavy crampy period.  The cramping lasted until about 11pm that night.  Bleeding was only moderate during this whole evening_ I assume because I had already aborted the day before.  My experience with this procedure was an overall 100% satisfaction.  I was 6 weeks and 4 days upon taking this medication.,F,26,1  days 1X D,8/10/2012Email,Mifeprex
17, 1, Terminate pregnancy,It seemed to work. 5 days after taking Mifeprex_ I woke up with the worst cramping and abdominal pain I had ever experienced. I called the clinic emergency number. The nurse told me additional cramping is not uncommon. I cried in pain for many hours. I knew this pain was not normal_ but after talking with the nurse I thought I could suffer through it. I had some heavier bleeding_ then it seemed to subside. I went on with my day. I never imagined what would happen next. I woke up at 5 am and had hemmhoraged so much blood that I went into shock and lost consciousness.

20, 4, Medical abortion_ 5 weeks & 4 days,Very painful for 3 hours,Another story focusing on the pain- not meant to repel women from choosing this method_ but to advocate for having physical and emotional support nearby_ just as you might for normal labor. I was 5 weeks and 4 days pregnant on day 1. I took the Mifeprex at the doctor's office_ and inserted 4 tablets of Misoprostol (vaginally) 15 hours later (within the 12-48 hour recommended window). For 1-2 hours after inserting the Misoprostol there was not much action (light cramping). Then it began- nausea_ severe uterine pain on par with labor contractions_ diarrhea and vomiting. I took 1 vicodin but likely vomited it before full absorbtion. This phase lasted for 3 hours. The passing of blood and clumps was expected_ the high level of pain was not- it was on par with childbirth. I had no idea that this would be the case. After those 3 grueling hours I reverted to cramps (as strong as my most painful period_ but manageable with a hot water bottle and 2-3 tylenol) and continued bleeding for several days.  Ultimately_ I feel satisfied to have chosen the medical vs. surgical version_ but if I had to do this over again Id have a midwife present. Next time someone sends me home with just-in-case bottle of narcotics_ I wont be so naïve!,F,32,1  days200 mg 1X O,1/14/2012,Mifeprex
21, 5, Medical abortion,I did not experience any symptoms until I took the 4 abortion pills roughly 26 hours later. Within the hour I experienced moderate cramping that came in waves and lasted only a few minutes at a time. I passed the sac no more than 2 hours later and the cramping stopped altogether shortly after that. The bleeding also slowed but was never really heavy to begin with. I know everyone's body reacts differently but for me this was virtually painless and I would recommend it to anyone.,,F,24,1  days1X D,1/8/2012,Mifeprex

24, 5, Medical Abortion,I took Mifeprex on a Thursday afternoon. By Friday afternoon I was very nauseated but was able to work through it all. About 30 minutes before I took the misoprostol I did throw up but I think it was from me taking my antibiotics on an empty stomach. After putting the Misoprostol in my cheeks I was hit with another wave of vomiting and barely kept the misoprostol in my cheeks. After throwing up about a dozen times I was fine and went and laid on the couch with a heating pad. I fell asleep for about 2 hours and woke up with some moderate cramping and had a mild urge to push. I did and passed the sac. I am only about 6 weeks along and the sac was the size of a golf ball. It was pretty obvious it was the sac as it was a light gray color and very different than the other clots. I've continued to have mild cramping but nothing unbearable. I've only needed to take pain meds once. I pass a lot of clots when on the toilet but barely any on the pad. This was by far a better option than surgical and much less painful. Well worth the additional price!,,F,28,3  days200mg,12/3/2011,Mifeprex

I normally have high pain tolerance_ I experienced kidney stones & all that was to me was uncomfortable_ but these cramps were really bad. After the hour or two of cramping_ it died down to regular period cramps. Every hour I would apply heat to my abdomen which helped a lot. The pain meds didn't really do anything for me but make me sick. It's been 7 days since I took the last 4 pills & I still have heavy bleeding & clotting but overall_ it was SO worth it.

26, 5, Abortion,After the Mifeprex_ I felt nothing until about 17 hrs later. Then_ heavy bleeding began_ but it was painless.,"At 7 wks_ 3 days.  I took a Vicodin and over-the-counter nausea medication at 7:45pm after eating a full dinner. At 8:35pm_ I placed the 4 cytotec pills in my cheeks and spit them out at 9:05pm. Felt nothing until 9:25 when I felt moderate cramping and ran to the bathroom to throw up. Lost my dinner. The cramping got stronger and was painful_ but bearable. Some light diarrhea and fever-like chills/sweating followed that was short-lived. I heated a water bottle for my abdomen_ was drinking lots of water to replenish_ and curled up with the bottle in bed around 10:30 and was able to sleep. The cramps had lessened. I woke up at 1:45am with heavy bleeding_ clotting and mild to moderate cramping and sweating again. I took 1 more Vicodin_ drankna bunch of water and went back to sleep for hours. I woke up with no cramps or nausea_ just bleeding. Is this an unpleasant experience? Yes. Was it bearable? Absolutely_ and it was completely over after a few hours. There is no more ""humane"" way to have an abortion. Abortion is inducing early labor and expelling a fetus.

28, 5, pregnancy termination,Four weeks pregnant: One strong contraction with a gush of blood accompanied by diarrhea. No other problems. This review written 31 hours after taking misoprostol.,After all the terror I suffered preparing for this ordeal (my first experience with birth control failure_ religious upbringing_ etc) I'm so happy. Day one I took the Mifeprex in a clinic. I asked for pain and anxiety meds. I felt great for the next two days_ no side effects. After ~52 hours_ I took a Vicodin_ waited 30 minutes_ placed the misoprostol between my cheeks and gums. One note - I only weigh 100 pounds so I took the liberty of reducing the dose from 4 to 3 pills without consulting a clinician. I was afraid of the severe pain I've heard of others experiencing. The 3 pills took an hour and a half to dissolve_ which I didn't expect_ therefore waited that long to take a 600 mg ibuprofen chaser. Even after that_ I felt only minor lower abdominal cramps_ and was so comfortable I got hungry on hour three and went out to dinner. Luckily I wore a pad because as soon as I began to eat I had to run to the bathroom as it felt like I had diarrhea. For about 10 seconds on the toilet I worried because it was really bad cramping_ but it went away as fast as it came. I went home (finished my food!)waited for anything bad to happen_ but there was just bleeding when I sat on the toilet. At about 11 hours_ I woke up and took 2 Advil for minor cramping_ and went back to sleep. I then got up and went to work this morning like a normal day. Have had clots and thick bloody discharge when I pee but minor spotting on the maxi pad_ no pain. Feeling emotionally better than I have in 2 weeks.,F,38,1  days1 1X D,3/14/2011,Mifeprex

Two on each side of the cheek and let it stay for 30 minutes then swallow the rest. I waited an hour then took some percocet and I felt no pain. The bleeding and bloodclots however where alot. It is day 6 and I am still bleeding but not as heavy. Other than the heavy bleeding this is way better then going to the clinic and having it sucked out.

I changed my mind after I had taken it and today went to the dr to find my baby is fine_ heartbeat normal_ everything.

32, 4, unwanted pregnancy,severe cramping_ vomiting_ dizziness_ brief loss of consciousness after standing up too quickly (MEDS:  mifeprex/misoprostol_ phenergen_ percocet_ xanax),I do not regret choosing a medical abortion over a surgical one.  I will avoid an abortion clinic entrusting a doctor I've never met with my future fertility at all costs.  However_ my cramping was very severe.  I have a high pain tolerance_ and Percocet did not even begin to take the edge off the pain I experienced.  Almost as unbearable as the cramping were the muscle aches in my legs.  For me_ it lasted somewhere between 4-6 hours.  I continued to bleed for several weeks thereafter_ but did not have any cramping.  I have mild to moderate cramping during my periods_ but did have stronger cramps when I was younger.  Please note that I am in no way trying to scare anyone.  This was my personal experience_ and I would not hesitate to do it again.  I just find it incredibly insulting that some of you would imply an experience like mine is somehow invalid based upon your experience alone.  Unlike any other medical treatments_ mifeprex/misoprostol is always administered as a one size fits all dosage.  I suspect I am much more sensitive to the drug than most.  If I had to do it again_ I probably would not take all 4 misoprostol at once_ due to my reaction to the drug.,F,29,  1X D,11/9/2010,Mifeprex
33, 5, Pregnancy Termination,I took Mifeprex on day 1_ on day 3 I was instructed to place the 4 remaining pills in my mouth on the inside of my cheeks where they would dissolve for a half hour_ then I swallowed what was left of the pills. After washing the pills down with water_ I threw up violently all of the water and my body insisted I keep throwing up when there was nothing left to give (due to nausea in the first place). About 30mins later I started to experience the worst pain I have ever felt in my lower stomach and staggered hunched over to the bathroom where I immediately started to bleed in the toilet. I waited on the toilet for as long as my body would allow me to sit upright and flushed without looking. I was sweating heavily but was freezing at the same time so I wrapped myself in a towel. Back in bed_ I could not get comfortable. I tried turning on each of my sides in a fetal position and nothing helped so I frequently changed positions_ wincing in pain_ and squeezed the covers around me tight.,!!!PLEASE READ FIRST!!!MY PHYSICAL CONDITION LEADING UP TO MIFEPREX: During my 6th week of pregnancy I was very nauseous everyday. I had only been able to eat small portions of blan foods such as pretzels and was drinking chicken broth and water the week prior to taking Mifeprex. Still_ I think my body was very weak and dehydrated which may or may not have contributed to the side effects. I strongly suggest gatorade and pretzels or crackers_ they were my only comfort during this process. Also get at least two days off from work during the bleeding. With as much pain and discomfort I experienced_ I do not regret my decision for taking Mifeprex and would recommend it to others. It was difficult but I felt 100 percent better in the following days.,F,23,3  days 1X D,8/12/2010Email,Mifeprex
34, 5, abortion,almost none. biggest worry was throwing up which i experienced a couple times a day. only very mild cramping and very brief bleeding and passing of bloodclots. didnt even take the prescription pain meds_ just 2 advil and still felt alright.,,F,19,  1X D,7/13/2010,Mifeprex
35, 5, abortion,i guess everyone is different_ but i had very little pain form this. it was like a heavy period to me. i was 6 weeks 3 days. i had a little nausea the morning after taking the dose at the office_ then on the 3rd day did the 4 pills vaginally to dissolve. about an hour later i had some mild cramping and passed blood clots for a few hours but that as well as the crampling stopped with in about 5 or 6 hours.,it is now day 5 and i still have some light bleeding but i feel good. i was very thankful that i was about to have a medical abortion instead of surgical. do what is right for you. dont believe all the horror stories online. just talk to your doctor and i am sure they can let you talk with some REAL people who have taken it. good luck to all. i know it is scary but you will make it thru everything.,F,32,  1X D,5/25/2010,Mifeprex
36, 5, early pregnancy termination,minimal nausea and fatigue with the Mifiprex_ moderate_ but not intolerable cramping with the misoprostol,I was very nervous about taking the misoprostol based on ratings here and other sites.  Here is my experience:  5 pm- took Iburofen 800mg_ 6 pm- took Percocet and Zofran (nausea)_ 7 pm- took misoprostol_ allowing to dissolve in cheeks for 45 min_ 8pm- mild bleeding_ 10 pm-2 am- able to sleep_ mod cramping_ (feeling like I had the breath knocked out of me_ in a way) took 2 more Percocet and 800 mg IBP.  9 am- cramping done_ still had some bleeding with clots_ but not painful.Much less traumatic than I expected_ very little pain.  I feel tired today_ but am able to be up and about.,F,37,1  days 1X D,5/3/2010,Mifeprex
37, 4, To end an 8 week_ 6 day pregnancy,Hardly any cramping but unpredictable blood flow for 2 weeks now,"I was expecting the worst side effects per the clinician at Planned Parenthood - not from online sources.  After taking the first pill at the clinic I felt nothing the rest of the day.  After 24 hours I placed the 4 pills between my teeth and cheeks as instructed and waited. This wasn't a horrible ordeal.  After 2 hours I thought it didn't work because I still felt nothing THEN came the gush.  The passing of the ""lemon sized clot"" (as predicted by PPH) was a little shocking as was seeing all of the matter pass but from then on the bleeding was off and on.  Tomorrow will be 2 weeks and the bleeding hasn't stopped but I guess that's expected.  The only bad part of this experience (physically) is the unpredictable flow - today alone I had to change my tampon 20 minutes after insertion then nothing the rest of the day.  I have had very little cramping - maybe a 3 on a 1 to 10 scale - and no headaches_ nausea or vomiting...  Everyone is different.  I wouldn't base how u decide to term your pregnancy on other people's experiences. I do wonder if the women that had horrible cramps with using Mifeprex_ have bad cramps regularly with their period.  I very rarely ever have cramps.",F,30,  1X D,5/2/2010,Mifeprex
38, 5, unwanted pregnancy in its 7th week,Slight to moderate cramping which lasted for about an hour and a half.,I was expecting the worst after all the horror stories I read online about Mifeprex but it turned out that I had stressed over nothing and the procedure was surprisingly not only tolerable but rather painless. I took two different strong painkillers half an hour before inserting the two misoprostol tablets vaginally_ and experienced some slight cramping (I've had sharper and more painful menstrual cramps in past periods) which I napped through. When I woke up_ I ate some breakfast and then over the course of the next two hours_ I expelled a bunch of blood and clots with each trip to the toilet. The bleeding seemed excessive at first and came in big gushes at a time but according to the nurse I talked to it's normal. The bleeding tapered off significantly by the afternoon. I was so relieved afterwards how smoothly things went and was glad that my doctor talked me into this instead of the surgery.,F,27,3  days,1/28/2010,Mifeprex
39, 1, 3 week  4day pregnancy termination,BAD IDEA! I read one comment that said people write bad experiences are just trying to scare you- I am not trying to scare anyone I just want to tell the world to go surgical vs. pill!! IT'S NOT WORTH THE PAIN! My experience- I went to clinic in Austin_ ultra sound said 3 weeks 4 days_ which was EXACTLY correct to the day. (By the way_ all abortion clinics make you stay forever so bring a book and blanket_ you won't get out of staying there for 4 to 6 hours no matter where you go.) I took the first pill. No symptoms.. 36 hours later I followed all the instructions and took 1 vicodin and 1 promythazine and waited 30 minutes. Then I took all 4 of the 2nd pill. 30 minutes later I was sitting on the toilet using the bathroom_ bleeding_ had a fever_ threw up once_ and THE WORST CRAMPS OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. I found myself breathing as if I was in child labor. I was praying to God to help just stop the pain. I have a high pain tolerance_ but this was not tolerable_ it was beyond mental.,-I WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS HAD I KNOWN THE AMOUNT OF SEVERE PAIN I WOULD EXPERIENCE. (The pain was so intense_ even if it was for 5 minutes of pain I wouldn't do it again.) -If you must do this_ drink a lot of water before because you will sweat and vomit water during the process_ and adding dehydration to this mix can't make it any better.-Massaging the uterus will help pass clots.-I HAVE A B.S. IN BUSINESS_ I HAVE NEVER POSTED A REVIEW FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT MIFEPREX_ TRUST ME- THIS OPTION IS NOT WORTH THE PAIN!!!!!!!! Get the surgery if anything!*one more thing- your hormones are going to be very out of balance and you will be crazy for a few days after this pill_ also don't have sex after any abortion for at least two weeks because of suseptibility to infection and pregnancy.,F,24,1  days,12/5/2009Email,Mifeprex
40, 4, termination of a 4 week pregnancy,"From the mifeprex alone_ I honestly didn't feel much different - just a growing dread of taking the misoprostol to complete the process.  I admit I was terrified of having a bad experience like most of what I've read here_ esp the one comparing it to the surgical procedure and how the pill isn't ""worth it"".  I'm glad i tried out the pill option_ really.  It went like clockwork and the pain was completely manageable with my lortab prescription and anti-nausea pills.  No diarrhea_ never vomited_ and my cramps were of moderate to heavy period strength.  I sat on the toilet after I'd been bleeding lightly for an hour (this was 4 hours after taking misoprostol) and passed what I think was the gestational sac and placenta.  Every few hours after this_ I would drop clots that seemed large but not painful or suspicious and so on until I fell asleep for the night.  That's it. My bleeding basically stopped the day after. Now_ on that next day_ I would try to keep in mind how traumatic","in comparison to aspiration abortion_ the pain here was NOTHING! my experience with the surgical procedure was not as easy as some like to describe_ but then my recent trial with the medical abortion was a walk in the park compared to some womens' horror stories.  i prepared myself for the worst mentally and physically_ but was relieved with how easily the process took care of itself. i'm grateful to have had the comfort of my home and partner to guide me through the emotional part of it. the absolute worst moment in all this was seeing what my body passed into the toilet and the thought processes that followed. in that respect_ i wish that the US handled medical abortion the same as in the UK - with women undergoing their ""miscarriages"" in a hospital setting and then sent home to recover. it seems a little more humane in terms of tissue disposal and monitoring of all the side effects that can occur just after taking the misoprostol. Don't be scared to try this because of the more intense and negative experiences you find researching online.  Not to discredit what these women went through_ but if you're in the category of those who have this pill option_ don't put yourself through a surgical procedure if you can avoid that type of invasion and (very different kind of) pain.",F,20,1  days,11/1/2009,Mifeprex
41, 1, terminate 7 week pregnancy,"I experienced no side effects after taking Mifeprex_ the ""first"" pill which actually stops the pregnancy. I waited the necessary minimum 24 hours before taking Misoprostol (the 4 pills that dissolve in your mouth) at 10 a.m. that started the rest of the process. The bad taste of these four pills is a walk through the park with what I experienced for the next 14 hours. I was given Vicodin for pain and Phenergen for nausea. I needed both. After a severe cramp_ I usually expelled a very large clot. This went on for about 6 hours. Seven hours into the procedure I started very heavy cramping_ bleeding and clotting. This did not seem normal. An hour later I experienced a gush of blood and tissue as never before. Didn't make it to the toilet in time. No fun cleaning up your own abortion while you're experiencing it. I became scared and called the nurse hotline. I described everything_ she assured me that the worst is over and it will die down. I had two more ""visitations""",I regret my decision to do a pill abortion. I am an intelligent_ professional woman. Ten years ago_ I had a surgical abortion (suction) to terminate a 10 week pregnancy. Yes_ the pill method does allow you privacy in that you experience the abortion at home on your own terms_ but here is the crux of the matter - why suffer? Why . . . suffer? Whatever method you choose_ you're still in control.In both cases_ the doctors and staff at the clinics I went to were very professional_ supportive_ thorough_ compassionate and listened well.  A pill abortion involves very powerful medication. Once you start_ you're own your own to make decisions that really should be made by trained medical personnel. Choosing an abortion is an intensely personal decision. Take your time before agreeing to a method. I am pro-choice. Never take your legal right to an abortion for granted. The choice? Terminate a pregnancy in 10 minutes with little to no pain_ or choose (potential) hours of pain and bleeding. In my opinion_ the most humane (think about this) method is a surgical abortion.,F,45,1  days,10/4/2009,Mifeprex
42, 4, Medical Abortion,After taking the first pill_ I had no side affects. I was actually worried that I was feeling too good. I was afraid the medication wouldn't work. After dissolving the four pills in my cheeks two days later_ I had no doubts it was working. I was surprised by the intense pain of the cramping. I think it was the worst pain I've experienced_ although_ needed. They started slow at first_ and then intensified for about two hours until I passed the tissue. I was given vicodin_ which I took before hand_ but I don't think I gave it enough time to kick in. Also_ eat before you take the second set of pills!! I was horribly sick_ and vomiting nonstop because they had upset my stomach.But_ it is more private than a surgical abortion_ and they highly recommended it because I was only 4 weeks pregnant. Overall_ I think it was a better alternative and I'm still happy with my decision.,,F,19,3  days,9/5/2009,Mifeprex

Dr. gave me the mifeprex pill to take orally which i did. Then handed me a small bag with the 4 misoprostol tablets and told me to insert vaginally within 72 hours. Side effects w/just the oral mifefprex were nausea and sluggishness but not enough to miss work or be in pain. I noticed a slight brownish discharge about a day after taking the oral pill but had no cramping until after inserting the 4 vaginal tablets,I waited to insert the vaginal tab's because I went out of town so I waited almost 2 days after taking the oral mifeprex.The Dr. told me not to wait too long after because the abortion may not work...Woke up at 3am took Tylenlo 3 and waited... 4am_ inserted the vaginal tablets and just went back to sleep_ woke up at 8am and got up to use the bathroom and was already heavily bleeding with clotting. I did take the Tylenol 3 before inserting the tabs but the cramps were pretty strong..The really bad cramps lasted from about 8am to 1pm that day.  Had to use a pad for the next 5 days because of heavy bleeding. I only took 3 more Tylenol 3 pills throughout the 5 days and mixed it up with ibuprofen and then midol. About day 4 I noticed some heavy cramps and pain in the abdomen but also discharged more clots with may have been the last of the embryo.

I had a prescription of 4 tylenol with codeine pills.  That was all for the pain.  Even with the codeine the pain was excruciating.

The cramping was no worse than a normal period for me_ probably because of the vicodin.,"The ""women"" on here that say it was horrible and very painful are trying to scare you away from abortion. It's hard to find real patient experiences on the internet_ this was the only one I could find. After reading these comments I was hesitant_ just as the person below me. I went to the clinic. The procedures were easy and painless. The worst part was having a vaginal sonogram because the doctor couldn't see the pregnancy with a regular sonogram and it was only slightly uncomfortable for a couple seconds. You take the cytotec vaginally 3 days after your visit to the clinic at home and it does require you to lay down and not get up for 8 hours. My cramping started about an hour after I took it and I started to bleed 4 or 5 hours later. The cramps are mild to slightly painful and the pain medication helps a lot.
