0, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,Taking from 3-4.5 mg per night before bed. This is called low dose naltrexone and is used for things like ulcerative colitis_ cancer_ and a lot of other stuff at this low dose. It helps your overall health but I came on here to warn people that is does have similar side effect to steroids in that it can make you enraged to a psycotic level where you want to beat the living ____ out of someone. Be aware of this and leave the room if you get in an argument with someone otherwise you literally will not care and will say a whole lot of _____ you would normally not say or care to say.,I use a 50mg tablet and dissolve it in 50ml of distilled water in a tincture then drip 3-4.5ml of that after shaking it so it may not be exact all the time but I am too cheap and lazy to order more exact ways to measure it. You have to get it illegally if you want to use it for ulcerative colitis or find some expensive alternative doctor to prescribe it (safest idea)_ since my bastard GI refused to prescribe it to me for UC_ all he would prescribe is steroid prednisone. I use the naltima brand or the nodict brand_ don't sense any difference between them_ both are naltrexone. ,M,46,3  years4 1X D,12/8/2015,Naltrexone hcl
1, 5, alcohol,None in particular.   Having vivid_ active dreams but not sure that is the medication because I've always had vivid dreams.,Seems to subdue alcohol cravings. Will continue as long as need be to help break the alcohol addiction.,F,63,6  weeks50mg,11/10/2014,Naltrexone hcl
2, 5, Binge drinking,Nausea_ nightmares,Miracle pill.  I haven't binge drank (which was a daily event) since I started it.  I don't understand how it works_ but  I just don't want to drink.  I've tried to drink but don't get past the first shot.  I just immediately lose interest. *shrug*  Only downside is random nausea.,F,39,3  weeks50 MG 1X D,10/7/2012Email,Naltrexone hcl
3, 5, fibromyalgia_ chronic fatigue,Wake up briefly during the night_ but fall right back to sleep.,After the first dose of LDN I had increased energy & I still have a more normal energy level; fatigue is  95% gone.  Pain relief came after about 6 wks. and has been reduced about 75%.  This med has given me back my life.  No thyroid issues while taking Armour Thyroid.,F,65,5  months3 mg 1X D,8/23/2012Email,Naltrexone hcl
4, 2, fibromyalgia,Heart palp and racing while taking with armour thyroid. Also_ nightmares when I take it after 9 Or 9:30  At night. I stopped taking lastnight till my thyroid calms down i think this drug has potential and want to try it again.,,F,35,2  months1.5,8/19/2012Email,Naltrexone hcl
5, 4, Fibromyalgia_ PTSD_ Chronic Fatigue,The first day I had so much energy and mental focus. I got more done than I have in years. Unfortunately_ that did not continue; but I still have substantially more energy and mental focus than before. No negative side effects - hard to believe; but true.,I experience more pain free days_ increased energy_ and lovely dreams. My sleep is better and longer. I used to sleep fitfully_ in pain_ with tense muscles and would awaken too early feeling like I had been in a battle all night. Now I sleep longer and deeper. I take less Advil. I think the hypervigilence (jumpiness) and disocciation that accompany my PTSD are much improved. I began taking this in the morning and moved to night time dosing. I took the first one on a Saturday morning and reorganized cabinets_ shelves and closets all day without pain or fatigue. IF that had continued I would say that it was wonderful but not totally practical for my body. Put the first dose to good use in case that happens for you! Clean closets for the fist time in several years.  Ahhhhhh....:-),F,44,2  months3 1X D,12/18/2010Email,Naltrexone hcl
6, 2, arthritis,None.,My doctor and the low-dose naltrexone website implied that LDN might help arthritis as it is an auto-immune disease. I tried 3.0 mg for five months and then 4.5 mg for five months but saw no change in symptoms. I saw no change after quitting either.,M,60,5  months3.0 mg 1X D,10/14/2010,Naltrexone hcl
7, 5, Crohn's Disease,Sleep disturbance initially. Stirred up candida giving me flu-like symptoms but an anti-candida diet has settled these down.,The low Dose Naltrexone has certainly improved my symptoms. I was in a flare when I started. Brain fog lifted immediately; number of bowel motions halved and nausea lifted in first week. Tummy pains decreased significantly and weight stabilised. My energy levels fluctuate but there is some improvement. The flare I was in stopped and I have been able to reduce my prednisone from 10mg to 8mg in the 2 months I have been on LDN.I'm so pleased to be off 6-MP and reduce my prednisone to levels I haven't been able to do for over 10 years. I'm not completely symptom-free but LDN has worked without any of the awful side-effects other drugs have. This is a terrific med.,F,54,2  months4.5mg 1X D,5/5/2010Email,Naltrexone hcl
8, 5, MS,Absolutely none. Except vivid dreams the first week.,In time_ this will be seen as a wonder drug in the low dose. Patent expired_ and thus_ the drug companies have no incentive to help get this out. It is all word of mouth or the net. But_ awareness is growing. To date_ there are over 25 serious conditions which this drug helps. It has not helped me walk better with my MS_ but it has helped with other things such as brain fog_ fatigue_ and even cognition. Beware of Nay sayers. They have an agenda.,M,59,7  months4.5 mg 1X D,4/16/2010Email,Naltrexone hcl
9, 2, fibromyalgia,Paranoia_ extreme irritability. Fits of rage.,Flew off the handle frequently while taking this.  Once I figured out it was making me that way_ I stopped it.  Almost got a divorce_ I was so mad at husband.  Now that I'm off it_ I'm not mad at him at all.,F,55,10  days4.5 mg 1X D,2/8/2010,Naltrexone hcl
10, 5, Hepatitis c,Early sleep disturbances but they passed after a week.,Am taking 3 mg. Low Dose Naltrexone for Hepatitis C_ which I started in Feb. 2009.  My viral load dropped from over a million to 18_000 and my liver function tests are normal.  Many other folks with various forms of Hepatitis are also having great results - at very low doses.  Must be made at compounding pharmacy!!!,F,57,9  months,11/22/2009Email,Naltrexone hcl
11, 5, Multiple Sclerosis,The first week_ I think that I got less sleep_ but when I got up in the morning_ I felt so good that it did not matter. I think my dreams were more fun and memorable for the first week too.,The lack of major side effects is not the point with Low Dose Naltrexone. This drug has given me my life back. By nine years after diagnosis_ I was losing some mobility_ had horrible mental fog_ and fatigue that was truly debilitating. Within weeks of starting LDN_ I felt like I could almost believe that I no longer had Multiple Sclerosis. I think that the worst thing is that it seems too good to be true and people hesitate to try it with such glowing reports. There are not side effects and no down side. At $30 per month_ there is no harm and the potential for good is enormous.,F,62,7  months,11/9/2009Email,Naltrexone hcl
12, 4, Derealization Depersonalization,Very vivid dreams_ feel very lazy_ depression,I take LDN 4.5mgs every night. It helps amazingly well with my derealization and anxiety. About a 50-75% reduction. The only problem now is I feel way more depression than I did before. I'm going to try a mood stabilizer and a antidepressant soon and see what happems.,M,32,4  weeks,9/15/2009Email,Naltrexone hcl
13, 5, Fibromyalgia,none,I took LDN - 4.5mg - and within 1 hr. felt all warm and fuzzy. This lasted 2-3 hrs. The fatigue was lifted and it felt like I was on opiods_ but I wasn'! Wonderful!,M,25,5  days,7/7/2009Email,Naltrexone hcl
14, 5, Crohn's disease,Vivid dreaming for a week,I'm taking LOW DOSE NALTREXONE (LDN) for Crohn's disease.  It's definitely helping with the symptoms after immunosuppressants stopped working.  It ALSO cleared up my arthritis pain.  My wife noted that my arthritis pain was gone and she started taking it for her arthritis pain.  Her arthritis pain is now gone also.  I highly recommend LDN.,M,67,5  months,6/13/2009Email,Naltrexone hcl
15, 3, Sjogren's Syndrome (AI-disease),Increased FT3 (thyroid hormone)_ sweating_ racing heart_ increased painful dry mouth_ deeper and longer sleep_ lower libido,I took LOW DOSE NALTREXONE (LDN) in an effort to improve Sjogren's Syndrome (an auto-immune disease). I hoped it would improve the dry mouth especially_ but the opposite happened. I read LDN could aid auto-immune diseases_ so I thought I'd give it a try... However_ something very unexpected happened. My T3-level (thyroid hormone) shot through the roof in a matter of 2 weeks. I also have hypothyroidism for which I take meds_ but it's not AI-related as no antibodies have ever been found. I only took 1.5 mg of LDN_ solved it in water and kept under the tongue for 2 minutes before swallowing. Even though I lowered the thyroid meds by a third_ I couldn't shake the hyper symptoms. So I quit after 4 weeks. LDN did improve the dry eyes some. Contrary to what is to be expected_ I also experienced lowered libido (someone suggested this was due to the hightened T3)... Might try again later at a lower dose.,F,41,30  days,1/26/2009Email,Naltrexone hcl

18, 4, Quit alcohol,Possibly some dizziness_ could be stimulating for me. Not sure about nausea_ could be Campral I am taking also. For the short time being I have no craving & don't even crave carbs or sweets which usually accompanies abstinence from alcohol.,I have a script for 6 months_ not sure how long I'll take it. I am staying in close contact with my doc. No treatment for personal reasons_ no after care_ no AA_ no nothing_ just back to personal values that work and good healthy hobbies.,M,52,2  weeks,4/12/2007,Naltrexone hcl

21, 4, Heroin addiction,Upset stomach (very unpleasant)_ difficulty sleeping_ nervousness_ loss of appetite (because of upset stomach)_ decreased sexual functioning,It's taken away the cravings so I guess the side effects are worth it.  Maybe the side effects will go away with time.,F,24,7  days,1/7/2005,Naltrexone hcl

24, 5, Trichotillomania_ OCD_ ADHD,Somewhat sedating,This drug was miraculous. It stopped my constant pacing and hair-pulling immediately. Some of these behaviors resumed slightly after the first day_ but leveled off at about 20% of what they were before. This drug rocks.,M,38,1  weeks,7/8/2002,Naltrexone hcl
