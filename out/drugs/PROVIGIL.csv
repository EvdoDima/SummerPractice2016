3, 2, For idiopathic hypersomnia,Blurred vision,Worthless_ did nothing for my symptoms_ no energy_ continued brain fog_ still got sleepy thru the day_ no concentration _ trouble remembering things _ continued to have sleep drunkeness. Could take my dosage of 100mg twice a day and sleep 13 hours get up_ non rested_ and have to take a nap within couple hours. Nap would be couple hours long. Not the wonder drug for me. Was on adderal 30 mg once a day felt normal no buzz effect_ but developed tachycardia so my doctor tried this . Now we have to look for something else to try.,F,54,1  months200 MG,3/28/2016,Provigil
4, 4, Fatigue from Fibromyalgia/CFS,Headache_ most days. Weight loss initially.,I have been taking Provigil for a couple of years for extreme fatigue/exhaustion from fibromyalgia. It worked best in the first 3 month of taking it. I felt awake but not jittery_ very focused_ less foggy and less yawning. The only downside are the headaches I get from this drug. They occur 2-3 times per week on a normal week which is unfortunate. However_ due to my insane fatigue_ I was not willing to give them up. Two years later and it still helps keep me focused_ but it seems to wear off within a few hours. I lost about 20 pounds in the first 3 months as well_ which was nice. The weight has crept back on unfortunately. Still a good medication if you can tolerate the headaches!,F,39,2  years200 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Provigil

6, 5, Extreme fatigue-only up 6 hrs daily,@200mg to start stomach pain & nausea too much_but was super woman with speedy speech.  Had to cut dose to 100mg & can tolerate. A little nap or rest around dinner_but this medicine has given me my life back.  My stomach has been gurgling_but no pain.  It causes me to smoke more due to being up & a little more hyper_but I will get a handle on_because I was in the process of quitting.  My speech sometimes gets faster_but I think is leveling out some. Overall_this medicine has given me my life back.  Hope a tolerance doesn't develop May try to increase back to 200 later only if my stomach will tolerate it_so that I won't poop out in the late afternoon.  We'll see after another couple of weeks   Hope this review helps you,,F,60,4  weeks100 mg,1/22/2016,Provigil
7, 2, Mental alertness & wakefulness,Felt slightly more awake_  Light niggling headache_ Jaw clenching_ Spacey at times_ Foot tapping to average music_ Foggy head_ Staring off into space_ Difficulty concentrating_ Trouble focusing eyes.,Day One:  200mg at 1700hrs before a 12 hr night shift_ roughly 3 hours to feel noticeable effects. Felt slightly more awake_  light niggling headache_ jaw clenching (not cool for work)_ felt a bit spacey at times_ foot tapping to average music. Was like all the undesirable affects of MDMA without the good if that makes sense.Day Two: 200mg at1600hrs before night shift_ roughly 2 hours to feel effects though had less food in stomach.  Initially felt more awake than previous night_ very foggy head_ light niggling headache_ jaw clenching_ foot tapping_ staring off into space_ difficulty concentrating_ trouble focusing vision (again similar negative effects of MDMA) for those who have used.So far not overly impressed_ don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting a limitless pill type effect but hoping for something like a Dextroamphetamine type experience with that kind of focus and mental drive. I have also read that taking too much can cause some of the foggy head side effects I experienced so I will try half dose next time and see how that goes.I also received some Armodafiinl in the sample pack so hoping that it works better for me....fingers crossed!,M,33,2  days200 1X D,10/13/2015Email,Provigil
8, 3, suspected narcolepsy_ hypersomnia,Restlessness_ anxiety and sleep paralysis on the second day. No symptom happened again after that.,Might stop working after a few weeks if taken daily. Ideal when taken intermittently; stopping (or taking less) before returning to the suggested dose usually fixes this.,F,25,4  months100mg 2X D,8/17/2015,Provigil
9, 3, Mild Narcolepsy;TBI Hypersomnia; MS,Increased wakefulness; increased concentration; improvement in cognitive function; improved memory; Severe headaches; anxiety (which can sometimes lead to feelings of parnoia); intermittent tachycardia episodes; tremors; occasional OCD episodes; increase in pain level--and/or reduced effectiveness from narcotic pain meds; increased muscle spasms_ nausea,My review is identical for Nuvigil and Provigil: The medication is very effective for drowsiness and improved cognitive functioning; standard treatment for narcolepsy. However I am unable to maintain a daily schedule due to side effects: terrible headaches_ tremors_ negativity_ OCD_ and anxiety--Sometimes feeling watched or that people are working against me--even when I KNOW this isn't true. The combination makes me very irritable and not very nice to be around With daily use and higher doses I've experienced OCD episodes and panic attacks--probably triggered by physical anxiety_ which I've NEVER had before taking these meds.  It's terribly disappointing as hypersomia is ruining my life--NO one can get anything done sleeping. Worse_ when I take the nuvigil I either have to be selective as to when--so that my pain levels are relatively low--or up my narcotic due to increased pain and spasms.  Nuvigil & Provigil do what they are supposed to do_ but on balance the side effects are miserable_ even after years. With dr's permission I take them PRN--but they aren't as effective; So I live like Rip Van Winkle_ or suffer in pain and act like a nut_ pushing everyone away. I can't take anything sedating which means going without certain treatments.  Driving is out of the question.  I'm lucky that the narcotics don't sedate me (when sleeping 36 hrs I'm not taking anything let alone pain meds). Or eat. Or drink..Or let my poor dog out...FYI: Adderall and amphetamine were not helpful,F,59,  1X D,8/1/2015Email,Provigil
10, 2, MS fatigue,Took 3 weeks at 100mg before any noticeable effects. Upped dosage to 200mg at 4 weeks. Worked well for wakefulness_ but had increased anxiety and extreme irritability.,I'd rather be exhausted than awake and angry.,M,35,4  months200 mg,7/24/2015,Provigil
11, 5, Study aid,,No trouble getting to sleep when I wanted to. I have never experienced such high levels of focus and concentration as when I have been taking modafinil. The confidence it gave me when revising made me feel like nothing could stop me getting the grade I wanted. I would be getting through a workload five times as big as I could without it and just reading_ learning_ understanding and applying everything so very easily. Incredible drug. No side effects.,M,21,21  days200/400mg 1X D,7/4/2015,Provigil
12, 5, Narcolepsy,Not much. Probably contributes to my clenching teeth. I have a rapid heartbeat_ but I take Adderall too_ so can't blame it on the Provigil alone.,Provigil was a lifesaver. I initially started taking it due to sleepiness (they thought) from my Paxil. I had Tricare at the time so they covered it. After I divorced my military husband I got on a different insurance that required a pre-approval. That is when I had the sleep study and other testing and found I have narcolepsy. I actually take a combination of Provigil and Adderall. It is only 10mg of Adderall_ but something about the 2 together works amazingly.,F,44,10  years200 1X D,7/3/2015,Provigil

15, 5, Narcolepsy/Idiopathic Hypersomnia,My first week of taking the drug I experienced headaches and loss of appetite.  Those side effects faded and I have never had an issue with them again even going off and back on the drug.  I talk a little fast which might be a side effect but could be normal.,This drug is amazing for me.  I am not jittery_ I am not sleepy.  I can stop taking it any time I want to and will skip doses when I am sick so I can sleep more.  After careful discussion with my doctor I chose to continue taking it through my pregnancy and my son is perfectly healthy (I am not recommending this for everyone_ just offering the data since there is almost no information out there.  I would love to contribute my data to any research being done on this.).  I used ritalin while breastfeeding and prefer provigil because I had no side effects with it.  My biggest complaint is fighting my insurance every year.  The prior-authorization required for a drug I have been on for 10 years is insane and they mis-process the authorization all the time which leaves me rationing my pills and stressing out and calling everyone trying to find out who messed up.  I filed a grievance to see if I could get a waiver of the prior authorization requirement but they denied my request.,F,33,11  years400 1X D,4/10/2015Email,Provigil
16, 3, idiopathic  hypersomnia,Let me say to those out there that I had to fight w my insurance company all the way to a administrarive hearing level to get coverage. .. which I did  In the beginning_ and even still occasionally_ I get the shakes along w a headache and rapid speech. A few time some mild anxiety.,When I took provogil alone it did absolutely nothing.  Still falling asleep at dinner table face first into my plate.  Really. Dr. added adderall in late morning and a second dose around 2:30. Sometimes I glide right through the day with no problems; other days it seems I run from project to project and then back again_ barely completing any of them_  and then there are still other days that I feel as if the medication makes me more  drowsy.  For me it's a hit and miss.,F,51,6  months400 mg 2x,4/8/2015Email,Provigil

I gained it all back in 3 months.Im rethinking Provigil now.Maybe it goes weird when its in your system for too long? Is 6 years too long?,Its WONDERFUL at first.It starts very subtly_not like speed.It just seems like some ran a tab of estacy in a glass of water for like 3 seconds.But WONDERFUL! After 6 yers?

19, 1, Extreme fatigue,Rash_ all over. Started about an hour after taking. I would rather be tired all the time than deal with this rash. Took a claritin to try and calm it down.

20, 5, Bipolar Depression,Slight headache (only twice)_ diminished appetite,I have bipolar disorder and I used this while on Prozac. Prozac had got me out of the worst of a depressive episode_ but I still felt flat and with a mood that was always just below normal.  Modafinil made me feel slightly high_ properly awake_ and very motivated.  In other words_ it really worked for the depression_ and there were no scary side effects -  no mania_ no anxiety_ no risktaking behaviour_ no agitation_ no raised heartbeat or any 'speedy' effects. Also there was no sharp comedown - the effects just gradually wear off. The only negative effect a mild headache on two occasions and one paracetamol solved it. It makes you feel more mentally alert_ but I did not notice any increase in physical energy. The effect started within half an hour of taking 100mg and reached a peak about 2 hours later. The effects last for at least 12 hours_ so don't take it late in the day if you want to sleep. I took 200mg once and the effects were just a bit more intense and lasted at least 15 hours. After it wears off_ appetite and sleep return to normal_ and the next morning I felt normal.  I don't take it every day_ just when I feel I need it. I have not tried this when deeply depressed_ only when I was coming out of a depression_ so I can't say how it would work in that case. It certainly works in changing your mood from slightly low to slightly high.,F,55,30  days100 to 200 1X D,12/12/2014Email,Provigil
21, 4, Shift work disorder,At first lethargy_ headaches_ feeling of living in a fog with little to no emotions.,"After the initial ""trial"" period I have enjoyed provigil.

22, 3, sleep apnea_ grad school,"This medication is very peculiar. I think diet affects it_ because the side effects and overall efficiency change from day to day for me. I am definitely more alert_ and when I ""crash"" at night_ I fall asleep much more quickly. However_ I feel more anxious and slightly depressed using this medication. Also_ if I am very stressed (say_ having a big paper due)_ the anxious side effects are hightened to the point I am physically shaking. On the whole_ I am happy with the medication_ I just dislike the frequency of the side effects.",,F,33,1  months200mg,12/9/2014,Provigil

Am able to follow thru on tasks better and none of the side effects of ritalin eg. nervousness_ tremors etc). Note: my MD has prescribed 200 in morning_ which I take as very first thing before shower_ dressing etc  and a half tablet (100mg) by 2 or 3 in the afternoon if needed and I am still able to sleep at night.I do some shift work and long shifts (12-14 hrs) and this is a Godsend!

31, 3, Study enhancement for nursing schoo,I took modafinil so I could do well in nursing school. This pill is a miracle and aweful at the same time. I am horrible at math and learned almost an entire nursing calculations book in one week on my own. I have problems focusing and getting motivated. On modafinil I was so determined I would study for 15 hours straight time would fly by it was enjoyable and the material was easy for me to pick up and master. I also loved that I had zero appetite because I wanted to lose a few pounds. I lost 3 lbs in one week. I could go two days without eating and not affect me or have zero hunger pains I would have to force myself to eat. However_ on the 7th day of taking it my personality and thought process completely changed I didn't feel like myself at all! I did things and thought things completely out of character. I woke up with serious depression and anxiety (no previous history of that ever in the past) I'm not talking about feeling a little down or a minor knot in my stomach I'm talking hated life questioning everything gut-renching knot panic attack. I had uncontrollable crying for hours straight_ having a panic attack to the point where I was really struggling to breath_ couldn't focus_ mind racing_ racing heart (pulse rate was 138 resting) all while throwing up all day long. First day not taking it I feel a little better still have some anxiety and feeling down. I hope this isn't permanent because I absolutely can't stand this feeling.

Since taking Modafinil my ability to concentrate has increased_ analyticsl skills improved dramatically and mood is happy. I also like that there is no big ""speedy high"" and no overheating or sweating too much unlike Dextroamphetamines. Downside to Modafinil is that my productivity has decreased_ awake time & energy is decreased_  social life decreased and I obsess and overanalyze things way too much. Great if I want to be a professional recluse analyzing data all day but my career and life require me to be more social & awake.

40, 3, M.E. / sleeping issues / narcalepsy,I have battled with M.E./ extreme fatigue for 16 years. After having a child_ I needed to address and increase my wakefulness. At first I took 100mg at 8/9am_ and if I needed a boost_ another 100mg at 10am. This would wouldn't wake me up as expected_ but rather i would force myself to get going and then it would kick in. It would send me on a cleaning frenzy and did lower ones inhibitions. I soon started to notice that i couldn't settle at night_(hence me writing this now) and would become emotionally overwhelmed and low. I dropped the dose to 100mg a day if I had work_ which did help me_ but it was a struggle. I soon developed horrific migraines after i lowered the frequency of taking them. (twice a week for work or if i had a 'busy' day). I found if i took 50mg every couple of days_ and then 100mg on busy days_ it kept the head aches/migraines at bay. However_ part of my thinks this clashes with the Pill_ Yasmin. Since alternating days and lowering the dosage_ I don't get low moods_head aches and only mild palpitations. Though i still have trouble getting to sleep_ which resets the cycle if you like_ you need another pill to get up! I would advise NOT TO DRINK CAFFEINE AS WELL. This will heighten all side effects and give you the shakes and jumbled words/thinking. It is a life line to me_ but the side effects are many and do suck. Though i can honestly say_ i don't find it addictive. Its one to try and giggle about with a docs advice i think.,,F,28,2  years100-150mg,3/27/2014Email,Provigil

45, 4, Idiopathic Hypersomnia,Headaches_ Loss of Appetite_ Increased Thirst_ Chattiness,I take one 200mg pill of Provigil in the morning_ and it gives me a slight headache (which I can easily endure) and I can hear and feel my heart pounding when I am quiet. It works great when keeping me awake until about mid-afternoon after lunch. I then try to fight to stay awake. Will eat a snack or force myself to walk around_ or taking a regular vitamin-B pill will sometimes do the trick. I noticed though that if I drink coffee while on Provigil_ it gives me a more severe headache. The drug has made me more chatty and outgoing_ which annoys the person with whom I work closest and I may be a bit overbearing for some_ but others like chatty people_ so who knows. When I first started taking Provigil_ I took two (400mg) pills in the morning and one (200mg) pill around noon.  This was too much for me.  I was hyper and talked fast the first few days_ but by the end of that week_ I was lethargic.  I felt no emotion and had a more severe headache.  It felt dark.  It was a bit scarey_ so I pulled back and now just take the one pill in the morning.  Even though I still get a bit sleepy in the afternoon_ it's better than having to deal with the severe headache and lethargic feeling of the higher dose. I struggled with depression/suicidal thoughts at times while on Provigil these past months. Those went away after I prayed with another person.

It's AMAZING for fatigue and depression. I normally spend all morning yawning_ but never when I take Provigil. I feel energetic and have a better mood. However_ sometimes I have noticed that I become really chatty_ somewhat arrogant/obnoxious when I am talking to other people. It can make you irritable at times. I lost 15 pounds in 2 months due to lack of appetite (a plus for me). I get severe headaches 1-2 times per week I never had before. Plus it makes hormonal contraception less effective. So_ I am trying to determine if the positive outweighs the negatives of this drug. I love the energy and alertness_ along with weight loss_ but the other side effects really suck. I don't have any sex drive anymore and that is hurting my marriage. I may reduce my intake to ""as needed"" basis instead of everyday.",F,36,60  days200 1X D,9/16/2013,Provigil
49, 1, fatigue for MS,Nausea when it first kicks in_ no other effects until it starts to wear off then I felt jittery_ shaky_ irritable and sweaty,I had to fight so hard to get this prescription after my insurance initially refused to pay for it. Even still my co-pay for a two-week supply was $98 for the generic.I was so disappointed to find that this did absolutely nothing! I literally got no benefits from it whatsoever. I couldn't even tell I was taking anything_ except that I was a little nauseous and had heartburn during the first couple hours. It started to wear off about 5 hours after I took it and I was extremely jittery and shaky_ felt like I would pass out_ started sweating all over and felt really irritable. Maybe it was just because I took the generic_ but this drug was absolutely worthless for me. It's definitely not worth about $200 a month even with insurance.,F,39,5  days100 1X D,9/7/2013Email,Provigil

I can get up take my provigil and walk my dog go out with my husband clean the house shop visit family things other people do.  I still at times fall asleep but not as often.  It is very frustrating to fall asleep even if for a short period of 5 to 10 mins.  You miss alot.  Furthermore the sleep paralyzation does not happen as often if I take my medicine.   I can work maybe 5hours a day now.  It has really improved my quality of life.  I hate that it is so expensive because I really need the medicine to be a productive part of society.

I did feel better than before_ but while Provigil was able to give me the PHYSICAL energy to stay awake_ I still felt mentally drained most of the time_ had a hard time concentrating as usual_ and wanted to sleep even though I didn't feel the urgent NEED to fall asleep. I still found myself having to supplement with caffeine. It was semi-helpful_ but not what I had expected_ and at such a low dose_ I wouldn't really consider it effective.

58, 3, narcolepsy,Itchy rash on arms and legs,I had taken Provigil several years ago for a span of about 3 months. Although it was a great alternative for my narcolepsy_ it was not generic and quite expensive.I opted for Concerta instead. Now that Provigil is generic (Modafinil)_ I began taking it again over a month ago. Not a single side effect at first and I as very alert with a natural feeling of wakefulness. Last week I developed a symmetrical rash on my forearms. The next day it had spread slightly and I applied hydrocortisone cream which helped a little. With each passing day_ the rash continued to spread and increased in intensity ( a maddening itch). Currently_ it is on my arms from the elbows to my wrists and on my legs from the knees to ankles. Oddly enough it feels as though I'm itching from the inside out! I stopped taking the med after 5 days of having the rash. I will be going back to Concerta. Nuvigil did not work for me (stomach discomfort)_ but it has helped my 16 year old daughter.,F,37,6  weeks200mg 2X D,1/4/2013,Provigil
59, 5, Hypersomnia_ ADHD (adult),I started this drug as a 19 year old for ADHD and initially had to stop it based on tachycardia (increased pulse). I went back on it four years later as I was diagnosed with hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness). No longer had the tachycardia side effect. It is what I would consider my miracle drug. Doesn't work too much for ADHD but for promoting wakefulness it great (for me). Also_ was on it in different doses ranging from 200-400mg a day (once at 200mg/day once_ and once at 200mg BID). Also have been on 300mg/day. 200mg generally works ok.,"Most recently in order to get approval for the med as my current insurance companies deny it_ I have to be off of it for two weeks to get a sleep study during the night and day. I've been off for three days and all I do is sleep. It's a bit ridiculous because when someone has hypertension_ he or she isn't asked to discontinue a blood pressure medication long-term to ""prove"" it. I barely function and sleep most of the day off of it. Also_ you can order from Canadian pharmacies online and they obtain it from India for a way cheaper price if your insurance company disapproves it_ just make sure to have an Rx.",F,26,3  years200-400mg 1X D,12/17/2012,Provigil

Almost no appetite.  Increased focus and could get tons of things done.  Terrible crash though when it wore off.,My psych HATES caffeine and he prescribed me this when I mentioned the first thing I do after waking was start the coffee maker.  Had to get prior authorization every year bc my insurance hated this medication.  The headaches became a huge problem_ and once had to leave work early after snapping at fellow employees for just talking (but sounded like everything around me was amplied 100-fold).  Tolerance increased VERY fast_ and my doctor had to continue to increase my dose and quantity.  Finally got fed up and quit this drug in Sept 2012.

I noticed that when I take a whole one in the morning (200 mg) I sometimes feel a slight headache_but quite tolerable and like my body is racing by afternoon - but not in a bad way.,I consider this a miracle drug as it has helped me daily with focusing and energy both as an educator and as  a graduate student. When I don't take it_ I get very tired around mid morning or noon and I remember that I had not taken the medicine.

64, 5, Major Depression,Early a little increases anxiety but not overwhelming.,"I have tried 4 antidepressants Lexapro_Remeron_Wellbutrin and I am currently on Zoloft and Lamictal which keep me slightly above the bottom. My days are usually full of heavy depression related tiredness. The Dr prescribed me Dextroamphetamine 10mgs to take on the bad days. This gave me immediate results knocking out the depression the day I take it and the positive effects lasted up to 2 days after taking it. He said I could just stay on it but since it is addictive perhaps Provigil would work as well on a daily basis. I started the first 2 days on 50mgs and it worked beautifully keeping me alert and depression free. On the 3rd day it did not feel as effectve so I upped it to 100Mgs first thing in the morning at 6AM on an empty stomach and within 1 hour I am alert and feeling great. This is an expensive drug with no US generic. My insurance will not cover it. I buy the generic overseas ""Modinifil"" for a fraction of what the brand name sells for here. It worked the same as the Provigil samples I got from the DR. THis is not an approved med for depression which is a shame.

Rather than use a sleeping pill_ I tried modafinil to wake myself up.No systematic effect on hunger.Incredibly effective if short of sleep for a day or two.Very productive_ brain very clear - things that had puzzled me got sorted very quickly (maths stuff!) and raced through design and analysis (I'm an engineer).Some mood lift_ not manic_ definitely more sociable and positive.

(A short nap clears the head and then you need to force yourself to go to bed at a sensible time!)I find 100mg will dispel my usual tendancy to doze off (or most of it)_ 200 is nice_ 400 does get a bit manic_ I suppose that's when the stimulant effects st",M,62,90  days200mg 1X D,12/29/2011Email,Provigil

It would be nice to sit and relax without feeling a nap is necessary.  I go back to the doctor in January_ but am considering calling sooner.

I have also noticed that when I work out a couple times a week a smaller dose is required to do the same job and for what ever reason the weight seems to come off faster.

101, 5, MS,Tinnitus and jitters.,I've been taking Provigil for 2 years. It's helped me a lot. I also take Baclofen for tremor but the side-effects add to my MS Fatigue and I have trouble doing anything. I recently upped my dosage from 200 MG to 400 MG per day and I've noticed tinnitus (noticed! It's hard not to notice - but it's worth it.),M,46,1  months100 MG 4X D,9/25/2010Email,Provigil
102, 4, Idiopathic Hypersomnia,Appetite suppresant_ bowell movement w/in 30 min of taking_ Dry mouth,I can't function without taking Provigil. I had to stop taking it when I was pregnant and nursing. During that time_ my boss thought I was severely depressed and hated my life. In reality_ I was just constantly battling to stay awake. Like someone else said_ you feel sedated- fighting your hardest to stay awake. I hate to rely on meds to function in life_ but it's not an option. The only problem I'm having now is that the effects aren't as long lasting. My neurologist added Adderall to my daily routine_ but I can't tell a difference- besides the loss of appetite (which I like). Provigil used to get me through at least the work day_ but now it only lasts a couple of hours before I'm falling asleep at my desk again. Without taking the entire daily dose in the morning_ I can't fully wake up_ which leaves me struggling by 10am. So I take another one to get through another couple hours_ even though it's not prescribed at that dosage. It does have a sudden stopping affect_ not a slow come down. I've noticed when I don't take it_ I eat everything in site all day long...when I'm not sleeping. Right now I'm praying for a miracle drug_ because I don't want to reach the max dose for this and it not work anymore.,F,32,9  years200 MG 2X D,9/23/2010Email,Provigil
103, 3, narcolepsy,Increase in headaches_ tremmors_ I have a lot of gastrointestonal issues and other problems so I have no idea if it's related to the med or not_ but the headaches and tremmors are deffinately new with the med.,First I have to say I absolutely can't function without the med.  To give an example it feels as if I've been sedated and am trying to fight going to sleep.  However aside from the side effects of this med_ I started out with 200 mg once a day but at around 2 every day I would just crash.  I'd go from being ok_ to in an instant not able to function. So now I take two a day (dr. ordered).  Still I hate how it doesn't just wear off slowly_ it_ just stops working suddenly.  Sometimes it doesn't work at all_ but that's just me I guess. So can barely live with it but can't live without it.,F,36,1.5  years200 2X D,9/9/2010,Provigil
104, 1, chronic fatigue,Minor Rash on the forearms_ extreme headaches,I took the generic brand Modalert. I found it to be generally ineffective when taken by mouth. Taken in the morning I would develop severe headaches later in the day. Eventually I progressed to snorting 100mg of the drug at night time. Snorting the drug was the only way to experience its effects for me. This improved my problem with fatigue and allowed me to get more done after work_ It did not keep me up at night. Until I got a rash on my arm. A common side effect of Modafinil is skin rash_ which can lead to Steven Johnsons Syndrome. Your skin starts to peel off until you look like a burn victim. Fortunately this is a rare occurrence_ and now that I have gotten my first rash I have decided to stop taking it. I would say that this drug is too dangerous to mess with. Unless you really have narcolepsy like Mr. Bean in the movie Rat Race. If you're just feeling tired_ drink coffee instead. It's better to be tired than have your skin melt off your face and go blind. Again_ SJS is a rare occurrence_ but you have a much better chance of getting it by taking drugs you don't need.,M,25,2  months100mg 1X D,9/7/2010Email,Provigil

109, 3, Narcolepsy,Question about alcohol warning and drug holidays:Does anyone know why you are not suppose to drink alcohol while taking provigil?  Are drug holidays recommended with Provigil?,Today is my first day of taking Provigil_ so I am hopeful that it will help me.  I noticed the alcohol warning but can find no explanation for it.  Prior to this I have been taking 60 mg Ritalin daily to stay awake.  Ritalin comes with an alcohol warning as well but the pharmacist told me I could have a glass or wine or beer once in a while.  The concern is mixing large amounts of alcohol with amphetamines.  Drug Holidays: Like any other drug resistance was a concern with the Ritalin.  To counter this drug holidays were a routine exercise. Essentially one day a week_ or a few days in a row every couple of weeks with no medication so that you don't become resistant to the benefits and can stay on a lower dosage.  My dosage was pretty high (the max. recommended).  I am wondering if the same thing is common with the Provigil. If it isn't it might help with when the effectiveness seems to fade.,F,45,1  days200 1X D,8/10/2010Email,Provigil
110, 4, Attention/concentration issues,Gouging my wallet.  This drug costs more than street drugs_ it's criminal what they charge.  No negative side effects from the drug other than the occasional nervousness_ usually remedied by consuming less caffeine.,I started Providgil 3 months back to treat my ADD/concentration issues.  I was originally put on Ritilan in 5th grade and then went on Adderall and Dexedrine in high school and college.  I had substance abuse problems that were exacerbated by these meds and eventually had to come off everything and get clean.  Now_ 6 years later_ still clean and sober I found my attention issues to be an issue again.  I first tried Strattera which was a completely bogus drug.  It made my symptoms worse_ and had *several* unpleasant side effects.  I tried Wellbutrin which worked great for a while_ but stopped it after the max dose started to lose its effect.  I reluctantly started on Providgil 3 months ago_ I stayed away from it because it was a controlled substance.  Now that I've been on it for 3 months I'm having difficulty understanding why it's controlled.  It definitely wakes you up but doesn't provide a ton of euphoria.  I honestly felt more euphoric on wellbutrin(which isn't controlled).  Bottom line is the drug worked really well for me at first_ but it's starting to lose its efficacy; just like everything else...And I'm at the max dose of 600mg a/day.  My doctor is suggesting adding Wellbutrin back in to the mix_ so we will see.  I'm curious if anyone else has had a similar experience_ I'm doing whatever I can to avoid anything in the ritian/amphetamine class of drugs.  I will also add that regular exercise and a diet low in carbohydrates high in protein have helped a lot too.,M,30,3  months300 2X D,7/27/2010Email,Provigil

113, 2, Excessive Daytime Sleepiness,Stomach Bloating_ brain fog about 1/2 hour after taking it which goes away eventually.,"I was first diagnosed with Narcolepsy (sp?) over 25 years ago. I was given 5 mg. of Desoxyn at the time. Desoxyn is the best meds ever made in my opinion. I also found out later I have attention deficit. The Desoxyn was my cure all. And _ I might add it was _ at the time 3 dollars and something out of my pocket. For the whole prescription.NOW_ my faithful family doctor retired. So my new doctor prefers to have me take Provigil. THANK GOD I have a prescription card! I only pay 18dollars. Mt poor prescription plan has to pay 1_000 and something a month.!!And all 800mg. doesn't come close to what the 5mg. desoxyn did.

When you walk in a room and wonder why you did? or try to think what for? Or you just sit there ..thinking? After that goes away. Yes_ you DO stay awake. But it's like your eyes are just staying open. Rarely _ I'll feel decent enough to tackle a ""real"" job in the house. I called the company and told them _ For this price it should jump out of the bottle and clean my house for me.lol! It's better than nothing! Otherwise I would sleep my life away. Also_ I take 2 18mg. of Concerta a day to ""curb"" the ""Ozzie"" effect which I hate. Personally_ I feel the Desoxyn was much safer and more effective and resonably priced.

It has been the only drug that has changed my thinking patterns & increased motivation to create (music). I have done outrageous things on Provigil_ which fall into the Bipolar list - like walk out on a performance - or upbraid a priest in public. With experience_ and therapy_ skills_ you can learn to control the ""over the top"" feelings. If I feel it waning_ I may stop it for a few days_ or break the pill in half. The withdrawal is like this: falling down a mental staircase. It is not nearly as unpleasant as coming off an SSRI. I have stopped the med many times_ and felt fine for up to 1 month. I felt after 1 month that an additional drop occurs_ since I've tried this many times. I begin to wonder if permanent changes have been made to my brain chemistry: or long term changes_ at least. This is an effective agent to help with suicidal urges. It is sad that so many people feel these urges in our modern age.

If it is believed that you have bipolar mood disorder or mania_ or a personality disorder_ do not take this drug.  If you are depressed or chronically fatigued_ I recommend this drug on working or busy mornings at critical times only_ just to take the edge off the fatigue.

Sometimes even with 1 Ambien CR 12.5mg added to keep me asleep.,Needless to say I was not alert most of the time (except during that first few hours in the moring when I first took Provigil.)  By noon time I was miserable_ aching all over_ headach_ chest pain and feeling anxious. Just a normal dose of a benzo had no effect nor did a commonly perscribed sleeping perscribed pill.

I had seen around twenty different doctors before I was diagnosed and given Provigil/Modafinil (200mg). My wife says it is like I have come back from the dead. I do not ""feel"" the effect of this medicine.  It is not like drinking a soda pop and feeling the caffine work (or eating a lot of sugar).  For me_ it does not ""kick-in"".  But it works. I find myself staying awake during the day_ and doing things. However_ after two weeks_ the effect started wearing off.  I started taking naps and going for the sugar and caffeine.  A month and a half after I started 200mg_ the doctor raised the dosage over a number of weeks to 600mg a day.  The medicine started working again_ but after 400mg I couldn't tell much difference in wakefulness.  As the dosage increased (by 100mg a week)_ I also noticed that I started waking up earlier and earlier.  From 9:30am to 8:30am to 7:45am. I expected a lot from this medicine_ and it has proven itself. Sadly_ it has not been enough.  The next step is to add other medications on top of this.

Provigil keeps me awake for about 18 hours_ and I have a decreased appetite.  The first 2 months taking Provigil_ I lost 40 lbs.

Clear of this drug for about 3 weeks now. I suffered extreme withdrawal (flu like symptoms) when I was unable to take the drug.  After the withdrawal_ depression I did not know I had lifted_ my thinking process became clear and short term memory loss improved. I thought I had ADD and sought psyc help a yr ago. I almost lost my job and missed out on two separate promotions I did not feel qualified for at the time_ all because of this drug.

I was diagnosed with mixed (central and obstructive) sleep apnea_ and faithfully wore my CPAP device to the prescribed levels with little improvement in my symptoms.  I was diagnosed with borderline narcolepsy after a 24 hour stay at a sleep lab_ and was put on provigil. Prior to provigil_ I would regularly fall asleep at work or in meetings. I was afraid to drive alone for more than an hour for fear that I would fall asleep driving. (I had many close calls!). I have never felt any euphoria as described by others.

When I first started taking it_ I only took 100mg once a day.  It seemed to do the trick. If I knew I was going to be doing something that would keep me up late_ I would take a full dose of 200mg.  A couple of years ago_ I just started taking a full dose--thinking that more would be more wakefulness. Never noticed any side effects until December 2009. All of a sudden my Blood pressure that had been controlled with medication for 6+ years was running high and my resting pulse would be 90-100 beats per minute.  I couldn't sleep because I could hear my heart beating in my ears most of the time.  I was also anxious and would have panic attacks.  My MD told me to reduce the dose to 100mg and see what happened.  I stopped taking the Provigil all together thinking I would rather be tired than feel the way I had been feeling.

137, 4, MS fatigue,Intense Headaches_ migraine type_ Pain in right eye and side of face like my migraines. but sometimes no headache!!  It's a wonder drug that gets me out of bed and allows me to have a normal day of being productive.   I take it when I really have to do something_ like go out at night or else I do'nt take it.  No other bad side effects except difficult to fall asleep_ so I just take 1/2 of the 200 mg pill or 1/4 . BEen taking it for years but very infrequently as stated above. Lately a little more because it does give one energy to exercise_ etc.which is important for MS patients and well anyone to do!!  Lifts mood a bit_ but the headaches when they occur_ are bad!!,,F,59, 100 1X D,2/21/2010,Provigil
138, 5, Restless leg syndrome_ sleepiness,headaches 1st few weeks; wake earlier than normal_ but still feel refreshed; more vivid dreams; slight anxiety at 200mg_ but fine with 100mg/day,I was diagnosed with Restless Legs Syndrome_ which remains untreated because I can't tolerate the meds (made me compulsive/manic).  I am a computer programmer and almost lost my job because I could not stay awake in the afternoons and could not focus at all.  I was so tired in the evenings that just making dinner for my family was a huge effort.  Provigil allows me to function normally_ do my job well_ and still get a decent night's sleep.  I wake up earlier than normal_ but I seem to need less sleep.  I used to sleep 9 hours and still feel tired -- now I get by fine on 7 or 8.  An occasional headache was the only annoying side effect_ but I rarely get those now. I took the prescribed 200mg for a day or two_ but it made me anxious so I cut back to 1/2 pill and it works great.  On weekends I skip it altogether.  My advice is to start at a lower dose and work up to what works for you.  If you have a serious reaction or are on a million other drugs_ then maybe its not for you_ but it did save my job_ and my family is deeply grateful that I'm back to my upbeat_ energetic self.,F,45,1  years100mg 1X D,2/20/2010,Provigil

140, 5, Fatigue related to sleep apnea,Bruxism (grinding teeth)_ motormouth,Provigil is outstanding if taken correctly.  I take 100mg on awakening in the morning and 50-100mg at noon - none after that.  32 years of type 1 insulin dependent diabetes has resulted in constant fatigue and occasional depression for which I use Lexapro 10mg once daily which also causes drowsiness.  Last May_ my doctor prescribed Provigil.  The first two months produced pure euphoria to the point that I looked forward to getting up early in the morning to take it.  I gained so much energy and ambition that I built an addition on my house.  I am disabled/retired due to diabetes. To avoid insomnia_ I don't take Provigil after noon and since it has only a 6 hour half-life_ it's at a low level by night.  I take 0.25 mg (1/2 tab) of clonazepam before bed for restless leg syndrome (developed many years before taking Provigil) and sleep like a baby.The euphoria is long gone and I'm taking a larger dose than when I started due to some tolerance developing. On occasion_ I will stop taking it for 4-5 days without withdrawal symptoms just to clear my system. Bruxism has always been a problem for me and Provigil has made it worse.  On Provigil vs. Nuvigil. Provigil will become generic next year and_ by making an inconsequential change in chemistry_ the blood suckers created a new prescription drug_ Nuvigil that will fill their coffers for the next seven years.  When Provigil goes generic_ buy it instead of Nuvigil and save $.,M,64,10  months100 mg 2X D,2/12/2010,Provigil

142, 4, sleeping too much - hypersomnia,Often unable to get into a deep sleep; less appetite (thankfully).  Stimulants aren't for everyone - be careful.,My doctor told me to take half the dose but I forgot & took the full dose for 1 week - which made me jittery_ and I didn't sleep well.  I cut it in half & that helped the next week.  But that still seemed too much_ so since then_ I now take 1/4 the dose (cutting the pill isn't easy)_ and that seems to be the right amount for me.  I have always needed a lot of sleep_ but now I am functioning very well on this dosage & very pleased with the results.  Provigil may not be for everyone but that is why YOU need to discuss any issues with YOUR MEDICAL DOCTOR.  Sometimes it's just a matter of deciding if the benefits outweigh the downsides.  I am glad it has worked for me!  It hasn't eliminated all the sleepiness ... yawning throughout the afternoon still_ but has eliminated the excessive sleeping for me.,F,43,1  months,1/26/2010,Provigil

The effect was the opposite of what I wanted.   I felt dull and disconnected a slight headache.  It was not a good experience.   DAY 2:  Broke up the 200mg dose into two 100mg doses_ one at 6:30 the second at 12:30.  The experience was good.  I had none of the ""dull and disconnected"" feeling I had experience on the prior day.  While I had energy_ I didnt feel over stimulated.  The only symptom to remain was a slight feeling of ""dry eye"".  However_ it was very minor.  My ability to focus and stay on task was noticeably improved.  No noticeable drop-off_ or crash.

I really look for this medication to be prescribed more for depression and fatigue.,Different drugs work differently for different people. I highly recommend this drug.

Five hours later_ finally felt nice surge of energy that lasted throughout the eve. Weird and unpleasant dreams that night. I skipped a day_ then took another 100 mg dose 2nd morning. This time no disconnected feeling_ no energy surge_ just loose stools_ mild nausea and muscle stiffness. By nighttime was sneezing with runny nose and congestion. I didn't connect any of this to the Provigil--assumed it didn't work and that it was time to up my dosage to the rec. 200 mg. So today_ day 3_ I took 200mg in the morn. w/ breakfast and coffee.

I felt sweaty_ it seemed like my heart was racing (I have high BP)_ and the worst was the late afternoon crash I would experience everyday at 3 pm; I would be so drained I could barely finish my work day_ which defeated the entire purpose of taking the medication.  I also had a terrible rash on my face (my eye almost swelled shut)_ neck_ and arms. At the time I blamed the rash on possible poison ivy since I had weeded the lawn_ but now I'm not so sure. My face was also breaking out severely_ and I had alway had a beautiful complexion. I stopped taking it when I ran out after 30 days.  In about another month I re-filled it_ wanting to give it another try since it did help initially_ and I had lost weight as a bonus.  This time it worked for only a day or 2 before the negative outweighed the positive effects_ not to mention the $50 co-pay.

I initially took it for 2 years at age 20-21. I was unable to continue when I lost my health insurance. Due to this I went without medication and by the time I had medical coverage again I did not want any record of my ""disability"" and decided to go without it. I remained unmedicated for the next 8 years. EDS and Hypnagogic Hallucinations were my primary symptoms. Unmedicated it required constant napping and over the counter stimulants to remain awake although rarely alert. When I feared that the condition would negatively impact my career I made the decision to return to the medication building up to my present amount of 100mg in the morning and 100mg at noon. I found that it caused severe anxiety during the daily withdrawl period (5-10pm) but allowed me to be very tired by bed time. The effect on my impulsivity and temper have been trying to manage but still manageable. I see many people here have very extreme side effects but many of them are taking doses that I can't even comprehend. I have moderate to severe narcolepsy with very extreme EDS and 200mg is enough to keep me bouncing my leg all day.

I am 51 yrs. old and have been lethargic and sleepy all my life. Never even considered being tested for narcolepsy untill about 2 yrs. ago. I have all the classic signs except for 1 so they labeled me as having hypersomnia. Idiopathic just means they don't really know ""why"". It's just a doctors way of sounding intelligent when they really do not have a clue.Anyway_ provigil works for me without all the increased heart rate or the ""high"" feeling.",F,51,1  years,6/13/2009Email,Provigil

Everyone on this board knows how frustrating our sleep issues have been from first trying to understand why we were so sleepy and not being able to stay awake - to going from doctor to doctor being told to exercise regularly and eat more sensibly and that will solve sleeping 15 hours a day.

181, 2, To increase cognitive functions,CAUTION!!! Provigil was extremely addicting for me and I was unable to only take the proscribed amount.  I experienced dry mouth_ trouble swallowing_ upset stomach_ trouble sleeping_ strained jaw_ loss of appetite and weird feeling.,I have an addicting personality.  If something makes me feel good I just want to take more and more of it.  Provigil was a pleasurable stimulant which was used to help me regain clarity from the fog of other meds I was taking.  I have taken Provigil on and off over the last few years.  I could never stay on it consistently because I would start abusing it within days of starting back on it.  This last time I ordered Provigil online from India because I don't have insurance.  Before that I hadn't taking it for about one and a half years.  It was delivered about two weeks ago.  The first day I ended up taking 1200mg!  The side effects I mentioned became very present and the next 24 hours were miserable.  After a couple more failed attempts at managing Provigil I just flushed the rest. I'll never take provigil again_ in my case the bad far out weighted the good.,M,28, ,6/10/2009,Provigil
182, 3, many years of narcolepsy,Itchy scalp and lots of hair fell out within a couple weeks of starting meds. Increased frequency of headaches.,"Although I was alarmed at how much of my hair fell out_ Provigil helped me function so much better -- fending off the previously irresistible drowsiness_ so I could drive safely_ and improved my ability to focus and work productively -- that I felt its good points outweighed the disadvantages.However_ when my insurance stopped covering it for a few months_ it was so costly that I had to give it up for a while. The withdrawal was exhausting.  When coverage resumed_ and I restarted the Provigil_ a lot more hair fell out and broke off; but_ since I needed to function safely_ I accepted that loss.  When the insurance interrupted coverage again (""doughnut hole"" -- a rip-off to discuss in a different forum)_ once more I had to adjust to life without the meds.  So_ I've decided to stay off it for now because it's too hard on my system to keep adjusting to the on & off coverage.",F,61,3  years,5/21/2009Email,Provigil

The absolute urge to take a nap is much less_ and this is a welcome feeling after 25 years of wanting to crash all the time. It does not completely get rid of the urge to sleep during the day_ but makes it more tolerable. I feel awful from it at the moment_ because I drank too much coffee this morning along with the medication.  I won't be doing that again_ as I don't like the current feeling at the moment. Basically_ each day I have felt differently on this med. Doc gave me 7 samples of Provigil and will be switching to Ritalin for cost reasons.,F,38,5  days,5/18/2009,Provigil

190, 3, depression_ sleepiness,mild headache first few days_ intensified depression,The main reason my doctor prescribed Provigil was that I have extreme morning sleepiness and lack of energy. I've been on Cymbalta for over 2 years_ but at the dose I tolerate best it doesn't completely relieve the depression. I started Provigil at 1/3 of a 200 mg tablet (approx. 67 mg) for 10 days_ and then increased to 1/2 (100 mg) per doctor's instructions. The first two or three days on Provigil I did have increased energy and motivation_ and although that faded somewhat after a week or so I did feel more alert. Some nights I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep_ and my sleep schedule became erratic because I would stay up very late until I became sleepy. Earlier this week_ after having taken Provigil for about 1 month_ I became extremely depressed_ anxious_ and tearful. I didn't link it to Provigil until I read the comments of others who have had a similar experience. I had also noticed that I was talking a lot_ which is out of character for me_ but I didn't link that to the Provigil_ either_ until I read other patients' comments. My doctor has taken me off Provigil and increased the Cymbalta. I may try it again at a low dose because I need some relief from the sleepiness/fatigue_ which has returned full force.,F,54,1  months,5/2/2009,Provigil
191, 5, Narcolepsy,Decreased effectiveness if taken consistently. Occasional headaches. Panic attacks if I mix high doses with other stimulants. Insomnia if taken after noon. Anxiety with dose of 200mg or more.,This medicine is a life-saver for me. Taking it keeps me from falling asleep in classes_ airports_ at work_ or while eating_ but 100 mg doesn't disrupt my sleep cycle at all. It helps me concentrate and keeps my thoughts from wandering off as often_ too. Taking it has made me a much better student without negative psychological effects.,F,19,3  years,5/1/2009,Provigil

When i first took this pill i was in love with it_ i thought i found the missing link to how to live life normally. I was constantly tired_ sleeping all day if i could_ but then i could not sleep at night. The first few weeks i took as perscribed 200 mg a day_ then i felt it was not enough and begged to get perscribed 400mg a day_ which is rare for someone to take and the most a doctor legally can perscribe. From then on i was hooked_ taking 5- 7 pills a day which would back fire more and more as time went on_ but it was impossible for me to stop cause i couldnt get out of bed anymore without it. i eventually had to sleep two days straight to get off it . . i would consider this a legal herion when it comes to how quick a person can get hooked on it. i believe this because being constantly tired all the time no matter who you are_ makes a person feel hopeless in life and depressed_ we try eveything but nothing works_ we eny others who can live life normally_ then we find something that can actually give us the enegy we believe everyone else possesses normally - but its a lie. i would take the way i feel now over provigil anyday. i cant even eblieve who i turned into _ i almost lost my child. and my home just because of my behavior_ i am completely sane and i found myself on easter upstairs at my parents talking to "" ghoasts"" i could only see through reflextions or shadows_ but",F,23,1  years,4/30/2009Email,Provigil

197, 1, fatigue from  MS & MS medications,"The horrible side effect_ after about four years' of use_ was hypomania_ which I didn't associate with the Provigil_ and which became full-blown mania within the next year.  Early side effects_ which I'd been managing_ seemed related to getting the dose correct to allow normal sleep -- after the first month or two_ I ended up going for many months being awake 36 hours_ sleeping 6 hours until I ""mixed and matched"" a lower dose of Provigil with a high dose of Celexa antidepressant at neurologist's and psychopharmacologist's suggestion","I wouldn't take Provigil over a long period of time.  I began taking it after enrolling in a double blind study of Tysabri_ a then-new MS drug given by infusion.  I thought I was getting the Tysabri_ not a placebo_ because the first infusion knocked me on my ass so much that I couldn't get out of bed for three days. (It did turn out to be the Tysabri.)  Hence the Provigil prescription.  Once the balancing of the dose seemed to be settled_ I didn't see any problem with it.  About four or so years into its use_ I began having intrusive_ running thoughts that prevented sleep.  Others with MS said it sounded like mania_ which can come with the MS_ and which is treatable.  My doctor said it was hypomania_ gave me some Ambien_ and it went away on its own after only two nights of Ambien -- or did it?  I could sleep_ but without me really being aware of it_ I wasn't even thinking about sleeping_ and I wasn't tired.  When I did sleep_ I wasn't being kept awake by racing thoughts_ so all seemed well.  Wrong.  I ended up with full-blown mania.  While manic_ I stopped taking all my meds_ and the mania lifted.    Because I'd taken the Provigil so long with no apparent ill effects_ I (illogically) assumed it was the Tysabri which caused the mania.  I stopped the Tysabri_ added back in the Provigil_ and gradually noticed I was beginning to have ""magical thinking_"" a symtpon which presaged the hypomania turing into mania.  So_ I stopped the Provigil and the magical thinking went",F,50,5  years,3/24/2009,Provigil
198, 4, for SSRI apathy,Provigil does raise your body temperature a little bit so I felt hot sometimes. It also has a tolerance build up that is perceptible.

After about 7 months on the 100 mg daily dose_ I began to notice the accelerated hair loss (especially thinning at the temples and ""crown"")_ and then unexplained itchiness in my scalp area.  The dark strong colored urine was apparent immediately after starting the med.

I was diagnosed with narcolepsy in my early 20sI had always felt like I was more tired than other people but I realized there was something really wrong when (even though I was sleeping 9-10 hours a night) I feel asleep in the middle of an air shift at a local radio station that I was working at! But since starting the drug about 3 years ago I can only think of once or twice where I have fallen asleep inappropriately...miles better than the every few hours I was falling asleep before! Something else Ive found interesting is that the longer I have taken it_ coupled with trying to stay on a pretty consistent sleep schedule_ my sleep quality seems like it has gotten better. I used to have a lot of very vivid dreams and hypnotic hallucinations but they seem to happen much less,One thing Ive noticed (and I think I remember reading this in an article somewhere) is that Ibuprofen seems to interact with Provigil. For me it seems like it might speed up the metabolism of itIm not sure_ but I know that if I take an Ibuprofen just a few hours after taking a dose of Provigil I feel like Ive taken too much ProvigilI get that kinda weird_ kind of hyper/nervous feeling_ and then Ill crash a few hours later and be very tired. But Ive used this to my advantage too a few timesif I start getting tired in the late afternoon  (I just take 200mg in the AM) if I take an Ibuprofen its almost like Ive taken another dose of Provigil but it wears off in plenty of time for me to go to bed. This has not happened when Ive taken Tylenol.,F,25,3  years,1/18/2009,Provigil
218, 2, hypersomnolence,The first day was great. I felt like I had a new lease on life. Second day was okay but not as good as the first. On the third day I noticed a slight rash on my lower legs. On my inner thighs there was a large area that was red and chapped looking.  These symptoms would wax and wane. And they would intensify if I tookan extra 100mg to get me through the day. The symptoms never got unbearable. But very close. I only took it for one month since it was nowhere near as effective as I expected_ cost was $380 (not covered by insurance)_ and gave this side effect. Now one month later_ I still have the same symptoms.,If it works for you_ great. But it turned out to be more of a hassle than it was worth.,M,30,28  days,1/15/2009,Provigil

The first day I took this I felt great! I had energy and was productive and felt awake. I thought it was going to be a miracle drug. Ha! Everyday after the first was hell. I felt mildly awake but asleep at the same time. It made me like a zombie. My husband would laugh at me because it would take me way too long to make simple decisions. Stopped taking it a week later. Switched to Methylphenidate and had similar side effects. Now on Adderall and it's too early to tell if this will work yet. Hope so!,F,31,6  days,1/15/2009,Provigil

Provigil seemed a little brighter_ but I noticed the same trend: good concentration for the first 6 or 7 times I took it and then less and less positive effects.

The first time I took it I felt increased energy_ a little on edge_ but not bad.  Second day and each subsequent day (I only took it 7 days)_ my side effects got worse and worse.  I would lay on the couch for hours shaking and sweating.  I was crying ALL the time.  I got extremely depressed to the point I was planning my suicide.  I was constantly nervous.  Luckily I live with my parents (due to my health problems) and my Mom noticed the changes happening to me and got me off of it.  By the time I stopped I was almost psychotic.  As a side note_ I have no history of mental or mood problems_ so this was way out of the norm for me.  It took two weeks to feel back to normal.

When the tingling/numbness began suddenly in my feet_ I became worried that the diabetes was progressing_ rather suddenly. I am not very regimented in my diet_ but I do exercise vigorously(walking hills and lifting weights) at least 4x/week. Anyways_ I stopped the Provigil(300mg_ 1xday) for 3 days_ and the tingling/numbness in my feet stopped. However_ my daytime sleepiness_ and my irritability and anti-social demeanor(present prior to Provigil) returned very quickly. I took 100mg Provigil this a.m._ and my feet are tingling.

At first_ I could not believe him. As time went on I became sleepier and sleepier in the daytime despite the medicine and I became aware that I had developed difficulty swallowing_ a constant sore throat_ postnasal dryness and swelling; not only was I snoring in my sleep but also making small snoring sounds while awake_ just by drawing breath across the swollen postnasal and throat tissues. My poor sleeping abilities became worse due to this. The my doctor sent me for a sleep study where they determined I should have CPAP therapy. I decided to postpone the CPAP and first try detoxing myself from the Provigil. Why do doctors just treat symptoms and not listen to the root complaint!!!?,I think that this is a great med for some people (not me). BUT...after reading about it I also hope anyone considering its use would enter into it knowing that it might not work and also that it might actually make things worse.

I could barely make it the 25 min drive to work in the a.m. after a full nights sleep with out driving off the road. When at work it got so bad that my boss caught me several times nodding off or flat out sleeping at my desk. My head would get very foggy when my sleepiness would come on_ and being young and not understanding what was happening this got very frustrating and depressing to me. I would fall asleep very early at night_ and still doze during the day where ever I was and when ever. Would even take my lunch break and sleep in my car for an hour in hopes it would make me feel better.I just never felt that I got enough sleep ever. I went to a sleep clinic over night and for a day study. I also went again at the request of the doctor for another day study just to ensure that he diagnosed me correctly as I was quite young. The sleep study showed that on average it took me 2 mins to fall asleep.At the study I,I was wrong_ I fell asleep each and every time_ without even knowing it. My docotor diagnosed me with idiopathic hypersomnia (sleepy brain_ form of narcolepsy) and first prescribed dexadrine/dexastrat (sp?) which was what my father takes. It was one fast acting capsule that worked immediately and one pill to last for the day. This was WAY to strong for me_ felt like I was on speed or something_ made my heart race_ it was horrible. My doctor then prescribed Provigil_ 200 mg a day to be taken in the morning. For me this medicine is an absolute life saving miracle. I have been taking Provigil for over 5 years and every year that I go in for my check up with the doctor I tell him that it has been a life saver for me. I take it regularly_ and very seldom miss a dose. If I do miss a dose and it's later in the afternoon_ I find it's best not to take it until the next day_ otherwise I do sometimes have trouble falling alseep at night.

I was prescribed this medication because of excessive sleepiness during my 10 pm to 6 am work shift and sleeplessness upon going to bed.  Not only has is helped me regulate my sleep/wake cycle it has also helped cure my major depression.  I suffered for most of my life from crippling depression.  I have been mostly unresponsive to traditional drug treatments and conjunctive psychological therapies.  I cant say exactly how this drug did it but it did.  I FEEL NORMAL (whatever that is) for the first time in my adult life. By feeling normal I have been able to change destructive thought patterns through counseling and SSRI drug treatment.,M,30,2  years,7/28/2008,Provigil
260, 1, unexplained sleepiness,Near-death.,"I have already commented about how this drug nearly killed me. I have studied it more since. If you are like I was_ when you read that a drug has killed or badly injured someone_ you will say_ ""Well_ for every drug there are a few people who cannot tolerate it. That's life."" But Provigil is not one of THOSE drugs. Consider this: In its own testing_ Cephalon_ the company which makes Provigil_ found that 2%_ 1 out of every 50 people people who took Provigil developed low blood pressure_ also called hypotension. Then look through this list of over 300 people. Count how many of these 350+ people reporting here say they developed hypotension after starting on Provigil. I count exactly one person. Yet if Cephalon's own statistics are true_ then there should be closer to 7 people (1 out of 50) reporting low blood pressure. So why aren't there another 5 or 6 people on this list reporting low blood pressure? Well_ the one person who DID report hypotension was me. And it was hypotensio",M,,5  weeks,7/28/2008Email,Provigil
261, 5, fibromyalgia,slight trembling in fingers_ butterflies in stomach,"This drug saved my life!  Has not only improved ""brain fog""_ but has alleviated my pain_ which I've not heard other FM patients describe.  I don't take any other meds for my FM_ and can feel pain returning if am late with dosage. Take 200mg per day.  Feel less pain_ less fatigue and the brain fog has lifted!  Is like being reunited with my old self!  I encourage anyone to ask their Dr. about provigil.  Am sure is not right for everyone_ but for me_ has been the BEST!  Do not have insurance_ my nice doctor gave me free samples...but will find a way to pay whatever I have to.  The benefits are just too great!  --- insurance pays for viagra_ but not provigil?? We all need to start complaining and get our voices heard!",F,42,10  days,7/26/2008,Provigil
262, 5, Sleep Apnea,occasional headaches_ strong-smelling urine_ slight anxiety_ disrupts sleep schedule if taken too late_ suppressed appetite (lost 20 pounds in the first 2 months of being on Provigil--but I needed to lose the weight)_ loose/soft stool,"This truly is an amazing drug. I'm taking 400mg every day; 200mg in the morning and 200mg in the afternoon. I'm currently using CPAP for ""obstructive"" sleep apnea_ though my ENT doctor was unable to identify any obstruction_ but I'm in the process of investigating thyroid issues potentially caused by a pituitary tumor--which may actually be causing my sleep apnea. In any event_ CPAP isn't working too well for me_ and I suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness_ compounded by my recent thyroid problems_ which make me feel more tired_ as if this were even possible. Provigil's side effects were very noticeable for me at first_ then became much milder after the first week or two. I'm able to stay awake and alert more easily during the day whereas I used to fall asleep in every single class during college (recent grad) and perform extremely poorly in classes early/late in the day. I wish I had started Provigil much earlier_ because I've been exhausted my entire life_ to the point w",F,22,11  months,7/23/2008Email,Provigil

Headaches annoying and not as bad after time but itchy skin worse after time.  Not sure if the jaw clenching/tooth grinding is due to Provigil - have had this from stress in the past but it is much worse this time. Would be ok without the side effects.,F,36,50  days,7/14/2008,Provigil
265, 5, multiple schlerosis,weight loss,I started taking 100 mg of Provigil a year and a half ago.  I am now up to 200 mg one time a day and I take it around 11am.My concern is my weight.  I was 183 pounds_ I am now 132 pounds.  I have also mad dietary changes that includes a lot less carbs.  Potatoes and breads to name a few.  Not that they are 100% out of my diet_ maybe 75% from my diet.People are starting to look at me as if I am not doing the right thing.

268, 5, obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea,Slight headache first day towards end of day on the first day_ None on second day. Will post more info at the end of the week,I have always been sleepy during the day since I was in High School_ but I never would have guessed that my excessive sleepiness was caused from OSA. I was a pretty smart kid but I could never stay awake in class and would often wear a hat so the teacher couldn't tell i was sleeping. I ended up dropping out of college because I fell asleep in every class causing me to miss material and fail exams. Soon after began working full time in an office only to get fired for falling asleep at my desk. After attending a polysomnography test at a sleep center I was prescribed a CPAP machine for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) which helped but still have fell asleep during most days.  My doctor prescribed me the 7 day trial so I'm testing it out.  So far so good.  Been really alert and have not dosed off once.  Also_ got a lot done today,M,26,2  days,6/16/2008,Provigil
269, 2, fatigue_ brain fog_ sleepiness,headache first two days_ loose bowels_a growing feeling of anxiety as medication wore off,I'm a chronic insomniac and obviously that is the biggest reason for my tiredness_ but I always feel spacey and can't concentrate so my psychiatrist suggested Provigil. I am also on Lexapro 20mg for depression. Upon taking the first 200mg pill on day one_ I felt okay - slightly energized_ then by 5pm I had a massive headache that went on into the night. The next day - feeling ill from no sleep and headache I cut it in half to 100mg and felt okay. On  day 3 my lower back started aching_ but no headache_ day 4 today I had loose bowels and could feel the medication wearing off around 4pm - just a crashing feeling of tiredness_ and feel a lump of anxiety in my stomach that I've not felt before. I may stick with the 100mg to see if things improve_ but so far the side effects are not worth the few hours of energy/concentration.,F,30,4  days,6/16/2008,Provigil
270, 3, sleep apnea treatment ineffective,colored urine,Odd how a drug can make you both alert and asleep at the same time. Perhaps it merely wakes me up enough to observe how far south I have gone.Better than nothing for uncorrectable sleep apnea,M,55,4  months,6/14/2008,Provigil
271, 4, ADD,The first couple of weeks I had trouble sleeping.  I seem to be more prone to sinus problems.  More sensitive to caffeine.,I had problems at work and read up on ADD and read how so many others have the same problems.  Saw a Psychiatrist and asked him about it.  He ordered a QEEG and came to the conclusion I had low histamine levels and put me on Provigil.  I take 200mg in the morning and 100-200 in the afternoon on workdays depending on how busy I am.  I have forgotten it before on numerous occasions_ each time I was reminded how well it works.  Overall I can't see where I have had any major side effects_ I have always been a little sensitive to caffeine and this has increased that a bit but overall so long as I keep that in check and there are no other outside factors keeping me from sleeping no problems.  I have also moved on to a new job where I am doing great_ I still have to work to stay organized and I make errors but overall my experience has been great.  I was diagnosed with ADD at 28.,M,30,2  years,6/13/2008,Provigil

The next day_ before taking the Provigil_ I had a horrible panic attack. My heart was racing and I had trouble breathing. I felt like I might die. However_ I knew I was having a panic attack and so was able to ride it through. I have discontinued use of Provigil.,I would recommend serious consideration before taking Provigil if you have any form of anxiety disorder. I would also recommend discussing the medication with a psychiatrist (not just your regular doctor) before starting treatment.,F,29,5  days,6/13/2008,Provigil

It has completely changed my life and did so in the first hour.  I wake up early_ go to bed easily and best of all....stay asleep as I used to wake up 4-6 times a night.QUESTION?

277, 4, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,rapid thoughts_ stong urine odor_ difficult to go to sleep at night,This drug is effective. I can think clearly_ and it gives me the energy to accomplish tasks.  I can focus on what needs to be done and not just lie around all day watching TV_  wishing I had the energy to get up and go. I never take it after 12 noon_ or it will not wear off in time for me to sleep. I do not take it every day_ perhaps three times a week. But I need it everyday_ just don't want to become resistant to its effectiveness.,F,48,2  years,6/9/2008,Provigil
278, 5, Fatigue/Eppstein-Barr Virus,Increased energy_ excellent concentration_ appetite suppressed_ clear mind_ organized thoughts_ more alert_ overall feeling much better and more normal.,After 15 years of doctors switching me from every antidepressant on the market_ I demanded that they check into Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and allow me to at least try Provigil to see if it helped me.  My doctor did some blood work and I left the office with a prescription for Provigil 200 mg. daily.  I took my first dose_ and in less than two hours_ I was a new person.  This IS my miracle drug and I feel normal again.  Eppstein-Barr affects people differently and usually shows no signs.  95% of adults over 30 in the United States have this virus (contracted from being exposed or around someone with Mononucleosis during childhood or adulthood).  Still taking 200 mg every morning.  I forgot to take it one day and could not stay awake and could not stop eating_ just like prior to starting Provigil.,F,35,6  months,5/30/2008Email,Provigil

I am only taking 100 mg per day because I cannot handle the full 200mg. The first time I took it_ I did not have the headaches_ smelly urine_ post nasal drip_ fuzzy vision_ or muscle aches. A word of advice is to make sure you eat while taking provigil. You will probably lose your appetite. When I was taking it regularly_ I barely ate and went through rapid weight loss. Not eating enough calories screwed up my metabolism_ so when I stopped taking the provigil_ I rapidly gained all my weight back + 2 lbs and have not been able to lose the weight through exercise.

Each person reacts differently to meds. I've read every pamphlet/website/research study re: Provigil that I could find. There's risks with any meds and I'm willing to take them w/Provigil to get my life back. I log all side effects so that I have a record of how my body is reacting to the med and can discuss w/my Dr. if necessary. I'm very grateful for Provigil.

I have been battling MS Fatigue to the point of almost thinking of quitting my job_ but desparatly need the money. I can complete all tasks just like before diagnosis of MS. It is a little pricey even with insurance. Trouble convinving insurance co. to pay for it and MD had to call them herself.

The next morning when I woke_ took my medication with no reaction.  Up the dosage and had the same result.  Great energy the first day_ then no increase in energy.  The positive side though was how I had more clarity in my thinking.  Even though I didn't have energy back I was willing to stay on the drug to keep the fog out of my brain.

Helps to stay focused and on task and I am much more alert. I am prescribed 500 mg but usually take around 300 and I find modulating dosage increases effectiveness_ taking a day or two off or taking less. Only worry is long term dependence.

Swollen itchy eyes.  Loss of appetite.  Mild flushed face (butterfly flush from cheeks over nose).,To begin with_ I have been struggling with severe fatigue lately.  The first few days of Provigil_ I started with 200mg and had mild discomfort in the chest with a little shortness of breath.  I had also experienced the mild hyperness with moderate depression.  I decreased the dosage to 100mg and continued to experience the mild hyperness with no deep sleep at all.  The depression lifted but was replaced with itchy_ watery eyes.  Today woke up with a swollen_ itchy eye and a mild flush of a butterly shape over my cheeks and nose.

Some euphoria early on_ but that has mostly abated_ some declining effect over time..  When I drop back to 100mg_ it sort of ""resets"" the effectiveness.

I could sleep soundly anywhere from 5 to 9 hrs and nothing was ever enough. I started taking it a few months back and it has been a life saver... in more ways then just my own. I am alert (not wired like on meds but like im rested and awake) and able to make it through my shifts with no problem. I found that taking a whole 200mg tablet was just too much for me. It would keep me awake WAY more then I wanted to be. So a half a pill at the start of my shifts is just enough to get me through fine.

I take 100mg upon waking and have improved energy_ focus_ mood_ and mental clarity.  Despite suspicions I have found no side effects.  I skip taking Provigil periodically to check for dependence and see none.  The greatest benefit is that it aids in keeping me in a frame of mind where I can put forth the maximum effort in therapy while at the same time deal with everyday issues.

After a month_ I returned to 200mg and have had no side effects for 2 years.,"I have always been against taking medication_ especially when it affects my brain. However_ my college roommates called me ""the sleeper"" and I lost an opportunity at a prestigious consulting firm because as an intern I fell asleep in meetings. I then began my career in a traveling sales role so that I would not be behind a desk. I do not drink alcohal_ yet my coworkers often asked if I was hung-over. At my next job_ I was told to get more sleep or I would be fired. Getting enough sleep was not my problem. Doctor ran several tests and sent me toa sleep lab_ but found nothing wrong. Thinking I might have a mild case of narcolepsy_ they suggested I try Provigil for a week. From that day forward_ I've had my life back. At first_ 200mg a day was too much_ so I dropped to 100mg a day. After a month_ I began taking 200mg again. For the last two years I have been able to work a full day without getting drowsy.

For people like me with chronic narcolepsy (or other sleep condition) that cannot be controlled any other way_ I think the one plus side of this mediction is that it makes me feel human again & I can function normally from when I get up until I go to bed in the evening! I would be as well leaving myself at home if I decided not to take this medication to work as I would spend the full day falling in & out of narcoleptic 'episodes' - embarassing & very unproductive!!!,F,27,4  years,2/5/2008Email,Provigil

Anyway the first week on provigil I was taking 200/mg when I woke up every morning. I had a little diarhea the first day which the dr said would be normal but that's all I had .. The medication wasn't doing anything to keep me awake. After a couple more days I started getting the upset stomach and complete loss of appetite. I can't eat ANYTHING no matter what it is or how bad I want it.. After 1 week I went back to the drs and told him it wasn't doing anything for me I was still exhausted and sleeping all day. He upped me to 400/mg a day which I started today_ only change is my headaches are a lot worse. I'm still exhausted still napping all day.. I keep reading that some of the females my age are only taking 100/mg a day and its a miracle cure_ I'm a normal size person my age 5'2 135 lbs.. Why is it theirs,If anyone my age reads this feel free to im me_ I would like to hear how its been working or not working for u. .

Was also suffering from loss of coordination_ balance and muscle weakness to the point of walking with a cane. Suffered from visual disturbances from the syndrome. After 2 weeks_ was able to give up the cane and after a month_ was able to work without fatigue_ restored full mobility and coordination. Most of visual problems have subsided - something of a miracle. Have learned that after 5 days of not taking the drug_ all of the previous symptoms return. 200mg per day seems to be a good dose for me_ although the initial euphoria and well-being feelings have passed and replaced with feeling absolutely normal.

My body seems to adjust to med after a few days/weeks and the positive effects are much less noticeable.  Worried about tolerance.  Benefits far outweigh the side-effects so far...,I am new to this med - started at 100 mg daily; when effect wore off after a couple days_ doc increased it to 200 mg q am.

Benefit of no appetite in day time but hunger in eve.  Beginning to see strange behavior and less energy than initially - worried about tolerance.. and late appearing side-effects.

I believe feeling so tired was because of depression_ or perhaps a side effect of it.  While the Wellbutrin XL along with therapy helped with the depression_ I was still somewhat tired a great deal of the time.  When I discussed this with my therapist_ she suggested Provigil to me and I did some research on it_ particularly in combination with an antidepressant.  I expressed a concern to her about taking a cocktail of drugs and told her that if I decided to start with Provigil I would start to eliminate the Wellbutrin and she agreed so long as I did not suffer or become depressed again.  At first I found the Provigil taken alone at full strength too much for me.  I was hyper and even dizzy.

I can concentrate_ think more clearly_ drive safely_ and cut back on my caffeine use! I am a pre-med student and thanks to Provigil I can get back on track. 200mg per day works just fine.

I eat less_ which is good for me.,I have had fatigue for three years.  This drug has saved my life.  I have energy again_ but not a nervous energy.  I want to work_ be with my family_ begin and complete projects. This is really a revolutionary experience for me.  I tried other meds and didn't like the Side Effects.   I take 100 mg in the morning around 9 am.  This lasts most of the day.  I sleep well at night_ sleep more soundly than I have in years and wake up ready to go.  I also take an nsaid (non-steroid anti-inflammatory) for my muscle pain_ but no other drugs.,F,54,1  months,4/23/2007Email,Provigil
394, 2, Excessive daytime sleepiness,Severe depression once eugoric side effects of Provigil (Modalert) wear off. I generally suffer from mild depression_ but Provigil compounds this depression considerably and predictably turns this into a 'severe' form the evening or day after I take the medication. The manufacturer lists depression as a common side effect_ so those who have a tendency toward depression should be aware of this before developing a psychological depedency on Provigil_ which is quite easy to do. Aside from this_ I did not have any physical side effects aside from_ sometimes_ a slight headache and decreased appetite. Perhaps muscle tension in my shoulders and back. Again_ let me stress that the severe depression is clearly related to the Provigil withdrawal_ and so I have stopped taking it altogether despite the temporary 'high' that I get for the few hours after I take it.,Do not take alone as an anti-depressant_ despite what you may have heard about its eugoric effects. For those who are mild to moderately depressed_ Provigil withdraw may lead to suicidal ideation and severe depressive episodes that encourage a dependency with increased usage and dosage increases (tolerance develops rapidly)_ and so a dangerous cycle of psychological dependency can occur. It is great while it lasts_ but so are many drugs. Use with caution.,M,31,6  months,4/21/2007,Provigil
395, 5, Excessive sleepiness,None,I take 100 mg in the morning around 8-9 am and it keeps me awake all day long until I'm ready for sleep around midnight or so. I had been falling asleep whenever I would sit down for longer than 20 minutes and being a chemistry student_ this is not good on the GPA. I'm able to stay awake in class now and study for an extended period of time without wanting to sleep. I had gone on a week long vacation and had no withdrawal symptoms. I have not developed tolerance either. I like it because it keeps me awake without making me jittery like other stimulants and it's only a schedule 4 controlled substance.,M,22,40  days,4/9/2007,Provigil

Incidentally_ I use Alertec from Canada_ manufactured under license_ as it is considerably cheaper and is the same.","I had to use it regularly for some time until I had the desired effect.

401, 5, excess. daytime sleepiness,"I took this once before but I think I stopped because of its cost. I started it again today _to replace adderall_ which I have just discovered has been basically *giving* me ADD and OCD. As well as intense anxiety. Almost manic surges. Anyway--I will be able to describe provigil's effect in a few days. I'm writing now because many people have written here about jaw clenching_ teeth grinding_ and tongue biting as side effects. I have always had trouble with this_ but after a horrific trauma_ together with the adderall_ I found myself biting my tongue at night to the point where I'd bitten at least halfway through on one side. I should go to a dentist and get a teeth guard to wear at night_ I know. But meanwhile_ I have completely stopped the tongue biting by working on the trigger points in and around my jaw. I accidentally came across ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"" in a friend's house_ and started perusing it.

Previously_ I was on Adderal which worked well in keeping me awake and alert_ but led to an increase in my blood pressure. Also I felt like I was always a little jumpy. The Provigil is great. I get the same benefit as with the adderal but it feels natural. No increase in blood pressure or jittery feelings.,F,41,2  months,3/20/2007,Provigil
404, 2, Severe Fatigue from Lupus and Depr.,Within 1 hr of taking_ felt more fatigued than I felt before. Almost fell asleep behind the wheel on my way to work. Trouble focusing and even speaking. Weird feeling. Felt very slow moving. Mild_ constant headache. If I talked too fast or too much_ I got winded and I felt funny. Sometimes I felt weird in my chest- can't really describe it. Slight diarrhea. Very clumsy. Sinus problems.,Ok_ all these symptoms are from day 1. I hope it gets better. Within 1 hour of taking this drug_ I immediately wanted to go to sleep_ and I was driving! The fatigue lasted all day and it was twice as bad as it normally was. I felt like I was on a downer all day. I am usually a fast mover and I moved like a snail all day long. I didn't even care though. If I tried to talk to someone_ I would get winded and funny feeling (especially if I was talking fast). I am normally not clumsy and dropped everything all day long. Within 2 hrs of taking drug_ I developed sinus issues. Hope this gets better_ if not then this is def. not for me.  Oh yeah_ I also found myslef talking all day....to myself! Weird for me. I also couldn't focus when trying to do work and would forget what I was saying constantly.,F,29,1  days,3/20/2007Email,Provigil

409, 5, Narcolepsy; excessive sleepiness,It made me hyper for the first two days but in a good way.  It was more energy than I had experienced in years.I don't remember much else from the early symptoms.  It is most effective for me when taken at the same time daily -- when I get up.  If I take it too late it produces insomnia.  Once I accidentally stopped taking it for a week or so and the effects were immediate -- extreme lethargy_ sleepiness_ vivid dreams.  I thought I was coming down with something but it went away as soon as I restarted the medication.I have heard that it is not as effective for some people if they stop taking it and restart it again but this has not been the case for myself.,I can honestly say that this drug has improved my life.  I tell you in the utmost sobriety that without this drug I would not be able to function as a normal human being.  I would not be able to perform my duties at work.  I would not have been able to advance at my work.  I owe where I am today and what I have accomplished in my professional life in part to taking this drug.,F,23,1  years,2/27/2007,Provigil
410, 5, Excessive Daytime Sleepiness,Mild nervous foot taping_ etc.  Better sleep.,This drug saved my life.  I was sleeping 16-18 hours a day and the doctors could not figure out why.  I saw an article on the internet about Provigil and I asked my doctor if I could try it.  My employer was planning on putting me on disability the next week.  That was over two years ago and I'm still working.  I notice that I have a habit of moving my thumb in a cirlce on the TV remote.  It drives my wife crazy_ but not as much as the constant sleeping did.  The only other negative is some mild teeth clenching.  I definitely sleep better now that I am taking Provigil.  I was diagnosed with sleep apnea_ but the pumps didn't help.  This did.  I take one 200 mg tablet every morning.  Before this drug I could not drive more than 15 minutes without being in danger of falling asleep at the wheel.  That's all gone.  Completely!  I have my life back!!!,M,60,2  years,2/21/2007,Provigil

After drinking one cup of coffee I feel like I just drank 8 cups of coffee.,Provigil works better if you take it at the same time each day and definitely take it in the morning! This might sound like common sense_ but being a college student I have a different kind of schedule. Somedays I have early classes_ somedays I don't. And the weekend is a whole other story.

415, 3, Daytime sleepiness due to circadian,I thought I had caught the flu the other day_ until reading some of these reviews.  I have diarhea_ no appitite_ chills_ fever_ headache_ etc._ however those seem to be an initial side effect.  That_ or I'm just sick.  I worked out yesterday and got winded far too easily_ and become winded walking up the stairs--but I've read some people reporting bronchial tightening_ so again maybe it is the Provigil.  I had a lousy headache the other night_ and I usually don't get headaches very often.  My mouth has been VERY dry_ to the point where my lips are all dry and cracked_ despite the fact that I drink prodigious amounts of water all day long.  This isn't technically a side effect_ but I've noticed the medicine is not as effective as it was when I began (2 weeks ago)_ and it seems to lose its effectiveness by about 3pm_ at which point I crash_ unrecoverably.  I'll talk about this more in the next section.,It worked well the first four days.  I was taking 100 mg.  I felt energetic_ confident_ productive_ at a time of day I am never those things--morning.  However_ the strength of effect has subsided somewhat_ so I think I will increase to a more common dosage (200mg) and will report back then.  One thing I clearly noticed is the crash.  I am not a morning person . . . hell_ I'm not even a day person.  I usually don't catch my first wind until 7pm.  On the provigil however_ I am a much more functional person during the first half of the day_ until the crash in the mid-afternoon.  At that point_ you'd think I hadn't slept in days.  That is weird for me_ being a night person_ and now being totally drained by 5pm.  I teach an anatomy course_ in the late evening_ so this is also problematic for that reason as well.  It seems provigil has given me the first half of the day_ but taken away the second (and most productive) half.  I'm not so sure that trade off is worth it.

Followed by progressive worsening of following side effects: chills_ fever_ dry mouth_ headache_ total loss of appetite_ significant nausea_ full body tremors (particularly bad in hands)_ tinglely feeling throughout body_ worsened IBS_ tachycardia (155bpm consistently throughout day)_ heart palpitations (pounding/fluttering heart) all day_ some shortness of breath and a general unwell feeling. Worsened insomnia.,I did not tolerate this medication well and had significant side effects_ starting almost immediately_ that lasted at least 20 hours after taking the medication. I was non-functional for the two days I was on it and several days after.Be extremely careful with this medication if you have any sort of heart problem_ particular valve problems (even if not MVP)_ if you have or are suspected to have any type of ANS disorder like POTS_ or if you've shown a sensitivity to other stimulants_ even ones technically in a different class than Provigil.,F,16,2  days,11/18/2006,Provigil

Everything ok now.,I am taking this for ADD and I noticed that the wired feeling I had all the time is gone after 20-30 min of taking it. Otherwise I feel calmer.

A little OCD when I get in to things now they have to be perfect and my way or I cant let it go. I was never like that befor.  Motor functions seem to be more jumpy since I started but that might be the ms more and just a quienq.,All in all big diffrence but im thinking of trying somthing else.

446, 5, fatigue from LUPUS,Mild anxiety when active_ or after 12 hr shift/200mg Headache_ palpatations.,Has given me my life back. Now able to do what I love as ER RN_ be active with my son and husband when needed. Can go days without taking it - when I do take it I feel positive_ not quite euphoric_ but just happy and alive. Have had depression for years and this is the best drug I have ever taken without risk of addiction or side effects. I love it.,F,50,12  months,11/14/2006,Provigil
447, 5, lifelong daytime drowsiness,For the first few months on Provigil I experienced flu-like symptoms - aches and chills - doctor said it was common_ and gradually they went away. If I take too much_ I can get a little shaky_ but not anxious. Like others_ my urine seems darker and stronger-smelling. The most annoying side effect is that I clench my jaws to the point of headaches sometimes_ AND - this is the worst - I compulsively push my tongue against the back of my lower teeth so that after awhile my tongue and gums are sore; I've even gotten irritation sores on my tongue. Even though I'm aware of it_ I can't stop it. My dentist doesn't think I'm hurting my teeth_ anyway. And it's bearable.,"Before Provigil_ driving any long distance was agony because I had to fight drowsiness so often. (A sleep test said I have ""fragmented sleep"" but found no cause.)Now I'm totally alert_ and the drug is amazing in that I can stay alert and interested through boring lectures and meetings; I contribute and perform much better. (I wish I had had it in college!) I read somewhere that it can make antidepressants more effective (I take Paxil and trazodone) and I really believe it: sometimes if I'm feeling down_ I take Provigil for that purpose_ it really helps.  Interestingly_ the drug seems to create a tolerance very quickly - if I take it for several days in a row_ I have to increase the dose quite a bit; if I'm trying to work late in the evening_ it seems that even taking more Provigil after dinner doesn't really keep me up much later. So I try not to use it every day_ and that brings back its potency quickly. I take anywhere from zero to 100 mg to 200 mg and very occasionally mor",M,61,4  times,11/14/2006Email,Provigil

Then after the 7 days I went downhill ...no effect at all...went from 200mg daily to 250mg_started with head aches back pains_hand and feet pains. I was very disappointed....I thought I had found my wonder drug. Too affraid to go up to 300mg because of the side-effects.,Too expensive....but if it had worked out for me I would have made sure I stayed with it.

I assumed it would go away_ so I continued to take it. Day 4 I was extremely irritated for no reason. Day 5 I didn't feel the drug at all and I was starting to feel depressed (i don't know if the provigil was the source of this_ i am also bipolar). Day 6 took twice as much (200mg) still nothing.

The doctors recommended increasing the dosage from 100-200mg/day to 400-600/day.  Instead I quit altogether to get a feel for my condition without the medication - to reassess.

My memory seems less acute.,I find this far more effective_ for me_ than the standard psychotropics.  Most of them were disastrous.I take a hefty dose in the morning_ and it's really noticeable by late afternoon if I forget to take it.  It makes a big difference to my focus and hence my mood.

My urine smells funny too.,I am an artist....a writer & composer. I consider myself an emotionally stable person_ no depression_ but I don't feel as in-touch with my feelings when taking provigil. It blocks all my emotions (somewhat) good and bad. ...Joy and laughter_ spontaneity_ sadness. My creative instincts feel slightly blocked. I take as little as possible. 1 200-mg pill about 30 minutes after I wake up. This stops my sleepy spells until  late afternoon_ then I manage the rest of my day with short naps. I don't take provigil on the weekends. I've experimented with not taking provigil for weeks at a time.

I have regained control over my life and the respect of my family and co-workers.  I haven't craved or used Meth or any other illegal substance and don't plan to.

The ones i can narrow down to this medication are;strong medicine smell in urine_ major crash towards the end of the medication cycle.  a very small weight gain_ but i havent confirmed if it is a direct cause of the provigil or not.,I was on adderall which was great_ but would give me a stumach ache for a short time after each dose_ and bad night sweats.  We think it even messed with my blood levels. Without it though_ i was at 0 function.  After more then a year i was changed to provigil to see if it would be any better.  It helpes me start my day..which was a god send.  I do feel now_ that i need to take a higher dose to get enough of an effect. Im going to be talkig to my doctor about that.

Not just poor quality sleep but no sleep. Not even a minute. I also couldn't concentrate_ my concentration was far worse than when I was simply exhausted. I was in a kind of manic daze.Also as it stopped me from sleeping_ (until I would 'crash' perhaps at 10 a.m.) it created a dependency where I would have to take more to attend an exam/ revise that morning. I can't quite explain how 'out of it' I was on this medication_ I had little recollection of conversations I'd had whilst on it_ and diminished control over my behaviour. TERRIBLE as a study aid_ as however 'productive' I was whilst on it (would manicly devour revision material) I could not recollect anything I'd 'learnt' whilst on it. The whole experience was like taking time out from my life_ and entering some other strange and sinister realm. HIDEOUS HIDEOUS HIDEOUS.,For me it was truly TERRIBLE. If your body or brain chemistry is at all reactive/ sensitive I would avoid this like the plague. It is thought to work on the hypothalamus of the brain which is the whole body's control centre. My own doctor (not one that prescribed prov) could see hormonal electrolyte and blood abnormalities months after. Also increased autonomic nervous system functions_ perhaps 6 bowel movements a day_m drinking vast quantities of water_ 8litres/day and increased colorific requirements - weak if ate under 3000 calories/ day.Also developed excess hair for first time within week of taking this_ has not gone. I HATE provagil.  As a teenager I experimented with recreational drugs (youthful folly and all that) From experience_ this is FAR more unpleasant than any experience with cocaine_ ectasy or skunk_ and about on a par with the worst possible speed or mushroom trips.

I didn't believe what the people had written about provigil_ I thought the were working for the company_ and just promoting the pill.  I had never had any drug_ that worked exactly like I was told it would_ and not only that_ but I was used to waiting two or more weeks for the pill to work_ but this was advertised to me as working in about 20 minutes.  I didn't buy it.This is a miricle pill_ it does what it says it will do_ and it does it faster than anything I've ever taken.  I could not praise it enough_ to do it justice_ and could not convey how much gratitude I have for the doctor that suggested it to my doctor.

I take 200 mg 2X day in the am and early afternoon.  Love the initial come on to the drug_ but do come down after a 2-3 delightful period.  At that point I want another one.  There is a ""crashed"" feeling as the drug wears off.  However_ this drug does bring some of the excitement and edge back to life that I think all SSRI's take away_ along with the process of eliminating whatever you took them for in the first place (in my case panic disorder and mild depression).  I just started to notice an apathetic state on prozac and wanted to feel some kind of edge back that the Prozac took away. Provigil also seems to have a mood brightening effect.",Provigil is quite expensive  I have found a Canadian resource (jandrugs) that gets a generic made in Fiji that is more cost effective. I do notice that the more I take it_ the less the effect to a slight degree  Still works well_ but some tolerance adjustment is involved.

It has a tiny mood elevating effect..or is it just that my brain is finally able to function?,At first_ I hated being dependent upon a drug to function_ especially with my history of addiction.  Then after being on it for almost 3 years_ 200mg to 400mg daily as needed_ I changed insurance and got cut off.  No withdrawals.  Just a return to my previous sleepiness and difficulty functioning.  Complex thought/cognitive process (like required at work) are difficult while light conversation with a friend poses less of a problem. After 4 months of hell off it_ I am on my second day allowed only 100mg by the new doc.  My cognitive processes are pretty darn good for 6 hours.  I start to fade after that.     PROVIGIL HAS GIVEN ME BACK MY BRAIN AND MY LIFE.  I only wish the new insurance had already approved it so I didn't have to depend upon samples.  It is horrendously expensive. I had been spending $200 a month as my co-pay which was 1/5 my monthly wages. If I didn't_ I might as well not work.

Unable to make it through the day without sleeping.  I had to quit work_ because I would be falling asleep at my desk.  I tried everything. Nothing worked.  Then I tried Provigil_ and it works like a charm.  I take 300mg per day and I don't know what I would do without it. I work again_ 3 days a week_ I actually put make up on again_ something I hadnt done in 4 years.  I spend time on my hair_ I have energy to excersize when im not too sore from my other medical conditions.  It makes me feel semi normal again_ and for that im so so greatful.  My insurance wont cover it because it's only covered for narcolepsy_ so I get it from Canada_ which works out a lot cheaper for me.

I am asleep within minutes of laying down.,I take 300-400 mgs a day.  It saved me having to quit my job.  I can still take naps and go to sleep at night very easily.  However_ there are days when I still have sleep attacks.  Although this has happened a couple of times in the afternoon_ most of the time they are in the morning prior to 10:00 a.m.  I take it at 7:00 a.m.  It's like it takes that long to reach it's full effectiveness and alot of times I feel awake but still tired.  If I don't take it for a day_ I fall asleep all day long.  I am discontinuing a couple of meds that contribute to my excessive sleepiness and I am anxious to see what happens after that.

I haven't noticed any unpleasant side effects_ except the strong urine odor_ but I can deal with that.

I also was in the beginning of menapause and was still on the birth control pill which I still took religiously_ and but got pregnant on Provigil_ so I think women REALLY need to be warned about the fact that it does decrease the effects of some birth control.  I miscarried the pregnancy.,"I have been on Provigil for at least 3 years I rarely require naps anymore and can stay awake a big miracle_ I do not need as much Provigil as I used to.  Sometimes now I feel like I have too many thoughts_ or I can get more obsessive on Provigil.  I have a feeling that it is connected to the Provigil but not entirely sure.I think Provigil is a great drug for people with fibromyalgia_ sjogren's_ and excessive day time sleepiness.  I'm glad to see that doctors are treating some of these syndrome like I have with Provigil.  For the most part it really has helped me.  If it wasn't for the sexual side effects I would rate this drug higher.  I have developed some IBS (the catch all phrase for the docs) a lot of stomach pain and wonder if anybody else has had problems in this way.  I was hospitalized twice with extreme stomache pains.

Somewhat surprised at how tired I looked_ when I felt so awake.  Noticed some back pain_ slight headache and blurred vision_ but thought it was due to the hours I spent at my desk working.  I wasnt getting up as much as I normally do (moving around to stay awake).  Coworkers asked if I was feeling ok as I was not as talkative as I normally am_ again I attributed that to how focused I was on working.

528, 5, Narcolepsy,Loss of appetite for first 6 months (lost about 25 pounds).  Absolutely brutal hangovers.,Changed my life completely when I started taking it.  I went from being a C student in high school to graduating college with a 3.5 gpa_ mostly because of this medicine.  I feel like a normal person for most of the day.  I still get sleepy sometimes but its nothing like before.  Effect has not diminished over time.,M,22,4  years,8/2/2005,Provigil
529, 1, ADD,Difficulty starting urination_ maintaining the stream and fully voiding. Got worse the longer I took the Provigil. Stopped for 6 months_ tried again with same results. Problem is_ the side effect persisted even after finally stopping Provigil for good.,Did not warn me of possible side effect_ though drug company knew of it. Very upset about that.,M,62,5  months,8/2/2005Email,Provigil
530, 2, Night Shift Related Fatigue,No side effects,I have taken Provigil as directed and I feel just as sleepy as I was before. Maybe I'm not taking enough. 200 mg doesn't do much for me unless I take a NoDoz with it. That can't be healthy.,M,37,2  weeks,7/15/2005,Provigil

533, 1, excessive daytime sleepiness_ apnea,I have been taking this medication for about a year. When it works_ it works. However_ there comes a point when if I do not stop taking it for a few days_ it has the opposite effect and I have sleep attacks. I have been having incidents of insomnia for 6 months that may be caused by provigil. Also_ my migraines increased from on every one or two weeks to one a day. I also am experiencing muscle pain that may be caused by provigil.,The drug seemed too good to be true_ and I think it is. I think there are long-term side effects like amnesia_ sleep attacks_ severe headaches_ and possible muscle damage.,F,53,1  years,6/14/2005,Provigil
534, 5, apnea_ fatigue_ depression,Have had chronic depression for decades and none of the many antidepression medications I tried had any positive effect except for Parnate_ an MAOI_ whiuch was somewhat effective. I finally stopped taking Parnate to try other avenues.  (MAOI with Provigil is considered risky and untested.)  Also have sleep apnea and have used CPAP every night for 10 years.  Largely side effect free except slight  throat irritation which is surprising since my CPAP has an otherwise effective humidifier.,First two days were amazing. Became downright enthusiastic and perky after many months (years_ actually) of depression_ daytime fatigue_ body aches_ repetitive yawning_ suicidal thoughts_ etc.  Taking 200 mg in morning.  The amazing high subsided over the next ten days to the point where I now feel pretty normal which is a great feeling.  I am able to get things done_ get out of the house more_ interact with people more.  I am also motivated to eating healthier which has led to about 5 pounds weight loss in three weeks.,M,59,20  days,6/6/2005,Provigil

Before taking Provigil_ I'd come home from work and literally crash on the couch for 45 minutes or more.  Trying to wake up in the morning was near-impossible.  I'd stagger around in a sleepy haze for an hour or more.  I was late for work most days.  I had zero concentration and yawned my way through most of the day.  Now though_ I'm a totally different me.  Alert_ awake_ productive_ I've regained my self-confidence_ sense of humour_ and interest in socialising after work.

565, 5, Insomnia Problems,I have had severe insomnia for well over 8 years.  I am a married 35 year old female with no children.  I have tried every sleep aid available (both prescription and non-prescription). I participated in a sleep study and it was determined that I never reached restful sleep (I never got beyond stage 2 sleep).  I struggle to stay awake at work on a daily basis - the worst is trying to stay awake in meetings.  My boss is aware of my problem and is very supportive - I am lucky. However_ I attend other business meetings with people who are not aware of my problem and it is a very difficult situation.  Since none of the sleep aids I have been prescribed work well enough_ it is assuring to know that Provigil can aid me in my quest for a normal life. I am aware of the potential of becoming addicted and take Provigil only after a very very  poor night of sleep.  For me_ Provigil is a miracle.  I can function at work all day and no longer fall a sleep at the drop of a dime.  I have never taken more than 100mg and generally find that 50mg gives me the ability to make it through the day.
