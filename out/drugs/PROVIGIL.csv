3, 2, For idiopathic hypersomnia,Blurred vision,Worthless_ did nothing for my symptoms_ no energy_ continued brain fog_ still got sleepy thru the day_ no concentration _ trouble remembering things _ continued to have sleep drunkeness. Could take my dosage of 100mg twice a day and sleep 13 hours get up_ non rested_ and have to take a nap within couple hours. Nap would be couple hours long. Not the wonder drug for me. Was on adderal 30 mg once a day felt normal no buzz effect_ but developed tachycardia so my doctor tried this . Now we have to look for something else to try.,F,54,1  months200 MG,3/28/2016,Provigil
4, 4, Fatigue from Fibromyalgia/CFS,Headache_ most days. Weight loss initially.,I have been taking Provigil for a couple of years for extreme fatigue/exhaustion from fibromyalgia. It worked best in the first 3 month of taking it. I felt awake but not jittery_ very focused_ less foggy and less yawning. The only downside are the headaches I get from this drug. They occur 2-3 times per week on a normal week which is unfortunate. However_ due to my insane fatigue_ I was not willing to give them up. Two years later and it still helps keep me focused_ but it seems to wear off within a few hours. I lost about 20 pounds in the first 3 months as well_ which was nice. The weight has crept back on unfortunately. Still a good medication if you can tolerate the headaches!,F,39,2  years200 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Provigil

6, 5, Extreme fatigue-only up 6 hrs daily,@200mg to start stomach pain & nausea too much_but was super woman with speedy speech.  Had to cut dose to 100mg & can tolerate. A little nap or rest around dinner_but this medicine has given me my life back.  My stomach has been gurgling_but no pain.  It causes me to smoke more due to being up & a little more hyper_but I will get a handle on_because I was in the process of quitting.  My speech sometimes gets faster_but I think is leveling out some. Overall_this medicine has given me my life back.  Hope a tolerance doesn't develop May try to increase back to 200 later only if my stomach will tolerate it_so that I won't poop out in the late afternoon.  We'll see after another couple of weeks   Hope this review helps you,,F,60,4  weeks100 mg,1/22/2016,Provigil
7, 2, Mental alertness & wakefulness,Felt slightly more awake_  Light niggling headache_ Jaw clenching_ Spacey at times_ Foot tapping to average music_ Foggy head_ Staring off into space_ Difficulty concentrating_ Trouble focusing eyes.,Day One:  200mg at 1700hrs before a 12 hr night shift_ roughly 3 hours to feel noticeable effects. Felt slightly more awake_  light niggling headache_ jaw clenching (not cool for work)_ felt a bit spacey at times_ foot tapping to average music. Was like all the undesirable affects of MDMA without the good if that makes sense.Day Two: 200mg at1600hrs before night shift_ roughly 2 hours to feel effects though had less food in stomach.  Initially felt more awake than previous night_ very foggy head_ light niggling headache_ jaw clenching_ foot tapping_ staring off into space_ difficulty concentrating_ trouble focusing vision (again similar negative effects of MDMA) for those who have used.So far not overly impressed_ don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting a limitless pill type effect but hoping for something like a Dextroamphetamine type experience with that kind of focus and mental drive. I have also read that taking too much can cause some of the foggy head side effects I experienced so I will try half dose next time and see how that goes.I also received some Armodafiinl in the sample pack so hoping that it works better for me....fingers crossed!,M,33,2  days200 1X D,10/13/2015Email,Provigil
8, 3, suspected narcolepsy_ hypersomnia,Restlessness_ anxiety and sleep paralysis on the second day. No symptom happened again after that.,Might stop working after a few weeks if taken daily. Ideal when taken intermittently; stopping (or taking less) before returning to the suggested dose usually fixes this.,F,25,4  months100mg 2X D,8/17/2015,Provigil
9, 3, Mild Narcolepsy;TBI Hypersomnia; MS,Increased wakefulness; increased concentration; improvement in cognitive function; improved memory; Severe headaches; anxiety (which can sometimes lead to feelings of parnoia); intermittent tachycardia episodes; tremors; occasional OCD episodes; increase in pain level--and/or reduced effectiveness from narcotic pain meds; increased muscle spasms_ nausea,My review is identical for Nuvigil and Provigil: The medication is very effective for drowsiness and improved cognitive functioning; standard treatment for narcolepsy. However I am unable to maintain a daily schedule due to side effects: terrible headaches_ tremors_ negativity_ OCD_ and anxiety--Sometimes feeling watched or that people are working against me--even when I KNOW this isn't true. The combination makes me very irritable and not very nice to be around With daily use and higher doses I've experienced OCD episodes and panic attacks--probably triggered by physical anxiety_ which I've NEVER had before taking these meds.  It's terribly disappointing as hypersomia is ruining my life--NO one can get anything done sleeping. Worse_ when I take the nuvigil I either have to be selective as to when--so that my pain levels are relatively low--or up my narcotic due to increased pain and spasms.  Nuvigil & Provigil do what they are supposed to do_ but on balance the side effects are miserable_ even after years. With dr's permission I take them PRN--but they aren't as effective; So I live like Rip Van Winkle_ or suffer in pain and act like a nut_ pushing everyone away. I can't take anything sedating which means going without certain treatments.  Driving is out of the question.  I'm lucky that the narcotics don't sedate me (when sleeping 36 hrs I'm not taking anything let alone pain meds). Or eat. Or drink..Or let my poor dog out...FYI: Adderall and amphetamine were not helpful,F,59,  1X D,8/1/2015Email,Provigil
10, 2, MS fatigue,Took 3 weeks at 100mg before any noticeable effects. Upped dosage to 200mg at 4 weeks. Worked well for wakefulness_ but had increased anxiety and extreme irritability.,I'd rather be exhausted than awake and angry.,M,35,4  months200 mg,7/24/2015,Provigil
11, 5, Study aid,,No trouble getting to sleep when I wanted to. I have never experienced such high levels of focus and concentration as when I have been taking modafinil. The confidence it gave me when revising made me feel like nothing could stop me getting the grade I wanted. I would be getting through a workload five times as big as I could without it and just reading_ learning_ understanding and applying everything so very easily. Incredible drug. No side effects.,M,21,21  days200/400mg 1X D,7/4/2015,Provigil
12, 5, Narcolepsy,Not much. Probably contributes to my clenching teeth. I have a rapid heartbeat_ but I take Adderall too_ so can't blame it on the Provigil alone.,Provigil was a lifesaver. I initially started taking it due to sleepiness (they thought) from my Paxil. I had Tricare at the time so they covered it. After I divorced my military husband I got on a different insurance that required a pre-approval. That is when I had the sleep study and other testing and found I have narcolepsy. I actually take a combination of Provigil and Adderall. It is only 10mg of Adderall_ but something about the 2 together works amazingly.,F,44,10  years200 1X D,7/3/2015,Provigil

15, 5, Narcolepsy/Idiopathic Hypersomnia,My first week of taking the drug I experienced headaches and loss of appetite.  Those side effects faded and I have never had an issue with them again even going off and back on the drug.  I talk a little fast which might be a side effect but could be normal.,This drug is amazing for me.  I am not jittery_ I am not sleepy.  I can stop taking it any time I want to and will skip doses when I am sick so I can sleep more.  After careful discussion with my doctor I chose to continue taking it through my pregnancy and my son is perfectly healthy (I am not recommending this for everyone_ just offering the data since there is almost no information out there.  I would love to contribute my data to any research being done on this.).  I used ritalin while breastfeeding and prefer provigil because I had no side effects with it.  My biggest complaint is fighting my insurance every year.  The prior-authorization required for a drug I have been on for 10 years is insane and they mis-process the authorization all the time which leaves me rationing my pills and stressing out and calling everyone trying to find out who messed up.  I filed a grievance to see if I could get a waiver of the prior authorization requirement but they denied my request.,F,33,11  years400 1X D,4/10/2015Email,Provigil
16, 3, idiopathic  hypersomnia,Let me say to those out there that I had to fight w my insurance company all the way to a administrarive hearing level to get coverage. .. which I did  In the beginning_ and even still occasionally_ I get the shakes along w a headache and rapid speech. A few time some mild anxiety.,When I took provogil alone it did absolutely nothing.  Still falling asleep at dinner table face first into my plate.  Really. Dr. added adderall in late morning and a second dose around 2:30. Sometimes I glide right through the day with no problems; other days it seems I run from project to project and then back again_ barely completing any of them_  and then there are still other days that I feel as if the medication makes me more  drowsy.  For me it's a hit and miss.,F,51,6  months400 mg 2x,4/8/2015Email,Provigil

I gained it all back in 3 months.Im rethinking Provigil now.Maybe it goes weird when its in your system for too long? Is 6 years too long?,Its WONDERFUL at first.It starts very subtly_not like speed.It just seems like some ran a tab of estacy in a glass of water for like 3 seconds.But WONDERFUL! After 6 yers?

19, 1, Extreme fatigue,Rash_ all over. Started about an hour after taking. I would rather be tired all the time than deal with this rash. Took a claritin to try and calm it down.

20, 5, Bipolar Depression,Slight headache (only twice)_ diminished appetite,I have bipolar disorder and I used this while on Prozac. Prozac had got me out of the worst of a depressive episode_ but I still felt flat and with a mood that was always just below normal.  Modafinil made me feel slightly high_ properly awake_ and very motivated.  In other words_ it really worked for the depression_ and there were no scary side effects -  no mania_ no anxiety_ no risktaking behaviour_ no agitation_ no raised heartbeat or any 'speedy' effects. Also there was no sharp comedown - the effects just gradually wear off. The only negative effect a mild headache on two occasions and one paracetamol solved it. It makes you feel more mentally alert_ but I did not notice any increase in physical energy. The effect started within half an hour of taking 100mg and reached a peak about 2 hours later. The effects last for at least 12 hours_ so don't take it late in the day if you want to sleep. I took 200mg once and the effects were just a bit more intense and lasted at least 15 hours. After it wears off_ appetite and sleep return to normal_ and the next morning I felt normal.  I don't take it every day_ just when I feel I need it. I have not tried this when deeply depressed_ only when I was coming out of a depression_ so I can't say how it would work in that case. It certainly works in changing your mood from slightly low to slightly high.,F,55,30  days100 to 200 1X D,12/12/2014Email,Provigil
21, 4, Shift work disorder,At first lethargy_ headaches_ feeling of living in a fog with little to no emotions.,"After the initial ""trial"" period I have enjoyed provigil.

22, 3, sleep apnea_ grad school,"This medication is very peculiar. I think diet affects it_ because the side effects and overall efficiency change from day to day for me. I am definitely more alert_ and when I ""crash"" at night_ I fall asleep much more quickly. However_ I feel more anxious and slightly depressed using this medication. Also_ if I am very stressed (say_ having a big paper due)_ the anxious side effects are hightened to the point I am physically shaking. On the whole_ I am happy with the medication_ I just dislike the frequency of the side effects.",,F,33,1  months200mg,12/9/2014,Provigil

Am able to follow thru on tasks better and none of the side effects of ritalin eg. nervousness_ tremors etc). Note: my MD has prescribed 200 in morning_ which I take as very first thing before shower_ dressing etc  and a half tablet (100mg) by 2 or 3 in the afternoon if needed and I am still able to sleep at night.I do some shift work and long shifts (12-14 hrs) and this is a Godsend!

31, 3, Study enhancement for nursing schoo,I took modafinil so I could do well in nursing school. This pill is a miracle and aweful at the same time. I am horrible at math and learned almost an entire nursing calculations book in one week on my own. I have problems focusing and getting motivated. On modafinil I was so determined I would study for 15 hours straight time would fly by it was enjoyable and the material was easy for me to pick up and master. I also loved that I had zero appetite because I wanted to lose a few pounds. I lost 3 lbs in one week. I could go two days without eating and not affect me or have zero hunger pains I would have to force myself to eat. However_ on the 7th day of taking it my personality and thought process completely changed I didn't feel like myself at all! I did things and thought things completely out of character. I woke up with serious depression and anxiety (no previous history of that ever in the past) I'm not talking about feeling a little down or a minor knot in my stomach I'm talking hated life questioning everything gut-renching knot panic attack. I had uncontrollable crying for hours straight_ having a panic attack to the point where I was really struggling to breath_ couldn't focus_ mind racing_ racing heart (pulse rate was 138 resting) all while throwing up all day long. First day not taking it I feel a little better still have some anxiety and feeling down. I hope this isn't permanent because I absolutely can't stand this feeling.

Since taking Modafinil my ability to concentrate has increased_ analyticsl skills improved dramatically and mood is happy. I also like that there is no big ""speedy high"" and no overheating or sweating too much unlike Dextroamphetamines. Downside to Modafinil is that my productivity has decreased_ awake time & energy is decreased_  social life decreased and I obsess and overanalyze things way too much. Great if I want to be a professional recluse analyzing data all day but my career and life require me to be more social & awake.

40, 3, M.E. / sleeping issues / narcalepsy,I have battled with M.E./ extreme fatigue for 16 years. After having a child_ I needed to address and increase my wakefulness. At first I took 100mg at 8/9am_ and if I needed a boost_ another 100mg at 10am. This would wouldn't wake me up as expected_ but rather i would force myself to get going and then it would kick in. It would send me on a cleaning frenzy and did lower ones inhibitions. I soon started to notice that i couldn't settle at night_(hence me writing this now) and would become emotionally overwhelmed and low. I dropped the dose to 100mg a day if I had work_ which did help me_ but it was a struggle. I soon developed horrific migraines after i lowered the frequency of taking them. (twice a week for work or if i had a 'busy' day). I found if i took 50mg every couple of days_ and then 100mg on busy days_ it kept the head aches/migraines at bay. However_ part of my thinks this clashes with the Pill_ Yasmin. Since alternating days and lowering the dosage_ I don't get low moods_head aches and only mild palpitations. Though i still have trouble getting to sleep_ which resets the cycle if you like_ you need another pill to get up! I would advise NOT TO DRINK CAFFEINE AS WELL. This will heighten all side effects and give you the shakes and jumbled words/thinking. It is a life line to me_ but the side effects are many and do suck. Though i can honestly say_ i don't find it addictive. Its one to try and giggle about with a docs advice i think.,,F,28,2  years100-150mg,3/27/2014Email,Provigil

45, 4, Idiopathic Hypersomnia,Headaches_ Loss of Appetite_ Increased Thirst_ Chattiness,I take one 200mg pill of Provigil in the morning_ and it gives me a slight headache (which I can easily endure) and I can hear and feel my heart pounding when I am quiet. It works great when keeping me awake until about mid-afternoon after lunch. I then try to fight to stay awake. Will eat a snack or force myself to walk around_ or taking a regular vitamin-B pill will sometimes do the trick. I noticed though that if I drink coffee while on Provigil_ it gives me a more severe headache. The drug has made me more chatty and outgoing_ which annoys the person with whom I work closest and I may be a bit overbearing for some_ but others like chatty people_ so who knows. When I first started taking Provigil_ I took two (400mg) pills in the morning and one (200mg) pill around noon.  This was too much for me.  I was hyper and talked fast the first few days_ but by the end of that week_ I was lethargic.  I felt no emotion and had a more severe headache.  It felt dark.  It was a bit scarey_ so I pulled back and now just take the one pill in the morning.  Even though I still get a bit sleepy in the afternoon_ it's better than having to deal with the severe headache and lethargic feeling of the higher dose. I struggled with depression/suicidal thoughts at times while on Provigil these past months. Those went away after I prayed with another person.

It's AMAZING for fatigue and depression. I normally spend all morning yawning_ but never when I take Provigil. I feel energetic and have a better mood. However_ sometimes I have noticed that I become really chatty_ somewhat arrogant/obnoxious when I am talking to other people. It can make you irritable at times. I lost 15 pounds in 2 months due to lack of appetite (a plus for me). I get severe headaches 1-2 times per week I never had before. Plus it makes hormonal contraception less effective. So_ I am trying to determine if the positive outweighs the negatives of this drug. I love the energy and alertness_ along with weight loss_ but the other side effects really suck. I don't have any sex drive anymore and that is hurting my marriage. I may reduce my intake to ""as needed"" basis instead of everyday.",F,36,60  days200 1X D,9/16/2013,Provigil
49, 1, fatigue for MS,Nausea when it first kicks in_ no other effects until it starts to wear off then I felt jittery_ shaky_ irritable and sweaty,I had to fight so hard to get this prescription after my insurance initially refused to pay for it. Even still my co-pay for a two-week supply was $98 for the generic.I was so disappointed to find that this did absolutely nothing! I literally got no benefits from it whatsoever. I couldn't even tell I was taking anything_ except that I was a little nauseous and had heartburn during the first couple hours. It started to wear off about 5 hours after I took it and I was extremely jittery and shaky_ felt like I would pass out_ started sweating all over and felt really irritable. Maybe it was just because I took the generic_ but this drug was absolutely worthless for me. It's definitely not worth about $200 a month even with insurance.,F,39,5  days100 1X D,9/7/2013Email,Provigil
50, 5, Narcolepsy,NONE,Provigil  has given me my life back I can now function as others would.  I can get up take my provigil and walk my dog go out with my husband clean the house shop visit family things other people do.  I still at times fall asleep but not as often.  It is very frustrating to fall asleep even if for a short period of 5 to 10 mins.  You miss alot.  Furthermore the sleep paralyzation does not happen as often if I take my medicine.   I can work maybe 5hours a day now.  It has really improved my quality of life.  I hate that it is so expensive because I really need the medicine to be a productive part of society.  Anyway no bad side effects (except the cost) and I am very happy with the results.,F,44,10  years200 MG 1X D,8/15/2013,Provigil

52, 5, Shift Work Disorder,I've been taking Provigil because I've been working nights from 8pm-5 or 6am Sun-Thurs. Unfortunately since my employers health insurance has changed_ it now requires a (Prior Authorization). So having to stop taking it suddenly was not a major problem.  So started taking Ginseng Extract which definitely helps.,,M,58,9  years200 MG,4/13/2013Email,Provigil
53, 5, Multiple Sclerosis,If I don't take it as soon as I get up_ I won't be able to sleep that night.,I absolutely cannot live without this drug!  When I forget to pack it_ within 24 hours_ I'm a shell of a person.  My thoughts are scattered_ I could sleep for 16 hours (and I have!) wake up and feel as if I hadn't slept at all.  Provigil really has saved my life!,F,45,8  years200 mg 1X D,4/8/2013Email,Provigil
54, 3, Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertensio,drowsiness for first hour after dose_ hot flashes_ excitable heart_ sleep disturbances_ mild headache,Provigil is an okay drug. The side effects weren't so bad for me_ but the actual effects weren't much_ either. I did feel better than before_ but while Provigil was able to give me the PHYSICAL energy to stay awake_ I still felt mentally drained most of the time_ had a hard time concentrating as usual_ and wanted to sleep even though I didn't feel the urgent NEED to fall asleep. I still found myself having to supplement with caffeine. It was semi-helpful_ but not what I had expected_ and at such a low dose_ I wouldn't really consider it effective. I may request a higher dose in the future.,F,18,20  days100 MG 1X D,3/5/2013,Provigil

58, 3, narcolepsy,Itchy rash on arms and legs,I had taken Provigil several years ago for a span of about 3 months. Although it was a great alternative for my narcolepsy_ it was not generic and quite expensive.I opted for Concerta instead. Now that Provigil is generic (Modafinil)_ I began taking it again over a month ago. Not a single side effect at first and I as very alert with a natural feeling of wakefulness. Last week I developed a symmetrical rash on my forearms. The next day it had spread slightly and I applied hydrocortisone cream which helped a little. With each passing day_ the rash continued to spread and increased in intensity ( a maddening itch). Currently_ it is on my arms from the elbows to my wrists and on my legs from the knees to ankles. Oddly enough it feels as though I'm itching from the inside out! I stopped taking the med after 5 days of having the rash. I will be going back to Concerta. Nuvigil did not work for me (stomach discomfort)_ but it has helped my 16 year old daughter.,F,37,6  weeks200mg 2X D,1/4/2013,Provigil
59, 5, Hypersomnia_ ADHD (adult),I started this drug as a 19 year old for ADHD and initially had to stop it based on tachycardia (increased pulse). I went back on it four years later as I was diagnosed with hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness). No longer had the tachycardia side effect. It is what I would consider my miracle drug. Doesn't work too much for ADHD but for promoting wakefulness it great (for me). Also_ was on it in different doses ranging from 200-400mg a day (once at 200mg/day once_ and once at 200mg BID). Also have been on 300mg/day. 200mg generally works ok.,"Most recently in order to get approval for the med as my current insurance companies deny it_ I have to be off of it for two weeks to get a sleep study during the night and day. I've been off for three days and all I do is sleep. It's a bit ridiculous because when someone has hypertension_ he or she isn't asked to discontinue a blood pressure medication long-term to ""prove"" it. I barely function and sleep most of the day off of it. Also_ you can order from Canadian pharmacies online and they obtain it from India for a way cheaper price if your insurance company disapproves it_ just make sure to have an Rx.",F,26,3  years200-400mg 1X D,12/17/2012,Provigil
