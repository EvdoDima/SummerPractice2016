2, 1, Suspected deep sinus infection,Extreme tiredness_ loose stools_ achy body_ nausea feeling_ nervousness_ anxiety feeling_ very very weak and just feel totally out of it.,The first few days seemed okay.  Side effects crept in slowly as time went on.  I only made it 10 days out of the 14 day prescription - I just couldn't take any more.  My stomach has been destroyed after taking this.  I've had a few bouts of severe gerd and upper stomach pain.  Over all I just feel like I've been run over by a truck.  I just feel sick_ weak_ tired  and worthless three days out from stopping this stuff.  I will not be taking this again.  Ceftin is a powerful antibiotic that can take you down.  Be cautious before taking this_ doctors just write the script for this stuff and don't pay enough attention to what damage it does to their patients.,M,53,14  days500mg 2X D,7/9/2016,Ceftin

Today my jaw started hurting_ off and on_ on the left side.  This medication is doing weird things to my body.  I can't stop taking it because pneumonia and a 3 month bronchitis bug has been going around my work and I can't catch it.  I have asthma and have had a lung collapse about 1.5 years ago_ so my doc doesn't want to take a chance of me catching it or having my sinus infection get into my lungs.

Upon early return_ I was given Ceftin.  Didn't even have to finish the full ten day.  Learn your medications and how they affect you.  This past two days_ I felt the same vague symptoms of a similar bacterial infection.  Woke today with fever spiking_ horribly painful sore throat_ took 500 MG Ceftin 8AM and sat it out.  After only one dose_ I caught this bacterial infection in time so I will now continue until I see gastrointestinal reaction (which means the ""bad"" bacteria is gone and now it's killing the ""good"" bacteria.)  You have a responsibility to know your body and to know how it reacts to medication.  Any rash of any sort with any medication can be an emergency_ go to the ER.",F,66,10  days500 MG 2X D,6/30/2013Email,Ceftin
36, 1, Rash that had become infected,The first day I had no problems_ but the last 72 hrs have been pure hell for me. In addition to lots of really severe gastric issues (incredible diarrhea_ gas_ bloating_ and nausea)_ it has made me extremely restless and hyper_ both physically as well as mentally. For anyone who has ever had too much caffeine_ think of that and multiply it by 100. Not good. No matter what I do_ I can't seem to concentrate or sit still_ and found myself leaving work early today as things were so bad. I've also been having insomnia and pretty severe sleep disturbances the last couple nights. If I am lucky enough to fall asleep it's only for a short period of time (an hour or two at the most)_ and then I wake up not only all restless and wound up_ but feeling as though I'm losing control as well as my mind. I nearly came close to calling 911 last night because I felt so out of sorts. Never had to deal with side effects as bad as these and am planning on discontinuing them ASAP as soon as I talk with my do,,F,47,4  days500 2X D,5/23/2013,Ceftin

38, 1, Sinus_ ear & throat infection,This antibiotic is a tough one. I did ok the first week then got so sleepy & nauseated & joints ached. No heartburn with coated pills. I ate meals first_ yogurt & acidophilus but still felt awful. No strength at all. Had potassium checked & it was very low from this medication. Bingo! That's tiredness & muscle aches. Beware this lowers potassium & Blood pressure ( 115/60 ). I stopped the medication 3 days ago & am pushing high potassium foods & straying to feel human again. Works great on sinuses but too hard to tolerate. Good luck!,,F,60,3  weeks500,4/5/2013,Ceftin

40, 3, Pilonidal Cyst w/E coli infection,I was prescribed Ceftin after taking Bactrim and Keflex for 2 weeks. When the doctor found out my infection was e coli and not mrsa_ she prescribed Ceftin because Bactrim did absolutely nothing to it and the Keflex pretty much just suppressed it. I was prescribed 1 500 mg pill 2xday. The first 4 days were fine. I got a bit of nausea_ but nothing I couldn't tolerate. After the first pill on day 5_ I started to notice scaly little rashes all-over my arm. I ignored them..until I started itching all-over. I called my pharmacist and was told to take Benadryl and to go to the ER if I started having difficulty breathing. The Benadryl helped and I put hydrocortisone cream on my arm. That was two days ago and I am still itching. My arm looks like someone grabbed me and tried to squeeze my arm until it fell off.

Diff infection which was the worst experience of my life (30+ daily BMs_ incontinence_ bloody stool and a 3 day hospitalization for dehydration).,It seems to me that this medicine is extremely harsh and should not be prescribed lightly.,F,25,7  days500 2X D,10/11/2011,Ceftin
45, 2, sinus infection,No side effects_ but the stuff did not work at all for me.,If you want to get your sinus infection healed...talk to your ENT about ordering medication from Sinus Dynamics...they provide you with a nebulizer and a sinus medication that turns into a mist via the nebulizer to be sniffed up into the sinuses. They have a 90% success rate...many people that have had sinus infections for as long as 20 years have had success with this type of treatment.I am only on my second day of treatment and already can feel the difference. I have had a chronic sinus infection since 2003 and have been on anti-biotics just about non stop since 2003. I have had six surgeries in an effort to be rid of this sinus infection. It appears that I may have finally found something that is going to work for me. A topical treatment rather than oral antibiotics.,M,57,14  days500 2X D,10/4/2011,Ceftin

48, 1, chronic Lyme,My first 2 months on the drug_ I did great_ and indeed_ it cleared up my Lyme symptoms. The third month I started to develop some GI issues -- abdominal pain and bloody stools (I had never had GI issues before)_ so my doc recommended I stop the drug. GI issues stayed bad over the next couple months. Then I got a colonoscopy -- which showed that I had ulcerative colitis... and soon after I landed in the hospital for almost 2 weeks for uncontrollable intestinal bleeding. UC is a condition I will now have for the rest of my life -- and I am only 28!  Not to be overly dramatic but my biggest life regret now is taking that Ceftin.,Take probiotics while you are taking this drug. It can really ruin your intestines.,F,28,75  days500mg 2X D,10/27/2010Email,Ceftin
49, 3, Lyme Disease,Horrible diarrhea_ even while eating large amounts of probiotic yogurt every day.  And_ while not a side effect per se_ the pills were the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted_ and I had to coat them with peanut butter to get them down.,My doc had put me on Ceftin_ 500 grams twice a day_ because I was coming off a month of intravenous Rocephin (insurance paid for only a month)_ and still needed more antibiotic treatment.  Ceftin is the oral antibiotic most chemically similar to Rocephin and has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (what I needed at the time)_ and it was working.  Because of the diarrhea and risk of colitis_ however_ the doctor had to switch me from Ceftin and put me on Biaxin.,F,29,2  months,10/11/2009,Ceftin

On the eighth day of taking this_ I started experiencing a change in bowel habits; by the last day_ (day 10)_ I had diarrhea.  I ended up in the emergency room a few days after that.  I hadn't been in the hospital as a patient for anything since 1985_ so this is not typical for me.  Prior to this_ I had never had a bad reaction to any medicine.  I was told that it wipes out the flora in the intestinal tract_ giving opportunity for the ""bad"" bacteria to flourish.  I now have clostridium difficile_ a bacteria sometimes present in the intestinal tract_ but usually kept in check by the good bacteria_ from what I've read.
