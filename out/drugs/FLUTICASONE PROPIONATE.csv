0, 1, Psoriasis of the vaginal and rectal,I have been taking this medication and just made the connection that it is the reason I have been chronically ill for 6 months!  I have had terrible cysts at the application site.  Many infected.   Was put on so many antibiotics to cure the cysts that I now have had 3 bouts of c-diff.  Now I figured  out why.  The doctors couldn't.  Ugh!,,F,46,6  months2x daily c,8/16/2015,Fluticasone propionate
1, 1, Sinus infection,Cystic acne_ severe personality changes_ became combative_ depressed hearing reduced_ dizzy,I accidently dosed myself with HALF of the prescribed amount.  The first and worst of the cystic acne showed up about 6 hours after the fist dose. Never_ ever had acne in my entire life. As bad as that was_ turned out to be the adverse symptom that saved me. My personality changed so drastically_ my husband was getting ready to take me in for a psychiatric evaluation. He concluded there had to be a connection between this drug and these symptoms and got me to stop using it after only 3 HALF doses. If I had used the full dosage or not had these huge cysts_ I likely would have continued using it_ and ended up in a far more serious situation than a sinus infection. I wish I could say I'm exaggerating_ but I'm not. This was very scary and I have no idea how scarred my face will be from the cysts. If the rating system allowed for it_ I'd give a negative rating.,F,66,3  days50 mcg 1X D,1/15/2015Email,Fluticasone propionate
2, 1, Allergies_ Sinus Congestion,Having used several nasal sprays such as Flonase_ Flovent_ Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone being now described_ these drugs/nasal sprays_ their side-effects are very serious to be taken lightly. Now_ I see_ while my son when young taking Flonase was always having angry outbursts_ constantly mad especially with me. I am glad to have found this site_ as it explains it all. Thanks.From coming across this site_ it becomes apparent that Fluticasone Propionate was responsible for my constant having death thoughts; either someone I barely known have died or that individual was going to die. Also_ constantly worried that something bad was going to happen. Further_ I will get these sad feelings upon waking up from my sleeps. In addition_ I would have these constant itching on my back afraid that I might have caught something.,Having used several nasal sprays such as Flonase_ Flovent_ Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone being now described_ these drugs/nasal sprays_ their side-effects are very serious to be taken lightly.

3, 1, allergic rhinitis,extreme anxiety/panic attacks_ racing heart_ trouble breathing_ high blood pressure_ insominia_ fatigue_ sore throat_ trouble swallowing_ headache,I took 2 sprays per nostril once per day for the first 15 days. Then my doctor told me to increase to 2 sprays per nostril twice per day for 4 days. After that I went back to the original 2 sprays per nostril once per day. I ended up in ER on day 20_ feeling like I was going to die. I suspected the nose spray and stopped it the next day. The side effects cleared up completely 3 days after stopping the medication_ and I feel like myself again. This was a truly nightmarish experience!,F,42,20  days50 mg 2X D,9/28/2013,Fluticasone propionate

6, 4, ,I have not had any side effects whatsoever.  I have seasonal allergies but this year has been the worst.  The nasal spray appears to be helping but then again it could be that whatever I am allergic to has somewhat cleared up. Too soon to tell.,The brand I am using is the generic brand manufactured by Apotex.,F,59,6  days50 mcg 1X D,10/30/2010Email,Fluticasone propionate

8, 1, Sinusitis / Allergy / Stuffed Nose,Feeling of losing your breath especially during sleep (bad since nose stuffed) / Anxiety / Feeling of something bad is going to happen / panic attack / unable to sleep.,Didn't put two and two together until I read this wed site concerning both this generic and the brand name Flonase.  Thought I was dying / wife says I was over reacting but now I see I am not the only one experiencing these adverse reactions.,M,44,3  days50 mcg 1X 1X D,9/14/2010,Fluticasone propionate
9, 1, Allergies,My daughter's usual Veramyst was changed to this. Although this is considered a generic to Veramyst_ we found side effects that were different than she'd experienced. She experienced trouble falling asleep_ but when she did sleep_ it was fitful and her dreams were vivid. She'd wake up in a panic and felt beathless (so she'd think she was having asthma & take the rescue inhaler). We noticed that she was taking the rescue way too many times during the week_ so we watched her and began to notice that it seemed to be a panic attack instead. We also noticed daytime mood swings_ anxiety_ out-of-it feeling_ angry_ argumentive behaviour_ and mild depression.(Yes_ I know she's a teen_ but this was obviously related to what she'd been taking).,"Called the allergist who ""never heard of this reaction"". What did I think he was gonna say? He did say to take her off for a few days and see if she feels better_ that she might be sensitive to an ingredient that's in it. We did take her off and she's had 3 nights of good_ nightmare-free sleep. I read somewhere (maybe on this site) that these drugs are from the steroid family and can cause the reactions noted. She was experiencing what so many others here have reported.",F,13,2  months50 mcg 1X D,5/30/2010,Fluticasone propionate
