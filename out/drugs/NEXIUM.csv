2, 1, H.pylori/suspected GERD,Headaches_ increased anxiety_ nausea_dizzy spells_diarrhoea,Initially took this to help with constant cough due to h.pylori.and suspected GERD.

3, 1, Occasional acid reflux,I was only an occasional user so I couldn't understand what was causing the rash. The hives were relatively mild at first_ then severe. Itchy hands then buttocks then a nasty raised rash on body arms and legs. The last episode happened on holiday in Greece. I thought it was a heat rash but I then my lips swelled up_ I felt dizzy_ my heart raced - I was really worried as I could feel my throat getting tighter. I later realised that the reason for this occasional outbreak might be the Nexium and the comments on the Web seem to confirm this so I am not going to touch them again.,It works very well for acid but the side effect I suffered was very scary. I have never suffered any side effects from any other medicine. I am surprised this drug is available over the counter in the UK.,M,,2  days20mg 1X D,6/7/2016,Nexium

He used to come from work at 4pm and sleep until morning_ loads of sweat during sleep. All these side effects were increasing.

Before this visit my husband used to take Nexium maybe once a week but this doctor said it's ok to use it daily for a long time. One day when my husband felt extremely bad I decided to check the side effects of the pill he was taking_ and we understood what was the cause_ so thankful I found these reviews. We have thrown the pills and going to try apple cider vinegar for heartburn relief_ as there are a lot of good reviews about it. Please_ do not take Nexium. Try to find a natural solution.,M,31,5  years1 pill/day,4/22/2016,Nexium

15, 3, Presumed Acid Reflux,Initially no side effects. Then the following- dry mouth_ foggy head_ constant fatigue_ dizziness_ chest pain_ substernal pain_ back pain (including 2 trips to ER with one the drs thinking I had an aortic dissection)_ stuffed ears_ stuffed sinuses_ sore throat_ horrible taste in mouth_ altered stool consistency_ fluttering in chest_ breathlessness_ flu like symptoms.,Have been on Nexium in the past and it has helped with ulcers. So the drug has its good points This time was diagnosed with presumed acid reflux- initially put on Somac 20mg with no improvement_ changed to NExium40m once daily. No real improvement for 4-6 weeks_ then slowly symptoms of post nasal drip_ coughing_ breathlessness disappeared only to be replaced with constant bad taste in mouth after drinking water and severe chest pains_ epigastric pain and back pain. Went to ER twice had stress tests and angiograms to rule out cardiovascular disease. Xrays to rule out lung issues_ and ultrasounds to rule out other abd organ issues. Nothing found yet. Still waiting on barium studies and scope??? Discussed NExium being cause of signs with Dr who laughed_ and gastroenterologist adamant that it is safe. I believe the relief in symptoms of acid reflux was because I changed diet and lost 10kg and not the NExium BUT the Nexium is responsible for other side effects. HAve felt at times I was dying_ or have something seriously wrong with me but all tests come back NEGATIVE so far?? The last 2 weeks have had ribcage pain and back pain and flu like symptoms.

34, 1, GERD_ mild gastritis,lower abdominal pain_ fatigue_ diarrhea,Diagnosed with GERD after endoscopy (though never experienced heartburn or regular symptoms until briefly trying Prilosec OTC).  Originally given Prilosec/omeprazole by Rx_ but denied by insurance co. so given this instead.  Immediately caused constant lower abdominal pain (colonoscopy done at same time_ no abnormalities)_ unusual changes in bowel movements (usually extremely watery diarrhea)_ and noticeable sensitivity to temperature changes.  Told GI doc about reactions; nurse originally skeptical that meds were the cause_ even though issues started with PPI therapy.  Eventually switched to Protonix 40mg/day_ which was much more tolerable_ but abdominal pain remained.  Per family doc's advice_ got off PPIs a few days ago and returned to ranitidine.  Apply critical thinking when your doc tells you to take PPIs indefinitely.

Not until about 2 days ago did I realize that I started Nexium just before all these symptoms came on.  I never would have thought an acid reducer would have all these horrid side effects!  I found this site and realized almost everyone is dealing with the same exact things.  I've been off Nexium for about 2 days now and I'm still dealing with the side effects but I know this drug takes about 72 hrs to completely leave your system so I'm hoping and praying that these horrible feelings start to subside quickly!

64, 1, Esophageal erosions,Rib fracture_ low vit D_ numbness left face_ arm_ toes_ weight loss_ vivid dreams_ irritability,I was started on Nexium for esophageal erosions probably due to taking my aspirin without food and stress from the passing of my brother. When i tried to quit initially i made the mistake of taking digestive enzymes at the same time and thought i needed Nexium for life_ which was suggested by my gastroenterologist. Three years later i started with the side effects. This began with a rib fracture from a low trauma event. Then i started getting numbness and tingling of the left side. Was worked up for stroke and MS but this was negative. Thankfully I found this website and am successfully weaning off Nexium with improving symptoms. I cut dose in half for one week then every other day for a week then every third day til im off. In meantime am taking DGL licorice 20 min before meals and slippery elm tea before bed. There are alternatives. Consider them.

I didn't realize that I was having side effects because my doctor told me that I was ""mentally ill"". Dizziness for a few weeks turned into vertigo attacks. I'd feel like my body went limp_ so I'd start moving like a bat out of hell because I felt like I was dying. I'd have anxiety before falling asleep at night_ so I'd literally have to rock myself to sleep. The numbness was unbearable. My whole body would feel numb_ and I'd try pulling my hair to make sure I still had feeling in my body. Ear aches_ neck pain_ bone aches_ dry eye_ blurred vision_ jumping awake for no reason_ etc. The headaches were unbearable! I was convinced that I had a brain tumor_ and there were times that I thought I was going blind. I also got an itchy rash that had white pus in it.",I really wish that I didn't have the side effects on this medicine. It did help my reflux symptoms to an extent_ but the side effects were too much. I developed a bruise on my breast bone_ so I'll be paying a visit to my doctor.

Once you are on it it is hard to get off it. I tried once before but ended up back on it due to worse syptoms than before. In the end due to several severe attacks of abdo pain which was unbearable.  I am not afraid of pain by the way I have haf 10 children. The pain was so bad I would become delerious and passed out on one occasion. Very scarey. I came off meds cold turkeyNo choice as ended up in emergency room and the thought of another attack was hoŕrendous. I am 2weeks off and back pain is debilitating can hardly walk.

Then the pain became severe along with the twitching. Why did I never consider this medicine being a problem? I've been off for about 2 weeks and feel better than I have in 2 years. The joint pain and stiffness is almost non-existent_ thought my back is still tweaked. Brain fog is gone. Hopefully it will continue improving and I will be back to 100%.

81, 2, Acid reflux,Worked well for my acid reflux. After 5 days of taking this medication_ I began having some muscles soreness in my chest and a little in my arms. I thought it was strange that I was having muscle soreness for no apparent reason. I took extra strength Tylenol and it helped with the pain. The next morning I woke up with muscle soreness/tightness in my fore arms_ ankles_ and wrists. I also had soreness in my upper arms_ shoulder blades_ calves_ etc. Almost all over my body! I began to worry! I knew I had just started Nexium_ so decided to look up side effects. And there it was_ muscle soreness or muscle cramps! I was shocked! I immediately stopped taking it. It has only been about 36 hours since I have been off the medication and my symptoms are still there_ but not as severe! I am hoping in another 24 hours_ I will be back to normal! I would still recommend this product for acid reflux. With that being said_ it is important to look up all side effects from a medication. Everyone's body is different.

My doctor thought it would help my stomach pains from eating (I feel very full whenever I eat only tiny amounts). The first week on Nexium_ I felt no change for better or worse. The second week_ I started getting bad heartburn and acid taste deep in my throat. I stopped taking Nexium after the 14 day course_ and the heartburn and acid taste went away in about 2 days. I often have paradoxical reactions to medicines_ but I successfully took Nexium for heartburn while pregnant and at that time_ it worked wonders; I would have been miserable throughout my pregnancy without it (I stopped taking it the day my daughter was born and had no recurrence or rebound heartburn even though I had been on it for 7 months).

I blamed most of my side effects on my age although I couldn't understand why friends my age didn't seem to be having these difficulties.  I'm 5' 2"" 115 lbs and was fairly active before these issues began. The shortness of breath was a little scary and my doctor sent me for tests to rule out heart and lung diseases and everything came out normal. Over the years_ from time to time I would try to stop taking Nexium_ but each time the reflux was worse than ever and I assumed that I was getting worse. I now know that when you try to stop taking it after long term use_ your body will start mass producing stomach acid making you think you're getting worse.  I'm off of this drug now for about 3 weeks and feel so much better than I have in years.  I went through hell for a couple of weeks and used over the counter remedies to help wean myself off.

Every once in a while I would still get heartburn even while on Nexium.  But the pain from a heartburn episode (which would last hours no matter what I tried for relief) was so intense I was terrified to go without Nexium.  I thought I couldn't live with out it.  Recently_ my insurance company will no longer cover Nexium and because it's so expensive_ I've been forced to find other means of treating my acid reflux.  I was pretty upset about this at first_ but I'm beginning to think it was a blessing.  It's only been three days and I think so much clearer.  I suffered from constant brain fog_ but I blamed that on having a baby.  Virtually every symptom I was experiencing I was blaming on something else.  It's only been three days so it will be interesting to see if the decrese in problems continues and if my acid reflux stays under control.  If it hadn't been for my insurance company I would've been on this forever.

Give it time and after about two weeks that hyper acidity should disappear and you should be back to your normal self. For about three months I thought the Nexium had actually cured my heart burn and I wouldn't have to take it anymore but unfortunately the GERD slowly came back and I eventually had to go on to a similar product.,M,26,2  years40mg 1X D,10/15/2013Email,Nexium

Depending how it was covered under my insurance_ I had to go off it at times since it was not covered.  I have tried protronix_ prilosec_ prevacid (30 mg daily and 30mg 2x a day)  prevacid gave me horrible diarrhea.  Nexium has been the best.  My latest insurance company wanted me to try dexilant for a month before covering nexium.  Basically one 60 mg Dexilant is like taking two 30mg prevacids.  Didn't do anything but give me a cold after a month_ and lots of diarrhea.  I always come back to the nexium_ when things improve I ween off it taking it once every other day for a while to get off of it.  I have been getting my calcium and magnesium levels check every six months and they have always been fine.

I called my gastroenterologist and he said these couldn't be side effects from this medicine_ but I took the initiative to stop taking this medicine on my own and also had my magnesium level tested. I read on nexium website it could cause low levels of magnesium which could cause my symptoms. Well my levels were a little low and after about one week my symptoms started going away. I've altered my diet and do muscle relaxation exercises everyday to lower stress levels. I'm feeling totally back to normal now and my gerd is better most of the time.

It took two days to feel somewhat ""normal"" again. I switched to NEXIUM next thinking it might not be as bad. Within two days I started to be extremely fatigued. By six o'clock I couldn't get off the couch. My kids and husband thought I was getting sick. I didn't make the connection to the Nexium until day 5 when the headache and dizziness showed up again. I cannot begin to explain how awful this stuff made me feel! Not only that but I lost my appetite and in two weeks of being on this and Prilosec lost around 8 pounds.

It was restarted around three months ago.  Since this time_ I have developed ear ringing_ pain that wraps around my left side below my ribs_ vertigo_  disorientation.... What is worse is that my moods have gone totally erratic.  I came to this site when I typed in Nexium + ear ringing + confusion.  The ear ringing (a problem I've never had) has gotten worse over  the past 2 1/2 weeks.  I am going to see an ENT next week-- HOWEVER-- I must say that as one woman posted on here_ I have not been able to leave my house.  Everyone thinks I am just a nut case- crying_ depression_ confusion.... sobbing-- I won't go anywhere w/o someone coming w/ me and I can't drive b/c of the ear ringing and vertigo.  The stomach pain I have has only gotten worse.  It's ruining my quality of life- and messing up the home stability as well.  I typed in the drugs I have been taking along with ear ringing.  All of these crazy side effects that I read- I'm having.  Quitting the Nexium TODAY.  It certainly isn't helping-- and I will know over the course of time -- whether all of this is actually coming totally from the  Nexium.  Would I risk taking it???  NO.  I WOULD NOT.  PPI drugs seem to be monsterous for some of us.  Doctors don't seem to realize this drug is only to be taken 4-8 weeks.  I am losing it- and think it is the result of this drug.

My doctor gave me Nexium because she believed I had gastritis (inflammation of stomach lining). After reading the reviews on this website_ I was terrified of taking this medication! I put it off for almost 3 weeks because I was so frightened of all of the nasty side effects so many people said they had. But finally_ I decided I had to try the Nexium because I was tired of feeling sick all of the time. Within 48 hours of beginning Nexium_ my nausea was gone and my appetite was back! I think it's important to mention that I did NOT swallow the capsules whole - I have severe difficulty swallowing pills_ so I would open up the capsules and swallow the tiny beads inside with a spoonful of applesauce. I also made sure not to eat until an hour had passed. There were a few days where I ""cheated"" and ate when about 50 minutes had passed_ but I always waited at least that long. For the two weeks I was on Nexium_ I very_ very rarely felt nauseous and was feeling so good and happy to be hungry that I've already gained a few pounds back! And I had NO SIDE EFFECTS.

Hair loss on lower legs_ fatigue.,I had my 3rd ANA (anti-nuclear antibody) test completed in July for my diagnosis of Drug Induced Lupus from taking Nexium.  The result was a 4.2 (normal is 0.0 to 0.9).  My first test was a 6.2 in Nov. 2011 and 2nd test was a 5.1 in January 2012.  At this rate I will be better in about a year (hopefully). I am still experiencing pain in my lower legs and elbows. The pain in my legs moved to the outside and I have lost all my leg hair on the outside of my lower legs. This drug has caused a lack of quality of life for a year now. I am unable to do a lot of things I used to take for granted.

After I was done with the other two and only took Nexium_ my stomach pains were absolutely horrible. No acid though_ but felt like I'd swallowed a rock. It's an absolute misery. I'm on vacation_ and I'm stopping Nexium. I've had enough of stomach aches! When I get home_ I'll inform the doctor of my side effects which were worse than my original complaint.

I always had the skin rashes during my time taking Nexium_ I went to the doctor and got medication_ thought it was fungal infections that would not clear up. Over the last 2 years I developed extremely swollen_ red eyes.  They were always oozing and felt like I had sand in them.  I went to the doctor and they said it was allergies_ get rid of the pets_ clean the house_ allergy proof your house for dust mites.  We got rid of the cats_ the dog_ the birds (all found good homes)_ cleaned house constantly_ still took copious amounts of allergy medications and eye drops.  Nothing was clearing it up.  The one day a light bulb went off and my wife went online researching side effects of Nexium.  The claim was a very small number of people had developed conjunctivitis from taking Nexium_ plus skin rashes_ and all the other symptoms I was experiencing.  Immediately I stopped taking Nexium and within days the eyes cleared up_ the skin rashes cleared up.  After blaming our cats and dog for all this it was the Nexium all along...what a nightmare.  I then tried taking Pepcid AC and immediately my eyes reacted again.  I am now taking natural products to help my acid reflux and hoping for the best.

173, 1, GERD,Heart palpitations;anxiety;chest pain;burping;swelling in lower feet and legs;weight gain;tingling/numbness in head_face_left arm and hand;increased hypertension,As with others who have posted_ I came looking for this site because I noticed these weird symptoms and wondered if it could be the nexium. Well_ it looks like a big possibility. Those who have posted have noticed have the same symptoms as I and I think it's too much to be a coincidence. I never had any of these symptoms_ except the hypertension_ which is worse now (bp med was doubled 2 weeks ago)_ prior to taking nexium. I just refilled my next 3 month prescription_ but won't be taking it. I've been taking it for 3 months now_ and symptoms keep appearing and getting worse. I'm going back to prevacid. I took it for many years with no known side effects. Of course_ any of the ppi's will cause you to have severe rebound acid if you miss a day...that's the way that goes_ but I will never take another nexium. I can't wait to feel better. I actually made a trip to the E.R. because I thought I was having a stroke becaue I had the tingling and numbness of my head_ face_ and left arm. Half a day of testing and everything_ including a ct scan_ was fine. Now I see it is a common side effect of nexium.,F,51,3  months40MG 1X D,6/15/2012,Nexium

Managed with over the counter tablets (Zantac and Mylanta) then had a bout of bad pain in chest in 2010_ endoscopy showed a bit of inflammation in stomach so back on Nexium 20mg. Kept getting feeling of fullness in chest with a feeling of fluttering in heart like palpitations due to start but they never did. Came off  Nexium as it did not help and scared of losing hair again. March 2012 - bad pains in chest after eating anything so back on Nexium 40mg for 5 weeks and all symptoms returned only this time I had actual heart palpitations  which were severe for half a day_ strangely enough they stopped after I ate a tiny meal. Stopped taking tablets 6 days ago and palpitations have subsided_ feeling better_ more energy_ less anxious_ bloating  constipation and stomach pain gone_ but still the odd fluttering feeling which subsides after eating or taking a Mylanta tablet.  Saw Dr yesterday blood pressure high - never had blood pressure problems before.  Have now changed to Zantac which I was taking off and on before .  It is helping and can eat a little but pain comes on when hungry. Was told not to drink carbonated drinks which I don't like anyway but Ginger Beer/Ale helps immensely as soon as I have burped I feel fine!

I probably have some of the others mentioned on this site but I never connected them.,DO NOT TAKE this medicine.  The side effects progressively appeared making it difficult to say with certianty that it was the Nexium but as I have stopped taking it for approximately 10 days now I am noticing that the side effects are slowly coming off in reverse order of how I experienced them.  Within 2 months of starting my Prescribed Nexium treatment the side effects were severe enough that I was concerned and went to recieve treatment.  I was sent to see many specialist to try and diagnose my medical mystery.  ENT MRI of my Head No problems_ Cardiologist Multiple Stress tests/CT Scan Healthy heart normal age appropriate plaque buildup_  Pulmanologist/Lung Functions fine Sleep study OK_ Neurologist Nothing Noted possible need to adjust medications.   So 22 months later and tired of being told that I was just out of shape and could lose some of the 15 pounds that I am over weight I was at a loss.  I thought about the time period I started feeling sick and decided to search Nexium Side Effects.  Found another site that provided a long list and claimed that only approx 5% of those tested only experienced some of the mild side effects.  I started going through the list and one by one the sever effects matched or were similar to my own.  Stopped Cold Turkey and 6 hours after my next scheduled dosage.  Head pressure subsided_ headaches changed to feel more like withdrawal and I feel a ton better.  Still not done feeling the effects but I will NEVER take this stuff again.,M,43,2  years20MG 1X D,5/10/2012Email,Nexium

183, 1, gas_ bloating.,The bloating and gas symptoms that made me go to my Doctor in the first place have always seemed to get much worse when taking Nexium. The second time I was on it I stopped taking it after a month and felt so much better. I went back to my Doctor and told him as much and he assured me it was not the Nexium that made me feel worse. So here I am 18 months later back to Doctor with some tummy issues...... prescribed Nexium again..... have had hidious bloating_ belching and pain_ especially up under my ribs. I spoke to Doctor yesterday and asked if the Nexium could possibly be making me worse... emphatic NO. It was in desperation that I found this website_ what a relief to read other experiences similar to mine. ,I took my very last Nexium ever yesterday.  I am booked in for an Endoscopy in 2 weeks time but hoping to be feeling better by then. Quite frankly_ over the past 8 weeks Ive had myself convinced the Dr will find some terrible disease but_ on reading what others have experienced on Nexium I'm feeling much more optomistic.

185, 1, Life long GERD,Severe muscle pain_ joint pain_ bone fracture_ whole body aches and pains_ hypertension_ ears ringing.,I was prescribed Nexium for GERD that I had dealt with my entire life. Even as a young child_ I had almost daily reflux and severe heart burn seemingly regardless of what I ate or drank.  In hindsight_ my family should have bought stock in Tums and Rolaids_ we were never without them.  When I was 27_ I decided to talk to my doctor about a better alternative to over the counter remedies which frankly_ weren't really working anyway.  He prescrbied Nexium 40mg once daily.  At first_ I thought that I should have done something about my GERD long ago because the relief provided by Nexium was immediate and effective.  After about 3 years of daily use_ I began experiencing arthitis like joint pain in my elbows and hands at first which has since spread through my entire body. I also suffered a stress fracture in my left tibia while jogging (max 10kms).  Neither my family doctor or my chiropractor could believe that I could fracture my tibia so easily with no history of bone density issues and very good general health. I also developed severe_ tendonitis like symptoms in my right elbow (and to a lesser extent in my left elbow) which have greatly impacted my ability to do simple tasks like carrying anything heavier than a few kilos with my right hand.  And I'm right-handed! Further to these issues_ I have elevated BP and a ringing in my ears so loud that I swear people around me can hear.  I was given a 1 week trial of an alternative (can't remember the name) which did work_ but has si,M,31,4  years40 1X D,4/27/2012Email,Nexium

219, 5, anxiety and stomach inflammation,none,the trick to taking Nexium is for people to read the instructions. take it first thing in the morning 1/2 hour to one hour before eating or even drinking coffee. I found out I had inflammation thru endoscopy because I was going crazy with Panic attacks and anxiety. Small Hital hernia will do these things as well. Before judging this medicine ( not saying some people will have side effects) _ you really should find out why you are taking it. For heartburn_ try tums or mallox or eat more Alkaline foods ( stop acidic foods such as tomatoes and coffee). Do not eat before bed. Do not lay down after eating. I have been there? If you continually suffer from anxiety or panic attacks_ it might be worth doing endoscopy and it is simple but will give you peace of mind.Our stomach nerves are the center of all communications in the brain_ and any trigger in the stomach will let your brain go on the defense and so a small thought is magnified and all of the sudden_ we go crazy.if you feel tingling in arm or leg before this_ check your Blood sugar as well ( prediabetics have this).

221, 2, hiatus hernia_ severe gastritis,Sleeping problems_ tingling/numb hands and feet _ headaches_ weight loss,The only reason that I entered my info on this website is because the information that I found here was so useful_ it literally changed my life. I owe it to others to share my experience.I developed oesophagitis and severe gastritis_ had a scope done where they then also discovered a hiatus hernia_ which explained the heartburn and refux. Got a prescription for 40mg Nexiam. In addition I changed my diet_ lifted my bed_ stopped all alcohol consumption_ etc. After 6 weeks there was only little improvement. I then started using Siberian Pine Nut Oil together with Nexium and after 2 weeks all my gastritis symptoms were gone.  I stopped the oil and continued with Nexium and was very happy for a month or two.Then the problems started: Headaches_ tingling/numbness in hands and feet and sleeping problems. Everytime I stopped taking Nexium_ the reflux/heartburn came back. After six months of trying different things I decided to go off Nexium gradually_ 1st month down to 20mg_ then 20mg every second day for one month_ and then stopped completely. In addition I changed the following: Everytime I feel the heartburn or reflux I have a few almonds (I have about 20/day; I buy them in 1kg packs)_ I have dinner at 6pm and never eat anything for 4hrs before I go to bed; I never drink anything 30min before or after a meal. For me these are the 3 most important changes I made to deal with my hiatas hernia.Today (1 year later) I live a normal life_ have the odd glass of wine or beer_ eat,M,48,6  months40mg 1X D,11/18/2011Email,Nexium

The doctor prescribed me with nexium 40mg once daily_ which was supposed to settle all these symptoms down. However_ the only thing the nexium did was settle the reflux. It made the bloating_ wind and pain worse. It just lingered on and on for the last 2 weeks_ so I decided to stop the medicine to see what happened. Most of the symptoms disappeared within 24 hours_ but the diarrhoea and malaise is still yet to stop.

234, 5, acid reflux,None for 8 years; had an unusual numbing headache so i stopped Nexium but don't know that the headache was caused by the Nexium.,"Started with 40mg; Nexium was a Godsend.  Eliminated acid backup and vomiting. Reduced dosage after three years to 20mg.  Worked beautifully and allowed me to eat most things_ eating sensibly--not overindulging in acidic or garlic filled recipes and greatly minimizing intake of chocolate and carbonated drinks.  Because I prefer not to take meds_ I tried eliminating Nexium on 2 occasions; I also tried taking it every other day.  My gerd returned and was only controlled with the prescribed levels of Nexium.  Prilosec offered no relief.  After eight years of taking Nexium_ I felt very well and experienced no reflux. I've had bone density tests every two years_ and my bone loss is normal for a person my age.  Recently_ I experienced an unusual headache_ a sort of numbness when I touched my forehead.  Was it the Nexium?  Or was it stress?  Don't know_ but I again discontinued Nexium.  The headache has not recurred; the acid reflux has not recurred.  I recommend Nexium; whatever the cause of the headache doesn't matter.  It encouraged me to be ""drug free"" and my Gerd is hopefully cured!",F,68,8  yearsstarted 40 1X D,8/15/2011Email,Nexium
235, 1, acid reflux,extreme heel and foot pain_ muscle and tendon inflammation_ muscle fatigue and stiffness in hips/trunk muscles_ fibromyalgia -like symptoms,after years of taking rabeprozole_ my doctor switched me to Nexium.  Within a few months I developed severe heel and foot pain_ severe hip muscle fatigue and stiffness_ stiffness and pain in my ribcage/trunk muscles.  I went to many doctors who could not diagnose anything; I saw 3 different foot doctors.  The heel and foot pain were so severe_ all I did was sit on the couch.  After running out of Nexium and not taking it for one week_ all my severe symptoms disappeared; I had suffered for 3 yrs_ and it was miraculously gone after just one week of stopping the Nexium.  I still have residual pain in my trunk and hip muscles_ but the severe foot pain is 100% gone.  I now have osteoporosis from the Nexium blocking calcium absorbtion.  I still have residual muscle and tendon inflammation_ but not as severe; I am seeing my doctor today and will have my calcium and vitamin levels checked_ as I suspect that it was is causing my muscle problem.  When I looked online for the side effects of Nexium_ every one of my symptoms was listed_ even though they were under the heading of 'Less than 1% of the population will experience these side effects'.

240, 1, Reflux,Headache_ heartburn_ heart attack like symptoms.,Was prescribed Nexium after having bouts with some pretty sever problems swallowing. My doctor believed I might have acid reflux even though I wasn't getting heartburn. The first time I took it_ I got a bad headache and got bad heartburn within minutes of eating. It seem to help the swallowing issue in that it wasn't as bad or last as long. After 6 days of taking Nexium_ I noticed that it seemed like my heart was racing and I was feeling dizzy and confused. When I woke up the next day_ my heart started racing again and by the time I got into the shower_ I started getting light headed_ felt a tightness in my chest_ upper left arm_ shoulder and jaw_ numbness in the fingers on my left hand_ weakness in my legs_ shaking in my hands_ and having difficulty breathing. I immediately got out of the shower and sat down on the floor. I couldn't get up to call for help. After about 20 minutes_ the symptoms seemed to improve and I was finally able to get up and get a neighbor to run me to the ER. After 3 hours and many tests_ the ER doctors told me that they couldn't find anything wrong and discharged me! By that time I was feeling very weak but much better. That night_ all the symptoms came back and after about 20 minutes they were gone. This was on  Friday and I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday so I will update this if I can.

I went to my GP when the symptoms got to the point that I was afraid of stroke_ MS or other nasty possibilities. He ruled out stroke and sent me to a specialist who wants to do an electric nerve  test. After reading the information here_ I stopped the Nexium immediately. It has been two days and the panic attacks have subsided and I really think the tingling and numbness is subsiding as well.

I wish I had found this board about this class of drugs before started it. While it may have provided temporary relief for my silent acid reflux_ it caused a laundry list of negative side effects.  For the time I was on this drug (4 weeks)_ I basically had a 4-week long diarrhea.  It was a terrible experience.  Nexium caused my body to stop absorbing any nutrients.  I lost 8 pounds in a hurry and I am not overweight and did not want to lose weight to begin with.  After reporting these side effects to my doctor_ he advised me to stop taking Nexium.  Getting off of this drug was equally difficult because of the ""rebound effects""_ which include GERD (which I didn't have before)_ water brash_ and periodic pain after a meal under the middle of the rib cage where the stomach is (which was unusual for me).  Since I stopped taking Nexium 2 months ago_ these rebound effects have come and are now largely subsided_ hopefully forever.  I am still trying to gain back some of the weight I lost.There are many many more homeopathic or natural remedies for GERD_ acid reflux_ or silent acid reflux.

I stopped taking it yesterday.,F,56,3  months40 mg. 1X D,3/24/2011Email,Nexium

266, 3, GERD,Wasn't aware that some of the side affects were from the Nexium. It cleared up my reflux the first couple years_ but then it didn't seem to have the 24 hour coverage anymore. I was afraid to go off it because it seemed to be getting worse.,After I had been on nexium for about 8 years_ I started getting tingling in my legs and arms and thought it was a vascular problem. Even went to a vascular surgeon who performed veinous closure procedure on my leg. Then my calcium level dropped to critical levels last year and that's when I was diagnosed with Hypoparathyroidism. I decided after going on calcitriol and reading about the effects of nexium on this drug_ to wean myself off nexium. When I did this_ my calcium level jumped. I don't have an official diagnosis of this yet_ but my guess is when I went off the nexium_ my parathyroids started working again and I didn't need the calcitriol. I think this drug should be recommended for short term use only. I am going for a bone density scan next month to make sure my bones haven't been effected.,F,51,10  years40mg 1X D,3/22/2011Email,Nexium
267, 3, h pylori infection_ GERD,Slight dizziness (minor symptom compared to vertigo_ relaxed (little bit drugged)_ sleepy_ sometimes hard to keep eyes open having to blink a lot,I've been treated for h pylori and it's my third day on the Nexium tablets. First I was prescribed Omeprazole for my acid reflux/GERD symptoms which made my condition WORSE due to the fact that I was infected with h pylori. I developed stomach ulcers_ I woke up in the middle of the night with a tight pain in the middle of my stomach which radiated out to my back so I couldn't sleep. It only felt better once I got up and I also had severe hunger pains 1-3h after my meals which continued until I started taking the antibiotics to kill the bacteria. I haven't had as bad stomach pains but I still have the acid reflux with pains in my throat which comes and goes_ I have also felt some small pin stabs in my lower stomach but not sure if it is related to the medicine or my condition (probably the condition) and the hunger pains have since seemed to have disappeared but it is still early days. One thing I have experienced taking both of the proton inhibitors_ Omeprazole and Nexium_ is that I feel slightly dizzy and kind of relaxed (like after you've had a couple of drinks). I have asked my GP who says that anything minor is not something to be worried about. I am only suppose to take Nexium for a week to see if the symptom has got better.Since I've had to change my diet and eating small regular meals I have lost about 4kg in a month either due to the condition or because I've changed my diet slightly. Not got anything to do with the medicine I don't think.,F,35,7  days20 mg 2X D,3/19/2011,Nexium

269, 1, Hiatal Hernia/Chronic Heartburn,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!My doctor (as is yours) is in the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies who give them perks for prescribing this GARBAGE. I had pizza every night so naturally I had heartburn...poor diet choice. I mentioned it and she promised me this would be a miracle drug...started on pantaloc but was switched to protonix due to abdominal pain. Protonix worked the best until it was no longer carried by my pharmacy so I took Pariet instead. Pariet didnt work for the silent reflux as I had chronic throat clearing. Switched to Nexium which worked for a while at 20 mg but then I needed 40 mg then 2 40s a day. After this stopped working I was switched to Dexilant. Didn't work either. I had through the entire two years post nasal drip_ chronic diahrrea_ fatigue_ depression....you name it I had it. I am a very talented singer and this has really dampened my career as now the drugs dont work anymore and the acid came back with a vengence and I have been without a voice for a week,This drug is absolutely horrible. There is no excuse to be giving this to humans or any living creature. Simple dietary changes are ALL IT TAKES people. I have a hernia so I have it worse_ but there are OTHER options like hernia massages to push it back in. Acupuncture works as well. Alkalize your body! We are the only culture with a massive GERD epidemic! Its our DIETS...makes you wonder if the drug companies and food companies are in bed together...all these high fat foods we cant digest_ what do we expect?,M,22,2  years40 mg 2X D,3/19/2011,Nexium
270, 1, GERD due to systemic sclerosis,Heart palpitations_ chest pains_ racing heart_ extreme anxiety.,I ended up in the ER because I thought I was experiencing a heart attack/failure. The first 6 months I was on it weren't bad_ no significant symptoms. The last 3 months the symptoms appeared and got worse and worse. I was having heart palpitations all the time and my heart was constantly racing. I started experiencing chest pains as well(mild). I had an overwhelming sense of anxiety which I had never experienced before. All of these symptoms continued to get worse so I decided to go to the ER. They ran EKGs_ CK blood tests_ Echocardiogram and all returned normal results. I wasn't having a heart attack/failure and the doctors were a bit stumped.Then I started reading up on the internet after my wife had seen a show on PPIs. I then came across this site and was shocked to see how many Nexium users were experiencing some of the exact same side effects that I was. I never would have guessed that a PPI medication could cause such things. I have been off Nexium for almost 2 weeks now and I feel like a new man. The heart palpitations and chest pains have disappeared. The anxiety has disappeared. I really feel like my old self again. Thanks to this site and the people that posted their experiences_ I have all of you to thank or I would still be clueless as to what was causing all of this. Nexium may work for some folks with no issues_ but for me and some others it's poison. I will never take another Nexium tablet as long as I live.,M,40,9  months 1X D,3/17/2011,Nexium

274, 3, GERD,Severe frequent headaches_ lightheadedness (like I was going to faint)_ dizziness_ numbness on my left foot_ fatigue_ chest pain/tightness_ shortness of breath_ bleeding in between menstrual cycles.,I started taking Nexium when I was rushed to the ER for stomach problems. Turns out I had GERD. The doctor prescribed Nexium. After a week on it 1x/day_ my symptoms did not get better so my primary care physician upped my dosage to 2x/day. After about 2 weeks I noticed that I was having really bad headaches almost everyday_ accompanied by dizziness. I complained about this to my doctor because I was struggling at work and she said I have vertigo. About 2 weeks later_ I was on the train when all of a sudden I felt like I was going to faint.  I felt lightheaded throughout the day and it made me feel very weak. This continued for 3 more weeks until I couldn't take it anymore and finally saw a neurologist. I had an MRI..everything came back ok. I've also had shortness of breath_ trouble burping and chest pain/tightness. I've been scared_ nervous_ frustrated and depressed for the past 2 months. I've been googling my symptoms trying to find answers until one day I thought...what if it's the Nexium that's giving me all these symptoms? I had a follow up appointment with my gastro yesterday and I told him about my symptoms and immediately he said it was probably the Nexium that caused all of this because he too has acid reflux but cannot take Nexium because it gives him bad headaches. He prescribed Dexilant 60mg 1x/day instead. This is my first day off of Nexium. Not sure if Nexium was really the cause but I just hope I start feeling better.,F,26,9  weeks40mg 2X D,3/10/2011,Nexium

276, 3, Yes,"While on Nexium (and previously Protonics_ another PPI)I never really acheived a ""24hr Happy Stomach"".  It did indeed take away the reflux I was experiencing at that time.",All these (PPI) drugs do is make the underlying issue(s) tolerable (which at that time in my life I definately needed it).  Nearly ten years later I decided to think about the long affect these drugs may have on my liver/bones etc.  So I decided quit cold turkey.  I took my last dose March 4_ 2011 and so far I have experienced the dreaded Reflux rebound.  I have tried many things to remedy the acidity such as Papaya_ Acid cider vinegar (tablets)_ aloe vera_ and ginger root extract - all of which seem to help.  Oddly enough the best remedy was crushed ice and tons of water.  Hope this helps!,M,30,9  years40mg 1X D,3/7/2011,Nexium
277, 3, GERD,heart palpitations,I have a theory of why some of you people have problems. I am NOT a doctor_ so please ignore me if you think I am incorrect. Nexium is made for severe heartburn problems. I've seen a lot of doctors doing 40mg very easy. My theory is that doing Nexium *might* make your stomach system entirely acid-less. Over a few weeks_ your esophagus *might* start swell up because of the missing minimum acid level_ thus creating some problems at organs/veins close to the esophagus. I myself has experienced this and have had success in lowering the dosage of Nexium. This *might* explain how some people get afraid of their heart when using Nexium over long periods. It's just a matter of how effective nexium is_ from person to person. If it's too effective_ you might want to e.g. take Nexium every 3rd day or similar.,M,35,2  months 3X W,3/7/2011,Nexium

It is very life altering (the effects have really affected me drastically)  - I really want to wean myself off of this.  Hopefully I will feel much better.

Recently I ran out of Acibac and I had to start taking Nexium again until I could get more.

Doc presumed it was a uti. As soon as I returned I went in for a urine culture that come back negative. But the bladder pressure was still there and getting worse. It was constant! I then went to my ob/gyn to see if the problems were related to costs or other female reproductive issues. She sent me for an ultrasound and everything came back perfect...but_ the pressure was getting worse. I racked my brain trying to figure out what it may be and the only med I was on was nexium. I stopped taking it and within 2 days the pressure was gone and I feel great!

I'm also keen on Lansoprasole.,F,26,30  days 2X D,11/15/2010,Nexium
308, 5, GORD,Dry mouth but not as bad as some other PPI's_ nothing of any note really.,Excellent medication that helps with acid or reflux. Some of the comments on here are silly and make people uptight. If you need help try this medication if it's not for you try another but if you have severe reflux etc you need to take something to make life bearable and Nexium works really well.,F,52,6  years40mg 1X D,11/7/2010,Nexium
309, 1, GORD,This website has saved my sanity!  Over the past year I have gone to hell and back.  I have had 2 MRI scans due to one sided numbness_ sensations in my legs (like something crawling over me)_ an overwhelming urge to sleep_ insomnia_ tingling in hands & feet - the list was endless.  Both MRI scans_ thankfully_ came back clear but this still left me with symptoms of an unknown cause.  It was only by chance I came across this website and I read that some people were experiencing the same symptoms as me.  I returned to my GP with a print out from this website and he has now changed my medication.  I can finally live again!  My one concern is - why do you have to take a list of current medication to a neurologist and they don't even bother looking at it.  If HE had researched it perhaps it would have saved the NHS two MRI scans!!!!!,Leave well alone!,F,42,12  years20mg 1X D,11/5/2010,Nexium
310, 3, bleeding ulcers from NSAIDS,In the beginning very bad headaches_ nervousness_ horrible vivid dreams_ back ache and just yucky feeling.,I was taking Motrin for DDD and siatica and arthritis for about 1 yr. It was suggested I take a PPI but I didn't want to take any more pills because I am so sensitive to side effects. I wound up with 3 holes in my stomach from bleeding ulcers. The ER had me on Nexium IV (it did stop the bleeding) and I had to take it for 6 wks after. I have 2 more wks on this stuff and although my body is getting used to it I can't wait to go off. My dreams are like Alice in Wonderland I have no idea where they are going to take me_ I am just happy I wake up. I am a light sleeper but this med has me in a deep dark place and I often have such a dry mouth while sleeping I feel like I'm going to choke to death_ combine that with where my dreams have me it's a scary experience. My Dr wanted me to stay on it forever or another PPI and I begged him to let me do without. As long as I don't take asprin or any NSAIDS I should be ok.   After the first wk my head felt like it was in a vice the headaches went away and I take both doses in the am so that most of it has worn off before I sleep (not really but anything to distance my self from it) It has I think healed my stomach thats a good thing_ but long term on this stuff would be a horror.,F,57,45  days40 mg 2X D,11/3/2010,Nexium

Unfortunately I needed it more and the heartburn attacks were extremely painful if I stopped for any length of time.Nexium helped my IBS which was a bonus.,My doctor switched me to pantoprazole and metoclopramide both these drugs gave me extreme diarhea_ stomach pain and bowel pain.

319, 4, stomach ulcers_ reflux,After several years Nexium repaired my stomach ulcers but the reflux remained.Several years ago I began suffering severe anxiety but hypnosis therapy has helped a great deal to a point where I no longer have it. During this period I had every test possible from blood to MRI as anxiety has many side effects e.g. heart issues_ vision_ nausea_ and severe dizziness (vertigo) but of course there was nothing really wrong with me just caused by anxiety (keep in mind I never_ ever considered that nexium could be the cause). Then my reflux got worse and my doctor recommended a higher (double) dose of nexium to 40mg 1 per day - surprise_ surprise_ anxiety began to surface even worse than before.Did hypnotherapy again which has helped but not with the severe_ extremely severe vertigo.This continued for over 12 months and somebody suggested the Nexium could be the cause since everything else in my life and day to day activities were ruled out.I tend to believe this may be true,,M,39,8  years40mg 1X D,10/1/2010Email,Nexium

Still a bit shellshocked from the whole Nexium experience (see previous post) but I have an appetite again and have only had one episode of the nausea_ gnawing stomach pain that sent me down the Nexium Highway of Hell in the first place.  I will be telling everyone I know to steer clear of this horrendous drug.  Awaiting my Helicobacter breath test result.  If its positive I'll have to find an alternative treatment to Nexium.

I broke several teeth and have had lots of cavities_ I had chronic back and leg pain_ I have constant gas attacks and am embarassed by it frequently.  My chiropractor recommended that I have a bone density test performed and it showed that I had osteoporosis.  I was shocked.  That was about two years ago and I have been on a calcium building regimen since.  I need to get off of this drug and am seeing my Dr. in a few days and asking to have my dosage reduced to 20mg.  I have tried stopping 'cold turykey' but the acid reflux comes back with a vengence_ much worse than it ever was before.

It took 3 days for the chest pains to stop but the hertburn stopped immediately_ i still have a little bout of it here and there though. At first i was having nightmares and was always stressed about how could this happen to me_ but it wasn't the nexium it was me because im upset i cant drink coffee! so i dont think it actually causes depression. but anyhow i still have all symptoms of gerd except long lasting heartburn and i have to watch what i eat very carefully because any little thing can upset it. i want to try and get off of it if the doctor approves.,F,25,7  days20MG 1X D,9/23/2010,Nexium

I am so glad to have found this website.  I never dreamed it could be her medicine.  Her GI doctor has told me I need to ween  her off of Nexium and give her one every other day.  I really hate that I have to keep giving her something that may be causing all of these problems but I don't know what else to do.  She has been on it for so long I am not sure how long it may take for the symptoms to end.  I sure hope this is the answer.

326, 2, Gastritis caused by generic Fosomax,Achy flu like symptoms such as fuzzy headed_ achy_ headache_ diarrhea; anxiety_ depression_ loss of appetite_ occasional cough from itchy throat_ middle and right upper back pain_ burning eyes.,I started taking the TEVA brand of Fosomax (Alendronate Sodium) 7 months ago.  This was prescribed by my doctor after the results of a bone density test showed mild to moderate bone loss.  After I started taking it (can't remember just when) I noticed by stomach becoming less tolerant to spicy food_ alcohol and pain relievers (occasionally for sinus headache). I eventually had to take an antacid to take a pain reliever. This all peaked with stomach pain_pain under right breast_ and  flu like symptoms (including diarrhea) so bad I had to seek professional help.  Before I went to the doctor_ I researched the Alendrate Sodium side effects (only prescription med I take. Wow! I was stunned to read about all the problems with this med. I had an ultrasound of my gall bladder - negative.  So I was diagnosed with gastritis_ and my doctor said it was good that I quit taking it_ as the drug did cause these problems.  To back track_ he was closed for 2 weeks when this happened_ and I had to go to a clinic first.  The clinic gave me enough Nexium samples for 2 weeks until I could see my PCP. My PCP gave me enough for 3 more weeks.   I have been off the Nexium for only 3 days.  I still have stomach pains - but I take Mylanta.

Then I had a constant dry cough with heart palpitations. Saw heart specialists who told me I had no heart problems_ he suggested I resume Nexium. The heart palpitations and coughing stopped almost immediately. Now 6 weeks later_ still taking Nexium_ I have the cough back and am trying to ween myself off Nexium.

328, 1, Hiatus hernia and heartburn,Joint pain_ muscle aches_ tightness in esophagus_ pain under rib cage_ tingling of arm and hand.,The first capsule I took was like a miracle cure--no more hernia pain and no more heartburn.  Too bad that wasn't the only thing it did!  The first side effect I noticed was a tighness in my esophagus---felt like everything I swallowed was just stuck and not going down.  Then I began waking up in the night and my left arm would be tingling and I wasn't even sleeping on it!  I thought that was weird and almost thought I was having a heart attack. Next came the shortness of breath and the feeling of being squeezed if I inhaled deeply.  I have degenerative disk disease and am pretty used to living with a dull backache.  When my ribs and sides ached even more_ I just attributed it to the disk disease progressing.  It wasn't until I came upon this site last night and started reading what others had posted that I realized that maybe the Nexium was causing all these other problems.  Today is my first day not taking it and I have not felt the throat tightness_ rib aches or muscle aches.

Couldn't breathe and turning blue in the face. Scared the wife to death!I was originally on Aciphex_ which stopped my life-long battle with indigestion overnight. Had to switch to Nexium due to the military no longer providing Aciphex. The only difference I've noticed is with Aciphex_ if I missed taking it for 2-3 days_ the indigestion comes back. With Nexium_I'll notice it sooner (1-2 days). No insomnia_ no depression_ no nothing except a calm stomach that never bothers me any more.If it works_ take it. If it doesn't_ don't. Otherwise_ risk getting Barret's Syndrone (like me) that can lead to cancer!,,58,3  years20mg 1X D,9/7/2010,Nexium

Now back to 20 mg. The reflux has gotten better as long as I eat smaller meals during the day and refrain from eating 3 hours before going to bed. I also feel that the oesophagus is healing slowly though I still have pain in the throat. I am not sure about the gastritis_ will find out after my next gastroscopy. But while I do feel a bit of improvement_ I have also developed all these side effects as listed. But reading other people's experiences has helped me to see that its not all in my mind. All these people cannot be wrong. Unfortunately when I spoke to other Doctors for their opinion on side effects_ they still thought it was the best drug despite the side effects. Doctors are trained the same way and they cannot see things any other way. I will try homeopathy and other natural remedies but most of all_ it is better to deal with other issues in our lives such as stress and emotions in order to get genuine healing. Nexium only treats the symptoms. But I am still taking it for the time being..before I swallow it every morning_ I pray to God to bless it so that this drug works in my body despite its weaknesses. But certainly not something that should be taken for a long time.,F,52,3  months20mg daily 1X D,8/11/2010,Nexium
335, 2, severe gastric reflux,At first on 20mg all was well_ though I was tired more than usual. After a bad reflux episode_ doctor upped me to 40mg day_ and I have felt unwell ever since. I get a headache about an hour after taking it_ and feel exhausted_ sleeping 10hrs day_ and quite depressed. I put this down to the actual reflux itself_ but now I'm thinking it may be the nexium. I'm back down to 20mg_ and am switching to Acimax 20mg today.,I don't think_ for me_ Nexium is a viable long term option. I just feel too awful_ with the fatigue and depression gaining momentum. I'm going to look into natural therapy options. I already take Slippery Elm Bark powder_ mixed with water_ 10 mins before eating. This apparently makes a protective lining of the digestive tract. I believe my reflux is caused primarily by stress_ so looking into meditation. My doctor seems to think I should take Nexium indefinitely_ but after finding this site_ I won't be. The long term effects are frightening. Thanks for all the feedback.,F,31,45  days20 then 40 1X D,8/9/2010,Nexium

337, 4, acid reflux,Nexium eased a very bad case of acid reflux_ I could not even sleep at night.  After about four months I started to have my arms and legs fall asleep_ especially at night.  The tingling would wake me up.  I also began to get trembling in my legs at night.  I stopped using the nexium_ thinking I would taper back to every other day.  But my acid reflux was much better and now I just take Zantac twice a day.  I drink a gatorade or powerade every day_ it seems to help my stomach quite a bit_ and helps with the vertigo I was having.

This is not the first time I have been on this drug_ but this was the first time that I had an adverse reaction to it.  Now this means that I can no longer take ANY Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) since they all have the same active ingredient(s).

After a gastroscopy doc found Barretts. Barretts as you may know is one step before cancer! He put me on 20mg_ that was in 2003. Now in 2010 I'm on 40mg a day and I have a list of all these other symptoms! I also now have multiple polyps!!  The interesting thing people is that the medical aid don't like paying for Nexium because it's so expensive here in Africa; and they insisted I have the PH test_ which was done over a period of 18 hours. I'm very glad I had the PH test!  The result was that I had reflux 75% of the time_ yet only had 'mild' reflux then and was not aware of it! - but diagnosis showed 'Barretts'.  It's possible to be ignorant of the level of reflux you're experiencing and the damage it is doing to your esophagus/stomach. If you decide not to use Nexium because of side-effects_ make sure you have a gastroscopy regularly! Whether you are aware of it or not the reflux is doing some damage! Don't be ignorant about your body!  Because of the threat of cancer in 2003_ I will have to weigh up the options and make an informed decision.

341, 4, GERD,Soreness_ pain and heavy feeling on left hand side of lower stomach some days worse than others.  Constipation. Low Mood.,I have found out that Nexium stays in your body for 72 hours from the time of taking so when you have gotten over your original oesophagitis_ I would recommend only taking one tablet every 3rd day (I take 20mg).  I have been doing this for two weeks and the bad symptoms have improved by 90% and and the heartburn has largely kept at bay.  Any heartburn developing after the 2nd day I have treated with antacids which have worked well.  I recommend this method as it keeps the drug in your body but at lower levels at all times.  I wear loose fitting clothes_ don't each or drink anything after 9 PM_ sleep with bed raised at head and also a Medslant wedge pillow  (which is very comfy) and I hardly drink alcohol_ cafinated coffee or tea_ fizzy drinks_ orange juice or anything very acidic.

343, 1, GERD,Yes_ it works_ but...I have developed a stomach full of polyps from using Nexium so long.  For the last 3 years I have had to go in every year and I have them removed because they grow rather large.  At least no cancer yet.,If there's any way you can avoid this drug do it!  I've read that 3 out of every 11 patients on PPI drugs will now develop stomach polyps.  Also_ it's almost impossible to get off of.  There is a major rebound of acid that will be far worse than any symptoms you have when you start on it. Try enzymes_ probiotics and DGL tablets.  Try to get at the root of the problem and heal your gut instead of masking the symptoms. Wish I would have known this before I started taking it.

345, 3, reflux possible ulcer,I was having severe reflux with additional acute pain in my stomach. I was put on nexium which i had used 3 years ago with no major side effects. This time i wasn't so lucky. My symptoms began with headaches_ nausea_ and extreme anxiety. The Anxiety in particular creates a feeling of despair and depression. Before i realized this medication was screwing me up i winded up in the emergency room because of what i later found was my body creating an over abundance of gastric acid to supplement the supression nexium created. I could not eat. I had a cracker and toast for 3 days.I went to my primary doc who said i now had severe gastritis. She put me on prilosec which essentially did the same thing. I quit these PPI immediately along with the carafate (no side effects with this does not go into blood stream) My doctor advised me that even though my body was rejecting food I still needed to feed myself bland foods (potatoes_ rice..) This along with drinking small amounts of half and half milk,My advice would be take this short term (no longer then 2 weeks) and start on some natural remedies. Half and half milk. I'm lactose intolerant but 1/4 of a cup of this does wonders. A small pc of apple after a meal. Stick with bland foods for a week after getting off the PPI's. I've also been taking probiotics as well as a papaya enzyme prior to eating meals with meat. good luck on your recovery!,M,39,2  weeks40mg 1X D,7/2/2010,Nexium

I now have Barretts Esophagus(BA)as a result of the acid relux. Nexium has been working fine for me with no side effects but if you suffer from side effects speak to your doctor. If you have a serious problem with acid reflux dont just stop taking your medication and hope things will get better. Natural remedies dont always work and serious health issues such as BA and Cancer are a real life threat so please speak to a quality doctor.,M,38,4  years20mg 1X D,6/15/2010,Nexium
350, 1, GERD,SEVERE eye pain/pressure_ light sensitivity_ dizziness_ paresthesias_ increased tremor_ fasciculations_ insomnia_ anxiety_ neck pain_ generalized musculoskeletal pain_ chest pain,THANK YOU! The comments here helped me to discover the cause of my symptoms (after spending thousands of $$ seeing specialists). Most of my problems started initially while taking Prevacid. I switched to Nexium due to diarrhea. While on Nexium_ the severe eye pain/pressure continued (MISERABLE). In addition_ I would be extremely light sensitive and dizzy. I also developed paresthesias (mainly left arm)_ worsened tremor and fasciculations. The insomnia was unbearable_ and I was on edge with anxiety. I developed worsened neck and back pain_ as well as generalized musculoskeletal pain_ chest pain_ and severe AM joint stiffness. After discovering an association with Prevacid and microcytic colitis (found on my colonoscopy)_ I began investigating side effects of Nexium. After seeing this site_ I immediately stopped the drug and the musculoskeletal problems improved within a few weeks. The eye pain lingered for quite awhile but began to improve after a couple of months. I am a high functioning individual who was very debilitated by Nexium (and Prevacid). These drugs are labeled for short-term use_ but are prescribed daily for long-term use without a second thought. Most people think they are benign. In fact_ my gastroenterologist was shocked to find out I was having problems.  BEWARE OF PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS FOR LONG-TERM USE!,M,36,30  days40mg 1X D,6/15/2010Email,Nexium

My teeth are disappearing away and I am facing terrible dental because Nexium is causing my teeth to be eaten away in a matter of 1& 1/2 years. My top front teeth are more than 3/4 gone_ reduced in size and w/o replacement and pulling or caps I will loose them all. Without my knowledge of the causes that the medicine could do nor did the company that makes nexium say anything about this in the side effects.,Im having terrible pain and facing expensive cost to have them repaired or replaced.ANYONE taking the medicine should contact their dr because it could happen to you also.I have also read about bone loss and people having brittle bones because of this medicine!,F,59,2  years40 mg 1X D,6/11/2010Email,Nexium

My hunger was completely ruling my life.,F,22,3  weeks40 MG 1X D,5/20/2010,Nexium
358, 3, Barrett's Espophagus,Initially I thought Nexium was a wonder drug. After being diagnosed with Barrett's Esophagus after an endoscopy_ I found the results very positive. As time went on_ I started developing severe abdominal cramping and constipation. The cramping was so bad it would wake me up in the middle of the night. My tinnitus worsened and my knees began to ache.,Nexium increased my hunger and I had food cravings from the time I got up until the time I went to bed.

360, 2, GERD,Bad stomach pains_ gas_ diarrhea_ back pain_ arm numbness,Within 1 day nexium had completely removed my reflux_ and I was really happy with it. After about a week of taking it_ I noticed my back started hurting_ which is odd given my age and the fact that it's never hurt before. After two weeks_ I began having bad stomach pain all the time_ muscle pain_ and horrible gas. It was more debilitating than GERD_ so I have thus gone off of nexium. I would never have known the cause without this page and everyone else having the same issues. I definitely do not recommend this drug; stick with tums or pepto bismal_ it may not work as well_ but it's a small price to pay vs. the horrible side effects of nexium.,M,28,14  days40 MG 1X D,5/14/2010,Nexium

363, 3, acid reflux,Nexium took away the acid reflux_ but after years of complaining I was constantly hungry_ after years of gaining and losing up to 72 pounds_ I finally discovered on line that 'increased appetite' is a side affect. I read the paperwork about Nexium when I first took it_ and don't recall that side affect. However_ it ruined my life. I was hungry 24 hours a day_ it took over my life. I told myself almost every waking minute not to eat. I was diagnosed as depressed. I slept a lot because you can't eat when you're asleep. Then last year my hair got brittle and over 1/2 of it fell out. My fingernails got brittle and I've had trouble with them ever since. I'm going to the doctor Thurs to tell him he_ and all the other doctors I complained to_ missed this. It was the Nexium. Now that I've stopped taking it_ I'm no longer insanely hungry. I'm hoping my hair and nails recover now. What a nightmare!,Don't take it.,F,55,12  years40 mg 1X D,5/10/2010,Nexium

What a difference... farting went away and I feel much healthier.  And to think that I was considering getting the Fundoplication loosened because I that it was causing ALL the flatulance.  In a nutshell_ Nexium not worth it for me...

I waited two days and took it in the morning...same effect. Called doctor and spoke to nurse who put me on Prilosec OTC. No adverse problems.

Terribly uncomfortable.  If I'd have know that this was the trade off_ I would have kept the heartburn.  The doctor didn't mention anything about negative side effects.

Over years i started taking anti acids now and then.  I became sick and due to continuous vomiting caused my surgery to fail 6 years ago. At that time i began using Nexium on an as-needed basis. Over a year ago_ my physician advised me to take 40 mg daily because of the knowledge of my surgery failure. After that time_ i was diagnosed with H phlori and had the medication doubled to 40 mg x2 daily. With all the information i have read_ i decided to quit Nexium_ however_ upon attempting this_ I have had more acid and discomfort than ever before - I am questioning if this drug created a dependancy that would not have been present if I had chosen to not to take on regular basis.,,F,51,6  years40 2X D,4/13/2010,Nexium

374, 3, Gerd,Neuropathy_ lower red blood platelets,I started taking 40mg per day_ but after experiencing side-effects_ such as neuropathy in feet and now fingers_ which I attributed to Nexium_ I reduced it to half a tablet every other day. This works most of the time.   I also take cholesterol lowering medication and synthyroid_ so I have no proof that the adverse effects are due to Nexium. Unfortunately_ every time I have tried weening myself off_ I have experienced unbelievable pain from gerd.  However_ recent blood tests are showing a very serious drop in red cell platelets and my doctor has no solution other than to assume it is due to one of the  3 meds I'm taking_ with Nexium being the prime suspect. As others have said here_ Nexium cures gerd_ which is a horrible condition_ but it seems unavoidably evident it has serious long-term effects. Live long with pain_ or live less without it seems to be the only options.,M,64,10  years40mg 1X O,4/12/2010Email,Nexium

After 8 years on this drug I ended up with_ a multi nodular goitre_  subclinical hyperthyroidism  diagnosed with Chronic Fatique syndrome_  and now after 18 months since that diagnosis I now have Fructose Malabsorption.  My side effects are _  fatigue_  pins and needles. Dizziness_ headaches_  stomach upsets_  brain fog_ lack of concentration_ general feeling of being unwell.,After 8 years on this terrible drug I saw many specialists and had many tests over a period of 3 months.   Now that Ive been looking at this drug on the internet Ive stopped taking it 2 weeks ago.  Since then I have had terrible re-bound reflux but I am starting to feel better.

Nexium proscribed and worked great for this. Definite B-12 deficient now and my surgeon has given me shots for this as you need acid in the stomach to obsorb B-12.... Now I have severe hair loss with no other explanation.  Tried to get off this drug last year 'cold turkey' due to other symptoms and became so ill I had to start back....Now I will try to ween myself off the drug slowly (and my primary doctor & surgeon both agree).....Yes_ it is very addicting and hard to quit_ but the bloating_ stomach pain_ fatigue_ muscle cramps and now hair loss is the final reason I MUST GET OFF THIS DRUG PERMANENTLY. And_ I take ONLY NEXIUM so there is no doubt Nexium is causing most or all of these side affects.  I will try over the counter tums_ mylanta_ whatever it takes and go strict diet_ small portions and eliminate trigger foods such as chocolate_ wine_ acidic foods and nothing after 6 pm. I also gave up my job last year_ retired from 31 years due to side affects that I believe now_ are due to the Nexium_ and after reading these comments.   There HAS TO BE A WAY to stop Nexium!!!

Unfortunately_ this did nothing for my rectal ulcer_ which my gastroenterologist suspects is because of Crohn's disease. CT scan and gastroscopy revealed nothing of the sort_ but he is determined to find a diagnosis.I am curious as to how soon my body will adjust to normal after getting of this drug_ I am a week away from no more Nexium! Yay! I am looking forward to this_ as well as the repeat gastroscopy that will confirm the stomach ulcer has gone away. I don't care if it hasn't_ I only want to stop taking pills every morning and feel like I have nothing left to live for.

After just a few days_ I started getting all these symptoms and stopped. They pretty much went away until I got Strep throat for which I was prescribed Antibiotics at that point the doc figured my shoulder pains were Tendonitis (because x-ray was normal) so he gave me anti-inflamatory_ and since both pills (antibiotic+anti-inflammatory) irritate the stomache and intestines_ he recommended I take the Nexium to coat my stomache before taking the other 2. I figured I'd do it for the 10 days that I need to take the antibiotics but all the side affects came back immediately. Just generally feel like a disaster.

(What it feels like_ not necessarily what it is.)",DX of severe reflux just five days ago.  On that date I took my first pill.  No noticeable consequences.  The next day I took pill #2.  That evening my left leg was achy.  Throughout the night I slept poorly and was achy.  The morning after I woke to terrible lower back pain_ hip joint pain_ and pain running down what felt like the center of my thighs.  It was so uncomfortable it brought tears to my eyes.I took a hot shower which alleviated the pain temporarily.  I spent the rest of the day taking Tylenol in order to alleviate the pain.  I ended up taking pill #3 this day.  I was sleeping more upright per doctor recommendation_ however this third day I decided to sleep normally_ to test out if this was the problem rather than the meds.  It wasn't.  I slept poorly again with a lot of ache and pain.I did not take a pill on day #4.  I did need Tylenol throughout the day as the ache was still there.  I slept a bit better last night_ but still woke up with ache_ though not as bad as previous days.I am currently waiting for the doctor's office to open so that I can get an alternative prescription.  I am also waiting to see how long it takes before the pain goes away completely.

I quit Nexium cold turkey. I got an electric bed to elevate my torso. The first couple of weeks were not fun but I made it. I have been Nexium free for almost a year now. I don't eat chocolate because it's a smooth muscle relaxer and promotes reflux. I take a vitamin B complex for the peripheral neuropathy. The leg pain and hand tingling is gone but I still get tingling in the feet if I don't take the B complex every day or every other day.

I didn't know what was wrong with me but considered it could be the Nexium. This validates my thinking. All medication has side effects_ but it takes time for them to become apparent and also to figure out what is happening with our body. It has become clear to me now. However_ it did help eliminate my GERD_ but I am going another route.

392, 4, Have LPR,Within 7 days of beginning use legs felt like lead weights.  Could hardly walk.  Ankles and feet were unable to bend and flex.  Bones hurt.  Pain sometimes on right side of breast. Developed pnemonia for the first time in my life 8 weeks after starting.  Dr insists I be on it 2 more months and he will drop me down to 1 time a day.,"Dr didn't feel that the articles on the pnemonia were proven.  I want to get off this but tried and the reflux was so bad I had to take it again.  Advised my Dr I want to have surgery to fix the hatial hernia and looks like you have to have the fundo with that.  Its a complicated problem and no easy answer.  I am beginning to think that having surgery to ""try"" to correct the problem (although a crap shoot) would be worth trying rather than accepting being on this scary drug.  Hoping to get a acid test soon and maybe I can move toward surgery.  This is a nightmare problem that I can't believe there aren't better options beimg worked on. After my Dr told me that he didn't have any idea what was wrong with my legs and feet and to go see my primary Dr I took it into my own hands and researched and added B12.  The legs and feet immediately felt 98% normal.  I'm scared to death every day I'm on this but feel I have no options and Drs have no orientation to exploring other things with you.  You are on you own.  I'm a healthy person with a anatomical problem and its now effecting the very essence of my biology.  Your meant to have acid in your stomach and it does so many benefical things to maintain a healthy life.  The problem is a hernia keeping the lower spincter open.  Why would drugs be the 1st option?

I was prescribed flexiril for the joint and chest and back pain and told I just had anxiety - ""typical for women my age."" Nevermind I have never had anxiety before Nexium. The doctor perscribed Klonipin. All 4 ""doctors"" prescribed anti-depressants for my Nexium induced depression and not a single one suggested that Nexium might be causing my problems. One night I was so depressed I began plotting my suicide (nevermind I wasn't depressed before Nexium). I decided I needed to stop thinking like an obedient patient and start thinking like a lawyer again. What's different in my life now that wasn't here before? Nexium.

Almost felt like I was depressed. I had trouble hearing and connecting with people. I found I was becoming increasingly more fatigued and lethargic. Today_ I reviewed my medications - what was new? Why was I feeling so bad? I thought of nexium. Stopped taking it today and told my son. He found this site and nearly fell of his chair. Virtually everything listed here has occurred to me over the past few months and it is becoming worse each day to the point I was scared. Two weeks ago_ we thought I was having a heart attack. My son was with me and luckily I have my own blood pressure monitor and we could see what was happening to me.l I am absolutely sure that this has been the cause of my problems.

My dad was admitted for observation but other than hooking him up to a  Holter monitor and blood tests_ no other treatments/tests/medications were performed or initiated.   Whether through ignorance_ laziness or incompetence_ the nursing staff did not give my dad his Nexium throughout his 3 day hospital stay. Remarkably_ he started  feeling better; no dizzy/fainting spells_ no radiating upper left hand gastric pain; no racing/pounding heart. Generally speaking_ just feeling better. Still not making the connection between his symptoms and the Nexium_ he started taking it again upon his release from the hospital. The next two doses produced dizzy spells that culminated with him fainting_ although neither as dramatic as the one that sent him to hospital. Given the nature of the comments on this site_ it seems prudent for him to consult his G.P. before he takes any more Nexium.,M,70,15  days,12/29/2009,Nexium

Upper and lower endoscopy failed to reveal any significant pathology so treatment took on symptomatic approach.  Decrease the acid and the pain will decrease was the operation definition. After taking the first dose_ he experienced a very small reduction in abdominal pain. The doctor started him on a daily dose of 40 mg. Almost immediately the nature and position of his abdominal pain changed. While he still had the diffuse abdominal pain_ he now had sharp_ focal pain in the region under the left side of his rib cage which radiated to the middle of his back. He also had a feeling of trapped gas in his stomach and upper gastric region that went unabated with belching. Approximately 1 week into taking the Nexium_ he had his first dizzy spell and fainted. He went very pale and weak; his pulse was racing and his pounding but he recovered within 5 minutes. Because his is a Type II Diabetic_ it was thought that the fainting spell was probably due to low blood sugar ( my dad had not been eating very much b/c of his abdominal pain ). The second fainting episode sent him to E.R. During this event_ besides becoming very weak_ pale and tachycardic_  he had an extreme drop in blood pressure and a mild and short-lived seizure.

No problems from the NEXIUM so far and no more holes(ulcers). I changed my diet and even gave up my beloved Bud Light but this change still did not stop the acid reflux. For me the only thing on the market that works is Nexium. I have tried many over the counter drugs in between refilling my prescription for Nexium and within a week I am feeling ill again.

However_ a week after being discharged and starting this drug_ I started getting stabbing pains in my stomach bad enough to wake me up in the middle of the night. Once I discontinued my use of Nexium EVERY SINGLE ONE of these symptoms disappeared within one week. If the ulcer happens to act up_ I take a swig of Maalox before bed and I'm fine.

I was confused_ as my research indicated that palpitations could be side effects of Nexium or symptoms of GERD. I finally went off Nexium after 10 months and sought help from Dr. Richard Ash(NY) after hearing him field a question on GERD and Nexium.  He stated that someone should not be eating foods that are the equivalent of ingesting glass while masking the effects with Nexium.  I saw Ash 3 weeks ago and began his diet and supplement program.  I have been absolutely totally symptom free for the past 2 weeks.  Palpitations gone and I am breathing freely through my nose which I was never able to do.

After being on Nexium for about a month/month and a half TONS of other ""symptoms"" began to present theirself little by little. Because of the increased abdominal pain my doc then recommended I up my Nexium to 80mg a day!. I ended up in the ER on 3 sepreate occasions with chest pains_ rapid heart rate_ and SEVERE abdominal pain. I had every blood test done imaginable_ CTs_ EKGs_ and MRIs... All coming back normal!!

Gall bladder removed because of the constant pain_ 5 visits to emergency room for heart palpitations_ and pain.

I am eating small meals_ try to eat before 6 PM_ use over the counter meds and I am doing 85% better.  I do think Nexium healed in the beginning any erosion I had to my esophougas_ but I think I took to long.,I have seen Doctor and basically he stands by Nexium_ he will not admitt to any knowledge of side effects_ but I understand his opinions.  If you have damage the nexium would be the med to take_ just watch the time you take_ change your lifestyle_ Nexium is the best alternative for those who either suffer the disease of acid reflux_ and risk cancer of other damages.

I was taking 40mg and only had one week in that time period of not taking it. I will be honest and say that it did provide me with relief initially but in recent weeks I have had several of the symptoms described by others here (see symptoms) A couple of times I was sure I was having a heartache or something else serious was presenting itself. I felt absolutely dreadful. Now that I have stopped taking Nexium for this past week_ I cannot begin to tell you how good I feel. The GERD symptoms are only slightly noticeable and I have elevated my bed. I am also taking apple cider vingar/honey and it is also helping the acidity. I was not aware of the dangers of taking it for too long - I remember my pharmacist mentioning that some people are on this drug long term.

Very efficient in suppressing acid reflux. This summer_ I began salivating a lot and having a thick throat. GP ran major blood tests_ all normal. So GI doctor put me on twice the does (Nexium 80mg)_ and then all hell broke loose. Huge fatigue kicked in and leg muscle pain. Muscle twitching. Palpitations and racing heart so severe that I was put on carry-on cardiac monitor! Loss of sleep led to anxiety and depression_ I became unable to work_ ended crying of despair. I had more bloods tests again_ scans of my throat and nose_ antibiotic runs_ nothing work_ and not one doctor made a connection to side effect. I researched_ discovered this site among others_ and once I stopped Nexium_ muscle pain_ fatigue_ and palpitations ended in 48 hours_ I can sleep again_ and I'm back to work.

Took a good 6 weeks to get out of my system and I can safely say I am now feeling my old normal self again. And I have had no reflux returning so I was taking Nexium unnecessarily all that time.

Tingling and slight swelling of hands.,Wasn't sure if these side effects were the Nexium or not_ but when I found this board_ I became convince they were. The one that concerned me most was the swelling of the neck where it meets the collarbone. I was a little reassured by the fact that the swelling is almost certainly not a lymph node_ because I can't feel a node_ hard or soft. It's more of a larger swelling that seems to be an accumulation of fluid. Of course_ one can never prove that the side effects are from the drug_ but in this case_ I feel confident that Nexium caused it. Unfortunate_ because the drug was working perfectly for me as far as reducing the reflux and heartburn. But the swelling concerns me too much to continue taking Nexium.,M,45,9  weeks,9/25/2009,Nexium

461, 2, Gerd as a result of hiatal hernia,Dizziness_ Brain fog_ anxiety_ depression_ back pain_chest pain.,Check out this relationship between Protonix & Nexium_ both in similar drug families. In 1998 I was diagnosed with Duodenal ulcer caused by H.Pylori. Ulcer was cured but 1 year later developed GERD as a result of mild hiatal hernia. Dr. precribed Protonix for 2 weeks_it worked but_ heartburn kept returning. went on Protonix full time. after 3 years started having chest pain_ anxiety_dizziness. Assumed it was stress and changed jobs and eating habits. I stopped the Protonix for 2 years and symptoms went away. In 2006 GERD pain returned_ I had Endoscopy_ and Colonoscopy. Endo showed mild irritaion as a result of previous H.Pylori complicated by hiatal hernia. Started back on protonix but did not help. In 2007 started Nexium. worked great for a year then started having all the bad symptoms described above. When I tried to refill my prescription a note from the pharmacy said my Dr. wanted me to make a appointment.Dr. said thatnew reasearch showed that Nexium can complicate heart disease treatments as they relate to lowering cholestol and aspirin therapy and that it could increase the platlet levels in the blood. We decide to try something different in my research I found this site. What a relevation_ I had no idea this was the cause of my problems.I am off Nexium for 3 days now and just this knowlege alone has made me feel better. I'll keep posting my progress.

477, 3, nausea_ gerd_ suspected ulcers,extreme dizziness_ head fog_ blurred vision_ severe muscle fatigue and bone ache_ depression_ occasional severe gas pains_ anxiety_ diarrhea_ occasional itching mainly on throat_,I ignored the reviews that I had read about Nexium and decided to try it as my stomach pain had become unbearable. My partner has also had great results with Nexium (besides weight gain and headaches_ and recently hives). I wasn't too bad for the first four days and but soon severe dizziness and blurred vision set in. I haven't left the house in a week and didn't realise that it was the meds until I came across this review site. The amount of muscle fatigue and bone pain was incredible. I took strong pain killers all day once and it didn't relieve the discomfort. I have also been depressed which I hope will go away now that I have stopped taking this drug. I'm quite upset that I have suffered such severe side effects as it DID work for me - my stomach pain (sometimes reached a 9/10) has disappeared_ I have had minimal reflux and my nausea went as of the second day of taking the pill. Although the side effects are severe with me_ it was still a hard decision to come off Nexium as I was in so much pain beforehand. I'm going overseas this week though and can't risk passing out in a foreign country so it's back to otc meds for me until my return. It's also too hard dealing with the amount of fatigue and bone pain when I have two small children to look after - I haven't been able to get off the sofa in a week.Nexium did work spectacularly for my immense stomach pain and nausea and I'd maybe put up with the horrid effects if I had a high chance of recovery within 3 months.,F,26,8  days,8/2/2009Email,Nexium

Wow_ after reading the comments_ I could have written many of these myself!!!  I am going to stop the Nexium to see if any of my symptoms improve.  My doctors know I have throat and dry mouth issues and osteo so why would they give me a medication that could possibly aggravate my symptoms???  I had started on Protonox but Ins refused to pay so was switched to Nexium_ which I'v taken on and off for the past two years  or so. GI doc just reduced it to once a day instead of twice a day.  Nothing ventured_ nothing gained. I am going to stop the Nexium and see if I notice an improvement and_ if so_ how long it takes. Doc has also added low dose Amytriptaline_ which can cause dry mouth and throat. Maybe it is the Nexium that is causing my queezy stomach.,F,59,2  years,7/31/2009Email,Nexium

I feel as if I'm going crazy_ am very depressed.",I was taking Prevacid for about 11 years but recently developed bad symptoms. An EKG and full blood workup were not connected to any illness. My PCP switched me  to Nexium_ 40mg in am. I took it for 5 days: the first 3 days I felt okay but day 4 and 5 were dreadful; I feel and fear as if I'm suffering from a terminal disease. On day 5_ I saw a gastroenterologist who scheduled me for an endoscopy in 3 weeks_ said there isn't much difference between Prevacid & Nexium--nor did he think my symptoms were side effects of either. It is possible that some of my symptoms are from long-term use of Prevacid_ but when I stopped it_ I did feel better. Then came Nexium! I think I'm losing my mind and wonder if anyone has had similar symptoms or an experience like mine. I took Pepcid Complete (OTC) today_ but fear acid reflux and heartburn will get very bad without a ppi. I'm taking Ativan for the extreme anxiety (which only partially helps) and Rolaids throughout the day.

502, 1, gerd; chronic heartburn,After six and a half years_ have tenderness and pain in the stomach area_ still have some reflux problems_ mild intermittent nausea_ occasional vomiting_ insomnia and weight gain. Recent upper GI scoping found dozens of polyps caused by the Nexium according to my gastroenterologist.  They were biopsied and were benign (thank God). He doubled my dose a few weeks before the scoping to 80 mgs a day_ and my dry mouth and dry eyes got so much worse_ I couldn't sleep.  My digestion also slowed down so I had to stop eating for a day or two.  I stopped the double dose after 4 days.,When I first started Nexium it was like a miracle. I was taking 40 mg a day_ and after three days_ was without symptoms.  My life became normal after years of hearburn_ reflux_ gastritis_ etc. The upper GI I had done shortly after starting Nexium revealed one gastric polyp.  Recently_ after another scoping_ I had so many polyps the doc could only remove 12 for biopsy. Over 6 and a half years_ I developed dry mouth and dry eyes that greatly interfered with my quality of life and work (I had to read a lot at work). I have been weaning myself from Nexium (primarily due to the polyps) for the last week (with otc prilosec 20 mg.) Last night I took nothing and had the best night's sleep I've had in years.  The dryness was not as bad_ and now I wonder if that was from the Nexium all along_ and not from an autoimmune disease (docs not sure).  The docs never seem to relate any symptoms to the drugs you are taking.  You would think it would be the first thing they would rule out. I have changed my diet and follow the rules (no food 3 hours before bed) and hope to be off Nexium forever.  It did_ however_ get me through a difficult time when those aspects of my life were not under control (I also had little knowledge) of triggers_ etc.  I have also lost weight which helps with the hiatal hernia.,F,54,6  years,6/2/2009Email,Nexium

I was originally prescribed Zantac_ which proved partially effective; the same stands for both the Pariet and Nexium I have been prescribed; they seem to reduce the frequency of my heartburn a bit_ but it is still just as painful whilst I am engaged in the year-long wait for stomach surgery. The prospect of facing another year with heartburn that is not controlled by Nexium- the only medication I take for this condition-is distressing(and painful).,F,25,7  months,5/16/2009,Nexium

515, 2, Barrett's/Acid Reflux,Abdominal pain_ bloating_ dizziness_ dry mouth.,I am a healthy 62. Nine years ago_ an endoscopy revealed a miniscule amount of Barrett's_ and my GI doc and GP both insisted I take a pump inhibitor. Aciphex doubled me over in pain and Nexium was advised. I was told I would need to take it the rest of my life to prevent the Barrett's from getting any worse. The thought of esophageal cancer was enough motivation to take the drug. The second endoscopy_ three years later_ showed no change in the Barrett's. Another three years has passed_ and I'm due for a third. In the meantime_ I believe the Nexium is making me miserable. All my docs insist that not taking it will increase the potential of getting something awful. They also insist that symptoms reported in this group_ and the symptoms I've reported to them_ just don't make sense. To make matters more confusing_ a recent barium swallow test revealed that I don't have acid reflux.   I'm really confused. Thank you for listening_ and thank you all for this group.,M,62, ,5/6/2009Email,Nexium
516, 5, Acid Reflux and start of an ulcer,Absolutely NO side effects_ I've been feeling fantastic ever since I started this medication.,I believe a lot of people are very sensitive to medication. I also think a lot of of people have phobias or fears about medications and let these fears run away with them. Worrying about taking a new medication in it's self can cause most of the anxiety and other symptoms that have been described by most people here. I should know I have created more anxiety with new medicines than the original illness I was treated for. Trust your doctors! They wouldn't give you a medicine that would intentionally harm you. It takes more than a few days to see the full results of your medication. The cramps could just be the excess acid your stomach was building in the first place being cleaned out of your system. Give it time to do what it is intended to do. I've taken this medication for 15 years or more and have had no side effects. In fact I feel fantastic. But I do remember in the beginning not feeling so great. I stuck with it and about 30 days later I felt everything balancing out and feeling great. Again_ the cramps_ diarrhea may just be the excess acid cleaning out of your system.,F,46,15  years,5/5/2009Email,Nexium

It was so persistent_ I thought it was heart related and went to the emergency room in the middle of the night.  I've been through a barrage of stress tests_ blood tests of every description_ MRI's_ CT scans and extensive physical.  Every test was negative.  My doc is at a loss to explain and wants to refer me to a host of additional specialists (rheumatology_ neurology_ physiatrist_ etc.).  I'm really sick of all of the costly and apparently unneccessary medical testing.  There is a direct correlation between the time I started taking this drug and the onset of these side effects.  I asked my doctor if there could be any correlation between long term use of Nexium and the on-going symptoms I'm having.  He stated not likely.  I'm sick of the inability to get to the root of these symptoms and just began my own research and found this site.  After reading the many other's comments_ I have to believe there is a greater risk to use of this medication than is commonly known.  I'm going to look for other alternatives immediately and get off this stuff for good.,M,49,3  years,5/4/2009,Nexium

520, 1, stomach cramps / heartburn,foggy & heavy headed / dizziness / headaches / blurred vision / loss of weight (5kg in 10 days) / anxiety / numbness on left side of arm and fingers / constant feeling of 'sick' and unable to focus,Briefly_ Nexium will probably work to alleviate your symptoms of heartburn / cramps / acid reflux. However_ the amount of side effects are numerous and dangerous. I am healthy_ active_ and not overweight_ however_ was prescribed nexium for 2 weeks for cramps and heartburn.  I took it 11 days and felt misrable with the side effects_ and this left me thinking i had a serious illness_ such as cancer or a tumor. So i stopped taking nexium and the next day_ most of my symptoms stopped_ the 2nd day_ i was back to normal.  Please note that nexium is a relatively new medicine-thorough and complete testing has not been conducted and it's long term affects are still not known. (they possibly could be using us as guinea pigs?!) Anyways_ i urge all to reconsider using this medication by discussing with your doctor alternative medicines; the side effects that occur are not justified for it's use as an anatiacid. (Also_ do not let your doctor convince you that nexium has no effects - if you thought that_ you wouldn't have reached this site.) You are the best one to know your body - and most likely the doctors have not personnaly taken nexium to discover its effects.  WISHING ALL GOOD HEALTH.,F,34,11  days,4/25/2009Email,Nexium
521, 1, Stomach cramps / heartburn,foggy-headed_ continuous dull headaches_ dizziness_ blurred vision_feeling worn out and tired_ some stomach pains_ anxiety_ significant weight loss (5kg in 10 days),To be brief_ nexium probably helps the stomach pain/acid. However_ the side effects are extreme and troublesome. If your illness is severe or complicated_ maybe you should use nexium (or if you can find an similar alternative medicine - BETTER)- then the side effects can maybe be accepted.  But if you are sufferieng from a minor problem_ i certainly would not recommend taking this drug - it's not worth the side effects. Since this is a relatively new drug_ not enough research has been conducted_ nor is there evidence of it's long term effects. Try all possible measures to avoid this medication.  I was prescribed nexium for 1 month at first; after the side effects began_ i thought i had something serious - tumor_ cancer_ etc.  So i stopped after i couldn't bear it.  I was immediately better the next day (and so was my stomach cramps).  Don't let nexium ruin your life.  Please spread the word - to help others.,F,34,11  days,4/25/2009Email,Nexium

I took the meds the next day and had severe abdominal cramping and bloating again.  This morning I feel alright still no reflux. So_ the meds appear to do the job on reflux but I am not sure it is worth the severe abdominal pain I have for several hours after I take it.

Over the years I have suffered from Rosacia_ heart palpitations_ sever sinusitis_ anxiety and depression. I never had a problem with any of these things until just the past 6 to 8 years. I never associated these problems with the Nexium though until coming to this website. I also read somewhere that Nexium can cause Rosacia. I don't know what I will do if I stop taking the Nexium because if i miss one pill I will get heartburn. But after reading this_ I won't be taking it anymore.

I strongly suggest finding an alterior method of acid control. this drug has not been tested on long term effects.

I started with 20mg and after the 1st month went to 40mg_ daily.  I have had no chest pains since I started the Nexium and my tests have all been fine.  So last week My GI said to stop the Nexium and to try and control my GERD with diet.  Ever since I stopped_ I have been dizzy and can not stop the feeling of throwing up.

My doctor keeps telling me it is just the anxiety and has prescribed xanax for me which I am reluctant to take as it can become habit forming. We have not even discussed the possibility of all of the symptoms I have being side effects. I just don't think it is by accident that my anxiety has jumped ten fold and all of these other symptoms have shown up since I started taking Nexium.

Waited four days and Started back for one dose and within 24 hours side effects  returned with force. I read people with Penicillin allergy should not take this and I do have that so maybe a connection. I know I felt better before the medication than after it.

574, 1, Acid Reflux & misc. stomach issues,ANXIETY,I am SOOOO glad I found this site!  I was prescribed Nexium to help with some stomach/acid issues I'd been having.  Not only did it not help me_ it made me feel like a head case!  Doing routine_ pleasurable_ and fun things started making me anxious.  Long car rides_ pedicures_ church...all made me SO anxious.  My heart would race_ I'd feel nauseous and shake_ and I felt hot...I just wanted to get out or get away.  It was the most awful feeling.  Usually lasted about 30-40 minutes.  Until taking Nexium_ I've never experienced such a thing.  I realized that it was probably the Nexium_ since I would feel fine in the morning_ take it in the afternoon_ and feel like crap in the hours after taking it.  And as I mentioned earlier_ I've never experienced anxiety like that in my life until I started the Nexium.  I have stopped taking the Nexium_ and have not had the anxiety since.

The doctors thought that it was my gallbladder.  Wrong the gall bladder is fine. I forgot to take my Nexium for one day and guess what the stomach pain was not near as bad.  I told the dr and he said it was a coincidence that Nexium wouldnt cause pain.  I decided after all the tests were run and nothing was wrong that I would stop the Nexium for a while.  Within 2 days I was pain free and could eat again.  DO NOT TAKE NEXIUM no matter what they tell you.  This drug has to many harmful effects that the public isnt aware of.

I plan to visit my ear_nose_ throat doctor for another answer to the gerd.  Just a note to those suffering acid/reflux:  We are the only country suffering greatly with gerd because  we have such a diet of rich and spicey foods.  Research the web for foods that become alkaline in your stomach.  Our stomach ph is alkaline. Remember to avoid large quantities of acid producing foods and eat more of the alkaline. This will not solve the damage done to our esophagus_ nor the damage done by the use of nexium_ but it will lower the chances of an upset stomach and acid reflux.,F,62,3  years,11/11/2008,Nexium

In the 9th week taking Nexium I awakened with severe neck and shoulder pain which sent me to the hospital. A vascular study was done which was normal except it was noted that my thyroid gland on the same side as the pain was blood filled. No report yet on this. Stopped taking Nexium and all symptoms disappeared.,I have taken Prilosec_ Preacid and Nexium for Gerd and all have side effects that are dangerous. I would recommend that if a person can_ try something else for your Gerd. I believe that drug manufacturers are more interested in profit than cures and therefore don't test their drugs long enough to rule out possible dangerous side effects.

Never had a problem and never had a pain once I stopped taking it. This summer I had to take iron pills and the pain came back. I took Protonix for 5 days but I had side effects of diarrhea and headaches. So I ask the doctor to put me on the Nexium. I was told to take 40mg every other day. Stomach pain was not gone. So I took it daily for about two weeks and was able to try it every other day. I started having diarrhea_and pain intermittently. For the last week I've been taking one 40mg pill in the morning everyday and have not had any problems. No diarrhea either. So far so good.,F,46,30  days,11/5/2008,Nexium

At the same time tingling in the arms and hands_ mild chest pressure_ dizziness_ and fatigue set in.  This started happening daily.  Two ER visits led physicians to look for heart attack or stroke.  My MD had an MRI ordered and they found nothing.  No definitive diagnosis was forthcoming.  A couple of experiences had feelings of a strong electrical shock inside my head on the right hemisphere which lasted a couple of seconds.  I stopped the Nexium and saw immediate improvements.

I've been taking some type of proton pump inhibitor since I was 17.  I think the main thing to remember is this drug will change things in your body_ it blocks the production of stomach acid.  That being said_ some changes should be expected early on in the treatment_ in my opinion.  It is a drug to help with a specific condition.  Surely in some cases people will not be able to handle it- I had a friend who stopped taking it because he couldn't handle the change in digestion.  But in the long run for me it is worth it if I don't end up with Barrett's. For me it was like starting any other medication_ my body just had to get used to it.

I've noticed that if I don't take the Nexium_ within 24 hours I don't have the gas bubble_ constipation or the joint swelling_ I'll have to see if the insomnia goes away once I stop taking Nexium completely. My knuckles are so swollen that I can't even get a ring on my right hand ring finger_ it's crazy_ but within one day of not taking Nexium_ I can get a ring on that finger again.,My doctor never mentioned these side effects when they put me on this medicine.

In addition_ my hair (head and body) were thinning at an alarming rate.,I stopped taking the drug about 5 months ago and my hair just started growing back in. Rebound burning in stomach_ depression and insomnia stopped after less than a week_ fortunately. Still have dry eyes_ nose and mouth_ however.,F,55,9  months,4/14/2008,Nexium
699, 1, GERD/acid reflux,Some relief from acid reflux symptoms_ but had diarrhea almost on a daily basis_ daily stomach pain which kept me feeling like I needed to eat all the time_ and worst of all--decreased bone density (discovered later_ due to incomplete absorption of minerals)_ condition known as osteopenia (precursor to osteoporosis).,Am now 61_ but started this drug around age 52. Had suffered with GERD for at least 20 years_ but symptoms got worse with age and increasing weight. Went off Nexium_ then to Prevacid_ and later to Prilosec_ hoping to get fewer side effects_ but not successful at this at all. All together_ was on proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs for about 7 years. Gallbladder removed at age 44. Diagnosed with rare-type pancreas tumor in 2005 and had surgery in Dec. 2005. Went off all PPI drugs in early 2006. Real reasons for GERD: eating too much sugar and wheat (and other gluten grains) for many years_ and not enough bile acids for proper digestion. MY CURE: taking bile acid salts and full-strength pancreatic enzymes supplements with every meal. Drastically changed my diet to high-fat_ moderate-protein_ low-carb (NO wheat or other gluten grains) with absolutely no processed food; added raw dairy and grassfed_ pastured_ locally-grown beef_ poultry_ and pork_ organic produce. I have normal digestion now,F,61,1  years,4/13/2008Email,Nexium
700, 1, Chronic acid reflux/suspected ulcer,Terrible skin rash_ anxiety_ depression_ flu like symptoms_ insomnia,Took anti-inflamatory drugs for 12 months whilst waiting for a hip replacement operation.  Experienced burning in stomach immediately after op.  Put on Nexium 40mg 6 months ago.  Appeared to help_ but over the past month the side effects have become unbearable.  I suddenly wondered whether the Nexium itself was the cause of the problem - awful skin irritation and rash_ depression_ a real struggle to get up and go to work_ awful insomnia and almost manic thoughts at time (never experienced before in my life).  So_ went into your website - unbelievable - all the things that I was suffering from were reported by so many other people.  Have taken my last Nexium tablet for ever.  Will now control the symptoms of acid reflux with a bland diet and hope that_ before long_ I will start to feel like a normal_ sane person again once the drug is out of my system.,F,62,6  months,4/9/2008,Nexium

702, 1, acid indigestion,Abdominal pain_ dizziness_ nausea_ sharp pain on the bottom of my feet,I stopped taking Nexium after only 11 days when I realized my side effects were from the drug.  It's been almost 4 months since I've taken Nexium and I am still experiencing abdominal pain_ dizziness and nausea that comes and goes.  Can anybody please tell me how long these symptoms are going to last?,F,42,11  days,4/8/2008,Nexium
703, 5, Acid Reflux,I am a singer who was always hoarse for years until I began taking Nexium.  Almost right away there was clarity in my voice.  Haing had vocal cord surgery_ I now take Nexium religiously without any side effects.  I have been told to keep watch on bone health though as it can take away from your calcium absorption leaving women espe cially prone to osteoporosis.  After several years of taking it I just had a bone scan for the disease and showed no problems.  Be proactive and take your medication but also find out as much as you can about it and get tested as advised regularly.,,,49,7  years,4/3/2008,Nexium
704, 1, Stomach pains,I am STILL suffering from the WORST headaches I have ever encountered. I have also had a steady fever (101 deg)_ shakes and chills_ goosebumps_ light-headedness_ and joint pains.,"My FORMER Doctor had prescribed this to me after Prilosec was not working. He had never mentioned ANYTHING about side-effects and said that ""because I didn't have any side-effects from Prilosec_ I PROBABLY wouldn't have any side-effects from this either."" After I asked him the difference between the two products_ he told me that there were ""some biological differences""...NEVER EVER_ EVER_ EVER_ take this pill. I stopped taking it this morning (which would've been day 10)_ after this 4 day fever. Also_ I started noticing fever like symptoms after the night of my 6th day.

705, 1, GERD,I have been suffering from chest and a horrible burning abdominal pain-not related to what and when I ate. depression_ anxiety_ aches and pains_ tired all of the time. Have had endoscopy_ CT Scan_ upper GI_ ultrasound_ ekg/echo stress test.....all normal.  Dr tried different pain meds...none worked.   I ran out of my nexium and figured it didn't seem to make me feel better_ so why take it.  Now I am making the connection with all of my symptoms to the nexium!  I already feel better_ off for about 5 days.  will never take again!,I think next time a Dr gives me a new drug_ I will do my research on all of the side effects first.  I thought I was going to die_ my abdominal pain was unbearable.  It was constant epigastric burning pain(like a deep hunger pain)that would not go away with eating-hense the waight gain.  I would recommend people to be aware of the side effects of any medicine! I also tried protonix_ had insomnia for a year! a friend helped me make the connection.,F,43,1  years,3/29/2008,Nexium

Have had severe reflux for 10 years mostly at night. Nexium did help that but side effects which I thought were coming from fibromyalgia were actually from medication.,Have stopped medication on doctors orders.Got previcid samples. He said in 10 days I would feel like a miracle has happened. I truly hope he is right. As it has been 15 months of hell. Have taken previcid _aciphex had to change due to insurance carrier no longer paid for it.

707, 3, Acid Reflux,I started taking 40mg in the am about 2 weeks ago. I immediately began getting hunger pains all the time but wasn't interested in food once served. Then came headaches_ severe tingling pain in my hands at night and most recently a rash that has caused me to be incapacitated for the past 4 days! It started Thursday 3/20 on the soles of my feet. By Friday night I was in bed almost delerious with pain and swelling in every joint/muscle in my body. I didn't make the connection and thought I better stay in bed to be ready to cook easter dinner - didn't take the Nexium Sat or Sun but the rash has moved to my face and wrists and I was not only unable to cook easter dinner for my family but they left late Sunday for a ski trip and I am stuck home in pain. Finally called my MD and have an app tomorrow but the RN said she doubts it's the Nexium - BS - I stopped taking Sat and the symptoms are SLOWLY decreasing. The flu like symp with this painful rash are enough to make you want to die - or mayb,"I wouldn't ever put this in my body again! I can live and will do so happily with the occasional bout with GER before sending my system into near anaphalactic shock by swollowing this ""little purple pill"" or should I say POISON PILL! I am 37 and have no other health issues I am beyond angry to think I missed my son's first trip snowboarding (something I was going to teach because dad ski's) due to this virelle substance - I will never get this time back but some pharma rep is golfing in Scottsdale for his exceeding his qoata all paid by the makers of NEXIUM!",F,37,16  days,3/24/2008Email,Nexium
708, 1, GERD,Sharp right shoulder pain_ debilitating pain on the right side of chest_ shortness of breath,The chest pain was so severe that my P.A. suspected a small pneumothorax (free air in chest that pushes on the lung).  I was out of breath walking from one end of my house to the other.  When I thought about when the symptoms started_ I could trace it back to a day or two after I started the Nexium.  After discontinuing the Nexium_ symptoms started to resolve within 24-48 hours.  Three weeks later_ all but the shoulder pain is completely resolved and that is substantially better.,F,31,22  days,3/24/2008,Nexium

Two of those I had no symptoms except depression and muscle inflamation then 2 years in I got 2 abnormal ekgs and trouble with breathlessness after stairs oddly the feeling would get better after a gas bubble would disperse in my upper stomach. Then one day my world changed. I suddenly got terrible bloating after everything  I ate. I couldn't rid the pressure. Headaches_ Breathlessness_ indigestion ensued. I changed my diet to no avail and lost 25 lbs. in 4 months. Went off Nexium 2 weeks ago and bloating completely subsided. I have Barretts (just diagnosed) and need acid blocker but these PPIs are scary. I wish they'd research long term usage more because Drs are certainly putting people on them years.

745, 3, GERD,"I have been a GERD sufferer since the early 1980's. I have taken Nexium for about the last 3 or 4 years_ and it worked well until recently with no side effects.  However_ in Nov. 2007_ I began having burning in my stomach early in the morning just before morning_ totally different from GERD.  I thought I had an ulcer_ and so did my gastroenterologist.  After upper endoscopy this week_ the doctor found no evidence of an ulcer_ but my stomach was redder than normal and he found some ""benign polyps"" which he said were common with people who take PPIs such as Nexium.  He said my problem was probably ""anxiety"" because polyps ""don't generally cause any pain.""  Mmmm_ I began to suspect a rat.  In researching side effects of Nexium_ I discovered that some people have stomach problems as side effects.  I didn't take a dose yesterday or today (substituted famotidine to control GERD) and BINGO - my stomach burning went away.  Hopefully_ I will be able to get off PPI'","I would advise caution in taking any PPI long term.  I am concerned about the ""benign polyps"" (am still awaiting the biopsy)_ but I have learned that they do_ in some instances_ go away after discontinuing the PPI.

A great disappointment is the fact that my physician is basically a pharmaceutical shill as opposed to objectively considering that the Nexium may have been the cause of my health issues.  It outrages me because I spent time going to specialists (rheumatalogist_ opthalmalogist) to determine what what causing my pain/eye problems. The Nexium helped somewhat with my stomach issue_ but the cost I paid wasn't worth it.  I would have fared better with an OTC drug.  Much gratitude to those who shared their experiences with Nexium and helped me to decide to stop using it immediately.,F,55,5  years,9/14/2007,Nexium

The bloat and pain is gone. usually in the mornings I can barely walk to the bathroom from the foot pain and now I'm walking every morning for an hour. I haven't had any dizziness either. I have been sleeping better without back pain. I'm sure with time I will feel so much better. I can't believe I have spent so may yrs crippled from this drug.

When I started_ my bowel movements stopped for several days and gas increased substantially through both ends.  The headaches increased in intensity over several days.  Had to stop taking Nexium after 4-7 days.  Tried taking Nexium 4 times over a 6 month period.  I was finally told by my doctor that headaches and leg pain are known side effects.

Yes_ it is true that syptom relief made me able to eat without fear of pain_ but I tracked my calories and measured and weighed my food_ and there is no way the weight gain could be attributed to overeating or increased appetite.

I do not drink any alcohol!  I still limit any food intake 3 hours before bedtime and try to sleep on my left side.  Nexium has given me the greatest relief as compared to all OTC H2 and OTC PPI's.  I'm on week 5 of an 8 week treatment.,Great medicine.  I only hope that I don't become dependant on it.  But as my esphogus heals then maybe I'll be able to take an OTC PPI if my symtoms re-occur and I catch them ASAP!Can't wait for a generic.

Nexium works by shutting everything down a little bit in the digestive system_ naturally shutting down acid production and getting so-called ""relief."" When u don't digest your food all the way_ other health problems begin to occur eventually leading to stomach cancer and/or other serious conditions. This is not as uncommon as u may like to think it would be. All u need to do is take digestive enzymes with all your meals_ a teasp. to a tblsp. (or a tablet) of apple cider-vinegar after every meal_ and ""Heartburn Free"" orange peel extract every other day. After a month u should be completely healed of acid refux_ even if your doctor told u that u need Nexium or something like it for the rest of your life.",M,18,2  months,6/8/2007,Nexium

853, 4, Reflux,Was unaware of any negative side efects until I was diagnosed with enemia.  Then discovered B12 (sublingual) bosted my energy.  Long tern use kills ability to asorb B12.

854, 1, haital hernia/GERD,Pain in every joint in my body_ nausea_ vomitting_ diarrhea.,I was taking Nexium to help reduce chest pain my Dr. thought was brought on by GERD. The joint paid showed up the second week of taking one pill a day and the chest pain was still present.  My Dr. told me to start taking 2 pills a day_ which I did for just over one day when I got the worst flu symptoms I have ever known_ with sweats_ chills_ vomitting_ and diarrhea.  I stopped taking all meds for several days until I felt better. I have not taken Nexium since_ but did try taking a related drug_ Prilosec. I got joint pain on the 4th day and stopped taking it on the 5th day. The joint pain cleared in 2 days.,F,49,14  days,5/29/2007,Nexium

856, 3, for reflux symptoms,Experienced stomach pain and bloating_ loss of appetite_ nausea.  Occasionally some blurred vision and also discomfort with contact lens use so maybe it is drying my eyes out a bit.,It definitely worked to help relieve my symptoms of reflux.  This nagging lump feeling in my throat is pretty much gone as well as the chest pain so this makes it really difficult to decide whether or not to continue taking it and just learn to tolerate the side effects.,F,35,2  weeks,5/26/2007Email,Nexium
857, 5, GERT,None that I can tell thus far (have been taking 40mg a day for 6 months) Possibly blurred vision_ but who's to tell I stare at a computer screen all day.,My pain was so bad i didn't want to eat_ and seemingly could not find anything that didnt cause the stomatch/esophogal pains. The pain was so bad I began to think i have back problems_ mind you I am not overweight like most people_ I am in geed health_ work out_ the whole nine yards... I started taking the 40mg tabs 1 a day and have not felt a pain since (unless i forget to take it... and you know it works well when you actually can forget to take it because you feel nothing).,M,24,6  months,5/21/2007,Nexium
858, 1, GERD,Took 12 doses of Nexium. At dose 10 the abdominal pain was starting to get bad_ short little stabs of pain that felt like broken glass sloshing around in my guts. Basically shut down my ability to digest food. Stopped the drug. Now_ 11 days later_ it appears the problems have resolved and I can once again digest food.,For me_ Nexium was an effective diet pill--I lost weight (unintentionally). If you have a bad reaction to Nexium and have abdominal pain_ don't expect your problems to resolve as soon as you stop. It took a week and a half for me to heal from the damage caused by a dozen doses of Nexium.,M,44,12  days,5/20/2007,Nexium

863, 1, stomach upset,I took Nexium for 10 days. Slowly developed abdominal cramps_ occasional short-lived piercing pain under my rib cage_ slight itching under arms and around pant line and a feeling of fullness like I needed to burp but couldnt.  Suddenly_ day 10_ I break out in horrible itching hives and severe off/on chest/stomach pain_ dizziness_ lightheadedness_ nausea_ faint_ swollen right hand and right foot.  I thought I was having heart attack so went to emergency room but didn't check in cause started feeling better.  Next day more hives_ more itching_ swelling moved to lips/eyelids.  Got steroid injection and took antihistamines_ neither helped the itching nor did ANY topical solution help the itching.  Finally suspected the Nexium and stopped taking the 2nd day of worsening hives and got another steroid injection with prednisone pill treatment.  I was scared to death my airway was going to swell shut.  Finally day 3 with no Nexium in the morning and 2 steriod regimens_ my itching finally,This is a horrible product with a very sinister possiblity for a life threatening reaction that swells your throat shut.  I can't even say it helped my stomach problems cause it seemed to create more cramps_ abdomin pain_ and digestion problems.  And I wonder how you're supposed to extract nutrients from food with no stomach acid.,M,41,10  days,5/15/2007Email,Nexium
864, 1, GERD,"After approx. 2 weeks of Nexium I developed a ""shards in the stomach"" feeling of pain in the upper abdomen_ plus belching_ diarrhea.

Now I'm waiting for the Nexium-induced symptoms to clear up_ appears it will be several days.",,M,45,14  days,5/12/2007,Nexium
865, 5, bad stomach_ diahhrea,To be honest_ none. I was very surprised and pleased.,I no longer take Nexium after reading up on the long-term effects_ such as decreased absorption of certain vitamins/nutrients/minerals_ i.e. calcium. I went off the drug about 3-4 months ago and_ knock on wood_ my old stomach issues have not returned. I'm not sure if that means the Nexium effects last a lot longer than just the daily pill_ or what. But so far I'm off the nexium and feeling fine.,M,35,2  years,5/10/2007,Nexium
866, 5, Stomach Ulcers,I have not had any side effects taking Nexium and have been on it for over a year.,After having stomach ulcers for years and being on other medications_ Nexium is the only pill that works for me. I can't miss one dose of this medication or my stomach ulcers will flare-up to the point that I am extremely sick.  People must realize that medications work differently for everyone.

868, 1, doctor told me to,I do my best to let everyone know that there are many drugs that need to be avoided if one has Hepatitis C. Nexium is one of them.  I have had hundreds of phone calls and emails from my clients who are successfully lowering their viral load and all of a sudden it is up millions of points.  Many of them have one thing in common. They took Nexium_ the purple pill you see advertised on TV for acid reflux disease.  This time it was Carolyn W.  In October 2006 her viral load was 143.000  Carolyn's doctor gave her a bag with 4 sample bottles of Nexium_ 7 pills per bottle_ 40 mg per pill.  She took all 28 pills.  She retested in December of 2006 less than two months later and her viral load was over 5.000.000 (FIVE MILLION).   I have seen this well over a thousand times where only Nexium was taken.  I also see this with Amoxicillin_ Flu Shot_ Hepatitis A & B vaccine_ Viagra_ Prozac_ Zoloft_ Paxil_ Celexa_ Serzone_ Lexpro_ Effexorxir_ Wellbutrin S/R and many other prescription drugs.,Your doctor will not know this_ will not believe it...

914, 3, Acid reflux,Ostioporosis leg fracture.,I am 54 years old and have ostioporosis. I have been on prilosec and then nexium for the last 15 years due to acid reflux. A recent medical study confirmed my suspicion that these acid reducing drugs can cause ostioporosis. To obsorb calcium and the other hard minerals necessary for bone health you need a sufficent quantity of stomach acid. These drugs can reduce your stomach acid to the point where you may not be able to obsorb the required amount of calcium to mantain healthy bones. Unfortunately this is a major side effect if you use these drugs on a long term basis. If you have been on these drugs long term_ you may want to have a bone density scan to determine where you are at. I found out the hard way. I now have a fracture that does not want to heal.,M,54,15  years,12/30/2006Email,Nexium

Starting in the third week and continuing on until I stopped the drug were the more severe side effects that I listed.  Worst was such a tightness in my chest and throat that it felt like 200 pounds were sitting on my chest while someone was trying to strangle me.  Felt like my throat was going to close up.  This would happen about every third day with one day being ""normal"" and the second day feeling the full blown chest pressure coming on.  Doctor told me I was bringing it on with stress.  I didn't buy that although I was getting more stressed all the time with this day long pressure on my chest.

I'd say it didn't work well enough for me to say on it.,I had much better results on 30 mg of prevacid twice daily. I took prevacid for two years with no side effects.

928, 2, I was diagnosed with GERD,After about 4 weeks on the Nexium_ I broke out in a rash covering my chest_ abdomen_ back and arms.  Initially the doctor said if I was going to have an allergic reaction_ it would have happened right away.  However_ after taking a round of antihistamine_ I consulted with a dermatologist who said it was definiately something internal_ and the only change in diet or medication was the Nexium.  I have been off the Nexium for 3 days and the rash has not subsided - so the jury is still out on the cause.  I also am proned to panic attacks_ and found them recurring during the month I was on the Nexium.  I also experienced severe stomach pain_ which I did not have before taking the medication.  The only symptom I had that took me to see a doctor was difficulty swallowing due to a swollen Larnyx.,If I determine the rash is not from the Nexium_ I might be persuaded to try again.,F,57,30  days,10/26/2006,Nexium

After 4 days_ could hardly walk or sleep from the muscle pain. Would not recommend this drug to anyone that is sensitive to Proton Pump Inhibitors as I had similar reaction to Prevacid.

935, 3, Heartburn,The medicine got rid of my heartburn_ but I got off of it after about a year because of the side effects.  It was hard to notice this for a long time but the medicine made me very anxious a lot of the time_ I would become over worried about things and would experience a fair amount of panic attacks.  I even tried to get on some anti-depressants to calm me down.  Finally I stopped taking nexium just for the heck of it and after a couple of weeks I felt great.  No more anxiety.,As long as I stay away from soft drinks and lots of greasy foods I don't have heartburn.  It almost seems better to not eat such bad foods for fear of heartburn_ gives me a reason to eat healthier.  Just be sure to look out for depression or anxiety while taking this.

Before my heartburn & acid reflux was so bad that I've actually went to the ER one night_because I thought I was having a heart attack which it wasn't just Chronic Heartburn & Acid Reflux from a small portion of bad eating habits and years of not realizing I was abusing over the counter drugs. It was so bad that my food would stuck from the damage to my esophagus. I swear within 2 days of taking Nexium I could tell 100% difference and within a couple of weeks I forgot I had any kind of heartburn or acid reflux at all.
