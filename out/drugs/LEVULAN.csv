0, 2, moderate hormonal acne,redness_ burning_ itching_ peeling_ pigmentation,Had one treatment of levulan with Blue-U. Cost approx. $400. I looked moderately sunburned for 3 days - people asked what happened to me - it didn't look like I had been on vacation... Had to stay inside for 2 days after treatment because of photosensitivity. Then the peeling starts - didn't notice much more peeling than with tazorac treatment. You don't look normal for about 1 week. After 1 week - broke out with hormonal acne on schedule_ but now my old acne spots are even darker than before. And the skin on my face is now darker than my neck. Difficult to camouflage with makeup. I have light brown skin - maybe not the best candidate for this treatment_ although the nurse said she has not seen this type of pigmentation reaction before...It does seem to make your skin smooth after the peeling_ but I am not happy with the darker acne spots - this is the reason I got the levulan Blue-u in the first place_ so I am very disappointed to say the least...,F,44,1  times,4/3/2007,Levulan
