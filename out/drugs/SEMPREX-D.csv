0, 5, seasonal allergies/ hayfever,No known side effects to date,Very fast acting and has been great over the past five years. Becoming more and more expensive due to its availability in the U.S. The capsule is very small and easily swallowed. Through trial and error and after my Dr. tried everything_ Semprex-D worked. No more miserable sneeze attacks or runny nose. Doesn't dry your sinuses out and just works well.,M,36,5  years8mg 1X D,9/7/2011,Semprex-d
1, 5, ,I have tried all antihistamines and this is the best. There are no side effects I noticed... it sucks it took me forever to find this. Drug companies heavily promote allegra et al. Had to order it from UK.,,M,21,2  days,12/27/2007,Semprex-d
2, 5, Hay Fever,None. Works perfectly!,Acrivastine (the active ingredient in Semprex-D) is also sold in the UK as 'Benadryl' and used as a hay fever remedy. I've found it extremely effective and side-effect free. Other antihistamines (especially loratadine) I find very hard to tolerate. Highly recommended.,M,37,4  years,6/4/2007,Semprex-d
3, 4, sinus congestion_ fluid in ear,This medicine did not cause any side effects during the day except for a dry mouth and slight buzz. But I think the acrivastine in this preparation kept me up til 4:30 am_ after a capsule taken at 2 pm. This has happened every time I take this stuff. Pseudoephedrine alone can't do that. Any others having insomnia after taking Semprex-D early in the day_ please comment_ so I know it's not my imagination.,It does a good job of clearing sinuses. So if it doesn't cause insomnia_ it's a very good decongestant/antihistamine.,F,52,4  days,5/6/2007,Semprex-d
