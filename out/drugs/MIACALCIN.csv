Had difficulty getting up from a sitting position. Woke up numerous times during the night with terrible pain in legs and hips.I stopped taking it Monday and already I think I feel better_ at least I'm hoping.

And I'm still not 100% sure that that is what was causing it.,I'm just on Combipatch HRT now and taking Calcium pills and a multivitamin every day. And watching my diet and trying to get more exercise. I'm hoping that is enough to stop the progression of this disease.
