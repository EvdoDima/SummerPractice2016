0, 4, Absence Seizures,My 9 yo was diagnosed with absence seizures and has been on zarontin for 8 months.  Initially_ the goal was 750 mg but at that dose he was in bad shape --- vomiting_ diarrhea_ and really exhausted.  We reduced the dose to to 600 mg daily_ his symptoms are controlled but he does have occasional hiccups_ diarrhea and headaches.  He has to take the medication with a meal to avoid vomiting.,,M,9,8  months600 mg 1X D,5/21/2016,Zarontin

3, 5, absence seizures,Seemed to conflict with vyvanse for ADHD so switched him to a different ADHD medication.Only 7 months and test showed no seizures.Started with just 1 pill daily because made him sleepy.

4, 4, Absence seizures,My son has been taking this for quite a while.  Initially it was a godsend.  He has always had memory problems and tiredness with it.  We weaned him off recently to see if he had outgrown his seizures_ which he had not.  When we put him back on it the memory and tiredness problems seem more significant.  It may be because when he was off the medication he noticed a big difference in how much better he felt physically except for the seizures.I was relieved to see others have had the memory problem. Our doctor said it wasn't the medication and he must be having breakthrough seizures even though the EEG didn't show any.,,M,16,4  years250 mg 2X D,7/4/2012Email,Zarontin
5, 5, absence seizures (petit-mal),my daughter (14) suffered from absence seizures for many years_ 5 to 10 times hourly_ awake and asleep.  The first neuro she went to prescribed Lamictal_ which I later found out is not usually the first line of defense for this type of seizure.  After reading up on it_ we decided to just deal with the seizures!  Then went to another neuro_ who told us that Zarontin (ethosuximide) is generally what is prescribed for absence.  I went home_ did my research_ and decided to give it a try.  It has been an answer to prayer for our family!  She has been seizure free since the first week with minimal side effects.  A little sleepy sometimes and some hiccups the first few weeks.  And she did not have to go up to the 500 mg 2x daily that is usually done.  We continue to pray.....  :)  I should add that I was terrified of the chemical side effects and we as a family_ very rarely take any prescriptions at all.  Hope this blesses someone and helps them with their decisions!,,F,14,9  months250 mg 2X D,12/13/2011,Zarontin
6, 4, Absence Seizures,Until stabilized my son has difficulty with concentrating and moods fluctuate.  Presents as being depressed if medication is not administered on time daily.  At higher doses he had bigger mood flucuations and difficulty with reading.  At the lower level he is still seizure free and is doing so much better at school.,Completely eliminated absence seizures although it took years to figure out the proper dosage.  If there are huge behavior changes I would suggest slowly lowering the dosage while ensuring seizures are gone.,M,6.5,3  years3 mls 2X D,11/30/2010Email,Zarontin

11, 1, Petit Mall Seizures,If I didn't take the medicine on a full stomach_ I would get dizzy and sometimes throw up. Bad memory... (that just may be me),I stopped taking the drug in 2002 b/c my seizures stopped. They came back in late '05. When I went to the doctor to get back on medication_ he asked me what I used to take. When I told him_ he started asking questions about my school work and how well I did in school. Aparently this drug impairs your ability to learn. He was surprised to learn that it did not affect me though. Overall though.... I hated this drug and would not recomend it. Lamictal is a much beter drug!,F,21,8  years,6/7/2006,Zarontin
