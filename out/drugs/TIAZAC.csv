2, 4, High blood pressure,Some ankle swelling,Over the years_ I've taken diltiazem HCL in several forms - - generic_ as cardizem and as tiazac.  All have been very satisfactory.  Unfortunately_ this single drug (at 240 mg a day dosage)could not completely control my high BP. I now also take altace (5 mg/day) and HCTZ (10 mg/day) and my BP is generally 120/75. I was prescribed the HCTZ_ a diuretic_ because of slight ankle swelling thought to be associated with the tiazac.,M,62,15  years,2/10/2005,Tiazac
