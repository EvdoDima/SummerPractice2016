0, 4, BV,I did not see a lot of patients describing hot flashes/fever as a side effect.  It would last for several hours the first night  but than gradually improving. It also caused sleeplessness the first 2 nights but after that it was getting better.  These are the only side effects I experienced and I completed the 5 day treatment.,,F,50,5  days75 mg 1X D,8/9/2016Email,Metrogel-vaginal
1, 5, Bacterial Vaginosis,As far as I know I didn't have any_ but some very mild cramps. the discharge wasn't as bad as everyone said it would be. I don't know if this is a side effect but the past few days I've been very emotional. Almost depressed. I just want to cry over every single thing_ and no my period is not coming.,With my anxiety I was terrified to take this because I put in my head that I would have such a bad time. But it was better than expected. I could say that the medicine gave me gas_ or made me feel sick. But I get gas a lot anyways. My job is hot and makes me feel sick. So I can't confirm that those were also side effects. Could have been coincidence. But over all it was great. I'd definitely use this again if needed.,F,24,5  days,8/1/2016Email,Metrogel-vaginal

5, 1, BV,Burnt  not just burning.  Actual chemically burnt  which caused crusting during healing process.  Long term damage is vulvodina,This is a sulfa based antibiotic as told to me by my dermatologist.  Reaction was similar to Steven johnson syndrome.  The physician should have not given this to me nor the flagyl_ due to my previous adverse reaction to Sulfa antibiotics causing damage to my liver.   Most physicians do not know that this and flagyl are in the Sulfa antibiotic category.,F,,1  days 1X D,1/29/2016Email,Metrogel-vaginal
6, 5, Bv,None really if any maybe slight cramping in pelvic area at times.,I've been using metrogel for about 5 years about 2-3 times a year. It works great. It gets rid of my bv and it only comes back when my ex and I mess around without protection. The clucky white stuff u guys keep mentioning is not discharge lol. It is the excess medication coming out that doesn't absorb into your body. It brings the infection out. Same as with semen. It slides out of u but it's not your discharge. Come on ladies. It should all be gone about 2 days after finishing.,F,28,5  days,1/23/2016,Metrogel-vaginal

9, 5, bv,Thick white clumpy discharge from day two of treatment,I think the product worked really well for the bv. Smell was gone after 1st application. But the discharge had me so concerned. Especially since I am 13 weeks pregnant. It is extremely thick and gross looking sometimes with the brownish purplish clumps. But my mind is at ease now after reading these comments. Thanks guys.

11, 4, Bv,Got my period the first day I started taking metro gel. If you do this_ prepare to be horrified at some point or another. In addition to the normal menstrual blood_ the gel mixes in with it and produces its own brown clumps. Imagine my shock when I passed a quarter-sized clot multiple times. Called doctor in a panic_ she didn't seem too concerned which was reassuring_ but it was not okay. I've had light cramping and food tastes bland_ with loss of appetite. Also a migraine on the first day which never came back.,Great for getting rid of the vile smell_ side effects are scary. Prefer the tablets.,F,25,5  days,12/4/2015Email,Metrogel-vaginal

13, 4, Had BV & Yeast,So this was my first time ever  having BV. Yeast are common for me & I usually know when I get them_ so when I'm getting this gross smell (sorry) & horrible discharge I knew something was up. At first my gyn. gives me a single dose yeast pill....a few days later calls me back & says it looked like I had a bit of BV too so she prescribed the gel for that. I did not use it at first because everything went back to normal no smell no discharge. Discharge tried to come back so that's when I decided maybe I should use this gel. Used it & I was feeling sick like I've seen other on these reviews say but of course I thought it was just me. I had to take the gel day & night but in the day it was pretty messy so I wore a painty liner. I couldn't really see the discharge until I wiped & seen HUGE CLOTS of it just sitting there. No smell_ watery_ toilet tissue paper like discharge. It's now my first night off & I want to say the discharge is gone. I had it earlier in the morning but that was pretty much it. Some people have their discharge longer but I'm hopping it's gone & I don't have to deal with it anymore! Best of luck to you Guys,,F,21,5  days0.75%,11/26/2015,Metrogel-vaginal

20, 4, Bacterial infection,I didn't have any signs or symptoms of an infection so it was a surprise that I was given an Rx for this gel. I began taking it at night and literally within thirty mins of insertion I would feel very tired as if I had taken a couple bennedryls and then pass out! Every time. Then the whitish burgundy tissue like clumps began. Only when I urinated or wiped and huge clumps were coming out but I never felt them pass! They were just there. The nurse told me it's the gel coming out that's all. But I had some major irritation around my anus because the gel just comes out and is in that area for so long. That lasted two days near the end. I am four days after the completion of my last dosage and I still have the clumps. I'm told that it should clear up this week. Other than that I'm good. Just wish I knew before hand so I didn't freak out,It woks_ it's just a very strong antibiotic and can make you feel a bit off.,F,33,5  days.75mg,10/27/2015,Metrogel-vaginal

Turned Clear after day 5 but the clear discharge isn't as thin as it should be.,I think it makes the vagina dry and a dry vagina can equal a yeast infection.

32, 4, Bv,Felt a little off balance (dizzy)? And had some itching,"Last night was the last dose for my treatment. I've had Bv off and on for about 2 years now_ was using the cleocin gel but it seems like that medicine stopped working for me so I went ahead and tried metrogel. I haven't really experienced the ""clumpy cottage cheese discharge"" like most have but what little does come out makes me itch. The smell is gone but I'm curious to whether it has killed the bacteria bc of the itching or if it may caused a yeast infection. I guess we shall see in the next couple days. I just can't wait to get back in bed with my man. There needs to be more research on this shit_ it's a degrading thing to deal with :(",F,21,5  days,8/1/2015,Metrogel-vaginal
33, 5, BV,"I have had BV in the past a fair amount - having an IUD makes you more succeptable. The white discharge thick is a side effect of treatment but the wet toilet paper - that appears to me to be uterine lining shedding a bit. When I had my IUD placed_ a pap_ or having a membrane sweep done x2 when I was pregnant with my son I got the same type of ""pieces of tissue"" with a pink colour or looking like pink coffee grounds. With nydagel I have had pieces be slightly pink but mostly losing all the colour and white. It clears up shortly after stopping the gel. Ultimately topically way better than oral flagyl!!! I found that the flagyl cream doesn't give you the same side effects but I much prefer nydagel",,F,28,5  days,7/25/2015,Metrogel-vaginal

Day 4 i noticed some bleeding which freaked me out_ i read it was an UnCommon side effect_ but it was not my period_ my period has stopped due to my birth control_ so i knew it was the gel. Later that day it turned to brown muscus. Day 5 just brown Speckles everytime i go to the Bathroom. I didnt really have the white clumpy discharge that everyone else here is saying_ just brown Discharge. Im one day off_ and still some brown speckles. Hopefully that goes away soon.

I have no odor_ no itching or burning etc. Just this white junk that I hope will go away soon!,"In all honesty they should list the white cottage cheese discharge as a MAJOR Side effect and that it is completely NORMAL. We should know what to expect so that we know it's the medicine working and not some horrific infection. It would be like someone giving you a laxative and saying ""here_ take this for 5 days"" ...and then you having no idea that it is going to make you have to go pooo.

I searched the internet thinking it was a yeast issue caused by the antibiotic and read that it was a common side effect but if I had it I needed to CALL MY DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.  That really freaked me out.  It was midnight when I discovered it.  Luckily I found this site and so I realize it seems to happen A LOT.

I started taking it before I started the metrogel and after 2 days of taking at I started feeling much better. I noticed a calming in the older and the itching stopped. She told me to keep taking that even after the treatments then that should help stop the recurring bv.

The clumpy white rubbery cottage cheese like discharge should be duly noted in the insert as a known side effect to ease many of the women whom experience this_ their fears and/or worries.,"This prescription of Metronidazole Vaginal Gel 0.75% is  great and it works well with me.  I've had maybe 4 BV's in the past year and I often wondered if  your sexually active with your mate should he be treated as well. If your being treated and he's not then he's only giving you back what you've just rid yourself of. In addition_ I've been trying to educate myself a little more on this condition (BV) that we as women must  be sure our Vaginal PH levels are normal. When it's not this is a reason why we have repeated cycles of BV. What I started taking to help balance my vaginal ph levels is Women's Probiotic. It helps promote healthy yeast balance and support vaginal flora balancing and urinary health.  It also helps replenish good bacteria.. The product is called ""ULTIMATE FLORA -RTS"" WOMEN'S PROBIOTIC 15 Billion_ 8 Probiotic Strains 3o Capsules...Just for your FYI. Good Luck Ladies!!!  METROGEL-VAGINAL  is a wonder drug. Rids you of the Foul Smelling Fish Like Odor which is very embarrassing within 1-2 days of using  this prescription drug.",F,48,5  days,11/2/2014,Metrogel-vaginal

It looks like a bad cold with goat cheese stirred in with a few splashes of ketchup every now and then (gross). I've had it before but it stopped at the end of the one week treatment.

Until last year_ I had typical BV symptoms. Went to three different DR's and was tested for everything under the sun..including BV. ALL TESTS RETURNED NEGATIVE. BUT I KNEW THIS ODOR QUITE WELL. SO I ASKED FOR Rx of metro-gel anyway. The pharmaceutical company Walgreens had recently contracted with was Sandoz. I picked up my Rx which was 1×day @ 5 day. I used it for 5 days after day 4_ the fishy discharge was still very prominent. So I contacted the Dr and had a new Rx called in to CVS. Got Rx and after 3 days of using the Prasco brand of Metro-gel_ odor was all gone and I have had no issues since. Up until recently_ I accidentally got some soap a little too far inside my vaginal area and within a couple of days I noticed fishy odor. I knew right away what was going on. I called my Dr had Rx for metro-gel called in. I've been using it for 3 days now out of the 7 and odor is still present.

109, 1, Bacterial vaginosis,I was prescribed the gel because i had had BV a few months ago and was given oral flagyl_ and because i was also prescribed an oral antibiotic for a sinus infection at the same time. With the oral flagyl_ i was pretty sick through the full course of treatment. this time I experienced the full range of side effects: headache_ sore throat_ nausea_ diarrhea_ cramping_ gas_ bloating_ discharge_ sinus infection_ yeast infection_ irritability_ depression_ and lethargy. Honestly_ the cure has been worse than the BV. Who would have thought that a vaginal gel would pack such a wallop?  Additionally_ the insert says the gel's effectiveness rate is only around 50%--leading me to ask why I went through all of this for what could well be no good reason? If it doesn't clear this time_ I don't know what I will do. But I know what I won't do: use any more Flagyl products!

141, 4, BV,None,I began experiencing a fishy odor that had never been there before. I did some research online and saw that semen and/or glycerin soap could be the cause (both of which I had been exposed to). A new sexual partner may also be the cause. I bought the Vagisil ph kit and my level was 7. Visited the doc who prescribed Metrolgel and Fluconozale simultaneously. The gel was for the BV and the other for a possible yeast infection. Unfortunatly the gel kills all the bacteria putting you at risk of a yeast infection - the Fluconozale takes care of that. I got two doses: one to take at the beginning of treatment and one to take after the five days of Metrogel. I also went out and bought a probiotic from the health food store. They sell the live cultures refrigerated - Renew Ultimate Flora Vaginal Support. It's pricey but I think well worth it (make sure the pro biotic you get is NOT dairy based which may have an adverse reaction). I'm also taking a dose of cranberry tablets and garlic tablets just to boost my immune system a bit. I take veggie based prenatal vitamins as a habit for slight hair loss and I think the folic acid in them has also helped me. I've been on probiotics_ cran and garlic for 5 days_ vitamins for about a year_ and I just had my first dosage of Metro last night. I notice the odor is at least 50% less and I'm hoping all will be over soon. I will use rephresh gel a few days after the gel treatment hopefully just for maintenance and then assess how my body is reacting.,F,34,5  days5 grams 1X D,3/31/2012,Metrogel-vaginal

Day 2: Cramping is gone_ but metallic taste in my mouth remains; higher anxiety than normal (I'm prone to anxiety and am on Prozac... I just seemed more anxious than normal and more apt to have random panic attacks); fast heart rate. Day 3 and onward: anxiety; some vaginal itching; clear or yellow gel coming out. I did not experience the white_ clumpy discharge (just the gel coming out in the morning and afternoon_ which is normal).,My doctor prescribed Metrogel for a possible BV infection and pH imbalance. I took it for 5 days at night before going to bed. I experienced mild side effects. The anxiety bothered me the most out of everything_ though. I heard the pill form can cause extreme anxiety_ but not the gel. My anxiety level just seemed higher than normal and it was a bit uncomfortable for a while_ but not unbearable. The metallic taste in my mouth was annoying_ but tolerable. It subsided a bit on day 3 and onward. Other than that_ I had no issues and did not experience the white_ chunky discharge a lot of people have. I also took Diflucan for a possible yeast infection one day before starting Metrogel and am taking probiotic pills everyday. This helps to prevent any yeast infections from occurring during treatment_ too.

I got 3 days into using the gel before I started bleeding.  I've discontinued use because it's rather unnerving_ but it's 3 days later and the bleeding has continued.  It started as a very mild amount the first day and I've had lots of that disgusting tissuey discharge.  The bleeding might possibly have to do with my IUD?  There's no sign of BV anymore_ but I really hope that the rest of this sh*t stops soon because I'm starting to freak out.,F,27,5  days 1X D,11/26/2011Email,Metrogel-vaginal

I will up date this next week after my colposcopy. I believe I got my BV from my IUD insertion since the symptoms started within the week of the procedure.

After using it the first night I did notice the smell was gone like most of you said. Day two some of the discharge was gone. After thinking yes this is going to help I thought wrong. The discharge came back and about a week after finishing using it_ and the smell is back. So I fell like i'm back to square one.

I took the pill and inserted that gel one a night.  I had clumpy white cottage cheese stuff every morning.  And every time I would urinate it would hurt right after.  I also noticed alot of tingling down there..it's hard to explain.  It's now July 26 and I still have tingling and pain right after I urinate_ the pain wont go away so easily either it just lags and stays there for awhile...I've been to a urulogist and they said I have nothing wrong with my bladder or urethra they didn't find any bacteria or white cells in my urine.  They are now referring me to a Gyno...I'm so tired of this...my pain is still there when I urinate and so is that annoying tingling_ kind of like chills down there and I feel like I still have something.  The doctor has checked down there and no bacteria the BV is gone but i dont know if the gel burned or made me really sensitive even to my own urine.

205, 2, BV,Bad taste in mouth_ stomach cramps_ dizziness_ fatigue,"I began this treatment yesterday.  I had underwent a five day very strong course of antibiotic about a month ago for a broken finger which I needed stitches.  After the antibiotic I began to experience symptoms which were associated with a yeast infection_ so I started an over the counter yeast infection treatment for 5 days.  Symptoms began getting worse.  Went to the dr and she gave me a one time use yeast infection pill and a cream.  I took it and they called me a few days later and said that my labs showed a bacterial infection so she prescribed the metrogel.  As soon as I took it I remember that I had taken this a few years ago and had awful side effects.  A very bad almost ""metal"" taste in my mouth_ stomach cramps an dizziness.  Also my period had started two days ago and now I'm not bleeding at all... I should have read the directions before_ I am going on vacation this week_ leaving in 2 days.  Does anyone know what would happen if I doubled up on the gel? This is the only vacation I have all year and to not be able to drink at all the whole time... just kind of sucks.  Although it's def not worth it to deal w/ the side effects.  I def just can't stop taking it now though right_ and resume when I get back from the trip? Or double up tomorrow and the next day so I can at least have a few drinks at the end of the week?

209, 4, BV,I'm currently on day 3 and I've experienced lower back pain_ especially in the evening. I Didn't think it was related until I saw similar side effects from other users. I also had crazy thick discharge that was odorless_ opaque in color with some pinkish flecks_ and looked like toilet paper that had balled up_ wet_ and then rubbed between hands. I figured it was the BV being expelled_ so didn't really worry and then saw this forum and realized I was right. I have had some mild cramping_ but I also have a copper IUD and it has given me mid-cycle cramps before. My itching_ discomfort went away within a few hours of dose 1. The only other side effect I've noticed is I haven't had much of an appetite. I am surprised that I'm not seeing the medication expel out like a lot of OTC products. Only the discharge I mentioned above_ and to me it's reassuring because I know the med is working. So far things are great and only rated 4 stars as I have not completed the cycle.,I would recommend reading the pamphlet that comes with this medication. I noticed some reviewers stating that had a horrible experience and yet they drank alcohol. This medication clearly states not to indulge in alcohol or sex while using it. BV can be given to your partner. Alcohol diminishes the effectiveness and creates nausea/vomiting_ depending on dosage and user.,F,23,5  days 2X D,6/14/2011,Metrogel-vaginal

236, 1, BV,Passed out_ faint_ dizzy_ abdominal pain.,I was prescribed this since the oral version of Flagyl almost sent me to the ER due to its side effects.  I was assured the gel form works differently and the side effects weren't as bad; however I was still hesitant about taking it.  Turns out I had a right to be.  I woke up the first morning after using it_ walked into the bathroom_ blacked out and collapsed on the floor.  My bf said he wouldn't have believed me if he hadn't seen it.  It took me 20 minutes of laying on the bathroom floor before I could even get to bed.  After laying around I felt okay enough to work in the afternoon but was still dizzy and faint all day.  This stuff is poison for me_ in any form.  If you're allergic to the oral Flagyl_ beware you might be just as allergic to this.  I've been prescribed Clindamycin now.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm tempted to just let the BV resolve itself since I have no symptoms (found out on a pap)_ but the doc says I can't because said pap was also abnormal.

The first time I used the 500mg pill form - an absolute nightmare. I told my doctor so she gave me the gel. A LOT easier to use. I inserted the gel before bed. No crazy side effects like with the pill. I reported those on this site before. I did have the gel come out in the morning_ kind of an off-white cloudy gel substance_ not a big deal. I usually dont dream at night but found myself dreaming about talking frogs and weird stuff like that. The last couple days I did nothing but toss and turn all night and i work early in the morning so ive been tired. Other than that_ it wasnt bad.

I experienced clear thin discharge with an odor and after an examination and looking at everything under a microscope_ the doctor prescribed this. After the first couple of nights_ it initially helped with the burning/itching and the clear discharge. However on the third night I had a really difficult time even inserting the applicator and I noticed a clumpy white goo.

249, 3, Bacteria Vaginois,Some tingling while taking the meds and clump white discharge 1-2 days following the 5 day treatment,I am so so happy to find this site regarding BV. I have been suffering from BV for about 3 years now and unfortunately all the doc continues to tell me is that it is a pesky recurring infection.  Thankfully it is not sexually transmitted but as most of us know aside from the fish odor_ it can be very disruptive to your sex life.  I have tried everything on the market_ Flagyl_ Tindamex_ Vinegar and Water douche and lastly the Metro gel. I just finished my last dose of Metro last week and I'm now experiencing the white clumpy discharge_ similarly to ricotta cheese. I'm so happy you ladies posted since I thought it was possibly a yeast infection which fortunately I do not get often but I had no itch which usually one of the signs. It seems like the white clumpy discharge is a side effect of the gel. Ugh! I'm hoping my problem is finally resolved but it seems to be the symptoms come back after my menstrual cycle.

What a nightmare! Day 3 I ended up in the ER by ambulance.  I was admitted for reoccurring syncope (fainting/blackouts)_ low blood pressure 83/74)_ cramping_ and headache_ all side-effects of metro-gel.  Doc said so many people have a bad reaction to Flagyl (an ingredient in metro-gel).  I suggest trying ANY other remedy_ either natural or prescribed before taking this.  It was just horrible_ messy_ and caused a yeast infection to top it all off.,Beware!  Read the paper that comes inside the medication box.  Know the signs of allergic reaction and side-effects.

After finishing medication on day 6 I did have bloody/clear discharge- but relieved to find that is somewhat normal.,I have had BV twice before and I hate it. I have treated myself with Garlic supplements and Acidophils- which does work.  I recently got out of a 3 moth Monogamous relationship and started Oracea for Rosacea (a low dose antibiotic) both of which triggered my BV again. I went to the OB thinking I had an STI- was relieved to find out it wasn't. The Metrogel helped- All of my BV symptoms are gone! No itching_ no redness or rash_ no irritation and no sticky discharge. If you experience white clumpy discharge I would recommend getting treatment for a yeast infection!  This medication does not prevent yeast! It CAN and WILL promote it. I took a dose of Diflucan 2 days before treatment and again on the 6th day after I finished. No clumpy white discharge so far_ only clear/bloody discharge which is the infection leaving my body. I am STILL experiencing bad bladder pain. I did a follow up with my OB Doc. and he suspects I have Interstitial Cystitis. I have made an appointment with a Urologist. If you suspect you have this condition DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION! It only irritates/inflames and makes everything worse. Other than the bladder pain_ this medication worked.

After all of that I did not have the infection come back until I got strep throat and had to take antibiotics.  After my course of antibiotics I got a yeast infection and then BV.  I had stop taking some of the stuff because I had been doing so well and the cost adds up quickly.  I have started the gel again and taking all of my other stuff again.

284, 4, BV,some cramping_ maybe tiredness (hard to tell whether that was earned in a different way)_ white clumpy yeast like discharge_ maybe a little nausea/dizziness,I rinsed with a Boric Acid solution (boil 8 cups of water and dissolve 1 tsp of boric acid in it while hot_ cover and use as a rinse several times a day)_ and I also douched with a hydrogen peroxide solution of 1/4 c peroxide to 1 c water to prevent yeast growth.  I figured out those steps from other things I read on the internet.  No dr. suggested it but boric acid helps keep ph low and peroxide kills yeast and is made naturally in the vagina.  I wasn't able to follow the dr. suggestion of two five day treatments with a 3 day break.  I did 3_ got my period_ got the infection symptoms back_ then I did 4 days of metro gel.  Last dose was 3 days ago-no infections symptoms.  Last white discharge was 2 days ago,F,40,5  days 1X D,8/12/2010,Metrogel-vaginal

So don't be scared by what others say try it yourself you may find it's not that bad! A word of advice take yeast infection meds the first day you start this medication to avoid any yeast or discharge problem. I took Diflu_ it's a one time pill and last for seven days in the body.

I was soo worried and embarrassed every time I had sex with my boyfriend. We have been together for 6 yrs and he is the only man I have had sex with since I've been with him. He obviously noticed it because of the smell and I told him I had no clue what it was. I've never had any odor problems up until now. So I called my Ob/Gyn and they prescribe Metrogel without even having to see me. I've heard that stress has a lot to do with it_ as does an imbalance of the bacteria in the vagina. So I started taking the Metrogel 3 nights ago and have 2 more nights to go(thank God). I have experienced very little symptoms_ including light cramping(normal)_ until today that I had this thick_ red-pinkish clumpy discharge. I do not have the fish-like odor anymore(thank God again) I have been doing research for the past hour in half and have come to learn that the discharge is very normal.

334, 3, Because my doctor told me to,During treatment_ white clumpy discharge with blood mixed in it on underwear; after treatment white clumpy discharge that stays lodged inside of me.,I used the gel for 5 days.  I have been completed with the treatment for almost a week but I still have the white clumpy discharge_ but it doesn't come out.  It seems stuck inside of me.  I am not sure why my doctor told me to use this medicine so I can't say if it helped my symptoms because I didn't have any.  But I wish this discharge would stop.  My husband was grossed out by sex because stuff was coming out on him.  When does this go away?,F,31,5  days,1/27/2010Email,Metrogel-vaginal
335, 3, BV,Nausea_ lightheadedness_ cramps_ strange metallic/mediciney taste in my mouth_ headache_ fatigue_ diarhea.  Icky slimy red-brown goo discharge_ but I haven't had the white discharge like others experienced (that sounds like a yeast infection).,I had only the mildest of symptoms and was at my Gyn for my annual check up and mentioned it.  She looked at a smear under the microscope and said it was BV and game me the choice of the gel or pill. I chose the gel.  I feel horrible.  I'm glad I found this site because I thought the red-brown goo was an early onset of my period mixing with the medication.  (Interesting that residual medication turns that color.)  I can't wait to be finished this and just hope I don't get a rebound yeast infection.  I can't believe there isn't something else available that would work on this problem and not have these side effects -we're not exactly talking about a rare condition here.,F,47,5  days,1/26/2010Email,Metrogel-vaginal
336, 5, BV,None whatsoever.,I had to take this after the oral version (Flagyl) caused extreme nausea. I had absolutely no side effects from Metrogel. I was a bit nervous after reading all the comments here about women experiencing weird toilet-papery discharge. I had no discharge at all; it seemed like all the medication that wasn't absorbed came out when I urinated first thing in the morning. I also drank wine in moderation while using Metrogel with no reaction although this is discouraged due to the oral version being notorious for horrible_ Antabuse-type reactions to alcohol consumption. Overall I highly recommend this drug and will never use Flagyl again. As a side note_ I also took probiotics during the course of treatment with Metrogel to counteract the negative effects of the antibiotic_ and I plan to continue to take probiotics to avoid any further vaginal infections.,F,40,5  days,1/16/2010,Metrogel-vaginal
337, 3, BV,The first few days I only experienced grayish watery discharge with pinkish infection in the middle in the morning with a bowel movement (like a blob). Did 6 at night treatments. I am on day 11_ the past 4 or 5 days I have had curdy white discharge as everyone else. Just when I think its gone_ there it is again. Very discouraging as its so gross. Lower back pain and cramping throughout treatment. Just ant to be sexual again.,I am not sure I would take this again. The symptoms are horrible but hopefully the infection will be cleared. If not better in two days calling doctor.,F,20,6  days,1/14/2010,Metrogel-vaginal
338, 4, Yeast Infection,A lot of white discharge after the first 2 days of treatment_ bad cramps and also bloating.  Warning: do not drink any alcohol with this medication_ I forgot that I was on this medication and had a glass of wine with dinner one night and wasn't able to eat for 3 days after that_ felt like throwing up.,,F,21,5  days,1/12/2010,Metrogel-vaginal
339, 3, BV,"The 5th day_ i put in a bit more than usual (I just wanted to make sure it worked) and became extremley nauseated. Its been about 4 days since I've finished the metro gel and this clumpy white crap is STILL coming out of me. It DOES look like balled up tissue_ the consistency is thick and gross_ it's white and there is no odor_ no itching_ no burning. I am terrified to be intimate with anyone because i don't want anyone to think i have ""something"". How long will this continue. My annual exam is in two weeks_ so we'll see.

340, 5, BV,Mild abdominal cramping_ white clumpy dishcharge_ bloody dishcharge,I definitely prefer this medication. I hate the pills which caused many_ many side effects beside tasing horribly.  I've taken the gel many times and always works like a charm_ despite side effects.  For those who are/were pregnant_ the pamphlet I was given does state that this med should not be given in the first trimester because it could end in miscarriage.,F,33,2  days,1/7/2010,Metrogel-vaginal
341, 3, BV,burning_ white clumpy discharge_ reddish brown discharge,i did not have a lot of discharge or a smell but after going in for my yearly exam i was told  that i had BV_ i am only on day 2 of treatment but i was alarmed when i saw so much strange discharge sense the gel was clear_ i am hoping that this clears up and after the 5 days i am ready for intercourse_ i was severely dry (not usually a problem of mine) for about a week before the doctor told me i had BV maybe the infection cause my dryness,F,20,2  days,12/8/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
342, 3, BV,Had a little abdominal cramping and felt a little light headedwith a yeast infection.,I think metrogel is better than the pills the pills are awful I was vomiting ever time I took it and after the I was done taking the medication went back to the doctor and still had BV. Metrogel works for me people have to understand that medications effect different people in different ways if you have not taken a medication before you should ask your doctor and read the insert before taking it I did. I aslo experienced a yeast infection which was horrible but my doctor told me that metrogel may tamper with the normal flora in my vagina and a yeast infection may occur. I received medication for the yeast infection and was fine. My doctor also suggested that I take the one day pill for the yeast infection soon as I start the medication for BV which works for me,F,34,5  days,12/6/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
343, 5, BV,dizziness + increased heart rate with first dose only_ clumpy discharge.,"I posted on 11/20. I completed the five day course almost a week ago_ and all my symptoms are gone. It's great to be back to normal! The creepy white discharge went away a day or two after the final dose. Though_ I think finally having sex helped clean it out... I'm also wondering why the pamphlet mentions only ""discharge"" for the side effects_ and not ""white clumps."" I don't consider discharge and white clumps to be the same thing!",F,22,5  days,11/27/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
344, 3, BV,I too am having the white clumpy discharge_ but it did not start until 2 days after I finished the medication.,I did go and buy Monostat 1 day pill because I thought I was getting a yeast infection. I wish I had read this site first. Do any of you know how long the discharge lasts? One woman said it went away after 5 days. Can anyone else tell me their experience? How long did it take for the excessive white/clumpy discharge to go away for you?,F,34,5  days,11/27/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
345, 5, BV,White / sometimes a little brown chunky discharge - like wet toilet paper - odourless and no itching. No other pain (eg burning) or side effects as described by others on this site.  Lucky me!,Cleared up my BV which the oral medication did not - I took 3 oral courses and it kept recurring_ but now the smell is gone.  I am very surprised that there is nothing on the product disclosure brochure about the white discharge.  I was quite concerned about it and went to my doctor today who has now done a swab and sent it for examination and is also calling my gynaecologist for advice.  All of this drama could have been avoided if this side effect was listed on the pack.  My doctor said that the discharge did not look like thrush and the rest of my vagina and vulva looked normal.  My question is..... how much longer will this discharge go on for?  I finished taking the gel for a week now and I'm still getting it.  And_ what does it mean?  Is it a secondary infection or a beneign side effect that will simmply pass.  Irresponsible of the manufacturers not to address these issues.,F,36,7  days,11/25/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
346, 5, BV,None_ beyond a little discharge on the 5th day.  I didn't encounter any of the other symptoms mentioned here_ i.e. odd discharge_ burning or dizzyness.  The drug seemed to work as advertised.  This is the first time I've taken this drug_ and really had no adverse side effects.,I took this drug after I was diagnosed with BV.  Major symptom was itching and irritation.  By day three on Metrogel those symptoms were resolved_ and I began to feel much better.  I will say that before starting the Metrogel I started taking FemDophilus_ took it during my 5 day course_ and will continue for at least a couple of weeks.  It is supposed to: 1. increase the cure rate of the drug; 2. keep a potential yeast infection away; and 3. rebalance your flora so bv doesn't come back.  It has been a week since I finished the last dose and so far so good.,F,46,5  days,11/23/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
347, 4, bacterial vaginosis,increased heart rate and a bit of dizziness after first dose. Not enough to make me stop taking it.,Tonight is my 4th dose (out of five). The odor and inflammation is completely gone. I inserted the gel right before bed_ so I didn't have any problems with leaking. You have to hold the applicator in place when you fill it_ or else it shoots off :) I have a noticeable amount of clumpy white discharge (odorless)_ which I'm hoping isn't the beginning of a yeast infection_ but I'm not too worried about it. I read this site before going to the gyno and it freaked me out! But I have to say_ MetroGel is working and I really don't have any side effects. I would recommend it for bacterial vaginosis_ but_ as you other ladies have proven_ it's not for everyone!,F,22,5  days,11/20/2009,Metrogel-vaginal

The first day after applying it_ it burned like hell off and on throughout the day as the gel leaked out.  My skin was bright red_ but it seems to have subsided today.  Hope it works!,F,25,2  days,11/19/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
349, 1, BV,Abdominal Cramping (very bad..and I have a high tolerance for pain. I couldn't even pull in my abdominal muscles). Lower back pain. White discharge that looks like little pieces of toilet paper. Something mixed with the gel (but white in color) dropped out of my vagina into the toilet..made a huge splash.,Ok_ so this medication has yet to clear up any symptoms_ actually I have more symptoms than I started out with. I had an odor and some itching to start out with (I thought the itching was an allergic reaction because the hole of my behind itches too). NOW I have itching still in my vagina and behind_ but it has spread upward to my labia too_ discharge_ and hard pain in my abdomen and lower back. I couldn't wait until the weekend was over to call my doctor. I called him today and explained the symptoms_ telling him that I may have a worse yeast infection now (I tried to tell him that I still have the itching from BV but he kept interrupting)..he said that the discharge may be some fluids mixed with the gel and that I should immediately stop the gel_ take some tylenol and call him wednesday. I'm hesitant about stopping the  medication_ I will still need something else because the itching is STILL here. Scratching my vagina with my nails is not sanitary and it hurts.,F,28,4  days,11/16/2009Email,Metrogel-vaginal

I was just checked for a UTI and it feels like pain level of 10.  It hase been 40 hours since the one and only dose and I am still in extreme pain.

The chunks were huge and hard unlike anything I've seen_ very embarassing if you wany to have intercourse. My doctor suggested to douche with viniger/water solution.

My doctor actually prescribed something the causes abdorminal pain_ when I came to here for abdorminal pain. She never mentioned how to use the stuff_ what it was for_ what the side effects were.

Also had a little cramping on both days of discharge...felt a tiny bit itchy but that's normal for me I think.,It's not bad other than the discharge...freaked me out a little bit.

I dont think its a yeast infection cuz it does not smell or burn. It does itch but it not bad_ I can deal with it. I got female wipes like the anti-itch and it cleans up the white discharge better than TP_ and clears up the itch.,The Dr. didn't really explain to me why I needed it but just that I seem to have an increase it discharge and a small odor but thats it. She never told me what to do or expect what just read the direction. I will never go back to her.

I cant be 100% sure it was the medicine_ but it makes me wonder.,If I were using this medicine and NOT PREGNANT I would have given it a 4 or 5.

How this is fDA approved is beyond me- and nothing written on the booklet- CLASS ACTION SUIT- contact me if you think it's ridiculous that nobody is advocating about this very serious issue and putting stop to it.I do not believe women would voluntarily take this if the precautions where there.

360, 4, bacterial vaginitus,The only side effect was a little burning at first which went away by day 2.,This medicine helped with the discomfort and that constance itch and burning of skin went a way after a few days of use. The doctor told me to use gel for 10 days twice a day because I have type two diabetes. I got this because I was on antibiotics for a few weeks. I also have been taking probiotics and eating yogurt.I do stay away from sugar etc. It seems that with diabetes it is easy to get these infections know matter what you do. The itch itch just came back today after a few months so I am on my second prescription of the medicine. Just started using it today and the itch is under control already. So glad for this medicine and will use it again. It has made my life better but just want this to finally go away for good. Thanks to this web site I knew what to expect from using the gel the first time. I too wish that all the warnings where printed on the paper that happen from using the gel. Maybe our doctors should better inform us what to expect from using this gel. Hopefully this time the medicine will cure it for good and it will stay gone.,F,60,10  days,9/25/2009,Metrogel-vaginal

I'm not fully sure if it was yeast_ but I just tried to rinse out (keeping very clean)_ and it was gone about 5/6 days after the last dose.. waiting to see if it might be yeast_ or what.

I didn't get side effects except for the white discharge which everyone was freaking out about_ but I with every vaginal cream/gel I've used I've had this. It's normal_ what goes up must come down.

Today was MUCH worse- (so much_ it looked like a bm)  I am thankful to all of you writing about this- I called the doctor's office back not to have him call when I came across this site and the many responses.,I am worried about the consequences of this medication.

Normal white clear clumping with the red/brown specs by day 3. This all seems to be normal results of the gel working_ unless hives rashes or short of breath occur. Use a over the counter itch cream for outside burning and itching if persistent and bothersome. Taking acidophilus while on the medication will decrease the risk of a yeast infection_ but if it still remains a prescription for yeast may be administered by your doctor. I would not recommend taking over the counter yeast infection treatments because they can cause the BV to come back.,,F,24,4  days,6/17/2009,Metrogel-vaginal

381, 5, BV,dark grainy bits & clear discharge (the extra gel leaving my body),BV cleared up pretty fast.  The grainy bits in discharge freaked me out at first because I wasn't expecting it & I couldn't find any info on it until I found this site.  Good to know that it's relatively normal_ ha.  Signs of BV came back soon after quitting the treatment so I picked it back up for a few days.  So far so good.  SOO glad I found this site!,F,24,5  days,5/11/2009,Metrogel-vaginal

383, 5, Discharge,After the second day of starting Metrogel I began having the clumpy toilet paper discharge. I also noticed that I became light headed on two occasions which I don't know for sure can be from the medication. However_ since MG is an antibiotic which can also cause yeast infections_ it is safe to say that this is why we're getting the clumps_ But Geez why didn't our doctors warn us about this seeing that it is a VERY common PROBLEM!!!!!,THEY SHOULD REALLY INCLUDE THIS VERY ANNOYING SIDE EFFECT ON THE PRINTED INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED WITH THIS MEDICATION.,F,31,4  days,5/8/2009Email,Metrogel-vaginal

385, 4, BV,I only experienced mild nausea on days 4 and 5 of treatment_ and a general ill health feeling.  The first few days_ I did not experience any side effects.  The smelly discharge went away immediately.  I've also been taking acidophilus (the pill form) and yogurt with fruit for breakfast.  My doctor told me that the gel will come back out white (this was before I even started the metrogel)_ so I was prepared.  So far_ I haven't even experienced the clumpy white discharge_ but I haven't had sex with my husband yet either.,Overall_ I think this is a good product.  Side effects were mild_ and it ultimately cleared the smelly fishy odor and leaky discharge.  This was my first bv infection so hopefully it won't come back!!!!  Think positive thoughts.,F,33,5  days,5/5/2009,Metrogel-vaginal

I used it for the 5 days_ my symptoms went away after 2 days of treatment. Three weeks after treatment_ I began having mild symptoms again (fishy smell upon showering with soap) so I began using it again last night.

397, 3, BV,Cottage cheese_ I find it was closer to the wet toilet paper shnivels_ until I found a huge clump. I was completely scared. I'm also administering a drug to myself for a UTI_ I was dead frightened this was a side effect of that. Doesn't help that I'm pregnant and don't trust my body with most drugs- prescribed or not. I don't seem to be the type to often gets medicinal side effects_ so it's day three and all I've had so far is cheese. Whew...,I say you should apply this stuff only if you NEED it. It's grody and the applicators I was given don't have a tapered end_ so inserting them into an already irritated and wounded feeling vagina isn't quite the best feeling one could have.,F,20,5  days,3/5/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
398, 1, BV,OMG! I'm so glad that I found this site because I was ready to go to the doctor because I thought that something was terribly wrong with me. But_ after reading all of the other comments I have calmed down. I didn't even think about how these symptoms only started happening after I began my first dose until I stumbled upon this site while I was frantically searching the internet for possible reasons for this brown tissue like substance. It all makes so much sense to me_ I used this medicine for 3 days and started having these symptoms but my period was on it's way so I thought that maybe it was because of that. Then while I was on my period the substance stopped but my Doctor had recommeded that I take another dose after my period finished when he prescribed it to me_ so I did take another dose on Tuesday and while I was taking a shower Thursday a ball of brown tissue came out and freaked me the hell out again.

I supposed that it meant the gel must be working but it is very scary. I never had the ""fishy odor"" or any other symptoms of BV and I have another obgyn appointment tomorrow and am going to be very upset if this gel caused me a yeast infection. I had read somewhere that sometimes BV is misdiagnosed in women who have always had more discharge than others and believe that may apply to me. Years ago a doctor told me I had Trichomonas and when i went for a second opinion the second doctor told me that I did not and it was just my bodys natural production of more mucus.

I really wish they would explain this as a normal side effect on the package_ instead of having me search the internet none stop for answers.

I felt fine for the most part when I got the drug.  I knew I had a BV infection for almost a week prior to getting the gel and my symptoms weren't anything compared to this!  I also have horrible clumpy white discharge.  Ew!  I'm thinking I want to quit this medication but after the initial five days I'm to coninue treatment twice a week for two months.

410, 3, BV,Yeserday I completed my 5-day stint on Metrogel; so I'm not 100% if it's working yet.  I haven't experienced any odd discharge_ only the gel making it's way back out when I wake up in the morning.  Although_ I've been experiencng extreme inflammation_ burnng and itching.  I do recall having 2 moderate headaches in the past 5 days_ but I wasn't sure if they were associated with the medication.  Maybe they were_ since I usually never get headaches.,My doctor didn't mention many of the side effects you all are experiencing_ but when I told him that I noticed that I get this inflamed_ burning sensation about a week before each cycle he recommended that I change birth conrol pills.  Some pills can cause a spike in the acidity/bacteria in the vagina that causes BV. So I'm switching to another one-hopefully that'll help!,F,25,5  days,1/20/2009,Metrogel-vaginal
411, 4, Bacterial Vaginosis/BV,I just finished my fifth (last) prescribed dose of metrogel last night and this morning/afternoon I was shocked at the white_ cottage-cheese like discharge. I was worried that I had developed a yeast infection from the antibiotics (and am still slightly concerned). Other than the thick_ clumpy 'wet tissue paper' discharge I have had no side-effects but I was shocked at the discharge. This site makes me less anxious.,No problems but I wish that if this discharge IS a natural side effect that the manufacturers or my doctor had mentioned the possibility of it occurring. I was caught off guard (and it's still making me squeamish). BV symptoms (smell) cleared up about three days into using metrogel.,F,26,5  days,1/17/2009,Metrogel-vaginal

I finished my last dose on Sunday PM.  Took Diflucan on Monday...Today is Wednesday and I have seen more discharge than ever...I am hoping this is the end.  I was concerned about it until I came across this site.,I also experience vagianal dryness and stomach aches.  It wasn't too bad.  The most annoying thing is the discharge because I am not sure when it will be gone.  I've been avoiding the bf.

415, 1, bacterial vaginal infection,The first day or two headaches_ then small white clumps coming out of the vagina.  By day 5 had a lot of nausea and big white clumps.  Stopped taking after 5 days_ but clumps are still coming out and severe burning and irritation which makes me feel like I have to urinate all the time_ but my urine is clean - was tested and no infection or white blood cells.  The irritation is what is causing it.  The doctor removed some of the clumps.  Said this is common with metrogel and the medication does that.  Plus I have a sensitivity which caused the redness and irritation.,I would not use it again.,F,54,5  days,12/31/2008,Metrogel-vaginal
416, 3, BV,Mild nausea initially and then the white discharge everyone here has mentioned.,This is my very first BV and use of Metrogel.  I was diagnosed with BV after having two bouts of bleeding after sex with my husband.  My cervix was so inflammed that the swab to take a culture caused me to bleed.  Anyway_ I have taken 4 of the 5 nightly treatments.  I have not had any cramps to speak of or other side effects...just the extremely gross stringy/bloody/clumpy discharge with specks of brown.  I had the Mirena IUD placed in March of this year but my GYN said it was not the source of infection - - so_ is my husband of 8+ years infected??  Does he need to get checked?  When can I have sex again without worries of discharge_ odors_ etc.  The odor is gone (just a sweaty smell now with the pad)....can anyone tell me when this will be over???,F,33,4  days,12/22/2008,Metrogel-vaginal

I'm a SEVERELY clean girl (like_ bordering OCD_ lol) and this whole experience was too much for me. I only had symptoms of BV for 24 hours before running to the doctor for testing...panicky much ?That being said_ aside from a little stinging/general sense of ickiness immediately after inserting the medicine_ VERY slight headache_ and VERY slight nausea that went away quickly after eating graham crackers/toast...I have had no problem with the medication. I am on the 4th day now of a once a day insertion schedule...and the smell was completely gone within 12 hours of the first dose. I was incredibly scared to take Metro-Gel after originally reading this website (though I'm thoroughly glad it exists...It would have saved me from incredible panic if I had experienced any of the aforementioned side effects) but I have had nothing but a positive experience while using it.Side,Don't be scared ladies...just use the stuff.

The only drawback was the thick white stuff but I only saw that because I had sex (which I wasnt supposed to) but it didnt freak me out because I knew what it was. It never came out as a discharge during the day.  And rest assured that after your treatment is over...so are all the symptoms of the bacteria!

435, 4, Bacterial Vaginosis,Yes_ I got the white clumpy discharge_ but I gotta tell you...it was so much better than the BV symptoms themselves.  I was willing to deal with the clumpies just as long as that smell and that thin_ constant smelly discharge went away.  So to me_ it was a good_ temporary trade off.  I'm dealing with BV again_ and for some reason my doctor prescribed oral Metradonizole...and it has messed me up!  They gave me Clindamycin instead_ but I'm still dealing with the same side effects.  I'm dizzy as hell_ and it sucks!  I would love to go back to the metrogel!,,F,30,5  days,9/20/2008,Metrogel-vaginal

I was on a business trip too - what was I supposed to do!?!  Glad to hear this is at least sort of normal and I'm going to stick it out.

Thankfully!,Metro-gel worked somewhat. It is 5 days later and i still have some symptoms. most are gone but i can feel them returning. I used it for 5 days_ once a day. Am thinking that it might have done me good to use it for longer. I am still experiencing a white thick disharge but it is turning clearer than during use. Some burning has returned. itchy insideness. I have been dealing with it for almost 2 months! so_ i feel everyones pain.

445, 4, A diagnosis of BV found on a PAP,I didn't know I had BV. My doctor said it looked like I had a bacterial infection when she was doing the PAP smear. After using metrogel on the first night_ I experienced nausea. Bad nausea. I experienced this about an hour or so after taking it. It lasted until I fell asleep (I was taking it at night). On the 3rd day I decided to take Bonine about a half hour before I used the metrogel. This eliminated the nausea. If anyone else experiences nausea_ try taking Bonine first. Bonine makes you drowsy. However_ since I was using the Metrogel at night_ this wasn't a problem. Other than nausea_ I had no other unpleasant side effects.,I experienced the white clumpy discharge also. My doctor prescribed metrogel and diflucan at the same time. I dont know if this discharge was a yeast infection or not. It didn't seem like one to me_ but after I took the diflucan the clumpy discharge started to disapate. I took the diflucan the day after I stopped taking the metrogel. My doctor didn't say when I was supposed to take the diflucan_ so I dont know if I was supposed to take it at the same time.,F,29,4  days,4/4/2008,Metrogel-vaginal

I hope that this application doesn't cause any kind of yeast infection.  I'm on my last day and i still experience the white clumping and stringy discharge. When should this end?

At my 3 month check up for the IUD my gyno took a culture and caught the infection and was told me that it was possibly caused by the IUD and wrote me a script for the Metrogel-vaginal.  All I can say about this medication is it was a freakin nightmare!  The ""brown tissue substance"" that was comming out of my pooter was massive and I actually thought my insides were comming out!  After I was finished with the meds it went away.  Not only did I have the weird discharge but I also felt like my pooter was on fire.

455, 1, BV?,Gross_ glittery discharge at random times during the day.  Vulvodynia for the past 10 years.  Spasms (seizures?!) in upper thighs.  Pain.,I think this caused my vulvodynia!  I've been to too many doctors to count_ and still the burning doesn't go away.  My first problem occured from a traumatic sexual encounter and was mainly bladder pain.  After taking this and then having to take yeast meds_ I developed severe burning and weird discharge.  Doctors then decided I was having a reaction to the metrogel and yeast drugs!  The second time it was prescribed_ I woke up having tiny shakes in my upper legs and tingling in hands.  This scared me so much I refuse to take it ever again.  Use at your own risk.  I still don't think I ever had BV or if I did if it was something that needed medication.

It says to contact the doctor if we see this kind of discharge_ as if this is some kind of extreme side effect. But from what I can tell_ it isn't anything out of the ordinary. I'm glad to read this blog. It helps ease some of the anxiety. I'll contact my doctor tomorrow_ but for now_ I'm really glad it isn't as major as the literature made it sound.,F,28,4  days,12/22/2007,Metrogel-vaginal

I have never experience headaches from taking this medication(that I am aware of). I have never experienced bad cramping. I'd rather deal with symtoms such as a headache than an itcy vagina. For me the good out weighs the bad regarding this medication.

Dont worry_ its not a yeast infection..Eventually the metro gel white clumps will go away once your body has washed them out..Ladies_ your body and vagina has a way of cleaning its self out.. If the clumps bother you that much insert your finger and make a come hither motion and remove the whit clumps yourself..

Well_ most of the gel gets absorbed into the walls of your vagina but the excess comes out in your panties the next day (where else did you think it was going to go?) It actually tells you this in the pamphlet that comes WITH the prescription. It is in fine print (for those of you who read). Each yogurt and take acidophilus pills to prevent yeast infection.

I don't think it is a symptom of a yeast infection_ although I have had a yeast infection as a result of this treatment.  The discharge is grainy_ and shaped like a squiggly balled up tiny pieces of string.  Like many of the other posts_ I am troubled that this isn't mentioned in the literature that comes with the product.  I have experienced it twice and it seems quite common from the other posts.

465, 1, BV-Clue Cells,2nd degree burns of the vagina_ vulva_ passed out from the pain(10). Long term effects-Mast cells cause high sensativity and burning(2)_ even after three and half years,Doctors are not always quick to say it was the drug_ but I found one who told me what happened and what to do to help with pain after two months.  Corn Starch Douche worked wonders on the pain.  I would not ever use this drug again.  Doctor had given me Flaygl not knowing it is the same and it caused bladder burning pain(10) and severe uti burning(10).  The pain was so bad from the burning in the bladder all I could do was lay on the floor and beg God for help.  After 3 and half years I still sleep with ice between my legs because of the discomfort of the burning(2).  Sex is limited.  The clue cells of course came back_ now I use Aloe Vera_ directly from the leaf_ cooled in the refrigertor_ for 7 nights_ up in the vagina and it kills the clue cells and feels good when you feel burning.  I hope this information is beneficial.  I think womem should be made aware of the risk of being burnt_ not just have burning from this drug.

First I had bv and trich and I was put on the metro pill. I strated having a repiratory thing going on where my throat started to hurt so bad that I couldn't swallow my own spit (but she didn't think it was an allergic reaction because it happened day 3-4 or 7_ so don't let it bother you if you use the metro pill). They took me off the pill and I had to wait like a month to see the heath depot doctor. Finally they put me on the gel and gave me diflucan. The trich was gone but I had a yeast infection and BV. The discharge scared me so I looked up some stuff on it_ here is the website I found with the side effects that should be on the tube of metrogel http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=20208&name=METROGEL-VAGINALAnd for those of you who are still having a colored discharge try webmd.com.

By the 4th and 5th day the discharge turned into white color egg white looking with some red blobs. Very strange. It looked like an yeast infection_ but I had no itching.

I had no side effects while I was on metrogel other than the clumps_ but then 2 or 3 days after I finished_ it was like cayenne pepper was rubbed on my vagina. The burning and itching is a b***h. Its one week later and I'm still burning and itching. Seems like the only thing this gel is good for is getting rid of the smell.,I don't think I'll be takng this again_ though the smell is gone.

477, 4, BV,This is the fourth day i've been taking metro gel. My doctor directed me to only take it once a day though until gone_ at bedtime. The smell has reduced although occasionally i still sense the fishiness. After day two i got the white toilet paper slimey discharge everyone else has encountered and cannot stand it. I have decided to do the twice a day dosing because the time requirement would probablly be near 10 days to finish this tube. There is rarely itching now_ occasionally a very very mild burn when i go pee_ and very rare cramping. I really hope this goes away soon. Does anyone know how long the white clumpy stuff will come out after the medication is gone? also_ the discharge is just a side effect correct? i'm not getting a yeast infection?,,F,18,4  days,7/22/2007,Metrogel-vaginal

I examined it and it looked like clumpy white flesh_ with blood in between.  Nowhere in the side-effects did it mention anything like this so i thought my vagina and uterus are falling out!! :-) Decided to read on the internet - Thank God this website made me realise that other women have also experienced this side-effect.

482, 5, BV,White toilet-paper like flecks in vagina,"THIS ADVICE MIGHT HELP SOME WITH SIDE-EFFECTS: I am using Miphil (which is the Metrogel equivalent in Italy).  I had milky white_ thin (like skimmed milk) secretions from my vagina that always left my underwear wet and my lower area!  No smell_ but a little redness and a tiny bit of buring when I urinated.  In the morning I would have more wetness/whiteness down below.  My gyno suggested the following_ Use Miphil (Metrogel) once every 3 days (for a month) and every morning douche with ""Edenil 0_1g by Zambon"".  Edenil helps restore the natural PH of your vagina_ while Miphil kills all bacteria (good and bad).  Douching with Edenil also helps flush out the white toilet-paper like flecks.  I also take a lactobaacilllus (fermenti lattici= Enterolactis) in water every morning to help restore the good bacteria (natural flora) in my intestine and eventually my vagina.

It does take at least one week for the clumps to fully go away and my husband won't touch me until they are gone_ understandably.,I started taking Acidophilus to help keep my flora at a good level and I can honestly say it has worked. I don't like fruit that much_ and I don't eat the best as many of us do_ but the Acidophilus (one a day) seems to really keep the BV away.  I've only had it once in the past 2 years and it was my own doing because of really bad food and eating habbits and not taking the Acidophilus for more than a month.  I used to get BV and the Metrogel didn't even work on one treatment until I started taking the pills.  Imagine taking 10 days of Metrogel.  Acidophilus is worth taking every day.  I take ON777 every day already anyhow.  What's one more.,F,36,5  years,5/5/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
485, 5, BV,I have never had BV before and was very worried about using this gel after reading about some of the awful side effects. I am generally very sensitive to medications and was afraid of developing a yeast infection or worse. Yesterday was my last dose and so far_ I haven't had any negative side effects.,I made an effort to eat yogurt with active cultures every day during my treatment and also took a homeopathic pill to prevent yeast infections. I am not sure if that is why I did not develop an infection_ but I am sure it can't hurt. Does anyone know when you can start to have sex after the treatment or know how to get all the cream out_ or does it all just come out on it's own? Thanks!,F,26,5  days,5/5/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
486, 2, possible infection,Massive_ White_ clumpy discharge that began two days after LAST dose.After another poster sugested it_ I took out my nuva ring and was horrified at the clumps on it. GROSS! My doctor had me use this TWICE a day for five days_ isnt that too much?!,All these posts but no clear answer to the question:Is the white clumps a yeast infection (I have no itching or smell) or will it go away on its own after being off metro gel for a few days? How long will this last? Does it need to be treated? PLEASE EMAIL ME with answer!!!,F,30,5  days,4/24/2007Email,Metrogel-vaginal
487, 4, BV,"clear/""slimey"" discharge_ which is normal_ just the medicine coming back out... only worries were flecks of brown  which i read in others comments_ i assume a lil blood? and today is day 4 and the applicator had bright red blood on it after i gave myself the medicine. i'm not due for a period til 1 1/2 weeks... so i dont know what the blood is about. feel tired_ a bit nauseous. YOU SHOULD NOT DRINK on this med... it says so CLEARLY on the package. also NO SEX until after the course is finished. it also is printed on the package.",i've used this before and it works_ but the bleeding is a new side affect.,F,29,4  days,4/10/2007,Metrogel-vaginal

490, 1, BV,Thank God for this website! I thought a was gonna die! I got so scared when I saw this terrible disscharge. The first few days I just had the white toilet paper-like discharge on the 3rd and 4th day it was brown and red almost looking like pieces of flesh coming out-SCARRY! Is there going to be anything left of my reproductive system after this medicine?? I'm having terrible cramps also_ like really bad-a lot worst than a period. I still have one more dose and not sure if I should take it or not_ I want the BV to go away but afraid it's doing something even more terrible to my insides.,Can not believe it's not mentioned in side effects or by the OBGYN. Crazy! People can really have a heart attack from seeing this stuff! Any advice anyone? should I take the last dose or not? It's a sunday too-so I can't call the doc to find out.,F,25,4  days,3/18/2007Email,Metrogel-vaginal

492, 3, bv,none yet,I am brand new to this medication. Im on day 1 and I didnt get an applicator with my prescription. I am nervous because on the tube it says for external use only and doesnt refer say anything about dosage. (My doc was out today when I called for my prescription_ the doc there called this in for me). Can anyone tell me about how much to use and that this 1% gel for roatia is the same for my bv??  Thanks so much!! I am lost with this stuff!!,F,34,1  days,3/6/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
493, 1, BV,The gel goes in clear and comes out looking like Bama Red Plum Jam!  What is that about?,The week following the five day treatment_ I spotted all week.  The week after that I have had a seven day period that appears to never end.  I flooded three times to day!  With what?  I think I'm about out of blood!  I didn't know I had a BV.  No symptoms.  Same heterosexual relationship for two years.  Oh_ I think this stuff is extremely hormonal!  Breasts are sore like when I first found out I was pregnant (that was years ago)...and I told somebody off today!  yikes...,F,44,5  days,3/6/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
494, 4, BV,I had this terrible itch and a smelly discharge went to the my gyn and was told I had bv give metro gel in a pill form and one pill for yeast infection and some cream. Today was the first day I notice the thick discharge and when I found out it's was a normal side effect_ I was relieve.  Also my partner had to use the cream because he was irritrate as well.,My question to anyone when can I resume sexual relation? Also what is the risk of this coming back if we do not use a condom. This is my first time ever having a BV. Help anyone.,F,35,3  days,2/28/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
495, 1, BV,i had aboustouly no symptoms or probelm i went in for my yearly exam and he put me on this i feel he had no clue what he was talking about about and i felt funny using it but figured i should in case there really was somthing wrong. he told me to use it for 5 day but by the second day i was in such horrible pain i cant belive i used it the thrid day i skipped the fouth and when i woke i was bleeding worse than any period id ever had. i had the white clumps on day one but i figured it was the medicine coming back out. i felt worn out and irritable i felt and i wanted to rip out my uterus and overaies.,to have had no problems prior to metro gel i see no reason why he put me on it this has been one of the worse exprinces of my life and wouldnt recomened this to anyone who didnt feel they aboustly needed it.  i just went off it two days ago and i feel as though it my have caused more probelms than anything.,F,19,3  days,2/26/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
496, 4, BV,slight headache,Makers should definitely insert some kind of 'disclaimer' or side effect about the clumpy white discharge.  I experienced this in the end and after having taken the 5 day dosage of MetroGel.  I've only been off the medication for about 2 days and i wasn't aware of how much discharge there actually was until intercourse (and theres quite a bit)_ where my partner and I kind of sat there puzzled as to what all this white lumpy stuff was.. haha.. finding this site was a great help and now know that it will all clear up.. so no worries_ you're okay.. so far i think i am :),F,23,5  days,2/20/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
497, 1, BV,Bad_ painful stomach cramps.  Tired.  Feverish.  Worried.,I didn't realize that a medicine inserted into the vagina could make me feel so bad all over.  I feel like I have the flu.  I stopped on day 4 and can't continue.  I feel miserable.,F,41,4  days,2/12/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
498, 5, BV,slight headache. other than that_ NONE whatsoever.,this medicine worked for me. i much prefer this to having to put up with an oral antibiotic. i was getting recurrent infections_ because my partner is not circumsized_ so those of you who keep getting it may want to consider that as a possibility of why. guys can be treated for it with a medication called Flagyl. oh_ and has it EVER occured to anyone that the white clumpy discharge could just be the medicine killing the infection and then letting gravity take its course????!!! i've gotten it each time with this medicine. AND THAT'S ALL THAT DISCHARGE IS - IT'S THE MEDICINE.,F,26,5  days,2/11/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
499, 4, BV,"I had very few side effects_ just some mild cramping for the first day or two. Nothing even worth taking pain meds for...HOWEVER_ what I didn't know was_ after the course of treatment is done_ that this white_ clumpy_ cottage cheese looking discharge starts. I was FREAKING OUT because I thought I had some sort of other infection. Little did I know_ this is normal_ albeit unpleasant. My doctor put it well_ ""What goes in must come out"" Yeah_ I get it_ but I wish i'd known that ahead of time so as not to freak out about it!",This is the 2nd time I've had BV in 5 months...I've never had this before and was wondering if this is something that will keep happening? I've been married for over 2 years and we're monogamous_ so it's not like I have multiple partners or anything? Does anyone get this regularly? And if so_ how can I prevent it? Please respond if you have have any suggestions or tips!!!!,F,27,5  days,2/8/2007Email,Metrogel-vaginal
500, 3, BV,I'm on the second day and I have the strange papery discharge_ with  a few flecks of brown. Ick. I'm hoping this doesn't mean yeast infection_ as I've noticed other people have said. I'm also hoping this will take care of the problem and not lead to any others.Also_ my gynecologist didn't mention anything about not having sexual intercourse while using this treatment_ but I would assume that would be a no-no? (And with the nasty discharge_ I wouldn't want to subject my boyfriend to that.),,F,20,4  days,2/8/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
501, 4, BV,I'm on my 2nd day and am exhausted_ not to mention that I've had a lingering headache all day. I woke up with a little bit of nausea too this morning.,I haven't experience the cottage cheese discharge yet_ so maybe I'm lucky. I will eat some yogurt though to try and prevent the yeast infection. My only complaint about the applicator is that I wish it had a rounded tip_ like a tampon. I feel like the round opening is kind of rigid and makes it hard to insert.,F,28,5  days,1/30/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
502, 3, BV,It made my vaginal skin a little itchy and irritated...I hope this is just the gel and that my infection is indead gone.  My doc looked under the microscope and said I looked better.  I did not experience the white toilet paper discharge everyone is talking about.  The gel just came out and looked exactly as it did when I put it in.,,F,24,5  days,1/28/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
503, 4, BV,I had previously posted about the white discharge I experienced. I just wanted to update that the discharge went away after two days of stopping the medicine. The BV is gone_ still battling a minor yeast infection.,It cured the BV_ but the discharge was disgusting.,F,28,5  days,1/25/2007,Metrogel-vaginal

505, 4, BV,Thick_ clumpy mostly white discharge. It is very gross and freaked me out! I am prone to yeast infections_ but knew this wasn't one...and it was BV. The dr said the gel worked better than the pill...wish I would have insisted upon the pill. I called my dr this morning after I noticed the discharge and she just said it was a yeast infection and gave me one dose of diflucan. I have had many yeast infections and never have had this discharge before! I hope it goes away after the medicine is done. I still have three more doses.,I am also experiencing dryness and irritation. The discharge is by far the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. Happy to see I'm not the only one with these symptoms.,,28,5  days,1/20/2007,Metrogel-vaginal
506, 5, BV,I ALSO EXPEERIENCED COTTAGE CHEESE CRAP COMIG OUT ON THE 2ND. DAY_ SO I GOT ONLINE TO FIND OUT WHATS GOING ON. IT IS SO DICUSTING_ BUT OVER ALL I WOULD RATHER GO THREW THIS STAGE THAN TO WALK AROUND SMELLING BAD. THE COTTAGE CHEESE DONT HAVE A SMELL. AS FAR AS THE BV AROUND THE SECOND DAY METRO SEEMS TO BE WORKING. I AM SO GLAD THERE IS A WEB SITE LIKE THIS. WE ALL CAN TALK ABOUT THE VAGINAL STUFF.,I ALSO FEEL DRAINED WITH THIS MEDICATION. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. MY MOUTH IS DRY A LOT. TASTE BUDS ARE 1/2 THERE. A HAMBURGER TASTES GOOD_ BUT WITH THE MEDICATION I CANT REALLY TASTE THE FLAVOR. ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS SYMPTOM? I'M ON DAY 3. 4 MORE DAYS AND I'LL BE DONE. HOW EVER THIS METRO DOES ITS JOB. (GET RID OF BV),F,27,7  days,1/17/2007Email,Metrogel-vaginal

I was having the worst bladder pain and vaginal pain! They tested me again and said I had BV.They put me on Flagyl at first but it gave me the worst anxiety!!! DON""T take that stuff!Now Iam on Metrogel. Nurse told me it wouldn't cause a Yeast Infection but....I don't think she knows her ass from her foot!I am on the 4th day of treatment and still have mild pain.

I AM POSTMENOPAUSAL (60 YRS OLD).  HAD WHITE CLUMPY DISCHARGE AFTER TWO DAYS OF STOPPING METROGEL. ASKED OB/GYN NURSE IF THIS COULD CAUSE A YEAST INFECTION.  ANSWER WAS DEFINITELY YES SO I ASKED FOR A SCRIPT FOR DIFLUCAN AND HAVE STARTED THE DIFLUCAN 3 DAYS AFTER STOPPING METROGEL. STILL HAVE VAGINAL BURNING.

509, 5, BV during pregnancy,I had the cottage cheese/wet toilet paper stuff after 2 days of metrogel too!! I searched and searched for side effects of metrogel and found nothing. Then I thought its an antibiotic so it must be causing a yeast infection? So I was soooo relieved when I see that others have it too.,The cheesy stuff has absolutely no smell and the foul smell from the BV went away after the second day so overall I give it a 5. I am pregnant so my doctor instructed me to only take for 3-4 days.,F,26,4  days,12/23/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
510, 4, BV,Not sure,I'm confused.... I don't have white clumps like everyone else is describing... it really just seems like the ORIGINAL problem (BV) I had is much MUCH less than before. In other words_ still have a slight discharge_ but it doesn't smell at all. The discharge is still brown-ish_ but I still have to wear a pantyliner! I figure I can just continue taking Metrogel until I see 100% results_ no?,F,25,6  days,12/19/2006,Metrogel-vaginal

Doc told me to due 3 more days help,I really don't know about this med. Should I call the doc back and try an oral?

512, 1, Was prescribed for BV.,My original symptoms were soreness w/o discharge or odor.  I was prescribed metrogel.  This is the third time I have taken it and this time was as bad as ever.  The last two times I stopped thinking that I had the worst yeast infection ever.  Immediately after treatment I get extreme itching_ redness_ and irritation_ plus the lovely toilet paper clumpys that are beyond digusting.  I have one more dose and I don't want to do it.  I am so uncomfortable and I hate the clumpy's.  It is just not right.  Last time_ once I made it through the five days_ I was much better after two days off of metro-gel but the treatment process was horrible.,You've got to wonder about a medication that has so many side effects that are not included in the product instructions.  Makes me wonder how well tested this drug is.,F,31,5  days,12/11/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
513, 5, Bacterial Vaginosis,My eye is twitching but that could totally be non-related. had a mild like_ psuedo headache. nothing bad.,EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THESE WHITE CLUMPY DISCHARGE AFTER A FEW DAYS ON METROGEL.THIS IS A YEAST INFECTION!!!! lol. CAUSED BY THE ANTIBIOTICS USED TO KILL THE BAD BACTERIA. METROGEL WILL KILL ALL BACTERIA IN YOUR VAGINA. SOME BACTERIA IS NEEDED TO KEEP YEAST UNDER CONTROL. NO BACTERIA=YEAST OVERGROWTH=YEAST INFECTION.MY GYNO IS SMART_ AND TO CURB THIS_ GAVE ME TWO DIFLUCAN TABS. ONE TAB I TOOK ON DAY TWO OF METROGEL AND THUS DIDN'T DEVELOP A YEAST INFECTION. SHE SAID IF I DID_ BY THE END OF THE USE_ TO TAKE THE OTHER DIFLUCAN IF NEEDED.NO PROBLEMS OTHERWISE.I USED CLEOCIN LAST TIME I HAD BV AND DEVELOPED THE WORST YEAST INFECTION I'VE EVER HAD. SINCE I AM PRONE TO YEAST AFTER ANTIBIOTIC USE_ WE COMBAT THAT BEFORE HAND BY FIGHTING YEAST DURING MEDICATING THE BV!!!GOOD LUCK & DON'T FREAK OUT!

514, 5, Bacterial Vaginosis,Mild Headache on days 1-2_ and then raging yeast infection on day 5.(that white discharge everyone speaks of is yeast_ since the M/G kills the bacteria that keeps the yeast in check),Had to get monistat and started that as soon as i finished the metro-gel. The yeast infection didn't go away all the way_ so I was prescriped DIFLUCAN. Took the yeast away_ the BV was gone thanks to the METROGEL...and my vagina is back in tune!!,F,27,7  days,12/10/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
515, 5, BV,Slimy discharge with large wet yellowish paper-like clumps.,I have used this product in the past and have never experienced anything like this. My doctor did not for warn me that I could have these kind of results. I do feel a little nauseated at times. The smell was gone on day 2_ but the discharge started.  Thank God for this website.  I thought something was HORRIBLY wrong.  The manufacturer should enclose these possible side-effects with this product. By the way_ you CAN be REINFECTED from your partner. Do a little more research and check with your local health dept. Always remember_ if you are not getting the answers you need from your current doctor or the results_ change to another one. This is your body and you must take care of it.,F,33,4  days,12/9/2006,Metrogel-vaginal

(dark red-brown)which is why i freaked out when it came out. i dont know if its helped yet because i still have tonight before im done. we'll see.,,F,21,5  days,12/4/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
518, 5, BV,I too was completely freaked out by this clear/white flesh like toilet paperish mucous clumps. Oh my god... what was this! For days I searched afraid of what I was going to find out. I finished the 5 day doses 2 days ago. The clummpy discharge started_ about 3 days into the treatment. My period started today and I still have the clumps :o(. How long does this last... the clumps? Thank you sisters... I can breathe a little easier!!,I just wish that the manufactor and the doctors/ pharmacists would deem this important enough to let us know of the possible side effects. I think I will look further into this.,F,42,5  days,11/24/2006Email,Metrogel-vaginal

The smell goes away immediatly thank god_ then for the next couple of days I have the clumps from hell! Then they go and Its back to normal for a few weeks.,I worry that I have something other than BV. If I had an std or hpv would the gel work like it does for me now or would my symptoms never go away in that case?? I wonder if my husband isn't giving it back to me when we have sex after its gone. I'm very scared and imbarassed! I wish I could just be normal! I feel so gross!,F,24,2  weeks,11/22/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
520, 3, BV,For the first two days of taking metrogel i noticed a relief in the severity of symptoms_ there is still a lingering mild burn and itching_this is the second time i have used this product and it seems to almost clear symptoms but not quite. I also panicked this morning when i had a larg rubbery white discharge but was relieved upon reading this. I also think it is important that people no NOT to smoke MARIJUANA while taking this medicine i had a very severe mental reaction and felt psychotic almost went to the hospital. I also thought I should share that on the metrogel pamphlet it says other STD possibilities should be eliminated so if it is possible u have one u should get checked out as i am doing thanks for all the comments i feel very relieved,,F,19,5  days,11/8/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
521, 3, BI,First I started out with symptoms that I had a yeast infection. When suddenly my symptoms got worst and my vagina felt raw_ itchy and very sensitive. I went to gyno_ i'm having some tests run which i'm getting tomorrow_ but she prescribed metrogel for the time being. So far i've noticed the smell less than before. But the itching and burning and raw feel feels worst and yesterday was my last dosage. IT SUCKS!,So far I haven't experienced any weird cottage cheese/toilet paper symptoms. I hope I don't get that!

522, 5, BV,"I_ too_ had teaspoon-size clumps of discharge like wet toilet paper (also like ""Cream of Wheat"") with flecks of dark brown tissue on roughly days 5_ 7_ 8_ and 9.",Besides the worry of a bad infection_ I had an even worse worry. I went to see my gyn about it_ and as soon as the speculum was inserted_ started to bleed a lot. I had told her on the 1st visit that we had just started trying to get pregnant_ so_ I guess based on my earlier description of the discharge_ she thought I was having a miscarriage. So I lay there with blood dripping on the floor in fear of miscarrying_ then had to cram a pad in my underwear_ then rush off to have a blood test before they closed to see if I tested positive for hcg (the pregnancy hormone). I had to wait all of today for her call_ which never came_ so I called myself. It was negative_ so no pregnancy_ no miscarriage; my period had come a bit early. The one good thing is that I am changing doctors. I felt like she hadn't listened to my description of the discharge_ that I had to try to convince her what it really was like. Granted_ it's a crazy description. But had she listened_ she may have realized it was NORM,F,39,5  days,10/13/2006,Metrogel-vaginal

524, 5, BV,I was diagnosed with BV and the doctor prescribed metrogel to me. In two days my BV symptoms (i.e. fishy smell_ discharge) were gone. However in that same two days I started getting the same clumpy discharge that a lot of other people have described. I'm supposed to use the gel for 7 days total_ so I hope in two more days when I'm finished with it_ it will go away! Also... DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL while taking this drug!! I made that mistake and I became EXTREMELY nauseous_ and vomited a lot the next morning. I know I did not drink enough to cause this_ so I'm pretty sure the mixing of the two drugs caused it. I also experience a strange_ almost metallic taste in my mouth. However_ I think it is curing my BV.

528, 1, BV,I had nausea_ fatigue_ cramping and severe vaginal bleeding.  I ended up in the ER twice in one week due to what I believed to be hemorraging.  I had tests performed including_ blood and urine_ ultrasound and vaginal ultrasound. Two weeks ago I went in for a cervical and uterine biopsy.  The Dr.'s were all baffled and have all told me that all is fine. I have been placed on birth control pills for the next three months to control the abnormal bleeding despite NEVER having bleeding between periods. All this due to Metrogel? I'm grateful to have found this site especially since I just started another dose last night. I won't continue with the treatment.

Well I had to go back to the dr for a upper respiratory thing and got more antibiotics and my bv came back. So I got back on metrogel and now have a yeast infection from the metrogel. So now I am taking a yeast treatment. I had the weird discharge but not as bad as some on this message board.,I think metrogel should list the discharge as a side effect on the instructions because it is very scary. Also if you take on your cycle it makes your period weird almost like sand. I hope I don't have a bv again. I am going in next week for a rechek to make sure its cleared up.,M,30,5  days,8/1/2006Email,Metrogel-vaginal
533, 5, BV,Clear discharge with wet toilet paper like clumps_ gross!  Little tired and some cramping.,I am so happy that the crazy toilet paper discgarge is normal.  I took MetroGel one other time for Trich 8 years ago_ and i remember some crazy weird discharge back then_ but not like this.. It was more slippery clear (God_ what we must endure for the Vagina!),F,35,5  days,7/28/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
534, 5, BV,Sorry_ my post is below.. forgot to add the I also have a dark brown (assume blood) discharge too.. and yes it seems crazy they would not include the side affects common to all of us who posted here on the pamphlet.  I too was about to call the Doc to make sure it was normal.  She said I probably shouldn't have sex while on the medicine_ duh!  They should say absolutely not!  I am glad I checked down there before deciding to try!,This is a great Medicine and worth the pain....,F,35,5  days,7/28/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
535, 3, BV,white discharge_ yeast infection_ abdominal pain.,I got BV after having nonsurgical abortion.I've took 3 courses of this drug_ it comes back all the time_ I try to explain my doctor that I probably need a longer treatment_ but he even doesn't want to listen to me_ says 2 weeks and that's it_ I think sometimes you need much longer treatment. I am going to take combination of metronidazole cream and pills for 2 months. I really want to get rid of it_ and do not want to have any complications in the future_ which are way to serious. Also I read that Clindamycin (Cleocin) is more effective for BV. I want to try it_ too.,F,21,2  weeks,7/27/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
536, 3, VB,I drink so I was nauseous as hell.,I used the Metrogel_ then did the Monistat (I guess from what I read here which has been great to hear others experiencing the same since I thought my cooch was rotting or something).  Anyway how the heck do you know when it's gone?  I did the metro gel the previous week_ then the monistat last week_ I'm still yellowishy texturized discharging.  When do you know its gone & would you say this is normal to experience stuff for a little while after you've taken the meds?,F,30,5  days,7/24/2006Email,Metrogel-vaginal
537, 5, BV,"Numbness and tingling in the limbs/extremities_ aka ""peripheral neuritis_"" after just ONE night on VAGINAL metrogel. Dr said it was probably a ""fluke""; took it second night_ and had even worse numbness_ and an intense headache at the top of my spine; neither has gone away in almost a week after discontinuation.","I just put a ""5"" down so people would not have to scroll down to find this comment buried; I'd actually give it less than a 1. DON'T USE THIS DRUG if you've EVER had carpal tunnel or ANY prolonged numbness/tingling in your limbs_ and/or if you have diabetes_ fibromyalgia or autoimmune disease_ which are related to peripheral neuritis. The packaging just said not to use in the case of central nervous system disease_ but given that peripheral neuritis is associated with autoimmune disease_ that seems terribly irresponsible. My experience shows that even the supposedly safer vaginal form can cause these VERY SERIOUS side effects. It's not worth the risk. There is an alternative: oral or vaginal clindamycin.",F,37,2  days,7/21/2006,Metrogel-vaginal

539, 1, BV,I went to the doc bc I had tons of pain during sex--  She gave me metrogel ... on my 2nd night I was soooo sick--- couldnt get out of bed- I ended up sleeping next to the toilet bc I thought I would throw up all night.  I am done with the meds now- on day 2... and just had sex-- major bleeding!  MAJOR pain... like crazy pain!  I am sooooo mad.,My doc also said I would get a yeast infection- and gave me a 1 day pill...    I am serious.  Sex hurts worse than anything I have ever felt!!!!!!!!!  beware~,F,21,5  days,7/9/2006,Metrogel-vaginal

541, 5, BV,I've had BV off and on for the past 2 years...every 3 or 4 months I seem to get it. I'm supposed to take the gel once a night for 10 days (which I've done)_ and then twice a week for 3 months. I'm experiencing the clearish/thick discharge that looks like wet toilet paper in the toilet...and just the other day a huge clump of white lumpy discharge fell out also.  I figured that was the start of a yeast infection maybe.,I asked my gyno if maybe my partner has it and keeps passing it back to me after I'm cured from it_ but she says it isn't passed from partner to partner.,F,24,10  days,7/5/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
542, 2, BV,Thick white clumpy discharge that looks like tissue_ which sometimes was pinkish or reddish. Scared the heck out of me! Glad I found this board! Was ready to run to my OBGYN thinking I might have a massive fungal infection inside of me! My vulva and surrounding areas are dry and irritated and raw. Burning.Have tried this gel previously and this is the first time I am having this scary set of side effects. I read somewhere that it is because of sloughing/erosion of the vaginal cells. I wonder if that is a good thing?! It's really painful and scary.,Side effects should be better described. OBGYNS need to tell their patients about these side effects_ or they are going to lose a lot of patients who died of heart attacks seeing this discharge!,F,30,4  days,7/3/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
543, 4, Bacterial vaginosis,Has the same clumpy white discarge that mostly everyone else experienced within a couple of days.  Was only on it for five days. It got rid of the fishy smell and I think the bacterial infection is gone.  However_ I have had pains in my lower abdomin_ uterus_ ovaries_ and pelvic region since 2 days after using it!!!! It has now been about 5 weeks since I have used it.  I am still having these pains.  I went to my gyno twice since then_ got tested twice for any possible std's and all were negative.  Also did an ultrasound to check for cysts.  Everything is normal.  Has anybody else been experiencing these pains for such a long time after taking this medication?,Please would like to know!!  My gyno said he doesn't know what's going on and that everything looks fine.  I am seriously freaking out!,F,22,5  days,6/23/2006Email,Metrogel-vaginal
544, 4, BV,Clumpy white discharge_ slight abdominal pain_ fatigue,"I ALSO have the clumpy discharge and I agree that it needs to be listed in the side effects because it freaks a person out.  I was pissed at my doctor because I was afraid of getting a yeast infection_ that's why she gave me the gel instead of the pill_ but after reading this_ I feel better.  I also want to know more about the interaction with alcohol.  I am not going to drink during my five days on it and the additional three_ like it says_ so hopefully I don't have any ""psychotic episodes"" when I do have a drink.  I am glad to be rid of the smell_ hopefully I won't have recurring infections.  So far I am satisfied_ we'll see how I am doing in another week.",F,28,4  days,6/13/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
545, 4, BV,I experienced the same as everyone else - the white_ clumpy cottage cheese like discharge that had me thinking I had a HORRIBLE yeast infection or an STI - thank god I found this website and now I can sleep!  I first noticed it after the 1st night of taking it but today I took out my NuvaRing (which you all should try if you haven't!!!) and the stuff came out in huger clumps (like table spoon sized)  Also_ if you've had BV my gynocologist was saying it can come back so you might need to take a shot of this stuff once a week - you should ask your doctors about this,,F,24,4  days,6/12/2006,Metrogel-vaginal
546, 3, Bacterial Infection,I just feel weird. My vaginal area is very dry and I feel discomfort in my lower abdomen all the time. Kind of feels like I have to poop_ but all the time. It's weird but it makes me feel better to just sit on the toilet_ even when I don't have to poop. But of course I can't do this at work all day now can I? I just feel irritated. I want to go home and lay down.,Today is my first day on Metrogel. I think I'm going to finish it. Today is 6/8/06.,F,26,5  days,6/8/2006Email,Metrogel-vaginal

548, 1, Bacterial Vaginosis during pregnanc,I am prone to side effects from medicaiton but this was just insane.  I am 23 weeks pregnant and was prescribed this aweful medication for a bacterial infection I actually never had and within hours had constant painful contractions for two days and was laying in bed exhausted_ contracting with a headache I thought was going to turn into a migraine(thankfully it didn't.)  I couldn't eat because I felt so sick to my stomach and everything I did manage to choke down went straight through me.  Then along came the white cottage chesse/wet toilet paper discharge which is just horrible especially when you're pregnant and already have weird discharge!,"I truly did fear for my babies life while taking this medication and was very disturbed to find out that the doctor(and her nurse) had no idea that any of these side effects I experienced were typical of this medication_ which they obviously are.  Thankfully my baby is hearty and I seem to have suffered no ill effects from my terrible experience I want to warn any prengnant woman away from taking this medication and although the doctor will tell you that a bacterial infection ""down there"" can lead to pre-term labor_ don't believe it unless you've already had a pre-term labor with an earlier baby.  There is so little evidence to back up this pre-term labor theory it's almost amusing.  But the doctors need something to panic us pregnant women about.  So_ please_if you are pregnant don't take this stuff.  I don't want to ever read again that a woman miscarried because of this medication.  Honestly_ mother nature can take care of us a lot better given a little time.  Also_ try dr",F,31,2  days,5/31/2006,Metrogel-vaginal

My discharge is finally drying up.  I'm also taking Rephresh which claims to maintain the proper ph level in the body.  It's worth taking a look at.

I must have had a herat attack lyin on that bed looking in the mirror down there. Ther was this white chunky stuff that scsared the life out of my for a few seconds.

I didn't have any odor at all_ but have always had excess discharge normally_ and being pregnant_ I've heard that it only gets worse_ so didn't think anything of it.  I was given MetroGel and told that I would have ""mucous-like"" discharge after the first few days_ but instead of anything slimy_ I got a tablespoon-sized clump of white_ chunky cottage cheese stuff come out of me after the 4th day during sex (with a condom--the doc said I could have sex_ but needed to wait until the end of the dosage time).  It's still coming out_ but I'm glad to know that it's the medicine_ and not just me with a raging infection.  Whew!","The doc just told me to finish the tube instead of taking the normal 5-day dose.  I have about 1 more syringe-full left_ and tonight will be my 11th night_ just in case anyone is curious.  Thanks to whoever it is for the tip about eating yogurt regularly (with Acidophilus) or taking a supplement to promote the ""good"" healthy bacterial growth since MetroGel kills both the good and the bad bacteria.  Also_ thanks for the tip about using a condom for a month afterwards so your vagina can repopulate her bacteria better_ since having sex without a condom can cause BV.  :)",F,23,10  days,4/7/2006,Metrogel-vaginal

554, 4, BV,Im just finished my metrogel about 2 days ago. I had these chunks that range from gray to white to pink_ they look like wet toilet paper. I'm so glad I found this site. I thought something was SERIOUSLY wrong with me_ cause it looks like I'm shedding tissue or something. Im glad I'm not the only one that has experienced this.,The metrogel worked well. i noticed douching helps with the wet toilet paper thing.

I'm on hormone replacement meds and don't normally have periods or bleeding. I was concerned because this discharge was pink_ redish and brown.  This is also the second time in the last 6 months i've used metrogel and didn't have any of these symptoms last time.  Thank you all for taking the time to share because I was ready to call the MD thinking something was really wrong with the yucky discharge. It seems to be pretty common.

None of the patient information states that it is a white rubbery discharge_ which would have been helpful seeing that I thought I had a Wisconsin dairy working in my vagina.

559, 1, BV  First Tri Pregnancy/Miscarriage,Clumpy_ tissuey_ bloody discharge.  Severe cramping to the point of doubling over_ itching_ burning_ tightness,I started taking this drug after my first pregnancy appointment.  My doctor said that it was safe to use. I used it for only five days and then started miscarrying.  I attributed it to stress.  I had some left over and got another BV infection 8 mos later.  I started to use it again.  Severe cramping appeared within the first two days and then my period came on almost 7 days early.  Now after carefully reading the package and this website_ I am starting to wonder if MetroGel caused me to lose my baby.  This product was never tested on humans and the pregnant mice that it was tested on_ interuterine deaths did occur.

560, 4, BV,very intense cramping through the entire 5 days.  More tired than usual and 3 days after the treatment ended_ still noticing this problem.  Towards day 4 of treatment_ I started noticing the wierd toilet paper_ rubbery white discharge.   Some of it has red streaks? spots? that look like sloughing.  the discharge has shown no signs of slowing down.  Very distressing and certainly not a normal side effect.  Especially since I had researched this thoroughly before starting treatment.,I will be contacting 3M to complain about this.  The  most common side effect (12%) is this disgusting discharge.  That's quite a bit_ and the least they could do is be more specific.  Esspeiclaly since clumpy white discharge that isn't yeast is a sign of cervical or uterine cancer.  No need to scare patients when a little information would help set the mind at ease.,F,37,5  days,3/4/2006,Metrogel-vaginal

Also I did have some intense burning and itching_ but that is getting better as the days go on.,Smell was gone within the 1st day_ which was a relief b/c I didnt know I had a condition_ and just thought that I had a naturally bad odor.

Normally I cramp for 1 day but I started the gel (figure lets just get the mess over with and phamiscist said it was ok) Got AGONIZING cramps (normal for me on day 1) that are continuing (NOT NORMAL).

I had the BV 2 weeks b4 the gel and didnt feel anything close to this miserable!) before ! Still wanting the hideous kicked in the stomach cramps to go away and its NOT DUE TO MY PERIOD I CAN ASSURE YOU! Phamisist did warn me that by taking this stuff its pretty much no holds barred that you WILL get a yeast infection (as this metro is an antibiotic) and to follow it with some Yeast cream etc.  Sorry kids_ Im eating yogurt and being nicer to my tata (no fabric softner_ gentle soap and diet) but Im NOT USING this gel AGAIN-Ugh!

I burned and itched and it hurt to wipe myself after urinatiing.,My doctor never told me anything not even the cause.  She said use this for five days and you should be fine so when I saw the stuff coming out of me I freaked out!  I had no idea what it was.

572, 4, BV 5 months pregnant,"I thought I had a Yeast Infection at first until my OB visit where she confirmed it was BV. I was afraid to use the drug with my pregnancy but_ because I was so miserable and feared going into pre-term labor (BV can cause this) I used the drug. The first night_ the itching got worse than before_ I had mild burning and I had some pinkish discharge the next day. My doc said this was due to the applicator rubbing against the vaginal wall and tearing away some of the already sensitive tissue due to the infection. The second night I began having the ""wet toilet paper"" discharge and until this rating board (thank goodness)I thought it was just that-- wet toilet paper. I will be taking my second to last dose tonight. I no longer have any cramping_ lower back pain or flank pain and I think it is working. I am worried about my baby but God-willing it will all be okay. I will be contacting MetroGel and ask them to add the side-effects to the leaflet.

576, 2, Bacterial Vaginal Infection,Lumpy discharge that was gel-like (like the medication) but it had some creamy white coloring to it. Within 2 days_ I saw bit of pink fleshy looking stuff in with that discharge. Around that same timeframe_ I developed painful abdominal cramps_ diarreha_nausea_ and chills (like a flue). I am not sure if it's related_ but after reading this I am more suspicious. I stopped taking the medication after the third dose because it was scared. I am still nausious_ few cramps_ but the discharge has no more pink - 3 days after discontinuing use.,I will probably call the docter today and find out if this was all related. I don't feel comfortable useing this drug again.,F,28,5  days,11/28/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
577, 5, BV,Clumpy white_ cottage cheese stuff that had a fishy smell.,I am extremely excited to have found this message board.  I'm more informed by everyones input than I was with the pamphlet.  I'm completing my 5th dose tonight and hopefully this will be the last.  In 2 days_ the fishy smell did go away.,F,39,5  days,11/21/2005,Metrogel-vaginal

579, 3, Bacterial Vaginitis,I found this medication to work quickly in relieving my discomfort -- however I was totally disgusted by the huge white clumps of discharge I had a few days after I started taking the medication. I just finished my treatment a couple days ago and I'm still having the nasty discharge along with some itching.  I was really getting freaked out until I stumbled on this website.  I'm glad to know I'm in good company! I was afraid I had something terribly wrong with me and was planning on phoning my gyno the very next day!,I agree that the manufacturer needs to include all side-effects in the instructions. I almost passed out when I saw that strange discharge -- never experienced anything like that before. Was beginning to wonder if I was human! I was so freaked out that I read the instructions throughly several times and found nothing on the thick_ clumpy discharge. It does list discharge as a possible side effect_ but there is no description of it. Most people would only assume it would be a normal discharge not some freak-show type thing! I hope this goes away soon because it is embarassing. There's no way I'm having sex until it's gone! I think I'll ask my gyno for alternative treatments next time!,F,25,5  days,11/17/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
580, 5, BV,Within two days the slimy_ smelly discharge was gone; however_ as most of you have described I started experiencing the white_ clumpy_ wet toilet paper-like discharge. I was THIS close to calling my doctor's after hour service this evening. Sheesh_ I'm glad to see that it is a common side effect (one that should had been indicated in the pamphlet)I've had some mild cramping (then again I am expecing my period in 5 days)_ some light nausea_ and a little bathroom frequency (stool) - But it is worth it considering what it was like BEFORE I started taking Metrogel.,It truly works! But as mentioned before_ everyone's body is different - some may have less severe side effects_ some may not.,F,33,5  days,11/14/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
581, 3, BV,the lovely tissue papery gunk that everyone has mentioned.,has anyone been prescribed this drug for an indefinite amount of time? saw my gyno who prescribed two weeks of it and the BV still didn't go away. now she's saying to take it twice a week forever! not sure how good it is for my body to constantly be on antibiotics and if i'm not supposed to be drinking while on this stuff_ my quality of life has gone way the hell down!,F,23, ,11/14/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
582, 4, Bacterial Vaginosis,Thick_ white_ clumpy_ toilet paper-like discharge.  Absolutely disgusting!,I've had BV quite a few times and have always found Metrogel effective in curing it.  The odor always disappears within 1-2 days of the first dose of the medication.  However_ soon after_ I develop the awful discharge that everyone else on the website mentions.  At first_ I immediately went to my doctor thinking it was a yeast infection and was told that it was just the discharge associated with the medication.  It was scary and continues to disgust me.  I think I will try the oral medication next time around.,F,29,5  days,11/7/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
583, 5, BV during pregnancy,Chunky white clumps like everyone else seems to have had_ i guess i prefer that to the slime that was coming out before. At 35 weeks pregnant you never know what's gonna be coming out that end! The smell is gone_ the slime is gone...  just seem to have horribly horribly dry skin since i started taking it.,,F,25,5  days,10/29/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
584, 5, BV,I started on the metrogel after having tan to brown vaginal discharge.  The day after starting the metrogel the brown discharge disapearred_ although a white_ rubbery discharge started.  I was SO scared.  Finally I called my MD and was told it is normal and a follow up visit.  I still was very concerned until I found this website.,Metrogel needs to put this side effect on the patient information sheet.  It would have saved me from 3 days of worrying.,F,28,5  days,10/27/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
585, 4, abnormal pap,tons of white nasty discharge.  I was also very hot.  I temp in the morning and noticed that my temps were climbing.

Fabulous!,Better side effect info,F,29,5  days,10/26/2005,Metrogel-vaginal

587, 2, Bacterial Vaginitats,I felt sick to my stomach and had that crappy white cottage cheese discharge.,I had to go through it twice and i still am not able to have sex.

I hope the burning stops soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!,F,17,2  days,10/11/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
588, 5, BV,Yeast Infection,I'm prone to BV so I consider myself a professional Metro-Gel user. I've been familiar with this drug for over 5 years_ it's second nature to pick up a box of Monistat when I pick up the Metro-Gel with the expectation that as soon as I complete the pink box_ I'll hit the blue. It's really no big deal_ it's kind of like rebooting your vaginal area...once you're done everything is completely back to normal!!,F,30,15  times,10/9/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
589, 2, Bacterial Infection,I too experienced the clumpy_ white_ rubbery discharge.,I too am thankful to find this site_ I have been trying to find out what this gross discharge was coming from.  I figure that it is the gel mixing with the current discharge. This is my last night using the metro gel and i am now fearful that there are many side effects to come_ after reading all the other comments.  I have had this type of infection before_ but i have always treated it with the metrogel's counterpart_ flagyl_ it works very well except it leaves a weird metallic taste in your mouth_ which leaves in about 30 mins.  In comparison to the gel the pills are a better option.  Having a heavy cycle_ weird discharge_ vaginal dryness_ and pain are not worth it!,F,24,5  days,10/6/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
590, 4, bv,White discharge very much like wet toliet paper.,I was so scared my doctor also didn't mention this possible side effect thank goodness for this site.,F,26,5  days,10/2/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
591, 1, BV during pregnancy,Cramping for a whole day_ which caused  a lot of anxiety_ as I'm 5 months pregnant- my ob/gyn decided to take me off the medication after one dose as a result. She found cottage cheese-like discharge already after one day- she thought it was candida_ which I did not have the day before when she examined me. I also have developed very dry and tingly lips and cracks in the corner of my mouth.,In my opinion it's poison. I would never take this drug again. I'm just grateful my baby appears to be OK.,F,42,1  days,9/21/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
592, 5, BV,White_ rubbery - clumps inside of vagina.  Not really a discharge.  I examined my vagina to see if the other discharge I had before taking Metrogel was gone: it was - but very surprized to find the new white clumps inside my vagina.,Metrogel vaginal medication MUST include this side effect in their literature when this product is dispensed.  It was was distressing - wondering what NOW could be the problem in my vagina.  Other than that_ I was greatful to be rid of the bloating_ acheing ovaries_ and frequency to urinate associated with BV.,F,47,5  days,9/18/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
593, 4, BV,Like everyone has already said i was vewry glad to stumble upon this sight to find out that the discharge is normal..but i want to have sex again_ hah! And for all of you that have re-occuring BV..my doctor said to use a condom for a month after you stop taking the medication so your bacteria can return to normal...i dont know if anyone knew that_ but it might help!,,F,20,5  days,9/16/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
594, 4, BV,this medication worked great it got rid of the smell the first day.  i contiued use for about a week and a couple days and then got my period and everythign was fine.  as soon as i got back to school_ about 3 weeks later_ i felt some symptoms agian so i decided to start using it until it was gone and now i am experiencin a very think_ very white cottage-cheese_ wet toliet paper substance excreting from my vagina_ i thought i had a bad yeast infection but there was albsolutley no smell and only a little burning but no itching.   i had no clue that these were some symptoms but it didnt happen until i started to use it again.,i think i am going to use a natural way to correct my bacteria.,F,19,10  weeks,9/16/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
595, 4, BV and Cervicitis,Today makes it my second day i have inserted the cream. As usual i was looking at myself in the mirror and realised that i had this thick white clumpy discharge by the emtrance of my vagina. So i inserted a clean finger and when i pulled it out_ the clumpy white stuff was all over my finger. As usual i freaked out AGAIN. But then i read all these other people that experienced the same thing. So i am waiting to finish the rest of my gel. By the way_ the doctor told me that i got cervicits due to the BV. What happened was that my body was OVER secreting a milky white discharge and i found it unusual_ so i went to the doctor and he said that the gland that surround my cervix is over producing mucous as a defence mechanism. that's how i started the metrogel. Anyway guys_ i hope this helps anybody with additional info. I will update my symptoms when i am finished my gel. Another point_ the flagyl did NOT work the first time and i am NOW on the metrogel. So flagyl doesn't necessarily work al,So far it's working,F,24,2  days,9/16/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
596, 4, BV,First laet me state how and  why I'm taking metrogel. I went to my doctor because of abnormal vaginal bleeding. So she did the pap and I'm having a vaigianl ultra sound. In the meantime she said there was bacteria in my vagina_ she perscribed metrogel for 7 days. I'm on my sixth day. I'm experincing rasberry colored cottage cheeze like discharge. It is gross. The blood color in the discharge is very differnt color from the blood I was having before the metrogel.,I didn't know a yeast infection was a side effect. Oh NO! I was told not to drink ( haven't) Has anyone gotten sick from metrogel and drinking?,F,30,6  days,9/16/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
597, 5, Bacterial Vaginosis,Some clumpy discharge_ which was white at first_ but with the onset of my period produced some of the strangest discharge Ive ever seen. :)It was red and brown_ and clumpy like before. But it really didnt last long. My period though_ has been much heavier than usual_ and it could be from the Metrogel.,I didn't really have any symptoms from my BV. I wouldn't have known if I hadnt gone in for a random exam. So Im assuming the stuff worked.,F,21,5  days,9/15/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
598, 1, bv,chunky pink discharge like others describe_ cramping_ sensitivity.,"I""ve also had bv about 4-5 times.  I did some study on pH levels- when the vagina is acidic ( as opposed to alkalytic) it harbors bad bacteria and the good ones die out.  I also take acidophilus_ and there is a tea tree oil remedy that works well.  I got this one from a colleague of my NP: Create a tea tree oil mixture with tea tree oil and a buffer oil (I use olive oil).  The tea tree oil must be therapeutic grade_ and it is a good idea to do a patch test before putting the mixture in you. Make up some mixture and swab it on your inner arm around your elbow and cover it up.  Wait 24 hours to see if you develop a reaction.  If not_ put drops of tea tree oil on a plate with 1-2 tsp. other oil and soak it up with a tampon and insert before bed.  Do it for a week and it will clear up the bv w/o all those crazy and horrifying side effects.  Im sure you can find info about this remedy online.  Thank God I found this site!!

599, 3, ,I finished taking my medicine one day ago and since have had the dry_ clumpy discharge everyone else is describing.  My vulva feels irritated.  I have a slight burning feeling too.  I can't tell if this has cleared up the infection since the only symptom I had before was an burning vulvar sensation.,The patient information definitely should mention the discharge_ vaginal dryness_ and the vulva irritation.,F,37,5  days,9/12/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
600, 3, BV,It didn't seem to cure the BV because I still had tons of greenish discharge even days after I finished the dose. So I started back up again and am now getting that white_ tissue-like discharge you all have described. I feel so gross. I'm glad it's not a yeast infection. My husband's about to divorce me as it is!,Didn't work when I took it once a day for five days. Had to start up again.,F,31,5  days,8/27/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
601, 3, bacterial vaginosis,I believe this medicine caused my period to come two days late. Then when it did come it was like I was having a miscarriage. There was an excessive amount of tissue-like greyish white substance that scared me so bad I went to the emergency room. It was like my insides were falling out. Now I am currently bleeding so heavily that my normal daily activities are limited. At the emergency room I tested negative for pregancy so they told me this is normal. I know my body and I have never seen anything like this ever.,,F,21,4  days,8/27/2005,Metrogel-vaginal

Ibuprofin couldn't even take away joint pain.I have taken this med prior to this time_and never experienced such horrible effects! I didn't however experience any discharge as other users did.

605, 5, Odor following uterine procedure,This is the second time I have taken Metrogel-Vaginal - the first time was last June_ when_ at my very first gyno appointment_ some abnormal bacterial activity was found - however_ they mentioned nothing about bacterial vaginosis_ so I don't know for sure whether I had it or not. The second time was after I had a dilate and evacuate procedure for a small cyst_ and I noticed a rather strong_ foul odor - my gynecologist told me this was quite frequent for post-procedure women_ and prescribed the drug again. Both times I experienced the same toilet-papery or cottage-cheese-like symptoms - the second time it contained some reddish clumps because the spotting from the procedure had just stopped a few days prior. What I think the toilet-papery discharge might be caused by is the congealing of the clear gel when it reacts with the already-existing vaginal discharge - notice that nothing clear comes back out after the application? - and since the cervix is closed to keep foreign substances from entering the uterus_ it couldn't have disappeared up there. Either way_ it helped me greatly - I did have mild cramping_ and the discharge lasted a few days after I finished the dosage_ but it was a small price to pay.,Drugs are different for EVERYONE. This was just my experience with Metrogel-Vaginal - depending on numerous factors_ you may experience more or even less side effects than I did. It's not worth it for everyone - talk to your gynecologist about concerns you may have before or while taking this medication.,F,19,5  days,7/24/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
606, 3, BV,The first night I took it_ I felt like it was working. 2-3 days later_ the snot like substance discharge turned into that wet toilet paper. I thought it was from me wipping too much.

607, 5, BV_ Bacterial Vaginosis,This is the 2nd time I've had BV. There were 4 months in between each infection. Both experiences had the same effects.  I had TERRIBLE cramping in my lower right abdominal area. Sometimes it also felt like my ovaries were throbbing really hard and going to burst!  I also experienced a mild stomach ache and of course a small amount of white discharge.  The first time I took MetroGel_ I immediately felt better on day 2.  I had to finish the 5 day dosage and I was fine until now!!  This time_ I have taken 2 doses_ but I have the gross lumpy white discharge like others have described.  I was thinking I have a really bad yeast infection_ but thank you all for sharing your stories and making me feel better!  My symptoms are slowly minimizing now hopefully I won't get this again!,I hate to insert this stuff_ but hey it works.,F,22,5  days,7/22/2005,Metrogel-vaginal

610, 1, BV,I am so thankful I found this site.  I am also experiencing the same white toilet paper-like discharge and had no idea if it was normal or what to make of it.  Now I see it is a common side effect.  I really wish I had read this board BEFORE I took the medication_ as the burning I originally had has increased significantly since I finished taking the medication 2 days ago and the discharge only seems to be getting worse.  Sex is also very painful_ due to dryness and irritation.  I never had any odor to begin with_ so I dont know if the infection is actually gone.  I have scheduled a follow-up appt. with my doctor and will post again in a few days to update my progress.,Look for an alternative to this medication_ as the cons out-weigh the pros. Had I known about the severity of the side-effects_ I would have not taken this medication at all.,F,32,5  days,7/10/2005Email,Metrogel-vaginal

614, 5, BV,After a few days of using it I noticed the toilet paper like discharge. It lasted about 2 or 3 days and went away. At first i thought this was a crazy yeast infection caused from the antibiotic w/o any of the usual other symptoms until I came here and saw other people had it. I think it is maybe some of the medication that isn't absorbed by your body coming back out in a different form. Or possibly the meds mixing with your bodies own fluids creatin this wierd toilet paper stuff. Honestly_ im not sure- but after visiting this site i see many people have this. Other side effects were mild abdominal cramping_ metallic taste in mouth_ and a headache (which might not even be in relation to taking the medicine).,The medicine worked well for me. After being on it for 2 days I felt completely cured- but its important to finish the entire prescription so I did. This was my first BV and to me an overall horrrrrrible experience. So i did some massive research! If you're suffering from BV or yeast infection_ even UTI a good idea is to take an over the counter supplement of Acidophilus (lactobacillus acidophilus). It is a probiotic (natural healthy bacteria necessary to defend against bad bacteria). It comes in pill form in the vitamin section. It is the good bacteria that is found in your vagina (also intestines_ mouth_ and urinary tract). It and other probiotics are found in yogurt. A BV is when the good bacteria (acidophilus) is depleted and the bad bacteria takes over. so taking this can help cure BV by giving yourself an ample supply of good bacteria to fight off the BV ( and even yeast infection). Taking it on a regular basis also helps keep your vagina flora balanced greatly reducing BV's and yeast infections. Also taking antibiotics such as metrogel kills both good bacteria and bad bacteria in the vagina. Taking this supplement during and even after treatment insures that your body regains more than enough of the good bacteria to ward off another recurring infection.,F,20,5  days,6/14/2005,Metrogel-vaginal

617, 1, Abnormal Pap,Well now that I've read the other entries_ I too had the clumpy dischard_ however mine looked more like flesh instead of wet toilet paper. I didn't have any clues prior to my pap that anything was wrong; however I will say I began to bleed the day after I began administering the medication and I'm still bleeding 8 days later extremely heavy and I'm worried. If the bleeding doesn't stop within the next two days I'm going to the hospital_ screw the doctors office_ I need someone with machines in the office who can run a few more tests.,I'm not sure if this medicine worked or not. My doctor only said that I had to take it with no true explination as to why. I hope the bleeding is not a result of the medication but I'll soon find out. Good luck to every one else out there.,F,23,5  days,6/3/2005,Metrogel-vaginal

Also there's...cell matter? Every time i wipe it's there and now it's started acting like a usual discharge and it's on my underwear enough to soak through to my jeans.

This is my second time on it in 3 months_ and I have the same dryness that gives me pain after I have sex. I am in the healthcare industry and I was shocked and scared by the effects of the medicine. The company should really put it in the drug package insert. Contact the company to complain_ it is an FDA violation if they do not add it to their drug information once they hear about this great number of similiar side effects!,I am going to try to take a vaginal moisturizer after this does to see if it helps with the dryness.,F,24,14  days,5/26/2005,Metrogel-vaginal

624, 2, colposcopy / cryotherapy,i had an abnormal pap which led to a colposcopy and cryotherapy of my cervix.  my doctor prescribed this following both procedures (about 2 months apart).  following the colposcopy i took the medication for 7 days and had the white clumpy discharge that has been described before.  i got my period during this time and it completely changed that as well.  my doctor said he'd never heard of anyone else's period being affected by this medication.  my period returned to normal the following month.  but following the cryotherapy i had the white discharge_ however_ my cervix doesn't seem to be healing and the discharge is like nothing i've ever seen before_ red and clumpy (possibly scaby) 3 weeks later.  i stopped the medication last night.,ask your doctor for an alternative treatment before settling on this.,F,35,22  days,4/22/2005,Metrogel-vaginal
