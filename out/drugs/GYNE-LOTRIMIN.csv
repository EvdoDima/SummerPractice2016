0, 5, Vaginal yeast infection,None.  This is a great product.,I've used Gyne-Lotrimin off and on for years to treat yeast infections caused by antibiotics and some birth control pills.  Both the 3-day pack and the 7-day pack work great for me_ and they never cause the HORRIBLE burning sensation that I get from the competitor product (Monistat).,F,41, ,7/22/2006,Gyne-lotrimin
