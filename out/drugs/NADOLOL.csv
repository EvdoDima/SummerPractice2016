0, 5, mitral valve prolapse,Initially_mild fatigue until becoming acclimated. Since then I have had no issues.,Insurance dropped coverage of nadolol_ so Dr. recommended weaning off of drug. When I got to the point of taking 10mg every 3rd day my pulse increased_ I started to tremble and couldn't sleep. Had to return to original dose. Dr. is currently searching for replacement.,F,71,20  years20 mg 1X D,4/16/2014,Nadolol
1, 4, Tachycardia/ long QT syndrome,fatigued_ decrease in blood pressure (at one point i had to decrease my dose because i was having bouts of pre syncope) _ slowed heart rate,overalll effective drug but needed to be taken regularly as well with any other medications. missed a dose and wasn't eating right one time and went in to ventricular tachycardia.,F,16,4  years40 MG 2X D,4/10/2013,Nadolol
2, 1, Tachycardia_ PVC,I had to be taken off this drug. The tiredness and brain fog was disabling. I am on pindolol which seems better. When I switched_ the tremors were horrid. Nadolol is addictive. My 5 days of tremors proves it. Do not stop without a Drs help. I could def see where one could have serious problems stopping this medication.,,F,46,1  years75 mg,11/30/2012,Nadolol
3, 3, Migraines,Depression_ anxiety_ decreased sex drive,Have previously taken 15 years ago and do not remember same side effects.  Works like a charm on daily headaches and monthly migraines.  Will look for other solutions this time due to side effects.,F,40,2  months40mg 1X D,11/24/2012,Nadolol
4, 5, Chronic Migraines,A stranger told me about this drug and it has changed my life.  I've suffered with migraines that were at times up to 3-4 times per week.  I was barely functioning.  Now_ I take 40mg a night and I can't remember the last migraine.  Truly a miracle.,TRY IT!!!,F,34,6  months40 MG 1X D,3/13/2012Email,Nadolol
5, 4, Anxiety_ High Blood Pressure,Low pulse rate around 42-46,Is working very well so far at 40mg dosage. Nice chill pill and also very effective for blood pressure_ currently around 122/78.,M,56,2  months,12/21/2009,Nadolol
6, 2, Dysautonomia,Major Depression_ some anxiety_ balance problems & dizziness.,I have been on beta blockers for 4 years_ so I'm very used to them. This is the very first bb that has ever caused major depression and odd thought patterns_ which was very disturbing. On the plus side_ it chased away my migraines at 40mgs a day_ and kept my heart rate well under control_ with mild to moderate level BP control.,F,34,4  months,7/8/2008,Nadolol
7, 5, migraine,my hands and feet were always warm_ even when it's winter. but they're almost always cold now_ especially the fingertips. it also causes very bad nightmares if I take 1-2 hours before going to bed. my doctor told me that it could cause nausea but I didn't experience such thing. I take it immediately after I wake up in the morning.,I've had migraine headaches since I was 13-14 and doctors didn't want to believe me since I was too young. Last year I decided to quit caffeine and the headaches got worse. I had a continuous headache for more than a month. (I went to bed with headache and woke up with it during that time) My neurologist prescribed me nadolol and at first it seemed useless but after 3 weeks my headaches vanished. Now I have 1 or less migraine attacks per month and rarely not-very-painful headaches. I started with 40mg per day and now I take 20mg. It was the most pain-free year of my life for more than 10 years!,F,24,1  years,1/14/2008,Nadolol
8, 4, sudden arrythmia death syndrome,strong fatigue_ dry mouth. (120 mg daily)i got off nadolol for a short period of time just to see how my body felt without it.  any time i exerted myself at all_ i could feel and hear my pulse pounding in the back of my head.  all around i just felt more clear-headed though_ like a bit of a fog was lifted_ but for the sake of my heart i got back on it.it's a rough drug to be on as a teenager.,it slowed down my heart rate dramatically (i recently gave blood and my pulse was 54 when they checked it)_ but all in all it is very effective.,F,17,4.5  years,6/9/2007,Nadolol
9, 2, high heart rate,makes my penis soft,,M,31,1  years,7/6/2006,Nadolol
10, 2, tachycardia,I take it at night_ but the only side effects I really noticed were the coldness in the hands and feet which were of course worse because it was winter time.,I was given this med by my neurologist to take in addition to nortriptyline because I have mitral valve/severe tachycardia...however it didn't really help at all.  My heart rate is still 120/bpm even with being on the med_ and it lowered my blood pressure alot_ so we were unable to increase the dosage.,F,19,8  months,4/15/2006Email,Nadolol
11, 4, high blood pressure,sometimes blood pressure drops a little too low. Increased fatigue sometimes. Dry mouth sometimes.,prescribed due to increased heart rate along with high blood pressure. This drug has been generally effective. Took a little time to get right daily dosage (for me_ 60 mg/day). Dosages above and below cause undesirable fluctuations in blood pressure.On occasion_ light headedness in morning. On this medication for3 years.,M,35,3  years,7/20/2002,Nadolol
12, 5, Heredofamiliar tremor,None,Better than Inderal/Propranolol since it is water soluble_ and non-toxic to the liver.  Essentially the same drug_ but Nadolol need be taken only once per day vs. twice daily for Inderal.,M,50,4  years,8/14/2001,Nadolol
