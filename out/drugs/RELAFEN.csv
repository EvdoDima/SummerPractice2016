3, 3, osteoarthritis in shoulders,Extreme diarrhea,It's working great on my shoulder pain_ but...being up all night at least 5 times an hour to use the bathroom is going to stop me from taking it.

9, 3, leg/foot pain_ possible RA,Worst stomach issues I have ever had in my life!  Running to the bathroom constantly_ with cramping and gas.  I am miserable.,Has helped some with the leg pain_ but not completely.  Not sure if the stomach issues are worth it.  I am trying to give it a while to see if it evens out_ but_ geeze!  Hopefully_ once I see a rheumatologist_ we can try something else.,F,38,3  weeks1500 mg 1X D,4/17/2013,Relafen
10, 5, lumbar pain and joint pain,Rarely--ringing in the ears_ some swelling in legs.,I have used Relafen for over 20 years.  It was the only thing that helped me with nerve pain and joint inflammation.  I have tried *everything* else over the years--anti-depressents_ other NSAIDS_ Cox-2_ neurontin_ and codeine type pain relievers with little success. Relafen is what works for me...and that is the point.  I am told NSAIDS are highly individual--what works for one person may not help another.  So if Relafen is not it_ try another.  But for me it has been a Godsend. During a bad flare_ I do sometimes have some swelling in my legs and tinitus that I think is dose related. These issues resolve quickly if I lower the dosage and cut back on salt_ stay hydrated.  I take breaks from the medication whenever I can_ but have taken it for months and years at a time. I find it works better in a single_ higher dosage than split dosages.  500 2x daily does not work for me_ but 1000 mg once a day does the job. Discuss dosage strength with your doctor.  It also has a tendency to cause insomnia in me so I take it first thing in the day rather than last.,F,55,20  years1000 1X D,1/4/2013,Relafen
