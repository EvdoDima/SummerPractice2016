0, 5, fatty embolism after hip replacemen,None so far.  Was extremely tired after awaking from coma following fatty embolism in brain from breaking hip and getting replacement.  I was talking but had slow response.  This medicine was able to perk me up enough to participate in physical therapy and continue to improve.  Tried to go off but it really is improving my mental state.,,F,75,4  months 1X D,12/5/2011Email,Symmetrel
