0, 3, POTS,Insomnia_ shortness of breath_ confussion_ joint pain_ weakness_ nausea_ mood swings_ increased thirst_ extreme fatigue_ bruising,Although I am getting a belting from the side effects_ I don't pass out 8-15 times a week anymore... Now its 1-4 times... This is a very big change and I am okay with having side effects if it means less collapsing.,F,19,3  months0.1mg x3 d,7/31/2016,Florinef
1, 3, Neurocardiogenic Syncope,Migraines_ Weight gain_ dry skin and lowered immune system.. I would sometimes take half a tablet instead of a whole one. I did feel improvement but it took many months on the drug. My fatigue and exercise intolerance is still present but it went from being really bad to just unpleasant. It enabled me to begin light exercise again. I began to get very bad_ head crushing type migraines. Some would last a week. Thought it was due to NCS but have noticed its when I take the drug_ and not on days I skip it. Also weight gain_ around 5kgs. I have a small frame so this feels more like 10kgs. Unable to lose weight while on this drug. I am weaning off now_ but keep up my salt and water intake. Do not fight infection well or heal as well as I used to. DRY SKIN especially on feet and legs to the point where it was bleeding from me scratching despite using many good quality moisturisers and oils.,It has done wonders for me in enabling me to live a restricted but normal life. However_ the side effects are a bit too much. My GP said my immune system has lowered also. I will try licorice/root and it says it has a similar effect_ however I know licorice root does effect the GI system so I will see how that goes. I still recommend trying it for the newly diagnosed and sticking with it to see how much better things can be. I have reconditioned myself through exercise and light weight training thanks to this drug_ so coming off it will be easier.,F,29,1  years0.1 1X D,4/13/2016Email,Florinef
2, 2, Low blood pressure & dizziness,Taking due to chronic low bp for no known reason. Negative for cushings. I don't feel it's worth the side effects which are mood changes & low energy. I'm going to wean off,,F,55,1  months1 mg,3/9/2016Email,Florinef
3, 1, Addisons disease,Headache_ blurred vision_ cranial pressure_ just feeling lousy,First time I tried it had a horrible experience. Endocrinologist cut my cortef dosage in half and then added florinef_ which I had not taken previously. Couldn't stand it any longer after four days. I cut out the florinef and went back to my original dosage of cortef and began to feel normal again.Got a new endo and adjusted my cortef down without florinef to where I still felt okay. Then added florinef again. Same problems as before. Cut florinef in half. Still felt lousy. Cut florinef altogether and felt better again.For addisons patients_ it is supposed to substitute for the natural hormone aldosterone but in my case I don't tolerate it.,M,60,4  days125 mcg 1X D,10/22/2015Email,Florinef
4, 3, POTS,None with .05mg_ multiple side effects after increasing dose to .1mg,I took this for about one year with no problems. Dr. decided to up dosage & I experienced multiple severe side effects including weakness_ shortness of breath_ pressure in head and confusion. I went back to original dosage and side effects continued. Lowered dosage to 1/4 of a pill or .025mg and am still experiencing side effects immediately after taking_ for about two weeks. I am greatly wanting to stop this medication but I am afraid of what side effects there will be from that.,F,22,1  years.05mg 1x d,4/10/2015Email,Florinef

6, 1, Parkinson's and nausea,Makes me extremely sick to my stomach with all the other meds I am taking. Went off it and felt better. Went back on and immediately felt nauseous.,,,,1  years.1 2X D,4/6/2014,Florinef
7, 4, Neurally Mediated Hypotension,Some water retention in the first 2 weeks_ then went away.Some migraines/headaches and pressure in my head_ but went away as my body adjusted.Now that im adjusted the extreme fatigue I felt from even minor/moderate exercise is gone.Took me weeks to figure out the correct dosage. Florinef has a long half life and takes your body a long time to adjust.People who complain about headaches should try a lower dose and try again.  Stay on the same dose for at least 2 weeks before changing it again_ unless you are in lots of pain from headaches.   Best to start with a small dose and go up until you hit side effects_ and then back off a bit. It can take several months to find the right dose for year.Also_ I start every day with a big glass of water filled with 1 teaspoon of salt.

8, 2, POTS,Severe edema of feet/ankles.,I'm not sure this medication helped my POTS much - I was still having some episodes of pre-syncope even after I'd been on this med a few weeks.  After a particularly bad pre-syncope episode I took in extra salt as directed by my doctor and as I'd been doing prior to starting this med - and several hours later my right foot was twice the size of my left.  I never had edema of any kind before this_ and the swelling started to go down as soon as I stopped the Florinef.  My doctor later re-introduced this med at a reduced dose_ and the edema came right back_ although milder this time.,F,35,30  days0.1 mg 1X D,12/27/2011Email,Florinef
9, 4, POTS - Postural Orthstc. Tacy. Synd,Feel somewhat better; however_ my periods are nuts - average bleeding about half of any given month. It's ridiculous. (And I have been on the same birth control for 6+ years; no other med changes),,F,27,3  months10mg 1X D,3/15/2011Email,Florinef
10, 1, neurocardiogenic syncope,Dizziness_ lightheadedness_ migraines_ nausea,I've been takind florinef for five months in addition to midodrine to treat neurocardiogenic syncope. For the first couple months i took it i honestly couldn't tell the difference_ it didn't seem to help or hurt. But_ lately i've been getting dizzy spells much more frequently and nothing seemed to make them go away. They would occur for days at a time with migraines and nausea. I stopped taking Florinef 3 days ago and already feel much better!,F,21,5  months,12/7/2009Email,Florinef

12, 5, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Sy,fluid retention_ a little puffiness,"I LOVE FLORINEF! I have been taking it for 2+ years_ and I must say_ it has saved me. I would love to advise all of you out there trying it for POTS to stick with it. It took me 6 months to feel a bit better_ and a FULL YEAR on Florinef to be close to normal again. I Swear by it! My cardiologist told me it can take over 6 months on it until you start feeling more like yourself. I was patient_ and am glad I was. I have had no real side effects other than gaining about 5 extra pounds. Who cares when it makes you feel human again! I have tried to stop taking it a few times to see if it was just coincidental and maybe I really was getting better_ but I was wrong. It's the florinef. After about 2 weeks off it I feel like I am dying agin. It has really saved me. PLEASE give it a shot!! AND YES YOU MUST STILL EAT A LOT OF SALT OR IT WON""T WORK! There is no point taking it if you don't up your salt volume. I try to eat 3-5 tsp a day. I mix it in my water and juts chug it down.",F,39,2  years,6/30/2009Email,Florinef
13, 5, hypotension/migraines,slight water retention_ not enough to make me stop taking it,After years of searching for a cure for my migraines_ i have found it! When I told the doctors I got a headache from standing/sitting_ they said it was sinuses. I knew it had to be my low blood pressure and finally convinced one doctor to prescribe this and I finally am migraine free 90% of the time. I am no longer afraid of the throbbing pain I will experience when getting out of bed or standing from a chair.,F,32,6  weeks,3/27/2009,Florinef
14, 2, Neurocardiogenic Syncope,water retention_ but this medication did not decrease or prevent any syncope spells with .3mg a day_ so now ive been switched to toprol...we will see if that works,,M,21,1  years,11/20/2008,Florinef
15, 5, Orthostatic hypotension,None.,I have orthostatic hypotension/neurocardiogenic syncope as determined through a tilt table test.  I was constantly having episodes of frequent urination_ dehydration and dizzy spells when getting up and standing too long.  While I don't think I will ever be healed_ the Florinef has made all the difference in the world.  If I do not take it one day_ I pay for it with near syncope spells.  The doctor initially told me to increase my salt and fluids_ but that did not work so they put me on 0.1 mg a day.  Florinef has been a miracle drug for me.,F,38,2  months,4/2/2008Email,Florinef
16, 4, POTS-Postural Tachyicardia Syndrome,None really- fluid retention in legs but nothing significant,Before being diagnosed with POTS (Postural orthostatic Tachyicardia Syndrome) and being put onto Florinef_ i was unable to function_ i couldnt go to work and could barely leave my house because i was always feeling unwell because of the syptoms of POTS- I was living a very lonely life in my house because i wasnt feel enough to leave it_ but since taking florinef i have to certain extent got my life back_ im not cured but the medication certainly helps me to be somewhat normal again- i now have a job_ even though i have good and bad days_ with the medication i now have more good days than i use to have bad!!!,F,26,2.5  years,9/18/2007,Florinef
