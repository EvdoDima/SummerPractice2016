1, 1, Lower back pain,Took away the pain after 1 dose but made me very sleepy the next day. Still feeling lightheaded and foggy even 3 days after I stopped taking it. Very dangerous and scary drug.

3, 1, Lower back pain.,"Let me give you some general information about myself. I'm twenty-three years old_ I'm 277 pounds_ and I'm a girl. Prior to this medication_ I was 288 pounds. I took this medication only three days and suffered horrible side-effects. I've always been moderately depressed_ yet I've always kept in check_ I've been walking and exercising_ working a great job and making friends. But depression has always been a constant with me.I think the cyclobenzaprine pushed me over the line_ I felt great bouts of energy-- I felt amazing_ I said_ ""Is this what it's like for people who are physically active and emotionally capable?"" Eight hours pass. I'm still on a high. I feel physically tired but my mind is still going. I need to get something done_ I think-- but I've already clocked out. What's going on? My mind feels blank_ I can't think_ my heart is pounding. I go to pick up my boyfriend_ and I say several times_ ""Something's not right with me."" Before I get home and break down into a hysterical crying fit. That wasn't the last time it'd happen while on this medicine. I cried so many more times_ went to urgent care_ said ""I don't feel like I'm in my body.."" they took my blood pressure and said it was very irregular_ then along the line_ someone said it was anemia. So I upped the vitamin intake and iron intake_ as well as the B12.. it's helped with the side effects_ I'm still recovering... but I still suffer lack of motivation and can't get out of bed. Unfortunately",Will not take again..,F,23,3  days10,7/21/2016Email,Flexeril

7, 1, lower back pain rupture disk,I was given high dose of Ibuprofen 2400mg a day and told to take flexeril at night to help me sleep. DANGER BEWARE.....First the ibuprofen does not work on me at all at the level of pain. YES they say it does but nsaids never do on me maybe I'm allergic not sure tried to tell the doctor that but they don't listen. I have taken flexeril with vicadin and hydrocodone and had no problem but this time they refused to give my hydrocodone and gave me duexis some new high dosage ibuprofen and pepcid crap that by the way cost 1500.00 for a 90 day supply that they send to you in the mail? So anyway_ I believe this combo is deadly. First the Duexis did nothing for pain but did prevent me from having a bowel movement for 48 hours and boy did it hurt. The flexeril now made me feel highly anxious my eye pupils where so small And my heart rate was bouncing all over the place. I can say that I never had am issue with the flexeril before with the hydrocodone but this combo of high dose ibuprofen and flexeril I feel would of killed me if I continued. The doctor will not respond to my emails about my concerns. I discontinued both and will deal with the pain because they refuse to give the codeine based products.,Like I said the flexeril and codeine based products seem ok But when they gave it to me with that Duexis high dose of Ibuprofen 2400mg a day. After only 5 pills 800 mg each and 10 mg of flexeril at night I was in extreme distress unable to have a bowel movement_highly agitated because of the pain from my ruptured disk. And highly anxious. After stopping the duexis but it was still in my system cause I couldn't go.I took only half of.my flexeril and my heart went crazy from its normal steady rate and my blood pressure went up and rate was high. I stopped both immediately. I researched it and they say it's safe but the crap together almost killed me BEWARE.,M,52,3  days10 mg,4/24/2016Email,Flexeril
8, 1, Back pain (slipped disc),I started feeling itchy and swollen and my heart raced. I couldn't keep my legs still and felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. I finally had to call an ambulance and be admitted to the ER for taking this med- thought it was an isolated incident but both my mom and boyfriend had the same sort of reactions within six months of mine. I had taken this med a few years ago without a problem_ I'm thinking they changed the formula. Beware!!!,Would not take. Will make things MUCH WORSE than whatever your original problem was.

18, 1, Back spsms,Depression and anxiety.  Suicidal thoughts. Fortunately_ I took a small amount of B-Complex to counteract the folic acid drop. The suicidal thoughts went away within 30 minutes. Nevertheless_ the nausea and fatigue is bad. I now use the Spine Conditioning Program I downloaded from the AAOS.  The progam has reduced my spasms dramatically. I will continue to use the program instead.,NSAIDs and muscle relaxers can reduce your B2_ Folic Acid_ B12_ C_ D_ iron_ and zinc. I had to eat sunflower seeds_ take vitamin D_ and B-coomplex because these meds can reduce these nutrients. I'm okay now. No bad thoughts.

I only take it when I feel like I can't handle the pain much longer or if I know I've had pain for over a week already and it continues to progress_ overall has helped a lot way better than taking excedrin or Tylenol all the time .. it's less of a dose per say & a longer relief.. oh and the very first time I did take flexeril_ the drowsy I don't want to move a muscle feeling was highly intense but I figured it's because your body isn't used to it and within a week of the first time I took it the fatigue feeling I had began to diminish_ now it's usually gone after the first hour after I wake up.,F,26,3  days10mg,10/8/2015,Flexeril

I was taking 5 mg 3 times a day_ but I never took that much! 2 weeks ago I went to my doc and she pushed me up to 2- 5mg pills in the afternoon and 2- 5 mg pills at night! It has REALLY helped me alot with both PMS pain and my lower back issues,I worry about being on it to long_ but it helps me so will probably continue. I know on the web I have read it is supposed to be a short term used drug? I was also on tramadol_ but I also read where if you are on flexeril and tramadol_ it can harm you in many ways_ but I quit my tramadol about 3 weeks ago as it did NOTHING!Going to see an OBGYN for my PMS nad ask their advice on the flexeril...doc just called today and said she wrote me a new RX for 3- 10 mg pills a day.

41, 4, Bulging cervical discs & RA,Migraine headache (pain in one eye & the surrounding area_ sensitivity to light & sound),"Works exactly as it should_ effect very similar to that of Soma. I don't understand why people are complaining about being sleepy while on this medication. It's a muscle relaxer. Of course it's going make you drowsy. Especially if you've never taken a muscle relaxer before. People should give themselves time to adjust to a new med before throwing it out after ONE dose. That's ridiculous. Drowsy_ out of it- it's a controlled substance_ & I know your pharmacist or doctor definitely let you know that it's not meant to be used when you have to drive. Obviously if you're told that_ that should give you an idea that it's not a good idea to take it when you have other things to do. I'm on this medication and it works exactly how I expected it too. My muscles and body are relaxed_ & a good amount of pain is relieved. I do not feel ""high"" or ""foggy."" I would have given this medication 5â˜†s_ if it didn't cause migraines. A headache with light and noise sensitivity is better than not being able to get out of bed.

The muscle relaxant loosed it's hold on my vocal chords and I was singing and talking after eight months of chronic larangitis that no one else could figure out.

But now that I can take it whenever... I have a reverse curve in my neck from multiple whiplash injuries_ and flexeril is the ONLY thing that will take away my neck pain once it starts (driving long distances really aggravates it).

No hallucinations_ no coma like sleep_ it just takes the edge off the pain so I can go to work and take care of my daily responsibilities. Just be careful and you will be fine. Do not take more than recommended and start with a half dose on a day when you can stay home to see how it affects you. After a few consecutive days of taking Flexeril I do get swelling of the feet and  ankles_ but that goes away as soon as you stop taking it.,F,36, 10mg 2X D,7/29/2014Email,Flexeril

However_ Valium of course is more powerful on a psychological level. Flexeril mixes well with therapeutic doses of codeine and tramadol. But Flexeril doesn't mix with Valium -- apparently it raises serum levels of Valium substantially_ making it feel like you took 2x Valium.

77, 1, Neck tension headache,I'd had a really bad tension headache for about 2 weeks and when I went to urgent care they gave me 10 mg of the generic flexeril.  I saw that it may cause drowsiness so I took it at 3 pm when I got home.  I slept from 3 to 6 and then again from 8 to 5 the next morning and I still felt messed up like I shouldn't drive to work.  It took 24 hours for me to feel functional again after taking the 1 pill.  I am a smaller female weighing 110 lbs so things tend to hit me harder but I was not prepared for this.  The next couple of days I have had some of the worst anxiety I have ever experienced.  After reading other reviews on here I have come to the conclusion they are most likely related.

I have stopped taking it and hope that the numbness will go away soon. If it does not then I will have to assume that it is part of my injury. It has been about 36 hours and it still feels like I sprayed my throat with numbing spray. I had bad spasms after my neck locked.

I took Flexerils before surgeries so I could cope with life. After my fusions I tapered back to 20mlg at bedtime so I could wake up after 12 hrs of sleep and make it through the day. I will tell you from my long experience (20 years) on this medicine that it works well to give you a somewhat active life back_ but eventually it will weaken your muscles_ eliminating support thus creating more pain and  will Wreak HAVOC in your body later on in life as you age. I now have TACHYCARDIA (fast heart beats150 to 250 per minute) that I have to control with medication for the rest of my life. It also causes overactive mucus secretions that contribute to bronchial irritations that can lead to COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary / lung disease)  With these two side effects_ it makes managing them difficult. The bronchial medicines aggravate the Tachycardia,"USE WITH GREAT CAUTION SHORT TERM  and ""DO"" READ LOTS OF RESEARCH !!

I take 20-30mgs b4 bed & 10mgs as needed for muscle stiffness & spasms. Life is unbearable without it. ER treated me like a pill seeker after I fell & blacked out during a time I had ZERO meds & no insurance it dr_ when I asked for flexeril to prevent severe spasms. Wtf? I don't get high off my meds_ I get a life & work on them. Without them_ I'm unable to dress_ shower_ climb stairs_ eat_ think_ etc. Thank god I have family & friends who give up their meds so I can maintain some semblance of a normal life.

116, 1, Groin pain_ chronic tightness,At first I just felt tired_ but actually I felt good st first_ it definitely loosened my muscles up! After a few days I started to feel abnormally tired in the day even though I was only taking 10mg before bed. Then started to have weird dreams and bad sleep_ twitching at night waking me up. When I woke up I felt really groggy for hours then tired for the rest of the day. After about 5 days of taking it I started to have racing heart rate_ not just feeling like it was racing but I took my pulse and it was actually elevated (it is always very low). I also started to feel week and uncoordinated. On exactly the 7th night I woke up with a massive jolt and had a feeling of terrible doom_ and a racing heart rate! I felt week as a lamb and dizzy and confused_ I could barely speak! The anxiety/panic subsided after about 10 hours but the mental slowness and physical weakness and lack of coordination lasted for about 3 days which was scary. I was having weird thoughts and increased anxiety also for about 3 days. I will never take flexeril again. It definitely helped with my tight muscles but the side effects were very bad!

118, 3, Bruxism_ myofascial pain_ tmj,This med helped greatly with my jaw pain_ clenching_ and helped me sleep very well. I'm not sure if it's worth it because over time I experienced bad constipation_ was too exhausted to function_ developed muscle weakness _ just wanted to sleep. I tried to quit and had the worst pain  and migraines of my life_ thought I was going to die! Went back on it_ ended up with severe bladder infection and pelvic floor dysfunction (due to muscle weakness) . All doctors and urologist say there is nothing wrong with long term use. But I have read so many cases of people having problems. I went down to 5mg and this is my second day not taking it _ and honestly_ I'm starting to feel better_ even though my jaw is a little tight.

I see some people rating it after one day_ which seems too soon (but understand they had a terrible experience). Now I take it_ as needed (usually 2-5 nights a week). I can feel a little groggy the next day if I tried to pull off only 7 hours of sleep. But if I get a decent 8 (ideally 9)_ I feel amazing...no tightness or aching. That allows me to do my work and also continue my physical therapy_ in hopes of not having to take this forever. Very helpful muscle relaxant_ at least for me.

The emotional affects are such that I am a completely different person when I am on this drug.

When I mentioned all this to my GP_ he denied any blame on the flexeril and offered me another prescription for an anti-depressant. NO THANKS!!!! Please people...if you can control your pain with something else PLEASE DO. The medical professionals that deal in this medication are doing harm. My pain is worse now than when I started and now I am drastically ill in other ways. I say to anyone who is 'satisfied' with Flexeril_ just try stopping... It should NEVER be taken for more than three weeks...You can't avoid dependency. Well_ I couldn't.   BTW_ I was 'conscious' of the possibility of addiction when I began.

I used to have pain almost all day. Now_ it's been cut down drastically. They're still there_ but not nearly as often or severe.

I'd be asleep 'till next week! Lol anyway_ overall_ I would definitely recommend this drug. Really_ the only pronounced side effect is the lethargic feeling.

He was restless and anxious and had involuntary movement and repetitive movement.  He was allergic to this med or having withdraw symptoms from the decreased dosage.

My doctor instructed me to take it two hours before bed; because I'm med sensitive_ she gave me the option of taking half a pill instead of a whole one if I felt ""hung over"" in the morning. Even on half a pill_ I have been sleeping 12 hours and have to force myself to get out of bed_ though it hardly seems worth the effort since I have no energy or motivation to do anything due to extreme fatigue_ spaciness_ irritation_ and depression. I also have to force myself to eat_ as I have no apatite and everything tastes flavorless (not a problem you want to have at Thanksgiving!). The effects from this stuff last me until around 7pm_ so basically I'm either sitting on my couch staring at the wall while trying to ignore the stabbing pain in my head or screaming at my elderly cats for no good reason all day long (that is_ if I can resist the urge to go back to bed). It has eased my pain a good deal but hasn't helped my sleep. I've read that the action of this drug is thought by some to be similar to the old-school tricyclic antidepressants_ so it's possible that people who have problems with them might have issues with flexeril as well.

So_ if you are taking it for the first time_ just know that in the beginning you may have difficulty waking up or being alert for a period of a few hours the next day.,I was prescribed Flexeril due to severe pain from a head and neck injury I suffered from a motor vehicle accident.   I hadn't been able to sleep at night because the pain would get worse when I lay down.   The Flexeril has been fantastic!Even though it's not really a pain killer_ it relaxed my muscles to the point where I could sleep.   Sometimes I would still wake up throughout the night_ but rather than staying awake_ the Flexeril would get me back to sleep.   I love this med!A note about the dosage:  I have never taken the full 10 mg at a time.  I usually just take 1/4 to 1/2 a pill (so 2.5 to 5 mg) at night.

At best_ it helped me to get some sleep at night. At worst_ I felt like ""Noodle Woman"". It increased my anxiety and deepened my depression. I became highly sensitive to noises_ like a train going by or a construction worker jack-hammering the pavement. My teeth actually vibrated! I switched to Xanaflex_ then Robaxin and now I take Soma. It really helps the muscle spasms to settle down_ especially at night when they really start to act up--and now I am really sleeping at night for uninterrupted 7 and 8 hour stretches.

It did make me sleepy so_ I suppose_ while I slept I wasn't feeling any pain but it didn't induce a deep sleep or long lasting sleep (took one 10 mg tablet at 10:00am each day_ got drowsy and sleepy by noon_ slept until 1:00pm) therefore_ it was not an effective medication to relieve my lower back pain. The  10 mg tablets were prescribed for 10 days (one table every 8 hours)_ I only took one tablet a day for 3 days and stopped because the extreme dry mouth and spacey feeling weren't worth it because it didn't relieve my pain.  I am really bothered by the fact that it has been two days since I took the last tablet and my mouth is STILL very dry and I am still feeling spacey.

For 3 weeks I did not take it and for the last 2 of those weeks my mood was actually pretty good. I felt good with the exception of my back pain.

280, 1, bulging discs,"suicidal and homicidal thoughts_ severe rage and anger_ depression_ uncontrollable crying_ lack of motivation and self-control_ insomnia_ incessant memory ""replay"" ex: re-living horrible past events that were traumatic - unable to stop or control these thoughts_ short-term memory loss_ confusion_ lack of focus and concentration_ dizzyness/lightheadedness_ dry mouth_ constipation_ unable to urinate",The only good thing about this drug is that it did alleviate the pain and stiffness in my back. However_ the potential side-effects of this drug need to be seriously re-evaluated by the FDA. The current listed side-effects of this drug paint a very unrealistic picture of what could possibly happen to you if you take Flexeril. THIS DRUG HAS SERIOUS SIDE-EFFECTS IN SOME PEOPLE - ON THE LEVEL OF CHILDREN/TEENS TAKING PROZAC - YET THERE ARE NO WARNINGS ABOUT IT. In my opinion_ this drug should NOT be taken by anyone with EITHER a history OR current diagnosis of bipolar disorder_ depression_ anxiety or PTSD. I am seriously considering filing a lawsuit against the manufacturers of this drug because of the lack of disclosure of the potentially LIFE-THREATING side effects. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF SOMEONE KILLED THEMSELVES OR KILLED/HARMED OTHERS WHILE ON THIS MEDICATION!!! This drug nearly destroyed my life and my marriage. Thanks to this website_ I have come to the conclusion that Flexeril is the cause of my violent outbursts_ suicidal thoughts and feelings of worthlessness. Today is the first day that I did not take it and I am terrified of the withdrawal symptoms and the return of my back pain - but NOTHING is worth losing your life or family for. I would rather be sane with back pain than suicidal and pain-free. I will never_ EVER_ take Flexeril again.,M,30,1  months,7/21/2009,Flexeril

While on it_ I notice that my hair was falling out_ not severe_ but noticeable. Takes forever to wake up in the mornings. Didn't work on my fibro pain at all.,It did help me to fall asleep and stay asleep all night_ but the fatigue and hangover feeling in the morning was godawful. It did'nt help with the fibro pain at all. I went to see my psychiatrist and he said for me to use restoril instead. I cleared it with my rheumy and he said that was fine.

Shame on my doctor for not knowing this_ I plan on finding another doctor.  My anger level has increased and my energy level dropped.  I would get so anxious in the morning after the crazy drugged sleep I needed a Xanax!  I didn't know if I was having palpitations or anxiety.  Plus for someone who is vain with fine hair_ unexplained_ unexpected hair loss is just the icing on this cake of poison called Flexeril.

300, 3, Back Spasms and Pain,Flexeril has a eurphoric component and rather dulls ones mind. The very worst aspect of this medication is the psychological effects it had on me.

I don't know if it was from Flexeril alone_ or in combination with the Naprosyn and Tylenol w/codeine I was also prescribed.  Anyway_ I could only take it at night.   Even watching TV took effort_ since I was so doped up.  All this medication was necessary to make the exercises I had to do more bearable.

Sometimes it makes me sleepy but if I drink it with coffee during the day_ I'm fine.  At night_ I don't usually take it until an hour or so before bed. It does relax everything and that can be a positive or a negative.,I've taken this for several years since I first injured my neck area in 2003.

My back spasms_ if not caught early (I can feel them ""coming on"")_ are debilitating_ I cannot move at all_ not even my head or neck_ the pain is so bad even from slight movements due to breathing. My first spasm_ I didn't know what was happening and started crying_ I thought it was really serious and that I was disabled_ a back injury or something.Now_ I have learned what triggers my back spasms (upper back between the spine and shoulder blade_ running up and down next to my spine) and I can prevent most of them through hydration_ stretches_ and avoiding physical triggers such as carrying a very heavy backpack. I keep the Flexeril for occasional use when the spasms get bad and don't respond to stretching_ hydration_ and other techniques. Luckily I do not get any side effects. For those people who have experienced mild side effects_ try the 5mg dose (I've never tried the 10mg_ the 5mg works fine for my back spasms).I ca",F,29,2  years,3/3/2008,Flexeril

462, 1, Herniated disk,nausea and vomiting,This medication did not help my pain on little bit. Part of it has to do with the dr's not paying attention to my actual problem.  I felt no relief with this drug.,F,22,3  months,12/16/2004,Flexeril

464, 3, lower back pain,I took 10 mg flexeril before going to bed.   The next morning my back felt better_ but I was spacey_ disoriented_ and experienced abdominal cramping.

465, 3, muscle spasm in back,emotional and physical depression,The only thing that actually relieves the muscle spasms (other than complete bedrest for about a month) - but the pain has to be bad enough for me to be willing to tolerate 1-2 wks physical and emotional depression.Took medication off and on for a few years - I don't recall how long for any particular,F,48, ,11/30/2004,Flexeril
466, 3, Muscle spasms in my neck,Severe depression_ anxiety_ depersonalization_ vivid nightmares_ extreme dry mouth/exhaustion,Made my neck feel all nice and Jello-like_ which was great_ but this medication left me dragging half-way through the next day.  After a night's worth of realistic nightmares_ I awoke feeling more depressed than I had in a long time.  I had several anxiety attacks_ and never left my room that day.  I suffer from depersonalization normally_ but on Flexeril_ it was much worse.  I decided to try it again for one more night_ hoping it was just a fluke_ but the same thing happened.

469, 3, back spasms,dry mouth_ irregular heartbeat,this drug works pretty well for back spasms or soreness. I didn't like the irregular heart action so I discontinued after 2 months usage. I use methocarbamol and avoid any cardiac irregularities. I prefer diazepam but my doc treats that stuff like I was asking for heroin. Sad thing that all the really good meds that work the best without ill side affects are treated as street drugs are.
