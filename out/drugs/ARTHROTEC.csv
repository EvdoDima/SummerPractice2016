0, 5, Severe lower back/joint pain,Occasional gastro/uterine cramping_ diarrhea. Seems to happen for a day or two every couple months then goes away. No bleeding changes & have iud mirena which is still functioning_ maybe helps to regulate bleeding side effects?,I have never found a pain pill so effective for so long. And I have been on a lot of very strong narcotics_ so this is a complete life saver for me. I go from 10% mobility to 90+ % within an hour of taking each dose. May not work for everyone but would recommend a trial at the very least to see if pain relief>side effects.,F,34,2  years50/200,8/2/2016,Arthrotec
1, 5, knee arthritis_ torn rotator cuff,Some increased perimenopausal bleedingk_ occasional gastric discomfort_ only if taken on empty stomach.,This medicine was like a Godsend to me.  I felt like I could move like a normal person again.  I was totally despondent when I had a bad broken foot and threw a clot_ and because I had to go on blood thinners_ my Doctor took me off this drug.  I can't wait to resume taking it again.

6, 5, ,Acid reflux cured and lately Kidney pain,This is the only drug that had eliminated my pain. I had some acid reflux problems after taking it for a few years and was prescribed NEXUM etc. The cure i found for the acid reflux is take a tall glass of water and heat it to luke warm first_ then add 1 tablespoon of Braggs apple cider vinegar and one tablespoon of lemon juice . I drank this once a day for a week and now only need it about once a week. This cured my stomach side affect much much better than any meds. Now i seem to be having some kidney pain in the last 6 months and need to get that checked. At this point I'm not sure if its a kidney_ prostrate or back problem. I have cut back the arthritic to 3 a week but am having some days with major pain.Try the vinegar and lemon cure for you folks that are having the stomach issues_ far better results than any GERD meds i was ever given with no side affects.,M,63,20  years75 mg 1X D,4/29/2015,Arthrotec

The stomach cramps are so severe and I keep expecting to see blood when I wipe myself because it's so bad. I regret taking this drug because the side effect is not worth it.

12, 4, Osteoarthritis(knees)_arthritis,Very tired when I started taking medication; it wore off after about 3 weeks. Currently experiencing massive cramping (similar to the same pain I felt during miscarriage) and lengthy_ heavy periods (after almost a year without).  Also recently had pneumonia_ noted as low occurrence side effect_ although not sure if it's drug-related or not_ but seems coincidental.,The drug has worked wonders_ and given me new mobility while I wait for knee surgery. It has also helped arthritis in foot and hands. Celebrex did not work at all; this does work. However_ the cramping is unbelievable and periods_ previously non existent_ are double the length and intensity of periods in the past.

32, 1, Chest Pains,Stomach pains_ chest pains_ anxiety_ fatigue_ headache_ erratic heart beat_ raised blood pressure_ dizziness_ nausea (even when taken with food)_ blurred vision.,"I was given a 6 day trial of Arthrotec along with a 9 day trial of Aciphex on 4/25 (three bottles of three pills). This was a solution my doctor came up with. I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion_ no signs of acid reflux_ so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills_ I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps. I was at work_ so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses)_ the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start). So_ I googled the side effects of the drug_ came across this site_ and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects_ so I felt a little better about it. On the evening of 4/30_ I suddenly got some serious chest pains_ an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an ""I just finished running!"" heart rate)_ hot flashes_ dizziness_ sever stomach cramps_ and weakness in my legs. I literally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5/1)_ I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened. I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work. A friend at work had to call an ambulance. I was filled in by the ER doc that the mixture of Aciphex and Arthrotec was insane and that he was trying to keep from cracking up at my primary doc's decision to combine them.",F,20,6  days 1X D,5/2/2012,Arthrotec

34, 1, Fibromyalgia/ hip pain,Dizziness_ sickness_ stomach gas_ feel like a bubble of air is stuck in my chest. Hadn't realised it was related until I read this but I get the hunger pangs too_ I'm assuming this is the acids and gas in your stomach constantly churning over that make you feel like you're hungry.,I've taken co-codamol for my fibromyalgia for many years which I have very few side effects with. I've recently had this severe hip pain on both sides which the co codamol wasn't touching so I went back to the Dr. He recommended this anti-inflamatory and as he said next stop would be cortozone injections I was willing to give it a try. I've tried it for a week but it makes me feel dreadful. Every time I stand up I have to hold onto something for fear of falling over_ I feel sick and light headed and I get those waves of nausea where you suddenly feel all clammy. It's very much like having a permanent hangover_ even down to the hunger which until I read thsi site I hadn't connected to the rest of it. I've felt no discernible difference in the pain in my hips and the side effects simply aren't worth it so thats it for me and this drug.,F,42,7  days75mg 2X D,4/30/2012Email,Arthrotec
35, 5, low back pain_ arthritis in spins,none,I have been concerned about long term effects of Arthrotec_ but with chronic back for 9 years I cannot live without it right now.  I was shocked to read some of the comments on this website. I never had any stomach trouble_ or cramps_ or anything people have mentioned here.  People mentioned Celebrex. A friend of mine developed an ulcer after only a short time on Celebrex.   I do not have any kind of stomach trouble after 8 years.  Would I rather not take it?  Of course_ but I have to be able to get out of the bed in the morning.  I have blood work done every year to see if there's any kidney_ liver damage or anything_ and so far there hasn't been any.

Nausea occurs when I'm hungry - very odd. Irregular cramping.,This has been to date the only medicine to relieve my hip pain_ but it's affecting my quality of life.

45, 3, lower back pain from torn disc,I have been on Arthrotec for a year and a half and have been very pleased that it does help deal with my back pain. However....over the last six months_ I have started having vaginal bleeding almost every day of the month. Lots of clotting_ and horrible periods. I went to the obgyn and everything came out normal. The doc put me on birth control. But_ the bleeding has not subsided. So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed. I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect. When I came across this website_ I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy/extra vaginal bleeding. I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday_,Although this drug has helped with the pain_ it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly._ On top of that_ I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure. I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this. I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week_ yet I am still bleeding. I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks_ but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them. I feel that I have become dependent on this medicine to function.,F,31,1.5  years75 1X D,6/26/2011Email,Arthrotec

I had severe endometriosis and adenomyosis all my life_ plus the impairment in blood clotting due to EDS_ so my doctor probably should not have prescribed this drug. I'm not taking any more tablets.

I am in so much pain that I cannot sleep_ nor can I take Advil for the pain as it is also an NSAID.,The patient warning indicates that this drug can cause an abortion.

But not sure if my symptoms are due to the drug as i've been on it for so long with no side effects.,After trying several NSAIDs with side effects_ I finally discovered arthrotec which relieved the pain and no side effects.

51, 3, knee arthritis,I have taken 6 pills in the past (75mg each)_ but the side effect I had from my last pill was awful. It induced severe vaginal cramps without bleeding about 2 hours after I took the medication. I ended up having to take additional medication to get rid of the cramps (pamprin) so that I could sleep. Sat on the bathroom for 30 minutes. If I knew I would have went to bed with a sore knee instead - it hurt less than the cramps.,This is the only anti-inflammatory drug that helps for my knee pain/inflammation and its reliable in that.

59, 3, Extreme abdominal pain_ headache,I was prescribed this drug because I had spent a whole night in complete agony; abdominal pain_ lower back pain_ all that I imagine labor pain to be_ except I was not in labor. Though the cause of my pain remains undetermined_ the Arthrotec combined with Paracetamol pretty much eliminated the pain. This was a big relief_ as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing. I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick.HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work. I still had the other Arthrotec pills left_ so I took one. Although it alleviated the pain_ I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week.

60, 4, Knee joint injury,Particularly diahrea! Many unscheduled washroom stops over the time I've taken this medication. Lately ankle swelling and lower tendon pain that was not experienced previously.,Males tend to tolerate this medication better than women from my observation. This medication helped get me back to work and achieve tolerable pain levels and mobility. I stopped taking it for 4 days and the pain returned. Currently take one 75mg dose 2 hours before work and seems to be enough to ease my particular condition. Probably alright for otherwise healthy individuals but those with other medical problems should probably avoid it. It will most likely exacerbate there ill health with unwelcome side effects.,M,57,5  months75 mg 1X D,7/14/2010,Arthrotec

I experienced extreme uterine cramping within 30 minutes of taking in the morning; I was in excruciating pain for an hour so I called an ambulance and was rushed to the emergency room. Heavy bleeding started within 30 minutes after the cramping ceased.  Medical personnel dismissed the symptoms as not being related to taking this drug_ but once I stopped taking_ my cramping and bleeding stopped.  Subsequent uterine & vaginal ultrasounds did not show anything else to be the cause.  My OB/Gyn told me that she uses misoprostal (1 of the drugs in Arthrotec) for miscarriages & advised me to stop taking the drug.,I would not recommend to females.

Im probably addicted to it.Somewhat concerned about the long term effects and listed possible side effects_ so I've only ever taken arthrotec 50 once daily rather than twice_ which is just enough to manage my pain levels. I feel it has a cummulative effect.....maybe. I dont think anything will completely remove the pain_ and maybe shouldnt since it helps you to know whats going on. Else how much would you have to take_ thus increasing your risk for possible adverse reactions.,M,51,5  years,2/2/2007,Arthrotec
