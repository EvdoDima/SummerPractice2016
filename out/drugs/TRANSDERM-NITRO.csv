0, 1, Motion sickness,Dizziness_ confusion_ vertigo_ nausea and headache.,I have used transderm for years for sea sickness on cruises and never had any side effects.  For the past three years I have noticed that every time I come off a cruise and take the patch off_ I get terribly sick.  I loved the product because it allowed me to travel_ which I love to do_ without getting sick_ but now that I am experiencing side effects_ I am going to try Bonine first.  I'm experiencing what I would feel like if I were motion sick anyway.,F,42,10  days,12/18/2008,Transderm-nitro
