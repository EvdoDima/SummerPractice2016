0, 5, Hair Loss on crown,I am unsure of how there are negative side effects being experience by some people but I have experienced none. Sex drive still on point and still got solid wood,Can't say I've experienced hair growth but it has certainly prevented any more hair loss. I am just now experiencing some hairs falling out hence me coming onto this website and providing my feedback_ and to see if anyone else is experiencing hairs being shedded after 7 years worth of use,M,27,7  years1 1X D,6/14/2016Email,Propecia

2, 5, Slightly thinning hair,Only side effects from Propecia were Excessive Scalp hair growth,Anyone thinking that they're experiencing side effects while on propecia are delusional simply because propecia only targets a persons DHT levels and nothing else in the body. I started propecia at age 24 because I noticed a small amount of thinning hair at my hairline and my father was also Bald which made me panic about losing my hair and I took propecia for over 10 years and never experienced any negative side effects from it. In fact_ my hair grew so thick that I was always happy throughout the years and now at age 41 I've stopped taking propecia for a couple of years to see if I really needed to stay on it and my hair has been thinning excessively because of stopping propecia. After this experience that I'm having losing excessive hair has only made me aware that I can't ever stop taking it again...  ,M,41, 1 mg 1X D,4/13/2016,Propecia
3, 4, Hair Loss Prevention,Chest Pain on left side just under the heart from front to back.  This occurs only when asleep and never happens any other time.  It began about 5 years ago and has gradually gotten worse.  If I skip a day I have no pain that night's sleep so it is definitely the cause.,When I first started it I was beginning to lose hair.  I completely stopped losing  hair although the areas that had begun to thin did not regrow.  While my hair stayed exactly the same over the years my Brother_ who had a full head of hair then_ is now almost bald.  So it stops hair loss for sure_ but wondering what is it doing to me to cause this type of chest pain.,M,48,13  years1 MG 1X D,3/24/2016,Propecia
4, 1, Hair loss,Firstly_ before I explain the terrible side effects that I experienced while taking propecia_ I would like to state that I didn't notice any improvement in my hair line or even slowing of my hair loss during or after taking propecia. Propecia ruined my life.Propecia caused me to be suicidal depressed and lose the most important person in my life_ my girlfriend and life long partner of 7 years. By being extremely depressed_ I was impossible to live with and my career was also irreversibly damaged as I lost my motivation to work and my business fell apart. Physical side effects = decreased sex drive_ desensitised penis_ dulled orgasm_ increased fat in hip region and around nipples which looks unnatural as it is concentrated only in those two regions.,I would like to join the class action against propecia. The side effects are so apparent and severe. It is incredible that this drug was ever allowed on the market. The side effects continue and seem to come and go but remain part of my life 5 years after taking the pill.,M,37,5  months,1/20/2016Email,Propecia

Now i'm experiencing fatigue as well as erectile dysfunction. I'm also becoming a little depressed_ i don't know whether its work related or not. But the sexual side effects are serious.

During these times I had high libido _ frequency_ and an increase in the amount I ejaculate.,I felt I needed to go off propecia periodically a couple times per year to get it out of my system and then go back on with a small daily dose.

I take the pill at night so as to sleep during this period (which fades after 10hrs).,I tried various dosing routines: 1mg a day_ 1/2mg every 2 days_ 1/4mg every other day...  I could not take the drug regularly because of the headache issue but eventually settled on the 1mg per week (DHT does take 7 days to return to normal levels).  My advise would be is to give it a go and see what happens.  I have not lost any further hair in the last 2 years. Also check your vitamin D levels.,M,36,2  years1mg 1X W,4/26/2015Email,Propecia

24, 4, Thinning hair,Depression_ Anxiety_ Occasional Brain Fog. Personality is noticeably different to others_ but that may be due to stress.,"It has worked wonders for my diffuse hair loss- my thinning hair has noticeably filled in quite a bit_ to the point where many people have pointed it out. It is not completely filled in (I doubt it ever will be without Minoxidil)_ but it has made a large cosmetic difference and I feel much more confident/attractive. The medication has also restored my hairline from a Norwood 2.5-3 to a Norwood 2. I suffer no sexual side effects. My penis size has remained the same and my libido may have even increased in the last few months. Testicles are the same size and I have no problem getting an erection when needed. Finasteride has changed my personality_ however. I don't feel as excited or happy when good things happen- I guess I have become more ""apathetic"" to things. This may or may not a result of the drug. Additionally_ I am more anxious and sometimes depressed than I was before_ but that may be a result of stress from college/other things. The mental effects of Finasteride have easily been the worst part of taking this drug. My body hair is a somewhat more fine than it used to be. Facial hair remains the same though. Also_ my fat deposits have changed places; when I am bulking or gaining fat_ more appears on my ""love handles"" area than my abdomen where it used to. I'm not complaining about it_ but it is something I have noticed.",M,19,6  months1 MG 1X D,1/10/2015Email,Propecia

42, 1, Hair Loss,The very same day I began taking the medicine_ I started experiencing side effects in my testicles. It was an aching sort of pain_ one that you don't really feel when you are walking about and doing every day stuff. They were the first warning signs. I had to start skipping a day or two between daily dosages because the pain started to increase and so I began looking for similar experiences online and heard that it subsided after two weeks or so. Around 12-14 days of taking Propecia_ I started to notice that I wasn't getting morning wood any more_ I wasn't getting any solid erections_ and even those erections would produce a dribble of semen. The alarm bells were ringing. I feared that I was one of those very unlucky ones who react badly to the drug and end up with long term damage. After 17 days of the drug and my anxiety of having permanent damage at the age of 22 years old. I decided to stop taking the drug. Twelve days passed since I stopped the drug and none of my symptoms,It is a very tiny pill_ but it is a massively powerful drug. I was one of the lucky ones who managed to escape taking this drug without any long lasting side effects_ but that is probably due to the short time I was taking the drug. I spoke with my GP (Doctor) during the days after stopping the pill_ and he told me that there is a reason why doctors do not prescribe this drug for hair loss_ and why it is sold my businesses. They cash in on peoples' fears. Be very careful guys who are thinking of taking this drug. There are undoubtedly those who managed to use this drug in the long term with very successful results. But be warned_ this mistake could cost you your sex life for the rest of your days_ especially if you're young.,M,22,17  days1 mg 1X D,3/30/2014Email,Propecia

I developed the finasteride syndrome. I now suffer from severe insomnia_ depression and nervousness. I had to quot my lucrative career. It could possibly destroy you. I also suffered from the sexual symptoms as well. I also suffered many other symptoms including paranoia _ impaired vision tinnitus_ and many other psychological symptoms as well as body changes: increased fat deposits on chest and face area to name a few. These changes will occur over time for most people.  This drug is poison for the body. Dont risk it..!! I would rather be bald and penniless than take this drug..!

63, 2, Hair Loss,During the first couple of weeks I experience some weird visual sexual dreams. No other side affects observed over 3 years.,I started using Propecia in 1998 for hair loss. At the time I stopped using Rogaine and had switched to Propecia. I went from thinning hair to nearly completely bald in the three years. Propecia did little to stop my thinning hair. During that time I father my son who is now 11. Bright kid who is now entering puberty.

There is an ongoing lawsuit against the company who makes this and now everyone is trying to jump on the gravy train and collect. This drug works miracles and I still have *most* of my hair.  I have no doubt that there is a rare side effect of sexual dysfunction_ but the majority of these patients who have so-called sexual dysfunction after stopping the drug are just imagining things or trying to collect a paycheck.  It's in their head.  There is no scientific data that shows this drug has any mechanism to cause permanent sexual dysfunction.  Therefore I will keep using it.  I suggest you talk to your physician regarding this instead of listening to some money grubbers and/or mass hysteria on the internet.,M,35,3  years1 1X D,1/28/2013,Propecia
67, 5, Hair loss,My father was bald (male pattern) so as both of my grand fathers I was heading same direction. At the age of 21 I could actually see my scull on the top of my head. I started to take propecia roughly when I was 25-27 (can't really remember now) and still taking it every day. I had no side effects whatsoever. I have two children 2 and 4 years old both healthy and beautiful. Never had any issues with sex.

68, 1, Hairloss,BE VERY CAREFUL PEOPLE.   NO SIDE EFFECTS AT FIRST AND THEN BAM!!!!!    I took Propecia for 3 years with amazing results.  I was shocked at all the negative reviews.   I had zero side effects.    They suddenly - it hit me like a brick.   Inability to get an erection (only 30 years old)_ loss of sex drive_ inability to stay erect_ etc.   Went to the doctor and all tests were normal.   He suggested I go off propecia to see if it was related.   I stopped and two days later I was 100% back to normal.   Never again will I take this poison.   I was lucky_ my erections and drive came back --- many are not this lucky.   Hair is not worth losing your sex life people.    Stick with rogaine or laser combs.,Stay far away from this stuff.

69, 4, Balding,Some drop in semen quantity_ less morning erections_ somewhat dryer skin,I find it hilarious that people are surprised when some side effect happens after putting a drug in their system.Any intelligent person considering propecia will realize that it is going to effect your body in some way or another. You have to way the good with the bad and find the optimum dose for you. Even then it might not work. In my case I have found a good balance at .25mg where the sides are  virtually none existent. My hairloss is stable and I have actually seen some regrowth. I should add that the regrowth did not come until I added rogaine_ which same with propecia I had to find the right dose i could tolerate which ended up being once a day. My hairloss history: Started losing at 17_  norwood 3 by 24 and still in denial. Then suddenly the crown started going and that's when I took action. Plan too continue this drug until it my hair loss picks up or any side effects become noticeable. Know I will be bald one day soon_ but I have found I am caring less and less about this as I get older. Best of luck in whatever descion you choose.,M,27,3  years.25mg 1X D,1/9/2013Email,Propecia
70, 1, Hair Loss,Well the drug works and does slow/stop hairloss.   For me_ I had no side effects for 1 year (I am 32).   During the second year my erections started to not get as stiff.   Then the libedo slowed.   Then I would get full on impotence once or twice a week.  It scared the heck out of me so I tried stopping.   Everything returned to normal within 5 days of stopping.  I am me again and my erections are back and then some.,This drug is poison and the effects are not yet understood by doctors.  It caused impotence in me - someone who is a horny lover of sex.

Whenever I see a guy having depression_ anxiety attacks_ penile shrinkage etc. after days or weeks on propecia I'm just ROTFLOLing. Let me remind you people that Propecia by no means can be worse than castration. And castration has a long history in human kind. No history passages or medical documentation mentions that being castrated **** you up in any other way than taking away your sex life. Let's be serious now - Propecia is not castration_ it just blocks one hormone that hasn't been proven to do anything good in male organism after puberty except for body hair growth_ baldness on the head and prostate enlargement.,My shedding has now stopped and Im heading into regrowth period.

I experimented two different times by stopping my usage for three months and then started it up again to make sure the results were clear. Guess what?

I had my doctor look it up when I visited him_ as he takes Propecia and is starting to develop hearing loss as well now.I will tell you that 10-years ago I could hear a mousse fart.

113, 3, Hair Loss,Have noticed a few side effects_ nothing serious. At first I had decreases in amount semen which has gotten better (back to normal). Slight fatigue in the gym (can do what I did before but had to work back up to it).,At first I was noticed a few minor side effects but they mainly went away. The semen decrease stopped. Back to where I was at weight lifting. I did notice a very slight headache at first but it's not really an issue anymore. No ED_ or loss of libido (can j/o 3 or 4 times a day if i cared to and definitely hasn't slowed down my sex life). No brain fogginess (took the MCAT while on the drug and scored in the 93rd percentile). Have noticed the tricep twitch within the last three days actually. All in all I am not displeased with the drug so far. No major side effects. I am still in the shedding phase so I can't attest to its effectiveness or not but so far nothing has happened that would make me want to stop. I have found studies online and 5AR inhibition studies done that show .5 mg is just as effective as 1 mg which is also more cost effective. I started losing early (at 22) and even though some would consider it vanity_ I would like to finish up my 20's with hair. Sorry to hear some are having major problems.

I had minor side effects but if you asked me at year 4_ I would have highly recommended this drug.  Around year 5 I started having problems out of the blue.  Having sex for an hour or even a whole afternoon wasn't a problem_ then all of a sudden I had trouble lasting more than 2 minutes.  Sensation left_ I lost desire for sex and everything fell apart.  A year later and I'm very_ very slowly getting better but it's an up hill battle and I'm not sure I'll ever be my old self again.,Who would be stupid enough to risk permanent erectile dysfunction (documented in a Swedish medical study as well as recently in the United States and the subject of class action lawsuits in North America)?

Its been nearly four years.I am married and have never experienced any sexual side effects_ although the consistency of my semen tends to be more watery than before. I still have the same erection frequency as before I began taking this medicine. I have lab work done periodically because of the Lipitor I take for high cholesterol. My testosterone levels are normal. I have not noticed any breast tenderness or enlargement of any kind.,"I first asked my Dr about Propecia when I was 25. He discouraged me_ citing possible side effects_ my age_ and the price. At that point my hair was just beginning to thin on the top of my scalp. Hair loss was very gradual for the next several years. At about age 33 the hair loss accelerated. Friends and family were now starting to notice and comment on it; my scalp and hair loss were becoming very visible and apparent. I realized that going unchecked I would eventually have a bald spot about the size of my fist. I went back to the Dr at about age 34 and asked again about Propecia_ this time with a very thinning scalp. I took it as prescribed and also used Rogaine foam twice a day. In about 6 months my hair loss slowed noticeably. I would have been happy with just that (coupled with no serious side effects_ of which I had none); at least I would still have something to comb in the coming years. After about a year I noticed that the bald spot was getting smaller and the general area that was previously aggressively thinning (most of the top of my head) had more hair coverage. I do not have a ""full"" set of hair_ but I do have pretty good coverage_ although it is still thin in places. I am very content with this. My hair is now back to where it was when I was in my very early thirties. My kids have not commented on my hair loss in years. They seem to have forgot that I was going bald.

CANADIANS: SIGN UP TO PARTICIPATEhttp://www.kleinlyons.com/class/propecia-proscar/qualify.php,"Class action filed against manufacturer of Propecia & ProscarLawsuit filed for men who suffer sexual dysfunction after using hair loss drug.VANCOUVER_ Jan. 24 /CNW/- A class action was filed today in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by Vancouver resident_ Michael Miller_ against Merck Frosst Canada and its affiliated companies. The lawsuit has been brought on behalf of Canadian men who used Propecia or Proscar and suffered continuing sexual dysfunction.Propecia and Proscar are prescribed as a cosmetic treatment for male pattern hair loss also known as androgenic alopecia. The product monograph discloses that some men may experience sexual dysfunction but states that the symptoms disappear after cessation of the drug.Mr. Miller_ who is in his early 20s_ was concerned when his hair started to thin in some areas. He was prescribed Proscar which he hoped would stop his hair from thinning. After about a month of use he noticed a drastic change in his behaviour_ ""I lost my interest in sex and I felt anxious in social situations for no particular reason_"" he says. While on the drug_ his symptoms of sexual dysfunction increased as the months passed. When he could no longer bear the side effects_ he stopped using Proscar but these symptoms didn't go away: ""My sexual functioning has not recovered_ I have seen specialists and have tried treatments but nothing has worked_"" says Mr. Miller.According to Mr. Miller's lawyer_ David Klein_ &quo",M,33,1  years1.25mg 1X D,1/25/2011,Propecia

I had read all of these posts and thought that maybe if I only took half a pill every other day that I could avoid these side effects. FIrst off I will say that it did stop my hair loss. Even at that dose. I did occasionally get a numbness in my penis though. My ejaculation was a little less but not much. After 6 months I started getting a nervous twitch in my right tricep. It was like morse code. It was very precise twitches as if something was firing signals off. I knew it was the propecia and that my endocrine system was screwing up. Thats when I got scared and stopped. WIthin two days of stopping the muscle twitches that I had everyday for 6 weeks stopped. The fact is that if you're gonna go bald you are gonna go bald one way or another. Unfortunately theres nothing you can do about it thats safe.

130, 1, To slow down hair-loss,I started taking Propecia 4 years ago.  In the first year_ I noticed a slowing of hair shedding.  By the 3rd year it appeared that all of the early benefits were gone and hair-loss continued.  More importantly_ at least to me_ were the obvious physical changes that were ocurring in my body. The simple truth for me was that propecia has a big effect on your libido and your ability to get and maintain a real erection.  It totally diminished the quantity of ejection and basically took sex right out of my life. In addition_ it put a layer of fat around my stomach that was impossible to get rid of_ no matter how many sit-ups_ inclined tread-mill_ weight-lifting and dieting that I tried.  It also turned my rock-hard pecs into slighty puffy ones (breasts?). I know this was Propecia induced because it was a problem I never had before.  Being that I was 50 years old when I started Propecia_ I was fairly in tune with my physical well-being.The bottom line?  I know I might experience increased,Over the past few years I have frequently read comments on this web site.  I lied to myself whenever I read a negative commentabout Propecia's side effects.  I wanted to be a believer_ I wanted it to work_ and I didn't want to think I might be doing bad things to my body and to my libido.  Ultimately_ the inner voice in my head got the better of me.  I am sorry to take this position_ as I forced myself for 4 years to take this medication.  Sometimes in the morning I would get a bad feeling in my gut (metaphorically speaking)_ as if I knew that I was doing something that I really didn't feel right about.All I know_ is that after I stopped taking it_ things changed for the better.  My main concern still_ is that my quantity of ejaculation is still minute compared to pre-Propecia days.  I am hoping that all that returns.  At least my erections are getting back to normal.  I know each of you will have to make your own decision.  Maybe some of you are doing well on Propecia and have no sexual side effects.  All I know is that for me_ Propecia was_ in a sense_ castrating me chemically. That is how I feel and what I have written is an honest assessment of what I went through.,M,54,4  years1mg 1X D,9/7/2010Email,Propecia

It's ruining my life. For those skeptics who don't believe me_ go fck urself cuz i wouldn't lie in an anonymous forum.

I have not noticed the sexual side effects.,I started losing my hair a little over 1 year ago after getting on Wellbutrin. Within 3 weeks of taking it my head started itching and my hair started to fall out. I got off Wellbutrin but the hair continued to fall out. It turns out_ that the Wellbutrin triggered what was already supposed to happen_ but later in life. I wanted to get on Propicia right away but have a terrible history of sexual side effects while trying other drugs. Because of my past experiences and what I had read about the side effects of this_ I was scared away. For the next year I watched my hair fall out like rain. It was almost impossible to forget about it because the constant reminders were everywhere.  I had read that people had taken 1⁄4 the dose and it still worked almost as well. But I could find no posts about the side effects while taking the lesser dose. So I bought a pill slicer and tried it. Within 3 days my scalp stopped itching and my hair was not falling out near as much. Before_ if I were to run my fingers through my hair out would come at least 10 hairs. Now after three weeks it really seems to be almost back to normal_ in terms of hair loss. Too bad I didnt do this a year ago. I hope nothing changes and this will allow me to keep my hair until I am at least a bit older.,M,33,3  weeks.25 mg 1X D,7/27/2010,Propecia

Have always been a bit chubby_ but DID notice it was more difficult to stay lean while on propecia.,Have not noticed any of the other side effects_ except for weight gain and man boobs.  Went off the tabs for 2 months and my man boobs HALVED and I seemed to lean up without much effort - I work out a lot anyway.I am going to experiment with going off the tabs and then half tabs.

However_ tons of guys go bald_ and there would be tons more if men did try to hide behind propecia_ wigs_ transplants_ etc...moral of the story is men go bald_ women get fat.  I'd say maybe 30 percent of people naturally have obtained youthful good looks by the age of 30.  You are in control of how you perceive life_ so quit letting modern day society make you feel ugly or humiliated for going bald_ for they are retards.

Although the hair loss has slowly resuming_ I have decided to shave the hair with a very close cut and utilize 5% minoxidil and    trail/error with latisse on hard to treat areas.Even if I lose hair_ i would not take this drug again.  It caused desensitization of the penis_ inability to obtain/maintain erection_ loss of spontaneous erections_ and destruction of sex drive.Most men do not realize there is a problem until they either attempt sex or start to realize something is very severe or different.  The mild problems are harder to notice than the severe problems_ but they can be equally frustrating.Cessation of the drug during the past month has vastly improved --but not eliminated -- all of the sexual side effects.

I thought the side effects would sub-side_ but they didn't. So finally I stop taking the drug_ within a couple of month's time I noticed a huge increase in my sex-drive_ the brain fog was getting somewhat better_ and my joints have gotten some better.  Still I have the joint pain_ but not as  severally as I did. I have been off the drug for 3 years_ but I was still having some similar side effects.

After I stopped taking it_ brain fog stopped-didn't know this until my hormones balanced out again_ sex drive came back and thank God my sperm count returned to normal.  Our fertility doctor said if he would of know I was taking this product he would of told me to stop a long time ago-even though my dermatologist and family doctor said it was o.k. to use and dismissed our infertility to this product.

I have nothing to gain from warning people about propecia-and how it messed up my body.  For those that say well why didn't you stop taking it...I have to respond by saying if you took a little bit of poison each day would you really notice its effects or would you just attribute it to other things.  Truth is people will take it if they want to after being warned(my brother-in-law is a good example) because it works-no doubt but there will be issues and major ones.

That was the problem at the beginning.While wathcing porn i might not attached to it before as well for example_ Coz it sounds ridiculous to me sometimes.I mean I never fully enjoyed watching porn before_ too. I was always asocial before_ like now.So I can't decide if the problem is because of the drug or not. I always felt tired and rebel about life before taking this too.

I was concerned about long term stoppage for that reason and agree with another poster who advised getting your estrogen/testosterone levels measured as this drug definitely effects your hormone levels to a degree.

161, 4, Hair Loss,None.  These people complaining about bizarre side-effects are delusional.  They have read too many crazy posts and then imagine they feel the same way.  I first took Propecia for seven straight years without noticing a single side-effect.  The only side-effect I had heard about was the possibility of reduced libido so I went about my life and everything was fine and normal.  LIkewise_ when I temporarily stopped taking the drug for about two years_ I didn't notice any difference -- no withdrawal or anything.  And since starting Propecia again_ I likewise have no side-effects.  However_ being more attuned to signs of change after taking it the second time_ I did notice that my scalp and hair seemed a little more greasy and I had some acne on my scalp.  But those things quickly subsided.  During that period_ I felt like my scalp was coming back to life_ as if reinvigorated_ sensitive and tingly as the new hairs emerged.  I really believe the crazy claims of side-effects are psychological,"Propecia works. By age 26 my full head of hair had significantly thinned out.  My hairline had receded on the sides and I was thinning on the crown -- not a bald spot_ but scalp becoming visible.  So I got on Propecia.  I was amazed at the results.  Within just a few months_ the daily shedding ceased.  That was enough for me then_ so I kept on taking Propecia.  Over the next few years my hair actually thickened significantly and became much more healthy_ thick_ and full.  By the time I was 33_ I had a good head of hair and I received compliments on my ""good hair.""  At age 35_ I stopped taking the drug primarily out of laziness.  I went two years without taking Propecia.  The reversal is slow.  But I definitely lost a lot of hair and the quality decreased.  I regretted my decision to stop.  So I started taking it again.  Unsure if it would work as well the second time_ I am pleased to say that it appears similarly productive.  When I started back_ within a few months I had hundreds_ maybe thousands_ of small sprouting hairs on my scalp.  It's now ten months and I continue to have many new growing hairs.  It's really amazing and quite strange. When I brush my hair back_ it's like I have a totally different layer below.  Hopefully I will be back to where I was in another year or so.  I really think it takes about two years to get the full benefit.  It's a very effective drug and it perhaps changed my life during my late twenties and early thirties.

Before I took propecia I struggled with deppression.  I might not have noticed other side effects because my deppression causes all kinds of physical effects.

With my deppression beforehand I atleast cared about things in life but now I seem to care very little at all and just be moving through life.

These last problems brought me to a neurologist who did several tests including an MRI (normal).  No doctor suspected the Propecia.  I finally stopped taking it and noticed an improvement.  Then I would take it off and on_ and clearly saw the pattern of side effects that followed when I had taken the drug.

I tried rogaine several years earlier and not only was it messy to deal with_ I didn't see any results. Within a few months of taking propecia_ I noticed my hairloss had significantly decreased and had actually seen some new growth in the front portion of my head. Everything seemed to be going along fine until a little over a year ago. I started having problems that included dizzyness or off-balance feeling_ slurring words or speaking incoherently_ tired_ headaches_ night sweats. I saw every specialist in the book and was misdiagonosed with having inner ear problems_ migraines_ possible early signs of MS & very high anxiety.

He broke up with me last week because he doesn't feel attracted to me any more (he hasn't slept with anyone else and has masturbated twice in the last month_ so it's not just me!). He says he can't think of having sex with anyone at the moment. In addition to the sexual side effects he has become depressed_ demotivated and generally unhappy. He says he needs a break from me because he feels completely confused with everything going on in his life and doesn't want to be around other people. Whilst there are other factors which are the underlying problems_ he has only been like this since taking Propecia and I strongly believe the medicine is doing this. He is not the same person he was 6 months ago. He thought it was me who had changed but luc,well_ his hair has stopped falling out_ but I think most people would rather be happy and healthy_ and have their partner back to normal.,M,24,6  months,8/31/2007,Propecia
222, 5, Hair Loss,Mild decreased libido.,I have been on Propecia since 2003 (4 years).  I have regrown almost all of my hair to include the front (forehead area) which Propecia claims will not regrow.  I still have some thinning on the crown_ but much better than it was.  My sex drive is somewhat decreased_ but nothing unmanageable.  Also_ I have had two kids while on the drug with now sperm count issues.,M,28,4  years,8/23/2007,Propecia

224, 1, I was balding since I was 15 y.o.,"Huge decrease in sex drive_ it's basically non-existent; when I do orgasm there's barely any sensation_ it's basically no orgasm at all; a few small droplets of semen weakly bubble out_ before Propecia a bigger load would shoot out; grew female breast tissue (""Man boobs"")_ also starting to get very soft female like lower abdomen fat around midriff_ it's giving me a womanly shape.",This stuff is poison!  I want to sue the pants off Merck for lying to everyone that this wasn't that dangerous (it's b.s.!)!  But mainly I just hope and pray that some day I will become half the man I used to be.  This stuff is unbelievably scary and will alter your life forever!  I'm suicidal b/c of the side effects.  I was on it for nine months and everything was fine then all of a sudden the aforementioned side effects hit me and I was terrified.  I stopped Propecia cold turkey almost two years ago (after using it religiously for nine months) and not one of the side effects has gotten better at all!  I'm thinking of killing myself b/c I'm no where near the man I was before this absolute poison!  DO NOT TOUCH THIS TRASH!  I don't know how Merck's executives can sleep at night realizing what they've done to so many balding men.  I repeat: PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS POISON_ it is not worth it!,M,35,9  months,8/14/2007,Propecia

227, 2, Thinning hair,Slowed the balding process considerably. Prolonged use caused dull pain in my prostate that would be bad one day but not noticeable the next. Anxiety_ panic_ and depression. My doctor never informed me of any of these symptoms and to his knowledge he's never heard of any of them. GPs are not informed about this medication. I do believe that Propecia worked for me but I have no doubt that it left me for the worse. I got 7 more years out of my hair that I probably wouldn't have without it but.. I used to have quite a few sad depressing days (for no reason) when taking this but never thought it had anything to do with Propecia.,I stopped October 2006 (due to funds) and got my first HUGE panic attack in January 2007 and had anxiety/panic disorder since. Again_ I never thought it had anything to do with Propecia until after somewhat recovering from this anxiety (without medication) I decided to start Propecia again. WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE!!! Right after the first pill I felt panicked and anxious and it's been getting worse (I only took the 1 pill). That's when I looked for info about it. Propecia screws with some chemicals in your brain that could cause you to feel or develop anxiety/panic/depression. If it's screwing with your head who knows what prolonged use (7 years)will mean and do you really want to be putting this in your body? The gamble is NOT worth it! Just be a man about going bald: keep your hair short_ go to the gym_ and try improving what really counts: YOUR PERSONALITY!,M,37,7  years,6/29/2007Email,Propecia

I have erectile problems with some women_ but not others_ and I think this is not due to propecia,The drug has definitely slowed hair loss and kept my bald spot from growing much. Much less hair in the bathtub. No side effects - I'm puzzled by the hysterical posts about this.  My big gripe is the cost - the price has gone up_ not down.

Ill think about sad things for no reason even to the point of crying_ its pretty strange and something that i never used to do.,id say theres enough anecdotal evidence to show that propecia does cause more side effects than Merck claims_ and these problems seem to persist after stopping propecia for some men.

I wanted to kill myself for no reason. I was not anxious about my hair at the time and I wasnt even thinking about the propecia causing anything becase it was just to regrow hair_ and the listed side effect was sexual. 1 year later I went on my first antidepressant_ and my life has never been the same. I have taken propecia on and off now for 10 years_ and overall I think it did slow my hairloss down_ but didnt stop it. My depression got so bad that I had to take a leve of abscense from work. I stopped taking proecia about a year ago and the depression subsided over time.

At first it really did work amazing. I couldn't believe the new hair that was coming in on my crown. At about 10 months everything changed. My errections became weak and eventually I was unable to even get hard_ even with a sex drive. The brain fog set in as well.

Why do I KNOW this? because I had no problems for TWENTY YEARS_ then I take proecia_ and WHAM_ days later I start having problems. Why didn't I stop taking it the moment I noticed the side effects? Because my doc said I should allow my body some time to adjust to the drug. And because ALL side effects were suppose to go away once I halted its use.

There are so many guys that have similar problems with this drug on here and i find it very hard to beilieve that its in their heads. This drug has only also been only out for the past 10 yrs_ so the long term damage hasn't been discovered yet.

244, 5, male pattern baldness,None - just to add_ better wood than before. This is more than likely a psychological reaction to having better self esteem than any physiological action of the drug.,sorry to double post_ just to add to my previous posts. Propecia does have very active ingredients. If you're still developing your secondary sexual characteristics_ etc. dont take the drug. It is a DHT blocker - thats what it does. No one but you will know exactly when your penis stops growing_ but the generally accepted figure is between 18-20. It would be very wise to wait until then before you take the plunge. Before then_ try minoxidil or something else.So far a very happy chappy - going out on a date in a couple of hours ;),M,22,30  days,4/18/2007Email,Propecia

Its hard for people without hair loss to understand just how big a deal it is when you're young_ and in the prime of your life. SO I tried propecia. It is doing wonders. hair shedding has dropped dramatically_ and i actually at least look like i have a full head of hair. self esteem up 1000%.

272, 1, hair loss,loss of sex drive_ impotence_ erectile dysfunction_ gynocemastia (make breasts)_ depression_ anxiety_ decreased ejaculate_ numb penis/scrotum_ penis curvature and penis/scrotum shrinkage... the list goes on. If you start this drug_ get baseline blood tests before doing so!!! These include: T_ DHT_ Free T_ LH_ FSH_ TSH_ Prolactin_ Estradiol_ Coristol_ DHEA-S... more info on www.propeciahelp.com,PAY ATTENTION: I took this drug for 11 months. I still had a sex drive while on it_ it was just very weak. Same goes for erections_ semen output etc. AFTER I QUIT_ EVERYTHING WENT TO HELL. 2 WEEKS after quitting my sex drive shot up due to rebounding DHT_ but tanked afterwards due to my Testosterone levels CRASHING. 18 months off I still have no sex drive_ difficulty getting hard_ genital numbness etc. AND LOW T. YOU DONT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU QUIT THIS DRUG SO DONT THINK YOU'RE OUT OF THE WOODS WHILE YOU'RE ON IT.

273, 1, Hair loss,Fatigue_ left testicle pain_ pressure feeling in prostate_ watery ejaculate_ excessive loss of libido_ funny feeling in my throat....fatigue_ and I think some weight gain.  I took the drug for a little more than a month...... loss of libido came on quickly and ramped up... increased to become nearly non-existant... I stopped the drug three days ago and the testicular pain and pressure is already gone..(I started taking saw palmetto when I stopped the drug)....other symptoms appear to be resolving too.......to soon to fully tell_ but I already have more energy......,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG:  Yes_ hair-loss seems to have stopped and resoration seems to have started_ but it's not worth it.  Fiance checked my scalp every few days and reports significant increase in new hair growth....she was surprised too_ but doesn't like the side effects either..... I can also see hair increase in the mirror too..... but due to side-effect_ wasn't sure it was the drug_ but the testicular pain worried me.  Now I know.  I'm done with this stuff and I don't believe the 2% hype........ If you are lucky enough to have found this forum believe what you are reading here...... I think this drug is dangerous and sorry I had to learn the hard way...... feelings in my genitalia already seem to be changing so I hope I caught it in time..... I've only been on it a little over a month.......and pity the guys who have been taking it for years.......... I fully expect this drug to be withdrawn by the FDA before long...... DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG_ PLEASE.,M,60,45  days,3/13/2007Email,Propecia
274, 5, Hair loss,At first_ there were no side effects.  Now_ after taking the drug for nearly 5 years_ I've realized that I've essentially lost my sex drive.  I can get an erection but never climax.  This has caused tension with girlfriend.  Also_ I have decreased ejaculate.  I am worried this will affect my ability to have children.  I also have begun treatment for depression and anxiety.,It worked wonders for stopping hair loss.  My older brother has not taken Propecia and he has complete loss on his crown and receding hair line.  I started once I noticed the recession.  I have not receded any more and no loss on the crown.  I've had people say my hair looks thicker.  However_ now that I am older and in a committed relationship_ I am thinking of quitting based on teh sexual side effects.,M,27,5  years,3/12/2007,Propecia
275, 1, for mpb,this drug messed up everything inside my body. after taking this disaster i have never felt normal again. i lost my sexual desire_my energy_my mental clarity. i have gained additional 13 kilograms while on that drug. i have stopped it for 6 months till now; though i still lack alot of my energy and libido. 6 months and counting_ and still no okay. yes i want to spare my hair_but not on the account of my life.,,M,27,60  days,3/9/2007Email,Propecia
276, 1, receding hair line,pretty bad acne (considering i hever had acne as a teen) acne began as blackheads on forehead..progressed to more severe acne on cheeks.  slight loss of sexual desire and changed hair texture to coarse and dry,don't take it unless you REALLY need it - and even then consult with more than one dr. i just quit a few days ago and hope and pray none of the side effects are long lasting...i should add that people did take notice that my hair looked thicker(but i don't care for thick coarse_ unmanageable hair_ i prefer my slightly receding hair line to that and acne_ and loss of sexual desire),M,29,8  months,3/2/2007,Propecia

278, 4, rapid thinning of hair,I have noticed a rapid decrease in sex and problems getting erection and having orgasm during it.  Depression is another strong factor. but nothing that ruins your life. testicle pain but rare. Still have not seen re-growth but hair quality has increased and stopped falling out so rapidly,There is no point to get on here and bash this drug. It is helping thousands of men with hair problems_ and the few of you white trash people bashing it are just lame.  You may have a problem but that doesnt mean others will.

281, 5, Hair Loss,I have not experienced any side effects.,This drug is great. About a month and a half of taking it_ I could really notice a difference in my hair thickness. Before taking the drug_ many of my friends would comment on my hair thinning; now nobody ever comments about my hair negatively. My doctor said 5% of men who take the drug experience a decrease in libido_ but there's always a risk with any drug.,M,23,6  months,2/10/2007,Propecia
282, 5, hair loss,during the first few months_ there was a decrease in my sexual urges.  But since_ I was aware of it because my dermatologist explained why it happens_ and it will eventually stop when i continue_(she even advised viagra_ thank you!)_i took it  .  I am already on my 2nd year and so far_ the side effects have already subsided. I had my hair back_ i could see it coming out. And every three months I went back to my dermatologist to have my hair checked. I am just thankful becuase it brought back my self esteem ( I used to be always joked upon becuase of that).  It worked for me and my wife loved it.,I have gone across an ad ProHAIR. I called the number and they have told me to consult a dermatologist. If you want to take the pill_ you must consult your dermatologist first_ they know what is best for treating hair loss_ will give you a better understanding on what happens with our hair and explain how the pill works.  If you are experiencing the side effects especially on the first few months_ there are drugs like viagra to address the concern. I took propecia to regain my hair and it did_ it answered my problem. I am just glad it worked for me.,M,31,2  years,2/7/2007,Propecia

284, 2, hair loss,My husband has been taking propecia for apprx. 5 years now.  Our entire family has notice a very distinct difference in his personality and I have notice his almost complete lack of libido.  My husband is the last person I would ever expect to have an anger problem but since taking propecia he has become a time bomb.  Extreme rage_ foaming at the mouth when he reaches his peak of outrage.  Extreme verbal abuse and two physical outbursts to our children.  He will not stop taking propecia because it does work - but at what cost? Help.,,F,47,5  years,1/30/2007Email,Propecia
285, 1, Hair Loss,Loss of sex drive_ curvature of penis_ coagulated ejaculate and in some cases towards the end (brown - blood mixture).  After discussing these issues with my urologist - he immediately suggested to cease taking this product.,I was on Propecia for just shy of 4 years.  I am in my mid-30s and started noticing after about 6 months that my sex-drive was gone and that my penis started bending and even worse shortening and becoming thinner in mass.  Embarrased to say_ I have measured my erections from time-to-time_ but can honestly and accurately say I have lost 1 5/8 inches in length and 1/2 in diameter during full erection.  I am now 3 months off and drive is coming back but size is not.  What a horrible mistake.  Please DO NOT TAKE this drug.  With age comes wisdom - I now realize going bold is a better alternative than feeling less than adequate with the opposite sex.,M,35,4  years,1/28/2007,Propecia
286, 4, Stop male pattern baldness,I have experienced no side effects after using for 2 years.  I am 24 now_ but I am concerned about potential side effects.,I'm not entirely sure if my hair has grown back or stopped falling out.  When I run a come through my hair_ a large amount still comes out_ which I think is normal in men not experiencing male pattern baldness.  However_ at 24 years old_ I have to think to the future.  Being bald sucks_ but what sucks more; baldness or the inability to reproduce?  If I continue to use this drug for 10 years_ what then?  I think I should stop before I experience some of the horros I have read on this page.  You can email me at Jeff@WorldSeriesTicketSecrets.com if you would like to discuss this.,M,24,2  years,1/24/2007Email,Propecia
287, 1, hair loss,no sex drive_ lack energy to work out_ chronically tired,after talking too many people & reading I finally decided to get off propecia. im only 28 and can't even get hard.  i got on viagra and that somewhat helped--but not the same. my life is over--i cant believe doctors still recommend this stuff. merck must be giving them some nice kick backs,M,28,3  years,1/23/2007,Propecia
288, 4, hair loss,I am not sure about all of the side affects_ but I am sure about the fact that my penis is not as large as it once was.  My penis is not as erect as it once was and I have lost about three inches in length and some in girth.  I also feel tired a lot and my head feels cloudy all the time.,Propecia has some side effects_ but it does work. When I started taking it I did stop losing hair and I even grew back most of what I lost. As of now I will continue taking Propecia simply because I do not know of any other drug that works.,M,25,5  years,1/21/2007,Propecia
289, 4, hairloss,Slight ache in genitalia. Went away pretty quickly after the first few weeks. Other than that it INCREASED my sex drive. I regained alot of my hair in conjuction with minoxidil. I didn't get boobs or anything_ but then I work out almost everyday.,Worked for me_ but its too expensive. You can buy generic proscar for less than 10$ a month if you do a little research. Its the real deal too_ I wont advertise any sites because I dont want anyone to discount my comments. The price of propecia is one a huge ripoff. Your prescription costs like 65/month its costs to produce that like 3 dollars or something. Good luck.,M,28,7  months,1/18/2007,Propecia

Also notice weaker ejaculation.,I'm just going to have more transplants.  Maybe try the foam rogaine.  I don't think I want to risk growing boobs_ or scaling back on the sex drive.

292, 1, Hair Loss,After five years taking the drug I started to experience a loss of sexual appetite and difficulty obtaining an erection or maintaining an erection for the duration of sex. This before reading various negative reports on-line which will no doubt have exacerbated any concerns.,I am the first to be dubious of 'forum science' and have been unable to find one report of irrecoverable sexual disfunction written by someone who writes like they made it through college. However_ I am convinced that Propetia had an effect on my labido and caused some sexual disfunction. Needless to say_ I stopped taking it and hope for the full recovery mentioned on the medical information inside the pack.,M,31,5  years,1/10/2007,Propecia
293, 1, Hair loss / general thinning,I am a 60 year old woman who loved Rogaine for women but became allergic to it.  Because I am well past child bearing years_ my doctor prescribed Propecia 1.5 months ago.  My hair loss has slowed but I don't see any new growth yet.  I was pleased until I finally figured out that my sexual dysfunction in the past month is associated with when I started Propecia.  After reading all these descriptions of male dysfunction_ I'm not taking it any more either.  I first thought my new inability to climax was age related and now I'm sure it is beause of Propecia.,,F,60,1.5  months,1/8/2007,Propecia
294, 5, Hair thinning,"I experienced the ""Panic Attack"" symptom_ about one month after starting up the drug-after another full month it wore off.  It was an amazing_ deeply negative experience.  As a result_ I have more sympathy for people who have side effects from drug treatment.  Anyway_ I haven't grown new hair_ but the hair that I had_ which was thinning_ has been completely revitalized.  I will never regrow what I permanently lost_ but I plan to stay on the drug until age 45_ or maybe age 50_ before I consider discontinuing.  For me_ the Finasteride has stopped my hair from thinning to the point where my scalp is clearly visible_ and that's good enough for me.  My results are identical to the ""Blake"" guy on the main Propecia page.  If I had started this drug at age 35 (currently 37)_ my hair would probably be next to perfect_ as I started the drug before any major hair loss occurred with me.","Use it at your own risk-it is not for everyone_ as I do know someone else personally who had their libido destroyed-and this is a married male I know who was angry that his body wasn't ""Propecia-compatible.""

I don't live with him and I only see him over the weekend_ however he doesn't seemed to be eager to have sex with me during the weekend.  I have to ask for sex which is sometimes only once in a month.  I pointed out once he must been having the sexual side effects but he said our relationship is fine_ I think way too much.  He shrugged off my suggestion of stop taking the pills.  Recently I convinced him to go see the doctor but I am afraid he won't stop taking the pills.  I feel I had enough.. I had attached the reasons for his loss of libido to many other aspects of his life like job stress_ alchohol and the maturity of the relationship.  I sincerely believe he is having the chemical castration.  I love him very much but it is time for me to end the relationship and move on.

I haven't experienced any side effects_  I'm very athletic - I work out 5 times a week packing on muscle_ my sex life hasn't changed with any of my partners in the 3 years.  I've tried monoxidil but for some strange reason that made me dizzy so i got off it in a week.,it has helped to slow down and reduce the thinning of my hair.  my hair seems to be similar to what it was 3 years ago - but i think if i haven't taken it my case could have been worse.,M,25,3  years,12/19/2006Email,Propecia
300, 5, Hair Loss,I've been taking it for 5 years_ and something is wrong.  I can't be sure it is Propecia (I'm going to stop use today)_ but I have no sex drive at age 35.  I have been a bit hazy_ too_ the last 6 months in particular.  Not sure_ need coffee to stay somewhat alert and in general a feeling like I just woke up all the time.  I thought it was maybe depression or perhaps my asthma and allergies (asthma triggers fatigue)_ but these conditions have never affected my sex drive or ability to hold an erection.  It's to the point where I'm bearly aroused anymore and/or doubting myself every time I get close with my girl.,Five years ago_ I had mad sex_ and was confident and focussed.  I can't tell how much my lack of confidence and focus is because propecia_ or just plain depression_ but I'm not depressed all the time_ so I wonder about this.  I want to keep my hair_ but I must feel what it's like to really have great sex  again.  It's now a problem with my girlfriend_ and I wonder what is wrong with me.

302, 2, Thinning hair,I just came of this drug a week ago and started to feel better within a few days. I have been on propecia for 10 months and started to feel the side effects within days_ loss of libido_ some headache etc_ what most guys are saying. I started to take a quarter of a pill of viagra sometimes_ that helped. But with the hair_ there was some shedding in the beginning but that soon stopped and I basically kept my hair for the time period. The sex was not spontaneous_ needed lots of stimulation. However the last few months other symptoms started_ panic attacks_ dizziness_ fog brain etc._ also discovered man boobs. It's not worth it_ I think this drug affects everyone differently. I had to drink alot and take sleeping pills just to go to sleep some nights_ my mind was racing so much. I still tend to drink more at night_ to take the edge off. Normally_ I would exercise_ but that just made it worse. Ocasionaly_ even during the day_ I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. then it would go,I think that it is still in testing phase_ maybe it is too strong and has to be adjusted to each person's chemical makeup. Anyway im 44 and have a wife that would love me with or without hair.,M,44,10  months,12/8/2006,Propecia
303, 3, Stop Hairloss_ regrow some,I have been taking Propecia for about 1.5 years now and unlike some people on this board i dont want to exagerate the side effects_ after about 4 months of taking the drug my hair suffered alot of shedding_ like bucket loads of hair on my pillow in the morning and everytime i ran my hands through my hair a couple oh hairs would come off like off the bangs especially_ it really freaked me out but i stuck with it coz i was told this was normal_ so i persisted and my hair did seem to improve after about a year_ it looked more healthy and slightly thicker..but now after about 1.5 years ive noticed a few things like bitch tits_ (this was very gradual but it does happen) i lift alot of weights and gym work and even having a low body fat percentage my bitch tits still kinda remained there_ i know for a fact they wernt like that before coz ive been bulking and cutting a LONG time....,anyway ive also noticed my hair (which is brown) has kinda lost its pigmentation_ its hard to explain but its lost its color and just looks not blonde nor grey and the actual diameter of each individual strand is soooo fine its unbelievable_ it was NEVER like that before_ im very observant when it comes to these things and YES all my hair is basically still there_ but this product does not help at the temples if you think it will_ think twice about taking it...but it definately helps keep the hair on the crown...the price is hair with no pigmentation_ fine diamter hair which is EXTREMELLY difficult to style_ i have to pump a shit load of product into it to make it thicker_ like hair spray etc so i can make it look respectable and spike it etc...I also have errection problems_ but i also read another writer say they have become more horny_ i actually agree with that...im wayyy more horny but i just cant get it up! and at 28 that is very embaressing....anyway im thinking of going of it f,M,28,1.5  years,12/3/2006,Propecia

I'm not taken any other medication at all and I consider my self a helthly and athletic guy. I gave it a 3 because I haven't seen any new hair and because it is quite expensive. However_ I keep using it because at least I feel that I've kept the same amount of hair during this year.

305, 1, Hair loss,I started asking my wife why sex wasn't the same anymore.I thought it was her_ but I just couldn't figure out what was happening.I finally lost my ability completely to get an erection_ and my sperm went chunky. I took this medicine for about 2 years and it has messed up my relationship with my wife completely. I have been off for over a year and still struggle with having no desire for sex. I have a beautiful wife of 25 years and have to force myself to think about having sex every couple of weeks.I am terrified I won't get an erection or if we have forplay that my erection will hold on for more than a few minutes. I finally tried a natural suppliment from an on-line health food store and it helped a lot_ but I don't like taking the two pills every day and sometimes get nosebleeds from the medication. Does anybody know if this can be reversed? I am 46 years old and wonder what I will be like 10 years from now. Please - DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG EVER!

307, 3, Hair Loss,The usual side effects i guess_ lowered libido_ hasn't effected the performance at all though_ am better in the sack than I have ever been. Puffy nipples / slightly more chest fat....had estrogen levels checked however and all cool_ so not really worried. Definately get some anxiety  however. I have a theory that finasteride exhasbirates the effects of any underlying anxiety disorder (have heard figures like 1 in 10 have one). I have cut back from 1.25 mg to .625 mg / day and seems to have helped. All the mental sides mentioned here are indicative of anxity,I would be really interested to hear from anyone that has long term studies on this drug and also anyone that has reduced dosage like me to reduce sides. I should probably add that it does work a treat on the hair....I have more hair now than when i was 18 and am far more confident etc (when not suffering the effects of anxiety :-(. Also think that this drug exhasbiartes the anxious effects of a hangover. Would be interested to hear from others about this facet also....cheers_ Steve,M,28,2  years,11/19/2006Email,Propecia
308, 3, ,"Now let me say.. that since i started losing my hair (age 21) I've been down and depressed.. and very anxious... but i still had girlfriends and a strong sex drive... Fast forward to now... and I barely have an ejaculation.. my penis feel smaller... and ""distant"".. I never have morning erections... and have a tough time getting aroused unless Im with a girl... otherwise my erection is weak and hard to keep... Let me also add that I havent been with nearly as many girls as I was before I took this stuff... Now i always thought that was because i now have a low self esteem due to my lack of hair (even with Propecia) but Im now beginning to think i have no libido.. Im like a homo around women... I'm passive_ and quiet_ and feel no strong sexual urge like i did in the past... As others have said.. I basically dont have an appropriate sex drive... I feel like a old man in 24 year old body... It's terrible... Add to this that I have no energy_ occasional tenderness in my balls_ and",and these penis side effects certainly dont help the self esteem... I dont know what to do though.. if i stop taking it Im gonna be bald at 24 and thats not a good look for me...Maybe I should just cut back to a half pill and look into a transplant.. Anyway... if your a young guy going bald or thinning like i was at 21... avoid this stuff... Use Rogain_ and buy some Toppik which is a very good concealor and makes your hair look a helluva lot thicker (at least in my case)... And if that isnt good enough... throw down the money for a good transplant...

310, 3, Hair loss,Hi__ thanks for all the input_ This was a breath of fresh air to read___ I noticed so many things different about me_ but never associated it to Propecia_ although I did suspect the changes in me over years of use  may have been from the drug_ I wasnt sure? I experienced loud ear ringing_ loss of motivation_ indecisiveness _ teeth clenching _ and a lost feeling_ Because I thought it may have been from Propecia_ I did quit taking it for a month or so_ = no change. So I went back on it_ I looked up the side effects_ and nothing seemed to stack up to what I was experiencing. I did however notice that the more I smoked cigarettes_ the worse the symptoms that I was experiencing got. So I quit Smoking. Things got much better right away_ Everything in me went back to normal_ except for motivation.? After reading this today_ Im not sure what I think_ but to me it was a combination between Nicotine and Propecia. I will be re-thinking all that this information has applied.  ,,M,50,6  years,11/6/2006,Propecia

I agree with most of the comments posted here; chronic ""cold-shower"" penis_ significantly lowered ejaculate volume and abnormal semen consistency_ supressed libido_ aching testicles_ and shrunken prostate which caused my prostatitus (urine urgency and incontinence). DHEA_ an andro-hormone_ which can be obtained over the counter or at GNC-type stores_ is the antidote.  Within hours of taking 25mgs_ my symptoms completely disappeared.

Stopped hair loss BUT:  persistant acne of the scalp; increased stomach acidity; mental foggyness; male breast enlargement; exercise demotivation; shrunken unstimilated penis; bald spots on facial hair areas (lower face and neck); disturbed sleep; increased urinary frequency and discomfort; changes in sensitivity to alcohol and caffeine.,In consideration of the apparently extensive side-effects not listed by the manufacturer nor the FDA_ be sure to weigh your desire to halt your hair loss against the probability of experiencing these_ and possibly other_ side effects.  I know it would have changed MY decision to go on this drug!  After all_ no legal judgement against the manufacturer will alter the permanency of these side effects for YOU!,M,41,4  years,7/2/2006Email,Propecia
353, 5, HAIR LOSS,Im 21 Ive only been taking propecia for a month and havent noticed any increase in hair but it sees to have stoped shedding. In terms of side effects there is no question that Im more horny than ever. Looking at a picture of an average female gets my heart racing. Ejaculation and erection unchanged. However Im having mild stomach aches ever day and Im quite sure its from the drug. Ill keep you posted.,this drug was recommended to me by a friend who is 22 and he claims to have had no side effects_ so i am hopeful. if they hair remains unchanged from now and the stomach aches subside_ the libido increase alone will be worth it,M,21,1  months,6/28/2006,Propecia
354, 2, Hair Loss,Loss of sex drive and libido_ breast tissue growth_ strong pain in right side... possibly kidney pain_ muscle loss_ still losing some hair.,Propecia seems to have kept some hair but I am still losing it. The side effects are not fun. I am worried about losing hair but I might just stop taking this drug because between growing breasts and having serious pains in my side_ it's starting to not be worth it.,M,29,2  years,6/28/2006,Propecia
355, 3, thinning hair,I started feeling Anxiety and having panic attacks during everyday life situations. Fear of public speaking/social engagements led to some depression and lots of sleep problems.,I started at age 22 and the drug really worked for my hairloss.  However_ the anxiety and panic attacks really effected me.,M,28,6  years,6/27/2006,Propecia
356, 3, Hairloss,Decreased Libido_ watery sperm_ Panic attacks (Badly)_ foggy brain_ poor memory_ testicular pain_ depression.,For hair it worked great after about three years hair started thinning again_ switched to Minoxidil and my hair grew back. I think cycling between the two is the best approach_ though I will never use propecia again it made my life hell.,M,36,5  years,6/21/2006Email,Propecia
357, 3, Hair Loss,A slight enlargement of breasts. Worse problem is inceased anxiety. Now I have intestinal problem that I am currently going to doctor for to figure out. I have loose stool ALL the time. Somewhat uncontrollable bowel movements. Very uncomfortable in public and starting to effect my work as I am a travelling salesman. Anyone else having this problem?,My doc asked me to stop for 1-2 months to see if my stomach gets better. I think I will do that and used ROgaine. If I start loosing my hair really noticably again_ I may move to taking 1/2 pill and see if that does anything. If not_ I will quit altogether and save my $70 a month for hair replacement.,M,32,14  months,6/11/2006Email,Propecia
358, 1, Hair loss,Within 1 month_ I had a blackout at my computer and had intense dizziness_ fatigue_ brain fog and also the painful testicle and depression. Have paid thousands of dollars getting lots of tests_ to be told I have chronic fatigue syndrome. It has been over 1 year since I got those side effects_ and I'm not better. I would be interested in talking to others who wish to make a class action law suit. It has totally ruined my life and I'm glad to see that others are stating what has happened to them. I didn't think it was the Propecia doing the damage_ ans so only gradually stopped taking it_ but too late the damage was done....,Do not take this medicine - it may work for a small number of people_ but it seems the side effects far outweigh the potential benefits. My personal experience is one of great suffering and hope that no others have to suffer the endless nightmare of no energy_ depression_ constant dizziness...,M,28,5  months,6/11/2006Email,Propecia
359, 5, hair loss thinning,Well after reading most of the listings_ I agree on most of the comments here. I was really worried about before I taking this drug and did a lot of research before I took this drug as I am believer of taking drug can change your body and it will ended up long term suffering. Well_ It didn't failed me. I had moody feeling and felt like i was getting homosexual(gay). Had really bizzare feeling and I felt this drug changes my hormon into something that is not me.,Yes. I had regained my hair after taking for about 4month I gave it up because of side effect and turned back to minoxidil which is less risky than PROPECIA. It helped a bit but it wasn't the cure for temple hair loss. But I felt much better after 1year stop taking profecia and am slowly changing back to what I was. Healthy active guy!My rating is 5 because you will not see my adivce if it's at the bottom. anyway choose it carefully and don't risk youself. getting bald is not attractive but better than being gay~!,M,24,4  months,5/26/2006,Propecia
360, 1, thinning/thin hair,dramatically decreased libido_ erectile disfunction near to the point of impotence possibly breast elargment(though i have been eating more lately) decrease in cum volume_ testicular pain during and after sex,made my girlfriend of 2 years very unhappy... for the last two months i thought i wasn't attracted to her any more even though i know i am! i didnt know what was wrong with me_ i am going to stop taking it,M,22,4.5  months,5/18/2006,Propecia
361, 3, hair loss,Libido decrease.  Panic attacks,I have defenitely seen a big decrease in my sex drive after 2 years.  I'm getting off of this shit and hope it returns.  Erections are OK although I think it's a small issue as well.,M,32,2  years,5/16/2006,Propecia
362, 3, Hair Loss,In the first few weeks I noticed lots of acne poping up everywhere. It did eventually go away. Another side effect I have been having is a dull ache in my prostate.,Conisendtly I have found that having anal sex with makes the pain in my prostate go away. I think the thrusting in in out of my ass massages the prostate and keeps the pain at bay.,M,22,9  months,5/15/2006,Propecia
363, 1, Hairloss,The side effects were like day and night. Before starting Proscar I was sharp_ witty_ an avid reader and full of ambition. Two weeks after taking the medication getting out of bed was a challenge. I turn from bookworm to movie buff as books are too challenging and I have to re-read everything 1000 times. I find myself dozing into space_ but not only in appropriate situations (on the bus_ at home alone) but with friends_ at parties/clubs! I also become severely depressed and even felt myself turning into a bit of a nihilist. Life just seemed completely redundant. When I stopped the medication (after 3 months in the summer of 2004) things got better but I'm far from the way I was before taking it. I'm 22 and feel like my mind had been aged by 40 years. I watch my grandma at 87 zone out at family functions and get exhausted in a few hours of socializing and hate that I can actually relate to her. Before taking proscar I had a limitless amount of energy..Does anyone have advice as to what,As much as I hate this product and cannot even begin to fathom how it was given the green light by the FDA_ I'm not going to lie. It did benefit my hairloss. However_ as much as I wanted to credit the side effects to something else_ they were undeniable. I quite the medication after 3 months and lost the hair I grew. I didn't lose much_ however_ as 3 months isn't really long enough to grow much hair back anyway.,M,22,3  days,5/15/2006Email,Propecia
364, 1, Hair Loss,Side effects were pain in my testicles that started after a couple of months taking it.  Seemed to keep my genitals in the state of feeling as if they had been in cold water.  Loss of sex drive_ difficulty getting erections_ loss of semen.,Though I wasn't on it long.  The side effects were painful and embarrising.  Not worth the money to put up with that.  Probably does work for hair loss to an extent_ but again_ not worth the terrible side effects.,M,28,4  months,5/12/2006,Propecia
365, 4, general hair loss,I can't believe people who say the sexual side effects are you in your head... come'on_  that's like saying the Hair Re-growth is just imagination (for goodness sake).    Sexual side effects are a definite_ it's harder to have an erection_ keep an erection_ and ejaculate.  Meanwhile it does work for hair soooo ehh?,SEVERAL of my friends with excellent results only take 1/4 a pill_ this is an efficient way of reducing some side effects_ but still get results..  In other words: feel free to experiment (1/4 a pill has worked fine for myself and 2 other guys I know_ one who was losing quite a bit of hair).,M,25,3  months,4/30/2006,Propecia
366, 1, thinning all over head,took for about 3 weeks and woke up one day with red bumps and whiteheads. my neck was beat red and stayed that way for days. it was embarrassing.,this drug is more powerful than you think so be carefull.,M,26,3  days,4/21/2006,Propecia
367, 5, Thinning hair,Very mild form of testical pain_but I find only if bump them where in the past it would hurt for a min then go away... Now I find it starts slightly hurting again the next morning__ but only mild and for a short while..  The other thing I noticed was a drop in ejaculant volume__ (I've had all my kids__so Big Deal !!) ..  Pleasure or sensation of sex has not changed..  I think thats all in your head.. If anything__ I think its better now then 7 years ago..  The mind is a powerfull organ !,Worked for me... filled in my crown area that was just starting to get the MUNK look..  Also made the rest of the top feel and look a little more fuller..  Didn't really do anything for the temples though __ but that's fine.. Overall I'm very pleased.. And will continue use until something better comes along..,M,48,7  years,4/19/2006Email,Propecia
368, 3, receding / thinning hair,first few months testicular pain_ brain fog_ huge adrenalin rush for no reason (ie: panic attack if you panic),After increased shedding initially hair seems to be thickening at crown.No improvement at temples. Have had headaches all day for last 5 weeks_ as well as blurred vision and ringing in ears. Last week had swollen left teste. Ultra sound and blood tests normal - doc said stop riding bike for few days. Nuts ok now but headache_ vision  and ears ringing still. Doc's got me seeing neurologist in 8 weeks. I'm going thru diet in meantime - stopped nutrasweet lite coffee: no change. Tonight i'll stop propecia for a week. I'll get back if this works.,M,35,5  months,4/19/2006,Propecia
369, 3, Receding Hairline at 21_ Familial,The only negative side effect I experienced between months 2-5 were painful bulges from ingrown hairs in my underarm which I had never experienced before during the summer.  It would be one_ last about a week_ and go away.  This occurred 4 separate times.  It may not have even been caused by Propecia.As for hair loss prevention_ I am mildly satisfied.  I also use Rogaine in combination_ but the front scale has continued to thin and lose hair (albeit_ I believe_ at a slower rate than before I started the medicine).My grandfather on my mother's side was completely bald in his late 20s_ and my father has a deep widow's peak.  The grandfather's loss was exasperated by psoriasis on the scalp_ and though my general physician said my scalp looked fine_ I have not had a dermatologist conduct testing -- and the Rogaine causes mild itching.,,M,23,10  months,4/19/2006,Propecia
370, 5, Recession of hairline,Ok.. Its been a month and I have noticed alot of shedding. I heard this was good but I thought it took a couple months before the shedding would take place. I HAVE AN INCREASE IN SEX DRIVE_ HARDER ERECTIONS_ AND FEEL STRONGER IN THE GYM... I am wondering if it is possible if I am one of the few with a bad reaction to the medicine called reflex androgenecity? I am hoping the shedding stops.,,M,24,1  days,4/17/2006Email,Propecia
371, 5, thinning and hair loss,No side effects. I still horny as always and I never had difficulty achiving an erection. I can ejaculate and go right back to business in a couple of minutes.,I had some testicular disconfort after a few months of usage_ but it went away in a couple of weeks. Everyone noticed that I have grown alot of hair_ specially people who had not seen me for a year. (By the way_ I am also using Monoxil 5%).,M,34,1.2  years,4/14/2006,Propecia
372, 3, hair loss,Mostly less desire to have sex_ other than that_ im fine,I've been taking perpecia for 27 days now i think its helping out but its not worth the money_ Im gonna stop taking it and see what happens. Hopefully nothing 2 drastic,M,19,27  days,4/5/2006,Propecia
373, 2, Receding Hairline and thinning,Softer erections_ Decrease in the amount of semen_ Seems as if the penis doesnt wanna grow to its full size_ Headache_ Shortness of  breath_ dizziness_ Laziness_ tiredness_ lack of ability to concentrate etc,It stopped my hair from falling but caused a lot of other side effects and i wonder if its worth it?,M,24,8  months,4/5/2006Email,Propecia
374, 1, Thinning Hair,After only a few days of taking the medicine I noticed an acne-type rash on the back of my neck around the hairline.  I stayed on the medicine for several months but tried different acne treatments to clear up the rash.  I stopped taking Propecia but the rash persisted for more than a month.  Finally_ the rash cleared up and I wanted to see if the Propecia was the cause.  So I took ONLY two pills and over two weeks after taking the pills I'm still fighting an uphill battle with the rash.  I'd rather be bald_ at least people don't look at you funny if you're loosing your hair!!,It's definetly not worth the side effects!,M,30,3  months,4/5/2006,Propecia
375, 3, hair loss,increased blood pressure_ some anxiety and inablity to make decisions_ as well as decreased libido,it did help with my hair but the sex drive loss sucks.,M,24,4  years,3/26/2006,Propecia
376, 3, hereditary baldness,watery semen during first 6 months.  Semen is fine now.  Libido is fine.  Initially had a bit of gyno_ but not as bad after 1 year.  Have experienced intermittant anxiety and depression for the first time in my 36 years of life.  Wierd.  I stopped taking it for one month at one point and the anxiety and depression was non-existent.  Pretty sure they're Propecia related since I'm experiencing those again.,Did a good job at the crown.  Original bald crown was 95 square centimeters.  Now bald area is around 58 square centimeters_ so yea it turned the vellous hairs into terminal hairs.  Mainly got vellous hairs (if anything) on top and front.  (I'm a Norwood 6 and just trying to stabilize my hairloss until I can get in for the FUE and BHT transplants).  After transplants I will definitely STOP using this drug.,M,37,15  months,3/19/2006,Propecia
377, 1, Hair loss,"Well_ I wrote on this forum about 5 months ago(one of the ""27 M""'s listed below) that I had stopped taking propecia due to fatigue_ tiredness_ difficulty concentrating_ remembering things and so on. I can now say without a doubt that since stopping the propecia I have made a full mental recovery. It definitely was the propecia. It really_ really screwed up almost a year of my life. Not cool_ not cool at all.",,M,27,3.5  years,3/13/2006,Propecia
378, 2, thinning,negative thoughts_ shortness of breath_ HEAVY dreaming (I wake up exhausted) after one month. i wasn't looking for any of these as side effects_ but all of them led me to search the web for other people's experiences. very glad i found this page. i could completely see that if these symptoms kept up_ i could very easily start having panic attacks. i won't take another pill. the thinning isn't worth and i'm 40_ so what the hell_ it's time to go bald.,it may work_ but the side effects_ going on for a couple of weeks now_ don't work for me.,M,40,30  days,2/22/2006,Propecia
379, 4, Thinning Hair,No doubt about it_ this drug cuts down on my sex drive. At first_ I thought I must be getting old_ but then I began to research side effects and realized that Propeica is known to cause decreased libido. What a hobson's choice: Get to date the hotter women because you're not bald_ but don't get to have much sex. Or...have plenty of sex with a lesser woman; that is a chick that has to settle for dating a bald or balding man.,Love the hair. Hate the lack of sex drive.,M,31,4  months,2/16/2006,Propecia
380, 4, Hair Loss,Breast Enlargement_ panic attacks for which I now take propranolol.,I've been on propecia for a long time and never even thought about side effects coming from the pill.  My breasts are larger_ which I hate and I started having uncontrollable situational anxiety a few years ago.  After reading some of these statements_ I am contemplating getting off but don't want to lose the hair.  However_ if it would make the breasts and anxiety go away_ I would do it.,M,24,6  years,2/15/2006,Propecia
381, 1, balding,My testicals started hurting a couple times a day.  It was like someone was squeezing them.  Also_ there seems to be a slight squeeze on them all the time.  I talked to a friend who has been on it for over a year and he said he has the same thing.  He said that it once felt like they were in a vice.  I've only been on this drug for maybe 10 days so I hope that I don't have any permanent side effects.  I doubt that I will_ but after reading all of these testimonials.  I'm definitely quiting.  Maybe I'll go with the HT.  That seems safer.,,M,30,10  days,2/13/2006,Propecia

Seeing red when I wake in the the night! and will be fine after sleeping again _ 3.Can not read small prints unless I am close to a light source and hold it away than normal_ 4. back pain_ 5. watery withdrawl_ 6. extreme tiredness_ feeling lazy_ no energy  and needing to sleep alot.,I have been taking Propecia for 3 years_ The hair loss has decreased considerebaly but definetly no hair growth. dont recommend if side effects proved to be Propecia related as it's better to bald gracefully.,M,44,3  years,2/11/2006,Propecia
385, 1, Hair Thinning,Lower libido_erection not as hard as before & dramatic decrease in sex drive within 2 weeks of use.,I started using propecia recently on the recommendation of my doctor.I read the side effects were rare (less than 2%)_so started the medicine with a lot of optimism_hoping it will benefit me without getting side effects.Unfortunately_in less than 2 weeks_i experienced sexual side effects like lower libido_erection not as hard as before & dramatic decrease in sex drive.Im 25 & sex drive is not something im willing to compromise on_so i've stopped taking the drug & dont recommend it as i feel the chances of getting somekind of sexual side effect from this drug is inevitable_unlike what is documented.ROGAINE HERE I COME!,M,25,13  days,2/11/2006Email,Propecia
386, 3, Hair thinning and receding,none that i can really say definatley came for the drug,More than anything it just basically just slowed or maybe stopped the loss_ didn't really grow much back. Its much cheaper to buy  proscar and a pill cutter and chop each pill into four pieces.,M,33,6  days,2/9/2006,Propecia
387, 4, hair loss temples and crown,I had increased sex drive_ harder erections and could have multiple orgasims.  I am 40 and just had 3 in an hour_ was not happening before propecia and pretty good for 40_ I think.  Not sure if propecia is causing this_ but it's been increased libido for me.  So_ that's good.  Ejaculate is watery though_ definately since the drug_ though this doesn't decrease satisfaction.,A bit concerned about some of the potential liver stuff that I read.  Want to look into that.  I like to have a beer now and again and don't want to take a drug and have a drink with thee potential of damaging my liver.,M,40,3  months,2/6/2006,Propecia
388, 3, hair loss,experience a lack of sexual desire at times_ especially early on using the product. Still feel an occasional dull ache in the testicles_ and at times _ a disconnect with my penis_ no change in size though. Still though erections don't feel as strong or as lasting as my pre-finsteride  days ..maybe age_ diet or maybe the drug?  I'm going to lay off the drug for a few weeks and see. I've supplemented with L-Arginine to try and help bring back  that missing libido feeling,actually taking Proscar and cut it in 1/5ths to save the money_ been on a minoxidil like product for over 10 years which has stopped the loss but wanted to give finasteride a try . Been on finasteride for 10 months now. Overall_ observed increased fullness/ small regrowth  but nothing dramatic .. I would say it has improved my hair and appearness though,M,33,10  months,2/4/2006,Propecia

390, 5, Rapid Thinning/Receeding,Nothing.,The negative experiences people have written about on this site astound me.  Propecia is a mild drug_ and the few who have experienced harsh side effects are definately the minority.  I have had great success with  propecia and now enjoy a thicker head of hair than ive had in the last two years.  More than anything_ it has greatly soothed my anxiety about losing my hair_ and allowed me to focus on the important things in my life.  I have yet to experience any side-effects_ and I reccommend this  medication to all that can afford it.,M,21,8  months,1/30/2006,Propecia
391, 5, Starting to go bald,I've had no noticable side effects,My hair started to receded quickly at age 28.  My grand father was bald by 30_ so I decided to do something.  I stared with rogaine_ but hated the flaking.  I switch to Propecia 5 years ago.  I've maintained my hair line from age 28.  The recession at the forehead did not return BUT did not recede further_ nor did my crown ever recede.  Also_ my hair is much thinker than at 28.  Now at 39 with a full head of hair_ I get compliments from hair stylists on the thickness_ and many times they have to thin it out to style it nicely!,M,39,5  years,1/27/2006,Propecia
392, 1, hair loss,I took Propecia 3 weeks.  I stopped 3 days ago due to depression_ low sex drive_ low energy_ blood in semin_ inability to concentrate_ & weakness during workout.  In fact_ during work out_ I injured my knee with easy exercises that normally wouldn't bother me at all.  The joint swelling and pain got worse daily for 6 days even though I stopped training on it.  I couldn't think clear enough to do normal tasks_ would wake up in the morning and just want to lay around. While reading_ I'd re-read the same sentence several times and still not get it. I stopped propecia 3 days ago and my knee started getting better quickly.  The confusion and depression are going away too.  Energy is returning.  Looking for my sex drive still.,I believe Propecia weakens us physically_ affecting our workouts_ sexual performance_ and ability to heal.  And if weaker_ we would be more prone to injury.  Anything that unnaturally jacks with our hormones jacks up our overall health_ can't be good.  From looking at these forums_ the 98% no side effects is a big lie.  It annoys me that the FDA would approve something so destructive to our bodies_ yet ban natural products like stevia that are good for us with no side effects.  It's all a big scam; FDA in bed with the drug makers.,M,40,21  days,1/23/2006,Propecia
393, 5, thinning,i had testicular pain for one day and then went away. I seem to lose some weight and have more energy a plus in my book!!!!,this drug so far works very well already almost a month seeing good regrowth.

394, 1, Thinning Hair,Slightly decreased sex drive_ Semen became thinner and more watery. After four years I started to notice more soft tissue around my breast area and after researching forums like these I have stopped taking it. Also lost about 7% of my body weight.,Hair thinning did slow down_ no regrowth. This drug did help keep hair on my head but in my opinion is not worth the risk. Just because it is recocnised by the FDA it does not mean it can't do ireversable damage to your body. BEWARE!!!Please add a comment about this drug for all our benefits!,M,27,4  years,1/18/2006,Propecia
395, 1, Hair loss,Man boobs (male breasts) and libido reduction. no side effects until 3rd year or so,I used this piece of shit for 4 years. What pisses me off is that the clinical trials say that male breasts are not a side effect_ so it is completely undocumented.  if I knew that there was a risk of a PERMANENT side effect_ I never would have used it. I experienced the sexual side effect as well_ but that went away in 3 weeks after i stopped taking it. As far as preventing hair loss_ it worked like a charm. But now I've stopped taking it for almost a year_ aot of hair has fallen out (Although it turns out_ its still ooks fine overall)_ but I got little man boobs THAT WONT GO AWAY. I'm embarrassed to take my shirt off in public. Anyone up for suing Merck?,M,30,4  years,1/17/2006,Propecia
396, 4, increasing hair loss,The only two major side effects I've experienced were muscle loss and decreased libido_ of which both were reduced drastically.  Being a very active athlete_ I lost a great deal of solid muscle--my body weight went from 190 to 164 in six months or so--and my libido was cut down to 25 percent.  However_ the hair eventually stopped shedding and I am still healthy though skinnier.  I am going to try getting off it for a while and see what happens.  Also_ after the first six months I began yelling at everyone at work like there was no tomorrow and don't know if the drug induced these tantrums.  Fortunately_ nothing bad came of my side effects permanently speaking_ I hope_ and let's see what happens.,,M,30,8  days,1/6/2006,Propecia
397, 1, Hair loss,Reduced hair loss but NOT worth it! Felt like my prostate and gonads were drying up. Decreased libido (not a bad thing_ but felt unnatural like I was neutered)_ reduced ejaculate volume_ decreased performance in the gym_ lower back pain_ all so soon. Works exactly opposite of DHEA supplements.,It reduces the 5-alpha reductase enzyme_ works opposite of DHEA supplements. This can't be good for normal people as the comments on this forum show. I could reduce dosage to once every 2 or 3 days but I will STOP taking it. I noticed DHEA supplements had opposite effects: increased hair loss_ increased libido and ejaculate volume_ increased ability to lift in the gym and reduced joint pain_ but made me aggressive. I will take some DHEA to get back to normal_ then just let my body do its own thing. THOSE OF YOU WITH PERMANENT SIDE EFFECTS_ take DHEA to see if you can reverse it!,M,44,12  days,1/4/2006,Propecia
398, 4, hair loss,"I started taking propecia back in March of 2002 and saw results almost immediately.  It really stopped my hair loss in it's tracks and started helping me to re-grow and maintain my hair.  I noticed less body hair too_ which was a nice little side-effect..  However_ it did also effect my sex drive_ making it harder for me to get an erection and decreased the size of my erection when I did get one.  It also severely cut down on the amount of semen (ejaculate produced).  I also noticed wierd ""jelly"" like pieces in my semen_ which also made it hard at times to ejaculate also.  I lost most if not all my desire to have sex.  Got very depressed and lazy and after a year and a half of taking propecia_ I started having sever lower back pain as well when I slept (Dec. 2003).  I toughed it out for almost 9 months_ but finally went to a doctor when I found it was getting worse.  After a series of tests_ I was told I had an enlarged lymph node in my stomach (close to my pancreas).  They o",In any case_ I heard rumors that propecia could be the culprit_ so back in Feb. of 2005 (with still no decrease in the size of the lymph node) I stopped taking the drug.  I started losing all the gained hair on my head a few months later_ but noticed the back pain start to go away too.  My sex drive came back almost immediately_ but my ejaculant got thicker and harder to come out.  Now after having my latest CT scans a few days ago_ I was informed that the enlarged lymph node is starting to get smaller.  Coincidence?  I don't know..  Has anyone else experience enlarged lymph nodes as a result of taking this drug?  My enlarged lymph node was 4.6 x 4.6 cm and is now 4.1 x 4.1 cm.  Hopefully if it was propecia that did this_ by stopping my use of the drug I'll get back to normal.  If propecia is the culprit_ then my vanity led me to now have have an ugly scar on my abdomen and a potentially deadly disease!  Nice huh?  Don't take propecia!

402, 1, Hair loss,It was totally amazing in how much it really worked to regrow my hair.  I am 20 years old and I was experiencing agressive male pattern hair loss at a very young age.  I was very devastating and my doctor recommended propecia.  I took the drug for nine months and it entirely stopped all hair loss.  Everyday I swear I could see a few new hair popppin up.  This is a very powerful and effective drug.  If you want to stop hairloss and regrow hair than this is a miracle.  But if you dont want to have stomach aches_ anxiety_ depression_ problems with sex_ testicular swelling_ pain while urinating_ or any of the other damadge this horrible drug does to our bodies stay away from it!!!!,It definately caused acne(rash on top of my head) after stopping the use of this drug.  I got three panic attack before I realized and concluded that the way I was feeling wasn't because of the food I ate last night_ or the pill I take for acne_ but only PROPECIA.  This shit really made me sick to my stomach everyday for weeks untill I finally realized that it was from the drug.  I always took at it night so every morning I felt like shit.  One day_ (the day I realized my sickness was form Propecia) was a day I  DONT TAKE THIS POISON!!!!I recommend everybody out there somehow or another deal with the depression of going bald any day over trying to render the realities of life with this drug.,M,20,9  days,12/1/2005Email,Propecia

405, 1, Hair loss/thinning,I took Propecia for a year and a half without any noticeable side effects except maybe the fact that I didn't have anymore erections when I woke up in the morning. Then I started going out with a girl and everytime after I had an erection_ I would have transparent secretions and intense testicular/groin/pelvic area pain like I had a baseball bat swing in the crouch. This would last for hours. Also_ after reading this board I realise I got anxiety and panic attacks for no reasons as well as the other guys. I've been seeing a urologist and been diagnosed with prostatitis. Took antibiotics for 6 months. When I was taking propecia with the antibio the problem would not disapear_ but as soon as I stopped propecia the pain would decrease although the secretions stayed. After stopping the antibiotics and propecia_ the pain is still there and I'm totally lost on what causes it. I past all the tests too and i'm normal. The urologist diagnosed me with recurrent pelvian pain now. I think after re,I stopped loosing hair and regrew hair on the temples and my hair got thicker. Now I've been on and off for about 7 months and I lost most of what I regrew in the first year. Really efficient product but it scares me too much. If I'd started loosing hair at 40 years old I would accept it. I think 23 is a little too young to accept though. I think I will wait for further reasearch or new imporved products.,M,23,1.5  years,11/29/2005,Propecia
406, 1, hair loss,I took this drug from 1998 to 2000 (just over 2 years).  I immediately started experiencing agressive shedding after 2 months which lasted up until the 6 month along with mild acne.  It was in the summer of 1999 that I noticed something unusual.  I developed a very small bald patch near my temple (the size of a grain of rice).  I did pay alot of attention to it.  The overall hairloss was continuing a slow pace.  By early 2000 I noticed that the hairloss was still continuing but now my facial hair has started to thin along with the hair on my legs and under my arms.  After 2 years (the summer of 2000) I noticed a few more small bald spots in my scalp and my facial hair was very thin.  I immediately stopped using Propecia and sought help.  My hairloss was normal hairloss before propecia but after being off of it for five years I am in a constant battle with small bald spots all over my scalp_ the crown of my scalp is very tender and my facial hair is patchy and has stopped growing in par,I might have had some very mild regrowth in my temple area but not worth mentioning since the side effects were horrendous.

Early after taking propecia_ my blood pressure went up_ so started medication for that.  I didn't know what was wrong_ but I knew something wasn't right.  Because I don't like to take medication_ I stopped propecia about 1.5 weeks ago.  I feel great.

It has not harmed my sperm count.  I have 3 kids.  If anyone has any idea what that might be I would be curious to hear.",My hair was starting to bald on my crown when I was 26.

410, 3, Hair Loss,Hair stopped falling out. No problems with erection or ejaculation. Have been on medication for 2-3 years. For past six months have experienced: unexplained tiredness; difficulty thinking and remembering things; lowered sex drive; loss of energy. Have been trying to isolate reason as I am a happy person - definetely not depressed - also not under abnormal stress or anything. I've had a huge medical workup including tests for every disease and condition known to man. They found nothing wrong with me. Recently_ I was told it could be propecia - but dismissed that idea. Then over the past week I didn't take propecia -just sort of forgot- but I started feeling better. Two days ago I took one (just 1 mg supply as I am young)before I went to sleep and_ bingo_ started feeling bad again in the night/morning. Stopped taking propecia intentionally yesterday. Feel normal again this morning. We'll see if I keep feeling better. Have been in agony for past 6 months worried about what this strange ti,I've given it a 3 because it didn't make my hair grow thicker - just  slowed hair loss but will give it a 1 if it turns out to be the reason for horrible symptoms I have been experiencing for past 6 months.,M,27,3  years,10/31/2005,Propecia

412, 4, Hair Loss.,After a month and a half_ I noticed that my skin had become incredibly oily and I developed spots. However_ by using a simple skin care product for oily skin I was able to get that under control. Also_ in the past few weeks I've noticed a decreased sex drive_ although it is--or seems to be--stabilizing again.,I've been taking Propecia for just under three months now. After two months_ I noticed that my hair loss had decreased significantly. Unfortunately_ I've been shedding quite a bit of hair again for the past four weeks_ though I've read that this is a good sign_ since when a hair follicle is stimulated into the growth cycle the first thing it does is shed the old hair. (This phase apparently lasts around 4-6 weeks_ so here's hoping.) Anyway_ I have seen some fuzzy regrowth at the temples_ where my thinning was a little noticeable. Propecia is supposed to work better for younger men who haven't been going bald for a long period of time_ so I'm hoping for a lot more regrowth.,M,19,3  months,10/20/2005,Propecia

Check with doctor showed heart bundle branch block and basically I'm now with a pacemaker. Had no prior problems or risk factors (non drinker/smoker_ no family history). Doctor advised something caused heart muscle to weaken and thus it wasn't pumping fast enough to supply blood oxygen to the brain thus causing the syncope.

454, 2, Male pattern baldness,Nil,Expensive Program that increased my hair growth for several months. After several months of good results my hair slowly thinned out again and I started to lose it again. I did not stop the program at any stage and I was one of the first persons who started taking this drug when it was released several years ago. I have now stopped taking the drug as it no longer works for me.,M,31,3  years,7/30/2003,Propecia
455, 4, Hairloss,None,Seems to be working.  If I go off for a month or so I see a slight change in my hair (I think).  Either way_ not losing hair since starting it over 3 years ago and it was going fast back then.,M,33,4  years,2/25/2003,Propecia
456, 2, hair loss,after the first few months_ I had slight eye and face twitches,WITHDRAWAL Two days after I quit taking propecia I had my first panic attack. I can no longer drink caffeine (when before I could chug a thermos full of coffee in a few hours) without triggering agitation_ shaking_ rigorous eye and face twitching. Trouble concentrating_ mood swings. Taking Klonopin and going through CBT therapy helped get me back to normal.Be careful!,M,24,5  months,8/30/2002Email,Propecia
457, 3, Hair Loss,None.,Slowed hair loss for first year. Seems to have stopped hair loss in second year of using the drug. No regrowth_ but I am happy to stop losing hair. I wish I had started on propecia earlier in life_ as I think I could have saved more hair.,M,29,2  years,8/24/2001,Propecia
458, 3, Hair Loss,Experienced no obvious side effects_ But I am wondering what the long terms effects of this drug are. Does anyone know?,Well the drug did work. It's pretty expensive though_ and most drug plans do not cover it. You can't donate blood if you are taking it either. It causes birth defects_ thats somewhat scary.  The choice would really be up to the user,M,22,6  months,8/21/2001Email,Propecia
