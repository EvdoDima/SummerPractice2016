1, 2, Allergic Rhinitis & ETD,Drowsiness - got worse after 3rd day - could hardly stay awake at work!Dizzy!   started 3rd day and got worse each day after.   Anxiety....feeling jittery at times....legs felt weak.  Sneezing!Mild nausea feeling started after 7 or 8 days,also noticed small amounts of dried blood in nostril each morning although no nose bleeds.  Noticed muscle aches_ especially in joints and neck_ after a week. Definitely seemed to help ease the sinus pressure_ but after doesn't seem to be doing anything at all for the Eustachian tube dysfunction.,M,54,9  days2 puffs 1X D,10/28/2015,Astelin
2, 2, Allergic Rhinitis,I was prescribed Astelin after had a major allergy attack. It really did help it worked about seven days after I started it I developed chest pain. I do have a history of coronary spasms. I took my nitro four times the day it first happened. I looked up side effects and became wary. I  Took it again several days later when I was going to be exposed to something I'm really allergic to. Five hours later I was driving and had crushing chest pain. I will never take it again be wary of it if you have any type of cardiac history. I have not had any chest pain since I stopped it. By the way I hadn't had any chest pain for over year when that happened my cardiologist does believe it is connected,My dose was two sprays each nostril,F,40,2  weeks205.5mcg,9/17/2015,Astelin

5, 1, Allergies & sinus,I'd used this previously but stopped because of taste and bp issues. Restarted because of severe allergies. Wish I had never done it! Was so exhausted and the worst was that it sent my BP way up_ 160/89. I also had an increase in heart rate that was a scary thing - 100+ beats per minute. NEVER again! It's been a miserable day and I won't repeat it!  Be very careful when you decide to use this medicine. Read the list of side effects in detail. Reviews and post marketing are the only ones that mention this as an issue. ,,F,58,1  days,7/1/2015,Astelin
6, 2, allergies,Tried this medication once in the evening. It stopped my skin from feeling itchy but it caused some pretty severe depression and then I conked out.  :P  I can't deal with depression or passing out like that and the allergies came back full force the following morning.,,F,38,1  days1 squirt 2X D,5/7/2015Email,Astelin
7, 4, non allergic vasular rhinitis,Works better than anything I have used but I am exhausted.  I have never had an issue with sleepiness from drugs_ even benedryl does not give me problems_ but this drug makes me feel like I should sleep 20 hours a day,I have had vascular non allergic rhinitis since I was young and it has gotten worse with age_ making me feel like I have a continual cold/sinus infection.   I am allergic to weather/barometer changes which causes migraines/ strong smells and I believe I also have allergic rhinitis and hayfever.  Most of the time I feel like I have a horrible cold.  This has really helped but I can't handle the sleepiness or the lack of ambition.  I take it only at night now and use flonase during the day_ but I still am tired.  If I quit taking it_ the exhaustion disappears_ but the symtoms of the rhinitis become horrible.,F,66,4  weeks30 mg 2X D,10/17/2014Email,Astelin

9, 1, vasomotor rhinitis,Terrible aching pains - deep_ unremitting muscles aches in the calves of both legs within 2 days of starting this medicine_ spreading to the backs of the knees_ the thigh muscles and the hips within the first week. It took 2 weeks for the pains to dissipate after stopping it.,It was insidious - my legs started aching immediately - a deep dull ache in the muscles - mainly the calves at first. I had driven 400 miles and thought it dehydration or just sitting for too long. And then it got worse and worse until on day 7 it was literally agony_ I thought I had a DVT but it was both legs - the calves_ behind the knees (deep in them)_ up through the thighs and into the hips. Deep_ unremitting_ terrible pain. I could hardly sleep at night.It wasn't until day 7 that the penny dropped and I realized that it might be this medicine. I came to this site and saw other people had been similarly affected. I stopped it and prayed that the symptoms would dissipate. It it took a full 2 weeks for the aching to go away. A little every day - 5-10% - until finally it was gone.The effects of the spray as a decongestant weren't so remarkable - it didn't work very well in that regard.,F,63,7  days2 squirts 2X D,9/30/2014,Astelin

Side effects were much worse than what the medicine was supposed to cure.,Worked decently for my nasal drip and I was pretty happy 1-2 days in. Then I started getting muscle twitches and soon the other side effects followed. Didn't realize that it was the Astelin causing it until later after which I ceased the medicine. The blood pressure subsided and anxiety was reduced (but not back to normal). Twitches subside but still exist.,M,,3  months 1X D,10/12/2013,Astelin

14, 1, post nasal drip,Three months into taking Astelin I experienced anxiety_ paranoia_ and high blood pressure.  I went off for two weeks and things cleared up; I had such bad allergies I took it again for five days and the symptoms came back.  I also lost a lot of my sense of smell and taste while taking Astelin.,The FDA drug study on Astelin is a joke.  250 people took it for 30 days???  That is a study in stupidity.,M,33,3.5  months2 sprays 1X D,2/26/2013Email,Astelin

I didn't mind the bitter taste - it is a medication after all - but it felt as if my symptoms were getting worse_ including incessant coughing at night. I didn't even put the severe heart palpitations and the super-weird dreams together with the Azelastine use before I read the comments other people left here... I am not a morning person to begin with but now it is almost impossible to get out of bed in the morning.

21, 4, Allergies,I sometimes had a burning in my throat and almost always a burning in my nose (probably due to the citric acid in it).  However_ it really stopped the sneezing and really helped out with allergy-related fatigue.,This product does not contain sucralose_ as Astepro does_ so I feel more comfortable taking it.  Astepro is sweeter than Astelin_ but it's due to the sucralose in it.

But my major problem is post-nasal drip and that has not significantly improved.Cons: Hunger is so bad I can't think about anything other than food.

23, 1, allergies,I took Astelin for 3 days but had to stop due to unexplained muscle jerks and twitching.  Stopping the medicine did not stop the side effects_ they became much worse.  They are now so severe I have to take 2 different meds to control them and have to visit my neurologist every 6 months.  I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this side effect.,I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone!!!  3 neurologists and alot of money later_ I have them about 90% under control.  This is a life long effect which I am hoping does not get worse over time.,F,47,3  days 1X D,7/22/2011Email,Astelin
24, 4, post-nasal drip,No bad taste experienced_ but it made me drowsy_ and feeling as if I had a general anesthetic a couple of hours earlier.  This drug evidently crosses the blood-brain barrier.  I thought that only first generation antihistamines were supposed to do that.  Too risky.  Comments here pretty scary.  I'll use in future only if desperate.,Very effective elimination of post-nasal drip_ which had been with me for several months.  The PND had been affecting my breathing by dripping into the bronchial passages.  However_ I still feel a little short of breath. I don't know if that's due to the drug or because there's some pre-existing bronchial constriction in sync with the nasal congestion. At least I've established that my PND is curable.,M,54,3  days 2X D,11/6/2010,Astelin

31, 3, Chronic sinusitis,I initially tolerated Astelin quite well. It made me tired at work but nothing a cup of tea wouldn't fix. After a year an half_ I suddenly began experiencing a sensation as if I didn't have enough oxygen in my system. After discontinuing all medications_ I began to re-introduce them one at a time. After the first dose of Astelin_ I began experiencing the same sensation. I discontinued use of Astelin and was fine. Unfortunately_ nothing worked quite as well as Astelin with my sinusitis. They introduced a new version of it so my doctor gave me a sample_ thinking it may have been some particular ingredient in the original that may have been changed in the new version. He was wrong. After the first dose_ I began experiencing the same lack of oxygen sensations. I have not used it since.,It was great while it lasted but it seems I developed a hyper-sensitivity to it after having used it successfully for a long period of time.,M,53,2  years1 spray ea 1X D,9/29/2010,Astelin

Astelin has worked wonderfully well at preventing any allergic attacks so far this season and I have had NO trouble breathing.  It took approximately 1 month of use before any side effects occurred_ and since I currently take NO other medications and am in generally good health_ I can only attribute my recent problems with Astelin.  I am an RN and have been researching my symptoms day in and day out_ only to end up on numerous medications for a ""migraine"" that has lasted over 10 days.  I decided to stop taking ALL medications last night and am just finally free of pain in my head.  I will not be taking Astelin anymore.  I am sure this medicine is wonderful for some_ but the side effects just are not worth the freedom from allergies for me.

I have a very bad nose(deviated septum) and have always had problems from allergies(grass_ceder_pets).  Not until i tried to wing myself off of astelin is when i noticed i am having heart palpitations.  I have been a college athlete and know my body very well...Do have some history of overweight grandpa with irregular heartbeat.  I am 26 and i am in tremendous shape.  Prolonged use of Astelin has turned out to be a very scary thing for me.,I have been tired at work_ but do not think astelin is the culprit_ many people(me) have sleep apnea that also suffer from extreme allergies and deviated septum.the Heart Palpitations is consistent in my experience.  Not until my third 30 ML bottle_ did i start to experience the irregular heart beat.  I run and weight train close to 5 days a week and have been a collegiate athlete as little as three years ago.

35, 1, non-allerginic rhinitis,I'm the one who described having Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms after taking Astelin for 6 weeks.  The symptoms are still on-going_ though lessened a bit.  Turns out my body is only mimicking RA.  It is also mimicking another auto-immune_ inflammation response: Lichen Planus.  With this disease I get white webbing through the tissue under my tongue.  This is the only fatal form of the disease and I have had a small chunk of my tongue cut out for biopsy.  My mother also took Astelin for a couple of months.  Her body is also mimicking RA.  Looks like we'll both have the extreme pain and fatigue of RA for life.  Plus_ with the Lichen Planus I'll have to be screened for cancer once a year.  The thing I don't get is if my lab work shows that my body is only mimicking these two auto-immune_ inflammation responses_ why won't the symptoms go away now that I'm no longer taking the Astelin.,Has ruined both mine and my mother's lives.,M,52,6  weeksmaximum 2X D,6/28/2010Email,Astelin

45, 5, Post nasal drip after nasal infect.,None.,I had a bad sino-bronchial infection. Even after I was cured of that_ I had very bad post nasal drip. Astelin was amazingly effective in clearing up the post nasal drip. I used 2 sprays per nostril twice a day until I was out of the 200-spray bottle. I held my head down for a few minutes after the sprays_ to assure I did not taste the bitter taste. This is a wonderful drug in my opinion.  It cost me $50 co-pay since it is a brand drug_ but it was worth every penny. Note: I don't have any allergies_ so this use of the drug was for inflammation left over from a nasal infection.

It is too expensive_ dangerous and the only time that I wasn't severly affected by the drowsiness was when I only squirted the orange liquid in one nostril and leaned forward while I gently breathed in through that clogged nostril. I used this product a grand total of 3 times. I was perscribed this by a new doctor and she told me to just ""try it out"" and she also perscribed me Atarax which also causes drowsiness_ the combination of the two often causes upper respirator issues and I have enough of those already. I couldn't even notice if it actually worked because it seemed that all I could do was sit on my bed at home and twitch. The only time I will ever use it again is if I get so sick that I can't breathe through either one of my nostrils.",F,16,2  days,10/10/2009,Astelin

57, 4, Chronic nasal allergies,I take it only when my condition gets very bad. I take one spray in each nostril. Makes me very drowsy and so I take it at night only. While the sleep is always good_ it also produces vivid dreaming. Fortunately they are good dreams. Last night's were beautiful_ including wonderful landscapes _ exquisite architecture_ subdued colors_ festive people_ etc.etc. Only bad was a friend in trouble. But everything is sooo  realistic_ it was amazing. That is why I googled Astelin side-effects this morning and here I am!,If it works take it only when absolutely necessary. The other unpleasant side-effects like bitter taste_ temporarily sore sinus and nasal-passages  are outweighed by the relief_ unlike say Benadryl which leaves me almost disabled with drowsiness and long period of lethargic malaise.,M,63,2  years,9/30/2009,Astelin

Dissappointed.,As this is a last resort-- I've tried eveything else-- I gave Astelin 2 full weeks of full dosage and still no improvement. But quality of life otherwise took a nose-dive (no pun intended!).,F,27,2  weeks,8/22/2009,Astelin
60, 2, chronic sinus problems/no allergies,Extreme drowsiness especially during first week.  Heart palpitions_ weird dreams_ continually waking up during night. Very difficult to get out of bed in the morning and lethargic during the day. Did not help with sinus headaches in morning and all day.  Extra weight gain (in addition to menopause)!  No bitter taste at all because I did not breathe in heavily while spraying (as per directions).  Unable to fully function at work or home and loss of interest in regular activities.  Overall_ not a good experience.,While it does seem to clear the sinuses the side-effects don't warrant continued use.  As this was an interim option until results of Sinus CT I don't suspect my doctor will prescribe in the future for me.,F,52,2  weeks,8/15/2009,Astelin

People have major side effects to prescription drugs AFTER the FDA has approved it and it's on the market.  When a study has only used 250 people to test the drug before it hits market (such as Astelin)_ I don't think that is representing the whole population.  When I read how many other people have similar side effects to mine on this website_ I am wondering why prescription drug companies are overlooking this issue. We as consumers need to speak up and report these things to the FDA and the company who manufactures the drug.,F,30,5  days,8/11/2009,Astelin

Thought the problem was with my thyroid or menopause but those checked out fine. Did not suspect Astelin until cardiologists asked which meds I took (Astelin is the only one) and I checked for side effects on the web.

71, 3, Post Nasal Drip due to Allergy,Well I only took this once yesterday morning.  It worked_ however my vision was off all day.  I don't need glasses for close up however could not see close up well all day.  I will try it again_ maybe at night is what I was thinking until I saw all of the comments on here. Anyway_ thought I would add this_ because I did not see it on here.  I was taking no other new drug when I tried this_ so it has to be connected.,I am sure it still works for a lot of people.  My Doctor uses it and swears by it.,F,49,1  days,4/27/2009,Astelin
72, 4, Seasonal Allergies,For the first two weeks of taking Astelin_ I was very dizzy and felt generally out of sorts.  I also expereinced relatively bad headaches.  However_ I was desperate to have relief from my allergies (runny nose_ itchy eyes_ ears and throat_ sneezing_ congestion) so I stuck it out.  After the initial two weeks_ the side effects faded to almost non-existance (they are much more tolarable than the effects of the allergies).,I am on the one spray_ twice a day dosage.  It has definitely worked for me.,F,27,1  years,4/23/2009,Astelin
73, 3, Yes,Severe Rapid Weight Gain,I was in love with this nose spray for about 5 months. I usually have 2-3 sinus infections every winter and had had none since taking it. In fact_ head colds seemed to stay away from me_ too although they were affecting everyone else around me. In the meantime_ I was depressed about my 15 pound weight gain in 5 months even though I had started exercising and eating better. Finally put 2 and 2 together_ especially after reading the comments here. If you are gaining mad weight in a short amount of time and are taking this drug_ I would seriously consider this as your culprit. Too bad since it seemed to be an answer to prayer for me and I'm not sure what I will do now.,F,36,5  months,4/17/2009,Astelin

My judgment was always cloudy_ my nose and head were always stuffy_ my eyes were always itchy_ I was always tired and felt terrible especially during the fall and spring when allergies were at their peak.  This is the only product that has ever worked almost instantly and kept working all day long.  I take it once a day in the morning and it works great.  I can finally breath right_ my voice is not so nasally_ I can jog without gasping for breath_ I am not so edgy and grumpy and I can just enjoy life. While I do have some minor side effects it is well worth it because the side effects of the allergies were much much greater and kept me from enjoying my life.,M,30,6  months,3/5/2009,Astelin

82, 2, Sinusitis -chronic bronchitis,At first I thought it was a miracle drug (even with permanent nasty taste).  I could breathe again_ not be constantly sick with sinusitis/bronchitis/pneumonia.  Then I began to notice blood in nasal mucus with blood clots.  It worsened to deep nasal membrane lesions/non-healing nose sores (almost a razor affect to nasal lining).  I am trying to use q tip deliver medicine to back of my throat without going touching nasal membranes.

I take lower dose than prescribed (usually only 1 squirt per nostril once a day). However I took the extra nighttime dose last night (because my symptoms have been bad for a couple of days)and had terrible insomnia. I can't think of any other reason except the Astelin.,This medication has really helped me with the rhinitis - I used to have sneezing attacks for days at a time that basically kept me from functioning.

On another note_ the chest pain and inability to breath normally have led me to dicontinue use of this drug.  I didn't experience this right away_ but then after a couple of months I began to use it on a more regular basis when seasonal allergies kicked in_ and I couldn't figure out why my chest suddenly started hurting 24/7_ heart palipations_ and difficulty breathing as well as muscle soreness.

Throughout the day I feel this weird pressure inside my head behind my nose_ cheeks_ and in the back of my head. I have to swallow really hard because it feels like stuff is draining a lot near my ears. The weirdest thing is that my jaws tense up every few minutes and my throat feels tight too. The tense feeling moves all over my head. It could be my sinuses finally breaking apart?

I was hoping for improved performance over other drugs which are taken in pill form.  Instead_ it performed worse.  I did not experience the most common side effects (a foul taste in the mouth_ nasal dryness)_ but have now stopped taking it due to other problems.  We are now at the peak of pollen season here and I'm back on zyrtec_ which gave only partial relief in the past_ but at least I did get headaches.  The weight gain really surprised me.  Up until the last month_ I have been very successfully losing weight by eating less and exercising more.  All of a sudden I've put 4 pounds back on in the last 2 weeks--although I am in better shape and able to exercise even harder.  Talk about discouraging!  One of my sports is swimming and not being able to get a full breathe is really problematic and is making a sport I have previously enjoyed_ (I am also a professional swim coach) most unenjoyable.

122, 5, Non-allergic vasomotor rhinitis,Bitter taste in back of throat IF INHALED TOO DEEPLY.  Keeps me sleeping VERY well at night.,Around three to four years ago I developed non-allergic vasomotor rhinitis more prevalent in my right nostril.  My biggest problem was extremely uncomfortable nasal congestion when laying on my right side at night_ and also in heavy humidity during hot summer days.  Steroid sprays proved too harsh (drying_ bleeding_ etc.) for what is a very basic problem (a hyperactive right nasal turbinate not effected by allergins.)  I only use two sprays in the right nostril at bedtime_ after using a saline nasal rinse.  Within a half hour or so_ my right nasal passage stays open and clear and remains that way all night long_ and through the next day.  I used to also use it in the morning_ but that seemed unecessary when I tried cutting back and noticed no decline in the quality of my breathing during the day.  Laying on my right side is no longer uncomfortable at all_ and it also seems to make my sleep deeper and fuller (some mention drowsiness as a side effect_ but honestly_ when I took it in the,F,35,3  years,5/22/2008,Astelin

I had been using Flonase for years which helped w/ most of my allergy symptoms_ but not the annoying post-nasal drip.  One thing I have noticed since taking Astelin (about 2 1/2 weeks) is that I'm a bit constipated.  I've read that constipation is a not-so-common side effect_ but I'm wondering if the Astelin is what's causing mine.

Can take deep breaths but doesn't feel like I'm getting oxygen. Started in Nov or Dec_ 4 or 5 mos after began taking Astelin. Two solid weeks I felt like I was getting no oxygen_ yet all breathing tests have been fine.  Very tired (lack of oxygen?) and definite anxiety (I curse out a lot of drivers when I'm on the road and no patience with my kids).  Accidentally forgot to take Astelin one weekend during trip and didn't have the feeling of lack of oxygen.  Wasn't able to keep up on whether it helped with breathing while running due to knee prob. Am cutting it out now for the time being to see if my tiredness_ anxiety and feeling of lack of oxygen go away completely.,After reading this site_ I don't think I'll go back to it. I assumed my weight gain was from lack of exercise after I stopped running and could only use one leg riding my bike.

This stuff blew through my life like a chemical Hurricane Katrina and I am still picking up the pieces almost 2 years after 1st taking it. It took over 6 months for the heart problems to recede_ well over a year to get my strength back from the loss of weight and muscle mass_ and I am still working through the emotional aspects of problems it caused me at work because of my inability to handle stress. This stuff pretty much wrecked the last 2 years of my life. It has totally changed my outlook toward taking any medication_ prescribed or not.

It certainly stops the allergy symptoms...but is that worth it if you can't stay awake?,If you have severe allergies_ it's worth a try.

This is very rare for me_ my nose normally runs constantly. Still trying to figure out the best way for me to use. This is what I do know - I use it only when I have severe stuffiness and sinus pain.

Horrible dreams at night.  Shouting in my sleep.  Just couldn't get a good night's sleep.  Today I realized it must be the spray.

This is after taking it at 2 p.m.! I still felt jittery well into the next morning. I cut back to half the dosage since my doctor said these side effects aren't typical. I still felt drowsy at first (I didn't even feel comfortable driving) and then the jitters came back. It wasn't as bad on half the dose_ but I also experienced little pains and a general weird_ tight feeling in my abdomen. I thought I was going crazy until I read the other reviews on this site.

I got about 20 minutes worth of work done and slept or watched TV the rest of the time.,I had so many things to do today and all I wanted to do was lay on the couch.

Sometimes it will feel like my lungs are filling with fluid and I cant stop coughing and I start to itch really bad under my chin. I'll then take Astelin and within minutes I can feel all the symptoms go away. I dont take it daily so perhaps that's why I don't have the side effects that others have mentioned.

I truly thought I was going to die.,F,38,1  days,9/14/2007,Astelin
174, 3, Allergies,Started taking 3 weeks ago. Drowsiness was my first symptom but the drowsiness tapered off to the point where a quick nap once a day made me feel much better. But these last two days have me concerned. I've had severe anger during situations that before would have been just annoyances. Came close to wanting to punch my son in the mouth and wanting to hit my wife. Not normal AT ALL for me. Came to search the web for Astelin and Allegra side effects because of this. Will talk with my allergist about another drug if this extreme swing in mood continues.,Astelin has improved my nasal problems due to allergies big time. Some days though are better than others with it_ and I don't do the recommended dosage. Only one spray per nostril twice a day instead of the two sprays. I take Atelin in combination with a single dose of Allegra once a day. If the unexplained anger wasn't an issue would have given the drug a 5 rating.,M,41,3  weeks,9/12/2007,Astelin

Eventually experienced heart palps_ numb hands_ numb feet_ prickling over my entire body.  I also started having trouble breathing and unusual constipation_ to where I did not ever feel hungry (food was not moving at all).,I'm concerned that I may have long-term effects having resulted from my use of astelin.  After having stopped use for a month_ my ears feel clogged and I occaisionally feel that my heart is racing for no reason.  I visited the doctor several times and they denied that Astelin could be a cause of my symptoms.  A week after stopping_ symptoms started to recede.  It's been a month now_ and I'm starting to experience some light headedness and ear pressure....,M,30,1  years,9/6/2007,Astelin

Sore_ raw throat_ as if something is stuck in the back of my throat_ probably swollen tissue. Heart palpitations and jitters during sleep.,It helped to slow down the post nasal drip_ but the trade-off of side-effects for the relief wasn't worth it.  I stopped taking Astelin after reading the other postings on this site_ which confirmed my side-effects.

The first time I took it_ I woke up suddenly at 4am with an anxiety attack so severe that I literally jumped out of my bed and started walking around my apartment in circles.  That has NEVER happened.  I waited a few days and tried it again.  Did not have an attack like that_ but found I was beginning to have more frequent anxiety_ which is not normal for me_ and also restless sleep_ heart palpitations_ feelings of sadness and just general not feeling well.,I have to say_ the drug did clear my nasal congestion_ but the side effects are not workable for me_ so I do not plan to take it.  I think doctors just go with what the pharmaceutical company tells them_ you the pharmco's just want to sell the product because my doctor is treating me for high blood pressure and I don't understand being given this drug otherwise!,F,49,3  days,5/21/2007,Astelin

Doesn't work too well. I try to avoid nasal sprays as they actually cause sinus infections when taken for extended periods of time. Allergies very bad due to spring so_ had to take something in addition to Zyrtec. Only used Astelin twice. Both times strange lack of sensation in tongue and lack of taste within 3 hrs of dosage (2puffs_ ea. nostril). Second time_ I developed ear and temple aches. Even my cheek bone started to hurt.

Also_ did not know that this was not good to combine with (baby doss) of Nortryptiline.  Too strong a reaction to make it worth continuing this one_ even if it helps with sinus decongestion.  How can the manufacturers allow all the side effects?  They are surprisingly severe for a medication like this one.,,F,64,2  days,5/12/2007,Astelin

I would quickly become dissatisfied with my hobbies_ my job_ my friends_ my life_ my house. I wanted to quit them all. This is not a usual state for me. I went off it and those feelings went away.

202, 2, Allergic/non-allergic rhinitis,When I first started using it_ it would knock me out immediately.  Eventually_ the effects weren't quite as extreme_ but it creates a bind: if I take it too late in the evening_ I am extremely groggy the next morning; if I take it too early in the evening_ I tend to get drowsy earlier than I would like.  Overall_ I think it has dampened my energy level.  I took this medication hoping it would relieve my allergy/sinus problems enough that I could return to being as physical active as I was a few years back.  If anything_ I have been even less active this current year than I was in the year before I started taking Astelin.Additionally_ ever since I started taking Astelin_ I have noticed that I much more frequently have difficulty recalling names and words.  (I realize I am getting older_ but it sure seems that the recall problems started after the Astelin.)Also_ I have gained some weight_ but if Astelin is the cause_ it may be more indirect (i.e._ it's made me less active_ theref,I have decided to discontinue using it.
