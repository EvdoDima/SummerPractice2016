0, 3, bipolar and sleep,I eat more. It takes forever to fall asleep but once im asleep I sleep til 10:30am.im drowsy during the first 2 hours I wake up. But during my sleep nothing can wake me up,Find the right dosage. If just for sleep xr wont help to fall asleep but aids in a deep sleep,F,37,1  years300mg,6/29/2016,Seroquel xr
1, 3, Bipolar depression,I took seroquel about 3 hours before going to bed_ about an hour after taking it my feet got externally annoyingly tingly on the bottoms I becam very irritable. When I fell asleep I fell into a fast deep sleep but felt like I couldn't move my body for some reason. I would wake up gasping for air. But I could move myself just felt like an elephant was sitting on me. My chest was a little uncomfortable as well. When I woke up at 10:45 am my mouth was very dry and my throat. And I feel dizzy like a mini hang over.,Last night was my first time taking it and I'm not sure if I am going to see any big changes yet_ hopefully they are good and don't put me through the horrible story's I've read. If you are considering taking it tread very lightly.,F,20,1  days300 MG,6/23/2016Email,Seroquel xr
2, 3, Sleep and depression,Extreme dry mouth_ tongue_ dental pain like bleeding gums and mouth sores.,It helped me sleep_ but the side effects were very concerning. Don't stop cold turkey_ I did that by mistake. I'm currently back on it to stabilize than I need to do a slow taper.,M,50,6  months100 MG,5/5/2016,Seroquel xr

4, 5, OCD,Certainly makes me sleepy_ so I take it at night before bed.  If I take it too late_ say around midnight and have to wake up at 6am_ I will have a very_ very sluggish morning.  Best bet for me is to take it and have 8 hours of sleep.  It's well tolerated_ I have no signficant side effects.  I went off of it for a few months a couple years back_ my anxiety hit me like a freight train_ so I went back on it.  No weight gain for me_ I eat well and exercise regularly.,This drug absolutely halts obsessive thoughts / thinking.  It slows my mind down and allows me to be more patient.  I take it in combination with 37.5 mg of Paxil XR.  These drugs literally have given me a quality of life I never thought was possible.,M,40,4  years150mg 1X D,4/9/2016,Seroquel xr
5, 1, Anxiety,I know I've only taken one dose_ but within an hour of taking it last night I had quite an extreme case of heartburn. Today if I eat the smallest amount of food it starts again. It did make me sleepy_ but I don't really have a sleeping problem. Today I feel so dizzy that every time I stand it feels like I'm on a boat that's rocking. I feel like I can't function.,,F,24,1  days25 mg,4/7/2016Email,Seroquel xr
6, 1, bipolar depression,Extreme tiredness_ zombie like effect_ itchieness_ mild memory loss,Despite sleeping well at night_ I was so tired I couldn't stay awake during the day. When not asleep i would just stare out the window or at computer screen. Total zombie effect - could not hold train of thought. Fell asleep at traffic light.  Ditched this awful drug after 4 days to avoid terrible withdrawals that have been reported. Two days later_ I feel great with minimal withdrawal.  Maybe I'm cured?!,M,51,4  days300 mg,3/8/2016,Seroquel xr
7, 5, Depression_ bipolar management,Tiredness_ sleeping a lot more than normal_,Works great for my depression and anxiety_ also helps me sleep. Overall I feel like a much calmer person thanks to the tranqilizing effects. Oversleeping was an issue until I adjusted to the medication.,M,23,1  years400,2/3/2016,Seroquel xr
8, 1, severe depression_  anxiety,Loss of appetite_  trouble sleeping_  panic attacks_  restlessness_  nausea_  upset stomach,I wouldn't wish the problems I've had with this medicine on my worst enemy.,F,34,1  weeks300 mg,1/27/2016,Seroquel xr
9, 5, Bipolar Disorder,I experience a mild degree of forgetfulness and a slight weight gain (like 10lbs),I love Seroquel. I started using it for Bioplar Depression and Hypomania. This is a magical drug!I would be dead if it wasnt for it. I've always stuggled with the constant highs and lows but now I finally feel stable and happy. I can enjoy things again. Like painting or drawing. I have the energy to live and purse school. It also helps me manage the stress of college.I wouldn't trade my Seroquel for any other drug.,F,18,2  years300mg,1/11/2016,Seroquel xr
10, 5, No,Weight gain,This drug saved my life! My suicidal rumination eventually subsided_ been on it a long time. They want me to start reducing it scared I will set off a trigger of suicide again.,F,47,1  days800mg,12/23/2015Email,Seroquel xr
11, 1, Depersonalization,,STAY THE F*** AWAY. Lobotomy in the form of a pill.,F,34,4  weeks300,12/14/2015,Seroquel xr
12, 5, PTSD_ OCD,Initially I tried 25mg to cope with agitation and obsessive rumination. It felt like someone had put ten pillows over my head. I liked the sedation but felt bombed. I found that chipping the pill instantly removed agitation and brought instant calm.,Great to relieve agitation. Calms the mind and loosens the tension in the body. Instantly reduces obsessive rumination. Start small to avoid feeling bombed. In tiny doses acts like a calmative without creating foginess so you can think clearly and function well. My idea of a wonder drug for anyone who responds poorly to stress. Great for anxiety and PTSD as blocks negative rumination loop and allows you to let bad thoughts go. I take it as needed like a mini tranquilliser rather than maintaining a regular dose. It caps my mood and stops negative spiralling of thoughts or physical agitation.,F,54,2  years5mg 1X D,10/23/2015Email,Seroquel xr
13, 2, Depression and Anxiety,Never hungry.But after a few days of not eatingI became very nauseated and couldn't keep any food down. I could barely walkAnd was shaking a lotAnd during the first few days I had an extreme brain fogs.,,F,14,2  weeks50mg,9/22/2015,Seroquel xr

18, 4, Bipolar/ insomnia,Excessive sleepiness in AM_ difficulty forming words_ difficulty with short term memory.,I would caution anyone to be very careful when taking Seroquel. It works wonders for me_ however I wouldn't take it purely for insomnia without psychotic or bipolar tendencies. It is simply too risky. The withdrawal from it is very intense_ do not go cold turkey_ you will be very ill. There also is a threshold between Ok_ and not being able to remember what the heck word I wanted to say_ and it could only be 50 mg away. Plus it can mess up your liver if you are not careful.,F,45,2  years350mg 1X D,2/3/2015Email,Seroquel xr
19, 1, Bipolar mixed episode,"The dr prescribed 25 mg at morning and noon and 200 at bedtime. As I filled the prescription late in the day_ I took the 200 mg at 10pm. I woke in the middle of the night to use the restroom- had to use the walls to hold me up- wandered to the kitchen and felt too ""drunk"" to get anything out of the package to eat. My alarm for work went off at 6 am. I couldn't even peel my eyes open... Still felt drunk. I woke again at 10:00am and showered but did not feel ""stable"" enough to drive and was still very tired. I payed back down and my husband had to wake me at 3pm...",Took one dose and never again- couldn't function and cost me a day of sick time as I couldn't go to work,F,30,1  days200 mg,1/18/2015,Seroquel xr
20, 1, extreme depression,Really tired I seemed drunk and high I felt even more depressed then before and had a higher thought of suicide,I got off at the meds and now I'm fine,F,26,3  years100,12/10/2014,Seroquel xr
21, 3, anxiety_ insomnia,Increased dosage myself and probably exceeded the 400 mg prn dosage prescribed (decrease in judgment was part of side effect) until unable to stand or walk. Doctor initially thought it was some form of generalized neurological disorder. Took at least 30 days to taper off of it during which time had trouble sleeping. Must take responsibility for increasing dosage myself (probably didn't exceed 600 mg_ however)_ but after discontinuing had improvement in mental alertness and generalized improvement in mood as well as an increase in energy.,Probably not a good drug for alcoholics and drug addicts_ because of tendency to self-medicate. Helps with insomnia and anxiety_ however.,,71,4  years400 mg,11/12/2014Email,Seroquel xr

23, 1, Doctor took AstraZeneca kickbacks,"WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!  Doctors take kickbacks from AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly to prescribe Seroquel and Zyprexa_ which will permanently destroy your memory_ cognition and ability to sleep_ cause you diabetes and high cholesterol.  THESE DRUGS KILL 42_000 PEOPLE A YEAR--and doctors are laughing all the way to the bank.  Who says crime doesn't pay?  The government has sued these companies for reimbursement because of Medicaid payments for these drugs.  I only had seizures and thought I was taking seizure meds_ and my doctor put me on 400 mgs of Seroquel and 15 mgs of Zyprexa daily for 9 years_ threw me on psych units when I had seizures_ put me in homes (his intent was to get my pensions and money)--I was unable to drive anymore_ work a computer_ I had no emotions_ I gained 40 pounds_ my life was destroyed.  Finally the decent doctor who diagnosed me with lupus 9 years later told me ""You're on some major antipsychotics"" and I was devastated.  I immediately got off them_ but 5 years",,F,60,9  years400 mgs 1X D,10/23/2014,Seroquel xr

25, 5, schizophrenia,This is so different to the original seroquel. Seroquel XR has changed my life around. This is the only antipsychotic that doesn't cause restlessness for me. I've been on it for 4 years. I highly recommend it.,,M,27,4  years800,8/5/2014,Seroquel xr
26, 3, Bipolar II Disorder/Panic Disorder,Initially while in the hospital I was put on Seroquel XR at 150mgs daily_ Oh wow_it was like being hit with an elephant tranquilizer. I walked around in a dazed like state for the duration of the hospital stay. I was technically feeling less depressed & anxious however it was because I was anesthetized basically. Once I arrived home I stopped the 150mgs & dropped down to 50mgs for a total of one day (I don't recommend it to anyone) The withdrawal on 1st Day was horrible do I titrated up to 100mgs per day & have been on this dose for the last 5 days & am much better. However my concern is_ during the first couple of days taking the 100mgs_ each day felt as though a heavy overwhelming weight was beginning to lift off me & I was mentally more clear_ and definitely responding better & better with each day. It was indescribable_the new sense of hope & possibility that I was beginning to have...I wanted to eat_I wanted to get up out of bed in the morning_ I wanted to live life once again after such a long time. But then yesterday & today the fog of depression has slowly moved back in_ I've become irritable & impatient. I don't quite understand what could be happening? Is fluctuations like this in the beginning to be expected? IF so_ when can I anticipate finally having balance? Could I have already acclimated to the dosing & am requiring a higher dose? Or is this normal?,,M,36,7  days100 mgs,7/30/2014Email,Seroquel xr
27, 5, Bipolar,This is a wonder drug for me. No more racing thoughts and my psychosis is quite. Believe it or not_ I have to take it when I first wake in the mornings. The antihistamine affect makes me restless in stead of sleepy.,,F,53,2  years600,7/7/2014,Seroquel xr
28, 4, Anxiety_ Sleeping problems_ etc,The first time I took this felt like a shot of the world's most powerful elephant tranquilizer_ it was beyond anything ever imaginable..Good thing I was staying somewhere with doctors nearby_ probably would have given myself a heart attack. But the next night was better_ wasn't long after that I could take it and fall asleep an hour later.,,M,32,3  weeks100 1X D,3/30/2014Email,Seroquel xr
29, 4, I have bipolar,Non xr was good for this time. But I was unable to cope when my passed away on this dose cause the alcohol amount made it obsolete.so if you c signs of unwellness need to c psychiatrist.,,F,37,2  years30 mg,3/29/2014,Seroquel xr
30, 5, Manic/Anxiety & Depression/Insomnia,Dry mouth.  Groggy in the morning for a few days_ but that went away.  Slight loss of appetite.  Slightly agitated in the early evening before next dose_ but that went away_ too.  Good side effects:  Killed the manic episode and let me go to sleep (finally!).  No more racing thoughts 24/7.  I can actually meditate now.  I'm able to get up and go to work!  I haven't missed a day of work since I started this med_ which is very unusual for me.,I was terrified to try this medicine after reading all of the negative reviews.  Unfortunately_ the very people who are prescribed this drug are the ones most likely to be extra-sensitive to negative side effects.  I'm certainly in that group.  But I'm glad I gave it a shot.  I also take Lexapro 10mg.  The extended-release version of seroquel doesn't PUT me to sleep; it LETS me go to sleep. Big difference.  The main issue that bothers me (and this is kind of petty) is that I have to take it (1) one hour before I eat; (2) three to four hours before I want to go to bed; and (3) twelve hours before I want to wake up.  Whew!  That's a pain in the ass!  So_ my schedule is this:  take pill at 6:30 pm_ eat dinner at 7:30 pm_ get up for work at 6:30 am.  I hate following this strict schedule_ but you have to choose your battles and the strict schedule is better than being bat-shit crazy.  I haven't gained any weight_ but I'm a mostly-vegan vegetarian that only eats healthy food.  I don't eat any junk at all...no refined sugar/bread/pasta/fast food/soda blah blah blah you get the picture.  I hope the dry mouth issue improves...the other night I drank 32 ounces of water THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT as I was trying to sleep...which of course led to having to get up to pee-pee!  Not cool!,F,47,3  weeks300 MG 1X D,2/28/2014Email,Seroquel xr
31, 4, Mania,No side effects except it makes it hard to get out of bed in the morning if I take my dose too late the evening before. My doctor said take the dose 12 hours before you wake up. i find that taking it 14 hours before my wake up hours curbs the sedating side effect. (I take it at 6 p.m. and wake at 8 a.m.),Seroquel XR was prescribed as an alternative to Zyprexa_ because Zyprexa was causing me to eat everything in sight and gain an unseemly and dangerous amount of weight. I notice a slight uptick in appetite with Seroquel XR_ but nothing compared to Zyprexa. the appetite increase is so much more manageable. It does not make me feel quite as good (rosy_ optimistic) as Zyprexa but it does the trick of quelling my mania and keeping me in a pretty good headspace. I take this with 600 mgs Lithium XR.  Combine this med with conversation from wise friends or counselors. I learned I still need to correct thinking errors to feel much better. I learned to quit personalizing others' mistreatment of me_ for instance.,F,36,21  days150 1X D,2/6/2014Email,Seroquel xr
32, 1, Bipolar Depression and Insomnia,Side effects experienced with SEROQUEL: Worst drug ever. Takes (3-5) hours to put you to sleep. Than you have horrible nightmares and remember all your bad dreams the following morning. Does not improve depression at all_ makes it worse! The XR version will make you completely incapacitated the following morning to the point where you can't even move your body; literally. Completely halts the effect of stimulants like Vyvanse used for major depression and enabling you to get out of bed in the morning. Worst sleep aid on the market and no patient assistance programs exist. Also terribly expensive. Consider another antipsychotic such as Abilify or Saphris_ you'll be glad you did. Plus Abilify and Saphris and Vyvanse will give them to you for free if your income is low enough; generally under ($25_000 annually).,,M,31,2  months200 MG,2/4/2014Email,Seroquel xr
33, 3, Bipolar disorder (yay!!),Frequent nosebleeds_ tiredness_ sleepiness in the morning and before night (since I took it at 4PM daily)_ slower than normal thinking.,Seroquel makes me calmer_ helps me sleep_ and for some unknown reason cures my eczema. It did not help me with anxiety/paranoia though. It considerably increased my appetite. I cannot stop eating!:),M,28,7  days100 1X D,11/13/2013,Seroquel xr
34, 1, insomnia,Cannot concetrate during day and other problems.After 4-5 years of use I now has breathing problems that are probably related to dysautonomia and brain damage (brainstem). One has to discontinue these medications before 4 years or something or one will die to medication side-effects.,Seroquel IR 400mg/night didn't cause problems. Switching to the prolong (XR) caused concetration problems and other issues which disappeared when I switched medication back to Seroquel IR 400mg/night.,M,32, 400 1X D,6/29/2013,Seroquel xr

36, 1, Psychotic Depression,Legs hurt_ not helping my psychotic symptoms_ crippling depression,This has been the worst point of my life in what has been the worst year of my life. I was on Olanzapine (10mg) which stopped working effectively_ and I switched to Seroquel slow release tablets three days ago. I am ashen. This is destroying me_ I've never felt so awful before in my entire life. I'm not even sure I'm going to make it. This medication may work for you_ but for me it has turned my life into a living hell. Think VERY carefully before trying it when your current medication is working (even though mine wasn't).,M,24,3  days50 MG 1X D,6/17/2013Email,Seroquel xr
37, 4, Bipolar II,Initially very dry mouth but this went away. Weight gain.,This drug was a miracle for me. It balanced out my mood brilliantly and helped me sleep.

40, 5, PTDS,Very few at all - I take it a few hours before bed so if anything it helps me sleep.   I have noticed some minor weight increase (1lb) but time will tell if this is a trend.   Overall_ I feel great.,I started taking this medication for PTSD and it worked like a miracle.   It calmed me down_ it stopped my racing thoughts_ it stopped my obsessivness_ and it helped me sleep.   For me it was truly a miracle medication.     I worry about possible weight gain but I will just exercise more.,M,37,1  months200mg 1X D,3/12/2013Email,Seroquel xr

42, 1, bi-polar disorder,excessive sleep_ slowed speech_ troubles making sentences_ forgetting words_ short-term memory loss_ emotionless_ fatigue_ weight gain,I stopped taking Seroquel XR almost 2 years ago. I weaned myself off it over a weeks period and had the most horrible withdrawals following the last days dosage that lasted another week. I couldn't sleep_ had difficulties breathing_ night sweats_ vomiting_ extreme nausea_ headache_ etc. I wish I'd never taken this medicine. I've never regained my once strong short-term memory. I feel I've never been as sharp as I once was. Life on Seroquel XR is like watching a television that has been muted. It's like being a zombie. I tried to explain to my psychiatrist the difficulties I was having and he didn't believe me! He also didn't believe me about the withdrawal symptoms. I say_ please use this drug only as a last resort.,F,28,2  years800 1X D,2/17/2013Email,Seroquel xr

Weight gain and involuntary muscle tighting and movement have been my biggest issue.,I really like the way this med has improved my moods and anxiety. However I'm not sure I'm willing to continue due to the weight gain and involuntary muscle movements. They are very distruptive when trying to sit still.

Hard to say what SE's are due to what.)  Sedating.,"Intrusive thoughts are almost completely absent_ where they were once a daily event_ sometimes all day.  The mood swings are intense but include really joyful spells_ which is fun.  I had no joy at all_ before.  Just flat.  Nothing.  Great motivation to do stuff_ again.  It's like I care about stuff more.  Whereas I was totally ""uh huh_ whatever_"" before.  Seroquel is definitely sedating.  Which is a good thing_ for me.

I will say that Seroquel is a great sleep medication and did knock out my last mixed episode.  I take it all at night so once the morning grogginess wears off (at 9 or 10 am) I am fine.,F,41,6  months150/100 mg 1X D,11/16/2012,Seroquel xr

My psych told me the XR version wouldn't give me the morning hangover; HA wrong!  At times it could take me upto an hour to fully wake up and a few times I was late to work because of this.  But DID really help with the depression I was going thru at the time.  True it knocked me out bigtime_ but that was trivial compared to the positive effects I saw.  Decided to get off it because of the drowsiness_ but now thinking of talking to my new psych about re-starting it.,M,29,16  months300 1X D,11/8/2012,Seroquel xr
51, 1, Depression,My 14 year old daughter suffers from depression and only got partial relief from taking 60 mg of fluoxetine. She also has difficulty sleeping at night. Her psychiatrist wanted her to try Seroquel XR for weeks but I was leery because this medication is only FDA approved for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Also_ the side effects that this medication carries can be heavy. Unfortunately after weeks of convincing_ we agreed to try 50 mg of Seroquel XR before bed. The next day my daughter could hardly get out of bed. She could not think straight_ was dizzy_ and felt more depressed than ever. She also kept having chills though she had no sign of any illness such as fever_ swollen glands_ etc.. While she did sleep all night with the 50 mg dose_ she was in terrible shape the entire next day. I would never give this to her again.,,F,14,1  days50 MG,10/12/2012,Seroquel xr
52, 3, Bipolar I Disorder,Probably gained 50 pounds on this med.  I also got a very rare side effect called Pisa Syndrome(google it)  From the waist up I lean to the left.  Not that noticeable but you can see it.  It is caused exclusively by long term exposure to antipsychotics.  I had to have an MRI and had to educate my psychiatrist on Pisa Syndrome_ he had never heard of it.,Doctors are writing scripts for this pharmaceutical superstar for everything under the sun.  I've read that some doctors will call it a sleeping pill at low doses.  This is not a sleeping pill_ it's an AAP and you should know that.  I have three problems with it_ you can double your body weight in a year_ not everyone but it happens.  You can get Diabetes regardless of weight gain.  You can get a weird side effects like the one I listed.  I am now on disability and I'm dropping Seroquel because it would cost $550 for 30 300mg tablets.

53, 5, Bipolar,Just sleepiness and weight gain about 5-10 pounds I cannot seem to take off with diet and exercise.  A very small price to pay for my sanity.,I was suffering before I started taking this drug.

56, 4, major depression,Weight gain.  Drowsiness.,I've started taking 50 mg 2 hours after I wake up in the morning_ then I take another 50 mg tablet every 3 hours afterward.  I've noticed I don't feel as spaced out and groggy in the morning and during the day with this method.  At around 6pm this evening I will try cutting one 50 mg tablet in half to see if I go to sleep earlier and wake up easier with less groginess.  I use to take 150 mg at around 3pm.  But_ I would still feel groggy in morning and the med would wear off before it's time to take it again.  This new method is working for me better with XR.  I don't feel as sleepy and spacey during the day.  So_ here's what I'm doing:  50mg at 8:30a.m._ 50mg at 11:30am_ 50mg at 2:30pm_ then cut 50 mg in half at 6:00pm and go to bed soon after.

The downside of that was laziness_ I could not get motivated. I have to choose between uncomfortably numb or my hectic mind. Also_ at bedtime I would start JOLTING and had to jerk my limbs around excessively for well over an hour. So not only was I very sleepy because of the dose_ I was jerking around like a crazy person. I still feel this sensation in my arms. Also_ my muscles got very weak_ to the point of barely being able to bear my own body weight.

64, 1, ,Inability to focus ETC.,"Seroquel IR is BETTER than Seroquel XR. You take single Seroquel IR tablet before bedtime and you are  clear the next day. With Seroquel XR you just become lazy toad.DO NOT USE SEROQUEL XR. It is only ""better"" by shutting your brain off.Seroquel IR + Omega3 to protect brain isn't very harmful (and all of these drugs are nearly toxic. Psychiatry is FRAUD_ it is NOT HELPING YOU (in general there IS NO neurological reasons for mental health problems AND there are BETTER and SAFER ways of improving brain function [hopefully])).These DRUGS and TOXIC and SPECULATIVE. Not a single measurement is taken. These drugs are used to SHUT YOU OFF in few years (or sometimes immediately).If you want to use Seroquel IR instead of Seroquel XR just split Seroquel XR tablets to 2-3 pieces and take them as a single tablet. This SHOULD break the continuous release effect in seroquel XR.Basically if you are taking Seroquel (or any other of these drugs) the chances are that you are screwed by doctors/society who want you to get ""better"". NEVER START THESE TOXIC DRUGS VOLUTANRILY. Withdrawal kills (Seroquel < 25mg maybe not): excess brain activity + spinal cord_ inflammatory/cytokine problems in body etc. Seroquel (and other atypicals) are serotonin 5-HT2A receptor blockers.",M,100,2  years400 1X D,2/2/2012,Seroquel xr

Cant have late nights anymore or anything as I am so tired for days after. Feel it is causing general ware and tare on the body_ so looking to swap to something else long term. However keeps mental health at a level where I can enjoy life_ do a part time job and see friends so cant complain too much.,I was taking normal seroquel_ but they changed me to the xr version as it can be taken once per day. The only down side is it doesnt put you to sleep like the immediate release_ so if you are using the immediate release to help sleep. I would say dont bother changing becuase I am still sluggish through the day on the XL plus still fat too! However I get extreme side effects when trying other drugs and seroquel for me doesnt do anything bad_ if you are taking it at first it may make you inable to function as you will be a zombie but I found this does ware off_ if you are still a zombie after a month or two and have been completely stable for a while_ ask if you can drop the dose a bit_ a small reduction makes a massive difference. I can lead a fulfilling life while taking this drug_ I was completely psychotic a few years ago and now I can go free of symptoms for months_ just left with slight highs and lows due to the bipolar.,F,29,3  years250mg 1X D,1/3/2012,Seroquel xr

I would be on my couch crying my eyes out for hours and then *poof* I would be incredibly happy_ wanting to talk and talk to others_ acting as if I had not a care in the world.Since starting Seroquel_ I have yet to hit another extreme low. While I may still become agitated_ I am able to slow down and figure out what it is I am feeling rather than being a different person every hour. Seroquel has slowed my emotions enough so I am able to function and think properly. Working_ dealing with money and general life planning is possible because I have far more stability than I had before. My partner also says he notices that I am more stable as a whole and he no longer has to wonder what mood I will be in throughout the day.

The depression was caused in large part by continuous ruminations about my (both real and imagined) past mistakes. I went to visit a psychiatrist because of strong suicidal thoughts and he immediately put me on seroquel. By now (a month afterwards) my depression has lifted completely and I feel happy again being alive. Talking a lot about my problems was very important in helping me recover_ but I think that the seroquel also helped. I was surprised to discover (after reading the other reviews on this website) that seroquel has such strong negative effects on so many people_ because the seroquel doesn't seem to affect myself very strongly. For me the side-effects are very minimal and the mental effects are very subtle. During the first week in which I took seroquel I didn't notice any change in my mental state what so ever.

104, 5, Bipolar Disorder 1,The only side effect is a slight increase in apetite when taking my meds and sleepiness 3-4 hours after intake. I take them at night so the sleepiness is a welcomed effect.,Nothing short of a miracle. I've been switched from Risperdal and Depakote to this and it's been uphill from there.

105, 2, To regulate sleep cycles,I have gained 20+ pounds and my weight continues to inch up.  I was prescribed XR as it seemed that the regualr Seroquel (which I had been taking for 7 years) was no longer effective.  Initially XR didn't seem as effective_ but then it started working.  I don't feel as well rested as I did with regular Seroquel and the weight gain is bothering my joints and arthritis.,I am going to discontinue use and see what happens.

106, 1, Bipolar II,Lethargy_ weight gain,I was initially treated for depression and took prozac_ cymbalta_ and zoloft (at different times).  Each one made me suicidal.  I was then diagnosed at bipolar II.  I started at 75mg and felt great for a week.  It helped me stop the cymbalta cold turkey.  Then it stopped working for me_ so my doc upped the dose to 150mg.  I was useless.  I couldn't get out of bed or mentally wake up until 6pm then had to take another pill 3 hours later.  I was extremely hungry and I gained 10 lbs.  I quit cold turkey and feel better with no meds even though I can feel my mood swings at least I'm awake and can concentrate.  I found they actually prescribe some people this drug for sleep and there is no problem stopping cold turkey.

108, 3, Bipolar I/Insomnia,Since I have been on Seroquel XR_ I have had some problems with Akathisia (uncontrolled muscles twitches)_ and for the only time in my life_ my cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been terrible.  It has also significantly increased my blood sugar. I have also had problems with my weight (gain of 60lbs) but I don't know if that's from the depakote or the seroquel.,Although the Seroquel has helped with my depression and sleep and we are using it to help wean me off the depakote_ I do not like the idea of it affecting my lipid levels and blood sugar the way it has_ and am terrified that because I seem to be so sensitive to the medication that it will begin to affect my liver as well.  I do not know what path my doctor plans on taking at this point_ but I think that the risks and side effects have slightly outweighed the benefits.,F,25,8  months200mg 1X D,3/13/2010,Seroquel xr

I complained long enough and finally got the dosage dropped to 75mg and now I'm not a zombie anymore but the anxiety has returned.  Still_ the doctor say_ ""give it a little more time.""  I think I was better unmedicated...lol.",F,29,3  months,12/22/2009,Seroquel xr
114, 5, Borderline Personality_ Anxiety,I take 600 milligrams of Seroquel XR which is a relatively high dose_ yet compared to the standard Seroquel the side-effects are much better.  On the XR I don't have the hunger and weight gain nearly as bad.  The sedation is only mild and is much less than the immediate-release drug.  The way you take it about 3 to 4 hours before bed is perfect to get really restful sleep.  I wake up energized and bright every morning.,Another nice benefit I've noticed is that the XR version of Seroquel is actually a bit cheaper than regular Seroquel.  The XR is awesome for anxiety because it stays with me all the time and doesn't wear off like Risperdal_ Zyprexa_ or Geodon.  Seroquel XR also has FDA approval as an antidepressant_ and I can really tell it is bringing me out of some deep_ hard-to-detect depression symptoms.  Overall_ I think this is my favorite drug I have ever taken.  I can't wait till 2011 when it goes generic (regular Seroquel_ don't know about XR version).,M,27,2  months,12/3/2009Email,Seroquel xr
115, 2, GAD_ panic_ social phobia,From the first day on very drowsy and lethargic. Locked up in my own world. Loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. Scary heart palpations and chest pain. Orthostatic hypotension.,I was only on 50 mg XR and although Seroquel managed to stop my negative thoughts for the better part_ it also robbed me from all the positive emotions. I felt completely drugged the whole day and I couldn't care less about the world outside. At day 5 I got this chest pain and a very irregular heart beat and since I have a history of heart disease I had to quit immediately. Also without the irregular heart beat I don't think that I would have continued Seroquel. If the price that you have to pay to get rid of your anxiety is a complete loss of emotions_ sexual dysfunction and a complete loss of initiative_ I'd rather prefer to stay with a low dose of Xanax to help me through those difficult moments. This is a very serious medicine and I really wonder if it should be FDA approved for GAD/anxiety.,M,55,5  days,11/14/2009Email,Seroquel xr
116, 1, bipolar,I hate Seroquel and doctors who prescribe it.  Chance of diabetes.  Increases by 60%,terrible side effects_ weight gain_ hunger.

I've gone from not being able to work to seriously multi-tasking. The real test is how I'll be while employed. I'm having to take Cogentin b/c I'm allergic to the Seroquel XR. I'm able to drink caffeine without becoming anxious. But my anxiety is usually work related. We shall see how this goes.,F,27,1  months,10/2/2009,Seroquel xr
118, 1, mood stabilization/bipolar/sleep,25 weight gain_ sugar craving_ daytime sleepiness/zombie effect_ no sex drive.,"I had also commented on regular Seroquel and what it had done to me - jacked up my blood sugar and also had me eating three ice cream bars in one sitting.  Doc also had me on 200mg of XR during the day. I've given up both and put myself both on the Wellbutrin SR I had laying around in my medicine cabinet. I tried to call in refills for it and bastard doctor will not refill it. He instead sent me this ""special rate"" card from the Seroquel mfg with a script for 600 mgs of the sh*t a day because he insists I'm ""agitated."" OF COURSE I'M AGITATED! We're in a recession and I'm in a sh*t job where management froze salaries_ is threatening layoffs_ plays favorites with an employee who doesn't do her job and makes the rest of the staff do her job for her. The Seroquel XR only made me depressed the first time around to where I never wanted to do anything after work or leave the house on weekends. Now I'm on the Wellbutrin I've taken up roller skating and doing it 3-4 times a week. I'm also  beginning to let the employee favoritism slide. The receptionist can screw herself and so can the psychiatrist with his so-called expert opinion because this prescription is not getting filled and the next time I see him I am going to insist on my Wellbutrin because I know if I gave it up_ any motivation to skate or do anything else would go down the drain.

Overall I tend to be more even-tempered than I used to be_ and I can fall asleep (usually) quicker.  Overall_ I would say the medication is doing what it was intended without much problems in nasty side effects_ and it's helping me get into a place where I can deal with my impulsiveness as a result of the ADHD.",M,24,7  days,8/16/2009Email,Seroquel xr
123, 4, Not taking Seroquel Rep Here,Many companies choose to do xr later in order to extend patent. There r though benefits. Regualar ser. causes your plasma concentration to peak rapidly after taking and then drops rapidly causing the sedation. XR is slowly released over a 24 hr pd and peaks 3-4 hrs after taking. If you go to sleep @ 11 take at about 7. It does not peak until about this time so any sedation will occur while you are already in bed. It then reaches steady state instead of the plasma level dropping thus a little more manageability of sedation/orthostatic hypotension (dizziness). Any slow release is a little cleaner regarding side effects. Weight gain is an avg of4-6 pds. Occassionally you may gain more. It is due to histamine blockade. Also if your dr. is not getting you to 300mg for dep. and 6-800 for mania it will not do anything but make you sleepy. It works on neurepinephrine_ dopamine and serotonin at 3-400mg. Anything less is just causing sedation thur histamine blkade.,Invega only works on dopamine and and a receptor that is pt. of the serotonin family. Ser xr wks (at correct dose) on dopamine_ serotonin and neurepinephrine. The neurep.blkade allows it to treat depressive bipolar symptoms as well as manic and schizophrenia. Others in the class do not wk on neuepinephrine a major contributor to the dep. episodes. Ser and xr also bind much less tightly to dopamine so you won't see the akathisia_ restless leg (inner restlessness_ movement disorders) etc seen with others that bind more tightly to dopamine.,M,42, ,8/4/2009,Seroquel xr
124, 3, Schizophrenia,What does XR in Seroquel mean.  Is it more effective then regular Seroquel.  Is it like Invega extended release tablets aka Risperdal's son.  I heard the extended release versions on these drugs are nothing but patent extenders.  Does anyone have any idea if the extended release is more effective.  Many doctors seem not to be prescribing these medicines over the regular versions.,Does the XR version still give you the weight gain.  I have not been prescribed this yet.  Does it just dissolve in the body at a slower rate making it better?  I do not see the advantages vs the regular.  Are the side effects better with the extended release versions?,M,30,6  months,7/18/2009,Seroquel xr
125, 5, bi polar,the main side effect is sedation. Though I have titrated up to 200 mg during the day_ I started with 400mg at night. Now I take a total of 600 mg.,The medication has given me relief with my mania_ agitation and mood stability. I still feel some depression_ but it has become  managable. It has also helped me control my moods to the extent that I no longer self harm. I would recommend people try it_ but be very careful_ it is a powerful medicine.,F,50,1  years,5/10/2009,Seroquel xr
