0, 5, BAM prev. diagn.IBS postfundoplicat,Have followed a strict FODMAP diet which helped but actually only masked real problem . Fearsome aches and nausea and D say 2 x a week. Since Questran have been fine. Had it made into capsules which I experiment  with all at once or over day .,Couldn't swallow sachet in liquid_ so chemist made up capsules. 8 =sachet. Get a bit of flatulence. Feel stronger and more cheerful not having chronic D. Have eaten ordinary bread and forbidden FODMAP veggies and NO PROBLEMS. Annoyed re wrong diagnosis_ glad to have found Questran. Praise GI dr. Worry re possible vitamin deficit though.,F,63,20  days4g  sachet 1X D,11/4/2015Email,Questran
1, 5, Bile acid malabsorption,Indigestion,When I was diagnosed a year ago_ a 4mg sachet of questran light daily worked immediately. After two months I was getting constipation so I reduced gradually to one sachet every three days_ then stopped altogether. However when the diarrhoea returned two months ago_ I had to rack the dosage up to five sachets a day to control it. This is tricky to know when to take the questran_ as I am on other drugs which are affected by it. After a month I have been able to cut down gradually to one sachet a day. So I am hoping to be off it completely soon. As we al know this is not a pleasant medicine to swallow....but it works.,F,74,2  months4 to 20 mg,5/25/2015Email,Questran
2, 5, bile salt malabsorption,Money grittyNone,To gritty I rinse immediately after wait one hour before brushing to prevent black teeth.Dont hold it in your mouth for any length of time.,F,65,10  days4gm 3 time,4/19/2015,Questran
3, 5, Bile Reflux_ Bile Diarrhea,A little flatulence_ but otherwise good. Can be constipating.,I take 1/4 packet in the evening when I have an active flare of symptoms. It seems to reduce the severity and firms the stool so that I am not running to the bathroom.,F,49,30  days1/4 pkt 1X D,2/24/2015,Questran
4, 5, gallbladder removal,constipation_ bloating and gas at first but immediately relieved the D. Once correct dosage was attained no more constipation and gas and bloating dissipated as well. recently had to up my dose to 1 scoop 2x a day and i am experienceing bloating and gas again. not sure why and will be seeing my gastro doc soon about it. possibly my increase in eating unhealthy_ fatty foods increased my bile dumping? not sure. I have noticed i get short dizzy spells occasionally after taking the medicine. Also i get cramping if i don't eat something when i take the medicine. after prolonged use i have vitamin deficiencies and muscle cramps from lack of vitamin D.,i have found a juice that makes this medicine easy to take! it's Old Orchard berry blend 100% juice! i have searched far and wide to find something to make this tolerable. I love this medicine and have been living a normal life for over a year and a half before i recently had issues again and had to up my dose(which may have been eating habits i don't know yet). But if i miss a dose_ i will have D. This is a miracle for me. the only down fall of this medicine is the fact it reduces your absorption of fat soluble vitamins like A_ K_ E_ D. So now i am on a RX strength vitamin D supplement and have my other vitamins tested. if you start having body aches and your legs feel like RLS it MAY be vitD deficiency!,F,27,18  months1 scoop 2X D,2/22/2015,Questran
5, 5, IBS-D,Body aches_ and most recently I believe it is the cause of bad muscle cramping in arms and legs due possibly to low Potassium,I have to say that I dont like the muscle cramping.  Its just like you have been physically exerting yourself all day and not drinking any water and then getting the cramps.But I have to say_ I have had very bad IBS D since I was about 19 years old.  My Gastro immediately had me start Questran and without it_ I would not be able to function.  Literally_ I would not be able to hold down a job or have a life.  Its a great drug that works for IBS D.  I have tried many others and none compare.,M,48,26  years3 packets 3X D,10/28/2014Email,Questran

Over say the last 7 yrs lived with uncontrolable *D*_ had no idea why. Did all possible tests_ and had both ends looked into. By accident I read about bile salts_ asked Dr for Questran. Problem cured within days with only taking 30gm.,F,58,2  months30mg 1X D,12/4/2011,Questran
8, 1, Extreme diarrhea,I had taken two days of Questran---but only 1/4 of the amount prescribed.  I had horrible nose bleeds_ but thought there was no way they could be related so continued taking Questran.  I was unable to eat any citrus fruit any fruit juices without vomiting while taking Questran. Three weeks later_  I took 3/4 of a dosage as I was still having diarrhea.  Within four hours_ I was bleeding from my nose_ my tongue_ my genitals (as bad as a period!).  I scheduled a doctor's appointment and decided not to take anymore Questran.,"I took two doses of Pepto-Bismol 13 hours later hoping that I would be over the diarrhea enough to make it to the doctor the next day.  Instructions said to wait approx. two to four hours before taken other drugs and it had been thirteen.  Within an hour_ I had a drug interaction of vomiting for six hours along with diarrhea all night.  It took me two hours online to discover that Pepto-Bismol and Imodium can cause ""moderate"" side effects if having had Questran---but nothing about 13 hours later!  I ended up in the hospital. Questran initially seemed to work for me_ but it gradually stopped working and I have been advised to never take it again.",F,59,30  days1 scoop 2X D,12/3/2011Email,Questran

10, 4, Severe IBS-D,Starting to get concerned after the period of time I have been taking questran.  Headaches about everyday_ bad muscle aches_ vertigo_ ringing in ears_ bad restless leg syndrome.  These symptoms have really only appeared in the last year or so and have gotten bad real fast.  I think it is time to seek alternative remedies.,This drug in the beginning was a life save_ still is I guess.

11, 5, crohns,None,This has helped improve my quality of life 100%.  I used to have to starve myself so that I would be able to go somewhere without too much worry about needing the toilet.

14, 3, Crohn's,I've been on Questran for 19 years due to 3 feet of my illium had been reomoved due to Crohns. It works great for fewer bowel movements. I eat an extremely healthy diet_ do cardio_ & lift weights. For the last 5 years my blood work consistently had supper low cholesterol_ but my good cholesterol was also low. Each year my triglycerides have increase. My triglycerides are now 320 & my doctor wants to put me on additional medicine. I have read that some side effects for Quesran are high tryglycerides_ so I stoped taking Questran & now take 20+ grams of fiber.

18, 5, diarrhea (gall bladder removed),mild constipation and gas when I first started taking it,I had severe diarrhea after having my gall bladder removed. My doctor tried me on something else that didn't help_ but when someone I know recommended Questran_ I asked my doctor about it. She put me on it_ and it's worked great!

19, 5, Born with a meconium ileus; ++ dia-,Constipation_ but much better than diarreha!,My daughter has been taking Questran since she was a year old.

Hope she can do it!,F,8,7  years,8/16/2007,Questran
20, 5, Microscopic colitis (lymphocytic),gas at first,I had been on bismuth for 3 weeks with this last bout of colitis when I started this. I've gone from 15 episodes a day to 2. I take 4 scoops a day. Three are taken immediately before the first bite of a meal_ one at night. This appears to bind with bile and causes it to be excreted instead of recycled by the liver as happens 95% of the time normally. If your bile has become toxic from whatever brought on your colitis (like gluten)_ this drug causes the liver to make new clean bile. Your colon can then heal. For colitis_ there's more to this drug than just having the counterbalance of causing constipation. Taking it just before meals in important so that it gets to the bile.,M,63,3  weeks,3/6/2007,Questran
21, 5, Crohn's,You need to experiment with the dosage at first as too much and you might not be going to the toilet for a while. It binds you up.,"It has transformed my life.

My bowel movements were ""normal"" and have been ever since I've been taking this.",F,25,1  years,2/6/2007,Questran
22, 5, crohns disease,There are no noticable side effects.  it just stops the number of bowel movements per day,I take 1/2 package of powder a day and it releaves my diarrhea.  This medication does not reduce inflammation caused by crohns_ but it does help keep your life normal.  I also take this with Imodium.   I stopped taking all of those harmful drugs 12 years ago against my doctors advice.  I haven't needed surgery and I feel great.  Don't believe everything your Doctor says. Those drugs they perscribe for you are harmful.  If you have tried everything else then you don't have a choice_ but please try other methods.  before questran I would have b/w 12-20 movements a day now I have 1 or 2.,F,39,12  years,11/7/2006,Questran

24, 4, Crohns Disease,Use this for illeoceal valve removal during surgery over decade ago.  Works well for Diarreha.  Powerful pain meds work better for D*.  This med I use on occasion when severe D*.,This med binds to other meds causing them to not be absorbed.  Must be carefully planned out on when to take.  Best time for me_ about half way through a course of 8 hour sleep.  Wake_ take this_ back to bed.  Works well.,M,33,1  years,7/6/2005,Questran
