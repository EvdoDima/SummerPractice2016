45, 1, GERD and EE,Helped GERD within 12 hours. But around 24 hours started noticing abdominal pain like prickly stickers in my gut that were rolling around but not going any where. Then had a BM and the gut pain seemed to be worse. Went ahead and took 2nd dose yesterday afternoon. I was miserably all last night with cramping & pain and was intensified on the left side and even felt like a knife cut through me when I walked. I didn't take another dose today and my abdomen still hurts & is even sensitive to touch_ laid up in bed and now have a low grade fever with no appetite. (Nexium put  nine pounds on me in SIX weeks. That's why I was given Dexilant samples.) Any way_ done with it. Went to the health food store today for slippery elm and licorice and probiotics. I figure it can't be any worse than the side effects from the scripts. The abdominal pain is still so bad I'll be at the walk-in tomorrow if it hasn't let up. Good Luck to you guys!,,F,55,2  days60mg a day,7/11/2014,Dexilant

47, 3, GERD/excess stomach acid,None_ so far.,I am 32 with severe GERD and excessive stomach acid_ it's been this way since I was a child. I have been on basically every other anti-reflux medication that exists over the years. You name it_ and I've been on it. Anyway up until about a month ago I had been on Protonix_ but it just randomly quit working one day. I have been in severe discomfort since. My gastro tried me on Nexium first_ and then I suggested Dexilant. I was a little skeptical since it's just a once a day medication...and I hate to say it but my skepticism was correct. It works so-so_ but by the end of the day I find myself dealing with heartburn_ and lying down to go to sleep most nights is pure torture. At this point I don't know what is left to try. I don't think there are any stronger PPI's on the market at the moment. I will continue the Dexilant because it is better than nothing at all_ but this is definitely not an ideal situation. Thank God I see my gastro in 2 days.,F,32,2  weeks60mg 1X D,6/24/2014Email,Dexilant

61, 2, Hiatal hernia and GERD,Given Dexilant for acid reflux and hiatal hernia -Nexium stopped working after 15 years.   It completely got rid of the hernia pain and reflux but the explosive diarrhea is not worth it. I lost 7 lbs  in a week from the diarrhea. Doc took me off and put me in antibiotic and anti diarrheal meds in case I had an infection. Got better gradually over the course. Started Dexilant again and within 12 hours_ the same explosive diarrhea was back. I've now lost another 3 lbs in 4 days due to this diarrhea reaction.   I will have to find something else to relieve the hernia and gerd pain. Very disappointed.,,F,44,1  days60 mg,5/25/2013,Dexilant
62, 5, Chronic GERD for about 4 years,No side effects,My GERD was so bad I was waking up at night with my stomach on fire and projectile vomiting. Endoscopies and gastroenterologist were useless.so were all the meds which eventually seemed like they made the situation worse so I stopped taking them. My GP finally gave me a sample of dexilant..  I took it for 3 months and then my insurance company decided I didn't need it.  I haven't had a twinge of heartburn since the first capsule and I have been off the meds for 2 months.  I lost 50 pounds because I didn't have to keep eating to help the pain and feel like I have my life back. Truly a miracle drug for me!

64, 4, Acid reflux / hiatel hernia,Hives and rash,I first took dexilant as a sample from my gastro. Worked wonderful. Then got a refill and two days later broke out in a rash/ hives that was like having poison ivy all over my body. I did not know that it was the dexilant at the time that caused my hives because I had taken the samples with no side effects. I suffered with this hives_ rash for 5 months. I was going to the dermatologist weekly trying to find the problem_ then I stopped taking all medicines_ changed foods _ drinks_ washing powders_ soap etc trying to figure out what I was allergic to. I finally thought I had it figured out and decided it was a natural drink I was drinking that had vitamins in it. I Had to take a dose of prednisone to get rid of hives after suffering for so long. I Have not taken dexilant since until last week when I had acid reflux so bad I couldn't suffer any longer si i took one pill on tuesday and on wednesday I had hives so bad all over again. Now I know after all this time that it was the dexilant that caused the hives. I still have them and it has been one week_ one pill was all it took!

I had an upper endoscopic procedure that showed spasms in my lower esophagus. They expanded my lower esophagus and I can take a good deep breath now!  My insurance comp. wanted me to try a lower priced med named Pantoprazole but looking at this site about that medicine_ I'm petrified to try it...I'm hoping that in a few months I can wean off of Dexilent. But it is an excellent medicine!,F,42,40  days60 1X D,7/30/2012Email,Dexilant
67, 1, Gastritis from H. Pylori,Dexilant was having tremors_ muscle spasms_ tingling in leg_ major anxiety and depression.,It works_ but has way too many side effects. I've tried all PPI's and don't know what to do to cure the gastritis.,M,28,3  weeks60MG 1X D,4/17/2012Email,Dexilant
68, 1, Acid reflux_ breathing issues,Horrible hip joint pain; couldn't lift leg,Techincally_ this was for Dexilant (same drug).  Other family members had complained of leg pain with PPIs_ but I dismissed it--until I found out first hand.,M,51,8  days30 mg 1X D,4/11/2012Email,Dexilant
69, 5, Hiatal hernia_ acid reflux,,Kapidex_ now known as Dexilant_ is the BEST medicine I have ever taken for my hiatal hernia and acid reflux. My gastroenterologist put me on every medicine and finally decided to try this new one. It's amazing_ and keeps all my symptoms away (which were so severe that I lost 10 lbs and couldn't function). I was so happy to have found this pill. My insurance company put up quite a fight and did not want to pay for it and made me try all other pills--which failed. Finally got approved for it. I have not had any side effects. It has only helped and cured my symptoms--not created others.,F,22,2  years60 MG 2X D,1/14/2012Email,Dexilant
70, 2, esophagitis from GERD,itching_ tingling_ feeling like something is crawling on me_ pins & needles sensation when I get hot and/or exercise,This is the same med as Dexilant (dexlansoprazole).  After taking Dexilant successfully for months_ it has suddenly caused me to have itching_ crawling feelings_ tingling_ and when I get hot or exercise I have a stinging like pins and needles on chest_ abdomen and back.  I have been trying to stop this reaction with benedryl but that's not working.,M,60,8  months60 1X D,1/10/2012,Dexilant
71, 3, GERD_ esophagitis,Sore throat_ dizziness_ nausea_ severe intense itching in ear_ sinus pressure and pain.,I couldn't tolerate Nexiums side effects unless I wanted to wear Depends_ and while Dexilant gives me some relief from the constant diarrhea_ the sore throat and ear itch are just as bothersome and painful.,F,45,2  months30 1X D,12/31/2011Email,Dexilant
72, 4, GERD/Esophagitus,none,Taking as alternative to Reglan which caused depression and anxiety. Kapidex (now known as Dexilant) has worked well. I have few symptoms of GERD_ only when I overeat or eat stuff I shouldn't_ and I believe my esophagus is actually healing. Works far better than Nexium or anything else I've tried.,M,61,2  years60 MG 1X D,9/6/2011Email,Dexilant
73, 4, Gastritis,When exposed to the sun_ horrible rash on face and arms. Two courses of steroids and multiple Benadryl later_ finally stopped.,I am on many meds and allergic to many additives in shampoos and lotions so this took a lot of effort to figure out. Haven't been able to find any info on this reaction_ so I am perplexed. On another note_ the drug really helped my gastritis. Going off of it was difficult. Trying Nexium now.,F,41,7  weeks60 my 1X D,7/2/2011Email,Dexilant
74, 2, GERD,The first month and a week it was terrific.  Then_ WHAMMO!  Unbelievable diarrhea.  I am talking about biblical diarrhea...the pharoah was given this by Moses.  I went 4 weeks with diarrhea_ lost 15 pounds_ ate like a horse only to sprint to the bathroom about every hour and a half.  After I stopped taking it for about two days_ my stool began to get a little back to normal but then I got a sore throat that has since moved into my lungs.  I have NEVER missed a day of work in my 20 year professional career until taking this (Dexilant),After I stopped taking it_ bowels were back to normal in a week BUT_ the upper respitory infection I have now is spectacular...again_ I never get sick.,M,45,2.5  months60 1X D,5/24/2011Email,Dexilant
75, 4, Severe Acid Reflux,The first month and a half was great. Acid Reflux took about 3-4 weeks to get under control. Then about 4 weeks ago; I realized that even with sleep meds_ I had an awful problem sleeping_ tossing and turning for atleast an hour each and almost every night for the past month. I take this med at night with my sleep meds. I think it finally caught up with me. I no longer sleep blissfully and peacefully. I will try and take this kapidex (dexilant) in the morning instead of at night and see if I can sleep any better.,It has helped my severe acid reflux......I'd say it's like 80% better and it's worth a try. If you can't sleep after taking it_ however; consult your physician. I am having a chat with mine this week to see if another anti-reflux medication can be taken in it's place and not cause such horrible side affects as not being able to fall asleep in a few mins.....and also walking up sometimes in the middle of the night and it's hard to get back to sleep.,F,50,10  weeks60 MG 1X D,5/23/2011,Dexilant
76, 5, Gerd/ Acid-reflux,Very mild SE's  Some dizzyness_ occassional head pain_ loose stools and cramping or constipation both mild. A little insomnia.,This is a great medicine with minimal side effects_ thus far after a year. They are more annoying than anything. This keeps away the burn for several days after a dose and knocks out acute attacks well. I still take an occasional Tums_ but I have been on all OTC medicines and Aciphex_ and this is the best and most effective. Take this in the morning with food for best results and to avoid sleeplessness.,M,34,1  years60mg 1X AN,4/23/2011,Dexilant

78, 2, GERD,nausea_ chest pain_very bad constipation after taking it for 6 mos; the depression is also very bad.,The side effects were minimal for the first 6 mos or so_ then they got very bad. The constipation is the worst as is the nausea. It's to the point now where I need to stop taking it. The drug is OK_ but not worth the side effects when you cannot eat because of the nausea. The constiptation is also awful. The worst side effects is the depression. I recommend finding a new drug as this one is simply not worth it. At first there were no side effects_ but they slowly got very bad. Trust me and avoid this drug and find one you can stay with in the long run. I'm going back to something like Nexium if that will work.,M,45,1.5  years 1X D,12/9/2010,Dexilant
79, 5, Anastomotic Ulcer,ZERO,KAPIDEX (Now known as Dexilant) has been a wonder drug for me.  Nothing worked for me.  I had horrible GERD_ especially during the night_ where I would wake during the night with a mouth full of acid_ horrible stomach pain_ nausea_ vomiting_ etc.  I had lost approximately 30 pounds due to this ulcer.  The Dexilant is now working and I am doing much better!  I had tried every other medication on the market for Ulcers and GERD and none of them worked!  Thank Goodness this medication is on the market!!!,F,44,3  months120mg 1X D,12/3/2010,Dexilant
80, 5, GERD_ chest pains_ heartburn,Slight loose stools and slight dry mouth,Side effects are very mild_ but well worth taking because it's helped improve my GERD symptoms immensely! I've heard many other people say this too.I'm going to switch to 30mg and see if it will eradicate the side effects which are mild anyway. I also have tried Prilosec and Prevacid OTC and had strong_ unpleasant side effects. I highly recommend Dexilant (formerly Kapidex)_ though it is expensive_ it is a quality drug.I'm guessing that not many people have posted on here because of the lack of side effects!!! Makes sense right? ;),M,24,6  weeks60mg 1X D,10/29/2010Email,Dexilant
