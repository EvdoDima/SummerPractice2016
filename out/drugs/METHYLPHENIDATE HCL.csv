0, 3, Major Depressive Disorder,Loss of appetite_ increased heart rate.  The Come down from this medication is terrible including feelings of depression_ anxiousness_ insomnia.,One 5mg dose lasted for 2 hours then my depressive symptoms returned.  One feels temporary relief followed by a severe crash that returns the mood to an even darker place then before.,M,27,30  days5 mg 3X D,2/8/2014,Methylphenidate hcl
1, 5, Attention Deficit Disorder,"Fixed everything. For one in my life I thought to myself_ ""Hmmm_ is this what it's like to be 'normal?'"" I was happy---chipper even---and (nervously) appetite-less (loved that I could eat anything and still lose mass). I focused. I understood what I was reading! My crippling memory loss that I've had since childhood was gone. I reminded people things! I remembered foreign language phrases I overheard on my TV shows_ and song lyrics I didn't know I ever knew. I cried every single day because I was so happy. The nausea was pretty bad. That never went away.",After 3 and a half weeks it stopped working. I know this for certain because I upped my dosage_ and my brain slowly turned back into swiss cheese. The black outs returned_ as did the dyslexia_ the confusion_ word salad_ severe long-term dissociation (depersonalization)_ mental comprehension (understanding of cause-and-effect) died out_ and my ability focus and write wonderfully_ and verbal articulation was long gone... I cried even harder because I had finally felt normal or real or just had happiness---I felt like Dr. Manhattan---and lost it so very quickly.,F,22,1.5  months20 2X D,1/11/2013Email,Methylphenidate hcl
2, 5, ADD / HEADACHES,Difficult to fall asleep for first couple of weeks then none.,Originally started taking this med for Adult ADD_ then realized I had no headaches at all after having suffered with daily cluster headaches for more than 15 years. Now I try to stay on the drug to keep the headaches at bay and if I've been off for a while (monetary reasons - no insurance) I take 20 mg a day for 3-5 weeks than take once a day 3-4 times a week to stretch my scrip. Miracle Drug - NO OTHER SIDE EFFECTS!,F,53, 20 MG 1X D,6/13/2012Email,Methylphenidate hcl
3, 5, Adult A.D.D.,No unpleasant side effects.  Pleasant ones include bursts of organization_ intense ability to focus on tasks (to exclusion of all else) and talking more than usual.,My A.D.D. came out of hiding when I managed to quit smoking.  Nicotine appeared to be a pretty good brain medicator_ and when it was gone_ I had very poor brain function and lost several jobs because of it.  After being put on generic Ritalin as a regular medication in my 40s_ I was able to actually go to college (while working full time) and eventually_ after 10 years of steady mostly part-time attendance_ I completed my B.A. and held down a responsible job until I retired at age 62.,F,64,15  years,12/7/2008Email,Methylphenidate hcl
4, 5, Adult ADD,First month - loss of appetite_ increased or noticeable heart beat_ slightly blurred vision_ physical shakiness_ euphoria_ energy_ mental clarity and calmness_ deep sleep.After first month - return to normal_ occasional noticeable heart beat_ some appetite loss.,Very helpful_ greatly improved the quality of my life. You don't have to take it on a regular basis_ once you find the dosage schedule that suits you it is possible to use drug on a more casual basis as needed_ for example_ skipping weekends when you don't need to get any serious work done. It is important to track your reactions to the drug and discover a way to use it that works best for you. Just taking it at the same time every day at the same dosage may not be the best way to gain benefit. This is why it can be difficult for children since they aren't able to communicate or understand their needs as an adult can.,M,38,6  months,4/3/2008,Methylphenidate hcl
5, 3, Attention Deficit Disorder,"Euphoria then severe anxiety and depression after ""coming down_"" nervousness and anxiety_ increased social anxiety_ moodiness_ irritability_ paranoia at times_ tremors_ cold extremities_ etc.","At age 14_ I took it (Ritalin) daily for most of ninth grade-- 10mg three times a day. I became a nervous_ paranoid freak. It may be helpful for some people to take every day_ but for the most part I think daily use of this drug is ridiculously unneccesary. It turns you into a speed freak. The fact that they push this and other stimulants on children makes me sick. It infuriates me.   Since my trial with it in 9th grade_ I've taken psychostimulants like this off and on whenever I could get a prescription. I find it extremely helpful to take ""as needed""-- like once a week_ more or less-- rather than on a daily basis. However_ for some reason many psychiatrists are against this idea and would rather have people use it like drug addicts and take high doses every day. I don't know why. Finally_ whether it is Ritalin_ Concerta_ Metadate_ or a generic version_ they're all methylphenidate and work quite similarly. Adderall and other amphetamine drugs are also very similar to methylphenidate drugs. There are lots of ""sustained release""-type formulations of these substances_ but I am actually less fond of them because the timing of their effects are more unpredictable and less controllable.",M,22,6  months,1/7/2003Email,Methylphenidate hcl
