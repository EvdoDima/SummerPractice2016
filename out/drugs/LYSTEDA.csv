0, 1, Heavy Periods & Clotting,Headache & body ache,Not a good choice for me! I took 1 pill the first day of my period within 30 minutes of taking the 1 pill I began to have side effects.... Headache and my body started aching really bad... So done with this medication. Blessings to all the women that has had luck taking it!!!,F,45,1  days,7/10/2016,Lysteda
1, 5, Heavy periods,Headache,I had always taken a lesser dose than what was prescribed. Usually 1 pill the first day and 1 pill the second day. It worked great for me that way. It Slowed my periods to a level I felt was tolerable. Recently I increased the dose hoping to end my period sooner. This caused headache.,F,49,1  days,6/7/2015,Lysteda
2, 2, Heavy Periods,I have always suffered with heavy periods. Most nights I have to wear a diaper to bed because of the gushing. I have tried three cycles worth and have not noticed a difference in my flow. Very disappointed. Next step would be a hysterectomy :(.,,F,39,3  months30mg,11/13/2014,Lysteda
3, 5, Heavy menstrual bleeding,None,Very active and so was so happy to be able to enjoy my ski trip without having to use the bathroom every hour.  Much better option than surgery for uterine fibroids/polyps,F,52,5  days650 mg 6X D,2/23/2014Email,Lysteda

This medicine has definitely not worked for me.:(,,F,29,5  days2 tid,9/13/2013Email,Lysteda

8, 5, Heavy period_ painful periods,,Noticed a difference by the time I took my second dose! Periods are much more manageable and not debilitating any more. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from unmanageable periods. I have also noticed since I have been taking it the past several months that even if I do not take it every period that my period is still lighter! For me this was a godsend!,F,26, 650mg 1X AN,2/23/2013Email,Lysteda
9, 4, Dysmenorrhea and heavy periods,None that outweighed my dysmenorrhea.,"For 5 years since the birth of my youngest_ I have experienced the most excruciating pain with my cycle. I have never experienced painful periods before her birth. I also have what my OB suspects as ""retrograde blood flow"" -- which means the periods were so heavy the blood would flow back up thru the fallopians and into my abdomen.  Also_ since  I got pregnant with my youngest daughter while on BC_ I have had reactions to all BC since.  I refused an IUD and opted to ""suffer"" monthly.  My OB gave me a sample of Lysteda and it has helped.  I still have bad cramping_ but the flow is much less_ more tolerable and I don't feel like Carrie on prom night.",F,36,5  months2 tabs 3X D,1/24/2013Email,Lysteda
10, 4, Uterine fibroids and heavy periods,No side effects ,For me_ Lysteda is better than taking birth control to lessen/stop the bleeding.  The first time I had to take it the bleeding lessened within hours (I had been changing sanitary products every other hour a day and doubling protection at night)_ and within 3 days it stopped.  On the last occurrence although I had lighter bleeding_ it took the entire 5 day dose before the flow lessened considerably.,F,52,5  days1300 3X D,11/2/2012,Lysteda
11, 3, Heavy Cycle,Prolonged cycles. While on pills will dramatically decrease flow and produced a lot of clotting_ (not for sure is the drug is suppose to produce clotting). Once I stop taking because I only took on my heavy days my cycle will start again with periodic spotting days later. I will discontinue use at this time to see if its the pills or something else,I have recommended this product to others and they as well have discontinued use for various reasons.,F,36,4  months650mg 3X D,10/31/2012,Lysteda
12, 4, Heavy period/sharp pains in vagina,Back pain and extreme leg pain to the point where I stopped taking it. I go in on Monday_ 10/8 to my Dr.,I only used it for 2 months and I saw a MAJOR change in my cycles. The leg pain will not go away and I recalled that its one of the side effects_ so I stopped taking the meds. I love having light_ managebale periods_ but my leg and back pain outweighs it and I just want the pain to stop.,F,39,4  days 6X D,10/3/2012Email,Lysteda
13, 1, to control heavy cycles,The first month I didn't recognize any side effects.  I thought this was a miracle drug. I did notice that I started suffering from chronic fatigue.  I thought it was because I had been out of the country and picked up a bug.  The next month I suffered blurred vision and an ocular migraine_ still I didn't make the connection to the medication.  I did realize that the dose I took the first month was too much so the second month I cut it in 1/2.  It still worked great for my period so I didn't even think about the fact that my back hurt a little and I had a stuffy nose_ and I had blurry vision.  I thought dry eyes_ left over illness from being out of the country.  Then the third month came around and I took the medicine and had the strongest reaction.  (In the mean time I had been to the dr and they diagnosed me with anemia_ another side effect I was unaware of) The third time on the medicine I had a very bad headache_ shortness of breath_ chestpain_ blurred vision_ extreme fatigue_ sinu,,F,41,3  months65 3X D,9/20/2012Email,Lysteda
14, 5, Heavy menstrual bleeding,No side effects. This slowed my horrible bleeding to barely spotting. I cannot take hormones or bc pills so this med has been a wonderful solution. I like that you oonly need to take it for five days or less instead of daily.,,F,35,2  months3x a day,7/4/2012,Lysteda
15, 1, Bleeding due to uterine fibroids,Side effects from my first and only dose were extreme: hypertension_ headache_ nausea_ vertigo_ sleep disturbances_ abdomen felt like supernovas were exploding in it. And my fibroid bleeding increased!,Caveat emptor with Lysteda. My gynecologist wanted me to take this drug three times a day for at least three days. After enduring those frightening side effects from just one dose_ I told her NO WAY. Obviously this was not the drug for me. My body reacted as if it were a poison. Fortunately_ by 24 hours after that single dose_ my blood pressure had dropped back to normal_ and all the side effects had disappeared.,F,54,1  days650 mg 1X D,5/20/2012,Lysteda
16, 5, Very Heavy Periods & Bad Cramps,Headache & Stuffy Nose but it is worth it.,This is fantastic. I used to have horrible extremely heavy and painful periods that lasted for about 7 days. Now my periods are very light (like spotting almost) and completely pain free and only last for 3 days. I would highly recommend this.,F,19,7  months 3X D,5/19/2012,Lysteda
17, 5, extremely heavy periods due to fibr,none,I normally have crazy periods and lose so much blood it makes me anemic.  my Dr. prescribed Lysteda.   Started my period yesterday and after 1 dose my period changed to spotting.  After 2 doses it stopped completely.,F,57,1  days2 pills 3X D,3/27/2012,Lysteda
18, 2, Heavy Period,Room-spinning dizziness and headache.  Some anxiety but that might be just a reaction to the dizziness.,The first go round_ my period stopped after the 1st dose.  Unfortunately_ the last three rounds I have taken it_ have not lessened the bleeding one iota.  ,F,47,4  months1300 mg 3X D,10/18/2011Email,Lysteda
19, 5, Heavy Heavy periods,I absolutley cannot describe the relief that I received within hours of taking this drug.  I thought that taking it 3 times a day was going to be hard but I will tell you that after the first dose and within hours I noticed a difference I didnt want the flow to start back up.  I stopped my period within 3 days and swear by this drug.  I used to plan my family outings by my periods...now I take my Lysteda.  LOVE THIS DRUG,,F,31,5  days650 3X D,9/29/2011Email,Lysteda
20, 5, Debilitating periods,slight achiness_ barely noticeable,"Before this drug_ I was bleeding so heavily I slept with super plus tampon AND maxi pad_ and still had to wake during the night to change every 3 hours. I was in so much pain I was crawling on the floor for one day each month and missing all activities for days. Lysteda has really helped! At 47_ I had an ovary removed due to cyst_ but periods continued worsening. My Dr. kept telling my to ""just get a hysterectomy"" but I refused. Lysteda was a last ditch effort and so far_ so good. Since I'm sensitive_ I started out with 2x/day_ but feel that 3x a day will be manageable next month.",F,48,1  months2 pills 2X D,8/19/2011Email,Lysteda
21, 5, Lessen monthly bleeding,Changed my life completely. I went from bleeding through double protection and my clothes for days on end to a normal_ light period. I was amazed at how well it works.,,F,37,1  months 3X D,5/16/2011Email,Lysteda
22, 5, Heavy Mentrual Bleeding,There were no side effects at all,This drug is amazing.  It helped my heavy bleeding considerably with no side effects. And while the recommended dose is 1300mg 3x a day for 5 days_ i find that 650mg 3x a day for 5 days works just as well_ so if you start this drug_ ask your doctor if you can start at a lower dose.,F,43,6  months650 mg 3X D,1/13/2011,Lysteda
23, 4, heavy menstrual bleeding,,start taking the first dose as soon as you start your cycle,F,39, 650x2 3X D,11/18/2010,Lysteda
