1, 5, Crohn's Disease (diarrhea),None,Can't take any other medications an hour before or a couple of hours afterward. I've been on many different drugs for Crohn's Disease (Asacol_ Dipentum_ Pentasa and now Lialda)_ but it wasn't until I started the Questran that my diarrhea abated significantly. If I go a day without it_ I have diarrhea all day long; but otherwise if I take it_ I rarely do. It's been a true lifesaver for me! A bonus is that my cholesterol is also very low!,F,51,12  years,9/17/2009,Questran light

4, 5, Diarrhea and high cholesterol,None.,"I had my gall bladder removed at age 13 due to an accident_ which ultimately caused severe diarrhea.  Using questran light_ which has a side effect of constipation for some_ caused me to have normal bowel movements.  I'm now ""normal"" and love it!  It also controls my cholesterol levels.

6, 5, distal ileum_ ileocecal valve remov,must take care not to take it within at least two hours of other medications_ because it absorbs them along with the bile.
