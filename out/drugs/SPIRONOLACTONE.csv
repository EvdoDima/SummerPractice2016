1, 4, Cystic acne,This medicine makes me feel a little tired_ I have had some spotting too.  I lost 5 pounds so far. Frequent urination.,Working better than anything else I have taken. Have struggled with acne for years and it calms down the huge embarrassing boils. Hopefully it will stay clear. Took about 4 weeks to see a difference.,F,45,1  months,7/22/2016,Spironolactone

4, 1, hair loss,after 1 month I started having weak fatigued arms and hands_ then the muscle cramps started then severe anxiety. I finally stopped taking it after 2 more weeks when I started having rapid heart beat. It just wasn't worth it. Now just waiting to feel completely normal again!,,F,46,2  months100 1X D,5/19/2016Email,Spironolactone
5, 3, Acne,It really did help my skin-almost immediately it was less oily and cystic bumps flattened. I also lost 5 lbs_ my stomach became flat and my sex drive increased (weird-everyone else had opposite effect). But the bad side effects far outweighed the good: anxiety_ increased urination_ increased heart rate_ and worst of all one of my breasts became bigger. Stopped taking it_ everything is back to normal except for the breast-still waiting for that to go away and it's been 2 weeks. Afraid this might be permanent. Please be careful_ only try this for acne if it's really bad and nothing else worked.,,F,36,2  weeks50mg,4/4/2016Email,Spironolactone

8, 1, Hair thinning,Weight gain_ fat around the middle_ increased hair loss,Took to help with hair loss even though my testosterone was already super low.  My Derm said I needed to take it to stop more hair loss.  I gained 7 pounds in 4 months while working out and eating as I normally did.  I have been off for 2 months still trying to lose the weight but feel better off of it.  My hair did not improve at all_ in fact it looked worse.  Not sure if that was a result of medicine or if it simply did not work for me and would have lost more anyway.,F,44,4  months50mg 1X D,11/2/2015,Spironolactone
9, 3, Cystic acne,Didn't see results until after taking it for about 3 months. Skin cleared up dramatically_ and less cystic acne. Hair looked healthier and shinier_ nails looked better. Seemed to be working well for the first 2 years_ but in the last year and a half I've noticed a lot more side effects. This includes fatigue_ insomnia_ weight gain_ dizziness_ loss of memory_ frequent urination- even in the middle of the night_ anxiety_ shortness of breath_ tightness in the chest_ and depression. I'm considering weaning off of this medication but have concerns about the acne coming back. However_ the side effects are getting worse that it outweighs the benefits of taking this drug.,If the side effects continue or become worse_ I am worried about the permanent damage it will have on my body long term. I still have occasional cystic acne when I am on it_ just not as bad as it was before.,F,42,3.5  years150mg 1X D,10/31/2015,Spironolactone
10, 1, PCOS_ excess hair growth,I started taking this drug to treat PCOS and excess hair_ however was told that I wouldn't see any dramatic changes for at least a year. This drug ruined me! To list the side affects_ weight gain_  thinning scalp hair_ dizziness_  fatigue_ memory loss_ bloating_ frequent urination_ weakness in extremities_ insomnia_ muscle aches_ and the worst one is the eyelid swelling.  My left eyelid swells up to the point that it looks as though I've been punched in the face. I get daily headaches and feel like the left side of my face and head are being weighed down. I stopped taking Spiro two weeks ago and some of the symptoms have subsided_ but I still can't function properly. Do your research before hand and have a full blood panel done before you even consider taking this drug. I wish I'd never taken it_ I'm so depressed.,,F,34,1  years200,9/11/2015Email,Spironolactone
11, 3, acne,my hormonal acne cleared up (cheeks/jaw) but acne on forehead got worse due to anxiety/stress/depression-- which i think was because of the spiro--it made me very moody. Ruined my period cycle-- i was bleeding for almost 3 months straight and then having only spotting everyweek also hair on head got much thinner-- personally dont think side affects are worth it but its different for everyone i guessits worth a try and really did clear up my hormonal acne_ but i stopped taking it yesterday and am going to try some new methods that keep my period cycle normal because that really affects your emotional state-- maybe birth control_ vitex_ or just vitamins from now ongotta remember not to give up or let acne/other cosmetic issues dictate your life--outlook on life is everything and i realized the less i focus on trying to cure the acne the more i enjoy my life doing the things i like and then acne gets better with this positivity anyway-- its like what they say about chasing happiness!,,F,19,1  months100,9/9/2015,Spironolactone
12, 1, PCOS_ Hair loss_ unwanted hair grow,Thirst_ dizziness_ dry skin_ droopy eye lids_ fine lines_ irritability.,In one month hair growth slowed down_ don't really need to shave at all. I thought this drug was a miracle. But after 2 months my skin looks older_ there are fine lines everywhere. The WORST part is within only TWO MONTHS my eyelids droop SIGNIFICANTLY. My 55 year old mother has younger looking eyes than me now and I must stress_ this happened within 2 months. My face looking younger for my age was my one saving grace_ despite being hairy  at least I had that. Aldactone took that away from me. I am so depressed.,F,35,60  days50mg 2X D,8/10/2015Email,Spironolactone

15, 5, Antiandrogen- hirsutism & acne,Initially had some breast tenderness and period-like bleeding.Some nausea.,I have PCOS and gained 40 pounds that I have never been able to take off without starving myself. With spiro_ I have lost 35 pounds over the past year without much effort. Acne and hirsutism have reduced some_ but not as much as I would like. The weight loss factor has been a pleasant side effect that makes up for it.I have also begun having more menstrual periods (I used to have 1-2 really bad ones a year_ then stopped because I had endometrial ablation.) Now_ the periods aren't near as bad as they once were and I have noticed fewer ovarian cysts. I had to work my dosage up from 50 MG a day to 125 per day. I also have to get blood work done every 3-4 months to monitor my blood potassium levels and avoid eating foods or vitamins with added potassium.I have tried just about every hormonal therapy available_ which cause mood swings and other more adverse effects. Spironolactone is a miracle drug for me. No complaints with this medication at all.,F,38,1.3  years125 MG 1X D,4/7/2015Email,Spironolactone
16, 2, PCOS hair loss,Since taking it for 2 years at 200mg a day_ I only have lower blood pressure.  Nothing else.,This med hasn't worked as well as I wished.  My head hair shedding increased to the original amount I started with.  I am currently on a Thyroid medication for low Thyroid_ and supplement with Evening Primrose_ Arginin_ and Protein shakes.  That seems to be helping much better.  But still on 200 mg of Aladactone a day too.,F,37,2  years200 1X D,4/3/2015EmailHistory,Spironolactone
17, 3, Bloating_ swelling in feet,Nausea_ dizziness_ feel like passing out_ headache_ periods of frequent urination annoying when happens throughout the night_ flushed face & chills,My feet and bloating have gotten better but at a price. These side effects I have caused me to not be able to hardly function after I take my medication. Still have some of these issues but not as severly when I get up in the morning until I have to take the medication. Not sure how much longer I can take this without trying a different kind. Which I hate these side effects because it is helping. I've read that sometimes side effects get a little better over time taking this but I don't know how long that's supposed to be and again how much more I can take.,F,52,1  months100 mg-50,4/2/2015Email,Spironolactone
18, 4, PCOS_ hirsutism,Occasional dizziness and lightheadedness due to lowering of blood pressure.  Cannot miss a dose or lower my dose because of edema reaction.,I have been taking this drug for PCOS and excessive facial hair (chin) since 1994.  I initially started out with 150mg a day_ eventually to 200mg and finally at 250mg per day for about the last 10 years.  After starting this medication and making diet and lifestyle changes I slowly lost 60 pounds.  I have kept that weight off ever since.  My periods continue to be irregular - sometimes they are frequent and then I won't have one for many months_ so it didn't help much in that department.  But I no longer get any menstrual cramps_ heavy bleeding or PMS so that's a bonus.  Periods are typically light and forgettable.    The dark thick hairs that sprout on my chin reduced by about 75% on this medication and have stayed at that level.  I still pluck a few hairs every day but it's manageable.  Prior to starting this medication I would occasionally find random dark hairs in weird places like on my chest or shoulder.  That stopped once I started taking this medication.A few times my doctor has suggested that I wean off of it_ but every time I try to lower the dosage (even 25mg) I get severe edema in my feet and ankles.  I can't imagine how long it would take to slowly ween off it or how my body would react.  I continue to take spironolactone basically out of fear.  I don't want to regain weight_ return to horrible painful periods_ or live with the excessive facial hair.  ,F,45,21  years250 mg 1X D,3/1/2015,Spironolactone

21, 5, PCOS,Not only has my acne completely cleared_ but my skin is also very soft and full looking. I used to have very dark_ fast growing hair all over my body_ but now it is much lighter and slow growing. I lost about 12 lbs (144 lbs to 132 lbs) and don't gain weight as easily in the past. My figure is much more feminine too_ but I am still able to put on the muscle I need to workout. However_ I easily get extremely dehydrated which is frustrating for someone who is very active and fit.,When I initially took this medication_ I felt very dizzy and tired all the time_ but that only lasted about 5 weeks. I also dealt with severe mood swings for 3 months_ but that also went away.This is one of those medications that you have to be patient with. I didn't see the full benefits until 5 months in_ but I look and feel better than ever now.,F,21,7  months50 MG 2X D,1/25/2015,Spironolactone

26, 4, Pcos acne,Weight gain (15lbs on a lifelong skinny frame) that cannot be lost on hips and thighs_I can starve myself for days and the weight wont come off. I was always very tiny before. In the beginning breast tenderness and lumpiness but that goes away quickly. Horrible short term memory loss to the point I forget common words (I was always eloquent before and spoke two languages) and where I put things constantly. I'm worse than a dementia patient and I cannot keep information in my mind. I'll have to finish a book in one day or I'll forget what I read the day before.... I lost muscle on my body that I cannot gain back despite rigorous excercise like figure skating and ballet_ so even doing weighted squats I have a sagging butt that was always firm before. Seriously_ you won't be able to gain even tiny muscles tone anywhere. I often feel like I'm going to faint but drinking loads of water and taking metformin has helped that side effect.

29, 2, acne,It worked great for my acne. I can truly say its a magic drug for clearing your acne but i started to feel really tired and fatigued all the time. As if i had no muscle strength. It also made me really depressed and anxious. I got so scared of the anxiety that i experienced that i stopped right away. Its been two months that i do not take it and i am starting to feel normal again. However i did not experience any weight gain at all.,,F,28,3  months25,8/17/2014,Spironolactone
30, 2, Hormonal Acne,This drug is AWFUL. Only 3 weeks in and I have rapidly and uncontrollably gained 15lbs. That is insane! I am fit_ eat well etc. nothing slowed it. I got so dizzy_ sweaty and nauseous a few time I almost passed out crossing the street holding my child. I have anxiety_ panic_ mani_ hot flashes_ night sweats_ insomnia_ nightmares_ tremors_ dehydration_ migraines_ depression_ suicidal thoughts. What a nightmare!!!!! Stopped cold turkey yesterday and I have gained another 5lbs from swelling and retention. From other reviewers who experienced similiar symptoms they noted it took months to YEARS to feel normal again. I'm on the verge of a lawsuit if I don't breakdown first. Please beware of the consequences of putting big pharmacy into your body. I'd rather be acne ridden and sane then fat and suicidal.,,F,34,3  weeks50mg x 2,8/15/2014,Spironolactone

34, 4, PCOS_ absent periods,Frequency urination_ weight loss_ nausea_ dizziness_ reduced hair growth on chin_ legs_ and underarms!,I started taking 25mg twice a day for PCOS. I had high testosterone levels_ abnormal hair growth_ and acne. My doctors continuously did blood work every three months to see how the medication was working. I was increased to 50mg 2x a day then eventually to 100mg 2x a day. I did not notice side effects until 100mg aside from weight loss_ I lost 10 pounds overall without doing anything different. At 100mg my testosterone levels were still very high and we tried a few different birth control pills. Levels were consistent for the next two visits and it was decided to decrease to 75mg. Currently I do not have any cysts so my doctor decided to try taking me off the birth control pill and reducing to 50mg 2x a day. I have magically gained 8 pounds in the last week and am unsure if the two are related. I am thinking since I am still consuming the same amount of water and do not have the higher strength of the pill to act as a diuretic_ it is water weight.,F,26,2  years50 MG 2X D,12/5/2013,Spironolactone
35, 3, Acne,Night sweats if I work out during the day_ body acne (when I had none before)_ and I seem to be gaining weight and I always feel bloated.  Will try to update in a month to see if I really am gaining weight from this pill.  Not looking good.  Oh something else - about the same time that I started this pill (and Aczone)_ I developed Keratosis Pilaris (chronic skin condition) which was pretty devastating.  I know the skin condition is genetic but it is weird it happened at the same time I started this acne medication.,I take this in addition to Aczone (topical treatment). The Aczone seems to prevent the little ones and the Spironolactone helps with the cyst type acne. Spironolactone seemed to work right away. I call it my miracle pill! 22 years of acne finally GONE. But the side effects may be too much for me to handle.,F,36,3  months50 MG 1X D,10/22/2013EmailHistory,Spironolactone

38, 1, Hair growth on face & loss on head,"This caused me extreme grief. I desperately wanted to stay on it to help with my problem. I developed shooting pain behind one of my nipples. Due to its name ""spironalactone""_ I wondered if the ""lact"" portion of the word had anything to do with the breasts. On a hunch_ I stopped the drug. Breast pain checked out fine with a mammogram and subsided so I resumed the meds. About 2 months later the pain came back and I developed the most insanely itching and burning face_ neck and chest very little redness but oh the pain. It feels like stinging nettles...or razor burn. Anyway it started in my cheeks and gradually lowered into my chin_ neck and chest and now my arms too. I've been off of the drug for about 10 days now and the breast pain has once again let up but this itching is driving me mad. I hope it doesn't last much longer. The odd thing is that there's hardly a mark. Slight redness but its horrific. I'm rubbing 2.5% cortisone on it and taking allergy pills but the only thing that helps is Ice. :(",,F,46,8  months25mg,9/30/2013,Spironolactone

Was very careful to increase fluid intake. Woke up from a leg cramp at night and ended up with a scary fainting spell. Stopped taking the medication but have periodic spells of nausea_ almost anxiety_ since stopping. This probably would have been beneficial for my acne_ but I don't like feeling like I could pass out at irregular times.

42, 4, Hormonal Cystic Acne,Irregular menstrual cycle at higher doses (>100 mg).,I was getting cystic acne on my chin and cheeks every month around my menstrual cycle. These cysts were huge and would last for 1-2 months. Spironolactone helped me get my hormonal cystic acne under control but_ after around 8 months_ I started getting cysts on my chin (no more on my cheeks) again. I tried increasing my dose but this really messed my period up. I took a dose of accutane in college that really helped me so I stopped the spiro and am currently giving accutane another shot. I probably would not have gone on accutane if spiro could have kept the cysts suppressed. Overall_ this drug helped me and I would recommend it to other women who struggle with hormonal acne.,F,31,1  years50 mg 2X D,4/13/2013,Spironolactone
43, 4, PCOS_ Acne_ facial hair_ hair loss,Fatigue_ dry mouth_ nausea_ frequent urination,Fantastic. About three years ago I gained about 60 lbs._ got really greasy oily skin_ and my normally thick_ coarse hair had severely thinned out. My hair used to break combs in it's natural state and then suddenly I couldn't allow myself to be seen without a full head weave. I have always been hairy_ but it had gotten completely out of control. I had hair growing everywhere except on my head. My scalp hair was thinning on the sides and top. I was beside myself. I felt monstrous. Then_ drum roll please_ I was diagnosed with PCOS. Ooooooooh. I was put on Metformin and that helped to an extent. I thought that Id never feel pretty again. I was then prescribed spiro last year. The side effects were kind of funky_ but then again_ the PCOS didn't make me feel so hot to begin with. I stuck it out and within months_ my skin cleared up. I actually get compliments on my complexion again. I am no longer oily_ more on  the dry side now. Really small price to pay. The hair on my head is picking up_ while the hair on my body is slowing down. I still have to tweeze and wax facial hair_ but not nearly as often. One side effect that I didn't expect was that my already big boobs got even bigger. The fatigue isn't as bad. I use vitamins_ get regular b12 shots_ and use raspberry ketones to keep my energy up.,F,39,1  years100mg 2X D,4/10/2013Email,Spironolactone

47, 2, Acne,Bloating_ weird changes in skin texture and elasticity--possibly scarring_ mottled pigmentation_ and accelerated aging. Loss of sex drive_ fatigue_ depression. Change in body shape and a seemingly permanent inability to gain it back.,The medicine helped clear up my cystic acne in 3 months and_ initially_ I appeared to drop water weight_ but over the course of a year_ it gradually began to cause perpetual bloating_ weight gain_ and mottled saggy leathery skin! I'm so glad I realized it was Spiro b/c I honestly feel like if I had stayed on it for another year I would look 10 yrs older!  Anyways_ I actually expected to gain weight b/c this stuff increases your estrogen and lowers your testosterone (and therefore your metabolism and muscle mass--which is what helps you burn calories FYI) so I was VERY regimented and strict about my diet and exercise plan but apparently this stuff just changed my hormones so much that it didn't matter. I wasn't even on a high dose_ but any time you increase estrogen you run the risk of turning all fat and soft.  The fact that it lowers your testosterone makes it nearly impossible to keep the weight off--no matter how much you exercise or diet your hips will get bigger_ mark my words!  Wean yourself off slowly if you want to stop it_ cuz this stuff really does a # on your hormones_ and they wont be going back to normal any time soon (so you need to make it easier for your body).,F,28,1  years25MG 2X D,9/4/2012Email,Spironolactone
48, 3, PCOS_ hirsuitism,Kidney stones_ weight gain after going off.,This drug did what it was supposed to do. It slowed my hair growth and made it lighter on my arms_ legs_ and prevented new whiskers from forming on my face. It caused me to lose 5 pounds of water weight while I was on it_ which was nice... Until I got kidney stones_ most likely from the chronic dehydration caused by this drug - it is a diuretic. I ended up in the emergency room in horrible pain and discontinued taking it at that time. I have since gained 10 pounds in 6 weeks. I'm assuming 5 pounds of water weight and 5 pounds of fat. The side effects were not worth the benefits for me_ even though it did what it was supposed to do. I advise staying very hydrated if you are on this drug.,F,25,6  months150mg 2X D,5/24/2012Email,Spironolactone

I have taken Accutane_ which worked fantastically with no side effects_ but had to stop early because I needed to go on medication for my epilepsy. There is apparently no interaction between Spironolactone and Lamotrigine. Since taking it I have had sudden fatigue (sleeping during the day - not normal for me at all); chronic anxiety; depression; dissociation; and seizures. None of these things were problems before (my seizures were controlled)_ and I found the mood disruptions extremely disturbing - especially as they were so noticeable and not at all within my normal range of experience.

53, 2, Acne,dizziness_ dehydration_ headaches_ leg cramping_ fainting_ nausea,The doctor should always check your blood work before you take this drug. My blood work was not checked and I really suffered because of it.Drink lots of water because it is a diuretic and will cause you to lose alot of water. Do not take it if you have low blood pressure. My cystic acne went away_ but I had these strange little bumps around my hair line on my forehead and after I stopped taking it my skin has never been the same. I seemed to have more pigmentation from the acne when I never had that problem before.

55, 3, Hormonal Adult Acne,Ovulation pain_ irregular periods_ severe PMS_ heart palpitations,This medication made my acne completely disappear. I loved it for the 1st year and didn't experience any side effects. For some reason my periods became irregular and I developed PMS and heart palpitations during the 2nd year. I also experience chronic anxiety and think that this medication may have made it worse. I stopped taking it 2 months ago and I haven't experienced any cystic acne_ although my Dr. said it takes about 5 months for the acne to come back. I no longer feel as anxious_ the heart palpitations are gone and the PMS is gone. I have just decided not to mess with my hormones anymore and live with the acne if it comes back.,F,41,2  years50 MG 1X D,6/23/2011,Spironolactone
56, 5, PMS,Period was weird for about the first 3 months.,This medication saved my life!  After my 3rd child was born_ I started having severe PMS that was ruining my life_ destroying all of my relationships_ and making wish I could just jump off the crazy roller coaster.  This medication eliminated PMS for me within 3-4 months.  My periods are usually 3 days_ my moods are stable_ acne completely cleared up_ I was able to lose 40 lbs_ had a great deal more energy.  I felt happy for the first time since my daughter was born 2 years earlier.  I was diagnosed with Post-Partum depression caused by hormonal imbalance_ and this drug fixed that problem.  Almost ALL doctors treat my symptoms with birth control pills_ and won't even consider this drug as an alternative.  My friend who suffered with similar problems for years and years finally had to switch doctors to try this drug.  He refused to give her this drug_ insisting that the only thing that would help her was birth control pills.  She has been on spironolactone now for almost a year and also says that it saved her life!,F,40,2  years100 MG 1X D,5/27/2011Email,Spironolactone

59, 1, Androgenetic Alopecia,I am a 33 year old caucasian woman with a diagnosis of Androgenetic Alopecia. I had been taking Spironolactone for three years and stopped  as of yesterday. I initially took 200mg and then lowered it to 75mg due to melasma.Side effects I have experienced at various times include: brown melasma_ yellow pigmentation_ amenorrhoea_ muscle weakness_ impaired short term memory_ excessive sweating_ heartrate more than double normal resting rate_ facial flushing_ less energy_ weight loss of 8lbs_ mottled skin_ greasy undereye_ change of skin texture on face_ wrinkling_ sagging_ premature aging_ lipodystrophy of facial flesh_ change of texture underneath eyes_ red tint to my undereye bags_ thickening of skin on inner cheeks and undereye_ increased pore size_ loss of 'fresh' youthful look.Three months ago I came off spironolactone as I suspected it was having an adverse effect on my face but I wasn't sure how much of it was due to minoxidil as I know this has an effect on collagen format,Never again. My face is more important than my hair. What is interesting_ or damn right freaky is the following. I decided to observe a patch of melasma in the centre of my forehead which did not have any wrinkles going across it. In the space of 24hrs_ and subsequent to the tight_ contracted feeling_ I developed two wrinkles spanning this entire area. I was looking at the patch at the same time_ and under exactly the same fluorescent lighting conditions. The next night I experienced the same tight contracted feeling and it was strongly located under my right eye. The next morning I had a new 'wrinkle'_ looking more like a line_ running across about a cm under my lowest genuine wrinkle.As a general observation I believe my face has prematurely aged_ it appears to have sagged_ and the flesh which was defining my high cheek bones appears to have moved downwards. The shape of my face has changed. I now believe this is all due to spironolactone and its antiandrogen effect. Tonight_ one night after taking my last small dose of 25mg my face feels slightly tight but is not contracting. I also must point out that the antiandrogen effect kicked in on my hair very rapidly_ as tonight I lost approximately half the number of hairs I had been losing whilst off spiro.,F,33,3  years200mg_75mg 1X D,9/1/2010Email,Spironolactone

Only two effective treatments exist_ removal of an adrenal gland or blocking aldosterone in the body by taking spironolactone.  The downside is that spironolactone also blocks testosterone_ which is why this drug is often used by transsexuals.  If you are male and take 100mg per day_ your chance of breast enlargement is 50 percent!  If you take more than 100mg you may some day need a bra. :o,M,54,2  years,7/19/2009,Spironolactone

65, 5, Acne,Lightheaded_ constant urination_ pass-out feeling due to lower blood pressure,I went to an endocrinologist to treat my acne (cystic) because I knew my acne was hormonal. I took 100mg twice a day_ which is high compared to other patients taking this drug. I used to get at least one different pimple a day; once I started this drug I did not get a single pimple. I took it for about a year_ when I decided to discontinue it. After a couple of months I resumed the drug and the side effects were much stronger than when I had first taken it. I felt very lethargic and very very lightheaded; in one occasion_ I almost passed out. However_ this would not stop me from taking the drug again. This drug is excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I work in a dermatology office and it's a shame how underrated this medication is. My acne is pretty controlled now; I'm not using any orals_ just topical medications.,M,23,1  years,5/19/2009,Spironolactone

This drug is a miracle for my oily skin and excessive sweating.  I have too much testosterone due to my PCOS and so I am experiencing hair loss_ body hair growth_ and acne.  The Spiro has not helped fix my scalp hair_ but I do notice a slight improvement in body hair.  Skin is overly dry but it's a heck of a lot better than being a grease ball!  The main reason why I am taking it is to try to grow my scalp hair back and to have normal body hair.  I am about to switch to Flutamide to see if it will help in that department.,F,27,3  years,5/13/2009,Spironolactone
67, 5, hair loss,1 week adjustment period where I had insatiable cravings for salt and couldn't drink enough water. Since then: inside of my nose is often very dry_ get headaches more easily_ my fingernails are thinner and tear easily_ and I get leg cramps at night. I have to be more careful than before to drink enough water every day. Still_ great med.  Totally worth it.,I convinced my doctor to prescribe this for me based on what I had read (by endocrinologist_Geoffrey Redmond) about how it can help stop hormone-related hair loss for some women.  Apparently_ it's working. Hair loss has very substantially slowed in the 5 months i've been taking it(though_ no regrowth).  What really surprised me though was the astonishing improvement in my skin.  All my acne - which hasn't really responded to any treatment I've tried during the 30+ years i've battled it - virtually vanished within 2 weeks. My skin used to feel oily and gritty and I was never without pimples; now it's smoother than it's been since I was 10 years old. I'm amazed and thrilled at this unanticipated benefit. I should also mention that I am taking a very low dose of 25mg. I'd read that you should start with a low dose and work up to at least 100 mg to be effective_ but it was already working great at 25mg and when I upped it to 50 mg_ my side effects got worse_ so I'm holding steady at 25 mg.,F,45,5  months,1/2/2009,Spironolactone

Too soon to tell about the hair loss_ but the facial hair is less noticable_ and is growing back in much more slowly. My blood pressure had been creeping up to bordlerline high after a lifetime of low/normal bp_ and after starting this medication my bp is back down where it should be.

After just two days taking this_ I noticed that my breasts were more pronounced.  I have read many places that spiro often causes weight gain_ but after reading the other responses on this site_ I know I was not the only one who experienced weight loss.  I think that since most of us get too much sodium and not enough potassium_ this medicine may have some health benefits for almost everyone_ but it also has risks significant enough that people probably should not take it unless they need it for some other reason.  I take it because it is a highly effective anti-androgen and greatly reduces the unwanted effects of high testosterone levels.  The benefits of spironolactone far outweigh the side effects_ at least for me.  I think this really is a wonder drug for some people.  I was forced to stop taking it for a while and just let me tell you that going off of it was horrible.

Besides having to run to the restroom every 30 min (my coworkers swore I was pregnant)_ it's been great_ and the intake in water has been good daily routine.  Between the pill and Weight Watchers_ I've lost roughly 15 lbs_ and I feel very good.  My hair is starting to grow back and I can visually see results_ even with my fine hair. Although facial hair continues to be an issue_ it's no longer a daily-maintenance thing.

The results for my acne with Spironolactone have been amazing...it's a miracle and has changed my life.  It took a few months for my skin to completely clear.
