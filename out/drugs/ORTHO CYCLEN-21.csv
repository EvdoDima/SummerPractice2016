0, 1, Birth control,The only positive thing that came from Ortho cyclen was I have no acne what so ever. But I have been bleeding evryday since I starting taking this pill. Over 8 months ago!! And I don't mean spotting or break through bleeding I mean 24 7 bleeding for over 8 months. In sain nausea I have to run to the bathroom and puke every morning around 7. Horrible cramping and uncontrollable moodswings. I wanna cry and in ball and also kill everyone at the same time. I would have rather gotten pregnant Tha put up with this ridiculious side affects.,Taking this birth control was one of the worst mistakes I've ever done. I would never recommend this. Ever.,F,19,8  months,7/15/2016,Ortho cyclen-21
1, 5, Contraceptive_ Acne,My periods are heavier than they were on my last pill_ not bad though. Sore breasts_ increased appetite_ bloating_ and fatigue - typically way more noticeable around my period.But! I take this every night (when I took in the mornings my emotions were out of control) and I'm very pleased. My acne had a small  adjustment breakout and is now gone! I'm regular (finally!) Except it doesn't fall on my placebo week - I've synced with the lunar cycles... Which is a week earlier. I'll adjust things to match_ however. I hardly notice any moodiness_ I'm much more lively and happy on this pill. I can tell I'm on a birth control; I'm not quite me emotionally. But it isn't bad at all! Definitely found my match!,,F,20,2  months,2/25/2016,Ortho cyclen-21
2, 3, Birth control,Bigger breasts_ nausea_ diarrhea_ loss of appetite_ increased sensitivity to smells (make you feel sick)_ tired,So I'm coming off many years of depo_ and just switched to this pill. My boobs look huge_ nothing looks appealing to eat and I feel no hunger at all...all day. When I do eat_ I rush to the bathroom with diarrhea and then I get extreme nausea. I'm going to stick with it for a while and see what happens.,F,27,2  weeks,6/24/2015Email,Ortho cyclen-21
3, 3, Regulate periods,I became a moody b****! I already have depression_ which I take 2 anti-depressants for. Within 2 weeks of starting Previfem (generic)_ I noticed I was REALLY quick to anger & cry. Just when it seemed to get better_ I'd flip out over nothing & feel so despondent for hours/days. And even if the crying isn't happening_ I'm still always negative & irritable. I have had some sensitive tummy issues_ but I never considered that this could be the cause... After reading reviews_ it likely is.,It *did* regulate my period (I was having it twice a month)_ so it did it's purpose. I just can't handle the mood swings. Starting next week_ I'm switching to Loryna. Hopefully that'll be better!,F,,3  months 1X D,3/16/2015,Ortho cyclen-21
4, 5, birth control,Moodiness for the first month or so and headaches,I loooove this pill!! Yes at first I was moody and I had headaches every week but once I reached the three month mark it all leveled out. Now I honestly feel better on the pill than prior to the pill. My periods are a breeze and my face is clearer than ever! I has crazy pms before the pill where I would be major emotional_ get horrible migraines_ and break out like crazy! Now I feel normal and under control. I never want to go off of it...but I will when I want kids!,F,24,4  months,2/27/2015,Ortho cyclen-21
5, 3, birth control,I have been sick and just started taking this birth control a few days ago..I have been feeling nauseated_ tired_ and awful headaches..thought it was cause I had been sick till I noticed my breast being sore so I done some googling and found out it's this birth control making me feel like this and not because I've been sick! &I've always had bad headaches to begin with&knew the birth control would make them worse as it always has&thought just maybe my headaches were so bad they were making me nauseas..wrong! I've tried every birth control possible and this is by far the worse I've felt with any my spouse has even asked if I'm pregnant from the way I've felt and acted..good luck to whoever uses this!,,F,21,5  days30mg,1/10/2015Email,Ortho cyclen-21
6, 1, birth control,From someone whose coming from the Depo and has been taking the Depo for a whole year.. changing birth controls has probably been the worst decision. These pill suck and made me feel horrible. At first they were great_ my period only lasted for about 3 days BUT the cramping was unbearable ! Not to include the EXTREME nausea .. It really didn't start until the beginning the second month of taking them. I literally thought I was pregnant_ which was the complete opposite of what I wanted. The side affects were not worth it and I immediately quick taking them once I figured out why I was soooooo nauseous. Additionally I started having severe headaches_ and my breast were swollen as well. As I said the only good side affects were the period lasting for three days and the weight loss_ other than that I really did not like these pills at all.,The only major problem I had with these pills were the nausea. I had to continuously drink sprite to settle the nausea and take about 4 breaks at work because_ I was so tired. Be mindful of the side affects because they only affect certain people and other have the good hand but when all said and done pleaseee be mindful. I've seen that I am not the only one dealing with these side affects .,F,19,1  months30 pack 1X D,9/7/2014Email,Ortho cyclen-21
7, 3, Birth control,A lot of nausea the first couple of months so I would normally take it at night before going to bed. It took a while to get used to but eventually it wasn't bad. My skin cleared and my period was light. However_ my insurance changed and I had to get the generic brand Sprintec. I started to get more nauseas in the mornings and I thought I would get use to it again but it's just gotten worse. I finally decided to stop taking it.,,F,25,2  years,9/4/2014,Ortho cyclen-21
8, 1, birth control,This birth control seriously caused me some health problems. I had been on the pill for 2 years with no problems_ suddenly I started to experience vertigo_dizziness_nausea and extreme double vision. I have since then gave my body a break from birth control pills. I know every one has their own experience with pills but my experience was one that makes me want to deter from most pills.i just would not recommend this pill.,,F,25,2  years30 mg,8/24/2014Email,Ortho cyclen-21
9, 1, taking for my hormones,I started taking this prescription about 30 days ago_ I think I've decided today not to take it any more I have five left_my side effects have been increasing all month_extreme breast tenderness_ breast enlargement like when you're on your period_ my skin is tender to the touch all over my body_headaches nausea at night_my doctor said that_ it would help me drop weight but it has not I have not gotten on the scale because I'm extremely bloated have a hard stomach and just feel like crap_ I've gained at least 5 or 6 pounds in 30 days.horrible acne_ I've always had clear skin so I know for a fact that this is from the pill_headaches_which I have never had before_cramps all month long_no sex drive_I'm stopping this pill to  way too many side effect_I was put on this medication because my period only last a day and a half which means I haven't hormone issue_ well I know to all that's probably a good thing so to me too I'm not willing to have all these side effects.,,F,37,1  months,6/3/2014Email,Ortho cyclen-21
10, 5, birth control_ regulate hormones,Before any of this. I am pretty average without these hormones. I'm not emotional_ I'm not crazy_ I don't have depression_ or painful cramps or extremely heavy periods.  Ok so the side effects I experienced: Change of breast size. Sometimes larger. No change in emotions. No nausea or diharrea. No change in pain of cramps.  No change in body hair_ I have thick dark hair and it has stayed the same. I feel like it is affecting my weight. I haven't gained any weight. But it feels like it is hard for me to lose weight. The few times it was late due to not having my pill with me_ I would see side effects like spotting (sometimes for a long period of time) and some cramping. I have had a slightly lighter flow than before using ortho cyclen. The two biggest side effects are my sex drive. I almost don't have one. I went from depo to this pill and thought it would change but ever since being on any birth control my sex drive is gone. And the other side effect is darkening of my upper lip. I have pale skin_ with a yellow undertone and I have a permanent redness on my upper lip (look it up_ it happens with hormones) that appeared a month in after starting ortho cyclen. It is like a skin mustache if that makes sense. My boyfriend says he can't tell but I can. It bothers me but I will be staying on the birth control for a bit longer.,,F,26,2  years,5/30/2014Email,Ortho cyclen-21

13, 2, birth control. pregnancy prevention,I have been on Depo Provera before and I hated it. I thought this time around aftet having my first child that I would try Ortho Cyclen and at first I didnt notice I was on it but after about a month I started feeling the symptoms. And I dont like them at all. I wake up in the middle of the night now aching from head to toe so bad that I have to take medicine to make ot bearable enough to fall back asleep. I get sick to my stomach over everything and I cant bend over or properly wear my seat belt without feeling like Im going to lose my stomach contents. I get more headaches than I usually do. And my periods have stayed the same as usual. Just a few days ago I began getting lower abdominal discomforts and they havent gone away yet. Im normally nice and calm and easy going but since taking this I am out of my mind emotional and upset all the time over nothing. It makes me feel depressed when I know I have no reason to be. I dont like the side effects of this at all. It takes a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend and it makes me feel crazy.,,F,19,3  months,1/14/2014,Ortho cyclen-21

I've never felt so depressed in my life. Extremely moody and I cry over the stupidest things. Very negative and easily annoyed. I've never been like this and I can't control my feelings anymore. I got headaches the 1st month but now they're gone. I'm switching pills because I ran out and the country that I'm studying in right now stopped selling all pills w/ norgestimate.

It hasn't helped with my hair loss and skin is minimally better but it has been way better on other pills. I really want to stop this pill.

25, 5, Acne_ pregnancy prevention,Breasts sore_ larger breasts_ losing fat_ heightened energy_ less anger,I've only been on this birth control for two weeks. I switched from Yasmin because it has a diuretic in it_ and I naturally have low blood pressure so I came very close to passing out and felt terrible all the time if I didn't basically drown myself in water every day I was tired of it_ and at one point I tried ortho TRI-cyclen and it drove me insane_ like I was crying and getting enraged over nothing--totally out of my character. I went back to yazmin for a year. Now I tried ortho cyclen (which is a monophasic pill vs. the tri-cyclens triphasic system)_ and I love it!! My mood has improved_ I'm calmer_ I don't feel like I'm going to pass out every morning_ and it's overall great. I had prety bad nausea for just the first two days_ but it's subsided. My breasts are getting bigger and are pretty sore_ but I don't care. It's kind of funny. I have not yet had my period yet on this but I wanted to share my good experience so far because it is possible that you will have a good one! Reading birth control reviews is very deceiving--it is a totally mixed bag and EVERYONE has different natural hormones so pills are not a one-size-fits-all thing at all. I believe that if you generally responded well to yasmin_ you will probably respond well to ortho cyclen_ but possibly badly to ortho-tricyclen (they are different). I can't say this with certainty_ but I read a similar thing from another girl in a review before I started taking the pill_ and it seems like it's true. Good luck!,F,20,2  weeks 1X D,3/24/2012,Ortho cyclen-21

32, 4, Birth control,Cleared up my acne; breasts got larger; periods are lighter_ but last longer.,I really like this pill. I've been taking the BC pill for years now_ and my doctor switched me over to Ortho-Cyclen when my periods were extremely heavy (but very short_ average three days) on my last pill. I haven't experienced many side effects_ mainly just an increase in my breast size (which is ok with me_ they've always been a little small for my size). I never got a LOT of acne_ but what I did get seems to be gone since taking this pill. PMS isn't bad. Never got cramps_ and still don't. My periods are a lot lighter now_ but they last almost a week. Not a bad pill_ all in all. And it keeps me from getting pregnant_ which is the ultimate goal.,F,26,3  years 1X D,8/13/2011Email,Ortho cyclen-21

This one caused me to to have breakthrough with brown on some days and bright red but watery on others. That has been occurring for 2 weeks now. I got SEVERE pain in my back and lower abdomen after a month of taking this. It hasn't completely stopped to date. I was taking 1 IBU every hour just to keep the pain at bay.

So i went to planned parenthood and the doctor suggested this so im hoping it works with regulating my cycle. I havent had any mood swings or depression or weight gain.

35, 5, birth control_ irregular periods_,breast tenderness/breast growth: B to almost C and still growing :)_ headaches & nausea in the first week_ increased sex drive_ less acne,I love this pill! I take the generic Previfem & have no issues. I hear bad things about Sprintec though. I very much suspect that I had a hormone imbalance that doctors would not acknowledge. After much research and no other options_ I decided to try this pill. I wanted something with more estrogen & less progestin. This seems to be doing to the trick. I have less anxiety & my moods slowly seem to be improving. I'm slowly starting to get more energy. I take another medicine that ruins my sex drive & this pill seems to be counteracting it. I can finally enjoy sex again and don't have much trouble achieving orgasm. I would recommend this pill. It's also started to clear my acne. I haven't noticed weight gain. I may even have lost some weight. I really recommend this pill. I hear good things about Ortho products from friends too.,F,23,1  months 1X D,11/6/2010Email,Ortho cyclen-21

40, 4, Prevent pregnacy,Weight gain_ enlarged breasts_ emotionally sensitive a week prior to my period.,"I really like this pill because my period is shorter and it is predictable. I only get it on the weekdays (Tues - Fri_ making hanging out on the weekend easy. Prior my period used to be 6-7 days a week. The negatives: I already have large breast for my height. After reading people's reviews_ it makes sense that I'm having a harder time fitting into my clothes esp in the chest area. This makes going shopping hard. A week prior to my period_ I get so sensitive that I find myself crying about little things. I used to be a little be sensitve before taking BCP_ but being on this makes me even more. I really don't like the weight gain. I think I've gained 10 lbs in 6 months and I can't take it off no matter how often I work out. I used to work out 3x a week and maintain my weight. Now I work out about 4-5 times a week and 2 days out of those week I work out twice (once at work and another after work) a day and I still can't get my weight down. It makes my self esteem go down because I was a little over weight before the pill_ now I am ""obese"" on pill.I wish there was pill that can is like Ortho_ but without the negatives. I doubt it because all BCP will affect your hormones.",F,32,1  years1 tablet 1X D,9/8/2010,Ortho cyclen-21
41, 1, Get my periods back and stop acne,Weight Gain!!!!,I was put on Mononessa generic for ortho cyclen. I was missing my period for about 5 months. Had really bad rosacea/acne break outs_ moody_ nightsweats etc. Classic perimenopausal symptoms. My doctor put me on this to restart my periods and get my skin under control. Of course my doc swears no BC ever causes weight gain_ and we argued about this for about 20 minutes because I insisted on a pill that would not make me gain weight. Well I got my periods back but OMG. I think about food CONSTANTLY_ and I eat constantly. The crazy thing is_ is even when I feel and know Im full_ I still want food! Not only that_ its done absolutely nothing for my skin. I've only gone from 130 to 138 but I just took my last pill today before the sugar pill and Im stopping. I want to keep fitting in the clothes I have. I also have really bad water retention to top it all off.  F*%K it_ I'd rather have bad skin. I started taking zinc supplements and even though Im just about to start my period I've seen a big improvement in my skin when this would normally be the worst time of the month for me.,F,31,3  days 1X D,9/2/2010,Ortho cyclen-21

43, 4, Suspected Endometriosis,Breasts tenderness_ increase in breast size and sporatic evening nausea (mild to severe in intensity_ but mostly mild-moderate).,I'm on Sprintec (generic version). I started Sprintec on 6/6/10 and am currently skipping my sugar pills to avoid menstruating at my PCPs encouragement. My PCP would like me to only have 4 periods per year. My PCP suspects I have endometriosis by rule out of other disorders (Ive had a pelvic ultrasound and blood panels). Prior to the Sprintec_ I was extremely moody_ tearful_ easily irritated_ started to hormonally eat (increasing my weight)_ endured month long physical pain in my low back and abdomen (requiring occasional narcotic use to minimize pain)_ exhausted all the time and I didnt want to socializewhich are all NOT me. I will have to say_ that so far I am VERY pleased with my BC. My weight seems to slowly be stabilizing (no longer hungry all the time)_ the severe pain is mild if at all present_ my moods have greatly improved and my energy has returned. Im honestly starting to feel like my old self again! I new something was wrong with me. I finally decided to get help because I was no longer the upbeat gal I have always been. If being on Sprintec results in me having to deal with tender breasts and nausea for lifeI will gladly take it hands down over where I was prior to starting Sprintec.,F,34,2  months 1X D,8/12/2010Email,Ortho cyclen-21
44, 1, PMS symptoms,"Vomited the first 3 days_ then I noticed that most foods/drinks I could no longer use due to tasting horrible. I was so exhausted/tired I could just stayed in bed all day and I felt generally ""beside myself."" When at days 9-10 suicide thoughts and severe depression kicked in I stopped the pill. This pill is so strong it kills a horse. DO NOT TAKE IT!!!!","My doctor knew that I was sensitive to medications in general. My PMS symptoms included bad breast pain_ so I asked my doctor if she really thinks that this particular pill would help me and not make me sick since she knew my medical history. She said I would be fine. I understand that you have to get used to some medications and some light side effects are acceptable. But I turned into a monster within 2 weeks.

Going back to the old faithful because they did not make me feel like this and i need to lose this five pounds so i need to hit the gym often and really watch what i eat to get back to normal.

(Search ""symptoms of perimenopause"". There are 35 common symptoms!) A popular menopause author suggests this brand and some of the other ""higher estrogen"" bcps like Modicon and Brevicon for perimenopause symptom control. It has helped my insmonia(used to wide awake at 1:00 in the morning) but that's about it. It doesn't help with my cramps at all.  Makes me anxious/restless during the day(I take it in the morning)and causes extra gas/bloating_sinus headaches_sore breasts and carb cravings. Not sure if I want to try a lower estrogen pill than this or just quit bcp all together.  I tried one with higher progesterone and lower estrogen when I was younger. (Lo-Ovral).  That one took away my cramps but made me pretty depressed.",If a bcp pill can make me feel this awful during perimenopause_ I really dread possibly trying hormone replacement therapy as I go through menopause.

Any doctor who prescribes it should lose their license. After sitting in my doctor's office for a good 30 minutes discussing which birth control would be right for me_ and I repeatedly told her I want a low dose of hormones_ do not want to gain any weight_ and something that would help with PMS/PMDD..... so the ""genius"" decides to prescribe me Ortho-cyclen. Are you kidding me?! I was clueless about birth control types at the time_ so I trusted her judgement and took this for 3 months. Worst decision I have ever made in my life. I went from being 130 to 164 within a month. None of my clothes fit me. I have never suffered from acne_ let alone barely had a pimple my entire life. I now have severe acne breakouts which eventually turn into scars. My face is ruined. I have always been a happy go lucky person and fortunately never suffered from depression or any other emotional illnesses. I am now depressed and sad all the time. I feel worthless and have daily mood swings in which I can't control. I needed something to help with PMS/PMDD (which was always very light anyway) but now it is full blown_ barely know myself type stuff. This pill is out of control and I do not recommend anyone taking_ especially if you are young and active which I am (well_ was - thanks to this lovely pill) It destroys your metabolism because of the high amount of hormones it has.

All my side effects are slight_ so I'm not too much in a hurry to change. I have been thinking alot about changning because of white spots and dry/itchy patches on my face but I think I can deal with them for maybe another month or so. Slight moodswings because it's not severe_ I'm just more sensitive after starting the pills. I'm not complaining about nausea because I feel that it's normal for any pills_ as well as the slight weight gain. My boobs have grown but not too much. I just hope the trouble on my face goes away... I'm glad no acne though.

My periods are all over the place... Sone 3 days some almost 9 or 10_ varying day to day on the heaviness. I didn't realize it til now but right about the time I started taking the pill is when my boyfriend (of almost 3 years) and I started fighting all the time because I for no reason felt I couldn't trust him and got mad about everything! But i'd alway think after a fight why I was even mad and I never even really knew! I thought I was just some crazy psycho! Over the past year each time I get my period the cramps are absolutely horrible and I have breast tenderness and my breasts have even begun to leak! Only during my period to they leak_ it's uncomfortable_ and embarrassing! I am going to stop taking this pill for a few months and see if these side effects all subside_ which I think they will!!

It makes me jittery/anxious a few hours after I take it and then the anxiety happens again in the morning right before it's time to take another one.

No weight gain and perfectly clear skin!,This is a great pill.  I was hesitant to try it because Ortho Tri cyclen made me a crazy person.  Since this is a monophasic pill it doesn't cause the same side effects in me.  I have tried Alesse_ Yasmin_ and Demulen.

I even became afraid to be out in public with my friends for fear of having a mood swing and lash out for no reason and hurting others feelings.I'm going to wait it out another few months to see if the affects lessen if I can endure the process.Boobs are happier n fuller though. :),F,30,1  months 1X D,6/8/2010,Ortho cyclen-21

59, 1, birth control/ regulate period,nausea! moody_ depressed; bloated_ hungry; tired and weak-feeling,This is a STRONG medicine. Birth control seems like no big deal but when I started this pill I realized it is very powerful. I feel like puking every afternoon a few hours after taking the pill; interestingly_ yesterday was especially bad and I had eaten onions_ which someone else said made her more nauseas too. I feel really depressed and rather worthless. No longer interested in my school assignments_ reading for pleasure_ or hanging out with my boyfriend. I don't have any energy for rock climbing_ which I usually have fun with. I just feel like going to bed every afternoon but can't sleep. Anyone thinking about taking this should seriously reconsider_ because it is a powerful drug. Also_ once I read about all these healthy people getting blood clots--!!!

I do get bloated while I am on my period but I think that is normal I hear tons of women say they are bloated while they are pregnant and they aren't even on this birth control.  Also my periods are lighter and shorter than ever.  I know exactly what day my period will come and leave.,I absolutely love Orth-cyclen.  i have never had mood swings_ depression_ weight gain or anything and I have been on this pill since I was 17.  I have never gotten pregnant on it.  When I did chose to have my daughter I quit taking the pill and was pregnant within 2 months.  I didn't have any side effects or any changes when I came off the pill.  After I had my daughter I began taking the pill again and I have had the same results.  I am very satisfied with this birth control.  I take my birth control first thing in the morning.  I leave it sitting by my tooth brush so I don't ever forget to take it.

63, 5, endometriosis,depression before and during periods feeling bloated and fat while menstruating.,I started taking ortho cyclen 8 years ago after discovering that I had endometriosis on my ovaries.  I had surgery to remove the endometriosis and have been taking ortho cyclen to supposedly keep it at bay ever since.  I do not take this pill continuously as it just did not feel right.  I have my period every 28 days.  My endometriosis has not returned_ I can't say if it has been due to this pill or not.  However_ I have very few side effects on ortho cyclen.  I tried other bcps shortly after my surgery and I felt extremely moody on them.  I don't seem to feel that way on ortho cyclen.  I am actually surprised by all the negative reviews.  I will say that I have gained weight but I can't say for sure if it is due to the pill or if it's just something that comes with age.  I am also a bit worried about what it will be like going off of ortho cyclen when I choose to get pregnant and whether or not the difference in the progesterone in this pill will effect pregnancy.  I would like to find some studies on this.,F,29,8  years1 pill day 1X D,3/8/2010,Ortho cyclen-21
64, 4, birth control,breast enlargement/tenderness_ some minor water weight gain,So..I just wanted to put a positive comment on here b/c it seems like all of these are negative. Perhaps people are more inclined to comment on something that didn't work. Ortho cyclen for me has been great. I experienced no change in mood ( I also take daily vitamins_ D3_ and a b complex which keeps your mood swings in check). I've never had problems with acne but I haven't had a single blemish since starting the pill. No headaches_ no nausea ( I take it right before bed). No break through bleeding_ a nice short light period. AND I finally got my boobs back after having lost them when I lost weight a few years back. I'm a very small girl_ don't even weight triple digits so I'm just happy to finally have full As again!!I'm hoping they get even bigger on the next pack but I won't get greedy. They are a bit sore though. Also_ I had slight weight gain_ nothing that showed up on the scale but I noticed growing a bit of a belly. I'd rather have a belly and real boobs over having a six pack and being flat chested though! = ) Overall_ I'd recommend at least giving this pill a try before letting these reviews freak you out_ everyone reacts differently. And watch what you eat. if you feel yourself being hungry when you're usually not_ eat something healthy. You shouldn't be gaining more than a few pounds due to the water weight. anything else is because your appetite changed.,F,26,27  days30 mg 1X D,3/5/2010,Ortho cyclen-21

Immediately after I started taking this pill I became light headed and moody. It also made me crave food like crazy! I would eat so much food and then still be starving. Also_ it's made my relationship with my boyfriend suffer because one minute I'll be fine and another I'll be super moody and angry.

I can no longer take birth control because I have a greater risk of getting clots again. I was 20 at the time_ ran track_ never smoked_ and barely drank alcohol.

I also had to eat if I stayed up late_ because if I went to bed hungry_ I would be more nauseous in the morning. I could deal with that_ but the mood swings were killer. It majorly affected my relationships with people. I was depressed for the first month_ and it was a cycle of feeling bad_ crying_ feeling a bit better_ then going back to bad. I wanted to wait it out two or three months to see if the side effects went away_ but I couldn't handle it and had to stop. It did help a bit with cramps_ but not much with length of my period_ and it was heavier than normal. Only really good thing was that my breasts got bigger.,It made me question my relationship with my boyfriend of 3 years almost every day. It was very hard to stop myself from breaking up with him sometimes because I had to keep reminding myself that it was just the birth control hormones talking. I've only been off of it for a week and a half_ and my mood swings are already a lot better.

However_ if any other pill would cause nausea_ vomiting_ acne or weight gain_ then I will stay far away from it. I only experienced the nausea and vomiting.  It was so severe that I couldn't eat and vomited off and on for 1 full day.  The remainder of days was all nausea and vomiting in the morning. At 36 I sincerely do not think having another child is a concern. Particularly since I am single and don't meet anyone of quality anyway. I would rather deal with irregular periods or my usual severe cramps when I am not on bc! I might not be a good source entirely as only having taken it for 6 days.  6 days of hell though was enough for me.  To think_ I bought a 3 month supply.  I wonder what I can do with the unused packs? I wouldn't inflict the misery I experienced in 6 days on anyone!,F,36,6  days,12/6/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
82, 1, BC,This has been the worst of all the pills ive tried. Nausea_ severe Migrane_ i want to sleep all the time_ I even want to quit my job which i have loved the past 5 years and a month before so im pretty sure its not me. My mood swings are horrible_ mostly changing from a mild smile ( i haven't felt happy since i started my first pack- now im starting the 3rd week-)to a howling dog. Ive been extreamly bitchy with everyone around me without been able to stop it. Im hungry every two hours_ i have experienced dry mouth and muscular pains. My legs normally are week during my periods_ but im ovulating right now and it feels like my period because my legs really hurt. My breast really hurt - just like in my period )only im not)- which is not normal for me. Im already a DD and they look big.,im taking ortho cyclen 28.. but i think is the same...,F,23,2  weeks,11/24/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
83, 1, birth control,SEVERE depression_ Very moody_ angry all the time_ sugar cravings_ headaches_ cramps all month.,I am crying all the time_ I have no motivation_ the happiness was sucked right out of me. I have also been craving chocolate ( I did not like it before) I don't want to get out of bed. I can't stand this_ I thought maybe it would pass. I am calling my Dr. in the morning. I would rather not take anything_ this is miserable.,F,32,31  days,10/28/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
84, 5, contraceptive,first day i ever took it the next day i got really sick and shaky but after that i felt amazing my skin was so clear and at first yes you do have some bad side effects like being more moody and etc i gained 5 lbs within the 8 monts ive been on it,my skin was so clear_ my sex drive was insane i was always horny like literally_ made my moods amazing i never flipped out it made me more patient and not as mooody or emotional my period lasted 3-4 days was very light_ it just works really good,,18,8  days,10/27/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
85, 1, Regulated Period and Contraceptive,I've been using this for about 2 weeks. I had to switch to this one from using Yaz because my health insurance doesn't cover many doctors and planned parent hood doesn't use Yaz. I hate it_ I've had some extreme mood swings in the past two weeks and it's cost some of my friendships to go down hill. No one even wants to talk to me because I've been highly sensitive to everything. I find myself crying a lot and being really angry and depressed. Other symptoms I've had are nausea and some spotting. I also have been eating a lot more and gaining weight. I see that i'm not the only one who has reacted that way. I really don;t recommend this form of birth control. Especially if you normally are emotional before your period_ it seem to intensify that.,,F,17,2  weeks,10/17/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
86, 1, To not get pregnant,It made me crazy_ my emotions were through the roof.  My sex drive didn't really change_ but it did mess with me emotionally.  It made me paranoid to my signficant other and very vunerable.,In the end I wound up having pulmonary embolism (blood clots in my lungs).  I just turned 30 and now I am scared for my life.  It is not worth it.  I will never take another hormone again.,F,30,3  months,10/13/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
87, 5, Birth Control,None,After being on the patch for 5 years_ I switched to the pill. I went through an ordeal because they first put me on Alesse_ then Yaz. BOTH of those pills broke me out soo bad_ because I am sensitive to drosperinine and levonoregestrel. I was then placed on Ortho-Tri Cyclen..really cleared me up_ but break-through bleeding and some acne improvements_ not much_ so now Ortho Cyclen. IMMEDIATELY cleared up my face after just a few days. I think it is a great pill if you eat right and aren't concerned about your weight. I was coming off of Prednisone_ I was really swollen and I have actually lost weight while on this pill. Everyone seems to hate it_ but it is great for me. I've never experineced mood swings with any contraceptives I've taken so I don't think I'm the best one to ask about that.  With serious weight gain_ that is only going to happen if you don't do something about it after you notice the first 5 pounds. LOWER DOSE pills don't work for my skin_ and niether does Yaz though it claims to be a miracle cure_ so if you feel stuck and you aren't concerned about being able to manage your weight_ you might consider trying this pill.,F,24,1  weeks,9/25/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
88, 1, BC.,depression_ crazy weight gain!!! increase of appetite. super sensitive and real moody_ strong cramps during period_ feeling bloated all the time.,I've switched from ortho tri cyclen lo to regular ortho cyclenand experienced strong side effects immediately!!!!!  in two months i gained about 15 pounds!!!! which is actually my biggest problem. before i was very thin and could eat everything i wanted_ although i had very small appetite.with ortho cyclen i was always hungry and had to watch what i eat and even though i did and started exercising i still gained weight!!!! i also felt very depressed all the time. would wake up in the mornings crying and wanting to just die!!!! i really felt that i want to die and had suicide thought all the time... very dangerous!!! my boobs got sooooooo big that none of my bras fit me anymore!! and i feel very uncomfortable. also they are very tender.this pill made me feel terrible!!!i just got off it two weeks ago and got back to tri cyclen lo. i am less moody but the other side effects didn't clear up yet. does anyone knows how long will it take to lose the extra weight??? please write me back on this site.,F,25,2  months,9/19/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
89, 3, stronger hormones,"Weird thoughts. Some breast tenderness. Strong_ intense emotions. Some nausea. ""Hormone"" headache pressure - it's really not a headache but pressure in the front of my head that comes about when my hormones are ""on high"".I anticipate these to abate after a couple of pill packs.",I've not completed the first pill pack yet. The pharmacist explicitly warned me that the intended effects may not be evident until the 2nd or 3rd pill pack as it takes time to adjust to the new Rx. He also indicated that some of the effects I experience at first may be not so pleasant and that may or may not happen that way. I was taking Yaz and I was starting to spot throughout the cycle after being on it for 2 years (I'm in my early 40s)_ so my physician recommended going to a stronger formulation.I'm not spotting at all and I feel pretty weird. I felt similarly when I started the Yaz a couple of years ago and in a few months_ the side effects were nominal. I anticipate the effects to abate to nominal annoyance (less annoying than the tumult I was experience before the Pill - trust me_ crying just because you looked at your phone blows).,F,43,14  days,9/11/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
90, 1, Birth Control,I have only been taking this pill for about 3 weeks and hate it. I am currently taking anti depressant pills and they use to work a little before but now I am worse. I cry all the time. I freak out on my boyfriend about the littlest things and start fights. I totally agree with everyone when they say it's a relationship ruiner. Lucky my boyfriend has dealt with this moodiness better then I have. I keep saying I feel crazy. I also never get acne and now that I am taking Ortho Cyclen I broke out so bad. After this pack I am done.,I also started my period 2 weeks early and have been on it for 11 days so far. I thought that would happen but not the other syptomes. I am an emotional person but not like this. it makes you feel CRAZy!!!!,F,19,3  weeks,9/8/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
91, 5, for birth control,In the beginning_ I broke out a little more than normal_ and I had mood swings and low sex drive. Now my face is clearer than its ever been_ my sex drive is fine (not what it was_ I think_ but still not bad) and I've put on a few pounds_ although I wasn't a big girl in the beginning so I don't really mind. (If I gain anymore tho I may have to start back exercising regularly) Overall_ not a bad pill. Lutera (what I was on before) was horrible.,My breasts rounded out some too.,F,20,3  months,8/27/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
92, 2, acne_ heavy periods_ cramps,serious weight gain_ periods were still heavy_ didnt help acne_ no sex drive_ nausea,i have extremely heavy periods with cramps so bad i could hardly move. it made my periods a little lighter and the cramps weren't as bad but it didnt help my acne. i felt sick all the time and threw up atleast once a week usually more. i gained about 20 to 30 pounds in the first 2 months and 45 overall. i used to be in good shape but now i cant even fit into most of my clothes. i was tired all the time like i didnt sleep at all. i couldnt drink alcohol at all. id drink 1 beer and throw up. i lost all desire for sex which is no fun especially since in still young,F,20,5  months,8/25/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
93, 2, regulate my period,acne on nose_ chin_ cheeks_ bloating_ mild vaginal infection,I've been on this pill for about 3 weeks and stopped before the pack was done due to my breakouts.  I've had mild acne on and off for years but have never broken out like this...13 different spots within a week_ and they are painful.  I've also had uncomfortable bloating and a mild_ almost yeast-infection like irritation.  The only positive is that it has helped to fill out my body since I'm a bit underweight_ and my breasts are fuller too.  But I'm not taking this anymore--I want my clear face back.,F,25,3.5  weeks,7/23/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
94, 2, birth control_ period regulation,Negatives: weight gain_ increased hunger_ strange cravings_ breast tenderness_ irritability/sensitivity_ fatigue_ hair loss_ strange eyelash growth patterns_ intense cramping_ heavy period on start day.Positives: clear skin_ breast growth_ short periods,"I was taking Mononessa_ the generic form of Ortho Cyclen. I initially thought I was gaining a little weight because I went from going to the gym 5 times a week to going 3 times a week_ but I continued to gain weight even while eating well. I have always been thin_ but this pill made me gain weight in ""womanly"" areas: lower abdomen_ hips_ thighs_ and breasts. I think my body doesn't know where to store all of this excess estrogen. Also_ my eyelashes started growing erratically. New lashes grew in straight_ shot off in strange directions_ and were slightly above my lash line. I'm not positive this is from the pill_ but it's a strange occurrence that began when I started taking it. I'm switching back to Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo; hopefully these effects will diminish soon.",F,27,4  months,7/10/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
95, 3, to prevent pregnancy,i only got sick the first couple of days and after that i was fine.  ive lost over 20 pounds since I started taking this pill 7 months ago_ im not sure it was because of the pills or not because I havent really done anything different_ so thats a plus.  the only thing that i really dont like about the pill is that my sex drive has gone way way down.,,F,26,6  months,6/28/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
96, 1, BC,breast tenderness_ nausea_ vomiting_ headaches_ neck aches_ mild acne_ very irritable_ lack of libido,,F,27,3.5  weeks,6/15/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
97, 3, BC_ regulate periods,BREAST TENDERNESS_ Increased Breast Size_ Irritability_ Moodswings_ Hot & Cold Labido_ Incessant Hunger,I am one of those people that has struggled with severe side effects with almost every type of hormonal BC. The worst one that I have tried was Depo Provera (I had almost every side effect possible).  I had the most success in the past with Lunelle (no longer available in the US) and the Nuvaring (which had minimal side effects).  I will continue to take this for the next 3 months to see if things level out and I will report back.,F,28,3.5  weeks,6/9/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
98, 3, birth control,mood swings_ weight gain_ breast pain_ constant hunger_ fatigue_ nausea,Sometimes I literally feel like this pill makes me crazy. I will cry or yell about anything at the drop of a hat. I've gained about 10lbs since I started taking it and I am pretty little so it is noticeable. Frequently_ my boobs hurt_ I am always hungry. Before I started taking it I always had a little appetite. I constantly crave sugar. The first 3 weeks I was nauseous every day all day. I hate it.,F,20,3  months,5/16/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
99, 3, birth control,"would sometimes have extreme nipple tenderness_ on about my 3rd ""green pill day"" (no hormone pill) i would be very emotional and would sometimes cry for no reason at all_ seemed tired and would crave sweets on my period which was unusual for me.",i guess the only plus is i never got pregnant...,F,28,12  months,5/11/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
100, 1, balancing hormones,decreased libido_ increased depression_ weight gain_ uncontrolled eating_ neck pain with headache to follow on occasion,I was taking this to help balance my hormones because I had endometriosis and low libido.  I don't know if it helped the balance_ but it sure seemed not to.  I didn't think the libido could get any worse before I started this pill_ but it did.  So disappointed.,F,40,3.5  months,4/28/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
101, 2, prevent period every 3 months,I started taking Yaz and found out the dosage wasn't strong enough to prevent my period when taking the active pills continuously.  I got my period on March 30th and asked my doctor for a diff pill that would prevent my periods.  She put me on Ortho-Cyclen.  I started Ortho-Cyclen on April 2 and my period lasted 2 whole weeks.  That's longer than my regular period before I started the pill.  I've been on Ortho-Cyclen and started my 2nd pack active pills today and my period came again and I have cramps.  I just finished that other period from March 2 weeks ago!  I think I should try a diff pill again.,,F,35,21  days,4/22/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
102, 2, Birth control,I came to this site from a google site - hoping to find answers to my problems with this pill.  I have experienced terrrible mood swings_ always fighting with my boyfriend about nothing_ everything seemed to piss me off.  I've noticed all my pants fitting tighter and terrible stomach pains just after taking the pill. Although no cramping_ I'll take them over these issues any day!!!,I've been on many different pills_ I'm switching back to Yasmin.  It was the best I have taken.  Cleared up acne for me and did not affect my moods.  Those worried about the cost some health insurances cover it and if not some pharmacies work with clinics to keep the price affordable ...I get mine for 14 dollars/month!,F,27,2  months,4/13/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
103, 1, cramping,nausea_ vomiting_ headaches_ always tired and sleepy,i started on this pill on Sunday so i took it for 2 days_ ever since i been throwing up non stop_ i cant eat because am so nauseous and afraid to throw up. My doctor switched me to a lower dose of hormones and put me on lutera_ i am still nauseous and still throwing up. i haven't had a meal in 2 days_ i weigh 115lb i am probably like 112 now lol. i hate birth control i  think am doneeee with all birth control.,F,24,3  days,4/8/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
104, 3, Birth Control,Heavy bleeding,I changed from Tri to just plane cyclen a monh and a half ago.  My headaches vanished_ and my depression has completely lifted.  I have not noticed any weight gain_ and I never really had a problem with adult achne.  I am however concerned about the bleeding.  At first it was just spotting...now I am all out bleeding and wondering how long this is going to last.,F,37,1.5  months,3/26/2009Email,Ortho cyclen-21
105, 2, ,Nausea_ mood swings_ lack of sex drive,I have only been on this pill for about 1 week and have come to the internet looking for any side effects to this medicine. i came across this site and found all the symptoms I am having. After the first few days of starting it I have noticed I am always naseous and little things irritate me very much. I know it is the pill so I have not been eating nonstop to fight the nausea but I can't walk around constantly feeling like this! I just had a baby 2 months ago_ don't really want to go off the pill_ but I think it is the option I am going to end up going to. I tried many different pills before my pregnancy and non worked as I had hoped.,F,24,10  days,3/26/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
106, 5, Birth control and regulator,slight bloating,I have tried many different levels and kinds of pills and this is the one for me! I have had many issues with excessive bleeding and vomiting during my periods and now I am in control again. I do get a little bloating but nothing more than I would've got during a  regular cylce anyway. This is my life saver_ I can actually go out and not have to worry about spilage _ overflow and embarassment. I find this pill works just as effectively as other doses and types of BC pills but it has the least side effects. I have had issues with other pills causing depression and ortho cyclen-21 does NOT effect me mentally in any way! :) thankyou for my life back!!,F,22,2  years,3/24/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
107, 5, birth control,Tender breasts,This pill is fantastic!  I was on alesse for years then switched to aviane.  I had no sex drive and terrible mood swings.  As soon as I switched to this pill I felt like my old self again.  My happy personality is back_ my sex life is better than ever_ and the only side effect is occasional breast tenderness.  Great pill!,F,28,2  months,3/24/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
108, 5, Birth Control,breast tenderness_ minor chest pains for a few seconds (only for the first week)_ after that i experienced weight loss_ and my acne cleared up,I love this pill. I have to say_ to each their own with this pill. I was so nervous after reading what all the other patients had to say about it. This is my first time on this pill... i'm 23 and really don't like taking anything unnatural. The first week i noticed my breasts were a little tender but to be honest_ I think I got all the benefits other than that. My skin cleared up (I had some acne on my back too which was cleared up)_ I lost weight_ I feel like my sex drive has increased now that I'm not as worried about everything and I feel better with my skin_ and my weight. I mean_ to each their own_ don't be discouraged by all the negative comments on this page.,F,22,3  weeks,3/17/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
109, 2, Birth control,Acne within 2 weeks_ breast tenderness_ increased appetite_ mood swings_ bloating,Thought it would calm the acne_ but it made it increase.  I stopped taking anything for 3 months and my skin cleared completely.  I started the OC21 and it came back like a bad nightmare.  I gained weight and I was depressed.  Oh the wonders of medicine.,F,27,8  months,3/7/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
110, 4, Birth control,No side effect for 12 years....last two years had break through bleeding and some bleeding after sex.  My doctor switched me off of it to Mircette but I am noticing mood swings_ axiety_ and my face broke out.,I thought this pill worked great and I had very limited side effects until I got older...over 30.,F,31,14  years,3/3/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
111, 3, birth control... cramping,I had sharp pains in my stomach_ nausea_ vomiting_ headaches_ dizziness_ fever_ weight gain,I was previously on this a few years ago and i loved it. I had to start it again because of lasting break through bleeding on a different pill they switched me to. Now this time i feel nauseated_ im vomiting_ i am dizzy_ have headaches_ a fever_ and already gained 4lbs in 3 weeks. Not to mention the pains i have been getting in my stomach in later afternoon hrs.,F,22,3  weeks,3/2/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
112, 2, needed bcp_ prevent pregnancy_,weight gain_extremely tired all the time (fatigue)_ crave sugar a lot_,cons are-well i am always tired all the time and get tired easily. also seem to always be hungry so i gained weight. and i cant seem to lose it even w/exercise. i work out at least 3x a week to no avail.(probably due to craving sugar)the pros are- that my skin is always clear_no effect on sex drive_ minimal to no cramping_ periods are predictable and short.,F,25,2  years,2/23/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
113, 4, Birth Control,I haven't experience too many side effects_ however I do notice that I am very moody about a week and a half before my period_ which is normal for me_ but it seems to be a bit increased with the medicine.  I also notice that around this time I crave alot of sugar so I just have to be extra conscious of what I'm eating so I don't gain weight...so far so good.,I was actually afraid to take birth control_ because I recently lost over 60 pounds and I didn't want to do anything to make myself gain weight.  So far I haven't gained any weight_ but I do notice that around my cycle I crave horrible foods and I am extremely moody and irritable.  These things are normal for my cycle anyway_ but they seemed to be a bit increased with the taking of this pill.  All in all I am very happy with this pill_ and I'm glad that I haven't experienced some of the side effects that others have.,F,30,30  days,2/16/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
114, 3, menstrual migrains and acne,I've been on Ortho Cyclen for nearly 6 months now. I noticed early on that I needed to 'have' a period every 2 months to keep me from going 'crazy'.  During the period_ I would experience headaches_ but none as bad as prior to this new Rx.  The pros of the med.. my breasts GREW a lot however_ I gained 10 lbs... which is REALLY RARE for me so I KNOW it's the pill.  My acne cleared up beautifully_ too.  As much as I am pleased with the acne improvement and limited migraines_ I can't stand the weight gain.  I will likely go off all pills for a bit and get my weight and my 'mood' back to normal (is there such a thing?) and then I'll decide what_ if anything else I can use to regulate my periods.  I don't need birth control_ as I had a TL a few years ago after an emergency c/s_ so I have options that many others might not have otherwise.,It's a very useful pill but I highly recommend having a period at least every 2-3 months to keep  your moods in check.  As for weight gain... it's a definite and though I like the impact to my bustline_ the rest of it has got to go! I've NEVER gained weight like this before_ so I can easily say it's the pill!,F,42,6  months,2/10/2009Email,Ortho cyclen-21
115, 4, period regularity,acne_ hunger fluctuations,i have been on it for a couple weeks and i haven't noticed any major changes in my weight or my personality or my sex drive. if anything_ i'm happier. the acne seems to have stayed about the same_ may have gotten a little worse_ but it's manageable. i really do love having the regularity and being able to predict when i'll start_ as well as that extra protection and assurance that i will not get pregnant when i become sexually active. it's a very good birth control so far!! (i've never been on anything else),F,17,14  days,2/3/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
116, 5, Birth Control,I never had any!,I've been taking Ortho Cyclen for 9 years in May 09_ and it has been great to me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone! My only concern is: how long is too long to continue taking the pill? Anyone have any feedback?,F,27,9  years,1/17/2009Email,Ortho cyclen-21
117, 2, Birth control,I had severe pain in my abdomen_ nausea_ vomiting_ and headaches.,I stopped taking it because of the pain on my abdomen_ but it really helped my period.  Hardly any cramping and I bled for only 5 days_ which had been 7 or 8 heavy days for the past several months after I had my daughter.,F,26,2  months,1/16/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
118, 1, ,Sore breasts_ MOOD SWINGS_ yeast infection_ spotting for 6 weeks and still hasn't stopped.,I am so happy I found this site. I thought there was something really wrong with me. I have endometriosis. Mt GYN put me on this pill to treat it. The up side is I have had zero pain for the first time in 4 years. The down side is I am very moody I have been spotting for 6 weeks straite and I have no sex drive. My poor husband is going crazy. I am too scared that I still have this yeast infection that I have had for 6 weeks. I have self treated 3 times and took that pill from my GP for 3 weeks. Nothing is getting rid of it. I go back to my GYN in 2 weeks and I am going to tell her I want off this stupid pill. I want my body back!,F,31,16  weeks,1/13/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
119, 1, PCOS symptoms,nausea_ tiredness_ irritability,I had been on BC when I was a teenage to help with my period and prevent pregnancy_ but it made me super irritable_ so I stopped.  My doc suggested I go back on BC because of my really irregular periods_ so I told him I would as long as it wasn't one of the tricyclic ones...well this one has made me just as irritable and being nauseated everyday is really getting annoying.  I'm glad to see I'm not alone!  I'm going off it_ thanks for the help everyone posting here.,F,23,2  weeks,1/12/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
120, 4, constant bleeding on the ring,some dizziness,I started taking this pill 2X a day because I was having severe bleeding problems on NuvaRing (turns out I naturally produce more than twice the amount of natural estrogen than that ring gave me) and it dried me up right away. Even at twice the dosage_ I haven't had any of the side effects (nausea_ vomiting_ severe mood swings_ etc) that a lot of the people on here have complained about. It's been a nice turnaround from the barrage of side effects I normally get from other forms of birth control. I highly recommend it.,F,21,2  months,1/2/2009,Ortho cyclen-21
121, 2, Uterine Fibroids& prevent pregnancy,Nausea_ Moodiness_ Anxiety_ and Yeast Infections,I know that everyone reacts to pills differently_ so talk to your doctor.  I have been on this pill for 4 months_ but have not gotten used to it yet.  I was on a higher hormone before (OrthoNovum) for almost 2 years_ but it was giving me migraines and depression.  I have had a recurring yeast infection with OrthoCyclen,F,25,4  months,11/25/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
122, 3, Prevent preg._ regulate PCOS,I've been on it for a week and a half.  The first few days I was VERY emotional and got really light headed.  The worst side effect has been breat tenderness_ which hasn't gone away with the other side effect.  My breasts are KILLING me!,,F,23,11  days,11/24/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
123, 2, acne_ birthcontrol,YEAST INFECTIONS,the first week on cyclen i had extreme naseau but that eased once i took it with food and then adjusted to the hormones. I started to really like this pill as it cured acne and i had no other side effects until the yeast infections occured. I have never had one before and now have had one for the past two months. i have taken diflucan and topical cream constantly and it only eases it but never heals it. I am considering switching to another pill as my pill before did not cause these!(alesse was too weak for me),F,19,2  months,11/13/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
124, 5, Birth Control,Some nausea and irritability within the first few weeks. Nausea was only in the morning and went away in a few hours.,The first few weeks were the hardest_ but after that_ it was a breeze. The only reason I got off of it was because I ran out without being able to make my refill appointment. I'm going to get more next week. A lot of people may have had an unejoyable experience with this pill but once your body adapts to it_ it really is not bad. It made my periods last about 4 days instead of 7 days and the intense pain I experienced from cramps was greatly decreased-I only had to take 1 Midol a day compared to the 4 I used to take every day of my cycle.,F,17,3  months,11/10/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
125, 1, BC,Nausea_ enlarged ovaries/severe pain Exp with exercise_ yeast infection_ Severe mood swings_ depression_ dryness and low libido_ blood in urine,I am so miserable with this pill_ i have been on it for 6 months and the first few weeks i was just adjusting to the hormones it wasnt fun but its normal. But with the 5th and 6th month i have been having severe pain in my ovaries_ there enlarged( i thought i had Endometriosis) within this past week i feel nauseous. I have been overly depressed to the point where my boyfriend gets frustrated with me telling me that i used to be so confident. I used to be very sexually active and now act like i am married and try to find ways out of it_ its dryer so its more uncomfortable. I am paranoid i am going to get another yeast infection because of the pill also_ something i didnt know a pill could cause. I have blood in my urine and it feels like i have an off again on again bladder infection(been tested for it and STD's i have NONE) I finally got sick of dealing with the pain_ went to a gynecologist and found out that she Hates that brand_ she says its the one with the most symptoms.,F,20,6  months,11/6/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
126, 1, birth control,nausea_ vomiting_ depression_ paranoid thoughts_ fatigue,"I was initially on Ortho trycyclen-lo_ but my doctor switched me to regular dosage so that I could get a cheaper generic brand at the pharmacy (monetarily it's great_ I spend $10/month as opposed to $50/month). However as soon as I started the cycle I had extreme ""morning sickness"" and vomited twice in the first week. It was so bad that I took a pregnancy test just to rule that out due to the symptoms. I've also been breaking out on my neck and back which never used to be an issue_ and what little acne I had on my face seems to never go away now! I've also gone through episodes of hysterically crying for no reason and generally being depressed out of the blue. I also have a lower libido and more dryness ""down there."" I've always been a little tired due to a stressful schedule_ but since this pill it seems like I could fall asleep at the drop of a hat and never have as much energy as I used to. STICK WITH THE LOWER DOSAGE!!",F,24,2  months,10/22/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
127, 3, birth control,NAUSEA_ mood swings_ depression_ etc.,Ortho cyclen made me very sick to the point where it was reminiscent of morning sickness nausea (without the vomiting).  I didn't feel in control and was anxious.  It didn't help with acne_ but it didn't make it worse either.  I had zero weight gain - if anything I lost weight because it made me sick.  I won't go back on it.,F,24,4  months,10/13/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
128, 4, BC,The first couple weeks on this BC pill_ I was nauseous AND extremely hungry at the same time.  My breasts were sore.  I got headaches.  I had terrible mood swings [I had those before I went on the pill though... so I really can't blame it].  The side effects faded though.  I've gone through two packs and I'm fine now.,Just stick with it.  You will experience side effects_ but most of the time they do go away.  It's a good pill to start out on_ they say.  I couldn't agree more.  Now that my body has adjusted_ I see no reason to change to one of these new-fangled expensive pills_ when this works just as well.,F,20,2  months,10/8/2008,Ortho cyclen-21

132, 2, Birth control,Severe moodiness 3 days before my period. Hysterical crying spells_ irritability_ depression_ restlessness (I once made my boyfriend hold a pillow while I punched it HARD). I've always had acne_ so while I can't say that this drug has caused it_ it definitely hasn't made it go away.,After landing my first long-term boyfriend_ I went on Ortho-Cyclen for birth control reasons (while also hoping that it would clear up my acne - it didn't). A few days after starting the drug_ I got my period - and bleed for about 2 weeks. Not normal. My periods_ though sometimes irregular_ are usually pretty light. So I went to my doctor and she put me on the generic version_ Sprintec_ which was okay by me since it wasn't  as pricey. Unfortunately_ Sprintec has come with MAJOR PMS PROBLEMS. I get really moody and depressed right before my period_ and I'm worried this is affecting my relationship with my boyfriend (this weekend_ I sobbed so hard i practically made myself throw up - just got my period today). I think I'm definitely going back on Ortho. Yaz would be good_ but it's even more expensive. But God_ I need to do something to get rid of these moods.,F,21,4  months,9/21/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
133, 2, Birth Control,Weight Gain_ spotting_ SEVER acne,I switched from Ortho tri cyclen lo to Ortho Cyclen and at first it was great.  I was happier and I finally stopped picking fights for no reason with my husband.  For the past couple of months I started getting terrible cystic acne all over my cheeks and jawbone.  I have always had perfect skin. People would always compliment me and now I am embarrassed to even go out of the house without tons of coverup on.  I have red splotches and scarring that feels like its never going away.  I have also gained about 10 pounds that are not going away even though I eat healthy and exercise regularly.,F,28,8  months,9/12/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
134, 3, PCOS / period regulation,Nausea_ fatigue_ low sex drive,After going from doctor to doctor for nearly 8 years_ I finally found and Ob/Gyn that specializes in endocrinology and hormones.  I've not had a period for the last 3 years and the doctor was very concerned about ovarian cancer.  Will go for unltra-sound on the 12th just to confirm all is well. Blood tests came back great.  Dr. put me on Provera for 10 days_ then 10 days after the last pill I started my first cycle.  It was heavy but not horribly uncomfortable.  I then started Sprintec 2 weeks ago.  1 week after taking the pills I had a second period - but Dr. said that because my body hasn't had periods in such a long time_ now that it's triggered it's going to try and shed all the lining that it can.  A good sign actually.  The worst side effect that I've experienced is the constant nausea.  30 min. after taking the pill I'm sick at my stomach - and it lasts all day.  I'm extremely tired right now_ but it could also be because of low iron due to two periods in as many weeks.  Low sex,F,33,2.5  weeks,9/5/2008,Ortho cyclen-21

137, 1, birth control,NO SEX DRIVE. Moodiness. Tired_ breast pain.,I honestly believe the only reason this is birth control is because it makes you entirely turned off to the idea of sex. Going on birth control for contraception generally implies wanting to have sex but once I started this I never initiated sex_ wanted to have sex_ or could achieve orgasm when my boyfriend managed to get me to have sex. I have been on other pills before and never experienced this. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. Can't wait to switch.,F,21,8  months,8/30/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
138, 1, birth control,Mood swings_ depression and anxiety,I have been on this pill for 6 years and I didn't have a problem in the beginning_ atleast I don't remember having any.  But for the past year I have been extremely moody_ crying for no reason_ I swear my boyfriend of 5 years is cheating on me and is about to leave me any day now.  I'm overly sensitive and think everyone is out to get me.  And sex drive?  What sex drive?  I don't know why I feel this way but I can't take it anymore.  I need to either get off for good or get a new pill_ but don't want to go through more side effects.,F,32,6  years,8/26/2008,Ortho cyclen-21

141, 2, Birth Control/Regulate Cycle/Acne,Very tired_ increased appetite and weight_ some headaches with Sprintec and Tri-Sprintec.,Ortho Tricyclen - 5 yearsTrisprintec - 4 monthsSPrintec - 1 weekPrior to having kids I successfully took Ortho Tricyclen and loved it.  It helped with acne and my body was well adjusted to the cycles.  Now_ 6 years later (and 3 kids) my doc put me on Tri-Sprintec.  It didn't work -- I bled 3 out of 4 weeks and it didn't help with acne.  After 4 months of Trisprintec_ I finally switched.  Last week I started Sprintec and it's making me extra tired all the time_ increased my appetite_ and mild headaches. These Sprintec and Tri Sprintec are the generic versions of Ortho Cyclen and Ortho Tri Cyclen_ and from what I understand the are not identical chemically -- they're just supposed to provide the same results.  Many women have had luck with these_ just as many women (such as me) have had bad luck with these generics.  I guess we just have to try different things to see what works with our bodies.,F,33,4  months,6/15/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
142, 1, Birth Control,I'm so upset. I was on Sprintec for awhile_ then went off_ and now on it again. I've only been taking it 5 days but already the same side effects are happening. I'm depressed_ don't want to get out of bed_ and sleeping all day. This morning I felt like I was going to throw up. The last time I was on it it almost ruined my relationship with my boyfriend. I was so paranoid I was sure he was cheating on me_ I was terrible to him and my family. I avoided friends_ and had migraines that lasted for days. No aspirin would help_ so I stayed in bed with the lights off. I dont know what to do_ I also take BC for ovarian cysts which have burst in the past_ so I need to be on this but am freaked out. Also the last time I was on it I gained 10 lbs out of nowhere. Be careful.,,F,23,5  days,6/10/2008Email,Ortho cyclen-21

146, 4, Birth Control,I've taken Ortho Tri-Cyclen for roughly 10 years with no problems until I started spotting so now I'm on Ortho Cyclen. The Ortho brand is a very good pill overall. I'm in my third month and still spotting but it happened later in the cycle so I'm hoping next month I won't spot at all. To my knowledge_ this is the strongest pill from this brand_ and I do not want to change (tried Levora and it was horrible - I started breaking out within the first month and stopped). I have never broken out from Ortho pills.,FOR THE WOMEN WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MOOD SWINGS_ DEPRESSION_ ETC.: I suffered from this and thought it was the pill. It is not. My boyfriend packed his bags twice over my mood swings. He didn't move out_ but I knew he would if I didn't do something so I started researching. Most women do not get the proper nutrition and that was the cause. I now take daily a multi-vitamin_ a B-complex (known for it's mood benefits) and Calcium + D (which I read would help PMS). Taking these 3 supplements daily I have had no depression or crazy mood swings. I know vitamins seem like a simple answer_ but they are amazing. Life is so much better for me and my boyfriend.,F,28,3  months,5/26/2008,Ortho cyclen-21

I was never happy_ always screaming at my bf for NO reason_ and I would even literally hit him sometimes out of anger! This pill changed me so much and you are NOT the same person. I am warning you do not take this pill!! Ive seen comments about people calling it a relationship ruiner and I completely agree!! I was really starting to believe I was just going crazy and turing into a psyco but now I feel better! However_ when I went to see my DR._ he said it would take some time for my body to adjust back to normal.,F,21,2  days,3/13/2008,Ortho cyclen-21

Tonight_ after reading others side effects I know it's not me it's this pill.,,M,29,4  months,2/20/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
151, 2, Birth Control_ Cramps_ Heavy Period,VERY emotional (depressed_ anxious & irritable)_ worse acne_ sore boobs_ slight water weight gain_ bloating_ and I have not stopped BLEEDING since my first period on Ortho-Cyclen.  EVERY DAY I EXPERIENCE BLEEDING.,I cannot stop crying and I've also had suicidal thoughts for no reason.  My periods are still heavy and painful.  I feel like I have PMS every single day. The only reason I give Ortho-Cyclen a '2' is because it is birth control-- the main reason I am taking it. I wish I was a guy!,F,24,5  months,2/6/2008,Ortho cyclen-21
152, 2, to prevent pregnancy,I have been taking ortho cyclen for years.  When I was in my teens and earlier 20's it was fine_ but at some point after turning 23 I've become an absolute wreck.  I've heard a lot of bad press about this pill_ and after reading some other reviews_ I'm begining to think it's far more suitable for a younger woman.  There are times when I've felt posessed.  I snap_ I cry for no reason_ not just cry_ bawling.  Sometimes I know full well that nothing is actually wrong_ but I can't control how awful/angry I feel.  Also my zits have been just insane_ espically in corilation whith the moodswings.  For what it's worth_ I'm so relieved to read all of this.  I really felt like I was going crazy.  Tonight I tool my last ortho-cyclen ever_ and I can't wait to switch to ANYTHING else.  I'm going to ask my doctor about Yaz.  Thanks again for everyone who has posted!,I am never going to take this pill again,F,24,8  years,1/27/2008,Ortho cyclen-21

154, 2, Birth Control,Severe nausea_ tired and sick all the time.,I was initially put on the ortho-lo version_ and due to a mix-up between my doctor_ my pharmacy at home_ and my pharmacy at school_ I ended up at the normal dosage. If you are petite (I weight 115 pounds)_ the pill will be TOO STRONG for you. A doctor by my school says she rarely prescribes it to those who weigh less than 150 pounds. I took my pill at noon every day and was often puking by 1:30. I could only get a few bites of dinner in before the nausea hit again. I lost ten pounds in 6 weeks (without any exercise at all). I was fine_ however_ over the summer on ortho-lo. Just be careful if you are small!,F,20,5  months,1/19/2008,Ortho cyclen-21

156, 3, Irregular Periods/Cramps,Orthocyclen had some side effects when I first started (nausea_ continued cramping around periods_ breast tenderness_ slight gas)_ but most went away after several months.  I experienced those side effects after I switched back from Sprintec (the generic version) as well.  For me Sprintec caused more problems than the Ortho during the few years I took it_ including occasional spotting_ more moodiness_ decreased sex drive_ more acne and cramping.  I also experienced hairloss/accelerated shedding on Sprintec (although that may or may not have been due to Sprintec_ as doctors can't really determine the cause of telogen effluvium) .,The side effects were mostly in the beginning when my body was adjusting to the pill and while the hormones are not without some minor side effects_ the benefits of regular/shortened periods_ less acne and decreased cramping are worth the pill. Also_ when looking at comments_ look at how long the people have been taking any pill on this site(remember it can take the body several months to adjust to any pill).,F,27,13  years,12/18/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
157, 5, birth control,headaches_ some early bleeding,I've been on 6 different types of BC. Nuva Ring was the best and I loved it.... but my acne slowly came back over a long period of time. So far Ortho Cyclen has been the only method that has helped clear up my skin and NOT made me a pscyho_ or my hormones out of control. I do headaches sometimes and a little bleeding_ but of all the side effects I've had to deal with on the pill those are nothing.I'm VERY happy with Ortho Cyclen so far.,F,23,1  months,12/5/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
158, 3, pregnancy prevention,Horrible mood swings! Took me 5 months after I started to get it under control (may just be having a good day right now). Affected relationship with my boyfriend and got to the point where my friends didn't want to go out with me anymore because I always started some kind of drama or had an emotional breakdown. Also_ excessive discharge in between periods. Started a month after I started the pill. Have a commited relationship - so wasn't worried about it being an STD or anything. Still got checked anyway - and it all came out negative. So - it is most likely the pill and probably the most annoying side effect of it. It's so bad I have to wear a liner every day and change it 3 times a day! Definitely changing to a different pill.,,F,23,5  months,12/4/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
159, 5, Birth control,Slightly increased appetite and slight weight gain (<5 lb),I switched from a generic of Loestrin because that caused weight gain_ depression_ loss of libido and hair loss for me. After 4 months I have not noticed any of those symptoms aside from slight weight gain which could is slight enough to be a natural fluctuation. I do take it at almost exactly the same time every day_ but when I have occasionally been an hour or so late nothing has happened and I haven't gotten pregnant. Of course_ that doesn't mean I can make a recommendation for anyone else_ but I love this and don't plan on switching any time soon.,F,20,4  months,11/28/2007,Ortho cyclen-21

I feel like I'm periodically going insane - from totally normal to ridiculously sad and/or angry for no real reason.  I am convinced that my boyfriend is more in love with his video games than with me (which may ACTUALLY be true_ I'm not sure yet - still sounds paranoid to me).  I've also begun bleeding with excruciating cramps with 13 pills left to take.  My last period on this pill lasted for 10 days straight.  After bleeding for an entire 3.5 months on the shot_ I was searching for birth control that would regulate my periods.  Sadly_ this is not it.,I've heard good and bad things about this birth control_ so if your doctor prescribes it_ it's worth trying.,F,27,2  months,10/28/2007,Ortho cyclen-21

163, 2, Freedom_ no babies_ regulation,I dont like using condoms so I decided to try birth control. I've tried this pill 3 times. The first time I was soo moody and was uncontrollably crying about nothing. The second time I was bleeding all the time and didnt stop.... This time!!! I broke out_nausea all the time_ breast tenderness_ Migraines_and always tired but can't sleep. Most of all... I've gained alot of weight (every time I've used this birth control) which i'm not too happy about and that alone has turned my sex drive all the way off_and I usually have a really high sex drive may I add_ I'm soo self consious now a days. I hate it. I'm always worried and emotional about things that I usually dont care too much or worry about.I have tight chest pains. change in apetite_ headaches_ nervousness_ and the worst is I'm even more depressed now than before taking this pill (which was severe)I dont recommend!!!!!!!!!

169, 4, Birth Control,I was on Ortho Cyclen for several years before the Dr. decided to 'try' ortho-low on me. I didn't really want the change but it was new and I went for it. I was on it a year and it was pretty much the same to me. Then_ about a year and a half ago I went back to Ortho-Cyclen because I wanted to take it through and not have a period. I was pregnant within in the first 6 months. I decided to stay on Ortho-Cyclen but let my period come each month. It is an effective birth control but since I have been on it again I have gained 20 pounds_ gone up 2 cups sizes (from a full B to a small D) get insane mood swings and SERIOUS oms where I just SCREAM for nothing and have to appologize 5 minutes later for my rediculous actions. I feel sick a lot and tired all the time! I have also started getting chest pains. I think this is all associated with going back on ortho-cyclen and may be switching back to low. Maybe it is reacting to me differently now that I'm older.,,F,26,8  years,8/8/2007Email,Ortho cyclen-21

175, 5, birth control_ bad cramping,at first i was very moody (always upset and crying) and cramping didn't ease up (it was BEYOND intense before i went on it)_ i also had very irregular periods for about 6 months.,NOW? a lot less moody_ cramping is much better_ not really any weight gain_ clearer skin_ and i'm now very regular. i really think the key to ortho-cyclen is that you have to keep at it because i have been on it for about 2 years now and it has really helped me!,F,19,2  years,3/30/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
176, 3, for acne & contraception,I was orginally on the shot... I literally bled for 4 months straight!... not to mention it killed my relationship.  So be careful on that.  I then went on Ortho Tri Cyclen and it gave me lots of mood swings... I didn't realize that then and just thought everything was going wrong... it's only now after trying different ones that I've realized it... I'm sure by boyfriend would have appreciated knowing this then as well.  I'm now on Ortho Cyclen and it's definitely working on the contraception but more so the acne a lot better... but u have to take it around the same time daily or it might make your acne appear in small amounts again for a bit.  My biggest problem is that I gained 10 lbs in like 3 months & I get really depressed/sensitive about every subject.  e.g. I'll cry more easily & let things bother me alot for no reason.  I got off of it for 2 weeks and sure enough_ I lost a bit of weight_ I wasn't always trying to munch on something_ and the same subjects that used to up,,F,26,6  months,3/7/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
177, 4, Birth control,I've been taking the generic Sprintec and I think it has either caused or contributed to anxiety_ nervousness and mood swings. Way more irritable and sensitive.,I'm getting off the pill and getting the copper IUD paraguard because I don't want the side effects of hormones.,F,22,5  years,2/28/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
178, 3, Birth control,Menstrual migraines that are still here!! Also- Slight nausea when I first started each month -HUGE appetite and weight gain,It's better than some contraceptives_ but I could not handle the migraines at all. It's been over a year and they are still here. My doctor said they may stay with me until menopause.,F,21,1  years,2/20/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
179, 4, safer sex,a bit more painful cramps a few days before my period and slight weight gain.,its great i was on alesse and it sucked and same with the patch. i have no problems with cyclen. it shortend my periods from 5 days to 3 days. i also dont break out as much before my period. i never have any spotting as well,F,18,2  years,2/13/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
180, 3, prevent pregnancy,none other than a severe itching rash on neck and legs that started on the 3rd day of taking the pills and is still happening on the 11th day right now..,,F,25,11  days,2/6/2007Email,Ortho cyclen-21
181, 3, contraception/regulate periods,Break through bleeding_ moodiness_ breast tenderness_ decrease in sex drive,I am taking the generic Mononessa_ and it does what it should as far as stopping pregnancy. But breakthrough bleeding is horrible. For the first week I am good to go_ but then comes the second and third week and I have breakthrough bleeding. And because of that there is less sex due to being so irratated from bleeding. I am calling my doc to change.,F,22,6  months,1/10/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
182, 1, birth controll,Weight gain_ mood swings_ long periods_depression.,I was taking microgestin_ and it made me spot in between periods. so my doctor put me on ortho cyclen. That's when I noticed I was working out_ but not losing any weight. I was always mad and upset about everything_ and depressed. I also are experiencing LOW sex drive. Do NOT recomend this pill!!,F,25,4  months,1/8/2007,Ortho cyclen-21
183, 1, For period regulation and PMS,I switched to Ortho Cyclen from Ortho Tri Cyclen right before i went to college.  I had really weird emotions these past three months_ i would be sad and the really happy.  i also gained too much weight: 10-15lbs!  This has really hurt me and my relationships with others.  Please do not go on this for period regulation.,Maybe this is just the side effects for younger woman_ but it is scary how much it changes you.  I have been off it for a week and already lost 5 pounds.  Good luck_ and hope you find the right pill.,F,18,3  days,12/12/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
184, 5, Birth Control,Nausea first couple of months,Very effective_ even when I've missed a dose or two.  Bigger breasts.,F,33,12  years,12/10/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
185, 3, heavy bleeding/anemia,i was taken off ortho-tricyclen lo and put onto sprintec (ortho cyclen generic) a few months ago because i had severe blood loss and had become anemic. the first 2 months i had no break through bleeding really_ but my facial acne was awful. i finally decided to go tanning and that pretty much cleared it up thankfully. im on my third pack and lately i have noticed some break through bleeding_ i also take 324 mg of iron and 3 ibuprofin 3 times a day to prevent this...i really hope it doesnt get any worse. also_ i have noticed that occasionally i have a foul vaginal odor which seems to go away if i just shower really well but showering twice a day is a little annoying. i have gained 10 pounds since i have started the pill and my breasts seem twice the size they were before i started the pill. luckily for me the weight seems to have gone to my chest and hips_ which i dont mind too much because i am very thin.,this pill seems ok so far but i am hoping the break through bleeding will clear up,F,17,3  months,11/23/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
186, 1, birth control,I've had horrible mood swings since I've been on this drug.  I was previously taking Yasmin_ but switched because of the cost.  I will definitely be switching back to Yasmin.,,F,39,2  weeks,11/10/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
187, 5, no babies!,"I started at 16..no problems.. everythings been great. Im 27 now and stopped for 2 months now because I would like to have a baby and I can not explain in words how much pain I am experiencing now. I cant walk some days_ and I dread my ""friend"" coming... Can some one please let me know if they have experienced this... Everything was fine till I stopped.Is this how the manufacturer wants us to keep taking this drug_ by forcing women to keep taking it?",,F,27,11  years,11/7/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
188, 5, no babies,,"Sorry forgot to add.....Also I noticed ""lesions"" on my feet... dermatologist said it was my immune system reacting in my body to the pill's ingredients... anyone else experience this?",F,27,11  years,11/7/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
189, 3, Birth Control,10 lb. weight gain_ minor acne_ chest tightness_ mood swings_ anxiety_ and some paranoia (mostly about my relationship with my boyfriend_ with constant dreams/thoughts that he was going to leave me or cheat on me).,,F,19,1  months,10/15/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
190, 4, contraception,I started taking the pill at 19 with no problems.  I continued on it and still had no issues until I was about 22.  I started noticing spotting a week before my period in times of increased stress.  Shortly after that the pharmacy gave me sprintec instead of the regular ortho.  I just noticed the correlation with my bad PMS the last two years and  switching to sprintec.,It was great the first few years.  I don't know if the switch to sprintec had made my PMS  unbearable_ or the changes and stress in my life.  But since I've been using sprintec_ my PMS is bad.  I cry_ have anxiety_ get moody and depressed_ and still have the break through the week before.  I used to never have bad PMS at all.  I'm thinking of going back to Ortho Cyclen and not the generic.,F,25,6  years,9/27/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
191, 2, contraception,Menstrual Migraines!!!  Weight gain! Ugh,My doc. switched me to ortho cyclen from Loestrin to help with break thru bleeding...I think I just should have stuck it out with the Loestrin a little longer.,F,26,16  months,9/23/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
192, 4, Contraceptive,Heavy spotting three weeks in_ enlarged breasts_ minor weight gain (5 lbs) and minor facial acne.,I was on Yasmin for 30 days and_ although it works great for many_ I bled moderately 25 out of the 30 days as it has a very low estrogen level. Once I switched_ that subsided but facial acne_ bigger boobs & spotting began again 3 weeks in.,F,30,26  days,9/20/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
193, 3, No babies,I have been having mood swings like crazy. One minute I am happy the next I am crying or yelling about something. Other than that it's been an alright pill_ but I am glad that I am off it.,It's defiently been hard on my family lately.,F,21,1  years,9/20/2006Email,Ortho cyclen-21
194, 4, birth control,No side effects_worked well_ had minimal cramping and periods came at the same time every month. NO weight gain_ minimal hairloss _ no increase in breast size,,F,19,3  years,7/14/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
195, 5, irregular periods,Very light cramps on first day of period and during the 11th year depression (but not prior).,Ortho worked well with my body's chemistry.  It regulated and shortened my periods_ got rid of the bad cramps and nausea_ and lightened my once heavy period.  I never had weight gain_ loss of sex drive or moodiness.   I would have loved to have remained on this birth control_ but the doctor said that after a while you body can react differently to the hormones_ and that probably caused the depression.  I stopped birth control all together and after 2 months the depression was entirely gone.  I am now on the Nuvaring_ which may be the cause of my recent hairloss and weight gain. I wish I could go back.,F,26,11  years,7/8/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
196, 2, preventative care,My face broke out_ sex drive dropped to zero.. this pill is a relationship ruiner.,I was on Ortho Cyclen from age 15-19 on and off.  Each time I would get on the pill_ my sex drive would drop completely.  I was on Yasmin which I highly recomment but went back on Ortho-cycle due to price.,F,21,4  years,7/7/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
197, 4, birth control,fluid retention_ possible weight gain_ long heavy periods (7days)_ a lot of discharge_ HIGH sex drive.,I just switched to Alesse after taking this for about 8 years. On ortho cyclen I had a VERY high sex drive_ had a lot of discharge_ but I also seemed sluggish and had really long periods_ perhaps from the added estrogen. Alesse has shortened my periods in just one month on it_ but now my sex drive is ZERO! Go figure,F,24,8  years,4/13/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
198, 1, birth control/ regualte periods,i was on the generic form called sprintec.  the side effects included excess discharge and chronic yeast infections_ very bad acne_ depression_ mood swings.  it helped my hair loss but it ruined my skin!  i always had perfect skin and now i am covered in blotches and scars.  the discharge and yeast infections were embarrassing.  my sex drive was fine but i hardly was ever able to have sex because of the bad odor and excessive discharge. i wasnt able to get out of bed and found myself constantly starting fights with my boyfriend.,your doctor will constantly tell you that it's not the pill that causes these effects_ but it is.  now i have ruined skin and thinning hair---thanks doctor!,F,24,2  years,3/13/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
199, 4, Contraseption,Practically none. After few years i've began having light bleeding a week before finishing the pill cycle.,No side effects for me - no weight gain_ no acne_ period didn't shorten_ breasts didn't grow. Absolutely nothing!,F,27,5  years,2/22/2006,Ortho cyclen-21
200, 2, ,Headaches!,,F,31,2  months,2/24/2005,Ortho cyclen-21
201, 4, Doctor Prescribed.,None that I can qualify as scientific_ but maybe loss of libido and more dryness down there.,Didn't gain weight. Breasts didn't change. Acne is less of a problem but maybe it's because I am getting older.,F,25,1  years,2/11/2005,Ortho cyclen-21
202, 5, awesome,its great,great,F,66,14  times,12/14/2004,Ortho cyclen-21
203, 3, Polycycstic Ovarian Syndrome,I've gained weight every month on this medication.  I cannot loose any of it.  My body acne cleared up_ but Ortho Cyclen made my facial acne worse than I've ever experienced.  My breasts are constantly getting bigger on this.  So far I've gone from a C to an E_ with no end in sight.  In the first couple months I had bad nausea and brake-through bleeding.,It did a great job clearing up my dozens of ovarian cycsts without any scarring.  It also binded my extra serum testosterone_ stopping my development of excess body hair.  Since the testosterone and cycsts have cleared up_ I've had ever worsening side effects (weight gain_ breast enlargement_ acne).  I'm hoping to switch pills for my next cycle to something with less than 35 mcg estrogen.,F,23,21  months,10/15/2004,Ortho cyclen-21
