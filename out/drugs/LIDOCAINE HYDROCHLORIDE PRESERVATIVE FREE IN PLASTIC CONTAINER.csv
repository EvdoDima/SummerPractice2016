0, 5, 20% Lidocaine Sub Q Injectable,I take 20% Lidocaine Sub-q Injections for the burning for RSD Pain. Mexilitine_ the oral pill does nothing for me. Have found out the dose I take has to be compounded at a pharmacy that compounds meds and most pain physicians are hesitant to prescribe it due to two very bad side effects if not careful_ and they are it can cause seizures or your heart to stop of you inject into a vein or even near a capillary.,It is a wonder drug for my burning pain. Will be on it ten years this coming April and although I have to pay for it_ I wouldn't stop it for anything. It_ used with my oral pain meds_ acts like an adjunct and within 30 minutes_ my pain drops from a 10+ to a tolerable 3-4 level before it's climb begins in about three hours.,F,59,10  years,2/5/2006Email,Lidocaine hydrochloride preservative free in plastic container
