0, 1, For high blood pressure Indapamide,"My body began to weaken over a 6-day when I began to dry heave_ then regurgitate in the evening of the 6th day. Went to Doctor on 7th day when he told me to discontinue use. Went home where I fainted_ then ""ambulanced"" to ICU at hospital. Stayed for 4-days to IV sodium/potassium level from ""104""to normal""135-145"". I thought I was a goner. Learn from my ugly experience.","They don't make ""lozol"" but they make the generic ""indapamide"". Still being prescribed. Beware.",M,67,7  days2.5mg,8/25/2015Email,Lozol

5, 5, Hypertension  approx. 130/100,None.  Great diuretic.,I have taken Lozol (indapamide) 1.25mg since 1994. At one time it had reduced my BP to 120/72.  Perfect!  Now my BP has creeped back up.  I've tried other meds (Lisinopril_ Diovan) in addition to the Lozol_ but have had trouble with side effects.  Now I'm working on diet_ vitamins_ minerals (Mg & potassium)_ and sleep to bring down borderline BP.,F,43,14  years,10/20/2008Email,Lozol
6, 1, High Blood Pressure,Nausea_ dizziness_ tinnitus_ insomnia_ agitation_ anxiety_ thirst_ flu-like symptoms_ dehydration_ confusion_ depression_ flushing_ rash_ swelling_ night-sweats.,I have taken this drug on and off for the last two years as a supplement to ACE treatment for high blood pressure and it really is a nasty add-on.  Everytime my doctor convinces me to try it again I wonder why I have agreed.  My view is only consider this drug as a last resort - it's not a good diuretic_ it's not a good antihypertensive - it's just cheap and nasty.,M,30,2  years,8/22/2008,Lozol
7, 1, High blood pressure,dehydration_ personality change_ anxiety_ reduced kidney function,This drug caused me to be so dehyrated that my eyes and mouth were always dry no matter how much I drank liquids. I noticed that I would become easily upset and angry. My blood tests showed that it lowered my kidney function. I was also taking Toprol and Cozaar. The combination of drugs seem to have caused permanent kidney damage.,F,64,2  years,1/9/2008,Lozol
