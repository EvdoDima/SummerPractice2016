0, 4, Hyperhidrosis,Severe dry mouth (I take the 1 mg capsules_ usually my dose is 2 but it depends on the temperaute and what I'm doing)_ sore throat_ dry eyes_ hard to breathe if I take it at night_ and dry hands that swell in the heat if I walk and have them swinging at my sides.,I wasn't sure whether to rate this 3 or 4 and finally decided on four. It's a good medicine if you are able to hydrate yourself (drink fluids) daily so your throat and mouth stay nice and moist and your voice doesn't get all scratchy or crack. I guess it doesn't help that I have bad anxiety issues_ so the fact that this messes with my voice brings a lot of negativity my way. Also_ I do sweat an awful lot_ mostly my back and under my arms (fixed most of that with Botox injections) so I have to take a high dose for it to work the way I want it to.,F,17,2  years,9/6/2007,Glycopyrrolate
