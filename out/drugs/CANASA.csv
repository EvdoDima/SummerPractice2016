0, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,decrease in swelling and pain,Canasa reduced the swelling quite a bit and took the edge off of the pain. It is expensive_ and my insurance will only cover 1 1000 mg rectal suppository per day even though the Rx is for 2/day.,F,55,1  years1000 mg 1X D,6/23/2016Email,Canasa
1, 4, collitis / proctitis,The combination of Canasa and Colazal have made a long term condition much better.,My only gripe is that this medicine is so darned expensive_ and not available as a generic.,M,65,5  years1000mg 1X D,2/3/2012,Canasa
2, 1, Severe UC,Severe joint pain to the point I was not able to walk,My doctor claimed my joint pain was from UC_ but I had no sign of joint pain until taking this medication. When I went off_ it took several days for the pain to go down. I went on it again for a few days because of a flare up and the joint pain came right back. After a few weeks the pain hasn't totally gone away. The first time I took it it helped my rectal pain dramatically within 2 days. The second time it didn't do a thing. Side effects aren't worth it nor the high price tag! I've seen significant improvement from a cooked veggie diet_ ultrainflamx_ probiotics_ roberts formula_ psyllium_ turmeric_ boswellia_ fish oil_ glutamine_ sodium butyrate enemas. Highly recommend a naturopath!,F,25,13  days1000 1X D,10/7/2010Email,Canasa
3, 1, cuffitis,Anal Pain_ Diarreah_ Increased Gas_ Body aches in legs_ Low grade fever_ Insomnia_ Dizziness_ and Low Energy level,Currently have a J-pouch and was prescribed canasa to relive the severe inflamation I have due to UC affecting the stump of rectum that was left after surgery.  Seemed like it helped after I stoped the medication by making my stool go from watery to spongy.  However the side effects were too much for my body.,M,34,10  days1000mg 1X D,8/3/2010,Canasa
