11, 1, Prevent pregnancy,I gained about 20-30lbs and had trouble losing the weight even with diet and exercise. I have a history of  migraines_ while on the implanon I had  multiple headaches that lasted 2-3 days. Many close friends and family said my mood changed. The only reason I stuck with it for the 3 years was because my insurance wouldn't pay the full amount and my  premium was high to have it removed before the three years was up. Never again...

I would get a period every other month or so now I don't get a period at all.  I've been very emotional and have been very tired. I wake up sad and would much rather stay in bed. I get very frustrated easily and my sex drive has dropped. On top of all that I've gained so much weight_ I feel really uncomfortable with myself.

20, 1, Heavy periods_ prevent pregnancy,I don't have a clue why I kept it in so long. My mother told me that it was the reason for all of my current problems for years now and I just ignored her and stuck up for this stupid thing. After it was put in_(huge mistake)I began my slow progress to crazytown. I was on medications for the herniated disks in my back and I didn't have a addictive personality. But I started being mentally dependent on my meds that i had been taking for years....I was sent to a rehab/mental hospital for opiate abuse and constant suicide attempts. Ive become an addict :( The amount of meds I have been on in the last year are just crazy!! Depression_ bi polar_ borderline personality disorder_ PTSD_ and all of a sudden after 2 years was supposedly depressed after having my 4 year old. How is that even possible?!?! I have become a horrible mother and wife. My husband hates me. And I swear the way he eats is enough to make me want to strangle him. We've been married for 6 years and now we are in marriage counseling and our sex life is nonexistent. I hate sex now and it's like a chore. When before we were so in love and my sex drive was super high. Me & my husband threaten divorce every day. I'm always tired & my back pain is through the roof. I am always on my period. My boobs are tender & I hate being touched in anyway. I am confused all of the time & the psych meds just turn me into a zombie-shell of my former self.,IT SHOULD BE BANDED,F,25,3  years,6/13/2015Email,Implanon
21, 1, Heavy periods_ prevent pregnancy,Third part to my story. I feel like a completely different person with no life goals & no future. I want this thing out of my arm NOWWW. I was never this person before & well now I am a complete mess. I thought for the longest time that this was all me and that I was just a horrible person. Also I have had all of my lower molars removed after getting this thing put in. I lost 100 lbs in 2 months before I got it by working my ass off. Went from 240lbs to 140lbs. Now I am 165lbs. And I work out so much but nothing seems to shake the weight.,,F,25,3  years,6/13/2015Email,Implanon
22, 1, Heavy periods_ prevent pregnancy,Sorry this the other half of my story since its so long. I hate myself & my life & I have become very much indeed okay with the idea of dying unfortunately..I try so hard to be better & productive but I honestly don't want to. I had a grand Mal seizure recently & 3 months ago I left my house on foot w/nothing but my phone & my inhaler. I was missing for 4 days_ when I was found_ I was in a completely different state. after my hubby put a missing persons report out for me. A full out man search went down btw. i was in such a bad state of psychosis_(from what? I have no freaken clue) i fought police officers & hospital people. They locked me in a mental ward for 4 days w/o any memory of what had happened. I almost lost my freedom & was told I was criminally insane. Now I am having constant headaches & fevers. Vison problems & double vison when I drive. None of this makes any sense...I have an amazing life!!! Brand new house_ two 40k dollar cars and a motorcycle. My daughter is 4 & brilliant_ she can read at a 3rd grade level & can operate any electronic device. My hubby takes care of all of the bills & we live very comfortably. I don't work & I don't feel comfortable in my body. Also I am so antisocial now...I literally hate people & think about suicide atleast twice a day. What the hell is happening to me..,,F,25,3  years,6/13/2015Email,Implanon
23, 3, history of heavy period and pain,Dry mouth_ 1 week of vaginal dryness and mildly achey arm.,I decided on implanon because my periods were so painful I couldnt walk around without a hot water bottle pressed to my stomach and had constant chunks bigger than sandwich pickles. For a week_ sometimes two I would be house and bed ridden which was effecting my working life. I have had a dry mouth since a couple of days after the implant and the first week I did have some dryness downstairs but I added extra things like nuts to my regular diet to promote vitamin E and oils to my skin and body. With the extreme bleeding side effects I think anyone who gets implanon just so they don't forget the pill and complains is just ridiculous. With all the complications you need to be aware of what you are gambling. I had 4 periods in 6 weeks previous to getting the implant put in so I felt like I had nothing to lose by gambling on the hopes that implanon would maybe fix or regulate my already wacky and heavy painful cycle. There are plenty of other forms of contraception for those who cannot deal with the idea that it effects everyone differently and you don't just get what you want from it. It's not a present its a means to an end for those who are willing to risk the chance of those side effects.,F,23,3  weeks,5/28/2015,Implanon
24, 1, To prevent pregnancy,weight gain. Mood swings_ irrational anger.,It's awful! I've put on 36 lbs! My fiance? and I just moved and we've really been trying to get in shape and I can't lose a single pound! No matter what I do the scale won't change! It's so discouraging. My engagement almost ended because everything sets me off. My moodswings make me bipolar!  I was fine before I got it in my arm. WORST PRODUCT EVER! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone !,F,20,4  days,5/10/2015,Implanon
25, 3, birth control,I really liked the implanon at first. After about a month of having it i started to get mood swings. My mood swings and my emotions were terrible and still are. I also have periods that last months at a time.,,F,18,3  years68 MG,5/4/2015Email,Implanon
26, 4, Birth control,Nausea_ headaches_ and very mild cramping.,I've only had the implant for a week but so far it's been good. I hate the nausea but it's not that severe or that often. The doctor told me not to carry anything over 10 pounds for a while and I wish I would've listened. Nothing happened except my arm felt VERY weak after carrying my 4 year old nephew. As far as the insertion process_ it wasn't so bad. The numbing medication stung like a bee sort of. But after that you don't feel anything. Just some soreness after the numbing medication wears off. The doctor told me to leave the pressure bandage for at least 24hrs to avoid bruising and I did. But the bandaid they put underneath was so small that when I took off the pressure bandage the small bandaid was drenched in blood. I replaced it with one of the big band aids because the insertion site hadn't healed yet. I showered with it and everything. And then after the shower Id replace it again. I only did this twice because the band aids were causing terrible itching. It did hurt when I took it off because it was the one I put after my shower and it was still very sticky. But after reading about girls who got blisters around the area because of the band aids I decided to take it off. It didn't seem to do anything to the implant and the insertion site had already formed a scab so it seems okay. I like this bc so far no major problems :),F,20,1  weeks,5/2/2015Email,Implanon
27, 1, To lessen periods,This is a deceiving horrible piece of s**t. Previous to getting this I had painful periods with mood swings to the point you'd think I had split personality_ got the implant after being told it would stop this due to the steady release of hormones. Yes for a year I was period free and then f*****g Jesus Christ I get 7 periods in the space of 11 weeks how the hell is anyone supposed to live with that constantly not knowing when the next one could come_ it was some sort of sick joke. I would not recommend this to anyone who ever wants to wear white jeans again/leave the house.,,F,21,2  years68,4/29/2015,Implanon
28, 1, to prevent pregnancy,6 months of bleeding nonstop!!!! I would not recommend this birth control to anyone!!! I was so excited when I first heard about an implant that is good for 3 years. It was so exciting to me that I wouldnt need to remember taking a pill for an entire 3 years. This was the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.,4 Days after I got the implant the bleeding started. I was told by my doctor that it would subside and to give it time... I waited for 6 entire months bleeding everyday before I got fed up and got it removed. and yes... by 6 months of bleeding i really mean 6 entire months of bleeding. Not one day of being free. No girl in her right mind wants to go through that. It is very rough emotionally because of the pure frustration that it wont stop and also it added stress on my relationship because it gets in the way of my sex life. I got this implant for birth control and all it did was block my entire sex life!!  Now that it is out i got back on the pill i was on in highschool. I have been on it for a month and Im still bleeding from that stupid implant. I really feel like it messed my body up and I dont know when the bleeding will stop and I cant stand it!!!!! Everytime I go to the doctor they dont have much to say and act like its no big deal... If i could make my decision all over again I would NEVER have chosen Implanon!!!!!!,F,24,6  months 1X D,4/21/2015,Implanon
29, 4, I was in an active relationship,For the first month I had about a 3 week long period. Then I got my period every 4 months for the first year_ then one period the next year and this last year and a half I haven't had my period at all.,Having the implant for 3 years has been a better form of contraceptive rather than the pill_ which I tried before but started forgetting. The implant never made me gain weight. I believe having it from ages 16-19 has had a big impact on puberty and growth with natural hormones_ meaning my body missed that time frame and didn't have any growth. I get it removed on Tuesday April 14th.,F,19,3  years,4/12/2015,Implanon

31, 1, Prevent unplanned pregnancy,Heavy constant bleeding_ uterine polyps and headaches,Do not get it!... I had a constant period for 3 months straight with headaches. I went to my family doctor who put it in and they took it out and sent me to the gynecologist. They found uterine polyps and told me I can have them removed and run the risk of them coming back_ or have them removed along with an ablation. In fear of them coming back_ I had the ablation....now I can't have any more kids.,F,30,3  months 1X D,3/30/2015,Implanon
32, 3, Prevent second pregnancy,I had the implanon put in after I gave birth in 2011 and on the plus side it prevented me from getting pregnant and I had zero periods when I had it. But that's also the downfall_ I thought it was great not having any periods while on it and when it came time to take it out I still wasn't getting any. About a month after it came out I was getting light brown periods that either lasted a few days or over a week_ and then I stopped having then altogether. I went on the pill to try and regulate and it worked for a little bit and then I just stopped getting them again. I had irregular periods growing up_ but never like this. My husband and I had been trying to get pregnant since late 2013 and have had no luck_ and it's really hard to know when you don't get a period.,It helped with not getting pregnant_ but totally screwed up my cycle,F,25,2  years,3/23/2015Email,Implanon

35, 1, birth control,I've had IMPLANON when I was 16-19. I never had a problem. I had my son after I turned 21. I decided to get the birth control again. Biggest mistake. I've been bleeding for 23 days straight now. It's not old blood its new. It acts like its going to stop then starts up the same day back to bright red. I've got headaches_body aches_ severe cramping_ bloating....the list goes on. I would much rather be pregnant at this point. It's definitely doing its job...no baby and practicing abstinence...its so frustrating. I would not advise anyone to get this birth control. I'm trying to get my OB to take it out of my arm.

37, 1, to prevent unwanted pregnancies,I hate implanon its the worst ever! I have mine in for four months now n for the first three months everything was fine just irregular bleeding....but as soon as I reached the forth month all went crazy. I started experiencing severe depression and anxiety which I never felt before; I had an instance when I nearly passed out and my forehead was wet because of the sudden sweating. I would feel angry n cry for nothing or find something. I even felt confused n like I'm just not myself. I made an appointment n I'm having it taken out. My arm pains on the area as well as my left leg and hand. I'm just really upset that medical PROFESSIONALS does not inform people about these side effects before hand. And many women complain about them refusing to remove the implant until up to 1 year. I  was told to wait till six months but I thought there's not a chance after all I read and heard. Its your choice as u no your body.would just be super of people can respect that! Anyway I no everyone is different so maybe the implant is good for some people but not me n I would not ever recommend it to anyone.it should be BANDED,,F,23,4  months,3/2/2015Email,Implanon

I wouldn't reccommend it to my worst enemy...  The first week was ok I thought my life was going to be great_ I don't have to think about taking the pill daily or having to go back to the injection. Which were also terrible experiences but I would trade the implanon any day. The second week OMG I cried everyday for hours. This was the type of crying where I wanted my life to end.. And then when I question why I was crying I had no reason then I would cry because I was angry for crying for no reason.. I would cry on a packed train. A packed bus Nd just start screaming and crying in my bedroom..  After a week I felt so good all off a sudden_ for like 3 days. I would dance into work_ make everyone laugh. Then all of a sudden I would want to just run to an island where no one exists. I started hating my boyfriend and would start arguments with him for things he did years ago_ we are currently on a break due to me not wanting to know anyone anymore. My sex drive went so low that I'm sure it's in hell somewhere_ I got abit so a sex drive when I had a lot of drink in me because it helped me more active. But when I'm at home I just want to lay down and never get up_ and when I do have sex it HURTS like crazy. It is such a painful experience. In the last 3 months we've had sex like 3 times but before we used to have sex every time we saw each other which was about four times a week.

42, 3, Prevent pregnancy,Almost constant bleeding 30 pounds of weight gain mood swings,I have had this in now for 2 and a half years and I just want it out. It works really well in terms of preventing pregnancy but the bleeding is unbearable. I never know when it will start or stop. Some months I'll be bleeding on and off for 3 weeks of the month. I have tried to eat healthy and exercise but I keep gaining weight. I'm going to have it removed very soon mainly due to the bleeding. I could handle irregular periods_ but this is a common thing now to be bleeding for a week then it will stop for five day and start all over again.

Although I haven't had my period since getting the implanon_ it's still not worth it. I'm having it removed next week.,The doctor who implanted it raved about how it doesn't cause weight gain and how few side effects it has. That's why I got it. I just recently went to another doctor with my concerns and she laughed! She said that the doctor who implanted it must not know very much about it because the top 2 reasons people have come to her to have it removed has been of the weight gain and depression!,F,29,4  months 1X D,2/8/2015,Implanon

47, 3, to prevent second pregnancy,When I first received the implanon I just got off the depo because of the complications that came with that I believed that implanon would be a better plan soon as I started the implanon I began bleeding immediately for months and would only stop for a week then start back up it was soooooo bad I couldn't take it anymore but I was only 3 1/2 months in my doc persuaded me to go on for at least 6 mnths before I got it tooken out so I made a apt to see what could help the bleeding stop they decided to put me on the pill for 3weeks then after I bleed for a few days now I have completely stopped bleeding I'm guessing my body had to get use to it I'm going on 6 months now and I recently got really bad cramps as if I was going get a period I spotted for like an hour then it went away I'm kinda lost on that one. But so far things have been going better.,,F,21,5  months,1/24/2015,Implanon
48, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Weight gain_ acne_ mood swings_ cramps_ bloating_ headaches continually bleeding and depression,Before I got the implanting my doctor never told me about all the side effects_ only irregular periods. I never realized how bad it's gotten until now. I've been having pregnacy symptoms_ can't control my moods_ never understood why_ my face breaks out every week and I thought it was just me because I didn't know about the side effects_ it is great not getting me pregnant but I bleed for MONTHS will stop for about a week but it always came back and barely stopped couldn't have good sec with my husband I've gained about 35 pounds and can NOT loose it I've always been active and always been moving but now I'm finally understanding why after the 3 years I feel terrible I thought it was something within me but its not I'm making my appt in the A.M! I would suggest women to try it to prevent pregnancy because not all have the side effects but it is very rare that they don't,F,19,3  years70,1/23/2015Email,Implanon
49, 4, prevent pregnancy,Bled for a month when first  got it. Little bit of weight gain. Have not had a period since except light spotting the other day and today i am extremely  bloated which i have never had in my life. All in all it works for me.,,F,23,1  yearsnot sure,1/19/2015Email,Implanon
50, 1, Prevent pregnancy,It's amazing how such a small thing can make such a huge impact on somebody's life! My mood swings are probably one of the two biggest problems along with me never being able to stop bleeding unless I take the combined pill? Which again makes me more moody_ and when I say moody_ I mean MOODY I tend to snap at everything anybody says which had ruined a few relationships with people I care about. I also have a terrible time sleeping_ I can be so so tired but my body just won't go to sleep and I will be tossing and turning all night or I can be not tired at all and my body just seems to fall asleep when it has the chance_ this has effected work and my social life! I also eat a lot at unnecessary times such as 11:00 pm - 12:00 am. I had also had a phantom pregnancy which was pretty scary but at least I got to stop bleeding for a couple weeks! Wow one word to anyone who is thinking about getting one_ DONT! The only reason I haven't got it out is because I'm scared of the method the get it out ha!,dont make my mistake.,F,16,1  years,1/19/2015Email,Implanon
51, 3, Birth control,Weight gain. I never had my period on it.,After getting it removed my body change_ I was feeling sick daily. Vagnial discomfort. Irregular periods if I wasn't trying to conceive I would put it back for the pure reason it agreed with my body.,F,20,3  years,1/18/2015,Implanon

56, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,I have to say that this thing has changed my entire life but not for the best. It has effected seriously everything.  I don't have motivation to do ANYTHING. I am nauseous all the time_ that also comes along with a huge headache. It had also had an impact on my sleeping_ I either do it all the time or not at all same with eating.  I haven't even gotten to the emotional kick of this. I am insanely moody_ just to give an example I bawled my eyes out over french fries. My periods are about 4-8 weeks long_ no sign I'm about to start other than bad acne and huge mood swings. They aren't regular at all but I have never been regular since I started having my periods. This has different symptoms for ever woman but I can say I wish I never got this thing put in my arm.,,F,20,4  months,1/8/2015,Implanon
57, 1, doctor recommendation.,No menstural cycle the entire 3 years_ besides spotting_ extreme mood swings_ pregnancy symptoms_3 misscarriages_ headaches_ arm pain_ chest pain_ hot flashes_ joint pain. Weight gain 50 lbs +,The worst mistake of my life.  It wasn't for me.  Plus cost a fortune to have removed.,F,22,3  years68mg,1/8/2015Email,Implanon
58, 5, for birth control,I have had no weight gain not even the estimated 6 pounds which is surprising I'm over weight to begin with was very hungry all the tire for the first two weeks gave into the cravings but still no weight gain I was very moody after having my sin even three months after got the implanon and felt normal again. No loss of sex drive head aches nothing really bad to say except the occasional pain in my arm when I move it a certain that at but that went away about a month ago great birth control so far oh and no periods,It's not for everyone and you can complain if you get side effects all birth controls have some sort of side effect so does all medicine. Talk to you doctor and see if its for you first and ask about the weight gain the moodiness and everything else before making the decision if you don't like it remove it simple as that but don't wait till things get bad.,F,19,2  months,1/1/2015,Implanon
59, 4, Birth control,For the first three months_ it was constant spotting and I was highly angry all the time_ nearly at breaking point and constantly being mad at my boyfriend of 2 years so much so_ that he wanted me to remove it so I was back to my old self. I've gained weight_ about 2 stone and I just can't shift it but I haven't had a period since that third month and my anger has calmed down so if you can cope with the first bit_ then it's perfect.,,F,17,8  months,1/1/2015,Implanon
