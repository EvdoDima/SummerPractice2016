11, 1, Prevent pregnancy,I gained about 20-30lbs and had trouble losing the weight even with diet and exercise. I have a history of  migraines_ while on the implanon I had  multiple headaches that lasted 2-3 days. Many close friends and family said my mood changed. The only reason I stuck with it for the 3 years was because my insurance wouldn't pay the full amount and my  premium was high to have it removed before the three years was up. Never again...

I would get a period every other month or so now I don't get a period at all.  I've been very emotional and have been very tired. I wake up sad and would much rather stay in bed. I get very frustrated easily and my sex drive has dropped. On top of all that I've gained so much weight_ I feel really uncomfortable with myself.

20, 1, Heavy periods_ prevent pregnancy,I don't have a clue why I kept it in so long. My mother told me that it was the reason for all of my current problems for years now and I just ignored her and stuck up for this stupid thing. After it was put in_(huge mistake)I began my slow progress to crazytown. I was on medications for the herniated disks in my back and I didn't have a addictive personality. But I started being mentally dependent on my meds that i had been taking for years....I was sent to a rehab/mental hospital for opiate abuse and constant suicide attempts. Ive become an addict :( The amount of meds I have been on in the last year are just crazy!! Depression_ bi polar_ borderline personality disorder_ PTSD_ and all of a sudden after 2 years was supposedly depressed after having my 4 year old. How is that even possible?!?! I have become a horrible mother and wife. My husband hates me. And I swear the way he eats is enough to make me want to strangle him. We've been married for 6 years and now we are in marriage counseling and our sex life is nonexistent. I hate sex now and it's like a chore. When before we were so in love and my sex drive was super high. Me & my husband threaten divorce every day. I'm always tired & my back pain is through the roof. I am always on my period. My boobs are tender & I hate being touched in anyway. I am confused all of the time & the psych meds just turn me into a zombie-shell of my former self.,IT SHOULD BE BANDED,F,25,3  years,6/13/2015Email,Implanon
21, 1, Heavy periods_ prevent pregnancy,Third part to my story. I feel like a completely different person with no life goals & no future. I want this thing out of my arm NOWWW. I was never this person before & well now I am a complete mess. I thought for the longest time that this was all me and that I was just a horrible person. Also I have had all of my lower molars removed after getting this thing put in. I lost 100 lbs in 2 months before I got it by working my ass off. Went from 240lbs to 140lbs. Now I am 165lbs. And I work out so much but nothing seems to shake the weight.,,F,25,3  years,6/13/2015Email,Implanon
22, 1, Heavy periods_ prevent pregnancy,Sorry this the other half of my story since its so long. I hate myself & my life & I have become very much indeed okay with the idea of dying unfortunately..I try so hard to be better & productive but I honestly don't want to. I had a grand Mal seizure recently & 3 months ago I left my house on foot w/nothing but my phone & my inhaler. I was missing for 4 days_ when I was found_ I was in a completely different state. after my hubby put a missing persons report out for me. A full out man search went down btw. i was in such a bad state of psychosis_(from what? I have no freaken clue) i fought police officers & hospital people. They locked me in a mental ward for 4 days w/o any memory of what had happened. I almost lost my freedom & was told I was criminally insane. Now I am having constant headaches & fevers. Vison problems & double vison when I drive. None of this makes any sense...I have an amazing life!!! Brand new house_ two 40k dollar cars and a motorcycle. My daughter is 4 & brilliant_ she can read at a 3rd grade level & can operate any electronic device. My hubby takes care of all of the bills & we live very comfortably. I don't work & I don't feel comfortable in my body. Also I am so antisocial now...I literally hate people & think about suicide atleast twice a day. What the hell is happening to me..,,F,25,3  years,6/13/2015Email,Implanon
23, 3, history of heavy period and pain,Dry mouth_ 1 week of vaginal dryness and mildly achey arm.,I decided on implanon because my periods were so painful I couldnt walk around without a hot water bottle pressed to my stomach and had constant chunks bigger than sandwich pickles. For a week_ sometimes two I would be house and bed ridden which was effecting my working life. I have had a dry mouth since a couple of days after the implant and the first week I did have some dryness downstairs but I added extra things like nuts to my regular diet to promote vitamin E and oils to my skin and body. With the extreme bleeding side effects I think anyone who gets implanon just so they don't forget the pill and complains is just ridiculous. With all the complications you need to be aware of what you are gambling. I had 4 periods in 6 weeks previous to getting the implant put in so I felt like I had nothing to lose by gambling on the hopes that implanon would maybe fix or regulate my already wacky and heavy painful cycle. There are plenty of other forms of contraception for those who cannot deal with the idea that it effects everyone differently and you don't just get what you want from it. It's not a present its a means to an end for those who are willing to risk the chance of those side effects.,F,23,3  weeks,5/28/2015,Implanon
24, 1, To prevent pregnancy,weight gain. Mood swings_ irrational anger.,It's awful! I've put on 36 lbs! My fiancé and I just moved and we've really been trying to get in shape and I can't lose a single pound! No matter what I do the scale won't change! It's so discouraging. My engagement almost ended because everything sets me off. My moodswings make me bipolar!  I was fine before I got it in my arm. WORST PRODUCT EVER! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone !,F,20,4  days,5/10/2015,Implanon
25, 3, birth control,I really liked the implanon at first. After about a month of having it i started to get mood swings. My mood swings and my emotions were terrible and still are. I also have periods that last months at a time.,,F,18,3  years68 MG,5/4/2015Email,Implanon
26, 4, Birth control,Nausea_ headaches_ and very mild cramping.,I've only had the implant for a week but so far it's been good. I hate the nausea but it's not that severe or that often. The doctor told me not to carry anything over 10 pounds for a while and I wish I would've listened. Nothing happened except my arm felt VERY weak after carrying my 4 year old nephew. As far as the insertion process_ it wasn't so bad. The numbing medication stung like a bee sort of. But after that you don't feel anything. Just some soreness after the numbing medication wears off. The doctor told me to leave the pressure bandage for at least 24hrs to avoid bruising and I did. But the bandaid they put underneath was so small that when I took off the pressure bandage the small bandaid was drenched in blood. I replaced it with one of the big band aids because the insertion site hadn't healed yet. I showered with it and everything. And then after the shower Id replace it again. I only did this twice because the band aids were causing terrible itching. It did hurt when I took it off because it was the one I put after my shower and it was still very sticky. But after reading about girls who got blisters around the area because of the band aids I decided to take it off. It didn't seem to do anything to the implant and the insertion site had already formed a scab so it seems okay. I like this bc so far no major problems :),F,20,1  weeks,5/2/2015Email,Implanon
27, 1, To lessen periods,This is a deceiving horrible piece of s**t. Previous to getting this I had painful periods with mood swings to the point you'd think I had split personality_ got the implant after being told it would stop this due to the steady release of hormones. Yes for a year I was period free and then f*****g Jesus Christ I get 7 periods in the space of 11 weeks how the hell is anyone supposed to live with that constantly not knowing when the next one could come_ it was some sort of sick joke. I would not recommend this to anyone who ever wants to wear white jeans again/leave the house.,,F,21,2  years68,4/29/2015,Implanon
28, 1, to prevent pregnancy,6 months of bleeding nonstop!!!! I would not recommend this birth control to anyone!!! I was so excited when I first heard about an implant that is good for 3 years. It was so exciting to me that I wouldnt need to remember taking a pill for an entire 3 years. This was the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.,4 Days after I got the implant the bleeding started. I was told by my doctor that it would subside and to give it time... I waited for 6 entire months bleeding everyday before I got fed up and got it removed. and yes... by 6 months of bleeding i really mean 6 entire months of bleeding. Not one day of being free. No girl in her right mind wants to go through that. It is very rough emotionally because of the pure frustration that it wont stop and also it added stress on my relationship because it gets in the way of my sex life. I got this implant for birth control and all it did was block my entire sex life!!  Now that it is out i got back on the pill i was on in highschool. I have been on it for a month and Im still bleeding from that stupid implant. I really feel like it messed my body up and I dont know when the bleeding will stop and I cant stand it!!!!! Everytime I go to the doctor they dont have much to say and act like its no big deal... If i could make my decision all over again I would NEVER have chosen Implanon!!!!!!,F,24,6  months 1X D,4/21/2015,Implanon
29, 4, I was in an active relationship,For the first month I had about a 3 week long period. Then I got my period every 4 months for the first year_ then one period the next year and this last year and a half I haven't had my period at all.,Having the implant for 3 years has been a better form of contraceptive rather than the pill_ which I tried before but started forgetting. The implant never made me gain weight. I believe having it from ages 16-19 has had a big impact on puberty and growth with natural hormones_ meaning my body missed that time frame and didn't have any growth. I get it removed on Tuesday April 14th.,F,19,3  years,4/12/2015,Implanon

31, 1, Prevent unplanned pregnancy,Heavy constant bleeding_ uterine polyps and headaches,Do not get it!... I had a constant period for 3 months straight with headaches. I went to my family doctor who put it in and they took it out and sent me to the gynecologist. They found uterine polyps and told me I can have them removed and run the risk of them coming back_ or have them removed along with an ablation. In fear of them coming back_ I had the ablation....now I can't have any more kids.,F,30,3  months 1X D,3/30/2015,Implanon
32, 3, Prevent second pregnancy,I had the implanon put in after I gave birth in 2011 and on the plus side it prevented me from getting pregnant and I had zero periods when I had it. But that's also the downfall_ I thought it was great not having any periods while on it and when it came time to take it out I still wasn't getting any. About a month after it came out I was getting light brown periods that either lasted a few days or over a week_ and then I stopped having then altogether. I went on the pill to try and regulate and it worked for a little bit and then I just stopped getting them again. I had irregular periods growing up_ but never like this. My husband and I had been trying to get pregnant since late 2013 and have had no luck_ and it's really hard to know when you don't get a period.,It helped with not getting pregnant_ but totally screwed up my cycle,F,25,2  years,3/23/2015Email,Implanon

35, 1, birth control,I've had IMPLANON when I was 16-19. I never had a problem. I had my son after I turned 21. I decided to get the birth control again. Biggest mistake. I've been bleeding for 23 days straight now. It's not old blood its new. It acts like its going to stop then starts up the same day back to bright red. I've got headaches_body aches_ severe cramping_ bloating....the list goes on. I would much rather be pregnant at this point. It's definitely doing its job...no baby and practicing abstinence...its so frustrating. I would not advise anyone to get this birth control. I'm trying to get my OB to take it out of my arm.

37, 1, to prevent unwanted pregnancies,I hate implanon its the worst ever! I have mine in for four months now n for the first three months everything was fine just irregular bleeding....but as soon as I reached the forth month all went crazy. I started experiencing severe depression and anxiety which I never felt before; I had an instance when I nearly passed out and my forehead was wet because of the sudden sweating. I would feel angry n cry for nothing or find something. I even felt confused n like I'm just not myself. I made an appointment n I'm having it taken out. My arm pains on the area as well as my left leg and hand. I'm just really upset that medical PROFESSIONALS does not inform people about these side effects before hand. And many women complain about them refusing to remove the implant until up to 1 year. I  was told to wait till six months but I thought there's not a chance after all I read and heard. Its your choice as u no your body.would just be super of people can respect that! Anyway I no everyone is different so maybe the implant is good for some people but not me n I would not ever recommend it to anyone.it should be BANDED,,F,23,4  months,3/2/2015Email,Implanon

I wouldn't reccommend it to my worst enemy...  The first week was ok I thought my life was going to be great_ I don't have to think about taking the pill daily or having to go back to the injection. Which were also terrible experiences but I would trade the implanon any day. The second week OMG I cried everyday for hours. This was the type of crying where I wanted my life to end.. And then when I question why I was crying I had no reason then I would cry because I was angry for crying for no reason.. I would cry on a packed train. A packed bus Nd just start screaming and crying in my bedroom..  After a week I felt so good all off a sudden_ for like 3 days. I would dance into work_ make everyone laugh. Then all of a sudden I would want to just run to an island where no one exists. I started hating my boyfriend and would start arguments with him for things he did years ago_ we are currently on a break due to me not wanting to know anyone anymore. My sex drive went so low that I'm sure it's in hell somewhere_ I got abit so a sex drive when I had a lot of drink in me because it helped me more active. But when I'm at home I just want to lay down and never get up_ and when I do have sex it HURTS like crazy. It is such a painful experience. In the last 3 months we've had sex like 3 times but before we used to have sex every time we saw each other which was about four times a week.

42, 3, Prevent pregnancy,Almost constant bleeding 30 pounds of weight gain mood swings,I have had this in now for 2 and a half years and I just want it out. It works really well in terms of preventing pregnancy but the bleeding is unbearable. I never know when it will start or stop. Some months I'll be bleeding on and off for 3 weeks of the month. I have tried to eat healthy and exercise but I keep gaining weight. I'm going to have it removed very soon mainly due to the bleeding. I could handle irregular periods_ but this is a common thing now to be bleeding for a week then it will stop for five day and start all over again.

Although I haven't had my period since getting the implanon_ it's still not worth it. I'm having it removed next week.,The doctor who implanted it raved about how it doesn't cause weight gain and how few side effects it has. That's why I got it. I just recently went to another doctor with my concerns and she laughed! She said that the doctor who implanted it must not know very much about it because the top 2 reasons people have come to her to have it removed has been of the weight gain and depression!,F,29,4  months 1X D,2/8/2015,Implanon

47, 3, to prevent second pregnancy,When I first received the implanon I just got off the depo because of the complications that came with that I believed that implanon would be a better plan soon as I started the implanon I began bleeding immediately for months and would only stop for a week then start back up it was soooooo bad I couldn't take it anymore but I was only 3 1/2 months in my doc persuaded me to go on for at least 6 mnths before I got it tooken out so I made a apt to see what could help the bleeding stop they decided to put me on the pill for 3weeks then after I bleed for a few days now I have completely stopped bleeding I'm guessing my body had to get use to it I'm going on 6 months now and I recently got really bad cramps as if I was going get a period I spotted for like an hour then it went away I'm kinda lost on that one.

50, 1, Prevent pregnancy,It's amazing how such a small thing can make such a huge impact on somebody's life! My mood swings are probably one of the two biggest problems along with me never being able to stop bleeding unless I take the combined pill? Which again makes me more moody_ and when I say moody_ I mean MOODY I tend to snap at everything anybody says which had ruined a few relationships with people I care about. I also have a terrible time sleeping_ I can be so so tired but my body just won't go to sleep and I will be tossing and turning all night or I can be not tired at all and my body just seems to fall asleep when it has the chance_ this has effected work and my social life! I also eat a lot at unnecessary times such as 11:00 pm - 12:00 am. I had also had a phantom pregnancy which was pretty scary but at least I got to stop bleeding for a couple weeks! Wow one word to anyone who is thinking about getting one_ DONT!

I am nauseous all the time_ that also comes along with a huge headache. It had also had an impact on my sleeping_ I either do it all the time or not at all same with eating.  I haven't even gotten to the emotional kick of this. I am insanely moody_ just to give an example I bawled my eyes out over french fries. My periods are about 4-8 weeks long_ no sign I'm about to start other than bad acne and huge mood swings. They aren't regular at all but I have never been regular since I started having my periods.

I also experienced inconsistent periods; such as bleeding for 90 days straight_ then stopping for a month_ then another 90 days of bleeding... My pms & cramping that resulted from my erratic bleeding were worse than anything I experienced before_ on or off birth control.,I almost got the implant out many times I'm the past three years_ but somehow I convinced myself that it wasn't that bad.  Looking back at the past three years - I should've immediately taken it out. Many of the aforementioned side effects greatly impacted my personal life in a negative way.

Now I bleed up to two weeks at times. With intense cramps. Usually starting_ two days after I have sex. So I go two weeks bleeding then have sex and I will start bleeding again for two weeks. It is absolutly ridiculous.  My gynecologist who put the implant in told me at my 6 month_ to give it more time did tests and nothing came back. Now I'm at 15 months and it's still the same.

I am glad that I stuck with it as for the rest of the time it has been wonderful. My moods have been very constant and upbeat_ periods very infrequent and light_ no period pain or back cramping_ good sex drive. I am the biggest baby ever when it comes to needles and blood_ however I found the insersion and removal procedures bareable and not a bit painful. As someone who previously used the pill for five years_ I can fully recommend the implant and wouldn't hesitate to use it again after starting a family.

Then a week or 2 later I'd start again. 100% irritating. Now that I have it out I'm thinking it was also a source of my nausea.

Sometime 2 in a month and sometimes nothing for 2 months however even that is starting to level out and my last few months I have only had one per month and at pretty even times. Only usual 5 days.A small amount of acne under the chin which is definitely hormonal and bloating just before my period same as any contraception. I have been very emotional and feel very sad or irritable and lonely a lot during this time however I have been like this for as long as I can remember and on contraception of different sorts for the last 15 years so I do not really have any idea whether the strong emotions are due to the implanon or just me.,All in all I have found it great to not have to worry about remembering to take contraception or go to the Dr every 3 months for an injection so I would recommend giving it a try. Technically and symptoms should stop as soon as its removed so worst case scenario_ if your body doesn't agree with it_ you just remove it again and you should feel back to normal pretty quickly.,F,33,7.5  years 3X AN,10/30/2014,Implanon

100, 4, contraception,Only major side affect I have experienced is spotting. This is where you have little bits of bleeding here and there inbetween periods.I was mainly writing on here for those considering getting the implant who have acne.

It doesnt make it any worse_ but the excess hormones certainly dont help the spots disappear!,,F,17,3  weeks,10/25/2014,Implanon
101, 3, Birth control and periods,Okay so I've only had the implant for 3 weeks and therefore more than likely have plenty more side effects to witness but still_ I thought I'd rate it myself anyways. After reading multiple of the other ratings posted I must say I'm rather worried. I haven't suffered from many migranes_ only one or two and haven't gained any weight either. I have however witnessed an excessive period for over 12 days now_ it began with spotting which didn't really bother me_ it stopped for a few days and within that time I had sex with my boyfriend(I am aware I am younger than the majority of it's users_ but I've been in a serious relationship for over a year and a half now). After having sex my period got really heavy and since then it has been constant. I'm hoping I end up like my friends and some of the reviewers whom have claimed that their first period was extended and after that it ended completely. I don't want to take the pills that have been recommended by my gp to regulate them as they are known to cause massive weight gain. My sex drive hadn't really been effected until these last couple of days_ arrousal is almost impossible which is extremely frustrating. My mood swings have been almost unbearable considering I also suffer from bipolar disorder_  they have been hightened immensely since its insertation. I am hoping that my periods calm down_ if this isn't the case I intend on having it removed as this was the main reason I requested this form of contraception.,,F,15,3  weeks,10/25/2014Email,Implanon

I have went in 3 times for removal with no success getting the implant out of my arm. If you are young and want kids in the future I would not recommend implanon it may be causing me infertility by being expired and some what lost in my arm.

105, 1, Birth control,I had my period for 5 months straight_ then had to take the pill to stop my period_ then didn't have it for over a year. I DO NOT recommend implanon that will ever want kids in the future. My doctor tried forcing me to put back in_ including saying she wouldn't take it out until I agreed to put it back in. I had to get a new doctor. I had it for 3 years and like a month_ and she still was trying to refuse taking it out when it is supposed to be taken out at 3 years. I hate that I had this put in my body. I haven't been on any birth control since I had it taken out. I want kids_ and I am having a really hard time making that happen. A friend of mine has to have a hysterectomy because she got implanon. She already has one kid so thankfully she's not missing out on never having kids. But I am to the point of praying every night to hopefully have kids one day. IT WAS/IS A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!!,,F,20,3  years,10/12/2014Email,Implanon

I seem to be extremely moody.Throughout my second year my period seems to come with my emotional changes. If I'm sad_ period. If I'm excited_ period. If I'm nervous_ period. It's SUPER annoying.

110, 3, Birth Control,It's taken me almost 3 years to realize that most of the problems I've been having are probably coming from my Implanon.

Sometimes I get nauseous_ and sometimes I get dizzy spells. I've also had a constant ringing in my ears for months now_ I can't stand to be in silence because I hear it most then.,My periods are on a fairly regular schedule and have been pretty light.

114, 5, Birth control and endometriosis,I have had implanon for over 5 months. It was soo easy going in!! My doctor numbed me up_ I heard a click_ and didnt even feel it. For the first week after getting it_ my hormones were JACKED UP!! I was soo emotional towards everything. Once the first week passed_ I have been just fine ever since. It took me about 8 weeks to completley heal the incision site and bruising (the only real negative side effect I have truly felt with this birthcontrol.) My periods havent stopped completley_ but they have definitly slowed dramatically. In the 5 months I have had it_ I have only had 3 periods. Each one shorter in duration every time. I have noticed my sex drive isnt as strong as it used to be_ but with a loving and understanding partner than there really isn't a problem... I have also been experiencing some itching at the site where the device is located. The whole thing itches at random times. After a run or when Im setting down for sleep...other than that_ I highly suggest it as a birth control method for couples who dont like condoms_ have trouble remembering to take your birth control_ or even if female hormones arent good for you (they arent good for me since I have migranes.) Please also remember that this birth control method DOES NOT protect against Sexually Transmitted Diseases.,,F,21,5  months78mg,8/7/2014Email,Implanon

Don't turn down the oppertunity for an implant based on horrible storeys. Some people bleed horribly and get acne and weight gain. Done people never have periods and don't expirence many mood swings. It's always differnt from person to person. Hopefully I'll stop periods and mood swings ... Fingers crossed_  good luck to anyone considering it.,,F,16,1  days,8/5/2014,Implanon

I'm dizzy a lot_ I'm weak_ I'm tired_ I have no energy! Just recently today the site where the implanon is began to hurt now my entire arm feels weak and numb_ mainly my hand. Not sure why it has never done this. I haven't had sex since getting it_ as if it were possible any how with the constant period so I can't say it worlds for that or not.

121, 4, Birth control/ lighter periods,I've had nexplanon for almost two years now. My doctor had me switch to this because I get terrible aura migraines and the BC I was on previously greatly increased my risk for a stroke. The insertion of the implant was painless because I was numb but by the next day I had a bruise over my entire upper arm (that was fun to explain to people) this lasted for about three weeks. I went about two weeks without a period then the third week  I started spotting. This spotting last for over a year. It was really light so I didn't mind too much because my previous periods were so heavy and would last weeks at a time. About 13 months after I had the implant inserted I have not had a period or any spotting. Which is awesome no to have to deal with anymore along with not having to remember to take a pill everyday. The only side effect that I have had other than the spotting is really bad acne. My headaches occur a lot less often and are bearable when they do happen. Overall I would recommend the nexplanon to others.,,F,22,2  years1 dose,6/25/2014Email,Implanon

I had a miscarriage_ and I just needed time before I tried to conceive again. My dr. assured me this would not only be a great fit for my then situation_ but by me having endometriosis and IBS_ birth control could help with the cramps and painful menstrals. I trusted he knew what he was talking about. He'd never failed me in the past; Within the first three days_ I gained 13 pounds_ my face broke out_ I've been bleeding a dark almost black vaginally since then AND STILL is even though I just had it removed four days ago. He gave me some birth control pills and said it was because my uterus was thin and the birth control should help it thicken up_ but nothing. Even while it's gone it's still haunting me. My mood swings are off the richter scale_ my boyfriend has moved out_ and because of the icky bleeding our sex life is in shambles. DON'T GET THIS!

I don't know why the site is now asking me about this 'nexplanon' I came on hear to complain about the implant (I'm in the uk btw) anywho I'll still have a rant about the implanton as iv come this far already :).. I had the implant the first time when I was around 20 and it worked fine_ I didn't notice any problems and it stopped my periods all together! Good times! Then I had it removed after the 3 years were up and didn't get another one as I wanted to give my body a break and wasn't sexualy active at the time.. When I started dateing my now bf I decided to go back on to the implant.. This time has been TOTALY different! More or less constant bleeding for over a year (had it inserted june 2012) I have been anxious_ paranoid_ had suicidal thoughts (yep)_ mood swings_ bad skin_ greesy hair_ trouble sleeping and what felt like constant PMS and just all round feeling like crap tbh! I have never in my life been this way_kind of like I was constanly worried all the time.. I felt like the world was against me and my fuse was as short as a may flies life span. Omg. Nightmare.. Anyway it took me a while to realise that it was the implant that was making me feel this way.. I knew about the body changes_ weight gain_ bad skin ect but never about the 'mental' side.

Im not sure if its because its nexplanon now if its the prob but I hate it now and am having it removed in two weeks. I have very bad mode swings I hv gone from normal to bipolar n two months hum depressed cramps everyday since i had it. Not to mention the complete loss of my sex drive dont even want to be touched now_ and it has also broken out my face so this time its not working and I assure you not worth it i would rather take my chances I hv two kids now 9 and 5 and my symptoms preg were no where near this crappy. So not to be neg but this has been my experience I guess just bec something works once doesn't mean it will again_ other wise it works tho but not for me this time_ If you are thinking of getting it just be aware of all side effects and please explore other options.  ;-),,F,29,2  months,3/27/2013,Implanon

Depo was great too but I use to have an eating disorder and that makes bone loss issues more likely. Anyways.. I love nexplanon. Highly recommended!!!!!!

165, 1, Birth control & to regulate periods,Mood swings_ manic behavior_ exacerbation of OCD and anxiety_ panic attacks_ depression_ 50 lb weight gain_ severe water retention_ muscle aches_ headaches_ complete loss of libido_ constant spotting,I got my Implanon 2.5 yrs ago at a women's clinic and was deceived by them. They NEVER told me of the psychiatric side effects of this thing. I've had plenty of physical side effects also like weight gain and was told repeatedly that you don't gain weight from it. I gained 50 lb since I got it. Every year I went back for my annual_ I told them I gained weight_ and they still denied that it was the Implanon. That's not even the bad part of this whole thing. I've had OCD and anxiety since I was a teenager that was managed successfully with Celexa for yrs. Once I got this implant_ my whole world fell apart. My OCD has gotten so bad that I am constantly bombarded by unwanted_ irrational_ intrusive thoughts about my loved ones dying. It's absolute torture. I began having almost bipolar type behaviors. It got to the point where I couldn't tell apart my irrational obsessions from normal thought patterns. I went from being in control of my OCD to feeling like I was swimming against a current trying to just keep my head above water. I now take the maximum dose allowed of Zoloft_ Xanax to sleep_ and see a psychiatrist every 6 weeks. I still don't have my disorder under control. My implant is done in  a few months_ and I went to a new GYN to get it out and to get a tubal ligation. He told me that in women with psychiatric issues_ Implanon is the worst birth control to be on because it exacerbates existing psych conditions. It would've been nice to know that before I got this thing!!,F,29,2.5  years 1X O,4/21/2012Email,Implanon

168, 2, Contraception,When it was first inserted I became very angry and irrational for about a week. After this calmed down I had a great year with no periods and no other side effects. After this it began to go down hill with acne developing on my face_ back and arms_ weight gain_ irregular bleeding and migraines. I had it removed 6 months early last week and now it's a case of waiting to see if my body returns to normal. I wouldn't recommend this contraceptive to anybody who has trouble with their hormones and think I will be trying a non hormonal IUD next.,,F,24,3  years1 x O,3/26/2012,Implanon

If I could give this thing a negative I would. I remember a time when I was not an angry_ stressed out person_ so even if you love the idea of not having to worry about this birth control_ if you like to have people around you_ don't use this because you will drive everyone away because you will be the angriest person they'll know.,F,31,1  years 1X O,3/23/2012Email,Implanon
170, 3, Contraceptive,With my implanon_ the first few months were fine_ until I got a 18 day long period. *sigh* That was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I like how it's a contraceptive for 3 years but it's so inconvenient! One time I was in town in my good white jeans_ and you can guess what happened...I ruined my jeans because of it. I've been experiencing nausea_ moody_ very bad cramps ans irregular periods. But in the last week I've gotten a heap of pimples! I have never had pimples like this_ I used to have 3 a year! Now I just look terrible with this breakout.I'm not sure whether to keep this for my boyfriend and I or to get rid of it because I don't like it. I used to be on the pill_ but I'd always forget it.

171, 2, Birth control,I had implanon implanted 2 months after the birth of my youngest child. I used this form of birth control for 6 months before encountering any negative side effects. After that_ it became Hell. All of a sudden_ my acne came back worse than before after 2 years without a break-out. I began gaining loads of weight_ and wasn't even eating a lot at that point (poor appetite). When I began taking it_ I weighed 175 lbs and when I stopped taking it weighed a whopping 248 lbs. I felt so disguted with myself over this substantial weight gain. I made it through two pregnancies without ever getting over 200 lbs_ and then this happened. Another reason I stopped taking it was because I didn't get my period for the last 9 months I was on it_ which made me paranoid. After having it removed_ I have yet to regulate my periods. They have been messed up ever since. I also am now working on losing all the unnecessary and unhealthy weight I put on while having it.,,F,19,1  years,1/12/2012,Implanon

181, 1, Birth Control,Excessive & prolonged bleeding,"My first period after getting Implanon was horrible. I spent the first day of it soaking through maxi pads as well as passing several giant blood clots. After the first day_ the period seemed to be ""normal"" but it lasted for two long weeks!! My periods before Implanon were light/average and lasted only five days. After the first period on Implanon_ I had a few monthly periods that lasted anywhere from a week and a half to two weeks but for the past six or seven months my periods have lasted anywhere from 3-4 weeks at a time. When I'm not bleeding_ I have brown spotting and still have to use tampons. I go through 4-6 tampons daily every month! Its really expensive to stay stocked up on all the tampons I need_ so I've purchased a DivaCup to keep from having to spend so much money. A big issue the bleeding has caused is interference with sex! You cannot have a normal_ good sex life when you are constantly bleeding or spotting. For this issue_ I've purchased Softcups which are like the DivaCup except that they can be worn during sex. But still... It would be nice to have normal sex without having to worry about blood. After a year of torture_ I will be getting off Implanon this month! I wouldn't recommend Implanon personally_ but I have seen in other reviews that some women have really liked it and haven't experienced any bad side effects.

Being on birth control pills worsened by depression drastically_ the Nuva-ring fell out without me realizing it_ and am wary of the IUD. However_ no sex drive??!! No sex drive?! And when I do have sex_ it has become impossible for me to orgasm.

185, 1, birth control and abnormal bleeding,This was a nightmare. I became extremely emotional_ non-stop crying_ depression_ anxiety. Completely killed my sex drive and ability to become sexually aroused. I withdrew emotionally from my partner and we nearly broke up. I can't emphasize enough how utterly disgusting and hopeless I felt on this_ I was quite suicidal at some points. When my first period on this arrived_ it never stopped until I got the rod out -  I bled for over a month.,This needs to come with some severe warnings. I know some women use it quite happily_ but for many more it is a nightmare. The doctors hesitated to remove it until I threatened to get a razor and do it myself (which I would have_ I was that desperate). After it was removed I started to feel better within days. However_ 3 years later_ I still don't feel as good as I did before I used it_ and still suffer some depression and anxiety of a form I never had before the Implanon.
