0, 1, Fibromyalgia,,"My mom was on this shit of a medicine. Let me clearly explain to you what happened to her since she cannot do it. She is currently in a medically induced coma. Why? Because this medicine ate her stomach. The doctors said her stomach is so badly damaged because of this medicine_ they are not sure she is going to make it. Two weeks ago she become extremely ill with a perforated bowel and renal failure. They had to rush her into emergency surgery because she had severe sepsis. The surgeon did not expect her to make it out of surgery much less begin to heal.She started healing but had to be rushed back into emergency surgery because she had another perforation. That was Friday. These next few days are extremely crucial.Because of her immune system being compromised. She has been running a high fever and the doctors think she has C. Diff as her stomach was hit pretty hard. Her small intestine is now stapled to her stomach and she is eaten away with ulcers. Her kidney levels have came down thank goodness. Put another way_ I had found this this past weekend from http://www.klinespecter.com/worstpills_publiccitizen.htm""Indocin (Merck)_ indomethacin Indocin also is in the family of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often used to treat arthritis in older patients.

1, 5, Gout Torn Meniscus,Very few. A miracle drug.,Most of the patients do not take INDOMETHACIN or INDOCIN with food and lots of it. Knocks out 75% of the bad short term side effects.Because long term use can lead to heart or liver damage_ I always limit intake for 203 days no more than twice a month. Debilitating pain from gout_ arthritis and torn meniscus truly neutralized. ALWAYS take with a big meal and you may well have no real problems. Long term is no good. This drug is a blessing from God.,M,69,3  days25 2X D,2/8/2015,Indocin
2, 1, nerve pain/headache_ to diagnose,"have been having on/off facial nerve pain - left side of face_ starts in teeth_ goes up to eye. took indomethacin as prescribed by neurologist_ as a diagnostic tool_ to help rule out certain conditions. Rx is for 75mg ER (extended release) indomethacin capsules_ 1-3 a day. first time_ a couple weeks ago_ took 2 caps (about 1 hr apart)_ with food/ water etc as cautioned_ no noticeable side effects. 2nd time_ same thing - 2 caps_ about 1hr apart (took 2nd bc pain was cotintinuing). took food / water etc. only diff: probably had less sleep_ and was under some stress. had severe side effects similar to those described by several other WOMEN here (as far as what i have noticed). laid down after taking. about 3-4 hrs after_ stood up to get food/ water_ felt extreme dizziness_ vertigo_ like i was going to fall over / faint. considered calling 911. made it to neighbor's (had to hold on to wall). lay down. speaking was difficult - as if my brain had been slowed down. hands trembled. couldn't sit up. felt extremely ""out of it"". severity went in waves - every couple mins. it was extremely scary. got better after couple of hours (slowly took food / water while laying down). will NEVER take again.",,F,37,1  days2-75mg ER,9/15/2014,Indocin
3, 3, Migraine pain,"About 45 minutes after taking one 50 mg. capsule_ I felt as I was losing conciousness- my heart rate slowed to about 40 bpm_ could not catch my breath_ was panting_ was very dizzy and had graying out of my vision_ and ears ringing like before  faint.  when I got out of bed to get some ice water ( I thought maybe drinking cold water would ""revive"" me)_ my legs felt as if they would collapse. Could not stand upright- after about 5 minutes of debating_ I was sure I would pass out here alone_ so I called paramedics ad laid by the front door to wait for them. It passed while they were here. My BP had spiked really high_ but my heart rate was way too slow. Felt weak and had terrible abdominal cramping and intense thirst for the rest of the day. Heart still feels weak and fluttery 24 hours later.",I have taken one 50 mg. capsule before a few different times for migraine with great success for pain relief_and had just a little sleepiness and weakness_ but this was extreme and terrifying. I guess I cannot take this medication any more. Very disappointed_ and surprised that an NSAID can cause such extreme CNS malfunction.,F,57,1  days50 mg 1X D,6/30/2014Email,Indocin
4, 5, Gout,had gout for over a month_ allopurinol had brought uric acid under control but gout was not going away.  was prescribed up to 3x a day_ but only took 1x a day.  Definitely take with food. Did have a sever hypotension reaction once and reduced lisonpril to compensate.  Feelings of dizziness_ uneasiness at first_ but later became more of a euphoric effect.  Feel that prolonged use may cause stomach problems as well as possibly tendon problems (sudden feeling of stiffness in joints).  recommend only using during attacks and getting off it as quick as possible.,Less is better!,M,39,7  days30mg 1X D,7/2/2013Email,Indocin
5, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis,No side affects.,I started taking this drug when it was first introduced in the 1960s as nothing else worked. Within one hour of taking the first dose I was symptom free. I did have to do once a week blood testing for the first year to ensure that it was not doing any damage to internal organs. Tests verified no adverse effects. A true miracle drug.,M,63,40  years50mg 1X AN,5/3/2013,Indocin

10, 4, Cluster Headaches,Dizziness_ upset stomach_ lightheaded feeling_ headache.I have taken this medication once yearly since 2005. Normally I take 50mg 3x per day for about a week_ then taper off to 2x then 1x per day over the next week. When I first started using this medication_ I had slight upset stomach but nothing else. Over the years I have started getting worse side effects each time I use it. The dizziness has progressively become worse. I have also started waking up with hangover-like headaches. Within 20 minutes of taking a dose I become light headed and stay that way for about an hour. More food and water seems to help with all of the side effects. I take this medication in combination with Atenolol. Without the Indomethacin_ the Atenolol can take 4-6 weeks to break a cluster headache cycle. In combination the drugs help stop the clusters in about two weeks. Until the side effects become totally unbearable_ I'm sticking with the Indomethacin_ since nothing else has worked so quickly to break a cluster cycle for me. Be sure to take this medicine with plenty of food and water and don't take anything else for a headache. I find that the headache I wake up with usually dissipates after my morning dose.,,F,31,3  days50 mg x 3,2/13/2012Email,Indocin
11, 5, Gout,I get severe gout in my feet_ ankles_ and right elbow and thumb.  It is severe to the point that I cannot get my shoes on and when it attacks my ankles I cannot walk.  My dr started me on indocin 50 mg three episodes ago.  Ian supposed to take three per day for ten days but I have not had to take them for more than one day.  I take the third dose_ go to bed and wake up gout free.  I used to suffer for up to two weeks per attack.  I have noted very mild light headedness but it is easily tolerated.

12, 1, pericardial effusion,Extreme dizzy feeling; inside my head things seemed to swirl around; originally was to take 3 pills/per day.  Told the Doctor I could not do this; he reduced prescription to twice daily.  Eventually had a stroke-like allergic reaction; took 14 months to recover.,Doctors and pharmacists insist this drug cannot cause this type of reaction; they are all wrong.  Within 15 minutes of taking the prescribed dose I would become ill.  Initially I was very dizzy and had a bad buzzed feeling which caused things to be fuzzy.  After the final allergic reaction_ I could not walk_ speak or write properly for a very long time.  I also developed a perception problem with heights and was afraid to drive across high freeways_ on-ramps_ etc.  I had none of these problems before taking this drug.  This was a horrible experience that affected my life negatively for about 14 months after taking the drug.,F,37,38  days 2X D,9/16/2010,Indocin

14, 4, Occipital neuralgia,No side effects when taken regularly.,I was first put on indocin for occipital neuralgia but kept on it for degenerating disks and a multitude of other aches.  I take it along with many other medications for a brain injury caused by chemicals.  I have had such a problem over the last few years of excessive sleepiness so my Dr. wanted me to try cutting back on indocin.  I feel like I have been hit by a truck.  At first I thought I was getting the flu_ which is almost impossible with the meds I take.  Now I am sore head to toe_ every muscle. has anyone else experienced this.,M,42,6  years25mg 3X D,6/23/2010,Indocin
15, 3, Gout,I have been taking Indocin on and off for a while. However I recently suffered a couple of panic attacks which I can now suspect to be as the result of taking the tablet and caffiene close together. The first time I thought I was having a heart attack and ended up in hospital ; the second time I realised what was happening and tried deep breathing but it still took 20 mins to get over. Don't take with a double espresso!,,M,49, 75mg 2X D,6/9/2010,Indocin
16, 5, I take medicine for Gout,I suffer gout for many years now and taking Indocin greatly decreased excruciating pain due to flare ups of my gout. The recent attack was the most severe since it affected so many joints in my left foot. However the side effects are no joke. I experienced burning sensation in my stomach to the point that I felt nauseated with episodes of headaches. To relieve these problems though_ eat high fiber foods after 30 mins of taking the medicine or whenever you start feeling that burn. High fiber such as Celery sticks (peanut butter/ranch dressing are good)_ baby carrots _ Apples and oranges_ and drink a lot of water with it until you feel like you have eaten a full meal. Trust me_ these helps once your stomach starts digesting the food you will feel the effect of relief. Just be patient and you will feel a night vs day relief.,Taking this capsule needs a lot of self relief management. Eat constantly. I recommend almonds. I have stash of almonds or celery I carry around to eat constantly to relieve the stomach pains. One thing also that I noticed_ due to the pains it forced me to eat healthy and lost significant weight.,F,43,5  days50 mg 2X D,5/20/2010Email,Indocin

19, 2, anti-inflammatory for back pain,I took 1 pill in the evening and the next day I took a total of 3. The following day when I took the morning pill I had a slight headache most of the day. By 4 PM_ I had the worst headache I ever had in my life. The med helped bring down the back inflammation_ and the pain in my back was gone...but the horrible headache kept me from taking any more.,I was given a demoral shot in the ER on a Friday night and I slept most of Saturday away. Every time I work up in the first 8 hours_ my headache was still there.,F,49,3  days,8/5/2009,Indocin
20, 1, don't remember,After 2 full days of use_ I got a 'headache'(BEYOND description) so bad I had to go to ER. I really thought my brain had swelled and was trying to get out of my skull. I told Dr. in ER it was the medicine. He said I had a 'migraine' and it couldn't be the drug. I don't know what they shot me up with but it reversed the problem quickly,Stay close to a hospital when and if you take this drug!,M,37,2  days,6/26/2009,Indocin

22, 4, Gout,It was great at stopping the Gout in my foot_ but there were occasional scary side effects. I don't know for sure what the triggering mechanism is_ but every once in a while_ about 2 hours after taking one 50mg cap_ I would get a strange feeling_ like I was buzzed_ but not in a good way.. then the adrenalin would kick in and my heart rate would skyrocket. I tried not to think about it_ but the wooozie feeling kept coming and going_ and finally disaperas after about an hour. I strongly believe there is an adverse reaction to caffine.,I do not take the drug unless Gout is present. Usually once to three times a year,M,48,11  years,1/27/2009Email,Indocin
23, 5, Pain in joints thru out body,No side effects at all.,I have been told by some doctors that taking indocin for a long time will damage my kidneys. I tried to stop taking indocin and within three days it feels like i am falling apart. my back feel like it is breaking in two. i have scoliosis and arthritis in all of my joints. I have cut back to 40 mg a day_ taken with breakfast_ and that amount works just fine. I tried six other anti-inflamitories over the years and they did not work for me. At 67 years i can still climb trees to hunt deer. without indocin i would be finished.,M,67,7  years,1/10/2009Email,Indocin
24, 4, I had Eyeritus,"I started taking indocin SR 26 years ago. I experienced problems with my stomach and then switched to indomethacin and those problems went away. However_ now_ 26 years later (actually the past several years) I've had a constant ringing in my ears and I'm gradually loosing my hearing. I've been studying the Polish language and my lack of hearing's been a problem. I got hearing aids and they don't help that much - especially when there's ""cross-talk"" going on.","I take 50mg each night and it's important to take it with milk or food. Another problem that's developed over the past several years is a loss of my ""singing"" ability. My voice has gotten raspy and singing has become more difficult. All that to say that I need to check with my Doctor to see if there's something else I can use. In the past there has been no other meds that have helped like Indomethacin. If I discontinue taking it_ after 3-4 days my whole body begins to stiffen up - my muscles cramp to the point that I can't sleep - or hardly walk.",M,56,26  years,8/26/2008Email,Indocin
25, 3, Gout,Took care of the gout w/i 2-3 days but experienced some stomach cramping (no big deal) but the worst of it my skin aches.  I noticed when showering_ the water pressure hurt me - as I started to rub those areas I realized quickly that every inch of my body hurt to the touch.  As I'm typing this_ I can hardly move my right arm as my shoulder is extremely tender.  I was taking two 75 mg daily.  I'm not taking any more.,,M,49,1  weeks,4/18/2008,Indocin
26, 1, Gout,I take indocin occasionally to treat my gout flare ups never again! For the last week or so Ive been taking 1-2 pills daily for a recent gout flare-up and suddenly had a very scary side-effect. The bottom line was I though I was loosing my mind. So much so my wife had to take me to the emergency room. It was so bad that I had an MRI done to rule out a stroke! The best way for me to describe it; after I take the drug I feel dizzy then a few days into the medication I started feeling depressed and then a few days after that I became totally confused_ delusional and depersonalized to the point where I thought I was going out of my mind! ,I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG AGAIN!,M,,7  days,3/24/2008Email,Indocin
27, 4, Severe Hypnic Headache,Constipation_ bloating_ prolonged nocturnal sleep_ excessive dreaming,I take Indocin s-r exactly two hours before bedtime to try to prevent hypnic headaches which occur like an alarm clock when I go into rapid-eye-movement (REM) stage sleep.  At 4:38 in the mornings I would awaken with excruciating pain as though my head would explode_ worse than any migraine I have experienced.  I tried all the regular migraine drugs including triptans_ hypnotics/sedatives_ narcotics_ and nothing helped one iota.  A headache specialist properly diagnosed the hypnic headache and put me on Indocin SR.  I awake with a mild headache still during some nights or in the AM_ but I cannot tolerate two Indocin SR's at night (Stomach upset).  I am truly grateful for this medication and for my physician who diagnosed this very rare type of headache.,F,51,5  months,3/2/2008Email,Indocin
28, 3, Arthritis,None!,I was thrilled when I woke up the first morning after starting Indocin and found that after 3 years of arthritis pain_ I was pain free. About one month later_ I had a Kidney stone attack and had to go to the ER. The ER doctor was amazed that I had been put on Indocin since I was also on Coumadin. He told me that first thing in the morning_ I was to call my GP and inquire as to the adviseability of being on Indocin while taking Coumadin. When I saw the GP_ he canceled my Indocin that moment. If you are on Coumadin_ check with your GP before starting Indocin. I was told it could precipitate large scale bleeding that might not be reversible in time.,M,66,30  days,2/23/2008,Indocin
29, 5, Occasional gout,None_ but you must take this medication with food otherwise it will irritate your stomach.,I have occasional bouts of gout and within a couple of hours of taking indomethicin the symptoms are all but gone.  For me it works great. BTW_ I know some think this is an old wives' tale but black cherries_ lots of them_ along with the indocin is great for gout.,M,57,2  years,11/17/2007,Indocin
30, 2, Polyarthritis,One day I felt very dizzy_ kind of spacey_ and felt like I was going to go crazy.  My work called 911 and I was taken to the hospital.  They said I had a panic attack.  Since that dreadful day_ I have had panic attacks every day_ along with dizziness_ a floating-type of feeling_ and heightened sound (like I was going to freak out from the noise).  Was recently diagnosed with underactive thyroid_ so the doctor's said this panic was a side effect and put me on Seroquel and Xanax.  This didn't make sense to me and I still had these feelings_ so I did some checking online and found this site and was AMAZED at the similarities in my symptoms from everyone. I am now off the Indocin_ and have not had ANY panic whatsoever!  Thank you for everyone's input_ as this really helped me!!,If you are feeling CRAZY for some strange reason while you are on this medication_ IT'S NOT YOU.......IT'S THE DRUG!!,F,42,3.5  months,11/6/2007Email,Indocin

33, 3, rheumatoid arthritis,slight dizziness or off balance_ depersonalization_ mild heartburn,Initially i was put on prednisone to take with the onset of a flareup.

35, 5, Gout,Depersonalization_ dizzy_ out-of-body feeling.,I generally use traditional NSAIDS when I feel a gout attack occuring - but if I get full blown flare they dont do the trick and I resort to Indocin.  I dont like using the Indocin -but it does the trick really well and fairly quickly.  I use it as an option of last resort.  I really respect this drug - and hate it.  Damn you Indocin - why cant you be easier to use!,M,47,15  months,5/27/2006,Indocin
36, 1, Gout,I have rare and brief bouts of Gout periodically and have used Indomethacin on those occasions to stop the pain. I rarely take more than a total of  2 (50 mg ) caps in a day because the discomfort appears to disappear fairly quickly. Today something horrific occurred. This morning shortly after taking 1 (50 mg) cap I started to feel very strange and went into a full blown panic attack_ thinking I was having a nervous breakdown. I was unsteady on my feet_ trembling_ had dry mouth and actually thought I was losing my mind. I was about ready to call an ambulance because I thought I was incapable of caring for myself and might do something real crazy; I was scared. I went walking_ thinking that would help as I was incapable of sitting with my mind in such complete disarray. I had trouble dialing my mobile phone but finally contacted a British doctor_ who was an acquaintance of mine_ and he wanted to see immediately whereby he promptly gave me a valium_ which I could not even take out o,After the Valium_ I was able to nap for about 2 hours and felt almost like myself again; 6 hours later I almost back to my normal self again. Needless to say_ I won't be taking this drug again. ,M,75,15  times,4/14/2006,Indocin
