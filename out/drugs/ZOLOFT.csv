3, 4, Depression and anxiety,Decreased appetite and anxiety the first week. Withdrawal symptoms including brain zaps_ slight headache_ decreased apetite_ dizziness_ nausea_ and anxiety.,Took it for a year and 4 months. Not sure if it was the drug itself or because my life situation changed but my depression and anxiety gradually became less. I could still feel down sometimes and have anxiety attacks but they would never be as frequent or as bad as before taking the medicine. Stopped taking it when I felt no need for it anymore (with an OK from my doctor). Stepped down to 25mg for two weeks before stopping completely. Withdrawal symptoms appeared 3 days after my last pill and lasted for a week. It's been 1_5 months since and I feel fine.,F,20,1  years50mg,7/14/2016,Zoloft

12, 3, Depression,Periods of time when I was starving literally all day despite having eaten a normal amount. Really bad insomnia for the first 6 months - has gotten better but now I sleep way too much and am always tired. Used to get pretty bad anxiety for the first 3 or so months but now that is very rare. The hunger has probably been the most unmanageable of the side effects for me.,Can't say it didn't work. I definitely started feeling less gloomy around 2 weeks after I started taking the med. I was initially on 25MG but got moved up to 50. About a year in I've found that the medication has an immediate effect on me right after I take it_ and the effect of each pill seems to last almost exactly 24 hours. Whenever I've forgotten to take a pill for a day or two I can clearly tell that I feel way more hopeless and depressed. About 2 hours after taking a pill I'll usually be just fine again. Kind of worried that I may be too dependent on it.,F,18,1  years50 MG,5/23/2016Email,Zoloft

15, 3, Postpartum depression,Extreme fatigue,My usual antidepressant is Prozac but I was given Zoloft for my postpartum depression because Prozac was not safe to take while breastfeeding. Zoloft definitely improved my mood but made me sleep constantly which was not conducive to my taking care of a newborn. I tried to stick it out hoping my body would adjust to the Zoloft but after about three months I realized I would not be able to continue to care for my baby with such a low level of energy_ no matter how much sleep I got I struggled to stay awake_ so I stopped taking it_ and almost immediately my energy came back. I had to switch my baby to formula but it was worth it to have enough energy to function. Zoloft did help my mood though so it wasn't all bad. The negatives outweighed the positives for me personally.,F,22,3  months50 mg,5/17/2016,Zoloft

Slight nausea sometimes if I take it on an empty stomach.,This drug is not for everyone_ but it works well for me. My symptoms are decreased and I am able to function much more normally. I was a wreck before I started seeing a therapist. She recommended that I try the Zoloft after meeting with me for a few months. It helped a lot. Shortly after this_ I was diagnosed with Crohns disease. So that was what may have triggered my symptoms. Anyway_ through it all the Zoloft helped me manage the stress. I recommend seeing a mental health professional (not just family DR) before starting Zoloft though. Now I get it from my PCM but Im glad I saw a therapist while I was starting with it.,F,39,7  years100 1X D,4/29/2016,Zoloft

When I went down to half a pill it didn't help at all. On my first day I spent literally all day in bed nauseated (I was surprised I didn't vomit).

And whenever I increased my dose (+25mg) I had a constant headache/stomach ache for at least a week,This medicine did nothing for me unfortunately. It works wonders on my mum_ so I gave it a shot but sadly it gave me more anxiety/depression like symptoms. I would wake up in a pile of sweat every single morning and woke up and went to bed with headaches. There were no positive side effects for me and getting off of it was really rough -  withdrawal symptoms were the same as the side effects plus brain zaps.

Once I found myself on the toilet wondering who I was_ where I was_ what day it was_ time of day_ etc. TERRIFYING!!! so I (obviously) stopped taking it. It was a BRUTAL 6 months of withdrawals. Months of torturous vertigo and what I can only describe as brain buzzing. It felt like when you are falling asleep and jerk awake. I had 5+ a minute for months.

36, 5, anxiety,cloudy headed for the first few days_ but went away entirely,I wanted to share my experience with Zoloft_ because it changed my life. During my undergraduate education I suffered with crippling anxiety attacks_ which almost led me to quit school. My doctor put me on Zoloft (this was back in 2003) 25mg_ and gradually raised the dose to 100mg over the course of a few months. It was almost like a light switch turned on in my brain. I just didn't get anxiety attacks anymore. I am so very thankful for this drug_ because without it I don't think I would've been able to continue my education (which ultimately led me to become a doctor). I have now finally weaned myself off of Zoloft (100mg_ down to 50mg for 1 year_ 25mg for 6 months_ then 25mg every other day for 2 months_ then off completely). If you are struggling with anxiety_ perhaps my story will help change your life too. There are so many negative reviews online_ so I thought I'd share a success story. For me Zoloft was a lifesaver.,M,37,12  years100mg 1X D,12/29/2015Email,Zoloft

Went up to 75mg for a week and it knocked me out. Doctor advised to go back down to 50mg_ and at about the month mark_ I noticed that my baseline anxiety level was now manageable.

45, 4, Depression,Myoclonus_ anal itching.,I took Zoloft way back in 1996-97 for about a year and a half_ first at 50 MG_ then 25 MG. It gave me a real boost_ I had more energy and was more positive and focused. The myoclonus can be annoying as they affect small muscles all over the body_ from the face to the feet. The anal itching was the worst. I actually get that with all SSRI's_ not just Zoloft. I guess it has to do with the increased bowel movements. The effects of Zoloft_ including the side effects_ lasted for many years after I stopped taking it. One positive side effect was also that it cured my premature ejaculation. Otherwise it didn't affect my libido. One potentialy negative side effect of all antidepressants is that you feel a little emotionally detached from your environment. It can help you through bad periods of your life but you may also miss or overlook signs that things around you aren't for the best. Always take these drugs under the supervision of a professional.,M,25,18  months50 MG 1X D,11/24/2015Email,Zoloft

I understand that FDA has not approved any medications yet for BDD_ but this was kind of an experiment to see what would work best with me. Zoloft did not work AT ALL for me. It made my symptoms worse_ in fact. I started binge eating again. It basically cancelled out any benefits that Wellbutrin gave me. I had 20-30 heart palpitations a day. I was an anxious wreck. It's strange because I've used Zoloft in the past for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I was a young child_ but my mother said it worked well for me. Oh_ well.

I finished one prescription and the second one I never finished it. After 3 weeks of taking it I saw myself losing my mind_ yes it was helping but it was making me someone I've never been. Being that I'm a writer and in touch with my soul_ I self diagnosed myself and as I felt a little better I would skip days and force myself to regain my own emotional strength and when there was days that I couldn't handle the depression that would be when I would take it to calm me down. Then I would force myself to gain strength to keep going without it. It did help in that sense_ but that was because I didn't want it to control me and my natural behaviors as it was in the first 3 weeks. I got kicked out of college because of mental trauma and I felt as if it wouldn't go away. Best advise I could give you is if u do take this it will not cure the depression ur in but it will help you cope with it if you take it only when you're feeling as if you can't handle it on your own_ it does help. Also be in control don't let the medication control you_ as far as libido it does come back so have faith if ur strong willed and in control of the medication it will come back.

In the initial two weeks on the medication I also experienced tingling and numbness in my fingers_ toes and lips_ as well as brain zaps.,It helped my depression in the sense that it stopped me from feeling anything. I kept persisting with it at the advice of my doctor_ being reassured that it was worth it in the long run. But I would not recommend it to anyone. This medication ruined my life. Four months after I stopped taking it my memory_ concentration and libido have not fully returned. I'm still struggling with my weight. I still feel numb_ yet my anxiety is as bad as ever.

The side effects got stronger and stronger as I felt brain fog_ chronic fatigue and all those other side effects I mentioned on a daily basis. I would also wake up in the mornings drained out feeling dizzy_ making it real hard for me to get ready and go to work. I also gained like 7lb while on zoloft.

After consultation with a psychiatrist we are focusing on the possibility of bi-polar/mood disorder and he recommended adding Trileptal_ and I have to say for the past 20 days the combo of Zoloft_ Trileptal and continued cognitive based therapy I am finally starting to feel as I should.,M,43,5  months75MG 1X D,7/22/2015,Zoloft

It's been extremely stressful_ but I thank God I'm alive with no neural deficit. However_ I could no longer deal with the PTSD/anxiety/depression without help. I was starting to cross over into OCD.I attended a COG program (outpatient) and it was suggested that I try Zoaloft. I started at 12mg for 4 days_ then 25 for 4 days_ then 50 for a week_ then 100_ now 150. I have not gained weight (I lost 10) or experienced sleep disturbances (I do take minipress for nightmares though) or brain fog or anything like that. I feel like myself_ but now I have time before the anxiety affects me to apply the COG tools_ or journal_ or think of a more balanced idea in whatever the situation is. I would suggest trying zoaloft_ but start slow and really examine if it's affecting you negatively. Don't be pushed into staying on if it's not working.

I began having zero interest in food_ morning_ noon_ and night. I had to force myself to eat_ which is not like me at all_ and it was a terrible way to live. Depersonalization set in and I honestly did not even feel like I was here_ and I almost felt as if nothing was real - a scary feeling to have for seemingly no reason. I also felt as if I wanted to just crawl out of my skin_ because I was extremely restless_ didn't know what to do with myself_ and just felt crazy. I couldnt remember a thing - for example_ I'd put something down in my car_ drive 3 minutes to my boyfriend's house_ and completely forget that I even brought something in the car with me. I also was experiencing these odd burning sensations that would shoot down the back of my neck and also from my wrists to fingertips - it was just strange. I had much trouble sleeping due to restlessness and also because my body ached_ so I could never get comfortable.

I wasn't comfortable unless it was 20 degrees outside and I had on a short sleeve shirt. Where I live it rarely gets that cold. Maybe twice a year. Made my blood pressure go up. Had vivid dreams at night which prevented me from getting any meaningful sleep. Had to take a combination of Seroquel and Restoril to get any sleep. Also had a hard time reaching orgasm.I take a calcium/magnesium/vitamin d supplement now and it takes the edge off my stress. Google the benefits of this supplement. It helps cholesterol as well. I quit smoking many years ago and it was easier to quit smoking than get off this mess.  I still take medication for sleep.,Over 7 years I took various medications which mess with your serotonin. I knew they made me feel bad but when I tried to stop taking them the side effects were severe. The worst of which felt like electric zaps to my brain. It was unbearable. I would be miserable and start back taking it. finally reached a weight that in my mind I would have to do something about. Went to my dr and she said well I can give you this Wellbutrin and it should help you lose weight and eventually could replace the Zoloft. Two weeks after I began the Wellbutrin I stopped taking the Zoloft. Same old withdrawals but this time the Wellbutrin took the edge off. haven't taken the Zoloft since thanksgiving 2013.  woke up one day in June 2014 and felt as if I had come out of a fog. Everything seemed crisp and clear. It took 6 months for it to completely get out of my system and to feel normal again.I could not be happier.  I lost about 25 pounds_ stopped being hot and sweaty all the time_ quit having vivid dreams_ and cut my blood pressure meds in half!  So I was right that it was hurting me not helping. I was able to stop the Wellbutrin easily.  I experienced periods of extreme anger but it was because that had been suppressed in me for years. My body didn't know how to feel angry. I rarely ever cried when I was taking it. So I allowed myself to feel that way without taking any action towards anyone on it.

I have another appointment with my Psych in a week and I will let her know about all of the effects i'm facing and see if she can help me find some relief.

I have continued to have breakthrough episodes of depression/anxiety (even after adding Wellbutrin a couple of years ago)_ but the length is shortened and the bottom not nearly as deep. Adding Wellbutrin was also good - reduced the damaging sense of existential loneliness that often lurked in the background of my mind. The only long term side effect that I am aware of is sweating at night. Because of my continued depressive episodes_ a Psychiatrist is changing me to Effexor.

I've always had bouts of depression_ I have a history of major anxiety to the point of it being physically painful_ and developed OCD over time. When I switched to nights I became a complete mess. I could not even lift my head up because of how depressed I felt_ and it scared me. I asked my PNP to give me zoloft_ after thinking long and hard. I was extremely skeptical and afraid to take it_ terrified to say the least_ because I had a horrible reaction to a few other anti-Ds. After having it on my nightstand for about a week_ I finally started taking the first weeks 25mg and then upped it to 50mg the following week_ which I am on now.  I must say that I noticed a dramatic difference- I'm always tired because of night shift_ but I feel NO depression. I find myself able to fully concentrate_ despite the slight dizziness and brainfog it gives. I stated I feel apathy_ but I believe its because I feel apathy towards things that used to make me sad and depressed_ and anxious.  As far as my OCD_ I have less trouble dealing with my intrusive thoughts and am not a nervous wreck following my episodes.  Even though I feel slightly numbed out_ I notice I'm more relaxed than I have ever been-the brainfog does not interefere with my patient care and safety.

113, 5, GAD_ Mild Depression,I am very sensitive to meds so I started at only 1/2 pill of a 25mg tablet. After a week I went to 25mg_ stayed on that for about 3 weeks and went to 37.5 (1 1/2 tablets).  I had heart flutters for the first few weeks but they went away.  Some nighttime wakefullness so I take a benadryl when I go to bed.  Felt a little like I had too much caffeine at first_ made my pupils dillate which it still does to some extent.  Took away my ability to orgasm which is the worst part of taking the medicine.  In making you feel better emotionally it also kind of  dulls your nerve endings.,This has helped me a lot.  I have stopped crying all the time and feel less emotional.  My anxiety is definitely a lot better and mild depression improved.  At 50mg I feel a little numb but at 37.5 its just about right and can feel and laugh.  I hate that its not good for my sex life but for now its more important that I feel better which I do.  My advice would be start very low and increase it slow.,F,52,4  months37.5-50mg 1X D,8/23/2014,Zoloft

I wanted to take her back to the hospital. I thought I had ruined my life. I saw no happiness in sight.  I struggled for 2 months until my family pushed me to go to my OB and talk.  She Rx me Zoloft 25mg/day for 2 weeks_ then upped it to 50mg/day.  Within a couple weeks things were SO MUCH BETTER.  I finally could smile and enjoy my new family and see a future for us all. I have been taking it for 7 months now and am starting the weaning process.  I hope it goes well_ because I NEVER want to go back to that dark place again.

116, 4, Anxiety/Panic,Increased anxiety first week of drug_ along with jittery_ stomach issues_ weird dreams_ insomnia,I'm a 19 yr old female & have always struggled with anxiety my whole life in all different types of situations & times_ but never to the extent I recently started experiencing. A little background--I was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) when I was 15_ so needless to say_ I've always had a hormone issue. This past year has been crazy for me_ I took a year off of school after graduating HS and focused on myself. I lost 70 pounds & that seemed to fluctuate my hormones & started causing issues for me. Long story short_ I was put on Provera (synthetic progesterone) to jumpstart my period so I could be on birth control to have regular cycles. I did that in the winter time until late spring and stopped the birth control once I got a horrible case of Mono. I needed to go back on the birth control a few weeks ago and so I took the Provera again. This time_ it triggered severe anxiety to come out. I woke up one morning and felt scared about the day and just not right. I then had severe panic attacks the next morning at work and couldn't get ahold of myself. I was prescribed 50mg of Zoloft. I hesitated if I should've cut the pill/dose in half for the first week to slowly increase but I just figured my case and anxiety was bad enough so I took 50mg right away. The first week of Zoloft was complete and utter HELL. My anxiety/panic got 10 times worse and I could barely function. I had extreme insomnia and when I did sleep_ I'd have really odd_ vivid dreams,F,19,9  days50 MG 1X D,8/20/2014Email,Zoloft

Upped the dosage to 150mg and I feel wonderful. Anxiety_ panic and depression and general apathy is gone. I avoided talking to people and didn't want to leave the house. This happened so slowly and gradually I didn't even notice. Now that I'm back to normal_ thanks to zoloft I can see how bad I was. It has literally given me my life back.

Talk about night and day difference! 75mg must have been the sweet spot- I no longer questioned the meaning of life_ and began to find beauty in the day-to-day like I had as a child. I am now so happy_ and look back on that period with sadness- Thank the Lord I was encouraged by friends and family to seek help through a SSRI's.,Praise God for medacine,F,29,3  years75mg 1X D,7/13/2014,Zoloft

126, 3, Anxiety and depression,Severe nausea_ headaches_ increased anxiety at 50mg.,"I have read a lot of the comments here but since I'm a senior citizen (73)_ I thought other seniors might be interested in my input.  Unfortunately_ I have suffered from anxiety for many years. I have tried quite a few SSRI's but the side effects outweighed any benefits.  I am leery of the ""benzos"" but am presently taking .5 mg of Klonopin.  My doctor now wants me off of it so I started on 25mg Zoloft. I had very few side effects (some nausea) so after about 3 months he decided to bump it to 50mg. Now I have headaches and have experienced some agitation and added anxiety which I don't need!  He then told me to back it off to 37.5mg and see how I do.  It may be that I can't take this SSRI either.  I think it is more difficult at my age to take these meds.  Your body assimilates medication differently when you get older.  We'll see what happens but this is definitely not what I hoped for in my ""golden years"".

130, 3, Sleepless_ mood swings/depression,Initially headaches_ nausea.,"I took Zoloft for roughly two years_ 50mg -which started at 25mg for first month.  There were good points and bad points equally. The drug left me feeling very satisfied on a day to day basis.  I took Zoloft right before bed with two glasses of water. I was sometimes happy to nearly manic upon awakening in the AM. I was also taking a very low dosage of Trazodone_ which was 25mg_ for sleep.Though Zoloft did help with depression_ sleep_ anxiety_ there were severe headaches as well as brain ""zaps""_ both while on the drug and also coming off of it. I try to block it out_ but easing off of Zoloft with nothing else to help ease the withdrawal symptoms_ was train wreck. Everyone should be aware of that aspect.In the end_ 50mg wasn't enough and I was already ""worn out"" of the initial help it created.  I didn't want to up the dosage to 100mg or higher because I was concerned with my lack of motivation and ambitiousness.

The first thing I noticed was that I was not getting angry anymore at little things that would set me off into a near-rage. I am calmer_ think more clearly_ and am not bothered by things in life that used to make me blow up. Another effect of the medication is that I no longer get sad or cry.

147, 1, Depression,,Last entry: I have been off Zoloft for more than ten years. The anxiety (inability to sit or lay still) and insomnia I started to experience shortly after starting the medication never went away; every doctor I complained about the side-effects to insisted Zoloft should treat that and would try to up to my dosage_ as far as 200 MG. After a good doctor finally took me off citing the possibility of seizure if I continued to take it_ it took years_ and my near being suicidal and checking myself into the hospital several times before a suitable treatment was found. I had doctors actually recommend I start with Zoloft again. I was appalled. When I moved to Spain in '07_ I went to see a physician and explained what my symptoms were and the first thing she asked_ knowing I was American_ was if I had ever taken an SSRI. I said yes_ how much_ which one_ for how long and when. She said nothing more and started me on a benzodiazapine regimen that I'm still on to this day_ six years later. I take alprazolam_ 2 MG three times a day now.

What happens to one person won't necessarily happen to the next.  I was scared to start taking Abilify due to being nervous about side effects.  I'm doing great_ you never know until you try it.

I remember the first four days on the drug were weird:  I felt jittery and a little elated_   rather like the opening to a hallucinogenic drug.   But that subsided very soon.    As everyone knows_    you have to give the drug about a month before you decide you might cycle off it;   people who decide after a week that ""it's not for them"" are really not using the drug correctly.      I will say that withdrawal from Zoloft (or any SSRI) is a very unpleasant experience:  severe mental confusion_   and objects in your peripheral vision seem to dance about_  wheel  and lurch unexpectedly  (not unlike the ""tracers"" of LSD).  You seem to ""miss"" seconds of time.

Before this medicine_   I could sink...and sink...   and sink into depression_   seemingly without end.

164, 3, Depression Anxiety,I started it at age 12. I noticed a difference in my anxiety and depression. I started at 10mg. My Doctor said I was going through the honeymoon phase_ so he upped it to 25mg_ and then 50mg to 100mg where I'm at now. I find it helps my depression somewhat_ but not my Anxiety. I feel tired and like I'm wasting away. Not sure how to explain but I think you get the point.

165, 3, Depression/Severe Anxiety Disorder,Trouble sleepingLoss of appetite completely Unable to orgasm/Complete loss of sex driveMood swings,"Zoloft is the second antidepressant ive tried so far. I definitely noticed a change with my anxiety_ but have also had a lot of down falls. I never know what mood im going to wake up in the next day_ and the mood changes are so erratic. Even if nothing bad has happened to put me in that bad mood_ or  its so minor that i shouldnt be flying off the handle over these things the way i do. Some days i found myself feeling on top of the world and the next i cant bare being alive a second longer. I ask myself  if the advantages are worth all the downfalls.Still am unable to work_ or clearly my problems are much worse then ""depression and anxiety"" hahaha.  Also_ to my own extreme idiocy i was feeling like shit the other day and decided to get completely wasted even though is says very clear on the bottle 'Do not drink with alcohol"" and ended up acting like an absolute lunatic_ putting myself and significant other in jail.  So really_ lesson learned the hard way_ dont drink like a tank_ trash your own place and absolutely everything you own_ and basically fuck up your life in every other way possible like i did_ word.",F,22,4  months50 1X D,7/7/2013Email,Zoloft

I have extreme reactions to meds so I tried a very small dose (used liquid version) in the morning and it made me drowsy and somewhat nauseous..I also got a horrific headache that day.  Still not sure if it was the Zoloft that caused it.  I waited a few days and decided to try the drug again..this time at bedtime and a smaller amount.  Although I slept good I could hardly get going the next morning and had drowsiness_ diarrhea_ and nausea all day.  I went to the store to see how I would function and had such severe mental confusion I could hardly function.  I won't ever take it again!  A day after taking it still dealing with the digestive issues and confusion along with a low mood.  Worst med I've ever taken.

The doctor reduced my dosage and the headaches seemed to subside after a week or so but then returned. I didn't see any major improvements in my mood so I asked to be taken off the drug. I had to slowly reduce the amount I took. The experience of coming off this drug was also not pleasant. Lots of headaches_ hand tremors_ sweating_ and nausea.

I've had to live with a photo in the yearbook and graduation pictures depicting me looking like a blimp for the last ten years. It also never helped my depression. When I decided to stop taking it_ I quit cold turkey and experienced some mild discomfort_ but it went away within a few days. My weight dropped down to 160 lbs. without me changing anything in my exercise routine or eating habits_ proving to me that it was the Zoloft that made me gain.

I was severly depressed and breast-feeding my son so this was the only option I had at the time (it is considered safe for nursing babies).  I struggled with the decision to take it because I was so worried that it may harm him because it does pass into breast milk in tiny amounts.  Then I condidered not breastfeeding and taking an antidepressant.  After much thought_ I decided that the benefits of nursing outweighed the negligable risks of the meds.  And_ to not treat the depression would have been plain stupid.  I was VERY depressed.  Also_ I was working full-time and pumping milk at work so that he could be exclusively fed breast milk for 4 months.  Well_ I may as well have not taken anything as it did not help at all.

Stomach had a rough time tolerating it.  Quit it one time cold turkey and ended up with very bad stomach problems.  Rapid weight gain but was probably from my appetite coming back.,I took this drug from the time I was 17 to 18 years old.  Excellent drug for getting me out of the three month depression I was in.  I had never been depressed before and high school started to suck so it hit me.  It took a few weeks but worked really well once it kicked in.

The first 2 weeks on thia drug were hell_ and I really thought I was going crazy_ but when I called my dr. She said I had probably gone through the worst of it and to continue if I could.  Thank God I stuck it out because every single side effect_ except the sexual went away after a month and my depression and anxiety cleared up completely.  Also got rid of a life long problem with insomnia.  My advice is increase and decrease dose VERY SLOWLY which unfortunately a lot of practioners don't know.  Also_ this drug is completely safe for nursing mothers_ as I read the actual studies.,F,35,2  years25 mg 1X D,5/22/2012Email,Zoloft
229, 5, Shocked by 220 Volt Wall Heater,I began taking Zoloft over 7 years ago for Anxiety_ Depression_ OCD.  Zoloft has been a great medication for me throughout the years_ however in November of 2010_ I was shocked by a 220 volt wall heater.  I knew that something wasn't right with my brain the next morning.  I had severe memory loss.  I was dazed_ confused_ anxious_ unable to talk to people or even compose an e-mail.  I didn't know what was wrong with me_ only that something wasn't right.  It has taken me almost 1.5 years to recover from this shock that went through my fingers and up my arm.  I had to try all sorts of other anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications to try and regain how my brian use to function before I was shocked.  What I realized about these drugs is that they all made me feel weird_ false feelings that weren't really real.  Every week I was at the Psychiatrist office.  The shock had put me into a very deep depression_ one I had never experienced before. Over the past 1.5 years I have tried Lorazap,,F,38,7  years25-100MG 1X D,5/21/2012Email,Zoloft
230, 4, Anxiety,decreased sex drive_ drowsiness,This med has helped me tremendously.  I was having horrible anxiety and I wasn't happy with the way xanax made me feel.  It just kind of temporarily suppressed the feeling rather than making it go away completely.  So the first two weeks I still had anxiety attacks.  But_ it gradually got easier every day after that.  I have noticed that if I miss one day_ the anxiety starts to creep back in_ so I have to make sure I take it regularly.  I take mine at night_ right before bed because I noticed I had a little dizziness when I initially took it.  But_ by the time I wake_ I feel fine.  It is harder to wake up so to say on that note...but nothing a cup of coffee can't cure.  Another perk is that I was able to take this while pregnant (I was very skeptical).  My OB insisted everything would be just fine and they are.  I have a healthy 5 month old and I haven't had any issues.,F,26, 75mg 1X D,5/21/2012,Zoloft

It helped tremendously with my excessive worrying and repetitive thoughts_ but did not help so much with my OCD (binge eating primarily). I became extremely fidgety and had flare ups with compulsively picking the skin on my hands. I could not stop this unwanted behavior and it was not getting any better as time progressed. I had to stop taking Zoloft and am currently in withdrawal (very dizzy). I would recommend weaning yourself off carefully_ especially if you've been taking this medication for a long time.

The others don't seem to help as much.  This one so far has had the least amount of side effects.  The first few weeks I had some brain fog_ but that has cleared up.  I still do get more tired than usual_ but I was also more tired than usual w/ the depression.  This has lifted the depression and made me more calm and not as irritable.  I am alot more tolerant on this med than without.  Its definately in my opinion the best SSRI.,F,32,4  months40mg 1X D,3/17/2012,Zoloft

It was like my heart was jumping out of my chest. I stop having sexual desire immediately and was very hard to feel any pleasure_ my organs got numb! It also made me sick to my stomach every time I took it for about 1/2 hour. I woke up super early around 4-5 am. and would be exhausted the whole day.,I decided to stop taking it even before I saw my doctor cause I could not take the side effects anymore.

Panic subsided and my thinking is clearer. The first few weeks were horrific though. I ended up in emergency twice due to constant panic attacks and was given Xanax to counteract them. I had suicidal thoughts and wanted it all to be over. Thankfully zoloft is now working for me. It does take time to work though and you need to stick it out.,,F,30,7  weeks100mg,2/20/2012,Zoloft

253, 1, Panic attacks,It was my 95 year old mother who was put on this drug.  She had been taking Xanax for 10 years for panic_ but the doctor switched her to Zoloft.  She had been fine for her age walking and talking and reading_ but as soon as she was put on a minimal dose of Zoloft_ she became very sleepy and dizzy and was having a difficult time walking.  I told the doctor the bad side effects_ but after a few weeks he doubled her dosage and she began to hallucinate and could barely communicate and was then confined to a wheelchair.  The doctor then added risperdal because of the hallucinations which she never had prior to taking Zoloft. She never walked again and was dead in 6 months.,If you have bad side effects and the doctor won't listen find a new doctor.,F,95,6  months 2X D,1/28/2012,Zoloft

Muscle painsleg spasm_ agitation_ anxiety_ tiredness_ sleep disturbance and more.,My wife was diagnosed with anxiety and diagnosed with depression. Although the Dr put her on zoloft 100mg to start_ when she had anxiety attack and suicidal thoughts the Dr increased the dose. this became 150mg. Then a friend of ours died and the dose was increased to 200mg. the problems kept occurring. On top of this my wife was injured in a workplace accident and was on pain killers. She became even more agitated and anxious and started drinking heavily and smoking. She became very self centred unable to function during the day properly and had problems sleeping at night. Her sex drive just shut down one day never to be seen again. Doc maintained everything was fine and she would adjust. It wasn't and she didn't. I managed to get her to reduce the dose. By this time she seemed to become manic spent a fortune_ went to hypnotist and gave up smoking. Hypnotist did a good job unfortunately maybe to good as he also helped her to become more emotionally controlled. Good for someone with problems already. It's taken three months for her to get to 100mg. Unfortunately a little to late. She has just moved out. Doesn't feel like being married anymore. Warning apparently some SSRI's can have adverse effects obviously everyone new what they were except the doc. Wife still not convinced despite the fact she has now seriously damaged the relationship with the kids_ her sister_ brother in law and obviously myself.

I did not suffer from sexual dysfunction.,I am discontinuing zoloft because I am hoping to get pregnant.  I would like to still be taking it because it really helps my mood and outlook.  Life just feels easier on zoloft.  Before_ I was so depressed and would often obsess about a certain problem.  The zoloft took the edge off and I was actually able to think about other things and be happy for a change!!!  I was nervouse prior to taking because of things I read on here.  But_ I must say_ zoloft has worked wonders for me.  And_ as far as withdrawal_ things are going very smoothly.

It was like taking a vacation from the sadness.  Then one day I realized I didn't feel anything.  I wasn't sad_ but I wasn't happy either.  Nothing really bothered me_ but nothing excited me that much.  I felt no emotional reaction to anything.  This scared me because it happened slowly so it took me a while to notice.  In the time it took for me to notice I had failed my entire first semester of college_ because I didn't care.  Even when I was depressed I did better in school.

The first time I took Paxil about 9 years ago_ even on a small dose_ I was sent into another whole level of anxiety/depression I had never experienced before; very scary. I then took the others to try to get more normal_ with no luck. I then started taking Zoloft (2 years after taking the Paxil) I finally stated to feel normal again. However_ by this time_ I had realized I had to start on a very_ very_ small dose. Also_ I had found out other family members had used this drug_ and has helped. This drug is not a miracle_ bur it did help me in my case. I stopped a couple years ago_ and have now started taking it again after falling back to where I was in my early 20s. This is one of the older drugs that has been around for awhile_ and has cheap generics if your insurance won't cover some of the newer expensive ones.

Approx. 8 hours after I took my first dose (which coincides with the peak of the medication in blood)_ I woke up with a racing heart. Two seconds later I figured it was a panic attack.  Thank God that since I was nursing my baby I had  done some research on this medication and  found  that it peaks ~8 hrs after taking it. An ambulance took me to the local ER where I started having racing thoughts and suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. Due to this I was transferred to the local mental hospital_ which was the scariest experience of my life.This medication was the start of the most difficult time in my life.  After this I was given 12 other psych meds within a period of 4 months and was diagnosed with 4 different mental conditions.  I had paradoxical reactions to all 12 meds.  Finally thanks to the book ""Dying for a Cure"" by australian Rebekah Beddoe_ I realized that all my mental issues were simply a result of the medication.There is a great misunderstanding even within the psychiatric community that since antidepressants take 2-6 weeks to work_ their adverse effects (including paradoxical reactions) are not observed until the 2-6 weeks. However_ adverse effects can occur within the first few days or weeks upon starting a medication_ changing dose (up or down) or quitting the medication.

He indicated that lower doses were used to treat depression whereas higher doses were used to treat GAD and panic attacks.  Folks_ you have to take this medicine for a while before it kicks in.  I hate to see one-star reviews when the patient didn't even allow the medicine time to work.  It really took a good month (no missed pills) for this medicine to start working for me.  In the beginning_ I would clench my jaw and have some insomnia at night_ but I read that was rather common and it eventually went away after a couple of weeks.  I took Benadryl for the insomnia.  My doctor also Rx'ed me some Klonopin to use on days I feel the Zoloft is not enough_ however_ I haven't had to take any.I take my Zoloft around noon with food.  I started out at 25mg and titrated each week by 25mg until I got to 100mg.  I then added another 25mg about 2 weeks later.  This has been a great drug thus far.  I read that 47% of users have decreased libido/unable to achieve orgasm_ but I'm in the other 53 percentile this doesn't affect (yay).  I took Prozac years ago and no sex-drive whatsoever.If you've been Rx'ed Zoloft_ please give it time to work!

I started taking zoloft back then to help my mental state and eventually the doctors figured out I had gastroparesis. I was treated for both the physical & mental.

Other drugs and alcohol will change the reaction you get.  I sometimes think all is well and stop taking it and realize it's just complacency with everything.  Stressful situations would bother me so I take it again.  I can skip a day when things are fine.  I also take light dosage that I have learned works well for me.  Heavier dosages don't hurt but causes me to behave irrationally.     If I am working just a half cup of coffee and good food will keep me in high spirits all day.  If not then no caffeine.  I also take a half a percocet with it daily and it gets me going through the joint pains from work.  After 9 years of playing with drug's dosages and other meds affecting it and lots more I know how to use it properly.

I've battled with anxiety and OCD all my life but it had never spiked to the point where I was then. Without hesitation he told me I had generalized anxiety disorder and prescribed me Zoloft. I posted on here about 3 weeks after starting it and said that I was dissatisfied with it. I still am. After 4 months of taking it I feel so emotionless and numb that I don't know what to do with myself. I'm constantly exhausted. I wake up tired and go to bed tired. I even told my boyfriend at one point that I thought we needed to take a break because I was convinced that I felt no feelings towards him anymore. I've been with him almost a year. I kept trying to tell myself to wait it out- that it may just be me and not the medicine. But it's been 4 months of this hell and I just want my emotions back. Zoloft works well to pull you out of a slump_ but I'm out of my slump now. I've been going to a counselor and I'm much stronger in controlling my loop thoughts. The only thing holding me back now is this horrible drug. I'm going to start weaning off slowly and hopefully be completely off by the end of the summer. I would not recommend this drug.

Looking back now I wish I would have increased my dose.I was afraid to take more than 25 mg_ however_ I still think I was depressed and I could have been doing better with a higher dose all of those years.  Exercise is also great for depression.  It is proved to help depression and anxiety.  I also take fish oils every day high in DHA by a company called Carlson.  Fish Oils are know,I take my medication at night before bed.  That seems to work great for me.,F,37,6  years25 1X D,2/3/2011,Zoloft
314, 2, Depression,I became a zombie. No desire_ no feeling. Worst withdrawal EVER.,Sure_ I didn't cry so much while taking Zoloft - but I didn't laugh either.  I was zoned out.  All the passion and opinions were sucked out of me.  I had no desire... for sex_ fun_ involvement_ or having choices.  It was awful - I couldn't care about anything if I tried. The withdrawal was the worst of it by far_ however. Withdrawal from Zoloft turned me into a violent soul. I burned with rage for weeks with no relief.  I seethed with hatred toward everyone and everything. Inside my head_ I was screaming at every person I passed on the street because they were too close to me. I was not even like that before Zoloft. Luckily_ this effect wore off as my body adjusted_ which took about a month. One miserable_ miserable month.,F,25,5  years50 mg 1X D,1/30/2011,Zoloft

(Sertraline HCL) I don't know if the name brand would've worked better but since I have no insurance I couldn't afford it even if it did work. I tried Zoloft once before in my late teens and it gave me vertigo. My ""awesome"" wanna- play-Dr RN told me I didn't give it enough time for the pill to work. I'm sorry but I missed two days of work due to the side effects. It felt like a major hangover. I probably should've went to the hospital but again money plays an issue. I have read my side effects were common with the drug but seriously who wants to live like that just to feel a little happier? I don't. I've been off meds for a year and have done fairly well.

When I weaned my self off like the doctor told me how I cried and yelled at the drop of a hat. It is so hard to come off this drug. DON'T DO IT!,I started taking zoloft at a lower dose and then I increased. I started taking this because I lost a love one and then I fell into deep depression. I think once you get on it your body gets used to it and then that is why I felt that I needed to increase the dosage. PLEASE LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE DOCTORS DON'T TELL YOU WHEN YOU START TAKING THE MEDICINE! When you try and come off this medicine is horrible.

Zoloft (sertraline- I use generic) and Effexor have been the most successful for me personally but I hated the withdrawal or effects of Effexor. Zoloft is much better that way.

319, 1, PTSD,Psychosis_ Hallucinations_ Abject Terror_ Severe Paranoia_  Anxiety_ Akathisia_ Labile Affect,I am recovering from a head injury I got about four months ago.  My neurologist suspected that my life long (since age 16) PTSD was inhibiting me from healing faster and highly recommended this drug.  I took it although I was very reluctant to.  On the first few days I became extremely anxious and was unable to sleep for more than four hours or so each night.  I would randomly cry and suddenly giggle back and forth like that for a few minutes at a time for no reason.  I was supposed to take 25mg per day for 7 days and then increase it to 50mg a day.  After the fourth day of 50mg a night I complained about the severe anxiety_ sleeplessness and extreme emotional response to my doctor so she reduced my dosage to 25mg every other day.   That night I took none and the next night I took 25 mg.  That last night I lost touch with reality_ I heard and saw things that were not there and became extremely scared of everything_ including a light on a power strip and even my boyfriend who is my primary caretaker.  This drug is scary.  Brings worse fear than the actual experience that caused me to have PTSD.  My boyfriend thinks this drug should be illegal.

329, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ Panic Attacks,The first two weeks I was very very emotional. I also have diarrhea when ever I have a panic attack or become overly anxious for a period of two days or more to this day after two years (which for me is still often). Never miss more than two doses_ you will have withdrawals that can range from severe depression to bad panic attacks that you have to take a tranquilizer to calm back down. (though that could just be a return of my own condition and may not pertain to you),This drug is amazing. It does have some draw backs but those that I have experienced are manageable compared to how I was before taking the drug. Before Zoloft I was moody_ irritable_ irrational_ would have severe anxiety when in a room smaller than 25ft squared with more than ten people in it_ and was having panic attacks everywhere (home_ college classrooms_ restaurants_ in the car_ etc). I would suggest always ordering your refill of medication early so you don't have problems of running out and always talk to your psychiatrist if something feels wrong in any way_ they can always change the dosage_ medication_ etc to help you feel the way you deserve to feel. Just because I find the side-effects better than how I felt before I took Zoloft doesn't mean that it is a good choice for you and you can always talk to your psychiatrist about other medication options if you wish to. I wish you all the best... Dani,F,22,2  years200 mg 1X D,11/5/2010Email,Zoloft
330, 5, Depression caused by head injury,The side effects were pretty mild_ but I have to admit I never got up to the full dosage of 50 mg.  I only got up to 25 mg.  The side effects I experienced were decreased sex drive & arousal_ decreased appetite_ and alertness for about 4 hours after taking the med.,I was prescribed Zoloft because I suffered depression from a head injury from a car accident.  The Doctor felt my serotonin levels had been damaged from the head injury.  In the days that followed the accident I was crying non-stop for no apparent reason.  I also had problems staying alert during the day due to the head injury (mild traumatic brain injury.)  The Zoloft worked really well for me.  It gave me some alertness during the day and snapped me out of the depression really fast.  I have never previously suffered from depression_ so I had never taken any anti-depressants before.  I am very grateful for the Zoloft - it worked really well for me.  HOWEVER_ I am now going off Zoloft and I've had the lovely (haha) experience of withdrawal. It's been horrible!  The withdrawal symptoms consisted of a few days of anxiety_ rage and jitteriness.  Not fun.  I would definitely recommend this med for chemical depression_ but with the caution that it's good to know about the withdrawal so that you can plan for it (i.e. let people around you know.),F,39,4  months50 mg 1X D,11/1/2010Email,Zoloft

My  depression is not usually ""sad thoughts and crying""_   but rather manifests itself with oversleeping_  overeating_  and a mean_  cranky_  bitter  attitude towards everything.    Depression makes  thoughts a jumble_  a dark foggy cloud_  and it's hard to read literature (you keep re-reading the same passage over and over again).    ZOLOFT helps tremendously in clarifying my thoughts and reading ability.  It lifts the daily mood wonderfully.   One side-effect is a certain blunting of affect:  sure_  your lows are reined-in;  but also your joys and happiness and creative afflatus are also blunted.  The ""Shiny-Happy People"" syndrome.

I took Zoloft for OCD and Klonopin for panic attacks and to counter the ""caffeine"" effects of the Zoloft.  If I took Zoloft prior to going to bed_ upon just opening my eyes the next morning I'd go right into a terrible panic attack.  As I awoke_ I could feel my body start to tense up readying for an impending anxiety attack.  It was horrifying!  I started taking the Zoloft in the morning with Klonpin and then going to bed taking only Klonpin and no longer had morning anxiety attacks.  For the initial first few weeks I felt as though I was on loads of caffeine.  If I held out my hand_ you'd have seen it quivering.  That side effect subsided about three-four weeks in.

It must be done in the slowest manner possible.  When I went off it too fast I became so dizzy I could barely walk and my speech was slurred like a drunk.  I also had crying spells.

Had brain zaps and Restless Leg syndrome that affected the whole body causing a constant need to flex and move muscles. Had Muscle pain also_ diagnosed as Fibromyalgia_ I suspect that the muscle pain was a zoloft side effect.Decreased to 25mg for the past 5 years. Less effective for OCD_ some obsessive thoughts break through but can be tolerated. Anxiety is back but mild enough to ignore. Side effects much better. Restless leg syndrome only occurs at night_ and not every night. I can sit quietly and knit for long periods of time. No brain Zaps_ muscle pain much less.25mg gives me a tolerable balance of treatment and side effects.,It's been impossible for me to stop this drug. I can decrease it slowly but when I get down to half of a 25mg pill I can't seem to get lower. I've tried shaving off tiny bits of the pill over 2 week intervals but my body seems hyper sensitive to the decreases. I get a recurrence of OCD and anxiety_ with the addition of anger_ depression paranoia and irrational thinking that make me impossible to live with. The symptoms are worse than they ever were before I ever took Zoloft. Once I decided to simply stop it at the 12mg point and tough it out. I ended up in the hospital-- a psychotic episode. Worse than anything I ever had before Zoloft.,F,60,18  years25 mg 1X D,6/18/2010,Zoloft
359, 3, Moderate Anxiety and panic attacks,Slight dizziness a couple of hours when first taking it_ frequently desiring for short rests throughout the day. Slightly harder to orgasm.,My doctor gave me 25mg of zoloft to start with because I began having severe anxiety and frequent panic attacks. The 25mg did lessen the encroaching day to day anxiety a bit_ but I was still far too anxious for comfort. After a while my dosage was upped to 100mg which has lowered my day to day anxiety by a moderate amount. I have had few side effects_ but I have noticed that if i miss a couple of doses I tend to get into crying fits about my anxiety. I still have panic attacks_ but they are much less frequent.,M,20,4  months100 MG 1X D,6/16/2010,Zoloft

Long term effects (noticed since trying to wean 5 years ago) include tinnitus_ muslce/joint pain_ fatigue_ cognitive dysfunction including memory loss_ headaches_ GI issues.,I have been on one SSRI or another for almost 20 years for anxiety and depression secondary to anxiety. I am currently on Zoloft and have made 4 attempts at weaning down SLOWLY in the past 5 years. I would seriously caution anybody who has anxiety and/or mild depression to not take SSRI/SNRI's lightly.

363, 2, depression,Anger_ a desire to do something bad to someone_ lash out at other people.,This drug made me feel angry like I wanted to hurt someone.  I had been going to the local Mental Health Center_ they prescribed it_ when I started feeling angry I went back to tell them I didn't like the way I was feeling_ but they didn't want to hear that.  They wanted me to keep taking it_ said if I was level_ that was what mattered.  At the end_ they put me with an old doctor who looked 80_ all he wanted to talk about was a list of herbal medicines I'd given them at the start as some I'd used.  When I tried to talk about the anger_ he brushed me off_ went back to the glucosamine/chondroitin_ Echinacea_ St John's Wart_ said I should never take anything an MD had not prescribed.  I tried to tell him I wasn't taking any of them right then_ & that they were sold thru drugstores_ he wouldn't listen.  I gave up in disgust.  I went off Zoloft myself & started feeling better within a week.  The anger went away.  ,F,54,5  monthsDK 1X D,6/2/2010Email,Zoloft

Low and slow is the way to do it. Most dr.s want to give you high doses to hurry up and get well. That's not always better. Dangerous_ in fact. He wants me to be on 100mgs! But 25mgs made me a bit more anxious and weakness in limbs. I have found my theraputic dose is about 18mgs daily. Now I don't have any side effects_ but it was sorta rough the first few months. But I had panic attacks really bad and this has helped a lot actually. It also has helped some with OCD. It helps take the edge off. I take the generic. Haven't had to use my Xanax for awhile except for occasional insomnia. I do get restless legs sometimes as I try to fall asleep. The weakness in limbs is either better or I am used to it. Can't tell. Odd. Overall_ this seems to be a good SSRI and would compare it to Lexapro. I have only gained about 3-4 pounds in the past 7 months and that's just because I am more relaxed and my body isn't burning the food up from anxiety.

Sex drive not much diminished. Not gained any weight and rarely need sleeping meds any more. So far so good !,I think an improvement on FLUOXETINE which I took for ten years until it pooped out. I still have some obsessional anxiety but combined with CBT I think this drug works well even on a very small dose.

At that time_ I found that it rapidly pulled me out of depression and eased my insomnia until I built a tolerance to that dose and had to have it increased again. Nowadays_ they call that SSRI ""poop-out"" and will lower_ then increase your dose_ as opposed to putting you on higher and higher doses until you are above the therapeutic level (as my psychiatrist did with me). At the time I never experienced sexual side effects or noticed that my dreams were unusual. I slipped back into a deep depression in June and went back on Zoloft this July. It was honestly a lifesaver. I was no longer irritable_ labile_ anxious_ or irrational. I finally got back into a normal routine of sleeping_ and I lost all interest in alcohol (it seems I like to self-medicate when I'm depressed). There were other positive changes too. I felt calm_ optimistic_ and smiled all of the time. Unfortunately_ I gradually lost all interest in sex. I am in the process of tapering off this medication and introducing remeron_ which is notorious for causing extreme weight gain. Fat and horny_ or thin and asexual.

Extended side effects: jaw clenching (this was a weird_ unexpected reaction)_ extremely vivid dreams_ intense withdrawls if dose is missed more than two days.,Zoloft has turned my life around_ though I can see it not working for other people. The jaw clenching took me by surprise_ and it's been odd working on avoiding it. The dreams don't bother me so much_ but for others that could be undesirable. I am a completely different person since I started this drug_ all in a good sense. It's not to easy to get on to_ but if you can get past the jitters that it induces_ you should be fine. The only major problem I have with this drug is the withdrawl symptoms that occur if you miss your dosages_ or_ I assume_ while you're coming off the drug. If I go more than two days without taking it (forgetting_ unable to take it...)_ I experience severe weakness_ lightheadedness/nausea_ depression_ irritability_ impatience_ lack of motivation or interest_ and jitters. Other than that_ this particular drug has worked wonders for me; I'm happy for the first time since I was fourteen. Zoloft for me has been a way to get back on a level track_ and now that I'm in a good metal state_ I'm getting close to solving the problems that caused my depression in the first place_ and am moving closer to a point where I can come off the drug permanently.

I stopped using it because I felt like I had been cured but since then have had brief spells of depression that were as bad as anything I'd ever felt and I've come to appreciate what the drug did. The only reason I'm not rushing back to it is because_ in retrospect_ it definitely gave me what I think was a slightly counterproductive ability to tolerate negative situations. There were many situations that I look back on and think_ ""I handled that well and the drug helped."" But there were also situations that I handled terribly. While on the zoloft_ I was sexually harrassed by an older gay man and didn't do much to put a stop to it. Sometimes I think that_ if not for the zoloft_ I might have done something to stop the situation. Instead_ I just passively waited for him to eventually stop.Another thing I should mention is that it took a long time before  I noticed any change.

It was really scary. Also_ when on my correct dose_ if I forget to take it for more than one day_ I become very distressed - this reverts back the next day when I take it.  So_ pretty significant withdrawal effect in my view.,It did seem to reduce my PMS symptoms a little_ but still get quite depressed a week before my period.  I am no longer suicidally depressed for one week in a month which is a definite plus.  The jaw clenching and agitation are very unpleasant though - so bad that my dentist said I was starting to damage my teeth.  I now have to wear a mouth guard at night.  My doctor has recently suggested I try changing to Prozac as it is slow release and so may have less of an unpleasant kick and withdrawal effect.,F,36,2  years,11/25/2009,Zoloft
413, 2, mainly anxiety but also depression,slight acne_ teeth grinding_ vivid dreams,I started taking 50mg at night but it gave me insomnia so I switched to day. If I took it on an empty stomach it gave me unbearable heartburn. Zoloft made me feel numb_ I couldn't cry but I certainly wasn't happy. It might have slightly helped my anxiety but I can't say for sure. That's how small its benefits were. I am 5'4'' and weigh around 110 and luckily it did not cause weight gain (That was the side effect I was most concerned about). The only reason I stayed on zoloft for 3 months is b/c I had withdrawls when I tried to ween off of it including heart palpitations. I finally managed to get off of it but it wasn't easy. I so wanted zoloft to work for me but I guess my body just didn't react to it the way some people do.,F,21,3  months,11/24/2009,Zoloft

415, 4, Depression,Years ago stimulating at first. Had to go up very slowly at 12.5 mg_ then at 200 mg within a year. The only lasting side effect is some tiredness_ but that can coincide with the luteal phase of my menstrual cycle.,I take Curcumin with piperine to counteract the effects of amotivation and lack of motivation/sex drive. I cannot take SNRIs_ but curcumin with piperine and Zoloft makes me feel and think normally.

Total sexual dysfunction which has continued for six months with no improvement after stopping the medication.,Taking this drug was the worst decision I've ever made. Quite simply this medication has destroyed my life. Facing the possibility of a lifetime with no sexual enjoyment (and the impaired relationships this implies) has been devastating. Ironically I am much more anxious and depressed than before I took this drug.,F,28,6  days,11/19/2009Email,Zoloft

I am so glad that I started this med_ I feel more relaxed and even happy.  Everyone around me has noticed a difference as well.  I think that I may have to ask my dr. to up my dosage because I am still having a little anxiety_ though not nearly as much without the meds.,F,34,25  days,11/3/2009,Zoloft

Yesterday I was able to get out of the house to go to my sons soccer games_ thought I was getting better.  Today I am not doing well at all. How long does it take to get this drug into your system to start feeling a little bit of relief? I need to get back to work (which caused this in the 1st place).,M,40,10  days,11/1/2009Email,Zoloft
421, 1, Depression,Emotional numbness_ flatness,It didn't work. I was fifteen when my incompetent psychiatrist prescribed it. Started out at a low dosage. Nothing happened. He went on increasing it_ until I was taking 200mg a day of the stuff. No effect. Went right on being depressed and cutting myself. It did absolutely nothing for me. Quit taking it at eighteen and there was absolutely no difference.,F,32,3  years,10/29/2009,Zoloft
422, 2, Depression,nausea if I took on an empty stomach_ diarrhea after dosage increase which subsided after a month,Started off on 50 mg Zoloft daily and gradually increased to 150 mg.  Had about 1-2 weeks of feeling great on the 150 mg dosage (especially after the diarrhea subsided)_ and then suddenly symptoms returned.  Added buproprion 100 mg twice daily and symptoms greatly improved after 4 weeks (which is where I'm at now).,F,52,5  months,10/28/2009,Zoloft

424, 4, Depression,Sleepiness_ delayed orgasm_ withdrawal,When I first got on Zoloft it helped me tremendously. My suicide thoughts stopped right away_ and this helped me realize that it was the actual depression_ not me_ that caused these thoughts. Unfortunately it made me tired all the time. I could sleep a full 8 hours every night and still need to take a 3-4 hour nap in the afternoons. I also had an extremely difficult time orgasming_ which had never been a problem before. That was very frustrating and made me self-conscious in bed. The side effects were worth it for the increased quality of life_ though. After 2 years_ this drug is no longer working as well for me (I'm on 100 mg)_ and I'm going to try something else. The suicidal thoughts are still gone_ but that's the only good it's doing. I only went through withdrawal if I was off it for 2-3 days_ and then I got dizzy and light-headed.,F,22,2  years,10/14/2009,Zoloft

I went nuts because of Zoloft!,I had fought with depression for a few years on and off_ Nothing really bad. I was going through a really rough time and went to the Doctor. He gave me Zoloft_ After just a few days i noticed things were not getting any better. I called the doctor and he told me to stick it out for a few more days. A week or two after that I tried to kill myself. I went off the deep end totally. Never in my life have i felt that low until i started taking those pills. I was put in the nut ward for a few days Where they jacked up the dose and MADE me take it. I was on it a total of 3 weeks. When i got out i stopped taking it_ I had the worst withdraws EVER! The headaches and Brain jolts were HORRIBLE! It's been almost 3 years now since being off of it_ and still to this day i don't think my brain is right. These medications are VERY VERY dangerous! Please be cautious and READ EVERYTHING on them before taking! Remember your doctor does not know everything. He/She was given a license to PRACTICE medicine not to KNOW everything! Do research yourself people!,F,24,3  weeks,10/5/2009Email,Zoloft
427, 1, anxiety_ depression,tiredness_ jaw clenching_ intense dreams_ suicidal ideation,My anxiety decreased significantly and I felt a lot more motivated to do things_ but it didn't take long before I felt spacey all the time and felt disinterested in everything. Now I have to discontinue use because all I can think about is committing suicide. I had thoughts of suicide prior to beginning Zoloft_ but the drug has influenced me to have a certain emotional detachment so that I think these thoughts are somehow rational.,F,22,3  months,10/3/2009,Zoloft

I felt like ""me"" for the first time in several years.  However_ I had horrible diarrhea to the extent that I would set my alarm for 90 minutes prior to my normal waking time just to be sure it was all done with before I left for work.  After a month__ this effect had not abated.  With regard to a decrease in libido_ I found that if I concentrated a bit more_ everything worked fine_ but it did cause a delay in orgasm.  I've since switched to Lexipro.",M,48,6  weeks,9/17/2009,Zoloft
430, 5, Post-Partum_ Thoughts of doing Harm,"I had very mild euphoria following the first several doses of 25mg_ but not enough to really feel ""out of it"".When I miss a does or try to lower my dosage too fast I do experience the common ""zaps"" I've read others have experienced too.  The ""zaps"" are best described as an electrical sensation behind your eyes after suddenly moving them sideways.  (At first the zaps seemed more vague to me_ but I started paying very close attention and realised that it is my eye movements that causes them).","Zoloft has helped me tremendously!  I really don't know where I would be right now without it.  I am a person who does NOT like to take medications or drugs of ANY KIND.  After I had my son I experienced severe PPD with intrusive thoughts of doing harm to him and myself_ so I made myself try a medication for him and I'm so glad I did.  I was very scared I would have side effects of feeling ""out of it"" or worsening of my symptoms_ but I had nothing like that.  I started on a low does of 25mg and then increased it as needed. One unique thing about this med is that is has a very short time to go into effect_ so when you start it_ i think you feels it's benefits faster than with most other SSRIs & same when you stop it or lower the does too. Having thoughts of hurting or killing someone is the scariest thing ever - the way my doctor explained it to me is that_ in humans_ just like we can feel suicidal when depressed sometimes we can feel homicidal too. This helped me forgive myself a bit by being reassured that it was due to the imbalance of chemicals in my brain and that finding the right medicine could help.  If you have thoughts like this I would strongly reccommed this medicine from my own personal experience.  I have been told that medication is the most effective way to treat these kinds of thoughts_ although counseling is helpful also - you won't feel so isolated like you're the only one harboring all these awful secrets of what goes on in your head",F,25,3  years,9/15/2009,Zoloft

Insomnia was horrid the first 2-3 days_ not sleeping but 2-3 hours each night.  Other than that_ nothing - until week 3 when I all of the sudden experienced moderate nausea/vomiting and pretty good dizziness constantly.  Also_ about a 5 lb. weight loss in the 3 weeks I took it.  Decreased appetite.,"I'm disappointed.  I debated and debated whether to try an anti-depressant and finally decided to go with Zoloft because I am nursing my 1 year old.  I decided at this point the potential risk to my daughter was outweighed by my extreme mood swings/impatience/anger in general towards my kids.  I started low_ 25 mg's the first 7 days_ then increased to 50.  The first couple of days were rough with the insomnia but when that cleared up I felt fine_ like I wasn't taking anything.  It wasn't until the 3rd week that I started to feel as though I had the flu.  I went to the dr. and he said no way could it be the Zoloft_ said I had the stomach flu.  Well_ this lasted for 7 full days and I stay home with my 3 small children_ it wasn't working!  Today_ I decided enough and did not take it.  So far_ no ""withdrawal"" effects but I'll be darned if I feel great.  No nausea/dizziness like I experienced yesterday and the 7 days prior.  I really wanted this to work and I do think it mellowed me out a bit_ I wasn't so on edge_ so jumpy and moody and irritable.

He also was more paranoid.,"After more research and doc appts. we've learned there's a high chance my son has early onset bipolar disorder.  Drugs like Zoloft and other SSRI's (ex. Prozac) will cause bipolar-like children to become aggressive_ bouncy_ violent and affect their thoughts.  Please be careful giving this to your child if you suspect they have more of a ""mood-based"" disorder.  If they haven't been diagnosed with a mood disorder but placed on a drug like Zoloft and respond similarly to how my son did_ please call your doc right away and discuss the possibility of a mood disorder.

472, 1, Clinical Depression,Suicidal ideation_ weight gain_ suicidal tendencies_ tingling fingers_ dizzy_ tremor_ insomnia,I was given zoloft from my pyschiatrist and started at 50mg per day and was steadily increased to 100mg.  After taking this for three weeks I began to not process thoughts well and found it difficult to concentrate and function well.  I felt very shakey in my hands especially in the afternoons making tying a bow or a knot very difficult.  I found work hard to focus on and suffered some memory difficulties.  I was carrying out 'risky' behaviours and after 4 weeks of taking it I ended up in the emergency department of the hospital twice in 4 days for over-dosing.  This medication has not been at all pleasant and when put in hospital the doctors increased my dose to 150mg and this was terrible.  I am now on my first complete day with taking no zoloft after slowing decreasing the dose and the withdrawal isn't pleasant but survivable so far.  Headache_ slight confusion_ temperature and feeling very tired are some of the withdrawal symptoms I have so far felt but they are better than what zoloft was doing for me. Zoloft was prescribed to me to help with depression and if I knew that there were reported cases that this anti-depressant could increase the risk of suicide I NEVER would have agreed to take the medication. I have learnt that it is very important that you should ask your doctor questions when they prescribe you a medication and that it is essential to research the side effects. I had never previously carried out any risky suicidal behaviours until after taking zoloft for 3 weeks.,F,28,2  months,5/30/2009,Zoloft

I never had a weight problem before this.  When I first began taking the drug_ I did have a few other side effects_ but they only lasted a few weeks.  Dry mouth and constant thirst were the negative ones (that only lasted 3-4 weeks_ then went away)_ and_ oddly enough_ weight loss was the positive one (I lost about ten pounds_ but obviously it all came back_ and more.),IMPORTANT---I was prescribed Zoloft by a psychiatrist after a thorough psychological exam.  I go in for a re-check every three months.  Having a psych professional regularly monitoring my mental health care has been the reason_ I believe_ for my success with Zoloft.  If you are having problems with Zoloft_ and have not consulted with a psychiatrist_ you may want talk with one about your treatment.

After much research on google (look for yourself) the differences in the generics are this.  Check with your pharmacy.  If they use the pharmeceutical company TEVA_ then you SHOULD NOT use this generic.  Teva has had several lawsuits filed because it was found that they do not use the proper amount ingredients in their meds.  CVS pharmacy uses Teva.  Greenstone is the sister pharmaceutical of Pfizer and has an excellent reputation and their generics are 100%.  Rite-Aid uses Greenstone and I get my generic zoloft and xanax from them and they both work the same as the name brand.

I originaly had taken Paxil 20mg twice daily for the last 10 years.  I do plan on having children so my doctor did advise me Paxil is not safe to take while pregnant according to studies that have been done.  I am in the titration process of slowly taking away the Paxil and slowly adding the Zoloft.  I really do think the Zoloft is beginning to work even better than the Paxil.  With all medications you have to give it time but sometimes that just gets frustrating.  I am sure many of you can relate to me on that statement.  My doctors goal is Zoloft 150mg daily instead of Paxil 20 mg twice daily.  If anyone has any comments to share I am up for them since I have taken Paxil for so many years and you get a little uncomfortable when changing medications.,F,32,9  days,1/17/2009Email,Zoloft

I've gained seven unwanted pounds in almost four months of taking this medicine.,I started this for anxiety and yes it helped but I'm concerned about the weight issue.  I went from an 8 to a size 10 in three months and that is not too pleasant at all.  I cut my dose in half at the point that this weight gain happened (all in ten days time at the 90 day point) I am still doing ok with the anxiety and I must say that Zoloft has helped me sleep without any 'help' for the first time in many years.

You just feel normal_ no severe high or low and thats quite nice. Whats interesting though is I used to take the brand name which gave me severe ejaculation delay (30min-1hr longer than normal) but I have been on the generic for awhile and the generic does not do this to me whatsoever (no delay with generic at all_ normal range).,M,30,7  years,12/27/2008Email,Zoloft

532, 1, Inattention to Detail,,I had taken Zoloft for several years and Ive been incomparably better off without it.  As for psychiatry_ no known scientific diagnosis has ever been issued.  And the legitimacy of prescribing treatment (with harmful side effects) without a properly diagnosed illness is questionable at best.Instead of costly drug treatment of symptoms_ consider choosing natural cure and prevention.  In any case_ most health problems can be cured and prevented with a healthy vegetarian diet_ herbal teas_ clean vitamins_ and lifestyle that doesnt oppose the laws of nature.

The headaches are awful and I've never been unable to orgasm on SSRI's until Zoloft_ which is frustrating.  I DID_ however_ lose some of the weight that I gained on Paxil and Lexapro!

Here's where I have to warn you.  I went through 3 WEEKS of HELL getting off the Zoloft.  I couldn't stand up without getting dizzy.  I had (and still have sometimes) these weird zings in my brain.  Like someone is shocking my brain directly.  With a Taser (don't tase me_ bro). If I turn my head too quickly_ it's like my eyes can't keep up_ and I see strobing tracers.  And there was the insomnia.  And the muscle spasms.  And the crying. And the murderous rage.  Oh_ and the original anxiety was back_ too. Needless to say_ I was and am ANGRY.  I weaned totally off in 2 weeks_ and didn't take ANY more zoloft_ which was very stubborn since it might have helped to wean even more slowly (i.e. go to 25mg_ then down_ etc...).  I did not want any more of that vile_ evil substance in my body.

I was having terrible depressive episodes so when i went to the p-doc they put me on drugs. i was on wellbutrin 100mg originally and it made me have severe mood swings_ so they switched me to the Zoloft which was fine for 2 months but now i am expereincing more severe mood swings again.  I am also on a whole bunch of Omega3 and b-complex vitamins_ my p-doc is thinking he might take me off the Zoloft entirely until i am done nursing so i can go on a mood stabilizer instead of an antidepressant.,F,31,2  months,12/16/2008,Zoloft

542, 5, Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Night sweats,My GI doctor prescribed this drug (in conjunction with Seasonique) to help control my irritable bowel symptoms (both diarrhea and constipation with intense cramping which were tied to my hormone levels) and it has worked wonders.  I haven't experienced any IBS symptoms with the combination of Zoloft/Seasonique (which I have been on for about 6 months) and had only occasional symptoms when I was on Zoloft alone (for 1.5 years).  Before I was put on the meds I lost about 20 pounds due to all of the gastro issues and have since been able to return to a normal weight.  The only side effect I have noticed are night sweats.  I get them every night (typically a few hours before I get out of bed) and wake up covered in sweat.  It can get annoying but I'd much rather deal with sweating excessively than diarrhea.  Haven't noticed any difference in my mood since I'm on a low dose (50 mg).,F,24,2  years,12/4/2008,Zoloft

Makes me a little sleepy within 30 to 60 min of taking my once daily dose_ but not too bad.,Zoloft has helped somewhat with my panic disorder_ but did not help at all with my phobias.  I had to increase my dose all the way to 150mg per day to maintain benefit from taking the drug.  I was able to lower it back down to 100mg per day after adding Buspar to my line-up (at 15mg 3 times per day).  The Buspar helped me a great deal_ and I considered dropping the Zoloft_ but my doc thinks the combination of the two is responsible for my improvement so I have maintained the Zoloft at 100mg per day.  I would recommend trying Buspar first_ and then add the Zoloft if the Buspar is not enough.

551, 4, Depression and Anxiety,No libido at all_ weight gain_ not as passionate about things,Overall_ the benefits of Zoloft outweigh the side effects_ since I had anxiety problems (i.e. waking up in the middle of the night worrying about things out of my control_ feeling nauseous in public places that were crowded) and severe depression (suicidal ideations_ hopelessness_ lack of motivation).  Zoloft_ as well as therapy_ has helped me overcome these obstacles.  I just wish I hadn't gained so much weight on this medication (30 lbs in 3 years) and that I had a sex drive.  My doctor just prescribed me Wellbutrin to combat some of the side effects_ specifically the libido issue_ so I will see how the combination of the two works.,F,33,3  years,11/19/2008,Zoloft

I didn't get any sleep whatsoever. Falling asleep took hours and if I managed to_ I would wake up within the hour for another two hours_ so I just took it in the morning. It helped a good deal just being on it with my anxiety and triggers/flashbacks_ but it didn't seem like it was working for me as well as it's meant to. 75 didn't help much more than 50 at all_ in fact the difference was negligible. My stupid crazy psychiatrist then said oh let's bump you up until you start exhibiting side effects so up to 100 you go! then the shaking started.I would recommend the medicine for someone with PTSD who has problems with anxiety and flashbacks.,F,16,3  months,11/17/2008,Zoloft

I think the weight is due to the smoking cessation_ but I've been running about 3 miles every other day for a month and a half and I can't lose a single lb. It might be zoloft related.

It takes six weeks to take care of insomnia. I weigh 110 and take 100 mg/day if I want to sleep w/o xanax.  If I want to just get rid of the anxiety and ""usually"" fall asleep with out xanax_ I stay with 50 mg.  However_ I feel really depressed right now. I don't want to do anything!  I think we go through cycles_ picking between the evils...we get on an SSRI and forget how bad it was before we started on them. What do I do? Take Zoloft_ get great sleep_ but be lazy and gain weight? Or be skinny_ motivated & driven_ but anxious & irritable? Oh_ and NEVER fall asleep naturally!.

573, 4, panic attacks_ general anxiety,low sex drive; weight gain; not as passionate about life,Side effects decreased when i reduced zoloft from 150 to 100 mg. I truly believe Zoloft has made my life better. I used to wake up in the middle of the night worrying at least 5 nights a week. I had ulcers. I had panic attacks before dentist appointments. When I got angry at someone_ I felt like I would explode. All of that disappeared_ so to me_ it's well worth the side effects. It's nice to sleep and be able to deal with things rationally without worrying i'll have a panic attack or double over from stomach pains!,F,35,5  years,10/1/2008,Zoloft
574, 5, Depression_ Bi-Polar_ Anxiety,Dry mouth_ heightened side effects if more than one day's dose was missed (aggression_ agitation_ restlessness_ mood swings) but not severe enough to quit taking it long term.,I was on 100 mg for 3 1/2 years when it quit working as well as it had been.  It was still helping_ just not enough.  I was taken off Zoloft and put on Seroquel.  Big mistake!  I suffered from extreme aggression_ agitation_ mood swings_ and I was unable to feel peace or happiness.  I wound up cutting my arm 3 times and needed 31 stitches!  I suffered from a mental brake down after 5 weeks of being on the Seroquel and when I had to stay at a mental facility they put me back on Zoloft and increased my dose to 150mg.  I was like a new person!  I was the 'old'_ good me again and I have been better ever since.  If the Zoloft stops 'working' then increase your dose before trying something else and risk having an adverse reaction like I did.  Zoloft can be taken up to 350mg and still be safe_ so if it has ever worked for you_ please give a higher dose a try.,F,25,4  years,9/30/2008Email,Zoloft

Right about after lunch everyday I would start craving alcohol and I would start drinking right when I got home until I went to bed.  That went on for several months until I tryed to stop and had a panic attack.  I knew this was not normal for me so I stopped taking Zoloft in hopes that it might be the culprit.  I have not had a craving for alcohol since I stopped Zoloft.  I have a mostly full bottle of vodka in my cabinet right now and it can just stay there!,F,27,10  months,9/24/2008,Zoloft

It doesn't work right away_ but for me_ after two weeks to around a month of taking it_ I slowly began returning to normal. I started to feel more motivated_ and wanted to be around my friends again. I stopped wanting to sleep all day_ and I had an easier time meeting people. Today_ my life is so much better.

You will experience 24 hours or so of bizarre otherworldness when you start taking it_ and lose your appetite for a bit_ but it's OK_ just don't scare yourself by thinking it is unusual.,This works. For OCD patients like myself it apparently works much faster- a couple of days- than for those with depression. Remember_ OCDers_ that you cant rest on Zoloft to take care of you. You will drift back to your compulsions. You have to 'try' to relax as bizarre as that sounds. I only take 25 mg a day because my 50 mg dose makes me too groggy- and even 50 is a low dose. 200 is a possible dose for severe depression. I don't PMS as much when taking these. Remember when taking other drugs like MAOIs you can die combining them_ because they give you a serotonin overdose in combo. You can't drop LSD while taking Zoloft_ or do shrooms_ because Zoloft reins in the serotonin that such drugs throw out of whack in order to create their effect. If you wanted to take such a drug_ stop taking Zoloft for a week beforehand to clear it out (I believe a week is plenty). However_ if you're taking Zoloft for very serious depression or have significant lack of mental control_ don't take su,F,21,2  years,9/6/2008,Zoloft

If I didn't find a cure_ I surely would have ended my life_ it was that bad.  Within a month_ Zoloft improved my mood_ and cured the anxiety to the point that my then husband did not recognize me!  The change in me was so drastically positive_ that we were not compatable any more (misery loves company_ guess he was lonely).  He began to say that I didn't ""need"" the drug_ and it was a ""cop out_ and a crutch"".  Turned out what I didn't ""need"" was him and all his negativity!   Twelve years later and I am still taking Zoloft.  For me the benefits out weigh the side effects_ but they can be exasperating!

It took a couple of weeks for me to realize much of a difference with Zoloft_ but it has_ without a doubt_ saved my life. The only complaint I have is that I found myself eating more than usual which caused some weight gain_ but none that can't be managed without increasing exercise and eating healthier. I had some fatigue when first starting the prescription_ but I no longer notice it. Just make sure that you DO NOT go without Zoloft for more then a couple of days once you have been on it for awhile! The withdrawal is AWFUL!

I haven't needed to take a Xanax in a long time. Unfortunately_ the weight gain and sex drive issue is driving me crazy_ and I am considering switching to another drug because of this_ but it appears that the other SSRIs have the same issues.

I found another dr. who prescribed 100mg Zoloft.  The shocking thing for me is that Zoloft relieved 90 % of my fibromyalgia pain !!!  This is a HUGE thing for someone like me.

I started back on brand Zoloft on 4/7/08 and have had gone from 2-5 panic attacks a week to 2 in 3 weeks so I know it is helping the panic. Anxiety is still strong.

Benzo tranquilizers seem to change the effective dose.  I've taken  100 to 400mg. I think the high dose tolerance is due to the tranq. Reducing the tranq feels like increasing the Zoloft. Increasing the tranq feels like decreasing the Zoloft.",The drug changed my life for the better. It was literally a cure for debilitating anxiety_ obsessive worry and social phobia. BUT dose changes have to be managed CAREFULLY! The discontinuation syndrome lasted almost a year before I was forced to go back on & reduce properly. I've learned how to manage my dose without any ill effect using adjustments of 12.5mg (break a 25 tablet) every 2 weeks. The drug is fantastic_ but improper fluctuations in dose can cause serious! mood issues. Do your homework or call your dr. before changing your dosage.,F,42,16  years,4/14/2008,Zoloft

I had this attitude and frustrating aire about me that seemed to bring everyone around me down.  I finally decided something needed to be done since I wasn't making any progress on my own.  Started at 25mg went to 50mg after first few days.  Already_ my moods seem to be more stable and I feel better emotionally.  Sex drive decreased some_ but that wasn't necessarily bad; I've always had a high sex drive so the meds may put my wife and I on the same level sexually.

Problem was_ I had major trouble with sexual dysfunction.  :-( Libido was still there_ but sensation was gone and I couldn't orgasm anymore AT ALL.  I felt like someone turned off a light switch in me so that sex felt like nothing. Tried decreasing the dose to 25 mg_ which remedied the sexual issues for the most part but caused my depression/anxiety to retun.  Decided to try a switch to Wellbutrin.

I had never_ ever_ pondered suicide before taking Zoloft.  The first two days on Zoloft_ I felt_ among many other nasty side effects_ but this being the most important to stress here_ an unnatural drive to harm myself.  One can only imagine if I weren't mentally stable enough to talk myself out of committing suicide!  Additionally_ Zoloft made me feel ""dull"" and ""blah"".  It numbed my feelings and caused me to sleep a lot - which worsened my depression because I was sleepy all day thus unproductive.  I contantly craved junk food_ so I think I would've gained a lot of weight.  So I only took Zoloft 50mg for one month_ and then my doc switched me to Wellbutrin XL 300mg in the morning daily.

The only side effect that was beneficial was the suppression of my emotions because_ well_ I don't really feel anything negative (it's hard to feel positive_ too_ but not quite as difficult).  When I started taking Zoloft I wasn't really eating that much_ so I initially blamed my weight gain on returning to a normal caloric intake (I gained 15 pounds within a few months of starting Zoloft_ but I also began eating a normal caloric intake).  I recently discovered I have now gained over 30 pounds since being on Zoloft while exercising and eating a normal_ healthy diet (and_ the really strange thing is_ I wasn't unusually hungry_ just eating normally).

My libido has actually improved on Zoloft_ perhaps because I am no longer clinically depressed. Zoloft is an SSRI but slightly works on dopamine as well and I think that might give it some advantages over other SSRIs in regard to energy_ motivation_ etc. 30 minutes of continuous excercise at least five days per week also contributes to SSRI-like mood improvement_ which I do.

My brain has shut down and can not function on its own.  I am now on a different medication to help the damage done to my body from this drug.  Its not worth it!,F,26,6  years,7/20/2007,Zoloft
731, 5, Emotional Instability,I have taken a lot of ssri's over the last 35 years but this is the only one that works without any noticable side effects. It helps with ED also. I take generic_ 50mg but buy 100mg tabs because the price is the same. I used to take brand zoloft until generic came out_ I can tell no difference in the two.,Congrats to Pfizer Inc. You got it right this time.,M,60,3  years,7/18/2007,Zoloft
732, 3, depression,Sex drive went way down the drain_ and so did sensation. It happened over a couple of months_ not noticing any change in the beginning_ but then slowly had a harder time orgasming and having less and less desire to have sex.,DON'T take this if you want a good sex life!!!,F,27,6  months,7/15/2007,Zoloft
733, 5, Depression,Libido is decreased. This is a difficult med. to start as weird side effects ranging from head aches to 'whirring brain' effects and restlessness.  I found they are minimal when increasing dosage by only 25mg at a time. It took months to settle in with this drug but it was so worth it.  Dr.s do not understand the crazy side effects of starting this class of drugs and often move patients too quickly thru increases.,Zoloft is amazing for me.  I have learned how to raise and lower the dosage with the seasons/ light changes here in the north.  I go from 200 mg in winter to 125 in the summer. I tried Celexa at one point but it caused memory problems right away. I wouldn't give up this drug for anything but you have to understand that small improvements occur across several months and you have to hang in there for the long haul.,F,46,14  years,7/14/2007,Zoloft

736, 3, Panic Attacks,Lathargicness_ weight gain.,Stay off this unless you want to be a zombie for the next 5 years. My mom didn't even recognise me I gained so much weight. Total attitude change. Nothing could make me remotely angry. I could have found my wife in bed with my Dad and laughed about it. Thank God that never happened. :),M,34,3  years,7/10/2007,Zoloft
737, 4, depression,My insurance switched me to generic sertraline when it came out_ and I'm usually a big fan of saving money_ but that pill was NOT THE SAME -- it dissolves way to easily (in my mouth_ before I even swallow it)_ burns my esophagus unless I take it with dairy_ and most importantly_ DO NOT BREAK IT IN 1/2 !  When my dose got lowered I tried taking 1/2 of a 100 mg pill_ but it is impossible to swallow_ dissolves even faster (in the mouth before you can swallow it)_ tastes nasty_ and burns like you're swallowing lye.,I previously took the brand-name product from Pfizer_ and it worked great - even helped my constipation_ and my libido has been better than ever (since I'm no longer depressed).,F,35,2  years,7/9/2007,Zoloft
738, 2, depression_ nervous breakdown,loose teeth (!) and zero sex drive,"I took for almost a year - and it did help ""even me out"" when it came to my mental state. HOWEVER- all of my teeth became loose and would ""pop and crackle"" when I bit down_ kind of like cracking one's knuckles. Dr. said that was not a side effect but I finally did find an obscure mention on a web site that this was a very rare side effect. Was VERY annoying and my teeth actually became loose enough to wiggle some of them with a finger. Weened off as soon as i could because this became rather distressing!",M,47,1  years,7/9/2007Email,Zoloft
739, 3, Depression and anxiety,Sweatiness_ loss of libido_ difficulty in orgasm_ EXTREME headaches if forget to take drug.,Zoloft certainly got rid of my depression and anxiety. It also helped me with sleeping and I did not gain any weight like others have. However I was younger when I tried this so perhaps my metabolism worked differently then.  It was impossible to reach orgasm on this drug so I would sometimes delay taking my drug to give my body a mini wash out period and this helped. However_ if I waited too long to take the tablet_ I endured severe headaches and had to lie down. Fortunately_ this was reversible as soon as I took the drug again. I eventually tapered off this drug thanks to my doctor's plan which worked perfectly. The main reason I gave up Zoloft is because at the time there were reports saying that long term use of it was dangerous.,M,40,2  years,7/6/2007,Zoloft

I will NEVER take this med again under any circumstances!",M,35,7  months,6/29/2007,Zoloft
741, 5, depression,loss of sexual desire and anorgasmia; difficulty maintaining a quality diet; difficulty getting up in the morning,My experience is that there is a minimal dose required to be effective_ and that there is a maximum dose above which the effectiveness wears off.  At the proper dose_ the effect is darned near magic.  Whoever said that the generic is not as good as the real Zoloft is exactly right.  There is a profound difference_ and it's not made up by increasing the dose.  The drug acts very quickly_ and the loss of sexual desire is almost immediate.  I haven't gained weight yet_ but I can see how it would be possible.  I have a yearning for donuts and recommend an aggressive program.  Also_ the combination with alcohol is seductive...watch out.,M,57,3  months,6/28/2007,Zoloft

743, 3, Major Depressive Disorder_ anxiety,Slight dizziness and nausea that went away after the first week_ yawning all the time_ feeling spaced-out_ disconnected_ and sedated_ complete loss of sex drive_ loss of appetite for the first few weeks,Zoloft worked somewhat_ it helped my anxiety and stress a whole lot_ but as for the depression_ I think it lessened it but did not relieve it completely. The major problems for me were the complete loss of sex drive and the sedation. I was not even vaguely interested in sex_ nothing aroused me at all. And I always felt out of it_ very sleepy and not able to concentrate very well. But it did improve my mood and I wasn't so hard on myself. I'm now switching to Wellbutrin XL because of the sexual side effects and sleepiness_ hopefully if those are gone I'll be able to get back to normal. I was afraid of Zoloft because of all the weight gaining stories_ but I haven't gained a pound. (Initially I lost a couple lbs due to the loss of appetite_ but gained it back after a few months),F,25,6  months,6/27/2007,Zoloft
744, 5, post partum depression,Mild malaise_ apathy. Didn't really notice the side effects until after I had stopped taking Zoloft and was back to my normal self.,Took 50mg every morning. Benefets greatly outweighed the side effects. It did take about two weeks to see any progress_ but was well worth the wait. I went from not being able to function at all day to day (think: would not get out of bed) to being able to get through the day like normal.Was very easy to wean. Went from 50mg to 25mg for about a week_ then was able to take nothing with no adverse effects. If I ever experience PPD again_ I will go straight to the doctor and request this medication again.,F,23,8  months,6/25/2007,Zoloft

I am constantly tired and everytime I move my eyes from side to side there is a sort of jolt throughout my body. It's horrible. Also I get extremely angry at minor things and start to ruminate over said minor things. I don't know how long this is going to last but I will be very happy once it's over. I really believe that SSRI's are evil. The only good that came out of using this drug has been that my anxiety went away and on the second day of using it the pain I had in my joints went completely away. Even that is not worth the mental pain I'm going through now. I am really disgusted with this drug.",M,36,7  weeks,6/14/2007Email,Zoloft
748, 3, fatigue_ irritability,Sleepiness_ didn't help with irritability_ helped somewhat with energy.,I had taken Zoloft initially for chronic fatigue and irritability. For about 1 year it worked well with taking the edge off the irritability_ but didn't do a lot as far as giving me energy. So I switched to Effexor_ which helped with energy_ but didn't help with the irritability. So I went back on the Zoloft since it helped with mood_ but this time it made me very sleepy! I had a hard time focusing and wasn't being productive at all. My ob/gyn suggested Wellbutin_ which I tried for 1 week and by day 6 and 7_ I laid in bed all night_ my heart beating fast_ my mind racing_ feeling very anxious and panicky.

I literally felt like there was an impenetrable force around me that nothing could get through. Nothing made me anxious. Nothing made me laugh. Just flat_ dull responses to life in general. This was not a good feeling for me. I like having energy.  It made me lose weight which is not good for me since I'm naturally thin. I had no motivation on it to do anything. I'd even stopped going to the gym which was something I hadn't stopped doing in years. I asked my psychiatrist specifically for Wellbutrin because of its low sexual side effects and high energy level it's supposed to bring. I'm now on day three of Wellbutrin.,M,36,6  weeks,6/3/2007,Zoloft

This medication saved my life.  I was very depressed and felt as if I was always disoriented.  I wasn't able to sleep at night because I always felt like I was going crazy.  I realized I had a chemical inbalance and once zoloft began working for me I was able to get a full nights sleep without waking up feeling like I was spinning or experiencing some kind of psychosis.  I wanted to end my life and zoloft really has helped me kick the depression and suicidal thoughts.  I take the brand medication zoloft_ not the generic.  This medication works wonderful for me.

That went away after a few days. And I was on 50MG for 4 years until last month they up the dose to 100mg and I feel fine no side effects.,Zoloft has been a life saver for me. I was first put on it in the fall of 2003 because of a panic attack (shortness of breath feeling of drowning). Three years later we found out I did not have a panic attack it was because I had pulmonary hypertension and really needed oxygen. In either case I have always been a control freak and would get enraged very easy. Zoloft has helped me to not sweat the small stuff and keep my cool during a crises. Recently I have had a series of events where I was having melt downs over things I could not control_ the doctor up the dose to 100MG. Problem solved. So far so good.,M,45,4  years,5/11/2007,Zoloft

The Dr. dismissed his symptoms and the fact that he had just started taking Zoloft.  They treated him for Cardiac symptoms.  Six days later my friend hung himself from the rafters in the garage of their house.  ZOLOFT is a horrible medication and there are many documented cases of suicide.

I ended up seeing a gastroenterologist.  On the table  prepped for a colonscopy_ the specialist noted_""get off the Zoloft.""  Post colonoscopy_ and no Zoloft_ the diarrhea went away.

Some loss of libido_ but that may be more age-related.,Zoloft has made a big difference in my life.  I probably would be divorced_ or dead_ if I hadn't started treatment with Zoloft.  I sought help for depression when I began to have serious problems controlling my temper--I would explode with anger at the slightest provocation.  I also would have frequent suicidal thoughts (I didn't realize until later that this was unusual--I thought everyone thought about killing themselves several times a week).  There is a history of depression and suidice in my family tree_ so my psychiatrist told me I will probably have to be on some sort of meds for the rest of my life.I currently take 200mg of Zoloft every day.  I take it right before I go to bed_ which I think helps keep any side effects under control.  I do have dry mouth_  but that is more from allergy meds than Zoloft.  I also have decreased libido_ but I'm pretty sure that peri-menopause is to blame for that.

PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT WEIGHT GAIN_ READ ON -->,75mg. I was VERY concerned about gaining weight when I started Zoloft.  I have gained 7 lbs_ but I don't think it's the drug_ per se.  Zoloft just prevents me from being as obsessive about food as I used to be.  I often don't think twice before reaching for that second handful of chips anymore.  But with increased energy_ my workouts have improved. If you expend some extra concentration and will-power making sure your diet doesn't increase in calories_ I don't think you will experience weight gain on Zoloft.  A lot of the weight gain people have experienced has to do with either a preexisting condition or a lapse in concentration on those little extra handfulls of calories_ which can really add up.  I was slightly underweight before zoloft because of depression and compulsive anorexic tendancies.  It's true that my weight wouldn't have increased without the drug_ but it was not a result of the drug itself_ rather it was a result of the way the drug made me think.

My doctor and I just realized that my weight gain might be from the Zoloft.  With the approval and supervision of my doctor I am trying to get off of the medication.  I have gone down to 50 mg a day_ and had no withdrawls.  I have tried to quit cold turkey and have experienced what some call ""brain shivers"".  It usually happens with another antidepressant.

I've been on and off of zoloft for a lot of years_ and it has helped fairly well.  However_ it seemed to lose effectiveness after a few months.  Then i had to increase the dosage (up from 50 mg).  This always made me a little bit manicky.  Now that i just started back on it_ i'm experiencing the usual side effects when starting(tiredness_ nausea_ constipation_ flucuations in mood and appetite_ sweating).  These subsided for me after about a week previous times i've been on it.  It's a good first stab at trying an ssri in my opinion.  if you are starting zoloft_ start at low dosages and increase only if needed.  Less is more.  *Note*  I am not a medical professional and have no medical training.

After I began to feel my teeth were foreign objects and couldn't stop grinding them and pulling at them_ my psychiatrist had me stop taking it. Up to that point it had eased a severe depression by making me more alert_ and allowing me to focus on one or two things almost to the point of being obsessive about them. I also got up early (6 AM) and went to bed early. I wasn't suicidal_ but felt a bit disconnected to any emotions_ good or bad. So the antidepressant effect wasn't ideal_ but it was a relief_ at the time. Please Note: I was prescribed this drug by a psychiatrist who thought I was suffering more from Depression than Bipolar Disorder II. Turns out_ she was wrong. Inaccurate diagnosis might explain why the drug had an undesirable effect on me.,F,32,2  weeks,1/16/2007,Zoloft
831, 2, socil anxiety_ OCD_ depression,zero sex drive_ initial rapid weight loss_ emotionally detached,I took Zoloft for nearly three years on multiple dosages.  It seemed to curb the social anxiety at first.  It did nothing for the OCD or the low-grade depression.  After two years I became increasingly closer to becoming agoraphobic_ never wanting to leave the house or talk to people outside of family or work.  The initially benefits disappeared_ and I have recently switched to Wellbutrin.,F,30,3  years,1/13/2007Email,Zoloft
832, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Initially it caused dizziness but it went away in 2 weeks (I know 2 weeks seems like forever_ but its worth it.) I took it for 10 years  and gain about 10 pounds in that time_ including having 2 kids. I did have sexual side effects_ namely difficulty with organism and suppressed libido - HOWEVER_ I didn't even notice for 3 years because I was too depressed for too long in my life to even think about sex. Zoloft helped me at least want to live long enough to have sex. Lower doses had less negative effect on libido_ higher doses destroyed libido. No other side effects for me.,"Eventually it was the sexual side effects that led me to seek a new medication for my MDD...which led to a new diagnosis...I'd been a misdiagnosed Bipolar all that time (another story). Then a DUMB DOCTOR ramped me up on 300 mg of Zoloft (which even the manufacturer does not including in proper dosing levels) and it spiked a horrid manic episode. I take Wellbutrin for depression now along with 2 meds for bipolar. HOWEVER_ I am VERY GRATEFUL to  Zoloft. It is a great ""first try"" medication in my opinion. I know people who just take low doses for PMS or just for 6 months for PPD. If I'd been taking Bipolar meds or other depression meds all those 10 years_ I may not have had such easy pregnancies_ healthy babies or be alive through many a depressed night of ""cutting"".",F,32,10  years,1/11/2007,Zoloft

I also really have a hard time getting up in the morning - I would prefer to sleep all morning_ which is a new thing.  Everything else has gone away or decreased in intensity.

It took exactly 2 weeks to kick in.I took one to two 1/2 pill of Xanax until the Zoloft kick in. Now I discontinued the Xanax all-together. The Xanax I needed to take it about 2-4 times in 24 hrs because it wears off after 4-6 hrs.   So I needed something that would cover the anxiety for 24 hrs a day.  Zoloft has done the job so far.

Sleeping and eating regularly seem much more important than before - I can sense my body a lot more than when I was depressed. Most side effects seem to occur before lunch or after dinner (I take it in the morning). In addition I am taking time-released xanax (short term) + B complex (AM)_ and 5HTP + fish oil (PM)_ plus psychotherapy_ healing touch (amazing) and a regular exercise program. Lately I am once again seeing a bright future. Spent two years anxious & depressed after my mom died.

Severe dry mouth (nothing but foam)_ diarhea_ zero appetite_ some insomnia_ very sedating (no energy_ can sleep all day)_ teeth clenching (what the hell is this nonsense?).  On day one I felt like all the muscles in my face were tightly contracted_ and I felt this inner pressure (no pain) as if my head was going to pop.  Thankfully that went away by day two_ or else there wouldn't have been a day three.,I will later do another review once I've been on it for a clinically significant amount of time.  I just want to provide info on early stages of side effects and benefits.  I have not yet noticed any improvement socially.  However I have been almost suicidally depressed for the past month due to an acute event.  The depression had left me bed ridden practically all day long.  I had a constant pit in my stomach and could not get my mind off of what happened.  As of day one on zoloft (25 mg)_ the pit in my stomach diminished greatly and the thoughts of my depressive event were lessened.  By day four the pit in my stomach is gone and I feel as if I can finally let go of what happened and move on.  The side effects suck_ and I cannot possibly remain a functioning member of society if they do not abate.,M,32,4  days,12/1/2006,Zoloft

I guess I am sensitive to medications.,The zoloft was a good medication for anxiety if you can tolerate the side effects. It was similar to paxil in the sense that it was more sedating.

I think these few minor side-effects are worth it_ because I feel so much better_ emotionally and physically.,I feel very satisfied with Zoloft. I've been taking 50mg for nearly a month now_ and I feel much better. My panic attacks have subsided_ and all their associated physical symptoms (tight chest_ pounding heart_ dizziness_ terrible weakness) are a thing of the past now. I honestly thought I was going to die of a heart attack or stroke four weeks ago_ and didn't believe that anxiety could cause such serious physical symptoms. I've also stopped worrying about every little thing_ and feel much more relaxed. Both my partner and daughter think I'm much more like my old self now - and I feel it_ too. In fact_ I've decided to finish my PhD next year - for the last 2 years_ I felt too low and depressed to even think about it...so I'm really enjoying all the benefits of Zoloft.,F,45,4  weeks,11/29/2006,Zoloft

My anxiety remains but I take other meds for that. No pill is going to be a miracle and cure your problems_ but this is a great start. It let me start living my life again. I love it.

My situation is not like your situation. Any advice you get is based on their own brain chemistry and reaction. But here is my experience with it. In my experience_ it allowed me to deal with my depression constructively_ like a project. It gave me mental balance. At first I was absent-minded and I slept for 14 hours one night. I was a little light-headed and foggy. There were sexual side affects (disinterest). And acne. But after a week I started feeling great. Fantastic in fact. Every day was like the first day of summer after finishing the 5th grade. I started at 25mg and went to 50mg. My goal was to overcome depression and get off the drug. So I ate a good diet of brain-food_ like fish_ fruits and vegetables while on the drug. It helped cultivate good brain chemistry. And I actively reduced the stressors in my life. And I exercised.,M,35,8  months,9/29/2006,Zoloft

It took away the running tingling sensations running down my arms and neck.  Initially I felt a little worse (I already felt very wretched) but from past experience I knew that would clear if I could fight through it.

I learned to increase the medication very very slowly.  increased by 12.5 mg every 3 to 4  weeks. Took nearly 6 months to get from 25 mg to 100 mg daily_ and another 4 to 6 to get up to 150. I occasionally take 175 if I feel that I need it.,Zoloft works for me_ but also in combination with psychotherapy. I don't think the meds were enough for me.

I started taking AmbienCR to sleep but at 12.5mg it only helped for 4 hours. I asked doctor about supplementing Zoloft with Trazadone(antidepressant) and he agreed. Trazadone puts me to sleep in 20 minutes. There is synergism (works well together) with the two antidepressants. Currently 50mg Zoloft and 125mg Trazadone. Not sure what ratio will work yet but if I can't sleep_ I can't function so I will continue to find balance. I researched Zoloft and literature says 50mg is max dosage. Anything over and it does not help(but I see many take it at higher dosage and my psych. doctor typically prescribes at much higher dosages to patients. This worries me.

Ive varied my dosage_ from a high of 200 to a low_ now of 25.  i am trying to wean myself off_ i know it will take time_ becuz experiences from missing a dose =weird bad day.  So i've been going down in 25 mg increments each month. i'm leaving the country for research for a year and fear i may not be able to obtain a reliable supply_ so better get prepared.

I stuck with it_ and I am very glad I did. It has been 4.5 months and have had no adverse side effects from Zoloft. I am only on 25 mgs_ but I feel it is working for me.  I have way more energy_ actually crave social situations_ when before I preferred solitude_ I have a sex drive_ and more confidence. The difference was very subtle_ but remarkably and slowly life-changing. I am still me. I still feel_ my emotions are not numb (thank God)_ but I no longer internalize_ and foster negative feelings. In addition_ I am more able to cope with life's blows without sinking into the abyss.,As I've already noted_ Zoloft is working very well for me. 4.5 months ago when I was researching Zoloft on-line_ it seemed that the only people who wrote comments about Zoloft were those with horrible experiences_ or had some other negative thing to say about it. Needless to say I was discouraged_ very fearful and skeptical to try Zoloft for my first time. I felt I was relatively normal_ with just mild depression and anxiety_ I certainly did not want to make my situation WORSE! Well I am happy I stuck it out for the initial two weeks (you'll make it through too)_ because now I feel like myself_ only fine-tuned. I promised myself that IF Zoloft worked for me_ I would come back and write my experience here. Keep in mind...it is alot easier for anxious/depressed people_ like most of us on this sight are/were to some degree_ to report negative feedback.

But with that said i lost my feeling of being lost and bored_ extreme anger/aggression_ feeling like i wanted to run away from my family_ and it even helps with my social phobia somewhat although that's still a big issue but at least i CAN go out sometimes without feeling like i'm going to die from people's rudeness sometimes.  It also got rid of the nightmares and suicidal feeling after suffering a dramatic event. I don't know what i would do without it!

After a few weeks on Zoloft it was amazing to me the way I felt (i.e._ not constantly depressed).  I think it did make me sleepy because I was constantly napping_ but that may also partly have been carried over from when I was depressed and unmedicated (I slept to avoid how I was feeling). After a year or so I realized I didn't have much of a libido anymore and after about 2.5 years on Zoloft I finally changed my medication_ but if it wasn't for that side effect_ I most likely would have stayed on it.,F,20,2.5  years,7/3/2006,Zoloft

I am less irritable_ etc. when I am on it. The only problem is_ it has absolutely killed my creativity. I am usually an extremely creative person. I am a professional artist. For some reason_ in the last couple of months_ my creativity just halted completely. I can absoulutely NOT think creatively at all_ which disturbs me. This has never happened before when I have been on it. It is very noticeable. Besides that_ though_ I would recommend it. I disliked Paxil and Prozac.

I have had no panic attacks and only a little break through anxiety and that is usually when I have not had enough sleep.  My depression seems to be getting better also.  My sexual ""feelings"" have actually been much better.  I also take .5 mg of xanax twice a day_ and I am going to start weaning off of it.

The first dosage was 50 mg and after that increased to 100mg.  The depression lifted a bit but the anxiety_ head pressure_ dizziness_ insomnia were unbearable.  Then the doctor increased it to 150 mg which made the head pressure worse so I slowly got back down to 100mg.  I am still feeling head pressure which is causing my moodiness but the doctor doesn't believe me.  If this head pressure will go away_ I think I would be able to cope much better. I'm afraid to switch to another anti-depressent because the withdrawals that I've experienced from Paxil & Effexor was a nightmare and I know Zoloft has similar withdrawals.

I take 150 mg a day and it took me a few months to get up to that amt.,F,36,1  years,4/20/2006,Zoloft

978, 5, panic attacks/phobias/depression,Exhaustion and mood swings (all within the first month or so_ but all subsided),Zoloft really has helped me.  DO NOT EVER EVER STOP TAKING THIS MEDICINE COLD TURKEY!!!!!!  Doing this will be painful and pointless.  After the initial side effects wear off_ zoloft helps to somewhat balance your emotions.  I was able to think begin thinking rationally after taking it.  I highly recommed this medicine_ but as with all other psychiatric prescriptions_ make sure that a GOOD psychiatrist is carefully monitoring you and your condition.  Sometimes the dosage needs to be adjusted_ which isn't too difficult.  Overall_ I will most likely be on this medicine and others for the rest of my life...and Zoloft is the one I trust the most.,F,19,5  years,4/17/2006,Zoloft

981, 4, Panic Attacks,Apathy and indifference_ lethargic_ sleepy_ slight memory loss_ twitching under left eye.,"I went on Zoloft for six weeks for severe ""panic attacks_"" so they call them.  What a deceiving label.  Basically the symptoms were: feeling ""surreal"" and scared_ adrenaline releases felt in my chest several times during the day_ fear of a brain tumor and so on.  This was when I decided to get on Zoloft_ mainly because I had fear I was ""terminally ill.""  The symptoms came on suddenly one day during a court trial (I am an attorney)_ and did not subside for weeks_ so I got on Zoloft as a last resort.  IT WORKED 100% - but...be on top of the dose at all times.  I was supposed to take 50 mg daily_ but the dose was way too high for me and made me feel horrible.  I remained on 25 mg and kept a daily journal.  Reading it now_ I see that after a week the attacks started to subside several hours per day_ and by week 3 they were entirely gone.

Sexual dysfunction also but was able to counter act that with Wellbutrin.  Sometimes dry mouth.,In a twist of fate I have been able to go from being tied all the time no matter how little of a dossage I took to being able to take the proper amount prescribed for my conditon (anywhere between 75 mg. and 125 mg. per day depending on my level of anxiety but am trying to regulate it so that I take the same amount each day) and now not experienceing any sleepiness at all_ if anything_ when taking higher dossages_ can sometimes have a bit of insomnia.

986, 5, depression and panic attacks,"A LOT.. But only for the first 6 weeks.  See_ the higher the dose that you need_ the longer the side effects last because you have to build yourself up to each dose by doing 10-14 days per 25mg dose until you build up to what you need.  Me_ I needed 100mg per day so it took me almost 7 weeks to build up to.  And_ the other precautionary measures I should mention are 1) The first 1-2 weeks you start you are going to be worse off mentally than you were before and you should stay with a trusted person (family member_ friend) for those couple weeks of adjustment because you will feel more anxious and potentially suicidal to begin with.  2) You CANNOT go off this medication cold turkey.  Just as you built yourself up_ you also have to take yourself down over a matter of weeks.  This is clearly written on the label but I_ at first_ didn't believe it until I tried going off of it all at once.

I am also able to focus much better_ to achieve my goals_ and to stop being paranoid and socia-phobic.  Overall_ it has made me the person I always knew I was but that my fears held me back from being.   Some people believe that these medications ""change you"" or make you somebody completely different.  That is the EXACT OPPOSITE of their effect.  They bring out the natural_ viable you and help you to logically eliminate your irrational and emotional hang-ups.

All these years I had just assumed that by nature I was anti-social and extremely shy_ only to find out that millions of people suffer from SAD. I'm one of those believers who thinks that everyone should take Zoloft. It's not only controlling my anxiety and depression but it's controlling anger_ and my thought process in general.

They will be subtle to you and come on gradually_ but in my observations of several people who take SSRI's in general_ they tend to make people less compassionate and slighty more agressive. I am worried about the long term effects of this medication because of their relative newess in the market. Nowhere can you find a study on people who have taken this stuff for 15+ years. I personally have been thinking of weaning off now because I have learned how to control the attacks_ or so I think I have anyways.

I finally see that there's potential in the good things in life as well.  The only thing I'd complain about is that sometimes I'd have a feeling of numbness_ not knowing what or how to feel.

Overall it improved my emotional mood_ reduced the anxiety symptoms and anticipatory anxiety. I started with 25 mg then increased to 50 mg. Sometimes taper off to 25 mg to reduce the laziness_ tiredness. I would not have taken it if I had not despise the excess social anxiety due to hectic life I am going through. If your anxiety(social or general) is a major problem_ I would strongly recommend this to you. But as previous posts mentioned it comes with the side effects. My work requires creativity and concentration_ thus the laziness or tiredness had the most adverse effect on my productivity.

Very difficult sensation to explain. Thank goodness I didn't have a funeral to attend people would have thought I was a cold person!!

1024, 4, Depression,First three days headache on just right side of the top of my head like someone was stabbing me but it wasn't severe pain I only took some tylenol twice for it. Had diarrhea when I first started taking it but drinking powder fiber mixed in water or juice gets rid of the diarrhea. So I drink powder fiber twice a day and my digestive system is totally normal. After 1 week getting a little more tiredness from it and yawning but not too bad. Right arm bicep twitching after doing pushups. Never had that happen before. Just happened once so far. Left heal tingling pins and needles sensation. I have a damaged nerve on that side and it seems to be effecting it but I only got that feeling twice for just a few minutes.,So far I am happy with the results of the Zoloft 50mg. I am also taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg with it which is supposed to counteract the sexual side effects and it does take me a little longer to orgasm but not much longer. It's also more intense when I do so all in all that part is fine. I cannot cry anymore which is good and bad. I used to cry for about an hour at least twice a week for no good reason and since I started taking this I haven't cried even once. The only time I actually shed a tear while taking this medication was laughing so hard tears were coming down and I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. I don't feel all drugged really just things are funnier to me and I laugh more. The bad part of not being able to cry is when I watch something sad on TV or a movie I can't even muster up a tear. I don't get entertained as much by a sad scene or I am not as moved by it. I can do without that emotion for a while though. It's overrated....lol.

1025, 3, anxiety_ possible mild depression,Today was my 3rd dose of Zolft (50mg). First 2 days had loose stools. This morning my jaw felt tight and then I suddenly was hit with an overwhelming feeling of panic. My heart was racing_ skin tingling_ and even oddly numb. Basically felt very very strange. As I'm a nurse I was convinced I was having an allergic reaction and was terrified I was going to pass out. Pulled myself together and spoke to GP & psych who feel it's anxiety and side-effects but even with my worst anxiety I have never felt quite like that. Am determined to persevere but fearful of experiencing the same thing tomorrow.,Am reassured by reading other people's comments but would like to know if anyhone else felt anything similar in first few days.Have trouble rating Zoloft as I have not been on it long enough to really know yet.,F,29,3  days,2/2/2006,Zoloft

Problems included feeling ""drugged_"" dizziness_ inability to concentrate_ and a general feeling of being disconnected and trapped from the rest of the world. It was a herculean effort on my part just to be able to show up for work during this time frame.",Currently_ the only side effect that I'm aware of is a diminished - almost non-existent - sex drive. I'm better able to handle my emotions and think before I react.

I scheduled an appointment to see him in 10 days due to my work schedule and just hope this ear ringing is not permanent damage.

The only thing is I'm a little obsessive compulsive and that part of my personality has not been damped very muchin the long run_ after a year of meds.,I like these med lots. I battled for a long time if I should seek meds as a solution to my depression_ and after one year and one dose increase to 100mg I feel like a person who is on top of my game. The long dark wet winters don't bother me. I always have the energy and positive attitude to do what I want -- not the negative depressed attitude I used to have. I used to get very nervous about being around other people and interacting with others. Now I actually enjoy being the center of attention and even seek out new friends. I cant say that Ive had any negative side effects from taking this medication. Sometimes counseling just isnt enough to battle having little confidence in your self and a depressed attitude about life. Zoloft just allowed my true inner being (the person I am when I am by myself) to be displayed on the outsidefor others to enjoy me as a person; so they can be positively influenced by me. ,M,32,1  days,12/31/2005,Zoloft

When missed 2 days of dosage_ bad headache. Stopped taking: headaches_ irritability that tapered off in a month.,"Definitely helped with depression & greatly reduced panic attacks. Did not feel ""high"" just normal_ and helped me function normally. Side effects minor. As I am not married and choose to live a celibate life_ sexual side effects were not bothersome. I took Zoloft for 12 years_ and I felt that in the past year it was not really effective anymore_ so decided to try life with out it. I am ok_ but now I know it helped me more than I realized. I also realized that I had spent the last 12 years sleepy!! And occasionally dizzy. In the 7 months since I have stopped Zoloft_ I am slowly falling back into depression & anxiety. I have tried Wellbutrin for 2 months-- no effect. Unfortunately_ many of us have faulty brain chemistry that needs a boost_ just like diabetics need insulin. There is no shame or weakness about this-- just the way our bodies are built. We are complex organisms_ though_ so what works for one doesn't work for another.

I felt less extreme. It curbed my intensity that I'd had my whole life_ making things just a little less crisis-like. I still had a lot of extreme emotions but they were slightly less intense. BAD SIDE: I had TERRIBLE withdrawal_ even over a long period of time of decreased dosage (took me almost a year to get off completely). Had electric shock-type reactions--tingling in my extremeties_ headaches_ etc. Had that feeling whenever I turned my head quickly like my brain was following afterward. Very strange and scary.

1084, 4, Depression and Anxiety,A temporary side affect that went away after a day or so was a feeling of being drugged and out of it. I started on 12.5 mg and went up to 25 with no problem. When I went to 50_ I felt tense and couldn't sit still_ had trouble drawing a deep breath. I went back to 25 and felt great for years_ although I developed a habit of taking naps all the time because it just felt so good to sleep. Over time_ I realized that the weight I steadily packed on was zoloft-related. I went off and lost weight fairly easily. I went back on Zoloft and the weight gain returned with a vengeance. I think it is making me crave carbs and sleep more. It depresses my sex drive_ but I can still orgasm.,It's not perfect_ because I've gained a lot of weight and don't have a lot of energy even at a low dose_ but it has been very_ very_ very successful at treating my depression and anxiety.

Even though I gained weight and had no sex drive I didn't much care about it.  I was sleeping at least 9 hours a day and still felt tired upon waking_ yawned throughout much of the day.However_ over time I felt it was becoming less and less effective.

1144, 5, Depression - Anxiety,Dry mouth,I stongly recommend this medicine if you experience anxiety or depression. Its help me change my life for the better. I was so scared to take any kind of pill to treat it_ thought it would go away. Its been almost a month and Im feeling so much better_ the shaking_ not being able to breath has almost went away. Its made more calm in stressful situation and I have a high stress job as well plus I have personal issues that I have to deal with that has made me depressed for so many years. Im so much happier and content with myself. I hope if you need help you realized before its to late_ I thought I could never be happy again.,F,33,1  months,5/7/2005Email,Zoloft
1145, 5, OCD_ Anxiety Disorder,Sex drive greatly diminished_ emotional apathy_ decreased appetite_ hot flashes_ fist-clenching.,Zoloft helped my anxiety disorders a LOT_ and I can now do things I couldn't do before. However_ the side effects can get a little out of hand. My libido left immediately_ but it seems like it's slowly back on the rise. Also_ even though the drug seems to make my happy times happier_ I can't quite connect emotionally to those around me in the same way. I've been told my characer is different. What's scary is that you don't realize it. Zoloft has made me hurt my most beloved without me even knowing.,M,20,3  weeks,5/5/2005,Zoloft

Maybe the other symptons will subside over time - we'll see.  On 50mg a day - not severe depression_ but felt myself sliding into it.

1220, 4, Depression and Anxiety,For the first three months_ the side effects were a little scary. Nausea_ lack of appetite_ jittery and tired_ dry mouth_ and interrupted sleep every night. You can't help but wonder what is going on with your body. I was reading numerous websites to see if what was occuring was normal. From my experience and talking with my doctor_ I think I am very sensitive to this drug and experience side effects more than most.  The good news is that with every week the side effects go away more and more. For me_ it took two months to feel normal.,Zoloft has been a blessing for me.  Approximately three weeks after starting it_ I began to feel a calm and peaceful feeling and was much more relaxed about problems that were really causing me a lot of stress. The drug doesn't create happiness_ but it eases the stress and tension enough so that you can see past them and enjoy the good things in your life.,M,31,3  months,1/30/2005,Zoloft

I had such a problem reaching orgasm dr switched me to desipramine. That helped_ but didn't work on the mood as well as Zoloft_ so I switched back because I felt it was worth it. Been back on it for a few months now and while my mood has improved I still have the sexual side affects. Dr added wellbrutrin to counter-act the sexual side affects. I hate taking all of this medication_ but I don't want to go back to my negative attitude. The muscle atrophy/weight gain is very concerning. Still do well in school and work.

All these things made me feel depressed and self-destructive at times. So I tried Zoloft... but it's not a miracle drug as people think it is. I think it is highly dependent on each person.

I still have trouble waking up in the morning which I thought was depression but maybe I just have a sleep disorder. I am going to switch back to celexa if possible since I took that before and the side effects were minimal and also to try and avoid zoloft withdrawl . from there on I don't know what I will do b/c celexa seemed to stop working after a year which was why I switched to zoloft. my doctor wanted to just increase my dose of celexa but this made me very dizzy_ almost blind when I would stand up fast or get out of bed. looking back this seems not half as bad as the side effects from zoloft.,F,29,5.5  months,11/29/2004,Zoloft

I still get uncomfortable sometimes like when I'm at the post office and I have alot of stuff to send out and there is a long line behind me.  I start getting antsy sometimes.  But I can control the sweating alot better now.   The dry mouth causes the corners of my lips to get chapped and dry.  The dry mouth causes teeth decay definitely and I have switched to a heavy flouride to help that.  I've noticed that my limbs have become more red:  palms_ feet_ ears and are more prone to sweats.  My vision isn't as great it seems.  I feel light headed alot and in elevators I get dizzy.  I have a feeling sometimes I am in my own little world (spacing out) at times.  Definitely tired more often and my muscles feel weeker.  I have alot less desire to exercise and to have sex.  When I do exercise_ I find that I have more congestion which causes me not to be breath as easy.  The hives/red spots on the forehead is when i do heavy physical activity like running/playing basketball.  After the activiity has stopped they go away in less than an hour.  Sexually_ Zoloft has decreased the experience for me.  I feel like I no longer need that at times.  I'm 27 years old so that isn't a good thing.

The only good thing it has done_ is made my moods SLIGHTLY constant - for that aspect_ i'd give it a 3 out of 5_ but as you can see from my side effects and the fact that it doesn't help my depression - the side effects outweigh the benefits.

1284, 2, depression/anxiety,At first it was great. I had some minor gastrointestinal issues. But lately I have feel like it is not working any longer. I am tired_ have headaches_ and don't really want to take it anymore.,I worry about the side effects. I am concerned about side effects that I will have when I stop taking it. I know I have to consult my physician.,F,44,10  times,10/28/2004,Zoloft
1285, 4, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,100mg/day dosage_ so far (but might go up).  Side-effects have included:* Some loss of sexual desire (a plus as my 'goofy comedic' personality scares people away and I hate having the desire.)* Some weight loss* Dry mouth/slight dehydration* Fatigue (this one is a definite problem.  When I was on Wellbutrin a few years ago_ I developed a spasm that got worse with fatigue or anxiety.  While I've been off Wellbutrin for 4 years_ the spasm malady has returned.  Excessive episodes of anxiety or the fatigue ensure I live with the problem_ and it's getting to the point of collapse when it happens.)* Constant_ albeit slight_ dizziness.  (I can no longer ride in some elevators as the deceleration causes me to keel over.),Prescribed to me for anxiety by one of the few competent doctors on this planet who knows how to diagnose patients.  It HAS helped.  People have said I seem less anxious (though my ADHD remains unaffected.),M,32,2  months,10/26/2004Email,Zoloft

1287, 1, very mildly depressed - situational,At first_ this medication helped my depression_ but after building up and in my system and becoming toxic_ I became severely short of breath_ pounding heart_ became severely agitated and depressed.  Admitted to hospital for what drs. thought was heart attack or pulmonary embolism.  Skin crawling_ could not stand to look at anything or listen to anything_ could not stand for anything or anyone to touch me.  Threatened to kill myself and others_ could NOT sleep_ and when I finally did go to sleep_ I had terrifying nightmares that were extremely vivid and horrifying.  Food repulsed me.  Any time I did eat_ would become sick and vomit.  Lost about 30 pounds.  Stopped taking Zoloft_ but still have off and on shortness of breath and some other symptoms. I am somewhat better now_ but I don't think I will ever be the same as before i took this medication.  I was never really depressed enough to be on it in the first place.  Now off this drug for 2 months_ I go from being severely depressed for a few days_ happpy and laughing for a few days_ back to being depressed.  Never was like this before I took this medication. If I had not stopped taking this drug_ I would have committed suicide without a doubt.,This medication should be taken off the market.  People taking this medication are completely unaware of how dangerous it is.  People need to be aware of the side effects that are not listed on the drug information.  This drug should be illegal and the people who make it should be punished.,F,45,10  months,10/25/2004Email,Zoloft

1292, 4, Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia,At first_ vivid dreams_ night sweats_ loss of interest in sex. These symptoms went away_ for the most part_ after the first few months. I also gained about 15 pounds that I have since managed to lose. Not sure if the gain was actually caused by the Zoloft -I'm relatively sure I could have prevented it if I had been more careful with my diet.,I haven't had a fullblown panic attack in many months. Still have a bit of agoraphobia_ but after 4 months of Zoloft I was able to travel for the first time in 6 years. Added benefits are that the migraines I had every month are all but gone_ my general mood is more stable than it's ever been in my life and the OCD symptoms I occasionally experienced haven't returned since I started taking it. I was resistant to taking medication for a long time - very glad I finally got desperate and gave it a shot.,F,32,2  years,10/15/2004,Zoloft

Now I'm experiencing many side effects and am questioning whether I should stay on it or not.  Of these_ includes: diarrhea_ numbness & sometimes heat in my hands & feet_ memory lapses_ itchiness_ light sensitivity_ nasal congestion_ neck pain causing bad headaches_ need to take deep breaths/feel short of breath_ muscle spasms/tension in my hands and jaw (twitching_ tremors_ lock jaw_ tooth-grinding_ very jittery)_ increased sweating particularly at night_ muscle cramps in my legs and arms_ increased irritability just prior to menstruation (moreso than ever before)_ occassional dry mouth_ and the sleeping flip flops (sometimes I sleep quite well and others I don't at all).,I think overall this is a good drug_ if the dosage is correct.  Hopefully_ if/when my doctor re-evaluates my dosage_ some or all of these side effects will subside.

A mild headache right between my eyes has developed. I know I have put on weight but am afraid to get on the scale to find out how much.,I am doing better except for the side effects. Dont like spending as much time in the bathroom as I am having to spend. My inability to have an orgasim bothers my wife more than it bothers me. I am going to give Zoloft a little more time. If the diarreah does not go away I will be quitting and trying something else.

1318, 2, Clinical depression/OCD/Anxiety,At first_ terrible diarrhea.  After a few days_ insomnia and headaches.  After a few weeks_ extreme apathy and lack of initiative/drive/motivation.  It did_ however_ fix the seratonin related imbalance_ such as excessive crying and worrying.,I would NOT recommend this med to anyone_ especially those who have an active social life.  This medication caused a horrible dopamine imbalance_ which current medicine can_ but WILL NOT TREAT.  I have been treating myself with dopamine agonists and dopamine precursors_ which are definetely working.  If you suspect depression_ it would be worth your while to do some research about neurotransmitters_ etc.  I have found that medical trends fail to recognize how dangerous these medications can be; the medical community is saturated by mass loads of marketing by pharmecutical companies_ which I think is sad because any seller WILL MOST LIKELY NOT state side effects_ in an effort to sell the drug.

However_ I feel that people should carefully evaluate their need for this medication since it is difficult to wean off and has potentially life-altering side effects (though most aren't dangerous_ per se).,F,29,4  years,9/21/2004,Zoloft

1322, 5, severe depression,I only had side effects in the beginning few days which were hand tremors and couldnt sleep until I started taking the pill in the morning instead of the evening which corrected that problem.,I think zoloft was a great antidepressant. I went from being a disfunctional depressed person to moderatly happy. I started out at 25 mgs and over the years increased from 100-150. For me the drug was great and helped with anxiety tremendously. It is only recently I am trying to change to Wellbutrin because of the weight gain. (40 lbs) It so far has been hard to change.,F,45,8  years,9/18/2004Email,Zoloft
1323, 5, General anxiety,I only take 25 mg daily. At first_ it made me extremely tired and slightly nauseous. Taking it at night helped. Also caused diarrhea and slightly diminished sex drive. After about four weeks_ nausea ended. And I discovered that the diarrhea seems to be due to an interaction with my birth control pill. If I take Zoloft at night and the birth control pill in the morning_ the stomach problems pretty much disappear.,This drug is amazing. I initially went on it to get me over a short term_ stressful period in  my life. Finances and moving were keeping me awake at night_ causing me to panic and be constantly stressed. It took about 4 weeks for the drug to really start working_ but Zoloft helped me put everything in perspective_ stop sweating the small stuff and be a happier person. It also_ unexpectedly_ made me no longer sensitive/easily annoyed by things like repetitive noises (squeaky wheels and windshield wipers_ for example.) I don't get moody during regular PMS times. And I'm much more relaxed and calm in confrontational situations at work or home. Although I'm over the stressfull period that caused me to go on the drug initially_ I've decided to stay on it because I'm such a happier person. I sleep great. I enjoy life. Life is peachy.

I have tried to get off this drug_ and the withdrawel is horrible - dizziness_ tingling sensation in head and arms_ nausia_ headaches.  Once you start taking this_ it is almost impossible to stop.  My sex drive is non-existent_ I could care less...  It is very hard to reach orgasm and I was a multiple before...  I do not recomend this to anyone.  In the year of use_ I have gained a very painful 50 pounds and fear that until I get off I will not lose it because the drug has been proven to make you crave carbs.  Try Anthony Robbins programs_ they are extremely effective and no physical side effects.  I am quitting cold turkey this time to see if I can just endure the withdrawel because the weening off process does not work.  This drug is a crutch and you will increase the dose at times of stess.

Also numbed my brain - had memory and concentration problems. Doctor took me off immediately and suggested Effexor but I will stop right here. I am still recovering from Zoloft after 4 days. I must say that the side effects did help with my IBS - I went to the bathroom 5 times the first day and had no bloat or pain.,Supposedly the most prescribed antidepressant_ and I know it works wonders for a lot of people_ so worth a try.

It was not an easy decision for me_ as the drug worked like a magic wand to eliminate all anxiety. I went from pacing the floor all day and shivering with anxiety_ not wanting to see anyone or do anything... to working with complete efficiency and walking around town with a bit of a smile --all the time. It was very_ very shocking and unexpected_ I had no idea the meds would have this effect & nothing I had ever taken had done this. I did not double-think anything- I just did it. It was quite wonderful_ except that I felt medicated... in a robot_ sci-fi way. That_ and the fact that overnight sex did not interest me at all_ was just too frightening. Medication should not eliminate your personality. But it was a still good experiment for me_ because it did show me what it feels like to live with zero anxiety.,F,38,2  weeks,3/1/2004Email,Zoloft

After about 2 years_ I began to notice my craving for alcohol was becoming a problem. I would literally drink 5ths of liqour every single day_ ruining my social life basically_ although I was happy inside_ sounds strange eh? I realized the Zoloft must be the source of the alcohol craving_ because thats when I started tapering myself off_ and the alcohol went away completely_ I went from 5ths a day to not a single drop just like that. Its strange because I had no side effects from the sudden decrease in alcohol. Tapering can be a bitch if you will_ the elecrtic eye shocks are very annoying_ and the lethargy can get to you. I am without Zoloft now and feel quite happy_ which I believe came with age. I do however still take benzo's whenever I can find them_ and Ultram everyday_ which feels like a better solution to me personally as the months before I stopped Zoloft I did notice that it seemed to stop working_ or it was becoming less effective_ I also couldnt ejaculate to save my life_ it took at least 1 hour even with the hottest women doing everything they could. Needless to say I lost alot of GF's that way heheh. If it wasnt for the sexual side effects_ I would say this drug is great.,M,25,4  years,2/23/2004,Zoloft

1518, 2, major depression_ anxiety,significant decrease in sex drive & satisfaction_ dry mouth_ minor sleeping difficulties_ slight feeling of indifference (numbness) - this last symptom_ however_ might have been the result of the depression and not the medication,didn't help very much_ although i took a low mg dose in relation to my size and only took it for about 2 months.  however_ i have spoken to two other people (one a family member) who take it and claim it helps them a great deal,M,25,2  months,5/26/2001,Zoloft
1519, 4, severe depression,At first I had super dry mouth and wanted to sleep forever.  That went away and then I had terrible problems reaching orgasm.  After 6 weeks or so my sex drive vanished completely.  My depression was gone until after about 5 months then the Zoloft just stopped working.  I found if I took a year off the Zoloft_ it would work again later so that's what I do.,I have tried almost all classes of anti depressants and so far this works the best.  I get all aspects of my life back together; career_ social_ family_ spiritual.  My love life suffers due to the lack of sex but it lets me focus on other areas.  I have been on and off Zoloft for 5 years and found that staying at a dose of 25mg each morning is the best.  Increasing the dose only increased the side effects. Zoloft let me still feel sad or angry at times_ it didn't make me a complacent_ happy person.  It helpped me to feel the appropriate feelings for a situation instead of the all consuming feelings of doom and self loathing.   Without antidepressants I am sure I would have kiled myself by now.  No matter what the side effects are it's worth it to get me back on my feet and let me feel good for a change.,F,38,5  years,5/24/2001,Zoloft
