3, 4, Depression and anxiety,Decreased appetite and anxiety the first week. Withdrawal symptoms including brain zaps_ slight headache_ decreased apetite_ dizziness_ nausea_ and anxiety.,Took it for a year and 4 months. Not sure if it was the drug itself or because my life situation changed but my depression and anxiety gradually became less. I could still feel down sometimes and have anxiety attacks but they would never be as frequent or as bad as before taking the medicine. Stopped taking it when I felt no need for it anymore (with an OK from my doctor). Stepped down to 25mg for two weeks before stopping completely. Withdrawal symptoms appeared 3 days after my last pill and lasted for a week. It's been 1_5 months since and I feel fine.,F,20,1  years50mg,7/14/2016,Zoloft

12, 3, Depression,Periods of time when I was starving literally all day despite having eaten a normal amount. Really bad insomnia for the first 6 months - has gotten better but now I sleep way too much and am always tired. Used to get pretty bad anxiety for the first 3 or so months but now that is very rare. The hunger has probably been the most unmanageable of the side effects for me.,Can't say it didn't work. I definitely started feeling less gloomy around 2 weeks after I started taking the med. I was initially on 25MG but got moved up to 50. About a year in I've found that the medication has an immediate effect on me right after I take it_ and the effect of each pill seems to last almost exactly 24 hours. Whenever I've forgotten to take a pill for a day or two I can clearly tell that I feel way more hopeless and depressed. About 2 hours after taking a pill I'll usually be just fine again. Kind of worried that I may be too dependent on it.,F,18,1  years50 MG,5/23/2016Email,Zoloft

15, 3, Postpartum depression,Extreme fatigue,My usual antidepressant is Prozac but I was given Zoloft for my postpartum depression because Prozac was not safe to take while breastfeeding. Zoloft definitely improved my mood but made me sleep constantly which was not conducive to my taking care of a newborn. I tried to stick it out hoping my body would adjust to the Zoloft but after about three months I realized I would not be able to continue to care for my baby with such a low level of energy_ no matter how much sleep I got I struggled to stay awake_ so I stopped taking it_ and almost immediately my energy came back. I had to switch my baby to formula but it was worth it to have enough energy to function. Zoloft did help my mood though so it wasn't all bad. The negatives outweighed the positives for me personally.,F,22,3  months50 mg,5/17/2016,Zoloft

Slight nausea sometimes if I take it on an empty stomach.,This drug is not for everyone_ but it works well for me. My symptoms are decreased and I am able to function much more normally. I was a wreck before I started seeing a therapist. She recommended that I try the Zoloft after meeting with me for a few months. It helped a lot. Shortly after this_ I was diagnosed with Crohns disease. So that was what may have triggered my symptoms. Anyway_ through it all the Zoloft helped me manage the stress. I recommend seeing a mental health professional (not just family DR) before starting Zoloft though. Now I get it from my PCM but Im glad I saw a therapist while I was starting with it.,F,39,7  years100 1X D,4/29/2016,Zoloft

When I went down to half a pill it didn't help at all. On my first day I spent literally all day in bed nauseated (I was surprised I didn't vomit).

And whenever I increased my dose (+25mg) I had a constant headache/stomach ache for at least a week,This medicine did nothing for me unfortunately. It works wonders on my mum_ so I gave it a shot but sadly it gave me more anxiety/depression like symptoms. I would wake up in a pile of sweat every single morning and woke up and went to bed with headaches. There were no positive side effects for me and getting off of it was really rough -  withdrawal symptoms were the same as the side effects plus brain zaps.

Once I found myself on the toilet wondering who I was_ where I was_ what day it was_ time of day_ etc. TERRIFYING!!! so I (obviously) stopped taking it. It was a BRUTAL 6 months of withdrawals. Months of torturous vertigo and what I can only describe as brain buzzing. It felt like when you are falling asleep and jerk awake. I had 5+ a minute for months.

36, 5, anxiety,cloudy headed for the first few days_ but went away entirely,I wanted to share my experience with Zoloft_ because it changed my life. During my undergraduate education I suffered with crippling anxiety attacks_ which almost led me to quit school. My doctor put me on Zoloft (this was back in 2003) 25mg_ and gradually raised the dose to 100mg over the course of a few months. It was almost like a light switch turned on in my brain. I just didn't get anxiety attacks anymore. I am so very thankful for this drug_ because without it I don't think I would've been able to continue my education (which ultimately led me to become a doctor). I have now finally weaned myself off of Zoloft (100mg_ down to 50mg for 1 year_ 25mg for 6 months_ then 25mg every other day for 2 months_ then off completely). If you are struggling with anxiety_ perhaps my story will help change your life too. There are so many negative reviews online_ so I thought I'd share a success story. For me Zoloft was a lifesaver.,M,37,12  years100mg 1X D,12/29/2015Email,Zoloft

Went up to 75mg for a week and it knocked me out. Doctor advised to go back down to 50mg_ and at about the month mark_ I noticed that my baseline anxiety level was now manageable.

45, 4, Depression,Myoclonus_ anal itching.,I took Zoloft way back in 1996-97 for about a year and a half_ first at 50 MG_ then 25 MG. It gave me a real boost_ I had more energy and was more positive and focused. The myoclonus can be annoying as they affect small muscles all over the body_ from the face to the feet. The anal itching was the worst. I actually get that with all SSRI's_ not just Zoloft. I guess it has to do with the increased bowel movements. The effects of Zoloft_ including the side effects_ lasted for many years after I stopped taking it. One positive side effect was also that it cured my premature ejaculation. Otherwise it didn't affect my libido. One potentialy negative side effect of all antidepressants is that you feel a little emotionally detached from your environment. It can help you through bad periods of your life but you may also miss or overlook signs that things around you aren't for the best. Always take these drugs under the supervision of a professional.,M,25,18  months50 MG 1X D,11/24/2015Email,Zoloft

I understand that FDA has not approved any medications yet for BDD_ but this was kind of an experiment to see what would work best with me. Zoloft did not work AT ALL for me. It made my symptoms worse_ in fact. I started binge eating again. It basically cancelled out any benefits that Wellbutrin gave me. I had 20-30 heart palpitations a day. I was an anxious wreck. It's strange because I've used Zoloft in the past for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I was a young child_ but my mother said it worked well for me. Oh_ well.

I finished one prescription and the second one I never finished it. After 3 weeks of taking it I saw myself losing my mind_ yes it was helping but it was making me someone I've never been. Being that I'm a writer and in touch with my soul_ I self diagnosed myself and as I felt a little better I would skip days and force myself to regain my own emotional strength and when there was days that I couldn't handle the depression that would be when I would take it to calm me down. Then I would force myself to gain strength to keep going without it. It did help in that sense_ but that was because I didn't want it to control me and my natural behaviors as it was in the first 3 weeks. I got kicked out of college because of mental trauma and I felt as if it wouldn't go away. Best advise I could give you is if u do take this it will not cure the depression ur in but it will help you cope with it if you take it only when you're feeling as if you can't handle it on your own_ it does help. Also be in control don't let the medication control you_ as far as libido it does come back so have faith if ur strong willed and in control of the medication it will come back.

In the initial two weeks on the medication I also experienced tingling and numbness in my fingers_ toes and lips_ as well as brain zaps.,It helped my depression in the sense that it stopped me from feeling anything. I kept persisting with it at the advice of my doctor_ being reassured that it was worth it in the long run. But I would not recommend it to anyone. This medication ruined my life. Four months after I stopped taking it my memory_ concentration and libido have not fully returned. I'm still struggling with my weight. I still feel numb_ yet my anxiety is as bad as ever.

The side effects got stronger and stronger as I felt brain fog_ chronic fatigue and all those other side effects I mentioned on a daily basis. I would also wake up in the mornings drained out feeling dizzy_ making it real hard for me to get ready and go to work. I also gained like 7lb while on zoloft.
