0, 1, Chronic sinusitis,Extreme suicidal thoughts. After reading this for 3 days I had severe suicidal fantasies and stopped taking it. I refuse to ever take it again.,I took this for 3 days_ suicidal ideation began on day 2 of taking it_ and took about 2 days after I stopped taking it for the side effects to go away.,F,23,3  days,8/16/2016,Medrol

2, 1, Herniated discs,My face broke out really red and was burning for 2 weeks...my hormones became out of balance and I had hot flashes really bad with increased sweating......it made my period late 2 weeks....it has been 8 weeks since I stopped taking medrol and I have been having continuous side effects that I have never had before.....missed periods_ severe anxiety_ blood sugar fluctuations_ depression_ sweating and a severely bloated stomach....,,F,,1  days,6/29/2016Email,Medrol

4, 5, Severe scoliosis,A little sleeplessness and overall depressed feeling.,I take a medrol dosepak when the pain from my scoliosis is too much to handle. I wish it wasn't so bad for you_ because it works better than any narcotic pain meds_ which I have to take daily. Without medrol I would spend at least a few weeks every year in bed_ missing out on life. After the six day pack I feel like a teenager. No pain anywhere. ,F,40,6  days4mg taper,6/20/2016Email,Medrol

7, 3, Viral Rash,Nearly Instant: DEPRESSION/MOOD SWINGSDay 2: Indigestion_ stomach crampsDay 3-7: Frequent BM - NOT diarrhea. Fatigue. Change in taste perception (things tasted salty). General malaise. Down moodDay 7-14+ : GI upset lingering,I wasn't ready for the depression and mood swings. I took two in the late morning since I started work late that day. By the time I got at work_ I was a brooding_ depressed mess. I ended up getting sent home bc my supervisor noticed that something wasn't right with me. I was hostile_ absolutely exhausted_ didn't want to be consoled_ touched_ talked to_ anything. By day 3 the depression was in a manageable state but the gastrointestinal side effects were in full force. I was being woken up in the the middle of the night for very small bowel movements (solid_ not diarrhea) _ and the second I left the bathroom and got back to my bed I had the urge to do it again. This continued throughout the day and was very hard to manage at work but I noticed some days were worse than others. I would say at its peak I had about 10 bowel movements a day while on medrol. Pepto and tums do nothing_ the only symptomatic relief I found from this is Gaviscon antacid (containing aluminum/magnesium). These symptoms lasted 5 days AFTER I was done with my dosepack.Be VERY careful taking this_ especially the first couple doses_ if you have never taken it before and have a history of mental illness/depression. Seriously. I have had bouts with depression in my past but I was totally caught offguard by how quickly and intense those feelings came back after taking my first dose. In hindsight_ was NOT worth the side effects for the small benefit it had on my rash.,M,23,7  days4MG 1X D,5/29/2016,Medrol

I didnt like the feeling at all especially didn't care for being prescribed something so hardcore without the ENT having a diagnosis other than saying""it mightwork if you have inflammation somewhere.I was never given a steroid card_ or any information on anything about it. Only the how to list from the pharmacy.. Not happy at all. I have chest pain_ extremely weak and lack of sleep just from abruptly stopping cold turkey 16 mg from one day.. Geez. Anyone feel free to email me with advice to give_ or if i can help or pray with anyone suffering. God bless_ in Jesus name!",M,35,1  days6 day pack,4/7/2016Email,Medrol
11, 3, Viral ear infection,Insomnia_ dehydration/dry mouth_ muscle pain/stiffness.,I'm on day two of a taper pack after going 4 days with clogged ears. Each pill is 4mg_ tapered from 24mg to 4mg per day over 6 days. My PCP determined I had a viral infection and prescribed the Medrol pack for the inflammation. My ears are clear after 1 day! But_ I now have dry mouth_ insomnia_ and muscle pain/stiffness in my legs like I ran a marathon. I'm bad about hydration_ so the muscle stiffness may be due to dehydration. My PCP did stress staying very hydrated while on Medrol. I'm glad my ears are better_ but I stand a lot at work. Hopefully my legs start feeling better as I taper off.,F,28,2  days4mg,4/6/2016,Medrol

Swollen throat.tender at the top of my head.,This is so sad you trust these doctors with your health and they use you as a experiment. I feel worse then when i started.,F,32,5  days4mg,4/5/2016Email,Medrol
13, 4, bronchial asthma,Was prescribed Medrol because Advair 250 wasn't controlling my asthma while sick with bronchitis. I've taken Medrol before and while not a fan_ it greatly improves my asthma symptoms. It makes me incredibly fatigued_ jittery_ increases my pulse rate and sometimes upsets my stomach. I usually get flushing on my face and chest. I also find I'm thirsty while on this med. I felt anxious the first day but knew it was the drug so didn't go into full panic mode. No sleep disturbances whatsoever.,Picked up my script late in the day. The pharmacist said to take all first day doses that afternoon/evening. Smartly decide to start the following morning as I was also using my  rescue inhaler and Advair.  Dr. and pharmacist said it was ok to continue the Advair 250 while on Medrol. Don't remember doing this before and at the end of day two stopped the Advair  because it's an inhaled steroid and thought that maybe it was adding to the side effects of the Medrol. As I taper off the pills I'll restart the Advair 250 and eventually taper to my maintenance dose of Advair 100. Weighing all pros and cons the simple fact is I'd rather be able to breath normally without wheezing_ chest tightnes and the other issues asthma presents. Also would rather Medrol then a trip to the ER with a full blown asthma attack. Just to be clear_ I started out taking 6 pills on day one and tapered down to one pill on day 6.,F,45,6  days4mg dosepk 6X D,3/26/2016,Medrol
14, 5, I had a sinus infection.,Some sleeplessness,It works great.  My head was so congested I had to sleep sitting up_ after 24 hours on medrol_ I felt great!  This should be sold over the counter!,F,52,6  days,3/22/2016,Medrol
15, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis Flare,Anxiety_ stomach upset_ mood swings,I have taken this medicine several times. Sometimes the side effects are almost unbearable_ other times not too bad.  Regardless_ I am always thrilled to take it because by the time my rheumatologist prescribes steroids_ the pain and swelling are so bad I would be willing to try anything. And this medicine does work. In day two of taking it swelling had decreased so much that I could see an ankle I hadn't seen in WEEKS.  The point has been made before_ but by their nature web sites like this are not objective.  All the people who took the meds without side effects and it worked great are out enjoying their lives with no need to post on a site like this. I would add that it is a serious medicine and I wouldn't take it for a minor illness or injury.,F,44,5  days,3/11/2016,Medrol
16, 4, sinus and upper RI. and flare,,I have 2 separate spine diseases so fight inflammation on a daily basis. This medication has mad me so sick to the point of massive meadaches_ my scalp felt like someone poured acid on it and NO appetite at all. The longer I tried to take it_ the sicker I became to the point I felt like I was dying. Literally. I seem to do fine with the Toradol shot which is a NON steroidal shot but for SOME reason_ these steroids make me SO MUCH worse!! It DID help bring my pain DOWN from about a 7 to a 5_ BUT I can not handle the massive headaches_ scalp burning_ and over ALL feeling as if I am going to dye_ because of the reaction to this medication. ?.,F,44,6  days4mg,2/15/2016Email,Medrol

18, 1, Migraine,Joint pain that still persists months later. Ovarian cysts thatshe never had before this med.,My daughter took this last year. After a few hours_ joint pain that was severe. Never had a single issue with joint pain before. Read the side effects and see joint pain listed as severe_ call doc right away symptom. Call doc. Says to keep taking it. Takes a days worth and pain increasing. So we stopped taking it. Daughter has lingering joint pain that comes and goes but never goes away completely. Plus now suffers from ovarian cysts when she never had that problem before. Went to doc for headaches in an otherwise very healthy kid and now she suffers joint pain all the time. Ridiculous!!!! If anyone elsehad this experience and knows where I can go from here to get some answers about this ....please contact me.,F,16,1  daysDose pack,1/19/2016Email,Medrol
19, 2, Intercostal Neuralgia,Nausea_ diarrhea_ anxiety,Took the 6 day dose pack. On the 3rd day started feeling a little off in the stomach. 4th day had nausea anytime I ate something and almost puked. Woke up that night with bad stomach cramps needing to go to the bathroom. Nausea started to subside by 5th day when I had to take only 2 pills_ but now I'm on the morning after my last dose and woke up again with bad cramps and a need to hit the head. Stomach is very uneasy with lots of peristalsis and gurgling going on. I have IBS and a sensitive stomach so I don't feel this medication was a good choice for me. Didn't really work too well on my pain as it's for inflammation_ not nerve pain. Will not take again_ and hope side effects do not last much longer.,M,38,6  days4MG,1/17/2016Email,Medrol
20, 3, Intractable Migraine,Some nausea_ light-headedness_ sleepiness_ sort of drunk/stoned feeling_ anxious.,I have mix-feelings about this medication. I was on a 6 day tapered dose pack for an intractable migraine after exhausting all other options including 2 ER trips the previous week. It definitely helped_ but not as well as I hoped. I was pretty loopy the first few days_ overly-talkative and energetic while feeling a bit wasted at the same time. I had zero appetite change and slept just fine which was awesome considering these are common side-effects. I decided to withstand the other stranger side-effects_ since none were life threatening and I was getting some relief. I also took pepto- bismol the first few days which definitely helped with the stomach upset. Definitely take with food and if you are sensitive to medications I'd be wary of driving the first few days.,F,44,6  days 6X O,1/15/2016,Medrol

28, 5, sinusitus_ bronchitis_ Poison ivy,I have taken this no less than 20 times in my lifetime for sinusitus_ bronchitis or poison ivy - always after other treatments failed to work.  I've never experienced problems and have always begun to improve on days 2 or 3. I think this is a great drug.  Before you damn your doctor about side effects_ consider that all these posts are probably the result of people having them and going on the internet and the vast majority of patients experience no significant issues and remain blissfully unaware.  I'm not saying your symptoms aren't real - I'm on this page because my wife is taking it and her face is flushing on day 2 - but for many of us_ the Medrol dose pack is great!,,M,50,6  days4MG 1X D,11/8/2015,Medrol

I felt like I have no control over myself. I stooped taking the med right away and now It has been 3 weeks that I stopped this med and I still feel weak and I can not handle any stressful situation yet.

30, 5, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease_ MS,about a 2 year weight gain.,This med helps to keep me mobile. It also helps with all of the inflammation in my body.

Violent mood swings come out of nowhere. I'm glad I don't have to return to work for another month while I recover from back surgery. It's been a week and a half since I stopped taking it on the fifth day and I still have side effects at random. I hope it stops soon. This stuff is basically toxic and is equivalent to torture.

35, 1, tooth pain,Chest pain_ shortness of breath_ dizziness_ rapid heart rate_ headache_ insomnia_ facial redness_ headache,I was prescribed the 6 day pack for tooth pain. I spaced the intervals on the first day_ two with breakfast_ one with lunch_ two with dinner_ and one before bed. By 5:30 in the evening after the first three_ my heart was racing_ the shortness of breath and chest tightness had kicked in full force. I wasn't sure what to do_ so I started reading online and kept coming to the consensus to not to stop taking the medicine. So I took the evening doses_ that's when the dizziness started up_ and I was awake until nearly 3am. On the second day_ I woke up with my face and neck all red_ I called the endodontist_ my doctor_ and pharmacist_ all said to quit taking it. I wish I had read more about side effects before taking the first dose_ I was just so desperate to get out of pain.

Overall_ while I was very productive at work and the pain lessened considerably_ there were some gastrointestinal side effects as well as a feeling of being sped up.

I have been up all night all day. If now 6:00pm on a Wednesday I still feel bad and Im wide awake.I take Lunesta for sleep at night and I'm still awake.I also_went to the bathroom about 10 times. This has worn me out.,I'm afraid to take today's dose in fear of never being able to go to sleep!!!!! :-/.,F,60,1  days4 mg,5/6/2015,Medrol
59, 1, mild Bronchitis,Flushed_ then very strong reddening of the face_ neck_ ears-back & forth. Tingling sensation around the mouth. Strong anxiety & sleeplessness. Reddening of eyes_ mild pupil dilation. Redness of palms and soles of feet. Thirst and loss of appetite.,I have COPD_ and developed a mild case of Bronchitis. I was prescribed Cefdinir (20 pills_300mg) and Medrol 6 day 4mg (Methylpredsolone) tapering down pack. I am SOOO glad I didn't take all six at once_ as the pack recommended (if you get your RX late in the day)! Good god! The side effects are miserable. I am not very happy with my Doctor for not making it clear about these. Yes_ even madder at myself for not having read to RX sheet. I will never take this again. Tomorrow is day three for me and I think I'm done with this. Yuck.,M,52,6  days4 mg tabs 1X D,5/1/2015Email,Medrol
