0, 1, Chronic sinusitis,Extreme suicidal thoughts. After reading this for 3 days I had severe suicidal fantasies and stopped taking it. I refuse to ever take it again.,I took this for 3 days_ suicidal ideation began on day 2 of taking it_ and took about 2 days after I stopped taking it for the side effects to go away.,F,23,3  days,8/16/2016,Medrol

4, 5, Severe scoliosis,A little sleeplessness and overall depressed feeling.,I take a medrol dosepak when the pain from my scoliosis is too much to handle. I wish it wasn't so bad for you_ because it works better than any narcotic pain meds_ which I have to take daily. Without medrol I would spend at least a few weeks every year in bed_ missing out on life. After the six day pack I feel like a teenager. No pain anywhere. ,F,40,6  days4mg taper,6/20/2016Email,Medrol

7, 3, Viral Rash,Nearly Instant: DEPRESSION/MOOD SWINGSDay 2: Indigestion_ stomach crampsDay 3-7: Frequent BM - NOT diarrhea. Fatigue. Change in taste perception (things tasted salty). General malaise. Down moodDay 7-14+ : GI upset lingering,I wasn't ready for the depression and mood swings. I took two in the late morning since I started work late that day. By the time I got at work_ I was a brooding_ depressed mess. I ended up getting sent home bc my supervisor noticed that something wasn't right with me. I was hostile_ absolutely exhausted_ didn't want to be consoled_ touched_ talked to_ anything. By day 3 the depression was in a manageable state but the gastrointestinal side effects were in full force. I was being woken up in the the middle of the night for very small bowel movements (solid_ not diarrhea) _ and the second I left the bathroom and got back to my bed I had the urge to do it again. This continued throughout the day and was very hard to manage at work but I noticed some days were worse than others. I would say at its peak I had about 10 bowel movements a day while on medrol. Pepto and tums do nothing_ the only symptomatic relief I found from this is Gaviscon antacid (containing aluminum/magnesium). These symptoms lasted 5 days AFTER I was done with my dosepack.Be VERY careful taking this_ especially the first couple doses_ if you have never taken it before and have a history of mental illness/depression. Seriously. I have had bouts with depression in my past but I was totally caught offguard by how quickly and intense those feelings came back after taking my first dose. In hindsight_ was NOT worth the side effects for the small benefit it had on my rash.,M,23,7  days4MG 1X D,5/29/2016,Medrol

I didnt like the feeling at all especially didn't care for being prescribed something so hardcore without the ENT having a diagnosis other than saying""it mightwork if you have inflammation somewhere.I was never given a steroid card_ or any information on anything about it. Only the how to list from the pharmacy.. Not happy at all. I have chest pain_ extremely weak and lack of sleep just from abruptly stopping cold turkey 16 mg from one day.. Geez. Anyone feel free to email me with advice to give_ or if i can help or pray with anyone suffering. God bless_ in Jesus name!",M,35,1  days6 day pack,4/7/2016Email,Medrol
11, 3, Viral ear infection,Insomnia_ dehydration/dry mouth_ muscle pain/stiffness.,I'm on day two of a taper pack after going 4 days with clogged ears. Each pill is 4mg_ tapered from 24mg to 4mg per day over 6 days. My PCP determined I had a viral infection and prescribed the Medrol pack for the inflammation. My ears are clear after 1 day! But_ I now have dry mouth_ insomnia_ and muscle pain/stiffness in my legs like I ran a marathon. I'm bad about hydration_ so the muscle stiffness may be due to dehydration. My PCP did stress staying very hydrated while on Medrol. I'm glad my ears are better_ but I stand a lot at work. Hopefully my legs start feeling better as I taper off.,F,28,2  days4mg,4/6/2016,Medrol
12, 1, Viral infection,Shortness of breath. Gas bloating movement in my stomach. Heavy chest. Feeling like im bout to die. Mood swings.struggling to sleep. Weak tired.pressure in both ears and head. Swollen throat.tender at the top of my head.,This is so sad you trust these doctors with your health and they use you as a experiment. I feel worse then when i started.,F,32,5  days4mg,4/5/2016Email,Medrol
13, 4, bronchial asthma,Was prescribed Medrol because Advair 250 wasn't controlling my asthma while sick with bronchitis. I've taken Medrol before and while not a fan_ it greatly improves my asthma symptoms. It makes me incredibly fatigued_ jittery_ increases my pulse rate and sometimes upsets my stomach. I usually get flushing on my face and chest. I also find I'm thirsty while on this med. I felt anxious the first day but knew it was the drug so didn't go into full panic mode. No sleep disturbances whatsoever.,Picked up my script late in the day. The pharmacist said to take all first day doses that afternoon/evening. Smartly decide to start the following morning as I was also using my  rescue inhaler and Advair.  Dr. and pharmacist said it was ok to continue the Advair 250 while on Medrol. Don't remember doing this before and at the end of day two stopped the Advair  because it's an inhaled steroid and thought that maybe it was adding to the side effects of the Medrol. As I taper off the pills I'll restart the Advair 250 and eventually taper to my maintenance dose of Advair 100. Weighing all pros and cons the simple fact is I'd rather be able to breath normally without wheezing_ chest tightnes and the other issues asthma presents. Also would rather Medrol then a trip to the ER with a full blown asthma attack. Just to be clear_ I started out taking 6 pills on day one and tapered down to one pill on day 6.,F,45,6  days4mg dosepk 6X D,3/26/2016,Medrol
14, 5, I had a sinus infection.,Some sleeplessness,It works great.  My head was so congested I had to sleep sitting up_ after 24 hours on medrol_ I felt great!  This should be sold over the counter!,F,52,6  days,3/22/2016,Medrol
15, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis Flare,Anxiety_ stomach upset_ mood swings,I have taken this medicine several times. Sometimes the side effects are almost unbearable_ other times not too bad.  Regardless_ I am always thrilled to take it because by the time my rheumatologist prescribes steroids_ the pain and swelling are so bad I would be willing to try anything. And this medicine does work. In day two of taking it swelling had decreased so much that I could see an ankle I hadn't seen in WEEKS.  The point has been made before_ but by their nature web sites like this are not objective.  All the people who took the meds without side effects and it worked great are out enjoying their lives with no need to post on a site like this. I would add that it is a serious medicine and I wouldn't take it for a minor illness or injury.,F,44,5  days,3/11/2016,Medrol
16, 4, sinus and upper RI. and flare,,I have 2 separate spine diseases so fight inflammation on a daily basis. This medication has mad me so sick to the point of massive meadaches_ my scalp felt like someone poured acid on it and NO appetite at all. The longer I tried to take it_ the sicker I became to the point I felt like I was dying. Literally. I seem to do fine with the Toradol shot which is a NON steroidal shot but for SOME reason_ these steroids make me SO MUCH worse!! It DID help bring my pain DOWN from about a 7 to a 5_ BUT I can not handle the massive headaches_ scalp burning_ and over ALL feeling as if I am going to dye_ because of the reaction to this medication. ðŸ˜ž.,F,44,6  days4mg,2/15/2016Email,Medrol

18, 1, Migraine,Joint pain that still persists months later. Ovarian cysts thatshe never had before this med.,My daughter took this last year. After a few hours_ joint pain that was severe. Never had a single issue with joint pain before. Read the side effects and see joint pain listed as severe_ call doc right away symptom. Call doc. Says to keep taking it. Takes a days worth and pain increasing. So we stopped taking it. Daughter has lingering joint pain that comes and goes but never goes away completely. Plus now suffers from ovarian cysts when she never had that problem before. Went to doc for headaches in an otherwise very healthy kid and now she suffers joint pain all the time. Ridiculous!!!!

19, 2, Intercostal Neuralgia,Nausea_ diarrhea_ anxiety,Took the 6 day dose pack. On the 3rd day started feeling a little off in the stomach. 4th day had nausea anytime I ate something and almost puked. Woke up that night with bad stomach cramps needing to go to the bathroom. Nausea started to subside by 5th day when I had to take only 2 pills_ but now I'm on the morning after my last dose and woke up again with bad cramps and a need to hit the head. Stomach is very uneasy with lots of peristalsis and gurgling going on. I have IBS and a sensitive stomach so I don't feel this medication was a good choice for me. Didn't really work too well on my pain as it's for inflammation_ not nerve pain. Will not take again_ and hope side effects do not last much longer.,M,38,6  days4MG,1/17/2016Email,Medrol
20, 3, Intractable Migraine,Some nausea_ light-headedness_ sleepiness_ sort of drunk/stoned feeling_ anxious.,I have mix-feelings about this medication. I was on a 6 day tapered dose pack for an intractable migraine after exhausting all other options including 2 ER trips the previous week. It definitely helped_ but not as well as I hoped. I was pretty loopy the first few days_ overly-talkative and energetic while feeling a bit wasted at the same time. I had zero appetite change and slept just fine which was awesome considering these are common side-effects. I decided to withstand the other stranger side-effects_ since none were life threatening and I was getting some relief. I also took pepto- bismol the first few days which definitely helped with the stomach upset. Definitely take with food and if you are sensitive to medications I'd be wary of driving the first few days.,F,44,6  days 6X O,1/15/2016,Medrol

28, 5, sinusitus_ bronchitis_ Poison ivy,I have taken this no less than 20 times in my lifetime for sinusitus_ bronchitis or poison ivy - always after other treatments failed to work.  I've never experienced problems and have always begun to improve on days 2 or 3. I think this is a great drug.  Before you damn your doctor about side effects_ consider that all these posts are probably the result of people having them and going on the internet and the vast majority of patients experience no significant issues and remain blissfully unaware.  I'm not saying your symptoms aren't real - I'm on this page because my wife is taking it and her face is flushing on day 2 - but for many of us_ the Medrol dose pack is great!,,M,50,6  days4MG 1X D,11/8/2015,Medrol

I felt like I have no control over myself. I stooped taking the med right away and now It has been 3 weeks that I stopped this med and I still feel weak and I can not handle any stressful situation yet.

30, 5, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease_ MS,about a 2 year weight gain.,This med helps to keep me mobile. It also helps with all of the inflammation in my body.

Violent mood swings come out of nowhere. I'm glad I don't have to return to work for another month while I recover from back surgery. It's been a week and a half since I stopped taking it on the fifth day and I still have side effects at random. I hope it stops soon. This stuff is basically toxic and is equivalent to torture.

35, 1, tooth pain,Chest pain_ shortness of breath_ dizziness_ rapid heart rate_ headache_ insomnia_ facial redness_ headache,I was prescribed the 6 day pack for tooth pain. I spaced the intervals on the first day_ two with breakfast_ one with lunch_ two with dinner_ and one before bed. By 5:30 in the evening after the first three_ my heart was racing_ the shortness of breath and chest tightness had kicked in full force. I wasn't sure what to do_ so I started reading online and kept coming to the consensus to not to stop taking the medicine. So I took the evening doses_ that's when the dizziness started up_ and I was awake until nearly 3am. On the second day_ I woke up with my face and neck all red_ I called the endodontist_ my doctor_ and pharmacist_ all said to quit taking it. I wish I had read more about side effects before taking the first dose_ I was just so desperate to get out of pain.

Overall_ while I was very productive at work and the pain lessened considerably_ there were some gastrointestinal side effects as well as a feeling of being sped up.

I am not very happy with my Doctor for not making it clear about these. Yes_ even madder at myself for not having read to RX sheet. I will never take this again.

Then my second time I only had crying/mood on third day.  This crying/mood on third day.  I had asked pharmacists if I could take it the first day two after each meal.  He said ok as long as I space it out.  The directions tell you before certain meals on empty stomachs.  Maybe you should change the directions after meals.

67, 1, Pain & inflammation post-surgery,Insomnia_ rapid heart rate_ diuretic_ sweating_ shivering_ sensitivity to heat/cold_ anxiety_ watery eyes.,This was the worst medication I've ever taken. It was like drinking 20 cups of coffee all at once.  I really have no idea why the 6 dose pack starts out with such a high dose for everyone_ and you are supposed to take all of it before bedtime.  There was no way I could sleep with my heart pounding at 100 bpm and having to urinate every 10-20 minutes. My body clearly wanted nothing to do with this drug.  After being up for 30 hours_ for the first time ever I went against my doctor's recommendation and quit taking it after day 1.  I took a benadryl and was able to sleep for about 3 hours_ then got through some nausea and anxiety in the evening.  By the morning of the next day (30 hours out of my system)_ I woke up feeling mostly okay.This is a powerful medication.

I used to have pressure and dizziness in my head as well as chest pain and they all go away when I pop a Medrol. But I have to keep taking it out my symptoms will come back.

My body must have been full of inflammation.,At least for me_ it had a good effect.  I didn't realize how tired I was.  Instead of being grouchy_ I actually felt so good I was nicer.

Never had an anger problem_ but got into major argument with wife and kids for no good reason.  Up and down with feeling good and feeling rotten.,After two days_ pain subsided.  Six days later_ pain is back_ but not as pronounced or widespread.  I guess the drug did its job to some degree_ but not enough for the sacrifices I made with my body to take this.

I will NEVER take this again_ and I will be tapering off drastically to get off of it permanently.  My ears are still ringing and may even be worse. This horrible drug has completely ruined my vacation.  Oddly_ taking prednisone 3_3_3_2_2_2_1_1_1_1 works FAR better and has zero side effects except hunger.  It is one thing to take dosepack for the first time and realize its not for you_ but for the doctor to tell me to try it again and that it would be fine was my own stupid fault for listening.  It is unfortunate that it helps a small minority of people since it is devastating to those who cannot take it without severe and extreme misery.  Useless drug.

139, 3, Inflammation - ac joints arthritis),"I have a/c joint arthritis and related shoulder problems from playing sports at a very high level for my whole life (competitive swimming was one - 16k yards a day practices_ etc). Then got blind sided in a driver side car accident which tweaked c5 c6 c7 in my neck and L1.  Medrol is a double edged sword. Reducing the inflammation and pain reduction was amazing - best I've felt in a while (physically). However_ mentally ""wow"" - you get a lot more alert and energetic but after the first day the racing thoughts and newly found vicious insomnia_ and I don't sleep well to start make you wish you never took it_ lol. I mean 4 days with maybe 2 hours of sleep tops - from just pure sleep deprevation/exhaustion leads to being anxious_ jittery and wanting to jump out of your skin - but you can't. You have to just ride it out. I'm apparently very sensitive to Medrol/steroids as I'd only taken 8 mg total in 2 days. I'd be more verbose but typing this on my phone. Net - pain wise - feel great but that insomnia_ inability to shut off mentally and the side effects that causes - like a bad chain reaction for days (longest days of your life or so it feels).  Hopefully this pain relief lasts a few weeks now that the insomnia has broken and related side effects have subsided_ making those miserable few days worth it.  So a 10/10 for pain relief but a -1 for the experience. There has to be something else out there that can reduce inflammation without the side effects that Medrol lend.",,M,39,2  days4 mg,7/8/2013Email,Medrol

Knowing that the medication you are taking could be the reason you are experiencing crippling anxiety/extreme irratibility/other depressive symptoms GREATLY reduces the impact these symptoms have on the patient.  I wish someone would've said ""don't be alarmed if you feel a little bit more irritable than normal for the next several days....it's common to experience some mood disturbance while on this medication but you should contact your doctor if it feels like it's influencing your mood too much.""  I had no idea what an impact it would have on my mental state so I assumed that my marked irritability_ quickness to anger_ and inability to calm myself down after becoming angry were entirely psychological and probably indicative of the need for psychiatric medication and/or therapy.

They keep changing....exp nausia too... It helps to take at least one dose with a bottle of boost and I am taking an antiacid tabs every 12 hours too.  I have never trusted generic and after this experience I know that I never will. I want off but the doc says have to taper off or serious side effects.  I think this product has too many side effects and potential for serious injury - was perscribed this at ER just two days after umbelical hernia surgery.   I would never want to take this again and would never want a loved one to have to take it ever.  It takes too much out of you  ....it is going to be a real challenge to complete the next three days.

209, 5, persistent cough after a cold,"Every year I get a nasty_ dry cough that lasts for months.  The doc gives me Albuterol which does nothing but make me feel ""spun"" and jittery so I usually ASK for the Medrol.  I take all six pills at once the first day_ all five pills at once the next day and so on until I'm done.  By day three my cough is already so much better I feel I can stop but I don't!  It cures the cough every single time!  The only mild side effect I have with Medrol is increased appetite and sleepiness.  Nothing I can't handle in other words.  It's so worth it.  Sometimes I'd have a rapid heart beat if I hit the Albuterol within an hour of taking Medrol but that subsides within an hour as well and Albuterol causes that problem all on its own most of the time so I don't ""blame"" it on the Medrol.  I have such great results with Medrol that I try to get the Dr. to give it to me every year around cold season so when my cough shows up I can just begin treatment.

217, 1, Pinced Nerve,Stomach Cramps_ easily irritated_ EXTREME MIGRAINE,I saw a nurse practioner in my doctor's office while he was on vacation for numbness on the right side of my left hand and she wanted to try this drug to see if the problem was just inflammation and not a pinced nerve. I had been on it before for nerve pain after a root canal but at a lower dose for fewer days and it worked so I agreed. I was taking an extreme amount compared to the first time and I didn't realize that until I picked up the prescription. Day 1 - 4 I was taking 2 before breakfast_ 1 after lunch_ 1 after dinner_ and 2 at bedtime. Day 5 -7 I was taking 1 before breakfast_ 1 after lunch_ 1 after dinner_ and 1 at bedtime. What started was being irritated easily and flying into a rage. Next came the stomach cramps which I was expecting but didn't last long only about a day. On day 3 I had a mild headache. It stayed with me from that day until day 7 when it became a full on hardcore Migraine. On a pain scale of 1-10 I was at a 50. I was able to cut the pain in half with 800mg of ibeprofren_ but when I took my next pill it ramped back up. I was unable to physically take the last pill of day 7_ I was supposed to be on it for 12 days. Its been a week and I still have the migraine. Was given a migraine shot and a shot for the sickness that comes with it. The shot for throwing up worked but the one for the actual migraine did not. Tried Taramol but that didn't work at all.

Unless these side effects are worth what you are taking it for_ I do not recommend it. This did not even take my back pain away.,F,21,6  days,1/22/2010Email,Medrol
246, 5, arthritis and back muscle spasms,I am taking the 6 day pack and I am now on my 5th day. I don't have any severe reaction... just itchy sensations on my legs and back. I have also noticed yesterday that my cheeks_ nose and chest (just below my neck) have a  redish hue. It has since subsided.,I have severe knee arthtitis and on the fourth day I was able to sit down and stand up without pain. I am delighted that for the first time in 2 years_ I can walk without my cane. I just hope that the medication will last long enough until I can get my knee replaced this summer. The medication also dulled the pain on my back. In addition_ it has given me relief from arthritis pain on my fingers and other joints.,F,54,6  days,1/19/2010,Medrol
247, 4, Lumbar disc,red face_ jittey_ racy feeling_ hunger,This medrol pack did more for me than the eidural injections.  The relief was wonderful.  It has lasted so far 2 weeks and was well worth the side effects which mostly occured the first 3 days at the higher dose.,F,64,6  days,1/10/2010,Medrol
248, 5, Gout,I am on unenployment_looking for H.V.A.C. work and couldnot walk.Used Indomethacin for flareups prevoisly.I have moved got another D.P.M. Was dreading more needles. She prescibed methylprednisolone dose pac . My results are positve for the gout attack.Being a sterroid I was expecting BEHAVIORAL side affacts. There are_ I am on my 4th day.Anger and Depression mostly. Some sleep irregularity.Appetite is ok_ seeing with gout one has to change there diet_to rabbit and lemure food_O.K.I wouldnt like being at work on this dose pack.,I was a succsessful choice for my gout flare up.I was moody anyway in pain_ watch out for mood crashes&peaks and try not to swear.,M,46,4  days,12/14/2009,Medrol
249, 4, possible herniated lumbar disk,bad headache_ insomnia_ speedy feeling_ mild euphoria and mood swings_ weight loss_ loss of appetite_ strange sensations_ dry mouth_ thirsty_ liked to talk a lot. Pain and numbness subsided by middle of third day.,I expected to have side effects and I expected them to be unpleasant. I took a pain killer (Tramadol) for the headaches and it also helped level my mood and helped me sleep. I tolerated this medicine and it worked to a degree but I would not want to take it again unless absolutely necessary. My discomfort from my back issue was debilitating but the Medrol made it bearable. I am on the last day and I continue to improve. This is not a cure. I think I will still need an epidural injection as I suspect severe stenosis. Plan to feel edgy/nervous_ moody and have a headache. I was fortunate that I was able to stay home while I was taking it. Ask the doctor for meds to counter act the worst of the side effects. My doctor was happy to provide them.,,45,6  days,11/9/2009,Medrol
250, 1, lower back pain from prostatitis,All the side effects_ couldn't sleep_ rising blood pressure_ water retention_ extended diaphagm_ skin dry or raw at underside of tip of penis_ night sweats_ didn't feel right,I quit taking this drug after 3 days as its side effects were pronounced immediately.  I had acute prostatits the week before which lead to severe strain on the lower back muscles which became inflamed. I was unable to walk or get up without considerable excuciating pain and took 4 days of bed rest with naproxen and soma to sleep to stablize and become ambulatory. Although modestly better after 4 days on anti-inflammatories_ methpac improved the symptons to an acceptable level but the downside was too severe with the side effects and after 2 nights of no sleep_ I called the doc and said that's it.  Went to soft touch chiropratic_ now in progress. Stable back now but acute prostatitis kicked in again _ now back on cipro for 3 days and back feels somewhat tenous although functional with no pain.  cipro alleviated prostate inflammation but have to worry about C-difficile requiring Flagyl to treat.,M,55,3  days,11/1/2009,Medrol
251, 1, spider bite,broke out in hives all over body_ had them for 3 days_ stopped taking medrol_ now withdrawing off of it. Very sleepy_ in a fog. I will never take again!!!,,F,29,3  days,10/27/2009,Medrol
252, 3, Bronchitus,sleeplessness_ tired but body wouldnt calm down_ Muscle pain at main joints,I understand the sleeplessness because in the tapered dose pak i had_ I ended up taking 11 pills in the course of 24 hours_ but the muscle wierdness was uncomfortable and just irritating_ something i didnt need as i was getting over bronchitus,F,25,6  days,10/13/2009,Medrol
253, 1, ruptured discs,After first day_ massive migraine...tried to combat w/water increase_ no luck..pressure behind eyes...NO PAIN RELIEF! Dr.'s you need to learn to LISTEN to your patients. THEY live in their bodies every day_ not you. Dr's too often react to patients saying the Rx didn't work as if the patient is the problem.,It's a steroid. I am not going to take this again. The impact on my pain was non-existant and instead I was made to feel worse_ ( migraine_ GI upset )_ and it only ADDED more things to deal with than I need. God forbid we Rx painkillers for PAIN ( eye roll ). Anti-inlammatories only work on inlammation which can cause pain BUT_ until the underlying cause of the inflammation is gone_ anti-inflammatories are temporary_ at best and tend to result in worse side effects than pain specific meds do. Look at the feedback for yourself: it's primarily negative.,F,38,5  days,7/31/2009,Medrol
254, 3, Psoriatic Arthritis,I must take it with food as it gives me heartburn. Some sleeping issues the first day taking it 24mg on the Dose pak. Seems to lose its effectiveness the second or third time I have taken it.,I have not gotten the chipmunk cheeks or weight gain on it but that is because its only a 6 day dose. Its works fine for what it does - stopping flareups quickly. I believe my body is getting used to it though - 3rd Medrol Pak in one year. Psoriasis is also a little better as well. Stop gap medicine but really you need to pick a long term therapy because your really should not be on medrol very long with all the side effects it has.,M,39,6  days,7/16/2009,Medrol
255, 3, Sciatica Pain,I have blurry vision upon waking up_ with dry eyes and very thirsty. Beyond that fairly normal,It did not help the pain at least after day one. I just took my first dose of day 2 (5 pills). I am spacing out the dosing throughout the day. I am also taking muscle relaxers to try to help ease the pain.,M,31,2  days,6/4/2009,Medrol
256, 3, neck pain,aggitated_ and angry but the pain subsided overnight,,F,40,6  days,4/22/2009,Medrol
257, 5, herniated disks,jittery_ angry_ bad sleep,have taken it 3 times for disk pain_ and it helped a lot within 2 days. Before this_ pain was very bad for weeks and I could barely straighten up,M,59,7  days,4/5/2009,Medrol
258, 2, skin rash,Feeling dopey_ dizzy_ unable to think straight.  Ringing in my ears_ extreme tiredness.,This is just the first day of the tapered dose pack.  But after research on side effects and how this drug works_ I've decided to stop taking it.  A skin rash is not so important that my body should be put in this state.  I'll rely on antihistamines and oatmeal baths. It's too strong in my opinion for the problem I have.,F,59,1  days,3/13/2009,Medrol
259, 2, Inflamation of cervical discs,Emotional roller-coaster with headaches and pressure behind the eyes.  Will not put this in my body any longer.  This is the end of day 2 and the last time I will take any of the pack.,Not going to take the rest of the cycle_ this is the end of day 2.,M,50,2  days,3/3/2009,Medrol
260, 3, Migraines,Achy joints,This is the second time I have taken medrol.  I am experiencing the same side effect as I did the first time.  The soreness begins on the first day_ and takes awhile to go away after I have completed the medication.,F,26,6  days,2/24/2009,Medrol
261, 4, chest congestion due to a cold,none,I am taking hte 4mg medrol dose pack.  I took all 6 at once the frist day with no problems.,M,62,6  days,1/2/2009,Medrol
262, 5, Arthritis-like symptoms_ joint pain,Some very minor sleep disturbance. Possibly fluid retention.,This drug is like putting water on a fire. I have taken it about four times in the last two years with great success each time. The relief last anywhere from 3-8 weeks and I feel great. No knee pain when stooping down_ no foot Plantar pain_ all joint pain gone. Feel like I'm 18 again.,M,50,4  times,12/30/2008,Medrol
263, 3, spinal stenosis,pressure behind my eyes_ sudden bouts of singing!,I only took the medpack. 6_5_4_3 a day and so on. On the morning after starting the pills_ I awoke amazed at my ability to walk around. The affect only lasted for those 6 days and I quickly regressed back to barely being able to walk.,M,55,6  days,7/30/2008Email,Medrol
264, 3, Neck & Shoulder Pain,Excessive hunger_ increased urination_ numbness/tingling in toes.,While on the 6-day pack I definitely felt relief from inflammatory pain but after day 3 it wasn't helping much.  The risks do not outweight the benefits with these types of meds.  The doctors tell you nothing_ you have to research yourself.  I don't think I'll try this again.,F,29,6  days,6/12/2008,Medrol
265, 3, Allergic reaction- ( itching ),Very high blood sugar_ high blood pressure_ anxiety_ weepy_ very nervous_ severe pain in my stomach_ crushing pain in my chest_ insomnia_ anger- and alot more.,I have taken Medrol Dose packs ( The 6 day pack that decreases pills every day) and NEVER had this happen to me before.  I don't know why I was so sick with it this time- but I thought I was having a heart attack.  I know it was my ulcer - that was very calm until I began this medicine.  As I said_ I have taken ths before without any reactions.  I will NOT TAKE it again.  Today was my last day--- just to take one and be done and I still feel like my stomach is swollen and I have severe stomach pains. I took this because my usual allergy pill did not help my itching and hives with all of the trees blossoming.  I think as bad as the itching was_ it was easier to cope with than this.  Please be careful.,F,57,6  days,5/1/2008,Medrol
266, 5, MS,I end up being wide awake day of drip_ don't sleep well that night_ then the next day I crash.  After that_ I am good to go for the rest of the month.  No longer get the munchies/hunger side effects_ I think I am more accustomed to the meds after being on monthly drips for over a year.,"Been my wonder ""fix"" for MS problems.  Gets my balance back and the funny MS wobble/gait problem evens out.  It also reduces the skin pain_ prickles_ burning sensation.",F,40, ,3/12/2008,Medrol
267, 4, Henoch Schonlein Purpura,While on high IV doses (solumedrol - 1000-100 mg)more easily agitated than usual .  Significant muscle loss though might have been from the hospitalization_ ulcers_ (and hospital food).While on oral medrol 64mg to 40mg currently have had headaches and blurry vision (halos around lights) on occasion when tired.,Also on pantoloc (stomach)_ imuran (last 6 weeks)_ actonel (bone density) + calcium supplements_ and ativan (sedative) on occasion.Have also had side effects more consistent with imuran that I've posted there.,M,34,9  weeks,2/14/2008,Medrol
268, 2, herniated disc,Everytime i've been on this stuff_ my face and other parts of my body tend to flush. Other than that_ i can't really think of any other side effects of this medication,This medication was worthless. I have been on it several different times and each and every time I don't experience any relief from my symptoms.,F,35,6  times,2/14/2008,Medrol
269, 1, neck pain - herniated disk,Psychotic behavior. Could not control my rage on day 3 of the dosage pack. It helped my neck_ but the cost was way too high. I wanted to inflict serious harm on a driver who had cut me off. Not my normal response. I was really afraid I would hurt someone.,Never again.,F,50,6  days,2/8/2008,Medrol
270, 1, RSD - swelling after surgery,Became more & more irritable & agitated to the point that by the end of the 6 day pak I was ready to rip somebody's face off. Also teeth felt like they wanted to come right out of my jaws. Horrible stuff,I sincerely believe that if I was given a choice of having to take this stuff again or die I'd just go ahead & say my goodbyes.,F,53,6  days,1/17/2008,Medrol
271, 1, severe lower back pain,Heated feeling in face and body_ both externally and internally_ persisting even after finishing pack a week ago. Dry_ bad taste in mouth_ no apetite_ lost 5 lbs in 1 week.  Did nothing for inflamation in back. Ended up with steroid injection.,"I had this med pack once before. Now I realize this ""heat"" symptom lasted for a LONG time...year or more. I thought it was pre-menopause_ rosacea...now I'm convinced it was this drug.",F,46,6  days,10/1/2007,Medrol
272, 5, Inflammation in right big toe.,None.,I am on the 6 day pack.  I felt relief after the very first dose.  I am day 4 and I hope it does not wear off.,F,47,6  days,6/17/2007,Medrol
273, 4, Brain Lupus,Too soon to tell_ other than increased hunger and thirst.,Too soon to tell_ so far so good as my sleep and clarity have improved.,M,38,3  months,4/27/2007Email,Medrol
274, 1, bunion pain and joint inflamation,continual migraine headache_ lack of apetite_ increasing depression_ ringing in ears_ blurry vision,I was given a Medrol pack....decreasing doses over 6 days (4mg pills)...to help alleviate inflamation in the big joint of my left big toe.  The first day you take 6 pills and decrease over the next five days.  I had THE worst migraine on the first day and it is day three and hasn't gone away yet.  I also experienced increasing depression_ blurry vision_ ringing in my ears_ and lack of apetite (which I don't need as I struggle to maintain 105 lbs at best!) I had to stop taking this stuff.  And_ I haven't seen much decrease in pain/inflamation in the joint.  As much as I tried to discuss my issues of bad side effects of medications with my doctor_ he still didn't listen to me and tried to deny any possible negative side effects of this medication.,F,42,3  days,4/11/2007,Medrol
275, 3, Respiratory virus,Bad indegestion_ female burning.,I was on the 4mg pack.  It made me feel a little better_ but I still am not sure why my doctor would give me something like this for a virus?  The side effects were not worth the benefit_ although I found that I had no tension in my neck for the first time in years while I was on it.,F,32,6  days,6/30/2006,Medrol
