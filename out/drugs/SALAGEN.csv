0, 4, Sjogrens,Severe sweating/hot flashes for at least the last 6 months.  Been taking Salagen for at least 4-5 years or longer.No side effects other than a runny nose for the first few years.,Not positive the hot flashes are from the Salagen. ??,F,63,1  days,2/2/2016Email,Salagen
1, 3, Dry mouth due to radiation,Mainly profuse sweating as well as chills and runny nose.,It definitely helps produce salvia and dry mouth. But the side effects are getting harder to deal with. However I'll continue taking it as I'd prefer the side effects over a dry mouth.,F,50,5  months5 mg 3x/da,4/23/2015,Salagen
2, 4, Sjogrens,For the first week I was warm but never really experienced the flushing. I do have more frequent urination.,Mouth would be so dry. Now I have saliva. I could sleep through the night if I did not have to urinate. This has been a great improvement.,F,53,2  months5 mg 5X D,11/23/2014Email,Salagen
3, 1, Dry mouth due to SSRI,Makes my throat feel restricted hard to sleep,,M,44,2  weeks5mg,2/6/2014Email,Salagen
4, 5, sjogrens syndrome,feel flush about 20 minutes after taking this medication.  makes you sweat and help with saliva and tear production.  I've also lost 15lbs since starting this medication.,It's a good idea to drink plenty of water while on this medication because it will cause you to sweat.  Before I started taking Salagen I had hardly any tears or saliva.  This drug is well worth the flush feeling.,F,31,1  years5mg 3X D,3/26/2011Email,Salagen
5, 4, SJOGREN'S SYNDROME/Dry Mouth,I haven't had any side effects which amazes me because I'm very ultra sensitive to medications. I'm taking one {4 times a day.} It helps to relieve my super dry mouth especially when I'm trying to have a conversation. I've had a dry mouth for so long it's a relief to have a normal amount of saliva. I've gone so long without having any saliva that it took me awhile to get use to having any. I had a huge grin on my face the other day while I was concentrating on my computer work because I actually drooled. Thankfully I was at home and not in public! There's nothing like a woman walking around town drooling with a big smile on her face. It's a blessing to have any sort of saliva. I feel badly for the people who have experienced side effects with this particular medication. I realize that no two bodies react the same_ but Salagen is working great for me. I would recommend this medication to others if they are able to tolerate it :-),I'm happy that Salagen works great for me!,F,60,1  months5mg 4X D,1/26/2011Email,Salagen
6, 2, Sjogrens and SLE Lupus,Profuse sweating - I had to change my clothes 3 times in one night. Chills_ head ache_ and hot flashes. Also_ one night I had so much saliva in my mouth that I woke up in the middle of the night choking on my own saliva. A very scary experience!,Just note that I am generally sensitive to medications that I take_ but I did not expect these side effects.,F,32,3  weeks5 MG 2X D,9/20/2010Email,Salagen
7, 2, Sjogren's,Strong pain in ducts on roof of mouth.  Right submandibular pain.  Difficulty swallowing.,I won't be taking it again.  Not sure what I'll do.,F,48,1  days5 mg 3X D,8/3/2010,Salagen
8, 5, cancer-post treatment effects,Initial dosage (while I was in radiation treatment)was 1 pill 3X per day. For the first few months I had flashes of sweating but adjusted. I am now (for several years)taking 1 pill 4 times per day. I have no adverse side effects.,"I had Stage IV throat cancer requiring surgical removal of the submandibular salivary gland (rt. side) and 7 weeks of radiation_ which greatly reduced the salivary function. I am quite dependent on Salagen at this point. My system has adjusted to ""expecting"" the boost to salivary function every 6 hours--for talking (I teach)_ eating_ living. My quality of life would not be good without Salagen. It has helped me a great deal.",F,67,12  years5 mg 4X D,4/6/2010,Salagen
9, 4, Dry mouth due to Sjogren's Syndrome,flushing and sweating briefly 20 minutes after taking it.,Works great for me.  I only wish that the effects were longer lasting.  Had to add a fourth dose to make things more comfortable.,M,37,2  years,3/2/2007,Salagen
10, 4, dry mouth,I take 10 mg when I wake up_ 5 mg in the afternoon_ and 5 mg at night.  I do experience (periodically) sweating in the morning about 20 minutes after I take them.  It only lasts about 10 minutes and then_ I'm fine.  There are no other side effects for me.,My life prior to being prescribed this medication was a ZERO on a 1 to 10 scale.  Talking was uncomfortable.  Kissing my husband_ out of the question_ life was miserable.  At first I was less than thrilled by the medication but I kept taking it.  After about 2 months_ it was miraculous.  Life was a 4 or 5 out of 10_ which anyone with a dry mouth will tell you is AWESOME.  Now_ I have been on it for 4 months and now it's a 6.  If it doesnt get any better than this_ that's fine.  I am happy_ able to talk_ sing_ kiss.....I will never again be without this medication.  I highly recommend it to EVERYONE.,F,47,121  days,1/5/2007Email,Salagen
11, 3, dry mouth_ no diganosis,Repeated hot flashes and sweating.,It is a sanity-saver when I can't stand the dry mouth any more or have to take part in a conversation. However_ the duration of the improved salivation is so short and the side effects are so unpleasant that I prefer not to take it regularly as prescribed (3 times per day).,F,58,6  months,1/5/2006,Salagen
12, 3, Sjogrens Syndrome,Hot flashes and profuse sweating_ starting about 20-30 minutes after taking the drug.  This is followed by chills since I'm so damp from the sweats!  The amount of saliva in my mouth does increase for awhile_ but initially the sensation is uncomfortably reminiscent of what one experiences with nausea prior to throwing up.  Not pleasant.  After about an hour of these sensations_ my body returns to,I take one 5mg Salagen tablet 3 times a day after meals. My Dr. would like me to add a 4th dose before bedtime_ but I doubt I can tolerate that since I would be taking it without having eaten a meal.  I really don't care for the side effects_ especially since I'm experiencing additional hot flashes the rest of the day due to menopause.,F,51,6  months,12/28/2004,Salagen
