0, 1, A-fib,Facial swelling_ my lips swelled_ tongue swelled_ eye lids swelled_ swelling under my eye_ testicles swelled. Weight gain. Fatigue. The swelling continues but not everyday.,I had a triple bypass 2 months ago. I was put on Amiodarone pacerone for afib. 3 wks ago I had facial swelling_ my lips swelled_ tongue swelled_ eye lids swelled_ swelling under my eye_ testicles swelled. Weight gain. Fatigue. After 2 trips to the ER and to my primary doctor & my cardiologist. No one could figure it out! My cardiologist took me off amiodarone pacerone. Still have afib. I've been off of it now for 2 wks. Still have swelling but not as much or everyday like I was. I'm told it takes months for it to get it out of your system. I'm currently taking probiotics to rebuild my immune system. I have come to the conclusion the less drugs u are on the better u will feel. I am feeling better not 100% yet but I'm getting there. I would not recommend this drug to anybody.,M,53,5  weeks200 1X D,7/10/2016Email,Pacerone
1, 1, afib,After starting on this drug_ every morning my thumbs were numb_ very sensitive_ and started to crack and split. The only other med I take is atenolol and I've taken that for over 5 yrs w/ no probs. Anyway my thumbs were in bad condition; had to keep them bandaged. They would heal a bit and then split open again. I couldn't think of anything else that was different in my routine_ so I have to blame it on the pacerone. Also_ I found out this drug builds up in your body over time.,,F,66,1  months 1X D,5/9/2015,Pacerone
