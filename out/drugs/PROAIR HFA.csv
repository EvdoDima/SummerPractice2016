0, 3, Allergies/bronchitis,Trembling_ Tachycardia_ headache_ nervousness/anxiety,So far this works for my particular use.  Doc prescribed for an as needed basis when my allergies flare up and I start wheezing.  It does give me a headache and shortly after inhaling my heart starts pounding like crazy and my hands tremble. Sometimes it feels like it makes my chest tighten up more_ but for the most part it does its job.  I just don't like the pounding heart and the tremors.,F,34,2  months90MCG 1X AN,6/8/2016,Proair hfa
1, 5, COPD (Emphysema),The only side effects I have are 1) my left hand shakes a little bit for about an hour_ and 2) I've developed a wheezing sound when I breathe occasionally--not often_ maybe 3 or 4 times a week for 5-15 minutes--but I never did any wheezing before. Also_ I just take 1 puff instead of 2 (the insert says 1 is ok). When I was taking 2_ it made my heart race; 1 doesn't.,This has been a wonderful drug for me. I'm very sensitive to medicines and usually get some bad side effects_ but this has caused almost no problems. And it really helps my breathing. Tried Symbicort and Spiriva (not rescue inhalers like ProAir)_ but they didn't help. I only take 1 puff of ProAir instead of the 2 recommended (the insert says you can just take 1) and it helps a lot. I use it 1-4 times daily.,F,59,6  months90 mcg 3X D,2/9/2012Email,Proair hfa
2, 4, Asthma,This worked fine for my acute asthma attacks (as opposed to MaxAir_ which made them worse).,ProAir worked fine for me (albuterol sulfate).  MaxAir actually made my breathing worse.,M,49,6  years90 mcg. 2X D,10/25/2011,Proair hfa
3, 5, Allergy Induced Asthma,Today is my first time taking this drug.  I normally do not suffer from asthma but do have severe allergies & this season in my area has been dreadful.  Anyway_ my doc gives me this Rx & I have to say it works_ however_ I notice that I feel like I am on speed and not sure if I will sleep tonight. However_ to be able to breathe again after 7 days of being in attack-hey I didn't know what it was. :-)  I'll take this speed like feeling over the way I felt previously.,Although I like this inhaler I hope it doesn't become part of my daily life as I am not a person who likes to take drugs.,F,40,1  days90mcg 4X D,6/29/2010Email,Proair hfa
