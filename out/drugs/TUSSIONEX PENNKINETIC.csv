1, 5, Sinus infection with horrible cough,Cough suppressed. Drowsiness.,This medication is Heaven sent! Tussionex suppresses your cough and then makes you really sleepy so you can just pass out to where you no longer cough. Every time I have a sinus infection my coughs are horrible and last for forever. Tussionex is the only medication that kills the cough and helps me sleep!,F,26,3  days,3/28/2015,Tussionex pennkinetic

7, 5, Pneumonia,Mild lightheadedness.,"My cough was deep_ painful_ & spastic. I coughed so badly I'd gag or wet my pants. It was bad! Tussionex eased the cough_ for sure. And it lasts. I was concerned that it said only ""twice daily""_ but that's all I needed. Although it didn't make me sleepy_ if I slept after taking it_ it was good_ deep sleep. I wouldn't drive while on it_ due to the lightheadedness. It is by far the best cough syrup I've ever seen. And it's tasty.",F,46,7  days1 teaspoon 2X D,9/27/2013Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
8, 5, persistent cough due to bad cold,No major negative side effects.  Feel relaxed.  Positive side effect:  calmed my cough approximately 30 minutes after taking the first dose.  Allowed me to (finally) lay down & read without violently coughing.  I'm on day 9 of a bad cold_ and I also have asthma.,"As mentioned in the ""Side Effects"" field_ today I am on day 9 of a bad cold.  I finally went to the doctor because I haven't been able to sleep due to violent coughing.  Sadly_ the doctor tried to give me antibiotics.  I refused them & said I only needed something to calm my cough so I could sleep at night.  Also have to use albuterol_ which I already had for my asthma.  Tussionex works.  I do not plan on taking the daytime dose because my cough isn't as bad when I'm not laying down.  It doesn't taste too bad_ and with my insurance the bottle cost $11.00.  Very satisfied.",F,46,1  days1 tsp 2X D,4/28/2013Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
9, 5, Respiratory Infection_ Dry Cough,You should never take cough medication with a very wet cough. You need to get that mucous out of your lungs and a cough suppressant will only extend this process.,Take as prescribed. I have never had any side effects. If you take too much - you are going to suffer the consequences. That is why they have a label on the bottle that you read to tell you how to take it. This is the best cough suppressant and antihistimine combination available. Most of the side effects reported here are due to the chlorpheniramine (antihistamine) - particularly have trouble urinating. They make prescription cough medications that contain codeine instead of hydrocodone. If you feel that your side effects are too much_ be smart and take something less potent.,F,41,2  days5 ml 2X D,3/29/2013Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

11, 5, Bronchitis relief,"Tussionex is probably one of if not THE best medicine out there if you're looking to soothe a persistent cough_ though be very careful when you take it. I took a bit more than prescribed for ""extra"" relief and ended up with a fast heartbeat and it was almost as if every few seconds I stopped breathing and would catch myself. Cold skin_ itching_ really difficult to use the restroom; Well_ THAT'S not gonna be happening again!

13, 5, Bronchitis and pneumonia,Best cough meds! Only one that works bc it is slow releasing. 2011 a generic form finally came out. Works the same but doesn't taste as good. I have been taking this drug for 14 yrs. the key is 20 mins before you take this drug go ahead and get in bed. Once you start feeling tired go to sleep and then you will find yourself in a deep sleep. Otherwise if you try fighting it by still working or laying there fighting it_ you will have more side effect issues. Like maybe more anxiety if you are prone to that. Restless sleep_ tossing and turning and feeling the heaviness on your body. Do not take this and think you can drive!!! I promise you this if you are coughing nonstop this will stop it within 5 mins. It will last anywhere from 8-10 hrs. It's liquid gold so once you get over your cold_ if you can keep the leftover - do!! Insurance will not allow for refills until the day yours expires. It is a narcotic. My doctor has known me for over 8 yrs and has seen nothing else work. I have severe lung issues. So when I start I get it in a bottle of 120 qty.  they can tell if a cough medicine is helping or not.,,F,39,2  months1 tsp,12/11/2012Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

16, 5, Strep with respiratory infection,Mildly drowsy_ but that's about all,OK_ for those of you reporting itchy skin_ vivid dreams_ sweating_ crawling out of your skin -  that is because you ARE TAKING TOO MUCH!  If you follow the directions on the bottle you won't experience that.  If you abuse it_ you're going to get all kinds of adverse and strange effects becaues it is A NARCOTIC!  Read the friggin label_ people!  People looking into this as a viable medication for getting rid of a nasty caugh so you can actually sleep should not be disuaded by the folks in this forum who took it to get high.,M,30,7  days1 TBSP 1X D,3/14/2012,Tussionex pennkinetic
17, 5, Cough due to allergies & asthma,No side effects really_ except that it typically quits working for me after 8 hours. It is the ONLY cough medicine that STOPS my cough. I've tried Cheratussin AC- might as well have taken water. Tessalon Perles are useless. Again_ Tussionex is the ONLY medicine that offers me relief. It cost me $61.00 for 90mL.,,F,25,4  days5mL 2x,2/29/2012,Tussionex pennkinetic
18, 5, Cough-pneumonia,Stops the cough asap. There is a generic tussionex out on the market that charges a normal prescription rate $10-20. Instead of $60-160. It doesn't taste as great but works just the same! I have been a tussionex customer for over 10yrs. Lol! I do not waste my time or money on the other stuff bc for 1 they taste horrible and 2 you have take three times as much bc it only last 4 hrs. So by the time you are feeling comfort from the meds it's time take another dose. With this stuff it lasts 12 hrs bc it is slow releasing! If you take more than a tsp you will most likely get the itchy head_ skin etc. No rash will appear just itches. Also you may have crazy dreams that make you talk in your sleep. I'm not a talker but if I take more than I'm suppose too my husband says he heard the funniest stuff bc I am out of it.  Again ask for the generic brand just came out is 2011,,F,38,7  days1/tsp 12hr,2/29/2012Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

20, 5, bronchial infection,I am sensitive to antihistamines so even though this medication_ like most codeine cough syrups_ worked for my cough and helped me relax and sleep_ I still woke up every hour and did not sleep deeply (I was in bed for 15 hours after taking it). This is the same effect as OTC sleep medications that are just repackaged antihistamines etc. (all not safe and ineffective). They make me sleepy but keep me from getting into a deep sleep_ why bother? I stay away from them. You will wake up with very dry mouth with this cough syrup so keep some water handy. No other side effects except I counted the hours for it to wear off so I could feel normal again. I will only take another teaspoon  if I am desperate for cough relief.,"Before taking this I was desperately ill. I had a temperature for 4 days at over 100 (at times) and I thought; ""I am actually gong to die"" as that is how a 102 temp feels. I had had no sleep. I went to the doctor and surprisingly I was able to get him to give me some codeine cough syrup_ as I was coughing so violently. I even threw up at the doctor office. They gave me a antibiotic shot too in my butt (that hurt like hell) and a prescription for Z Pak. Either way I took one teaspoon of the cough medicine and went to bed_ my stomach was so ""on the edge"" I was unable to take anything else for 15 hours. Today I am better_ think I am going to make it. The biggest issue I think is that a lack of sleep cause by violent coughing can magnify all your symptoms. Once this is addressed you will get some rest and feel much better. I don't feel like I have a lot of congestion.   ",M,52,1  days8-10 mg 1X D,1/6/2012Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

22, 4, Bronchiectasis & Tracheobronchomal,itching  sometimes.   sleepy_ dry mouth,This seems to be the only things that has helped my cough since I tried it. Tried all other cough syrups and none seemed to help. I must say that one time I took 1 tsp tussionex and one hydrocodone pill and that combination seems to work the best..   The cost of this medicine up here in Alaska is very expensive_ 8 oz. cost $230.49_ which will probably go up this next year.  I pick my times to take this med._ for social gatherings where I do not want my hacking or coughing fits to embarrass me to death. Also_ my doc informed me that the more I use it the less effect it can have on my cough.  I sure wish there was something stronger than this.  The lung disease that I have has no cure_ so with breathing devices and equipment plus tussionex_ I might just make it.  If someone out there has a very bad cough with a lot of mucus that does not go away_ I would suggest you be tested for this lung disease.   I might add that if you drive and are stopped you are driving under the influence of a narcotic.,F,62,1  years1 tsp 1X D,11/5/2011Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
23, 5, Cold/Flu,I was a little itchy_ and it gave me kind of a warm fuzzy feeling.,Tussionex is by far the best cough medicine I've ever taken. My doctor gives me it when ever I'm sick. I've had a couple of other different cough medicine's in the past but nothing that comes close to or compares to how well Tussionex works. If you have a bad cough that is keeping you up at night it's the only way to go. OTC cough medicine's usually don't work very well and are a waste of money_ so if your sick of hacking your brain's out then go see a doctor an get some Tussionex it works wonders.,M,32,5  days5 ml 2X D,10/25/2011,Tussionex pennkinetic
24, 5, ,A little Itching.,Tussionex is a miracle.I have been up for 4 days with coughing_ wheezing and drainage not being able to get a wink of sleep hardly until I was prescribed this. Tussionex cleared up my symptoms in less than a few hours. The only downside is after about 8 hrs it has stopped working and im a little leary on taking some more since it is pretty strong. All in all its a wonderful medication!,F,24,2  days5 ML 2X D,10/7/2011Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

27, 5, RADS -,Slight change in dream pattern_ also some noticable itchyness during the night.,I've been diagnosed with RADS - Reactive Airways Disfunction Syndrome - due to a work related accident that caused chemical burns and scarring of my bronchial tubes.  I have been prescribed mostly all the meds listed in other reviews. Including prednisone_ inhalers_ and Tessalon Perle.  Tussionex is the ONLY medicine that has worked for me.  Since I now have a chronic cough that will last a lifetime_ Tussionex has been a godsend. However_ I take it ONCE daily before bedtime or else I'm suffering with coughs and asthma-like attacks.  It stops my cough right in it's tracks.  It cannot be abused or it can cause other side effects listed here by others.  It is NOT cheap!  $187.00 a bottle at my pharmacy.  It does make me drowsy_ that's why I only take it at bedtime.  It is good tasting also.  I have noticed that I awake throughout the night in a dream like state_ always running my fingers through my hair.  ODD!!!  Because this works on the cough receptors in the brain_ I think these movements might have something to do with that.  I have to pick my battles_ it's either suffer with slightly wierd movements and dreams_ or asthma attacks that leave me breathless while I'm sleeping.  I choose Tussionex.  It's definately helped improve my quality of life!,F,44,3  years 1X D,8/13/2011Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
28, 5, chronic bronchitis,Can make me sleepy so I only use it at night.,I have had chronic coughs for years and I agree with many of the others - this stuff works.

29, 5, Chronic cough for two weeks prior,While tussionex completely knocked down the cough. prostrate problems came up and had to stop,Like I said Tussionex was working great and had to stop due to prostrate problems.  Dr. wouldn't prescribe another hydrocodone medicine so gave me tessalon pearls. To my supprise after two days I am getting some relief.  I just hope the cough hasn't just run its course.  I'll have to wait till this comes up again_ which will probably be in February or next summer. Cudos for Tussionex though.,M,60,2  days1 tsp 2X D,7/15/2011,Tussionex pennkinetic
30, 5, Severe cough fr/allergies bronchits,vivid dreams,"Like others here_ I too have a severe cough associated with allergies_ asthma_ bronchitis_ which I go through like clockwork about once a year.  Tussionex is the only cough med so far that  helps me stop coughing and sleep through the night.  I am very aware of the dependency risk due to the fact that it does contain narcotic ingredients_ so I only take it at night.  Tried other OTC meds for a few days between refills_ they didn't work_ but I didn't find myself ""jonesing"" for Tussionex",F,46,14  days1 tsp 1X D,5/24/2011,Tussionex pennkinetic
31, 4, Horrible Dry Cough,"Well_ I had a horrible dry cough_ so the Dr. gave me a RX for Tussionex. Went to Subway for dinner after we left the pharmacy_ didn't want to wait any longer_ got a spoon_ looked at the bottle quick and took 2 heaping teaspoonfuls. About 20 minutes later I was out of my element! I was in bed for the night with and itchy head and face_ and like someone else said_ while I was sleeping_ I kept half waking up_ like jerking awake_ it was WEIRD!!!! So tonight I go to take another dose_ I'm home_ so I look at the bottle more closely.....it says: ""Take 1 teaspoonful every 12 hours. Maximum daily dose 2 teaspoonfuls."" Wow!! I took waaaaaaaay to much. After taking what I am suppose to take_ I don't feel those effects.

33, 4, Cough& lack of sleep,Well_ I took three swallows straight from the bottle. I had that blazed feeling but i slept great. No cough_ just a dry mouth. My head felt really heavy. I woke up feeling great but about 8:30 the next morning_ I started feeling blazed again. I hadn't taken anymore that morning.

35, 4, deep cough and congestion/wheezing,the positives outweigh the negatives but there are some noticable side effects.  I am a big man (physically) and have a fairly high tolerance_ so I take approx. 3-4 tspns per day instead of 2.  The side effects are itching of my skin_ dry mouth_ constipation_ sudden jerking as if falling asleep suddenly.lost concentration.,It tastes good and has a fairly bright outlook.,M,51,7  daysone tspn 2X D,1/4/2011Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
36, 5, Bronchitis and sinus infection,I take 1 Tsp every 12 hours and the side effects are a slight itching (not too bothersome),I have had sinus infections and bronchitis regularly since 2008.  I have taken Tussionex and it is the only cough medicine that works for me.  I have tried Cheratussin_ OTC meds_ etc. and they do not work. My bronchitis gets so bad that I cannot lay down flat to sleep at night and must sit up in my rocking chair to try to sleep_ fluid builds up so deeply in my bronchial tubes that the coughing is like seizing attacks... However_ when I take Tussionex_ I can lay down to sleep_ the sinus congestion clears up and my urge to have coughing attacks is gone!  I told my husband that this stuff is expensive_ but it's Gold in a bottle for me.  My doctor prescribed me some more last week due to a sinus infection_ fever and bronchitis_ along with an inhaler.  Doctor even wrote me a refill for my Tussionex_ which surprised me a bit_ but she knows how bad I can get.  I only use it at night or if I have to work at school during the day (I substitute teach) or if I am going to be around others and don't want to have embarrassing_ uncontrollable coughing fits in front of them (which happens).  Anyway_ I highly recommend this medicine. It's only one that works for me. Amazing results and amazing relief.,F,42,  2X D,12/28/2010Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

I am not only on the Narcotic Hydrocodone which is found in this RX. I am also on Dilaudid_ Phentanyl and OxyContin.So back to the side effects. I am pretty sure that it is a combination of all of these Narcotics that have basically made me the junkie that I am. I hope for all of you in the world whether you are a good or bad person that you never have to go through this. However_ the Tussionex does help with the Naso.

Itchiness and ringing of ears if taken for longer than a week or if more than prescribed was taken (example_ taking 1 1/2 tsp instead of 1 tsp),I love Tussionex because it's the only cough syrup that's strong enough to keep my coughing at bay.  I have asthma and so when I get an upper respiratory infection (about once a year)_ I can sometimes get a cough that throws me into asthma attacks in the middle of the night. Tussionex is the only thing that keeps this from happening.  I could take it during the day if I wanted to but the side effects are just enough that it makes me uncomfortable to drive.  So I just take at night and deal with this cough during the day.  Overall_ great medication but USE WITH CAUTION.  If it does make you drowsy_ you may find after a week or more of use that you find it harder to get to sleep at night without it.  It is highly addictive so use EXACTLY as prescribed.  Also_ it can make you itchy all over (and you can't satisfy the itch) if you take a little too much so measure it.  And after a week or so you can find that there is a ringing in the ears.  After stopping_ it goes away. This medication is a godsend for people like me but you have to measure the risks and the rewards.  Overall_ it's worth it for me.,F,32,7  days30mg 1X D,11/14/2010,Tussionex pennkinetic
39, 5, Asthma,"It makes me a little light headed when I haven't taken it for a while_ but soon (after 2-3 doses) that no longer seems to be a problem.  Individuals react very differently to hydrocodone_ so many may feel more side effects or none at all.  some people even get ""wired"" instead of relaxed_ but most do not.",When my asthma is at it's worse_ usually early spring and all through the fall_ I use Tussionex as needed 1-2 times a day and have great results.  I seldom wake up at night coughing and though I may be a tad drowsy if I take it in the morning_ it is not too bad and really helps me stop coughing.  The Hydrocodone also helps relax me so I think this relaxes my inflamed airways and thus lessens my other asthma symptoms as well. Since people react differently to medicines and especially to hydrocodone_ this may not be for everyone_ but for me it is nearly a miracle drug.,M,53,5  years1 teaspoon 2X D,10/19/2010,Tussionex pennkinetic
40, 5, uncontrollable coughing,drowsiness,I swear by the stuff! Not a lot of Dr.s will prescribe the medication but when I have problems getting my coughing under control and trouble sleeping I do not hesitate to suggest it to either an emergency room doctor or any other that I happen to see including my primary care physician.  Do to severe asthma complications beginning when I was very young_ Tussionex was not first choice but when we found nothing else would work for me_ I began taking a small amount under my mothers constant supervision.  I swear by it now_ my family swears by it now.  Tussionex is very well known to cause dizziness and drowsiness_ however if you have uncontrollable coughing and an over the counter even less intense cough suppressant is not working_ you should probably be in bed sleeping anyhow.  I personally truly appreciated the way it allowed me to relax when I was sick_  I have been capable of getting well faster when hit with a cough since I have discovered Tussionex.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends!,F,23, 1 tsp 1X D,8/30/2010,Tussionex pennkinetic
41, 5, Uncontrolled Coughing since 2003,Side effects include slight insomnia if taken too late_ slight difficulty in remaining focused on specific tasks_ if taken and I have a drink with caffeine for some reason I get a huge energy boost - however_ when multi-tasking going back to completion of the specific task leaves many projects incomplete in the short-term.  Other side effect includes a slightly dry mouth and unusual sweating on only the right side of the face and neck_ lower left back and sometimes the back of the knees. When reading below ***NOTE  The section only allows for 1500 characters and I was a bit over  the following was omitted from the ending I am about 80lb overweight and my diaphragm causes pressure against the stomach.  Unfortunately I just cant afford it right now as I would love to be off this  I truly hope this helps anyone with my condition and may not know it.,A suggestion for people w/ chronic cough_ have yourself checked for Acid Reflux or GERD.  In 2003 I began an uncontrolled cough. The short is this  Ive been to 7-doctors.  2-Pulmonologists (Lung)_ 2-ENTs (Ear Nose & Throat) 2-Gastrointestinal Specialist and my Primary Dr.  Tests included_ 2-MRIs_ 1-CT Scan_ multiple X-rays of the chest_ throat and sinus area_ tons of blood work_ a bronchoscopy and finally an endoscopy.  All these doctors told me the same thing  good news was All the things we thought it could have been it isnt_ bad news was_ we still dont know why you are coughing. After 4-years I was sent to USC Med Center. The head of Gastroenterology put two probes up my nose down into the esophagus for 24-hours to monitor stomach gases.  A person with bad acid reflux normally has bad heartburn.  These people have between 30 - 45 episodes of acid reflux a day.  I have over 80 episodes a day but without heartburn so it confused the specialists.  The difference is that my condition only lets a little gas_ not stomach acid out into the esophagus causing a slight irritation.  As the gas leaks it is then inhaled.  The lungs try to protect the soft tissue of the lungs with mucus. With that and the esophagus irritation I get a persistent cough.   Tussionex closes off the sphincter muscle between the esophagus and the stomach stopping the cough dead.

47, 4, bronchitis,Felt light headed. Was lying in bed sick when I took it.  Didn't get up for a couple of hours and when I did I noticed that I was pretty woozy.  I looked at the label and it said take a teaspoon.  I had taken a tablespoon of it.  Misread on my part.  Guess you really need to be careful about following directions.  This is very potent medication.  I didn't take much more than the prescribed amount and it really made me feel light headed and spacey.  From the posts I'm reading about it on this site it sounds like some of you are chugging this stuff.  I would seriously not recommend that.  This medication is NOT something to play with.  I'm 220 lbs and just an additional teaspoon had me feeling like I could fall over.  I think there should be some stronger wording on the label about this medicine.  Don't be fooled just because it's cough syrup.  This is a narcotic and it will seriously mess up your day.,,M,39,1  days,1/12/2010Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

56, 5, chronic bronchitis,sleepiness,As others have stated_ this works when everything else fails. I've suffered through many bouts of bronchitis_ and it's a miserable experience. Tussionex is seriously the only thing that gets me through the pain and sleeplessness. I've not had any of the whacked side effects others have mentioned here_ but everyone is different and perhaps they just needed cut the dosage way_ way down.I just went to my doctor's office yesterday for yet another round of bronchitis_ and a new doctor sent me home with a 'lesser' cough syrup prescription. It was completely worthless and as a result I was up for hours_ and everything is now more painful. So_ yeah_ thanks for that_ doc. Needless to say I called back this morning for Tussionex and told them to stick with what WORKS. For doctors who are so 'afraid' of this stuff_ maybe they have personal issues that interfere with their judgment regarding others. Maybe they've never had chronic bronchitis or pneumonia and don't understand just how worthless the other cough remedies are. Whatever. It's ridiculous to expect someone else to suffer through when there is a solution.Someone mentioned earlier that they wish it came in generic form. YES_ it does.

Wired,My allergies get real bad about twice a year_ it causes me to have alot of nazal drainage_ which settle's in my chest or throat and it causes me to cough constantly just trying to get it out!! Gross but true! My doctor started me on a codine cough syurp that was awful almost made me throw up just smelling it. It was a cheap and stopped the cough but it was so nasty it would even make me sick several hours after I took it. I complained to my doctor about this and he finally prescribed Tussionex a couple of years ago. It stops my cough instantly . . but I can not sleep very well_ I doze off but wake every hour or less. I have very vivid crazy dreams not scarry but real busy that seem to last forever_ I mean I wake up from the dream and when I doze off again I go back to the same dream.. weird huh! But I will say I don't cough and that is my goal. Last wednesday I fell and brusied my ribs_ everytime I coughed I thought I was breaking something. I went to anothert doctor as this happened while I was at work. He prescribed Tussigon pills. I hadn't used the pills before tonight as I had some Tussionex left. I have taken 2 pills even though it said 1 every 4 hours I wanted to go to sleep and not wake till morning. But as you can tell I am up and semi wired as usual.

This is powerful stuff_ but it works!,Slept well and it made the severe coughing stop.  Read the pamphlet your pharmacist provides regarding the side effects before taking this_ and you'll be aware of what to expect.  If you have to be at work in the a.m._ take a smaller dose the previous night (and not too late) or you may be lightheaded till noon.  I was very happy with it_ as I had a gut-wrenching cough for weeks and nothing took care of it until I took Tussionex.

70, 5, flu,a little sleepy,Tussionex works but is expensive. The reason it is expensive it uses a delivery system that allows for the patient to take this medication every 12 hours. All liquid prescriptio_ narcotics are taken every 4 to 6 hours. The 12hr dosing actually will help reduce side effects. Tussionex only gives you 20mg a day of Hydrocodone when taking properly_ this is much less than other hydrocodone antitussives on the market that are dosed much more frequently.Also Tussionex is at least 4x more potent than Codeine based drugs_ hydrocodone and codeine are not the same. Hydrocodone is a much more effective cough suppresant than codeine. You also experience less side effects with hydrocodone than codeine.When taken properly tussionex is the safest and most effective cough medication available on the market today_ Remember always uses a dosage spoon that you can get from your pharmacist and NEVER use a household teaspoon. All teaspoons are not measured the same and can lead you to use to much medication. Hope this helps.,,,7  days,3/29/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic

Massive diarrhea after I discontinued use and flue like symptoms_ after tapering off slowly.  But I was on it for a long_ long time.,The only thing prescribed me that worked for my cough.  Allowed me to sleep good for the first time in ages.  It's a heavy duty narcotic cough syrup_ take appropriate precautions.  I was drinking a bottle of Dayquill/Nyquill and Delsum in about thee or four days with zero relief.  Pulmonologist finally put me on Tussionex after trying something called Tusson Pearls which had no effect.  Tussionex was the second Rx cough syrup_ tried something weaker before it with no relief.  Works like a charm and I can see why people get addicted to it.  I was on a prescribed 10ml every 12 hours because the cough was so bad from my lung problem.

One moment I feel normal.  The next I feel completely stoned and out of it.  I also get a little itchy with it but I have a sensitivity to codine so I suspect that's what it's from.  Not bad enough to keep me from taking it. I would recommend this but use caution when driving or doing anything that requires you to have to pay attention for safety.

Despite side effects_ I was able to sleep a full 8 hours.  Clorpheniramine is also in Dristan tablets_ but Tussionex contains about 4x the amount to really knock out what's ailing ya.  I LOVE the sweet lemon creme taste and the comforting numbing of my throat upon swallowing.  Throat relief is near-instant_ where ""sniffles"" should be gone by the time you wake up.  Do not even try to drive when on this medication_ because of the impairment of judgment being quite intense_ or just take a half-dose.  Also_ be certain to take time off from work.

People with extreme symptoms must have taken too much.  Take the prescribed dosage or less and you will feel fine the next day.

87, 5, pneumonia,euphoria; excitability; loss of appetite; dizziness; occasional restlessness; vivid dreams,Tussionex is the modern equivalent of old fashioned laudenum.  The majority of negative reports that it incurs are the result of a poor understanding of the drug via negligence of the doctor or pharmacist to explain that it contains a generous amount of hydrocodone.  When properly administered_ this syrup will allay all cough and lull the patient into a deep and restorative sleep.  It should be taken on a full stomach (as with all opiates_ to avoid nausea)_ and never in excess.  Unlike the obligatory labeled warnings of many weaker drugs_ all advisements associated with Tussionex should be heeded in ernest.  Locomotion or labor should not be attempted.  Under its influence_ the operation of machinary or motor vehicles should be completely out of the question.  Noticable tolerance will develop after the first few days of consistent dosing.

After reaching their destination_ Mom was moved around the house in a dining room chair. I also traveled to their location the next day and brought her wheeled companion chair. We would usually use that chair at times we would be engaged in extensive walking. It took Mom several days to recover her normal abilities. She will never take Tussionex again.

95, 1, Severe cough; pneumonia,It worked. My mother gave me a single teaspoon to take to quiet my coughing_ as I was having coughing fits every minute and it was very painful. Soon I had stopped. And at first it was all right; I started to feel warm and comfortable_ and figured I might as well sleep and finally get a good night's rest. But it was one of the worst nights of my life! I tossed and turned in a half-awake state for most of the night_ experiencing terrible feelings of fear_ dread_ and paranoia over unrealistic things [such as my bed causing me to go blind]_ as if I were on a bad LSD trip. When I did fully fall asleep_ I was plagued by vivid nightmares that seemed to last for days.,No wonder why doctors are so reluctant to give this out. It's dangerous!,F,17,1  days,12/5/2008,Tussionex pennkinetic

97, 4, Upper Resp. Infection; COUGH,SEVERE itching.  Had to take benadryl to get some relief.  Drowsiness_ heavy euphoric feeling. Dizziness.  Urinary retention.,This medicine did help my cough_ which was driving me crazy.  It's a good product if you can put up with all the side effects.  I thought when the pharmacist told me it would impair my judgement_ he was just saying that as a precaution.  This medicine_ in my opinion is just like taking hydrocodone. If I didnt know any better_ I would think it was. But_ it helps the cough.,F,19,1  days,11/8/2008Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

Started off as bad cold and within 3 days I developed a sinus infection (customary for me)..went to DR._ got antibiotics for sinus_ shot of prednisone_ and was taking OTC Benedryl (which hypes me up)...developed cough and it settled into chest 2 days after DR. visit. Horrible cough_ could not sleep_ wheezing_ rattling_ ribs and back hurt tremendously_ had coughing attacks and would pee (thanks childbirth)...just absolutely miserable. Dr. called in Rx for Tussionex...paid $50.00 with good insurance..but was well worth every penny so far. Just took first initial dose about 8 hours ago_ feel very calm...very calm. ribs and chest/back muscles are not screaming out in pain...for some relief. Coughing very little_ and when i do..it is manageable. Cough syrup is thick_ but has hardly any taste..very pleasant..doesn't make you scrunch up face and hop around when it hits your tastebuds like some others. So far..I love it !!!!,F,40,1  days,10/26/2008,Tussionex pennkinetic
100, 4, Dry Itchy Persistent Cough,Extreme dizziness_ mild nausea_ anxiety_ Dry mouth_ itchiness all over,I've taken this before and knew it would work for my cough.  My mistake this time is that I didn't use a measuring cup to measure out my dose and may have taken a little too much.  I couldn't stop coughing when going to bed so got up to take it.  I stopped coughing immediatel and fell asleep.  If you can believe it_ the feeling of dizziness and nausea woke me up.  I got up to drink some water_ and the dizziness really hit me.  I had to call for my husband to carry me back to bed because I couldn't hold myself upwhile walking back to bed.  I wanted more water the rest of the night but was too scared to get up again.  I fell in and out of sleep all night_ was itching all over.  I don't recall feeling itchy the times I took this before.   I finally got a good 2 solid hours of sleep before having to get up.  By then it was 7 hours after taking the medicine.  I wasn't feeling quite back to normal but was ok_ just felt very tired.  I struggled to stay awake while driving to work.

Husband took me to the ER_ I couldn't put my shoes on_ slurred my words_ in and out of consciousness.,I took the recommended dosage_ 1 tsp before bedtime.  I took it at 8-9PM but the symptoms didn't hit me until 7-8 hours later_ I believe this is an extended release formula_ so that may have had something to do with it.

102, 5, Upper respiratory infection,Drowsiness_ slight euphoria,Every time I get a head cold_ it seems to always settle into my chest after 3-4 days_ and I can almost bet on several consecutive nights of unrest due to hacking cough.  This happened last year_ and having no luck at my Primary Care MD_ who told me to take OTC Robitussin and Ibuprofen_ I ended up in the ER unable to take it any more.  The ER doctor prescribed an inhaler and Tussionex.  After the first dose_ I was amazed. I didn't cough from 10 minutes after the dose until about 18 hours later_ when I needed another dose.  I used it for about 5 nights and finally my cough went away.  Again_ two nights ago I started with the coughing and sleeplessness -- went to my PCP yesterday_ asked for the Tussionex (had saved the bottle from last year) and she wrote it up for me no problem.

I have a stuffed dragon in my room that a friend gave me_ and the hallucination/dream I had was that he was actually moving around...I couldn't tell if I was asleep or hallucinating though.

Collapsed on toilet and nearly limp until stirred conscious by husband and assisted to bed.,This happened to my mom as relayed to me by my dad.  He called me at 5:00 a.m. after getting her back to bed expressing concern about what had happened.  In retrospect I should have had him call 911. He had been up all night monitoring her breathing.  No warning from doctor or pharmacist about how precisely the dosage needs to be measured (she used a teaspoon and web sites warn strongly against that). She may have overdosed but considering she is 83_ this may be entirely too strong for her age and physical condition (135 lbs). This med may be too strong for many people (see below) and should be substituted with something more mild or lower dose initially to see reaction. Check out the FDA warnings issued in March 2008 (http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01805.html) and any more issued recently before using.

118, 5, terrible cough keeping me awake,none.  just doctor reluctance to prescribe because considered narcotic.,this is a superb cough medicine.  for anyone who has had a persistant dry or wet cough that won't stop at night (like a previous poster_ I was coughing so hard I was throwing up) this medicine stops the coughing and helps you sleep.  Word of advice: take the medicine as prescribed to avoid side effects.  If you generally don't take medicines or are sensitive to side effects (this has an antihistimine ie: constipation_ dry mouth etc)_ half the dose intially and wait a few hours to see it helps with cough.  Generally speaking this will make it more tolerable.  Worth the cost!!!!,F,38,2  days,3/6/2008,Tussionex pennkinetic

Side effects - Doctors are VERY reluctant to prescribe.  I suffered no real side effects from the med. Only ""front"" side-effects from my docs reaction to the advent of having to prescribe a real narcotic.",Several years ago_ I had Tussionex (From another doctor).

If you have a problem with Vicodan_ or Lorcet_ you more than likely will have a problem with this medication_ as it is a semisyntheic opiod.  This medication is expensive_ but if used as directed by your healthcare professional_ you will get the benefits for the money.  It is a kinnetic medication_ meaning that it is chemically structured to be ""time released"".  Most other narcotic cough medications are prescribed for use every 4-6 hrs. PRN.  Several patients experience nausea and/or vomiting from Hydrocodone_ while some patients (me included) have no SIGNIFICANT side effects.  If you are not used to taking Hydrocodone_ or have NEVER taken Hydrocodone_ you will more than likely be lethargic and feel the extreme euphoria.

Since it is a narcotic_ they are very careful about prescribing this_ and rightfully so_ of course. I probably on avareage have used this once/year for the past 5 years or so. I swear by the stuff.

I get bronchitis several times a year and also have asthma so this is prescribed to me every couple months. Works almost immediatly_ you can actually feel it start to work in as little as 10 minutes. I noticed some people say it makes then sleepy but it gives me almost unstopable energy and a feeling of euphoria. Makes you feel like you can do anything. I can clean my entire house on 1 teaspoon of this stuff! I have no trouble going to work on this medication or driving. If anything it just makes me more productive. It also masks any other sniffle or pain you may be having. You just feel great! However_ yes you must be careful as this is extremly addictive because when taking it you feel so happy and nothing bothers you that you never want the feeling to go away.

People cannot take it even in the smallest of doses and be able to function. I feel so lethargic_ hallucinating_ eyelids closing.,F,45,1  days,10/3/2007Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
145, 5, cough,Sometimes keeps me awake at night_ dry mouth_ constipation,I have taken it for many years.  It is the only thing that works to stop my coughing and I have tried everything else.  It makes me drowsy and relaxed_ but keeps me awake.  I take it only when my cough is bad enough.  The awake at night feeling is more of an awake-dream state (hard to explain).  I still get rest_ just no sleep.  The benefits of no coughing far outweigh the side-effects of no sleep.  I'll choose Tussionex everytime I have a cough!  It's worth a try for anyone who has problems with a cough (it's a miracle cough medicine).,F,54,3  days,9/19/2007,Tussionex pennkinetic
146, 1, Pneumonia,Hallucinations_ high anxiety_ panic attacks_ racing heart_ dread_ and insomnia.,My doctor prescribed Tussionex and Biaxin for the pneumonia.  I felt very sedated the first couple of days_ and by the 3rd day I was having the effects described to the left of this box.  I can't tell if those effects were the Biaxin_ the Tussionex_ or the combination.  My doctor told me to stop taking Tussionex and I haven't had the same intense effects_ but I have had similar feelings of insomnia and anxiety.  Hard to tell but I will never ever take Tussionex again that's for sure.  I'm surprised how many people here say it is so good.  Maybe I'm an odd one.,M,28,3  days,8/22/2007Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

Everytime my wife has a cough_ I get excited because I know she'll be bringing home a fresh bottle.  I always joke and ask her to ask for the ""family size"" bottle.  Unfortunately for me_ I haven't had a cough in years!  But remembering how good it was_ I sometimes steal a sip just to get that feeling for a night.

152, 4, Bronchitis,Euphoric Feeling_ Energetic_ after 3 days depression,I am writing an honest review about this medicine. It definitely did the trick in helping with my cough.  However_ I noticed that my being able to function started to depend on me taking this medicine.  I would take more than the recommended dosage (no itching or rash).  I felt WONDERFUL!!!  I even lied to my doctor and told them that I lost my bottle so that I could get another perscription.  I have now been off of the medicine for 1 week and am JUST starting to get back to normal.  I was severely depressed for 5 days ... crying non-stop_ feeling hopeless and gloomy.  Please be careful when taking this medication.,F,28,2  weeks,5/15/2007,Tussionex pennkinetic
153, 4, nighttime cough,totally zoned out_ but enjoyed it nonetheless,initially i tried to not take my prescription at all due to a general wariness of pharmaceuticals_ but after 3 days of hacking and no sleep at all from the cough_ i broke down in a fit of irritibility and took way too much_ maybe a 6x dose or so.  BE CAREFUL!  i ended up missing 3 days of school_ the first 1 1/2 of those in and out of sleep and totally but pleasantly dissociated.  i had to deal with the repercussions of that of course and it was difficult_ but the medicine itself stopped the cough_ caught me up on sleep_ and only produced pleasant sensations.  my fiancee was there to drive and get food_ etc. where i definitely could not.  if you are alone_ watch your dose carefully!  the only side effect i noticed was a weak gut motility manifesting as minor constipation for about 36 hours or so.  in retrospect i'm glad to have hit it once hard rather than low doses over a period of time... it's addictive (narcotic) and i may not do so well with that.,M,38,3  times,5/12/2007,Tussionex pennkinetic

I was skeptical_ but boy does this stuff work.  Now_ granted_ I am writing this at 2:30 because I only got five hours contonuous sleep because the drugs *does* cause mild insomnia_ but hey.. so was my cough_ and to a *much* greater degree.  Highly recommended_ but use responsibly.,,F,30,1  days,4/21/2007,Tussionex pennkinetic

But definitely makes you sleepy and I didn't like my dreams. And I wouldn't recommend driving long distances. But I loved the fact that I was able to sleep and I liked feeling more relaxed since I'm an anxious person.

If you are using it as directed and for what it is prescribed for and not just to get high_ you will not get addicted and you will not notice a lot of the side effects.  For those who don't understand why MDs are reluctant to prescribe it: some people abuse this drug by lacing marijuana with it or by taking more than the recommended dose.   There are always those greedy people out there that ruin things for people who really need and benefit from something.,F,31,2  weeks,2/12/2007,Tussionex pennkinetic

After trying many different medications over the years from Demerol-Morphine-Paregoric-Dilaudid_Bentyl_Imodium etc_  we discovered that by taking 2-3 tsp daily all of my intestinal problems and severe pain is gone with no constipation whatsoever and no longer have to take zyrtec_ativan or antidepressant or pain pills.I haven't had a cold in 2 years and sleep like a baby everynight.I no longer have anxiety or depression and now have normal bowel movements.

203, 4, hacking uncontrollable cough,drowsy_,great medicine. have a chronic cough that keeps me up at night when I have attacks. This medicine allowed me to function. Much better than codeine/guafensin_,F,27,2  days,1/14/2005,Tussionex pennkinetic
204, 5, coughing at night,euphoria_ increased sexual drive (??),Best cough medicine I have ever taken.  In fact_ the only one I have ever taken that actually allows me to sleep at night when I have a cough to deal with.  I have taken the medicine on a  few cycles over the last two years.  With two small children_ colds are commonplace in my home.  Only negative is that the stuff is almost too good because you will feel the effects.  In other words_ you will like the medicine!,M,39, ,12/29/2004,Tussionex pennkinetic
205, 5, Cough and Congestion,None,Make sure you shake well before using. The best cough medicine a M.D. can prescribe. Excellent taste. It is very expensive. 6 ounces cost me 95 dollars. Don't try walgreens they wanted 108 dollars. Try Walmart or K mart for best price. Would recomend if ever in canada go in and see a M.D. and ask him to write you a prescription. He will only charge 30 for office call and the prescription will only cost 38 dollars to get filled for 6 ounces. Be also advised it is still available in tablets in canada. Tablets were discontinued in U.S. back in 1987. Doesn't come in generic and never will because the manufacturer has patient on the manufacturing process for politrex medications.,,, ,12/28/2004,Tussionex pennkinetic
206, 5, very bad night cough/congestion,drowsiness_ dry mouth_ little appetite,It works! The best drug that works against my cough. I had given up on cough meds because codine didn't do the trick. The sleepiness is was OK because I had been up about a week with little sleep_ due to the cough.It's expensive and no generics are available_ but it works much better than hydrocodone/homatropine mixes for me. I think it is the extended time release -- I could feel it kicking in several times over the 12 hours.Before when I've taken hydrocondone/homoatropine_ I felt paranoid/anxious -- but not with this stuff.,F,47,2  weeks,11/30/2004,Tussionex pennkinetic
207, 5, Cough and congestion.,Experienced moderate drowsiness when taking the recommended dose of 1 tsp every 12 hours.  Drowsiness increased if more was taken.  Constipation is a common side effect_ because it contains hydrocodone_ a mild narcotic....which also gives some desired side effects: euphoria_ lethargy.  Definitely helps with the aches and pains associated with a cold or flu.,Tussionex is a very effective cough suppressant and antihistamine for colds and allergies.  Although there are other similar brands_ this is one of the better ones I believe.,M,27,14  days,11/28/2004Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

211, 5, night cough,Slight drowsiness.,A one teaspoon dose lasts the night and enbales me to get a good night's sleep.  At $16/oz it is very expensive.  Would be great if a generic substitute were available,M,59,5  days,10/14/2004,Tussionex pennkinetic
