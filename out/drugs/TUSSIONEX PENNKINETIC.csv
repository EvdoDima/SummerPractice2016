1, 5, Sinus infection with horrible cough,Cough suppressed. Drowsiness.,This medication is Heaven sent! Tussionex suppresses your cough and then makes you really sleepy so you can just pass out to where you no longer cough. Every time I have a sinus infection my coughs are horrible and last for forever. Tussionex is the only medication that kills the cough and helps me sleep!,F,26,3  days,3/28/2015,Tussionex pennkinetic

7, 5, Pneumonia,Mild lightheadedness.,"My cough was deep_ painful_ & spastic. I coughed so badly I'd gag or wet my pants. It was bad! Tussionex eased the cough_ for sure. And it lasts. I was concerned that it said only ""twice daily""_ but that's all I needed. Although it didn't make me sleepy_ if I slept after taking it_ it was good_ deep sleep. I wouldn't drive while on it_ due to the lightheadedness. It is by far the best cough syrup I've ever seen. And it's tasty.",F,46,7  days1 teaspoon 2X D,9/27/2013Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
8, 5, persistent cough due to bad cold,No major negative side effects.  Feel relaxed.  Positive side effect:  calmed my cough approximately 30 minutes after taking the first dose.  Allowed me to (finally) lay down & read without violently coughing.  I'm on day 9 of a bad cold_ and I also have asthma.,"As mentioned in the ""Side Effects"" field_ today I am on day 9 of a bad cold.  I finally went to the doctor because I haven't been able to sleep due to violent coughing.  Sadly_ the doctor tried to give me antibiotics.  I refused them & said I only needed something to calm my cough so I could sleep at night.  Also have to use albuterol_ which I already had for my asthma.  Tussionex works.  I do not plan on taking the daytime dose because my cough isn't as bad when I'm not laying down.  It doesn't taste too bad_ and with my insurance the bottle cost $11.00.  Very satisfied.",F,46,1  days1 tsp 2X D,4/28/2013Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
9, 5, Respiratory Infection_ Dry Cough,You should never take cough medication with a very wet cough. You need to get that mucous out of your lungs and a cough suppressant will only extend this process.,Take as prescribed. I have never had any side effects. If you take too much - you are going to suffer the consequences. That is why they have a label on the bottle that you read to tell you how to take it. This is the best cough suppressant and antihistimine combination available. Most of the side effects reported here are due to the chlorpheniramine (antihistamine) - particularly have trouble urinating. They make prescription cough medications that contain codeine instead of hydrocodone. If you feel that your side effects are too much_ be smart and take something less potent.,F,41,2  days5 ml 2X D,3/29/2013Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

11, 5, Bronchitis relief,"Tussionex is probably one of if not THE best medicine out there if you're looking to soothe a persistent cough_ though be very careful when you take it. I took a bit more than prescribed for ""extra"" relief and ended up with a fast heartbeat and it was almost as if every few seconds I stopped breathing and would catch myself. Cold skin_ itching_ really difficult to use the restroom; Well_ THAT'S not gonna be happening again! Definitely does the job and doesn't taste too shabby either.",,F,18,3  days,1/11/2013,Tussionex pennkinetic
12, 3, Very long harsh cough.,My doctor overprescribed the medicine_ it works great_ but he kinda screwed me. He told me to take 2 tsp every 8 hours... when the MAX dose is 2 tsp in 24 hours. He gave me 2 refills_ so 8 days after my 240ml bottle is empty i request a refill and the pharmacist refuses to fill it.

13, 5, Bronchitis and pneumonia,Best cough meds! Only one that works bc it is slow releasing. 2011 a generic form finally came out. Works the same but doesn't taste as good. I have been taking this drug for 14 yrs. the key is 20 mins before you take this drug go ahead and get in bed. Once you start feeling tired go to sleep and then you will find yourself in a deep sleep. Otherwise if you try fighting it by still working or laying there fighting it_ you will have more side effect issues. Like maybe more anxiety if you are prone to that. Restless sleep_ tossing and turning and feeling the heaviness on your body. Do not take this and think you can drive!!! I promise you this if you are coughing nonstop this will stop it within 5 mins. It will last anywhere from 8-10 hrs. It's liquid gold so once you get over your cold_ if you can keep the leftover - do!! Insurance will not allow for refills until the day yours expires. It is a narcotic. My doctor has known me for over 8 yrs and has seen nothing else work. I have severe lung issues. So when I start I get it in a bottle of 120 qty.  they can tell if a cough medicine is helping or not.,,F,39,2  months1 tsp,12/11/2012Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

16, 5, Strep with respiratory infection,Mildly drowsy_ but that's about all,OK_ for those of you reporting itchy skin_ vivid dreams_ sweating_ crawling out of your skin -  that is because you ARE TAKING TOO MUCH!  If you follow the directions on the bottle you won't experience that.  If you abuse it_ you're going to get all kinds of adverse and strange effects becaues it is A NARCOTIC!  Read the friggin label_ people!  People looking into this as a viable medication for getting rid of a nasty caugh so you can actually sleep should not be disuaded by the folks in this forum who took it to get high.,M,30,7  days1 TBSP 1X D,3/14/2012,Tussionex pennkinetic
17, 5, Cough due to allergies & asthma,No side effects really_ except that it typically quits working for me after 8 hours. It is the ONLY cough medicine that STOPS my cough. I've tried Cheratussin AC- might as well have taken water. Tessalon Perles are useless. Again_ Tussionex is the ONLY medicine that offers me relief. It cost me $61.00 for 90mL.,,F,25,4  days5mL 2x,2/29/2012,Tussionex pennkinetic
18, 5, Cough-pneumonia,Stops the cough asap. There is a generic tussionex out on the market that charges a normal prescription rate $10-20. Instead of $60-160. It doesn't taste as great but works just the same! I have been a tussionex customer for over 10yrs. Lol! I do not waste my time or money on the other stuff bc for 1 they taste horrible and 2 you have take three times as much bc it only last 4 hrs. So by the time you are feeling comfort from the meds it's time take another dose. With this stuff it lasts 12 hrs bc it is slow releasing! If you take more than a tsp you will most likely get the itchy head_ skin etc. No rash will appear just itches. Also you may have crazy dreams that make you talk in your sleep. I'm not a talker but if I take more than I'm suppose too my husband says he heard the funniest stuff bc I am out of it.  Again ask for the generic brand just came out is 2011,,F,38,7  days1/tsp 12hr,2/29/2012Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
19, 5, copd exacerbation,easily distracted - unable to concentratedrowsy to the point of needing nap when taking during day several times,this medicine WORKS!

20, 5, bronchial infection,I am sensitive to antihistamines so even though this medication_ like most codeine cough syrups_ worked for my cough and helped me relax and sleep_ I still woke up every hour and did not sleep deeply (I was in bed for 15 hours after taking it). This is the same effect as OTC sleep medications that are just repackaged antihistamines etc. (all not safe and ineffective). They make me sleepy but keep me from getting into a deep sleep_ why bother? I stay away from them. You will wake up with very dry mouth with this cough syrup so keep some water handy. No other side effects except I counted the hours for it to wear off so I could feel normal again. I will only take another teaspoon  if I am desperate for cough relief.,"Before taking this I was desperately ill. I had a temperature for 4 days at over 100 (at times) and I thought; ""I am actually gong to die"" as that is how a 102 temp feels. I had had no sleep. I went to the doctor and surprisingly I was able to get him to give me some codeine cough syrup_ as I was coughing so violently. I even threw up at the doctor office. They gave me a antibiotic shot too in my butt (that hurt like hell) and a prescription for Z Pak. Either way I took one teaspoon of the cough medicine and went to bed_ my stomach was so ""on the edge"" I was unable to take anything else for 15 hours. Today I am better_ think I am going to make it. The biggest issue I think is that a lack of sleep cause by violent coughing can magnify all your symptoms. Once this is addressed you will get some rest and feel much better. I don't feel like I have a lot of congestion.   ",M,52,1  days8-10 mg 1X D,1/6/2012Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

22, 4, Bronchiectasis & Tracheobronchomal,itching  sometimes.   sleepy_ dry mouth,This seems to be the only things that has helped my cough since I tried it. Tried all other cough syrups and none seemed to help. I must say that one time I took 1 tsp tussionex and one hydrocodone pill and that combination seems to work the best..   The cost of this medicine up here in Alaska is very expensive_ 8 oz. cost $230.49_ which will probably go up this next year.  I pick my times to take this med._ for social gatherings where I do not want my hacking or coughing fits to embarrass me to death. Also_ my doc informed me that the more I use it the less effect it can have on my cough.  I sure wish there was something stronger than this.  The lung disease that I have has no cure_ so with breathing devices and equipment plus tussionex_ I might just make it.  If someone out there has a very bad cough with a lot of mucus that does not go away_ I would suggest you be tested for this lung disease.   I might add that if you drive and are stopped you are driving under the influence of a narcotic.,F,62,1  years1 tsp 1X D,11/5/2011Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
23, 5, Cold/Flu,I was a little itchy_ and it gave me kind of a warm fuzzy feeling.,Tussionex is by far the best cough medicine I've ever taken. My doctor gives me it when ever I'm sick. I've had a couple of other different cough medicine's in the past but nothing that comes close to or compares to how well Tussionex works. If you have a bad cough that is keeping you up at night it's the only way to go. OTC cough medicine's usually don't work very well and are a waste of money_ so if your sick of hacking your brain's out then go see a doctor an get some Tussionex it works wonders.,M,32,5  days5 ml 2X D,10/25/2011,Tussionex pennkinetic
24, 5, ,A little Itching.,Tussionex is a miracle.I have been up for 4 days with coughing_ wheezing and drainage not being able to get a wink of sleep hardly until I was prescribed this. Tussionex cleared up my symptoms in less than a few hours. The only downside is after about 8 hrs it has stopped working and im a little leary on taking some more since it is pretty strong. All in all its a wonderful medication!,F,24,2  days5 ML 2X D,10/7/2011Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

27, 5, RADS -,Slight change in dream pattern_ also some noticable itchyness during the night.,I've been diagnosed with RADS - Reactive Airways Disfunction Syndrome - due to a work related accident that caused chemical burns and scarring of my bronchial tubes.  I have been prescribed mostly all the meds listed in other reviews. Including prednisone_ inhalers_ and Tessalon Perle.  Tussionex is the ONLY medicine that has worked for me.  Since I now have a chronic cough that will last a lifetime_ Tussionex has been a godsend. However_ I take it ONCE daily before bedtime or else I'm suffering with coughs and asthma-like attacks.  It stops my cough right in it's tracks.  It cannot be abused or it can cause other side effects listed here by others.  It is NOT cheap!  $187.00 a bottle at my pharmacy.  It does make me drowsy_ that's why I only take it at bedtime.  It is good tasting also.  I have noticed that I awake throughout the night in a dream like state_ always running my fingers through my hair.  ODD!!!  Because this works on the cough receptors in the brain_ I think these movements might have something to do with that.  I have to pick my battles_ it's either suffer with slightly wierd movements and dreams_ or asthma attacks that leave me breathless while I'm sleeping.  I choose Tussionex.  It's definately helped improve my quality of life!,F,44,3  years 1X D,8/13/2011Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
28, 5, chronic bronchitis,Can make me sleepy so I only use it at night.,I have had chronic coughs for years and I agree with many of the others - this stuff works.

29, 5, Chronic cough for two weeks prior,While tussionex completely knocked down the cough. prostrate problems came up and had to stop,Like I said Tussionex was working great and had to stop due to prostrate problems.  Dr. wouldn't prescribe another hydrocodone medicine so gave me tessalon pearls. To my supprise after two days I am getting some relief.  I just hope the cough hasn't just run its course.  I'll have to wait till this comes up again_ which will probably be in February or next summer. Cudos for Tussionex though.,M,60,2  days1 tsp 2X D,7/15/2011,Tussionex pennkinetic
30, 5, Severe cough fr/allergies bronchits,vivid dreams,"Like others here_ I too have a severe cough associated with allergies_ asthma_ bronchitis_ which I go through like clockwork about once a year.  Tussionex is the only cough med so far that  helps me stop coughing and sleep through the night.  I am very aware of the dependency risk due to the fact that it does contain narcotic ingredients_ so I only take it at night.  Tried other OTC meds for a few days between refills_ they didn't work_ but I didn't find myself ""jonesing"" for Tussionex",F,46,14  days1 tsp 1X D,5/24/2011,Tussionex pennkinetic
31, 4, Horrible Dry Cough,"Well_ I had a horrible dry cough_ so the Dr. gave me a RX for Tussionex. Went to Subway for dinner after we left the pharmacy_ didn't want to wait any longer_ got a spoon_ looked at the bottle quick and took 2 heaping teaspoonfuls. About 20 minutes later I was out of my element! I was in bed for the night with and itchy head and face_ and like someone else said_ while I was sleeping_ I kept half waking up_ like jerking awake_ it was WEIRD!!!! So tonight I go to take another dose_ I'm home_ so I look at the bottle more closely.....it says: ""Take 1 teaspoonful every 12 hours. Maximum daily dose 2 teaspoonfuls."" Wow!! I took waaaaaaaay to much. After taking what I am suppose to take_ I don't feel those effects.

33, 4, Cough& lack of sleep,Well_ I took three swallows straight from the bottle. I had that blazed feeling but i slept great. No cough_ just a dry mouth. My head felt really heavy. I woke up feeling great but about 8:30 the next morning_ I started feeling blazed again. I hadn't taken anymore that morning.

35, 4, deep cough and congestion/wheezing,the positives outweigh the negatives but there are some noticable side effects.  I am a big man (physically) and have a fairly high tolerance_ so I take approx. 3-4 tspns per day instead of 2.  The side effects are itching of my skin_ dry mouth_ constipation_ sudden jerking as if falling asleep suddenly.lost concentration.,It tastes good and has a fairly bright outlook.,M,51,7  daysone tspn 2X D,1/4/2011Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
36, 5, Bronchitis and sinus infection,I take 1 Tsp every 12 hours and the side effects are a slight itching (not too bothersome),I have had sinus infections and bronchitis regularly since 2008.  I have taken Tussionex and it is the only cough medicine that works for me.  I have tried Cheratussin_ OTC meds_ etc. and they do not work. My bronchitis gets so bad that I cannot lay down flat to sleep at night and must sit up in my rocking chair to try to sleep_ fluid builds up so deeply in my bronchial tubes that the coughing is like seizing attacks... However_ when I take Tussionex_ I can lay down to sleep_ the sinus congestion clears up and my urge to have coughing attacks is gone!  I told my husband that this stuff is expensive_ but it's Gold in a bottle for me.  My doctor prescribed me some more last week due to a sinus infection_ fever and bronchitis_ along with an inhaler.  Doctor even wrote me a refill for my Tussionex_ which surprised me a bit_ but she knows how bad I can get.  I only use it at night or if I have to work at school during the day (I substitute teach) or if I am going to be around others and don't want to have embarrassing_ uncontrollable coughing fits in front of them (which happens).  Anyway_ I highly recommend this medicine. It's only one that works for me. Amazing results and amazing relief.,F,42,  2X D,12/28/2010Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

I am not only on the Narcotic Hydrocodone which is found in this RX. I am also on Dilaudid_ Phentanyl and OxyContin.So back to the side effects. I am pretty sure that it is a combination of all of these Narcotics that have basically made me the junkie that I am. I hope for all of you in the world whether you are a good or bad person that you never have to go through this. However_ the Tussionex does help with the Naso.

38, 5, Exhaustive cough associated w/URI,Drowsiness_ light headedness_ loss of balance_ uncoordinated.  Itchiness and ringing of ears if taken for longer than a week or if more than prescribed was taken (example_ taking 1 1/2 tsp instead of 1 tsp),I love Tussionex because it's the only cough syrup that's strong enough to keep my coughing at bay.  I have asthma and so when I get an upper respiratory infection (about once a year)_ I can sometimes get a cough that throws me into asthma attacks in the middle of the night. Tussionex is the only thing that keeps this from happening.  I could take it during the day if I wanted to but the side effects are just enough that it makes me uncomfortable to drive.  So I just take at night and deal with this cough during the day.  Overall_ great medication but USE WITH CAUTION.  If it does make you drowsy_ you may find after a week or more of use that you find it harder to get to sleep at night without it.  It is highly addictive so use EXACTLY as prescribed.  Also_ it can make you itchy all over (and you can't satisfy the itch) if you take a little too much so measure it.  And after a week or so you can find that there is a ringing in the ears.  After stopping_ it goes away. This medication is a godsend for people like me but you have to measure the risks and the rewards.  Overall_ it's worth it for me.,F,32,7  days30mg 1X D,11/14/2010,Tussionex pennkinetic
39, 5, Asthma,"It makes me a little light headed when I haven't taken it for a while_ but soon (after 2-3 doses) that no longer seems to be a problem.  Individuals react very differently to hydrocodone_ so many may feel more side effects or none at all.  some people even get ""wired"" instead of relaxed_ but most do not.",When my asthma is at it's worse_ usually early spring and all through the fall_ I use Tussionex as needed 1-2 times a day and have great results.  I seldom wake up at night coughing and though I may be a tad drowsy if I take it in the morning_ it is not too bad and really helps me stop coughing.  The Hydrocodone also helps relax me so I think this relaxes my inflamed airways and thus lessens my other asthma symptoms as well. Since people react differently to medicines and especially to hydrocodone_ this may not be for everyone_ but for me it is nearly a miracle drug.,M,53,5  years1 teaspoon 2X D,10/19/2010,Tussionex pennkinetic
40, 5, uncontrollable coughing,drowsiness,I swear by the stuff! Not a lot of Dr.s will prescribe the medication but when I have problems getting my coughing under control and trouble sleeping I do not hesitate to suggest it to either an emergency room doctor or any other that I happen to see including my primary care physician.  Do to severe asthma complications beginning when I was very young_ Tussionex was not first choice but when we found nothing else would work for me_ I began taking a small amount under my mothers constant supervision.  I swear by it now_ my family swears by it now.  Tussionex is very well known to cause dizziness and drowsiness_ however if you have uncontrollable coughing and an over the counter even less intense cough suppressant is not working_ you should probably be in bed sleeping anyhow.  I personally truly appreciated the way it allowed me to relax when I was sick_  I have been capable of getting well faster when hit with a cough since I have discovered Tussionex.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends!,F,23, 1 tsp 1X D,8/30/2010,Tussionex pennkinetic
41, 5, Uncontrolled Coughing since 2003,Side effects include slight insomnia if taken too late_ slight difficulty in remaining focused on specific tasks_ if taken and I have a drink with caffeine for some reason I get a huge energy boost - however_ when multi-tasking going back to completion of the specific task leaves many projects incomplete in the short-term.  Other side effect includes a slightly dry mouth and unusual sweating on only the right side of the face and neck_ lower left back and sometimes the back of the knees. When reading below ***NOTE ? The section only allows for 1500 characters and I was a bit over ? the following was omitted from the ending ?I am about 80lb overweight and my diaphragm causes pressure against the stomach.  Unfortunately I just can?t afford it right now as I would love to be off this ? I truly hope this helps anyone with my condition and may not know it.?,A suggestion for people w/ chronic cough_ have yourself checked for Acid Reflux or GERD.  In 2003 I began an uncontrolled cough. The short is this ? I?ve been to 7-doctors.  2-Pulmonologists (Lung)_ 2-ENTs (Ear Nose & Throat) 2-Gastrointestinal Specialist and my Primary Dr.  Tests included_ 2-MRIs_ 1-CT Scan_ multiple X-rays of the chest_ throat and sinus area_ tons of blood work_ a bronchoscopy and finally an endoscopy.  All these doctors told me the same thing ? good news was ?All the things we thought it could have been it isn?t_? bad news was_ ?we still don?t know why you are coughing.? After 4-years I was sent to USC Med Center. The head of Gastroenterology put two probes up my nose down into the esophagus for 24-hours to monitor stomach gases.  A person with bad acid reflux normally has bad heartburn.  These people have between 30 - 45 episodes of acid reflux a day.  I have over 80 episodes a day but without heartburn so it confused the specialists.  The difference is that my condition only lets a little gas_ not stomach acid out into the esophagus causing a slight irritation.  As the gas leaks it is then inhaled.  The lungs try to protect the soft tissue of the lungs with mucus. With that and the esophagus irritation I get a persistent cough.   Tussionex closes off the sphincter muscle between the esophagus and the stomach stopping the cough dead.  Solutions that will stop this cough include weight loss_ Lap-ban,M,52,7  years1 Teaspoon 3X D,8/24/2010Email,Tussionex pennkinetic

46, 5, chronic cough_ allergeis,profuse sweating_ tremour_ coma like sleep_ stomach upset_ nausea_ diziness_ hot flash_ blurred vision_ drowsiness_ chronic fatigue,It seems to trigger a detox symptoms in me.  I break out in sweats_ and hot flashes a few hours after taking it. Very disquieting feeling. But it does perform like no other. I hate having to depend on it to sleep and to stop the cough reflex.,F,37,90  days,1/31/2010Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
47, 4, bronchitis,Felt light headed. Was lying in bed sick when I took it.  Didn't get up for a couple of hours and when I did I noticed that I was pretty woozy.  I looked at the label and it said take a teaspoon.  I had taken a tablespoon of it.  Misread on my part.  Guess you really need to be careful about following directions.  This is very potent medication.  I didn't take much more than the prescribed amount and it really made me feel light headed and spacey.  From the posts I'm reading about it on this site it sounds like some of you are chugging this stuff.  I would seriously not recommend that.  This medication is NOT something to play with.  I'm 220 lbs and just an additional teaspoon had me feeling like I could fall over.  I think there should be some stronger wording on the label about this medicine.  Don't be fooled just because it's cough syrup.  This is a narcotic and it will seriously mess up your day.,,M,39,1  days,1/12/2010Email,Tussionex pennkinetic
48, 2, Night Cough due to Cold,Dizziness_ severe headache and itching.  Helped me to sleep after 2 hrs of taking 1 teaspoon but woke up with headache_ chills and achy body.  Only had these symptons on the nights I took the Tussionex.  I would  not recommend this_ try an over the counter first.  The codeine in the tussionex give me a very bad reaction.,,F,57,4  days,1/11/2010,Tussionex pennkinetic
49, 5, dry hacking cough,Itchiness_ drowsiness,After over the counter cough syrups_ tessalon perles_ and promethazine with codeine failed to control my cough_ my doctor prescribed Tussionex_ and it worked better than any of those to suppress my cough. My side effects were mild - the itchiness bothered me a little_ but the drowsiness was not so much that I was unable to be active during the day_ and the Tussionex did help me fall asleep at night_ especially because I was coughing less.,M,26,7  days,12/27/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
50, 3, cough/congestion,wacky dreams_ ears ringing_ nausea,my doctor told me to take a half teaspoon or a full one every 12 hours. i took a full one in the morning and felt good. felt kinda high and just lied in bed_ watching tv.took another teaspoon 12 hours later_ before bed_ and couldn't sleep. i had an awful ringing in my ears that only subsided when i moved my head to the right. i could barely sleep and when i did_ my dreams were really crazy. i felt nauseas the whole time_ too. my cough was gone but the side effects were awful.,F,27,1  days,12/20/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
51, 5, hoarse cough_ sinus infection,itching_ feeling like nothing bothers me and i can accomplish anything.  hard to poop sometimes.,first of all_ this stuff is NOT THAT EXPENSIVE lol.  its $15 for a bottle.  if you want expensive_ when i was on adderall for a.d.d. it cost me $68 for a months supply.... that my friends_ is an example of expensive.  tussionex is amazing because it kicks the cough and releaves all my pain and soreness and runny nose and lets me sleep after giving me hours of energy where i accomplish many tasks.  this stuff makes life seem very interesting and also releaves my symptoms of anxiety and depression.,M,24,5  days,12/4/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
52, 4, Bronchitis,No real side effects other than relief initially.  The stuff really works.  I accidentally took a little more than a tsp on the 3rd day and experienced an unfortunate narcotic high.  I was spaced out and itchy.  It wasn't fun.,Measure carefully.,F,37,4  days,11/2/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic

54, 5, Severe cough,Mild drowsiness that last appx 12 hours.,This is the only cough medicine that has ever worked for me. i first tried it after it was prescribed for my mother (lung cancer)Absolutely amazing medication. And as to the expense. I wait until my deductible is fulfilled for the year then I had my doctor write me a prescription for the full size dispensing bottle. 443ml_ and no charge! One bottle has lasted me four years. I only use it when absolutely necessary.,M,56, ,10/17/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
55, 5, Flu,Extreme euphoria_ no pain,I slept like a baby for six hours_ then when I woke up I forgot that it was a 12 hour medicine and took it again. Was wired for the rest of the night. Made me feel well enough to go for a run. DON'T TAKE THIS AND DRIVE!!!,M,17,1  days,10/14/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
56, 5, chronic bronchitis,sleepiness,As others have stated_ this works when everything else fails. I've suffered through many bouts of bronchitis_ and it's a miserable experience. Tussionex is seriously the only thing that gets me through the pain and sleeplessness. I've not had any of the whacked side effects others have mentioned here_ but everyone is different and perhaps they just needed cut the dosage way_ way down.I just went to my doctor's office yesterday for yet another round of bronchitis_ and a new doctor sent me home with a 'lesser' cough syrup prescription. It was completely worthless and as a result I was up for hours_ and everything is now more painful. So_ yeah_ thanks for that_ doc. Needless to say I called back this morning for Tussionex and told them to stick with what WORKS. For doctors who are so 'afraid' of this stuff_ maybe they have personal issues that interfere with their judgment regarding others. Maybe they've never had chronic bronchitis or pneumonia and don't understand just how worthless the other cough remedies are. Whatever. It's ridiculous to expect someone else to suffer through when there is a solution.Someone mentioned earlier that they wish it came in generic form. YES_ it does. My pharmacy gives me the generic all the time.,F,46,8  years,10/9/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
57, 5, Cough_ sneezing_ congestion,dizziness,I have had a very bad cold for 5 days_ and have taken several OTC remedies_ as well as prescription Clarinex and Singulair.  Nothing worked until I took one teaspoon of Tussionex!  Within half an hour I stopped sniffling_ sneezing and coughing.  I would not be able to function at work_ but this is absolutely perfect for me when I can stay home and rest.,F,51,1  days,9/11/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
58, 5, Mycoplasma/Strep Throat/Bronchitis,Euphoria_ slight drowsiness_ relaxation,Whenever I get sick_ my doctor gives me this treasure. Not only is the medication completely effective against cough_ throat irritation_ and restlessness_ it gets you high to boot! I wouldn't call myself a drug addict_ but when everything is a blur_ I want something to mess me up. Tussionex is literally liquid gold.,M,20,10  days,7/31/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
59, 5, severe cough,drowsiness,I was forewarned about tussionex_ so I've always limited use to a half-dose as a last resort.  As has been mentioned_ it instantly smothers throat irritation_ tastes great_ and knocks you on your keister.  I can't imagine taking this stuff on a regular basis_ but boy am I glad it's there when I need it!,F,30,5  years,7/2/2009,Tussionex pennkinetic
