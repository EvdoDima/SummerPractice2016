0, 4, Cancer_ loss of limb due to cancer,Good pain relief. I've been on many different pain killers due to 39 surgeries so I know pain pills. Good energy for me_ no opioid constipation_ however it's the one pain med that I can crave and get addicted to so my Dr and I switch up the pain meds when I feel I'm having trouble getting relief or that I'm craving it. As soon as I feel like I'm desiring it and not just for pain_ I change medications. I've unfortunately been on some kind of pain med for decades and I've tried everything alternative to drugs as well. Oxy works but you better know your body and not get addicted to it. I'm always in pain_ 24/7 but Oxy does help a lot.,Just be careful with this drug. It's a wonderful drug_ yet it can kill you too. -,M,54,5  years60 MG,7/18/2016,Oxycontin

3, 4, broken leg resulting in amputation,Constipation_ itchy skin_ tooth decay_ weight gain_ constantly tired sleep up to 2hrs per day_ hot flushes_ increased eczema_ swollen leg & cellulitis_ but no pain BONUS!!,I was prescribed oxycontin & oxynorm for breakthrough pain relief after falling & shattering my ankle resulting in an external fixator & finally amputation_ by the hospital pain clinic. I was unlucky enough to get compartment syndrome in my foot which caused horrific pain so was given oxycontin as morphine didn't work. I've now been taking oxycontin for over 10yrs_ remarkably without realising the amount of side effects I've been living with until filling in this review_ which has somewhat alarmed me. I will be contacting my doctor for a referral back to the pain clinic to seek other alternative treatments to manage my pain. In the last 6mths I've started to suffer more & more with phantom pain & sensation so need help with this also. Oxycontin has controlled my pain for the last 10yrs but sadly also my life to a degree_ this I need to change.,F,44,10  years40mg 2X D,1/12/2016,Oxycontin

11, 5, Cosmetic Procedure,It is not intended as a maintenance medication for long term use. It is fine for a short stint of pain management_ i.e._ after a surgical intervention. Certainly if used conservatively it is a great help. Yes_ there are side effects_ for example pruritis (itching)_ dehydration_ constipation but if you stay well hydrated all will be well.,It is not perfect but it does work and is helpful in the immediate post operative period. It seems that there are more issues associated with long term use. I used it briefly to make the transition after the surgical intervention and then wean to ibuprofen.,F,60,1  days 1X D,3/25/2015,Oxycontin

This is NOT the same experience I had with oxycodone_ the short acting version.,"Unlike the short acting version_ I feel no ""high""_ am completely lucid and able to function. This drug has allowed me to live a more normal life; without it I would be in daily agony and likely wheelchair bound. Many people confuse short acting oxycodone (fine for short term but has more side effects_ including a feeling of need to increase dosage) with oxycontin. I have no need to increase the dose for years on end. (Initial increases were adjustments to get my level right). It is terribly expensive and almost impossible for disabled Medicare patients to afford once the hit the ""donut hole"".

I'm a runner_ which probably hurt my back even more running with a herniated disc but that's how determined of a person I am. These pills are impossible not to become dependant upon. Your body physically starts to need it to function! I only recommend this drug to hospice pts who are going to die while still on it. I am 4 days clean and it's been hell!!! Cold chills_ sweaty_ severe depression_ extreme fatigue!!! I'd choose the back pain if I could go back in time! I chose to stop taking it due to successful back surgery one month ago.

I have always had extremely high tolerance to pain meds and never had any reaction to taking cocaine.  I haven't had any side effects at all and it works on the pain great.  someone made a comment that they were tired of having to be the doctor and do all the investigating of everything and I totally understand because American doctors do not care at all anymore whether they can help a patient anymore.  I had a classic case of sleep apnea for over 10 years and not a single doctor ordered a sleep test until I demanded it and found I have a severe case probably due to my throat being damaged from a tube being in my neck for 8 hours surgery.

Yes it may give some people side effects like any other med but the side effects way out the benefit in my case personally. You should not have alot of these side effects if taken porperly_ eg: you only get the sweats when your with out the drug for long periods of time but if you have it when your supposed to that will not happen. The problem is people take more than they should and end up feeling like crap cause they ran out of it.

They are horrible. It is the WORST feeling you will ever go through. I WOULD RATHER GIVE BIRTH 20X A WEEK THEN HAVE WITHDRAWALS. I've withdrawaled longer than a week. You get restless muscles you want to crawl out of your skin_ anorexia_ you get goosebumps_ diarea_ vommiting_ hot and cold flashes_ just feel like you have a flu. I would tell anybody if they have arthritis or fibro use anti inflamatorys. DO NOT USE NARCOTICS. YOU ARE IN FOR HELL IF YOU DO. I had to go to a suboxone clinic_ and wean myself off.

OxyContin did not work well for the pain either.  I was given 30mg three times a day.  Eventually my body would go through withdrawal inbetween doses.  It was awful.  Then the makers of OxyContin changed the formula and within 3-5 months of the formula change this drug had given me a bleeding ulcer.  The new formula did give me better pain control.  I was switched to MS Contin_ which is we much better drug for chronic pain control.  I no longer go through withdrawal even if I fall asleep early and miss a dose.

I see a lot of people who have commented are addicted severely to this medication and seeing their dosage can see why_ they are far too high! My doctors carefully monitor my dosage and have stated that the dosage MUST be kept as low as possible as this is not a drug to be messed around with_ as my condition gets worse they want to be able to treat it_ if the dosage is too high to start with you end up taking enormous amounts which will only worsen the side effects. So think carefully of the dosage you take when starting this drug_ keep it as low as possible so that you do not end up taking it just to get through the day!,F,49,4  years2X10mg_ 2X D,11/6/2011,Oxycontin

Yes_ it does help with the pain....but it is highly addictive.  I had to put my daily pills in a cup with the time I was supposed to take them. I had to take them every 8 hours or began immediate withdrawal symptoms. It was horrible.  I even woke up in the middle of the night to take a dose.  You didn't dare go beyond your dose time. As time went on_ I felt suicidal as it got closer to dose time. I mean it was awful. I've never had depression or any suicidal thoughts until I took this pill. Pain was gone but so many other things went wrong mentally and physically. I decided to get off the drug and had to go into rehab for 7 days to get off of it.  It was HELL.

64, 4, failed back surgery syndrome; pain,constipation; memory loss,I originally started taking 2x per day but experienced withdrawal while taking & was really sick. Increased to 3x a day and was fine as far as handling the pain. I'm starting to go through withdrawal again and I don't want to increase my dose. I want to get off of this drug! & the memory loss is ridiculous. I can hardly remember anything anymore.

65, 3, chronic pain syndrome,Constipation_ nausea_ vomiting_ withdrawal symptoms,Oxy did help with pain but the side effects were too much for me.  After about a year_ I'd start going into withdrawal 8-10 hours after taking the drug.  Dr. would not increase dosage to 3/day_ so I decided to detox on my own.  At first cut the tablets in half and would wait until I absolutely had to take another one.  Once my body was comfortable with that_ cut pill into quarters.  After a week of 1/4 dose_ I was able to discontinue use.  It wasn't easy but it was a HECK of a lot easier than when I'd run out of pills and started the whole hellish withdrawal experience.  I know that the pills are not supposed to be cut_ but that worked for me.,F,54,2  years40 2X D,5/30/2011Email,Oxycontin
66, 3, pain management,Effectiveness was short term._ quick developing physical and physcological depenancy,Initally this was absolutely great. Within one month's time I had to move to 3x per day then a week later add one more dosage. At that point we decided to go another route as this was a dangerous dead-end. I would reccomend this for short-term pain management ONLY. If you have never gone through withdrawls count your blessings. You will wish you were dead_ NO FUN. Fortunately there are other options_ don't give up. It took almost 4 years working with my Dr to get a plan that works for me. And most importantly get a Dr you trust and can tell anything to. Its hard but if you have a good Dr they will have compassion for your situation and be willing to work with you.  Good luck!!,M,50,6  months60 2X D,5/30/2011Email,Oxycontin
67, 5, nerve damage-3 operations,I get drowsy throughout the day_ headaches_memory loss_constipation_sugar craving_ hot & cold flashes_low sex drive_the last few years I have had a hard time getting an erection.Withdraw pain is severe after 4-5 years & gets only worse over time.,My pain was so severe my Doctor wanted me to take Percodan but I said no way because they are very addictive_ so he said this new drug Oxycontin is not. Wow was he wrong! Yes the drug is great for my pain_ nothing else would work because of my nerve damage and you all know how bad nerve pain is_ but I have been on this drug for 12 years and I take 2 80 MG pills 2-3 times a day because over the years they don't last 12 hours but 8. Yes I want to get off of them because I can't work anymore but the goverment does not consider it a disability so only my wife brings in any money.But my wife tells me every time I try the pain is just too great. When I say pain_ I mean not just my nerve pain but withdraw pain seems even worse. Every nerve end in my body burns and it feels like all my bones are broken_ I have never in my life felt anything like it.I need something for my severe pain but I wish there was something other than a narcotic! I know I will probably be on this for the rest of my life and that's a scary thought_ I'm lucky to have my wife_ who has helped and understood the side effects. It's also too bad that so many people take this when they don't need it because it hurts the rest of us who really need it. So I'm torn with this drug_ yes it really helps my pain_ but the side effects are bad and the withdraw is even worse. For you people who have only used it for a year or less_ please stop taking it_ if you think you have problems now I tell you they will get way worse.,M,53,12  years160 MG 2X D,4/27/2011Email,Oxycontin

I also have Durogesic 50 (50mcg per hour transdermal patch) which lasts 75 hours at a time.  Unfortunately we found out I am one of those people who have a genetic issue with painkillers and anaesthetics wearing off too quickly_ and these OxyContin only last me 6-8 hours maximum_ hence why I take it more often than normal (I have come down from 30mg per dose).  I am only 26 years old and experienced domestic violence while I was pregnant with my youngest child.  Even now I am still not functioning like a ""normal"" person due to the chronic pain.  I hate being on all these pills_ and I know that I will be able to one day get off them_ because not only did I wean myself on IM injections 2 x per day of morphine by myself_ I have also weaned down from 30mg per day to 15mg (only recently) of the OxyContin.  I am not a 'take a pill to fix everyhing' kind of person_ so taking this cocktail everyday is not good_ but without it I am unable to walk or even sit.

Old version worked just fine for roughly 10+ years! It is clear from the firestorm online that many people are having problems with their OxyContin medication. Either Purdue screwed up the formula so some of us who are chronically ill can't utilize it_ or perhaps the shipments are being hijacked. Either way_ there needs to be an investigation! Increasing a dose to double or more_ one option mentioned to me_ could be incredibly dangerous_ as we don't know why it isn't working. Should the dose be increased and a change occur that allowed a patient to then utilize it as before_ it would cause an overdose & perhaps be fatal.

This change was made without notification to myself or my doctors & with inadequate notice to my pharmacist AND without ""Informed Consent"" my medication_ and that of others legitimately on it. The actions taken by my doctors_ surgeon_ anesthesiologist & an ER doctor as a direct result could have been deadly_ as they had no idea this change had occurred. I have to also wonder if this falls under ""The Federal Anti-Tampering Act"" that makes tampering with consumer products a felony punishable by up to 10 years in jail?

99, 5, Fibromyalgia,None_ Oxycontin along with Norco and Soma is the best combination I have found to control my SEVERE Fibromyalgia so that I can function and be a wife and Mommy.,This is a FANTASTIC medication_ I take it along with Norco_ it enables me to function and be a wife and Mommy. Without it I would be totally crazy from the pain_ curled up in a ball crying.  It is SO unfair that people who abuse drugs and don't take them correctly give drugs a bad name. Oxycontin is a gift to all of us who are responsible with it and use to be able to have a life. I am thankful everyday that I have a good doctor_ and have these drugs that enable me to have a life. Listen to your doctor and use them the way they are perscribed_ and oxycontin can be a wonderdrug for Fibromyalgia and other pain disorders. If you are responsible I HIGHLY reccomend it!

100, 3, FM/CFD/fibromyositis/dystonia,Hallucinations_ night sweats_ weight loss_ euphoria_ & nightmares.,I've taken oxycontin for sometime now. I've tried several other narcotic pain relievers and this has worked the best.  I had a real problem getting the generic... especially as a young black male. I later learned that the generic is no longer available.  To that end_ be sure your doctor writes the script for the brand name or else you will NOT get the script filled.  Also_ be certain to go to the same pharmacy monthly to improve your chances of them having it in stock. Withdrawal usually lasts 4-5 days and can be brutal.  And to all those who use this pain reliever for recreational purposes_ remember there are persons who NEED the aforementioned to help improve their quality of life!

Finally after several months I agreed that my Dr put me on this medication.The Dr that originally prescribed this medication told me I wouldnt become addicted if & took as prescribed_ LIE LIE!!! Over the years I have gone from 10 mg twice daily to 80 mg twice daily. Now after all these years a different Dr wants to take me off it. I am being tapered off at 2 week intervals by 20 mg at a time. I get night sweats_& wake up at night with withdrawls & cant wait until 8 am so I can get my 60 mg to make the symptoms cease.

104, 4, Severe disk degeneration_ neuralgia,Horrible constipation_ itching_ nauseau_ feeling 'out of it.' Dry mouth_ stomach cramps and bloating.,I had a car accident a year ago that damaged my spine.  I was in debilitating pain that made it impossible for me to drive or work.  Oxycontin made it possible for me to live my life.  BUT.  It is VERY_ VERY ADDICTING.  I never felt 'high' on it_ except maybe once or twice and it was not an enjoyable feeling.  I'm currently weaning off it.  At my highest usage I was taking 2 40 mg oxycontin a day_ plus up to 8 7.5 mg vicoprofen for breakthrough pain.  I'm now down to 20 mgs oxycontin ONCE a day and 2 7.5mg Vicoprofen at night.  Withdrawals are not easy.  I have leg cramps_ restless sleep_ pain (which i know is not real_ but in my head)_ sneezing_ and depression.  But I'm a tough person and I WILL get off this medicine.  I want to correct a few misconceptions people have written here (I am a pharmacist.) With a few very rare exceptions_ people do not die from opiate withdrawal.  Those who experience severe and life threatening symptoms often have co-morbidities (ie other problems_ such as advanced heart disease_ high blood pressure_ etc.)  It is very important to never take more than your prescribed does and to ask your doctor to taper you off gradually.  In about 5 days I will be off the 20 mg oxycontin althogether and will switch to short acting vicoprofen.  One way to slowly taper yourself is to use sandpaper to smooth away a tiny bit of the pill every day (this should only be done with the short-acting pills; if you mess with the oxycontin_ it destroys the time release eff,F,48,1  years40 mg 2X D,4/19/2010,Oxycontin
105, 5, spinal cord injury,I have had no obvious side effects_ (that I know of)Know one says I am crazy_ not jumping of bridges_ streaking thru central park_ & rarely am I ill.,Since starting out on oxycontin in 1995_ I was able to returned to work. I always had & have to be careful to not become caulky & do more than I should to cause further injury_ but oxycontin did give me my life back. I had been on about every kind of pain killer there was in the market before oxycontin & each would do well for a short limited time. The nice thing about oxycontin is I can have a normal day_ no highs or lows or periods of confusion as with other pain drugs. I take 4 40 mgs per day & 4 oxycodone 5mgs per day. The cost for me to move up to the 80 mgs oxycontin daily is way to high to consider not having any medical insurance & being self pay. So having the 5's does help me make it thru the day. I also should note_ I have a great deal of respect for oxycontin & my doctor and what both have offered me since 1995. With this said I have never mis-used my meds & never will. Pre 1995 I barely worked more than 10 days per month & did so with a great deal of pain. In addition I would spend a great deal of time walking with a cane or bedridden due to the pain. I sincerely was becoming sick of having to live as I was. My career is in residential construction.

106, 5, FMS_ Periph-Neuropathy_ Chron Pain_,Initially I was more tired than normal. Fatigue is part of Fibro and after a week the additional fatigue subsided. I started at 2/day_ then to 3/day due to having to still use more BT meds (Percocet 10/325). Have some constipation just as any other opioid. It took a while to get to a GOOD dosage that was consistent. I can actually function to an extent when on this medication; recently had to be switched to Kadian due to Medicaid being approved_ they said I have to try Kadian (Morphine ER) for 90 days. Kadian/Morphine is AWFUL. While it works once it kicks in_ it does not last 12 hours and end up using BT meds. With Oxycodone ER_ it lasted about 10-11 hours before it would start wearing off and did not need as much BT meds.,Fully recommend if you need CONSISTENT relief.

124, 1, Amputation_ Broken Bones_ Trauma,sweating_ over eating_ insomnia_ blackouts_ always tired_ itching and picking from skin crawling_ irritable_ constipation_,I was 22 when I started taking oxycontin and oxycodone.  This was due to a work accident involving a rail car_ and being ran over and drug down the tracks across asphalt.  This resulted in an amputated left leg_ broken bones_ severe road rash from neck to feet and severe nerve damage from being twisted into a pretzel under the rail car.  I though that was the worst thing that could of happen_ but when the pain doctors went to send me home after two weeks_ they put me on oxycontin and oxycodone.  Due to such a high tolerance the doctors had me taking 1200 mg of these meds a day.  I have spent nearly ten years on it_ trying to wean off of it but the withdrawls were to much.  This med has robbed me_ my wife_ and my kids of a life we all deserve.  I never thought life was a problem while on it_ other than when I was running out of meds.

I am now 2 weeks out of rehab_ and 5 weeks without use and my life has been better those five weeks than it's been in years.  I saw so many in rehab from this nightmare of a drug.  I know there are people who need it_ but I think there are too many that are prescribed it and then cut off and many of these people must use other drugs to try to get the same effect.

My doctor has also be great in allowing me to find the best combination the treats my pain. Generics are not as effective as brand i have found.

The NSAIDS I was prescribed initially after fracturing my spine caused 3 ulcers and were mostly ineffective.  Vicodin was of limited use because the effective dose for treating my pain was damaging my liver because of the Tylenol it contains.

She had sudden and profound memory loss_ confusion_ didn't make sense when she spoke_ became a very scary driver_ going the wrong way down a street for awhile -- disorientation.,"While Oxycontin has been described as just a stronger version of Vicodin_ without the acetaminophen_ it seems to be different in some other way.  My mother took Vicodin.  OVer 10 years or so_ she went from 500 mg. pills to 750 mg. piils_ and increasing the number of pills taken over the years from 1 or 2 to 4 or 5 a day.  Besides developing a tolerance and needing to increase the dose_ the only other problem she had was constipation.  No itching_ memory loss_ etc.  It was my concern about her taking so much acetaminophen_ along with another non-liver-freindly statin drug_ that caused her doctor to switch her to smaller doses of Oxycontin.  That's when her memory disappeared and my boyfriend kept singing ""and then she got high""!  She definitely cannot_ and doesn't want to_ take Oxycontin anymore!  Luckily_ a lot of what she'd thought was back pain turned out to be a hip problem_ so after hip replacement surgery_ she's taking twice daily doses of extra strength Tylenol_ and NO opiate pain relievers.

Feeling like everything is okay and your problems are not that big a deal.,I took the oral dose like you are supposed to. Everyone else I know that takes these for pain snorts them. I guess the risk of death is not important to them. Anyway it alleviated my pain just fine_ but I had very little euphoria like everyone talks about_ which is good. I don't want any addiction issues. Since my pain is a temporary post-operative thing_ I doubt this will happen anyway. I could not believe I did not get nauseated or vomit_ and this has happened on Vicodin. I seriously felt like Oxycodone was weaker than the Vicodin_ but that could be because it is time released. I could see how they could be addictive if you took a higher dose (mine is 20 mg) or you snorted or chewed off the time release which every idiot who takes these to get high does. Then they wonder why they have to go to rehab or take methadone.,F,35,7  days,1/12/2009,Oxycontin
140, 5, Pain from thoracic surgery,Vivid nightmares + waking dreams_ sweating_ itching_ severe constipation_ difficulty urinating_ constricted pupils_ nervousness_ intense euphoria_ dependency,Was originally prescribed for post-surgical pain management. When I ran out_ I was not only still in pain (and have been suffering from chronic pain for the past two years since the surgery)_ I was getting withdrawal symptoms! They told me this wouldn't happen if I only used the medicine for pain; they were wrong. Because I'm bipolar (schizoaffective?)_ for some reason withdrawal from oxycodone triggers psychosis_ so I *can't safely quit* unless I want to pose a danger to myself and others. I found a friend who can get me oxycodone from pain patients who sell their extras to her so they can afford the ridiculous cost of this medicine. This street oxy costs $.50/mg_ and I usually buy about 5 80 mg pills and crush them up and snort - total of 60 mg a day_ just so I don't have psychotic episodes from w/d. My tolerance hasn't gone up at all in the two years I've been on it -- but spending $2-300 a week on oxycodone is painful enough despite my body being used to it and there being few side,M,19,2  years,12/22/2008Email,Oxycontin
141, 4, 6 Shoulder Surgeries,Itching_ Hypoglycemia_ You must eat before taking this medication! Sleepiness,I have had six labral reconstructions_ (3) on each shoulder since May_ 2007. I am about to have number (7) my left shoulder on 12/10/08. I was on percocet 5/325 (1 every four hours) and then Vicodin 7.5/750 (1 every four to six hours). I was scheduled for my 7th surgery to be done on 11/12/08 but my liver enzymes were slightly elevated because of all the Tylenol in the Vicodin. My doctor switched me to Oxycontin (20mg a day) and my enzymes have started to go down. I get decent pain relief with the one dose but it doesn't last 8 to 12 hours like it is supposed to. This may be because I have developed a tolerance to oxycodone from being on Percocet for so long. I will not increase my dose on my own. I will talk with my doctor first. I also have herniations L4-L5-S1 that give me back pain_ but sweat it out. If you abuse this medication you can end up in the ER or just stop breathing. How some people take up to 80mg or more of this drug a day just for kicks and don't die amazes me.,M,43,30  days,11/29/2008,Oxycontin

Then a year after taking them i had a little girl_ she was born in Jan and i was at the methadone clinic Feb. It took two years on methadone then i was done.

I was taken by ambulance 5 weeks after starting this medication - suspected heart attack which turned out to be as a result from oxycontin ruining my stomach.  I was unable to eat very much for over 4 months - warm food and drinks were out.  Huge weight loss resulted.  I ceased taking oxycontin on my own volition 5 weeks into the treatment - but it was 3 months before my stomach healed and any appetite returned.

227, 5, chronic pain,tired_ constipation,I read all of your comments with extreme frustration.  The people that are taking this med for the righ reasons gave it a 3-5.  The people who abuse it have negative things to say.  This is supposed to be a rating for patients on the med.  After reading some of your posts_ I would be scared to death to take this med.  I can say it saved my life.  I went from crawling on the ground to walking.  I also have dropped dosages and increased dosages with little problems_ under doctor supervision.  I have never wanted to abuse the drug.  I never run out of my script early.  I don't feel the need to have more.  I need this drug.  I am frustrated with the people who continue to abuse it.  They need to realize what they are doing to chronic pain_ they are ruining it for us.  Please_ if you are in chronic pain do the research_ don't listen to the people on a site.  Ask your doctors_ nurses_ other chronic pain patients.  You have pain rights_ you need to feel as if your pain is being helped.  For m,F,40,2  years,3/20/2007,Oxycontin

I am very willing to deal with any side effect from this drug it has saved my life.,I am not a believer in medical science anymore. When I first got diagnosed w/SLE I was not on any meds never even had a drink of alchol i was 21yo. I went into the hospital w/chest pain and found out that my pericardium was filling up with fluid. They treated the pericarditis and tested me for Lupus and it came out possitive. I then came down with vasculitis about 1 month later and was having gran maul seizures so the put me in the hospital and started chemotherapy (Cytoxin)and put me on Oxycontin 20mgs. every 12 hours this was not enough so the doc's then decided to keep me in the hospital and give me IV demerol 100mgs. every other hour this made me a zombie. I was in the hospital and on this dose for 6 weeks. When they got me off the demerol they put back on the Oxycontin 20mgs 3x a day. After my doses of chemo for 6 mos. I was getting very numb in my face and limbs and my right side was very week.

I can't believe how many people are so ignorant of pain management_ even new pharmacists.  I've gone off of it 5 times with very few problems with withdrawals when I had an epidural steroid injection that actually worked.  If you are having a hard time stopping the medication_ you are probably stopping it too fast.  I recommend abstaining for as long as you can stand it (say 12-24 hours)_ then taking about half the previous day's dose.  I abstain for another 12-24 hours then take half the previous dose again.  Once I settle down to 20-30mg then I have to slow down on the taper.  Just make sure you have some Immodium for the runs.  Also_ it is quite helpful to have some muscle relaxers like Flexeril and a benzodiazapine for the anxiety.  I've been able to stop from up to 240mg per day in abo,M,37,3  years,3/14/2007,Oxycontin

234, 5, Krohns disease,"First of all_ for the  people that dont need this drug and are abusing it for personal use_ a lot of u like to call them selfish and scumbags_ Im pretty sure when their taking it_ it never occurrs to them that they are ruining it for the rest of the people that really need it.  I totally agree that those abusers_ inluding me are ruining it for the ones that need it.  But what do u expect when theres a bigger drug problem than you'd ever expect going on in this country_ when they hear that Oxycontin is the best pain medicine for severe pain_ that when crushed and snorted will have a strong ""heroin"" like affect. Obviously if they can get their hands on it_ they will_ or at least experiment it.  But the problem is_ unlike a lot of other drugs_ this is probably one of the most addicting out there_ of all kind.  I dont think the Gov is doing enough to help addicts come off_ Jailtime just makes things worse_ and methodone clinics aren't much of a difference_ cuz now your relying on",I do feel bad that patients that do need this medicine badly are given a hard time to get it. It gives such a great feeling_ and it is so easy to get_ for me at least_ that it gives the abusers an easy opportunity to at least try it.  I wish it wasn't so easy to get_ because it is so addicting_ yet I wish that everyone who truely needs it can get it.  Its a big Catch 22_ the drug works so good_ that it works wonders for the terminally ill and other patients_ but because it works so good_ the non-sick will want it as well_ and because it is so extremely addicting_ there will always be a high demand for it.  I dont have an answer for it.  Punishing the addict with jail time honestly does absolutley nothing.  If they could find a way for it to be just as potent_ but without the severe withdrawal affects than that may work.  Otherwise you may be surprised to discover that its not really high-school kids abusing this_ a lot of it is the working class_ 20-40 year olds_ who want to stop but c,M,23,1.5  years,2/22/2007,Oxycontin

On a positive note_ u can last very long in sex on this.,I've never actually swallowed an OC_ only sniffed them. I'm  Snorting anywhere from 80mg-320mg a day_(there's been days when I've done 640mg unfortunately.  It started slow_ almost 2 years ago when it was a once a weekend thing_ maybe 40mg. But now for about the past 6 months I've had a severe addiction where I'd sniff at least 240mg a day up to 400mg on average_ with rare periods of 1600mg =(20->80mg pills) in a 3 day span.  No lie. My tolerance just grew everyday. So my withdrawals are likely worse than most. I just can't seem to stop for more than 3 days in a row. I never had a script_ it was just something that I started doing to make work fun and pass by_ then at some point I relied on it.  So watch out with this stuff_ some people need it_ but if not please don't get started. I don't think our Gov is doin enough for people with drug addictions.

267, 5, psoriatic arthritis_ RLS_ fatigue,At first it made me itchy_hot_ and very high. I took 1 40 mg a day. It also wears off in 8-12 hours depending on the food taken with and before. I switched to minimum of two 20 mg a day_ usually 3. I took antidepressants prior_ the combination made me crazy with a fast temper. Eliminating the antidepressants got rid of the most side effects - bad temper_ memory loss_ and general insanity. I used alcohol as my pain killer before_ when i stopped drinking beer (only beer no hard stuff) I got very constipated. I do not drink at all now and I eat lots dried fruit_ limit meat and other things to help with the constipation. I smoke marijuana because of chrontic nause prior_ the O.C. allowed me to become atctive and the nause went away. I reversed the cycle and now exercise and getting better and better. My memory is getting much better - at first it severally effected it. I am very intelligent and the loss memory was not acceptable. Once I got of all antidepressants my memory problems cleared,I like to say this drug saved me. Thank the lord! Amen. I just wanted to die for over a year_ in the last few years_ from all my problems. Besides the arthritis pain_ the nerve pain_ I also feel like I have the flu everyday for last 7 years. I have a very high pain threshold but after so long I just could not take it any longer - NOW I AM ALMOST PAIN FREE AND USING HALF THE DOSE. Its very unfortunate that many  people here allowed themselves to abuse this medicine to point that they are very addicted. For me I have been able to cut back from 60 mg max to 20 to 40 mg a a day - i know average about about 25-33 mg per (that is_ one 20 mg a day and 2 every 3-4 days) day. Although I have taken this drug for over a year I hope to be completely off of it in the next 6 months. I have adjusted to 20 mg_ taken before bed so that I now am almost normal with no side effects other then constipation. I feel like I did before I got sick - that's a miracle!

That is I try not to take it until the pain is unbearable again. Although it takes longer to work when you wait I think that waiting is the key to controlling the additive power of this miracle drug. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you wait_ you need it_ you wait for that feeling that you are going to be in a lot of pain if you wait any longer.

Despite the side effects_ Oxy is an excellent medication when taken properly.  I have been disabled all my life and doctors have told me that narcotics taken in the absence of pain make you high; when taken for pain_ no such euphoria presents itself.  I guess this is why recreational users experience what they do. I recently was given a license to grow and use marihauna to complement my treatment and stay on a maintenance dosage.

Time for the FDA to get off the backs of sick people - all in the name of the children.  We deserve great care and are not getting it.,Read some others and the lady that is suggesting that everyone gets hooked on this sort of medication is flat out wrong - as you can see from others.

My choice would be to work with a doctor to find the best for me - without FDA interference and in NJ_ state interjection into doctor/patient relationship.  Some people get hooked on booze but because it provides huge revenues to governments that seems to be OK.  I for one don't want to have that even as a choice but I can see it happening if we don't let those folks know that we need care.  If teenagers want to do stupid things_ nothing is going to stop them other than proper education both at home and school.

It feels like my bones are throbbing (like someone is hitting them with a hammer) and I would get symptoms like having severe flu. I could not sleep because the pain was worse at night and that affected every other aspect of my life. I would soak in water as hot as I could stand it at 3 or 4am to try and get some relief while praying for sleep. Then I would get a bladder infection from sitting in water so often. Then I would take antibotics for the bladder infection and then get a yeast infection from the antibotics. This was a cycle I lived for more than 20 years. I saw countless doctors and had surgery on my knees. (one doctor said my knees were the problem) Finally I was really at my end when I was sent to a rheumatologist who diagnoised me and put me on oxycontin.

This is like when you try to go_ nothing comes out for a while and you get a squeezing_ stinging feel that feels like a bladder infection. (After that_ the urine *does* come out though_ heh.)  It also caused some drowsiness_ and some head-floating feeling.  Definitely gives you dry mouth_ too.  It was hours later that the stronger effect set in - strange anxiety_ sleep disturbance_ and a nightmare.,I took a low dose and it did eliminate 90% of the pain in about 30 minutes.  This was great_ but the side effects were troubling.  It made me drowsy_ but when I tried to sleep I was restless.  After the pain relief started to wear off (in roughly 4 hours)_ I felt jumpy and would have little adrenaline rushes (?) in my chest at every sound.  Strange and disturbing dream_ and when I woke I felt jittery and my heart seemed to be faster for a couple hours.  This anxiety lasted about 2-3 hours.

310, 3, trigem. neuralgia_ sev. back pain,lethargy_ weakness_ slowed thinking; constipation,I've had eight back operations. I had shingles last year in my face and have permanent neurological damage. My pain level was severe and constant. The base level of ALL pain (after fifteen years of back pain) was obliterated_ so it seemed as if the lethargy was worth it. Eight months later_ with a tolerance built up_ I do not feel it's worth it to up the dose and lethargy. I am a writer by trade and I need to think. I appreciated the respite_ but I'm prepared to readjust to the pain in order to feel my life as myself again.  No regrets; the medication was a Godsend. However_ getting OFF the stuff isn't a piece of cake.  Remember that.

314, 5, Chronic Back Pain 5 fusions L5-S1,Constipation and horrible withdrawals when RX was stolen and Dr. wouldn't refill,This medication is awesome and has given me my life back. I have been on some form of pain medication for the last 23 years.  Nothing worked as good as the Oxy.  I also take Oxycodone 5mg 4-8 tabs up to 4x per day for breakthrough pain.  Gonna talk to my Dr. about switching me to OxyfastIR for the breakthrough pain.  I recently fractured my Ankle and had to have pins put in.  They gave me Morphine IV in the ambulance and that hardly touched it.  In the ER they have me Dilaudid 4mg every 15 minutes after explaining to them the meds I was on.  This worked great and took away the pain while they were setting my ankle until surgery.  I was very lucky that the Doctor that did the surgery was aware that I would have a hard time managing my pain from the surgery due to the high level of meds I take.  I ended up taking 40mg of Oxycodone the first 3 days after I got home to take the edge off of the pain.  I receive my Meds from PurduePharma.  I am not working and could not afford the $900.00 per month for the 100 mg I take in the AM and PM.  I would suggest anyone that is attempting to pay for this medication to call Purdue and ask them for an application for their Patient Assistance Program.

During this period I was going through a hard time due to some things that were out of my control and the Oxy just made everything beautiful. I started really wasting my money on it and became kind of a scumbag_ stealing money from my mom.  I actually stole two bottles from my stepdad and got in the worst trouble of my life because of it. I wouldnt say I was addicted but I just loved how I felt on it and it really made me forget about my problems. Now that its over though I see how much ive changed and how much I really hate who I was back then.  My circumstances are getting better so I can do drugs recreationally and not worry about getting addicted. I realize moderation is the key to so many of peoples drug problems.  Stay away from this stuff if your depressed_ it may help temporarily but in the end itll destroy you. Plus this stuff is so expensive you start spending money you could use to improve your life on drugs that are just instant gratification and make your problems worse.

Take O.C.(or any pain killer) as prescribed.2.  Different drugs work differently for different people.

356, 5, rsd,Nausea for about a week_ headaches_ major withdrawl symptoms if dose is not taken on time. The ups and downs and highly addictive.,This does work very well for chronic pain. I have tried them all except the patches which is what I am going to have to go to now because my DR says this is causing my kidneys to not filter properly which is causing me to have edema in the feet ankles and legs_ a very hard time urinating_ blood in my urine and severe back pain.  The only problem is that I am on 160 mg every 8 hours and I am slowly tapering off but having very bad withdrawls_ It's like a time clock going off in my body when it's time to take it_ the chills start and I am just miserable.  Not sure how I am going to get through it but I just keep asking the lord to help me.  Despite all of that it does work well but is highly addictive and it doesn't take long.  SO BE CAREFULL!!  Should only be used for severe chronic pain.,F,33,2  days,7/2/2004,Oxycontin

Final withdraw was accompanied with 30 days of insomnia,This drug is being pushed by the pharmacuedical company under false information.  This is a very dangerous drug.  I know of over 10 addicts personally now.  Make sure you do research on this before you allow your doctor to put you on it.

365, 5, To get high,euphoria_ the world becomes a very warm soft mellow place.,I had a connect that knew where to get the 40's. I first tried it by cutting one in half and ate it. I blew chunks most of that night but still for some odd reason that didn't stop me from trying again. My tolerance went from just 1/2 a 40_ to within one month I was snorting 80mg a day and drinking 2 bottles of wine to add to the effects. I did this for about 5 months. At the same time I was smoking alot of marijuana and ciggarettes. I decided to go cold turkey from all four substances because I've quit smoking pot and ciggarettes and booze all at once before it wasn't that bad. Well within 12 hours I started to feel very odd. Within 24 hours I was rolling on the floor crying out to God to please take my life. This lasted for 4 days till I finally couldn't take anymore and copped 20mg of liquid methadone. That methadone not only saved my life_ or so it felt so_ but it got me over the hump enough that I was able to go back to work within two days. Moral of the story....don't use this drug to get high. It will destroy you very quickly and you will wish you were dead when going through withdrawal. Thank god I never got ahold of some needles to shoot the crap up. I'll also let you know it messed my suinuses up pretty bad. Took about a month till I could breath normal again. Only take this drug if you are in extreme pain. Peace and sobriety !,M,36,5  months,4/1/2004,Oxycontin

You began taking them in the first place.So do not go without them for 2 days at the most.Or your pain will double.You must get help immediately.Due to the serious dangers it can cause to your health.,Oxycontin is a very unique medicine.It has helped very ill individuals like myself.Although it is very widely abused throughout America.To where it has caused it to be hard on those whom need it.This pain medicine is one of the best painkillers on the market.Yet it is highly addictive when taken abusively or as recommended.If your pain is to unbearable to stand.Consider strongly about taking this medicine.I also highly recommend that you do this.Take it as prescribed by your physician.Do not fear all the talk you hear about it.Yes_it is an opiate!But thats because its the best painkillers ever created.By our American Chief Physicians and all the makers of pain control medicines.Also your Physician would not prescribe you a medicine.If he or she didn't think it was to benefit you_their patient_whom needs it...,F,44,3  years,12/4/2002Email,Oxycontin

Now that I have not raised my dosage for almost two years due to adequate pain control..I am severely  depressed and also physically addicted to this drug. I would advise against going on it unless it is for *short term use* only. There has not been enough research on the long-term side effets this drug may cause in the brain due to it being rather new. I wish I had never ever started down this path and only used it on a PRN basis. Instead I went to a daily dosage out of fear of the severe pain and as a preventative measure. It has destroyed my emotional well being.,,F,46,4  years,10/21/2002,Oxycontin
