0, 3, Whooping Cough,Disorientation_ extreme drowsiness_ vomiting.,Despite the vomiting_ this drug worked wonders for me. I went from coughing for ten hours straight with shortness of breath to actually getting a good night's sleep. Would use again.,F,30,1  days5mg 1X D,7/7/2016,Hycodan
1, 5, Upper respiratory & onset pneumonia,Sleepiness _ euphoria_ itchiness,I had a horrible infection in my lungs _ the coughing fits would leave me lightheaded or throwing up.  This is the only medication that helped.  Would not recommend taking more then prescribed dosage.  Can make side effects worse . Works good on short term basis.,F,25,4  days5ml,5/19/2016,Hycodan
2, 2, Whooping Cough,Extreme confusion_ nausea_ headache_ throbbing pain in stomach_ dizziness.,This medicine was very dangerous to me_ I had to wait 48 hrs for it to be completely leave my system but it wasnt for 72 hrs that the side effects went away. It felt like I was drunk and with an extreme hangover.,F,40,2  days30mgs,3/29/2016,Hycodan
3, 5, Uncontrollable cough,No side effects-stopped my cough immediately,I have had an uncontrollable cough for over a month. Had every test done to determine the cause_ but found nothing. I was driving anyone around me crazy with this cough.  This is the only cough syrup that stopped it. First night of sleep in a long time,F,62,6  days,3/11/2016,Hycodan
4, 2, Bronchitis,Chest tightness_ anxiety_ hard to breathe_ chills/shivering teeth chattering for several minutes_ nausea.,I have take other hydro cough syrups before and had no issues.  This one made me feel horrible_ I took a dose_ felt fine_ better_ then 4 hours later as directed took another does.  A couple hours later I woke up in middle of night in panic feeling terrible.  I wondered if it was just a panic attack which I have had a couple in my lifetime.  But after reading what I have here and talking to my doc I think it was a reaction to the Hycodan.  It worked great for cough but it was horrible was afraid I was having heart attack or something.,F,47,2  days10ml 1X AN,12/16/2015,Hycodan
5, 1, Awful cough,Nausea_ dysphoria_ panic attack_ inability to sleep_ rapid heart rate_ headache.,I have taken codeine cough syrup my entire life. However_ I will never take another drop of this. I believe the homatropine (that is now added to discourage abuse) made me very_ very ill. I took one teaspoon in the afternoon and vomited twice and had a terrible headache_ felt very anxious. At bedtime I took less than half a teaspoon to be conservative. Could not sleep at all_ mind very wired. Drifted off lightly_ then woke at two a.m. with pounding heart. Had the worst emotional feelings in a long time. Extreme dread and detachment. In my opinion_ they have ruined a really great medicine for me in order to prevent misuse and abuse. It's sad because it stops a cough dead in its tracks.,F,38,1  days1 teaspoon,6/2/2015,Hycodan
6, 5, Bronchitis,Drowsiness_ a little hallucinogenic but not bad more like I'm not sure if im sleeping or awake nothing crazy and all while in bed so no danger,It's the best cough syrup I've been ever given. Works quickly.,F,40,5  days5 mg 3X D,1/5/2015,Hycodan

13, 5, flu,i hadnt had a good nights rest in 2 nights and literally 15 minutes after taking this medication i was sleeping like a baby. it does wonders when you are miserable. me and my bottle were best friends for 6 days. and theres still half a bottle left!,,F,23,6  days1 to 2 teaspoons eve,2/20/2013,Hycodan
14, 5, Acute bronchitis and laryngitis,Instantly helped with the severe coughing at bedtime so I could rest_ but I do have itching all over my body from head to toe. The itching is tolerable considering it suppresses my coughing attacks. Love this stuff.,,F,36,3  days2 tsp q4h,1/19/2013,Hycodan

17, 5, chest cold / virus,I was given hycodan many years ago and have loved it ever since for my coughs due to colds / influenza. I cannot take OTC meds as they have decongestants in them which make me very agitated and anxious and the effect lasts for days. I can handle the dopey effects of hycodan. My big complaint - ITCHING! I don't itch with reg codein. So although I am not coughing I am up all night scratching! Take benadril to counter this effect - but only at night as you will get very drowsy.,If you are in Canada you can get 'Tylenol #1' (aceteminaphin with 8mg codein) OTC (ask the pharmacist) and this also works GREAT for coughs. Codien is a resperatory suppressant - that is why it calms your cough.,F,43,2  days5mg/5ml 2X D,10/2/2010,Hycodan
18, 2, severe cough_ asthma_ COPD,"I was prescribed a bottle containing 120 doses. I took my 1st does as directed which was last night. At first I felt euphoric and was able to breathe better. However... 30 mins. later I felt very dizzy so I went on to bed. Although I slept well_ when I woke in the middle of the night; I felt so ""intoxicated"" that I didn't want to get out of the bed. Upon waking this morning_ I had a horrible migraine_ VERY nauseated (I did vomit later) and so sluggish that I actually had to reschedule another doctor's appointment. It is now 11:17 AM and all I want to do is to go back to bed. I spent the past hour in the shower trying to get ride of a headache and to become more alert. To drive a vehicle is still not a good idea yet.",If you are Opiate sensitive: DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION.,F,44,1  days1-2 Tsp 1X D,7/8/2010Email,Hycodan
19, 5, URI's & allergy induced asthma,No noticeable side effects except RELIEF!,I wish this stuff came by the gallon it works that great.  When you can't sleep because all at once you are coughing so hard you pee your pants_ spitting up green goo & your chest tickles so bad you can't talk_ this magic elixir makes the world right again.  This stuff is worth more than gold to me.  I feel bad for those who have bad experiences with it because for me it brings much relief.,F,40,3  years1 tsp 4X D,6/29/2010,Hycodan
20, 4, Chest Cold_ Bronchitis,I felt completely Scrumptious_ Who ever invented this medicine should get the Nobel Prize. I have had asthma my whole life wnd this stuff completely relieved all of my symptoms. I think it could have a little more Hydrocodone in it_ but you just have to double up the dose. I wish I had a Barrel of it in my closet.,also goes great with Ginger ale_ if you find it hard to take Hycodan by the spoonful try putting it in a glass of Ginger ale with some ice_ 7-up and club soda work just as well_ but the Ginger Ale works better cuz it soothes the stomach_ also try it with a twist of Lemon_or lime,M,45,5  days3tbp 6X D,2/28/2010,Hycodan

24, 2, Cough,Mild sedation with 2 tsp.,"AKA ""Hydromet"".  Has a nasty cherry taste which I didn't care for (your opinion may differ).  The amount of hydrocodone didn't seem to be sufficient to squelch my sore throat.",M,44,10  days,2/25/2009,Hycodan
25, 1, cough,I immediately got very dizzy and severely nauseated with vomiting. This was after only taking one teaspoonful after eating.  Please think twice before using this drug if you think you may be sensitive to its side effects.,,F,56,1  days,1/12/2009Email,Hycodan
26, 4, Bronchitis,Nausea_ dizziness.,The side effects weren't bad enough to make me stop taking it_ because it really did get rid of my cough.  For anyone who is sensitive to codeine_ I am too_ and my sensitivity wasn't really inflamed (just a bit).,F,27,5  days,6/10/2008,Hycodan

31, 2, coughing_ bronchitis,severe nausea_ dizzyness.  This stuff is AWFUL!  Be careful.  I took 1 teaspoon the first time and felt awful for about 18 hours.  The second time I took 1/2 a teaspoon (dr recommended 1-2 tsp every 6 hours) and it was slightly better.,It calmed my cough a little but my chest was still very tight and I had to suppress my cough with sheer willpower.,M,37,2  days,4/4/2007,Hycodan
32, 5, ,,,,, ,10/6/2005,Hycodan
33, 5, constant coughing_ worse at night,none -- only good ones,Hycodan_ after trying several RX and OTC meds_ was the only cough syrup my doctor tried that DID help my consistent cough the few times of year as the weather changes_ etc (plus I'm asthmatic_ gotta watch syrups as they can worsen symptoms) I can only say good things about Hycodan as a cough medicine.  Works excellent for night time coughing too.,F,17,3  days,10/6/2005,Hycodan

Comes in generic. Shop around. Walgreens has highest price.. Walmart and target had lowest price..Also try kmart pharmacy for good price. 8 ounces of generic should cost around 16-17-18 dollars. Anything price above that try one of pharmacys I have listed above..,M,41,10  days,12/28/2004,Hycodan
37, 5, Illness,Itchiness_ euphoria_ somalince_ giddyness.,Tastes better than any liquid form of Hydrocodone_ downright pleasnt. I love this stuff.,M,26,2  years,10/8/2004Email,Hycodan
