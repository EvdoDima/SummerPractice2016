5, 1, HRT after hysterectomy,MIGRAINES_ hot to cold flashes_night sweats_rage_depression_emotional rollercoaster_pain in joints and back_sharp shooting pelvic pain_foggy head_memory problems_constant food cravings,I had been on PREMARIN 1.25 until my insurance company decided to switch to ESTRADIOL thus forcing me to change. I had been on ESTRADIOL at the very beginning of my hysterectomy and had problems with it then_that being the reason I was put on PREMARIN.After 14yrs of PROBLEM FREE HRT_I have been forced back on ESTRADIOL and the problems are the same if not worse. I started getting a migraine 3 days in and have been having them on and off with a constant headache in between since. my mind is foggy all the time_I'm always from one extreme emotion to the other_and the constant hot to freezing  flashes and sweats is enough to drive someone insane_not to mention the never ending food cravings! I will NEVER recommend this drug to anyone_much less anyone who is switching from PREMARIN for what ever reason!,F,42,3  weeks1MG 1X D,3/26/2016Email,Estradiol

7, 1, severe nightsweats_ hotflashes,I never have headaches_ however as soon as I put the patch on I developed a headache. I had shortness of breath and nasal congestion which I attribute to fluid retention. So that is very uncomfortable. I am athletic and I had gained weight prior to taking the patch and I am certain that if I keep this patch on for the month I will have 30 lbs to take off. My hot flashes and night sweats have not diminished and the worst side effect which I felt immediately was an apathetic mood... depression ( bitchy) absolutely horrible! I take antidepressants and I believe this patch cancelled out their beneficial effects.,Basically I have a lot of really bad side effect and no benefits _ so I am not happy. I couldn't wait for a week. I ripped the thing off last night. I will find other ways to deal with this. I am scheduled for blood tests and I had her check off basically everything! Cortisol   is something I believe that is having a negative effect on my hot flashes and night sweats just due to the timing of cortisol release in the blood stream.,F,49,6  days.025,2/4/2016,Estradiol

9, 1, Mild Menopause Symptoms.Memory loss,Do not recommend this for anyone that is sensitive to drugs.  I did not go in to doctor with any vaginal dryness_ I only had mild menopause symptoms.  My uterus felt like it swelled_ felt like I might have a yeast infection_ which I didn't.  Nausea and belly was hard_ but I was not constipated.  Doctor gave prescription for 1 pill just in case I did get yeast infection from the Estradiol_ but that didn't really help.  Then I started to get lower back pain and cramps off an on.  I haven't had any symptoms like this for YEARS!  Why did I start taking this?  This was only after use for one week!  Two weeks later and I am not completely better!  I went to another doctor they said be very careful when doing Estradiol cream!!!,,F,51,7  days1mg 2X D,10/25/2014Email,Estradiol

12, 1, Vaginal dryness from menopause,Severe bloating_ pain in my abdomen_ weight gain_ water retention_ dry eyes_ and muscle pain.,My gyn told me to use the Estrace Cream internally.  I took two doses.  The first dose I took on a Tuesday_ the 2nd on Thursday.  By Saturday_ my abdomen felt like I had a belt on that was way too tight.  I couldn't get my pants to button that are usually plenty big on me.  My hands were so swollen that I couldn't get my rings on without effort.  I visited my primary care dr on Monday and told him what was going on.  He said that the does was way too high and just to use a tiny bit topically and not to use the plunger.  He said that once the estrogen levels start dropping the symptoms should go away.  The swelling in my abdomen and fingers have gone down_ but my eyes were so dry last night that they were throbbing.  I woke up this morning with severe muscle and joint pain and can't turn my head.  Hopefully_ in a couple of days_ things will level out again.  Amazing what fluctuating hormones can do to our bodies.,F,53,2  days2 mg 3X W,3/5/2014Email,Estradiol
13, 1, hormone replacement,"Tried switching to generic estradiol from brand name Estrace_ due to cost. Have tried the generic several times. Every time_ within 3 days_ I felt like I was losing my mind_ severe anxiety begins on day 3. Also indescribable physical discomfort_ loss of inhibition of the rage it caused_ and very dangerous irrational thoughts and illogical thinking.This last time_ due to the unaffordability of Estrace_ I tried to ""stick with it"" as my pharamcist put it. 7 days of constantly worsening  -  basically - really losing my mind. I stopped and wentback to Estrace and was back to myself in 48 hours.All my doctors and pharmacists_ over 20 years! claim they have never heard of any reaction like this. I have tried several differentmanufacturers; all with same results.Please_ if you start estradiol_ be aware that this can happen_ and it may not be connected to the drug by any practitioner_ and it is in a way very subtle.",,F,60,7  days1 mg/day 1X D,9/25/2013,Estradiol
14, 2, Post-Full Hysterectomy,Joint pain_ sever muscle aches and pain_ sudden onset of anger and frustration_ unable to form a thought_ painful burning sensation of upper arms_ difficulty sleeping_ super hot hot flashes_ night sweats remain.,First night I took Estradiol_ I woke up feeling great for the first time in weeks. Prior to the pill_ I had been using the 0.5mg Patch_ which was not only useless but a waste of money due to it falling off in the shower. I would have to say that the pill has to many nasty effects on me physically. I didn't have this joint/muscle pain prior to taking the pill. I'm literally in pain that not even my usual pain killer will get rid of! Time to talk to my Oncologist about a natural alternative. I skipped my last dose and feel a thousand times better. Residual pain is fading_ but this stuff is wicked on my system.,F,37,7  days2MG 1X D,12/20/2012Email,Estradiol

I have a history of migraines & acid reflux so not sure if connected to starting this new combo of meds.The gas pains in chest near heart happen once daily usually in AM and feel like something terrible is happening then it stops.,F,48,25  days1mg 1X D,11/27/2011Email,Estradiol
17, 2, Post-hysterctomy Menopausal Symptom,Constant Vaginal Discharge_ Frequent Mood Swings_ Depression_ Loss of interest_ Migraines_ Cramping_ Increased Appetite,This medications literally makes me feel as if I am losing my mind. I have struggled with feeling hopeless_ depressed_ indifferent_ sad_ and angry within minutes of one another. I came to compare my symptoms with other women but I am having a tough time gauging since I am a younger patient than what it typical. I am very concerned with it's effects. I think I am going to try something else.,M,26,3  weeks1 mg 1X D,5/23/2011Email,Estradiol

19, 3, Menopausal symptoms,Migraine_ anxiety and high blood pressure,I'm in the process of weening myself off of Estradiol which I hate because it worked wonderfully for the symptoms of menopause.  Unfortunately_ my blood pressure started to rise after being on it for less than a month.  Then the headaches started until they become migraines.  Also_ this last month I started to get crushing anxiety to where I had severe chest pain.  I had previously attributed all of these symptoms to my high blood pressure.  However_ after doing research and finding other women discussing these same issues_ I found many who attributed it to being on estrogen.I plan on using phytosterols and other Chinese herbs and hope they will work as well as Estradiol without the bad side-effects.  If they don't work_ I'll ask my doctor to let me try EstroGel since it has fewer side-effects.,F,52,3  months2 MG 1X D,4/26/2010Email,Estradiol
20, 2, I never stop bleeding,None,I was prescribed estradiol 2mg/day for 25 days_ with the last 10 days also taking prometrium 200 mg/day.  I have been bleeding almost every day for 10 months.  This did not help.,F,30,20  days,1/14/2010,Estradiol
21, 5, MTF transsexual hormone treatment,Breast discharge_ breast tenderness.  I am taking this with spironolactone_ which seems to counter the fluid retention and weight gain that it might cause otherwise.  But the estrogen seems to counter some of the unpleasant side effects of Spiro_ which increases the feminizing effects of estradiol_ making for a very good hormone regimen.,Wonderful!  I take 2 mg of Estrofem (Novo Nordisk) sublingually (under my tongue) every evening.  Causes breast tenderness_ but I expect that and it does not bother me.  My breast discharge doesn't really bother me either_ except that I worry about it possibly being a sign of a serious side effect.  Fortunately_ two doctors who I have asked about that possibility say that it is unlikely.,F,24,2  years,2/23/2008Email,Estradiol
