3, 4, Myasthenia Gravis,"take your medication(s) on routine schedule everyday helps wonders to your system. When I was diagnosed and started on Mestinon I was having stomach cramps_ loose stool every 30 minutes_ had to go pee SOO BAD I was like a kid running to the potty but turns out only a little bit_  even cr*pping or peeing my pants_ bad nausea to the point where I had to lay down... Now that it's ""in my system"" and I take it in a routine schedule i only get diarrhea if it's from (no food in stomach_ stressed out_ too hot/cold_ had a sezuire {I'm epileptic} _ or walked (been on feet) too much or all day. I take protein or dairy based products to help night time cramps or help with the Time Release Mestinon.

8, 5, Ocular Myasthenia Gravis (my son),My son has twitching in his arms_ legs and stomach every now and then. He gets stomach cramping sometimes and loose bowel movements.,My son was diagnosed with Ocular Myasthenia Gravis a little over 2 years ago_ right before his 6th birthday. My husband and I noticed that my sons left eyelid was extremely droopy. After blood test and eye examinations he was diagnosed with Ocular MG. He started off taking 10mL of Mestinon 4x's a day_ then about 6 months later it was reduced to 8mL 4x's a day. Towards the end of 2013 the neurologist took a dose away and he was taking it 3 times a day. Three months ago the neurologist took away another dose so he was taking it 2 times a day. We had an appointment yesterday and she still wants my son to take it twice a day_ but she dropped it from 8mL to 6mL. This medicine is truly amazing. My son's eyelid has not drooped since he's started taking mestinon_ and all of his muscles throughout his body are very strong. I am very thankful to God for this medicine and for his neurologist and ophthalmologist. Though he does have the cramping_ twitches_ and loose bowel movements from time to time_ I think this is a great medication.,M,8,2  years60mg 3X D,8/21/2014,Mestinon
9, 2, OMG,Absolutely hate this medication. I am begging my neurologist to take me off and put me on prednisone! Horrible muscle twitches that cause cramps in my feet and calf muscles especially. Constant eye twitching and tearing that just drives me crazy. Sometimes get stomach cramps or nausea that I relieved when I eat enough prior to taking_ but that has resulted in weight gain. And_ the gas is,This is the second time I have gone back to this medication. When I was initially dx 9 yrs ago_ I tried it_ and I had very few side effects_ but I also had no symptom relief. I switched to prednisone and cell cept_ and I had amazing symptom relief. After 4 yrs_ I was able to go off all medications_ and I was medication free until 7 mo ago. Now_ I am at 60mg_ 4x per day_ plus 180mg time release at bed. No more OMG symptoms_ but the side effects are almost worse.,F,32,7  months60 4X D,8/5/2014,Mestinon
10, 3, MG,Existing uninary incontence much worse_ no longer able to hold any amount of urine.  Otherwise no other side effects. Blut the increased incontinence is so severe I am no sure it is worth contining using mestinon. Will check with neurologist about reducing dosage.,Notice a definite increase in strength.  Able to do water aerobics for 30 minutes without undue exhaustion_ which is a definite improvement.  Seems to give mild relief  to blurred vision when I am tired and facilitates reading for longer time period.,F,70,6  weeks60mg 3X D,6/15/2014,Mestinon

15, 4, MG,mild sweating_ stomach cramps_ loose bowels_ and twitching in legs...,I find the liquid dose is alot more tolerable on the GI then the pills. I take Nexium and that helps with the stomach cramps and diarrhea. Dont drink milk or eat dairy products with an hr of taking this med_ if your lactose intolerant. WIll cause more gas and other issues.--> I know from experience and other MG patients. This med has allowed me to keep wkng and be mobile...although I like to push it_ my legs will give out after to much walking. Because of more frequent bowel movements_ I do not absorb the vitamins and nutrients we need to be healthy_ have started a supplement of VIT D and VIT B's...helps with energy. Living in a tranquil lifestyle helps the immune system to stay calm and not over react...which is where our issues are...God Bless and keep positive don't let this control you_ YOU control the illness.,F,48,8  years45mg 3X D,8/29/2012Email,Mestinon

After over 20 years of undiagnosed belching_ esophageal spasms_ and choking_ I began to lose control of my constantly twitching tongue_ which caused slurred speech.  A neurologist suggested we try mestinon to rule out mg.  Blood work was negative for mg_ but mestinon has saved the day.,F,45,1  years60 mg 3X D,6/24/2012Email,Mestinon

There are days when I feel really good and it reminds me of those lovely days without MG. But the feeling of my own body as it was before- is never the same. First I experience pain _ weird pain_ then weakness and then I just cant do what I was doning anymore. exmpl. Things fall out of my arms or I suddenly just lose balance in my legs. And I cannot sing like before (used to study singing) Double vision and eye muscles- they react the best to mestinon_ legs worse.,F,25,3  months60mg 3X D,2/12/2012Email,Mestinon

23, 3, MG,frequent urination_ occassional incontinence_ upset stomach,I had a sudden onset of symptoms about six weeks ago - drooping eyelids and shortness of breath - although looking back there were some symptoms that I wrote off to other things.  The drooping eyelids was what finally sent me to the doctor/  The Mestinon has pretty much taken care of the droopy eyes_ but my other symptoms (neck hurts when holding my head at an angle - get very short of breath - have to head to the bathroom A LOT)  seem to be getting a little worse.  Have only been to see the neurologist once.

It's actually amusing to watch my legs and toes_ reminding me of the scarab beetles in THE MUMMY undulating beneath the skin_ and my toes moving independently in ways I could never do intentionally. As my MG goes into remission_ and I have reduced my dosage_ the twitching is abating. Currently I am taking 3/4 tablet at 6 am_ 10 am_ 2 pm_ and 6 pm_ and then 1/2 time-span tablet at 10 pm.,This is a wonderful drug -- a miracle_ in fact. After a sudden onset of MG_ I had a lateral robotic thymectomy. Prior to the surgery I was experiencing respiratory crises several times per week_ had double vision_ had become a clinical wimp. and was taking 90 mg of generic Mestinon every 3 hours around the clock.
