If not for Ibuprofen_ I don't know what would have become of me_ it hurt that bad. And it was continuous. I also experienced severe constipation (which is totally unheard of for me). Plus my sleep cycle suddenly changed. I though that might be because of the unrelenting pain_ but now I'm not so sure. I stopped taking it one day shy of the two week mark my Doctor prescribed.

The side effects have been so horrible and the UTI pain still exists so I discontinued med.  Should know tomorrow results of recheck culture but expect it to be positive due to continued burning.  Doctor said he already alerted Infectious Disease dept immediately after first culture to prepare for possible IV treatments.

Apparently it was responsible for an idiopathic hive response at the end of dosing (10 days) last spring that went on for weeks and only ended with steroid treatment.

I stopped after day 8 and it took about 4 days for my mood to return to a normal level.  I researched the drug.  It turns out that they are doing clinical trials on clavulanic acid_ which is part of the drug.  Evidently it has had some antianxiety reactions on primates.  If a drug can produce antiaxiety reactions_ it can produce anxiety reaction also.  Look up the side effects of antianxiety medicine.  I will never take any antibiotics that are coupled with clavulanic acid unless there are no other options.,Thanks to everyone who shared their experience.  I hope if you experience adverse side effects you will share also.  I am also curious the mg of augmentin administered in clinical trials?  I bet there is some threshold that the medical community is ignoring?  500 mg 2 times a day maybe?,M,34,10  days875 1X D,12/4/2010,Augmentin xr

66, 5, chronic sinusitis,None,Augmentin XR1000 has been my only saving grace at keeping my chronic sinusitis under control. I at least can taste and smell and there is no discharge when using it as a prophylactic.Sinus surgery was unsuccessful as well as numerous other attempts such as allergy shots_ Medications that were vaporized_etc. Thousands have been spent with this condition. My fear now is that the Augmentin is losing the sinusitis war as I have just had a tube put in my left ear. Extreme Congestion is also recurring. I will continue with the sinus irrigation and hopefully find a doctor that can help.,M,52,16  months1000 1X D,11/3/2010Email,Augmentin xr

68, 1, Sinus Infection,Jaundice. Liver disease. Projectile vomiting. Extreme fatigue. Vertigo.,I was prescribed Augmentin in 1994 when I was 13. The first side effect that I remember was when I was kneeling on the floor getting a book out of my locker and I literally thought that my school was being turned upside down. Everything in my view suddenly flipped sideways_ I became very dizzy_ and then it flipped back again. I think that happened one more time. After I had finished taking all ten days of the meds_ I became very nauseated and began projectile vomiting. This led quickly to jaundice_ liver disease_ dozens of blood tests_ weekly+ doctor visits_ 3 months in bed and out of school_ and my weight dropping to around 78 pounds; and these are just the things I remember immediately about something that happened to me as a child_ 16 years later. Not sure if this is a coincidence_ but I didn't grow anymore after that. I would NEVER give this medication to a child or in any situation that did not already pose a threat to life or limb.,F,29,10  daysunknown 1X D,10/4/2010Email,Augmentin xr

So I just started doing that procedure throughout the 5 day course of taking 2 tablets a day ... I ate ... Then ate ... Ate ate and ate ....... I made sure I was always eating good sized meals and I drank 3 litres of water a day and let me tell you it worked ..... I had still had side effects but they were no were near as powerful from the first couple days ........ At times I would literally have to force the food down my mouth with alot of water and it worked good ....... You won't feel like eating at all but .. Force at least 3 meals a day not snacks but proper portioned meals ._... And add all you can ... Eggs steak bread vegetables fruit and WATER ...

71, 3, post op infection,Nausea_ anorexia_ dehydration_ severe indigestion_ bloating_ abdominal pains_ severe joint pains.,I was prescribed augmentin 15 days post op as I collapsed with rigors. I took it religiously but spent virtually all day in bed for a week with nausea and little energy due to not eating or drinking. The joint pains started on the 2nd day. At first I thought they were due to a bacteraemia. They became so severe that I could barely walk. My doctor prescribed dihydrocodeine.

I had been on Keflex before for a similar problem and thought that was horrible_ so the doctor substituted Augmentin. 9 weeks of constant yeast infections and tendon pain are more than I intend to endure again. The tendon pain is still around 5 months after finishing the dosage. They sent me to a physical therapist for the tendon pain_ which they were unable to diagnosis_ but to no avail. I blame the Augmentin because I had not pain or previous injuries to the affected tendons before taking the drug. The side effects were way worse than my original sinus infection symptoms. As someone previous said_ I would rather DIE than take this drug again.,F,30,6  weeks500mg 2X D,8/16/2010,Augmentin xr

I was rushed to the hospital after 5 days on the medication and was admitted due to extreme dehydration and non-stop diarrhea.  I developed C.Diff (a life-threatening infection of the colon due to the good bacteria in the digestive tract either dead or injured by excessive doses of antibiotics; often leads to septic shock) and came VERY close to dying before the doctors were able to turn everything around.

I had her eat food with the meds thinking it would cut down on the side effects but no success. Today is the 5th day after she stopped taking this medication and she is still getting severe abdominal cramps_ lightheadness and fatigue.  I called the MD and he said to start her on probiotics_ to date no improvement.  I am planning on taking her in tomorrow.

I just finished my 10th day_ and am no longer coughing. The positives definitely outweighed the negatives for me. If you are experiencing stomach pain_ diarrhea_ or nausea_ I suggest taking your antibiotic with a LARGE meal (I usually just heated up a lean cuisine). Also_ it helped with I took the antibiotic at the BEGINNING of the meal_ not the end. This way_ the antibiotic gets absorbed at the same time as your stomach is digesting food_ so you stomach will feel the effects from absorption less.,F,21, 875/125 1X D,3/5/2010History,Augmentin xr

119, 1, bronchitis,Normal side effects like diarrhea however I can handle that  no big deal.  However it caused me behavioral changes such as depression_ anxiety_ irritability etc. I would definitely not recommend this for people in high stress environments or even for people with young children who have the tendency to push your buttons from time to time.  Having patience with your screaming child is difficult enough as it is and the behavioral side effects from Augmentin did not help.,I took this for bronchitis. Symptoms went a way after a few weeks_ but it was not worth the price.  Normally my screaming kids dont really bother me (I have a two year old and a 1 year old) however while on augmentin I found myself anxious_ drepessed and really up-tight.  Ill never take it again because I yelled at my kids a few times which is something ive never done prior to taking Augmentin.,M,32,2  weeks,1/23/2009,Augmentin xr
120, 1, ear infection,major joint pain and diarrhea; stomach cramps,Thank God for this site! I've never had side effects from drugs before so I thought I had fibromyalgia!

Several days after finishing the course I began to experience severe anxiety which has continued some 2 months later.

149, 4, Acute Sinus infection,Gas_ bloating_ constipation_ a little nausea and dizziness (not sure if this symptom was assoicated heavy sinus though)and weakened bladder.,With a Chronic active autoimmune Hepatitis (in remission)_ liver damage_ I am more than cautious about taking antibiotics.  I took Amoxicillin for 1st day (taken previously for sinus_ which had sent me to emerg with severe stomach pain)_doctor recommended Augmentin & Clavulanate potassium_ 625 mg x 2 daily_ which I took for a total of 9 days. Doctor  suggested a 14 day treatment for acute sinus_ but I have difficulty with long term antibiotics due to liver damage_ and understand my bodys tolerance quite well. Besides we dont really know how much of the tooth problem could be affecting the sinus condition or visa versa_ either way_ a bad infection. After researching the drug_ I also decided on lots of plain yogurt in between doses to keep the stomach as normal as possible. Overall_ the pain has lessened and facial swelling has gone down. Tooth remains to be seen_ but told this drug would help infection in this area too.,F,61,9  days,11/22/2007,Augmentin xr
150, 2, Persistent sinus infection,Terrible diarrhea; rash/hives/itching; muscle cramps in toes/feet; sore lump/extended bruising on a finger_ though I don't know how to be certain this is a side effect_ but it is surely something I've never seen before. Also having daily migraines and insomnia_ but don't know if these are necessarily side effects of the Augmentin XR.,I am on day 6 of 10_ and I feel like the cure is worse than the illness. My yogurt-banana-rice diet (what I can tolerate with the Augmentin so hard on my system) hasn't been very satisfying_ and I feel just horrible. My sinus infection may be better_ but I don't know if it was worth how awful I feel on this antibiotic.,F,48,6  days,10/17/2007,Augmentin xr

The side affects are worse than what you are taking them for.  I will NEVER take this again. Now they think I might have liver damage from such a high dose.  4000 mg a day! for 28 days. Took them for 24 days stopped almost two weeks ago and still fell just as bad if not worse than when I started.  Still have fever.  Good luck to anyone taking this med.,F,29,24  days,8/22/2007Email,Augmentin xr

155, 4, Chronic Sinusitis,None as of yet_ but I have taken this before and expereinced slight diarrera.  If you stay hydrated and eat regular amount of yogurt it goes a long way to helping offset the side affects.  Also_ take the drug exactly as stated with plenty of food.  I have had sinus surgery and several bouts with sinus infections.  Clearly the best advice is to not get sick in the first place_ but without this drug I would be in trouble.,Unless otherwise directed take the full course.  If you are on this drug in the first place it must be for a good reason.  This is nothing to mess around with and failing to complete the course can result in antibiotic resistent bacteria in your head.  I would add that learning about your body is key to managing reoccuring sinus infections.  I have found relief in using OTC drugs at key times makes all the difference.  If you feel your sinuses swelling and getting congested hit it hard with Ibrofen and a 12hour decongestent (Sudafed).  Since using this approach I avoided sinus infections for 2 years until this spring.,M,33,10  days,5/5/2007,Augmentin xr
156, 3, chronic sinus infection,I had diarrhea but took a diflucan to prevent yeast infection and the diarrhea stopped immediately.  Might be coincidence but thought I should mention it.  Now I am having severe muscle cramping in feet_ legs and back.  Again could be an interaction with other meds or maybe I need to drink more water.,,F,39,14  days,4/27/2007,Augmentin xr
157, 3, spider bite,On day two had explosive watery diarrhea that came without warning. Have continued to have very watery diarrhea but no other apparent side effects yet. I am nursing_ and my baby has some loose stools_ but so far no explosive episodes like I did. Have had some itching around the bite_ but had that before.  Now on day 3 of 10,I was aware of the diarrhea and yeast infection side effects before taking it_ but was willing to try it to save my leg. I also had a shot of cephalosporin (sp?) antibiotic on day one as well. I was glad to hear about eating yogurt and am definately going to try this. My bite has stopped spreading and the burning and overall itch and discomfort has died down - so if this is because of the Augmentin_ I'll deal with the diarrhea. I am going to call my doctor to let him know if it persists for another day_ especially after eating yogurt.,F,36,3  days,3/21/2007,Augmentin xr

I took the first 2 pills immediately after leaving the Dr's office and my fever and sore throat subsided within 24 hours !  I was able to go back to work the next day and was able to sleep finally.  The pus on the sides of my tonsils disappeared and my voice returned to normal.  I'm on day 4 of 10 right now.  The side effects were not that bad_ only some mild gas and bloating and mild stomach cramps... I've been eating a lot of yogurt and pro-biotic drinks to replenish my intestinal friendly bacteria.,M,27,10  days,9/16/2006,Augmentin xr
