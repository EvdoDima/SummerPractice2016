0, 2, Anxiety,Initially strong drowsiness_ which would also come back from time to time when my Dr increased my dose. Eventually while it did get to a point where it did not impair by ability to function during the day my partner and i did notice me having a harder time waking up in the morning.,Went to a psychiatrist because of occasional anxiety attacks (not panic attacks_ he was clear on the difference). Was expecting a script for a benzodiazepine (like Xanax or Ativan) as i had used them before and because it was not a chronic but rather an episodic issue. Instead the doc put me on 50 mg Surmontil. After about 6 weeks on it my problem with cricopharyngeal spasms (stress induced feelings of having something stuck in the throat) came back in a serious way. I actually had not had this problem in a serious way for nearly two years before going on the medication despite having other bouts with anxiety attacks. However when I reported it to my Dr. all he did was increase my daily dose to 75mg. After about a week and a half on that dose the throat spasms came back again and became a chronic issue for about a week and half again. After seeing the shrink yet again for a second time he told me to increase the dose from 75 to 100mg for two weeks and then again to 150mg thereafter. However I am not convinced at all that this stuff is working_ and would like to get off of it. I know this would require tapering it off_ but I sense my doctor would not be receptive to that and am currently searching for alternative opinions.From where I sit right now I'd rather work with a councilor or psychologist of some sort to develop coping mechanisms_ and dealing with my tendency to fixate on perceived problems (which is the source of the overwhelming majority of my attacks).,M,27,10  weeks75mg 1X D,3/11/2014,Surmontil
1, 5, Depression Anxiety,dry mouth_ sore teeth if my mouth gets too dry,I was taking 250mg at night along with another drug called olanzapine for anxiety.  I found a case study where this guy had taken loads of drugs and in many different combinations but none of them helped with his almost daily panic attacks.  He was then put on 50mg off trimipramine and he was panic free the following 6 months will on it.  I have started to take a 50mg dose in the morning and the rest of it at night.  I have been able to stop taking the olanzapine for anxiety. Stopping it has meant that i dont feel so hungry all the time. Trimipramine has helped with my IBS during the day and i feel less anxious when making journeys.,M,47,3  months200mg + 50 2X D,9/4/2013Email,Surmontil
2, 5, Depression_ IBS_ Insomnia_ Pain,None,Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.): Trimipramine and sleep and pain relief I have found trimipramine to be very good at helping me sleep and as a result of this has helped with pain relief. I have tried other antidepressants but had bad side effects. As part of my CFS/ME/ I also have IBS-D I have found the side effect of constipation has meant that I have better bowel control. I take 250 mg at night along with zolpidem which gets me off to sleep and it is the trimipramine that keeps me asleep. I have lots of anxiety with my IBS-D but trimipraime helps with this. I came off trimipramine for a week and my bowel was really bad it was not until i went back on the trimipramine that I realised what a difference it it makes to my life. I would recommend this drug to any one with ME/CFS and IBS-D.,M,47,3  months250 1X D,6/3/2013Email,Surmontil

6, 5, Insomnia/slight depression,Slight constipation. Slight weight gain_ (3 pounds ) consistent with tricyclic antidepressants.,A fabulous medication_ for me_ that was discontinued many months ago because the manufacturer sold to another company. I have now found it though_ in Canada!!! :) Cheap_ too. I take the generic. 50 mg. at night with 22 mg. Chlorazapate  for sleep and I have been on this perfect night time cocktail for 21 years. My insomnia was very bad. ( that pesky divorce! ) The 50mg. really stopped the tears and the sadness of the slight depression. It is not a theraputic dose for depression but it sure help me_ in that category.The two medications I tried_ before finding Surmontil in Canada_ were Trazadone_ then Nortriptyline. Traz._ wiped me out and after 3 months_ switched to Nortriptyline and compared to Traz._ that was great_ but then all those horrible side effects including never tasting food_ etc. became too much and after three months of it_  I went online looking for Surmontil and Eureka!!! Canada. With your Dr's._ prescription.This medication has been around for 30 years and has a great safety record. And I am sleeping soundly_ like a baby_ for 7 to 8 hours every night. Feel great all day long. Happy person_ again..lol. A good night's sleep makes all the difference in how your world looks the next day.Thank you.,F,65,21  years,12/18/2009,Surmontil
7, 1, Anxiety because of Tinnitus,Worsened Tinnitus_ new Tinnitus sounds_ hearing loss,,M,38,28  days,7/2/2009,Surmontil
8, 4, Fibromyalgia: help with sleep_ pain,Dry eyes_ mouth_ hands. Eye-drops_ drinking more water_ and nightly application of lotion to hands mostly solves these problems. I've also experienced slight acid reflux at doses over 25mg/night. But a nightly Tums seems to have solved this problem. The side effects were intolerable for me at over ~25mg/night_ but at ~20mg/night they're manageable_ and I currently plan on staying on it indefinitely.,I'm overall pretty pleased with Surmontil. I've been taking it for ~40 days now_ at a relatively low dose of 20mg/night. I'm taking it for poor sleep and for widespread body pain. It's effective on both these fronts_ but more so with sleep. It also has helped tremendously with my social anxiety (it literally almost goes away). I was worried that it would impair sexual function_ but contrary to others' experiences_ it strangely increases it for me.,M,30,40  days,4/2/2008,Surmontil
9, 5, All things considered it works,In the beginning I had a very dry mouth. Some drowsiness expescially when raised to 300 mg.It was like magic 150_200 and even 250 didn't work but after 3 weeks at 300 mg the birds sang and the sun came out. I have been taking this medication for 22 years!,At this time I take 100 mg of surmontil with 40 mg of prozac. Also 1000mg of Depekote. Things are mostly good.,M,54,22  days,5/25/2006Email,Surmontil
10, 3, anxiety caused by tinnitus,I was only prescribed 25ml per day.  I noticed after about 2 months that my muscles in my legs and arms became quite stiff,I was told that surmontil is quite successful in helping peoplewith tinnitus.  It did not reduce it but it helps with sleep.,F,41,6  months,7/7/2004,Surmontil
