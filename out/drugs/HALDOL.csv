2, 4, Schizoaffective Disorder,Mainly  loss of memory,My son has been taking this drug for about 5 months along with Abilify. It was working great for him but decided to lower the dosage gradually in 4 months from 4MG to 1 and 1/2 MG.  He did not do well with lower dosage so he up it again to 2 MG. Working great for his Paranoia and anxiety. For the past 3 years he has tried about 10 to 12 different anti-psychotic meds but the combination of Haldol and Abilify has worked the best for him.

THIS DRUG CAN AND WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE!,ER Dr. stated this was just something to relax me as I was anxious due to my being told that I was going to be admitted to hospital (unexplained elevated blood pressure and heart rate). Yes I was concerned. I even cried a little but certainly not combative! The next day my tongue had swelled so badly I could not eat drink swallow or even talk! Breathing was difficult_ my lips face and mouth were twitching puckering moving uncontrollably! Those side effects lasted 2 days only to be replaced with lockjaw_ drooling_ and loss of movement.

I use it as a last resort if I feel I am no longer able to control myself.  I don't like to take it because I don't like the way it makes me feel_ but I take it because it works.  It appears to me that those of you with bad experiences were given high doses.  I only get .5mg. My doctor told me I could cut that in half if I wanted to!

23, 1, mental breakdown,This drug is the absolute WORST!!!!! DO NOT TAKE OR LET THEM GIVE TO A FAMILY MEMBER. My brother was sent to the hospital and placed under psych evaluation for a couple days then sent to a psych hospital only to find out afterward they gave him a 150mg haldol injection.   Which is utterly ridiculous for someone with no known issues. We only found this out by probing. His effects were a mess. He had jaw locking which caused him to drool. And he seemed very restless and always wanted to move. He also had an increase in appetite of junk food.  We took him to the hospital to see what was wrong and the Dr. IMMEDIATELY stated the haldol was the issue and the dosage was to much for someone with no priot mental issues.  To counteract the effects they gave him a crogentin shot and benedryl. Almost a month later He still has some drooling and has to take benedryl.

I have suffered for over a week because of this drug that was given to me.  I have also encountered multiple doctors that do not understand why it was given to me in the first place!  Haldol is dangerous and an old antipsychotic that should not be used.  I had the gitters as SOON as it was injected into my body.  I had multiple reactions from it that caused me to miss college for days.  I am still having a high pulse from it_ a week later.  Haldol is very scary and I am now suffering health problems from it.  Not to mention the look that doctors give me when I tell them that I cannot have it.  Please do not let anyone give this to your child or anyone you love.

No way to describe other than very uncomfortable.,"This medicine did nothing for my headache. I literally drank buckets of water to try to flush this mess out of my system. I felt extremely depressed for days after taking this medicine and I wish I was never given it. When they first put the medicine in my IV_ I felt an instant panic attack_ like I was going to go crazy if I didn't get out of that bed. Thank God my husband was there. This is yet another medicine that will go on my ""do not administer"" list_ along with compazene and reglan. They should blacklist all of this stuff.

32, 1, anxiety,I was fiven haldol in place of my xanax because my panic attacks were getting worse. It made me tired n I slept like a baby till the next day I was out of it and my neck was forcing itself to the left in a way the neck isnt supposed to and my jaw went left and started bleeding I believe from my tooth cutting my cheek. It felt like my jaw was getting ripped off. This was feb 6th and today is the 24th and evrr since a part on that side of my face is basically numb. Its been almost 3 weeks an its still numb. I do chew tobacco and hope its not that but it happened the day after I took the med and after my body acted the way it did I figured it was that but I cant find anything on the numbness caused by this. Try something else not this. I couldn't walk strait and it started while I was driving. I actually had to turn my body sideways while driving so I could see because I could nt turn my neck. My fanily thought I was having a stroke at 28.  If anyone knows about the partial face numness please let me know.,,M,28,1  days,2/25/2014Email,Haldol
33, 1, Cyclic Vomiting-nausea/stomach pain,My husband was given one low dose of haldol when he went to the ER for a cyclic vomiting episode. It helped his stomach and just made him really tired at first. The next day was awful though. About halfway through the next day I noticed he couldn't speak very well. He sounded like he had something in his mouth or like his tongue wasn't moving. He said his jaw felt weird and it was hard to talk. Within the next few hours his jaw got so locked up he couldn't close his mouth! His mouth was wide open and would not close. Then his neck started getting stiff. We rushed to the hospital and he just kept getting worse while we waited. Eventually his jaw started forcing itself to the left then it would start shaking really fast and just keep pulling to the left. It got so bad he felt like his jaw was about to break and he was bleeding in his mouth! He used all his strength to force his jaw closed and hold it shut with his hands cuz it hurt so bad but it couldn't be kept closed for long. It was absolutely terrifying to see his jaw basically try to rip itself off from his face like it had a mind of its own. The Dr. said it was a side effect of haldol. It was called a dystonic reaction. They gave him benadryl and some other type of medicine that stopped the side effects thank god. I can't believe doctors give people this junk without at least a warning. I bet people have broken their own bones from the forceful muscle twisting.,,M,24,1  times5mg,1/30/2014,Haldol
34, 1, Migraine,"I was given Haldol IV in the ER as treatment for a migraine.  Immediately after being dosed I felt as if I could not breathe and started sweating profusely.  I was given benadryl IV along with the Haldol to ""prevent any adverse effects"".  It took probably 30 minutes for the symptoms to calm to where I didn't feel like I was going to completely freak out and after that I couldn't keep my eyes open but I couldn't sleep either.  It did nothing to relieve my headache or nausea and they ended up giving me IV Zofran for the nausea.  I lied and told them that my headache was gone just to get the heck out of there and went home and took my home meds to sleep.  It took 2 days before I felt somewhat normal and not edgy and shaky anymore.",I think this was a horrible treatment for a migraine and felt like hell on earth.,F,38,1  timesUnknown 1X D,1/29/2014,Haldol

The only words that could come out of my mouth were_ ""I can't think...I can't think...I can't think...etc.""  Soon after_ my head tried to physically twist around on its own like the Exorcist girl.  I had to use my hand to keep my head from twisting.  The physical pain in my body_ coupled with my brain's near vegetables state was so horrible_ I started crying_ and punching these sofas to deal with the pain.  Some time has passed before psychiatrists came back into the room I was in to give me a ""haldol side effect releaser""_ which was an injection.  They took me to my bed_ told me to sleep_ and when I woke up they said I would be better again.  I had to sleep on a certain side of my face to keep my head from turning.  I went to sleep.  When I woke up_ the pain was gone.  However_ I suffered from severe depression about a year later that lasted for two years.  Als",Never accept this drug.

But_ the benefits of Haldol far outweigh the negative_ the voices are gone (for the most part)_ and I do sleep better_ when I'm not suffering from insomnia_ my sleep patterns are far from normal_ I'm either up all night or sleep like the dead for 12 hours_ I slept 14 hours yesterday. I also have a decreased appetite_ I forgot to eat yesterday_ and that's not the first time that's happened. I realize I don't have the severe reaction to this drug that other people have_ but as I said_ the benefits far outweigh the negative. I would reccomend this drug for those people suffering from schizophrenia_ voices_ and anger issues_ since I began the Haldol my anger issues have disappeared_ which is why I can see it being prescribed in a prison setting.,M,45,7  months4mg 1X D,1/20/2013Email,Haldol

I was taunted by medical staff until I became annoyed. They then used my annoyance as a false reason for physically beating me and administering this. It left me shrieking in agony and swollen everywhere. It made my heart beat too fast and immediately gave my a panic attack. My condition immediately declined 3000% after being given this. It has ruined my face by stretching it out and I had trouble speaking for months after. It closed my throat so badly I could not breathe and feared for my life. This will haunt me for the rest of my life. I am suffering post-traumatic stress from this and I have nightmares about this vulgar poison that nurses use because they are too lazy to do their jobs. I contemplate suicide because this drug and the deranged nurses who gave it to me have ruined my life. This drug should be illegal.,M,21,  1X D,11/25/2012Email,Haldol
51, 5, many things_ especially schizophren,none!,I agree most nurses in the psychiatric ward are dumb when it comes to knowing about the effects of varying doses of Haldol. Haldol should only be given twice per day with a maximum single dose of 2 mg!!The way I'm taking Haldol is almost like a miracle. It increases my appetite_ TAKES AWAY dry mouth_ diarrhea_ severe anxiety_ suspiciousness_ violent racing thoughts and impulses_ OCD and worsened schizophrenia symptoms associated with a really bad rejection from a really sexy girl who I was dangerously in love with_ and my tourettes. I really_ really_ really hope Haldol is never taken of the market! The answer is MODERATION. I really hate reading peoples negative and ignorant comments about Haldol_ Haldol cam absolutely be abused by dumb or in fact EVIL nurses. 2mg Ativan comes down anxiety restlessness and panic that Haldol causes especially when Haldol is used in an intelligent and responsible manner. I strongly disagree with chemically restraining people with massive doses or even 5mg of Haldol. The key is prevention using Haldol safely and smartly_ not abusing Haldol and torturing a patient after the poor person's mental health has been ignored_ just for the convenience of hospital staff. 0.5 mg Haldol decreases the amount of dopamine binding to the D2 receptors through out the brain by 50% which is a very comfortable feeling in the state of a mental illness episode and mental illness. I am disappointed to hear all of the negative news about Haldol.						,M,21,2  weeks0.5 mg 2X D,11/7/2012Email,Haldol

69, 1, Agitation_ Mania,Extremely dry mouth_ muscular contortions_ unintelligible slurred speech_ drooling_ inability to urinate_ elevated heart rate_ over-sedation_ incoordination_ involuntary movements_ muscle rigidity_ tremors,I don't recommend haldol. This is an old_ outdated drug with a multitude of harmful side effects_ and there are much better drugs now that are far more effective. These days haldol is used mostly to treat agitation in prisoners and psychosis in mental patients. It Is like a chemical straight jacket_ or at higher doses_ it is more like a lobotomy.I was given haldol in 1976 when I was 17 for agitation_ a horrible experience. I lost muscle control on one side_ couldn't walk_ couldn't pee_ felt agitated but could hardly move or function_ also caused drooling and uninteligable slurred speech. I was started on 10 mg and the dose was reduced to 1 mg. The side effects were still very problematic on 1 mg of haldol. The medicine for side effects was not very effective.Haldol is not for use in psychotic conditions related to dementia and may cause heart failure_ sudden death_ or pneumonia in older adults. During his end stage cancer_ my father at age 79 was on 1 mg for nausea and did not look at all peaceful on this drug. He looked very uncomfortable_ was unable to speak and his mouth was sandpaper dry.My grandmother age 93 was given 5 mg for agitation_ and was barely able to move or speak_ and she looked very uncomfortable. Her heart rate became so elevated her doctor worried that she would have a heart attack.A younger friend of mine took haldol for schizophrenia which helped_ but not without disturbing side effects like tremors and tardive dysconesia.,F,53, 1mg-10mg 1X D,9/7/2011Email,Haldol

My mother had severe and continuous hallucinations even being prescribed an anti-hallucinagen back in early 80's when Haldol first surfaced for mentally ill patients as the new go-to drug. Mother on the surface seemed to be getting better but still suffered dillusions_ had sleeping problems_ all the same issues prior to Haldol.,Run from this drug. My mother committed suicide unexpectedly as we thought she was getting better meanwhile the anti-hallucination med wasn't working like we thought. She was leaving hints to my father and others and I didn't put the pieces together until after she died. This happened in Feb. 1982 and one year later_ Haldol was supposed to be taken off the market due to the ridiculous number of suicides in a small amount of time over a year. How the drug company kept this drug active is beyond me. This is not a new drug and most Drs. don't even know how dangerous this drug is. If it wasn't for the greedy drug companies_ this drug would not have been used for psychiatric patients and taken off the market. I don't even know what the physical ramifications were for my mother as she wasn't communicating her issues after taking this medicine as many mentally ill patients don't always. I was 8 months pregnant and lost a lot. Be careful with this drug and don't use it unless absolutely necessary. There have been many many people who have committed suicide after taking this drug quite unexpectedly. In 1983_ when I heard how dangerous Haldol was on the 6:00 national news_ I was shocked!

Thank God my Mom obtained both MRI and CAT scan results to prove those people wrong.  Therefore_ I strongly recommend to have your physician test other medications before agreeing to take either Haldol or Halcion.,F,36,1.5  months,2/8/2005Email,Haldol
145, 1, my 90 yr old mother was taking it,She got really psychotic and extremely anxious after taking it.,Before that she was on the me-too drug_ Seroquil for 8 months. Both are extremely dangerous in old people with dementia. Did not help at all.,F,90,8  months,12/25/2004Email,Haldol
146, 1, anxiety,Heavy mental and physical stagnance. Strong sedation_ retarded feeling.,I was on the stuff a few months when I was a preteen and I didn't know to think much of it then_ but the second time I was on it later in life.Agh... The stuff was too stagnating I had to keep relooking at stuff I just had my eyes on. So I drank a bunch of coffee and that didn't help. Even though I have anxiety I was so out of it I called up an old friend that was a drug dealer and I asked him for some free coke so I could wake up. He came over with a couple eight balls and I snorted up half the bag. When the coke started to hit me my toung was out of my mouth swinging back an forth all over the place and my eyes were rolling up so I said to him maby we could chill later cause I'm really not feeling good right now so he left. Later on that day my legs just felt shaky as hell and I felt like I needed to walk around. I know it wasn't the coke because it never did anything like that to me before. So I just plain stopped taking the haldol. Haldol just wasn't the right kind of medication to treat my anxiety.,M,23, ,11/5/2004Email,Haldol

148, 3, Bipolar,Extreme weight gain_ sleepyness_ memory loss_ unable to focus as usual.,It is the ONLY medication that worked for me.  The news anti psychotics do not work for me.  So I am stuck.
