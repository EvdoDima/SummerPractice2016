1, 1, eye infection,agitation_ insomnia_ depression_ tendonitis_ sinuses swelled shut_ asthma reared up_ this was quite a horrible experience.  They are not unusual reactions to any drug that is a fluoroquinolone_ but nobody believes EYE DROPS will do this.  But they do.  They roll down inside the tear duct and into the spongy absorbent nasal tissue and BAM!  THe only way to get a more intense dose would be to inject it i.v..  This stuff is horrible.  I wanted to be dead by the end of it.,I've had bad reactions to other fluoroquinolines and told the Dr. this_ but she blew it off.  NEVER AGAIN.  From now on I'll just tell them I'm allergic to it and save myself the 10 days (effects keep on even once you stop taking it) of hell.,F,50,6  days,8/26/2008,Quixin
