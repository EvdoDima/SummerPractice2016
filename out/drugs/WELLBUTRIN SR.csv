1, 4, Depression_ADHD_bipolar.,At first: jittery_ dizzy_ constantly hungry_ REALLY thirsty_ and increased sex drive (which is negative_ since I was already demanding it 2-3x a day from boyfriend pre-med). Now: sex drive has evened out_ so has appetite. Lots of energy_ sleep well_ vivid dreams.,I was iffy about this when my psychiatrist prescribed it. I was on the highest safe dose of Setraline (Zoloft) for 5 months. It quit working after 3 months_ when I overdosed in a suicide attempt. Now with the Buproprion (Wellbutrin)_ I feel amazing!!! I have energy_ I can't just lay in bed all day like I use to-even if I wanted to. I have motivation to get up and clean the apartment daily_ whereas I use to do it once a month at most. My bf said I seem a lot happier_ more talkative_ less angry all the time_ less snappy. Also_ I was trying to quit smoking cigarettes before I ever started this med_ but once I took it my cravings for cigs just vanished!!!! After research_ I found that this is clinically proven to help quit smoking. So that's just another benefit. ;) I really do like this drug so far. I've been on countless drugs since being diagnosed with an array of mental disorders at 15_ and none have works as well as this one. I just hope my appetite dies down and I lose weight!!!!,F,19,2  weeks100mg,6/17/2016Email,Wellbutrin sr
2, 1, Bipolar depression,Positive: increased sex driveNegative: increase in suicidal thoughts_ increased negative thoughts_ worse depression_ crying_ feeling disconnected from world_ time distortion_ stiff neck_ vivid dreams. No effect on appetite_ no effect on sleep after day 3.,I really wanted this to work_ and the first two or three days were promising - I felt slightly wired_ more awake_ no desire to rest during day_ but was able to sleep at night. Depression remained about the same. During the second week (still on 150mg)_ I started to feel disconnected from everybody else. Depression got worse_ with feelings of total worthlessness and hopelessness_ and could not concentrate on anything_ constantly distracted. On day 14 I doubled the dose to 150mg twice a day. Big mistake. Thought about suicide all the time_ felt I was already dead_ like a ghost. Time moved very slowly_ every minute felt like an effort to live through. Also became scared of being left alone and asked my husband not to leave me alone for a minute (very unusual for me_ I'm usually quite independent). Stopped medication yesterday and already feel a bit better.,F,56,17  days150 1X D,5/1/2016Email,Wellbutrin sr
3, 5, Depression and Anxiety,The first 3 days were like how other describe as a mild acid trip. There was no sleeping. After that things normalized quickly until i did not even noticed i was on any meds except i was less depressed. The anxiety took a few years to get under control. I also get 30x0.5mg xanax a month to stop any panic attacks when they start. I have never needed to increase my benzo because i refuse to use them in a way that builds tolerance. I may go a few days without taking one then i will have an attack and may need 3 over the course of the day. I didnt think much about drinking on Wellbutrin because i didnt notice a difference. Then i have read horror stories about combining drinking and Wellbutrin. I do not have those or any other ill effects but i dont recommend it for others due to what i read,,M,48,1  days300mg,3/5/2016,Wellbutrin sr
4, 2, Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction,Light stimulation for half an hour when took 2 grams. Lower doses do nothing.,Thought it would revive my libido as I have PSSD. It did not. Had no effect when taken at 150 mg once a day_ so i took 13 150 mg tablets all at once (and crushed them first) (dangerous - do not repeat_ risk of deadly seizure). Had light stimulation from that dose for a short while. No other side effects noticed. A very weak med for me. Expected more.,M,22,1  weeks150 mg-2 g 1X W,2/9/2016Email,Wellbutrin sr

9, 4, Depression,"Worked pretty well except it kicked in hypomania sometimes because I'm bipolar II  so we had to lower the dose. But unfortunately after a time_ it made me lose 18 pounds and I was already very slim  5'10"" inches and size 6.  I looked anorexic and I had to eat like a horse just to maintain my low weight.  It was out of control.",If you need to lose weight_ I might be a great option for you.  I love that it didn't suppress my sex drive .,F,48,30  days 1X D,10/30/2015,Wellbutrin sr
10, 1, Anxiety Depression,"After 18 -you can only put up to 10 on the drop down menu here- 18 years plus on wellbutrin sr and thinking all of the hell I was going through on a daily basis was ME and that this was helping me from being even worse- I stopped taking it because I had extensive dental surgery and found out how it felt to be ""normal""..even happy...",I was put on many SSRIs that did not work. Doctors targeted my depression which was caused by my horrible anxiety. I got stuck with this drug as it is not an ssri as we found out the hard way_ I could not tolerate ssris. People with anxiety READ THIS. 1. Docs are told to rx benzos with wellbutrin because it CAUSES anxiety. 2. Wellbutrin is processed by the body and turned into an AMPHETAMINE!!I started out life as a productive member of society and was turned into a sleepless_ anxiety-ridden zombie reliant on benzos to keep the effects of the wellbutrin in check. Up to 6 mg of ativan. It took my memory_ my patience_ my ability to sleep...everything. If you have anxiety do not even consider this med. It may work for depression_ but  exacerbates anxiety!! Please let my story help you. Docs never told me this during my many hospital stays_ reg. pdoc visits etc. Even though I was in horrible pain from my dental surgery... my mind felt happiness I have not felt in over 20 years once off wellbutrin sr. If you need to taper_ look up how. I didn't. I went back on it two times and that was two times more hell_ nightmares and prayers to God that my body could make it through one more time...I had to be sure wellbutrin was the cause though.Also_ get your hands on Dr. Claire Weekes books_ tapes whatever and listen to them over and over. They will bring you some peace while you recover. She is an angel for people like us! Good luck! Contact me if you want.,F,48,10  years400 MG,10/23/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
11, 4, Depression,I recently started experiencing brain fogginess and dizziness. Three years ago I experienced severe Vertigo with heaving. I attributed this new feeling with that. I was so dizzy at home this weekend I yelled my husband's name and he caught me as I hit the floor.I went to my ENT this morning and after a series of tests_ including one with the audiologist_ he is sure it's the Wellbutrin.  I really don't want to stop it. I need to know if this is normal after one and a half months to first begin. I also now know where my itchiness is coming from after reading comments on this thread.,Will the dizziness and fog end? It began recently_ at least one month after beginning.,F,60,1.5  months150MG 1X D,10/5/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
12, 3, Bipolar depression,dry mouth_ rash_ food taste different_ heart rate fluctuates.,This drug gave me the kick in the ass I needed to start moving. Just felt like I was in a hole with no way out. I started walking on my treadmill and dieting. I am afraid I will be a person with weight gain on this medication. My weight was a factor in my depression. I have such bad dry mouth that at times I find myself biting on the sides of my tongue. I take melatonin to go to sleep. So far so good. I just feel like my eyes hurt and they aren't open enough. So I try to keep them open wide which gives me a headache. Everyone is different with meds. I can tell you as I sit here drinking my tenth bottle of water today that dry mouth is terrible. I am hoping this drug will be successful.,F,37,2  months100 mg,9/10/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
13, 2, Depression_ social phobia,Nausea_ vomiting_ hot flashes accompanied by sweating_ extreme dizziness_ headaches_ decreased appetite_ weight loss.,I was prescribed Wellbutrin SR along with my Prozac and Klonopin_ as my Prozac didn't seem to be helping my depression. After a month of taking this medication_ I'm still experiencing intense side effects. I can't tell if this medication has helped my depression at all. The side effects don't seem like they are going to cease_ and they are almost unbearable.,F,23,1  months200 mg,6/9/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
14, 5, Major depression,None.,Changed my life. I was on cipralex for 8 months with no improvement_ after 2 weeks on wellbutrin I started to feel like myself again.

16, 5, anxiety_ insomnia_ low mood,Slightly increased desire for sweet things and increased appetite but this tapered off over a couple of weeks.After about a month I could sleep again and my concentration iimproved. Anxiety also much better. Didn't actively try to quit smoking but this got me to kick the habit within a month. Only thing is drinking is not a good idea...blackouts. The doctor thinks I may have been misdiagnosed and that my troubles are related to ADD.,This medication has given me back the ability to sleep through the night.It has changed my life.,F,31,3  months150 mg,5/20/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
17, 1, Bipolar_ Cig Smoking,No side effects_ but this medication was pure crap! Might as well have taken a placebo.,I didn't have any side effects at all but it didn't do a thing for me. My doc kept raising my dose_ still didn't help_ finally told her I refused to keep wasting money on her upping my dose for an ineffective med. I have bipolar and my docs insist I take an anti-depressant even though I am manic type bipolar_ I don't have depression but they insist it will help ease anxiety. It was about as effective as a placebo. Also_ I was told it'd help me quit smoking. Wrong. Went from smoking one pack of cigs every 4 days to smoking almost an entire pack per day. It made me feel like I wasn't getting nicotine at all_ unacceptable to be running outside to smoke every 45 mins.,F,29,42  days50 1X D,5/6/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr

I had a health issue that I was concerned about and because I cried in his office he thought I was depressed.  I was no where near depressed.  I was just an extremly busy and overwhelmed professional.  I guess his wife does not work so he has no clue what a motivated woman looks like!

31, 4, Mood Swings And Depression,My Doctor who keeps up with the drugs very well says it's a well known fact that Wellbutrin Generic doesn't work as effectively as the name brand. After doing research I found that Watson brand releases in a very close way as the name brand.  If you are having problems I suggest asking your pharmacy if they can get the Watson brand.  Other manufacturers caused hives and itching horribly.  The only down side to this drug is the increase in heart rate and blood pressure.  It's the best!!  Most anti depressants had horrible side affects for me.,,F,49,2  years150 2x day,4/21/2014Email,Wellbutrin sr

I experienced sever gastritis to the point two doctors said I needed to have my gallbladder removed.  When back to the 150 mg pill and all was fine.

34, 1, Depression-Quit Smoking Aid,Weight gain_ anger_ binge eating_ constipation_ weird dreams,It did help take the edge off smoking_ but the other side effects were too much.

35, 4, Depression_ smoking cessation,Dramatically improves my depression. Improves my lethargy. Improves my sleep from being tired during the day and sleeping 12 to 16 hrs per day to sleeping normally and being able to stay awake all day. Side effects: zyban allergy (cysts under skin and rash on chin -- severity depends on dose)_ homicidal thoughts and aggressive actions_ increased spectrum of feelings especially joy and anger_ irritability and feeling of being out of control like yelling at service people over sometimes insignificant things_ adrenaline rush_ flushing face_ crying when I wake up_ tears when I laugh_ burning pain in head when I'm startled_ panic at the dentist_ ready for a fight_ sexual promiscuity and intense orgasms_ fear of heights_ overstimulation under pressure (like while speaking in public).,Started taking this med for smoking cessation and did quit smoking. I've taken all forms: zyban_ wellbutrin_ and bupropion -- all the same. Stopped this med but started again a few times with no change in effectiveness.  I took Prozac in the past which didn't help much. I only take Wellbutrin and no other medicines except vitamins. I'm normally a calm and mild-mannered person and never experienced such physical anger_ hatred_ or panic as I have on this medicine. Lowering the dose helps. The side effects go away when I stop taking the medicine_ but my depression (sleeping all the time_ feeling of overwhelming sadness) returns. People with any kind of violent or aggressive past shouldn't take it. People who are normally anxious probably shouldn't take it.,F,40,12  years100 2X D,3/10/2014,Wellbutrin sr
36, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Dry mouth_ bad breath_ sleep disruption_ dizziness_ ticks.,This drug really helps my depression.  I've tried coming off it many_ many times.  Though I do succeed_ within one month I'm back on it.  When I do come off_ I sleep much better and feel better immediately_ but my sexual function declines and my weight increases rapidly and eventually the negativity and dark mood return.  After cutting back to 150 mg. per day for 36 days I plan on increasing my dosage again tomorrow.  This time I plan on cutting out the caffeine completely.  Maybe that will cut down on the sleep disruption and the ticks.  Unfortunately_ it looks like I'm on this for life but am unsure about the long-term consequences.  I just need to face it -- depression stinks_ but it beats cancer_ blindness_ deafness_ or going through life without limbs.  In the end_ Wellbutrin does work work for me.  If I'm lucky enough that I can pop a few pills and get it under control it's best just to quit whining_ count my blessings and do it.,M,49,7  years150 mg. 2X D,1/9/2014,Wellbutrin sr

38, 4, depression. add. chronic fatigue,I know add and fatigue don't seem to relate. I don't have add but have symptoms_ scatter brain_ forget everything_etc. Anyways.. Very early. But I was looking for early side effects when I found this site (I have been on several different anti-depressants and know these side effects typically go away.) So far... anxiety. Insomnia. ZERO appetite (and I am a binger). headache. Shakes. Alertness. Yawns are gone! Frequent urinating_ slight nausea (which could be because I can't eat!)... Will update review in a couple weeks!,,F,34,4  days100 mg x 2,11/22/2013Email,Wellbutrin sr
39, 4, Major Depression,Initially: more energy_ need less sleep_ wake up a bit easier_ slight loss of appetite. After a few days: a bit tense_ a bit aggressive and easily upset_ fuzzy head. The last time I took it and after I had stabilized: Almost no side effects. Maybe a slight increase in libido_ slightly more easily agitated and this seemed to correlate with caffeine consumption.,This is my second time taking it. Last time I took a generic Bupropion XL at 300mg/day then 450mg/day when I was continuing to feel depressed. After my body stabilized on the dose I was very comfortable and I feel like the drug would receive a 5 rating. Right now_ however I am readjusting to taking it and it's not a super smooth transition so 4 star for now. I am not sure if SR 1x/day is enough for me but I'm trying to start slowly even though I was in crisis with my depression as of 9 days ago. I may increase to 150mg SR 2x/daily (morning and afternoon) and might be interested in going to XL again at 300mg/day. I've heard it takes 2-3 weeks for your body to adjust to a dose so I'm trying to hold off making changes for the time being. I was really pleased with this drug the last time I took it which was from 2009-2011. I feel like I had the energy and drive to do what I wanted to do with my life then. The last 2 years have been a steady decline in my life. It's hard to tell if it was from being off the drug or from other life issues_ both_ or which caused which. I hope to be charging hard again and since this is about my 4th time having to take an anti-depressant I figure I might be a 'lifer' with drugs now.,M,37,8  days150 1X D,11/13/2013Email,Wellbutrin sr
40, 4, Smoking cessation,At first_ the drug is incredibly disorienting. You sort of feel like your in a dream_ time passes slower_ your face is fuzzy and although you can see what is happening around you_ you can't really analyze the situation itself_ leaving you confused as to what happened. Soon_ you recover_ the side effects wear off_ and the results start to show. After only 5 days_ I bought a pack of cigarettes but realized I no longer found pleasure in smoking. I didn't even finish the cigarette. I'm no longer fighting an urge to smoke because simply there's no longer a desire to fulfill. Best smoking aid I've tried; it puts nicotine patches and gum to shame.,,M,19,5  days150,11/12/2013,Wellbutrin sr
41, 2, depression,,I was taking wellbutrin xl @ 450 mg for a long time without really many issues. Then I ended up having my prescription refilled by another doctor who mistakenly prescribed wellbutrin sr @ 450 mg_ one time daily. I was dealing with a major family crisis that was objectively getting a lot more difficult_ so I just thought that I was more anxious than normal because of that. Go to a new doctor_ and she recognized the error that I was taking pretty much 3x what I should be taking in one dose. It explains problems in concentration during work_ and exhaustion at night. Feel dumb I didn't pick this up. More frustrated that the doctor didn't know to just do the most cursory check.,F,,3  months450 mg 1X D,9/25/2013,Wellbutrin sr

43, 1, Depression_ bipolar,In the beginning it worked well on the 3rd_ I was increased to 450mg_ had a Grand mal seizure_ went to the er. Did all the tests EEG MRI ct scan. Everything came back normal. Neurologist thought it was the saphris_ so my pdoc kept me on it lower to 150mg twice a day. 4months later 2nd grand mal seizure. This time not quite lucky last thing I remember_ I was standing by kitchen top juicing (seizure happening here) then the next thing i remember in a extremely dream state_ I was struggling with someone(my wife) trying to 'escape' to our front door. We struggled to door that's when I start to really come to and realize that person I was struggling with was my wife & she was repeating 'you had a seizure...' Over & over. I sat down in disbelief that it happen for a 2nd time. Went thru the same battery of tests everything was clear. Seizure could only been drug induced the neurologist said.When my pdoc say On a lower dose it is safe. I have no medical history of seizure nor tested positive for being epileptic.It's sad because this was the only drug that was working for me. But it's not worth the risk. It's 1 in every 1000 at low doses that's not a low. And the actual seizure that gets reported is way higher than that. So if you are on it or put on it watch your dosage closely.,,M,32,6  months150mg 2x,9/21/2013Email,Wellbutrin sr

52, 1, Depression_ weight loss,I wanted to quit Lexapro b/c I had gained 50 lbs_ so I asked for Wellbutrin. Switching to Wellbutrin SR was a big mistake. It gave me severe headaches that wouldn't respond to OTC pain relievers_ vertigo-like brain zaps_ and sent my anxiety levels thru the roof. Also made me feel very mean and snappish. After reading more online_ I discovered that many people do not recommend it if you suffer from anxiety. Apparently Lexapro was doing more for my anxiety issues than I had realized. After one week on it_ I called my dr_ who said to give it a few more days. I gave it another week_ but I just couldn't tolerate it any more.,,F,34,2  weeks150 2X D,5/20/2013,Wellbutrin sr

55, 5, Depression,Side effects: slight headache for first 2 or 3 days. Other than that nothing else as of yet. This medication is truly wonderful! I used to be such an energetic person_ but last year I had a very short duration of abusing pain meds that I was prescribed for a lot of dental work. The episode was brief thank God and I'm no longer taking any pain meds or any type of illegal drug. However_ I noticed that I was becoming less energetic_ much less_ absolutely no interest in taking any of my friends phone calls_ would stay in and just watch T.V. all the time when I was not working. Sometimes I would not have enough mental or physical energy to take my dog out. I was so depresed and just didn't care about anything at all. WOW!!!! this med has literally changed my life! I am completely myself again and probably better than I've ever felt. I'm so focused with great energy and great mood. I know some people are reporting unfavorable side effects_ I had the headache and some neck discomfort. But_ please give this med a chance if you are experiencing more and or worse side effects_ they do go away. It's very worth it. If you have some trouble sleeping the first few days just take some Melatonin. Please be well and I know this med will work wonderful for you as well!,,F,38,6  days150 x2/day,4/8/2013,Wellbutrin sr

This drug appears to be too strong even after 2 days - worried that continued use may cause permanent dependence or side effects.

Back in the day when they discovered  this drug helps with smoke cession it' s cost went from 10 dollars a month to 150 a month. At that time I decided to go off of Wellbutrin. After a month without the drug I realized that the drug helped me get out of bed and function in the real world. Without the drug I couldn't hold a conversation with anyone without becoming overwhelmed and anxious. I couldn't leave the house without feeling doom and gloom. My world was turned upside down I must say it  works for me . I have a lot of pains and aches_ sweats. I really can't contribute this to Wellbutrin. I have tried Paxil_ Buspar _ Xanax_ and many assorted drugs that are supposed to help. Wellbutrin is the only one that I can tolerate that works for me  . I am also a smoker and when I am on Wellbutrin I have really cut back a lot. .

59, 5, Inattentive ADD_ depression_ anxiet,"For the first week: felt fine_ a little nauseous_ a couple of crying spells_ sleepiness. Second week: euphoria_ very slight nausea_ a sense of calm and well-being_ some problems focusing. By the third week_ I felt my body adjusting to the medication. Nausea went away_ I noticed I was able to focus better than I had been able to in months_ little things that I'd normally get stressed out about no longer bothered me. By the fourth week_ I noticed a huge difference in my overall mood and attitude. This medication has made a world of a difference in my life. In the past I have taken SSRIs_ which were a COMPLETE nightmare. Then years later I realized most of my depression and anxiety stemmed from being ADD. This realization was a huge breakthrough and set me on the path to the correct treatment. I tried adderall_ which of course helped enormously but I hated that I was so aware of the med itself. I could feel it as soon as it ""kicked"" then is become irritable and tired as it wore off. All day I'd be running around like a coke-head and at night I'd become a zombie. It was an awful feeling. I could focus great! But needed something steady and consistent in my system. My doctor suggested Wellbutrin sr (bupropion sr) - I was willing to give it a shot! And I'm so glad I did! It's been a complete life-saver. I can concentrate better_ but in a more subtle way compared to adderall.

For the first few doses that I startded taking 2 pills I took them both in the morning (bad idea). I was great throughout the morning but as soon as the drug wore off(about 6 hrs later) I physically couldnt stop crying. Strangest thing. I called the doctor scared for I might hurt myself_ she informed me I was taking the drug incorrectly_ that I should take 1 in the morning and the other 6 hrs later. I obvioulsy read the lable wrong. BE CAREFUL for this. Since I started paying more attention and taking the medication correctly I havent been happier. I am not a smoker_ and have heard of this helping to quit. I do socially drink and I havent had the urge to drink since I started taking the medication. I am extremely happy. Also I am taking the generic version and I think it is getting the job done (might not for some people) so there is hope in not spending a ton to get results.

I was doing well on it until about 3 weeks in when I noticed that my behavior was getting a little erratic_ and I started getting pretty paranoid. At that time I cut down to only taking 150 mg a day (only in the morning). That seemed to help me out a bit. Then_ at about 4 weeks I started getting itchy. Where I was itchy I started noticing welts or hives. Bumps that were small_ long_ short_ large_ whatever. Very itchy though. I would scratch so much I would end up bleeding. Also_ my palms were quite itchy.Anyway_ I quit taking it about 4 weeks in. That was almost 3 weeks ago and I still get itchy and I am still getting the hives. I have a doctor's appointment on September 9th. I am starting to wonder if it really screwed me up_ or if something else is causing the itching.All in all_ I would recommend Wellbutrin to others as a smoking cessation aid.

I'm not fat (5'4""_ 120 lb) but i always cared a lot about my weight_ and now i suffer for not doing gym (no energy for gym nor a good walk). These first 3 pills gave me hope:i feel more connected to the world and reality and have little increased energy. No decresead appetite so far. No big binges though.

99, 5, Depression/ cyclothymia,Started Wellbutrin about 12 years ago. started on 100mg- throughout the years it has gone up and down and both Wellbutrin SR and XL. The most I have ever taken is 300mg XL. I love this drug. Side effects: no depression_ weight loss_ increased libido_ ability to have an alcoholic drink without getting crazy_ happiness_ motivation_ increased concentration. annoying but manageable side effects; headache_ anxiety_ dry mouth_ shaky hands at times_ impatience_ sometimes I can't remember dreams.,This is the best drug for my situation. I have cyclothymia (i have been diagnosed with both cyclothymia and bipolar_ but I personally don't think i have bipolar_ because i don't get manic). I was off WB for the last two years_ but just had a pretty bad depressive episode and decided to go back on it. So I have been back on WB for about 5 weeks and its doing good. I am not depressed_ I have my motivation back_ remembering my dreams_ more organized. This time around I am getting some anxiety_ so I started on Buspar to counter act that_ and the combo is working really well for me. This is not a good drug for people with anxiety however.,F,35,12  years100mg 1X D,6/24/2011,Wellbutrin sr

It did take away the depression within days but I would wake up 10 times per night even though I am taking tamazepam to sleep. I completely lost my appetite and lost 5 pounds in one week. I could force myself to eat but the insomnia was unbearable. I usually take the tamazepam occasionally but I have had to take it  every night with this medicine. I have been off it for 3 days and I still cannot sleep without the tamazepam. The anxiety is terrible. I am scared to leave the house or be without my husband.

105, 4, Depression_ Anxiety_,So far the side effects are min. I had orriginally the shakes_ grinding teeth_ and excessive energy. However_ they went away fairly quick. I was suppost to go up to 150 x 2 day.  Once I did that I got a terrible Ringing in the ears. I called the doctor and went back to 150 x1day and the ringing has gone down way down in just a week and is slowly going down_ Decreased appetite_ Very nice dreams_ Slight head pressure if I don't take it on time.,I am taking Bupropine 150 sr.  150 mg x 1 day.  I started 3 weeks ago and the side effects were minimal. When I increased the dose I notice ringing in the ears_ and a slight head ache. Apparently that was too much for me as I went back down to once a day and it has subsided. I already feel much better. I had no idea I was depressed until the doctor gave me an evaluation. I knew I was plagued with anxiety_ but never would have guess that it was also depression. I didn't want to play with my new born daughter_ even looking at my husband made me sick (I know so sad) and I wanted to sleep all day long! after about 3 doses I had so much energy_ after about a week I was waking up before my alarm clock_ and now its leveling out but still feel like a weight off my shoulders. I am a mother_ full time student_ full time worker_ and a wife so I really had a lot on my plate I guess. I am slowly getting off of Zoloft as that cause me severe weight gain (I am on weight watchers for the longest time and was always 125-137lbs) now I am 162 with consistant weight watchers diet! Just kept gaining and wanted to eat everything in sight. So far I have not lost any weight on buproprine however_ My appetite is so low that I have to remind my self to eat. I think its just taking time for the zoloft to get out of my system as I was on that for 2 years. I am down to 50mg 1x day zoloft and should be off of it with in a week or so. I will keep you posted I am hoping that my weight does come down.,F,25,3  weeks150 1X D,2/11/2011Email,Wellbutrin sr
106, 3, bipolar/depression/anxiety,Major lack of appetite_(losing 5lbs a week). Not healthy in my case because of recovering eating disorder_ and not to mention that I'm now underweight. I have to remind myself to eat throughout the day because I'll forget! Feels like I have no sensation in my stomach_ can only hear it growl. And when I do eat_ it's very small portions. I have noticed some constipation and bloating_ but I think that's subsiding. I felt like I just wasn't digesting correctly for weeks! Has anyone experienced any lower back pain? I've been dealing with that since starting the medicine_ but not sure if it's associated...,I first started Wellbutrin SR at 75mg for 3 days_ then increased to 150mg for 3 weeks. I had no cognitive side effects-if anything I felt that my brain was able to function better and concentrate. I noticed a slight positive change in my overall mood_ but nothing significant. 150mg is kind of a low dose_ and it had only been a few weeks so I figured I wouldn't give up quite yet. One thing to remember is that every medication works differently for every person. I think that metabolism_ body weight_ what kind of illness all are factors in determining when and if it will work. Don't knock it before you try it. So after the 3rd week on 150mg_ my dose was increased to 300mg XL in the am. I took this dose for 3 days and felt completely delusional_ irritable_ anxious_ extremely lethargic. I called my Dr and she told me to go back down to 150mg for now until I felt better. I am quite sensitive to medication_ so titrating for myself will take some time. I haven't experienced any sexual benefits or side effects_ insomnia or dry mouth so far... Believe me_ I felt like giving up into the 4th week thinking it wasn't going to work_ but I'm going to stick it out a little longer. If you're feeling discouraged don't give up yet! Sometimes we have to endure the bad before we are able to reach the benefits. I will update in a few weeks and share any progress. Hope any of this into helps!,F,22,4  weeks150 1X D,2/2/2011,Wellbutrin sr

Now many things irritate my bladder tht didn't before.  I can no longer drink coffee or alcohol.  It feels like I constantly have to urinate.  I had no idea this drug could do this much damage.

I could only sleep for 3 or 4 hours a night and it was extremely difficult for me to even be able to fall asleep for that long.  I was tired and wanted to sleep but my body wouldn't let me.  After a couple days of the insomnia I started feeling like I was high all the time.  I felt totally out_ had a ton of energy randomly throughout the day_ couldn't concentrate and had severe dry mouth.  These effects lasted for about a week and then slowly disappeared. The only lasting effect of the medication is decrease in appetite.,Medication helped a lot with my depression.

I started this for quiting smoking and found that it took all my anxiety away_ and my emotional outbursts were gone. I thought this was just part of my personality all these years and come to find out I was depressed. I can concentrate better_ think better_ less emotional_ focus alot better. And my moods stay even. My mate definitely can tell the difference. I would get mad at the stupidest things and was super sensitive. Now the things that bothered me seem to roll off of me. I also dont have racing thoughts anymore. I thought this was how life was supposed to be and wondered why everyone else seemed so happy and I didnt.

I feel great on this drug and I lost 5 lbs. the first week_ which makes me feel great all by itself.  In the past I've been on Elavil_ Celexa_ St. John's Wort and Lexapro; the latter of which made me gain 40 lbs. in 1 year.  I already feel more calm & stable_ plus I have a lot more energy.

It is significantly better with the side effects still got them but not nearly as bad. Thanks for the Canadian idea! Got to try that or go broke. Call me inpatient but when should it start to work?

Dr. recommended Wellbutrin and I have been on it for three weeks now (the first two weeks I stepped down from Zoloft). I am not sure if the symptoms I have are from finally not taking any Zoloft or if it is from the Wellbutrin. I hope it is the former_ because my sex drive has increased and my weight has already dropped without me even doing anything.

128, 4, Depression,The first week on 150md once a day I had some mild tremors and dry mouth.  The dosage was increased after seven days to 150 mg twice a day.  After a few days at this dosage I was suffering severe muscle tremors in my hands and the dry mouth was much worse.  By the end of the second week the tremors lessened and are gone now.  I still have very bad dry mouth and my eyes burn all the time like they are tired.  The only other issue I had was that I wet the bed a few times and I have never had a problem with that before. I am hoping that these effects also fade away with time.,Over all I am happy with this medication.  It is my first experience with an antidepressant so I was not sure what to expect.

I love beer but I haven't had the desire for one lately... could go with the lack of craving for food.  I guess the only negative side effect is how easily I get irritated.  I've always been moody but my road rage has been awful and I've been pretty snappy.

Don't seem to be as depressed...,Initially my friend told me I was depressed. I was so 'out' of it I didn't really know. I wanted to sleep all the time and was snappy. Cried at the drop of a hat. I work 3 jobs_ which makes me tired_ then found out I was Iron anemic. Between all of these_ I was a MESS. So the DR recommended WBSR and told me about the possibility of it helping with smoking [I have COPD] and weight loss [need to lose like 100 lbs ~sigh~] So_ I am really hoping and praying it works!,F,47,3  weeks150mg 2X D,8/19/2010Email,Wellbutrin sr
138, 4, Depression,Most side effects were strongest when I initially went on the drug; loss of appetite_ tremors_ twitches_ and severe strange rash on my abdomen.  Most of these subsided_ but the tremors and twitches are just less intense now.  The worst side effect is the extremely vivid dreams. I wake up most nights drenched in sweat as a result of the dreams.  The only reason I put up with it is because the Wellbutrin (I take XL) has helped my depression so much.,,F,20,1  years300 mg 1X D,8/17/2010,Wellbutrin sr
139, 5, ,Bad taste in my mouth. Weight loss which was a plus. Weighed 205 when I started and after 5 years I am 140. Dizzy_ foggy for about a month.,I was diagnoised with Pure OCD_ you know the kind that's all in the mind. Not like tics or rituals. I suffered from severe depression_ anxiety and the worse panic attacks ever. I was so distraught after being on numerous meds_ I'm sure most of you know what I'm talking about. Anyway_ I take 150mg 2x a day. Taking it at the same time everyday is very important. Before this drug I had no energy even in my perfect word of everything having to be perfect from my home_ kids_ husband_ entertaing_ etc. it completly exhausted me. I was dying inside. The depression was the worse and the anxiety and panic I truly believed that I was going to die. This did destroy a 14 year marriage. Thank God that my Doctor told me about this drug and started me on it. The side effects were so minumal and almost istantly I had relief. Within 1 week I was sleeping without being woken up with panic attacks. My anxiey still can bother me but I take kolopin 1mg for that and only when needed_ it only takes about 20 minutes to kick in. The best thing about this drug is I have not had one depressed day since about 6 weeks into taking this drug. And the greatest side effect ever is that my mind has finally shut up in the 46 years of my life. Well I must say one more excellent thing about this drug is that I have never been able to focus on anything_ I am so completly focused_ it's amazing!!! I would recommend that if you are prescribe this drug_ please report to your Dr. any side effects. Mine went away almos,F,46,5  years 2X D,8/6/2010Email,Wellbutrin sr
140, 4, severe mood swings_ depression,terribly motion sick_ nauseous_ trouble eating food_ awful headaches (which have persisted)_cotton mouth_ this weird unbalanced feeling- hard to describe- kind of feels like I'm on an uneven surface even when sitting_ short term memory problems_ weird and vivid dreams,For the first week or so I could barely ride in the car which has never been a problem for me and I would get unbearably nauseous but this has gone away for the most part. The headaches are still a problem- advil helps somewhat_ but it never goes fully away. The problems that concern me most are the uneven feeling that seems to encompass my whole body_ it feels like my whole body is tilting- it's very disorienting. I thought it was low blood sugar_ but this happens even after I eat. Has anyone experienced something like this? The short term memory loss is a little disconcerting as well- I'll be in the middle of a task or walking somewhere and then completely forget what I'm doing (goes with talking too). Also- can anyone answer some basic questions for me? Like is there really that big a difference between the generic Bupropion (which is what I'm taking) and the name brand? And what is the difference between XR and SR?,F,22,3  weeks150mg 2X D,8/5/2010Email,Wellbutrin sr

143, 5, Depression,When I was first prescribed Wellbutrin in college_ I was on 25 mg and experienced severe headaches.  To the point of when I took my Wellbutrin_ I had to accompany it with an Advil.  However_ after switching  my psych and finding a perfect combination of medication for myself - I do not experience any bad side effects; even with such a high dose (450mg/day).,I would highly recommend Wellbutrin SR to anyone with depression or depressive tendencies.  Most drugs have iffy side effects in the beginning as your body is getting used to the chemical balancing_ however_ after the initial period_ this drug works wonders.  The only thing - if I miss a dose_ my attitude becomes poor & I become very unpleasant.

Insomnia if I took the pills as instructed: two in morning_ two at night.  I started taking all of them before 3:00 PM and had no problems.,I take Bupropion but I think it's the same thing.  I am also very surprised because I have tried about 7 different AD drugs over the last 30 years_ the latest were Prozac which was awful_ then Cymbalta which had little to no effect like the others.  Wellbutrin was suggested to me by a friend_ so I asked my doctor for it thinking_ it can't hurt anything.  I'm very glad I did.

Looking forward to additional effects of the meds (elevated mood_ more energy)  I think it's important to note that I do not take any additional meds (with the exception of vitimans) which could be why the side effects have not been too bad.  However_ I have never been sensitive to stimulants and have always had really low or average blood pressure_ which also may contribute to the low side effects.

First down to 150 mg per day for about a month_ then none.  Been off it for about a month.  A bit rough getting off -- bad mood_ angry_ slept a lot_ almost no sex drive for a while_ weak erections.  All that passed and now feel absolutely great_ better than when on it.  Sex drive is back_ confidence and focus better then ever.  The problem is that I steadily gained 20 lbs. while on it (over about 2-3 years)_ and in the two months I've been off I've packed on 10+ lbs._ despite almost daily exercise (either weight lifting_ 1 hour cardio or 2 hours tennis - maybe 5-6 days per week).

HOWEVER--I was thin before I started taking the medicine and have had significant weight loss since starting it.  This would be fine if I weren't already a size 2--but now I get asked by friends and family if I have an eating disorder!  It's annoying.  I have to make sure to eat a certain amount of calories in a day to stay healthy.  I feel when my stomach is hungry_ but I really have no desire to eat. So make sure to keep up with the good calories even if eating feels like the last thing you want to do.  I recommend protein smoothies!,,F,23,3  months150mg 1X D,4/28/2010,Wellbutrin sr

164, 5, quit smoking,See comments,I had a heart attack in January_ 2004 and was advised to stop smoking.  I was 59 at the time and had smoked since I was 13.  I had tried to quit many times over the years with no success at at.  I had tried everything - acupuncture_ hypnosis_ cold turkey_ nicotine gum - everything.  In June_ 2004 I asked my doctor to prescribe Wellbutrin and let me see if it would help.  I smoked my last cig on Speptember 3 and have never had the slightest urge to smoke since.  I consider that miraculous!  It occurred to me at the time that I had not been at all depressed since I had begun taking the Wellbutrin.  I had suffered serious depression in fairly regular monthly cycles since I was a teen.  I told this to my doctor and we decided for me to continue the Wellbutrin as long as the results were acceptable.  I can honestly say that I have not had a depressed moment since I began taking the medicine in 2004!  I have now lived almost six years experiencing the life that most take for granted.  Only someone who has lived with depression would understand - my life has been changed beyond my ability to describe.  Never a day goes by that I don't think of the almost fifty years of hell I lived through.  I only wish everyone could have the results with Wellbutrin that I have experienced - truly miraculous!,M,65,6  years300 mg 1X D,4/9/2010,Wellbutrin sr

The depression isn't so bad and I can fight/reason with the negative thoughts more easily.However_ I feel it's harder for me to communicate verbally_ although that might be just general fatigue (I work continental shifts) or me going off Paxil (I'm currently at 4mg/day on a titrating schedule.)I would really advise anyone taking ANY antidepressant to also talk to a therapist/psychologist.  While depression has a bio-chemical basis_ it also has a mental basis.  It's important to learn how to think things through properly and deal with the negative thoughts when they come back.,M,36,5  days100 mg 1X D,3/28/2010Email,Wellbutrin sr

172, 1, Anxiety,Increased anxiety; Suicidal Thoughts; Uncontrollable Emotions: could not stop crying_ violent mood swings; Unbearable Insomnia ( I am posting this at 4am and haven't fallen asleep yet despite 2mg of Xanax).,I was on Celexa for 1 year and had to stop due to an marked increased in migraines. Switched to Pristiq which was great at first with the plus of weight loss_ but then I started getting depressed and gaining weight and having sexual side effects which I never had before. Tried Wellbutrin SR 150mg and feel like I'm going off the deep end. Doctor is tapering me off and are going to try Buspar_ but the side effects of that are not going much better.,F,39,6  days150 1X D,3/4/2010Email,Wellbutrin sr
173, 1, Depression,Gained almost 10lbs on this_ increased appetite_ no energy_ no libido whatsoever_ made me angry_ extreme anxiety_ awful drug for me.,I did not like this drug at all. It seems to have the opposite effect on me than most people. I was on Celexa which was working for me_ but made me sleepy. Doctor switched me to Wellbutrin to see if that would help. It did not. It increased my hunger_ I gained 10lbs (and I excercise 4 times a week)_ and absolutely killed my libido. Celexa did not do this for me. It also made me extremely agitated and angry_ both which are not normal for me. I was so tired all the time_ didn't want to do anything_ but cry and stay on the couch or in the bed. It killed my motivation. I was like a different person. I work full time_ so this was not good for me. I went back to the doctor_ who said I needed to increase my dosage from 150 mg to 300 mg daily. This only made me worse_ even more agitated_ sleepy_ angry_ hungry. Hell. Called doctor and and told him I wanted to go back on Celexa after 2 months of hell with Wellbutrin SR. All these side effects disappeared once I stopped taking this drug and went back to Celexa. Celexa made me sleepy_ but not to the point of being where I couldn't get out of bed or do anything. I got back to normal_ and lost the 10lbs quickly. Never changed my diet during the course of this drug. I eat low fat_ healthy_ and excercise. Won't ever touch this drug ever again.,F,28,2  months150 mg 1X D,3/3/2010,Wellbutrin sr

Feel optimistic about future.  I also have much more drive and energy to get what I want accomplished rather than just thinking about it. I feel happy almost all the time!  Weight loss has tapered off which was good because I was thin to begin with - I lost 3 lbs in the first two weeks which doesn't sound like much but considering I am 5'6"" and 115 lbs (now 112)_ I can't afford to lose an ounce.  My appetite is still non-existent_ but I just make myself eat at regular intervals and I do fine.  Best of all - I quit smoking!  The cravings are gone and even the smell of smoke makes me gag (husband still smokes - I'm gonna kick him outside to smoke when the winter is over).

Doc had told me to give it at least a month_ maybe 6 weeks. At the end of week 2_ I woke up one day feeling a little bit more like normal me....and the anger was gone. The next day was so much better! The only side effect now is the bad taste in my mouth. Food doesn't taste bad_ just my mouth. OH! And weight lose. Been on celexa for years with about 40lbs weight gain and inability to lose no matter how hard I worked at it. Now I'm down 16 lbs!! Weight lose was a lot the first few days and has leveled off to a lb every few days.  I really thought I was going to have to quit it after the first two weeks. I'm really glad I stuck it out.

My problem is weight gain_ about 7lbs and climbing and is not coming off with diet and exercise_ (I'm a dancer and cant afford this) and jaw clenching(which was tolerable). I'm switching to Wellbutrin SR 150mg(generic) so I can feel good without getting chunky. I'm doing 150 once a day for one week while still taking the Zoloft_ then quitting the Zoloft and supposed to be going up to 300mg of the Wellbutrin (150_ 2x daily) on week 2. This is my second day. I took meclazine (over the counter- I checked with the pharmacist who said it was ok) because the vomiting was aweful_ and ibuprophen for the headache. I'm still a little weak and shaky but better. I'm not completely sure if these are side effects or a 24hr bug that my room mates just got over. Both are equally possible_ but I dont have a fever so I'm leaning toward side effects_ but hoping it was just a bug. Guess I'll find out tomorrow and will up date later.

I did notice that for the first two weeks_ I felt angry.  I stopped taking for a few days and the anger went away.  I started the Burpropion again two days ago and I have no anger_ but I started with the headache.  I am hoping it will go away as I think it is helping otherwise.

182, 3, Anxiety,Increased energy_ immediate weight loss_ increased moodiness and short-temperedness,I began taking this a couple of years ago_ and took it for approx 1 year.  Within days I noticed a marked increase in energy_ and the weight (from 8+ years on Prozac)_ just melted off.  I was ecstatic_ and easily kept up the exercise as I had all those years of pushing myself.  Unfortunately_ though I didn't notice this as the cause_ my mood had also changed considerably. I lost my temper very easily with my daughter_ and our fighting and tiffs occurred almost daily. I couldn't understand it_ blaming it on other circumstances during that time. I got off of Wellbutrin_ and things went back to normal (normal moods_ control of temper_ also weight came right back on).I tried it again more recently (about 6 months ago)_ and could feel the moodiness creeping back by the second week_ so got off of it right away.  Was on 150mg both times.  Would love to try again_ if only for the energy and weight loss_ but worry about un-justified moodiness.  Will speak to my doctor about halving the dosage.,F,43,1  years,12/27/2009,Wellbutrin sr

Well after the first week these have all mostly subsided and I have doubled my dose of Wellbutrin SR to 150mg in the morning and at noon.,This medicine has changed my life!  I took Paxil for years then Lexapro for the better part of a decade until it seemed to quit working and I fell into a depression earlier this year.  I was put on Pristiq 8-months ago and while the depression went away so did my enjoyment of life.  I slept all the time and when I wasnt sleeping I was craving it.  I was unattached to my wife and two toddler daughters.  I missed so much.  I explained these issues to my family physician and he recommended that I tell my psychiatrist to try Wellbutrin.  I did and it has changed my life.  The first week was a bit rough with the side effects mentioned to the leftbut after hanging in there I am so happy I could burst.  I am enjoying my life now.  I come home from work with energy and enjoy spending time with my wife and family again.  I cannot put into words the blessing that this medicine has been to me.  I am now excited about what the future holds for me and am confident that I can handle it.  I used to feel so overwhelmed by everythingnow I feel in control.  I used to feel that I was just enduring life where now I feel that I am enjoying every minute of it.  If I had one recommendation to someone going through the side effects I had it would be to keep goingthere is light at the end of the tunnel.  I am so hopeful that this drug continues to help me as much as it does now without introducing any new side effects.

197, 3, Major Depression,Decreased appetite_ rambling and loosing my train of thought_ increased energy/anxiety_ vivid dreams,I've been taking it for about 10 days.  The first few days I felt the side effects the most_ but they didn't really bother me too much.  You just have to wait it out and they have mostly subsided now.  I took 150mg/once a day for 7 days and the past 3 days I've been taking 150mg/twice a day.  Don't really feel anything too badly adding the second pill.  I have trouble sleeping in general so I have to admit I've been taking Tylenol Sleep almost every night to ensure a good night's sleep and it definitely helps.  Overall_ I haven't felt a huge relief from depression yet_ but I will give it a month or six weeks to see how it really kicks in.  I hear this drug really works_ so I'll wait it out.  I can't wait to feel relief.  Otherwise_ my appetite is decreased but I eat anyway_ because I've have anorexic tendencies and know it can spiral if I don't eat a few times a day.  I definitely do not OVER eat_ and this drug helps with that.  I'm an average size girl - about 5'5 and 130 pounds.  As for my depression...it's bad.  I cry a lot and my emotions are right on the surface constantly.  It's so embarrasing and I've really isolated myself from friends and family to spare them the agony of my negativity.  I will post again in a month or so to see how the drug is really helping me then.  Good luck to all of you.,F,32,10  days,10/12/2009,Wellbutrin sr

I actually went home from work and I felt like ripping my skin off.. it's a wonder how I went to sleep.  They moved me back down and gradually got me to 300.  I definitely see an improvement with my depression. ..I do have dry mouth a lot. I excessively sweat when I exercise. Also some days I have extreme hand tremor and trouble concentrating others just a little and then some days none at all.  I do not know why. Some days that second dose also makes me irritable.,I am sticking with it because I am scared to try anything else. I have been on seroquil and that was a nightmare. I had uncontrollable midnight eating. I take depakote at night now and I think thats's helping.  I hear that alot of other antidepressants have sexual side effects and weight gain.

I'm taking 150 mgs twice a day and glad that most of my side effects have been experienced by others_ especially the mood swings and anger_ which I didn't have with regular non-SR Wellbutrin when I took it a few years ago. SR seems to hit a bit harder and last longer_ but it works faster. Other than the unusual angry moodiness I've had_ I feel fantastic. I wouldn't be able to get out of bed_ leave the house_ or function at work (assuming I went to work in the first place) without this. I just hope the negative side effects calm down soon_ especially the irritable angry outbursts which go away as fast as they come on. However_ so far the good outweigh the bad and I will continue to take it because believe it or not_ I've had worse. It was drugs like Cymbalta_ Seroquel_ Paxil_ Zoloft_ Geodon_ and Topamax which I took in the past for everything from PTSD_ anxiety_ bipolar disorder (that I don't have) and depression that didn't work and nearly killed me because they made things worse. I would say don't give up on this until a few weeks have passed_ and know that it may just be the drug causing the problems because it has been for me and knowing that makes it easier to deal with.,F,37,10  days,9/3/2009,Wellbutrin sr

207, 5, anger/depression_ compulsive eating,First month excessive energy/ couldn't sit still. Long term side effects are: need less sleep; loss of interest in food except when hungry; no longer eating compulsively or when stressed; occassional ringing in ears; increased sweating.  Secondary side effect of weight loss (30 lbs in 3 months).,I have always been moody and quick-tempered_ but last year I felt like a caged animal.  I wanted to run from life as a stay-at-home mom/ wife_ but I felt too angry and frustrated to even think about working part time just to get out. I had also gained nearly 90 lbs over the last several years and lost my self-esteem (which I never had trouble with). I no longer had a career and didn't recognize myself. Basically_ I had an identity crisis.  Eating became compulsive after my son would go to sleep and then I'd feel anger and despair over how gross I felt.  I would obsess about dieting_ but never start. I would go on rants often and then feel guilty.  I tried Lexapro but it made me even more evil.  I specifically asked my GP for Wellbutrin and he happily obliged.  Started at 150 for 7 days then 300/ day.  This is an amazing drug for those who need it.  I suspect eating had become an addiction (MH and addiction is common in my family) and Wellbutrin satisfied the need for dopamine in my brain (which is a factor in addiction).  Also_ I started to think of food like a normal person... only when I was hungry and I had energy to work out_ so I lost weight naturally.  The effect has leveled off_ and I do have some rough days_ but my head is clear enough to work it out.  I'm switching from generic budeprion sr to wellbutrin bupropion sr_ because I feel generic has noticeable differences from refill to refill_ and I've heard documented negative things about the generic maker.,F,33,6  months,8/1/2009,Wellbutrin sr

210, 5, ADD Depression,metallic taste in my mouth_ decreased hunger_ vivid dreams_ sometimes more than usual sleeplessness (but with my ADD I have always had some of that),I was on Wellbutrin SR (round purple) 150 mg X 2 daily.  1st time was in 2000 and I loved what it did for me. I lost 15 lbs without trying in the 1st 2-3 months.  My house was cleaner than it ever had been.  I don't remember why I went off it. I went back on last year but used WB XL once daily.  I used the name brand and most recently the generic by TEVA.  For some reason_ the WB XL name brand AND generic did nothing at all for me. I was using in combo with 50 mg Zoloft and then to 100 mg Zoloft which I am still on. The XL has none of the side effects or benefits like I experience with the WB SR. I felt like I was taking nothing at all.  On top of that_ I was lazier than ever not wanting to clean or get off the couch.  This could be attributed to the Zoloft but I need that for anxiety. The SR is more expensive than the XL generic for me_ but worth every penny.  I just switched back to the SR and have been on for only 2 days but I have already lost 2 pounds.  I also am experiencing the side effects I fondly remember.  I don't mind the funky taste in my mouth because my weight attributes greatly to my depression.  Overall Wellbutrin SR does WONDERS for me.,F,39,3  days,7/17/2009,Wellbutrin sr
211, 5, No energy or sex drive_ depression,Increase in energy_ crazy dreams_ headache for 1st 3 days_ return of libido!!!!!_ dry eyes_ and a stomach ache if I eat too much (although it has NOT made me want to eat less- wish it had).,"I have been complaining of constant fatigue and lack on ANY sex drive for years now and after being given an ultimatum by my hubby_ I went to see a doctor_ who did a whole slew of blood tests-all normal.  So he said maybe I'm depressed?  I didn't think so_ but what the heck_ I'll try anything.  He started me on Lexapro first.  I only took it 2 weeks and I was miserable.  I was soooooo tired_ it took all the effort I had to do anything but I could not sleep at night.  Horrible.  So then he switched me to 150 Wellbutrin SR_ and then to 300 (2x a day) on day 5.  WOW!  I feel amazing!  My husband and I have had sex TWICE in the last week (this is more than we've had in the last YEAR~ poor guy!)  I am actually horny and I have sensation ""down there"" again!  I feel genuinely happy again; smiling_ laughing and much more active.  I've been swimming in the pool with my son every day for the past few days.  I actually cleaned my house...I mean these are the simple things I could not find the energy to do before.  I will repost in a few months_ but so far this has been amazing.  Oh_ should add that I also smoke and this has not helped.  And there has been no decrease in weight or the urge to eat.  Although when I eat too much_ I get a stomach ache which never used to happen.",F,35,10  days,7/17/2009Email,Wellbutrin sr

213, 4, yes,None so far.,At this time I am 4 days into using this drug.  No side effects yet. Currently am taking 150mg in the morning and supposed to increase to 150mg twice a day. Noticing I am more focused.  The depression is gone.  Sleep very well_ but will see when the dosage is increased. Have not had my hunger decrease_ (can't wait for that to kick in) actually the food is tasting alot better.,F,53,4  days,7/8/2009,Wellbutrin sr
214, 4, stop smoking,vivid_ sad and scary dreams_ dry mouth_ strange taste in my mouth that makes cigarettes taste different in a way that makes me nauseous_ appetite is going away_ brief moment of confusion yesterday,Started taking 150/2x day but am thinking that I may back it off to just once a day. The dreams are the worst side effect of this drug for me. Horrible_ sad dreams and the images stick with me throughout my day. Happy about the decreased appetite_ makes it easier to make healthier food choices_ since I'm on this to stop smoking I appreciate that cigarettes are starting to taste horrible and make me nauseous on this drug. Am calmer and find myself getting alot of things done_ just methodically doing things and enjoying myself rather than racing around in a half panic. Feeling more centered and loving.,F,30,7  days,7/6/2009,Wellbutrin sr
215, 5, suicidal thoughts_ depression_ BPD,On standard dose of 150mg: tinitus which has been classical music_ felt hot_ sweated a lot once or twice_ had vivid dreams including weird sex dreams_ had a persistent bad headache_ anxiety and social phobia worsened_ increased hand tremors_ felt relentlessly happy & felt so different and almost cut off form the world I wondered about my identity. Worst of all was insomnia - 2 hours of sleep in 2 days. These lessened when I switched to a 50mg cut pill.,Ive had poss Borderline Personality Disorder and poss OCD. Wellbutrin has been great for me thank God. Suicidal thoughts have stopped - actually felt insulated from them. Significantly more stable mood_ felt happier warmer and friendlier. Needed less self-soothing. Felt no need  or interest in viewing porn - I'm actually not interested in it now which feels very healthy. Less obsessed with accomplishing things before bedtime. I found Dr Jay Cohen thinks that initial standard dosages of antidepressants have not been right for a lot of people and he recommends starting Wellbutrin at 50mg an increasing it if needed.(See:http://medicationsense.com/articles/jan_mar_04/antidepress_side_effects.html) I've always been a bit more sensitive than other people in various ways so I took the side effects as warning signs. I read that cutting could speed the release of Wellbutrin. This didn't bother me as I gather Wellbutrin used to be in non-slow release format. I actually saw speeding the release as an advantage as it could help me sleep better. I'm sticking with 50mg for now. To tackle the social phobia and OCD symptoms I'm going to ask my doctor if I can take (very low dose!) Zoloft as well as I have read Zoloft has zapped both of those for many people! Thank heaven we have these medicines.,M,31,4  days,6/29/2009,Wellbutrin sr
216, 5, Primarily anxiety / depression,Started out on 150mg/day - had trouble falling/staying asleep (1st week)_ easily distracted and spaced out a LOT (1st-4th week)_ lots of headaches (still experiencing)_ then came three weeks of intense suicidal thoughts (3rd-6th week). Survived that and doc upped dose to 200mg/day - suicidal thoughts finally went away_ appetite increased_ but now I have this bad/gross/disgusting taste in the back of my mouth/throat_ ALL THE TIME. I didn't want to quit smoking but I might have to because I have a feeling the bad taste is somehow caused by the Wellbutrin+cigarettes_ since the Wellbutrin also causes me to taste the cigarette smoke in my mouth in a way that I never have before. Bad_ bad_ bad taste. (Food tastes great though!),I noticed a decrease in my social anxiety during the first month_ but I believe that to be because I was too spaced out/distracted to be anxious in situations I normally would be. The anxiety has since returned_ but it's less predictable now and sometimes I manage an entire day without experiencing it at all. I believe that curing my anxiety (if that's even possible) is going to involve a lot more work than just popping these pills every day_ but I think the Wellbutrin has helped me on my way by practically curing my depression COMPLETELY. I can't explain it but I just don't think in the same patterns I used to_ I've stopped having mood swings (and my relationship has hugely improved as a result of that). My sex drive is pretty wild_ so no probs with that. I also have *extreme* bursts of energy and have begun exercising regularly again for the first time in 4 years! I can no longer go days without having the energy to take a shower - I shower every day and always feel motivated to take care of myself in ways I wasn't able to prior to taking this medication. Overall this medication has given me the energy/ability to do OTHER things that are helping me to get better_ like exercising and getting out and spending time with people again. I haven't lost any weight yet but I feel a million times better physically as well as mentally. Yay WB.,F,25,53  days,6/22/2009,Wellbutrin sr

Initially upon taking_ no desire for food or smoking.  Will continue to see if an increase of libido occurs.  I am happy with the results thus far.

Not sure its done much for my mood maybe getting alittle better everyday.,I noticed some changes in appetite the first week when I was on 150mg a day and when I went up to 150 2x a day my appetite was gone. I am little hungry in the morning and eat something light and then I may not even think of eating again that day. I am hoping that will last. I lost 2 lbs the first week on 150mg a day and 5 lbs the next week when I went up to 150 2X a day. 7lbs in 17 days without exercise or feeling starved is improving my depression!,F,40,17  days,5/17/2009Email,Wellbutrin sr

Longer lasting: anxious feelings returned_ panic attack_ weight stayed off.  I am no longer taking wellbutrin and I experienced very little withdrawal from the drug.  It was an easy one to quit.,While wellbutrin does not have many negative side effects_ I do not think wellbutrin helped my depression/anxiety much at all.  I sort of remained depressed and anxious for the two years while taking it.  I finally stopped because the anxiety eventually worsened.,F,30,2  years,5/11/2009,Wellbutrin sr

225, 5, Depression,While taking Budeprion SR 100 (Generic Wellbutrin SR made by Teva )I had a terrible headache all day and was extremely anxious and emotional. Even more so if I had any coffee.,I read on another site that some people weren't doing well with the generic Wellbutrin made by Teva.  I requested the name brand from my doctor_ Wellbutrin by Glaxo Smith Cline_ and I feel so much better.  My headache is barely there and my feeling of well being is great.  I am also calmer now.  This is the feeling I remember when I took Wellbutrin 5 years a go. I have learned to ask my doctor for the lowest strength of what ever she prescribes and slowly work my way up if needed.  I started with 75 mgs. for two weeks and I am now taking 100 mgs. of Wellbutrin SR once in the morning.  At this time I feel great and plan to just stay at this dosage for a long time and see if I can function normally.  So many doctor's seem to over medicate very quickly.  Control what goes into your body.  I recommend to do it extremely slow.  Take care and God bless.,F,51,4  days,4/28/2009,Wellbutrin sr

I didn't feel anything after the first dose_ but about 24 hours after the second dose I was standing in line at Subway last night and got kind of dizzy and just wanted to sleep. Also this morning I am having pretty strong menstrual-like cramps although I am not due for it for now. After reading about others having problems with periods on this drug I am going to stop taking it and try to something else. For the second dose to be this powerful just kind of scares me_ even if the symptoms will wear off. I just feel strange_ hard to put a finger on it. I also thought I was catching a cold but then read about flu-like symptoms too. I know it's still to early to determine how this drug will help me_ but after reading about the side effects and what I experienced I am going to ask my dr. if I can try something else. I did well on Celexa about 5 years ago before it just stopped working and will ask my doctor if I can try that again. Hopefully it will work now that it's been a while.,F,35,2  days,4/1/2009,Wellbutrin sr
228, 3, Depression/Anxiety,Tingling in hands_ increased sweating during sleep_ increased agitation_ euphoria_ brain fog_ seizure,I started taking generic buproprion sr to augment my therapy. My doctor said that it should work well for me. The first 3 days I took 150mg a day_ then I was instructed to take 300mg after that. The first day that I had taken the 300mg_ I had a panic attack followed by a partial seizure. My doctor then lowered my dose to 150mg once a day. Overall_ the meds worked well to bring me out of my funk. I found myself attending class more regularly and doing better in my school work. The euphoria that came with it was pretty nice :) However_ I find myself more agitated with people and worked up over silly things,M,22,7  days,3/31/2009,Wellbutrin sr

I tried suffering through the constant 24/7 headache in hopes that the depression would get better but it didn't_ I actually felt more depressed. I could not wait to get off this medication.  The insomnia was unbearable.  I could not leave my house for a full 2 weeks due to social anxiety which I did not have before taking this medication.  After going off this I went on Paxil...no luck just more side effects.  I am currently taking Cymbalta and am very happy with the results.  No side effects other than night sweats.,F,41,6  weeks,3/30/2009,Wellbutrin sr

Without it_ i lose focus. My mom was on it briefly and couldn't tolerate it_ unfortunately. Made her constipated.One drug I want to caution people about is CYMBALTA. It works great for depression_ but there are side effects you should look into before going on it_ AND IT'S A NIGHTMARE TO GET OFF OF!!!!!! Please look up comments on Cymbalta before considering it.

My doctor wants me to go up to 300 mgs daily_ but I tried it and its too much for me.  I didn't sleep at all those couple of nights that I took the increased dosage.  It's amazing how much better I feel.  I have loads of energy.  I feel really calm and focused and no longer spend days in the bed.  My sex drive is back (previously was taking zoloft and sex drive went away) and my husband is estastic.  No appetite at all!  Lost weight and its wierd how I have no interest in food at all.

233, 2, Depression/anxiety,After being on generic Wellbutrin SR for three days_ I thought I had gone completely off the deep end. My mind was racing. Looking at my beautiful wife and son made the depression worse because I knew I was so lucky to have them_ yet the anxiety was so bad after taking this I couldn't handle it. I ended up in the hospital for 5 days.,In a 6 month period I lost my dad_ job and my mom was diagnosed with cancer and of course had to go through the first round of holidays without my dad. My family doc put me on wellbutrin. Bad idea. From what my psych. said the wellbutrin increased dopamine_ which made the racing thoughts worse. This may be good for depression_ but HORRIBLE for anxiety. I really like my family doc_ but for mental health problems_ see a specialist.

I take 150 mg a day and am supposed to go up to 300 today but i'm nervous. I feel energized for about 3 hours after taking it then i feel sluggish the rest of the day. I don't think it's helped me with my ADHD yet. I guess i've got to give it more time. Oh_ I have no problem sleeping at night thankfully.

237, 5, depression,Took it for a year? with fantastic results.  Then started getting very sharp stabbing pains in my eyes.  And some light flashes. Very scary.  It seemed to get worse when the prescription was changed to time release. Went to opthalmologist who told me I had very dry eyes and suggested different eyedrops.  He didn't think the drug had any effect.  The eyes got worse.  I remembered that anti-depressants cause dry mouth_ (which I didn't have)_ so I stopped the Wellbutrin right then.  Within 2 days_ my eyes were much improved and totally fine in a couple more.  Even though I know it's not correct_ I saved the drug_ nd when I find that I am on the bottom_ I take a tiny amount(half a pill) for a few days to correct my imbalance.  The first time I did this_ I used it for a week?  and the eye stabs came back.  I guess I am just super sensitive.,This was a miracle drug for me.  It was about 4-5 years ago_ before they changed it to time release. It acted almost instantly_ within 2 -3 hours_ there was a marked difference.  Brought me out of a very low and panicky spot.  It made me more able to focus.  Had more energy.  I stopped being paranoid_ as in thinking other people didn't like me and was much more outgoing (valuable since I worked retail).  Joyful.  I could feel my mouth involuntarily pulling up into a smile.,F,63,1  years,2/21/2009,Wellbutrin sr

Nothing negative to say wish the weight loss effect would kick in.,Ive never been on an anti depressant before and used to take phentermine to control my weight. Then I heard Wellbutrin basically had the same results as far as weight loss goes and hey if it makes me happier im all for it. So far I have felt a definate increase in energy. And I would say my mood is somewhat inproved so far. One thing I can tell this drug really works for is smoking im not even trying to quit and it is definately hard to smoke so for those using it to quit smoking youll probably have good luck.

Also have lost about 22 lbs which is a good thing.  I stuck it out and almost all of the side effects went away.  I still don't feel compelled to eat but I'm fine with that.

Like this morning in the shower_ couldn't remember if I had washed my hair or yesterday on several occassions I was told things or handed something but couldn't remember. A few months ago while driving down the road I forgot what city I was in. This was a horrible feeling. Now this is a daily occurance for me and yes_ it concerns me greatly. This is a catch 22 for me.  The wellbutrin has helped me deal with life and enjoy it much more but now my short term memory failure is bother me greatly!

If I didn't_ I don't know if I could handle all the side effects such as increased anxiety and insomnia.  I hope I can update soon and say ""Wow_ it finally kicked in!""

246, 5, Depression,"Started at 100mg/day and worked up to 300mg/day (two 150mg tabs morning and night).  The initial dose and each increase separated by weeks resulted in a ""six expresso"" caffine like event_ couldn't sit still and lots of energy_ which was OK.  On going from 200 to 300 I had some tightness in the chest and a feeling that I couldn't catch my breath.  These side effects went away after a couple of weeks at the higher dose.  Increased sex drive.  Persistant rining in the ears but not real loud.",I've been on some other ADs and they had worse SEs.  Nice to have sex drive.  The ringing in the ears is the only persistant SE for me_ and it is a willing trade for the regained desire to live and do things.

On day 2 of taking Wellbutrin I had to admit myself into the hospital because I wanted to commit suicide.  I was very depressed and could not stop crying for 3 weeks_ the anxiety attached to all of this was huge and I had to take Ativan heavily for those first weeks.   There is still some anxiety_ but for the most part it is caused by my life situations.

I didn't even want to look at food_ let alone eat a bite. Towards the end of the second week_ I broke out in hives.

Well_ I still have dry mouth but it isn't horrendous like it was!  The first week or so I gained a whole lot of weight_ but I think it was water weight.  It dropped off very quickly beginning about the end of the second week and then the last two weeks I've been dropping weight really_ really fast.. and let me tell you_ I love food so I am not on any kind of a diet.  What happens to me with the fatigue is that I take it in the morning and it is fine_ but then I get really sleepy in the afternoon.

I then weaned of the Wellbutrin and my insomnia and constipation went away_ AS DID MY SEX DRIVE_ but the weight INCREASED FURTHER. Despite all this_ my depression and anxiety did not return_ but I am feeling irritable and annoyed.  I think all ADs should be avoided unless somebody is suicidal or very severely depressed.  Doctors prescribe these things much to quickly.  If depression/anxiety are bad then go on the stuff for 6 months to a year_ but combine with very_ very serious physical conditioning_ mental stimulation (i.e. something mentally challenging)_ and 'forced socializing'.

My mood improved while on Wellbutrin SR 150mg_ twice daily.  My wife noticed a marked improvement in my temperament.  I did have trouble remembering things before Wellbutrin_ so Im not sure if it got worse with use.  I was very tired all the time at work_ but with the WB and Adderall_ not the case!  After about 6 weeks_ I noticed the hives.  I eliminated everything new_ including the Wellbutrin and Adderall and changed my diet.  The hives subsided after about 2 weeks.  Started to reintroduce the Wellbutrin_ this time with a white pill as I had heard that the plum colored coating of my other generic might be a problem.  The hives came back after 4 days.

It needs to be noted that any antidepressant takes 6 to 8 weeks to work. I do remember feeling spacey or buzzed initially with those symptoms decreasing over time.

When I was 34_ a 5-week period of use of fluoxetine gave me premature presbyopia_ and although I promptly stopped taking fluoxetine_ the symptoms never went away (even after nearly 4 years of total cessation).Within 2 days of taking 150 mg per day of bupropion_ I started having intermittent problems with visual focus.  And within 10 total days of taking bupropion (7 days at 150 mg/day_ and 3 days at 300 mg/day)_ my presbyopia became severe_ such that I could not even focus on 24-point text in good lighting.  Fortunately_ upon ceasing bupropion immediately_ my vision seems to have returned to its former state of fluoxetine-induced presbyopia.With regard to my aforementioned sleep disturbances_ those symptoms improved immediately after I stopped taking bupropion.Had my vision remained as it was during my brief period of bupropi",M,38,10  days,11/3/2008,Wellbutrin sr

But when I moved up to 200mg_ I went into a full-blown mixed state 4 hours after taking the 200 mg dose.

269, 5, ADHD_ Balancing SSRI side-effects,Increased sex drive; improved mood.At higher doses: mania; mild anxiety.,Wellbutrin (150-300 mg) has helped tremendously countering the side-effects of Lexapro. Lexapro decreased my sex drive and made me apathetic_ which 150 mg definitely fixes. When I was diagnosed with ADHD my dosage was increased. The first day I took 300 mg I was completely manic! My friends asked if I was on drugs (which I guess technically I was)_ and I had a hard time getting to sleep with all of the excess energy. After continuing for several weeks I became very sexually aroused all the time_ which was more of a bonus than anything_ and the trouble getting to sleep subsided.I now take 150mg daily_ and occasionally 300mg if I have a lot of work to do or need something to boost my mood.I've taken a one-week holiday from this drug_ and experienced no withdrawal symptoms.,M,20,7  months,10/22/2008,Wellbutrin sr

It made my OCD calm down. I didn't stress over little things and it didn't make me gain any weight like many of the other anti-depression drugs. I recently stopped taking it because it made me feel depressed and I think my body just got used to it after 6 months. I would recomend it to people_ its a very mild drug and I'm not having any withdrawls.,F,23,6  months,10/15/2008,Wellbutrin sr

Im starting to get very good grades when before I never did (and I tried very hard before)- I think that possibly I had some sort of learning disability that got fixed by this drug.... other side effects: I started to really care abt school_ and became faster in writing tests and doing my work.. but the only thing is now im trying to add Cymbalta to it_ and I think that they work well_ but not sure exactly abt the result yet of their interaction... if anyone else has those kind of effects plse e-mail me monikamtb@hotmail.com,,F,24,1  days,10/13/2008Email,Wellbutrin sr

I was a vibrant young women and am now on disability and have significant muscle loss that Dr.'s can't explain as well as multiple sclerosis symptoms with a normal mri. The Dr.'s are baffled.

I had none of the severe side effects I've read on this post - probably because of the ease with which I went into it.  An Army Ranger childhood friend was killed in Afghanistan and I just broke down.  Could not even get out of bed or shower.  The day after I started this med_ I was able to go to work and it got better and better from there.  Now_ I can even do things I couldn't before the depression - like watch the doc give me a shot.  Only problems for me are some headaches (not migraines)_ very shaky hands_ and I'm pretty jumpy.  If I drink_ I get nauseous_ so I just cut that out.  Unfortunately_ I have not lost any weight like some others.  The only reason this got a 4 instead of the 5 is because of the shaky hands.

I used to have an amazing memory to where I could recall anything. Now I have no focus and I my short term memory is nonexistent. It is quite scary. I couldn't even remember my niece's name the other day. I expressed concern to my doctor and he has prescribed Straterra to try to get my focus back on track.  We'll see if it helps.

It took longer than my doctor told me though. She said to quit after the second week but I failed at that time. I was able to quit effortlessly after being on for 4 months. I asked to keep taking the drug permanently because of how well it has eliminated my depression and irritability. I feel very ""content"" all the time  while taking it_ but not manic or giddy _ I have more patience_ and am more social in general. I still have my moments of being pissed off  but it lasts only for minutes now instead of all day. I have completely stopped my compulsive_ self-perpetuating negativity and that feels great. I still reason normally and do not take excessive risks_ in other words it doesn't feel like an artificial ""high""_ just a feeling of contentment.The side effects are mild or even desirable (increased libido_decreased appetite).

That's really the only big thing I noticd. I haven't experienced any severe side effects. A week after the first month on this medication_ I felt great. I felt so happy and energized. I just had a better outlook on life altogether. However_ the week after that I felt very down and my anger/mood swings returned. Also_ I was more irritable than ever. I also find it very difficult to get out of bed in the morning now.

294, 5, depression,stiff neck at first_ anxiety at first_ insomnia if taken too late in the day_ increased libido,Of all the antidepressants I have tried (most of them) this one has been the most beneficial with the least side effects.  One of the things I will never understand is why doctors continually try to start severely depressed and panicky/anxiety ridden patients on only an antidepressant instead of giving them an antianxiety drug at the the same time.  It makes no sense to me.  The drugs are such a shock to your system and my system would 100% of the time react with panic.  I can't tell you how hard it is to get yourself to take a drug that you know is going to put you in the panic state.  As a psych nurse_ I had to try to convince patients to take something that we both knew was going to put them through the wringer for the next several weeks until their body either got used to the drug or they just couldn't stand it any more and quit.  It is cruel and counter-therapeutic.  I suspect success rates would quadruple if you dealt with the anxiety/panic factor up front and then reduced and di,F,55,3  years,6/30/2008,Wellbutrin sr

I thought I had early symptoms of Parkinson's b/c my hands shake. I kept chalking it up to the Wellbutrin_ and thankfully I am right.

My doctor initially put me on 300mg_ and I felt like a coke addict_ horrible bags under my eyes_ no appetite_ constantly manic_ insomnia_ thoughts racing so fast_ slurred speech_ it was hell! He took it down to 150mg and that was perfect. My Bipolar II is mild_ and this medicine has been a Godsend in taming the symptoms. I haven't met one person who has had anything positive to say about this drug; my sister just got on it for depression/anxiety and she hates it_ she says it's not working. But_ everyone is different.

Seemed to notice joint pain too.,After being off for 2 months I think I am going to try it again and only take 150 once a day and really try and stick with it.

The 5 rating is because I never knew I could feel this good.  I just feel happy and good about myself.

It helped me tremendously!!  Please PLEASE tough out the first few months of side effects.  It takes at least 2-3 months for your body to get used to the new drug in your system.

Some of them passed but the ones that remained: drowsiness_ inability to lose weight even when exercising_ ZERO libido_ ZERO orgasm. So my doctor put me on Wellbutrin SR (150 mg 2x daily). I was a bit nervous starting...I was anticipating a bunch of horrible side effects in the beginning like I had with Zoloft. Surprise_ surprise...NONE! Except really good ones...I'll continue in next section...,"WOW! Libido is at an all time high. My husband is a VERY happy man! I noticed a difference in my sex drive almost immediately. My orgasms are the best I've ever had & frequent (5 times last night alone!) Also_ decrease in appetite which has caused me to shed some pounds. Very vivid dreams....many erotic...not such a bad thing. I also had a ""first"" while taking this drug. I actually had an orgasm IN MY SLEEP during one of my erotic dreams. I am a female & didn't even know this was possible! It has helped 100% with my anxiety as well. I am calmer_ happier and more ""normal."" On Zoloft_ I had a very flat affect...calm but very unemotional for months. Wellbutrin_ for me_ has been a wonder drug. I know it is not for everyone but if it does work for you...LOOK OUT...your peaked sex drive will shock you (& your partner!) I feel like a sex kitten again :)",F,39,4  months,4/29/2008,Wellbutrin sr

The first and a little into the second week I cheated a couple times and smoked a drag or two. But now I can honestly say I hate even smelling cigarette smoke or seeing someone smoke.

Wellbutrin is the first one that actually worked for me.  The side effect subsided after a month.  I've been on it for about 4 years now and am still happy with the results.  I actually am planning to come off of it soon simply because I don't think I need it anymore.  I've learned to deal with panic attacks on my own at this point.

I noticed on more than a few occasions that I was losing entire days. I would go to school in the morning and not be aware of anything else until I got home.  While I discussed these issues with my doctor he thought that it had more to do with a lack of sleep.  Which I also decided must have been caused by the medication because I had never had that problem before.  A few days before I stopped taking it I remembered leaving the school building.  The rest of this story was a blank until about a year ago when it came back to me in a flashback.  When I went to get on the bus I had an intense hallucination which made me think that the bus had turned into a monster. I apparently refused to board the bus and froze in place about 10 feet from the door. The secretary came and ushered me back to the school building where she called my mom.,Please consult your doctor about ALL possible symptoms!

(Most side effects only for the first 2 weeks.),Wonderful if you want to quit smoking!  Will make you want to vomit at the scent of smoke_ and possibly even the sight of a cigarette.  If you can handle the initial negative side effecs that last approximately 2 weeks or so_ this drug can prove quite beneficial for both quitting smoking and depression.  I also lost 26 pounds as well_ although it was mostly because Wellbutrin SR took away my appetite almost completely.  I recommend eating with every dose_ or you'll become extremely faint.  All I have to say is that two weeks of negative side effects from this medication definitely beats lung or throat cancer anyday.  If I had severe depression_ I'd take something else though.  This seems to be a lighter anti-depressant.  No sexual side effects from this one either.  Good luck to all!,F,24,2  years,2/2/2008,Wellbutrin sr

I felt better_ didn't even have too many side effects expect the bad taste in mouth. 2 week_ even better. I found some things in me that ya would have were lost forever. I cried_ not only did I cry_I felt every emotion. On celexa I couldn't that. This med work great if the side effects don't kill you first.

Nausea for the first 1-2 weeks.,I got a horrible rash in the beginning_ after 2 months its just now starting to clear up. That was the only real negative side effect that bothered me. I have tried nearly ALL antidepressants and could not handle them_ due their bad effects on me. This is the FIRST and ONLY antidepressant medication that actually worked for me_ and didn't have a sever negative effect on me. I have been feeling a lot more motivated and a lot happier since taking Wellbutrin. I also find that it helps me not dwell on things and to not hold grudges. I would suggest this medication to people who cannot handle SSRI's.,F,23,2  months,1/22/2008Email,Wellbutrin sr

I tried anti-depressants for no more than a month before I stopped. However_ recently I had a nervous breakdown_ so I decided I'd try again.A year or so ago_ I tried Paxil once_ the intensity of the physical side effects were ridiculous_ so I stopped after 2 days. Also_ I tried Lexapro for a month_ I felt amazing but the sexual side effects were not acceptable to me at all.Now I have started Wellbutrin_ and after just a few days this stuff is kinda crazy.

This is the 3'rd day and although I am no longer depressed_ I just really feel bumbed out_ irritable and super sensitive today. Plus_ I went limp and it took forever to get off when I masturbated. I thought this stuff was supposed to make you super horny???. Anyway_ the jury is out right now and it's still too early to tell if this is going to help me like I had hoped.,I am taking 75mg of Wellbutrin XL once a day for severe alcohol-withdrawal induced deppression.

Switched to generic Wellbutrin SR taking 150mg once in the morning for 6 weeks now. After couple of days noticed a big change in mood since I was able once again to get excited about things. Also the first couple of days sex drive went through the roof together with a total increase in body sensation. This has somehow more normalized after a couple of weeks now. Depression almost completely went away with just very few occasional little spells of feeling depressed. Bottom line is that this is definitely a great drug that brought me back to life!,M,39,6  weeks,1/12/2008,Wellbutrin sr

Before taking it I was functional & not even that depressed or anxious but Wellbutrin caused extreme anxiety for me_ coupled with DEBILITATING PANIC ATTACKS_ bizarre waking dreams_ auditory hallucinations_ terrible insomnia_ violent_ raging outbursts.

DO NOT! DO NOT TAKE WELLBUTRIN IF YOU ARE PRONE TO PANIC ATTACKS OR ANXIETY!!!I posted about Wellbutrin back on 10/29/2006_ my comments begin with: ""I am a small woman (5'4""-104 lbs) & 150 mg/day definitely was too much for me.."" & then I mentioned how I felt I might have to admit myself to the hospital..WELL it's a over a year later & yes_ I ended up in the psych ward from the panic attacks caused by taking Wellbutrin for just ONE MONTH. The panicky feeling & rage continued for WEEKS after I discontinued the Wellbutrin until I just couldn't stand it any loner & admitted myself to the hosptal because of panic attacks & I was worried I might try to physically hurt someone in a rage.Pretty funny story: the last straw for me was one morning I woke up around 5am & 'Saved by the Bell' was on the TV.

When I started_ my depression was mild.  Now it's very severe. Before Wellbutrin_  I was on lamictal_ but had severe memory problems and quit.  Has anyone else waited >2 weeks for this to kick-in?  I thought it was fast-acting? Has anyone had problems with depression worsening w/ Wellbutrin? Thanks,M,49,12  days,8/9/2007Email,Wellbutrin sr
385, 4, yes,Anxiety at night_ especially after being asleep for a few hours.  I wake up and can't get back to sleep b/c of racing thoughts; chest pain; really jittery a few hours after taking it; irritable; constipation.  None of these are horrible except for the waking up at night.,My depression is on the milder end of the scale.  I was fine the first week when I was on 150mg/day.  I upped my dose on Monday to 300mg/day and started noticing the side effects.  I go back to see my Dr in a few weeks for a follow-up_ if things aren't better by then I'll see if there's a different dosing.  Overall_ my mood does feel better_ and if the side effects lessen_ I'll definitely stay on this for awhile.,F,22,10  days,8/8/2007,Wellbutrin sr
386, 3, Depression / ADD,Increased energy_ insomnia_ headache (subsided)_ vivid dreams_ inability to take a deep breath_ big red itchy welts (not fun)_ decreased appetite (excellent),From the first day I took this medicine I could finally focus in school (I'm a college student in my third year). Soon_ the side effects started. I began to have a headache and neckache that were both fairly severe_ but they subsided after about one week. The big itchy red welts I had attributed to bug bites_ but I read it elsewhere on this page! Crazy. The biggest problem is trouble breathing; I may switch to provigil or adderall if possible because I have asthma as well. Please email lori (at) k9care (dot) com if you have experienced the trouble breathing and could let me know if it will subside! I would love to continue taking the drug because of the energy.,F,21,2  weeks,8/1/2007,Wellbutrin sr
387, 4, mild depression,sleeplessness (although not bad; helped me get out of bed in the morning_ but sometimes VERY early). for the first week woke up in the middle of the night sometimes. also had very vivid dreams.  loss of appetite_ increased sex drive. ANXIETY though - mostly in my stomach_ but not paralyzing anxiety_ like I used to have.,I feel a difference_ just more motivated and happier. A little giddy sometimes. The dreams I've just started writing down because they're realistically crazy yet so vivid - were scary at first_ now I'm used to them. Don't know if the weight loss (5 lb in 3 wks) is related to increased motivation to exercise or the drug itself_ but my appetite is generally gone_ too (this is okay). I can't drink coffee like I used to because of the anxiety_ but I was also prescribed klonopin for when the anxiety hits me hard - this works.,F,30,3  weeks,7/29/2007,Wellbutrin sr
388, 4, Depression/Anxiety,Nausea_ insomnia_ a little jittery,Wellbutrin has helped me considerably.  Everyday tasks aren't so overwhelming.  My husband has noticed a dramatic increase in my energy levels.  I'm working out everyday_ because I want to_ not because I have to.  I've lost 9 pounds due to nausea and exercise.  I'm pretty happy with it.  By the way_ the exercise actually helps to curb the nausea...go figure.,F,27,2  weeks,7/26/2007Email,Wellbutrin sr

390, 5, PMDD_ mood swings_ depression,Side effects lasted less than a week and were tolerable. This included dizziness_ tunnel vision and a rash that started on my ankles and worked up my legs.,This has been a wonderful drug for me. I have PMDD (which means super PMS that makes me temporarily insane and horrible to be around) and a history of depression. This drug has helped stabilize my moods to where I don't get overwhelming anxiety or depression. I started off on 150 mg for 6 weeks and felt no better so went up to 300 mg which is where I am now.,F,29,8  months,7/19/2007,Wellbutrin sr
391, 4, depression,You can't just miss a dose. I turned into the biggest asshole in the world and i think if someone pissed me off i would flip out on them_ and normally I'm a really calm person. SEX DRIVE INCREASE! awesome side effect. Energy_ but hard time waking up. decreased appetite_ which i hate since i have a hard time gaining weight (but i'm a guy and want to be muscular_ not skinny). hard to sleep_ oh well though since I always had trouble sleeping.,I really enjoy wellbutrin. It's helped me out for sure. Energy is up_ libido increase_ energy increase. I smoked pot almost everyday and really don't want to because i feel like it will take away from my energy and well-being. I don't have the urge to smoke anymore. life seems almost easier and things don't get to me anymore. I used to stress about doing some things_ but now i just do it without stressing. great drug_ just don't stop or miss a dose or you might have some real mood issues such as in my case. I can't just miss a dose since I now know that it will put me in such a bad mood that I'm afraid I might just go off on someone that is agitating me.,M,21,3  weeks,7/19/2007,Wellbutrin sr
392, 4, Counter Effexor side effects (OCD),increased sex drive (not complaining)_ some initial weight loss (again_ no complaints here)_ possibly increased my acne - it's difficult to know if it is the cause but I do break out more now.  The first week or so I felt agitated_ anxious and couldn't sleep but those effects wore off by the end of 2 weeks.,I have taken Wellbutrin alone and in conjunction with Effexor.  It did help counter some of the side effects of effexor.  While taking it alone_ it definitely improved my mood and I had virtually no side effects (other than the possible increase in acne).  Wellbutrin alone does not help my OCD very much though.  It helps it slightly_ and also helps the depression that goes along with it_ but Wellbutrin alone is not enough to give me the full relief I need.  I highly recommend it though and I also encourage people to stick it out for a few weeks because the way I felt when I started it was totally different than how I felt after being on it for a few weeks.,F,33,4  years,7/18/2007,Wellbutrin sr
393, 5, Adult ADD/Depression,None,For one year I sat and read this website until I was so scared I didn't take it. How foolish I was. I worked myself up for nothing. Wellbutrin has opened my eyes and has lifted the weight off my shoulders. I am level now and can concentrate. I lost a few pounds thus far. People just take the pill. I been on Lexapro and I was in a fog for days. Not so with Wellbutrin.,M,47,2  weeks,7/13/2007Email,Wellbutrin sr
394, 1, Severe depression,At first I was so down that I was happy for any pill to do ANYTHING to help me. But I noticed after a few weeks that I was still depressed_ although less so. I figured I'd wait a few more months. Well after 8 months of taking it_ I can tell you now that I have never been so angry and raging in all my life. I thought it was me. I did not think it was the pill. I nearly lost my relationship as a result of the Wellbutrin's effect on me. After doing research and speaking to my doctor_ I found out that Wellbutrin is known to cause irritability and in some cases intense feelings of anger and extreme RAGE. I mean the kind of RAGE where you feel like something has totally gripped you during the time you're raging. I now am off Wellbutrin and am on Lexapro. I would not suggest Wellbutrin if you're prone to any kind of irritability. I also could not sleep b/c of the medicine. For months now my sleep has been interrupted and it was very hard getting to sleep. Doctors won't tell you about the RAGI,If you want to quit smoking_ then it's a good fix for that but not for really severe depression. I took Wellbutrin in  two separate time periods and the RAGING and crying fits happened all the time.,F,43,8  months,7/11/2007,Wellbutrin sr
395, 4, Adjustment disorder,Jaw clenching_ insomnia.,I too had racing thoughts at night_ couldn't sleep but then I started taking my doses differently. I took one at 7 in the morning and one at 3 in the afternoon. I am sleeping so well at night now_ no more insomnia or racing thoughts. As far as the jaw clenching_ I'm hoping that it goes away as I adjust to the medication_ but if not the benefits definitely outweight the side effect.,F,31,14  days,7/9/2007,Wellbutrin sr

397, 2, Mild depression_ anxiety,Insomnia_ weight gain_ weird dreams_ no increased libido and lashed out at my husband more frequently.Loss of patience increased.,I switched from Paxil to Wellbutrin when I started having terrifying dreams. The dreams changed to not so freightening but still very vivid. I have gained 10 lbs and do nothing different. I also would have spurts of energy and then be very tired. Very hard to get to sleep at night and I took the 120 mg first thing in the morning. I have been off of it for 4 days now and so far so good. I'll see if my anxiety level goes up. Was on Buspar for 10 years (30 mg/day) worked really well but hated taking it 3 times a day. So of the three (Buspar_ Paxil_ Wellbutrin) Paxil worked the best if it weren't for the dreams (and the coming off of it),F,50,6  months,7/2/2007,Wellbutrin sr
398, 5, bipolar depression_ weight control,The side effects have been minimal_ increased thirst and insomnia are about it_ and they have not been troublesome at all.When I first started Wellbutrin my weight dropped 10 pounds in 2 weeks_ and 40 pounds in a year to an ideal 190 (at 6').  Seroquel caused weight gain was eliminated recently with the help of Wellbutrin_ dropping 20 pounds in 3 months_ back to 200. Bench press_ lat pull downs etc went up 20 pounds instantly_ and after a year I was able to do 10 chin ups in one set.  The increase in motivation_ willpower and energy level are tremendous_ everything is so easy to do that I have to force myself to stop and relax.  No negative sexual side effects_ if anything it helps.,This is the only medication I have taken that has helped and had tolerable side effects.  When I was taking Seroquel and Wellbutrin_ it was like the wellbutrin wasn't even there.  The loss of appetite control on Seroquel completely overpowered Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin alone has improved self confidence and depression is gone.  Thinking skills_ the quality of my work_ creativity and the ability to stick to a task improved dramatically and the positive effects have continued for 9 years.  Although Wellbutrin pushed me into mania_ I can now recognize the symptoms and adjust to avoid full blown mania.  Serocrap masked the manic symptoms until I exploded.  I highly reccomend Wellbutrin to anyone without anorexia.,M,47,9  years,6/28/2007,Wellbutrin sr
399, 4, Depression,"Didn't need as much sleep_ insomnia if I took it near bedtime.  More energy and ambition_ mild ""butterflies"" feeling in pit of stomach",Took generic buproprion SR_ 100 mg in morning_ 50 mg in early afternoon.  Helped me deal with longstanding but low-level_ almost subclinical_ depression.  Started it when going through a super-nasty divorce where I was the target.  It helped me have the drive and energy to not just function in my very demanding job_ but to excel in it. Gradually the benefits seemed to wear off_ and after about 18 months I didn't notice any effects one way or the other.  At 24 months I stopped cold turkey.  No side effects for me when quitting; your mileage may vary.  Great thing about Wellbutrin/Buproprion is that there were NO sexual side effects for me_ like with SSRI's. One long weekend my fiance and I were intimate over a dozen times_ though I had some male help from Cialis on that one.I took my Wellbutrin in morning and afternoon_ because if I took it in the evening I would have trouble getting to sleep.,M,43,2  years,6/26/2007Email,Wellbutrin sr

No dreams though...I haven't experienced much weight loss. Loss of appetite for the first 2 weeks and then that came back (unfortunately!),I was going to give up on this drug so my doctor switched me to Wellbuturin Xl which is 300 mg but is extended release capsules..Side effects all went away.

There did come a time where my dose became too strong_ as I felt a bit ill_ hyper-energy and headaches were starting....my doc lowered the dose at my request and there's been absolutely no problems since. To anyone taking this_ just be careful in stopping it...I was told it's not the type of drug that causes any type of withdrawl problems_ but once I did stop it for 2 weeks and felt almost suicidal and *horrible* beyond description. Possibly it did me so much good that my regressing into an old me is what caused those feelings....but I think it was the abrupt stopping of the drug. There are days I do not take it_ like if we are going to have a few drinks_ as they warn of seizure risks_ but I have never had that happen to me.

I was irritable and crying every single day. My MD put me on Wellbutrin and Xanax. I take the Xanax in the evening (around 6pm).

To those just starting Wellbutrin_ it can take a few months (1-2 for me) for the side effects to settle.  For me_ I had horrible restless leg syndrome and couldn't sleep well for the first 2-3 weeks. Like others_ though_ I have also noticed vivid dreams coming back.  One important piece of advice: you'll want to dramatically reduce or eliminate caffeine intake.

(The only reason I rated it a 4 was because some of these side effects)Pros: Increased energy_ better concentration_ increased confidence (can speak my mind anywhere anytime)_ increased libido_ alcohol suppression_ and most importantly no depression episodes since I started.,I've been taking Bupropion SR 100mg once a day for about a week and yea I've experienced a lot of side effects_ but it has already changed my life. I'm more ambitious and energized than before and feel like I can handle any situation with minimal anxiety. I also feel a boost in my mood throughout the day_ I'm laughing and joking a lot more than I used too. A lot of things that I used to worry about don't really stress me out anymore. In addition to all this the added bonus of an increased libido is the icing on the cake. I was on prozac for 2 years and didn't see the types of results I'm experiencing with Wellbutrin after only a week. I'm really looking forward to reaping the full benefits of the drug after about a month_ and hopefully some of the side effects will subside by then. I definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about trying anti-depressants.,M,22,8  days,5/15/2007,Wellbutrin sr

Then around 7pm I started to get a bad headache.  The headache kept getting worse as time went by and no headache medicine was worrking.

Recently_ I twitch while falling asleep and have been having extremely vivid dreams.  They're not usually bad dreams_ but they are oddly disturbing.  Because I only drink occasionally_ my doctor did not tell me to not drink_ and after doing some research I decided it would be okay to drink a little bit.

I also have blurred night vision.,I started on this drug after a nervous breakdown. The first two weeks I felt like I was taking a caffine pill twice a day. Then the sensation slowly evened out. I began to feel better and happier_ but my anxiety did not lessen. I made changes in my life to create a positive atmosphere. After doing so_ I decided to slowly wean off the drug after being on it for a year. I called my doctor and he said that I could just start taking half my dosage (150 instead of 300) and then quit. After doing so I went into a deep depression_ I also gained almost 10 lbs in a matter of three weeks. I had no other choice but to get back on the drug. I slowly lost the weight again_ but I didn't feel much better otherwise. I have decided to stay on the drug to maintain my weight and for fear of the side effects of getting of this drug.

First week dropped 4lbs and lost total of 6lbs that month.  No food cravings!,My doctor put me on bupropion SR_ 150mg daily as I was depressed about not being able to lose any weight.

With Wellbutrin SR_ I feel myself but even better. Less depression_ can handle life better. Can get out of bed_ make goals and actually reach them. My plan is to be on this med for 1 year while I make life changes. I am doing the footwork for spiritual/emotional growth and exercising and eating right. None of which I could accomplish without getting this cloud lifted. It has enhanced my sex life. I've lost 20 pounds since I started and I believe the lack of appetite has helped with eating less.

Weight loss: went from 169 lbs. to 165 in 1 week while maintaining a normal diet and normal appetite.  I've maintained approx. 170 pounds for the last four years so 165 is not typical for me.  Though not a listed side affect I did experience drowsiness during the middle of some days_ which is not typical for me (when not medicated).  I believe the weightloss is due to an increase in physical exertion and therefore can produce a fat burning effect within the body. Increased metabolism.,I've been taking Wellbutrin SR (75mg) twice a day (total of 150mg/day) for 13 days now and have experienced mixed effects.  For the first 3 days I felt a high amount of energy from 6 am to 11 pm.  The feeling was similar to that of caffeine but without the jitters and without the crash or come down.  I was talking a lot but in a good way.  It was a great feeling_ one that I'd like to feel all day every day.  On the 4th day I felt drowsy all day long and did not have that same energy as the first 3 days.  Since then I have only felt that energy on two or three occasions and am still experiencing my feelings of depression.  I'm hoping that the energetic feeling will be consistent once the medication saturates my system (2-4 weeks?).  I believe I will eventually increase my dose and move to Wellbutrin XL.

On day 7 I turned my head and along with the dizziness I actually experienced tingling in my tongue and fingers; that's when I decided I definitely had to stop taking this. I was scared it was causing my brain to swell_ or something else along those lines! Days 6 and 7 I was also depressed and couldn't stop crying. I didn't want to see anyone and didn't feel like leaving my bed or even getting dressed.

465, 5, depression_ anxiety,a common swelling of jaw leading to biting inside of mouth (ouch!)_ slight agitation_ dry eyes_ increased urination_ occasional insomnia if i also have caffeine.Many of the side effects that I had when I first took wellbutrin SR (appetite reduction_ shaky hands_ intensely dry eyes_ dry mouth_ stomach upset_ skin problems) were completely 100% GONE suddenly after 12 months of taking this med. I don't quite know why it took so long to adjust_ but there are reports of side effects fading after many months_ so don't ever rule that out. Also_ we all have to always consider that it might be the illness that is giving us  various side effects (intense stress does crazy things to the body). Often we just need a lot of time to let our bodies adjust_ and we may have to make other adjustments ourselves_ such as changing diet_ exercise_ etc.,I have more or less chronic anxiety_ but it comes with yearly or so bouts of mild-moderate depression. 100SR is enough to eliminate the depression as well as more severe feelings of anxiety within a week or two. I also get panic attacks periodically_ and believe it or not_ wellbutrin SR completely eliminates these_ which proves that you don't necessarily need a sedating med or SSRI to manage panic problems.I highly recommend to try to start w/ a LOW DOSE at first_ such as 100 SR ONCE a day_ not twice_ and then move up to 150 SR once a day if needed. Some of the more common side FX on this board go away with reduced dose. For me_ even the difference between 1 x per day or 100 SR and 150 SR is a very big difference & I often cannot tolerate the 150 SRs. I have also tried the XL version_ which has much fewer side FX_ but the extended release keeps me up nights_ so that is out for now.I have taken this med on an off for the last 8 years and it is very helpful.

Went off_ for more than year.  Recently started again to get off chewing Nicorette and immediately noticed my hair dry and beginning to fall out again.

On the plus side_ I concentrated and worked way better than without it.  On the minus side_ I couldn't sleep without a benzodiazepine_ and had problems with my heart:  rapid pulse_ chest pain_ and weird heart sensations.  Have your heart checked with an echocardiogram (not EKG which is junk) before starting this medication.  If your heart_ like mine_ isn't strong_ don't take it because it will mess up your heart.  Also start at the lowest dosage and once a day only_ and increase_ if need be_ after 1-2 weeks.,M,43,2  weeks,3/24/2007,Wellbutrin sr

But Wellbutrin SR still isn't as bad as Zoloft or Lexapro. It's awesome to still have a sex drive. I am supposed to be on 300mg a day but I am going to stick with 150mg for a few days. When I took 300mg I wanted to yell at everyone and kill my husbend. Not good. I have had one small panic attack since I started on Wellbutrin but still not sure if it's worth the rage Wellbutrin causes.

I used to be overly emotional to where I was sometimes impossible to talk to or be around_ now I feel like a normal person.  I don't feel crazy anymore.  This is the first drug that I've taken that has actually helped me with my depression.  I think back on how I used to be and it seems wierd to think how depressed I was.

Its almost been a month and since the first day I noticed a difference. If your ready to get your life back on track talk to your doctor about this medication. Not all medication is right for everyone. You have to find the right kind_ I have!!!. The only thing that scares me is what about when i decide to get pregnant.

Gained insomnia_ sweating & hotter thermostat in body_ agitation_ and just in the last few days increased libido. I'm hoping to start losing weight_ gain more libido_ and wean down Lex to 5mg. Dreams also vivid. Mood: swings are gone_ can handle stuff that used to make me boil inside or go paranoid; gives my brain the ability to see both responses in a situation and pick the right one & feel good about it.

I also feel very disoriented when waking up.  Sometimes I know I'm awake and can hear my roommates_ but can't move or open my eyes.  It has helped with depression.

First time I ever quit-- nearly two months smoke-free!  After first week_ all cigarette cravings were behavior-related (driving_ taking dog for a walk_ bored...). Still taking Wellbutrin for depression_ which is worse than ever (had that since age 13 too). Adding Zoloft tomorrow_ combined with Wellbutrin. Also prescribed Klonopin for sleeping.

When I smoked crack and crystal meth (keep in mind this was the first time I'd ever smoked either one) while on Wellbutrin_ I literally didn't eat for almost four days.  Without illicit drug use my appetite is about the same as before Wellbutrin.,I was originally on Lexapro_ but all it did was give me weird dreams and make it so I couldn't have an orgasm (I could get close_ but no cigar).  My psychiatrist gave me Wellbutrin_ which has not helped with my anxiety_ has hardly helped at all with me being ADHD_ has helped with my dysthymia more than anything else_ but has given me the new problem of being extremely angry and bitchy.  It does help me get up in the morning_ so I'm able to work and go to school again.  I don't know what to say except that for short-term use I guess it's okay_ but I can't stay on this stuff forever.  In fact I want off of it soon.,F,19,2  months,2/25/2007,Wellbutrin sr

The combination works beautifully for me. This is the fourth antidepressant I have used. When originally diagnosed in April '93_ I tried Paxil. That had some beneficial effects_ but those plateaued after a few months. I then tried Prozac_ which was disastrous for me -- I had the hallucination-like effects that others have reported. (That said_ I know many people who have been greatly helped by Prozac.) I then took Zoloft for several years_ which worked well but was accompanied by weight gain and some loss of libido. Three points anyone considering Wellbutrin (or any other antidepressant) should consider:  First_ everyone has their own reactions to these drugs_ and it is important to monitor yourself carefully. Just because Prozac was bad for me doesn't mean that I think that no one should take it.  Second_ these drugs take a few weeks to work_ especially if you have bee,F,35,5  years,2/21/2007,Wellbutrin sr

I think i have never felt such a sexual desire before wellbutrin_ i became a beast in bed.  So i kept on taking it but after a few days i become to feel very angry and suspiscious_ the anger was really rough_ my heart beated like it never did before.  I felt anxious all the time so i quit.  the feeling went away after a few days. So what i'm going to do now is start with a very small dose every day_ and double it every week_ so it doesn't go that fast and my brains can addept to this new drug_ I think it's gonna work and i hope because the sex is f*cking great!!!,M,25,5  days,2/16/2007,Wellbutrin sr

496, 5, Depression,Cons: Occasional irritability (minimal) and racing heart. Did read all the postings here_ and have avoided caffeine and alcohol. Have also rather avoided taking my low blood pressure medication in this week_ because I suspect it might cause heart palpitations in conjunction with Wellbutrin_ but will test it next week. Pros: Increased concentration and libido_ able to deal with stuff more easily_ less obsessive/negative thoughts_ just a general feeling of being intrigued by the world again.,Have suffered from depression from age 12 and have tried various coping mechanisms- strenuous exercise_ denial_ Zoloft_ Ciprimal_ Cymbalta. Realised that my depression is genetical and it often kicks in round about puberty. SSRIs didn't quite seem to do the trick for me- didn't feel like myself anymore_ or like I was behind a pane of glass all the time.Have been on 150mg Wellbutrin SR for 5 days now and I think this is maybe just the class of drugs that I needed all along. The side-effects thus far were so minimal that I can hardly believe it. Before this I was on Cymbalta_ which made me incredibly sleepy and also killed my libido (what does it help if you're in Teletubbie land_ but your libido is gone!?!).Can't wait to see what happens in the next few weeks_ especially as the dosage is increased. Must just add that I try to exercise 3-4 times a week- it really helps lift depression.,F,25,5  days,2/1/2007Email,Wellbutrin sr

I was delighted to read that most of the dizzy patients report that it goes away after the first couple weeks.  I'm going to stick it out.  I feel stronger and more lively in just a few days on Wellbutrin and I'm looking forward to the increased sex drive but it's hard to feel sexy when you're dizzy.,The effexor was very effective in treating my depression.  I had taken it for a year and a half but instead of my sex drive returning it was just getting worse and worse so I complained to my doctor and he switched to Wellbutrin.

Then quit smoking. I talked with some friends and they suggested cutting my smokes down during the last week_ which I did (every day_ 2 or 3 fewer smokes).  Happy to say it workd like a charm.  I am blown away having not smoked in 44 days - with  no desire to do so. I can't even really relate to having been a nasty one-and-a-half-pack a day smoker.

I am thinking that maybe I should lower my dosage back to the 150 mgs... I will speak with the doc on this ASAP,I think that it has helped me start to feel again and not be so depressed. I am sleeping better at night.  Except for the uncontrollable itching that I am experiencing.  All is good.  My husband has noticed that I seem to be feeling better.  With all that I have read about sticking with it I am going to continue with it.

512, 1, Depression & Adult ADD,Upset stomache_ nervous feeling_ desire to seriously harm others.,First of all_ I think my doctor prescribed this drug as a cop out for prescribing me a real drug for my Adult ADD.  She took me off of my Zoloft and put me on 100mg of Wellbutrin_ twice a day.  I was okay during the weaning off of zoloft period (about a month) and then I felt pretty good for about a week or two.  It didn't take long before the sh*t hit the fan.  I was in my kitchen_ innocently cooking breakfast when I had a strong desire to seriously hurt a visitor that I was expecting in the forthcoming hour.  This led to days of me thinking about harming lots of other people.  I'm by no means a violent person.  This drug is EVIL! I had read the comments on here_ but didn't think it would happen to me.  Boy was I wrong!  It just kinda snuck up on me too!  Be careful and keep this in mind!!!  I stopped taking it immediately.,F,33,3  months,12/16/2006,Wellbutrin sr

I still have energy and sex drive_ but now I'm more calm and have peace of mind. I also had to add a lot of extra fiber to my diet to correct the awful constipation.

I made that mistake once and will never do it again. ,I suffered from depression for 10 years. Started when I was 11 when my best friend died and just got worse throughtout the years. My freshman year of college I had to drop out due to an illness. I got even more depressed that I had to leave school. I slept for weeks on end without getting out of bed except to eat and use the restroom. My doc put me on Effexor at first and increased the dosage every week or so until I complained about out of body experiences. He put me on wellbutrin which I stayed on for a few years. I LOVED this pill. While on this pill I learned how to cope and deal with my problems WITHOUT yelling or crying or even allowing myself to get depressed and sleep all day. I had more energy_ I was easier to be around_ I had a social life again. A little over a year ago_ I was able to get off Wellbutrin and maintain and happy_ healthy lifestyle.,F,22,2  years,12/7/2006Email,Wellbutrin sr

So I decided to try Wellbutrin_ went straight to 400mg_ and noticed that I was less tired and my sex drive came back and my appetite went back to usual and i got 5 pounds over a month or so (I wished it was more).  However_ since I wasent on mood stabilizers_ when I switched to mania it was 100 times worse I felt like I was on Cocaine and had to be put back on risperdal and klonopin to tame me down and now I'm back to my depressed self.

I am not sure the dose I am on is worth the side effects...but I am not willing to give up on this since it seems better than any other medication as far as libido or depersonalization.,F,45,10  years,10/29/2006,Wellbutrin sr

All over the body_ hands swollen like balloons hives.  Backed off to 150mg and took benedryl because I didn't want to get off it.  Waited about a week and hives toned down.  Back on 300mg and only have mild itching which will welt if I scratch too much.  Sex is great again!,I have tried many antidepressants and this one is by far the best for me.  I couldn't deal with the tiredness and loss of sex drive that Paxil_ Prozac_ and Lexapro gave me.  I love how I feel energetic and even if I sleep a little less I feel rested.  Depression gone even though life problems are going on full force.  I don't get so anxious and sad over it.  I used to just lay in bed and wish each day would just get over.  I'm glad I stuck through the hives... just a little itchy now.  Waiting for the weight loss and cigarette smoking to stop.  (I hope) Even though that is not why I take it_ it would be a nice side benefit. Paxil made me feel dead sexually.

However_ 4 weeks after increasing my dose from 200mg to 300mg I found myself in the ER with my first panic attack.  The doctors gave me Ativan to prevent the panic attacks but it was never the same.  I decided to stop taking Wellbutrin after 6 months because I was in constant fear of having a seizure or another panic attack and using Ativan long term is not good.  If I can find something other than Ativan to stop the panic attacks then I will try Wellbutrin again.  Nothing worked on my depression like Wellbutrin did.

The pain is a fraction of what is was. I accomplish more during the day. My mood is better (perhaps because I have my life back). Because I experienced tinnitus_ my doctor had me cut back my dosage and take it every other day. Within less than a week the fibromyalgia symptoms began to return. I knew that if I stopped taking Wellbutrin completely_ ALL of my fibromyalgia symptoms would probably return.  I'd rather have a little buzzing in my ears once in a while than to ever go back to the fibromyalgia prison that my life used to be. I will never stop taking or cut back on Wellbutrin again. I am back up to my full dosage of 225mg/day - where I will stay. They'd have to pull this stuff from my white-knuckled fist to make me stop taking it.

The only thing I can compare it to is the feeling you get when you are weening yourself off of antidepressants or constantly on a boat_ I couldn't do anything all day. That was my only day like that.  But since then_ I have been exhausted..as in coming home for a nap during lunch and crashing by ten o'clock.  Since Day 10_ I have been incredibly sad - outbursts in tears_ very irritable and lack of drive to work/have sex/do anything. The worst of all is the massive anxiety during the day. My doc also gave me a prescription for Nivaram (Xanax) which I have been digesting twice a day. Bad part is that the Nivaram was for any emergency panic attacks_ not daily calm-me-downs.

One year ago was fired a 2nd time after taking wellbutrin SR for 2 weeks_ same story...uncharacteristic rage and hostility.  If there's ever a class action for actual_ real losses_ I'm signing up.  Why?  Not because it causes rage and extreme irritability_ but because no-where on the label_ websites_ or any associated literature do the side effects state rage as a possibility.

However_ I feel the benefit of this medication outweighs the side-effects.,F,26,2  years,8/14/2006,Wellbutrin sr
581, 5, anxiety mild depression,irritable_ increased anger_ some trouble sleeping,i was wondering about the effects of Wellbutrin but after reading the postings_ find that my symtoms are normal for someone just starting out on the drug. My libedo is unbelively stronger(fear i'm becoming a nympho!) but when i was on paxil it like i had been neutered. i've noticed an increase in sadness and was concerned but_ from what i've been reading_ this will pass. i hope this is the one for me. i want to get back into life and stop being so angry_ doubtful_ and down on myself.,M,44,4  days,8/11/2006Email,Wellbutrin sr
582, 5, mild depression/anxiety,,I am posting this in part to comment on the postings I've read and in part to set the stage for my 'final answer' on wellbutrin SR. I've only been on it for about a week (100mg SR in morning). No noticeable side effects although it seems like I have more energy at the end of the day.  I want to comment on what I've read here: It seems like many folks were 'overdosed' and ramped up too quickly with this drug. I am now taking into account all the bad experiences (and good) and am going to take it more slowly since I don't have severe depression and can afford to tek my time. After about 2 months I'll post again.  I have heard it said that nobody can predict how you will do on an antidepressant and that it is basically a crap shoot.  I'm taking the gamble that this drug will improve my energy/concentration at work and not adversely affect my relationships and home life. jr,M,49,7  days,8/6/2006,Wellbutrin sr
583, 2, Panic Attacks,"My Doctor prescribed Wellbutrin for ""panic attacks""...turned out I had Arrythmia which needed to be corrected by an ablation procedure. Wellbutrin caused many side effects and did not help my arrythmia. I would caution those who think they have panic attacks that it may be arrythmia which is completly different although the symptoms are the same...",,M,43,1  months,8/4/2006,Wellbutrin sr
584, 4, Depression,First few days I felt strange and had terrible headaches_ but stick with it because they go away. However_ I still have the agitation side effect and a constantly anxious feeling_ as well as the ringing in the ears that everyone talks about. Although they say it makes you lose your appetite_ and I am eating much more but not gaining weight yet.,The depression has absolutely lifted_ but I agree that CAFFEINE is terrible with Wellbutrin. Today I finally figured out that the agitation is very correlated with caffeine intake. The days I don't have caffeine_ I feel much better.,F,23,1  months,8/3/2006,Wellbutrin sr

586, 2, To even out mood swings/weight loss,Only side effect has been horrible itching/rash/hives,I started with 150 mg. once a day for the first week_ then moved to twice a day.  Mood swings evened out and I've been sleeping great_ but sadly_ appetite was unaffected as was sex drive (which wasn't bad to begin with).  After two weeks_ I got super-itchy bumps on my left ankle which I thought were bug bites until they started spreading.  My arms also itched horribly after every shower_ but I didn't make the connection to the medicine until yesterday_ when I started itching all over my body.  Now I have a rash all over the place and hives everywhere I itch (ribs_ breasts_ arms_ small of back_ groin_ neck_ behind ears)... I can't stand it.  Of course it's Saturday and the Dr. isn't it_ but I'm stopping it NOW until I can talk to him Monday.,F,40,18  days,7/29/2006,Wellbutrin sr
587, 1, Depression_ Vague Anxiety,The first 3 days were golden. I woke up with the energy of a beast and my libido was through the roof. I woke up feeling like I could scale a mountain or shotput a tank... But after less than half a week_ things reversed and I felt very VERY down_ edgy_ anxious_ teary_ and exhausted. Things got so bad I was forced to go off the drug. I had to go off because the mood swings were getting too much.,The same medicine may work well for someone and very poorly for another. People respond differently to different medicines because we are all different_ each of us with a unique brain chemisty.This medicine happened to work very POORLY for me_ but that's just me. If you try it and you don't like it (after giving it a reasonable amount of time) then STOP. Try something else. Don't be afraid to see a doctor and experiment to see what works for you.and...

I noticed once when I turned to check oncoming traffic that my eyes kinda twitching but nothing like earlier in the week.

589, 3, Depression,feel jittery inside_ headache (one day)_ crying more_ hard time coping_ no appetite at all_ MAJOR short term memory loss,I contribute these side effects to the fact that my system needs to adjust to the med.  Despite the side effects_ I feel as though my depression is lifting_ although I have had my emotions on a whirlwind with crying jags since taking the med.  The short term memory loss is the worse side effect_ but this will subside.  I experienced the same thing when I started Lexapro and it did eventually go away.  Lexapro made me tired during the day.  With Wellbutrin_ I have NO daytime sleepiness at all.  Will keep you informed when I've been on it a little longer.,F,35,7  days,7/19/2006,Wellbutrin sr

592, 4, Depression,No negative side effects,WB XL has helped_ I am not nearly as depressed and angry at everything and everyone as I was prior to taking WBXL. The suicidal thoughts have decreased from almost constant (4-5x/hr or more) to perhaps only 8-10 times a day. I am currently on 300mg/day. My wife also thinks the WB XL has helped_ she said I am starting to act more congenial like I was when we married and also redeveloping my long lost sense of humor. I feel better than I was_ but have a long way to go. Psychotherapy starts in three weeks_ doc says it will help in addition to the WB Xl. I hope so!

I take 150 in morning and haven't experienced anything yet_ nothing_ natta.

596, 2, Depression_ Anxiety,Extreme sweatiness_ mild agitation_ slight headache.,Wellbutrin never really did anything for me.  I mainly took it for a time so I could counter adverse sexual side effects of the SSRIs (Luvox_ Lexapro)_ and while it did help somewhat for that purpose_ overall the experience was not worth it.  The SSRIs were not helping the anxiety and depression anyway_ and as a cigarette smoker (not quite ready to quit_ Wellbutrin-style)_ I actually found this drug caused increased appetite_ as I could not smoke at all.  Bottom line: stay away from SSRIs and Wellbutrin virtually serves no purpose and is quite ineffective.,M,22,2  months,6/23/2006,Wellbutrin sr

599, 4, Long untreated low-grade depression,Initially: insomnia_ headaches_ sore-throat_ anxiousness (since the thought of using a psychotropic scared me). Loquatiousness.After a few weeks: CLARITY! More fore-thought and effective ACTION instead of REACTION. Absolutely NO anxiety. My libido has gone through the roof. I went from not really caring about sex_ to wanting it twice a day...now I just have to find a girl with enough energy. Rediscovered the female race and found the time to catch up with a dear old friend I hadn't seen in a long while: my penis!,"I am a ""funny guy""_ and usually make light of most things...apparently_ I have an excellent sense of humor_ though upon refelction it looks as though this has been a front for my ongoing low-grade depression which had been haunting me since I was about 16. I've had a habit of making jokes of just about EVERYTHING in life_ if only to avoid comming to terms with my own inner-sadness and dissatisfaction with my life up to now. I have been a heavy beer drinker since my early 20s_ though probably a rung or two below what I would consider an ""alcoholic"". Drank probably 6 beers a day_ easy. Weekends were worse. I stopped drinking entirely when I started Wellbutirn_ and have had absolutely no problems or desire to drink since. I am confident now I had been self-medicating_ and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my back.

602, 5, depression,major anxiety,Ok_ so I was doing great on Wellbutrin for 4 days then I had a HUGE bout of anxiety that lasted several hours.  Racing heart_ racing brain that I could not slow down_ obsessing about something that means nothing (packing my lunch for work the next day)_ etc.  So I was trying to figure out what was different about Sunday than any of the other days when I didn't have any problems and I figured it out: CAFFEINE.  I had a major reaction right after I drank a Diet Coke.  I got online and sure enough_ Wellbutrin is listed as a drug that interacts with caffeine causing anxiety_ racing thoughts_ palpatations_ etc.  I didn't drink any yesterday and was totally fine.  Just wanted to put this out there b/c it seems like lots of ppl have the anxiety side effect and for me_ it was caffeine. Be careful.

Once I did_ though_ LOOK OUT!  I felt awesome.  I cannot even describe the difference between before and after.  I became a brand new person_ and not in the 'bad way' that everyone seems to assume happens when one takes anti-depressants.  I felt more like myself than I had ever felt before in my life.  It just felt right.  Before I took Wellbutrin_ I couldn't stay awake_ I couldn't eat_ I cried constantly about nothing_ (or about what_ I didn't know)_ I lost 25 pounds in a very short period of time_ and I was getting to the point where I was being sent home from work because I was SO unproductive.  3 months on this little purple pill_ and I was happy_ more confident_ more social_ more sexual.  I have suffered from depression on and off since I was 12_ so feeling happy_ and not feeling guilty about feeling happy was a brand new experience for me_ and I'll never look,F,33,6  years,5/10/2006Email,Wellbutrin sr

I was also tired all the time_ still as insecure as ever_ and to top it all off - grumpy. I was taking Novo-Bupropion SR_ 150 MG twice a day_ 8 hours apart_ 7:30 am and 3:30 pm. On my 2nd appt with my dr. at 17 days of being on this dosage_ I told her my symptoms. She recommended only taking 150 mg in the morning. I took her suggestion and have been feeling great ever since. My libido has increased incredibly (better than ever maybe)_ I feel good enough to start exercising again_ and to start doing good things for myself (improving myself spiritually and emotionally). Much better than the Celexa I was on previously. Maybe part of the problem in the first 17 days was that my dr. took me off Celexa cold turkey to put me on Wellburtrin.,I'm now able to live in the moment_ leaving stressful situations at work.

She prescribed me Effexor_ but before taking it I did some research on the net and did not feel comfortable with it.Went back and asked for Wellbutrin SR _ since this also might stop my nicotine craving.  For 4 weeks I took 100mg SR once/day (mornings). The only effect so far : I smoke less. . Still depressed and anxious though. Today is my 3rd day of taking 150mg/day (once in the morning). . I am going to stick with it another 2 weeks - if my depression doesn't get better I will discontinue taking it. I was also wondering if the initial dosage was not high enough to start with.

I previously used the patch to quit smoking_ and it worked great until I got off the patch_ then it was an immediate relapse.  I didn't feel so great the first week I took the Wellbutrin.  I almost considered quitting it. But decided to try a  little longer.  By the end of the secound week.  and after I started the full dose of 2 pills a day.  I was down to 3 cigarettes a day.  I was actually kinda afraid to quit completely because I was afraid of withdrawls.  5 days ago I said tomorrow I won't smoke.  I had 2 cigarettes sitting in a pack for me.  And I havne't smoked since then. I QUIT.  I was easy.  No withdrawls at all.  I actually feel great.  It was just hard to get myself to stop thinking about smoking.  But It wasn't a craving__ just a thought.  This drug is amazing.  ThanksSmoker for 12 years,F,29,4  weeks,4/29/2006,Wellbutrin sr

My social anxiety has lessened_ I have less nervous break downs_ I am not numbed by this medication at all. I still feel like myself but happier and more stable. The only side effects that I don't like is the irritability and short term memory loss. I sort of feel stupid for the amount that I forget now.

By Day 2 my body was feeling stronger and I felt like a fog bank was clearing all around me.  I even went to the gym because I was feeling so good.  Had some trouble sleeping too.  Day 3 - I felt more confident_ optimistic_ and drawn more to light.  I went to the gym again and felt euphoric during my run.  Day 4 and 5 were not good because I over exerted myself at the gym on Day 2 and 3 and now I'm exhausted and in pain.  So far this medication has lifted depression like Zoloft never did and I still feel like me.  I continue to exercise and feel even better afterwards.  I have noticed that I've not had much sexual interest this week.  Day 6 feels good again and it just feels impossible to be depressed on this medication.

618, 4, Depression,"At the beginning only_ slight heart rate increase but went back to normal after two weeks. Decreased appetite_ decrased need for sleep (insomnia sometimes). Makes me act out sometimes_ maybe even cranky. I get hot very easily and i sweat more_ makes me want to wear light clothes all the time. Lowers alcohol tolerance and alcohol ""stupidity"" and blackout threshold (i.e. i act out if i drink and i don't remember the next day). Be careful if you decide to drink despite warnings_ might make you feel anxious and give you insomnia the following days.",I specifically asked my doctor for this medication because i dont like SSRIs. Turned out to be a good alternative because no sex side effects_ yawning or strange feelings. Very positive overall_ boosts your drive and motivation_ makes you less sensitive to problems of everyday life. As a bonus_ it does help you quit smoking. I eat a lot less and I  tend to crave healthier foods like fruits and veggies. I didn't have a weight problem but i guess eating well is always a good thing...

Right now the principle side effects are urinary frequency and decreased urinary stream_ which are annoying. Insomnia and decreased appetite I consider to be benefits of Wellbutrin_ so I'm not worried about that. Drinking alcohol has a very negative effect physically and emotionally_ much more than pre-wellbutrin days. Typically a two day funk ensues after a night of drinking_ not to mention agonizing an headache the night and morning after. Overall_ it's been a great help with the ADD and mild depression. The only problematic side effect is urinary frequency_ but so far the benefits outweigh the negatives.,M,28,7  days,4/14/2006,Wellbutrin sr

This is good thing in general_ though sometimes nightmares are slighty more frightening. But most of my vivid dreams are amazing!  You really experience them.  It's quite a treat.  Wellbutrin also makes me sweat easily though I'm very active. As far as sex_ that was the reason I chose this over all the others.    Indeed_ it has made my libido strong_ which like the exciting dreams is a nice side effect.",I never tried another anti-depressant and I have no regrets.  Some people say Wellbutrin doesn't work well but I disagree.  It has saved my life.  After 5+ years on 200mg 2x/day I'm now on 150mg 2x/day.  I notice the difference - I can get more depressed than I was used to - but it has also freed me.  I hope to keep lowering my dose over the next few years_ though I don't know if I can ever get off this because my depression was drug-abuse related and there's probably some permanent chemical imbalance upstairs.

Don't worry too much about side effects listed here and on the med's sheet; they happen to certain people some of the time and usually completely disappear within a few (1 or 2) weeks.  Stick with your medication and talk to your doctor.,This is a great medication!  After trying about all SSRIs out there I was started on Prozac (up to 40mg daily) + Wellbutrin (up to 300mg daily) and it FINALLY happened within 2 months of starting this med! I was ALIVE again! Concentration was back_ I was enjoying life again and most importantly for me I was not anxious about everything.  After 3 years on leave from work I was back (and good at it) and 50 pounds lighter too due to decreased appetite.  At one point we (my psy and I) increased my Wellbutrin to 450mg daily but it didn't do anything more so we lowered it back to 300mg daily. Wellbutrin clearly gave me a boost of energy; at one point I did a home project that lasted 6 weeks at 10 hours/day and I was full of energy (no_ I'm not bipolar).  I had never experienced soi much energy. Then the energy decreased to a more normal level.A note about Prozac in this context: when I was started on Prozac alone (10mg daily) my panic attacks ceased completely within a week.  Maybe also,M,45,700  days,3/12/2006,Wellbutrin sr
631, 5, Depression + Anxiety/Panic Attacks,See my other post...,(continued from first part)A note about Prozac in this context: when I was started on Prozac alone (10mg daily) my panic attacks ceased completely within a week.  Maybe also the feeling of taking charge medically of my problem helped with the helplessness I was feeling and the anxiety it created.  I don't know.After 6 months of going well on 40mg Prozac + 300mg Wellbutrin we (actually I) decided to decrease all medication *very progressively* and then stop completely. After 6 months of being OK (no depression_ no anxiety) anxiety crept back again so I'm considering getting back on the meds now.  STICK WITH YOUR TREATMENT and follow your health pro's advice.

I am slightly worried about 'floaters' in visual field of my left eye right now_ but those may or may not have anything to do with WB. In the past (years ago) I've tried Zoloft (wore off after a few months)_ Effexor (yeach - and very hard to get off of)_ and also Depakote (not sure this did a darn thing other than make me gain weight). Of all these WB is definitely the best thing so far.,At this point I'd say it is definitely helping my depression. I feel normal again. I have hey_ ambition_ again!

It was like an evil_ alien me. I cant believe my friends put up with it for so long before telling me. Ive now stopped drinking completley and I feel its a small compromise for getting my life back but BE CAREFUL!,I was on Effexor xl for 3 years for GAD but hadnt adressed my depression (for last 10 years maybe) and Effexor did nothing for my depression obviously.

I ENJOY LIVING_ I have MOTIVATION_ which I didnt have for years! I go to the gym_ watch what I eat and Ive lost 45lbs.On the whole Wellbutrin is absolutely amazing_ im thinking of reducing from 300mg to 150mg to see how it goes.

658, 5, Depression/Anxiety,WELLBUTRIN BENEFICIAL:Initially experienced some insomnia_racy/anxious feelings_confusion but these slowly past and rapidly diminished at the beginning of week 5. BE PATIENT_ these type of drugs can take time to reset the brain chemistry. The Wellbutrin has minimal effect on Serotonin and primarily acts on Dopamine and Norepinephirine; in my case_ this has worked.,I am now in week 5 of using Wellbutrin (one week as a mono med) and I am finding it very effective in lifting mood and energy levels; plus_I have had an increase in concentration. As a number of other posters cautioned_ it did take a full 4 weeks for the Wellbutrin to begin to achieve a good level of  treatment effectiveness (and I certainly did want to throw the towel in a few times). My sincere thanks to everyone who shared their own experiences and emphasised the need to BE PATIENT and allow the drug time to level out the brain chemistry. As my anxiety seems to have improved with the Wellbutrin alone_ I am now comfortable that_ should I experience a serious anxiety increase_ I can_ per others experience and my discussions with my doctor_ use Xanax to manage such a moment.

I get really angry over the dumbest things; I am constantly yelling at my husband and child then go crazy emotionally because I know how I am acting is wrong!,I can't decide if the side effects are worse than the depression. I know I am only 4 days in but I can't keep a rational though in my head. Family_ friends and co-workers have noticed a tremendous change in me (for the worse) and I am afraid if these symptoms continue I will end up alienating my husband and daughter.

I feel kind of flighty...a slight increase in BP and resting heart rate as well.,I was moderately depressed_ dysthymic type. This is the first antidepressant I had tried and I reasearch others before choosing this one for lack of side effects such as weight gain and loss of libido. It has helped greatly- I started feeling better after a week or two. The side effects are still kind of bothersome_ especially the memory loss and flightiness as it makes me seem kind of stupid sometimes_ even though I am an excellent student.

It was hard to stop using it_ it caused very bad headaches and bad moods until it got out of my system.,It never really seemed to help me all that much.

Now after taking this drug for several months I have also noticed that my memory recall is very poor_ it's hard to rememeber things and sometimes my vision is out of focus.  It feels as if my brain pulsates or is actually moving around in my skull. I have a hard time concentrating because I feel,After several months of taking this drug I found that it took at least 25-35 days to notice a difference in my mind set. I was depressed and suicidal and attempted to kill myself before taking Wellbutrin SR. The thought of dying was in my mind everyday_ at least 20 times a day I would think of it. I have noticed a  huge attitude change_ I see the world and people differently now. It even helped me get rid of a lousy boyfriend because of the new found thinking. I am a happier person_ I'm not explosive and most of my anxiety is gone.  This drug is great_ I would recommend it_ eventhough I still have a hard time recalling_ remembering and dealing with the dizziness. I've lost about 13 pounds_ the insomnia is dissapating (finally!) and I have found a dramatic increase in my sex drive.

Took it for a year. When I went on it another time (many years later) I was sleepy all the time because it reduced my REM latency to zero. I literally started dreaming as I fell asleep.

Keep an eye out for that reduced REM latency thing. Someone else on this forum reported feeling really sleepy after being on it a while_ and I bet she had the same reaction.

Seems to do okay so far_ we will see. I have moderate mental illness_ schizo-affective_(bipolar type)_ dissociative with general depression.

It just makes me feel more normal -- able to enjoy things more_ not worry as much_ not feel so tired all the time and actually want to have sex again.

730, 3, Depression,Increased energy_ clearer thinking_ increased libido. Irritation_ impatience_ weird vivid dreams_ crying spells.,After taking Prozac for over 15 years libido became non-existent and became very lethargic and sleepy although not depressed. Prozac also made my thinking lazy. I felt like I had only two choices. Take the Prozac and be stupid and happy or don't take it and be smart and depressed. Visited GP and asked to try Wellbutrin. Quit the Prozac (was taking 5-10 mg/day) and started Wellbutrin XL 150. At first felt great but Prozac has a long half life and it was probably still affecting me along with the Wellbutrin. Once the Prozac had totally worn off (2-3 weeks)libido increased but I started having crying spells_ weird vivid dreams and became very impatient and irritable with people. On just Prozac I never cried. Added back 5 mg of Prozac and am feeling much more normal although not as energetic as without it and my libido is not increased as much (or enough). Today I tried taking 300 mg Wellbutrin. It's midnight and I am still awake! I usually am asleep by 10:00 or 11:00 and sleep well through the night since adding the Prozac back.  So much for that little experiment.,F,50,3  months,1/15/2005,Wellbutrin sr

737, 4, To regain sex drive lost by prozac,GOOD : Increase in sex drive_ sexual desire_ sexual feeling_ sexual sensitivity in groins_ sexual fantasy. Increase in productivity (work)_ workplace and home cleanliness and organization_ increase in energy. Increase in concentration and interest for things and activities. BAD : A little anxiety in social situations_ fidgety (kept on biting nails) ... Rapid heartbeat if 2 doses taken too close to each other (150mg per dose) . Mainly anxiety and paranoia in social situations . Also increase in anger_ temper and irritatability .,Am into roughly week 6 of wellbutrin 150 mg x 2 a day . Took it because prozac (shitfuckpisscuntdrug) took away my sex drive totally and completely . To say more about my sex drive_ well_ I feel that it has definitely improved since I started taking wbt (wellbutrin) . Infact_ on day 2 or so_ I got VERY aroused and sexually stimulated . The sexual arousal peaks and drops mostly . But I would say _ baseline wise _ sex drive is definitely increased . (not to my full horniness experienced during pre-prozac days of bliss) I certainly hope that this drug will push my sex drive to what it was before I took that shitty drug prozac . I am also wondering if the changes effected in this drug are permanent . It costs quite a lot and don't want to have to take it every day of my life . I just would like maybe a 3-6 month period and then when my sex drive is back to normal _ I'd quit the drug _ maintaining my high sex drive . I will also have to comment about wellbutrin and it's increase in productivity effect . It's good ... As for depression _ I can't say much about it _ I don't feel necessarily happier I just feel around the same ... I will post again maybe when im at the 8 week mark or 3 mth mark . Hopefully _ by then I will have that crazy fetishious super sexed up sex drive I've had before . Sexuality rules . I would like to hear from other people who have had their sex drive robbed by prozac on whether it is a permanent effect or not ... please do email me ... Also ... would like to hear from people who have had success with wellbutrin reversing these effects _ or in general just increasing libido and how long it took . Thanks .

I went on a diet and was able to lose 40lbs_ stopped smoking after 6 months.,unfortunately_ I am on the verge of divorce because I have a husband on Lexapro_an antidepressant that decreases sexual desire and preformance.I am on Wellbutrin which  side effect of Wellbutrin is an annoyng increase in libido.  I say annoyng since considering my sex_ I can do nothing to satisfy my longings except cry.  well you can see how that would be a problem for a marraige.  I have lots of energy for fixing up the house_ he is asleep.  I want to be loved_ and he is asleep or he is very frustrated since apparantly his Lexapro has the opposite effect on him.  I wish our Docter was more knowledgable about these medications.  Why would a Docter put him on Lexapro If he already has trouble staying awake.  I just feel like screaming my head off at her.  That would be the agitation.  I am happy about the new improved body_ and the smoking_ but I NEED SEX_ or i will have to say goodbye to Wellbutrin and become a fat smoking numb person that lives with a sleeping person_ both of which are agitated and depressed.,F,44,2  years,1/1/2005,Wellbutrin sr

I took ambien the other night - slept 3 hours and was up since 2:30 AM.  Last night I took a muscle relaxer to fall asleep_ then another to go back to sleep after i woke up in 4 hours.  Wierd dreams but that doesnt bother me.  I was prescribed this for work related anxiety but it has made me so moody and sensitive and depressed.  I cried at work yesterday which was really embarassing.  I just dont feel like I have anything to be happy about which was not the case before I took this.  I also got a big boost of energy - lost 5 pounds already because my appetite has deminished/ i forget to eat.

I am now just starting Wellbutrin sr at 150/day tomorrow I go to 300/day...I am encouraged by what I have seen posted here please wish me well....,M,47,3  days,11/26/2004,Wellbutrin sr

I had already regulated some of my moodiness with diet (no sugar_ whole grains_ less achohol)_ but the overall lack of motiviation to perform tasks still remained. Wellbutrin really gave me a lot of energy and helped me realize that things aren't so overwhelming. My does was 300mg_ and my doctor just bumped it up to 450 to see if it helped with ADD symptoms. I think it was already helping somewhat at 300mg_ and the increase isn't making much of a difference_ so I'll probably go back to 300mg.,M,29,8  months,11/24/2004,Wellbutrin sr

762, 5, Anxiety_ Depression,Dry mouth_ hot flashes_ heart palpitations,This drug saved my life.  Please note that most of those who have posted very negative comments here took the drug for a very short period.  All I can say is that yes_ THE FIRST THREE WEEKS TO MONTH of taking Wellbutrin is difficult and sometimes enough to make you want to quit.  After your body has had time to level out_ however_ most of the unpleasant side effects completely disappear(insomnia_ vivid dreaming_ confusion_ easy to anger_ shaking.)  You have to ride out that initial period and it's not easy_ but completely worth it.  It may even seem that it is impossible to endure_ but you can get through it and you will come out on the other side with a new life.I do believe that everyone who begins Wellbutrin should commit to three months trial.  You can pretty much count on that the first 4-6 weeks will not be great_ but if you want the benefits you must be patient.This drug is nothing like the other antidepressants.  I would never take Zoloft again_ that is certain.Wellbutrin will give you back your sex life and for some women a dramitically increased intensity of orgasm.  It does for me.

783, 5, post partum depression,Initially_ headaches and pressure in my head that went away after a week or two.  Occasional auditory disturbances and ongoing short term memory loss.  Not sure if memory loss was due to this drug_ but I've heard other people say it too.  The side effects are nothing compared to the feeling of depression which has subsided for the most part.  I have occasional down days as do most people.,,F,38,3  years,9/14/2004Email,Wellbutrin sr
784, 2, depression,,I switched to Wellbutrin from Celexa due to weight gain and fatigue.  Although I only took Wellbutrin for 5 days_ I became more depressed with several episodes of crying.  I ate more food (bread) to reduce the nauseated feeling.  I felt as though I would faint several times; I became very easily agitated; and I experienced pain along my spine.   I felt jittery and felt pressure in my head.  In addition_ I began to worry about EVERYTHING.  The side effects were becoming noticeably more intense--to the point that my husband said he did NOT want me to take the medicine again.  I am now taking Celexa again.  The only side effects I experience are:  weight gain and fatigue.,F,33,5  days,9/12/2004,Wellbutrin sr
785, 3, Stop Smoking & Weight Loss,First week I thought I was going out of my mind.  Called doctor & he said to stick with it.  I didn't have any desire to smoke whatsoever.  Metal taste in my mouth_ diet soda tastes flat_ have no interest in food_ could easily become anorexic.  After four weeks I was down 8 pounds_ these last two weeks I've lost another 9 pounds.  I have pain/pressure in my head that the doctor didn't seem to be too concerned with.  After the first week I noticed that three days in a row I periodically saw verticle lines in my vision (if that makes sense).  He switched me from 300 MG XL to 150 SR 2x's a day_ which I now lowered myself to only once a day_ also put me on topamax 25 mgs for one week_ then 50 mgs for one week_ 75 mgs for one week_ now 100 mg's everyday.  Researched it and people are calling it dopamax.  My short term memory is zilch and I don't know if it's from the topamax or the Wellbutrin.  My bloodpressure usually runs over 60 and it was over 80_ again_ doctor wasn't concerned.  Been having anxiety and feel as if I'm crawling out of my skin.  Also can't sleep_ averaging 4 hours a night.  Heard you can't stop cold turkey.  Any suggestions from anyone taking the same combinations will be appreciated.  Thanks...,,F,40,6  weeks,8/30/2004,Wellbutrin sr

The withdraw was terrible. I wanted to stop taking it because of the severe weight gain. I went from 165 to 188 in 7 months. I told my doctor that I could not take it anymore because of the weight gain. So he switched me to Wellbutrin sr 300 mg a day. As far as the depression goes it is helping a lot. But I have a really hard time falling a sleep. Plus I moved to another country and time zone which dident help me get on a good sleep schedule in the first place.

851, 4, Recurrent major depression,Nausea and mild loss of appetite for first couple of weeks; headache; lightheadedness; slightly affected balance; occasional night sweats; unstable body temp/hot flashes (I'm too young for menopause_ LOL!!); side effects severe when jumping from 150 mg to 300 mg - had to drop back down and ramp up over the course of a few weeks,From the side effects_ it may sound like Wellbutrin is more trouble than it's worth_ but that's not the case.  It has helped immensely with my depression_ and doesn't make me sluggish and sleepy like Prozac alone does (I take WB with 10 mg of Prozac).  Most of the time_ the side effects are minimal and just a minor nuisiance.  Being able to smile is worth a headache.  :-),F,24,1  years,4/4/2004Email,Wellbutrin sr

After a year or so of feeling fatigued and listless I actually am able to run 10-12 miles per week and have regained some degree of stamina. Felt a tad racey at first but this leveled off after a week or so. All in all out of all the anti-depressants I have ever taken this one has the fewest and mildest side effects....I think it actually increased my libido!(which I figured would never come back after 3 years on Prozac) I would highly recommend this for,F,28,2  years,3/28/2004,Wellbutrin sr

I have tried many meds and this was quite effective in most ways_ but with a few side effects that were troublesome. Within a 2 days it completely eliminated panic spells_ caused markedly increased productivity and to a lesser extent improved attention span_ yet ironically caused more space out spells & occassional_ strange forms of dizziness that seemed more neuro related that the simple circulatory dizziness. Sex drive was normal.What bothered me was the joint pain in hands -- too much at times_ and jaw pain & swelling caused me to constantly bite my mouth--not good. At one point_ I couldn't type (bc of joint pain) and had bitten my mouth 3 x in one day_ so I stopped the meds.

The only reason I discontinued it was on the second week I suffered a major panic attack (although i am a bit anxious...I have never had one of those) on my way into work. It was a horrible feeling and I wasn't sure if  it was just a panic attack or the precursor of a seizure.

Tends to make you more awake and alert_ and able to work more or better_ but may cause increased anxiety (seems to be dose related and also related to the time of day you take the med and what you took before.,I am currently taking Wellbutrin to augment paxil. Paxil fixes a lot of my anxiety problems (panic attack_ obsessive thoughts_ driven nature_ hypercritical nature (finding fault) and a number of other problems that seem related to hypervigilance and anxiety in general. Wellbutrin helps counter the sleepiness or lethargy and also weight gain that seems to come with paxil. I am sensitive to meds- I take 5 mg of paxil in the morning and then 100mg of Wellbutrin SR a few hours later. This combo has so far worked well for me. There may be something better_ but changing meds is a painstaking process. Wellbutrin_ I have found_ also has a pronounced effect on appetite_ it takes away cravings and often you don't feel like eating_ although you can eat if you want to and make a point of doing it. I am concerned about possible effects of both paxil and Wellbutrin on short term memory. Wellbutrin may make OCD worse at times_ also tends to undo some of the effects of paxil_ so if you are taking both you have to be careful how much you take.,M,49,90  days,6/6/2003,Wellbutrin sr

All side effects completely gone after 3 months.,This drug increased my libido_ a welcome effect_ as the depression had completely killed any sexual desire.  It also seems to have reduced the amount of acid my stomach produces_ and thus has cured many gastrointestinal problems I've had over the years.  I have lots of energy and great concentration.  After taking Wellbutrin_ I have entered the most productive and creative time of my life.,F,35, ,2/1/2001Email,Wellbutrin sr
