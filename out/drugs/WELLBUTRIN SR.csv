1, 4, Depression_ADHD_bipolar.,At first: jittery_ dizzy_ constantly hungry_ REALLY thirsty_ and increased sex drive (which is negative_ since I was already demanding it 2-3x a day from boyfriend pre-med). Now: sex drive has evened out_ so has appetite. Lots of energy_ sleep well_ vivid dreams.,I was iffy about this when my psychiatrist prescribed it. I was on the highest safe dose of Setraline (Zoloft) for 5 months. It quit working after 3 months_ when I overdosed in a suicide attempt. Now with the Buproprion (Wellbutrin)_ I feel amazing!!! I have energy_ I can't just lay in bed all day like I use to-even if I wanted to. I have motivation to get up and clean the apartment daily_ whereas I use to do it once a month at most. My bf said I seem a lot happier_ more talkative_ less angry all the time_ less snappy. Also_ I was trying to quit smoking cigarettes before I ever started this med_ but once I took it my cravings for cigs just vanished!!!! After research_ I found that this is clinically proven to help quit smoking. So that's just another benefit. ;) I really do like this drug so far. I've been on countless drugs since being diagnosed with an array of mental disorders at 15_ and none have works as well as this one. I just hope my appetite dies down and I lose weight!!!!,F,19,2  weeks100mg,6/17/2016Email,Wellbutrin sr
2, 1, Bipolar depression,Positive: increased sex driveNegative: increase in suicidal thoughts_ increased negative thoughts_ worse depression_ crying_ feeling disconnected from world_ time distortion_ stiff neck_ vivid dreams. No effect on appetite_ no effect on sleep after day 3.,I really wanted this to work_ and the first two or three days were promising - I felt slightly wired_ more awake_ no desire to rest during day_ but was able to sleep at night. Depression remained about the same. During the second week (still on 150mg)_ I started to feel disconnected from everybody else. Depression got worse_ with feelings of total worthlessness and hopelessness_ and could not concentrate on anything_ constantly distracted. On day 14 I doubled the dose to 150mg twice a day. Big mistake. Thought about suicide all the time_ felt I was already dead_ like a ghost. Time moved very slowly_ every minute felt like an effort to live through. Also became scared of being left alone and asked my husband not to leave me alone for a minute (very unusual for me_ I'm usually quite independent). Stopped medication yesterday and already feel a bit better.,F,56,17  days150 1X D,5/1/2016Email,Wellbutrin sr
3, 5, Depression and Anxiety,The first 3 days were like how other describe as a mild acid trip. There was no sleeping. After that things normalized quickly until i did not even noticed i was on any meds except i was less depressed. The anxiety took a few years to get under control. I also get 30x0.5mg xanax a month to stop any panic attacks when they start. I have never needed to increase my benzo because i refuse to use them in a way that builds tolerance. I may go a few days without taking one then i will have an attack and may need 3 over the course of the day. I didnt think much about drinking on Wellbutrin because i didnt notice a difference. Then i have read horror stories about combining drinking and Wellbutrin. I do not have those or any other ill effects but i dont recommend it for others due to what i read,,M,48,1  days300mg,3/5/2016,Wellbutrin sr
4, 2, Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction,Light stimulation for half an hour when took 2 grams. Lower doses do nothing.,Thought it would revive my libido as I have PSSD. It did not. Had no effect when taken at 150 mg once a day_ so i took 13 150 mg tablets all at once (and crushed them first) (dangerous - do not repeat_ risk of deadly seizure). Had light stimulation from that dose for a short while. No other side effects noticed. A very weak med for me. Expected more.,M,22,1  weeks150 mg-2 g 1X W,2/9/2016Email,Wellbutrin sr
5, 5, anxiety,ringing in ears,I take my dose at bedtime. Most people think this is crazy_ but it eliminates any anxiety during the day that might occur shortly after taking a dose_ because I am asleep!,F,60,10  months150 sr 1X D,1/20/2016,Wellbutrin sr

9, 4, Depression,"Worked pretty well except it kicked in hypomania sometimes because I'm bipolar II  so we had to lower the dose. But unfortunately after a time_ it made me lose 18 pounds and I was already very slim ? 5'10"" inches and size 6.  I looked anorexic and I had to eat like a horse just to maintain my low weight.  It was out of control.",If you need to lose weight_ I might be a great option for you.  I love that it didn't suppress my sex drive .,F,48,30  days 1X D,10/30/2015,Wellbutrin sr
10, 1, Anxiety Depression,"After 18 -you can only put up to 10 on the drop down menu here- 18 years plus on wellbutrin sr and thinking all of the hell I was going through on a daily basis was ME and that this was helping me from being even worse- I stopped taking it because I had extensive dental surgery and found out how it felt to be ""normal""..even happy...",I was put on many SSRIs that did not work. Doctors targeted my depression which was caused by my horrible anxiety. I got stuck with this drug as it is not an ssri as we found out the hard way_ I could not tolerate ssris. People with anxiety READ THIS. 1. Docs are told to rx benzos with wellbutrin because it CAUSES anxiety. 2. Wellbutrin is processed by the body and turned into an AMPHETAMINE!!I started out life as a productive member of society and was turned into a sleepless_ anxiety-ridden zombie reliant on benzos to keep the effects of the wellbutrin in check. Up to 6 mg of ativan. It took my memory_ my patience_ my ability to sleep...everything. If you have anxiety do not even consider this med. It may work for depression_ but  exacerbates anxiety!! Please let my story help you. Docs never told me this during my many hospital stays_ reg. pdoc visits etc. Even though I was in horrible pain from my dental surgery... my mind felt happiness I have not felt in over 20 years once off wellbutrin sr. If you need to taper_ look up how. I didn't. I went back on it two times and that was two times more hell_ nightmares and prayers to God that my body could make it through one more time...I had to be sure wellbutrin was the cause though.Also_ get your hands on Dr. Claire Weekes books_ tapes whatever and listen to them over and over. They will bring you some peace while you recover. She is an angel for people like us! Good luck! Contact me if you want.,F,48,10  years400 MG,10/23/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
11, 4, Depression,I recently started experiencing brain fogginess and dizziness. Three years ago I experienced severe Vertigo with heaving. I attributed this new feeling with that. I was so dizzy at home this weekend I yelled my husband's name and he caught me as I hit the floor.I went to my ENT this morning and after a series of tests_ including one with the audiologist_ he is sure it's the Wellbutrin.  I really don't want to stop it. I need to know if this is normal after one and a half months to first begin. I also now know where my itchiness is coming from after reading comments on this thread.,Will the dizziness and fog end? It began recently_ at least one month after beginning.,F,60,1.5  months150MG 1X D,10/5/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
12, 3, Bipolar depression,dry mouth_ rash_ food taste different_ heart rate fluctuates.,This drug gave me the kick in the ass I needed to start moving. Just felt like I was in a hole with no way out. I started walking on my treadmill and dieting. I am afraid I will be a person with weight gain on this medication. My weight was a factor in my depression. I have such bad dry mouth that at times I find myself biting on the sides of my tongue. I take melatonin to go to sleep. So far so good. I just feel like my eyes hurt and they aren't open enough. So I try to keep them open wide which gives me a headache. Everyone is different with meds. I can tell you as I sit here drinking my tenth bottle of water today that dry mouth is terrible. I am hoping this drug will be successful.,F,37,2  months100 mg,9/10/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
13, 2, Depression_ social phobia,Nausea_ vomiting_ hot flashes accompanied by sweating_ extreme dizziness_ headaches_ decreased appetite_ weight loss.,I was prescribed Wellbutrin SR along with my Prozac and Klonopin_ as my Prozac didn't seem to be helping my depression. After a month of taking this medication_ I'm still experiencing intense side effects. I can't tell if this medication has helped my depression at all. The side effects don't seem like they are going to cease_ and they are almost unbearable.,F,23,1  months200 mg,6/9/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
14, 5, Major depression,None.,Changed my life. I was on cipralex for 8 months with no improvement_ after 2 weeks on wellbutrin I started to feel like myself again.

16, 5, anxiety_ insomnia_ low mood,Slightly increased desire for sweet things and increased appetite but this tapered off over a couple of weeks.After about a month I could sleep again and my concentration iimproved. Anxiety also much better. Didn't actively try to quit smoking but this got me to kick the habit within a month. Only thing is drinking is not a good idea...blackouts. The doctor thinks I may have been misdiagnosed and that my troubles are related to ADD.,This medication has given me back the ability to sleep through the night.It has changed my life.,F,31,3  months150 mg,5/20/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr
17, 1, Bipolar_ Cig Smoking,No side effects_ but this medication was pure crap! Might as well have taken a placebo.,I didn't have any side effects at all but it didn't do a thing for me. My doc kept raising my dose_ still didn't help_ finally told her I refused to keep wasting money on her upping my dose for an ineffective med. I have bipolar and my docs insist I take an anti-depressant even though I am manic type bipolar_ I don't have depression but they insist it will help ease anxiety. It was about as effective as a placebo. Also_ I was told it'd help me quit smoking. Wrong. Went from smoking one pack of cigs every 4 days to smoking almost an entire pack per day. It made me feel like I wasn't getting nicotine at all_ unacceptable to be running outside to smoke every 45 mins.,F,29,42  days50 1X D,5/6/2015Email,Wellbutrin sr

Ringing in ears_ dry mouth_ fast heart beat_ very moody_ angry_ irritable_ no period_ hives_ bad acne_ memory loss_ bad dreams_ isomnia_ depression I never had before_anxious.,My doctor put me on this med even though I felt I did not need it.  I had a health issue that I was concerned about and because I cried in his office he thought I was depressed.  I was no where near depressed.  I was just an extremly busy and overwhelmed professional.  I guess his wife does not work so he has no clue what a motivated woman looks like!

31, 4, Mood Swings And Depression,My Doctor who keeps up with the drugs very well says it's a well known fact that Wellbutrin Generic doesn't work as effectively as the name brand. After doing research I found that Watson brand releases in a very close way as the name brand.  If you are having problems I suggest asking your pharmacy if they can get the Watson brand.  Other manufacturers caused hives and itching horribly.  The only down side to this drug is the increase in heart rate and blood pressure.  It's the best!!  Most anti depressants had horrible side affects for me.,,F,49,2  years150 2x day,4/21/2014Email,Wellbutrin sr

For some reason_ someone does not want the 150 mg pills used.  So I was changed to the 200 mg x 2d pills.  I experienced sever gastritis to the point two doctors said I needed to have my gallbladder removed.  When back to the 150 mg pill and all was fine.

34, 1, Depression-Quit Smoking Aid,Weight gain_ anger_ binge eating_ constipation_ weird dreams,It did help take the edge off smoking_ but the other side effects were too much.

35, 4, Depression_ smoking cessation,Dramatically improves my depression. Improves my lethargy. Improves my sleep from being tired during the day and sleeping 12 to 16 hrs per day to sleeping normally and being able to stay awake all day. Side effects: zyban allergy (cysts under skin and rash on chin -- severity depends on dose)_ homicidal thoughts and aggressive actions_ increased spectrum of feelings especially joy and anger_ irritability and feeling of being out of control like yelling at service people over sometimes insignificant things_ adrenaline rush_ flushing face_ crying when I wake up_ tears when I laugh_ burning pain in head when I'm startled_ panic at the dentist_ ready for a fight_ sexual promiscuity and intense orgasms_ fear of heights_ overstimulation under pressure (like while speaking in public).,Started taking this med for smoking cessation and did quit smoking. I've taken all forms: zyban_ wellbutrin_ and bupropion -- all the same. Stopped this med but started again a few times with no change in effectiveness.  I took Prozac in the past which didn't help much. I only take Wellbutrin and no other medicines except vitamins. I'm normally a calm and mild-mannered person and never experienced such physical anger_ hatred_ or panic as I have on this medicine. Lowering the dose helps. The side effects go away when I stop taking the medicine_ but my depression (sleeping all the time_ feeling of overwhelming sadness) returns. People with any kind of violent or aggressive past shouldn't take it. People who are normally anxious probably shouldn't take it.,F,40,12  years100 2X D,3/10/2014,Wellbutrin sr
36, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Dry mouth_ bad breath_ sleep disruption_ dizziness_ ticks.,This drug really helps my depression.  I've tried coming off it many_ many times.  Though I do succeed_ within one month I'm back on it.  When I do come off_ I sleep much better and feel better immediately_ but my sexual function declines and my weight increases rapidly and eventually the negativity and dark mood return.  After cutting back to 150 mg. per day for 36 days I plan on increasing my dosage again tomorrow.  This time I plan on cutting out the caffeine completely.  Maybe that will cut down on the sleep disruption and the ticks.  Unfortunately_ it looks like I'm on this for life but am unsure about the long-term consequences.  I just need to face it -- depression stinks_ but it beats cancer_ blindness_ deafness_ or going through life without limbs.  In the end_ Wellbutrin does work work for me.  If I'm lucky enough that I can pop a few pills and get it under control it's best just to quit whining_ count my blessings and do it.,M,49,7  years150 mg. 2X D,1/9/2014,Wellbutrin sr

38, 4, depression. add. chronic fatigue,I know add and fatigue don't seem to relate. I don't have add but have symptoms_ scatter brain_ forget everything_etc. Anyways.. Very early. But I was looking for early side effects when I found this site (I have been on several different anti-depressants and know these side effects typically go away.) So far... anxiety. Insomnia. ZERO appetite (and I am a binger). headache. Shakes. Alertness. Yawns are gone! Frequent urinating_ slight nausea (which could be because I can't eat!)... Will update review in a couple weeks!,,F,34,4  days100 mg x 2,11/22/2013Email,Wellbutrin sr
39, 4, Major Depression,Initially: more energy_ need less sleep_ wake up a bit easier_ slight loss of appetite. After a few days: a bit tense_ a bit aggressive and easily upset_ fuzzy head. The last time I took it and after I had stabilized: Almost no side effects. Maybe a slight increase in libido_ slightly more easily agitated and this seemed to correlate with caffeine consumption.,This is my second time taking it. Last time I took a generic Bupropion XL at 300mg/day then 450mg/day when I was continuing to feel depressed. After my body stabilized on the dose I was very comfortable and I feel like the drug would receive a 5 rating. Right now_ however I am readjusting to taking it and it's not a super smooth transition so 4 star for now. I am not sure if SR 1x/day is enough for me but I'm trying to start slowly even though I was in crisis with my depression as of 9 days ago. I may increase to 150mg SR 2x/daily (morning and afternoon) and might be interested in going to XL again at 300mg/day. I've heard it takes 2-3 weeks for your body to adjust to a dose so I'm trying to hold off making changes for the time being. I was really pleased with this drug the last time I took it which was from 2009-2011. I feel like I had the energy and drive to do what I wanted to do with my life then. The last 2 years have been a steady decline in my life. It's hard to tell if it was from being off the drug or from other life issues_ both_ or which caused which. I hope to be charging hard again and since this is about my 4th time having to take an anti-depressant I figure I might be a 'lifer' with drugs now.,M,37,8  days150 1X D,11/13/2013Email,Wellbutrin sr
40, 4, Smoking cessation,At first_ the drug is incredibly disorienting. You sort of feel like your in a dream_ time passes slower_ your face is fuzzy and although you can see what is happening around you_ you can't really analyze the situation itself_ leaving you confused as to what happened. Soon_ you recover_ the side effects wear off_ and the results start to show. After only 5 days_ I bought a pack of cigarettes but realized I no longer found pleasure in smoking. I didn't even finish the cigarette. I'm no longer fighting an urge to smoke because simply there's no longer a desire to fulfill. Best smoking aid I've tried; it puts nicotine patches and gum to shame.,,M,19,5  days150,11/12/2013,Wellbutrin sr
41, 2, depression,,I was taking wellbutrin xl @ 450 mg for a long time without really many issues. Then I ended up having my prescription refilled by another doctor who mistakenly prescribed wellbutrin sr @ 450 mg_ one time daily. I was dealing with a major family crisis that was objectively getting a lot more difficult_ so I just thought that I was more anxious than normal because of that. Go to a new doctor_ and she recognized the error that I was taking pretty much 3x what I should be taking in one dose. It explains problems in concentration during work_ and exhaustion at night. Feel dumb I didn't pick this up. More frustrated that the doctor didn't know to just do the most cursory check.,F,,3  months450 mg 1X D,9/25/2013,Wellbutrin sr

43, 1, Depression_ bipolar,In the beginning it worked well on the 3rd_ I was increased to 450mg_ had a Grand mal seizure_ went to the er. Did all the tests EEG MRI ct scan. Everything came back normal. Neurologist thought it was the saphris_ so my pdoc kept me on it lower to 150mg twice a day. 4months later 2nd grand mal seizure. This time not quite lucky last thing I remember_ I was standing by kitchen top juicing (seizure happening here) then the next thing i remember in a extremely dream state_ I was struggling with someone(my wife) trying to 'escape' to our front door. We struggled to door that's when I start to really come to and realize that person I was struggling with was my wife & she was repeating 'you had a seizure...' Over & over. I sat down in disbelief that it happen for a 2nd time. Went thru the same battery of tests everything was clear. Seizure could only been drug induced the neurologist said.When my pdoc say On a lower dose it is safe. I have no medical history of seizure nor tested positive for being epileptic.It's sad because this was the only drug that was working for me. But it's not worth the risk. It's 1 in every 1000 at low doses that's not a low. And the actual seizure that gets reported is way higher than that. So if you are on it or put on it watch your dosage closely.,,M,32,6  months150mg 2x,9/21/2013Email,Wellbutrin sr

52, 1, Depression_ weight loss,I wanted to quit Lexapro b/c I had gained 50 lbs_ so I asked for Wellbutrin. Switching to Wellbutrin SR was a big mistake. It gave me severe headaches that wouldn't respond to OTC pain relievers_ vertigo-like brain zaps_ and sent my anxiety levels thru the roof. Also made me feel very mean and snappish. After reading more online_ I discovered that many people do not recommend it if you suffer from anxiety. Apparently Lexapro was doing more for my anxiety issues than I had realized. After one week on it_ I called my dr_ who said to give it a few more days. I gave it another week_ but I just couldn't tolerate it any more.,,F,34,2  weeks150 2X D,5/20/2013,Wellbutrin sr
53, 1, Depression,It weakened the effect of the Adderall the first day_ 2nd day I couldn't feel the Adderall at all. 3rd day didn't feel the Adderall and became very nauseated and stayed nauseated for 2 1/2 days. Now I am feeling the Adderall work again since I'm not taking the Wellbutrin SR.,,F,31,3  days100mg,4/23/2013Email,Wellbutrin sr
54, 5, Bipolar II,"I take Wellbutrin_ Lamictal and Klonopin.  I have brain fog_ but I'm not sure which causes it. I have been on Wellbutrin for years and with Lamictal  have been episode free!  My hypomania and depression episodes cycled yearly like clockwork. The depression was what I call the ""not-survivable"" kind.  I would never change this ""cocktail"" no matter how it affects my  memory or concentration.   Generic DID NOT work.",,F,61,10  years450mg,4/14/2013,Wellbutrin sr
55, 5, Depression,Side effects: slight headache for first 2 or 3 days. Other than that nothing else as of yet. This medication is truly wonderful! I used to be such an energetic person_ but last year I had a very short duration of abusing pain meds that I was prescribed for a lot of dental work. The episode was brief thank God and I'm no longer taking any pain meds or any type of illegal drug. However_ I noticed that I was becoming less energetic_ much less_ absolutely no interest in taking any of my friends phone calls_ would stay in and just watch T.V. all the time when I was not working. Sometimes I would not have enough mental or physical energy to take my dog out. I was so depresed and just didn't care about anything at all. WOW!!!! this med has literally changed my life! I am completely myself again and probably better than I've ever felt. I'm so focused with great energy and great mood. I know some people are reporting unfavorable side effects_ I had the headache and some neck discomfort. But_ please give this med a chance if you are experiencing more and or worse side effects_ they do go away. It's very worth it. If you have some trouble sleeping the first few days just take some Melatonin. Please be well and I know this med will work wonderful for you as well!,,F,38,6  days150 x2/day,4/8/2013,Wellbutrin sr

57, 2, Fatigue_ supposed low dopamine,Heightened alertness_ a little jumpy in fact_ slight headache_ sleepless nights. Decided to go off the drug after 2 nights with little sleep. Insomnia has never been a problem for me. Second night after discontinuing the drug I had an almost full night of sleep so it appears to be out of my system. This drug appears to be too strong even after 2 days - worried that continued use may cause permanent dependence or side effects. Going back to taking protein supplement L-Tyrosene which really appears to work at alleviating fatigue and allowing me to exercise at a higer level. This really works well for for gym work especially where I have increased my work rate by 50%.,,M,56,2  days150 2X D,3/21/2013,Wellbutrin sr
58, 4, OCD depression,Loss of appetite_ slight brain fog,This is the only drug that has been prescribed to me that I will take. I have taken this drug on and off for 20. Back in the day when they discovered  this drug helps with smoke cession it' s cost went from 10 dollars a month to 150 a month. At that time I decided to go off of Wellbutrin. After a month without the drug I realized that the drug helped me get out of bed and function in the real world. Without the drug I couldn't hold a conversation with anyone without becoming overwhelmed and anxious. I couldn't leave the house without feeling doom and gloom. My world was turned upside down I must say it  works for me . I have a lot of pains and aches_ sweats. I really can't contribute this to Wellbutrin. I have tried Paxil_ Buspar _ Xanax_ and many assorted drugs that are supposed to help. Wellbutrin is the only one that I can tolerate that works for me  . I am also a smoker and when I am on Wellbutrin I have really cut back a lot. . Yes _ it kills your appetite_ but I am an over eater so it has helped me maintain my weight for 20 years!,F,59,20  years150 2X D,2/23/2013,Wellbutrin sr
59, 5, Inattentive ADD_ depression_ anxiet,"For the first week: felt fine_ a little nauseous_ a couple of crying spells_ sleepiness. Second week: euphoria_ very slight nausea_ a sense of calm and well-being_ some problems focusing. By the third week_ I felt my body adjusting to the medication. Nausea went away_ I noticed I was able to focus better than I had been able to in months_ little things that I'd normally get stressed out about no longer bothered me. By the fourth week_ I noticed a huge difference in my overall mood and attitude. This medication has made a world of a difference in my life. In the past I have taken SSRIs_ which were a COMPLETE nightmare. Then years later I realized most of my depression and anxiety stemmed from being ADD. This realization was a huge breakthrough and set me on the path to the correct treatment. I tried adderall_ which of course helped enormously but I hated that I was so aware of the med itself. I could feel it as soon as it ""kicked"" then is become irritable and tired as it wore off. All day I'd be running around like a coke-head and at night I'd become a zombie. It was an awful feeling. I could focus great! But needed something steady and consistent in my system. My doctor suggested Wellbutrin sr (bupropion sr) - I was willing to give it a shot! And I'm so glad I did! It's been a complete life-saver. I can concentrate better_ but in a more subtle way compared to adderall. I don't experience a ""crash""_ I feel consistent all day and I'm happier and less anxious",,F,31,5  months100mg 2x d,2/17/2013,Wellbutrin sr
