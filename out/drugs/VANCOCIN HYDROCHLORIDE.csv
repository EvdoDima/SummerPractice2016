0, 1, c.diff,It works.  It also kills off a great deal of your good intestinal flora.  I have white coated tongue now for 6 weeks.  I never had it before.  I have 2 ulcers in my small intestines also which started 2 days after stopping vanco.,If you must use this stuff look into the liquid IV.  It has to be compounded but it is only 150 bucks or so.  However the liquid will kill your mouth flora and give you thrush or coated tongue.  Good luck.,M,41,9  days500,6/21/2015,Vancocin hydrochloride
1, 5, C Diff,Vancomycin is a miracle! C Diff literallybput me on my death bed. My blood work was off the charts_ severely dehydrated_ delusional_ fever_ almost convulsions and going to the bathroom with tons of blood and entire colon and intestines swollen to the max. I even developed sepsis and had to stay in the hospital for a week. Flagyl is a waste of time and did nothing for me but give me horrible side effects. Do not let ur doc give u flagyl if u get c diff. Vanco can be very expensive but thank god I have good insurance! Vanco has definately saved my life! I have to stay on it for 8 weeks but I want this bacteria eradicated! Worst experience of my entire life!,Only side effects I have noticed so far are my eyes have been red and itchy a little bit_ feel sleepy at times and my ears feel a little itchy and wierd. Other than that I feel great!,F,32,9  weeks250 mg,1/21/2015Email,Vancocin hydrochloride
2, 5, c.diff,No side effects at all. The first time I came down with this I was given flagyl. Flagyl was one of the worst medications I had ever taken before in my life. SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS..panic_ feeling of numbness on my face_ throat swelling..I felt like I was dying. So my GP put me on Vanco and it worked amazingly! Very expensive but I have great insurance. Thank God for that. I suggest people skip the Flagyl and go straight to the Vanco if you can afford it. Trust me.. you will save yourself a world of misery!!!,,F,36,10  days125 mg,9/22/2014,Vancocin hydrochloride
3, 5, c-diff,BLISS!,"Okay_ it's over $1000... FOR A REASON! I was nearly septic by the time they dxed my c-diff because docs were so busy_ and my symptoms were paradoxical or something? (I didn't sleep AT ALL for 7 days_ even with Ambien! 20mg Ambien. Not even a little sleepy.) So I was pretty bad off when doc saw me bloated out and knew it was c-diff (from earlier course of antibiotics). I hurt everywhere_ was confused_ bloated_ and he told my husband he wasn't sure I'd ""make it"". That bad. A few doses (half a day!) of Vanco_ I fell asleep_ and then I kept getting better fast_ with absolutely NO SIDE EFFECTS except feeling good. (C-diff itself is no fun_ what with having to take care of your colon_ the probiotics_ etc_ but the Vanco made it do-able). I'm colon-healthy now_ 4 months later_ and this stuff was SO GOOD I hadn't wanted to give it up LOL (I was terrified the c-diff would come back). Besides Xanax_ Vanco is like the BEST DRUG I've ever taken for ""fixing"" you without side effects. If you're ever Rxed this_ you are blessed. I hated Big Pharmacos until I needed Vanco this year_ and now_ I keep my mouth shut about medical research. Please keep churning out miracle drugs like this!!! â™¥",F,35,14  days125 4X D,4/19/2014Email,Vancocin hydrochloride

5, 5, C. Diff,None that I noticed.,Vancocin was the only thing that stood between me and being bedridden or worse.  Every time I tried to get off it_ the c. diff. came roaring back.  After doing extensive research I opted for a fecal transplant.  Within two hours of the first enema_ I felt like I was returning to normal.  Sure enough.  The monster c. difff has not returned.  The fecal transplant protocol says to take the Vancocin right up until the day before the first infusion.  I live in Houston_ Texas_ home of one of the largest medical centers in the world.  I could not find a gastroenterologist who would even coach me.  They all said the fecal transplant was the right thing to do but they would have no part in it.  I have read that 39_000 people in the US die every year from c. diff.  Needlessly in my view.  Thank goodness for Vancocin or I would have been one of them.,F,68,2.5  years250 mg 4X D,6/2/2012Email,Vancocin hydrochloride
6, 5, C-Diff,none,Vancocin is the only drug that kept C-Diff in check but my intestinal bacteria was wiped out so asa I went off it_ the C-Diff came back. However_ I was grateful for this drug. I felt normal while on it but it is VERY expensive. Thank goodness for health insurance.,F,55,2  yearsvarious 3X D,9/7/2011Email,Vancocin hydrochloride
7, 5, C-diff,No significant side effects. Occasional slight pain/pressure in left ear_ as others have mentioned_ but no big deal.,"Vancomycin is a terrific drug for C-difficile. I developed a C-diff infection after way too much clindamycin to treat bacterial pneumonia. The diarrhea from the C-diff was relentless_ up to 30 hits a day_ often with no warning. Because the first lab messed up the test_ I didn't get a positive culture for C-diff for two weeks. By the end of that time I was seriously malnourished and so dehydrated my blood pressure dropped 20 points in both numbers_ despite my drinking gallons of Gatorade. My doctors (primary and GI) were pushing Flagyl_ but I have a terror of nausea. Reports on this site gave me the courage to ""just say no"" to Flagyl. I insisted on Vanco and said I would pay for it. My primary doctor_ who has practiced for more than 20 years_ told me he'd never dosed Vanco orally_ and that when given by IV it is ""poison_"" but he agreed to try the capsules. Vanco stopped the diarrhea in two days_ like turning off a light switch_ with no nausea_ no anything. The gastroenterologist who set the dose says it is ""aggressive treatment."" At his urging_ I also took Florastor and will continue to take it indefinitely (easier and cheaper to buy it online). There have been studies that show Florastor decreases the risk of C-diff recurrence. Vanco is ludicrously expensive. My Medicare Rx co-pay was $1_750 for a two-week supply_ though other insurance might do better. I'm not rich_ but to me it was worth every penny. C-diff takes your life away.",F,68,14  days250 mg 4X D,11/18/2010,Vancocin hydrochloride
8, 4, C Diff after Keflex and Augmentin,None_ but saw doctor today and after the initial dose of 20 capsules_ he wants me to take Flagyl.  He put me on Flagyl first and I asked for the Vancocin.  I only took one Flagyl_ then went on Vancocin.,The Vancocin stopped the diarrhea within a day or slowed it down considerable.  C Diff is the worst thing I've ever gone through.  For me_ the expense was worth the cost.,F,72,4  days250 mg 4X D,10/5/2010Email,Vancocin hydrochloride
9, 5, C-Difficile,None :),My doctor switched me to Vancomycin after I couldn't tolerate Flagyl. I felt a world of difference the very day after starting my Vancomycin. I felt worse on Flagly than I did when I was just battling the C-Diff I had acquired from taking Clindamycin.,F,35,7  days250mg 4X D,10/2/2010,Vancocin hydrochloride
10, 5, ,None. GREAT DRUG. IT killed the CDIFF and have been without CDIFF for months. Don't waste your time with Flagyl or let your doctor give you Flagyl since it does not work against CDIFF and has bad side effects.,Make sure you take Florastor as well as a probiotic like VSL when fighting CDIFF. Most doctors are clueless about CDIFF and how to treat it. As you kill the bacteria_ you need to replace it with the good stuff. Vanco rocks. Flagyl is WORSE than CDIFF.,M,52,3  weeks 2X D,9/26/2010,Vancocin hydrochloride
11, 4, C.Diff,No obvious side effects. My ears were doing funny things.,"This is my second round of Vanco (14 days each) but now I am taking it WITH Flagyl...I know_ very sad. I acquired c.diff when my idiot of a gynocologist gave me clindamycin for some ""unknown"" infection. So DON'T TAKE CLINDA UNLESS YOU'RE DYING! I would take the ""unknown"" infection over c.diff any day. Vancomycin works great_ my symptoms disappear when I'm on it but I've had 2 recurrences so far. The ONLY symptom that comes when I'm taking it is my left ear hurts when I swallow my ears generally feel a little different. I've read that back in the day vanco could cause deafness but that that was no longer an issue. Maybe I'm getting an antibiotic ear infection? I don't know.... my thoughts are with anyone who has C.diff_ it has made these past months a living hell.",F,24,14  days500 MG 4X D,8/2/2010,Vancocin hydrochloride

13, 5, cdiff,I had NO side effects. This was an AMAZING drug. SO SO SO much better than FLAGYL!,I took FLAGYL first to try to fight off the cdiff_ but I honestly believe the flagyl was worse than the actual CDIFF. I was on flagyl for a dreadful 10 days_ and it was torture. The side effects of that drug are completely horrific. HOWEVER_ after being put on Vancomycin_ I am very ecstatic to say_ that I had no side effects.,F,24,3  weeks,8/2/2009,Vancocin hydrochloride
14, 5, c diff,None that I can notice I'm happy to say,I switched to vancocin after feeling poisoned to death by the flagyl. take florastor while treating c diff. You need good bugs in your gut ready and waiting to pounce on the c diff spores once they re-emerge_ if you dont you get high relapse rate,F,42,7  days,7/1/2009,Vancocin hydrochloride
15, 4, c difficile,tongue coated white and a lot of gas,It worked for the infection_ but I had many relapses.  The first after 17 days_ then 25_ 30 and so on.,F,54,6  months,1/21/2009,Vancocin hydrochloride
16, 4, C-Diff,I haven't noticed any.  As soon as I switched from Flagyl to Vanco I felt a world of improvement!,I hope this gets rid of my C-Diff and it never comes back!!!!,F,29,10  days,11/25/2008,Vancocin hydrochloride
17, 4, c. diff,Nothing really noticeable.,I couldn't tolerate Flagyll and I thank goodness for Vanco. Problem_ I had a relapse of c. diff within 5 days of being off a 20 day oral Vanco course (and that's after being in hospital for 2 weeks on IV Flagyll and Vanco). So_ I hope this 2nd 20 day course does the trick. Good luck to anyone who has suffered through C. Difficile.,F,51, ,9/18/2008,Vancocin hydrochloride

19, 3, C. Diff,I am a healthcare provider and contracted C. Diff by taking Keflex post-op and working around C. Diff in an ICU unit.  I was started on Flagyl and had an anaphylactic reaction after 5 days of being on it which is rare. I've been on Vancocin for 3 weeks for C. Diff and have been hospitalized twice for dehydration and C. Diff complications.  We're awaiting the sensitivities from my latest culture but looks like I have Vanc resistant C. Diff.  I get bad stomach cramps 30 minutes after taking the vanc and also some heartburn.  Otherwise_ it's been well tolerated.  I take some pain medicine and heartburn medicine that makes me feel better.,,F,30,21  days,3/16/2007,Vancocin hydrochloride
20, 5, c.diff,none at all,Amazing_ after three days (which is normal_ it takes about 3-5days to kick in) I saw relief of my symptoms and was almost normal again.  By the end of the treatment I felt completely better.  Great medication.,F,29,10  days,1/7/2007Email,Vancocin hydrochloride
21, 5, clostridium difficile,,I had to take it twice for recurring c-diff_ and it worked the second time.  No side effects for me_ as other protocols have.  Only take if absolutely needed because this is currently the best hope I've heard of knocking out c-diff.  If over-prescribed or misused_ this will become problematic like all of the other antibiotics potentially.,F,39,10  days,6/27/2006,Vancocin hydrochloride
