0, 5, Bipolar disorder/ depression,positives: sleep better_ stable mood_ not too irritable or crazy =) negatives: water retention/weight gain of about 10lbs_ thin and brittle hair_ hair loss_ acne_ metallic taste in mouth_ sensitive teeth_ dry skin and I sure sweat more.,Have tried to quit this medication a number of times in the last 16 years and it is always a mistake to go off of it for me.,F,33,16  years450mg 2X D,1/29/2016,Eskalith
1, 4, Bipolar,Weight gain- 30lbs_Exhaustion_ Hair falling out_ Acne_Thirst_ Nausea_Diahhrea often.All of these side effects except for weight gain occurred cuz I was on too high of a dose. I have to be on a very high dose because my body flushes out lithium faster than most. I take 1800 mg a day and my blood level is at the lower end of the therapeutic range kind of interesting. If you wxperience hair loss major acne or diahhrea ask your doctor about it cuz you don't wanna get toxic. Anyway most of my side effects are gone now that my dose was lowered. Lithium has been the most helpful medicine yet despite the frustrating side effects,Extremely effective anti manic for me. Had two major 5 month long manic episodes two years in a row and have been fairly stable since. Not as effective for depression but still helps. Been able to get my shit together_ get sober and focus on my future,F,22,2  years1800,1/16/2016,Eskalith
2, 5, Bipolar I,Sedation_ issues with toxicity if I skip a meal_ stomache pain,Works well_ side effects are tiresome as they are with all of the mood stabilisers but overall the drug does it's job.,F,34,1  years,6/27/2009,Eskalith
3, 1, behavior issues,mental slowness_ satanic thoughts_ possible delay of puberty,This stuff was hell for me. . . somewhat literally!  Those thoughts would stick in my head.  Not only that_ but they would corrupt my good thoughts.  I had almost no filter.  I was also numbed to the emotional aspects of good and evil.  The dark side would have seemed just another side of things had it not been for my intellectual knowledge and the grace of God.  I would also be paranoid that gang writing and stuff was satanic.Stay away from those drugs and especially don't drug your kids on them.,F,29,2.5  years,3/27/2009,Eskalith
4, 4, Bipolar I,"Weight gain (165 to 180 inone summer) which is OK_ I am a 6'2"" male and needed the weight.  I didn't use to eat.  Always drinking water and must urinate hourly.  Starting to have high blood pressure and am wondering if it is the lithium.",I put up a big curb on my rage.  Everything used to bother me and piss me off severly.  Now I can still be irritable but can think things throgh enough to not have sudden rage issues.  MADE ME EMPLOYABLE!,M,37,4  times,1/12/2008Email,Eskalith
