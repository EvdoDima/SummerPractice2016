2, 4, Prevent pregnancy,So far I've been pleased. Periods have gotten lighter over the years and the cramps are barely noticeable. Only downside is I've gained 15 pounds. I've noticed an increase in appetite since I began taking them.,,F,18,1  years,8/29/2014,Estrostep 21
3, 5, regulation_ acne_ prevent pregnancy,regulated and lightened my periods. didn't really help clear up acne_ but getting older did. I still get more pimples around the time of my period_ bloating_ and breast swelling/tenderness.,I have PMDD and I don't think this really helps it_ but I've been on it 10 years so I don't know how I would be without it. It has worked to prevent pregnancy for 10 years so I'd say that's pretty good! As a side note_ I tried Orthotricyclen before Estrostep (and I actually take Tilia FE_ the generic) and it was bad bad bad for me. Everyone reacts differently to different birth control pills.,F,27,10  years 1X D,6/9/2014,Estrostep 21
4, 4, acne prevent pregnancy,headaches at night_ tiredness and feeling of being weak and low in energy. at first I was very nauseous all the time and had heightened sense of smell and taste (I was a pickier eater than my 3 year old). Acne never completely cleared up. gained 10 lbs.,Over all this is a good birth control_ I was on Mirena IUD before this for a couple of years which gave me severe acne and increased hair growth. The one thing I liked about Mirena was the increased energy level and no mood swings. Estrostep is completely different_ I feel more womenish (if that makes sense) the hair on my head and eyelashes are actually thicker and my body hair has actually decreased and slowed in growth. My skin actually looks and feels more radiant and less greasy (the hormones in Mirena made my skin produce excess oil). The tiredness and weak feeling is still there I have just gotten used to it_ but the heightened senses have went away.  I have been trying everything for the passed month to lose the 10 lbs I gained but have had no luck. I have never had a problem losing weight until now. I was 125 lbs before I started taking this BC and now I am 135 lbs. I am working out for an hour a day 4 days a week and eating clean an have actually gained a pound. My next step is cleansing my liver of excessive hormones hope it works. The described effects are in comparison to Mirena and the side effects were by no means extraordinary.,F,26,1  years 1X D,2/19/2014Email,Estrostep 21
5, 1, Acne,Extreme vaginal dryness_ increased appetite. Breast tenderness. Spotting,,F,31,2.5  weeks 1X D,5/8/2013Email,Estrostep 21
6, 4, Moderate acne,The worst side effect was that I bled for 3 weeks straight during the first month taking it. I was off birth control pills for about 4 years because my acne got better. It wasn't excessive bleeding (good bleeding for about 1 week_ then spotting for 2 weeks). For the second month_ my period returned to normal.,Great with acne_ I don't have breakouts any more.,F,23,2  months 1X D,4/6/2012Email,Estrostep 21
7, 2, Birth Control and help Acne,Spotting_ Unusually emotional_ Breast pain_ Either very hungry or not hungry at all,Mostly I hated this bc because my period became completely unstable. I normally get it like clockwork every 27 days and this threw it off completely_ I wasn't spotting I was getting a period 3 times a month just shorter. It also made my boobs hurt REALLY badly_ sad I was hoping it would work out.,F,21,2.5  months20 1X D,2/1/2012Email,Estrostep 21
8, 5, Prevent pregnancy_ control PMS,Altered period cycle -- almost all of my PMS symptoms (cramps_ zits) occur the week BEFORE my period now. Period length was not shortened as much as other oral contraceptives have shortened it.,This was the ONLY pill that did not make me fat. Yaz and Ortho Tri Cyclen both made me go from 118 lbs to 140 lbs over the course of months. This BC allowed me to shed the weight immediately back down to 121 lbs. Helped control mood swings tremendously. Helped acne (except while on period). Helped cramps. Only downside -- period was not shortened or lightened as much as other BCs have and this pill is expensive (co-pay tends to run high_ $25 for me_ even for generic).,F,18,1  years 1X D,12/12/2011,Estrostep 21
9, 1, Endometriosis,Wanted to put a gun to my head and blow my brians out. Cried over everything and nothing.  Became evil towards family and friends.,My GYN had switched me because I had been on the same pill since my endometriosis surgery two years prior and she wanted to make sure my system was maintaining. I finally realized_ after having such a horrendous argument with my mother that I blacked out I was so angry_ that it had to be this pill.  It was like being possessed! I have never had such erratic mood swings and crying jags.  It was a horrible_ horrible month_ especially the week before my period.  Went directly back on previous pill and have been too frightened to try anything else.,F,43,30  daysFE 1X D,9/25/2011,Estrostep 21
10, 4, Lower estrogen birth control,first week i experienced numbness/tingling in arms and legs but this stopped the second week. start of third week i have been experiencing constant breast tenderness_ very vivid dreams the entire month.,I switched to this bc because i was on ortho-tricyclen for several years and i had a lowered libido and frequently yeast infections. Although i have not had my period yet on this new bc i can say that i am happy with the switch. my breasts are sore and the vivid dreams are a bit annoying but i like some of the other effects. i have improved mood_ less constipation_ slightly higher libido and no yeast infection. it is amazing how switching pills can change problems that you never knew were associated with the pill. i would recommend this pill to women who are curious if higher estrogen might be behind some of their problems. I will update more after my period next week to give a full review of this product. So far though_ i am happy with it.,F,24,3  weeks20_25_30 1X D,2/22/2011Email,Estrostep 21
11, 3, Prevent Pregnancy,Negatives: Weight gain of 5-7 lbs so far. Breast size increase and constant tenderness. Slightly more tired. Major decrease in sex drive. Positives: Wonderful during period: No cramps_ small headaches only 1 or 2 days_ didn't make me nausated like most birth controls. (Was on generic Tilia Fe the first month and I would NOT suggest that to anyone. Constant headaches/migraines the WHOLE month I was on it. And an increase in anxiety; slight depression; more moody.,I was on the Nuvaring for 6 months and it was WONDERFUL! No side effects at all except extra discharge and shorter lighter periods. I had a slight discomfort during intercourse and knew mutliple people who had gotten pregnant while on nuvaring so I switched to Estrostep. I am going to continue it and I think my body will adjust for the most part_ and working out will take care of the weight gain.,F,23,2  months 1X D,2/4/2011,Estrostep 21
12, 1, prevent pregnancy,Crippling anxiety! This BC messed up so much_ and I've tried several brands of hormonal BC. The anxiety and panic attacks stopped me from going about my life and eventually gave me IBS that I still have 5 years later. The month after I stopped taking the pills my anxiety levels went back to normal (but my stomach never did),Wish I had never tried it!!,F,26,3  months 1X D,1/31/2011,Estrostep 21
13, 3, regulate period,im 5ft3 and when i started taking it i weighed 120 and i am now 131..my boobs hurt so very bad to the point im going to call my dr to complain in the morning. im still in my 34d bra but i could probably use the next size up but i refuse to buy a new bra:) its not my entire boob that hurts just the outer part almost like they are growing full speed ahead:)my face is broke out really bad but my chest and back that use to be bad is as clear as a bell now:)go figure. im tired and forgetful all the time now. seem confused alot and my husband says im more moody. a real bitch according to him:)but guess what..it regulated my period_ comes like clockwork now but is it really worth all the other side effects??? I THINK NOT!!!!!,WEIGHT GAIN_ MOODY_ FORGETFUL_ TIRED ALL THE TIME,F,30,2  months 1X D,1/30/2011Email,Estrostep 21
14, 5, Birth Control,Extreme hunger the week before a period.,I have used Estrostep off and on for the last 6.5 years.  I have had nothing but good results with it.  It decreased the severity of my cramps (I use to vomit due to the pain)_ I knew exactly what day I would get my period_ my skin was clear_ and I didn't get pregnant while on it.  I did switch to Mercett for 1 year to see if the B/C pills were causing my migraines (Turns out they weren't). The Mercett didn't even compare to Estrostep.  I will be using it for as long as I can.,F,25,6.5  years 1X D,9/27/2010,Estrostep 21
15, 2, For Pregnancy Prevention,weight gain_ depression_ moodiness_ skipped period (or withdrawal bleeding i guess it's technically called)_ severe headaches_ lethargy_ upset stomach_ stomach pain_ sore breasts_ very very stingy sore nipples (sucked real bad),i was on lutera (generic for allesse) for two years and never had any bad side effects_ until it stopped controlling my bleeding so i switched to the estrostep.  after the first month on estrostep fe's generic (tilia)_ i had bleeding for a day or two_ after the second month_ i had no period at all.  i've taken a dozen preg tests_ all negative.  the headaches occur all through the month but the worst seem to fall in the third week of pills_ they are so bad i can't do anything other than lie down and cry. i've been depressed and lack interest in most things around me.  my sleeping habits have gotten messed up too_ i find it hard to get to sleep but once i do_ i find it even more difficult to get up.  the sore boobs and nippies didnt' start until i began this third month pack of bc_ that was two weeks ago_ the nippie burn has subsided and my breast aren't as sore as they were last week.  i have had some mild cramping sensations as well.  oh_ and a yeast infection that just won't quit.  i really don't like this pill but i'm hoping these side effects will clear up after a while.,F,30,2.5  months 1X D,7/12/2010,Estrostep 21
16, 5, Prevent pregnancy_ acne,Weight gain_ some hair loss,This is by far the best birth control I've been on. I started on Ortho-Evra and HATED it. Went to Estrostep and loved it. Then I got Tilia (Estrostep's generic) to save money and went right back to Estrostep. Tilia made me super depressed and have frequent suicidial thoughts. No thanks! Estrostep keeps my libido good_ my acne under control_ and my periods light and regular. I would recommend Estrostep to anyone.,F,33,3  years 1X D,6/29/2010Email,Estrostep 21
17, 1, Birth control,No sex driveWeight Gain_ 20 lbs in the last 2 years.  I worked my ass off the first 3 years in order to maintain my weight.Cry over anything (I hated moody women and promised I would never be moody).  I am in bad shape today.  I cry_ get angry_ don't want to leave the house_ I do not like the person I have become_ even though I am very successful at my job and my relationship is wonderful_ but I fight with my emotions everyday.,,F,27,5  years,12/30/2009,Estrostep 21
18, 3, birth control,weight gain; missed a period_ spotting and deceased sex drive,I was very worried when i missed my period and 2 weeks later i started spotting.  My doctor said i was getting use to it. I've gained 15lbs in 3 mos but thats a good thing for me.. I like being thicker.,M,24,3  months,12/18/2009,Estrostep 21
19, 4, birth control and acne,much shorter_ lighter periods_ mild cramping,I am very happy with this pill_ I have been on Yasmin and Yaz before switching to this to try and help with my acne. My acne hasn't improved or worsened_ but my periods are super light and short with mild to severe cramps on the first day or two.,F,21,2  years,11/6/2009,Estrostep 21
20, 4, birth control and regulate period,weight gain. i have gained about 15 lbs in the two years i've taken it. also had an increase in facial hair. and moodiness is heightened for me during pms time - which i never had an issue with before.,the upside: it caused my periods to be like clockwork when they were never even close to regular_ before estrostep. also_ have had much less intense cramping (used to be so bad i'd pass out)_ and my periods are much lighter.,F,29,3  years,9/8/2009,Estrostep 21
21, 4," As a ""vaccination"" to ovarian cance",Increased breast size_ 20 lbs weight gain_ decreased sex drive,I was advised by my OBGYN to take E due to family risk of ovarian cancer. She told me that 10 years on E would drastically reduce my cancer risk. I like the drug with the exception of the weight gain.,F,48,9  days,7/21/2009,Estrostep 21
22, 5, Prevent Pregnancy,Zero sex drive,I have been on this birth control for 8 years and overall_ I would recommend it to anyone.  Not going to lie_ the first 4 - 6 months were rough: I was nauseous all the time_ I lost a 10 pounds (went from 120 to 110)_ and had spotting.  Once my body got used to it_ the drug was a miracle - very light periods at the same hour each month.  Major downside - I have absolutely no sex drive and I really believe it is because of the birth control.,F,25,8  years,7/6/2009,Estrostep 21
23, 2, Birth Control,"very slight weight gain_ cramps during period_ extremely low sex drive during the ""white pills"" but felt like i was in heat during ""placebo-pills""-week (i never actually took the placebos though.) Pain during sex (deep pain_ near cervix probably)_ slight bleeding after sex. Need more sleep than usual.",I was on Orthotricyclin Lo before_ but it was getting too expensive for me_ so my doc at school recommended estrostep. I'm hoping that my body will get used to it by the 3rd month. if not_ i'm definitely switchin pills again. i'm getting way too many negative side effects from this pill...orthotricyclin NEVER gave me weird/bad side effects.,F,21,1.5  months,5/16/2009,Estrostep 21
24, 5, Birth control,The first month_ I had horrible diarrhea and stomach cramps when I went on the placebo week_ but I'm now thinking it was unrelated to the pills_ and just a coincidence. I stopped taking the placebo iron pills just in case_ and the problem never returned.,My boobs got huge! Again_ could just be a coincidence_ but I went from a 34B to a 34D in 2 months. Not complaining though! Also_ my sex life is greatly improved - I'm in the mood more often_ and orgasm more easily. Hooray!,F,19,3  months,5/7/2009,Estrostep 21
25, 3, control symptoms of endometriosis,increase in facial hair_ weight gain_ increase in blood pressure_ change in vision_ thinning scalp hair_ lots of yeast infections that were hard to get rid of,I take this BC pill continously for endometriosis. I loved that I did not have extreme mood swings around my period time anymore. I did not have anymore horrible cramps at all. It helped some with my acne_ but I still have quite a bit of acne.,F,34,3.5  years,4/6/2009,Estrostep 21
26, 5, mainly help with severe pms,all positive effects - had the least weight gain. Only one concern - does taking it for a long period of time have negative effects. I am afraid to go off of it because my psychological well being is really important.,I needed a pill to regulate my periods and help ease the severe emotional drama that came 2 weeks before my period. My emotional upheaval would effect my children and my husband. I wound up feeling guilty all of the time. Estrostep took away all of the emotional problems.,F,44,15  years,1/9/2009,Estrostep 21
27, 5, Birth Control,"At first mood-swings_ now increased confidence and high levels of self-assurance_ weight gain (20 lbs in 10 years)_ positive personality changes (I feel very ""motherly"" towards just about anyone)_ emotional at times_ migrane once a month.",Well_ I've been on this for 10 years and it definitely prevents pregnancy.  It also has caused me some positive side-effects (increased confidence and kindness towards others) and negative side-effects (major weight gain and a migrane once a month).,F,29,10  years,12/29/2008,Estrostep 21
28, 4, prevent pregnancy,Increased discharge_ frequent spotting_ a few missed periods.,No change in my moderate acne_ unfortunately. Slight weight gain that could have been many other factors in my life. No real breast increase. I always spot about a week after my period for 2-3 days. Gyno says it's normal and doesn't bother me too much. But lately my periods have been coming later and later during the inactive pill week and sometimes haven't come at all_ which is very worrisome. No mood changes_ very high sex drive_ can't complain too much.,F,22,4  years,12/19/2008,Estrostep 21
29, 2, Birth contol,Nausea_ bladder infections_ mood swings,The pill worked fabulously the first month - I lost about 10 pounds_ had no nausea or headaches.  But after that_ it's gone downhill.  The second month I started getting recurrent bladder infections and the last two months_ once I start the last set of active pills_ I can count on being nausated in the morning_ if not during the whole day.  What started out great kind of backfired...,F,22,4  weeks,11/17/2008,Estrostep 21
30, 4, Birth Control,Major weight gain in the first 3 months_ I went from 120 to 145.  I have since been on this pill for 2 years and 3 months with no problems_ and I've managed to take and keep most of the weight off.  My emotions were crazy for the first 6 months_ but everything regulated itself and I feel more like me again.,I'd reccomend this brand.,F,21,2  years,9/11/2008,Estrostep 21
31, 3, Endometriosis,Moodiness_ cramping in legs while sleeping_ increase in anger/easily upset.,This pill wasn't horrible_ but it did mess with my emotions. I have always been sensitive and can get upset easily_ but I feel like Estrostep made it even worse. I also got angry much easier too. The strangest thing was my legs cramping up at night. It would happen at random times while lying in bed and would really hurt. I noticed it in my upper thighs mostly_ but often the entire leg. I have since switched to LoEstrin24 and am feeling much better. Getting more headaches on this one_ not sure if that is why though.,F,21,1  years,7/29/2008,Estrostep 21
32, 4, Birth Control,mild moodiness_ dry skin/ eyes_ heavy breakthrough bleeding,Estrostep Fe is hands-down the best birth control I've ever been on.  This first time I was on BC_ I tried Ovcon.  Then I switched to Balziva (THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE).  On the advice from a friend_ I tried Estrostep.  I do not have the extream moodiness that I had on the other 2 pills_ or any weight gain.  I weigh the same today as I did when I started taking it. I do have breakthrough bleeding_ but I have experinced this will other pills.  My regular periods are so light_ I feel like I can handle the breakthrough bleeding.  Over all_ its a great pill!,F,25,4  months,7/4/2008,Estrostep 21
33, 3, birth control_ ovarian cyst,depression_ lethargy_ weight gain,This is the only bc pill I've ever taken_ and I've taken it mostly regularly for almost a decade now.  The first 7 years I was on it_ I would have given it a 5.  My periods were lighter_ regular_ hardly any cramping.  However_ in past two years_ went off it for stretches and noticed that I had way more energy_ lost about 5 pounds each time_ etc.  Have finally just asked my doctor about switching to something else_ though am worried that any other pill will be just as bad w/side effects...,F,28, ,7/3/2008,Estrostep 21
34, 5, birth control/endometriosis,Possible weight gain (5 lbs),I've been on Estrostep FE for 8 years.  It's the only BCP that I've ever tried.  I love it!!  I used to have awful cramps and very heavy periods.  My period are practically non-existent and I don't have any cramping at all.  My skin looks great_ too.  The only complaint that I have is a possible 5 lb weight gain_ which is all in my stomach.,F,31,8  years,4/10/2008,Estrostep 21
35, 3, birth control,large appetite all the time,i loved how light my periods were and how i always knew when they were going to be_ HOWEVER_ while on estrostep i've gained around 15 pounds and always have the appetite of a 300 pound man!!! It's really great to know that i'm not the only one who has had this problem with it...,F,21,2.5  years,2/28/2008,Estrostep 21
36, 2, birth control,hair loss_ mood swings,,F,33,8  months,2/28/2008,Estrostep 21
37, 5, pregnancy preventtion_ acne,,I LOVED this pill. I never had any PMS and periods were light and very predictable. Unfortunatly_ it is expensive and w/out insurance anymore Doc suggested I try another one. Tried OrthoTriLo and have a lot of symptoms. Trying Loestrin 24. We'll see how that goes. I may end up switching back to Estrostep.,F,24,8  years,2/27/2008,Estrostep 21
38, 3, I have cyst,I get migranes and the medicine makes it worse.,I don't really get my period when being on the medicine. Barely any pain and any side effedcts. Great pill exceot for the migranes and weight gain!!,F,20,3  years,1/24/2008,Estrostep 21
39, 3, Prevent Pregnancy,I've been on Estrostep for about 2 years and I've gained a ton of weight. I've missed my period a bunch of times - once for 2.5 months when I was sixteen_ that was scary... currently in my second missed month_ already taken 2 tests and both negative but still nervous. Not fun. I'm moody and incredibly lethargic (probably due to my intense weight gain...)I could sleep for days on end without a thought. This is my only b/c I've ever tried but I think I want to switch.,,F,18,2  years,1/22/2008,Estrostep 21
40, 1, birth control,Extreme depression_ moodiness_ crying often_ Very hungry_ anxiety_ tired all the time_ can't sleep_ caused acne (when I didn't have any to begin with)_ have hot flashes where my skin gets red then goes away.,I have never had such bad side effects.  Since this is the completion of my first month_ I will try a second month to see if there are any changes_ but will be seriously changing to a different medicine if things don't improve.,F,30,28  days,1/8/2008,Estrostep 21
41, 5, acne,I was taking these pills last year and they were working well for me. I had mild acne as soon as I turned 21 so I decided to take the Estrostep. My acne started clearing up for me and I was also gaining weight. Yeah_ I know most people won't think that's an advantage_ but for me it was. I was 5'3'' and weighted about 115. As soon as I started taking these pills I went up to 135 and looked great with a clean and clear face.,I have one problem. I'm pretty possitive these are the pills I was taking last year_ but I want to make sure. For those of you who took these pills last year_ did they come in a pink/purple box and said With Acne Contraceptive on the top of the box? I stopped taking these pills about the beginning of this year and can't seem to find them_ of course til now on the internet.Thanks,F,22,6  months,12/23/2007,Estrostep 21
42, 5, birthcontrol/ lessen period length,i have never had any bad side effects.,Wonderful_ a little expensive compared to other birth control pills_ however it is well worth the money for me.  I have been on estrostep for 3 years and love it!  Never would change... before this i was on ovcon 35 and i was getting extremely sick.  Estrostep is the way to go,F,19,3  years,12/14/2007,Estrostep 21
43, 5, acne_eliminate cramps_birthcontrol,It was wonderful_ I have tried the depo_ estrostep_ and also ortho.This birth control made my periods seem obsolete_ i only bled for one or two days_ no cramps_ no acne (which i battle)_ and NO MOOD SWINGS!! I even lost about 15lbs while on this birth control. The only reason why i switched was due to a loss in insurance_ so the health department gave me ortho and depo.my hair fell out with the ortho pills_ and i gained about 5 lbs.NEVER get the depo.its poisen. I have gained 2olbs. which is alot for my small frame.estrostep is heaven compared to that shot..id rather bleed for two days out of the month than turn into a fat and manly woman (hair growth increased w/ depo too!) Oh and imagine how that affects the sex drive! (blah)I cannot wait to get back on estrostep birth control!!!!!!,i took this BC when i was 16 until i was 18..ortho for about two moths...depo for about 4 months now.,F,20,2  years,12/13/2007,Estrostep 21
44, 4, Birth Control/Heavy Flow,Minimal side effects,I have been really happy with Estrostep_ however I have never been on any other form of birth control_ so I have nothing to compare it to.  Before I was on it_ I had really heavy flow_ after the first month of taking it_ my monthly flow has been really light.  I never experienced any of the weight gain or massive breakouts that others have experience_ in fact I experience the opposite.  I've always had a problem with acne_ and this pill have completely cleared my face_ with an exception to one or two pimples during the week i'm on my period.,F,28,1.5  years,10/26/2007,Estrostep 21
45, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,Extreme moodiness_ highly emotional_ inability to cope with stressful situations_ cramping_ low sex drive,This was the first birth control I tried.  It was prescribed by my GYN and I didn't question the prescription.  The extreme moodiness has caused problems at work and at home.  Before starting on the pill_ I never had PMS type symptoms and now it is like clockwork.  The one advantage has been timing as my periods were never regular before.  I would very cautious if I were prescribed this pill.,F,24,3  years,10/21/2007,Estrostep 21
46, 4, Birth Control,The only complaint was longer periods (five days instead of four) but for the most part_ it was fine. I lost weight easier and had little to no cramps. Migraines were slightly harder to kill but it was mad accurate as to when my period was about to start.,,F,21,2  years,9/25/2007,Estrostep 21
47, 5, To prevent pregnancy,sore breast about (3 days),Estrostep is great i've been taking it now for 8yrs. I've tried lots of birth control over the years that have made me sick to my stomach but this is great. I take it every night about 10pm. The only side affect i've experienced is sore breast for a couple of days. I would rather have sore breast for 2-3 days than feeling nausea. My period is more comfortable and my skin is great. It actually has also made me want to have sex more. So overall its a great pill.,F,25,8  years,9/24/2007,Estrostep 21
48, 1, Regulate perioods,Horrible side effects! Bled for a whole month_ didn't get my period for 7 months after that_ gained 15 lbs_ vomiting_ horrible depression/mood swings_ NO sex drive whatsoever. Bad acne flair ups. It's been 6 years and I'm horrified to try another pill because my 1st experience was so bad.,,M,20,8  months,9/17/2007,Estrostep 21
49, 3, Regulate mood swings and cycle,Very effective for mood swings and cycle regulation_ but have noticed increased migraines_ vaginal dryness and extremely low sex drive.,,F,45,5  years,9/11/2007,Estrostep 21
50, 5, birth control,None,I have tried two different 'traditional' estrogen focused BCP and they gave me horrible side effects.  I was severely depressed_ irrational_ lost my entire sex drive_ and gained a bit of weight on the other pills.  My doctor suggested Estrostep as an alternative_ since it does focus more on progesterin more than estrogen.  I've been on it for going on three years now_ and it's amazing.  My periods are to the minute_ almost_ and my PMS symptoms are almost gone.  My libido is back up to a normal level and I don't *feel* as if I am taking a medication_ which should be the goal of any medication/treatment. I know a lot of you are bashing this pill_ but all of our bodies are different.  What works for most women (Ortho Tri) was the absolute pits for me.  Remember to each their own!,F,22,3  years,9/2/2007,Estrostep 21
51, 3, control cramps and bleeding,break-through bleeding (for almost 2 weeks each month)_ very low sex-drive the week or so before my period_ and mood swings.,I have experienced very bad break-through bleeding since the first month on this pill; sometimes it is even heavier than my period.  Also_ I never used to PMS that badly when I wasn't on the pill_ and now my mood swings the week or so before my period are horrible.  I actually threw out my Estrostep tonight because I couldn't deal with how it was making me feel.  My doctor just prescribed Femcon FE to me to fix these problems and I can't wait to start it.  However_ the Estrostep did make my period a lot more managable...2 days instead of 5_ and much better cramps.,M,19,7  months,6/21/2007,Estrostep 21

53, 3, birth control,Anxiety_ depression_ mood swings_ migraines and breast tenderness,I have been taking Estrostep for about 5 months now. At first I felt great and didn't really feel many symptoms except for my boobs being really sore. But about up till a month ago I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety. I'm not sure if it's directly related to this pill but I don't know what else it could be. After reading other women's comments about anxiety related to this pill it makes me feel so much better that I'm not alone.,F,26,5  months,6/17/2007,Estrostep 21
54, 4, As a birth control method,The only side effects I may have experienced was mild weight gain_ if any_ maybe a couple pounds. Some irritability_ depression.,Estrostep has been pretty good for me. I used to have horrible long_ painful menstrual cycles. When I began the pill after a few months my periods have shortened to about 4 days. They are light and almost cramp free. I am also on a schedule. I know the exact day my period is coming. Most of the time it has done a great job in managing my acne except in times that I am under a great deal of stress. I could have possibly gained a few pounds but it could have also been from my diet. I do notice irritability at times and also times of depression that could be an effect of the pill. I would still recomend estrostep it has been reliable and very helpful.,F,18,2  years,6/11/2007Email,Estrostep 21
55, 5, birth control,I really have not had any side effects.,I have been on it for 2 1/2 years now and I have had absolutely no problems. I have had very minimal cramps_ 3-4 day light periods which are very regular_ no spotting_ slight breast enlargement and weight gain which may or may not be connected. I love it. All of the horrible stories I had heard from friends on the pill never happened. It's great.,F,23,2.5  years,6/9/2007,Estrostep 21
56, 4, birth control_ to regulate periods,Small amount of weight gain_ occasional bleeding between periods,It really helped regulate my periods. Before I started on it I never knew when my period was going to come. And my periods were also really heavy and really long with awful cramping_ also I had problems with throwing up right around the time my period would start. Now that I am on Estrostep I still get some cramping but it is very manageable with a few Tylenol. No more puking either. I have gained about 5 pounds but I don't know if this is a result of the pill itself or the fact that I'm no longer throwing up 3 days out of every month. Occasionally I'll have spotting between periods but it's only about twice a year and doesn't last long so it's not too annoying. My doctor said Estrostep would help to clear up acne that I had on my back and shoulders but it really didn't. But overall Estrostep has been good for me at least and my periods are a lot more manageable now_ and I'm also not pregnant!,F,22,3  years,5/22/2007,Estrostep 21
57, 2, prevent ovarian cysts,I have had the same horrible weight gain as many other people! I've never had a problem with my weight and now after being on this pill for a little over a month - I have gained 8 pounds. I don't even eat that much and I can never lose any weight! In addition_ I feel tired all of the time and very moody. I am going off of this pill at the end of this cycle. ,,F,46,2  months,5/14/2007,Estrostep 21
58, 4, regulate_ birth control,Cleared up stress acne_ some breast enlargement (didn't give me back what I had before nursing 2 children)_ cry easier_ shortened period from 7-14 days to 3-5 days & regulated to every 28 days.,,F,30,2  years,4/20/2007,Estrostep 21
59, 5, birth control.,*** (meant to put years for the last one) I used to have terrible acne_ and I'm allergic to the benzoclyn found in many acne products_ so creams were almost out of the question.  I was also pretty irregular.  I'd go almost 5 months without a period.  But within 3 months of taking Estrostep_ my acne had been greatly healed and my periods were starting to regulate.  My cramps also became lighter and much easier to handle.  I did_ however_ get nauseus on a daily basis_ so I had to switch to taking the pill at night.  Other than that_ I haven't had any problems.,,F,16,1  years,4/18/2007,Estrostep 21

61, 4, birth control,longer periods,I got on Estrostep after an unplanned pregnancy. It was smooth sailing for about 4 months then I started having longer periods. Bleeding for 7 days instead of the usual 4 or 5. Then it progressed to the point that I was bleeding 3 WEEKS out of every month! I pretty much had clear skin before I started Estrostep_ but after I started taking it- I did not even get the monthly premenstral breakouts. My sex drive was fine - when I could have sex- the one week a month I wasn't on my cycle.,F,28,4  months,4/2/2007,Estrostep 21
62, 1, acne /pregancy prevention,I totaly despise this product !!!!!!!!!! I just had a baby 3 months ago I had started to lose the baby weight immediatly I felt great all smooth sailing . Started taking this about two months now_ I stopped losing weight immediatly and have gained 7 lbs already all on the abdomen area. I also started to take this as a acne prevention thanks to estrostep you can now play connect the dots on my face due to the acne breakout I also experienced really bad leg cramps and arm cramps as if poor circulation. I really would not recommend anyone to use this product worse thing that I have ever tried. Thanks to this I feel and look horrible.,,F,29,2  months,3/29/2007,Estrostep 21
63, 5, To help clear acne.,None. Well_ actually MAYBE. For a while_ I seemed to be having more discharge than before I started taking the pill_ but my gynecologist said I'm perfectly fine. And that problem has pretty much gone away; I feel just fine_ physically. Emotionally... I don't know if it's due to taking Estrostep or just being a teenager_ but I have had some pretty bad ups and downs.,A lot of women here are totally bashing Estrostep Fe... I'm sorry to hear so many people had bad experiences. In my case_ I haven't really experienced any negative side effects that I can definitely attribute to Estrostep. Some women are also saying their breasts got bigger after taking Estrostep. I WISH. The original reason I started taking Estrostep was to help my acne... but it doesn't seem to have helped. On the other hand_ I don't think taking Estrostep has made it worse. I happened to become sexually active AFTER I started the pill_ so I guess I was glad I was already on it. Well... at least I have no libido problems... I want my boyfriend just as much as he wants me lol All in all_ I'm happy with Estrostep Fe.,F,18,1  years,3/24/2007,Estrostep 21
64, 1, so I won't get pregnant,severe cramping_ extreme fatigue_ excessive hunger_ loss of sex drive_ weight gain_ mild psychosis..lol,I hate it!!!!!! I'm switching today!!!!!!!! this is the worst pill ever. I was put on it after the birth of my son and I was already experiencing mild post-partom depression and it just made it worse. Plus I can't seem to lose any weight whatsoever and I'm a maniac all the time. I have zero energy to even play with my son when I get home. I HATE IT!!!!!,F,22,1  years,3/21/2007,Estrostep 21
65, 1, Birth control,Estrostep FE made me a crazy person... irritable_ rude_ and on an angry rampage.  I didn't even recognize myself for the few months I was on Estrostep.,People should note that the progestin in Estrostep is high in androgens (male hormones).  This can cause some people to grow excess hair and have bad acne.  It is probably also related to the bad mood swings people experience on Estrostep.  I ended up switching to Ortho Tri-Cyclen and have been doing great on that for years.  I have no idea why my former doctor EVER prescribed Estrostep to me.  Women should all know about the hormones in their pills!!!  This is a good website about the hormone contents in various birth control pills and their effects: http://www.wdxcyber.com/ncontr13.htm,F,27,3  months,3/21/2007,Estrostep 21

67, 1, birth control,I thought that something was really wrong with me the way sex was really hurting so bad but it was my birth control making me have no sex drive.  I'm very disappointed now after I went thru the weight gain and all the factors that you normally go thru with birth control.,,F,27,2  years,3/13/2007,Estrostep 21
68, 4, very bad PMS_ to regulate my period,The first month was pretty bad_ but not quite as bad as my worst PMS. Before I started taking it_ PMS caused me to become very angry_ sometimes even violent_ along with physical symptoms_ to the point where my family couldn't handle it any more. I cried alot/had mood swings the first month_ but I've leveled off since then. I have gained weight recently_ but I'm not sure it's related,It's definitely helped to alleviate my PMS symptoms and regulate my period. I rarely ever get cramps_ my mood swings have improved significantly_ and my period is now very light and more managable. I spot occasionally_ but it's not a serious problem,F,16,6  months,3/2/2007,Estrostep 21
69, 5, to prevent pregnancy,none.,I started Estrostep after quitting  Ortho-trycyclin (which made me want only to sleep and eat and never ever want to have sex --funny_ huh).  I take it right before bed_ which alleviates any minor feelings of upset stomach or tired feelings.,F,36,10  years,2/20/2007,Estrostep 21
70, 4, birth control,increased appetite about a week before my period...i could eat for hours and never get full_ no need to sleep 3 days before my period_ feeling anxious/crazy/moody,I switched from orthotricyclen because i started bleeding in the middle of my cycle. In the beginning this pill made me feel crazy. I'd have extreme highs and lows but only for the first few months. I noticed afterwards that about a week before my period I could eat incessantly and never be full_ but during my period I pick at my food. A few days before my period I don't require any sleep. I think it might be when my horomones are changing or something. In the beginning it lightened my periods but never shortened them. For the past few months I've had a mini period during the second week of pills. Going to have to talk to the gyno bout that one!,F,21,2  years,2/13/2007,Estrostep 21
71, 2, Birth Control,weight gain (NOT NORMAL FOR ME AT ALL)_ fatigue_ mood swings_ irritable,I am an extremely active individual_ and this drug has caused me to gain about 8-10 llbs on my 5 foot body_ a lot of it has settled on my stomach. I have also noticed that I am tired ALL the time and don't feel like doing any of the normal activities in my day to day life. I have also become rather anti-social_ and I am a social butterfly. I am getting off this pill ASAP! I just hope I can lose the weight I have gained before my wedding in June b/c my dress sure isn't going to fit if I don't!,F,23,2  months,2/12/2007,Estrostep 21
72, 5, Birth Control,Weight gain_more manegable(almost no cramps) and shorter period. Light(amt) really dark menstrual flow.,Love it_ my doctor covers some of the fees but it has recently gone up in price. I believe in sticking with one drug so I do not think I will change. I recently stopped the pill for 3 months and now I'm going to try it again. I stopped because I just didnt have the money at the time not for any illness or problems with Estrostep.,F,21,6  months,2/11/2007,Estrostep 21
73, 4, control cramps and bleeding,The only things I experienced was some weight gain (but that also could be because I'm a college student) and increase in breast size.  But I'm not complaining about the increase in breast size.,Since being put on this medication at 17_ I have had a very easy and light period compared to what it was before.  I know a lot of friends are more common birth controls but I have never had the problems they do.,F,20,2  years,1/22/2007,Estrostep 21
74, 5, Cramps_ mood swings_ heavy flow,lighter and shorter period_ cramps almost disappeared_ skin cleared up drastically_ breasts grew.,I didn't ever have terrible skin but now i don't even wear concealer_ I didn't gain weight (yay!)_ my boobs grew a full cupsize (double-yay!)_ and I'm in love with Estrostep.I used to have to leave class to take care of feminine needs every hour but now i can go most of the day without worrying_ which is especially good for vacation and sports.No loss in sex drive to report.,F,17,10  months,1/18/2007,Estrostep 21

77, 4, birth control,over the last few months there has been a loss of sex drive_ it had always caused serious mood swings(when before i was on it i NEVER experienced pms),regulated my period and made the cramps disappear for the most part,F,20,2  years,1/8/2007,Estrostep 21
78, 5, Period regulation_ birth control,Increased appetite_ five pound weight loss/gain_ very light period_ has helped cramps a LOT,I have not had a decrease in sex drive (I'm also on 20 mg Prozac for dysthymic disorder) and I trust this pill for birth control. I switched briefly to Yasmin and that actually made the cramping and breakthrough bleeding worse. My boyfriend and I use withdrawal_ too_ and no worries so far! My health insurance doesn't cover this med_ but I stick with it because it's so effective and I love it! Weary about trying other methods such as NuvaRing and OrthoEvra patch because of side effects (I also read  about women who got pregnant while on NuvaRing). I take this pill at the exact same time every day and do not skip the placebo to start a new pack.,F,20,3  years,1/3/2007,Estrostep 21
79, 3, Regulate period_ birth control,Moodiness_ rages_ mad for no reason. I've never been so mean and cruel in all my life. Slight weight gain_ but I've been on it more than a year_ so it's not an issue now. Maybe bloating near my period. Mostly just get extremely angry for no reason a lot. I'm mad at fiance' right now for no reason.... No acne. I've been on for nearly a year and a half_ not sure I'll stay on due to moodiness/depression_ but I heard that's with all pills? It sucks cause you know you're being irrational_ but there's nothing you can do_ there is guilt from spouting off to those you love. I read how someone just tells themselves to remove themselves from these types of situations or to not even TALK when they are being nuts. But that's hard to do too. I'm trying that now_ no talking unless it's something NICE.Oh yeah cravings are up_ major appetite around the end of the month.,Might try to find a new pill. I can deal with side effects. Sex drive is high near the end_ but lately it's dwindled_ but it might be due to stress at work. Not sure if I'll stay on it_ will ask GYN when I see her in May.,F,29,1.5  years,12/27/2006Email,Estrostep 21

I am suddenly experiencing MANY health issues I have tried to pass off as side effects from having a child at the age of 43. Nothing has helped curb any of my symptoms and I feel so stupid after once again reading the insert with my birth control. All the symptoms I have are listed. I am going off this pill immediately and trying something else.,F,44,1  years,12/26/2006Email,Estrostep 21

The first couple of months my body did not adapt well to it at all- i would experience terrible stomach pain to the point where i could do nothing but lay in one spot. My body was ok after that for a while_ but i then experienced two different episodes of fever and extreme cramping in my side_ followed by spotting almost every month. So then i swithed to ortho tricyclen lo and i love it.,F,19,1  years,11/21/2006,Estrostep 21

My breast did grow_ which is a plus.  When i do have my period it is really light and lasts 2-3 days.  I had NO weight gain! The only problem is the mood swings and feeling anxiety a lot_ its strange.  I read others and they felt anxiety too_ but i didn't related it to Estrostep. Otherwise_ it is a good pill!,F,24,4  years,11/1/2006,Estrostep 21

I wish i decided never to have sex until i was married or Wanted kids. I hate being the girl. This is ridiculous that i have to get all these acne scars n now brown spots on ym face juss to have sex that he prolly enjoys way more then me.

91, 4, BC,breast tenderness/soreness_ mood swings_ increased appetite the week before my period.,I've been on Estrostep for about 8 years and have been fine with it.  Although recently I've been feeling unhappy and very anxious/nervous for reasons I cannot figure out.  Since this is the only medication I take_ I figured I'd read up on it.  I'm still not sure if it's the medication that's making me feel this way_ but I'm going to stop it and see what happens.  Not until I read everyone else's comments did I realize that I have been experiencing side effects all these years and not really knowing it could be related to the Estrostep. Yeast infections_ breast tenderness_ increased hunger the week before my period_ mood swings.  I'm definitely going to try stopping and see if I feel better.  Anyone else on Estrostep for this long and then just have a side effect manifest???  I'm still not sure if after 8 years a side effect can just pop up.  Thought it would have happened a long time ago if anything!,F,28,8  years,10/18/2006,Estrostep 21

Missed days off from work_ couldn't function on a daily basis_ missed time spent with my kids_ etc.  In and out of emergency rooms and no one could figure out what was wrong with me_ numerous tests after tests_ and everything came up negative_ even blood tests.  It was a terrible feeling thinkig that I was allergic to foods I use to eat everyday.  This went on for 2 years_ until finally this past July_ my new OB/GYN took me off just to see what will happen.  Found out that it was the Estrostep that was making me sick.  This is the first month I have been myself and feeling much better.  I feel like a new person.,,F,40,2  years,10/9/2006Email,Estrostep 21

99, 2, Endometreosis,weight gain_ extremely lathargic_ reduced sex drive_ dizziness_ increased appetite with cravings_ constant cramping and bloating/water retention....NO BREAKTHROUGH BLEEDINGS YET!!!!,I take this pill as a continous contraceptive coverage (3 week cycles) forcing my body to bypass its mentral cycle. Although I haven't had much mood swings_ I have had many other symptoms.  The main symptoms were extreme weight gain 8.5 lbs in less then 2 months on this pill_ constant dizziness where my equilibrium is off and I feel like I am going to pass out_ and extremely tired where I have to take naps often_ which is not like me_  Other symptoms that weren't so bad was minimal cramping_ extreme bloating_ strange cravings (spicy foods) and tightness/shortness in my chest.  I am going to give it another month since people say it takes about 3 months to level the symptoms out and with my condition_ low estrogen pills are limited so I don't have many choices.,F,28,2  months,9/11/2006,Estrostep 21

(I was hoping my breasts were growing_ but I don't think they did.),I was worried to start it when I saw the bad reviews many gave it but I have had no troubles.

After the 3rd month I finally noticed my low sex drive. For the last 6 months I have had 4 yeast infections (outbreaks from hell ladies).  The week before my period_ I find myself eating and eating until my period is over.

The worse thing is that within a week I have put on at least 3-5 lbs. and feel like my stomach is swelled all the time (might as well be pregnant- it feels that way). Now I am worrying way more about my wedding dress still fitting in 2 months than getting pregnant. Also I am tired all day and wide awake at night even though I take the pill in A.M. Another bad thing is the rash that I have developed under my arms and on my stomach. Told dr. about it and she said to keep taking until end of cycle unless rash gets worse. Well it may not be worse but it's not better so I am ignoring her suggestion and quiting estrostep now. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL! I wish I would have found this site before I took the first one.

For my condition which was a frequent period every 2-1/2 -3 weeks_ which were extremely painful_ and left me guessing when I would get my period_ estrostep was a welcome medication. I'm on it now and don't feel any cramps. I noticed that I had an increase in appetite and cravings for spicy foods.

I also had noticed a decline in my libido and gained 40+ lbs. My doctor put me on Estrostep_ and I was very anxious to make the switch. I had't had a period in 4 years due to the shot_ so maybe is why my first month on Estrostep has been so bad_ but i wake up EVERY NIGHT with cramps so bad that I can't walk or move. And my breast are so sensitive and tender that taking a shower irritates them. I also went from  low libido to NO libido. I am 24 years old. That's not supposed to happen! I am MISERABLE! I am going to stay on Estrostp for one more month to see if it gets any better_ but if the cramps continue I will have no choice but to stop taking it. I never had cramps even before birth control and they are one of the worst pains I've experienced.

157, 1, Birth Control,Migraine headaches_ Brown spots developed on my face_ and I was noticing extreme mood swings and depression_ plus I was bleeding almost throughout the entire month,I hardly ever get headaches_ and have never had a migraine in my life.  I started getting migraines on my menstral cycle and my general practioner thinks there's a link to this new pill.  I was previously on Ortho-Tri and switched because I was spotting.  But I never had any other problems with Ortho_ and my skin was flawless and glowing as a result of taking it for five years.  After I switched to Estrostep_ I didn't notice any changes right away_ but they have been nonstop for the last two weeks (migraines_ mood swings_ depression).  I also had a fainting spell with a migraine a month ago that I now think might be related.  The mood swings are the worst.  I am not normally a moody person and I find my emotions are completely out of my control_ and it's affecting my relationship with my boyfriend and coworkers.  And I noticed a brown spot on my face_ and have begun to develop acne_ which is highly unusual for me!

I am not myself and have alienated my friends and loved ones by driving them insane.  I tried OTC and it broke out my face.  OTC-lo did as well.  I asked for a BC pill to combat the slight acne and now I am an emotional rollercoaser.  It will probably clear your acne which you can appreciate on your own b/c no one will be around you to care.  My best friend asked me_ ""Do you like being this person?""  My answer?  NO!  And I'm off to find a new BC.",F,28,4  months,3/7/2006,Estrostep 21
160, 1, contraception,Became irritated on day 2!! I was moody_ and hated everything!  The worst part was the 12 pound weight gain in 3 weeks!!!

162, 3, Pregnancy Prevention,In the first month I had horrible breast tenderness and mood swings but they subsided.  I did gain 10 lbs. in 6 months. Whether it be hormonal or due to increased appetite is hard to say. After 6 months my husband and I started to notice changes in my personality.  I re-read the booklet on the drug and realized that I was probably experiencing depression as a side effect.  Accompanying the depression has been extremely low sex drive as well.,The drug did shorten and lighten my period and cramps which is great and it has indeed prevented pregnancy but these perks came at a huge cost.  The mood changes are awful.  Thanks for your posts_ now I know it is my birth control not my mental health!,F,26,8  months,2/17/2006,Estrostep 21

164, 2, ,I was prescribed this drug to help out with breakthrough bleeding I was experiencing. After taking this for 2 months my face has completely broken out and I have gained at least 8 pounds.

I have no desire for sex. I'm changing pills this month.,F,34,4  months,2/1/2006,Estrostep 21

I gained 15 pounds in three weeks with a total weight gain of 26 pounds during the four months I was taking this pill.  I started out at 130 and ended at 156.  (I'm 5'6"")  My boobs were so big I wanted to cut them off and give them to someone else.  I went from a small B to a large C and they were so sore it hurt to even wear a t-shirt.  I was irritable and felt like a cow.  Cravings were out of control.  I never felt satisfied and I was hungry all the time.  I've been off the pill for 11 months now_ and I've lost 10 pounds but I cannot get rid of the rest.  I am miserable.  Just switched doctors because he told me I need to get on Weight Watchers.  I have never ever had a weight problem before taking this medicine.  I am athletic_ I exercise_ and I try to eat right although my appetite has grown tremendously since taking this pill.  I eat way more than I ever have in my life.  Oh_ and libido was out of control.  I was just a raging ball of starving hormones.",F,26,4  months,1/3/2006,Estrostep 21

I have never bled for so long.  I got AF on Dec 2nd and bled/spotted until AF came again today Dec 26.  I have not felt normal at all and in fact my husband asked where his wife had gone.  My poor 11 month old was probably wondering too.  I just need to get my dr to give in and change me to something else.

I have a very full life and a wonderful new relationship and no reason to feel blue_ but I'm not sleeping - I'm moody_ emotional_ irrational_ and feel anxious_ nervous and emotionally raw.

188, 2, low libido,low sex drive_ painful cramps,My libido increased for about 2-3 wks and then was back to normal (very low). The whole reason for switching to this brand from Ortho TriCycline was because it would increase testosterone and ultimate increase my libido. I've been taking BC for almost 5 yrs now and can notice the difference in libido. I might consider going off BC entirely for this reason.,F,25,2  years,11/9/2005,Estrostep 21
189, 1, Birth Control,Disaster! Was on LoOvral and it started having bad side effects (low sex drive_ bad periods and PMS) over time. I thnk maybe as I age my own hormone levels are changing and so my old BC stopped being ok.   Doctor prescribed Estrostep. Well_ Estrostep gave me cystic acne (I never had acne before)_ non existent sex drive_ i gained 12 pounds (from 113 to 125)in 3 weeks while working out 5 times per week (yes I had terrible carb cravings_ but still I was spinning and doing other cardio 5 times per week!)_ and i felt really low and anxious for no reason. I was waking up almost every night between 4-6 a.m. with really bad anxiety. AWFUL. I just started nuva ring and hope it works out.

Anyways_ it has put a lot of stress on my relationship with my boyfriend too...it makes you very moody and has made me lash out at those i really care about.
