2, 4, Prevent pregnancy,So far I've been pleased. Periods have gotten lighter over the years and the cramps are barely noticeable. Only downside is I've gained 15 pounds. I've noticed an increase in appetite since I began taking them.,,F,18,1  years,8/29/2014,Estrostep 21
3, 5, regulation_ acne_ prevent pregnancy,regulated and lightened my periods. didn't really help clear up acne_ but getting older did. I still get more pimples around the time of my period_ bloating_ and breast swelling/tenderness.,I have PMDD and I don't think this really helps it_ but I've been on it 10 years so I don't know how I would be without it. It has worked to prevent pregnancy for 10 years so I'd say that's pretty good! As a side note_ I tried Orthotricyclen before Estrostep (and I actually take Tilia FE_ the generic) and it was bad bad bad for me. Everyone reacts differently to different birth control pills.,F,27,10  years 1X D,6/9/2014,Estrostep 21
4, 4, acne prevent pregnancy,headaches at night_ tiredness and feeling of being weak and low in energy. at first I was very nauseous all the time and had heightened sense of smell and taste (I was a pickier eater than my 3 year old). Acne never completely cleared up. gained 10 lbs.,Over all this is a good birth control_ I was on Mirena IUD before this for a couple of years which gave me severe acne and increased hair growth. The one thing I liked about Mirena was the increased energy level and no mood swings. Estrostep is completely different_ I feel more womenish (if that makes sense) the hair on my head and eyelashes are actually thicker and my body hair has actually decreased and slowed in growth. My skin actually looks and feels more radiant and less greasy (the hormones in Mirena made my skin produce excess oil). The tiredness and weak feeling is still there I have just gotten used to it_ but the heightened senses have went away.  I have been trying everything for the passed month to lose the 10 lbs I gained but have had no luck. I have never had a problem losing weight until now. I was 125 lbs before I started taking this BC and now I am 135 lbs. I am working out for an hour a day 4 days a week and eating clean an have actually gained a pound. My next step is cleansing my liver of excessive hormones hope it works. The described effects are in comparison to Mirena and the side effects were by no means extraordinary.,F,26,1  years 1X D,2/19/2014Email,Estrostep 21
5, 1, Acne,Extreme vaginal dryness_ increased appetite. Breast tenderness. Spotting,,F,31,2.5  weeks 1X D,5/8/2013Email,Estrostep 21
6, 4, Moderate acne,The worst side effect was that I bled for 3 weeks straight during the first month taking it. I was off birth control pills for about 4 years because my acne got better. It wasn't excessive bleeding (good bleeding for about 1 week_ then spotting for 2 weeks). For the second month_ my period returned to normal.,Great with acne_ I don't have breakouts any more.,F,23,2  months 1X D,4/6/2012Email,Estrostep 21
7, 2, Birth Control and help Acne,Spotting_ Unusually emotional_ Breast pain_ Either very hungry or not hungry at all,Mostly I hated this bc because my period became completely unstable. I normally get it like clockwork every 27 days and this threw it off completely_ I wasn't spotting I was getting a period 3 times a month just shorter. It also made my boobs hurt REALLY badly_ sad I was hoping it would work out.,F,21,2.5  months20 1X D,2/1/2012Email,Estrostep 21
8, 5, Prevent pregnancy_ control PMS,Altered period cycle -- almost all of my PMS symptoms (cramps_ zits) occur the week BEFORE my period now. Period length was not shortened as much as other oral contraceptives have shortened it.,This was the ONLY pill that did not make me fat. Yaz and Ortho Tri Cyclen both made me go from 118 lbs to 140 lbs over the course of months. This BC allowed me to shed the weight immediately back down to 121 lbs. Helped control mood swings tremendously. Helped acne (except while on period). Helped cramps. Only downside -- period was not shortened or lightened as much as other BCs have and this pill is expensive (co-pay tends to run high_ $25 for me_ even for generic).,F,18,1  years 1X D,12/12/2011,Estrostep 21
9, 1, Endometriosis,Wanted to put a gun to my head and blow my brians out. Cried over everything and nothing.  Became evil towards family and friends.,My GYN had switched me because I had been on the same pill since my endometriosis surgery two years prior and she wanted to make sure my system was maintaining. I finally realized_ after having such a horrendous argument with my mother that I blacked out I was so angry_ that it had to be this pill.  It was like being possessed! I have never had such erratic mood swings and crying jags.  It was a horrible_ horrible month_ especially the week before my period.  Went directly back on previous pill and have been too frightened to try anything else.,F,43,30  daysFE 1X D,9/25/2011,Estrostep 21
10, 4, Lower estrogen birth control,first week i experienced numbness/tingling in arms and legs but this stopped the second week. start of third week i have been experiencing constant breast tenderness_ very vivid dreams the entire month.,I switched to this bc because i was on ortho-tricyclen for several years and i had a lowered libido and frequently yeast infections. Although i have not had my period yet on this new bc i can say that i am happy with the switch. my breasts are sore and the vivid dreams are a bit annoying but i like some of the other effects. i have improved mood_ less constipation_ slightly higher libido and no yeast infection. it is amazing how switching pills can change problems that you never knew were associated with the pill. i would recommend this pill to women who are curious if higher estrogen might be behind some of their problems. I will update more after my period next week to give a full review of this product. So far though_ i am happy with it.,F,24,3  weeks20_25_30 1X D,2/22/2011Email,Estrostep 21
11, 3, Prevent Pregnancy,Negatives: Weight gain of 5-7 lbs so far. Breast size increase and constant tenderness. Slightly more tired. Major decrease in sex drive. Positives: Wonderful during period: No cramps_ small headaches only 1 or 2 days_ didn't make me nausated like most birth controls. (Was on generic Tilia Fe the first month and I would NOT suggest that to anyone. Constant headaches/migraines the WHOLE month I was on it. And an increase in anxiety; slight depression; more moody.,I was on the Nuvaring for 6 months and it was WONDERFUL! No side effects at all except extra discharge and shorter lighter periods. I had a slight discomfort during intercourse and knew mutliple people who had gotten pregnant while on nuvaring so I switched to Estrostep. I am going to continue it and I think my body will adjust for the most part_ and working out will take care of the weight gain.,F,23,2  months 1X D,2/4/2011,Estrostep 21
12, 1, prevent pregnancy,Crippling anxiety! This BC messed up so much_ and I've tried several brands of hormonal BC. The anxiety and panic attacks stopped me from going about my life and eventually gave me IBS that I still have 5 years later. The month after I stopped taking the pills my anxiety levels went back to normal (but my stomach never did),Wish I had never tried it!!,F,26,3  months 1X D,1/31/2011,Estrostep 21
13, 3, regulate period,im 5ft3 and when i started taking it i weighed 120 and i am now 131..my boobs hurt so very bad to the point im going to call my dr to complain in the morning. im still in my 34d bra but i could probably use the next size up but i refuse to buy a new bra:) its not my entire boob that hurts just the outer part almost like they are growing full speed ahead:)my face is broke out really bad but my chest and back that use to be bad is as clear as a bell now:)go figure. im tired and forgetful all the time now. seem confused alot and my husband says im more moody. a real bitch according to him:)but guess what..it regulated my period_ comes like clockwork now but is it really worth all the other side effects??? I THINK NOT!!!!!,WEIGHT GAIN_ MOODY_ FORGETFUL_ TIRED ALL THE TIME,F,30,2  months 1X D,1/30/2011Email,Estrostep 21
14, 5, Birth Control,Extreme hunger the week before a period.,I have used Estrostep off and on for the last 6.5 years.  I have had nothing but good results with it.  It decreased the severity of my cramps (I use to vomit due to the pain)_ I knew exactly what day I would get my period_ my skin was clear_ and I didn't get pregnant while on it.  I did switch to Mercett for 1 year to see if the B/C pills were causing my migraines (Turns out they weren't). The Mercett didn't even compare to Estrostep.  I will be using it for as long as I can.,F,25,6.5  years 1X D,9/27/2010,Estrostep 21
15, 2, For Pregnancy Prevention,weight gain_ depression_ moodiness_ skipped period (or withdrawal bleeding i guess it's technically called)_ severe headaches_ lethargy_ upset stomach_ stomach pain_ sore breasts_ very very stingy sore nipples (sucked real bad),i was on lutera (generic for allesse) for two years and never had any bad side effects_ until it stopped controlling my bleeding so i switched to the estrostep.  after the first month on estrostep fe's generic (tilia)_ i had bleeding for a day or two_ after the second month_ i had no period at all.  i've taken a dozen preg tests_ all negative.  the headaches occur all through the month but the worst seem to fall in the third week of pills_ they are so bad i can't do anything other than lie down and cry. i've been depressed and lack interest in most things around me.  my sleeping habits have gotten messed up too_ i find it hard to get to sleep but once i do_ i find it even more difficult to get up.  the sore boobs and nippies didnt' start until i began this third month pack of bc_ that was two weeks ago_ the nippie burn has subsided and my breast aren't as sore as they were last week.  i have had some mild cramping sensations as well.  oh_ and a yeast infection that just won't quit.  i really don't like this pill but i'm hoping these side effects will clear up after a while.,F,30,2.5  months 1X D,7/12/2010,Estrostep 21
16, 5, Prevent pregnancy_ acne,Weight gain_ some hair loss,This is by far the best birth control I've been on. I started on Ortho-Evra and HATED it. Went to Estrostep and loved it. Then I got Tilia (Estrostep's generic) to save money and went right back to Estrostep. Tilia made me super depressed and have frequent suicidial thoughts. No thanks! Estrostep keeps my libido good_ my acne under control_ and my periods light and regular. I would recommend Estrostep to anyone.,F,33,3  years 1X D,6/29/2010Email,Estrostep 21
17, 1, Birth control,No sex driveWeight Gain_ 20 lbs in the last 2 years.  I worked my ass off the first 3 years in order to maintain my weight.Cry over anything (I hated moody women and promised I would never be moody).  I am in bad shape today.  I cry_ get angry_ don't want to leave the house_ I do not like the person I have become_ even though I am very successful at my job and my relationship is wonderful_ but I fight with my emotions everyday.,,F,27,5  years,12/30/2009,Estrostep 21
18, 3, birth control,weight gain; missed a period_ spotting and deceased sex drive,I was very worried when i missed my period and 2 weeks later i started spotting.  My doctor said i was getting use to it. I've gained 15lbs in 3 mos but thats a good thing for me.. I like being thicker.,M,24,3  months,12/18/2009,Estrostep 21
19, 4, birth control and acne,much shorter_ lighter periods_ mild cramping,I am very happy with this pill_ I have been on Yasmin and Yaz before switching to this to try and help with my acne. My acne hasn't improved or worsened_ but my periods are super light and short with mild to severe cramps on the first day or two.,F,21,2  years,11/6/2009,Estrostep 21
20, 4, birth control and regulate period,weight gain. i have gained about 15 lbs in the two years i've taken it. also had an increase in facial hair. and moodiness is heightened for me during pms time - which i never had an issue with before.,the upside: it caused my periods to be like clockwork when they were never even close to regular_ before estrostep. also_ have had much less intense cramping (used to be so bad i'd pass out)_ and my periods are much lighter.,F,29,3  years,9/8/2009,Estrostep 21
21, 4," As a ""vaccination"" to ovarian cance",Increased breast size_ 20 lbs weight gain_ decreased sex drive,I was advised by my OBGYN to take E due to family risk of ovarian cancer. She told me that 10 years on E would drastically reduce my cancer risk. I like the drug with the exception of the weight gain.,F,48,9  days,7/21/2009,Estrostep 21
22, 5, Prevent Pregnancy,Zero sex drive,I have been on this birth control for 8 years and overall_ I would recommend it to anyone.  Not going to lie_ the first 4 - 6 months were rough: I was nauseous all the time_ I lost a 10 pounds (went from 120 to 110)_ and had spotting.  Once my body got used to it_ the drug was a miracle - very light periods at the same hour each month.  Major downside - I have absolutely no sex drive and I really believe it is because of the birth control.,F,25,8  years,7/6/2009,Estrostep 21
23, 2, Birth Control,"very slight weight gain_ cramps during period_ extremely low sex drive during the ""white pills"" but felt like i was in heat during ""placebo-pills""-week (i never actually took the placebos though.) Pain during sex (deep pain_ near cervix probably)_ slight bleeding after sex. Need more sleep than usual.",I was on Orthotricyclin Lo before_ but it was getting too expensive for me_ so my doc at school recommended estrostep. I'm hoping that my body will get used to it by the 3rd month. if not_ i'm definitely switchin pills again. i'm getting way too many negative side effects from this pill...orthotricyclin NEVER gave me weird/bad side effects.,F,21,1.5  months,5/16/2009,Estrostep 21
24, 5, Birth control,The first month_ I had horrible diarrhea and stomach cramps when I went on the placebo week_ but I'm now thinking it was unrelated to the pills_ and just a coincidence. I stopped taking the placebo iron pills just in case_ and the problem never returned.,My boobs got huge! Again_ could just be a coincidence_ but I went from a 34B to a 34D in 2 months. Not complaining though! Also_ my sex life is greatly improved - I'm in the mood more often_ and orgasm more easily. Hooray!,F,19,3  months,5/7/2009,Estrostep 21
25, 3, control symptoms of endometriosis,increase in facial hair_ weight gain_ increase in blood pressure_ change in vision_ thinning scalp hair_ lots of yeast infections that were hard to get rid of,I take this BC pill continously for endometriosis. I loved that I did not have extreme mood swings around my period time anymore. I did not have anymore horrible cramps at all. It helped some with my acne_ but I still have quite a bit of acne.,F,34,3.5  years,4/6/2009,Estrostep 21
26, 5, mainly help with severe pms,all positive effects - had the least weight gain. Only one concern - does taking it for a long period of time have negative effects. I am afraid to go off of it because my psychological well being is really important.,I needed a pill to regulate my periods and help ease the severe emotional drama that came 2 weeks before my period. My emotional upheaval would effect my children and my husband. I wound up feeling guilty all of the time. Estrostep took away all of the emotional problems.,F,44,15  years,1/9/2009,Estrostep 21
27, 5, Birth Control,"At first mood-swings_ now increased confidence and high levels of self-assurance_ weight gain (20 lbs in 10 years)_ positive personality changes (I feel very ""motherly"" towards just about anyone)_ emotional at times_ migrane once a month.",Well_ I've been on this for 10 years and it definitely prevents pregnancy.  It also has caused me some positive side-effects (increased confidence and kindness towards others) and negative side-effects (major weight gain and a migrane once a month).,F,29,10  years,12/29/2008,Estrostep 21
28, 4, prevent pregnancy,Increased discharge_ frequent spotting_ a few missed periods.,No change in my moderate acne_ unfortunately. Slight weight gain that could have been many other factors in my life. No real breast increase. I always spot about a week after my period for 2-3 days. Gyno says it's normal and doesn't bother me too much. But lately my periods have been coming later and later during the inactive pill week and sometimes haven't come at all_ which is very worrisome. No mood changes_ very high sex drive_ can't complain too much.,F,22,4  years,12/19/2008,Estrostep 21
29, 2, Birth contol,Nausea_ bladder infections_ mood swings,The pill worked fabulously the first month - I lost about 10 pounds_ had no nausea or headaches.  But after that_ it's gone downhill.  The second month I started getting recurrent bladder infections and the last two months_ once I start the last set of active pills_ I can count on being nausated in the morning_ if not during the whole day.  What started out great kind of backfired...,F,22,4  weeks,11/17/2008,Estrostep 21
30, 4, Birth Control,Major weight gain in the first 3 months_ I went from 120 to 145.  I have since been on this pill for 2 years and 3 months with no problems_ and I've managed to take and keep most of the weight off.  My emotions were crazy for the first 6 months_ but everything regulated itself and I feel more like me again.,I'd reccomend this brand.,F,21,2  years,9/11/2008,Estrostep 21
31, 3, Endometriosis,Moodiness_ cramping in legs while sleeping_ increase in anger/easily upset.,This pill wasn't horrible_ but it did mess with my emotions. I have always been sensitive and can get upset easily_ but I feel like Estrostep made it even worse. I also got angry much easier too. The strangest thing was my legs cramping up at night. It would happen at random times while lying in bed and would really hurt. I noticed it in my upper thighs mostly_ but often the entire leg. I have since switched to LoEstrin24 and am feeling much better. Getting more headaches on this one_ not sure if that is why though.,F,21,1  years,7/29/2008,Estrostep 21
32, 4, Birth Control,mild moodiness_ dry skin/ eyes_ heavy breakthrough bleeding,Estrostep Fe is hands-down the best birth control I've ever been on.  This first time I was on BC_ I tried Ovcon.  Then I switched to Balziva (THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE).  On the advice from a friend_ I tried Estrostep.  I do not have the extream moodiness that I had on the other 2 pills_ or any weight gain.  I weigh the same today as I did when I started taking it. I do have breakthrough bleeding_ but I have experinced this will other pills.  My regular periods are so light_ I feel like I can handle the breakthrough bleeding.  Over all_ its a great pill!,F,25,4  months,7/4/2008,Estrostep 21
33, 3, birth control_ ovarian cyst,depression_ lethargy_ weight gain,This is the only bc pill I've ever taken_ and I've taken it mostly regularly for almost a decade now.  The first 7 years I was on it_ I would have given it a 5.  My periods were lighter_ regular_ hardly any cramping.  However_ in past two years_ went off it for stretches and noticed that I had way more energy_ lost about 5 pounds each time_ etc.  Have finally just asked my doctor about switching to something else_ though am worried that any other pill will be just as bad w/side effects...,F,28, ,7/3/2008,Estrostep 21
34, 5, birth control/endometriosis,Possible weight gain (5 lbs),I've been on Estrostep FE for 8 years.  It's the only BCP that I've ever tried.  I love it!!  I used to have awful cramps and very heavy periods.  My period are practically non-existent and I don't have any cramping at all.  My skin looks great_ too.  The only complaint that I have is a possible 5 lb weight gain_ which is all in my stomach.,F,31,8  years,4/10/2008,Estrostep 21
35, 3, birth control,large appetite all the time,i loved how light my periods were and how i always knew when they were going to be_ HOWEVER_ while on estrostep i've gained around 15 pounds and always have the appetite of a 300 pound man!!! It's really great to know that i'm not the only one who has had this problem with it...,F,21,2.5  years,2/28/2008,Estrostep 21
36, 2, birth control,hair loss_ mood swings,,F,33,8  months,2/28/2008,Estrostep 21
37, 5, pregnancy preventtion_ acne,,I LOVED this pill. I never had any PMS and periods were light and very predictable. Unfortunatly_ it is expensive and w/out insurance anymore Doc suggested I try another one. Tried OrthoTriLo and have a lot of symptoms. Trying Loestrin 24. We'll see how that goes. I may end up switching back to Estrostep.,F,24,8  years,2/27/2008,Estrostep 21
38, 3, I have cyst,I get migranes and the medicine makes it worse.,I don't really get my period when being on the medicine. Barely any pain and any side effedcts. Great pill exceot for the migranes and weight gain!!,F,20,3  years,1/24/2008,Estrostep 21
39, 3, Prevent Pregnancy,I've been on Estrostep for about 2 years and I've gained a ton of weight. I've missed my period a bunch of times - once for 2.5 months when I was sixteen_ that was scary... currently in my second missed month_ already taken 2 tests and both negative but still nervous. Not fun. I'm moody and incredibly lethargic (probably due to my intense weight gain...)I could sleep for days on end without a thought. This is my only b/c I've ever tried but I think I want to switch.,,F,18,2  years,1/22/2008,Estrostep 21
40, 1, birth control,Extreme depression_ moodiness_ crying often_ Very hungry_ anxiety_ tired all the time_ can't sleep_ caused acne (when I didn't have any to begin with)_ have hot flashes where my skin gets red then goes away.,I have never had such bad side effects.  Since this is the completion of my first month_ I will try a second month to see if there are any changes_ but will be seriously changing to a different medicine if things don't improve.,F,30,28  days,1/8/2008,Estrostep 21
41, 5, acne,I was taking these pills last year and they were working well for me. I had mild acne as soon as I turned 21 so I decided to take the Estrostep. My acne started clearing up for me and I was also gaining weight. Yeah_ I know most people won't think that's an advantage_ but for me it was. I was 5'3'' and weighted about 115. As soon as I started taking these pills I went up to 135 and looked great with a clean and clear face.,I have one problem. I'm pretty possitive these are the pills I was taking last year_ but I want to make sure. For those of you who took these pills last year_ did they come in a pink/purple box and said With Acne Contraceptive on the top of the box? I stopped taking these pills about the beginning of this year and can't seem to find them_ of course til now on the internet.Thanks,F,22,6  months,12/23/2007,Estrostep 21
42, 5, birthcontrol/ lessen period length,i have never had any bad side effects.,Wonderful_ a little expensive compared to other birth control pills_ however it is well worth the money for me.  I have been on estrostep for 3 years and love it!  Never would change... before this i was on ovcon 35 and i was getting extremely sick.  Estrostep is the way to go,F,19,3  years,12/14/2007,Estrostep 21
43, 5, acne_eliminate cramps_birthcontrol,It was wonderful_ I have tried the depo_ estrostep_ and also ortho.This birth control made my periods seem obsolete_ i only bled for one or two days_ no cramps_ no acne (which i battle)_ and NO MOOD SWINGS!! I even lost about 15lbs while on this birth control. The only reason why i switched was due to a loss in insurance_ so the health department gave me ortho and depo.my hair fell out with the ortho pills_ and i gained about 5 lbs.NEVER get the depo.its poisen. I have gained 2olbs. which is alot for my small frame.estrostep is heaven compared to that shot..id rather bleed for two days out of the month than turn into a fat and manly woman (hair growth increased w/ depo too!) Oh and imagine how that affects the sex drive! (blah)I cannot wait to get back on estrostep birth control!!!!!!,i took this BC when i was 16 until i was 18..ortho for about two moths...depo for about 4 months now.,F,20,2  years,12/13/2007,Estrostep 21
44, 4, Birth Control/Heavy Flow,Minimal side effects,I have been really happy with Estrostep_ however I have never been on any other form of birth control_ so I have nothing to compare it to.  Before I was on it_ I had really heavy flow_ after the first month of taking it_ my monthly flow has been really light.  I never experienced any of the weight gain or massive breakouts that others have experience_ in fact I experience the opposite.  I've always had a problem with acne_ and this pill have completely cleared my face_ with an exception to one or two pimples during the week i'm on my period.,F,28,1.5  years,10/26/2007,Estrostep 21
45, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,Extreme moodiness_ highly emotional_ inability to cope with stressful situations_ cramping_ low sex drive,This was the first birth control I tried.  It was prescribed by my GYN and I didn't question the prescription.  The extreme moodiness has caused problems at work and at home.  Before starting on the pill_ I never had PMS type symptoms and now it is like clockwork.  The one advantage has been timing as my periods were never regular before.  I would very cautious if I were prescribed this pill.,F,24,3  years,10/21/2007,Estrostep 21
46, 4, Birth Control,The only complaint was longer periods (five days instead of four) but for the most part_ it was fine. I lost weight easier and had little to no cramps. Migraines were slightly harder to kill but it was mad accurate as to when my period was about to start.,,F,21,2  years,9/25/2007,Estrostep 21
47, 5, To prevent pregnancy,sore breast about (3 days),Estrostep is great i've been taking it now for 8yrs. I've tried lots of birth control over the years that have made me sick to my stomach but this is great. I take it every night about 10pm. The only side affect i've experienced is sore breast for a couple of days. I would rather have sore breast for 2-3 days than feeling nausea. My period is more comfortable and my skin is great. It actually has also made me want to have sex more. So overall its a great pill.,F,25,8  years,9/24/2007,Estrostep 21
48, 1, Regulate perioods,Horrible side effects! Bled for a whole month_ didn't get my period for 7 months after that_ gained 15 lbs_ vomiting_ horrible depression/mood swings_ NO sex drive whatsoever. Bad acne flair ups. It's been 6 years and I'm horrified to try another pill because my 1st experience was so bad.,,M,20,8  months,9/17/2007,Estrostep 21
49, 3, Regulate mood swings and cycle,Very effective for mood swings and cycle regulation_ but have noticed increased migraines_ vaginal dryness and extremely low sex drive.,,F,45,5  years,9/11/2007,Estrostep 21
50, 5, birth control,None,I have tried two different 'traditional' estrogen focused BCP and they gave me horrible side effects.  I was severely depressed_ irrational_ lost my entire sex drive_ and gained a bit of weight on the other pills.  My doctor suggested Estrostep as an alternative_ since it does focus more on progesterin more than estrogen.  I've been on it for going on three years now_ and it's amazing.  My periods are to the minute_ almost_ and my PMS symptoms are almost gone.  My libido is back up to a normal level and I don't *feel* as if I am taking a medication_ which should be the goal of any medication/treatment. I know a lot of you are bashing this pill_ but all of our bodies are different.  What works for most women (Ortho Tri) was the absolute pits for me.  Remember to each their own!,F,22,3  years,9/2/2007,Estrostep 21
51, 3, control cramps and bleeding,break-through bleeding (for almost 2 weeks each month)_ very low sex-drive the week or so before my period_ and mood swings.,I have experienced very bad break-through bleeding since the first month on this pill; sometimes it is even heavier than my period.  Also_ I never used to PMS that badly when I wasn't on the pill_ and now my mood swings the week or so before my period are horrible.  I actually threw out my Estrostep tonight because I couldn't deal with how it was making me feel.  My doctor just prescribed Femcon FE to me to fix these problems and I can't wait to start it.  However_ the Estrostep did make my period a lot more managable...2 days instead of 5_ and much better cramps.,M,19,7  months,6/21/2007,Estrostep 21

53, 3, birth control,Anxiety_ depression_ mood swings_ migraines and breast tenderness,I have been taking Estrostep for about 5 months now. At first I felt great and didn't really feel many symptoms except for my boobs being really sore. But about up till a month ago I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety. I'm not sure if it's directly related to this pill but I don't know what else it could be. After reading other women's comments about anxiety related to this pill it makes me feel so much better that I'm not alone.,F,26,5  months,6/17/2007,Estrostep 21
54, 4, As a birth control method,The only side effects I may have experienced was mild weight gain_ if any_ maybe a couple pounds. Some irritability_ depression.,Estrostep has been pretty good for me. I used to have horrible long_ painful menstrual cycles. When I began the pill after a few months my periods have shortened to about 4 days. They are light and almost cramp free. I am also on a schedule. I know the exact day my period is coming. Most of the time it has done a great job in managing my acne except in times that I am under a great deal of stress. I could have possibly gained a few pounds but it could have also been from my diet. I do notice irritability at times and also times of depression that could be an effect of the pill. I would still recomend estrostep it has been reliable and very helpful.,F,18,2  years,6/11/2007Email,Estrostep 21
55, 5, birth control,I really have not had any side effects.,I have been on it for 2 1/2 years now and I have had absolutely no problems. I have had very minimal cramps_ 3-4 day light periods which are very regular_ no spotting_ slight breast enlargement and weight gain which may or may not be connected. I love it. All of the horrible stories I had heard from friends on the pill never happened. It's great.,F,23,2.5  years,6/9/2007,Estrostep 21
56, 4, birth control_ to regulate periods,Small amount of weight gain_ occasional bleeding between periods,It really helped regulate my periods. Before I started on it I never knew when my period was going to come. And my periods were also really heavy and really long with awful cramping_ also I had problems with throwing up right around the time my period would start. Now that I am on Estrostep I still get some cramping but it is very manageable with a few Tylenol. No more puking either. I have gained about 5 pounds but I don't know if this is a result of the pill itself or the fact that I'm no longer throwing up 3 days out of every month. Occasionally I'll have spotting between periods but it's only about twice a year and doesn't last long so it's not too annoying. My doctor said Estrostep would help to clear up acne that I had on my back and shoulders but it really didn't. But overall Estrostep has been good for me at least and my periods are a lot more manageable now_ and I'm also not pregnant!,F,22,3  years,5/22/2007,Estrostep 21
57, 2, prevent ovarian cysts,I have had the same horrible weight gain as many other people! I've never had a problem with my weight and now after being on this pill for a little over a month - I have gained 8 pounds. I don't even eat that much and I can never lose any weight! In addition_ I feel tired all of the time and very moody. I am going off of this pill at the end of this cycle. ,,F,46,2  months,5/14/2007,Estrostep 21
58, 4, regulate_ birth control,Cleared up stress acne_ some breast enlargement (didn't give me back what I had before nursing 2 children)_ cry easier_ shortened period from 7-14 days to 3-5 days & regulated to every 28 days.,,F,30,2  years,4/20/2007,Estrostep 21
59, 5, birth control.,*** (meant to put years for the last one) I used to have terrible acne_ and I'm allergic to the benzoclyn found in many acne products_ so creams were almost out of the question.  I was also pretty irregular.  I'd go almost 5 months without a period.  But within 3 months of taking Estrostep_ my acne had been greatly healed and my periods were starting to regulate.  My cramps also became lighter and much easier to handle.  I did_ however_ get nauseus on a daily basis_ so I had to switch to taking the pill at night.  Other than that_ I haven't had any problems.,,F,16,1  years,4/18/2007,Estrostep 21
