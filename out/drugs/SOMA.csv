0, 4, Back Spasams,Sleepy_ shakiness_ forgetful_ withdrawals_ blurred vision_ not a care in the world,If been taking somas for 10 years after a car accident. Started out fine taking 1 to 2 pills as needed then it became recreational and I built up a tolerance then I loved the feeling made me feel drunk then I started to drink alchohol with them when I couldn't feel the feeling. Ended up in the hospital numerous times got in trouble with the law. I got 2 DUIs. Needless to say I'm addicted to them. Lost jobs lost friends. I would not recommend them if you have a addicted perssonality. Best sleep I've ever had. P,M,40,10  years350 MG,7/28/2016Email,Soma

3, 5, Severe neck back spasms,Fatigue_ definitely wouldn't drive anywhere after having taken one. It basically helped if I put some mineral ice on laid on the heating pad and then took one.,This is one of the best working relaxers that I have taken_ and taking numerous ones that have not helped at all. I've had two fingers that were numb on my left hand for 2 months I took this muscle relaxer for 3 Days made me and my feeling came back and my two fingers. It really works. Another time I had a spasm in my shoulder blade at 3 a.m. _ I was crying and in excruciating pain_ I took one put some mineral ice on_ and laid on a heating pad and after two cycles of that it was completely gone and I felt better.,F,45,1  years350 mg 2X D,4/21/2016,Soma

7, 4, Herniated Discs and spasms,Blurred vision_ Drunk feeling_ sleepy,I've taken Soma 350 for almost 3 Yeats now for my back pain_ I take 4 only at bedtime as I have 5 young children and I obviously don't wanna be in a stuper while taking care if them. So I only take then when I crawl into bed. I fall asleep in about 45 minutes and get a great nights sleep. I wake up feeling great and take my tramadol in the morning to help with my pain. I don't see how anyone could operate on this medication. Best used at bedtime. Also I stopped this for 9 months why I was pregnant_ no withdraw.... Really Helps Me!!!,F,32,3  years350,12/20/2015Email,Soma
8, 1, Herniated discs_ spondylolesthesis,Absolutely the worst effects trying to get off gradually. My back and legs are cramping and my mind is mush_ can't remember anything.  My doctor says they are hugely addictive. I always took as prescribed and felt fine_ but has been hell coming off,Soma should only be given to to three weeks for treatment. The longer you have taken_ the harder to get off. Wish someone had waned me. My doc thank Doc is tapering me off gradually_ but I still feel wretched. Get off slowly as soon as you can. My nerves are on edge and I'm useless at home_ walking dogs and keeping up house is impossible. So glad I'm retired and don't have children to care for. Please take heed from me_ it is no party feeling like this. Stay away from Soma. You all are feeling so good because narcotics along with soma turn into meprobamates in your brain (similar to heroin). That is why you feel so great on them. My doc believes the FDA is cracking down on prescribing the drug and they can shut down soma manufacturing and none of you will have it to take. Again_ get off ASAP_ sooner the better_ do it very slowly!!!!,F,63,15  years350 4X D,11/8/2015,Soma
9, 5, Leg Cramps/Pain,Sleepiness,I began taking Zanaflex_ but had to switch to Soma due to the headaches they caused. These are my miracle drug and help my morning leg stiffness as well as my cramping at night. They make me sleepy if I take them on an empty stomach.

11, 5, fractured T-7_T-8_ T-9. Musclespasm,drowsiness_ weight gain. tiredness during the day. some headache.,"I'm in med school right now and have taken pharmacology one and two. I know what the potential of this drug is along with many other drugs. All drugs have side effects. Does the benefits outweigh the side effects is the ultimate question you have to ask yourself. It's a individual thing.  Yes_ this drug will make you feel dizzy_ Yes_ it will make you sleepy. Yes_ you can overdose on it_ just like every other drug made. But it is up to YOU to put the drugs into your mouth and swallow them. Yes_ if you take a handful at a time you probably will be sedated for a long period of time. It does not ""relax"" the muscles required for breath. Those are not the muscles it targets. Many that do ""OD"" on this drug_ actually are taking other meds with them like pain meds_ or other CNS depressants. The fastest way to put your life in danger is taking a bunch of pills that should not be taken together or abusing the ones that you are prescribed. I had a hard time sleeping (falling asleep_ staying asleep) Instead of taking addictive sleep meds_ I asked my doc for soma. I take 3_ sometimes 4 at bedtime_ and have been doing so for around 2 years. I sleep. I don't always take that many. sometimes I take 1 or even half. Sorry for the people that lost loved ones to this drug. You can kill yourself with asprin_ tylenol. and alot of other OTC drugs. This drug is not for everyone. Your body chemistry is not all alike. Just take it as needed and prescribed.",M,46,2  years350x3-4 1X D,7/4/2015Email,Soma

20, 1, pain/muscle relaxation,Ever heard of Soma Coma? That's what it does. I used to have an Indian Dr (most don't like opiates) who prescribed me 2 350mg tablets 4 times a day! In the 1950's and 60's this drug was used as a Tranquilizer! Soma has NO muscle relaxing properties. ***USE WITH CAUTION*** especially when combined with CNS depressants.* Subject to abuse_ dependence_ withdrawal and misuse. There is a risk of overdose which may lead to death_  hypotension_ seizures and other health issues. withdrawal symptoms included insomnia_ vomiting_ abdominal cramps_ headache_ tremors_ muscle twitching_ ataxia_ hallucinations_ and psychosis. One of Soma's metabolites_ meprobamate_ (a controlled substance)_ may also cause dependence. *http://www.drugs.com/pro/carisoprodol.html#S2Feel free to contact me with Pain related questions or other issues.Mr. Robert N.

21, 5, muscle spasms_ pain,Occasionally Soma will make me loopy but not every time. If I take it after I've eaten it won't do that to me at all. Very rarely I have had a loss of balance_ maybe 3 times since I started taking it.,I take Soma in addition to Oxycodone and they work WONDERFULLY together for my pain that is caused by arthritis in my spine. This combination actually enables me to function and carry on my responsibilities as a mother of 3 young children_ instead of lying in bed with a heating pad all day and crying from the pain I'm in.

23, 2, SpasmsContractions-NervePain-Damage,Vertigo_ not for hypotension patience_ vomiting_ nausea_ stoned_ drunken spins_ severe constipation_ Fainting_ tachycardia_ no nerve pain_ no severe spasms_ my completely unmanageable pain is gone. I halved my pills same side effects- symptoms. I am trying a fourth now and will see if that works. It's been 30 minutes feel high and it also give anxiety. Hopefully I can adjust as my options for meds are so limited. DO not suggest anyone with low blood pressure take this. I had to puke and put on compression stockings as well as take other BP meds to raise my BP and stop the spins then passed out for 12 hours. At a full dose I worry that I could be in a coma. Couldn't imagine anyone wanting to abuse this as the side effects are awful enough. Dehydration and headaches also occur.,I am hoping this is an adjustment period but will be calling my doctor asap as he suggested. I do not suggest taking with any other sedative/ pain medicine/ almost went to the ER... I do feel out breath a little at a fourth dose.  (this is jst 1/4th of a 350mg pill) Please be careful with this drug. I love reality too so only hope to take this as a last resort if I don't stop all together because I feel completely like I smoked pot in space and not connected with the world around me and not in a good way. I ate with this dose and have been drinking glasses of water. Taking midodrine to raise BP.,F,26,7  days350 2X D,3/24/2014Email,Soma
24, 5, Motorcycle Accident 24 fractures,Tired in the morning,I have posted before about my motorcycle accident. Had 24 fractures and head injury. A year or so later the doc gave me Soma. That was the first good nights sleep I had since my accident. If only people wouldn't take it like skittles__ makes it hard on people that need it for real pain. Keep it down_ it will still work_ you just don't get that nice Soma hug. I was Rx'd 4 a day_ never took more than 3. Over the last 6 months I have cut back to 350 an hour before dinner. Then I take a one at night. It still works after all these years. I bump it with melatonin supplement sometimes. I try not to a lot. It greatly enhances a night with less pain___ gets you through the night. I only take Lortab (2) during the day. It seems like I wake up in a few hours if I take Lortab at night. Don't give in to that 3 or 4 or 40 at a time. Is that a road you want to go down? It's a Barbituate and very addicting_ I know..You will have to pay the piper if you get cut off. So would I at 2 a day. Do yourself a favor and take it only when you need it because your hurting so bad. It will ease your suffering.Funny thing about Soma is that it's a nerve blocker. It blocks the pain signal from getting to your brain. It still hurts but you don't know it. I have had a toothache. Been to the dentist twice. I notice when I take a Soma the toothache goes away. It comes back in a few hours but not as bad. It's a good drug.,M,60,12  years350 2X D,12/6/2013Email,Soma

32, 5, Pain and Help Sleep,I think it has taken my desire to do things away.,Broke 24 bones in motorcycle accident_ collapsed lung_ closed head injury_ fractured pelvis and scapula. I had never heard of Soma. My GP thought Flexeril was making me depressed and wanted me to try Soma. He was writing 4x a day with 11 refills for years. I never took 4 a day_ at one point I was taking 3 a day. Have cut back to 1/2 of a pill early evening and one around 10-11 pm with no problem. This last 1-1/2 is going to be rough to get off. My back was broken and neck injuries make it so I have to sleep on my stomach. Soma takes pain away like nothing else I have tried. I take 2 Lortab during the day but it hardly touches the pain. I don't drive on Soma_ don't feel it is safe because it does make you loopy on one pill. Now after 11 years I feel like I need to stop taking it. I didn't know that a good portion of it metabolizes into metrobromate_ a barbituate that makes it hard to stop.I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard spot. I want to get off it but I keep taking it due to my dislike for pain and enjoying 8-9 hours of sleep. After I take the night one I stay up for hours because it is the first time of the day I am pain free. It is definitely a double edged sword. I don't know if it makes you sick to stop completely_ I have never tried. The pain keeps me coming back every night_ even though I am completely unmotivated. I feel like Soma is robbing me of a life. I am content to watch tv all day_ every day. Maybe from the wreck_ or my age but in my heart I know it',M,60,11  years350 2X D,3/17/2013,Soma
33, 4, Knee muscle spasms,Sleepiness_ loopiness_ nauseau,It helped the muscle spasms stop. and i don't feel like i will develop an addiction_ i'm also on pain meds_ a really low dose for my knee(i've had 3 knee surgeries) and it really is helping me. i would not recommend taking this drug for a long time because it is meant for a 3 week period at most. i would recommend only to those who honestly need some pain relief from an injury. Not for 'recreational use',F,23, 350 mg 4X D,2/22/2013Email,Soma
34, 5, arthritis stiffness and pain,a little constipated and sleepy if I wasn't doing something.,Worked very well.

This is the only medication that actually REACHED my pain and dealt with it well.   I have no side effects_ and have been taking Soma for 7 YEARS....AND THE SOMA STILL WORKS WELL.  I'VE BEEN ON THE SAME DOSAGE for 7 years!!   Still works well. Have not changed the dosage or frequency.   I Pray someone out there will support NOT TAKING SOMA OFF THE MARKET IN THE U.S.  It certainly does much more good than not.

40, 5, Fibromyalgia,I have no side affects from this drug.,I have had fibromyalgia for over 16 years. It is a miserable disease and the only thing that has even eased my pain is SOMA. I had no adverse reactions from it and was actually able to sleep. If this med is taken as prescribed and for what it is needed_ then there should be no problem in taking this drug. As far as addiction_ I don't believe it and I will tell you why. I was on this drug for about five years and I then moved. Once I had new doctors_ they refused to perscribe it to me and I was shut off cold turkey and has no reaction. They have no chosen that I see a pain specialist for my pain and they all have no problem prescribing me narcotics and opioids which are so addicting that I can't understand what is happening here. I hate them_ I feel like crap taking most of them and they just don't work after a while. I have to take doses that are strong enough to knock a horse over to get any relief because my body has gotten use to them. I wish people would fight more for SOMA as it is one of the BEST meds out there. I am sorry for the few that I have read that lost someone to soma but it makes me wonder if they were taking way more than they were prescribed? These people that have a hell of a lot of nerve to come on here and think it is funny to write about you high experiences should be shot! This isn't the purpose for this medical rating.

45, 4, fibro,Some sleepiness_ nothing a cup of coffe couldn't cure for a bit. I can take with or without food. I do not drive however within 30 minutes of taking any dose_ after 30 minutes any lightheadedness subsides and I'm good,In conjunction with my Lyrica_ it has helped me function with only dull pain (most of the time)_ by keeping me loose and directly addressing my pain. I have been hurting excessively and these two drugs have helped me make a huge turnaround. I don't always take all 3 and sometimes I split the first one in half and take those halves as dose 1 and 2...but sometimes the breakthrough pain is simply unbearable. also helps me sleep at night because I can relax_ which can be hard to do when you hurt! I am so sorry to the people who have lost loved ones because of this med_ but I have also lost people to substances which were addictive_ and abused_ because they were adicts. choose to treat the addiction and the pain and try to always choose moderation. this med has saved me and I would fight the *&%#! who would have me suffer like I was before! I have kids and an elderly parent to look after. I have a job_ bills to pay_ and serious obligations to fulfil.I would lose all that_ which is literally my life. depriving me of that is very similar to actually killing me_ except that would be better_ because me family would get my life insurance pay-out; otherwise I am a drain on everyone_ even society.,F,36,30  days250mg 3X D,12/28/2011,Soma
46, 5, Right Lateral Thoracotomy w/ T6 Fus,Metallic taste in my mouth after 20-30min. NO BUZZING,What people rarely know about this medication is that a schedule II anxiety medication is a metabolite of Soma.  If you were to have a blood pharmacology done_ you would find that Meprabomate reveals itself at as much as 7 times the amount of the actual Soma. Also_ if you have been taking it as long as I have_ you may also find that your body isn't metabolizing it as it used to. I take this as prescribed and do not have a problem with it. But in researching it I find that many people abuse it. I guess you might say it's like what you hear about those who do hardcore drugs and get that overwhelming euphoria the first time. Then they continue looking for that same result but cannot find it again. So they do more and more and more. Eventually they wind up either jailed_ or it's always their first priority to obtain and take. If you are prescribed this medication (and it better be for a darn good reason [pain_ spasm] do exactly what the doctor says.

Drowsiness_ and a slight buzz when taken on an empty stomach.,I like this medication because it does not make me feel dependent_ and having a condition that is usually treated with highly addictive pain medications I try to avoid those at all costs. Unfortunately_ since I have been taking this medication I have been having very intense nightmares. That is my biggest complaint and it makes it hard for me because I have to decide what is more important_ to get to sleep and have nightmares_ or stay awake in pain.

51, 4, Herniated Disc in Neck,Tiredness_ Dizziness,Soma worked very well for the first few months_ then I built up a tolerance.  My muscle spasms would be so bad it would cause my neck to flare up causing severe nerve pain.  Soma would help the muscles relax so the neck pain would not flare up.  I stopped taking this right before my surgery_ and after my surgery my surgeon put me on a different medication.  It wasn't working as well by that time anyway.

If I take one pill before bed I sleep well and wake up with very little pain. However_ during a fibro flare the pain will come back after I'm awake for a couple hours. I don't get any of the ""high"" feeling others describe because it just puts me to sleep. I notice that I can't fall asleep without it anymore_ so I don't know if I'm becoming dependant on it or not_ but I have no desire to take it during the day.",F,37,6  months350MG 1X D,9/12/2011Email,Soma

I was taking Flexeril 3X daily to keep me loose during the day.  It was a little hard to function doing that_ but a lot better than debilitating headaches!  I did not find the Soma to cause any ""euphoria"" or ""giddiness"" for me.

57, 5, back surgery,Fell asleep quickly and become light headed if I don't fall asleep,Took after my back surgery and really helped with the combination of perks that I got from the hospital after surgery. For the people with all the negative effects from it make sure you read ALL the side effects so you know what you might be in store for and if you have any call your doctor ASAP. This is a VERY powerful drug with MAJOR side effects and yes it is possible you can die but that is very rare but can happen and it can be VERY addictive so take with caution...this information is not from some normal person I am a RN that works at a hospital. Please don't abuse this drug which most deaths from this drug is because of the toxicity of this drug and mixing it with alcohol which is the worse thing you could do so DON'T DO IT!!! Again it's a good drug to relieve some things but can be very dangerous so take with caution and make sure you know all the possible side effects before taking. Hope this helps.,M,21,2  months350 MG 3X D,5/11/2011,Soma

I also had60 visits with a PT wheree-stim _ ultrasound _ contrast baths and 830 coldlaser therapy was of some help but disregaurding anypain meds the SOMA seemsto help relax the nerve impulses _ which cause pain_ numbness _ tinglingand lack of focus due to these stimuli .  SOMA seems to block the nerve pain _ atleast after these other treatment modalities have maxed out their progression anyway .  I may possibly have perephial neuritis / neuropathy or compressednerves . At this point in myfollow-up therapy it takesmy mind off my feet and gives me more focus andallows me to be in the gameagain . I can actually hold aconversation without thedistraction of pain _ whichoccured sitting _ standing_walking _ or even sleeping _and my wife doesn't haveto watch me move my feetconstantly while we are justwatching TV and I am onceagain able to feel like more of an asset around the house and more capable atwork . luckily I am a lab technician at a major factoryor I might not have the 33years seniority I have at mystill young age _ and wouldmaybe have to retire !!

60, 5, Lower Back Pain. S1/L5 Removed.,High. Happy. Light Headed. Drunken Feeling. But all these feelings go away once you build a tolerance. Weed in a pill form.,Warning! Dont not take with any depression medication or aniexty medication will make soma a gateway drug to dangerous narcotics and overdosing. Also may lead to self inflicting pain_ such as cuts and burns since you it blocks pain receptors and maybe depress you. Best taken on an empty stomach for the first 20mins to get you relaxed. Then eat a very small meal or snack to avoid from having stomach cramps and heart burn because there is so much sodium in the drug. May want tums or antacid on hand to avoid heart burn. Stop use if you experience increase heart rate or shortness of breath and contact your doctor. If after 1-2 weeks the pill doesnt seem to be effective stop taking for 1-2 weeks then start again while using advil or such in the meantime. Enjoy. I know I do_ its hard enough being a 21 year old with a disabled back from a bad car crash from a person t-boning my show car...but things like soma help me do things i enjoy and be happy. :),M,21,6  months350 3X D,10/18/2010Email,Soma

I am getting off of Soma now and luckily I have a VERY supportive husband who is helping me taper off and then takes the bottle to work as I cannot ""police"" myself.  DON'T take this medication if it is not Rxd for you and be cautious with taking too much if your doctor does give it to you.

84, 4, horrid back pain,occasional drowsiness,I really hate hearing all this BS about how bad of a drug this is.  I was in a car wreck where my lower back got messed up.  The ONLY side effect from this drug is occasional drowsiness.  But ONLY when I take it on an empty stomach.  My muscles would always twitch_ I had stinging pain and my back always hurt and felt really really warm.  The first time I took it I felt relief.  I don't understand how you could abuse this drug.. .the only effect is you get tired_ who would want that?  People who abuse are weak and it is their fault_ not the drug(s).  Soma gave me my life back.  Now if we were talking about oxycodone_ that would be a different story. For anyone out there who is addicted to soma or any other drug_ just remember to be strong MIND OVER BODY.  Do not be weak_ yes you may feel like total crap for a few days but that is much better than being a slave to a little blue_ white or yellow pill.  Be responsable and practice self control!!!

If you're an addict_ well you risk being addicted to really anything_ not judging but just saying. Also_ like with anything_ don't mix it with alcohol - you really should know better.

The problem is sometimes she will take some_ and get into that ""soma coma"" phase_ and i think she takes more due to memory loss.

I have been to Houghston Clinic_ Mayo and many doctors in my area. I have tried many medications_ physical therapy_ with some minor results.  My doctors agree that if this medication works for me_ it should be continued.,"Use it as directed and there will be no problems.  Those who misuse the drug are responsible.  The drug is not the problem_ the user is.  Suicide can be carried out in many ways. If someone wants to leave this world_ Soma should not be blamed.  The tables must be placed in the mouth and swallowed.  That choice is not made by the tablet.  It is made by the individual who chooses to misuse the drug.  Feeling ""high"" is NOT my objective.

92, 4, low back spasms/pain,I also take celebrex and acetaminophen daily_ along with Soma. Not sure if side effects are caused by combination of drugs. I have a lot of bowel issues and other health problems that may be [are] worsened by these drugs. Obviously_ Soma does cause drowsiness_ but that wears off pretty quickly. It does act as a sleep aid.,I abhor those who abuse prescription drugs_ especially the pain meds that so many need to survive. Many drugs cause physical dependence_ which is different from addiction_ but can have the same net effect. I'm probably physically dependent on the 3 drugs I take. Before a minor accident_ I took only Soma during severe back spasm_ which typically took 2 weeks of recovery. This went on for 20 years. After my ankle break_ I worried about having an episode_ living alone & being on the mend. (My episodes were so bad that I'd be unable crawl to the toilet with a broken ankle.) That was 6 1/2 years ago & I've been taking Soma_ Celebrex (for arthritis)_ & acetaminophen daily. This is dangerous. I'm going to find someone to help me get off all of them. We should avoid all drugs/meds as much as possible. Pharmaceuticals kill thousands of people annually in the US. More deaths than from illegal substances! Of the 3 meds I take_ Soma is probably the least risky physically. My doctor has refused to write any more Soma scripts_ however. I take 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 (of 350 mg dosage) each day. I've tried other relaxers with horrible side effects and a natural anti-inflammatory_ with little relief.  At 70_ I'm not about to abuse Soma! But apparently Celebrex (possibly as dubious as Vioxx!) and acetaminophen are just fine and the careful use of Soma isn't.

100, 1, Back pain,My daughter....hard time waking her up.  Slurred speach_ not being able to walk a straight line...overused.,Doctors who prescribe this drug over and over again should be shot.  So sick of dealing with a daughter who is addicted to it.,M,30,6  years,8/3/2009,Soma
101, 5, Migranes,This is a miracle in a bottle_ it is one of only 4 pain killers that do anything for my migraines or any pain for that matter_ I would rather take this than Demerol because I can still function. If it is a Really debilitating migraine then I need more than one and I get loopy and sometimes have a memory lapse_ but when I'm having a Migraine that isn't out of the ordinary and I prefer that to laying on the floor writhing in pain in my room that has all the windows painted black with black-out curtains and regular brown curtains wearing earplugs and noise reducing headphones wishing I could just die. Before this I missed at least 2 days a week from school because I couldn't leave my cave of solitude.,I do not have an addictive personality so I can't really judge others but those who just abuse it for the high ruin it for the ones who need it.  When I started taking them for migraines my insurance covered the name brand (which was far more effective) but now a script for name brand is $150.  I'm very sorry if you have an addiction but it is so frustrating to find a doctor when you move that will continue to prescribe it and not think you are a druggie_ after all these years 50 in a month is often more than enough.,F,21,5  years,7/30/2009Email,Soma
102, 5, Migraines/ Back pain and tightness,Tired_ lightheaded_ Euphoric relaxed feeling. Only drug to actually work. Tried Maxalt_ Flexeril_ Imitrex_ Relpax_ etc..,I have had killer migraines for years_ and recently was in a car accident that may have caused permanent damage to my back. This in turn made my migraines turn into intense tension headaches from the tightness in my upper back. My doctors had tried many many drugs and I had seen many specialists. This was the only drug I have taken so far that seems to help. I was told by my doctor to take it with 2 Advil_ this seems to help even more. I went from needing relief and having headaches all the time to maybe needing to take 1 pill every other day with the Advil. I can see how this can become addicting. Please use as directed by your doctor.,F,24,6  months,7/30/2009,Soma

When first taking it_ do take it bedtime.,This is the best muscle relaxer I have ever taken and has the least side effects. I cannot believe the morons on this site who give it a negative rating because they have abused it & gotten ill. DON'T ABUSE IT AND GIVE IT A POOR RATING YOU JERKS. You are the kind of people who cause drugs to be taken off the market because you use them for fun and ruin it for the people who really need them for pain relief.,F,56,15  years,7/18/2009,Soma
104, 5, back and neck pain,I was taking soma's for a few years and found them to be highly addicting_ well in 2004_ my boyfriend of 2 years was taking them like candy a long with lortabs_ and oxycontin 80mg's.  Well I lost him early to the mixture of these drugs_ the early age of 44!!  It was awful and I took myself off all my pain meds and Somas due to his death and the dangers.  I had no idea he was in that BAD of a condition to where he was an addict.  He worked all day long so we never were around each other too awfully much_ I went to wake him up on Memorial Day of 2004 and unfortunatley he was deceased and the Coroners said he had been like that for over 4 hours atleast by the color of his skin and the temperature.  That was the hardest thing I have been through in life so far and never want to experience anything like that_ I was alone at the time_ I had no family where we were living and I wouldn't say the people we associated with at this time were even friends!!  So needless to say it was a wake up cal,"Please do not abuse your medications_ there are a lot of us out here that really need to be taking medications for muscle pain_ and Pain in general_ and it's the ones who do not need the meds except to get a ""HIGH"" or to ""SELL"" and it ruins it for the sick people!!

I get weekly neck injections and the vicodine does not help as much as this. I have to use the pain med and soma together and wow what a differece. I can actually move and have a life for a minute. If people would just take the meds like their doc wants them too then things for people like me would be better. I dont abuse my meds so why should I be punished for stupid people?,F,33,1  years,7/6/2009,Soma
106, 1, husband used it for pain and rec,My husband died from an overdose of Soma because he just wanted to escape reality for a few hours. He had been abusing them off and on for years. He ended up escaping forever at the age of 40.,This is a very dangerous drug if not used properly.,F,43, ,7/1/2009,Soma
107, 3, Sacroilitis_ Ruptured Disks_ TMJ,Soma like any other drug should be used as directed. Stupid people who abuse it will ruin it for the folks that need it. When taken as directed_ it relaxes muscles_ stops spasms and helps with sleep. When abused_ it will impair your motor functions and CAN kill you.,"People need to use their brains a little more often when it comes to medication. It is not there for ""fun"" or to abuse and when you do this_ the people with real medical issues who depend on medications in order to have an improved quality of life are the ones who suffer when the government steps in and pulls the plug. It's the worst kind of selfishness. Tolerance can build quickly with Soma and it's important that you not increase the dosage yourself when this happens. Taking a little break is the best way to handle it. If you don't need this medication for a health issue DON'T TAKE IT. It ruins things for the responsible people.",F,34,2  years,6/27/2009,Soma

109, 5, Fibromyalgia_ Back_ Broken Bones,They make you feel light headed and tired. Make you lazy the next day.,I started Soma for terrible muscle cramps. I take them usually only at night. Before Soma_ I could only sleep 2 or 3 hours a night before pain woke me up. Now I sleep all night. I found that they help all my pain_ including leg pain from sciatica_ probably associated with a fractured pelvis. They help with pain from broken bones that never healed right. I was in a motorcycle accident and had about 25 fractures_ ranging from inline fractures to overlapping ribs and collarbone. Soma works better on my type of pain than Vicodin. I have been offered oxycontin and percocet and refused them. If a person needs something for pain on a regular basis_ does that make them addicted? Is a diabetic hooked on insulin?,M,56,3  years,5/31/2009,Soma

Inconjunction with that_ there are other meds he has prescribed. I simply do not understand the juvinile mentality of abusing your meds for kicks. Most of us out here need our doctors to trust us that we are not scamming them for pills to get high!!! SHAME on those of you who do that.

It's great at first. Take three at once and 15 minutes later you feel drunk_ high and totally stoned. Ten years later_ if you're an opiate addict taking methadone daily like I am and supplementing that with as many soma as you can get_ they're not so good. We all know deep down who we really are! If you have extreme back pain or have had an accident and the Dr. gives you 30 soma to be taken once every 6 hours_ thats one thing. But if you're a junkie looking to get loaded soma are not to be messed with. Today I 16 within 12 hours and I really feel nothing. And thats a low day. I've taken 8 within an hour and still had trouble going to sleep. Wrestlers die from taking massive amounts of soma and countless other Americans do as well and it's not publisized.

I was not sure at the time who had been getting into them so starting counting them when I knew we would have people coming over. She had a previous addiction to vicodin so am very concerned. We talked her into joining a treatment center at this point so I am hoping that it goes well and she does not end up dieing from this type of addiction. All I can say is if you take this RX try to keep count of them because they are highly abused by some and if someone is addicted to them they would not be above stealing them from you.

153, 5, neck spasm_ then back/sleep,euphoria_ clumsiness_ slurred speech_ sedation_ blacking out. I don't think theirs any long term effects other than increased tolerance_ and possible addiction.,"I love the stuff_ if i wasn't more aware of my addictive behavior i would be addicted. Works great for muscle spasms_ its a pro-drug of an old tranquilizer Miltown_ so it makes me pretty tired. One pill usually takes away pain_ 2 will help me sleep_ make me feel pretty nice_ 3 and I am pretty stoned_ if i take more than that i slur speech_ and walk like i had 10 or so drinks. Works good for its purpose_ don't drink with it_ its not to safe. i would advice not to take narcotics with it or you will end up feeling like you just got a shot of morphine_ although i infrequently do. Vicodin + soma = las vegas cocktail_ codeine + soma = soma coma. las vegas cocktail is named so cause it started in las vegas police call it ""heroin high in pill form"" Soma coma feels more like morphine. So be aware soma mixed with narcotics and your on your way to a nasty addiction.",M,,2  years,2/9/2008,Soma

I took 6 somas to fall asleep (I hadn't slept in a few nights)and after an hour or so he heard a loud thump upstairs.  He found me on the floor in the bathroom mumbling and disoriented.  I don't recall any of this.  He nursed me back to myself.  I will never take soma again.  Very dangerous and life threatening.,F,31,9  years,1/9/2008,Soma
155, 1, muscle spasm,DEATH.,I just lost my best friend of 17 years to this drug. It is HIGHLY addictive! She could not kick it_ NO ONE would help her! Insurance won't cover detox because it's not an opiate...there is not enough information on it out there for rehab programs to help anyone.  It is a very sad sad drug.

156, 4, muscle pain from pinched nerve,I take 1 350mg before bed.  Very deep sleep; still feel some effects in the morning.  Some dizziness if I need to get up at night. Very mild euphoric effect similar to 1 or 2 drinks.  Appears to depress my libido somewhat and makes me feel less intelligent than usual.,My pain problems stem from thoracic outlet syndrome_ including tingling fingers and muscle cramps in the affected arm.  These are for some reason much more problematic at night; the SOMA makes it possible to sleep whereas otherwise I wake up many times at night w/ throbbing pain in triceps_ etc.  Eagerly looking forward to getting rid of TOS so that I can stop taking Soma; while it works_ I don't like feeling buzzed every night.  I've already taken my dose for this evening_ and I notice it's harder to type accurately under the influence.  I do not recommend driving under the influence.,M,49,35  days,12/10/2007,Soma

Thanks be to God and God alone_ the paramedics were able to revive him.,Please Please Please be careful.,F,26, ,11/19/2007Email,Soma
160, 5, back pain degenerative discs,a little light headedness_ mild euphoria,Wow_ it works.   I have taken every narcotic including Oxycontin.  Have taken Flexeril which does nothing.   I have been in pain for 6 years and it has come to an Oxycontin with diazapan combo to get relief.  Soma is a pleasant surprise.   I have never been addicted to all of the narcotics I have tried_ so I suspect that will continue.   I could easily see rotating this in and out with diazapan for long term use.,M,43,1  days,11/16/2007,Soma
161, 1, Back Pain,Drunkeness_ Tremors_ Passing out,My wife of 33 years is hooked on this junk. She will take her one month allocation in two week. Acts drunk_ slurs_ falls_ drools_ shakes_ burns holes in the bed and carpet then acts like a total ass for the next two weeks. Denies that there is a problem and refuses to get help. My young son called me to the kitchen one day. When I entered_ I found the room full of smoke. She had started to cook bacon_ passed out and was in the floor twitching. If I wouldn't have been there it would have been all over. I could go on but the stories are all about the same. It's destroyed our family but to leave her would probably mean her death.

164, 3, muscle spasms,Just a little out of it,I'd take it about once a week when I had bad spasms.  For me it only worked OK for about an hour if I took the 300mg dose on an empty stomach.  Otherwise it didn't do much for me.  Maybe for some mild spasms it would be OK_ but I don't see a need to take drugs for mild spasms.,M,29,2  months,10/2/2007,Soma
165, 5, muscle pain shoulder neck,"I wouldn't call anything I feel a ""side effect""",I've been taking 350mg off and on for a few years now. A single pill doesn't do much but 2 pills makes me feel great. I'm a very shy person but with soma I'm much more open. I think thats why I like it so much. I have not had any withdrawal symptoms when I stop cold turkey except for not being able to sleep good for 3 or 4 days. I'm 44 and have tried numerous meds for my shoulder pain and soma is the only thing that helps with the pain and my anxiety. I love soma. I wouldn't call it addictive because there aren't major withdrawal symptoms when you stop but it is definitely habit-forming simply because it makes everything feel better. You also have to watch how many you take. Many times I've said to myself OK only 4 today and then after the 1st one I'm taking another 2 hours later. My worst binge was 25 in 3 days and even then I worked every day and was functional and just seemed really relaxed.,F,44,2  years,9/29/2007,Soma

170, 4, shoulder pain/spasms,Sometimes slightly sedated and occasional slurring of speech; but most of the time none.,"I take 350mg with 800 mg Motrin (and sometimes Tylenol#3 or Darvocet_ also take restoril or dalmane at night to sleep - at that time I usually break 1 soma in half.)  My prescription is for 1-2 tablets 3x/day - I have never taken 2_ and about half of the time I take 1/2.  As with any medication - take it only as prescribed - and for anyone thinking they can take this with other medications or alcohol_ IT SAYS RIGHT ON THE PRESCRIPTION ""DO NOT TAKE WITH ALCOHOL.""  This is not the same as ""alcohol may increase they side effects of this drug.""  Use common sense and read the bottle!!  If the prescribed amount stops working for you_ try taking a vacation from the medication for a couple of weeks - but go off slowly_ these can be broken down into smaller doses to reduce any withdrawal side effects.  Ask your pharmacist about combining this medication with other medications.",F,43,2  years,7/18/2007,Soma

I took one at bedtime (with my normal Ambien CR_ Fiorinal & Lorazepam) and the first night I got a really wonderful euphoric feeling and then drifted right off to sleep_ and woke up feeling pretty good the next morning. I've been taking them for about 10 days each night at bedtime (no more euphoria though)_ and they've helped me sleep_ and I feel less stiff_ but I've felt very dull & dumber than usual during the day. Also_ I've been having very vivid nightmares and will probably stop taking them nightly because of that alone.

Just yesterday she took 60 in a 24hr period_ how she didn't overdose is beyond me.  She drove_ of course without my permision_ I would never give keys to a drunk_ and that it what happens when a person takes to much soma_ they become a drunk.  She can become violent_ but it's rare_ she just normaly slurs her words_ falls all the time_ breaks stuff_ and for some reason she gets the munchies.  She will lie about how many she has taken_ she thinks that no one can tell she is whacked out.  She was even pulled over by a cop and they didn't do anything cause she didn't smell like alchohol.  She will drive with kids in the car_ with no regard to how much danger she is putting them in or the other people on the road.  I get so angry when I see her this way_ I can't take it.  It's so stupid.  I wish there was a way I could get her blacklisted by all pharmacy's for this drug_ but I'm sure she would find a way to get it illegaly.

I almost died and left a husband and three children.  I have always been very tough and have no idea how this happened to me..BUT I GIVE GOD ALL THE GLORY AND THANK HIM FOR A SECOND CHANCE...IF YOU MIX SOMA WITH ALCOHOL IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS CAN HAPPEN TO YOU....MY LIFE WAS SPARED BY GOD SO THAT I MAY SAVE YOURS...PLZ DON'T TAKE A CHANCE..THINK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND CHILDREN.....,F,41,4  years,5/26/2007,Soma
176, 4, cervicogenic muscle spasms,Soma gave me a dry mouth_ and made me feel paralyzed. It gave me a strange spaced-out feeling_ and almost felt like it was causing my muscles to quiver. Also upset my stomach_ gassy and then blocked.,This drug_ at 350 mg/day_ did relieve the spasms in back and shoulders quite well. It allowed me to sleep well also. But for me_ the side effects are heavy duty_ so I would only use if the spasms are cripplingly painful. I had NO weird side effects with Zanaflex_ although that doesn't work as well_ nor with 5mg of Valium_ but that's a bad drug to come off of. So_ Soma's good for spasms but can have some disturbing side effects. AND: don't abuse this drug! If you do you'll end up a vegetable_ and ruin things for people who really need it for pain.,F,52,2  days,5/4/2007,Soma

178, 5, Neck spasm then insomia,Because of its abuse potential i periodically use it to get high,Soma saved me from a foam collar wen i injured my neck_ it allowed me to move it and function for the 2 weeks i was in pain. Afterwards i began to use it as an alternative to sleeping pills_ its somehow related to the sedative miltown which causes the drowsiness. It helps me sleep_ cures any injury i get working out in the gym_ and although i often take very large doses up to 5 at a time i never feel mentally or physically addicted wen i stop using it from time to time.,M,15,6  months,4/26/2007,Soma

Now_ about 20-30mins after taking Soma_ I feel a sudden relaxing of my muscles_ reduced back pain_ and less pressure on my spine. No more euphoric experiences (probably due to length of use and increased tolerance).,Soma (carisoprodol) is the only medication I've found_ at this point_ which actually works. Carisoprodol_ in combination with Ultracet(tramadol)_ do a great job at reducing my back pain to a tolerable level.,M,29,18  months,4/26/2007,Soma

I also have to take Lortab-10's_ and I find that taking the Soma can extend the time between the Lortab dosings_  allowing me to take less of the narcotic than if I just took it alone. I can't specifically ""tell"" it's working_ it's more like I can feel a lessening of the pain. For those who take this or any other pill to get high- PLEASE- there are people out there who are suffering because drug abusers have made it difficult for them to find relief- doctors are scared to treat chronic pain.",F,25,6  months,4/8/2007,Soma

Works best for musculoskeletal pain.,Coming from hard core drug addiction to narcotics_ Soma is light weight in my book. My association for addiction and withdrawal is craving_ physical w/d symptoms that comes from cold turkey off narcotics.  I haven't experienced this with Soma.  When I take it as prescribed it helps with the muscle stiffness and pain_ when  I don't take it_ I don't really notice any withdrawal.  I don't recommend combining it with other sedatives or narcotics_ as this can be dangerous_ and certainly wouldn't recommend mixing with alcohol.,F,50,120  days,3/26/2007,Soma

I am very disappointed in its effectiveness.  I have tried every other kind of muscle relaxer on the market.  The only one that works is Zanaflex but it knocks me out so I cannot take it during the day...I only take it before bedtime.

When I take a Soma it usually helps ease the pain enough for me to move around for a few hours. You can become addicted to them_ craving them when you aren't even in pain. And eventually you will up your dosage because you can become very tolerant to them. You must be careful when taking them. For some people_ they do wonders (like myself).

I can no longer safely enjoy Marijuana due to fear of random drug tests at work so the Soma delivers a decent buzz and I dont have to worry about failing a drug test. There is no comparison to the wonderful herb but Soma works in a pinch. It is wonderful when mixed with Codeine as it appears to create a synergistic euphoric blissful state. Luckily opiates only stay in the urine for 2 days (currently using them from a expired prescription).  Must be careful mixing with alcohol though.,M,30,7  days,2/24/2007,Soma

I've never had problems going off it_ when tapering off slowly.,There are personalities who easily become addicted to just about anything_ but many who don't. I couldn't afford physiotherapy_ however it was hard to get a muscle relaxant from the gp instead because these meds are supposedly so addictive. I've been on Soma before_ but I do find that after a while the effect is pretty non-existant. I took it as a course of treatment last summer_ it eased my pain a bit and helped me sleep better_ but I went off it. Now I want to take it only occasionally when I get very anxious_ wound up_ and stressed_ as it helps me get out of that feeling and relax so that my muscles don't start cramping and hurting (if I'm not accustomed to taking it_ i.e.). I don't think it makes you feel drunk; I much prefer the effect to alcohol. It can give good sleep too_ sometimes an alternative to the sleep meds.

I went to therapy three different times for months and when the pain kept coming back I talked to my doctor.You only get addicted just like any other drug....... you have to control yourself and take it only when you need it!! ,,F,48,8  years,10/22/2006,Soma

After he takes them he begins to slur_ stumble on his words he cant walk in a strait line very much like someone that is severly drunk. After asking him how many he took he lies and denies the fact that he did anything. He cant hear the way he speaks and refuses to listen to anyone. He is very aggressive when you try to take the pills away and always finds a way to find more _ illigaly . The more I take them away within a few days there always appears more . The withdrawls from it must be horrible since he flips out when he doesnt have them and goes to great lengs to get more.
