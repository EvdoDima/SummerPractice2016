0, 5, RA,I started on 3 pills a day then slowly up to 7. I had had gastric bypass in 2009 so my stomach was not dealing with the meds well. Plus I think the MTX was not getting absorbed enough. Was switched 3 months ago to injections. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  I am starting to feel alive again. I'm lucky enough to work at home so I take mine on Tuesday and that night and all day Weds. I am pretty out of it. But no flares or pain anymore. Fatigue more than anything. I was diagnosed ADHD 3 months prior which to me was a blessing because it helps the brain fog and fatigue during the day. It still takes a couple of hours after getting out of bed to feel my best but that's better than pain 24/7.,I learned something VERY IMPORTANT about the day you take your pills/injection from a woman on a support group that worked for me. Drink a lot of water and eat. Snack on healthy things all day. And avoid having to do any extracurricular activity Don't push yourself. I learned that twice so far by scheduling  doctor appointments and errands same day and paid for it dearly. I'm an avid horse woman and I ride a lot now. This time last year I was a mess and in such pain I couldn't ride_ barely walk and cried a lot from pain. I can use my hands now and am enjoying life.,F,51,7  months1 ML 1X W,6/15/2016,Methotrexate sodium

11, 1, Psoriatic arthritis,Brain fog. Increased incidence of flare ups. SLEEP - I could sleep anywhere at any time. Lack of concentration. No decrease in pain. And it didn't stop the damage to my joints though it was described to me as a disease modifier.  Blood work got worse month after month and still the insisted I take it.,"They don't call this bottled death for nothing. My pain never eased up. The inflammation didn't go down. The flare ups were frequent. I couldn't think straight - which is why I stayed on it for 5 years. I threw it all in the bin over 3 years ago and I've never looked back. Less flares_ less pain and my blood tests returned to normal after years of actually getting worse. My head cleared and I don't sleep all the time now. I eat anti-inflammatory foods and I can keep the symptoms at bay.  As a disease modifier Mtx sucks - an MRI still showed progressive damage while on the drug.  This drug does not work for psoriatic arthritis - don't let them tell you it does. There is an article on the net by the Rheumatological society that states that this drug does not work for PsA. My rheumatologist and doctor can't seem to hear me say ""IT MADE ME WORSE"".  I wouldn't touch this drug again ever. or any other come to think of it. I don't take anything for PsA now_ just the right foods and I have been so much better since throwing this poison in the bin. They aren't ""health professionals"" anymore_ there is no ""Health care"" - they're just drug dealers in my opinion and if you can treat yourself you should.

48, 2, Crohn's,extreme fatigue_ lowered immune system/increase in cold or flu symptoms after I take it (sore throat_ congestion_ etc.)_ dry eyes_ headache,It's amazing to read all of the comments because I've been feeling sicker lately and I thought it was from the Miralax I've been taking but maybe it's actually the methotrexate... or a combo of both?  Maybe taking the Miralax decreases the amount of water available in my body (since it pulls it to the colon) which makes me feel the methotrexate side effects more.  I'm not sure_ but either way_ I've been feeling pretty awful these past couple months.  Maybe my body is finally reacting to the methotrexate?  Or_ maybe this is all just part of the Crohn's.  Idk.

Found that taking anything with aspirin or salycilicate (like Pepto Bismal) causes severe interaction w/ MTX giving me nausea and diarrhea. I don't like it because it tough on your liver and interacts with too many things. Jury is still out on whether or not it's helping.

Take 20mg of MTX per week since March 09_ plus folic acid and colcalciferol. Starting to wean off 20mg of steroids. Blood work is coming back fine. RA symptoms largely gone.

I take 20mg on a Sunday evening and feel sick and tired as soon as I wake up on Monday morning.  I get panic attacks/palpations regular and have chest pains and cannot breath_ headaches and diarrea.  I have been to casualty 6 times with breathing problems and needed to go onto oxygen and have ecg's and at 17 years old it is no fun.  On arriving at casualty they sit on google to see what Jessners infiltrate is and the specialist will not help me or advice me whatsoever.  I need help,It has helped my jessners which is blisters and lumps on the upper part of body and face.  I have noticed that anxiety makes the lumps worse even on methotrexate.

Initially took it in pill form w/ several glasses of water-got so sick that to this day (this was over 10 yrs ago) I cannot drink water w/out feeling sick. Switched to shots that made it better. Took this for five years_ it did put me in remission and am still in remission 5 years later but then found out after breaking shoulder I had osteoporosis at age 35. Eventually found out osteoporosis can be caused by mtx. yay. However_ if you are prescribed this drug you probably need it. What're you gonna do?

109, 2, RA_ fibromyalgia,I've been taking 25mg once a week. The day after taking it I would be so nauseous and tired I can't get out of bed. I  stay extremely nauseous for the duration of the week. When the nausea finally subsides a bit_ I have to take the drug again. If I climb just one flight of stairs_ walk or stand for a long time_ I become dizzy and my heart starts to race. I'm a student and I can't afford to feel so tired and weak all the time. I can't do the same activities my friends do_ because I get too tired. I developed an underactive thyroid problem and I get stomach ulcers. I stopped taking it about a month ago_ without telling my rheumatologist_ and I'm not as tired anymore and there's no more nausea (thankfully). The pain has been worse though_ especially in my hands_ shoulders and hips. I've also gotten more headaches. But I almost prefer the extra pain to the fatigue and nausea. I want to discuss other treatment with my rheumatologist_ but she brushes off my complaints and increases my dosage,The drug didn't seem to make much of a difference. I still got really bad flare ups while taking the drug (one especially painful one in my right ancle which rendered me unable to walk properly for about 3 weeks).,F,22,2  years,5/19/2009Email,Methotrexate sodium

I take my pills on a Friday because the two days following are worse for me.  I can sleep all day on Saturday and recover Sunday.  The 20mg prevents the psoriasis from getting worse (I have it pretty bad on my legs and am polka-dotted on my arms).  For me_ I would rather have a couple of cruddy days a week than deal with the itching_ cracking_ bleeding and general horrification that comes with psoriasis.  To ebb the nausea_ I have found slim-fast shakes work best.  Plus_ you get some nutrition.  I go to a mostly vegetarian diet on the day I take MTX and the next day.  Fruit and veggies keep me from throwing up.  Meats and greasy foods seem to taste odd on those days and severely upset my stomach.  Hopefully_ some of this helps y'all,F,27,6  months,5/1/2009Email,Methotrexate sodium

149, 3, Ankylosing Spondylitis,General malaise_ nausea; also taking folic acid. Feel worse the 2nd and 3rd day after taking MTX but improvement follows prior to next weekly dose.,Had some problems initially; treatment combined with adalimumab so hard to determine root of respiratory issues. Despite it's low weekly dosage (12.5 mg) the side effects can seem profound at times. I have noticed a pattern to the side effects that allows me to better handle them. I am not sure if it is working; given the alternative to remain in pain and face progressive disability it seems worth a try. I am encouraged by comments from those that have shown improvement but can understand concerns stated from those who do not. Their are definite risks associated with MTX as well as a long clinical association with it's benefit. I think anyone who takes the drug should read about it and understand it's potential for adverse effects as well as possible benefits.

Some liver problems have also been identified.,I feel that the drug is impacting upon her whole life. She has taken so much time off from school and it criticised at school for being lazy and not bothering with work.

Get odd bouts during the week but it's better than coping with my skin the way it was and the pain I was in.,My psoriasis disappeared like snow off a ditch at first.  Was virtually clear in about six weeks.  No improvement in my joints at first.  Then my skin broke out again and the dose was put up.

My hair pre-maturely has gone grey :-( this is definitely due to MTX because my brother who is older than me still has pigment in his hair ! But I can dye it so no big deal. I feel as though I'm a little more emotional / less patient ? but that might just be old age creeping up on me. Sometimes it takes a long time for my blood to clot if I cut myself during shaving but I've got used to that now and I'm more careful. Sometimes I take the odd 5mg tablet of Folic acid but can't say that I really notice the difference.,Since being on MTX my un-stable skin psoriasis is now very well behaved and I only have a few small patches left which I treat topically with Exorex lotion (yellow_ banana based coal tar). A Huge improvement and my quality of life is 10x better ! My Psoriatic Arthrtis (PA) only effects a few of my toes and I can't help feeling that going on MTX when I did stopped the PA dead in its tracks and no new joints (thank God) have been affected since I've been on MTX. So I guess you could say I'm a happy bunny. Its a horrible thing to have to take and its a life sentance but if you weigh up the pros & cons my experience is that its worth taking the risk. For me_ its meant having an almost normal quality of life and has made the management of the two incurable diseases bearable.
