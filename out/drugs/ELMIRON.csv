1, 5, IC,I haven't really experienced any side effects. About four years ago I had a period of hair thinning_ but I cannot say it was related to Elmiron as there was no change in my dosage or anything.,It was a lifesaver for me. I got my life and career back. Before the diagnosis I was made to feel like I was either imagining my symptoms or making them up. Early treatments were with over filling the bladder and later with DMSO. Both were horrible and not very effective. I do have to avoid soda as it irritates my bladder even with Elmiron.  I only take Elmiron twice a day_ rather than the 3 times it is prescribed_ and that seems to be sufficient. I am wondering about long term effects and hope that I can continue taking it for the rest of my life as I cannot imagine going back to the pain and poor sleep I experienced before finding it.,F,70,20  years100 mg 3X D,4/29/2016,Elmiron

21, 4, IC,None initially but I have developed significant health problems over the past 10 years that I now suspect are due to this drug. I took 300mg/day when I started for horrible pelvic pain_ bladder spasm_ frequency of 20-50 trips to the bathroom per day to pee. It took about 3 months for improvement with few side effects_ it gave me my life back. I also began taking 75mg of Elavil per day and the combo worked well. I had two lower GI Bleeds prior and this was likely due to Accutane I was taking at the time. I now have a lot of symptoms_ I think are due to Elmiron but I am scared to death of the IC - which had me on disability unable to do anything - getting worse again.,I now have: abnormal bone growth (coccyx and spine_ pelvis causing bilateral hip impingement) pathologic fracture tailbone_ progressive scaring/clouding of corneas_ intermittent blurred vision_ profound sensurineural hearing loss in one ear with tinnitus (happened last year suddenly) I now need hearing aids and can only hear in certain environments. I began to suffer from severe hemiplegic migraine with aura_ skin rash - face and body_ joint pain_ elevated CRP and SED Rate_ I have gained 50lbs and look swollen_ my face shape has changed_I have had cerebellar dysfunction_ changes in nails &skin_ rectal intussuption_ numbness in thigh_ numbness and tingling in feet and one hand_ enlarged lymph nodes and salivary glands and so on. Recent research leads me to believe Elmiron may be causing a build up of GAG ( glycosaminoglycans ) in healthy tissue causing similar symptoms as those who suffer Lysosomal storage disease due to genetic mutations where they lack the enzymes needed to break down GAG's so they don't build up. Recent rat studies with Elmiron showed this phenomena_ including significant GAG in the tissue of the rectum (we all seem to report GI issues)_ clouding of corneas_ heart valve issues and more. I am still researching but have a feeling Elmiron has the capacity to cause this build up and create a non-genetic lysosomal storage disease. This needs to be investigated further.

I would tell myself_ thank god for Elmiron; ignoring the horrible side effects_ constant search for a bathroom_ and made to see a gastroenterologist every 3 months.  Year 7 I started to feel horrible.  Problems sleeping_ depression_ anxiety_ significant weight loss and then a horrible pain in left lower quadrant. Expensive medical tests_ and diagnosed with lymphacitic colitis.  I went off of Elmiron in December of 2003_ I was put on by a mental health professional low dose of effexor_ and eleavil.  Later a pain specialist added gabapentin and it has helped reduce the pain of i.c. Now that I am in menopause_ I notice some flares.

27, 4, IC,Some hair loss...I think...a bit of heartburn...and MAJOR fatigue.,An edit to my post from 1/17/09. I did so well on Elmiron (and the Lexapro + Trazadone that I eventually added) that I went into *complete* remission. No symptoms whatsoever and I could drink regular coffee every day and eat normal food...was great while it lasted. Unfortunately I pushed my luck a little too hard. After one too many flares from overindulging in coffee_ trying Adderall_ chinese red peppers_ stress...well the bladder finally gave up and now I'm definitely out of remission. Only this time I'm actually noticing side-effects from the Elmiron_ unlike the first time. I'm so tired I can barely see straight and I know it's not my vitamins or thyroid because I've had that all checked. I'm considering having my liver function checked...the severe fatigue and my recent elevated iron levels have made me suspicious. I still think it's a good drug and it IS helping_ but it would appear the lesson here is your body *may* respond to it differently from one year to the next.,F,39, 100MG 2X D,5/7/2014Email,Elmiron
28, 1, IC,"I took this drug 2004-2006_ I continue to suffer the effects from the drug.  It was a ""miracle"" drug.  It worked wonders.  I started to notice major bruising on my body_ so_ my doctor ordered a liver enzyme test.  The results as he said were ""slightly"" elevated.  He told me to continue the dose since it was a low dose.  My bruising became more severe and I ended up in the hospital for 10 days.  My platelet count was dramatically low_ so low_ that I had to go through none marrow test for leukemia.  I had damage to my liver and my spleen.  All of this was caused by the elmiron.  It took 2 years and lots of visits to an oncologist to my platelets to get back to an acceptable level.  Now_ I have heart issues. My valve is not working properly and I will have to surgically repaired or replaced.  I have 15 Aunts and Uncles_ 2 sets of Grandparents and my own parents and there is NO HISTORY OF HEART problems.I now have an inter-stem device implanted in my back which has been a non-drug life saver for me!",,F,58,2  years,4/24/2014Email,Elmiron

I finally found a urologist who did a scope and determined IC was the issue. Though rare in men_ it does occur. He prescribed Elmiron_ citing it was the only thing that will help. He did inform me that it will take up to a year to see any improvement. I have been on it a year now. I have seen a huge improvement over time. If you are just starting_ stick with it ! it isnt a cure all_ but it helps with the symptoms tremendously!

One week after I started it_ I started having blood in my stool and now do so every time. I also have noticed sores and blood in my nose the past two weeks and after reading reviews_ I'm concerns it may be the elmiron. I have been skeptical of this drug just because of the numerous bad side effects and the very low success rate. I will be discussing this with my doctor at my next appt. I've also had very ""foggy"" mind. I constantly forget things and sometimes can' t remember things at all.

47, 5, ICC,I have FM and SOO many problems (IBS_ arthritis_ CF_ dry-eyes_ etc.)_ So I CANNOT say if Elmiron is the cause of any or all,"I was one of the chosen to test this drug 24-years ago.  My wonderful doctor at SDSU diagnosed me after numerous DMSO treatments_ dilating of the urethra_ etc.._ from other urologists (and four times going into the bladder via surgery). Thank God my Urologist was off one day and the assisting physician told me to go to UCSD where they had the best urologist (gosh_ can't think of his name now). After they did the surgery (where they fill up your bladder real full to ""crack"" the wall and make it bleed)_ it was verified I had ICC.  My pain was so bad that I actually considered suicide! I had to urinate approx. 20-25 x's a day_ was up all night urinating approx. 10-times_ was a total zombie for not getting any sleep_ couldn't go on car rides_ couldn't wear pants_ and sex was so painful; plus I was a full-time working mother. Elmiron has literally saved my life and I cannot think what I would do if I did not have it.  I had to go on Trazadone due to my amnesia from FM_ and now I have a full night's rest.  I am a different person.  I DO have hair loss and several of the other side affects_ but I cannot chance getting off of this.

As most medications can cause this as well.  I have been looking to see if you can ever stop taking it as I have been perfect for a long time now and afraid to stop for fear of the IC returning. The only bummer is there is no generic for this medication.  It gets expensive with some insurances.

It is to thin now and may have to wear a wig if this keeps up.  Company is non-supportive and terrible.  I've had so many problems on this pill.  I could hardly stand up at times because it made me so dizzy.  I fell quite a bit because of it.  The ringing in my ears drove me crazy.  I had a lot of anxiety and had to go on Valium.  I got GERD so bad_ I almost had to go to emergency.  My doctor prescribe Prilosec for that problem.  My hair was falling out in clumps and it's still falling out today.  Once I got off this horrible pill_ everything cleared up and I was back to normal_ except for the hair.  This company should be sued for using this pill for something it wasn't intended for and for not posting better side effects.  My doctor never mentioned any of these side effects and said his patients didn't have a problem with it.  Well_ I guess he was wrong as you can see how many do have a problem with this drug.  I think there should be a class action lawsuit against the firm who puts out this drug.  I've tried many times writing them and they keep avoiding me.  They just don't care.

When I was 32 I could not figure out why I allways had what I thought was a uninary infection_ the doctors couldnt figure it out either.  I was in horrible pain and chuncks of blood were in my urine. Finaly I was sent to a urologist who scoped my bladder and determined it was IC.  I started takeing Elmiron along with Hydroxyzine for my symptoms.  After about three months I had a new life.  Hardly any symptoms at all.  I had to battle the side effects but it is soo worth it. They have gotten better thru the years.  I can not eat or drink citric acid without it causing burning with urination and sex causes me to have a flare up. If I have to go without the Elmiron which I have allways taken with the Hydroxyzine I start to have the frequency_ urgency and pain in the pelvic.  I can not immagine my life without Elmiron.

85, 1, IC,,For all of you out there suffering with this disease_ as I do_ I would strongly recommend that you consider herbal remedies. Juniper Berry_ Uva Ursi_ Parsley_ Dandelion Root_ Chamomile_ Cornsilk_ Gravel Root_ Bucha_ Yarrow_ Red Clover_ Chaparral work wonderfully! I was told that there was no cure_ nor drug for IC. That is what led me to my search for a natural remedy. This is not a cure though. This must be taken for as long as symptoms persist. I do not know the dossage  of each_ because I went to an iradologist (One who looks into the iris of the eye to find problems. This is not a joke! By looking into the iris_ there are dark spots_ which indicate a problem in a certain area of the body. This is not supernatural either_ as I wouldn't be part of any such thing. Look up iradology for yourself online for a further explaination_ if desired.) Be sure that you are seeing an iradologist who is experienced with all herbs and their healing properties.

I do suffer with bloating in the belly area and have just started to notice acid reflux and indigestion (again not sure if it's related to taking Elmiron_ as I have developed IBS as well.,I was diagnosed with IC about a year and a half ago_ and right after being diagnosed is when I started taking Elmiron.  I'm also taking Elmiron in my instillations (bladder cocktails)_ which I try to get 2-4 times a month.  Not totally sure if it's the combination of Elmiron being taken orally and through the instillations that are helping_ but it's helping definitely with the pain.  The ironic part of this all is when I was initially diagnosed with IC I didn't have urgency and frequency_ just grave pelvic pain and now after about a year and a half_ I have urgency and frequency_ go figure??  Due to the hair loss_ I decided to stop taking Elmiron for a while and see if any of my sides affects disappear or get worse_ but I'm still getting the instillations twice a month.  I'm not giving up because I've come a long way from where I was a year and a half ago and even though I still have some bad days_ it's definitely not as much as it used to be!

Don't understand this.  Went off Elmiron for 3 months.  The joint pain reappeared.  When I had to go back on Elmiron_ the hip pain disappeared again.  I've contacted the company that makes Elmiron about this.  Think some research needs to be done.  This may be an effect only with me.,Was in pain for about 2 years before I finally found someone who could help.  Could not move without causing pain.  Frequent urination.  Symptoms similar to others on this site.  Took a road trip of about 800 miles and found riding to be excruciating.  When we got back before we even drove home_ I'd called the doctor and went straight to his office.  Not much relief or understanding. I had a hard time finding someone who could make an accurate diagnosis and offer treatment that gave relief.  Took Elmiron for nearly 4 months before I had any relief from the pain.  My urologist started me on four 100mg capsules a day.  After 2 years_ I started to decrease my dosage since I worry about side effects.  Went to 3 pills per day_ then 2_ then 1_ and finally went off all together.  Have started back up in the last few weeks.  Only taking 2 per day now.

Three days ago stopped taking Lorcet_ increased dosage (as instructed by MD) of Elmiron and continued Phenozaforte. The pain has increased steadily as has the GI issues. Lorcet may have been the most effective medicine or may have been simply masking continuing IC pain. UPDATE: After seeing MD_ the increased pain is the result of a sudden onset of prostatitis and unrelated to Elmiron. GI is probably Elmiron related.

Between  the 2 of them_ they worked very well for the IC pain but one or both appear to have done some serious GI damage_ and I am now undergoing many tests to try to track it down.  I was OK before I started these.  For years_ I have found Zantac 150 (yes_ the OTC antacid) 2 - 3 times a day to be very helpful for my IC.  When I told my doctor_ he said_ sure_ because IC is a histamine response of the body and Zantac works against histamine.  So I went back to it.  Zantac by itself does not work as well as Elmiron_ but it helps a lot and I don't have the side effects like I did with Elmiron.

102, 4, IC,So far just headaches_ and they went away after the 3rd day. I shave my head so I'm not sure regarding any hair loss. Had to go to 3 different Urologists before I found one that knew about this drug.,I urinate 17 to 20 times a day. I'm happy if I can sleep 2 hours straight before having to get up. Problem is I brought this on myself. I went dehydrated while overseas. I'm never thirsty_ don't even drink with meals so when I started urinating blood clots that got my attention.I now have IC. Now that I know which foods to stay away from I can pretty much control the pain_ I just need a decent nights sleep.

Just make sure you find a licensed_ knowledgable practitioner.  I go once a month_ cost is $85 for about a 1 1/2 hour session.

107, 5, IC,NO side effects.,Elmiron Really helped me_ it took a few mos. I am pretty much symptom free now. Haved taken it for 16 mos_ able to cut down to once per day. Also a big help is the supplement CystoProtek_ available online.......my uro clinic says other patients report that helps them a lot too. Those who can't take Elmiron may want to try the CystoProtek....formulated by top IC researchers.,F,56, ,12/5/2009Email,Elmiron
108, 5, Interstitial Cystitis,I would say none_ but after reading everyone else's side effects_ there are two things I experience that could be attributable to the Elmiron:  I bruise fairly easily and sometimes get some really nasty ones.  I've always assumed it was because I'm borderline anemic.  Also_ I've noticed over the last two years or so_ when I get a headache (usually the result of a hangover or the flu)_ they are excruciating_ and often don't completely go away for two or three days.  Perhaps the Elmiron just makes the headaches more intense_ as I said_ they are always triggered by something else.,I now eat and drink just about anything I want.  I do notice a few things still affect me_ but this drug is fantastic!  I never experience pain during intercourse anymore and the frequency of my urination is usually normal.  I do notice if I stop taking it for a couple of days or only take it sporadically_ my symptoms begin to return.  Once I'm back on track_ they disappear again.  I will gladly keep taking it for the rest of my life.,F,34,6  years,11/23/2009,Elmiron

114, 4, I.C.,At first no side effects_ but after several months began having strong urge for BM and has stayed that way. Not diarrhea exactly_ but am concerned this might have bad consequences in the long run. Have had to stop taking it recently because IBS systoms have returned.,I have taken elmiron for five years and it has helped. No more bladder pain. Have changed my diet_ eliminating high potassium foods as much as possible. Take it three times a day_ 100mg capsules. Had to start dumping powder into the water_ though_ the capsule itself was irritating my stomach. I suffered with IBS for many years and it seemed that elmiron helped get rid of that. For a long time I felt really good and was able to enjoy eating again and had regular bowel movements. However_beginning last month_I began experiencing IBS again. When I stop taking elmiron the IBS symptoms go away.I'll be seeing my urologist next week and see what he recommends.,M,65,5  years,10/21/2009Email,Elmiron

That'll help eliminate the sore throat issue.It's the capsule itself that causes a sore throat > ( Odd ).,I did find out from my IC support group _ Elmiron is NOT a Cure for IC _ it only helps you live with it.IC is UnCurable.

118, 2, I.C,I finally started taking Elmiron a couple of weeks ago and stopped after about a week when I began to feel nausea_ diarrhea and thought maybe I had a bug since the season is changing..I also experienced abdominal pain and it seemed as though I was going to the restroom more than I had before at night. I stopped taking it and the side effects went away..I stopped because I wanted to be sure that it was the side effects and not just me feeling sick. However_ for those of you that have been taking this drug longer_ do we HAVE to take this forever? What is the consequence if the I.C. if not treated? My doctor tells me that it won't become cancer or anything terminal_ is this true? I want to make sure that if I stop taking this drug that I.C. won't turn into something WORSE!!  I welcome any responses or advice! Thanks so much!,,F,39,5  days,10/8/2009,Elmiron

Since my bladder was built back up I went off it and becoming a nervous wreak with hair loss not okay with me   I don't like the side effects_ so when I have a reoccurrence I take freeze dried aloevera pills from Desert Harvest.

I still deal with diarrhea and the other side effects are far less severe_ but if I take the medication with enough time before and after eating_ I feel normal. I still have to follow a low acid diet_ and I use Prelief which is an amazing partner with Elmiron. My IC doctor suggested it_ and the bloating and diarrhea are almost not happening. Sometimes hard to tell if weight gain is caused from IC or endometriosis that I also have but this drug has been an amazing help_ and has given me my life back.,F,26,3  years,9/14/2009Email,Elmiron
124, 5, bladder pain,alopecia which began after about 3 months; hair loss (in one unnoticeable area) stopped after one year; no impact on my historically low blood pressure; perhaps abdominal bloating,alleviated the nighttime pain I experienced that radiated down my legs; in so doing lessened frequency of nighttime bathroom visits from 5 - 6 to 1 or 2(max),F,62,2  years,9/12/2009,Elmiron
125, 5, Interstitial Cystitis (IC),None.  Frequency dropped like a rock.  Now I only have to go 25x a day.,I too am one of those rare guys with IC.  For years I thought I had a urinary tract infection_ but they kept telling me no.  Then_ fortunately_ I accidently stumbled upon an Urologist who specializes in IC.  He had me pegged in 15 min (three different tests/later confirmed after they scoped the bladder.  The doctor put me on a three drug cocktail (Amitriptyline_ hydroxizine_ and this Pentosan Polysulfate).  Doctor told me it might take a couple months to realize the effects.  Wooo Hooo!  That night I noticed it working.  This drug is great.  However_ like many I have read_ I really only need to take 100mg 2x a day.  Until there is a cure_ I would recommend you try this drug.  And if you still wake up 3 or 4 times a night_ I would ask your doctor to see about raising the Amitriptyline (50mg does the thing for me).,M,39,7  years,9/10/2009Email,Elmiron

Lots of UTIs.  Terribly strict diet.,ELMIRON works for me immensely.  I took it for a year three years ago when I was going through chemotherapy (which caused the IC).  Now that I'm undergoing chemo again_ I'm back on Elmiron_ and once again_ Elmiron has worked its magic.  I can sleep at night_ and can have a functional day without urinating every few minutes.

I have for sure almost everyday felt very sick to my stomach since I've started Elmiron_ and today I've had horrible diareah. It's been dreadful and from what I've read others have had this annoying side effect. My head hurts just about every morning and a couple of times its been unbarrable.,Elmiron has seemed to have helped my blatter a noticable amount.

It takes at least six months to begin working.  If you stop taking it_ it takes about 6-10 days before you notice_ but trust me_ you WILL notice_ as within 6-10 days of stopping_ the burning_ frequency and pain will return.

My bladder has been excellent since starting it_ although I started taking it the day after I had a hydrodestension so its hard to say if its the medicine or the procedure that have had such a positive influence on my bladder.

Three years later I can eat jalapenos_ hot sauce_ chocolate_ green tea and a little decaf coffee (though I have to be careful not to push my luck too much with those last two). So I would say yes_ it's helped big time! Both my mother and sister have been on this since the 90s and it helped both of them also.

When my doctors started insisting on cultures every time I thought I had a bladder infection_ they started to come back negative.  Then I got properly diagnosed by an expert named Dr. Harold Drutz_ at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto_ Canada.  I have taken the drug for around 3 years and very rarely get symtoms. I tried going off the drug this summer and the symtoms returned with a vengence.  The Doctor told me I may have to be on the drug for life.  Which concerns me_ but the alternative is worse_ living like you have to go to the washroom every second with burning is no life.  Also_ I did have to stick with it for a few months before it started working.

And the scariest part was when my doctor said ""they"" don't really know how Elmiron works!  And we're trusting this stuff because...???  So far_ there has been no relief from the IC symptoms_ and on this med_ I actually feel worse than I did before.  The jury is still out for me_ but I am beginning to doubt I'll make it to the 6 month mark.",,F,44,40  days,6/10/2008,Elmiron
156, 5, IC,None,My IC began shortly after menopause.  I searched for 5 years for a solution visiting several urologists who would diagnose it as bacterial cysistis.  As soon as I would stop taking the antibiotic_ the symptons would return.  My mother had experienced the same problems during her lifetime and passed away before Elmiron was developed.  My symptons were pressure_ frequent urination and terrible burning as if my bladder was on fire_ extreme fatigue and vertigo which prevented me from driving at times.  It was very dibilitating.  I finally found a doctor who diagnosed the problem_ but this was before Elmiron.  The treatment was to have my bladder stretched to break up all the built-up scar tissue in the bladder lining caused by IC (under anethesia).  The bladder would bleed and that is how the conditon was positively identified. I would get relief for about five years before I would have the procedure again.

I wish it worked faster the wait is hard and I do think symptoms should be treated during the waiting time at least somewhat!!!,It may only help 25% of patients but if your lucky enough to be in that 25% the amount of help is so huge that since we are all individuals with every single treatment that we need to give it a try.

158, 2, Interstitial Cystitis,My gums would bleed with teeth brushing.  Bruised more easily than normal.  I didn't notice any help at all with the IC.  It was like I was not taking anything.,I took 100 mg 3x's a day for about a yr._ then went down to two times a day the second yr._ then one for a few months....then came off all together.

161, 2, IC; frequent urination; severe pain,Hair loss and nausea_ but mostly BRUISING!! I bruise incredibly easily; I noticed the increase in number of bruises a couple weeks after taking Elmiron_ but after awhile the number diminished_ yet the necessity to be extra-careful remained. Recently_ I stopped taking Elmiron for a short time and resumed...and so did the bruising. For example_ the bruise of the week is 5x7 in.

162, 5, Interstitial Cystitis,Very frequent urination and terrible pain.,This medication has been a Godsend.  I would not want to live without it.  I probably have some side effects but they will just have to be tolerated.  I took it for at least 9 months with no results whatsoever and most would have given up.  However_ I am a very stubborn woman and was in much pain.  Prior to Elmiron_ it was difficult to travel anywhere without stopping every few miles.  I always spotted the restroom when I entered any building and made a note of the ones located at the front door for future reference.  Now I am completely pain free and can go up to 6 hours without urinating.  Can you believe this?  My urologist says he has over 200 IC patients and only about 10 are on Elmiron because of the waiting period for results.  This is a real shame.  I recommend you wait at least a year before giving up.  It is definitely worth it. I have lost hair but just in one place in the very back.

No hair loss_ no blurred vision_ no headaches.,The lack of sleep could be related to fibromyalgia_  but it is listed as a possible side effect for Elmiron and I'm not chancing going off it to see.  The drug alone has really helped the pain and urgency/frequency; I haven't changed anything about my diet for IC.  I am supposed to only be on it for 6 months_ so we'll see what happens after that.  I am worried about the lack of testing that has been done on this drug -- I am also on birth control and synthetic thyroid medicine_ but since no drug-drug interaction tests have been done_ I don't know how well each drug is actually working_ which is very discomforting.,F,23,4  months,4/6/2008,Elmiron

It is a life saver.  I had a bad flare up a few months ago and my doctor put me on Elmiron.  It has helped some but I can't wait to stop taking it because of the side effects.  I am still taking Ditropan and will continue that.  My doctor wants me to stay on Elmiron for at least 6 months.  I will try_ but not for longer than that.

The only flare ups I've had just invlove a little more frequency.  Otherwise_ it's been great.  I try to stick to a low acid diet but I do still drink a little coffee in the morning.

However_ I wish doctors would realize that for some of us this ""solution"" is worse that the problem.",Have had IC for several years and have felt horrible.

I am also taking detrol LA_ and some of these side effects may be attributed to the detrol_ but I started detrol one month earlier and didn't notice many of these symptoms.  I have dry mouth_ but that is a side effect of detrol as well.  The two major symptoms are diarreah and headaches.  The headaches are AWFUL and happen almost daily_ enough that I am going to discontinue my medication.  I have diarreah about three times every day and it's gotten normal for me_ but now that I think about it_ it's pretty annoying.  I think I am done with elmiron.

When I do feel like I am getting the symptoms of painful urination_ I can settle them by drinking more water.

I'm telling you this because if you have never been tested for this you might want to. It will mimic almost the exact symptoms of ic. I have a mild form of ic and can't drink soda or coffee_ but the herpes is what was the biggest problem. 1 in 5 people have it_ so I hope I can help someone who isn't getting relief and thinks there is something else going on.

Upon recommendation of another IC patient (not a physician_ though she said her physician suggested it)_ I opened the capsule and swallowed the powder alone_ with no problems at all. After doing this for a couple of years_ I very gradually worked back into taking the capsules_ and have had no difficulty for the last 3 years.,Elmiron doesn't work for many folks who try it_ but I can't say how grateful I am that this product has virtually eliminated my IC symptoms.

Gum bleed more easily.  May make one more susceptible to gingivitis due to the gums being more prone to bleeding/sensitivity.,Since 1993_ I take PolyCitra-K packets twice/day which took care of 70% of my IC symptoms.  It took 9 months to notice benefits from Elmiron_ and a year for it to reach its full benefit.

I have just been diagnosed with acid reflux and was wondering if there is a correlation between the Elmiron and the acid reflux as again tonight the chest pain was terrible about 15 minutes after taking my Elmiron.,It really is a wonder drug.  I was in so much pain for about 2 years.  The Elmiron and diet has controlled 95% of my IC pain.

Within two months_ I was just about back to normal.  I continue with elmiron today but have backed off to only two capsules per day.  Another important thing that happened was the discovery of a device called the Alpha Dry system.  www.alphadry.com  This device obvously was designed for men but I wanted to put it in here in case other men happen to read this.  The Alpha Dry system worked for me because it gave me more self confidence to venture from home.  I was very close to being house bound before Elmiron and the Alpha Dry system.

211, 4, Interstitial Cystitis,Three weeks after beginnning Elmiron I noticed blurriness in my left eye in the center of my vision.  It got worse so I went to a retinologist who mapped my retina and said I had an epiretinal membrane. Real (not laser) surgery is the only medical option other than just living with it.  I decided to take a wait and see stance.  The blurriness definitely developed quickly after starting the drug.  Three weeks after stopping the drug_ my vision improved - I returned to the retinologist who mapped me again and the epiretinal membrane was gone.  Coincidence?  That's what both the urologist and retinologist think_ but my thinking is that if the drug supposedly thickens the bladder membrane_ maybe it causes membranes to grow where you don't want them - like the eye.  I wrote to Ortho-McNeil_ but only got a standard response and so do not know if others have experienced this side effect that might possibly be correlated to the drug.,On the flip side_ Elmiron is the only drug that I have found to work and produce long-term relief from the symptoms of IC_ but I am reluctant to take it again_ fearing the effects on my vision.,F,55,80  days,1/19/2005,Elmiron
