1, 5, IC,I haven't really experienced any side effects. About four years ago I had a period of hair thinning_ but I cannot say it was related to Elmiron as there was no change in my dosage or anything.,It was a lifesaver for me. I got my life and career back. Before the diagnosis I was made to feel like I was either imagining my symptoms or making them up. Early treatments were with over filling the bladder and later with DMSO. Both were horrible and not very effective. I do have to avoid soda as it irritates my bladder even with Elmiron.  I only take Elmiron twice a day_ rather than the 3 times it is prescribed_ and that seems to be sufficient. I am wondering about long term effects and hope that I can continue taking it for the rest of my life as I cannot imagine going back to the pain and poor sleep I experienced before finding it.,F,70,20  years100 mg 3X D,4/29/2016,Elmiron

21, 4, IC,None initially but I have developed significant health problems over the past 10 years that I now suspect are due to this drug. I took 300mg/day when I started for horrible pelvic pain_ bladder spasm_ frequency of 20-50 trips to the bathroom per day to pee. It took about 3 months for improvement with few side effects_ it gave me my life back. I also began taking 75mg of Elavil per day and the combo worked well. I had two lower GI Bleeds prior and this was likely due to Accutane I was taking at the time. I now have a lot of symptoms_ I think are due to Elmiron but I am scared to death of the IC - which had me on disability unable to do anything - getting worse again.,I now have: abnormal bone growth (coccyx and spine_ pelvis causing bilateral hip impingement) pathologic fracture tailbone_ progressive scaring/clouding of corneas_ intermittent blurred vision_ profound sensurineural hearing loss in one ear with tinnitus (happened last year suddenly) I now need hearing aids and can only hear in certain environments. I began to suffer from severe hemiplegic migraine with aura_ skin rash - face and body_ joint pain_ elevated CRP and SED Rate_ I have gained 50lbs and look swollen_ my face shape has changed_I have had cerebellar dysfunction_ changes in nails &skin_ rectal intussuption_ numbness in thigh_ numbness and tingling in feet and one hand_ enlarged lymph nodes and salivary glands and so on. Recent research leads me to believe Elmiron may be causing a build up of GAG ( glycosaminoglycans ) in healthy tissue causing similar symptoms as those who suffer Lysosomal storage disease due to genetic mutations where they lack the enzymes needed to break down GAG's so they don't build up. Recent rat studies with Elmiron showed this phenomena_ including significant GAG in the tissue of the rectum (we all seem to report GI issues)_ clouding of corneas_ heart valve issues and more. I am still researching but have a feeling Elmiron has the capacity to cause this build up and create a non-genetic lysosomal storage disease. This needs to be investigated further.

I would tell myself_ thank god for Elmiron; ignoring the horrible side effects_ constant search for a bathroom_ and made to see a gastroenterologist every 3 months.  Year 7 I started to feel horrible.  Problems sleeping_ depression_ anxiety_ significant weight loss and then a horrible pain in left lower quadrant. Expensive medical tests_ and diagnosed with lymphacitic colitis.  I went off of Elmiron in December of 2003_ I was put on by a mental health professional low dose of effexor_ and eleavil.  Later a pain specialist added gabapentin and it has helped reduce the pain of i.c. Now that I am in menopause_ I notice some flares.

27, 4, IC,Some hair loss...I think...a bit of heartburn...and MAJOR fatigue.,An edit to my post from 1/17/09. I did so well on Elmiron (and the Lexapro + Trazadone that I eventually added) that I went into *complete* remission. No symptoms whatsoever and I could drink regular coffee every day and eat normal food...was great while it lasted. Unfortunately I pushed my luck a little too hard. After one too many flares from overindulging in coffee_ trying Adderall_ chinese red peppers_ stress...well the bladder finally gave up and now I'm definitely out of remission. Only this time I'm actually noticing side-effects from the Elmiron_ unlike the first time. I'm so tired I can barely see straight and I know it's not my vitamins or thyroid because I've had that all checked. I'm considering having my liver function checked...the severe fatigue and my recent elevated iron levels have made me suspicious. I still think it's a good drug and it IS helping_ but it would appear the lesson here is your body *may* respond to it differently from one year to the next.,F,39, 100MG 2X D,5/7/2014Email,Elmiron
28, 1, IC,"I took this drug 2004-2006_ I continue to suffer the effects from the drug.  It was a ""miracle"" drug.  It worked wonders.  I started to notice major bruising on my body_ so_ my doctor ordered a liver enzyme test.  The results as he said were ""slightly"" elevated.  He told me to continue the dose since it was a low dose.  My bruising became more severe and I ended up in the hospital for 10 days.  My platelet count was dramatically low_ so low_ that I had to go through none marrow test for leukemia.  I had damage to my liver and my spleen.  All of this was caused by the elmiron.  It took 2 years and lots of visits to an oncologist to my platelets to get back to an acceptable level.  Now_ I have heart issues. My valve is not working properly and I will have to surgically repaired or replaced.  I have 15 Aunts and Uncles_ 2 sets of Grandparents and my own parents and there is NO HISTORY OF HEART problems.I now have an inter-stem device implanted in my back which has been a non-drug life saver for me!",,F,58,2  years,4/24/2014Email,Elmiron

I finally found a urologist who did a scope and determined IC was the issue. Though rare in men_ it does occur. He prescribed Elmiron_ citing it was the only thing that will help. He did inform me that it will take up to a year to see any improvement. I have been on it a year now. I have seen a huge improvement over time. If you are just starting_ stick with it ! it isnt a cure all_ but it helps with the symptoms tremendously!

One week after I started it_ I started having blood in my stool and now do so every time. I also have noticed sores and blood in my nose the past two weeks and after reading reviews_ I'm concerns it may be the elmiron. I have been skeptical of this drug just because of the numerous bad side effects and the very low success rate. I will be discussing this with my doctor at my next appt. I've also had very ""foggy"" mind. I constantly forget things and sometimes can' t remember things at all.

Also_ for the past month without it_ I only experienced my pelvic pain about two days_ but had worse problems with my pain associated with early morning bathroom trips.

47, 5, ICC,I have FM and SOO many problems (IBS_ arthritis_ CF_ dry-eyes_ etc.)_ So I CANNOT say if Elmiron is the cause of any or all,"I was one of the chosen to test this drug 24-years ago.  My wonderful doctor at SDSU diagnosed me after numerous DMSO treatments_ dilating of the urethra_ etc.._ from other urologists (and four times going into the bladder via surgery). Thank God my Urologist was off one day and the assisting physician told me to go to UCSD where they had the best urologist (gosh_ can't think of his name now). After they did the surgery (where they fill up your bladder real full to ""crack"" the wall and make it bleed)_ it was verified I had ICC.  My pain was so bad that I actually considered suicide! I had to urinate approx. 20-25 x's a day_ was up all night urinating approx. 10-times_ was a total zombie for not getting any sleep_ couldn't go on car rides_ couldn't wear pants_ and sex was so painful; plus I was a full-time working mother. Elmiron has literally saved my life and I cannot think what I would do if I did not have it.  I had to go on Trazadone due to my amnesia from FM_ and now I have a full night's rest.  I am a different person.  I DO have hair loss and several of the other side affects_ but I cannot chance getting off of this.  The reason I found this site was to see if there was a proven-successful natural herb or mineral to substitute because that is the only way to go and I know that drugs do destroy other things.

54, 4, Frequent urination and pain,I didn't have any at the first couple months.  Now in my third month I have the worst gas ever....the smell lingers on.  Loose stools.  Bloating.  A little hair loss starting.,It worked immediatley.  I went from going to the bathroom every 10 minutes to every couple hours or more.  But I can't take the side effects.  My liver enzymes are already elvated after 3 months.  I am terrified of hair loss since I already have that problem before started the Elmiron.  Any suggestions on a natural remedy or diet?,F,48,90  days100 2X D,1/18/2012Email,Elmiron
55, 5, IC,Hair Thinning,I have been taking this for 5 years.  As I am on another blood discorder medication unsure if this is the reason for my hair thining.  As most medications can cause this as well.  I have been looking to see if you can ever stop taking it as I have been perfect for a long time now and afraid to stop for fear of the IC returning. The only bummer is there is no generic for this medication.  It gets expensive with some insurances.   This medication was a godsend after months and months of terrible pain with no hope in sight.,F,38,5  years100 4X D,1/13/2012Email,Elmiron
56, 3, IC,Bad stomach pain_ blurry vision_ eye pain_ headache_ constipation & loose stool. Constantly feels like I need to go #2.,In 3 weeks I already have a reduction in bladder pain & burning. I was diagnosed with IC 20 years ago & since then multiple other chronic illnesses as well. Somehow_ I was in remission for about 3 years with out any IC meds & now the IC came back_ horrible pain & burning_ I'm worried the side effects will increase & new side effects will come. Had a rescue bladder instillation & the pain & burning worsened. My heart really goes out to us all that live with IC,F,49,3  weeks100 MG 2X D,1/5/2012Email,Elmiron
57, 2, IC,"Almost total relief of IC symptoms; minimized flares and ability to eat ""problem"" foods with minimal to zero flares/pain. Flared occasionally around menstration  times. Minimized nocturia....HOWEVER - Extreme and expedient HAIR LOSS. As a 27/28 year old female_ this was devastating. In the 8 month spam I took Elmiron_ I lost 30% of my hair_ and the breakage and damage to the strands remaning was horrific. I stopped the pill immediatley.","Within 1 month of quitting Elmiron_ my flare and IC symptoms returned with a vengance....which is regrettable. 2 months later_ my hair has begun to regrow_ however the damage in the remaining strands is deep. Dyes applied to hair are also not true to color. Something in the Elmiron_ within the strands of my hair_ alter any dye. I have tried several top brands out there_ and stylists are baffled at how the ""new growth"" reacts differently than the length of my hair.... which retains Elmiron in it. It is the only medicine added and removed from my regimen that can be held responsible for all this havoc!",F,29,8  months400 2X D,1/3/2012Email,Elmiron

59, 1, Interstitial Cystitis,Terrible Hair Loss; GERD (Acid Reflux); Dizziness (Spained my ankle from fall due to being dizzy); RInging in ears; Depression_ Heart problems (fast heart rate); Anxiety.,It has been almost a year since I've been on Elmiron and I am still losing my hair.  It is to thin now and may have to wear a wig if this keeps up.  Company is non-supportive and terrible.  I've had so many problems on this pill.  I could hardly stand up at times because it made me so dizzy.  I fell quite a bit because of it.  The ringing in my ears drove me crazy.  I had a lot of anxiety and had to go on Valium.  I got GERD so bad_ I almost had to go to emergency.  My doctor prescribe Prilosec for that problem.  My hair was falling out in clumps and it's still falling out today.  Once I got off this horrible pill_ everything cleared up and I was back to normal_ except for the hair.  This company should be sued for using this pill for something it wasn't intended for and for not posting better side effects.  My doctor never mentioned any of these side effects and said his patients didn't have a problem with it.  Well_ I guess he was wrong as you can see how many do have a problem with this drug.  I think there should be a class action lawsuit against the firm who puts out this drug.  I've tried many times writing them and they keep avoiding me.  They just don't care.  Maybe they would care if they got sued.  Because all they think about is making a dollar.,F,59,90  days? 3X D,7/8/2011,Elmiron
