0, 5, Anxiety and sleep aid,I've taken this drug twice in my life and it's been a life saver each time. However_ it made me gain 50+ lbs each time. Sounds rediculous I'd take it again but it fixed all my other issues better than anything else I've ever taken. This medicine is great if u have a great handle on diet and exercise. Being small has always been easy for me as I have a very high metabolism....but I didn't stay as active as I needed to to continue this med. I've been changed to nortriptyline and it's decreased my appetite significantly and still works almost as good for anxiety and sleep :),,F,45,1  days50 mg,5/30/2016Email,Elavil

2, 4, Dr. RX  4 migraines cured anxiety!,The first month or so I had experienced side effects such as dry mouth_ constipation_ dry eyes and itching. I did not have all these side effects at one time nor did they all last the full month. It has decreased my appetite significantly. I have lost 15lbs.,"This is the first time in my life that I'm not fearful of ""something"". I'm normally anxiously awaiting an illness_ injury_ or a devastating disaster. I've never known so much contentment. I'm good with that!I still experience some migraines but not near as frequently. I'm very happy with this medicine and plan on keeping it around.",F,42,4  months25 mg,5/8/2016,Elavil
3, 4, Panic attacks & depression,Sleepiness_ but I consider that a good side effect because I always had trouble sleeping.  I also have fewer headaches and less night time itching.  The main unwanted side effect has been brain fog_ and because of that I am looking for alternatives.  For panic attacks_ I would prefer calming_ but will settle for numbing.,Amitriptyline stopped the panic attacks.  It is the most reliable thing I've tried for that.,M,58,8  years50,5/2/2016Email,Elavil
4, 1, Interstitial cystitis,This med turned me into a fat_ sugar-craving zombie. I gained significant weight_ although admittedly I was on other meds with same side effect_ so I think it was a bit of a triple whammy on the weight. Also_ it was very sedating. Even though I took it at night_ the fatigue continued right through the day without fail. That seemed to decrease a little with time_ but not a lot. I never had the least bit of pain relief. I may have had fewer migraines_ but I still had plenty of them - at least 3 days per month.,Again_ I didn't experience any pain relief whatsoever on this med. All it did was give me side effects. I just discontinued it_ so I'm not sure if I will experience an increase in migraines.,F,35,6  months20,4/25/2016,Elavil

6, 4, insomnia,After starting elavil_ blood pressure was dangerously high and developed congestive heart failure.,While it helped with condition prescribed for_ insomnia_ it caused my blood pressure to be high enough to require medication. I was also diagnosed with congestive heart failure when I had never previously had any problems. The least but still concerning effect was rapid weight gain. I gained about 50lbs in a few months. After stopping medication_ blood pressure and heart function are returning to normal. Weight gain has stopped also.,F,46,3  months50mg,4/15/2016,Elavil

10, 5, CFS/ME; Insomnia,None that I'm aware of so far. A little tired the first day or two_ but that's pretty normal for me.,I've tried many different medications for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and it's related symptoms - antidepressants_ benzos_ thyroid meds_ steroids_ antivirals_ stimulants_and on and on.I had been taking trazodone to help with sleep for several years_ but it seemed to be getting less effective. After doing some research_ I asked my doc about Elavil and he was happy to write a script.So far_ I have slept like a baby on it.  I was a little tired for the first couple of days_ but that seems to have faded.  Doc also suggested Lamictal during the day_ which I have not started yet.  I want to use just the Elavil for a few weeks to see its effects before adding anything else into the mix.,M,48,1  weeks10mg,2/19/2016Email,Elavil

14, 4, fibromyalgia,I was feeling it was harder to wake up in morning... my brain was kind of asleep for few hours... so I began to take elavil earlier and now it's better. I take it around 8PM go bed around midnight and able to wake up around10AM (I still need a lot of sleep... or maybe even a little more with elavil).No other side effect.,This week I've started to have more DREAMS :) I'm happy because I've red that dreams occur during the profond/paradoxal sleeping period which is truly good to repair/energize body and also tgat this phase would be almost not there with fibromyalgia... which could explain pains and tireness and everything (I believe)... I also feel less intense pain and I was able to go gym (15-20 min gentle elliptique + gentle hydromassage one day and gentle aquaforme the other day)...I've also change my diet: protein at each meals (gruau/Brown rice/quinoa/small lentils) this is to help muscles... plus green tea instead of coffee (i cut coffe to once or two a week only... like week-end coffee only... and green tea all other times)... I also cut ALL form of stress... and turned my mind into the more positive I can be even if fibromyalgia is truly hard to accept... well... I believe elavil is helping me and I want to keep it as low as possible.,F,35,6  weeks10mg,1/12/2016Email,Elavil

18, 2, Depression,Significant weight gain_ drowsiness_ hyper realistic dreams,Honestly_ I notice the most significant difference in its effect on me if I skip a dose.  I've taken it 13 months now_ and I barely feel different.  It helped a very small amount_ but if for some reason I miss a dose_ I feel 5 times worse.  The dreams are strange--extremely vivid.  All five senses totally engaged.  You feel every single thing as though it were actually happening.  I've always had strange dreams_ but I've never felt as much in a dream as I did on this medication.  Sometimes it's just weird_ but it's often unpleasant (dreaming about being stuck with needles or getting sick or being punched or choked--you feel it even though it's not actually happening).  Last week I took it very late at night (around 1-2 am) and lost the whole next day sleeping.And of course the weight gain.  I was gaining more and more weight even though I hadn't changed my lifestyle.  Did some research_ sure enough_ weight gain is a side effect.  I'm wondering if it's time for me to talk to my doctor about weaning off.,F,21,1  years50 mg,11/23/2015,Elavil
19, 1, Nerve pain in legs and anxiety,I am someone who never gets angry or feels rage_ but since taking this drug I have felt horrible anger and irritability_ this is so not me!

20, 4, General anxiety and social anxiety,"I began 10mg of Elavil (amitriptyline_) once per morning. On the first day_ it took approx 30-45min before I felt much more alert and felt relief from tension. My anxiety usually makes my facial muscles and lips very tense.  Elavil reeve the tension in my face and lips. If tension at its worst is a 10_ Elavil reduced it to about a 5. I was suprised.My anxiety will usually have my handwriting looking terrible when I'm anxious. When I write now_ my handwriting isn't shaky as it used to be. My hand and fingers are much more steady.My thoughts feel less rushed. I'm not on ""overdrive"" as I usually am.  I feel that I can take my time with tasks or when speaking.",I would like to increase my dose to 20mg. I've read that many find Elavil sedating so they take it at night. I take mine in the morning. I doubt I'd sleep at all if I took it at night. It makes me feel wide awake_ focused and calmer at the same time.,M,41,2  weeks10mg,10/25/2015Email,Elavil

25, 5, IBS,A bit groggy in the AM_ otherwise no other negative effects.,I was prescribed this due to my IBS. I had been struggling with mysterious stomach issues for the past several years_ following a strange 8 month long stomach virus. Recently found out what I've been experiencing lately has been ibs. It seemed like every other day there was something going on with my stomach - whether it was nausea_ constipation_ diarrhea_ or just an overall sick feeling. Totally interfered with everyday life_ as I never knew if my stomach would act up. Amitriptyline helps me tremendously. I never experience stomach issues anymore_ and I am MUCH more regular; I love it. I feel normal again. I do take it at bedtime though because it puts me to sleep.

The day after my first bedtime dose I woke up shaking and could not stop crying the entire day. Second day I was worse and very irritable with high anxiety. Third day I missed work due to panic and the shaking. The medicine did help relieve my pain but just was not something my system could tolerate. If you can tolerate it I recommend giving it a go for fibro pain. Every medicine is different for everyone.

62, 4, Sleep Aid : Help falling asleep,I take 10 MG 2-3 hours before I want to go to sleep. I have struggled with falling asleep not staying asleep for most of my life. I'm also taking Well Butrin (anti-depressant) and have struggled with depression and addiction. However_ I take this med to help me specifically fall asleep. Lunesta and Ambien do not work for me. Benedryl or Zzzquil work for me better than prescription sleep meds I have tried. I would be open to trying Trazadone again.  Melatonin doesn't work well for me either because I have nightmares on it. I love this med and know that when I have it- I will be able to sleep well. I also do not feel groggy or a hangover like effect in the am. The only thing is concern about my weight. I am unsure of side effects.

Completely cured a life of insomnia and anxiety and what must have been underlying depression. Since changing doctors and countries_ I ended up on Remeron (no effect)_ Mianserin (no effect)_ and then trazodone (helped with the insomnia). Then a new pdoc tried me on Cipralex_ which worked on the social anxiety and depression but left me with zero sex drive and insomnia again. Then even the antidepressant effect seemed to wear off. So I tried generic amitriptilyene again. First at 25mg and now at 25mg in morning and 50mg in evening. Again_ it's worked and I'm amazed at the difference.

I was prescribed this medication for intermittent insomnia due to early onset of perimenopause.  There was no groggy feeling for me the next day_ and I feel it helped me sleep well.

It seemed to have a diuretic effect for me and reduced bloating. Foods did taste different_ mainly coffee. I missed my morning cup. My eyes and mouth were dry and I did crave sweets_ however I am not sure if Elavil was the cause. I did start to sweat on my face to where I was dripping wet every day (It is a very hot summer_ though.) My vision got blurry with floaters and I felt dizzy often and sometimes too tired during the day. My heart started to feel like I was having palpitations and I found myself getting upset and angry and shaky inside.,I have been weaning my dose from 20 mg to 10 mg over the last few months.

I still need a heart work-up to see the effects of the Elavil and my eyes are still dry and blurry with floaters. I may need to wait a few weeks to see if these clear up or if they are permanent. I recommend going off Elavil if you experience the palpitations_ shakiness and anger. I actually started 5-HTP (an over the counter product in the vitamin isle) and it helps my mood_ sugar cravings and sleep a little bit. I am not sure if it is compatible with certain medicines.,F,42,1  years20 mg 1X D,7/27/2011Email,Elavil
118, 5, Insomnia,None,I've had severe insomnia for 15-20 years. I'd never taken anything for it but I finally decided to talk to my Dr. about it.  He prescribed Ambien and one other.....don't remember the name of thw 2nd one.  I didn't like the way either one of these made me feel.....with each one it took me until lunchtime to really wake up.  He thought Elavil might be worth a try and it has been like a miracle for me. I take 100 mg. 1 1/2 to 2 hours before bedtime.  I fall asleep within 10 minutes and sleep a full 8 hours every night and feel great.  After all those years of very poor sleep I feel like a new person!!!  My only concern now is how long my Dr. will let me keep taking it......I can't bear the thought of going back to 2_ 3_ or 4 hours of sleep night after night!,F,73,2  months100 mg. 1X D,7/23/2011,Elavil

Extreme fatigue and uncontrollable shaking and nervousness.  I have take Lexapro and Zoloft in the past and was off all anti-depressants for 3months before starting the Elavil. Its a horrible old drug_ it actually caused me to feel fear from leaving my house to going into any public place and facing people or a crowd. I actually thought I was developing agoraphobia until I stopped the Elavil.  I would NOT recommend this medication for anyone.

Until I read all of these reviews about people experiencing similar side effects_ I didn't know what was causing this. I am on 75 mg which was the dose it took for me to stop having migraines_ but the weight gain is unbearable. I have been taking relpax for the onset of migraines as well as the pill continuously (not having a period) to control the migraines which seems to be working.

Since then I am down to 1 migraine per month instead of 10-12 per month. This drug makes you very sleepy_ but for me this was a plus. I have had insomnia for 24 years and this has cured it. Drowsy in the morning_ but it goes away about 30-45 minutes after I waken. It's worth it to be able to sleep at night and for fewer headaches. My dreams are extremely vivid when taking this. In fact_ I sometimes can't remember if I dreamed something that happened or if it really did happen. A little weird_ but kind of cool and not a deal-breaker for me. It does make me crave sweets and I gained about 5 pounds at first. But with a little determination and increased willpower_ I was able to lose that weight.

There is no question that the medication is the culprit. Concentration and not as energetic as I was before the medication.,The first three weeks on this medication was tough. I was very drowsy and felt like I was not cognitively on my A game.  After the three weeks these symptoms subsided. What really helped is taking the medication earlier in the evening and taking it at the same time every night. The medication has absolutely made my IC pain subside and because of the medication my quality of life is pretty normal except for some dietary changes.  So for IC pain I would much normal i would recommend Elavil. I am concerned about long term use but for now its doing its job. An added bonus with this medication that I was not expecting is how it has mellowed me out which has been a good thing. I have noticed that previous things that made me anxious like_ public speaking_ flying_ embarrassing situations does not bother me to the same degree as it did before taking the medication. .

I attribute that to getting the pills wet when I first wanted to start cause I didnt want to take and were going to throw away or possibly due to the fact that one of the doctors at my hmo prescribed 10 mg of valium a night to sleep cause I was to afraid to take any newer drugs and then taking one a night for five years which was horrible to get of and a big misjudgment on my part so I find this to work good with moods anxiety etc have always had a low level depression and hesitant t,I My depressed feelings lifted away within a couple of days and felt so much better  in about two weeks.

I have wanted to ask my doctors for years what is best medication for pot addiction but my last HMO they put in my chart I was a drug user even though I do not drink do any other drugs and  mostly shy away from prescription meds all together of any kind so have been afraid since to ask.

It does help me sleep. I am a severe insomniac and if I am not on elavil I can stay up for days and days.

Then_ it progressed to my kids waking me to ask if they could go to a friend's house and me waking up the following morning panicky because my kids are gone. Now_ it has elevated to me sleep walking and being told about it from my 19 year old son. I am considering talking to my doctor to switch me to something different.

He prescribed me this as well as tramadol. My diaherrea associated with my IBS has been drastically reduced_ but tramadol may have combined to make the situation better. I am not sure.Sleep became much easier early on. However_ more recently I have become a little more dependent on it and have built up a tolerance.

Had none of these issues before taking.,Really worked for my bladder and back pain within the first two days_ thought it was a miracle drug!

164, 2, chronic neuropathy C5/6 disc slips,demotivated_ changed personality_ cardiac arrhythmia_ loss of libido_ drowsiness,Amitriptyline helped me get a good night's sleep whereas before I had been waking every hour or so from chronic pain caused by 2 severe disc prolapses in my neck. But_ the drug rapidly altered my personality and within 2 weeks I no longer recognised the person I had become. I was very confrontational and would see the negatives in everything. I was demotivated - at home and at work_ and completely uninterested in sex despite being married only 6 weeks. At bedtime I would have significant heart arrhythmias - 1 missed heartbeat for every 10 normal (I do already have a minor history of occasional atopic heartbeats). Combined with the constant drowsiness_ I decided to stop the drugs and put up with the pain and lack of sleep. My mood improved greatly within 2-3 days_ but the libido hasn't returned yet (after 2 weeks). I was also taking atarax and ketoprofen at the time.,F,37,3  weeks2mg 2X D,9/16/2010,Elavil

It made me extrememly tired at night_ so I started taking it at 8:00pm in order for the side effects (tiredness) to wear off by the time I left for work (7am). It took about 2 weeks to adjust completely. Those first two weeks I felt groggy_ disoriented_ and had trouble focusing. I was taking it to prevent migraines (with visual disturbances) and it was working until I began to work out extensively. I was migraine free for 5 months_ but recently had a migraine with aura. I figure if I still have migraines on amitriptyline_ why take the drug? I have stopped taking it for about 3 days and feel a little disoriented_ but not as bad as when I went on it. I had trouble sleeping last night_ but I am hoping it was just because I am back to work after having spring break. I noticed a slight weight gain (5-7 lbs) and that I have to work out daily in order to fight weight gain. I have had a serious sugar craving that I am able to ignore only if I am preoccupied.

Use Benadyl alone when not experiencing anxiety/depressive symptoms. Obtain relief of moderate anxiety/depression after taking twice a day (within 1st or 2nd day). Usually take 1-2 hrs before bedtime(or earlier_to allow 10 hours to clear my system)if I have to get up early the next day. Only take a dose in the morning if needed for anxiety/depression. Once fully awake and functioning_ morning dose does not make me sleepy. However_ may fall asleep if not mentally and/or physically active. Was already on hypertensive meds_ but had to double dosage a few months ago and still BP remained higher than expected. Noted that BP within normal range on days Elavil not taken.  Wish I'd been aware that extreme weight gain was a side affect.

Just showering is so much work I have to lie down awhile to stop the sweating.,I first started Elavil because I suffer from so much pain following a car wreck 21 years ago that I could not sleep.  Although the doctor thought it would help the pain_ it didn't_ but I could at least go to sleep at night.  I have tried different doses_ but 25 to 50 works best.  More and I sleep through the next day.  I have a glass of water with me at all times for the dry mouth.  At first I was still able to achieve an orgasm_ but as time went by I lost my libido_ and for the last 3 years can no longer achieve an orgasm no matter what I do.  About a year ago I started having problems with sweating.  If I try to do any activity_ I start sweating so much that it just pours off me.  So much that people in the store have asked me what is wrong.  Talk about embarrassing.  I have been trying to figure out what was causing it_ and began to suspect the Elavil.  So I weaned down on my dosage and stopped taking it a few days ago.  I am hoping I will still be able to sleep at night.  I also don't want to live anymore without a sex life.  The past couple of years my Pain Specialist has done 4 procedure to burn the nerves in my back.  This has helped the pain and muscle spasms enough so that I may be able to sleep now.  We'll see how life goes without Elavil.,F,57,5  years50 mg 1X D,2/7/2010,Elavil
204, 3, sleep disturbances and depression,I was taking trazodone for 10 years to treat my sleep disturbances but my Dr. was concerned about possible long-term effects so she switched me to 50mg amitryptiline (Elavil) one year ago. I was finally able to sleep through the night again and I did not feel groggy when I woke up (but I did allow myself at leat 8 hours to sleep). My energy returned and I was very happy with this drug. However_ some of the side effects are really bothering me. I've learned to live with the dry mouth and I have not had any significant weight gain_ but my short-term memory is getting so bad I wonder if I am in the early stages of dementia sometimes. I lose my train of thought in the middle of a sentence and no amount of reminders will help me remember what I was trying to say. I will leave one room to go get something but forget what I was looking for by the time I get to the other room. This happens many times every day. I also have a hard time coming up with words when I am talking. Some might attribut,,F,54,1  years,2/2/2010Email,Elavil

210, 4, Vulvar Vestibulitis and Migraines,I just started taking Elavil last week.  I had to take one 25 mg tablet for a week and then as of two nights ago I had to up it to two at bedtime.  It does make me extremely sleepy but taking it at night helps me sleep.  The day after I first took it I noticed that I became extremely irritable and angry to the point that even the announcer at the supermarket bothered me.  I've not had that happen again since.  I've also woken up twice in the past week panicked and gasping for breath.  I think I was dreaming but I'm not sure.  I don't know if this is as a result of nightmares from the Elavil or my sleep apnea (I've never had the apnea wake me up like that before).  I've been having bad dry mouth in the mornings but it goes away after I drink something.,As to whether or not it works_ I don't know yet.  My husband and I have not been able to consumate our marriage as I have too much pain and hypersensitivity (I waited until marriage to have sex.  We've been married now for little over a year.)  While we haven't fully tried to have sex yet_ we did fool around a bit and normally when he uses his finger it gets to be uncomfortable and bothers me.  This time it didn't hurt or irritate me at all so I'm a bit encouraged that the medicine is actually working.  As for preventing my migraines_ I haven't had one since I started taking it but it's only been 9 days.,F,30,9  days,1/8/2010Email,Elavil

Apparently at higher doses there are more risks.Elavil made me feel more energized and focused for about an hour and then made me promptly fall asleep followed by waking up in a haze- it was a positive feeling though. I also have taken zoloft_ and elavil has way_ way more of a sedative effect.After a few days_ the dizziness went away but so did the positive effects. I took it for chronic pelvic pain but it did little to relieve that condition_ though I hear that it has helped others. It did prevent headaches_ though. Not a bad drug but I feel that there must be better ones out there.,M,25,2  weeks,1/8/2010Email,Elavil

I don't have to worry about sleep driving and wrapping my car around a telephone poll and not remember any of it. I don't like the groggy feeling the next day but better than no sleep at all. I'm 5'6"" and have always weighed 114 lbs and have never liked sweets (I like salty food). I just ate almost an entire 1/2 gallon of ice cream in one sitting tonight. I'm 45 and have never done this before in my life.

Still had several migraines a month so decided it wasn't worth the side effects to stay on it. I used to take a nap every day-now that I'm off I don't feel the need to sleep so much AND I lost the weight I gained.

216, 4, sleeplessness_ anxiety,DRY mouth_ some weight gain_ difficulty forming thoughts and getting words out when speaking_ occasional rapid heartbeat,I started taking 50 mg of Elavil at night to help me sleep and relieve anxiety. It worked great for those two things! The dry mouth is the worst. I am a teacher and I talk all day. I usually pop a sour lemon hard candy and keep a water bottle handy at all times. The weirdest side effect has been the difficulty I have getting words out of my mouth; sort like writer's block for speakers. Rapid heartbeat is very infrequent. I have had two UTIs in the past three months - very unusual for me as the last one I remember was 15 years ago. I did gain about six lbs since I started taking it. I crave any kind of food with a bold flavor - sweet_ salty_ hot_ etc. The doctor suggested I drop to 25 mg and I will try that starting tonight.,F,54,3  months,12/9/2009,Elavil

But if I take the medicine at dinnertime instead of bedtime_ it helps completely.  Weight gain of about 10-15 lbs without any change in diet (from 120 lbs to 130-135 lbs) unless I exercise consistently.,Had severe and debilitating migraines with aura about 4-6 times a month.  Had a scary ER visit after trying Imitrex_ so decided to avoid abortive approach and try the preventative approach with Elavil.  Started on 10 mg daily and had one tiny migraine in the first year.  Had a few small migraines in the following year.  After almost two years on Elavil_ migraines started to increase in frequency and intensity to about 4 medium to severe headaches a month_ so about a month ago I started taking 20 mg.  Haven't had a migraine since then_ but I'm feeling lethargic in the mornings again and have noticed a slight weight gain again.  I will take the medication a little earlier in the evening and exercise more_ and it shouldn't be a problem.  This drug has been a wonder drug for me.  I used to live in constant fear of a migraine striking_ and after using Elavil I feel like I have my life back.,F,31,2.5  years,11/25/2009Email,Elavil

I hate the instant weight gain. I've also been on the thin side so it's weird feeling fat on me. Am debating whether to keep taking it as I love the sleep but HATE the weight gain.

No drowsiness at all the next day.,This drug has given me a new lease on life. I am on a very small dose at bedtime. That's all I need to ease my anxiety and depression_ help me sleep well_ and keep migraines under control. My doc was reluctant to prescribe such an old time med_ but no other AD worked for me. Finally_ I asked to just try this. He relented and prescribed a small dose. It made me too sleepy (drowsy next day) so we went even smaller. That did the trick. Wonderful drug! I am so full of energy and clear thinking and steady emotions now. Maybe it isn't prescribed enough because docs think it takes so much to work and patients can't stay awake at those dosages. But at least for me a small dose was all I needed to stabilize me. I'm so glad I tried it_ and tried it at lower dose. So glad I have a doc who will really listen to my feedback.

229, 3, Major Depressive Disorder,Anticholinergic/antihistaminic side effects of sedation/fatigue_ dilated pupils_ perpetual yawn.,Had high hopes that dirt cheap amitriptyline would work alongside 10mg daily Lexapro to provide that norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitor push that I seem to need in addition to the serotonin one. **Seeking alternatives to Effexor_ which was a hell of an addiction to kick after three years of its just-too-short half-life (daily brain zaps while on regular treatment_ anyone?)** So started @ 50mg/night for one week_ tried to move up to 100mg as suggested by psydoc but could not tolerate the sedating_ suffocating feeling I tend to get with anticholinergics so after one night of that went back down to 50mg. One more week on 50mg and I'm still yawning all day long and sleeping even more than I normally do which is already too much. Waited for side effects to subside_ they didn't in two weeks. Chronic fatigue is a major part of my illness_ as is chronic pain. Amitriptyline at this dose greatly increased my fatigue which was already significant_ but it also controlled my lower back pain incredibly well. I had actually almost forgotten about the back pain (!) until end of 2nd week reduced dose to 25mg and next day was still fatigued and yawny_ pain came back_ though not in full force. Next night I discontinued it_ which was the night before I wrote this_ and I am still yawning. I'm not giving up on this drug yet_ but I am going to clear my system of it for a week or so and then try re-introducing it at a dosage more common for chronic pain like 10mg.,F,29,2  weeks,8/23/2009,Elavil

I have also tried hypnotics_antidepressants and other sleep-promoting drugs but all of them failed. Now finally I sleep almost 8 hours uninteruptedly. Elavil has also enhanced the effectiveness of the SSRI I currently take. I feel calmer_ my obsessive thoughts are minimized ang generally I am better than I have been on the SSRI alone.

231, 5, IC_ pain_ sleep_ mood,3 lbs.,This info is IC sufferers: I had IC both in my late 20's and then again about 2 years ago. I'm 45 now_ but when I had it in my 20's there was not even a name for it so I suffered and live on Peridium for about a year until things slowly settled down. When I got it again it made my life even more miserable. I was on Peridium Plus_ Elmeron_ Elivil (50mg)_ Zyrtec and some other bladder control drug I can't remember_ and 2 different antibiotic for after sex just in case_ and an antiacid for acid reflux. The only drugs I now take are the Elivil and Zyrtec at night. I drink a coffee call Kava which is instant and is super low in acid. The reason why I'm writing this is to tell IC sufferers I got better not because of all the drugs_ but because I did physical therapy. I went to PT because I had pelvic floor dysfunction. And that was the root to my IC. I did months of PT once a week and after about 6-8 months I became symptom free. I still watch my diet_ use Prelief for acidic foods_ eat gluten free_ and take the antibiotic and Peridium when needed. But over all I am in remission. So if you have not tried this therapy I suggest you do. IC is horrible and can ruin your life. I hope this helps!And I tolerate Elivil fine_ I take it at night. I went off last summer but got back on in the winter because I needed it to get though my husband's deployments and work trips.

It does help me sleep - no pain. I do get very tired at times_ but discovered that I am anemic_ vitamin D deficient and low on B12. So I take a B12 shot every month_ take vitamin D and chelated iron and pay attention to what I eat. I have an endocrinologist who helps me with my Type 2 Diabetes and my hunger. We added the medication Symlin (injection pen) to my insulin treatment - it's a hormone that most people with diabetes are deficient in; it keeps the food in your stomach longer. I'm not hungry all the time and I have lost weight. I do have to monitor my energy level though and I drink lots of pure water (I'm a waterholic connesuer) and the chewing gum help,I take the generic form - Amitriptyline. After reading about the different types of side effects from other ant-depressants and pain meds_ I very grateful that I can take Elavil and have only dry mouth and fatigue. All of wich are manageble for me_ at least now I know what was causing the dry mouth and possibly contributing to the fatigue. I hope that this gives hope to others out there.,F,48, ,7/22/2009,Elavil

I think I may need to d/c this med.  I was on it once before for a couple of weeks or less and I ended up overdosing on it and lunesta.  I've not been able to tolerate anti-depressants and I've tried almost ALL of them.  I thought I'd try it again at the 10 mg dose instead of the 25mg I was on before but I don't think these side-effects are good for me.  I hate to poo poo any IC med but I don't feel safe.  I'm not drowsy either.  Maybe even hyper.  Anyone else like this email me.  thx.,F,36,6  days,6/19/2009Email,Elavil
245, 3, Migraines and Night Leg Pain,"My Dr. started me out on 50 mg. at bedtime_ and though it helped me to sleep_ I also had very vivid dreams and very bad ""pill hangover"" for hours after waking up the next morning. I went down to 25 mg. and have stayed there now for about three years. I haven't noticed a decrease in the amount or intensity of my migraines_ but it did eliminate the night leg pain I was experiencing. I would like to go off of it now to see if it would return since it isn't really helping me to sleep but when I do I have dreams that are sometimes upsetting.",,F,55,3  years,6/15/2009,Elavil

I am up to 150 mg that I take every night before bed. I have found that I am sleep dependent on it now. I was feeling so good a few summers ago I thought I could stop taking it cold turkey. This was a bad idea..I was manic..had anxiety attacks and couldn't stop thinking about my own mortality. As soon as I started taking them again all that went away.

Am trying to take the Elavil a little earlier than bedtime and don't seem quite so tired in the morning.  So far it has been beneficial.

Pain Mgmt Dr. diagnosed me w/nerve damage from having 6 inch kidney cyst drained (2 pop cans worth of fluid)_ filled with alcohol for 1 hr to scar it. It deadened the nerves on outside of kidney. They re-generated 18 mos later & sent severe pain signals to my brain. He told me on 1st visit I would need a neurostimulator implant (normally used for back pain/failed surgeries-- Jerry Lewis has one) but had to fail 3 therapies 1st.  I failed them_ but took 4 months & 3 denials before ins. OKd the implant trial. Finally had neurostimulator implant_ outpatient_ quick surgery 14 mos after sudden pain. IT WORKED!!!

There are some helpful saliva substitutes on the market_ like glandosane and biotin_ but nothing is as good as your own! will continue on this treatment - it has also decreased my appetite (or maybe it's all that water I'm drinking filling me up!) - hence I have lost some weight_ which being over-weight is a good thing for me!,F,,2  years,3/2/2009,Elavil

I wasn't prepared to put up with that situation so i took control and was prescribed amitriptyline_ which has been proven to prevent migraine attacks in clinical trials. I was prescribed a very low dose of 10mg (normally 50-150mg is used for depression)and it has been brilliant.

296, 3, Fibromyalgia,Dry mouth_ grogginess in am for first few weeks_ weight gain_ decreased sexual appetite,I have been seeing a Rheumatologist to treat my Fibro and we have been doing a lot of experimenting to see what works for me. About three months ago he put me on Elavil_ it has really helped with the insomnia I have been experiencing_ and after a few weeks I wasn't feeling as groggy in the morning. I finally felt rested_ which was very nice_ but it has somewhat decreased my sexual appetite which is quite frustrating. I noticed right away that I wanted to eat EVERYTHING_ I have gained about 10-15 pounds_ given that the Fibro keeps me from being able to be as active as most normal people_ I have tried to adjust my diet to eat healthier and try to avoid the urge to snack on candy_ chips_ etc. Elavil has helped with the insomnia and depression that comes with Fibro_ but I'm still not totally sold on it given the side effects.,F,27,3  months,8/24/2008,Elavil
297, 1, depression/anxiety/headaches,extreme increase in appetite_ craving for sweets_ weight gain,I was already on Lexapro when prescribed Elavil.  I really don't see any improvement since first taking elavil.  I still have my headaches and the weight gain has made me decide to slowly ween myself off of elavil.,F,19,4  months,8/15/2008,Elavil
298, 3, Chronic Headaches - Some Migrane,Sound/Deep Sleep_Grogginess_ Weight Gain,Prescribed Elavil for headaches - already on Lexapro for anxiety / panic attacks.  Had headasches that lasted for days_ and would then go into a migraine (with visual and auditory sensitivity).  Has worked well for headaches_ but have put on 10-15 lbs in a month and a half.  Not happy about that.,M,51,7  weeks,7/23/2008,Elavil
299, 5, Depression,Fatigue,Although I don't take Elavil anymore_ this was the only medication that helped me with severe depression_ insomnia and anxiety.  The side effects were strong at first but they diminished with time.  After a few years I went off Elavil and am now depression and anxiety free.  No regrets.,F,33,5  years,7/16/2008,Elavil

301, 4, nerve damage in head,The only side effect I had was if I didn't take a Xanax with it at bed time I had really BAD nightmeres...like Freddy Cruger style!,I was taking this because I had something in my head burst and the Doctors cant find what it was_ but it left nerve damage in my face and head. My head hurt to even touch it and my face was all numb and tingly. It didn't help the pain at all_ but it made me sleep really good and I felt rested the next day. I don't sleep well to start with_ but just the pillow touching my head hurt so I wasn't sleeping at all for about 5 mounths. Then my doctor put me on this and on Xanax because I was having so much anxity from the pain and the doctors not knowing what popped in my head. the first night I took it I slept sooo good I asked to stay on it. I actully have to get Nerver blocks in my head to control the pain. But I have to take Xanax with it so I don't have nightmeres.,F,41,2  months,7/10/2008,Elavil
302, 3, vaginal pain,weight gain_ about 10 pounds in 6 mos.  Constantly tired,I was on elavil for 6 mos...I did feel some relief_ although the weight gain was enough to make me stop it.  My doctor says there is no other drug I can take that would help the itching and burning.  I have an appointment at the University of Michigan end of July.  Hopefully they can make other suggestions and help me figure out what is wrong with me.,M,32,6  months,7/7/2008,Elavil
303, 5, Depression/Anxiety/Insomnia,Slight weight gain_ taste/smell distortion at beginning of treatment,I love this medication!  I started on it to help me come off of some other medications I had been on for several years (Ambien_ Restoril_ Klonopin).  It helps greatly with overall mood.  I have a get-up-and-go attitude that I'm not used to having.  It balances me out very well.  It has helped with endogenous depression_ anxiety_ and insomnia.  I sleep like a baby and have not had a panic attack in months_ even though I am no longer on sleep/anxiety meds.  The only thing that I am not too thrilled about is the slight weight gain...but it is worth it.,F,29,2  months,6/24/2008,Elavil
304, 5, Chronic migraines,Initial symptoms included severe somnolence_ heart palpitations_ difficulty in waking up_ vivid dreams. Did help significantly with insomnia_ however_ this effect wore off. With tolerance over time_ the medication helped tremendously in reducing both the frequency and severity of migraines. At 75mg_ the only major side effect is dizziness and lightheadness when standing up.,,F,24,2  years,6/14/2008,Elavil
305, 2, Anxity Depression,severe weight gain.,I would not recommend this to anyone who is weight gain sensitive.I gained 18 pounds in 2 months. It took the anxitey and depression away I actually felt good but now Im fatter than I already was and I have got to figure out a way to loose this extra weight.,F,43,2  months,6/12/2008,Elavil
306, 5, depression_ fibromyalgia,dry mouth and drowsiness is all I can remember_ if I had others they are long gone,I like this med because it helps with my fibro_ which is a bonus_ not what it was originally rx'd for. SSRIs make me manic and tricyclics like amitriptyline do not. It has not cured the depression_ but seroquel with it helps. I take 150mg at bed time.,F,27,3  years,6/1/2008Email,Elavil
307, 3, depression neuropathy insomnia,weight gain_ sleeping 12-15 hrs per day,Definitely helped with the neuropathy; I went from walking with a cane with an escort to being able to go about my life normally. Also helped with my anxiety. Medication was being used in conjunction with robaxin and ibuprofen and alleve. However_ I've been almost unable to do anything other than the very basics of life-go to work_ come home_ let the dog out_ eat maybe_ and then back into bed. I was told by the doctor that this was simply a function of depression. Upon reading other people's review of this medication I find myself astonished to  discover that this is not necessarily true_ and am very angry with my doctor. My sleeping has caused arguments with my husband_ who is military and on a very early morning routine. I will be switching if it's possible.,F,20,1  years,5/28/2008Email,Elavil
308, 3, anxiety and depression,To me_ this kind of worked like Paxil_ but a bit mellower. I got off of this because I couldn't stand the excessive sweating! And all over! My feet were a bit swollen also_ yep_ just like good ole' Paxil! It did work a bit better than Paxil_ though. Not bad for an oldie but goodie!,,F,34,3  months,4/30/2008,Elavil

Also_ dry mouth_ constipation and decrease in libido.,I have taken elavil on two different occasions_ both for neuropathic pain (once in arm_ again in abdomen).  Started at 10 mg. each nite and worked up to 50. Am now weaning myself off it all together.  In both instances it worked quite well_ side effects notwithstanding.  I slept quite soundly and could easily sleep till late morning.  Upon waking_ however_ I felt quite rested_ moreso than ususal.  I had tried neurontin first in both instances with no effect.  Much preferred the results with elavil.,M,56,3  months,4/21/2008,Elavil
310, 5, fibromyalgia,Dry mouth (sometimes)_ irregular heart rate (when drinking caffeine)_ and inability to lose weight(it took me 6 months to loose 12 pounds when working out).,I was diagnosed when I was ~20 years old. My doctor put me on elavil_ 5 mg at bedtime.  I am now at 30 mg at bedtime (and have been for the past 7 years). I tried to wean myself off of it twice before (I don't like taking pharmacuticals)_ but almost died from the pain. I think this is a great medication for me. I could not live my active life without it. I also take many supplements/herbs to help with my pain.,F,32,12  years,4/20/2008Email,Elavil
311, 1, Depression,Started out at a low dose for three days (can't remember the mg).  Dose doubled after those days.  Immediately after the dose went up I started having some kind of nerve problem.  Namely_ the whole left side of my body _from heel to tongue went completely numb.  I was afraid I was having a stroke.  Didn't take anymore after three days of this_ and the problem went away the day after I stopped taking.  Strange!!,It is worth mentioning that I can't tolerate most antidepressent drugs.  They have no effect on the depression but plenty of the unwanted side effects.,F,38,6  days,4/16/2008,Elavil
312, 1, TMJ pain,Dr suggested I take 10mg Elavil at night_ building up by the 2nd week to 20mg's. It did help to alleviate the TMJ pain but I became incredibly_ deeply_ darkly depressed_ lost all motivation_ felt foggy headed all day and my craving for eating sweets was totally out of control. I could see myself getting fatter by the day.I tapered back down to 10mg's - stayed there for one week_ then tapered down to 5 mg's and then stopped but it took me close on three months before I felt 'mentally stable' again. This medication seemed to totally crush the life out of me. I was like the walking dead while on it.,,F,51,6  months,4/14/2008,Elavil
313, 5, interstitial cystitis,dry mouth_ sleepiness_ increased appetite in the beginning,This medication almost completely relieves my pain. Additionally_ since the pain was keeping me awake at night_ I sleep much better. If I do wake up_ the medication helps me go back to sleep quickly. I sometimes have a hard time waking up in the morning. But the elavil has make it possible for me to go through the day painfree.,F,50,3  months,4/13/2008,Elavil

Shaky/jittery_ seem forgetful and just not myself. Also getting irritated easily. though NO weight gain_ bad taste in mouth_ constipation...all this and more after only about 5-6 days of taking it.,I have been sick with vomiting/nausea/diarrhea for over 9yrs. I have thrown up at least 3-7 days out of the week since getting sick. Been to numerous doctors with no diagnosis. Dr. suggested Remeron but made me depressed and have weight gain so I switched to Elavil and didn't even realize that what I've been going through were side effects until I started reading here and noticed I had almost every side effect listed. This did not work for my illness either so I see no point of taking it any longer. I would not suggest this to anyone but I'm sure it could react different with each person... I'm hoping that I wont have bad side effects when I stop taking it.,F,19,6  days,4/13/2008,Elavil
315, 2, Fibromyalgia_ sleep aid,I have only taken 2 10 mg doses so far. Basically I felt drugged the whole next day even though I took my dose between 7-8pm the night before.....I also had weird dreams. I am supposed to give this a 2 week trial before deciding it doesn't work for me_ but I would basically have to take Dexedrine or something the day after to wake up! Not even sure I can take those two together!,As with most meds_ I always like it if it comes in very small doses. Also_ for me samples are probably the way to go since I am so sensitive to everything...samples at doctors offices seem to be a thing of the past (at least where I live).,F,41,2  days,4/9/2008Email,Elavil
316, 2, Anxiety,Groggy in the morning_ severe weight gain in short amount of time_ increased appetite,I was on a low dosage of just 10mg for several months_ but recently my doctor increased the dosage to 100mg because I was still suffering from anxiety. After just two weeks on the 100mg_ I gained nearly 10 pounds. When I wake up in the morning I feel completely exhausted; as if I had not slept all night. The anxiety has improved_ but now I feel depressed over the weight I've gained and how tired I always feel. So basically_ I traded one symptom for two.,F,36,1  days,3/30/2008Email,Elavil
317, 1, sever ibs,weight gain_ migraine headaches lasting several days_ high body temperature_ sugar and carb cravings_ night sweats_ nightmares_ dry mouth_ dry eyes_ depression_ blacking out 2 hours after taking the drug_ increase in breast size_ elevated blood pressure and constant thirst (even though i drink 3 litres of water a day).,"In Sept '07 my dr. prescribed Elavil telling me that it helped with ibs_ and that it would not have any side effects other than some drowsiness. He also informed me that I would start at a low dose (10mg)_ and then every couple of weeks it would be increased until my pain began to go away_ and my symptoms began to subside. So I did as the doctor instructed. But as time passed_ I began to gain weight. When I brought the issue up with my GI dr. on several occasions_ he said ""you can stand to gain a few pounds"". It took until February 2008 to get to 100mg which made me fractionally better than before_ but I didn't feel great. I was also experiencing other side effects that I didn't think came from taking the drug until I found this website. In the 6 months that I have been taking elavil I have  gained a total of 25 lbs.

321, 5, Insomnia_ neuralgia,The only side-effects I've experienced were after taking Elavil for a year & quitting cold-turkey - I had a strong paranoid delusion that lasted about 1 week & a gradual return of nerve pain in my teeth_ shoulders_ knees & back. I had no immediate interruption in sleep_ but the insomnia also gradually returned after about 6 months off Elavil. If I only have time for about 6 hrs of sleep_ I wake up slowwwwly & am quite groggy & dizzy for about a half hour to an hour. It does absolutely nothing for me on the nights when I am just not sleepy.,This is the second time I've taken Elavil on a long-term basis. I've always had lifelong insomnia - both wakeful insomnia where I am physically exhausted but just not sleepy (sometimes for days)_ and early-waking insomnia where I wake up after 3 or 4 hrs & then cannot go back to sleep. I went through sleep clinics & found I was waking up when REM sleep would begin (it explained why I could never remember dreaming - I actually wasn't dreaming at all). Elavil doesn't make me drowsy_ but it helps me stay asleep past 4 hours_ I have & remember dreams and if I am awakened (the doorbell_ the phone_ the bladder) I can go right back to bed & fall back asleep. I've also always been depressed_ but I have no noticeable mood-lightening or lessening of anxiety_ but it also doesn't get any worse.,F,34,2  years,3/1/2008Email,Elavil

I gained probably 15 pounds. I remember having one awful dream of my getting into a car accident and waking up on the ground looking down and seein my leg was gone and i was laying in a pool of blood. It was so vivid and real_ I swear i thought i was actually dying. I was super pissed about the weight gain_ I had leukemia when I was on this drug because the chemo made my headaches worse_ so i thought from sitting around sick all the time my metabolism slowed and thats why i gained weight. so i tried to lose it by cutting back about 700 calories a day_ and going to the gym. i did not lose a fucking pound. when the more sever effects happened recently (palpitations_ throwing up_ etc) i was taken off the drug cold turkey with no withdrawal effects. i hope hope hope that the weight will start to come off easier now with my diet and excersize. this is a bad bad drug that made me very sick and fat and i hate it! if anyone has taken this dru,F,17,10  months,2/26/2008Email,Elavil
324, 1, chronic pain_ anxiety,At first Elavil made me sleepy which I liked because of the relaxation. Over time it began to make me feel awful. I was exhausted all the time and not thinking straight. I was gaining weight even though I was dieting_ then my hair began falling out. I was so bloated my rings didn't fit and I went up a shoe size. When I stopped taking it I lost 5 pounds immediately. The withdrawal was very unpleasant. In the end_ this medication made my anxiety and depression worse. It did not help with pain at all.,I wouldn't recommend it.,F,53,1  years,2/14/2008,Elavil

After that period_ I've had no side effects.

Tried Remeron for 2 months and gained 14 lbs along with other side effects.  Since ridding the remeron and taking elavil I've lost 3 olbs in a few days! the bloating is much better too. Low dose of 10mg on Elavil hoping this will do the trick?  Also_ just got diagnosed with thyroid disease and started medication.  That should also help the weight gain issue and maybe even the insomnia?  Anyone suffering fatigue and cold hands etc check out your thyroid levels! I've had this disease for yrs! and it went unchecked!,10mg helps get to sleep after about 2hrs.  Wakings during the night but able to return to sleep.

Jittery; shaky hands; dry mouth; coated tongue (yuck!),"My primary care physician recommended this related to insomnia_ muscle pain and depression (which she felt was at the crux).  I do not plan to refill this script nor take it any longer.  As a mental health practitioner_ I took it related to sleep issues which I have had all my life (the depression_ I felt_ was circumstantial as my father was dying and I was caring for him).  She stated that she had been prescribing this ""for years"" and it worked very well.  Perhaps for others but the trade off was not worth it for me. I did take this for two weeks to see if these were side effects that would wear off with time....they did not.

I liked how it helped me to sleep solidly and it did seem to help my hand pain_ but it wasn't worth putting up with the side effects. I felt like a zombie at work everyday (I would take the Elavil before bed) and when I got home all I wanted to do was get in bed to take a nap. So I was wasting my life away taking naps. The drowsiness didn't go away even after my doctor suggested that I lower my dosage to 1/2 a tablet. Also_ the gross chemical taste it would leave in the back of my mouth would stay there all day long and give me rancid breath that would make my husband wince when he'd kiss or get close to me. But by far my main reason for quitting Elavil totally was it would make me get angry_ annoyed_ or upset all the sudden for no reason. Being a woman who has to deal with the usual couple days of PMS every month_ I didn't want added edgyness in my life. See-ya-later Elavil. I wouldn't recommend it.,F,25,3  weeks,1/25/2008Email,Elavil

On the rare occasion that I do not take it before bed_ I have weirder vivid dreams and hallucinations than when I do take it.,After I got used to taking it (a week or so) I loved it.   It totally relaxes me enough to sleep with pain....even after 10 years.    It doesn't 'keep' me asleep anymore_ but it still helps me to easily fall back to sleep.,F,40,10  years,1/21/2008,Elavil

I self medicated with aleve which worked good for a while_ then my dosage need increased in order to control the burning and painful spasms. This made me worried about the cardiac side effects of aleve. My urogynecologist  prescribed me Elavil. I started @ 5mgs. I'm now maxed @ 75 mgs. and I'm so happy_ I don't have to worry about having an accident or if my adult diaper is obvious to others. I can now sleep up to 8 hours and dreams (supposed to be therapeutic for cardiac and mental health). Over all I'd say I'M HAPPY taking elavil.,F,50,6  months,1/20/2008,Elavil

Worried about the dreams though - if it can do that to your brain on a low dose what's it physical and mental changes are going on. Concerned I can't wake in the morning until the dream sequence has finished.sometimes can tell dream from reality causing confusion in a morning.

But I'm so exhausted all the time (whether it be from the medicine or from my job) that I don't have a sex drive anymore to see if it's working! My fiance says I've become much moodier over the past few months. I don't know how much longer I will be on it. But one positive is that it helps me fall asleep.",F,22,3  months,12/7/2007,Elavil

However I am trying to lose weight as recommended by my GP and I just have to ignore the hunger pains_ I have lost over 2 stone now while taking amitryptiline so it can be done_ it's very hard though and much slower than it would be without the meds.Overall_ I think it is worth the effort_ better than lying awake in pain.,F,51,6  months,11/17/2007Email,Elavil
343, 2, Migraine prevention,Weight gain_ dry mouth_ dry eyes_ constantly sleepy.,"I've been on this drug for 4 years now (25mg pills). I have decided to quit cold-turkey. BAD idea. Night terrors that are horrendous and morbid_ thoughts of harming myself in ways that could kill me_ fits of unexplained crying (sobbing crying)_ a total feeling of uncaring about anything around me_ uncontrolable muscles twitches_ high level of anxiety and the list could go on and on. I never noticed this drug helped preventing any of my migraines. I became ""addicted"" to it in order to help me fall asleep at night. If someone had told me what the withdrawl would've been like_ I'd NEVER have taken this drug in the first place. I've been told that_ since I'm 4 days into a cold-turkey detox_ to keep pushing thru; to go back on and ween off slowly would be a huge step backwards. I suggest a weening off type of detox_ if you're looking to quit taking this drug.",F,39,4  years,11/7/2007,Elavil

It helped me tolerate my pain but didn't make it go away - the drug usually wore off by about 3PM. Now_ I started taking it again on 25mg this time and after 5 days_ it hasn't worked at all.  It has just made me SO depressed_ irritable_ can't stop crying_ retain water weight_ and SO tired.  Needless to say_ I am saying goodbye to Elavil.  For me_ it did more harm than good.,,F,19, ,11/7/2007,Elavil

I have always been slim_ and I gained 10 pounds the short time I was on it. Despite that_ migraines_ irritable_ and then finally severely depressed. My family made me seek the reason_ and my doctor and I determined that it was the Elavil that caused my break down.

One night I fried 2 eggs_ burnt them_fried some scrambled eggs_ tho I realized I was in a drugged state I did not have control of my actions. very scary; i could have burned the house down.  I went back to 50 mg with no problems.  It may not have been the Elavil by itself as I am also on Lyrica_ Methadone_ percocet_ valium_ and vicodin.  However_ the side effects I mentioned above did not occur until Elavil was added to my drug treatment to try to ease the chronic pain of arachnoiditis--neurological pain from numerous back surgeries_ spinal cord stimulator implant and revisions_ etc.  My pain mgt doc thought the elavil would help the increased leg/back pain at night that comes from the arachnoiditis and felt it would help with the nerve ending pain.  This pa,Believe I will be going off the Elavil and switching to Cymbalta.  It has been recommended to me by my neurosurgeon and another pain mgt doc.

I was taking Maxalt MLT but was running out before my insurance would allow me to fill it.  I tried Elavil and did not last more than 2 weeks.  My symptoms were so severe_ I could barely get out of bed in the morning.  I am an active_ early riser so this was very much out of character for me.  When I did get out of bed_ I had crazy cravings for sweets.  I had nightly vivid nightmares.  It was absolutely awful!  Beta-Blockers (Propranolol) have worked much better_ without the side effects.

358, 3, Sciatic Nerve Pain,Dry mouth_ very vivid dreams_ hallucinations_ brain fog_ drowsiness_ cravings for food,I moved from Tramadol to Elavil b/c the Tramadol was too expensive.  The move was somewhat beneficial: the Tramadol was better for the specific pain I was/am having_ but the Elavil is much more economical - go figure.  The hallucinations only occurred once.  Dry mouth is constant_ as is the brain fog.  Supplementing with B-complex seems to ease brain fog.  I never feel rested - this could be because now each night I have several dream where I REALLY feel like I am living in the dream - kinda bizarre.  Overall a decent choice_ the side-effects are undesirable but manageable.,M,25,2  weeks,8/22/2007,Elavil

These sx went after a week. After two weeks on the drug_ I experienced a migraine. Pharmacist told me that it should have worked by now and to speak with my doc. Haven't taken it since. Have had no migraines since! (i.e. after a month).,This med is now considered by migraine specialists to be archaic in the prophylaxis of the disease. It's relatively safe and it's cheap_ which I imagine is why it still gets prescribed. I feel that I may have slept a little better on this med. But_ to be honest_ the very best cure for my migraines is total avoidance of any triggers. Given that my triggers include virtually all external stimuli (from sound and light to noise and the ordinary business of life)_ it seems that I am_ in our culture_ very disabled. I'm trying to make the point that maybe we get migraines because we are not physiologically designed for_ nor have we adapted_ to the crazy demands of 21stC life.,F,52,14  days,8/18/2007,Elavil
360, 5, Painful Bladder Syndrome (IC),"I was diagnosed with Painful Bladder Syndrome after a sudden onset of pain and burning that lasted about 3 months. I was in constant pain and miserable and depressed because I was scared that I would never feel ""normal"" again. I felt helpless. It was awful. They were the worst 3 months of my life. When I started Elavil_ for the first few months I was always hungry. Gained about 10 pounds. Craved sweet junk foods. Dry mouth in Morning. It goes away after an hour or two. Groggieness in morning but I seem to be able to shake off the morning grogginess with exercise. Take it before bedtime because it makes me sleepy. Started on 25 mg went up to 50 and now I'm on 75 - and have been for several months. Hopefully this is the magic number because I've been pretty much pain free (as long as I stay away from too much caffiene or artificial sweeteners) I make sure to drink plenty of water. It helps with the dry mouth and it's good for you to boot. I believe the more active  you are_ the",I've always been skinny and very active so now I just try to watch what I eat (junk food wise) plus I run and exercise daily. Instead of eating sweet junk food_ I'll eat sweet good food (fruits). Sometimes I'm still hungry_ but I think I've got it under control. I'd rather be 10 pounds heavier than in pain!

My doctor and I had to adjust the dosage a bit until I found a dosage that worked for me (currently 100 mg/night). I initially didn't know that difficulty urinating was a side effect so that caught me off guard. Overall_ though_ this drug has made a huge difference in my life for the BETTER. It's great to not have trouble sleeping anymore. I take the pill about 3 hours before I want to go to sleep and I can usually fall right asleep.,F,27,10  months,8/9/2007,Elavil

It works_ but I cannot cope with the side effects.  I have been taking 10 mgs a night for one week_ but I have just stopped taking this pill and resumed taking Lyrica.  I want to take the Elavil_ as it gives me relief.  The side effects_ however_ take too much away.  On Elavil_ I don't want to do anything.  I feel unbelievably sad.  Near despair_ at times.  I can't stop snacking on candy_ sugary cereal_ ice cream_ chips_ popcorn_ and so forth.  In fact_ ""regular"" food appeals to me not at all.  The dizziness is embarrassing.  My heart rate has been shooting up to 107_ even when I am just sitting in a chair trying to deep breathe.  I really have mixed feelins about this 'broad spectrum"" medicine.

366, 2, Interstitial Cystitis and IBS,Weight Gain,I began taking Amitriptyline (Elavil) about 3 or 4 months ago_ and my Dr. increased my dose up to 50 mg. per day.  It was supposed to help with both my interstitial cystitis and possibly my irritable Bowel syndrome.  The first thing is that it didn't help with either one of these_ and secondly it has caused me to put on close to 20 pounds in such a short period of time.  I'm a short person with curves so i always weigh in at the upper limits of what's healthy for my size_ but to add on as much weight as i've added_ has made me feel uncomfortable in my own body and unhealthy.  My doctor has had me gradually decreasing my dosage over the past 3 weeks and as of tomorrow i will be off it completely.  I would seriously recommend looking into this medication as much as possible before taking it as a lot of people have experienced this same weight gain problem and there are other medications to try.

I couldnt do anything. A worthless day. I took 25 mg. whcih my dr. said was a low dose. Reading other posts_ it doesnt seem that low of a dose. It did help with my pain_ though.

I have gained 30 lbs and tried everything to lose it! Diet_ exercise_ you name it--I'm doing it. I'm a NP and still didn't realize the amount of weight gain this drug could cause. Also_ my heart rate randomly goes up to about 150 while at rest for no reason.,Anyone with cardiovascular problems or weight issues should strongly consider if they want to use this medicine. After the weight gain and heart issues_ I will definitely use extreme caution before recommending this drug to anyone.The initial reason that I took the medicine was for the chronic abdominal pain which was linked to my IBS_ but further testing and surgery showed that I also had endometriosis.

No more_ no less.  She thought that would knock me out of my insomnia cycle.  I was definitely able to fall asleep and sleep through the nights starting from about the second or third week.  I also appeared to have fewer/less intense migraines/It also helped alleviate the sever cramps that I get with endometriosis.  This was an added bonus.  I haven't had pain free periods in almost 15 years.  I stopped taking Elavil about two weeks ago without weaning off of it.  The worst side effect that I had was a migraine for 3 solid days.  I didn't realize that it was attributed to that until after my migraine and I looked back on it.  I wish my dr had told me to wean off of it.  I also have experienced insomnia every night since stopping except when taking Ambien.  I am going to seek another alternative even though this did work well for the amount of time that I was on it.

I read here that someone else tried much smaller doses with some success_ and wound up taking 2.5 mg a day(!)_ with decent results.  I still had headaches occasionally but much less often and for shorter duration than previously.  Also_ it was unexpectedly helpful with several other problems_ including insomnia_ periodic diarhea and urinary continence.

All this on a 10-mg dose.Took intermittently for 2 years_ then upped it to every nightduring a period of extreme stress. ,It's great for sleep-- I have terrible insomnia without it.But taking it every night seems to be too much. I'm tired of feeling stupefied all the time_ and seriously worried about the irritability and anger(rage might be a better word). Seems too easy to blame a drug for my mental state_ but I think Elavil is definitely contributing to it.,F,56,3  years,5/29/2007,Elavil

I started taking it at 21 for migraines_ it helped my migraines greatly Howver_ ver the years I took it I became overweight_ I slept for 15 hours at a time_ I felt like a zombie when awake.  I went to the doctor numerous times about my sleeping so much_ and I figured the weight gain was just me getting older and eating more etc.   The doctors always told me ""you dont excerise enough"" or ""eat better"" or ""your depressed"".  Not one doctor ever thought it could have been the Elavil.  So one day I was searching the web because I was considering raising my dose of Elavil since the doctor had told me_ once again_ that I was depressed_ while searching I stumbled upon a website like this.

During the day I can tolerate the pain_ but it's very difficult to sleep when your leg hurts.  Elavil eliminates the pain and helps me sleep.  I absolutely love it.

This winter_ it was day 4 when my days became normal again. I have my life back. 20 years ago I took the Rx for 30 days_ this time I tried it for two weeks and stopped.

Flushing/photosensitivity.,As a treatment for chronic pain elavil has been great_ although I have had to steadily up the dose over time. As a sleep aid it is fantastic. The downside is the difficulty in waking up in the morning. I have an esophageal motility disorder which has definiotely been better whilst taking elavil. However despite the benefits I am now slowly weaning myself off this drug. The weight gain in particular is intolerable. Ironic that the side effects of a drug that is most widely used to treat depression is provoking that reaction in me! Also the dry eye syndrome is driving me nuts! In many ways I will miss this drug_ but continuing with it is no longer an option.

I am at 50mg per night_ and I am going to cut the dose in half each night for a week and then into 1/4 so I do not have withdrawal.

My complaint was throat congestion_ most noticeably after eating.  Since 1999 I've been plagued with chronic throat clearing and IBS.

I almost had an accident on the way to work_ because I was so tired. The groggyness lasted all day.

I was in much greater pain and my sleep was less restorative without it. I really was a wreck. Then I started to take 25 mg at night. I skipped most of my other drugs or decreased them_ but I do have to take a sleeping pill as well in order to sleep enough (my insomnia is really severe after 8 years).

Some medecines seem to speed you up_ causing insomnia but maybe increasing your energylevel. It works for some_ but can be lethal for others. I am one of those who are energetic by nature_ but my body cannot cope with my speed. So I need something to slow me down. It seems Elavil is one of those (maybe also therefore causing constipation and tiredness in some). I have chronic diarrhoea_ which is typical of people with a faster way about them_ always apt to changes and no tendency to gain weight.

434, 1, Migraines_ depression,Horrendous weight gain.  I gained 100lbs in a year and probably would have gained more if I hadn't made my doctor take me off it.  I was ravenously hungry all the time and could eat an entire cake by myself.  It also increased my anxiety to unheard of levels.  I couldn't leave the house_ I was near suicide all the time.,Not the right drug for me at all.,F,33,1  years,10/10/2006,Elavil

437, 5, Sleep/Fibromyalgia,The first night I felt dizzy in my sleep_ that was gone afterwards.  It caused me to have a delay when I would use the restroom (which was nice in a way because it kept me from using the restroom 3 times a night).  All side effects wore off after I adjusted to the drug which took a week (I started off on 10mg_ I've been told it's best to work your way up to avoid unpleasant side effects).,This changed the way that I sleep.  Never in my life had I slept so deeply which all but got rid of my fibro pain.  I was prescribed only 10mg at the beginning.  After 2 1/2 years however it has stopped working.  My doctor has up'd my dosage to 20mg.  Eventually though I'd like to switch off of it for a while so I can come back to it and have it be effective again.  This drug greatly improved my quality of life for well over 2 years due to the better sleep (which the sleep clearly was one of the root causes of my fibro_ brain fog_ etc.).,M,28,2.5  years,9/12/2006,Elavil

My husband said I had turned into a different person. I had constipation so bad and no laxatives helped me. I had dry mouth. My appetite increased_ all I wanted to do was eat. I had sharp pains in my eye. Lights at night were purple and still are_ 3 days after stopping drug. Bad medicine for me. I stopped 3 days ago and already I feel like a new person_ like my old self!

Certainly works to help keep me asleep.The original dosage was 25mg twice a day. Well_ I tried 25mg the first night and said_ ""never again"". The grogginess was too much.Next bout of insomnia I tried half a pill. Still too muchso I tried 1/4 pill. Now we were getting somewhere. That was about 20 years ago. Now I'm up to 50mg at night.I still wake up with a bad attitude so I just don't speak to anyone for about 30 minutes then I'm OK.

I would suggest this med to anyone who needs help falling asleep and staying asleep_ also it has greatly reduced my headaches_ not fully but a big difference. I was not as groggy on the 10mg but that didn't really help with my headache and neckache so i went to 25mg which did help but i was really groggy in the am but i also do not get enough sleep_ only about 6 hours so you may not feel groggy if you get a full 8 hours.,F,31,3  months,7/12/2006,Elavil

I have been suffering for 15 years with migraines and have tried numerous drugs from all classes and nothing but Elavil has worked.But because I have gained so much weight so quickly_ my doctor is having me taper off now.

First dose of elavil 10mg I didn't even know where I was_ it was a nightmare.  Cut the dose in half to 5mg to start and slept like a baby_ always felt really calm and great.  Love this drug_ but had to go off of it after 10 years causing me to pass out occasionally from low blood pressure.  I miss this drug_ I never felt so good in my life on this.

The 1st night_ I had a night terror_ the next 2 nights I had both nightmares and auditory hallucinations (I heard voices outside my bedroom of my kids fighting one night_ even though they were both fast asleep. The other night I heard my husband calling me_ but he was asleep next to me.). The last night I took this pill I had a very awful dream and woke up to visual hallucinations. I saw the image of a demon/monster type thing in my closet_ looked up at my ceiling to see skeletal hands_ then saw a dark figure move through my room. I woke up my husband who sat up with me until it all subsided and I was able to coax myself back to sleep! I am a 36 year old Mother who's NEVER done drugs and I don't drink. My mind does NOT work like this. There is no doubt it WAS the Elavil! I am not telling anyone not to try it. For many_ it sounds great.

449, 3, 20 migraines per month,Fatigue_ difficuly urinating_ severe stomach pains (taking 40mg each evening before bed),Elavil brought my 12-year old daughter's migraines down to 5-6 per month. She had been on it for 15 months when we believed her frequent stomachaches were due to the Elavil. We abruptly stopped the Elavil (unwise!).  This caused a 21-day migraine which we could not get rid of with Imitrex nor Zomig nor anything.  My daughter was also vomiting daily in the shower_ and sometimes several times in the middle of the night.  She was dizzy and stumbling around.  She was dropping things_ like juice containers.  She essentially spent three weeks on the couch_ sleeping a lot.  We had to take her out of school.  We have since put her back on Elavil (30 mg before bed) but she is again having trouble urinating even when her bladder feels very full.  We're going to try Topamax!,F,40,17  months,5/5/2006,Elavil

It is the sixth antidepressant that I have taken in the last 12 years_ and it is the only one that has made a dramatic improvement in my life.

Without it- I am up ALL NIGHT and feel even more achey.  Recently went to 50mg from being able to dose as needed between 10-30mg.  Doctor did say was safe to take up to 100mg per dose-BUT 4 seemed to work for me_ so we just went with the 50mg.Other than groggy feeling- helps alot with getting deep sleep-can remember my dreams now-which means I am sleeping deeper and better!,F,30,5  months,4/6/2006,Elavil

It works well for sleep aid and overall calming_ but as I always do_ I had bad morning hangover effect.I did gain weight and had some problems with overeating.,Taking this or other medicine causing dry mouth can give dental probles so extra care was needed-sometimes a saliva substitute.**problem-I believe this RX is used for pain and nueralgia's also--well for me this meant that Degenerative disc desease in my neck went undetected IN my opinion because of the medication's nerve pain properties.  I've been off it for 2 years and sonce then have discovered how much pain I have & I now need major surgery (corpectomy) for my neck (I am only 38_ this is an unusual case of severe degeneration) ? could I have had a lessor surgery_ I believe so if I hadn't used this drug for so long.  *Just one person's experience.,F,38,5  years,3/20/2006Email,Elavil

This will last for a couple of hours and then I will fall asleep for my normal 3-5 hours per night. Feel like crap.

I know exactly when this drug went into effect.  I had a panic gripping my chest that lasted the next 2 weeks!  I stopped sleeping and was having to take Ambien 10 to go sleep.  I could tell that the symptoms were getting worse and called my neurologist and stopped taking Elavil.  I'd rather have the headaches!  The increase in sex drive was a nice side effect!

459, 1, Sleep disorder,Pain and burning in fingers and toes_ rapid heartbeat_ excessive sweating_ flu like symptoms_ dry mouth and eyes_ uncontrolable muscle twitching and tremors primarily in my legs_ tinnitus.,I was prescribed 10mg of Elavil a night for minor sleep apnea in the hopes I could get some restfull sleep while using my CPAP.  Well this medication did help me fall asleep and probably increased my restfull sleep but the side effects were just too much.  About 2 weeks after I started taking it_ I started feeling a burning pain and stiffness in my hands_ fingers and toes.  Then came the excessive night sweats_ headaches_ rapid heart rate_ increased blood pressure and general malaise.  I came off of Elavil 6 weeks ago and the pain_ burning and tingling in my hands has gone away although I am still feeling the effects of withdrawal.  I still have minor trembling and twitching in my legs and some mild dry mouth.  This medication ruined my life for over 4 months and I would never recommend taking it.  It may work for some of you_ but the side effects were too much for me.,M,44,4  months,2/18/2006,Elavil
460, 5, Fibromyalgia Syndrome,Morning grogginess_ low energy_ minor weight gain & difficulty losing_ insomnia on higher doses.,I have tried many different drugs to treat my FMS_ but Elavil (10 mg.) is the only one that made enough positive difference to make the side effects livable (I tend to get every side effect on the books).  I have tried 2 times to stop taking it_ but my sleep is restless and less restorative and my overall pain increases slightly without it.  My doc also increased the dose to 25 mg. once to try to help with another problem_ but I noticed insomnia immediately.  Gradually increasing the dose helped (unfortunately the problem wasn't solved).  It has been very helpful for me.,F,33,10  years,2/15/2006,Elavil

462, 5, Fibromyalgia Pain and Depression,Some dry mouth_ but it appears that this is getting better after a few weeks on the medication.,I did not respond at all to SSRI's.  For years_ I was bounced between different ones_ and noticed no effect other than a lack of sex drive.  After 5 days on Amitriptyline/Elavil_ I feel much_ much better.  Although the drug did make me drowsy at first_ after the drug took the depression away_ I have more energy than I have right now in years.  I feel alive again_ when I was felt hopeless just a few weeks prior.  If you don't respond to SSRI's_ I highly recommend giving this medication a shot.  You may have to drink more water or chew some gum_ but it's worth it.  Even at 125MG a day_ living in Chicago_ the cost?  Only $14 a month to live again.,M,27,40  days,2/12/2006Email,Elavil

So far I would recommend a low dose of elavil for people who have fibromyalgia. I have been diagnosed for this because I have constant pain all over.  Now that I have read these other ratings that say to take it earlier_ I will do that starting tonight.

I felt confusion_ shakiness_ slight tremors and felt out of it because of my body  was feeling weird and jittery,I think you should be very carefull when going up on mg.

I have fibromyalgia and always woke up stiff. Elavil helped me sleep (along with valerian)_ and I woke up without pain. Over the past two months_ though_ its effectiveness wore off (my shoulder blades are stiff and sore as I write this)_ and the constipation has been horrible_ and the blurred vision has become a major problem. I would give anything for it to work without those two problems! I just got a sample of Cymbalta to try_ and am hoping it works.

467, 5, depression and fibromyalgia,Dry mouth and some lightheadedness on standing. Side effects went away after several weeks.,I am writing because I have read many comments on here about people adjusting the dose on their own_ or worse still_ stopping cold turkey. This is VERY DANGEROUS with any antidepressant. You must increase the dose gradually and reduce it gradually. Please remember that all antidepressants affect the neurotransmitters in your brain. You need to be monitored. That said_ the tricyclics like elavil are the gold standard for me. I do not respond to the SSRI's such as paxil. If you have depression that has not responded to an SSRI_ you might need a drug such as elavil that also boosts the level of norepinepherine_ which the SSRI's do not help with at all. Do not give up. There are many options out there.Another comment: people are mentioning dosages as low as 5mg-for this drug_ 25 mg is standard for fibromyalgia and 75 mg is standard as a starting dose for depression. Allowable doses run as high as 300 mg under close supervision. I was on 150 mg for years but need only 75 mg now. I s,F,55,15  years,12/18/2005,Elavil

It was prescribed by my analyst as a treatment for chronic insomnia which I have had since childhood.  I take my dose around 7:30 -  8p... by 10p-- boom boom out go the lights! -- To my recollection_ I had NEVER experienced sleepiness.  I am up to 150 mg per day.  That sounds huge compared to other posts I have read!  I had to gradually increase from 75mg.  Cotton mouth is one side effect: doesn't bother me.  If I have caffeine in my system (coffee_ soda_ tea_ chocolate) I get the jitters.  The most omnipresent side effect is a severely reduced sex drive.  To be honest_ that has been a good thing.

It seems to help me not feel so yucky in the a.m.  I am glad that you guys all shared_ because now I do not feel like I'm crazy.  I had floaters too floating eye spots.  I feel like I have to explain that I suffered a traumatic death before I started taking the drug_ Now the grief is much better and it is time to say goodbye to elevil.  it makes me feel lazy too like I don't want to do anything but look at the unfolded laundry.

It stays in your system pretty well over time.  I didn't know this was a pain med !  I just use it for its drowsiness effect_ and it does bring on a nice_ deeper sleep.  They say it's not habit-forming_ but I'm sure you'll develop tolerance.Just don't take that whole pill at first or you'll be sleeping all day!

503, 5, depression and anxiety,side effects were dry mouth_ constipation_ kind of a loss of energy_ sleepiness_ some loss of libido_ feeling of not being yourself,i have been treated for depression and anxiety since i was 25 years old and i am now  58 yo. i would like to recommend the following strategies which i have found to be helpful. i have tried umpteen thousand other newer medications and found them notto be as good as the tricyclics at least for me.  my researchindicates that these drugs are better on men. i think this is sobecause if u are athletic (which u must be on this med i think)_pain is a more severe factor in depression. i originally took this med in the form of triavil which is elavil + trilofon (aanti- phsycotic.  long term use of the latter raises the risk oftardive dyskenisia which is horrific and possibly irreversible.i have stopped the triavil because of this and proceed with elavil. one thing i would recommend is exercise to the point ofbeing a pro. this will allow the lowest dose and add your naturalchemicals  to improve depression. i was able to have a good sex life on this med by varying the time i took it.  dont take when u and your other want sex. try to work around this and i had no compaints. sometimes i would go off it for a while because sometimes i didnt feel like myself. try to become more self awareso that u dont go too far. my whole life revolves around my mental condition_ but it is worth it as i have come to discovera sense of priority in that no job_ partner_ or anything else isworth sacrificing your happiness. in other words_ do what's necessary to stay out of a deep depression as long as its notself destructive.,M,58,28  years,10/30/2004Email,Elavil

514, 3, Pain in hip & leg_ mostly at night,I started out taking 25 mg at bedtime_ with some success with pain management_ and didn't realize I was having any side effects_ other than having hard time waking up in morning.  I had dose increased a few years ago_ because pain was coming back_ and increasing the Elavil to 50mg seemed to help.   I have had chronic diahrea and gas (have had several tests showing no other conditions)_ severe weight gain_ and I always crave sweets.  Also I've had problems with ringing in my ears and dizziness (have ruled out Meneire's disease & all other possibilities thru many expensive tests. My Dr contributed it to my high blood pressure).  I have also had problems with nightmares and 'waking dreams'.  I didn't see all the possible side effects listed for this drug until just recently_ and realized that all these other problems I have been having could be related to this medicine!  I have stopped taking it this week_ since it doesn't seem to be helping my pain problem at night anymore.  Since I have stopped taking the Elavil I am having trouble staying asleep all night now_ but pain is not any worse than it was when I was on the Elavil!  It is too soon to tell if I will see any weight loss.  I can't tell if sweet cravings have diminished yet_ but possibly.  I have noticed that I don't have as much trouble with diahrea now.  And now I actually wake up before my alarm clock goes off!  I seem to be able to get through the day ok_ even though I am having trouble staying asleep all night.  I'm frustrated that my doctor did not realize that all the symptoms I had been telling him about could have been related to this medicine!  And I will let him know what I have discovered.,A history of depression runs in my family_ but that is not why my doctor prescribed this medicine.  It is suppose to some how block pain sensors (or something like that).  It seemed to work for quite a while_ especially after the dose was increased_ but after several years of use_ it didn't seem to help much at all.,F,48,7  years,7/17/2004,Elavil

Also_ takes 2 hours to take effect_ so if you forget to take it until 11 at night you're gonna be up until 1 AM.  I recently dropped Amitriptylene (Elavil) for Clonazepam.  Clonazepam knocks me out cold in 30 minutes_ but I would wake up at 4 AM severely depressed (but definitely NOT groggy).  Added Wellbutrin to the mix and now feel really good.
