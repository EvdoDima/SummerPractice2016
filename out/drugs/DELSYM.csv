0, 1, Cough_ congestion,My blood pressure and tachycardia went so high my doctor almost hospitalized me.  The symptoms were terrifying_ much like COPD especially when flying cross country.   Sleep was impossible because the drug would not wear off for two days.  I am fine now but the is a dangerous over the counter drug that is not the good old safe tussin.,Please_ FDA_ Take this dangerous drug off the market or better yet tell me which law firm is taking these cases.,M,63,5  dayscapful 2X D,1/27/2016Email,Delsym
1, 1, I had  cough,it don't work,,M,26,5  times10,4/12/2015,Delsym
2, 1, haven't taken it,Your commercial is okay until the mother smiling hands to her child the medicine in a box. What kind of mother gives her child medicine in a box. That is called negligence.,Please have the part of the commercial removed or have the lady to portray a good mother by giving her child medicine on a spoon.,F,64,1  days00,12/9/2014,Delsym
3, 4, cough that had gone on for 2 weeks,none; son liked the grape flavor_ helped him sleep without coughing.Doctor recommended it.,,M,6,2  days,11/1/2012,Delsym
4, 4, cough_ possibly Whooping Cough,Positive effect:  Unexpected relief from neuropathic pain! Undesirable effect:  Histamine-type skin itching reaction all over and migrating_ which was helped by taking an oral antihistamine (Tagamet off label use - Benadryl leaves me too hung over the next day).  I worry about side effects I've read about on Erowid (great site also) of depression and cognitive issues_ and building tolerance.  Luckily it's working for me at low doses and I won't go beyond that if it stops being effective as I'm not interested in recreational doses.,Dextromethorphan in various cough syrups was the only thing that seemed to help my 8 week cough after a cold_ which might have been Whooping Cough.  Nebulizers and an albuterol inhaler made it worse.  DXM also helped a great deal with peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain that I suffer from long-term chronic infection_ which was a surprise.  Apparently DXM_ like Guaifenesen_ can act as an analgesic for some.  I have slept better on it than in years.  On Delsym I'm able to take only 5mg_ or half of an adult dose and get relief from the cough_ pain_ and insomnia for the whole night and it tastes like candy. So far I feel better the next day as well_ and not hung over like with other pain or sleep meds.  Maybe it will be a new tool in achieving a better quality of life by alleviating certain types of pain and insomnia.  Hopefully side effects and building tolerance won't interfere.,F,39,4  days,12/29/2009,Delsym
5, 2, bronchial cough,Light-headedness and insomnia.,For me_ it wasn't worth the price. Moderately effective_ but wouldn't let me sleep and caused light-headedness.,F,60,14  days,1/6/2007,Delsym
