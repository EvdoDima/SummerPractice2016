0, 1, very bad head cold with post nasal,My pharmacist had reccomended that I try Desloratadine(Rexall) brand to help my 13 yr old with her post nasal drip causing her throat to hurt alot due to bad head cold. It was the first time I have given her such a drug. She took 1 pill5mg within a few hrs she would get really dizzy when she stood up and made mention that her heart rate was fast. I will never give her this drug again I am prayin it doesnt get worse because this drug lasts 24 hrs.,,F,13, 5mg 1X D,5/28/2014,Clarinex
1, 3, All Year Allergies,Hyperactivity_ impulsiveness.,My son has been on some type of allergy medicine since 6 months of age.  He was prescribed the Clarinex due to claritin no longer worked.  The medicine itself does work.  Just a little background_ my son has always been very high energy.  I just assumed it was his personality and it was normal for little boys.  However_ this year when he started school it was brought to my attention that he was over the top.  I removed red dye from his diet and cut back on the sugar he was eating.  That helped some but he still had issues with hyperactivity and impulsiveness.  I was starting to think ADHD and ADD.  Then_ just for the heck of it_ I started researching side affects of Clarinex and surprisingly found links to hyperactivity in children.  Especially boys.  As an experiment_ I removed him from all allergy medicines. (including his nasal spray Flonase which also causes hyperactivity) Double whammy.  After about a week_ there was improvement.  After 2 weeks_ I was having people comment on his behavior change.  Now_ after a month off he is no longer having issues at school.  I am giving this medicine a 3 because it does work.  However_ due to the effects for my son_ he can't take it and do well in school at the same time.  I just wanted to put this out there so other parents can observe their children if they are on this and other medicines like it.,M,6,2  years2.5 mg 1X D,3/15/2014Email,Clarinex
2, 2, allergies,fasciculations (quivering) of posterior neck muscles_ and irregular heartbeat,Clarinex is fantastic for hay fever_ asthma_ and hives; better than any antihistamine I have ever taken. I never had to take it 2 days in a row because the effects last at least 48hrs. In seasons when I had to take it fairly often_ I began to wake up because of quivering posterior neck muscles and heart palpitations. I finally went to my GP_ who did an EKG which was normal; but of course the palpitations weren't happening at the time.Recently I had not taken it in 6 weeks_ then had to take it once because of a food allergy. That night_ for the first time in 6 wks the muscle fasciculations and heart palpitations happened again. I was amazed to read here that someone had had exactly the same thing happen! I am on a beta-blocker_ amlodipine_ and a diurectic for high blood pressure. I will certainly take Clarinex again if I need it badly_ but I'm a little reluctant now. I will update this entry in the future if my conclusions here seem wrong.,F,63,18  months5 mg 1X AN,3/11/2012Email,Clarinex
3, 5, Seasonal allergies,None,Worked for my son's seasonal allergies - Claritin did nothing_ Zyrtec caused too many personality changes.,M,12,2  years5 mg 1X D,1/31/2012,Clarinex
4, 4, Allergies,Slight increase in appetite and a little tightness in my rear neck muscles_ but this didn't last long.  This antihistamine worked better for me (with less side effects) than Zyrtec (which caused asthma) or Allegra.,Clarinex is my favorite antihistamine and is non-drowsy.  I prefer it over any other_ although it is slower acting than something like Benadryl.  I do recommend it_ however.,M,49,6  years5 MG 1X D,10/25/2011,Clarinex
5, 2, allergies asthma,heart palpitations_ tachycardia,Have taken clarinex for several years and all of a sudden a few months ago noticed having rapid heart rate after taking it.  Don't know if something changed in the make up or what?  Was even going to check with my pharmacists to see if I had the correct pill.  Not sure why this just started.,F,45,4  years 1X D,4/24/2010,Clarinex
