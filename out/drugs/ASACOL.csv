5, 4, UC,None_ I've felt fine.,This cleared me right up after having issues for a year. Now I'm nervous because of all the bad reviews.  I never liked taking so many pills but my Dr. Always said it was like putting a bandaid on a sore.. And it didn't get absorbed into the blood so it was fine to take.

6, 3, Crohns/Colitis,"Took about 5 months for my body to adjust to the Asacol after having been on Sulfazine EC for nearly 20 years.  Since Jan. of 2015_ have passed 20 kidney stones and all appear to be directly related to the Asacol and not diet related.  After having an ""all-clear"" with both kidneys on 5/28/15_ passed two 7mm stones on 7/2/15 and 7/17/15.  They are being formed way too quick to be from any other source.",My Crohns has been moderate_ but meeting with Doctor to switch back to Sulfazine EC.  Visits to ERs to help with kidney stones is not worth it as I'm not any better on Asacol than on Sulfazine and symptons aren't bad enough for Humira.,M,52,22  months800 MG x 2 2X D,7/28/2015Email,Asacol

One day for whatever reason my doctor gave me some saline washes to use (1994) with-in one week i stopped going to the toilet_ i.e. i didn't wake up needing the loo.....it was like a mircle. Can't imagine the feeling. I'm writing this now because i've just had a flare up. I'm going to try the same thing again as I'm pretty sure that these washes cleared me up last time.

15, 1, colitis,,My name is Michael Sipusic.  I was notified by my prescription company that a RX I have been taking since 1993 is being discontinued mid April.  Reason stated is because the medicine has DBP in it.  The drug is Asacol used to treat colitis.  DBP is known to cause thyroid cancer I read.  In December 2007 I was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer after taking Asacol for 14 years.  Thyroid cancer in males is rare.  Even though the drug is discontinued...the drug manufacturer has not made any statements on their website and it looks like business as normal for them.  This drug was slated to go generic this year and I fell they are holding off on the negative news because it will impact their stock price significantly.  On top of all that...I believe this drug contributed to my thyroid cancer.Please see attached documents and information below.DBP was added to the California Proposition 65 (1986) list of suspected teratogens in November 2006. It is a suspected endocrine disruptor. It was used in some nail polishes; all major producers began eliminating this chemical from nail polishes in the Fall of 2006.DBP was permanently banned in children's toys and childcare articles_ in concentrations of 1000 ppm or greater_ under section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA).Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with the endocrine (or hormone system) in animals_ including humans.

17, 1, Ulcerative proctitis,Fatigue_ irritability_ anxiousness_ insomnia.,I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Proctitis in my teens. It went in remission when I picked up smoking. I quit 6 months ago and started taking Asocol . Doctors don't believe me_ but this medicine keeps me awake at night_ insomnia_ fatigue_ and extremely anxious. I tested my theory that it may be the Asocol_ by taking it every other day to see if I notice a different in sleep pattern or anxiousness_ and irritability. It is indeed the medicine. In between periods of not taking Asacol_ I felt fine-- and have no sleep disturbances. However_ symptoms of my UC subside greatly when using this medicine. I dislike the side effects_ but the medicine itself is every effective.,F,33,2  months500 MG 1X D,3/1/2013Email,Asacol

19, 1, ulcerative colitis,My daughter who is now 15_ was on asacol for her UC.  When she was first put on it_ it seemed to be fine.  She started to gain a large amount of weight and started to experience severe headaches.  She had a MRI thinking she had a brain tumor_ and nothing.  She decided she was done with the meds and refused to take them_ and the headaches went away.  I am not 100% it was the asacol_ but seems to be a connection.  I see that headaches have been mentioned on this site as well.  Her UC really didn't get any better either taking this medication.  She missed 35 days of school last year_ as she couldn't get out of bed due to her headaches and would sit there an cry.

22, 5, ulcerative colitis,It usually will quell a flare-up of colitis by taking 2 400 mg pills twice daily.  This time_ however_ I've had to take it three times daily_ and it seems to have gotten a handle on the UC but more slowly than norma.  I am very impressed and grateful for this drug.  The only thing I have noticed_ and I don't remember noticing this before (when on lower dose) is that I have a remarkable amount of gas.  And what is worse is that during a flare-up of UC I experience gas pains -- so a drug that causes me to have MORE gas is obviously a problem.  Also_ the drug is horrendously expensive.  I thought my insurance would cover it but the pharmacist gave my 3 months worth and said insurance wouldn't cover it_ and the bill was $1_200.00  I'm thinking of buying it online where the prices are just a tiny fraction o that. Can I do that?,,M,52,4  weeks400 MG,4/24/2012Email,Asacol

28, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,NO side effects -- except that during my third flare_ when we couldn't get the diarrhea under control using both prednisone and Asacol_ it turned out that the Asacol was actually causing the diarrhea. So now it will have to be a crap shoot - who knows whether it will be a silver bullet_ ending the diarrhea_ cramping and pain and giving me back my life_ or something that keeps me stuck at home_ unable to risk moving far from the john.,I took 4.8 G / day_ divided into either 2 or 3 doses_ my choice.During my first bout with Ulcerative Colitis_ Asacol was a miracle in a bottle - it completely stopped the endless cramping and diarrhea. I took the full dosage (12 - 400mg tabs/day) for several months_ then tapered off very slowly and maintained remission for three years. I had a flare_ went right back on Asacol and voila! nearly instant remission. Again_ tapered off after taking it for a couple of months_ but remission was short-lived.Now for the bad news:  the next flare_ the symptoms were only marginally controlled_ even though I was taking both prednisone and Asacol. I was getting desperate_ and finally_ my GI suggested that I stop the Asacol_ which apparently sometimes causes diarrhea.  To my shock_ within a day or two_ the diarrhea stopped. Unfortunately_ I have not stayed symptom-free_ and 4 months later I am still on prednisone and struggling to get control of this disease.Bottom line:  when it worked_ it was like a miracle drug. How ironic that it then began to cause the very symptoms it had been surpressing! I wish I could find something else as good.I had no other side effects. No nausea_ no hair loss_ or anything like that. So the question each time I flare will be:  does it work_ or does it make things worse? And that will be determined by trial and error.,F,55, 4.8 G 1X D,9/12/2011Email,Asacol
29, 2, Crohns,Possible cause of gout.,A lot of the common side effects of Asacol are what I had before I started taking it_ and they largely persisted. However_ a year after going on it_ in despair in a bad patch of gut problem_ I started seeing a medical herbalist and he improved matters greatly. I now have developed gout_ in the complete absence of the usual culprits such as red wine and red meat_ and have found it listed as a side effect. The herbalist switched to concentrating on the gout and the gut symptoms are much worse - which leads me to think that Asacol hasn't helped as much as the herbalist and has probably given me gout. Herbalist is back on the gut thing and I'm going to come off the Asacol. It seemed to help a bit but has apparently been outdone by natural remedies.,F,64,3  years400 3X D,8/23/2011,Asacol

Also cramps began to travel up and induce nausea every time they hit.  Makes going to work miserable.  Can't eat until I get home.,I tried to understand how Asacol works and wonder if it is just too non-specific after I understood that it is designed to interfere with the production of a natural lipid based secretion called prostaglandins_ some of which cause inflammation but some of which also inhibit inflammation.  Here is a website that explains a little of that: http://www.raysahelian.com/prostaglandin.html  Thanks everyone for the heads up about the kidney failure and hair loss.

32, 2, Ulcerative Colitis,minor headaches/cramps/feverishness/nausea for a month (at most_ more like a couple weeks_ but spread out over a month),The first couple weeks I had a bit of the headache/feverish thing come and go sporadically but it wasn't too big of a deal in relative terms. Nausea passed after a week or so too and it was never bad enough to even make me go to the bathroom to try to throw up so it was reasonable_ I think. The only problem is the Asacol never did give me even a day or two of remission. In fact_ I went untreated for 10 years and just dealt with the annoyance of frequent_ liquid (but very quick) stools. Since I had a colonoscopy I've had a new kind of pain (12 months now_ non stop) like there's rocks or something shart in my anus. I was prescribed Asacol after the colonoscopy but things have never gotten any better_ they just changed a bit. I go to the bathroom less often_ but the cutting feeling when I go can be excrutiating! Even after a BM I can't walk or sit normally for hours without constantly adjusting my position like it's OCD. In public it's really hard to deal with. The pills are huge too_ so if I had to take any more than 4 a day I don't know how I'd carry them around and keep them private. Furthermore_ after a month or two of taking it regularly_ the capsules start coming out in your stool. My dr. said it's a good thing_ so long as the shells are empty because then you know that the medication is being released near the end of your GI system. Problem is I'm getting the feeling that broken shells that can survive a GI track probably do a number on sensitive tissue with the jagged ed,M,25,18  months1600 2X D,5/8/2011Email,Asacol

34, 2, collagenous colitis,diarrhea and gas,I was diagnosed with collagenous colitis 4 1/2 month ago. Six weeks ago I was put on Asacol after I called my doctor in desperation due to a weekend of non-stop liquid diarrhea...several mishaps where I did not get to the bathroom in time and I actually lost 4 pound in two days.  I was also put on a prednisone regime at the same time.  I seemed to improve for a few days and then things got bad again (although not as bad).  I recently noticed that one of the side effects of Asacol is diarrhea and gas.  I asked the doctor if the Asacol might be contributing to the problem.  He suggested that I stop taking it for awhile_ which I did three days ago.  This has been the best three days in four 1/2 months.  My stool is almost back to normal_ visiting the bathroom just twice in the morning_ and I feel well for the first time.  I am hoping that this turn around lasts.  I am on the prednisone for three more weeks.  We'll see...,F,66,6  weeks400 mg 6X D,4/11/2011Email,Asacol

My Dr. stated I was lactose intolerant.  Finally after 8 months I called and indicated I needed some relief. I had a colonoscopy and it was determined I had cologinous colitus.  I was put on Entecort for three months and added Asacol the last month.  I have had several flair ups since but went almost one year without any.

After seeing an all natural chiropractor and nutritionist who educated me on the effects of medicine in general I started to do some researching.

I also started to have tenderness where my liver is.  That was the final symptom.  I can live with my toes and fingers not being clear (normal).

However I had a colonoscopy 8 weeks ago which found the cause of my bleeding which was ulcers in my colon.  I had been bleeding with stool for about 5 weeks which is what prompted me to get checked. There were a couple of areas where there were colitis or swelling.  My doctor believe's that it's Crohn's.  I took the enema treatments at that time and all of my symptoms went away... temporarily.  I went for my follow up appointment with the GI doctor last Thursdayand I was free of symptoms.  By saturday_ I was down_ again_ sleeping all weekend_ and bleeding again.  I also found out that I'm 6 weeks pregnant.  The risk of having the colitis while being pregnant are worse than taking medication according to my doctor.

His comment was that Asacol can play havoc with the bone marrow...didn't say that on the tin!,My dosage was 2 x 400mg three times a day. I am not sure if any improvement was attributable to the drug_ or that I was between flare-ups. I was wary of taking this drug as I am already allergic to Aspirin_ so I was surprised that the reaction took so long to occur. The Doctor was confident that this method of administration modified release would probably mean the usual reaction would not occur and it didn't. The symptoms when they did occur were characterised by a fairly rapid onset and very intense_ feeling completely floored is not an exageration_ for three days I spent much of the time asleep.

Doctors don't quite know what to think_ because the white count looks like leukemia_ but other cell don't exactly match. If you are considering Asacol_ run for your life! Try other things first.

163, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,Extreme Hair Loss_ fatigue and joint pain,I feel a lot better with the exception of the side effects. Especially the hair loss!  I do exercise daily but did before. I watch my diet moderately. I've been diagnosed since Feb.2006. I stopped taking the drug about 6 months after the first flare and did not have another for over 2 years. Not sure if I will do that again though as the flare this July was much worse. Hope to find hair loss relief!!,F,38,3  months,11/5/2008,Asacol
164, 1, UC,I don't trust Big Phaarma drugs. To be safe_ I took only 1 tablet the day I bought them_ and within 20 minutes_ my whole body went haywire. Just ONE ASACOL TABLET gave me an extreme allergic reaction that kept me ill for days!! I told my G.I. doctor I was allergic to sulfa drugs_ and he promised me that  Asacol was safe. Bullsh-t! THIS IS A POISON_ PEOPLE_ not a drug.,I took the single Asacol tablet_ and w/in 20 mins I had a migraine headache_ itchy throat_ runny nose_ blurry vision_ then I started coughing and sneezing non-stop. From JUST ONE TABLET! The next day_ I woke up with a blotchy rash all over my arms_ legs and torso_ AND I had flu-like symptoms. From JUST ONE TABLET! The following (3rd) day_ I had acne breaking out on my face and boobs_ a bigger rash_ gas_ and breathing problems. From JUST ONE TABLET! And my doctor wants me to take 3 tabs 3X a day?

170, 5, diagnosed with UC in Oct 08,none,I was dignosed with a mild case of UC in October of 08. I started with 9 pills (3pills/3X day)and gradually symptoms went away. After about 6 months of no flare ups. My doc slowly weaned me gradually to my current 4 pills per/day. I've been trying to wean off alltogether because drug is not recommended if you are pregnant and we're trying to have baby.  Everytime I drop below 4 pills I start getting flare ups literally within 1-2 weeks. That's my only concern. I have no problem staying on Asacol because I've had no side effects_ just pregnancy issue. And I agree with some of the other posts- many side effects described are actually symptoms of the disease. Joint pain is one of my major symptoms. But it is because of your immune systems inflamation response. For any immune related disease eating properly_ excersising and taking a heavy vitamin regiment including probiotics helps tremendously.,F,38,10  months,10/25/2008,Asacol

The flare-ups are less harsh and less frequent (but I've also only been on it a little while). Possible hair loss_ but I've always ""shed"" a lot (extremely thick hair) so I can't tell the difference. Frequent urination is annoying_ but much better than dealing with the colitis pain.

Some of my symptoms were relieved but other were not. After a year of feeling miserable on the ASACOL_ I started the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (while still on the meds) eliminating all processed sugars and artificial sweetners and grains. Within weeks I felt better and food never tasted so good!!! It takes committment (you have to cook) and is no quick cure but last week I had my first colonoscopy in almost five years and my gastroenterologist was amazed at how clean and healthy my colon looked. I've been weaning myself off of the meds for months and feeling great. My last two blood work results were astounding. White count perfect_ sugar good_ cholesterol good.

So you need to find a good doctor_ not one who just puts you on high doses of drugs regardless of side effects.,F,19,9  months,6/2/2008,Asacol

My GI did a colonoscopy (with biopsy) and I was immediately diagnosed. He put me on Asacol (6 pills/day) and Prednisolene (40 mg for 2 weeks then tapered off within next month). I am still on Asacol.

214, 4, Lymphocytic Colitis,Diagnosed with Lymphocytic colitis following colonoscopy in February_ 2008_ which followed 3 months of horrible diarrhea and a weight loss of some 20+ pounds.  Colitis was caused by another drug (took exhaustive research & getting 3 doctors to talk to one another to figure THAT one out).  Anyway_ the Asacol worked so-so until I stopped the other drug_ and then it worked like it was supposed to.

217, 2, IBS with questionable colitis,I started Asacol in 6/2004_ by 9/2004 metabolism slowed down_ weight gain_ edema_ body temperature dropped and began to get chills and was freezing ALL OF THE TIME.  By 10/2004_ had pneumonia for a month.  Went off Asacol_ but metabolism never improved.  While many lose weight_ I can only theorize that because I had an existing underactive thyroid_ Asacol interfered with my existing endocrine dysfunction including suppression of my adrenals (akin to steroid use).  My thyroid meds hardly work anymore even with increase.  Perhaps there is an underlying condition in some who have gained as well.  You can have a thyroid problem that is subclinical and tests show normalcy or its borderline so the physicican does not want to treat it.  I fought to find one who did (says over 60% of the population has it and never knows). In the end_ I found that Asacol did nothing to improve the left sided pain.,Here is what I found improved me:  Got off sugar_ wheat and yeasty foods (candida).  Added Stonyfield Farms organic fat free plain yogurt (its the only one with 6 different live cultures for the stomach).  Don't eat sugary yogurt_ it defeats the purpose.  I added splenda and a diced apple in it.  I have one for breakfast daily (within a month it improved digestion).  I continue this regimen daily and have had a major improvement in symptoms.,F,37,5  months,5/4/2008,Asacol

UC Came back last year ( due to stress I think ) started Sulphalazine again but not so good this time were hard to take - massive tablets_ discoloured urine - terrible heartburn ( not supposed to take indegestion remedies with them and trying not to drink milk - lol !)_ also had continual flare ups with them.  Asacol seems better so far no flare ups - easier to take - no real side affects so far.  Also previously tried Aloe Vera gel capsules and probiotic vitimans which I think helped.

229, 1, UC,My first symptom before going to the doctor was only blood in stool. After taking asacol it went to full blown UC_ pain_ more blood_ excessive bowel movements. After 1 month on it_ I developed Pancreatitis.,It seemed that after taking asacol my symptoms got a lot worse. Everything was heightened-pain_ bowel movements_ blood. I began to notice pain in my upper abdominals and was told after 1 week that i should go to the ER. I ended up having Pancreatitis. Was treated for 1 week for that in the hospital and was feeling better. Then the doctors started to focus on my colitis again and put me back on asacol. 2 days later I woke up with severe pain in my pancreas again and they found another stone (which was gone before the asacol was given to me 2 days prior). I was taken off Asacol and placed on another anti-inflammatory and prednisone_ my pancreas is fine now. Other side-effects from all the drugs are blurred vision_ dizzyness_ fatigue_ memory loss.One more thing... I have been off Prednisone for 3 months and Asacol for 5 months and I'm having excessive hair loss. It is all very disheartening. You expect the drugs to fix a problem not cause so many others.

I was going to the bathroom 10 - 12 times a day with excessive bloody stool.  I also took Predinsone first then Lialda four times a day for about a year. Neither worked for me. This caused excessive hair loss_ stomach pain_ and fatigue. The Asacol has not caused that at all.  My hair is growing back.  I'm 10 times better now.  Only using the bathroom twice a day at regular times.  The only worry is my kidneys.  My doctor checks me every three months to make sure the kidneys are working fine.

237, 4, Crohn's,weight gain_ change in hair texture_ mild acne. (noticeable change since I started Asacol.),I had symptoms of Crohn's for 6 months before diagnosis & treatment.  Hip pain was my biggest complaint.  I had occasional constipation and then one day got an abscess which eventually turned into a fistula. I did not have any noticeable intestinal discomfort until I was given Cipromax (antibiotic). Then I had persistent lower left quadrant pain. At that point a colonoscopy showed inflammation at the end of my small intestines. I started Asacol right away.  Hip pain went away and has not returned! I have not gotten any more abscesses or fistulas. I still have occasional intestinal discomfort_ always lower left. I have noticed corn_ corn meal & corn flour start a flare up for me. If I avoid those_ drink 64 oz. of water_ take my vitamins/supplements (B 12_ E_ DHA_ probiotics) and the asacol_ I feel great. I take 3 pills 3x day when lower left pain is present and 2 pills 3x day when I feel fine. Stress is definitely a factor in my flare ups too.

I have also taken the drug with no problems through two pregnancies although Asacol is listed as a category B drug. Because the drug is delayed released in the colon_ my doctors (GI and OB) felt it was safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Which is a good thing because I flared up slightly with each pregnancy and would have ended up in the hospital without Asacol. I'm still loosing hair but some of that may be post-partum.

269, 3, Crohn's Disease,None that I am aware of.,Initially prescribed Prednisone_ Asacol_ and 6-MP all at once. Prednisone made me feel 100% better but the doctors worried about long term effects and tapered me off. The 6-MP seemed to be making me sick_ esp. after the doctor increased the dosage. I wound up in the hospital for a few days with mild pancreatitis which I believe was caused by the 6-MP. Once off of all medications but Asacol (and over the counter drugs such as Immodium and Digestive Advantage Crohn's) I felt good and was later diagnosed as being in full remission. Recently_ I forgot to refill my prescription in time and ran out of drugs. It was a holiday weekend and I couldn't get my script filled until several days later. It seemed as though my condition remained unchanged while taking no Asacol whatsoever (just the Immodium and Digestive Advantage). I've stayed off of it just to see what will happen.

I was told it had progressed to Crohns about 5 yrs ago. I was taking flagal but I was still getting sick. I was put on Asacol about 10 months ago. I am suppose to take 6 tablets a day 400mg...I took it straight for 4 months and I changed the dosage myself to 4 tablets a day. Then I stopped taking up all together just to see if I would have any flare up's. Sure enough I had a flare up about a month ago. It was bad. Normally I can tell when I am about to get sick because it starts with a fistula. Then I am sick for about 4 to 5 months straight. Then I recover and do not experience any sickness for several years. When I stopped with the asacol I had a flare up for about 2 days. So I started taking asacol again but this time only 1 dose a day. Only because I am afraid of the side effects. Because there isn't a cure I have no choice but to take it. My GI DR. told  me if the asacol doesn't help I would have to switch to Remicade.,F,34,10  months,6/12/2007,Asacol

I did not have a flare up for 10 years and lived a very normal life for the most part.  Really needed to monitor and adjust diet and followed ""Bland Diet"" for a few years after first being diagnosed_ which was a little difficult but worth it for feeling much better.  The long-term effects of this medicine are also not well understood and I emplore everyone taking it for extended periods of time to get regular colonoscopies (every 2-3 years) and have kidney function checked regularly (every 1-2 years).  This is important since doctors are hesitant about taking anyone off of asacol and since it is often taken for extended periods of time (10-20 years).",M,25,11  years,2/13/2007Email,Asacol

326, 3, Ulcerative Colitis,I seemed to get better at first_ then I couldn't tell if I was experiencing side effects from the Asacol or if it was just my colitis.  Some joint pain_ severe headaches.,I went on Asacol and Entocort about a year ago.  I was on Entocort for a few months.  Not sure if the improvements were from the Entocort or Asacol.  Entocort was great though_ no nasty side effects like with Prednisone.  Anyways_ I stayed on the Asacol for a year_ and about a week ago I decided that it just wasn't enough.  I was still going to the bathroom anywhere from 5 to 10 times a day.  So I stopped taking it to see if I felt any better.  It's been a week and I actually feel better now without it.  I am closely  monitoring my health and if I feel like I am getting worse_ I'll contact my doctor.  But_ I don't want to get back on Asacol.  Years ago I just took Asulfadine and that helped.

327, 1, Mild Colitis,KIDNEY FAILURE!!!!,When I was diagnosed with a mild case of colitis four years ago_ I was put on Asacol.  My doctor told me this drug had the least side effects_ that it was like taking an Aspirin.  My colitis was gone after a couple of weeks.  I had no side effects_ and I thanked God for this drug!  After four years I was told I was cured_ and was taken off Asacol.  Four months ago my colitis returned.  I went back on Asacol_ and I started experiencing all the side effects from it_ and my colitis was not getting better.  When I went for blood work they told me to see a Kidney Specialist because my Creatinine level was slightly elevated.  After I saw the Kidney Specialist and_ going thru an extensive amount of tests_ I was diagnosed with Kidney Disease.  My Kidneys are functioning between 20-29% and next year I am expected to go into Kidney Failure.  IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE ASACOL PLEASE GET YOUR KIDNEYS CHECKED even if you have no symptoms.

330, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,It's nice to hear that other people are experiencing the same symptoms as I am! I recently had my dose increased_ and have noticed a significant amount of hair loss. I also occasionally develope leg cramps_ but otherwise_ it has greatly improved my quality of life!,I started developing symptoms when I was 5 months pregnant with our second child. Our family doctor repeately told me it was just hemmoriods_ and not to worry about it. The bleeding and mucous in my stool was so great_ I had no energy_ and literally thought I was going to die. After a year_ of not being checked_ and told I still had hemmeriods_ I decided enough was enough. I got a second opionion. The doctor was horrified by my symptoms_ and sent me for an emergency colonoscopy.... the results indicated I had ulcerative colitis. I find the Asacol has really improved my quality of life_ but at times I still have flare ups. Including intense cramping_ and mucous and bleeding. I am continually exhausted_ but I believe that is a result of the colitis_ not from the Asacol itself. It is a disease I would not wish upon my worst enemy_ and I hope one day.... there may be a cure to stop the suffering.,F,26,1  years,4/29/2006Email,Asacol

338, 3, Crohn's Disease,Since being on this medication I started experiencing hair loss_ easy bruising_ fatigue_ insomnia_ and headaches.,I was put on Asacol after a hospital stay for extreme anemia and GI bleeding. I had blood transfusions_ blood work_ etc. No scope was done (I still can't figure out why). They constantly tested my stool and urine and I wasn't released until there was no signs of blood in either one. I haven't had any signs of blood in my stool since my release but my blood pressure has been dropping every week_ my hair is now falling out in clumps and I have bruises that for the life of me I can't figure out where they are coming from. I don't know if this is because of the Asacol but I can't see any other explanation. I know people get those ghost bruises where they don't know how they got them but when you have 13 on one leg_ 8 on the other 5 on your arms and even on your rib cage there is something really wrong there!

339, 1, Ulcerative Colitis & Crohns,I had severe chest pain that radiated under my arms.  It was never 100% diagnosed_ but my GI doctor never wants me to take Asacol again.  He said that in rare circumstances Asacol could cause Pericarditis or Miocarditis.  This is a very dangerous heart condition that can cause death.  When I experienced this reaction_ I took my prednisone early thinking I was having a reaction to the prednisone.  This probably decreased the inflammation in my heart_ which possibly saved my life.  My cardiac enzymes were elevated_ and the doctors originally thought I had a heart attack.  The angiogram showed that I did not have enough blockage in my arteries for a heart attack to occur.  The doctor stated that you usually would have at least an 85% blockage of your arteries.,I hear and know of more and more people taking Asacol who have had severe and deadly side effects_ such as kidney failure.  This person who had kidney failure now is on dialysis and will be getting a kidney transplant from a family member.  My condition was not reported and I know that the person with kidney failure was not reported.  I have known of someone whose liver started to fail_ but thankfully revived before total failure occurred.  I believe Asacol can be a very very deadly drug.  I was on large doses at the time of my condition (16 tabs a day).  I was origanally diagnosed with UC 20 years ago_ but in the later years have also been diagnosed with Crohns disease.  During this time I have had ups and downs with flair-ups.  During my times of remission I do not take any medications.  I try and eat a healthy diet free from sugar and preservative foods.

I will continue with the Asacol as maintenance.  For those it doesn't affect adversely_ keep taking it as studies show that it can greatly decrease the chances of getting colon cancer.

Resumed taking medication and knee bursitis started along with resumption of high fever. During hospital stay_ diarrhea worsened and dosage of Asacol was increased. Fever subsided_ but I left hospital with painful knee bursitis. Started taking medication for bursitis_ but  since it caused nausea_ I stopped taking Asacol. My knees got better and I resumed taking Asacol after being off it for one month. Started taking Asacol again and high fever returned along with more diarrhea_ loss of appetite_ and severe dehydration. Entered hospital and was taken off all medication while being treated for symptoms of kidney failure. After rehydration via IV solutions for three days_ I was discharged from hospital. No long taking Asacol and I am completely free of knee pain_ fever_ and have regained lost weight and normal strength. Colitis has been remedied by Entocort.,If you take this drug_ be sure to have your kidney function monitored very closely. The drug has the potential to ruin your kidneys.,M,69,2  months,2/6/2005,Asacol
381, 4, Crohn's,Initially small headaches_ though they have faded.  Flatulence (though could be the crohn's).,Only been taking it a month_ but tenderness and soreness in abdomen is gone.  Still get pain if I don't watch what I eat.,F,40,30  days,2/3/2005,Asacol
382, 5, ulcerative colitis,none,Asacol put my first UC flare-up into remission four years ago.  At the time_ I was taking 3 pills_ 3 times/day (3.6g).  I was fine for two years_ then had another flare-up.  I had to increase the dosage_ and take prednisone_ to get it under control.  I'm now taking 4 pills_ 4 times/day (6.4g)_ which is over the recommended dosage_ but my doctor recommended it.  Although I did have a flare-up while taking Asacol_ I think it has helped a lot.  I've tried multiple times to cut back to 4.8g/day_ but can't do it - if I miss a dose_ I notice a huge difference - cramps_ diarrhea_ etc.  In four years_ I haven't noticed any side effects.  My only complaint is that it's so expensive!,F,20,4  years,12/28/2004,Asacol
383, 3, Crohn's,Tired_ joint and back pain.,I guess I just don't feel that it's doing much for me.  I'm not in the pain I was in before being diagnosed with the disease but at that point it was so bad I barely had a functioning intestinal tract.  This is the first meds I've taken since being diagnosed and just unsure if this is what living with the disease is like or if it truly doesn't work.  Scares me to try something else and have that not work too.  Then what..?,F,27,6  days,12/20/2004Email,Asacol

387, 2, UC and rest of intestines ulcerated,extremely tired and weak,Stopped taking asacol a week ago_ was on it for a year. Wasnt really working for me_ I was just taking it because the doctor prescribed it. was making me weak and tired. I feel like a million bucks now_ only one week later_ as if I never had UC. combination treatment of diet_ digestive enzymes_ and probiotics + AMP mole-cure (molocure.com). The last year of my life has been a mission to beat this problem I had. I am confident to share with you that the nightmare I had been learning to live with is over. Also read 'Healing Inflammatory Bowel Disease' by Paul Nison. Molo-cure is awesome_ it is an extract of the polysaccharide of the Aloe plant_ taken on an empty stomach in the morning. I have turned up the intensity of all my treatments because of the severity of my problem. I take a boat load of probiotics_ about 5 times the recommended dose of plant based digestive enzymes(I figured out really quickly with the enzymes that a root cause of my intestinal problems was there is something majorly wrong with my body digesting my food_ which also caused all types of food allergies_ which only made the colitis worse)_ also my diet is mostly watery fruits like cantaloupe and watermelon my favorites ( I read a couple of books on digestion and they told about how to eat foods that are considered easily-digestible_ and how not to mix types of foods like protein and carbos because it makes it had for your body to digest_ don't drink liquids with foods in your stomach because it dilutes the digestive juices_ and don't over eat because your body is having trouble with coming up with enough digestive juices to digest the regular size amounts of food anyways. And also molo-cure_ awesome stuff_ it is a pharmaceutical grade supplement_ I am taking about 3 times the recommended dose_ no side effects (BEAUTIFUL)_ all natural. Cost is 175 dollars a bottle of 270 pills_ in a week I worked my way up to 15 pills every morning. This stuff blows away asacol_ I wish doctors knew about this stuff and werent so hot to prescribe some crazy drug that is so expensive_ wasn't doing that much for me(saw my money floating in the toilet)_ and had lots of side-effects_ not to mention the long-term side effects I don't want to know about. I'm looking forward to gaining some weight back_ this all has taken so much out of me_ I am so skinny.  I wish someone had been able to tell me the things it has taken me a year to learn_ but if anyone wants to know more or chat_ i am happy to_ my email is wheatgrassman@hotmail.com. Good luck to you_ fellow Inflammatory Bowel Disease fighters. Daniel is signing off!,M,28,1  years,11/24/2004Email,Asacol

389, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Perhaps mild weight gain,After I was diagnosed with UC_ my doctor put me on Asacol. It really helped me_ until I quit my job and couldn't afford the pills. I was off Asacol for about 4 months until I got health care coverage again.  Being off the pills resulted in numerous flare ups_ the worst I've ever experienced.  My doctor upped my dosage to 4800 mg when I'm not feeling so well.  When I feel okay_ I usually only take about 1600 mg/day.  I think it has really helped to keep me in remission.,F,27,2.5  years,9/12/2004,Asacol

391, 3, Ulc. Colitis / Possible Chrones,I havent noticed any major side effects. I do feel fatigued and have headaches often_ but this is mostly becuase of the colitis_ so I've heard.,I have had Ulcerative Colitis since I was 15. I was put in the hospital for a week and immediately put on 9 pills a day (3_400 mg). The medicine itsself does not control the disease; I also have to take varying forms of steroids_ and 6mp (a medication used also on leukemia patients_ to reduce white blood cells)_ which will hopefully replace the use of steroids.,F,17,2  years,8/28/2004,Asacol
392, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Mild flatulance and I believe it has caused some sorness in my throat,Within days my colitis symptoms disappeared.

395, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,Stomach pain_ fatigue/loss of energy_ occasional diarrhea/constipation_ weight gain.,Originally I was on predinose (I had severe leg cramps_ and thought my stomach aches were due to the drugs)_ and finally found a specialist who was able to properly diagnose me.  On asacol_ the leg pain is gone (used to be so bad I could barely walk).  Generally_ I'm very pleased_ though it is frustrating to have so little energy_ to be wary of going out (don't want to use a public bathroom in case of emergency!)_ and to stress out about getting stressed out :)  But all in all_ I'm doing much better now than I was nine months ago_ when I first got sick.,F,24,6  months,7/16/2004Email,Asacol
396, 2, ulcerative colitis,At first severe cramping_ diarhea and throbbing headaches.  These subsided but were followed up by significant hair loss and acne as well as sudden_ frequent needs to urinate.,After diagnosis I was put on prednisone to reduce my flare up and then on asacol for maintenance.  I believe that the effectiveness varies from person to person but I don't believe it worked for me. I recently went off asacol and am beginning a new drug.,F,28,3  months,7/13/2004Email,Asacol
397, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Perhaps weight gain. I do suffer from some joint pain_ but that developed (apparently with the colitis) before using this drug. I cannot really report any significant side effect.,Asacol solved my chronic diarrhea almost immediately. I experienced immediate and total recovery_ after many months of chronic diarrhea. It was prescribed by my doctor after a colonscopy procedure.,M,59,8  months,6/10/2004,Asacol
398, 3, Crohn's Disease,I know this sounds weird but it causes severe numbness and tingling in my fingertips!  It is worse in higher doses (3 pills/3 times a day; total 9 daily.),It's okay.  I stay in remission most of the time_ but I worry about the numbness.  I ruled out all my other meds. I cut my own dose down to 6 pills a day and the side effects decreased somewhat with no apparent change in Crohn's symptoms.  Azulfidine_ which I was on before_ caused only mild numbness in my fingers.,F,49,3  years,6/2/2004Email,Asacol
399, 4, ulcerative colitis,hair loss first two rounds with the asacol. although did keep my disease in check. I dropped my dose myself and the symtoms came back. Not wanting any more weight gain_ I have refused the prednisone this time arround. So the doctor has put me on the max dose of 12 per day.it has been 2 weeks on 12 and no hair loss as of yet!  **Marie; I recieved your E-mail but accidently deleted it before I got a chance to read it re: hair loss? PLease re-write.,Wanted to share with everyone. I have been researching how to counteract what these meds do to our system. I now take herbs and vitamins to help with my hair and weight Kelp is good for the hair growth. ginsing is good for the adreanals that is what the prednisone has effected. Cayanne garlic and ginger great for the intestines.I also am now crushing B complex vit. before I take them as to get. max absorb,F,40,9  months,5/26/2004Email,Asacol
400, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Maybe a bit of fatigue,This drug made my life livable again.  I went 10 yrs. before i was finally dx with UC_ and was immediately put on Asacol.  It had an immediate effect_ and all but cured my diarrhea.  It is a bit expensive_ and so when i switched jobs i couldnt afford and went off it and all the symptoms returned.  i started back on it and it has been wonderful.  I dont know if the people at the bottom of this comment board should have been taking htis drug in the first place_ but for those of us who had bleeding beforehand and uncontrolled disease for so long_ it may be a godsend. Its worth a shot_ of course under close supervision.,F,23,8  months,5/22/2004Email,Asacol
401, 3, Crohn's Disease,No noticeable side-effects.,I first started taking this drug after I had colon surgery where two pieces of my colon was removed immediately after I was diagnosed with the disease. I still occasionally get minor pains in the abdomen at the site of the colon connections and have ben back to the Hospital 3 times within the last 2.5 years_ so it's very hard to tell whether this medicine is working or not. Unlike most Crohn's patients_ however I suffer from chronic constipation. So Really I'm not sure what to make of this medicine at all.,M,30,2.5  years,5/7/2004Email,Asacol
402, 4, ulcerative colitis,im pretty sure all the side effects i expereienced were from the prednisone. but now that im off that medication i still experience headaches_ cramping_ exhaustion_ stiffness .. and depression. but that could just be the disease. oh and frequent passing of unbroken pills. so i dont even know how many actually get the chance to work,its better than steroids. and its only like 3% of ALL patinents that it effects badly. like those two bitching women at the bottom. i was in the hospital from my birthday till christmas. and im not complaining. i had worse symptoms then both of them put together. try not being able to graduate_ walk. have to eat trhough a tube in your heart for 2 months.,F,17,7  months,5/2/2004Email,Asacol
403, 3, Colitis,Bloating_ gas_ more frequent trips to the bathroom_ fatique,At first the bleeding got worse_ then I began taking 2 tablets 4X a day and the bleeding stopped.  But around midterms_ it came back_ I think_ due to the stress.  My docter seems to think that it is all physical and more drugs are the only answer.  I think stress management would also help.  For the past month or so_ it doesn't seem like the meds do much other than make me feel bloated.  I'm glad to know that I am not alone!,F,20,5  days,4/22/2004,Asacol
404, 1, Chron's,Tired_ headache_ abdominal pain_ bleeding_ not hungry_ it just makes me feel bad it takes all my enegry away and that makes it hard for me to go to school full-time and work full-time espically when i don't feel good,I don't think that it is a good drug i don't like it and i hope to change with in the next few months,F,18,3  months,4/7/2004,Asacol
405, 4, ulcerative colitis,hairloss was extreme at first 3600 mg. per day. my Dr. dropped dose to 2400 mg. day I am only faithful to 800 mg. lately and noticed hair loss to be decreasing .,this med did not work for me in the beginning. I was eventually persribed prednisone for a few months together my U.C. was under control then weened off the steroid. Asacol is sufficient now.I still have the discomfort I think it is from me playing with my dose. and not being faithful with my med. in fear of my hair loss.,F,40,7  months,3/2/2004Email,Asacol
406, 5, Crohn's,I have been taking this drug for 6 years and did not have any side effects until I increased my dosage to 8 pills a day.  At that time_ I began to lose significant amounts of hair.

408, 4, Crohn's Colitis,Joint and back pain which could be caused by disease; headache,I have taken Asacol at various dosages_ currently at 6 per day.  Well tolerated.  It seems to keep the disease quieter_ but not in total remission.  Caplets do not always break down_ hence_ my money goes down the toilet.  Lowered dosage to 4 per day recently and had more problems.  Went back to 6.,F,44,8  years,11/30/2003,Asacol
409, 3, crohns,none,This medication had only a small effect in holding flares down when taking only Asacol. Took it along with prednisone_ and was found to be intolerant of the prednisone. Currently taking 2400MG daily along with 50MG of Purinethol and have been flair free for 6 months. I wonder if I would be doing just as well without the Asacol.,M,43,1.5  years,10/22/2003Email,Asacol

411, 3, Ulcerative Colitis,I think it is hard to say which came first_ the colitis or the bloody diarrhea. I have U.C. for about 1 year now_ and have been on various doses of asacol for about that long. Frankly I was shocked to find out that a side effect is bloody diarreha. I am now taking 1600 mg (4 pills) 3 times a day. I also take Prednisone (10 to 60 mg) every day.,I feel tired most of the time and have very little energy. I still have lots of pain_ diarrhea_ blood_ urgency_ & 9 - 14 potty trots a day_ most of them at night. Needless to say I am not a happy guy. As/If things change I will update this comment.,M,67,1  years,9/12/2003Email,Asacol
412, 1, colitis,Started taking this awful drug with onset of localized colitis.  After only a few months_ it caused EXTENSIVE and SEVERE ulcerative colitis throughout my entire colon. I had severe anemia due to massive bleeding_ severe pancreatitis and was hospitalized for 6 weeks.  Had 40-50 bowel movements per day with black tarry diarhea_ severe bleeding and chronic intense abdominal pain. Was told I needed to have my entire colon removed because of the damage caused by this horrible drug. Almost died from massive bleeding and severe pancreatitis.
