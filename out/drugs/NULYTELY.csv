0, 3, Colonoscopy Prep,WHY does it taste SALTY?  And it is somehow a thick or slimy sensation going down.  I have zero gag reflex issues and I never vomit but this stuff gagged me and made me wretch.  Half of this concoction may be realistic_ but the entire JUG? My gut bloated and burgled and it made me belch long before it started clearing me out.   And what is this FLAVOR PACKET others mentioned? My jug said lemon lime on it. I got no flavor packet or choice of flavor. I tried putting Apple flavor mio drops in it. That's the only way I have gotten 2/3 down. It's 1 a.m and I doubt I will get any sleep tonight.,Someone PLEASE come up with something that isn't salty!!,F,50,1  daysHuge Jug,5/17/2016,Nulytely

I Was told to drink 8oz every 10 min....I did 8oz every 15 or so to try and ward off possible nausea.  Got very bloated feeling until it ""kicked in"" (about an hour and a half in).  I opted to go on a low residue diet for 3 days before prep so I became cleared out pretty quick...only my first bathroom trip had solid matter.  Worst part of it for me is still having the rest to finish and the shivering like I'm cold.  To anyone who is facing this prep keep a positive attitude and don't stress too much!

6, 1, colonoscopy prep,Absolutley Horrible! The taste is disgusting and iit is so nauseating.  The only reason doctors use this vile chemical is because in the case of Medicare_ that is what they approve. Guess why?  It is all about MOney! The insurance companies dictate what meds we can and cannot have_ not the doctors...Drank this most horrific solutions_ cleaned out_ lost 6 pounds in less than 24 hours_ vomited_ had a migraine headache and a full blown Meniere's attack.  My gut was completely robbed of all good flora. I have been taking pharmaceutical probiotics for a month and my gut  and stomach still feel as though they are being eaten from the inside..  I have had 7 i.vs trying to replace the fluids I lost. Tuesday will be exactly 4 weeks and I am still very ill.  I did call the company but all they wanted to know was what color is the label?  they didn't seem concerned at all. Adding that I am 74_ female and weigh 110-112.

8, 4, Colonoscopy,Bloating_ distended belly,"I felt the need to review because I read so many reviews that scared me beforehand that I was ridiculously nervous. I'm an anxious person who hates all things medical and I've suffered from chronic and painful diarrhea and intestinal spasms_ hence this colonoscopy. I hope I can assure someone else via my review NOT to get nervous and worked up over this prep. If it's true that this is the worst part_ I am a happy camper. (procedure tomorrow). I mixed my solution with Glacier Cherry Frost Gatorade per the pharmacist. (note that even though it's ""cherry_"" it's white.) The taste was FINE!! No_ I don't love it. But it did not make me gag or vomit or any such thing. It get's sickening 12-13 glasses in_ but so would anything and chasing each glass with some cold ice water and lemon was enough help to get through it. It took me about 2 hours for it to produce movement. I felt bloated and a bit uncomfortable_ but no big deal. The diarrhea was not at all crampy or painful like my normal problems. It's very mildly uncomfortable due to the bloating. The worst part was honestly having to stay up all night! Mine was split into two shifts_ 2 liters at 8:30 pm and 2 liters at 2:30 a.m. but due to the spacing and the diarrhea it basically meant no sleep at all. In the end hopefully that helps with my anxiety actually going in to the procedure. I'm tired! I hope my review helps someone else relax over this stuff.",F,37, 4 liters 2X D,1/30/2015Email,Nulytely
9, 5, Colonoscopy,Ok guys I'm the biggest wimp on the planet. I'm post chemo for stage 3C colon cancer_ I also have Crohn's disease & a bunch of other things wrong with me & a TON of allergies. This is my first colonoscopy post chemo. Here's the secret_ the CHERRY flavor packet. I hate all the other flavored (lemon-lime_ orange_ pineapple). I have to do it slower than norm because of my issues. Cold_ cold_ cold. Then put it in a measuring cup_ hold your breath_ drink thru a straw (I'm doing 4oz every 15 mins). I can get 4 oz down in 3 drinks_ the chase with cold Mt. Dew. So far so good. I'm 1.4 liters into it but have only gone twice. I've got a headache & I'm cold but it's also cold outside. This is NO WHERE near as horrible as I thought it was going to be. Esp the taste_ I've had to take worse. The after taste reminds me of a cherry zinc lozenge. Kinda gross but not unbearable. I honestly thought I'd be miserable & going nothing but water by now. So we'll see. If it gets unbearable I'll post again. But I'm used to going a lot more than this with having the whole right side of my large intestines gone & the Crohn's.,,F,44,1  days,1/15/2015,Nulytely

I measured out 8-10 ounces every 15 min_ and drank it down I was cleaned out in less than two hours. I drank 4/5th's of the solution...I could have drank it all_ but no reason too.. I read all of the horror stories from people on the site.......really people_ suck it up_ it wasn't that bad!

And I also held my breath and drank it_ as someone suggested on this website.  I started drinking this at 04:30pm and finished it by 11:55pm.

13, 4, colonoscopy,"Overall the medicine has been working so far. However_ I think that for someone my size 4 liters is a bit extreme I am 6-8 glasses in and already have liquid stool with no particles. The hardest part is getting ""used"" to the taste. One thing that I've found that helps me is chewing mint gum before and after drinking it. Drinking through a straw helps. And I've learned that if you focus on your breathing it is almost impossible to gag. Best of luck to everyone going through this and remember it's only one day you have to take it.

The flavor packets add nothing from what I could tell and the liquid is more viscus than regular water_ and slightly salty. This was not a pleasurable experience_ but now it's over and it worked.

I did a ""split prep"" meaning I drank half (about 8 8-oz cups) in the evening and then 8 hours later I drank the rest.  My first cup was unflavored and awful_ after that I added flavor crystals from what they gave me which helped enormously.  I pretended I was on ""Survivor"" to help me drink each cup fairly quickly.  Don't laugh_ my little mind game helped :-)    I liked the split prep for two reasons...I was so glad to get to stop drinking halfway...would hate to have had to keep drinking more_ and two_ my prep was rated ""excellent""...this stuff worked.  Five years ago I took laxative pills for my first scope...in comparison_ taking pills was much easier than drinking all this liquid_ but they made for more prolonged_ unpleasant bowel movements.

I'm just over 1/2 way done and I've only had 2 small bowel movements - worried I won't be cleared by morning (It's been 2 hours since I started).

19, 3, Colonoscopy,Bloating and severe nausea after 5th glass.,I wish they could come up with something different. I was doing fine till after the 5th glass when I became bloated_ nauseaous and started throwing up in my throat with any movement. It took about 2 hours for it to finally start working its way through so I could drink more. Its sad to have to use 2 vacation days for such misery.  I used the lemon lime flavor on recommendation from the pharmacist.  I only got 3/4ths through the nulytely and couldnt stomach anymore but I was fully cleaned out. I do recommend_ vaseline before your bum gets raw_ cottonelle wipes and adult diapers for when you are so tired and need to go to bed. My prep was worse I think because I have Fibromyalgia and the pain pills were going straight through so I was hurting badly. When I got there and they started my IV they gave me some IV Benadryl that made me feel very dizzy_ pressure in my chest and I couldnt talk or walk right. I dont see anyone else complaining of that experience. Once I got to the room they gave me another medicine in my IV that put me right to sleep and I didnt know a thing till they said I was done. Now that it is over I have no idea how I got dressed. lol  I have a friend in another state who had to take Miralax mixed with Gatorade instead of the Nulytely and she said it wasnt bad. Despite the misery I would do it again as it could save your life.

23, 5, colonoscopy prep,No side effects.,I was expecting this colon prep product to be disgusting. I wouldn't want to drink it everyday but it wasn't as vile as it had been made out to be. I opened all the flavor packets_ smelled them and decided to use the orange. Not sure how much if any the flavor packet aided in my ability to drink this product. I used a cylinder measuring glass and a straw. Was able to down the required dosage in 2 1/2 hours with no problems. The next morning I had to drink a  10 oz. bottle of magnesium citrate. Now that was gross. Both had the desired effect of cleaning out my colon. Survived the colonoscopy_ a polyp was found and removed.

24, 4, Colonoscopy,I read all the comments before I started. Best ideas: use crystal light lemon aid to help the taste ( I also added some of the liquid flavor drops to give it more flavor) . Keep liquid very cold and use straw. Keep baby wipes and Vaseline by toilet. I had to do the split prep so mine lasted over 14 hours. Just when I had stopped going from the first batch_ I started drinking the second batch. Worse part was waiting for the urges to stop. I was clear for hours but would still have to run when the twinge hit. Am hoping they improve this process in 10 years when I do this next.

25, 4, Colonoscopy,Nulytely will make you feel somewhat bloated until you begin to eliminate then no problem. It will also dehydrate you.,Number one suggestion is to mix Nulytely with either orange or lemon flavored drink mix to improve the taste. Also using a straw to get it past your taste buds helps. Finally drinking something immediately afterwards_ my choice white grape juice will kill any taste left in your mouth. Overall it was not the worst thing I have had to drink. Masking the flavor is key.,M,52, 4000ml 1X D,4/29/2013,Nulytely
26, 4, Colonoscopy Prep and Endoscopy,"Nausea and ""emptying out""",I found that the best approach for me to drink the whole gallon was to mix the prep without flavoring and then in the bottom of an 8 oz cup I sprinkled a little bit of Crystal Light Lemonade.  I put some Vicks under my nose to prevent smelling the solution and then drank the 8 ounces and chased it with a few sips of Mt. Dew followed by sucking on a lollipop.  I also gave myself 20-25 minutes between each glass to prevent vomiting.  I hope this helps someone.,F,30,  1X D,10/25/2012,Nulytely

On the evening before my procedure_ I had to drink eight-8 oz glasses (with 10 minutes between glasses). Then I had to repeat the same procedure at 3:00 the next morning. 16 glasses in all and felt like I was going to vomit several time. I chased each drink with Sprite and that seemed to help.

The day before the procedure_ before the nulytely_ had to drink a 10oz bottle of magnesium citrate - it tasted like drinking grape sweet tarts which is not so bad_ but having nothing but fluids since start of day - I wanted to eat not drink.  I started the nulytely at 5pm_ I only wanted to do small doses at a time_ so I drank 3oz with 1/8 teaspoon of lemon crystal lite every 7 minutes with a straw- I set the timer on the microwave.  I was able to down it in 15 seconds.  It didn't taste bad at all.  I followed alot of the suggestion on this webside about the prep h pads and just in general about being prepared.  At 9:10 I called it quits I just can't consume all this liquid that they want you to consume.  I left a little less then 1/2 the jug_ but on the instructions they wanted you to finish the entire container - which I did not do.  I mean even something I really like and can't drink that much of_ and they give the same size jug to a 6'1"" man as they do a 5'3"" women - How do they figure that!!??   The next day I was worried that perhaps I should have drunk more_ but the fluid came out clear yellow - yellow I figured because of the crystal lite.

I also used a straw based upon another patient's comments. I found the straw super useful. I still had to taste the stuff (which seemed to taste worse the more I drank) but the straw put it closer to my throat so I didn't have to taste as much. The taste makes it hard to drink and I'm sure this would be true with any flavor but I think some flavor would better than no flavor. I found that after 3 glasses I immediately threw up because it was too much for my stomach. When I switched to smaller glasses this was no longer an issue. Don't get me wrong_ the product works like it's supposed to but there is nothing pleasant about it. My procedure was two weeks ago and every once in a while out of nowhere I will get that taste in my mouth and it is gross. If I have to do it again I will see if I can take a pill instead.

Mixed/chilled prep a few hours before drinking it. Did not add any flavoring to prep. Made a ""checklist"" broken into 15 minute intervals and checked it off after each cup I drank.The taste of the prep is not bad. Slightly salty_ but I was expecting sea water. The consistency is somewhat gelatinous_ but not unpleasant. Did not have to use toilet until I was close to the end of the first 64 oz. Next morning I had to finish another 64 oz. I took the jug out of the refridgerator and kept it out as it had gotten very cold. I also poured the 8 oz drink into a cup 15 minutes before drinking so it would warm up a little bit.  The trips to the bathroom were frequent but not constant or so urgent that I found myself running to the toilet.

42, 4, Colonoscopy Prep,Gagging_ Nausea_ Vomiting,The taste was absolutely terrible. I threw some of it up and barely got 1/3 of the entire dosage down. I used a straw and I chased with cold water and flavored cold water. On the plus side_ I ate very little for two days before the prep. I started drinking it at 5:30 PM on prep day. I got results in just under 30 minutes and had clear_ watery stools in under 2 hours. I kept trying to drink more since I had not been able to get much down. I was worried that even with the clear stools I might not have gotten enough down to be completely clean. Thankfully_ I needn't have worried. The doc said my prep was excellent...I didn't tell him how much (really...how little) of the stuff I was able to drink. I asked about using pills next time and was told that they usually only give the pills to patients that request it.....really? If I'd known about the pills when I made the appt. I would've requested the pills! I am grateful that the colonoscopy showed I didn't have any serious problems. Good luck to everyone with their preps and procedures in the future!

A little bloating.,Really could use some taste improvement but as long as it was around 38 degrees it wasn't too bad. Took almost 2-1/2 hours to start taking effect_ causing a little bloating_ but once it was working there were only 3 hours of occasional urgency feelings. Was clear at this point so went to bed and only got up twice during the night. Seems to have done what it was designed to do with only minor and acceptable side effects. Don't sweat it!

I read these posts a few days prior to starting to take this medicine and I tell you what...they had me all nerved up. I was dreading it all day. I got home and started to get my glasses all measured out and lined up since I didn't know what to expect. If it was going to make me a sick as everyone was saying_ I wanted to be all organized with my doses measured out. I took a sip and it had ZERO flavor. Nothing. I couldn't even taste the 'salty' flavor some talked about. I actually was able to add a bit of beef broth to it_ heat it_ and drink it like no big deal. Long story short-Don't over think it.

47, 3, Colonoscopy Prep,Extreme bloating and failure to eliminate for the frist three hours.  Very uncomfortable,I have done a prep in the past but it was with pills and liquids.  This did not start taking effect for three hours and it became almost impossible to put any more in my distented stomach. At that point I lengthened the time between glasses.  It took me 4 hours to drink the gallon. When I finally did start eliminating_ i never really felt any cramps or urges_ just started to run out.  It would have been better if I had known that this effects people in many differnet ways.  All the instructions say you will start eliminating after  one hour_ or three glasses_ so when three hours pass and you feel like you are going to burst_ you wonder if this is normal.  I did not find the taste as bad as having to take so much liquid in such a short span.  I believe if you start eliminating sooner you don't get the uncomfortable bloat.

48, 4, prep for colonoscopy,Some nausea and urge to vomit,"I was prescribed Nulytely colon prep for colonoscopy; told to drink 1/2 of the solution late afternoon before and the rest early next morning.  If I'd known how disagreeable the taste really is_ I would have asked if there is an alternative_ as I have a strong gag reflex and and had to hold back vomiting several times.  It's the sickly sweet taste on top of the slightly salty that got me.  Overall_ it's not that horrible_ because I was able to get it all down (if I can_ almost anyone can!).   Here's what helped:  lime wedges to taste just before_ during and after drinking the mixture (don't swallow any seeds or pulp); it went better when I switched from filling mini water bottles with the solution to 16 oz disposable cups with an ice cube (even though all instructions say ""no ice"").. the coldness helped me; banana popsicles to suck on when I felt the nausea come on-- the strong taste of the banana helped counteract it; and a straw is imperative!  If I had to do this again_ I'd try adding some Crystal Lite_ even though I was told not to. This prep seems much worse than previous ones_ hopefully better alternatives are on the horizon.

49, 5, Colonoscopy Prep,Explosive bowel movements,I read through these comments the night before my own prep (today) and I want to assure everyone --- this is NOT that bad. It really_ really isn't and I'm a huge baby about stuff like this. First of all - my biggest suggestion - a 16 oz plastic cup_ a straw_ ice and Flavor Splash Aquafina (Grape) worked just fine. The next tip: Do NOT let yourself taste the stuff. I never did. I held my nose each times and while you can tell the taste is salty and sweet at the same time_ you will not gag. I mixed mine with Lemonade Crystal Lite and the lemon lime packet they give you and chilled it for a day. It really_ really is not that bad. I would suck down two sips_ then take a sip of the Aquafina. All I ended up tasting was grape. My first BM started approximaely 1/2 hour after I first started and after about 20 oz. Keep in mind --- these aren't continual bowel movements (which is what I thought they'd be). They're more like spurts of liquid which come out every 5-10 minutes or so_ so you're not chained to the toilet like you'd believe. I used Balmex and Charmin Wet Wipes from the beginning. I got through 4/5 of the container_ but stopped because since about 1:30 (I stopped at 7pm)_ my BM's were clear and bright neon yellow. It's now 9:19 pm and I'm pretty much finished. Just hungry.

50, 3, Colonoscopy prep,intestinal growling_ over full feeling_ extended bowel movements well past when stool was clear_ then followed by evacuating much gas when fluid was finally evacuated out.,"Did what it was supposed to (along with the 3 Bisacodyl tablets at the start):   it cleared the colon for colonscopy_ which ended up giving me good news: no polyps.  That's the good news.  And while not pleasant to drink_ it was tolerable.  Five years ago I used Fleet Phospho-Soda for the prep_ and I didn't feel nearly this bad.  I am told the Fleet option is no longer used because of potential kidney side-effects_ but the nurse told me today that if I remember to say five years from now how unpleasant Nulytely had been_ there still may be some other alternatives. Basic problem with Nulytely was that I was evacuating clear stools for 5 hours after the last cup_ even though various literature had said expect 1 to 2 hours_ maybe 4.  Then_ after the 5 hours_ I still had the urge to evacuate_ almost all night_ but there was nothing left but gas.  And out it came_ again and again.  Meantime I had unpleasant intestinal feelings and sounds.  Part of the difficulty may have been that under instructions from my doctor_ I took all 4 liters_ just piling down the liquid to evacuate_ even though the watery stool was totally clear by about 3 liters.  I have read elsewhere that if that is the case you can stop there_ but my doctor's clerical person crossed out that language and said ""finish entire gallon.""  So I did.  And it just kept coming out and coming out_ and left me feeling very poor.

The first few were fine_ but then my gag reflex kicked in and my body just did not want to swallow this stuff anymore.  I made it through the whole prep though but came close to vomiting many times.  I used the orange flavor packet which added a lovely orange SMELL to the liquid but zero orange flavor.

At first it's fine_ barely tastes like anything. Around the 4th dose I started to have difficulty_ it just tastes like thick salt water and the mental aversion starts kicking in. I started to suck on limes before and after chugs_ which was ok. It took me about 4 hours until it started working_ and up until then I was feeling really bloated and gassy and upset it hadn't worked yet. Once it did though_ phew... what a relief_ I was so happy. Also at that point I started mixing with lemonade Crystal Lite... holy god_ I was upset that I didn't do this early. SERIOUSLY_ IT MAKES IT TASTE LIKE NORMAL LEMONADE. At that point I was chugging the hell out of 16 oz portions with no problem_ and my stool has already been mostly liquid at that point.

There is always going to be some discomfort taking any kind of colon prep. As for the taste_ there is not much we can do for that. Its a sodium based solution and will taste nasty no matter what. We tell our patients to drink the solution with a straw so the taste will go straight to the back of your throat.,There is a pill form called Osmoprep that can be takin with cation. It is made of sodium phosphate and if not used with large amounts of water will damage your kidneys. we recommend drink an eight ounce glass of water with each pill. The best prep that just came out is called Suprep. It consistes of only two sixteen ounce glasses followed by 2 glasses of water each.

I was very apprehensive about the NuLytely but I found it much easier to ingest than the Phospho-soda (which made me gag repeatedly) and I was completely clean for the test. I did take suggestions from this page about keeping the liquid cold_ biting into a lemon or lime before and after each dose or a quick sip of Sprite_ all of which were helpful in my case.

I kept trying to pound the glasses to meet the ""drink an 8 oz glass every 15 minutes"" direction and it didn't end up working for me after the 7th glass.

Just drinking the total amount is a bit overwhelming_ can illicit a gag reflex by the third liter.,Best advice I received on this blog was to use fresh lime wedges to suck on before and after drinking the solution. Also if you eat light the day before your fasting day it makes it easier on you intestinal tract. During my fasting day I found chicken broth_ tea with lemon and nonalcoholic beer to really help. Especially the beer since it was a clear liquid and got rid of the feelings of hunger. By midday I had a headache due to lack of caffeine_ a cup of tea got rid of it in 5 minutes. Drank the Nulytely  over a 3 hour period and finished almost all in the am_ my exam wasn't scheduled until noon.  BM ran clear by 9am.  So best advice is buy no alcohol beer for the day before and use fresh limes to down the Nulytely with a water chaser.

81, 4, pre surgery clean out,A little mild cramping_ became a bit weak but as soon as I drank water and gingerale I was better,I previously used Movi-Prep which is only 2 liters total and it tasted like flat alka seltzer_ nothing adverse at all. Trying to glug down a gallon of your favorite drink at 1 cup every 10 minutes is hard_ let alone some non absorbable liquid chemical crap. I mixed lemon lime Crystal Light Pure Fitness powder in each cup_ held my nose and drank it down. No where near as bad as I thought it would be_ its just the volume of liquid that's brutal. I had to space it out much longer after about 7 cups. There is no way in hell I am going to be able to finish this gallon. I'm a little over half way and when I walk to the kitchen to think about another cup the gags come on just thinking about it.

82, 5, colonoscopy prep,Mild bloating and chills,Started stressing about the prep 3 days before I had to do it. Got a lot of good tips from other comments.  Didn't each much the day before and day of prep.  Be sure to get baby wipes & vasoline. Used Crystal Light for flavoring.  Really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Dr. prescribed 4 Docolex at 2:00 pm and a quart of water between then and 5:45 pm when I took an anti-nausea pill. Started drinking the potion at 6:00 pm - had to drink 2 litres that night and the rest at 4:00 am.  The first 3 glasses went down pretty easy.  Then they went down slower & slower.  Took me 2 1/2 hours to get the 2 litres down. Was feeling a bit bloated but kept standing/walking to get it moving.  Also took a sip of 7up after each glass to help with bloat. First bm shortly after 3rd glass and it relieved some of the bloating.  The bm's kept coming but by 10:30 pm I fell asleep until the alarm went off at 3:45 am.  Drank another litre and everything came out clear so I stopped.  My last bm was at 6:30 am. Had the colonoscopy at 8:30.  That was a breeze!  Home by 9:45. Everything ok...good for 7-10 years.

83, 3, barium enema prep,bloating_ overall fatigue,this stuff is not fun to drink_ in my case i didnt have a lot in my bowels from the day before so i didnt need to drink the entire gallon before i was having the completely watery bm's. the stuff tastes really salty and i gagged a few times trying to chug it down. the flavor packets dont help much but im sure they are better than not using them at all. it definetly did what it was supposed to do though in turning your bowel movements to a pale yellow liquid. overall i would have to say that drinking this stuff for an entire day was the worst moment of my life so far. i know it says to drink 8oz every 20 minutes but honestly if you start to feel too full_ just wait until you feel somewhat better to drink more because it will make you gag trying to down more of this stuff. good luck to anyone who has been prescribed this stuff_ not a fun experiance.,M,21,1  days1 gallon 1X D,8/31/2010,Nulytely

85, 3, Colonoscopy,Did not flush me out completely.  Did not start going until after my 3 hours of drinking were done.  Kept going following morning and after procedure.  Some chills_ no nausea or vomiting.  Colonoscopy was worse!,So I took the generic_ Gavilyte_ which has the same active ingredients.  The Doc told me to mix it up in the am on the day before my procedure.  I was to drink the entire gallon (i think it was a gallon) from 5-8pm. Honestly_ I did not think it had a weird smell or texture.  I mixed each 8oz does with either 1/2 packet crystal light or with chicken broth.  The taste was fine.  Straws help.  I started gagging a little bit into the 2nd hour_ but I think if you drink a massive amount of anything you will gag.  I finished about 8/10 of the bottle_ as I just couldn't suck it all down in the time allotted.  I had mild cramping and some chills_ but no nausea or vomiting.  I didn't start going until 8pm_ when I finished the med.  From there it went from 8 to about 11:30 when I went to bed.  In the morning it continued_ even at the surgery center.  I never felt like I got completely clean though.  When I woke up from the procedure_ they said they had to flush me out since I did not get rid of all the matter.  I was in a lot of pain from them pumping in air and taking biopsies.  Literally I was in tears all the way home_ until I got in my bed and let go of some gas.

87, 4, to prepare for a colonoscopy,none,I am so glad I read this; my experience was not bad at all thanks to all the help. It didn't taste bad at all because I followed this advice: refrigerate the mixture at least 5 hours before you begin taking it_ put wet glasses in the freezer to use when serving yourself this med_ cut up lime wedges and bite it before and after each dose_ hold your nose when drinking the solution. I did use the orange flavor pack that came with it_ but honestly_ it didn't taste like anything when I used this approach. Thanks for the advice. Oh! get the vaseline and soft wet cottonelle wipes for comfort. And_ when you are on a clear liquid diet_ i recommend drinking kellogg's pink lemonade protein water. it gives you 5 grams of protein with each drink which i think helped me feel better during the fast. good luck!,F,31,1  days8 oz 8X D,8/11/2010Email,Nulytely
88, 4, colonoscopy prep,very rapid onset of diarrhea_ bloating,OMG_ given the choice between this stuff & torture_ it's kind of a toss-up. That being said_ this is my 3rd prep_ but I wish I had found this website earlier.  The tip about adding Crystal Light lemonade packets has been a MAJOR help in getting the Nulytely down without gagging. I'm drinking it over ice_ with a straw_ every 20 minutes...it's rough_ but the lemonade flavoring is SO much better than the disgusting flavor packets that come with the prescription. Somehow_ it's`helping to mask the awful oily texture too.  I will give a warning that everyone already knows_ but bears repeating...stay CLOSE to the potty (or you may not make it).  Just trust me on this.  Another trick that's helped me get the Nulytely down the hatch a little more easily is doing a little project as I drink it.  I've been folding laundry (one piece_ one chug) and other silly stuff to make me focus less on the unpleasantness at hand.

89, 4, colonoscopy,None,I am so glad I came to this site before my colonoscopy (July 7). My previous one was seven years ago and it was so difficult to swallow the Nulytely. So my tricks were to suck on a lime wedge before each glass. I drank the stuff standing up_ through a straw in a cup with a lid. I put a clothespin on my nose to avoid the smell completely. After I downed each glass I ate a peppermint lifesaver.  Within two hours the trips to the bathroom started and I was clear about 90 minutes after that. I was supposed to take the split dose method but didn't need to drink the other half. I did drink one half of the Nulyltely and by the last glass I was beginning to gag a little_ but that was the only problem I had. No cramps at all. Just parked on the throne with a good book and crossword puzzles. The worst thing that happened was the lights went off around 10:30 for a couple of hours.  I will never dread doing this again. One small polyp was found and removed. Limes are the way to go and thanks again for those who suggested using them. One thing that may have helped: two days before I went on bland diet and the day before liquids only. So there wasn't much in my colon to begin with. I think that made a difference.,F,60, 4 liters 1X D,7/9/2010,Nulytely

With Golytely I threw up no less than 20 times_ and with Nulytely I can easily stomach it. I made my solution with light orange Gatorade G2. I used that in place of the water in the gallon jug. I then measure out 8 oz in a measuring cup_ and pour it into a smaller glass. Once I drink it (quickly_ not slowly) I bite a lemon wedge. It immediately gets rid of any saltiness. Yes_ it is salty_ but it is not bad. Golytely is thick AND salty -- this is just salty.

Could not finish 4 liters probably had 15 8oz glasses before gagging. Tastes like seawater. Was starving most of the time despite having chicken broth to dull the taste. Health pros now tell me if stomach is distended to wait a little longer to finish the stuff instead of trying to follow a 15 min wait. My colonoscopy found a bunch of benign polyps and the procedure was a breeze. It's the prep that I dread doing again in 3 years. Four liters is just too much and I was up to midnight and didn't get but 4 hours sleep for a 8am appt.

94, 2, colonoscopy prep,Gagging_ nausea_ minor vomiting_ inability to keep to prescribed schedule,"This is my second time taking it.  5 years ago I had it without flavoring_ which was tough to choke down due to gagging.  This time_ I sniffed the 4 flavor packs and chose orange_ which helped only a little.  Still the gag reflex is there_ especially when ending a drinking attempt and swallowing the last bit.  Relaxation and practice helps get 3-5 swallows down before gagging_ rather than on each gulp.  The BEST trick I found is to swish a teaspoonful of heated clear chicken broth  (I used Swanson ""Natural_ 33% less sodium"") around in your mouth before and after each attempt.  This got me 6-12 gulps per attempt before I'd feel a gag coming on_ and let me drink the stuff closer to the prescribed schedule which is otherwise physically impossible.Only threw up once_ just an ounce or two before I controlled it.Other tips are to force out burps after a major drink; and to rapidly bounce up and down (like a boxer jumping rope) for a minute if the stuff is bloating you rather than proceeding downward to do its business on schedule.

It's the same principle as swallowing a horse pill with water.,I'm amazed by the polarity of comments here.  For the people with high thresholds for punishment_ good for you.  But this was THE hardest thing I've ever had to in my life (until I had to take my own stool samples).  I drank HalfLitely.  The flavor packet I used (Citrus Berry) did not make the solution taste any better.  If I had to describe the taste of it_ it's like drinking salty baking soda water with a hint of fake fruit flavoring.  I drank it EXACTLY as prescribed (8 oz every 30 minutes for 4 hours split up in 2 sessions).  My bowel movements were surprisingly non-urgent.  I actually had to force myself to go each time.  The HalfLitely did what it was supposed to do; made my stool look like urine.

I had to do a split prep_ one at 5 pm and one at 1:30 am. I decided to put the lemon-lime flavoring in and add additional lemonade crystal light. I think that was my second mistake--it was way too sweet. After six (6-8 oz. drinks)_ it hit me hard--I had not taken a bowel movement (3 hours later) and I started vomiting violently. I honestly think I was ""filled to the gills""_ which caused me to throw up. After talking to my nurse friends_ I decided to take a long break_ even though I was less than half done. I did not find the bowel movements to be as unpleasant as drinking the prep. I only drank about three more glasses throughout night (about half of jug) and called my doc to tell them I could not finish. They did an enema before my precedure (not as bad as I thought). At 123 lbs_ I think half the jug (2 L) was adequate. There wasn't hardly anything left before the enema. Overall_ nasty liquid_ horrible experience_ and I hope I don't have to get one for a long time. They found four polyps so I'm glad I had it done. There has to be a better way to do this.

112, 5, Colonoscopy prep,Chills.,"Have been worried about the colonoscopy_ still am_ it's tomorrow.  But the prep has been rather easy so I'm optimistic that I'll get through the exam as easily as others have said they did.  I mixed the jug this morning around 10AM with the Pineapple flavoring.  Started drinking the stuff around 3PM and then every 10-15 minutes since.  Took about 3 hours for me to finally polish it off.  Took about 2 hours before it started to ""hit"" me.  Being scared of any medical procedure_ it doesn't help when they tell you that it will start taking effect in 30 minutes to one hour because just before it started at the 2 hour mark_ I was panicked_ what if it won't work on me.  So needless to say_ the worry was for naught as I was soon going like a stopwatch_ about every 10 minutes.  Just enough time to get up_ drink the next load and then head back to the bathroom.  Worst thing so far has been getting the chills.  I normally am always hot_ wear shorts around the house even when it's below zero outside_ have even taken the garbage out in my shorts when the snow is blowing_ so was surprised by the chills.  I thought I was imaging things until I read here that others have had the same ... helped calm my nerves.  Of course_ once it started then began to wonder_ when does it stop.  Sure  beats the old ways of drinking cod liver oil or enemas.  All in all_ I found it to be a piece of cake.

113, 5, Colonoscopy,Gagging after about 6 glasses; terrible gas,I was so nervous about having a colonoscopy that I didn't worry too much about drinking the drink until the time came.  After starting the drink_ my worry then changed to whether I would be able to finish it.  I had a noon appointment the following day_ which I was disappointed about having it be so late_ but for me it was a blessing since I had to drink two liters the night before the procedure and two liters the morning of the procedure.  I did okay with two liters until the end when I started to gag_ but luckily I was done then until the morning. The same thing happened to me the following morning with the gagging_ and I ended up drinking only one additional liter (three in total)_ and I was totally cleaned out.  If I had to drink the entire four liters at once_ I wouldn't have been able to do it and I would have had to cancel the appointment.  I mixed the drink with the cherry flavor and it was terrible.  There was not a lot of flavor and the smell was also terrible.  Friends have mixed it with Crystal Light_ and I think that would probably have been better.  I have given the rating a 5 only because it did a good job doing what it was supposed to do_ but there has to be a better way.  As for taste_ I would give it a rating of 1.,F,50,2  days,1/15/2010Email,Nulytely

I am sad to say that I only could finish 1.5 liters-about half.  I say half because I ended up throwing up the little more than half that I drank.  It came premixed with orange flavoring_ but I could not taste any flavor in it.  I started off drinking it down pretty fast_ but it gradually ended up subsiding to looking at the glass and trying to hold back my gag reflexes.  I almost wanted to take a match to my tongue to dull the pain I had from drinking this.  I just could not finish this thing.  I tried biting lemons..it helped somewhat.  I later saw other posts about mixing with Crystal light...I should of tried it.  I ate light the night before and had a big grand slam breakfast early morning; the day of the dreaded Nulytel.  I did not drink enough water during this day..I should of drank more; I was at work.  At around 4_ I took 4 ducolax and mixed my Nulytel. Before I started_ I had a nice big_ smooth BM. I started the chum drink around 6ish and started off well.  I seemed so bloated and full and I tried to drink more_ but I felt it was backed all the way up to my esophagus...I finshed about halfway around 9ish and decided to call it the night after throwing up from it and holding back my gag reflexes when I thought of it or stared at the full glass of it.

124, 5, colonoscopy,None,"Not the best tasting stuff in the world_ but not horrible either.  The worst part is the salty aftertaste.  My instructions were to drink  8-12 oz every half hour.  I mixed it in the morning and used the cherry flavor packet (if I'd had my glasses on_ I'd have used the yellow packet which was pineapple and not lemon).  After mixing_ I chilled it for several hours.  I took it exactly as prescribed (every 1/2 hour) and used a straw to drink it.  I found the best way was to hold my breath while swallowing - taking six or seven big sips through the straw.  When I took a breath_ I tasted mainly cherry and a slight salt after taste.  It didn't make me sick or cause cramps and bloating.  It did what it was supposed to do_ but I could control my trips to the bathroom.  I knew when I had to go_ but didn't have any real sense of urgency.  I started at 3PM and was ""clear"" by 8PM.  I think people might get nauseous if they drink it too quickly_ so I'd recommend drinking 8 oz rather than 12 oz on the half hour (if your doctor allows it).

I found that if I took sips_ chased by a diet 7UP or a sugar free popsicle_ it was tolerable. It took three hours to complete the entire 4 liter jug. That time included two successful_ but not urgent trips to the john. By trip number three_ at the end of the three hour ordeal_ you know what_ was clear. Industrial strength tp ( I used ultra strong Charmin ""heavy doody"")_ and disposable wipes are recommended. I began by putting the drink in the freezer after mixing. At three is was prescribed that I take 4 Ducolax - I took 5. And at 5PM I began drinking the concoction from the freezer_ almost like a slushy. I noticed that as the drink warmed it tasted grosser and saltier. After each sip_ I would take a sip of 7UP or alternately a bite of the lemon flavored popsicle. This worked quite well for me. It is 10:52_ I had another visit to the john at 10:30PM -again clear.

TO make a very long story short--I took the laxatives as directed also. I finally started to have some movement but not what should have been happening. At 6:30 am --an hour before I was expected to arrive at the hospital I still had not gone enough. I called th e doctor and we had to cancel the procedure.  I was out $30 which I had to pay out of pocket.,I had even taken laxatives the night before I started clear liquid diet because I take narcotics on a regular basis for chronic pain and was concerned that if I did not keep up my high fiber regime what might happen. I wish that my saga ended there! I was sick all that day but still never experienced clear liquid bowel movement. I slept all of that day and night--highly unusual for me. 3 weeks have gone by and I have not been right since! I still am not having regular bowel movements even though I have increased my fiber intake and have taken bisacodyl every day and then every other day. A week ago I had diarrhea for several hours but still not significant to clean out all that was in me! I have refused to use this prep again! But I am still concerned that my bowels are not back to normal. I never expected anything like this.

136, 3, Colonoscopy,No side effects,Taste bad_ and 4 liters seems like way to much_ but I was able to drink it down. The idea of using a lemon to cover the taste worked nicely. I drank down each 8 oz dose_ squeezed a little lemon juice on my tongue. Whoever left that idea--thanks to you. I had my colonoscopy this morning. I don't take any meds to put me sleep. This is my third time and the pain was fairly intense compared to the first two times. I think the doc pumped more air into my colon than before.For those who are interested in going this route here is some info: the first few minutes_ and the last few minutes of the procedure are the most uncomfortable. The time in between is not bad. The whole procedure usually last 15 to 25 minutes. When the pain comes I do deep breathing and know it won't last much longer. Pulps come out without pain. This time around I didn't have any pulps. The first two time I did. I focus on the TV and ask questions. The doc and nurses are happy to talk and answer questions. Usually their patience are asleep_ so they get a kick out of having someone watch the TV and talk with them during the procedure.For those who are doing it for the first time. Don't be concerned. The prep is the worst part. My brother wouldn't get a colonoscopy and as luck would have it he got got colon cancer. Beat it_ then it spread to his liver_ beat it again. He just finished chemo.

145, 5, colonoscopy,some minor cramping,Just had to check in and make my contribution_ which is to say if my experience means anything_ then take heart. I have to say up front I was only told (very explicitly in my written instructions from the doc) to drink a HALF gallon_ so I don't know what's going on with anyone who's been told to drink the whole thing... that said_ a few comments - first off_ +1 on the vaseline and moist wipes. definitely made it comfortable. Then_ here's what I did... chilled the nulytely_ ditched the flavor packs and mixed in one tub of crystal light lemonade_ cut up a lime into wedges_ and made some chicken broth. Oh yeah_ I put the glass I was using in the freezer too. Then every 15 minutes I just pretty much chugged a glass_ biting on the lime wedge before and after. Another key thing - I love playing guitar_ so I put a favorit concert on the DVD_ turned it up loud and watched and played along so I would not focus on the drink - also_ you know how when you eat when you have a cold_ you have to breath through your mouth and you can't smell/taste anything? Do that_ don't allow yourself to taste it. This allowed me to picture the drink as being cold lemonade_ and I honestly never really tasted anything else. When I started to get really full_ I went 20 minutes in between glasses and had a couple sips of chicken broth to settle things. So in short_ don't lie around waiting for this to be a bummer.

I have to do another colonoscopy in a year_ so hopefully I can find the second Holy Grail by then: a cure for the nausea that comes with dumping that much evil into the stomach in that short amount of time.

148, 4, Colonoscopy,Some bloating_ slight chills_ looong time to work.,"Okay_ I will tell you right off that I was terrified! I have IBS_ and thought I would end up with all the symptoms_ and would throw the vile stuff up.It really wasn't so bad_ after all. And I am a big baby. The stuff is nasty_ no question. With 2 flavor packs in_ cherry and lemon-lime_ I tried the straw technique_ and I think that gagged me the worst. Something about unnaturally hitting the back of your throat. Through trial and error_ I ended up doing something not posted on this board. I had bought lemon drops_ nto the lemon heads_ the real_ powdery lemon drops. I popped one in my mouth_ stuck it in the side_ grabbed a cup_ and chugged several gulps_ maybe 7 or 8_ when I stopped_ immediately moved the lemon drop into middle of mouth_ and sucked on it. It totally made this bearable! I started taking it at 2pm_ and was not able to drink it as fast as I was supposed to_ due to being ""full""_ but I got through it by 7pm. I was probably only doing a glass every 20-30 minutes.Fully expected to be hitting the bathroom by 3 or 4_ but oh_ no.... It took until 5 for the first bathroom trip_ stayed pretty solid_ up until about 8. Then I hit the watery stage. Kept up until about 11pm_ then went to sleep. But this morning at 8:45_ woke up having to go_ and am still going on and off. So beware_ this make not happen quickly!Advice...took a book into the bathroom_ when I was ""done"" for a bit_ just pulled my undies up_ and had a seat on the rug_ read my book.",F,31,1  days,6/8/2009,Nulytely
149, 5, Colonoscopy,No side effects.  I only felt a little chilled but nothing I couldn't handle.,Someone on here suggested not putting the flavors in the mix.  I sprinkled some of the 4 flavors in the glass and it was tolerable.  I think that's where it becomes slimy is with the flavorings.  The last few glasses I did without any flavorings.  I thought it tasted like an Alka Selzer or even Gatorade. One of the things that helped me was to keep busy until the next glass. I set my timer and worked on the computer; I found it helped not thinking about the taste or anything else. I also sucked on a butterscotch hard candy; it helped take the taste out of my mouth. Another hint I have is to buy some of the very softest toliet paper or buy baby or adult wipes.  That really helped.  I had read the opinions here prior to my treatment and was crazy by the time I started my treatments.  I didn't find the whole experience to be as bad as some are making it out to be.  My doctor also prescribed a couple of pills for vomiting but I didn't even take them.  Actually this treatment is better than what I took before. I didn't have any cramping whatsoever.  This procedure and the colonoscopy itself was a piece of cake if you just follow the instructions.,F,63,2  days,6/6/2009,Nulytely

I am switching doctors and will go with a different regimen.","If you tend to gag easily_ don't take this stuff. Believe me_ I tried to tough it out.

Then suck on a small lemon wedge-this gets rid of the taste in your mouth immediately. I wish I had'nt spent yrs worrying about all this. Was not nearly as bad as rumored. Don't listen to everyone else. My husband is doing the same liquids today and tomorrow is his colonoscopy-first one for both of us! I have found men downplay the side affects of the nulytely if any and women over-exagerate it! Alot of the people in this forum I feel were young adults that whined too much about nothing.

People at my house can sit there and tell me to hurry up and drink another glass.. I wanted to throw them through a wall. There is no way someone can drink 8oz every 10 mins until its gone; THATS IMPOSSIBLE. When i finally had a bowel movement I pooped for like 30 minutes straight. I was on a clear liquid diet so it was hardly any stools. I feel bad for my toilet. I agree with the people that said the doctors should drink this once a year.

I finished the last drop at 6:30 pm. This is where the ""different strokes"" comes in.From what I read here I expected my reaction to the fluid to be anywhere from nausea to projectile vomiting.This drink is neither pleasant but more importantly_ not unpleasant.

Maybe it will make you feel virtuous but...  It does not matter what you ate  it's coming out.  Every last bit.  And then you will shoot neon-yellow water for several HOURS after the last fleck of solid matter is a dim and distant memory.  All well and good_ the good Doctor needs to see clearly.  That being said_ there is no excuse for this vile preparation.  My friends in the UK take some pills_ and then drink lots of water.  Same wonderful effect.  So why are we here in the U.S. comdemned to drinking quarts of urinal cleaner?  Some type of Klingon rite of passage?  Puritanism?  Self-flagellation?  And if that's not bad enough_ find their web-site where they gush (heh) about how their wonderful product comes in ""3 great-tasting flavors"" and is ""well-tolerated"".  Yeah_ right.  Mussolini was well-tolerated.  Whatever you do_ don't avoid the Colonoscopy!  But please_ Doctors_ Drug companies_ FDA people  can't we have this stuff mix in our bellies instead of in the plastic jug?  Let's stop pretending about ""great-tasting flavors"" and ""well-tolerated"".  I don't even want to know what point of reference you'd need to make those statements true.

I am actually drinking it right now and I can't get myself to finish the last glass. It is not so much the taste itself but the texture is thick and  does taste salty. I want to gag every time I taste it. I have to drink half the gallon today and the other half tomorrow morning and I am already extremely worried about the other half.

158, 2, colonoscopy prep,nausea_ vomiting,In preparation for the colonoscopy_ I ate lightly two days before. The day before_ I stuck to the liquid diet and took 4 Dulcolax at 3 p.m. I started the Nulytely prep at 5 p.m. I used the lemon-lime flavoring_ but couldn't really taste the flavor. It was neither good nor bad. I drank 8 oz. about every 15 to 20 minutes_ until about one-half way through. I then started vomiting. I got a little more down -- I think about 2/3 to 3/4 -- and then vomited every time I drank it. I stopped drinking at about 10 p.m._ but had not had a BM. (At this point_ I started gagging just by looking at a glass of Nulytely.) Finally_ at about midnight_ I had my first BM. And at about 2:00 a.m._ I started eliminations for real. This lasted until about 3:30 a.m. I had to be at the hospital at 6:00 a.m._ where they went ahead with the procedure_ even though I wasn't entirely cleansed. The doctor said that I had a recumbent intestine_ and explained that it was extra long with extra folds_ so it took longer for the Nulytely to get through my system. This explained the vomiting -- the Nulytely had nowhere to go_ once I had drunk the initial one-half -- as it was traveling through my system at a slower rate than I was drinking it. It also explained the period of time it took for me to have my first BM. Although the doctor found no polyps_ and irrigated as he went_ he said that he would rate my colonoscopy as only fair_ due to the inferior cleansing of my intestines.,M,67, ,4/24/2009,Nulytely
159, 5, colonoscopy prep,light nausea,As pleasant as this could be. I sniffed the various flavor packets to see which one was the least offensive. Orange seemed less saccharine than the rest but I never really ended up tasting it as I took apple juice shots before and after every straw-in-the-back-of-the-mouth chugfest.  First 3 glasses were a breeze. I recommend aiming for 20 minutes or so between glasses. Slow down as needed. Got progressively harder to drink as it went on. No effects until I was half done almost two hours after starting. I won't be finishing the last 16 ounces as a mild nausea set in at this mark and I've already had clear-to-yellow waterfalls for a while. Really not that bad_ much better than the food poisoning-like experience I'd anticipated as there was no cramping or abdominal pain.,F,26,0.3  days,4/9/2009,Nulytely

161, 5, Colonoscopy prep,Slight nausea; Chills,I wasn't expecting a fine wine_ and my expectations were met. I added the Lime flavoring and it reminded me of Gatorade. A salty_ flaovored drink. The problem is I never drink a gallon of anything in one sitting_ so to think this was not going to be a problem would be a bit naieve. Overall_ my only issues were that after 3 liters_ I began to get a gag reflex with each glass. I was a little naseous and experienced chills as others have stated. But it definitely works as advertised as about 90 minutes after I started i was running to the bathroom in between about every glass.

162, 3, Colonoscopy,Gagging,Thanks to others' comments here_ I was prepared. I did a low-res diet the day before and made sure I was stocked up on baby wipes. I took citrate of magnesium (so_ so much worse than the Nulytely) at 12 and that started things moving right away. By the time I started the Nulytely_ my BMs were already clearing up. I did find that the more I got myself worked up about how gross the stuff tastes_ the more likely I was to gag--I did actually vomit twice. So stay calm_ breathe_ and it'll be over soon!,F,30, ,4/2/2009,Nulytely
163, 5, colonoscopy,none,I didn't mind the taste at all. I shook a little from a flavor package into each glass so I could have all 4 flavors. I liked them all.

Helpful Info: It does not have to be clear in color like water since digestive juices will continue to tint the stool yellow and small flecks of debris are not a problem as long as the stool is not muddy or thick. It will take a few days after the procedure before you have a bowel movement.,F,42,1  days,3/26/2009Email,Nulytely

Sucking on a lime wedge before and after each glass was a huge benefit and allowed me to drink it without any problems.  I used very slight amount of Crystal Lite as flavoring but also tried the lemon-line flavor packet and it was OK also.  I only weigh 125 so I drank 6 oz every 15 minutes and avoided any nausea or bloating.  Things came out clear for over 2 hours and I stopped drinking after 2-1/2 liters.

168, 5, colonoscopy prep,Nothing unexpected.  Feeling a little crampy and bloated today_ after the procedure_ but not too bad.,I tolerated this prep very easily.  Went on a low residue diet a couple days before_ then had a good breakfast the day of prep (eggs and white toast)  I split the mix into 4 individual bottles so I could use all 4 flavors (remember to use only 1/4 of each flavor pack in each bottle).  My doctor said not to chill the drink and I didn't.  None tasted great_ but they weren't awful either.  I liked cherry and orange best.  Drinking thru a straw and chewing spearmint gum between drinks helped.  Managed a normal BM right after starting to drink (which I think really helped make the rest go smoothly).  Otherwise_ waited an hour and then enjoyed 90 minutes of regular activity (about every 10 minutes).    No significant bloating or other problems.  I recommend starting no later than 5pm to allow time to finish then have some broth before bed.  My biggest complaint is I was very hungry all night.

169, 1, Colonoscopy Prep,Nausea.  Violent vomiting (sore abs for days afterwards).,"My first experience was a failure.  I drank it quickly_ 2 liters in 1/2 hour (lemon-lime).  Going down_ it wasn't great_ but not completely horrible.  I had it ice cold and chased it with apple juice to cleanse the palate which seemed to work very well.  Then I sat and played video games for the next 2 1/2 hours waiting for it to work.  During that period I gradually began to experience heartburn and started burping up tiny amounts of the now body-temperature and increasingly vile-tasting fluid.  I distinctly remember thinking ""5 years between colonoscopies may not be enough time to forget this taste""  At the 2 1/2 hour mark I felt the intense urge to vomit and as far as I could tell_ the entire two liters came up in three violent convulsions.  The lemon-lime flavor is *much* worse coming up than going down.

Despite crawling fully clothed into bed and piling on the blankets_ I was unable to warm up completely until about six hours after I downed the last of the medication.  The gagging started about one-quarter of the way through.  By three-quarters the nausea was well along.  I was unable to drink the last six ounces and later vomited at least eight ounces.

If I didn't let saliva build up in my mouth while I had the fluid in there_ I would vomit it up.  I did projectile vomit once_ and I was very mad at myself-- I made a mess.  I think it's impossible to ""drink rapidly"" unless you want to vomit every time.  I would finish one 8oz glass in 1-2 minutes.  The whole process took me from 5:15 to ~9:00 with many trips to the bathroom after 6. Don't wipe every time_ the entire time I would dip the toilet paper in a water cup and pad for cleaning-- no soreness.

Chew gum - it helps!,Overall_ cleansing not as bad as I had feared. I feared selecting a flavor (4 liters) I couldn't stand. Husband suggested I make 4 one-liter preps so I could use different flavors in each. Get an electronic kitchen scale that weighs in grams. Carefully weigh out all of the dry powder from the Trilyte container. (Trilyte=Nulytely) Divide the total number of grams of powder by four and carefully measure out exactly one/fourth of the total amount into each of four ziploc sandwich bags.  Taste test each flavoring to select flavors you want to use.  I used 1/4 tsp flavoring per pre-measured bag of Trilyte powder and shook well to mix the dry powders. Open a 1 liter bottle of water and pour about 1/3 of it into a clean cup.  Use a dry funnel to pour the Trilyte/flavoring powder into the water bottle. Close the bottle and shake very well to dissolve all the solids. Reopen the bottle and pour the water from cup back into bottle to have a full liter.

186, 5, Colonoscopy,No side effects,"Huge thanks to many helpful suggestions posted herein.  I had a very good experience with NuLytetly.  No side effects_ no nausea_ etc.  I ate only broth for 4 days prior_ and then on ""game"" day I didn't need any stool softeners.  Rather than mixing the entire 650 ml powder into 4 litres of water_ I just mixed a 40 ml scoop of powder into each glass of liquid_ for a total of 16 glasses.  This way_ I could vary the taste with each glass_ which really helped_ esp. near the end.  My first two glasses were into pure apple juice_ and so it tasted exactly like AJ (yummy). The next 2 glasses were in pure Gatorade (also yum).  Then I switched to  different flavor crystals in water_ cuz of so much sweetness on an empty stomach.  The taste of NL in pure water incited gagging_ so I avoided that by quickly adding flavor crystals.  Orange & lemon-lime crystals best hid the NL.  A  straw_ bubble gum_ Desitin_ baby-wipes_ and cornstarch were great ideas that made t easier for me.  So di",M,52,1  days,1/19/2009,Nulytely

188, 4, Sigmoidoscopy prep,Bloating,So glad I found this page_ as it has great tips.  (My clinic gave very little information.)  Best tip is to mix it with 2-3 packets of Crystal Light (enough to make about a gallon).  The taste became a non-issue. (Was like thick_ salty lemonade.)  Another great tip is to go at your own pace.  I started slowly_ taking half a glass every 20 minutes.  I experienced some bloating but this subsided once I started excreting.  Thanks to this page_ I also knew to go on a liquid diet yesterday_ so it only took about ten bathroom trips before it was clear liquid.  Had VERY MILD nausea briefly because of the bloating but I found burping helped immensely.  I started to get really full near the end so I only drank 3 liters.  I feel for those who had horrible experiences with this.  Mine couldn't have been easier.,M,31,1  days,1/19/2009,Nulytely

Bowel movements did not begin as expected (1-2 hours after finishing first 2 quarts) but began in the middle of the night around 2am and continued until 7am the next morning so I ended up being up all night long before procedure.

The only problems were: it doesn't taste good but I could handle it (especially with the gatorade chaser); and I had some chills and aches and headache - maybe from also being hungry?

I'm ready_ I think_ to start up again and see how much more I can get down before I start vomiting again.,F,61,1  times,6/23/2008,Nulytely
228, 1, colonoscopy,chills_ extreme bloating_ gagging,The texture is the worst problem. It almost might be palatable with a chicken soup flavor. No flavoring helped. I mixed it about 1:1 with apple juice. I bloated up like a balloon. I took almost half the package of GasX. I tried hard candies_ ginger ale_ and water in between gulps. Using a straw was somewhat workable--just having the stuff touch my lips made me gag. Fortunately I had diarrhea (who can say that!) earlier today. I've only had half of the stuff and I'm quitting. My stool is pretty clear but very yellow--don't know if it's bile or apple juice. I should have taken the pills.,F,38,0.5  days,6/3/2008,Nulytely

I achieved the desired result but was not able to finish the entire 2 liters.  I stopped with about 1 more glass to go - just could not bring myself to take another mouthful.

My Dr. didn't give me much info on how you will feel and what you can do to to prepare for this solution. She did recommend addding Crystal Lite Lemonade to the solution_ which I recommend. After the first three cupfuls which went down pretty easy_ it then began to get harder and harder to drink. Luckily I had read here to switch over to a LOW FIBER_ liquid diet for the day before prep day. In between sipping the solution with a straw_ I also drank hot tea (to help w/ the chills). Later on I also found that eating Citrus popsicles and some jello helped. I camped out in the bathroom for a few hours-- As for timing_ I started around 4:30PM and estimate I was finished pretty much by 9PM. I drank another cupful until 10PM for good measure. Was able to sleep through the night w/out a problem. All systems go for my procedure for this afternoon. Here's hoping I don't have to do this again for 5 yrs!!,F,51,1  days,5/9/2008,Nulytely

Well_ thankfully I can report that this really was not that bad at all. Within 30 minutes of my first dose (8oz. every 15 minutes) I briefly thought I was going to throw up but started pooping instead. Going to the bathroom made me feel fine. After my 7th or 8th dose everything was coming out clear_ almost crystal clear! HOWEVER_ I still continued drinking the doses until the gallon was gone  like I said_ it is really not that bad.

I mixed the solution in the morning_ along with the lemon-lime flavor packet_ and chilled it.  My first cup was taken at 4:30 PM_ using a straw and drinking the entire cup quickly.  The viscosity was similar to water_ and it tasted like a lolly pop.  Happy surprise there.  I took a cup every ten minutes.  In truth_ you do feel a bit full until it kicks in_ but it was quite tolerable.  After you are in full swing you must be careful.  As there is no solid matter pushing to get out_ you feel a slight need to go_ not a strong need.  Head off to the bathroom at once and all will be well.  Yes_ towards the end it gets old_ and I spaced my last two cups at 20 minute intervals.  The only tip I recommend is to eat lightly the day before_ and fast the day of.

I chilled it w/o any flavor packets_ putting it in the freezer for about four hours.  I drank it through a straw_ and didn't think it tasted like much at all.  I sucked lemon wedges in between drinks.  I finished the full amount on schedule_ and was pretty clear about 2/3 of the way through.

I took four Ducolax tabs at 3pm and started the Nulytely at 5pm (prepped at 7am and refrigerated while at work) About 6:40pm and 1/2 through the container I started vomiting - basically what I had drank back up.  I waited 20 min and started again.  I did not have a bowel movement until 9:20 and I had finished the sol. at 8:20.  By the time my movements became almost clear it was midnight and I couldn't drink anything else to encourage my bowels to flush out more.  Although I thought I took it easy on the two days before the day before the surgery - next time I think I will do a liquid diet 3 days prior to the colonoscopy.  As for the flavor - I chose lemon lime but I am used to that type of flavor in stuff like Airborne.  The taste was nothing going down - coming back up was absolutely terrible.,F,24,1  days,4/1/2008,Nulytely

My orders were to eat nothing but clear liquids after waking and begin drinking the trilyte at 12 pm 8-10 oz. every 30 minutes so (of course) i chose to cut the interval to 15 minutes and chugged 10 oz in my favorite beer glass every 15 minutes using the oven timer until the jug was half empty then went to 20 minute intervals for the last half which made the time around 4pm....took effect after the first 3 chugs and a time or 2 after the last one...could have been worse i guess but now i'm looking forward(NOT)to getting up at 5 am to give myself tap water enemas  before i'm off to the scope-o-RAM-a.

Soreness on the anal area.  I did not have the chills or headaches that were warned about.,I used the Trilyte with flavor packs_ and I chose the orange flavor. I did not find it bad_ like orange flavored medicine.  It had a slight soapy appearance_ like the glass had some soap residue_ but not undrinkable. I was dreading this process based upon previous postings. I normally have a bad gag reflex_ so I was concerned about vomiting and not being able to complete the purge. I was pleasantly surprised. I was able to get down the 8 oz every 10 minutes_ and I started to excrete after 40 minutes.  It took 3 hours to ingest the entire 4 litter container_ and I continued to purge for at least one more hour_ but with less frequency. I did some things to get ready for the prep. I practiced downing 8 oz of water every 10 minutes for one hour. I did this practice session twice in the week prior to the prep.

268, 5, Colonoscopy,None,I had no problems.  I flavored it with the orange flavor.  I thought it tasted pretty good.  There was a slightly salty after taste that did not bother me at all.  I drank it through a straw.  I had no problem drinking the 4 liters.  Don't stress about the prep.  It all comes out fine in the end.,F,60,1  days,11/8/2007,Nulytely
269, 3, Colonoscopy,Chills_ very sore anus -- no one warned me about the latter. Towards the end my teeth were chattering because I was in such pain. I am not sure if this had anything to do with the NuLYTELY or if it would occur with any similar-acting medication.,I used the cherry flavoring and I doubt I will have any kind of cherry flavored drink for quite some time. However the taste wasn't terrible -- it was having to drink so much of it! There has to be an easier way.,M,51,1  days,10/21/2007,Nulytely
270, 4, colonoscopy prep,nausea_ vomiting_ mild chills,"Well_ I puked.  Twice.  But I'm a puker_ so it's to be expected_ and the stuff still worked (they sure give you enough of it).  After the second vomiting incident_ I came up with a brilliant idea: LEMON JUICE!  I'd already used the orange flavoring_ but it wasn't really helping that much.  The lemon juice provided just enough of a pucker to mask the salty/soapy-ness_ and I could add additional squirts as I needed to.  It's looking like I'll have a few more colonoscopies in my lifetime_ so I'm happy I've come up with a ""solution"" that works for me.",F,25,1  days,10/17/2007,Nulytely
271, 4, Colonoscopy Prep,Chills_ mild bloating_ vomiting_ VERY sore bottom,I was on a clear diet all day and took two dulcolax at 4. I started drinking at 6 and was okay for the first 7 glasses. After #8_ I began throwing up_ but still managed to get down 3 more glasses. At 8_ I took 2 more dulcolax_ and then the real fun began. Chasing the glass with juice really helped me! I became clear very quickly_ however because I had eaten mostly lime gatorade and green jello_ had nothing but green juice coming out...so I kept drinking! The nurse this morning said I could have stopped after it was free of solid. So_ word to the wise-no green jello on prep day. I did seem to have a little warning before needing to go and slept pretty well for most of the night (only got up 3 times). All in all_ I had expected to spend all night on the potty and vomit for hours. While this medicine did its job_ I would have greatly preferred the pills.

Drank Trilyte Solution_ 1 8oz cup every 10-20 minutes. Got almost all of it down(1.5 cups down the drain!) before i started getting massive water cravings. Some residual solids and then it was straight hose action_ out me bum! I've never experienced anything so awkward.

274, 3, Colonoscopy/Endoscopy Prep,Mild chills/gas/no biggie,The last time I did this (5 yrs. ago)I thought I would die of pain. This time I was much more prepared. The key is the low fiber/liquid diet ahead of time so you are not plugged up or too full of poop before you start. Oh_ and I drank two nice sized cups of very warm boullion and ate a little jello right before so I was hydrated_ had a little salt and sugar on board before starting. I used the Trilytely_ added lemon/lime_ and about another teasponful of sacharin until it was kind of sweet. Used Tucks wipes and zinc oxide between explosions and my butt was just fine after all the pooping. This time was a piece of cake compared to the last.,F,60, ,9/30/2007,Nulytely

I continued drinking it and yep you guessed it_ it happened again and I was almost done. I was not happy about this I put alot of effort into the prep and had almost no results for it. now I need to start all over again but I will do it because the other alternative is not one that I want to chance with the side effects.

276, 1, colonoscopy,"Soon after a colonoscopy procedure on 6.5.07 I became aware of fatigue and chest pressure with exercise.  A primary doctor appointment was scheduled. A blood test revealed ""renal insufficiency"" with 2.2 Creatinine and 10.5 Hemoglobin levels.  I next proceeded to a urologist and an ultrasound of kidneys_ tract and bladder which revealed nothing unusual. A week later a nephrologists diagnosis was ""acute not chronic renal failure"" with some kidney self repair indicated by blood tests. The nephrologist questioned me on ""what major medical event"" had transpired since perfectly normal blood panels on 2.23.07.  I had no major issues to advise and did not consider a colonoscopy as major medical event. The nephrologist suggested a prompt visit to a hematologist. A hematologists diagnosis on 7/20 was a acute kidney reaction  to my colonoscopy bowel prep Nulytely (4 liters).

This time I used (generic) Trilyte & it actually went OK.  Moderated my diet for 2 days beforehand - clear liquids the day of prep. Used Trilyte without any flavoring -- it wasn't that bad -- much better than the cherry flavored Nulytely. Took it somewhat slower than prescribed - 15 to 20 min. much of the time.  Sucked a lemon after some of the doses. 5 hrs start to finish.  You can do it!",M,54,1  days,9/3/2007,Nulytely
279, 4, Colonscopy,I did not experience any side effects.  No cramping or bloating,I mixed the Nulytely with room tempature water the night before and did not add any flavor.  When I had to start drinking it I mixed 8ozs with a little bit of Crystal Light lemonade flavor and shook it up real good and drank it cold with a straw. I mixed up my next 8ozs and placed it in the freezer to get it really cold.   It did not taste near as bad as I was expecting from many of the postings.  It was like flat lemonade.  Very tolerable but I really don't want any lemonade for a while!  Just keep a positive attitude and you will do fine.,F,50,1  days,8/28/2007,Nulytely
280, 4, Colonoscopy,Aggravated hemorrhoids,While it wasn't fun spending 8-9 hours in the bathroom over two days (I drank half in the evening and the other half the next morning)_ the Nulytely wasn't nearly as bad as I thought. My only real discomfort was initiated by the magnesium citrate laxative used to get things moving - that stuff really stings coming out. Plain Nulytely has even less flavor than tap water_ if that's possible. The clinic suggested sucking on lime wedges before and after each drink_ and that really helped. I found it also helps psychologically if you break each cup down into two four-ounce servings and swig them one after the other. Also_ distract yourself from thinking about the next dose. I set a kitchen timer for 10 minutes and read a good mystery novel. For sore butt_ try washing off with a shower hose instead of using TP or wipes.,F,60,2  days,8/28/2007,Nulytely

282, 5, Colonoscopy,Bloating,Doctor prescribed 4 Dulcolax followed by Trilyte with instructions to drink a minimum of 2 litres.  I followed a low-residue diet for 24 hours before taking the Dulcolax_ and then just clear liquids. Used the Citrus Berry flavor in the Trilyte_ but honestly it worked best by drinking it fast through a straw while holding my nose with my other hand to bypass as much taste sensation as possible_ followed by a mouth rinse and a sip of cold gingerale.  Not pleasant_ but doable.  Drank about 3 litres until the 'effluent' was clear. Kept Desitin on my bottom - wiped with baby wipes_ not much irritation.  My experience was no where near as horrible as others.,F,50, ,8/15/2007,Nulytely
283, 4, Prep for Colonoscopy,Nausea_ abdominal pain_ intestinal pain_ severe bloating_ cramping,I used Trilyte. I used the orange flavor. I let it chill.

Ok so I drank every 10 min_ then around 7:30ish I thought I had a little gas but when I tried to expel it splash I had diarea_ ran to the toliet and it just shot out_ like a fire hydrant.

I still have the other half of the bottle to drink - not sure I will finish it since it seems like I am pretty well cleaned out.  I did not consume much in the way of bulky foods this past week due to my stomach being so sore_ I think that helped.

The tips on this site helped a great deal.I opened each of the flavor packets and chose the one that smelled the most palatable to me.I added warm water and the powder was pretty easy to dissolve after shaking.The dry powder smelled like glue. The mixed solution with the lemon/lime packet smelled just fine.Rinsing my mouth with white grape juice after each glass helped with the taste_ which wasn't that bad - it was like drinking mineral water.  A sip or two of ginger ale once or twice helped the gas in my stomach from drinking so much so quickly.  If you are looking to make this prep easier_ start eating lightly and eliminate solid food the night BEFORE the prep - mine was a morning procedure on Day 3 so on Day 1 I stopped solid food and went to clear liquids from dinnertime on.I only had to drink about 2/3 of the jug - about 2 1/2 hours - because my movements became watery more quickly than if I had been eating norm,F,59,1  days,7/19/2007,Nulytely

At nook I took 4 pills _ slight bowel movement - drank 1 gallon by the glassful (taste was horrible).  I have bad reflux_ on the last glassful I threw up some of the prep liquid.  By Thursday morning I still did not have any bowel movement - so resorted to 2-fleets.  I was scheduled for both an upper and lower.  On the upper GI all of the nulytly was sitting in my stomach_ and stuck to the walls of my stomach.  The doctor put in fluid and rinsed to pull out some of the liquid_ but the gel substance was still stuck to the walls of my stomach (or so the nurse explained) so they could complete the upper GI.  They could not do the lower GI because the prep didn't work.  Now I have to do the entire thing over again next week_ which means 2 more days of clear liquid and missing 2 more days of work.

Windex blue colored liquid after about three hours.",I breaks down into about 16 eight ounce glasses_ the first ten were not that hard_ it was a real slog to get that gallon down.  I am wondering if the gallon is appropriate for everyone_ we all weigh differently and the instructions from the gastro indicated a three hour difference in onset.  I chose the lemon-lime flavor packet and while it changed the odor_ it didn't make it taste like lemon-lime at all.  Flavor was slightly salty and texture was oily.  I can't help but wonder if using beef or chicken bullion wouldn't be a better flavoring_ since those are salty and on the allowed list.,M,38,1  days,7/9/2007,Nulytely

I agree with hundreds of others that won't have the procedure done for the mere fact that drinking a gallon of this nasty stuff has to be done.  I had the procedure done on 01 Jun and hardly made it through the gallon.  Because of a very large polyp with no stem_ I had to have another procedure done 03 Jul and thought I was going to explode by drinking that stuff.  I have to have this done in 3 mo. again and my dr. won't give me the pills to take_ so I'm going to take someone's suggestion and suck a lemon (I'm adding salt) before and after every glass_ it can't be worse than what we have to go through.  The flavors are horrid and to date_ I don't want to smell or taste anything that has to do with lemon-lime or oranges.  The other flavors are disgusting too.

The taste isn't to bad. I am just tired of drinking the stuff. Drinking 8 oz. every 15 minutes. I will be so glad when I am through. I am drinking cranberry juice in between and it helps. Will be glad when things turn clear. I feel like the muddy mississippi river is coming out of my body. Hang in there everyone_ you can do it. Someone should make up T shirts stating I survived this stuff. I thought about adding a little bit of Bourbon in each glass. That would make it taste better and after awhile you wouldn't care how long it took Good luck everyone.,M,67, ,4/18/2007,Nulytely
312, 3, Colonoscopy Prep,Nausea while drinking...just started Horrible flavor-causing gaggingstomach upset-gurgling_ icky feeling,Called pharmacist to see if they had the flavor packets..nope.  She said try adding one packet of koolaid.  I haven't tried that yet.  I have gotten through 2 glasses so far_ with my 4 year old sitting making faces at me trying to make it go by easier_ and a life-saver sitting waiting for me to finish the glass.  So far I haven't gotten close to finishing_ but figured I would write my experience so far.  LMAO at some of the comments!  That helps!,F,25, ,4/18/2007,Nulytely
313, 1, Colonoscopy,Nausea_ vomiting,"This was almost like torture-- I know it's a necessary evil to get the procedure done_ but PLEASE_ in this modern day & age there has to be a better way. It was bad enough that I had to STARVE myself all day (and no more lemon Jello for me_ EVER) but then to have to deal with this stuff was just too much. I should have guessed what I was in for when I handed the pharmacist my RX and she says ""Oh_ no_ you poor thing."" great intro. It did start to work within an hour_ but I am barely a third of the way through that horrrendously large bottle_ and there is NO WAY I can finish it. If that means I can't get my colonoscopy done then so be it_ I just simply cannot ""buck up"" and drink it_ it's physically impossible.

314, 3, Colonoscopy Prep,Chills_ extreme envy of those who were eating dinner tonite,I have experienced none of the cramping that some have reported suffering through_ and only mild bloating.  Although I just completed the entire gallon minutes ago - 3 hours elapsed time since the first drink - I've only had one bowel movement (although I think more are immediately forthcoming ...).  Nasty tasting stuff - gelatinous saltwater comes to mind.  The chills are rather pronounced (typing is an adventure)_ and hope that the medicine winds up doing what it's supposed to do.,M,51, ,4/16/2007,Nulytely
315, 3, colonoscopy,Bloated_ nausea feeling after taking the medication as prescribed. The stuff was very difficult to continue drinking after the first hour or so and didn't produce any results for almost 2 hours of intake. The only way to finish the entire amount was to suck on some mints between drinks so the chalk like taste would disappear. Did complete the entire gallon and it apparently did it's job but there has to be a better way to clean a colon!,Taste like cherry flavored chalk. Bad after taste.,M,50,1  days,4/13/2007,Nulytely
316, 4, Colonoscopy,Slight chills.,I was dreading the prep for my colonoscopy. After having done it_ I have some really useful tips. The day of the prep_ I drank a glass of water every 20 minutes about 4 hours before I started the Nulytely. This helped TREMENDOUSLY in not feeling bloated or nauseous during prep. What also helped is drinking a sip or two of ginger ale after drinking each glass. It takes away the taste and makes burping easier which greatly reduces bloating. Also_ I walked around outside in the sun after each glass in the first hour or so_ before it kicked in_ and that helped with chills and eased any tummy discomfort. Honestly_ it is not that bad and it was worth it to be healthy. Just make sure you drink a lot of water before you start - that will help so much. Good luck and just do it!,F,42,1  days,4/12/2007,Nulytely
317, 4, Colonoscopy,No side effects. No nausea_ no vomiting_ no cramps_ no chills_ Kinda sore bottom (used Vaseline prior to and during prep along with baby wipes)_ no dizziness. I was expecting the worst_ but was very pleasantly surprised. Stomach growls and don't take chances...it's NOT going to be gas - go to the bathroom and sit down to be safe!,"I opted for the Orange flavor.  The pharmacist gave me all 4 flavor packs so I opened them all up_ smelled them_had a ""yes/ no/maybe"" pile and tasted them (pinapple and orange were the runners) Orange won. My Dr. recommended that I take Magnesium Citrate (the night before the day I started the NuLytely) around 5pm (green bottle). And that I start drinking the NuLytley at 1pm every 30 min. the day before the procedure. Different from what the package suggests but it works and you're not always dreading the time. A GOOD SUGGESTION: it was recommended that I put it in the freezer until it gets slushy. I barely tasted anything. AND_ I drank  it with a straw - it goes down faster and then I ate the icey part that was left. I poured each serving in a measuring cup and drank right out of that. Hope this helps.",F,34,1  days,4/2/2007,Nulytely

319, 5, Colonoscopy,No side effects. No nausea_ no vomiting_ no cramps_ no chills_ no sore bottom (used Vaseline prior to and during prep)_ no dizziness_ NOTHING.  I was expecting the worst_ but was very pleasantly surprised.,"Since my mucosal lining is ""highly sensitive"" to the ingredients other preps_ I spoke with my Dr. and we agreed that the Nulytely was the way to go for me.  I used the Nulytely WITHOUT adding any flavoring that came with it.  It tasted like mineral water without the carbonation or like alka seltzer that had gone flat.  For me_ it was a breeze to drink_ but I would recommend drinking each glass down fast rather than sipping.  Slow up if you start to feel bloated_ you have plenty of time (hours) to do this.  Remember your goal it to take sufficient quantity for a successful cleansing_ NOT how fast you can drink this stuff.  Better to drink slower and take longer than to do it fast and risk bloating or cramps or vomiting and not get enough to do the job.  I started with 15 mins between each 8 oz. glass for the first 4 glasses.  Then went to 10 mins between each 8 oz. glass till I finished.  I will be the first to admit that everyone is different_ but this worked well for me.  If",M,57, ,3/25/2007,Nulytely

Starting drinking around 4pm; it did not taste bad at all but I still chugged it.  Drank a glass every 10 minutes until I started to feel uncomfortable then slowed to every 15.  When I started to feel very bloated and nauseous_ I took a one hour break from drinking (as per the directions from the pharmacy).  After that_ the side effects subsided and I was able to drink about 3.5 of the 4 liters in 4 and a half hours.  Was done about 9pm and still had watery BMs until about midnight and woke up twice in the middle of the night to go.  Also_ still had to go a few times in the morning before the colonoscopy but it wasn't a big deal.

After reading reviews_ I figured i'd give it a shot since I wasn't too worried about the taste.  I was gagging from the first sip_ not from the taste but the texture.  Someone I managed half the bottle in two hours_ and then vomited up what must have been a liter and a half of liquid.. so obviously this wasn't going to work for me. Probably not going to end up having the colonoscopy tomorrow. I'll have to find a new prep and reschedule.  I do not recommend this product.,F,24,1  days,2/5/2007,Nulytely
326, 5, Colonoscopy prep,Mild bloating; chills,...(continued from below)...  medicine they don't like? You tell them they have to take it because it will make them better right? Well_ that's the same thing with Nulytely. If you have to have a colonoscopy for the sake of your health_ then you need to take a colon cleanser to ensure the safety of your test. To people coming here for advice about Nulytely here are my recommendations: 1)follow a low-residue diet for several days before the prep and drink lots of water (this will help things start faster which will minimize the bloating which I found to be the worst part; 2)use a soda you like as a chaser (this will help mask the taste and also help you burp which will relieve some of the pressure); 3) don't listen to the 1-ratings on here. There is no question that this is not a pleasant prep_ but it is nowhere near as horrible as some of these people make it out to be.

329, 3, colonoscopy,Nausea,"I used the lemon-lime flavoring in the Nulytely because I thought it would be the most ""neutral"" flavor...WRONG!  I managed to drink up about 6 - 8 cups without any problem_ but then the gag reflex kicked in and it was all I could do to choke the rest down. I had to quit with about an inch or so remaining in the jug because I thought I was gonna lose it!  The stuff has an obnoxious salty thickness that makes it hard to swallow.  Tip: Make sure to keep it chilled (overnite) very cold - it tasted much worse when I left the jug out of the fridge for awhile. Also_ start early because it takes more than 4 - 5 hours to complete if you become ill from the taste! FYI - I also used 10 oz. of Magnesium Citrate the day before and 4 tabs of Ducolax one hour before the Nulytely.  The Doc said I had excellent results...duh!",M,45,1  days,12/14/2006,Nulytely

Only had to drink about 2/3 of jug before desired results came. Stayed up until 11:30 pm drinking water to make sure I didn't get dehydrated. Drank over 128 oz water beyond the 3 liters or so of Nulytely that day.  Found I had to stay near bathroom_ but not IN it the whole time.

333, 4, colonoscopy prep,none,I used the generic for Nulytely called Trilytely which comes with 4 flavor packets -- I chose the cherry flavor because it smelled the strongest. The doc's directions were to drink a cup every 15 min for 4 hours.  I drank the first four cups in one hour but after that I was able to drink only a cup every 30 min. It took me 5.5 hours to consume 12 cups (3 qts) but it did the trick and I happily poured the last qt down the sink.  I weigh only 110 lbs -- obviously not everyone needs to drink the full gallon and you don't have to drink it in 4 hours.  3 qts in 5.5 hours did the trick for me.,F,51,1  days,11/28/2006,Nulytely

336, 5, Prep for Colonoscopy,Absolutely no side effects.,Based on what I had read on this site_ I was very apprehensive about taking Nulytely.  I had my supply flavored with pineapple. I followed the instructions to the letter and had 8 ounces (1 cup) of well chilled Nulytely every 10 minutes.  One cup at a time I found to be very manageable.  Based on input from others_ I had expected the taste to be quite vile.  In fact_ it was tolerable.  Granted_ if someone served this to me in a barroom_ I would definitely not order another.  My suggestion for anyone who has to take Nulytley would be to make sure you limit your intake to no more than ONE CUP every ten minutes.,M,65,1  days,10/30/2006Email,Nulytely

I would rather take a pile of laxatives or have a dozen enemas than repeat this experience. It would be a pleasure to throw up. My body will not accept one more sip.,F,51,1  days,7/26/2006,Nulytely
352, 1, colonoscopy,My husband took this for a colonoscopy test WAS going to make me taste the stuff too ... After his first glass he decided that he would not make me taste it .....,He said it tasted like DISH-SOAP. PUKED up the first glass ... had a terrible time choking down the rest .... drank aboug 3.5 liters then when he started crapping clear liquid he dumped the rest out ... then I had to give him Ducolax to make sure he was really clean ... I am certain he will NEVER EVER FRIGGIN drink this stuff again ... and there IS NO WAY IN HELL I will do this test unless I can take a pill ..... I was gagging just thinkint about it.He used the Cherry flavor pack and the flavor pack actually smelled really good !!! but you cant make SOAP taste good .... Every time he took a glass full I had to leave the room because of his gagging and he did puke up a couple of gulps  NEVE EVER will I use this nor will He ever do it again .... He would rather DIE than drink this stuff again,M,40,1  days,7/13/2006,Nulytely
353, 1, prep for colonoscopy,Unable to drink it without it coming up.  I gave it my best effort and every sip came back up  Tried to take a drug to stop the vomitting but it just didn't work.  The doctor switched me to a pill form.  It and worked perfectly.I had to take 40 pills but it beat the drink.,I will never tolerate nulytley again for me.

This is supposed to be the worst part_ so....,M,57,1  days,7/10/2006,Nulytely
355, 5, colonoscopy prep,feeling very full_ anal burning and discomfort but I put neosporin with pain relief on and that helped,"I got the plain flavored and the went down fine. It tastes the tiniest bit salty but not bad.  Nothing happened for the first 45 minutes and I was afraid it was not working.  It really worked then after the 45 minute mark with explosive watery diarehea about every 15 minutes.  My doctor said I must have clear or light yellow discharge for a full hour before I could stop drinking it and at about the 2 hour mark I was light yellow and no poo showing up with it.  Then after about 30 minutes with only 30 to go my ""discharge"" went darker yellow and had bits of poo in it.  GREAT!  So I had to keep drinking and finally poured the last glass down the sink- I just don't want to do this anymore.  I will drink myself into oblivion with apple juice and crystal light.  The other truly bad thing is I am diabetic so that limits beverage choices quite a bit.",F,40,1  days,7/6/2006,Nulytely

357, 3, Colonoscopy,Somewhat bloated feeling after two 8 oz glasses.,"This liquid tastes like soapy sea water.  The first glass or two went down ""OK"" but after that it was all I could do to keep from gagging.  There must be some way to make it less soapy and salty.  It took me 10 hours to drink all but the last few ounces.  It wasn't until early the next morning that I finally experienced a somewhat yellowish evacuation.",M,54,1  days,6/28/2006,Nulytely
358, 4, colonoscopy prep,Nothing unexpected,Of course I would have preferred a Bombay Saphire martini_ straight up_ shaken_ but Nulytely wasn't the worst thing I've ever had to drink.

359, 1, Colonoscopy_ Bowel prep,Nausea_ chills,I had lemon-lime flavored_ but the taste was anything but good. It was thick and just disgusting to drink. I tried numerous things to mask the taste_ mixing it with sprite_ crystal light_ using a soda or broth chaser...bottom line it took me 4 and a half hours to finish the gallon_ i burst into tears towards the end becasue i just wanted to be done. My stomach just couldnt stomach this stuff_ it got progressively harder to fight my gag reflex. It did the job of preping my bowels_ but was much harder to drink than i ever could have imagined.,F,26,1  times,6/11/2006,Nulytely
360, 1, colonoscopy,I threw most of it up.  It tasted like floor cleaning solution. (lemon-lime).  I am supposed to go in this am_ but don't know if they can do the test_ since I got rid of most of the solution by vomiting,,F,59, ,5/25/2006,Nulytely

362, 3, colonoscopy,dizziness_ chills_ nausea_ cramping,The pharmacist told me to try a flavour I wouldn't mind ruining my enjoyment of_ so I used the Pineapple. Drinking the solution reminds me of chugging a glass of whole milk (which I hated drinking) as a child; repeat ad nauseum. The flavour (sort of) masked the salty aftertaste_ which (along with the thick texture) is remniscent of Pedialyte. Having been on clear liquids since waking_ the transition to a nearly clear movement took only half the jug and 2 hours. I had to take a break after that_ though_ as  I became too chilled to finish a full glass.,F,25,1  times,4/10/2006,Nulytely
363, 5, colonoscopy prep,I used the lemon-lime flavor.  It tasted better than I expected it to taste.  I drank the whole jug of NuLytely_ and the effects were mild.,From many comments I had read_ I thought this would taste horrible_ but that is not the case.,F,63,1  days,4/5/2006,Nulytely
364, 4, Colonoscopy Prep,There were no side effects_ but the bowel contractions continued to produce gas and liquid_ for six hours after finishing the 3 Liters I used to clean out my bowel.,I started the prep at 3 PM. The taste is gross_ even cold! I used it without flavoring_ because all of the flavors contain Maltodextrin_ which gives me gas. I drank an 8 ounce glass every 10 minutes until 12 glasses were swallowed. Since I fasted for the entire day_ it only took 4 or 5 glasses to clean me out.,M,63,1  days,4/2/2006,Nulytely

After that every single drop was a struggle to get down.My gag reflex kicked in and I came close to stopping 1/3 through. I had the cherry ""flavor"". Within an hour of beginning to drink Nulytely I had bowel movements_ which were moderately explosive.

My second colonoscopy - first time was Golightly - I don't remember having this much difficulty getting it down. There HAS to be a better way. Just looking at the glass makes me gag and shake with chills. Used the Cherry flavor - tried sips of 7up in between gulps. It's been 4.5 hours. It's successful - things are moving_ but I can't drink another drop - I don't care if they scream at me tomorrow for my colonoscopy - Don't recommend this AT ALL.

369, 1, Colonoscopy Prep,Chills_ vomitting_ and cramps.,I had the orange flavor.  Let me tell you_ no flavor can mask the taste of this stuff!  It is horrible!  I enjoy life but when drinking this stuff the thought of death sounded better than life!  I vomitted it up after 2 glasses and then had to try to drink it again later and got nauseous after 3 glasses and then stopped! This is the worst drink I've had ever...tastes like chalk!

371, 5, colonoscopy prep,None. I drank the entire jug (the pharmacist called it the 'party pack') 8 oz. at a time over a 4 hour period. I had two mild_ not really very urgent yet very copious movements over this time period. I feel fine. I'm confident the colonoscopist will have a clear view tomorrow morning.,It all went pretty much as planned. I was prepared for the worst after reading these comments_ but was pleasantly disappointed. I had the cherry flavor_ and the taste was OK. It has a bit of a unpleasant oily texture to it going down_ but I found it tolerable.,M,51,1  days,2/14/2006,Nulytely

373, 4, colonoscopy prep,mild chill_ nausea_ vomiting,After reading posted comments_ I was very apprehensive about drinking the Nulytely.  My apprehension was unwarrented.  The taste of the liquid is not very good_ but I have had picnic lemonade that was worse_ so I just thought of it as bad lemonade. Bowel movements began about one hour after I started to drink.  I had done a very light diet (mostly liquid) for three days before_ so there was little residue remaining.  When I had about a quart left_ I decided to try to chug it just to get done.  This was a mistake_ as I then threw up a lot of it.  My recommendation:  eat lightly on the days before the prep_ adopt an easygoing attitude_ and don't be as worried as I was.  The overall experience was not at all as bad as I anticipated!  Relax.  The colonoscopy can be a lifesaving test_ well worth the slight inconvenience.,F,59,1  days,1/25/2006,Nulytely
374, 1, colonoscopy,Hear Ye Hear Ye--Experience of a lifetime. It gutted me out like a dead fish.  I have never felt so refreshed.  I feel sorry for my toilet.

More palatable if taken on the side with Crystal Light lemonade.  Finished the 4 liters in about 3 hours.  Started defacating after the 8th glass. Turned cloudy yellow after the 12th glass.

387, 5, Colonoscopy prep,None,This was not anywhere near as bad as I expected. Got the lemon-lime flavor_ and it tasted like...well_ lemon-lime flavored water_ with a salty aftertaste. I was thirsty when I started (6:30 PM)_ so I easily put down a glass every 10 min for the first 1 1/2 hours. Then I started to feel bloated and bored with the taste_ so I slowed down. I felt less bloated after I finally defecated about 2 1/2 hours later (9:00PM). My stool was completely liquid diarrhea_ without any solid feces or any gas. No nausea_ no vomiting_ no cramps_ no discomfort. It took about 6 hours to finish drinking the 4 liters. It caused me to have about 6 quick bowel movements (about 45 min. apart) that evening. Although the instructions say to drink until the color of your diarrhea becomes yellowish-cloudy_ I had to drink the entire 4 liters before my stool went from dark brown to just cloudy. I expelled clear liquid stool twice the next morning (6AM and 9AM)_ and had my procedure at 11AM. It_ too_ was a breeze.,M,50,1  days,5/2/2005,Nulytely

389, 1, colonoscopy prep,this is my second time trying to take nulytely. The first time_ I started taking it_ I vomited tremendously_ I had severe stomach pains_ I was shaking_ had real bad cramps and chills. I also started diarreha and voiding all at the same time. I also experienced muscle weakness that entire day_ I could not make it down stairs until my children call the doctor and notified them of my symptoms and they told me to stop the nulytely. From all the vomiting that I did_ my whole body became very very very sore. I felt like someone had physically abused my body. My chest cavity was so sore that I could not even laugh or cough. This second time around with nulytely; well I did the same thing today_ I still could not consume the whole entire laxative solution_ again the vomiting started and the same things started to happen all over again_ until I recommended another laxative (magnesium citrate). So I will not know my results until I go in for the colonoscopy procedure tommorow which happens to be 4/6/05. But I will never recommend the nulytely to anyone. That stuff is discusting. I have never never in my life tasted such bad vile liquid as the nulytely. I hope in the near future that they can provide a better laxative solution for anyone that has to take the colnoscopy prep.,I hate it_ I hate it with a PASSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Nulytely is a nightmare for anyone who has to take it.I never disagreed with a medicine before_ but this is such a nasty_dissatisfing solution_ I hope everyone can avoid.,F,34,2  weeks,4/5/2005,Nulytely

The sheer volume of liquid you have to take in such a short period of time adds to the cause of nausea and vomiting.

It took awhile to get THAT thru my gastro's head so I found information on other preps online and gave my gastro the choice_ no scope or we try another product for the prep! I eventually won and have used lemon-ginger flavored or unflavored PhosphoSoda or lemon flavored Magnesium Citrate for every scope since that first.,Every gastro who scripts this prep should have to drink the entire solution once a year as a reminder and an incentive to find other alternatives.
