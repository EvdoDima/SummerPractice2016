0, 1, allergy shots,dizzyness_ irritabilty_ blurred vision_ feeling amped up,would rather be sleepy on Benadryl.   Currently on allergy shot regimen_ and they want me to take anti histamines to prevent reaction.   Allegra is the only med I take and it makes me feel awful.   Mean_ dizzy_ cant focus my eyes.

1, 1, Seasonal allergies,"Have been taking Allegra on and off for over a year. Been taking it regularly now for over a month due to high allergy season. Have been suffering from dizziness_ vertigo_ ear pain_ tinnitus_ fullness in ears_ mood swings to point where my husband and children have stayed clear of me_ lack of energy_ recent muscle spasms in legs and feet like ""Charlie horses"" that awaken me in the night_ depression for no reason_ feeling ""out of it"" unable to concentrate_ blurred vision_ dry eyes_ neck pain_ lower back pain_ stomach pain_ feeling discontent. I do not suffer from depression. Have suffered from insomnia and was taking trazodone for that. Stopped taking it thinking THAT was the cause of my symptoms. Felt better the next day. No dizziness or vertigo for 3 days. Turns out I had stopped taking trazodone AND allegra at the same time be said I thought I was getting too dried out and that was causing inner ear problem. Started to sneeze and itch so took Allegra. Then next day my dizziness_ nausea_ fullness in ears_ tinnitus_ etc returned. Now after reading these posts I believe it was the ALLEGRA that was causing my issues all along. I just took my last dose today. And I'm not going to let my teenage daughters take it again either as they've experienced similar but less frequent side effects too!",,F,46,1  years30 mg 1x D,6/21/2016,Allegra

4, 1, Dermograpism,I suffer from Dermograpism and it had recently flared up. I went to cvs and asked a pharmacist his recommendation because I had already been on prednisone. He recommended Allegra and it worked wonderfully for the itchiness and welts that I would get. However_ I would never use this again due to its side effects. I've had trouble sleeping_ sore throat_ stomach problems_ joint and muscle pain especially in my shoulders and arms and am very weak. I would rather endure the flare ups of my Dermograpism than to feel completely helpless and in constant pain and discomfort. Never again.,I am hoping this is out of my system soon.

8, 1, Allergies,Psychiatric disturbances_ back pain_ dry eyes_ peeling lips_ tooth pain_ fatigue_ constipation,Wow. Where to start. I've been taking Allegra on and off for a few years_ but I recently started taking it almost every day due to sinus issues. It seems that the side effects have been building up over time. I have an autoimmune disease that causes joint pain_ but I started experiencing an abnormal presentation of back pain after a few weeks of daily dosing. I was considering going back on immunosuppressants to resolve this pain. I also started experiencing heightened anxiety_ feeling like I was going to have a meltdown at work. Eventually I started feeling lethargic/depressed/empty and was ready to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist. I also started noticing peeling_ dry lips_ loss of appetite_ and constipation. I didn't realize that it could be the Allegra causing these issues_ as I have a few chronic health problems that can present with similar symptoms_ but I have been feeling more like my old self after cessation of my Allegra regimene. I don't even think that my allergies are that much worse without Allegra.,M,28,6  months180mg,4/1/2016,Allegra

10, 1, Dust allergy and full ears,My legs feel weak_ heavy and jumpy.  I feel dizzy and unsteady even when just standing. I feel out of it like I can't think straight and there is a feeling of doom which leads to anxiety and a fear that something is terribly wrong.  The insomnia is terrible. I can fall asleep because of being extremely tired late at night but wake up a couple hours later with the feeling of doom and anxiety and then I am unable to fall back asleep.  The med seems to work when I first take it for my full ears but then about six hours in it starts to wear off and then the side effects start.  Awful feeling!,After trying this a few times and getting the same results each time I'm concluding its the med.  I'm throwing it out!  Never again!

11, 1, sinus infection,To my friends and family that I recommended ALLEGRA to_ I'm very sorry. 2015_ I took ALLEGRA D 24 and I ended up at urgent care. I could not urinate. 10mins in a stall and all I could manage was a trickle. I thought I had kidney stones. Got a really bad sinus infection_ 2016. Thought I would give it a try again. This time I took ALLEGRA D 12hr_ drank 3 bottles of water and same side effect. In a stall with tear coming out one eye. I was a Marine but it hurts that bad. I drank a total of 10 bottle waters_ a large glass at dinner and glass by my bed. I'm having fever aches_my mouth is very dry_ the roof of my mouth burns_ I'm so restless that I can't sleep and it still takes 5mins to pee. I'm done with ALLEGRA. NEVER AGAIN.

I lost my taste for several hours on the 10th day taking Allegra_ and took one more pill on day 11_ then I completely lost my smell and taste. I quit Allegra for good on day 12_ and now it is day 13 my smell and taste still not coming back. Someone said here her taste was gone for one and half year! I hope it does not take me that long! This was the third winter since I had severe allergy and it was the first time I tried to take allergy pills on a regular basis. I did not take any allergy medicine the past two winters and I survived. Allegra made my congestion worse.

They said to take Azelastine_ but after reading the reviews they are too similar to this med so I will not take anything but natural for now.",Never again!

I wish I would've came here first before taking it and I was really freaked out. Also it says something about this product that I was feeling these symptoms only after 2 days of taking this.

18, 1, seasonal allergies,My twin grandsons took this with doctors instructions due to runny noses and coughs due to allergies.  After four days one of the twins mood changed he seemed sad and started acting out in daycare very angry and hitting also acted out during water play almost afraid of water which was not usual behavior.  He started hitting other children and the only thing that had changed was putting him on medicine.  His twin started to show signs of being defiant.  I immediately stopped giving them tbe medicine which tookaanother week to get them back to their normal selves. Very scary and sad that they couldn't express themselves and state how they were feeling.  I can't imagine what the outcome would have been if I didn't put two and two together the long term effect it wouldhhave done.  Afterwards I read these reviews my suspicions were confirmed.  Parents should be aware very difficult to watch a child go thru this.  I immediately threw out medicine.  I would rather deal with runny nose and cough than aggressive behavior and child of 3 say im scared.,Do not give to young child whi cannot express his feelings thru out.,,3,7  days,10/27/2015Email,Allegra

20, 2, Seasonal allergies,Chest pain_ pressure & tightness. Difficulty breathing. Changes in EKG,Allegra was very effective initially_ but efficacy lessened the longer I took it. Then ~ not knowing it was bad until after the fact ~ I was taking it while using acidic supplements I.e. vitamin C & Cranberry caps (for an unrelated health issue)  & I believe this is what spawned the cardiac problems {I read later it's not supposed to be taken with fruit juice.} The chest pain felt like classic heart attack symptoms & I went right to the Dr. My EKG is slightly different but the changes are not significant_ thank goodness. And once I stopped the Allegra & got a lot of rest_ the chest pain & dyspnea went away. *I also read later that fexofenadine / Allegra is a 2nd generation metabolite drug of terfenadine / Seldane that was taken off the market in 1998 for cardiac arrhythmias that caused sudden death.  An FYI & thanks to everyone who contributes to this site! A go-to for me from now on when I need to use a new med.,F,42,6  weeks 1X D,9/25/2015,Allegra
21, 1, Seasonal allergies,Weak legs_ horrible back pain_ dizziness_ stomach pain,Over 2 years ago I started having back pain to the point that I was bed ridden for almost a year. The Drs couldn't figure it out. I went through PT several times and different pain meds_ but nothing helped. A family member asked me if I was taking Allegra_ I was_ she told me to get off of it. I did and the pain got better. At least I could function again. Not too long ago_ I tried the 60 mg thinking it wouldn't be as strong. Within a few days_ my back was killing me and my legs were weak. I have thrown it all out. I will never take Allegra again. Nasty stuff!,F,48,1  months60 or 180,9/20/2015,Allegra
22, 1, seasonal allergies,I have seen multiple doctors_ done multiple tests_ and spent thousands of dollars trying to figure out what was wrong with my body. I thought is was MS_ or muscular dystrophy. I would get severe weakness in my legs_ and some trembling.  I had no physical strength in my body what so ever. It was very frustrating. And the doctors couldn't figure it out. Well_ I just figured it out. It s the Allergra. After 3 months of having no symptoms_ and then all of a sudden the symptoms have come back_ it has dawned on me that it is the Allegra that I just started taking again for my seasonal allergies that is causing it. This drug is not for everyone.  My son has no physical side effects like me_ but he gets very emotional on this medicine. And he is not a sensitive emotional kind of kid. I actually like that it brings out his emotional side. Benyadryl made him extremely angry and abusive. So I'll take sensitive and emotional over that.,,F,32,4  weeks30mg 1X D,9/17/2015,Allegra
23, 1, Allergies,At first drug seemed amazing stopped side effects of allergies about half an hour after taking it. However within a few days I started to feel different I itched_ and felt sad and stressed. I put this down to being 'hormonal' like every girl my age does. However I started to feel dread towards something unknown almost like depression that I had no way of explaining. My mum noticed a difference in me but again put it down to hormones. I then on my 21st day of taking it had horrible hand tremors that lasted around 12 hours to then wake up and have the most excruciating arm muscle pain when bending the elbow_ (This is today as I am writing) I started thinking the most horrible things were happening to me such as MS or some other devastating muscular disease. I know it sounds dramatic but is honestly started to diagnose myself. I am normally outgoing and always on the move however today is my third day of not leaving the house because I am so tired and weak legged. I decided to google the drug after I have been sitting here crying for twenty minutes for no apparent reason. And I found this site where 685 other people have had similar reactions. Feww_ I don't wish it upon anyone at all_ but I'm glad that I'm not alone in being an absolute mess when taking this.

28, 1, seasonal allergies,Dizziness_ stomach cramps_ extreme tiredness_ tingling and numbness in leg_ face_ and arm_ inability to concentrate_ headache_ paranoia,I used to take allegra on occasion for my allergies_ then at the start of summer I began taking it once daily. A few days after I started it gave me weird numbness and tingling all down my right leg_ but I didn't make the connection that it was the allegra. Then gradually over the last two months my symptoms have gotten more severe_ I became super anxious and paranoid and thought that I was seriously ill or diabetic_ and consequently was unable to fall sleep. Just a couple days ago I realized it must be the allegra because there were a brief few days I had forgotten to take it_ and I felt a lot better and didn't have the tingling in my face that had been happening a few times every day. I was still taking it after that time because once again I didn't make the connection to the allegra_ but now I have. It has been two days since I stopped taking it_ and while my symptoms haven't gone away entirely yet_ I do feel somewhat better.,F,26,2  months180 mg 1X D,7/25/2015,Allegra
29, 5, Chronic Uticaria,None! Great pill to take!,I used to take Minocyclin in an effort to rid of my severe body acne. That didn't work and left me with nonstop hives less than a month after taking it. Even when I stopped taking Minocyclin my hives were uncontrollable. I never had hives before that pill. The hives were so bad I would have to go to the ER and urgent cares. They would wake me up in the middle of the night_ would appear everywhere on my body and face_ and make me feel like ants were crawling under my skin. Absolutely terrible.Because my condition was so severe_ several doctors put me on steroids_ which none worked. I went to an allergist_ and she told me I was allergic to several insects_ foods_ and plants_ but through a blood test taken in 2015 I found out that was false. Anyways_ after the steroid dosages I was prescribed Allegra. That's how long I've been taking it_ back in the day when it wasn't available over-the-counter. Personally_ I felt that Allegra when it was prescribed was stronger. However_ the over-the-counter 180mg dosage is great too. I take it only when I break out in hives_ which isn't every day but maybe 2-3 times a week.I regret taking that darn acne pill_ but life happens. Allegra has helped me get through many things with no side effects. I wish you all the best with this pill_ don't be discouraged to try it!,F,20,6  years189,7/24/2015Email,Allegra

My head feels a little funny like when your nose is stopped up but not as terrible. The sensation makes me feel a little loopy. I hope the nose thing goes away as I go back to smaller doses.,Like many commenters I've been irritable and crying but I really think it's because I'm covered in ugly burning itching hives and there's a fairly good chance they'll never figure out why and I could be like this for 20 or more years.

He said this feeling would not go away and he had no reason to feel sad(he is a great student_ has many friends and is very social  and has a pleasant personality). We took him back to his pediatrician and she stopped his Allegra immediately. It has now been two weeks since and he is fine now.

45, 1, yes,This is a horrible medication.  I have been taking Walmart brand fexofenadine for sinus issues.  I worked initially to dry up my sinuses and post nasal drip.  However_ after about 2 weeks I started having heart palpitations_ tremors_ panic attacks_ pain in lower back_ trembling in left leg.  I went to the ER twice.  Was given a clean bill of health (and of course a High medical bill will be coming in the mail.).  I started thinking the most horrible things were happening to me such as ALS_ MS or some other devastating muscular_ or cardiac degenerative disease.  I started eliminating all vitamins_ asthma medication except for Fexofenadine.  I kept on taking that and the symptoms persist.  I finally figured out what was happening to me.

51, 1, Indoor/outdoor allergies,Anxiety. Depression.,"First of all_ let me address those who are criticizing people's experiences and calling them ""hypochondriacs."" And let me offer a well deserved rebuttal for these critical and close-minded individuals who see it fit to parade their uninformed_ unstudied opinions around. People react to medications differently_ individually. This is a thread to educate_ to communicate. Not to tear down. My experience on Allegra is very much like the experiences I have read on server all different websites. During the four weeks that I was on this medication_ I began to experience extreme anxiety and depression for absolutely no reason. I have a fine job. All of my relationships are healthy. It occurred to me to search the web for any sort of correlation between Allegra and anxiety/depression and I found multiple webpages and threads that exposed these sort of symptoms. For those of you claiming that prior experience with depression/anxiety or hypochondria are the real culprits--this is completely untrue. I am a high energy_ charismatic person and have never had any trouble with anxiety or depression. Allegra caused me to feel completely numb_ unable to find any source of joy and crying due to a sense of doom and hopelessness. I didn't want anything to do with my friends. I was completely inconsolable. The side effects of this drug are very real. I've stopped taking it and after two days I'm beginning to feel like myself again. Everyone around me has noticed a difference. We need to b",F,25,4  weeks1 xD,3/27/2015,Allegra

I have never felt so miserable nor have I ever been so scared! After 4 doses_ I realized it was the Allegra and stopped taking it. It's been almost a week and I'm still not completely back to normal but I am feeling so much better.

57, 1, Hives,I first took Allegra (180mg) one morning before a fall festival where it was going to be windy_ and it worked great with no side effects. Ten days ago I developed a slowly spreading rash and doc said I could try Allegra. This time I took it at 7 in the evening. At 1am I woke up with upset stomach and bloating and severe dry mouth. I drank water for two hours with some relief. I do have chronic digestive issues and recurrent dry mouth_ so my take is that Allegra 180mg is just too strong for me and not suitable for nighttime use (when laying prone).,,F,44,1  days180MG,3/3/2015,Allegra
58, 2, Asthma and Bad Allergies,Extreme Anxiety_ Hyperactivity_ Nervousness_ Fatigue but wired.  Personality changes_ mood swings.,This is the first time I tried the real brand name Allegra_ before I had only tried the generic.  This drug is horrible.  It did work on my allergy symptoms pretty well_ but the severe anxiety and other side effects are not worth it.  If I dare to take more than 30mg a day_ it's like someone gave me ten lines of cocaine and I'm wired and jacked up like crazy.  Extreme Anxiety and Hyperactivity.  And all kinds of manic and not feeling myself.  And very fatigued_ but wired up.  I'm not the only one who has gotten all this off Allegra_ if you search google_ you will find many people going back over ten years who got all this from Allegra.  It's a terrible drug that never should have been approved.  It shouldn't be given to children_ and it should only be used in very small amounts in the most extreme allergy attack situations and even then_ it's not worth it.,F,45,1  days30mg 2X D,2/11/2015Email,Allegra

It cleared up my asthma and I had no allergy symptoms_ but I had a migraine and nausea.  And when I took the second pill_ I got severe racing heart for two hours.  So for the next dose_ I cut it in half to 30mg.  And then found on the third day_ I got all kinds of side effects from stomach bloating to actual headcold and fluish symptoms with very dry cough and my asthma came back in full force with a severe attack.  It's a weird drug that I wouldn't take again.  This was the generic.  Still coughing as I write this.  And Wikipedia says it has caused real flu and cold symptoms during trials.

All side effects went away within 3 days.  I'll never take Allegra again.  Two other antihistamines have similar side effects with me - Xyzal and Benadryl.

I knew that the only new thing in her life was the Allegra. I found so many other parents on blogs that say the same thing about their children. How is this stuff even legal to take if it makes you that crazy!

69, 1, Hay Fever,I took fexofenadine 180mg for 3 days. The first day I took it in the morning and felt very weird_ a bit off balanced when walking_ and lack of strength. Then I took it at night for 2 days_ and my stomach felt as if it was full of air and very blown up_ followed by constipation_ even though I was on salad. I couldn't figure out why until tonight. So I have decided to go back to Chlorphenamine maleate 4 mg (to be honest_ nothing really works 100% during the high pollen season).

I could barely stand it! So for about a year I stopped taking it all together I still had allergies but the symptoms weren't as severe.  However_ recently I thought I would give it another try. I didn't want an unopened bottle of it to go to waste.  However_ I had the same reaction as before.  For weeks my allergy symptoms got worse.  It was horrible! I didn't want to do anything.

It cleared up my allergies_ I breathed more clearly...but after one month I noticed I am tumbling into depression.  I couldnt put my finger on it.  I tried to think what I was doing differently and realized it was the Allegra.  I won't be taking anymore.  On the way home from church today (I left early which I never do) I wondered if I should check myself into the hospital.

I am an out door runner so I am sure that isn't helping matters. My doctor suggest I try allegra thinking perhaps I had built up a tolerance to zytec.  Here I am a week later and dizzy with a face that feels like ants are under my skin_ dizziness is something that has never happen to me before_ let alone this creepy itchy face feeling. This all happen after doing insanitiy workout the cardio portion early this morning_ by the end I was so lightheaded that I fell to the floor. After seeing the other post on the sight I am feeling pretty secure in my gut instinct that this is caused by Allegra. Thank you to everyone who took the time to post their symptoms.

110, 2, Asthma Allergies,Extreme anxiety and panic attacks_  insomnia_ disturbing dreams_  depression,My 15 yr old daughter was put on Allegra last year by her allergist after Zyrtec didn't seem effective any longer. She has severe allergies and her asthma was getting worse. The anxiety started soon after but we attributed it to stress due to her asthma. The past year has seen her anxiety climb to nearly daily panic attacks and an inability to function. We put her in therapy and he recommended we see a psychiatrist for anti-anxiety meds. I took her first to her pediatrician who mentioned that Allergra was linked to anxiety and we should try changing her antihistamine first. I switched her to Claritan the same night. That was a week ago and she is sleeping through the night for the first time in months. Her mood has stabilized some and she is definately calmer. I only hope she continues to return to the outgoing carefree kid she was last year. The allergist should have warned us about these potential side effects.,F,15,13  months180MG 1X D,5/13/2013Email,Allegra

I was terrified and completely stuck in this dream state. I felt terrified the whole time and felt as if I were blacking out. now my bf and I are afraid for me to fall back asleep bc if he does not wake me up again I do not know what will happen. I could not catch my breath and do not want to feel that scared again. if anyone else has had a similar experience_ PLEASE contact me. maybe I drank too much soda or smoked too many cigarettes before bed? I'd like to compare experiences and see if there are any other connections. I need to take allergy medication because my symptoms are that severe and I do not know what else to taken.

114, 1, Bad Seasonal Allergies,The first night I had a horrible surreal feeling_ like I was about to leave my body.  The second night I felt the same feeling_ then all the muscles in my body felt like they had been tensed up and released_ very sore_ then triggered a severe anxiety attack and also triggered my SVT.  I ended up in the ER and they said it was SVT_ but I didn't link the Allegra at this point.  The third day I had a severe increase in blood pressure and severe anxiety attack.  The attack wore off and I had a hard time falling asleep.  Just as I was about to fall asleep I felt a jerk in my leg then broke out into uncontrollable chills.  I tried to sit next to a space heater to warm up to no avail.  My body finally calmed down after about 30 minutes.

I will not use the Allegra with decongestant because that stuff makes me dizzy.  If I need a decongestant_ I take Mucinex.  I am surprised to see people posting anxiety as a side effect.  I suffer from anxiety and had not correlated my increase in anxiety to the use of Allegra during the past few weeks.  This is a good product if you don't need to take an antihistamine every day.

The prednisone worked the best as my problem is inflammation getting out of control_ but one doesn't want to just be on steroids every spring.  Allegra is second-best by a long shot.  I just know (this is my second year on 24-hour Allegra) that once I start the Allegra I have very vivid and intense dreams every night.  I take the pill before bed so I can wake up with plenty in my bloodstream_ which might have something to do with it.  I have a family and personal history of anxiety and depression as well that has been successfully managed without medication for the last couple of years.

I used Claritin for years and it was only mildly effective_ very few side effects but it seemed to be working less and less.  Zyrtec stopped my allergies but made me completely unable to function I was so drowsy.  Allegra didn't make me drowsy until after I slept (taking the 24 hour pill in the afternoon)_ I found it much harder than usual to get up and my head felt like lead in the mornings.  Over just the past 5 days it seems to have started to be less effective already (I sneezed quite a lot and had a mild throat/nose/eye itchiness even when using Allegra after the first 2 times).  Then today I had the worst migraine that lasted so long_ accompanied by general malaise and my eyes feel like I haven't slept in 6 months.

When first I realized my legs felt extremely restless and there was an increase in twitching post-anxiety (the other symptoms began shortly thereafter) my *immediate* thought was_ ""Gee_ this is exactly how I began feeling when I started taking Fluoxetine..."" I should have RIGHT then and there researched into Allegra; I could have saved myself from a TON of worrying. Though under unfortunate circumstances_ seeing similar self-reported side effects makes me feel SO much better- I was scared I was going insane or suffering from a terrible neurological condition.

I bought the named brand allegra and had an awful response.  After 2 days of the pill_ I was awoken at night with heart fluttering.  I could not return to sleep.  Gas in the chest soon accompanied the fluttering.  Anxiety and insomnia shortly ensued from the fear of kicking the bucket due to the heart fluttering.  When I called up the company they said that while the active ingredient (fexafenodine) is the same_ the inactive ingredients are not uniform across the board.  So perhaps something in the inactive composition caused this awful effect.,M,38,10  years180 1X D,10/6/2011,Allegra
178, 2, reduce congestion_ especially lung,Itching! Whole body felt like it was crawling with little bugs_ worst on days I skipped Allegra_ but I had NO itching before. Sleeplessness_ occasional dizziness_ increased anxiety_ some loss of motivation / depression_ heartburn for only the 2nd or 3rd time in my life.,All of my symptoms as well as most of those reported here (including night terror / restless legs) are common symptoms of yeast overgrowth (candida albicans). I am prone to this and have had it in balance for years with diet and probiotics. It seems as though Allegra has destroyed that balance and allowed the yeast to again multiply out of control_ which would explain why for me and many others the itching is worst when stopping. It is caused by yeast_ but suppressed by Allegra while on it. Once you're off_ the yeast are still there_ but no suppression.As yeast infections are not common (especially in men)_ most people can probably take Allegra without side effects_ but for those of us prone to yeast_ whoa!

If I came in contact with molds or some types of lotion_ I would break out in a rash. I was miserable!So_ they started me off on Claritin_ the type you dissolve on your tongue. All that did was make me so drowsy that I would want to sleep all day. They moved me up to ClaritinD and that actually worked for about a month before my body built up a tolerance. Finally_ they prescribed me 180mg of Allegra. This little peach-colored pill was aMAZING.Here is my experience with Allegra. As long as I remember to take it once a day_ usually in the morning and never with orange juice_ I usually begin to feel relief from my allrgies within an hour. This is the best result I have gotten from any OTC medication that was not cold medication.

213, 3, Year-round allergies,headaches (ranges from minor throbs to nasty migraines)_ nausea_ dizziness_ mood swings,My allergist used to prescribe Allegra for me_ but I had stopped taking it 5 years ago after I stopped getting my allergy shots. Since then_ I have been on over-the-counter Claritin and Zyrtec. When Allegra was approved for over-the-counter_ I ran right out to my drug store and bought a 30-count bottle. Big mistake and waste of money. I have only been taking it for 4 days so far and I have gotten constant headaches_ nausea_ and dizziness. At first_ I chalked it up to stress. And then I realized I have only been experiencing these symptoms in the past 3-4 days after I started taking Allegra again. In addition to all the side effects_ Allegra also doesn't provide instant relief--it takes about an hour before my allergy symptoms stop bothering me.,F,27,4  days180mg 1X D,5/13/2011Email,Allegra

I had been miserable for so long it is still hard for me to believe that this is actually working and I feel good!

217, 1, Seasonal allergies,severe ear pressure and 50% reduction in hearing,My ears began to feel as though they were filled with fluid causing great pressure to my inner ears just shortly after starting Allegra. I did not make the connection until today. Reading the allegra side effects on the web and this site helped me make the connection. Really funny part - went to an ear specialist 5 days ago. He saw no physical change in my ears_ deducted that it must be a sinus infection_ presribed antibiotics and stepped me up to allegra D. Now I'm deaf and dizzy.  When I reported that the symptoms began just shortly after starting allegra - don't you think that might have been a red flag for a trained doc?  So tired of having to rely on own senses and internet for survival. Hope I'm never in serious need of medical help.  It's a total crap shoot out there.,F,56,2  months 1X D,5/7/2011Email,Allegra

From light sniffling_ within an hour of taking Allegra_ I would begin sneezing non-stop and feel totally itchy!!! My nose would itch_ eyes itch_ and my overall face felt completely swollen!!! I took this a few times_ thinking it was just a fluke or coincidence. NOPE! I tried Citirizine the other day_ and felt better afterward.

I do not overeat and I am not on a diet. Weight gain all in the stomach and back / I've never had that in my life. The anxiety became disabling. I went to a neurologist to rule out any reason for my shaking/trembling...uncontrollable - looked like I had Parkinsons' but all tests (I had many including a spinal tap - ct scans and x-rays) cam out normal/negative.  I felt depressed and would cry when alone (I've always been a cheerful person).  The dreams were not only vivid_ but terrifying. When I woke I felt exhausted_ not rested. After taking the pill (before bed) it acted like a sleep med and I fell asleep wherever I was at the time/not necessarily in bed (difficult).  My heart would pound so much at times that I felt it was some sort of anxiety attack - but there was no anxiety I could pinpoint (I've never had an anxiety attack).  Just horrible. Joint pain started in the last month of the drug. Back pain so back I could not stand. - I stopped the drug last month.  I'm fine now without any of these symptoms that continued for the previous year.

Er dr told me I was stressed & sent me home.  Original Dr had to give me a shot to lower my heart rate (the next day) I went through this heart rate all night at home.  Figured why go to ER if they thought I was stressed & werent going to do anything unless I stroked out or had heart failure.  Then the DR did tests on my heart.  (I originally went in for my head!) After 6 months Dr told me I was fine.  By then I was on Paxil_ still panicky & still had the original dizziness they never figured out.  Got a NEW Dr.  Took me off Paxil and gave me ativan for as needed use.  Still have panic attacks regularly.  They told me when the medicine cleared my system I would be fine. THIS HAS BEEN 6 YEARS.

I took Allegra for one week and felt like I was having a heart attack one morning (I was 22 years old). I went to see my doctor and he said that my heart was perfectly fine. Every doctor in his office told me that Allegra does not cause heart palpitations. I stopped taking Allegra for one year and have not had a single heart palpitation since. I recently began taking Allegra again and have had heart palpitations on several different occasions_ including one palpitation episode that woke me up in the middle of the night. Two different doctors (one is an allergy specialist) have since told me that Allegra does not cause heart palpitations or irregular heart rates. I beg to differ.,F,23, ,6/13/2009,Allegra

I can't believe I have found something that actually dries my nose and clears it and especially clears my eyes which usually swell because of allergies.  This stuff is awesome.  I am so glad I tried it and highly recommend it.  I have had NO negative side effects at all from it.  It is a miracle drug for me.

I was always loggy and tired in the morning_ into the early afternoon.,I went off all drugs after I saw a new allergist who did new food testing to find I was allergic to wheat_ yeast_ sesame_ potatoes_ bananas_ tuna_ white grapes (wine)_ and peanuts. I felt much_ much better_ more energy_ focus and less stomach issues. I now have to take another antihistamine_ but only take 1/2 of a Zyzal at bedtime. More than a 1/2 and I'm a zombie in the A.M.  If I'm desperate and really allergic or if I've cheated badly on my diet_ I take 1/2 of a Loratadine. It's not great but is keeping the sinusitis in check.,F,55,6  months,5/26/2009,Allegra

Figured my irritability was just because of the headaches and neck and back pain_ but maybe not. It definitely does leave me a bit foggy_ mentally (not nearly as bad as Zyrtec_ benadryl_ etc.). It does seem to make tinitis a bit worse. Have had to take antihistamines all my life and this one_ especially the old capsule Brand form_ seemed the best of the evils. Maybe my tolerance for drugs is decreasing.,"Except for the heart arrhythmias (etc.) with Seldane (precurser to Allegra)_ it was the best antihisamine but allegra works fairly well on my hayfever_ etc. It lets me go outside--a good thing!!   Claritin causes VERY bad tinitus in me as well as general ""yucky"" feeling. Zyrtec really zonks me out. Good old chlorpheniramine works fairly well but leaves me a bit ""dopey"".

But the constant backache was unacceptable.  Note: I only found this was caused by the Allegra by browsing in the Physician's Desk Reference at the library.  This side effect was not on the pharmacy handout. I thought Allegra might be doing something weird because it gives the same instructions as Cipro regarding fruit juices and antacids_ and Cipro did a real job on me in 2004.  The backache went away over a period of several days after stopping the Allegra.  However_ my urine stills smells peculiar and I wonder if the Allegra was causing the backache via kidney damage.

That was probably the pseudephrine- if I take a 12 hour Sudafed along with the Allegra I feel a little wired_ but not nearly as bad. It's less of a distraction than being congested. I don't feel that way when I take the Allegra by itself. Before I started taking it_ I was having constant sinus congestion_ and frequent asthma symptoms (mainly chest tightness/pressure and an awful sounding cough)_ which I had not had with my allergies previously. Several members of my family have adult-onset asthma_ and that's what I thought it was.

I can't stand the hives either--they cover every inch of my body and it's unbearable. I did notice the pill bottle does say ""drink with plenty of water."" Will try to up my water intake to see if that has an impact. Otherwise_ I may try claritin again and see if the side effects go away.",F,32,7  months,1/2/2009,Allegra

I used to take Claritin and it made me feel terrible (decreased appetite_ nervous energy_ irritability_ more prone to anger and depression).  I imagine it is what speed feels like.  I had none of theses symptoms with Allegra_ which does not have psuedo-ephedrine liek Claritan-D and Allegra-D.

The coroner expressed interest that she had been taking Allegra at the time_ but said nothing.

I came to this website before I started taking Allegra so I kind of knew what I might be in for_ but I wanted to try it anyway just in case it actually DID do something for me.  I have issues with depression and anxiety to begin with_ and this drug only magnified those problems.  I'd go from yelling at someone one minute to bawling the next.  I also had a lot of aches & pains that were different than the normal ones I am familiar with.  I told the Dr. this stuff is horrid_ now he's going to try me on Zyrtec instead_ but from what I've read on here about the side effects of that_ they are even worse than Allegra.My advice is if you start taking this medication and all of a sudden feel extremely depressed or angry_ STOP taking it!,F,41,2  weeks,11/8/2007,Allegra

For the last two weeks I've had nausea_ abdominal pain_ and bowel problems similar to IBS. I though it was just a stomach flu_ but after looking at what others have said here_ I'm going to go off the pills for a few days and see if that clears it up. Allegra has helped my congestion_ but not done much for my post-nasal drip_ and it's really not worth it to keep taking it if it's giving me all these side effects.,F,19,1  months,9/24/2007,Allegra

In March of this year I devloped Hives. I'll get a spot that itches and I scratch and then the hives appear for about 10 min then go away. Allegra does NOT help this at ALL. As a matter of fact Allegra is not helping with my other allergies anymore either. I went to the Allergy Doc and he couldn't find anything that could cause these hives but he did switch my meds to Zyrtec D...which I have been taking for a about 3 weeks and I feel like a normal person again and my hives are none exsistant.

However after getting a new dog a few weeks ago_ whose dander activates my allergies worse than any other dog I've had_ I needed to start taking Allegra again (generic this time) and have been a bit disappointed. It has done wonders for my itchy eyes_ nasal congestion_ and frequent itching/burning throat_ but the side-effects are much worse than those of the brand-name pills.

It also made me depressed_ and during previous years_ I couln't tell what it was and was freaking out; I thought my other meds stopped working.

550, 3, seasonal allergies,severe depression - feel like crying; extreme sleepiness/tiredness (take meds in the morning); more severe menstral cramps and changed menstral schedule,I have been severely depressed lately_ so did a google search to see if it might be a side effect of taking Allegra and discovered this forum in which some people have noted this. Also_ after reading here about menstral cramps and changed menstral schedules_ I have to say that has occurred in me too_ but I thought it might just be because of my age.  As for being tired_ I typically wake at 4:30am to walk and go to bed about 10pm; but lately have been trying to get to bed by 9 (and am actually sleepy around 7:00) and am sleeping in.  I thought maybe the depression was making my tired. I have used Allegra for Spring allergies for about 4 or 5 years now.  2006 has been the 1st year I've needed it for Fall allergies.  I live in Austin TX - major allergy city. Note_ I do not take Allegra year round - only as needed_ so time taking drug applies to this Fall only,F,44,2  months,10/11/2006,Allegra

Mild side effect...Okay_ but symptoms such as the ones that my son expereienced...hell no.

I'd forgotten that caveat until now.The good news is that Allegra virtually elliminated all the repeated and often violent sneezing_ congestion_ sore nostrils and sinus symptoms within 12 hours. I'd suffered the symptoms for 7 weeks. I'd tried antibiotocs_ even went to a hospital for chest x-rays concerned that after so long_ I might be coming down with pneumonia. Prior to Allegra_ the inflation of my nostrils was such that I was unable to use the nostril pillow used with my Cepac. Tonight for the first time in weeks_ I was able to.

I took it for three days before noticing side effects_ but once they started_ I was miserable_ not to mention frightened since no doctor had told me that any of these were possible side effects of this drug. I am very prone to anxiety and had a lot of anxiety attacks which were probably due to all my scary inexplicable symptoms but also might've had something to do with the medication itself. I also had a strange feeling in my diaphragm_ as if I couldn't draw a full breath.I have to take something year-round because I'm allergic to my rat and get sinus infections if I don't stay medicated.

My doctor switched me to Allegra 180_ but I can't seem to shake the anxiousness & heart palpitations.

620, 2, allergies,Depression_ stomach cramping_ gastrointestinal distress symptoms_ backaches_ headaches; developed hives AFTER I stopped taking Allegra,I had my tonsils removed in Dec '04_ and by the time I healed_ I noticed I had severe post-nasal drip that I never seemed to have before. I asked my ear-nose-throat doctor about it and she insisted I be tested for allergies.  I found out I'm very allergic to all weeds_ grasses_ trees_ dust_ molds_ basically everything but animals. However_ my ONLY allergy symptom was post-nasal drip_ which I still to this day suspect had more to do with healing after the tonsillectomy. This is where the run-around started... I was told to try Claritin_ which made me extrememly depressed AND I had such terrible symptoms that I thought I was pregnant and had IBS.  Next_ I was given Allegra samples. They reduced my PND somewhat_ so I thought it was the best option at the time.  Then I was given Zyrtec samples for comparison. They only worked as well as the Allegra_ but made me too sleepy to function at work. So the doctor convinced me to fill an Allegra prescription.  I paid all this money (even WITH insurance) and took 28 pills (one every morning) before I realized that it gave me way too many bad side effects to make it worth my while.  Now I have $100 worth of useless Allegra pills_ AND I have developed hives since I stopped taking them. I get hives about four or five times a week now_ never had them before.  I tried Benadryl_ it made me too tired.  I tried guaifenesin_ made the PND worse.

However_ when I took Allegra alone last year_ I believe the side effects I experienced were headache and dry mouth,I have severe seasonal and indoor allergies_ I get 2-3 sinus infections per year - this med has helped my allergies a great deal and prevented my sinus infections!  For people whose allergies are bad enough to take it every day and who don't have severe indoor allergies_ I recommend not taking it during the winter.  It's effects and helpfulness can decrease taking it year-round.  WAY better than that weak Claritin.,F,16,3  years,6/28/2005,Allegra
