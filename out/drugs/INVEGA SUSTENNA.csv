0, 1, Forced in Hospital,Blurred vision_ painful acne_ joint and foot pain_ akathisia_ heart arrhythmia and elevated rate. Muscle pain and weakness_ major weight gain +40 lbs.  Sexual dysfunction. Loss of motivation_ fatigue_ anhedonia_ major depression_ suicidal thoughts. All of these problems except for akathisia and arrythmia are persisting 5 months after last injection.,Doctors are giving this seriously powerful drug out like candy to people that have no business being on it. If you're not seriously psychotic and this shot is given to you_ you WILL suffer worse than ever before. There is no relief either_ as the dopamine receptors blocked by it are responsible for how the human brain and body responds to ALL OTHER DRUGS. They either won't work or the effects will be drastically altered.  The drug will linger in your body for a year+ if given a high dosage. It should be a crime to produce a drug that lasts this long_ anyone that has problems with it is in trouble for a long time. A mental prison sentence until it evacuates and may even take longer to recover since the receptors are so messed up. Unbelievable_ really.,M,35,1  weeks390 mg,8/2/2016,Invega sustenna

10, 2, Schitzo-affective Disorder / Depression,"Exhaustion to the point of not being able to handle daily responsibilities. I would go a week or so and then have another 3-4 day spell where I was so tired I had to hold on to the wall to go to the rest room_ catatonic sleeping for days on end.. My bp down 72/40.

Complete careless/while hopeless outlook_ weight gain. No sex drive. Don't care if I'm homeless_... makes me want to give up and get SSI if I have to do this forever. No joy_ no anxiety_ no anything... just tired. One day period.",I swear_ I have the same side effects. This is truly outrageous. I was told I had to take this shot or never see my toddler again_ so I agreed even though anti-psycs always make me tired. My bp down 72/40. Doc said it was interacting with Suboxone... until I found this site. Always wanting to put me in withdrawal. My halucs/delus did get much better though and I have started to feel better just a few days past my missed dose. Sex drive and period coming back almost immediately_ as with the psychosis. :(   And this is one of the few medications that I was able to decrease my Sub dose instead of tripling it.,F,36,45  days234 1X M,1/2/2016Email,Invega sustenna

30, 3, bipolar,This drug is a break through in delivery medicine.  Sustenna replaced my Consta Shots.,I only have to take one shot a month.  Thats equivalent to 30 or more pills a month.  There talking about delivering the medicince through an inhaler.  I don't think it's in testing for Sustenna_ but I read articles about Consta being distributed through inhaling the medicine versus injecting into your arm.  The side effects are not fun for the medicine and I hope to not take it much longer.  After taking this medicine_ there sometimes feels like there is no alternative.  The injections are sometimes sacry_ but i'm use to them from being on Consta.  I some times feel desperate and alone because this drug takes away all your feel good emotions.,F,27,6  months117mg 1X M,8/23/2011,Invega sustenna
