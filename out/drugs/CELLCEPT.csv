12, 4, Primary SjoÌˆgren's Syndrome-systemic,This is the third DMARD I have tried after Plaquenil and injectable Methotrexate. I asked my rheumatologist if I could try CellCept next because my condition has a lot of features of lupus_ and this medicine seems to be effective for many patients with sle. My disease was controlling my life prior to starting this medication. I was very depressed and always felt awful. I'm beginning to feel subtle improvements_ such as having more energy. I've never responded this way to any of the other treatments I've tried_ so I'm feeling very positive about making this choice. So far my labs are great and the only side effect might be a bit of nausea. I would recommend this medicine to anyone who has an autoimmune disease that is not under control.,,F,26,1  months500 mg x 2,12/22/2013,Cellcept

22, 5, To help me get off of Prednisone,Fatigue in the beginning,My original post was on 6/26/10 when I'd been on Cellcept (Mycophenalate) for 3 weeks. I was prescribed Prednisone in Nov. 2008 for Bullous Pemphigoid and had several attempts at weaning off of the steroids without success.  Finally success....I took my last Pred. on 11/20/10_ thanks to this drug!  I've been slowly tapering off of the Cellcept since Jan. 1 and am now taking 1 Cellcept every other day......April 9th will be my last one.  I am optimistic that the BP is now in long term remission and I can put all of this behind me finally!,F,73,9  months250 mg. 1X D,3/25/2011Email,Cellcept
23, 5, Behcet's Disease,Obviously I am now more susceptible to secondary infections_ since this is an immunosuppressant.Also_ diarrhea - worse with higher dosage.,I have previously tried several different immunosuppression medications (ie Imuran_ Trental)_ and found CellCept not only to be the most helpful (reduced major flares requiring weeks in the hospital from every ~7 months to every ~2 years)_ but also had the fewest and most tolerable side effects of anything else I've tried.,F,32,3  years1.5G 2X D,1/17/2011,Cellcept
24, 4, Lupus Low Platelets,I started a low platelet (7) flare 11 months ago and Predniose 80mg & 750 to get count up to 40 then 20mg tired to taper steroids and then platelets drop to back to 40 platlets so back to 130 and trying to taper 2mg every two weeks. I keep asking if the cellcept is causing a new area for flares.,Have noticed an increasein flourscent light(WalMart Boxstores) get wonderful splitting headache. Pamelor helped with migraines and sleep deepth. Any ideas for keep platlet counts up to normal? Could it be the Cellcept? Or just a new chapter in Lupus,F,45,11  months1000 mg 1X D,8/25/2010Email,Cellcept
25, 4, Bullous Pemphigoid,Fatigue,I've only been on Cellcept for 3 weeks today so it could be a bit early for my evaluation.  Nevertheless my Dr. put me on it in an effort to get me off of the Prednisone_ which I've been on for 19 months.  I've already been on Dapsone for over 3 months and did not help at all....actually I was getting worse while taking it.  Then we tried Imuran which was working fantastic with my Prednisone taper but was causing some potentially serious side effects.  The Cellcept is helping me with my taper_ maybe not quite as good as the Imuran but I am hopeful that this will be the drug that helps me get off the Pred!  In just 3 weeks I've discovered that if you don't follow the directions about 2 hours after or 1 hour before a meal it makes a difference with the drug absorption in your system.  I messed up with that twice in a 2 day period and started having problems....now I am paying close attention to taking it on an empty stomach and am doing well.,F,72,3  weeks500 mg. 2X D,6/26/2010Email,Cellcept
26, 5, lupus,,I also wanted to comment that I used to get upper respiratory infections (URI) 3 to 4 times a year that took forever to clear up in the five years I suffered before taking Cellcept.  In the five years since I started taking Cellcept_ I have had only 3 URIs_ only one was really bad that required a trip to the doctor's office.  If you have not responded to other drug therapies_ TRY tHIS medication.,F,53,5  years1000 mg 2X D,6/9/2010,Cellcept
27, 5, lupus,nausea nausea nausea,After five years of wishing I wouldn't wake up every morning_ I began to take Cellcept (CC).  After three months of taking CC_ I had lost 25 lbs. and was eating way more than before taking CC.  I can inhale deeply without pain_ I can eat without running to the bathroom five or six times  WITHIN 30 minutes after eating_ I can touch rough objects without cringing_ I can tolerate direct sunlight and my skin looks/feels better_ my fatigue has decreased 90%. i can think clearER_limited fog now_ my oral hygiene problems are improved_ my visual and hearing disturbances are much improved.  While I still have problems_ the quality of my life is tolerable. CC made a tremendous positive difference in my life.  I wish more physicians were knowledgeable about the benefits of this medication.  I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from autoimmune disorders who has not responded to otherdrug therapies.  I seriously just wanted to die.  Now I don't.It is expensive even in its generic form.  What will I do when I am older and don't have the insurance coverage I have now.  I have taken medication vacations_ but I always go back on it.  I need it.  CC gave me the ability to enjoy life again.  i laugh now. :-) I was unable to say that five years ago.  tRY IT.,F,53,5  years1000 mg 2X D,6/5/2010,Cellcept
28, 2, SLE,This medication lowers your immune system_ so I was exposed to more illnesses. I had bronchitis three times of the first 2 months of being on the medication. Can't sleep at night_ tired during the day. On 2000 mg dose.,I'm on the fence. I don't know if the side effects are coming from this medication or a mixture of all my other medications. I hate polypharmacy! ugh!,F,21,8  months,6/21/2009,Cellcept
29, 5, Lupus Nephritis,Aside from being very tired_ which could be related to a lupus flare - this medication seems to have been successful.,I was severely leaking protien.  After about 6-8 months on Cellcept I had significantly reduce protien leak and have been off the drug for approx 5 years and have not had another flare.  It seems that Cellcept really helped me.  Well worth being very tired for a few months!,M,43,6  months,2/9/2009,Cellcept
30, 5, Lupus Nephritis - SLE,Nausea_ dizziness,After four months of intravenous chemotherapy with cytoxan - I was put on Cellcept_ which is considered a milder type of chemotherapy. At the beginning i experienced some nausea and dizziness_ but other than that I'd say I had no other side effects. It gave me great results and I'd recommend it to anyone. My lupus was at bay during the duration of my treatment with cellcept_ and did not come back until two years after I was taken off of it. I am now trying Imuran_ and i am expericing what I think are stronger side effects.. Am thinking of asking my doctor to put me back on cellcept...,F,29,2.5  years,10/27/2008,Cellcept
31, 3, Myasthenia Gravis,I can't pinpoint any side effects.,In my case this has been a very trouble free drug.  Previously I was on prednisone_ which controlled my MG much better.  However_ cost of this drug is really prohibitive.  I could never afford this drug without good insurance coverage and I certainly won't be able to afford it after retirement.  Then what?,F,59,7  years,3/17/2008Email,Cellcept
32, 4, Lupus (SLE),Not many. Makes me a little tired_ so I take it at night. Recently_ I've had increased acne_ not sure why.,After trying a number of immunosuppresants and steroids_ Cellcept seemed to be the only one that didn't make me nauseous. (Although when my doc tried to increase the dose_ I got sick again_ so we lowered it back to one pill per day with no problems.) Also seems to be doing a good job keeping my lupus from flaring.,F,28,18  months,10/6/2007Email,Cellcept
33, 3, autoimmune uveitis -pars planitis,skin rash_ fatigue.,cellcept was the second immunosuppressant drug i tried after methotrexate. i was happy to have fewer side effects_ but i still had regular flair ups.  i still required periodic steroid injections and prednisone.  not the drug for me.  now i must move on to the more toxic substances.,F,32,450  days,8/15/2007,Cellcept

36, 4, Systemic Lupus,discoloration in fingernails_ but no severe effects experienced,This drug was much better than Imuran in controlling my Lupus flares. My illness had gotten so bad to the point that my hands  (perhaps as a result of Raynaud's condition?)_ arms_ and face were covered with deep painful rashes. My fingers also broke easily. Within the first month of taking Cellcept (as it has replaced Imuran) my fingernails started getting back to normal_ and the rashes stabilized.,F,24,4  years,2/23/2007,Cellcept
