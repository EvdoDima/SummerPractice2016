1, 5, Depression,Increased appetite_ strong constipation_ maybe dry mouth (could also come from other drugs I take_ noritren and lithium),"After 3 depressions in 6 years and trying Mirtazapin_ Lexapro_ Noritren_ Valdoxan_ Abilify and others_ it finally feels like I have found the right drug. As others have stated: You have not tried a real antidepressant before you have tried a MAOi like Marplan_ Parnate or Nardil. And for Marplan I can say_ dont trust all the hype about SE_ they are not stronger or more troublesome than for the newer SSRI and SNRI drugs_ at least not for me. And the food-ban list is not necessary to follow that strict if you just dont overdo it. I drink 3 glasses of red wine_ eat lots of grapes_ pizza - also with peperoni on it_ I use normal nosedrops. The real concern is really old things like old cheese_ old redwine and again a little will propably not harm_ it is the amount as I understand and experience it. Give this drug a try - and maybe not as choice number 6 as I did - there is really nothing to be afraid about despite all the hype about the ""dangerous"" MAOi's. Too many people are trying too many - almost similar - drugs with no or little result before going this way IMHO.",M,42,12  months40 mg 1X D,4/8/2014Email,Marplan
2, 1, bipolar depression,gained 80 lbs didn't work for 2 months became manic big time then just went into a very bad depression 3 months of depression_anxiety headcheadaches insomnia confusion getting off am doing much better.,this drug is either really bad or really good,F,50,9  months25mg 2X D,5/23/2010,Marplan
3, 5, Depression (bipolar),Loss of Appetite (some weight loss due to that)_ spaciness when the dose was too high.,This has been a great drug for me.  I've been every class of AD during the last five years and finally decided to give the MAOis a try after not finding relief with the others (or finding the side effects intolerable IE SSRIs).  I went with Parnate first which kinda worked but caused me to have blood pressure spikes after each 10mg dose.  I didn't want to switch to Nardil despite lots of people saying it's the best.  Mainly because from what I've read (a lot of anecdotes) it almost always causes weight gain and anorgasmia neither of which I'd tolerate.  So I've been on Marplan 25mg for ~2 months and it's helped a lot.  My mood is better_ I'm better in social situations_ and the only real side effect is food not tasting good.  I don't think that's common and sometimes it's annoying but losing 10lbs so far is amazing - definitely love that  :)  Hope it continues to help and also that they continue to make it (it was pulled from the market once before).....,M,32,2.5  months25mg 1X D,5/20/2010,Marplan

5, 5, dysthymia/chronic depression,No significant ones. Dry mouth_ occasional constipation_ ejaculatory delay.,Have tried 25 or more antidepressants over 25 years_ alone or in combination. This is the only agent that has produced a clear positive response. Other MAOIs_ including parnate and Nardil_ produced little or no response.,M,48, ,4/26/2007,Marplan
6, 4, severe depression,"loss of libido_ difficulty in ejaculating_ somewhat ""driven"" feeling",I had good results with Marplan_ which I took for about 8 weeks (when it stopped working for me_ which does happen).  While it worked_ I went from a bedridden mess to a guy who was having fun with life.  MAOIs (Marplan_ Parnate_ Nardil and EMSAM) are the most powerful antidepressants.  Period.,M,57,2  months,3/21/2006Email,Marplan
