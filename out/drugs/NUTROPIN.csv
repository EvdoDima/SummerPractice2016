0, 5, Pit dysfunction caused x concussion,,This medication is giving me my life back after not being able to function well at all for over three years due to symptoms caused by a concussion that I sustained in an MVA.  It has improved my speech and my cognitive functioning_ relieved me of a significant amount of brain fog and enabled me to move about_ walk better and more often!  I am hopeful that I will continue to improve as I take this medication along with other hormones that I need.  I feel like this medication is a miracle drug - it has immeasurably improved my quality of life since the concussion.,F,36,4.5  months.4mg 1X D,12/31/2013Email,Nutropin
