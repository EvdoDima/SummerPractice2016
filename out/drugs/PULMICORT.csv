2, 1, Asthma,My son was on this when he was 2 and despite continuous and routine treatments_ he had asthma crisis almost every month. The doctor then decided to increase the medicine strength from .25 to .5. After this increase_ he was getting colds_ pneumonia_ and infections pretty often which lead to asthma attacks. I asked his doctor if this medicine weakened his immune system and he said yes. Then I asked him if it it's weakening his immune system then is it counteracting the goal because every time he is sick_ he has asthma attacks. I couldn't get a straight answer. From that moment_ I took him off of Pulmicort and told the doctor I still was giving it to him. Since then_ my son has no asthma attacks and he's now 14  years old.,Avoid this at all cost,M,2,1  years,3/12/2016Email,Pulmicort

4, 2, Asthma,I have severe adrenal gland problems now. Extremely high blood pressure. Have IIH. All probably caused by this drug.,I have been on this for 15 years. These last three years have been hell. I started on a higher dose three years ago and within 2 weeks was in the emergency room. Developed panic attacks_ high anxiety_ constantly light headed and was diagnosed with IIH. It has taken me almost 3 years to overcome all of this somewhat. I only inhale one half dose every three days and this has helped a lot. Drs can's say that this drug is the cause but I can. Now I seemingly have growths on one adrenal gland!! Seemingly Pulmicort can cause that. I would never had started this if I had known but it was a newish drug 15 yrs ago.

7, 1, Asthma_ Preventative Care,"My daughter had 2 very severe cases of RSV and was hospitalized.  She's needed oral steroids for breathing problems with other colds before too.  Her Dr prescribed a 2x daily dose of budesonide (pulmicort) and almost instantly she couldn't sleep.  I cut it down to once a day (although the Dr said it shouldn't be a problem) and even with just a single dose her behavior changed.  She was angry_ threw screaming and shaking fits_ and eventually woke up at night screaming and shaking violently screaming ""No!"" for an hour.  I went to give her the medicine the next day and she was scared.  I finally asked if the medicine hurt her and she said yes.  I didn't give it to her and she was fine that night.

15, 2, Mild Persistant Asthma,Insomnia_ Borderline High Blood Pressure_ Upper Chest Pain (Pectoral Muscles).  Side efftects started after six months and got progressively worse.  It did stop asthma symptoms but the insomnia was horrible.  I discontinued taking it and all side effects disappeared.,"Pulmicort worked very well to control my mild asthma_ which was made worse by a case of pneumonia. However_ after a year of taking it_ I had to stop due to side effects (insomnia_ borderline high blood pressure and chest pain near pectoral muscles). For the record_ I never had any of these symptoms before_ and I ignored them for a few months as my (former)pulmonologist and another pulmonologist said that my side effects were not caused by Pulmicort. As soon as I stopped taking it_ however_ they went away. Both doctors told me that it is a very small dose which goes directly to the lung and therefore has no systemic effects. Using this logic however_ inhaling other drugs (like cocaine for example) should have no systemic effects_ which of course is ridiculous. The manufacturer states that 1-3% have these symptoms but downplays them to the point where it appears that they might not be related to the drug. After consultanting with a well-respected microbiologist who researches these and other drugs as well as an allergist and my general practioner_ I learned that my side effects were absolutely possible. Even though the steroid dose is relatively small_ it can build up in your system and cause problems over time. Fortunately_ my asthma is not bothering me now_ however I would encourage anyone taking this drug and other inhaled steroids to be very careful before assuming that they're safe to ""take for the rest of your life.""",M,44,12  months180 MCG 2X D,7/20/2012Email,Pulmicort

Our second kid today has 3 years old and we were giving him pulmicort as well because he is more asthmatic than the first one. The second kid is more sensitive and aggresive when taking pulmicort_ but I hadn ́t related it to the medicine until reading this page. The other thing that made me do the research is that another doctor told us that it is known that pulmicort stops growth in kids_ which is devastating for us seeing the long term effect in our first kid.

27, 2, Young Son Has Asthma,Our son_ now 5 1/2 yrs old was put on pulmicort around age 3 for intermitent asthma flares that were not controllable without prednisone orally.  Long story short_ all his behavior problems gradually grew to where we suspected the pulmicort.  He had all the behavior issues mentioned here in other posts!!!  They started in daycare and followed to Kingergarden.  It is not your child_ it is the MEDICINE!  My wife and I Have been EMTs for 15 years and refused to accept the status quo from the doctors.  We were not informed of the side effects other than stunted growth. Our son gets flares from viruses like colds and flu.  I also investigated other triggers and through disbelief from my wife_ found our son to be allergic to Fleece (polyester found in fleece clothing and blankets).  He itches and coughs his way into a flare.  We never knew until I relentlessly investigated.  I removed all fleece blankets and clothing.,We also tried Singulair (EVEN WORSE) and Flovent (Terrible) with worse_ rage like behavior.  I will NEVER put him on this crap again.  I feel if a child has a problem with one corticosteroid_ they will have a problem with all.  Don't let your doctor tell you different_ make them prove it.We Researched a Herbal supplement call PHYTOCORT.  It is all natural and created by leading asthma doctors.  It is based on ideas stemming from ASHMI asthma treatments.  Our son is doing well by removing the fleece triggers and adding the PHYTOCORT.  We started pulling the capsule apart and mixing it with yogurt.  It tasted bad for him.  One day he just said give me that pill and swallowed it.  He takes one pill_ twice a day now with Albuterol to stop the cough if it occurs.  Good luck parents.  Question your doctors.  They get stuck in their ways and don't want to take the time to explore new treatments.  God Bless.,M,5,2  years 1X D,2/15/2011Email,Pulmicort

40, 2, ,My son was prescribed Pulmicort together with Xopenex since he was 3. It started as an RSV virus at 2.5 years of age. He had reflux really bad as a baby_ I think as a result started being asthmatic with viruses and allergies. The side effects were tremendous: racing heart-rate_ aggressive behavior_ tremors_ nightmares_ pain in bones_ shooting pain in heart. I was crying because my son turned into another person_ I felt like I had a choice betweeen breathing and behavioral change. I felt so bad for him. All the side-effects are not taken seriously by doctors at all. I guess you have to experience this on your own child before you agree to connect the dots.,I finally decided to start to treat alternatively. My sister lives in Switzerland where homeopathy is the daily bread next to the common drugs. After finding a md that was also a homeopath_ I was able to wean him step by step_ still using Pulmicort and Xopenex_ but on a much lower level.We discovered that whenever we drove from Michigan to Florida for spring break_ his then usually bad asthma reaction from allergies and virus combos_ was getting better immediately after we arrived. And then got worse again going back north. After seeing this happen twice_ we decided to move down here. And he has needed Pulmicort and Xopenex only once with the swine flu appedemic!!!! Move to warmer climate and close to salt water. The  difference is worth the move!!! Learn as much about the way your child can react and then observe very closely. A pulse ox meter at home_ there are available on the internet below $200 and a stethoscope will help calm you or alert you to go see the doc or start the meds. It helps tremendously to start relaxing somewhat and not panic every time they start coughing. Doctors don't like the pulse ox_ but it has helped to start meds at the right time while we were still in the cold USA and made us go to the ER at the right time_ too_ instead of waiting for pneumonia.

Nite bed wetting caused delayed potty training.,"I'm crying as I read the posts on this site.  I just had a behavioral conference for my 4 yr old boy at his preschool last week due to this behavior.  My son was started on pulmicort at 2 yrs old after 2 consecutive boughts of pneumonia within a 4 week period and a diagnosis of asthma.  It seemed to work so much better than albuterol.  The behavior he is currently displaying has carried over from what we chalked up to the ""terrible twos"".  Tha asthma has flared up in the past 2 yrs even with the pulmicort during the cold season.  I asked the doctor at his 4 yr check up if the behavior could be from the medicine and didn't get a direct answer.  I asked how his lungs sounded and he thought they sounded great.  We were advised to wait through the blooming period for seasonal allergies and then stop the meds approx the end of May 2009.  He had a flare up at the end of May and I have continued the meds through till last nite.  The parent/teacher conference resulted in a daily journal to be passed back and forth from me to teachers.  I am AMAZED at how frequent he is displaying these behaviors. I turned to the internet for possible answers and found this site.  Every other post is describing my sons behavior.  He can be incredibly sweet and loving and is so smart and can turn in an instant.  I was actually thinking my 4 yr old could be bipolar!  He is off this medicine starting now.

I am absolutely appalled and grateful that I have found this site.  My son has been overweight for most of his life and doesn't eat much at all. I have to watch everything that goes in his mouth.  He is very athletic and plays football and baseball and does the normal things that boys do.  All of the doctors have told me that there is nothing to be concerned about by having him on the Pulmicort.  They say that there are not enough studies to confirm the ""weight gain"" side effect.  I thought that I was going crazy_ I would count his calories_ prepare his lunches for school and always make sure his meals at home were healthy and he is still gaining weight.  He is now in the 7th grade and at 206 pounds.  He is tall for his age but not enough to carry a 200 pound body.  I am infuriated.

62, 4, Asthma,Acne_ insomnia_ waking up in the middle of the night_ runny nose once inhaler (by nebulizer) started_ eye infection.,"My children are in day care and the day care provider must think I am abusing my son and neglecting him medically.  He is breaking out with small pin-point sized sores all over his handlsome little face.  He picks obsessively causing them to bleed.  Also picking his nose (which could just be age related but it has increased since starting the med). It does help his asthma and I give it to him once a day at night because he coughs at night if I don't give it.  The Flovent wasn't as helpful as he would wake up at night coughing and even a repeat dose of it wouldn't relieve his cough.  This med does help greatly but with a lot of side effects.  I am not sure if his hyperactivity is just age-related and being filled with energy and happiness or if it is from this medication.  He can sit still and isn't constantly hyper but the way he is breaking out on his face is bothersome to me.  I am not sure if those areas are itching causing him to pick.  I didn't realize this med causes the acne until I read the leaflet in the box today.  Now I am relieved it's not something else and nothing that the day care provider or CPS can blame ME for doing or not doing to care for my child appropriately (bed bugs_ etc).  I have had ""dealings"" with CPS in the past (domestic violence victim) and everything is a worry to me when it comes to my children.

Though he has been on it intermittently for five years (since he was 6 months old) he has probably spent far more time not needing anything.

He was not on this medicine long enough to know if it made a difference though I did notice a decrease in his nighttime coughing. He became a different child and we never realized how bad it had gotten until we had him off of pulmicort for a few days.  He was the little boy he used to be_ a normal 3 year old_ happy and healthy. The doctor was very hesitant to take him off the treatment_ saying that the chances of the side effects we were seeing being from the medicine were so slim and insisted that it was his (my son) way of coping with having 2 younger siblings.  He agreed to a 2 week break from the meds and we are so happy with the outcome.  So far_ no breathing issues and my son is back to his normal self.

She remained on it while in the cast. 6 weeks after the cast came off she broke her arm again in the same 2 places. After extended research my husband and I firmly believe the Pulmicort is to blame; after the second break we took her off of it and yesterday the doctor told me she regrew FOUR TIMES as much new bone as the last time (each in a 6 week period). Coincidence? I think not. Do the research yourself; it is in the fine print. Pulmicort has been definitively linked to bone weakness and increased likelihood of fractures. Not to mention the horrible mood swings! My daughter is back to her happy_ cooperative_ obedient self since stopping the meds. From now on we will do EVERYTHING in our power to avoid Pulmicort and you should_ too.

An active lifestyle helps with both.  Our child is actively involved in swimming and is allowed to run around lots at home even in the house:) He is learning where it is appropriate to run and where it is not.

Surgery at age 20 dealt to it fairly well for 35 years then I started getting recurrent bronchitis that my GP mistreated because he wouldn't allow antibiotics for longer than 10 days and kept prescribing a different one each time it recurred within a week. Finally he referred me to a chest physician who gave me 6 months' augmentin! The bugs are killed in the first few days but the damaged tissues are vulnerable for much longer and need extended protection until they build resistance. I was told to do daily postural drainage to get rid of irritant non-pathogens that lower immunity and take 20-30 days augmentin for future infections. I was also prescribed Pulmicort and told to limit absorption by washing my mouth out and gargling afterwards. After a year or so things got back to normal but my GP said keep using Pulmicort to prevent a recurrence. 7 years later at age 71 I was diagnosed with osteoporosis - a total surprise as I thought I had all the r,I once got some advice from another doctor on long-term medication: when symptoms improve try cutting it out for a couple of weeks to see if you still need it_ because often you don't.
