0, 1, Wisdom tooth extraction,Intense nausea that can only be explained by my stomach actually trying to claw its way out of my body. I vomited every 20 minutes and any time I tried to eat or drink anything. When there was no more blood_ saliva_ and stomach acid_ I dry heaved. I cried pretty much the whole time and had a massive panic attack. At a couple points I laughed hysterically until it turned into sobbing. I was extremely anxious_ drenched in sweat_ and freezing cold. I was dizzy_ could barely move_ and it felt like my apartment was being spun into another dimension. Not only did it really not help the pain from my extraction_ it seemed to distribute the pain to the rest of my unsuspecting body. All I wanted to do was sleep_ but it was impossible until it finally wore off_ several hours after I initially took the drug_ but what felt to be an eternity.,Literally the worst experience of my life. I was sure I was dying. I would warn my worst enemy against using this drug.,F,24,1  days,3/8/2016Email,Vicodin

4, 3, Post breast lift,"post surgery I wanted to ""stay ahead of the pain"" so I began taking the Vicodin about 4 hours after I got out of surgery. Helped with pain very well for the first 2 days. The last 3 days the pain was at bay but I had a slew of side effects ranging from depressed mood_ panic/anxiety_ super increased heart rate_ feeling just plain on another planet_ shallow breathing to the point I was afraid to fall asleep until it passed. I was mostly surprised and dissatisfied with the panic/fearfulness and mood swings. I felt like I was taking a bad batch of illegal street drugs/uppers as opposed to the prescribed pain med it actually is! After day 5 I still had pills left over but decided to switch to Tylenol. Night of day 6 (first day not taking Vicodin) I fell asleep early and realized I had the deepest most restful sleep during that whole ordeal. Woke up next day feeling  significantly better as Vicodin was really getting out of my system.  Oh and constipation was not a prob because I used Metamucil and senna tea.",Good for short term pain. Watch out for longer use. Part of the time I felt relaxed_ slightly euphoric and pain free. Other part was extremely anxious/fearful but I've gotten used to dealing with anxiety from other experiences and have gotten decent with remembering to breathe_ self soothing and waiting for the panic to pass. Good luck to you all,F,26,5  days5x,3/31/2015,Vicodin

6, 3, Wisdom teeth extraction,Extreme nausea and vomiting,I was hesitant to use this medication in the first place and after this experience I don't want to take it ever again.

8, 1, Back pain,At first I felt a little euphoric but within a short time a horrible feeling of nauseau overwhelmed me. The room was spinning and I spent the next 2 hours hugging the toilet vomiting. I wanted to go to the hospital and felt like I was dying. I finally managed to crawl into bed and prayed I would fall asleep. In the morning I felt mostly better but still spinning from the night before and still my stomach wasn't right. I would never recommend this medicine to anyone. STAY AWAY!,,F,46,1  days 1X D,11/9/2014,Vicodin
9, 5, degenerative disk disease_ arthritis,Euphoria_ itchy_ dry mouth,I was taking vicodin on and off for 2 years_ but every day now for the last year. My prescribed dose is 20mg a day_ but I've noticed my tolerance going up. I try to skip days_ but the pain is awful and I find myself craving the vicodin_ which I do not like. I know it's an addictive drug_ but it helps my pain for right now.,F,32,3  years10/325,11/6/2014Email,Vicodin
10, 4, back pain (arthritis in spine),none really,Took this med for several years before my tolerance just didn't allow it to work anymore and doc switched me to something else. This worked wonders for my back pain and enabled me to function on a daily basis. It was great while it lasted_ unfortunately it is known for tolerance being a problem.,F,43,5  years10 mg 4X D,6/30/2014,Vicodin

12, 3, Back pain of muscular origin.,Euphoria.,More euphoria than actual pain relief. And it's usefulness goes down to nothing after taking it just a few days. A rapid tolerance_ moreso than other opiates. It's the type of drug that's only beneficial if taken every now & a Blue Moon -- not regularly. Really it isn't a great pain reliever overall. I guess it's prescribed so much simply because it makes patients happy for a few days.,M,49,3  months15 2X D,5/17/2014Email,Vicodin
13, 5, Colitis_ Migraines_ MS,I have been taking Vicodin for several issues as needed. It works great for my pain_ which can be severe at times. I do notice some itching and constipation_ but compared to my pain_ it's nothing! Be sure to drink plenty of water while taking this medication. Eat with a snack or light meal to prevent upset stomach if that is an issue for you. Overall_ this is a wonderful drug for me!,,F,34,3  years5/325,1/8/2014,Vicodin

15, 1, Tooth Infection,I would sleep all day which I didn't like because I couldn't take care of my daughter properly. I felt really sick all day_ every time I moved I felt like throwing up.

19, 5, Chronic migraines_ depression,None. I use it as a prevention and treatment of migraines. Because it lifts mood_ increases alertness and energy_ I use it for severe depression that occurs in the winter. Generally take 2-3 a day. Taking more is counter-productive.  Works better than any anti-depressants I've tried.,,F,59,10  years7.5/350,1/26/2013,Vicodin
20, 3, Pain,nausea and dizziness,I know that doctors prescribe Vicodin as an effective pain reliever. However_ it is very strong and addictive.

24, 5, chronic back pain,My PCP prescribed Vicodin in stead of the usual crazy drugs for my low back pain; I feel sorry for patients forced into taking Cymbalta etc when responsible narcotic use can work wonders. The only side-effect that I  had was constipation and I didn't tell my doctor until the constipation had become severe.  During an exam in her office she was feeling my abdomen and asked when I had my last BM and when I said 4-5 days_ she nodded to the nurse who left the room_ returning a few minutes later with an IV pole with a big enema bag full of soapy water..and I got the how to prevent constipation lecture from the nurse and from my doctor as I got every drop.

28, 4, Sciatica/Sciatic Flare-up,Constipation_ Dizziness_ Drowsiness,Combined with massive amounts of Ibprofuen_ this helped me get through quite a bit of pain.  Typically I'd feel a little dizzy/drowsy for about an hour after but it worked wonders for the sciatic nerve pain.  If anything I would have preferred an extended release drug instead: I'd usually wake up in terrible pain a few hours after taking it before bed after it had eventually worn off.  The constipation is a whole 'nothing issue: if I actually took the 3 tablets x a day_ this would cause major problems with the piping.  By the third week I winded up only using it once a day or so when the pain was too much in order to avoid further bathroom disasters.,F,28,3  weeks5-500mg 3X D,7/12/2012Email,Vicodin

Extreme paranoia and the feeling as if there was something bad going to happen. I figured I didn't have enough to eat with the pill and maybe that was what caused it. Second night_ I had plenty of food but had the most vivid and intense nightmare EVER. Woke up drenched in sweat and panicking. I won't be taking vicidin again.,,F,23,2  days10,1/15/2012,Vicodin

It wasn't great with pain but it made me sleep so it made it bareable.,,F,16,4  days500 mg,1/14/2012,Vicodin

I had slight nausea_ and tonight I found out how paranoid it can make you. I was literally running around my house_ checking to make sure everything was locked_ like I had OCD.

56, 4, Chronic dental and testicular pain,"The most common side effect that I experienced was a false sense of well being or euphoria. While this is pleasant_ it can be troublesome because it makes me not care as much about my problems or want to address them_ and makes me lazy. For example_ I consider calling in sick to work even though I feel okay because I want to enjoy the ""high"" and my day.Other positive side effects I experience include increased talkativeness and desire to socialize_ increased enjoyment of everyday activities_ increased enjoyment of food and an increased ability to relax. The worst negative side effect I've had with Vicodin are fairly frequent nightmares (about twice a week) and a little nausea  with higher doses (15 - 20 mg at a time). Unlike most people_ I don't get constipated or experience an upset stomach while using vicodin. After a few weeks of continual use_ I feel that I am somewhat addicted to the medication_ but I don't feel that it's a severe addiction.

69, 5, 8 foot surguries;endometriosis pain,Lots of itching_ mild nausea if taken on empty stomach. It affects me differently based on when i take it. Right after surguries i take it every 4 hours so it keeps me pretty loopy_ tired_ etc etc. For my endometriosis pain its one of the only thing that works_ and based on my pain thats how i take it. It doesnt make me as loopy or nauseas when i take it lets say once a day. But usually just takes my pain away and lets me get out of a fetal postition and do things. Also_ when taken on an empty stomach it usually puts me right to sleep/makes my tummy hurt.,"As a chronic pain sufferer vicoden is a God sent. It works(at least for me) for both bone pain (due to reconstructive foot surguries) and muscle pain ( due to endometriosis). Ive been taking it for 6 years and it works great for me. Its not addictive_ at least for me. Alot of people and/or doctors dont like to use it because it can be ""addictive"" but when youre actually in pain and use it properly it works wonders. and worth a bit of an upset tummy :)",F,19,6  years5-500 2X D,10/14/2011Email,Vicodin

After waking felt hungover and oddly very sensitive hair follicles(not sure if that's happens to anyone else).,Works great in numbing the pain but doesn't last long enough for the prescribed intervals. No real hampering in functionality other than a slight delay in reaction time but only when trying to do something I had never done previously or on a day to day basis.

OK for short surgery recovery.,If you are at high risk for cancer V will mask most  pelvic/abdominal soft tissue sensation. That can interfere with early detection. It takes 5 days to clear your system so I take a week off from it every 2 months. I just went 14 days recently because the normal feeling was good.,M,63,9  months5-500mg 4X D,10/3/2011Email,Vicodin

89, 5, Back pain/ Pars Defect,Sleeplessness_ Loss of Appetite_ Euphoria_ Energy,So for this drug I would have to say it is probably the best drug on the market. For that reason only it is the worst drug on the market. This to me is more addicting than the stronger meds such as methadone and oxycodone. I know everyone is different but in my perspective this and percocet should be taken off and just prescribe the harder pain pills. I would also have to say that the high from these and the mood is wonderful. This is why it is so addictive so if you are prescribed this drug I would ask for something else and also for any tooth related pain this shit dont work. Ibuprofen 800 are wonderful for any pain related to denistry. Also if you do want to take these pills and are not an addict take exactly as told because if not once the doc drops you which he will it will be a lot easier. If you are addicted to this medication already I highly suggest asking your doctor for tramadol and take three or four a day for a week and then stop and you will feel perfectly fine. Promise you that. This is a nsaid drug with a slight amount of the opiate vicodin has and in that dosage it will stop any withdrawls by taking tramadol/ultram for one week straight.,M,19,2  years5/500 4X D,6/1/2011Email,Vicodin

No libido_ bloatedness_ and the worst of all...THE INABILITY TO POOP!",This medicine works great if you feel like relieving migraine paint/anxiety; however_ for me_ the bad side effects far outweighed the good.  You may think that constipation is no big deal_ but it was severe.  So severe that I would be bloated and look 4 months pregnant.  Now I know why Elvis looked the way he did.  Withdrawal lasted about 10-14 days with near contant vomiting_ diarrhea_and a weird oily skin feeling that made me take about 3 showers a day. I lost about 15 lbs.  That being said_ the pain relief is weird; it's like_ you can still feel the migraine pain_ but you just don't care that it's there.,F,44,7  years7.5/750 6X D,5/4/2011Email,Vicodin
92, 3, Extreme Menstrual Cramping,It works much better than just taking plain acetametaphine_ but it isn't always effective. It does make me somewhat drowsy_ but when I sleep it makes me CRAZY sweaty.,Resist the temptation to take more than you are prescribed. Vicodin contains an opiate_ but MOSTLY it contains acetametaphine_ which can be lethal (complete liver failure) if you take too much. A 500mg dose of Vicodin isn't 500mg of opiate. It is 500mg of acetametaphine. Just be wary_ because a lot of people don't realize that and they can cause some wicked problems for themselves.,F,23,12  months500mg 2X D,4/30/2011Email,Vicodin

The next day I woke up_ once again super hyper and happy and pain-free.Then the third day I woke up...at 4 pm...feeling like death warmed over. I couldn't think straight whatsoever. I was extremely dizzy. If I moved or turned my head too fast the room would be spinning. It took all of my willpower and concentration to keep from throwing up at ALL times. If I didnt eat with the pill I felt sick. If I ate with the pill I felt sicker. And I couldnt do the most simple things_ like I tried to put my shoes on and fell over twice. This caused me to get super super frustrated and angry. Like not normal anger. I would get genuinely PISSED for absolutely no reason. I was in a depressed fog of nauseous rage for 3 days. So I went down to half a pill. This didnt help so I swore it off and went with regular ol ibuprofen. It took about 12 hours for the nasty side effects to go away.

Although I'm afraid that drug addiction could be in my genes (is that possible??) I don't feel the need to take these pills once the reason for the pain has been alleviated (healed from surgery or dental work/tooth extraction_ etc.) even though the ""high"" feeling is fabulous.  I think the longest I've taken it is a week.  I can take with or without food without any nausea and sleep with no problems.  It's fantastic.

One year ago_ 2009_ I was in an accident fracturing four ribs_ lacerated spleen_ torn rotator cuff tendons_ punctured lung and a small fracture of a vertebrae.

I've been taking indomethacin (1 - 50mg pill 3 times a day) but after 4 days of taking indomethacin and a break of not taking any medication for 2 days_ I figured I'd try the vicodin because my mother kept saying how quick it brought down my father's pain and swelling.  Well I personally will never take this drug again because as previously mentioned_ within 15 mins of taking my resting heart rate averaged between 104-116 for 2 - 2.5 hours and I felt an increased urge to urinate every 30-45 mins.  I felt jittery or anxious after an hour and it lasted for 3 hours_ and because of that_ I couldn't just lay down and rest my mind.  My mind began to wander in borderline bad thoughts and a heightened sense of fear came over me.  The worse side effect I experienced with this drug is that as I laid down on my bed_ I would close my eyes in an attempt to try to sleep but I felt like my breathing became shallower and off track (so to speak).  I had to consciously take gasps of air because I actually felt like I wasn't breathing properly.  (Respiratory Depression) --> Google it if you need to.

126, 5, rotator cuff surgery,At first the medication made me tired and helped me sleep_ but after several months of use it started to give me tons of energy and actually helped my depression. I would get up in the morning feeling lethargic and depressed and then take one and within an hour I was feeling completely normal and full of life and energy..instead of feeling depressed I felt like everything was great.  Ive suffered with depression for many years and have yet to find something that works..I know I cant take these for depression..just wish there was something out there that worked like they do.,Completely took the pain away after surgery and helped with other pain like headaches and cramps.,F,41,6  months750 3X D,7/25/2010Email,Vicodin

It did it's job and relieved the pain_ but the side effects were bizarre.  Strange dreams happened a lot_ but not nightmares_ just the dreams that are hard to separate from reality.  The nausea may have been caused by the combination of Vicodin with another medication I am taking concurrently.,F,31, 7.5/700 mg 1X AN,7/8/2010,Vicodin

132, 3, wisdom teeth (2) extraction,first time i took it i felt really good - like i was high... second time i took it a few hours later and it just kept the pain away... took it two other times that day and it simply kept the pain away... so_ the first day i took it 4 times and it did its jobtook it in the morning on the second day with a smoothie and after an hour i took a shower. when getting out of the shower i felt extremely dizzy_ had extreme difficulty breathing_ and started hallucinating. i held onto the towel bar in my bathroom because i thought i was going to faint. next thing i knew i was on the floor... the towel bar broken_ and a huge pain in the back of my head (i had hit it against something)... i dunno how long i was out but when i woke back up i was still dizzy and had trouble breathing... i called 911 and went to the emergency room.,the docs said that the vicodin made my blood pressure plummet and told me that's why i fainted. never taking this medicine again!!! it made me feel like i was going to die! so basically_ if you are going to take this medicine_ be very careful about how you take it... if you have problems with low blood pressure i would not recommend taking this medicine at all... take ibuprofen instead!!,F,21,2  days5mg/500mg 2X D,6/24/2010,Vicodin

The only thing is_ is that it makes you feel extremely euphoric.  You feel great.  It is seriously no joke when people say it.  I have a hard time understanding how it is even legal.

138, 5, Severe head injury,Calmness_ drowsiness_ occasional nausea,I was in a car accident and Vicodin helped me by not only relieving pain_ but also to relax and get the sleep I needed. I felt nauseous usually only if I hadn't eaten before taking the prescription_ so eating before simply resolved the feeling. Unfortunately_ it is easy to understand how people get addicted so easily to this drug. When my pain began to subside I slowly stopped taking the prescription over a week to avoid any possible withdrawal symptoms.,F,19,3  weeks500 mg 4X D,5/27/2010,Vicodin

140, 1, Wisdom Teeth Removal,Vomiting_ Nausea_ Dizziness_ Cloudy Feeling,At first_ I thought it was great. After I got my wisdom teeth removed_ I began taking Vicodin with 3 Ibuprofen every 4 hours. Shortly after taking them_ I'd fall into a really deep sleep and when I'd wake up I'd talk and say nonsensical things. Because I was on a liquid diet_ there wasn't much substance in my stomach and the medicine tore my stomach apart. I vomited for hours on end until there was nothing left and then I proceeded to dry heave for hours. Because of the stress of vomiting_ the extraction sites got infected and now I'm miserable and have no effective way to relieve my pain until my appointment tomorrow.

Mistake. If i missed the window the drug did not help me sleep and i end up having a hard time sleeping. However_ great sleep if i actually took advantage of what the drug is supposed to do.

I cannot believe the FDA has not put a 'duplicate' needed or whatever it is now_ as it is a horribly addicting drug. I have struggled for years with this narcotic. When I am in the hospital_ I seem to get hooked on it for a year or so. If I take one_ I now know I will have a problem. Then you have to take several eventually to reach that eurphoric feeling. It grabs you by the neck and never lets go_ until you feel chocked and have either severe physical problem or have lost all relationships due to the change in personality. I'll never touch the stuff again and I know I have an addiction towards it. However_ when used just as prescribed and never taking more_ it is a good pain reliever. Once you have crossed the line though_ it is a drug you can't control. I have been free from it now for 8 months (this time).

It took away the pain and kept me sleeping around the clock but I want my life back so I quickly switched to Tylenol. I don't feel this drug is necessary and the way it makes your head feel all dizzy and messed up isn't worth the benefits.

It helps I have noticed to take a small dose of anxiety med (xanax)  Helps a bunch with nausea with this medication although in some people can really make you tired (driving limitations too).  I have been on xanax for years for anxiety related to depresson and just happened to notice the anti-nausea effect it had while taking vicodin at the same time. Worth a try if you need pain relief without the side effect of nausea.  Constipation can be an issue if taken for extended periods. Use Miralax powder daily and alternate with metamucil.  Lots of water will help too. Only take for pain relief and addiction shouldn't be an issue.,,F,42,6  months,12/1/2009,Vicodin

I started taking four 5/500s a day but soon built up a tolerance. Within a month_ I was taking up to 8 day. And then I got seriously addicted. I started buying them 100 to 200 at a time. Within 5 months of daily use I was taking 12 to 18 a day (5/500s). I stopped caring about the pain relief and only cared about the high. I spent almost all of my paycheck on them every week. I've been taking them for over a year now. The only reason I still take them is I went through withdrawal once and I'm not going to do it again. When you detox_ you get anxiety attacks_ vomiting_ muscle aches_ chills_ bone pain_ the list goes on. Now I'm trying wean myself off. Basically what I'm saying is DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG UNLESS IT IS PRESCRIBED TO YOU. If you want a high_ smoke some bud. It's cheaper_ less expensive_ and not addicting.

189, 4, Arthritis knees_neck & shoulder,Vivid dreams_ sometimes drowsy_ sometimes hyper. possible lower hearing levels?,After over 20 years of pain and multiple surgery's its a miracle drug. Pain never stopped me from doing much but now I'm MUCH less volatile. I do feel like a junkie picking up the meds but have stopped or ran out a few time without a withdrawal problem. Might even allow me to survive obama!,M,41,3  years,8/13/2009,Vicodin
190, 4, Chronic pain / Breakthrough,Constipation_ weight gain,It works - that's why it's THE most widely prescribed drug out there.  But it's usually compounded with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and there's now a lot of concern about long term use and what effects it may have on the liver.,M,42,4  years,8/6/2009,Vicodin
191, 1, Cracked tooth,None.,Had a painful tooth. Doc couldn't do anything about it until next day so prescribed Vicoprofen (7.5mg Hydrocodone[Vicodin] 200mg Ibuprofen).  Did nothing for me.  Couldn't sleep cuz of pain. Doc wanted to phone in prescription for Percocet but because that drug's abused the 24/7 pharmacy would only accept a written prescription.  So Doc changes it to 10mg Hydrocodone/500mg Acetaminophen.  Take it - an hour later nothing - no pain relief_ no highs_ no itching_ no drowsiness or insomnia_ nothing.  Take a 2nd one - still nothing.  Will just have to stay up all night (can't sleep due to pain) and drive to the dentist in the morning.  I've never had Vicodin before - I must be naturally resistant.,M,51,1  days,7/30/2009,Vicodin
192, 1, phantom pain in the foot,The side effects were horrible at best.  Cannot imagine someone taking this drug for recreational purposes.  The worst was the mental aspects from feeling completely alone_ euphoric_ very depressed_ unable to sit still_ unable to continue doing any sort of task to completion.  The nausea was a daily event...thank God for Ginger which got me thru many a day.Sleeping was ok but the pain never really was removed_ just lessened considerably.  When I stopped taking it_ the withdrawal was something I never want to go thru again..,They say it is potentially addictive.   I only took it for 3 weeks and had horrible withdrawal.  Please be very careful with this or any form of this drug.....it is VERY Habit forming.,M,72,21  days,7/23/2009Email,Vicodin

I am very talkative and in a great mood but it ends as effectiveness wears off and then I am snappy and can produce rebound headaches",Vicodin is the only thing that works when I get a full blown migraine.  I have tried everything on the market and this is the only one that works if I don't catch it beforehand.  I have been on this medication as needed for 6 years and have had to take it for days at a time and have not had a problem with addiction.  The problem I do see when I have to use it for a few days is its effectiveness.  I usually take on an empty stomach with a phenegren b/c of nausea and have to double up on dosage.,F,35,6  years,7/17/2009,Vicodin

App. 12 Extra Strength per day.,This drug works but it is very evil. I have been on this a long time and gave it up last month. Withdrawals are very rough for about a week then gets easier. These pills will kill your liver and kidneys. They will have bad effects on your brain. I tell you this first hand. Long term_ these pills have ruined my life. It's time for me to take it back.

228, 5, Back pain,Never experienced any negative side effects from any dose of vicodin.  Generally there is a very noticable cessation of pain accompanied with an extreme sense of euphoria.  I am very_ very cautious with this drug as I can easily see how one could become quite attached to the happy feelings elicited by this drug.  While other pain meds_ again for me at least_ seem to cause some constipation and other mild side effects_ vicodin addresses my pain with zero side effects.,As noted by other patients_ if I take a course of this medication for several days_ I need to skip a day as my body seems to adjust and there is absolutely no response whatsoever...no amelioration of pain nor any euphoria.  I try never to go more than 3 days during any pain episide.  It's as if I had not even take the vicodin.,M,50,5  days,2/20/2009,Vicodin

It works for me and it is the first time I have been able to sleep without nervous_ twitching legs. He also prescribed Mirapex_ but I had a very bad reaction to this drug.

The morphine seemed to do little_ so I depended more on the liquid Vicodin.  Throughout the second week of my recovery_ feelings of impatience and anger overtook me and combined themselves horribly with depression_ despair_ suicidal thoughts...all of which was completely unexpected given that I am well-adjusted and content.

At first I didn't think anything of it but soon it was happening everytime I fell asleep.  It was so bad I only started taking half a pill which wouldn't take the pain away but it took the nightmares away.  Also I had a rash on the inside of my elbows that was very annoying_ nausea that wouldn't go away until they gave me something for it and moodiness.

I feel sluggish and depressed and slow-moving -- exhausted and hopeless while simultaneously feeling a sense of agitation and doom. I'm able to act normal and I'm sure I'm not in any sort of danger_ but I feel like I want someone in the room with me just to make sure.

I find myself having racing thoughts about random topics. My stomach started to hurt (mostly becuase I made the mistake of not taking it with food) I felt itchy and had extremely bad cotton mouth. It made me feel like I was on Meth when I used to do it. (I have been clean off of that stupid drug for over a year and a half).

257, 5, middle back pain emerging at night,Euphoric calm and caffeine like effect if more than one tablet taken (rarely need more than one).  Early sleep stage seems particularly deep. If one of my kids wakes me after 1-2 hours of sleep_ it regularly feels like i have been asleep for 5+ hours!  However_ dreams have seemed to disappear on vicodin.,It works!  After chiropractic_ osteopathic_ accupuncture_ physical and physiotherapy_ steroid injections_ massage therapy_ taking one 7.5/750 tab before bed was the easiest and most effective solution for this type of least treatable back pain.  once I am up and about_ I have no daytime back or neck pain.,M,48,10  years,10/27/2008Email,Vicodin

259, 4, Severe period cramps,Subtle dizziness_ occasional anxiety_dry mouth and sometimes short term memory loss.,Because of fibroid tumors_ my periods are extemely heavy and painful for 2 to 3 days out of the month.  There is no other pain reliever that can help.  Without vicodin_ I would be bed ridden with pain during that time.  I can function thanks to vicodin.  I usually take half of the recommended dose.  I have been doing this for a good five years and I don't experience any withdrawal signs on the days I don't take them.,F,49,5  years,10/17/2008,Vicodin
260, 3, abscessed molar and extraction,some nausea and vomiting_ arrhythmia_ insomnia_ suicidal depression_ anxiety attacks_ mood swings and crying jags,I took Vicodin eight times over six days so it wasn't continuous. While it was great in taking the pain away_ the obsessive suicidal preoccupation and planning is debilitating and has frightened my husband terribly. And myself. I had never taken narcotics or opiates before. Nor recreational drugs because I always sensed I would not fair well on them because my parents couldn't handle drugs well and became addicted. So I stayed away. But this tooth pain was excruciating and I was desperate. It helped with the pain. But I have stopped taking it since the pain has diminished and I will not take it again. The scary depression is not worth it. I hope it leaves my system soon.,F,39,6  days,10/16/2008,Vicodin

Loss of memory after.,itching and insomnia seem to be fairly common with this drug yet I can't find any listings that name insomnia as a side effect.

263, 5, Pain from a foot injury.,Extreme itching_ cotton mouth_ & dehydration.,It works really well for me_ but it's different for everyone. It makes me itch_ severely_ but I'm not allergic.

264, 4, Severe Low Back Pain,Drowsiness_ Loss of appetite_ Occasional rash on stomach_ Occasional itchiness,I take vicodin as needed each day for back pain.

So for now this will have to do.,F,34,7  months,9/29/2008,Vicodin
265, 1, Knee surgery,Vomiting_ nausea_ drowsiness_ anxiety_ no energy,While taking the drug I experienced the vomiting_ nausea_ & drowsiness and it did little for the pain.  The nausea wasn't quite so bad if I lay down for a while.  So I quit taking it_ had one good day_ but the second day_ severe anxiety (never suffered from before in my life)_ shortness of breath_ no appetite_ takes all my energy to get somewhere in the house then I have to stop and rest.  It is just awful.  I can't imagine ever being addicted to this drug.,F,43,1  days,9/27/2008,Vicodin
266, 3, Root Canal,EXTREME ITCHING and sleeplessness,It knocked out the pain_ but the itching and insomnia are not worth it.  I thought this would help me sleep.  It did just the opposite for me. Next time I will take Tylenol P.M. instead.,F,47,2  days,9/25/2008,Vicodin

274, 3, Kidney stone/kidney infection,Before my last two times taking Vicodin there was no side effects other than happiness (no pain!)_ somewhat giddy_ high feeling. However the last two times that I have taken it I have gotten an itchy rash that appears on my knees_ stomach_ arms and elbows. It occurs after about a week of one Vicodin per day. I haven't confirmed with a doctor that the rash is from the Vicodin_ but it only occurs after I take the pills. I also feel like I have a never ending headache that makes me feel rather lightheaded and nauseous.,I have been taking vicodin on and off for about 4 years for a chronic kidney condition and stones. Vicodin used to be my only relief. It was always hard asking for it too (after 4 years you know what you want/need but being a 20yr old girl asking for a narcotic raises some red flags). Lately_ I have been getting relief for the first few days and after that I get itchy and it doesn't work as well.,F,20,4  years,7/31/2008,Vicodin

280, 4, root canal,Vicodin did the trick of making me not feel my tooth or any tenderness from the tooth repair. I did sleep_ but I did remmeber that I had WEIRD dreams!! Then when I went to take my Vicodin after 15 hours_ I thought I would go straight to sleep. I couldn't!! I tried one beer to see if that would help me sleep. Nope! Strangey enough_ I had a cup of coffee and THAT put me into a deep sleep. Not complaining except I did not expect that at all!,,F,49,3  days,7/9/2008,Vicodin

282, 4, Wisdom teeth extractions,Drowsiness-then insomnia_ light-headed_ and constipation were the bad side effects. My head felt like it was floating a few times though. I didn't mind that at all.,I was prescribed Vicodin after my wisdom teeth were taken out. I didn't use it much as first on account of driving_ and IBuprophen usually worked. Then I developed two dry sockets and was told to take a bit more. This is when the floating head feeling came into play. That I didn't mind. I did get a bit constipated and on occasion I felt a bit light-headed but it was not severe. One time after taking_ I would get drowsy and fall asleep_ other times I would be up all night (literally). I reccomend Vicodin for pain though. It definatly has helped me.

Intermittent levels of extreme drowsiness,Great drug and lots of fun to take_ but like with any drug you become tolerant to the level you are prescribed and have to take more and more to get the same effects.  Though it is fun_ the addictive part to the drug is not fun; after taking it for 3 years (sustained) & finally stopping cold turkey_ I have started taking it again due to a fracture in my lower back_ only to have left off at the dosage level I needed way back when.

Shouldn't take before bed.  Disturbing slowed respiratory effect at times -- more disturbing at night. ""Crash"" brings about fatigue_ poor concentration and irritability that affects relationships and work output. Often more hungry. Heightened sexual arousal but greatly weakened performance.","Doseage of one or two a day brings about some fine ""mind numbing"" (i.e. ""stoned"")_ to aid in pain relief_ but became too easy to take ""for the fun of it.""

It says to take 1 every 3-6 hours. I have been taking one every 3 hours and it is not taking the pain away at all. I was considering taking a double dose. But I am going in to see my dentist in a couple hours. I will just deal with the pain for a few more hours.,M,23,2  days,6/2/2008,Vicodin
295, 5, Migraine,Zero pain_ which is GREAT for aura-type migraines.  Oh_ and giddy_ like 2 good cocktails.  A strong cup of coffee with one vicodin and it evens you out and you feel PERFECT.  After it wears off_ a little itchy and sounds seem louder and tinny-sounding but that is well worth skipping the pain stage of aura migraines.,I take them ONLY when I see the aura coming on (vision is blocked by colors in zig-zag form in one area or whole vision field_ this is a common headache type. ).  This way_ no addiction possible_ because I only get these about 4 times a year.  Vicodin is my miracle drug for migraines_ without them I'd have to go through completely unbearable pain as if someone is poking a metal stick through your head and out your eyes.,M,49, ,5/28/2008Email,Vicodin

After that_ I did not take again until about six years later when I got ""killer cramps"" periodically in the area I had the surgery initially.  THIS TIME_ IT DID NOT KNOCK ME OUT.  It eased the pain in about 20 minutes_ but it gave me a nauseous feeling_ along with a feeling I guess people would call ""high"".  To me_ this was NOT a good feeling.  I could not function_ let alone drive!!! So I could only take it at night_ although not necessarily limited to bedtime.  I could still watch TV for example.I didn't take it again until last year for a minor outpatient kidney procedure.  I just took it once or twice.

As prescribed i was to take it every 4 hours.  The pills did relieve most of the pain_ but wore off in half that time and would cause sever stomach pains if I tried to take more than the recommended amount.

I took the first 2 about 6 hours after I got home from the hospital and within an hour I was so high I didnt even know my name.  I felt no pain what so ever but I didnt like the high feeling associated with it.  So_ I cut my dose in half_ only taking 1 pill every 6 hours.  It didnt knock the pain out completely but it made it manageable and I didnt feel high.  Where 2 pills made me really high_ 1 pill made me slightly drowsy.  It also made my face tickle.  Not really an itch but enough that I wanted to touch my face to make it stop.  I had no hives associated with the tickles.  I was also prescribed medication to counter constipation that usually comes with taking vicodin.  It didnt help much as I was still constipated the entire time I was on the vicodin.

I never get tired_ nauseated_ itchy_ or dizzy on it. I guess Vicodin affects different people differently.  Also_ I took both Darvocet and Percodan for dental procedures and they made feel pukey before knocking me out.

Encountered withdrawal symptoms when dose wears off (headache_ anxiety_ severe depression_ spacey-headed_ confused),"Anyone with history of depression or addictive tendencies should think twice before taking this.  The pain relief was only moderate_ and the ""high"" feeling is short-lived and definitely not worth the depression/anxiety that follows once the drug wears off.

320, 5, 2 Herniated disks & Sciatica,Sometimes my nose with itch shortly after taking it_ and I get extremely hyper.,Vicodin 10/325 really works for me!  However_ I believe I've developed a slight allergic reaction to it as sometimes it makes my nose itch.  But the nose itching is worth the pain relief that I experience for hours after taking one.  It not only takes the pain away but also makes me very hyper and happy! (cannot take anywhere near bed time!)  I want to talk_ talk_ talk.  My husband laughs and calls me a sketch.  All joking aside though_ it does work for me_ but I can only allow myself to take them when I'm in extreme pain as this drug can be very addicting because I feel so good when not in pain.  I would not suggest this drug for anyone who has an addictive personality!,F,39,10  years,12/18/2007,Vicodin

324, 2, pain control for tonsillitis,itchiness_ depression,I'm very jealous of everyone who says this drug worked for them to reduce the pain. It helps me out for about an hour_ and I can only take one every 4 hours. It kicks it nearly 2 hours after I take it_ and wears off about an hour later_ and even for that one hour the pain is reduced to a level that is just hardly bearable instead of constantly searing. I have never taken any other narcotics so I don't know why I would have such a tolerance against this powerful drug. And the itchiness is unrelenting. I'm not sure about the depression_ but I cry uncontrollably from the pain_ and this is very out of character for me. Far from any euphoric effect other people have reported.,F,23,1  days,11/30/2007,Vicodin

I had heard great things about this drug so I was excited to try and get rid of my pain.  last night i took it for the first time after dinner_ and i was in a state of euphoria for hours.  i didn't feel anymore pain in my foot_ in fact_ it felt like there was a warm blanket around my foot (it was actually a cast).  I took one more pill before I went to bed_ and slept like an angel.  woke up happy and giddy that I had found the perfect pain killer_ so i popped another one at 7am.  i've been sick ever since.  can't get out of bed because i am dizzy and feel like throwing up.  haven't eaten much today because the thought of food makes me even more sick.  i am going to try cutting the dosage in half_ but i am hesitant since the nausea is overbearing and i w,F,36,2  days,10/25/2007,Vicodin

Even if I drink a ton of liquid_ I still have trouble uriniating.  That is the worst side effect for me. I have take vicodin after every surgery I have had.

If I take it during the day_ I can become extremely nauseous.,I have taken Vicodin many times over the years for everything from wisdom teeth being pulled_ post c-section_ low back pain_ etc.  I have never found that it really helps with the pain (maybe takes the edge off)_ but never makes it go away.  I've tried to inform doctors of this_ but they tell me that if Vicodin has this effect on me_ most other pain meds will as well.  I'd like to find out why I have this reaction.  Benadryl does the same thing.,F,35, ,9/20/2007,Vicodin
340, 1, knee surgery recovery,Itchiness_ insomnia_ constipation_ light-headedness and headache.,I took vicodin for a few days after knee surgery.  It was effective in relieving the pain_ although the side effects were generally undesirable.  The worst for me was not being able to sleep and having a slight headache during waking hours. The inability to sleep was not a wakeful alertness but more like a drug induced dullness.  I stopped after 3 days and started taking ibuprofen instead.,M,32,3  days,9/19/2007,Vicodin

Then after occasional use (and I mean occasional_ like one a week or less)  for a few years the helpful affect of it stopped.  Now if I am where I can't take the pain_ and I give in and take one (like once a month) I get the headache from hell about 48 hours later and it takes me 3 days or more to get rid of that headache.

I know doctors are sometimes reluctant to prescribe it because they're afraid you're ""drug seeking"" or you'll get addicted but it's never been a problem for me. I take it for 4-5 days and then don't want it anymore because of the constipation. I add more fiber to my daily nutrition shake and take a mild laxative which usually alleviates the constipation but I'd rather not have to do that so when the pain subsides_ out goes the Vicodin.",M,47,5  days,8/27/2007,Vicodin

352, 5, chronic pain_ then addiction,constant drowsiness_ loss of appetite. mind numbing. addictive.,for me_ taking it relieved me of any pain i had and numbed me out both physically and mentally. after too long of use_ i no longer felt the mind numbing efects_ so i upped the dosage. i attempted to lower the dosage but my mind was constantly racing and i found it hard to power down and sleep. heightened pain sensitivity also plays a factor. vicodin is a great drug. will work wonders. it is poor judgment that brings about my negative effects.,M,19,7  months,8/14/2007,Vicodin

354, 4, Shoulder surgery,Mild itching- slight constipation_ drowsy and light headed.,When I first started taking Vicodin_ it helped but made me mildly itchy (which benadryl solved) and VERY drowsy and light headed- nearly passed out when first taking it after trying to walk downstairs. It did relieve my pain greatly and helped me sleep substantially at night ( especially since pre-surgery i had chronic dislocation of my shoulder and got little to no sleep). Does cause VERY vivid dreams- had a large quantity of nightmares on the drug (which i NEVER have had problems with previously). If in moderate to severe pain- its wonderful_ but I would take it as little as possible. Very hard to focus while taking. Not worth it for long periods of time.

It is fairly easy to obtain through legitimate channels and fairly cheap. But you'll pay. Use it CAUTIOUSLY. In time the 1 pill you take will turn into 2 to cover the pain and give you the buzz you're craving.

But it does defintely take the edge of the pain.  With gallstones_ is much like giving birth.  I do not believe in removing organs unless it is life threatening_ so pain meds are the only way to go_ when necessary.  Advil or Mortrin simply to not have the kick necessary and both of those are much harder on your kidneys.I can understand people wanting to take this drug to ""get high"".   It is not really high_ but rather relaxed and content....and works better than any valium could.  You mind relaxes as your body does.  I am very content when first taking the drug.

I felt so good I wanted to call all my neighbors and tell them how good of a job they were doing. However_ it will impair your judgement_ make you cocky_ and completely lower your inhibitions. I said some really hurtful things to a close friend of mine not thinking it would offend them. It seemed perfectly acceptable at the time_ but looking back on it in sobriety it was entirely moronic_ I have lost this person as a friend. The happiness she gave me was way more intense then this drug will ever give me_ and I found I would need to take it just to calm down after this incident.

My toothaches are NOT as nearly as bad as my broken hand! I can sleep all night long. I only have a week supply. Since I only take one in a 24 hour period_ they may last 2 weeks. I may have to ask for more if Ibprophen 600mg does not work. But for now_that much ibprophen does work for me. And the cost was about 12.95-not bad.

I have never tried to obtain more of this drug after the initial prescription ran out because I'm sure I would become an addict if I had access to it.  This drug makes me feel contented_ happy_ relaxed_ like the whole world is ""right"".   I can remember being so happy washing all of the little baby bottles on zero sleep.  Each time my prescription ran out I didn't feel withdrawal symptoms_ but I was depressed that I couldn't have that good feeling anymore.  Life seemed a little less-good for awhile.

Regardless of my being ""good"" when it comes to taking these pills_ I am dependent and that makes me feel pretty bad_ but I am very honest with everyone about how much I take and how I feel about the drug.

When I try to take less_ I get worse pain than I started with and I'm desperate to take more vicodin because the pain is so intense. I also can't sleep without it. I can't function without it.

429, 4, Severely ruptured disc / back surge,Makes me itch all over! Trouble falling asleep. Took two one night and felt very high. Also hard on my stomach_ even when taken with food and/or an antacid.,Though Vicodin did not alleviate the pain when my disc was so severely ruptured (neither did steroid treatments_ Percocet or OxyContin) - but after emergency surgery (for the ruptured disc) it did help with pain quite a bit. I take it once in a while now (maybe once or twice per month) when I sleep wrong or pull a muscle in my back and nothing else helps. I've had no problems with addiction because it makes me itch too much!,F,35,10  months,12/6/2006,Vicodin

I did not drink_ then one day went to a BBQ had one margarita and woke up in an ER.  The level was so high I was immediately put in detox. It was awful. I stayed clean until 3 months ago when my Dr prescribed Vicodin for Restless Leg Syndrome.  I told her of my history_ which she basically blew off.

Works great on pain especially when taken with Ultram. Makes me a working machine. I feel no pain and can swing a hammer all day long with minimal neck pain.

Muscle cramps all over body if I go 30 hours without one.,I assume that I am physically addicted_ as I burn all over my body if I skip a dose at night_ but 1/2 a tab makes the burning stop. I have been taking this drug for a year for chronic and extreme pain in most of my large joints. Without V_ I wake every time I roll over in my sleep. Ppl are always begging me for pills_ it's embarrassing. I make an effort never to take more than 1 - 1 1/2 a day no mater what_ as I have seen what addiction does to people's lives and will not fall prey to that. I have never taken V during the day_ as it makes you fuzzy. Those of you taking it for the wrong reason and taking too much- your livers cannot handle that much Acetominophen_ you will end up with cirrhosis or in need of a new liver. Not worth it.

437, 2, Toothache,Nausea_ sleepiness_ uncontrollable shaking_ headaches_ loss of appetite,I have never taken a prescribed painkiller before until this.  After an hour or so of taking one pill_ t started to kick in.  At first I felt OKAY.  It makes you feel happy and giddy for a little while.  But then after a while_ you get very very tired and fall into a dead sleep.  As the day progressed_ I felt more and more nauseated and even started shaking uncontrollably.  It was the most awful feeling ever.  It did_ however_ help with the pain_ but with the other side effects_ it just wasn't worth it.  I can almost compare it to the feeling of a really bad hangover.  I will never use it again.,F,20, ,11/3/2006Email,Vicodin

439, 4, After surgery,Muscle pain in my left leg,I recently had sinus surgery and was on several related drugs afterwards_ including Vicodin. I noticed pain in a specific muscle in my leg which felt like tingling and numbness (as if my leg was falling asleep) which made it a little unfortable when trying to sleep.  I coincidentally stopped taking Vicodin for the pain around the same time I went through my supply of antibiotics. The leg pain went away afterwards. The other day_ I took some Vicodin that I had left over to help me fall asleep one night and found that the leg pain started again. This linked it to the Vicodin as opposed to any other medication I was taking or coincidentally pulling a muscle after the surgery. It wasn't a severe pain - more like sharp tingling - and it only effected a muscle above my kneecap. I won't be taking it to help fall asleep anymore. With that said_ I wouldn't hesitate to take it for severe pain for it was a godsend and it really helped.,M,27,15  days,10/17/2006,Vicodin
440, 3, Migraines,Quicker heartrate-- which I particularly noticed when trying to sleep at night.  I also need to take Ambien when using Vicodin for this reason.  Also itchiness in my legs-- also particularly noticeable at night.  Occasional nausea.,I find that if I have not taken this drug for a week or so_ it helps with the pain (for about 3 hours).  I only take one tablet at a time due to concerns about addiction.  If I have taken the drug recently during the past week_ it is not as effective (it neither relieves the pain much_ nor does it cause the euphoria many have noted).  It doesn't make me dizzy or impair my mental abilities.  When it stops working_ I lay off rather than upping the dosage.  This seems to work.  I take Demerol (meperidine) for some severe headaches that Vicodin does not fix.  I have not experienced the dramatic_ instantaneous pain relief that others have mentioned.  But_ then again_ I have taken a lot of over the counter pain medications over time_ and I believe this has interfered with the effectiveness of many drugs.  This drug has made me loopy if taken with alcohol (to be avoided_ but I had a migraine and was at my sister's wedding_ where the combination seemed obligatory).

441, 5, root canal,Decreased Libido_ dehydration_ trouble urinating_ trouble sleeping_ constipation,the drug certainly takes care of the pain but after a while now (1 year) I believe I am addicted. I have a very high tolerance taking 7-8 xtra strength pills at a time but I have always had a hight tolerance for just about anything. It does give me some dehydration especially if I'm being active_ shopping_ walking etc.  Unfortunately_ it also makes it difficult for me to have sex with my Girlfriend as I cant even achieve an erection_ and believe me ;I am a very sexual being. Sleep can be a problem as well as I need to take sleeping pills to sleep through the night. I work out regularly and V is starting to affect my workouts as I am groggy in the morning and not fresh & energetic. Not sure how long I will be taking vicodin because now it is just for pleasure but I sure hope it ends sooner than later,M,28,1  days,10/12/2006,Vicodin
442, 5, toothache,disburnces in sleep_ constipation_ drowsy in mornning,orginally taking it for pain in my tooth but now I can say I take it for the euphoric feeling I get. It definitely helps get rid of the pain but I soon found myself taking it for the warm fuzzy feeling and I become really outgoing. I take quite a bit: about 6-7 10000/mg at a time_ and I notice they are more effective on an empty stomach. I usually take them at night because during the day I concentrate on my job and also I Lift weights in the day and I don't want it to intefere with that. I can see that my tolerance is going up now and this can become a dangerous drug.,M,28,1  days,10/12/2006,Vicodin

But even though I was drinking lots of water_ I developed severe constipation and I had little appetite. Also had bad nightmares while on it_ and after I woke up_ itchiness under the cast on my arm that nearly drove me crazy.

Besides post op_ I have remained steady at 1 or 2 a day.  There are rare and wonderful pain-free days when I go without and I don't seem to suffer.  I have osteo-arthritis_ auto-immune related complete body aches_ chronic ear pain and recurrant ear infections and chronic face and skull pain...the list is long_ so I won't bore you further.

460, 4, Pinched nerve in back,Slight dehydration.  Slight drowsiness.,Vicodin has not provided the pain relief I had hoped for.  While it certainly has helped take the edge off_ I'd say it has only provided a 50-60% reduction in pain.  While this is certainly far better than what Ibuprofin has been able to do_ it has been somewhat of a disappointment for such a supposedly strong_ addictive medication.

It's been prescribed to me for a variety of things_ including when I've had dental work_ or a bad sinus infection (for the headache). It's the same every time. No pain relief. No happy feeling.

So real_ that when I awoke I thought that they were hallucinations (I have never done drugs_ so I don't know what a hallucination is like) - looked up side effects to see if hallucinations were a possible side effect from this medication - doesn't look like it.,I have taken vicodin several times before for a recurring rash (minimize pain so I can sleep).  This time I took it_ I must admit was stressful time of my life_ but the nightmares would happen the second I would fall asleep.  Then I would awake gasping with fear and try not to fall asleep again.  I would then dream I was in the same room (thinking I was awake) that someone was trying to kill me...so I would awake...each time_ not really knowing if I was awake or asleep_ trying not to fall asleep again.  I have never in my life had nightmares that were so REAL_ and that came on so SUDDENLY (the second I would close my eyes)...this happened all night_ and I will never take Vicodin again.,F,29,1  days,6/15/2006,Vicodin

Sleepiness a couple of hours after it wears off.,I have an old prescription that I never really needed for pain_ and when I get a massive migraine I take it.  At first_ my hands tingle.  Then_ I love everyone.  I love my family_ I love my life_ everything is wonderful.  I decided it would be wonderful to have another baby when I was taking this stuff.  Note - I DO NOT want another baby.  I get a little nausea.  I like Vicodin too much and think I could get addicted very easily_ so I only take them for really_ really bad headaches.

It's the first relief I've felt for a few days -- It felt mildly sedating which was nice because the pain made me anxious as well...Really took the sharpness out of the pain I was experiencing.,As a recovering alcoholic_ I can see why people like vicodin and the buzz it delivers.  Taken as prescribed it is effective; but a heads up -- I met quite a few people when I went to rehab for booze who were hooked on vicodin and other opiates.  This stuff ain't candy and detox is the worst thing you will ever experience in your life.

Wasn't sure if it was just me or maybe a reaction to the medication until I decided to ""google"" it... and found this website. It was interesting to find that many others suffered from this as well as more severe side effects_ too. I've only taken it for one day... so there isn't much for me to judge on_ but when I took it I hadn't eaten and it quickly made me feel very nautious. That side effect subsided as soon as I put some food in my stomach. I really wonder why its making me itch so badly.

Have not noticed actual hearing loss_ and only very minor ringing in the ears_ but it does produce a feeling of ""fullness"" in the ears.  Another side effect is jaw clenching/spasms.  You will find yourself tightening your jaw and neck muscles_ especially around the TMJ.  (Causes the ear pressure?)",This is a great drug for pain_ and it provides some pleasant side effects like speediness (makes you want to get work done_ clean your house_ etc.) and it elevates your mood.   I have not had any withdrawal symptoms_ though it is very tempting to take it more than you need to.  Tolerance begins to happen within 4-5 days of use_ but backing off for a few weeks will increase your sensitivity to the drug all over again.  Be careful and make sure to take days off here and there if you have to take it long term. I am concerned about the hearing symptoms_ though.

476, 1, Not just vics all opiates,none besides addiciton.... i wouldnt recomend anyone take vicodin unless taking it only for pain exactly as prescribed....and use precaution then....especially if you are known to have an addictive personality_ have mental or physical diseases_ or substance abuse......,i feel i have a severe addiction.....ive only been misusing opiates for about a year but ive done almost all of them including IV heroin_ oxycontin_ methadone_ vicodin_ morphine_ codeine_ darvocet and i feel i have all the symptoms of severe physicial and pyschological dependance.... the addiciton is so strong sometimes i cry wondering if ill ever be normal again....im gonna try suboxone soon....word of advice.....NEVER TAKE OPIATES IF YOU NEVER HAVE.  IF YOUR UNLUCKY LIKE ME AND OPIATES HIT U LIKE THEY HIT ME U WILL _NOT_ BE ABLE TO QUIT WITHOUT MEDICAL HELP_ DRUGS_ AND/OR REHAB.,M,17,1  years,5/16/2006,Vicodin
477, 2, post surgery,Gastrointestinal symptoms were dreadful -- cramps_ constipation (despite drinking water etc.) and nausea.,It relieved some of the pain_ but not worth it--I'd have to be desperate to try it again and willing to deal with the GI problems.  Unlikely to happen.,F,53,2  days,5/12/2006,Vicodin
478, 5, Neck and shoulder pain,Slight itching around my thighs_ but not too bad. I did feel pretty euphoric (no complaints)_ but it also makes me a neat freak (spent hours cleaning and organizing my apartment).,Wow.

480, 5, Herniated discs & arthritis in neck,The side effects are worth the pain relief. Without it_ I would not be able to work or play. I only take 2.5-3 p/day (7.5/750)--NEVER anymore than that. I most likely have a physical dependence since I've taken the same dose for about two years. But I know I'm not psychologically addicted (if I was_ I'd be wanting to take more); however_ most doctors have a problem prescribing it long term--even though it's obvious I'm not abusing the drug. My last doctor agreed to prescribe it long term. Question is: Why only her and not the others? Any comments from other chronic pain sufferers who use this drug? P.S. I used to take it with Oxycontin but I didn't like the idea of taking that drug so I detoxed myself off of it. I'm glad I did.,,F,52,2  years,5/4/2006Email,Vicodin

482, 1, dental pain,Terrible nausea & dizziness; simultaneously tired and restless.,Talk about the cure being worse than the disease. This drug is absolutely to be avoided if you have any nausea issues_ especially with things like codeine or anaesthesia. After just one capsule_ I felt like I was going to die! A real nightmare and I'm amazed by all the positive results other patients have had. Since it is so highly addictive_ just as well that I hate it so much.,F,39,1  times,4/10/2006,Vicodin
483, 5, spine/tissue injury in car accident,Did not experience any of the possible side effects at all -- no constipation_ no dependency_ no problems with sleep_ libido_ etc.  No undesirable side effects.  Was lucky_ since others I know have had nausea_ constipation_ etc._ and hate using this drug.  Usability seems to really vary from person to person.  IF it works for you_ it's great. IF not_ it's bad enough that most people seem to stop taking after first dose or two.,My family doc won't prescribe vicodin because of a concern re addiction.  But the ibuprofin_ acetomeniphen_ and then even Celebrex he woulkd prescribe caused serious gastro problems after a month of regular use -- and with very little pain relief.  Orthopedic doc prescribed vicodin. Great. Pain gone in 20 minutes_ relief lasted hours and hours_ no mental impairment_ just quick_ sure pain relief. Should have used  vicodin to begin with.     I LOVE vicodin_ too_ because it worked so well for me.  But I don't LOVE it meaning I want to keep taking it no matter what.  If I wasn't in pain_ taking vicodin was like drinking water -- no effect in terms of altering consciousness_ the reason people seem to want to use drugs regularly.  If I was in bad pain_ though_ it was a blessing -- I could work without being distracted by pain     _ and without any impairment of my mental acuity or wakefulness.***** The nature and source of the pain you want to relieve makes a BIG difference. *****,F,48,6  months,4/9/2006,Vicodin

487, 5, broken ankle_ toothache_,,Well_ I just want to let you all know my experience. It cured my pain most definitely. I was taking a bottle everyday for like_ 8 months and then stopped because it didn't work for me. So I started doing heroin_ the same thing as vicodin_ just illegal. Do you know how many heroin addicts there are that started taking vicodin? From vicodin there is oxycontin_ and past that is morphine_ at least in a legal order. did you know that the withdrawl from vicodin is the exact same as heroin? it's just as addictive. If you do take vicodin_ realize that you are taking a strongly addictive substance and take it exactly as prescribed_ for exactly as long as your doctor tells you. It may keep you from having to go through rehab someday.,F,23,5  years,3/2/2006,Vicodin
488, 4, complete extraction of all teeth,extremely vivid dreams in full color Vicodin dreamsThis dream was this morning about 4-5 am after taking 1⁄2 tab of vicodin at about 9;30 pm the evening before.These dreams are in full color and extremely vivid.It was day time with a blue sky and small white fluffy clouds_ there was a full moon at about 3 oclock (12 oclock) being the horizon line. There were 4 moons 2 on the left_ 1 in the center (the real moon) and 1 on the right. (O O   O    O  which looked like this.) I was trying to take a digital photo of this strange event with my camera ( I viewed this from both as a 3 party watching this and being in the event at different times with no notice of anything strange).I could not get a clear shot of the event because of telephone poles and wires and buildings in the way every where I looked. I was walking through a neighborhood in peoples yards and backyards looking for a vantage point to take the shot.A lady ( I dont remember what she,when we looked up into the sky we say a very large object that appeared to be a communication tower or pole that was metallic which went from right to left and took up most of the view of the sky. We thought this was quite strange then it turned into a large semi truck and trailer with a picture of said pole on the side that drove away to the left out of view which revealed the NASA building and the sky with an unobstructed view of the 4 moons.Next we (kitten and I) were inside the NASA lunch room at a round orange vinyl lunch table with a NASA guy sitting across from us. I think he had short dark hair_ was clean shaven_ average build and height but dont remember anything else (he may have worn black rimmed glasses but I dont remember for sure now) I asked him about the 4 moon phenomenon and he said it was called a Poon Moon he also had a scientific name for this but I either never got it or forgot it as soon as I woke up and was reflection of the one mo,M,48,1  days,2/24/2006Email,Vicodin
489, 4, DEQUERVIAN'S TENDONITIS,Loopiness_ Muscle Pain?,Not sure if the muscle pain was a side effect from the drug. I am in retail and a waitress (though I am hosting until my wrist heals)_ but my legs have never hurt so bad in my life. I have a weird_ dull but aching pain not only in my calves_ but in my shins as well as my thighs. But the Vicodin DID really ease the pain in my wrist. If you know_ or think that Vicodin can be related to the pain in my legs_ please e-mail me. In the mean time_ I just took another to see if it would relieve the pain in my legs.,F,20,2  days,2/22/2006Email,Vicodin
490, 2, UTI/Kidney infection/menstual cramp,The most vivid_ horrific dream of my life--every inner fear in my being came out in the dream_ and even after getting up two times and walking around and breathing I was dropped back into this nightmare. It was so real (I could smell and taste and feel when my blood ran cold in my dream)_ and I unfortunately remember it from start to finish...in fact_ I woke up still feeling like my blood was running cold and the air had been sucked out of the room. I spent the rest of the day terrified to sleep_ groggy_ depressed_ crying_ etc. Good news: no pain.,I have used this drug several times before_ but never before going to bed. It tends to make me a little woozy_ but I had never experienced the nightmare of taking it at night. Try it at your own risk.,F,23,3  days,2/22/2006,Vicodin
491, 5, treatment,Increased energy_ easier to fall asleep_ calmness_ anxiolysis_ increased sensation of pain_ increased sex drive_ tactile stimulation more intense,"At first I was taking it in a less-than-legal sense to find a good sleep aid. My reaction to it was highly paradoxical_ since it made me feel pain and think more clearly. I'm usually emotionally and physically numb_ and Vicodin reversed that. The doctors think I might be bipolar_ so I'm not sure how much those two have to do with each other. It lifted me out of depression and smoothed over manic episodes. Also_at times I have this ""wall"" blocking me_ so reality isn't real_ I can't really ""touch"" anyone_ and I'm generally disconnected. Vicodin made me feel normal and emotionally balanced. That was the most functional month of my life (socially_ academically_ emotionally etc.) Not sure why_ but it seems to have wildly different effects on different people_ especially in terms of mood.",M,19,1  months,2/20/2006,Vicodin
492, 4, tonsillectomy,LOWERED SEX DRIVE(numb- like feeling of penis if I had sex); constipation;,I loved how it quickly and easily took the pain away. It didn't last through the night however_ had to wake up within 5 hours of taking 2 5/500s and throat would be killing me. Sex drive was lessened a little but ejaculation was impossible and after having sex with gf after 30 mins or more I felt numbness in my penis. Besides that it was great. I took it as prescribed by the Dr. and I also made myself aware of how often I was taking it and stayed aware of addiction- like urges.,M,23,14  days,2/14/2006Email,Vicodin
493, 5, back and shoulder pain,constipation_ slight dizziness_ decreased sex drive_ decreased concentration and analytical thinking,Vicodin is great_ the constipation can be cured by drinking plenty of water especially in the morning. the only thing about V is that after taking it_ I really have no desire to have sex.  I usually take it in the evening_ gives me a warm fuzzy feeling_ and at that point I don't really need anything else_ I take 1-5 Extra Strength a day_ run a successful law practice. I never take it during the day_ it clouds my mind too much. It hasn't affected my professional life_ my evening social interactions have decreased mainly because I don't drink alcohol because it ruins the vicodin buzz. My wife knows I take it_ but she doesn't know how much or often. Hydrocodone is a godly drug_ but if you use it too long it will become part of your daily routine.,M,31,2.5  years,2/10/2006,Vicodin
494, 3, Endometriosis,Constipation and addiction.,I began taking this for pain from endometriosis and now I'm addicted to it and can't stop it without going into withdrawal. I now usually take more than my prescribed dose due to becoming tolerant and when I run out it's like a heroin addict not having their fix. I do not wish to be on it the rest of my life but can't imagine going off it.  It's a true opiate addiction_ much like heroin_ only not illegal if prescribed.  My advice it to only take it short term for a temporary pain problem. It does work well for pain.,F,39,2  years,2/6/2006,Vicodin

Extreme itchiness.,Didn't help with the pain whatsoever.  I don't understand all the hype surrounding Vicodin_ but it certainly didn't help me.

498, 5, Fractured Collarbone,Mild Constipation_ drowsiness. Both come with the territory and are to be expected.,This is a terrific drug! The pain I experienced from a broken collar bone ranged from moderately severe during the first few weeks after my injury_ to moderate_ in the time remaining it took to heal fully. Here's the situation: I'm home from the hospital_ pacing around the house holding my arm in the least painful position I can_ whining to myself as the broken ends of my collar bone rub against each other. I'm not able to think about anything else besides how much this thing is hurting. Then I take two 5/500 vicodins. 30-45 minutes later I am no longer holding my arm_ I am able to move my body around freely without pain_ and I have a big 'ole grin on my face as I relish the warm_ fuzzy_ pain free state my body now enjoys...for the next 4 hours at least.,M,25,2  months,1/20/2006Email,Vicodin

I'm having a panic attack and I'm freaking out. I have had nightmares from that pill before_ BUT NOTHING like this. I have seen many people take this drug for fun_ and i have taken it in the past.

The pain stopped in less than 5mins_ but I couldn't sleep and felt very hot_ sweaty and somewhat itchy and tingly. Woke up the next morning feelin nauseous and tired. Overall_ I don't like vicodin. I'd rather take Advil or Aleve for the pain. They don't work as well_ but at least I don't feel miserable.,F,21,2  days,1/3/2006,Vicodin

505, 4, Inguinal Hernia Surgery,Muffled hearing_ tingling skin_ slightly dizzy.,Works well for the pain if I take 2 tablets_ but that is when the side effects are more noticable.  1 tablet did not adequately control the pain.The muffled hearing is probably the most disturbing effect I exprienced.  Makes it difficult to talk to others_ especially with any back ground noise.,M,42,3  days,12/9/2005,Vicodin
506, 3, Broken Clavicle,Made me very drowsy but did help the pain.  After taking a Vicodin_ I would throw up when it was wearing off and the pain was returning. Also_ very itchy and constipated.  No appetite.,Didn't want it to affect my liver_ so I started alternating between Vicodin and Ibuprofen for the pain.,M,52,2  weeks,12/1/2005,Vicodin
507, 4, Back pain; arthritis,Some itching; slight nausea. Euphoria is a great side effect. Some irritability when drug effect wears off.,Some pain relief not as good as tylox but less constipation. A little concerned about addiction but this is such a subjective issue. I think I have control (don't we all)and watch dosage (no more than 2 per day usually 1 and sometimes 1/2). I think I am more psychologically addicted than physically in that I think about it a lot and rationalize why I use it when the pain is not great. Be careful and use dosage as an indicator of addiction.,M,59,3  months,11/29/2005,Vicodin
508, 3, Ruptured Discs in lower back,Mood swings_ inability to concentrate_ sweating_ nausea_ IBS.,Pain relief is adequate_ but side effects are almost as bad as the pain itself.  I take 5 per day (as well as a couple of Ultrams) as I suffer chronic sciatica.  I need a mulit-layer fusion surgery_ but am holding out for artifical disc implants.  On long weekeends_ I will ocasionally skip taking this medication to monitor myself for addiction.  So far I have not become addicted (but fear that it could happen) and don't need any more problems than I currently have.  I'm thinking that if you REALLY do have chronic pain_ that addiction is less likely to occur.,M,44,4  years,11/23/2005,Vicodin
509, 4, total hip replacement,Didn't start taking vicodin until the 3rd day after surgery; up to that point it had been two days on a morphine drip. The first side effect noticed was constipation_ which went on for five days. I eventually used an over the counter stool softner which really helped. Other symptoms have been drowsiness and blurred vision to the point that reading is a bit of challenge. I also experienced dreams so bizarre that they made 1950s Italian cinema look like Disney cartoons. That was helped by dropping the vicodin at bed time and switching to two tablets of extra strength tylenol_ on the surgeon's advice. He said be sure to allow four hours between the last vicodin of the day and the tylenol.,My impression is that vicodin lingers in the system. When I awake after as much as 10 hours of no vicodin my vision is still somewhat blurry. Right now_ about 3 hours after the last pill_ I need to squint to see the type here in focus. Also dreaming is still surreal_ but not nearly as intense (a contributor to the wierd dreams may be the mandatory lying on my back all night--a combination of restricted movement leading to nutsiness and me normally prefering to sleep on my side). But as a pain killer there are no complaints. As to the addiction factor_ it's wait and see. I sure don't feel any mysterious cravings_ though it will be a while yet before I go cold turkey.,M,60,17  days,11/20/2005,Vicodin

514, 4, Dental troubles,I didn't really notice any side effects. It might have made me a little tired but stopped the pain in a fairly short time after taking it.  I alternated taking the hydrocodone with Motrin to limit the amount of impact on my liver.  I would take one 5/500 pill every 6 hours.  But if the effects wore off sooner_ I would take two or three motrin to hold over until the next one.  If the motrin was working ok at the 6 hour point_ I delayed taking the next vicodin until I felt I really needed it.  On average_ I took 3 per day instead of the prescribed 4 to 6 due to the OTC Motrin.,I was using a generic called Hydrocodone/APAP 5/500 substituted for Vicodin 5/500.,M,46,5  days,10/27/2005,Vicodin

But the side effects and the feeling of being under the influence of a narcotic are not worth it. I would much rather live with the pain... and have complete control of my mental faculties_ than experience that 'doped up feeling' again.  I do not have an addictive personality or physicality toward any substance_ but my guess is that IF YOU DO have that tendency_ then I would not even start taking this very powerful narcotic.,M,45,5  days,10/22/2005,Vicodin

519, 4, Appendix removed,Itchiness all over_ dry mouth_ vivid dreams_ drowsiness_ euphoria_ relaxation_ sense of well-being and security.   Over time_ addiction.,"Worked fabulously for pain relief; creates a ""disconnected"" feeling so that pain is dulled. Also makes you euphoric_ which helps abate pain as well. However_ after the pain went away_ I began craving the euphoric effects of the drug. I would take them at night for the artificial happiness they provided_ as well as the relaxation/drowsiness that came with them so that sleeping was easier. The drug worked great; however_ it is extremely easy to become addicted to its euphoria inducing effect. Also_ over time you need more and more to feel the same effect. If you are given this drug_ only take it to kill the pain and THROW THEM OUT when you don't need them for pain relief anymore. It is highly likely that you will become addicted_ and you will begin craving it if you don't have it_ starting a vicious cycle that took me months to break.

529, 4, ACL Replacement / Surgery,Constipation_ Vivid Dreams and Overall Itching,I original starting taking Vicodon after I had my ACL replaced. After taking meds (after surgery) for about 3 days_ my pain let up and I quit taking regularly. I did take as need to relieve pain and while going through rehab on my knee. After a while_ my knee was starting to bother me more (from lack of mobility - I was working major OT at work) and I began to take more of the Vicidon frequently. It was to the point that I realized the I was suffering from depression and the pain meds were helping me hide some (I was really short with my kids - almost mean sometimes). I've never been someone to take pills_ much the less to abuse something. I final had taken so much of these that I had a reaction during a stressful situation at work. I'm smart enough to realize when enough is enough_ and flushed the remainder of what I had at the office. Be careful. Most any meds can be abused. I can't help but believe that some of the depression was brought on by the Vicidon. I've been off about 3 weeks and have felt better.,M,39,5  months,7/27/2005,Vicodin
530, 2, Tooth extractions for braces,Projectile vomiting within 1 hour of taking WITH FOOD!(The Exorcist anyone?)_ Drowsiness_ Flu-like feeling for a couple hours after taking and vomiting it back up...,I took it ONE time right after I got 4 teeth pulled for orthodonic braces...it must have worked but I couldn't tell you. I went to sleep. All I know is I didn't throw up. Later I TRIED to take it for other pain_ like pain from braces_ CRAMPS from HELL_ etc. and I tried twice WITH FOOD_ and I threw it up so violently_ that I am afraid to take it again. I may try and cut the pill in half so it is 250MG instead of 500MG...,F,24,3  days,7/27/2005,Vicodin
531, 1, IBS,extreme incredible itching on ankles and legs within half an hour of taking ONE pill... i left scratches on myself that took weeks to heal... and within 2 hours of taking_ i started vomiting so fiercely and intensely that i could not stop vomiting for almost 3 hours straight.  had a sore throat the next day from puking_ and could not swallow.  i had thrown up until i puked up bile and had the dry heaves_ and STILL would not stop gaggin.  i have never thrown up so violently in my life.  i would NEVER NEVER NEVER take this stuff again!,I know someone who was addicted to this stuff_ it happens quickly_ it makes a lot of people puke_ apparently.  Be careful! It makes some people hyper and zoned out at the same time_ i.e. feel like they can do anything_ not worried_ but this can lead to manic behavior (overspending_ other substance abuse combined_ impulsive decisions) and a HUGE crash when coming off -- depressed_ lethargic_ the shakes.  Like the DTs.  If you have a tendency to get addicted_ don't take Vicodin_ it's bad news.,F,35,1  days,7/25/2005,Vicodin

533, 1, back pain,Horrific dreams that would not stop. As a result_ I could not sleep. I suffered anxiety_ fearing the dreams would return. I don't have anxiety otherwise.,My back pain was very bad_ to the point where my doctor was discussing surgery. I had tried other pain medicine_ but none gave relief. However_ when I took vicodin_ my brain obsessed on absolutely horrific images mostly of mutilated children and the nightmarish dreams wouldn't stop. I poured the prescription into the toilet and flushed them. If you experience less extreme side effects that you can tolerate_ the drug might work for you. Otherwise_ for me_ I would much rather suffer the pain.,M,46,5  days,6/24/2005,Vicodin
534, 4, back pain,emotional_ felt sick like I had the flu when I stopped it. Had some crying spells in front of my girlfriend and doctor and know it has to be the drug. I was never like this before.  At first it was great_ I could sleep all night long and wake up feeling good. I did'nt seem to feel high but I was no longer depressed. It's good for pain_ but not worth the side effects and the danger to your overall health.,don't recommend it to anyone except for 1-2 weeks. It has too many side effects. There have been studies done that link it with hearing loss_ but to be fair the studies also said that happened to people taking large amounts over a long period of time.,M,55,14  weeks,6/20/2005Email,Vicodin
535, 5, dysmenorhea,Slight light headedness.  Sometimes drowsiness.,I took two of these in combo with Bextra or Vioxx for menstrual pain.    The very first time it removed all the pain_ made me drowsy_ and I slept for a few hours.  The next times it removed all the pain and made me feel a little floaty - not exactly dizzy_ but tingly and pressured in the back of the head.  It worked within 30 minutes and was wonderful for pain relief.  One pill was not effective_ though - I had to take two.  I would only use it for one or two days in a row_ though_ not long term.   I did not experience a high or euphoria or anything.  I don't know what exactly makes this stuff addictive..?  I just felt *great* because suddenly the pain was gone and I could get back to my life.  I also appreciated the lack of side effects... Not like that stupid Demerol.,F,27,1  days,6/2/2005,Vicodin

Diarreah_ shakes_ and I figure I could get through it but for what?  To remain in pain?  Hard choice to make and vicodin wins.,I am pretty sure I am addicted_ which is odd.  I tried to be addicted to many things but just don't have it in me; so I figured this would be the same.  However_ thats not the case.. so if forced to I am sure I could get off if my pain was GONE- but that won't be for a while_ I am doing epidurals in which I hope will help and least help me cut down on consumption.

I was hungry (hadn't eaten in 2 days because of tooth extraction) when I tried to eat_ became very nauseous.  I was super sensitive_ cried alot.

549, 5, Sever Back Pain,Side Effects differ from time to time. If I take a lot due to the pain_ lets say 3 750mg through out the day_ then the following day if I do not taking any by noon or 2-3pm then I will sometimes have a anxiety feeling in public or sometimes by myelf. It is hard to describe except shortness of breathe and the thought in the back of your mind that you are going to faint or something weird? I hate that feeling and it only lasts for seconds (45) at the most. Also of course constipation sine it slows your digestive tract down. You feel increased heart rate and ephoria sometimes when the vicodin releases into your system.,This drug has helped me out a great deal with my back pain. But of course these pills can not be good for you in the long run. I would rather have a bad back and live with the pain then die at a young age due to liver and organ problems. I have been taking for 16 months daily. I always have at least one 750mg in the morning about an hour or two after I awake then up to 3-5 throughout the day. I am now back to just one and fearing that I am messing up my body. My advice for anyone new to this pain killer is to try an alterative first. Perhaps Soma a muscle relaxer or motrin etc. The vicodin is a narcotic and you will eventually find yourself taking it for social reasons (going to the store to shop_ friends over_ etc.) to not feel the pain while doing these things and in a way to make it more enjoyable for yourself. My wife says that on occasion I have my moods I never had before. Short tempered at times and very irritable with the kids getting into everything when before I could care less? Everyone has a different opinion but for the most part_ if you don't watch yourself you may start taking this even when the pain isn't really that bad... Take it when you really have to!,M,27,16  months,4/11/2005,Vicodin

It helped me stop coughing so much but I found that it works extremely fast and makese me feel like my body is a sack of jello. I love_ LOVE_ love it! It is an understatement for me to say I have trouble sleeping so sometimes I take a tiny tiny swig of it and hop into bed and get an amazing nights rest. My whole life has been spent walking around in a haze because I can't fall asleep and have to spend the whole rest of the next day exhausted. I will run out of this soon and will have to go back to running 3 miles a day again to tire myself out but I am sure it is for the best since vicodin pills_ I'm assuming_ would be too dangerously addictive for me.,,F,25,2  months,3/14/2005,Vicodin

I have had problems breathing when it starts wearing off. Also just feeling lousy. Vicodin does not make me sleepy_ it keeps me awake to where I can't sleep. When I do sleep from taking it. It is not a restful sleep. I am actually sleeping but it seems like I am awake the whole time. Kind of like an outer body experience or something. I don't know_ but it's weird.

Five minutes after drinking even a small cup of water_ all of it had been returned to the cup. I'll take the pain instead of the vomiting and empty stomach anytime! I had to have an empty stomach before surgery_ so it was a total of about 2 days before I could eat or drink again.,M,18,1  days,8/13/2004,Vicodin
596, 4, Extreme abdom. Pain,None.. I agree with what everyone else has said. It seems to help with my attitude. I call it my happy pill.

Im only 25 and very afraid of what I might have done to myself and if I can ever really fix it..,,F,25,1  years,8/5/2004,Vicodin
