0, 3, Bipolar Disorder-II_ rapid-cycling,Extreme tinnitus (ringing in the ears),This medication has really helped me stabilize my mood. I have proven to be very hard to medicate and many more common therapies do not work for me. Experimental within the last year or two as a treatment for bipolar disorder_ my doctor and I decided to give this a try. Initially I had great results. But every 45-60 days I have had to increase my dose to continue it efficacy. At higher doses it seems to work but as it builds up in my system the tinnitus gets worse until I cannot hear out of my left ear. (It seems to be isolated to my left ear_ oddly.) When we lower the dose_ the ringing goes away_ but so does the efficacy. May be time to try something new. I do think this medication can help others as a mood stabilizer.,F,54,9  months1-2x20/10 3X D,9/22/2015,Nuedexta
