2, 3, Fibromyalgia,My first 2 weeks on Savella went very well. My pain was significantly reduced. I hoped that it would help with the fatigue_ which makes some days impossible to get through. It didn't help. At the start of week 3 I developed a very bad headache_ blurred vision_ pound heart_ pressure in my ears and my emotions were up and down. Feeling depressed_ anxiety_ sad and sometimes just a blank feeling_ which is the worst. On week 4 now and reduced my dosage in half. I will be talking with my RHEUMOLOGIST tomorrow. I really pushed my doctor to give me this medication. I was on cymbalta for several years_ it didn't do much for my pain but did help with depression and anxiety. I hope it's working for others but without all these side effects. God luck and God Bless,,F,47,5  days50,7/19/2016Email,Savella

Now_ at month six_ off Savella_ my blood pressure still high and taking blood pressure meds. Still have racing heart and sweats. Before Savella_ blood pressure was below normal to normal.

12, 2, Chronic pelvic pain,Heart palpitations (scary!)_ 17 lb weight gain while on meds (craved food ALL the time)_ higher bp.VERY expensive. My ins co stopped paying for it.,While medication did help with pain_ it was not consistent (from a 7 to 4/5/6)_ making me feel that it may not have been the meds at all that was causing my pain to be reduced. The heart palpitations_ cost and weight gain primarily led me to discontinue.,F,36,6  months100mg,3/5/2015,Savella
13, 5, For fibromyalgia pain,In the beginning dealt with a lot of nausea_ and pain until the dose was increased to 100 mg twice a day.

14, 3, Depression,Swollen prostate_ frequent urination_ sweating_ increased pulse and BP.,Good for social anxiety and depression in that it is a clean medication_ doesn't cause cognitive impairment as the SSRI's do.

For the last two years the combination has really helped my FMS symptoms of pain and cognitive problems. The best 2 consecutive years I've had in the last 20. Neurontin alone had worked in the past but eventually its effectiveness waned so my rheumatologist added Savella. The heart flutter and light headedness is bad enough that I'm backing off of the Savella.,M,48,2  years75 MG 2X D,9/13/2014Email,Savella

I started on the sample pack from the doctor's office. My symptoms began the day I took the 50 mg dose. Severe vomiting and diarrhea. My doctor told me to wean off the drug. I took my last dose of 12.5 mg yesterday. I will NEVER take this medicine again. I would rather suffer daily flares then swallow a Savella pill.

I feel a little bit on edge as far as my temper but not much different than when I was enduring all the pain with onlt tramidal for pain.,I do feel as if it has helped with the pain. The pain is still there but seems to be much less intense. Would  continue on this medication except my insurance company is telling me I need to try something cheaper & this drug is not in their plan. My Dr. is going to talk to her drug rep. & see if they can help in some way. Would like to stay on this med at least untill I retire next year.

21, 5, Fibromyalgia,No side effects at this point.,I've been on the highest recommended dose (100mg twice per day) for about 2 months. Prior to that_ I started with the tiration pack_ and took that for 2 weeks. Then_ my dr. increased my dosage slowly_ to 50 mg. twice per day. I took that dosage for about a month_ and I didn't notice any decrease in my pain. My dr. explained that it usually takes about 2 months (on the highest dose that will work for you) to start feeling relief in pain. I tried to be patient. Now_ after being on a total of 200 mg. per day_ my fibro. pain has greatly diminished. I still have pain_ but it's gone from a level 10 (horrible_ horrible pain...can't function) to a level of 2 (still have numbing_ aching pain_ but I can live with it). My pain was where it was greatly effecting my quality of life_ and I literally didn't want or feel like doing much of anything. I was on Lyrica for about five months_ and Lyrica worked at first_ but after four months_ it completely stopped working for me. Savella has been a lifesaver for me. For those of you who cannot afford the Savella_ please go to the Savella manufacturers website and go to the Patient Assistance area. You can get Savella for free_ if your income qualifies.

22, 1, Fibro & CFS,Severe memory loss_ 3 times I was driving down the road and had no clue where I was_ who I was or where I was going. And I had my 6 kids in the van with me. Very Scary! I still have memory problems today.Other problem_ tingly scalp_ nausea_ cramping_ hot flashes_ increased heart rate and blood pressure.  I had really bad mood swings_ went off on my children for no reason.  I felt jittery_ had my 1 and only ever panic attack on this medicine.,Helped with my pain a bunch. Normal pain level a 12 on a 1-10 scale. While on meds I would say a 3-4.  I felt like I had energy again_ but.  The side effects were WAY too BAD!,F,34,2  months50 mg 2X D,7/27/2013Email,Savella
23, 2, Fibromyalgia,Headaches_ nausea_ heart pounding_ crying spells_ agitation_ insomnia_ sweating. Unfortunately_ these side effects were severe enough that I had to stop taking this medication. It was effective for joint pain and stiffness_ but the side effects were just too much.,,F,46,2  months50mg x 2,7/2/2013,Savella
24, 1, Fibromyalgia,I had the worst case of constant sweating & at night soaking my Bed.,The only reason I took Savella was because it is an approved Fibromyalgia Drug.- I am already taking Lyrica_ which took a while to find the right dose_ so that I no longer wake up in the morning and my hands and feet do not work (As though I have severe Arthritis in my extremities). I started feeling well on the 1st dosage of 50mg 2xday_ but kept going higher until I was at 200mg 2xday_ which gave me no more relief and caused weird side effects_ so I stopped taking it_ only to find out that I really needed it. I now take 100 mg 2 x day and it works great with no side effects.-3rd drug is Cymbalta_ of which I am in need of to stop Depression and some pain. -Summary; Savella may work for some_ but the side effects outweighed the Pro's for me taking this drug (of which I feel more than likely works for many others). I however_ take Lyrica & Cymbalta to function & continue working. I have found through my very rare Family Doctor who specializes in Fibromyalgia (Dr Janet Ciarkowski) the exact comination of medication that works for me.,M,46,2  weeks20? 2X D,3/24/2013Email,Savella

I felt weaker and more tired than usual when I took this medication.,I haven't found side effects like this anywhere else_ so it is possible that this is just a strange side effect isolated to me.,F,26,7  days30MG 1X D,11/23/2012Email,Savella

I have been on medicines throughout my life and never felt the way I did. I forgot where I was driving (with kids in the car)_ blew up on my son who did nothing wrong_ cried and was sick. It was horrible. My heart was racing_ I was clammy and just couldn't function. I almost went to the er.

I was first on cymbalta_ which was ok_ so I thought_ then my Dr switched me to Savella_ huge pain relief! I had a brief experience after about a year of taking it where my Dr switched me back to cymbalta_ and the pain was unbearable! Within weeks of switching again to savella I was again pain free (minus the occasional flare-up).

35, 5, Chronic joint and muscle pain,I started with 15 mg a day for a week and they 15 2X a day for a week 25 and 15 a day for a week. 25 and 25...25 50...50 and 50 a day. My dr had me start very slow because of the side effects and it helped. I would get nausea about 90 minutes to 2 hours after I took the pill and my heart raced and I could not sleep at all. I also noticed I was short of breath and if I did anything that took effort (mowing the yard) I could not catch my breath. It would take about 4 to 5 days for my body to get use to it and then it was time to does up again.  I also lost about 5 pounds and my body felt flushed. After two months of the pill the my side effects are gone except the shortness of breath and I dont require as much sleep as I did before. I do notice if I dont eat at regular intervals I get nausea but if I eat it goes away.,It took my pain away!!!!! I have been dealing with pain since I was a teenager and the last few years it has taken away my life. This medicine has been amazing even with the crapy side effects. It was scary as hell that first month with my heart racing and being short of breath ( I even went to the hospital one night because of chest pains) but it was worth it. What is one month of hell compared to a life that is pain free. I have more energy_ I am happy_ I am motivated to live again. I fixed my garage door after I replaced a leaky faucet all on the same day!!! I feel amazing. I am hoping with time the short of breath goes away.

37, 1, Bipolar/chronic pain,Wow so taking this medicine was one of the weirdest experiences I've ever had. At first I was incredibly nauseous and felt like I had to burp or I'd throw up. Then I got incredibly irritated. I just wanted to bitch to everyone about how I felt cause honest I felt sick at first. Not to mention my body was so hot. Then I felt so wide awake and couldn't stop laughing uncontrollably. Literally_ I couldn't stop laughing and nothing was funny. I had to actually try not to laugh. During this time I had so much energy I was debating doing a workout video. lol Finally the laughing wore off but was still wide awake. I dont know what the hell my doctor was thinking putting me on this medicine. Its stupid.,I was supposed to take this medicine twice a day. Basically if I did I'd be a nutcase that couldn't function. This was terrible for me and did not react will to my mental disease. Made me incredibly manic so I couldn't sleep. Finally I surrendered and had to take my saphris.

To update: The cfs problems returned within 2 days of ending Savella.  Now I'm on Norco 5mg_ twice a day_ one in morning and one in the afternoon.  It does a good job of knocking out the pain and fatigue.  I know people go nuts when you mention using an opiate because of the addiction potential.  They need to back down.  I intend to stay on the Norco as long as my m.d. allows.,,M,62,6  weeks50mg 2X D,5/11/2012Email,Savella
39, 5, CFS,Savella did wonders for my CFS.  It knocked out 90% of my fatigue problems.  But I had to get off it.  It substantially increased my heart rate.  The blood pressure went up_ too.My cardiologist wanted me off it.  I'm on a pacemaker so I have a danger of other heart problems so there's no need to aggravate my heart.,I'm hoping against hope that the CFS doesn't return. Savella is a good drug for CFS.  I_ unfortunately_ had a side effect that wasn't tolerable.,M,62,6  weeks50mg 2X D,5/9/2012Email,Savella
40, 2, fibromyalgia,When I started Savella_ I had hot sweats_ nausea_ vomitting_ a great deal of anxiety and worst of all an increase in blood pressure.  I went up to 100mg because I was not seeing any benefits_ but the side effects were much too severe.  I had to be started on a second blood pressure medication to even be able to tolerate a 50mg dose.  Due to the bad side effects_ I decreased again to 25mg.  That had much less side effects except for my blood pressure.  It seemed OK for a while but my blood pressure became very unstable and my doctor took me off of Savella due to the high risk of stroke or death from high blood pressure.,I think savella wants to blame peoples blood pressure reactions on SSRI antidepresants being taken with it_ but I think the Savella itself is a high risk drug for high blood pressure without them.  It did help_ but is not worth the risk of death.  I wonder how many people it has killed or caused a stroke in.  I predict it will eventually be taken off the market.,F,48,8  months25mg 2X D,5/1/2012,Savella
41, 3, Tension Type Headaches,Extremely lethargic_ irritation on small things_ major side effect was my inability to pass urine properly. Severe lower abdomen pain_ with back pressure.,I've had TTH for 5 years now_ I switched from clonazepam (Klonopin) to Savella as a trial drug. The medication definitely was working on the receptors and I was feeling much better. I had less frequent headaches_ no unilateral dispersion of pain on the right side of the head. Although the side effects of the pain in the groin and lower abdomen compelled me to stop taking this medication. If women are not having the same problem_ this might be a better drug for them. After 1 week of taking the medication_ I returned to my normal routine_ and I experienced severe pain in my legs_ pain in my chest_ shortness of breath_ dry nostrils_ I wanted to go to the rest room_ but then I could not pass any urine_ which made my body go cold.,M,27,1  weeks50 2X D,4/24/2012Email,Savella

I felt like my head was going to explode.  I went to the ER immediately and was diagnosed with Seritonin Syndrome_ which is life threatening.  I was told by the ER doctor to never take this drug again and that she has seen this syndrome with serval other patients recently.,This drug is new and not widely researched.  When combined with other types of SSRIs it can cause serious_ sometime irreversable effects.  There needs to be more studies on this drug.  MD's need to have more information regarding interactions of this drug with other drugs one may be taking.

51, 4, FM_ herniated disk pain_ arthritis,After 3 months -- 50 mg Savella helped reduce the overall pain threshold dramatically (though it did not get rid of it entirely). I titrated to full dose slower than recommended to avoid side effects.  I believe that helped. It has helped considerably -- and allowed me to get back to my life.  The side effects (headaches_ heart_ BP_ urination_ etc) were significant but most minus heart issues went away in 3-6 weeks (because of the heart issues I was going to stop taking it  -- bad and pretty scary -  but because of pain relief I didn't want to stop). The heart issue side effects stopped at 2 1/2 months. Most people won't see it through long enough to see the side effects disappear.  So glad I did.,,F,54,3  months50mg 2X D,10/23/2011,Savella

In fact_ there has been a huge increase in pain to the highest pain level I experience (it constantly feels like it used to feel only after a day of substantial over-exertion).

Savella enables me to live a much more active and ""normal"" life_ I am no longer a slave to FMS or to painkllers. Sadly at 130.00 a month I cannot afford it without insurance and after 9 months of taking half a dose to stretch it out (since insurance went away) I am weaning off it. The weaning is bad and my FMS symptoms are through the roof...I even took a full pill tonight just so I can be mobile to bake my sons birthday cake and not be so foggy headed tomorrow. I am hoping a low-cost clinic will help me...soon_ because I cannot live like this.  Honestly Savella gave me my life back and now finances preventing me from getting Savella are taking my life away again :(  One warning is to check drug interactions CAREFULLY_ I can't even take cold medicine and I was taking tramadol (Ultram) at first and ended up with seratonin syndrome and nearly passed out at my kids' birthday party in 2009. Luckily I made the connection_ went to drugs dot com for the interaction checker and realized what was wrong and called my doctor right away.

I could say I had hot flashes_ but I was 52-53 at that time. That's called menopause. Many sides effects I could have attributed to the Savella were in reality caused by other things.,I went off all my meds(oxycontin_ etc.) in 2008 to go on the study for Savella. Unfortunately I got the placebo. I literally almost died. My BP shot up to 210/120 for 8 months. I was totally bedridden the whole time. I went on Lyrica and gained 50 lbs. in 5 weeks_ plus it did nothing for the pain. Then my kidneys shut down. Finally by June of 2009 Savella went on the market. I could feel a difference in 1-2 weeks. I went on the highest dose fairly quick because my pain is so severe and causing other health problems. Just remember it is not a pain pill. It will not get rid of ALL the pain. It will not work for everyone. Nothing man does will get rid of this illness. You will have to listen to your body to help manage your pain and other symptoms. And most of all_ if you have fibro_ as I have for 25 yrs._ realize that everything you do will have a consequence to your health. Fight the urge to be overly focused on the pain. I have been on just about every drug and holistic pill there is. Savella hasn't gotten rid of all my pain_ but it has worked the best for me.

I am on BP meds and had to have them increased.  Constipation is tolerable_ it has to come out eventually!  I have noticed that I have nausea if I miss my stomach meds.  But the one thing that I am happy to tell you is that I cannot remember when i felt this good_ probably at least 15 years.  I still have pain in the morning but it is nothing like before.  I can put up with the side effects because it helps me to live a normal life.   Before Savella_ I didn't want to live if I had to be in constant pain.  It works for me.

But I get a lot of severe pain.  I use Soma mostly for my muscle spasms.  I try to keep my meds down to as low as I can tollerate without being too on edge of pain.  I have gastritis so taking pills is no fun.  Yes_ I know how to take these pills properly.  I went from getting obese from Fibro to now being skinny.  I'm having difficulty keeping weight on at times.  Like right now.  I'm off the Savella because my heart pumping madly drove me nuts and felt awful not to mention light headedness and out of breath_ as mentioned.  Since it did nothing positive and did do somethings negative_ I went off of it slowly.  I can take none of the other pain medications out there and am really ticked off that I can not have my Darvocet.  I am now on the Gerson Diet.  It is extremely difficult.

I was recentely told to down grade from 50mg 2x a day to 50mg once a day to see if that helps my symptoms. The constipation is better ( Thank goodness! )... But the insomnia is still there and as for the sweating_ well_ even my sweat sweats. I want off it but the doctor said to give it about 3 months....

96, 4, Fibromyalgia,Hot flashes_ sweating and a bit foggy headed at first.  High blood pressure and Tachycardia. Decreased sex drive and sensation.,The side effects I encountered with this drug are very unfortunate because it actually works for the pain !  I was ready to put up with the lesser side effects until the high blood pressure and tachycardia developed.  This happened a week into the full dose after titration.  I'm wondering if maybe the 12.5 mg twice a day would work.  Going to rheumatologist next week.  Savella works_ but_ not at the risk it caused me.,F,44,3  weeks50 mg 2X D,8/6/2010,Savella

Will be calling my doctor tomorrow to get off of this medication. Seriously_ when the side effects are worse than the illness_ why take the chance! Especially of concern to me was the huge jump in heart rate (to nearly dangerous levels). Please do your homework before starting this and/or other meds...I do not think doctors and drug companies care WHAT the side effects are.

101, 2, Fibromyalgia,increased brain fog_ increased GERD symptoms_ fatigue_ dizziness_ shortness of breath_ increased heart rate_ sweating and chills_ rash inside mouth,I was so disappointed that I had to discontinue Savella_ because I read that you just have to stick with it to get past the side effects. I was really willing to keep going until the rash in my mouth. That's when I figured it was time to call it a day.I've had fibro for 8 years or longer. I am usually an active person (even with fibro)_ but the Savella slowed me down to almost a grinding halt. Can't think straight_ can hardly keep my list of chores organized in my head. I've had to double my PPI dosage_ and the sweating is as bad as menopause (so I'm told_ because I've not yet gone through that).I'm glad that it's working for some folks_ sad I'm not one of them.,F,52,3  weeks50mg 2X D,6/11/2010Email,Savella

Followed by headaches and sexual dysfunction (urethra pain?),"It has been very hard to stay on the ""full"" dose_ and with Dr.'s permission have been adjusting dosing_ however effectiveness goes down on lower doses and side effects stay about the same - so no overall benefit. Seems my best day occurred 2 days after quitting ""cold turkey"" from the ""full"" dose where joint pain was gone and I had no lingering side effects. Lasted a few hours and then I was ""slammed"" with the old joint pain.",M,39,6  months50mg 2X D,6/9/2010,Savella

104, 3, Major Depression,Nausea_ Dizziness_ Lightheaded_ spaced out_ increased anxiety and panic_ blurred vision_ mood swings_ melancholia_ high pulse rate_ shortness of breath_ Upper respiratory tract infection like symptoms_ excessive sweating_ hot flashes,Very shaky start up effects - anxiety and panic increased_ felt an ominous fear all the time_ mood swings and irritability_ sometimes subtle euphoria and sometimes severe malaise and dysphoria. I think this drug is very dose dependent because of its very short half life of 8 hours. I felt disadvantaged because unlike other SNRIs like Effexor and Cymbalta there are almost very few patient ratings and information on use of Milnacipran in treatment of MDD.Side effects felt: Nausea esp first few days and when taken without food.Dizziness and lightheadedness_ feeling drunk and spaced out.Blurred visionHyper-emotionality mainly towards melancholia and sadness.Sleep - improved_ but dreams are sometimes very lucid.Tachycardia - pulse upto 120 bpm_ dyspneaUpper respiratory tract infection like symptoms - post nasal drip - sore throat_ and nasty mucous - but without fever - which actually makes GPs treat it as allergy.Jittery_ nervous and spaced out - especially in the evening when the effects kick in.This drug has apparently helped those who have failed ECT which should make it quite efficient_ but I would suggest this to be definitely not the first line of treatment for MDD_ and should perhaps be reserved for depression with anhedonia and apathy_ not for melancholic depression.Probably its too early for me to have a definitive view.,M,30,20  days25mg 1X D,6/3/2010,Savella

Just lost my mother 3 yrs ago so this is devastating.  I can't distinguish between the pain that I have and my abnormally high ANA results or just plain depression.

108, 5, FMS,HBP_ disorganized thinking_ irritation and impatience_ high levels of joint an muscle pain with each dose increase for about 3 days,My husband and I are both on Savella for FMS.  I tend to be depressed and anxious_ he tends to be depressed and flat in affect. I started 2 weeks before him.  I had high blood pressure_ and the other side effects mentioned but stuck with my dose.  He had high blood pressure and the same side effects; but he went back down to 12.5/day on his dose. He is coming off Cymbalta 10 mg qd.  He ran out of Cymbalta and two days later started taking Savella at 12.5 qd. 5 days later he went to 25 qd. His blood pressure and heart rate increased. Instead of moving to twice a day dosing_ after 2 days he opted to cut his dose to 12.5.  His BP has remained high with the reduction. He is having a lot of memory issues and his pulse is 102 compared to a normal level of 68. I am on twice a day dosing at 12.5 per dose and am feeling much better.  If I am late on my dose_ I feel agitated and hyper_ though.I put my gender down as male since I am mostly reporting on my husband.

They were intense; my fibromyalgia is worse.  I decided I could deal with nausea if the pay off was going to be pain reduction.  I took tons of fluconazole for the yeast infection which lasted a week. I still take generic zrtec for the all over itching.  My sore gums lasted a couple of months_ but I found if I took my medication as near 12 hours apart as I could get_ the better off I was.  I was pain free for six weeks_ then I started feeling some old familiar pangs.  My PCP added Lyrica in case I was headed into another dark period.  The side effects for it have been much harder_ more severe.  Savella helped me be and feel clearer than I had been in years.  I felt like me again.  I'm hoping once I adjust to the Lyrica_ the Savella will still do that for me.,F,41,3  months50mg 2X D,4/26/2010Email,Savella

Savella has been pretty bad.Before starting Savella_ I have lost almost 100 pounds_ due to dieting and going to bed hungry_ that is just what it takes for anyone in my family to lose weight or stay the same.I once took Lyrica and it added about 40 pounds onto me. I went off it and started on CYmbalta.I heard it blocked REM sleep_ that is really not good.I searched the net and found conflicting info on the topic. My doctor said not all people's REM sleep was affected by it.I didn't gain back any weight on Cymbalta_ in fact_ it may  have helped keep it off. With Savella_I have had dry mouth_ been depressed and in a bad mood.I have had this feeling of doom in the pit of my stomach that will not go away_ even when I'm ""having fun and laughing""_ it's still there!It seems to not even be connected to me_just a general feeling of impending doom.I read on another post the same feeling and couldn't believe someone else was",I couldn't believe that people wrote they have lost weight on Savella_ but i guess it's because we all have different body systems that react differently to meds. Wish I could find one to get rid of the pain and help with weight loss_and give me all my REM sleep! I'm giving Savella another week if I can stand it that long.The pain was worse today than it has been in a very long time.I would rather die or lose REM sleep than gain back another ounce of weight.

Panic is gone and it feels good to feel good. the pain was completely gone before i had to stop. the doctor said to expect severe rebound pain_ this has me almost as worried as the panic attacks. we will try some other medications in two weeks_ i am not looking forward to the other possiblities and their side-effects.

Now_ it's just a bit of occasional nausea when I first wake up or if I take it without food.,"This does ""take the edge off"".

I lost 15 lbs without even trying_ kept 10 of them off.  Switched back to old meds because Savella didn't control the pain nearly as well.

This sweating was so severe_ it was like having a slow-dripping faucet above my head.  I'd get a hot flash_ followed by a new round of sweating.  This sweating does NOT stop.  It was from my head to my ankles.  The cool air in my house would hit my skin and I'd go crazy--FREEZING to death!!  I had to stay in bed all day.  I never thought that sweating could be a dibilatating condition.  I'm glad it's over.  I lasted 8 days on Savella.

The scalp burning was terrible. I also had crying episodes. The good thing was the pain was decreased by 85-90% until the 2nd week of 25mg/day. Ended up in the emergency room with Seratonin syndrome (HR 180_ BP 180/98_ extreme agitation_ etc.) Was told that this could have killed me.

After three months of taking Savella_ I started self-destructing and cutting myself. I don't know why or anything_ but it does similar to prozac where it makes you think and do weird things. This is a newer drug and there is so much hype_ but it does not do anything at all for pain. I was not depressed and did not need a antidepressant_ but Savella made me want to die. It was so weird. Other than that there was no real side effects but there were hot flashes and fast heart beat. Be care with this one please.,F,40,4  months,12/22/2009,Savella

Once I found the right dosage for me_ it has helped alot with the pain & fog. As mentioned I have had some mood changes with it_ and am currently adjusting the dosage again to see if that improves.

127, 4, Fibro,Occasional headache_ hot flashes_ weight loss,Aweful side effects for first week_ then disappeared mostly. Hot flashes and sweating were common at first_ then only occasional episodes. Pain is still here_ but not as bad as before taking it. Lyrica was good for pain_ but the minimum dosage still left me with too many heavy side effects. Savellla worked for 50 mg twice a day_ but increased another 50 to make it 150 mg a day. It is better on the higher dose though_ and may ask for the maximum of 200 mg a day because my body metabolizes drugs faster_ as shown through blood levels_ so it takes a higher dose for me. When I increased to 150 mg a day_ the side effects increased temporarily and now is back to just occasionally again. I think it is a great medication_ but it still does not take away all the pain. Nothing has taken away all of it though. Give it a chance_  because I never would have found out that it was a steady and stable drug if I didnt stick it out the first week or so--especially with the terrible sweating and hot flashes. Thank goodness they disappeared_ at least for the most part.,F,38,4  months,11/9/2009,Savella

I still have some side effects_ high blood pressure and headache_ but the fibro pain is so much better and I can't remember the last time I slept so well.  For me_ the drug makes me sleepy so I have not had to use the flexeril since starting the savella.  If you have been through many drugs like myself for fibro_ give Savella a chance.

However the hot flashes and sweating became extreme after taking two 50mg doses a day.  The rash is most likely from the sweating.  The doctor cut my dose in half and its day 4 of the reduced dose.  I feel terrible. The pain has increased everywhere in my body.  I feel dizzy and I'm having nightmares.  I rode out the side effects of the titration period and really thought this was a great medicine until now.  Hopefully my body will adjust to the lower dose and I'll still be able to see some benefit since all of the other fibro drugs don't work for me.,F,42,45  days,10/21/2009,Savella

Once in a while I will get a sweat for no reason_ but its rare. It took away a lot of my pain_ although nothing has ever done anything 100 percent for fibro. Out of all that I have tried_ Savella is the best_ with the least side effects. I felt more mobile and less pain throughout my body. I am on 50 mg now_ but I will ask for an increase to 100 mg_ the max per day_ because I feel it working real well. Since there are almost no side effects after the first few days_ I can tolerate Savella real well. I just hope that 100 mg will not give me side effects. This new drug has potential.

But_ I read to stick it out_ and boy am I glad I did! I also have vivid dreams.  I really haven't had dreams in such a loooong time.  The only real side effect is occasional constipation!! And randomly I have had an eye twitch for the last week...not sure if that is from the savella tho?,I take it on an empty stomach.  First thing in the morning and earlier in the evening(I take half a 10mg Flexeril_ so sleep is no problem).  I feel like I am 75% better with pain and my muscle twitches have almost(except for the eye twitch) completely stopped.  It is not perfect_ but_ I feel pretty great.  I wish it could work like this for everyone.  On a side note: my insurance took quite some time to approve my coverage for this_ so I had to only take 50 mg per day for about 4 wks_ I think that helped with my tolerance and side effects alot.

Still have some fatigue_ though.,Drugs.com has a drug interaction check_ and there are many meds that can't be taken with Savella-- including Ultram. If you are taking it_ please do yourself a favor and check for interactions.,F,,2  weeks,7/9/2009,Savella
140, 5, Fibromyalgia,FIRST WEEK: nausea_ headache_ nervousness. TAKE IT WITH FOOD - AND TAKE IT EARLY IN THE MORNING AND BY MID-DAY_ OR IT WILL KEEP YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT. Give it at least two months for it to fully kick in & work properly. It isn't an instant fix - and it is nothing like Lyrica! Lyrica is poison. Savella gives real hope to fibro sufferers - if taken correctly!,Savella works great. But the first week of side effects while titrating are a bit uncomfortable. After that_ it's GREAT for energy_ pain & brain fog_ although it takes a couple months to see dramatic improvement. IGNORE any reviews from people who stopped taking it after the first week_ because they most likely did not take it properly and just are not giving it a real chance to work. Savella is not a pain pill; it does not work instantly. Very important to remember: TAKE SAVELLA EARLY AND TAKE IT WITH FOOD; always take it with food. I take it at 5 a.m. & 2 a.m. (for 7 weeks now). If not taken correctly_ it'll cause headaches/nausea. Don't give up; just give it at least two months to work.I take my doses halfway through my meals. If you take the second dose too late in the day_ it will interfere with sleep. The second dose should be taken before 2 p.m.Unfortunately_ doctors also aren't telling patients that because Savella is an SNRI_ it SHOULD NOT be taken w/ other antidepressants or it'll make you sick (serotonin syndrome). Take it properly & give it a chance - because Savella helps A LOT for fibro sufferers! Wonderful for pain_ energy & fibro fog.,F,38,7  weeks,6/16/2009,Savella
141, 5, Fibromyalgia_ depression,None.,This has helped me TREMENDOUSLY with my fibromyalgia pain and depression. I haven't felt this good since before I had my two children.

142, 4, Fibrromyalgia,High blood pressure developed after 14 days.,Other than HBP_ this drug helped me more than anything I have ever taken. I feel like myself again.,F,42,30  days,6/9/2009,Savella
143, 2, Fibromyalgia_ depression,Started out on the tiration dosage pack of 12.5 to 50 in 3 weeks_ the first week was great_ the second week great_ then the third week hit me and I literally could not get out of bed_ I had extreme tiredness and fatique unlike anything I have ever had and I am a very active Mother of four_ four grandchildren a gardener_ etc.  I stopped cold turkey when I read the precautions included calling a Dr. immediately if extreme fatique or tiredness happened.  My Dr. was out of town.  I need a drug to help me_ I have tried sooooo many and need one_ I take Tramadol for pain_ (I believe it is the best antidepressant out there) and Xanax for anxiety.Good luck  on Savella_ I had such hopes for it_ maybe if I went back to the initial 12.5 twice a day it would help?,,F,55,1  months,6/9/2009Email,Savella
