0, 5, Heart Failure,None,I have no complaints whatsoever with this medication_ it has been a Godsend for me thus far. I was experiencing extreme fatigue with even the slightest amount of exertion_ could only walk very short distances_ and had to sleep in a recliner because I couldn't lie down flat because I'd have trouble breathing. Coreg removed all of those symptoms_ this week I started a daily walking routine and can now do a whole mile without being exhausted. I plan to increase that distance soon. I am extremely satisfied with this medication.,M,49,1  months39 mg,5/26/2016Email,Coreg

In May 2014_ I was rushed to the ER having threatened a stroke and going into heart failure_ and one week prior to this_ terrible thigh and ankle swelling like I had NEVER seen before!  I found that after having my son_ 2008_ that I had been slowly developing heart failure.  My heart just could not keep up with my regular_ sedentary_ office all day lifestyle.  Long story short_ I had a 15% ejection fraction rate_ they believe I had a mini stroke_ as those symptoms quickly dissipated once I was on IV Lasix_ and losing all that fluid!  Needless to say_ I am over a year out on this thing_ my current EFR is now a wonderful 66% and I feel so much better!  I started this journey on about 9 different meds_ whereas I hadn't had to take a single prescription in my life!  Now I am on only 3 of those meds and while I still am not 100% activity level wise_ I am thankful for my LIFE and Coreg!

15, 1, High blood pressure,"After 5 by-passes in 2007_ I was placed on another beta blocker called Toprol which put 45 lbs on me in 10 months.  After a lower back operation in 2013_ three months later my blood pressure went up to 205/85.  Due this peak rise_ I was placed on another beta blocker called Coreg/Carvedilol.  I experienced such high nausea and dizziness that some days I could not even get out of bed for days.  Finally after 10 months_ my doctors took me off of this beta blocker after my health complaints and gaining another 10 lbs. The sad truth is I am still having the nausea and dizziness plus now aching in my joints especially in my feet.  On many days_ I do not think I am going to make it to the next.  I am now going to the gym five times a week due to the workout_ especially the treadmill_ making me feel better.

Sometimes they develop so slowly that you don't realize it's the meds causing the problem.,At this dose_ it helped BP moderately_ but lowered heart rate to 50. Did not control anxiety or palpitations. Could not increase dose because of heart rate and other side effects.

When the tachycardia increased in frequency over time_ my doctor initially prescribed Metroprolol_ and I later switched to Coreg because I began experiencing very blurred vision and frequent_ though mild_ confusion with the Metroprolol.  I much prefer Coreg and have even lost the 30 pounds I gained initally with the Metoprolol_ and it has not come back.  Hair loss was very evident when I first began taking Coreg_ though my hair was not considerably thinned; it has continued but to a much lesser degree and seems to be tapering off. Sometimes I feel listless/apathetic.  I notice a lessening of the fatigue/listlessness and dizziness side effects when I invest my time in cardio exercise_ but I have to be careful to warm-up and cool-down or I experience dizziness/faintness during or afterward.  Also_ I am a migraineur_ and Coreg is working very well as a preventative to the headaches_ though it was not prescribed for this treatment.  If I consume more than one serving of wine or beer_ I experience a sudden_ lingering increase in the intensity of all side effects. I have found if I drink very much (three or more alcoholic drinks)_ this effect can last for days_ so I have had to cut down when drinking socially.

This was a big help_ as I have severe trouble handling drugs and react to many of them.  I now take HCTZ as a diuretic instead of the recommended ones_ as it is one that doesn't upset my system. I went through a period of depression_ but I feel that was due to the diagnosis and not the drug.  I feel it has been a life saver for me.

107, 5, Viral Dilated Cardiomyopathy - CHF,Occasionally when I stand up quickly I get dizzy_ which only lasts for a few seconds.  I find that when I exercise heavily (steep climbing) I have to rest often -- the Coreg keeps my heart rate low_ thus making it difficult to push myself -- very frustrating!!,In 2006 I went into complete heart failure with an EF of 5% caused by a virus that had attacked my heart.  I ended up with congestive heart failure--my heart had extremely enlarged itself.  I am thrilled that the combination of Coreg (25 mg twice a day) and Altace (10 mg daily) and exercise has saved my life.  My heart has now normalized (EF of 55%)_ I exercise every day now_ watch my salt intake and have lost 15 pounds (now weighing 130).  Other than some occasional dizziness and frustration that I'm not able to exercise beyond my normal_ Coreg has been a wonder drug for me.,F,49,3  years,6/15/2009Email,Coreg

I've been on this dose for about a year and a half now and I'm tired of some of the side effects.  I work out 3 times a week (usually for 2 hours) and cannot lose the weight.  My last EF was 13 but I feel like it has improved.  I would like to cut my dose in half and see if that improves things for me.  I also have an ICD so I feel this may be overkill.

I was 49 years old when diagnosed.  Now I lead an active_ full life.  It is important to exercise regularly (I swim 1/2 mile twice a week_ walk at least 2 days a week) and maintain a healthy weight.  At first it was difficult to adjust to the suppression of the adrenaline uptake (I was an adrenalin junkie!)_ but now enjoy the tranquilizing effect the drug creates_ especially in crisis situations.  I've recently lost 20 pounds and have noticed increase in wheezing from asthma_ so may ask Dr. about reducing the dose a bit.  My BP was 80/50 last time when I saw the Dr. in March_ so it may be time to adjust the dose.  We are lucky to have this drug.

Significant hairloss and some weight gain which are both very frustrating and hard to manage.,I believe that this drug has helped improve my heart failure significantly (which was caused by a viral and bacterial infection of the heart muscle).  When I was diagnosed with heart failure (back in 2004)_ my EF was about 30% and now my EF is 60%.  I'd also developed severe mitral valve regurgitation back then but now my mitral valve has only trace to mild regurgitation.  I also have a prosthetic aortic valve (replaced when I was a teenager) and live at high altitude_ so even with these multiple stressors_ the Coreg has helped my heart muscle return to normal functioning.,F,44,4.7  years,3/26/2009,Coreg

EF is now  40% and I'm waiting to see if any positive remodeling has taken place. This stuff is indeed a wonder drug.  I'm walking 3.5 miles in an hour_ no stopping_ not particularly fatigued even.    Stay with it - it really is a great drug.

Maybe because the blood is circulating better_ My ef% was 20. I'll see my doctor again in June then I_ll know if my ef% went up. I feel a lot better but I believe it is because of the combo of drugs and the pacemaker. I am up to 6.25 of Coreg twice a day. I think that is as far as I will go.

It slows the heart rate and decreases the force of the contraction of the heart. Overall blood circulation is decreased.,Coreg is different from all other beta blockers. It has an alpha blocker which helps and can repair the lining of our arteries_ or the endotheliam. I think that it might be good for CAD patients. I have 6 stents and am just waiting on BP surgery. No more room for stents in my LAD.If I cannot lose this weight_ I will have to change medicine. There is a newer BB out named Nebivolol. It also has some unique actions with regards to BBs.

I have been scanned and examined in all possible ways and nothing interesting was found that could be causing my back pain.  Jump ahead many years to the present and again I have been scanned even more than before to try to find the cause of my pain.  Like before nothing interesting has been found.  I still feel coreg was the cause originally and is now continuing my pain.  7.5mg vicadins won't even dent the pain.  Any related comments would be appreciated.,For about 5 years I was on 200mg a day (100/100) I am now at 100 mg a day (50/50).
