2, 5, ulcerative colitis,Water retention_ fatigue_ quivering sometimes and chills--but Lialda gave me back my life and side effects are minor compared to what I was going through.,The cost of Lialda is so prohibitive that without insurance nobody but the rich can afford--meaning the poor will suffer without.

7, 5, Mild Crohn's Disease,None,This drug has been a miracle (I hate drugs and don't even take aspirin so this was a tough sell).  I had to change my diet (trigger foods mostly elimitated) as well for full relief but I took it for 1.5 years mainly symptom free and decided to go off.  1 month off and my symptoms came back reminding me of the horror I experienced before I was diagnosed.  Went back on Lialda and have not experienced a flare in over 2 yrs.  All bloodwork_ testing_ etc comes back normal.  Have never felt any side effects but elation and gratitude for giving me my life back.,F,28,3.5  years2.4 GM 1X D,3/3/2011,Lialda
