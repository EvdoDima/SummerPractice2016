8, 4, Hives (To help sleep and itch),Was originally to help w/ itch from hives. I have insomnia and WOW this drug has made such a difference. Doctor prescribed two scripts of it during my 1 month of hives. Just taking one a night until I run out and it helps immensely just getting me to sleep. I just need that extra help falling asleep. I'd say it helps with sleep quality as well. Very satisfied.,I had zero side effects other than the purpose the drug was created.,F,21,2  months25mg,6/9/2015,Atarax

11, 5, allergies/anxiety combined,sedative effect upon talking- however the best medication by far I have ever been described.

16, 1, bipolar anxiety_ sleep problems,diarrhea_ vomiting confused with gastro-enteritis_ no sleeping enhancive_ occulaire adjustments_ blurred vision_ state of confusion_ itchy dermatitis,I knew that I was Atarax non-responsive (as well as one of my son's).  We could drink an entire bottle and not experience any benefit to our problems.  We would only be stuck with the side effects.  I knew that if Atarax had no effect within the 24 hours following the initial dose_ to stop it right away.  I'm a doctor_ but that had no effect on my treatment. I pleaded with the psychiatrists to stop giving me Atarax (because it was the only meds that they put me on)_ but they refused_ so I was stuck on it_ until I played the game_ and told them that I was much better_ and they let me go.  My whole body has become a playground for Atarax.

23, 1, anxiety_ sleeplessness,I was actually prescribed Atarax syrup to take to help treat anxiety and sleeplessness that I was experiencing. This syrup smells awful_ tastes_ awful_ and all this medicine did was upset my stomach. If you have bad anxiety problems along with insomnia and a doctor tries to prescribe you this stuff_ just say no! I sure which I had.

It has been a very good drug for me but it makes me drowsy but only when I take it sometimes if I take regularly the I don't get drowsy. It helps a lot calms my skin down if itchy. I would recommend this to exzeema who suffers from a lot of itching.going abroad to hot countries also helps. I was the worse case bandages being hospitalised and the lot if you are bad then get dr to refer you to st Thomas hospital in Westminster it is one of the best hospitals with all the good doctors in dermatology. My daughter had exzeema aswell by taking her to a hot country Pakistan really cured her exzeema. I'm still taking atarax but only if needed and no more scratching at nights for me cause I'm partially cured in not as bad I used to be. I hope this helps. ,,F,33,10  years10mg,11/7/2013Email,Atarax

I know this medicine also treats itching so was wondering if it suppressed my itching even though I didn't need it for that and now that I'm done with it my body is going through withdrawal and itching a lot?

27, 1, hives,I was first given a shot of Visteril at hospital after a week of predisone (20 mg)and my hives were returning. I was pissed they gave it to me_ I felt like I could barely walk and I had to drive home. The initial effect wore off then I was wide awake all night (shot was at 7pm) I filled the script the next day_ took it one day_ still had the loopy feeling at first then decided to quit taking it. Two days later I quit the prednisone. I had horrible muscle pains_ bouts of depression and anxiety_ chest pains_ ringing in my ears_ nausea_ no appetite and lost 9lbs in a week. I thought it was all due to the prednisone_ then tried the visteril again after a week off the prednisone and didn't get the severe loopy feeling so I thought it was because of the prednisone. It helped with the itch due to hives coming back in full force but now after reading all the side effects from others on here. I can honestly say what I thought was prednisone withdrawal is now from the visteril. I even last week got a script for 25 mg of attarax. Took it last week up until yesterday. Then decided to quit taking them. I have severe muscle tension_ zaps in my back_ head and calfs_ only 4 hours of sleep and still wide awake. Alot of nervousness and worry. I would really like to know of these symptoms will work themselves out. I can say I would rather be up all night putting cold copresses on hives than deal with these side effects.

I lost my desire to exercise and experienced a significantly increased appetite.,Without medication I normally have terrible interrupted sleep_ so i tried Atarax.

But looking back_ I see that Atarax helped me a lot with the skin rash and pruritis_ although these symptomes appear only when I am awake and don't disturb my sleeping behavior as well as Atarax. Do I recommend it? of course yes_ but just for a short period and not in an exessive way. Try to find out why you can't sleep in stead of handing the problem to Atarax.

34, 1, I was taking Atarax for anxiety.,"I am going to try and explain in my own words what this new ""pill"" that I was going to be taking was supposed to help me with. Ok I guess when I committed my self to the hospital they started me on Atarax. I wasn't ever even told I was put on a nrw medication. When I found that out I was kind of upset. I thought to myself what did they put me on? But at that time it was working. So I said to my doctor well I guess_its working. Because when I first started the new pill it was working. Ok so then I was feeling good with Atarax. Then after I got out of being watched while I was taking it. Got out of the hospital I felt fine. Then it started that whatever that this med. Was the I just started taking was different. This new med was not the same. It made me laugh that new pill Atarax it made me sit there from the first I took it to my friends that were nice people I thought and that pill was not that right medication for me.  I would take it and then I would loose it. I would sit there a laugh about nothing. If this happen to anyone else please let me know",,F,26,4  weeks25mg 3x da,8/15/2012,Atarax
35, 5, Severe Itching,Drowsiness (which was the point)_ difficulty waking up in the morning,I love Atarax. I am taking it for a severe itch that no doctor has been able to figure out. I've been itching for 6 months now_ and wasn't able to sleep at night because the itch was so extreme_ I'd wake up in tears after less than an hour of sleep. With the help of atarax_ I'm able to get a full night's sleep. Waking up is difficult_ but I'd rather have that problem than the itchiness and lack of sleep. Unfortunately_ until they figure out why I'm itching and find a way to fix it for sure_ I'm going to be taking these on a nightly basis.,F,24,2  months25 1X D,8/12/2012Email,Atarax

37, 5, Allergies,None,Have suffered with horrible seasonal allergies. I made an appointment with an allergist for testing. I'm off the charts for seasonal allergies and indoor dust mites. She prescribed Nasonex along with irrigating my sinuses once a day in the morning. I also covered my mattress and pillows with protective covers to prevent dust mites. She also prescribed Atarax for bedtime. It works fantastic. I've never had a better night's sleep and I feel great in the morning. Wonderful drug!,M,64,14  days25 MG 1X D,8/5/2012Email,Atarax
38, 3, Hives,,"Hoping to dispel misinformation. 7 days ago I had a bad food allergic rxn. Bottom of my feet to the top of my head_ worst on torso.  Was prescribed Atarax + 40mg Prednisone/day.  First 24 hrs: no change. After reading on sites like this about people having hives disappear in 24 hrs on Atarax_ I started to worry. Even doubled up on the Atarax dose once.  48 hrs: went back to the doctor because my experience wasn't matching what I saw on the internet (this is why health care costs are rising).  The (2nd) doctor explained two important things: First_ ATARAX DOES NOT MAKE HIVES GO AWAY FASTER. It only helps with the itchiness_ and if I didn't need it for that_ I should stop taking it. I confirmed this with the pharmacist.  Second_ the only things that DO make hives disappear is a) Prednisone and b) time.  I stopped taking the Atarax at that point. End of the third day: started seeing real_ substantial fading_ especially on my extremities. Days 4-5: people wouldn't notice the marks unless I pointed them out. Day 6-7: pinkness barely noticeable everywhere except my chest (because of the sheer quantity that had been there). I liken the recovery time to that for acne. Hope this helps someone! Vowed I'd come back and follow up_ unlike people posting ""just started_ hope this works"" and never reporting back.

Once my body became used to the medicine (about a week) I didn't notice side effects much_ anymore.,I'm not sure it's helping the angioedema (which doesn't come and go; it's been pretty constant) - the side effects are MUCH easier for me to handle than claritin and it makes me less drowsy than benadryl.  I'm pretty sensitive to medications_ but my experience with atarax has been a good one so far.  It's also helped with underlying anxiety even though I'm on a fairly low dosage.  If my anxiety gets worse_ I would be willing to take a higher dose of atarax to treat it because this does not cause dependency like some other anxiety meds I've tried in the past.,F,33,3  months10mg 3X D,3/16/2012,Atarax

I did have a nightmare that nite_ maybe a coincidence.,After a first time bout of hives lasting on and off for about 7 weeks_ and finding only minimal relief from Benadryl_ oatmeal baths_ calamine etc._  I got a prescription for 10 mg of Atarax. I took it once and slept through the night without staying awake from intense itching. The next morning I felt a touch groggy but so grateful to not have any itching. I did not take another dose because there was no renewed itching and the size of the existing hives on my body was starting to shrink.  I did not get any new hives after this first dose.

46, 3, Itching,Nothing for over 40 years (other than drowsiness) then post menopause_ its drying effect was bad on my complexion.  So I stopped cold turkey OMG!,For a few months after stopping abruptly (an idiot move in retrospect) last April_ the insomina was horrid for a few months.  That resolved.  But what's followed has been a nightmare.  The ringing in my years is so noteworthy_ I have to attempt to talk over it.   I never had anxiety before (a mental brick) now I feel close to panic for no reason. I'll wake up with dread. My resting pulse rate has gone from around 65 to 120 (that's upon waking!).   My heart will pound_ my pulse will roar through my extremities_ throbbing unmercifully. I can go on_ but you get the idea.  It was so bad_ I had all my hormone levels checked.   I had a thyroidectomy in the early '60s so I watch that regularly and take dessicated natural hormone replacement.   Over 9 moths later_  blood levels are all normal_ and clearly I am not. I have no other underlying health issues.  How long will this last?! (the rhetorical cry of the damned)  I'm wondering whether to start back on a very low dose (like splitting the pills to 2 or 5 mg) but I'd rather not.    I'll watch this site for any signs of encouragement (OK_ that may be wishful thinking-- even documented discouragement will do.)  I can't find anything to replicate my experience online.

Is this a true sympton of this drug_ because emotionally it has helped me so much and also with my allergies..thank you,Would like very much to continue to take but..tha joint pain does seem to be related to this 10 Mg pill,F,69,25  days10 mg 1X D,5/24/2010Email,Atarax
60, 1, Chronic Hives,While taking it: Dry mouth_ severely chronically exhausted_ nightmares_ insomnia_ muscle cramps_ joint pain_ severe depression_ moodiness_ memory loss_ rapid heart beat. Even years after getting off of it: Always extremely tired even after getting plenty of sleep_ joint pain so bad as to make me limp at times_ memory loss_ moodiness_ muscle cramps so bad as to make it hard to sleep_ lack of concentration_ anxiety_ my son was born with half a heart.,After my son was born with Right Atrial Isomerism (half a heart) I started looking into this drug that I had been on for about nine year of my own child hood and had not taken it for about 5 years before I got pregnant (I had even done a very extensive purification program after getting off of it) and found another person who was also on it long term also had several kids born with birth defects_ one of her's even died from it.  My exhaustion/tiredness is so severe that even after 8-10 hours sleep I feel like all I can confront doing is going back to sleep. If any of you anticipate using this drug DONT!!!! And if you are on it now get off now before you get the long term effects!!!,F,33,9  years25 MG 4X D,5/6/2010Email,Atarax
61, 2, Anxiety & insomnia,Increase in appetite,I take other medication in addition to this_ one of them being  oxycodone 15 mg. Atarax does not make me tired_ sleepy_ dazed_ calm my anxiety or anything. I think my body has a high tolerance for sedating medication. I even took 100 mg at night time and I was still up for hours.,F,39,9  days50 mg 4X D,5/5/2010,Atarax
62, 5, Interstitial Cystitis,Sleepiness,I take this medicine at night so that the side effect is actually a little helpful.  I take this medicine as part of a three drug cocktail for Interstitial Cystitis (Amitriptyline_ Hydroxyzine and Pentosan Polysulfate).  Other than the sleepiness_ I have had no other side effect.,M,39,4  years25mg 1X D,5/1/2010Email,Atarax
63, 2, Sleep Initiation+Staying Asleep,hangover_grogginess_unclear thinking,Initially worked well to improve the quality of my sleep; after a while_ however_ I noticed that I'm always groggy_ tired_ and listless while taking this medicine-even after a full nights sleep. I normally sleep 8 hours-with this drug I sleep 10 hours and still don't feel energetic.,M,25,2  years50 mg 1X D,4/29/2010Email,Atarax
64, 5, Anxiety/Sweating & Asthma,Slightly drowsy for the first few days. I seem to not be able to sleep through the night very well although when I do sleep_ I sleep well and feel like I am fully refreshed upon wakeing.,I always had a problem with extreme sweating in situations that made me feel slightly anxious. I've also had to use a fast acting inhaler for weezing all the time. I workout often and workout hard. I am very healthy. My doc prescribed me Atarax 10mg and so far_ this has almost been a miracle drug for me. I now rarely weeze for no reason_ allergies are not bothering me_ My sweating has been reduced to basically nothing (unless physically induced)_ and I am waaay more comfortable in most situations as the Anxiety is almost disapeared. As I've said above_ I workout often and watch my weight_ along with other aspects of my body closley. The weight gain some are contributing to Atarax_ I have personally not experienced. Considering I smoke weed as well_ the hunger people claim this induces_ has been nothing I have noticed either. I have noticed I pee more and I am thirsty a little more when taking Atarax though. Maybe it's my higher protein diet_ or a combination_ but I have also noticed being slightly more gassy as well. It made me worry when I read people contributed weight gain to this medicine and possibly it's different for everyone but I am a firm believer that the weight gain is more so due to personal lack of motivation/will power or another drug.,M,24, 10 2X D,4/16/2010,Atarax
65, 1, Eczema,At first made me very sleepy and I slept good on it_ but last time I took it_ I stayed awake all night long and all night the next day_ today I'm hoping it will wear off.

66, 4, Hives/Angiodema,Weight Gain(~4 lbs every month)_ extremely increased appetite(was eating 3000+ calories when only 1500 is required)_ racing heart_ sleeo the first two days after starting the medication,Although I love atarax for what it does to my hives_ I cannot stand its side effects. Every year_ after my seasonal allergies end and I get off atarax_ I have to start exercising twice as much to take the extra fat off my body. I am a very skinny person by default and eat very healthy normally but when I'm on atarax_ its like my body has a mind of its own. I get extremely hungry every two hours and eat crazy amounts of food. I don't think gaining 12-15 pounds every year and losing it in the next few months can be healthy for my body. And I'm talking about 15% gain in weight...its nothing to sneeze at.Aside from all the crazy side effects_ this drug does work wonders on my hives unlike any other anti-histamines like benadryl or claritin. One curious thing after getting off atarax this year was I lost my appetite. It's been going for a few days now....let's see how long it lasts.,F,27,4  months20 mg 4X D,2/24/2010Email,Atarax

70, 2, Contact dermititis,This medication upon first use stays in your system for quite a while.  Effects are extreme sleepiness_ had a difficult time getting up the next morning_ arms and legs completely lifeless.  Can you say real bad nightmares when taking this stuff?  That may go away after continued usage.  I was in a fog the next day after taking this the night before.,For individuals with moderate pain not requiring opiate based pain killers I think atarax would be a great sleep aid.  No way you would combine this medicine with vicoden at night_ may not wake up the next day.,M,44,2  days,10/13/2009,Atarax

72, 5, severe skin allergy- unknown source,Drowsiness and that becomes more tolerable with exposure.Resting hand tremor in very high doses (125mg/day),Atarax changed my life. I had a disfiguring skin allergy and the most intense itching_ even in sleep. I'd been to many dermatologists and tried everything to no avail. Atarax relived the itching to the point I could completely recover. At my highest pt I was on 125mg daily. Now I take it for maintaince only when symptoms develop and I've not had a recurrance of anything that level in two years. An added benefit for an insomiac like myself is that it can be counted on as a sleeping pill as well. I don't know what I would have done if I'd never found it.,F,37,2  years,7/29/2009,Atarax

It also made me very nauseaus.  It's about 20 hrs after taking the one pill_ but I'm still very nauseaus and barely have the energy or motivation to not just sit here_ stare_ and drool.

79, 4, Hives,drowsiness,Had my first ever onset of hives 5 days and ago & bendrayl and clartin did not help it got worse to the point I was scratching myself raw. Doctor put me on Atarax yesterday (10-20 mg every 4-hours_ 30 mg total yesterday). I woke up this morning after a restful sleep and noticed a dramatic decrease in the size_ bumpiness and itchiness of the hives. Still a bit itchy but infinitely better.  I took a 10 mg pill at the start and near end of work today and felt slightly fuzzy in the head_ but not sleepy. Don't think I would do well at work if I took more_ but 20mg helped me not itch and scratch all day. Started on a 7 day taper today of prednisone to help with the hives_ which I HATE b/c pred gives me insomnia but the doctor said taking 20mg of Atarax before bed should conteract it_ so I'm optimistic my hives will be gone soon and my sleep won't be ruined by prednisone as it usually is.,F,34,2  days,10/21/2008,Atarax
80, 3, Interstitial cystitis_ insomnia,Fatigue_ 'dead' feeling emotionally_ low energy_ PAINS IN HIP JOINTS AND CALF MUSCLES,I started taking Atarax because I read that it helps bladder pain due to interstitial cystitis. I noticed that it helped insomnia and it works very well for this. Because of MCS (multiple chemical sensitivities)_ especially to wood smoke_ I have allergic brain reactions that trigger out-of-control crying jags and rage_ as well as profound depressions that can border on suicidal. I spent thousands of dollars on psychotherapy before discovering that all I had to do was take an antihistamine and I'd be fine. For this_ Atarax as well as Benadryl work wonderfully well. However_ the price I pay is the side effects I listed.  I thought I had arthritis until I figured out that the pains come and go according to whether I have taken Atarax or not. The more Atarax I've taken_ the worse the pain_ sometimes almost crippling. I have the same reactions to Benadryl and have entered these comments on the Benadryl page as well.,F,77,3  years,10/20/2008Email,Atarax

I was told to get off it and see if the electric shocks like prickly feeling goes away but today is hard on me because not taking any medicine for my anxiety.  I feel off it that i don't know if i can survive off it and going off 25 mgs is hard on me. Should i ask to be put back on it or what? What should i do?

83, 5, Extreme food reaction - HIVES,The only side effect I have experienced is the look of disbelief from a nurse who insists I can't be allergic to benedryl and that she/he has never heard of Atarax.,What a shame that more hospitals aren't aware of the intolerance that some of us have for benedryl. Benedryl does nothing for me. It increases the allergic reaction I am experiencing and puts my body into a state as if I was hooked-up to a full strength caffeine IV drip! Atarax_ however_ saves the day.. at least if I can convince the health professional that some people are allergic to benedryl and all histamine blockers are not the same.,M,50,5  years,9/3/2008,Atarax

86, 5, Anxiety_ PTSD,Drowsiness,I honestly cannot much difference between this drug and Valium_ Klonopin or Xanax. I have to take a lot of it (up to 100 mgs 4x a day) but it works well. I am not that bothered by the drowsiness and I welcome it over climbing the walls.I took benzodiazepines off and on for 25 years. After my 5th withdrawal experience_ I have vowed never to go on them again. God willing_ I will not. Atarax saved me. I have read that it is not meant for long-term (more than 4 months) use and it may lose effectiveness after that time_ but I have taken it off and on for 4 years and it still works. A word about the weight gain claims- I really think it is impossible for an antihistamine to make you fat. There is absolutely no literature to support this.,F,40,4  years,7/5/2008,Atarax

Now I occassionally experience grogginess only if I take a higher dose than usual for a few hours the next morning.,I couldn't get by without this medication.  It took over a year for doctors to figure out what would work for me.  Now I only need to take one 25mg dose before bed and that's it.  If I forget by late afternoon the next day I start getting the itching and hayfever symptoms.  I have to take it every day and use generic.  I'm glad to hear no one is experiencing any long term effects.,F,46,23  years,6/27/2008,Atarax

Also_ I experienced the dry mouth and heart flutters the first week_ but that went away.,I haven't had a panic attack in over a month now and that is a big deal since I used to have at least 3 or 4 a week.  It is working_ but I am not thrilled about the weight gain.  Maybe I will see how I do without it for a while and if the panic attacks return I will restart.

I have been using the generic pill (Hydroxine HCL) for 30 years. I have experimented with other pills_ but nothing worked as well as this one.My allergy comes like a clockwork and I know when to take the pill.

I've stopped taking it daily and now cut the 25mg pill in half and take when I start to itch_ which helps with the drowsiness so I can function_ but still very tired. Will ask my dr. if I can get a lower dosage on refill. Taking it twice a day did not help frequency or severity of outbreaks_ so I now take only at first sign of itching.

When it has worked it reduces itchiness to a more bearable level. It does not make the itchiness completely go away. Sometimes I have tried it with no success at all.Dry mouth and hoarseness are some of the side effects.

109, 4, allergies hives hayfever,Weight gain (5lbs/month)_ drowsiness_ headache_ hypersomnia_ muscle weakness_ dizziness_ dry mouth,Significant reduction in allergy symptoms_ shortness of breath_ hives_ nighttime itching etc_ but side-effects are extremely debilitating. I would not be able to work whilst on this drug_ then again_ I was unable to work due to severity of intial allergy symptoms and tend to be hypersensitive to all prescribed medication.,F,28,3  months,10/14/2006,Atarax

111, 5, Anxiety_ Insomnia_ Hives,Dry Mouth,Atarax works great for mild to moderate anxiety (doesn't help severe with me).  For insomnia it helps get to and stay asleep unless severe anxiety exists... and at the worst_ your very relaxed and at least able to rest.  For itching it works and hives it seems to work pretty well.The plus is that it's not addictive like Xanax_ Ativan_ etc. and that it's fairly safe from what I've read/my Dr. has told me.  I use it as needed.  It's nice to know there is something you can get for anxiety from your doctor without a whole lot of hassle.,M,28,2  years,9/5/2006,Atarax
112, 5, PANIC ATTACKS,DRY MOUTH,I HAVE TAKEN ATARAX MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD AND MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE.. IT IS A LIFE SAVER.. I AM NOW TAKING VISTIRIL_ BECAUSE THE DOCTOR I AM SEEING CAN GET ME THE VISTIRIL FREE FROM THE COMPANY. VISTIRIL IS THE SAME THING AS ATARAX. I DONT THINK I WILL EVER BE WITHOUT IT.,F,37,30  years,3/28/2006,Atarax

116, 3, anxiety and runny nose,side effects: background headache and sleepiness,This medicine made me feel more like a woman_ and that would be fine except I am a man and admitting that is fine as long as I don't say that outloud_ that would be embarrasing.,M,46,12  days,10/2/2005,Atarax

118, 5, Acute attack of hives,I had the best sleep I've experienced for years! I do feel a little sluggish the next morning_ but this tends to wear off as the day goes on.,As a chronic insomniac_ I've tried virtually everything in an effort to get a good night's sleep.  Conventional sleeping tablets either don't work_ give me rebound insomnia when I stop taking them_ or make me feel so awful the next day that it simply isn't worth it.  Purely by chance I discovered that Atarax works like a charm for me  -  8 or more hours of deep_ restful sleep.  I don't take it every night as I suspect that the effect would wear off.  Also_ it isn't recommended for people with early signs of glaucoma_ such as raised intra-ocular pressure_ which my opthalmologist is monitoring me for.  I just keep this wonderful pill as a sure-fire cure when I can't handle the insomnia any longer.,F,58,8  months,3/16/2005,Atarax

120, 5, Severe Night Sweating,The main side effect I experienced was sleepiness.  Produced a 'cloudy' feeling in the morning_ making it extemely difficult to wake up.  Easily slept very deeply for 10 - 14 hours a night.,It definately worked to ease my night sweats! I never wake up needing to change my clothes or the sheets anymore_ ever!  I'd also give it a rating of 5 as a sleeping pill.,F,25,1  days,2/15/2005Email,Atarax

122, 5, Chronic Hives,No side affects that I can remember_ maybe a sluggish metabolism.,I take 1 25mg. pill every 3 days or so.  If I don't take them I break out in hives all over my body. This pill has been a lifesaver for me and I couldn't live without it.,F,40,30  years,1/15/2005,Atarax
123, 1, To apparently stop bedwetting,I was a child then_ but from what my mother and other relatives told me was that within a week I had ballooned.  I got a huge stomach_ and also seem to get man breasts.  Which research I've been doing says that it goes back to the thyroid gland.  I suspect that Atarax messed up the function of my thyroid.,My mother discontinued use after the third dose or something like that_ too late the damage was done.  I've struggled with weight all my life_ while my sisters had no problems_ they might actually have been on the too skinny side_ all this cosidering my birth weight was lower than both of theirs.  I would appreciate any feedback if anyone else has had similiar experiences.,M,33,3  days,1/3/2005Email,Atarax
124, 1, anxiety,sleep/sleepyness,Didn't work for me_ but as a sleeping pill I'd give it a 5. The plus side to this medicine is that its non addictive.,M,23,7  days,11/9/2004Email,Atarax
125, 4, hives reaction to antibitotics,Nothing bad or serious.  Made me VERY tired and sleepy (which was to be expected).  I slept very deeply while taking it_ which was good_ because the hives kept me awake from the itching.  Sometimes I woke up with a minor headache. Gave me brain fog and felt a little,I would definitely take it again_ if the need arose.,F,47,10  days,9/27/2004,Atarax

130, 2, allergies,very drowsy (first few doses),seems to help with anxiety_ as far as allergy relieve I can't tell..seems to help a little.in general anti-histimines don't work at all for me so this was sort of a last ditch effort. First few times I took it it put me to sleep like I'd been hit by a train...but that wore off.,F,33,14  days,5/2/2004Email,Atarax
131, 2, Chronic hives,Initially Atarax helped for my hives_ but after taking 4 25mg each day_ then 8 a day_ then more and more_ my hives still came out all over my body....It's like my body wanted more and more Atarax.....so then I went on Prednisone....and then Doxepin,,F,27,60  days,8/23/2003Email,Atarax
132, 5, Severe case of hives,I fell asleep very quickly.. almost like a zombie state_ I mean instantly with a 25mg pill.  Caused me to sleep almost 14 hrs. I since learned if I quartered them it worked fine for a normal 8 hrs sleep.  But it is wonderful and gave me relief almost immediately when NOTHING else helped. Also excellent to use for inflammation of various types (mucuous membrane) to halt histamine production.,Apparently my physician thought the hives were caused by anxiety which it's also good for.  I'd had them a month_ no known trigger and nothing else gave me relief and the Atarax worked like a miracle!! thank goodness.,F,50,2  days,12/11/2002,Atarax
