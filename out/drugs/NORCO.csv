If the back muscle pain is a 10_ then this makes it a 7 or 8.  Thats not much of a reduction_ but during an episode_ its well appreciated.  The problem is that increasing the dosage or trying oxycodone results in severe side-effects negating the desired therapeutic pain relief.

40, 4, Back/neck injury,The comments here saved me!! PLEASE READ!!!IF YOU ARE HAVING BAD SIDE EFFECTS AND ARE TAKING THE WHITE OBLONG IP-110 GENERIC NORCO PILLS THEN STOP AND DEMAND THE YELLOW PILL!!,In Nov 2014 my pain management doctor changed my script from 7.5 Vicodin (no probs for years) to Norco 10/325 along with upping my Oxycontin to 20mg. Almost immediately I felt horrible with the Norco which was strange as it is just a stronger dose of hydrocodone than the vicodin I have been taking for so long. It kinda (didnt really) worked when i used my remaining Vicodin in the am  and norco later in the day but when I ran out of Vicodin.....IT WAS HORRIBLE! I even tried cutting the pills and making them 7.5 but THE HEADACHES_ NAUSEA_ DIZZYNESS_ LEG PAIN AND FEELING OF BEING A PIECE OF CRAP WOULD NOT GO AWAY. I basically spent Christmas in my dark room in bed ans was no company not even to play with my 4 yr old which was devastating. But......THERE IS HOPE!!!The Saturday after Xmas I went online_ punched in Norco+my side effects and found THIS BEAUTIFUL WEBSITE! So many ppl had the same issues and one of the most frequent recurring  posts was that ppl who had been prescribed THE WHITE OBLONG IP 110 PILLS HAD ALL THESE HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!!! Many ppl URGED DO NOT TAKE NORCO WHITE OBLONG IP 110 PILLS BUT ASK FOR THE YELLOW PILL INSTEAD! How can the color make a difference??

41, 4, Back surgery,Some constipation,This drug has been great for me. It takes the edge off my back pain without making me feel drowsy or high. I see a lot of negative comments on the site_ and I believe they may be true for those patients. But people vary in their responses to a drug.  What's great for you may be terrible for me. The most important thing is to make a reasonable choice to start with_ and if it doesn't work see if there's a substitute that might work better. In my case_ I started with Percocet and just hated it  made me drowsy and after a few days_ a little bit sad. I switched to Norco and things have been fine. But your mileage may vary! I wish you the best of luck and less pain ahead!,M,47,13  weeks5 mg 3X D,12/21/2014,Norco
42, 1, Back Surgery Pain,Constant shaking_ a nervous wreck.,Only taking the Kolonopin I still had the amphetamine effects of Norco. It didn't stop_ the shaking_ until I took a Norco. My doctor want's to switch me to Suboxone but I'm not sure if that is going to stop the shaking. I've tried taking only a half of a Norco but the shaking persists until I take the other half with two Kolonopin in me. I can't wait until this is over. I've been on narcotics forr back pain (and 6 spine surgeries) for the past 17 years and this is by far the worst drug I've ever been prescribed. I HATE IT! Please_ if there is any alternative for your pain medication other than Norco_ take it. This drug makes me feel like an addicted_ drug dependant looser. I can't cook_ clean my home_ eat_ nada because of the effects of the Norco (along with Kepra for any possible seizures from the drug) and my life has turned into a complete mess.,M,62,5  months 3X D,11/30/2014Email,Norco

48, 1, Rotator Cuff Surgery,I had rotator cuff surgery after a fall four months ago. My doctor prescribed Norco and three months of physical therapy. The PT was brutal at times so I changed therapists.  However_ last month the surgery failed. The only thing Norco does for me is make me feel good about the pain. Tylenol does nothing for me which my doctor explained is one of the ingredients. It relieved a little of the pain and a reduced my chronic low grade headaches_ but when I weaned off it I experienced a heavy withdrawal headache.  Then my daily the headaches came back. The two worst things about Norco is how it negatively affects my quality of life. First there are evil negative mental images that I see when I close my eyes. A narcotic that does that is like a bad LSD trip. I notice in the drug write-up that suicidal thoughts may occur_ but that was not what I felt_ only evil around me. The second evil thing I experience is one that negatively impacts my family life.  When I take Norco my disposition chang,,M,73,3  months10-325 3X D,10/10/2014,Norco

The second day_ I was awakened when The Virgin Mary_ attired in blue_ sat on the headboard of my bed. She was looking at me and talking a blue streak_ but I couldn't understand her.  I listened_ but I was really freaked out.  As abruptly as she appeared_ she disappeared. I was shaken_ but I went back to sleep. This drug made me VERY sleepy. Soon I was again awakened by what I thought was the dog scratching_ but it was my DAD in  angel form_ flapping his wings as he hovered over me_ saying not a word_ and really not looking AT ALL like himself. Somehow_ I knew it was my dad. He didn't stay long. I got up and walked a bit_ then I woke up my husband_ told him about my ""visitors_"" and he calmed me down enough to almost fall asleep again. But I looked at my sleeping husband_ and as I watched_ another angel came from his body_ flew over me and over to my bedside table and then flew back into his body. I again woke him up and told him to stop it. He asked me if he was snoring. The GOOD thing is that for those two days and part of the third_ I had NO pain anywhere in my body.  However_ I decided I didn't need hallucinations_ and they freaked me out_ so I stopped the medication. For the next three days I had a headache. I don't know if the cessation of the meds had anything to do with the headaches.

I noticed they did not work as well as the generic I got at WalGreens_ and then I began having terrible night sweats_ hot flashes_ bouts of nausea and dizziness that threatened to topple me over. I ran fevers though I was not ill. I thought maybe the symptoms were menopause ( I was 50 yo at the time.) I thought the pills I got those 3 months must be working but my pain had gotten worse after a car accident. Well_ the pharmacist told me that my regular prescription would be raised the next month to 6 times what I had been paying.

I am very upset with how sick this other brand is making me considering it's a lower amount of tylenol you'd think it would affect me less but I do have many allergies so it is possible that I am allergic to some filler of this Sun brand but from what I am reading other people are having headaches too. The pain relief is less than they were before April too.   For me these generics are not reliable - I can take them one day and be ok and have a pill from the same bottle the next day and be throwing up all day and have terrible headaches.  I asked my pharmacist to order the Qualitest ones again and he has so I am truly hoping that next month will be good again - if not maybe my body is rejecting the meds altogether :( I will know in a week or so.",F,33,5  months10/325 4X D,8/3/2013Email,Norco

I've always had a high pain tolorence but 3 years ago had hip replacement with residual pain then  developed joint pain_ knee_ leg_ and foot pain followed by  tendon issues. Sometimes I would take a 3rd and 4th norco_ and seemed to quiet all my pains and I was able to get around. In the past year I developed muscle loss to the point I it was hard to get off the floor after playing with my young grand kids or out of a chair or even walk around.  Dr's were concerned all this might be due to Agent orange exposure from the army or norco. I stopped the norco for two weeks (with no withdrawel issues) but had no effect and pain was in far less control with Tylenol and IBP.  I also have diabetes ll and neuropathy from the agent orange and have been taking ACTOS for three years to control blood sugar. Forgot the ACTOS on a holiday trip recently and didn't take it for 4 days and low and behold joints are not hurting so bad I can get off the floor out of the chair and muscle tone is returning in just 5 days. Problems were not from norco but ACTOS! . Back on 2 norco tabs a day for back pain and no ACTOS_ beginning to feel much better.

The worst persistent side effect by far is the constipation: adding fiber causes stools too big to evacuate without discomfort_ but no fiber = no movement.  :'(,M,45,12  years,6/30/2009Email,Norco
120, 5, Migraines_ Fibromyalgia_ neck pain,Some constipation but able to control it.,This really has saved my life. For the first two weeks or so I would get tired when taking it_ but now it kills the pain but I don't feel tired and am able to move around and function like a human being.  I know the addiction potential is high_ but I also know what it is like living in pure hell everyday from the pain.,F,32,3  years,5/18/2009,Norco
121, 3, Get high,Euphoric feeling in the begining with a sense of relieved stress and anxiety_ a bit of cloudy head and seemed like you want to itch yourself all in all was a great med until you get addicted then its the worst ever- be careful,It is very easy to let this pill slip into the cracks of your life and plug the holes of your problems_ but once you get used to them being there they start rotting away and making even bigger holes and the only way to fix it is to simply by taking more and more until you feel like total crap and have become an addict without even realizing it and you won't even know it until you try to quit- then you know what the real pain was.,M,24,600  days,5/5/2009,Norco

124, 4, L5S1 Disk replacement_ fusion,nothing out of the ordinary,I was taking 2 of the 10/325 4X daily and it worked well until my pain went off the charts_ Dr. switched me to Morphine and I stopped Norco completely_ no withdrawls but maybe because of Morphine. Now pain is less and stopped Morphine and back on Norco 4X daily. Hopefully be able to get off all this poison as soon as possible. Long term pain is hard to control_ be honest with yourself and your Dr. and you will be just fine.,M,45,2  years,2/13/2009,Norco
125, 5, torn shoulder muscles,slight constipation_dizziness,just started taking the 10/325 apap version and I can already tell its going to do wonders for me. Was taking four percocet a day before this_ however with this for some reason or other im only going to have to take this two or three times a day. Its a godsend. Im coming up on my second surgery soon_ and im so glad to have this medication for comfort. I would recommend it to anyone in moderate to severe pain. Its not just something u take for the hell of it though_ so be careful. very addictive like all opiate pain killers. I even tryed oxycontin twice a day_ and I think that stuff is crap. Just make sure u have blood work done every three months or so to make sure its not affecting your liver badly. Im sure the dr. could just do a cbc to make sure your not having any ill problems from it_ and if u have to go off it_ do it slowly or you will have massive headaches_ diahrea_ pretty much pain all over_ and it will last for at least 10 days depending on how long u take it and at what dose,M,29,1  days,12/8/2008,Norco
126, 4, herniated discs and abdominal pain,Some constipation and dizziness if taken without food,Ive taken 4-12 of the 10/325 strength norcos for a while but i got switched to 4 of the 5/325.  it doesnt work as well as the 10/325_ but im worried about taking too strong of an opiate so im content with staying with the 5's. Ive tried kadian_ oxycontin_ percocet_ dulaudid_ fentanyl patches and norco is the only one i can use without feeling really out of it. It can be very addictive so be careful.  most people wont admit they are but going thru it myself i can honestly say thru experience that you dont think your addictive until you run out. when that happens its hard to make it a few hours without agonizing pain that seems to radiate from head to toe. All the pain seems real but after a few days the only pain that remains is the one that your taking the norco for.,M,34,7  years,11/30/2008,Norco
127, 1, fibromyalgia,EUPHORIA_ energy_ I felt great and loved everyone. Increased sex drive. NO PAIN.,THESE pills are the worst thing I could have taken_ because they are so highly addictive. Withdrawals are HELL. If you really don't need these pills_ then don't TAKE them. Please don't end up going through what I did. Withdrawals include: headache_ goosebumps_ chills_ hot flashes_ and no matter WHAT you do_ or WHAT you try...you WILL NOT SLEEP during withdrawals because of the restless leg....and it lasts a good 7-10 days_ my friends.

128, 4, Severe menstrual cramps,Dizziness_ nausea_ drowsiness_ euphoria,I would give this painkiller a rating between 3-5 depending on the dose taken.  During my first 30-120 minutes of cramps it does little to ease the pain but it begins helping soon after.  The key is to take it 30 minutes before you expect to be in pain which can be extremely difficult.,F,25,2  days,5/28/2008,Norco

I was in alot of pain since my cheeks had to be sliced open to get to my wisdom teeth. I took nothing after two days because I wouldn't be able to function. So if your in really bad pain and want to be knocked out this pill works. It took the pain away as well.,F,26,2  days,11/19/2007Email,Norco

But then_ I had all those things PRIOR to taking this drug so more of it all wasn't anything new.,Norco did actually work to take enough edge off the worst pain so that I could rest for a few hours_ and that's all I can ask for.  Nothing actually removes all pain so it works much better than Vicodin or that worthless waste of money_ Darvocet.  But WHY OH WHY doctors prescribe painkillers with side effects that create even more pain in the very places you just had surgery makes absolutely no sense.

It helps me be a little bit productive and happy;  Anything's better than lying around whimpering in pain_ but I realize I need physical therapy and other things to truly recover.

Takes only 1/2 to one tablet three to four times in 24 hours to control debilitating pain.

If you have addiction issues please be careful because in the end 1 is never enough and 2 is too many.,Please be very careful with this medication. I was up to 20 pills a day and didn't even realize I had a problem. It is very addicting for people like me who love opiates. It took me 6 months to taper down and finally been off 2 weeks. The depression_ anxiety_ stomach issues suck. I don't ever want to go through that again. Now I am in counceling and on other meds for depression and anxiety. I just got out of control with it!,M,26,3  years,4/5/2007,Norco

139, 5, Fibromyalgia,"At times it can make you feel ""high""_ but that is very rare.  It usually occurs if Ive taken it on an empty stomach.",I have been taking the generic form of Norco for about a year now in combination with various muscle relaxers and other rx's for Fibro.  In the beginning it was very effective_ but as with any drug_ ive started to grow a tolerance to it.  But by no means does this make it an less of an effective drug in combatting pain.  I take one every four hours_ but am finding that it is working less and less.  I would recommend Norco to a pain sufferer that is seeking something stronger than you average Vicodin which would usually contain 5-7.5 mgs of hydrocodone although HP has 10 but doesnt want all the Tylenol that comes with it.,F,26,1  years,3/3/2007,Norco

There are 4 kinds I know of_ Watson_ Danbury_ Mallingrodt & Qualitest. Only the yellow Danbury works for me. It has to do with the binding agents that the pills are made with. Some work better for some. You get twice the power of Vicodin with a lot lower dose of Acetominophen. These can be very addictive though_ so be careful.
