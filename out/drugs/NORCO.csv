28, 3, Back muscle spasm pain,Dry mouth_ constipation_ loopy fuzzy feeling_ tiredness_ nausea when starting for a few days.,This is prescribed by my GP along with diazapam during a back episode to help recovery allow exercises to commence.  If the back muscle pain is a 10_ then this makes it a 7 or 8.  Thats not much of a reduction_ but during an episode_ its well appreciated.  The problem is that increasing the dosage or trying oxycodone results in severe side-effects negating the desired therapeutic pain relief.

40, 4, Back/neck injury,The comments here saved me!! PLEASE READ!!!IF YOU ARE HAVING BAD SIDE EFFECTS AND ARE TAKING THE WHITE OBLONG IP-110 GENERIC NORCO PILLS THEN STOP AND DEMAND THE YELLOW PILL!!,In Nov 2014 my pain management doctor changed my script from 7.5 Vicodin (no probs for years) to Norco 10/325 along with upping my Oxycontin to 20mg. Almost immediately I felt horrible with the Norco which was strange as it is just a stronger dose of hydrocodone than the vicodin I have been taking for so long. It kinda (didnt really) worked when i used my remaining Vicodin in the am  and norco later in the day but when I ran out of Vicodin.....IT WAS HORRIBLE! I even tried cutting the pills and making them 7.5 but THE HEADACHES_ NAUSEA_ DIZZYNESS_ LEG PAIN AND FEELING OF BEING A PIECE OF CRAP WOULD NOT GO AWAY. I basically spent Christmas in my dark room in bed ans was no company not even to play with my 4 yr old which was devastating. But......THERE IS HOPE!!!The Saturday after Xmas I went online_ punched in Norco+my side effects and found THIS BEAUTIFUL WEBSITE! So many ppl had the same issues and one of the most frequent recurring  posts was that ppl who had been prescribed THE WHITE OBLONG IP 110 PILLS HAD ALL THESE HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!!! Many ppl URGED DO NOT TAKE NORCO WHITE OBLONG IP 110 PILLS BUT ASK FOR THE YELLOW PILL INSTEAD! How can the color make a difference??

41, 4, Back surgery,Some constipation,This drug has been great for me. It takes the edge off my back pain without making me feel drowsy or high. I see a lot of negative comments on the site_ and I believe they may be true for those patients. But people vary in their responses to a drug.  What's great for you may be terrible for me. The most important thing is to make a reasonable choice to start with_ and if it doesn't work see if there's a substitute that might work better. In my case_ I started with Percocet and just hated it ? made me drowsy and after a few days_ a little bit sad. I switched to Norco and things have been fine. But your mileage may vary! I wish you the best of luck and less pain ahead!,M,47,13  weeks5 mg 3X D,12/21/2014,Norco
42, 1, Back Surgery Pain,Constant shaking_ a nervous wreck.,Only taking the Kolonopin I still had the amphetamine effects of Norco. It didn't stop_ the shaking_ until I took a Norco. My doctor want's to switch me to Suboxone but I'm not sure if that is going to stop the shaking. I've tried taking only a half of a Norco but the shaking persists until I take the other half with two Kolonopin in me. I can't wait until this is over. I've been on narcotics forr back pain (and 6 spine surgeries) for the past 17 years and this is by far the worst drug I've ever been prescribed. I HATE IT! Please_ if there is any alternative for your pain medication other than Norco_ take it. This drug makes me feel like an addicted_ drug dependant looser. I can't cook_ clean my home_ eat_ nada because of the effects of the Norco (along with Kepra for any possible seizures from the drug) and my life has turned into a complete mess.,M,62,5  months 3X D,11/30/2014Email,Norco

It doesn't make me so tired I can't function and I take benadryl for the itch. I also have IBS-D so the constipation is a welcome change.

48, 1, Rotator Cuff Surgery,I had rotator cuff surgery after a fall four months ago. My doctor prescribed Norco and three months of physical therapy. The PT was brutal at times so I changed therapists.  However_ last month the surgery failed. The only thing Norco does for me is make me feel good about the pain. Tylenol does nothing for me which my doctor explained is one of the ingredients. It relieved a little of the pain and a reduced my chronic low grade headaches_ but when I weaned off it I experienced a heavy withdrawal headache.  Then my daily the headaches came back. The two worst things about Norco is how it negatively affects my quality of life. First there are evil negative mental images that I see when I close my eyes. A narcotic that does that is like a bad LSD trip. I notice in the drug write-up that suicidal thoughts may occur_ but that was not what I felt_ only evil around me. The second evil thing I experience is one that negatively impacts my family life.  When I take Norco my disposition chang,,M,73,3  months10-325 3X D,10/10/2014,Norco
