0, 3, YI,,just to let ypu know the first two nights your going to feel itching and burning those are the side effects.,F,23,2  days,8/10/2016Email,Monistat 7
1, 1, YI,Instant burn followed by an extreme itch that doesn't subside quickly. Swollen and painful.,I will never take this again and will not be recommending it.,F,23,1  days,8/5/2016Email,Monistat 7
2, 4, Yeast infection while pregnant,Slight burning and itching_ hours after RELIEF from YI. Only 1 day so far. Really not that bad. Just suck it up_ lie down_ and watch some TV while the pain subsides.,So happy I finally went get some Monistat. The yeast infection wasn't going away_ and I can already feel some relief after only a few HOURS. I cannot WAIT to not have to deal with this YI anymore.,F,26,1  days,6/23/2016,Monistat 7
3, 1, Yeast infection,As soon as I inserted the cream I felt itchy_ then burning it just kept getting worse! I had my hubby look at my vagina to see if it was red because it surely felt like it was and he told me that it was really red and irritated. It felt like some one was holding a lighter to it and very itchy at the same time_ I will never use it again! I will stick with my doctor medicine.,,F,38,7  days,6/22/2016,Monistat 7
4, 1, Yeast infection due to antibiotics,Extreme burning_ itching and extreme pain (swollen and redness) that did not stop.  Absolutely agonizing.  Wish I had read reviews about Monistat before inserting it.  The second day I inserted it_ it instantly started burning and caused unbearable pain again.   I started reading reviews and ended up in the shower trying to get it all out of me.  Once I managed to remove as much product as possible_ the pain stopped.,I will NEVER use this product again and only hope this information about so many women suffering gets to the right person to do something about it.  They obviously have changed their formula because many_ many years ago it did not affect me like this at all.  Do not use Monistat 7.,F,44,2  days 1X D,6/18/2016,Monistat 7
5, 3, YI,THE ITCH AFTER APPLYING SO EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE!! I couldn't stop moving and squeezing my legs together for about an entire hour _ it started to ease up after that,,F,15,7  days,6/15/2016,Monistat 7
6, 1, Yeast Infection,Listen_ I don't know about anyone else but the burning and irritation didn't calm for me. The first day was awful I admit_ but the second and third days were hardly any better. All three days came with intense burning and itching. Not only this_ but... I felt light-headed as well.,After reading up a little bit I am wondering if I am allergic to Monistat specifically_ because I have taken ACTUAL Miconazole before and I has never done this to me.,F,18,3  days100 MG,6/9/2016Email,Monistat 7
7, 3, YI,None so far,The applicator kept pulling the suppository out with it?,F,54,1  days,6/3/2016,Monistat 7
8, 1, Yeast Infection,Monistat should also include a hammer to hit yourself over the head for taking this.  The itching is SO F*CKING INTENSE YOU WILL WANT TO JUMP OFF A CLIFF!!!! DON'T TAKE THIS!!,"they should have a warning that states ""you will want to rip the insides of your body out because it itches so bad"" instead of ""may cause mild irritation""",F,38,1  days 1X D,6/2/2016,Monistat 7
9, 1, YI,Itch burn pain,Dont use it should be off the shelves,F,38,3  days,6/1/2016,Monistat 7
10, 2, Yeast infection,If anyone out there is wondering what it would feel like to have Satan ejaculate inside of you_ look no further than Monistat 7. Would not recommend if you are NOT trying to get pregnant with Lucifer's progeny. The white hot mega-itch fire semen of the Devil that they market as Monistat is sure give you the ride of your life.,It's night one. Will I come back for more? Doubtful.,F,21,1  days,5/24/2016,Monistat 7

12, 4, Yeast infection,So it's night 1 and so far I have mild itching. After reading previous comments I feel better about the itching  I thought  I was having a allergic reaction. But it seems normal.,Let's see how the next 6 days go.,F,18,1  days,5/8/2016Email,Monistat 7
13, 5, Yeast Infection,First night after 15 minutes I felt a little tingling but it went away a few minutes later.  That's all for side effects.,It's working very well_ I sleep just fine with this product in.  No burning or itching whatsoever.   I recommend the 3 or 7 day treatment with those two being gentle on you then the 1 day which is a huge dose and is very strong.,F,33,2  days,4/21/2016Email,Monistat 7
14, 5, Yeast infection,I've been on this for 2 days and I love it. There's hardly any burning or itching.,,F,27,2  days,4/11/2016,Monistat 7
15, 5, Yeast infection,So I'm used to getting yeast infections_ But I haven't gotten one in awhile. But now I do. Ugh! Anyway the first day of me trying Monistat 7_ It was super itchy and really uncomfortable. Wanted to rip my insides apart. The second day using it_ It wasn't so bad_ Itchy but not as bad. The third day which would be today_ I feel MUCH better. I have the Monistat inside me and barely feel itching so I'm assuming it's going away.,,F,20,3  days,4/4/2016Email,Monistat 7
16, 4, Yeast infection,First night I used this_ the burning and itching was so intense it was maddening. The burning subsided in 15 minutes_ but the itch remained for about 90 minutes. I've used this product before_ and I don't remember it burning and itching like this_ but perhaps I just forgot. The second night I used the product_ which is tonight_ a little bit of stinging and some itching_ but definitely nothing like last night. During the day today_ there was noticeable improvement in my symptoms compared to yesterday.,It's convenient_ you can buy it at a pharmacy and not wait to see your doctor. I'd use it again. You just have to put your big girl panties on and deal with the itch and burn before it gets better.,F,47,3  days,3/23/2016,Monistat 7
17, 3, Yeast infection,First day I had barely any burning and that was all but now I'm on my second day and I'm having slight itching and burning it uncomfortable I hope day three isn't like this I have 0 tolerance for pain at all,,F,20,2  days,3/13/2016Email,Monistat 7
18, 5, Yeast infection,I experienced intense burning pain worse than the infection with Monistat 3 a couple years ago. I am taking Monistat 7 now with nothing bad to report.  Just a happy vagina!,,F,39,  1X D,3/9/2016,Monistat 7
19, 2, Yeast infection,This is my first time having a yeast infection_ the doctor told me to get this product but the itch and burning it's so bad I can't take it 2nd night and I let it sit in there for about 15 min and after that I've been in the shower ever sense trying not to rip my insides apart ðŸ˜± Calling the doc on Monday,,F,30,2  days,3/6/2016,Monistat 7
20, 4, YI,1st day burning like crazy on fire...Second day not so bad just itching...Third day more itching but it is helping a whole lot.,,F,35,7  days,2/24/2016,Monistat 7
21, 3, Yeast Infection,Itching and burning like crazy.,I'm putting this review in here to hopefully calm down any other girl or woman using this product. Apparently this crazy burning is pretty common because I definitely thought I was having an allergic reaction but hopefully the burning means it's doing its job. I'm only on day two of the treatments and I'm not sure if I can make it if everyday will be this way but people have said it works so I'm gonna stick it out though the Monistat burns worse than the YI itself.,F,19,2  days,1/30/2016,Monistat 7
22, 4, Yeast infection,After applying the medicine I had very uncomfortable itching and burning. I didn't know if I could apply for 7 nights like that. I was feeling much better though from the infection by day 2.,I'm posting in case this helps someone else...I started putting Vaseline before application on outer skin near application and it made 100% difference. I was able to tolerate the application with minimal discomfort. What a relief because I did need the treatment. Try if it's driving you crazy.,F,34,7  days5mg 1X D,1/25/2016,Monistat 7

24, 3, Yeast infection,First night i did this_  I was itching internally so bad.  During the day is fine_  but each night when it's time to put it in again.  Five minutes after the itch is back for about an hour.  Not as bad as the first night  but still itchy.  I had no burning_  just the itch.,,,41,5  days100,1/15/2016Email,Monistat 7
25, 5, Diagnosed with first YI,The first day was definitely the worst_ about five minutes after insertion it itched like a mofo. I did have a little bleeding one the third day from insertion. I m on day five now and I have no itching. I did use a very small amount of KY Jelly on the tube to help with inserting. From the first day I could tell my YI was getting better_ the key is just to make it through the first night.,,F,35,5  daysMonistat 7,12/28/2015,Monistat 7
26, 1, Mild Yeast Infection,BURNING SENSATION! and ITCHY!,This is HORRIBLE! My YI was nothing compared to the burning sensation your going to experience once you insert this product. I rather let the YI naturally leave my body than use this crap again!,F,20,3  days,12/23/2015,Monistat 7
27, 1, Mild yeast infection,The only relief I have is from seeing the other comments. I am NOT going to continue this. It is absolutely rediculous. My YI wasn't even that bad but I just wanted to get rid of it but the darn YI wasn't even this bad. This is completely maddening. I wiped gently with a cool towel to get relief and that has helped but I can't do this anymore and I REFUSE to use it another day. Calling the doc Mon morning ASAP!,I'm going crazy!!! I'm sleepy and can't sleep I'm feel like I'm going crazy,F,32,1  days,12/13/2015,Monistat 7

29, 3, YI from abx.,The burning and itching after insertion is so miserable. I thought maybe there was something else wrong with me and maybe it's not a yeast infection so I decided to google comments if what I'm feeling is normal. And thankfully I'm not the only one who's experiencing this! It is VERY uncomfortable and I hope it doesn't last long..,,F,25,7  days,12/1/2015,Monistat 7

32, 2, Itching_ burning_ felt YI coming on,When inserting the cream_ within minutes after I experienced internal itching and burning to the point it's unbearable to sit still. Now I understand this warning is noted on the packaging box etc but why in the hell would anyone want to add additional discomfort such as itching and burning when you are already experiencing similar discomforts from the YI? I still don't know how I have lasted as I am on day 6 of the 7 day treatment.,WARNING to MOTHERS_ I would highly recommend anyone seeking relief via any other product as a first choice. I am a mother of a toddler and to be honest with the pain and discomfort caused by using the Monistat 7_ I did not want to be around my toddler In fear that I would snap at her due to my discomfort.,F,35,6  daysMobistat 7,10/26/2015,Monistat 7
33, 3, Itching_ bad Odor,I bleed every time I do the treatments. This time was the worst. I bled for 7 days after treatment. My period only last for 3 days.,,F,35,7  days,10/21/2015Email,Monistat 7
34, 3, yeast infection,Burning,this was my second time having a YI. first time I was very young and ended up drinking tons of apple cider vinegar courtsey of my mom. I decided not to do that and get something better. Monistat works but dear god does it burn the first time it goes in. the next morning i feel a lot better_ but I wish the burning and itching would stop. just for five freaking seconds.,F,27,3  days 1X D,10/19/2015,Monistat 7
35, 3, YI from amoxicillin,"Monistat7 needs to rephrase ""mild vaginal burning"" to ""god-awful vaginal burning."" I know it's the cream working_ but now I can't sleep because of this pain. It works_ but I might try something else to avoid the burning and leakage next time",,F,,3  days,10/11/2015,Monistat 7
36, 5, just finished anti. 4 bv now yeast,At first I bought the 3-day store brand but it burned but not bad so I decided to go back and buy Monistat 7 and did them  together  that's how irritated I was I would insert the store brand in the am and Monistat 7 at night almost instantly relieved all burn never really was itchy. After day two there was no more chunky discharge just the cream coming out however I think I only had a mild case. Well definitely use this forever,They should make Monistat 7 in the little bullet insert instead off the cream so it is not so messy,F,26,3  days,10/9/2015,Monistat 7
37, 2, 2nd day of itching,Took this bc i was like i want to get this gone right away. Burning! I had to lay down and started spasming bc it itched and hurt soo much. The burning was too much so i had to take a cooling pac and place it on my vulvia... Next time using monstat 3 those came ovuls.. Soooo much cleaner and didn't burn my insides,Now 2 hours in i cant move my legs bc its in a somewhat comfertable spot. I should have done half the dose,F,21,1  days,10/2/2015,Monistat 7
38, 2, 7 weeks pregnant with YI,"""Mild"" itching is an understatement.  Minutes after I inserted it I began to feel the worst itching I've ever felt. It lasted 30 minutes each day and I'm on Day 4. It got worse anytime I urinated. I kept spasming due to the pain and couldn't focus on anything else. Next time I'm going straight to the doctor.",,F,23,4  days100 MG,9/25/2015,Monistat 7
39, 4, Yeast infection during keflex/UTI,The yeast infection was better than the burn & I was not going to continue Monistat. The next day I felt some relief_ so I waited another day and the burning of the yeast infection started to come back so I decided to try Monistat again but only 1/2 dose to see if that extreme burning returned_ it didn't so after a 1/2 hr I applied the other 1/2 dose. Much better on night 2 of Monistat 7. I'm on night 5 now and still good. I read that maybe the extreme burning was because the yeast infection was so bad.,,F,44,1  days7 day,9/14/2015,Monistat 7

41, 4, Yeast infection,The burning actually made me feel better then I feel like scratching my whole area offðŸ˜– it's unbearably itchy but it's way more comfortable than vinegar. But I want to stop itching so bad. I have company and I'm in my room laying down bc it's so itchy. I hope tomorrow is best! I get yeast infections like 5 times a year and usually I go to the doctor but I couldn't so I bought the monistat cream 7 day and it's making me itch more! I hope this goes away soon! How long does the itching last?,I wish they had a cream that relieves itching fast!,F,22,7  days100 mg,8/14/2015Email,Monistat 7
42, 4, Yeast infection -_-,First night using it and it starts burning and itching! So i thought I was having a allergic reaction because it got a worse until i googled reviews.

43, 2, Yeast infection from Sulfa Pill,Itching from the depths of hell,I am taking fluconazol as well_ but I started using this 7 day treatment to try to relieve my symptoms faster. From the first day_ I used the insert cream and the external cream at the same time_ and from the first day_ every time I put it in/on I start itching a 12/10. seriously it's the f***ing worst itch of my life and I've had poison ivy covering both full legs. I can't even explain in words how badly it itches my boyfriend said I look like I'm having an exorcism. during the day I have no itching and it only starts once I put on the creams. Moral of the story_ it's day 5 today and I'm quitting . BUT- I can't say it hasn't helped me a LOT! for real from day 1 I was 10x better than the night before_ even if I had an itch exorcism. also_ now on day 5_ I put in the internal cream then put on the external cream_ once the itching started I wiped off the external cream after 5 minutes_ and my itching went from a 10 to a 3 almost immediately! my suggestion_ maybe just use the internal cream and forget about the external!,F,18,5  days,7/4/2015,Monistat 7
44, 5, yeast infection brought on by rx,None,I didn't experience anything like most of these reviews.  I normally buy the store brand when needed (forgot to ask the dr for diflucan) but it was sold out.  I'm on day 6 & have had no side effects.  There is normally some itch_ pain_ & discomfort with a yeast infection_  but this allows me to get through the worst of it with instant relief.  I have a 10 day course of Antibiotics so this started on day 2 & is the only reason I'm functional.  I'm not sure why I didn't have any crazy side effects but I'm not mad about it! :-),F,32,7  days,6/12/2015,Monistat 7

46, 5, YI,Burning and itching!,I had never experience anything like this before. The first day_ i was itching sooooo bad i was about to get it out of me but i knew it was the medication working. Second and third days were not so bad. First day is the worst! Ii thought i was going crazy. I couldnt control myself,F,28,3  days,5/26/2015,Monistat 7
47, 1, YI,God awful itching.  I will take the YI.,Monistat 7 is the worst OTC medication I have ever used in my life.  I am on an antibiotic right now and I felt a YI coming on so I figured I would be proactive and take a dose of Monistat 7 day.  It had the cream to put into the tubes.  In less then 3 minutes I had itching like I had never had itching before.  I tried to get it all out of me.  Ever since I have been preggo I tend to get YI more easily  So i tend to use the 3 day modules.  They work like a charm.  I will never get 7 day cream ever again in my life.Why is this even happening to so many women?,F,33,1  days100 mg 1X D,5/16/2015Email,Monistat 7

I was hoping for a miracle drug that would cure it instantly_ but I guess I'm just going to have to suffer the last two days. The only real complaint is that it the stuff you actually put inside you gets melty pretty easily. Then it's impossible to actually put it in.,F,18,1  days,2/22/2015,Monistat 7

57, 2, yeast infection,Im sooo surprised that I had any bad reaction to Monistat. When it was available by RXonly it ALWAYS worked as the PERFECT anecdote. I wonder if the OTC has a different formula?? Has to be true. Wayyy to many women are having bad reactions. So the Pharmaceutical industry gets both your cash and a doctor visit for Rx...since the OTC wont work for at least 30-40% of women.,,F,32,7  days30 mg,2/12/2015,Monistat 7
58, 3, yeast infection,I used monistat 7 years ago when I had my first infection. My mom bought me the 1 day treatment. It was one of the worst pains I have ever experienced (and im a kidney stone patient!) and I had to wash it out and use the pill. I am prone to yeast infections and for years after my first monistat experience_ I refused treatment and just let my body figure it out. This time round_ I wanted releif. I hate doctors so I didnt go. having had about one or two yeast infections a year for 7 years_ I know when I have one and dont need a doctor to tell me that. I bought monistat 7 since I knew I needed a low dose. I felt very mild burning the first use. Day 2 & 3 I did not feel a thing. Tonight is day 4 and I felt burning and itching like crazy. Pain wise_ about a 6/10. Not the worst but definitely uncomfortable. I am still planning on finishing it out the full 7 days. It has helped the majority of the time. I just find it odd in the middle of treatment that the worst burning and itching occurred.,,F,21,7  daysM 7 day,2/9/2015,Monistat 7

61, 2, Yeast Infection,Burning sensation from the depths of hell!  Severe cramping and itching.,I went to the doctor and was prescribed Monistat 7.  The box said to take at night_ so I followed all of the directions and inserted the cream around 9 pm.  Not 2 minutes after inserting the burning pain and cramping started.  The itching was intense as well.  I felt like my insides were on fire and I am not exaggerating.  I thought several times about having my husband take me to the er because I felt that I was strongly allergic to something.  So_ instead I thought I would call the company and see if this is normal.  The Monistat phone number seriously has 666 in it (I am not joking).  I felt that my who ha was burning in Monistat hell.  There had to be something better to take for a yeast infection or if this is supposed to feel like this then women need to be given a pain medication to help with the side effects.  I remained in bed the whole next day.  I am not saying to not use it_ but be prepared for the possible painful side effects.  I_ too_ have used Monistat in the past and never had a problem (it was 12 years ago)_ so I don't know if they have changed the formula or what.  I did feel relieved by reading these comments.  So_ what I have learned_ Monistat is must be manufactured in hell because of the horrible burning_ they suggest you take it at night_ their company closes at 5_ so you can't talk to anyone after you insert the stuff and start freaking out_ and their phone number concludes that it is manufactured in hell with the 666 phone number.  Good luck ladies!,F,39,7  days,1/4/2015,Monistat 7

66, 5, Yeast infection,Starting from first application_ yes it will itch and burn but thats only because its working to help the infection. The yeast infection itself itch and cause pain.So I suggest anyone who uses Monistat 7 give it time to work .It will cure most yeast infection if you use it for 7 days.Really did wonders for me.I always use this product and I would recommend any woman to give it a try and see how good it works.,Any medication will cause some kind of symptoms at first but over time it is worth taking especially Monistat 7.,F,37,7  days,11/6/2014Email,Monistat 7

I bought M7 and used it at night_ like it says_ I layer down for about 10 minutes...OHH MY GOD!!! the burning was like no other_ and then the burning lessened and the itch factor came. It's my first night using it_ and the side effects are bad_ but after reading these reviews_  I might stick it out and hope it gets better by day 2-7...,,F,22,1  days,9/30/2014,Monistat 7

I was so embarrassed to talk about my yeast infection to anybody!! but now that im pregnant i knew it was time for that talk with my OBGYN and ofcourse i wanted to prepare my body for the babys welcoming. this is my fifth day using the medicine that was prescribed to me by my doc and i felt the infection clear up by the second day!!! of course theres a bit itching but my doc said that just means the medicine is working but honestly its not an itch i cnt handle its so light! ALSO_ wear a mini pad to absorb any leakage cus you will have some!! and try to lay down as soon as possible it really helps !!  the ONLY thing is. after the 3rd day its getting harder to slide in the tube. i would use lube but afraid it will interfere with the meds! anyways im so excited to stop using the meds and be NORMAL AGAIN!!!

On my second dose I went and washed it out with cold water. Now I'm currently using monistat 7. First night for about a hour it was extreme burning and itching. And I almost gave in an washed it out but I was like my health is important be strong! Now I'm on my second night. And it's not as extreme as the first night. It's very light.

74, 3, Was taking antibiotics,I truly believe that everyone's body is different therefore everyone will react to this product in different ways. I'm glad I didn't research reviews before I took monistat 7 because I would never took it. The first day I inserted it it felt funny and then the mild burning combined with the itching began but it quickly subsided within an hour and I felt no itch at all and a barely noticeable burning feeling. Slept like a baby and the next day there was no burning or itching at all. Took it again for tee next dosage and it was the same as a day one. The burning was tolerable and this is coming from someone who has a VERY low tolerance for pain. Seriously_ I'll cry if someone kicks me but this product was very tolerable but annoying at the same time. I will continue to use this product for the full seven days.,,F,21,2  days,9/25/2014Email,Monistat 7

77, 1, yeast infection,Please get a prescription from your obgyn or only use the CVS labeled one. CVS one is mild and from my experience_ the CVS one doesn't cause reactions. DO NOT BUY Monistat and also please check label ingredients on any product you use for your skin or body. I've had twice the mistake of pur chasing Monistat because CVS isn't close by.

My yeast infection was much worse then so I thought why not try something a little more gentle since the itching and burning wasn't as intense. As soon as I inserted the capsule and applied the cream I felt a mild burning. It's more like a really warm feeling but it doesn't bother me. I just saw some of the reviews and I didn't have the intense burning_ it's pretty tolerable actually. I'd say the discomfort is a 2 out of 10. I just hope this works!!

The itching and burning sent me to Urgent Care. I ended up using prescription medication. This time I'm 30 weeks pregnant and didn't want to risk taking anything without a doctor's advice. They told me that Monistat 7 was the only thing that I could use. 15 minutes after inserting it it was uncomfortable and itched for about 5 minutes_ but it wasn't anything I can't handle. I'm more concerned about how it will effect my baby than the burning. So far so good.

I bought the Monistat 7 combination pack and had zero bad side effects! I'm done with the pack today and I'm back to normal! This worked wonders for me. Don't be afraid to at least try it especially if your symptoms are as bad as mine were (itching_ burning). Also_ do not try to rush it by getting the monistat one day or three day. Those may be too harsh! Everything takes time and 7 is best! Good luck to all you women out there & I hope you feel better soon!,,F,28,7  days,11/14/2013,Monistat 7

136, 3, Yeast infection,Extreme burning on the inside of my vagina immediately after using the applicator and inserted the oval pill. I also felt extreme heat in my inside.,I chose to use the Monistat1 Day treatment Day or Night pack which came with the applicator_ one white oval pill and 1 tube of cream to relieve the itching. The topical cream only caused a slight burning for a few minutes but nothing too bad. However_ about 10 minutes after i used the applicator_ I felt a burning that i had NEVER experienced before. It was sooo severe that i was trying to ice the area over my pj bottoms. I came upon this website just when i was starting to freak out and thank god for all the other comments. I feel very comforted to know that its NOT ME!! THe burning was horrendous for about 3 hrs and is now starting to subside. I still feel burning and heat but a lot less than a few hrs ago. From my experience_ i can say that its probably better to lay down and sit up. You will definitely feel less burning lying down.

However_ the first 2 nights I experienced some of the most intense itching ever. My infection was brought on by antibiotics. I just did my last treatment last night and I feel great. If you can stand the first few nights it does get easier to handle with each treatment. If you don't think you can tolerate the itching I have heard there is a pill your doctor can prescribe that have little to no side effects. So I rated this a 4 because it has seemed to work_ but the itching is pure toucher.

A VERY slight stinging feeling after applying the external cream_ but it goes away quickly.,I logged onto this site AFTER inserting the 1-Day/Night Ovule and got freaked out by all the comments_ then took 3 Melatonin (for sleep) and 2 Acetominophen (for pain). I ended up not falling asleep but never experienced the crazy burning logged here by so many others. Thank goodness! I woke up in the morning and felt fine. No problems at all. Applied the cream again the next day around lunchtime and it did sting/burn just a TINY bit but only for about 2-3 minutes.I had been experiencing itching for about 1.5 weeks before I called my Dr. and she recommended I get this rather than coming in for a check up. It may not have been a yeast infection_ but I guess I'll find out in 6 more days if the itching is gone.

I'm a little nervous about the internal treatment because all of the negative reviews_ but I hope it will work! Even though I haven't tried Monistat 1 or 3_ with my knowledge about medication_ I would definitely suggest 7.

173, 5, Yeast Infection during pregnancy,Burning/itching on par with yeast flare up the first two doses,I developed my first yeast infection at the end of my second trimester.  My mid-wife recommended Monistat 3.  I did not trust this recommendation for the following reasons: A) History of bad medical advice from doctors and nurses_ B) Many sites warning against use of Monistat online (especially the higher 1 and 3 day doses)_ C) Preference for maintaining health through diet and certain home remedies before relying on the pharmaceutical industry.  I ingested crushed raw garlic and yogurt_ and applied garlic cloves and yogurt directly for a few weeks_ but as soon as I went a few hours without treatment I would get a bad yeast flare up.  After 3 or 4 weeks of increasing misery I decided to try the Monisat 7.  The first treatment burned and itched slightly more than the yeast itself_ the second treatment less so_ the third treatment a warm sensation_ and the fourth/fifth/sixth had no noticeable feeling.  The discomfort from the infection was gone after the fourth dose_ and all discharge/symptoms are gone after the sixth dose.  I still need to use the seventh treatment tonight_ but I am pleased with the results.  Baby is still kicking and active_ and my parts finally feel clean and normal again.  I still eat plain yogurt daily and plan to ingest garlic 1-2 times per week as a preventative measure_ but the Monistat did the trick for a full blown infection.,F,26,7  days2% 1X D,11/17/2010Email,Monistat 7
174, 3, yeast infection,Slight burning sensation_ great deal of itchying and irritation,I used monistat 7 a couple times before.

I read the directions and side effects etc_ before i inserted the pre-filled app. The side effects stated that i might experience burning_ itchying_ and irritation. But i never experienced that before while useing this product. So i went ahead and insterted the app. And not even 10 min. after i felt slight burning but alot of itchying. I was so tired and wanted to sleep but couldnt. So i took some night quil_ which knocked me out. And when i woke up the next morning the pain was gone. So i thought.I went to use the bathroom and when i was done. It all started back up again. So i took some tylenol and went back to sleep for maybe 2-3 hours. When i woke up the pain was gone again. I was to nervous to move b/c i didnt want the pain to come back. But it didnt. I felt fine. Well...randomly i would feel about 5-10 sec. of itchyness and irritation. But that was it. I know the side effects can be unbearable_ but once its done...you'll think it was worth it. However after reading everyones comments_im still a little iffy with this product. Only because lately everyones experiencing the side effects after how many times they've used this. It really makes you wonder if they changes something in the product.

The pain was absolutely debilitating and lasted about 4-6 hours until it slowly wore off.,"I used Monistat 1 Day treatment yesterday for what was a very mild yeast infection.  I wish I had researched the product before buying it_ as it would appear most people feel the 7 Day treatment is much milder and manageable.  This was my second yeast infection (the first was 12 years ago)_ so I was not well-informed and simply picked up the ""party pack"" version of the box: 1 day treatment ovule_ cooling wipes_ and a tube of external cream.  I inserted the ovule while at a public conference and almost left in tears; because I was at a work function out of town I had to white-knuckle through the intense BURNING.  About 2 hours into the treatment_ I went to the bathroom and I belive that after urinating_ something was triggered and that's when the sensitivity and BURNING began. I later joked to my sister that it felt as if an Altoid was thrust deep into my vaginal canal - it was THAT INTENSE.  But this is really not a laughing matter.Wheter you have had yeast infections a lot or never before_ this product is a scam as a super-mega-dose ""1 day"" treatment.  Please be warned!  I thought I had to go to the ER and frankly_ the it was very scary feeling that wretched internally in such a sensitive region of the female reproductive system.  I think having ""girl"" issues is one of the scariest as well as embarrassing problems to endure.

HELP,OK so this is my first yeast infection that I've actually come to realize and treat myself_ I bought a cvs brand that just had the pill_ wipes and cream. I read the directions and warnings fully to see what I had to do.. I followed as it said and all was fine. I had laid in my bed about to go to sleep and about 45 mins later I had to use the restroom_ I am totally new to this and I don't really know what to expect??:/ Is it supposed kind of come out? Its leaking if you may_ so I put a pad on and within 5 mins later this intense burning just came and stopped me from sleeping like so many of you had written about. Is this normal? Should I expect this to happen tomorrow night too? And some of you put the cream makes it worse.. can anyone recommend what makes this feel better? I regret taking it personally. I have class in the morning. Warning to all ladies: if you have prior engagements in the early morning don't take this at night. I can't sleep its so unbearable.

For me_ there was a definite increase after the first dose_ but it was totally bearable and I felt nothing in about 30 minutes.  For all other doses_ I felt NO side effects whatsoever.  Bottom line: Everyone is different.  But_ if you can stand 15 or 20 minutes of itching/slight burning after the first dose_ do not discontinue use since side effects seem to fade after each dose.

190, 3, yeast infection,Have had yeast infections before - had problems with severe itching and burning when applying Monistat - The effects were more intense than the yeast infection.  Did use the diflucan (one-time pill) on a few occassions.  Seemed to work really well_ until the last couple times I had to use one.  Had reaction - all over-body itching.  Very bothersome constant itching to where my skin was bleeding - had to be put on steriods to get rid of itching.  The only thing the doctor could associate it to was the Diflucan (happened two different times when I was given Diflucan).  Found the best treatment for myself was the long 7 day treatment - but I have to say the side effects are alot less invasive for me.,,F,46,3  days 1X D,6/28/2010,Monistat 7
191, 2, suspected yeast infection,intense itching_ some slight burning,(Monistat 3) At first I thought_ 'yeah_ me too' reading a lot of these comments. But I discovered something: it's not necessarily that we're all allergic or the product sucks - it might just be that the suspected yeast infection was not really a yeast infection at all. I'm pretty sure it even says on the box to not take the product unless you do for sure have a legitimate yeast infection. Hormones could just be out of whack_ or maybe it's a bacterial infection. That's not a shot in the dark_ I spoke with some people who know what they're talking about and that's what they told me. Regardless_ don't condemn the product without making sure it truly is a yeast infection you're trying to cure.,F,17,1  times30mg? 1X D,6/25/2010,Monistat 7

I jumped in the shower to rinse off and now im still burning but im trying to hang in there. The itching is worse than the original itch but now it includes burning. I cant wait till this is over.

I'm up right now dealing with it...how long could this possibly last???  The box did warn that there could be side effects...what am i suppose to do about it tho???  do i stick it out?  go to the er??  how long is this gonna last?

I knew that there would be some_ but this is too much. It's now been about 20 hours_ and I have no relief. I also feel a lot of pain in my clitoris I think because of the cream.

196, 5, yeast infection,slight litchiness,I have used Monistat 3 in the past and i had all the burning and itching that everone else seems to have and it was not fun. so the second time round i decided to try Monistat 7 since the doses would be lower and i am so thankful i did. Last night was my last treatment and i am happy to report that everything down there feels back to normal. I was afraid the first night of M-7 because the first night of M-3 was just horrible i cried my eyes out because the cream made everything 10x worse.   To my surprise i did't feel anything on my first night of treatment with M-7. The 2nd and 3rd nights i did experience a very slight itch but i was nothing compared to the burning of Monistat 3. The itch only lasts a few minutes and went away quickly. Although Monistat 7 is a week treatment it is very worthwhile and the low dosage is key. I just wanted to leave a review because the product worked very well for me and i don't think any woman should have to suffer the HORRIBLE side effects of high doses...please ladies if you take the time to care for it it will go away. As a preventative measure i am also going to drink more water_ consume less sugar_ and take probiotics. You all should try to figure out the underlying cause of the yeast infection is as well and not just treat it once because it will come back...take measures to live a more healthy life for your vagina!! good luck ladies (((BTW I used the WALGREENS version of monistat))),F,20,7  days200 1X D,4/19/2010Email,Monistat 7
197, 4, For a yeast infection,No side effects what so ever.Any  side effects I did have were due to the yeast infection as the burning_ itching sensation was there PRIOR to using this product.,I have used Monostat a few times many years back and haven`t had a yeast infection for over 10 years...until now. I bought the monostat with 3 ovules_ small tube and and the wipes. I was told many years back to make sure my partner if we have been sexually active to be sure HE used the cream as well. She said to use it as a lubricant and for him to use it a couple of days as well. A man is capable of passing the infection back to a woman and he will have no symptoms of a yeast infection. No where on the box does it give this advice but I knew it was possible from experience. The product makers should have this listed on the directions because not doing this will only cause the yeast infection to be passed back and forth between your partner. I love this product and it saves a trip to the doctor for something that can be taken care of at home.,F,45,3  days 1X D,4/16/2010,Monistat 7

199, 2, yeast infection,intense burning and itching,OMG I am so glad this site is here or I would really think something was seriously wrong. Im still afraid to continue this treatment but it feels about the same as having the yeast infection. I was so shocked when the itching and burning had started to become almost unbearable. It does say on the tube that this is a side effect but it does not even come close to preparing you for what it actually feels like. I am not sure I will continue this treatment. I have some other treatments on the way in the mail. One of them is called rephresh. I am hoping that it gets here soon. I am deployed to Iraq and should not have to deal with this but I had surgery the other day and I am guessing they really dosed me with antibiotics. The next day I started to feel the burning and itching of a yeast infection starting. I am starting to feel a little relief of the intense burning and itching. Lets hope I am able to sleep tonight. Again I am truly thankful for this site and all the posts. Someone_ more than one person please tell me it does get better as the treatment continues.,F,40,1  days100 1X D,3/7/2010Email,Monistat 7
200, 3, Yeast infection or so I thought...,Ok_ so I came to this board & was relieved to see that there were many ppl experiencing the burning_ painful feeling when using this product.  However_ my roommate told me she has NEVER experienced these side effects & urged me to call my doctor.  I did the next day & they nurse practitioner said that a) it should not be painful & b) the pink discharge is NOT normal.  So I was told to come in the next day.  I went in & the nurse practitioner tried to take a culture but since I had the monistat still in me_ she said the results could not be told from just a quick microscope screen.  She then asked about possibly having a urinary tract infection_ which I thought I might have a mild one due to my urine being cloudy.  She said she noticed that my uterus was indeed inflamed and she gave me antibiotics for a UTI_ since she said the symptoms I was experiencing were more indicative of a UTI than a yeast infection.  I did not realize a UTI can cause that itching feeling,I would rate N/A b/c I misdiagnosed myself and used the wrong product.,F,37,7  days 1X D,3/4/2010Email,Monistat 7

I recently tried it again_ hoping that it wouldn't hurt quite so bad as it did before_ and instead of burning_ I had an extremely irritating itchy feeling. From reading other comments_ I definitely will try using either Monistat 3 or 7 next time. Monistat 1 is just way too harsh despite how well it works; I would honestly have rather endured the yeast infection than to insert the ovule.,F,17,1  days 1X D,2/13/2010,Monistat 7

They use this type of vegetable oil in their creams.,READ THE LABEL BEFORE YOU USE!  ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES!  If you have allergies it might be more beneficial to use diaper creme.

Dumbest damn thing I've done. I woke up in the middle of the night_ clawing at myself in pain from this horrible crap! Not only is the burning fairly intense_ the itching is unbearable! I had no itching or burning at ALL prior to using the Monistat_ and now it's like I have a small fire burning in my vagina along with several rosebushes scratching the crap out of me! I would NOT recommend this_ I've used Monistat before and I did NOT have this reaction to it - but it's been 3 years between using it.

Last night was my last dosage and the itchiness from my yeast infection is completely gone. I started feeling relief the first night and by the 3rd night it kind of felt like a faint itch_ now its non existent.I hope I never get another yeast infection but if I do_ I would definitely use this product again.I guess the only bad thing I can say about this product is I notice the cream still comes out a few days after and it hurt a little bit when I inserted the applicator.

I am using Monistat 7 and I have no painful side affects at all. There was burning the first dose but it wasn't as intense as the Monistat 3. I started to feel some relief on the 2 day.

217, 4, slight yeast infection,As soon as I inserted the cream (did the 3 day one) it was intense burning_ itching_ warmth...I was about to go crazy so I came on this site and saw similar reactions.  However_ I have come to the conclusion that I'm sure it's tingly because it's working and I'll see tomorrow if it isn't as bad.  It REALLY sucks but I'm sure it's a wait it out thing. I also had BLEEDING which was scary to me but it could have been from when I inserted it because it's a hard plastic and I noticed some blood at the end so I could have accidentally hit the wall too hard or something.  Itched more when I stand but also more leaked out so I probably should have just been laying down.,I was scratching and itching constantly thru my underwear which is pretty gross but I literally couldn't help it. I ended up dabbing the relief cream alllll over (way more than they recommended) after 30 mins of itching and this actually helped A TON!!! Even though the burning/itching seemed to be more inside_ who knows.  Now I feel like I'll be able to sleep.  It just sucks because my yeast infection wasn't that bad and I think starting to go away on it's own but wanted to make sure it went away so it sucks that my symtoms had mostly vanished yet now they're back in full swing! the box DOES say itching_ burning may occur when you first apply so this shouldn't be anything shocking.,F,23,1  days,11/11/2009,Monistat 7

221, 5, Monistat 7 external cream,Warming sensation.,I am on a two week course of amoxicillin for a dental situation_ and at about the 7 day mark I realised a vaginal sensitivity had turned into an increasingly unbearable burning_ itching soreness that got to the point of keeping me awake at night.  So yesterday I got vagisil_ which barely took the edge off. Then last night I bought the Monistat 7 and cautiously applied only the external cream (kit comes with tube of 2% cream_ along with the higher strength inserts)_ just to be on the safe side!  Within less than an hour_ my condition transformed into a warm sensation - completely removing the former burning and itching_ but still sensitive.  I re-applied a couple times during the night as I got up to go to the bathroom_ which helped each time. I have another week to go on the anti-biotics - without Monistat I don't know if I could have continued. Tonight I'll def start with the actual inserts. A lot of people may have a sensitivity to Monistat but for me it is just what I needed.,F,43,1  days,9/4/2009Email,Monistat 7
222, 4, yeast infection,"I developed a vaginal yeast infection following a 10-day treatment on Flagyl for a uterine abscess_ menopause-related.  (Flagyl also gifted me with oral thrush_ which has been a bear to get rid of.)  I know from my past use that Monistat-7 always burns me like fire for the first 36 hours of treatment.  I was prepared for that.  Using the product before bedtime_ then taking Advil PM or Ambien_ got me through the worst of those side effects_ and occasionally an ice cube wrapped in a wet paper towel applied to external areas.  By Day 3_ I had no burning or itching_ and for the remaining days of treatment_ just a little ""warmth"" after applying the external cream.  I seem to be rid of the yeast problem now.","When I was a younger woman and more prone to yeast infections_ I tried a lot of those 1-day and 3-day treatments (including Monistat-3) and they were rarely sufficient treatment to get my system back to normal.  I go with the ""7"" because it has always knocked out the yeast for me.  With the shorter treatments_ I've endured relapses.  And that one-day_ solitary oral pill--fluconazole?  Useless in my experience! I find that a couple days of significant discomfort and mess on the Monistat 7 cream is worth the cure.  I've also found that taking an oral capsule daily of 50 billion cultures (lactobacillus and bifidobacteria strains) assists the body in getting its yeast/bacteria balance back_ particularly if that was thrown out of whack by antibiotics.

225, 4, Yeast infection,Severe itching and burning and slight pain.,I purchased the $18 Monistat 1 day treatment that comes with 1 ovule_ 5 cooling wipes and a tube of cream.  The first night that I took it I did not experience any side effects right away because I read some of these terrifying comments right after I inserted the ovule.  I took 2 Advil PM after reading some of these horror stories and by the time the side effects started I was fast asleep.  In the morning however_ I felt horrible itching and burning!  I went to work and was ok and then I got home and the itching and burning was still there.  The 2nd day_ I stil had terrible itching_ burning and some pain.  3rd day_ decreased side effects but still itching and burning. 4th day symptoms decreased significantly but still a slight itchy feeling when I wipe after using the restroom.  I feel so much better though.  I would go through the severe burning and itching all over again to experience the comfort I have now that the yeast infections appears to be going away.  I still use the cream and will continue to use it until it's gone.  I reccommend Monistat 1 day treatment to anyone who wants to get over a yeast infection which alone is a horrible feeling.

The first 2 nights_ it wasn't fun_ I experienced burning and iching_ but it wasn't any worse than the infection its self_ my mother who is a nurse says it burns when first taking it_ because its killing the infection and washing it out_ which is why iching can happen_ but I noticed_ after the first two days the burning stopped_ and so did the iching_ I'm on day 6 now_ and I'm pretty sure my infection is gone.

My infection has not come back yet and even if it did_ i would be happy that atleast i can go 5-6 months without an infection_ compared to before_ im in great shape!! im in love.,F,20, ,6/12/2009,Monistat 7
234, 4, Yeast Infection_ wanted to die!,first night intence itching and some burning.,My yeast infection started about 4 days before i finally decided to use monistat 7. at first i didnt think i had a yeast infection and after the third day i knew it was one_ it was so bad by that time. and i was embarrassed to purchase monistat but me and my boyfriend went to walmart and got it_ about five minutes after applying the cream before i went to bed it itched a lot and started burning a little. when i woke up that morning_ i felt fine. I took it again last night and no side effects! i feel so much better_ but still am going to take it for the whole 7 days!!! it defiantly works_ because before i took it i seriously wanted to die and now i feel good as new.,F,19,3  days,5/16/2009,Monistat 7
235, 1, Suspected Yeast Infection,Horrible burning and itching immediately upon use!,"I've used Monistat products in the past with no problem_ but the last time was probably 10-12 years ago.  Not sure if they've changed their formula_ or if it's me that's changed_ but I will NEVER use this product again!  The burning and itching was so intense I though I would jump out of my skin.  And of course_ once the medication is in there...can't get it out easily.  I finally inserted a tampon_ hoping that it would help absorb the medication.  This brought enough relief that I could relax a little bit_ but it still took several hours for me to feel ""normal"" again.  My advice to anyone that has never used Monistat before is to try some of the cream EXTERNALLY first to test for sensitivity.  It seems_ from reading the comments here_ that women either love it or absolutely hate it.",F,44,1  days,5/12/2009,Monistat 7

I am using Monistat 7 and i seem to have no problems going on in fact i feel better than what i have been. So the people that have used this product and have had severe itching or something else... well it just doesn't decide with your body well. So use another product.,F,15,7  days,5/3/2009,Monistat 7
237, 1, yeast infection,Burning_ pain_ intense itching,"OMG!  The first night I literally thought I would go crazy with the intense itching!  Then the burning.  I used the 3 day pack that comes with the cooling wipes_ cream and ovules.  The cream made the outside of my vagina burn like crazy and then the unbearable itching started. The cooling wipes were nice though but didn't stop the pain. My mistake was inserting the ovule.  Within a few minutes I thought I was going crazy with the itchy burning sensation.  I thought maybe my infection was really bad and it was attacking it.  I cried and hubby said to wash it off but I grit my teeth and made it thru the night.  Next morning the itching was unbearable again and then burning.  That night tortured myself again with another ovule.  The itching subsided a tiny bit but still unbearable.  Third night itching and burning again.  I don't know if I have an allergic reaction or what but I litterally wanted to rip out my vagina with the itching!  I would have gone to ER if I wasn't so embarrassed!  I also tried Vagistat and it didn't burn (the one day treatment box) but it also didn't cure the problem and the box is huge and it is so embarrasing to walk up to register with this huge billboard ""I have a yeast infection everyone"" box!  I was just hoping there wasn't a price check needed!  I go to my doc in a day or two to get another type of treatment as I can't stand the itching and nothing is helping",F,47,3  days,4/17/2009,Monistat 7

239, 5, Yeast Infection,,"I have used Mon7 several times. My 1st time I had a yeast infection_ it was severe. I purchsed the ""Suppository"" 7-day treatment & the yeast infection was cured. I've had 2 other infections since then. This time my cycle came on (I THOUGHT it was an infection) I got the ""cream"" version of Mon-7. Immediately it burned intensely! Also_ I washed myself so much_ I was ""too dry"" & irritated to be inserting the applicator & cream_ I started burning as soon as the applicator touched me. I stopped the Mon7_ took it back & got some vagisil cream. After my cycle_ I thought the ""infection"" was still present because intense itching & burning. I tried Mon-7 again figuring my cycle & over washing caused the bad reaction_ not the product. I found the 3-day ""Suppository"" version again & went to using it. THERE WERE NO SIDE EFFECTS. My gyn doesn't believe I had a yeast infect. to begin w/_ probably just irritation. When I ""Self Diagnosed"" I caused worse problems than before. However_ I too wonder if they have changed something I their products. Fot my last 3 infections I searched for the ""Suppository"" version which worked so well for me in the past.

241, 4, Yeast Infection,I'm on my third night with the medicine (taking my third dose tonight)_ and today I felt a little nauseated and had a fever of 100.5. I am pregnant too. I have had Gastric Bypass (two years out)_ and usually if I have an excess amount of mucous built up in my stomach_ I get nauseated_ feverish_ and I end up vomiting. Sure enough_ it was mucous that was built up (this was after I ate too)_ and after I vomited_ my fever is starting to go down_ and I'm not nauseated any more. So_ since I've had these symptoms before I was pregnant_ and before I started the Monistat 7_ I know the symptoms are not from the medicine.After the first nights dose_ the next day I felt more burning when I urinated. I am using the Combo Pack with the external cream and the internal cream. After my second dose_ I am able to urinate with hardly any burning.,I'm confident that Monistat 7 will continue to work and get rid of the yeast infection. This is my first yeast infection too. I'm 38 years old_ and let me tell ya...this is no fun. LOL I am grateful there are meds out there to help with this. I'm taking the Monistat 7 brand name. Just remember_ everybody's body is different and will react to medicine differently. Continue to monitor yourself while taking this medicine and any other medicine.

242, 4, yeast infection while pregnant,slight burning the first nights,After reading all the comments on this website I was really scared taking monistat 7. However I wanted to get rid of my infection asap and talking to the pharmacist he strongly recommended this product. So the first nights I gotta admit the burning and itching increased every time I applied it. Then I stopped using the so called soothing cream but still took the internal cream. The burning stopped_ my sore skin healed AND I got rid of the nasty yeast infection.

I agree with another poster that_ while I believe that the majority of posters on this page have had the symptoms that they describe_ their stories should be taken with a grain of salt.  I don't think that bad symptoms are at all the norm...most people who have had no reaction to the medication would not go out of their way to post a positive review (i.e._ no news is good news).

256, 1, Yeast Infection,Intense itching and burning,A few people have said that if we're feeling intense itching and burning that it must be the actual infection and not the medication. However_ once you experience it_ YOU KNOW! I had a yeast infection for a few days before I bought Monistat. I inserted the ovule at night and as soon as it started coming out_ I felt the most horrific itching I'd ever had. I did everything I could to get all the medication out but it didn't work. I stayed awake and squirmed for hours. But it was very obvious that the symptoms I felt were caused by the medication. After a few hours_ they subsided enough that I was able to sleep.

259, 5, 3rd yeast infection,No side effects other than normal discharge of the medicine.,I think because I was sick this past week and then proceeded to indulge in excessive amounts of sugar this happened. Prior to purchasing the monistat I used plain yogurt as a cream and that helps ALOT with itching and burning (even if it is messy) it makes me feel better that I don't have a pharmaceutical plant on my vag.

I was so paronoid because this is my first pregnancy as well that I went to the ER on day 2 of the burning. Everytime I inserted it_ I felt like I was burning inside out.. even at the ER I was told to finish the treatment.

I used Monistat years ago and never had any issues like this_ and had to run to the shower to scrub the stuff off due to how unpleasant this was.

264, 1, Yeast Infection,Severe Itching,I have had several yeast infections since my teens.  Within the last few years_ when I take Monistat 7 it causes extreme itching and irritation.  It used to not do this.  Wonder if my body is somehow rejecting it now?  Have to scratch my crotch with a towel until it is completely swollen to get any relief.  It's horrible.  It happens when the cream starts to leak out.  I have found that if put it in right before bed_ so it doesn't leak out_ there's a better chance of not going through the itching as bad.  Last night I put in a half dose and it itches less.  It always gets rid of the yeast infection even if its agony doing it.  Wish there was a better product for yeast.  It's still itching after 3 days.  Will probably stop taking it today...am taking probiotics and hope they will do the trick.,F,36,3  days,9/16/2008,Monistat 7

It is day 1 of the treatment and I won't be doing day 2!!! I will wait the 4 days and try the oral pill again.

Chills and overall bodily discomfort_ brought on by the intense and outrageous itching.,I am thrilled to have found this site_ because I thought I had some sort of awful parasite or something. I have a mild yeast infection caused by antibiotics_ so last week used the Monistat 1-day ovule treatment.  This did not cause major itching or burning (mild itching for a few minutes); but it also didn't quite cure the infection. My mother in law_ a nurse_ suggested I try the 3-day treatment_ so I used the first dose of internal cream tonight and I thought I was going to need to go to the ER. The itching and burning was so severe_ I thought I could potentually claw out my vagina. I sat in the tub with some warm water and baking soda (per a rec from this site)_ but am still not finding relief. It is getting sloooowly better_ but now I am afraid I will be up all night. I have used Monistat 2-3 times in previous years and NEVER had this problem. Is there something new in it now???  I could not live through this experience again!!,F,37,1  days,8/25/2008,Monistat 7
268, 2, AWFUL AWFUL yeast infection.,This is my first yeast infection and it is EXTREMELY itchy and burning. I couldn't even sleep because it was so painfully irritating...so I desperately took a bus to the mall because I wanted relief fast and didn't feel like looking for my health card and waiting for a doctor's appointment. It was just to painful. So I bought monistat 3....I inserted the cream into myself and I felt no burning_ it even got all over the outside of my vagina...and still no burning (other than the burning from my yeast infection). It is now 13 hours later and the itching is gone (sorta) but WOW...there is a strange burning inside of me now...it's really uncomfortable. It feels like fire...and I am actually panicking right now. I have these little red bumps now too...there are on my lower legs (out of all places)..I guess I must be allergic or something. It actually did relieve some of the itching though...so it's like a win/lose situation. I will not be taking anymore monistat and am just going to go to t,,F,22,1  days,8/24/2008,Monistat 7

It was burning and itching to the extreme and it was hours before the burning and itching went away.  Day two was a bit better.  Side effects were mild.  The third day there was no longer any burning and itching feeling inside when inserting the product.  I'm on my fourth day.  I seem to be getting better_ but it does still itch around the outter area and the external cream provided does not really work as well as I expected.

I was better off before I took it.  I called the monistat hotline for additional information_ and was told there have been no reported side effects_ even though this sort of thing is mentioned all over the package.  I was told they could give me no help or information_ but they wanted all sorts of marketing info from me.  monistat 1 is a terrible product that should not be on the market.

I also thought I was having an allergic reaction_ and was wondering how I would remove this substance from my body.  I got on the computer to see if this is a normal reaction.  I can see from all of these posts that others have had the same experience_ so I feel better.  The burning has subsided a little.  I just hope that it finally does the trick after going through some severe discomfort (and a little panic).  I agree with the idea raised above that possibly the product has been modified_ and probably is a higher strength to beat these infections that seem to be a chronic problem for so many of us.,About a week ago I tried Monistat 3_ ovule.  It didn't burn or itch_ but it also didn't get rid of the discharge and itching of the yeast infection.  That's why I tried Monistat 7 cream this time.,F,37, ,7/30/2008,Monistat 7

Honestly_ I was shocked to hear the horror stories reported.  After being diagnosed with a yeast infection_ I immediately purchased Monistat and used both the ovule and cream.  The ovule was very easy to insert and the cream reduced my itching and burning by about 90% in about 30 seconds.  Yes_ I did have the ovule's cream ""ooze"" out after about 4 hours_ but I simply used a pantyliner.  I also spoke to my friend who is a nurse_ and she said that she believes the product ""works wonders"" and has never heard of negative side effects.

I have been suffering from terrible UTI's about once a month_ and all the antibiotics have caught up with me and as a result_ a terriblly painful yeast infection.There was hardly any itching_ just a terrible burning sensation in my vagina...no discharge or anything. Once I took Monistat 3 day_ I was feeling better in less than 12 hours after I woke up_ after taking the first dose. I had no side effects whatsoever...just 100% complete relief...it was amazing!!For everyone who complains of agonizing sidwe effects_ that's most likely your infection_ NOT the medicine...lol. It was a miracle for me. Highly recommend...just use at night w/ a panty shield.,F,21,3  days,2/18/2008,Monistat 7
287, 3, mild yeast infection,during my routine pelvic my doctor found yeasties. she had prescribed a week of Diflucan only to have my insurance not approve it. she called my insurance company and while i was waiting_ i decided to handle it myself. i used the new 3 day ovule (only to find out they are encapsulated in gelatin- not happy since i don't do pork products). the burning and irritation will not happen on contact_ the gelatin has to dissolve first. by that point_ you are asleep (hopefully). any that i got was mild enough for me to ignore-- though i am a heavy sleeper (continued),the next day i had a clear thin discharge which can only mean my body is trying to rid itself of this foreign chemical-- it also causes some vulvovaginal discomfort_ particularly upon urination. that subsides towards early afternoon and by evening i feel like myself again. i have one more dose tonight. i will take it simply on the principal of finishing my meds like a good girl and not creating my own drug- resistant super yeast. though next time_ i will prally go the au natural route with raw l. acidophilous and a hydrogen peroxide (which is naturally produced by the 'good' bacteria in your vagina) douche.,F,27,2  days,12/14/2007,Monistat 7

This time it burned like crazy and created intense itchiness. The side effects lasted about 30 minutes. It seems as though the company must have made a change in the product. I won't be using this again. It doesn't cost me any more to pay a co-pay than it does for me to purchase this product and the pill won't leave me in terrible pain.,,M,34,7  days,12/6/2007,Monistat 7

This makes the whole experience not only more unbearable at times_ but kind of funny in hindsight. Anyway_ the second day of the ""treatment"" my inner lip got way swollen and itched worse than it had before. This worried me but the thing that set my panic attacks off was that it made me begin to bleed. I had a panic attack at work and had to describe my symptoms (embarrassingly) to one of my coworkers. She got a kick out of it. Anyway_ I'd say stick to just going to the doctor to get that diflucawhatever stuff.

292, 2, Recurrent Yeast Infection,Burning_ itching_ rash,I recently developed a yeast infection six weeks ago and after two weeks of putting up with it I went to Planned Parenthood and Diflucan was prescribed. The only symptom I had experienced was intense external vulvar pain. It came back two weeks ago and I ineffectively treated it with Monistat 3. Two days later I started Monistat 7. Halfway through I developed itching and a rash. My symptoms were getting worse so I discontinued  and Diflucan was prescribed again.

I didn't even know I had a yeast infection since I didn't experience any of the common symptoms but my doctor told me that I did and recommended Monistat 7.  I never used this product before (only Vagisil).  I thought I was having an allergic reaction from the burning sensation.  But after discovering this site_ it's clear that I'm not alone.

I immediately went to the doctor and got diflucan instead. The side effects are not worth it. Especially when you have the cream oozing out into your panties all day.,Don't use it if you can avoid it. Just take diflucan.,F,22,2  days,3/23/2007,Monistat 7

If you are reading this and have just started to get the insane burning_ try to get as much of it out as possible.  Get a tampons and push it up there and repeat a few times till you think it's all out.  Also_ my doctor gave me Alevert_ antihistimine_ or you could use Claritin_ this worked really well.  Two days later and I am still sore.  The pain subsided for me after the Alevert.  They should take this stuff off the market!,F,29,1  times,3/21/2007Email,Monistat 7

305, 5, yeast infection,LADIES - If this is your first yeast infection_ you've got to see your gyno! They take a culture and tell you whether or not its a yeast infection - other infections like vaginal bateriosis and Trichomoniasis (Trich) have VERY similar symptoms. If it is actually a yeast infection_ you can then know what to look for in the future. If you take Monistat and other creams when you don't have a yeast infection you can create a resistance that will make it much harder to treat yeast infections you may have in the future! See your gyno the first time - it's painless and quick to do a culture and will save you a lot of grief.,,F,24,1  days,1/8/2007,Monistat 7
306, 5, yeast infection,burning_ itching,I used the Monistat 3 day.  My first application of the external cream caused me great discomfort.  Extreme burning and itching for about 20 minutes.  I began my search on the internet after reading on the package that this cream is soothing and will stop the itch thinking that I was having a bad reaction.  After reading all the comments_ I became very concerned and nervous about using the internal cream that evening for fear of severe pain and itching.  I went ahead and inserted about 3/4 of the cream before bed scared to death of what would occur.  Besides some VERY mild burning I was fine and was able to fall right to sleep and sleep through the night.  In the morning there was no pain or itching while the cream leaked out.  I showered and reapplied the external cream which did not cause any pain or itching this time around.I just wanted to add in my experience as everyone is different.Good Luck!,F,39,1.5  days,1/7/2007,Monistat 7

She recommended monistat 7 and that night_ I applied it as directed and within 10 minutes I had severe itching_ no rashes or hives_ I had a little trouble getting to sleep.  I called my doctor the next morning and she told me that is expected for patients with slight infections_ and there should be no itching the next night.  I used it the next night and finished the week pain free and CURED.

In the past I simply picked up the Monistat-7 or Monistat-3 and after using the product_ all was well. Well...not this time. I caught the infection pretty early on. I only had mild itching and irritation and minimal discharge so I thought I'd head it off at the pass. On the first night_ I had no indication that anything was amiss. However_ the second night_ I woke up after being in bed for an hour with the most intense itching and burning I've ever felt in my entire life! I jumped out of bed and ran to the bathroom with the hopes of pushing this stuff out...to no avail. After about 2 hours it subsided. Well_ the morning brought burning that lasted for several hours. I thought it was a fluke and used the last ovule on Day 3. This was just a more intense repeat of Night 2! It was so bad in fact that I tossed and turned with no relief in sight until I cried!

314, 5, Self-diagnosed yeast infection :-),None,Monistat 7 WORKS. Anyone who says they were woken up by itching_ burning_ or swelling_ and/or claim it was the side effect of Monistat 7 are WRONG; itching_ burning_ and swelling are all symptoms of a really bad yeast infection. Monistat 7 and all other Monistat anti-yeast-infection products help relieve the symptoms but you should not expect miracles: unless you caught the yeast infection early and started using the product_ you will still experience some level of discomfort until one morning you can definitely tell that your condition has improved. The bottom line is: Monistat 7 works when you use it correctly. I have not used other brands_ but I have used the Monistat 1 Day with Ovule capsule. I liked it more because it is less messy_ but sometimes staking all your money (it's more expensive) and hopes on a one-time insertion treatment seems a bit risky. Other than that_ I can say that I trust this brand.,F,23,7  days,7/4/2006,Monistat 7

Since then I""ve tried 7 day_ 3 day_ and 1 day.  All the same bad reaction.  The 1 day was the worst... I had a lot of swelling.  Nasty!  I just talked to a Kaiser doc_ and he claimed in his 30 years practicing ob/gyn he had never heard of monistat causing an allergic reaction.  And then recommended I try it again with hydrocordizone for the itch.  I won't be going to that doctor again.  I don't think he believed me about the allergic reaction_ and I don't think he understood that the itching_ burning and swelling is internal as well as external.",F,37,7  days,6/25/2006,Monistat 7

Finally at some point I developed an allergy to it which I think may have been one of the reasons I had chronic yeast infections. I had burning and abdominal pain. A year later I took it because I couldn't afford a prescription medication at that point and had a repeat of the burning and abdominal pain. I suspect a lot of people are developing immunities to these types of medications.,Overpriced and the amount of product in the tubes has been decreasing over the years. :( I'm angry that women spend so much on a product to get their symptoms under control when they don't have a good alternative (for many people oral anti-fungals are not effective at some point).,F,26,20  times,2/1/2005Email,Monistat 7
