0, 5, Diabetes Type II,The only side effect was blood sugar level was quickly brought down within one to two hours of taking to normal levels_ 80 to 150. I could not take it on a regular basis because it helped control the sugars for several days to several weeks_ so monitored for spikes and took as needed.,Unfortunately could no longer get from my doctor as there was a concern for renal failure in other patients.,M,59,7  years 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Glyburide (micronized)

2, 4, ,No energy_ listless_ felt,I found out that my blood sugar was 479 and the Dr immediately put me on this medicine. At first I felt so tired_ but after a few days it is tolerable. With no insurance at all_ it cost 26.50 for a 30 day supply which was not that bad. I was told by pharmasist to use sun screen and do not prolong in the sun> Since I live in a beach town it is hard to stay out of the sun...but it does make you very sensitive to the sun!,M,44,1  weeks,11/11/2004Email,Glyburide (micronized)
