0, 3, trigeminal neuralgia,constipation_ confusion_ balance,"Looking back_ I wish my MD had been more attentive to the side effects  When I presented in 2012 with severe TN (levels 7-10 pain_ couldn't talk_ no solid food)_ Tegretol provided immediate relief_ without any obvious side effects.Shortly thereafter_ I met a fantastic woman and became engaged.  To merge our families with three kids meant I had to take certain steps in a short period of time_ sell my house and buy a new house for us.  All while also holding a demanding job and going to school part time.  With any complex task_ things got foggy.  Contact a realtor_ get a loan_ fix my credit_ create a list of things to fix in order to sell the house.  I couldn?t do these things.  Tegretol made me into slug.  And my fiance? saw this and began to wonder about me.My MD knew the basics of our situation_ had met my fiance?.  A neurologist_ ""one of the best""_ lots of experience with this drug.  If he had been more compassionate he might have seen what was happening. Ultimately my finance saw what I was doing_ interpreted my actions as meaning that I really didn't want her and the marriage_ and cancelled the wedding five weeks out.  I was angry and confused_ she has moved on_ convinced that there is something wrong with me.My current MD is getting me off Tegretol and will now phase in  other drugs and consider interventional radiology/ electro and/or MVD.  Be very_ very careful with this drug.",M,55,4  years1200mg 3X D,8/3/2016Email,Tegretol

Brain felt heavy_ blocked and retarded. Had many negative thoughts and was low on confidence.,My interest in doing anything was very low. All the time I felt I could not do what I wanted to do. I would forget things easily. Confidence levels were very low but better than when I was taking Phenytoin. Performing any activity took extra effort and would commit many mistakes. Had to struggle to keep myself going. Coupled with a handicap and head injury_ the drug made my life worse.Everyone was saying I was lazy and very slow. Had difficulty in speaking. Could not study well and remembering anything I studied was difficult. Had many negative thoughts about myself.. Had to push myself moment to moment to stay alive and going. had many uncontrolled thoughts_ and used to remember my past everyday. Difficulty in concentrating on the work in hand.

My speech and word recollection are often poor and the onset of these are unpredictable.

51, 5, epilepcy/grand mal seizures,The first time I took tegretol I acted drunk.  It made me feel loopy_ but as time went on my body adjusted.

No bone loss from last bone density test.  Be careful with antibiotics they raise tegretol levels_ especially erythromycin.,I started taking Tegretol when I was 23 years old and basically was given my life back.  I was having seizures every 7-10 days.  With tegretol I have had only 1 seizure in 20 years .  I was monitored for aplastic anemia in the early days which they have now stopped testing for.

52, 5, Epilepsy,"I took carbamazepine to treat my relatively mild temporal lobe epilepsy from 1995 until 2011.  I cannot say I had any bad side affects.  I lead a completely ""normal"" life. My concentration and memory were never good (but not bad either) but at least my seizures (petit mal) became less and less over the years.  I think the drug really helped me.",However! After not having a seizure (petit mal) for over a decade I came off the drug over a period of 3-4 months. Now I'm not sure why but my sex drive (after about 3-4 months off the drug) went through the roof!  I was like a 17 year old boy.    Then one day without warning bang I became impotent! Over night it all stopped (That would be 8 months after I came off the drug completely).  The desire is still there but I no longer can function without the other drugs (and they are now starting to loose their effect)!!!I did find my concentration and memory and confidence also improved considerably after coming off the drug (well the confidence has taken a battering since the new thing)I do find it weird because carbamazepine can cause ED but I never had that problem while on carbamazepine. It was only after coming off carbamazepine that the ED problem started!However ED can be caused by loads of other things(I have been checked out from head to toe. All OK) so its probably a psyc thing (surely coming off carbamazepine did not cause my ED_ could it?)Hope this helps someone (I cannot find anyone else with similar problems).,M,44,16  years400mg 2X D,8/5/2013,Tegretol
