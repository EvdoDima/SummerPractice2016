0, 3, trigeminal neuralgia,constipation_ confusion_ balance,"Looking back_ I wish my MD had been more attentive to the side effects  When I presented in 2012 with severe TN (levels 7-10 pain_ couldn't talk_ no solid food)_ Tegretol provided immediate relief_ without any obvious side effects.Shortly thereafter_ I met a fantastic woman and became engaged.  To merge our families with three kids meant I had to take certain steps in a short period of time_ sell my house and buy a new house for us.  All while also holding a demanding job and going to school part time.  With any complex task_ things got foggy.  Contact a realtor_ get a loan_ fix my credit_ create a list of things to fix in order to sell the house.  I couldnt do these things.  Tegretol made me into slug.  And my fiancé saw this and began to wonder about me.My MD knew the basics of our situation_ had met my fiancé.  A neurologist_ ""one of the best""_ lots of experience with this drug.  If he had been more compassionate he might have seen what was happening. Ultimately my finance saw what I was doing_ interpreted my actions as meaning that I really didn't want her and the marriage_ and cancelled the wedding five weeks out.  I was angry and confused_ she has moved on_ convinced that there is something wrong with me.My current MD is getting me off Tegretol and will now phase in  other drugs and consider interventional radiology/ electro and/or MVD.  Be very_ very careful with this drug.",M,55,4  years1200mg 3X D,8/3/2016Email,Tegretol

Had to struggle to keep myself going. Coupled with a handicap and head injury_ the drug made my life worse.Everyone was saying I was lazy and very slow. Had difficulty in speaking. Could not study well and remembering anything I studied was difficult. Had many negative thoughts about myself.. Had to push myself moment to moment to stay alive and going. had many uncontrolled thoughts_ and used to remember my past everyday. Difficulty in concentrating on the work in hand.

My speech and word recollection are often poor and the onset of these are unpredictable.

52, 5, Epilepsy,"I took carbamazepine to treat my relatively mild temporal lobe epilepsy from 1995 until 2011.  I cannot say I had any bad side affects.  I lead a completely ""normal"" life. My concentration and memory were never good (but not bad either) but at least my seizures (petit mal) became less and less over the years.  I think the drug really helped me.",However! After not having a seizure (petit mal) for over a decade I came off the drug over a period of 3-4 months. Now I'm not sure why but my sex drive (after about 3-4 months off the drug) went through the roof!  I was like a 17 year old boy.    Then one day without warning bang I became impotent! Over night it all stopped (That would be 8 months after I came off the drug completely).  The desire is still there but I no longer can function without the other drugs (and they are now starting to loose their effect)!!!I did find my concentration and memory and confidence also improved considerably after coming off the drug (well the confidence has taken a battering since the new thing)I do find it weird because carbamazepine can cause ED but I never had that problem while on carbamazepine. It was only after coming off carbamazepine that the ED problem started!However ED can be caused by loads of other things(I have been checked out from head to toe. All OK) so its probably a psyc thing (surely coming off carbamazepine did not cause my ED_ could it?)Hope this helps someone (I cannot find anyone else with similar problems).,M,44,16  years400mg 2X D,8/5/2013,Tegretol

65, 4, trigeminal neuralgia,Like many others I have the feeling that I am a space cadet.  So far_ I have not been too aggravating to my family_ friends and co-workers with it.  I try to make a joke of it.  I am seriously bothered by any lighting.  I feel like living in a cave is the answer_ but not very practical.  When I first began in January_ 2012_ the pain from the cold was unbearable. I could quickly understand why it is called the  suicide disease. I have studied about the different procedures to relax the pressure of the blood vessel on the nerve and decided that taking the medication and being a space cadet was the better option.  The condition is disabling and you just have the accept the lifetime condition.  I still work_ drive my car and have a social life_ but none of them are the same.  I have had to cut back on work (took my social security to cut back my hours)_ don't drive too much after dark because of the lights_ and tire out a bit earlier (still can sing karaoke but not in extreme heat or cold),I find that if I do not take my afternoon dosage I experience a more difficult time in the evening (more numbness and pain).  Not much issue with the burning at all now.  I hope to not have to increase my dosage.  And I pray that my friends_ family and coworkers will continue to understand the trigeminal neuralgia and not keep saying I am developing dementia or Alzheimers because the effect of not being able to think of words and repeating myself give them plenty to cause them to think I am at age 64.,F,64,6  months200 mg 3X D,8/5/2012Email,Tegretol

84, 4, trigeminal neuralgia,Dizziness_ NAUSEA_ weight gain_ memory loss_ lose train of though easily_ tired,I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia back in 2004 .This was the first drug I was placed on & it was like a miracle. I guess I didn't pay as much attention to the side effects b/c I was so grateful this got rid of the pain. My dose kept increasing until it just didn't work for me anymore. Tried on another 5 medications and finally in 10/2009 I had microvascular decompression at Univ of Pittsburgh as they are supposed to be one of the best. Surgery was not a success. Left me deaf in one ear_ with a constant sour taste on the side of the surgery_ & weakened swallowing. Resorted to Botox injections from my neurologist_ which decreased amount of attacks but not intensity. I take dilaudid for bad attacks which I just hate everything about. My neurologist (he is also head of the pain clinic) suggested I try tegretol again. He said stranger things have happened & sometimes it can work again. It has been 7 years so I figured why not. Even 6 months of reprieve would be worth it. I cannot believe how sick I am the 2nd time around. Still nauseous after 6 wks & only on 200mg bid. I did have 2 bad attacks in this time_ but that is way less than usual. I want to eat everything in sight. I think it is b/c the type of nausea it causes is like the nausea that comes from being hungry. You think if you eat something the nausea will go away. I started taking 6.25mg-12.5mg of phenergan bid for nausea & it helps somewhat.,F,40,6  weeks200 2X D,8/13/2011Email,Tegretol

The other problem I've noticed so far is when I lean to get something I'll almost fall over_ or difficult to walk in a straight line.

I eventually had to be taken off of it though because I started having low white blood cell counts and this is definitely a side effect of LONG TERM use.

They wanted to start me at 1000 per day but I told the doc that I wanted to start low and dose up if needed.  So far 500 mg. is working (maybe with a little weight gain). The point I want to make is that if you go look at ratings of all of the other drugs I have taken_ everyone reacts differently!  What may work for one doesn't work for another.  My goal was seizure control without side effects.

165, 1, suspected epilepsy,Tegretol causes depletion of sodium (this can be sudden)_ Vitamin D_ calcium_ folic acid and biotin.  Sudden sodium depletion can lead to confusion_ disorientation_ weakness and be mistaken for a psychiatric condition_ with horrific consequences.  Vitamin D depletion mimics many serious physical conditions like neuropathy_ heart arrhythmias_ loss of hearing_ weakened bones and so forth.  I experienced all of this.  I kept being put in seclusion rooms in mental hospitals when I was severely sodium depleted and could have died.  Be careful with this one.  I had to go off of it incredibly slowly_ as faster withdrawal leads to talkitiveness that can be mistaken for mania.,"This drug ruined my career as a psychologist until recently and otherwise seriously limited my life for 20 years.  I know others who have been through this as well.  It causes symptoms similar to bipolar disorder when withdrawn_ ""proving"" that a person is mentally ill and needs tegretol_ like a vicious circle.  I had to get off of it to have a clear enough head to find out what had caused all of this.  With a Ph.D._ I could save myself.

205, 1, Seizure Disorder,I had my first seizure when I was 12 yrs old and I was put on Tegretol. I was not diagnosed with epilepsy but seemed to have seizures around the time of my period. Tegretol_ overall_ did not work for me. The longest I was seizure free on this medication was three months. The side effects included massive mood swings_ nausea (especially in the morning)_ memory loss_ and trouble reading and concentrating. I didn't know that some of these effects were the result of this drug for I myself was too young to understand. I currently have very little long term memory. I seem to have lost many memories from childhood that seem to many to deem from age and time. This is my longest lasting side effect of this medication. It is very frustrating to live with this at times especially when your loved ones share with you their childhood memories. I do not recomend this medication for children.,Following this drug_ I was put on Depakote. This drug has minimal side effects only if given low doses. I have been seizure free for a long time now. I am happy and taking care of myself mentally_ emotionally_ and physically. For those prone for seizures_ I have found that stress control and taking care of one's body is the most important way to remain seizure free with low doses of medication.

It doesn't even treat my bipolar disorder_ it made it worse and added to my OCD and made me sick. I have been severely depressed/manic for the last month of being on it and have felt suicidal. My mother was bipolar and killed herself_ so i know the importance of meds...I will NEVER take this again!

My anti-depressant was also reduced which may be contributing to the side effects.  It is not listed as a drug interaction problem with tegretol so I am questioning my doctors as to why it was reduced.

It took many reports of ""low sodium"" in my periodic bloodwork before one of my doctors saw Tegretol as a possible cause.  My sodium level_ meanwhile_ had dropped dangerously low.  This is not a complaint against the doctors.  It is a complaint that ""hyponatremia"" should have been listed as a potential side-effect in the literature_ so that a doctor could pinpoint the cause much sooner.",F,47,13  years,3/31/2007,Tegretol

It did bring my anxiety down_ but I was always tired which I guess is the point on it (to keep you from becoming manic) however_ I battle with lack of energy and motivation and this never made me feel energetic or wanting to go out and do things.  Was on this for about 3 months and had to get blood tests regularly yet the amount in my blood never got to be the right amount which my pshychiatrist said was odd (when I got blood tests my results were extremely low even after upping the dose) so maybe that's why I didn't get good results.

I'm grateful that I'm not in any kind of pain_ but the exhaustion is debilitating and frustrating because I just can't function for more than 4 or 5 hours at a time_ and even then_ I'm tired.

[Very small prices to pay for freedom.],This is a wonder drug. I had undiagnosed_ uncontrolled complex partial seizures for 12 years before a clever MD figured the epilepsy out and immediately put me on Tegretol. Once I was put on T. it 100% controlled the seizures. I took it through 2 pregnancies (kids turned out totally OK & are grown now)_ and 4 unrelated surgeries.
