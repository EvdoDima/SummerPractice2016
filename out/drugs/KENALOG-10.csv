2, 1, Daughter's eczema,My daughter was prescribed this as a baby. We found out after stopping this that is was causing  difficulty with holding urine at night. I was getting up at night to urinate too because I was the one applying it. My daughter wet the bed at night for years until hit his medication was stopped.  It also contributed to major mood swings and depression in my daughter. Resolved when medication was stopped. It did NOT clear the rash. Essential Fatty Acid supplements and reducing sugar worked better!,,F,8,7  years,9/29/2012Email,Kenalog-10
3, 1, Itchy rash,Greasy_ thick_ slow to absorb. Usual warnings of taking steroids.,This did not work for my itchy rash.  Results lasted only minutes. Because it can only be used sparingly it is not an effective drug for my condition.,F,32,2  days.10 2X D,6/9/2010,Kenalog-10

5, 3, Whiplash/neck & shoulder pain,I was very sore for a few days after.  Could not raise my hands over my head or put my chin to my chest.   My period was two weeks late then lasted 9 days.  Then it quit for five days only to start up again and now I'm on my 14th day again!  Bleeding will act like it is going to stop only to start up full force again.  Flow also has a lot of clots.  Was not aware of these side effects or would not have had it done.  It hasn't been worth it.  I'm tired of having a period!!!,,F,38,1  days,8/28/2007,Kenalog-10
