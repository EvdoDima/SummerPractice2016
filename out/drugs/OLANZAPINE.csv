0, 3, Bipolar II,Diabetes_ 30lbs weight gain_ lack of enjoyment and lack of motivation.,This medication did a great job of treating residual depression_ OCD and intrusive thoughts when combined with Lithium. It slightly helped my anxiety. Did not help panic attacks. However I feel the side effects may not be worth the benefits. I reduced my dose to 2.5mg and my diabetes just disappeared_ but I still have the other side effects. I just sleep and sit around all day_ rarely accomplishing anything and not really enjoying myself much. I wasn't like that before. I will never lose weight as long as I feel like this_ and I need to lose weight. I would recommend taking an alternative medication if possible.,M,35,2  years7.5mg 1X D,4/3/2015Email,Olanzapine
