0, 4, STREP THROAT,It got rid of my sore throat but shortly before the end my stools got mushier and my intestines have been unsettled fpr the last 10 days.,,F,45,10  days 2X D,3/27/2015,Penicillin v potassium
1, 2, tonsillitis,Dizziness_ weakness_ and worst of all.. a yeast infection,This is absolutely ridiculous_ never in my life have I had a yeast infection. Maybe it's worth taking penicillin if you have a really horrible infection in_ say_ a major organ like a kidney or something. But for tonsillitis I think a weaker antibiotic would've worked just fine. I didn't even take it all_ I only took it as prescribed for 4 days before it caused a yeast infection and I quit taking it. Because really_ what's the point in attempting to treat a yeast infection when you still have to swallow the cause of it for 6 more days. So now the tonsillitis will probably come back_ but I don't care. I refuse to take any more penicillin_ it's not at all worth it.,F,23,10  days,5/4/2008,Penicillin v potassium
