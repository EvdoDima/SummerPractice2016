0, 1, Thinning crown,Tiredness_ decrease of sex drive_ pain on testicles_,Only 2 days were enough to feel some side effects of this drug_after first day i could feel a slightly pain on my balls_ nothing too serious but not comfortable for sure. My luck was that i was sexual active by that time_ so at same day i feel something was different in sex_ i couldnt get harder easily and faster like some days ago and it was even painfull sometimes_ it made me confuse because i thought that only Fina would mess up with sexual life_ so i thought it was just something in my mind and i gave it a new try next day but the exactly the same thing happened so i gave up of Minoxidil and i threw it away_ hoping i can get back to my old hard days soon. I'm never going back to that drugs again_ i prefer either to lose my hair or spend more money in a HT but for sure that i don't want to lose my sexual life and be a slave of a drug.,M,29,2  days 2X D,9/3/2015Email,Rogaine (for men)
