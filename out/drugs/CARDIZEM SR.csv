0, 3, angina,Less chest pain_ blood pressure better BUT dry choking cough especially in morning lasting at least 1/2hour. A couple of times I couldn't breathe_ my oesophagus completely closed so I took 2 types of antihistamine which helped. Also the last time I woke up I coughed until I was spitting up blood. I have also recently started on Cpap machine with humidifier. I feel ill and tired and very weak. I would not recommend this to anyone. The benefits do not outweigh the side effects.,,F,53,6  weeks,12/22/2011Email,Cardizem sr
