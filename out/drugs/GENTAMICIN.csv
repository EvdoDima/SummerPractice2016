0, 1, Sinus Infection,nystagmus / severe bilateral vestibular loss / inability to walk a straight line / sleep problems / fear of falling / (and more falls) / can't ride a motorcycle any longer / had to quit working /,This medicine should NEVER be given unless it is a life threatening illness.  Care should definitely be taken with the dosage.  My dosage should have been 80 mg given 3 times per day yet I started on 300 mg per day.  I was lowered to 150 mg per day after about 10 days due to high concentrations in my blood work.  The doctor kept checking on my kidney function but never considered the ototoxicity.,F,43,21  days300 mg 3X D,5/18/2011Email,Gentamicin
1, 1, Clear up peritoneal infection,Loss of equilibrioception (loss of balance)_ Oscillopsia (visual artifacts),Doc overdosed me on this med. I was taking it intraperitoneally while on dialysis. Doc did not mention any chance of side-effects_ did not monitor blood level and after I lost my balance denied the drug had anything to do with. Confirmed with my family doc that I suffered gentamicin toxicity. This drug is very dangerous_ and even more so if you have decreased kidney function. I am also suing my doc. Every step I take_ every time I turn my head_ the effects are present. I'm writing this about 5 months after the incident_ so the results are also permanent!,M,35,4  weeks80 1X D,3/3/2011Email,Gentamicin
