2, 5, crohnes disease,Have not experienced any side effects to speak off_ other than maybe some gas_ but that could be due to the crohnes disease,I have been taking motofen sense 1992_ Its been a godsend_ lomotol wasn't working anymore without takiing it by the handful. I have the entire portion of my elium removed so lots of bm's. There's been some talk about it not being available much longer and it scares me to death.
