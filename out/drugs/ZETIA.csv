13, 1, Elevated Cholesterol,Since I've only been taking it a short period of time_ the side effects are minimal so far but because I've taken Crestor and Provastatin prior to Zetia_ I'm leery of these medicines. I noticed my vision was blurry a few days which seemed weird to me_ especially since I JUST got my new eyeglass prescription in November! I've also noticed I'm more tired than I should be especially since I take an energy tablet_ vitamin D_ B12_ and multi-vitamin DAILY! I attributed the fatigue to the time change_ travel on my job_ and just long hours but it seems more than normal.,After experiencing CRAZY side effects with Crestor (severe muscle pain) and Provastatin (gas and CRAZY & extreme nightmares)_ I am extremely conscious of what's happening with my body so anything out of the norm stands out! My cholesterol is only slightly elevated and has come down since my PCP and I began this journey! I believe I can get the numbers down by other means and will discontinue use of this drug!

17, 1, Cholesterol,Shortness of breath_ dizziness_ constant hunger_ hair loss_panic attacks,Was prescribed this medication in addition to Crestor after having a stent inserted due to chest pain. Trusted my Doctor to prescribe proper meds. I have spent the last decade dealing with dizziness and shortness of breath to the point of being admitted to the hospital for tests which always were fine. Figured it must be the combination of all my meds causing these complaints. About a year ago my insurance had issues with paying for Zetia and in the meantime I ran out...did not take zetia for about a week. EVERY symptom disappeared!! No longer short of breath_ no longer dizzy_ no longer hungry_ hair came back thicker and no anxiety issues. Started taking flax seed oil instead and cholesterol is at an all time low.

I was having problems sleeping_ so bad that I ended up visiting the doctor to ask for sleeping tablets. Took me a year to realise the sleep problems coincided with starting this. I tried taking them in the morning rather than the evening but it made no difference ... So I started taking them every other day and_ lo and behold_ started sleeping every other night!

32, 1, High Cholesterol,Originally noticed what I would describe as a pregnancy style tiredness/lethargy.  Couldn't get out of the funk.  Towards the tail end of the first week my eyes began having difficulty focusing throughout the day.  By the second week I had sporadic tingling in my chest/breast area that continued to increase through week two.  Finally I began feeling pressure in my chest and sighing respirations.  Felt like I didn't have enough air and my chest felt noticeably heavy.  I'm associating it with a panic attack type response.  I've been on two other statins that led to horrible neurological symptoms.   I took Crestor for 5 months and suffered debilitating symptoms for over 20 months after stopping the medication.  No one attributed the side effects to the drug.  It wasn't until I took Pravastatin and within 2 weeks began having similar symptoms to the Crestor that we put two and two together.  I was on the Pravastatin for two weeks and suffered side effects for 5 months.

My mother ended up using a wheelchair any time she needed to walk more than a few steps.  Her right leg became noticeably thinner than her left leg. She saw multiple doctors and specialist_ had numerous and sometimes painful tests - MRIs_ CAT scans_ MRI with myelogram_ EMG_ etc._ testing for multiple diseases and conditions - nothing found.  She went to physical therapy_ was on muscle relaxants_ multiple prescription pain medications_ pain medicine injected into her spine - no relief.  They even did minor back surgery (they said they weren't even sure it would help - it didn't.)  I came across this site and immediately contacted her Dr.  We took her off Zetia 3 1/2 weeks ago and she is a different person today.  She is in therapy now to rebuild & stretch the muscles in her legs & back but she can finally walk. We will see if she regains full function.
