1, 2, Chemo,IV dose of Emend after several minutes produced severe allergic reaction. Felt like insides were swelling then had sensation of falling into a cave. Could see and hear nurses but couldn't respond. Had flushed face_ blood pressure went up and oxygen level down. Lasted for a short time after IV turned off. It's on my list of meds I'm allergic to. Was told it's the first time they ever saw that reaction.,,F,70,1  days,12/29/2015,Emend
