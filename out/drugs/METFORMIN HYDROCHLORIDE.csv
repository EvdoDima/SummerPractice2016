0, 1, Elevated sugar,Never knew when I would unexpectedly vomit or have explosive_ uncontrolled diarrhea. It happened in public several times. Worst drug ever!! Never helped lower my sugar levels either. I was always sweaty and nauseated.I started taking the herb Bitter Melon and it's worked wonders with no horrible side effects,Horrible drug.

Horrible Diarrhea all the time. My quality of life was affected. I couldn't take the pain. The doctors couldn't find anything wrong with me_ tests were all fine.

4, 4, PCOS,Started at lower dose and increased over first 2 weeks to 1500mg.  Initially cause gastro problems (cramping_ nausea_ etc) but only last the first couple weeks.  Changed diet at same time and initially lost 35 pounds_ I've gained some back as I haven't been diligent with diet and exercise.  It helps regulate my blood sugar which is nice.  This illness is difficult to deal with_ I wish there were a better medication.  I do feel better now than I ever have.  Oh_ very important_ different manufactures have not worked for me_ there is a difference.  Currently the manufacture is: Solco Healthcare.,,F,33,3  years1500 1X D,4/26/2012Email,Metformin hydrochloride

6, 3, TTC_ PCOS-like symptoms,Some diarrhea_ nausea,Started taking this medicine about a week ago. Trying to conceive and dr says this will help regulate my metabolism and hormones. Also thinks I should lose 5-10 lbs and this medicine may help. I am just on the line of being overweight_ 165 lbs and 5'6. dr said that if i lose 5-10 lbs my body will just work more effectively and will possibly be able to conceive. taking this along with provera_ and later will be taking clomid to induce ovulation.,F,23, 500 MG 2X D,9/18/2011Email,Metformin hydrochloride
7, 3, Type 2 Diabetes,Bad taste in mouth_ diarrhea_ does not manage blood sugar as well as other products,I take this medication 2 x daily along with 100mg of Junuvia 1 x daily.  I struggle constantly to keep my sugar under control even on a low carb diet with plenty of fluids.  Previously took Actos 1 xdaily and had great sugar levels but was seeing increased weight gain.  Am currently taking prometrium 100 mg 1 x daily that has resulted in further increases in sugar levels.  My general practioners solution was to have me not eat 1/4 cup of fresh fruit at lunch and put me on insulin...my solution I'm going to find an endrocrinologist and talk with someone who understands my condition and can help me develop a plan to help me have better control.,M,54,3  years1000 2X D,5/20/2011Email,Metformin hydrochloride
8, 5, Diabetes,I had some diarrhea for a couple of weeks when I first started taking this medication_ but it quickly subsided.  (I started with 500mg 1 x day.)  I think it's a quality drug for treating diabetes.  My body has absolutely no side effects from it.  Anyone who is just starting and having diarrhea or other gastric-type disturbances_ hang in there.  Once your body becomes accustomed to it_ I think you'll find that it will subside.  Then you'll have a good medication that doesn't make you go low and controls your diabetes.,,F,57,11  years1000mg 2X D,3/30/2011,Metformin hydrochloride
9, 3, Type 2 Diabetes,METFORMIN does control my blood sugar levels somewhat.    I still have to inject some insulin 3X daily_  though.    I'm getting readings in the neighborhood of 110--131  (not great_  but not too bad).    METFORMIN causes wild_  explosive_  copious  diarrhea which can come on suddenly and without notice.   You simply have to be near a bathroom at all times to avoid frightful accidents.     Any food you eat passes right through you in less than 5-6 hours.,"I observe  METFORMIN having  three  other side-effects for me:1).   a mild dysthymia  (ie._   can put me in a mild_   funky_   listless_  apathetic   mood).   Thank God for my Zoloft and Seroquel to keep my mood up.2).   It dulls my sense of taste somewhat;   ""good"" food often just doesn't taste very good.   I'll sit here and  gnaw on food that just seems flavorless.   As a result_  I find myself seeking piquant/sour flavors just to have some taste in my mouth: pickles_  mustard_  salsa_  children's  sour candies.3).   It is somewhat stimulating_   causing me to wake too early sometimes.",M,47,3  months2000mg 1X D,11/13/2010Email,Metformin hydrochloride
10, 4, high fasting readings,None.  This medication has lowered my fasting sugar numbers with no side effects at all.  TEVO is the manufacturer (not sure if that makes a difference.),,F,44,6  months500mg 1X D,7/8/2010,Metformin hydrochloride
11, 1, PCOS_ Insuline resistance,Horrifying diarrhea_ made controlled IBS symptoms much worse.Abdominal cramping_ fatigue_ running to bathroom all day long and during the night.,I can't leave the house. I'm a prisoner living in my bathroom. Am using a very low carb diet_ which I hope will help in losing weight_ (have lost none on this drug)_ then can lower the dosage or get off of it entirely. I asked my doctor to let me off of this drug as I am in the bathroom over 6 or 7 times a day_ (as many as 10 time daily) sometimes more and she said no. She offered another drug for insulin resistance_ but it also has Metformin in it. The pain that goes with the diarreah is terrific and I'm so worn out by noon everyday after going to the bathroom so many times. Afraid to eat anything_ including healthy foods because it seems as soon as I eat_ I'm in the bathroom again. Body isn't even using the full dosage as it floats in toilet bowl several hours after taking the dosage. (sorry to be so vivid). I can't travel_ run errands_ go out for a meal_ or visit friends because I don't know how bad it will be any given day. Using heating pad on my belly to sooth the pain. Drinking plenty of water_ but even that can result in a flare. What makes me angry_ is that this drug has been proven to work_ it is economical and easy to get_ however_ the side effects are so debilitating that patients stop using it becuase they can't live their lives. Why don't the drug companies recognize this and DO SOMETHING about it? I know my doctor wont_ she thinks it's fabulous and her only suggestion was liquid Metformin which is not available in the USA. Will keep trying to lose weight_ then,F,48,5  months1000mgs. 2X D,5/15/2010,Metformin hydrochloride
