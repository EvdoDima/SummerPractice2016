2, 4, depression_ anxiety,Yes_ it's true that I've taken this medicine for over 15 years. Took a much higher dose initially (60 mg)_ but then tapered off to 10 mg/day (w/ option of 20 mg during high-stress times). It has been very effective for me--stopped or slowed down the panic attacks and increased my feelings that I could cope with my stressors. Eventually seemed to slowly help lift the black cloud surrounding me.  Few bad side effects_ except chronic constipation. Fortunately_ way less noticeable negative effect on sexual function_ unlike the SSRI's I tried initially.,,F,50,15  years10 mg 1X D,2/9/2016,Pamelor

17, 2, Spectrum Headaches,I have suffered from major depression and anxiety for a long_ long time and have been doing very well for over a year now with 200mg Zoloft 200mg Lamictal and 3mg Klonopin. I had a concussion after falling in late Sept 13 and started having daily headaches. I started seeing a neurologist for help and Pamelor was prescribed because most headache meds have caffeine or stimulants which I highly allergic to. He said that this medicine had several other uses than just treating depression. He was not at all clear enough that combining this with my Zoloft was bad news. I have horrible dry mouth_ confusion_ and lethargy. I feel like I have the flu without the UPR and vomiting. I'm not going to take it anymore.,,F,34,2  weeks25-50 MG,2/16/2014Email,Pamelor

19, 1, Depression,Rapid weight gain (~10 lbs in about 2 weeks),Haven't experienced any benefit since it has only been 2 weeks. But I am stopping now that I have connected it to insatiable appetite for carbs & sugar. Plus_ I feel even more depressed about the sudden weight gain. I was so down when it was prescribed that I forgot to ask about possible weight gain and I didn't even look this drug up on the internet until today.Well_ time to find a form of exercise....,F,39,2  weeks50 mg 1X D,12/24/2013,Pamelor
20, 5, Chronic Major Depression,Dry mouth_ sugar cravings...wt gain_ constipation_ crazy dreams with dose changes--only lasted 1-2 days.,"Pamelor (Brand name med----not generic) was the medication added to Zoloft 200mg and Wellbutrin SR 450mg that took me out of my deepest depression_ allowed me to sleep soundly and be refreshed in the am_ and just provided me the ability to function with ease and a positive sense of well being.  Unfortunately there are side effects; however I had trialed 30 + medications and various med combinations over a painful 8 year time period; Pamelor was what it took to find normalcy. (no more crying_ depressive/suicidal thoughts_ irritability or insomnia.)  Sorry to hear everyone else's experiences; but if it wasn't for this drug (part of my ""cocktail"" of 3 antidepressants)....I simply wouldn't have made it this far into my life. Age 44. As of today_ my pharmacy can no longer obtain the drug!! My back up plan with 90% effiectiveness is a compounded form of Nortriptyline (generic form of Pamelor).  Find an integrative doctor willing to prescribe ""Nortriptyline from a compound pharmacy.""  They only use the ""Nortriptyline"" ingredient and no binders within the capsule form..........it's made all the difference in the world; but nothing beats the real Pamelor.  I don't know why_ but generic meds are ineffective compared to the brand name for me. Trusting compound pharmacy I highly recommend--- Abrams Pharmacy in Texas.

21, 5, Migraines,I was originally on 100 mg but after 10 years i went to 50 mg. I was put on it for migraines when i was 4 months pregnant . I have had reduced migraines from taking pamelor. The only real side effect i had was for every 50 mg i took i gained 15-20 lbs.every time I have tried to go off of it the daily migraines have come back. It is supposed to make you tired but most meds i have an opposite effect of it so after i take it i have about 4 hours of energy. I have found to take it around 7;00 each night works best for me.,I have tried several other migraine meds to help with my migraines and this is the first one that i have not grown immune to after a period of time.I have suffered from Migraines since i was four.,F,46,20  years50 mg 1X D,11/5/2013Email,Pamelor

23, 5, Migraine prevention,Dry mouth (chewing gum helps)_ decrease in migraine frequency from 21/month to 3/month_ decrease in intensity: now manageable with Excedrine and feverfew. Hot flashes down by about 70%.  Sleep very well now so I am more focused during the day.  I exercise and eat vegetarian so weight is not a problem.,I started at 10 mg/day but not effective.  Increasing to 50 mg/day (I am 110 lbs) taken nightly has been amazing.  Pamelor also takes the edge off_ I don't feel stressed out at work and don't lose my temper anymore.  I think that this new situation where I am finally in control of my migraines has made me feel better about myself and not as helpless as I used to feel.  I highly  recommend trying it.,F,50,5  months50 mg 1X D,7/3/2013,Pamelor

28, 1, Major Depression,Irritability_ elevated heart rate (constantly over 110 bpm_) and increased suicidal thoughts,My doctor switched me to Pamelor because I was still having occasional suicidal thoughts on my old antidepressant. I became extremely irritable on Pamelor_ but the worst part was that my suicidal thoughts increased tremendously once I began the Pamelor. It got to the point where_ if I was awake_ I was thinking about dying. I had a plan in place and intended to use it. Thankfully_ my therapist got me to the hospital before I was able to carry it out. If she hadn't_ I probably wouldn't be here writing this review. Also_ the doctor in the hospital informed me that it's very easy to overdose on Pamelor and that it can be fatal. My prescribing doctor did not mention that at all.  This drug was VERY BAD for me....almost lost my life on it!,F,33,1  months50mg 1X D,12/24/2012Email,Pamelor

30, 1, Depression,I would absolutely NOT recommend this medication.  I'm appalled as to why the FDA even allows this drug. I've experienced weight gain of 10 pounds after only 3 weeks on this drug_ loss of libido and sex drive & caused me to have  mood swings where I'd be punching myself in the face.  I have trouble falling asleep at night then difficulty getting out of bed in the morning.,,M,35,3  weeks20mg,11/18/2012,Pamelor
31, 1, Anxiety/headaches,I took it for 12yrs and it helped my anxiety and headache issue like a charm however I was very over emotional during that time and quick to fly off the handle. I didnt realize this until I went off of it last year due to increase heart palipitation that began and have since stopped since going off this. I have longterm affects from this drug_ although my severe constipation i had during that time  I was on it has cleared up thank goodness I have lots of urinary and stomach problems since stopping this. I feel as though this medication and  its drying affect on the system created these over the long period of time i took them but didnt realize it due to nortriptyline being a pain receptor. However as soon as i went off of it everything hit me full force_ constant uti's_ kidney issues_ pancrease issues everything in my stomach just went to hell and a year later I am still batteling this_ Ive only had one doctor say that he thinks that because of the pain recepting propertys of this drug,,F,45,12  years10mg 1X D,10/25/2012Email,Pamelor

35, 1, Migraine,I was very drowsy but as that wore off I was very agitated and I was hearing voices in my head. My ears won't stop ringing now. I don't know if I will ever be back to normal.,This is a scary drug. Here are some of its side effects.Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth_ face_ lips_ or tongue); blurred vision or other vision changes; changes in sex drive; chest pain; confusion; constipation; fainting; fast_ slow_ or irregular heartbeat; fever; frequent or difficult urination; hallucinations; impulsive behavior or other unusual changes in behavior; jaw_ neck_ or muscle spasms; mental or mood changes (eg_ increased anxiety_ mood swings_ agitation_ irritability_ nervousness_ restlessness); panic attacks; ringing in the ears; seizures; severe dizziness or drowsiness; sore throat; stomach pain; suicidal thinking or behavior; swelling of the testicles; tremor; trouble sleeping; trouble walking or keeping your balance; twitching of the face or tongue; uncontrolled movements of arms and legs or stiffness; unusual bleeding or bruising; worsening of depression; yellowing of the skin or eyes.How could the FDA allow this poison on the market?,M,57,3  days50 1X D,6/18/2012Email,Pamelor
36, 4, Depression / Tension Headache,Intense sedation .... dizziness when standing ... light headedness .... low sperm ejaculation .... extended orgasms.,I was prescribed this for headache/chronic pain in my neck/head and major depression from having been sick for years.  This drug for me worked great_ not so much for my headaches but for the deep refreshing sleep it gave me to cope with the pain.  It also lifted my depression and gave me extended orgasms.  The only weird side effect was reduced sperm output during ejaculations.  I would probably be dead if not for Pamelor.  It really brought me out a sever depression.  I guess for some people it works on headaches_ but for me not so much.  Desipramine on the other hand works good for my headaches but ruins my sleep cycle.,M,46,10  years275mg 1X D,4/27/2012Email,Pamelor
37, 1, Anxiety/depression/insomnia,This was recently added by my doc to supplement Zoloft 200mg and Klonopin 3mg. It was supposed to help me sleep. At first it was ok_ but now I've noticed an increase in anger_ anxiety_ I'm shaky_ queasy and it has never helped me sleep the night.  I have horrible_ graphic_ vivid dreams and nightmares when I do sleep.  It has sent me in to full blown panic attack mode and I am refusing to take it anymore.,,F,30,4  weeks50mg,2/25/2012Email,Pamelor
38, 3, Neropathy Pain\NMO,PRO: Cuts pain over time and increased dosages (10mg to 75mg)CON: Rapid weight gain_ loss of strength_ water retention_ increased appetite_ poor\no erections_ loss of sex drive_ bloating_ fatigue_ very  moody when starting and stopping medication,Cuts the pain all though you won't feel/know it for some time_ as it is a gradual process. It cuts nero-pain by tweaking the sodium channels in your cells.  This causes you to hold more water and have rapid weight gain (20lbs - 30lbs).  Somehow_ the increased fluids around the nerves and muscles improves nerve conduction and lowers pain.The more I took_ the less pain and strength I had.  I went  from 240lbs to 290lbs in 3 months.  At 75mg_  I needed a lot of help_ especially getting up and down. Less strength and 50lbs heaver was hard on my wife.  I had to move to 50mg to function and later to 25mg_ as the side effects were still to  much for me. I have wined myself off completely after 1.5yrs. When you stop it causes a wicked rebound in pain for a few weeks.  It takes awhile to get through the withdraws and adjust to your old pain level.  Drink lots of water during this time_ as it helps.  I also  used Valium (PRN) and weed in the evening for pain. It did cut the pain_ second best after marijuana_ but the cost was too much and I still needed weed. I can live and function as a pot head_ but Pamelor made me a weak_ fat_ blob and I can't live like that.,M,47,18  months75 1X D,1/9/2012Email,Pamelor

When stopped first two stopped but have had progessively malfunctioning gastrointestinal system since.  Now age 52 lower GI pretty much doesn't function without  pain_ strain_ more pain.  Had no issues whatsoever with this_ perfectly normal until took Pamelor_ ever since lower GI/bowel has gotten worse and worse.

Increased appetite that i love,Pamelor so far is working amazing for me i cant believe it.  I used to get 3 or 4 headaches a day and have to drink caffeine to take them away.  i was on excedrin every day about 6 pills a day for headaches and then i quit the excedrin and got headaches everyday for 2 months.  then the doctor gave me pamelor and it started working within 2 weeks.  my life has got so much better and i can do stuff now.  im so glad this worked. i still do get little headaches sometimes but they go away pretty quick. now all i drink is a espresso with little caffeine in the morning and keeps the pressure off my head.,M,30,3  weeks50 1X D,6/24/2011Email,Pamelor

Pamelor doesn't effect my libido_ which is great_ but the anti-depression side is questionable. I have mornings when I really wonder if I'll make it through the day.

NOTHING my doctor perscribed would make them go away. Finally when I saw a neurologist he perscribed the Pamelor and four weeks later I've been completely headache free for almost a week now.

I was supposed to start at 10mg each night and increase to 100mg a day. when I reached 30mg my headaches decreased greatly_ so I stayed at 30mg/day. my mouth is very very dry all of the time & Im constantly drinking water because of it_ wake up in the middle of the night choking bc of dry mouth. no bowel movements for days which decreases my appetite_ but also gave me heartburn (which I never had before) also bc of the constipation if I went to many days without movement I would throw up bc I was so backed up. gained a little weight but kept it maintained by working out more than usual. bc it changes your hormones it fought with my birth control and would cause acne_ but did make menstration a lot better for me! the effects of this were worth it.

56, 5, Nerve Pain,I do not feel sleepy_ in fact I seem to be more energetic. It has curbed my appetite...I have lost 5 lbs already. I crave vegetables like crazy! I have dry mouth like crazy_ but if I brush and mouth wash it helps. Dry mouth is bad for your teeth and most pain meds/anti dep. cause this so up your dental care_ as it promotes bacteria to grow as there is no salivia to help wash it away! As for the pain...it has helped IMMENSLY! I seem to be a bit more emotional_ but not in a bad way.,I also take a low dose of Celexa (10 mg) which made me gain 20 lbs. over the last two years. For some reason they work well together and I have stuck a pefect balance. I am able to reduce my pain medication as not as much is needed any more. I am optimistic that the results will continue. I was very worried about weight gain as most people talked about that_ but so far I have lost 5 lbs. Also_ it has not affected my bath room habits one bit. Again_ I cannot stress enough that proper dental care is paramount when on any medication. The bacteria in your mouth gets below the gum line to cause periodantal disease. Learn from my mistake! I have to see a dental hygentist ever 3-4 mos to keep from falling out. Scary!PS The reason I am on all these meds is that I was in a terrible car accident many years ago that cause some pretty bad long term damage.

Gabapentin and alprazolam helped mitigate the anxiety. I stopped taking it over a year ago- It had outlived its usefulness.I mistakenly thought it contributed to a urinary problem (most likely was a separate- age related issue)  However_ the drying effects of this drug can mess with your digestive and urinary system.

67, 4, MS Related Symptoms/ Depression,None really_ besides dry mouth and skin sensitivity to sun.,Pamelor took over 8 months to start working_ but it was the first drug that my body received well_ without any serious side effects. My neurologist told me to hold tight and be patient for it to start working. I started on 10 mg and worked up to 100 mg. Now my psychiatrist added 25mg to ease some of my depression.I was on 200 mg of gabapentin for over a year (it worked great)_ and then it started making me violently throw up every day. I also used to take topamax until I started having tons of weird nightmares. Overall_ I am happy to have relief with Pamelor. Now most days my body is free of tingles_ and the nerve pain is reduced greatly. I have added a lot of vitamin supplements as well_ and my new psychiatrist is having me take EKG's and blood work to make sure the drug is not causing any harm to the rest of me. The dry mouth just causes me to drink more water_ so I am happy about that.,F,29,1.5  years,12/28/2009,Pamelor
68, 1, Depression,The side effects were terrible.  It turned my skin an awful dark color.  The worst side effect was enormous hostility.,Pamelor did relieve the depression but at an enormous cost: I want from being angry and irritable to being extraordinarily hostile.  The hostility persists long after I have stopped taking the drug.  Something in my brain was knocked out of balance and never returned to normal. I truly understand--without condoning--why people on antidepressants shoot up schools or something.  These drugs can have some really bizarre effects.  It also gave me brutal PMS and insomnia for the week before and the week during menstruation.  These effects lasted for YEARS after I stopped taking the medication. ,F,50,6  months,12/23/2009,Pamelor
69, 3, migraines,I started taking pamelor after my previous preventative was no longer effective.  For the first month I had a tremendous amount of relief.  I experienced a migraine-free period for the first time in 15 years!! After the first month was over_ the migraines came maybe 3 times a week.  I am now on Day nine of a migraine..I stopped taking it 2 days ago because my blood pressure was very high and wouldn't lower.  I have experienced horrific dry mouth_ weight gain_ grogginess_ extreme nausea_ acne around menstral time(which is abnormal for me)and moodiness! I was disappointed that its effectiveness seemed to wear away after a month or so.  I am not a fan..,,F,35,3  months,11/17/2009,Pamelor
70, 3, migraines and nerve damage,The biggest side effect i have seen is weight gain. I gained about 10 pounds within the first month (20 mg). I joined a gym_ going daily_cut my caloric intake and still gained another 10 pounds in about 3 weeks after upping my dose to (30mg).None of my clothes fit and i have plan on trying something else_ I am not comfortable with this weight gain and starting to feel like i am failing- even though i work out daily (55 min cardio)! I notice my weight gain a lot in my abdomen_ not sure if theres any relation but even after 4 kids i havent ever carried weight there till now.,it took a few months to work for my migraines but i noticed within a week that my nerve pain was cut by like 75 percent.,F,30,3  months,10/9/2009,Pamelor

No other side effects noticed!,I have been taking Nortriptyline (generic Pamelor) for about 2 months. I started at 10mg at night and have worked up to 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night (50mg total). Each time I adjust dose I am tired for a few days but then that side effect goes away. Continue to have very strange dreams since day 1. Not bad dreams just weird. I have noticed a slight reduction in Anxiety and Depression but not much improvement with migraines. Will continue at this dose for a while to see if it improves. This medication is worth trying_ side effects are much milder than many other medications I have been on. Start low_ work up slow!

74, 4, Depression and Anxiety,In the first week I experienced dry mouth and severe constipation (I required prune juice and Coloxyl with Senna to address five days of no movement). This reoccurred after a dose increase but isn't significant any more. I do experience weird dizzy sensations (I feel like I'm falling even if I'm sitting down) occasionally but they're not a result of standing too quickly_ so I'm not sure of their cause. They're not severe though; just a little unsettling. I take my dose at 9pm each night and when I go to bed at 11pm_ I don't feel sedated at all. I have not experienced any sexual side effects. An antidepressant that works without sexual side effects...Wahoo!,I've tried Zoloft_ Aurorix_ Avanza_ Efexor_ Pristiq and Cymbalta. Of those_ only Efexor was effective_ but it lost its effectiveness. My doctor advised that nortriptyline is the only of the secondary amines available in Australia_ so I decided to try it. I took 25mg the first night_ then 50mg for a week and have been on 75mg nightly since. Unlike with Efexor_ my emotions aren't blunted; I just feel like I'm in a natural good mood most of the time. I still feel emotions strongly when appropriate_ but I don't feel down for no reason and my energy/motivation has improved. I don't sleep as well as I did on Efexor_ but I don't feel tired during the day. To think I avoided the tricyclics all these years and the first one I try is effective with fewer side effects. Don't rule them out - nothing compares to their efficacy for major depression.,M,33,4  weeks,7/30/2009,Pamelor
75, 4, Anxiety and Depression,Dry mouth and constipation,As a teenager I was on this medication for a few years and I seem to recall that it worked quite well.  My doctor was a little hesitant to prescribe this since it's considered an 'old school' anti-depressant; however_I've never been able to tolerate the SSRIs or SNRIs so she finally agreed to let me try it again.  So far so good.  I've had few side effects and I'm nowhere near as anxious as I was before.  I do find that it works better when I take the full 50mg at bedtime otherwise I'm drowsy in the a.m.  This is a welcome relief from the SSRIs which made me feel wired but tired all the time.,F,32,6  weeks,7/20/2009,Pamelor

There are nights where I don't fall asleep till the middle of the night and have to wake up for work by 6. This medication has helped my migraines by 95% I normally would have one everyday and now I have one maybe once a week sometimes I don't have them at all.

(which didn't help the weight gain) Also_ very sensitive to heat and my head would sweat under my hair.,Pamelor would knock me out when I first started taking it.  Even five years later_ I slept very deeply and had a hard time waking up in the morning.  If I had to be up super early for some reason_ I had to skip the previous night's dose or take it in the late afternoon or I'd never wake up early enough.  I have stopped taking it over the last six weeks or so.  It did help so much with my anxiety and panic disorder.  I would recommend it despite all of the side effects to someone with that diagnosis.,F,40,8  years,5/7/2009,Pamelor

I quit cold turkey about a weak ago and already lost 7 pounds_ although I feel like im schizophrenic now cause I hear things in my head and am always dizzy. weird stuff. my doctor has been increasding my dosage but my blood tests reflect that the amount of nortryptiline in my blood is decreasing.

Often feel jittery (like too much coffee).  A lack of sex-drive (not good !),"Because Nortriptyline is taken in conjunction with a regime of Neurontin it is difficult to distinquish which med is causing which effect.

I am now gradually lowering the Pamelor and am finding that the drug seemed to ""blunt"" my emotive state.  I am feeling different now that I am down to about 20 mg_ in a good way.  Now if I could just get through to the other side of menopause!",F,50,2  years,3/10/2008,Pamelor

110, 2, Migraine Preventiona,Weight Gain; Hair Loss; Overheating/sweating,Only only taking 20mg_ but have not observed any discernable improvement in my migraines.  I would be willing to keep trying by increasing the dosage if I wasn't so scared of these side effects.  I'm not sure that being a fat_ bald woman is a good trade-off for being rid of migraines.  To be fair_ I went off of Topamax which made me lose weight_on to Depakote for a few months and then to Nortriptyline...so I can't say how much of the 20lb weight gain is attributed to the Nortrip.  But the hair loss has to be from the Nortrip and it is getting out of control.,F,30,3  months,2/12/2008,Pamelor

I wasn't quite sure why I was having such dry mouth attacks_ but chocked them up to high sugar (I'm diabetic). When I checked my sugars and they were fine_ I remembered I was taking a new medication and took a look here and found that Pamelor had to be the reason. Now I see that it's probably the reason for my sudden weight gain and constipation. I can't seem to drink enough water to quench my thirst_ but the thirst isn't really anywhere but in my mouth_ so drinking isn't actually the remedy anyway. I've been on medication that caused weight gain and I don't want to go down that road again. I've given those clothes away. I'm currently on 50 mg and will be going to 75 mg next week. Not sure what to do if I keep gaining.,F,47,2  months,2/8/2008,Pamelor

So if you get sugar cravings_ grab a bowl of cereal and skim milk.,I've been on A LOT of meds to help treat my anxiety. SSRI's and Benzos don't agree with me and I wasn't sure what else to take. This worked. It took just a few weeks. Maybe 3-4 to feel a change. Probably 8 weeks to feel considerably better. A few months ago I thought my life was over. Now I can feel calm. I can feel joy.

It does help me sleep a little better at night and I have managed to not gain any weight while taking it (I think this is related to my high fiber diet_ since I can hardly exercise at all due to nerve pain and chronic tendinitis. I'm skinny but with zero muscle tone_ strange because before all this I was in great shape).  I've realized lately that the nortriptyline really hasn't helped the depression or the pain for that matter_ and even though I tried upping my dose from 10 mg to 25 mg_ all it did was make me incredibly drowsy.

Anyway_ after the nortryptilan working really well for 18 months or so_ my migraines have returned to their original frequency_ and are becomeing more intense_ as well.  So_ maybe I am developing a tolerance for it?  Maybe I should up the dose?     I am concerned about increased constipation_ which is uncomfortable and unhealthy.

Sometimes it works_ sometimes it doesn't. If I take it when I'm not tired at night_ it tends to keep me awake. It seems to work best when I am already tired. It makes me really sluggish during the day also. You're supposed to stay out of the sun while taking this medication_ but it's kind of hard for me to do since I'm in college.

Did not want to go back on it because I did not like the zoned out feeling was worried what 20mg would do.  Out of desperation I did it (20mg) and  the Zoned out period only lasted one week.  Does not drug you up or knock you out  for the night like ambien or Terazapan.   It simply helps you fall back asleep if you are awaken in the night.  Does not stop ringing in ear_ but helps me not notice it as much (seems more distant).  Have been on it one month and am still sleeping great_ no longer zoned out at all.  No weight gain or food cravings at all at this dose.,F,38,1  months,1/2/2006,Pamelor
162, 4, fibromyalgia,started w/50mgs. Made me very sleepy (still does). I was surprised to get some pain relief in shoulders & leg. No relief for back pain. It wears off quicker now & I don't get the same relief. Tried doing 100mg & it was too much! It's the first med I've had for fibro that has worked. ssri's have not worked for me.,,F,44,8  months,11/1/2005,Pamelor
163, 4, Constant Headaches,Can not sleep.  Makes my body tense.  I just started about 1 week ago at 25mg.  Can't sleep.  I want to switch to taking it during the day_ but must check with Doc since warning label says do not take during day if you normally take at night.,So far_ it has helped my headaches.  I'd say about 80% effective.  I get headaches after reading too much.  It only takes 30 minutes of reading for me to get horrible headache that lasts for days.,M,48,7  days,10/25/2005Email,Pamelor

165, 4, Atypical facial pain,Tiredness - mostly overcome with time.,Now trying to withdraw from several years of taking 25 mg/day and the withdrawal symptoms are hard to live with.  GI disturbances_ gas_ chronic gut noises_ headache_ restlessness.  You are supposed to slowly decrease the dosage_ but when you are taking the minimum and the drug is in capsule form there is no way to go but cold turkey.,M,73,2  days,7/14/2005,Pamelor
166, 4, Severe anxiety_ migraines_ depressi,dry mouth_ heart palpitations_ constipation_ carb craving_ nightmares (now decreasing),Finally I have found some relief of my SEVERE anxiety after numerous failed trials w/newer antidepressants (SSRIs).

167, 2, Migraines and depression,Severe dizziness and lightheadedness_ nausea_ stomach ache_ abdominal cramps_ constipation_ loss of appetite_ aggravated my tachycardia (I have SVT)_ drowsiness during the day_ insomnia during the night_ muddled thoughts_ difficulty concentrating,This medicine did not decrease my migraines at all_ and the only effect it had on my depression was causing my moods to seem more stabilized - stabilized at depression.  I took 50mg per day_ I tried taking it in the morning and the evening_ and splitting up the dose_ it still caused me severe drowsiness (I was practically a narcoleptic) during the day_ and inability to sleep at night.  I would not recommend taking this medication if you have SVT and are not on a medication to treat it.,F,16,1  months,6/28/2005Email,Pamelor
168, 4, migraines,continuous weight gain; first several days/weeks:spaced-out and trouble concentrating; some constipation,Success with Pamelor in general_ but over this past year have had to increase my dosage twice. It seems to wear-off after some amount of time and I keep having to add pills to my dosage. I am now taking 4 pills at bedtime and have begun having fairly perpetual migraines again (a bit less intense then pre-Pamelor_ though) and would like to try a new medication.  Also_ the weight-gain hasn't stopped and that is very frustrating for me.,F,29,1  years,5/30/2005,Pamelor

173, 2, Insomnia_ pain_ some anxiety,Dry mouth_ some constipation,Supposed to be quite sedating.  Did nothing for insomnia or pain.  I think it helped mood a little bit (since it is a tricyclic antidepressant)_ but had side effects.  Gave up on it.,M,49,6  weeks,1/17/2005Email,Pamelor
