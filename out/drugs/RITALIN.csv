I feel tired and pissed off. Just had a coffee to see if that helped wake me up a bit. I have so much to do today and I totally can't be bothered_ don't even want to go for a walk (think i should force myself though) I am supposed to meeting friends but I don't want to now as feel scattered and can't be bothered talking (which is not normal for me at all)... feeling of being in no mans land. I also take Lamactil but I hate this feeling of being on drugs...this is the feeling I used to have when I took crap party drugs years ago and hated that then too...due to take my second one for the day in about an hour so see how I go... fkn over it to be honest.

5, 3, Have ADD,,While on Ritalin I become obsessive about my school work. Idle conversation in class angers me as I feel like I'm wasting my time. I also get a crippling sickness/pain in my stomach whenever I think about something that worries or troubles me I.e. An assignment that I turned in that wasn't up to scratch or a problem I'm having with a mate. Once thinking about head things_ it then becomes very difficult to forget about them and I often get trapped in a cycle of anxiety and worried thoughts. I also don't interact with my friends at lunch anymore. I prefer to sit by myself. Finally_ at the end of the day or even simply between dosages_ I often get feelings of emptiness. I am however writing this while not on the drug. An hour after taking my 20mg dose I would instead be writing about how amazing the focus and motivation that Ritalin gives me is. While on Ritalin_ work is probably the most appealing thing in the world. I could sit down with headphones on_ working away_ for hours on end and be ecstatic in doing so. Everything is interesting and every piece of work feels advantageous to complete. Maths feels particularly rewarding - something about the structure and repetitiveness of the subject is simply captivating while on the drug. There are still bad moments though as mentioned before. _ I may for example feel rritated I am that my French teacher spoke to the class all lesson rather than letting me work monotonously with pen and paper.

10, 5, behavioral/academic issues,Appetite suppression.  Difficulty getting to sleep.  Occasional anger and heightened emotions in confrontations.,I recently stopped taking Vyvanse after feeling seriously burnt out_ where I felt oddly unable to function despite being on the medication_ and spent 5 years without it.  I turned more to marijuana which alleviated the majority of my focus issues_ but caused other problems with memory and thought organization.  I became reliant on MJ and recently turned to Ritalin/methylphenidate again since my productivity had dropped to a lifetime low_ and my preference for MJ is completely gone.  I think I needed a break after being on methylphenidate and later Vyvanse for so long.  As an adult_ I started relying more on MJ to 'come down' from some of the intensity of Vyvanse (and job/life stress) but it (substance use) all has a way of compounding problems.  Nevertheless_ I have been going back and forth between this and MJ over the years to help me focus on my information technology studies and workload.  I think there is not enough information about the similarities between these two substances and their effects on people like myself_ but for me there is no question they both provide a relief in the same area of mental function.  Of course_ no one seems to relate or understand this absolute fact in my mind_ but it's so significant for me that I decided to leave this review here.  I get such a huge benefit from this drug at age 34_ though I was first prescribed in 2nd grade and only stopped for a few years as an adult before I decided it would help me at work.

I used to eat a lot_ my appetite went from hungry to keep myself well to never hungry at all. I also felt thirsty all the time even if my mouth wasn't dry. I was also diagnosed with major depression disorder before getting branded with ADD. I would feel apathetic due to depression but ritalin worsened it_ I never wanted to partake in anything even though it helped me in school. I felt somewhat of a zombie. There was once that I felt like I had overdosed but I took my regular dosage; my head was heavy_ I was slow_ and I felt as if everything was a dream but after a long while it wore out.

Every few years my doc would up my dose until I was maxed out at the highest dose for my weight so she coudn't up it anymore and it was ineffective after 5 years. While on it_ I lost so much weight I was borderline anorexic_ I was already tiny only 4' 8"" while other kids where 4' 11"" or over 5' because it severely stunted my growth and I only weighed 78 lbs. at age 14. I couldn't sleep at all but my parents insisted I keep taking it because if I didn't my grades suffered and I was in trouble at school all the time. I developed uncontrolable tourettes-like motor tics_ like the need to make cat purring noises_ shaking my head to the side abruptly_ clicking my tongue_ or breathing in odd rhythmic patterns. It made me OCD to an extreme_ Also developed a sudden fear of people was afraid everyone was around me was laughing at me_ staring at me_ judging me. I was normally an extreme people person with no fear of public speaking or singing but I was afraid to even swallow in class_ thought everyone could hear it very loudly.

14, 1, Hyperactive/adhd,Anxiety_ Nervousness_ Feeling out of body; detached_ apathetic_ violent_ defiant_ suicidal_,I am 41 years old.  My parents put me on this medication when I was 2 years old.  They claimed it helped manage me.  I claim it messed me up so badly that in my pre-high school years_ my parents took me to specialists all over North America to find out what was wrong with me.  The doctors kept upping my dosage.  I told them I didnt like what the medication made me feel like_ but parents back then didnt listen to their kids.  At 16 I quit cold turkey (because my parents kicked me out of the house due to the side effects of this drug).  I experienced intense emotional distress_ like paranoia_ anxiety_ nervousness_ etc.  Today_ I have gotten much better at managing my emotional issues (WITHOUT DRUGS MIND YOU).  But I still feel those emotions rather intensely.  DO NOT GIVE THIS DRUG TO YOUR CHILDREN.  PLEASE DONT.  If only my parents were more understanding and worked with me rather than shoving pills in my face_ I believe I would have grown up without any of the familial drama that led to me being a street kid.  I believe that constant attention to the child in positive_ understanding environments is THE BEST THING for a child.

30, 1, Mild ADHD,"I was misdiagnosed with mild ADHD back in 1997 simply because I was very antsy and couldn't sit still. I was on this for less than 48 hours due to my ""very unusual and frightening reaction"" as my mother has described it to me.She told me that within 12 hours of me taking my first pill I completely flipped out! I was calmly watching tv when I suddenly started screaming! I threw the remote at the tv_ then threw myself on the floor and had a psychotic episode! I was taken off immediately! The next day at school I remember all of my teachers asking me if I was ""alright"" because I would not stop blinking (ticking) whenever I would speak. *+*I feel as if this is important to note for anyone reading this; around this time I also developed Tourettes Syndrome_ a life long condition that causes a symptom called ""tics"" which are uncontrolable short and repetitive movements/sounds that interfere with motor skills and speech. Tourettes makes the sufferer highly sensitive to their enviournment and to certain foods_ which makes tics worse. I have reason to believe that Ritalin caused this seeing as how I ticked while taking this and have never ticked prior.

I would really call this drug calming effects and muscle movement but not anything to do with learning to put a child it a zombie like state dosen't help with learning.

While I was waiting to get my Ritalin_ my housemate offered me to try some Adderall IR 10mg. I tried that and ultimately thought it was better than Ritalin with its slight euphoria and less jitters/heartburn. Adderall turned out horribly in long-term_ and my psych wanted me on XR_ which was even worse than IR (I did XR 30days_ then IR 30days). Then psych put me on Concerta when I asked to go back on Ritalin. Fail. I asked to go back on Ritalin again_ and my psych starts telling me that if XRs don't work for me_ I must not have ADD after all (she's the one who diagnosed me!!!)_ so she put me on Wellbutrin for depression instead (I told her I wasn't depressed!).

It has done wonders for my focus_ motivation_ and general ability to get things done.  I think that if this medication is used as prescribed (I take it everyday_ HOWEVER_ if I am not working or otherwise doing something that involves a lot of concentration and/or focus I will take *medication holidays*) it will work beautifully.  It should ONLY be prescribed to those of us who REALLY need it.  It has improved my quality of life tremendously and I finally_ for the most part_ feel *normal.*  I was on Adderall for two years prior and I feel Ritalin (IMO) is better overall.

43, 3, Major Depression,Fast heartbeat_ tolerance_ crash after it wears off,I read so much about how stimulants like Ritalin could help with anhedonic symptoms of depression (apathy_ emotional numbness_ lack of drive_ inability to feel pleasure_ etc.) because of their action with catecholamines (dopamine_ norepinepherine_ epinepherine). Well_ as it turned out_ it has been the ONLY med that has had a noticeable effect on my depression out of wellbutrin_ effexor_ abilify_ and desipramine. At first_ as I was titrating up I felt absolutely no different. Once I hit 15mg 2x daily I started feeling a small effect. When I hit 20-30mg_ I hit the peak of what the drug had to offer_ because it started forming a tolerance_ and soon_ the only effect I felt from the Ritalin was an increased heart rate. When it was working I started notice it working 20 minutes after intake_ and then the effect would increase for an hour_ peak for 20 minutes_ then decrease for an hour_ culminating in a crash. I was so disappointed and desperate that I increased the dose again and again on my own still without the initial effects that it had on my mood. I reached 65mg in one dose and my heartbeat hit 190bpm and I had to go to the ER because I was losing consciousness and feeling numb at my extremities. Still_ it has been the most effective treatment yet_ and maybe if nothing else works I will return to it taking it only once or twice a week. It would give me something to look forward to at least in this blank empty apathetic anhedonic zombielike state.,M,20,3  weeks30mg 2X D,9/16/2012,Ritalin

When I take it_ I get into a machine-like state of mind that I can do things with extreme efficiency. It helps into study_ work and even social meetings or internet trollings. It also can help one to stay awake in the night.It also sometimes left myself a little cold and harsh. It's only important to see that it's not a cure. It's a stimulant that give you a rush. It's necessary to take it only when needed. Not only the abuse potential is high_ but also de tolerance and addiction also.

Over the course of the last two years my doctor has let me adjust dosage to see what works best. I am currently at 20 mg every 3 hours with an optional 10 mg as needed. I stay within 100 mg daily but i can flex it out. this seems to avoid the hyperfocus and the up/down as it wears off and waiting for it to kick in again. At first I felt crazy for taking it so often but long acting does not work. It has changed my life. I don't think there is a max dose. It depends on the person and their general health. I would rather take what I need to enjoy life rather than just exist even if they determine it will shorten it. Talk with your doctor. Keep a journal. Adjust it in small doses and see what happens.

Also_ I was on the generic and it seemed to not last more than a few hours and when I crashed_ I would eat a lot.  It did give me a good morning boost of energy and woke me up.  My dr. will keep giving it to me indefinetly_ however_ I've consulted other drs. and all of them recommended I stop taking it.  I switched to Adderall to see if that would be better and I no longer have the glassy-eyed feeling but it also causes the appetite rebound.

I suffered severe headaches as a child. puberty came late_ andwas less than 100 lbs at age17_ and reached 5 foot 10 at age 23. and 120 lbs. today _ i suffer from depression_ and anxiety. ritalin is a serious drug and should not be given to children.,M,36,9  years30 1X D,7/30/2010Email,Ritalin
89, 4, ADD,Loss of appetite (even now)_ dry mouth (no more)_ occasionnal headaches and occasionnal dizziness (even now) (sorry 4 my mistakes),This medicine is no miracle_ and no killer addictive drug if your using it correctly and for the right problem (add_ adhd_ narcolepsy_ bipolarity_ etc). Personnally i noticed a LOT of improvement. I had HUGE anxiety disorders (panic attacks and constant fear and pain in my chest)_ and 95% of the time i was in a clearly depressive mood. Everything in my life was affected by this trouble (school exams_ performances_ relationships_ everyday things to do and thoughts). Since i take this medication.. i have time notion_ i am no more (or max 10 min) late_ i can think before i react to different situations and i feel no more anxiety (just normal stress_ i am free!!!). I am just.. normal!!! No more in a spiral_ i can control my life because i can control myself and my thoughts. I would say the only thing that makes me euphoric these days is that i never felt so released of all my life_ i have no anxiety and this was a very heavy weight on my shoulders. I can think about my future positively and i finally ''forgot'' my past. I'm no more caught in present_ i can enjoy life..Dont forget this medication is just a helper_ this will not change your life dramatically; i personnally still have work to do to have peace of mind_ and i hope someday i will get rid of the medication and be able to live on my own.,F,22,8  days10mg SR 1X D,7/21/2010,Ritalin

92, 3, ADULT ADD,Dry mouth_ dry eyes_ headaches_ confusion_ insomnia and I think I'm already addicted..,Last week my Dr. prescribed me Ritalin to help me better focus_ finish tasks and get my other ADD symptoms under control. I was supposed to take 20mg in the morning and an other 20 at noon as initial dosis to experiment with. After the very first pill the results were so amazing and I could notice a lot of emprovements in my performance_ behavior and feelings.  I ended up taking 7 pills on the first day!! I even started grinding them and snorting them lately to get the maximum effect out of them. I know I didn't follow my Dr's instructions and abused the medication that supposed to make my life better. I feel I'm loosing control about myself when it comes to Ritalin and I just want more and more of it. Tonight I couldn't sleep again the whole night_ and I had time enough to think about this. I've quit smoking 2 months ago and I'm afraid I'm prone to substance abuse now. I also want to stop taking it for a few days and then give it a new try again later. I don't want to tell my dr. about it because I'm afraid he will take me off the stimulants as they do help me.

I feel like I think straight and that the signal-noise ratio has been decreased greatly enough so that I am not bogged down by racing thoughts_ etc. Believe me_ I am someone who hates taking meds_ but I am happy this is helping me. I would gladly take this over the years I have spent feeling confused_ unable to cope_ stressed out over little things like doing dishes_ and anxious as hell. I feel calmer_ more positive_ and able to think straight and I am finally making small dents in things that have been overwhelming me for the last two years. In this case_ I do think a med can be a life-saver. I have heard less bad things about Ritalin and long term use than I have other meds or have felt that they would be bad for me long term.

HOWEVER_ after spending my ENTIRE life spinning my wheels and never getting anywhere_ I could care less if I become addicted to 20 or 40 mg of Ritalin a day.  I don't say that haughtily or arrogantly.  I am just saying that_ after all these years of struggling to focus and finish anything_ I am simply not going to worry about becoming addicted.  I would rather take it for the rest of my life than live with the chaotic mind and life I have without it.  It has changed my life.

It finally got better after about a week_ but still_ the first half hour after taking it was always very uncomfortable.

It must be hard for them to understand why they feel so bad. HOWEVER_ the medication is VERY efficient. It totally changed my life. I strongly suggest you to take_ or give your child CONCERTA instead of ritalin. It is exactly the same molecule (methylphenidate). The difference is the caplet. The CONCERTA caplet is NOT digested by the organism. It is in fact a water-permeable plastic capsule with a tiny laser drilled hole_ recovered by a digestible layer. When you take the pill_ the first layer disappears_ opening the tiny hole_ and uncovering the water-permeable capsule. This capsule contains three things : 2 drugs compartments with Methylphenidate inside_ and a tiny compressed sponge. As the water present in your organism slowly goes throughout the capsule_ the sponge gets bigger and pushes the medication outside the capsule in a 12 hours lap. 22% of the medication is released immediately when you take the pill_ the rest is slowly released. Notice that 10% of the med stays inside the capsule_ so this is why CONCERTA dosages are always higher than your usual daily Ritalin dosage.

However_ the past couple of days my stomach has begun hurting really bad whenever I take it. I'm not sure if it is the Ritalin or not_ or if it is possible for a symptom I didn't have before to appear. It's not nausea or gas pains. More like a burning. It's just getting worse_ though.

In order to combat both ADHD and narcolepsy_ I am prescribed very high doses of these drugs.  When switching from 120mg/day of Adderall to 120mg/day of Ritalin_ I was astonished by how different the two drugs were.  Even though both drugs are part of the amphetamine family_ their effects are quite different.  I experience no irritability_ excitability or sleepiness on Adderall_ but I can barely function on Ritalin.  Even though patients who TRULY have ADHD/ADD are not supposed to be ""hyped-up"" or have increased energy while taking these types of drugs_ I was amazed by how much Ritalin actually leaned towards the polar opposite end of the spectrum.

Was on Prozac but I was a zommbie and I wanted to be outside looking at the starts (very stoned feeling - calm - not motivated).  In one day a total turn around in myself as it relates to self_ work_ and home.  More calm with husband and child.  Once I take a pill goose pimps run all over my body - in a good way.  I can see why people can be addicted to it.,F,34,1  months,4/4/2005,Ritalin

182, 4, Adult ADD,,I started on Ritalin about 5 weeks ago and I have been taking the time release form of ritalin (40mg over about 9-11 hours) for about 3 weeks now because I could never remember to dose 3 times a day.  Overall the function of the drug has been great and the side effects have been nill_ the problem has come when the time release wears off and I take a 10mg tablet of the regular form for a focus boost if I need one to get me through the rest of the evening.

184, 1, narcolepsy,I took my first dose of Ritalin last Tuesday morning.  Within15 minutes I was a Zombi.  It wasn't a feeling of dizziness.... I was totally stoned !!  Couldn't think or move for almost 2 hours at which time these horrible effects began to subside.,I can't describe how disappointed I was with my reaction to Ritalin.  I was so looking forward to being able to stay awake and actually being able to concentrate and focus. My Doctor then changed my prescription to Provigil. Although I wasn't as bad_ it still had a sedative effect on me.  My Psychiatrist said she has never heard of anyone having this effect on Ritalin. I wish somewould could explain it to me.,F,55,1  days,11/14/2004Email,Ritalin
185, 2, Decreased cognitive function,Heart palpitations_ urinary incontinence after going the bathroom_ nervousness_ paranoia and an increased need to masturbate. < Hope that last side effect isn't to vulger sounding to read_ but it is a side effect.,I was prescribed ritalin to increase my cognitive function when I was being presribed Zyprexa to treat my anxiety. And well I used to abuse only ritalin itself when I was a teenager just because it got me high_ but ritalin alone just makes me feel nevous now so i don't use it. anyway_ I'm no longer in nead of ritalin now because I'm no longer being prescribed antipsychotic meds for my anxiety. so I don't need it to stimulate my cognition. I'v been on ritalin for up to eight years counting the times for which I wasn't prescribed it. I'm now being presribed 20mg.s of diazepam (valium) to take three times a day and its working well to treat my anxiety.,M,23,8  years,11/5/2004Email,Ritalin
