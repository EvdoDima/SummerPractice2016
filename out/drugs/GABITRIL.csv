1, 4, waking out of stage 3 and 4 sleep,If I stay up too late or go a night without sleeping my sense of reality and mental stability becomes unsteady. My pms is worst as too much GABA is seen to be a factor in premenstrual symptoms. My limbs are more restless in sleep and I feel like I could honestly just sleep for days if I wanted to when I'm sleeping.,Since going on this medication its completely solved the physical and mental pain due to years of sleep deprevation. I feel like myself finally. This medication is incredible for me as it makes me able to have restorative sleep every night.,F,29,3  years6mg,1/14/2015,Gabitril

4, 4, Anxiety,,I just wanted to counter some of the reviews here. Gabitril is believed to be a GABA reuptake inhibitor_ which ultimately means that it leaves more GABA in the synapses for neurotransmission. This is significant because GABA is the brain's central inhibitory neurotransmitter. So put most simply_ Gabitril tells your brain: shut up! At the doses I am taking_ I get none of the crazy side-effects mentioned in many of the posts. So far (which admittedly is not a long time) Gabitril has been fantastic for my anxiety_ allowing me to take fewer benzos_ which is my aim. So the moral is: everyone's body is different; a medicine that puts someone through hell could be someone else's panacea.,M,36,3  days12-24 mg 2X D,8/4/2013,Gabitril

6, 1, Chronic Headache,I got this drug because I have a f**ked up tension headache which has ruined my life and I have tried everything.  The only thing that works is Desipramine in small doses.  Anyway_ this drug made me stupid and disoriented for about a week_ but it did seem to cut the sensation of pain in my head.  I upped 8mgs a week for 3 weeks and my headache waned_ BUT one day I took an extra 8mg accidentally AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE so I went to the ER.  I can't explain it ... I thought I was going to lose consciousness and cease to exist.  Needless to say this scared the crap out of me.  I would rather be addicted to vicodin than have any more bad experiences like that.,I think I am cursed with a chronic headache and I hope one day they make a medication which gets rid of it_ but Gabitril isn't it.  Its a very very powerful drug that causes severe mental retardation and is very difficult to dose up.   I will say that it did cut the pain in my head and maybe if I could afford to stay in a hospital while dosing up I would try to make it work.  But who wants to feel like they are going to go out of their mind and die? Not me.,M,46,4  weeks28 2X D,4/27/2012Email,Gabitril
7, 1, Taking for anxiety,My experience with this drug seems to sound like a broken record from all the posts I read here.This med is absolute poison and the Bozo the Clown Dr.and his Carmel Psychological Associate Group_ located in Westchester County_ NY should be sued and shut down for prescribing it_ amongst other things. Just like many posts_ right out of the blue I became like a zombie_like a switchwas thrown in my head_ confused_ babled when I talked making no sense and doing weird things. Rushed to ER who thought I was having a stroke or bleeding on the brain. I was terrified I was going to die and cried like a baby in the hospital and they had no clue on how to treat this_ so they just kept me until it wore off about 12 hours later and aftersuffering from a spinal tap with no anesthesia_ which they performed. I can not insist enough how BAD! this drug_ Gabitril is. I give it a 1. I wish I could give it a -5.,,M,42,2  weeks6 3X D,1/27/2011,Gabitril
8, 4, headache,I have had a disabling tension headache for 20 years.  I have tried everything and this is the only medication besides Pamelor that helps dramatically!   Its really unpredicable and can have some major side effects (like sedation/intoxication/psychosis) but it does help with my headache noticiably and nothing else does.,Very strange medication because a small dose acts so strongly and if you go up to fast you can get hospitalizing side-effects_ but it does have some use for pain and headaches.,M,40,60  days24 2X D,5/1/2010,Gabitril

I could tell a difference with the first_ tiny dose. It is very important to take this drug with food and just before sleep as it is sedating and causes general loopiness_ especially in the first few months.

With Gabitril_ I wake up & feel great because my body is getting what it needs...real sleep!  Oh & for all of you who complain about abnormal dreams: Yes_ I have wierd dreams with Gabitril_ but it is because I am SLEEPING!  I finally hit my REM sleep.

I do notice a decreased ability to concentrate but hey_ it is difficult to concentrate in pain as well!,I noticed if I take it consistently for at least two weeks it can decrease my pain significantly.  Combined with my pain meds_ I can actually spend a day without focusing on my pain.  it has also helped with my depression and anxiety.  Things seem brighter.

Good combination with seroquel. Does improve mood. Not a panacea though.,M,32,2  years,6/28/2004,Gabitril

I had strange dreams_ and waking dreams.The effects never wore off during day. I felt lethargic and drugged all day. I could not get things done. I felt depressed and irritable.,I have a high tolerance when it comes to medications. I usually need more of a med than the average person before it does anything...even so_ was not on high dose of Gabitril. Perhaps it was something in my own chemistry that did not agree with the med.
