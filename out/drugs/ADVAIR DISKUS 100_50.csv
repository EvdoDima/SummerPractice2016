3, 3, Asthma,I was twelve when I first started taking advair 250/50. It was while taking advair that my hair started to fall out. During that time mother and I didnt know the reason why. I only found out why 9 years later when I couldn't afford the medicine for three months and my hair started growing back. Unfortinately that was too long without it and I ended up being hospitalized. I was able to get a free advair from the hospital and immediately after I took the first dose my hair started to fall out in chuncks. Another side effect of advair was that if I missed one dose I would immediately develop a cold. And since I was forgetful that was a normal occurance for me. And if I missed a full day I suffered severe asthma symptoms within 8 hours (think school days) of the missed dose and would need to be rushed to hospital for treatment. If I had albuterol I could extend the time it takes before I have to be rushed to the hospital_ but even then it's pure torture surviving like that. For the albuterol does not help for long (minutes) and it doesn't help with all of the symptoms.One last thing I noticed was that even though it was helpful during the day. It was very unhelpful in terms of dealing with my exercise induced asthma. Any type of running for a minute was impossible because immediately my asthma would act up. Wheezing_ chest tightness_ heart pounding_ and a pain deep in the lungs everytime I tried to draw breath. It got to the point where any exercise more strenuous than a walk was,While on advair it did make my life a little easier to handle with my asthma being partially under control. But I didnt like the fact that it seemed like my body was dependent on it. For this last year I was finally able to stop taking it completely. It took effort and was gradual from taking one dose a day instead of two_ to just taking it when my asthma would start to flair up. And after a while the flair ups became less and less until I didn't need to take it anymore. As a matter of fact I was able to survive cold turkey from any asthma medications except for albuetoral for 6 months. Then I made the mistake of getting a cat_ but now that I know it's possible to survive without advair_ I would prefer to live without it then with.,F,23,10  years250/50,3/1/2016Email,Advair diskus 100/50

Both side-effects disappeared after three weeks.After first month:Muscle pain_ back pain_ leg cramps.

Muscle pain disappeared after two months.After 6 months:Gradual weight loss: Down 25 pound in 6 months.  Doctor says this is not caused directly by the drug_ but due a low-carb diet and increase in physical exercise enabled by the drug.Improved sense of smell to both good and bad odours.Sometimes experience cramps in chest or feeling ""not normal"".

6, 1, Asthma,Severe anxiety and depressionNight terrorsHair thinning/lossExtreme fatigue Infertility These are symptoms that all began after i started taking Advair 250/50 and persist today. ,5 years ago I attempted to stop taking the advair and failed miserably. After several miserable weeks (during which i thought i was dying) I started taking the lower dose Advair 100/50.0 It took me at least 3 years to start to feel normal again. At first i needed prednizone and albueral daily to get by. Eventually things got better and I rarely use my inhaler- although i am still taking Avair 100/50. I have attempted to dose down several times in the last 2 years and have been unable to get off of this medication. I am unable to hold a job due to the depression_ anxiety and fatigue. The price of this medication is obscene.When it was first prescribed to me I had insurance and didn't know how much it cost- Since then i have lost my insurance and now must pay $300/ month for the rest of my life. I got insurance a few years ago and they refused to pay for it because it was a pre existing condition. YAYI have been to multiple doctors and have had many tests done and they have found no reason or explanation for  my symptoms. I personally know that these symptoms began shortly after starting this drug and I believe it to be the cause.,F,28,7  years100/50 1X D,5/11/2015Email,Advair diskus 100/50
7, 1, Severe asthma,thrush_ weight gain_ anxiety_ abdominal pain_ headaches_ intestinal issues,For years I've been trying to figure out what was wrong with me_ but now I believe that this drug and being on it for so long has caused most of these issues. Even eating very severely low calorie diets_ trying anything I could to get rid of weight_ it just kept steadily rising the entire time I was on the drug. (I stopped in 2014 due to lack of insurance.) No diet or lifestyle change yielded any weight loss; drs very confused. Thrush was constant the last year I was on it and no drug would touch it to get rid of it. It stopped about 3 months after going off the drug. Headaches were severely worse while on it and have tapered off to normal headaches people get not soul-crushing experiences. Now that I'm off it_ my abdomen feels cramped up all the time; drs think it's left overs from years of having something regulating the tightness as it lessens with the use of an emergency inhaler. Asthma is actually the same now that I'm off of it as it was on it. Still there_ no better or worse.,F,32,12  years250/50 2x 2X D,5/8/2015Email,Advair diskus 100/50

My doctor then switched me to a stronger dose of Advair Diskus and my breathing got even worse.  I felt like the Advair was killing me.  I then quit using Advair and switched to expectorant.

9, 1, ASTHMA AND PERMANENT LUNG DAMAGE,Heart palpitations; weight gain; difficulty swallowing; mouth swellings even though I'm dilligent about scrubbing my mouth clean after each use; difficulty sleeping; joint pains; continually tired.,Initially_ I was given Advair Diskus from a PA who thought that I had asthmatic pneumonia. Then I had a lifethreatening bout of Eociniphylic Pneumonitis and was put on oral steroids and other inhalers. After a few years; dr put me back on Advair. I've complained of weight gain; heart palpitations; joint pain; tiredness; difficulty swallowing; mouth swellings; difficulty sleeping; and more. I'm continually offered additional medications to assist with my symptoms. I slowly weaned myself to one dose a day. Then; due to insurance issues I've been without any Advair for 3 days. I have sever difficulty swallowing; my chest pains me; and I'm a little scared of how I feel. I'm so hoping that I can get back to National Jewish Health and get the proper health assistance that they had given to me almost 7 years ago.,F,52,3  years100/50 2X D,4/10/2015,Advair diskus 100/50

Know myself better than my doctor knew if this was going to help my airway 1x a day would help. I finished the sample and Noted my prescription was 250/50 I thought  WTH?? so I took it every other day for a day or so_ the side effects were immediate very sore throat_ dry cough_ correcting my throat eye soreness_ very tired_ and the worst a fluttering feeling in chest area. I did tell her about the fluttering and she steamed right over it.... Well in any case I knew I NEEDED TO STOP IT_ the first 2 days I went without it I knew my decision was a good one for me I felt better and I can breathe better and have a cough and slight soreness in throat and the weird feeling in chest comes once in a while_ however for me I knew from the beginning this was not something to start FULL steam at 2 dosages because it would become a safety net and a habit. Please check on medicine before taking it LA,This is from my own personal experience if you do not have asmha don't wait til its too late and you end up with it from this medication_ doctors are HUMAN too and often prescribe medication that not all of us can tolerate a GREAT doctor asks Questions and  Listens to what you tell them and remembers it.

16, 1, Asthma,It did help to control my asthma attacks_ which was good.  The bad part was that I experienced extreme hoarseness_ to the point where I could hardly utter any words despite being vigilant about rinsing out my mouth after every dosage.   Additionally_ I was getting red rashes all over my upper torso_ especially on my arms and I also experienced some severe foot cramps a couple of times.  I quit taking Advair without telling my doctor and all of these symptoms cleared-up after about a week.  It is my firm belief that this medication is dangerous_ poses long-term health risks and should be pulled from the market.  Having had asthma for most of my life I'd rather just depend on my rescue inhaler everyday instead of using any type of drug such as Advair.  I fear that using Advair on a regular basis  can cause you to become more and more dependent on Advair an over time will destroy your lung function to the point where even daily doses of the strongest prescription of Advair will be ineffective.  Not to mention the fact that the stuff is un-godly expensive.  Use extreme caution.,,M,45,5  months,4/1/2014,Advair diskus 100/50

Albuterol wasn't working alone_ and after several dozen trips to the ER_ I was prescribed Advair and Singular. A few weeks after starting these_ I contracted a bronchial virus. Antibiotics did nothing to help. After the first 2 months_ it had gotten so bad I ended up in the ER again. Chest X-rays showed my lungs were literally covered in spots of bacteria. I was diagnosed with pneumonia. Since then_ I have tried almost every antibiotic available that doesn't make me vomit horribly_ but nothing has helped. Several doctors have told me there is nothing more I can do_ the bacteria is too persistant because I went so long without treatment. The pneumonia eventually went away on its own_ but nearly took my life_ and left me with chronic bronchitis.  It wasn't until just recently that I discovered both drugs contain Salmeterol. The company that created Salmeterol ADMITS that it ""may cause viral infection and asthma related DEATH."" They use the actual word 'death.' In fact_ you will hear that exact statement listed in side effects. A medicine that has the ability to KILL YOU from taking normally_ should not be on the market.

Her lungs would just not shut down. Singulair worked BUT it had side effects we didn't like. As she got older the doctor switched her to Advair. We only needed a puff or two to do the trick and then we were done. Well_ recently_ for some reason she has needed to take it every day for a month. She just couldn't get over her cold/cough. She got over the cold_ cough continued_ thus more Advair (with Albuterol inhaler). We saw our 8 year old daughter turn into an emotional wreck. She didn't want to participate in activities. Basically just wanted to sit on the couch and watch TV. When Daddy went to work_ she just about fell apart emotionally saying she would miss him_ and she would hug him and not let go. Overly dramatic and emotional. She loves her Daddy but this was as if he was going off to War and never to be seen again types of emotion. Just the slightest thing would set her off emotionally both sad types of emotions and angry types of emotions. I am on day 3 of taking Advair away. Yes_ still dry coughs_ but her NORMAL self is returning slowly. Her appetite is decreasing.   YES_ ADVAIR does work_ but the side effects in our opinion are not worth it if you have to use it long term (every day).  We are trying to teach her some relaxation techniques to help with the cough.

Mild sore throat; slight spacey feeling.","I don't have bad asthma; just comes on when I have a cold or sometimes with exercise. I just started taking Advair last week.  My tongue feels like it is burning - and it feels like it *has been burned*. It's like I took a sip of very hot coffee. My taste buds are diminished; and I have a slightly sore throat. But the tongue thing is a very strange feeling. I saw where others have reported swollen tongue; I am not having that. Also_ I feel a little ""Spacey"". Additionally I should note that these effects not kick in for about 1 hour after using Advair - and last for at least 12 hours. I have also noted a pasty film on my tongue that is not normally there. Additionally_ my breath is ""strange"" (bad_ but not horrible) for hours after taking it. And yes_ I have rinsed my mouth ""severely"" each time. Doesn't seem to make a difference.

Ranting raving_ raging against me. *if i asked why he was so aggressive_ he'd just get more angry! *Cussed_ demoralized me_ tore me down piece-by-piece as a person.*if words & attitude could kill_ I'd be dead many times.*He had such derision & contempt in his voice_ like pure hate_verging on totally losing control.*Our relationship was frequently volatile_ but NOTHING like THIS!* 2ce in the last 2 weeks_ we'd made plans for him to visit the next day.*When he didn't show_ I called & he was watching tv &/or sleeping but again_ ranted & rave,F,,5  days,8/2/2007Email,Advair diskus 100/50

I can now sleep through the night without waking up unable to breath_ and that has been such a relief.At the same time_ I often wonder at what price this 'wonder drug' comes.  It is an inhaled steroid_ which can cause problems in the system over time.  Plus_ if I skip a dose_ my asthma acts up right away - sometimes worse than it ever was prior to my starting on advair.  And I am starting to have problems with my teeth - my gumline is receding and gums bleed a lot during brushing and dental cleanings.
