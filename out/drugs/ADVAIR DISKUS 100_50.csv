3, 3, Asthma,I was twelve when I first started taking advair 250/50. It was while taking advair that my hair started to fall out. During that time mother and I didnt know the reason why. I only found out why 9 years later when I couldn't afford the medicine for three months and my hair started growing back. Unfortinately that was too long without it and I ended up being hospitalized. I was able to get a free advair from the hospital and immediately after I took the first dose my hair started to fall out in chuncks. Another side effect of advair was that if I missed one dose I would immediately develop a cold. And since I was forgetful that was a normal occurance for me. And if I missed a full day I suffered severe asthma symptoms within 8 hours (think school days) of the missed dose and would need to be rushed to hospital for treatment. If I had albuterol I could extend the time it takes before I have to be rushed to the hospital_ but even then it's pure torture surviving like that. For the albuterol does not help for long (minutes) and it doesn't help with all of the symptoms.One last thing I noticed was that even though it was helpful during the day. It was very unhelpful in terms of dealing with my exercise induced asthma. Any type of running for a minute was impossible because immediately my asthma would act up. Wheezing_ chest tightness_ heart pounding_ and a pain deep in the lungs everytime I tried to draw breath. It got to the point where any exercise more strenuous than a walk was,While on advair it did make my life a little easier to handle with my asthma being partially under control. But I didnt like the fact that it seemed like my body was dependent on it. For this last year I was finally able to stop taking it completely. It took effort and was gradual from taking one dose a day instead of two_ to just taking it when my asthma would start to flair up. And after a while the flair ups became less and less until I didn't need to take it anymore. As a matter of fact I was able to survive cold turkey from any asthma medications except for albuetoral for 6 months. Then I made the mistake of getting a cat_ but now that I know it's possible to survive without advair_ I would prefer to live without it then with.,F,23,10  years250/50,3/1/2016Email,Advair diskus 100/50

Both side-effects disappeared after three weeks.After first month:Muscle pain_ back pain_ leg cramps.

Muscle pain disappeared after two months.After 6 months:Gradual weight loss: Down 25 pound in 6 months.  Doctor says this is not caused directly by the drug_ but due a low-carb diet and increase in physical exercise enabled by the drug.Improved sense of smell to both good and bad odours.Sometimes experience cramps in chest or feeling ""not normal"".

6, 1, Asthma,Severe anxiety and depressionNight terrorsHair thinning/lossExtreme fatigue Infertility These are symptoms that all began after i started taking Advair 250/50 and persist today. ,5 years ago I attempted to stop taking the advair and failed miserably. After several miserable weeks (during which i thought i was dying) I started taking the lower dose Advair 100/50.0 It took me at least 3 years to start to feel normal again. At first i needed prednizone and albueral daily to get by. Eventually things got better and I rarely use my inhaler- although i am still taking Avair 100/50. I have attempted to dose down several times in the last 2 years and have been unable to get off of this medication. I am unable to hold a job due to the depression_ anxiety and fatigue. The price of this medication is obscene.When it was first prescribed to me I had insurance and didn't know how much it cost- Since then i have lost my insurance and now must pay $300/ month for the rest of my life. I got insurance a few years ago and they refused to pay for it because it was a pre existing condition. YAYI have been to multiple doctors and have had many tests done and they have found no reason or explanation for  my symptoms. I personally know that these symptoms began shortly after starting this drug and I believe it to be the cause.,F,28,7  years100/50 1X D,5/11/2015Email,Advair diskus 100/50
7, 1, Severe asthma,thrush_ weight gain_ anxiety_ abdominal pain_ headaches_ intestinal issues,For years I've been trying to figure out what was wrong with me_ but now I believe that this drug and being on it for so long has caused most of these issues. Even eating very severely low calorie diets_ trying anything I could to get rid of weight_ it just kept steadily rising the entire time I was on the drug. (I stopped in 2014 due to lack of insurance.) No diet or lifestyle change yielded any weight loss; drs very confused. Thrush was constant the last year I was on it and no drug would touch it to get rid of it. It stopped about 3 months after going off the drug. Headaches were severely worse while on it and have tapered off to normal headaches people get not soul-crushing experiences. Now that I'm off it_ my abdomen feels cramped up all the time; drs think it's left overs from years of having something regulating the tightness as it lessens with the use of an emergency inhaler. Asthma is actually the same now that I'm off of it as it was on it. Still there_ no better or worse.,F,32,12  years250/50 2x 2X D,5/8/2015Email,Advair diskus 100/50

My doctor then switched me to a stronger dose of Advair Diskus and my breathing got even worse.  I felt like the Advair was killing me.  I then quit using Advair and switched to expectorant.

9, 1, ASTHMA AND PERMANENT LUNG DAMAGE,Heart palpitations; weight gain; difficulty swallowing; mouth swellings even though I'm dilligent about scrubbing my mouth clean after each use; difficulty sleeping; joint pains; continually tired.,Initially_ I was given Advair Diskus from a PA who thought that I had asthmatic pneumonia. Then I had a lifethreatening bout of Eociniphylic Pneumonitis and was put on oral steroids and other inhalers. After a few years; dr put me back on Advair. I've complained of weight gain; heart palpitations; joint pain; tiredness; difficulty swallowing; mouth swellings; difficulty sleeping; and more. I'm continually offered additional medications to assist with my symptoms. I slowly weaned myself to one dose a day. Then; due to insurance issues I've been without any Advair for 3 days. I have sever difficulty swallowing; my chest pains me; and I'm a little scared of how I feel. I'm so hoping that I can get back to National Jewish Health and get the proper health assistance that they had given to me almost 7 years ago.,F,52,3  years100/50 2X D,4/10/2015,Advair diskus 100/50

Know myself better than my doctor knew if this was going to help my airway 1x a day would help. I finished the sample and Noted my prescription was 250/50 I thought  WTH?? so I took it every other day for a day or so_ the side effects were immediate very sore throat_ dry cough_ correcting my throat eye soreness_ very tired_ and the worst a fluttering feeling in chest area. I did tell her about the fluttering and she steamed right over it.... Well in any case I knew I NEEDED TO STOP IT_ the first 2 days I went without it I knew my decision was a good one for me I felt better and I can breathe better and have a cough and slight soreness in throat and the weird feeling in chest comes once in a while_ however for me I knew from the beginning this was not something to start FULL steam at 2 dosages because it would become a safety net and a habit. Please check on medicine before taking it LA,This is from my own personal experience if you do not have asmha don't wait til its too late and you end up with it from this medication_ doctors are HUMAN too and often prescribe medication that not all of us can tolerate a GREAT doctor asks Questions and  Listens to what you tell them and remembers it.

16, 1, Asthma,It did help to control my asthma attacks_ which was good.  The bad part was that I experienced extreme hoarseness_ to the point where I could hardly utter any words despite being vigilant about rinsing out my mouth after every dosage.   Additionally_ I was getting red rashes all over my upper torso_ especially on my arms and I also experienced some severe foot cramps a couple of times.  I quit taking Advair without telling my doctor and all of these symptoms cleared-up after about a week.  It is my firm belief that this medication is dangerous_ poses long-term health risks and should be pulled from the market.  Having had asthma for most of my life I'd rather just depend on my rescue inhaler everyday instead of using any type of drug such as Advair.  I fear that using Advair on a regular basis  can cause you to become more and more dependent on Advair an over time will destroy your lung function to the point where even daily doses of the strongest prescription of Advair will be ineffective.  Not to mention the fact that the stuff is un-godly expensive.  Use extreme caution.,,M,45,5  months,4/1/2014,Advair diskus 100/50

42, 3, asthama / sarcoidosis,,Advair appears to have helped me BUT if the inhaler is out of medicine it still puffs so if I don't put my glasses on and read the tiny numbers of doses left on the back I can and have run out which resuts in ROID RAGE for me and hell for those around me.,M,54, 100 2X D,5/29/2011Email,Advair diskus 100/50
43, 5, Asthma,Weakened enamel. I have had 3 full crowns and an implant since taking this. One day I woke up and literally had a crumbled tooth in my mouth. My dentist says my hygiene is good and the chemicals in inhalers are doing damage. I rinse thoroughly after use now. My teeth have been in good condition for the past two years.,I cannot get a good night sleep without Advair. If I don't take it I wake up wheezing. It's been very helpful for me while living with asthma. I recommended it to my father-in-law and he loves it too.,F,30,7  years250 1X D,4/6/2011,Advair diskus 100/50
44, 5, Asthma,None so far.,My pack is actually 250/50. I was using my rescue inhaler at least 8-10 times per day. The evening I took my first inhalation of Advair it was SUCH a relief! I slept the entire night without using my rescue inhaler! Now I've been on it for over a week and I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to use my rescue inhaler! Advair has been a BLESSING to me!,F,48,10  days1 puff 2X D,4/6/2011Email,Advair diskus 100/50

47, 4, asthma,Mild and occasional foot cramps.,Actually taking 250/50 BID and it helps keep my asthma in better control.

48, 2, Prescribed for lung irritation,"Accelerating symptoms of tightness in chest_ ""racing heart""_ difficulty taking a breath_ sores developing on tongue_ swelling in throat_ difficulty swallowing (had to discontinue taking other medicines as they would not go down)_ diminished strength_ difficulty walking_ unable to leave home.",In two weeks I changed from being able to leave my house to shop briefly_ perform quick errands_ go out to eat and other tasks to being unable to leave my home except for important medical appointments.  I don't know whether my developing problems resulted from inhaling the vitamin (underwent bronchoscopy for removal) or from using Advair but the first week after the medical procedure I was not using Advair and was recovering much better.  I am not being treated for Asthma or COPD problems_ only a lung irritation due to vitamin residue remaining in my lungs!  I would not advise anyone NOT to take this medicine if it truly will help them_  as many people do not experience side effects_ but hope doctors will listen to those who have real difficulty_ since my doctors don't seem to want to listen to me.,F,63,14  days100/50 2X D,12/4/2010,Advair diskus 100/50

No idea then checked the side effects and there it was. Went for accupunture and taking vitamin K to help heal the bruises but old marks still there . Wish there was something else to take . Am worried my asthma will get worse and stuck taking this drug.,F,52,5  years 1X D,11/28/2010Email,Advair diskus 100/50
50, 3, 100/50,Major weight gain and panic attacks.,It has helped me with my asthma_ but now I have to take medication for my panic attacks. I can exercise and eat right_ but not able to lose weight. I am going to try and stop using Advair. I'm on day 3 without it and my asthma has gotten worse. It seems as if my lungs are addicted to this drug.  My panic attacks are so bad I have trouble driving now; I never had a panic attack until I started taking this drug. Never thought about it being linked to Advair_ makes since now!,F,42,8  years 1X D,11/26/2010Email,Advair diskus 100/50
51, 1, nighttime asthma trouble sleeping,Severe anxiety depression. adrenal suppression. worsening asthma symptoms.,I would not suggest anyone take this medication- especially children. I became dependent on it ( addicted) and now have to take prednisone and albuterol everyday. I dont know if i will ever be the same again. My asthma was tolerable before i started advair I could live my life walk around outside _ now i cant leave my house. I need the albuterol constantly. I told my doctor about the side effects and she wants to put me back on the advair. My life is over i am totally dependent on it.,F,23,2  years 1X D,11/7/2010Email,Advair diskus 100/50

54, 5, Asthma,None,I've been taking this discus for over five years now_ and I cannot say just how much it has helped improve the quality of my life. Because of it_ I can breathe like a normal person again and actually play sports without having to use a rescue inhaler. I wish they'd had this stuff when I was a kid. I haven't had any of the severe or even mild side effects that other people have listed here. I do know that I will probably never be able to get off this medicine_ though_ without a suitable replacement drug; I can feel the difference in my breathing when I miss even one dose_ let alone try to go cold turkey.,M,23,5  years 2X D,9/25/2010,Advair diskus 100/50
55, 4, COPD,(Took on and off for 8+ years)Worked great for years...almost DIED 3 times with pneumonia...still took Advair until this past year after warning stating pneumonia risk...which my doctor shrugged off...now I get pneumonia at least once a year. My doctor still prescribes.,I found myself taking a few puffs now and again...(not really knowing if Advair caused my pneumonia)but it scares me to think maybe it did so I finally through it away! I think you should think twice before taking Advair if you've had pneumonia.,F,47,5  years250/50 2X D,9/22/2010,Advair diskus 100/50
56, 1, Asthma,Advair gave me chest pains when using not all the time but occasionally. Once I quit Avdair I have not had these chest pains.Advair costs too much also I found when I switched to an alternative GENERIC. I found that Budesonide inhalation suspension along with a followed albuterol dose works as well or better than Advair did with out the side affects. It was a pain to get it prescribed as the Doctors are on the take with the brand name pharms!,This stuff should be researched further I believe it is unsafe for some users!,M,48,8  months250/50 2X D,8/16/2010,Advair diskus 100/50
57, 5, Severe Asthma,None,Advair has saved my life.  I've had asthma since I was 3.  As an adult I spent weeks in the hospital getting off of 60 mg/day of prednisone and was then sent to National Jewish hospital in Denver.  I was on 13 prescriptions at the time.  They got me turned around and now I use only Advair and on the rare occasion my albuterol inhaler.  I know it can have bad side effects for some_ but for me it literally gave me my life back.,F,55,9  years100/50 2X D,7/9/2010,Advair diskus 100/50
58, 2, COPD,"Extensive Weight gain that even a 1 year less than 1200 calorie diet and a daily three mile walk/run/hike could not stop. Horrible withdrawals when I tried to go off the medicine that I did not recognize as associated with Advair until my daughter said I acted like I had ""roid rage_"" something I had never even heard of--my symptoms included thoughts of suicide_ severe anger and anxiety_ and the list goes on. I talked to my pulmonary doctor who assured me I did not know what I was talking about_ that I did not gain the weight after being on Advair from Advair_ nor did I experience withdrawal problems because the steroids in Advair are not ""those kind"" of steroids. Just because a doctor says it does not mean he/she knows anything about the medicine prescribed.",I thing I now have to be on this for life since I am now too scared to try going off of it. I do not know what I am going to do about my weight. I work out five days a week_ am an a dot.fit program that I track my 1100 calories a day on_ and am with a trainer. Frankly_ I think my metabolism is toast and even though I can breath better_ the rest of my body is failing. Now I wonder_ what's next_ kidneys or liver?,F,48,1.5  years 1X D,6/28/2010,Advair diskus 100/50
59, 5, Asthma,Dry mouth.,This has worked wonders for me. I would go through an albuterol inhaler every month. After starting advair 6 years ago i've used a total of 7 albuterol inhalers. My last expired before I used it. I know a lot of people have had serious problems with this medication but it's helped me achieve a quality of life I didn't have for 22 years. I can exercise and deal with it much easier now_ I don't get short of breath walking up stairs either_ it's wonderful.,M,28,6  years100/50 2X D,6/24/2010,Advair diskus 100/50
