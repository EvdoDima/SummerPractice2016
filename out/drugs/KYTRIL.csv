2, 1, chemo nausea,none,Tried this drug after compazine and zofran had no effect on my nausea. Same story with this one. It did absolutely nothing to help my nausea.,F,37,4  times,8/6/2009,Kytril
3, 5, My 11 year old - Chemo Therapy,none that we know of.,My son doesn't respond to meds that usually help others. He started Temodar last week for his chemo and had alot of vomitting the first night. We gave him Kytril the following 4 nights about an hour before the chemo and he had no vomitting at all. Seems to have worked fine. We had tried Zofran alot previously and it did not help.,M,11,4  days,5/1/2006,Kytril
4, 5, To prevent anesthesia nausea/vomiti,No side-effects.,Kytril was given to me during surgery to prevent the horrible nausea/vomiting I typically suffer from as a result of the surgical anesthesia given.  What a miracle drug this was for me as for the first time in my life_ I was free from the horrendous vomiting that has plagued me after all other past surgeries.  Normally_ I would be sick an average of 3-5 days post-op with such severe nausea/vomiting_ I would became weak and dehydrated.  Kytril prevented all these side-effects and my recovery from surgery was a breeze because I did not have to contend with the vomiting.  Kytril is truly a wonder drug and I give two thumbs up for its effectiveness!!,F,43,1  days,9/5/2005,Kytril
