0, 5, Insomnia,I have no side effects. I wake up around 5am ready to start my day.,I have to take it on an empty stomach or it takes hours to work. I also  take 1mg Lorazepam (also prescribed) and two Benedryl alergy tablets along with it.,F,72,10  years30 MG 1X D,8/11/2016,Restoril
1, 2, Insomnia,I take it 2 hrs before bed. Am lucky to sleep 3 hrs. No hangover effect_ but vivid dreams and severe restlessness.,Was recently diagnosed with lupus (SLE). Wondering if Restoril will eventually help me sleep.,F,65,5  days30mg,7/10/2016,Restoril
2, 5, insomnia,Morning hangover,Well I usually only review drugs when they are terrible_ but this one was actually pretty good. I've been dealing with insomnia for several months now and was prescribed restoril. It put me out quickly and would keep me out for about 7 hours. I would recommend this one. I also tried ambien. It was good too_just a little less sleep but no hangover at all.,M,27,7  days30 mg,4/27/2016,Restoril
3, 3, Insomnia,Vivid dreams_ headaches_ dry mouth_ irritability_ weight gain_ insomnia_ confusion or mental cloudiness_ joint swelling.,Have been on Restoril for a long time_ it's gotten to the point where I'm falling asleep at 2am and waking at 6am.,F,38,4  years30 MG,4/17/2016,Restoril
4, 3, Sleep,Reduce inhibitions_ leading to unacceptable behavior. Felt really tired the next morning if I did not get ten to twelve hours sleep.,After a month my body started getting accustomed to and behavior returned to normal. Now only take on Fridays and Saturdays night when I can sleep in.If I get a good day in the yard working I don't need them to go to sleep.,F,52,6  months15 mg 1X AN,3/30/2016,Restoril
5, 2, trouble falling and staying asleep,Slight loss of memory and congnitime skills waking up_ numbness in limbs and shakiness. Restoril did absolutely nothing for me. I took the prescribed dosage_ slept for about 3-4 hours then I'd wake up and couldn't sleep. I started taking 2 pills (30mcg) still couldn't sleep. I literally took the medication an hour or more before bedtime and it would not help me at all. Needless to say it was frustrating because I just couldn't sleep. At one point I even took 3 and nothing. I stopped using the medication. It didn't help me.,,F,31,10  days15mcg,1/11/2016Email,Restoril
6, 4, sleep disorder,Relaxes  me and takes away my inhibitions. Memory loss.  Now able to sleep. Husband thinks it is a god send.,My family physician prescribed one 7.5 mg 1/2 hr before bedtime. That did not help. After a week he said to take two an hour before bedtime. That helped but I would wake up after 3 or 4 hrs and could not go back to sleep. Then he change the Dosage to 15 mg. 1 an hour before bed and the other about 15 to 20 minutes before bed.I do not take this unless my husband is home_ as I have had some uncharacteristic behavior. That is similar to the previous post.  But I now get a full night sleep_ with a very happy husband. This is only a band aid. I need to find a non chemical cure.,F,56,21  days15 2X D,12/9/2015,Restoril
7, 5, sleep disorder,I take one 15 mg at dinner then one 15 mg about 10 minutes before going to bed. I am out like a light for about an hour or two until my husband comes to bed. When he gets home I am horny as hell. I guess it take the edge off. Gat to have sex then I sleep like a baby.,Doc. put me on 15 mg but that does nothing the second tab work wonders.,F,59,2  months30 mg 1X D,12/8/2015,Restoril
8, 3, Insomnia,Nightmares,I have tried Ambien in the past-- only works for about 2-3 hours then restless night. Restoril works. I have taken it 5 times over two weeks. It gets me to sleep fairly quickly_ I sleep fairly well_ I dream_ the next morning I feel groggy. Now for the caveat! This drugs creates horrible nightmares and I NEVER have bad dreams. I have very troubling dreams-- one night rattle snakes in my kitchen were after me_ fast too_ I woke my self up. Another dream I walked in a room and the door locked behind me_ the room was filled with yellow jackets. Yes_ all the experiences one doesn't want to embrace. I wake up_ afraid to go back to sleep. I get one terrible event 4 out of 5 times I take it. Oh_ and another bonus to Restoril-- it stays in your system for 48 hours. I can tell my dreams don't return to normal for 2-days after not taking it. I may try taking a lessor amount_ but am afraid of the dreams.,M,56,2  weeks15 MG 1X AN,9/9/2015,Restoril
9, 5, extreme insomnia,None,This is the only way I can get sleep. I hate ambien as it causes dangerous sleepwalking. I was on 30 mgs restoril for many years until my wonderful new doctor put me on 15. I actually sleep better now without feeling so dependant.,F,43,8  years15mg,7/12/2015,Restoril
10, 2, Trouble falling asleep,Day one: woke up after very restful sleep to a terrible pounding headache in the right side of my head. Headache lasted the majority of the day.Day two: I just woke up at 3 AM (after falling asleep about 1 AM) from the most vivid_ stressful_ and upsetting dream I have ever had. Also woke up with the exact same headache I just finally got rid of less than eight hours ago.,The effects of Restoril on helping me fall asleep were stellar. Much more gentle and effective than Ambien. The side effect of the terrible headache is not one I'm capable of enduring_ and completely negates the benefit of being able to fall asleep quickly. The dream I just had (which I am sure is due to the Restoril since it and my reaction to it was completely out of character) is something that has me so stressed out that I'm terrified to fall back asleep now because of the chance it or something similar could recur.,F,37,2  days15mg,4/27/2015,Restoril
11, 5, Insomnia,I have been taking half a capsule a night 4 to 5 nights a week. It has been extremely effective with minimal side effects much better than those from insomnia. While my doctor is confident that it is quite safe I am not sure I have the same level of confidence. Studies appear to indicate it is safer than most other benzodiazepines but it feels time to rid myself of what has become a dependence. For short term use I have found nothing better.,,M,58,10  years15mg,3/28/2015Email,Restoril
12, 1, Can't stay asleep,Nothing,I got this prescribed today and took my first 30mg capsule 2 hours ago and feel. nothing_ no sleepiness_ no drowsiness _ nothing. I'm not tired at all.

15, 5, Insomnia,None,I loved this for insomnia--it was just the right strength to allow me to fall asleep within a normal time frame without making me overly sedated should I stay up on it. I could fall asleep in 20 minutes on it whereas without it took me hours. If I took it and chose to stay up and read or watch TV_ it did not incapacitate me. Very smooth_ very mellow_ and it worked.,M,29,4  monthsN/A 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Restoril
16, 3, Chronic Insomnia due to Lupus,None. I've been on benzo's in the past and have tolerated them well. I have a complicated medical history and take meds to help with symptoms. There doesn't appear to be any contraindications by adding this drug. I will say that although I fall asleep quite easily with this dosage_ I wake in 3-4 hours and cannot fall back to sleep again. I've requested a bump in dosage with the hope that my doctor will continue to prescribe 15 mg_ but 2x/night. I can live with 6 good hours of sleep.My mind is clear. I'm motivated during the day. Overall it's working much better than Lunesta and doesn't give me the night terrors that Ambien did.I'm a vivid/lucid dreamer_ but as a writer am happy that this med hasn't changed that.It's obviously not for everyone and when the day comes that I've built a tolerance to it_ will be proactive in weening off of it appropriately.Many comments have been posted about sudden withdrawal related to benzo's.People- read the drug information!! Talk to your doctors and pharmacists. And NEVER abruptly stop a prescription med. The warning is in black and white.Hope this helps.,,F,44,7  days15 mg,9/12/2014,Restoril
17, 5, Sleep,I believe I am more groggy tired out of it in the morning even after 12-14 hours goes by from the time I take it. But seems I need 60 mg to keep me sleeping a good -8-10 hr sleep.  My body does not seem to need more over time .. Maybe because Iam on such a high dose. I would like to take less actually. Need to talk to shrink about that.,,F,59,2  years60 mg,7/25/2014,Restoril
18, 1, Severe Insomnia,None; have not resumed taking this drug due to both its severely addictive properties and the complete lack of its being able to resolve my insomnia.  I was prescribed 30 MG_ and after only two weeks_ the drug entirely lost its effectiveness--which is very common for all benzos.  Stay away from this drug!,I would recommend in the strongest terms that anyone considering or being prescribed Restoril will decide not to take it or any other benzodiazepine_ as it will cease to work in the long-term_ you will have to take more of it_ and then you will have to go through withdrawal from it_ which is horrific.,F,49,0  days30 MG 1X D,6/17/2014EmailHistory,Restoril

22, 3, Restless Leg Syndrome,Loosing cognitive abilities_ memory and energy.  I feel really stupid a lot of the time...and yet I know that I am an intelligent person.  Increased appetite at the onset of taking my 30 mg......no other times.  Complete mental BLACK OUTS if I take 45 mg.  I have gotten up the next morning and to my horror realized things that I had either done or food I had eaten the night before...it was the same as when I used to get drunk. WOW.,Well what can I say...I love the feeling I get from Restoril.  It only takes 10 minutes to work and I love the drugged feeling I get.  I make sure not to eat dinner until I take my 30 mg._ otherwise I will not get such a strong feeling_ I will however still sleep great.  I never had a problem with sleeping....just began getting RLS a few years ago and this works great for that_ but now I don't know what to do_ because I am tired of feeling stupid and not being able to remember things.  I tried Trazodone and it really knocked me out_ but the memory and drugged affects are even worse for me than Restoril is.,F,62,3  years30 mg 1X D,1/1/2014Email,Restoril
23, 4, Severe secondary insomnia,A bit groggy_ also makes me need excessive amounts of sleep (10 hrs instead of about 8.5 -9),"I was on ""Lunesta"" (Zopilcone) for 8 years but when it no longer worked I had to go onto this. I also tried various sedative psycho drugs and some of them helped for a few years. I was on and off this for years too_ as it's only effective for max 1 week at a time. At the moment it's the only way I can get undisturbed sleep at night. I tapered off all hypnotics twice this autumn and it wasn't difficult for me at all_ but I had to go back on them since I wasn't able to get sufficient amounts of natural sleep and the other sedative alternatives all give me restless legs. I really don't want to be on this kind of thing but my insomnia is due to fibromyalgia and so I see no hope and don't think CBT will help in my case either.",F,47,6  days5 - 20 mg 1X D,12/11/2013Email,Restoril

I've been fighting my cpap mask at night on this Rx. I never had that happen with Klonopin.

I am 5 1/2 YEARS off and still suffering every second in protracted w.d . This pill had DESTROYED my life for the last 6 years. Doctors need to be sued for handing out benzos like tic tacs.

It doesn't help with insomnia at all and instead gets your body used to its effects and when the effects wear off at about 4 AM you wake up suddenly in a panic and/or rage.

Sometimes_ it doesn't work_ and sometimes_ I feel groggy in the morning_ but I usually get 5-6 hours of good sleep when I take it. It can take up to an hour before I fall asleep_ so I have to time it carefully. Take it too early_ and I'm wide awake at 4:30.

Xanax worked great .5-.75 to fall asleep 5 hrs at least_ but also stopped working.  Restoril seems to work well at this dose; 15mg wasn't enough to keep me asleep past 3-4 hrs.  I worry about needing this to sleep forever...tolerance and withdrawal scare me.  I am a retired PA w/lots of med experience and just wish I could fall asleep easily(spouse falls asleep in 1 minute_ stays asleep all night) and stay asleep.  Hot flashes_ my snoring husband_ my plugged up nose (pollen) and back pain all keep me awake.  Restoril helps a lot though and am glad for it_ all things considered.

39, 4, insomnia,calming_ drowsiness_ sometimes mild hangover/slugish feeling in the morning,"I seem to get a relaxed feeling about 45 to 60 min after taking it...my insomnia due to failed back surgery pain was so bad I'd go 3-4 days without a single SECOND of sleep_ only to then suffer what is termed ""microsleep"" - where you nod off for a few seconds.  The mmicrosleep was incontollable_ and came without warning_ so I was having frequent car accidents_ and falling out of a chair onto the floor at work.  After a few microsleep episodes_ I'd simply begin having grand mal srizures due to lack of sleep_ so restoril/temazepam has been a godsend.  Even after a full year_ it's still fairly effective_ tho I'm sure my tolerance has built up_ no doubt about it.  There are some nights I need to take 1_ then a second one an hour later_ or in the middle of the night_ but ""most of the time"" the one 30 mg pill works fine.  I DO notice I get a little anxious towards the end of the month_ afraid the doc won't refill it_ but so far_ he's been perfectly understanding of the sequence of events that happen without any sleep aid at all.  BTW - another thing that might be good for anybody reading this would be to try something called ""phenebut"" - it's available on-line_ and it's what the Russian cosmonauts use fo sleep in space.

40, 4, Insomnia,The only side effect that was somewhat bothersome was I would get very hungry.  Sometimes Restoril would not work either.  Sometimes I would want to take another capsule to make it 90 MG but I don't unless I really need to sleep as in for work or another early event.  I did take Xanax for years and I think that my tolerance just built up with that and I think that is what sometimes happens to me  with Restoril.  I am currently not taking Xanax anymore_ but the reason I was on it was for anxiety_ not to sleep.  I was on 1 MG three times a day_ but overall Restoril has worked the best for me for the most part.,I have had insomnia forever.  I have tried a range of sleeping aids.  I have tried Ambien and it works but I don't like the drunk and sleep eating side effects it had on me.  I have tried Trazadone_ Remeron_ and even Nyquil and Benadryl_ but the diphenhydramine in those drugs had a paradoxial effect and made me more wired then anything.  My doc said that Trazadone and Remeron act simlarly to Benadryl (diphenhydramine).  So even OTC drugs like Nyquil and Benadryl (diphenhydramine) did not work for me.  I have even tried natural sleep aids like Kava Kava_ Valerian Root_ and Melatonin_ which just weren't potent enough for me.,F,27,3  years60 MG 1X D,1/4/2012Email,Restoril

I take it & while waiting for it to ""work"" I develop an insatiable hunger.  For sweets.  It takes a little over an hour for me to fall asleep.  Then I sleep for about three hours and wake up with a pounding headache.  But three hours of sleep is better than NO sleep_ and I've tried all the other stuff_ including Ambien_ which was like taking caffeine pills.

Usually_ I just stay up all night  long and watch Adult Swim because it rarely works unless I'm a little tired. To be honest_ I could take 20 MG of Aderal_ and drink 3 cups of coffee 6 hrs before going to bed and sleep -sometimes- most of the time. I'll say 2/3 x's throughout the week it'll work. Sometimes even 2 to 3 MG of Klonopin with 75 to 90 MG of tam doesn't even do the trick. ); Talk about having a problem_ but at least the lack of sleep doesn't tamper with my 4.0.... yeaya!,I am a rare case do to my high tolerance to seds_ hyps_ and benzos.

51, 1, insomnia,none. no drowsiness_ no euphoria as one might expect on a higher dose with benzo-naive pt.  fewer sides than benedaryl or mirtazazpine_ at least_ which was a complete and horrifying disaster.,no effect.  not tired_ not sleepy.  doubled prescribed dose (15-30) in 30 minutes increments.  very disappointed since ambien worked like a charm for me for year and suddenly just stopped_ i have severe insomnia for years precded use of meds which were a last resort_ tried lunesta and sonata no luck_ something like temazapam was my last resort.  back to 1-2 hours a night if i am lucky.  hopefully i will experience some kind of miracle but on this swing shift i kind of doubt it.  hoping in a month ambien tolerance will wear off but wanted something i could use in the interim.,F,45,1  days60mg 1X D,2/23/2011,Restoril

53, 4, Insomnia,Side effects have included minor loss of short-term memory. Feeling a little foggy in cognitive process.,"I wish I wasn't totally dependent_ but I simply quit sleeping ""without help"" a few years ago. I can't function without good sleep. About 4 years ago_ I started on half of an Ambien_ and would find myself getting up around 2AM to take another half to stay asleep. Then I switched to Restoril 30MG. Worked great at first_ but now I'm waking up around 4AM every morning. I can usually go back to sleep on my own. So_ I can live with that. I am concerned about weaning off one day_ because I feel like I've lost the ability to fall asleep without it. I am interested in alternating sleep meds_ using Lunesta one day and then Restoril next day to increase effectiveness. Waiting for an MD appointment. I am also interested in alternative therapies and have been practicing yoga for relaxation.",F,40,1  years30 MG 1X D,2/10/2011,Restoril

55, 4, insomnia and restless leg sysndrome,I have more dreams that I do remember after waking up in the morning and I wake up because it makes me want to urinate.,I developed the insomnia because my roommate sleeps with the television full blast the entire nite and even though I use earplugs and an eye mask I could not stay asleep without the restoril. I wake up refreshed and ready for my daily cup of caffeine to get me started.,F,58,3  years30mg 1X D,1/30/2011,Restoril

58, 3, Insomnia,Vivid strange dreams_ somewhat lethargic feeling.,I've been taking this for maybe a little over a year and the dreams I have are ridiculously vivid and strange. It has come to the point where I actually have trouble getting up in the morning because I don't want the dream to end or want to hit the snooze button and slip back in. It doesn't leave me feeling hungover like other sleep meds_ but I definitely don't feel energetic in the morning.,M,29,1  years30 1X AN,11/16/2010,Restoril
59, 5, chronic lifelong insomnia,amazingly_ none whatsoever,I have been an insomniac all my life.  No matter how hard I try_ I have to take a sleeping pill.  In the 70s I took Dalmane_ which gives you a horrible hangover_ then the 80's came with the wonder drug halcion_ which i took for a very long time_ but it started not to work.  I went on restoril 30 mg every night_ and to this day it works perfectly.  I don't care about the addiction aspect_ any chronic insomniac like me would tell you that you're better off being addicted to a sleeping pill than not being able to sleep.  I have no intention of ever going off of these.,M,42,10  years30mg 1X D,10/25/2010,Restoril
