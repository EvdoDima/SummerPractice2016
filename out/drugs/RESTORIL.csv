0, 5, Insomnia,I have no side effects. I wake up around 5am ready to start my day.,I have to take it on an empty stomach or it takes hours to work. I also  take 1mg Lorazepam (also prescribed) and two Benedryl alergy tablets along with it.,F,72,10  years30 MG 1X D,8/11/2016,Restoril
1, 2, Insomnia,I take it 2 hrs before bed. Am lucky to sleep 3 hrs. No hangover effect_ but vivid dreams and severe restlessness.,Was recently diagnosed with lupus (SLE). Wondering if Restoril will eventually help me sleep.,F,65,5  days30mg,7/10/2016,Restoril
2, 5, insomnia,Morning hangover,Well I usually only review drugs when they are terrible_ but this one was actually pretty good. I've been dealing with insomnia for several months now and was prescribed restoril. It put me out quickly and would keep me out for about 7 hours. I would recommend this one. I also tried ambien. It was good too_just a little less sleep but no hangover at all.,M,27,7  days30 mg,4/27/2016,Restoril
3, 3, Insomnia,Vivid dreams_ headaches_ dry mouth_ irritability_ weight gain_ insomnia_ confusion or mental cloudiness_ joint swelling.,Have been on Restoril for a long time_ it's gotten to the point where I'm falling asleep at 2am and waking at 6am.,F,38,4  years30 MG,4/17/2016,Restoril
4, 3, Sleep,Reduce inhibitions_ leading to unacceptable behavior. Felt really tired the next morning if I did not get ten to twelve hours sleep.,After a month my body started getting accustomed to and behavior returned to normal. Now only take on Fridays and Saturdays night when I can sleep in.If I get a good day in the yard working I don't need them to go to sleep.,F,52,6  months15 mg 1X AN,3/30/2016,Restoril
5, 2, trouble falling and staying asleep,Slight loss of memory and congnitime skills waking up_ numbness in limbs and shakiness. Restoril did absolutely nothing for me. I took the prescribed dosage_ slept for about 3-4 hours then I'd wake up and couldn't sleep. I started taking 2 pills (30mcg) still couldn't sleep. I literally took the medication an hour or more before bedtime and it would not help me at all. Needless to say it was frustrating because I just couldn't sleep. At one point I even took 3 and nothing. I stopped using the medication. It didn't help me.,,F,31,10  days15mcg,1/11/2016Email,Restoril
6, 4, sleep disorder,Relaxes  me and takes away my inhibitions. Memory loss.  Now able to sleep. Husband thinks it is a god send.,My family physician prescribed one 7.5 mg 1/2 hr before bedtime. That did not help. After a week he said to take two an hour before bedtime. That helped but I would wake up after 3 or 4 hrs and could not go back to sleep. Then he change the Dosage to 15 mg. 1 an hour before bed and the other about 15 to 20 minutes before bed.I do not take this unless my husband is home_ as I have had some uncharacteristic behavior. That is similar to the previous post.  But I now get a full night sleep_ with a very happy husband. This is only a band aid. I need to find a non chemical cure.,F,56,21  days15 2X D,12/9/2015,Restoril
7, 5, sleep disorder,I take one 15 mg at dinner then one 15 mg about 10 minutes before going to bed. I am out like a light for about an hour or two until my husband comes to bed. When he gets home I am horny as hell. I guess it take the edge off. Gat to have sex then I sleep like a baby.,Doc. put me on 15 mg but that does nothing the second tab work wonders.,F,59,2  months30 mg 1X D,12/8/2015,Restoril
8, 3, Insomnia,Nightmares,I have tried Ambien in the past-- only works for about 2-3 hours then restless night. Restoril works. I have taken it 5 times over two weeks. It gets me to sleep fairly quickly_ I sleep fairly well_ I dream_ the next morning I feel groggy. Now for the caveat! This drugs creates horrible nightmares and I NEVER have bad dreams. I have very troubling dreams-- one night rattle snakes in my kitchen were after me_ fast too_ I woke my self up. Another dream I walked in a room and the door locked behind me_ the room was filled with yellow jackets. Yes_ all the experiences one doesn't want to embrace. I wake up_ afraid to go back to sleep. I get one terrible event 4 out of 5 times I take it. Oh_ and another bonus to Restoril-- it stays in your system for 48 hours. I can tell my dreams don't return to normal for 2-days after not taking it. I may try taking a lessor amount_ but am afraid of the dreams.,M,56,2  weeks15 MG 1X AN,9/9/2015,Restoril
9, 5, extreme insomnia,None,This is the only way I can get sleep. I hate ambien as it causes dangerous sleepwalking. I was on 30 mgs restoril for many years until my wonderful new doctor put me on 15. I actually sleep better now without feeling so dependant.,F,43,8  years15mg,7/12/2015,Restoril
10, 2, Trouble falling asleep,Day one: woke up after very restful sleep to a terrible pounding headache in the right side of my head. Headache lasted the majority of the day.Day two: I just woke up at 3 AM (after falling asleep about 1 AM) from the most vivid_ stressful_ and upsetting dream I have ever had. Also woke up with the exact same headache I just finally got rid of less than eight hours ago.,The effects of Restoril on helping me fall asleep were stellar. Much more gentle and effective than Ambien. The side effect of the terrible headache is not one I'm capable of enduring_ and completely negates the benefit of being able to fall asleep quickly. The dream I just had (which I am sure is due to the Restoril since it and my reaction to it was completely out of character) is something that has me so stressed out that I'm terrified to fall back asleep now because of the chance it or something similar could recur.,F,37,2  days15mg,4/27/2015,Restoril
11, 5, Insomnia,I have been taking half a capsule a night 4 to 5 nights a week. It has been extremely effective with minimal side effects much better than those from insomnia. While my doctor is confident that it is quite safe I am not sure I have the same level of confidence. Studies appear to indicate it is safer than most other benzodiazepines but it feels time to rid myself of what has become a dependence. For short term use I have found nothing better.,,M,58,10  years15mg,3/28/2015Email,Restoril
12, 1, Can't stay asleep,Nothing,I got this prescribed today and took my first 30mg capsule 2 hours ago and feel. nothing_ no sleepiness_ no drowsiness _ nothing. I'm not tired at all.

15, 5, Insomnia,None,I loved this for insomnia--it was just the right strength to allow me to fall asleep within a normal time frame without making me overly sedated should I stay up on it. I could fall asleep in 20 minutes on it whereas without it took me hours. If I took it and chose to stay up and read or watch TV_ it did not incapacitate me. Very smooth_ very mellow_ and it worked.,M,29,4  monthsN/A 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Restoril
16, 3, Chronic Insomnia due to Lupus,None. I've been on benzo's in the past and have tolerated them well. I have a complicated medical history and take meds to help with symptoms. There doesn't appear to be any contraindications by adding this drug. I will say that although I fall asleep quite easily with this dosage_ I wake in 3-4 hours and cannot fall back to sleep again. I've requested a bump in dosage with the hope that my doctor will continue to prescribe 15 mg_ but 2x/night. I can live with 6 good hours of sleep.My mind is clear. I'm motivated during the day. Overall it's working much better than Lunesta and doesn't give me the night terrors that Ambien did.I'm a vivid/lucid dreamer_ but as a writer am happy that this med hasn't changed that.It's obviously not for everyone and when the day comes that I've built a tolerance to it_ will be proactive in weening off of it appropriately.Many comments have been posted about sudden withdrawal related to benzo's.People- read the drug information!! Talk to your doctors and pharmacists. And NEVER abruptly stop a prescription med. The warning is in black and white.Hope this helps.,,F,44,7  days15 mg,9/12/2014,Restoril
17, 5, Sleep,I believe I am more groggy tired out of it in the morning even after 12-14 hours goes by from the time I take it. But seems I need 60 mg to keep me sleeping a good -8-10 hr sleep.  My body does not seem to need more over time .. Maybe because Iam on such a high dose. I would like to take less actually. Need to talk to shrink about that.,,F,59,2  years60 mg,7/25/2014,Restoril
18, 1, Severe Insomnia,None; have not resumed taking this drug due to both its severely addictive properties and the complete lack of its being able to resolve my insomnia.  I was prescribed 30 MG_ and after only two weeks_ the drug entirely lost its effectiveness--which is very common for all benzos.  Stay away from this drug!,I would recommend in the strongest terms that anyone considering or being prescribed Restoril will decide not to take it or any other benzodiazepine_ as it will cease to work in the long-term_ you will have to take more of it_ and then you will have to go through withdrawal from it_ which is horrific.,F,49,0  days30 MG 1X D,6/17/2014EmailHistory,Restoril

22, 3, Restless Leg Syndrome,Loosing cognitive abilities_ memory and energy.  I feel really stupid a lot of the time...and yet I know that I am an intelligent person.  Increased appetite at the onset of taking my 30 mg......no other times.  Complete mental BLACK OUTS if I take 45 mg.  I have gotten up the next morning and to my horror realized things that I had either done or food I had eaten the night before...it was the same as when I used to get drunk. WOW.,Well what can I say...I love the feeling I get from Restoril.  It only takes 10 minutes to work and I love the drugged feeling I get.  I make sure not to eat dinner until I take my 30 mg._ otherwise I will not get such a strong feeling_ I will however still sleep great.  I never had a problem with sleeping....just began getting RLS a few years ago and this works great for that_ but now I don't know what to do_ because I am tired of feeling stupid and not being able to remember things.  I tried Trazodone and it really knocked me out_ but the memory and drugged affects are even worse for me than Restoril is.,F,62,3  years30 mg 1X D,1/1/2014Email,Restoril
23, 4, Severe secondary insomnia,A bit groggy_ also makes me need excessive amounts of sleep (10 hrs instead of about 8.5 -9),"I was on ""Lunesta"" (Zopilcone) for 8 years but when it no longer worked I had to go onto this. I also tried various sedative psycho drugs and some of them helped for a few years. I was on and off this for years too_ as it's only effective for max 1 week at a time. At the moment it's the only way I can get undisturbed sleep at night. I tapered off all hypnotics twice this autumn and it wasn't difficult for me at all_ but I had to go back on them since I wasn't able to get sufficient amounts of natural sleep and the other sedative alternatives all give me restless legs. I really don't want to be on this kind of thing but my insomnia is due to fibromyalgia and so I see no hope and don't think CBT will help in my case either.",F,47,6  days5 - 20 mg 1X D,12/11/2013Email,Restoril

I've been fighting my cpap mask at night on this Rx. I never had that happen with Klonopin.

I am 5 1/2 YEARS off and still suffering every second in protracted w.d . This pill had DESTROYED my life for the last 6 years. Doctors need to be sued for handing out benzos like tic tacs.

It doesn't help with insomnia at all and instead gets your body used to its effects and when the effects wear off at about 4 AM you wake up suddenly in a panic and/or rage.

Sometimes_ it doesn't work_ and sometimes_ I feel groggy in the morning_ but I usually get 5-6 hours of good sleep when I take it. It can take up to an hour before I fall asleep_ so I have to time it carefully. Take it too early_ and I'm wide awake at 4:30.

Xanax worked great .5-.75 to fall asleep 5 hrs at least_ but also stopped working.  Restoril seems to work well at this dose; 15mg wasn't enough to keep me asleep past 3-4 hrs.  I worry about needing this to sleep forever...tolerance and withdrawal scare me.  I am a retired PA w/lots of med experience and just wish I could fall asleep easily(spouse falls asleep in 1 minute_ stays asleep all night) and stay asleep.  Hot flashes_ my snoring husband_ my plugged up nose (pollen) and back pain all keep me awake.  Restoril helps a lot though and am glad for it_ all things considered.

39, 4, insomnia,calming_ drowsiness_ sometimes mild hangover/slugish feeling in the morning,"I seem to get a relaxed feeling about 45 to 60 min after taking it...my insomnia due to failed back surgery pain was so bad I'd go 3-4 days without a single SECOND of sleep_ only to then suffer what is termed ""microsleep"" - where you nod off for a few seconds.  The mmicrosleep was incontollable_ and came without warning_ so I was having frequent car accidents_ and falling out of a chair onto the floor at work.  After a few microsleep episodes_ I'd simply begin having grand mal srizures due to lack of sleep_ so restoril/temazepam has been a godsend.  Even after a full year_ it's still fairly effective_ tho I'm sure my tolerance has built up_ no doubt about it.  There are some nights I need to take 1_ then a second one an hour later_ or in the middle of the night_ but ""most of the time"" the one 30 mg pill works fine.  I DO notice I get a little anxious towards the end of the month_ afraid the doc won't refill it_ but so far_ he's been perfectly understanding of the sequence of events that happen without any sleep aid at all.  BTW - another thing that might be good for anybody reading this would be to try something called ""phenebut"" - it's available on-line_ and it's what the Russian cosmonauts use fo sleep in space.

40, 4, Insomnia,The only side effect that was somewhat bothersome was I would get very hungry.  Sometimes Restoril would not work either.  Sometimes I would want to take another capsule to make it 90 MG but I don't unless I really need to sleep as in for work or another early event.  I did take Xanax for years and I think that my tolerance just built up with that and I think that is what sometimes happens to me  with Restoril.  I am currently not taking Xanax anymore_ but the reason I was on it was for anxiety_ not to sleep.  I was on 1 MG three times a day_ but overall Restoril has worked the best for me for the most part.,I have had insomnia forever.  I have tried a range of sleeping aids.  I have tried Ambien and it works but I don't like the drunk and sleep eating side effects it had on me.  I have tried Trazadone_ Remeron_ and even Nyquil and Benadryl_ but the diphenhydramine in those drugs had a paradoxial effect and made me more wired then anything.  My doc said that Trazadone and Remeron act simlarly to Benadryl (diphenhydramine).  So even OTC drugs like Nyquil and Benadryl (diphenhydramine) did not work for me.  I have even tried natural sleep aids like Kava Kava_ Valerian Root_ and Melatonin_ which just weren't potent enough for me.,F,27,3  years60 MG 1X D,1/4/2012Email,Restoril

I take it & while waiting for it to ""work"" I develop an insatiable hunger.  For sweets.  It takes a little over an hour for me to fall asleep.  Then I sleep for about three hours and wake up with a pounding headache.  But three hours of sleep is better than NO sleep_ and I've tried all the other stuff_ including Ambien_ which was like taking caffeine pills.

Usually_ I just stay up all night  long and watch Adult Swim because it rarely works unless I'm a little tired. To be honest_ I could take 20 MG of Aderal_ and drink 3 cups of coffee 6 hrs before going to bed and sleep -sometimes- most of the time. I'll say 2/3 x's throughout the week it'll work. Sometimes even 2 to 3 MG of Klonopin with 75 to 90 MG of tam doesn't even do the trick. ); Talk about having a problem_ but at least the lack of sleep doesn't tamper with my 4.0.... yeaya!,I am a rare case do to my high tolerance to seds_ hyps_ and benzos.

53, 4, Insomnia,Side effects have included minor loss of short-term memory. Feeling a little foggy in cognitive process.,"I wish I wasn't totally dependent_ but I simply quit sleeping ""without help"" a few years ago. I can't function without good sleep. About 4 years ago_ I started on half of an Ambien_ and would find myself getting up around 2AM to take another half to stay asleep. Then I switched to Restoril 30MG. Worked great at first_ but now I'm waking up around 4AM every morning. I can usually go back to sleep on my own. So_ I can live with that. I am concerned about weaning off one day_ because I feel like I've lost the ability to fall asleep without it. I am interested in alternating sleep meds_ using Lunesta one day and then Restoril next day to increase effectiveness. Waiting for an MD appointment.

It has come to the point where I actually have trouble getting up in the morning because I don't want the dream to end or want to hit the snooze button and slip back in.

In the 70s I took Dalmane_ which gives you a horrible hangover_ then the 80's came with the wonder drug halcion_ which i took for a very long time_ but it started not to work.  I went on restoril 30 mg every night_ and to this day it works perfectly.  I don't care about the addiction aspect_ any chronic insomniac like me would tell you that you're better off being addicted to a sleeping pill than not being able to sleep.

60, 5, Insomnia,No noticeable side effects,"I don't take Temazepam everyday_ only 30mg (initial 15mg did nothing) as needed_ 2-4 times every couple of weeks.  MY MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Slight GAD (not too bad_ mostly when trying to fall asleep)_ Panic Attacks (Xanax for that_ not so often once diagnosed & treated for ADHD - my H=HYPERreactive &  HYPERsensitive)_ Adult ADHD (Adderall 10mg 2-3 times daily).  Work Evenings/Nights in a Hospital for the past 13 years.  I have been prescribed Ambien_ Lunesta_ and  tried natural alternatives.  Restoril is one of the older prescription sleeping aides on the market_ it's been around for a long time.  ****SAFETY NOTE:  Temazepam has been proven unsafe for anyone trying or just not protecting themselves from getting pregnant.  It has been shown to cause birth defects.****  My saving grace... I had a hard time falling asleep on Ambien and when I did I only slept for a few hours; Lunesta put me to sleep but I would wake 2-4 hours after and would have terrible anxiety.  Neither one ever made me feel ""rested"".  I have even tried doubling my xanax dose (@ 0.5mg) it does put me to sleep but I have terrible grogginess/drugged feeling the next day.  Restoril is the only prescription sleep med that has worked.  I sleep through the entire night and like some other people here if I do wake I dont feel anxious and can fall right back to sleep.

It gives me another 4 hours or so of sleep - wonderful.  I've had to take breaks_ a couple of days at a time_ occasionally_ to keep it effective. I learned that it works by increasing the efficiency of the brain's GABA receptors_ so recently when it began to wear off too quickly I tried taking GABA (750mg) along with it.  It worked so well that I haven't needed a break and haven't needed to increase my doseage of temazepam beyond the half capsule I've always taken (7.5mg). For me it's as close to natural unmedicated sleep that I have found.  I love it.,F,59,2  years7.5mg 1X D,9/3/2010Email,Restoril

I was more awake after taking it then I was before I took it.

The Ambien was not working as well after 2 years and he said taking a month off would get be good for me. The tamazepam he prescribed was to help me sleep during this process. Well_ I don't know if I am just having Ambien withdrawals_ but after taking 30 mgs per night_ I have not slept much at all. I don't want to take a higher dose because I don't want a tolerance to that one too. I am very tired_ and not totally happy with the results of this drug. It may work better for someone who has never taken a sleep aid before. Just didn't work all that well for me.,F,33,7  days30 MG 1X D,8/17/2010,Restoril

66, 4, ,Tiredness_ lethargy_ agitation_ depression_ mood swings_ and increase in anxiety.,I have worked in the medical field for 27 years and currently work in a MD office.  I was prescribed Restoril when I was unable to take any other sleep aids_ i.e. Lunesta_ Ambien_ etc.  I have a paradoxyl effect (opposite effect) to sleep aids and they would make me hyper and keep me up all night.  As Restoril has been known to be prescribled with people who suffer from Restless Leg Syndrome_ the physician I worked for told me to try 30 mg. nightly.  The Restoril worked great.  I slept 7-8 hours and woke up feeling good.  I have been taking it for a little over a year_ every night_ and I am now experiencing mood swings_ agitation_ severe depression and increased ADD symptoms.  I now need to start tapering off the medication but have anxiety about what I will do and how I will react.  This medication works great for some people but should not be taken for a long period of time.  I had no idea I had become as dependent upon it as I have.  Be careful when taking this medication.  It should not be taken every night like I have been taking it.,F,44,1  years30 mg 1X D,8/2/2010,Restoril

Having had insomnia off and on for years the dr. finally prescribed me trazodone which did not work at all.  I didn't like the idea of having to take drugs to sleep and after trazadone figured i was condemned to a life of intermittent zombie sleepless-states.  But temazepam worked!  someone complained that they still wake_ and this does happen to me after about 5 hours_ but 5 hours is fantastic for me compared to 0.  I haven't taken it long enough to notice any dependence but I do plan to use for a few more days_ and hopefully by then i will be reset to better sleep mode and will only have to take it intermittently,F,29,3  days15-30mg 1X D,7/31/2010Email,Restoril

I began with it because I was waking up with migraines - my husband reported to my doctor (and to me) that I was clenching my teeth (not grinding) in my sleep - job stress ?? So he prescribed it as a relaxant. 10 years later - I became a teacher - still stressful_ but for 10 weeks in the summer I wean myself off of it and only take it if I have a PM migraine (actually Advil PM works better).  During the school year I return to taking it every night. It has not lost its effectiveness for me (probably because of the break I take from it in the summer).

After years of using Ambien_ I wanted to try something else primarily to see if I'd developed any addiction issues to Ambien.  (No_ btw.) Well_ even the 30 mg. dose does nothing for me w/out a boost. I take no other meds so two nights ago I tried combining with a OTC sleep aid at 8 p.m._ then the restoril at 10 and I slept but even then only for 4 hours and with waking several times. On it's own_ it's done nothing for me.  I hate that it's a capsule.  I'd like to try and up the dose one night and see others have_ but jumping from 30 to 60 makes me nervous.

75, 1, insomnia,Fell asleep quickly_ but woke frequently during the night. After about 4 hours had to get up and take some xanax_ my daytime anxiety med. Unbelievable hangover. No way would I drive feeling this way. No headache or nausea but feel as if I'm made of mercury or molten lead. Dropped to 7.5 mg last night. Just as bad.,I asked for this med because I'm trying not to use too much xanax_ which I was taking to get to sleep (1.5mg) as well as for daytime anxiety. I took restoril for about 6 years in the '90s and thought it was fabulous_ no hangovers_ etc. Now obviously it's like a totally different drug for me. I've recently tried zopiclone (Canadian Lunesta) and trazodone. The former made me feel like I had no self and the latter made me a zombie and beat the hell out of my memory_ as well as giving me bad dreams. So now it's back to 1.5mg xanax an hour before bed_ only problem being its short half-life_ 4-6 hours_ for which reason I will ask my shrink if I can try clonazepam with its longer half-life.,M,63,5  days15mg 1X D,5/8/2010Email,Restoril

Built up tolerance quickly_ but never exceeded reccomended dose of 1 per night.,I am addicted to this drug after almost 3 years.  I started out with one 30mg a couple of times a week_ then it quickly became every night.  I tried to stop suddenly but went into major withdrawal.  I am now under doctor supervision with tapering off.  It will take many weeks_ even up to a year.  I am scared to death of this drug and would never reccomend it to anyone.  It is a highly addictive benzoid and I feel it should not be prescibed in the large amounts that were given to me. I am having a tough time even with tapering off.  I get up with withdrawal symptoms.  I've heard it is harder to detox than heroine because it has such a long half life.  One dose is in your blood up to 8 days.  Never just quit this drug.

99, 4, insomnia,None.,I have taken 15 mg for the last few years_ and although I really have no side effects_ I am developing a tolerance for it. I used to have no problem falling asleep_ but couldn't stay asleep. Now I'm having problems with both. So I'm taking 15mg to get to sleep_ then another 15mg in the middle of the night. On top of that_ I've started taking Melatonin with the temazepam_ which has worked so that I can fall asleep faster (temazepam could take 20 min to an hour to work for me). I am having tests done for hormonal and neurotransmitter levels. After 16 years of taking different drugs_ I need to find the root of the problem_ so that I don't just keep putting a bandaid on it. I want to get off these sedatives_ feel better_ and get my clear thinking back.,F,50,3  years,11/4/2008Email,Restoril
100, 5, insomnia,Very dizzy if I wasn't in bed right away. Habit forming.,Make sure you are in bed no longer than 10 minutes after taking it. I took 30mg doses. I decided I wanted to try getting off so much prescription medicine so I stopped taking it about 3 months ago and I still have trouble falling asleep at night. Seriously considering getting back on it. I fell asleep fast_ stayed asleep_ and woke up feeling refreshed. No drowsiness or memory loss. It was great.,F,20,9  months,11/2/2008,Restoril
101, 2, insomnia,I typically fall asleep but wake up within 3 hours and can't go back to sleep.Resoril has done nothing for me other than let me doze back off after I wake up 7 times each night.I'm only trying the 15 mg_ and it only seems to let me sleep lightly - I'm still waking up and getting up and down all night. Frustrating.I see where other patients in this column are taking much larger doses than I am; maybe 15 mg is much too little to give me the night's sleep I'm craving. Honestly at this point I don't care to even take another Restoril tonight. Ineffective for me at this dosage.Will get back with my doctor today to get his opinion. Have had insomnia for 4 months now. I just want to truly sleep and rest while sleeping.Just one night of real rest would be bliss.,,F,42,7  days,10/13/2008,Restoril
102, 4, severe_ lifelong insomnia_ anxiety,morning wooze_ forgetfulness,I was taking ambien and they switchhed me. Ambien had stopped working but I will probably switch back to it in a few weeks when this one stops working. It's the first time I've been prescribed a benzo.It definitely makes me sleepy. Also confused. I take it in bed about half an hour or so before I want to fall asleep. I feel groggy the next morning_ though_ but ambien did the same.I take the 15mg dose at night. In the daytime if I am feeling strong anxiety I take a half dose. Sometimes it helps_ and other times it just makes me tired. It takes too long to kick in to really do any good for that anyway.it's all right. It puts me to sleep well enough for now but I hear too much about withdrawal to want to continue taking it for very long.,F,36,7  days,10/3/2008,Restoril

106, 4, Insomnia,Euphoric if taken too soon_ i.e. before getting in bed,Restoril has been a wonder drug for me. It is the only way I can get 6-7 solid hours of sleep. I suffer from chronic insomnia and tried all of the other sleeping pills on the market and had horrible side effects. I take the 22.5 mg pill. On REALLY bad nights I take 2 of these but generally one does the trick.  If I do wake up I go right back to sleep.

It just made me panic more at night because I though I should be sleeping and was not.  60mg of Restoril is perfect.  I fall asleep_ but I am not knocked out. I wake up throughout the night on and off because of noise but I fall back asleep in a few minutes.  I am a light sleeper still on the 60mg dose_ but at least I can finally sleep for several hours.  I think I would have fallen apart under the stress without the help of this medication.

I take 15 mg each nite while I'm already in bed reading and within 1/2 hr I'm out like a light; I do wake up a few times but go right back to sleep...this is a big improvement for me; I was waking up every hour and got virtually no deep sleep; now I have lovely dreams...nighttime entertainment!

If I take it too early_ my husband tells me I ramble_ get on the computer_ and want to call friends or my mom (and often do_ spending an hour or more on the phone_ only to not recall ANY of the conversation!).,Despite the blackouts_ this is the only thing that really helps me sleep well. I do worry about taking it long-term and think I'm probably addicted. Have been taking it most nights for the past several months.

This drug made me very agitated_ spacey_ tried pulling my IV out_ ripping my blood pressure cuff off. By the time my Wife came in I looked like I was punch drunk. I also had a massive headache later that night. Just like a hangover.,This drug is dangerous and should be taken off the market.  I'm thankful I was hospitalized at the time.

125, 5, Insomnia and Anxiety,Was prescribed 30 capsules of 30mg. After taking the 30mg before bedtime_ I would still be awake for hours_ so I would have to take another 30mg about 3 hours later but would still wake up every 90 minutes_ however this time I would actually fall back asleep easily. No euphoria_ just slight dizziness and very minor memory loss. In the morning no adverse effects at all. I am very much UN-concerned about addiction and though benzo withdrawl is unpleasant_ try to keep a reserve stash for emergencies_ or taper down in dosage before running out before refill time. This sort of discipline goes a long way.,I have tried everything from herbs to beer to Ambien. Nothing worked. I find Restoril a mild anxiolytic compared to say Xanax. For insomnia there is no equal. I think there is a stigma against benzos and narcotic-type painrelievers for that matter. Fact is though_ you have to do something or you may just lose your mind.

I do have some muscle twitching_ not sure if its the other drugs i'm taking for depression. Not sure if its contributing to my depression_ as i seem to be on a roller coaster with the depression.,Definitely it helped me sleep_ but I would recommend not taking it on a long term basis or talking to your doctor about other meds that would help you sleep that don't have the addictive component.

I tried one pill and slept 7 hours for the first time in months.  I used 10 mg. for one week and slept every night through.  Before that_ I was lucky to go 4 hours before waking up.  Also_ I had tried all kinds of sleep meds and nothing worked except Lunesta_ that gave me a funny feeling when I woke up.

It is the benzodiazepine I have used the most (second most was clonazepam).  I prefer temazepam over all other benzos for sleep because of its ideal lenghth of effect and relatively low addiction potential.  There is one particular note of importance regarding this medication:  To avoid tolerance_ use the stimulant Provigil.  Somehow_ Provigil used in the morning obliviates tolerance problems that temazepam tends to do otherwise.  As recent as yesterday_ I let my psychiatrist know that little tid-bit.  I recommend that anyone using Restoril notify their doctor of that recommendation.,M,43,14  years,9/13/2005Email,Restoril
