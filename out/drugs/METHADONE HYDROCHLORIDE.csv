2, 3, I was diagnosed with cancer in 2010,Dry mouth_ constipation_ really tired to the point that if I sit down for a moment I fall asleep.  I get so tired my whole body aches alot_ my body jerks_ my joints hurt and I feel real stiff.  I've woke myself up doing things with my hands in the air.  My daughter told me once that I feel asleep with my hand in the air and just held it there for a long time. I start to fall asleep while driving_ so now some one else drives me or if I feel a little bit tired I pull over and rest. It really scares me because I have 3 young children. I'm on 20 mg of Ritalin twice a day to keep me awake so I can care for my kids and function during the day. My memory is real bad and many times I feel like I'm in a fog. I forget things.  They kept me on the methadone after the cancer because the radiation therapy gave me neuropathy. But at least I'm alive to raise my beautiful children. It can be hard when you feel like you're fighting with your body every day just to function to do what you need to do and do right by your kids.,Also on gabapentin and oxycodone for the neuropathy. On meds for thyroid_ acid reflux_ and Lisinopril for my kidneys.,F,53,5  years70 mg/day,3/28/2016Email,Methadone hydrochloride
3, 5, Chronic Back Pain,Only side effect I have is constipation.  But my pain doctor prescribed Movantik_ a narcotic constipation medicine.,This medicine is the best medicine for chronic pain.  This medicine gets a bad reputation_ but if you take as prescribed works better then anything else.  The biggest downfall is if you have to stop taking it_ withdrawal is very difficult and painful.,M,47,8  months5MG 3X D,3/17/2016,Methadone hydrochloride
4, 5, Back Surgery & Fibronyalgia pain,dry mouth,This is the miracle pain killer with least amount of side effects that has kept me as a productive working citizen.Hard to believe the doses given on here and the side effects are caused by those high doses. You should not take this medication to the point of total pain relief. I have been on my dose of 5mg 2 x day for 15 years with occasional raise to 10 mg to see if helps more_ but side effects outway the gain. This drug is tarnished by drug addiction stereotyping_ when it could be used o improve so many more lives. At this time my pain doctor tries to get me off this medication on a yearly basis & I do try. This past Fall_ she told me that if I continued with methadaone_ that I would eventually not be able to have sexual relations with my wife. I agreed to try to get off methadone and went onto Suboxen (used to help get off methadone & as pain killer). The only problem was that when I would take only half of dissolving pill under my tongue_ I would lose pain_ but I would also lose consciousness. *The worst side effect to Suboxen is that I could no longer feel my Genitals to be able to start urinating & could not ejaculate. Ah_ exactly what she said Methadone would cause.So_ after staying on for 2 months to see if side effects would go away_ I asked to get off Suboxen and my Doctor argued with me that my symptoms were impossible. I would not back down & told her that since my body should no longer be dependent on Methadone_ that I would try one of the we,M,49,15  years5 2X D,1/15/2016Email,Methadone hydrochloride

12, 5, Back and hop pain.,The only side effects I get from the methadone is a little constipation. But I make sure to eat plenty of fiber in my diet.,I've been on Methadone now for 14 years and let me tell you.  I never thought in my entire life that I would be able to finish school and get my degree and hold down a great paying job. It's to easy for me to abuse other medications and methadone is the only one that has worked for me over the years.  I know to some of you that 160 mg a day might seem a little high.  But once I found the right dosage_ I never had to change it and it's been 12 years on that level. I don't take anything else because it's too easy to abuse other pain meds. I stopped drinking and using. For me methadone has been a God send. I really never thought that I would be a productive member of society. And look at me now.  I have 4 kids and still married after 15 years and I have a good paying job. It really has been a great medication for me.  For others it may not work as well. But different strokes for different folks.,M,50,10  years160mg,6/29/2015,Methadone hydrochloride

I was born with a genetic complication with my Pancreas called Divisum that is very rare. It can be exacerbated by food_ alcohol_ infection and drugs. Being rare it was a difficult road and took years before accurate diagnosis. I went through pure hell with abdominal pain thought to be ""gas"" in my teens to accusations of alcohol induced pancreatitis in my 20s until a surgeon recognized it. I had a car accident that led to opiate addiction which caused severe pancreatitis that became chronic. At that time in 06-07_ I went on Methadone(90mg) for 9 months. At that time_ I had every single horrific side effect and I couldn't work due to nodding out. I was over medicated but in severe pain. The drug covered underlying infection and I couldn't wean because I was in so much pain!  I didn't understand until I ended up in the hospital for 3 MONTHS. As it went back into remission_ I detoxed and was able to be clean for 4 years. In 2013_ I was on track_ eating clean and in the best shape of my life!!  Well_ pancreatitis came back out of nowhere. Not kidding!  And it was wicked_ extraordinarily sick with liver enzymes in the 1000s(normal 20-65); vomiting nonstop until I ruptured a stomach vessel. I was once again on high end opiates and then my dr wanted me to do Methadone again for pain. Reluctantly_ I agreed and for 3 months again found myself in ZOMBIEville with dose at 40mg through day with oxy for breakthrough.

Extremely addictive.,I wish I had never started this drug. While it got rid of my pain_ I am physically addicted to it. If I go without 2 doses I feel like I'm crawling out of my skin- horrible withdrawals. I panicked if I think I don't have enough to get me to my next rx.

I can live a normal life with my family :). I have very little break through pain_ nothing an ibuprofen can't take care of. I plan to be on this medicine the rest of my life. I had 2 back surgeries with the 2nd one being a bi-level spinal fusion and it messed me up :( my dr said I have what is called failed back surgery. I also have nerve damage on my right side_ osteoporosis _ and arthritis . So yes methadone takes care of that for me to live a normal life_ I have a very active 2yr old that I am able to play with and a 14yr old daughter that is happy to see her momma awake cause the other meds are my devil. Sorry for a little of my life story_ lol_ but thank you for reading it. Do not let the people who stereo type methadone as only something for junkies because it's NOT true .

26, 5, Lower back and leg(s)pain.,Constipation and a bit of sleepiness.,I used to take Vicodin in the summer of 2006 after my back surgery_ went through physical therapy_ the pain was almost gone_ but it was bearable. Fast forward to 2012 and the pain returned to my lower back and legs. My usual doctor prescribed hydrocodone that did not work; and refused to give something stronger. My partner was on oxycodone and soma; and he gave me one to take for the pain; and it helped. I've found a new pain management doctor_ but he only prescribed me the oxycodone and soma only once because he was afraid of the DEA; and wanted to force me to take shots in my back and I have a big phobia of needles! The shots hurt like hell and they didn't work at all! After trying to find a pain management place that show compassion_ I've found one that really listened to me. My doctor sent me to get an MRI and it shown the problem. Even though he'd like me to consider surgery and injections_ he put me on methadone at 5 mg which helped a little. The next month he upped the mg to 10 mg @ 4 times at day. Let me tell you...it really works!! The pain diminished_ I can go on walks without pain_ able to do some household chores (not as fast as I'd like but am grateful)_ do food shopping_ and even can make love with my partner without screaming from back pain. The only downside is constipation_ but I use stool softners and gentle laxatives to take care of that; and a bit of sleepiness_ but I can handle that. I am so glad my pain management doctor has me on methadone for long term,M,48,3  months10 mg 4X D,7/13/2014,Methadone hydrochloride

All thouse things would have been pawned or money would have been spent on heroine if I never joined the clinic _ I was able to stay in school although after a year of being on the same dosage it only lasts tell about 5am-3pm enough time for school although I would rather lay in bed high so after a year I school (collage) I'm quiting to work... Possibly get on welfare or SSI_ We'll see how that goes.. Anyways it saved my life in a way where with my heroin addiction I would have been able to do all the things I've done in the last year without being flat broke_ in jail_ or out of school_ I spent 4 grand in student loans on heroine in 3 months I literally only had enough money for 1 month worth of the clinic when I started (good choice) without it at the time I would have been broke kicked out of school_ kicked out of home_ and still addicted....

Sugar cravings_ poor hygiene_ zombie-like_ fuzzy thinking_ poor short-term memory. Comments: with all these side effects you are probably wondering why I rated this med a 3. Due to the fact that I suffer from bipolar_ ocd_ GAD with panic attacks_ I must say I've had to weigh out the benefits and which were the lesser evils of the two. My cravings are 100% gone for 6 years so that has been a relief. Ill be honest_ if I can go back in time I would not have started methadone. I am completely dependent on it and am extremely scared of coming off. Liquid handcuffs is right. I am a 30 year old educated woman and sadly on my  way to what we here in the clinics call a ""lifer."" It has taken the sharp edges off my depression and gives me a peaceful feeling but if I was being honest with myself the peaceful feeling is me being high. My days are in a haze. I have barely         any motivation to even get my behind out of bed. I wish I was strong enough to just get off.

Can't handle waking in the middle of the night due to extreme itchiness all over body and to the point of being sick. Since I started taking the meds on Aug 25th; I have hiccups at least 3-4 times a day. And the swelling of my ankles_ feet_ legs - I just look awful and it hurts to wear shoes. I noticed the other day I am starting to get a bit of a rash here and there too.  I just can't handle this med anymore.  Started taking it because the pdoc says it would be cheaper for me to take since I have no insurance currently - compared to my regular medication which would have cost way too much.,F,43,10  days5 mg 3X D,9/4/2011Email,Methadone hydrochloride

I have a fantastic job that requires me to travel some and attend very important meetings and the clinic i attend will not excuse me but 1-2 times and it's just a mess then. I am ready to detox due to this clinics rules_ which i understand they do have_ but when a person does right they should have a little repect and consideration for them and this clinic doesn't.

60, 5, pain management,Drowsiness_ sweat easily,When I first started taking this stuff it really was uncomfortable. There were no nasty side effects other than feeling like I was in the fog. The best part however is that I have not had to increase my dosage and in fact am way down_ only 10mg twice daily. In addition to that my pain is controlled quite nicely. It no longer makes me tired it has never made me loopy like most narcotics. All in all this stuff is much cheaper and way more reliable than the usual narcotic analgesics. I have tried_ vicodin all stregths_ oxycodone_ morphine_ dilauded and on and on. All of which worked OK but made me loopy and needed more rather quicly_ like weeks. Anyone with chronic pain should at least consider this if you are to be on anything long term. The only real big pitfall is it is very addictive physically and getting off it is much more difficult than other opiate based narcotics.

I can't focus or concentrate my mind and I fade in and out of consciousness for up to 12 hours at a time_ all the while having odd hallucinatory ""dreams.""  Despite the fact I seem to sleep constantly on this stuff_ I'm still completely exhausted once it wears off so evidently the ""sleep"" I get while on methadone is not of good quality.  I finally started cutting my 10mg pills into EIGHTHS which seems to help reduce the mental side effects_ but the painkilling effectiveness is significantly reduced as well_ obviously.  Often I choose to just endure my pain rather than have this stuff blast my cognitive function.  Lastly_ I'm very concerned with what I'm reading here about tooth decay.  Not cool!

Well since I used to love methadone and could easily get into a clinic I chose this route. Was doing 560 mg of oxycontin a day at the time and the first day they gave me 30mg of that ass nasty red cherry liquid. I went up to 170mg in 6 months and stayed there for another 2.5 years. Well last October I started a slow 5mg per week taper. I got down to 5mg by the end of April and jumped off at 5mg. It's been really rough. Very tired_ depressed_ suicidal thoughts_ anxiety_ the poops_ kicking and twisting in bed_ cannot adjust my temperature. It's not as intense of a withdrawal as oxy but it's so much longer that I now dispise this and any opiate. For this is the end of the opiate trail for me. Oxy 4 day withdrawal of hell. Methadone 30+ days of slow agony_ Suboxone 30+ days of slower agony. They all suck arse to come off of.

Constipation_ and in the beginning of treatment extreme drowsiness.,While I began using opiates as a needed prescription for chronic pain due to a back injury and from effects of having Lupus_ I quickly began abusing the drugs for the euphoric effects and for rectreational use.

At the end I couldn't even feel the euphoric effects anymore_ I had to take the drugs just to keep myself out of withdrawl and so I could function and get out of bed. Methadone has SAVED my life.

I dont get tired (never did even from beginning with narcs) and I never had constipation til about 2-3months ago. I feel that happened due to my diet. Methadone does make you crave extreme high doses of sugar. I take this drug after i tried kadian_ morphine_ Oxycontin and percocet. It was honestly the best move i ever made and wish I had done it sooner . It does effect your teeth over long term use as it has started to effect mine . And although it hasnt happened to me it can effct bone marrow also over long term use.,I have been on Narcotics for almost 6 years now and find methadone has worked the ebst for me pain wise . My Husbands friend who was a pharmacist told him to tell me to ask my Dr about it . I refused to for a year. I wish I had back then. I been taking it now since 2006. I use 60mg of methadone per day with 90mg of Roxicone per day for breah through pain.ALL Narcotics are going to have some side effects so there isnt any perfect drug out there and everyone reacts different. If I could and at times I do_ I recommend asking for this drug for pain. If you have been in pain for a long time and hve a real understanding Pain physician you shouldnt have any problems getting it . I know thats also easier said than done .

The surgeon who botched the job referred me to a pain specialist who_ after seven years_ had advanced in his trust and care enough to give me one percocet every 8 hours. He had me sold on medtronic and a spinal cord stimulator_ until I found out from the surgeon (my pain specialist said nothing) that the procedure would require a laminotomy_ similar in action but not as radical as the laminectomy that ruined me. Needless to say_ I walked out of the office and never looked back. Finally_ I met a pain specialist who prescribed me 20mg of methadone_ 3x/day_ w/2mg of dilaudid every 6-8hrs as needed for breakthrough pain.

92, 5, Opiate addiction and Fibromyalgia,Its hard to tell which are side effects of methadone and which are from the Fibromyalgia so I'll do my best to list them.1. Sweating and being hot - the summers are nightmarish. I used to be cold natured_ not anymore_ 80 degrees starts feeling hot.2. Mind Fog - Caused from Fibromyalgia and made worse from the methadone? I don't know but it seems worse since I've been on Methadone and also since I hit my head in a wreck where I flipped my neighbors suv.3. Constipation - I go regularly now_ pretty much every morning BEFORE I dose but after I dose it's a rare thing to have a movement.  Every time I go up on in Mg. on methadone I usually cannot have a movement for weeks or longer.  Also_ my poop no longer comes out all in one chunk_ It kinda breaks off into little balls_ weird. Sorry for the awful mental picture :(4. Tiredness_ nodding off - I nod off a lot_ especially if I don't get enough sleep at night.  With Fibromyalgia I notice that I do not sleep very deeply and rarely dream,I got onto Methadone primarily to help with my Opiate addiction. I was having to take at least 1 pill/hr. to keep the sickness at bay.I felt so sick when I didnt have any.   I suffer from Fibromyalgia which is why I started taking the pills in the 1st place.   So I got onto methadone and was very amazed. I didnt have any withdrawal symptoms that night or the next day. I had found my wonder drug. I did get a rush off of the methadone for the 1st month or two but that went away and left me with a medicine that helped my pain very well & also freed me from any withdrawal symptoms.  But over time I kept having to go up and up on my doses and now I just don't feel well anymore.

Duragesic patches work about the same_ but I get extremely sleepy with them. The patches cost about $50.00 a piece also. I also don't experience withdrawl symptoms if I stop taking methadone like most other opioids (contrary to most other people who've posted here).I have noticed that any other meds used for breakthrough pain don't work as well when I take Methadone.

Took the percs for 2 weeks during which i would go a few days without any and then break down and take 1 or 2 for relief.

I don't consider this a miracle drug. To be honest with you_ I would much rather be clear from methadone and be on nothing. Though_ for someone like me who has been taking anti-pills my whole life and nothing has worked_ you have to do what you can to survive. It's better then overdosing on drugs or committing suicide because you can't deal with the pain of your depression. Now_ I am also a better_ happier mother to my 3 year old son.

Yes_ there is still pain_ but it is not of the nature where it interferes in my life anywhere near as much as it had in the past.

As a young boy they  would let everyone in the neighbord hood know I was not to be fucked with or harrased and never thinking it would hold it did. Unfortuantly one died and me and the other hung out for another 3-4 yrs I finaly did take his advise and got off the methadone but it was tough but he told me that as of right at that minute he said I probably felt like using again (heroin) but promised him I would not Of course how man junkies d,I know many it helped when they had good paying jobs but overall it is like a prison_ it you want to go away with your lady and or kids you have to get a positive run out and then you can take your take homes.

My dr started me on 20mgs for 5 days then 15 for 5 days_then 12.5 and so on until i was taking 2.5 1/2 tablet a day. But the pain was so bad he put me back on 10 mgs a day_ thats where i was most comfortable and mangaged the pain pretty good. Just only one problem_ can't sleep. Insomnia. But i'd rather go thru that. When i was on oxycontin i wouldn't be able to take care of my kids_ would miss school functions_late for work alll the time. Stayed in bed for weeks cause my script would run out to soon_ because had to take much more. But now i take the methadone like prescribed and IT WORKS!!!!!

It made me very stable in the way that I could study all week_ workout at the gym and work all weekend but would need 12-13 hours sleep per night and if I didnt have it felt physically quite sick and headaches. I reduced my dose 2-3mg per week and felt fine and was very commited to quitting the then got down to about 5mg and it just hit me like a sledgehammer. I went from being very happy and positive to being diagnosed with major depression and panic attacks within two weeks :( I sad round almost catatonic for five months (totally clean)felling like I still had most of the withdrawl symptoms_ tried about 5 antidepressants which did NOTHING and then the doctor reluctantly put me back on 10mg methadone and within 2 days I was 100 percent better :) After a few more years on it I did a rapid detox off 50mg and was 100% after a few weeks_ just suffered fatigue and some muscle cramps but was very tollerable. So looking back on it all methadone supported very me well(despite these complaints) through 10 years_ BUT I don't uderestimate it's power. ps still clean!!! 8),M,32,10  years,5/7/2005Email,Methadone hydrochloride
169, 3, chronic pain_ painkiller addiction,weight gain (about 20 lbs)_ headaches_ dizziness_ constipation_ nightmares_ insomnia,This medication was prescribed to me because I have had chronic pain in my knees and back for about three years. I have been to about 15 specialists and physicians_ I have had every test done that is currently avaialable_ and I have tried every method under the sun to eleviate my pain without the use of narcotics_ to no avail. I have tried physical therepy_ accupuncture_ and just about every homeopathic remedy I could find on the internet_ as well as everything every doctor has ever asked of me. They can find no substantail physical causes of my pain_ yet everyday my pain level is about a 7_ with flare-ups three to four times a week (that last all day) of a level 9-10. I have lost my job_ apartment_ had my car repossessed_ my friends stopped talking to me because they all thought I was just looking to get high. No one in my family believes me_ which is the absolute worst. Everywhere I go_ people think I am a drug addict_ which I am now due to the length of time I have been on narcotics. I started on hydrocodone_ then oxycodone_ then Duragesic (all the way up to 150 micro per hour). I went of that cold turkey because I was tired of living in a drug-induced haze. I then started the cycle all over again_ and now I take 10 mg 3 x day. I want to get off it now_ I am starting to believe that the narcs are what is causing my pain to be so substantial. Long-time effects of narc use cause hyper-sensitivity to pain. Maybe whatever problem I had in the beggining is gone_ and the reason I am still in so much pain is just because of the addiction to painkillers. Does anyone have any suggestion for getting completely off these meds? Please email me if you have any ideas,F,27,6  months,2/22/2005Email,Methadone hydrochloride

It worked great the first 3-4 weeks_ but after I got a job and had to dose at 6 AM it all went downhill.  It doesn't last all day.,I entered a clinic because I could not find a doctor to help me with excruciating back pain.  BIGGEST problem is I need to split dose (for pain and to avoid withdrawal in the PM) and the clinic won't let me.  I am miserable.  I could sleep 24 hours a day_ but if I decrease my dose I have withdrawal and pain.  I know if I could take 3X day it would work well for me_ EXCEPT for weight gain!

178, 5, Severe abdominal pain (neuropathic),During the first 3 weeks I was extremely tired_ very nauseous_ confused and frustrated. Now in my 4th week_ still experiencing being tired at times.,I went from Oxycontin 20MG to 30MG to 40MG to 60MG daily_ then to Duragesic 50MCG/72 hours_ then to Duragesic 50MCG/48hrs and then back to Oxycontin 40MG daily_ plus using Tylox 5/500MG for breakthrough pain PRN since I started on these narcotics in August_ 2002. My pain wasn't contained and daily living was very hard_ no actually it was pure hell. My pain was mostly at 8 to 10 often with flair-ups that were impossible to live with. I was blowing through higher and higher amounts of narcotics all without pain relief.  My doctor then prescribed Methadone 10MG every 8 hours. The first 3 weeks were tough with side effects but now (4th week) I am experiencing some pain relief and enjoying a better quality of life. The big difference I notice using Methadone is pain is contained at a more even level. While on Oxycontin and Duragesic my pain would fluctuate from high-medium to high. Methadone keeps it at a steady medium with fewer flair-ups although I am still dealing with being tired at times.  Methadone has certainly been a life saver for me as my doctors tell me I must learn to live with this pain as surgery isn't an option for me nor are there any other forms of medical relief for my situation.  I would strongly urge anyone living with chronic pain to consider using Methadone. For me_ it is superior to Oxycontin and Duragesic.,M,55,25  days,9/18/2004,Methadone hydrochloride

Loss of appetite made me eat better when I did eat. Sleepiness can be solved with dosage times,I have been on everything. I have read all of the reponses of this page and see that addiction problems seem to be the ones that don't like this drug.  But for severe pain and what the options are: Hard to get opiates_ expense_etc. this drug has solved most of my problems. Is it perfect? NO_ nothing is. I do agree that the most bothersome thing is that a high functioning person is slowed down on methadone. It seems to take longer to get tasks done. OH WELL!!!What all you people seem to say is that you too have been on everything and for the most part_ for pain_ this seems to work. If you look for one drug to relieve all your symptoms_ there are none.  I take Paxil with methadone and I am going to look into the intereactions with antidepressants.  If you are looking for that oxycontin high_ you won't get it from methadone. I don't know whether I would say it gave me my life back but_ I do know that in the USA_ DR's have lost alot of freedom in prescribing. PERIOD.

213, 4, Chronic pain from fms and lupus sle,This is an addendum after reading from William's experience. I too have had less interest in sex (libido). Also_ for the first 5 mos. I dealt with continual constipation. I did not menstruate for a year. I was up to 120 mg. before I made the decision to stop taking this medication. Methadone is a commitment-if you have any trouble with titration (doasage) you MUST keep your doctor informed as methadone tolerance occurs over a period of time and dosage must be readjusted accordingly.,,F,43,16  months,3/11/2003Email,Methadone hydrochloride

218, 3, Heroin Addiction,"What I would say is_ don't take it unless it's really necessary.It has brought me alot of problems_ physically  but it did help me out of a horrible time_ brought me back into reality quite a bit and I was able to get my life back in order_ for the most part. The constipation is the absolute worst for me_ there is a post on here stating that ""get ready to give birth_ so to speak""  that is the complete truth!!  I also lost alot of weight when I joined my clinic almost 35lbs and was only 110 when I went in_ it was pretty scary. I have been there for a little over a year now and I just started gaining my weight back a month or two ago. Some people I talk to there have the opposite problem as I do_ but either way you are pretty much going to severely gain or lose. I think if I had a choice I probably wouldn't do it again.",,F,28,9  years,1/26/2003Email,Methadone hydrochloride
219, 4, Chronic Pain,Minimal amounts of skin itching_ moderate constipation and mild anxiety (sleep difficulties),"I am taking this drug for chronic pain resulting from an accident I sustained two+ years ago involving spinal compression fractures and a host of other seriously painfull conditions.  I had taken Oxycontin (as prescribed) in the beginning for eight months which was grossly over-prescribed by my Orthopedic Surgeon and finally put me in the hospital with severe withdrawl symptoms and sincere hopes for a quick demise.  (Withdrawl from Oxycontin is like being drug naked by a mule team through death valley!  Great pain releiver - dangerous medication)  Tried every pain reliever imagineable for just enough pain relief to be borderline functional with little success.  I have read all that I can find on the negative side-effects of Methadone.  I am now up to 10mg X 4 daily and think that I am finally on the right path.  Pain levels are down to a +/- 5 on the richtor scale and I am finally breathing sighs of relief.  This drug MUST BE taken strictly on time and over the ""24 hour clock"" (as close as possible) for me: 7:00am_ 12noon_ 5:00pm and at bedtime-+/- 11:00pm.  Start off super slow with dosages: 5mg X 3 daily for 1 week_ 5mg X 4 daily for 1 week_ 5mg X 5 daily for 1 week_ progress to 10mg X 3 daily for 1 week_ etc._ etc. until you get to where you need to be.  Methadone apparently has a somewhat unpredictable (everybodys biochemically a little different) RESIDUAL EFFECT and to get to where you need to be (not want to be!) takes time but will pay off in the long run.  BE SMART!  Pain management for most of us is ""forever"".  Dreams of ""no pain"" or levels of ""1"" or ""2"" are unrealistic.  We must learn to be tough_ realistic_ think in moderate terms and bite the bullet and hold in there for the long run so this crap we take for pain will keep effectively working and hopefully not kill us!",M,49,4  days,1/21/2003Email,Methadone hydrochloride

221, 5, Pain mgmt [ Addiction],Somnolescense_ pinpoint pupils [miosis] itching_ constipation_ and excessive sweating_ reduced libidinal urge.,After taking narcotics for over twenty years and no longer achiveing adequate relief from arthritic back pain_ I decided to enroll in the local Methadone Clinic. It afforded me pain relief for up to twenty four hours. I am currently taking Roxicodone [oxycodone hcl ]5mg four times daily_ and it is nowhere near as effective in relieving pain on a continous basis as the Methadone was. Even after five years of daily dosing_ I never found it necessary to exceed 100mg. Unlike morphine_ I have never heard of anyone taking more than 200mg. total daily intake of Methadone. It accumulates in the body and causes dose related respiratory depression for up to 48 hours in a non tolerant individual. It is an excellant narcotic for use in those suffering chronic intractible pain. Twice daily dosing is another feature that I found more convient than the usual PRN of every four to six hours.  Thanks for the time.  Respectfully: William,M,48,5  years,1/2/2003Email,Methadone hydrochloride

223, 4, Opiate Addiction_,Weight gain that began after I was on methadone 6 mos.  I am on a very high does_ 130 mgs a day.I have gained 40 lbs.  The constipation is the worst part for me. It is terrible.  I have to eat excessive amounts of high fiber foods.,I got on methadone after a 8 year addiction to opiates_ and 3 trips to prison.  I commited prescription fraud over and over to get the stuff. After losing my children_ my home_ my everything_ I ran to the methadone clinic.  Now I have a life_ I have things_ and I keep my things. It saved my life. But like one person said_ it has its bad points.  I am fat now_ never have been over weight in my life_ even before i got on drugs_ I was not fat. It slows down your metabolism I guess.  The constipation is bad too. For you women out there who have just got on methadone.  If you don't eat high fiber foods_ get ready to give birth so to speak. For the males_ get ready to find out what giving birth is all about. Also_ at first you feel like a new person_ but after you have been on it for a while_ you will find yourself slacking_ or neglecting important things in your life. I like to isolate myself_ stay at home.  Methadone is not meant to take like a daily vitamin_ everyday for the rest of your life_ after you get your life together_ and fixed all the things you broke while on drugs_ after you get stable_ normal_ start thinking about slowly detoxing.  If your a fugitive from the law_ I recommend getting off the methadone before your caught and go to jail_ because jails and correction facilities hate methadone_ and they will only give it to you for about a week.Like somebody else said_ it takes months to kick methadone. I went to prison after being on it for a year_ and I thought I would lose my mind. I could not sleep_ i was so perinoid_ I was a complete wreck_ mess.,M,40,18  months,11/21/2002,Methadone hydrochloride
224, 5, innerstitial cystitis pain,i had a small amount of itching at first. i have been soooo happy with this drug. i had to jump through my doctors hoops for 2 long painful years before my physician prescribed methadone. its like i am a new person. i can work and play again. i can have sex with the love of my life again. i am available to my children. my life has changed so much and i will forever be thankful to the german people for inventing the stuff!!!!!,it works. i take 60mg daily divided into 3 doses. after taking vicodin for years and NOT getting relief was terrible.all the tylenol in each dose was killing my liver. i was feeling sick all the time becuase i had to double the amount of hydrocodone (25-30 mgevery 2-4 hours)that was prescribed. i dont feel that i have to take more than prescribed of the methadone. it feel so good to only take 6 pills a day and i dont get nausaus as much as i used to. why doctors mainly use this drug for heroin withdrawel is beyond me!!!!!! it is by far the best pain killer i have ever taken.

231, 5, ,Be very careful using this drug_ the detox is months_ not days and is horrendous.  Morphine is a better pain reliever_ however you must keep increasing the dosage to relieve the pain.   Everyone I know who is on methadone eventually has a change in metabolism and gains weight. Long term use also leads to noding off in the daytime_ and a lack of REM sleep at night.  In some ways I wish I had never got on it_ but in other ways its a life saver.  As with every thing else in life it has 2sides,,M,,30  years,8/22/2002,Methadone hydrochloride

233, 5, Pain relief_ sciatic condition,I highly recommend this drug to all chronic pain sufferers. Drowsiness [dose reduction may alleviate this]_ dry mouth_ early on euphoria_ and dysphoria which lessened with time. Most effective pain reliever I have ever encountered. I suffer from arthritis in mid and lower back and during therapy I was for  once able to function normally. These medications give pain sufferers their lives back again_ or at least make it tolerable. The main drawback is respiratory depression_ as well as addiction_ and seldom addiction_ though the latter is uncommon if taken for pain relief.,For continual pain relief my opinion is that is is much more effective than the opiate [morphine based] analgesics_ at small er and less frequent dosing schedules. Perhaps Duragesic patches_ or Levo-Dromoran would be as effective_ though I have never been prescribed these meds. Kadian [morphine encapsulated in a plastic matrix may offer an alternative_ because of it's 12_ or 24 hr.  dosing regimen_ yet it is still an opiate_ whereas dolophine[Methdone] is synthetic. LAMM_ Levo Alpha Acet Methadol is similar to Methadone_ yet it is currently only approved for narcotic detoxification_and or maintainance as far as I know.,M,47,5  years,8/10/2002,Methadone hydrochloride
234, 5, FBS severe chronic pain,When taken at the dose the doctor advised_ I nodded off all the time_ but pain management was the best of anything I have used. (MsContin_ Oxy_ etc.)Reducing dosage and spacing it out_ I have no drowiness and pain management is still good. It is a balancing act between pain and drowsiness.,There is NO buzz with this stuff. It is not to be taken lightly - getting off is a very difficult and protracted. In my case there is no choice - it provides the best (only) pain relief and it is very inexpensive. DON'T drink alcohol.,M,,120  days,7/23/2002,Methadone hydrochloride

241, 5, Cancer,"Same basics as with most narcotics. Dry mouth_ ""burning"" of eyes BUT not as much as the Morphine nor the Oxycotin I have used. The downside effect was having to be forced to go to a drug abuse clinic and claim I was a junkie to get this and the better med I list below since my Md's did not approve of my use of these meds. They prefered the Morphine and the Oxycotin use.","This was a help however_ after you go thru the dulldrum of the drug clinics and_ as long as you are more then 100% commited_ ask about LAMM or Orlamm. This drug is wonderful. While yes_ I have been addicted to the morphine_ is was not anabuse situation as many are. I did however find that Orlamm or Lamm worked best for me but_ it comes with some risk. If you are looking for a high_ pass on Lamm. If you like to drink beer or the likes_ pass on Lamm. If you consider taking ANY type of narcotic_ pass on Lamm for it can kill you with the effect being a massive overdose. This however posed no risk to me for #1 I don't drink. #2 I was not looking to get high-just out of pain. #3 my center know the two sides of me. the first being the ""junkie"" the second_ being the cancer patient. BTW addiction centers are not to treat you for true PAIN_ just as MD's are not to treat you for addictions. Sort of sad really when the system FORCES one to lie huh? Anyway. With Lamm_ I was amazed. I took my dosage_ three times per week is all that is needed (you can go longer_ one time I was not able to get to a center for a week and had NO Pain nor withdraw!_ 9 days into this I started to feel pain) Anyway_ Lamm gave e my life back. NO high effects AT ALL.NO burning eyes_ no dry mouth_ no non stop talking. It was a prayer. I first used the methadone but_ that did give me a high effect it worked great but_ the daily dosages and such were problematic for me. Lamm was by far the choice for me. At present I am a dead man whom happens to be living four years after over 8 MD's told meI would be dead. I no longer feel any pain which I cannot deal with. At times I do get some sharp pain but_ only for a moment or two and_ NO drug can stop that. I am pleased to report I have my medicine cab. filled with ten bottles of my Morphine 15 MG and tons of bottles of Oxycotin which I have no use for.
