0, 4, Endometriosis / Infertility,Hot flashes - Only lasted for about a minute but often had multiple per day. They were bearable. Occasional headaches in days following each injection. Gained approximately 15 pounds over the 6 months. Had some sleeplessness in the first months but that went away around month 3. Minor forgetfulness.,I didn't mind being on Lupron. Some forums scared me but I did it anyway. The injections were once a month and the month following the first injection I had absolutely no cycle_ not even spotting. That was nice. It seems to have cleared up the endo from my lack of pain. Doc also did an HSG (hysterosalpingogram) and my tubes and uterus looked clear. Not sure if it has repaired the fertility issue yet but the side effects were bearable in comparison to the pain I was in from my endo and cyst that had formed.,F,29,6  months30MG 1X M,5/27/2016Email,Lupron depot

(Quit at 4.5 months.)  Apparently fabricated into a clinical trial (according to Health Canada's 1999 report of the drug's accessibility then). I was not ill nor complaining of any symptoms_ but only wanted information about IVF prior to extended travels about to deliver me_ months later_ to country life 3000 miles away. The physician worked hard over the course of an hour to persuade us...........In 1997_ I was told_ yet again_ that I needed surgery for mysterious sumptoms_ again run amok in my body. I ended up typing ""Luperon"" into a computer for the first time. To my shock_ up popped the ""National Lupron Victims Network"" (NLVN) being_ then_ my very first source of authentic information about Lupron. I became an anti-Lupron activist_ then the only one in Canada_ until the powers that be made that unsafe and I vanished from sight to protect my loved ones and myself_ 2000-2016_ as did NLVN Founder Linda Abend_ DDS_ (vanishing a few weeks after I did)......

2, 1, fibroids,I took Lupron only once and it completely destroyed my abdominal wall.  The injury is irreversible and not covered by insurance_ but I have had two major surgeries at my own expense to get some improvement.  Lupron doesn't cure any condition or illness and there are victims groups all over the internet.  This drug should never be prescribed.,Be advised that Lupron is NOT FDA approved for fertility treatments and completely unnecessary.  It increases the dangers and drives up the costs.,F,48,1  months3.75 1X M,11/26/2012Email,Lupron depot
