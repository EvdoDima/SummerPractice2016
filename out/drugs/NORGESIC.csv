1, 5, Migraine,Can cause terrible nausea/stomach pain if I don't take with Vistaril_ and on a full stomach.,My neurologist prescribed Norgesic for me to use in combination with Vistaril as a back up abortive for migraine (ie_ if I've already used the maximum number of doses of the Triptans and the migraine still comes back). I find it is just as effective as the Triptans in relieving my migraine head and neck pain_ and when taken with the Vistaril_ the nausea of migraine goes away too. I don't need to use it very often_ but it is a godsend to have this effective backup when I do need it.,F,46,10  months,5/16/2009,Norgesic
2, 5, neck pain and severe headaches,none,My headaches were so bad they brought me to tears. No over the counter drug touched them. If I take norgesic when I first feel one of these headache coming on_ it totally knocks it out before it gets started. I don't take this drug often_ but it is amazing when I need it.,F,62,4  years,4/20/2009,Norgesic

4, 1, headache,Became so weak I thought I was dying.,I nearly died from this drug when I was younger. My heart began racing out of control_ while at the same time_ I became so weak I had to sit down. I collapsed forward on the table while sitting. My arms and legs felt like lead; I could barely move them. I thought I was dying_ but came out of it some time later. I never took it again.,F,63,1  days,4/22/2007,Norgesic
