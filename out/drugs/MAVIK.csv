4, 3, High blood pressure,Mild fatigue_ headaches at exactly 3:00 pm each day (I take the drug @ 9:00 am)_ increased mucus in the throat_ especially at night when lying down or trying to sleep. This is very bothersome as it causes tickling and makes it hard to fall asleep. This is probably the most bothersome side effect. It will wake me up and I feel like I have a golf size ball of mucus in my throat. It has also caused my stools to be much looser than normal.,The drug did control my HBP bringing it to the 120/80 range.,F,49,3  months2 mg 1X D,8/29/2014Email,Mavik

I self-medicated and increased doseage to 4mg for two weeks but it didn't bring the numbers down any further. Yesterday_ doctor prescribed a water pill in hopes of increasing Mavik's effectiveness.,F,45,1.5  years2mg 1X D,4/17/2013,Mavik

14, 2, High blood pressure,The cough drives me nuts. Absolutely no sex drive and I'm tired all the time,It seems to be keeping my blood pressure at 140/85_ which still isn't good enough. I'm going to talk to my doctor about switching drugs. I've been on mavik 2 mg for 10 months since I had a cecerian section and lost a lot of blood.,F,26,10  months,6/23/2005Email,Mavik
15, 2, HBP & kidney protection (diabetes),1 and 1/2 months after starting Mavik (2 mg./day)_ I developed a dry (nonproductive) cough that is particularly irksome at night. This is coupled with an always runny that doesnÂ’t respond to any allergy medication.  Now at 5 months on Mavik and these symptoms are worse.,Mavik is completely effective at controlling my HPB at 2 mg./day.  None of the terrible side effects I experienced on the Beta-blocker Metoprolol (fatigue_ lethargy_ depression_ weight gain).  I have sleep apnea however_ and it's tough enough already to get a good night's sleep without coughing all night.  If you don't have the runny nose and cough_ or it's tolerable_ Mavik works well.  I'm on to an ARB next to see if that works for me - Benicar (olmesartan).,M,44,5  months,9/20/2004,Mavik

17, 3, hypertension,Persistent cough worse at night_ upper respiratory mucous and tickling_ increased loss of libido_ increased fatigue. Not sure how much is attributable to Mavik_ but doctor switched me to Avapro after seven months because of complaints about upper chest and persistent coughing and fatigue.,Mavik appeared to control my BP by end of day_ but morning BP readings were still higher. Probably because I was started on minimum dosage_ but after seven months did not want to increase on this drug because of cough that would not go away_ plus occasional acute fatigue & drowsiness.,M,56,7  months,9/7/2004,Mavik

19, 2, Hypertension,At 2mg no side effects_ but when I needed to increase the dose to 4mg_ my libido dropped to zero. My doctor didn't tell me this could happen. I don't think doctors think this is important to women.,I also take Maxzide to control my blood pressure. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and diuretic work_ but I don't consider Mavik a good choice for me.,F,57,2  years,4/18/2004,Mavik
