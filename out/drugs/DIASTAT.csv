0, 5, epilepsy,drowsiness after I wake up_feel kinda queezy and have to go to the bathroom after I wake up.Feel sluggish for a few hours.,Diastat is the fastest working AED I have ever taken_ even though it is rectally applied. Diastat can stop a seizure as quick as 5 to 10 minutes_my results. it just depends on how quick you or someone else can administer the plastic tiped applicator and give you the shot. The seizure just fades away and in my case puts me to sleep.,M,40,3  days,9/11/2007Email,Diastat
