5, 3, Proteinuria,Back pain_ stomach upset_ diarrhea_ lightheaded,I actually never had hypertension. The highest my BP would get is in the 130's. I'm taking this because I have urine in my protein_ and ARB's have been known to reduce proteinuria and slow down the progression on kidney diease. I started at 20 mg_ and moved up to 40 mg since the higher dose would have a more dramatic effect on reducing the proteinuria. I'm tolerating the side effects for now_ until I can see if it has a significant effect on the proteinuria,M,52,1  months40 mg 1X D,10/17/2015Email,Micardis

7, 3, Hypertension caused by kidney disease,Tired and dizzy for first few months but effective in lowering blood pressure from 148/98 to as low as 89/70. Dizzyness went away but i learned to live with no energy and tiredness. Thought it was age /kidney disease related.  Made lifestyle changes and dropped Micardis from 80mg day to 20 mg day but still exhausted. BP maintained on 20mg Micardis at 118/79.  Over 4+ years of micardis i developed insomnia_ muscle and joint pain at night_ headaches back pain and eventually major depression. Had no idea Micardis was the problem until I finally convinced nephrologist to try change BP medication due to developing tinnitus.  Now 45 days later i feel better than i have in years.  Have more energy_ sleep better_ and havent felt muscle and joint pain at night in 2 weeks. Tinnitus is still a problem but not as loud. Depression symptoms even seem better.  BP is 120/80 on new meds. If you are having problems similar to my own-dont wait!  Talk to doctor and try changing to another BP medicine without negative side effects.,,F,49,4  years80mg down to 20mg,4/19/2014,Micardis
8, 2, Hypertension,Major - over time developed joint and muscle pains which culminated_ during the last 5 weeks when the dose was increased from 40mg to 80mg_ to actual ligament and cartilage damage in my hip (hip labral tear) and knees.  Terrible pain and disability!  Not sure if the drug caused the damage or predisposed me to it. Secondly_ I have had chronic reflux and nausea with no known cause after tests.  I have been chroncially tired_ feel ancient_ blurred vision at times_ and several hours after taking the medication am regularly woken by a horrible feeling of being hit in the back and head heaviness.I was previoulsy on Atacand (from the same class of drugs but slightly different) which caused joint aches and problems (knee aches and knees prone to minor injury).  The aches went away within days of stopping the medication but the knees have remained stiff to this day.  Micardis over time has insidiously caused similar problems but much worse. Prior to taking atacand or micardis I did no,Micardis did control my blood pressure for quite a long while but it has been at a terrible cost in terms of causing other insidiously increasing problems.   The dose of Micardis was only increased to 80mg five weeks ago (from 40mg) because my BP was increasing and then in the final week of taking the 80mg my blood pressure was going high at night_ the control was lost and I felt very very ill.  Muscle aches_ acute hip pain_ mental confusion and fogginess and awful  nausea.  It was now poison and my body was saying no more!,F,65,2  years40mg_ 80mg 1X D,4/19/2014,Micardis

17, 3, High Blood Pressure,I took Micardis before with little side effects or so I thought. Since going back on the drug noticed side effects that were present before but never thought they were because of the drug. Side effects this time around include: Sinus Pressure (constant)_ Palpitations after consuming alcohol_ joint pain_ muscle pain_ quite severe episodes of anxiety_ mild depression_ constant dizziness_ bloating_ episodes of blurred vision and fatigue.I am hoping these subside in the next week or I will be making an appointment to see my GP.,Has definitely brought my BP down form 140-150\95-90 to 110-120\75-85 but if the side effects don't subside_ I may have to look at something different.,M,38,3  weeks40 1X D,7/25/2013Email,Micardis

20, 2, High Blood Pressure,BRILLIANTLY reduced my blood pressure (160/100) to normal for my age (125/75) with no side effects except for_ how can I put this - it produced INCREDIBLE FLATULENCE.   Not to put too fine a point on it_ I became a (putrid!) farting MACHINE (which I hadn't been previously).   While it didn't produce diarrhea_ the stools were darker and ribbon-like.  When I complained to the manufacturer_ I was told that magnesium_ which can cause flatulence_ is added to assist in assimilation.  The worst part was that they indicated they were going to take no action because they'd only had 2 previous reports of flatulence.  Another assimilation drug is needed_ please!  I can't believe my experience is unique.,On paper_ this drug is supposed to have the fewest side effects of all of them!  Don't know what to do now.,M,50,4  months40 mg 1X D,7/4/2013Email,Micardis

Tinnitus - strong hissing all the time.   Anxiety - even after discontinuing.,Had tried Atacand for hypertension_ but it caused inability to read - fuzzy brain - strange words would pop out of my mouth during conversations.  This all cleared up when I stopped taking Atacand.   Then - 80mg Micardis for 10 days unbearable - no sleep_ couldn't eat_ anxious all the time_ loud tinnitus.  Had always had tinnitus_ but not this loud.  Never an anxious person.  Digestion never a problem before this either.     I would NOT recommend this.    I envy those it does help.

35, 1, mild hypertension,Both myself and wife are PHYSICIANS and on this drug upon recommendation of colleague_ who thinks it is great.  Maybe he has been infulenced by reassurances about the safety and low side effect profile of this drug_ which we are having an increasingly hard time believing.  Listed in order of frequency and severity:  muscle cramps_ from annoying persistent to extremely painful electric incapacitating and seemingly associated most strongly with fluid balance/changes/sweating; dizziness (checked in ER thinking I had a stroke!); tinnitis/dysphoria/asthenia: skin changes/thinning/hair loss.  Of course_ we ourselves were patronistically reassured that these sides were not from the Rx but just from getting old!   It takes even longer for us to doubt a physician_ especially a friend.,For us_ these side effects could no longer be tolerated for the sake of the modest improvement in blood pressure obtained.  We have had a very hard time getting our experiences posted on the internet_ and wonder if others with bad reports on various Rxs have seen the same.  Certainly these side effects were real and due to the medication_ and there may have been others less prominent for us but more serious for others.  Just amazing how easily we were duped into believing that these symptoms were not from the Rx_ and we were the only ones who had them.Hopefully_ others might make the connection sooner than us.  We've never had any patients with cramps as severe as we have endured!,M,60,2  years40mg 1X D,6/25/2012,Micardis

Intense pain in my upper central back last 2 weeks however I think it is unrelated to Micardis?,I was a fit ex professional tennis player on the seniors tour who completely gave all exercise away for 2 years due to injury. I then presented with BP 165/98 following a diagnosed eye retina haemorrhage.I was put immediately on micardis 20mg daily which reduced bp only to average 135-140/88 so after 3 weeks increased to 40mg daily. BP immediately went down to average 120/80. 3 months on_ I have no side effects that Im aware of. Commenced going to gym again_became a vegetarian and I have never felt physically better. Yes_ I feel anxious and often stressed however that is me_ and possibly the reason why I got hypertension...so i'm not going to blame Micardis for that.My advice for those on micardis_ change your lifestyle_ exercise more_ eat more vegetables & less fatty foods_ reduce cholesterol and hopefully improve your cadiovascular system.If we had all done that to start with_ none of us would have had to be on Micardis.,M,57,4  months40 MG 1X D,3/18/2012,Micardis

50, 4, hypertension,There are some side effects_ but not as bad as other possible meds for hypertension: ringing in ears( tinnitus?) becomes noticeable in quiet times_ was more prevalent at the higher(80mg) dose than at my current 40 mg dosecombined with the diuretic. Also had a kind of muscle twitching I noticed at the higher dose. Now I have it combined with 12.5 mg HCT; I split the medications_ taking miardis in the AM and the diuretic in the PM. Seems to be an effective combination.,Been 5 years on Micardis. Initially was on a diuretic HCT 12.5 mg  alone for 1 year but started having had muscle cramping. Then combined it with Micardis and for awhile used Micardis at 40_ 60 or 80 mg alone.Micardis seems to be one of the better alternatives_ but am not sure how effective for hypertension it is alone; think it is most effective combining it with another class_ such as a diuretic. Also_ I found splitting the 2 medications into morning and evening works best. Also seems to counteract  the possible muscle cramping with a diuretic alone_ there may be a scientific reason for this dealing with potassium.,M,52,5  years40mg 1X D,4/15/2011Email,Micardis

58, 1, hypertension,hair loss and  foot and ankle spasms at night.,Micardis did a wonderful job of reducing my b/p along with Cardizem 360 and Tekturna 150. I was having terrible night foot and ankle spasms and I stopped Micardis on my own. Went back to my doctor and he told me it was not from Micardis but from my Lipitor. I reminded him I had stopped it previously and the spasms stopped. He insisted I stop my Lipitor for 1 month and the spasms/cramps would stop. I stopped the Lipitor and went back on Micardis and the spasms returned. My doctor refuses to believe my discomfort_ which awakens me several times a night_ is from the Micardis. I am changing docotors and hoping that the new doctor will understand,F,60,5  years80 1X D,10/28/2010,Micardis
