I couldn't breathe and my legs and hands went numb.  My boss called an ambulance and they rushed me to a nearby hospital.  The entire time I thought I was going to die.  It took me about 30-45 minutes to calm down.  They couldn't find out what was wrong with me after blood work and CT scans(I think it could've been a panic attack) but after that I still haven't felt right.  3rd Day: I tried to call my Dr. (although it was a weekend so it was a nurse on call) and I had to do the run around from them to the ER to the pharmacist_ back to the ER where I got the antibiotics from and they told me to keep taking the antibiotics because they doubted it was a reaction.4th day: I'm still really dizzy and tired.

75, 1, UTI,Within 3 hours of taking first (and only) pill I began vomiting violently.  There was nothing to throw up but the pressure in my chest and stomach with the force of the vomiting mechanism was unbearable.  I went through this every ten minutes or so for 90 minutes.  Then I had the urge to defecate and when I did_  it was pure liquid.  It was as if someone turned on a faucet full blast.  It just kept gushing. This happened three time within 30 minutes.  I was completely exhausted and could barely get to my bed.  Once I got there I experienced the worst chills ever.  I asked my son to turn off the fan and put blankets on me but I still couldn't get warm.  This all happened 2 days ago and I'm STILL wiped out with a scratchy throat and sore muscles.

I was in hospital for two weeks and only after a year and a half have I recovered completly.  The doctor said only 1% have this reaction but who wants to be the 1%?,Would not advise anyone to take this med.,F,74,3  days,1/2/2005Email,Cephalexin
141, 4, Sinus Infection,Some stomach side effects_ no bad_ mainly cramps,This is the second time I take it for sinus infections... It's ok.,F,28,14  days,10/5/2004,Cephalexin
142, 3, Strep Throat,Could not tell if I was having problems due to strep throat_ or the med (night sweats_ racing heart_ panic attacks).  Unsure...,It cured my 6 week old case of strep throat after Levaquin_ Zithromax and Erithromycin failed.  Read somewhere that Strep is not resistant to Penicilin (which I am allergic to)_ but can do something with enzymes to make it less effective.  This drug combines the effectivness of Penicilin and is not impacted by the enzyme thing (so it said...).  Be careful_ there is a 20-30 percent chance that you will react to this if allergic to penicilin.  For me_ it was worth the risk.,M,39,10  days,8/5/2004,Cephalexin
