0, 1, Contraception,I went in to have an IUD put in and doc told me she wouldn't do it unless I took the pill for 1 month first.  I told her I couldn't because I was 35 years old and I knew the risk of blood clot is higher with age.  We went back and forth and she kept assuring me that taking it would not harm me.  So reluctantly I took it.  Well after taking it for 3 weeks I developed a Pulmomary Embolism (blood clot in lungs) and a Deep Vein Thrombosis (blood clot in my main vein in my leg).  I almost dyed.  Rushed to hospital.  Doctors said I was lucky to be alive.  This drug is dangerous and I would not recommend it to anyone!!,,F,39,30  days 1X D,6/19/2012Email,Triphasil-21
