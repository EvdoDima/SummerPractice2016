1, 4, Pregnancy complications,Skin irritation,Based on reading the majority of the reviews_ I've never experienced any blurry vision_ dry mouth_ etc. Sorry it didn't work out for the others_ but for me it's a miracle. Im diagnosed with HG_ a severe case in a pregnancy_ and out of the 8 medications that I was taking daily_ The patch seemed to work the most. I discontinued the 7 medications and stuck with the patch. However_ I did have one problem..Since Ive been using this for about 6 months now_ my skin behind my ears are very irritated. Looks like someone burned me. It did feel like a burning sensation everytime I put a new one on_ but it's just a side effect_ Its embarrassing to have my hair up_ people tend to think I have a bad skin rash/infection. The color of the skin behind my ear is a reddish-purpleish. I did take it off once to see how it goes_ and I ended up being back in the hospital_ severely vomiting and vomiting up blood. As much as my skin itches a lot and burns_ I just cant take it off. Its a nightmare everytime I take a trip to the ER. HG is the worst to have during pregnancies.,F,20,6  months10 mg 2X W,7/31/2016,Transderm scop
2, 1, Travel,Wore when traveling to Africa.  Had to keep on pretty much the whole trip because of motion sickness.  Returned home and took the patch off as soon as we landed.  With 24 hours was horrendously sick.  Fatigue_ nausea_ light headed_ anxiety_ super depressed_ depersonalization_ and looking/acting completely drugged.  For 4 days couldn't pull myself off the couch or out of bed.  Day 5 started to see slight improvement with using Dramamine_ zofran_ and Ativan.  Still have a long ways to go to get back to my normal!,,F,35,10  days,7/11/2016Email,Transderm scop
3, 1, Post surgical nausea,Dry mouth blurred vision headache dizzy PVCS itching dilated eyes.,After removing patch worn for 3 days post op had terrible headache nausea Pvcs dilated pupils equilibrium was off dizzy still having issues after 4th day.  Terrible drug!,F,50,3  days,5/31/2016,Transderm scop
4, 2, Post-op nausea and vomiting,Long history of post-op nausea (PONV) here. Excellent care team applied patch about an hour before surgery (along with IV Zofran) to stop the nausea. Really hoped it would help. The dizziness & blurred vision & very dry mouth made me feel worse--dying of thirst. Drank too fast post-op and had some of the worst PONV ever. CRNA said to wear it 3 days; I took it off after about 36 hours; my doctor switched me from oral promethazine (did not stay down) to meltable Zofran_ which was much better. Hope it works better for others.,,F,50,2  days1 mg patch 1X W,5/18/2016Email,Transderm scop

7, 5, Multiple sclerosis symptoms,No side effects were more noticeable then my MS symptoms in general. It helps every day with my constant vertigo_ dizziness_ and my nausea. If the patch stops working after 3 days I need to put on another because my symptoms come back in full force and its unbearable. I have a hard time leaving the house without one that is actively helping to control my symptoms,I really wish there were more studies about the long term effects of regular usage,F,20,90  days1.5mg 1X D,3/17/2016Email,Transderm scop
8, 1, Nausea during anesthesia,Ugh the patch was put on me prior to surgery so I wouldn't get sick from the anesthesia. The next morning I woke up and couldn't see anything up close. It's now 4 days later and I still can't see up close. No one told me that blurred vision was a side effect. This is awful. I had to go back to work. I will never use this again!,,F,37,1  days30,3/12/2016Email,Transderm scop
9, 1, prior to surgery to prevent nausea,Dry mouth_nausea_extreme dizziness_dialated pupils_ blurred vision_ constipation_ trouble urinating the first 24 hrs.,I was directed to put patch on evening before surgery. Upon waking (10 hrs. after applying the patch) I was extremely dizzy and very blurred vision. Couldn't read my phone_ couldn't see paperwork I was signing at the hospital.The Dr. Said I did the right thing removing it. I had all the above symptoms the first 3 days. I'm on day 4 and I'm still very dizzy at times with bouts of nausea and headaches. Im worried how long it's going to take to clear my system. I would advise no one to take this drug_ very unsafe_ I don't know how it's even allowed to be prescribed. Scary stuff!,F,44,1  days1.5 mg,2/8/2016Email,Transderm scop

11, 1, I was trying it out before a trip,I put a patch on in the evening on a Saturday. By Sunday late in the day I began to feel very dizzy.  I kept it on for about another hour or two and couldn't handle the dizzy feeling anymore and took off the patch.  The next day and a half I felt fine.  By that night though I began experiencing dizziness off and on that progressively got worse.  I also have vision issues_ confusion_ headaches_neasua_ trouble with speech_and severe ear pain.  My doctor put me on a steroid_ meclezine_ zofran_ Zyrtec.  Feeling some relieve but not all the way yet.  So this is day 4 of symptoms.  I did this for an up coming trip.  I'm trying to find out how much longer this will last,,F,43,1  days1.5 mg,12/11/2015,Transderm scop
12, 1, 8 day cruise,I used one patch every 72 hours as directed. I experienced extreme dry mouth and drank water constantly during my cruise. The patches really worked for seasickness which troubles me badly_ but from the moment I removed the last patch_ I was deathly ill.  Severe nausea and headache as well as vivid_ disturbing dreams were my reward for a nausea free cruise. The aftermath of the patches lasted longer than the 8 day cruise.  I have been fatigued_ but unable to rest soundly and once awoke to my heart flipping around in my chest like a fish out of water.  I will never request this poison again.,,F,63,8  days 1X D,10/31/2015,Transderm scop
13, 4, to prevent sea sickness,I used this patch to prevent sea sickness while going deep sea fishing and it did keep me from getting sea sick. The only side effect I've had is the eye on the side I wore the patch_ the pupil keeps dialating. The other pupil is normal. It's been one week now since I removed the patch and the one eye is still dialating. Weird!,,F,59,1  days,10/23/2015,Transderm scop
14, 1, Surgery,Should've learned my lesson the first time I used this for surgery as it made me extremely nauseous as soon as I took it off and the nausea lasted for days. I thought this was because I took it off after 24 hours and did not wait the 72 hours as I was instructed. Just had surgery last week and used it again this time following instructions and removing after 72 hours. The side effects were horrible. Headache_ dizziness and nausea also broke out in a horrible rash. Used meclizine to try and lesson the withdrawals I was experiencing. It took a few days and a few doses of activated charcoal to start feeling normal again. Still suffering with this rash though. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone! This drug is toxic and should not be approved for use!,,F,46,1  days30,10/20/2015,Transderm scop
15, 1, vertigo,Unexplainable and weird feeling.  I stayed in bed for 2 days unable to sleep.  My heart was pounding and bp got so high.  I used meclizine 25 for two days which helped.  I told my doctor about the side effects and he laugh at me.  He said the drug is non-addictive.  I can just remove it and that should be it.,I tried Transdem Scop because it works with a friend and my meclizine gets me sleepy.  I'm back with Meclizine and am glad that it helps me when I needed it.,,67,3  days,9/26/2015,Transderm scop
16, 3, Motion sickness on a cruise,It really helped to keep any motion sickness in check during the cruise_ but hours after I removed the patch I REALLY started feeling the negative side effects:  swollen ankles_ dizziness_ heart pounding_ sweating....all to the point that I was thinking about going to the ER. This is the day after I removed the patch and still feel ill due to the side effects. I won't use this medication again.,,F,53,3  days 1X D,7/31/2015,Transderm scop

When I removed the patch I could not get up for two days and after a week am experiencing severe nausea and dizziness.,I wish I would have know about the withdrawal affects after wearing the patch for so many days. I have used the patch many times before for shorter trips and did not experience the withdrawal symptoms.,F,41,10  days1.5 MG,7/28/2015Email,Transderm scop
19, 3, for a cruise,I just got back from a cruise yesterday morning. This patch worked for motion sickness however after I took it off yesterday I instantly had bad dry mouth and confusion. I had felt like I had burned my tongue eating something hot but I couldnt remember what I had eaten (a banana and orange juice) I then began to feel nauseous and was having blurred vision and double vision. I instantly started drinking tons of water thinking that it would flush it out of my system and I took a shower to really wash the area where I had the patch. I totally zoned out in the shower and knew I was there to wash the patch away but could not remember if I had washed it or not. I then laid down and tried to text my friend but I was seeing double vision again almost impossible to text. I actually fell asleep into a deep sleep for a long time. This is not common for me_ I never take naps during the day. Well today i'm on day 2 and was supposed to pick up my husband from the airport but I do not feel confident,I was prescribed to take one patch for 72 hours and then swap it out with a patch on my alternating side. I followed instructions.,F,39,  1X D,7/24/2015Email,Transderm scop

Could not control my thoughts my actions.  This is not a safe drug.  It has been 3 days since I had taken this drug off and nothing helps.  I would rather deal with a vertigo attack than these side effects.  Please do not take this drug it is very unsafe,M,30,1  days,6/30/2015,Transderm scop
22, 1, Vertigo,Extreme dry mouth_ dizziness_ extreme fear_ insomnia_ emotional_ unusual thoughts and behavior_ shaking_ anxiety. I thought I was going crazy.,Please never take this medication. Worst experience of my life. Went to the ER twice doctors in ER did not believe it was side effects of medication. They keep telling me it was the Vertigo and to keep taking the medication. Thank goodness for this website. It's been five days and still having side effects. It come in waves. Sometimes I'm fine and then all of a sudden my heart will start beating fast_ or I get nauseas_ or begin sweating. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG.,F,32,5  days1.5,6/19/2015,Transderm scop
23, 5, Motion sickness,Dry mouth_ thirst_ tiredness_ a little foggy,I've used this 5 or 6 times. Usually on a boat. I do get carsick so on a trip to Asia where we were driving to factories on dirt roads that were windy I wore one. Never felt nassaus. Had a trip 3 days ago that required me to be on a bus_ used the patch and was fine. I evern READ in the backseat of the car!  Dry mouth and tiredness are better than nausea and vomiting. Use correct dose. It's been a game changer for me.,F,44,2  days1 mg 1X W,6/11/2015,Transderm scop
24, 1, 4 day cruise,SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION. I had the patch on for about 24 hours and my hands/wrists were so swollen to about 2-3 times the size. I thought that it was because I was wearing the pressure point wrist bands_ so I ignored it. The next day I could barely swallow. I thought that I just had severe dry mouth_ a common symptom_ however I was really having an allergic reaction! I came home from the cruise_ and within 1 hour of taking off the patch_ I have severe shaking_ could not hold a glass of water. I felt like I was still on the boat with the wooziness_ but way worse. I had to hold onto objects just to walk across the room. I took an allergy pill and within the hour_ my heart palpitations began. High blood pressure_ shaking uncontrollably_ could barely stand up_ felt like I was going to pass out. I ended up in the hospital.,I am thankful that I saw this website because I also thought that I was going crazy. It is now 3 weeks after taking the patch off and I am not the same. I have the worse fatigue I have ever experienced. The first week off the patch I still felt like I was going to pass out_ also with fatigue and shaking and confusion. I would forget what I was talking about or take an extra long time to respond to an email at work. I would have these shaking light headed episodes where I would almost pass out. I ended up missing about 2-3 days of work because of this. All I could do was sleep. I also had spasms in my legs which lasted a few days. The second week was slightly better with less of the shaking light headed episodes. The fatigue was still there however. I am just trying to be patient. Week three and I can't take it. I have not been the same since. I have never experienced this fatigue feeling for this long. I am still having trouble concentrating but it's better than week 2. I am extrememly depressed_ not myself. I have actually gone back to exercising only to be let down by having to stop in the middle of it. The almost fainting episodes have stopped_ thank god. However I am not myself anymore. I really hope that it fades soon. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I really feel that if I did not go to the hospital that I would have passed out and not woke up. I really do. ,F,34,4  days 1X D,6/3/2015EmailHistory,Transderm scop
25, 5, to avoid motion sickness on cruise,During I had the patch I did not experience motion sickness or side effects  but after I took it off_ it was horrible : vomits_ upset stomach_ dizziness. I thought I had a stomach flu.  I finally recovered and could travel back to my home.  It spoiled my vacations for 4 days. DO NOT USE THIS PATCH.,,F,52,3  days30 1X D,5/5/2015,Transderm scop

27, 1, Post anesthesia/surgery,Blurred vision_ dizziness_ weakness_ memory loss_ anxiety that elevated blood pressure_ shakiness_ depression_ headaches_ vivid dreaming_ feeling like I was trapped in my own body!,I had a routine surgery that caused me to become sick after anesthesia. The nurse just put this on me and directed me not to touch it for it could cause my eyes to dilate. I was very careful not to touch it. I returned to work and after I took the patch off. I began having all above symptoms. I called my dr immediately and told me it was the patch. I missed a week of work and I prayed to God that I would recover quickly! This was a VERY SCARY experience and I thank God that I have a wonderful husband and family who helped me! I have 4 children and work a full time job. I was unable to be a mom or work! I had to rely on others to drive me and take care of my children_ while I laid in bed. I am a normally very healthy 32 year old. I do not take medication_ smoke_ or drink alcohol. I would have rather been sick all night than go through the symptoms I experienced from this patch!!!!,F,32,3  days,3/12/2015,Transderm scop
28, 1, post-surgery,About 2 hours after taking the patch off (before I knew any of the stuff on this website) my arms started to feel oddly weak. I didn't feel like I had normal control of my hands. I had blurry vision while on the patch and it got worse after I took it off.  The day I took it off I was unable to eat or drink due to severe nausea.  I was highly emotional which was very unusual for me.  I felt depressed and fatigued. I ended up getting 4 liters of fluid through IV the day after I took the patch off. 3 days after that I ended up with what is called an intractable migraine and only a trip to the ER fixed the issue. Nearly 3 weeks later I am still having vision problems but the other issues have resolved.,Stay far away from this crap.,F,35,2  days 1X O,2/26/2015Email,Transderm scop
29, 1, Seven Day Cruise,"Two and a half months after using the Transderm Scope Patch and I am back to normal!  I struggled the most with Vertigo.  My symptoms were: dry mouth_ itching around patch_ vertigo_ dizzy_ cognitive confusion_ the muscles on one side of my face (the side the patch was located on) would  tense at night when I was tired.  This would cause my face to appear lopsided.  I had loss of near vision_ extreme fatigue. ear pain_ ear popping_ and vomiting when patch was removed.  I also had gut issues and appetite issues.  Women in their mid 40s can develop vertigo (Mal de Debarquement or ""MDD"" a type of vertigo and imbalance that occurs after getting off of a boat.)  The big question_ was my body resetting itself after an allergic reaction to scopolamine in combination with MDD or was it all related to the Transderm Scope patch/scopolamine.  I believe it was all related to the patch_ so did the majority of the doctors I visited.  Either way_ I learned the actual drug is still in your sy",Drink water to flush everything out of your body.  I took Benadryl_ and think it helped a small amount.  Our cruise was very rough seas in  August 2014.  While the patch was on I did not get sick once.  Out of 10 family/friends members on the cruise who took the patch_ five had a reaction.  For you who are suffering now_ I am so sorry.  It was a long road_ but it is over now!  Im at month three and will now and work to get back into the great physical shape I was in before I had my allergic reaction. Best Wishes.,F,43,4  days 1X D,11/11/2014Email,Transderm scop

33, 1, Motion sickness on trip,I used the patch before and had no issues using it on this trip. I took off patch after plane/car ride home after 2 days with that patch on. I woke up with extreme itching thoughout my body_ then progressed to dizzy feeling. I took benadryl with no help_ got worse went to ER. Told them about trip_ mentioned patch. ER dr told me maybe bug bite or parasite from ocean. Put me on prednisone. Got worse and worse over the next 7 days (another trip to ER_ and 2 trips to walk in clinic). Dizzy_ not myself_ could not think or drive_ shaking_ and heart rate up even after an hour in doctor office. Just told me to go home and drink water_ came off prednisone given antihistamine. Dr took me off everything except antibiotic while waiting for blood work to come back. Doctors said_ have no idea what you came in contact with and did not believe it was from patch (and neither did I and that point).,"Came home in tears on day 7 from doctor as heart rate was still up and dr pretty much told me to ""calm down it will go away"". Thankfully I did not have to go back to work for 2 weeks but was getting nervous about being forced into a medical leave. I went to my computer and searched everything_ places I have been_ bugs_ ocean water....then finally this site and a few others like this! YES!!!! I found it!! I was shocked as I used the patch before but like so many before me_ it happens a lot to people who used it before. It was everything I had! I read about people doing the dramamine. I was so nervous to do it but it was over the counter and told my husband it can't hurt and had taken it before. It was like a MIRACLE. Total turn around. I took 50mg (non drowsy brand only_ reg one has a different drug). I took 25mg every 6 hrs for 12 hours (2 doses)_ then took a 24 hr 50mg dose and slept it off. No more meds_ heart rate down_ dizzy stopped. You will know when to take the next pill as you start feeling it again. If it is at night take 25mg or try to sleep it off. I am still waiting my blood work and when I go back this week_ I plan on getting my records and then telling this dr he needs to read up on this patch! I also plan on writing my hospital to inform their doctors_ did not have to go through those 7 days of extreme discomfort if they understood this withdrawals from this patch.

SEVERE flushing (like a sunburn all over). DRY MOUTH. Just complete_ complete HELL. I would take the nausea over this ANY day. The stupid anesthesiologist didn't even tell me what I got - didn't tell me to take it off if I got urinary retention. It's been a WEEK and I am still needing to use a catheter to drain my bladder. What in the hell are they thinking giving this to people without their knowledge?! POISON POISON POISON. STAY AWAY!!!!,I wore the patch for 2 days before Googling it and realizing it was SCOPOLAMINE. Look up Scopolamine on YouTube. It is a deliriant. If you care about your mind and body_ don't let them TOUCH you with this stuff.,F,23,2  days1 patch 1X D,8/5/2014Email,Transderm scop
37, 5, Prevention of Motion sickness,I used the patch to prevent motion sickness when I went to Disney World and Universal Studios.

40, 1, Preventing post-op nausea,Extreme blurry eyes_ extreme dry mouth and throat,I put this on before surgery at the recommendation of my anesthesiologist.  When I woke up from my surgery_ everything was blurry.  Five hours post-surgery I could not only not read things closely_ but also couldn't see the TV in my hospital room.  I asked the nurse if I could take off the patch_ and she said no.  Well_ by 11pm that night I was nearly blind and pulled off the patch.  For the first week after surgery_ I had severe dizziness and spins.  Meclizine helped that.  However_ my eyesight continued to be poor for 6 weeks.  I finally saw my eye Dr. and she said to wait it out.  Now_ 8 weeks post-surgery_ I feel my eyesight is back to normal.  That was a HORRIBLE experience and I only wore it for 12 hours!  I will turn it down every time in the future.  I would rather throw up a few times.  I wanted to post for those who are worrying that your eyesight will never return to normal.  It does.,F,37,1  daysone patch 1X D,5/2/2014,Transderm scop
41, 2, nausea prevention while at Disney World,I thought I was going blind.  To the point I was scheduling a follow up appointment with my lasik doctor from 8 years ago to see if I needed an additional procedure.  I couldnt read anything_ close or far_ and everything was in doubles and blurry.  When I finally remembered ears and eyes are tied into motion sickness_ I had my husband google the side affects of Transderm Scop to see blurred vision in the #1 spot.  My doctor didnt mention this when pescribing it or I would have stuck with dramamine.  I took it off immediately.  Its 3 days later and my vision is still jacked up.

42, 1, cruise,cotton mouth and blurred vision while on it.  It helped me not get sick on my cruise.,But o man about 2 days after I stopped taking this I couldn't drive to work with out getting so motion sick that I had to go back home.  Confusion and I thought maybe I was going a little crazy_ very scared that it wasn't going to go away_ dizzy spells out of the blue.  Cant focus on my work.  Worse after affects than LSD or any other drug I have ever took and I have took a lot of different drugs.  It has been three weeks and my body and mind are finally starting to feel normal again.  I wore the patch for 10 days changing it every three days behind my right ear.  And when I took it off my salivary glands were swollen and I got a horrible sore throat.  It has been three weeks and I can still feel the after affects a little bit and my sore throat and salivary glands still hurt.  NOT WORTH IT STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG.  SHOULD NOT BE LEGALL!!!!!!!!!,M,30,10  days 1X D,2/9/2014,Transderm scop
43, 1, Cruise,While taking drug very dry mouth_ blurry vision and dilated eyes_ also very little urination. Did not suffer seasickness so I thought it was great. Used 2 patches every third day_ had an itchy feeling around patch.,Exactly 24 hours after taking off patch was when the real issues began. I could not function because of the dizziness_ nausea_ blurry vision and severe fatigue.  Thought it was jet lag and trying to get my land legs back. This is now day six and I have had issues with my balance_ confusion_ my head feeling full_ a floaty feeling_ trouble focusing and reading_ exhaustion_ a rash_ headaches_ nauseated feeling_ sweaty_ and weird dreams.  Also_ my period stopped instantly when I was on the patch and now 10 days later it has started again_ 6 days after taking the patch off.  It's hard to describe to others how I feel...just out of it and my body feeling weird.  What the heck was in that drug that it takes so long to get out of your system? My 13 year old son wore a patch for 2 days and took it off. He says he felt fine while wearing it.I would never use this again.  Will use the wristbands next time.

45, 1, Disney trip,24 hours after taking off patch I had severe nausea and dizziness - lasted for 24 hours. Not sure how common these side effects are as this site seems to report mostly bad side effects. It helped while on vacation to reduce nausea on roller coasters but man did I pay for it afterwards. Also my box didn't tell me to switch ears per 3 day applications which may have made my side effects worse.  I'll just stay off roller coasters_ not worth it for me.,,M,43,9  days 1X O,11/30/2013,Transderm scop
46, 1, Motion Sickness/7-day Cruise,Blurred vision_ Parkinson-like tremors_ moderate confusion_ short-term memory loss_ nausea,Twenty-three years ago I underwent back surgery and was given Scopolamine to treat the nausea and vomiting which I had post-operatively. I developed hallucinations_ a very frightening experience_ and the Scopolamine had to be discontinued. Despite that experience_ being a long-time sufferer of motion sickness_ I  decided to try the Transderm Scop Patch when I was going on my first cruise 4 years ago.  It worked very well for me at that time. A few weeks ago_ my husband and I were going on our 2nd cruise_ and this time_ the experience was totally different.  Although it seemed to control the motion sickness for the first 6 days of the cruise_ blurred vision_ tremors_ and moderate confusion occurred from about day 2 on_ although at the time I did not connect these symptoms with the patch and thought perhaps they were related simply to being on the sea.  On day 6_ after replacing the 2nd patch with the 3rd to cover my final day on board_ I became seriously nauseous.  We disembarked the next day_ and I felt moderately nauseous during our 2 days on land and our 10 hour plane trip home.  But the next day_ when I was settled back at home_ I became significantly nauseous which has caused me to be non-functional for a week now.  I feel OK when in a prone position but become nauseous when I stand and move around in any way and fall asleep very readily. I would never use this medication every again and would strongly discourage others from doing so.,F,67,7  days 1X O,11/4/2013,Transderm scop

Felt like I was coming down with a stomach bug.  Felt very dizzy_ blurred vision_ no appetite_ heart racing_ headache.  I started searching on line about my symptoms and so glad I came across this site.  I was starting to think I was going crazy!  I am now on my 6th day of feeling like this.  Vision is getting better but dizziness_ anxiety and fast heart rate are the same.  I cannot believe that these side effects are not more known by medical professionals.  The only thing I was told was that my mouth would get dry.  I would never have used this patch if I knew about these withdrawal symptoms!  I just wish I knew how long I'd feel this way.

I did not know what was wrong with me for the first 2 days after I had returned home from a surgery.They gave me the patch to help with Nausea. I first started feeling dizzy and disoriented and then the anxiety started. I could not walk and my heart was pounding. I have done my share of drugs and I will tell you right now this was the worst and most scary experience I have ever had. I thought I had permanently lost my mind. I spent all night awake and hyperventilating.I thought I was having a heart attack. I tried other things to calm me down but nothing helped. I am lucky my boyfriend took care of me. It lasted about 4 days and the worst 2 days where in the middle. I will never take this drug again. The doctors did not believe me when I called and told them what was happening and that made me even more scared until my boyfriend found this site and read the review.  at least then I knew I wasn't going mental.,Stay Away from this drug,F,26,2  dayspatch 1X D,6/11/2013,Transderm scop

I had to have my husband come to my work and take me home. I slept all night but woke up with the same side effects literally no memory_ very scared and confused. Husband took me to the ER. They did cat scan and blood work and told me to drink lots of fluids. Doctors didn't seem to know about drug effects. I became worse within a few days. Finally got to the point where I was studdering and couldn't remember anything. I became catatonic and couldn't speak at all when I was finally rushed again to the ER. I was placed in ICU for 24 hours and had testing for a stroke. I also had vomiting_ high blood pressure and fast heart rate. MRI_ and every other test said no stroke. reaction to the patch.

I had the prescription filled as I wanted to do everything I could for a fast recovery! Approximately 15 days later_ after using all 4 patches in the prescription and having come home wearing 1_ I took the last patch off and 24 hours later it was on!The first signs of more withdrawals yet to come were projectile vomiting and an extreme headache behind my left eye; after which forced me_ while still nauseated with bouts of dizziness_ trouble urinating_ and sensitivity to light_ to research what this patches active ingredient is and to my surprise it is scopolamine thus scop_ which I surmise was used to deceive the consumer/patient.

Take 50MG every 6 hours for 3 days_ and then try spreading them to every 12 hours if you can_ for 3 days and taper down for the next 3 days to 25MG.  Here is the website where I found my protocol:  http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Ear--Nose--Throat/scopolamine-withdrawal/show/391762Everyone needs to be their own advocate and research all medications before use!

By the third day I was able to keep down flat ginger ale.  At day 4_ I can eat low sodium chicken noodle soup_ toast_ crackers_ etc.  Initially_ I had mild blurred vision which has cleared up completely.,I've used this patch for much shorter timeframes in the past with no adverse effects.  My motion sickness isn't limited to ships - I get very sick in cars_ etc.  Since our cruise also included excursions in mountainous areas_ I kept the patch on the entire 14 days.  I had no ill effects until I removed it.  I noticed a small of amount of visual blurring when we got home_ but that cleared up within a day.  Within 4 hours of removing the patch_ I had hot flashes_ was dizzy and thought I was going to throw up (in a restaurant).  Once home_ I had to go straight to bed. The next morning_ I felt kind of OK_ so I drank a small smoothie.  That was the beginning of the end.  From that point_ I threw up whenever I tried to drink anything for the next 2 days.  I thought I'd have to go to the hospital to be treated for dehydration if I couldn't begin keeping liquids down soon.  After finally settling my stomach with flat ginger ale_ I've been able to keep very plain_ bland foods down - I feel like someone who's on a chemo diet.  Anything with much of a fat content (like a pat of butter) goes right through me_ however_ I feel so much better than I did a few days ago_ it's like a new me.

Today I woke up feeling a little better to start_ then an hour or so ago_ just started feeling out of it and couldn't stop crying...more anxiety.

80, 4, Vertigo/Meniere's Disease,,I've tried almost everything under the sun to help with my daily bouts of vertigo due to Meniere's Disease. The Scop patch is the only medication that has reliably helped; it cut down my episodes of vertigo from every day (sometimes a couple times a day) to 2-4 times a week. In preparation for surgery_ my ENT wanted me to wean off the scop.  I took off the patch before a 3-day weekend after reading about terrible withdrawal.  12 hours after removal_ withdrawal kicked in.  One study online had recommended a meclizine taper to counter the withdrawal_ so as soon as I started feeling the extreme vertigo and nausea_ I took 2 tablets of OTC meclizine (less-drowsy version of dramamine) and 8 mg of Zofran.  Every 4-6 hours I took another tablet of each for the first day.  Day 2_ I cut down to every 8 hours_ then day 3_ every 12 hours.  I was able to go to work on day 4.  I'm now on a 3 days on_ 2 days off schedule for the patch until my surgery.  It gives me some relief from vertigo_ and the only withdrawal with that short of a duration is a headache for a few hours 12-24 hours after taking it off.  For me_ the benefit of reduced vertigo in my daily life outweighs the mildly annoying side effects and the withdrawal.  I wouldn't strongly recommend this medication for just a cruise or air travel_ but for people with daily vertigo that doesn't abate with more common treatments_ this medication may vastly improve quality of life.,F,26,4  months1 patch 1X D,5/8/2012EmailHistory,Transderm scop

84, 3, cruise,vertigo_ nausea_ headache,I have used the patch many times for cruises and it usually makes me feel OKAY on the boat_ I never feel great. I ALWAYS feel bad after I take it off. Luckily I dont feel as bad as many of the people who have written on here before_ I usually have vertigo and nausea for awhile after I take the patch off. The ONLY thing that sometimes makes me feel better is to take a warm bath_ Im not sure why it helps so much_ maybe because I can actually match my vertigo up the the way the water moves or something but it definitely makes me feel better. Also_ dont bother calling them about questions_ they had me on hold for 20 minutes_ asked me a million questions and then told me they couldnt help me because they werent doctors... gee thanks. The only good information that I got from them was that it takes 4.5 days for the medicine to leave your system and if you feel bad after taking off the patch then youre probably having withdrawls!

I ended up seeing my doctor and missing work due to the side effects of the medication. Very nasty side effects. Make sure you consult your family physician before using this product.

86, 1, To combat sickness after surgery,Nausea_ blurred vision_ itchy skin_ dizziness_ uncontrolled vomiting_ headaches_ and right eye is dilated.,I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN POISONED!  This patch was put on me just before my surgery_ nurse said it would help the nausea I get when under general anestesia.  I was only warned about touching the patch_ then touching my eye.  Didn't sound bad at all.  I wore it for just over three days then removed it.  I woke up yesterday feeling very nauseous_ dizzy_ and exhausted. I had some of the symptoms during the 3 days wearing the patch_ but assumed it was from surgery.  My vision was so blurry_ I could not read.  I have the hives_ severe headaches_ dizziness_ fatigue_ and feel very depressed.  I am grateful that I ONLY wore it for 3 days.  My heart goes out to anyone who used it longer than I did.  I tried to explain to my husband what it feels like.  Try to imagine your worst hangover you've ever had_ now multiply that X's 10!!!  And don't forget to add all the other symptoms to that feeling. I would not recommend this poison to ANYONE!!! I hope to feel normal someday.,F,40,4  days 1X W,3/6/2012Email,Transderm scop
87, 1, 7 day cruise-1st time cruising,Cruising with my husband_ sister_ and her husband.  We all were told by friends to get the patch since it was our first cruise. We followed directions and changed patches every 3rd day.  It worked great during the cruise. High winds during cruise. They had to close top two decks one of the days.  Only side effects we had were dry mouth. It was after the cruise when the nightmare began!,"Just like everyone else has said it all started about 24 hrs. after taking the patch off.  It was awful!! All 4 of us said that if this was the price for cruising we didn't want to do it again!! We were vomiting_ dizzy_ chills_no energy_ sleeping_ etc.  Since this was our first cruise we thought we were just experiencing ""getting our land legs back""! I didn't think the cruising business would exist if everyone felt this bad afterwards_ so I did some research.  Wish I had researched the Transderm Scop as much as I did the cruise!  I wouldn't have taken it!  Not worth it!!!  No one talked about the side effects after you take the patch off!",F,60,7  days1.5 1X D,3/5/2012,Transderm scop
88, 4, Antarctic Cruise - Drake Passage,I was a little drowsy and some slight double vision_ but nothing to write home about. I would DEFINITELY take the patch again if I ever needed it. The side effects didb't bother me. I only noticed the double-vision when I was reading a book up close - no other time. And I just drank some tea to combat the drowsiness. But I also sleep really easy on boats so that could be making me sleepy too.,I have been off the patch for 3 days and have had no ill effects.

But 24 hrs after removing patch my husband began with severe nausea_ fatigue_ sleeplessness yet needing to sleep a lot_ strange dreams_ spinning thoughts and just feeling totally lousy. It's been five days now and he still has these symptoms to varying degrees. He starts to feel better for hours and then it hits him really hard again. Don't know how long this will last_ but it's encouraging to read so many posts from people with similar reactions.

Woke up with literally zero saliva in my mouth (couldn't even swallow) and unable to walk in a straight line.  Also felt extremely heavy-limbed_ dizzy_ and weak.  The patch may work for motion sickness aboard sea vessels (my mom uses it on every cruise) but for me_ it is TOTALLY not worth the side effects.  I ended up taking the less drowsy Dramamine and that did just fine.,Really_ really not worth it for me.  Take Dramamine instead.

I was nauseated for several days.  I actually started feeling sea sick when I took it off so I put it back on after I got off the boat.  I have had it off for a couple days now and my vision is extremely blurry.  I'm praying I get my vision back.  I wish people posted updates on here so I could see how long this might last.

The withdrawal hit me like a tidal wave and I was completely unprepared- I literally was so scared I had a total panic attack.  The room was spinning and I felt like I was floating.

However_ upon removing the patch I felt extreme dizziness_ fatigue/lethargy_ and intense nausea. As soon as I put the patch back on I felt fine again within 4 hours. I had to wear the patch for over 20 days and then stopped when my doctor told me to. I have been unable to drive_ work_ or function. I am constantly dizzy_ tired_ and on the verge of vomiting or actually vomiting. I have trouble finding the right words to say/ concentrating. I have no appetite and have lost 15 lbs. I am pale and my heart races sometimes when I try to walk a distance. I fainted and ended up in the ER. Most recently_ my left pupil is larger than my right. I have had a normal MRI_ vertigo and balance testing_ and vision screenings.

The last day started blurry vision that lasted for 8 WEEKS!,I started having blurred vision the last day of the cruise and just didn't feel well.  Removed the patch and then had withdrawal symptoms for about 7 days - dizziness_ blurred & double vision_ headache and nausea.  I could only see about two feet in front of me.  I went to the ENT that prescribed the patch and he said that it could not cause these symptoms.  He thought I had a stroke so I had an MRI & MRA.  Both showed no signs of stroke or anything else abnormal.  He sent me to an optometrist & an opthamologist.  Both doctors also said the patch could not cause this yet they couldn't explain my symptoms.  I could not see to drive for 6 weeks and my husband had to drive me to work every day and help me at the grocery store because I would get dizzy walking down the aisles.  I could finally see well enough to drive after 6 weeks and the blurry vision went away totally at 8 weeks.  I have spoken to other people that have had these symptoms including a doctor in Australia who knew about these horrible side effects and the vision problems that can last for 2 or 3 months.

103, 1, Vertigo/dizziness,"I was prescribed this during a particularly nasty bout of vertigo because my usual meclazine wasn't doing the trick.  I put a patch on_ ran an errand_ then laid down for an hour or so at home to wait for it to kick in as I had plans that evening.  About 4-5 hours later on as I was attending an event_ I suddenly experienced a severe chest pain - it felt like a massive cramp - extending from mid breastbone to diaphragm_ so bad I couldn't draw a breath for a few moments.  After the first bad pain_ I could breathe_ but it was difficult.  My boyfriend took me outside in the fresh air_ and got the patch off of me while I tried to breathe.  About 5 minutes after the patch came off_ the pain disappeared.  I called my doctor the next day to tell them what had happened and was told not to put the patch back on (DUH!!) even though the doctor ""still felt it was the best treatment"" for my dizziness.  I didn't have any other side effects once the patch was off_ but I have a feeling that ma",My father was prescribed this for nausea during the last stages of cancer and it worked well for him right up until his last few days when he literally needed to be sedated to avoid dry-heaving.

Worse of all_ I had an episode on cruise ship where I fell down stairs (may or may not have been contributed to by above side effects) fainted_ and had to seek emergency medical attention. The ship doctor removed the patch immediately and said never to take it again. He could not believe I had taken as instructed for 7 days- said the patch is very bad for people.  It had caused my blood pressure to drop extremely low. (I am a norm healthy_ active 29 y.o. with normal blood pressure). Had to give IV fluids and other medicine for dehydration. Was a scary 40 minutes in hospital bed waiting for blood pressure to return to normal and heart rate to get back to normal. I thought i was clumsy and panicked- however now realize after reading all these other posts that the patch contributed to this. I was so startled by this event_ I dont think I remember how bad the withdrawl effects were. I thought the dizziness_ exhaustion and other effects,I didnt believe the doctor- but now see these other posts and wish I knew this before hand.

It made me feel way worse than I ever did to begin with.  I thought taking the patch off would make me feel better but the withdrawal side effects are horrible!  24 hours after I removed it I became very nauseous and had a bad cramp in my stomach.  I became very sweaty and felt like I couldn't move.  I took the patch off three days ago and I'm still not feeling normal!  I'm very easily confused and I cannot remember things that have just happened.  The night after I took it off I had hallucinations and thought there was a giant spider chasing me out of my room at 2 in the morning.  I am a small girl (100 lbs) and I think the dosage was way too much for my body!  Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT use this patch.  You will regret it.

The worst side effects occurred after I took the patch off once the trip ended. I applied the patch 5 hours prior to leaving for the trip_ the trip was 16 hours. A total of 21 hours that I had the patch applied. It's been 7 days since then and my stomach is still queasy and I am still getting dizzy and light-headed whenever I change positions (lying_ standing up). Wow.

116, 2, I was given it while before surgery,After my surgery_ I was nauseous--and_ in fact vomited three times_ so it didn't do a great job of controlling my nausea.What is far worse_ though_ is that while taking the drug_ I have experienced a significant worsening of my vision. I was already wearing reading classes (especially at night when I was tired)_ but could read fairly easily without them.  While I had the patch (and still_ two days after removing the patch)_ I cannot read ANYTHING without reading glasses--it is scary.  I don't know how long it will take before my vision returns to normal.,As I was prescribed the patch while I had surgery_ there could be other drugs that caused my blurred vision--the anesthesia_ the pain medicine (hydrocodone acetominophen) or the antibiotics (cephalexin) I was prescribed after surgery.  However_ I took these two drugs for two days only because I developed a severe rash so discontinued both.  Unfortunately_ I left the transderm patch on for five days because I forgot it was there.  That's why I think it is the cause of the blurred vision.  Also_ I found an article on blurred vision following wearing a scopolamine patch that describes my symptoms almost exactly.  Here's the address if you want to read it: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hup.470010209/pdfMy advice to medical practitioners it to tell people to take the patch off as soon as possible--I had no need to leave it on_ and didn't remember it until my first attempt to wash my hair five days after having surgery on my arms.

Have had symptoms for 6 days now_ but appear to be slowly improving.,Since stopping this medication my ability to drive or concentrate has been severely impaired.  Visit to doctor's office accomplished nothing_ they do not seem to know or understand why this is happening_ although they did indicate that it could possibly be from patch.  Was told if symptoms did not improve within a week to return to office.

125, 1, Post operative nausea,I was given the 1.5mg patch PRIOR to having surgery to alleviate post-operative nausea.  After arriving home and not experiencing any nausea at all I removed the patch not more than six hours after applying it.  The day after surgery I felt wonderful_ two days after surgery I felt horrible.  My symptoms included; severe dizziness_ nausea_ lethargy_ cloudy head_ upset stomach and sensitivity to light.  I eventually went into ER however_ the ER medical staff could not diagnose my problem other than having vertigo. I've never had vertigo and wondered how you 'catch' vertigo?  Anyway_ after the ER I began searching the net and found askapatient.com.  Alas_ I know know the source of all my trouble.  I can not tell you how relived I am to know what has been causing my symptoms.  This patch was on my skin for maybe 3 hours and haven't felt right for three days.  Today_ being my third day_ I am beginning to feel better but not 100%.

127, 3, Post surgery nausea,Worked wonderfully to control nausea after surgery.   Some dry mouth and a strange metallic taste.   I removed the patch after 3 days and the next evening was suddenly hit with severe dizziness_ nausea_ increased heartrate and headache.  I was home alone with my young son and had to call 911 asI had no idea what was happening to me.  The EMT said they have seen other people abruptly stop the patch and have serious withdrawal symptoms.   No one  told me in the hospital not to remove it suddenly.  If doctors are going to prescribe it they need to be vey careful to tell people everything before they put it on.  I'm still dizzy 3 days later and have been very sick since I took it off.  It's miserable to throw up just days after abdominal surgery.  My husband is stuck taking care of 4 kids because I'm incapicatated more than I should be after a simple surgery.,It worked great for the nausea I experience after surgery but I'm not sure the side effect were worth it.,F,36,2  days1 patch 1X D,1/16/2011,Transderm scop

My husband had to walk me to the room.  I laid down and closed my eyes and had horrible hallusinations.  I woke up the next day_ thought I would be okay_ by dinner time again_ I had the same symptoms and thought I was having anxiety attacks (which I never had before).  Missed that dinner too.  Then the next day I was okay_ then the day after that I was at breakfast at the resort and the same symptoms hit me_ very dizzy_ anxious_ things were spinning_ I had to go to the room once again.  We were at an all inclusive resort for this trip and half of it was horrible because of this patch! After getting home I had been off the patch for a day and I went back to work and had another episode.  I guess I have to wait until it gets out of my system completely.  This was a very expensive trip that was ruiened.  I kept thinking I was having anxiety attack,The Dr. should have warned me about this.  They need to take it off the market now.

Researched on the internet and no-one had remedies.  I ended up wearing the elastic Sea Bands 24 hours a day and took dramamine.  I wasn't dizzy 24/7 just in the middle of the day for some reason.  It was pretty extreme.  Even though I had a great trip on the patch_ I'm not sure if I'd do it again.

Changed patches every 72 hrs as directed.  2 days later while watching TV my vision became very blurry both closeup and at a distance.  Headache started_ had slight difficulty walking.  Thinking I might be having a stroke_ I went to ER. They did blood work_ CT scan of brain_ EKG_ ran an IV w/diazepam and zofran.  When they put me at a 45 degree angle things started spinning fast.  The Dr. had me follow a light with my eyes and they were shaking and darting around.  He diagnosed me with Vertigo.  I mentioned to him I  had just come off a very bumpy cruise_but he didn't seem to think it was related.  Afer reading this website....I know it was the patch.  The ER Dr. gave me a Rx for meclizine and I took 2 and most of my symptons went away. He advised I take this as needed.  My spinning has stopped_ but my vision gets a little blurry on & off.  In the future I will just take Bonine or dramamine ,F,54,7  days1.5mg 1X O,10/16/2010,Transderm scop

I hope these problems are not permanent.,I have used this patch in the past without incident but only wore it for less than 24 hours. This product is dangerous if used for several days.

144, 1, surgery,I took the patch off 3 days after surgery and within 12 hours had extreme dizziness and nausea. Assuming it was from the pain meds (which is why I initially got the patch) the doc prescribed more patches. After finishing with pain meds a 1 week and a half later_ I tried taking the patch off again and after 12 hours was sick again so I went back on the patch. This past Saturday I finally decided to take it off and suffer the side effects and today_ Friday_ am just now feeling better. Like others on this site_ it wasn't just dizziness and nausea that I experienced. While on the patch my vision was blurred and still 6 days after removing it is not back to normal. Also_ every time I drift off to sleep I dream in fast forward. I have had to take a sleep aid every night because my mind is constantly racing and I can't fall asleep. I applied a total of 7 patches.,Thank God for this post or I would have been really frightened about the way I was feeling! I know people who have had no problems with this drug_ but I will NEVER take it again. I am convinced that I was more sick from removing the patch that I would have been without it.

I started to become very disoriented and could barely figure out how to call 911 as I kept fainting every time I tried to get up.

I thought a good nights sleep would get me back to normal_ but i feel worse today (day 2 of being off). Thankful for this forum_ I was worried there was something really wrong with me. I feel nauseous_ dizzy_ light headed_ cloudy_ constipated_ anxious_ emotional_ sensitive to light and sound_ short of breath. It is an awful withdrawal. The fun I had on the cruise is not worth how I feel now.,I would not use this patch again. I would try bonine or just not go on a cruise. It is not worth it.

It can make you sick if you take too much so he suggested that we cut it up and not use the whole patch.  My husband and I both used only a quarter of a patch(cut it up into 4 pieces) and it worked great!  We did not feel sick or sleepy!  It was just enough to take the edge off so we could enjoy our cruise.  We did change it and put a new piece on after 3 days.

I wore one patch for 3 days as recommended then took it off and threw out the rest. The side of my face the patch was on felt weird and sort of numb as soon as I put it on. I had extreme dry mouth and fatigue. The next day I couldn't see clearly and could not walk up a flight of stairs without being totally out of breath. It did work for seasickness but I took it off on day 3 because I was going to going biking and hiking and felt I couldn't work out while wearing the patch. About 12 hour after I took it off_ I got seasick (vomited) and generally felt sad and lonely despite being with friends. I was also paranoid that the ship would sink. For the rest of the trip I took non-drowsy dramamine and ginger pills and was okay. I still feel like I'm on a moving ship 2 days after I got off the cruise but all other symptoms are gone.

153, 3, vertigo,extreme dry mouth the longer I was on it_ soreness and itch at patch site_ felt like my eyes were bugging out of my head.,I would not recommend the use of this patch. I was put on for my vertigo and although it helped alot with that the side effects and with drawal symptoms were not worth it. I did not read about this drug untill after I had been on it for almost a week_ Ive been kicking myself in the butt since.  After reading about the withdrawals symptoms on here I decided to go off it_ called both of my drs_ my neurologist and primary and both said that because of the amount of time I was on it that I wouldnt have any withdrawal issues_ the neurologist recommend that since it was helping me that I stay on it_ my primary said that since the side effects were getting worse to go off it immediatly. So on 530 wednesday eve. I took it off and braced myself for at least 3 days of hell. I started to drink as much water as I could tolerate 12 hours after taking the patch off as well as started taking 12.5 mg of my meclizine every 6 to 8 hours in hopes of counter acting the withdrawal symptoms. I started with symptoms at the 12 hour mark after taking the patch off_ that included dizziness_ diareah_ uspet stomach/heartburn_ numbness_ tiredness_and extreme dry mouth. That all continued untill about the 44 hour mark_ when all I had was on and off dizziness and numbness in my face. For me the withdrawal syptoms were no worse than a bad case of vertigo but Im very happy I had my meclizine to get through it.

I started using the TransDerm scopolamine patch when I got severe constant vertigo while on vacation.  Unfortunately_ the onset of my vertigo was caused by an allergic reaction to another medication_ Lamisil_ also made by Novartis.  In order to be able to function as a mother_ I used a TransDerm patch for 8 weeks.  I experienced the dry mouth and dilated pupils just like everyone else_ but that was nothing compared to the damage this patch was causing my body.  It actually was prolonging my vertigo instead of helping it!  Finally I went to an Ear Specialist who made me take it off!  He told me it was dangerous to wear it long-term.  My inner ear had become dependent on the patch and could no longer function on its own.  So I had to take it off.  I was aware of the withdrawal symptoms that I would experience so we came up with a plan to use high doses of Meclizine to control the nausea and severe,If my entry keeps one person from using a TransDerm scopolamine patch_ it will be worth my time!

Well we had to go to NY for my father in laws funeral and oh my GOD!!!!!!!!! the side effects were HELL_ I`ll put it like this they had to land the plane in Richmond VA airport to let me off the plane I was so sick. At first I started getting nausea about an hour after wearing (and by the way I have no fear of flying) then it got so strong I had to run to the bathroom and throw up and it was so violent_ I was also shaking really bad_ I felt as if I was going to die_ well they piolot announced that were getting close to NY so everyone had to be seated and wear seat belts_ well I couldn`t get out of the restroom plus I was so shaky I couldnt bear to be around anyone_ so I refused and they called for any Drs on the plane and 2 Drs stood up and came back and checked on me_ they said my pulse was thready (whatever that means) and that I didnt look good. So they landed the plane in Va and had paramedics waiting took vitals bloodpressure was not normal_ I was a mess from the patch. They told me to take it off and that it would take around 4 hours to wear off_ and it did. Needless to say I missed the funeral because I had to sit at the airport all alone until I felt better and told my hubby to go without me_ the airline gave me an open ticket to come later that day when I was better.

These symptoms became worse on my flight home and I ended up in the ER with elevated blood pressure and a low pulse rate. I thought I was dying. I had a less severe episode of withdrawal on a previous cruise but only now do I realize that these symptoms are a result of Scop withdrawal.,Use this drug at your own health risk.

159, 1, surgery,My 80 yr old mother was given this patch to prevent nausea from anesthesia.  After 8 hours she displayed symptoms of disorientation_ had hallucinations_ slurred speech_ insomnia.  Could not follow directions_ her eyes darted all around_ thought her IV tubing was a light bulb_ saw spiders on the wall_ did not know her husband.  After 6 hours of symptoms we removed the patch and 3 hours later she started to become lucid.  It took 2 days before she became normal again.

I went on the patch originally for an African safari and the road travel.  I have suffered from motion sickness most of my life.  I continued on the patch once I returned_ believing that my motion sickness issues progressed.  It was actually withdrawal that not one of my doctors (2)_ nurses (2)_ or pharmicist (1)_ mentioned or considered.  I have been on the patch since September 1st and at this point am trying to plan my withdrawal so that I can then try an anti-seizure med to control the motion sickness.  I am usually sick on a daily basis and most typically as I am driving home from work at night.  I did not even need to wait 24 hours for withdrawal symptoms.  It hits me quickly and I experience nausea and vomiting.  Inow need to plan for a week out of work so that I can come off of this evil ""dot"" that has left burn marks on my body.

My doctor prescribed another patch.  15 min after putting it on the nausea stopped but the blurred vision and fuzziness remained.,I have never thrown up so violently.  I feel like I was poisoned.  I wore the second patch for three days.   When I removed it I started taking high doses of non-drowsy dramamine to avoid the withdrawal symptoms I believed caused the vomiting.

Two weeks later had the same mind racing_ difficult sleeping experience as before with some occasional mild anxiety and loss of appitite again but this time lasting 6 days. 5+ weeks later I am trying to feel better.

I never felt an ounce of nausea the entire trip---airplane_ ship_ limo (sat facing backwards!)_ buses on winding_ winding roads. Even eating all kinds of different foods and MANY alcoholic beverages didn't make me nauseated. It was absolutely wonderful. Used a patch for three days_ washed/dried the area behind the ear and stuck another one on. Needed to wear three patches in all to get me from home to back to home (was nine days away with air travel etc.) I am amazed I had such great luck with the patch_ I am extremely sensitive to medicines and usually avoid them at all costs. I had no real side effects in the days that followed after taking the patch off. I was extremely tired for a few days (I was just on a MAJOR vacation that felt like an Amazing Race_ so figure it was that more than anything_ plus came back from a six hour time change and had to readjust)_ felt a little 'wavy' but figured it was from being on a boat. Was a little 'depressed'_ but my vacation was done and I had such a wonderful time_ I didn't want it to end. So_ most of the side effects of withdrawal were mild to none. My eyesight took the longest to come back_ but wasn't a big deal_ had to relearn to 'focus' up close but just did some eye exercises to accomplish that.

I finally did research on the patch when every time I removed it I became sick within 24 hours.  I am now on my fourth day of withdrawal.  First day was nausea_ second day was nervousness_ third day included headaches_ and today I am still not good but better.,Do not let anyone put this nausea patch behind your ear for surgery.

One doctor at the Mayo finally gave me this ear patch for my nausea. It worked! I've been using them for 6 months now. I tried not putting one on this morning and I was throwing up.

I would never have used this had I known these things would happen.  I came to this site because after 3 days of wearing the patch_ and after a full MRI in the ER - I realized that these problems are all side effects of this horrible drug!!! I've been off the patch for 2 days now_ and the dizziness has returned and I still cannot see clearly.    It seems that recovery time is different for everyone... I pray things get back to normal soon.,Why are the warnings of the side effects of this horrible drug not told to patients before they are subjected to this torment???,F,32,3  days,10/22/2008,Transderm scop
206, 3, cruise,Used 2 patches and changed every 3 days as directed during cruise.  Side effects while using patches: sore throat_ red eyes_ blurry vision_ dilated eyes.  It worked great for my motion sickness most of the time.  We hit some rough seas for a few hours and I had to lie down.  Most of the cruise was pretty smooth.,After removing the patch I had major withdrawal symptoms about 24 hours later.  First nausea and then dizziness. Had to take a Dramamine to get rid of rocking feeling.  Was not able to drive or do much for several days.  One day I could not stop fidgeting.  This led to pacing and a couple panic attacks.  Felt like I was losing my mind.  Felt very disconnected from my body and weak.  Pharmacist and doctor had no knowledge of possible withdrawal.  The major part of withdrawal lasted for about 3 days and tapered off throughout the remaining 3 days.  I ate a lot and drank lots of water_ ginger ale_ and cranberry juice to try and flush my system.  Not sure if this helped or not. Ginger ale seemed to really help with nausea. Will look for alternative treatments for future travels.,F,32,6  days,10/18/2008,Transderm scop
207, 5, motion sickness,slight off-taste at back of throat; very MINIMAL eyesight change,This has been a life saver/quality of life enhancer drug for me and I been using it since it came out -- over a decade. I have very bad motion sickness -- I can't even ride in the backseat of a car for long distances -- but I love to travel and my job requires travel as well. I would suggest to users the following: (1) start with a 1/2 patch by cutting it in half. This works for most people; (2) don't wear it 24 hours a day! Even on a cruise_ you are on land a good part of the time and don't need it. Additionally_ on a longer cruise_ you might find that 2 or 3 days out_ you are used to the ship motion and don't require it; (3) Don't drink. Just like Dramamine and many other medications_ alcohol does not mix; (4) Just like any other medication_ really discuss it with your health care provider and be absolutely honest on all the medications and herbals/supplements/vitamins you already take.,F,49, ,10/3/2008,Transderm scop

I thought I was going blind. Also nausea & dizziness were experienced. I basically spent 3 days in bed in my cabin. I've never felt so lathargic and disoriented. After the 2nd day_ the patch was removed.,I wish I would have either avoided the cruise altogether OR dealt with the motion sickness on my own.

I was fine on the ship and planes.  I took the last one off and two days later_ drove 9 hours to Atlanta from Florida.  I kept feeling like I was still on the ship and thank God my problems did not occur while on the road!  Once I sat down for dinner_ the bottom dropped out.  I started shaking_ got sweaty_ my heart was racing_ felt confused_ light headed_ headache.....I excused myself and requested to go to the ER. I felt like I was having an out of body experience...just out of the blue I fell apart.  Once at the ER_ my blood pressure was up and my heart was still racing. I and my family were scared to death!

216, 1, 13 Day Cruise,"Used 5 patches for 16 days on a cruise. Very effective at preventing seasickness. On Day 1 of a new patch_ my side effects were drowsiness and extreme blurred vision when reading. Otherwise_ sight seemed OK. Vision was a little better on Day 2_ and normal by Day 3 of a patch. Because it was so good at preventing seasickness_ I continued taking the patches for the entire trip. The withdrawal kicked in 12 hours after removing the patch. I had severe nausea_ dizziness_ and headaches that lasted for 4 days. Unable to get out of bed. After 4 days_ the nausea and dizziness subsided_ but headaches continued for another day. Also had several nights of not being able to sleep following those first 4 bad days. When I would finally doze off_ I suffered intense_ fast-moving ""dreams.""

This covered a 6 hour plane flightto Arizona_a helicopter ride through the Canyon_ boat rides on the Colorado river_ and the plane flight back to Florida.  It worked GREAT for all these activities.... BUT the price I paid after i got home was not worth it!!  I took my patch off the night we flew in_ the following day I was fine_ but the second day ---WHEW!  Feelings of motion sickness_ nausea_ violent vomitting_ diarhea_ blurred vision_ dizziness_ irregular heart rates for 2 days.  This is my 4th day after removing the patch_ I got up thinking I was feeling OK until I got in my truck to drive to work.

Other than a dry mouth_ I never had a problem the rest of the trip and removed the patch yesterday after returning home. Today_ I feel dizzy_ lightheaded and nauseous. I feel worse than I ever did while on the ship. It's hard for me to concentrate at work_ too.

When I still did not have my ""land-legs"" back over three days after returning home_ I put another patch on for 72-hours.  That seemed to help a lot.  Since then_ I have felt like I am still on the ship_ dizzy_ off center_ light-headed.

The worst is when i took the patch off and 24 hours later the withdrawal effects kicked in. The pharmacist or my pcp never warned me about withdrawal effects. If I would have known that I would have never used it. TAKE BONINE INSTEAD!!!!! I would tell everyone to never use the patch!

222, 3, Severe Motion Sickness,While wearing the patch I experienced dry mouth and blurred vision.,I started wearing the patch because I have to take the train to work and the wrist bands did not help my motion sickness.  There is no doubt that the patch prevents motion sickness but the withdrawal symptoms are horrible.  I changed the patch out every three days but took it off during the weekends.  I'm having headaches_ confusion_ nausea_ dizziness_ and just feeling out of it.  It is not worth it.  I would like to go back to enjoying my weekends with my husband.  He hasn't been back from Iraq that long and we try to spend as much time together as possible.  The past couple of weekends_ I have been so out of it_ that all I want to do is sleep.

I used the scop.patch for the flght. It worked like a charm minus the sedation I usually experience with dramamine. Two days later during a long and bumpy ride I became very nauseous.

Dry mouth_ blurred vision_ but felt fine on the water... She removed the patch after getting off the plane_ several hours later she felt as if she was seasick. This went on all night. The next day our son read that your body goes through a transformation back to land_ and she was reacting to that. So we thought_ lets put the patch back on until her body is adjusted. Mistake! When we removed the patch in 48 hours_ the sickness started again_ and became worse. This went on for over 4 days. We learned also it was the dependency on the drug. I think the longer you use it_ and probably your size has a lot to do with this. It has been nearly 5 months now.

It worked perfectly with no problems when I stopped using them. I had my 4th surgery on April 19_ 2007. I have had benign positional vertigo since caused by my eyes not being aligned and my eye has somewhat dropped so now my eyes are uneven. I went to an ENT specialist who confirmed the vertigo_ gave me a prescription for the patches with 4 refills. He said I can continue to use them until my next surgery_ so_ I have been using them since April 18th.

241, 2, ,Five weeks ago_ I put a patch on a Thursday morning for only 2 hours for a 1 hour flight. I took it off immediately after the plane landed. On Friday_ I put on another patch for a return flight. I thought that since the trips were so short this would be ok. In the past when I wore 1 patch for 3 days_ my vision was so blurry I could not read at the meetings and my vision was blurred for days. I must have over dosed because for the last 5 weeks I have had headaches_ distorted vision_ vertigo_ loss of appetite and have been vomiting. I've seen 3 doctors and have had an MRI and I am waiting for the results.,I am terrified that this is permanent. Before this_ I thought that Transderm scop was a gift. I have never been able to travel well_ but after using the TS I was liberated. Not only could I fly with ease_ but I could read on the plane.

242, 1, Post-surgical anesthesia nausea,Blurred vision_ severe dry mouth_ slowed motor skills_ generally odd feeling overall_ swollen earlobe and irritated skin where patch was put_ strange traveling numbness in face for about 30 minutes when symptoms first began,Terrible side effects began 24 hours after removing the patch and the night after that I ended up in the ER.  Even though I thought it might be the patch because my earlobe was swollen_ doctor didn't think my symptoms were connected.  Went to see regular doctor and she noted that my eyes were not completely constricting_ hence the blurred vision.  This is the same drug that is used to dilate your eyes for exams_ so she called the optometry department and they said effects could last a week. I believe the dry mouth is caused because the drug effectively paralyzes your salivary glands. Most symptoms disappeared suddenly five days after removing patch_ except the blurred vision which took another week.  Although it did prevent nausea_ would have rather have been sick for a day or so after the surgery. Shame that doctors and pharmacists don't have enough info about the side effects.,F,43,2  days,6/5/2007,Transderm scop

We are crossing our fingers for all these side affects to quickly go away so her life can return to normal...be careful to read up on this medicine if you are thinking about using it_ especially if you are sensitive to meds in general to start with.",,F,42,9  days,7/30/2006,Transderm scop
249, 3, Cruise,"My wife used this for a recent cruise we were on.  While using the patch_ she felt fine. 2 days after removing the patch(she wore it for 5 days) she started feeling nauseas.  2 days after that_ we were in the emergency room due to dizzyness_ fatigue_ numbness in her arms and face_ and overall ""not feeling right.""  after a battery of tests_ the doctor concluded it was a withdrawl or overdose of the medication.  It has now been 4 days since she has been off the drug and things are up and down. I know that we both can not wait until she feels back to normal. If you are sensative to medications_ my wife is_ I would recommend bypassing this drug.",,F,31,5  days,10/26/2005,Transderm scop
250, 3, vertigo,Being on the patch was bad enough but when I asked to be removed the withdrawal was horrible.  I began to experience panic and anxiety feelings (which I haven't had for over 15 years).  I actually thought I was having a nervous breakdown and contacted a psychologist.  My cognitive abilities were 0 the first 2 days coming off of it.  By the 6th day I was a nervous wreck and by day 7 I was normal again.  Maybe the patch isn't as bad as my quack Dr. who didn't warn me enough to not freak out over the horrible withdrawals.,,F,45,6  days,9/10/2005,Transderm scop
