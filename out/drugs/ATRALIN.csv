0, 5, light visual face blemishes,flaky skin at application sites.,My dermatologist prescribed this when I inquired about a solution to my ageing face skin texture. No not wrinkles_ all the other annoying changes to the skin on my face. I use it all the time_ skipping days here and there. The improvement was noticeable to me as well as my wife after a couple of weeks. Its tightens the skin and made it smoother. Its prescribed for acne but by removing dead skin in the process it leaves behind some great results and a little goes a long way. I experienced no side effects and I follow up in the AM with a SPF face cream.,M,58,2  years.05 1X D,6/3/2013Email,Atralin
