Minor hallucinations still occur from time to time nearly 9 weeks later_ with no prior history of any mental issues. Extremely terrifying for a mother trying to give birth.

12, 1, Broken arm,Vivid_ terrifying hallucinations,I was given Demerol about 30 years ago when the docs in emergency suspected I had broken my elbow. I was 6 at the time so do not recall what other side effects I experienced. I was put under but I am unsure whether that was due to the Demerol or another drug. When I awoke in the night I had hallucinations that there were aliens in my hospital room who were trying to kill me. I also saw bees and thought my skin had turned yellow and died. A horrifying experience for a six year old who was alone because the nurses told my mother I wouldn't wake up until the morning.,F,36,1  times 1X AN,3/19/2013,Demerol
13, 1, upper endoscopy,As soon as this hit my veins my body ached and I felt pain travel up both sides of my head.  After the procedure my feet and lower legs feel week and I have been in a constant state of feeling flu-like with a constant achy body_ especially in my shoulders.  Since the procedure my hands and feet feel shakey.  The procedure was at the end of December and it is now nearly the end of February and I still don't feel well.  Demerol is the only drug that I was told was used.,I am pretty sure I had Demerol once before during a difficult childbirth.  I remember it making me feel really good for a short period of time.  I think that is more typical.  This time I felt nothing but pain and achy body_ no euphoria_ nothing good_ was totally awake through the procedure_ felt everything.  Makes me wonder if they gave me the wrong drug or if something is wrong with me that I reacted this way.  I can't find where anyone else reports having a very similar reaction.  The pain crawling up my head was pretty strange.  It just traveled up and then stopped.  Ever since_ I have been left feeling just awful.,F,38,  1X D,2/21/2013Email,Demerol

16, 1, Intestine infection inflammation,The nurse gave it to me through IV. I am a petite person so she only gave me half of the usual dose for an adult. About two minutes after she gave it to me it felt like a ton of bricks had landed on my body. My arms_ legs_ and chest were so heavy I could barely move. I felt like I couldn't breath and my heart rate shot up. My breathing got shallow because my chest felt so heavy (not tight) it was hard to take breaths. Thank goodness she was still right there in my room because I couldn't talk. She gave me oxygen right away and had some other drug on stand by to inject in my IV in case I fully stopped breathing. After a few min. my blood pressure started to come down and I was able to communicate. I thought I was going to die. They said it was some sort of histamine reaction. It was so scary. I passed out asleep after that. I will never take this stuff again.,,F,29,1  daysIV 25MG 1X D,7/24/2012Email,Demerol

Very confused and irrational thinking. I remembered that I had a similar reaction 21 years ago when I was given Demerol after the birth of my son.

21, 2, colonoscopy,What side effects? I was injected  with 50 mg of IV Demerol for a colonoscopy and did not even feel the drug. If you have ever taken Demerol you know that this is impossible!  I believe that either the Demerol was switched with water or the doctor faked the IV injection because of the many misses of my vein.  (The nurse tried 3 times and the Doctor tried 3 times times (6 times at first) to to give me an IV and they could not hit a vein). I was in pain from all the misses. The doctor then tried vigorously for at least 10 minutes to talk me into doing the procedure without anestesia and I was adamant that I wanted to be sedated or I did not want to go through with the procedure. About 1/2 hour went by while the Doctor kept trying to hit a vein. (7 to 8 times & all misses) The doctor tried again to talk me into doing the procedure without anestesia and I refused again and told him to keep trying to hit a vein or give me an IM shot and wait 15 minutes for the medication to kick in. The,"I have had IV Demerol several times in the past and know what Demerol feels like and tastes like. When I was injected I felt and tasted nothing and immediately informed the doctor. He said don't worry you will feel it soon. The next thing I knew he was performing the procedure and I was in extreme pain. I asked for more pain medication and the doctor said ""I'll be done soon"". Several minutes more of severe pain went by and I complained again and he said ""I'm almost done"". A few tortuous minutes later I complained again and the Doctor removed the camera from my butt within a minute or 2. I was relieved but I am not stupid. I am 100% sure the injection they gave me was nothing. I believe the Doctor faked ""hitting a vein"" because of all the misses and elapsed time and knowingly gave me the procedure without the medication I insisted on. To confirm my suspicions I had a drug test done the next day and guess what? No Demerol in my system. This proved me right. The doctor gave me a colonoscopy without the anestesia I insisted on against my wishes. I was very unhappy and felt humiliated because I was made a fool of and  it was very unethical because it was strictly for the money and against my wishes. I was very unhappy . The only pleasant thing about a colonoscopy is the pain medication. I thought about suing for malpractice but I am not that kind of person but I can tell you this: that is the last time I will see that doctor.

23, 1, Oral Surgery,A disoriented_ dissociative high with no ability to communicate effectively_ or at least no memory of being able to communicate effectively. It did not mediate the pain and I had a full blown panic attack during the procedure. I could hear my heart monitor racing and the assistant had to strap my hands to the chair because I was trying to get them to stop cutting. I believe I blacked out of my own accord partway through the procedure_ but I vividly recall the pain.,"I was given an IV drip in preparation for having two wisdom teeth removed. I had specifically requested that an oral surgeon perform the procedure in a hospital_ and that hospital then approved anesthesia use with my healthcare provider. Then when I was in what I thought was the examination chair_ they told me I would be going under ""sedation"" right there and that they used Demerol and did not put people under anesthesia. Because I was in pain and had waited days for the procedure without any pain meds I signed a waver to allow them to administer the demerol and do the procedure. Demerol did not take away the pain_ instead I had a panic attack and remember the events of the procedure_ though I was so high I couldn't focus on anything in particular or communicate. It seems that there are a number of patient stories of being able to feel pain while on this medication that medical professionals don't acknowledge. I think flailing in a dental chair and needing my hands strapped down should have been a sign that something was wrong.",F,24,1  days 1X D,11/6/2010,Demerol

I also struggle with words & phrases. I'm extremely articulate_ but I am constantly struggling for the correct word or phrase.

There were no adverse physical effects aside from I was like out of it on the inside; almost like blacked out_ but not (speaking of after the procedure) but my family didn't realize this.  I had the BEST sleep that night.  I felt almost euphoric the next day; don't know if it was left over from the Demerol or from not eating for almost two days.  I love that stuff!!I'm planning on fasting for a couple of days to see if I get the same euphoric feeling that I had the day following the procedure to try to determine if it was the fast or the drug.  I'm thinking the effects of the drug (taken about about 4:30 p.m.) shouldn't have lasted into the next day.  But I don't know.,F,52,1  days 1X D,4/26/2010Email,Demerol

Tried many of the other analgesics but almost all were ineffective. Dialaudid worked well for pain relief but it made me very sick - like severe flu symptoms. Doctor hit upon Demerol. It works very well in relieving the pain. I supplement it with presciption dosage (800mg) Ibuprofin. The only side effect I experience is ""dry-heaving"" or vomitting.

41, 1, Post-op pain control,Extreme nausea_ vomiting_ dizziness_ little to no relief of pain. I had this after a myomectomy and after gall bladder removal. When the surgeon doing the myo saw it wasn't helping and just made me sick_ he immediately changed over to another analgesic (Fentanyl and then Toradol)_ and I felt much better--was able to walk around in a few hours and leave in just over a day. However_ the gall bladder surgery was a nightmare (my liver got nicked)_ and I was in agony in recovery--what actually woke me was vomiting. More Demerol created more vomiting_ and the surgeon left no orders for anything else (and the nurse refused to contact him). I threw up most of the way home and for the better part of the day. I realize some of the effect might not have been Demerol_ but the fact remains that a second dose post-op made me even sicker. I know it works well for some people_ but PLEASE ask your doctor to have a backup analgesic order if this makes you sick. NO ONE should have to throw up after any s,,F,41,2  days,4/10/2008,Demerol

The nurse comes back and gives me a shot of Demerol in the behind.  After a few minutes_ a crazy rush of heat hits me.  It's like someone turned up the temperature to 130 degrees in the room.  Immediately thereafter_ a wave of nausea overcomes me and I pass out. Though I suppose it sounds ""interesting"" in retrospect_ the next couple hours were a confusing and dizzying mix of reality and what I can only describe as insanity.

51, 5, Double C4 fracture_ post MVA,Euphoria_ drowsiness,I was sent home with oral demerol after a broked neck and major surgery following a car accident. I had been on IV push morphine in the hospital. The demerol was excellent at taking away my pain. It actually enduced a feeling of euphoria that was much welcomed considering all the pain I was in. It did make me a little sleepy_ but this was probably related to the fact that I was so happy to have my pain level decreased and feel like I could finally sleep. Im told long term use can result in the acumulation of a toxic metabolite that can result in seizures. This is why you dont see it used often for chronic (i.e. cancer) pain unless there is a specific need such as allergies to other drugs.

It was very hard to urinate_ although this may have been more about having to pee in that stupid jug than a side effect of the demerol.  I wouldn't say it really took the pain away as much as it made me forget about the pain.,As stated before_ I broke the bones in my ankle and required surgery to place plates and screws around the break.
