0, 1, Heart Bypass Surgery,kidney failure requiring dialysis 3 days a week_ arterial fibrillation_ anemia_ and congestive heart failure,"My daddy was given trasylol after his heart bypass surgery and now has kidney failure requiring dialysis 3 days a week. He NEVER had kidney problems before being given this drug. He was in good health aside from needing bypass surgery. Now_ he also has arterial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. He has been in and out of the hospital for months now and I feel Trasylol has robbed him of his quality of life. I feel like Bayer Corp. is killing my father and I believe there are many who don't even know their problems are due to Trasylol. I know we didn't until someone told us to look it up. This drug is STILL on the market despite the proven harmful effects and FDA warnings and will probably injure many more people if nothing is done about it. Apparently health ""care"" is just an oxymoron and all that matters in this industry is big money. What a crock! Something must be done about this!",F,33, ,7/26/2007,Trasylol
