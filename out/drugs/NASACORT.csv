2, 1, Allergies,Increased anxiety_ rapid heart rate_ light headed when standing.,Started taking this b/c I noticed flonase was not really helping.  This seemed to work better until I noticed some weird things happening.  The one that stands out the most is rapid heart beat.  Then it would have to be the light headed when standing and then anxiety.  Also my neck feels swollen.  I tapered off to just twice a week and the symptoms went away.  I noticed my allergies really bad one day and started back taking it everyday and the symptoms returned.  Will be going off and trying some sort of pill for allergies.  I'd say give it a shot but be wary of your body and what it tells you about this med.,M,45,3  months55mcg 1X D,7/11/2016Email,Nasacort

10, 1, To clear up congestion from virus,Increased congestion and runny nose_ sore irritated throat_ headache_ body aches_ weight loss_ dry mouth_ increased heartburn and stomach upset_ burning eyes_ catch viruses really easily_ makes any existing viral infection worse_ agitation/anxiety_ low mood_ emotional,I've tried it a few times now. Each time I get the same side effects. Then when I stop it I feel better and like me again. Don't take it when you have a virus. It made my virus worse. Made my nasal passages swell shut/severe congestion. It also makes me catch other viruses more easily. Some people are just more sensitive to steroids than others I think even at the lower dosages. I took it to clear up congestion from bad virus but it made my congestion and symptoms worse. I'd rather have a severely congested nose and drink milk shakes until I can breathe normally again than take this.,F,38,1  weeks 2X D,2/12/2016,Nasacort

This whole week I have been trying to figure out what was causing all of my seemingly unrelated symptoms and I am shocked to realize it was the nasacort! I am really disappointed because it really cleared up my allergy symptoms! I normally take Zyrtec but the cedar was so high_ it wasn't enough. Ugh! Just grateful I did not start to have anxiety as that is something I am prone to. I have been more emotional. Could be from worrying about all of the other weird symptoms! :(,F,41,6  days55 mcg,1/30/2016,Nasacort

15, 1, For Severe Congestion,Rapid heartbeat_ severe nausea_ feeling faint_ panic attacks_ severe anxiety_ nervousness_ complete loss of appetite_ chest felt heavy_couldn't stop pacing the floors_ ended up in the hospital.,Ended up in ER_ and was told it was just a sinus infection..was given an injection of antibiotics and was told to take benadryl_ sent home. Got worse_ congestion was not as bad_ but all the rest of the side effects increased and stayed and remained for four days. On the fifth day_ was not as bad. Following Sunday_ a week to the day_ ended up in ER again; panic attacks_ psychosis_ paranoia was extremely_ had never suffered from the above before I took Nasacort. Was kept over night did all types of blood work found nothing wrong with my blood or anything. Everything came out normal. Was diagnosed with severe anxiety_ because all tests came back negative for anything else. Was put on ativan to treat anxiety. Still suffer from anxiety_ the Ativan only takes off a little bit of the edge_ I've lost six pounds in a week..and I still feel ill_ appetite isn't 100%.

16, 4, To open my sinuses.,I occasionally experience diziness and then I cut back on the dosage.,I've tried Nasonex_ Flonase_ and Nasacort. All three are very similar and of course Nasacort has the best pricing. If I don't take a cortisteroid I develop sinus headaches so I try to manage them with this type of drug. Overall it has been a good solution but your body might not agree. Good luck!,M,53,150  days 1X D,12/15/2015,Nasacort

18, 3, nasal congestion,Used nasacort for awhile_ then the anxiety started slowly  but increased in intensity to the point i could not relax at all and felt high anxiety daily. The began to have a chronic tickle in my throat that would make me cough all day. Also had to go to the eye dr as i started to see flashing lights in my left eye. Nasacort worked for my congestion_ but not great. Going back on claratin. I was feeling worse with all the side effects as time went on.,Bad side effects over time.,F,58,6  weeks1 x,11/10/2015,Nasacort
19, 1, blocked ears,Severe anxiety and never before panic attacks. I thought I was losing my mind. Cardiologist and ENT didn't make the correlation_ and the allergist said it was safe. Primary care doctor put me on ativan and prescription for zoloft  (which I thankfully didn't take). I finally figured it out and stopped taking the nasacort 3 weeks ago. No more racing heart and anxiety is much better. This should carry a big warning and doctors should be more aware of these side effects.,Works great on allergies_ but definitely not worth it!,,52,6  months1xday,10/31/2015,Nasacort

23, 4, Nasal congestion,I feel slightly hyper and it's a little hard to concentrate on my work.  I also feel slightly_ slightly anxious and irritable.,I wanted something to open my sinus passages.  The sinus membranes were swollen making it difficult to breathe_ but I had no drainage.  This happens to me often due to allergies.  The first day I sprayed one dose in each nostril.  My sinuses cleared up fairly quickly_ but I started to experience a hyperactive feeling.  The next morning I decided to spray one dose in one nostril so I could have some of the benefits without suffering from insomnia_ since I had read that some people have insomnia with this medicine.  This morning I sprayed one dose in the other nostril.  My nasal passages are fairly clear_ but I feel hyper and I hope I'll be able to sleep tonight.  I think I'm going to wait a few days before using any more nasacort.  If my sinuses get blocked again_ I think I'll follow the same process I just outlined.,F,49,3  days 1X D,9/17/2015Email,Nasacort

25, 1, Clogged nose at night.,I started Nasacort three days ago.  The same day I started it_ my left eye felt like it had sand in it.  It was very painful and relieved by some eye drops.  I have never suffered from dry eye before_ so I have to attribute it to the Nasacort.  I see I am not the only one who reacted this way.  The Nasacort did help to make the swelling go down in my nasal passages_ but it is NOT worth the eye pain it caused.  I will be stopping it today!,,F,67,3  days2 sprays 1X D,9/4/2015,Nasacort
26, 1, Seasonal Allergies,I am so thankful to finally read there are other people having side effects to Nasacort. I am just starting to put 2 and 2 together that possibly this could be the reasons of my stomach issues which I have been experiencing?? I started having diarrhea problems in March which that is when I began using Nasacort_ however never thought it was the nasal spray because I had just recuperated from being sick for a month with a viral infection ...I use the spray at bedtime_ which my ENT recommended to do.  I also get a  scratchy throat and cough after dose_ headaches _ tooth pain_  ringing in the ears_ heartburn_ indigestion_  belching _upper and lower abdominal upsets. The worst is the  watery diarrhea within 8 hours after using. I also read more about the side effects and I am stopping the Nasacort as of today and going back to using Allegra or Claritin which aren't as effective but seem safer than Nasacort.  Who would have thought a nasal spray could cause so many side effects especially in,Nasacort does clear up my allergic reactions. Was a relief to not have excessive  sneezing_ runny nose_ watery or itchy eyes.  HOWEVER the side effects are too many and very concerning so I am discontinuing using it.  I am seeing a Gastro Dr soon because my stomach issues have become worse over time. I am hoping the side effects didn't cause permanent damage ?  I DO NOT recommend taking this medicine.,F,64,5  months55 mcg 1X D,8/18/2015,Nasacort

28, 3, Seasonal allergies,I started having severe nosebleeds the second year of taking Nasacort.  I cut back to 110 mcg per day and then quit taking it altogether but am still having nosebleeds.

29, 1, Clogged Nose,insomnia_ vomiting_ vertigo_ psychosis (loss of self)_ numbness_ shortness of breath_ anxiety_ panic attack_ fever_ mood swings,This sh* is horrible. I would not recommend it even on my enemy.I thought I was dying one night. I actually had brief thoughts of suicide. I was thinking to myself -- God_ this is what it is like. First off_ I was using Nasacort while I was interviewing for a job. Thus_ I thought the anxiety and stress was from the job. When I got the job_ which I dreamed of_ I wasn't so happy_ and I was still stressed. For the month I was using the drug_ I suffered fever as well as vertigo. I threw up 6 times after only 3 beers --- I knew something was off. Currently_ I am experiencing numbness_ but I remain optimistic that it will subside soon. Definitely threw Nasacort in the garbage.I think because I naturally suffer from shortness of breath_ the Nasacort opened my lungs and worked as prescribed. However_ I was so used to breathing a certain way that when I took Nasacort_ I felt a shortness of breath_ and it felt like I was not taking complete breaths.,M,26,1  months55 1X D,6/30/2015,Nasacort

But otherwise it works super fast and breaks up/ relives more sinus inflammation than anything I've ever used. It's literally like opening the flood gates! It even gives my sinus's a chance to repel that deep down infective material that causes headaches and pains.

Nasacort did wonders! I could breathe out of my nose and was not sneezing all of the time. But about a week into taking the medication_ I developed a very persistent cough that would not let up and audible wheezing. The symptoms were worse at night making it hard to sleep.

58, 1, airborne allergies,Upon stopping nasacort after 3 months of daily use_ to give myself a break from it_I developed withdrawal symptoms. I became anxious_ panicky. After a few days felt like my organs were swollen. Muscles of abdomen_rib cage_ and back stiff and very sore with frequent fleeting sharp pains. Stomach irritated and painful. Bladder sensitive. Abdomen bloated. Thought something serious was wrong with me_ but realized there had to be an explanation. Realized it was steroid withdrawal_ especially after reading similar stories on this site. Now getting itchy all over. While using nasacort had daily vague nausea_ dizziness_ and noticed I was becoming more short tempered.,While I was initially thrilled with the wonderful relief of my nasal allergy symptoms_ I am more concerned with what this steroid is doing to my body_ and won't use it anymore.,F,54,3  months2spray/day,1/6/2015Email,Nasacort

61, 4, Allergies/Sinuses,Nose bleeds and dry nasal passages,I've used nasacort since I was a teenager_ it's always been effective for my hay fever. In the winter I use it occassionally in combination with Simply Saline. Simply Saline usually keeps my sinuses clear but if I feel allergies act up I give nasacort a day or two to do it's job and i'm go again! I do experience really dry nasal passages in the winter and nose bleeds if I don't use simply saline consistently with it!,,29,  1X D,12/2/2014Email,Nasacort

69, 4, Unbearable hay fever,Immune system suppression,I have used Nasacort off and on for years_ first as prescription and recently as OTC. It is the only medication that truly relieves my unbearable hay fever. Not even allergy shots with antihistamines worked as well. But for me_ it has a very serious side effect of suppressing my entire immune system. - I come down with more viruses (colds). Sores such as from biting my tongue and dermal cuts take a long time to heal. I also will get candida infections (thrush) if I stay on this medication too long. I find I can cut back the dosage to a spray once every few days to once per week once the worst of my hay fever subsides. I like Loratadine (Claritin) as a constant med.

I started getting really random sore muscles in my rib cage_ back and abdomen.  I also had very high anxiety and emotions.  Because of these side effects_ and because the sinus issues were better_ I dropped my dosage down to 2 puffs a day from 8 puffs a day.  What resulted has been a very scary steroid withdrawal process.  I suddenly lost all muscle strength_ painful joints_ pins and needles_ dizziness_ and nausea.  The prescribing Dr. and my GP did not believe it could be from coming off of the Nasonex_ and ordered me all kinds of tests to rule out a bunch of frightening diseases.

I had a bad headache before taking it and the drug prolonged it I was laid out for a month thinking I had a virus. With such a bad headache I forgot to take it for a couple of days. My headache nearly disappeared. Took it on the third day and the headache and it's intensity returned within 5 minutes. Additionally_ this stuff has really messed up my stomach.

Just keep sniffing until all of it goes up the nasal cavity.  I'm very sensitive to oral steroids_ but the other nose sprays just didn't work.  OTC sprays have a bad rebound effect.  The menthol gels work well to keep things loose if I'm dried out inside my nose.  Nasacort does cause recurring nose bleeds.  I only take it 1X instead of 2X per day.  I also alternate days whenever possible_ instead of daily dosing.  I go off it completely when the weather is moist and warm.   Nasacort AG helps the mucus to soften and drain like normal people who do not have rhinitis.  I use Nasacort_ guaifenesin pills and cough syrup_ nasal gels when it's truly necessary_ and vaporizers in the winter when the weather is cold and dry.  Calcium lactate from health food stores is also great because it causes involuntary muscles to relax that often cause constriction and asthma attacks.  It has a very sedating effect_ so I take it at night.  No one drug can do it all with me.

Although I don't take it daily_ just when needed_ I noticed on the fourth week I took this med I experienced an intense headache for several days in my forehead. Throughout the course of the month I also felt very emotional_ (crying for no reason).

131, 1, multiple sinus infections,Within minutes I had a headache.  Later that night I woke in the night with a very sick stomache.  I ended up throwing up and having diarhea for the night and most of the next day.  It is so much more miserable to be sick with flu like symptoms than to have a headache.  Very miserable!!!!,,F,37,1  days,8/27/2009,Nasacort
132, 1, allergic rhinitis,Using only 1 spray per nostril once daily_ I experienced nasty headaches. When I discontinued Nasacort AQ_ they stopped.,,F,58,6  days,7/10/2009,Nasacort
133, 5, Nasal congestion,None!,I used Nasacort AQ for nasal congestion and felt relief within the first few hours. I used to use Afrin_ and hated the irritation_ dry throat_ nasty taste_ and rebound effect. Nasacort felt clean_ fresh_ and didn't drip down my throat. I tried other sprays but the alcohol dried out my nose_ and I didn't like the way some smelled and tasted.,F,32,8  days,6/24/2009,Nasacort
134, 2, Swollen sinuses,First two days_ I felt O.K. and noticed very little watering of my eyes and drainage into my throat; however_ after those two days_ I felt cloudiness in my thinking and low in spirit.

Manufacturer's info sheet says Nasacort is 8 times more potent than prednisone!  I had terrible withdrawal symptoms for several days after using Nasacort for just 3 days.  The doctors will say none of this is possible with nasal sprays.  The med. actually drips down the throat and into the stomach where it is apparently absorbed. 'Very bad stuff.,M,57,3  days,4/29/2009,Nasacort

Used it again some last year and had headaches_ but didn't link it to this.  Then I used it this year for 2 weeks and had the full blown problems listed. Thought it was a sinus or dental problem.  Have had x-rays_ CT_ doctor & dentist visits and stopped using it during that time. The problems subsided and the day after I started using it again they came back. Stopped using it and the side effects have subsided again.  It's too bad since it worked great on my runny nose and coughing_ but I can't live with feeling like I've had a stroke or am doing permanent damage to myself.,F,48,2  weeks,4/4/2009,Nasacort

141, 4, allergic rhinitis,None so far,I have used this product 3 times total and for the past 2 days. I have outdoor_ indoor and food allergies_ especially to milk_ cheese etc. Lately I have been experiencing some bad attacks of allergic rhinitus with sinus pain being the predominant symptom which is felt in all 4 of my sinuses. I feel the product helped somewhat but only helped in the nasal area and not deeper in my sinuses. Usually when I have an attack I have to let it go it's course which is 2 to 3 days. From reading these reviews I will definitely be careful not to over use this product.,F,44,2  days,1/2/2009,Nasacort
142, 1, sinus infection and fluid in ear,fullness and pressure in the ears and throat_ headaches_metallac taste in my mouth_ and joint pain,I will not take this again.  The side effects are far greater than any benefit.,F,58,2  weeks,11/24/2008,Nasacort
143, 1, allergies/plugged sinuses,Headaches everyday_ extremely sore neck_ anxiety and uncontrollable twitching eye lid(probably from the anxiety)and getting worse each day,The first day I used this med. it helped me breath much better but as the week has gone on the side effects are overwhelming.  I feel like I aged 5 years in the last week and I'm sore all over.  The eyelid twitching has gotten out of control.  The first few days it would only happen once and hour or so but now it is almost non-stop.  I researched this and it says it is most likely caused by stress.  HUMMMM... I feel like I have to be doing something at every minute of the day_ this must be while I feel like I have uncontrolled anxiety built up.  I also have had a non-stop headache since I started taking this medicine to the point that I have to take some extra strenght motrin each day to cope with it.  I will stop using this med. and see if I start to feel like myself again.,F,36,8  days,11/24/2008,Nasacort

148, 3, allergies,Anxiety,Not certain it was Nasacort because taking Allegra also; but after reading comments_ I feel more certain it is the Nasacort.

I feel a little anxious in the morning_ but more so about an hour after inhaling.,M,48,2  months,8/28/2007Email,Nasacort
149, 1, Seasonal Allergies,Anxiety_ panic attacks (at night)_ slight depresssion_ just not myself_ Former aches in joints returned_ agitated.,I never would have connected the medication to these symptoms.

Did I mention the joint pain? It seems as though every ache I've ever had has come back all at once. Then there is the depression. Not too bad_ but I definitely do not feel like myself since I began this treatment.,If this is what I am to expect from other allergy medicines then I think I would rather suffer the bad effects of the allergies themselves.,M,50,90  days,1/15/2007,Nasacort

155, 4, Seasonal allergies,More prone to VERY slight nosebleeds; mild stimulant effects in the first week of treatment which made it more difficult to sleep.,Compared to the horrible side effects of Flonase_ Nasacort really seems like a good choice.

Nasacort was prescribed; it did more damage to my lungs_ caused severe nosebleed and I ended up with infection which would not clear up and after two months_ I was diagnosed with leukemia_ with white cell count of 224_000.
