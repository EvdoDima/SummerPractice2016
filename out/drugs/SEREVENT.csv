0, 3, severe asthma,First time ever in life could breath clearly_ wonderful for asthma.After 16 years on it learned something that made me seriously consider experimenting going off. Three days out and horrible crippling arthritic type pain and other symptoms leaving me. So sad...didnt know all these years thats why I FELT so old. Am looking into alternative cuz like others here...am now overly reactive all the time.,I feel long b.a. NOT an acceptable trade off for good health. Be very careful and DO NOT let docs dismiss you. Best wishes.,F,47,10  years50mcg,10/26/2015Email,Serevent
1, 1, Asthma,Palpitations_ arrhythmia_ 'heavy chest',I have tried this medicine twice.  On both occasions I had palpitations - something I have never had before.   Second occasion stopped taking med on a Sunday. Woke up 6am Monday with an incredibly irregular pulse - very frightening and phoned NHS direct.  They said it was 'unlikely' to be drug and to go to emergency which I did.  After waiting there for almost an hour my symptoms were getting less.  ECG was normal_ BP much higher than usual at 160/90.  Hospital doctor however detected a 'heart murmur' and said I needed referral to a cardiologist_ but that I would need my GP to do this.Saw my GP that afternoon.  He also said it was unlikely to be Serevent.  Checked my heart.  No detectable murmur.  He called in a senior practice doctor to check - again_ no detectable murmur.  Now almost a week later_ no problems_ pulse and heart back to feeling normal.  'Heavy chest' much better and BP down to 132/74.  Whilst this drug is very effective at controlling asthma_ I would be very_ very careful.  I am quite confident that my symptoms were the result of this drug and they were extremely unpleasant.  If you have any tendency to heart arrythmia or high blood pressure I would just say no to this one.,M,55,3  days25 mcg 2X D,6/28/2012Email,Serevent
2, 5, asthma,better than advair....I took serevent in conjunction wit6h flovent and my breathing was perfect....I do not have great improvement with advair,my doctor only has samples of advair and I cannot afford to buy serevent and flovent every month because I do not have health coverage,F,62,10  years 2X D,2/19/2010,Serevent
3, 1, chest infection with breathing prob,Was rushed into hospital with racing and erratic heartbeat following severe chest and back pain radiating into jaw.,After my MOT the health centre nurse said that it was unlikely I would ever have heart problems. A couple of weeks later_ after 3 months of using Serevent prescribed by GP and put on repeat prescription I experienced very severe pains all around my chest and back and radiating up into my jaw. I thought I might be having a heart attack so went to the health centre and was given an ECG which revealed that I had an extremely fast and erratic heart rate - something which has never occurred before. Was given an aspirin and fast-tracked into hospital wher I remained for one and a half days while tests were carried out which showed that I had not had a heart attack. One month later and after three different types of medication_ the first two of which I was allergic to_ I still have a very rapid and erratic heart rate. I was alerted to Serevent side effects by a friend and looked them up on the net and found that it had been ranked the fifth most dangerous drug in the States and had caused deaths. It is also renowned for causing a rapid and erratic heart rate_ so I would not advise anyone to take it. It had no noticeable effect on my asthma. Why is it not banned in the UK?,F,66,3  months,1/3/2010Email,Serevent
4, 4, Asthmatic,I dont think I've ever experienced any side effects from this medicine. I take about 100micrograms of it a day through a spacer to control my asthma. It was prescribed after I had an attack_ I think its helped my asthma alot_ Im not taking my ventilin as much as I was before_ and I've been able to excersie and run around alot easier. I keep a peak flow diary and make constant notes about how my chest is. Just in case.,Im British_ this was prescribed to me in the UK_ the doctor warned me that it DOES hold side effects and to get in touch if/when it starts to interfear with me.,F,18,3  months,11/6/2009,Serevent
5, 1, Bronchitis/Asthma,It seemed to help at first_ but after 5 days it felt like I was breathing through a pillow.  I could move air and was oxygenating okay....but I had an increasing feeling of suffocation.  The ED doctor's blew me off because I was NOT wheezing.  They thought it was all in my head.  After I stopped the Severent these weird side effects slowly dissapated.,,F,43,5  days,11/1/2009,Serevent

7, 1, Asthma,I had moderate asthma controlled by Aerobid before I was placed on this. When I started taking it I got weight gain_ cramping_ anxiety attacks_ and over the years it led to severe heart palpitations with my HR being in the 170's. I have been admitted into the hospital numerous times for tachycardia caused after taking one dose of the 250/50 advair. I have after 3-4 years weaned myself onto just 220 mg flovent 2X a day. I find my asthma is much worse than it was prior to starting the advair and the serevent is to blame due to it worsens asthma. I'd avoid this drug and I hope my lung sensitivity clears up. Despite 220mg flovent every 12 hours I am still taking my albuterol once a day_ and sometimes more.,AVOID THIS DRUG,F,26,4  years,3/17/2009,Serevent

9, 5, Emphysema,No side effects,Advair has been my life line.  I have been given several other products_ such as Spiriva etc.  For me_ this is the only medicine that has opened up my breathing system.  I wish this product would help others as it has helped me.  I know there are FDA hearings on the drug and I am paniced that it may be taking off the market.,F,67,2  years,12/13/2008,Serevent
10, 5, asthma,None,Serevent has been a godsend.  Before I had to have albuteral every 4 hours plus a steroid inhaler.  Becsuse it has such a short duration I was waiting until I could have more. Plus I had the jitters so much that I had to hold things with two hands.  With the 12 hour lasting ability of Serevent I can eliminate the steroid and there are no jitters.  Only rarely have I needed an Albuterol inhaler.,M,82,15  years,12/11/2008Email,Serevent
11, 1, Asthma,It gave me ulcers_ digestive problems_ and when I quit taking it my Asthma went right back to it's same status: bad. I am just taking flovent now in hopes it helps. I also would get severe anxiety attacks and palpitations which led me several times into the ER.,It's a scary medication don't even take it. I am afraid for my life since I took this thing.,F,25,1  years,8/5/2008,Serevent
12, 1, Asthma,I experienced very dangerous side effects while taking Advair - the Advair Diskus.  I experienced the following specific side effects: significantly increased propensity to experience asthma attacks_ sometimes almost immediately following taking the medication; dizziness; headaches; muscle weakness; lightheadedness; feeling like I'm going to faint; and general disorientation.  Advair is particularly dangerous because the FDA has acknowledged that it causes death in some cases_ and the FDA is currently reviewing the drug's side effects relating to children.,My doctor prescribed this medication for asthma without informing me of the side effects or the ongoing FDA investigation.  I am a 30 year-old male_ and clearly the side-effects affect adults and not merely children.  This is a particularly dangerous drug because it masks the onset of an asthma attack - you don't realize it until the attack hits you.  There are documented cases of individuals found dead holding the Advair medication in hand.,M,30,3  weeks,7/30/2008,Serevent
13, 1, Emphysema_ restricted air passages,"I took Advair for about 5 months.  It did not seem to help my breathing any. (I have always been short of ""wind."" Never could run or do extended exercise.) It did however end up by leaving me almost totally crippled with pain all over my body.  The problem eased immediately after ceasing the use of Advair.  My lung man says_ ""Advair does not cause pain.""  Doctors know so little about the stuff they push.  I do continue to have numbness in my feet and weakness in my legs from the hips down.  Whether these two problems are related we will never know.",I did spend considerable money on this product as my Plan D prescription plan fell into the doughnut hole.,M,78,5  months,1/13/2008Email,Serevent
14, 5, For asthma.,The only side effect I have (been taking it for about 15 yrs.) is when I have a few drinks it gives me a strange feeling in my chest.,I would not like to be taken off Serevent as it has controlled my asthma completely.  I hardly have to use Ventolin anymore.,F,60,15  years,9/20/2007,Serevent
15, 1, Participant in phase 3 testing,Intensely worsening asthma attacks (which was reported at the time_ but my concerns did not make it onto the sheet included with the serevent (n=246ish).  Maybe I wasn't in the testing phase I thought I was.  Testing done in DC.  Anyway_ the damn drug nearly killed me.  I was a trooper_ if I may say so modestly_ and finished out the entire months long participation.  I was one of the oldest participants at the time_ in my 40s and always wondered if my results were due to my age.  Many of the participants were in college.  The testing was done at a private MDs office_ literally a few feet from American University's main parking lot.  I have always felt that this might have skewed the research.  Anyway_ enough grumblings.  If you take this medication_ just pay REALLY close attention to the severity of your attacks.  Keep a journal_ if your attacks or tightening in your chest begins to worsen_ go running back to your MD for advice. (Also_ keep a rescue inhaler_ e.g. Ventolin_ with you at,,M,57,90  days,4/18/2007,Serevent
16, 5, exercise induced broncospasms,none,Taken 45 min to 1 hour before activity and I can go full tilt with no respiratory limitations at all. Did a bicycling trial using the same route one day without Serevent then the next day with it. What a difference...all the gasping_ coughing_ whistling and wheezing was gone.,F,43,2  years,3/26/2007,Serevent
17, 1, Asthma,Heart palpitations_ anxiety_ sleeplessnes.,I have stopped taking the medication nearly 2 months ago. I am still hypersensitive to ANY stimuli. My doctor has me on medication for anxiety. The symptoms have reduced somewhat since I got off the medicine but I am really concerned what the long term results are going to be. I did mention to my allergist when he put me on it that I had been sensitive to stimulants in the past. He said everything would be ok and that I would get used to it in a couple of weeks. At first I was just jittery and then I started waking up at night with a racing heart. Finally over the Christmas holidays it just sent me into the stratosphere. I would be VERY careful taking this medicine if you have had problems with stimulants in the past!,M,38,3  months,3/5/2007,Serevent

20, 4, Asthma/Chronic bronchitis,Slight hand cramps and foot cramps_ 3-4 times since starting medication almost two weeks ago,I never realized just how poor my lung condition was until I started taking this.  Only this year had I finally been prescribed an inhaler for my yearly winter bronchitis (it got so bad_ I had to go to hospital)_ and it made a major difference.  My doctor put me on the Advair discus for this winter to try to prevent the bronchitis_ and I immediately noticed an overall improvement in my breathing ability. In addition_ I haven't needed to use my inhaler when walking up hills outside in the cold or during/after any intense activity since starting the Advair.  I also haven't had serious reactions when exposed to cigarette smoke - before using Advair_ I'd almost immediately start wheezing.  Having never had an actual asthma attack_ my case is mild_ but the Advair really helps a lot.  My coughs have been more productive and less painful since I started the medication_ too.  The cramps concern me slightly_ but I hope I can continue to use the medication_ as it really makes such a difference.,F,21,10  days,11/30/2006Email,Serevent
21, 2, cough_ shortness of breath,I was taking Advair. It seemed to help at first.  It reduced my episodes of shortness or breath and coughing. It was prescribed by a cardio-pulmonologist. He never diagnosed me as asthmatic despite my symptoms.  After I had been taking Advair for about six months_ I did develop severe muscle cramps all over my body.  In the last six months the cough and shortness of breath got worse. It was suggested that I might have  sulfite sensitivity.  Since eliminating the major sources of sulfites my cough and congestion significantly improved_ but I still had shortness of breath with exercise.  Twelve hours after  discontinuing the Advair_ my cough further diminished_  I am not clearing my throat as much and my chest pain and palpitations have gone away.  I still experience some shortness of breath when I go from inactive to moving.,I am concerned that doctor's are not asking the right questions before prescribing this medication,F,58,4  years,11/1/2006,Serevent
