0, 5, Hyperadrenal/cushingoid/exhaustion,Headache_ nausea_ if bad enough leads to vomitting,This drug WILL give you headache_ artery aches (like in the neck) and nausea. Its better to deal with it if you can lie down_ but that menas you have to be in bed all day for as long as you take it. I tried a better way of working with the side effects_ which was to take Ibuprofen for the headaches and that does stop them! Also_ I take a very small dose of (less-drowsy formula) dramamine a few minutes before taking the dose_ and I also can avoid the nausea. I would rather continue with this drug because it is the only thing I can do to tame my overactive adrenals. That condition bothers me more than this drug does_ so I dont mind having to take a few steps to fix my adrenal overactivity.I have only been on this a few days I will come back to post if anything else shows up.,F,24,4  days,6/30/2008,Ketoconazole
1, 1, fungal infection (skin),Horrible stomach pain and nausea,I stopped this after 3 days because the side effects were getting worse. I will never take this again.,F,30,3  days,11/27/2004,Ketoconazole
