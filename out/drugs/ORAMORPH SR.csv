0, 2, I have degenerative disk disease.,Severe constipation!,I take 30mg. 5 times per day but the option for the #5 wasn't listed. As the years pass my pain gets worse & worse. This medicine doesn't work very well. It helps a very little bit. my pain raiting is 6 to 7 daily (while on my meds.) yet my doctor will not change my meds.! Also I am on the immediate release tabs_ not the timed release. I would like to be on something that works BETTER without having to take so many pills! There are several other meds. that I have to take every day in adition to these. So if you know of something that works better without taking so many pills please let me know. Also I am concerned with what all of these pills are doing to my internal organs. My doc. never tests me for that he only tests me to make sure that I am not taking more than 5 per day or drugs that are not prescribed to me_ which is something that I have never done!,F,48,8  years30mg 6X D,4/27/2010Email,Oramorph sr
1, 5, chronic SEVERE pain,I was started on codeine in 1984 and progressed through vicodin_ percocet_ then to Oramorph which I am on now. I have had no adverse effects. One time the VA sent me MS Contin instead of Oramorph and it did not work as well.  I had to take immediate release morphine to get ANY pain relief.,I hope I do not continue to have difficulties getting Oramorph;  the MS Contin worked on me more like a placebo and I was in constant severe pain.,M,61,1  years,2/20/2007,Oramorph sr
