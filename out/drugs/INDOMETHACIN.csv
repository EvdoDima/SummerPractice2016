3, 5, Gout,No side effects whatsoever. Even took it on an  empty stomach.,I finally figured out I have Gout_ the P.A. prescribed Indomethacin. This basically cured my gout in my foot in like 3 days. I feel like this medicine is a godsend! In the past w/o any pain meds I would be bedridden due to foot pain for like 2 weeks before I could walk again.

12, 5, Originally for Knee surgery in 1995,I have had no side effects whatsoever. Just lucky_ I guess,I originally began taking Indo after a big time knee surgery in 1995 since over-the-counter drugs were not helping with pain management during recovery. I have been playing baseball(hardball) since that surgery almost every weekend_ sometimes two games and Indo really helps with any minor pain that I would experience. This year my left hip went kablooey_ and will require replacement_ but will not be scheduled for a few months. I am continuing to play but could not with the hip pain unless I took my Indo the night before. For me_ it is indispensable! I'm sure that I will need it during my hip replacement recovery.,M,65,20  years50 MG x 2 1X AN,8/5/2015,Indomethacin
13, 2, Extreme pain due to infected tooth,Sick stomach_ dizziness_ mild confusion_ needing to use washroom more,I wouldn't recommend using this drug_ I've used very strong pain killers before (such as codeine_ morphine_ and several others) but this one hasn't even curbed my pain. I've had to cancel all my plans for today to wait for the antibiotics I'm also taking to kick in. Pain is next to unbearable_ and I've taken 2 Advil extra strength liquid capsules which have just now kicked in and made me able to drink some water without wanting to cry. I've been using clove oil also_ but the pain is very persistent. I'm going to the dentist in a month and getting the tooth taken out_ but he said I need to have an antibiotic treatment before then. I don't believe the walk-in doctor exactly knew what he was giving me_ because he took a few moments before writing it down and giving it to me. Hopefully it kicks in_ but he said within 15 minutes of taking it I should be feeling the effects....nothing yet and it's been 2_ almost 3 hours. Very dissatisfied and I wish I was able to get in to see my regular doctor today. Hopefully I'll be able to catch some sleep tonight.,F,16,7  days50 MG,7/27/2015,Indomethacin

15, 2, Gout,Uncontrollable racing & pounding heart beat_ extreme dizziness & nausea.  Felt as if I was in a thick fog.,First ever bout with gout.  Took 25mg Indomethacin at bedtime with a Tramadol for pain. The Tramadol helped me sleep comfortably so may not have been aware of any Indomethacin side effects.  Swelling and pain was reduced in the morning.  In the afternoon_ took another Indomethacin while awake_ within an hour_ my heart began racing uncontrollably and was experiencing extreme dizziness.  When your heart begins racing and pounding uncontrollably and your head is spinning... it's extremely scary and nerve wracking.  Nearly called 911 as I thought I was having a heart attack due to the medicine  The on & off extreme rapid heart beat finally subsided after an hour.  Though it does relieve swelling & pain rather rapidly_ I'll never take this stuff again due to the horrendous side effects.,M,43,1  days25 2X D,7/15/2015,Indomethacin
16, 5, Gout,Dizziness,Taking for gout flare up. Works a lot better than Advil but makes me dizzy and that's not fun. Using colchicine to help with flare up and indo for swelling/minimal pain relief.

18, 1, Heel sour,Numbness of the face_ felt like someone had given me anesthesia_ like I was gonna pass out. Throat felt like it was closing up and tighting of the chest. I felt like I was losing my mind. Very afraid,I was driving home from work talking to my mom and telling her I didn't feel right then my face started getting numb. I hung up and called my husband and then told him about it and then my throat felt like it was closing up and I had a tighting in my chest. He immediately told me pull over now and call 911. I did but I felt foolish. They came and put me in the ambulance. They wanted to take me to the hospital but I decided to go home. I do remember the emt guy asking if I had ever had a panic attack. I said no cause I haven't. After reading all these reviews I realize I wasn't crazy it has happened to others with this drug. I'm sorry but after what I went through people need More warnings about this medicine! I can promise you I will Never Ever take this medicine again!! I have never been so scared. I thought I was gonna die.,F,48,1  days50mg,6/27/2015Email,Indomethacin

20, 3, Gout,The first time I took Indomethacin someone had to drive me home from work for blurry vision. During my last gout attack_ I took it on the weekend and spent a lot of time on the couch. My vision was off again and I could not concentrate on anything. The pain did go away and the bottle says only take for pain_ so I stopped after 2 days. I am taking Colchicine to control the gout now and only using the Indomethacin if I absolutely need it and not leaving the house.,,M,41,2  days25 MG 3X D,6/10/2015,Indomethacin
21, 2, Gout (Foot Inflammation),After the first dose with a moderately sized meal_ quite nauseous and and drowsy within an hour; had to lay down and ended up sleeping for about 2 hours; woke up with mild lightheaded feeling. 2nd dose was in the evening before bed_ so I think I likely slept through any side effects. Worked great for the gout pain in the morning of the next day (took pain from about a 7/10 to a 2/10) and so I didn't take any more doses on the 2nd day; though had a mild intermittent tingling feeling in limbs throughout the day. 3rd day morning_ pain had gone back up to about a 4/10_ so took another dose with breakfast cereal (light meal) and went into work. About 1.5 hours later_ became quite dizzy_ drowsy_ diarrhea_ anxious; decided to leave work and drive home when I probably shouldn't have. Upon getting home_ fell asleep on the couch for about an hour to sleep off the feelings; woke up feeling groggy.,Rating as a 2/5 because it did great at alleviating the gout pain / inflammation however the side effects were too debilitating.,M,29,3  days50 MG 2X D,6/5/2015,Indomethacin

24, 1, Hip Surgery,Head ache_ Breathing issues_ ringing in ears_ extreme anxiety/panic_ out of body experience_ Hot flashes_ Anger/ irritability,Everything was OK for the first few days then I awoke day 6 around 4 AM feeling anxious and having trouble breathing. I slept a few more hours on the couch sitting up. As that day progressed   I started to feel extremely hot_ early March with 4 feet of snow on the ground and I had windows open and my shirt off curled in a ball on the couch. It was a out of body experience like watching life as a movie but a scary movie. I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I could not cool off and I could not catch my breath. At one point I had  issues understanding how to use my cell phone and lights were too bright. it was sensory over load. I had unbelievable claustrophobia and all sorts of unexplained fear. Today is day 4 off of the medication_ each day is a little better with the help of some anxiety medication but I still have slight anxiety from time to time. I have had a panic attack before but it was nothing like this_ I thought I was losing my mind. As others have mentioned if you feel any of this it is defiantly the meds not you!

I think that if you are going to take this drug_ take it after a FULL meal at night because the side effects are not as bad as than if you take it with a small snack.,F,40,4  days50mg 3X D,2/2/2013Email,Indomethacin
59, 1, hemicrania continua & cluster hdach,lightheadedness_ palpitations_ drowsiness_ lethargy. blurred vision,Initially gave some relief to the hemicrania/cluster headache combo that I have with 1 25mg per day. That worked for a couple of weeks_ but eventually had to start increasing dosage to 3X/day and then I started with side effects; which now already outnumber the reason for initially taking it.   No stomach upset as I take Zegerid daily. I also had a nerve block injection to help relieve the daily pain. Neither the Indo nor the shot has worked. I still have the daily headaches. Could be the fact that headaches are still daily is also a side effect of the Indo so_ as of today_ I am going off the Indo since the side effects are mounting up. I will try a 2nd nerve block to see if it works without the Indo.,,68,45  days25 mg 3X D,12/10/2012Email,Indomethacin

Usually_ if I'm having a bad dream_ I can just make myself wake up. I really had to force myself and almost jumped out of bed trying to get away from this dream.",The swelling went down considerably the second day and my foot feels much better but I will no longer be taking this medication after my lunch dose.

Started out as feeling dizzy_ light headed_ then the urge to vomit_ but found it difficult to walk to the bathroom without the feeling the need for assistance to not collapse on the floor. Sat on the bathroom floor with my husband for 5-8 min_ explaining what I felt while trying to sidetrack myself to not vomit (never did vomit). It became increasingly difficult to communicate and breathe (felt chest pressure & as if I could only take half a breath) My hands_ whole body and face were becoming increasingly tingly_ numb & clammy. We called my obstetrician_ who assured my husband that I'll be fine (although I disagreed in my mind). Before I came to the point where I could no longer talk_ I told him we might need to call 911 if I give him the sign to do so. After that it was extremely difficult to stay conscious_ and understand what my husband was saying_ I think I replied in slur or barely at all. I gave him the sign to call for help. As paramedics came in to the house I don't recall much else_ other than I didn't understand what they were saying. Eventually I lost consciousness_ and went in to convulsions. While in the ambulance on oxygen I came to_ and felt very weak_ tired. In the ER I was told it was a panic attack.,F,28,1  times50 1X D,12/19/2011Email,Indomethacin

I've taken the advice from other posts and have always taken it directly after a full meal_ not snacks.  I've even pushed myself to eat more than a snack for a fear that I would experience what other people have.  Suprisingly_ I'm not drowsy but quite the opposite_ I cannot get to sleep.  When I do fall asleep_ I seem to be groggier in the morning.  As far as mood goes_ I've been dealing with a lot of depression lately and since taking this_ I've been in a really good mood.

75, 1, Gout,I just got out of the ER after 3 hours.  I took this medicine for gout_ promptly drank two cups of coffee_ and then 1 hour later went from being perfectly fine to slowly feeling detached from reality.  My heart began racing irregularly and I was pouring in sweat.  I grabbed my cell phone and couldn't remember how to operate it to make a call.  At this point I decided I needed to call 911 figuring something had happened inside my brain such as a busted blood vessel.  Mind you I'm 39 years old and never had any major health issues.  As I focused on dialing 911_ I noticed my hand started involuntarily shaking violently.  I then managed to dial 911 and then walked over to the door to open it up for the EMT as I didn't think I'd be conscious before they could get to me.  I then sat down focusing all my energy on not passing out.  The EMTs finally arrived and took me to ER where I was stabilized 3 hours later.

Originally my Rheumatologist prescribed 50 mg three times per day which was too much for my body.  The first week on this drug_ I had to call an ambulance because I thought I was having a heart attack or dying.  It turned out to be a panic attack from this drug.  We lowered the dosage to the minimum that still controls my inflammation/pain.

81, 4, Paroxysmal Hemicrania,Blood pounding through ears and head_ stiff neck_ canker sores (?)_ slight dizziness 10-15 minutes after taking pill,This medicine has drastically reduced the frequency of my horrible headaches_ but it does not block or fix smaller tension or stress headaches. When I first started this med. I would feel tightness in my chest for about 15 minutes_ and then it would relax. This doesn't happen anymore. Now_ I still sometimes have trouble with the sound and feeling of blood pulsing up into my head - very uncomfortable but usually goes away after I fall asleep_ though sometimes this takes a long time. I had about 2 months of chronic canker sores on gums and tongue_ but this may or may not have been caused by the drug_ I'm not sure. They aren't occurring right now and I'm still taking the med. Overall it has been helpful. When the big headaches come it blocks the majority of the pain_ but my body still goes through the headache so I still experience neck stiffness_ vision changes_ sensitivity to light and sound_ nausea and vomiting and the need to sleep for much longer than usual. I have also experienced some weight gain while on this drug because it must be taken with a meal_ not just a snack. I space out the times when I take it to cover as much of the waking day as possible_ so I wind up eating 6-7 small meals each day.

I do eat w/it_ but the side effects are a constant either way.,It works great for migraines ...especially since I've tried several medications for this disorder.

After 15 minutes of trying to concentrate on breathing and deciding whether or not to call 911_ I slowly made it 20 paces or so to unlock my door in case paramedics needed to enter my house.

I would at times feel sick in the stomach_ heart beating faster and also mild anxiety. I realised that the trick is to have a proper meal_ ie -  such as rolled oats_ with bannana and honey_ and then directly take the indomethacin straight after.  The same applies with lunch_ and dinner. I used to just have a glass of milk or a yogurt_ which resulted in the side effects. The way I see it_ is that if the medication is slowly released into your system by having a big meal underneath it_ I have no problems. I just had a terrible episode of gout for 3 weeks. My big toe and ankle looked deformed!and the pain!! I thought I would try natural alternatives - cherries_ cherrie juice_ celery seed in captule form_ different types of water_ lime juice_ lemon juice and nothing worked.

These side effects subsided around the 2 week mark.  I have to take Mylanta first or else I get stomach pain (from what I have read you want to protect your stomach and GI tract as much as possible when taking indomethacin.),I suffered from this rheumatological condition for around 2 years before finding his medication.  My symptoms went from very transient sacroiliac joint pain_ costocondritis_ and profound fatigue_ to constant sacroiliac pain and intense night pain in lumbar and_ later_ my thoracic spine accompanied by a kind of constant lower basline of fatigue (if you can call it that.) At least 2 days per week I would get bouts of intense fatigue probably from the inflammation in my body.  Which is why I was a bit worried about the fatigue that indocin caused for the first few doses but now that has gone_ and_ more importantly_ I haven't had any fatigue due to my illness since I began the medication.It is certainly a strong med and it seems like the kind of thing that should only be rx'd if needed but_ damn_ is it effective!  800mg of Ibuprofen or 750mg of Naproxen would only take away about 10% of my pain.  I even took muscle relaxers and tried a few pain killers and nothing worked like this stuff!  I take indomethacin daily_ one 75mg SR(slow release)dose after dinner at around 7pm.  It relieves 94% of my pain.  I can walk_ sit_ and lay down without being in pain or anticipating how painful it will be to move.  And_ oh yeah_ I can sleep again.  I get a full night's worth of restful sleep.  As long as I take mylanta 10 minutes before_ the only side effect that I have now is fantastic_ amazing relief!!!

102, 5, RA joint pain and inflammation,Nausea and mild dissociation. Went away with use.,Indomethacin is an NSAID so I don't know why it would cause dissociated feelings in people_ but here and with people I know_ it is fairly frequently reported. For my RA pain it's great. It brings down the swelling and pain_ starting within an hour after taking it. Rarely have I needed to take more than 2 per flare. It doesn't cut the mustard when my shoulder flares_ but it helps a little. For RA shoulder flares I have to add Vicodin.,F,50,1  years50mg 1X AN,8/21/2010Email,Indomethacin
103, 5, Gout_ arthritis_ tendinitis_,Light headed_ tiredness,I've been suffering arthritic like conditions since my early 20's as I am now 38.  I have very extreme cases of flare ups in all joints of my lower body as well as in my tendons.  I have been put on allopurinal for the gout as long term_ but still have many difficulties accomplishing daily activities.  Sometimes the pain is so severe it affects my whole body.  To me indomethacin is the only thing that works and works very well.  Within just an hour relief is felt.  AS long as a person is prescribed the correct amount and taken according to the directions it is the most effective solution for acute gout and arthritis sufferers.,M,38, 50mg 3X D,7/25/2010Email,Indomethacin

Just had a back injury with the pain down my left leg like it did when I rupured my disc doctor put me on steroids for 3 weeks with hydracodone for pain_ pain got better then a week later started to hurt again now am on indomethacin 50mg 3x day with a muscle relaxer at night and hydracodone for pain. I have never experienced headaches or dizzieness I work out after taking and so far no problems_ hope it works for my back as well as it does for my gout.(started having gout in ankle at age 28 didnt know why my ankle would hurt for about aweek then get better_ went on for 6 years before I was diagnosed with gout) steroids work great for gout fre ups too.,M,38,1  days75mg 1X D,6/10/2010Email,Indomethacin

115, 2, Bone bruise in foot,For the first two days I felt like this was a miracle pill.  The foot pain I was dealing with from a bone bruise was so horrible I could barely walk.   A few hours after taking this pill I could walk and the pain was nearly gone.  I took the pill for the next few days and felt incredible.  On the fourth day I was supposed to take the pills I woke up sweating_ vomited twice in 20 minutes and had a horrible throbbing migraine.  Over the course of the day i had shortness of breath felt dizzy while walking_ had a tingling sensation all over my body that was worse in my extremities and spent almost my whole day lying in bed. It is now the second day of not taking this drug and I woke up with the same headache and shortness of breath.  I have not vomited but am slighly less nauscious than yesterday.,This website was very helpful and made me less worried about the fact that I feel like a bag of mush.  I dont think that the few days of pain was worth these now days of sickness that will last for how long_ i'm not sure.  It seemed great at first but the side effects caught up with me an I am wasting a beautiful sunny weekend laying in bed feeling horrible instead of limping around on crutches.

It  felt so overwhelming that I was sure something horrible was happening...I was forgetting something important at work or something would happen to someone I cared about.  I couldn't concentrate on my work and needed to get up constantly.  I didn't start tying it to the drug until it began happening consistently every day around 1pm (two hours after I took the pill) and fading around 3:30.  I told my doctor I thought I was going crazy so she's given me a sample of celebrex instead.

I then went home and crashed for a couple of hours_ after which I felt better.,Lots of people tolerate indomethacin just fine- but if you're one of the ones who don't_ don't panic! Just realize that it is just a medicine side effect- you are NOT having a heart attack or a stroke!

138, 5, Ankylosing Spondylitis,I am 59 years old and have been taking Indomethacin for the past 25 years.  Indomethacin with the combination of two Darvocet N-100's control all of my pain and make me feel fairly close to normal.  My spine had completely fused from age 20 to age 40.  At age 40 I had bi-lateral hip replacement surgery and Indomethacin is the only NSAID that has worked for me personally.,I have never had any side effects until recently.  Two weeks ago my doctor ran a 24 hour urine test to check for creatine clearance in my urine.  I got the test results back last week.  It appears that the 25 years of taking Indomethacin has reduced my kidney function to 60 per cent.  I feel that is a fair trade off of being pain free most of the time.  My doctor wanted to do a trial of having me go off of Indomethacin to see how I would do without it.  He told me to stop taking it last Friday. Saturday I noticed stiffness and pain in my lower back my upper legs and my hips.  By Sunday I was in so much pain I was unable to walk.  When Monday morning came I phoned the doctor and went in to see him.  When he saw I was unable to walk he immediately put me back on Indomethacin.  I took one 75 mg capsule Monday night and started feeling better within 3 hours.  I awoke Tuesday morning with a bit of stiffness and pain and I took another 75 mg capsule. It is 3:35 PM and I have had no trouble walking and no pain and I just spent two hours on a riding lawn mower.  Without Indomethacin I would be in sad shape and could not do the daily functions of life without having great pain.

159, 3, Gout,The worst side effect that I have regularly been experiencing and wasn't sure that it was related until I saw all the other comments is panic attacks in the middle of the night - only when I take indomethacin close to bed time.  This is an awful side effect that seems to be getting progressively worse.  I have had really bad headaches_ intestinal pain_ diarrhea_ blood in the stool_ and dizziness/confusion.  But the panic attacks really suck and generally take hours to go away - there is no way to get back to sleep because of that and along with that the heart seems to be beating faster or fluttering - but that could be a reaction to the panic attack.,It really works great for controlling the inflamation caused by gout - but I would love to find another medication for when I have the flare ups.,M,44,3  years,11/28/2008Email,Indomethacin

I took a careful look at my diet and removed most of the problem foods. I watch my diet carefully but some foods still get thru to cause a reaction. One such food I removed was cake especially with sugary frostings. I have cut out most desserts and eat a more healthy diet. My first dosage of indo was 75mgs. This dosage was like a hot knife going thru butter. You could actually hear the crackling as the gout was breaking down. The warm feeling was such a relief.

On day six_ after the morning dose_ I decided to remove myself from the drug to use ibuprofen instead.  I think that in my case I should not have had this drug prescribed for me_ considering it's adverse potency.,TOUGH STUFF.  Handle with care...,M,54,5.5  days,6/21/2007,Indomethacin

I try to take nothing or tumeric_ which has similar but weaker analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties,F,55,3  years,6/2/2007,Indomethacin
217, 3, Gout,I have experience mild stomach ulceration and vomiting from prolonged used.,This drug was amazing at first but has become less and less effective over time.

218, 1, For Chronic back pain,I have had repeated bouts of severe edema and renal failure from it. My doctor did not see the warnings and gave me potassium sparing diuretics when I got edema from the Indomethacin_ and I nearly lost my kidneys several times. The last time I was on Lasix_ and of course_ because the edema was from the drug_ the Lasix did nothing adn my kidneys continued to fail.,I stopped taking the indo myself two days ago and I am aching all over and can hardly walk_ because my kidneys haven't kicked in yet.I am peeing like a racehorse though_ which is great_ and I am so much cleared in the head.

When first prescribed I was so thankful for the relief but I have been on my 5th straight week of taking the medication but the gout has spread from knees to wrists to elbows_ hands_ fingers and jaw. It hasn't settled at all this time and I am anxious as to why not. Need to get checked again. Is this the meds for me?,M,32,8  months,4/17/2007,Indomethacin
220, 1, ankylosing spondilitis,Dizziness_ confusion_ tiredness_ headaches_ light-headedness_ frightening dreams & nightmares,I took indomethacin for chronic hip pain_ for a period of about three months. During that time_ I was unable to perform to my normal standard at work_ due to the dizziness and confusion the drug caused. Indomethacin did stop my hip pain_ but I couldn't stand the side effects_ so I have since switched to Voltaren. This drug works just as well on the pain_ without the annoying mental effects.,F,29,3  months,3/2/2007,Indomethacin

222, 5, GOUT,No side affects that I'm aware of.,I was originally taking the drug for the very infrequent gout attacks that I had.  However_ as an additional benefit it greatly helped the chronic pain in my lower back.  I've been taking it as needed for back pain over the last few months.It's much_ much better than ibupropfen.,M,63,2  years,2/7/2007,Indomethacin

225, 5, Gout,Intestinal cramps_ softened stool_ frequent trips to the bathroom_ mild dehydration,Indomethicin dramatically reduces the gout pain in my foot after two or three 50 mg doses taken over a day or so. It is not a CURE for gout_ it just reduces the swelling (which is the source of most of the pain_ according to my doctor).

232, 5, Ankylosing Spondylitis,Tiredness and lethargy if taken in the morning.,Received diagnosis of AS after MRI and genetic blood testing. I also had a CAT scan that showed internal inflammation in right side. Extreme pain mostly in my back (all up and down my spine)and on my side. I was prescribed 75 mg. 2x daily but I am pain free with one pill at bedtime. This drug has been a miracle for me as I have experienced pain from age 23 until now. Prior to taking this drug I hadn't slept through the night in at least three years do to agonizing pain. I now sleep like a baby_ totally pain free_ and I can now work and exercise all I want during the day with no pain.,F,38,8  months,5/26/2006,Indomethacin
233, 3, Prescribed for Gout,Take too much and stomach problems.,Formerly on Colchicine_ went to a new doc and he prescribed PREDNISONE_ a cortiosteroid_ and Indomethacin. Both of these have the same result - they reduce the inflamation and pain - but do NOTHING to stop the attack. I have had attacks last up to a month now on this new doc's ideas (makes me wonder if he just wants to keep me coming back?$$$). Took one_ my last one_ Colchicine last week and the next day the gout was 1/2 as bad (with no Indo or steroids). Am seriously going to get a 2nd opinion tomorrow. Do the research - Indomethacin does not cure Gout - it is a NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammitory drug) designed to reduce inflammation and pain - that's it. You must take something designed to fight gout to stop an attack unless you are just lucky and your body gets around to reducing uric acid levels and crystals itself (never happened for me)...,M,46,1.6  years,5/15/2006,Indomethacin
234, 1, inflamation from injured hamstring,Headaches and sensativity to sunlight_ dizziness_ loss of appitite_ stomache ache_ mood swings and canker sores.,I would definently suggest a natural remedy verses indomethacin. I took the medication for one week at 50mg once a day and it's been two days since I stopped the medication and I am still having headaches and sensitivity to food. I'm focused on trying to feel better from the medication instead of healing my hamstring muscle.  Kind of defeats the original purpose.,F,51,7  days,3/21/2006,Indomethacin

237, 5, Reactive arthritis,None,I have a swollen knee_ elbow and inflamed back and neck_ with major stiffness and pain. Taking a high dose of Brufen Retard (800mg twice daily) for months_ did absolutely nothing. Immediately noticed an improvement on Indomethacin (75mg SR_ twice daily)_ and have continued to improve a little more each day. Pain is mostly gone and stiffness and swelling reduced. Wish I'd been prescribed it months ago!,F,40,8  days,2/1/2006,Indomethacin
238, 4, Gout,I take mine rectally.  I become a little dizzy_ and (sometimes) have to rush to the toilet twenty minutes after taking one.,One time I took two aspirin for a headache_ and later took one indomehacin.  I began feeling as though I was going to die.  I could feel my heart beating_ and felt weak_ and had to sit down and stay very still.  I'm as strong as an ox_ and have never felt like I was going to die before.  Then I look up this drug and side effects_ and 'aspirin' on google_ and found out that combining these can be lethal!  Would have been nice if it was written on the *#&%$@ packet. So I guess my advice is; use the drug but only when you have to_ and whatever you do_ don't have aspirin the same day.,M,48,30  days,1/30/2006,Indomethacin

I have since been taking Indomethacin ER 75 mg capsules (twice daily) for over 12 years and with no problems or side effects.    Indomethacin does work well for me but works much better if I supplement it with 2 Darvocet's per day.  I was told by my Rheumatologist that Idomethacin is now the drug of choice for Ankylosing Spondylitis since the previous drug of choic_ Butazolidin was taken off the market.,M,56,12  years,1/27/2006Email,Indomethacin
