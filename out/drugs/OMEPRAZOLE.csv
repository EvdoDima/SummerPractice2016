0, 1, Indigestion_belching,POISON TO MY SYSTEM--WISH I HAD READ THESE POSTS FIRST< NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE ON IT!!! I first want to say that I am a normally healthy individual who does not like to see a doctor unless I really have to (although I do have yearly well-visits). Saw my dr. with complaint of indigestion/feeling of fullness in stomach/belching that was not relieved by Tums or baking soda and was put on Omeprazole DR 40 mg 1x a day in am...I really thought that this drug was like a prescription Tums (NOT!)_ but only because I had not done any research on it and was simply going by my assumption. Symptoms got worse and included chest tightness_ stabbing chest pain near heart and radiating to underarms and up the side of neck on left side_ heart palpitations_ tingling in fingers_ brain fog all day_ worsening constriction in throat that made swallowing difficult_ sweaty palms and sole of feet_ no sleep due to increasing symptoms. Dr. then added Pepcid AC at bedtime (!). Symptoms continued with brief hours,"PLEASE PLEASE read personal reviews of any drugs (prescription or over-the-counter) before taking. I wish I had_ because I am 2 days clean now and have subsiding symptoms_ with flare-ups throughout the day (last 2 nights were restful_ though). Wish there was a way to rid this of my body quicker! I was only on it for 11 days_ but I feel that it is going to take some time for my body to completely detox. My brain fog comes and goes_ as does the discomfort on the left side of my neck/jaw and chest tightness/stabbing pain. I do not like to take any medications_ and previously was only on a baby aspirin for heart and a multivitamin. Otherwise completely healthy with annual checkups and great reports_ now I feel that my life has been turned upside down. All started when I began the Omeprazole and Pepcid AC. I am aware that we have to be cautious when using the internet_ but when a vast majority of people are reporting horrendous symptoms such as the ones found here_ you must admit that there is some validity to it. Doctors will disagree_ but you need to BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE!! I am staying hopefully optimistic that my symptoms will continue to subside--at least I know what to expect when one of the panic attacks creeps up on me (although it is hard to rationalize this when you are having one_ things escalate so rapidly and there is an awful feeling of ""this is what the end looks like"" ). If you are reading this because you have these symptoms_ please know that you are not",F,52,11  days40 mg 1X D,8/10/2016Email,Omeprazole
1, 1, Hiatal Hernia,I am not sure about the side effects is from this _ but reading about this I think it might be.  All from Dizziness_ Drinking an absurd amount of water_ depressed_ sleepy_ insomnia_ animia ( required bloodtransfusion) and lots more _ maybe more allergic ( got 2 anaphylactic shocks within a month),2 months ago I got really bad breathing trouble _ it is like I can not get the air all the way down to my lungs. My lungs and heart got checked but there was nothing wrong_ other than I suffer from a low puls from time to time. The doctors then made the conclusion that it is because of my back_ The doctor gave me Tramadol for my back pain and then it got really scary after 3 pills (not at once) I got an anaphylactic shock and was taken to the hospital. A month after this I took some bricanyl inhaler because I was so frustrated with my trouble of breathing properly. I have taken this medicine before and I did not have any problem with this medicine. This time I got my second anaphylactic shock.After 2 anaphylactic shock I was so scared to take my medicine_ so 7 days ago I stopped taken my Omeprazole.First thing I noticed I now drink water like a normal person. But I am so dizzy that I am afraid to pass out. I have lots of panic attacks and overall feel like my muscles does not work properly and I have been sweating/cold sweating like crazy. But on the positive side my breathing is almost back to normal. Can any of you tell me how long I will feel like crap_ with dizziness and panic attack and sweating and breathing trouble ?Can someone please me help _ I have not taken them for 7 days now _ but today my breathing is not good again. Can someone reassure ? Plz mail me.,F,41,19  years20 MG 2X D,3/29/2016Email,Omeprazole

I had to take Omeprazole along with Pylera to treat h. pylori.  Both medications made me very ill to where I am unable to work during the treatment period. Initially thought all of the symptoms were related to the Pylera_ but after completing the Pylera and only taking Omeprazole I know for sure that these side effects are from this medication.  I also researched the side effects on the manufacturers website.  Advocate for yourself_ be knowledgeable of the research results of this medication and speak honestly with your physician.   Prior to taking Pylera and Omeprazole I was a fairly healthy person_ exercised consistently_ calm_ not prone to anxiety attacks and I look forward to those days again once this medication leaves my system.  I'm happy for those who reap the benefits of this medication without the side effects and pray for those who are going through what I've experienced.",F,54,14  days1 2X D,5/28/2015,Omeprazole
9, 1, Acid Reflux,None unless I missed a dose.,I was told to quit taking this as my magnesium levels had plummeted and I was experiencing chronic pins and needles and muscle cramps. My doctor recommended I stopped taking it straight away and gave me Zantac instead. I am over a month in now and I have to be ridiculously careful about what I eat_ even fresh air gives me acid reflux. The only good night's sleep I get is if I throw up before dozing off and I've lost a tonne of weight. Also_ haven't had a solid stool in about as long as i was taking the omeprazole.,F,42,6  years60mg 1X D,5/14/2015Email,Omeprazole

I thought stress was causing it. Then_ I had chest pains and skipped heart beats a few days ago. I googled ""Prilosec and chest pain""_ and read many posts from people complaining of anxiety while taking it. Wow. It all makes sense now! I'm going to discuss alternative treatments with my doctor.

11, 1, Heartburn,I have been taking Omeprazole 20mg once per day for about 5 months. This past Friday night about an hour after a normal dinner_ I started shivering and felt terrible. My palms started sweating and I had to immediately throw up. I do not suffer from panic attacks_ I am a very laid back and mellow person_ but this sure felt like one. I was naseous_ I couldn't hold any food down_ and I became a weeping mess (I was sad_ confused_ and thought my whole world was going to end). Once it finally subsided after an hour or so_ I felt tired and sluggish and immediately went to bed. The next morning I had no appetite and didn't feel at all like myself. I managed to shower and felt a bit better_ but I decided to visit the doctor_ who said I probably had an autonomic nerve problem(?). I told him I took Omeprazole_ but he said it was perfectly safe and not to worry. He prescribed an anit-nausea medicine and said to not eat big meals for a while (which I hadn't done anyway). I went home_ had a small lu,,M,42,5  months20mg 1X D,4/27/2015Email,Omeprazole
12, 1, hiatal hernia,,I called my doctor and although she doesn't agree with my supposition about the omeprazole side effects_ she okayed me going off of it.  It is now 48 hours since I last took one_ and so far the headaches are gone_ and a good part of the pain in my back and right buttock.  The rash still itches but not as it's a little better.  It may take weeks or months for all of the toxicity to leave my system so I'm not expecting the rash to disappear over night.  I feel slightly less bloated and again from what I have read of other peoples reports_ that may take a while to abate as well.  I will continue to report back here with each new development because one of the things I wanted to know_ was how long to expect the side effects to continue once I stopped taking the omeprazole. I realize it's going to be different for everyone because it's affected by dosage_ length of use_ body size_ and age.,M,66, 20 mg 1X D,7/19/2014EmailHistory,Omeprazole

15, 4, Acid reflux,Severe anxiety after about 60 days_ depression,Worked very well for acid reflux_ I was in bad shape so I had to take it every day for 3 months. The incessant coughing stopped_ and the chest pains went away completely within days. I didn't notice the anxiety at first_ but as it got worse_ I got the point where I had a near breakdown and became non-functional for a week. I became severely depressed as well. I began to suspect the omeprazole_ as I do not ever normally experience that level of anxiety_ and my suspicions were confirmed when I stopped taking the drug. Within 3 days_ my anxiety level was back to normal_ and after a week_ the depression lifted. I would not recommend taking this drug for more than a month before taking a break from it.,F,43,90  days20mg 1X D,3/8/2014,Omeprazole
