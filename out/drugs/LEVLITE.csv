Used to last 3 days_ now about 7.,I have never been the person to get break outs_ even in high school_ but ever since I have been on this BC I have had the WORST acne I've ever had! I snap at my husband on a daily basis & I get emotional & tear up/cry over little things. I NEVER used to be a cryer. I like the bigger boobs_ but not the pain.

1, 3, To regulate my period/,I just ended my period and it was the worst 7 days of my life. I layed on the couch in the worst pain i've ever been in in my entire life. The cramps were unbearable_ huge blood clots_ going through at least 15 tampons a day. Craziness. My breasts are so sore_ I get very irritated easily_ freaking out on my boyfriend for no reason...getting upset when he would touch me...let alone try and have sex.,,F,20,1  months1-2g 1X D,1/14/2011Email,Levlite
2, 3, birth control,I've gained 10lbs_ periods supposed to be lighter_ are heavier than my normal ones_ and last longer. About 7 days now_ compared to before my norm was 3 days. Breasts enlarged_ the only side effect I like. Mood swings seem worse now too.,,F,20,4  months 1X D,9/14/2010,Levlite
3, 4, Regulate cycle,Heavy cycles but regulated cycles. Mood balanced_ mellow and calm attitude_ less irritated more emotional.,So far so good for me. Before taking Levlite_ I had horrible mood swings. I would wake up angry and typically anything would make me angry. I started taking Levlite after talking to my doctor about my ridiculously irregular cycle (1 cycle every 5-6 months). The only things I am concerned about are my extremely heavy cycles_ they last for nearly two weeks_ so it seems like the are frequent. During the cycles I feel extreme fatigue. But I would recommend this to anyone that has mood swings_ irregular cycles...,F,26,4  months0.02 1X D,6/6/2010Email,Levlite
4, 2, BC/Regulate Cycle,Extreme psychotic depression and some initial spotting,I'm so glad I found this page of reviews. For the past week I have been extremely depressed & psychotic: ie_ freaking out over NOTHING and recognizing that fact but NOT being able to control the rage I felt b/c of it...on top of crying every single day-a lot. I've NEVER been this way_ so I figured it was a combo of quitting smoking and pms_ b/c normally I'm not THIS bad; However after reading others' comments_ I believe it could be due to this new pill and I'm going to ask my dr to change.,F,24,16  days0.1mg/0.02 1X D,2/25/2010Email,Levlite

7, 1, Too control heavy bleeding,Heart attack_ blood clots in legs and lungs_ hospitalized twice.Must use blood thinners permanently. Doctor was careless and issued my wife 30 day samples without regarding her age and medical history. This product left permanent damage after 3 wks use.,After exhaustive research of this product and birth control in general. I want everyone to imagine being slowly poisoned over years. I hear women claim that they receive excellent benefits from birth control with no side effects except when they are diagnosed with ovarian cancers_ breast problems_ pelvic disorder's_ etc. their doctors will cover all the possible scenarios that contributed to the problems_ but are silent about may have been the culprit for the deaths of so many women: Birth Control pills.  Some doctors and medical scientist are stepping up to the plate now and sounding the alarm. But others in the medical_ pharmaceutical and legal professions will only look out for one factor: The Mighty Dollar.  Fact: Any food or drug that alters the natural function of the human body or counters from what it was designed to do_ will cause adverse effects. That is what Birth Control does.  You can trust the hype and play games with your health. Or get serious and educate yourselves. Th,F,53,3  weeks,4/19/2008Email,Levlite
8, 5, all other BC's made me SICK!!,With the NAME brand Levlite I have experienced no side effects. With the GENERIC form I became psychotic_ emotional_ and extremely moody.,I would suggest anyone that uses the GENERIC form and has had bad side effects try the NAME brand. The name brand makes my periods light_ last maybe a day or two_ no emotionally mood swings or PMS or cramps AT ALL. However_ the GENERIC was horribly awful. Wish my insurance covered the name brand because it is expensive but worth it in many ways.,F,27,6  years,4/1/2008Email,Levlite
9, 2, ,First month I bled for 2 weeks_ second month I had the most awful cramps I've ever had_ third month I still had awful cramps_ to the point of almost fainting_ and some breakthrough bleeding.  Also_ my stomach is always bothering me_ I don't have a day without nausea.  Additionally_ I have lost weight but so much so that I don't have hips or breasts too much anymore and my skin has an acne problem I haven't had since I was a teenager.,I don't recommend this one - I was on Lo-Ovral 28 some years ago and had few if any of these problems,F,28,3  months,4/1/2008,Levlite

I also get flu-like nausea during the second week of pills.  Called Dr. to switch.,F,37,4  months,3/13/2008,Levlite
11, 1, contraceptive,Weight gain_ mood swings_ and it didn't work,I had switched from Yasmin because it made me absolutely numb... emotionally_ sexually_ etc.  I switched to levelite (generic lessina) and it seemed a little wierd at first.  My first cycle after the first month took DAYS to show up.  After month number 2... got pregnant while on it.  I'm on no medications_ and completely healthy_ and also took them like clockwork everyday.  So I assume it just wasn't strong enough.  I never had a problem with Alesse but they stopped making it due to a packaging problem and I never found it again.  They're supposed to be the same... apparently NOT!,F,31,2  months,2/8/2008,Levlite

13, 1, prevent pregnancy,I was on Levlite almost 10 years ago.  I developed an anxiety disorder and had panic attacks.  Both of which completely disappeared when a new gyno recommened I stop taking Levlite.  She had seen that happen before with some pills.  Also_ I lost my sex drive. I didn't even want to be touched_ let alone have sex.  Again_ when I stopped taking it_ things got better and the sex drive came back very quickly.,I was taking Levlite because I was a smoker at the time.  The low estrogen was great for me in that regard_ but this particular pill didn't work for me.,F,32,2  years,9/25/2007,Levlite
14, 4, severe cramping,I have experienced quite a lot of headaches in the last 4 years I have been taking Levlite.  4 years ago I was hospitalized for a subdurral bleed in my brain_ Dr.'s were puzzled as to why this happened_ but a later test showed it was gone.  3 weeks ago I was hospitalized with a 6 inch blood clot in my brain_ again Dr.'s are puzzled.  They said this probably happened because of the use  of oral contraceptives.   God has been watching over me_ because death could have been the result.  Please use oral contrceptives with caution and if something doesn't feel right_ it probably isn't.  Call your Dr.,levlite did help with my severe cramping and my story is rare_ this is not going to happen to everyone.,F,33,10  years,7/7/2007,Levlite

23, 3, Birth Control,Breakthrough bleeding,My doctor prescribed this to me because of the low dosage_ but I think I'm going to have to switch to something higher. I have experienced a lot of breakthrough bleeding in the past two months (I have been taking Levlite for 6 months now)_ to the point where I am bleeding 2 out of the four weeks each month. I like the fact that there are basically no other side effects that I've experienced_ but I can't deal with the seemingly constant bleeding.,F,25,6  months,4/6/2007,Levlite

Went to the doctor to regulate cycles and told her I wanted to take Alesse again.  Pharmasists handed me Levlite and told me it was the same kind.

I originally switched from Ortho Low to Levlite because of weight gain issues.

37, 5, mood control,Levlite has been great. No bad side effects at all. It feels like I am not taking a bc pill. If anything I feel my mood is a lot better! I am bipolar so that is why I turned to bc pills for some help with mood swings. so far so good;),I have only been on levlite 2 weeks so I'll update you all.GREAT FOR BIPOLAR WOMEN SO FAR. I heard it was good for bipolar women to start on a low dose pill. But if you are bipolar please stay away from Yasmin with drsp and any of the tri-cyclics-trust me!! I was a weeping fool on Yasmin and my hair started falling out and then I couldn't sleep when I went off of it so that was back in February. I haven't been on another pill since until now. and I was on a tri-cyclic in 2001 and just remember the varying levels of estrogen playing havoc with my mood...yuck.. Good luck.

41, 3, birth control,Two periods a month_ or periods lasting 2 weeks.,After 2.5 or 3 years of taking Levlite (and_ occasionally_ the generic version_ Lessina)I started to have weird_ sometimes heavy bleeding between periods_ or a period lasting 2 weeks. Some months I would just have a regular period_ and I would think things had returned to normal_ but then the next month my cycle would be weird again. This has been going on for over a year. I didn't have any other side effects_ so my doctor told me I should stay on Levlite if the bleeding wasn't bothering me. Because Levlite is such a light dose_ it may not be strong enough to regulate my period_ but_ in general_ she said it's better to stay on the lightest pill possible. However_ the whole point of being on the pill was to have sex without getting pregnant and with the bleeding all the time_ I was having way too little sex. The doctor gave me an rx for ovcom 35 and I will try that for a few months to see what happens.,F,23,4  years,4/6/2006,Levlite

If I'm going to be angry (sometimes violent) and depressed all the time_ then I really need to switch.  Before taking this pill (and another one that i tried)_ I was happy and never sad or angry and I was never really self-conscious about my body.
