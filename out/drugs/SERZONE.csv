0, 5, depression,"Difficulty falling asleep if taken at night.  Tired first few weeks.  Nausea and decreased appetite if taken on an empty stomach.  When it ""kicks in"" a couple of hours after I take it_ it feels like I have Icy Hot on my arms and legs.","Side effects are nothing compared to the horrible feeling of major depression.  I didn't think it was working but after 4 weeks_ I felt better than I had in years.  I'm happy_ energetic_ motivated_ positive_ mellow_ and glad to be alive.  Tried Lexapro and Wellbutrin in the past and neither came close to making me feel so ""normal"".  The only other thing that has been comparable is Vyvanse which was prescribed for ADD and not depression.  Before I took nefazodone_ I was just waiting to die.  Now I want to live life to the fullest.  I wish I had tried it earlier.  It has saved me.",F,42,1  months150,1/22/2016Email,Serzone
1, 4, Major Depression and Anxiety,This drug is helping me so much! I no longer pick fights with my boyfriend or get mad over stupid things. All of the SSRI drugs helped a little but I was tired all the time and would sleep 12 hours with no relief. I then went to Cymbalta which was not for me! It's didn't help my insomnia from my anxiety at all and made it worse!! So_ now I'm taking Nefodozone and I'm seeing a huge difference. I sleep better and wake up feeling rested!! I'm just worried because all of this stuff online talking about liver damage and death! Can anyone give me advice? Are you worried about this?,,F,32,10  days200,1/5/2016Email,Serzone
2, 5, major depression_  anxiety,Absolutely none,I am taking the generic_ nefazadone. I suffered from severe major depression ever since I was a child. I've been on every medicine I can think of_ but with side effects that I didn't want to deal with. I would spend hours and hours on the Internet researching meds and I stumbled upon nefazadone.I asked my psy if she would let me try it_ and she did.I paired it with my 450 mg of wellbutrin that wasn't working as well as it used to. Nefazadone has been the answer to my prayers. It had controlled my depression_  my anxiety and even my social anxiety. I am 100% better than Ive ever been my entire life. We just upped it to 300 mg because I started experiencing tiredness and lack of energy throughout the day.this medicine has saved my life_  my relationship with the love of my life and the relationship with my children.  I am so much happier_ much more at piece with myself and much more sociable than I've ever been in my life. Plus_  I have no side effects whatsoever_ especially weight gain.  I gained 15 lbs while experimenting with other meds and lost all of it after being put on nefazadone_  all without dieting or exercising.,F,49,7  months200 mg,12/19/2015Email,Serzone

Unfortunately it stopped working as well and now only on 200mg. All SSRI_ SNRI_ TCA and others stopped working. ECT_ rTMS_ Ketamine_ Neurofeedback and hospital admissions have not relieved my ""Terminal"" depression.

There is huge interest in this drug in these countries_ I am personally of Bulgaria and my doctor advised me to seek nefazodone because previous drug that takes Remeron although very good_ stopped working after four years.

My family noticed an improvement in my reliability and some memory.  Short- term memory is still quite weak.Within one year of starting Nefazodone felt OK_ centered.

But my mind was so fuzzy on this drug that_ when playing Scrabble with friends_ I literally had to use a calculator when I was the scorekeeper! (Before this_ I could literally multiply three 5-digit numbers in my head with ease.) I lost memory function on this med_ and also lost actual memories. I've still never recovered_ and find everything so much more difficult than it used to be.

21, 5, Had been on ALL anti-depressants,I  took every morning. Serzone was the MIRACLE medication for me. It was black boxed and was put on Lexapro and gained40 lbs.  in  two weeks. Finally found that Nefazodone was generic form of Serzone and have been taking since 2006. The problem now is there seems to be a shortage of Nefazodone. I can't seem to get  the same answer from any pharmacies!! Have enough to last through Aug. by dividing higher dose to amt. I'm supposed to take. Knowing this med. is a class unlike the SSR. I'm afraid because tried going off  with SSR's and totally messed me up.  IMO_ I will have to gradually taper IF the manufactor TEVA doesn't  continue as they are the best imo.,"Started Serzone Brand in 1999 and was like a new life had been granted to me. It surpassed ALL past anti-depressants and actually felt as close to being ""normal' and not in a ""high""or buzzed way.

I am frightened. One dose missed and I am back to where I was when I was first diagnosed. I have tried other drugs. I have tried to get off of this medication. It makes me functional. It provides me with quality of life. I don't know what I will do if I do not have access to this medicine. The thought of going back to what I was before I started to take it frightens me more than the possible risk of liver damage. That can be monitored. I took 300 mg for many years.

After that_ there were ABSOLUTELY NO SIDE EFFECTS for me.,Serzone has been unavailable in Canada now for a number of years. I have not been able to find a drug that even comes close the effectiveness of Serzone. I am very mad that they took it off the market because 0.0006% (4 out of 650_000) of the people experienced liver damage_ that's not even close to a scientifically statistically significant amount. From what I've read the people who did experience liver damage were being prescribed double the recommended daily maximum.

Significant withdrawl effects if I missed a couple of doses (weird hot flashes_ night sweats and insomnia),I was in complete remission on Serzone for several years and I for one would take it again in a heartbeat if it were still available in Canada (I have not ruled out getting the generic from the US).  It's biggest benefits over other antidepressants are the fact that it has Zero negative effects on sex drive and sexual functioning AND it's weight neutral.  Also I drank like a fish on it so if anyone_ I should have had liver problems with it and never did.  I wonder if there's more to the picture than meets the eye regarding the real reason (besides a few liver problems) it was pulled from the market.

34, 5, Depression,This will sound terrible_ but compared to the effects I was having on SSRIs which had NO effect on my depression_ this was nothing:Dry mouth_ irritable bowel syndrome_ blurred vision/visual trails_ muscle weakness and coordination problems_ extreme sleepiness 30-90 min after taking a dose (passed after about 90 min)_ feelings of intoxication_ dilated pupils_ slurred speech (v similar to being drunk - again this dissipated approx 90 min after the dose)_ ongoing memory and vision problems (6 years after stopping).,I loved Serzone.  It was the only medication which had ANY effect on my depression.  On other medication (Celexa_ Zoloft_ Aurorix) I had horrendous shakes and nightmares and no perceptible improvement in my depression.  I wish it was still available to me.I was on 600mg/day (max dose).  I went to 750mg/day when I had a bad period.I took 4 doses per day - 150mg per dose - the intoxicating effects were too severe if I took 300mg at once.  I'd fall asleep at my desk and be unable to speak clearly.  I took my last dose a few hours before I went to bed otherwise I'd wake up with a hangover.The coordination/muscle weakness was difficult and I put on a lot of weight.  If I tried to stay out late the visual disturbances would be severe and my pupils would dilate so much that any light would be painful.I've been off it 6 years now but I think I've got lasting side effects.  I have dilated pupils most of the time (although this could be due to the length of time I took antidepressants in general_ not just Serzone_ or the fact that I had an alcohol/marijuana abuse problem)_ my memory is terrible_ my eyesight seems to be deteriorating more rapidly than seems normal_ and occasionally I get what feel like Serzone flashbacks - I get the intoxicated feeling_ the muscle weakness and the visual trails every now and then.Note that I am very sensitive to all medications so my side effects are on the severe end of the scale.

A beatiful little girl.  I had always been raised to accept what God gives you and go on.  Well that does not work.  I COULD NOT get out of bed.  I knew I had a problem when one day I over heard my oldest child_ Jason ask his daddy_ when he came home from work_ one evening if he could stay home.  He told his father that Momma never gets out of bed.  I knew then I had to see a doctor.  The doctor at that time gave me Prozac.  So when I went prior to my father's death I asked for the same thimg.  I was told by my wonderful doctor that Prozac is used when a person is really down to ""bring them up"" and serzone helps to keep you even and calm.  He was right.  After 8 years on it I decided on my own I was cured and tapered myself off of it.  (Big mis",I never had any problems_ but I did go on a regular basis for my liver function tests.

About 6 months later  the company I am working with sent me  out of town.  I went to see a couple of doctors there (this was about the time they were deciding to take it off the market). Long story short no one would prescribe it for me. I am back home and have just begun to get off of Effexor_ which for me_ has not been working.I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  My doctor gave in after seeing that nothing else was working for me.  I will never get off this miracle drug again.  No more stress_ no more neck pain_ no more headaches.

I went up to 45mg very quickly and it helped a bit but I wanted to eat everything in sight so he switched me to serzone - started at 200mg and went up to 300mg which is where I remain.  I still have mild anxiety but it's very manageable.  My mom has been on this drug for 10+ years with no side effects.  I did have my liver checked when I first started taking it and will continue to have it checked every 6 months.

Doctor said body can get good at processing it and make it less effective. I tried to change over when I heard it was going out of production_ but had a horrible experience with the other drug.  I am interested in hearing from other long time users. I am more forgetful_ but I am also older_ and have survived some truly horrible times. Stress takes its toll on memory. My eyesight is getting worse_ but it often does when one ages.  Meanwhile_ it feels good to be myself_ able to handle the incredible things that life throws at me without a breakdown.

43, 5, Panic/anxiety; Mod. Depression,"At higher doses visual ""trails"" especially when getting up an night to urinate_ but they are sort of neat actually.  Mild anorgasmia (inability to orgasm)and mild emotional ""deadening.""","About the liver problem: Estimates indicate about 1 in 250_000 patient years will develop liver problems.  If your urine turns brown_ your stool (poop) starts to turn white or the whites of your eyes start to turn yellow_ seek medical help. Get liver profile before and while taking especially in the beginning.  It appears that the people that died may have had liver issues even before the Serzone made it worse.  I cannot take SSRI's because my Cytochrome liver enzyme systems do not clear them causing a rapid toxic level.  Serzone uses a different Cytochrome system which seems intact for me so it works well.  Its effects are a bit subtle_ but I get a good balance of relief and I find that I can drop to 200mg/day when my life has little stress_ and increase to 600mg/day at high stress times like December with Christmas and reduced daylight.  Unlike other meds one can drop dosage or increase dosage quite rapidly.  I find that I can take a ""drug holiday"" and go for several days on half the dose_ and then resume. This mediates any anorgasmia. I also like Nefazodone because it is a sleep moderator and I sleep better with it.  When I take 300mg/day I take 200 before bedtime and 100 in the morning.  If I need to take 400 I'll do 200 at night_ 100 in the morning and 100 at lunch_ otherwise I'll get mild lightheartedness.

The Wellbutrin was not helping for my panic disorder so my Phychiatrist suggested adding Serzone.  I took 50 mg before bed around 9:00 pm.  Around 11:00 pm I started feeling unusually panicky.  Shortly after the rest of the horrible side effects began.  I have become very good at diffusing panic attacks when they occur_ but this one was so severe I was not able to diffuse it at all.  I read on the internet that the stuff takes between 11-24 hours to clear out of your system.  I did not feel normal again until 5 pm the following day.

Psychiatrist is sending me to a neurologist to confirm.,"Been on the medication for 6-7 years now after living a debilitated life of constant anxiety_ stiff neck_ headaches_ chronic physical/ verbal and emotional anger _ acute OCD_ and some paranoia. Finally allowed myself to take medication but refused to go on SSRIs as I did not want weight gain and/or sexual dysfunction. Nefazadone (the generic) after a month was the first time in my life that I could take a deep breath_ literally. Small things did not send my mind spinning and I was finally calm enough to be silly and fun. People did not know who I was and I started to get invited to social events again. Wanted however to see if my problems with memory recall and trying to get things off ""the tip of my tongue"" were starting to result from the many years of use. Addtionally_ wanted to see if the weight gain was due in part to the medication as well.

My Serzone dosage is 100 mg_ twice daily. I can say that the Nefazodone has helped a lot. I'm much less anxious than I was before. Now I sleep much better_ too. Libido has improved quite a bit (my wife would agree with that statement). The downside is that getting up in the morning can be difficult. I'll often feel a bit sleepy and unmotivated.

I took this with two other medications to treat depression and anxiety_ and when I stopped taking this one_ I did not notice a significant change in mood or behavior.  I think this is a good alternative for people who do not respond to SSRIs.  However!  GET YOUR LIVER FUNCTIONS TESTED OFTEN.  My doctor did this thank GOD_ because this drug has been connected to serious liver problems.,Because of the potential liver problems_ I decided to stop taking this medication.  I was taking 400 mg_ with 450mg of Wellbutrin and 2.5 mg of Zyprexa.  I did not notice a change in mood when I stopped taking Serzone.  The risk of liver damage was too scary for me when I wasn't 100% sure it was helping me.  The tests they do for liver enzyme functions do seem to be very accurate and would surely indicate oddities before any very serious liver problem developed.  Lots of lawsuits about this med_ though_ and I think it is not prescribed in most countries other than the U.S.,F,29,2  years,8/25/2006,Serzone
93, 1, depression,I took at bedtime because I was told it would make me drowsy.  About 45 minutes after falling asleep_ I woke up with hot flashes_ chills_ dizzynes_ vomiting and a severe panic attack.  I had to call the pharmacy to ask if I could take phenergan because I kept vomitting bile and at one point became hysterical.  I was laughing and crying at the same time.,Never been so terrified by reaction to a drug in my life.  I've been on Wellbutrin for years and my doctor added this to help with mood swings.  I will never take this drug again_ ever!,F,46,1  days,7/20/2006,Serzone

Thirst and headache first few days.Mid night wakening_ vivid dreams.Nausea first week of therapy. I use a sleeping pill to deal with sleep disturbances.,This drug has proved to be excellent at abating my depressive feelings and though it takes some forbearance adjusting to side effects at first_ it is worth the improved mood_ lack of anxiety and lack of sexual side effects.Have also been on celexa_ wellbutrin_ effexor and felt best wtih serzone.,F,50,4  years,10/8/2005,Serzone

106, 3, depression,visual trails_ memory loss_ confusion_ speech issues_ minor motor skills issues.,I like it. Was on 300 mg per day_ now up to 400_ but all of a sudden the memory loss is very pronounced. It has evened out my moods_ for better and for worse (not depressed but never really happy either). I feel the mental side effects (memory loss_ confusion_ lack of motivation are really affecting my life -- personally and professionally -- so I am thinking about quitting. On a positive side: no effect on sex drive (never had one_ still don't)_ no effect on weight_ and good at filling in the deepest pits of depression.,F,35,1.5  years,7/15/2004,Serzone
107, 4, Depression,Early side effects -trippy vision trails. Fall asleep in five minutes. Weird dreams. Over time I noticed an extreme lack of motivation.

It saps your creative drive.,F,31,2  years,6/17/2004,Serzone
108, 5, depression/anxiety/panic attacks,Weird visual effects (trails and a trippy feeling) at first when taken during the day. I switched to taking one dosage per day at bedtime (300 mg) and now have almost no side effects. Sex drive is fine_ no weight gain or loss_ sleep is good. Nausea for a few minutes if I'm still awake when it kicks in_ a little dizzyness sometimes if I get up in the middle of the night. If I miss more than one dose_ I'll sometimes have a night of broken sleep and alternate feeling hot and then cold all night (covers on_ covers off_ repeat). I'll be back to normal the next day_ though. Alcohol (more than 3 drinks or so) seems to cancel the drug out for that day but doesn't cause any bad reactions for me. The only slightly bad thing I can say (now that I've tried Wellbutrin) is that Serzone might cause me to be a bit unmotivated and slightly lethargic. Then again_ that might just be me_ with or without Serzone.,Serzone's been a godsend to me for over 9 years in keeping my depression and anxiety in check. Not that I never get in a bad mood or feel down or irritable_ but now it lasts for a day or two instead of a month or two. Overall_ I feel normal and pretty balanced when I'm on it. I used to have a problem with panic attacks but haven't had a single one since I've been on this drug. Occasional situational anxiety or sleeplessness can be completely cured with one .25 mg Xanax. I recently switched to Wellbutrin XL (about 2 weeks ago) because of the discontinuation of Serzone and the liver disease problems_ but I think I'm going to go back to the Serzone (generic is still available and hopefully will be for a long time to come). Wellbutrin made me feel energetic and unusually motivated for the first few days_ which I loved (Serzone doesn't do this_ unfortunately)_ but I'm bothered by other side effects like instant weight gain_ restless sleep_ an increasingly tense and slightly anxious feeling_ and the fear of new panic attacks or even seizures (I was twitching the other day after having had a few drinks the night before and it really scared me because I've read that alcohol can lower the threshold for seizures and twitching can be a sign of an impending seizure.) I'm really not sure what to do at this point but I'll figure it out in the next few days.,F,42,9  years,6/9/2004,Serzone
109, 4, depression_ insomnia_ and anxiety,I get irritable mood about every other day but this appears to be due to me have early morning awakening in which I wake up one hour before I want to and can't fall asleep. I feel worn out and fatigued on these days. Lots of my symptoms are from environmental factors_ so that when there's stress factors (eg. moving_ looking for work)_ I get depressed.  I am dysthymic_ having some chronic depression. My brochure from a few years ago says serzone should help with edgy_ irritable mood. I actually like the medicine.  I have been on 400 mg but was reduced to 350 mg.  I take most of dose before bed with a benzodiazepam and get right to sleep.  I like serzone because I am not getting up at 1 am like I used to with Buspar.,I am taking serzone about 5 years now.  I saw brochures in the mental health clinic and asked if could try it out.  I really liked the brochure information. When the drug label warning came out_ my psychiatrist informed me and recommended another medicine but I didn't want to switch.  About 1 year ago when I got another doctor_ I was told again about the warnings.  At first_ my new doctor wanted me off it_ but then agreed to do blood work to monitor my liver enzymes.  I have normal blood work and feel O.K. with taking it.  I heard about the FDA recall in June_ 2004 but I want to stay with serzone.,F,44,5  years,5/25/2004,Serzone

I'm feeling great_ liver function is normal. I'm quite surprised to read the comments of the other folks but take solace in the very small and possibly biased sample.,M,63,3  years,4/22/2004,Serzone
113, 1, Depression,Serzone worked fine in the beginning_ but after a few month I started to feel very sick for several hours after taking it.   We tried adjusting the dosage and time of day that I took it but nothing helped.  This went on for over a year.  After about another year the effectiveness started to decrease so I tried to switch to a different drug.  Trying to get off of Serzone was a nightmare_ literally.  I had nightmares_ night sweats and terrible anger for almost 2 months after tapering and stopping Serzone.,I would never tell anyone to take this drug.  It's bee banned in almost every country except the US and I think it is dangerous!,M,34,2  years,4/16/2004,Serzone
114, 1, depression,groggy_ woozy - couldn't wake up_ unsteady on my feet_ dry mouth_ nausea,My doctor wanted to supplement the Wellbutrin I was already taking_ and gave me a sample packet of Serzone. So groggy I couldn't go to work the next day_ nearly fell in the bathroom_ didn't dare drive. Tried to give it a week to get used to it but gave up after 4 days. They listed 10 possible side effects and I had 9_ on the way to all 10. Hate this stuff.,F,56,4  days,3/30/2004,Serzone
115, 3, anxiety and PMS,This stuff helped mildly with anxiety but not a huge difference.  It helped more w/my pms then anxiety but it still wasn't enough to totally get rid of my pms and sometimes I would get irate or irritable for no reason any time of the month but atleast I didnt' become physically violent.  I didn't want to take it all month long at the dose I was taking it at due to the liver warnings and also I can take meds for pms half the month instead of all month if I take something besides serzone.,Wasn't quite worth taking it all month for my pms.

My libido had completely gone and even though I didn't have a major depression while on it_ I was still quite anxious and my feelings were generally very flat.  Serzone has given me back my sex drive and my feelings in a way where I can enjoy them without being overwhelmed by them.
