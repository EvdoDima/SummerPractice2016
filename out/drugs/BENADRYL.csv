0, 2, Sinus pressure congestion,Benadryl actually worked ok reliving sinus pressure.  But my  white blood cell and neutrophil count plummeted! WBC 4_000 neutrophil 2_500 before taking. Took for 4 months had regular blood test and Dr's office calls back that day WBC at 1_700 and neutrophils 300!! Scheduled me for bone marrow biopsy 7 days later tells me to stop taking Benadryl. Do research on line and see where a rare but severe side effect of antihistamines is what I have just described. At biopsy I tell Dr who has never heard of this effect to redo WBC count before biopsy. He reluctantly does preforms biopsy before getting blood results back. Comes back 20 minutes later and says WBC now at 3_600 and neutrophils at 2_200!!! Can't prove that eliminating the Benadryl 7 days previous caused my WBC to dramatically increase but I believe it was the cause.  This is a rare but severe side effect and just my unfortunate luck to be one of those few people who it happened to.,,M,59,120  days25mg 1X D,8/11/2016Email,Benadryl

My mom_ as well as our family doctor_ told me to take some Benadryl for a few days to help with the itchiness and swelling. It helped the swelling_ and a little bit of the itchiness.. But the side effects that came with it are worse than how I was before I took the pill! It was so hard to lift my own hand_ and it was like I was an empty shell_ as I could barely feel my body.

The nurses were quite concerned. The nurses now reduced my dose to 20mg and push it over 20 minutes. That makes every thing less severe.

11, 1, Post Nasal drip_ Allergies & Sleep,	None at first_ but after continual use I was diagnosed with Rosacea_ sometime had very dry skin that cracked_ some hair loss_ lower libido_ increased breathing issues sometimes (thought it was my asthma)_ inner ear pressure and problems hearing with tinnitus_ numb toes and hands_ foggy head_ severe memory loss/ forgetfulness_ mild depression_ tension in neck (thought it was from old injury)_ inability to relax_ pounding heart  for no reason during day_ chronic fatigue (diagnosed with narcolepsy)_ extreme irritability_ blurry vision which occurred occasionally but not always (my ability to focus changed when I increased the dose). Side affects appeared several years into continual and increased use. I wish that I had known sooner. I do not know if my early menopause was caused by it and if I will have permanent memory issues now that use of this medication was linked to dementia. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and my calve muscles hurt very bad like I pulled them. DO NOT USE THIS DRUG_,I took very small doses of Benadry over 20 years_ maybe 3 MG each night and did not experience really bad side effects. I felt like I was in a fog sometimes but was able to sleep and function without problems with my post nasal drip which is extremely bad and triggers my asthma. In the past 3 years I increased my dosage and did not realize that the medication was affecting me. It is a horrible drug and I did try to find information_ like is on this site_ but did not find any negative information. If I had_ I would have stopped taking it altogether years ago.,F,50,20  years15 MG 1X D,4/28/2016Email,Benadryl
12, 1, Allergy Related-Symptoms: Watery ey,Two decades ago_ when I took Benadryl for allergies such as watery eyes_ itchy related symptoms_ I experienced fast heart-beat rates. About two weeks' ago_ I decided to try after having problems with other Allergy medications and nose sprays_ this time_ it prevented me from completely able to sneeze. Whenever_ I tried to sneeze_ I was unable to do so in its entirety. Also_ two decades ago_ my son_ 3 at the time_ experienced an alarming side-effect from the Benadryl Suspension prescribed. He was unable to urinate until later even with his pediatrician and an urologist's interventions.,After the fast heartbeat rates in the past and my son's experience_ I promised that I would never take Benadryl again. Moreover_ I took a pharmaceutical drug class_ which I learned that my experience and my son's experience_ are some of the side-effects of Benadryl. Further_ it did not completely treat all of my allergy symptoms; my itchy nostrils. These allergy treatable drugs seem somehow helpful_ but from my and son's experience causes devastating effects.,F,55,2  days4 Tablets 1X H,4/7/2016,Benadryl

Our ER Dr's are idiots anyway! I will politely decline if they ever try to give me this again! I dispute the comment about people with anxiety will find problems with sugar pills. Just because people have anxiety doesn't mean that they are stupid and can't differentiate between anxiety symptoms and symptoms related to medications and other reasons. I am so sick of people with anxiety being treated like idiots because of a disease that NONE of chose to have. There are usually reason that people have anxiety. EG.. ptsd_ depression etc.. Which usually comes down to extremely bad things happening in a persons life. Like me for instance_ I was robbed at gunpoint_ beaten by an ex husband and just had a very bad car accident where a dump truck landed on our car and dumped thousands of quarry rocks on top of us as well. I also came very close to losing My Moma in that accident. Praise God I didn't! Then lost my Dad a few months ago and now My Brother having had open heart surgery at the age of 47 and now waiting for a pace maker and defibrillator. These are the reasons people have these issues! Not because We choose to have it! We would do almost anything to live normally! And we aren't idiots_ we can distinguish the difference in our anxiety issues and other medical issues! So don't judge!  You  never know what has happened in someones life   to cause these problems!   ""Judge not",F,38,1  days50 mg iv 1X D,1/19/2016Email,Benadryl

29, 5, Insomnia,Dry nasal_ sleepiness (which is what I wanted_ so not complaining) Sometimes if taken too much I get a small stomach ache which is easily fixed by grabbing something to eat. Which is good because a lot of the times I forget to eat due to my depression.,I personally love Benadryl. I have terrible insomnia_ to the point where I will be awake for days before crashing for a few hours. My body doesn't have an off button it seems. The only down side to this is my nose sometimes gets very dry and the stomach pains. Also_ after taking a certain amount (say 3 pills) for an extended period of time I become use to it and have to up the dosage. The highest I've gone would be 7 pills.(175mg) but this is easily fixed by stopping for a few days then returning to a smaller dose. Even though this shouldn't be used for long term use it is the only thing to help me sleep. The medications my doctors had prescribed me made me groggy and forgetful.

55, 1, Mild allergy,This drug is DANGEROUS. I had (am still having) a horrific and severely uncomfortable experience with it. Two nights ago I felt like I was having some allergy symptoms_ I took 25 mg of Benadryl and went to sleep. I woke up shortly after with my heart racing and in sheer panic_ I thought the allergy might have been coming back_ I took another 25 mg of Benadryl. I then started to feel like I couldn't breathe_ my body was shaking uncontrollably and I was rashy (I didn't realize then that this was a reaction to Benadryl). I went straight to the ER. I told them I was having an allergic reaction and I had taken 50 mg of Benadryl_ they administered 50 mg more of Benadryl through IV. Once it hit my system_ my vision became extremely blurry_ my body felt extremely heavy and like I was endlessly falling through the bed_ I was sweating profusely_ and my heart was racing. I couldn't speak to tell the nurse. I started having vivid nightmares while my eyes were still open. I was shaking and unable to move or speak. I felt like I was dying. I could not think clearly_ and my scalp was crawling. These symptoms eventually subsided and I went home. Yesterday and this morning_ I have been having waves of severe symptoms where I can't walk_ see_ and speak. I sweat_ heart races_ have diarrhea_ legs twitch and tingle. I am still groggy and foggy brained. I know doctors can't do much about it because my vitals are fine so I have to ride out my symptoms and allow my body to detox,THIS DRUG IS POWERFUL.

I took the Benadryl about 11 PM both nights and then went to bed.  I got 6 - 7 hours of sleep both nights.  However_ each day after I had taken Benadryl the night before_ I had no energy.  I could hardly keep my eyes open at work and I was lethargic.  I almost told my boss I was sick_ so I could go home because I was so exhausted.  Benadryl cures my allergy symptoms_ which is why I rated it a ""4""_ but I won't take it again unless I don't have work (or anything important) the next day.",F,32,2  days25 MG 1X D,12/29/2014,Benadryl
