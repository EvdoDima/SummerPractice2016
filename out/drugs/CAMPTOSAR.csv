0, 1, My Dad for Metastatic Lung Cancer,Horrible Drug - nearly killed him after 4 rounds of this chemo drug.  Awful side effects_ nausea_ vomiting_ severe diarrhea and gastro intestinal cramping and horrendous suffering and pains.,Would not recommend to any member of my family - we had to take my dad to the ER and they brough him slowly back from near death after 4 days.  Low Red Blood and White blood cell count_ anemia_ dehydration_ vomiting_ loss of appetite_ severe weight loss_ depression_ hair loss_ ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE IN THE CANCER - the last scan showed NO TUMOR REDUCTION OR SHRINKAGE - what a waste of time money and the cost of my poor father's suffering - fda should put better warnings on this drug to alert patients of the dangers.,M,65,1  months,9/5/2008,Camptosar
