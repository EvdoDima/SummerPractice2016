0, 5, Copd,Runny nose but not sure if it is from Breo,I can finally breath! I have been taking adair for years and using my rescue inhaler at least 3 x a day. I could hardly walk any distance because I would be out of breath after a short time . After taking Breo I can actually  walk and even run without being short of breath. No more wheezing also. I love this medicine _ hardly ever use my rescue inhaler any longer.,F,68,60  days 1X D,2/3/2016Email,Breo ellipta
1, 3, COPD Emphysema,Constant raspy cough with some mucus that did not exist before starting this medicine.,While it does help significantly with the shortness of breath_ I may have to discontinue if the cough continues or worsens.  Feels almost like bronchitis.   I am hoping that this is only temporary as my lungs get used to this medicine.,M,60,2  months 1X D,11/26/2015,Breo ellipta
2, 4, COPD Emphysema,None really_ except for a minor sore throat at times and occasional minor dry cough,It does seem to be helping and I am less short of breath.,M,63,2  months 1X D,10/26/2015,Breo ellipta
