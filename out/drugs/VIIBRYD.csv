2, 5, Anxiety and Depression,None really,This drug has been a miracle for me.  Zoloft stopped working after taking it for 10 years and I slipped into depression and severe anxiety again the last two years without realizing it.  Took this and very quickly got relief from the depression but esp the crippling anxiety.  This med works amazingly well for both anxiety and depression plus there's no sexual side effects.  I hope it keeps on working.,M,7,9  months40mg 1X D,6/10/2016Email,Viibryd
3, 1, Major depression,Dropping thingsSleep paralysisRestless leg syndromeNotable weight gainAuditory hallucinations,"From the very start_ I had many side effects that I have never experienced with any other anti-depressant I have been on before (several).The first most notable one was dropping things. Several times a day. Specific types of items_ fruit_ glassware and cups. Anything that required a grasp around a surface. I dropped fruit every single morning while preparing meals for for my kids .I broke most of my glassware and spilled to go cups and water bottles almost daily in publicI spilled things almost daily. just slip out of my hand without any warning or more general notable weakness of grip It would ""give way"".I also began having sleep paralysis early on before I hit full dosing. I've had it a few times in my life without meds and it's always a terrible experience. But imuch worse on Viibryd. Skip this dug altogether if you are prone to panic attacks . It's absolutely awful. I was aware but not quite awake and unable to move. For tremendously long periods Upon falling asleep and during the night.It was claustrophobic and terrifying at times even though I knew what it was. There were a few nights that it was so bad_ I was scared to try to go back to sleep after 3 consecutive episodes. I was fully aware and able to talk myself through it_ even then_ the feeling of being trapped and not in control is extremely unpleasant. And losing sleep is the last thing that helps my depression.And also_ despite the packaging claims_ I gained a notable amount of weight RAPIDLY",F,47,5  months40mg,5/26/2016,Viibryd
4, 2, Depression,Tinnitis_ sleep paralysis_ tiredness,I was on Viibryd twice and the first time it did help with depression_ but made me feel almost numb to everything. The first time I was on it for several months with no side effects except sexually. I went off for that reason and to see if I really needed to be on an antidepressant anymore. I was fine for quite awhile_ but the depression did come back due to alot of family and health problems_ so I went back on Viibryd and found this time that it made no difference with my depression. I have tinnitus anyway and it made that worse_ and then came the sleep paralysis that I didn't have the first time I took it.  I didn't know what was causing that and researched it and found that other people on Viibryd were experiencing the same thing. If you've never experienced sleep paralysis count yourself lucky. It's terrifying and it would happen even if I was just dozing_ not even fully asleep_ on the sofa watching TV. I have since gone off of this drug. I don't think it caused any weight gain for me_ but the side effects that really started the second time with no relief from depression were enough for me to never want to be on any of these drugs again.,F,70, 20mg 1X D,5/22/2016,Viibryd
5, 4, Major Depression,With 20mg I experienced major irritability.  When I went to 40 mg_ I experienced Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). My Dr. cut me back to 20mg and the RLS went away.,I cut back from 40mg to 20mg recently. Will hopefully be fine on 20mg with no side effects. Fingers crossed!,F,57,2  months40 then 20 1X D,5/18/2016,Viibryd
6, 1, ,Sleep paralysis_ Night terrors,Was afraid to go to sleep for fear of dreaming about being paralyzed in my dreams by some unknown demon like force trying to abduct me or experiment on me.I knew I was dreaming but i couldn't wake myself up.I kept screaming and crawling to someone to wake me up while I watched myself lay there_ but it was only in my head they couldn't hear me.It was vivid dreams like being stuck in a horror sci-fi movie. Very scary stuff!,F,40,10  days,5/15/2016Email,Viibryd
7, 4, Major Depressive Disorder,Nausea_ itchy scalp_ diarrhea,My doctor suggested this as an alternative to all of the other medications I've tried and hated over the years (Celexa_ Prozac_ Lexapro_ Lamictal- all made me gain a ton of weight_ to the point where my depression would return). This is the first drug I've taken that I am happy with. No weight gain_ no sexual side effects. I do have to take it after I eat_ otherwise I feel nauseous. I also take it in the morning_ because when I was taking it at night it gave me crazy dreams. The first few months were frustrating_ because it bothered my stomach and one drink would make me feel incredibly hungover. But after probably three months_ most of that subsided. I hope with all of my heart that it keeps working for me for the long haul_ because I haven't felt this normal in years- and I don't want it to go away.,F,28,1  years10mg 1X D,5/8/2016Email,Viibryd
8, 1, MDD/Anxiety,It worked for my depression_ BUT...the withdrawal side effects were debilitating. Vertigo_ wanted to scratch my skin off my body_ brain zaps_ overwhelming fatigue_ tinnitus_ headache_ brain fog_ nausea. Within 2 days of not having the medication_ I was completely unable to function on my own. I had to have my sister go and pick up my prescription for me_ because I was unable to walk without holding onto walls_ let alone get in the car and drive. Within 30 minutes of taking the medication_ my symptoms had started to subside.,I finally decided to come off the medication_ and worked with my psychiatrist to gradually wean me off the medication. I went from 40mg_ to 20mg for two weeks_ to 10mg for two weeks_ then discontinued the medication.  I had the same withdrawal symptoms as before_ just not as severe_ but there was one symptom that I still experience now_ a month off the meds...which is the periodic sensation that my body is trying to jump thru my skin. My thoughts are clear_ and I feel a lot better knowing that I'm off the medication. This is a medication that I would not suggest for my worst enemy to take. The withdrawal side effects are horrible. It needs to come with black box warnings to let people know that they should NOT stop taking the medication abruptly.,F,49,2  years40mg 1X D,4/25/2016Email,Viibryd
9, 1, deppression,severe anxiety_ sleep deprivation_ intense anger and rage_ muscle aches_ electric brain clicks__ nightmares_ feeling worthless_ hopeless_ could not stop crying and hallucinations.,"PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!  I wanted to die.  I am 66 years old and have never had such horrible side effects in over 40 years of being on and off of antidepressants.  Who in heaven's name would put out such a horrendous drug that is suppose to help people?  I called my Dr. after being on Viibryd for 16 days:  10mg for 7 days_ 20mg for 7 days and 40mg for two days and told him I cannot_ would not continue taking this drug.  The nurse asked me why_ and after reciting the list of severe anxiety_ heart racing_ could not sleep_ agitation_ intense anger and rage_ body aches_ incessant headache_ feelings of a broken heart_ worthlessness_ pacing around_ couldn't sit for even 5 minutes_ and the worst of all_ was seeing my dead brother in my back yard_ the Dr. came back and said_ ""yes_ stop!""  I am still experiencing awful side effects_ can't get myself together.  A hanger fell out of the closet and hit my hand_ and I cursed like I a sailor using mf_ all the ""C"" words relating to men and womens' sexual organs.  My husband stood there_ stunned_ as I fast-paced around the room_ then I broke down crying hysterically  and apologizing to him.  Please do not take this drug!

13, 1, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Brain zaps if missed a dose.  20 lb weight gain.  Intense sugar/carb cravings.  Sexual side effects (no orgasm) Gastric issues.  Bloating.  Fatigue.,Stay far away from this drug!!  I've lost 21 lbs and my stomach is no longer bloated/inflamed since going off this drug.  I had numerous lab tests because I thought I had major gastric problems - turned out it was just the drug!  I no longer crave sugar like a heroin addict.  I feel pretty normal now_ but am on Bupropion for depression_ so that helps.  I vowed to tell everyone to stay away from this drug.  It may help anxiety_ but it's HORRIBLE in every other way.,F,37,4  years40 mg 1X D,3/28/2016Email,Viibryd
14, 4, MDD,Some weight gain_ approx 15 pounds. I'm not sure I can blame the med for that.,Viibryd has helped a LOT. I can get up in the morning! I have increased energy and am able to tolerate being around people. I still have some issues with depression but I am so much better. I have taken many antidepressants over the last 20 years and I have to say this is definitely one of the best.,F,59,2  years40 mg 1X D,3/8/2016,Viibryd

16, 1, Recurring major depresion,"Excess need for sleep but still tired/sluggish/sleepy. Slightly reduced performance at work due to tiredness_ lack of energy_ difficulty getting up to go to work due to sleepiness. Occurring rarely: vivid dreams; occasionally ""trapped in a dream"" where I can wake up but can't escape the dream - afraid to fall back asleep but can't become lucid. Missed dose 2 different times - loss of work because of extreme eye itching_ itchiness_ dizziness_ vertigo_ brain zaps_ fatigue_ diarrhea. I went off this drug for 2 weeks and had frequent brain zaps_ extreme lethargy_ itchiness_ vertigo_ dizziness. I thought my symptoms were from going back to my old drug but have now realized it was Viibryd withdrawal.",DO NOT MISS A DOSE OR TAKE A DOSE LATE! EVER! Missing a single dose and being late to take the next resulted in loss of a day and a half of work due to the severe eye itchiness_ itchiness_ vertigo_ dizziness_ tiredness_ brain zaps_ diarrhea. I am terrified of being on this drug and more terrified to go off. The lethargy when trying to go off this drug was EXTREME and the brain zaps were occurring several times daily  frequently literally one right after another after another and the vertigo was frequent and a bit scary as I would feel like I was going to fall or pass out. Viibryd works for my depression but the side effects and consequences of missing a dose or being late to take a dose are scary and result in loss of work. I am known at work for my energy and drive. I am not quite that person when on Viibryd because of feeling so tired. I don't know what to do. I see my doctor in 3 weeks and want off this drug but am very scared of the withdrawal effects - how long they last and how strong they are. From what I have read of patient comments on various websites_ there is no escaping them.  I wish I never met this drug. ,M,46,3  weeks20 1X D,2/17/2016EmailHistory,Viibryd
17, 3, Depression,Insomnia_ brain zaps_ vivid dreams_ dizziness_ vertigo,Started this drug on 10mg_ made my stomach upset at first but only the first day or two. Worked my way up to 40mg and i had good results at first. Insomnia is manageable if you can stay on a morning schedule with it but You have to eat with it and I hardly ever had much for breakfast so I took it with dinner. I started having vivid dreams which most of the time I enjoyed. If I missed a dose or if I was late taking my pill the withdrawals would start. Most of the time it would start  with vertigo or dizziness or sometimes not at all but taking tthe pill right away would fix it. However.. I could never miss a dose.. if I fell asleep and missed a dose then I would have brain zaps. They would trap me in my nightmares. TERRIFYING nightmares. I was unable to wake myself up and when I did finally wake up I wouldn't be sure if I was still dreaming or not. I stopped taking the medicine because I worry about being dependent on it for the rest of my life and I can't deal with the withdrawals if I forget to take it or if something were to happen where I wasn't able to take it one night..not to mention the price of the pill. I tried to taper off but couldn't take the brain zaps so I ended up back on it but quit cold turkey recently because I ended up drinking that night and forgot to take the pill and passed out... Which I highly do not recommend! However I did make it through that night without feeling or noticing the brain zaps! Now just stuck with this never ending dizziness..,F,24,3  months40,2/14/2016,Viibryd
18, 4, Anxiety,When I was on 40mg it was too much for me.  I felt very wired and didn't sleep well. I cut it down to 20mg before I saw my Dr. again and I felt a little less anxious.  My Dr.  Then told me to cut it down to 10mg.  I am feeling much better with this dosage.  I feel less anxious and sleeping better.,I think you need to try this at different dosage levels and see if it works for you.,F,65,1  days10,2/10/2016,Viibryd

20, 2, Major depression,Nausea_ diarrhea_ and upset stomach for first couple of weeks. Then those went away. Sleeping issues: see below.,This medicine has done a very good job at making my depression bearable. However_ if I were to ever miss a dose_ I would know as soon as I fell asleep. I would have a horrible and vivid night terror that I couldn't wake up from. When I would finally wake up_ I had only been asleep for 10 maybe 20 minutes. This happened multiple times. Naps were no longer an option because I would wake up from them and hallucinate and not really be sure if I was still dreaming or not. I feel like I have begun to lose touch with reality. I can't tell the difference from things that I have dreamt or things that have actually happened. I absolutely love this drug for taking away my suicidal thoughts that had plagued me daily for months. But it is beginning to make me terrified. I have never had sleep issues before and have never experienced hallucinations this vivid.,F,23,4  months40MG,1/13/2016Email,Viibryd

In the last month_ I've been sleeping alot_ low on energy_ can't even fix myself a meal. I get overwhelmed with trying to do the simplest test_ such as making myself a meal. It's hard to do anything simple_ I was able to do before. I'm getting off of the Viibryd tomorrow and will try Cymbalta.,F,38,6  months40 mg,11/22/2015Email,Viibryd
22, 2, Severe depression_ eating disorder,I initially agreed to try out Viibryd because my psychiatrist promised me it had no effect on weight. WRONG! Within the first week I gained three pounds_ and I wasn't eating anything differently.,i just won't put up with any drug that causes weight gain_ so I stopped it.,F,24,7  days,11/20/2015,Viibryd
23, 3, Major Depression/Severe Anxiety,It's a nightmare with my insomnia.,I've been on Viibryd for 2 years_ it's extremely expensive with my insurance however my doctor assured me this medication was exactly what I needed for my disorder. I fully committed myself to this medication because my disease was breaking me down. I had been on Zoloft_ Welbutrin_ Lexapro...and I was tired of trying all these different drugs. And I was still having panic attacks and crying all day. It took all I had to contain myself just to go to work everyday. My point is_ I just don't think Viibryd works! I've been on it for 2 years and I'm in the same place_ mentally. Still having panic attacks and breakdowns with an empty wallet. I have an appointment next week with my Primary Doctor to research something else.,F,38,2  years40 mg 1X D,11/14/2015Email,Viibryd
24, 3, Major depression,Rapid weight gain_ brain zaps_ intense craving for sugar.,I started it after I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. At the time I was on Lexapro and Wellbutrin_ and was weaned off of these medications while I was going up on Viibryd. For the first nine months or so it seemed to do its job_ but then I noticed that I started to get mood swings that caused my therapist to believe I may have some sort of borderline personality symptoms. I started to show signs of suicidal thoughts as well and have since started tapering down on the drug_ as this was an indication that it was no longer working. I am down to 10 mg at the moment and I have noticed that I no longer crave sugar constantly_ my weight has slowly started to drop_ and the side effects of tapering are minimal. Overall_ it would have been a good short-term drug. I don't believe I should have been on it for this long. It was also VERY expensive even with my insurance!,M,21,1  years40 mg,11/14/2015,Viibryd

26, 4, Anxiety/heaviness in my head,I'm so surprised by all of the serious side effects everyone is reporting.  I had some jittery legs and nausea for the first 2 days and I could tell it was changing things in my body_ but after that I had more energy_ could get out of bed in the morning_ able to concentrate and do my work.  About the 3rd month I did have some interesting nightmares_ but I'm a vivid dreamer anyway_ so I didn't find that to be too much out of the ordinary.  I've had no weight gain_ but my appetite has lessened.  Other than that I've had no unusual symptoms or complications with this drug.,I feel like it has helped but not sure how long I'll stay on it.,F,54,120  days20mg 1X D,11/2/2015,Viibryd

28, 2, Major Depressive Disorder,Extreme nausea. Sensitivity to smell and motion. Occasional diarrhea. Daily episodes of gagging/dry-heaving. Intense stomach pain. Symptoms were moderate in the beginning but worsened over the months it was taken_ ultimately becoming unbearable and preventing me from living normally.  Decrease in dosage did not stop side effects.,A functional anti-depressant taken since others had caused weight gain. Although the weight gain stopped and it was effective in it's treatment of depression_ the side-effects worsened over the period of use to the point where it did more harm than good.,M,25,5  months40 1X D,11/2/2015,Viibryd
29, 5, depression,when i began taking it diarrhea was pretty common. i had a few very vivid dreams during that time as well. after about a month or so_ both of those side effects wore off and i was feeling better than ever. i've missed a dose a few times by accident and that'd usually mean i was spending the rest of the day crying around the house and nothing more. i was on cymbalta for awhile and if i ever missed a dose my whole day would be hell and i'd feel so sick. i'd get hot flashes and would become extremely nauseous but  none of that happened with viibryd.. which was a relief. another side effect is that maybe only once a month or so i sleep for 16 hours straight. nothing anyone does can wake me. i'm not complaining of having the most relaxing sleep session ever but it can get in the way of daily responsibilities. but other than that_ viibryd has really helped me cope with my depression and i'd wake up feeling like i could face the day on a regular basis.. the diarrhea is totally worth it.,i've been switched over to effexor xr recently because my insurance doesn't want to cover viibryd. i feel like shit compared to when i was on it. cymbalta also sucks.,F,23,8  months40 mg 1X D,10/31/2015Email,Viibryd

My hands shook so much I woke my husband up. I felt like I had ants crawling on my scalp. I spent the next 4 days so nauseated I couldn't eat anything. Messed me up for a week.

36, 4, Severe Depression,Diarrhea_ leg cramps_ sweet cravings_ weight gain_ hungry all the time_ suicudal thoughts- preoccupation with weird thoughts,For the first 1.5 years it was great. I could actually think clearly_ brain function was normal_ I felt like a normal person. The side affects of the leg cramps_ and potty problems were worth it. My doctor had me taking 40mg one day and 30mg the next. If I took 40 everyday the leg cramps were unbearable. I Gained over 40 pounds it looked like I was 7 months pregnant_ the fat gain was a lot and it happened over the 1st year on the drug. I would walk 3 to 5 miles at least 5 times a week and the weight would not budge - no matter if I ate a little_ normal_ or a lot. Then the bad thoughts came so I started weaning off drug my doctor has done it slowly_ first week_ 30mg and 20 mg alternating days - next week 20 mg this week has been alternating days of 20 mg and 10 mg - next week will be 10 mg everyday - then alternating 10mg and nit taking any. This week I have had no demonic head parties and have actually seen a decrease in body fat and lost 4 pounds. Leg cramps are almost gone. The potty issues are better but I take diabetic mess that cause issues.  I did not realize until weaning that the drug was causing the food cravings. I do recommend the medicine but maybe just not for long term use. I am feeling good and still on my 150mg Wellbutrin SL,F,53,2.5  years40 mg 1X D,9/27/2015,Viibryd

No longer as moody and I'm able to be more outgoing.,Do NOT drink alcohol on medication you will be nauseous for two days trust me I learned the hard way dispite the fact it says not too anyways .

41, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Sever diarrhea_ especially after eating_gas_ difficulty in achieving orgasam_ and crazy fitful dreams.,I have been on just about every antidepressant made in the last 18 years. Viibryd has helped me more than anything I've ever tried! While there are side effects_ and they seem bad_ I went from wanting to die_ to living life for the first time in years! I started spitting my 40 mg tablets and taking 20 mg twice a day. The crazy dreams totally stopped! If I forget the night dose the dreams come right back. I could care less about the diarrhea and sexual side effects. Small price to pay to actually live again! Of course I haven't told my doctor anything about my side effects. I should probably do that!

42, 2, depression agitation,After starting taking meds terrible stomach cramps for weeks & finally subsided. If i didn't eat with meds I was nauseous_ if you forgot it 1 day you felt it.  I felt ok for the first few months_ of taking this Dr. said Viibryd would make me less sleepy & it did for awhile.  The brain freeze has been happening to me_ it's a very strange feeling of nothingness at times.  Irrational outbursts or crying episodes.

49, 1, Major depression,Terrible anxiety_ especially upon waking.Angry_ weight gain_ itching_ heart palpitations_ itching feet. Mood swings. High blood pressure where it had always been low before.,I have been taking some form of anti depressant for many years. This is by far the worst one I have ever been on. Others have made me gain weight_ fatigued_etc._ but none have ever made me feel like I was going insane like this drug has. I have never had so many symptoms hit me all at once and I couldn't decipher what was going on_ because I was dealing with the loss of my father and many other things. I'm so glad I read what other people had to say and realize now it wasn't me_ it was the medicine. This is a very dangerous drug. I noticed if I forgot to take it as soon as I woke up_ terrible side effects would occur. Anxiety_ panic attacks_ uncontrollable crying. These symptoms got so bad that I tried to commit suicide_ because I couldn't deal with what all that was going on inside my head and my body. Please do not take this drug. I am now being weaned off of it and trying to recover from all the aftermath of attempted suicide. This was totally out of character for me. I have not been myself at all the entire time I was on this drug. It's hard to know what's going on when there are a lot of outside factors you are dealing with. That is why it took me so long to figure out that it was the medicine. Even my doctor didn't see it.,F,51,6  months40 MG 1X D,7/2/2015Email,Viibryd

I had symptoms of a pinched nerve in both hands but worse in right. Felt like I had flu-- could barely walk some mornings- only with taking pain meds and a lot of ibuprofen.   All of this started after I went to 40 mg dose about 3 mo ago.   I could barely move in the middle of the night and in morning.  I went from being healthy to feeling like I was crippled.  And not one Dr knew what it was.  Finally I looked online to see if viibryd could cause pain-- and there is was-- all of my symptoms.  This crap should be illegal,drs should know about this.

64, 3, Depression and Anxiety and PTSD,Initially worked VERY well once I got to 40 mg. I felt like a New person! I could function again w/o anxiety & the heart palpitations stopped. That lasted about 3 months. Side effects_ which took me a while to realize_ were Extremely vivid dreams almost nightly and cry very easily from the start of the med.. I gained 25 lbs! I Crave carbs & sweets like never before & felt like I was on a steroid b/c I was starving all the time! My anxiety is back as bad as ever_ I want to sleep or stay in bed where it's safe but it's difficult to actually rest. I feel like I hate the world & stay angry/irritable. I physically hurt more than I've ever hurt in my life but that could be from lack of exercise which is nearly impossible to do b/c I hurt and I'm so tired. My back hurts_ my hips hurt_ my chest hurts_ my toes hurt_ & fingers hurt. My GP DR. said the eating is b/c of depression but this craving is NOT like when I'm depressed. Many days I think I just can't bare anymore and want to drive off a bridge! Paxil & Cymbalta made me feel the same way after a cpl yrs on those. I want to stop the medication but it causes serious brain zaps_ nausea_ vertigo_ when I miss a dose which happened for 3 days once when I went out of town & forgot my vybriid. My blood pressure is much higher_ it's always been low-normal so I feel like I'm going to explode physically at times & it's hard to breathe.

65, 4, MDD_ fibromyalgia_ chronic fatigue,Initially I had tremendous mood swings and impulsive behavior/speech.  Sometimes angry outbursts_ sometimes inappropriate comments (like I had no filters on my thoughts before speaking). Restless leg syndrome increased dramatically.  Scalp and skin itching. Same effects when increasing dosage to deal with SAD. Vivid dreams but not nightmares. Increased libido. Weight loss overtime (decreased appetite).  Missing even one day dosage can cause strange thoughts and mental confusion. Missed a week due to insurance foul up and thought I was going crazy.,This drug has significantly helped my depression after numerous other established antidepressants lost their effectiveness. Increased energy and finally interested in being with people and trying new things for the first time in years. With a steady dosage most adverse side effects went away except for RLS and the tendency to cry more easily both from harsh words from others and from happy_ sentimental triggers but much more controlled than during initial adjustment period. Take the time to explain this to your family. I suggest never changing dosage more than 10 mg at a time over 3-4 weeks and be prepared for side effects even then but much milder than initially.   I wonder if remaining on a lower dose for an even longer time would eventually be effective without so many side effects?   Don't miss a dose.  See if you can get samples to have on hand if you might experience delays in your insurance coverage.  Copayment is very expensive but this works effectively when other older meds no longer work. Insurance companies should make an exception for this or the manufacturer should offer rebates.  Manufacturer should continue studying this drug to find solution to adverse effects and why it works well for some people but is such a frightening experience for others.,F,51,7  months30mg,2/26/2015Email,Viibryd

I finally decided to see if this had anything to do with the med and HOLY CRAP! There are dozens and dozens of people experiencing these same shocks or brain zaps as they call them. It's a terrifying feeling. I also have the most vivid yet gruesome dreams if I miss a dose. I begin itching every evening prior to when I normally take my pill. I didn't know that was also a side effect until I read it here from so many others. I begin IOP treatment tomorrow & they are weaning me off of this horrible drug. I was nervous but after seeing that I'm far from being the only person to experience these specific effects_ I'm very ready to just throw it in the garbage.,I cannot recommend this drug at all after what it has caused me.

I swear she knew  I'd gain weight because she told me not to Google Viibryd (I did anyhow)_ but I decided to give it a chance. I am now convinced that every time Big Pharma develops a new_ unpatented antidepressant_ they claim ""No weight gain/sexual side effects!!!""_ because they KNOW they can get doctors to push this new_ expensive med_ before the ugly truth slowly gets around. They also KNOW that those 2 major issues are most patient's biggest concerns!!! LIES!!! Twenty years ago_ I believed my doctor when he said the same exact things about Prozac.

I was having seizures. ,This medication may work for some people. I personally went through hell. I had to figure out on my own that it was the Viibryd that was making me so extremely sick. I was not made aware of the serious side effects. And what's really unbelievable is that I went to the emergency room and was treated like a fool. I was so sick I had to have assistance walking. I was also put in the hospital but not One Dr. Had the sense to think it may be the Viibryd. I was vomiting right in front of them. My body was in pain and I was starving.I was desperate to know what was wrong with me.I had stomach problems previously and had been losing. didn't realize it was due to this medication. Because I didnt start noticing until September and I had been on it since July. One day I was wondering about the last medication I was put on because I am on other meds. Viibryd was the last one.

73, 5, Major Depressive Disorder,Vivid Dreams_ Nightmares when a dose is missed_ Fatigue,I started taking this drug due to suicidal thoughts and racing thoughts. I increased from the 10mg to 20 and then to 40 as recommended but after two days on the 40 I called my doctor and switched back down to 20 and have been on it ever since. The 40mg dose was just too high for me and caused extreme nausea to the point I didn't want to get out bed because I thought I was going to vomit nonstop. Before Viibryd_ nothing I did could quiet or calm my racing mind. I tried cytalopram (sp?)_ wellbutrin sr and xl and nothing worked. Within two days I could tell the difference and I still feel great. My mind is calmer_ I can rationally understand and solve problems before me without becoming overwhelmed. Even my husband approves of viibryd since my mood swings are now less frequent and I generally enjoy activities again. My work performance has also returned to high functioning. The only issue I have with the medicine is I would like to not be committed to meds for life and any time I miss a dose_ I spend the next day in bed sleeping as if I hadn't slept in a week and I have VIVID nightmares. The cost is also a little high if you don't have insurance which is another reason I want to stop taking it. Otherwise_ I love this medication.,F,33,8  months20 1X D,1/27/2015,Viibryd

Their reviews are useless and have no bearing on the drugs efficacy: at all! Having said that_ this drug as you titrate up to 40 mg (3rd week) will start off decent enough.. Then you may have up and down days_ and then... You will feel better the 3rd or 4th week( I have not reached that point yet) though the last few days have been very good_ indeed.tapering off cymbalta which works well but has a huge amount of side effects_ viibryd is an angel by comparison. Just some very insignificant stomach things that is no big deal by any means. Sex libido is good compared to others. If you watch your diet_ you probably will not gain weight.if you have or got restless legs from your previous medication_ say goodbye to it! Otherwise_ I will keep evaluating for another 2 weeks to see if I reach an ultimate plateau for symptoms to dissolve more completely; and either continue quite blissfully or make another change.,M,63,4  weeks40,1/7/2015Email,Viibryd
78, 5, Seasonal Affective Disorder,At first with 5-10 mg_(my doctor told me to cut all initial pills in half and slowly build resistance) nausea and intense stomach pains unless I took with a FULL meals worth of food. A snack is not enough for this. Eventually this went away_ returning a bit only when I increased the dosage to 10-20 mg. Eventually I increased to 40mg and found this to be way too much. The only difference I really felt was in the side effects rather than the benefits. I also take Vyvanse for ADD (which I absolutely LOVE)_ and found that I could not have ANY caffeine without feeling those brain zaps_ but those were usually fully avoided if I avoided caffeine and other similar stimulants completely. I also found a new sensitivity to sugar and alcohol. Occasionally I felt light-headed_ and I really think it was because of the interaction of the Viibryd and the Vyvanse. I also noticed that on both meds I crashed harder at the end of the day. Vivid_ VIVID DREAMS. The MOST VIVID DREAMS OF YOUR LIFE.  Bad_ good,I was previously on Lexapro and switched because I had issues with the sexual side effects. My sex drive and sensitivity improved almost immediately after my body adapted to the switch_ and I felt overall it worked similarly to the Lexipro without the sexual side effects. I found if I controlled my diet and sleep schedule as best I could_ I felt so good on the medication. I wondered why I hadn't pursued it sooner. Of course I still felt anxious sometimes because no drug is perfect_ but it was easier to calm myself down and push through it. Everything was easier to deal with. The longer I was on it (especially when regulated to 20 mg) the more balanced and less overwhelmed I felt. How I take this and how my body adapted to this worked for me_ but everyone is really different and handles this medication differently. I have really great results_ but it did take time. I do recommend giving this a try if its an option for you_ just be aware that you have to accommodate it in some ways_ and that might not necessarily be for you. I do also recommend a lower dosage if the side effects are too much_ and that is a viable option for you. Finally- make sure this will work with your insurance!

At 6'2_ I was never able to get down to 185 lb from 193_ and cymbalta brought me up and down_ no matter how healthy I ate. I still do not  know if this will keep up_ as initially_ cymbalta brought some weight loss also... Only to be regained  and a bit more after A few years on it. Time will tell. So far the medication is good at 2 weeks... Not great. Will see how it progresses,M,62,2  weeks20 mg,12/30/2014,Viibryd

82, 3, MDD & Anxiety,Severe insomnia_ vivid/disturbing dreams,This medication has worked wonders on my depressive symptoms. Unfortunately_ I cannot sleep without Trazodone. The dreams were so bad when I first started at 40mg_ and I woke up so frequently that I was ready to give up on the medication_ but I cut to 30mg and at least the nightmares went away. Now I just can't sleep. It also does nothing for anxiety/panic_ so I will probably have to switch off this medication.,,32,8  weeks30mg 1X D,12/25/2014,Viibryd
83, 3, Depression,The biggest side effect is_ as many of you have reported_ the 'brain-tremors' that are nothing less than debilitating. If I do wait a full 24 hours before taking my next dose_ I'm already experiencing mild shocks that quickly turn violent. Having said that_ the surprising thing is that it has actually helped my depression and stabilize my mood.  As long as I have it!,A few times now I've had to go a few days without it bc of the pharmacy lagging behind and I was completely immobilized. The brain tremors are seriously enough to make me feel like I'm losing my mind and hold on to reality_ it's as though my ability to reason or think rationally is severely compromised.  I have to fight the urge to start screaming at my loved ones_ it's a nightmare . It does help my depression but I'm starting to seriously question if it's worth being so severely dependent on it.,F,32,6  months40MG 1X D,12/10/2014,Viibryd

Electric shocks pounds your ear drums_ head or brain. and limbs.  I was scared by the feeling and the  loud noise I  heard_ also I was sitting on my sofa and it felt like someone had hit me in the back of my head and there was no one there to do such a thing I felt like it was something demonic happening to me I have not been able to sleep in over 24hours now. Also it feels like someone is pressing now on my body or inside of it. I complaint to my doctor and call the emergency to see if they would see me. Also I complain to the company Forest Pharm_INC.1800-678-1605.I want you all to know that I feared for my life and I have most of the symptoms that most of you mention. I have depression but I rather not take any meds for it. I'll just crash a buffet with my woes.  Trust your body have family and friends document your behavior.  I had the sample pack,Nerves on edge_ and I breathe heavily and I'm only sitting down.I'm done trusting doctors with my issues.  I stopped it cold due to my doctors advice.

I am usually able to disregard what my ex husband and his family are doing behind my back_ but I actually can't get it out of my mind for even an hour. I want to do serious harm to him and his family.  I am angry. I have bad thoughts constantly. One day about a week before my period_ I get so close to suicide.  I have the plan ready. The plan is detailed and easy cleanup. The only thing that keeps me from ending my life is knowing that my ex husband and his family will win.  Every day is a chore to live through. This medication has made my depression off the charts. I hate hate hate living my life every hour_ minutes thinking of life being nothing but pure hell.

I became horribly dependent on Viibryd; if I didn't take it within 15 minutes of when I was supposed to_ I would experience dizziness_ brain-zaps_ muscle-spasms_ but the worst was the drowsiness. I would get extremely tired_ but if I laid down at all_ I would experience horrifying sleep paralysis. After lowering my dosage down to 20mg the side effects went away_ but I felt it was not very effective in treating my depression then. Definitely wouldn't recommend taking it.,M,22,8  months40mg 1X D,12/2/2014,Viibryd

For over 20 yrs I have been on a mild dose of antidepressants.  Having weight issues my doctor prescribed viibryd.  After starting with the 10mg and then progressing to 20mg and then finally to the 40mg dose I have to say for a while side effects were ok although I had a feeling that I was not really myself.  Until I really took some time to analyze the symptoms I didn't realize how very strange things had gotten.  It wasn't until the irrational anger and quick mood swings happened along with the crazy dreams and what some are describing as brain snaps that I knew I didn't want to stay on the medication.  Insomnia has been wicked and the lack of motivation and fatigue are incredible.  Please try something else before viibryd.,F,45,3  months40mg 1X D,11/17/2014,Viibryd

I had a predisposition with depression but after losing my father and having a miscarriage in the same year where I had to find a new job left me reeling and feeling totally lost. My Dr. subscribed this to me after my D&C_ and I thought I'd hit the jackpot. Over the 1st month_ I worked up to 40mg_ stayed there for a month_ then found that I was extremely bloated and not feeling like myself at all. Crying_ fits of severe anger finally led my husband to gently suggest I titrated off. I began to_ then I was able to see how horrible I'd been feeling without recognizing it at all.

After trying Wellbutrin_ which caused me to go off the charts with rage and aggravation_ my psychiatrist gave me a sample of this drug. I started out at 10mg and saw no real difference_ so I gradually moved up until I was at 40mg_ where I am experiencing a complete lack of motivation and will to take care of myself and worsened depression. On one hand_ I am more able to get over things that hurt me_ but there's this hopeless_ apathetic haze that has taken over that often leads me to doing nothing more than sitting on the computer. I can't bring myself to take care of myself_ and it is an intense struggle to even attend my classes_ or go out. I am not entirely sure the Viibryd is to blame. It might also be the Viibryd interacting with the Adderall and Lomedia I am taking. I am unsure about continuing this drug or not_ especially considering how many people have posted about what a nightmare it is to wean off of it. Guess I just have to talk to my psychiatrist.

Two days of withdrawals  made me decide I will never go thru that again_ itchiness_ crying jags_ chills_ nightmares. I have been off it a week and will never take it again because I do not want to be at the mercy of Insurance or jumping thru hoops to get samples. I don't think it was working anymore anyway.

133, 4, depression_ anxiety,In the first month of taking Viibryd_ I experienced nausea_ dizziness_ difficulty concentrating_ vivid dreams (nightmares) with one or two instances of very minor sleep paralysis_ increased appetite_ and weight gain. The dizziness_ trouble concentrating_ and nightmares all got worse when I briefly increased to 40mg_ but after about two months on 20mg all the side effects disappeared_ except for the weight gain.,Overall Viibryd has worked much better for me than Lexapro ever did. My anxiety isn't completely under control yet (I'm starting Zoloft in addition to the Viibryd to see if that helps)_ but my depression hasn't been a problem at all with the Viibryd except when it's triggered by anxiety. I did gain_ and keep_ about 25lbs_ but my weight has been stable for about a year now. If I stop taking the Viibryd for three or more days (if I'm so stressed that I forget_ or if I'm out and can't get it refilled)_ the nightmares resume for a night or two when I start taking it again.,F,30,18  months20 mg 1X D,3/25/2014,Viibryd

Pros- Everything was normal until the 40mg dose. I was normal_ better_ but I am afraid to sleep now because of my nightmares/terrors/paralysis from the meds. Plus more anxious and depressed.,At first it was a miracle but after starting the 40mg_ I became confined to bed and never wanted to wake up. Then I would have such vivid night mares_ I knew I was dreaming yet I was asleep I couldn't move or speak and would hear/see things that I can't describe because I am to scared to think of them. You think movies can be scary_ try being trapped in a sleep where you can't wake up or think you have finally woken up only to be still trapped in a nightmare.

I started experiencing sleep paralysis and really vivid dreams during the second month. The sleep paralysis only occurred if I was very tired and had stayed up much later than normal. The vivid dreams are kind of fun. I have really noticed a significant weight gain and I look like in pregnant. I have gas constantly. The pressure never goes away anymore. I am also having daily problems with acid reflux. I even woke up partially choking on stuff that came up whe I was asleep. I have had it with this med. in bummed because it is the only drug I have found that doesn't emotionally flatten me out. I hary ever take my jlonopin anymore and I have been on that for years. This weight is making me feel like shit about myself though.

At 10mg_ I felt very calm_ but there was dizziness.  It wasn't enough to cause me to stop the drug.  Once increased to 40mg_ I felt good for awhile_ but if I was late taking a pill or missed one_ I became extremely depressed and suicidal.  I would have these very emotional outbursts and I had very strong suicidal thoughts.  I also began experiencing restlessness in my arms and especially my legs if I took my pill after a certain time of day - I'd say if I took my pill before 2pm I would sleep fine_ but if I didn't allow a full 8 hours for the meds to be in my system before I went to bed_ I would have horrible restless legs_ and I have never had that issue in my life.I decided to tweak my dosage a bit_ and I feel much better.  I take the 40mg pill once every 48 hours rather than 24.  I have found that taking a 40mg every other day works much better for me.  I don't feel any anxiety and have not had anymore suicidal thoughts for the past three weeks.  I actually feel really good_ but I still have to be careful about the time I take the pill in order to get good sleep at night.  My diarrhea has also gone away.I think one of my issues was that prior to starting Viibryd_ I was already eating a lot of foods that can help produce serotonin (eggs_ spinach_ beans_ nuts_ ect...)_ so maybe I was kind of over-loaded with it in my brain.

On Viibryd_ once I reached 40 mgs_ I was experiencing sleep paralysis almost every day_ sometimes multiple times in a single night.  The paralysis on Viibryd was more frightening than prior instances because it felt like it was occurring with my eyes open in certain instances so that I could see visual images around me.  A few times it felt as if I was lying on top of another person or another person on me.  Upon awakening I could confirm that wife was on other side of bed. One of the most creepy meds I have taken.

I was very very irritable and angry. Everyone annoyed me and I wanted to be confrontational and let people know their problem. Right then I knew I had to stop. Also the loose stools started on day 1 and never stopped. Panic and anxiety were worse than baseline. For some reason I had to take Xanax every night just to feel sane. Those panicked feelings also made me feel...unstable. Like my mind was darting all over the place impulsively. I also felt....dark. Like this despair_ as is everything was wrong about my life. Insomnia and crazy_ vivid_ bad dreams. I'd wake up disturbed and slowly realize they didn't happen in real life. Cystic acne started showing up on my face and back.

167, 5, Major depression and anxiety,Maybe some weight gain (8 lbs). It's hard to tell because I initially gained 12 pounds in a month while on Zoloft. I lost a few of that when I stopped the Zoloft_ so I feel that this weight is still remaining from Zoloft.,I was having full-blown panic attacks and major depression before Viibryd. I felt relief within one day. I have tried too many meds to list. I can't speak to the joint pain that others have mentioned_ because I already had that due to Rheumatoid Arthritis. I have stayed with 10mg for a couple of months. I'm finally moving up to the 20mg because I would like to see if I get even more relief from my depression issues with the higher dose. I have not had any issues mentioned by others_ except the increased appetite and cravings for certain foods for the first month. I have read lots of negative reviews_ but to those who have tried other meds_ and haven't been satisfied_ I would at least give Viibryd a try. Worked very quickly for me_ and I don't feel medicated. I take my dose in the morning with food_ since I read that food really helps with the absorbency of the med. I think 20mg is as high as I will go. I think that 40mg should not necessarily be your goal. If you can get relief from a lower dose_ just stay there. It looks like a lot of people who have reported negative things are at 40mg.

Also noticed maybe more clenching of teeth/jaw grinding at night.  Not good sleep at all and yes very vivid and kinda scary dreams.

I tapered up with the kit_ going from 10mg to 20mg then on to 40mg. The 10 and 20 seemed fine and the 20 were when I actually felt happy-but literally I think that lasted like a week or 2 before the bad side effects began. And when I say side effects I'm talking stuff like I've never imagined. Terrifying does not even come close to describing the nightmares you get while on this. I still_ 4 months into it_ have brain zaps nightly_ a strange taste in my mouth that occurs as if to remind me I need to take my vybriid_ tiredness_ irritability-all of which I could handle. But I can NOT handle feeling like I'm going to die every night. This med causes a symptom called sleep paralysis. It's where your body feels paralyzed and you feel as though you're not breathing but  your brain is fully functioning. You try to scream or wake yourself up but you can't move. It is a horrible thing to experience once_ but on this medicine you win the sleep paralysis lotto!! As for my depression_ I'd rather deal with the depression than the side effects at this point. I've had very vivid nightmares of being gang raped_ beaten_ chased_etc. I'd wake up sweating_ screaming_ crying_ begging for my life. All I want is a normal nights sleep!

I have had 2 horrible cystic acne breakouts and have never had cystic acne in my life! I am slowly weaning off of this medicine.

I crave horrible foods (junk food_ fast food) that I know better than to eat but don't have the willpower to not eat them. I eat even when I'm not hungry! Stay feeling dizzy_ seeing strange things_ can't think clearly and having weird dreams. I've been on 40mg for about 3-4 weeks and I've decided to wean myself off this crap! I got a pill cutter and I'm going to do 20mg for 2 weeks then 20mg every other day for 2 more weeks and QUIT!,F,37,2  months40 1X D,6/22/2013Email,Viibryd
175, 5, Intermittant Explosive Disorder,Mild GI distress_ sort of like cramps_ decreased appetite_ which is great_ slight dizziness and slight blurred vision_ which I'm guessing will resolve with time. Also feels like my heart is racing after a few hours but it goes away after a few more hours.  BP and pulse are normal though.  I'll take these side effects over my IED ANYTIME!,So far this stuff is working great for me.  I have been dealing with IED for years now_ and tried Cymbalta for a couple of years_ but it seemed to lose it's effectiveness over time.  Got off the Cymbalta_ and even with slow tapering_ the withdrawal was pretty rough.  The IED returned so now I'm trying Viibryd.  I felt better the very first day on 10mg.  My Dr. gave me the trial pack to taper to 20mg and stay at that_ but I think I'm going to stay at 10mg since it's doing the job for me at that dosage. I can't remember the last time I was always happy!,M,50,4  days10mg 1X D,6/21/2013Email,Viibryd
176, 4, Depression_ Anxiety_ Panic Attacks,"Med worked GREAT to get me out of the ""black hole."" Unlike other SSRIs and SNRIs_ didn't have terrible head pain or nausea_ and it worked within a couple of days instead of weeks. Could begin to exercise and participate in activities. Made a huge mood difference. Unfortunately_ side effects of constipation_ insomnia_ acne and big increase in appetite made it uncomfortable. Dr. just changed me to Pristiq today to see if that works any better. If not_ because it helped so much with mood_ I'm willing to go back to Viibryd despite the side effects until I find another med. I was never able to tolerate higher than 10 mg because of worsening side effects. Like most people_ it's a difficult decision to decide whether it's better to be constipated_ fat and acne-covered_ or not be depressed.",,F,46,1  months10mg 1X D,6/20/2013,Viibryd

The pounding heart beat went away_ but I lost charisma and gained social awkwardness. I was getting very negative mental flashes_ including images of my own death_ yet before the med_ that never happened. I am not suicidal.

179, 4, Major depression - still taking med,- I had only a very slight queasyniess for the first three days. - The medicine kicked in the very first day for me. I felt so much better_ I refused to believe it until I had been on the meds longer.- Vivid dreams the first few days_ but nothing too crazy. The doctor also recommended melatonin before bedtime which I think helped ease the dreams.Cons:- Expensive!!! Even with insurance and a $30 coupon card_ these still cost me $100 per month.- Do NOT run out of your prescription. OMG. The dreams are for me what everyone else on here says. They are crazy_ paralyzing_ talk-in-your-sleep_ can't move dreams_ can't wake up from them. They SUCK. They are awful. I was out of money to pay for this med for about a week_ and they do not go away.- Manic. Could not stop talking. To myself_ to my kids_ to anyone.- Irritable- Pissed off AT THE WORLD- Crying spells return- Agitated- Just want to sleep (great_ more nightmares)- Dry itchy skin everywhere- Appetite loss,My doctor knew of all the side effects_ so she titrated me very slowly with the starter pack. Instead of 10_ 20_ 40_ we chose to cut the pills in half and do a 5_ 10_ 20 then 40 dosage.For me_ when I am on this med_ I feel great_ normal_ I have the ability to be happy. It works for me.When I am off/out of this EXPENSIVE med_ it really makes me angry that I have to take these in the first place. I understand why so many people switch meds or try to quit them altogether.Depression sucks. It runs in my family. I would not wish it on anyone.,F,44,7  months40 MG 1X D,5/15/2013Email,Viibryd

I was very dizzy and sick to my stomach within an hour of taking it with food.  I took it at lunch time and the rest of the day I felt terrible.  I also felt some heart racing and foggy vision.  When I woke up the next day_ I felt very off balance. I decided not to take this anymore after feeling so awful.  I hope I feel better soon.

182, 1, GAD,Stomach issues. I suffered stomach issues almost immediately but never made the connection until I started reading blogs.  Went to 2 different doctors who didn't make a connection either.  Was put on Prilosec for my stomach issues.,After I started researching my meds and stomach issues I made a connection.  One doctor suggested that if the Prilosec was working then everything should be fine. I don't understand what is fine about having to take another drug because of ones side effects. I quickly made the decision on my own to wean off the Viibryd. Oh boy it was rough! At 1st I tried too fast & ended up with panic attacks_ but the second try I did much slower_ probably took me 2 months or so to wean off completely.  I now take nothing for the GAD_ also no Prilosec & can honestly say I have never felt better!!!,F,36,1  years20 1X D,4/20/2013,Viibryd

I could not eat_ had no desire to drink water_ food had a strange taste to it and everything had the same strange smell. It also gave me very vivid and sad dreams. It took a good month before I began to feel somewhat returning to ""normal."" I still seem to have balance issues still. I believe this drug poisoned me.

185, 3, Major Depression,Initially started with 10mg for the first month along with 5mg of Ritalin.  I was suicidal and I immediately got relief after taking the pill.  It stopped all negative/depressive thinking although I was still depressed it just wasn't overwhelming.  Soft stools_ weight loss_ night sweats_ HAIR LOSS.  Also_ affected libido and caused anorgasmia.  After one month felt suicidal and doctor increased to 20 and instantly felt better and relief.  Have stayed on 20 for 6 months.  I have been trying to taper off at 15 but that made my mood down.  Quit cold turkey for 12 days and my mood and brain felt better_ quicker thinking and more alert.  However I had terrible joint pain.  It took 10 days to figure out the connection.  Now I'm not sure if I can ever get off it.  I'm taking 20 then 15 every other day but I still feel the joint pain.,It helped me a lot in a very rough patch.  However_ it seems the side effects of joint pain will not allow me to taper or stop.  That is a big issue.   Plus the  hair loss being so bad is upsetting.  I wish I could stop it.    I'm in a pickle.,F,48,8  months20 1X D,3/11/2013Email,Viibryd

188, 2, Depression_Panic Disorder_ Anxiety,I was taking Prozac for many years with very positive results but then unfortunately_ it stopped working for me and I started to feel depressed_ anxious_ having anxiety and panic attacks again so my dr. put me on Zoloft hoping it would work for me. It didn't so I was then put on Paxil. It also didn't work for me. Next was to try Viibryd. I was given the trial package to see if the medication would work for me first before my dr. went ahead and wrote me out a script for a three month's supply. I was happy about that because for the past few months_ I was paying for the Zoloft and then the Paxil which left me with spending money on meds for a three months supply on each medication only to have the meds not work for me and having to stop taking the med and wasting medication and my money. I started on 10mg of Viibryd and then went up to 20mg. I really haven't felt much better at all since I started taking Viibryd. The negative side effects that I've experienced since beginning Viibryd are,"It's been very difficult to control my urges to eat more_ especially sweets. I feel hungry ALL THE TIME. Also_ I've been having night sweats-it's horrible. I wake up soaked in sweat. I have also been crying alot for no real reason and I'm very emotional and ""moody"". The ONLY positive thing I have experienced with taking Viibryd is I haven't been as tired as I usually feel and I've been able to function on less sleep. So I have experienced an increase in energy somewhat. I am currently back down to taking 10mg 1x per day and I've decided that Viibryd is definitely not for me and I'm going to see what my dr. suggests next. It's been very frustrating for me to be switched from medication to medication_ but I went through 3 medications prior to finding relief with Prozac so I know there has to be hope in another anti-anxiety_ panic_ and depression medication that will help me.

It worked well for my depression without that ""medicated feeling""  and it had no side effects. Usually APs make me feel lethargic and/or wired and I look pale and sickly. Viibryd made me feel just normal and motivated with the relief of non-existent depression. I would've given this a 5 but it turned down to a 1 when my anxiety was growing highly intense towards the end. So I give it a 3.

Dropped back down to 20 mg and felt much better.  This medication worked VERY well for me.  Side effects were:  I have gained 20 lbs over the year and got a few headaches.  I did find that taking the medication at the same time every day was very important.  I did so well in the last year on this medication that I am now weaning off it.  I reduced the mg to 10_ then 5 for 2 weeks.  Today is my second day without it and I feel great.

I've tried just about everything over a 13 span: Welbutrin_ Effexor_ Zoloft_ Lexapro_ and others like it.  Even some stronger options such as Lithium and Nuvigil.  Nothing worked to any noticeable level and the side effects were as much an issue as the depression and anxiety in many instances.I've been on Viibryd for nearly two months and am amazed.  The depression that always seems to be following me (like the Abilify commercials) has disappeared.  I saw a substantial improvement after just 3 three days_ and it has been mostly positive ever since.  It does not leave me with a ""caffeinated"" feeling or render a ""drug induced false happiness"".  Things just seem more NORMAL.  What a great feeling to actually feel like getting out of bed_ going to work_ taking a walk_ going to the mall with my family_ or whatever.

In that regard the drug was a miracle.Now that I have been on it for 3 months_ although I no longer think of it as the perfect med_ I don't want the thoughts to come back so I am staying on it.I tried increasing the dose from 20mg to 30mg and the gassiness and queasiness was just too much to bare.  Decided to supplement with 20mg of prozac.  So currently I am taking 20mg Viibryd and 20mg prozac and I feel relatively normal mentally.Most of the side effects were gone at the 1 month mark.

According to most of the reviews I have read about Viibryd (and I have read a lot)_ most people are experiencing RAPID weight gain and food cravings. I went off of Viibryd_ one week ago_ because of its horrible side effects on me_ and I have already lost 4 pounds. My mind is A LOT better too. I have only read of a couple of instances where people have actually lost weight. If you are hoping to lose weight from this drug_ I think the odds are against you. I think that initially_ when people start taking Viibryd_ they feel better. After you have been on it for a while and your MG's titrate from 20-40_ the side effects that Viibryd have on you are very scary_ to say the least!,,F,47,7  months40,11/23/2012,Viibryd

221, 1, Depression_ anxiety,Increased depression and anxiety. 30 pound weight gain. Irritation_ horrible craving for sweets. Very tired and unmotivated.,Viibryd is the worst antidepressant that has EVER been put out on the market!!! I stopped taking it TODAY. It  makes me MORE depressed_ anxious and aggitated. I am ALWAYS tired and run-down. I can't get my work done at my job_ because I don't have the desire or motivation. I sleep all of the time! I never want to do anything or go anywhere_ because it takes too much energy to get ready. Viibryd has also caused some damage in my relationships with my family. I have become very short-tempered_ aggressive and impatient with my kids and husband. It is not my nature to be so aggressive and angry. I use to exercise everyday_ but I no longer do it_ because it takes too much energy to get out of bed. I have joined a gym to MAKE myself get out and exercise. I use to exercise five times per week. I had high hopes that this medicine would help my depression and anxiety. However_ it made it worse. I did not expect that!!! I'd rather be on NOTHING at all than on Viibryd.I hope_ that by reading my experience on Viibryd_ I have helped someone.,F,47,7  months40 MG 1X D,11/21/2012Email,Viibryd

It's just not the right med for me.  I'm also hopeing that the side effects I have from the drug will go away completely.  i've tried what seems like everything.. from the newest pill on the market to ECT and nothing is working.,F,44,2  months20 MG 1X D,11/19/2012Email,Viibryd

225, 2, depression,If you like having diarrhea_ then this is the drug for you. Also very bad joint pain (knees & elbows) starting around the 4th week. Jaw clenching_ difficulty staying focused.  Constant stomach churning at night. Constant yawning. Frequent urination.,Started with the 2 week pack. 10mg first week then 20mg second week. Never went higher than the 20mg as I was already having issues and was concerned about increasing the dosage. Got tired of trips to the bathroom so I have been off the drug now for 12 days. Lots of lingering side effects still. Dizzy off and on during the day. No sudden trip to the barhroom though. Frequent yawning has slowed down some but still there telling me that some of the drug is still floating around in me. Waas on Lexapro for 4+ years but that stopped working and it to had side effects but never as bad as Viibryd.,M,60,6  weeks20 1X D,11/10/2012,Viibryd

230, 3, Anxiety_ depression_ OCD,I've taken a wide assortment of antidepressants (both SSRIs and SNRIs)_ and the one that helped the most was Lexapro.  Unfortunately_ it stopped working.  I was recently put on Viibryd by my psych_ and I've had relatively few side effects so far.  No digestive problems whatsoever.  I have become much more emotional_ though--like reliving past tragedies in my head and sobbing about them for a few hours.  It's almost like reliving the grief cycle.  Also_ Viibryd has made me prone to bouts of aggression.  Some days I think about punching some of my annoying co-workers (ha_ ha)_ but I've managed to control my anger thus far.  I've also had some really bizarre dreams and night sweats.  Fun times all around.  As for anxiety_ it's only somewhat effective.

Tentatively started Viibryd hoping I wouldn't have to suffer from a week of diarrhea.  So happy that didn't happen to me.The drug has made me VERY talkative.  More aggressive and less shy.  I am on top of the world.  I know this feeling won't last_ but for now I'm loving it.  Trying to get as much work done as possible while I have this epic motivation.Was taking Buspar for bruxism and now with Viibryd (dumb name) the bruxism is almost completely gone.  I'm stoked!At least give it a try for a month.  My P-doc says only 25% of his patients get the diarrhea.

234, 2, Depression,Dry mouth_ craving sweets_ nightmares_ insomnia_ terrible nausea_ blurry vision and strange taste.,I think the antidepressant benefits are there with Viibryd.  Every patient tolerates meds in a different way.  However_ the side effects were much worse than the antidepressant benefit.  I noticed the antidepressant benefits after week one.  Also_ my libido went through the roof!  I stopped taking it after two days of the 40 mg dose.  Withdrawal caused SEVERE nightmares for two nights in a row.  I literally woke up screaming one of those nights!  In my case_ benefits did not outweigh side effects but it might be perfect for someone else.  If your doctor prescribes it_ I wouldn't recommend going longer than two weeks if you can't tolerate the side effects.,M,40,21  days20 MG 1X D,9/8/2012,Viibryd
235, 1, Depression and Anxiety,I started taking Viibryd two months ago.  I started at 10m_ then moved to 20mg_ then to 40mg.  There were no side effects the first two weeks.  The third week_ the brain zaps started.  They were HORRIBLE and terrifying!!!  I had no idea what was going on with me until I got online and found that there are a lot of people that get them with this type of medicine.  I also read that they would taper off_ so I decided to ride it out.  The only problem now was insomnia.  My moods and response to irritating situations were so much better!  I was able to handle situations with a calm_ clear head.  All in all_ I was a lot happier and my marriage improved drastically.  A month and a half in_ I started feeling my moods getting worse_ I had a decent amount of headaches_ diahrreaha daily and the insomnia turned into me wanting to sleep ALL the time.

I was prescribed Viibryd after some life changing situations that left me severely depressed & I had one severe panic attack that landed me in the ER. I started taking the Viibryd & I was having multiple severe panic attacks a day_ I was incredibly dizzy & had absolutely no appetite. The side effects were effecting my work. Against my doctors & families reccomendations I stopped taking it a after day 7. Took a day or two but the severe (almost constant) panic attacks_ anxiety & dizziness stopped. I'm still having my regular anxiety & depression but I'm working with doctor to find a new medication.Being on Viibryd was scary. I had feelings & fear I've never felt before.

238, 5, severe depression & anxiety,At first a little diarrhea_ dry mouth.  Nothing terrible or unbearable.,This medicine has worked WONDERS for me.  I literally felt better the first day that I took it!  It has gotten rid of my anxiety (tight chest_ panicky feelings_ rapid heartbeat_ etc.) & has helped me cope with my depression.  Before this med I was crying all the time_ could not function.  After this med I feel more like my old self again.  I can focus & think clearly_ and I actually feel happy more of the time.  I can see the good in all situations.  If I am late taking a dose_ I do feel its absence_ because the anxiety comes back as does the depression.  I'd recommend taking it in the morning with some type of protein.  I'm SO glad my dr. put me on this!!!,F,31,1  months10-20-40 1X D,8/31/2012Email,Viibryd

240, 2, Anxiety_Depression,Terrible nightmares_ insomnia_ diarrhea_ aching jaws_ headaches_ fatigue_ uncontrollable crying at times_ and become combative when I don't take the med ON TIME.,I switched to Viibryd_ after taking Lexapro for about 6 years.  On the Lexapro_ I had frequent brain zaps and sexual disfunction_ which disappeared entirely once I started taking Viibryd.  Initially_ I felt as though I was able to make better decisions and thought this drug was going to really work for me.  I felt the diarrhea would probably ease up over time_ along with the insomnia.  Wellll... after taking it now for 4 months_ I'm not quite so sure that trading the side effects of the Lexapro was worth the mess I'm now going through with the Viibryd.  Some of the nightmares I'm having are truly terrible and I've recently started waking myself up crying out_ - something I've never done before in my life.  In the morning_ I'm exhausted... my jaws ache_ my head hurts to where I'm taking Advil every morning now_ my muscles ache to the point that I have a hard time walking_ and can literally cry on a dime.  I just don't feel good anymore at all_ and definitely not like myself emotionally.   I take my med in the morning_ and if I am a few hours late taking it or get busy on a weekend and forget?  I'm mad at the world for no good reason and get VERY depressed_ I just sit there and cry and cry... it's awful.  ~  Please think twice before taking this med!

241, 2, Angry/overwhelmed/tired,Jittery_ Nightmares_ Dizziness_ Manic Feeling,Because I did not feel like getting up to go to work anymore_ I began the 10-20-40 dosage in May after being on Prozac for several years for feeling like I was yelling at my children/husband all the time. I have been taking the 40 mg dose every morning for about a month.  Everything was great for a while (except for an instance during the first week of the increased dose in which I irrationally screamed at my child)_ but in the last week or so_ I have become very jittery and dizzy in the mornings; I feel like the whole bed is shaking when my husband barely moves; I've become very irritable and a little spastic at work.  Last night I had a very vivid nightmare that a flying monster was firing at me with an automatic weapon. I itch all over now and frequently feel like I might be having delusions.I've never felt this way before and feel like there must be some connection to the build up of this medication in my body.  The doctor has decreased me to 40 mg every other day for the next week...however_ this morning_ I switched back to my 20 mg of Prozac (because of the nightmare) and am having to take Dramamine for the dizziness...I can tell that this medication has significantly affected by brain actions/reactions and that has really scared me.,F,42,65  days40MG 1X D,8/18/2012,Viibryd

I now have nightmares that I wake up screaming and not knowing what's real and it's never happened before. And the stomach issues got worse.

I've also had moderate stomach issues thus far.  My desire for sweets and junk food has gone through the roof which i have found hard to control. Seems odd since ""reduced side effects"" is how this drug is being marketed. I have never had so many side effects from an AD in my life!  Despite these issues_ I'm going to try to at least finish the sample pack with the hope that these issues will subside.  I haven't noticed much change in my depression or anxiety thus far..

I also suffer from a slight dissociative disorder_ related to PTSD_ and most AD I've tried help with the mood_ for a while_ but the side effects have always exacerbated the dissociative stuff_ and the anti-depressant effect ultimitley wears off_ leaving me feeling detqched andlike a machine. For me the experience with Viibryd has been entirely different and tremendously better. The initial side effects can be a little harsh (namely the diarrhea)_ but ultimitley I feel much better particularly with he dissociative stuff. To put it simply I haven't able to cry in years and with this I can cry at all the moment a person should cry_ namely human moments. So I feel much more human and that my dissociative symptoms have alleviated_ which for the latter is significant_ as no other medication has been able to do this. A lot of the reports for this are very negative or very positive_ which leads me to wonder whether descriptions by the former are drug company propaganda please give this a try and try to withstand the seemingly harsh initial physical side-effects; they went away for me.

At the beginning of week four I started having occasional muscle twitching or the ""jumping"" feeling as I was falling asleep. By the end of week 4 the twitching/ ""jumping"" was continual throughout the night.","I was taking Viibryd in combination with Wellbutrin. I purposely did not read All the side effects of the Viibryd to try to avoid the power of suggestion. (dumb_ now I know) I was very happy with initial results of the Viibryd. I was actually feeling happy_ laughing_ enjoying my kids more & wanting to participate in activities. While on vacation (beginning the 4th week on Viibryd @ 20mg) I started with the occasional twitching_ but just thought it was because I was overtired_ not in my own house/bed etc. By the end of that week (now back home) I started having the twitching almost all night...alternating between my hand_ arms_ legs_ foot_ cheek/lip_ buttocks_ and whole body. To the point that I was afraid to fall asleep. Obviously after that night I ck'd on the side effects more closely and then called the dr. She's now weaning my off Viibryd and wants to start Celexa. The twitching stopped when I went back to 10mg...almost considering trying to stay @ 10mg of Viibryd to see if I can still get same ""happy"" results.

I apparently was having withdrawals from celexa.  Doc put me back on celexa 20mg and cut viibryn down to 20mg.  I have different phrases throught the day.  Most positive is the fact I have feelings.  Laughing more (feel like my sense of humor is back).  However_ I go through spurts throughout the day of being droggy.  In the evening_ I feel like I am deliriously tired and little weird like I cant get my thoughts together.  Having emotional feelings again is good_ but sad at the same time.  Because now I feel I am finally grieving over the loss of my baby boy.  I was going to reduce the viibryn to 10mgs hoping that it would help so I can think more clear.  Sometimes I feel like a dummy especially at work because I am a supervisor and have 10 staff members to tend to daily.  But I am hearing that alot of the side effects lesson as treatment goes on.  I do have a difficult time when my children start whining_ its almost like someone scratching their nails on a chalk board.  I get annoyed which every parent does but I also get agitated in an instant; which shouldn't happen instantly.  I am willing to give the med some more time.

I ended up at my doctors office on Monday and they couldn't do anything. I asked if these were side effect from this medicine and they said no way. Tuesday_ I ended up in ER with same symptoms. Dr there said it had to do with this medicine. He gave me Xanax to take the edge off of those side effects which has helped. I went back to my Dr's office and they are weaning me off.  I definitely would not recommend this medicine.  It is too new and not a lot of research has been done it. Research it before taking_ I wish I looked into it more before starting.  The other thing is_ I was supposed to be on something short term (thyroid issues which causes anxiety and that is being looked into) but come to find out this is a long term drug.  I can't wait to get off of this crap!!!!,,F,36,7  days10mg,3/15/2012Email,Viibryd

It does cause me to eat more but for some reason I have lost weight on it_ which I don't want.  I take it with adderall xr and lamictal.  It does seem to lessen the adderall a little bit_ but I think it's a good thing.  I feel more ""balanced"" all around.",,F,25,2  weeks20 mg,2/20/2012,Viibryd
267, 3, Depression,Sexual side effects. Extreme difficulty in ejaculation and erections. Heavy fatigue in early mornings. Gas and constipation.,I was on Lexapro from 2008 to end of 2011 due to depression brought on by the finanical crisis. On Lexapro my sexual functions became minimal (no erections except with Viagra and very hard to ejaculate. Pain immediately after  ejaculation in the area of the prostrate became marked. I switched to Viibryd and noted the following: Much improved depression. As bad or worse identical sexulal side effects as to Lexapro.,M,58,120  days40 MG 1X D,2/18/2012Email,Viibryd
268, 3, Depression and anxiety,Crippling Diarrhea_ increase in anxiety and moodiness_ increase in thoughts that don't normally occur to me_ increase in ocd symptoms.,"I started this med with the 10-20-40mg titration pack. Seemed like a sleeper_ ie_ it started slowly and I thought I was getting away easy because I didn't have the diarrhea to start with. Once I was on the 40 for awhile the diarrhea became untenable. Minimum of 5/day up to every hour_ kidney pain_ dehydration_ etc. Immodium made me sicker_ pepto seemed to help until it made my stomach burn. When I was on the 20mg_ I felt like this might be a good drug for me_ felt more in control of appetite and more clear thinking. 40mg also brought on OCD-like behaviors I've only rarely struggled with_ and more anxiety and unreasonably ""mean"" feelings towards others_ like thinking of ditching friendships because of irritation with the person. I think 20 mg alone or with another med might work_ will talk to doc. Been on antidepressants since 1994-ish. Was pretty consistent on Prozac except for having to stop and start it again when it stopped working. Have occasionally had to switch if depression flared up. The last five years have brought worsening issues and development of major drug sensitivities_ possibly due to health issues and/or menopausal issues. We'll see where this goes_ but I cannot tolerate the diarrhea anymore. Probiotics and electrolytes didn't help_ and I'm a big believer in probio's. I gave this a 3 because the lower dose kind of helped_ I'd like to see how it feels longer term on 20.",F,47,3.5  months40 1X D,2/10/2012Email,Viibryd
269, 3, Irritability,Sexual dysfunction_ food cravings/weight gain,I'm especially sensitive to SSRIs and SNRIs. They work amazingly for me but the sexual side effects are severe. I've tried almost everything out there and was psyched to hear about Viibryd being less likely to cause sexaul sid effects. Not true_ at least for me anyway. Within a week my libido vanished. I gave it two months but honestly I don't think the positive effects of Viibryd were anything as good as Lexapro_ for example. My psychiatrist thinks I might fair better with an extremely low dose of Prozac_ like 5mg/day. We'll see....,M,36,2  months20 1X D,1/12/2012,Viibryd

271, 5, Depression. Anxiety,Increase in appetite.Some insomnia.,I was taking Lexapro and Lamictal. My Dr. changed the Lexapro to Viibryd. Noticeable positive differences. More positive attitude_ increased sense of humor_ anxiety seems easier to control. Most importantly to me has been the elimination of the negative sexual side effects I had with the Lexapro and the dozens of other medications I have been on.,M,58,11  weeks40mg 1X D,12/28/2011,Viibryd
272, 2, Anxiety and Depression,No side effects at all.  Maybe a slight increase in appetite.  No real weight gain though.,I decided to give one more SSRI/SNRI a chance for treating my lifelong anxiety disorder.  I have pretty much given them all a go--Paxil_ Prozac_ Zoloft_ Luvox_ Remeron_ Serzone_ Effexor_ Celexa_ Lexapro_ Celexa_ Wellbutrin.  I heard a year of success in the late 1990s_ but since then_ it's been pretty crappy.  Viibryd has done very little to stop my chronic anxiety_ panic_ and depression.  It just feels weak to me.  I am getting little relief.  I am going to try a TCA_ such as nortriptolene_ next.  If that doesn't work_ it's on to the MAOIs.,M,44,5  months80mg 1X D,12/28/2011,Viibryd
273, 5, Severe depression_ moderate anxiety,Insomnia_ but not as severe as with most SSRIs.  I alternate taking 1 mg. serotonin_ 1000 - 2000 mg. tryptophan (start low)_ 2 cups herbal tea_ or 1 generic Ambien_ and have not become sleep-deprived.Initial diarrhea treated with probiotics has gone away.Does have sexual side effects for me_ alas.Does increase fatigue_ appetite (a little)  and especially spaciness_ but who cares_ if you're happy?,Have tried every depression_ anxiety_ mood-equalizer out there over the course of the years.  Couldn't tolerate any_ usually because of insomnia_ sometimes because was knocked out_ drugged up.  Lexapro I could tolerate_ but it didn't work and actually increased my anxiety sometimes.  This was pretty much my last chance_ and I can't believe I'm saved!  It's a new drug.  No one knows what the long term effects will be on general health_ but they have to be less than suicide would have been!  So I will and can (yea!) stay on Viibryd.,F,63,5  months40 mg. 1X D,11/27/2011Email,Viibryd
274, 2, depression,constipation_ diarrhea_ sexual,My review is not completely fair since I did not give Viibryd a full trial. I knocked it off because it just wasn't having any positive effect on my mood. And yes_ there was some sexual dysfunction_ although less than the other SSRIs I have tried.,M,40,3  weeks20 1X D,11/26/2011,Viibryd

276, 3, anxiety/depressed(cig cessation),insomnia (went away on 5th night)_ diarrhea (started 6th morning),"This medicine works well.  If the diarrhea goes away_ then I will keep taking this.  I take probiotics every day and still had diarrhea this morning.  This is the first time_ though (day 6).I have a lot less anxiety in general.  It seems as if I have more control over my thoughts and emotions.  This drug doesn't make you ""numb"".  It just makes you in control.  That is what most depressed/anxious people WANT_ right?  It sure is nice to be the calm and collected one when everything is going to hell.  You can't think straight when you're worked up.Anyways_ this is a great drug.  I advise staying on the lowest dose that you can.  This will keep you from having so many side-effects.  I really can't even imagine taking 40mg of this.  I weigh 150 pounds....the thought of 40mg just scares me.  Good luck.",M,29,6  days10mg 1X D,11/12/2011Email,Viibryd

278, 4, Depression,Diarrhea_ Mild Headache,Third week on Viibryd--been on 40 mg for five days. I was on Lexapro but it seemed to poop out or my post-partum depression was too much for the max dose. Definitely did not like the diarrhea side effect as I have major stomach problems_ but it does go away. I feel pretty good. Before the Viibryd I was experiencing weepiness and major panic attacks. Feel much less depressed and anxious. It seems to be working. Sleeping better too. I've been on antidepressants for 20 years (zoloft_ celexa_ effexor_ lexapro). Hope this one keeps doing what it's doing.,F,42,3  weeks40 MG 1X D,10/30/2011Email,Viibryd
279, 4, anxiety,Strong drowsiness_ jittery_ dizziness_ spacey,My psychiatrist switched me to this from Lexapro 20mg because I complained of sexual side effects and weight gain.  Viibryd totally reversed the sexual side effects so far_ shocked.  Weight gain_ not sure about_ certainly not losing weight.  The weight issue is a big deal for me since its making me sad to look fatter_ so I hope it helps.  The sexual side effects disappearing have made me optimistic that this drug will be better for me than Lexapro.  I hope it is as affective as Lexapro was in dealing with my General Anxiety Disorder.  I do feel more anxious so far but nothing like I was without drugs.,M,39,19  days40 1X D,10/15/2011,Viibryd

After that_ increases have produced minimal side effects that dissipate quickly.,while it is still too soon to give a comprehensive rating_ so far this drug has helped enormously.  I came off Prozac_ which seemed to have ceased working.  Viibryd helped with depression immediately and more recently with insomnia and anxiety.  Big plus: no sexual side effects as I had on Prozac.,F,42,12  days20mg 1X D,9/3/2011,Viibryd
282, 4, Depression,Minor GI issuesDizziness,I agree that the idiot(s) who are adding 1 ratings on pure speculation should be ashamed!I'm hyper-sensitive to most psych drugs and haven't been able to stay on them for long_ the couple I could tolerate caused me to gain 40-50 pounds in a matter of months which I couldn't deal with either.  I started taking Adderall a few months ago just so I could function which helped a lot.I started with 10mgs of Viibryd for a week then 20 for 2 weeks and jumped up to 40 a week ago.  Each time I felt nauseous with some other minor GI symptoms for a few days which quickly subsided but not completely.  I take it in the morning and feel dizzy until the afternoon.  This decreases after a few days as well but not as much and is the only side affect I'm concerned about since it affects me at work.Personally I don't feel sedated or manic at all on Viibryd.  Other than the dizziness I do feel more positive and have started to want to get off my couch and actually do things which is huge for me.  An unexpected benefit that others have mentioned is that my anxiety has decreased as well.As far as sexual side affects goes I haven't really noticed any like I have with other drugs.,M,42,4  weeks40 1X D,8/17/2011,Viibryd
283, 5, Depression,"Reviewer who wrote in twice with a rating of ""1"" even though you don't take the drug: how do we know you're not a drug rep for a company that makes a competing drug? What do you think you're gaining by acting like a freaking idiot and posting stupid crap like that on here?

285, 3, Panic disorder,sexual dysfunction - better than when I was on Paxil but no better than lexapro.,I have previously taken Paxil and lexapro.  Viibryd is as effective_ perhaps a bit more effective_ than these in controlling my panic disorder.  However_ i have experienced insomnia and anxiety (heart pounding_ jittery etc) on Viibryd that I did not have with the oher meds.  Additionally_ the sexuL side effects are still there_ about as they ate withe lexapro.  Not the right med for me; I will go back to lexapro.,F,49,30  days20 1X D,8/7/2011,Viibryd
286, 4, Clinical Depression,A little nausea_ dry mouth_ a little sedation,"Two ""1"" reviews from patients who don't take the drug? Those are the reviews to be wary of. I've switched from Prozac (on it for 2 years) to Viibryd. It's always a little tough with any med change. Viibryd feels ""cleaner"" to me than any of the SSRI's_ SNRI's I've tried in the past. The bad? Minor nausea_ dry mouth and minor sedation (renders the Adderall I take almost useless). The good was noticed by my wife before it was noticed by me. This med seems to allow me more time to process things before frustration sets in. I'm less quick to anger and don't feel as agitated as I did. Hopefully the nausea and sedation will go away. According to my pdoc_ this is a SSRI_ but has a 5HTA agonist (no idea what it means_ but helps with anxiety). This drug helps me more than others I've taken thus far. I'll post an update in a couple weeks.",M,38,2  weeks20 MG 1X D,7/31/2011,Viibryd
287, 1, Depression,,"Since this is an anonymous forum_ I think we all need to be wary of glowing reviews with no mention of side effects--and in particular_ a promise of zero sexual side effects.

288, 4, Anxiety_ Depression,Definitely a morning drug.  While not Stimulating_ taking it at night caused insomnia.  Worked my way up to the recomended dose of 40mg and each time there is a transient increase of anxiety that takes a day or two to diminish.,Was on paxil for many years and it worked wonders_ but the sexual side effects were too much.  In otherwords I didn't know what I was capable of until I quit that drug.  As time goes on with Viibryd_ I feel less emotionally liable_ which was a problem with me anytime I wasn't on an SSRI.  I can say_ the sexual side effects so far are much less harsh than any SSRI I have taken_ but we will wait to see what 40mg does.  Pretty easy to start too.  I guess that's why you titrate up.  I will give it a couple more weeks and the report back but so far_ it has been the easiest SSRI to start.  Not quite Paxil yet_ but we will see in a couple weeks.,M,34,3  weeks40mg 1X D,7/20/2011Email,Viibryd
289, 5, Depression,None so far,While it may be too early to tell_ I switched from Lexapro to Viibryd and I feel like I'm doing a lot better. I have less anxiety and I can tell my sexual dysfunction is starting to go away.,M,27,2  weeks40 MG 1X D,6/23/2011Email,Viibryd
