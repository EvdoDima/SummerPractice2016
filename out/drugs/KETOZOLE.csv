0, 5, For toenail fungus,It turned my toenail orange. Other than that no other side effects.,I have applied this product to my large right toe twice a day for 6 months for  a bad toe nail fungus. It is like nail polish and was compounded by our Pharmacy. There is only a tiny bit of fungus left on the very tip of the nail. The next time I cut my nails it will be gone.  The Pharmacist said it would take about 6 months to clear up.,F,73,6  months2% 2X D,2/21/2015,Ketozole
