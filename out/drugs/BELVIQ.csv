2, 2, weight loss,I did not experience any side effects,The medication did nothing to change my appetite or my energy level.  In short_ it did not work,M,42,30  days 2X D,1/15/2015,Belviq
3, 5, Weight loss,The first 4 days were horrible -- headache_ fatigue and VERY dizzy. I was taking 2Xper day as prescribed but I cut back to once per day and the side effects vanished.,"In this short time (1 week) I've lost about 5 pounds. (I lost 5 lbs. per MONTH on Weight Watchers) It's not that my appetite has completely disappeared; it hasn't_ but it restrains it enough so that I'm not always looking for high carbohydrate snacks. It also seems to squash any desire for alcoholic beverages. I have always worked out at least 1 hour per day so that helps too I'm sure. So in short_ it's not a ""miracle pill"" -- you still have to eat right & exercise but it gives you that edge to resist high calorie foods. And so far_ it seems to be very effective.",F,62,1  weeks10 MG 1X D,7/27/2014,Belviq
