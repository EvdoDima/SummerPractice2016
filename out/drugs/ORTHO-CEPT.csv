4, 1, birth control/acne,Cystic Acne,I was on yasmin which gave me clear skin_ but switched because I was concerned about it having a higher blood clot risk. Ortho-cept gave me massive cystic acne . I thought it was an initial breakout but every month it kept getting worse. I tried it for just over 3 months. As soon as I stopped it my skin started getting better on it`s own. It`s been a month I stopped and I am not breakout anymore but am left with scars from my time on ortho-cept. Everyone is different on the pill_ but ortho-cept was not for me !,F,24,3  months 1X D,1/20/2014,Ortho-cept

6, 5, Birth Control,I recently switched onto Ortho-Cept from Loestrin 24 Fe.  Since the switch_ I've felt great and have lost 5 pounds.  The weight loss seems to be an unintended side effect since I wasn't trying to lose weight.  My doctor warned me that there is a slightly increased risk of blood clots on Ortho-Cept_ but I take a baby aspirin every other day (I'm 40 years-old) and am not particularly worried.,,F,40,30  days33 mg 1X D,9/23/2013Email,Ortho-cept

I am uncomfortable more then I used to be during my periods and well I am considering going off the pill all together.,,F,19,1  years,5/8/2013,Ortho-cept
9, 2, Prevent pregnancy,I just recently started taking this pill and I am not satisfied at all! I have never had acne but since I've been on this pill_ I have had quite the break out. Noticed a bit increase in my breast size but not worth the acne and soreness in my breasts.  Used to be on reclipsen and I will be switching back in no time!,,F,20,1  months,5/2/2013,Ortho-cept
10, 4, birth control,breast growth and tenderness_ spotting between periods_ shorter periods_ low sex drive,So far I have been very pleased with ortho-cept. I've had some spotting but that's normal when you first start taking the pill. I haven't had mood swings or an increase in appetite_ but I have recently lost all interest in having sex,F,23,5  weeks 1X D,2/19/2013,Ortho-cept
11, 3, Heavy period/birth control,Larger breasts_ lighter and shorter periods_ but more acne! I know I have only been taking it for 3 months but my skin has gotten progressively worse. I only would have a few breakouts every month or so but now I break out more frequently and its all over my face. It may be mild acne but I am considering stopping my prescription.,,F,15,3  months 1X D,2/15/2013,Ortho-cept
12, 4, Pregnancy prevention,Increase in appetite but nothing I couldnt control. Increase in breat tenderness and increase in size_ thats always a plus. Main side effect is my break outs.

19, 2, Ortho-Cept high in Estrogen,Uncontrollable acne_ mood swings_ breast tenderness and increase in appetite!,I know I have only been on this for a month but I don't know if being on it is worth it anymore. I was struggling with mild acne so I went to planned parenthood to get something that would help with it. Well_ the doctor gave me Ortho-Cept that is high in Estrogen to help me mostly with acne. I have about had it with my acne and it's only been a month. It's painful and it's on my neck which has never happened. My breasts are tender. The slightest touch hurts. I get some mood swings_ not to bad so fat_ & I could eat a cow! If after bout 5 months_ and my acne doesn't clear up_ I'm changing!,F,16,1  months0.15MG 1X D,8/13/2012Email,Ortho-cept
20, 2, Prevent Pregnancy,Severe depression_ mood swings_ fatigue_ weight gain_ nausea_ headaches_ etc.This pill made my acid reflux worse.I was on the verge of tears all day every day for no reason_ and had erratic moods.I got so bloated at one point that I was actually scared to death that I was pregnant.I'm petite at 5'2 at 110 pounds_ and I gained 10. AND I'M A VEGETARIAN!I started getting frequent and severe headaches.I was so tired with absolutely no energy_ and could fall asleep at any moment during the day. I felt narcoleptic..I already have bad acne_ and it became impossible to control since taking this.,I'm sure there's more side effects I experienced that I'm failing to mention here_ or ones I could elaborate on_ but all I know is_ is that I'm not gonna try experimenting with other birth control pills. I feel weird messing with my body's natural hormones. I know most women and doctors would recommend trying other pills to find one that works for me_ but I'm just not comfortable putting my body through that type of stress again. So as of today I officially quit taking this pill_ and am researching non-hormonal contraceptive methods_ including the diaphragm and cervical cap. I know the pill is most effective in preventing pregnancy_ but for some of us at a high cost. The only pros for me was no babies_ and regular periods. Well and my boyfriend kept telling me my boobs were getting bigger_ which I didn't notice much_ but he's a guy haha..This pill may or may not be for you. Try at your own risk_ (as with any birth control pill)_ and I wish you luck!,F,19,8  months 1X D,7/20/2012Email,Ortho-cept
21, 4, Irregular periods,Weight gain_ breast enlargement_ & mood swings. I would say it has helped a bit with clearing up my skin as well. I had to look up side effects for this BC to see if anyone else had a weight gain_ so I know I'm not going crazy. But this isn't good for me_ someone who was a sufferer of an eating disorder_ to have such a weight gain. I do have to say_ however_ that it has helped my irregular periods. I just don't know if I should continue.,,F,29,10  months1X,7/3/2012Email,Ortho-cept
22, 5, Contraception,Clear skin_ increased appetite,I haven't had any bad side effect while on this pill. No acne_ although I normally have very clear skin so no big difference there. Sex drive is not affected at all and no nausea.,F,18,3  months 1X D,5/8/2012,Ortho-cept
23, 2, no babies,Loss of sex drive_ headaches_ tiredness_ cramping_ spotting_ breakthrough bleeding,I've been taking Ortho-Cept for about three months. The 1st & 2nd month were fine & I didn't notice any side effects besides my boobs getting a little bigger & perhaps a slight loss in my sex drive. This 3rd month has been hellish_ however. I spotted for about a week before my period started & I'm still bleeding (all day & pretty constantly) almost two weeks after it should have ended. Being on my period pretty much for a full month has led to my other side effects - I'm cramping up_ I'm tired_ & I have bad headaches. This was just my experience_ but I wouldn't recommend this pill.,F,17,3  months 1X D,5/3/2012Email,Ortho-cept
24, 4, Prevent pregnancy,Breast enlargement_ some weight gain_ mild acne,I didn't see any clearing up of my acne from this BC_ which was disappointing considering my old prescription from Planned Parenthood cleared up my acne really well_ but they changed their brands. However_ my boobs are now a 36 D (up a cup size) and it works for preventing pregnancy. I haven't had long periods either_ but I still get some cramps. Overall_ I'm pretty damn satisfied with this product_ and haven't had any problems with it.,F,16,2  months 1X D,4/26/2012,Ortho-cept
25, 3, irregular periods,headaches_ insomnia.,It's only been two weeks_ so I am trying to give it a little longer for my body to get used to it. I have noticed more frequent headaches_ but I get headaches while not on birth control_ again I am waiting it out to see if my body gets used to it. I feel for those on who review it who are having a hard time. It's been a few years since I've used the pill_ so I think its ok to wait it out a little or try something else. Best of luck. Excedrin Migraine helps with headaches and I find lowering caffeine has helped. Good luck_ if not there are other choices out there and something may be a better fit.,F,33,14  days 1X D,4/26/2012Email,Ortho-cept
26, 2, no babies,break out_ spotting_ increased sensitivity to smell,I figured tonight after spotting 5 days after finishing a period I had (because I missed one pill) I would look up others experience with this. I've also felt less strong since I started taking this pill which I thought might just be me_ but I stopped feeling as strong (not able to do as many push ups and pull ups as before) about a week after starting this pill. I'm not stoked on it at all. I took my last pill last night and I'm going back to Planned Parenthood to change it up.The last pill I was on_ microgestin_ was awesome but I didn't like not having periods. I know some people want to get rid of theirs but I was just scared I wouldn't know if I happened to get pregnant.,F,26,  1X D,4/21/2012Email,Ortho-cept

28, 4, Acne and Pregnancy prevention,Increased appetite for sure and possibly insomnia. I phrase it this way because I have had trouble sleeping before I started taking this_ so I do not know if this is just a correlation or a side effect.,"For all the people commenting about having horrible side effects from Ortho-Cept: Number 1- it says in the directions that side effects could last for the first three months and most physicians advise staying on the pill for at least 2 months for your body to get used to the new hormones. Number 2- it is not that Ortho-cept ""sucks"" but rather everybody's bodies have different hormone levels and some birth controls just work for some people and others don't. Number 3- this is a high hormone dose birth control so if you are having ""extreme"" side effects you should probably be on lower dose birth control.Number 4- this birth control is used to prevent acne and as with people who don't have A.D.D. taking Adderall_ the effects are the opposite. For the people who did not have acne prior and then got it after taking this_ that is most likely the reason.",F,20,6  days15 MG 1X D,2/20/2012Email,Ortho-cept

I have now changed birth control pills_ and I have not had a single headach_ and my pains in my lower abdomin are gone. I would not say I dont recomend it because everyones body is very different and reacts differently to most things. I know I also had problems with the depo shot too. I will say if you have had problems with other birth control dont take the Ortho Cept.,,F,24,1  years.15 1X D,1/26/2012Email,Ortho-cept
32, 4, prevent preg,The only side effect I experience is I get overly emotional (mostly sad) a week before my period. I usually take a different type of BC and I do not get sad like this while I am on that. I do not suffer any mental illness. The sadness is only crying at the drop of a hat or I will get angry over something like dropping a hat.,,F,23,4  months,1/16/2012,Ortho-cept

35, 4, relieve cramps,when i first started orthocept i was 17. it went well only it  made me gain 20lbs! so i stopped taking them. about a year later i tried them again because my cramps would just be way too much for me to handle. ive been on this pill for aout six or seven months and its worked great! its a smaller pack from the last one ive had. ive had no weight gain if anything ive lost a lot of weight! i dont have a big appetite anymore. one thing i absolutely do not like about this pill is every time i start a new pack_ for about the first or second week i get REALLY sick. the more months go by the less sick i am. but i dread the first/second weeks. i have STRONG adversions to food. i work in a restaurant and it sucks when it hits me and i just feel nausious. i only get nausious when its been a couple hours after i take my pill for the day. so about 8 at night i get super sick. other than that its been perfectly fine!,everybodys body is different!,F,18,6  months 1X D,9/24/2011Email,Ortho-cept

37, 3, Birth Control,Not pregnant_ Cleared acne_ no period (skipped the center period ring_ its not a health hazard I checked) If you are late to taking the pill... you'll regret it....,For the first two months I was VERY happy with the pill_ no periods no mood swings_ no spotting_ nothing; nothin' but blue skies. But a couple weeks ago my boyfriend surprised by taking me up to the cabin... didnt have my pills with me; took the pill about 12 hrs later than usual. Now I suffer from dryness during sex_ which in turn causes intense burning after. NO sex drive_ and a dark secretion every day that wont go away for the life of me. I want to cry all the time. Its as if the withdraw of that one day set me back. I went in to PPH but they just told me to hang in the... I gonna go in again tuesday_ and pray they fix this_ because I like sex...,F,18,3  months28 1X D,8/27/2011Email,Ortho-cept
38, 4, Birth Control,acne on shoulders and chin (weird on the shoulders)_ fatigue_ lack of energy and absolutely no sex drive.,I like ortho-cept because I do not get severe mood swings on it. I can handle the acne_ as it is starting to go away_ but I cannot handle losing my sex drive. If this continues_ I will discontinue this medication.  Plus_ I went for a two mile walk tonight and thought I was going to fall asleep walking. It makes me very tired.,F,34,1  months 1X D,8/11/2011Email,Ortho-cept
39, 2, pregnancy prevention,Major depression high anxiety no sex drive,i was fine for a month or so_ anxiety hit early like 2 weeks in. the depression is just getting worse every month. its to the point now that my boyfriend even wants me on a different pill_ he says i was never like this before. so all this crying and feeling bad about myself plus NO SEX. i can hardly even think about having sex. i get highly anxious and depressed when i think about it. terrible mix of hormones for me. i'd like to get off it_ but can't afford the dr visit.,F,31,7  months.15 1X D,7/25/2011Email,Ortho-cept
40, 3, birth control,Nausea_ headaches_ low libido_ spotting_ slight cramps_ increase in appetite.,This birth control prescription was given to me by my gyno. Apparently_ I was given this dosage because of my height so I need a bit of a higher level of hormones_ I guess. I've been taking this for only 8 days. Started on day 1 of my heavy period so I should be safe. The first few days_ nothing was wrong but these past 2-3 days I've been feeling nauseous_ headaches_ and cramping. I take the pill everyday on time during the evening and these symptoms occur hours before the time I should take the pill and hours later so I feel like I never get a break. The smell of some food makes me want to vomit and right now_ I'm currently feeling extremely nauseous as well. =[ After my period was finished_ I've been experiencing spotting but that is probably withdrawal or old blood from just finishing my period. I really want to stop taking the pills but I should probably wait it out for these symptoms to stop. This is my first pack of birth control pills_ ever and I already hate the idea of having to take oral contraceptives. Maybe the dosage is too high for me. I don't know_ but I just wished I didn't want to vomit from just the smell of some food_ all of the other symptoms are easy for me to handle.,F,18,8  days30 1X D,7/16/2011,Ortho-cept
41, 1, Birth Control_ Acne_ Period,NO and I mean NO sex drive_ INSANE mood swings_ CONSTANT anger and HORRIBLE depression.,I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for 8 years.  A couple of years ago I began to develop cystic acne on my chin and a lot of break-through bleeding_ which I never had before.  I thought maybe a change in birth control would help.  I went on Ortho-Cept about 6 months ago.  Since that time my skin and period are doing great_ but I went from a really active sex life to literally having zero sexual desire for my fiance.  And I mean ZERO.  It almost feels like I could go my whole life without ever having sex again.  I'm sure you can guess how that makes him feel.  Not only that_ but the smallest_ tiniest issues set me off.  I'm a total_ raging bitch about every little thing.  And to top it all off within the last month I have been sliding into a deep depression.  These pills are the ABSOLUTE WORST.  I don't feel like myself and I want my life back.  I'm going back on OTC-Lo.,F,28,6  months 1X D,7/1/2011Email,Ortho-cept

44, 2, Prevent pregnancy,Extreme tiredness_ have been sleeping for up to 12 hours per night_ not able to get up earlier than that. Some weight gain_ increased acne_ slight depression.,I was put on Ortho-Cept via Planned Parenthood because I go there for my gyno care because I'm a student and therefore low income. I was on Desogen for about three years with no major problems_ have been on several other types of birth control which I have not been happy with. Planned Parenthood randomly switched me to Ortho-Cept_ saying that they no longer had Desogen available. I know Desogen has the same drugs as Ortho-Cept_ but I've done some research and I guess differences in the binding agents between different brands and generic drugs can make a difference. I am going to get back on Desogen somehow because that is the only birth control which has not had intolerable side effects.,F,24,3  months 1X D,6/26/2011,Ortho-cept
45, 3, Prevent Preg,Tired a lot_ frequent irregular periods_ slight mood changes,I have been taking this pill going on 4 months and so far all I have to complain about is my constant periods. The first month of taking this pill I had a period the whole time_ the 2nd month got my period towards the end of the month going into the next. It stopped for 2 days then I got it again and lasted 8 days it stopped then 2 days later started again and it is going on 5 days now I've had only 4 days this month period free and this is frustrating not only to me but to my fiance as well since I've always had normal periods before.

54, 1, In order to regulate menstrual flow,I've suffered from migraines for years_ but never this bad. I get them almost on a daily basis. Menstrual cramps are more severe as well as acne on face and some on my back.  Mood swings are awful. I've never been a screamer_ now I find myself yelling and my kids and starting fights with my husband. I'm more emotional than normal.,It's not worth taking it.

Before that I was on Depo for 5 years_ had absolutely no sex-drive. I had weight gain on Depo but I've been on Ortho-cept for 2 weeks and so far no weight gain. I noticed my sex drive came back the day I had my Paragard removed. My breasts are growing which is nice because I'm a B cup_ pretty sore though. No other side effects. Actually noticed my mood/irritability got better after switching from Depo/Paragard to Ortho-Cept.,F,21,14  daysMG 1X D,9/14/2010,Ortho-cept
56, 1, Prevent pregnancy/Irregular periods,Acne_ Terrible mood swings_ weight gain_ spotting the entire first month_ severe pms symptoms_ etc...,I was on Yaz for a couple years and then Loestrin 24 until I could no longer afford to see my gyno. So I was prescribed Ortho Cept through planned parenthood. First of all_ you are not supposed to take this birth control if you've had a history of irregular menstrual bleeding or a history of migraine headaches. I have had severe problems with BOTH in the past_ and I clearly told the doctor this and wrote it in my paperwork_ yet she still prescribed me this. I didn't know until now_ but I'm going to stop taking it as of today. Other then that_ I was basically on my period for the entire first month I started taking it. Ever since the first week I've been gaining weight_ probably due to my increased appetite as well_ my acne has increased severely and I even get acne on my back now which I have NEVER had before_ I'm always tired and can sleep for 15 hours if nothing else wakes me up_ I'm extremely extremely extremely moody now and I have never been like that. The smallest things make me go CRAZY and it's affecting all of my personal relationships. During my period my boobs are extremely sore which has never happened to me before.

Also_ for the first 3 months I had a raging yeast infection that did not respond to even the strongest treatments.  The yeast problem has subsided and things have stabilized slightly just from being on it for such a long time_ but the mood/anxiety issues are still very prevalant_ which I haven't noticed with other BCs. This pill was prescribed to me by a practitioner who believed that the balance of fake hormones in this particular pill was better for people with PCOS symptoms.  I haven't noticed that it's helped any better than any other pills.   I guess I haven't gotten pregant_ so that's one plus.,F,25,9  months 1X D,8/9/2010,Ortho-cept
58, 2, birth control,severe mood swings_ nausea,I have been on this birth control for three months because the last one I tried aggrivated my IBS.  While my stomach isn't in stabbing pain anymore_ I recently started feeling nauseous in the morning and I feel like crying all the time.  I got back on birth control in the first place because my boyfriend has a son and we are both concerned about his verility.  However_ with my mood being as unstable I am getting upset with him_ not dealing with stress at all and generally just feel miserable all the time.,F,27,3  months 1X D,7/7/2010,Ortho-cept

Breast tenderness. Very very bitchy! I hate everyone basicly. I'm always mad and pissed off.,This pill is literally a joke. This was the downfall of my life.

62, 5, birth control,painful cramps for the first month_ some weight gain,I have been taking Ortho-Cept for a year now_ and really have not had any major issues. The first two weeks I was on it I was tired and achey and bloated_ but I woke up one day and all of that was gone. I have gained a few pounds_ but have been able to control my weight by exercising and eating right. The thing is_ everyone's bodies are different. From reading the reviews_ you can tell that this clearly works for some_ but not for others_ which i definitely important to remember.,F,21,1  years 1X D,5/3/2010,Ortho-cept
63, 2, Birth Control,Acne_ weight gain_ increased intensity of my migraines_ increased appetite_ period not shorter or lighter_ cramping_ bloating,I initially started taking BC to help with my migraines. I was on an awesome pill for over 10 years. Now I no longer have insurance so Ortho-Cept was what became available to me. I noticed side effects right away_ but after reading some reviews that said it needs a few months to work_ I decided to try. My periods never got lighter or shorter_ I would break out (I have never had acne_ not even as a teen) I gained 30 pounds (and I race bicycles and run marathons) so I was not sitting around. My appetite increased_ and most of all_ my migraines became worse. A week before and during the week of my period I had cramping_ bloating_ and migraines everyday. I don't know what I will take instead_ but I quit taking this.,F,37,1  years 1X D,4/20/2010,Ortho-cept
64, 2, regulate periods,acne_ mood swings_ overall feelings of depression,I was prescribed this bc pill to help regulate my periods and to help with some hormonal issues I was suffering with due to PCOS.  It made it worse.  I have gone from a bit of acne now and then to being broken out on my face_ chest_ and arms (very unusual for me) since the day after I started taking this pill.  I find myself fine one minute_ mad at my husband or kids for no real reason the next minute_ and crying the minute after that.  Over the last 2 weeks I've realized I feel very down and have to make myself do my regular activities like working out_ gardening_ etc.  I just feel and look like crap right now and am asking my dr today to prescribe me something else.,F,28,28  days.03mg 1X D,4/14/2010,Ortho-cept

Mild cramps_ fatigue & an increase in acne.,Besides the irritating breakouts on my face_ I haven't really had bad side effects with this pill. No decrease in sex drive_ slight mood swings_ but not as bad as before_ and no weight gain. yet...I have an increased appetite so I should start eating more healthy haha.  I am only 2 weeks into this so I have to see if it gets better or worse_ or if I like it enough to stay on it.,F,27,16  days 1X D,4/7/2010Email,Ortho-cept
66, 5, birth control,Lighter periods,I've been using Ortho Cept for about 6 months and have not seen any negative side effects. My periods have always been regular_ though much lighter and shorter than they were before starting birth control. This is the first birth control pill I've used and it has worked great so far. No mood swings or significant weight gain_ or difference in skin/hair conditions. Plus I'm not pregnant so it's definitely working! I would definitely recommend this birth control to my friends.,F,20,6  months10 1X D,2/24/2010,Ortho-cept
67, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Severe cramps_ 10-15 pounds weight gain_ and severe mood swings,Hey girls     I will have to day that this pill has honestly been both the best and worst thing that has happened to me_ it has kept me from getting pregnant..but_ in the process I have gained 10-15 pounds. And for me that alone is enough t be depressed from. I no longer fit in anyof my jeans. I work out  at least 3 times a week now and I am still having difficultly loosing weight. The worst side effect for me overall are the mood swings_ sometimes I think I could be legally insane from these pills. The difference from before taking these pills to now.... Is like nigh and dAy. One minute I'm angry and irratBle about nothing and the next I'm crying over a cute commercial. It has caused alot of hard times between my boyfriend and I of 2 years. Due to my drastic mood swings. I do not reccomend this pill to anyone. I recently have been perscrible to orthro tri cyclen low after telling my doctor my side effects. We hope that because the pill has half the dossage of ortho cept. It will better regualte my mood swings. Also the fact that the pills come in three dieefernt dossages has sonethings to do with how they should help. So talk to your doctor if u are experiencing anything like I have...

70, 2, Birth control/regulation,I just switched to Ortho-cept last month from Zovia. It's a little less than a week before my period and I'm already starting to experience fairly bad PMS symptoms. I was bloated and started retaining water. I began having cramps 5 days before my period (I've only ever had them the day before my period_ with or without birth control). and I started having extreme mood swings. One minute I'm super irritable and any little thing pisses me off... 30 minutes later I'm crying my eyes out for absolutely no reason. I've never had any of these symptoms with my old birth control pills or even without any pills.,,F,23,17  days,1/27/2010Email,Ortho-cept
71, 4, Birth Control,My face has been breaking out like crazy which didn't ever happen before I started taking it_ boobs got a little bigger but not much_ periods are a lot more manageable because they are shorter and way lighter_ gained some weight (I don't know if it's from this though),I pretty much like everything about it except that it's making me break out which is so disgusting. I wash my face and apply medication every morning and night and pimples still come out of nowhere which is EXTREMELY frustrating because as soon they start to go away and my skin starts looking decent_ more appear.,F,19,3  months,12/18/2009,Ortho-cept

76, 4, Endometriosis_ contraception,Breast growth and tenderness_ FAR less painful periods_ lighter periods_ clearer skin_ nausea_ low sex drive_ nervousness.,I switched to Ortho Cept when my clinic stopped carrying Desogen. I like Ortho Cept well enough; it keeps my periods regular_ light_ and relatively painless. I haven't gotten pregnant even though I take my pills irregularly (take them late_ stop taking for two weeks at a time_ sometimes skip pills because I forget_ etc). I've never had a problem with acne_ I would just get the occasional pimple_ but now even that's not an issue. My complaints are that my sex drive is very low while on Ortho Cept and I get a lot of light nausea. I'm naturally a rather nervous/anxious person but I feel that being on Ortho Cept makes my anxiety worse. Luckily I haven't had most of the common birth control side effects: I haven't gained even a single pound_ I never have headaches_ and I don't get mood swings_ not even on my period. Overall Ortho Cept has been pretty good and I recommend it. HOWEVER_ I recently stopped taking Ortho Cept (can't afford it anymore) and I did have some problems after stopping: pimples on my face_ greasy hair_ oily skin_ slight scalp hair loss_ and mood swings. None of it is a huge deal_ but be prepared for some issues when you go off birth control.,F,20,7  months,9/19/2009,Ortho-cept

I tried soooo many things including different birth control pills.  I was getting severe headaches on my last pill (Yaz) so my Dr switched me to Ortho Cept for headaches and acne_ and I have basically gotten rid of my acne!  I have not noticed any changes in my sex drive_ I actually think it increased_ and no mood swing problems.  I am extremely happy with this.  The only thing I have noticed is my periods are off.

Recently moved and have been bounced around to other generic versions (Reclipsin from one pharmacy_ degestrol (sp?) from another). I spoke with my doctor about switching and even though the estrogen is the same_ I may be reacting to the other stuff which varies between brands. On the degertrol (sp?) now and my skin is very oily. Might switch back to reclipsin to see how that goes. I think the decrease in sex is due to the stress of moving and 8 years of marriage (ha ha).,F,34,5  years,5/3/2008,Ortho-cept

My face has also started to break out which is weird since i have never had bad skin. I have some breast tenderness but i realize that is normal when on most types of birth control. I haven't experienced any mood changes or weight gain but i also work out at least 4 days a week. I may also have been having an increase in sex drive (according to my boyfriend) but i don't see a change maybe i'm just expressing it more?,I'm going to stay on it for another month and then see what happens_ if i continue to have these problems i'm going to switch but i'll get back to ya,F,21,20  days,4/13/2008,Ortho-cept

That's a big down side for me_ I almost stopped taking it_ but I figured I'll wait and see if it goes away after some time.  One night I even sat and cried for 10 minutes like a baby but for no reason!  My appetite has surged and I want to eat again right after I finish a meal.  And it's like I have NO willpower... I am usually very careful and consistent in my eating habits... also_ I am quite fatigued and it takes a lot of pushing myself to get my butt to the gym.  All of this is extremely out of character and out of my comfort zone.

It definitely wasn't! Almost instantly_ my breasts began to grow (great!) and become unbelievably sore and tender (not so great!).  Then_ I started noticing some pretty intense crankiness.  I took a trip to see my long-distance boyfriend and realized that I had absolutely no sex drive.  I didn't get pregnant while on this pill but if I would have stayed on it my mood swings and lack of sex drive would have ensured I would have no opportunity to.  This was all after a month of taking Ortho-Cept--when I got back home I immediately went to my doc and got Ortho TriCyclen Lo.  I started having breast soreness after the second week; unfortunately_ but I researched pills on the internet and found the one I used to take that I was quite happy with (Desogen) and am going to switch back to that.,F,28,21  days,5/28/2005,Ortho-cept
