0, 5, RA,I don't know if it is related to the Xeljanz_ but i have sinus headaches and maybe a sinus infection. I guess that can be from the medication. Hard to say. I was wondering if taking only one pill a day would still keep the RA away and lessen the side effects. This med is like a miracle for me. I am not even stiff in the morning and am back to being active.,With insurance and discount card I got this medication for nothing.,F,55,3  weeks5 mg 2/day,4/9/2015Email,Xeljanz
1, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,,This is a correction to the review on 2014-09-30.  I took this drug at a dosage of 5 mg twice daily_ *not* 30 mg twice daily.  That matters because there was an attempt to get this drug approved at a higher dose than the standard 5mg twice daily.  I wanted to make sure people weren't confused about my review.,M,36,90  days5 mg 2X D,10/27/2014,Xeljanz
2, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Nothing I felt_ except maybe the mildest fogginess on the first few days of taking the drug.  It did make my cholesterol numbers go up by 20%.,I was very happy with this drug for Psoriatic Arthritis.  It did not work as well as Humira or Remicade_ but at least I could tolerate the side effects.,M,36,90  days30 mg 2X D,9/30/2014Email,Xeljanz
3, 1, Rheumatoid Arthritis,Stomach symptoms of queasiness_ discomfort_ just short of the Ulcer symptoms I was cured of 25 years ago. After 3 stop/start intervals_ my doc said NO MORE.  I stopped completely.  Of interest: There was some kind of negative rebound effect.  after I resumed the 3rd time to determine if the stomach symptoms would stop_ the Xeljanz lost whatever RA symptom  suppression effect there may have been.  I was in worse shape than when I started.  For me_ something not good about this drug.  If you try_ watch it  closely.,,M,83,104  days5mg 2X D,3/26/2014EmailHistory,Xeljanz
