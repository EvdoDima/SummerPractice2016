3, 5, Depression,None whatsoever.  Occasional constipation but tolerable,Being a professional nurse_ I knew the side effects and mechanism of action of many anti-depressants. I have tried many antidepressants to treat my depression.  This has been the only medication that has actually worked for me.  Increased energy_ alertness_ and overall positive mood.  Before this medication I had zero energy_ slim to no appetite_ and no desire to get out of the bed each day.  It took about 2-4 weeks to tell a difference after starting the medication.  Not sure why TCAs aren't prescribed more often.  Only downside to this medication is that since it is an older generation TCA_ not many pharmacies carry it.  But well worth it_ changed my life for the better.,M,26,3  months5mg 1X D,11/30/2014Email,Vivactil
4, 2, migraine headaches,Dry mouth_ anxiety_ dizziness.,Caused anxiousness in the morning when it kicked in @15MG. Had to use xanax to counteract. No noticeable effects for headaches_ as prescribed.,M,35,2  months5 3X D,12/2/2013,Vivactil
5, 1, Major Depression with anhedonia,I had tachycardia and almost died trying to exercise with a pulse of over 200bpm!,It did nothing for my anhedonia or depression,M,20,2  months5 MG 5X D,11/8/2012,Vivactil
6, 5, depression_ anxiety,none -- I had sexual side effects (low desire_ no orgasm) but they went away.,I've tried every antidepressent_ and every SSRI causes sexual dysfunction that never gets better no matter how long I stay on the drug. Vivactil caused anorgasmia in the beginning_ but after several weeks_ it wore off! Never had that happen. It helps but does not fix my depression.,F,52,3  months 2X D,11/26/2011,Vivactil
7, 4, depression_ anxiety,insomnia_ anorgasmia_ constipation_ dry mouth,Vivactil works far better for me than anything else I've tried -- Prozac_ Wellbutrin_ Paxil_ a slew of supposedly cleaner and better drugs. It both calms me down and energizes me -- hard to describe. I'm more focused on others_ less on myself. It has me on the thin side because it does take away the appetite a bit_ but no complaints there. The worst of it is the sexual side effect -- low libido_ no orgasm_ little feeling. I don't know if I'll be able to tolerate this in the long run_ but for now it's helping me navigate this awful time of perimenopause/PMDD. The constipation is not terrible_ the insomnia's getting better and the dry mouth can be managed with lots of fluids and gum.,F,52,2  weeks15 mg 1X D,7/20/2011Email,Vivactil
8, 1, Migraines,-Difficult urinating-Difficult Ejaculating-Woke up 2-3 times a night to urinate,I am winding down taking Vivactil.  Since lowering my dosaged my headaches have decreased.  This was presribed to prevent migraines but I think it triggering daily headaches.,M,35,8  months10MG 3X D,3/18/2010,Vivactil
9, 5, Depression,No negative side effects thus far_ However an increased libido and sensitivity is apparent..A side effect I don't mind one bit..No dry mouth as of yet_ And it hasn't effected my sleep or anything.,Been on this medication for about a week now to treat depression_ And can safely say it's already had a positive effect. And look forward to the coming week's of use..Surely worth a try for anyone who suffers from depression..,M,27,7  days,10/12/2009,Vivactil
10, 4, 2009,PROTRIPTYLINE  dry mouth.,thanks groovyboho.com,F,44,1  years,9/21/2009,Vivactil
11, 5, Depression,None!  Unless you consider sexual activation to be a side effect - libido_ arousal and sensation are all increased.  Although protriptyline is supposed to be somewhat anticholinergic_ I have no significant problem with dry mouth_ less than with desipramine.,Id give this more than a 5 rating if I could.  As one of the earlier posters said_ it is a mystery why protriptyline is not prescribed more. Partly this must be because it is in the older TCA class (although I am very supportive of new drug development_ expiration of patent protection means that an older drug will not be promoted_ no matter how effective it is).      I am a neuroscience professor and have tried many different options_ including Wellbutrin_ Celexa_ Effexor_ Pristiq_ Cymbalta_ and Desipramine.  Although effexor worked well for depression_ the sexual side effects were worse than I was willing to put up with.  Protriptyline has made me feel actually cheerful for the first time since I came down with depression about a year and a half ago.  According to my wife_ I am better than for the last 30 years...    I find a fairly low dose works best for me (for this medication and the others)_ less than the usual recommended amount. I dont know if this would be true for other people.  I gradually increase the dose of any new med until it starts working less well and then go back down to the amount that worked best.,M,53,2  months,5/10/2009,Vivactil
12, 5, depression,None at all (amazing for me),I have treatment resistant depression and am very sensitive to side effects.  This is the only antideppressant that has EVER worked for me.  It is amazing_ and I'm perplexed as to why doctors don't prescribe it more.  Lifts your energy_ too.  No weight gain.  I had absolutely no side effects. Downside:  it wears off quickly_ have to take at least two a day. Also_ the generic did not work for me.,F,35,3  months,10/12/2006,Vivactil
13, 5, Migraines/Depression & panic,Dry mouth_ constipation_ both very manageable; not bad at all.,I was put on this drug for Migraines. I was previously taking Remeron for the migraines_ which worked wonderfully_ but had the unpleasant side effect of 35 lb weight gain and fatigue.Thankfully my Dr. had me try this Vivactil on a daily basis_ which has helped me immensely without the weight gain problem. Actually the Vivactil has curbed my appetite somewhat. This drug has also helped me with panic/depression. I highly recommend trying this drug for migraines. The side effects are minimal & tolerable. Vivactil has given me much relief from migraines and the depression that go along with migraine headaches.,F,48,3  years,9/26/2006,Vivactil
