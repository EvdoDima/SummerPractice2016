7, 2, Allergies_ congestion,I took this for a year with no problems. However_ there periods of sweating that I had not attributed to Mucinex_ but when I stopped taking Mucinex_ the sweats also went away. But the absolute worst was the heart palpitations -I went to the hospital_ I thought I was having a heart attack! Loud_ strong palpitations. $3_000 later_ I realize it is the Mucinex that caused both problems. I'm done with this.,,F,56, 1 2X D,1/20/2016Email,Mucinex

17, 3, Congestion in sinus' and chest,Dizziness_ palpitations_ sleeplessness_ high energy_ less congestion_ still sick.,I have taken 2 doses of the Mucinex-D. 2 tablets every 12 hours. I may have a lower tolerance for this medicine and possibly dehydrated in a way. ( Ive been drinking at least 40 oz of water) Still end up with the shakes and feel very uneasy after a few hours of it being in my system. Although I dont enjoy feeling this way_ it has broken up my chest congestion and has kept my nose from being stuffy. I need to blow my nose every 3 minutes and that gets irritating_ but Id rather have a runny nose than a stuffed one :)  Im not sure if Id recommend this product if other people have the same side effects_ but not everyone is the same_ so I say try it and see what happens. If you are an anxious person by nature_ then Id probably suggest taking something a little less harsh on your system.,F,34,1  days600-60mg 1X D,5/12/2015Email,Mucinex

21, 1, Cough & congestion,Nausea_ pounding heartbeat.,I'm a heart patient and was told regular Mucinex was ok to take. I took 2 tablets and within an hour I felt very nauseous. After approximately 2 hours I could feel my heart pounding. It only lasted a couple hours_ but that was enough to know I wouldn't be taking it again.
