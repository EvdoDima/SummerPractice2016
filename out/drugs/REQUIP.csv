0, 3, RLS,I wake-up twisting and can't seem to get comfortable. I also have nausea and heartburn. My heart is racing and I am more anxious until the dosage wears off.,The Requip has completely dispelled the RLS which I have had for at least 15 years. For that I am greatful_ but the side effects keep me awake just as much as the RLS would if I hadn't taken Requip. I am hoping the side effects go away.,F,38,4  days 1X D,6/29/2016Email,Requip

3, 1, Restless Legs,Nausa with high dose_ makes you very sick but lower dose fixes this problem.  After starting this medication RLS is much worse if something happens you run out of your medication.

Since then my symptoms at home have gotten less aggressive and I've been able to cut back.  However if I go to someone else's home where they have a microwave I have to bring extra pills with me.

12, 3, Muscle Spasms-RLS or Fibro related,Extreme naseau (especially in 1st 2 weeks)_ weight gain_ hand swelling_ almost passed out in shower multiple times_ effects multiplied if taken with Benadryl.,This medicine worked immediately the first night. It was amazing. I still had soreness in my calves but could sleep! However I was extremely out of it_ hardly able to function the first few mornings. I finally figured out it was worse the more Benadryl I took (for allergies). After stopping the Benadryl the mornings were still foggy but manageable. However I still had occasional times showering where I almost passed out and felt weak for hours afterwards. Then at week 3 it started to not quite work as well and the weight gain started. I think I am up 10 lbs and this is with increasing my exercise significantly to try and offset the medicine. I also have had increased gas and stomach pain that lasts from about 4 PM to 11 AM. I do however have Crohn's Disease so I am not completely sure the Requip is causing this. Due to the increase in stomach pain and weight gain I am discontinuing this medicine.,F,35,6  weeks1 mg,4/28/2015,Requip

15, 3, RLS,i have taken this drug for several years - successfully to treat rls symptoms_ primarily at night.  however_ in 3 recent incedents_  this drug has caused SERIOUS blood pressure drop during air travel.  at first i thought it was diet related/drug usage (rls).  but_ with further investigation_ i have proven to myself that it in fact is a reaction to the drug itself.  blood pressure bottomed out at 60/40 during flight.   BE VERY CAREFUL when taking this_ if you are going to be traveling by airplane.,excellent treatment - at home -  for rls.  but DANGEROUS for air travel to minimize rls during flight.   60/40 bp is near-dead.  scared me.   i highly recommend this for at-home use_ but will not use it again during travel.,M,58,10  years 1X AN,11/17/2014Email,Requip

18, 1, RLS,I watched my mother experience fatigue_ tiredness_ confusion and general dementia like symptoms.,Get OFF this medicine.  Please. It works at first and bites like a snake later on.  My mom was experiencing all sorts of dementia like symptoms and was looking like a zombie.  She was going downhill rapidly.  Called a friend to talk and she told me her mom had the same thing and this med was a contributing factor among other things that led to her death.  When I heard this my mom was off the medicine that night.  In one day her mind started clearing.  The fog was lifting and mental clarity was returning (though not completely).  It was like I had my mother back.  The downhill slide has slowed.  To deal with her RLS we have used every single homeopathic remedy every day.  Not sure what is working but something is doing the trick.  It hasn't gone away but is greatly reduced.  Now we're trying to figure out her sleep.  She was on Ambian and that was the miracle drug until it too turned bad.  FDA is now calling for different guidelines as it has been a problem.  So for what it is worth_ here are the alternative things we are using for mom's RLS that are working.  And yes_ we are using all of them at the present time.  Once we figure out her sleep (years of insomnia) then we can maybe start removing these to find which one has been the remedy that is doing the trick.  But thank God someone warned us about this drug.  It's demonic.  So here's what's working:Vitamin B12 (with methylfolate since our blood work showed inability to metabolize).Vitamin EOmega 3's,F,67,150  days.50 1X D,5/9/2014,Requip
19, 1, RLS,I am not a fan on this drug. I'm sad to report that I've just been through an awful ordeal with my mother because of this_ which I didn't believe until I researched this drug. She developed seriously uncharacteristic behavior where she was engaging in risky sexual behavior with men she didn't know. She got caught up in an internet romance scam. I've hardly recognized her lately. This was a professional_ honest_ and great person who has just crumbled. We are getting her help but the behavior perfectly aligns with her taking this medication. I believe the side effects are rare but they are certainly scary as hell. I hope others will be quite vigilant about the risks and mitigate more quickly than I did.,,F,65,9  months--,4/23/2014,Requip

26, 3, RLS,headaches_ neck pain_ joint pain_ weight gain_ feel hung over next day,Since I have gained 10 lbs in 2 months while maintaining the same lifestyle and am also experiencing other side effects_ I am decreasing my dosage and plan on discontinuing requip.  The only good thing I can say is that it does work for restless legs.  Since I am planning on discontinuing this drug I have been researching other possible causes and solutions.  What I have found is that RLS may be caused by magnesium. B1 and/or folic acid deficiency.  I have not started taking any supplements but before starting requip_ I would occasionally take vitamin E as my mother in law said it worked for her.  The last couple of nights I have taken vitamin e when my legs have started becoming restless while sitting on the couch and the RLS subsided.  I'm not recommending anything but suggest you check around on the net to find this information as well.  My symptoms do seem to match up with magnesium deficiency and am interested to see if I notice improvement when I start taking it.  My Dr. said there was no known cause for RLS but decided to do my own research.  Also the supplements are inexpensive and are likely to have fewer side effects.  Also makes more sense to solve the problem than treat the symptoms.  Just reading all your comments makes me think there's got to be a better way and if by some chance this information helps anyone_ I thought it worth passing along.

It's incredibly painful and I've taken 2 Advil_ 2 Excedrin migraine_ and topped it with 2 Vicodin_ with no relief.

Rarely have the energy to do much at all.,My RLS got worse very fast_ so they kept adding higher doses. I started out on the .25 just in the evening_ but the symptoms got worse and worse. About a year into taking Requip I was having symptoms during the day_ and sometimes in my arms and torso. By that time I was taking 3MG  3 times a day_ and 4MG at bedtime (total 13 MG per day) The symptoms still got worse_ so they added Neurontin_ starting at 100 MG  3 times a day_ then finally worked up to 1500 MG a day. That had too many side effects_ so discontinued that. Just went to neurologist today and he said it sounds like the medicine has augmented my RLS_ made it worse_ and wants to wean me off as soon as possible. He's putting  me on Nortriptyline now. I hope it works_. I have no energy_ can hardly watch any movies cos I fall asleep after just a few minutes_ can't drive more than about 10 miles without falling asleep_ but when I lie down to sleep I have insomnia.

Dr. thought it was a bad drug so changed to Requip_ 1mg. then 2_ then 3_ now 5-6mg. I don't believe there is a medication that you can stay on that works for very long. A new medication is on the market now _ its a form of Neurontin_ a medication for peripheral neuropathy. But as a diabetic I already take Neurontin. Maybe we all need to start wearing arm bands for our cause like everybody else_ as I see it_ there's not a whole lot of research going on for this_ if people could just sleep ( or try to sleep) one night like we do it might be different.

41, 4, RLS_ Neuropathy_ Pain_ Muscle Cramp,"Drowsiness if taken during the day. Gastric bloating (minor). Slight appetite suppression. Morning ""fogginess"" (minor)",Requip helps suppress some of the pain and spasms experienced from neuropathy. Mostly caused by impingements in the C Spine on down. I take a low dose and usually only at bedtime when needed. Sleep quality has improved when using Requip. If symptoms become bothersome during the day_ I may take a light dose for some relief. When taking Requip during the day_ I will not drive or use anything that could be considered hazardous. I take other medications that can cause drowsiness and it seems that Requip adds to the effect substantially. It's a good thing when trying to sleep_ but not great during the day. I am also Vit D deficient and have chronically low levels of Sodium. The appetite suppression adds to the issue_ since I do eat less and as a result I need to watch my electrolyte levels. I stay well hydrated. The first symptom that something is off would be severe nocturnal leg cramps. These preceeded my use of Requip_ so it was not caused by Requip_ but seem to have become more frequent since taking Requip. Taking some extra Magnesium and Potassium seems to help_ along with a cup of canned soup for sodium. I also eat a banana several times a week. I take large Vit D supplements weekly. Calcium supplements as well. Calcium blood levels are fine and never appeared to be low.,M,58,8  months.5 - 1mg 1X D,1/29/2012Email,Requip

45, 1, restless leg syndrome,pain in hand like being randomly stabbed with an ice pick_ pain in feet and other places with no explanation.  Severely augmented on it after 6 months and had symptoms coming earlier and earlier in the day.,I've had RLS since childhood but it got much worse after menopause.  I only put a name to the problem a few months before the Requip TV campaign_  Doc put me on Requip at my request.  The hand pain started within a month_ but since I had osteoarthritis in other joints_ he thought that was the answer.  Then I augmented and couldn't even sit still during the day let alone at night to sleep.  It was only after stopping Requip for that reason that I discovered that my hand and other strange pain went away within 48 hrs of last dose.  Doc didn't believe me at first.  Tried Mirapex_ but it made the problem worse.  During hip replacement surgery_ I discovered that hydrocodone does just as good a job as Requip with no side effects_ so I've been able to convince Doc for 4 years to keep me on that.  Since I have OA and RA pain_ it's doing double duty and I've very happy on it.  I'm not at all afraid of addiction_ only 3% of those on narcotics for pain ever become addicted.  I hope to stay on the Hydro for the forseeable future.,F,57,6  months10 1X D,12/1/2011,Requip

It started 1 month after a ""complete"" hysterectomy. I've been taking Xanax at night which helped with the twitches but didn't stop them completely. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 2 years ago_ but I think the onset of the fibro was associated with the hysterectomy and a pending divorce. I went to 5 doctors who poo-poo'ed the twitches. My new rheumatologist said the twitches were contributing to my fibro exhaustion. We tried Mirapex - no improvement and caused severe depression. Generic Requip gave me total relief the first night. I always take it on a full stomach to prevent GI upset. The only issue is the drugged feeling I have during the day. I'm optimistic that my body will adjust. My suggestion to everyone is to start at a very low dosage. Take a tablespoon of peanut butter before taking the med.

Most side is mild to moderate nausea.Side effects: mild to moderate nausea;  but since it does provide even slight improvement in RLS symptoms I take it. Tegretol did wonders for my RLS. I originally started taking the Tegretol for seizures and it completely stopped the RLS. THAT was a miracle drug for over a decade. A year ago it stopped working and I was put on Requip at a sleep center.The only really good thing about Requip_ in my experience_ has been the commercials. It's increased awareness of RLS.,,F,49,1  years1 MG 2X D,8/17/2011,Requip

For 3 years just .5 MG did the trick. I was finally able to get to sleep and stay asleep. Eventually had to move up to 1MG on year 4 then up to 1.5MG starting on year 5. I did some research and found that smoking interferes with Requip.

61, 3, Restless Leg Syndrome,I am so glad I stumbled upon this web site....I have been taking Requip for my RLS (my husband refers to it as 'jimmy legs').  It has relieved my RLS symptoms and I sleep much better than before_ HOWEVER I have had a weight gain of 70 pounds since starting the med...and have the ringing in the ears....and HOT all the time - almost cannot stand it in the Iowa summers...we have central air AND a window AC in the bedroom because we can't afford to keep the entire house as cold as I need it....and my husband has an electric blanket on his side of the bed!  (Electric company LOVES us!).  Until just recently I had not associated these symptoms to the Requip because shortly after starting the med I had a complete hysterectomy and blamed the weight gain and perpetual hot flash on that...now I am not so sure.  I was on hormonal replacement for several years but stopped that 2 years ago due to the weight gain.  I am a nurse - do lots of walking both at home and at work_ do Zoomba_ and eat MAYBE,,,45,4  years4 1X D,6/10/2011Email,Requip

65, 3, RLS,I have noticed quite a few side effects_ the one that is most troubling though is sleep paralysis. I will wake up in the middle of the night and it feels like my whole body is paralyzed_ it takes a few moments for my body to come back to itself and the experience is nothing short of frightening. I noticed that it seems to only happen when I am sleeping on my back. I have not heard of anyone else with this sort of side effect. Another strange thing I have noticed since I started taking Requip is a sound I hear in my head as I'm falling asleep_ sometimes. Like the sleep paralysis it doesn't happen every night_ but every once in a while I hear just as I'm falling asleep the sound of snapping or just one loud snap. It almost sounds like the snap of electricity. When it first started happening it would jolt me up_ but I have gotten use to it and the sound has gotten quieter and quieter. It may sound crazy_ but I don't know what else to attribute it to. I have described it to my wife as soun,When I first started with I thought everything was going great. I was sleeping better and thought I had found this life saving medicine. As time go's by though the side effects seem to worsen. I have decided to give requip a break for a while and see if things have changed. If the sleep issues come back I may need to start taking it again_ but I will have to weigh the pro's and con's of this medication again before I hop right back on.,M,28,3  years2MG 1X D,2/21/2011Email,Requip

I am in the Army and the weight could ruin my 16 yr career. As for impulsive behaviors... I have a new tattoo on my shoulder to prove it to you!

This made the nausea worse. Yes_ the symptoms did get much worse after I had my son at age 30_ but two years later when I hurt my knee and couldn't run. The symptoms didn't until I hurt my leg and couldn't run for a year_ now I have to take meds daily. I moved away from Lincoln_ NE to DC and I went to a RLS specialist. It was then that I was put on Requip and had all these problems. I didn't put two and two together because I had just moved. I though the symptoms were from the stress of the move and living in DC. I asked the doc this week if I could go off the Requip and she said no. She did give me Sinemet again_ but she STRONGLY feels that this will make my symptoms worse at an earlier age and I will have to increase my dosage more regularly. I have already gone one day without the requip and I know it takes a few to get out of your system_ but the nausea has already subsided! That is huge for me. Personally_ I plan to look for a new doctor_ stay on sinimet as long as possible and as soon as the fatigue subsides start running again. I really think that is the key_ regular exercise_ regular sleep and wake up times.

102, 1, RLS,I have gained 40 pounds in the last 4 years; additionally_ I have been vomiting a couple of nights a week for two years. I've had all kinds of tests to determine why I've been vomiting_ only to have them all come back negative. Now I read the website and find that vomiting is just one of the side effects. Yes_ the drup works for RLS_ but only if I don't throw it up. And now I know why I've felt like I'm wandering around underwater for the last 3 - 4 years.

My sleep seems more disrupted from the drug than the disorder.  Also experienced hyopsexual activity and thinking.  Not a good thing.

In one year_ I have reached with maximum dosage with more side effects.  I had nausea from the low dosage but it lasts only half an hour to an hour.  I accidentally found antidote for it.  It is a peanut butter sandwich cracker.  It's better to eat it before nausea starts but it still works even when I'm already feeling sick.  It usually takes effect within 2 to 3 sandwich crackers.  However_ there is nothing I can do to fight against sleepiness.  I'm having swelling of my legs lately.   My feet and hands are constantly cramping up.

114, 3, RLS,depression_ anxiety_ anger_ restlessness_ inability to concentrate_ loss of interest_ sexuality issues,I have had RLS for more than 40 yrs.  It was well controlled with Sinimet with few side effects.  In Spring of 08 I underwent a complete hysterectomy and the Sinimet quite working within hours.  The doctor doubled the dose_ then tripled the dose and I was still miserable.  I would pace for hours_ the RLS went into my hands and arms_ I cried for hours on end.  I was switched to Requip .25 three times a day.  That helped a little so it was doubled to .25 six times a day.  I now have control of the RLS about 60% of the time.  Between the RLS and Requip I feel as if my life is ruined.  Either the side effects are bothering me or the RLS is.  It controls my life.  I have to plan around it all the time.  Some nights I get little sleep_ I need to allow extra time for driving because I either stop to pace or start feeling sleepy and stop to get awake_ I have to plan where to sit in meetings because I have to get up because of the RLS or feeling sleepy.  The depression is very bad.  I sometimes cry for hours on end.  The anger and anxiety are bad.  But I don't know what to do.  I can't live with the RLS as is and I can't seem to get anymore relief with anything else.  This is ruining both my professional and personal life.

116, 5, RLS,This is an update to a post I made a couple of years ago.I've been on Requip almost five years now.  Here's what I experience now:1.  My daily dose has been stable now for almost two years. .5 about 1pm_  .5 around 11pm and another 1mg just before I go to bed. The 1pm dose stops the rebound effect which I only get when I forget to take the afternoon dose.2. I continue to experience increased libido but for the past year _decreased sensitivity. Could the the decreased senstivity may be due to age? Its similar to useing a condom.3.  I've almost forgoten that I have RLS. I never wake up in the middle of the night anymore.I now use a generic brand (Ropinirole) and find it works faster.  It may be my imagination_ but if I let it disolve in my mouth it kicks in much faster. That didn't happen with the brand name version. This generic brand is more disolvable then the brand name.  I prefer it now.,Has anyone used the Requip Extended Release?  I'm very pleased with Ropinirole.  I would reccomend it to anyone_ but you gotta give it time!  I would tell anyone considering it_ to give it at least a year to find the more or less effetive dose for you. IT may take even longer for the perfect dose for your individual need. Ask your doctor to have the pharmacist give it to you in .05mg tabs with an order to take something like 2mg daily as needed. You can adjust your dose more easily with the smaller tabs.,M,68,5  years,5/11/2009Email,Requip

Nothing major just cats climbing under the bed and we don't have a cat_ but I know it's a hallucination when it happens. Wake up around 4 AM the fall right back to sleep_ and have some joint pain in hands and wrists. Also wake up with numb hands now but goes away fast. Sweaty too.,All in all Requip is a God send for me. I was having to take atleast 2 naps durring the day just to function. I thought I had cancer or something.

146, 4, Parkinson's,"I've experienced the usual stuff (grogginess_ weight gain_ joint stiffness_ mild swelling in hand) but overall have tolerated the drug well and it has helped. However_ I'm extremely concerned about my eyes. Several months into taking 9 mg of Requip per day_ I had a posterior vitreous detachment(vitreous pulls away from retina) resulting in a mammoth floater. Dr. said it's quite common ""as we age"" and generally harmless. Had another one in same eye a few months later and one in other eye_ too_ so I have to deal with big floaters. Now I have an ""epiretinal membrane"" growing which is blurring the central vision in one eye (it is operable if it gets worse). I also see a black vascular-like pattern/after-image right after I close and open my right eye; plus I've noticed an odd flash of light when I move my eyes from one side of the TV screen to the other.","Even with all this my vision is still fine and easily correctable to 20/20. But I'm in the process of increasing my dosage of requip and am wondering if I'm crazy for continuing this medication. My ophthalmologist doesn't think it's related and my neurologist seemed unaware of the ""vision problems"" side effect. Has anyone else experienced what I have???",F,59,21  months,7/13/2008,Requip

148, 4, RLS,Had RLS for about 12 years although I never knew what it was for years. Diagnosed with MS 14 years ago and thought it was another symptom. Started on starter pack and went up to 2mg. Side effects include severe night sweats_ severe augmentation from 5p.m. including to the arms_ severe nasal congestion- unable to breathe without using nasal spray. Neurologist has reduced dose to 1mg which takes longer to kick in- 2 hours before bed seems to work. Wake a little earlier in the morning but as long as I'm getting a night's sleep I'll stick with it. Valium 2m.g was the best drug I ever took for RLS- worked like a dream for 2 years and then suddenly stopped_ apparently you get used to it .. Luckily I had no withdrawal problems_ just stopped taking it.Will stick with ropinirole until that also stops working.,Although the augmentation is awful- I never had RLS in the day_ the benefits of a full night's sleep are immeasurable. Before Requip ( called adartrel in the UK) I slept 1-2 hours a night because of the leg twitching and spasms. I think I'm prepared to put up with the side effects to be able to sleep for the first time in YEARS! Fascinating to read how many people have suffered night sweats on this drug- when I mentioned it to my neurologist_ he had never heard of it and suggested my GP follow up with some tests. Now I know why I'm getting them.I understand this drug is expensive in the USA but luckily  we are blessed with the NHS in England  so  I only pay the base standard presrciption charge of £6 for 2 months supply ( $10),F,48,1  days,6/11/2008Email,Requip

Requip does help to relieve the restless legs although sometimes it is slow to work_ and if I take it earlier_ it makes me so sleepy that I can't enjoy the evening hours.  However_ I have been feeling so bad lately that I went to see my doctor.  He did blood work that did not show anything. He thought that switching to Mirapex might help_ but I'm just not sure.  I have extreme pain in my feet_ some numbness and tingling in my hands_ and just feel strange most of the time.  I have a very short attention span_ am irritable or angry most of the time which is just not me.  This is affecting my work and home life.

I have had 2 migraines. I have had no numbness_ swelling or actual fainting (though as I mentioned I came very close). I have only vomitted on 2 occassions while taking sinus medicine with requip.

I have increased my Gloucosimine (sp) for the joint stuff.  Iron used to help prior to Requip but it has side effects as well.

Also the hypersexuality aspect was just  weird because although aroused you can't climax.,Requip does work BUT it's not worth the side effects. I'm going back to low dose neurontin. I am very glad I didn't go up to higher dosing as getting off of Requip would be the pits. Personally ...like many of the posters here...I find that nothing works over the long haul.

I ended up taking a total of 5mg a day_ with food_ and still felt sick and still had breakthrough RLS. A drug rep from the company that makes Requip told me that people taking it for Parkinson's take up to 15mg a day. I can't even imagine how bad I'd feel taking that much!

Like black lightning.    Also_ I get  the strobe light effect in my left eye_ usually in the evenings while watching TV.  I had my eyes checked when I started getting the strobe light effect and the doctor said my retina is fine.  I had leg cramps for a while but found that Co-Enzyme Q10 120 mg daily would take care of that.   Have occasional itching of my feet but hydrocortisone cream seems to work fine.   Also_ I have increased libido which_ at my age_ is fine with me!!  My doctor thinks the increased libido is because I am getting enough sleep now_ but I think it's due to the Requip directly.  When I first started Requip I had blunted orgasms which_after a few months_ were replaced by prolonged_enhanced  orgasms,I'm willing to jump through a lot of hoops to stay on the Requip.I've had RLS  for over 30 years. I still find it hard to believe  that now I'm getting a whole nights sleep_ every night without having to get up and exercise my legs. I sleep like a baby now.  I'm a retired nurse and looked high and low over the years for relief.  I tried benzodiazpines which seemed to work  for a short while.  Beta blockers also seemed to work for a while.  Any time I had to use a narcotic_ like Tylenol #3 _ that would work for a few days.  Nothing worked for very long tho.  I tried the home remedies like Vitamin E_ Folic Acid_ Calcium/Mag.

I take it about 9 pm_ sleep through the night most of the time (up one time to piddle) and wake up fine.  Thought it was a great drug.  Now I have taken it every night for 2 months_ and now I have developed a terrible itch_ all over my body_ from feet to head and scratching it only subsides the itch for a short time.  Nothing else has changed or be added to my diet or medicines.  I normally do not suffer from any allergies so am wondering if it could be the Requip.  The itch is terrible and can be embarrising at times_ but the cramps distrub my sleep so I am of mixed feeling about stopping the Reuip. I will try to cut back or stop the Requip and see if that helps. No one else has mentioned an itch.  I haven't had any other symptom such as those listed so don't know what to make of it.

Being woke up in the middle of the night with the feeling your stomach has just convulsed and tried to push eveything out.  Another is regular nightly sweats which I never had this often. The main reason I started checking for side effects is during the night if I open my eyes in the dark room looking towards the night lighted bathroom_ my vision seems to "" quiver "".  Also I have tended to have ""black lightning"" stripes appear in my vision at times. My starting dosage was .5 mg and then my doctor increased it to 5.0.  The first few times it was like ""what is happening to my body? ""  So I tried easing up the dossage from .5 and splitting the 5.0.

It was severe right from the start_ every single night. Eventually_ it was diagnosed by a doctor who had RLS himself. I was lucky that the doctor had it_ I guess.

I have never been that sick in my life.  I now take 2MG of Requip. 1MG used to work for 2 years and then it stopped working so the dosage was increased.

Because of the nausea/pain after I eat_ I've cut down on what I eat substancially_ and often don't want to eat at all (anorexia can be another side effect).

It got so bad that I'd rather live without the drug.,I've had RLS for 20 years.  It comes and goes with me.  My doc prescriped klonopin for anxiety_ and I soon discovered it was helping my RLS.  I didn't like klonopin because it made me dopey even into the next day.  She suggested requip.  I had no side effects at all and was miraculously cured for a month.  Then the RLS came on like a freight train.  It was so_ so_ so much worse than I had ever experienced.  I went off.  The doc said I was probably taking to high of a dose (1mg) and put me on .25 to start over.  Worked for a week.  Then up to 0.5.  Worked for a while longer.  Then the same thing happend as on the 1 mg dose.  Severe torture.  My husband always called me fidgity_ but now he has move into the guest room.  I'm going off and not touching it again.  What a bummer to know what it is like to be cured only to have it come back in spades!!,F,40,2  months,6/1/2007,Requip
235, 5, RLS,I was having RLS every night and several times during the day before hearing about Requip. I had the pain for several years before I heard about Requip on TV. I talked to my doctor about it. After she researched it_ she started me on the trial pak then on to 1 mg 3 times a day and 3mg at night. My symptoms went away quickly. I had hardly any side effects with the exception of getting drowsy feeling. If I'm busy_ it doesn't bother me at all_ but if I'm idle_ I'll start to yawn like crazy. No problem sleeping at night. Such a relief. I've been on Requip now for about 3 years. My husband says I've quit kicking him and jumping around during the night. Before Requip_ I would be up several times in the night getting on the floor and do the bicycle riding and jumping jacks just to get relief. I don't do any of that anymore unless I forget to take the medication. BUT_ just recently in the last month or so_ I'm having muscle spasms in my legs. It totally catches me off guard.

Even the starter dose_ .5_ felt too much (I almost fell asleep driving after the first night taking it) and I am able to sleep without RLS symptoms using 1/2 of a .5 tablet. I do not take it during the day_ as RLS symptoms seem easier to manage. I have to make the decision whether or not feeling lethargic and spacy is worth not having to fight the maddening symptoms in my arms and legs and getting a good night sleep - even with RLS and about 3 hours of sleep_ I don't think I was this lethargic_ depressed_ etc. before taking Requip.",F,41,1  years,4/29/2007,Requip

I've also been having dreams that are emotionally disturbing_ about long-deceased relatives and so on. I wake up from these dreams feeling sad and depressed. The feelings pass and I go back to sleep_ only to wake up again at some point. I don't feel the urge to move my legs every couple of minutes like before_ but I wake up feeling tired and a bit hungover.

Have gained 10 pounds(and I've never gained weight before) and wondering if it's due to the Requip or the .5mg valium that I take at night. Have now noticed that as soon as I wake up_ I get the restless leg syndrome and can't stay in bed--a very uncomfortable feeling. The jerking is starting to come back slightly_ so the doc says to increase the dosage again. The meds combined make it hard to get moving around in the morning.,Loved requip at first but now beginning to wonder if I should stop it. Don't like the weight gain--if that's the culprit.

After a month or so of taking the 1mg I began to develop rebound symptoms which were worse then the original RLS.  Every afternoon my legs would begin to jump as if I were having a seizure.  I told my doctor and he prescribed an extra .5 (1/2 mg) that I could take around noon the following day if I needed it.  I found if I took just half of the tablet (1/4 of a mg.) that would take care of the rebound without making me sleepy.  I havne't tried it but I think I could take even less to rid myself of the rebound. Perhaps 1/8 of a mg.

I went to my eye doctor today with a complaint of eye fatigue and some slight peripheral vision problems.  Turns out I have nystagmus_ which is a condition marked by uncontrollable eye movements.  With me it is very slight but noticeable_ especially when driving.  Not enough to be dangerous_ but enough where I wouldn't drive for more than 1 hour at a time at this point.

The next morning I had an annoyingly painful headache on the left side behind my eye which was more prominant when I coughed.  The nausea is still there and hopefully the headaches will go away.

It has been three weeks since I took the last pill and the arthritic pain remains extreme.  I am afraid my dopamine level is altered and this will be a permanent condition.

One finger drops toward my palm and only returns to normal position with difficulty. Can hardly flex my right hand at all.,Have had mild RLS for years_ was getting worse lately so my doctor gave me a sample pak that began with .25mg_ then .5mg and finally 1mg.  Some relief from the RLS at night_ but often worse before it got better_ then sometimes had RLS during the daytime_ which I never had before.  By the time I had taken the 12th pill (1mg.) I had constant extreme pain in both hands and the one dropping finger.  About this time I also began to have joint pain in both knees_ one of which was a knee replacement.   Don't know if the Requip is responsible for that or not_ but I am taking no chances.  I stopped taking the pills after 14 days and somehow I will deal with the RLS without them. (I have used quinine pills and tonic water successfully for leg cramps and will try it for RLS). It has been four days since I discontinued Requip and all my pain is still severe...

After these symptoms_ I reduced the dose to .5 mg. It was fairly effective at reducing night leg jerks_ except the occasional more severe one. But since I got too sedated to take in advance_ and took it right before bed_ it took a while to take effect. Sometimes I fell asleep only to wake up to jerks 45 minutes later and could not fall right back to sleep. The thrush did not go away_ even with Diflucan and Nystatin and reduced taste.
