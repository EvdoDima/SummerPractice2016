0, 5, burning in my anus,None,Proctofoam works well.  The anisthetic kicks in rather quickly and takes away any pain.  I have irritable bowel syndrome and  occasionally have a bad bowel movement that makes my anus feel like it's on fire.  Proctofoam helps a great deal_ though I only felt the effects of the anisthetic and not the steriod component.,M,31,10  times,4/13/2006Email,Proctofoam hc
