0, 1, High blood pressure,Coughing uncontrollably,After reading many blogs_ I told my doctor that Lotrel could be the reason I'm coughing. I have been to see a Pulmonologist to see if I had asthma_ did not. Next I'm supposed to see an allergist. If the change of medicine works_ I don't need to go.,F,60,4  months5MG,7/17/2016,Lotrel
1, 3, HBP,Been taking for just a few days when wife asked why I'm huffing and puffing after my brief morning work out. Then today was short of breath after bagging 2 loads of cut grass. Dizzy too.,Reduced BP from 140/90 to 128/88. Not worth side effects. Stopping it today. Will try to post follow-up.,M,55,7  days5/10 1X D,5/22/2016Email,Lotrel
2, 2, To lower my blood pressure,"Frequent peeing in the wee hours of the morning (this makes me alive at work let me tell you). That expression should be ""the pee hours of the morning."" If I completely empty my bladder_ why am I doing the same thing an hour later. Screw that. Weight gain (I never had two chins before). Blurred vision.  Erections not like they used to be and sex drive is blah. A little coughing. Swelled lower calves/ankles. This medicine is not for me.  I am a different person on it.  Time to try a different approach.  When my Dr. told me_ you may have to be on this medicine the rest of your life_ that did not sit well with me. I wanted to pour antifreeze down his mouth and see how he likes it. Most medicines are poisons and are toxic. But the amounts are so low they hopefully won't kill you and perhaps may have a positive effect.","I am very concerned about the long term effects (and_ of course_ the side effects).What good is controlling your blood pressure if Renal Failure is a possibility. That is scary.  I have been taking the generic version Amlodipine Benazepril 5-20 dosage. I started on 5-10_ then my Dr. increased it 'cause it was not working. I should have stopped him right there.  This medicine scares me and though it worked initially_ it no longer works. So why take something that makes you feel like crap and can possibly kill you if there are no benefits. At first I liked this drug_ I thought it was working for me_ but then it stopped and my BP is the same now as when I went on it.  Around 140/90_ sometimes 150/100. I am going to try supplements_ diet_ and exercise.  I guess you can say I tried to take the easy way out.  Well_ that did not work for me and my daily fear of what this medicine is doing to my body is not helping. What really pisses my off is there is not much information on how to properly go off of this medication. I always find this ""Consult your Physician before going off of this Medicine.""  Why_ so he can put me on another drug and keep my body dependent on these horrible drugs. I don't think so. What also bothers me is you have to see your Dr. to get the drug prescription renewed after a while. What kind of money making scheme is this? Sorry_ not me. I go online for advice now_ and I go to the Dr. for regular milestone checkups or if I am sick. I have an accurate BP",M,48,2  years5/20 1X D,7/24/2015Email,Lotrel

4, 4, HBP,Dry nagging tickly cough and no energy,Lotrel lowered my blood pressure to normal. Before Lotrel my blood pressure was spiking to stroke levels and beyond. It has controlled my blood pressure but this nagging cough is ridiculous. The cough developed within a week of taking it. And I have no energy at all.

Insomnia.,When I first went on this medication_ I asked my doctor if there were any side effects I should be concerned about.  He said it was a newer drug_ so there weren't any listed.  Wish I had been better about listening to my body back then.  This stuff is terrible.  My husband was on it for 20 years also.  He developed a terrible cough and pain in his feet and kidney issues.  The doctor prescribed more drugs.  Today_ he's dead.  I will do whatever I can to get off this junk.

Itching and rashes.Respiratory problems Sometimes blurry vision Funny taste in mouth_ indigestion_ nausea  and funny feeling in my chest. Hurts when I cough_ and  tired all the time.,I was on Lotrel 5/10MG for 10 years. First I was taking the Brand name_ and the longer I took it_ I had problems which I_ at the time did not know this medicine was causing this.  Had respiratory problems so bad that I was on steroids for 2/12 years_ causing me to gain a tremendous amount of weight.  Things went from bad to worst when I started taking the generic brand. I took another HP med for a short time and it caused similar side effects_ but my feet were not hurting.  Since I started taking Lotrel again_ my feet are burning and hurting enough to interfere with my walking.  I am opting for a more healthy lifestyle so that I can come off this poison_ as these medicines seem to have similar_ deadly side effects.

9, 2, Due to high blood pressure,I was taking the medicine before bed time. Though it lowered my BP_ it also lowered my HR. It would average around 52-55. It has gone as low as 48. And I am not one of those athletic types with a low HR.My chest felt weird and I was terrified to fall asleep. I wpuld stay up until I could not stay awake any longer.I finally did not take it last night and slept well. I then took my dose in the morning and made me feel so lethargic.

15, 1, HBP,I was an extremely healthy person w/controlled HBP for 3yrs while taking Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25 & Norvasc 5 - until my Ins Co 'Recommended' I switch my Norvasc to Lotrel 'because they were the same drug'_ & that my Norvasc co-pay was going up to $50 & Lotrel would only be $25; & they thru in a coupon for a FREE month. After ~10 days of my Lis/HCTZ 20/25 & my Lotrel 5/40_ I collapsed & nearly died. At the ER my BP was 56/48_ 3hrs later & a BP of 76/58 I was sent home & told I was overmedicated & said I should be fine by the next day. I wish. Each day I started experiencing a different problem_ & now have brain damage w/chronic neuro & endocrine issues. EVERY side effect that people have mentioned here_ & was listed as a rare possible side effect_ I have; & like many others have said_ even after a couple days I kept feeling like the drug was still in me. I haven't been able to work since & am considered permanently disabled. That was,Amazing how much has & is still_ coming out now about Lotrel & its serious side effects. What's more disturbing is the fact that the FDA had previously reprimanded Novartis 3 x's for advertising that Lotrel was a safer alternative to Norvasc & w/very few documented cases of problems; & if you happen to OD_ you'd only experience Hypotension. Have you seen the recent product info? I along w/so many others have unpredictable issues on a daily basis that my Dr's can't  explain. From chronic migraines & nausea; GI vision_ heart_ hormone_ thyroid & endocrine issues; to rt side tremors_ swelling & pain in my feet & extreme fatigue.

It made me so fatigued and lethargic_ I simply did not have the strength/desire for any activity.  My marriage suffered because I was suddenly accused of being lazy_ which I am not.  BUT the drug kept me in such a fatigued state_ I was now a burden on my family. The other side effects like the muscle cramps and urination frequency were issues that I could live with_ but not the fatigue and depression.  I stopped taking LOTREL altogether and I lost 35lbs and my fatigue and depression has ""mysteriously"" vanished.

I have been sent to several other specialists and no one could figure it out. I guess its partly my fault also for trusting a pen happy DR to write more perscription instead of trying to figure out all these symtoms i was getting after perscribing this medicine.although they all didnt come at the same time it has been strecthed out over several years.

Coughing_ muscle aches/weakness_ foot pain with some fluid retention_ EXTREMELY fatigued_ doom like feelings_ and shortness of breath and find it hard to concentrate at work.  I am being worked up for the fatigue and shortness of breath (have asthma under good control) and I bet it is this drug.  I have put a request in to my physician to get off of this drug and haven't heard back from his office yet.  I was put on this medicine off-label for my headaches and they have been better but this drug tends to lower my blood pressure and I already have a low blood pressure.  Symptoms seemed to get worse when it was switched to a generic brand.  Can't wait to get off of it.

30, 3, Hypertension,Increasing fatigue_ profuse sweating_ and concentration problems.,Started on a 10/20 dosage 3 years ago as a replacement for Zestril which my insurance provider would no longer cover (but it worked very well).  Lotrel worked well at first_ then after 2 years my body got used to it and increased to 10/40 dosage.  Noticed obvious increase in sweating_ nocturnal urination_ long and short term memory problems_ dizziness.  Did not notice any ED problems.  Fainted on standing a few months ago_ checked BP (while standing) but it was not abnormally low.  Started checking BP twice a day while still taking 10/40 and it seemed normal (averaging around 120/80).  Left a stressful job a few months ago and thought I'd check BP without taking Lotrel for a few weeks to get a new base reading.  No difference with or without taking Lotrel now.  Time to find something new (if needed_ hopefully not).  It's worth trying to see if it works for you but good idea to monitor its effects at least occasionally and note the common problems people are reporting with it.,M,52,3  years10/40 1X D,12/14/2010,Lotrel

Before getting pregnant_ my BP was always 120/80. After giving birth_ my blood pressure ranged anywhere from 140-180/80-110.

I have no interests but in my bed now. At times i also gets bloating and slight pains in my abdomin when im no where near my monthly. The only reason im giving this medicine a chance is because my mom who has it_ hypertension(although she didnt get it til she was 45)_ was using it and the doctor thought if it works for her maybe it will for me. but she swelled a lot and is now off it and after doing research i found out that it can cause asthenia wich is weakness of muscles and cause tiredness!!! eventhough it brought my hypertension stage 2 (185/117) to 120/90 I am going to ask my doctor for somethn else and this time i wont tell him what my mom is on cause even if it help,It works but it hasnt been properly studied and for a younger age group i think its just all wrong since it can cause asthenia.,F,24,9  months5/10 1X D,11/29/2010,Lotrel

48, 2, high blood pressure,Works great at lowering my blood pressure--side effects not too bothersome at first. Feet and leg pain_ which I attributed to my job as a waitress_ constant coughing_ shortness of breath_ but it gets worse the longer you take it.,Last 6 months_ developed SEVERE lower back/hip pain on left side_ which sometimes spreads across entire lower back...pain so bad_ it sometimes brings me to tears while working. Then about a month ago_ mental depression set in. I'm normally a very happy_ energic_ out-going person. I became withdrawn_ unusually sensitive_ irritable_ lethargic--everything I am not! I missed a couple of doses of this poison 2 weeks ago_ and guess what? I FELT GREAT!!! NO PAIN AT ALL!!! I WAS HAPPY AGAIN!!! I wasn't constantly short of breath_ wasn't coughing_ had energy...just felt like my old self again! Went to Dr. today_ told him how I'd been feeling_ told him how I felt when off the Lotrel. He told me_ no_ he had NEVER heard of Lotrel causing those side-effects-tried to get me to take anti-depressants-I said no! I insisted it had to be the Lotrel. He's sending me for back x-rays (guess he doesn't believe me) and switched me to tenormin 25 at night and norvasc 10 in the morning. Tenormin is a beta blocker (YUK!) and norvasc is one of the poisons in Lotrel! I don't think I'll do any better on these new poisons_ but I have no choice but to try them. I go back in 2 weeks...time will tell. If he can't switch me to something that doesn't cause such debilitating side effects_ I'll just have to find a new Dr.,F,56,3  years10/20 1X D,2/23/2010,Lotrel

Up many times during the night from the coughing. Sometimes insomnia. Started to have leg swelling.,I was happy at first that this drug suppressed my appetite and helped me to lose weight but the benefit of this stopped after a few months with no more additional weight loss and ensuing bad side effects. It DID help with blood pressure_ but not worth the side effects. Didn't know what was wrong with me_ had a bad cold_ then it seemed to get worse plus I have asthma and GERD so thought it was that_ am on Triminterene (sp?) plus the 5-20 generic lotrel_ loved it at first since I lost weight_ helped my BP a lot! Never had it so low_ but after a couple of months_ my life deteriorated and now I was wondering what is wrong with me and how unhappy I am. Not really knowing why. After reading what other people wrote I know that this is the same problem. Stopping it as of today! I want my life back! I was also on Linosipril and it also caused me to cough a lot.

I was in the 120/60 range on the Lotrel .. when I quit it the BP started going up_ sometimes 180/90 or even slightly higher_ which is no big deal to me considering some of the propaganda you read nowadays saying high blood pressure may not be that bad after all .. anyway_ I started getting these_ what I call Ice pick headaches maybe a few time a week & lasting only a second or two_ so decided to go back on Lotrel to see if the headaches subside .. just picked up a prescription today & will update progress in a month or two .. or,M,68,2  years,1/29/2010Email,Lotrel

Had my wife drive me to the emergency room. They run cat scans_ MRI_ blood tests and no one could figure out what was causing the problem. After November the pain moved from my back to my hips and legs. My feet and hands begin to swell which made sleeping very uncomfortable. Doctor could not figure it out.

68, 1, blood pressure,In 06_ I took 3 consecutive rounds of antibiotics which damaged my digestive system and was taking Lotrel 5/10.  I had a debilitating fatigue problem and experienced severe energy drain every 2 -3 hrs which lasted for many months. I had to take 3 more consecutive rounds of antibiotics in 07 and my Lotrel dosage was doubled to 10/20 in Dec.08. The severe energy drain came back_ accompanied by: exhaustion_ an inability to speak normally for 15 months_ urinary track irritation and frequency problem. I felt very parched and lost twice the fluid I could drink.   I asked several drs if a medication could be causing my problems. This suggestion was dismissed even when they didn't even know what some of meds were. I went to www.rxlist.com ( which gives a more extensive med description than does webmd). Found out that you should not be taking an ace inhibitor(in Lotrel) if you do not have edema which I did not. I then suspected that the Lotrel might be causing my problem. My dr took me off L,Be careful if you have to take Lotrel while taking several rounds of antibiotics_ It proved to be a horrible combination for me. I have lost 2 and a half yrs of my life_ lost my teaching job of 34 yrs due to the extreme fatigue and energy drain. Beware that the ace inhibitor in Lotrel caused me to loose my ability to speak normally. I feel anger towards drs that don't take the time to advise you of possible side effects. One dr actually told me to not look at the print outs the pharmacy gives you. Did not want me to look at a Merke Manual. Told me to throw it away. Yet with this GI dr I got pancreatitis from a drug he gave me and intestinal damage from antibiotics. You know your body. You can take the time to become informed about med side effects.

69, 1, HTN,I was put on generic lotrel the last week of Jan 09. At the time I had flu like symptoms_ so when the cough started I believed it was a flu cough that was just persisting. After 4 months I knew I needed help. I went to my PCP and he gave me an Advair inhaler_ thinking it was a flu induced asthma. Needless to say it was no help.I then went to a pulmonologist and he did spirometry and a barium swallow to rule out asthma and reflux. Both negative. He suggested to me there was a chance it was the Ace inhibitor and called my MD to see if he would ok a change. I started on Azor_ which doesn't have the ACE. I have gone through every cough medicine on the market_ so sick of cough drops I could scream.It has been two weeks and I am waiting for a good night sleep and an unembarressing meal in a restaurant. I'm curious what the time frame is for most people to get this poison out of our system.June_3_2009It has been almost a month since I discontinued Lotrel and my cough_ etc has almost dissipated.

Called Cardiologist and had appt with him on 4/9/09 since I have had Bypass surgery. He advised normally it only takes approximately 2 days for the medication to get out of your system. He had me go 4/10/09 for numerous blood tests and I go this week for furthur heart tests.  He is not sure whether this is just the side effects that are continuing or if the side effects have triggered something else to happen with my body.

Have been on Bisoprolol for (only) 2 days now: BP is down to 140/78_ skin is better_ I have more energy_ lethargy and depression are gone.

At my last physical_ my doctor decided I needed to start medication.  I took Mycardis HCT (free samples) for three weeks.  It did not make a difference in my blood pressure_ but I had no side effects.  Then my doctor prescribed Lotrel (10/20).  My pharmacist gave me the generic version.  Within the first day or two_ I developed a massive headache.  It was a strange headache_ like a large clamp grasping the sides of my skull.  Then my joints began to ache_ especially in my back_ hips_ knees and ankles.  My ankles developed painful swelling.  I felt on the verge of tears_ and could not concentrate at work.  When I woke in the morning_ I felt numb and exhausted_ making it difficult to get out of bed.  I felt nauseous all the time.  I felt like I had been poisoned.

I've now been on it for 5 years.  I read the many side effects some people have had and am shocked because I've had none with this drug.

At my physical_ the dr. said my BP was elevated and he once again suggested Lotrel and said to give it more time which I did.  Today will be my last day with this medication because I feel absolutely terrible.  The anxiety_ irritability_ nausea_ cough_ depression and overall tired_ malise feeling will not make up for taking it.  My blood pressure has come down into the 120's/80's range from 140's/90's but is definitely not worth having all these side effects.

Aside from the abovementioned problems_ I am also experiencing anxiety/nervousness_ muscle aches_ a slow pulse_ and sometimes nausea.,I asked the Dr. about side effects of Lotrel and he wants to wait until after the EGD scope.  I just started thinking about possible side effects of my meds and found this site.  Seems a lot of other folks are experiencing the same or similar symptoms I am.  I get the scope tomorrow so we will know shortly if it is a hiatal hernia.  My money is on the side effects though because after thinking back_ these symptoms started around the time I started taking the med but they weren't bad so I really didn't pay much attention to them.  But the symptoms got worse as he upped my dosage.  After this last bad bout_ he wanted to put me on 10/40 but i found some 5/20 that I had saved and started taking it again.  I didn't want to quit it cold turkey but the decreased dosage has caused my symptoms to decrease also.  You do the math.

I refuse to live with all the side effects and potential problems the medication might cause.,One week prior to starting Lotrel_ I was on Coreg_ but my Dr. changed it due to my asthma. There was a bit of fluctuation with the Coreg. Once on Lotrel_ I will admit the BP came down and was steady - in the 110s/80s range. Prior to that_ my BP was in the 150s and 160s.

The side effects came along over a period of 8 years and have devastated my health.  Doctors kept prescribing pills for every side effect not realizing they were caused by Lotrel.

What many blood pressure patients don't understand and I don't care what a doctor tells you_ caffiene raises your blood pressure as well as a poor diet (meaning don't skip meals_ eat at normal intervals).  Also if you have something like chronic back pain_ like myself also adds to your blood pressure.  You mix these with a stressful job and you are sure to get high blood pressure. Unfortunately_ it's the good people who try to do an excellent job and care about their performance who this affects.  If you don't care you don't have anything to worry about and you won't get high blood pressure.,Continue taking_ don't drink anything with caffiene_ exercise_ eat at normal intervals_ do stretching exercises if you have back pain_ talk with your boss and let him know your blood pressure problems.  If he doesn't care go to Human Resources or Safety_ they do.

Some shortness of breath.,I am thankful for this posting site.  It is here that I learned  that the pain I am experiencing is from the Lotrel.

(FEB 2006) It now ranges to about 125/75..give or take. I don't know how I found this site_ but for the last couple of months_ I have been coughing and gagging_ and a few times_ thrown up also.  I had a bad allergy??? attack on the palms of my hands_ bottom of my feet_ and my earlobes only swelled up.  Went back to Dr. and got prednesone and everything cleared up.  Week later_ happened again_ but less severe.  Told me to go see a Dermatologist.  Did that_ more meds. Finally cleared the itching up_ but I am still coughing hacking gagging all the time. And no one seems to know what it is???  WTF do we have doctors for then???  Now Dr. wants me to go see an ALLERGIST..yeah right.  More money...Bullsh!t!  I am going to take myself off the Lotrel_ and find another Dr.,Works great at lowering BP...but at what expense?

Shortness of breath.",The weakness in the shoulders feels like I had been doing push ups or carrying weights around_ and this was just from the weight of my arms.  The empty sensation in my chest made me feel tired at the same time experiencing a heavy sensation_ racing heart_ and flushing sensation that felt like a fever.  These symptoms were exacerbated in the evening just walking around outside_ some 8 hours after taking Lotrel 10/20.   Decrease in sensorum included memory problems_ a feeling of fullness or a band around ones head.  My blood pressure was 182/122 without any symptoms.  My doctor started me on Diovan which brought my blood pressure down to 160/108.  I felt better with the Diovan_ even though it did not lower my blood pressure to our treatment desire.  However_ the Lotrel can only get it down to 150/90 on most days_ but the side effects make me feel really bad_ espically the cough that makes me feel like I have pneumonia or something.

It is the worst drug (Lotrel). I have mild hypertension and blood pressure is elevated mostly at drs. office! Home readings are mostly normal or slightly elevated and I told the dr. this.

All blood work performed on me is super normal.  Im an off season type of bodybuilder_ so maybe its the extra 10 pounds Im carrying?  I have no clue.

My doctor said I had fibromylgia_ but the rheumatologist said I did not have it. I take only two other medicines_ so I started researching them and found out that lotrel can cause muscle pain and tenderness_ I then realized that my symptoms started around the time I was first put on blood pressure medicine.  So I stopped taking lotrel after being on it for two years.  I have been off of it for over three months now and my muscle problems have improved dramatically.

The above rating of,Lotrel did control my BP very quickly.  I've only been taking Lotrel for 6 days and my BP is now around 122/77.  The downside is the side effects.  The cough started on the first day and has continued.  I also feel very listless.  I am normally a high energy person and since taking Lotrel_ I have to push myself to do anything.  I get home from work and just want to lie on the couch.  That is not at all like me.  The cough wakes me up every night and I have gagged so badly from the cough_ that I actually threw up.  I talked to my Dr's nurse and was told to continue taking it.  She said if after a week_ I still have trouble to call.  I'm calling this week.

Please note I have never taken a bp drug before and am very aware of how my body feels_ so these effects might have been my body reacting mildly to the drug.  On day 1 after the first dose I felt my throat feel like it was closing up.  The next day I did not experiance this again.  On day 1 I also had a very mild headache after recieving taking the med. This disappeared.  On day 2 I started to get some heart palpitations that would come and go.  On day 5 I had a increased sensitivity that caused some pain in the underside of my penis. (I did not see this as a side effect_ I doubt people would admit this but I have never had this type of pain before in my life and will say it is coincidental that it occurred when I started taking the med_ This went away the next day. )Because of these effects I decided to stop taking the med.  by bp was 130/96 prior to taking it.
