1, 5, Pain/spasticity associated with MS,I take Darvocet N 100 for pain associated with Multiple Sclerosis.  It reducsed the spasticity and gives me enough pain relief that I can get a good nights sleep,This is the one pain reliever that works for my MS pain.  I have tried Vicodin and Ultram_ both of which gave me the worst headaches I have ever experienced.  I only take it when the pain is bad_ 1-2 x per month.  Darvocet allows me to get a comfortable nights sleep (like I am sleeping on a cloud).  Now that it has been taken off of the market I am left without many options.,F,43,5  yearsN 100 1X AN,8/21/2011Email,Darvocet-n 50

My head felt like it was detached from my body and I couldn't even tell time or control my mouth.,I would never recommend any one to take this drug and was angry when my md prescribed it to me after surgery.

I HAVE TO TAKE 2 OR 3 IN ORDER TO FEEL THE EFFECTS. TAKING ABOUT 2 OR 3 WOULD BE LIKE TAKING A HYDROCODONE 10 OR PERCECET 5.,IM TAKING THE DARVOCET-N 100/625 APAP. THE BAD THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT BY ME TAKING 2 OR 3 AT A TIME AND DOING IT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IS VERY BAD FOR THE LIVER.

8, 4, arthritis pain/migraines,NO side effects when I take just one_ when I take two (and I'm not supposed to) I'll get a little sleepy or loopy. No nightmares_ no hallucinations_ no stomach pain. But you have to realize I'm used to MUCH stronger stuff.,"I started taking this for arthritis in my hands_ my doctor gave it to me when I complained the pain was keeping me awake. It does not help with the arthritis.One day when I ran out of my other migraine medication (and I have been on all SORTS of stuff for that_ some worked_ some didn't and SOME had worse side effects than the migraines) I took darvocet_ and was surprised it worked. I will take it when my migraines are mild (or at onset)_ and occassionally to combat a tough one I will take two_ and USUALLY that is good enough_ but it takes longer than other medicines to ""kick in.""",F,31,2  years 1X AN,9/20/2010,Darvocet-n 50

10, 3, Menstrual Cramps,Nausea if not taken with food.,"I actually was prescribed Davorcet-N 100 for menstrual cramps. The dosage was 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed. One pill did nothing for me. When I take two_ they take about an hour to work on the pain. (They wear off in about two to three hours_ depending on the severity of the pain. I'm actually considering asking my doctor for something stronger.) I have not experienced any type of ""euphoria_"" drowsiness_ or feelings of relaxation with this drug alone. When my cramps are really bad_ I take two Davocet-N 100's and two .25mg Xanax so that I can relax and take my mind off the pain. For moderate to severe pain_ I wouldn't recommend this drug. For mild pain_ I think it would work just fine.",F,31,8  weeks100 2X AN,8/10/2010,Darvocet-n 50

I went online and read the fourms-sure enough_ darvo works for some and viko does nothing_ and visa versa for others. I am alcoholic (sober 10 yrs) and I'm glad I was on darvo only 1 week cause it makes you feel good. I do recall a nightmare went I took 2 darvo one nite only for a tooth extraction a few years back_ but overall it's been very good to me.

14, 5, Tension Migraine Headaches,Mild pleasant feeling about 1 out of 10 times_ otherwise no side effects.,"Actually works better for my tension migraines than a number of  stronger meds including percocet_ oxicontin_ and toradol. Does not relieve muscular pain or low level aches.  Over the years I've found it effective for ""acute"" sharp pain caused by migraine/earache/toothache while useless on chronic or muscle pains.  Contains a truly stupid amount of unnecessary acetaminophen.",F,53,17  yearsN-100 2X AN,3/28/2010,Darvocet-n 50
15, 5, SI joint pain,Euphoria. I seem to never stop talking when I take this med. Which is fine with me but probably bores my friends. No other side effects.,I have N-100 but split the pulls since it has too great of an effect ( not saying this equals n-50). In general i hate any type of pain med but this one works nicely. It gets rid of my pain related to sacroiliitis. I experiance no insomnia and in fact take just before bed_ possibly gives me more vivid dreams but not nightmares.

16, 1, Post op pain,Useless for pain_ grogginess/ foggy head_ nausea,Not as effective as TRAMADOL for pain. Very narrow theraputic index_ take 1 it does nothing_ take 3 end up not breathing. Each pill has a whopping 650mg of Tylenol in it. Thats probably the reason it works as well as it does. Yeah_ it's a miracle drug all right.,M,27,2  days100mg 4X D,2/11/2010,Darvocet-n 50

21, 5, Migraine_ Shoulder Injury,Dry mouth_ slight dizziness_ mild euphoria. No other side-effects.,Darvocet works better for me than any other pain medication. It's not too strong_ but just strong enough to knock out any pain I might be having for at least 8-10 hours. I get a little bit loopy_ and a little bit euphoric_ but that is generally short lived. I also don't get rebound headaches from it_ like I do with Ultracet. I'm still able to function_ drive_ and work with no problem unlike stronger pain medications like Norco. For moderate pain_ I'd recommend it. It's just enough to take the edge off.,F,32,4  months,7/11/2009Email,Darvocet-n 50
22, 3, laparoscopy,relaxed,My pain is minimal to begin with_ but I did feel like this drug took the edge off.  It definitely didn't make me feel numb all over like Vicodin (which also makes me violently dizzy_ nauseous_ and sometimes causes panic attacks) but I was relaxed and glad there were no bad side-effects. I probably could've gotten the same level of pain relief from a few ibuprofin.,F,24,2  days,4/10/2009,Darvocet-n 50

I proceeded to take the prescribed dosage every four hours and finally had a little pain relief.  I was still in a lot of pain but managed to doze off. I was awakened because I COULD NOT BREATHE!!!  My heat slowed down so much that I had to get up and walk around.  I was sure I was dying and thought I would need to call an ambulance.  This went on for about 4 hours.  I had to lean forward and cough at times just to get my heart rate up. Whenever I panicked_ my pulse raced and my heart struggled to beat.  It was the worst experience of my life.

I personally think the Ultracet worked better for my pain! This darvocet does NOTHING_ I still feel pain - infact sometimes it feels like its intensifying the pain. I was taking 3 ultracet_ but with this I have to take 4 darvocet to feel any relief. Going to ask for a different medication monday.... this stuff DOESNT WORK.,F,24,4  days,12/21/2008,Darvocet-n 50

36, 3, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,insomnia_ shaky_ weakness_ hot flashes_ little nausea_ felt groggy_ depression,It's 3:19 am and I had taken a Darvocet an hour ago for my pain then tried to go back to sleep. However_ about an hour later I couldn't sleep and I started to shake for the first time with some nausea which made me do some online researching. I would of rather taken a tylenol pm than this because it gave me insomnia the whole week and just now figured it was from this pill. After reading the other comments_ me being depressed the last 2 days severely makes sense. I am not a depressed person_ but I found myself sitting in my room by myself with the lights off watching tv all day today refusing to join my friends who live with me. I was prescribed this since vicodin makes me sick... but this isn't worth taking because of the side effects.

38, 5, Lumpectomy/node dissection,None,My surgeon wanted to prescribe Vicodin_ but I told her that it doesn't relieve pain for me and makes me feel wired so she prescribed Darvocet-N 100 instead.  It got rid of the pain without making me feel different in any way.  I was amazed and relieved that I didn't have to deal with side effects to get pain relief.,F,45,3  weeks,7/8/2008,Darvocet-n 50

I never use it during the day_ due to the slight sedating effect. It seems to work better than most painkillers I have tried for my chronic back problems. Unless I am really hurting a lot_ I will take only one pill per night; otherwise_ it will sedate me too much_ and I won't want to wake up early the next day. Still_ even on the rare occasions that I have taken two of these_ they didn't cause me as much grogginess as one Tylenol PM would!,F,54,14  months,4/19/2008,Darvocet-n 50

I was beginning to become depressed when the thought occured to me this feeling might be side effects.  I switched to ibuprophen that day and within a day all sadness-crying ceased.  Now I know why my father becomes depressed and cries alot for no reason. His Dr took him off NSAIDS for his arthritis and put him on Darvocet 100.

It had metastasized extensively_ so surgery lasted for several hours (their goal was to remove as much of it as they could without keeping me under for too long).  I was given Vicodin ES post-op_ and then given a prescription for Darvocet-N 100 (I-II p.o. PRN 4-6 hrs.) upon discharge.  Surgery was 3 days ago_ and I used the Darvocet-N 100 exactly 2x before throwing it away.  My PCP prescribed regular Vicodin (5/500) (I p.o. TID) this morning_ and just the ONE 5/500 Vicodin works better to lessen (not exactly relieve_ but lessen_ which I *am* grateful for) my post-op pain.  When I phoned the surgeon to explain that the Darvocet had not helped_ I was told to take OTC Tylenol (after them cutting away at a major area of my neck and a 5"" incision)!

65, 1, broken hand,Slight depression_ aggrivation because it does NOTHING for pain.,Seriously nothing makes me more mad than this drug. Doctors these days constantly give you this when you have pain that is far beyond its potential to cure. Sure it probably helps a stubbed toe_ but anything beyond that this stuff is as worthless as a placebo pill.

I was very happy and never had any serious depressive ideations prior to taking Darvocet(not sure if it was 50 or 100 though.) I was miserable and threw out the rest of the prescription after about 2 weeks because I knew it was causing my negative state of mind.  I was so depressed and so unlike my ""real"" self that my reaction to Darvocet ultimately led to the demise of the 2 year relationship I had been in! I am convinced this would have never occured had I not been taking Darvocet. My sister got her teeth out the same time as I did and she was on Darvocet as well.

77, 1, back pain,I remember taking this stuff about 30 years ago and thought it was garbage. But I was out of the Lortab and offered the Darvocet 100_ it was just like I remembered made me a little lightheaded_ a little sick to my stomach_ and highly depressed_ (by the way genaric vicodin makes me depressed very quickly). Anyway I took the Darvocet for almost a week before I realized how much it was to blame for the negative effects. Never again they ought to take that stuff off he market.,,M,50,7  days,12/30/2006,Darvocet-n 50
78, 5, Migraine,No side effects other than pain relief.,I've found that Darvocet works much better than Vicodin_ Percocet_ toradal injectin_ or even oxycontin (yes_ I had a Dr. prescribe a couple once) for tension migraines and certain other acute pain. Although some studies consider Darvocet to be no better than placebo_ there is considerable empirical evidence indicating considerable benefit. In my own long term as-needed use I have found that pain relief from Darvocet is limited to specific types of acute pain. For example_ doing little or nothing for muscle strain or chronic low-grade body aches while providing complete relief for acute pain (migraine_ ear-ache_ menstrual cramps).After 20 years of trying many Dr. suggested alternatives it is still the only med that completely removes my migraine headache.,F,50,23  years,12/24/2006,Darvocet-n 50

80, 2, ovarian cyst pain/dysmenorrhea,I got dizziness and nausea_ drowsiness_ and a feeling of relaxation.  The normal dose is about 100 mgs_ though I had to take almost twice that to get any analgesic benefit.  Also had to take dramamine with it to prevent severe nausea every time.    It's also WAY too slow-acting when you're sitting there in pain waiting/hoping for it to work.   And you have to take it several times before you get any pain relief at all!,Propoxyphene is not good for pain control.   It knocked out maybe 20% of my pain_ and made me drowsy_ lightheaded_ and a bit loopy. I ordered this drug online as it is Schedule IV and pretty available_ and for good reason:  It doesn't work.       Worth taking for placebo_ I guess_ or to treat the stress and anxiety that result from not having access to a more effective pain med.  However_ it is loaded with acetaminophen_ so watch out.    This is what you are stuck with if hydrocodone makes you sick_ or if your doctor refuses to treat your pain properly with a better med.       This drug is like alcohol_ having little medical application and so limited value beyond abuse.   A few shots of vodka will have more effect and probably be easier on your liver!     Bottom line this has all the hazards of an OTC NSAID and is no more potent_ but is still addictive and will produce withdrawl.I would advise to avoid unless you literally have nothing else to take.,F,29,14  days,10/24/2006,Darvocet-n 50

One time he gave me Vicodin and that took away the pain and I could walk upright again. I tried for 2 weeks with the Darvocet to give it time_ like my Dr told me to. Still Nothing!
