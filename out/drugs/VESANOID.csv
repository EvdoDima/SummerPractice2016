0, 5, APL Leukemia,None at first_ but severe headaches over time. Dizziness and blurred visions. On a positive note_ it made my skin texture amazing. Smooth_ even_ glowing. Strangers would comment on it.,"I was taking this drug in the pill form to treat my Leukemia (APL) between 2008 and 2010. I was on it off and on for about 18 months in addition to traditional chemo. I am in remission and have been for a few years. In the beginning_ when my cancer was progressing agressively_ this pill did not have any side effects for me and appeared to be working as intended. Once I went into remission and no signs of cancer remained_ I continued taking it per my oncologist to stay in remisison as ""maintainence"". It was then that I began to experience really bad side effects of the headaches_ dizziness and blurred vision_ to the point where I could hardly function normally and driving was dangerous. It was rough_ but went away completely a few days after I finished my dose. As mentioned_ it did improve my skin considerably and I looked 10 years younger but that stopped when I went off the drug as well. Overall_ of course I'm satisfied_ as now I'm cancer free!",F,30,18  months 2X D,10/23/2011,Vesanoid
