0, 5, Migraines,Achy joints_ fatigue_ sometimes an upset stomach,If I take at the onset of a migraine it usually subsides within 30 minutes,F,46,6  years 1X AN,8/2/2016,Zomig
1, 5, Migraine,GENERIC ZOMIG DOES NOT WORK,Get the BRANDED ZOMIG ONLY,,,5  years,7/17/2016,Zomig
2, 5, Chronic Migraines,Frequent urination_ facial numbness.,Within 45 minutes_ my headache is greatly reduced.  I've tried the generic Sumitriptan and it doesn't work nearly as effectively.  It can take a headache that is causing vomiting and severe pain down to an annoyance at worst.  The facial pain is somewhat of a relief as I've had chronic facial pain for the past 2.5 years_ so any relief is great_ but it does concern me as I would hate for that to become permanent.,M,41,30  days5mg 1X D,4/11/2016,Zomig
3, 4, Migraines,The migraine is gone within 45 minutes after taking zomig but then the side effects are crazy. I can't hold my head up_ my throat swells were its impossible to swallow anything_ I'm dizzy_ my stomach is very upset and my skin feels like its burning,I've been prescribed so many different prescriptions but the zomig is by far the only migraine medication that give me some relief_ the side effects i can really do without,F,49,4  years5mg,3/18/2016Email,Zomig
4, 5, Migraines,Difficulty swallowing.,No trouble except swallowing_ which is a concern. I no longer take it but I have permanent constriction in my throat from taking it over time. (However_ I only took 2.5 mg at a time_ cutting it in half because I only received 9 a month)_ I still suffered a lot of pain in head_ neck_ shoulders_ face that was excruciating when I didn't have any left to take of my monthly prescription. The zomig relieved the pain quickly when I took it_ however. But now I'm left with problems swallowing which other over the counter drugs also create_ to a lessor degree. Upon taking zomig I'd feel my arms becoming heavy as if whatever pain in my head was relaxing my body as the pain depleted. I was glad to have this medication because the pain was so bad. Of course now I realize I have histamine intolerance so it's like foods with histamine a built up in my system causing this but it was confusing because one day a certain food didn't bother me and another it did. I didn't know then about histamine intolerance however. I still have it and I have to be careful what I eat and vary my diet. ,F,67,10  years5,2/25/2016Email,Zomig
5, 5, Migraines,Sleepiness_ skin is extremely sensitive to warm/hot water_  occasional nausea,This stuff is great.  I tried everything over-the-counter and nothing worked.  Relieves my headaches completely within 30 minutes.  My doctor prescribed the 5 mg tablet but I cut them in half to lessen the nausea side effect.,F,37,4  years2.5 1X W,10/13/2015,Zomig
6, 3, Hemiplegic Migraine,Tingling in the back of my head. Tightness in my neck and pain from neck to my right eye. Extreme nausea. Drunk-like feeling. Loss of coordination.,This took action within 2 hours_ the side effects kicked in after 45mins - 1hr. I felt awful. Could not hold my head up_ had to keep tilting it to find some relief. Nearly threw up from nausea. Felt like I was in some weird drunken stupor and could not walk straight. Migraine subsided substantially though after about 1.5hrs. I found that this was not supposed to be prescribed for hemiplegics so perhaps this was the issue along with my doctor who prescribed me this medication. I would sincerely advise anyone thinking of taking this medicine to try an alternative first if possible.,F,23,1  days2.5mg 1X D,9/11/2015,Zomig
7, 4, Migraines,No side effects that I've noticed.,I've suffered with chronic migraines since I was 13. I'm now 27 and have seen countless doctors and neurologists and tried countless medications. Zomig is the first and only drug to even touch my migraines. Zomig doesn't completely stop my migraines but it brings it from a level 10 (where I'm vomiting or fainting)_ down to a level 6. It's still very painful and I have to remain lying in bed_ in the dark_ but it's not bad enough to make me vomit. Zomig is amazing but I wish I could get more than 6 pills at once.,F,27,4  years2.5 mg,8/17/2015,Zomig
8, 5, Migraines,Tingling burning sensation on the back of the head muscle aches and pains in the joints especially in feet tightness in the neck and chest and down both arms hypersensitive to warm water sometimes sleepy when eating within two hours of taking medication it's almost like eating something sour kind of things in the back of your jaw,I have suffered from migraine since I was 13 years old this is the only medication I have ever taken that will take the headache away mine typically used to last 6 to 12 hours no matter what I would take now I take Zomig 5 milligram tablets and it's gone usually within the hour I do have some side effects but I have found eating something for example a half of a peanut butter sandwich no matter how nauseated I am can help with the side effects also naproxen or an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen seems to help with the side effects as well I read many side effects on this feed and yes they are scary but the medication does work for me the side effects are still there so if I can eat something small like a sandwich take the medication and lie down for an hour I'm a hundred percent better when I get up I highly recommend this medication for severe migraine sufferers,F,47,3  years5 MG tab,8/16/2015Email,Zomig
9, 5, headaches,Major fatigue.  Frequent urination and feels like I have a sunburn all over if I shower within a few hours of taking it.,Can't live without it!

11, 4, Frequent Migraines,Sore throat_ achy jaw_ dry mouth_ extreme fatigue,This medicine is amazing if you take it right when you have the smallest headache. If you wait for a bad headache or migraine it is useless. Take it even if you do not know if the small headache will develop further. Can take a second dose 2 hours later if needed.,F,29,5  years 2X AN,4/25/2015,Zomig
12, 3, Chronic Daily Migraine,Head pain got less severe within an hour of taking but second dose was needed. I felt very strange. My eyelid crumpled up. I was very tired but found it hard to fall asleep. I had some crazy dreams and woke several times during the night. My throat felt tight and I experienced a heavy chest. This morning I'm exhausted and ache all over. I'm feeling very forgetful.,I took this medication an hour before I went to bed. It was prescribed as I am sensitive to sumitriptan. I still have a nagging head pain this morning but I'm glad the migraine went last night!,F,29,1  days2.5/5,1/29/2015Email,Zomig
13, 4, Migraine,Feel disoriented_ hard to concentrate_ a little dizzy_ sleepy_ frequent urination_ heightened senses - taste touch hearing.,Side effects have got worse the longer I take it. I'm pretty much incapacitated for most of the day_ can 't drive until about 9 hours after use. Still much better than a migraine as it does relieve all of my symptoms most of the time and always helps considerably.,F,67,12  years2.5 mg 1X AN,1/3/2015Email,Zomig
14, 4, Cluster headache / migraine,Chest tightening. Sore throat and irritation from nasal spray. Hyperaesthesia on scalp. Mild fatigue. Mild nausea. Slight euphoria several hours after dose,I tolerate this far better than sumatriptan which sends my blood pressure through the roof and I get out of breath. Zomig even at the 5mg level is fairly well tolerated. Nasal spray starts to take effect in around 10 mins. By 30 mins_ the pain is all gone.,M,34,6  times5mg 1X AN,12/11/2014,Zomig
15, 4, Severe migraines,I have always been sensitive to medications and have side effects. Zomig is the best I've tried and I have tried A LOT. Migraine lessens after 30 minutes_ disappears in an hour. I get extremely sensitive skin (hurts to touch scalp_ brush hair_ body feels over sensational) my throat tightens and I get a burning in my neck. Not altogether unpleasant. It does make me sleepy and feel like not moving whatsoever.,Overall very happy with this. When none of my medications work_ this makes it all better.,F,17,2  months,11/5/2014,Zomig
16, 5, Migraines,Has been a lifesaver.  Pain stops within 30 mins of taking.  I've had migraines daily now for over a week and worried about rebound headaches.  One thing I do notice is a feeling of tingling in my arms and sinus drainage with sneezing.  Is this normal with drug?? Doing more research and what the long term affects are.,,F,45,1  days5mg,10/11/2014,Zomig

22, 3, for migraine,Very few side effects_ slight tingling in arms_ neck and nasal passages.,this drug has always been so very effective in relieving my migraines which I used to get once or twice a week.  Zomig usually worked within the hour and that was on only half a tablet ie 1.25mg.My problem however is now medication overuse or rebound headaches.  I suffer migraines or headaches now on between 18 and 24 days a month now and the only thing that shifts them is yet another dose of Zomig.  It is ruining my life.  I wake up every morning with a bad head_ a stiff neck_ aching arms.  The headaches vary from one sided migraine headache to a dreadful pain in the top of my head or even in my face or back of my head.  Even after taking the zomig_ I don't now feel well until after lunch. I was never warned about medication overuse in the first place or else I would never have let my dosage creep up and up.  I don't feel the drug companies or GP's do enough to warn people about this.,F,62,12  years2.5gg 1X AN,3/4/2013Email,Zomig
23, 5, Frequent migraines,No side effects here.  Actually makes me feel so great!,Zomig has been a lifesaver for me.  I used to take Relpax_ which was also great_ but insurance all of a sudden refused to cover it.  Tried Imitrex and didn't work and had horrible side effects.  Zomig takes the migraine away in about 30 minutes and I feel great afterward.   I wish it would go generic_ because it's very expensive and my insurance limits the quanity.,F,46,2  years5mg 2X W,12/20/2012,Zomig

The spray version starts to help me within 30 min. whereas the tablet took up to two hours to offer relief. I try to use other medicines.

33, 5, Acute frequent migraines,Occasional dizziness,This medication has been a life saver for me! I have had acute migraines for 33 years_ I could be down and out for several days_ vomiting_ nausea_ intense pain.  Suffering approximately 12 -15 attacks per month.  When I take Zomig_ the migraine is gone within 30 minutes and I usually only need to take one 2.5mg pill.  It's fantastic_ I don't need water to swallow it_ so it can be taken anytime anywhere.  I no longer need to take codeine products which only slightly minimized the severity and no more gravol to keep down the nausea.  I had tried imitrex_ which gave me severe stomach cramps_ which also kept me out of commission (hard to say which was worse_ the cramps or the migraine).  Zomig has given me the freedom to make plans and keep them.  I have an active life again and only wish this had been available years ago.,F,45,10  months2.5 1X D,10/21/2011Email,Zomig
34, 5, Migraines_ 1-2 a month,Sore joints_ sensitivity in extremities and skin_ cold nose_ over-stimulated salivary glands_ sore scalp_ and feelings of drowsiness that eventually pass.,I started getting migraines about 10 years ago when my kids were toddlers. The migraines usually occur during my period every month_ sometimes twice_ and usually with 1 or 2 days of bounce backs. I was originally prescribed Imitrex (nasal_ 20mg)_ and the side effects were so painful_ I would cry trying to decide which was worse -- the migraine or the cure. I was switched to Zomig_ which was an immediate relief. I usually will take 1/2 5mg pill at onset and if I can sleep for a little while_ am all set. If I don't catch it on time_ I have to take a whole pill. Zomig truly did give me days and days of my life back_ and I'm grateful. The last year_ though_ I am finding that I have an alarming loss of memory; I can't remember something I did_ or where I was heading_ or who I was with... It is scaring me enough that I think I will give up the pill entirely (the only medication I take) and treat any migraines with OTC meds and sleep.,F,42,4  years5MG 1X D,10/6/2011Email,Zomig

My throat started to constrict and my vision went black I was exceedingly dizzy and tired and was unable to breathe properly.

My side effects are minimal_ a little tightness in the neck / throat and some yawning_ slight tiredness. It relieves EVERYTHING - headache pain_ light sensitivity_ aura_ sound sensitivity and nausea! Such a blessing!,"I am having more and more difficulty getting a prescription for this from my family doctor. Insurance now only covers ""4 headaches a month"" and of course you have to keep your cholesterol low to be allowed to continue with the prescription but this medicine has kept me functional and happy for the last 11 years. Such a blessing!

Severe head and neck pain  vomiting_ dark quiet room etc. Or  I would just have a dull ache for days which made concentrating difficult. Thankfully my doctor prescribed triptan meds. If I take a Zomig early in the attack the pain is usually gone within two hours or less.  I have up to 4 migraine headaches a week and they will just appear from nowhere so I take the Zomig rapimelt.

I used to get a couple a year when I was in my early teens which have escalated frequency wise over the years. I was prescribed zomig about 5 years ago by a Consultant. I found them to be fantastic and cured me with no side effects within an hour. Since taking them however my migraines have become more and more frequent to the degree that I now wake up at 5.30am every morning to take a zomig so that I can get up a few hours later. I have taken a zomig every day now for about two years. I believe that I am now adicted to them and that it is the zomig that is now causing the migraines. I try periodically to go cold turkey but I can have a debilitaitng migraine for up to 4 or 5 days and eventually I give in and take a zomig and I am back to normal within an hour again. They are fantastic but please be careful that you don't become addicted.

50, 5, Three day migraines every fortnight,Awful zombie-like feeling after taking. Drowsy_ nauseous and the pain intensified temporarily. Operated in a dream-like state for hours afterwards.,I wanted to kiss the person responsible for this drug. I got my life back after suffering three day migraines for over twenty five years. Other drugs didn't touch it. They just made me feel even more sick. I couldn't believe there was a drug which aborted the migraine. Wonder drug! The side effects weren't pleasant_ but were a breeze compared to frequently spending three days in a darkened room_ suffering intense throbbing pain_ dizziness and nausea. True suffering. I wanted to die or bang my head against something hard to stop the pain. (Oh migraine is SO NOT like a mere headache!I get cross that non-migraine sufferers say they have migraine yet still function normally! They have no idea.....)However_ I must warn against the side effects. I took Zomig regularly...on average about one a week_ at the onset of a migraine. In 2003 I suffered a heart attack. Not sure if it was severe angina or a full blown heart -attack. I now have a stent in my heart after having an angioplasty. On my records the doctor states there was no real reason for my heart troubles. I was fit and not overweight. It came out of the blue. Zomig is contra-indicated for those with heart problems_ so to my dismay I was taken off it. (I felt like an addict being deprived her drugs!) However_ I had to take antenolol_ a beta-blocker as a matter of course after my heart incident. (I also have to take a small dose of asprin and a statin.) Guess what? No more migraines. I have been told the beta-blocker is the key.,F,56,7  years5mg 1X AN,12/15/2010,Zomig
51, 5, Chronic Migraines,My side effects:  Enhanced sense of taste_ temporary light sleepiness (but can go easily without having to lay down). Here's a weird one: Memory Loss  Also_ I'm not sure if this is directly related to Zomig_ but recently I had twitching in my eye lids.,I continuously research medical advances on migraines. There is NOTHING out there that will prevent them. I tried not drinking wine_ not eating cheeses_ stuff with nitrates etc. I've taken all sorts of prophylactics that were prescribed. It's all BS. If you have migraines go ahead and enjoy your wine. Not drinking it doesn't change anything.  Zomig WORKS but it's a reactive remedy.  I don't know about other triptans_ because I've never taken them. My migraines started when I was about 16 yrs old and became more severe at age 25 when I had my daughter.  They became so overpowering that I could not get out of bed for 3 days at a time. Since my neuro started me on Zomig_ I can function and live a normal life. My dose is 5MG_ but I divide it into 3 parts and 1/3 of the pill normally takes care of everything: migraine_ nausea_ energy loss. The only thing it doesn't take care of is my cold hands and cold feet_ which now I know are related to migraines. I have also found that Zomig takes care of my headaches (Note: Headaches are NOT Migraines). I'm a little worried about my memory loss. Sometimes I will ask my family the same question two or three times in a row without remembering it. They point this out to me and it's a little weird. I'm only 36. I also finished my MBA recently and I found remembering concepts substantially more difficult. I usually had to contribute about 3x more work than my counterparts.

53, 4, Migraines,The most annoying side effect has been frequent urination.  Zomig also makes me quite sleepy.,I have found that Zomig works quite well on my migraines_ but it does leave me quite tired_ to the point where it really is difficult keeping my eyes open.  Also_ the frequent urination is annoying because when I have a migraine_ I want to lay down and sleep_ but having to urinate every 15 minutes (urgently) gets in the way of this.  I have found this to be true for other migraine medications I've tried.  I'm going to keep up with the Zomig for a while longer to see if it really is the right medication for me.  I also find that after taking it I feel like I'm a bit spacey...like in a bit of a dream-state.

One morning before work I took 5 mg and had to do a lot of getting up and down and had some light headedness; especially when lowering my head to look under cabinets and then standing up.  1st time ever (I also had taken 800 mg of ibuprofen because I had a sore bad-don't know if one had anything to do with the other-so I now refrain from mixing the two.),My dad suffered from migraines his whole life and sadly never really got any relief.  The first time I took Zomig and my headache floated away I though it was a miracle.  It has never failed me...never.  Unfortunately I have not been able to afford insurance for many years and it is a difficult a least to keep a stash on hand.  I HAVE to have it when I get a migraine as nothing else will help.  Be careful buying them from Canada_ the Chinese make imitations that only the real migraine sufferer with know are fake...God bless Doctors that get samples and the barter system.

59, 5, Chronic Migraines,sleepy_ lethargic_ grateful,Zomig has been my savior having had chronic migraines daily for 34 yrs.  The debilitating migraines require the full 5mg ZMT_ the others I can usually manage with the 2.5mg.  My biggest problem is getting my insurance company to pay for the meds.  Now that Imitrex has made a generic_ my doctor will no longer receive Zomig samples which really helped offset the small amount the insurance company allows.  I live on the Mexico border and Zomig is no less expensive there and difficult to find.  Lately I've been taking a 25mg Phenergan (generic) and 1 (one) Skelaxin (now generic) that seems to help at times when I am running low on Zomig.  I take Fioricet also if the headache is really painful_ but Fioricet like so many pain meds causes  rebound HA's.  I no longer take any OTC meds for the same reason.  I also am affected by weather (low barometric pressure)_ dairy_ peanuts/peanut oil_ bananas_ msg_ nitrates_ yeast_ not enough sleep_ too much sleep_ stress_ et._al.  My doctor absolutely forbids Niacin.  It causes severe migraines.  I can't take B vitamins_ Vitamin E_ too many anything with antioxidants as it opens the blood vessels_ causing better blood flow to the brain_ which is good for most people_ but for me causes migraines.,F,61,10  years5 mg ZMT 1X D,7/22/2010Email,Zomig

The self-dissolving tablets I just started using a couple of months ago. They take longer to work_ but don't taste as bad. I still use both. However_ Triptans should only be used a max of 2x per week because of the risk of heart problems. I take both with a little food and ginger ale or sprite to calm my stomach.

66, 5, migraines,My impression has been that Zomig eliminates the head pain and nausea but doesn't get rid of some of the other migraine related sensations like skin sensitivity and mild aura.  These sensations could_ of course_ be side effects to Zomig which I am misidentifying as migraine sensations not eliminated by Zomig.,I go through bouts of migraines_ sometimes every day_ sometimes only 1 per month.  My theory du jour is that they are largely triggered by atmospheric pressure.  A 2.5mg dose of Zomig generally takes care of the head pain in about 2 hours_ however I still know I have a migraine.  Zomig has significantly improved my life. The main problem now is that I feel like an addict.  When my supply of Zomig is low I get really anxious and my doctor always makes me feel guilty for wanting a renewal of the prescription.

About three months ago_ I had been suffering with a migraine for over two weeks. The pain was so bad I was willing to try anything. My neurologist gave me samples of Zomig (Imitrex side effects were so bad). I was afraid to try the Zomig as I thought it would have the same side effects as the Imitrex. I was wrong. I did have the neck and jaw tightening but nothing like I did with the Imitrex. I finally got some relief with the Zomig. It took three 5 mg tablets but it was a life saver. I am so thankful to have it. For the pain relief Zomig gives_ I will gladly deal with the side effects. It does work more effectively if you take it before a full blown migraine attack.

At first_ I had to lie down to allow the medication to work_ and it still does work faster if I can do that. However_ I do not always have that luxury.

In fact I ended up getting an ulcer from all of the over the counter medication I took to try and relieve my pain. Nothing worked until I started to take this medicine. This drug is a life saver_ I don't know what I would do without it!The side effects are no picnic_ but not taking this medicine or not being able to take it has had me in the hospital a few times. I become so sick vomiting that I cannot keep anything down including medicine. At that point I have to have drugs intravenously to stop the vomitting and pain. So I will take a few annoying side effects over the emergency room any day!This drug is a life saver_ I don't know what I would do without it!,F,25,2  years,1/8/2009,Zomig

My headaches were so intense that at times I wish I were dead then having to endure that pain for 3 straight days.  Zomig was an absolute life saver!

108, 5, Migraines,I usually don't experience any side effects with a 5 mg dose_ however_ one time I became desperate to thwart off a headache before going to work and took 10 mg (because the aura kept getting worse)_ and I experienced tightness in my neck_ chest and jaw. For a couple hours after taking the 10 mg dose_ my mouth and saliva glands felt puckery and I had a sore throat when drinking and/or eating. I've never had those side effects before after taking only 5 mg. But the bottom line is it kept the headache away.,I LOVE Zomig!!! I had taken Cafergot for years_ but then it was discontinued. Imitrex does nothing for me. My doctor_ who has migraines too_ prescribed Zomig back in 1999 because it worked for him. Zomig has given me my life back. There has only been a handful of times when it hasn't worked_ and that's only because I couldn't get to my medicine quick enough. For it to be the most effective_ take it as soon as you see the first hint of an aura.,F,42,9  years,11/3/2008,Zomig

My whole body felt like I wasn't in it.,After about and hour the side effects subsided_ and I was fast asleep.

113, 5, Severe Migraines,When I take Zomig_ I experience an extreme tightness in the neck and jaws_ almost like a vise-grip being tightened around the back of my neck.  I also experience a slightly metallic taste and temporary sore throat.  However_ once the vise-grip sensation occurs and reaches its peak (usually after 20 minutes)_ the headache and vise-grip sensation subside_ leaving me a little drowsy_ but without pain_ typically an hour from that point I am fully functioning again with a slight tightness in my throat and a slight metallic taste.  Also_ I find after taking Zomig_ that night I sleep like a baby.  The biggest un-pleasantry I experience is lukewarm to warm water feels really hot.  The medicinal effects last at least 48 hours for me.,Originally_ my insurance would only cover 3 pills per month.  I found out that you can have your Doctor contact your pharma insurance and overwrite their limits.  Now I get 12 pills per month_ and even though I don't use them all_ I still fill it every month_ just in case.  Originally Doctors tried to put me on a prophylactic/preventative drug where I would have to take one pill each day.  Then I found a different Doctor who could not figure out why other Doctors insisted on giving me one pill a day to prevent migraines when I dont get migraines every day and I could just take a single pill whenever I get one_ (maybe 1X every 3 weeks) that would guarantee relief for me within 30 minutes.  If your Dr has not discussed Zomig with you_ then you should discuss it with them.  If for any reason (other then medical) they dont want you to take it_ or if they try to give you a one pill/day preventative_ find a new Doctor.

Am now using Zomig nasal spray (which I heard about from a radio programme) which works better because sometimes the pills are not absorbed if I wake up with a migraine.  But my migraines are becoming more frequent & I wonder whether this is due to switching to the spray or something else.

I also take Topamax and Neurontin for migraine prevention (which is usually very effective).I have tried almost every migraine medication out there - Imitrex_ Maxalt_ Axert. Maxalt and Axert both worked for a while_ but I started developing bad sign affects from them and was unable to keep the medication down. I'm lucky my insurance covers 9 pills with a reasonable co-pay. I guess all insurance is different. Because the Axert was unreasonably expensive (and the I think the Maxalt was also).

My MD gave me this med for migraines as I was sick of the narcotics I had used.. vicodin_ percocet_ etc. I began to notice breast pain and hot flashes but since I am going through menopause I did not think it a problem but it has not decreased at all_ as it has in the past. It is worse and it is awful. My dog leaned against me and my breasts hurt so much I almost screamed. Also I have some very scary memory loss_ never had anything like this before. I have had a few times when I lost what I did one moment ago. I have memory issues anyway but never like this. But I attributed it to stress. I also have some  mild water retention_ swelling in my ankles_ even though I work out_ eat right... etc_ but I took off my ankle socks yesterday and saw a big indentation where they ended.

I hate that you can only get a limited amount a month (I get 12 a month) but by cutting the 5 mg in half I can make it through a month before running out.

Zomig is expensive but I tell you I would pay $100 for one pill if I had to.  Just one suggestion.  Take Zomig at the onset of migraine.  The longer you wait the longer it takes the Zomig to work.

When I was first prescribed this drug by my physician I had a fear of taking it_ but then when I finally took the plunge and took it I was magnificently surprised at how well it worked on my migraine and has since. I take the 2.5 mg tablet which takes anywhere between 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours to work_ then like magic the migraine is gone. This is a lot better then my migraines lasting for 18 to 30 hours. I get about 8 or so headaches per month_ I thought they would end with menopause but they haven't. D-A-R-N!This truly is a wonder drug for me.,F,56,7  years,11/10/2007,Zomig
151, 5, Migraines,Fuzzy thinking_ facial pain (by my cheekbones)_ dizziness_  extreme thirst_ increase in urine output_ and warm water feels hot. Gets rid of the migraine within 45 minutes usually.  Side effects are much easier to deal with than migraines. Also_ Zomig gets rid of the extreme fatigue I get with migraines.  Within 2 hours I feel clear-headed.,The side effects are less severe now that I've taken Zomig for 2 years.,F,41,2  years,11/2/2007,Zomig
152, 4, migraines,drowsiness_ weakness in arms_ legs_ and hands_ burning sensation in nose_ frequent urination_ more sensative to hot water,If helps my migraines if I take it as soon as I feel one coming on.  Otherwise_ it only helps if I take it and go to sleep for about 2 hours. Overall_ it is worth the side effects to get rid of the headache. Side effects seem to be lessened if I take it with bulky food (bread_ bananas_ potatoes_ etc).,F,34,1  years,10/24/2007,Zomig
153, 5, Migraine once per month,Strange heavy_ almost swollen feeling in limbs_ feeling of sunburn all over_ warm water feels very hot_ and mild muscle soreness_ especially of my tush.  General relaxing of tightness and a strange disconnect from what is around me.  I've never taken an actual narcotic so this may be more evident for me than it is for most normal people.,Couldn't live without it.  Am finding_ however_ that after a few years of use_ the effectiveness of the drug decreases.  In the early days_ one pill would totally eradicate the headache.  Now I really do have to take one about every ten hours_ up to three or four pills_ before it is knocked out altogether.,F,33,5  years,10/12/2007,Zomig

161, 3, monthly migraines,Immediately and for about an hour after taking a 2.5 mg tablet_ I have (apparently) Zomig-induced nausea (which I normally don't have with my usually occular migraines)_ and the headache actually worsens.  Once the Zomig kicks in and my vision returns_ I'm left with a general fogginess and sometimes a lingering headache for the remainder of the day_ but I can function - much different than when I was taking Imitrex and couldn't live life for a few hours after the onset.,I've been getting migraines about once a month for the past 10 years.  After reading others' comments_ and having already been dissatisfied with Imitrex and a few other medications over the years_ I'll probably try a different form of Zomig - the dissolving tablets sound like the alternative to try.,F,49,1  years,8/7/2007,Zomig

Now I mostly just get drowsey.,If I catch it right away_ it goes away in about 30 minutes_ sometimes it can take 2 or 3 hours_ but it is so worth it.  Nothing else has worked for me.

165, 3, migraine headaches,Tightness in muscle of the neck and shoulders.  Joint pain and skin sensitivity.  Sore throat.  Hot flashes.,This medication took my migraine away after about 1 hour and with sleep.  However_ the side effects still made it difficult to function throughout the day.  I can deal w/ the drowsiness_ but everything else makes the medication almost unworthy of its effectiveness.,F,,3  months,6/18/2007,Zomig

I moved onto the dissolving type and this has resulted in a lessening of this effect but still cures the migraine efficiently,I have suffered from migraines since I was in my early teens.During menapause they became incredibly harsh and my doctor prescribed Zomig it has been incredible and I would recommend them to anyone.

These side effects last about an hour or 2 before all pain subsides.",Though the side effects are unpleasant_ and I usually can not take the drug unless I am prepared to sleep_ I usually wake up with no migraine. I should also mention that I am on 100mg of Topamax (50mg twice a day) to prevent migraines_ and I rarely get severe migraines anymore like I used to_ therefore I feel the side effects much more side I am not used to them anymore.,F,24,2  years,6/4/2007,Zomig

I've never had a panic attack before_ but that's almost the sort of reaction I had. I am highly allergic to it. Despite all that_ it seems to make most of my migraines worse rather than better. It only works half the time.,I've tried many different migraine medications like Imitrex_ Maxalt_ Frova_ Relpax_ with various degrees of success. They either don't work at all_ or I get the same side effects I do with Zomig. Relpax worked much better on the migraine_ but with the same side effects. Midrin works a little bit better for me without the side effects.,F,30,3  months,5/21/2007,Zomig

I have not had a prescription in the last 25 years or so.  After waiting out the migraines and using Advil with only sporadic and limited success_ this medicine is wonderful.  The first time I took it I could feel the migraine lift at about one hour.  It was completely gone within two to three hours.  The next two times_ the migraine started to lift after 40 minutes and was gone within an hour.  So far_ it works for me.,M,51,2  months,5/20/2007,Zomig

OTC meds were no longer working_ so my physician prescribed Zomig.  I tried it for the 1st time yesterday_ about 6 hours into my headache.  After 1 hour 45 minutes_ the headache was very suddenly GONE.  Just GONE!  I slept great last night and woke up headache free.  I hope it continues to work for me....it was wonderful!,F,51,1  days,5/15/2007,Zomig

So I switched to insruance-covered Zomig. It is not nearly as effective as Maxalt. Maxalt works within 1 hour_ usually 30 mn. Zomig takes 2 to 3 hours. Maxalt eliminates the migraine_ Zomig reduces it. Overall the greater cost for Maxalt is offset by its greater effectiveness and no side effects. If you are not getting complete relief from Zomig_ ask your doctor to get some free samples of Maxalt to try.",M,52,2  years,5/15/2007,Zomig

Even with all this_ I'd have continued it except that the throat and tongue swelling is an unacceptable side effect to my doctor_ who switched me to Maxalt before I had to start taking Topamax to prevent the frequency of my migraines.,It works.  Took between 30 and 60 minutes for mine to work_ and usually I was asleep by the time it rid me of the pain_ but it definitely WORKS!,F,47,6  years,5/1/2007,Zomig

Sometimes my neck hurts.,"I can't give Zomig a ""5"" because it has failed me sometimes_ which is probably because_ as I believe_ we sufferers should have an arsenal of pain killers to go through.  I had Imitrex stop working on me years ago_ but now it works here and there again.  I am extremely happy with Zomig ZMT_ in that it works super fast.  If I catch it in time_ my headache is gone within the hour; if I don't_ I can usually get relief in three hours.  There have been occasional times when it did not work and I got rebound that I had to sleep off for two days.  Most of this review has been with no migraine prophylaxis.  I did take amitriptyline for a while which seemed to help the Zomig respond better.

It gets rid of my migraines within 1-2 hours with no sleepiness.  I can just continue my regular activities_ whereas with each migraine I'd sleep about 14 hours straight trying to get rid of it.  The weird thing is that one doctor insisted I have sinus headaches because the pain of my migraines is often alongside my nose and can be accompanied by stuffiness.  But once I take the Zomig_ the pain and stuffiness disappear within 2 hours.  These are definitely migraines_ because migraine meds work for me!

I've on occasion forgotten to get my prescription filled in time and had to endure a migraine without it. Not a good situation. I usually split the pills in half because 2.5 mg is really all it takes and taking the whole pill makes the side effects I already get even worse.

Zomig works in about 20-30mins for me.  The sooner I take it the faster it works.  My headache is usually completely gone with one dose and doesn't come back.,M,35,1  years,10/20/2005,Zomig
214, 4, Migraines,Sensitivity to hot water and hot drinks_ sore joints and muscles.,Zomig gets rid of my migraines_ but the I do have a lot of soreness after a few hours.,F,40,2  years,10/11/2005,Zomig
215, 4, Migraines,Sensitivity to hot water and hot drinks_ sore joints and muscles.,Zomig gets rid of my migraines_ but I do have a lot of soreness after a few hours.,F,40,2  years,10/11/2005,Zomig
216, 5, Migraines,Sleepiness_ and definite muscle weakness which last over 24 hours,I really hate the sleepiness and feeling like I'm made of spaghetti but hey it knocks my headache OUT! My neurologysts switched from Imitrex to Zomig and I can say that despite the side effects I feel like I can actually live my life a little better :),F,32,1  months,10/6/2005,Zomig
217, 5, Migraine,"jaw tightening_ a little bit ""wrung out"" the next day",Zomig doesn't work as well as Maxalt_ but it does work LONGER_ so if I have an on-going migraine trigger (like being in an airplane) then it is the best choice. I was never able to fly internationally before_ now I can. The only problem is that I quickly build up a tolerance_ so I can only take it about once a month or else it doesn't work at all.,F,44,5  years,9/25/2005,Zomig
218, 4, Migraines,Tightness in the neck_ Sleepy_ light headness_ arms heavy_ trouble concentrating_ If I move my head quickly side to side (like glancing at the monitor and then down to the keyboard :) I get dizzy almost vertigo.  Some tighness in the lower back - hot and cold flashes.  The side effects are not as bad as the migraine but are getting worse the longer I take Zomig.,Generally works within about 30-45 mins to abort the migraine_ but the side effects seem to last for almost 24 hours.,M,39,5  years,8/25/2005,Zomig
219, 5, Migraines,Fatigue_ frequent urination_ definite jaw/mouth sensitivity for an hour or two after taking dissolvable pill.  Other times it may cause muscle aches/soreness the next day - and if I take it before bed or in the middle of the night_ it can give me some very strange dreams.  The thing about the side effects is that sometimes I'll take the Zomig and I'll have very minimal/barely noticable side effects ... and other times I'll take it and get hit with a strong fatigue/sensitive throat/malaise that just makes me want to sleep all day.  The stronger side effects don't happen as often as the more minimal side effect times.,Zomig ZMT (dissolvable pill) works the best for me out of any of the triptans.  It has truly been a lifesaver.  It does come with side effects_ but I would take ANY of them over a migraine_ no questions asked!  I hate the taste of the dissolvable pill - which can be difficult to ingest when you're already nauseous.  However_ the ZMT version works better for me than the regular pill.  I feel relief within an hour.  I drink a lot of water or else I can get constipated while taking Zomig.  If I have a very severe migraine_ I'll try to take it easy/be mellow while the Zomig goes to work.  I've woken up in the middle of the night before with a severe_ side-splitting migraine at its height - taken a Zomig_ managed to get back to sleep_ and woken up completely pain free.,F,22,5  years,8/18/2005,Zomig
220, 4, migraine,Breast pain_ stomach ulcer_ nausea_ depression_ general icky feeling_ severe rebound headache cycles on the rapimelt version (took for 3 years--final 6 months gave more side effects). Switched to the regular tablet and have had no side effects so far (3 months).,The regular tablet version works very well for me. The migraine goes away within 1 hour_ and no rebounds!,F,36,3  years,7/21/2005,Zomig
221, 4, menstural migraines,Senstivity in the jaw area esp to drinks and foods.  Extremely drowsy and body feels heavy after I take Zomig. I think that my sexual desire has decreased because of it--I am not 100% sure; but taking Zomig is the only thing that has changed in my lifestyle.,Zomig defintely works_ for me_ within 30 minutes.  However_ I experience alot more side effects with Zomig than I did with Imitrex.  My Docotor recently prescribed Zomig because my new pharmacy didn't carry Imitrex.,F,29,4  months,7/16/2005,Zomig
222, 5, migraines,Just a skin and tongue sensitivity to hot water and hot drinks,,F,52,2  days,6/23/2005,Zomig
223, 4, Migraines,Groggy hangover plus shoulder and hip muscles ache for hours after taking it.,Wonderful relief for headache as long as I can take it in time.  99% of my headaches start while I am asleep at night and I awake with the pain.  If the nausea has not started_ the Zomig knocks the headache out in 30 minutes.,F,57,3  years,6/9/2005,Zomig
224, 4, Chronic migraines,Slight dizziness_ slurred speech_ burning sensation in the face.,Zomig helps my migraines a lot- usually the pain has almost completely disappeared in about 20-45 minutes.The side effects I notice aren't very bad. Slight dizziness that comes and goes over the course of about 2 hours after taking the drug_ and for about a half hour_ my speech is somewhat slowed down and slurred (which doesn't really bother me personally_ and it goes away.) The only side effect that concerned me was a tingling_ burning sensation on the skin of my face_ almost like a sunburn_ which lasts quite a while. But overall_ I'd say the results are worth putting up with the side effects.,F,19,4  months,5/21/2005Email,Zomig
225, 1, ocular migraines,I have only taken this medication once. I was out with my friends and got a migraine so I took it and I immedately passed out. My friends tell me that I would twitch_ whine_ and clutch my head when I was asleep. When I finally woke up my face was extremely teneder and tight_ my jaw didn't really work_ and my thoat was completely sore. It felt like I was being choked. I didn't remember anything for about two hours before I passed out either.  It was a really scarry expeirience,I have never read about anything like this happening to anybody else before_ but it really scared me.,F,17,1  days,4/23/2005,Zomig
226, 4, Migraine,Pain in jaw_ sore throat_ achiness_ occasionally a feeling of hotness,It works for me if I take it as soon as I have a bad migraine. But if I take it too often it won't work as well so I have to pick my battles. Also if taken too late into the migraine it won't help_ or if the migraine is severe_ I need to take phrenilin and/or aleve to help it along. Other than that_ when it works_ it's great and I can continue with my daily activities!,F,30,6  months,4/9/2005Email,Zomig
227, 5, migraine relief,Before it rids me of the migraine_ I get a Zomig-induced nausea(different than the migraine's nausea)_ and a general sense of feeling lousy.  Once the Zomig kicks in and rids me of my headache_ this nausea/bad feeling goes away. My neurologist said this is a documented side effect that some people have w/ Zomig and with other triptans. Zomig 5mg works for me about 90% of the time if I take it at the onset of my headache.  The 10% that it doesn't work is usually if I have a migraine while driving and I continue to drive after taking the Zomig.,Tried Maxalt and Axert_ and Zomig works much better for me.  Be sure to take it at the onset of migraine symptoms_ otherwise it doesn't work as well.  In the past_ when I got a migraine in the middle of the night_ I was too lazy to get out of bed_ and I paid the price in the morning with a horrible migraine that was much tougher to get rid of.  Now I keep the Zomig in an easily accessible place in the bathroom and I know to drag myself out of bed to nip it in the bud.,F,42,3  years,3/29/2005,Zomig
228, 5, Migraines,Sleepiness_ dehydration,I use the nasal spray because I sometimes vomit after taking the orally dissolving tablets (rendering them useless).  The nasal spray also works about 30 minutes faster (for me).  I have found that for me it is the most effective of all the abortive migraine medications_ working 100% of the time I use it.  I use it in conjunction with Topamax as a daily preventative.,F,30,2  years,3/23/2005,Zomig
229, 5, Migraine,Sometimes it makes me sightly tired_ almost drowsy.  I think there is some rebound effect (I may begin to experience another headache  within 24-36 hours) with Zomig also.,I have tried other triptans_ but have had the best success with Zomig.  It always works if I take 5 mg.  Sometimes I will only take 2.5mg and that often works.,M,65,3  years,1/11/2005Email,Zomig
230, 5, monthly/bi-monthly migraines,occasionally feel sleepy after taking pill,This medication has changed my life. Previously I could spend up to 3 days in a dark room paralyzed with pain. Now I no longer experience migraines_ unless I don't have pill at hand. Almost panic feeling if I run out of pills_ relief knowing they are there.,F,49,3  years,1/5/2005,Zomig
231, 2, migraine's every day,,This drug did not put a dent in my migraines.  I started taking it because I was having daily migraines for months.  I am now taking Inderal to prevent them_ but I have to take Fioricet and Robaxin at the same time to make them go away.,F,22,2  weeks,12/16/2004,Zomig
232, 5, Stress - tension headaches,,Zomig is Wonderful - has saved my sanity!  I tried Imitrex but it did not help.,F,48,3  years,11/21/2004,Zomig
233, 4, Frequent Migraines,Fatigue_ drowsiness_ body/muscle aches.,I use Zomig in conjunction with another migraine drug - I use Zomig when I can identify my migraine early and only when I can dedicate time to sleep.  I use the other for times when I can not sleep_ must drive_ am not at home etc.  Zomig has worked on migraines caused by my monthly cycle as well as stress and weather induced migraines - usually within 30 minutes and with just one dose.  I have_ on occasion_ had to take a second dose as indicated by manufacturer.  The bottom line is: it works.  It relieves pain and minimizes the migraine.,F,30,6  months,10/25/2004,Zomig
234, 3, migraine,This drug helps a lot if taken at the very onset of a migraine but it does cause you to feel achy all over_ when i took more than 3 tablets in a day all my muscles ached and this has lasted for a long time_ but it does clear the migraine!,Still have a general all over body ache particilarly the shoulders and arms_ jaw tightens but this goes after about an hour. think you should really only take 1 tablet in 24 hours else the muscle ache feelings go on for weeks.,F,40,1  days,10/11/2004,Zomig
235, 2, Migraines,Only medication my doctor prescribes for my migraines.  I take the Zomig and throw up before the Zomig ever gets a chance to work.  So_ maybe this is not Zomig`s fault_ but_ the fact that I always throw up and black out with my migraines.   No preventative medication other than Zomig_ per my doctor~but_ this does not work at all for me. Makes me sleepy on top of my migraine_ nausea_ dizziness and black~outs.,,F,46,5  years,9/12/2004,Zomig

238, 3, Severe_ DAILY Migraines,Generally there have been no side effects_ per se! But I have had something rather strange (to me) happen while on the medication. I usually dissolve the tablet in the center of my tongue_ however_ after some months of this practise_ I developed a 'hole' in my tongue (a smooth spot_ with sharply defined edge). I have NO evidence that the Zomig caused this_ but I do feel strongly that it did. My Migraines have reduced (drastically) in frequency this Spring and Summer_ so my reliance on Zomig has decreased. However_ I've taken Zomig some four or five times_ over the past month. Cognizant of my unease regarding causing 'holes' to appera on my tongue_ I took the Zomig and placed them farther back on my tongue to dissolve. Yesterday_ I noticed that I now have a second 'hole' on my tongue_ farhter back then the original 'hole.'Has anyone noticed anything similar?Has anyone any ideas about cause? Treatment options?,I'm not wild about the taste of the Zomig Rapimelt. I find it overly sweet. Not a big problem_ but ,M,66,30  months,8/26/2004Email,Zomig
239, 5, migraine,Grogginess_ especially if taken without food.  I take 2.5 mg at a time_ and I tend to have high sensitivity to drugs.,This medicine has changed my life.  I had migraines for 8 years before discovering Zomig.  Now_ instead of having to give 5-10 days each month over to the migraine gods_ I can take a Zomig and go to work_ play_ continue life like a normal functioning human being.  God bless the people who make this drug.  If only this were less expensive!,F,28,1.5  years,7/23/2004Email,Zomig

The worst side effect_ which is not listed that concerns me is severe breast and nipple pain_ it hurts to even sit up_ and forget about touching them!  It feels like the breast pain associated with the first few days of breastfeeding_ that kind of horredous pain_ worse than ripping your toe nails off!  It's weird_ anyone had this side effect?,Please post_ my doctor is at the VA_ and it takes months to get a response from them!
