0, 4, Depression,Slurred speech (which cleared up after a few days). Auditory  and Visual Hallucinations (primarily Auditory) which did not clear up. Difficulty concentrating.,I took an anti-psychotic with this medication because of the side-affects I experienced... which I started on approximately a week after starting. The reason why I put 4 was because_ regardless of the side-affects_ this is the only medication that has successfully helped my depression. I loved it while I was on it_ but I dropped all my medication for some time. I'm actually considering getting back on it because nothing else has helped. I have been on Prozac (which I had to continually up because I gained a tolerance to it extremely quickly)_ Paxil (made me hella happy but put me out... I was constantly sleeping)_ Abilify (I barely remember taking this one... but I know it made me feel flat/emotionless)_ Depakote (this one made my depression WORSE! I had horrible mood-swings and was angry or depressed for the 5 hours each day that I was actually awake).I will note that Lithium probably isn't the drug for everyone. I was placed on it because I was against artificial drugs and my psych made a plea-bargain with me. I've dealt with a psychotic disorder for years now_ so the hallucinations didn't bother me that much_ but they do make it hellishly hard to concentrate.But still_ what it did for my mood without completely knocking me on my butt or taking me so freaking far out reality... was amazing.I loved it.,M,19,6  months 1X D,6/2/2010,Lithium citrate

3, 1, bi-polar,got lithium poisoning_ no concept of time or reality_ the people around me and I didnt feel anything was wrong. Pass out mid sentence mid motion,This has got to be the worst drug I've ever been put on. It took 4 weeks of trying to convince the NP that it wasn't the methadone. I stopped taking the methadone to prove it 3 days later they couldnt even wake me up. i was days away from coma. They stopped te lithium after having my levels checked FINALLY! and I was one point away from the highest possible rate. I'm 5'2 110_ I could have died. The scary part wasnt the toxisity_ it was coming off it. Being toxic you havent a clue. As I was coming down I noticed how much hair I was loosing_ How I couldnt read or write_ I also had a hard time walking and putting sentences togethr. I would get lost in my thoughts. It took about 2 mo to finally be able to function halfway normal. I still have cognitive problems and post tramatic stress from this. Lithium is a chemical labotomy and there are much more safe drugs availible now that dont reqire you to be tested every week. There is a 0.1 difference between theraputic and toxic and toxic in so,F,33,3  months,12/7/2007Email,Lithium citrate

Which I tried to explain to the Dr. but of course_ she knew better!  Horrible_ horrible experience.  Had to move back home_ couldn't do simple things like balance my checkbook_ do my job_ or be left alone even for a moment.  It truly was a kind of hell.
