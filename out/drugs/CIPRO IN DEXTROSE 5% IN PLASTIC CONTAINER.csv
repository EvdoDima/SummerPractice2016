0, 1, diverticulitis,nauseous_ throwing up_ MIALGIA SYMPTOMS,Should be taken off the market- it is running people's life- there must be other antibiotics to do the same job.,F,68,19  days500mg 2X D,11/29/2010,Cipro in dextrose 5% in plastic container
1, 4, Ciprofloxacin,NONE  (Sleepy-which was good),I took Ciprofloxacin (which is not the HC or ear drops)and it was great. I was sick bad from food poisoning for 6 long days and within 2 hours after taking the pill I felt relieved. Dont be worried. Millions of people take this and have no side effects but they dont come on here. The people on here googled themselves into anxiety... I did too! LOL. Research is good! Keep doing it.But this drug did nothing but make me feel sleepy because it made me feel partially relaxed. NOT DRUNK NOT DIZZY NOTHING BAD. I literally just felt sleepy for about twenty minutes. I drank water and it went away.,M,28,5  days500 2X D,9/19/2010Email,Cipro in dextrose 5% in plastic container
2, 1, UTI,Insomnia_ feeling of doom_ ear ringing_ red face_ exhaustion_ joint pain.,It has been 2 yrs and 3 months.  Not much has changed.  I have simply become accustomed to my physical state.  Less feeling of doom though. Also have returned to lifting light weights and exercising.Nightly dose of 1 ibuprofen and 3 mg melatonin helps me sleep 4-5 hrs.  1-2 hrs without.  Generally feel better if I sleep without worry. Melatonin by itself never helped me before.  Let me know if anyone else has tried this. Reluctant to see doctors for any ailments now.,M,52,30  days500 2X D,3/9/2010Email,Cipro in dextrose 5% in plastic container
3, 2, Lung infection,I woke up after two doses of 500mg and had what felt like strep throat. Coughed_ and blood came up. Throat is still sore. Helped the coughing and breathing immediately_ but I didn't expect the side effects.,,M,62,1  days,6/6/2009Email,Cipro in dextrose 5% in plastic container
4, 1, infection,Extreme_ EXTREME pain. I feel like I'm 80. I'm 20.,,,, ,5/25/2009,Cipro in dextrose 5% in plastic container
5, 1, UTI Infection,Nausea_ back pain_ extreme bloating_ I look like I am 7 months pregnant,I would never take this medicine again. I feel so much worse than I did with my UTI. I have read complaint after complaint. This medicine is dangerous and should be taken off the market. Do not take or ever give to your children.,F,54,2  days,4/9/2009Email,Cipro in dextrose 5% in plastic container
6, 5, UTI,none_ maybe in the beginning a little irritability and drowsiness but it went away.,Worked very well.,F,28,7  days,7/18/2007,Cipro in dextrose 5% in plastic container
7, 1, UTI,Too many to mention - insomnia_ panic attacks_ muscle pains_ joint pains_ eye pains_ hurts to look at lights_ diagnosis of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue and peripheral neuropathy.  NONE of the above existed until just after taking Cipro.  I can barely walk most days due to nerve damage (neuropathy).  This is nasty stuff !  I'd say more but then no one would believe me !!,These side effects do NOT go away with stopping the pills. They LAST for months or even YEARS among those who have the effects. There is no way to tell who will  have the side effects AND no way to treat them once you do.  Just have to wait it out and pray !!,F,40,5  days,2/9/2005,Cipro in dextrose 5% in plastic container
