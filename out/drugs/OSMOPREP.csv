0, 1, Colonoscopy Prep,Bloating_ nausea_ thirst_ high blood pressure_ headache_ general discomfort.,"I took this for colonoscopy prep thinking it would be easy. It's easy to take_ but it didn't work despite following the directions meticulously. I was loaded with the drug (which is sodium-based) for a week and miserable with headaches_ high blood pressure_ bloating_ and generally feeling awful. Yes_ it's easier_ but it's terrible to wake up after the procedure and hear ""we couldn't see all of your colon--you need to do this again.""",F,51,1  days32 tabs 1X D,1/17/2013Email,Osmoprep
