3, 1, UTI,I was 17 when I took Bactrim for a UTI_ I was a month away from turning 18 and was given this because another antibiotic would have more side effects I was told. I took it for 5 days and became horribly sick from a nasty cold and was told to stop Bactrim and to take Z Pac instead for 5 days. As soon as I stopped taking the Bactrim the next morning I broke out in hives. I thought it was a heat rash but it was all over my body and a cold bath did not get rid of it. Called my doctor and said it's likely a sulfa allergy. Couldn't take Benadryl to get rid of it because I had a fever and didn't want to become dehydrated. Had to stay home from work and school for an entire week until the rash went away. Absolutely horrible experience. Thankfully my UTI was gone by the time I stopped taking it.,Common allergy,F,19,5  days,8/2/2016Email,Bactrim

Lethargic_ messed up heart rhythm _ feel like I'm dying_ swollen_ increased appetite _ headache_ nervousness . I wished I had read side effects of taking SMZ generic for Bactrim .

This is deadly medicine,I read where this medicine can cause death and where 49 yr old man took aspirin and had kidney failure & had to have blood transfusion. Also this medicine can cause Steven Johnson syndrome (sjs) which causes your skin to peel off your body exposing flesh which causes other infections.

18, 1, Bacterial infection from cyst.,I didn't have any side effects from the drug until I stopped taking it. First day after last dose I had small rash on my back where my bra lays... Didn't think anything about it. That night I had red pinpoints on my whole body. Slowly grew into a large rash. Felt like I had a 3rd degree sunburn. Took benadryl for two to three days till I felt like it was cleared up. Now a week after the last dose I am covered in hives_ I itch like crazy_ my knee joints and ankles are swollen. The rash slowly moved up my scalp_ and neck and onto my face. I could have dealt with the rash and uncomfortable itchiness but I began to have problems breathing. I went to the er last night and am now on two antihistamines_ a steroid_ and an inhaler. Along with giving me an epinephrine shot_ my resting heart rate was at 130 (that's what I am at when I am jogging) I made sure to put sulfer antibiotics onto my allergy list.

20, 1, UTI,If I could give this drug a minus I would!  it started off just giving me stomach pain_ but apparently I became lethargic_ dehydrated and incoherent_ and if it weren't for someone finding me_ probably wouldn't be here.  They took me to the ER where I'm told I had tons of tests despite them being told I was on a new antibiotic_ which they were told was irrelevant.  My liver enzymes were elevated_ but all the testing returned nothing else and I was sent back home with the advice to contact my doctor!  Wow_ thanks.  My friends had the good sense to stop the medication_ and in a few days I started to come around_ but that was so scary!  I thought I was an exception_ but seems from what I'm reading here it's not at all.,With all the issues surrounding this drug_ I can't understand why it is still so freely prescribed!,F,62,4  days 1X D,6/8/2016,Bactrim

After being on Bactrim for 8 days noticed several small hives on my upper thighs. Per doctor instructions_ I stopped taking the antibiotic and began taking Benadryl. By the next day they have spread down my leg and up my chest.  It's been two days since I first noticed and I'm covered all over my body_ hands_ feet and face.

25, 2, Skin infection,Widespread rash_ black patches of skin_ severe fever_ headaches_ fatigue_ chills_ hot skin_ dehydration,After about ten days_ I developed a widespread rash all over my body but particularly on my arms and legs. It was flat_ red_ and hot to the touch. There were patches along the inside of my limbs that were nearly black. I developed a 103F fever that kept me perpetually tired and bedbound. It was painful to do simple tasks like walk to the bathroom_ shower_ heat myself soup_ etc._ because I always felt a chill.Went to a clinic where the doctor informed me that I had Stevens-Johnson syndrome_ a rare_ skin-rotting allergic reaction to sulfa medications like Bactrim. He told me the mortality rate was 55%. Clinic called an ambulance to take me to the hospital_ and my mother had to tell them to refuse so she could take me herself. Didn't wait long to get into the ER because staff was afraid I'd go into shock. Had an IV put into both arms.Luckily_ my case was minor_ and I was allowed to go home. However_ I could have died if I put off seeking medical attention for longer. I don't blame the doctor for prescribing me Bactrim_ but I'd advise caution if you don't know what medicine allergies you have. If I had been given a sulfa drug during or after an emergency surgery_ I very well could have died.,F,22,10  daysBactrim DS 2X D,5/13/2016Email,Bactrim

A lot of information says you have a rash with drug reactions. I did NOT. My skin infection did clear up. It wasn't that bad to start with. I asked him for something topical. Was not my regular Doc who prescribed it. My Doc said it was overkill. Just because the guy's a doctor doesn't  mean he is a good doctor! Be your own advocate. Another round of this crap--who knows!

In the morning_ I continued my bactrim regiment and by mid-day couldn't wear a shoe on my right foot because it would send radiating pain up into my calf area. I continued taking the pill. On the third day_ I woke up_ got out of bed_ and immediately fell to the floor in excruciating pain. So much as running my fingernail along my foot sent unbearable pain shooting up into my leg. Touching other areas sent an odd itching sensation throughout my limb. I'm experiencing tingling_ a pin-prick pain randomly throughout my body_ and random pains and itches without any stimulation.

I called the pharmacist who suggested that I up my water intake. For my next dose_ I drank half a bottle of water before taking the pill followed by another full bottle of water after swallowing the pill. I also had a small snack each time I took a dose_ right after the water consumption. And then I kept water close by all day.

41, 4, MRSA pressure ulcer / osteomyelytis,stomach pain_ bloating_ insomnia_ exhaustion_ nausea_ and possibly constipation.,This is an incomplete review as I have not followed up with my doctor yet (appointment this week). However_ I have had a pressure ulcer (open wound) for almost 1 year. They found I had a bone infection and had to do 6 weeks of IV meds. The IV meds killed off all the infections EXCEPT MRSA. Rather than going back to IV meds_ the doctor prescribed a high dose of Bactrim. I am almost 3 weeks into the treatment and the wound seems to have actually closed - this is of course pending results from various tests that will be done in the following weeks. However_ this is one of the most hopeful signs I have had in almost a year. The side effects can be bad and I sometimes dread having to take the medicine_ but if the end result is that it allowed my open wound to finally close_ it will be worth the side effects. I will post a follow up review after seeing my doctors_ but just wanted to post this for any of those in a similar situation to try to stick with it as long as the side effects are not extremely horrible (based on your physician's advice).,M,31,18  days1600 2X D,3/28/2016Email,Bactrim

The pain in my neck_ head_ and every joint in my body was unbearable. If you already experience any of these problems I highly do not recommend taking Bactrim; or if you're sensitive to medicine.

43, 3, Staph/abscess,Sweating_ feeling extremely hot_ headache_ upset stomach towards the end of taking medication. Loss of appetite. Heartburn/acid reflux.,I generally feel ill when taking antibiotics and Bactrim was no different. It was not as bad as other people have experienced though. I didn't have nausea or vomiting because with most antibiotics you have to eat first and drink plenty of water. I'd eat and then 10-15 minutes after I would take my pill. I did however always feel like I was constantly burning up from the inside out. No matter what temp my environment was I was always hot. And I did get headaches that medicine didn't really help with. I only have 2 more days of the medication and I've started to have diarrhea/more frequent bowel movements. I've tried to take a probiotic every day with the meds to hopefully prevent this. And it wasn't extremely noticeable to me until today but I have had loss of appetite. I did not eat dinner at all last night and when I tried to eat today I did feel a little queasy. Also for the past few days I've had really bad acid reflux while laying down. These symptoms are basically all mild and not unbearable.

It also took the Bactrim 3 days to start working. I had UTI's before and cannot remember it taking this long for any medication to work that they had given me in the past. It is now Monday_ of all days_ and I have to go back to work today after being off all week long last week. I think that Bactrim would be okay for a short term illness_ but should not be taken for 14 days. It is a pretty strong drug. I also still have symptoms of this UTI. It should be completely gone after taking this medication for two weeks as well. I feel much better other than the side effects but still feel a little bit of pain in my pelvic area. From the comments that I had read above_ it sounds like a lot of those people are allergic to this drug. I would had called my doctor immediately and had him take me off of it. I do not want to take this stuff again either. There has to be something better out there that works a lot faster too. I think some doctors just believe in some medications more than others. They need to listen to the patients more often. Give them what they say works best for them. There is no reason why he could not have put me on something that worked faster than 3 days.

I was also prescribed 60mg. Prednisone_ with no taper_ for the first 5 days I was on the Bactrim DS. I was blaming Prednisone ""withdrawal"" for my symptoms at first and kept taking the Bactrim DS. I almost had a hard-core kidney function test to see if that was the case_ but fortunately_ did not. My ENT told me to stop the Bactrim as I had been on 10 days of a 14 day prescription. Normally_ I am a bright_ healthy_ happy 44 year-old woman with a busy massage therapy practice. This drug has_ hopefully_ temporarily changed that! I have finally been able to sleep through the night_ but cannot fall back to sleep when my husband gets up early for work_ and usually_ I can.

I read 500 of the posts on this site_ but very few come back to give their progress or to tell how long it took them to recover and what treatments they used to combat the side effects and recover. I am taking 250 mg. magnesium before bed each night for the muscle and nerve issues_ drinking cranberry juice and a TON of water. I felt better the first day off the drug than I do today_ which_ again_ is day 4 off of it. I think the reason I felt better was because I was able to finally eat.

Started drinking ensure to wash the chemicals out of my liver.  This occurred in 1990.The doctor was obviously not aware that blood liver tests are to be done every 7 days while taking this drug.   Also did not recognise the adverse reactions was the drug.  I was sick for 3 months.   Long term damage is slow liver metabolism.  This makes it hard for my liver to filter out medications which than build up.  So I have to take half the dose amount of the adult dose on almost all meds.

Initially_ I was tired when I took the first dose. I thought it was because of the infection. On the 5th day I woke up with chills_ a 102 fever and severe pain in my head and neck. I almost went to the ER because I thought I was having a stroke or something the headache was so bad. Went to my Dr. he thought I had a virus_ took blood and urine and sent me home. I couldn't work for 4 days all I could do was lay down and shiver with chills. The fever broke on the 4th day but the headache/neck pain lasted for another two days. I lost 13 lbs in the 4 days that I was sick and didn't get my appetite back for another 3 days after the fever broke. All labs came back there was no virus_ and my creatinine levels were high in my kidneys_ I went to Google to see if it could have been caused by the Bactrim. That was also a side effect. I have to go back to the doctor this month to check and see if permanent damage was done to my kidneys. It was the worst experience I have ever had in my life with any medication. I felt poisoned and wonder what would have happened to me if I had completed the entire 10 days suggested by the doctor. Scary stuff.,F,35,6  days 2X D,9/10/2015,Bactrim

I felt horrendous and sleepy and I literally could not stay awake. Since I've been taking these pills all I can do is either stay up and fight off the fever sweats/shakyness or succumb to the tiredness and sleep all day long. Problem is I've done nothing but sleep for 3 days and I'm just as tired. Bad medicine!,F,21,4  days800,8/29/2015,Bactrim

117, 2, Skin Problem,First day - I was extremely nauseous on a short car ride to dinner and I never get nauseous during car rides. I also couldn't balance a few times and almost fell. I couldn't fall asleep until 2:30 AM.Second day (current day) - I didn't have much of an appetite_ but forced myself to eat something. Afterwards_ I ran to the bathroom and got diarrhea. About an hour after taking my first pill of the day_ I noticed that my hands were extremely shaky (and still are - it's 11 PM now). I figured it must have been me being hungry_ but it went on even after I ate. All day I felt fatigue and tiredness. Right now I can't fall asleep even though I was tired an hour ago and still kind of am tired. I also feel nauseous. Also_ all day I've been mentally out of it. Now my throat feels really weird_ kind of sore.,"I don't know if this is the bactrim that's causing all of this_ but from what I've read on here_ it sounds like bactrim is causing these side affects. I have never felt this miserable except for when I was on Adderall for ADHD. I'm still taking this drug because my doctor prescribed it to me and my mom literally does not care about the side effects. She told me to not read the side effects. I did anyways and I'm glad I did. My mom also told me to not overlook how I feel because it's probably not side effects. I don't know how to tell her about how this medication is making me feel_ but it's annoying that she doesn't believe me when I say how I'm feeling is probably caused by bactrim. For example_ when I told her my hands were shaking (while we were at dinner when I was eating)_ she told me_ ""Eat during the day and maybe your hands won't be shaky."" I did eat during the day. This obviously has to be the bactrim that's causing all of this to happen.

Had to be checked into hospital for 4 days.  I developed a-fib with my heart and hyperactive thyroid.  Was never in a hospital prior to this.  Didn't know I was allergic because issues started like the flu.  Wasn't until day 8 that non-flu symptoms started and convinced me to look into Bactrim allergy issue.

123, 1, possible UTI,I started having slight nausea after 2 doses.  After the 3rd dose I had a severe migraine headache_ a stiff neck_ sore achy joints_ and no appetite.  Stopped taking Bactrim and called the PA.  After describing the symptoms I was told to stop taking it.  Did not sleep at all the 2nd night due to body soreness_ flu-like all over skin tenderness.  Had a fever of 101+ for 2 days.  Advil relieved the body aches_ but not the neck stiffness and headache.  Took 4 days to reduce the fever_ but still have occasional bursts of feeling feverish_ followed by cold sweats 5 days later.  My appetite is back_ though not at 100%_ neck is still sore but not rigid stiff_ and I'm very tired.  Awaiting results of blood tests for Lyme and other possible similar symptomatic causes.,I was once prescribed this antibiotic to take with me abroad in case of traveler's diarrhea_ but I never took it so my records showed it as OK to prescribe.

My dr. prescribed it for 21 days and I have only 5 left (counting hard).  It seems to be working on both my UTI and my BPH so I guess I will lump it with the side efffects and take it all as prescribed.

Having shortness of breath is a legitimate symptom of allergy. A lot of people I know are allergic to Bactrim_ which has evidently become like saying you're allergic to cyanide or gun shots.

ALL but the head ache and diarrhea presented AFTER the last pill and have taken a over a week now to slowly subside. I took thi once before at a higher dose and it took close to 6 months for the nerve pain and a few other symptoms to disappear. Hoping this time_ since it was a lower dose it won't take as long. A TINY part of me is glad I took it again because back 2 years ago when I took it my doctor told me I had a virus on top of my infection and THAT was causing the myalgia and other symptoms. She was soooo wrong. It was this med. I have reported my side effects and INSISTED that my doctor update my records so that I NEVER recieve bactrim again. So glad my reaction wasn't worse.

On day 2 of my symptoms I went to my general family dr_ worried I had the flu. Flu and steep tests were negative. She suggested I MIGHT be having an allergic reaction to the Bactrim_ and told me to consult my Dermotologist since he prescribed it. The next day (3) I was going to see the Dermo to get stitches removed. I called her on day 3 after I woke up with new symptoms and she said to stop taking immediately- BUT I had already taken my am dosage. When I went to dermo he also agreed and said to stop taking.

I was discharged and given Prednisone and Azithromyazin?_ an the following day I felt GREAT! 5 days later_ I still feel great and really breathe better than I have in a long time_ probably the Prenissone. This medication (Bactrim) is dangerous_ and_ according to what I have researched_ never should have been given to me_ an 81 year old male with COPD. It has been banned in the UK after causing multiple deaths_ and why it is still prescribed her in the US is beyond me.  ,M,81,3  days160mg 2X D,3/20/2015Email,Bactrim

I took these permenantly damaging pills last April 2013....i was healthy_ now i am partially parlyized on the left side of my body and much more.  This brand of collagen targets the worst areas that are the most damaged and my pain was 80-90% of my pain diminshed in less then 1 week - i suffered chronically for more than a year since being Floxed.

I found out later that in order to get rid of my MRSA infection_ I needed to cleanse my body from head to toe with Hipiclens which they sell at the pharmacy and I was prescibed Mupirocin Ointment which I applied on my surgical incision where the Staph Infection had occured.... I did that twice at day and cleaned that area with Hibiclens as well. I kept it covered with a gauze and bandage.... That it was dryed up the infection not the antibiotics.

Recently_ a cyst the size of a dime popped up on my jawline and my dermatologist put me on Bactrim.  The first thing she asked was if I was allergic to sulfur.  I knew that I wasn't because of the sodium sulfacetamide cleanser I had used in the past for dermatitis.What surprises me the most is that the people commenting on the side-effects obviously were not asked about this allergy by their doctor.  I'm sorry to hear the pain it caused so many of you but thought it might help to know you very well could be allergic to sulfur - it's the main ingredient and the pill form of the cleanser I mentioned above.Hope that helps!,F,37,12  days800 2X D,9/2/2014,Bactrim

Then I started getting big purple bruises on my legs_ which led me back to the ER.  Another Benadryl cocktail and a RX for steroids.  I was unable to sleep the next 36 hours and wanted to itch off every inch of my skin.  The purple bruising continued.  Long story short_ I had a 3rd futile visit to an inadequate ER at which I passed out at the front door and finally found my way to an awesome dermatologist on Monday who gave me proper diagnosis and treatment.

Before I realized the rash was from this and stopped taking it_ my stomach was very cramped_ similar to constant period cramping_ dizzy_ nauseous_ digestive issues_ saw halos around light_  and my ears were bright red and on fire.

280, 3, Staph Skin Infection,First few days my 5 year old son didn't seem to have any side effects.  The Staph seemed to be healing.  As he entered the end of the first week of taking Bactrim_ he began to complain of his stomach hurting--bad_ his eyes hurting--bad.  We just thought he was trying to stay home from school_ so we sent him on.  He started getting in trouble at school_ (this is our 5 year old_ who previous to Bactrim never had any bad behavior).  He hit a friend two days in a row_ once with a pencil_ and once with his hand.  Then continued to exhibit lack of self control the third day by pulling down his pants and then sitting and crying (screaming at his teachers!!)  He has NEVER acted so erratic.  This continued at home and we were beginning to wonder what happened to our sweet_ well-behaved child.  Once i searched Bactrim side effects in childrenÂ…it all began to make sense.  He finished his last dose last night_ and has sense had three more episodes of erratic behavior: screaming at me for not,Feelings of depression_ extreme high and low mood swings_ lack of any self control (temporary episodes)_ stomach pain_ eye pain_ lack of appetite_ sleeps but does not wake rested (possible lack of REM sleep?)_ feeling anxious and out of control.,M,5,10  days14.2 ML 2X D,3/1/2014Email,Bactrim

Then_ I  took my day 7 doses and ALL of the lymph nodes in my neck (did you know some exist in the BACK of your neck? I hadn't before this) got very large and even more tender and I felt tired and achy the entire day.  I stopped taking the medicine at that point_ on day 7 of 10 because I could feel it was doing me serious harm_ but too late -- I woke up the next morning with a bright red rash spanning from my chin to my ankles_ and my ears bright red and swollen and itchy.

I'd never taken it before and was eager to get rid of my UTI. By the end of my second day I developed fever of 102_ severe nausea_ stomach pain_ joint paint_ extreme weakness_ burning skin and total insomnia. I never connected my symptoms to the Bactrim and took it for four more days. By the sixth day I was so ill that I thought I might die. I skipped my morning dose and lo and behold began feeling a little better. By that evening my fever was gone and I started feeling human again. For the first time in a week a ate a full meal for dinner and foolishly took another Bactrim. Within an hour and a half all symptoms were back including fever_ only this time I had a new symptom - horrible heart palpitations and rib pain. I finally (hello universe!) made the connection and that's when I googled Bactrim side effects and found this site. All these stories are awful!! I will NEVER touch this drug again!!

Took three-four days for pain to completely stop.,This drug is EVIL. Do NOT take it. It's been over three weeks since I've stopped taking this drug and I still have crazy dreams_ heart palpitations (like one every 4-10 beats for the past 3 weeks almost 24/7) and occasional hallucinations when I wake up in the middle of the night like thousands of bubbles/circles/squares swirling around when eyes are closed.It seems this is NORMAL (?!?!) for side effects but it's a living hell and now I can most likely react fatally to Sulfa drugs if I ever take them again. Thanks Bactrim. I realize the red line going up my arm is not a good sign but the doc said the red line was not in danger really of doing anything to me as it was an inflammatory response to the bite which was innocuous. You die from red lines when the source is infected_ pussing_ nasty - not when it's just red. So I think he over-prescribed me.

365, 3, Post op infection,I am a PA who works in ER- use Bactrim all the time for my patients with Skin infections as CA MRSA is nearly always the cause- I started using this medicine and about 24 hrs after starting med noticed I would get pretty uncomfortable headaches with some migraine qualities (mild photophobia) but nothing severe.  Enough to take a gram of APAP and that was enough to keep it from being painful_ though not completely gone.  I also noticed a very slight ringing in my ears.  I have no allergies to meds and have taken many other antibiotics without a problem.  I also never get headaches_ so I can only assume the Bactrim must be the cause_ though no way to tell for sure.,While Bactrim is an important antibiotic in our tool belt due to CA MRSA being resistant to all but a few outpatient antibiotics_ I will likely choose a different one in the future to avoid HA's.  Bactrim is one of the drugs most prone to allergic reactions_ some serious- however I still choose to put pt's on it nearly first line for abscess/MRSA considering how sick pt's can get if not treated appropriately and they become septic,M,34,2  days240mg 2X D,11/26/2012,Bactrim

Days 1-3 I didn't really feel any side effects but wasn't getting much relief from my UTI. On the night of day 4_ I started to get anxious for no reason. My anxiety escalated into a full blown panic attack (which I've never had before...so scary!) I was crying non-stop_ hyperventilating_ felt detached from my body and the world. I was getting nausea from the anxiety and throwing up. Couldn't find joy in any situation. I thought I was going crazy and needed professional help.  My family was extremely worried as this is NOT my normal behavior. I stopped taking the drug immediately_ even though I still have another couple days worth. I have been drinking water to try and flush my system and because I'm SO thirsty. I've also just developed white patches all over my tongue.

I'm on day 7 now_ and while I don't think the side effect is worsening_ per se_ it's caused a lot of mental distress.I hope the side-effects go away relatively quickly.

I was having a little difficulty breathing to start with from the CF because of resistant bacteria . This drug is my only option as far as antibiotics  go. So I pretty much will have to stick it out as long as I can. I was glad to find that what I was experiencing with the pulmonary issues  was  a side effect of the bactrim. I was freaking out because I thought it wasn't doing anything  to the bacteria. I have made sure that I have had a large meal each time I take the bactrim and it has helped a lot with the stomach issue. And you have to drink a lot of water with this drug  . If not I had cotton mouth all the time .,F,47,2  weeks1600mg 2X D,7/11/2012Email,Bactrim

413, 1, UTI,I was prescribed Bactrim DS for a UTI 2 yrs ago. I took the first pill and within 20 min of taking I began to experience horrible vaginal itching and burning. I then took a Diflucan_ thinking it was a yeast infection(which antibiotics tend to give me). Well it wasn't. I continued taking the Bactrim for the next day. The pain and itching were almost unbearable. I had to hold an ice pack between my legs just to not be completely out of my mind. I didn't sleep at all for the second night in a row. I called my dr on the 3rd day and she switched my antibiotic. After 2 more weeks of this_ I finally went to be checked_ realizing if it were a yeast infection that it should be gone by now. A different dr examined me_ mistaking my symptoms for genital herpes. I had a blood test done to verify_ and she prescribed me herpes meds. Turns out it was NOT herpes(thank God)_ but a reaction to Bactrim.The skin inside my vagina and even outside was raw.Take the worst yeast infection ever and times it by 5,Horrible drug!,F,28,2  days 3X D,6/8/2012,Bactrim

Within a few hours of the first dose I had a headache that was nearly as intense as a migraine_ nausea_ loss of appetite.  Called doc_ they told me to stop it_ and are probably not prescribing anything else_ as my blood work and urine looked clear after two days of being on it.  Waiting for blood culture just to make sure. So....it attacked and stopped the growth of the bacteria within two days_ but I was not even able to last three full days on it.

The fatigue was accompanied by a severe brain fog that made me feel retarded and unable to think (like a zombie).  I also had a general sensation of weakness throughout my body.  The weakness was mild.  Bactrim also made me feel nauseous and lose my appetite occasionally.  The nausea and appetite loss were not constant_ they were off and on.Additionally I did have some shaking/tremors during the worst of it_ but I think that was my anxiety about how bad I was feeling.  I have a panic/anxiety condition that is usually under control.Within days of taking this drug the burning in my prostate subsided_ so it did what it was supposed to do.(I am still on Bactrim.

(turns out there was no infection_ and just had the cyst removed).  Took two horse pills per day for 6 days and then four pills per day once the fevers began (for 3 days).  The Dr figured my fevers were due to the infection being too strong for the dosage so he bumped it up_ only to make things worse.  Needless to say they have finally confirmed there is no infection and advised me to stop taking the Bactrim.  Its only been 24 hours_ and I have seen no signs of improvement yet.

I've taken Bactrim several times over the past 10 years for recurring UTI.,"It's a great drug for MRSA and UTI's. However_ as with ALL medications_ some people are allergic. The comments on here that say things like ""Had hives! Will never take this drug again! It's bad!"" make me laugh_ because_ look_ if you have hives_ you're allergic to it_ so NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND would prescribe it to you again. I mean_ that's like saying penicillin is a horrible horrible drug just because I'm allergic. Don't be stupid.

Two weeks later_ really bad itching started_ but with no rash present and no fever.  Then I got so sick I  couldn't keep water down.  Had light stools_ dark urine_ all signs of liver problems. Ended up going to Urgent Care and they said the UTI was still present_ so gave me Cipro for that. My Dr. ran blood tests for Hepatitis which was negative but the liver function tests were sky high. Sent me for an Ultrasound of the liver_ then off to a GI Dr. He thought it was some kind of virus that affected my liver and the function tests are getting back to normal. Finally getting back to normal_ although now I have some weird looking red splotches on both my legs_ although they don't itch.  From what I read_ you can have reoccuring symptoms from this HORRIBLE drug for months afterwards.

By Monday_ I called my doctor and explained that I was fatigued_ anxious_ had chills_ my muscles ached_ felt extremely bloated_ gassy and itchy. Their solution was to add probiotics to my regimen (which I had already been doing). They told me to drink a lot of water and eat a heavier/fattier meal. Really? I was doing what I could to make my self eat. I must have looked like death because people asked what was wrong. That Tuesday_ I went back to my doctor and she took me off the medicine and drew blood. Blood count came back normal but she still insisted that I just rest and not run. By Thursday_ I had diarrhea along with all the other symptoms. I ran a half marathon on Sunday and felt miserable when it was all said and done. I had an incredible amount of gas and pressure in my stomach. I could not eat or drink anything. I had to sit down because I felt out of breath_ weak_ dizzy and as if I was going to faint.

But I attributed this to a fight I had with a friend earlier in the evening and thought it was just stress... Monday I had a terrible headache with nausea and left work early... Tylenol cured the headache and Monday night I took an Ambien and slept like a baby... Tuesday night I didn't get to sleep until after 1:30am_ and Wednesday (last) night I didn't sleep AT ALL_ was restless and anxious all night and my heart kept beating really fast even though I had not done any strenous activity. Tonight I'm taking a Tylenol PM and tomorrow is my last day on the medication so hopefully the insomnia will get better by Saturday night.,This drug was okay. I was given it because I was peeing a lot and my Doctor thought I might have a mild bladder infection.

So the doctor gave me Bactrim for 7 days. The pharmisist said take with lots of water_ try and avoid the sun (we were at the beach in the outer banks...)and off we went.  The second pill I took was in the morning before I had breakfast the next day.  I felt about ready to puke for two hours.  Then I had a headache constantly the rest of the trip_ and got sunburned no matter how much sunscreen I put on.  Anyway yesterday was my last dose.  I felt a little better a few days ago but today the urge to urinate is awful. Not sure if the medicine worked or not. Maybe I'm not used to having antibiotics other than Z packs for sinus and ear infections but this seemed like a doozy.  I'm hoping this infection gets kicked.

I was supposed to take Bactrim 2x/day for 10 days_ but by day 5 (today)_ I can't walk up 10 stairs without feeling like I can't catch breath & my muscles feel super-fatigued. What makes it worse is that I am a distance runner - major distance_ and usually in great shape aerobically. I've had to stop repeatedly during every run I've tried to take over past week - didn't even try today! Because of the shortness-of-breath_ I haven't been able to finish my usual route at all_ and I have been super-sweaty too.

535, 1, UTI,Swollen Tongue_ Chest Pain_ Heart Palpitations_ Sweating_ Insomnia_ Rapid Changes in Blood Sugar_ Muscle Fatigue_ Joint Pain_ Lightheaded_ Tremors_ Depression,I was prescribed Bactrim for a UTI in April 2011.  After taking the first pill I experienced flu like symptoms (nausea_ fatigue_ fever_ lightheaded_ etc).  I was not terribly concerned as I figured maybe the infection was getting worse before getting better.  The next morning I took 1/3 of the pill to see if I could stomach that a little better.  Five minutes after taking the pill I wanted to vomit.  I never did and about an hour later my heart felt like it was going to beat out my chest and my tongue swelled up.  I have had multiple hospital visits since April and am still suffering.  I have found symptoms worsen after every time I eat or drink.  I am now on a limited organic diet as IBS seems to have created food allergies.  I continue to have a swollen tongue_ white film covering tongue_ insomnia_ lightheaded episodes_ depression_ and occasional convulsions.  I do not know if this drug has caused me permanent damage or if my body is still trying to metabolise it and I continue to get symptoms as it passes through my system.  I wish I had known the danger before taking this medication.  It is a dangerous pill with serious consequences.  My heart goes out to all those suffering after taking this awful drug.  I can only pray that maybe it is still in our system and some day the symptoms will disappear before too much damage is done.

550, 3, UTI,I've had 2 UTI this year after never having one before. The first one I went to the doctor and was prescribed bactrim. It cleared up the UTI after a 3 day course. 7 months later I got another UTI but got a 5 day course of bactrim for free and started taking it. By day 2 I had extreme nausea_ felt flushed and a little short of breath. This med is supposed to be taken with food but I could barely eat anything. Continued onto the third day feeling extremely sick. After looking around on the Internet I took an over the counter allergy medicine (psuedoephidrine) The effect was almost immediate. Within 15 minutes the neausea had gone down considerably and in another 15 minutes I felt so much better that I ate the first decent meal I had had in 3 days. I have stopped taking it and won't finish the last 2 days and just hope the UTI is gone and drink cranberry juice. I thought it was weird that i had such a bad reaction the second time around but see from this site that this has happened to others,I will never take this drug again. After this experience my aunt told me she can't take sulfa drugs and neither could my grandmother. The best advice I can give is to take benadryl ( allergy meds ) it worked really fast to relieve my symptoms.,F,34,3  days 2X D,6/26/2011Email,Bactrim

Still experiencing some of those symptoms a week and a half after being off the drug!,The drug cured my middle ear infection most likely_ but it is debateable that it was worth the side effects that I am still suffering from a week and a half after going off the drug.  I've been on penicillin and amoxycillin before without any severe adverse effects especially the mind altering effects.  I would only recommend this drug as a last resort drug or if the infection is so bad to risk your life if you didn't take it.  It is possible the drug killed the beneficial bacteria in my digestive track leading to the spread of fungus internally that could explain the oral thrush and mind altering affects and I need to return my body to a balance.,M,41,8  days480 MG 2X D,6/12/2011,Bactrim

I did get a 2nd opinion and that dr. couldn't understand why Bactrim was even prescribed.  He said it such an old medicine and there is much better on the market.

634, 3, post transplant PCP prevention,This medication was effective for its purpose...I rarely got Pneumonia in the 17 post transplant years that I was on the drug. Long story short_ my doctors are on the brink of diagnosing me with drug induced lupus. I was ordered off the Bactrim after some alarming auto-immunity tests were run. Among the many positive test results were an ANA_ DsDNA_ and anti histone abs as well as the inflammation markers: westergren sed rate and c-reactive protein. Tests will be rerun in a few months to confirm the diagnosis. I will never take another sulfa drug again. I thought this drug was safe for me because I've been on it for so long_ but I got a rude awakening into the reality of long term side effects. I was very lucky in that Lupus is treated with immunosuppressants and I was on said drugs for my transplant.

646, 1, Post operation to prevent infection,Severe muscle cramps and pain all over my body. The muscle cramps were in my hamstrings and calves and also in my upper arm area. I still can not lift my arms above my shoulder and it's been two days. Severe headache especially at the base of my neck. Neck was very stiff_ could not turn it. My eyes were bloodshot red. My jaw was ears hurt terribly. I had no appetite at all. I had diarrhea once. I had the chills all day_ going from being hot to very cold. Could not sleep at all for two nights after taking just one pill. Still recovering two days later.,I took this drug in early November and had no adverse reaction at all...just minor headache. Then I took it again in December prior to an operation I was scheduled to have a week later. I took just one pill and the side effects kicked in to full swing. My symptoms at that time were severe body aches_ headaches and chills. No fever_ rash or vomiting. When I told my doctor my symptoms she just brushed it off and said I most likely had the flu!! I trusted her opinion (my mistake) and after my operation she asked me to get back on Bactrim again to make sure I did not get a post operation infection. I was a bit reluctant but trusted her opinion and went ahead with it. After taking just one pill_ I went downhill within an hour and landed in the emergency room. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. One thing to keep in mind is that you may be fine taking this drug the first time but it could get you the next time and the side effects should not be taken lightly. They are potentially fatal. It's been two days now since taking only one pill and my body is still fighting hard to get better. Still getting severe cramping in my calves and upper arms. Also_ I have no appetite and am still getting headaches and dizziness. I've been drinking a lot of fluids to flush out this medication and have become good friends with my hot water bag. Really helps with the chills.,F,44,1  days 2X D,12/16/2010,Bactrim
647, 1, UTI,Severe muscle aches behind my thighs_ knees_ calves_ and arms. Persistent numbness in my fingers. Extreme sharp headaches. High fever of a 102. Swollen face and lips. Dizziness. Inability to stand for more than 5 seconds. Liquid discharge from the eyes. Chills and overall body aches.,I took this medication for my UTI just before dinner within 5 hours I developed a very high fever_ chills and muscle aches. I had sharp headaches that felt like a knife that attacked in the same spot behind and front side of my head. I began to take extra strength Tylenol every two hours for the fever and headaches. This helped keep the fever down but not the headaches. As soon as the three hour mark hit the fever would shoot up. Thinking it was just the flu I went to work in the morning. I did not take the second dose because I was under some other medications for other reasons and did not want to take them closely together_ so I intended to space them apart by 2 hours. When I woke up my face and lips were swollen and my skin was flushed. By 9 a.m. I began getting a strong pain behind my legs to the point I had to keep them moving in order to stay standing. It increasingly got worse that even if I moved I still felt like my legs would give out and I would fall. By 11:30 a.m. I had to go back to the clinic. I was in extreme pain_ my fever and headaches continued and I had an overall terrible feeling that something was very wrong. I tried to describe my pain to the doctor that I had never felt these types of pain in my legs before so she ordered an ultrasound to my legs. But found nothing. The doctor consulted an allergist and another doctor and gave them a list of my medications. They all concurred that my symptoms sounded like it was due to the sulfameth+trimeth (Bactrim).

I called the MD's office and MD told me it was either from my infection or possibly allergic reaction. MD told me to go to bed and call in the AM and she could give me prednisone. 15 minutes after I hung up I got terrible chills and felt very worried. I went to ER. The ER gave me a breathing treatment_ they said my lungs sounded weak_ tylenol and Benadryl. After I got home from the ER at 5:00AM I could not sleep_ I had a terrible feeling of dread and doom. I keep thinking I was going to die and thought I might have a terrible disease. I was freezing and sweating at the same time. I was up for the rest of the morning_ NO SL,I have stopped the Bactrim for 2 days now. (9 out of 10 days). I still have the rash and now it itches. The bottoms of my feet itch. I have blurry vision.

On Day 8 (yesterday) I started feeling itchy_ but thought it was just dry skin from the weather so took my last dose at 10pm.  Then this morning I woke up at 4am with what I think was the beginning of anaphylaxis.  I was choking & it felt like I couldn't clear the saliva or congestion seeping into my airway_ my voice was hoarse_ throat glands were swollen.  I thought about taking Mucinex_ but got online to see it was symptoms of anaphylaxis.  Then when I looked in the mirror_ my tongue wasn't swollen_ but I had hives on my upper chest.  I took a benadryl and it cleared up the breathing/swallowing difficulties_ mucus_ and swollen glands started going down in 15-20min_ hives disappears after 2 hours... so it WAS some type of allergic rxn.  Not 100% sure if anaphylaxis is due to them medication since it didn't happen on the first day_ but yesterday was the first night I didn't take the benadryl with it befo,Infection at operation site has greatly improved but not 100% clear yet_ as of day 8.  Nausea_ diarrhea_ & loss of appetite was expected with antibiotics.  Taking with a substantial meals_ lessens the nausea.  The Physician's Assistant told me to keep taking it even thought I had an allergic reaction b/c he thinks it was something else other than the antibiotic.  Was taking benadryl for the insomnia side effect_ so maybe it was masking the allergic reaction.

I began Bactrim (a.k.a. Septra) on Nov. 5. Today is Nov. 11. I've only had ONE bowel movement in all that time! And it was 3-4 days ago_ so I'm getting really bloated & uncomfortable & cranky. :( I'm normally VERY regular_ so this is VERY abnormal for me! Note: the 800/160 refers to 800 MG sulfamethoxazole & 160 MG trimethoprim. I've been on it for 7 days but am not done; it's a 10-day prescription.,"Even more disturbing is all the home/natural remedies I've been using that SHOULD help_ but AREN'T (at least not yet)!! These include: probiotic supplements (to replenish the ""beneficial bacteria"" in my gut that the antibiotics are killing); drinking tons of extra fluids - mainly water_ vitamin water & milk; drinking HOT water with a bit of lemon; increasing my fiber intake (especially prunes_ salad greens & raw carrots); increasing how much I exercise; and wearing ThermaCare heat patches on my lower abdominal area. I finally broke down & called an advice nurse who recommended Senokot gentle laxative/stool softener pills or Milk of Magnesia. Will try Senokot first.

Continually got worse_ so doc said to discontinue until they went away and start back whenever it was cleared up. Took about 3 weeks to go away completely. Took 1 tablet and about 2 hours later felt worse than I had in my entire life_ like I had a flu on steroids. If I hadn't left work when I did I don't believe I would have been able to drive home. Once I got home almost passed out_ and just laid in bed. Had to have someone help me get up to go to the bathroom and would frequently have to sit up to be able to breath. Went to doctor_ they said I must be allergic to sulfa drugs and gave me a steriod shot. Within an hour_ I felt much better. about a month later I went to the doctor about a sore throat that would not go away. They did some blood tests and found that I was extremely anemic_ almost enough to where I needed a blood transfusion. I have given blood at least 2 times a year for the last 3 years and never had an anemia problem. Read up more about bactrim and anemia is one of the side effects.

705, 1, Prevent urinary tract infections,"After unsuccessfully treating/preventing chronic bladder infections the doc decided to give me bactrim.  The first time I took it I developed a huge ulcer on the left inside corner of my mouth that caused the whole right side of my mouth and the outside of my cheek at the lip line to swell_ burn_ and sort of itch.  Worse than a cold sore and inside my mouth. NOTHING worked to make it feel better.  Even water made it burn.  I only have to take one pill when I feel the early symptoms of UTI so the first time I didn't connect the medicine and the reaction.  I did get what I thought was a yeast infection that would NOT go away even with prescription from doc.  A month or so later when I finally got rid of the ulcer and the ""yeast infection"" I had more UTI symptoms so I took another Bactrim.  Within 20 minutes I got the swelling/burning in my mouth again_ developed another ulcer in my mouth within hours_ and immediately felt like I had a yeast infection again. I now know it is/was",I do not recommend this medication to anyone_ even if you don't think you're allergic.  I've noticed that the reaction time varies so widely from minutes up to 10 days that it's not worth the risk.  I can't imagine what it's doing inside our bodies that we don't notice before it's caused serious problems on the outside!

Day #1: Took first pill in the AM and within 20 minutes felt EXTREMELY sick to my stomach.

I was out of town working so went to Urgent Care and was told I was allergic to the Bactrim (Sulfa drugs). They also found blood in my urine and said I might be getting a urinary tract or bladder infection. Went home to my Dr. who prescribed Prednisone and did not agree w/ bladder infection(found no blood in urine on day 11) diagnosis since Bactrim treats that and I had completed 9 days of Bactrim.

And I also drink a lot. However last winter I had a UTI and I did notice more anxiety and shakiness. It was right around holiday time so I was drinking a lot and holidays are a bit stressful so hard to say if it was the bactrim plus alchohol or what. probably a combo of everything. Anyway Ive never really had any probelms with it and Im suprised to hear so many people have. I always though of it as fairly benign. however_ I have a mild UTI and took day one yesterday when i realized Im supposed to avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight. Im departing on a 7 day boat cruise where I will be in the sun constantly. Its hard enough to stauy hydrated and remember to put sun screen on as it is_ so I think I will take my chances and skip the bactrim_ There is some over the counter stuff that has helped me when I have had UTIs  before (cystex) and you can also get high doese of whatever it is in cranberry juice that promotes urinary tract health.

733, 1, MRSA Infection on leg,I was taking Bactrim for a MRSA (Staph aureus) infection on my leg.  This was combined with Clindamycin 4x daily. The first 24 hrs I experienced intense headaches; night sweats and need to urinate at night.  Day 5_ I suffered my first-ever anxiety attack that lasted for two hours. On day nine_ I started to itch on my lower left ankle and my body became warm.  I woke the next morning with a full body rash_ swollen lower left foot; very dark rash on my left leg around the wound.  Apparently the allergic reaction starts at the area closest to the wound.  The next day the rash was more intense on my right leg.  My face bloated and my lips were on fire.  The ears itched.  My fingers swelled. Avoid sun!  One week later_ the rash has almost disappeared except for some discoloration around my legs and  what looks like broken capillaries on my eyelids.  I still have morning diarrhea probably caused by the Clindamycin that destroys good bacteria in the intestine.  T,The side effects of this drug are numerous and dangerous.  My doctor did not explain all the effects_ so be wary for headaches_ night sweats_ weird dreams_ anxiety_ itching followed by a 7-10 day full body rash.  Benedryl and Claritin did not relieve the symptoms of the rash.  Be sure to avoid the sun if you are on Bactrim or have a rash!,M,48,10  days 2X D,8/9/2010,Bactrim

744, 1, UTI,I self medicated this for a possible UTI. I initially tried this and used extremely small doses(1/10 or so) to see any possible reactions. Symptoms I had was feeling like my blood was boiling_ heart palpitations_ issues sleeping_ and possibly high blood pressure. I after a few days I quit taking them and the effects subsided rather quickly. A year or so later I tried it again and this time I had the blood tingling like feeling the first time and after that everything seemed fine and I felt better than I have in many years.  I'm on my 5th day and have started taking the recommended dosage. I have noticed that I feel slightly lethargic and my eyes don't seem to focus quickly as I would like. I still have slight issues with sleep but it's about 100 times better than the first time I tried. I do have a stiff neck but it may be from other things.I may get off the medication because many people seem to experience major problems towards the end of their treatment(5-10 days).,When I initially started the second time I drank a lot of water(about 10 8oz glasses a day) and this may be the key to reducing the side effects. The last 2 days I have gradually reduced the water intake and the symptoms seemed to increase.I can't explain why I initially had such a strong reaction to it but the second time was much much better and actually endurable. The drug does seem to have a pretty strong effect but the side effects are the issue.  This is the only thing that worries me and self-medicating with an anti-biotic is not a great thing to quit treatment in the middle.  I will probably gradually reduce the dosage just in case so my system won't have as high as a concentration(3day half life).I give it a 1 only because of the issues with the side effects. If you don't have side effects then this could be a great drug. But note some people have life-threatening problems with this drug even after initially not having any problems.If there are other non-sulfa drugs that are just as effective then I would recommend one try those first and try this drug as only a last resort unless you know for sure that you won't have an adverse reaction to it.,M,30, 400mg 1X D,7/26/2010,Bactrim

771, 5, UTI,GI symptoms - stomacheaches_ bloating_ constipation_ gasYeast infectionPositive - decreased acne.,People_ if you have an allergic reaction to a drug_ that is not a problem with the drug_ and does not warrant alarmist cries about how dangerous the drug is and how the FDA should take it off the market.  It's possible to develop an allergic reaction to just about anything...even your own body. If you experience throat swelling_ itching_ hives_ or other signs of allergy while taking a drug_ you should stop taking it immediately. I have recurring UTIs and developed an allergic reaction to Macrobid_ and this was the alternative drug my doctor prescribed.  I'm very happy with it.  My symptoms subside within 12 hours after taking the first dose.  I try to take these for less than the recommended 10 days (5-8) and then hit the cranberry tablets and vitamins hard and try to stave off a recurrence that way.  Reading online testimonials_ I've gotten the impression that allergic reactions tend to happen around 9-10 days of treatment.  My theory is that metabolites accumulate and maybe trigger the immune system_ especially if you don't drink enough water.  Not sure this is correct_ but I do know that if I take this long enough I will get a yeast infection_ and I develop GI symptoms from killing off the bacteria there_ so there's another good reason not to take it the full 10 days.  My GI symptoms include severe bloating after eating ANYTHING_ as well as gas and constipation_ lasting for weeks.

Just because you have an allergic reaction to a drug_ doesn't mean it should be taken off the market.

Others would take a month to work and then fail aftewords. This was very stable. Highly recommend. Of course after reading the reviews here_ one has to be careful and vigilant for any side effets. At least comparing too accutance which is another option for serious acnes has life long side effects_ this drug does not have any life long side effects as I know of.By the way one doctor did refused to give me Bactrim for acne.

Seems to be clearing up the infection of my prostate. The problem with antibiotic for prostate issues are that there are only a few that can actually penetrate the prostate tissue and work.  All of them have side effects some worst than others. I was on Cipro before taking the Bactrim. Cipro is IMO is poisonous antibiotic and should be discontinued. I had many bad side effect from Cipro.  So if you want to clear up and infection more than likely you will need antibiotics. If one does work another may work.  Everyone that had a bad experience with this drug is still a small percentage of the population that takes it.  Also alternative antibiotics for infections may not be any better.

835, 1, UTI,Why is this drug not banned? It is horrible! I have never been allergic to anything in my life and have had antibiotics for UTIs before and never experienced anything like this. My UTI was very mild_ almost non-existant_ but didn't totally go away with my usual cranberry treatment. After pill #1_ my legs started shaking_ lower back pain_ insomnia_ anxiety_ racing heart. I didn't sleep at all that first night because I was terrified. Called to talk to nurse the next day and she said that the lower back pain was the bacteria moving to my kidney - take more! I took my 2nd dose 12 hours from the first one and than she wanted me to take another one only 5 hours after. 2nd pill had similar symptom to 1st one and than after the 3rd pill my face started swelling up! I tried to call and of course the clinic was closed for the day. Call around to other places they said I should go to the ER. After reading online_ I decided to wait and see what happened. Swelling went down after 9 hours and than,Even though the Bactrim was gone from my body_ the allergic reaction still takes time to go away. This is the first time I ever had anything like this happen to me and it scared me to death. I still get sad thinking about it. I guess I am mostly healed but somehow I don't feel totally like I did before the Bactrim experience. It has been 12 days since I stopped and I still have sore muscles in my back off and on and a sometimes numbish feeling in my face and dry tongue when I wake up. I just want to be back to my normal self. It gets me worried. Esp. since I have no insurance so i can't be running to the doctor all the time. Thankfully I have a doctor friend who gives me a little free advice. Please don't ever take this! It is horrible and I wish they would ban it. It is banned in other countries.

I had a fever all of a sudden but attributed it to the sinus infection. On day 2 I barely did any work (WHICH IS RARE BECAUSE i AM IN COMMISION ONLY SALES). The 2nd day I woke up and was very irritable. I would describe it as uncontrolled anger. It was very odd and disturbing and my friends recognized it immediatly.I also started shaking very bad and felt disoriented and dizzy. That afternoon I was laying down to take a nap and my heart started to race and I felt as though i was having a panic attack. It is hard to describe how awkward and uncomfotable I felt. I started wondering what was different in my routine. It dawned on me it could be the Bactrim. I looked online and found this website. THANK GOD!,I have stopped taking the Bactrim. My sinus infection is still there but I can deal with it. I have not taken Bactrim for a full day and I still feel very unmotivated and panic like.

By Wednesday morning_ I was feeling feverish and weak. Chalking it up to the infected belly button_ I rested. By evening_ I was so dizzy and nauseous_ I was convinced I had the flu. My belly hurt_ my head pounded_ and my joints ached. I had a medical school interview the next day and in an attempt to rid myself of the terrible symptoms_ I discontinued the Biaxin and Bactrim. After contacting our pharmacist_ he was shocked my PCP prescribed both to be taken at the same time because both can cause such violent side effects.

I'm really disappointed that I may have to go off this medicine_ after MANY failed attempts this is the only one that is on its way to clearing up my painful facial cystic acne. Also have constipation_ stomach cramping and some nausea. I'm sure glad I ran into this site. It helped me confirm what I was dreading.,,F,28,11  days,12/27/2009,Bactrim

I've been off the Bactrim for 2 days now_ and I still have the rash_ altho it is better than it had been..and I have pain in my ankles_ on and off_ loss of appetite_ trouble sleeping and concentrating on things_ and an overall feeling of not being well.  This is the first time I've taken Bactrim_ and definitely the last.  I am currently taking Benadryl and prednisone_ which I'll be on for the next few more days.  I'm so very concerned with whether or not I've done some permanant damage to my body and so very sorry I did not research this antibiotic before taking it.  I feel Bactrim is not at all safe_ and am just praying I recover fully from it's effects on me.,Should not be prescribed to anyone.  It is a dangerous antibiotic.,F,48,7  days,12/23/2009Email,Bactrim

I was on it for 9 days and day 6 is when the symptoms started. I had sever chills and fever followed by sweats and burning pain growing in my arms. Started in left forearm_ moved up to include tricep_ then mirrored to right arm and both moved up to the upper shoulders and neck. My arms were cramping so bad I could not sign into the ER which is where I wound up. After 2 units of fluid and 4 doses of Diloden which did not dull the pain at all_ I was dismissed as ""probably got a virus"" since urine & bloodwork was all normal. Rather p-o'd that they didn't ask more questions or seem interested in my medications. They didn't blink when I told them I was on Septra...Initially_ we didn't have any indication of allergy as I'm not allergic to any medications I can think of. I've been off it for 10 days and I'm left with thumbs that can't bend inward and right index finger that won't bend at the last joint. I can't pick up things like paper or pens and have been reduced to holding glasses and such with 2 hands like a toddler so I don't drop them. I'm normally very healthy and only see a doctor every 5-6 years for physicals and non-health issues. The weakness is terrible as I make a living using my hands. The weird thing is the parts of the fingers affected are only the last joints_ tip of finger and joint of the thumb.

I took some probiotics to try to restore healthy flora to my GI tact.  It feels like the majority of the remainder is in my head_ causing headaches.

After stopping it for almost two weeks now the episodes have become less severe_ but I still feel the symptoms pretty strongly_ although not as strong as when I was still taking it.

Anyway_ took the first pill at night_ woke up with a sore throat_ didn't think much of it_ took the second pill. In the next few hours_ sore throat got much worse_ face started to turn red (not a rash_ just red). Went back and read the package insert_ which mentions sore throat_ so I called the doctor and pharmacist_ and they told me to stop taking it immediately and start taking Benedryl_ since I was having an allergic reaction_ and there was the possibility my throat would swell and close. I stopped taking it_ but my body was still mounting a massive response to it. It was as though I had the flu - very bad sore throat_ congested_ achy all over_ chills (with the worst of it kicking in a day after I stopped taking it).

I stopped taking it on day 4 and was back to normal that night. I called my doctor to tell her about my side effects and she didn't comment_ just prescribed another antibiotic (I've since switched doctors).

Then on the 8th day the rash had increased to torso_ arms and upper legs and he feels eye pain in the right eye when he looks to one side.  I called the doctor and we stopped the medication.  We are on vacation away from home in a far off state.  Needless to say_ he's not enjoying himself.  I went to the drugstore and bought benadryl and hydrocortizone for his skin per the doctor.  He took an oatmeal bath to soothe the itch.  I'm praying that he awakes this morning minus the rash and minus the eye pain and is back to being his healthy self.,My son had never taken bactrim and we had no idea he was allergic.  I think doctors should describe the possible side effects before prescribing such a strong drug (for what appeared to be way more than my son needed for his condition).

Time will tell.  No major side effects for the first 4 days; symptoms report in order of which they occurred.  On day 5 the muscle pain started (may have been amplified by doing yard work and raking during that day).  The muscle aches and pains are pretty severe and I don't really feel like doing much.  If I use my hands a lot they hurt (just the thumb muscle).  I am dazed and confused and at night have to take Xanax in order to prevent panic attacks.  I have 3 days to go and am looking forward to the end of this ""experience.""  I suppose I would take it again if it does cure my infection_ but alternatives might be better for me.",M,29,10  days,5/25/2009,Bactrim

They said to stop taking the medicine_ and I made an appointment for this afternoon.  Upon going_ we made note that I'm allergic to it (obviously_ now...) and I got a shot that's supposed to help with the itching and inflammation.  So far it's not helping_ but I'm hoping it will within the next 24-48 hours_ or I'll be miserably itchy and uncomfortable.,F,26,10  days,5/14/2009,Bactrim
978, 5, MRSA,Rash_ metallic taste_ sun sensitive_ insomnia_and decreased appitete.,I have had reoccurant MRSA infections for about a year not bad cases just enough to be miserable. The key thing when taking this is make sure your not allergic to sulfur based medication and you stay out of the sun. Wear sunblock when you go out. Drink water.I have been on this medication per episode of MRSA anywhere from 10 to 30 days. (30 was during the first case) Now they only have to put me on it for 10days. It works. I am very concerned about those that stop taking it without doctor supervison becuase that is what makes super bugs like MRSA more deadly.

My doctor switched me to Bactrim_ but did not mention any side effects. The hot flashes and night sweats started the second day of use_ but were more annoying than a real problem.  The hives started after five days.  I thought I had been attacked by a swarm of mosquitoes_ but they were showing up where no mosquito could get to. I later found out they were hives.  They would show up thirty minutes after taking the pill_ and would disappear about four hours later.  Again_ more annoying than a problem.  The itchy skin was constant_ like a mild sunburn.

The side effects were tolerable. My doctor hates it that I turn up my nose at all the other antibiotics and will only take this one. Most of the bad posts here were alergic reactions.

The day after she started taking the medicine she had a fever of over 104_ severe leg pain_ burning eyes_ nausea and vomiting_ rash_ dizziness and chills. We called the Dr. numerous times but he said it wasn't the meds. After three days of this we were convinced that it was the meds though. She could have easily been hospitalized. She was VERY sick!

Last time I took bactrim_ also to treat a several day gastrointestinal infection_ I developed the same symptoms.  Eventually welts developed_ the skin peeled off_ and it took about 5 weeks for the wounds to heal.  At the time_ doctors told me it was a fungal infection_ and was treated for it as such with antimycotic skin ointments.

She said this medicine is generally give to people with UTI's and that is has a ""bone marrow suppression"" side effect_ which_ after several trips and drawn blood_ is what made my son's clood cell and platelet count so low.

HOWEVER_ I DISCOVERED A WAY TO LESSEN THE EFFECTS....................This lessened the symptoms tremendously. Break pills in half and spread it out throughout the day. My original prescription was 1 tablet/morn_ 1 tablet/evening for a total of 3 days. I could feel the dizziness overtake me 30min after taking the pill_ I swore I would never take another one but by evening I was feeling fine and reasoned that the side effects only lasted about 6 hours _ why not try again. Finally day 3_ I cut the 2 tablets in half and took 1/2 every 3 hours. This kept the extremes of the side effects at bay. I just felt a mild warmth to the skin_ which was OK to put up with. I read where this spread-out dosage is usually  recommended for children. It worked best for this adult best too! as well.,F,49,3  days,4/12/2009Email,Bactrim

Fever got as high as 101.8. Had to lie down on floor of bldg entrance when waiting for kid to come home on school bus. Was only able to function (thinking_ eating_ shopping_ computer_ but no exercise - too weak) by alternating Tylenol and Motrin round the clock as told by doc_ sometimes letting it wear off to see how high fever would get. I was very worried that I had septicemia but docs said if infection,I am usually extremely active and haven't been able to do anything for last 4 days. Hope to get over this med ASAP and will try to eat probiotic (yuck) yogurt as recommended by some_ and will try drinking a lot to flush it out.

My husband ran out to get me some Excedrin Migrane and that took the headache away but I am still feeling extremely weak_ my hands are shaking and I feel like I am going to throw up. I would not recommend this medicine to anyone and I believe that it should be either taken off of the market or used for extreme infections that do not respond to any other antibiotic instead of thrown at paitents for the smallest thing.

Dah! I took it several years ago for a bladder infection and it worked very well_ so I trusted it_ but after the side effects_ it seems that by now they have changed the formulation to cope with the new more resistant bacteria and so this causes all these nasty side effects.  This is from the family of the strongest antibiotics and traditionally they cause upset stomach.  Take with food perhaps.

I was prescribed 1 pill twice a day for 7 days (after a culture determined that 7 Day Levaquin regimin I had just endured was ineffective as the bacteria was Levaquin resistant!).  I don't know if the UTI has improved because my symptoms weren't noticeable to begin with (only blood in the urine for a couple hours) -- I'll find out shortly.  Sinus infection slightly better but it's a tough one.  I am allergic to several classes of antibiotics so I don't have tons of options.  I think I'd be okay taking this again if I had to -- beats winding up in the emergency room with a true allergic reaction.,F,46,7  days,2/11/2009,Bactrim

Otherwise_ I couldn't have tolerated it any longer. It made me feel horrible! I've taken it before (lower dose) and it wasn't quite as bad.

And I woke up yesterday morning with the world's most painful yeast infection you could ever imagine and it's getting worse even though I started treating it right away. Every time I urinate I want to yell and cry. :(,This is some pretty horrible stuff. I would not recommend it to anyone. I only took a few of the pills in that bottle over the course of two days and I'll never take another one_ ever!

Dermatologist said keep taking it anyway.Kept calling because of concern of rash. She gave me high doses of Pregnisone----still rash_ even shakier. Called Doctor---said keep taking Bactrim. Finished meds. I still have rash. Saw another dermatologist--he said Doctor almost killed me snd thatI should have stopped immediately when I got the rash---he said he has seen people die from Bactrim and told me never to take it again---stressed again how Doctor was wrong to have me continue meds and how again she could have killed me. I talked to my pharmacist---he said he was concerned about rash as side effect--can cause Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. One week after finishing meds---I still have rash--I am miserable. I am very upset with the Doctor who told me to continue taking Bactrim no matter what! Watch out for this medication & bad doctors!!!

Days 1-3 I had the headaches_ couldn't eat or sleep and day 4 the back aches and fever started which brought me to this site (thank God!).  I went to the ER and was put on an IV and they did blood and urine tests.  I don't know why they didn't just listen to me from the beginning (probably because I'm not a doctor)_ I knew it was the Bacrim.  They tested to see if it was a UTI_ pregnancy (lol)_ etc.  Finally after 4 hours said I wasn't allergic to the Bactrim but I had the side effects due to the high dosage.

BINGO - I think I had every side effect listed!I called the doctor AGAIN and told them all of my side effects and that I had stopped taking that SATAN drug.

I would scratch but it wouldn't help and I would get this burning sensation on my face and hands... I couldn't even cry because it was really awful.

The next day_ I had severe heart palpitations and missed beats. I went back to the ER and asked again if it was the medication and was told no. I was told to keep taking it again. I felt terrible at this point. I went home and called my personal doctor and asked if the medication was causing this. He too told me it was not the medication and to keep taking it. He refused to make me an appointment to evaluate my condition and told me I was just freaking myself out. The next day I felt even worse and had the rash spread all over my arms and had unusual bruising. I went to the ER again and they said it was not the medication and to keep taking it.

1088, 1, UTI,Back pain_ dull pain behind eyelids_ chills/sweating_ dizziness_ itching_ cough_ yeast infection,I've never had allergies to any drugs but unfortunately I learned the hard way this time. I started taking Bactrim for a UTI on a Thursday. By Saturday_ the lower back pain started.  By Monday night chills set in.  Tuesday I was severely chilled for most of the day then broke out into sweats.  The eye pain began and I saw a different Dr. who told me she felt my back pain was a pinched nerve and the chills and eye ache due to sinuses and put me back on Bactrim for another 5 days. My gut told me this wasn't sinus related or a pinched nerve_ however_ I followed Drs orders but wish I had read up on this and seen this site sooner. I didn't make it to my last dose because during this second time I had waves of dizziness_ slept alot (when I wasn't tossing and turning from itching or back pain). Took ibuprofen for back pain and eye pain. Benadryl has no effect on the itching so far.  I am headed back to the dr. today.

I would lay there_ my heart feeling like it was going to pop out of my chest_ and these electric/tingly feelings shooting through my body.  It was horrible.  I never thought a simple antibiotic could do this do a person.  I'd never experienced a panic attack before.  I had about 2 or 3 a day while taking the bactrim.

Not fun.  I went to the doctor and was told not to finish the medication-thank God_ I had already quit taking it.

The second time I took it I didn't have the diarrhea but ended up with a horrible yeast infection again that refused to go away.,This drug works wonders for my skin_ it clears it up really fast without drying it. Overall I was very happy with how it made my skin look but I can't live with continuous yeast infections. I already seem to be very prone to them_ maybe that's why I get them with this drug_ but whenever I take this I can't seem to get rid of the infection as easily as normal. I would recommend it to others who suffer from acne (this is the only thing that actually works that good for me) but women who take it need to make sure that they are very careful in regards to the infections.

I have been off of the medication for two days and have not experienced any relief despite the use of Benadryl and Zyrtec. Bactrim DS did not treat my infection and it did not help with my acne either.  This is a dangerous drug.

Fever_ night sweats_ chills and swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck. Fitfull sleep and migraine-like headache.,I has just come off of a ten day prescription of Keflex which did not even touch my painfully swollen thumb. My internist referred me to a hand surgeon and after surgically lancing and draining my infected thumb he prescribed the Bactrim for ten days_ 800mg.twice a day. My rash appeared two days after finishing the Bactrim. The fever_ night sweats_ swollen lymph nodes and horrible headache began almost immediately after the first day of taking the Bactrim. Upon returning for post-op check_ the granuloma was bleeding profusely and still quite painful. Finally the surgeon used silver nitrate solution to cauterize the granuloma. He informed me the granuloma may return and I am to come in for treatment as needed. Fine_ but NO MORE BACTRIM!!,F,59,10  days,5/1/2008,Bactrim

Within 24 hrs of taking the first dose_ I experienced slight tremors_ and most distinctly Deafness! in both ears accompanied by a ringing or loud static noise in the head with a feeling as if the eardrums were swollen. Upon tapping the side of the head a feeling a numbness in the ears.  I also experienced Headache_ slight rare nausea_ alot of neck pain_ vivid far out dreams_ increased night sweats and insomnia but these could be from menopause so i disregard them.  The infection however is responding and healing and feels better. At this point I have been on the medication for 4 days of the prescribed 10 day period. The effects seem to increase over time and get worse as you take more of the script.,I intend to contact the physician today about the increasing side effects.

1186, 4, UTI,Bactrim does work!  But it caused unbearable headaches_ neckaches_ eye pain_ insomnia_ drug fevers_ chills_ depression_ nervousness_ and poor appitite.,It is unlikely I will ever take this drug again.  This is the first time I've ever experienced such side effects with any med.  I was Rxed this drug bc I had a very resistant and recurrent strain of bacteria that was unresponsive to other antibiotics in the past.  My UTI was asymptomatic.  My only sign was odd smelling urine.  I had to take two Ibuprophen to stay ahead of the side effects of Bactrim_ otherwise I would not be able to function.  I continued to use Bactrim only because other antibiotics have been unsuccessful at getting rid of this particular strain of bacteria.  Bactrim does work_ but.... if I had to do it all over again_ I honestly would have prefered dealing with my asymptomatic UTI than take this medication again.  I would only consider taking this again if it were a life or death situation.  Oh_ I do believe Bactrim has effectively cleared up my UTI_ but it's definitely cost me big time!!,F,33,8  days,4/29/2008,Bactrim

Sensitivity to light.  Felt extremely tired yet suffered insomnia and had nightmares.,I realize that all people process medicine differently_ and the side effects that I suffered could just be the result of how my body processed the Bactrim.  However_ there's not a medicine that I have not been able to tolerate in the past_ and about 2 hours after I took the first dose_ the side effects starting coming on.  I stopped after 5 days because I simply couldn't tolerate it anymore.  I was taking this with Augmentin 875 and thought maybe the two drugs together were causing the problems.  But_ I've had Augmentin many times before and never suffered anything like this.  My own personal reccommendation would be to stay as far away from Bactrim as possible.  There's a least 2 or 3 failsafe antibiotics behind Bactrim that will do the trick.,M,43,5  days,4/11/2008,Bactrim

However he told me that Bactrim rarely caused any side effects and that he was surprised I was having a reaction.

I started vomiting on day five (after nausea every day before that). My doctor prescribed a medicine for the vomiting that just makes me tired. I've missed a lot of work because of this drug. I'm supposed to continue it for another three days but there is NO WAY IN HELL I'm going to do that. I spent today at work running to the bathroom to throw up until I was well enough to drive myself home. What a nightmare.

1210, 1, Urinary Tract Infection,Last year_ I was diagnosed with a UTI.  The only other UTI I had was six years before_ and I took Bactrim with no problems so the doctor prescribed it to me agian.  Took one pill_ seemed okay; took another one before bed and woke up feeling achy all over and wasn't sure if it was the Bactrim so took another when I woke up and another around 1 p.m.; by 3 p.m. I was in a meeting and started to feel lightheaded and really f***ed up and told my boss I needed to go home.  Within one hour_ I was on my couch burning up with a 103 fever_ worst headache of my life_ and my the time my boyfriend arrived to take me to the hospital_ I was soaked with sweat and I was throwing up which was more than painful with the headache.  I don't believe I have ever had a fever before and I knew immediately that it must have been really high; I literally felt like I was on fire inside my body.  I didn't know what the hell was wrong and I have never gone to the hospital for anything but I actually thought I might,"The day after the episode_ while I was home from work_ I started looking up the side effects of Bactrim online and found out that what happened to me wasn't all that uncommon and that Bactrim can cause a ""drug fever.""  I called the ER doc and told her was I found out and she was surprised and said she would make a note of it.  I called my PCP and made sure that an allergy to Bactrim would be in all my medical records.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT NO ONE TAKE THIS DRUG FOR A UTI; THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE FOR THAT THAT WON'T HURT YOU.

It made me feel kind of spacey and disconnected from my body_ weird sensations in my head_ which gave me anxiety and i thought i was dying which kept me from sleeping even though i've been so tired. It did get rid of my UTI after a few days_ but I am on day 10 right now and I am not going to take my last pill. This morning I developed a strange itchy rash on my arms_ legs_ hands_ chest_ and back. So far benadryl has no effect on it. My face feels like it's sunburned_ my throat is sore and dry_ my eyes are itchy and red and dry. I'm going to the hospital tomorrow morning if this doesn't clear up soon.

The side effects are bad enough to discontinue my treatment a little early.,I've taken this drug maybe 5 or 6 times before for UTIs with no side effects at all_ so this was surprising. I am taking another drug at the same time_ so maybe it was just a little much for my liver to try to process them both. On the up side_ I started to notice improvement in my UTI symptoms within hours of the first dose-- and this was a bad UTI. However_ in the future I will ask for cipro or some other antibiotic for UTI treatment.,F,28,4  days,3/14/2008,Bactrim

Had taken Levaqin in the past for Sinus Infection and experienced horrible psychological effects. Bactrim is better but I still feel sad and it makes me feel like no one likes me and nothing is worth doing. I have to remind myself all the time that its just the antibiotics and I will feel better after the drugs get out of my system. But still I want to call my mom every night and ask her to tell me everything is going to be ok. Drug seems to have cleared my infection. Did not experience any allergic effects. Needed to drink a lot of water. I doubled up on all of my vitamins including Cod Liver Oil. Antibiotics are rough and very depleting. Taking extra vitamins really helped to deal with the negative effects. This can be a useful drug if you really need it and don't develop allergic effects but don't expect a walk in a rose garden.,,,14  days,3/4/2008,Bactrim
1222, 1, Mrsa,Steven-Johnson Syndrome. If anyone has ever had this it is GOD AWFUL. I appologize in advance for any graphic comments. It starts with vaginal itching then leads to the vaginal skin pealing away down to the most raw area leading it to bleed. Peeing is beyond painful like pouring lemon juice on a wound. Also_ the my lips swelled and the inside of my lips felt like they were SEVERLY burned and it makes eating and drinking anything impossible. I also had insane itching on my right hand ring finger which is now just red. I had to keep it in a glass of ice to keep it from itching constantly.,I am down and out in bed because walking is so painful due to a bleeding vaginal area. I would not recommend this medicine to anyone. I am the 3rd person in my immediate family to be allergic to this family of medicine. The benefits do not out weigh the horrible (and from what I've researched on the web on Steven Johnson Syndrom)_ fatal side effects.

I thought I had the flu....  Continued taking Bactrim the second day with same results but this time a severe headache and heightened anxiety.  Terrified!  I stopped taking this.  Would rather be sick than scared for my life.,Not sure why my doctor prescribed this.....I have had a virus_ not an infection.  Taking Bactrim has been useless.  Has caused more trouble and trauma than any patient should be subjected to.  Beware when taking this drug!!,F,35,2  days,2/21/2008,Bactrim
1232, 1, paronychia,Hives over my entire body. Severe pain in all my bones and muscles as if I had been beaten up. Severe pains in my stomach. My neck went totally stiff. One finger briefly locked up. My face became flushed and I had both hot and cold chills at the same time!!!! My skin felt as if it was being pricked by dozens of needles.. I was drowsy but could not sleep. Suffered for 24 hours like an animal. I expect a slow recovery..,Allergic reaction came 1 day after I finished my 10 day prescription!  Amazingly had no effect on my infection!,M,54,10  days,2/21/2008Email,Bactrim
1233, 3, UTI,No side effects until the 10th day when my daughter rather suddenly developed  hives from head to toe_ swollen glands_ sore throat_ hot/cold flashes_ fatigue_ loss of appetite,Bactrim did clear up my daughter's UTI.  Now we know she is allergic to sulpha drugs_ but I don't think they should be removed from the market any more than the penicillin class.  Bactrim is effective and affordable to many.  I took this drug (under the name Septra DS) many years ago when I had a UTI with kidney stones--I had no adverse reaction to the drug whatsoever.  Obviously_ we all need to read the literature provided with the meds BEFORE we start taking them.  I didn't this time because of my previous experience_ but we were lucky because as soon as she broke out in hives_ I put her on benadryl_ thinking that she was reacting to something else.  While round-the-clock benadryl for two days has not yet cleared up the hives_ the doctor has assured us that her hives would be much worse without it and that it will take some time for the Bactrim to fully leave her system. I'm so glad to have these internet resources to become better educated.,F,16,10  days,2/18/2008,Bactrim
1234, 2, Mild Cellulitis (Foot),T+6 hours into taking my first prescribed 1600/320 (2 tablets) dose of generic Bactrim_ I was suffering the following side effects: VERY dry mouth_ distorted taste_ constant eye watering_ random bouts of itchiness (no visible rashes)_ moderate to severe aching in most joints_ stiff and painful neck and stiff and painful back.,Prescribed to knock out an infection in my foot of unknown origin_ but so far all it's done has made me feel worse than the infection ever did. Know my mother is allergic to sulfa-based drugs_ I can't help but wonder if this allergy could be genetic. Plan on discontinuing and getting a different antibiotic ASAP.,M,31,1  days,2/16/2008,Bactrim

Finally went to an ENT specialist who prescribed Bactrim.  Ever since taking it_ I have felt AWFUL.  I constantly feel like I'm going to throw up_ nothing at all is appetizing to me_ I can barely pick my own head up.  My sinus infection does seem to be improving_ but these symptoms I'm experiencing are far worse than the initial congestion.  I'm on day 7 of 10 and I'm praying I just make it through and all this stops.  If anyone has any experience coming off the drug (did symptoms stop right away?) I'm all ears!,F,23,10  days,2/12/2008Email,Bactrim
1236, 1, bacterial flu,I am a 51 year old woman.  I am experiencing severe nausea since first taking Bactrim yesterday for the Flu (I think). I didn't associate the nausea w/the drug; I thought it was still my Flu symptoms. I now have severe bloated upper stomach.  I'm also experiencing some paranoia_ weird thought patterns. My eyeballs are dry and I had shortness of breath.  I haven't taken an Antibiotic in probably 35 years. I don't usually take drugs but this particular Flu was so bad_ I had to find a doctor quickly (I'm new in town).  Welcome to the world of Chop Shop Medicine in America.  The ENT I finally found is associated with a group that has a good reputation or so I thought.  The whole process of seeing a Doctor this way is foreign to me.  I might as well have been a number.The Doctor was in my room for maybe 5 minutes.  I had to quick_ ask alot of questions.

I was prescribed a 2 week course of Bactrim for a UTI.  I took the medicine for about 10 days before I realized I was feeling a bit off.  I just didn't feel right_ but could not pinpoint what I was feeling. I tried to describe what was happening to my roommates_ but I was actually feeling a bit confused and kind of crazy and ""weird""_ making it hard to actually explain the feelings I was having.  I started sleeping a lot_ my roommates were trying to figure out what was going on.  Finally_ I started showing physical signs that something was not right.  I got a rash/hives up and down my body.  I had a fever and general weakness and malaise.  I got dizzy.  (I think I also had something weird with my throat_ tongue...honestly I can't remember all the details).  Finally_ they decided I had to go to the emergency room to figure out what was going on (we still hadn't even connected this to the bactrim I was taking).

(on NO other medications at the time) 8 days into taking it I broke out with hives all over my body but face.  That night I had major indigestion which turned into a major anxiety attack.  Terrible experience.  Woke up on day 9 w/same hives_ had a huge cold sore.  I went back in that day and was taken off Bactrim /went on predinisone and an antihistimine for the hives.  Valtrex / Denavir for the cold sore.  Taken off all antibiotics but not sure if staph is gone.  HOWEVER_ I have now been off the Bactrim for 2 days and am feeling much better.,My doctor told me that I should never take any drugs w/sulpher in them - again.  Amen_ sister.

1240, 1, PCP Prevention,After Bactrim was perscribed to me_ I read about all the negative side effects. I have only had allergic reactions to one anasthetic_ and I really thought I would be fine with Bactrim. Three days after taking it I was still feeling fine and my doctor said that any adverse effect would have shown_ so I thought I was out of the woods for any side effects. After my 11th dose (I was taking one a day_ so 11 days)_ I broke out with a rash before I went to bed. I called the doctor the next day and her diagnosis was an allergic reaction to Bactrim. I have a rash all over my body_ my face_ torso_ back legs and arms. It itches like crazy. I also have nausea. The doctor said the medication will stay in my body for about 10 days_ but I really hope this rash goes away.,I would seriously talk to you doctor about any alternative medications to Bactrim. I am usually pretty good at taking medications with no side effects. I have read a lot of complaints from people who otherwise don't have reactions to medication and they do to Bactrim. This seems like a very toxic drug.,M,35,11  days,2/6/2008,Bactrim

However_ the only side effect I had was fatigue_ which could also have been due to my double infection.  Like others have said_ this is definitely one of those ""hit and miss"" drugs that either works for you or doesn't.  After a 24 hour period_ my infection symptoms began diminishing drastically.  I completed treatment with no other effects from Bactrim.  Wonderful antibiotic_ if you're not allergic to sulfa drugs!",F,24,10  days,2/2/2008,Bactrim

About 30-45 minutes later_ I had severe cramping in my left handwhen I got home with here meds plus some groceries. I could not stop the cramping_ which turned to pain. My wife had to shut and lock the door. I broke the pill in half the next day and took it for 7 days. The following Friday morning_ a week later_ I awoke with terrible pain in left hand middle finger joint. It would not go away_ so; I got up and covered my self in the recliner and slept. I slept well over 17 hours straight_ which is not me. In fact_ I never suspected that bactrim was the cause of this cramping then very severe pain_ as I had taken another brand of the double stength about 6 years ago.,I will not take this again_ and; I as I look back over this last week_ I slept more then I ever have in my life. I also had stomach pain with it_ but; I needed to kill the infection. I had already had a problem with the first antibiotic prescribed. This is no antibiotic to fool with if you have any side effect.

Days 1-3 were unremarkable_ with only some mild side effects (dizziness_ nausea) but I did notice that there was no real relief from my UTI symptoms.  By the 4th night (last night)_ I was developing very slight skin discoloration and over the course of the evening my UTI symptoms started to worsen.  I couldn't sleep_ and was shaking with chills and was in the worst bladder/abdominal pain and vaginal pain I think I have ever experienced.  I slept three hours only due to a very strong painkiller that I would normally never take_ but I honestly didn't think I could last through the night.  I was in complete agony.

About an hour after taking the one pill I started to feel pain in my joints.  I just laid down and my right arm really started to hurt along with my right knee.  A few minutes after that the fever and chills set in.  I laid there almost the whole night just shivering.  All of my muscles and joints continued to hurt.  I couldn't sleep at all_ I could just lay there.  When I woke up this morning I still had the fever_ chills and pain.  A few new effects had come along too_ which includes_ three fingers on my left hand were numb_ a pounding headache but only when I would cough and bleeding from my nose and gums.

This will ruin your stomach as far as having a normal appetite. I have lost over 5 pounds. Nausea is pretty common_ but easier to handle if you take the meds with food. I am not sure if this causes insomnia/anxiety as I already take Klonopin along with this drug to deal with those pre-existing issues.

After taking my last dose (10 days)I developed the red rash over my entire body with the exception of my face.  I knew it was a reaction to the Bactrim.  After reading the ratings on this site_ I now know that there were other things that I did not associate with this drug.  I had felt jittery_ swimmy-headed_ somewhat irritable at times_ achey in my neck and shoulders.  I had sore spots on the back of my head just above the neck which I assumed were sore lymph nodes.

He would wake crying or screaming every night after 2 hours of sleep.  I was told I spoil him_ he is breastfeeding_ he's just being needy_ let him cry it out for hours.

1274, 5, Chronic recurring prostate / UI,Absolutely none.,Having tried short courses of antibiotics over 10 years_ including Bactrim_ only to have the problem return_ I went to a university medical library_ and found the recommendation for my chronic problem to be 50 (FIFTY)days.  I took this medication for the full course_ and it completely ended the problem.  That was in 1980. I was probably able to get this prescription because we had not entered the current anti-antibiotic hysteria.  By all means_ stop taking an antibiotic IMMEDIATELY_ as soon as you get side effects. Once I was prescribed Cipro for sinusitus.  It has the possible side effect ripping apart  the Achilles tendon_ so that the tendon breaks.  The first night_ I woke up with a tightening of the A. tendon_ so I stopped taking it immediately.

Several days into the treatment I began feeling achy and tired_ like I was coming down with the flu.  After 8 days I woke up in the middle of the night with shaking chills_ unable to get warm.  The next morning I took my dose of Bactrim and then broke out in a rash all over my chest_ back_ feet_ arms and legs.  Chills returned with a fever of 101.  Left work and went to immediate care clinic.  Doctor took me off Bactrim_ recommended trying Benadryl for the rash first; fever mostly subsided after a day off the Bactrim but the rash didn't respond to Benadryl_ instead spreading and turning very splotchy and hellishly itchy_ so doc started me on Prednisone.  After a day on the Prednisone the rash appears to be starting to subside a little bit_ I'm still quite tired_ and I have to take extra precautions to keep the original infected area clean because Prednisone is an immune system suppressant.

I went to an urgent care clinic and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it as an allergic reaction to the Bactrim.  Was prescribed a stronger dose of prednisone and a strong antihistimine_ which began alleviating the rash and itchiness within a few hours.

Then my fever got worse (101.5 degrees) and I noticed redness in my face and chest area. Looked and felt like I was sunburned. Rash then spread to my upper body and arms as well. Face_ chest_ arms_ and ears felt hot to the touch. My neck felt stiff like I slept bad and I also had to lumps in the back of my neck. The right side of my meck was swollen as well. My eyes also felt a little weird when I looked up.,,F,26,12  days,6/4/2007,Bactrim
1370, 2, UTI,This will definiltey knock out your bladder infection_ but you're pretty much guaranteed a yeast infection. Everytime I take Bactrim_ I immediately have to start on the Monistat. I guess a yeast infection beats a bladder infection. I'm immune to Macrobid & Macrodantin_ so Bactrim has pretty much been all I can take.,I take Bactrim as preventative UTI when needed. I am only supposed to take 1 800-160MG_ but I cut it into 1/4. It's strong enough to do that.,F,30,1  days,6/1/2007,Bactrim
1371, 1, Staph Infection,Chills_ upset stomach_ cramps_ constipation_ 102 fever_ bright red rash from knees to ankles_ and also from mid chest level to top of my head.  I had major chest congestion and was on breathing treatments every four hours.  In addition_ I was told that I was a red as a tomato.  Dehydration_ uncontrollable shakes_ insomnia_ every joint in my body hurt and it felt as if I was hit by a truck.,Not very interested in taking this medicine anytime soon.  Within 15 minutes of taking the pill_ I knew it wasn't going to be a good night.  I immediately felt like it was going to come back up the same route it went down.  After getting the upset stomach_ I immediately came down with a fever and uncontrollable shaking.  A co-worker had come down with the flu about a week earlier and had similar symptoms_ so I thought I had the flu also.  I only took 4 pills over a two day period_ but with each pill_ I was definitely getting worse.  I had no appetite_ was constipated_ and began breaking out in a rash within one day of taking the first pill_ which happened to be last Tuesday night.  Wednesday was pretty much a blur and Thursday_was probably one of the worst days of my life.  I went in to work and I thought was on my way home by 11:00 a.m.  My wife had read up on this drug_ contacted my doctor and she wanted to see me immediately.  I don't even remember the trip to the doctors office.  N,M,42,3  days,5/30/2007,Bactrim

TOTALLY FEELING OUT OF SORTS.,I THINK I HAVE TAKEN BACTRIM BEFORE.  BUT I WILL NEVER TAKE AGAIN.   I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH AN INFECTED FINGER AND WAS GIVEN BACTRIM.  I TOOK MY FIRST PILL AROUND 6 PM.  I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING WITH A MASSIVE HEADACHE AND FELT SLIGHTLY NAUCEOUS.  I TOOK THE SECOND PILL AROUND NOON NOT RELIZING IT WAS THE PILL AND THE HEADACHE AND NAUCEA(SP ?) GOT WORSE.  I DID NOT TAKE ANOTHER ONE AND WENT TO MY DOCTOR THE NEXT DAY FOR A DIFFERENT ANTIBIOTIC.  SHE DIDN'T MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT MY REACTION TO THE MEDICINE.  I AM SO GLAD TO COME ACROSS THIS WEBSITE BECAUSE I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE WAS WRONG WITH ME.

After that thankfully passed_ I developed exteme sensitivity in my left upper and lower teeth.  Saw the doctor on 7th day who told me it was a virus and to continue the Bactrim for the sinus infection. I did against my better judgment. On 8th day woke up with a rash over entire body. Called the doctor & was told to immediately stop the Bactrim.  Was put on prednisone for the rash & the sinus infection.,I knew something was wrong.  Antibiotics always make me feel tired and wiped out but I NEVER get sicker when I am on any antibiotic and I have had several different ones since I am allergic to pencillin.  This was my first and last time for Bactrim.  The sinus infection seems to be gone but now I feel even worse than before. It's right there in the pharmacy brochure that joint pain and fever are two of the many symptoms that can be allergic reactions and to CALL YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.  But not until I had the rash all over did the doctor even consider that I might be having an allergic reaction.  Now I have a red_ bumpy face_ red bumps all over my body and am constantly worried about how much more severe this reaction may get (i.e. Stevens-Johnson syndrome)plus I can't even get my doctor to return my calls.  I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.,F,55,8  days,5/23/2007,Bactrim

Had to switch drugs to take norflaxacin instead; still waiting for that to work.,I took this once before and didn't get the side effects_ but it didn't work against my infection then either.

I was horrified to read that Bactrim is considered extremely hazardous in the UK_ and it's a combination of 2 drugs_ the most dangerous of which isn't even necessary to treat a UTI_ but doctors just prescribe the combo pill out of habit. I just took a Benadryl to halt the itching. I hope it works. This is a little scary.

1420, 4, Staph,severe stomach upset_ muscle aches in thighs and lower back_ severe sunburn-like rash on head,This drug successfully treated the staph infection_ however the side effects were horrifying. There definitely needs to be more education to patients from both pharmacists and doctors.(1) The drug labeling gave no indication that taking it with food would help to minimize stomach upset. I had to learn this on my own after extreme stomach upset_ pain_ and diahrrea. Sometimes even with food_ these symptoms occurred_ but not as dramatic.(2) I didn't realize until I had been off the drug for a few days that it must have also caused bad aches in the muscles of my thighs and lower back. One day it would be my left leg_ then the next day it would be my right leg. I didn't connect it to the drug at the time.(3) By far the worst side effect was the rash_ though it also took me a while to connect it to the drug because it didn't start until the last (20th) day of taking the drug. It started with small bumpy skin on the side of my forehead_ which continued to get red and worse for five days,M,49,20  days,2/16/2007,Bactrim
1421, 1, masititis,After taking the generic brand of bactrim (SMZ/TMP DS) for 8 days. I developed lumps in the back of my neck and stiffness. Nausea and diarrhea. The sight of food made me sick. Shortness of breath I mean I would be out of breathe half way through cleaning out the dish drainer. I felt weak and tired_ but couldnÂ’t sleep. I couldn't get enough to drink. Frequent urination. To top it all off I was on my menstrual cycle_ and I was bleeding more than usual.,I would not recommend this medicine for any one. I think the side effects are worse than the diagnosis itself. I stop taking the med with one day left; I just couldn't handle the pain or not sleeping.,F,27,8  days,2/13/2007Email,Bactrim

By day 6 I realized my sleepless nights and constant body jerking when I tried to be still and rest were from the medication.  I too thought I was just getting the flu with fever and chills.  The next day I woke up with red blotches all over my skin.  I thought it was from taking Tylenol PM with it the night before.  The pharmasict said NO...that's not the cause.  He didn't know what it was.  I continued taking it and got worse the next day...Oh MY GOD...I thought I was gonna die.  I went to the dermatologist...YEP YOU'RE ALLERGIC to BACTRIM.  He put me on prednisone and tested my platelets (low count) and by day 7 of prednisone...I woke up dizzy and fell over for 8 days straight.  The dizziness and now vomitting has continued and it's now been 3 months...I have seen a neurologist_ ENT_ cardiologist...the ENT suspects OTOTOXICITY...poison damage from the bactrim.,I would never ever take this drug again!!!!,F,40,7  days,1/21/2007Email,Bactrim

The first two days were not bad as far as side effects_ but the last few have been TERRIBLE.  At first I thought I was getting the flu_ but it never progressed_ and never went away.  Now I know it's the meds. I constantly feel sick to my stomach_ like you feel right before you vomit.  Terrible.  I'm not sure if the sleeplessness is caused by the medication or by the fact that I feel like I'm going to vomit at any given moment.

1436, 1, Sinus Infection,"Within two hours of taking the second pill_ I began to vomit and develop a fever of 103. I took the next day's dosage b/c I thought it was the flu. I was wrong. The fever continued in addition to the vomiting and I broke out in hives all over my body and my face swelled up. This occured despite my only having digested 3 of the Bactrim pills. I had to go to the Emergency room because the doctor I saw at Urgent Care over the weekend_ laughed in my face and didn't take my request for another antibiotic seriously. He told me to go the ER because he thought more serious problems were going on. Guess what. There were serious problems. BACTRIM!! It almost killed me. And it took the ER dr. 6 hours to figure this one out_ b/c he too ignored my repeated efforts to tell him that I was having an allergic reaction to Bactrim. He made me drink contract to see if my appendix had ruptured first_ then he took CT scans of my abdomen and my sinus cavity. Low and behold_ my ""gut"" area is clear b",Do not allow any doctor to laugh off your concerns about Bactrim. Not ALL anti-biotics cause a fever_ nausea and vomiting the way Bactrim does to those people who are allergic to it. You will also develop anaphalaxis (hives) after the fever_ vomiting and nausea start. So be very careful. Avoid Bactrim at all costs. It's a dangerous sulfate.,F,36,2  days,1/3/2007,Bactrim

1443, 1, Adult onset acne,Strange headache that felt like three things at once...first_ a tight band around the back of my neck/head.  Second_ a constant shrill noise in my left ear that increased in intensity over the months_ and a roaring sound in the other ear. This part would never respond to any kind of medicine.  Plus the throbbing part of a headache that would respond to medicine.  Also had occasional flu like symptoms_ extreme fatigue_ sudden urgent diarrhea_ vertigo_ dizziness_ joint and muscle pain from the waist down_ nervousness_ and depression.  Gained about 20 lbs. from lack of activity while this ill.,I had been taking 1/2 of a tablet of bactrim for about three years with no problem what so ever for the acne.  Some of the symptoms were present for years and were basically written off by my doctors.  Then last March 9th_ I woke up one morning with a headache and it would never go away.  I described those same symptoms to countless doctors this year..primary care doc_ ENT_ Sinus Specialist_ neurologist_ dentist (for tmj)_ dermatologist who prescribed the bactrim to begin with_ chiropractor_ eye doctor_ otoneurolgist_ and a pain specialist.  Most pushed me out the door to the next doctor or just stared at me like a doe in the headlights when I told them what was going on.  I lived with this from March 9th to mid December of 2006.  Not one doctor mentioned the problem was more tinnitus than headache.  I finally figured it out on my own.

Right near the end of the second round_ I started to feel sick. I was only just back to work and thought it was the flu.  I let it go a couple of days_ feeling sicker and weaker and finally my husband took me to emergency.  I had drug induced hepatitis_ elevated biliruben_ acute liver inflamation_ anorexia_ dehydration_ lower back pain_ aching joints_ general weakness and very low blood pressure.

I take no drugs at all_ even over the counter medications...I feel your body generally heals itself. I have only the very occasional drink of wine and never eat any kind of junk or fast food. I cook totally fresh and from scratch...no processed foods. I had no choice in the matter with the spider bite. They said I had to take the drug and I did. I kept asking everyone if the drug could have caused all my symptoms_ but it was not until my hepatitis panel came back completely negative did they listen and start to really look into the side effects of this drug.

Someone at work told me.  This is after 2 doses. I was very tired this morning but don't know if I should attribute that to Bactrim or just my night-person.,Pharmacist says it's an allergic reaction. Call the doctor. Doctor says unlikely it's an allergic reaction.  Take only 1 a day instead of 2 and take an antihistamine and see how it is on Monday.

I reached in my mouth to find the problem and pulled out_ rather painfully_ a few strips of skin from the roof of my mouth and my lower lip.  I called up my local pharmacist and he asked a few questions about my past and my family.  My half-sister is allergic to sulfur based drugs and the connection was finally made by the PHARMACIST_ not the doctor_ that I had developed a severe allergy to sulfonomides.  The pharmacist said that if I had continued taking the drug as any ""good patient"" would have I could have wound up in the ER or worse.

Sure I read the package and saw the side effects_ but I never let that deter me. I took it right on time every day just like the instructions said_ and I was completely cleared up within 2 days! Not to give the wrong impression_ but if this is what peeing is supposed to feel like_ count me in! Jeez! I haven't felt that good passing urine in YEARS! Maybe it's because I'm younger than some on here_ but I think Bactrim is the best thing since sliced bread and it saddens me to see so many people having problems with it.

1475, 1, prostate infection,After only two doses_ I developed a circular rash on my upper thigh. I experienced severe anxiety_ fatigue_ dizziness_ muscle pain_ confusion_ and general lethargy. My doctor had taken me off Cirpo after six days because it had caused similar side effects_ and changed me to Bactrim.

I've had these before but the Bactrim seemed to make them worse. Also_ on the 8th day I developed an allergic reaction.,I was prescribed this drug because I'm allergic to amoxicillin/penicillin and the doctor wanted to make sure it wasn't MRSA in the abscess_ but I had to quit with 4 pills left when I developed a severe rash/hives all over my face_ stomach_ arms_ and upper legs. I was diagnosed with a severe sulfonamide allergy and given antihistamines to clear up the rash_ which finally faded on the 5th day after it began_ but the itching on my legs persisted for some time. I didn't realize how many side effects the drug was having until I wasn't taking it any more and suddenly felt a lot better. The abscess drained the night it was prescribed_ too_ so I don't even know if I needed to go through all that.,F,18,8  days,8/10/2006,Bactrim
1478, 5, urinary tract infection,broke out in a rash,This medicine worked wonders... after one dose.  The only thing about it was when I was almost at the end of my bottle_ I broke out in a rash that spread over my whole body and itched like crazy.  I stopped taking it_ obviously and the infection was already cured so I didn't have to take anything else except steroids to get rid of the rash. But_ no regrets because the UTI was way worse than the rash.,F,21,9  days,8/5/2006,Bactrim

UTI did go away within the first 2 days and didnt think the rash was associated with the meds as i have had a stubborn isolated skin rash for a few months that the DR said was due to dry skin because of winter. When the skin itchiness spread quickly and went nuts_ i decided to do some research and after reading these comments here_ i realised it must be the meds_ and with back-up comments here on this site which describe my symptoms exactly_ i am discontinuing my medication from this moment.

After 4 days_ went to a different ER due to searing pain down right leg and continued symptoms.  I was admitted to hospital and taken off Bactrim. The blood tests showed very high liver enzymes and due to symptoms the doctors thought I passed a gall stone damaging my liver.  However_ all tests showed no gall bladder problems and I improved greatly in the hospital.  My liver enzymes came down.

The fever_ misery_ etc._ recurred for several days--I became overheated easily and I passed out once.  The sixth day my ears and the palms of my hands became hot and itchy.  The seventh day my whole body itched and burned_ my face swelled up_ and I had red areas on my body like I had been slapped_ and red bumps all over my legs.  For about a month after stopping Bactrim I couldn't walk up a flight of stairs without gasping for air; I had been bicycling several miles a day before starting Bactrim.,A nurse and a doctor told me it couldn't be the Bactrim making me sick so I kept taking it.  Even when I got the rash_ another doctor said it was probably strep_ but to quit the Bactrim just in case.  I took a lot of prednisone and antihistimines to get the swelling and redness down.  This happened four months ago and my skin is still a little bit pink and my face gets a red flush every evening.  I had what I would describe as an emotional breakdown on the seventh day of taking this drug and I still don't feel quite back to normal.  I believe this drug is useful for some people but of the several doctors and nurses I talked to_ none of them knew much about the potential harm Bactrim can cause.  I was lucky--this drug can kill and seriously harm people and many medical professionals don't seem to know this.

It started on my upper torso - I went inside - and in a few hours the scalded appearance was worsening and had spread all over my body.  I ended up in the ER with cortisone IV_ some other IVs_ and 10 days of prednisone.  I was told the medication could stay in your system for 10 days.  No one believed I'd not been in the sun - but the HEAT actually set the reaction off - not the sun.  My windpipe was closing.  It is dangerous medicine.  I would not recommed anyone take it!

1530, 5, Adult Acne,Diarrhea_ joint pain,Awesome treatment for acne. I have taken bactrim DS for two years (with regular monitoring of blood cell counts) and it worked wonderfully. My acne scars even faded away naturally. I recently switched to a new dermatologist because I have relocated. He refused to prescribe bactrim to me and asked me to take adoxa (doxycline) and all of the acne problems came back. Then he recommended Accutane_ which I have refused. I guess it's time to find a new MD.,F,31,2  years,8/28/2005,Bactrim
1531, 5, prevention of uti,Mild sensitivity to sun,I have taken bactrim ds on and off for about 2yrs.  Prior to this I would have uti's more often than normal (sometimes up to 6 per year).  My doctor prescribed bactrim as for as a preventative_ suggesting I take one every time I have sex (and take the twice a day dose for a week if an infection did develop).  This has worked very well_ and I only developed one UTI since (after going OFF of my doctor's suggestions for two months).  Additionally_ I have found that my acne clears up when I take bactrim.,F,26,2  years,8/21/2005,Bactrim

1533, 4, Urinary tract infection,Queasiness_ diarrhea_ rash on chest_ torso & arms.,I was prescribed a 10-day cycle of Bactrim for a UTI_ after a 7-day cycle of Levanquin failed to resolve the problem.  The Bactrim upset my stomach and gave me diarrhea.  One night I had a very bad sore throat_ which developed into a cold_ but I don't know if this was related.  The day after I finished the cycle_ I woke up with a spotty red rash all over my chest and torso.  This may have been triggered by a half-hour of sun exposure at the pool.  I found Bactrim unpleasant and hard on my system_ but it did work.  Afterwards I read on WebMD that often 3 days is enough for a UTI_ and I wonder if I should have been prescribed a shorter cycle.,M,36,10  days,7/29/2005,Bactrim

One doctor said it was serum sickness from bactrim. I was on prednisone for two months. I ended up with sores with scabs the size of half dollars on my lower legs. I had to have tons of blood tests - my ANA was sky high. I was so sick for about four months_ after about the sixth month I feel my old self_ except I have horrible scars on my legs.

Fatigued...tried to go back to the gym to excercise but was way to fatigued_ probably due to the lack of sleep this drug has caused me. My sleep pattern has become so bad on Bactrim.

1556, 4, Acne,Mild nausea_ especially in the AM; reduced appetite; gradual weight loss (a good thing -- I've been wanting to drop 10 pounds_ and I'm almost there now :)).,Bactrim has been working very well for my stubborn adult acne.  During the first few weeks_ I had increased breakouts_ but now my skin is clear for the first time in a long while. I will be having blood work done this month to make sure the medicine isn't affecting my white blood cell count.  For long-term use of Bactrim_ getting a regular CBC (complete blood count) test is recommended. My dermatologist seems to want to keep me on this medicine for at least a few months_ and perhaps indefinitely. Other strategies to control my acne (hormonal contraception_ Retin-A_ topical antibiotic gel) haven't worked_ so this is a stepped-up approach. It seems a little extreme to me_ but it's working_ and it's not as scary as going to Accutane.,F,36,2  months,11/30/2004,Bactrim
