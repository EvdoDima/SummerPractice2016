3, 1, UTI,I was 17 when I took Bactrim for a UTI_ I was a month away from turning 18 and was given this because another antibiotic would have more side effects I was told. I took it for 5 days and became horribly sick from a nasty cold and was told to stop Bactrim and to take Z Pac instead for 5 days. As soon as I stopped taking the Bactrim the next morning I broke out in hives. I thought it was a heat rash but it was all over my body and a cold bath did not get rid of it. Called my doctor and said it's likely a sulfa allergy. Couldn't take Benadryl to get rid of it because I had a fever and didn't want to become dehydrated. Had to stay home from work and school for an entire week until the rash went away. Absolutely horrible experience. Thankfully my UTI was gone by the time I stopped taking it.,Common allergy,F,19,5  days,8/2/2016Email,Bactrim

Lethargic_ messed up heart rhythm _ feel like I'm dying_ swollen_ increased appetite _ headache_ nervousness . I wished I had read side effects of taking SMZ generic for Bactrim .

This is deadly medicine,I read where this medicine can cause death and where 49 yr old man took aspirin and had kidney failure & had to have blood transfusion. Also this medicine can cause Steven Johnson syndrome (sjs) which causes your skin to peel off your body exposing flesh which causes other infections.

18, 1, Bacterial infection from cyst.,I didn't have any side effects from the drug until I stopped taking it. First day after last dose I had small rash on my back where my bra lays... Didn't think anything about it. That night I had red pinpoints on my whole body. Slowly grew into a large rash. Felt like I had a 3rd degree sunburn. Took benadryl for two to three days till I felt like it was cleared up. Now a week after the last dose I am covered in hives_ I itch like crazy_ my knee joints and ankles are swollen. The rash slowly moved up my scalp_ and neck and onto my face. I could have dealt with the rash and uncomfortable itchiness but I began to have problems breathing. I went to the er last night and am now on two antihistamines_ a steroid_ and an inhaler. Along with giving me an epinephrine shot_ my resting heart rate was at 130 (that's what I am at when I am jogging) I made sure to put sulfer antibiotics onto my allergy list.

20, 1, UTI,If I could give this drug a minus I would!  it started off just giving me stomach pain_ but apparently I became lethargic_ dehydrated and incoherent_ and if it weren't for someone finding me_ probably wouldn't be here.  They took me to the ER where I'm told I had tons of tests despite them being told I was on a new antibiotic_ which they were told was irrelevant.  My liver enzymes were elevated_ but all the testing returned nothing else and I was sent back home with the advice to contact my doctor!  Wow_ thanks.  My friends had the good sense to stop the medication_ and in a few days I started to come around_ but that was so scary!  I thought I was an exception_ but seems from what I'm reading here it's not at all.,With all the issues surrounding this drug_ I can't understand why it is still so freely prescribed!,F,62,4  days 1X D,6/8/2016,Bactrim

After being on Bactrim for 8 days noticed several small hives on my upper thighs. Per doctor instructions_ I stopped taking the antibiotic and began taking Benadryl. By the next day they have spread down my leg and up my chest.  It's been two days since I first noticed and I'm covered all over my body_ hands_ feet and face.

25, 2, Skin infection,Widespread rash_ black patches of skin_ severe fever_ headaches_ fatigue_ chills_ hot skin_ dehydration,After about ten days_ I developed a widespread rash all over my body but particularly on my arms and legs. It was flat_ red_ and hot to the touch. There were patches along the inside of my limbs that were nearly black. I developed a 103F fever that kept me perpetually tired and bedbound. It was painful to do simple tasks like walk to the bathroom_ shower_ heat myself soup_ etc._ because I always felt a chill.Went to a clinic where the doctor informed me that I had Stevens-Johnson syndrome_ a rare_ skin-rotting allergic reaction to sulfa medications like Bactrim. He told me the mortality rate was 55%. Clinic called an ambulance to take me to the hospital_ and my mother had to tell them to refuse so she could take me herself. Didn't wait long to get into the ER because staff was afraid I'd go into shock. Had an IV put into both arms.Luckily_ my case was minor_ and I was allowed to go home. However_ I could have died if I put off seeking medical attention for longer. I don't blame the doctor for prescribing me Bactrim_ but I'd advise caution if you don't know what medicine allergies you have. If I had been given a sulfa drug during or after an emergency surgery_ I very well could have died.,F,22,10  daysBactrim DS 2X D,5/13/2016Email,Bactrim

A lot of information says you have a rash with drug reactions. I did NOT. My skin infection did clear up. It wasn't that bad to start with. I asked him for something topical. Was not my regular Doc who prescribed it. My Doc said it was overkill. Just because the guy's a doctor doesn't  mean he is a good doctor! Be your own advocate. Another round of this crap--who knows!

In the morning_ I continued my bactrim regiment and by mid-day couldn't wear a shoe on my right foot because it would send radiating pain up into my calf area. I continued taking the pill. On the third day_ I woke up_ got out of bed_ and immediately fell to the floor in excruciating pain. So much as running my fingernail along my foot sent unbearable pain shooting up into my leg. Touching other areas sent an odd itching sensation throughout my limb. I'm experiencing tingling_ a pin-prick pain randomly throughout my body_ and random pains and itches without any stimulation.

I called the pharmacist who suggested that I up my water intake. For my next dose_ I drank half a bottle of water before taking the pill followed by another full bottle of water after swallowing the pill. I also had a small snack each time I took a dose_ right after the water consumption. And then I kept water close by all day.

41, 4, MRSA pressure ulcer / osteomyelytis,stomach pain_ bloating_ insomnia_ exhaustion_ nausea_ and possibly constipation.,This is an incomplete review as I have not followed up with my doctor yet (appointment this week). However_ I have had a pressure ulcer (open wound) for almost 1 year. They found I had a bone infection and had to do 6 weeks of IV meds. The IV meds killed off all the infections EXCEPT MRSA. Rather than going back to IV meds_ the doctor prescribed a high dose of Bactrim. I am almost 3 weeks into the treatment and the wound seems to have actually closed - this is of course pending results from various tests that will be done in the following weeks. However_ this is one of the most hopeful signs I have had in almost a year. The side effects can be bad and I sometimes dread having to take the medicine_ but if the end result is that it allowed my open wound to finally close_ it will be worth the side effects. I will post a follow up review after seeing my doctors_ but just wanted to post this for any of those in a similar situation to try to stick with it as long as the side effects are not extremely horrible (based on your physician's advice).,M,31,18  days1600 2X D,3/28/2016Email,Bactrim

The pain in my neck_ head_ and every joint in my body was unbearable. If you already experience any of these problems I highly do not recommend taking Bactrim; or if you're sensitive to medicine.

43, 3, Staph/abscess,Sweating_ feeling extremely hot_ headache_ upset stomach towards the end of taking medication. Loss of appetite. Heartburn/acid reflux.,I generally feel ill when taking antibiotics and Bactrim was no different. It was not as bad as other people have experienced though. I didn't have nausea or vomiting because with most antibiotics you have to eat first and drink plenty of water. I'd eat and then 10-15 minutes after I would take my pill. I did however always feel like I was constantly burning up from the inside out. No matter what temp my environment was I was always hot. And I did get headaches that medicine didn't really help with. I only have 2 more days of the medication and I've started to have diarrhea/more frequent bowel movements. I've tried to take a probiotic every day with the meds to hopefully prevent this. And it wasn't extremely noticeable to me until today but I have had loss of appetite. I did not eat dinner at all last night and when I tried to eat today I did feel a little queasy. Also for the past few days I've had really bad acid reflux while laying down. These symptoms are basically all mild and not unbearable.

It also took the Bactrim 3 days to start working. I had UTI's before and cannot remember it taking this long for any medication to work that they had given me in the past. It is now Monday_ of all days_ and I have to go back to work today after being off all week long last week. I think that Bactrim would be okay for a short term illness_ but should not be taken for 14 days. It is a pretty strong drug. I also still have symptoms of this UTI. It should be completely gone after taking this medication for two weeks as well. I feel much better other than the side effects but still feel a little bit of pain in my pelvic area. From the comments that I had read above_ it sounds like a lot of those people are allergic to this drug. I would had called my doctor immediately and had him take me off of it. I do not want to take this stuff again either. There has to be something better out there that works a lot faster too. I think some doctors just believe in some medications more than others. They need to listen to the patients more often. Give them what they say works best for them. There is no reason why he could not have put me on something that worked faster than 3 days.

Decided to stop after one and a half days. That was yesterday and I am beginning to feel a little less of the side effects.
