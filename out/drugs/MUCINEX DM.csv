0, 1, Chest & sinus congestion,none,"Taking the ""Maxium Strength"" Mucinex DM and didn't feel much relief at all_ felt congested and had runny nose all the time and didn't cough up much phlegm.   Not sure what works better but felt I wasted $25 for buying both the day & night maximum strength versions.",M,55,2  days 2X D,7/9/2015Email,Mucinex dm
1, 1, Cough associated with cold,Holy moly. Four hours after taking it I broke out in a profuse seat my heart was racing and I finally vomited & felt a bit better. 2 hours later same thing all over again not quite as bad. Several waves of nausea since then but I feel just semi OK 8 hours after the dose. Dehydrated and light headed but no longer nauseous. Still jittery and feel like my HR is elevated. Scary.,I cannot recommend this medicine. My reaction was so swift & severe I really considered calling 911. Seriously. And as others have commented elsewhere there is nothing about this on the box.,F,54,1  days 1X D,6/28/2015Email,Mucinex dm
