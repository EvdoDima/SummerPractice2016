0, 5, High Blood Pressure_ Palpatations,I don't remember having any side effects when I first started taking the medication_ but for the last year I've had quite a few bad feelings_ I honestly thought I had MS. I was born with spina bifida so some of the symptoms I've had I thought was just aging with spina bifida_ but now after talking to my doctor_ he feels most of my symptoms are coming from the tenormin. I'm having bad balance problems to the point I can't go up and down stairs or even up a little stoop in front of a store without feeling like I'm going to fall_ my eyes are blurry_ muscle aches_ extremely tired_ and just the feeling of having the flu but without the related fever or stomach issues_ tingling all over_ I feel like shoes are on my feet when there aren't any_ extremely cold hands_ feet_ swelling like I was stung by a bee in my hands and feet_ gained weight_ about 25 lbs in less then a year.

2, 4, Rapid heartbeat,None,I have a heart condition that causes me to have a faster-than-normal heartbeat (130 BPM resting). This brought my heart rate down to 70 BPM--well within healthy range. As a bonus_ it also lowered my blood pressure_ which wasn't high but borderline high. Now when I go to the doctor_ I have a perfect pulse and blood pressure of 108/67. Terrific! My ONLY gripe is that it seems to have lost effectiveness within the past 2 months (my heart rate has increased to 87 BPM on average). It still works_ but I may need to up the dose or switch to something else if my pulse keeps climbing.,M,29,1  years50MG 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Tenormin

8, 2, High BP_ irregular heartbeat_,Dizzy_ scared_ feeling like I'm gonna faint_ disrupted sleep,I took this med for aprx one year and hated it. Lost weight so my BP was great and I got off of it. My hip returned so I was put back on it again. Now I'm feeling very dizzy at times_ and think I'm going to pass out. Feel weird_ off balance_ loss of interest_ and just as I'm going to fall asleep it feels as if I'm going to faint. This happens about 10 times during the night. Was hospitalized for 6 days because of it. The hosp made me stop it to do testing to see if I had kidney problems. I did not so my dr put me back on it. While in hosp they gave me trandate which made me feel fine_ no side effect_ except loss of interest for a few days.

9, 1, Heart rate,After a while taking this drug I started to have difficulty getting up the stairs. I found that I was pulling myself up whilst holding the stair rail. On really bad days I would crawl up on all fours to reach the top as my legs just wouldn't carry me. On reaching the top of the stairs I would have to lay down on a bed until my legs felt near to normal as possible. Also_ I found doing every day task an effort_ i.e. carrying a pile of ironing upstairs_ carrying wet washing in basket outside to hang up on washing line (by the time I reached the line my legs would feel as if they were going to give way). Basically I have got to the stage where I can't be bothered to do anything_ everything is a chore. I visited my doctor today and she has taken me off this drug not for the weakness in my legs but for the other symptom I have_ being_ numbness in tips of fingers. She hasn't linked this weakness to the drug. Why aren't these symptoms listed in the leaflet giving advise?,I'm hoping that these side effects don't take ages to dissapear as I want to get my life back.,F,63,3  months25mg 1X D,6/14/2012Email,Tenormin

24, 2, A-Fib,The only good thing I can honestly say about this drug is it did finally put me back in normal sinus rythem and keep me there once I figured out to take half of the dose in the morning and half at bedtime. But I started to get some of the not so pleasing side effects and I must admit_ I think I got all of them except the male ones. I had hives and itching all over my body_ I was so tired and no energy all I did was work and eat and go to sleep. I had such weakness I couldn't even carry my laudry basket that was half full and not to mention the muscle aches and joint pain. My back was so painful that by afternoon and night I couldn't stand and it hurt to move in any direction. The mood swings_ either I was crying or wanting to kill someone at almost anytime day or night. I gained 35 lbs over this period of time and no matter what I did to loose it I kept gaining. I could literly see my self get bigger and bigger. I had a very dry mouth_ dry eyes_ increase thirst and decreased urination,There has to be other alternatives with this medication that doesn't ruin your life.

Of course. this is through my cardiologist orders.It is important to get some exercise during the day. A good brisk 15 to 30 minute walk and a healthy diet are the keys to NO SIDE EFFECTS!

32, 1, hypertension,Loss of appetite immediately after taking pill; super hyperactivity; couldn't come calm down  yet felt like it took the edge off  my mood swings; confused_ spaced out_ dropped my blood sugar to dangerously low levels_ cold and terrible metallic taste in my mouth; felt like my tongue was swollen; kept trying to hydrate my lips and throat but didn't want to drink; insomnia,This was one of the most bizarre reactions to a drug I have had to date.  I know whether or not a drug will be good for me one hour after taking it.  I have a history of anaphylaxis to drugs so I'm very afraid of them. I took 12.5mg 2x/day - first day my appetite went away immediately. If you told me I could never eat again_ I would  have said fine by me.  The bloating in my stomach immediately went away and I lost 2 lbs the first day because I couldn't nor did i want to_ eat.  I felt like I had low blood sugar as I was spacy and confused.  Even when I would eventually put food in my mouth_ it didn't help. I drove to NYC with my daughter and her friend to a concert.  I was wide awake by the end of it_ and at midnight instead of heading home to CT_ I was in the lincoln tunnel heading for NJ and then was stuck on the bridge all the way back from traffic.  We got home 2am and I was still rearing to go and had so much energy it was frightening. My bp was elevated to 179/112 (usually in the 130's-150's/100's).  The next day it did drop to 120's-130's/80's which is good.  But I couldn't deal with energy. I was hoping it would make me sleepy as I never sleep with this hypertension.  I usually go to bed at 2-3am and am up at 5:30am. My dr had me stop it.,F,56,3  days,12/14/2009,Tenormin

It got cut off because it was too long.After my reaction to atenolol (comments in previous post below)_ my dr wants me to try corguard/nadolol but I'm afraid to because this drug specifically says ""if you have low blood sugar_ it could make it worse"" and ""if you stop it suddenly_ you can have a heart attack"" - atenolol didn't have that warning. This is now the 5th bp med I am trying_ as the calcium channel blockers (norvasc and plendil) had me curled up in a fetal position with a cluster headache like I have never had in this lifetime. I don't get headaches and this was so unbearable I thought I'd die.  They caused vomiting from the headache and elevated my bp to 250/135.  I also tried aldactone which also gave me a bad headache.  I don't know what I'll do if I keep on reacting to these meds.  I was supposed to add doxyzosin 1mg to the atenolol but didn't get that far. I don't like alpha blockers either.

(I must take the Merck brand-name Cozaar due to coughing caused by generics.)Few people who find negative side effects of this drug mention their weight...mine is normal for my 5'11"" height: 172 pounds.  That seems to really help the most.  Although my high BP is genetic_ and can't help that_ keeping weight low really helps...you must decide between feeling better or eating as much as you like.

I went from having created a business that provided a high six figure income to having very little because while taking it I made one bad decision after another.

58, 1, High Blood Pressure,Terrible constipation_ headaches_ wheezing & tightness in the chest and worst of all muscle weakness and fatigue.,"I had been regular as clockwork for years.  Switched from Benicar when I reached 65 and went on Medicare to avoid ""the gap"" by using inexpensive drugs.  After 5 days the constipation became so bad I ended up bleeding.  Started on Monday and by Friday when I went to cardio rehab I barely made it through the routine I had been doing without strain.  By Monday I could barely walk and had to cut much of my treadmill work.  In my opinion if I had continued on atenolol 25 it would have destroyed my life.  Fortunately a doctor agreed and I ended up back on Benicar.  She said some people tolerate the drug but she is seeing many with the problems I had.",M,65,7  days,12/8/2008,Tenormin
