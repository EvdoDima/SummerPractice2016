2, 1, Hypertension,Skipped heartbeats_inability to concentrate_muscle spasms,Was taking Diovan 160.Many side effects but Diovan controlled my blood pressure.Cardiologist switched me to Edarbi 40 saying it's a more powerful ARB drug.Tried it for a month.It didn't control my bp as well as Diovan.Edarbi produced annoying skipped heartbeats_made it difficult to sleep_burning skin sensation_inability to exercise_increased pulse_it also raised_not lowered_my bp_and finally_made it hard for me to think/concentrate which never happened on any other bp med.,M,67,1  months40 1X D,12/15/2012,Edarbi
