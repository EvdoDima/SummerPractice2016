0, 5, Enlarged Prostate,Decreased blood pressure caused dizziness when I stood up for about 6 weeks.   No longer a problem.,Symptoms of enlarged prostate were beginning to be severe before beginning this medication.  Symptoms remain greatly diminished so far.,M,76,8  years2 mg 1X D,5/3/2013,Doxazosin mesylate
1, 5, High Blood Pressure/Prostate,Small rash on wrist which went away after about 1 week.,Cardio recommended low dose (1/2 of a 2 mg.tablet./day) because I get rashes easily from Rx drugs. This stuff took 10-15 points off my top number BP. And it really helped my enlarged prostate....I'm peeing much better now. Been on it for 3 months... great stuff so far. Cheap too.,M,65,3  months1 mg 1X D,9/24/2012Email,Doxazosin mesylate
2, 5, enlarged prostate,,With an enlarged prostate the need to urinate often came suddenly and urgently_ and then it was difficult to 'hold' for very long. On the road or in public I would sometimes get desparate to find a bathroom_ quick. Very quick. Wetting my pants was not an option. This generic form of Cardura helps me with that. The signal 'you need to go' comes on a little slower_ and usually_ I can 'hold it' longer. Oftentimes the urgency fades again_ if I cann't get to the bathroom right away. Doxazosin doesn't make everything work the way it did before my enlarged prostate came along_ but it certainly helps. Enough to where I'm comfortable putting off some kind of expensive surgical procedure.  Indeed_ my symptoms haven't worsened in the last 3 & 1/2 years I've been taking it.,M,60,3  years4 MG 1X D,9/19/2010Email,Doxazosin mesylate
