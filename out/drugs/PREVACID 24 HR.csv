0, 1, Acid Reflux,After taking one pill I had indigestion_ fullness in my stomach_ decreased appetite_ food staying in my stomach longer than normal_ dry mouth_ drowsiness_ fatigue_ lethargy_ being unmotivated_ insomnia (initially)_ headache_ some depression_ weird (spacey) feeling.,These symptoms stopped after I stopped Prevacid.  I have found that both Zegerid and Aciphex work much better for me with little side effects.,M,51,1  days15 MG. 1X D,10/15/2013,Prevacid 24 hr
1, 1, HeartBurn,I took prevacid and my heart has been racing non stop. I wake up with my heart racing. I've been getting anxiety and panic attacks when I never had them before. My blood pressure went up to 180 at one time and I've been to the ER 3 times in the last year or less. I stopped taking the med and hopefully my heart stops racing. Lost mood and sex drive. Blurred vision and headsches as well. This is a horrible med. Never touching this again. Ill stick to eating yogurt for heart burn or natural route over this CRAP! BEWARE!!!!!! DANGEROUS!!!!,,M,34,6  months15mg,8/1/2013Email,Prevacid 24 hr

6, 5, GERD/ulcer,None,Prevacid worked very well on my GERD symptoms and helped heal a very painful_ severe non-H.pylori ulcer.  No side effects. Unless you are allergic_ I don't know how anyone can determine this drug doesn't work after only 2 doses. It clearly states that this drug may take 1 to 4 days to work for GERD and if you're using it for ulcer it can take weeks. As someone with severe anxiety disorder_ I understand the fear of taking a new drug but sometimes you have to give a drug a chance to work. I took Prilosec for several weeks - caused diarrhea. Prevacid is very gentle.,F,39,2  months15 mg 2X D,4/20/2011Email,Prevacid 24 hr
7, 1, ,SEVERE headache_vision changes_dizziness,"My son was having nausea/vomited once a week or every other week. His pediatrician put him on prevacid and now he is suffering from severe headache_ vision changes_ dizziness_ and cannot function. He hasn't been to school in a week. We've been back to the doctor twice and specifically asked if these could be side effects from the prevacid and she acted like I was a moron. ""No no we give prevacid all the time."" Took him to the eye doctor. Two days ago I called the doctor back and said you HAVE to give him something for this headache. They told me to take him to the ER which I did. After describing his symptoms they immediately did an MRI.  Negative (thankfully). I just found this web site and after reading through here and about the many many people who got severe headache from this drug I told him do not take your pill this morning. I now strongly believe that it is totally the prevacid that is causing these headaches an pray that he feels better very very soon (like today would be great.) I've been with the same pediatrician for 24 years but I will be changing doctors now. I would appreciate it if people would contact me and tell me how long after stopping the prevacid it was before their headaches went away.",M,13,20  days30mg 1X D,4/13/2011Email,Prevacid 24 hr

9, 1, gastritis and h pylori,abdominal cramps_ achy joints_ burping_ fullness_ headaches,I took 15 mg twice a day along with antibiotics for 10 days to treat h pylori infection.  Felt terrible the last few days of treatment likely due to the antibiotics; MD said to continue the Prevacid for 1 month.  Felt better for a few days after stopping antibiotics. Then began to feel really bad again.  I suspect the Prevacid and the very low acid in my stomach which perfectly matches my symptoms--fullness and burping after meals_ achy joints_ undigested food in stools_ difficulty digesting anything especially meat.  I plan to stop the Prevacid as of today!,F,69,30  days15 mg 2X D,11/17/2010,Prevacid 24 hr
10, 1, Esophagitis,Very dizzy_ faint feeling_ rumbling stomach_ blurred vision.,Took only two doses.  Second one evening before and woke up with a prickly_ itching sensation.  Returned to bed and when I went to get up I was extremely dizzy and almost fell twice.  Had to hold onto the bed and walls to get to the bathroom.  Felt very faint.  Diarrhea and gurgling stomach.  Now I don't know how long this will take to get out of my system.  Pharmacist says he doesn't think it would be from this medication.  Doctor said to switch to Pepcid.  I've tried Tagamet and got terrible headaches_ Omeprazole same.  Maybe try natural route.  These seem like dangerous drugs to me.  Very scary.,F,51,2  days15 MG 1X D,9/3/2010Email,Prevacid 24 hr
11, 1, Ulcer,I also had the same issue with prevacid and suffered numbness in my whole left side from the top of my head down to my feet. I also felt numb under my chin and in my throat and it felt like something was stuck in it. I got several ear infections called otitis media which is a inner ear infection along with sore throat that I never get. I had severe dizziness and headaches and almost past out one night when I got up to go to the bathroom after taking it. I latterly fell into my closet wall on my way in to the bathroom.My head also feels heavy and hurts slightly on one side of my brain. I hope this help's u...,I will not take this drug again as the side effects get worse the more u take it. It also causes mood swings maybe because u feel like crap almost like u have the flu. It does take several days for this to leave your system and am not sure what the half life of this drug is so I would give it at least 3 days for the symptoms to subside.,F,48,2  months15 mg. 1X D,5/29/2010Email,Prevacid 24 hr
