2, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,None,Rowasa helped pulled me out of several flares. I use it nightly for flares and taper down to once a week for maintenance to help prevent flare-ups. As long as I start back nightly on the Rowasa at the first sign of flare-up symptoms_ I have not had a bad flare since diagnosis in 2007.,F,27,4  years 1X D,10/3/2011,Rowasa
3, 5, Sigmoiditis,None,I was taking Rowasa (suppositories) for about 10 years.  Now I take Canasa_ which I believe took the place of Rowasa.  It works great for me!,F,53,15  years,1/31/2009,Rowasa
4, 3, Ulcerative colitis (4 years),Not really any side effects.  Cramping and urgency to go when first put in.  Gas and diarrhea the next morning.  My new doctor also said that you become somewhat dependent on it_ so he doesn't like it.  Plus_ it's embarrassing.,It worked well at first_ but lost its effectiveness.  But once I was on it_ I couldn't get off of it without the colitis flaring up again.  I'm currently at the very end of a gradual taper.,F,23,1  years,3/21/2008,Rowasa

6, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,Romance killer,Intermittent Use -- Worked fine at initial diagnosis and have tapered off on its usuage with remission.  If necessary_ I will use it for a 1x-daily for three to seven days at a time if discomfort levels suggest a flare up could be coming on_ and so far no significant relapses.(In a related matter_ since it has gone generic_ the delivery mechanism has suffered however.),M,42,27  months,11/28/2005,Rowasa
