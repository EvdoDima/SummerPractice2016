0, 5, Migraine,Mild constipation at first_ light headed first two days. Both gone by third day.,Literally cured me of my chronic migraines I have suffered from for 6 years. I have been on EVERY possible drug and tried every homeopathic remedy. Still going to continue with Botox treatments every 12 weeks plus topamax for now but hoping to wean off of topamax in future. Anyone with chronic migraines try this!,F,32,7  days5 mg,6/2/2016Email,Namenda
1, 5, Alzheimers,During the  titration  period we noticed sligh constipation.,My father has been on this medication for almost 4 yrs.  The medication has been very well tolerared. Although a major improvement is not seen the dimentia seems to remain at a steady manageable pace.  We have thought about starting combination strategy with Aricept to further slow the decline but we have been very skeptical from all of the negative side effect associated with the med (which were identical to the ones Dad had with initial attempt 4 yrs back).  Overall I highly recommend Namends. It will not create an improvement but it will slow down the deterioratio of your loved one.  ,M,88,3  years20mg,3/18/2016,Namenda
2, 2, Memory Loss and confusion,My husband has become increasingly paranoid and depressed and has begun to isolate himself.  His memory has improved_ but his former memory is confusing to him because he can't put it in the proper time frame...he can't determine whether things happened yesterday_ last week_ or twenty years ago.,My husband was diagnosed with moderate dementia and he  had a hemorrhagic stroke a year ago.  It is difficult to determine how much of his problem is from the stroke and how much is from the dementia.  The doctor has added Wellbutrin to help with the depression; he's only been taking it for a week along with the Celexa he was already taking.  There has been no improvement_ yet and his paranoia is getting worse.,M,70,2  months20 mg 1X D,5/21/2015Email,Namenda

8, 1, alzeheimers disease,My mother was prescribed Namenda along with aricept.  after starting the Namenda she began to experience back pain and weakness in her legs.  She could barely stand and needed a walker to get around.  Even that wasn't enough and a wheelchair became necessary.  My mother's cardiologist told us that it was probably the Namenda ( his mother in law had similar symptoms after starting Namenda ) her symptoms ceased after the Namenda was stopped.  Also a physical therapist that was seeing my mother told me that his father had taken Namenda and had side effects of low back pain and leg weakness.  Has anyone else experienced side effects such as these mentioned after taking Namenda ?  I would appreciate any feedback.,,F,79,1  months 1X D,3/1/2012,Namenda
9, 1, Dementia,Mother took namenda for memory problems. Hopeful that it would help her recall and foggy thinking. It gave her anxiety_ uncontrollable rage and panic attacks that were extreme. She developed tremors of her entire body and long episodes of tachycardia (rapid heart rate). Her memory was further impaired after taking namenda. She also had bladder infections while taking namenda. In the opinion of our family namenda was taking her downhill fast. We did not taper down to take her off of the medicine. We quit immediately once we noticed her eyes were glassy and she was physically slowing down. Once off of namenda her panic attacks and tremors continued but began to subside over the course if the next three months. We had to give her Xanax for the tremors and panic attacks. Now she that she is off namenda she is bright_ moving around again_ the panic attacks and tremors are gone and she has an appetite again. I forgot to mention the almost ten pound weight loss in the short time she took this,,F,53,2  months25 mg 1X D,9/28/2011,Namenda
10, 2, Bipolar II,Agititation_ tachycardia,I am Bipolar II_ diagnosed 3 yrs ago_ and the condition has been fairly well managed with three medications (Namenda_ Lamictal_ and a low dose of Seroquel).  In late 2007 I took part in a clinical study that combined Namenda with Lamictal.  The premise was that the two act synergistically for BPD treatment.  I chose to continue with the Namenda after the clinical trial.Over the past couple of years I've had increasing difficulty with agitation and episodes of rapid heartbeat that come out of the blue. I didn't know the cause. Recently_ due to other nasty side effects_ I decided it is time to come off the Lamictal and try something else.  I began the process by titrating down the Namenda (since I am only taking it because of the Lamictal).  To my surprise_ my episodes of agitation and tachycardia have reduced DRAMATICALLY since going off the Namenda (I haven't even started titrating down the Lamictal yet_ so I know it is the Namenda).I've heard anecdotal evidence that Namenda causes agitation in the elderly_ but because it is primarily used for dementia_ it is likely hard to disentangle side effects from the symptoms of the disease.  From my exeperience_ I think it is very likely that Namenda can cause agitation in the elderly!,F,43,3  years10mg 2X D,12/22/2010,Namenda
11, 4, autism,Unknown - user is non-verbal.,"Prescribed for ""off label"" use for my 3.5 year old (now 6 year old) non-verbal son with autism to help with expressive and receptive language.  Did not help with expressive but receptive has skyrocketed.  Not sure if can attribute to solely namenda since he is also on depakote and has had therapy since he was 2.5 but he has made gains in the receptive areas that namenda was supposed to target.",M,6,3  years10mg 1X D,3/8/2010EmailHistory,Namenda
