0, 5, allergies_ post-nasal drip,none,I used to take this every night for my post-nasal drip_ until they stopped carrying it and you could only get plain pseudoephedrine at the pharmacy.  This product worked really well and prevented the stomach full of mucous that would make me sick every morning.  Pseudoephedrine alone does not work for me as I have allergies.  I've since switched to taking a nightly dose of chlorpheniramine maleate_ and it makes my allergies manageable.,F,25,8  years,1/12/2010,Pseudoephedrine hcl and chlorpheniramine maleate
